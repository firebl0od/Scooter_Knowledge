# Scooter Knowledge Base

This repository collects and organizes information about electric scooter setup, maintenance, and troubleshooting. The primary source material is a large Telegram conversation exported from the "VESC help" group. The goal of the project is to extract practical knowledge from the chat logs and document it in a structured, reusable format.

## What's in the processed knowledge base?

The `knowledge/processed/themes/` directory contains **72 professionally formatted documents** covering:

- **28 brand dossiers** covering controllers, motors, and BMS systems from manufacturers like Spintend, Flipsky, Makerbase, 3Shul, and more
- **44 comprehensive guides** including:
  - VESC tuning and parameter optimization
  - Battery pack design and BMS integration
  - Motor cooling and thermal management
  - Conversion guides for popular scooter models (Ninebot, Xiaomi, etc.)
  - Brake upgrades and maintenance
  - Field weakening and high-voltage setups
  - Diagnostic tools and troubleshooting

All documents use a consistent, readable format with:
- Clean footnote citations linking back to source material
- Well-organized sections with proper headings
- Tables and checklists for quick reference
- Preserved technical accuracy from the original discussions

## Workflow overview

1. **Review the raw chat logs** in `data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/`.
2. **Capture potential insights** in the `knowledge/notes` folder. Start with the `extraction_log.md` template to keep track of what has been reviewed.
3. **Distill verified knowledge** into reusable documents in `knowledge/processed`. These can be FAQs, troubleshooting guides, setup checklists, wiring diagrams, or any other format that helps scooter enthusiasts.
4. **Iterate** as more useful information is discovered. Update both notes and processed documents to reflect the latest understanding.

## Getting started

- The Telegram export consists of multiple JSON parts (`input_part000.json`, `input_part001.json`, …). Each file follows the format generated by Telegram's export tool.
- If you prefer working with a different format (for example, Markdown or CSV), create conversion scripts or tooling in a separate folder (e.g. `tools/`), and document their usage in this README.
- Use version control to track significant findings and transformations. Commit notes frequently so the knowledge base evolves transparently.

### Converting Telegram JSON to text

The Telegram export is split into 10 MB `input_partXXX.json` slices that are not valid JSON individually. Use `tools/telegram_to_text.py` to stitch the pieces together and emit a readable transcript:

```bash
python tools/telegram_to_text.py \
    --input data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group \
    --include-service \
    --limit 500 \
    --output knowledge/processed/vesc_help_group/transcript_excerpt.txt
```

- `--include-service` keeps join/leave notifications in the output. Omit it for a people-only transcript.
- `--limit` can restrict the number of lines exported when you need a quick sample.
- Drop `--output` to print the transcript to the terminal instead of saving it.

The example command above generates a 500-line excerpt in `knowledge/processed/vesc_help_group/transcript_excerpt.txt` for fast reference while the full dataset remains in the raw export directory.

### Working with the pre-extracted transcripts

- When you only need a quick look at the chat without stitching JSON parts yourself, open the plain-text slices stored in `data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_partXXX.txt`. Each file mirrors the corresponding Telegram export part and keeps timestamps, senders, and message bodies for fast skimming.
- Use these text files as lightweight references while taking structured notes. They pair well with the extraction log in `knowledge/notes/extraction_log.md`, letting you cross-reference notable findings without leaving the repository.

## Contributing guidelines

- Keep raw data untouched. Perform any cleaning or transformation in new files so the original context remains available.
- When adding new knowledge documents, include metadata such as the source message link, date, author, and any assumptions or hardware configurations.
- Structure processed documents for readability. Use headings, bullet lists, tables, and diagrams where appropriate.
- All processed documents should use footnote citations (e.g., `[^1]`) rather than inline citations to maintain readability.

## Document formatting standards

All processed knowledge documents follow these formatting conventions:

- **Footnote citations**: Technical claims link to source material using footnote references (`[^1]`, `[^2]`, etc.) with a References section at the end
- **Visual hierarchy**: Proper spacing around headers and sections
- **Structured content**: Tables, bullet lists, and sub-bullets for easy scanning
- **Preserved accuracy**: All technical content is maintained from the original sources

## Project Status

### Current State
- **72 processed knowledge documents** (44 guides + 28 brand dossiers)
- **Extraction progress**: ~44% complete across 17 review files
- **Quality metrics**: 99.98% unique content (0.0% duplication)
- **Recent work**: All open PRs merged, readability improvements applied

### Status Reports
- See `EXTRACTION_STATUS.md` for detailed extraction progress by file
- See `DEDUPLICATION_REPORT.md` for content quality analysis
- See `MERGE_SUMMARY.md` for PR merge history

### Remaining Work
- **~6,800 lines** of knowledge to extract from review files
- See EXTRACTION_STATUS.md for prioritized extraction queue

## Future improvements

- Build scripts to parse and index the chat logs for quick reference.
- Create thematic summaries (e.g. battery management, motor tuning, firmware updates).
- Add tagging or cross-referencing between notes and processed documents for easier navigation.
- Complete extraction of remaining review content into processed documents.

Happy knowledge mining!
