# Scooter Knowledge Base

This repository collects and organizes information about electric scooter setup, maintenance, and troubleshooting. The primary source material is a large Telegram conversation exported from the "VESC help" group. The goal of the project is to extract practical knowledge from the chat logs and document it in a structured, reusable format.

```

## Workflow overview

1. **Review the raw chat logs** in `data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/`.
2. **Capture potential insights** in the `knowledge/notes` folder. Start with the `extraction_log.md` template to keep track of what has been reviewed.
3. **Distill verified knowledge** into reusable documents in `knowledge/processed`. These can be FAQs, troubleshooting guides, setup checklists, wiring diagrams, or any other format that helps scooter enthusiasts.
4. **Iterate** as more useful information is discovered. Update both notes and processed documents to reflect the latest understanding.

## Getting started

- The Telegram export consists of multiple JSON parts (`input_part000.json`, `input_part001.json`, …). Each file follows the format generated by Telegram's export tool.
- If you prefer working with a different format (for example, Markdown or CSV), create conversion scripts or tooling in a separate folder (e.g. `tools/`), and document their usage in this README.
- Use version control to track significant findings and transformations. Commit notes frequently so the knowledge base evolves transparently.

### Converting Telegram JSON to text

The Telegram export is split into 10 MB `input_partXXX.json` slices that are not valid JSON individually. Use `tools/telegram_to_text.py` to stitch the pieces together and emit a readable transcript:

```
python tools/telegram_to_text.py \
    --input data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group \
    --include-service \
    --limit 500 \
    --output knowledge/processed/vesc_help_group/transcript_excerpt.txt
```

- `--include-service` keeps join/leave notifications in the output. Omit it for a people-only transcript.
- `--limit` can restrict the number of lines exported when you need a quick sample.
- Drop `--output` to print the transcript to the terminal instead of saving it.

The example command above generates a 500-line excerpt in `knowledge/processed/vesc_help_group/transcript_excerpt.txt` for fast reference while the full dataset remains in the raw export directory.

## Contributing guidelines

- Keep raw data untouched. Perform any cleaning or transformation in new files so the original context remains available.
- When adding new knowledge documents, include metadata such as the source message link, date, author, and any assumptions or hardware configurations.
- Structure processed documents for readability. Use headings, bullet lists, tables, and diagrams where appropriate.

## Future improvements

- Build scripts to parse and index the chat logs for quick reference.
- Create thematic summaries (e.g. battery management, motor tuning, firmware updates).
- Add tagging or cross-referencing between notes and processed documents for easier navigation.

Happy knowledge mining!
