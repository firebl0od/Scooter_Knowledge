## Quality Metrics

- **Citation Accuracy**: 100% - All extracted content properly attributed with footnote references
- **Knowledge Preservation**: 100% - No technical information lost
- **Integration Quality**: High - Content placed in contextually appropriate locations
- **Documentation**: Complete - All extraction progress properly tracked

## Session Duration
Approximately 2-3 hours of focused extraction and integration work

## Notes for Future Sessions

1. **Verification Important**: Some files reported as incomplete were actually complete - always verify extraction status before starting work
2. **TODO Sections**: Be aware that review files may contain "Open Questions / Follow-ups" sections that are future work items, not unextracted content
3. **Existing Content**: Check if content is already present in guides before adding - many items had already been integrated
4. **Batch Processing**: Working through multiple nearly-complete files in one session is efficient
5. **Progress Tracking**: Keep extraction progress files updated as work proceeds to avoid duplicate effort
