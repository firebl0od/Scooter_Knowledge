# Aerlang 500 W Scooter Dossier

## TL;DR

- Out-of-the-box package combines a compact 48 V/25 A controller with built-in Bluetooth, app-based lighting, horn, and alarm control, paired to a 48 V 17.5 Ah battery and supple rear suspension for roughly €400 street pricing—good for about 45 km/h once derestricted.[^1]
- The otherwise polished commuter chassis hides a critical flaw: the flat deck plate work-hardens and cracks at the steering neck or rear suspension mounts unless it is reinforced before sustained high-speed riding.[^1]
- Firmware is read/write locked, leaving shunt tweaks as the only sanctioned power mod and making wholesale controller swaps the practical upgrade path.[^2]
- Legal 25 km/h mode can be re-engaged with an eight-click input sequence, letting riders present a compliant profile during inspections and unlock full power when conditions allow.[^3]

## Platform Snapshot

| Focus | Stock Insight | Upgrade Levers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Electronics & UX | Integrated controller manages throttle, braking, lighting, horn, Bluetooth app, and alarm, and has proven reliable in community use.[^1] | Because the firmware is encrypted, riders either live within the stock feature set or plan full controller replacements (e.g., VESC conversions) if they need custom logic.[^2] |
| Battery & Performance | Factory 48 V 17.5 Ah module and 45 km/h ceiling give the Aerlang one of the strongest legal-mode packages in its price class.[^1] | Unlocking the speed cap requires only the built-in click sequence, so keep a derestricted profile ready for private roads while preserving legal mode for public areas.[^3] |
| Chassis & Ride Quality | Ten-inch wheels and a notably plush rear suspension deliver a refined ride for urban commuting straight from the box.[^1] | Before adding power or mileage, budget time for welding or gusseting around the deck’s neck and rear suspension mounts to prevent catastrophic cracks.[^1] |
| Value Positioning | Street pricing around €400 places the scooter in accessible territory for riders wanting a high-spec legal machine.[^1] | Invest savings into structural reinforcement and safety gear rather than incremental electronics mods that the locked firmware won’t expose.[^1][^2] |

## Structural Priorities

- Inspect the deck plate for early signs of bending near the steering column and rear suspension bosses; repeated pothole or speed-bump impacts can precipitate sudden fractures without much warning.[^1]
- Reinforcement options include welding gussets along the neck interface or fabricating a boxed deck section before raising speed limits, ensuring the platform stays intact under the scooter’s full 45 km/h potential.[^1]

## Compliance & Mode Management

- Keep the factory 25 km/h cap engaged in jurisdictions with strict micromobility limits, demonstrating compliance on demand and reducing the chance of roadside confiscation.[^3]
- Memorise the eight-click derestriction to toggle between “police mode” and full output without external tools; practice re-locking quickly so an officer cannot simply press a mode button to expose a higher setting.[^3]

## Modification Outlook

- Because software access is encrypted, shunt modifications are the only native path to raise current—use them sparingly to avoid overstressing the stock harness and thermal design.[^2]
- Riders considering advanced telemetry, custom ride modes, or higher current ceilings should plan for a full controller transplant (e.g., VESC), treating the stock electronics as a sealed system best left intact until a replacement is ready.[^2]

## Ramp-Up Checklist for New Owners

1. **Baseline inspection** – Photograph the deck welds and suspension mounts before the first ride to document any factory defects and guide future reinforcement work.[^1]
2. **Legal mode drill** – Practice the eight-click limit toggle while stationary so compliance checks are quick and confident.[^3]
3. **Upgrade roadmap** – Decide early whether to live within the sealed firmware or scope a controller swap; ordering parts ahead avoids downtime once the structural reinforcements are complete.[^2]
