# Heatbox Controllers

## Overview

Heatbox produces high-voltage VESC-compatible motor controllers for electric scooters and e-bikes. Their legacy 100V/100A units are known for robust hardware but have specific wiring considerations that builders need to understand before installation.

## üí° Why Choose Heatbox?

‚úÖ **High Voltage**: 100V rating for multi-series builds
‚úÖ **Robust Hardware**: Legacy design with proven reliability
‚ö†Ô∏è **Trade-offs**: Wiring quirks, mis-pinned harnesses common, limited modern features

## üìã Quick Specifications

| Model | Voltage Rating | Current Rating | Key Features | Common Issue |
|-------|----------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|
| Heatbox 100V/100A | 100V | 100A | Keyed three-wire ignition | Mis-pinned harnesses |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Heatbox Warnings

üî¥ **Red Wire ‚â† Positive**: Supply positive NOT always red‚Äîverify every wire with multimeter
üî¥ **Mis-Pinned Common**: Low voltage at ignition = wiring problem, not firmware brick
üî¥ **Legacy Design**: No firmware-selectable jumpers‚Äîphysical wiring must be perfect
üî¥ **Verify Before Power**: Trace and document all leads before first power-up

## üí° Pro Tips

- **Multimeter first**: Test every wire before assuming color coding
- **Photo reference**: Find community wiring diagrams before touching harness
- **Document your unit**: Color codes may vary‚Äîlabel everything
- **Repinning OK**: Don't fear connector rework if mis-pinned

## Known Issues & Solutions

### Ignition Harness Wiring

**Problem**: Controllers may show only a few tenths of a volt at the ignition pins

**Common Cause**: The ignition harness is mis-pinned, not a firmware issue[^1]

**Background**: Legacy Heatbox 100V/100A units ship with a keyed three-wire ignition loom that lacks firmware-selectable jumpers. This means the physical wiring must be correct for the controller to power on properly.

#### Diagnosis Steps

1. **Check voltage at ignition pins** with a multimeter
2. **If reading is very low** (few tenths of a volt): Assume mis-pinned harness
3. **Don't assume firmware is bricked** - it's usually a wiring issue

#### Repair Procedure

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Warning**: Supply positive is NOT always the red wire on Heatbox harnesses! Always verify before connecting power.[^2]

**Wire Color Verification**:[^2]
1. Locate community reference photos (check e-scooter forums)
2. Identify each conductor with a multimeter
3. Trace every lead from source to destination
4. Document your specific unit's color coding
5. Only after verification, repin the connector if needed

**Repinning Process**:
1. Carefully extract pins from the keyed connector housing
2. Reference the verified pinout
3. Insert pins in the correct positions
4. Double-check with multimeter before energizing
5. Test keyswitch function at low voltage first

## Safety Considerations

### Before First Power-Up

- [ ] Verify all wire colors with multimeter
- [ ] Check ignition harness pinout against known-good reference
- [ ] Confirm keyswitch operates correctly
- [ ] Test at reduced voltage if possible
- [ ] Have emergency disconnect ready

### Why This Matters

Incorrect ignition wiring can:
- Prevent the controller from powering on
- Potentially damage the control logic if power is applied to wrong pins
- Create frustrating troubleshooting sessions mistaken for firmware issues

## Support & Resources

### Where to Find Help

- E-scooter community forums for reference photos
- VESC community Discord channels
- Heatbox distributor/reseller support channels

### Documentation Gaps

Currently, there's limited official documentation on:
- Standard wire color coding
- Pinout diagrams for ignition harnesses
- Firmware configuration options

Community-sourced photos and reverse-engineering have filled these gaps.

## Comparison with Other Brands

**vs. Spintend/Makerbase**: Heatbox units use a keyed three-wire design rather than firmware-configurable ignition, requiring more careful physical setup.

**vs. Flipsky**: Similar voltage/current ratings but different approach to power switching‚ÄîHeatbox relies on proper harness wiring rather than software configuration.

## When to Choose Heatbox

**Good Fit If**:
- You need proven 100V operation
- You're comfortable with manual harness verification
- You want robust hardware
- You can access community support for wiring

**Consider Alternatives If**:
- You want plug-and-play ignition
- You need firmware-configurable power switching
- You require extensive manufacturer documentation
- You're new to controller installations

## Maintenance Tips

- Keep spare connectors and pins for harness repairs
- Document your specific unit's wire colors with photos
- Store pinout information with the controller
- Inspect ignition connections periodically for corrosion
