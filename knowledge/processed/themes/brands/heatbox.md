# Heatbox Controller Notes

## Ignition Harness Troubleshooting
- Legacy Heatbox 100 V/100 A units ship with a keyed three-wire loom that lacks firmware-selectable jumpers—if the controller only shows a few tenths of a volt at the ignition pins, assume the leads are mis-pinned rather than bricked firmware.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L409-L414】
- Confirm conductor colours before repinning; community reference photos show supply positive is not always the red wire, so trace every lead before energising the keyswitch feed.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L413-L417】
