# RFP Controller & Frame Notes

## TL;DR

- Production RFP controllers have earned a “set-and-forget” reputation for daily Jetson/commuter duty so long as battery current stays moderate, standing out as one of the few plug-and-ride options in the group’s mixed fleets.[^1]
- RFP’s extended frame leaves roughly 15 cm more battery bay than stock Thunder layouts, opening space for dual Tronic Seven-class controllers and 22 S 11 P Eve 40PL packs as builders stage their upgrades.[^2]

## Upgrade Roadmap

- Yamal plans to validate high-KV motors on his Nami before moving them into the RFP chassis; if torque or thermal headroom falls short he’ll swap to 75H 22/3 hubs and chase ~600 A phase / 350–400 A battery per controller once the bay is reworked.[^3]

## Integration Checklist

1. **Map controller placement early.** The longer bay makes dual-controller layouts practical—reserve mounting points and airflow paths for front and rear stages before wiring.[^2]
2. **Stage pack upgrades.** Begin with the 22 S 11 P Eve 40PL pack the frame was dimensioned around, then revisit traction-control and thermal limits before pushing currents toward the planned 600 A phase target.[^4]
