# Minimotors Platform Notes

## Thunder 3 Roadmap

- Thunder 3 has been homologated as Spain’s first 72 V-legal scooter from January 2027 onward, making certified frames mandatory for future road compliance even though the chassis looks unchanged from earlier runs.[^1]
- Fresh Lonnyo 80 H motors for Thunder-class builds arrive without rims for about €736, include hall/temperature sensors, and require 155 mm fork openings—test them on a known chassis (e.g., Nami) before committing to a wider RFP frame.[^2]

## EY3 Display Integration

- Flipsky FT85BD controllers and their Ubox Lite clones still need the VSETT Lisp bridge to speak EY3 protocol; riders warn that leaving the bridge’s throttle passthrough lead unplugged has already killed displays, so treat the adapter as part of the harness rather than an optional accessory.[^3]
