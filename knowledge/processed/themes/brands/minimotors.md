# Minimotors Platform Notes

## Thunder 3 Roadmap

- Thunder 3 has been homologated as Spain’s first 72 V-legal scooter from January 2027 onward, making certified frames mandatory for future road compliance even though the chassis looks unchanged from earlier runs.[^1]
- Fresh Lonnyo 80 H motors for Thunder-class builds arrive without rims for about €736, include hall/temperature sensors, and require 155 mm fork openings—test them on a known chassis (e.g., Nami) before committing to a wider RFP frame.[^2]
