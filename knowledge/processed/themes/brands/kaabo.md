# Kaabo & Wolf King Scooters

## Overview

Kaabo produces electric scooters including the Wolf King GT and Mantis series. Known for durable, all-weather commuter frames, these scooters also serve as platforms for high-power conversions. However, there are documented safety concerns (Mantis fires), structural maintenance needs, and packaging constraints that builders must understand.

## What You Need to Know

- Wolf King GT is a proven all-weather commuter platform
- Mantis series has fire safety concerns (underspec batteries, poor crimps)
- Stock welding and BMS often inadequate for high-power builds
- Deck packaging constrains dual-controller installations
- Regular steering column maintenance required

## 💡 Why Choose Kaabo?

✅ **All-Weather Durability**: Wolf King GT proven in harsh conditions
✅ **High-Power Ready**: Mantis handles 21S-24S, ~32kW peaks
✅ **Deck Space**: Good for large battery packs
⚠️ **Trade-offs**: Mantis fire risk, deck too narrow for dual controllers without external mounting

## 📋 Quick Model Comparison

| Model | Stock Config | Deck Volume | Best For | Critical Issue |
|-------|-------------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| Wolf King GT | 20S7P 21700 | 172×70×430mm | All-weather commuter | Narrow deck for duals |
| Mantis | Varies | Good | High-power builds | **Fire safety concerns** |

## ⚠️ Critical Kaabo Warnings

🔴 **Mantis Fire Risk**: Recurring fires blamed on underspec batteries and poor crimps
🔴 **Deck Width Limit**: Only 70mm usable—forces external controller mounting for duals
🔴 **Stock Welding Weak**: Reinforce before high-power upgrades
🔴 **BMS Inadequate**: Replace stock BMS for performance builds

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Wolf King for reliability**: Proven commuter platform over Mantis
- **External controllers**: Plan external mounting for dual-motor builds
- **Battery replacement**: Budget for quality pack rebuild on Mantis
- **Regular inspection**: Check steering column and welds frequently

## Safety Concerns - Mantis Fires

### The Problem

**Documented Fire Issues**:[^5][^6]
- Recurring Mantis fires
- **Including parked scooters**
- Root causes:
  - Underspec batteries
  - Poor crimps
  - Inadequate fusing

### Fuse Response Issue

**Kaabo's Inadequate Protection**:[^5]
- Kaabo used 40A fuse
- Actual draw: 55A
- Fuse rating too low for normal operation
- Deepened community distrust
- Reports of regional blacklist

> **⚠️ Safety Warning**: If you own a Mantis, inspect your battery pack thoroughly. Consider upgrading BMS and improving all electrical connections. Never leave charging unattended.

## High-Power Conversions

### Wolf King GT Upgrades

**Current Limitations**:[^1]
- Stock Daly packs sag near 160A combined
- Trip protection at 22S with high current
- Stock welding inadequate

**Required Upgrades for 20kW+**:[^1]
1. **Busbar upgrades** - Stock welding insufficient
2. **Higher-spec BMS** - Daly can't handle burst currents
3. **Thermal monitoring** - Essential at high power
4. **Controller placement** - Plan before pushing limits

### Dual Controller Installations

**Packaging Challenges**:[^2]
- Wolf decks fit one large controller stock
- Dual controllers require:
  - 3D-printed spacers
  - Staggered mounting
  - Careful cable routing
  - 10mm² phase leads
  - Heavier harnessing

**Avoiding Issues**:[^2][^3]
- Don't pinch cables
- Plan thermal management
- Route wiring away from hot components
- Budget wiring changes upfront

### Custom Phase Looms

**For >300A Launches**:[^3]
- Order custom 3mm rotors
- Use 10mm² phase looms
- Have CAD ready for rotor suppliers
- Budget thicker cabling
- Stops voltage drop on high-current pulls

### Example Build: GT with 50S Cells

**Configuration**:[^gt_50s_build]
- 72V 50Ah Samsung 50S pack
- 2000W (33/3) hub
- Spintend 85V 240A controller
- Baseline for experimentation

## Mantis High-Density Builds

### Extreme Power Configuration

**Simone's Build**:[^mantis_high_density]
- 21S6P Samsung 35E pack
- Some push to 24S7P
- ~32kW peaks at 82V
- Requires spacers under deck
- External cooling essential
- SmartDisplay telemetry
