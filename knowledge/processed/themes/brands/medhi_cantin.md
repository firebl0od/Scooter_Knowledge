## Build Notes

- Expect significant lead time (≈1 year) for a turnkey chassis; the program targets race teams willing to invest in bespoke metalwork rather than quick deck swaps.[^1]
- Dual-controller packaging is baked into the frame from the outset, so plan harness routing and cooling with Kelly-class hardware in mind when reserving a slot.[^1]
