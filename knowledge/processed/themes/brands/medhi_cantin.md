# Medhi Cantin Custom Frame Program

## Overview
- French racer Medhi Cantin is machining billet 7075 scooter frames around dual Kelly 7230S controllers, illustrating the year-long fabrication timelines behind competitive stand-up builds.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L21-L21】

## Build Notes
- Expect significant lead time (≈1 year) for a turnkey chassis; the program targets race teams willing to invest in bespoke metalwork rather than quick deck swaps.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L21-L21】
- Dual-controller packaging is baked into the frame from the outset, so plan harness routing and cooling with Kelly-class hardware in mind when reserving a slot.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L21-L21】
