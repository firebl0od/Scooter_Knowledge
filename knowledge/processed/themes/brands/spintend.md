# Spintend Controllers Brand Dossier

## TL;DR
- Community veterans now default to Spintend when budget Makerbase/Flipsky boards melt down—the Ubox lineup shrugs off BMS trips and keeps scooters rolling where 75xxx-class ESCs lock wheels or self-destruct under the same abuse.[^1]
- Riders note that even when undersized hubs fail catastrophically, Spintend’s 100 V Lite shrugged off the shorts—GABE killed three commuter motors in two days without harming the controller, underscoring the brand’s resilience to motor-side faults.[^motor-survival]
- Yamal has already logged roughly 2,500 km hammering 200 A battery/phase on a Spintend build without failures, highlighting how meticulous wiring and conservative validation keep the hardware alive even for heavy daily use.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L759-L765】
- Even with the shared “no limits” firmware, single Ubox installs treat ~80 A battery and 130 A phase as the sensible ceiling—the hardware clamp near 300 A still applies, so cooling and telemetry matter more than chasing the unlocked config file.[^40]
- Early 85250 V1 controllers used current-transformer sensing that saturates near 100 A and complicates auto-detection, so Smart Repair now nudges heavy builds toward shunt-based MK8/X12 footprints (or waits for the teased 18-FET refresh) unless the board has been reworked with proven Toll MOSFETs.[^ct_limit]
- Thermal success hinges on treating every Spintend as a passively cooled module: clamp the aluminum base to a 3–5 mm plate with paste or pads and reserve generous deck space for 25 × 15 cm heatsinks so dual stacks stay below ~70 °C.[^2]
- Stock pad stacks combine a 2 mm × 1.1 cm × 9.6 cm strip with a 0.5 mm × 2.4 cm × 9.6 cm shim; swapping to uniform 1 mm sheets with proper clamp pressure has dropped single-Ubox temperatures from 68 °C at 110 A to 49 °C at 142 A on icy rides, underscoring contact pressure over exotic materials.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L549-L550】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L565-L566】
- Treat the ADC lighting bridge as an accessory tap, not a main switch—its ~12 V / 3 A rail and updated harnesses simplify pods and brake throttles, but real kill circuits still require relays, smart-BMS buttons, or loop keys.[^3]
- The compact V100 revision leans on higher-Rdson MOSFETs plus revised copper tracing to shed heat, yet riders still beg for smaller cases, front-facing connectors, integrated Bluetooth, and direct MOSFET-to-heatsink clamps with copper bars.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L592-L593】
- Stock MOSFETs still fail when builders push >40 A of field weakening on 20 S packs; plan on HY- or HSBL-class swaps before chasing high-ERPM targets on 85150/85250 hardware.[^20]
- Random throttle surges continue to surface on 85 V/240 A, 100 V/100 A, and even v2 85 V/250 A units, so budget time for filtering, shielded cabling, and harness inspections when diagnosing jitter complaints.[^17]
- Spintend sunset the 85/250 and now routes the 85/240 through a New Jersey hub for U.S. buyers—stock spares if you rely on the higher-rated board because the replacement is easier to source but capped a touch lower.[^logistics_update]
- EU buyers still shoulder VAT and customs surprises on accessories—expect €30 invoices on €20 parcels until Spintend rolls IOSS collection or a prepaid tax option into checkout.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L20979-L21033】
- V2 thermal telemetry reads hotter than V1 under the same rides because of NTC placement and extra phase current; reverting to stock pads outperformed fancy Thermal Grizzly swaps, so fix clamp pressure before chasing exotic materials.[^v2_ntc]
- The public 5.3 firmware drop split testers—some love the smoother acoustics, others are holding 5.2 until side-by-side runs prove the update isn’t hiding regressions, so archive binaries and logs before flashing.[^fw53_release]
- V2 boards ship with self-reset fuses on every 5 V/12 V/3.3 V rail, but VESC Tool 3.01 still crashes during ADC calibration if 5 V throttles land on the STM32 input—stick to 3.00/5.2 firmware or add dividers before sealing decks.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L8424-L8453】

## Inbound QC & Power-Up Protocol
1. **Full teardown and dry clean before first power.** Crack the enclosure, remove conformal covers, vacuum or IPA-wipe solder balls, and inspect gate-driver rails prior to energising the board.[^41]
   - Second-hand single-case uBox controllers have turned up with stray solder balls, uneven MOSFET pad contact, and phase leads chafing through silicone grommets—strip the shell, clean, and add insulation before trusting a resale unit.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L20826-L20905】
   - Newer housings now fasten with four screws and side-facing ports, but riders still open fresh units to clear stray solder before the first ride.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L509-L510】
2. **Torque and upgrade the high-current connectors.** Swap factory XT90 jumpers for QS8/AS150-class hardware or busbars with proper lugs, and route control wiring through shielded CAT6A pairs to avoid melted solder-only links.[^42]
3. **Hunt for stray conductive debris.** Rental-fleet autopsies found solder beads bridging phase outputs on dual installs—confirm nothing rattles inside before closing the case.[^43]
4. **Respect symmetric power loops.** When disconnecting packs, pull both battery leads or open the main contactor before touching CAN; popping one lead while the bus is live has blown Ubox Lite ESD protection.[^44]
5. **Document baseline idle draw.** Expect roughly 20 mA standby current with the latching power button off—any illuminated switch LED signals a wiring fault.[^45]
6. **Only enable the phase filter during detection.** Spintend confirmed the toggle exists to stabilise the motor wizard; leaving it on while riding injects noise and can resurrect ABS overcurrent faults.[^54]
7. **Check for copper busbars and debris on arrival.** Early 75 V betas exposed copper bars while some 100 V runs hide higher-Rds(on) MOSFETs under resin and ship with loose solder balls—open every case and confirm the busbar stack before trusting marketing photos.[^u75_vs100]
7. **Bench-test current-sense offsets before installation.** Three of four UBOX Single 100/100 boards arrived with shorted op-amps reporting nonsensical offsets (30–4,000 counts), and a working unit blew input capacitors during a routine reconnect—validate sensor readings before trusting controllers in builds.[^qc_input004]
8. **Check Bluetooth harness polarity on fresh Ubox units.** A new 80 V single shipped with its BLE lead reversed, killing the module immediately—verify continuity before power-up.[^bt_polarity]

## Product Line Cheat Sheet
| Model | Nominal Pack Window | Field Envelope & Use Case | Distinguishing Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dual Ubox 75/100 | 16–20 S | ≈150 A phase per side when cooled properly; duals still popular for compact dual-motor decks | Legacy two-in-one chassis remains a 75 V-class unit that survives racing loads when given airflow.[^4] |
| Ubox Lite (single) | 16–20 S | ≈150 A battery/phase; dual Lite = two singles under one lid | Lite boards share hardware with the dual 100/100, letting riders mix singles or duals to balance heat against mounting simplicity, but the aluminum “Lite” case only exposes a small 12 V logic feed—budget an external buck for real accessory loads.[^5][^lite_12v] |
| Ubox 85/200 (12‑FET) | 18–22 S | 250 A battery / ~350 A phase with cooling; dual stacks log ~500 A combined bursts | Tuners report faults only past ~450 A phase when thermals are dialed in, making the 12‑FET the workhorse for 20–22 S superbikes.[^6] |
| Ubox 85/240 (rev.) | 18–22 S (marketing 24 S with care) | Targeting ~240 A battery in a smaller shell for tight decks | New single-chassis revision ships with 8 AWG leads, reversible exits, and a lower price than the outgoing 250 A model, prompting direct-import demand.[^7] |
| Dual 75/100 (early rev.) | 16–20 S | Needs external filtering for the noisiest installs | First batches omitted phase filters; retrofit boards or external filters tame switching noise on sensitive builds.[^8] |
| Single-board prototype | 16–22 S (target) | Paolo estimates ≈150 A battery on flat roads once firmware stabilises | Current revision is ~60 mm wide without the case, adds capacitance versus a Nucular 12F, and still needs external sealing before living in wet decks.[^single-proto] |

Spintend now colour-codes dual Ubox trims—red prioritises current for commuter tunes, purple adds TVS protection for safer 18 S work, and black pairs with 22 S builds so long as e-brake regen is capped under ~80 V—so log the shell colour before assuming voltage headroom.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L223-L223】

## Operating Guardrails
### Battery & Phase Current Targets
- Stock firmware keeps 85‑250 hardware near 150 A battery / 200 A phase continuous, with seasoned tuners only flashing no-limit binaries once motors and cooling can stomach 400 A phase spikes.[^9]
- Smart Repair’s track-tested window keeps refreshed 85 250/240 stacks reliable around 380 A phase, 480 A absolute, and ~200 A battery once you strip paint, add thermal paste, and clamp the base to added aluminum mass.[^smartrepair_85250]
- The revised 85250 V2 may handle 22 S, but early adopters are still collecting long-term data before trusting race builds at ≈92 V—treat the voltage headroom as experimental until logs prove otherwise.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L709-L710】
- Daily riders now treat 85150s as ~150 A battery / 250 A phase hardware even after flashing the no-limits BIN; pushing harder cooked stock-firmware units within days when regen stayed disabled.[^safe_envelope]
- **Single Ubox 100/100 daily safe zone:** Lonnyo 65 H commuters are holding tunes near 130–135 A phase with 85–90 A battery and 150–180 A absolute, trimming duty to ~98 % and starting FW around 88 % to clear residual stutter without climbing past 40 °C case temps.[^u100_daily]
- With upgraded MOT1111T silicon and external cooling, riders have logged ~480 A phase bursts per controller on 85250 stacks—proof the hardware has headroom when thermals are engineered properly.[^hackintosh_burst]
- Field logs from daily 18 S commuters show 85150 hardware getting unhappy above ~240 A phase; trimming tunes to roughly 220 A phase, 90 A battery, and ≈60 A of field weakening kept case temps stable without neutering performance.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part013.txt†L3769-L3770】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part013.txt†L4184-L4184】
- Real-world logs show dual Lite builds requesting 160/140 A phase yet barely topping 100 A peaks, underscoring the need to capture data from both controllers before chasing higher numbers.[^10]
- Solo commuters copying the shared 300 A hardware-limit BIN still hold tunes near 80 A battery / 130 A phase until they validate heatsinking and airflow; the file only removes software clamps—it does not grant extra headroom.[^40]
- Dual mini stacks are staying around 200 A battery (≈300 A phase) per controller until upgraded housings and airflow arrive; earlier 500 A battery pushes tripped protection even with case temperatures in check.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L558-L559】
- Firmware bundles ship in 100 A and 300 A flavours; Smart Repair urges riders to stay on the 100 A pack for warranty support because the higher bin both voids coverage and still bottlenecks battery input near 60 A even when phase currents spike around 147 A.[^firmware-bins]
- Even the new 85/240 single pushes 80 H hubs toward 95 km/h on 22 S, so the smaller shell still demands proper cooling and current discipline before chasing dual-motor-class speeds.[^u85240_speed]
- Heavy riders continue blowing 12‑FET stages even with modest throttle inputs; treat 20 S commuter builds as derated compared with lightweight race scooters and reserve “fat VESC” footprints when riders plus cargo exceed ~120 kg.[^18]
- Start with conservative dual-drive baselines: 17 S builds have settled near 2×120 A phase / 2×90 A battery / 2×180 A absolute, while 16 S commuters ride closer to 2×100 A phase / 2×60 A battery until thermal logs show headroom.[^30]
- Remember the Spintend bridge mirrors battery current to both controllers—profile toggles or 1WD/2WD switches must isolate CAN or power, otherwise the smaller front ESC still sees the rear controller’s amps.[^bridge_mirror]
- Respect the published 17 S ceiling on 75 V duals (16 S with heavy regen) unless you move to the 100 V “black” chassis; red/purple shells run different FET stacks and leave less margin for 20 S experiments.[^voltage_ceiling]

### Voltage & Regen Discipline
- Riders stepping into 22 S still back off charge voltage or disable heavy regen to avoid 100 V spike failures that plague 75xxx competitors; Ubox-class controllers tolerate the packs but demand measured braking ramps.[^11]
- Arnau’s attempt to run an 85/150 at 22 S/150 A with MOSFET swaps reignited warnings that stock silicon only survives if regen stays off—veterans now suggest jumping to Rage Mechanics’ C350 when 30 S headroom is truly required.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L524-L526】
- Ubox 100/100 revisions still cap regen safely below full pack voltage; Smart Repair warns the stage ships without ST-Link pads or beefy 12 V rails and arrives set around 135 A phase / 180 A absolute until you validate cooling.[^u100_baseline]
- Firmware caps near 300 A phase on early 85/200 units until owners compile the unofficial “no limits” branch—use sparingly because support teams treat it as a warranty break.[^12]
- Watch for BMS thermal trips even on Spintend hardware—dual Ubox owners running 2×135 A phase / 2×71 A battery still logged pack over-temp around 90 A spikes; monitor pack sag and internal resistance monthly.[^31]
- Size battery groups for the torque you plan: 65 H motors needed roughly 150–200 A battery per side, and undersized parallel packs tripped companion BMSes when regen slammed add-on modules.[^32]
- Treat BMS cutoffs as glide events, not anchors—Spintend hardware coasts when a pack trips, but trim regen near full charge (≈76.6 V on 20 S) to avoid repeated over-voltage faults.[^1][^33]
- Builders continue popping 85150s on 20 S when they stack MTPA or heavy field weakening on top of aggressive tunes—derate or upgrade MOSFETs before chasing those maps.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L781-L781】
- Replacement HY power stages sourced through Raphaël Foujiwara are still capped at ≤20 S (~400 A phase) unless you add his HF filter and cooling mods; even experienced builders with the new boards are holding off on 22 S experiments until thermal issues are solved.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L31-L31】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L169-L169】
- 17 S pushes on 75 V units demand extra input capacitance and lower charge cutoffs (~4.1 V per cell) to tame back-EMF spikes—seasoned tuners still recommend staying at 16 S because regen and launches can overvoltage the sparse 220 µF bank even after upgrades.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L9584-L9623】

### Interfaces & Telemetry
- The single Ubox keeps CAN, Bluetooth, and USB online simultaneously, so you can run diagnostics and accessory modules without swapping cables—just mind idle draw when parking long-term.[^single-can]
- The onboard fan header feeds a thermostatic 12 V rail only; firmware cannot switch it, so tap a constant 12 V source or external buck for lighting mods instead of relying on that header.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L508-L509】
- Beta accessory boards spotted in March bundle addressable LEDs (likely WS2812/WS2815) and a piezo buzzer alongside throttle inputs, signalling that future Spintend harnesses may ship with built-in lighting and alert control instead of relying on third-party strips.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L629-L630】
- Spintend’s official BLE dongle costs ~€29 on AliExpress but arrives pre-flashed and taxes included; Flipsky’s NRF51822 module has proven a drop-in budget alternative while official stock is thin, whereas other generic NRF boards still need manual flashing before they pair reliably.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L548-L549】[^ble_dongle][^ble_required][^missing_ble]
- Keep Bluetooth enabled even on headless builds—experienced 75100 converts lean on wireless tuning and fault pulls because Spintend hardware is impractical to service without logs in the field.[^ble_required]
- Ubox V2 shipments have turned up without the promised Bluetooth module; the UART header expects a 5 V module on RX/TX/GND, so builders either chase replacements or install third-party BLE boards while tracing any noisy ADC rails back to damaged STM32 inputs.[^missing_ble]
- Avoid USB-only tuning on unplugged decks—laptops feeding the USB-C port without pack power have created destructive ground loops, so either power the controller normally or fall back to Bluetooth/Wi-Fi for configuration.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L20906-L20947】
- Swapping to 10 AWG phase leads now calls for 60–80 W irons and broad tips—portable TS80P pencils can desolder stock 12 AWG but rarely leave clean tin on heavier cable without external heat.[^phase_rework]
- SmartDisplay’s roadmap now includes a “panic button” that flashes legal 125 W/20 km/h limits into connected controllers and a May production target of ~20 simplified enclosures (including central-mount variants), so plan firmware hooks and mounting space if customers expect stealth compliance modes from future Spintend bundles.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L668-L670】

### Field-Weakening & High-Load Limits
- Stock 85150 MOSFETs overheat quickly once you layer 45 A of field weakening on top of 105–120 A battery and 150–175 A phase requests; riders chasing higher ERPMs swap in HY/HSBL Toll packages with hotplate reflow or back FW down to ~50 A at 87 % duty.[^20]
- 85240 hardware is happiest at 20 S—one HY-revision board tolerated 21 S, but pushing to 22 S without auditing supporting components risks the same runaway failures seen on overloaded 12-FET stages.[^22]
- Heavy riders continue blowing 85/250 units even with gentle ramps, so dual-motor “fat VESC” upgrades or derated current ceilings remain the conservative path for >20 S commuters.[^18]

## Thermal & Packaging Playbook
- **Track the 2022 copper-single experiments.** Early feedback from the 75/100 single community showed copper sandwich plates and resin potting still cooked past 80 °C once riders pushed 130 A phase, so reviewers started trialing graphite pads and waiting on the promised aluminum-core revision before ordering more copper hardware.[^graphite_triage]
- Mount each ESC against aluminum with thermal compound on both faces; copper spacers are discouraged because corrosion outweighs the modest conductivity gain once you already have aluminum-to-aluminum contact.[^2]
- Builders tackling enclosed decks such as the Wepoor are now templating custom fin stacks and machining bolt strips so 12‑FET stages clamp directly to aluminum, rather than hanging remote heatsinks that leave MOSFETs to cook.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L683-L685】
- Retain or improve OEM pad compression—Ubox V2 temperature deltas often trace back to NTC placement and clamp pressure more than exotic pad swaps.[^25]
- Yamal is pairing 8 mm Amass bullets for battery feeds with Juliet signal connectors on his 80 H builds so dual-controller looms stay serviceable without dangling CAN leads.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L589-L589】
- Bolt controllers directly to bare metal structure: sand paint, polish deck plates, and clamp the Ubox to aluminum or copper spreaders to hold MOSFETs near 55 °C at 50 A battery / 120 A phase.[^26]
- Maintain pad thickness discipline; thicker thermal replacements have pushed case temps toward 70 °C when compression was lost.[^27]
- Mirko’s 15 mm aluminum baseplate plus open-deck airflow kept dual 190 A phase / 70 A battery pulls near 52 °C, underscoring how enclosure design matters as much as MOSFET choice when evaluating upcoming aluminum-core revisions.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L12443-L12494】
- Mount 6‑FET minis on 3–5 mm aluminum plates with paste on both faces—copper sandwiches corrode faster than they help once you already couple to aluminum.[^28]
- Share load across dual drives when possible: single-controller hill climbs hit ~60 °C while dual-drive equivalents stay below 40 °C, underscoring the headroom gained by splitting torque.[^29]
- A single 25 × 15 cm heatsink can host two 12‑FET bodies without fin trimming, giving dual builds a repeatable footprint for under-deck cooling plates.[^2]
- Plan airflow and strain relief so BMS cutoffs do not shock the controllers—Spintend hardware coasts through pack trips, but keeping harnesses tidy prevents the upstream faults that still kill rivals.[^1]
- Connector failures still dominate thermal complaints—melted XT90 jumpers on dual Ubox builds traced to soldered bus bars without copper pigtails, so riders now spec QS8/AS150U/QS8H hardware or machined lugs and route low-current controls through shielded CAT6A pairs.[^connector_upgrade]
- Riders logging 67 °C case temps at 50 A battery / 120 A phase cut that to ~55 °C after sanding deck paint, flattening copper spreaders, and re-seating stock pads before bolting the controller straight to bare aluminum.[^case_prep]
- Bonding the 85150 case to the scooter frame with thermal adhesive and watching per-motor temperature logs helps spot miswired phases or sensor faults before they torch a controller.[^21]
- Re-tap the tiny M2.5 bosses or print adapter plates when mounting 85/240 and Lite boards—the flat housings ship without hardware and benefit from thicker pads or thermal glue plus reinforced brackets.[^mounting_threads]
- Revised 85/240 cases shifted the mounting pattern compared with the older 85/250 “Viking,” forcing riders like Yamal to re-drill legacy heatsinks when stacking mixed controllers.[^heatsink_shift]
- Repurpose dead 75/200 baseplates as aux heat spreaders—JPPL’s stack adds aluminum spacers and CNC clamps while Shlomozero sketches radiator blocks tied into Dualtron side plates to keep HY power stages cool.[^baseplate_spreader]
- When compression is weak, riders are stacking 0.5 mm stock pads with 1 mm Thermal Grizzly sheets and paste-filling seams—MOSFET peaks fell from ~67 °C at 45 A/110 A to ~61 °C at 50 A/130 A, letting single Ubox builds launch at 150 A phase without faults.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L10015-L10202】
- Flip the split case so the MOSFET half sits against metal; leaving the logic side down keeps transistors hot while the MCU stays cool, whereas inverted installs share heat with the chassis and stabilize temps.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L10273-L10314】
- Extreme experiments bolt bare boards to 1 cm aluminum slabs or add copper heat pipes—insulate everything, but expect case temps dropping into the 25–44 °C range at ~110 A phase once the mounting is dialled.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L9226-L9351】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L9333-L9348】
- Warranty tear-downs should end with fresh pads (up to 1 mm), solder-ball cleanup, and gluing the ADC adapter slide switch in the 5 V position so throttle rails stop flickering after reassembly.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L10314-L10343】
- JPPL’s X12 installs highlight the packaging ceiling: the accessory rail only delivers 5 V / 150 mA, so plan on a dedicated buck converter if you need 12 V lighting or telemetry alongside the ADC bridge.[^53]
- Water-cooled loops can hold 85250 cores within ~4 °C of ambient at 90 A battery / 130 A phase, yet those builds still suffer tariff-driven price creep and encourage interest in the teased 18‑FET alternative positioned around €180.[^52]
- Protect exposed decks with sacrificial hardware—Pandalgns’ 100 % infill ASA “anti-fall” sliders bolt under the controller stack and survive low-sides without chewing through housings, so stash the STL alongside mounting hardware plans.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part013.txt†L3633-L3634】

## Wiring & Accessory Integration
- The latest v3 ADC adapter arrives with proper harness plugs; pair it with the documented throttle pinout (3.3 V red, ground black, ADC1 signal) and keep the NRF port free for Bluetooth modules.[^3][^13]
- Budget the ADC rail for light loads only: dual 18 W lamps already stress the ~12 V / 3 A output, so horns, halogens, or RGB kits belong on dedicated DC/DC converters triggered by the adapter or a relay—and Dualtron riders now reserve the rail for brake lights after burning controllers by running both headlight and taillight sets directly.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L430-L431】[^3]
- **Hang heavy accessories on an external buck.** A dedicated 12 V/20 A converter powering horns, pumps, fans, and lights only sips ~4–6 A from a 60 V pack, and trimming controller battery amps preserves BMS headroom during horn spikes.[^accessory_buck]
- When reusing OEM dashes or switches, add pull-down resistors or relays instead of tying controller 5 V rails together—shared ignition lines without isolation have cooked boards in cramped conversions.[^3]
- The ADC adapter already handles turn-signal strips and Spin dial throttles; use the supplied JST harness for ADC3, calibrate legacy Spin Y pods manually, and keep phase leads equal length when trimming looms.[^23]
- Artem’s upcoming scroll throttle keeps dual-screw clamps, reversible hall direction, selectable 3.3 V/5 V outputs, and a €45–55 target price; beta CNC runs land before the injection-molded release so riders can stop replacing €160 pods every crash.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L25592-L25626】
- Sequential LED turn signals still require extra logic; riders rewiring looms from scratch report the VESC signal wires cannot drive cascaded strips directly, so plan dedicated controllers if you expect chase effects.[^seq_led]
- If throttle noise persists, compress the ADC window so idle rests near 0.8–1.0 V, verify chassis grounding, and add filtering before blaming firmware for runaway acceleration reports.[^17][^24]
- Leverage the ADC adapter without killing CAN—run ADC1/2 through the splitter while leaving UART dashboards online, and diode-isolate lighting feeds so traction control and telemetry stay intact.[^34]
- Feed auxiliary rails from a clean supply: Ubox Lite lacks a native 12 V rail, so power the ADC adapter from an external DC-DC while keeping grounds common to prevent lighting glitches.[^35]
- Sequence dash power carefully—Flipsky Smart Display harnesses have already blown multiple ADC daughterboards when 5 V was applied before 12 V; energise the lighting rail first, then logic power, and keep grounds shared.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part013.txt†L2375-L2387】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part013.txt†L3188-L3193】
- Before paralleling both 12 V outputs for accessories, confirm whether your enclosure actually splits regulators; riders probing KOX Smart Display installs suspect some 85× shells share a single buck that cannot sustain doubled loads.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part013.txt†L4085-L4114】
- Mind standby behaviour before adding smart switches—the latching Spintend button already isolates the logic rail with minimal drain; external anti-spark solutions are optional unless you need hard battery isolation.[^45]
- Watch for look-alike FT85BD/Ubox Lite clones: they ship without Minimotors protocol support, so budget a VSETT Lisp bridge and wire its throttle-out lead back into the controller or the dash will brick the clone on first power-up.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21880-L21903】

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Auto-Off Failures on 100/100 Units
- Some Spintend 100/100 controllers refuse to shut down even when ADC auto-off timers are disabled in VESC Tool, indicating accessory power bleed or stuck logic rails preventing proper shutdown.[^autooff-issue]
- **Troubleshooting steps:**
  1. Check for backfeed from auxiliary power sources (displays, lighting, BMS wake circuits) that may be energizing the logic rail.
  2. Verify ADC adapter wiring and confirm no pull-up resistors or external circuits are holding the enable pin high.
  3. Test with all accessories disconnected to isolate whether peripheral power is preventing shutdown.
  4. Consider using smart-BMS discharge control or physical loop keys as backup shutdown methods until root cause is identified.[^autooff-issue]
- Document firmware version, accessory wiring, and ADC adapter configuration when reporting this issue to identify common patterns.[^autooff-issue]

### Spintend Lite Connector Sourcing
- Oreo Huzky's Apollo City Pro conversion highlighted that Spintend Alu Lite logic harnesses use keyed multi-pin plugs that builders must reuse or source when extending looms—part numbers remain undocumented in community threads as of late 2025.[^lite-connector]
- When building or repairing Lite harnesses, photograph factory connectors and measure pin pitch/count before attempting aftermarket substitutes to avoid compatibility issues.[^lite-connector]
- Consider ordering spare connectors directly from Spintend or trusted resellers when planning custom harness work on Lite platforms.[^lite-connector]

## Commissioning & Diagnostics Checklist
1. **Audit firmware limits before tuning.** Confirm the phase ceiling in VESC Tool; early 85/200 units stall at ~300 A until reflashed, and Lite boards mirror duals so mismatched limits skew traction control.[^12][^5]
2. **Flash vendor firmware and let auto-detection pick the hardware profile.** Spintend-supplied BINs and automatic R3 detection remain the safe path; forcing V6 targets or manual overrides has bricked controllers on the bench.[^46]
3. **Validate motor detection results.** Limited-edition hubs have returned ~270 A recommendations despite ~200 A safe limits, and some Ubox V2 units only auto-detect ~88 A versus ~135 A on V1—log outputs and set limits manually when they drift.[^47][^48]
4. **Disable regen during PSU testing.** Spinning up field-weakening on a bench supply can over-voltage the source; keep regen off until testing on a full battery stack.[^49]
5. **Capture fault codes before power-cycling.** If ABS overcurrent trips during early rides, dump VESC `faults` logs before rebooting so you can correlate spikes with wiring or observer changes.[^50]
6. **Log both controllers on every shakedown.** Aggregate CAN data to verify commanded vs. actual amps; many “weak” builds simply read one side and miss per-motor dropouts.[^10]
7. **Stage regen carefully on 22 S builds.** Drop charge voltage a few volts or cap braking current until you validate pack and controller headroom with logs.[^11]
8. **Inspect phase filters on older duals.** Populate missing components or add external LC filters if noise, thermal, or EMI issues surface on early 75/100 hardware.[^8]
9. **Verify accessory wiring.** Keep lighting loads within the ADC bridge limits and route any kill-switch expectations through smart-BMS logic or physical loop keys.[^3]

## Procurement & Support Signals
- ExpressLine DDP shipments are clearing customs in about a week for EU buyers, yet import offices still assess duties despite the “duty paid” label.[^14]
- Regional mark-ups can double MSRP—Israeli riders now see ~$575 street pricing, pushing them toward direct factory orders or alternative brands when budgets are tight.[^14]
- Sellers occasionally under-declare controller value (e.g., listing €160 modules at €55); while it trims duties, buyers carry the audit risk if customs spot the mismatch.[^14]
- Expect warranty friction on unexplained failures—retailers are already pointing at firmware versions (e.g., 6.05) to deny coverage—so document software builds, logs, and install photos before submitting RMAs.[^19]
- Spintend’s capacitor bank remains thin for oversized QS hubs; heavy builders increasingly migrate to shunt-sensed platforms (Ennoid MK8, Tronic X12) when repeated gate-driver deaths surface.[^16]

## Failure Watchlist & Logging Habits
- Track voltage ambitions on the 85/150 carefully—units have failed at 20 S when stacked with high-Kv hubs, MTPA, and aggressive field weakening, so treat 22 S as experimental until more telemetry lands.[^36]
- Vet MOSFET swaps before chasing 200 A+: bargain JJmicro devices underperform while Huayi parts have held 20 kW loads below 40 °C, so confirm datasheets before reflowing silicon.[^37]
- Log every ride by exporting VESC Tool CSVs or bridging Android sessions to desktop so you can correlate current spikes, duty limits, and temps before relaxing guardrails.[^38]
- Inspect for contamination after heavy service—moisture ingress and solder splatter have spoofed temperature telemetry and shorted controllers even after repairs, so schedule post-ride inspections after rain or workshop work.[^39]
- Budget for QA misses: multiple 85/250s arrived DOA or died within weeks at 200 A battery / 170 A motor settings, pushing riders toward Seven or 3Shul spares while they wait on replacements.[^doa250]
- Diagnose ADC rail failures before reflashing—throttle noise can short the 3.3 V rail to ground and kill STM32 ADC inputs, so check resistance between 5 V/3.3 V and ground, then attempt MCU swaps only if you own hot-air gear and magnification.[^adc_short]

## Roadmap Signals & Known Pain Points (Aug–Oct 2022)
- **Production cadence:** Artem’s August 2022 status update confirmed 500 Spin-Y throttles were moving through hand-soldering while copper-backed singles entered onboarding—expect staggered deliveries and keep install guides handy for first-time buyers.[^2022_prod_update]
- **Traction-control heat spikes:** September test logs showed traction-control pulls heating Ubox singles faster than manual throttle launches; Artem said the next single would ship in 80 V and 100 V MOSFET flavours until the integrator board is ready, so plan cooling plates before flashing aggressive slip control.[^tc_heat]

## Late-2022 Iteration Highlights
- **Spin-Y Gen2 throttle polish.** Artem’s November updates locked in a 65° forward / 35° regen sweep, longer cabling, batch‑1 retrofit discounts, and a 1 mm magnet spacer that recovers two-thirds of the dead zone. Follow-on prototypes trialled wider diamond-cut wheels with glove-friendly textures, plus a single-magnet Spin-Y2 profile that flattens the output curve while Spintend recruits more QA coverage for the ramp-up.[^spin_y_gen2]
- **Control cluster & accessory planning.** The same push yielded a five-position thumb switch for blinkers, horn, and lighting along with reminders that Spintend’s light cluster *sources* 12 V—drive external relays instead of hanging accessories directly on the harness.[^spin_y_controls]
- **Aluminum-core Ubox roadmap.** Artem confirmed 6- and 12-FET aluminum singles are in flight with thicker copper, SH8/6 AWG support, and firmware-locked tiers that hold phase near 200–300 A and battery near 150 A until cooling is proven.[^aluminum_roadmap]
- **Single Ubox tuning guardrails.** Community clinics continue to steer 75 V singles toward ~130 A phase / 50–60 A battery, motor NTC retrofits, and bare-metal deck contact (scrape the paint) before chasing S/M/L tier upgrades or 200–350 A 6‑FET targets.[^single_tuning]
- **QC watchlist.** Fresh singles still arrive with missing screws or solder balls; pair the teardown with an ANT standby-draw check (a few tenths of a volt overnight is normal when the latching key is wired correctly) and document any power-board swaps before warranty claims.[^spintend_qc_nov]
- **Traction-control caution.** Rosheee’s rear Tronic fire after a traction-control slip renewed guidance to dial phase/battery limits and prefer front-only slip control when experimenting on Spintend duals.[^tc_failure]
- **ADC accessory budget.** Builders toasted the ADC adapter by adding 12 V fans to the board; treat it as a signal bridge and keep heavier loads on dedicated converters.[^adc_overload]
- **Diagnostics & rescue.** Mirono mapped the single’s unpopulated SWD pads to STM32 pins 46/49 and reminded rescuers to clean flux before micro-soldering, while SmartDisplay testers layered Waze alerts over Spintend CAN data for richer nav dashboards.[^stlink_waze]

[^heatsink_shift]: Yamal confirmed the refreshed 85/240 chassis moved its mounting pattern, requiring him to re-drill an older 85/250 heatsink to stack the controllers together.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L63-L63】
[^45]: Standby draw measurements and LED behaviour on Spintend’s latching power switch.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L214-L216】
[^46]: Community flashing workflow relying on Spintend-supplied BINs and auto-detection to avoid bricking controllers.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L632-L633】
[^47]: Auto-detect anomalies recommending ~270 A on dual-phase hubs until limits are manually corrected.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L824-L825】
[^single-proto]: Paolo’s single-board Spintend prototype measures ~60 mm wide without the case, adds capacitance over a Nucular 12F, should manage ≈150 A battery on flat roads, and still needs external sealing for wet decks.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L80-L82】
[^single-can]: Koxx confirmed the single Ubox exposes CAN, Bluetooth, and USB simultaneously, letting accessories and diagnostics stay online without swapping cables.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L99-L99】
[^48]: Ubox V1 vs. V2 motor detection variances demanding manual review of current limits.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L889-L889】
[^49]: Bench-testing guidance to disable regen and field weakening on PSU-powered Spintend setups to avoid over-voltage damage.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L84-L84】
[^50]: Fault logging workflow for ABS overcurrent and sensorless diagnostics before power-cycling, plus recommended CSV logging methods.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L138-L150】
[^52]: Water-cooled 85250 performance data, tariff-driven price creep, and the teased €180 18-FET revision.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L20-L20】
[^53]: Spintend X12 accessory rail limits and the need for external buck converters to power lighting or telemetry hardware.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L140-L143】
[^54]: The phase-filter toggle should be used only during motor detection; leaving it active while riding reintroduces noise and ABS overcurrent errors.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L31-L31】
[^bridge_mirror]: Spintend’s bridge keeps battery current mirrored across controllers—Smart Repair’s GT1 logs showed the front 150 A unit inheriting the rear controller’s battery amps until CAN or power was isolated.[【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L79-L79】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L317-L317】
[^baseplate_spreader]: JPPL and Shlomozero are reusing dead 75/200 baseplates as auxiliary heatsinks with aluminum spacers and radiator blocks tied into Dualtron side plates to cool HY-equipped stages.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L521-L521】
[^qc_input004]: Quality control failures on UBOX Single 100/100 batch showing shorted current-sense op-amps and blown input capacitors.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L15-L15】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L88-L88】
[^bt_polarity]: Ubox 80 V single shipped with reversed Bluetooth harness, killing the module on power-up.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L287-L287】
[^autooff-issue]: Spintend 100/100 refusing to shut down despite disabled ADC auto-off timers, indicating accessory power bleed or stuck logic rails.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L464-L464】
[^lite-connector]: Spintend Alu Lite logic harness using undocumented keyed multi-pin connectors that must be reused or sourced for custom wiring.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L777-L780】
