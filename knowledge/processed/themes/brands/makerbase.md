# Makerbase Controllers Brand Dossier

## TL;DR
- Aluminum-PCB 75100 boards remain the go-to budget dual-controller option for 60 V commuters, but they only stay reliable when capped around 70 A battery / 170–180 A phase and kept below ≈22 S; bumping currents higher has popped freshly installed units in a single launch. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L201-L205】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L219-L219】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L226-L229】
- Community veterans still warn that Makerbase boxes ship with stray solder, weak DC/DC rails, and inconsistent shunt calibration—treat every unit as a kit: open it, add proper heatsinking, and plan fallbacks to 3Shul or Spintend hardware if you need more than ≈50 A battery per controller. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L17-L19】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L18-L19】
- The 84100 HP revision adds Bluetooth, thicker leads, and a higher-voltage stack, yet it still expects a normally-closed ignition switch and proves happiest near 60–80 A battery / 150–180 A phase with regen kept under ~84 V; plan the 1 MΩ ignition mod and keep thermal logs if you stretch toward triple-digit speeds. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L15-L15】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L45-L46】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L14-L14】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L43-L45】
- MKSESC 75100 batches arrive dry, using Magnachip MDP10N027 MOSFETs, EG3112 gate drivers, and a bargain buck converter—builders now budget immediate TIM rework, spare driver/FET stock, and external antispark or manual ignition hardware because the board lacks a low-current enable lead. [^mksec_qc]
- Recent field reports show the 84xxx HP family surviving 22 S testing and sustained high current so long as phase insulation, BMS behavior, and chassis grounding are squared away—most catastrophic failures traced back to shorts, not silicon. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L18-L19】

## Product Line Cheat Sheet
| Model | Practical Pack Window | Working Envelope & Use Case | Notable Traits & Caveats |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 75100 (Alu PCB) | 48–84 V (≤22 S with regen trimmed) | ≈60–70 A battery, 160–180 A phase once clamped to metal; budget dual-motor CAN builds for G30/Vsett frames | Requires CAN linking for duals, disable regen above ~22 S, inspect firmware headers (often mislabeled as HW75300), and expect duty ripple if firmware/tool versions drift. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L201-L205】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L219-L229】 |
| 75200 V2 | 16–22 S (marketing up to 24 S) | ≈90–110 A battery combined in dual installs when cooled; suits mid-power scooters needing native key input | Roughly 130 × 68 × 28 mm with onboard shutdown lead; still needs heatsink trimming in tight decks and thorough thermal paste refresh. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L399-L400】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L25-L25】 |
| 60100 HP | ≤15 S commuters | ≤50 A battery on single-motor city builds; reliable regen on Navee/Ninebot conversions | Retains OEM dashboards with rewiring, but voltage headroom and 60 V component ratings limit regen spikes—size packs accordingly. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L19-L19】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L194-L195】 |
| 84100 HP | 60–84 V (≤20 S recommended) | ≈60–80 A battery, 150–180 A phase for Zero/Nami dual builds; higher only with extensive cooling and telemetry | Ships with NC ignition logic, integrated Bluetooth, sacrificial 0 Ω links, and benefits from the 1 MΩ pull-down mod plus active thermal management before chasing 100 km/h logs. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L45-L46】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L168-L168】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L43-L44】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L15-L15】 |

## Voltage, Current & Regen Guardrails
- Keep regen ceilings conservative on 22 S packs: riders log 75100 and 84100 boards failing when negative current stacks back-EMF above ~84 V, so either disable e-brake or cap battery regen under −10 A on high-voltage builds. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L14-L14】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L152-L152】
- BMS settings are not a safety net—slow-trip Daly boards still let surges vaporize Makerbase gate drivers. Shorten trip delays and log every cutoff instead of assuming rated limits will save a fault. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L361-L363】
- Firmware reports battery current plus field-weakening draw; budget 10 A of FW as additional pack load so commuter cells stay within safe C-rates. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L227-L227】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L208-L208】
- Treat 23 S marketing with skepticism—community testers still cap Makerbase hardware at ≤20–22 S even on the 84100 because component tolerances and regen spikes remain the primary failure points. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L113-L113】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L106-L106】
- Verified 22 S survivors all shared meticulous harness audits—phase shorts to the chassis, not voltage itself, killed the lone documented 84200 HP board—so bake insulation checks and BMS regression tests into every high-voltage install. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L18-L19】

## Reliability & Incoming Inspection
- Open every new board: veterans keep finding loose capacitors, missing thermal paste, and even epoxy jumpers on fresh shipments; reglue caps and retorque hardware before install. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L229-L229】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L434-L434】
- Add bulk capacitance to the 12 V (and where accessible, 5 V/3.3 V) rails—the retrofit prevents infamous brownouts when BMSs trip or accessories spike load, especially on resin-potted boards. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L448-L451】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L510-L510】
- Insulate the logic and Bluetooth stack with Kapton or similar dielectric film; one 75100 nearly lost its 3.3 V rail to static discharge until the owner lined the enclosure, underscoring how fragile the low-voltage supply remains.[^kapton_static]
- Document MOSFET and driver replacements: hot-plug failures often kill only part of a parallel set, so replace all devices on that leg and confirm 12 V/5 V rails before reassembly. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L303-L303】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L363-L363】
- Verify shunt calibration with clamp meters or smart-BMS telemetry; many 75100s deliver only half the programmed battery amps until you correct the scaling. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L75-L76】
- Bench-test at both low and full pack voltage before installation—one 75 100 that happily booted on 3 S refused to wake on 13–16 S even after reflashing, pointing to high-voltage hardware faults that warrant an immediate RMA instead of more firmware experiments. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L82-L83】
- Skip hard potting unless you accept throwaway repairs—silicone (e.g., 705 RTV) still lets you service ADC pins, add capacitors, or reflash firmware, whereas epoxy-sealed 75100s trap the MCU and driver rails under resin and make ignition or capacitor fixes nearly impossible. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L429-L429】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L582-L584】
- Builders chasing splash protection now CAD PLA+/PETG housings and jet-duct side pods for Xiaomi deck installs, sealing seams with silicone or dielectric epoxy so aluminum-PCB 75100s survive rain without suffocating their heatsinks.[^printed_housings]

## Setup & Commissioning Checklist
1. **Flash matching firmware/tool pairs.** Makerbase boards frequently ship misidentified (e.g., reporting as HW75300); desktop VESC Tool flashing plus phase-filter disable after detection stabilizes idle behavior. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L204-L204】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L159-L159】
2. **Finish calibration on desktop VESC Tool.** The Android wizard hides throttle/brake channel mapping, so owners swap TX/RX leads or re-enable Bluetooth in VESC Tool, save configs, and flash Izuna’s calibrated firmware once the hardware ID mismatch prompt is cleared. 【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part002.txt†L26222-L27368】
3. **Inspect ignition logic before wiring switches.** 75100 units expect a momentary latch—bridge 5 V to the AD15 enable pin for roughly a second to turn on (three seconds to shut down) and set the ADC shutdown timer so the controller actually unlatches—while 84100HP controllers need a normally-closed switch or the documented 1 MΩ pull-down to mimic Ubox-style keys. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L699-L702】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L525-L526】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L45-L45】
4. **Leverage the 75200 VCC selector when pairing smart BMS keys.** The latest boards ship with a 3.3 V/5 V selector and SW pins that tie directly into LLT key outputs, letting the BMS precharge and toggle the controller daily without rewiring harness power—enable the controller’s DC/DC control mode when reusing OEM switches. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L15801-L15835】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L15969-L15973】
5. **Log both controllers on CAN.** Always `Read` active configs before writing; mismatched IDs or version drift can silently overwrite both nodes during tuning. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L91-L97】
6. **Link CAN before pairing dashboards.** Makerbase dual-drive owners remind newcomers to wire CAN high/low between controllers (no shared positive) so both nodes synchronise before Bluetooth or dash pairing.[^can_first]
7. **Stage regen after thermal validation.** Start with mechanical brakes, then add modest battery regen while watching bus voltage—random 12 V rail dropouts usually trace back to aggressive negative current. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L367-L367】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L232-L232】
8. **Clamp controllers to metal with fresh paste.** Aluminum cases shed heat only when bolted to frames or external plates; cramped decks that rely on air gaps have cooked MOSFETs even at moderate logs. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L18-L18】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L272-L272】
9. **Swap observers if detection misbehaves.** MXUS/Ninebot hybrids that cog on 84100HP hardware smooth out once riders abandon Mxlemming for Ortega (no lambda) and rerun detection before re-tuning PI gains. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L125-L125】
10. **Persist configs after every tuning session.** Mobile and desktop VESC Tool builds are still wiping Makerbase settings—re-run the motor wizard when needed, then explicitly `Write Motor Config` and `Write App Config`, and keep the bootloader handy for corrupted saves to stop ABS_overcurrent faults from returning after a reboot. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L404-L408】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L408-L418】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L573-L573】

## Wiring & Accessory Integration
- Power throttles from the 3.3 V rail and use resistor dividers for 5 V hall inputs; direct 5 V feeds have already killed STM32 ADC stages on Makerbase boards. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L202-L202】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L251-L251】
- Makerbase harness accessory headers use JST-GH 1.27 mm pitch—plan pigtails accordingly when integrating dashboards or brake sensors. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L328-L328】
- Pair ADC adapters or dashboards with external relays if you need a real kill switch; the ADC lighting bridge only sources a few amps and cannot isolate the battery. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L459-L461】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L498-L498】
- Keep horn/lighting loads small on the ADC harness—the Makerbase/Spintend “horn” pin sources only a couple of amps, so 35 W halogens belong on a dedicated DC/DC rail with the controller output simply driving a relay.[^adc_load]
- For binary accessories or mower-style implements, bridge the throttle shunt’s red/white leads with ~10 kΩ or configure the ADC app with a pulldown so a normally-open switch maps cleanly between 0 % and 100 % duty.[^binary_accessory]
- The ADC Adapter V3 breakout keeps ignition, lighting, and accessory rails tidy—feed the board from the Makerbase controller, map ADC channel 9 to “control,” and let the adapter provide fused taps instead of back-powering through the BMS.[^adc_adapter]
- For NC ignition builds on the 84100HP, document the 1 MΩ pull-down and confirm the switch actually opens the STM32 input—builders have destroyed keys by wiring normally-open hardware without the mod. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L45-L45】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L167-L167】

## When to Choose Alternatives
- Projects demanding sustained ≥90 A battery or >200 A phase per motor should step up to Spintend 85/250, Tronic, or 3Shul hardware—pushing Makerbase past those envelopes repeatedly ends in MOSFET or gate-driver failures. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L19-L19】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L24-L24】
- Riders unwilling to rework QC issues (thermal paste, capacitor staking, ignition mods) or lacking access to repair tooling should default to Ubox or 3Shul platforms with stronger support ecosystems. 【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L17-L19】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L487-L487】
- Budget builds that cannot stomach downtime still migrate to Spintend, Tronic, or Seven controllers—community veterans treat Makerbase 84xxx boards as consumables when chasing 300 A-class logs or waiting on higher-spec revisions.[^alt_consumable]
