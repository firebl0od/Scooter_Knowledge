## Price-to-Performance Debate

### The Question

At ~‚Ç¨530 for the Duet bundle, early adopters are asking:[^1]
- Does official hardware justify the premium?
- How does it compare to Chinese imports?
- Is the current headroom worth the cost?

### What Needs Validation

**Community Priorities**:[^1][^5]
1. Detailed teardowns with photos
2. Capacitor stack documentation
3. MOSFET part number verification
4. MCU resource confirmation
5. Real-world thermal testing
6. Performance data vs. competitors

> **üìù Note**: Launch marketing needs field validation. Community is actively testing to verify claims.

### Competitive Context

**Alternatives Being Compared**:[^1]
- Tronic controllers
- Spintend high-voltage options
- FarDriver for raw current capability
- Seven 18 (similar specs, different pricing)

## Field Testing Priorities

### Documentation Requirements

**For Every Installation**:[^2][^5]
- [ ] Photograph capacitor bay airflow paths
- [ ] Document thermal interface choices
- [ ] Note MOSFET part numbers
- [ ] Capture MCU identifiers
- [ ] Log vented design performance in enclosed decks

### Thermal Validation

**First Ride Testing**:[^2]
1. Monitor temperatures closely
2. Verify vented design effectiveness
3. Compare to alternatives if available
4. Document thermal throttling behavior
5. Test in enclosed deck installations

### CAN Integration Testing

**Interoperability Checks**:[^4][^6]
- Test with VESC Express modules
- Try third-party telemetry
- Verify reliable handshaking
- Compare to Seven 18 experiences (needed separate modules)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Learning from Seven 18**: Early units needed separate Express modules for telemetry. Validate Maxim interoperability before deployment.

### Performance Logging

**Critical Data to Capture**:[^3]
- Duty cycle behavior
- Phase current actuals vs. commanded
- Battery sag under load
- Thermal performance
- Comparison with FarDriver (for Minim users)

## Firmware & Software

### VESC Tool Compatibility

**Known Issues**:[^tooling]
- VESC Tool 6.06 Android temporarily broke Bluetooth pairing
- Fixed in 6.06.4
- Desktop flashing recommended for new hardware
- Document software builds with telemetry

**Best Practice**:
- Test firmware before field deployment
- Keep backup of working versions
- Plan desktop flashes initially
- Join community for compatibility updates

### Open Source Compliance

**Important Consideration**:[^licensing]
- VESC firmware is GPL-licensed
- Seven 18 shipped without source code
- Press vendors to publish `.c/.h` files
- Community expects GPL compliance

**Why This Matters**:
- Enables modifications and fixes
- Supports community development
- Legal requirement under GPL
- Critical for long-term support

### VESC Express Boards

**Power Requirements**:[^express_logging]
- Needs external buck converter for 5V supply
- Only draws 5V / 150mA from Spintend rails
- Clean logging on 6.05
- 6.06 restarts every 3 seconds (firmware issue)

**Workarounds**:
- Use separate CAN modules if needed
- Budget for external power supplies
- Test thoroughly before deployment

## Comparison: Minim vs. FarDriver

### Decision Factors

**Minim 100V Advantages**:[^3]
- Tidy harnessing
- VESC firmware features
- Better integration
- ~180A phase / ~35A battery
