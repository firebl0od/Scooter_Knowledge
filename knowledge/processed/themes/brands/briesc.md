# Briesc Controller Snapshot

## TL;DR
- Italian-built single Briesc controllers are already holding 150 A battery / 350 A phase on bench-tested builds without heatsinks, logging roughly 55 °C case temps at those loads—proof the compact package has real headroom once airflow is planned.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L346-L349】
- The platform ships without integrated Bluetooth, so budget an external dongle or SmartDisplay pass-through even though the controller hardware can sit in tight decks that previously relied on Makerbase 75100-class gear.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L346-L349】

## Field Notes
- Riders flashing Vedder firmware onto ultra-small BLE boards found the range unusable; pair Briesc installs with the proven €2 modules or SmartDisplay bridges until an official wireless option ships.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L346-L347】
