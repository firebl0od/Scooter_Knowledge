# Rion Performance Scooters Brand Dossier

## TL;DR

- RE90 buyers should budget well above the sticker: VAT, customs, and freight push the $6 800 base toward roughly €7 500 even before spares, which makes Paris pickup runs or hand-carrying attractive to avoid repeat taxes.[^1]
- Marketing claims of 400 A phase output and 136 PS motors remain unverified; community consensus is that the 23 S 6 P (~3 kWh) battery is the true bottleneck, so treat stock performance promises as aspirational until logs prove otherwise.[^1][^2]
- The latest Leo Apex/Rion production still leans on LY 60 H 22/3 hubs with 4 mm phase leads, keeping verified top speed near 123 km/h on 24 S and limiting safe motor current to roughly 180–200 A despite premium Tronic X12 controllers and >€9 k pricing.[^4]
- High-KV Rion-spec hubs demand controllers that can really supply ≥250 A phase and thicker-than-stock looms—4 mm² wiring overheats quickly, so Kelly/Sabvoton-class stages and 9.5 AWG leads are now the practical baseline.[^5][^6]
- RX-series carbon frames were styled for lighter builds; once riders chase 400 A tunes they report noticeable flex and still need to add waterproofing, torque arms, and tyre upgrades before all-season duty.[^2][^7]
- The carbon chassis ships with minimal weather sealing—expect to add waterproofing and consider dry-weather slicks, because the platform is tuned for peak tarmac performance rather than all-season utility.[^2]
- Rebranded Leo Apex/Rion batches still ride on LY 60 H 22/3 hubs with 4 mm phase leads, so top speed stalls around 123 km/h on 24 S and phase current needs to stay near 180–200 A despite the Tronic X12 controllers; even at >€9 000 landed, riders still swap out the stock Nutt brakes.[^4][^5]
- Replacement Rion/Weped FF-spec motors can be sourced around €340 in France, but rising freight often erases the deal for overseas owners; plan group shipments or forwarding to keep landed cost sane.[^3]
- 24 S conversions with Tronic controllers deliver brutal launches but still overwhelm front-wheel traction near 120 km/h unless phase current and ramping stay conservative.[^4]
- Leo Apex rebrands keep the LY 60 H 22/3 hubs with 4 mm phase leads, so practical phase ceilings remain about 180–200 A even with Tronic X12 controllers, and pricing now stretches beyond €9 000 while retaining mid-tier brakes.[^5]

## Platform Snapshot

| Focus | Stock Insight | Operational Implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Battery & power | 23 S 6 P pack (~3 kWh) underpins stock builds; limited headroom makes the battery, not controllers, the first limit you will hit.[^2] | Prioritise cell health monitoring and plan future pack upgrades before chasing more aggressive controller tunes. |
| Chassis | Carbon construction is lauded for stiffness and weight, but there is virtually no OEM waterproofing.[^2] | Invest early in sealing seams, cable glands, and connector boots if the scooter will ever see wet conditions. |
| Motor & controller pairing | LY 60 H 22/3 hubs with 4 mm leads cap reliable phase current near 180–200 A and flatten acceleration beyond ~123 km/h even on 24 S Tronic X12 builds.[^4] | Budget for rewinds or higher-spec hubs if you plan to push beyond stock top-speed targets, and monitor lead temperatures during extended pulls. |
| Cost of entry | Import math shows €7 500 landed cost once VAT/customs/shipping are included.[^1] | Price in protective gear, spares, and a contingency fund—repairs and customs rework can rival the base scooter price. |
| Motor envelope | Production Leo Apex/Rion builds still ship 60 H 22/3 hubs with 4 mm leads, keeping safe current near 200 A and real-world speed around 123 km/h on 24 S.[^4] | Budget for higher-spec hubs or rewinds if you need more torque or speed, and temper expectations until the battery/controller stack is refreshed. |
| Drivetrain service | FF-spec motors are available via specialist contacts at ≈€340 each, yet international freight can double that figure.[^3] | Consolidate orders or partner with EU-based buyers to minimise per-motor logistics overhead. |

## Strengths to Leverage

- **Hill-climb capability:** Riders seeking alpine routes value the RE90’s power-to-weight ratio once the battery is healthy and thermal logging is in place.[^1]
- **Aero-friendly packaging:** Carbon panels and clean wiring make it a top candidate for high-speed tarmac builds with minimal drag add-ons.[^2]
- **Controller headroom (with the right motors):** Compact Tronic X12 stacks shine when paired with hubs that can absorb the current—swap the OEM 60 H cans for 70 mm magnet sets if you want to exploit their potential.[^4][^6]

## Reliability Watchlist

- **Battery truth gap:** Until you have telemetry confirming sustained current delivery, assume marketing numbers overstate real capability.[^1]
- **Weather exposure:** Stock seals are insufficient; moisture ingress will jeopardise both the carbon structure and high-voltage electronics if left untreated.[^2]
- **Chassis flex:** RX carbon frames feel “chewing gum” at 400 A—plan dampers, reinforcement plates, and tyre upgrades if you chase high-speed stability.[^7]
- **Handling opinions diverge:** Paolo praises RX2000 stability without a damper near 100 km/h, but Face de Pin Sucé still calls the chassis twitchy versus Weped builds—log your own high-speed telemetry before trimming safety margins.[^1]
- **Track-day feedback is harsh:** Angerville kart racers cited brake fade, frame flex, and high centres of gravity that made Rions sketchy on tight circuits; their workaround mixes dual throttles, external controller mounts, ferrofluid-cooled Vsett motors, and upgraded Magura brakes.[^2]
- **Motor bottlenecks:** The LY-manufactured hubs remain the limiting factor—pushing phase current past ≈200 A or ignoring lead temperatures risks overheating long before the controllers run out of headroom.[^4]
- **Logistics churn:** Replacement motors are attainable but shipping shocks can nullify savings—budget for customs fees or arrange local pickup.[^3]
- **Legacy chassis cracks:** Tear down older Rion frames—Face de Pin Sucé uncovered cracked steering heads, flexing plates, underspec’d Kelly controllers, and fan ducts that just slam into carbon walls until you rework airflow.[^steering_crack][^legacy_fans]

## Setup Priorities for New Owners

1. **Audit import paperwork** – confirm VAT/customs payments and document serial numbers before first ride; this simplifies future warranty or resale interactions.[^1]
2. **Waterproof the chassis** – strip panels, add gaskets or silicone seams, and protect high-voltage connectors before commuting or riding in damp climates.[^2]
3. **Baseline telemetry** – log pack voltage, current, and controller temps on stock firmware to understand real limits ahead of performance tuning.[^1][^2]
4. **Assess motor and wiring limits** – verify whether your build still runs 4 mm² phase leads; upgrade to 9.5 AWG-class harnesses and controllers capable of ≥250 A phase before targeting the advertised acceleration.[^5][^6]
5. **Plan parts logistics** – if you need spare motors or carbon panels, coordinate consolidated shipments through EU hubs to blunt freight surcharges.[^3]

## High-Voltage Tuning Guardrails

- **Traction still fails first:** 24 S packs and Tronic 250R tunes are spinning the front tyre at ~120 km/h launches, so stagger ramping, warm tyres, and prioritise damper setup before chasing higher phase numbers.[^4]
- **24 S traction reality:** Even Jesús’ 100 V Tronic 250R build still spins the front wheel near 120 km/h; keep phase ceilings moderate and pair upgrades with serious traction prep before layering on more field weakening.[^24s_traction]
- **Respect hub lead limits:** Production Rions and the Leo Apex share LY 60 H 22/3 motors with 4 mm phase conductors; riders cap them around 180–200 A continuous despite controller headroom, reserving higher numbers for short dyno pulls only.[^5]
- **Ease off when faults return:** Over-cranking phase current and heavy field-weakening brought grinding noises and cut-outs back on Jesús’s 24 S tune—dial limits back toward the 200 A region and verify traction-control settings before the next test run.[^4]
- **Finish diagnostics after repairs:** Swapping MOSFETs alone didn’t save Rosheee’s controller; latent shorts blew the VESC on the next motor detection, so meter the power stage and gate drivers before reconnecting the pack.[^6]

## Upgrade & Maintenance Roadmap

- **Battery-first tuning:** Focus on validating cell balance and temperature spread; pursue pack upgrades or parallel modules before increasing controller current limits.[^2]
- **Motor swaps & spacing:** “Rion 1337” 70 mm magnet hubs ship with ~155–160 mm axles, 33 Kv windings, and ~9.5 AWG phase leads—too wide for Monorim or VSETT forks without custom plates, but they drop into Zero 11X-scale swingarms once you budget torque arms and ferrofluid cooling.[^3][^6][^8]
- **Controller pairing:** High-KV hubs routinely cook 75/200-class VESCs; stepping up to Kelly, Sabvoton, or dual Tronic hardware keeps ≥250 A phase targets realistic without sensorless stalls.[^5]
- **Controller mix:** BAC 4000 twins only appeared on the Thrust prototype; production scooters stayed on Tronic stacks with the BACs simply sharing a throttle signal, so plan wiring and expectations accordingly if you chase non-Tronic swaps.[^bac_pairing]
- **Throttle ergonomics:** The pricey CNC thumbwheel is still a basic hall sensor—builders cloning it with Spintend Spinny or Davega hardware report similar feel once wiring is sorted, and Spintend is now prototyping a “curve” thumbwheel to mirror the dual-action control without the premium casing.[^throttle_clone][^curve_thumb]
- **Tyre & brake strategy:** Evaluate slicks or semi-slicks that match the platform’s dry-focus geometry, but keep a wet-weather set and mechanical braking upgrades ready because regen-only setups still falter when BMS charge FETs open.[^2][^9]
- **Plan future controller swaps:** Some owners are holding firmware experiments until they pair 3Shul 700/1400 controllers with Lonnyo 100 H hubs and 50PL packs, underscoring how major driveline overhauls reshape the Rion upgrade path.[^future_swap]
- **Service kit:** Stock carbon-safe cleaners, torque-limited tools, spare hall boards, and corrosion inhibitors to maintain the frame after weather sealing efforts.[^2][^5]

## Market & Procurement Signals

- Leo Apex pricing now clears €9 000 while still shipping with Nutt brakes; factor in the premium for branding when comparing against custom Rion builds or competing factory frames.[^5]
- French kart tracks host regular scooter days for roughly €25–35, while Swiss riders are still negotiating local access—context for planning shakedown trips or track testing.[^4]
- Fresh inventory sightings include 100 V Tronic X12 controllers and 33×2 60 H motors with 125 mm dropouts and 4 mm banana leads around €300 delivered inside the EU, giving owners a benchmark for sourcing spares without paying Rion’s full markup.[^10]
