# VSETT Performance Scooter Dossier

## TL;DR
- VSETT 10+ frames remain one of the stiffest production stems—only two rear shock mount failures were logged before the factory revision—and relocating controllers to the neck frees the deck for 20 S 9 P 21700 packs without compromising rigidity.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L25-L25】
- The 92 mm stator VSETT 9 motor (15 pole pairs, 0.5 mm air gap) hits the sweet spot for 10-inch comfort and is still sourced around €120 inside the EU, making it a go-to upgrade hub.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L42-L42】
- Artem’s field logs keep PMT 10×3 at the top of the tire list (≈48 psi target) with CST 10×3 as the budget runner-up; expect egg-shaped carcasses on narrow rims but manageable ride quality.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L55-L57】
- Split rims simplify roadside service—each half separates once the axle nuts are off—so keep spare halves, bearings, and stators handy for pothole-induced wobble hunts.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L60-L62】
- Matris dampers paired with PMT tires and EXA shocks deliver rock-solid steering, but beware clones from FalconPEV/AliExpress/Amazon; genuine units run ~€250 and require inspection before trust.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L68-L70】
- Launch torque hinges on tuned current ramps and PID gains—community recipes (FOC redetection, 20 kHz switching, hall interpolation, unchecked current limits) recovered punch while trimming ~100 A from full-throttle pulls once logs validated the new curves.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L6990-L7058】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L7003-L7028】
- Stock 140 mm rotors fade quickly on high-power builds; 160 mm SRAM Cleansweep or Magura MDR-P discs plus proper banjo hardware transform braking torque and heat rejection for dual-motor commuters.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L8211-L8253】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L9522-L9538】
- Factory 9+/10+ and Kugoo G4 packs are paired right at their controller ceilings; riders log severe sag, speed loss, and wobble complaints until higher-discharge packs replace the stock modules.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L101-L101】

## Platform Notes
### Frame & Packaging
- Neck-mounted controller relocations open enough deck volume for 20 S 9 P 21700 packs while maintaining stem stiffness, giving commuters long-range options without external battery boxes.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L25-L25】
- Rental-grade Xiaomi conversions borrowing VSETT hardware add roughly 10 kg with thick stems and oversized fork hardware; expect a sturdier but less portable chassis once dual brakes and battery bays are reinforced.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L64-L64】
- Artem is confident the Vsett 9 chassis swallows 52 V 30 Ah packs—and even vertical 20 S 8 P trays with spacers—for ~160 km range while keeping everything internal, so plan wiring harnesses with the extra volume in mind.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L10118-L10132】

### Motor & Wheel Options
- Stock VSETT 9 hubs feature 92 mm stators, 15 pole pairs, and a tight 0.5 mm air gap—pair them with the taller 10-inch carcass to smooth harsh pavement while keeping torque respectable.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L42-L42】
- Artem now pegs the Vsett 9 hub around 48 km/h on 52 V (≈58 km/h dual) and says the 10+ wheel needs 60 V to shine; expect muted top speed on 48 V despite its ~130 A/50 A thermal headroom and 1 400 W nominal rating.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L352-L352】
- Ignore marketing wattage on Vsett 10+ motors—inspect winding fill and magnet stack height before pushing phase amps or buying donor wheels for AWD conversions.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L440-L443】
- Recent teardowns logged 9×7 slot/pole counts, 0.5 mm laminations, and RUWH 6003RS bearings; blank front covers from Vsett 9 rentals can disguise dual-motor conversions by hiding the second hub’s wattage rating during inspections.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L387-L388】
- Vsett 9+/10+ hubs comfortably burst near 5 kW when temperature sensors track sustained loads, so treat the “600 W” label as commuter-only marketing and log temps before upping duty cycles.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L69-L69】
- Stock hub hardware has already endured serious power—the community logged 10–12 kW pushes on OEM motors before Nucular 12F limits intervened—so thermal headroom comes from cooling and harness upgrades rather than immediate motor swaps.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L314-L314】
- Split rims allow tire swaps without disconnecting harnesses, but install 6 mm bullets on phases plus 6-pin Higo/Julet blocks for halls and thermistors to simplify maintenance.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L59-L63】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L73-L74】
- Split rims allow tire swaps without disconnecting harnesses, but install 6 mm bullets on phases plus 6-pin Higo/Julet blocks for halls and thermistors to simplify maintenance.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L59-L62】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L73-L74】
- Kaabo-sourced hubs vary: square-wave throttle kits often ship hall-less while sine-wave GT packages include sensors—verify before planning regen-heavy controller swaps.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L74-L74】
- Bench jigs that see ≈28 mΩ across two phases (≈14 mΩ per phase) flag healthy Blade/VSETT hubs—use the fixture for repeatable QC before buttoning up builds and still rerun VESC detection to capture in-ride inductance shifts.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L24566-L24578】
- VSETT 10 motors share the 50 mm stator Laotie uses; they bolt straight into G30 swingarms but still lack a tubeless 10″ option, pushing commuters toward heavier 11″ conversions when they want fatter rubber.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L316-L316】
- Swapping Zero 10X hubs into Vsett frames changes the ride entirely—the Zero windings run lower kV for torque while Vsett sticks with higher-kV speed winds, so budget gearing and controller tweaks if you trade between the platforms despite the shared axle width.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L317-L317】
- “SHDC” castings show up across Kaabo/Nanrobot supply chains and will add hall sensors on request; Wolf GT owners confirm newer sine-wave motors arrive with halls while Kelly conversions retrofit them for reliable starts.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L583-L584】
- Xiaomi and VSETT hall boards aren’t interchangeable—the Vsett 10+ rotor spacing keeps Xiaomi controllers from running the hub smoothly even after sensor swaps, so plan controller changes instead of chasing hall geometry fixes.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part004.txt†L7238-L7258】
- HM and Blade “limited edition” hubs share the ~135 mm axle spacing, so they drop straight into VSETT 10/G30 swingarms once spacers are trimmed; SibClimb and Paolo’s EU storefronts are the go-to sources when you need the higher-torque windings.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L25331-L25337】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L5520-L5631】
- HM-branded hubs demand ≥50 A battery to feel lively yet run noticeably hotter than comparable LY winds, so high-power conversions with identical fork spacing keep favouring the lower-KV LY motors for better thermal margin.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L43-L43】
- Budget dual-motor swaps are back on the menu: Paolo is selling Blade hubs for about €200 each (≈€520 with PMT slicks) and even offering shipping tricks—declare warranty parts and skip UPS, which has lost multiple high-value parcels.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L26005-L26103】
- Paolo’s 60 mm magnet Blade hubs are already holding 85 A battery on 16 S and targeting 20 S tests; expect to lean on ferrofluid and active cooling before chasing higher voltage because the same motor survived 130 A battery/350 A phase only after aggressive thermal prep.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L11407-L11433】
- Factory star-point solder still needs QA—torch off lacquer, brush clean, and reflow the joints before re-running motor detection to cut resistance and heat on refurbished VSETT stators.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L23963-L24010】
- Inspect “new” OEM hubs before installation—one VSETT motor shipped rusty with loose magnets, and the community now strips corrosion and bonds magnets back with Loctite AA326 before reuse.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part004.txt†L2133-L2152】
- Fresh 60 mm VSETT hubs respond well to ferrofluid fills and careful clamping; riders are comfortable around ~50 A battery and 100 A phase once the stator is rewrapped and torqued correctly.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part004.txt†L3001-L3015】
- High-torque 11-inch hubs start shedding magnets when hammered with sustained 200 A+ phase current—dial back current or expect heat-driven failures on VSETT conversions pushing that envelope.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part004.txt†L2695-L2706】

### Tire, Pressure & Maintenance Guidance
- Run PMT 10×3 near 48 psi for grip; CST 10×3 tubeless remains the cost-effective choice but bulges into an egg on narrow rims. Stock CST beads run small—seat them carefully to avoid wobble.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L55-L57】
- PMT casings are tubeless-ready yet tolerate inner tubes (CST 10×2.5 pairing works); the stiff carcass can even limp home deflated for short distances, which is handy for roadside repairs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L59-L61】
- Keep spare split-rim halves and bearings—pothole hits can ovalize the shells, so swap components methodically until vibration disappears, documenting tire experiments to isolate causes.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L60-L62】
- Track pressures by rider weight: PMT slicks stay happy near 2.4 bar, Vsett racers run ~3.5 bar, and dropping to 1.8 bar shreds cords while 4.2 bar CST setups lose grip—log PSI alongside rider mass when comparing setups.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L111-L111】
- CST 10×2.5 inner tubes have proven durable across months of mixed on/off-road use and are thick enough for 10×3 tires, but 20 S setups still shred them quickly if pressures stay low—log PSI after hard rides.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part004.txt†L2640-L2656】

### Steering & Stability Hardware
- **Inspect 10-series steering columns for thin-wall cracks.** Photos show the lower weld splitting along the slender extrusion, so retrofit thicker Warrior stems or add machined sleeves before cranking up power levels.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L16-L16】
- Triangulated neck brackets tying Matris dampers into PMT tires and EXA shocks eliminate wobble on VSETT 10 builds; ensure at least three anchor points instead of relying on the flex-prone stock tab.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L68-L68】
- Genuine Matris dampers ship around €250 and need inspection—budget clones from FalconPEV, AliExpress, or Amazon masquerade as Matris/Öhlins but lack consistent internals.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L69-L69】
- Reserve dampers for robust frames—Monorim-equipped Xiaomi forks remain only ~4 mm thick, making 90 km/h runs suicidal without serious reinforcement.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L70-L70】

### Performance & Telemetry Benchmarks
- Fresh Dragy runs clocked a VSETT 10 at 0–60 km/h in roughly 4.75 s and 0–80 km/h in 7.5 s using 78 A/200 A rear and 70 A/130 A front profiles (~148 A battery combined, 196 A rear phase); even with motors staying near 130 °F, riders flagged chassis control as the new limiting factor at those tune levels.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L27655-L27667】
- Ubox speed readings stay honest only after setting 15 pole pairs (instead of 30 poles) and shrinking wheel diameter to ~210 mm for tire squish; skipping the tweak leaves the dash stuck near 28 km/h on 60 V packs even when the scooter is really doing ~55 km/h.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L524-L525】
- Treat aerodynamic tweaks as meaningful range levers—commuters logged 63–65 Wh/km in calm weather that jumped to ~72 Wh/km when battling headwinds in bulky winter jackets, illustrating how rider silhouette nearly doubles energy draw even when electrical settings hold steady.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L25022-L25045】
- Field-weakening is staged carefully on dual builds: crews activate 87.5–89.5 % duty and +25 % throttle curve on the rear before bringing the front online around 93 % to avoid simultaneous current spikes while still gaining a modest 8 km/h at the cost of doubled power draw.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L24013-L24167】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L24676-L24694】
- The community’s new LT-01/QS-S4 Lisp driver mirrors UART telemetry and expects throttles to stay under 3.3 V; add resistor dividers or the dash’s safe-start logic trips and ADC rails risk over-voltage when swapping controllers.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L231-L231】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L239-L239】
- Ferrofluid (≈6 ml Statorade) keeps dual 1.4 kW hubs under ~40 °C on 16 S routes that previously hit ~63 °C, but heat shifts into the magnets—long climbs still need logging to avoid saturation.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L6340-L6362】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L6800-L6821】
- Unsealed Vsett 9 decks remain risky in sustained rain; riders either pot electronics or tear them down immediately for ingress checks if they have to commute through storms.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L397-L397】
- If a 17 S build free-spins slower than the old 16 S tune, revisit pole-pair counts and duty caps—identical VSETT motors should spin faster with more voltage, so firmware misconfiguration is the prime suspect.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L26300-L26380】
- Artem’s refreshed Vsett 9 now runs dual 650 W hubs on a 16 S 8 P Samsung 35E pack with dual Ubox controllers, SmartController integration, LED spacers, and a GPS/4G tracker—logging 0–50 km/h in 5.5 s with only 3.6 V sag at 27 A battery and 80–85 A phase per motor while highlighting rear-motor sync hiccups above ~85 A phase for diagnostics.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L714-L727】
- Tuned PID ramps paired with the community’s 1200 W wizard preset and 20 kHz switching held 90 kg riders at full throttle above 30 km/h while drawing roughly 100 A less than stock tunes, underscoring how much launch maths lives in firmware rather than brute current.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L6990-L7058】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L7003-L7028】
- Samsung 48X 20 S9 P packs are backing 10 kW bursts with only 4–7 V sag at 110–135 A and keeping 64 mph runs under ~65 °C winding temperature, so long as cell delta stays near 0.002 V after spirited rides.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L21612-L21658】

### High-Discharge Build Guardrails
- 20 S 11 P ambitions require ≥300 A of pack capability plus P42A/P45B/40T-class cells; the crew budgets roughly 250 A battery and 350–550 A phase per motor alongside 485 × 210 × 86 mm trays to unlock 20 kW-class launches without cooking the pack.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L26-L27】
- Treat “20 kg, 157 km/h, 150 km range” marketing with skepticism—just the claimed range would need ~11 kg of cells, and even NAMI motors struggle to hold 100 km/h on 20 S without rewinds and aggressive cooling toward 27–30 kW continuous output.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L26-L28】

### Launch & Field-Weakening Experiments
- Genuine field-weakening toggles remain locked to FW 5.3 firmware; owners are sideloading 300 A bins and testing duty-cycle triggers near 70 % to break through the 95–98 % plateau without roasting hubs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L7166-L7194】
- Vedder Sensorless Start hides under the sensorless encoder profile and expects motor-temperature telemetry—without it, launches fall back to noisy hall-only starts that stretch 0–30 km/h runs toward five seconds on hills.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L7351-L7415】
- Keep the OEM dash by flashing the community script or repurposing 10 kΩ NTCs between hall ground and an extra conductor so dual builds log motor temps without ditching the stock display.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L271-L271】

### Battery & Enclosure Upgrades
- Relocating controllers outside the deck opens room for a 20 S9 P Samsung 48X pack inside the 10+; builders report ~2 mm side clearance in a 169 mm jig and pair the pack with JK active-balancing BMS boards and waterproof Higo/Julet harnesses for serviceability.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L6371-L6486】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L6501-L6504】
- Community packaging logs now include 13 S 10 P Samsung 40T packs inside the 9+ deck plus parallel 20 S 6 P and 20 S 5 P MH1 add-ons (≈72 V, 32 Ah, ~100 A continuous) when space is tight—mixed chemistries demand careful harnessing and coordinated BMS balancing but keep sleeper builds rolling.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L184-L184】
- Stock Vsett 9 commuters appreciate the removable battery and hydraulic brakes yet still flag the dated 8.5″ tubes as a reliability risk in 2024—plan tire upgrades alongside pack work.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L176-L176】
- The flagship 20 S9 P build highlighted in late-2021 chats delivered 43.2 Ah and a 150 A discharge ceiling when matched with dual Nucular 12F controllers—the “most beast” deck-mounted configuration to date.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L538-L539】
- A newer 20 S9 P revision barely clears the deck once controllers move outside: builders convert the controller tails to AS150, wrap the pack in Kapton/fish paper instead of full shrink for serviceability, and set a 2.5 mm thermal pad beneath so the lid clamps the pack without chafing while wicking heat into the deck.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L623-L624】
- Harness planning matters at these pack sizes—Happy Giraffe and Koxx now run shared-ground 24–26 AWG looms or slim AliExpress harnesses for throttle/brake/start lines so the wiring clears the tight passthroughs without resorting to stiff Ethernet cables.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L6481-L6504】
- Artem’s copper-clad 20 S 9 P build uses pre-welded laser-cut tabs, QS8 anti-spark connectors, and copper bus reinforcements (~$170 shipped) to fit a 168 mm-wide “W” pack inside the 171 mm deck once controllers move outside; 19 mm PVC plus 5 mm acrylic risers lift the lid for a top-mounted BMS.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L8851-L8913】
- Protect every cell: wrap 21700s in heat-shrink and Kapton, slide wax/fish-paper between parallels, sheath the finished pack in epoxy board plus giant heat-shrink, and add a cradle strap so the assembly slides out for service without scuffing the deck.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L8927-L8933】
- Swap the stock loom for a Higo L1019 harness when you relocate controllers—three ~11 AWG phases plus seven signal leads share a sealed 7.7 mm jacket, making 6 mm bullet terminations and temperature telemetry tidy even in tight VSETT 9 axle cavities, but retire the plug on 60–70 mm motors where the jacket no longer fits cleanly without trimming the casting.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L11220-L11286】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L21320-L21404】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L653-L655】
- Owners measuring factory cabling are finding only ~2.5 mm² (≈13 AWG) phase copper, which stays cool around 90 A phase/30 A battery but needs 3 mm²+ upgrades; the latest QS8 anti-spark connectors arrive with 6 AWG cups, making them a better fit than AS150 hardware once dual controllers push 60 A+/135 A combined.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L10421-L10520】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L21404-L21516】
- Silicone-insulated 6 mm² (≈10 AWG) phase leads shrug off hub heat better than PVC jackets when rerouting harnesses, and the Higo L1019 bundle fits VSETT 9 axles once you swap to 6 mm bullets—just monitor MT60/XT150 connectors for heat on long pulls.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L11220-L11286】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L21320-L21516】
- VSETT 9 commuters can still package 18 S7 P (395 × 151 × 49 mm, 66.6 V/24.5 Ah) without deck spacers, but Italian riders report shops relabelling motors to 500 W and carrying invoices to appease police that assume stock 650 W ratings.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L577-L578】
- Expect roughly 5 V of sag at 70 % SOC on healthy 10+ packs; larger drops usually trace to resistive wiring or undervoltage cutoffs long before the controllers hit their phase limits.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L149-L149】
- Community CAD work pegs the factory deck spacer at 194–195 mm outer width (170–171 mm inner), 520 mm overall length (≈458 mm inner), and 470 mm to the front bevel, with cable notches up top—dimensions that let builders CNC or print replacements when relocating controllers outside the deck.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L635-L636】

### Logistics & Pricing Signals
- VSETT 10+ limited-edition hubs slot into Ninebot forks with minimal spreading; EU importers quote ~CHF 400 for dual motors with tires and warranty while AliExpress sellers hover around €150–€200 per motor plus €50–€170 shipping, encouraging group buys or forwarders to tame freight.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L5520-L5631】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L5695-L5718】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L6190-L6198】
- French riders even mask 500 W labels by explaining the second hub as an “electric brake,” underscoring how inspectors still look for engraved wattage even when firmware limits top speed.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L213-L213】
- AliExpress now lists OEM VSETT 10+ hubs near €159 before ~€52 freight, and French resellers are quoting €140 delivered for Blade-spec motors—regional pricing is falling but duties still dominate the landed cost.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L24060-L24088】
- Tudor’s latest order of 1 200 W/50 H hubs for 17 S P42A packs highlighted how AliExpress freight can balloon without prior negotiation—forwarders or pre-arranged shipping quotes keep costs sane.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L518-L518】
- Rion/Weped FF-spec motors are landing around €340 each through Face de Pin Sucé in France, but rising freight costs can erase the bargain for international buyers—budget shipping buffers before committing to group buys.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L746-L749】
- Nordic compliance rules push stealth builds—Denmark offers no theft coverage above ~20 km/h, Sweden limits legal scooters to 250 W/20 km/h with pedal assist, and Finland sells €50–€70/year policies that raise legal caps to ~1 kW when throttles stay discreet.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L535-L536】

### Brake & Hose Upgrades
- Bed sintered Kool-Stop pads with 30–60 full-power stops so they outlast the ~800 km organic cycle; keep spare 160 mm rotors on hand because the harder compound can chew ~1 mm off the disc within 1,000 km and squeals more at low speed.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L620-L621】
- Swap the stock 140 mm rotors for 160 mm SRAM Cleansweep or even 180 mm Magura MDR-P discs to gain braking torque and thermal mass; align pads carefully and retire washer stacks for proper brackets to avoid warping the new hardware under heavy loads.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L8211-L8253】
- External Magura routing needs the right banjos: the Elvedes Hydro Parts Kit provides dual M8 banjos for fork exits, while Jagwire quick-disconnects demand matching Jagwire hose runs and roughly $120–$125 in hardware for dual-motor layouts—and you still have to source the missing M6 banjo bolts separately or machine your own before 10×3 tires clear.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L9208-L9538】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L9901-L10054】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L544-L546】
- Jagwire-style external hose reroutes have already crushed Magura MT7 lines and robbed braking until the hose was replaced; once sealed they still risk banjo rub on 10×3 tires after a flat, so revert to inline routing if clearance drops below ~5 mm and pack spare hardware for roadside swaps.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L642-L644】
- Hope’s HFA701 kit ships the correct M6 banjos and bleed screws in one bundle; for odd fasteners, Venhill, Trickstuff, and AliExpress stock standalone M6 banjos and M5 bleeders, but most riders still buy the complete Jagwire kit to keep barb dimensions consistent.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L9947-L10216】
- Premium Braking Incas 2 kits deliver 3 mm 180/203 mm rotors and CNC spacers for €675–€850, but the oversized hardware can strike the ground during flats unless you flip banjos and re-check clearance on Monorim arms or other low-slung frames.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L562-L563】
- Magura’s support team still refuses to endorse third-party fittings and voids warranties when non-Magura pads or banjos are used, so document any custom M6 hardware or EU-sourced replacements before needing service.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L546-L546】
- Tighten Magura lever bleed screws with the supplied 0.5 Nm tool instead of guessing by feel—over-torqueing strips the lever threads and dumps pressure mid-ride.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L683-L684】

### Thermal Management & Instrumentation
- Dose 6–6.5 ml of Statorade per VSETT 10+ hub to drop winding peaks from ~145 °F to ~104 °F without noticeable drag; fill after the stator is seated, avoid metal syringe tips, and seal covers with silicone so the ferrofluid stays put. Larger 60 mm magnet motors may need 7–8 ml, while overfilling beyond ~8 ml adds friction—cheap AliExpress ferrofluids pass conductivity tests yet flash early, so riders stick with €30 EU-sourced Statorade and cap magnet temps around 90 °C when fluid is present.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L8463-L8518】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L531-L533】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L613-L615】
- Embed epoxy-coated 100 k B3950 probes under the windings with silicone adhesive, route a single sensor lead through the axle with the phases and halls, and stick with Statorade-grade ferrofluid—even “educational” blends have low flash points and unknown additives.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L10364-L11187】
- Use existing cover screws or purpose-drilled ports to inject ferrofluid without disturbing hall boards, then reseal both side covers to stop leaks once the hubs are topped off; drilled vent holes can drop temps another 5–10 °C on smaller motors but risk weeping fluid and water ingress, so weigh airflow against weather sealing.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L11140-L11216】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L615-L615】
- Check hubs seasonally and top off if fills dip below 4–8 ml—the community treats ≈6 ml as the sweet spot for VSETT motors and reseals covers after every inspection to prevent evaporation and leaks.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L574-L575】
- Bolt-on hubsinks with thermal paste plus deck spacers or ducted lighting housings cut from PVC/acrylic push heat into the airstream and make room for taller packs, helping sustained 70–75 km/h runs without cooking the stator.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L8601-L8786】
- Clamp controllers directly to aluminum structure with thin thermal pads and run lighting through relays; standalone fans on the harness keep running after shutdown because Spintend’s enable lead sources 12 V instead of sinking it.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L128-L128】
- External 12 V shrouds with mesh filters held 6.2 kW pulls near 50 °C in wet 8 °C weather; plan motor NTC installs before removing firmware current limits so logs capture the new cooling headroom.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L133-L133】
- Stock stator joints still need inspection—builders are ordering 10 k 3950 sensors for axle installs and reworking factory solder that left Huameng cores at 30–31 mΩ with stray splatter in the slots.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L135-L135】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L181-L181】

### Bearings & Rolling Hardware
- Swap factory bearings for Timken 2RS units when chasing tight steering—riders report they remove inner-race play without the drag penalty of SKF 2RSH seals, and ZZ/2Z shields remain a low-resistance option if paired with external simmering seals; VSETT 9/10 housings accept roughly 7.5 mm shafts when shields are deleted, so spec C3/C4 tolerance replacements accordingly.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L638-L640】
