# Seven Controllers

## Overview

Seven produces high-voltage VESC controllers designed for extreme performance electric scooters. Their controllers mirror Tronic X12 offerings with 24S and 30S capabilities. However, Seven is a new brand with limited field testing, firmware availability issues, and uncertain support infrastructure. This guide helps you understand what you're getting into if you choose Seven hardware.

## üí° Why Choose Seven?

‚úÖ **High Voltage**: 24S and 30S capability
‚úÖ **VESC Express**: Bundled telemetry daughterboard
‚úÖ **Toll MOSFETs**: 18-30 FET count
‚ö†Ô∏è **Trade-offs**: New brand, limited field data, firmware support uncertain, higher cost than Chinese alternatives

## üìã Quick Model Comparison

| Model | FET Count | Voltage | Aux Power | Key Feature | Status |
|-------|-----------|---------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Seven 18 | 18 Toll FETs | 24S target | 12V/4A | Express board | Limited availability |
| Seven 30 | 30 FETs | 30S ambitions | 12V/4A | Onboard memory | Rumored inventory |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Seven Warnings

üî¥ **New Brand Risk**: Limited field testing and community knowledge
üî¥ **Firmware Issues**: Support and documentation scarce
üî¥ **Tronic Mirror**: Similar to X12‚Äîonly 15-20% thermal advantage
üî¥ **Conservative Start**: 16S baseline: 180A battery / 300A phase‚Äîwork up slowly

## üí° Pro Tips

- **Early adopter risk**: Budget for potential firmware/support issues
- **Conservative tuning**: Start with proven 16S recipe, increase carefully
- **Documentation sparse**: Expect to pioneer rather than follow guides
- **Price comparison**: Evaluate against established Tronic/Spintend options

## Product Line

### Seven 18 (18-FET)

**Specifications**:[^lineup]
- **Voltage**: 24S marketing target
- **FET Count**: 18 Toll-class MOSFETs
- **Aux Power**: 12V / 4A rail
- **Telemetry**: Bundled VESC Express daughterboard
- **Logging**: Onboard memory

**PCB Construction**:[^thermal]
- 1.6mm FR-4 substrate
- Similar to Tronic X12 design
- Thermal advantage over X12: Only ~15-20%

### Seven 30 (30-FET)

**Specifications**:[^lineup]
- **Voltage**: 30S ambitions (marketing)
- **FET Count**: 30 MOSFETs
- **Aux Power**: 12V / 4A rail
- **Logging**: Onboard memory
- **Status**: Inventory still rumored, limited availability

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Both variants share the same firmware and support caveats. Expect limited documentation and community knowledge.

## Performance Baselines

### Conservative Starting Point

**Documented 16S Recipe**:[^fw_baseline]
- **Battery Current**: ~180A
- **Phase Current**: 300A
- **Field Weakening**: ~50A at 87% duty cycle

**Why Start Here**:
- Proven baseline from early adopters
- Allows thermal validation
- Provides comparison point
- Can increase gradually with logging

### Field Weakening Cautions

**Progressive Approach**:[^fw_baseline]
1. Start at documented 50A FW
2. Monitor temperatures closely
3. Log traction performance
4. Audit traction control behavior
5. Only increase after validation

> **üí° Pro Tip**: Heavier FW experiments should ramp slowly. Traction control audits are essential to avoid surprises at high speeds.

## Thermal Considerations

### FR-4 Substrate Limitations

**Paolo's Assessment**:[^thermal]
- MOSFETs sandwiched on 1.6mm FR-4
- Thermal improvement over X12: Only 15-20%
- Not a major leap in heat management

**Implications**:
- **Robust cooling still required**
- **Not significantly better than alternatives**
- **Racers may prefer direct-to-heatsink platforms** (e.g., K900)

**Cooling Requirements**:
- Mount to metal chassis with thermal paste
- Consider active cooling (fans)
- External heatsinks may be necessary
- Monitor temperatures on first rides

### Comparison with Alternatives

**vs. Tronic X12**:
- Similar thermal performance
- Seven has slight edge (15-20%)
- Not enough to justify switching if X12 working

**vs. Direct-Mount Controllers**:
- K900 and similar have better heat dissipation
- May be better choice for extreme builds
- Seven's advantage is limited

## Critical Firmware Issues

### Source Code Availability

**The Problem**:[^firmware]
- Ships with VESC Tool 6.06 binaries
- **No published source code**
- Violates GPL licensing
- Creates support and legal grey area

**What You Should Do**:
1. **Demand GPL-compliant source releases**
2. **Archive firmware before installing**
3. **Refuse closed drops on production fleets**
4. **Document everything**

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Legal Issue**: VESC firmware is GPL-licensed. Withholding source code violates the license. This puts users in a difficult position for support and modifications.

### VESC Tool Compatibility

**Known Issues**:[^firmware]
- Bluetooth pairing hiccups on 6.06
- Some users reverted to 6.05
- Wait for patches before updating
- Document software builds

**Best Practice**:
- Test firmware before deployment
- Keep backup of working versions
- Track VESC Tool version compatibility
- Join community forums for updates

### VESC Express Problems

**Bundled Hardware Fails**:[^express]
- Express board fails to enumerate reliably
- Cannot use for telemetry without workarounds
- Forces external solutions

**Workaround**:[^express]
- Hang separate CAN-connected Express module
- Use for telemetry until bundled version fixed
- Budget for external module in BOM

> **üìù Note**: JPPL had to add separate Express module for telemetry. This is an extra cost and complexity you should plan for.

## Supply Chain Reality

### Alibaba Direct Sales

**Current Situation**:[^supply]
- Controllers sold via Alibaba
- Direct from contract manufacturer
- Historical Seven/Tronic pricing
- **No brand support infrastructure**

**What This Means**:
- Treat as boutique hardware
- Self-managed documentation required
- No official warranty support
- Must solve problems yourself

### Availability Issues

**Delivery Problems**:[^1]
- Long lead times (4+ months reported)
- Partial shipments common
- Example: 6-pack order delivered only 2 units
- Plan for delays and shortages

**Recommendations**:
- Order well in advance
- Have backup plan
- Stock spares if possible
- Join community for group buys

### Limited Field Testing

**Documentation Gap**:[^supply]
- Few substantive field reviews
- Mostly promotional materials
- Community lacks long-term data
- Validation gaps remain

**Before Committing**:
- Research available reviews carefully
- Ask in community forums
- Look for actual user experiences
- Budget validation time and testing

## Installation & Setup

### Pre-Installation

**Documentation Requirements**:[^tracking]
1. Catalog serial numbers
2. Note MOSFET batch codes
3. Document thermal interface
4. Photograph all connections
5. Record firmware versions

**Why This Matters**:
- Community building comparison database
- Helps troubleshooting
- Enables warranty claims
- Contributes to collective knowledge

### Validation Testing

**First Ride Protocol**:[^thermal]
1. Start at conservative settings
2. Log thermal profiles immediately
3. Monitor all temperatures
4. Compare to X12 if available
5. Verify FR-4 sandwich delivers promised headroom

**What to Watch**:
- MOSFET temperatures
- Case temperatures
- Thermal throttling
- Performance consistency

## When to Choose Seven
