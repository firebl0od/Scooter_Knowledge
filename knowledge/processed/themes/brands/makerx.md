# MakerX Controllers Brand Dossier

## TL;DR
- Well-cooled MakerX singles routinely handle ~60 A battery and 180–200 A phase, but recurring DOA duals and MOSFET blowouts mean every install needs bench burn-in and spares on hand.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L93-L120】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L151-L153】
- Treat every 3.3 V accessory rail as sacred: footpads, throttles, and ADC gear all expect logic-level supplies, and miswiring to 5 V has already killed sensors and daughterboards.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L255-L256】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L347-L349】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L407-L409】
- G300-class stacks plateau around 22 S / 320 A phase today, while rumoured K900/KG00 firmwares remain unproven—plan upgrades around documented limits or step to C350/3Shul hardware for higher-voltage racing.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L416-L417】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L462-L462】

## Product Line Cheat Sheet
| Model | Nominal System | Community-Validated Envelope | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mini FOC / M100 | 13–16 S single | ~40 A battery, ≤120 A phase; raising phase to 70 A cooked an M100 immediately after detection reset | Triple-shunt design, silicone pads, and clean analog isolation impressed teardown crews, but treat it as a compact ebike controller and add stout torque arms before test rides.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part002_review.md†L135-L142】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L169-L177】 |
| GO-FOC HI100 / HI200 | 20 S single | 60 A battery / 200 A phase commuter baseline; hard-mounted enclosures kept FET temps in the 20s °C at 7 °C ambient | Rerun detection after mechanical work, verify thermistor coefficients on VESC 6.0, and keep fire extinguishers handy—bench launches have still blown MOSFET triplets on fresh boards.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L119-L120】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L151-L152】 |
| GO-FOC G300 / D100S | 20–22 S dual | 150 A battery / 250–300 A phase per controller on 20 S; saturation and heating spike above ~320 A phase at 22 S | Momentary power buttons need the VESC auto-off timer to behave, twin switches are simply paralleled, and ADC profile switches keep burning daughterboards without vetted wiring diagrams—document the harness before powering up.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L302-L329】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L407-L409】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L416-L417】 |
| Ubox 100/100 (MakerX badge) | 16–20 S dual | Shops cap them near 55 A battery / 170 A phase each on resin-backed revisions | Resin-backed shells still lag metal-core cooling; treat heatsinking as mandatory and log temps before raising limits.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L221-L224】 |

## Reliability & Support Signals
- Shop owners reported 70 % of incoming duals arriving faulty, with return shipping erasing the budget advantage; keep at least one spare controller on the shelf for every customer deployment.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L153-L153】
- Fire incidents on GO-FOC boards—even at 96 V / 80 A battery with added fans—show new batches need staged validation before matching Spintend or 3Shul duty cycles.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L321-L321】
- MakerX’s MOSFET choices (e.g., NECP045N85GU) mirror failure-prone Flipsky runs; continuous current should stay conservative unless the build adds serious heatsinking and airflow.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part002_review.md†L166-L168】
- Resellers are rebadging MakerX hardware at hefty markups—the Sur-Ron focused “MTO K2000” is simply a G300 in a cheap aluminium shell—so budget purchases accordingly and verify firmware provenance before assuming you’re getting unique electronics.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L401-L401】

## Setup & QA Checklist
1. **Disassemble on arrival.** Confirm thermal pads actually contact the shell, inspect solder joints, and restake capacitors before the first power-up—vibration still loosens untouched boards.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part002_review.md†L137-L138】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L312-L314】
2. **Rerun motor detection after any mechanical change.** Loose axles and firmware mismatches have corrupted FOC detection until owners reverted to 5.2 binaries and re-tightened hardware.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L119-L120】
3. **Verify thermistor coefficients on VESC 6.0+.** HI100 temperature scaling required swapping firmware profiles to regain accurate readings—log temps during the first rides to confirm.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L136-L136】
4. **Ble test harnesses for 3.3 V logic.** Probe footpads, throttles, and ADC rails before closing the case; missing 3.3 V feeds silently disable safety interlocks.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L255-L256】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L347-L349】

## Tuning Guardrails
- **Singles:** Start around 60 A battery / 180–200 A phase and raise only with frame-mounted heatsinks or machined enclosures; bag-mounted installs run 30–50 °C hotter under the same load.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L93-L120】
- **Duals:** Keep G300/D100S stacks near 150 A battery and ≤300 A phase on 20 S unless you have thermal telemetry proving headroom; logs above 320 A phase at 22 S showed rapid saturation and heat soak.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L416-L417】
- **Compact builds:** Reset phase limits on Mini FOC/M100 controllers after detection—the firmware’s 70 A default already destroyed one unit meant for 40 A continuous duty.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L169-L177】
- **Future hardware claims:** Treat the “K900” firmware bundle as roadmap noise until hardware ships; its 800 A battery / 1 200 A motor claims remain unverified marketing numbers.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L462-L462】

## Wiring & Accessory Integration
- **Power buttons:** Set App → General → Shutdown Method to a timed auto-off so the stock momentary switch behaves; remember both harness buttons are paralleled and do not isolate power on their own.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L302-L329】
- **ADC profile switches:** Publish wiring that routes throttles to ADC2 before using three-position gear toggles—ad-hoc rewires have already burned MakerX ADC daughterboards.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L407-L409】
- **BLE & telemetry:** When rescuing water-damaged boards, power MakerX BLE modules from the 5 V comm header and borrow UART2 for data to avoid overloading the 3.3 V rail.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L151-L152】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L552-L552】
- **Accessory rails:** Never tap 5 V loads directly from the logic PCB—route horns, lights, and fans through dedicated buck converters to protect the controller rails.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L248-L249】

## When to Reach for Alternatives
- If you need warranty-backed uptime or plan to ship customer scooters, shop feedback suggests pivoting to Spintend singles or 3Shul duals once MakerX DOA rates start eating labour margins.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L153-L153】
- Racers chasing sustained >320 A phase on 22 S have already reverted to C350/3Shul hardware; MakerX G300s simply saturate earlier and run hotter in the same chassis.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L416-L417】
