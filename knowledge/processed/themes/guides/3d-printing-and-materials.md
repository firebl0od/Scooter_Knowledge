# 3D Printing & Materials Playbook

## Filament Selection & Tooling
- PETG and carbon-filled PETG handle deck spacers and mounts, but CF blends demand ≥0.6 mm hardened-steel nozzles, heated chambers, and filament dryers to fight brittleness; PLA survives storage yet warps in high-heat climates like Las Vegas.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L118-L118】
- Tinmorry’s true chopped-fibre PETG-CF prints significantly tougher than powder-filled “carbon” blends—builders even turn the parts on lathes, whereas filler-only filaments offer little benefit beyond marketing.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L223-L223】
- Keep epoxy, cyanoacrylate, or specialty plastic adhesives on hand when reinforcing PETG/PLA accessories—these glues bond without melting the print and keep commuter hardware intact.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L120-L120】

## Production Discipline
- PETG battery holders crack when printed wet or too fast; veterans dry filament, slow to 80–120 mm/s with 0.6 mm nozzles, run 240–260 °C hotends, and tune retraction/fan settings before trusting cages to hold 21700 cells.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L192-L192】
- Printing transparent PETG carriers demands ~13 mm/s speeds, minimal cooling, and post-polish to avoid haze—stock Bambu profiles run too hot and cloud the parts immediately.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L243-L243】
- Stuffing twin 12 AWG leads into QS8 shells is notoriously tight—use plenty of flux, fully wet both conductors, and layer heat-shrink when the plastic lid refuses to latch cleanly.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L194-L194】
- Keep textured PEI sheets spotless (dish soap or IPA) and hold the bed near 95 °C so PETG grips without warping; too much adhesion still calls for careful part removal despite the texture.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L362-L362】
- Skip exotic PEEK or metal prints for high-load gearboxes—builders remind 130 kg riders pushing 150 A at 10 krpm that plastic reducers fail fast, while chain drives with QS90 hubs survive cramped frames far better.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L363-L363】
