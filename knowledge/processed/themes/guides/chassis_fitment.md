# Chassis Fitment and Maintenance

## Bearing and Wheel Upgrades

- Monorim 500 W hub motors accept 6001 rear bearings and 16003 stainless fronts when refreshing the rolling hardware, supporting wider tire conversions.[^bearing_sizes]
- Xiaomi frames can host 2.5–3.0 inch tires, but builders watch for clearance limits to avoid rubbing after the wider fitment.[^tire_clearance]

## Frame Stiffness Checks

- Removing the deck from a Dualtron Spider leaves the frame too flexy to stand on; riders are adding reinforcement and planning higher-power motor swaps only after hall wiring and 10 AWG phase leads are sorted to keep the chassis stable.[^dualtron_spider]

## Deck Fabrication & Accessories

- Builders experimenting with transparent deck plates pair 6 mm acrylic lids with foam bedding or CNC 12 mm plexiglass spacers to hide LED strips; plan for eventual cracking and reinforce mounts before sealing the deck.[^1]
- Rental G30 frames accept printed battery extenders, but high BMS harnesses can foul vertical cells.
  - rewire harness exits or add 2 mm spacers so deck lids close without pinching leads.[^2]
- Vsett headlight retrofits need stiffer stem brackets to keep elevated lamps from shaking and to shorten the dark “dead zone”; CAD the mount before drilling to preserve the OEM look.[^3]
- Ninebot rental chassis hide factory silicone seams, lockable battery latches, and swappable pack harnesses.
  - making them attractive donors for high-power conversions once you add disc-compatible brake mounts.[^4]
- Boosted Rev decks only swallow roughly 60×21700 cells (≈12 S5 P) plus an underslung controller, so builders often pair charge-only BMS + fuse strategies when ANT smart boards exceed the 100 mm × 40 mm envelope.[^5]
- Ninebot G30 rental frames remain coveted donor chassis thanks to non-folding stems, dual brakes, oil suspension, thicker tubing, and ~10 kg of extra steel that swallows 13 S 5 P 21700 packs and 1.2 kW hubs without flexing like stock Xiaomi frames.[^6]
- Community salvage runs keep surfacing Dualtron, Etwow, and Xiaomi donor parts.
  - complete with 60 V packs and heavy-duty motors
  - illustrating how friendships and group buys keep premium frames affordable.[^7]

## Xiaomi / Pro Tire & Cockpit Mods

- Removing a Xiaomi rear side plate lets the hub and stock tire slide off together; match inner diameter and width carefully before trimming metal for 10 inch solid conversions.[^xiaomi_sideplate]
- Fitting Deli 10×2 inch rubber on 1S/Pro 2 frames means relocating or trimming the rear-light connector, extending wiring, and resealing the exit with glue or grommets so the carcass clears the housing.[^deli_install]
- Mountain-bike cockpit swaps need an oval-to-round stem adapter, and relocating the BLE/dashboard harness is part of the job when upgrading to stiffer bars.[^mtb_stem]
- Later-production Xiaomi frames arrive packed with foam that must be excavated before routing new cabling or swapping motors—budget time for the cleanup.[^foam_cleanup]
- CST 10×2.25 tires cut for 152 mm rims refuse to seat on the Xiaomi 155 mm wheel and can foul the frame, so resell them or swap to scooter-specific casings instead of forcing the fit.[^cst_mismatch]
- Riders have squeezed CST 10×2.5 inch tires onto Pro/1S frames without deck spacers, but centering the carcass is tedious and benefits from suspension travel to clear the added width.[^cst_10x25]
- Ninebot G30 hub swaps into Xiaomi frames mean mixing two Monorim kits, machining spacers, lengthening motor leads, and slightly opening the controller plug before the axle seats reliably.[^g30_swap_fitment_chassis]
