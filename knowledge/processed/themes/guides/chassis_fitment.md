# Chassis Fitment and Maintenance

## Bearing and Wheel Upgrades

- Monorim 500 W hub motors accept 6001 rear bearings and 16003 stainless fronts when refreshing the rolling hardware, supporting wider tire conversions.[^bearing_sizes]
- EU suppliers now list 33×2 60 H hubs with 125 mm dropouts and 4 mm banana phases for roughly €300 shipped, giving builders a compact dual-drive option without custom axles.[^eu_33x2_hub]
- Xiaomi frames can host 2.5–3.0 inch tires, but builders watch for clearance limits to avoid rubbing after the wider fitment.[^tire_clearance]
- Scooter bearing techs warn against cracking open sealed hubs or stuffing them with 70 % grease fills; standard-clearance cartridges already tolerate thermal expansion, so riders stick with OEM-style fills instead of chasing C3 replacements that only add drag.[^sealed_bearing_fill]
- LY will ship 11‑inch wheels on 130 mm axles, yet riders still stack spacers and washers carefully when slotting 70–75 H Lonnyo stators into minibike frames to preserve dropout alignment and keep brake rotors centred.[^ly-11in-fit]

## Frame Stiffness Checks

- Removing the deck from a Dualtron Spider leaves the frame too flexy to stand on; riders are adding reinforcement and planning higher-power motor swaps only after hall wiring and 10 AWG phase leads are sorted to keep the chassis stable.[^dualtron_spider]
- Zero 10X stems, frames, and OEM suspension pieces have cracked when riders push past ~60 km/h; NetworkDir nudges builders toward Vsett 10+ chassis with dual stems when planning high-power conversions.[^zero10x_fail]
- Zero 10X conversions that jump to 11-inch wheels also need upgraded brake kits for rotor clearance before the new wheelset is rideable.[^zero10x_11in]
- Slack Core 920R frames have snapped before upgrade work even began; inspect boutique chassis for hidden damage before pouring money into power mods.[^slack_core_fail]
- Dualtron race builds still require heavy frame, fork, and motor rework despite the platform’s popularity, because Minimotors outsources much of the hardware.[^dualtron_outsource]
- Raising the rear ride height without a quality damper has triggered wobble on Dualtrons; balanced geometry can still reach 150 km/h damper-free, but the Spanish crew noted stricter policing as another reason to keep setups stable and discreet.[^dualtron-geometry]

## Front-End Stability Upgrades

- JREV Speedfork assemblies have earned rider trust up to ~70 km/h, while the crew flatly rejects pushing Xiaomi/Ninebot stock steering to those speeds—budget commuters need fork and headset upgrades before high-speed tuning.[^speedfork]

## Deck Fabrication & Accessories

- Builders experimenting with transparent deck plates pair 6 mm acrylic lids with foam bedding or CNC 12 mm plexiglass spacers to hide LED strips; plan for eventual cracking and reinforce mounts before sealing the deck.[^1]
- Face de Pin Sucé’s carbon extension for Dualtron Victor/Luxury/Compact adds ~605 mm of mounting length (≈434 mm usable with a Ubox) and fits a 21 S 6–7 P pack plus an 85 V 240 A controller, giving Spanish builders a bolt-on path to longer batteries without welding.[^dualtron-extension]
- Rental G30 frames accept printed battery extenders, but high BMS harnesses can foul vertical cells.
  - rewire harness exits or add 2 mm spacers so deck lids close without pinching leads.[^2]
- Vsett headlight retrofits need stiffer stem brackets to keep elevated lamps from shaking and to shorten the dark “dead zone”; CAD the mount before drilling to preserve the OEM look.[^3]
- Ninebot rental chassis hide factory silicone seams, lockable battery latches, and swappable pack harnesses.
  - making them attractive donors for high-power conversions once you add disc-compatible brake mounts.[^4]
- Riders comparing Ninebot Max G2 and G30 frames noted the G2’s suspension improves vibration longevity, while SNSC rental frames shrugged off ~80 km/h guardrail hits with only peripheral damage; the same thread shared DNM shock fitment tips, 13"×7" tire swaps, and a lever-free hub tire removal method to avoid scratching rims.[^sns_c_service]
- Boosted Rev decks only swallow roughly 60×21700 cells (≈12 S5 P) plus an underslung controller, so builders often pair charge-only BMS + fuse strategies when ANT smart boards exceed the 100 mm × 40 mm envelope.[^5]
- Ninebot G30 rental frames remain coveted donor chassis thanks to non-folding stems, dual brakes, oil suspension, thicker tubing, and ~10 kg of extra steel that swallows 13 S 5 P 21700 packs and 1.2 kW hubs without flexing like stock Xiaomi frames.[^6]
- Community salvage runs keep surfacing Dualtron, Etwow, and Xiaomi donor parts.
  - complete with 60 V packs and heavy-duty motors
  - illustrating how friendships and group buys keep premium frames affordable.[^7]
- SNSC 2.3 rental frames are drying up as fleets pivot to Okai hardware, so builders now scout Brussels, Düsseldorf, and other
operator auctions to stockpile Ninebot donor chassis before the supply disappears.[^sns_supply]

## Zero 10X and Thunder Fitment Updates

- Some regions still deliver the Zero 10X with a dummy front hub; upgrading to dual drive means importing a live motor (often from FalconPEV), rewiring Zero/Mantis harness mixes, and watching frame integrity once speeds climb past ~100 km/h.[^zero_dummy_hub]
- Paolo’s measurements show 11-inch hubs need ≈145 mm fork spacing and a longer axle on the Zero 10X, while the stock 125 mm dropouts cap builds around 65 H 10-inch motors unless you extend the swingarm or buy a conversion kit.[^zero_11inch]
- Face de Pin’s clamp that ties both steering-nut lockrings to the stem has become the go-to insurance mod against Thunder hinge failures, and the same crew is packaging 22 S 8 P C350 controllers inside proprietary cases to keep rain out during race duty.[^thunder_clamp]
- High-power Zero builds in France are stuffing ~22 S 11 P packs inside bespoke frames (“French style”) while relocating controllers externally; the tradeoff is custom fabrication cost for every donor chassis.[^zero_custom_packaging]
- Lengthened frames can still squeeze 24 S stacks without deck spacers, but Andrei notes the stretched wheelbase complicates transport through elevators and tight hallways.[^extended_frames]
- The current fork project clears 70 H motors yet likely refuses thicker 75 H stators, so confirm measurements before ordering oversized hubs.[^fork_clearance]
## Tire Clearance & Suspension Packaging

- Jumbo tires can clear swingarms with about 4″ per side, but slicks get unforgiving on wet pavement—rain wheels need conservative throttle maps or treaded rubber to stay upright.[^jumbo-clearance]
- Rob Ver’s Vsett 11 stretches 80 mm rubber over 100 mm rims, drops the suspension, and favours 130/40 PMTs to keep tyre and controller temps near 40 °C during hard street riding.[^rob-vsett-packaging]
- High-travel (≈150 mm) suspensions pushed Ausias to move controllers up into the chassis and rely on model-specific O-rings to seal tubeless split rims; under-deck mounts were scraping at full compression.[^ausias-travel]
- Ambrosini/LY CNC rims still hover around €100–€120 each, expect 155 mm axles for 6.5″ fitments, and ship with hefty AWG 7–8 phase sleeves in the harness.[^ly-rims]

## Legal Compliance & Model Selection

- Spain’s 2027 homologation wave keeps Thunder 3 scooters road-legal while sidelining many Nami models; enforcement remains spotty, but the 25 km/h cap still applies on public roads.[^spain-homologation]
- Achilleus Limited editions hover around €3,200 versus roughly €4,300 for a homologated Thunder 3, making Achilleus a roomy, VESC-ready base with Thunder arms and 11″ tyre support.[^achilleus-pricing]
- Victor Luxury + owners log about 20 S 8 P capacity once controllers move outside the deck, whereas Achilleus builders can machine an aluminium neck box to hide VESC hardware for stealth and legality.[^victor-capacity][^achilleus-neck]
- Anything above ~4 kW still falls under motorcycle registration rules in many EU locales even if day-to-day enforcement is lax, so keep paperwork in mind before chasing headline power figures.[^eu-motorcycle]
- Yamal notes how quickly dual VESC builds, premium cells, brakes, and backup scooters inflate project budgets—plan for a spare vehicle while the main chassis is torn down.[^project-costs]
- Mock up any 20 S 12 P Ninebot G30 pack in cardboard first; fitting more than ~120 cells demands stacked modules, tall spacers, remote ESCs, and acceptance of 65–70 kg curb weights plus suspension geometry shifts.[^g30_20s12p_mockup]

## Platform-Specific Fitment Notes

- NetworkDir’s Zero 10X 50H hub shares the 16×4 shell used on some Vsett swaps, and his failure traced back to a ripped phase/hall harness—add strain relief before pushing higher current motors in those decks.[^networkdir_harness]
- Vsett 10+ owners chasing Spintend swaps cite Bluetooth telemetry, speed-limit removal, and auxiliary 3 S packs as key wins but still want documentation for reusing stock lighting and accessory ports before committing.[^vsett_spintend]
- Apo’s hunt for Vsett 10+ harness pinouts and alternative Ubox sellers underscores the need for accurate diagrams and sourcing references when converting rental frames.[^vsett_pinout]
- Segway Ninebot SNSC 2.0 frames handle 200 kg loads and add only ~1.3 kg over a G30, but U.S. builders still rely on auctions or fleet sell-offs to source them.[^snsc_availability]
- Zero 10X belly measurements land around 123 × 32 × 50 cm once stock gear is removed, giving builders a sanity check before speccing 38 cm packs and dual-controller layouts.[^zero10x_belly_volume]

## Tire & Wheel Fitment Debates

- Zero/Vsett owners keep steering riders toward CST 10×3 or PMT 10×3.5 rubber, warning that Xuancheng slicks feel soft and short-lived above 4 kW without traction control, and that 10" rims look undersized paired with 165 mm rotors.[^zero_vsett_tires]
- Fork swaps to 145 mm travel assemblies only slightly improve Zero 10X trail figures, so builders still rely on dampers and ~60 % rear phase bias to calm wobble during launches.[^zero_fork_trail]
- Recent feedback praises Tuovt 90/55-6 tires for surviving broken pavement far longer than PMT slicks, which grip harder but shred quickly on rough commutes.[^tuovt_feedback]
- Track riders rate Xuancheng slicks for circuit grip yet call them too fragile for street abuse, preferring CST-patterned 11" tires day-to-day and warning that 3.5" rubber looks tractor-wide on Zero/Vsett rims unless pressure and rim width are tuned carefully.[^xuancheng_race][^zero_vsett_3p5_width]

## Geometry & Stability Notes

- Vsett 10+ and other C-fork scooters remain unstable above roughly 80 km/h; riders linked fatal wobbles to poor trail and still recommend better geometry or dampers before chasing triple-digit speeds.[^c_fork_instability]
- PuneDir and others shared tank-slapper incidents (e.g., 78 km/h on a Zero) to emphasize how quickly oscillations escalate, especially with lighter riders or mediocre tires.[^tank_slapper_logs]
- Traction control set around an 80 000 ERPM differential preserves CST 10×3 tires, whereas disabling TC shredded them within days.[^tc_tire_preservation]
- Kirill countered the doom posts by listing inherently stable production scooters (Segway GT1/GT2, ST1/ST2, Inmotion RS, large Wepeds, Monorim-modded G30s, NAMI Blast), underscoring that C-fork wobble is model-dependent.[^stable_platforms]
- Zero 10X racers logging 10 kW tunes even ran traction control off for tire noise yet capped real-world speed near 60 km/h to preserve stability on twin-stem frames.[^zero10x_tc_off]
- Zero 10X suspension tuning now centres on 165 mm/1,500 lb rear springs and 135–150 mm/1,500 lb fronts, with ~70 kg riders still favouring stiff rates for asphalt while heavier racers rotate 1,250–1,800 lb coils by terrain.[^zero10x_spring_rates]
- Tighten wobbly Zero/Vsett folding clamps with a rag and channel locks; once torqued properly the joint rarely folds tool-free, but it stops stem play before rotors groove the pads.[^folding_clamp_fix]

## High-Power Suspension & Frame Upgrades

- The Weepor’s rear suspension bottoms out under heavier riders; budget an EXA 150 mm shock or similar-quality damper before unlocking more power.[^weepor_shock]
- Thunder-frame builders are mapping 22 S11 P battery bays (with BMS) or 22 S10 P layouts using next-gen 40PL cells to balance weight and capacity.[^thunder_pack]
- Scarcity and steep local pricing are pushing some builders away from Thunder frames entirely, opting for heavier Nami or Teverun Blade platforms despite the weight hit.[^thunder_scarcity]
- Raphael Foujiguara Performance now offers reinforced decks, welded battery boxes, and mudguards tailored to 20 S-class scooters with Thunder-style necks—handy when OEM frames skip critical accessories.[^rfp_accessories]

## Suspension & Fork Notes

- Kaabo storm-style frames diverge: the GTR carries a 135 mm shock while cheaper variants rely on twin 40 mm springs stacked with bushings, echoing “pogo” complaints about block-sprung forks and guiding upgrade planning.[^kaabo-suspension]

## Custom Dropouts & Frame Surgery

- Deep sleeper builds can demand literal chassis surgery: GABE’s stretched frame now pulls the hub forward ~15 cm, machines legacy fork dropouts for disc clearance, adds steel reinforcement beams, and repackages the battery as a 22 S 6 P stack to maintain geometry.[^dropout_mods]
