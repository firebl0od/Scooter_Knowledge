# Chassis Fitment and Maintenance

## Bearing and Wheel Upgrades

- Monorim 500 W hub motors accept 6001 rear bearings and 16003 stainless fronts when refreshing the rolling hardware, supporting wider tire conversions.[^bearing_sizes]
- Xiaomi frames can host 2.5–3.0 inch tires, but builders watch for clearance limits to avoid rubbing after the wider fitment.[^tire_clearance]

## Frame Stiffness Checks

- Removing the deck from a Dualtron Spider leaves the frame too flexy to stand on; riders are adding reinforcement and planning higher-power motor swaps only after hall wiring and 10 AWG phase leads are sorted to keep the chassis stable.[^dualtron_spider]

## Deck Fabrication & Accessories

- Builders experimenting with transparent deck plates pair 6 mm acrylic lids with foam bedding or CNC 12 mm plexiglass spacers to hide LED strips; plan for eventual cracking and reinforce mounts before sealing the deck.[^1]
- Rental G30 frames accept printed battery extenders, but high BMS harnesses can foul vertical cells.
  - rewire harness exits or add 2 mm spacers so deck lids close without pinching leads.[^2]
- Vsett headlight retrofits need stiffer stem brackets to keep elevated lamps from shaking and to shorten the dark “dead zone”; CAD the mount before drilling to preserve the OEM look.[^3]
- Ninebot rental chassis hide factory silicone seams, lockable battery latches, and swappable pack harnesses.
  - making them attractive donors for high-power conversions once you add disc-compatible brake mounts.[^4]
- Boosted Rev decks only swallow roughly 60×21700 cells (≈12 S5 P) plus an underslung controller, so builders often pair charge-only BMS + fuse strategies when ANT smart boards exceed the 100 mm × 40 mm envelope.[^5]
- Ninebot G30 rental frames remain coveted donor chassis thanks to non-folding stems, dual brakes, oil suspension, thicker tubing, and ~10 kg of extra steel that swallows 13 S 5 P 21700 packs and 1.2 kW hubs without flexing like stock Xiaomi frames.[^6]
- Community salvage runs keep surfacing Dualtron, Etwow, and Xiaomi donor parts.
  - complete with 60 V packs and heavy-duty motors
  - illustrating how friendships and group buys keep premium frames affordable.[^7]
- SNSC 2.3 rental frames are drying up as fleets pivot to Okai hardware, so builders now scout Brussels, Düsseldorf, and other
operator auctions to stockpile Ninebot donor chassis before the supply disappears.[^sns_supply]
