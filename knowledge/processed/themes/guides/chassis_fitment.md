# Chassis Fitment and Maintenance

## Bearing and Wheel Upgrades

- Monorim 500 W hub motors accept 6001 rear bearings and 16003 stainless fronts when refreshing the rolling hardware, supporting wider tire conversions.[^bearing_sizes]
- Xiaomi frames can host 2.5–3.0 inch tires, but builders watch for clearance limits to avoid rubbing after the wider fitment.[^tire_clearance]

## Frame Stiffness Checks

- Removing the deck from a Dualtron Spider leaves the frame too flexy to stand on; riders are adding reinforcement and planning higher-power motor swaps only after hall wiring and 10 AWG phase leads are sorted to keep the chassis stable.[^dualtron_spider]

## Deck Fabrication & Accessories

- Builders experimenting with transparent deck plates pair 6 mm acrylic lids with foam bedding or CNC 12 mm plexiglass spacers to hide LED strips; plan for eventual cracking and reinforce mounts before sealing the deck.[^1]
- Rental G30 frames accept printed battery extenders, but high BMS harnesses can foul vertical cells.
  - rewire harness exits or add 2 mm spacers so deck lids close without pinching leads.[^2]
- Vsett headlight retrofits need stiffer stem brackets to keep elevated lamps from shaking and to shorten the dark “dead zone”; CAD the mount before drilling to preserve the OEM look.[^3]
- Ninebot rental chassis hide factory silicone seams, lockable battery latches, and swappable pack harnesses.
  - making them attractive donors for high-power conversions once you add disc-compatible brake mounts.[^4]
- Boosted Rev decks only swallow roughly 60×21700 cells (≈12 S5 P) plus an underslung controller, so builders often pair charge-only BMS + fuse strategies when ANT smart boards exceed the 100 mm × 40 mm envelope.[^5]
- Ninebot G30 rental frames remain coveted donor chassis thanks to non-folding stems, dual brakes, oil suspension, thicker tubing, and ~10 kg of extra steel that swallows 13 S 5 P 21700 packs and 1.2 kW hubs without flexing like stock Xiaomi frames.[^6]
- Community salvage runs keep surfacing Dualtron, Etwow, and Xiaomi donor parts.
  - complete with 60 V packs and heavy-duty motors
  - illustrating how friendships and group buys keep premium frames affordable.[^7]

## Zero 10X and Thunder Fitment Updates

- Some regions still deliver the Zero 10X with a dummy front hub; upgrading to dual drive means importing a live motor (often from FalconPEV), rewiring Zero/Mantis harness mixes, and watching frame integrity once speeds climb past ~100 km/h.[^zero_dummy_hub]
- Paolo’s measurements show 11-inch hubs need ≈145 mm fork spacing and a longer axle on the Zero 10X, while the stock 125 mm dropouts cap builds around 65 H 10-inch motors unless you extend the swingarm or buy a conversion kit.[^zero_11inch]
- Face de Pin’s clamp that ties both steering-nut lockrings to the stem has become the go-to insurance mod against Thunder hinge failures, and the same crew is packaging 22 S 8 P C350 controllers inside proprietary cases to keep rain out during race duty.[^thunder_clamp]
- High-power Zero builds in France are stuffing ~22 S 11 P packs inside bespoke frames (“French style”) while relocating controllers externally; the tradeoff is custom fabrication cost for every donor chassis.[^zero_custom_packaging]
- Lengthened frames can still squeeze 24 S stacks without deck spacers, but Andrei notes the stretched wheelbase complicates transport through elevators and tight hallways.[^extended_frames]
- The current fork project clears 70 H motors yet likely refuses thicker 75 H stators, so confirm measurements before ordering oversized hubs.[^fork_clearance]
