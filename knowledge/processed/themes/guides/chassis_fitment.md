# Chassis Fitment and Maintenance

## Bearing and Wheel Upgrades

- Monorim 500 W hub motors accept 6001 rear bearings and 16003 stainless fronts when refreshing the rolling hardware, supporting wider tire conversions.[^bearing_sizes]
- Xiaomi frames can host 2.5–3.0 inch tires, but builders watch for clearance limits to avoid rubbing after the wider fitment.[^tire_clearance]

## Frame Stiffness Checks

- Removing the deck from a Dualtron Spider leaves the frame too flexy to stand on; riders are adding reinforcement and planning higher-power motor swaps only after hall wiring and 10 AWG phase leads are sorted to keep the chassis stable.[^dualtron_spider]

## Deck Fabrication & Accessories

- Builders experimenting with transparent deck plates pair 6 mm acrylic lids with foam bedding or CNC 12 mm plexiglass spacers to hide LED strips; plan for eventual cracking and reinforce mounts before sealing the deck.[^1]
- Rental G30 frames accept printed battery extenders, but high BMS harnesses can foul vertical cells.
  - rewire harness exits or add 2 mm spacers so deck lids close without pinching leads.[^2]
- Vsett headlight retrofits need stiffer stem brackets to keep elevated lamps from shaking and to shorten the dark “dead zone”; CAD the mount before drilling to preserve the OEM look.[^3]
- Ninebot rental chassis hide factory silicone seams, lockable battery latches, and swappable pack harnesses.
  - making them attractive donors for high-power conversions once you add disc-compatible brake mounts.[^4]
- Boosted Rev decks only swallow roughly 60×21700 cells (≈12 S5 P) plus an underslung controller, so builders often pair charge-only BMS + fuse strategies when ANT smart boards exceed the 100 mm × 40 mm envelope.[^5]
- Ninebot G30 rental frames remain coveted donor chassis thanks to non-folding stems, dual brakes, oil suspension, thicker tubing, and ~10 kg of extra steel that swallows 13 S 5 P 21700 packs and 1.2 kW hubs without flexing like stock Xiaomi frames.[^6]
- Community salvage runs keep surfacing Dualtron, Etwow, and Xiaomi donor parts.
  - complete with 60 V packs and heavy-duty motors
  - illustrating how friendships and group buys keep premium frames affordable.[^7]

## Tire Clearance & Suspension Packaging

- Jumbo tires can clear swingarms with about 4″ per side, but slicks get unforgiving on wet pavement—rain wheels need conservative throttle maps or treaded rubber to stay upright.[^jumbo-clearance]
- Rob Ver’s Vsett 11 stretches 80 mm rubber over 100 mm rims, drops the suspension, and favours 130/40 PMTs to keep tyre and controller temps near 40 °C during hard street riding.[^rob-vsett-packaging]
- High-travel (≈150 mm) suspensions pushed Ausias to move controllers up into the chassis and rely on model-specific O-rings to seal tubeless split rims; under-deck mounts were scraping at full compression.[^ausias-travel]
- Ambrosini/LY CNC rims still hover around €100–€120 each, expect 155 mm axles for 6.5″ fitments, and ship with hefty AWG 7–8 phase sleeves in the harness.[^ly-rims]

## Legal Compliance & Model Selection

- Spain’s 2027 homologation wave keeps Thunder 3 scooters road-legal while sidelining many Nami models; enforcement remains spotty, but the 25 km/h cap still applies on public roads.[^spain-homologation]
- Achilleus Limited editions hover around €3,200 versus roughly €4,300 for a homologated Thunder 3, making Achilleus a roomy, VESC-ready base with Thunder arms and 11″ tyre support.[^achilleus-pricing]
- Victor Luxury + owners log about 20 S 8 P capacity once controllers move outside the deck, whereas Achilleus builders can machine an aluminium neck box to hide VESC hardware for stealth and legality.[^victor-capacity][^achilleus-neck]
- Anything above ~4 kW still falls under motorcycle registration rules in many EU locales even if day-to-day enforcement is lax, so keep paperwork in mind before chasing headline power figures.[^eu-motorcycle]
- Yamal notes how quickly dual VESC builds, premium cells, brakes, and backup scooters inflate project budgets—plan for a spare vehicle while the main chassis is torn down.[^project-costs]
