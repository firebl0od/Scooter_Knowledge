# Chassis Fitment and Maintenance

## Bearing and Wheel Upgrades

- Monorim 500 W hub motors accept 6001 rear bearings and 16003 stainless fronts when refreshing the rolling hardware, supporting wider tire conversions.[^bearing_sizes]
- Xiaomi frames can host 2.5–3.0 inch tires, but builders watch for clearance limits to avoid rubbing after the wider fitment.[^tire_clearance]
- Oversize 10×2.5 in CST casings on 155 mm rims usually need 2–2.5 mm of machining for a safe bead seat—take material from the rim, not the tire, to avoid hidden cuts that explode at speed.[^denis-cst-machining]

## Frame Stiffness Checks

- Removing the deck from a Dualtron Spider leaves the frame too flexy to stand on; riders are adding reinforcement and planning higher-power motor swaps only after hall wiring and 10 AWG phase leads are sorted to keep the chassis stable.[^dualtron_spider]

## High-Power Motor Fitment

- Builders stepping up to 72 V 1,000–1,500 W swaps lean on PaoloWu’s 1.2 kW hub motors with larger magnet stacks to cut copper loss and boost torque versus stock cans.[^paolo72v]
- Mirono reminds newcomers those wide motors usually need inverted Monorim forks or a rear-drive conversion to clear 10" rubber, so plan fork and chassis work alongside the motor purchase.[^mirono-fork]
- Dropping a 1 000 W hub into a Xiaomi deck means flipping the Monorim fork so the larger rim and six-bolt rotor clear the chassis; the stock fork orientation simply lacks space.[^denis-1000w-fit]
- Ninebot Max frames swallow 1 000 W hubs (with or without suspension) thanks to wider dropouts, while Xiaomi rears still lack clearance even with Monorim shocks—front installs remain the practical Xiaomi option.[^denis-1000w-max]

## Deck Fabrication & Accessories

- Builders experimenting with transparent deck plates pair 6 mm acrylic lids with foam bedding or CNC 12 mm plexiglass spacers to hide LED strips; plan for eventual cracking and reinforce mounts before sealing the deck.[^1]
- Rental G30 frames accept printed battery extenders, but high BMS harnesses can foul vertical cells.
  - rewire harness exits or add 2 mm spacers so deck lids close without pinching leads.[^2]
- Vsett headlight retrofits need stiffer stem brackets to keep elevated lamps from shaking and to shorten the dark “dead zone”; CAD the mount before drilling to preserve the OEM look.[^3]
- Francois splits his 13 S8 P pack between the deck and an external half because the Xiaomi frame can’t swallow the whole module; he bolts dual VESCs to the deck as a heatsink and warns that bag-mounted controllers sacrifice cooling and theft resistance.[^denis-francois]
- Ninebot rental chassis hide factory silicone seams, lockable battery latches, and swappable pack harnesses.
  - making them attractive donors for high-power conversions once you add disc-compatible brake mounts.[^4]
- Boosted Rev decks only swallow roughly 60×21700 cells (≈12 S5 P) plus an underslung controller, so builders often pair charge-only BMS + fuse strategies when ANT smart boards exceed the 100 mm × 40 mm envelope.[^5]
- Ninebot G30 rental frames remain coveted donor chassis thanks to non-folding stems, dual brakes, oil suspension, thicker tubing, and ~10 kg of extra steel that swallows 13 S 5 P 21700 packs and 1.2 kW hubs without flexing like stock Xiaomi frames—but budget time for drilling, longer hardware, and pricey OEM parts when you swap motors or poles.[^6][^denis-rental-weight]
- Portable AWD Xiaomi builds creep toward 29 kg once dual batteries, locks, and beefy motors are installed—many riders settle on stout rear-wheel-drive G30 conversions instead of lugging dual-motor frames upstairs.[^denis-awd-weight]
- G30 Max decks are still wider than Xiaomi Pro trays, so cross-platform motor or deck swaps need custom spacer stacks even when the housings look identical.[^denis-g30-width-fit]
- Community salvage runs keep surfacing Dualtron, Etwow, and Xiaomi donor parts.
  - complete with 60 V packs and heavy-duty motors
  - illustrating how friendships and group buys keep premium frames affordable.[^7]
- Converting Xiaomi rear dropouts to driven hubs means drilling the axle slot, fitting adapter plates, and committing with threadlocked hardware—the change is effectively irreversible once the opening is enlarged.[^denis-rear-drive]
