# Chassis Fitment and Maintenance

## Bearing and Wheel Upgrades

- Monorim 500 W hub motors accept 6001 rear bearings and 16003 stainless fronts when refreshing the rolling hardware, supporting wider tire conversions.[^bearing_sizes]
- Xiaomi frames can host 2.5–3.0 inch tires, but builders watch for clearance limits to avoid rubbing after the wider fitment.[^tire_clearance]
- LY will ship 11‑inch wheels on 130 mm axles, yet riders still stack spacers and washers carefully when slotting 70–75 H Lonnyo stators into minibike frames to preserve dropout alignment and keep brake rotors centred.[^ly-11in-fit]

## Frame Stiffness Checks

- Removing the deck from a Dualtron Spider leaves the frame too flexy to stand on; riders are adding reinforcement and planning higher-power motor swaps only after hall wiring and 10 AWG phase leads are sorted to keep the chassis stable.[^dualtron_spider]
- Raising the rear ride height without a quality damper has triggered wobble on Dualtrons; balanced geometry can still reach 150 km/h damper-free, but the Spanish crew noted stricter policing as another reason to keep setups stable and discreet.[^dualtron-geometry]

## Deck Fabrication & Accessories

- Builders experimenting with transparent deck plates pair 6 mm acrylic lids with foam bedding or CNC 12 mm plexiglass spacers to hide LED strips; plan for eventual cracking and reinforce mounts before sealing the deck.[^1]
- Face de Pin Sucé’s carbon extension for Dualtron Victor/Luxury/Compact adds ~605 mm of mounting length (≈434 mm usable with a Ubox) and fits a 21 S 6–7 P pack plus an 85 V 240 A controller, giving Spanish builders a bolt-on path to longer batteries without welding.[^dualtron-extension]
- Rental G30 frames accept printed battery extenders, but high BMS harnesses can foul vertical cells.
  - rewire harness exits or add 2 mm spacers so deck lids close without pinching leads.[^2]
- Vsett headlight retrofits need stiffer stem brackets to keep elevated lamps from shaking and to shorten the dark “dead zone”; CAD the mount before drilling to preserve the OEM look.[^3]
- Ninebot rental chassis hide factory silicone seams, lockable battery latches, and swappable pack harnesses.
  - making them attractive donors for high-power conversions once you add disc-compatible brake mounts.[^4]
- Boosted Rev decks only swallow roughly 60×21700 cells (≈12 S5 P) plus an underslung controller, so builders often pair charge-only BMS + fuse strategies when ANT smart boards exceed the 100 mm × 40 mm envelope.[^5]
- Ninebot G30 rental frames remain coveted donor chassis thanks to non-folding stems, dual brakes, oil suspension, thicker tubing, and ~10 kg of extra steel that swallows 13 S 5 P 21700 packs and 1.2 kW hubs without flexing like stock Xiaomi frames.[^6]
- Community salvage runs keep surfacing Dualtron, Etwow, and Xiaomi donor parts.
  - complete with 60 V packs and heavy-duty motors
  - illustrating how friendships and group buys keep premium frames affordable.[^7]

## Suspension & Fork Notes

- Kaabo storm-style frames diverge: the GTR carries a 135 mm shock while cheaper variants rely on twin 40 mm springs stacked with bushings, echoing “pogo” complaints about block-sprung forks and guiding upgrade planning.[^kaabo-suspension]
