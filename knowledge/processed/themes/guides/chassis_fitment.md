# Chassis Fitment and Maintenance

## Bearing and Wheel Upgrades

- Monorim 500 W hub motors accept 6001 rear bearings and 16003 stainless fronts when refreshing the rolling hardware, supporting wider tire conversions.[^bearing_sizes]
- Xiaomi frames can host 2.5–3.0 inch tires, but builders watch for clearance limits to avoid rubbing after the wider fitment.[^tire_clearance]

## Frame Stiffness Checks

- Removing the deck from a Dualtron Spider leaves the frame too flexy to stand on; riders are adding reinforcement and planning higher-power motor swaps only after hall wiring and 10 AWG phase leads are sorted to keep the chassis stable.[^dualtron_spider]
- Zero 10X stems, frames, and OEM suspension pieces have cracked when riders push past ~60 km/h; NetworkDir nudges builders toward Vsett 10+ chassis with dual stems when planning high-power conversions.[^zero10x_fail]
- Zero 10X conversions that jump to 11-inch wheels also need upgraded brake kits for rotor clearance before the new wheelset is rideable.[^zero10x_11in]
- Slack Core 920R frames have snapped before upgrade work even began; inspect boutique chassis for hidden damage before pouring money into power mods.[^slack_core_fail]
- Dualtron race builds still require heavy frame, fork, and motor rework despite the platform’s popularity, because Minimotors outsources much of the hardware.[^dualtron_outsource]

## Deck Fabrication & Accessories

- Builders experimenting with transparent deck plates pair 6 mm acrylic lids with foam bedding or CNC 12 mm plexiglass spacers to hide LED strips; plan for eventual cracking and reinforce mounts before sealing the deck.[^1]
- Rental G30 frames accept printed battery extenders, but high BMS harnesses can foul vertical cells.
  - rewire harness exits or add 2 mm spacers so deck lids close without pinching leads.[^2]
- Vsett headlight retrofits need stiffer stem brackets to keep elevated lamps from shaking and to shorten the dark “dead zone”; CAD the mount before drilling to preserve the OEM look.[^3]
- Ninebot rental chassis hide factory silicone seams, lockable battery latches, and swappable pack harnesses.
  - making them attractive donors for high-power conversions once you add disc-compatible brake mounts.[^4]
- Boosted Rev decks only swallow roughly 60×21700 cells (≈12 S5 P) plus an underslung controller, so builders often pair charge-only BMS + fuse strategies when ANT smart boards exceed the 100 mm × 40 mm envelope.[^5]
- Ninebot G30 rental frames remain coveted donor chassis thanks to non-folding stems, dual brakes, oil suspension, thicker tubing, and ~10 kg of extra steel that swallows 13 S 5 P 21700 packs and 1.2 kW hubs without flexing like stock Xiaomi frames.[^6]
- Community salvage runs keep surfacing Dualtron, Etwow, and Xiaomi donor parts.
  - complete with 60 V packs and heavy-duty motors
  - illustrating how friendships and group buys keep premium frames affordable.[^7]

## High-Power Suspension & Frame Upgrades

- The Weepor’s rear suspension bottoms out under heavier riders; budget an EXA 150 mm shock or similar-quality damper before unlocking more power.[^weepor_shock]
- Thunder-frame builders are mapping 22 S11 P battery bays (with BMS) or 22 S10 P layouts using next-gen 40PL cells to balance weight and capacity.[^thunder_pack]
- Scarcity and steep local pricing are pushing some builders away from Thunder frames entirely, opting for heavier Nami or Teverun Blade platforms despite the weight hit.[^thunder_scarcity]
- Raphael Foujiguara Performance now offers reinforced decks, welded battery boxes, and mudguards tailored to 20 S-class scooters with Thunder-style necks—handy when OEM frames skip critical accessories.[^rfp_accessories]
