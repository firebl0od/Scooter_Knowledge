# Monorim Suspension & Hardware Field Manual

## TL;DR
- **Build around quality pneumatics and matched shocks.** Pair Monorim front forks with DNM or EXA dampers and a proper rear shock; foam “solid” tires and mismatched hardware shake magnets loose above ~45 km/h.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L13-L14】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L717-L717】
- **Recreate the factory hardware stack.** Reinstall the short upper screw, small top ring, and fresh bearings during stem assemblies—missing parts are the leading cause of Monorim wobble.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L22-L23】
- **Upgrade fasteners immediately.** Swap the kit’s soft bolts for grade 12.9 hardware, trim overly long screws, and add washers/Loctite so pivots stop loosening and knocking after a few rides.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L515-L515】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L1171-L1171】
- **Treat Monorim-branded packs and AWD kits as projects, not plug-and-play.** External batteries ship without brake/BMS harnesses, cheap charge-line diodes waste voltage, and the 48 V AWD bundle under-delivers—build your own pack/controller stack instead.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L82-L83】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L119-L120】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L215-L216】
- **Mind brake adapters and clearance.** The 500 W disc adapter replaces the dust cover (don’t stack it), expect to machine or source custom rear spacers because Monorim won’t sell the bracket separately, and budget a second hydraulic brake for 50 km/h builds.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L88-L89】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L176-L177】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L752-L752】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L118611-L118621】
- **Reinforce long-shock installs with full “sandwich” plates and softer springs.** Welding gussets on one side just drives the rear arm into the deck; add inner/outer steel plates, re-bend the chassis with the battery removed, and source lower-rate springs instead of cutting coils.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L90030-L90134】

## Hardware Checklist
| Area | Baseline Actions | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Stem & crown** | Reuse the OEM short screw and ring, press new bearings, torque gradually while cycling the fork to settle spacers.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L22-L23】 | Missing pieces cause wobble within the first ride. |
| **Axles & spacers** | Ignore the “304 stainless” marketing—magnets still stick; replace with grade 12.9 or titanium fasteners and confirm spacer stacks before tightening.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L25-L26】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L312-L312】 | Prevents bent pivots and maintains steering geometry. |
| **Pivot bolts** | Swap soft hardware for grade 12.9 bolts, trim excess length, add washers/self-locking nuts, and reapply grease every ~30 hours.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L515-L515】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L718-L718】 | Stops squeaks and protects harnesses routed near the swingarm. |
| **Shocks** | Favor 150 mm units for balanced geometry; 165 mm springs require trimming headlight mounts and spacer plates to avoid binding.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L197-L198】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L682-L682】 | Longer shocks need headlight relocation and extra hardware. |
| **Brakes** | Use the 500 W adapter as a replacement cover, not an add-on; plan custom rear spacers and a second hydraulic brake for >50 km/h builds.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L88-L89】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L176-L177】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L752-L752】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L118611-L118621】 | Cheap adapters flex and warp thin rotors at speed. |
| **Steerer retention** | Replace damaged Monorim star nuts with paired bike star nuts driven in on a sacrificial bolt and fit longer stem bolts when the stack grows.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L87201-L87203】 | Prevents bar play after repeated rebuilds. |

## Electrical & Power Considerations
- **Avoid Monorim-branded batteries.** Listings omit cell types, arrive without brake/BMS leads, rely on lossy series diodes, and frequently ship with reversed polarity—community techs recommend sourcing packs from Scootermode/VTA/EtorroS or building customs with Rita/Happy BMS instead.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L119-L120】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L215-L216】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L604-L604】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L1245-L1245】
- **Treat AWD kits as incomplete.** The bundled controllers and motors underperform; veterans build dual OEM-controller setups or pair reputable Blade/Vsett hubs with reinforced wiring for real gains.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L82-L83】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L610-L611】
- **Cable management matters.** Stress-relieve converter leads with RTV or zip ties, upgrade undersized motor connectors, and monitor hall sensors—cheap 500 W hubs ship with fragile sensors that fail quickly at 48 V.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L31-L32】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L761-L761】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L650-L650】
- **Bulk-buy caveats:** Alibaba runs on enticing €80 offers for Monorim 500 W hubs, but 11.11 sales slow fulfillment and factory harnesses often omit the connectors bundled with retail kits—budget extra parts and time when importing direct.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L171-L171】
- **Print in PETG or ASA.** Denis and Happy’s go-to recipe—≈230 °C nozzle with 100 °C first-layer bed (≈80 °C afterward, or 231 °C/101 °C/81 °C on PEI)—keeps brackets from warping in hot decks.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L164-L168】

## Ride & Maintenance Notes
- Keep pneumatic 10×3 tires at proper pressure and drill valve holes when converting from solids; true ULIP/PMT casings seat cleanly and avoid rubbing once mudguard bolts are countersunk and fenders braced.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L109-L111】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L274-L274】
- Run tubeless PMT/Xuancheng tires without slime; if riders insist on sealant, stick to aluminum-safe formulas so bare rims don’t corrode.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L140-L143】
- Grease pivots, cycle air shocks after storage, and mist lithium spray on small bearings to silence knocks; replace pivot pins proactively before they bend from jumps.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L718-L718】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L1293-L1294】
- Expect maintenance on brake adapters: sand mounts square, shorten bolts so XTech calipers clear, and check torque frequently because soft kit hardware loosens quickly.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L611-L611】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L1001-L1001】
- When rotor spacing grows beyond a few millimetres, machine a single-piece steel ring (≈5–10 mm thick) instead of stacking loose washers—builders still experimenting with 1.7 mm washer stacks under Blade rotors quickly see alignment drift; confirm whether your hub uses Xiaomi’s 5-bolt or aftermarket 6-bolt pattern before cutting the spacer.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L22903-L22942】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L23098-L23100】
- Add foam over the shallow Wildman bag screws and orient power leads upward so clamps and levers cannot puncture packs once the suspension stretches the cockpit.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L274-L276】
- Keep electronics isolated from vibration by routing Rita/Happy harnesses along the controller side and using Monorim stem slack before clamping covers shut.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L966-L966】
- Sandwich the deck with inner/outer steel plates when running Ulip/Konyk-length rear shocks, re-bend the frame without the battery installed, and commission softer springs rather than trimming coils so the arm stops chewing into the chassis.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L90030-L90136】
- Seal every cable pass-through with silicone, grease bearings, and capture 3D-printed spacers between silicone layers while keeping threads clean so the deck stays serviceable yet waterproof.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L553-L553】
- Use the supplied kickstand spacer block on 10-inch rear swingarm kits; without it the longer wheelbase leans dangerously and can strip kickstand bolts.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L107-L107】

## Red Flags & When to Walk Away
- Skip ultra-cheap “Monorim” forks—thin sheet-metal clones crack almost immediately and jeopardize the entire front end.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L1366-L1366】
- Avoid 48 V Monorim batteries until the vendor ships proper harnesses and cells; Denis labels them “pure China” with fake Panasonic specs and weak controllers.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L1290-L1291】
- If hardware keeps loosening despite upgrades, inspect for missing shim stacks or bent spacer plates—the fork geometry changes with 40–55 mm spacers and can punch through the deck without reinforcement plates on both sides.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L312-L312】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L87046-L87066】

## Commissioning Workflow
1. **Dry-fit suspension and brake adapters** before wiring—confirm clearance for pneumatics, rotor spacing, and headlight mounts so you know which spacers to fabricate.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L176-L177】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L274-L274】
2. **Replace hardware & grease pivots** with grade 12.9 bolts, Loctite, and lithium grease; retorque after the first 20 km to catch settling play.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L515-L515】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L1171-L1171】
3. **Wire power responsibly:** run Rita/Happy harnesses along the controller side, add DC/DC converters for accessories, and log early rides to verify current stays within Rita/Happy limits.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L966-L966】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L31-L32】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L618-L618】
4. **Inspect after shakedowns**—look for spacer creep, cracked adapters, loose calipers, or pack harness chafing before committing to long commutes.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L515-L515】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L611-L611】
