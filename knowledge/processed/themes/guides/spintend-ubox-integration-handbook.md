# Spintend Ubox Reliability & Integration Handbook

## TL;DR
- Treat every unit as a kit: tear it down before energising, photograph QC issues for support, and follow VESC-safe power-up rituals (precharge, discharge caps, avoid hot-plugging) to prevent latent shorts or MCU damage.[^1][^2][^3]
- Clamp the case hard to a heat sink and budget active airflow if phase current will exceed ~120 A per channel; pad thickness and surface prep matter more than exotic materials.[^4][^5][^6][^7]
- Keep regen conservative—match battery regen amps to pack capacity, disable traction-control modes on single-motor builds, and check faults via USB before power-cycling if Bluetooth is absent.[^8][^9][^10]
- Plan accessories around the power rails you actually have: the dual exposes cruise/lighting outputs and a 12 V rail, but the single requires external buck converters and careful ADC board wiring.[^11][^12][^13][^14]
- Expect shipping delays without premium couriers; EU buyers still face VAT unless orders route through AliExpress IOSS or arrive mis-declared, so document deliveries for smoother RMAs.[^15][^16][^17]
- Synchronise controller power-ups before linking CAN and budget an external BLE bridge for singles—the current batches still ship without Bluetooth and can pop transceivers if one side wakes late.[^can-cite][^single-ble]
- Treat the built-in alarm as a failsafe only: if the remote misses handshake at boot the Ubox will scream while still energising the hub, so wire brake interlocks or auxiliary sirens for theft deterrence.[^ubox-alarm]

## Pre-Delivery QC & Bench Setup
1. **Full Disassembly:** Crack the enclosure to inspect for solder balls, missing hardware, or flux residue before the first power-on—multiple riders received “sealed” units with conductive debris or missing faceplate screws.[^1][^2]
2. **Tear down second-hand singles.** Used single-channel Uboxes have surfaced with loose solder balls, uneven MOSFET pad contact, and even the case cutting through silicone on a phase lead, so clean, re-insulate, and reassemble before trusting a pre-owned unit.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L20826-L20905】
3. **Document Everything:** Photograph the internals and keep serials handy; Spintend has honoured RMAs after fires and board failures when owners supplied teardown evidence.[^18]
4. **Note hardware revisions:** Production singles now ship with extra silicone pads, tidier layouts, and easier-to-service connectors compared with beta boards—still verify pinouts before repurposing older harnesses so refreshed logic stages aren’t back-powered.[^single-rev]
5. **Bench Rules:** Wire the entire harness before energising, precharge ≥20 S packs, discharge bus caps after unplugging, keep ADC inputs ≤3.3 V, and eliminate ground loops to avoid repeat STM32 deaths.[^3]
6. **Skip USB-only power.** Powering a Ubox over USB-C without the main pack has triggered destructive ground loops—stick to Bluetooth/Wi‑Fi for configuration unless the controller is fully energised and sharing the same ground.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L20906-L20947】
7. **Initial Power Tests:** Bring the controller up on a fused bench supply with the BMS discharge FET enabled; if regen previously latched undervoltage faults, confirm the pack’s protection MOSFETs are awake before running detection.[^19]
8. **Detection housekeeping:** Enable the phase-filter checkbox only during motor detection—leaving it on while riding reintroduces noise and ABS overcurrent faults.[^phase-filter]
9. **Screen current-sense offsets:** Before installing, power each single on the bench and confirm the current-sense op-amps report sane offsets (hundreds of counts, not 30 or 4,000); multiple “new” boards arrived with shorted amplifiers that later blew input capacitors and XT60s under normal reconnects.[^offset-screening]
10. **Log the hardware revision.** The latest single board swaps to an aluminium PCB with G015N10 MOSFETs—stick with the matching gate network instead of random FET swaps or you’ll destabilise the driver.[^g015n10]
11. **Document standby draw and LED behaviour.** Expect roughly 20 mA idle consumption with the latching button off; any illuminated switch LED indicates wiring backfeeding the logic rail and needs chasing before sealing the deck.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L25713-L25761】

## Thermal Management & Mounting
- **Firmware Limits:** Stock firmware starts derating around 75–85 °C and shuts down near 100 °C, so increase cutbacks only after verifying thermistor calibration.[^4]
- **Interface Upgrades:** Replacing spongy pads with copper shims or thicker (≈1 mm) thermal sheets plus quality paste dropped MOSFET temps 15–20 °C during 100–140 A runs when the case was clamped directly to the deck.[^5][^6]
- **Pad compression matters on singles.** Riders pegged 65–75 °C MOSFET temps at only 50–60 A battery until they replaced the factory 0.5 mm pads with stiffer 1 mm material or swapped cases to improve clamp pressure, and thicker Thermal Grizzly stacks cut peaks from ~67 °C at 45 A/110 A to ≈61 °C at 50 A/130 A while enabling 150 A launches without errors.[^single-pad]
- **Airflow & Deck Prep:** Add 40–90 mm 12 W fans between stacked boards, cut intake/exhaust slots in the deck, sand paint off mounting faces, and clamp copper bars or aluminium spreaders to the case with quality paste when regen pushes single-Ubox stacks past 65–70 °C.[^7]
- **Strip insulating layers before sealing.** Support now recommends peeling heat-shrink from the MOSFET bank, sanding paint off decks, adding stick-on sinks, and even packing thermal paste/grease baths when enclosures must stay sealed to pull more heat into the chassis.[^single-pad]
- **Orientation affects cooling.** Mount the enclosure upside down so the MOSFET half of the split case sits against metal—otherwise the transistor side cooks while the logic half stays cool.[^single-orientation]
- **Deck coupling experiments.** Happy Giraffe’s logs show 110 A phase launches dropping from 68 °C to the mid-40s once the case was bolted directly to bare metal or tied into copper heat pipes, while exposed boards on 1 cm aluminium slabs shed heat rapidly if you insulate the logic section against shorts.[^single-heatpipes]
- **Spot hardware differences by voltage class.** Early 75 V betas shipped with exposed copper busbars while some 100 V batches hid higher-Rds(on) FETs under resin and even arrived with loose solder balls—open every case and plan extra heatsinking or thicker housings if you draw a resin-packed revision.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L25795-L25855】
- **Expected Benchmarks:** Well-mounted duals have logged ~100 A battery / 130 A phase at ≈45 °C, while poor contact in sealed Weped decks let cases soar to 80 °C during 500 A combined pulls—plan extra cooling above those loads. Square-wave Zero 11X controllers still out-launch under-cooled 60 V Ubox setups until phase limits rise and airflow improves, underscoring the need for fans in cramped decks.[^6][^20][^zero-launch]
- **Plan hardware for earless cases.** 85/240 housings still ship without mounting ears and rely on tiny M2.5 hardware, so riders print brackets, retap threads, or glue adapters before long-travel suspensions knock under-deck mounts loose.[^31]
- **Repurpose retired baseplates.** Builders are bolting dead 75/200 heatsinks under live controllers—stacking aluminium shims and thin pads or even radiators tied into Dualtron side plates—to add surface area without redesigning the deck.[^baseplate_spreader]
- **Use the 85240 passthroughs carefully.** The case exposes top-exit slots for phase leads; reroute wiring through them only after shielding the foam insulation pads so they do not tear or short against the enclosure.[^85240_passthrough]

## Power Limits, Regen & Current Planning
- **Current Envelope:** Treat 120–130 A phase per motor (≈160 A ABS max) as the practical ceiling for daily dual setups; sensor stutter above ~85 A usually signals failed MOSFETs or loose leads, not tuneable instability.[^21]
- **Single 100/100 baselines:** Lonnyo 65 H commuters now hover around 130–135 A phase, 85–90 A battery, and 150–180 A absolute on single Ubox 100/100 stacks, trimming duty to 98 % and kicking in FW around 88 % to eliminate stutter before heat creeps past 40 °C.[^u100_daily]
- **Regen Discipline:** Bench testing shows that even –5 A battery regen can trip controllers on unloaded wheels; cap regen amps to roughly the pack’s amp-hour rating plus a small overhead so the FETs absorb the excess.[^8]
- **High-Voltage Safeguards:** Dual owners run ~2×135 A phase / 2×71 A battery within 70 °C so long as regen stays off during full-charge launches and higher-voltage packs (17 S+) are bled a few percent before re-enabling braking.[^22]
- **22 S experiments demand regen discipline.** Builders chasing 22 S/150 A tunes on 85/150 hardware disable regen or upgrade MOSFETs and capacitor banks; Smart Repair confirmed stock silicon only survives 22 S when braking stays mechanical, and veterans point voltage-hungry riders toward Rage Mechanics’ C350 once 30 S capability is mandatory.[^22s_mod]
- **Know the Ubox 100/100 envelope.** Smart Repair still caps the single at 22 S with regen disabled on the e-brake input; it ships at 135 A phase / 180 A absolute without ST-Link pads or beefy 12 V rails, so budget external regulation for accessories.[^u100-guardrails]
- **Current sharing proof point.** Dual builds have logged 180 A phase / 130 A battery on the rear and 150 A/90 A up front while holding FETs near 39 °C when pads are clamped flat—use these as sanity checks that your thermal stack-up is working.[^dual-current]
- **Duty & Field Weakening:** Keep field-weakening reserved for cooled builds; previous fires stemmed from wizard runs on fresh installs, so validate base detection and duty-cycle ramps before layering FW or traction aids.[^18][^23]
- **Expect commuter hubs to need more current.** Maike-branded “3000 W” dual hubs stayed near 25 km/h until motor current climbed toward 140 A (≈70 A battery) and the owner improved thermal coupling with frame-mounted pads or fans—stock 16 S packs with dual XT60s still bottleneck upgrades.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L354-L354】

## Controls, Accessories & IO
- **Remote & Cruise:** The bundled 2.4 GHz remote offers cruise, horn, and light controls via the receiver, reducing parallel looms compared with bare PPM throttles.[^11]
- **Cruise troubleshooting:** If the remote beeps but never holds speed, confirm the PPM switch channel toggles in VESC Tool, match firmware between paired controllers, and ensure the accessory rail stays above 5 V when cruise engages.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part004.txt†L11970-L12020】
- **Brake Inputs:** The ADC daughterboard supports normally-open/closed levers and selectable 5 V or 3.3 V rails—set the switches before plugging Magura/Shimano sensors to avoid shorting hall supplies.[^13]
- **Lighting Power:** Dual controllers expose a ≈1.5 A 12 V rail for lighting relays, but singles lack this output; budget fused DC-DC converters instead of stealing from the fan header.[^12][^14]
- **Horn channel expectations:** The horn terminal happily drives compact 12 V siren boards (e.g., GREATZT QSI-4840); riders trim the plastic shell to a ≈30 × 20 mm module and mount it behind the dash so the alarm wakes with the scooter instead of relying on battery-powered noisemakers.[^horn-siren]
- **CAN & Anti-Slip:** Updated harnesses let one single wake another over CAN, yet anti-slip belongs on dual configurations—leaving it active on a solo motor causes low-speed cut-outs with red/green blink codes.[^10][^24]
- **Bench-start requirements:** Ubox 100/100 controllers refuse to boot from USB-C alone—wire the latching 16 mm start button or a proper low-voltage switch instead of relying on the BMS as a master disconnect.[^start-button]
- **Secure the ADC switches.** Warranty cleanups now include removing stray solder balls, upgrading to 1 mm pads before reassembly, and gluing the ADC adapter’s slide switch in the 5 V position to stop intermittent throttle brownouts.[^adc-service]
- **SmartDisplay ecosystem:** NFC-enabled Zero-style throttles with UART RFID drop into VSETT looms and pair cleanly with SmartDisplay pass-through; CAN “police mode” presets remain in test, aiming to mute the front motor while leaving rear torque for roadside compliance.[^nfc-throttle][^police-mode]

## Firmware, Logging & Fault Recovery
- **Version Discipline:** Stick with Spintend’s vetted firmware packages (e.g., 100 A battery limit files) unless you have cooling to exploit the 300 A hardware bins; mismatched binaries raise noise and reliability issues.[^25]
- **Heed support’s 5.3 guidance:** Spintend is still telling riders to remain on 5.2 until its customised 5.3 binaries finish soak testing, so archive configs and be ready for SWD recovery before flashing betas.[^fw53_support]
- **Expect V2 logic tweaks.** The latest single boards add self-resetting fuses on every 5 V/12 V/3.3 V rail, but the ADC daughterboard still faults when 5 V throttles hit the 3.3 V MCU input and VESC Tool 3.01 crashes during calibration—stick with Tool 3.00/firmware 5.2 until Spintend issues patched binaries.[^adc-v2]
- **Unofficial 300 A bins:** Community Micro-USB and USB‑C binaries lift the single’s 100 A factory ceiling to 300 A but void warranty—install only if you have the airflow, copper interfaces, and logs to prove the MOSFETs survive the extra load.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L20181-L20187】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L20190-L20299】
- **BLE Options:** Official BLE dongles arrive pre-flashed and tax-paid via AliExpress, while DIY NRF boards need extra programming; keep at least one link for live tuning even if you prefer wired sessions.[^26]
- **NRF quick-start:** When the NRF header is the only free UART, flash a generic NRF51 via USB, solder it to the dedicated header, and power-cycle to pair—no need to steal the ADC adapter’s UART pads.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part004.txt†L8813-L8818】
- **Fault Retrieval:** If Bluetooth is absent, the controller retains the last fault until shutdown—connect via USB before cycling power so valuable diagnostics aren’t lost.[^10]

## Known Field Failures & Mitigations
- **Continuity-check every harness.** A v2 80 V single shipped with its Bluetooth lead reversed and killed the module immediately—probe polarity and confirm JST orientation before first power to avoid sacrificial electronics.[^27]
- **Investigate surging with hardware checks first.** Sudden sensorless surges or oscillations usually trace back to loose phase plugs or damaged harnesses—share CSV logs and tug-test connectors before blaming firmware.[^sensorless-harness]
- **Diagnose ADC adapters before blaming firmware.** VSETT 11+ owners logged CAN dropouts, stuck brake beeps, and latched brake inputs when ADC V2 boards half-failed after 6.0 updates; reflash, reseat grounds, and isolate the adapter before pursuing RMAs.[^28]
- **Keep throttles on the 3.3 V rail and mount adapters close.** Routing halls through 5 V accessory pins or long unshielded runs has blown STM32 inputs; park the ADC board beside the controller, use divider networks, and rely on Vedder’s detach timeout to hand control back to hardware cleanly.[^29]
- **Treat thermal spikes as potential moisture ingress.** Riders seeing 190 °C MOSFET readings traced the fault to condensation inside the case—warm the enclosure, dry the PCB, and reseal gaskets before raising firmware cutoffs.[^30]
- **Power both controllers before linking CAN.** Rowan’s 4WD scooter blew a CAN transceiver and a power switch when one Ubox woke late—sync power buttons or isolate the bus before hot-plugging.[^can-cite]

## Logistics & Support Notes
- **Warranty Responsiveness:** Spintend has replaced fire-damaged units and keeps spare power/logic boards on hand, which contrasts with poorer experiences on competing FlipSky hardware.[^18]
- **Shipping Choices:** Direct orders sometimes arrive underdeclared (sub-$30) and dodge VAT, but DHL eCommerce frequently delays or loses parcels; veterans now pay for FedEx or AliExpress Standard to avoid customs limbo.[^15][^16]
- **EU VAT reality:** Accessories still ship without prepaid VAT, leaving riders with €30 import bills on €20 parts; lobby Spintend for IOSS handling or bake the extra cost into quotes for EU customers.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L20979-L21033】
- **Document capacitor failures.** DHL eCommerce returns have taken five weeks and multiple single-Ubox RMAs cite repeat capacitor blowouts; paying for FedEx and filming unboxings gives leverage when escalating support tickets.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L20741-L20888】
- **EU VAT Planning:** Accessories shipped without prepaid VAT trigger €30 fees on €20 parts—push for IOSS channels or budget the surcharge when ordering spares.[^17]
- **US distribution hub.** Recent 85/240 batches now ship from a New Jersey warehouse, and sub-$1,000 orders have cleared without added tariffs, cutting replacement lead times for North American riders.[^32]
- **AliExpress IOSS shift.** Expect 21–24 % VAT to be collected upfront on AliExpress, but the move eliminates the €10–€24 postal handling fees that used to ambush EU deliveries.[^ioss-update]
- **Integrated BMS watch.** Builders are lobbying Spintend for an in-house BMS after comparing Daly’s slim 120 A boards with ANT’s bulkier smart units—deck space under 25 mm is still precious.[^bms-lobby]
- **Ubox Pro horizon.** Spintend’s Pro variant is in final 100 V testing, but veterans plan to tear down every unit for stray solder or debris after finding contamination in earlier runs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L20490-L20506】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L20940-L20950】

[^31]: 85/240 mounting anecdotes covering custom brackets, retapped threads, and thermal pad tweaks to secure earless housings.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L20537-L20541】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L20575-L20583】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L20581-L20587】
[^32]: Spintend 85/240 shipments now staging through a New Jersey hub for faster, low-tariff deliveries into the United States.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L17321-L17325】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L18632-L18638】
[^g015n10]: New single-board revisions ship on aluminium PCBs with G015N10 MOSFET stacks and tuned gate networks—stick with the factory parts instead of improvising swaps.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L115-L115】
[^u100-guardrails]: Smart Repair reiterated that the Ubox 100/100 tops out at 22 S, ships with 135 A phase / 180 A absolute limits, and should keep regen off the e-brake path unless you’re ready to swap FETs; it also omits ST-Link pads and beefy 12 V rails compared with 85xxx units.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L19186-L19195】
[^start-button]: The same teardown confirmed the 100/100 refuses to boot from USB-C—wire the latching 16 mm start button or another 5 V trigger instead of depending on the BMS as a master switch.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L19300-L19318】
[^zero-launch]: Stock Zero 11X square-wave controllers still beat 60 V Ubox launches until phase limits rise and airflow improves, making active cooling a prerequisite for parity.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L103-L103】
[^single-rev]: Production single-channel Uboxes now include extra silicone pads and cleaner layouts compared with beta boards, but builders still verify harness pinouts before reuse to avoid damaging refreshed logic stages.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L738-L740】
[^phase-filter]: Motor-wizard phase filters should be disabled after detection to avoid noise and ABS overcurrent faults on Spintend controllers.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L31-L31】
[^nfc-throttle]: NFC-enabled Zero-style throttles with UART RFID modules plug into VSETT harnesses and align with SmartDisplay pass-through plans.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L241-L241】
[^police-mode]: CAN “police mode” presets are being prototyped so SmartDisplay buttons can disable the front motor while leaving rear torque for roadside checks.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L203-L203】
[^ioss-update]: AliExpress’ IOSS rollout adds 21–24 % VAT upfront but removes the €10–€24 postal handling fees across much of the EU.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L211-L211】
[^bms-lobby]: Riders are pressing Spintend for an integrated BMS after comparing Daly’s slimmer 120 A layout with ANT’s bulkier smart units and touch displays.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L212-L212】
[^single-ble]: The single-channel Spintend still ships without Bluetooth modules, so riders rely on SmartDisplay pass-through or external dongles and power both controllers before plugging in CAN to avoid ground loops.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L298-L298】
[^ubox-alarm]: Spintend bakes an alarm into the Ubox that sounds whenever the remote handshake fails at boot yet still allows the motors to drive, nudging builders toward physical interlocks for theft defence.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L302-L307】
[^dual-current]: Riders logging simultaneous front/rear data on dual builds reported 180 A phase / 130 A battery rear and 150 A/90 A front at ≈39 °C MOSFETs when thermal pads were clamped properly.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L326-L333】
[^horn-siren]: GREATZT QSI-4840 siren boards shrink to ≈30 × 20 mm once trimmed and tie directly into the horn output, giving 120–125 dB alerts without battery-powered accessories.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L23001-L23039】
