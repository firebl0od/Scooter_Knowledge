# Scooter Diagnostic Toolkit & Field Practices

## Core Instruments
- **Handheld multimeter:** Expect budget meters to ship with 12 V A23 cells and fragile F200 mA fuses—stock replacements and keep a sturdier backup such as the Mustool MT111 on hand for daily troubleshooting.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L164-L164】
- **Cell testing bench:** Pair LiitoKala or Opus bays with a 3.3 Ω / 25 W Ohmite resistor block so you can discharge or capacity-test loose 18650s before grouping them into packs, especially when customer batteries arrive full.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L165-L165】
- **Firmware lifeline:** ST-Link V2 programmers remain the fastest recovery path for bricked dashboards, ESCs, and Rita-linked BMS boards—clip onto the pads, flash stock firmware, then resume Bluetooth updates once communications return. Modern Ninebot Max dashboards also demand ST-Link access because recent BLE revisions block OTA downgrades.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L47-L49】【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L166-L166】【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L331-L331】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L103-L104】
- **Express flashing workflow:** Smart Repair now flashes VESC Express modules by powering them over USB alone, picking the COM port inside the ESP Programmer panel, and only then reconnecting CAN; if a controller’s USB-C port dies you can still stream live data over CAN/BLE, but configuration changes require a direct USB session to the ESC.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L228-L231】
- **Capture the visuals.** The next deliverable asks for screenshot walkthroughs, USB-C failure triage, and CAN-only telemetry expectations—bake them into the guide so riders aren’t guessing how to recover a module that only boots over Wi‑Fi.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L318-L318】
- **Low-voltage logging:** Keep Bluetooth thermometers or CR2032-powered loggers in the spares bin when validating experimental packs so you can capture temperature spikes before they cook cells.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L372-L372】
- **High-precision GPS.** Dragy’s DRG70 bumps to a 10th-gen u-blox receiver with tighter accuracy but its magnetic mount won’t grab anodised aluminium stems—budget steel inserts or adhesive plates before track days and consider 3D-printed steel-backed clamps for VSETT stems.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L153-L155】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part004.txt†L4101-L4132】
- **AC milliohm meter:** Industry-standard 1 kHz testers like the YR1035+ expose weak cells quickly even if readings differ from DC load checks—ideal for sorting cells before pack assembly.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L206-L206】
- **PlatformIO build environment:** The aging VescUart Arduino libraries compile reliably under PlatformIO (Nano/Pro Mini profiles); the stock Arduino IDE often misses dependencies for custom dashboards. Use the PlatformIO quick-start from the VESC telemetry display project to clone configs, flash boards, and share binaries quickly.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L261-L261】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part004.txt†L12626-L12646】
- **VESC Tool mobile update workflow:** Back up motor/app XMLs before flashing in the Android/iOS app, use the in-app firmware flasher while the pack is connected, and sideload older APKs if 6.0+ releases hide configuration menus—the crew now keeps a rollback archive specifically for field recoveries.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part004.txt†L12073-L12089】
- **Insulation & adhesive supplies:** Stock RTV silicone, Kapton, and zip ties to strain-relieve DC/DC converters and harnesses; vibration snaps converter leads unless they are glued or tied back to the PCB before the scooter ever rolls.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L31-L32】
- **Instant translation:** Plus Messenger’s built-in translator lets techs follow Spanish- and French-language repair chats without copy-paste gymnastics—handy when sourcing parts from multinational groups.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L1665-L1689】
- **Dedicated GPS logger:** Relive overstates peak speed by ~7 km/h when GPS drops, so shops now run Speed View GPS Pro for floating dashboards, exportable logs, and reliable range data alongside VESC telemetry.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L6003-L6013】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L6414-L6436】

## Wiring & Harness Checks
1. **Start at the XT30:** After any crash or curb strike, verify the adapter output voltage before chasing other faults; browned phase pins or half-seated BMS harnesses are the most common culprits when scooters power-cycle on bumps.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L195-L195】
2. **Inspect pack protection:** Cheap “25 A” eBay BMS boards routinely trip around 18 A despite balanced cell groups—swap in reputable 20–30 A hardware before blaming Rita or the controller for brownouts.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L172-L172】
3. **Match radio gear:** Immobiliser and alarm kits ship in multiple frequencies; confirm your remote (315 MHz vs. 415 MHz) before hard-wiring to the scooter’s 5 V accessory tap so the system actually arms.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L167-L167】
4. **Treat locks as consumables:** Light cable locks such as compact Master Lock loops work for coffee stops only if they stay lubricated with graphite—dry mechanisms jam quickly after rain or grit exposure.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L191-L191】
5. **Identify controller silicon before flashing.** New Xiaomi ESCs use GD32 MCUs; flashing STM firmware bricks them, so zoom in on chip markings and grab the GD image set before running ST-Link recoveries.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L95680-L95780】
6. **Secure accessory power taps.** Dashboards only expose 5 V logic—drive headlights and horns from a dedicated DC/DC converter, tie the output wires to the board with RTV, and route the harness away from moving stems so the leads do not fatigue.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L28-L32】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L31-L32】
7. **Reflow noisy balance taps.** JK smart boards throw alternating “short circuit” and “low voltage” alarms when a single balance lead lifts—re-solder any suspect tap before blaming firmware or swapping the BMS.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L650-L650】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L690-L690】
7. **Trace weak 5 V accessory ports back to the buck converter.** A Max G30 plug that still shows 5 V but no current usually means a failed converter stage—follow the trace with a multimeter until you reach the DC/DC module and verify components between it and the port before ordering a replacement board.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L110038-L110041】
8. **Refinish soldered connectors, don’t patch corroded XT60s.** R3VOLT’s refresh reminded the crew to swap oxidised housings entirely, heat the bullet—not the wire—so solder flows, and slide the molded cover back over the last few millimetres before heat-shrinking insulation to prevent shorts.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L84-L84】
9. **Use drilling jigs when precision holes matter.** Off-the-shelf square-hole guides keep controller and bracket installs tidy for builders who struggle to drill straight freehand.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L97-L97】
10. **Prefer controlled hand crimpers for JST signal pins.** Manual “non-ratcheting” tools let you feel the conductor and insulation wings seat properly—ratcheting jaws kept crushing insulation and hiding bad contacts on MP2/75100 harnesses until the team switched tools.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L83-L83】
11. **Match connector families on MakerX harnesses.** The 75100 V2 signal looms use JST-PH (2.0 mm) shells rather than larger JST-XH housings—order the right housings and dies before recrimping.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L84-L84】

## Controller & Motor Tests
- **Continuity sweep before power-up:** With the battery unplugged, probe between B+ / B− and each motor phase. Any reading below ~50 Ω signals a shorted MOSFET that must be replaced before reconnecting cells.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L37-L38】
- **Front-burnout postmortem workflow:** If a VESC dies mid-burnout, meter the QS8 battery connector and each phase to ground in buzzer mode—any tone confirms shorted MOSFETs. Verify the hub still spins freely to rule out a seized motor, then plan a matched-set MOSFET swap using proper hot-air or hot-plate gear; aluminum boards are notoriously hard to rework and you cannot mix spare FETs across controllers. Keep mechanical brakes functional because regen-only setups leave you helpless when the controller faults.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part010.txt†L11412-L11459】
- **Hall sensor alignment:** Preserve the original spacing when replacing hall ICs—swapping long packages for short ones costs roughly 10 km/h, and forgetting isolation pads risks shorting MOSFETs to the case.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L40-L41】
- **Warm-motor hall detection:** If a scooter clonks off the line, rerun manual hall detection with the motor warm and phase current around 70 A—Mirono’s G30 build stopped stuttering immediately after re-detecting on a full battery.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L18463-L18495】
- **Sensorless sanity check:** When tuning sensorless profiles, unplug the hall harness and rerun detection to avoid mixed inputs—builders chasing intermittent faults cleared them the moment the halls were removed during detection.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L646-L646】
- **Graph phase current for MOSFET health.** VESC Tool’s phase-current traces flag dead drivers immediately—a blown DRV forced one controller into noisy BLDC-only operation and shut down above ~10 % throttle until the failed MOSFETs were replaced.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L744-L751】
- **DRV fault symptoms:** Loud BLDC-only operation that vanishes after recalibrating FOC points to a past DRV overcurrent, whereas persistent noise after recalibration usually means the DRV chip is dead—treat the symptom set as a hardware tell before reflashing endlessly.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L647-L647】
- **Wheelway sensor QA:** Replacement Wheelway boards keep shipping with mismatched SS41/SS43 halls; bench-test each sensor at 5 V before sealing the hub and keep a sensorless profile ready in case the new board desyncs within the first 20 km.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L21687-L21726】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L21783-L21888】
- **Isolate flaky hall looms.** A Trampa MK6 that rebooted on throttle stopped crashing the moment the hall loom was unplugged—rerun diagnostics sensorless to confirm the loom or PCB is shorting before replacing the controller.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L21535-L21684】
- **Compare controller hall reports on dual drives.** A mismatched hall sensor left one controller detecting 160 A motor current while the mate read 144 A, upsetting traction until the weak sensor was replaced—verify both controllers report identical idle and detection values before blaming firmware math.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L13-L13】
- **Short phases to count magnets.** When you need the magnet count without cracking the hub, short any two phases together and spin the wheel—the number of detents equals the magnet tally for VESC Tool setup.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L105-L105】
- **ADC overrides block bench tests.** Enabling ADC control stops manual FWD/REV overrides in VESC Tool; switch the control app to UART or disable ADC when you need to spin motors on the stand.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L144-L144】
- **Chase hall loom faults before phases.** Burned or waterlogged hall harnesses can mimic loose phase leads—try sensorless mode or rewire halls before assuming a shorted phase stack.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L145-L145】
- **Sensorless launches still need momentum.** Hall-less 75100 builds require a push start for zero-speed torque, and smoothness varies by motor—keep at least one hall-equipped axle in dual setups for reliable takeoffs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L177-L177】
- **Check for missing phases.** If the scooter brakes when you blip the throttle and only creeps at 20 A, inspect every phase lead and hall orientation—one loose phase on a Wheelway build created identical symptoms until the harness was reseated.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L649-L649】
- **Kelly KLS quirks.** Expect USB drivers to fail on modern Windows; plan on the BLE module or legacy Windows XP tools when configuring scooters running KLS hardware.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L635-L635】
- **Phase-current ceilings as diagnostics.** Dual Spintend riders treat 120–130 A phase per motor (≈160 A ABS) as normal; stuttering above ~85 A points to blown MOSFETs or loose phase leads, so log traces and rerun hall/sensorless tests before simply dropping current limits.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L663-L664】
- **Data-line triage after regen faults:** Error 21 that appears immediately after an emergency stop usually points to a cooked controller data line. Bench-test the pack on a known-good scooter or send it in rather than reflashing firmware blindly.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L368-L369】
- **Backfeed with care:** A depleted 44 V pack can be nudged awake with a 36 V charger only when its open-circuit voltage sits under ~41 V. Anything higher risks over-voltage damage once the charger’s CV phase kicks in.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L37-L38】
- **Log Rita/Happy current spikes:** Error 39 beeps and thermal cutbacks appear when firmware demands exceed Rita’s ~30 A ceiling; capture live amps with m365Tools before dialing tuning back.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L55-L57】
- **Calibrate controller voltage sensors.** Spintend Ubox reports have skewed low by ~3 V until owners compared readings against trusted multimeters (e.g., UNI-T UT123C) and adjusted ADC scaling after new installs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L541-L542】

## Performance Logging & Calibration
- **Acceleration tests:** Use Dragy or Race Timer to record repeated 0–70 km/h pulls, filming the dash at 60 fps and averaging matching-direction runs so GPS lag doesn’t skew results.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L133-L133】
- **Speedometer alignment:** Measure wheel circumference under rider load, set accurate pole counts, and bias VESC telemetry slightly above GPS speed so commuters get an early warning before hitting legal caps.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L134-L134】
- **Magnet count discipline:** Enter the actual magnet count (not pole pairs) and the compressed tyre diameter in VESC Tool—GPS traces lag too much for launch tuning compared with controller RPM telemetry.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L326-L328】
- **Log during tests:** VESCs only store faults while a client is connected; keep xmatic or VESC Tool running on shakedowns so overcurrent or BMS events are captured before power-cycling.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L381-L381】

## Field Recovery Tricks
- **Wake sleeping packs:** Happy BMS batteries ship dormant—tap them with a charger to enable the discharge MOSFETs before chasing wiring faults.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L376-L376】
- **Revive latched Happy BMS boards.** After reconnecting a pack, some Happy BMS units keep discharge off until they see the charger—expect to “tickle” the pack briefly before the controller wakes.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L301-L302】
- **Reconnect stubborn externals:** If Rita “ghosts” an auxiliary pack, blip the throttle for a second to force rediscovery before tearing down wiring.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L209-L210】
- **Time full charges when vetting replacements:** Stock Xiaomi bricks add ≈1.7 Ah per hour; a legitimate 12 Ah Pro 2 pack should need nearly seven hours from empty, so a “full” light in 90 minutes signals a counterfeit pack.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L230-L231】
- **Probe every series group on dead packs:** When a fresh build refuses to wake, crack the wrap and meter each group—bypassing the BMS is for testing only because running without it is a fire risk.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L121801-L121804】
- **Go sensorless when halls fail.** If a Zero or similar scooter loses hall sensors mid-ride, drop open-loop ERPM to 0, switch to the Mxlemming observer with BEMF decoupling, and limp home on sensorless starts; the same approach rescued a loom-burned build once halls were suspect and kept a G30 rider mobile after a severed hall lead.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L403-L404】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L145-L145】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L176-L176】
- **Recover CAN chains through the survivor.** Change the remaining controller’s VESC ID and reflash the bootloader over the intact CAN link to revive dead peers before opening sealed housings.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L404-L404】

## Chassis & Suspension Quick Fixes
- **Rebuild sloppy folding clamps:** Shim ovalized bushings with thin metal or heat-shrink and lock every fastener with threadlocker so the top plate stops wallowing out mid-ride.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L54-L54】
- **Replace washer stacks with bushings.** Jamaludin’s refreshed Nami rode quieter and braked cleaner after swapping improvised washer stacks for machined bushings, rechecking cable routing, and realigning calipers before delivery.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L137-L137】
- **Inspect early Nami frames for cracks.** Spain’s community contrasted first-gen weld failures with reinforced 72/40 updates—use their photos as a checklist before buying used frames.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L138-L138】
- **Tune cheap steering dampers:** Swap generic damper fluid for 10W/60 shock oil or Citroën LHM+ to regain adjustability without chewing seals, especially on freebie take-offs.[^damper-oil]
- **Favor suspended frames for high-power conversions:** Ninebot Max G2 chassis with suspension outlast rigid G30 decks under vibration, SNSC rental frames survive high-speed crashes with minimal damage, and DNM shock/13"×7" tire combos plus lever-free hub tire removals keep service visits efficient.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L316-L316】

## Hardware & Fastener Rescue
- **Free rounded Thunder hardware.** Cut a slot with a Dremel or rotary tool, hammer in an oversized flat-head (“Thor head”) bit, or heat the screw to break the Loctite before extraction—these tricks keep swingarms and deck plates serviceable without drilling the frame.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L220-L223】
- **Confirm motor orientation before detection.** Unplugging phases for service doesn’t require a fresh motor detection—miswired phases simply spin backwards, so fix wiring before rerunning the wizard.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L231-L233】
- **Flip Segway’s “new motor” flag after swaps.** Color-matching G30 phase leads still works across model years, but newer firmware won’t spin until you toggle the new-motor flag—note it in your service checklist.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L360-L360】
- **Lean on Ortega observers for stuttering launches.** 75 200 builds that lock under hard throttle smooth out once the Ortega observer replaces mxlemming—note it as the go-to fix before chasing hardware faults.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L374-L374】
- **Reset CAN IDs before assuming transceiver failure.** If dual stacks refuse to sync, change CAN IDs in VESC Tool and reboot both controllers—Figiwara’s crew fixes most “dead” pairs this way before opening the hardware.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L397-L399】

## Deck Swaps & Packaging Checks
- **Thunder deck on Victor frames.** Skrtt transplanted a Thunder deck box onto a Dualtron Victor for extra battery room; the Victor mounts share the Thunder’s 7.5 cm spacing and cost roughly €200, avoiding custom machining.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L224-L228】
- **Plan swingarm upgrades for 11" hubs.** Thunder swingarms remain the go-to for squeezing 70 H or 11" motors onto Victors, while builders can run 11" tires first if they grind minor fork contact points and seat axles at the dropout tips for clearance checks.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L228-L233】
- **Order GT rims without new hubs.** Skrtt confirmed AliExpress “rim only” listings fit worn GT-series motors, but inspect the hub carefully before reusing magnets and halls.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L348-L348】
- **Stock axle hardware.** Konyk conversion kits still include matching axle nuts, simplifying rear motor swaps when OEM hardware is discontinued—add spares to the field kit.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L349-L349】

## Tire & Traction Observations
- **Stock alternatives to PMT slicks.** Xeuancheng and ULIP 11″ tires work as PMT stand-ins when shipping falters—expect minor brake-mount trimming on some frames and grab extras when discounts pop up.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L111-L111】
- **NAMI track pace sans FW.** Dialed geometry and sticky rubber already push Nami builds near 100 km/h without field weakening—treat FW as optional headroom, not a crutch.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L112-L112】
- **Burnouts destroy budget slicks.** Continuous burnouts in 48 °C heat shredded “snake” tread street tires, nudging riders back to PMT Juniors or at least frequent rotations before cords appear.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L184-L184】
- **Prep beads before sealing.** Slow leaks and reseat headaches traced back to leftover mold flash and embedded debris—scuff beads clean and inspect carcasses before final inflation.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L185-L185】
- **Skid-test 90/65-6.5 clones before trusting them.** Veterans force a burnout: nylon clones squeal loudly while real rubber heats up and feels sticky—reject any tire that fails the test before high-speed runs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L368-L368】
- **6.5" sourcing is inconsistent.** Options range from questionable PMT “Stardale” clones to TOUVT 100/55-6.5 casings, while Xuancheng PMTs remain the favourite despite recent 50 % price hikes on AliExpress—stock extras when prices dip.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L234-L239】
- **Use quality sealant first.** Muc-Off tubeless formula handles most slow leaks via the valve core; stubborn punctures still need tubes or patches after inspecting the carcass for debris.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L240-L242】
- **Patches outlast multi-plug repairs.** Matthew prefers internal patches for longevity, though Noname notes multi-plug off-road fixes can hold for years; everyone agrees to scuff the casing and let cement tack before bonding.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L242-L246】
- **Burnout smoke depends on build.** Tread compound, wheel speed, and chassis weight dictate smoke output—lighter 6.5" builds shed less rubber than heavy Weped-style setups unless using gimmick “gender reveal” compounds.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L246-L248】
- **Treat valve cores as consumables.** Tubeless conversions keep spares on hand because damaged cores or rushed cement work reopen leaks until replaced and fully cured.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L248-L250】
- **Balance electronics with mechanics:** Traction control helps rein front-wheel slip up to ~55 mph, but riders still cut front phase amps to keep dual-drive scooters manageable in launches.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L74-L74】
- **Match tires to power levels:** Xuancheng 12" slicks stay budget-friendly but spin under hard launches, so high-power builds migrate to CST or PMT rubber; on 6" rims, Tuovt 90/55-6 casings grip better than CST 90/65-6 while oversized 6.5" skins pinch split rims and look sloppy.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L75-L78】
- **Pick tires for the surface, not hype:** Riders are steering 10" Zero/Vsett owners toward CST 10×3 or PMT 10×3.5 rubber, calling Xuancheng slicks short-lived above 4 kW without traction control, and leaning on Tuovt 90/55-6 for broken pavement longevity.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L348-L350】
- **Address pinch flats proactively:** Vsett 9 owners fighting split-rim pinch flats now double heavy-duty Ulip tubes, dust them with baby powder during install, and experiment with 3D-printed bead covers to protect the tube crease.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L79-L79】
- **Source tires regionally but plan spares.** ULIP 90/60‑6 clones remain the affordable standby when PMT Juniors hit ~€130 locally, yet riders still prefer PMT grip when shipping behaves—stock extras before the next shortage.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L36-L36】
- **Budget for CNC rims and wider axles.** Ambrosini/LY 6.5" rims still land around €100–€120 each and expect 155 mm+ axles plus chunky AWG 7–8 phase sleeves—verify spacing before ordering batches.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L426-L426】
- **Tune pressures to the compound.** Shlomozero still skids the front at 30 psi even with 220 A phase, while French racers drop PMTs to ~14 psi for turn-in grip—log pressures with each tire swap.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L74-L74】

## Security Layers & Theft Response
- Hide GPS trackers along the main harness, combine Rita builds with motion alarms inside the battery bag, and budget a hardened chain for long stops; layered defenses buy recovery time even though determined thieves can still lift a 20 kg scooter.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L896-L896】

## Documentation & Support Habits
- Keep a photo log of connector routing, ST-Link pinouts, and fuse replacements so future technicians can retrace your steps. Denis’ English manual is updated as new edge cases surface—reference it before opening support tickets.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L209-L210】
- Archive VESC Tool logs before sealing decks: Android 11+ hides files under `Android/data/vedder.vesctool/files`, so plan to pull them via TCP bridge or file managers like XFolder after each shakedown.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L3440-L4018】
- **Flash VESC Express over CAN when USB fails.** Builders now power the module over USB for flashing screenshots, then fall back to CAN-only sessions if the USB-C port refuses to enumerate—expect to use the ESP flasher inside VESC Tool and document the station-mode workflow for teammates.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part012.txt†L11592-L11619】

## Mini-Bike & Fiido L3 Conversions
- **Respect the stock controller limits:** Fiido L3 controllers float loose without heatsinks and only deliver ~25 A; jumping straight to 20 S test packs without pre-charging popped factory BMS units. Match pack voltages before connecting higher-voltage VESC hardware.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L381-L381】
- **Dial conservative currents:** After cutting battery current to ~20 A, setting traction control to 20/20 A, and capping phase around 60 A with FW, builders hit 45 km/h and repeatable wheelies without overheating the compact hub.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L382-L382】
- **Plan full teardowns:** Packs are heavily sealed—glued busbars, soldered fasteners, and tripped protection boards left entire parallel groups at 0 V—so refurb projects require full BMS removal rather than capacitor swaps.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L383-L383】

[^damper-oil]: PuneDir’s free steering damper only behaved after switching to lighter fluids; veterans now recommend 10W/60 shock oil or Citroën LHM+ to preserve seals while restoring adjustability.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L56-L56】
