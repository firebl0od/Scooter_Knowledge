# Scooter Diagnostic Toolkit & Field Practices

## Core Instruments
- **Handheld multimeter:** Expect budget meters to ship with 12 V A23 cells and fragile F200 mA fuses—stock replacements and keep a sturdier backup such as the Mustool MT111 on hand for daily troubleshooting.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L164-L164】
- **Cell testing bench:** Pair LiitoKala or Opus bays with a 3.3 Ω / 25 W Ohmite resistor block so you can discharge or capacity-test loose 18650s before grouping them into packs, especially when customer batteries arrive full.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L165-L165】
- **Firmware lifeline:** ST-Link V2 programmers remain the fastest recovery path for bricked dashboards, ESCs, and Rita-linked BMS boards—clip onto the pads, flash stock firmware, then resume Bluetooth updates once communications return. Modern Ninebot Max dashboards also demand ST-Link access because recent BLE revisions block OTA downgrades.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L47-L49】【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L166-L166】【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L331-L331】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L103-L104】
- **Low-voltage logging:** Keep Bluetooth thermometers or CR2032-powered loggers in the spares bin when validating experimental packs so you can capture temperature spikes before they cook cells.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L372-L372】
- **Insulation & adhesive supplies:** Stock RTV silicone, Kapton, and zip ties to strain-relieve DC/DC converters and harnesses; vibration snaps converter leads unless they are glued or tied back to the PCB before the scooter ever rolls.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L31-L32】

## Wiring & Harness Checks
1. **Start at the XT30:** After any crash or curb strike, verify the adapter output voltage before chasing other faults; browned phase pins or half-seated BMS harnesses are the most common culprits when scooters power-cycle on bumps.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L195-L195】
2. **Inspect pack protection:** Cheap “25 A” eBay BMS boards routinely trip around 18 A despite balanced cell groups—swap in reputable 20–30 A hardware before blaming Rita or the controller for brownouts.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L172-L172】
3. **Match radio gear:** Immobiliser and alarm kits ship in multiple frequencies; confirm your remote (315 MHz vs. 415 MHz) before hard-wiring to the scooter’s 5 V accessory tap so the system actually arms.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L167-L167】
4. **Treat locks as consumables:** Light cable locks such as compact Master Lock loops work for coffee stops only if they stay lubricated with graphite—dry mechanisms jam quickly after rain or grit exposure.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L191-L191】
5. **Identify controller silicon before flashing.** New Xiaomi ESCs use GD32 MCUs; flashing STM firmware bricks them, so zoom in on chip markings and grab the GD image set before running ST-Link recoveries.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L95680-L95780】
6. **Secure accessory power taps.** Dashboards only expose 5 V logic—drive headlights and horns from a dedicated DC/DC converter, tie the output wires to the board with RTV, and route the harness away from moving stems so the leads do not fatigue.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L28-L32】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L31-L32】
7. **Trace weak 5 V accessory ports back to the buck converter.** A Max G30 plug that still shows 5 V but no current usually means a failed converter stage—follow the trace with a multimeter until you reach the DC/DC module and verify components between it and the port before ordering a replacement board.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L110038-L110041】

## Controller & Motor Tests
- **Continuity sweep before power-up:** With the battery unplugged, probe between B+ / B− and each motor phase. Any reading below ~50 Ω signals a shorted MOSFET that must be replaced before reconnecting cells.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L37-L38】
- **Front-burnout postmortem workflow:** If a VESC dies mid-burnout, meter the QS8 battery connector and each phase to ground in buzzer mode—any tone confirms shorted MOSFETs. Verify the hub still spins freely to rule out a seized motor, then plan a matched-set MOSFET swap using proper hot-air or hot-plate gear; aluminum boards are notoriously hard to rework and you cannot mix spare FETs across controllers. Keep mechanical brakes functional because regen-only setups leave you helpless when the controller faults.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part010.txt†L11412-L11459】
- **Hall sensor alignment:** Preserve the original spacing when replacing hall ICs—swapping long packages for short ones costs roughly 10 km/h, and forgetting isolation pads risks shorting MOSFETs to the case.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L40-L41】
- **Bench-test new hall boards before soldering:** Slack techs keep finding occasional DOA sensors; power the PCB from a lab supply, spin the rotor by hand, and confirm each channel toggles before committing to heatshrink or epoxy.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part010.txt†L11224-L11229】
- **Use high-temperature adhesives on hall plates:** 🇪🇸AYO#74 and lekrsu warned hot glue softens near 120 °C; secure sensors with high-temp silicone or epoxy and recheck alignment so replacement boards stay seated through hub heat cycles.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L135-L137】
- **Cycle VESC temperature presets when readings look wrong:** If motor telemetry is nonsense, walk through the 10 kΩ NTC, 1 kΩ PTC, and 100 kΩ NTC options before condemning the hardware—mis-matched presets are common on third-party looms.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L148-L149】
- **Data-line triage after regen faults:** Error 21 that appears immediately after an emergency stop usually points to a cooked controller data line. Bench-test the pack on a known-good scooter or send it in rather than reflashing firmware blindly.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L368-L369】
- **Backfeed with care:** A depleted 44 V pack can be nudged awake with a 36 V charger only when its open-circuit voltage sits under ~41 V. Anything higher risks over-voltage damage once the charger’s CV phase kicks in.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L37-L38】
- **Log Rita/Happy current spikes:** Error 39 beeps and thermal cutbacks appear when firmware demands exceed Rita’s ~30 A ceiling; capture live amps with m365Tools before dialing tuning back.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L55-L57】

## Field Recovery Tricks
- **Wake sleeping packs:** Happy BMS batteries ship dormant—tap them with a charger to enable the discharge MOSFETs before chasing wiring faults.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L376-L376】
- **Reconnect stubborn externals:** If Rita “ghosts” an auxiliary pack, blip the throttle for a second to force rediscovery before tearing down wiring.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L209-L210】
- **Time full charges when vetting replacements:** Stock Xiaomi bricks add ≈1.7 Ah per hour; a legitimate 12 Ah Pro 2 pack should need nearly seven hours from empty, so a “full” light in 90 minutes signals a counterfeit pack.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L230-L231】
- **Probe every series group on dead packs:** When a fresh build refuses to wake, crack the wrap and meter each group—bypassing the BMS is for testing only because running without it is a fire risk.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L121801-L121804】

## Security Layers & Theft Response
- Hide GPS trackers along the main harness, combine Rita builds with motion alarms inside the battery bag, and budget a hardened chain for long stops; layered defenses buy recovery time even though determined thieves can still lift a 20 kg scooter.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L896-L896】

## Documentation & Support Habits
- Keep a photo log of connector routing, ST-Link pinouts, and fuse replacements so future technicians can retrace your steps. Denis’ English manual is updated as new edge cases surface—reference it before opening support tickets.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L209-L210】
