# Scooter Diagnostic Toolkit & Field Practices

## Core Instruments
- **Handheld multimeter:** Expect budget meters to ship with 12 V A23 cells and fragile F200 mA fuses—stock replacements and keep a sturdier backup such as the Mustool MT111 on hand for daily troubleshooting.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L164-L164】
- **Cell testing bench:** Pair LiitoKala or Opus bays with a 3.3 Ω / 25 W Ohmite resistor block so you can discharge or capacity-test loose 18650s before grouping them into packs, especially when customer batteries arrive full.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L165-L165】
- **Firmware lifeline:** ST-Link V2 programmers remain the fastest recovery path for bricked dashboards, ESCs, and Rita-linked BMS boards—clip onto the pads, flash stock firmware, then resume Bluetooth updates once communications return. Modern Ninebot Max dashboards also demand ST-Link access because recent BLE revisions block OTA downgrades.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L47-L49】【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L166-L166】【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L331-L331】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L103-L104】
- **Express flashing workflow:** Smart Repair now flashes VESC Express modules by powering them over USB alone, picking the COM port inside the ESP Programmer panel, and only then reconnecting CAN; if a controller’s USB-C port dies you can still stream live data over CAN/BLE, but configuration changes require a direct USB session to the ESC.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L228-L231】
- **Windows installer caveat:** VESC Tool 6.05 packages still fail to launch on some Windows machines even though the build runs under Ubuntu—ship dependency notes or known workarounds with the binaries so support doesn’t stall at install time.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6354-L6356】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6483-L6490】
- **Low-voltage logging:** Keep Bluetooth thermometers or CR2032-powered loggers in the spares bin when validating experimental packs so you can capture temperature spikes before they cook cells.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L372-L372】
- **High-precision GPS.** Dragy’s DRG70 bumps to a 10th-gen u-blox receiver with tighter accuracy but its magnetic mount won’t grab anodised aluminium stems—budget steel inserts or adhesive plates before track days and consider 3D-printed steel-backed clamps for VSETT stems.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L153-L155】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part004.txt†L4101-L4132】
- **AC milliohm meter:** Industry-standard 1 kHz testers like the YR1035+ expose weak cells quickly even if readings differ from DC load checks—ideal for sorting cells before pack assembly.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L206-L206】
- **LCR-T4 component tester:** Handy for confirming MOSFETs, caps, and diodes on suspect VESC boards when DC readings look off—builders caught 1–2 V voltage-sense drift and shorted drivers before reinstalling hardware.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part005.txt†L23147-L23160】
- **PlatformIO build environment:** The aging VescUart Arduino libraries compile reliably under PlatformIO (Nano/Pro Mini profiles); the stock Arduino IDE often misses dependencies for custom dashboards. Use the PlatformIO quick-start from the VESC telemetry display project to clone configs, flash boards, and share binaries quickly.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L261-L261】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part004.txt†L12626-L12646】
- **VESC Tool mobile update workflow:** Back up motor/app XMLs before flashing in the Android/iOS app, use the in-app firmware flasher while the pack is connected, and sideload older APKs if 6.0+ releases hide configuration menus—the crew now keeps a rollback archive specifically for field recoveries.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part004.txt†L12073-L12089】
- **Use the mobile app for live ADC checks.** VESC Tool’s smartphone build still exposes RT data and ADC mapping panels—connect over TCP, Wi-Fi, or USB to watch throttle and brake voltages without digging through hidden menus.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L344-L344】
- **Insulation & adhesive supplies:** Stock RTV silicone, Kapton, and zip ties to strain-relieve DC/DC converters and harnesses; vibration snaps converter leads unless they are glued or tied back to the PCB before the scooter ever rolls.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L31-L32】
- **Instant translation:** Plus Messenger’s built-in translator lets techs follow Spanish- and French-language repair chats without copy-paste gymnastics—handy when sourcing parts from multinational groups.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L1665-L1689】
- **Dedicated GPS logger:** Relive overstates peak speed by ~7 km/h when GPS drops, so shops now run Speed View GPS Pro for floating dashboards, exportable logs, and reliable range data alongside VESC telemetry.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L6003-L6013】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L6414-L6436】
- **Retire sketchy refurbished chargers.** A “Meanwell” fast charger with loose add-on circuitry and cold solder joints tripped RCDs and died outright—budget for genuine 22 S-capable supplies even if they cost €200+ rather than gambling on rebuilds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part004.txt†L9300-L9374】
- **Background-safe VESC logging:** Field tests confirmed VESC Tool keeps writing logs while the Android app sits in the background, letting technicians foreground GPS overlays or camera apps during top-speed runs without losing controller data; just reconnect afterward to pull the files.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L256-L257】
- **Quarter-inch impact driver discipline:** Keep 1/4" hex impacts for gentle screw spinning with impact-rated sockets and a light trigger; avoid split-rim bolts, tapping threads, or hammering hardware you care about because the percussion shatters taps and fasteners.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15566-L15585】

## Wiring & Harness Checks
1. **Start at the XT30:** After any crash or curb strike, verify the adapter output voltage before chasing other faults; browned phase pins or half-seated BMS harnesses are the most common culprits when scooters power-cycle on bumps.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L195-L195】
2. **Inspect pack protection:** Cheap “25 A” eBay BMS boards routinely trip around 18 A despite balanced cell groups—swap in reputable 20–30 A hardware before blaming Rita or the controller for brownouts.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L172-L172】
3. **Match radio gear:** Immobiliser and alarm kits ship in multiple frequencies; confirm your remote (315 MHz vs. 415 MHz) before hard-wiring to the scooter’s 5 V accessory tap so the system actually arms.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L167-L167】
4. **Treat locks as consumables:** Light cable locks such as compact Master Lock loops work for coffee stops only if they stay lubricated with graphite—dry mechanisms jam quickly after rain or grit exposure.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L191-L191】
5. **Identify controller silicon before flashing.** New Xiaomi ESCs use GD32 MCUs; flashing STM firmware bricks them, so zoom in on chip markings and grab the GD image set before running ST-Link recoveries.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L95680-L95780】
6. **Secure accessory power taps.** Dashboards only expose 5 V logic—drive headlights and horns from a dedicated DC/DC converter, tie the output wires to the board with RTV, and route the harness away from moving stems so the leads do not fatigue.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L28-L32】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L31-L32】
7. **Reflow noisy balance taps.** JK smart boards throw alternating “short circuit” and “low voltage” alarms when a single balance lead lifts—re-solder any suspect tap before blaming firmware or swapping the BMS.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L650-L650】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L690-L690】
7. **Trace weak 5 V accessory ports back to the buck converter.** A Max G30 plug that still shows 5 V but no current usually means a failed converter stage—follow the trace with a multimeter until you reach the DC/DC module and verify components between it and the port before ordering a replacement board.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L110038-L110041】
8. **Refinish soldered connectors, don’t patch corroded XT60s.** R3VOLT’s refresh reminded the crew to swap oxidised housings entirely, heat the bullet—not the wire—so solder flows, and slide the molded cover back over the last few millimetres before heat-shrinking insulation to prevent shorts.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L84-L84】
9. **Use drilling jigs when precision holes matter.** Off-the-shelf square-hole guides keep controller and bracket installs tidy for builders who struggle to drill straight freehand.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L97-L97】
- **Step drills for control hardware.** Enlarging round switch holes stays cleanest with step bits, while rectangular cut-outs still need files or nibblers; finish with a hand ratchet on axle nuts to feel clamp load instead of hammering them with an impact.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L19023-L19038】
- **Throttle extensions hold up.** Two-metre throttle runs on quality silicone cable have stayed noise-free, so shielded loom is optional for most scooters.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L7164-L7185】
- **Parallel smaller leads when space is tight.** Doubling up 12 AWG silicone wire handled ~80 A battery current on GABE’s compact pack, making parallel runs a workable compromise when harness routing is constrained.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6581-L6584】
- **Inspect anti-spark connectors periodically.** Noname spotted the precharge strip inside an XT90S-style plug browning after repeated use—retire housings that show discoloration or heat damage before they melt during high-current launches.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20442-L20448】

## Controller & Motor Tests
- Hall sensor PCBs vary by scooter—spacing, voltage, and middle-sensor types change—so don’t expect universal replacements when diagnosing dead Reid/Boost motors or throttle faults.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L162-L162】
- **Continuity sweep before power-up:** With the battery unplugged, probe between B+ / B− and each motor phase. Any reading below ~50 Ω signals a shorted MOSFET that must be replaced before reconnecting cells.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L37-L38】
- **Start with the low-voltage rails on “dead” VESCs.** Before condemning a no-power controller, check every LDO regulator and supply rail with a meter; technicians now solder test pigtails or use current-limited supplies so a slipped probe does not vaporise PCB traces during the investigation.[^ldo_probe]
- **Meter controller rails before blaming accessories.** Ubox V2 troubleshooting now starts with the 12 V rail—if it sags or reads open, chase the controller before condemning lights or pumps.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L108-L108】
- **Front-burnout postmortem workflow:** If a VESC dies mid-burnout, meter the QS8 battery connector and each phase to ground in buzzer mode—any tone confirms shorted MOSFETs. Verify the hub still spins freely to rule out a seized motor, then plan a matched-set MOSFET swap using proper hot-air or hot-plate gear; aluminum boards are notoriously hard to rework and you cannot mix spare FETs across controllers. Keep mechanical brakes functional because regen-only setups leave you helpless when the controller faults.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part010.txt†L11412-L11459】
- **Cycle temp presets before condemning sensors.** NetworkDir clears bogus VESC temperature telemetry by stepping through the 10 kΩ NTC, 1 kΩ PTC, and 100 kΩ NTC presets—if readings stay wrong after the sweep, chase wiring faults before blaming hardware.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part010.txt†L9579-L9586】
- **Hall sensor alignment:** Preserve the original spacing when replacing hall ICs—swapping long packages for short ones costs roughly 10 km/h, and forgetting isolation pads risks shorting MOSFETs to the case.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L40-L41】
- **Warm-motor hall detection:** If a scooter clonks off the line, rerun manual hall detection with the motor warm and phase current around 70 A—Mirono’s G30 build stopped stuttering immediately after re-detecting on a full battery.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L18463-L18495】
- **Clean contaminated mid-drives methodically.** Blow debris out with compressed air first, then spot-clean windings and PCBs with brake cleaner or isopropyl on lint-free cloths—avoid microfiber that sheds fibres and be gentle around magnet glue and adhesives.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L49-L51】
- **Sensorless sanity check:** When tuning sensorless profiles, unplug the hall harness and rerun detection to avoid mixed inputs—builders chasing intermittent faults cleared them the moment the halls were removed during detection.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L646-L646】
- **Graph phase current for MOSFET health.** VESC Tool’s phase-current traces flag dead drivers immediately—a blown DRV forced one controller into noisy BLDC-only operation and shut down above ~10 % throttle until the failed MOSFETs were replaced.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L744-L751】
- **Keep Vedder’s `code_server` for CAN telemetry.** Riders still trust it over legacy scripts so long as firmware stays current and they capture logs during faults for later review.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L109-L109】
- **Quick hall re-detection:** 🇪🇸AYO#74 confirmed you can rerun hall detection without a full motor calibration, but remember to disable the VESC Tool hand-test once inputs check out or throttle/brake channels stay latched in test mode.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L38-L40】
- **SmartESC UI caveat:** NetworkDir reminded riders that Xiaomi SmartESC firmware only mimics the VESC Tool interface—it does not run VESC code—so treat its readouts as cosmetic and keep real tuning in VESC Tool.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L38-L39】
- **Tame vibration by re-detecting inductance.** 🇪🇸AYO#74 cured a persistent shudder by trimming detected inductance from ~22.5 µH to 16–17 µH, re-running VSS sensorless tuning, and restoring settings from the VESC mobile app’s onboard backups—useful for iPhone users without laptops on hand.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L255-L255】
- **Chase vibrations methodically:** When Yamal reported front-motor scraping, 🇪🇸AYO#74 first checked the dash swap (Ortega vs. stock) and ultimately found a vibrating phone mount—rule out accessories before tearing hubs apart.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L299-L300】
- **DRV fault symptoms:** Loud BLDC-only operation that vanishes after recalibrating FOC points to a past DRV overcurrent, whereas persistent noise after recalibration usually means the DRV chip is dead—treat the symptom set as a hardware tell before reflashing endlessly.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L647-L647】
- **Finish Makerbase wizard runs on a PC.** Android app wizards hide throttle/brake assignments; the group now saves configs in desktop VESC Tool, resolves 75_300_R2 hardware-ID mismatches, and flashes Izuna’s firmware for accurate 75100 voltage readings once the controller enumerates correctly.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part002.txt†L27369-L27428】
- **Verify magnet strength with a Gauss meter.** Rewound hub projects now include handheld Gauss checks after re-magnetising stators so you can confirm field strength before sealing the motor.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L19004-L19009】
- **Log the Flipsky blue-LED unbrick steps.** One 75100 stayed locked on a blue LED despite ST-Link attempts—document the SWD recovery workflow so the next repair isn’t a fresh science project.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L7995-L7995】
- **Read before writing over CAN.** When tuning ADC or throttle settings through a master controller, hit `Read` first so VESC Tool doesn’t clone the same ID across both nodes and strand the CAN bus.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L93-L93】
- **Set wheel data on every controller.** Enter wheel diameter, pole count, and gear ratio on both VESCs so paired dashboards report the same speed during bench tests.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L96-L96】
- **Pull CAN jumpers while changing IDs.** Remove termination jumpers when reassigning addresses; leaving them connected lets both controllers grab the same ID and appear “dead.”【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L97-L97】
- **Wire CAN before applying power.** Plug the CAN harness in before energising the controllers—booting them first left Shlomo’s pair invisible until the link was connected and IDs were resynced.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L99-L99】
- **ABS over-current noise sometimes just needs a higher ceiling.** Alex cleared repeated ABS warnings by raising the Max ABS Current in VESC Tool—log regen-heavy tunes before swapping hardware.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L194-L197】
- **Rerun detection if resistance numbers look wrong.** A Zero 10X hub that overheated on modest 30 A battery / 70 A phase / 20 A FW tunes reported 172 mΩ instead of the normal ~40 mΩ—rerun detection on trusted hardware before drilling cooling holes.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L11001-L11010】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L11223-L11262】
- **Wheelway sensor QA:** Replacement Wheelway boards keep shipping with mismatched SS41/SS43 halls; bench-test each sensor at 5 V before sealing the hub and keep a sensorless profile ready in case the new board desyncs within the first 20 km.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L21687-L21726】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L21783-L21888】
- **Isolate mixed-brand CAN issues.** MakerBase and Flipsky clones rarely share a healthy CAN bus—swap to known-good JST-PH/XHB harnesses and log each controller independently before condemning hardware.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L22032-L22103】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L24174-L24355】
- **Isolate flaky hall looms.** A Trampa MK6 that rebooted on throttle stopped crashing the moment the hall loom was unplugged—rerun diagnostics sensorless to confirm the loom or PCB is shorting before replacing the controller.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L21535-L21684】
- **Check for missing phases.** If the scooter brakes when you blip the throttle and only creeps at 20 A, inspect every phase lead and hall orientation—one loose phase on a Wheelway build created identical symptoms until the harness was reseated.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L649-L649】
- **Kelly KLS quirks.** Expect USB drivers to fail on modern Windows; plan on the BLE module or legacy Windows XP tools when configuring scooters running KLS hardware.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L635-L635】
- **Phase-current ceilings as diagnostics.** Dual Spintend riders treat 120–130 A phase per motor (≈160 A ABS) as normal; stuttering above ~85 A points to blown MOSFETs or loose phase leads, so log traces and rerun hall/sensorless tests before simply dropping current limits.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L663-L664】
- **3Shul ABS fixes need manual detection.** CL350 V4 owners cleared ABS overcurrent faults by rerunning detection with a 500 µs timing step, switching from `mxlemming` to the Ortega observer, and dialing the tune in manually per Vedder’s demos.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L17692-L17699】
- **Data-line triage after regen faults:** Error 21 that appears immediately after an emergency stop usually points to a cooked controller data line. Bench-test the pack on a known-good scooter or send it in rather than reflashing firmware blindly.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L368-L369】
- **Backfeed with care:** A depleted 44 V pack can be nudged awake with a 36 V charger only when its open-circuit voltage sits under ~41 V. Anything higher risks over-voltage damage once the charger’s CV phase kicks in.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L37-L38】
- **Log Rita/Happy current spikes:** Error 39 beeps and thermal cutbacks appear when firmware demands exceed Rita’s ~30 A ceiling; capture live amps with m365Tools before dialing tuning back.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L55-L57】
- **Calibrate controller voltage sensors.** Spintend Ubox reports have skewed low by ~3 V until owners compared readings against trusted multimeters (e.g., UNI-T UT123C) and adjusted ADC scaling after new installs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L541-L542】
- **Seal vulnerable USB-C cutouts.** Water intrusion through exposed controller USB-C ports has already spoofed temperature telemetry; relocate the connector internally and silicone the original opening before returning the scooter to service.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L259-L260】

## Performance Logging & Calibration
- **Acceleration tests:** Use Dragy or Race Timer to record repeated 0–70 km/h pulls, filming the dash at 60 fps and averaging matching-direction runs so GPS lag doesn’t skew results.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L133-L133】
- **Export pack sag logs:** Pull CSV/XLS files from VESC Tool after hill climbs or heavy regen sessions so you can quantify voltage drop before raising current limits or rewiring parallel packs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L301-L301】
- **Benchmark sprint claims with Dragy.** The group still treats Dragy GPS modules as the trusted reference when validating AWD launches or top-speed runs, so capture their CAN-aligned logs before publishing numbers.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L26407-L26482】
- **Cross-check GPS overlays.** One 200 A test logged a 7 km discrepancy between a phone overlay and the VESC dash; export the VESC log as the ground truth whenever overlays disagree to avoid publishing inflated speed claims.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L257-L258】
- **Child-friendly profiles:** Use VESC Tool’s Profiles tab to scale Max Current down (≈60 % cuts one rider’s scooter to ~5 mph) while keeping smooth launches for training sessions.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10073-L10087】
- **Speedometer alignment:** Measure wheel circumference under rider load, set accurate pole counts, and bias VESC telemetry slightly above GPS speed so commuters get an early warning before hitting legal caps.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L134-L134】
- **Mantis circumference baseline:** Builders running 10″ Mantis hubs log VESC Tool wheel circumference around 253–254 mm, with 254 mm reading 3–5 km/h high—handy for quick GPS cross-checks.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15504-L15522】
- **Keep traction-control data honest.** NetworkDir recommends enabling traction control—or at least matching pole, gear, and tyre values across CAN nodes—so slipping front wheels don’t inflate dash speed beyond GPS reality.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L13108-L13115】
- **Cross-check GPS logs:** 🇪🇸AYO#74’s ~140 km/h Nami runs highlighted how GoPro GPS can fail in tunnels—export Relive.cc or similar telemetry to validate hyper-scooter data and benchmark other builds like Face de Pin Sucé’s 22 S9 P Samsung 50S / LY 75H log.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L249-L251】
- **Re-measure wheel OD after tire swaps:** Correcting diameter from 271 mm to 279.4 mm tightened 🇪🇸AYO#74’s speed telemetry, proving a few millimetres of drift can skew GPS/odometer comparisons.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L252-L252】
- **Magnet count discipline:** Enter the actual magnet count (not pole pairs) and the compressed tyre diameter in VESC Tool—GPS traces lag too much for launch tuning compared with controller RPM telemetry.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L326-L328】
- **Validate pole counts after repairs.** A mis-set 30-pole value made NetworkDir’s GT2RS display 165 km/h when GPS confirmed ~120 km/h on 40-pole hubs—double-check counts before bragging about top speed.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L19199-L19203】
- **Confirm hub windings with proper instrumentation.** LY motors often share castings—either open the stator or measure phase resistance with a four-wire milliohm meter such as the YR1035+; a genuine 75 H 22×3 is unlikely to top 120 km/h without heavy FW, which helps sanity-check “33×2” shipments.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L384-L384】
- **Log during tests:** VESCs only store faults while a client is connected; keep xmatic or VESC Tool running on shakedowns so overcurrent or BMS events are captured before power-cycling.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L381-L381】
- **Pair dashboards with matching firmware.** Dual-VESC conversions on G30 or Mantis frames share one dash over CAN; mixing a stock G30 controller with a lone VESC stays “the jankiest” fix until you flash community firmware on both units so VESC Tool recognises them cleanly.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L265-L266】
- **Characterise shunt mods with a bench supply.** Paolo walks builders through feeding the controller from a current-limited bench supply, measuring millivolt drop across the shunt, and using Ohm’s law instead of trusting hobby meters when recalculating resistance.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L380-L380】

## Field Recovery Tricks
- **Wake sleeping packs:** Happy BMS batteries ship dormant—tap them with a charger to enable the discharge MOSFETs before chasing wiring faults.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L376-L376】
- **Revive latched Happy BMS boards.** After reconnecting a pack, some Happy BMS units keep discharge off until they see the charger—expect to “tickle” the pack briefly before the controller wakes.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L301-L302】
- **Reconnect stubborn externals:** If Rita “ghosts” an auxiliary pack, blip the throttle for a second to force rediscovery before tearing down wiring.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L209-L210】
- **Time full charges when vetting replacements:** Stock Xiaomi bricks add ≈1.7 Ah per hour; a legitimate 12 Ah Pro 2 pack should need nearly seven hours from empty, so a “full” light in 90 minutes signals a counterfeit pack.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L230-L231】
- **Probe every series group on dead packs:** When a fresh build refuses to wake, crack the wrap and meter each group—bypassing the BMS is for testing only because running without it is a fire risk.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L121801-L121804】
- **Tighten loose bullet plugs without damage.** Medhi wedges a sliver of hard plastic into the female bullet to flare the contact gently, restoring grip without gouging the connector bore.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L381-L381】
- **Go sensorless when halls fail.** If a Zero or similar scooter loses hall sensors mid-ride, drop open-loop ERPM to 0, switch to the Mxlemming observer with BEMF decoupling, and limp home on sensorless starts.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L403-L404】
- **Recover CAN chains through the survivor.** Change the remaining controller’s VESC ID and reflash the bootloader over the intact CAN link to revive dead peers before opening sealed housings.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L404-L404】

## Connectivity & Firmware Utilities
- Pair an ESP32-C3 with a CAN daughterboard running VESC Express when you need Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, logging, and GPS without relying on ageing NRF dongles.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L350-L351】
- Salvaged Segway G30 dashboards flashed with VESC NRF firmware work as low-cost wireless bridges for fresh builds—keep donor boards on hand for budget diagnostics.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L351-L352】
- Ofek’s “kick start” script disables motor output below a set speed (~1 m/s by default), giving commuters a push-to-start safety layer when throttle-only launches are risky.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L353-L353】

## Chassis & Suspension Quick Fixes
- **Rebuild sloppy folding clamps:** Shim ovalized bushings with thin metal or heat-shrink and lock every fastener with threadlocker so the top plate stops wallowing out mid-ride.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L54-L54】
- **Silence Vsett 10+ hub clunks:** Loud knocks between braking and throttle almost always trace to loose axles or missing hub washers after bearing swaps—retorque hardware and add proper torque washers/arms before chasing controller faults.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L16-L16】
- **Tune cheap steering dampers:** Swap generic damper fluid for 10W/60 shock oil or Citroën LHM+ to regain adjustability without chewing seals, especially on freebie take-offs.[^damper-oil]
- **Favor suspended frames for high-power conversions:** Ninebot Max G2 chassis with suspension outlast rigid G30 decks under vibration, SNSC rental frames survive high-speed crashes with minimal damage, and DNM shock/13"×7" tire combos plus lever-free hub tire removals keep service visits efficient.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L316-L316】

## Tire & Traction Observations
- **Balance electronics with mechanics:** Traction control helps rein front-wheel slip up to ~55 mph, but riders still cut front phase amps to keep dual-drive scooters manageable in launches.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L74-L74】
- **Match tires to power levels:** Xuancheng 12" slicks stay budget-friendly but spin under hard launches, so high-power builds migrate to CST or PMT rubber; on 6" rims, Tuovt 90/55-6 casings grip better than CST 90/65-6 while oversized 6.5" skins pinch split rims and look sloppy.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L75-L78】
- **Pick tires for the surface, not hype:** Riders are steering 10" Zero/Vsett owners toward CST 10×3 or PMT 10×3.5 rubber, calling Xuancheng slicks short-lived above 4 kW without traction control, and leaning on Tuovt 90/55-6 for broken pavement longevity.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L348-L350】
- **Address pinch flats proactively:** Vsett 9 owners fighting split-rim pinch flats now double heavy-duty Ulip tubes, dust them with baby powder during install, and experiment with 3D-printed bead covers to protect the tube crease.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L79-L79】
- **Seat beads aggressively on 10″ tires:** Ratchet straps, lubricant, and >100 psi blasts are often required to pop stubborn beads; cheap molds can still leave paper-thin gaps that need repeated cycles to seal.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L265-L266】
- **Tubeless vs. tubes remains situational:** Tubeless with sealant pays off on long routes, but some riders still slip tubes into tubeless rims for roadside convenience despite the added heat load.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L266-L267】

## Security Layers & Theft Response
- Hide GPS trackers along the main harness, combine Rita builds with motion alarms inside the battery bag, and budget a hardened chain for long stops; layered defenses buy recovery time even though determined thieves can still lift a 20 kg scooter.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L896-L896】

## Documentation & Support Habits
- Keep a photo log of connector routing, ST-Link pinouts, and fuse replacements so future technicians can retrace your steps. Denis’ English manual is updated as new edge cases surface—reference it before opening support tickets.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L209-L210】
- Archive VESC Tool logs before sealing decks: Android 11+ hides files under `Android/data/vedder.vesctool/files`, so plan to pull them via TCP bridge or file managers like XFolder after each shakedown.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L3440-L4018】
- Track firmware sizes before flashing. Vedder’s 6.0 beta already stretches binaries past single Ubox MCU limits unless paired with the matching VESC Tool build, so mirror Git changelog notes and update desktop tools before pushing field upgrades.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part002.txt†L1841-L1853】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part002.txt†L2125-L2127】

## Mini-Bike & Fiido L3 Conversions
- **Respect the stock controller limits:** Fiido L3 controllers float loose without heatsinks and only deliver ~25 A; jumping straight to 20 S test packs without pre-charging popped factory BMS units. Match pack voltages before connecting higher-voltage VESC hardware.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L381-L381】
- **Dial conservative currents:** After cutting battery current to ~20 A, setting traction control to 20/20 A, and capping phase around 60 A with FW, builders hit 45 km/h and repeatable wheelies without overheating the compact hub.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L382-L382】
- **Plan full teardowns:** Packs are heavily sealed—glued busbars, soldered fasteners, and tripped protection boards left entire parallel groups at 0 V—so refurb projects require full BMS removal rather than capacitor swaps.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L383-L383】

[^damper-oil]: PuneDir’s free steering damper only behaved after switching to lighter fluids; veterans now recommend 10W/60 shock oil or Citroën LHM+ to preserve seals while restoring adjustability.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L56-L56】
