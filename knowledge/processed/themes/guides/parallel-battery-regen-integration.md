# Parallel Battery & Regen Integration Manual

## TL;DR
- Match pack voltages before paralleling and avoid ideal diodes; real-world tests on 17S/16S stacks caused throttle cut-outs and offered no regen benefits compared with direct, voltage-matched links.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L153-L156】
- Treat regen as a controller- and battery-limited budget: split braking current across packs, keep the combined limit within both packs’ safe charge rates, and raise BMS regen ceilings (e.g., 100 A on JBD units) so the controller does not dump energy into MOSFETs instead.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L154-L157】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L693-L703】
- Regen only works when the charge path is enabled; disabling the BMS charge MOSFET or relying on regen without hydraulic brakes has already produced weak braking and safety gaps on live builds.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L157-L163】
- Test pack health—parallel 13S6P Samsung 35E modules only after confirming internal resistance matches closely, even when cells share BMS models and cycle counts.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L1582-L1596】
- Use robust harnessing. Builders paralleling 52 V packs lean on XT90 Y adapters and matched Higo looms, matching voltage first and letting multiple chargers share the load because each supply naturally tapers in CV mode as the packs equalise.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L20518-L20539】
- Spintend’s rheostatic brake module can absorb ~10 A once pack regen saturates, but it is a safety valve—not a replacement for matching pack charge limits—so keep most braking inside the batteries.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L316-L316】

## Pack Pairing Pre-Flight Checklist
1. **Equalise voltage first.** Bring both packs to the same resting voltage before making the parallel connection. Builders observed natural balancing currents under ~1 A once voltages matched, versus abrupt faults when voltages differed by a full cell group.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L154-L156】
   - Tie pack negatives together and confirm both batteries share identical series counts/capacity before the final connection; mismatched packs cross-charge aggressively even with individual BMSes and can overheat the smaller module.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L124-L126】
2. **Plan capacity-aware cutoffs.** Mixed packs (e.g., small internal C-rate plus large 2 C external) still share state-of-charge; log per-pack voltage drop during endurance runs (≈13 V over 38 mi in testing) to size cutoffs and avoid deep cycling the smaller module.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L154-L155】
3. **Verify BMS readiness.** Confirm that every pack’s charge path is active and any smart-BMS current limits exceed expected regen peaks (≥100 A on 20 S JBD examples) before heading out.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L157-L157】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L703-L703】
- **Match internal resistance before paralleling.** Happy Giraffe’s dual 13S6P Samsung 35E setup only behaved after IR checks proved the packs were aligned; skip the parallel link if one pack drifts high.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L1582-L1596】
- **Load-test suspect externals.** Denis’ workshop found bargain 10 S packs sagging immediately, leaving the internal module to carry the ride—bench them alone at low amperage before trusting their specs in a parallel stack.[^cheap-externals]
- **Keep chemistries uniform.** Mixing MJ1 and MH1 cells in the same parallel bank drove uneven sag above ~8 A per cell; swap the odd pack or rebuild before closing the loop.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L7100-L7125】

## Wiring & Current-Sharing Strategy
- **Skip ideal diodes for everyday riding.** Diode-protected tests on 17 S/16 S packs triggered throttle cut-outs without meaningfully reducing balancing current. Instead, match voltages, plug in directly, and rely on pack capacity differences to dictate current share (larger packs naturally absorb more regen).【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L154-L156】
- **Use high-quality connectors and inspections.** High-current scooters running parallel harnesses have destroyed QS8 links and controllers when connections loosened; add pre-ride continuity checks whenever you modify pack wiring.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L411-L411】
- **Fuse each leg.** Install inline fuses or breakers per pack so a single short does not cascade through the entire parallel assembly—a lesson reinforced by riders dailying 20 S packs without discharge-side BMS protection.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L224-L224】

## Regen Budgeting & Controller Configuration
- **Allocate regen per pack.** Limit VESC negative battery current so the sum of all packs’ settings stays below their combined safe charge rate; riders planning 30 A, 3 s emergency stops are using these calculations to remain within chemical limits.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L154-L156】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L173-L173】
- **Match regen to amp-hours.** Artem’s quick math keeps battery regen at or below the pack’s Ah rating (e.g., ≤10 A on a 10 Ah block) and sets controller regen roughly 15 A higher so excess power becomes heat instead of spiking cells or tripping BMS charge FETs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L17390-L17416】
- **Respect controller ceilings.** Regen remains phase-current limited—pushing beyond the controller’s thermal capacity will overheat MOSFETs before healthy packs object. Keep controller telemetry on hand to verify that regen spikes stay inside hardware budgets.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L156-L156】
- **Tune VESC voltage caps.** One 75 200 failure traced to regen voltage spikes because the controller’s max input voltage exceeded the pack’s comfort zone while the JBD limit stayed at stock; raising the BMS regen ceiling and tightening VESC’s voltage limit prevented further MOSFET deaths.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L693-L703】
- **Raise BMS voltage ceilings when regen cuts out early.** Matthew’s 18 S Spintend 85/150 stopped braking above ~76.6 V until he nudged the BMS cutoff start/end upward; the controller was fine once the BMS limit matched his target regen voltage.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L611-L614】

## BMS & Charge-Path Safeguards
- **Leave charge MOSFETs enabled.** Disabling the BMS charge FET neutered regen braking until riders re-enabled it, proving that “charge off” modes directly cut regen authority.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L157-L157】
- **Audit charge-only BMS setups.** Some 20 S commuters are still riding with only a 40 A charge-side ANT board; peers called out the fire risk and urged restoring full discharge protection before another controller failure.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L224-L224】
- **Log smart-BMS telemetry.** JBD/Xiaoxiang apps expose regen current, pack voltage, and MOSFET temperatures—capture these during first shakedowns to validate that firmware changes (e.g., no-limit builds) stay inside BMS envelopes.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L693-L703】
- **Plan Daly resets.** Display-equipped Daly BMS units ignore remote-off commands, latch MOSFETs after sag, and can flip charge FETs during strong regen—budget an external antispark and keep the Bluetooth app handy for resets.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L315-L316】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L368-L368】
- **Bridge data into the VESC bus.** Plug-in CAN adapters let LLT/JBD boards stream pack voltage, current, and alarms directly to controllers and dashboards, making it easier to catch regen spikes before they cook MOSFETs.[^can-bridge]
- **Expect surge when one pack drops out.** Parallel packs generally balance each other, but if one BMS trips under heavy load the remaining pack sees a sudden current spike that can kill it—coordinate cutoff thresholds and fast fusing.[^bms-surge]

## Thermal & Mechanical Guardrails
- **Monitor pack heating under parallel pulls.** Dual MakerBase 100 A stacks pushing ~400 A battery combined already flirt with pack heat soak; adding parallel packs raises sustained power capability but only if you manage airflow and thermal mass.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L539-L540】
- **Keep hydraulic brakes in service.** Several Ninebot and Ubox conversions rode with only −90 A motor brake while waiting on parts; others survived emergency stops thanks to cable/hydraulic brakes when regen-only systems failed. Treat regen as supplemental, not primary, stopping power.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L163-L163】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L395-L395】
- **Mind rider stability.** Testers reported −80 A regen nearly pitching them over the bars, so tune Spinny profiles or throttle ramps before trusting regen-only braking on heavy scooters.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L249-L249】
- **Document heat thresholds.** Builders noted controller temps climbing before motors when leaning on regen for long descents; watch MOSFET sensors and dial back regen if controller temps spike even when motors feel cool.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L395-L395】
- **Check packs after wet rides.** A 30 S parallel group drifted out of balance after moisture seeped into the enclosure—dry and inspect housings before re-paralleling so regen doesn’t push mismatched groups further apart.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L10491-L10505】

## Implementation Checklist
1. Balance pack voltages and confirm BMS charge paths are active before making the parallel connection.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L154-L157】
2. Set per-pack regen limits inside VESC Tool so the total equals the combined safe charge current, and raise any smart-BMS charge limits accordingly.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L154-L157】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L693-L703】
3. Log the first shakedown ride—capture pack voltage delta, peak regen current, and controller temperatures—to validate assumptions before sealing the deck.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L155-L156】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L395-L395】
4. Schedule periodic mechanical brake inspections; regen-only builds have already highlighted the danger of delaying hydraulic installs or maintenance.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L163-L163】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L395-L395】
