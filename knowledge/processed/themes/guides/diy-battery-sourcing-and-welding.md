# DIY Battery Sourcing & Welding Playbook (2025)

## TL;DR
- Grade-A 50PL and P45B cells now define the performance ceiling, but prices swing from €1–1.5 in the EU to ~$9 in the US, so teams must align sourcing tactics with customs realities before scoping pack power levels.[^1][^2]
- Copper spot welding remains the gating competency: bargain 90 € welders rarely prove 0.15 mm claims, while K-Weld or Glitter rigs with proper maintenance reliably join 0.1 mm copper for 22 S packs.[^3][^10]
- Budget worksheets should factor in consumables, BMS headroom, and future tariff shocks (e.g., QS8 connectors drifting toward $35) to avoid mid-build redesigns when scaling beyond 300 A continuous.[^4][^5]

## Workshop Pricing & BMS Baselines
- Denis’ catalog still quotes ~€170 for a 10S4P Samsung 35E pack, €30 for the Wildman bag, and roughly €20 for EU shipping via DPD/UPS; he insists on genuine XT30 hardware and 20 A common-port BMS boards rather than AliExpress knock-offs.[^denis-pricing]
- External packs stay on common-port BMSes so Rita can police charge flow—Denis refuses to ship his smart separate-port boards in range kits because they can’t stop overcharge through the discharge lead.[^common-port-chat]
- Production packs come from the m365Krakow workshop; Denis handles support and logistics while the partner assembles cells, so large orders should plan around their combined lead times.[^m365krakow]

## Cell Market Benchmarks
| Source | Typical Price & Availability | Verified Performance | Procurement Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Stark Varg salvage modules (50PL)** | ≈€1 per cell after labor in Europe | Bench-tested at 60 A discharge / 15 A charge with tight variance | Requires teardown expertise and logistics for pallet shipments.[^1] |
| **NKON / EU wholesalers (50PL)** | €1.5 per cell retail; logos often milled off | Verified as grade A despite shaved markings | Maintain purchase records to satisfy customs queries about rebranded stock.[^2] |
| **US resellers (50PL)** | ~$9 per cell | Same performance as EU stock | Factor in tariffs and shipping; consider freight-forwarding via EU partners.[^2] |
| **Custom P45B/P50B packs** | €3000–€4500 for 22 S 10 P/11 P assemblies | Continuous ≈495 A, BMS peaks ≈1040 A | Group buys enable supply; document BMS limits (≤500 A continuous today).[^6][^7] |
| **Commissioned builds (UK/US)** | Varies; premium vs DIY delta covers tooling | Output tied to builder’s QC logs | Trusted builders like jamessoderstrom eliminate tooling spend for one-off packs.[^11] |

### Chemistry Trade-Off Snapshots
- **Sony VTC6A vs. Molicel P42A vs. Samsung 30T:** VTC6A delivers the lowest sag and coolest temps but runs roughly double the cost of P42A unless you buy ~10 k cells per month; 30T still hits hardest but sacrifices capacity, so reserve it for burst-focused builds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L1603-L1655】

### Market Shifts & Pricing Signals
- Nickel’s 2022 price surge (+250 %) pushed pack builders toward 0.1–0.15 mm copper strip—it bends easier over cell tops, carries more current, and costs less than the remaining nickel stockpile.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L686-L687】
- Sony VTC5D prototypes are landing alongside Samsung 35E/50G/50S, Molicel P28A/P42A, and Samsung 48X cells; Artem is sourcing fresh 40T/48X/50G stock at €4–5 per cell while group buys quote P42A around €4 and 50S near €12.95, setting the 2025 price floor for high-discharge packs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L695-L696】

## Welding Equipment Decision Guide
| Scenario | Recommended Tooling | Why It Wins | Follow-Up Checks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| First copper pack, limited budget | Rent/borrow K-Weld or Glitter kit | Proven to fuse 0.1 mm copper reliably versus unproven 90 € units | Inspect weld nuggets under magnification; rip-test samples before scaling.[^3] |
| Daily fabrication shop | Own Glitter 811A or K-Weld with high-current PSU | Handles repeated 4 kA+ hits when contacts are clean | Schedule bus pin cleaning to prevent E01 faults and maintain 4.4 kA output.[^10] |
| Mixed chemistries (pouch + cylindrical) | Use adjustable pulse welders with copper/nickel sandwiches | Controls heat on dissimilar tabs, minimizes swelling risk | Pair with upgraded ≥230 A BMS and temperature probes on parallel groups.[^6] |
| Tight copper layouts | Stack 0.1 mm copper under nickel and cap each strike near 50–60 J | Dual-strip “infinite slot” technique pushes current into the can without cracking copper | Validate that 10 mm-wide copper already supports ~15–20 A per cell (≈200 A on 9 P) before oversizing plates.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L25425-L25518】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L25469-L25490】 |

- Malectrics V4 welders now ship with parallel MOSFET daughterboards and run happily from triple 3 S LiPos; some builders still drop to 2 S packs to tame FET heating because the welder regulates to ~5–6 V at the electrodes.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L604-L605】
- Artem’s 0.1 mm copper-under-nickel stacks respond best to heavy compression and careful hot-glue alignment—done right they only sag ~3.5 V at 60 A on 60 V Samsung 35E packs versus the 7–20 V drop seen on looser busbars.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L607-L608】

### Booster & Launch Packs
- **High-C LiPo reservoirs.** CNHL and GNB 140 C–180 C packs keep kWeld/Glitter rigs and launch boosters punching above 2 kA, but they empty within a sprint—parallel two or more bricks if you need repeat hits instead of single holeshots.[^cnhl-booster]

## Pack Architecture Case Studies
| Platform | Layout & Cells | Controller Pairing | Lessons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dual 70H race scooter | 22 S10/11 P P45B modules | MakerX G300 duals | Logs justify nearly 500 A continuous; plan dual-BMS or fuse strategy until 700 A-class boards exist.[^4][^7] |
| Dualtron Achilleus | 20 S8 P Molicel / 22 S9 P custom | Spintend 85250 relocated outside deck | Deck measures ≈48.5 cm × 18.1 cm—external controller mounting frees volume for ≥100 A batteries.[^4][^8] |
| VSETT 10+ 20 S9 P | Copper-clad “W” pack with pre-welded tabs, QS8 connectors, copper bus reinforcements (~$170 shipped) | Controllers relocated outside deck | 168 mm-wide pack slides into the 171 mm cavity once controllers move; 19 mm PVC + 5 mm acrylic risers raise the lid for a top-mounted BMS.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L8851-L8913】 |
| Blade-compatible prototype | 20 S8 P Sony/Murata VTC5D (35 A cells) | In validation; targeting Blade hub swaps | Builder is logging 30 A sag data, comparing against Samsung 35E/50G/P42A alternatives, and pricing VTC5D vs. group-buy chemistries before committing to production.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L689-L696】 |
| Nami commuter upgrade | 22 S10 P layout in development | Awaiting high-current controllers | CNC + 3D-printed supports required; treat as modular sled to service 50PL packs.[^12] |
| G3 30 S conversion | 30 S3 P modules (15 S6 P split) | High-voltage VESC | Requires grinding factory brackets; 30 S4 P too wide without chassis surgery and new BMS routing.[^13] |
| 20 S10 P Samsung 40T | Dual Ubox 85250 | 0.2 mm copper busbars deliver ~350 A continuous / 450 A burst; avoid mixing pouch cells in parallel due to swelling | Reserve space for ≥230 A BMS and monitor temps during 40 kW pulls.[^6] |

## Cost Planning Worksheet
1. **Cell procurement** – price the primary chemistry plus 10 % spares for grading losses and future replacements.[^2][^11]
2. **Interconnects & welding** – include copper/nickel, insulation, weld probe maintenance, and PPE alongside the welder cost or rental fees.[^3][^10]
3. **BMS & protection** – today’s compact boards cap around 500 A continuous; large packs may need dual-BMS or fuse-plus-charge solutions until 700 A hardware lands.[^7]
4. **Connectors & harnessing** – QS8 connectors, 8–10 AWG silicone wire, and panel mounts are trending upward in price due to tariffs—stockpile early.[^5][^9]
5. **Enclosure & structural supports** – CNC plates, 3D spacers, and adhesives trump hot glue for 22 S builds; treat mechanical retention as part of the electrical budget.[^8][^14]
6. **Labor or outsourcing** – weigh the tooling investment against commissioning vetted builders when customs, shipping, or learning curves threaten schedules.[^11]

### Supplier Dispute Playbook
- **Document substitutions before filing claims.** Accepting a downgraded charger (e.g., 350 W XT90 delivered instead of a 500 W/100 V unit) still leaves room for partial refunds—log the shortfall with photos and voltage checks before escalating with the seller.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L94-L95】
- **Vet “premium” rebuilders.** Nordbot packs have arrived with rewrapped cells, exposed busbars, and flimsy insulation—treat the vendor as suspect and demand teardown photos before wiring them into high-power scooters.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L9376-L9399】

## QA & Maintenance Protocols
- **Thermal interface audits:** Log controller and stator temperatures on first shakedown runs; resurface heatsink plates and refresh thermal paste before chasing 400 A+ per motor.[^9]
- **Weld verification:** Rip-test sample strips each session, especially after cleaning Glitter bus pins, to confirm energy settings haven’t drifted.[^10]
- **Harness strain relief:** Use deck plates or external mounts to keep relocated controllers from stressing phase leads and QS8 connectors during pack swaps.[^8][^9]
- **Wrap and isolate cells:** Heat-shrink each 21700, add Kapton plus wax/fish-paper between parallels, sheath the finished pack in epoxy board and giant heat-shrink, and add a cradle strap so it slides in/out without scuffing the deck.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L8927-L8933】
- **Balance lead soldering:** Flow ~0.5 s of 400 °C heat with solder paste so the copper strip soaks the thermal load—short pulses keep cells cool while locking balance wires into the copper bus.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L8874-L8897】
- **Telemetry cross-checks:** Pair CAN smart BMS data with VESC logs to validate current draw and spot calibration drift in shunt-based readings.[^7]
- **Stay in the longevity window:** Artem keeps commuter packs between roughly 20 % and 85 % (≈3.6–4.1 V/cell) and under 40–45 °C; sag beyond ~3 V or repeated 70 °C peaks can cut lifespan to ~400 cycles.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L698-L699】
- **Finish work around positives:** Deburr nickel edges near cell tops and re-seat fishpaper before closing the pack—sharp tabs have already pierced insulation on low-current power-bank builds.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L122364-L122385】
- **Print holders for heat, not looks.** PLA cradles slump once cells warm; switch to PETG or ASA around 230 °C/100 °C bed temps so 21700 honeycombs and Wildman bag sleds stay rigid in summer decks.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L116230-L116236】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L89665-L89696】
- **Document capacity checks.** Time OEM chargers (≈1.7 Ah per hour on Xiaomi bricks) when vetting customer packs; a genuine 12 Ah module needs nearly seven hours from empty.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L98595-L98598】
- **Log cell provenance.** Refurb lots from NKON (late-2021 Samsung 35E/50E) arrive graded and safe when treated like fresh stock; track batch codes and keep compression on pouch experiments so swelling doesn’t lift tabs.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L97241-L97259】

### Mounting & Housing Patterns
- **Armor deck-mounted conduits.** Twin 10S packs strapped along the deck need metal shielding and permanent wiring—open conduit runs are “self-propelled bombs” unless the housing resists impacts and stays wired for continuous duty.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L230-L234】
- **Overbuild bag brackets.** Wildman bag packs now use eight screw/wide-washer mounts, fiberglass sleeving, and interior foam so cells can’t chafe on hardware or eject during pothole hits.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L361-L362】
- **Expect tight tolerances.** A 13S5P/16S3P 21700 stack just fits a 3 L Wildman when you skip holders, while 13S4P assemblies barely squeeze into 2–3 L shells—plan for custom spacers, cardboard liners, and printed cages before drilling the pack.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L362-L363】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L165-L165】
- **Retire fatigued brackets.** Heavy 13S packs crack 3D-printed rear supports near the rear bolt; inspect and replace printed mounts routinely or swap to metal before pushing high-speed builds.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L352-L352】

### Salvage & Pack Handling Lessons
- **Plan for encapsulated fleet packs.** Ninebot rental batteries bury their BMS inside silicone potting; expect to chisel sealant or swap a fresh board because resets are impossible while encapsulated.[^15]
- **Avoid grinders on aluminum shells.** Score the silicone bead with a utility knife, brace the enclosure in a vise, and drive the cell brick out with a wooden drift from the non-BMS end to preserve wiring.[^16]
- **Treat 0.1 mm nickel stacks like structural parts.** Double layers safely carry ≈20 A BMS currents, but only when bonded with multiple high-energy weld strikes—thin hot glue fails once packs warm.[^17]
- **Invest in training before welding.** Veterans keep Micah Toll’s handbook on the bench so new builders understand failure modes before touching live cells.[^18]
- **Model builds around stock chemistries.** Xiaomi packs routinely ship with LG M26 or blue EVE 18650 cells; use those discharge curves when calculating performance instead of optimistic MJ1 assumptions.[^19]
- **Distribute shoulder-bag loads.** Add thin aluminum plates outside fiberglass fire sleeves to spread weight and shield packs from direct flame when slinging externals over a shoulder.[^20]

## Action Checklist
1. **Lock sourcing** – secure cell batches (with customs paperwork) before welding to avoid chemistry mismatches mid-build.[^1][^2]
2. **Stage tooling** – confirm welder calibration with sacrificial strips and schedule maintenance (cleaning, electrode dressing) ahead of production days.[^3][^10]
3. **Model pack fitment** – dry-fit modules in CAD or cardboard using deck measurements (e.g., 48.5 cm × 18.1 cm for Dualtron Achilleus) to plan controller relocation.[^8]
4. **Budget protection gear** – purchase BMS units, fuses, QS8 connectors, and spare harness parts before tariffs or stockouts force redesigns.[^5][^7][^9]
5. **Document performance** – archive discharge/charge test data, weld logs, and thermal profiles so future revisions start from validated baselines.[^1][^6][^10]
