# DIY Battery Sourcing & Welding Playbook (2025)

## TL;DR
- Grade-A 50PL and P45B cells now define the performance ceiling, but prices swing from €1–1.5 in the EU to ~$9 in the US, so teams must align sourcing tactics with customs realities before scoping pack power levels.[^1][^2]
- Copper spot welding remains the gating competency: bargain 90 € welders rarely prove 0.15 mm claims, while K-Weld or Glitter rigs with proper maintenance reliably join 0.1 mm copper for 22 S packs.[^3][^10]
- Mirono steers newcomers toward Docreate’s ~€100 capacitor welder and copper-under-nickel sandwiches (≈40 J for nickel, 60–70 J for copper) because LSUC-branded caps underdeliver and bare copper strips fail pull tests without a nickel cap.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L301-L303】
- Budget worksheets should factor in consumables, BMS headroom, and future tariff shocks (e.g., QS8 connectors drifting toward $35) to avoid mid-build redesigns when scaling beyond 300 A continuous.[^4][^5]

## Workshop Pricing & BMS Baselines
- Denis’ catalog still quotes ~€170 for a 10S4P Samsung 35E pack, €30 for the Wildman bag, and roughly €20 for EU shipping via DPD/UPS; he insists on genuine XT30 hardware and 20 A common-port BMS boards rather than AliExpress knock-offs.[^denis-pricing]
- The workshop flags “fire emoji” AliExpress packs built from laptop pulls—builders cap Happy BMS builds near 53 V/40 A and lean on refurbished OEM modules plus externals for range instead of forcing Rita past spec.[^ali-pack-warning-diy]
- Aerdu’s inexpensive 10S packs can deliver honest capacity when properly potted, but missing fish paper between series groups remains a fire risk—veterans still favour reputable cell sellers (e.g., NKON) and add insulation themselves before shipping customs builds.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L521-L522】
- External packs stay on common-port BMSes so Rita can police charge flow—Denis refuses to ship his smart separate-port boards in range kits because they can’t stop overcharge through the discharge lead.[^common-port-chat]
- Production packs come from the m365Krakow workshop; Denis handles support and logistics while the partner assembles cells, so large orders should plan around their combined lead times.[^m365krakow]
- LLT’s 100 A smart boards remain the viable option for 4 S boosters—cheaper BMSes brown out, and pushing Flipsky 75100 boxes to 20 S simply moves failure to the wiring long before the ESC runs out of headroom.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L216-L216】
- JK active-balancing boards keep outrunning Daly units on telemetry and balancing strength; builders now reserve Daly for budget builds and spec JK or LLT when 20 S packs need reliable comms and cell maintenance.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L369-L369】
- Daly’s 100Balance smart board can still support serious builds—Jerome’s 20 S 9 P EVE 40P pack pairs it with 0.2 mm copper busbars and keeps GT2 motors around 7–10 kW continuous before heat becomes the limit.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L221-L227】
- ANT smart BMS packs ship with a “starting current” precharge MOSFET; run it around 5 A for spark-free bring-up and keep it below 20 A or the firmware times out if bus caps never charge.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L383-L383】
- **Match gauge charts carefully.** Builders keep confusing conductor diameter with cross-sectional area—Smart Repair reminds shops that dual 14 AWG runs roughly equal an 11 AWG cross-section, so convert using area tables before sizing harness upgrades.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L352-L356】
- **Pick the right welding process.** Halo deck and Nami frame repairs favour TIG work or professional shops; budget MIG rigs spatter excessively and stick welders simply cannot penetrate scooter aluminium without compromising strength.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L217-L224】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L225-L231】
- **Size soldering irons for busbar work.** High-current harnesses solder cleanly with 200–300 W handheld irons or 350 W “3 kg” stations proven on QS8 connectors—tiny 65 W wands only cope if you overdrive them, which risks cold joints and melted insulation.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L231-L238】

## Cell Market Benchmarks
| Source | Typical Price & Availability | Verified Performance | Procurement Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Stark Varg salvage modules (50PL)** | ≈€1 per cell after labor in Europe | Bench-tested at 60 A discharge / 15 A charge with tight variance | Requires teardown expertise and logistics for pallet shipments.[^1] |
| **NKON / EU wholesalers (50PL)** | €1.5 per cell retail; logos often milled off | Verified as grade A despite shaved markings | Maintain purchase records to satisfy customs queries about rebranded stock.[^2] |
| **US resellers (50PL)** | ~$9 per cell | Same performance as EU stock | Factor in tariffs and shipping; consider freight-forwarding via EU partners.[^2] |
| **Custom P45B/P50B packs** | €3000–€4500 for 22 S 10 P/11 P assemblies | Continuous ≈495 A, BMS peaks ≈1040 A | Group buys enable supply; document BMS limits (≤500 A continuous today).[^6][^7] |
| **Samsung 6A & Lishen LR21700 12A** | Community-grade pulls, availability fluctuates | Regarded as “plenty” for Blade motors; LR2170LA variants have survived repeated >3 C draws in field use | Line up supply before retiring MH1/MG1 spares, budget for thicker harness routing, and expect to replace saggy LG M26 20 S 20 P concepts with higher-discharge 21700s to keep QS-class motors fed.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L271-L277】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L477-L477】 |
| **EVE 40PL factory-direct** | ≈$4.35 per cell (≥50 unit MOQ) plus freight/taxes | High-power cells shipping direct from the factory | Savings disappear without true bulk orders—budget duties and shipping before chasing the discount.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L478-L478】 |
| **Commissioned builds (UK/US)** | Varies; premium vs DIY delta covers tooling | Output tied to builder’s QC logs | Trusted builders like jamessoderstrom eliminate tooling spend for one-off packs.[^11] |
| **BAK 2.5 Ah 20 A cells** | Budget-friendly yet capacity-limited options for dual 20 S packs (~17.5 Ah per half) | Continuous output around 40 A per pack; expect steep voltage sag at 100 A draws | Plan parallel 8 AWG-equivalent leads and set range expectations realistically.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L236-L236】 |

### Chemistry Trade-Off Snapshots
- **Sony VTC6A vs. Molicel P42A vs. Samsung 30T:** VTC6A delivers the lowest sag and coolest temps but runs roughly double the cost of P42A unless you buy ~10 k cells per month; 30T still hits hardest but sacrifices capacity, so reserve it for burst-focused builds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L1603-L1655】

### Market Shifts & Pricing Signals
- Nickel’s 2022 price surge (+250 %) pushed pack builders toward 0.1–0.15 mm copper strip—it bends easier over cell tops, carries more current, and costs less than the remaining nickel stockpile.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L686-L687】
- Sony VTC5D prototypes are landing alongside Samsung 35E/50G/50S, Molicel P28A/P42A, and Samsung 48X cells; Artem is sourcing fresh 40T/48X/50G stock at €4–5 per cell while group buys quote P42A around €4 and 50S near €12.95, setting the 2025 price floor for high-discharge packs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L695-L696】
- **Samsung 50S group buys:** Community orders are landing grade-A 50S cells at €4.71 each with the potential for ~15 % savings when payments avoid eBay/PayPal fees—coordinate escrow and inspection to lock in the deal before public pricing rebounds above €6.50.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L148-L150】
- **Price/performance quick look:** Expect Samsung 30T around €2.50, 35E near €3.40, and 50G/50S roughly €4–4.5 when bought in quantity, with discharge logs confirming P42A outpaces 40T at 20–30 A, 50G shines at 7–15 A, and 50S matches P42A only if you can justify the premium.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L606-L607】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L694-L695】
- **21700 energy density vs. recycled 18650s:** Recycled EVE 26V 18650 cells struggle beyond ~5 A per cell, whereas fresh Samsung 35E/48X/50S 21700 options pack more watt-hours into Xiaomi/Ninebot decks and sustain 15–20 A draws—reserve reclaimed cells for low-power builds and spec new 21700s for high-range projects.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L118-L118】
- **Honeycomb nickel shortages:** EU builders now pool orders for half-kilo lots because suppliers refuse to ship sub-1 kg batches; expect ~40 € quotes locally or wait on AliExpress consolidation when stocking cell cages.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L17309-L17312】

Regional sourcing realities still shape chemistry choices: Turkish builders blocked from NKON settle for Samsung 29E/50E lots despite higher sag, while racers keep paying for Molicel P45B as the only 21700 that resists brutal voltage droop at high current.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L513-L513】 South Korean riders face customs and licensing barriers on Samsung 40T/50S imports, so they lean on reclaimed MH1 packs or coordinate cross-border friend shipments unless they can travel with empty hardware.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L47-L47】 AliExpress flash sales still advertise fantasy pricing—message sellers for real quotes, expect shipping to erase the $6-per-cell clickbait, and stick with the one vetted vendor the community trusts when you cannot buy direct.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L579-L579】

### 8–9 P Chemistry Trade-offs
- **P45B for brute force.** Choose Molicel P45B when the build needs 400 A+ bursts and minimal voltage sag; the premium pricing beats rebuilding packs that rely on mid-grade cells and cook under race duty.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L605-L605】
- **Reclaimed Stark modules need careful prep.** Builders are restacking Stark’s mis-welded P45B stock into 20 S 5 P bricks without adhesives, logging 85 km/h before field weakening and planning higher current once the rebuilt pack is validated.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L424-L425】
- **P42A as the value pick.** P42A arrays still deliver stout 300–350 A performance for commuters and canyon riders, especially when paired with faster charging rather than upsizing parallel count.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L605-L605】
- **Samsung 50S for range.** 50S and LG 50LT cells stretch 8–9 P packs for touring but expect more sag—pair them with conservative current limits or dual-pack fast-charging plans instead of chasing peak amps.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L605-L605】
- **Budget chemistries need charge discipline.** Builders chasing LG M58 or Samsung 50E endurance budgets lean on higher-current chargers instead of premium cells; model turnaround times so clients understand the compromise.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L605-L605】

> **Aspilsan A28 watchlist:** Telegram anecdotes praise ~16 mΩ internal resistance and cool 15 A continuous runs, but we still need controlled lab testing (capacity, sag, cycle life) before recommending the chemistry broadly.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L529-L529】

- Denis’ crew still treats LG M29 or EVE 33V cells as the baseline for 15 S AWD commuters, with Molicel P42A/40T, Samsung 25R/30Q, and Sony VTC5/VTC6 reserved for higher-discharge layouts—21700 formats remain the preferred starting point for dual-motor projects.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L76-L77】

## Welding Equipment Decision Guide
High-current harness work still rewards oversized irons—shops rely on 200–300 W handheld irons or 3 kg stations for QS8 leads, while 65 W tools only keep up when dangerously overdriven.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L369-L374】
| Scenario | Recommended Tooling | Why It Wins | Follow-Up Checks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| First copper pack, limited budget | Rent/borrow K-Weld or Glitter kit | Proven to fuse 0.1 mm copper reliably versus unproven 90 € units | Inspect weld nuggets under magnification; rip-test samples before scaling.[^3] |
| Daily fabrication shop | Own Glitter 811A or K-Weld with high-current PSU | Handles repeated 4 kA+ hits when contacts are clean | Schedule bus pin cleaning to prevent E01 faults and maintain 4.4 kA output.[^10] |
| Mixed chemistries (pouch + cylindrical) | Use adjustable pulse welders with copper/nickel sandwiches | Controls heat on dissimilar tabs, minimizes swelling risk | Pair with upgraded ≥230 A BMS and temperature probes on parallel groups.[^6] |
| Tight copper layouts | Stack 0.1 mm copper under nickel and cap each strike near 50–60 J | Dual-strip “infinite slot” technique pushes current into the can without cracking copper | Validate that 10 mm-wide copper already supports ~15–20 A per cell (≈200 A on 9 P) before oversizing plates.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L25425-L25518】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L25469-L25490】 |

- Malectrics V4 welders now ship with parallel MOSFET daughterboards and run happily from triple 3 S LiPos; some builders still drop to 2 S packs to tame FET heating because the welder regulates to ~5–6 V at the electrodes.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L604-L605】
- Artem’s 0.1 mm copper-under-nickel stacks respond best to heavy compression and careful hot-glue alignment—done right they only sag ~3.5 V at 60 A on 60 V Samsung 35E packs versus the 7–20 V drop seen on looser busbars.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L607-L608】

### Booster & Launch Packs
- **High-C LiPo reservoirs.** CNHL and GNB 140 C–180 C packs keep kWeld/Glitter rigs and launch boosters punching above 2 kA, but they empty within a sprint—parallel two or more bricks if you need repeat hits instead of single holeshots.[^cnhl-booster]

- **Shield brazed copper joints.** When builders skip spot welding and braze copper busbars, they flood the joint with argon while feeding tin so oxidation doesn’t spike resistance; humidity alone can corrode unsealed copper/nickel “sandwich” welds within a few years.[^argon-braze]

Glitter 811A/811H rigs promise 6 kA bursts with 35 mm² cables for 0.2 mm copper sandwiches, but early adopters still tear them down to resolder loose capacitors and confirm the shop has 110 V/220 V service before committing.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L352-L354】

### Copper Busbars & Sandwich Welding Notes
- Laser-cut 0.5 mm copper combs (e.g., from Peng Chen) spot-weld cleanly when clamped under nickel-plated steel overlays, delivering neat 20 S 10 P layouts without bulky braided jumpers.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L145-L147】
- Plan on ≥1 kA pulse capacity—KWeld or 1,600 A Malectrics rigs—to bond 0.2 mm copper reliably; hobby welders under the 1 kA mark struggle and drive builders back to nickel overlays.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L147-L151】
- Practice on dead cells before committing copper-nickel sandwiches to live packs; slotted nickel forces current through the can and punishes misaligned welds.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L488-L490】

- **Material cost note:** Wellgo nickel-copper laminates run about $150 shipped for a 20 S 10 P pack and solder cleanly to nickel after welding—budget the upgrade when planning copper-clad busbars.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L445-L445】

- Budget builders are experimenting with €25 purple PCB welders powered by 72 Ah car batteries—they handle 0.2 mm nickel but lack the transistor count for 0.15 mm copper, so reserve thick copper stacks for Glitter/KWeld-class rigs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L364-L365】

### Consumable Sourcing Alerts
- Leaded solder is getting scarce inside the EU; builders are already scrambling for compliant suppliers before pack repairs stall under regional restrictions.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part011.txt†L19293-L19294】
- Jerome (St0fzuiger) pointed the crew to EleShop’s 60/40 premium solder, which ships across Europe and carries enough flux to wet thick busbars—GABE is restocking there for his MP2 repairs until a broader supply chain emerges.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part011.txt†L19382-L19393】
- Peer-to-peer trades now fill the gap—PaoloWu is literally mailing GABE leaded solder so his pack repairs resume, highlighting how community swaps keep benches running when stores dry up.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L801-L805】
- GABE’s spot welder just lost a MOSFET (E02 fault); Haku’s replacement board only charges to 5.4 V and he pointed to the heavier Glitter 811H as the backup plan if repairs stall, so shops should budget downtime or a spare welder for 22 S builds.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L783-L787】

## Pack Architecture Case Studies
| Platform | Layout & Cells | Controller Pairing | Lessons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dual 70H race scooter | 22 S10/11 P P45B modules | MakerX G300 duals | Logs justify nearly 500 A continuous; plan dual-BMS or fuse strategy until 700 A-class boards exist.[^4][^7] |
| Dualtron Achilleus | 20 S8 P Molicel / 22 S9 P custom | Spintend 85250 relocated outside deck | Deck measures ≈48.5 cm × 18.1 cm—external controller mounting frees volume for ≥100 A batteries.[^4][^8] |
| VSETT 10+ 20 S9 P | Copper-clad “W” pack with pre-welded tabs, QS8 connectors, copper bus reinforcements (~$170 shipped) | Controllers relocated outside deck | 168 mm-wide pack slides into the 171 mm cavity once controllers move; 19 mm PVC + 5 mm acrylic risers raise the lid for a top-mounted BMS.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L8851-L8913】 |
| Blade-compatible prototype | 20 S8 P Sony/Murata VTC5D (35 A cells) | In validation; targeting Blade hub swaps | Builder is logging 30 A sag data, comparing against Samsung 35E/50G/P42A alternatives, and pricing VTC5D vs. group-buy chemistries before committing to production.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L689-L696】 |
| Nami commuter upgrade | 22 S10 P layout in development | Awaiting high-current controllers | CNC + 3D-printed supports required; treat as modular sled to service 50PL packs.[^12] |
| G3 30 S conversion | 30 S3 P modules (15 S6 P split) | High-voltage VESC | Requires grinding factory brackets; 30 S4 P too wide without chassis surgery and new BMS routing.[^13] |
| 20 S10 P Samsung 40T | Dual Ubox 85250 | 0.2 mm copper busbars deliver ~350 A continuous / 450 A burst; avoid mixing pouch cells in parallel due to swelling | Reserve space for ≥230 A BMS and monitor temps during 40 kW pulls.[^6] |
| MH1 commuter rebuild | 20 S4 P aging pack → planned 20 S6 P 21700 swap | Makerbase 75100 single | Stock MH1 cells sagged from 80 % to 35 % under load; rebuilders are upsizing parallel count and logging rest voltage before landing the replacement BMS.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L420-L422】 |

### 2024 Telegram Updates (input_part009)

#### Cell & Materials Decisions
| Finding | Implementation Guidance | Implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 30 S ANT boards misreport when wired to 22 S harnesses without pin swaps.[^ip009-ant-down] | Document the harness repin and configure the app for the shorter stack before trimming leads. | Preserves telemetry accuracy when down-populating high-series boards. |
| Mixed-color LG M26 stock is safe once parallel groups are binned to matching IR values.[^ip009-m26] | Grade and bin cells before welding rather than chasing cosmetic uniformity. | Focus QC time on electrical variance, not sleeve colour. |
| P42A packs bring minimal benefit on scooters capped near 120 A battery when 50H motors saturate around 60 A.[^ip009-p42a] | Choose lower-cost cells if the drivetrain cannot exploit higher current headroom. | Budget savings can fund thermal instrumentation or spare packs. |
| ASA‑CF holders demand heated chambers but deliver exceptionally rigid frames at ~€50 per 750 g of filament.[^ip009-asacf] | Reserve these prints for high-stress packs and price builds accordingly. | Factor double-the-standard-ASA material cost into client quotes. |
| XT90S anti-spark connectors fatigue quickly under scooter loads; QS8 is the preferred drop-in upgrade.[^ip009-xt90] | Upsize to QS8 (or similar) on any build expecting repeated high-current plugs. | Reduces arcing failures and warranty returns on performance scooters. |
| EVE 40PL cells hold roughly 45–70 A continuous with ~60 % capacity left after 300 cycles at 30 A.[^ip009-40pl] | Treat manufacturer 100 A claims as marketing and size packs for realistic current and lifespan. | Helps frame warranty terms around accelerated ageing on torque builds. |

#### Protection & BMS Practice
| Finding | Implementation Guidance | Implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Parallel range-extender packs only stay safe if each BMS shares voltage; a tripped BMS dumps full load onto the remaining packs.[^ip009-parallel] | Align pack voltages and current limits, and add coordinated cutoff logic or fusing. | Prevents cascading overload when one BMS trips mid-ride. |
| VESC regen respected 71.4 V on 17 S builds, so 72 V setpoints remained within controller limits.[^ip009-regen] | You can leave regen enabled near full charge on 17 S scooters without overstressing the controller, provided wiring supports it. | Simplifies regen tuning for riders who top off frequently. |
| Deep-discharging a JK-managed pack to 57 V killed cells and the BMS interface.[^ip009-deepdis] | Enforce conservative low-voltage alarms on extender packs and recharge well before hard cutoff. | Avoids irreversible cell damage and lost telemetry. |
| Active balancing boards restored pack parity in roughly an hour versus days on stock JBD balancing.[^ip009-active] | Deploy active balancers during commissioning or service to accelerate equalisation. | Shortens delivery timelines for large-capacity builds. |
| Cloud-connected smart BMS portals can be tampered with, and some apps break if you change default passwords.[^ip009-bms-app] | Keep smart BMS units offline or maintain default credentials with physical security layers. | Reduces remote sabotage risk while preserving diagnostics. |
| JK’s mobile app can disable the discharge MOSFET for storage or anti-theft once the pack is full.[^ip009-jk-mosfet] | Add the MOSFET-disable workflow to delivery checklists so riders can lock packs without rewiring. | Provides a simple parking lock without extra hardware. |
| Compact 10 S builds pulling 30–45 A per cell still favour JK/JBD 100 A boards (with ANT as backup) for protection and telemetry.[^ip009-compact-bms] | Budget space for smart BMS hardware even in tight enclosures to retain diagnostics. | Confirms that reliable protection trumps marginal space savings. |

#### Assembly & Mechanics
| Finding | Implementation Guidance | Implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Thin epoxy sheets between balance leads and copper busbars maintain insulation where plastic holders will not fit.[^ip009-epoxy] | Stock epoxy board alongside fishpaper for slim packs, especially Zero 10X builds. | Improves durability without increasing pack thickness. |
| Silicone spacers backed with fishpaper/Kapton keep honeycomb rows insulated when hot-gluing rebuilt packs.[^ip009-silicone] | Stage silicone/Kapton strips during rebuilds instead of relying on shrink alone. | Reduces rewrap labour after service. |
| Twin steel strip overlays support ~8 A per cell in LG M26 packs when reinforced, keeping 17 P builds near 10–11 kW.[^ip009-steel] | Pair steel overlays with structural bracing for high-parallel-count packs. | Offers a path to higher power without full copper busbars. |
| 0.1 mm copper sheet is the minimum for busbars; thinner 0.01 mm craft foil tears under welding current.[^ip009-copperthick] | Audit material deliveries before welding and reject ultra-thin foil. | Prevents catastrophic busbar failure mid-build. |
| Chamfer copper/nickel edges near positive terminals to stop them slicing insulation under heavy compression.[^ip009-chamfer] | Add deburring passes before final shrink and compression. | Cuts down on latent shorts in high-mass packs. |
| Tight-tolerance 3D-printed holders (PETG/ASA/ABS) outperform hot glue for spacing and heat paths, especially on long packs.[^ip009-holders] | Prioritise high-temp filaments for holders exposed to parked-car heat. | Raises mechanical reliability for summer storage. |
| Double-layer “makaron” shrink can substitute for fishpaper between rows, but scuffs faster and still benefits from fishpaper on series barriers.[^ip009-makaron] | Use makaron only for supplemental abrasion resistance, not as the sole barrier. | Avoids premature insulation wear. |
| Fiberboard between copper folds keeps 0.20–0.25 mm busbars separated until spacers land.[^ip009-fiberboard] | Slide thin fiberboard into the fold before clamping and remove it once epoxy spacers are seated. | Prevents shorting while the copper stack is aligned. |
| Barley paper at strip ends stops heavy copper sandwiches from chafing insulation when packs flex.[^ip009-barley] | Wrap each series strip in barley paper before final compression or shrink. | Boosts abrasion resistance on high-mass builds. |
| Pre-tension springy copper before welding to tame rebound.[^ip009-pretension] | Drag the strip gently over a table edge so it lies flat once the first welds land. | Makes folding safer and keeps busbars seated. |
| Reinforce hanging extender bags with rigid bases or tailored straps.[^ip009-bag] | Add structural panels or relocate the pack to stop sag that stresses frames mid-ride. | Keeps twin-pack builds stable and protects enclosures. |
| G30 conversions fitting 20 S 6 P 21700 stacks needed a 36 mm deck extender plus ~1 mm grinding around the rail opening.[^ip009-g30] | Budget machining time and extender hardware when packaging large packs with dual controllers. | Prevents rework when packs will not seat flush. |
| Twin-MP2 G30 builds stack the 20 S brick to ~14.5 cm, park the smart BMS vertically at the nose, and split current across parallel QS8 leads with multiple 8 AWG runs while a welded rear controller box preserves the deck arches.[^ip009-g30blueprint] | Mock up the vertical BMS bay and welded enclosure before final welding to confirm harness slack and controller cooling. | Keeps tall packs serviceable without weakening the frame. |
| Modular 20 S 3 P P42A travel pack | Bag accepts 6 S + 2 S subpacks; keep harnessing modular so the pack can bounce between an ebike and Ninebot while the welder is down, and add a 10 mm deck spacer as a temporary heatsink until replacement CAD files are recovered.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L17-L20】 | Maintain swappable harnesses and interim cooling so projects continue even when tooling fails. | Keeps shared packs serviceable across multiple scooters during repair downtime. |

## Cost Planning Worksheet
1. **Cell procurement** – price the primary chemistry plus 10 % spares for grading losses and future replacements.[^2][^11]
2. **Interconnects & welding** – include copper/nickel, insulation, weld probe maintenance, and PPE alongside the welder cost or rental fees.[^3][^10]
3. **BMS & protection** – today’s compact boards cap around 500 A continuous; large packs may need dual-BMS or fuse-plus-charge solutions until 700 A hardware lands.[^7]
4. **Connectors & harnessing** – QS8 connectors, 8–10 AWG silicone wire, and panel mounts are trending upward in price due to tariffs—stockpile early.[^5][^9]
5. **Copper inventory** – Nickel-copper laminate pricing swung from ~€15 to €45 per roll within weeks and is climbing again alongside copper-strip inflation debates; secure stock ahead of builds or budget fallbacks that rely on pure nickel when costs spike.[^23】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L16198-L16266】
6. **Enclosure & structural supports** – CNC plates, 3D spacers, and adhesives trump hot glue for 22 S builds; treat mechanical retention as part of the electrical budget.[^8][^14]
7. **Labor or outsourcing** – weigh the tooling investment against commissioning vetted builders when customs, shipping, or learning curves threaten schedules.[^11]

### Supplier Dispute Playbook
- **Document substitutions before filing claims.** Accepting a downgraded charger (e.g., 350 W XT90 delivered instead of a 500 W/100 V unit) still leaves room for partial refunds—log the shortfall with photos and voltage checks before escalating with the seller.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L94-L95】
- **Vet “premium” rebuilders.** Nordbot packs have arrived with rewrapped cells, exposed busbars, and flimsy insulation—treat the vendor as suspect and demand teardown photos before wiring them into high-power scooters.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L9376-L9399】

## QA & Maintenance Protocols
- **Thermal interface audits:** Log controller and stator temperatures on first shakedown runs; resurface heatsink plates and refresh thermal paste before chasing 400 A+ per motor.[^9]
- **Match weld energy to chemistry.** Nickel that grips LG MH1 cells can pop off Molicel P42A cans—step up energy or use copper-clad busbars so high-drain cells stay bonded.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L443-L443】
- **Weld verification:** Rip-test sample strips each session, especially after cleaning Glitter bus pins, to confirm energy settings haven’t drifted.[^10]
- **Copper strip finishing:** Keep scissors pivoted near their hinge for leverage on 0.15 mm sheet, cut curves gradually, and flatten tabs with a rubber or soft-blow mallet before stacking so laminates sit flat without specialty shears; builders also radius every corner and pre-tin copper inserts before welding so sharp edges and dry joints can’t chew through insulation once the pack is strapped together.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L1343-L1352】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L1492-L1493】
- **Respect kWeld lead lengths:** A 1.2 kA overcurrent alarm traced back to using the wrong cable length—swapping to the recommended leads cleared the fault—so keep probe wiring within spec before blaming the control board.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L1489-L1495】
- **Harness strain relief:** Use deck plates or external mounts to keep relocated controllers from stressing phase leads and QS8 connectors during pack swaps.[^8][^9]
- **Prep salvage cells gently:** When stripping old solder from reclaimed P42A cans, use carbide burrs, copper braid, or metal cutoff wheels sparingly—overheating the top insulator ruins the cell, so plan for fresh Bak 45D stock if cleanup goes sideways and stage TVS repairs for welders before diving in.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L311-L319】
- **Wrap and isolate cells:** Heat-shrink each 21700, add Kapton plus wax/fish-paper between parallels, sheath the finished pack in epoxy board and giant heat-shrink, and add a cradle strap so it slides in/out without scuffing the deck.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L8927-L8933】
- **Document insulation stacks before sign-off:** Matte’s latest teardown shows Kapton backed with vulcanized fiber between parallels; reviewers now insist on photographing balance-lead routing (“the money shot”) before approving high-current packs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L352-L359】
- **Balance lead soldering:** Flow ~0.5 s of 400 °C heat with solder paste so the copper strip soaks the thermal load—short pulses keep cells cool while locking balance wires into the copper bus.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L8874-L8897】
- **Telemetry cross-checks:** Pair CAN smart BMS data with VESC logs to validate current draw and spot calibration drift in shunt-based readings.[^7]
- **Stay in the longevity window:** Artem keeps commuter packs between roughly 20 % and 85 % (≈3.6–4.1 V/cell) and under 40–45 °C; sag beyond ~3 V or repeated 70 °C peaks can cut lifespan to ~400 cycles.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L698-L699】
- **Probe cells with Kelvin leads.** Alligator clips and single-sense multimeters can show false 1.9 V dips at 20 A; clamp meters across the battery and use four-wire probes directly at the tabs before condemning P42A-class cells.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L605-L605】
- **Finish work around positives:** Deburr nickel edges near cell tops and re-seat fishpaper before closing the pack—sharp tabs have already pierced insulation on low-current power-bank builds.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L122364-L122385】
- **Pair Kapton with structural insulation:** Builders lean on Kapton for moisture resistance, but it lacks thermal shielding—add fish paper or other barriers on high-discharge packs to stop nickel from rubbing bare cans as seen in recent Dualtron teardowns.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L357-L359】
- **Respect connector gender standards:** Keep female shells on live battery leads and reserve male housings for chargers or controller-side harnesses; QS10’s 10 mm bullets support ≈400 A but only if polarity is consistent across every build.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L333-L338】
- **Print holders for heat, not looks.** PLA cradles slump once cells warm; switch to PETG or ASA around 230 °C/100 °C bed temps so 21700 honeycombs and Wildman bag sleds stay rigid in summer decks.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L116230-L116236】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L89665-L89696】
- **Bond prints with non-melting adhesives.** Epoxy, cyanoacrylate, or specialty plastics glue PETG/PLA parts without warping them—ideal for reinforcing phone mounts and pack accessories.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L81-L81】
- **Dress electrodes & stage practice stock.** Glitter 811H rigs reliably join 0.2 mm copper to nickel once the power is dialled back and probe tips are sharpened; builders rehearse on loose strip and dead cells, add a BMS before fielding real packs, and ignore myths that nickel-plated steel is acceptable for high-current copper sandwiches.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L52-L54】
- **Manage KWELD super-cap banks.** Keep parallel capacitor stacks to four modules to avoid over-current faults, use switched resistor banks on dual Meanwell LRS-350-4.2 supplies for charging and bleeding, and plan active cooling because seven heat-shrink layers still leave weld pens too hot for long sessions.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L55-L57】
- **Document capacity checks.** Time OEM chargers (≈1.7 Ah per hour on Xiaomi bricks) when vetting customer packs; a genuine 12 Ah module needs nearly seven hours from empty.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L98595-L98598】
- **Log cell provenance.** Refurb lots from NKON (late-2021 Samsung 35E/50E) arrive graded and safe when treated like fresh stock; track batch codes and keep compression on pouch experiments so swelling doesn’t lift tabs.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L97241-L97259】
- **Layer real insulation—not packing tape.** High-current packs rely on Kapton, dual heat-shrink, fishpaper, and fiberglass tape; SUNKKO clamps keep Sicaflex-potted arrays aligned while the glue cures.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L317-L317】
- **Skip household splice tricks.** WAGO-style blocks and soldering bullets while clamped in heatsinks left brittle joints and scorched insulation; tin leads with ≥40 W irons, keep strip lengths short (~10 mm), and size lighting looms with 16–18 AWG copper instead.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L341-L341】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L330-L330】
- **Translate C-ratings into real amps.** Treat a single 10 AWG lead as a ~100 A conductor and paired 12 AWG wires as roughly 140 A; cross-check cell C-ratings with these limits before promising 20 S Xiaomi builds more current than the harness can carry.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part004.txt†L11470-L11499】
- **Retire WAGO phase adapters.** House-wiring clamps have already melted under 150 A hub loads—swap to soldered joints backed by AS150/EC8 connectors and proper heatshrink before buttoning up the deck.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L366-L366】
- **Calibrate adjustable chargers.** Trim VR1 for output voltage, VR2 for charge current, and VR3 for cutoff while the pack sits partially discharged so you stop guessing and over-driving AliExpress supplies.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L360-L360】
- **Know when BMSs sleep.** Happy BMS packs can latch their discharge MOSFETs off after reconnection; wake them with a brief charger tap before blaming wiring or the controller.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L301-L302】
- **Protect LiPo experiments.** A Daly-protected 4 Ah LiPo sank to 0.5 V per cell when left unattended, killing €120 worth of cells—treat LiPo scooters as supervised builds or upgrade the BMS hardware.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L387-L387】
- **Quarantine failing budget packs immediately:** Bargain eBay modules that vent or reignite during recharge attempts should be submerged in water and scrapped—continued charging risks burning down the entire scooter even in freezing weather.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L325-L329】

### 21700 Dimension Cheat Sheet
- **Samsung 50E:** ≈21.12 mm with wrap.
- **Molicel P42A:** ≈21.34 mm with wrap.
- **Lishen LR21700:** ≈21.4 mm with wrap.
- **LG M58T:** ≈21.6 mm bare / 21.43 mm unwrapped.
- **Takeaway:** Oversize 3D-printed honeycombs and test-fit sacrificial cells; Mirono still ends up sanding fixtures because “21 mm” holders crush real-world cans.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L283-L296】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L290-L290】

### Busbar Fabrication Workflow
- **Skip diode “engraver” shortcuts.** Desktop diode lasers only mark copper—they cannot slice 0.2 mm sheet cleanly—so plan on industrial CO₂ hardware or go manual by drilling relief holes, following the outline with a coping/“leaf” saw, and cleaning edges with heavy-duty shears and files. Budget time rather than gambling on hobby engravers that leave ragged busbars.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L542-L590】
- **Treat high-power lasers like industrial tools.** Multi-kilowatt beams blind observers instantly even off-reflections; any CO₂ upgrade needs full enclosures, interlocks, filtered camera monitoring, and PPE before you power it up next to pack builds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L561-L584】
- **Log copper-on-steel overlay settings.** PuneDir’s trials stacked 0.10 mm copper under 0.15 mm nickel at roughly 60–70 J; recording weld energy, probe spacing, and peel tests helps others repeat the plated-steel recipe without scorching cells.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L517-L517】

### Enclosure Materials & Insulation
- **Treat carbon-fibre PETG as conductive until proven otherwise.** Builders still need proper resistivity tests—keep prints away from live busbars until a megohmmeter confirms the carbon fill won’t leak current at pack voltage.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L506-L506】

### Mounting & Housing Patterns
- **Prototype harness guides cheaply.** Builders mock up deck layouts with cardboard brackets before printing TPU/PETG fixtures, weighing Bambu P1P versus Ender 3 SE ownership while outsourcing large ASA/PEEK parts to avoid €1,500 machines.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L11-L14】
- **Print in-place frames for strength, not speed.** Print-in-place battery sleds need 100 % infill PETG (or stronger) plus fiberglass skins—low-infill PLA softens in the sun and won’t protect the pack in a crash.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L221-L222】
- **Armor deck-mounted conduits.** Twin 10S packs strapped along the deck need metal shielding and permanent wiring—open conduit runs are “self-propelled bombs” unless the housing resists impacts and stays wired for continuous duty.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L230-L234】
- **Overbuild bag brackets.** Wildman bag packs now use eight screw/wide-washer mounts, fiberglass sleeving, and interior foam so cells can’t chafe on hardware or eject during pothole hits.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L361-L362】
- **Expect tight tolerances.** A 13S5P/16S3P 21700 stack just fits a 3 L Wildman when you skip holders, while 13S4P assemblies barely squeeze into 2–3 L shells—plan for custom spacers, cardboard liners, and printed cages before drilling the pack.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L362-L363】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L165-L165】
- **Account for honeycomb growth.** Printed honeycomb holders add roughly 3 cm to a 20 S stick thanks to 1.5 mm walls—verify deck clearance and inspect any shipped pack with crushed heat-shrink or stray metal before trusting it on a ride.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L501-L501】
- **Retire fatigued brackets.** Heavy 13S packs crack 3D-printed rear supports near the rear bolt; inspect and replace printed mounts routinely or swap to metal before pushing high-speed builds.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L352-L352】
- **Budget deck spacers for Zero 10X builds.** 20 S 7 P packs plus dual ESCs fit once you add ≈45 mm of deck spacing; G30 owners manage 18 S 5 P internally, but foam thicker than ~0.5 mm lets cells walk in holderless layouts.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L442-L442】
- **Map Xiaomi sleeper layouts.** Gabe’s 20 S 8 P Pro 2 build splits cells between deck and bag, prints 35–36 mm spacers, reroutes phases, and trims foam so dual controllers and the pack coexist without killing ground clearance.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L476-L476】

### Salvage & Pack Handling Lessons
- **Dyson V8 module recovery.** Vacuum packs mix 20700/21700/18650 cans; Gabe’s teardown shows V8 bricks house 6 s 1 p Molicels that often revive after reflashing the PIC with a Pickit 3 before rewelding the case.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L309-L311】
- **Plan for encapsulated fleet packs.** Ninebot rental batteries bury their BMS inside silicone potting; expect to chisel sealant or swap a fresh board because resets are impossible while encapsulated.[^15]
- **Retire leaky Navee packs.** Salvaged Navee N65 modules have shown leaking cells around 900 km; builders now plan full Aspilsan replacements or scrap the platform rather than risk venting packs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L359-L359】
- **Treat bargain “Ultrafire” packs as a structural hazard.** A fatal elevator blaze traced to an e-bike stuffed with dubious Ultrafire cells reminded the community to isolate DIY packs from living spaces, add vent paths, and respect condo/building bans before charging indoors.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L601-L604】
- **Log Aspilsan thermal limits.** Early A28 tests hit >90 °C at 10–15 A while LG M26 cells on the same rig stayed near 40 °C—don’t parallel chemistries without temperature data.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L15885-L15938】
- **Budget extra time for soldered salvage packs.** Military surplus modules arrived with soldered busbars and even fasteners, forcing full desoldering or dremel work instead of quick bolt removal.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L395-L396】
- **Scrap waterlogged LG M26 stock.** Builders binned cells that took on water rather than risk corrosion-induced failures in new high-capacity packs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L518-L522】
- **Leverage welded 50E clear-outs.** Surplus Samsung 50E modules pre-welded for robots have dropped near $0.80 per cell when you buy 2,000+, making them worthwhile commuters after full inspection and re-termination.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L500-L503】
- **Avoid grinders on aluminum shells.** Score the silicone bead with a utility knife, brace the enclosure in a vise, and drive the cell brick out with a wooden drift from the non-BMS end to preserve wiring.[^16]
- **Treat 0.1 mm nickel stacks like structural parts.** Double layers safely carry ≈20 A BMS currents, but only when bonded with multiple high-energy weld strikes—thin hot glue fails once packs warm.[^17]
- **Triage refurb packs methodically.** Voltage swings on a 2 A charger signal mismatched cell groups—dismantle, capacity/IR-test each cell, regroup by mileage, and expect degraded cells to keep worsening even after balancing.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L333-L333】
- **Invest in training before welding.** Veterans keep Micah Toll’s handbook on the bench so new builders understand failure modes before touching live cells.[^18]
- **Model builds around stock chemistries.** Xiaomi packs routinely ship with LG M26 or blue EVE 18650 cells; use those discharge curves when calculating performance instead of optimistic MJ1 assumptions.[^19]
- **Distribute shoulder-bag loads.** Add thin aluminum plates outside fiberglass fire sleeves to spread weight and shield packs from direct flame when slinging externals over a shoulder.[^20]
- **Store loose cells smartly.** Keep unused cells near 3.3 V in a cool spot and rotate bargain batches quickly—capacity drifts even in storage boxes.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L369-L369】
- **Mount external bags off the swingarm.** Hanging heavy packs from the folding joint beats the steering head to death; bolt shelves to the swingarm so the folding mechanism isn’t bearing the load.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L368-L368】

## Action Checklist
1. **Lock sourcing** – secure cell batches (with customs paperwork) before welding to avoid chemistry mismatches mid-build.[^1][^2]
2. **Stage tooling** – confirm welder calibration with sacrificial strips and schedule maintenance (cleaning, electrode dressing) ahead of production days.[^3][^10]
3. **Model pack fitment** – dry-fit modules in CAD or cardboard using deck measurements (e.g., 48.5 cm × 18.1 cm for Dualtron Achilleus) to plan controller relocation.[^8]
4. **Budget protection gear** – purchase BMS units, fuses, QS8 connectors, and spare harness parts before tariffs or stockouts force redesigns.[^5][^7][^9]
5. **Document performance** – archive discharge/charge test data, weld logs, and thermal profiles so future revisions start from validated baselines.[^1][^6][^10]

[^ip009-compact-bms]: Even cramped 10 S builds drawing 30–45 A per cell rely on JK/JBD 100 A smart boards (with ANT backups) for protection and telemetry.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L36-L36】
[^ip009-ant-down]: Down-populating a 30 S ANT board onto a 22 S harness produced bogus voltages until the pinout and app settings were updated for the shorter stack.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L403-L403】
[^ip009-epoxy]: Zero 10X pack builders slid thin epoxy sheets between balance harnesses and copper busbars when plastic holders would not fit, preserving insulation without added thickness.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L18-L18】
[^ip009-silicone]: Rebuilt honeycomb packs benefited from silicone spacers plus fishpaper or Kapton between series rows when hot gluing groups.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L25-L25】
[^ip009-steel]: Using twin steel strips over nickel supported roughly 8 A per cell in LG M26 packs while keeping 17 P layouts near 10–11 kW.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L26-L26】
[^ip009-copperthick]: Builders reminded AYO that 0.1 mm copper sheet is required for busbars; 0.01 mm foil tears under welding current.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L28-L28】
[^ip009-chamfer]: Copper strip edges near positive terminals can slice insulation under heavy load, so chamfering is now standard before shrink-wrapping.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L30-L30】
[^ip009-holders]: Multiple builders reiterated that tight-tolerance 3D-printed holders (PETG/ASA/ABS) improve spacing and thermal paths over hot glue, especially for long packs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L31-L31】
[^ip009-makaron]: Double-layer “makaron” shrink can replace fishpaper between rows but still scuffs faster, so veterans still prefer fishpaper for series barriers.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L32-L32】
[^ip009-g30]: Squeezing a 20 S 6 P 21700 pack plus twin MP2 controllers into a G30 required a 36 mm deck extender and ~1 mm of grinding around the rail opening.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L34-L34】
[^ip009-fiberboard]: Sliding thin fiberboard into 0.20–0.25 mm copper folds keeps the busbars separated until epoxy spacers land.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part009_review.md†L398-L399】

## Copper Busbar Best Practices
- **Braze copper busbars with shielding gas.** Builders warned that nickel–copper "sandwich" welds oxidize and fail after a few years; brazing with tin while flooding the joint with argon (as micro-TIG stations do) keeps resistance low, whereas humidity alone can trigger corrosion if the pack isn't sealed.[^busbar_braze]
- **Use proper insulation layers, not packing tape.** Battery builders reiterated that Kapton, double heat-shrink, fishpaper, and fiberglass tape are the minimum for high-current packs—clear packing tape alone cannot stop rail wear-through, and purpose-made clamps such as the SUNKKO fixture keep parallel groups aligned while you reglue Sicaflex-potted arrays.[^insulation_layers]
- **20 S 5 P decks demand machining.** Even experienced pack builders said a 20 S 5 P 21700 layout only fits a G30 deck after CNC work; newcomers are steered toward 16–18 S designs or professional builds to avoid compromised clearances and shipping headaches.[^20s5p_fit]

## Cell Internal Resistance Calibration
- **Calibrate 1 kHz AC internal-resistance meters with ~20 mΩ references.** The crew uses wire shunts or resistor networks to zero handheld testers, then expects fresh P42A cells around 8 mΩ, Samsung 50S ≈10 mΩ, first-generation 50E nearer 22–28 mΩ, and abused cells well above that, reminding each other that absolute values drift between instruments even when the relative spread remains useful.[^ir_calibration]
