# DIY Battery Sourcing & Welding Playbook (2025)

## TL;DR
- Grade-A 50PL and P45B cells now define the performance ceiling, but prices swing from €1–1.5 in the EU to ~$9 in the US, so teams must align sourcing tactics with customs realities before scoping pack power levels.[^1][^2]
- Copper spot welding remains the gating competency: bargain 90 € welders rarely prove 0.15 mm claims, while K-Weld or Glitter rigs with proper maintenance reliably join 0.1 mm copper for 22 S packs.[^3][^10]
- Budget worksheets should factor in consumables, BMS headroom, and future tariff shocks (e.g., QS8 connectors drifting toward $35) to avoid mid-build redesigns when scaling beyond 300 A continuous.[^4][^5]

## Cell Market Benchmarks
| Source | Typical Price & Availability | Verified Performance | Procurement Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Stark Varg salvage modules (50PL)** | ≈€1 per cell after labor in Europe | Bench-tested at 60 A discharge / 15 A charge with tight variance | Requires teardown expertise and logistics for pallet shipments.[^1] |
| **NKON / EU wholesalers (50PL)** | €1.5 per cell retail; logos often milled off | Verified as grade A despite shaved markings | Maintain purchase records to satisfy customs queries about rebranded stock.[^2] |
| **US resellers (50PL)** | ~$9 per cell | Same performance as EU stock | Factor in tariffs and shipping; consider freight-forwarding via EU partners.[^2] |
| **Custom P45B/P50B packs** | €3000–€4500 for 22 S 10 P/11 P assemblies | Continuous ≈495 A, BMS peaks ≈1040 A | Group buys enable supply; document BMS limits (≤500 A continuous today).[^6][^7] |
| **Commissioned builds (UK/US)** | Varies; premium vs DIY delta covers tooling | Output tied to builder’s QC logs | Trusted builders like jamessoderstrom eliminate tooling spend for one-off packs.[^11] |

## Welding Equipment Decision Guide
| Scenario | Recommended Tooling | Why It Wins | Follow-Up Checks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| First copper pack, limited budget | Rent/borrow K-Weld or Glitter kit | Proven to fuse 0.1 mm copper reliably versus unproven 90 € units | Inspect weld nuggets under magnification; rip-test samples before scaling.[^3] |
| Daily fabrication shop | Own Glitter 811A or K-Weld with high-current PSU | Handles repeated 4 kA+ hits when contacts are clean | Schedule bus pin cleaning to prevent E01 faults and maintain 4.4 kA output.[^10] |
| Mixed chemistries (pouch + cylindrical) | Use adjustable pulse welders with copper/nickel sandwiches | Controls heat on dissimilar tabs, minimizes swelling risk | Pair with upgraded ≥230 A BMS and temperature probes on parallel groups.[^6] |

## Pack Architecture Case Studies
| Platform | Layout & Cells | Controller Pairing | Lessons |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Dual 70H race scooter | 22 S10/11 P P45B modules | MakerX G300 duals | Logs justify nearly 500 A continuous; plan dual-BMS or fuse strategy until 700 A-class boards exist.[^4][^7] |
| Dualtron Achilleus | 20 S8 P Molicel / 22 S9 P custom | Spintend 85250 relocated outside deck | Deck measures ≈48.5 cm × 18.1 cm—external controller mounting frees volume for ≥100 A batteries.[^4][^8] |
| Nami commuter upgrade | 22 S10 P layout in development | Awaiting high-current controllers | CNC + 3D-printed supports required; treat as modular sled to service 50PL packs.[^12] |
| G3 30 S conversion | 30 S3 P modules (15 S6 P split) | High-voltage VESC | Requires grinding factory brackets; 30 S4 P too wide without chassis surgery and new BMS routing.[^13] |
| 20 S10 P Samsung 40T | Dual Ubox 85250 | 0.2 mm copper busbars deliver ~350 A continuous / 450 A burst; avoid mixing pouch cells in parallel due to swelling | Reserve space for ≥230 A BMS and monitor temps during 40 kW pulls.[^6] |

## Cost Planning Worksheet
1. **Cell procurement** – price the primary chemistry plus 10 % spares for grading losses and future replacements.[^2][^11]
2. **Interconnects & welding** – include copper/nickel, insulation, weld probe maintenance, and PPE alongside the welder cost or rental fees.[^3][^10]
3. **BMS & protection** – today’s compact boards cap around 500 A continuous; large packs may need dual-BMS or fuse-plus-charge solutions until 700 A hardware lands.[^7]
4. **Connectors & harnessing** – QS8 connectors, 8–10 AWG silicone wire, and panel mounts are trending upward in price due to tariffs—stockpile early.[^5][^9]
5. **Enclosure & structural supports** – CNC plates, 3D spacers, and adhesives trump hot glue for 22 S builds; treat mechanical retention as part of the electrical budget.[^8][^14]
6. **Labor or outsourcing** – weigh the tooling investment against commissioning vetted builders when customs, shipping, or learning curves threaten schedules.[^11]

## QA & Maintenance Protocols
- **Thermal interface audits:** Log controller and stator temperatures on first shakedown runs; resurface heatsink plates and refresh thermal paste before chasing 400 A+ per motor.[^9]
- **Weld verification:** Rip-test sample strips each session, especially after cleaning Glitter bus pins, to confirm energy settings haven’t drifted.[^10]
- **Harness strain relief:** Use deck plates or external mounts to keep relocated controllers from stressing phase leads and QS8 connectors during pack swaps.[^8][^9]
- **Telemetry cross-checks:** Pair CAN smart BMS data with VESC logs to validate current draw and spot calibration drift in shunt-based readings.[^7]

## Action Checklist
1. **Lock sourcing** – secure cell batches (with customs paperwork) before welding to avoid chemistry mismatches mid-build.[^1][^2]
2. **Stage tooling** – confirm welder calibration with sacrificial strips and schedule maintenance (cleaning, electrode dressing) ahead of production days.[^3][^10]
3. **Model pack fitment** – dry-fit modules in CAD or cardboard using deck measurements (e.g., 48.5 cm × 18.1 cm for Dualtron Achilleus) to plan controller relocation.[^8]
4. **Budget protection gear** – purchase BMS units, fuses, QS8 connectors, and spare harness parts before tariffs or stockouts force redesigns.[^5][^7][^9]
5. **Document performance** – archive discharge/charge test data, weld logs, and thermal profiles so future revisions start from validated baselines.[^1][^6][^10]
