# Lithium Battery Shipping Compliance Guide

## Overview

Shipping lithium batteries requires strict compliance with international regulations (ADR/IATA). This guide covers the legal requirements, carrier selection, documentation needs, and risk mitigation strategies for safely and legally shipping lithium battery packs.

## What You Need to Know

- Undeclared lithium shipments expose you to severe liability
- EU ADR/IATA rules require full declaration and certification
- Ground carriers are practical for most workshop-scale packs
- Documentation and proper classification are mandatory
- Penalties for violations can reach six figures

## Why Compliance Matters

### Legal Liability

**Severe Consequences**:[^1]
- UPS and other carriers will transport lithium freight
- **BUT**: Fire on undeclared parcel = six-figure damages charged to sender
- Full declaration, certification, and safety advisor often required
- EU ADR/IATA rules strictly enforced

> **⚠️ Critical Warning**: Do not ship lithium batteries without proper declaration. The financial and legal consequences of a fire are severe.

### Regulatory Landscape

**Increasing Scrutiny**:[^4]
- European resellers demand UL-certified packs
- Pending regulations mirror U.S. safety pushes
- Document compliance before exporting DIY assemblies
- Standards tightening across regions

## Classification & Documentation

### Determine Your UN Classification

**Two Main Categories**:[^5]
1. **UN3480**: Lithium batteries alone
2. **UN3481**: Lithium batteries packed with equipment

**Required Paperwork**:
- ADR/IATA forms (appropriate for classification)
- MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet)
- Test summaries
- Include with every parcel

### Safety Advisor Requirement

**EU Shippers**:[^5]
- Often need third-party DG (Dangerous Goods) consultants
- Required to sign paperwork
- Factor fees into pricing
- Budget longer booking windows

## Carrier Selection

### Ground Carriers (Recommended)

**Practical Options**:[^2][^3]
- **DPD**: Intra-EU deliveries (excludes Norway)
- **UPS**: EU routes
- **TNT**: EU ground services

**Why Ground**:[^2]
- DHL and other air carriers refuse untreated lithium
- Ground shipping more reliable for batteries
- Lower regulatory hurdles

### Air Carrier Restrictions

**General Rule**:[^2]
- Most air carriers refuse lithium freight
- Untreated batteries almost always rejected
- Special hazmat air freight exists but expensive

### Route Limitations

**Geographic Restrictions**:[^3][^9]
- DPD: Intra-EU only (Norway blocked)
- Some regions: Kuwait, Norway have restrictions
- Check destination rules before shipping

## Shipping Timelines

### Typical Delivery Windows

**Denis's Experience**:[^7]
- EU deliveries: ~10 days
- Build packs early in week
- Hand to courier mid-week
- Buffer time for documentation checks
- Global shipments take longer

**Plan Accordingly**:
- Don't promise fast delivery
- Set realistic customer expectations
- Account for documentation review

## Cost Considerations

### VAT & Customs

**AliExpress IOSS System**:[^8]
- Collects 21-24% VAT upfront on sub-€150 parcels
- Removes €10-€24 postal handling fees
- Many EU buyers benefit
- Large orders still face full duties

### Shipping Method Costs

**Comparison**:[^12][^ip001-freight]
- National post: ~€15 (controllers)
- DHL/UPS: €60-€80
- **Heavy motors** (9-10kg):
  - Rail: $90-$165
  - Air: $160-$203
  - Plus ~€500 customs on resale stock

**EMS Issues**: Recently bounced electronics from Guangzhou, expect rerouted shipments

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Separate Batteries from Electronics

**When Regulations Block Lithium**:[^9]
- Ship electronics-only kits
- Let customers source packs locally
- Avoids customs seizures
- Complies with regional restrictions

**Example Regions**:
- Kuwait
- Norway  
- Other restricted destinations

### Remote Location Challenges

**Dualtron GT2 Example**:[^dualtron-ship]
- European builders skipping remote purchases
- Lithium restrictions add cost and delay
- Fabricating custom parts locally instead
- Keeps 80H motor projects alive

### Personal-Use Import Network

**Trusted Intermediaries**:[^10][^yamal-korea]
- Example: Yamal forwarding cells to South Korea
- Personal parcels via established networks
- Still requires paperwork
- Potential for border scrutiny

**Use Case**: Jason sourcing Samsung 40T/50S packs into South Korea

## Documentation Best Practices

### Keep Comprehensive Records

**Essential Documents**:[^11][^5]
- Declarations
- MSDS sheets
- Carrier acknowledgements
- Proves due diligence if incident occurs
- Denis captures during manual payment reconciliation

### Stock Outage Management

**Communication Channels**:[^3]
- Newsletters
- Storefront notices
- Reset customer expectations
- Common issues:
  - Charger shortages
  - Bag delays
  - Hazmat paperwork slowdowns

## Brexit & Regional Issues

### UK Lithium Parcels

**Ongoing Challenges**:[^rita_shipping_delays]
- Routinely stalled or returned
- Even non-battery shipments affected
- Canada sometimes clears faster than EU
- UK builders use local fabricators (e.g., Tudor)
- Petitions for broader legalization ongoing

### Semiconductor Bottlenecks

**Supply Chain Impact**:[^rita_shipping_delays]
- Rita adapters hit delays (March 2021)
- Smart packs affected
- Chip shortages compound lithium restrictions

## Airline Travel with Batteries

### Passenger Carry-On Limits

**Watt-Hour Cap**:[^air-100wh]
- Airlines limit carry-on to ~100Wh
- Veterans plan ground shipping instead
- Or line up rental scooters at destination
- Don't gamble with oversized packs at security

### Draining Large Externals

**For Air Travel**:[^14]
- Example: 24Ah pack drained to 30%
- Spent ~70km riding to discharge
- Used incandescent lamps for final drain
- Plan time for discharge
- Need proof-of-compliance paperwork

## Packaging & Handling

### Reinforce Parcels

**Ground Handling Reality**:[^ground-handling]
- Approved couriers can still drop boxes
- Use hard cases
- Honest declarations reduce risk
- Dropped shipment can ignite in transit

### Payment Protection

**Buyer Protection**:[^13]
- AliExpress disputes idle for months
- Example: Mirono's €80 controller "processing" indefinitely
- Use PayPal or chargeback-friendly cards
- Document faulty components aggressively
- Retain leverage in disputes

## Regional Compliance Watch

### Spain (2024-2027 Crackdown)

**Regulatory Changes**:[^15]
- Cheap Xiaomi clones being banned
- Issues: Flimsy 110mm rotors, bargain electronics
- Fires triggered regulatory action
- By 2027: Must use plated, certified models
- Xiaomi 4 series compliant

### Israel

**Importer License Rule**:[^israel-import]
- Enthusiasts import RM-class scooters as parts
- Source batteries locally
- Unless holding importer permit
- Stretches timelines and budgets

### UK & Australia

**Tight Logistics**:[^uk_aus_shipping]
- Difficult to ship lithium into UK or Australia
- UK builders use local fabricators
- Community pushing for legalization
- Plan local sourcing

## DDP Services

**Duty/Tax Pre-Payment**:[^ip001-freight]
- Hobbyists use DDP to dodge VAT
- Importing personal builds
- Cleaner customs process
- Higher upfront cost
