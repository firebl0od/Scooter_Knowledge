# Lithium Battery Shipping Compliance Brief

## Why It Matters
- Undeclared lithium consignments expose shippers to severe liability: Denis’ crew reminds builders that EU ADR/IATA rules still require full declaration, certification, and often a contracted safety advisor—UPS will carry the freight, but a fire on an undeclared parcel can result in six-figure damages charged back to the sender.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L188-L193】
- Ground carriers remain the practical option for most workshop-scale packs. Denis routinely leans on DPD/UPS/TNT for EU routes because DHL and other air carriers refuse untreated lithium freight, and even DPD limits batteries to intra-EU deliveries (blocking Norway, for example).【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L33-L33】【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L138-L138】
- European resellers increasingly demand UL-certified battery packs and expect pending regulation to mirror U.S. safety pushes, so document compliance artifacts before exporting DIY assemblies.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L58-L58】

## Compliance Checklist
1. **Classify the shipment correctly.** Determine UN3480 vs. UN3481 status, complete the corresponding ADR/IATA paperwork, and include MSDS plus test summaries with every parcel.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L188-L193】
2. **Book carriers that accept lithium.** Confirm the route stays on approved ground services (e.g., DPD within the EU) or specialty hazmat carriers; expect to split electronics from packs when destination rules prohibit combined freight.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L138-L138】【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L29-L29】
3. **Budget for safety advisors and certification.** EU shippers often need third-party DG consultants to sign paperwork; factor those fees and longer booking windows into lead-time promises to customers.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L188-L193】
4. **Communicate timelines transparently.** Denis quotes roughly ten-day EU delivery windows and longer global waits because he builds packs early in the week, hands them to ground couriers mid-week, and buffers time for documentation checks.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L29-L33】

## Risk Mitigation
- **Separate batteries from accessories.** When regulations block lithium exports to a region (e.g., Kuwait or Norway), ship electronics-only kits and leave customers to source packs locally to avoid customs seizures.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L27-L27】
- **Document every parcel.** Keep copies of declarations, MSDS sheets, and carrier acknowledgements so you can prove due diligence if an incident occurs; Denis captures these records alongside order IDs during manual payment reconciliation.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L150-L150】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L188-L193】
- **Plan for stock outages.** Charger shortages, bag delays, and hazmat paperwork slowdowns can halt complete-kit sales; maintain communication channels (newsletters, storefront notices) to reset expectations before customers escalate.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L138-L138】
