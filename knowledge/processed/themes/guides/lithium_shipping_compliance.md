# Lithium Battery Shipping Compliance Brief

## Why It Matters
- Undeclared lithium consignments expose shippers to severe liability: Denis’ crew reminds builders that EU ADR/IATA rules still require full declaration, certification, and often a contracted safety advisor—UPS will carry the freight, but a fire on an undeclared parcel can result in six-figure damages charged back to the sender.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L188-L193】
- Ground carriers remain the practical option for most workshop-scale packs. Denis routinely leans on DPD/UPS/TNT for EU routes because DHL and other air carriers refuse untreated lithium freight, and even DPD limits batteries to intra-EU deliveries (blocking Norway, for example).【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L33-L33】【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L138-L138】
- European resellers increasingly demand UL-certified battery packs and expect pending regulation to mirror U.S. safety pushes, so document compliance artifacts before exporting DIY assemblies.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L58-L58】

## Compliance Checklist
1. **Classify the shipment correctly.** Determine UN3480 vs. UN3481 status, complete the corresponding ADR/IATA paperwork, and include MSDS plus test summaries with every parcel.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L188-L193】
2. **Book carriers that accept lithium.** Confirm the route stays on approved ground services (e.g., DPD within the EU) or specialty hazmat carriers; expect to split electronics from packs when destination rules prohibit combined freight.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L138-L138】【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L29-L29】
3. **Budget for safety advisors and certification.** EU shippers often need third-party DG consultants to sign paperwork; factor those fees and longer booking windows into lead-time promises to customers.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L188-L193】
4. **Communicate timelines transparently.** Denis quotes roughly ten-day EU delivery windows and longer global waits because he builds packs early in the week, hands them to ground couriers mid-week, and buffers time for documentation checks.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L29-L33】
- **Expect VAT collection shifts.** AliExpress’ adoption of IOSS now collects ~21–24 % VAT upfront on sub-€150 parcels while removing €10–€24 postal handling fees for many EU buyers, softening customs shocks for controllers and cell batches even though large orders still face full duties.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L212-L212】

## Risk Mitigation
- **Separate batteries from accessories.** When regulations block lithium exports to a region (e.g., Kuwait or Norway), ship electronics-only kits and leave customers to source packs locally to avoid customs seizures.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L27-L27】
- **Leverage trusted intermediaries for personal-use imports.** Riders struggling with formal customs (e.g., Jason sourcing Samsung 40T/50S packs into South Korea) now lean on EU partners like Yamal who can forward cells as personal parcels via established transport networks, but they still plan for paperwork and potential scrutiny at the border.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part011.txt†L19334-L19379】
- **Document every parcel.** Keep copies of declarations, MSDS sheets, and carrier acknowledgements so you can prove due diligence if an incident occurs; Denis captures these records alongside order IDs during manual payment reconciliation.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L150-L150】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L188-L193】
- **Plan for stock outages.** Charger shortages, bag delays, and hazmat paperwork slowdowns can halt complete-kit sales; maintain communication channels (newsletters, storefront notices) to reset expectations before customers escalate.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L138-L138】
- **Budget postal routes accordingly.** Returning a controller via national post cost roughly €15 versus €60–€80 with DHL/UPS, but EMS recently bounced electronics out of Guangzhou—expect rerouted shipments when mail centres tighten lithium rules.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L399-L399】
- **Pay with strong buyer protection.** AliExpress disputes can idle for months—Mirono’s €80 controller sat at “processing” indefinitely—so the crew now favours PayPal or chargeback-friendly cards and documents faulty halls or motors aggressively to retain leverage.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L401-L404】

## Regional Compliance Watch
- **Spain’s 2024–2027 crackdown.** Cheap Xiaomi clones with flimsy 110 mm rotors and bargain electronics triggered fires and are being banned; by 2027 riders must shift to plated, certified models such as the Xiaomi 4 series to stay legal.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L410-L410】
