# Long-Range Touring & Public Charging Guide

## TL;DR
- Multi-hundred-mile scooter tours are feasible with proper pack sizing (≥5 kWh), thermal management, and access to Level 2 EV charging infrastructure, but riders must plan charging etiquette, adapter compatibility, and backup power strategies before leaving home base.[^tour-viable][^ev-infra]
- Public charging demands J1772 adapters, protocol triggers for Tesla plugs (FoCcci boards or equivalent), and awareness that app-locked stations typically release only one handle per session—coordinate with EV drivers and respect charging bay time limits.[^j1772][^tesla-protocol]
- Generator-assisted touring remains experimental; a 1 kW portable generator paired with a 5+ kWh pack could theoretically support coast-to-coast attempts, but weight, noise, and reliability trade-offs need field validation before serious planning.[^generator]

## Long-Range Riding Benchmarks
- Noname logged an 18-hour Appalachian ride covering roughly 150 miles at 50 mph bursts, noting the VESC stayed cool and demonstrating that high-capacity packs (likely 10+ kWh class given the distance) enable extended touring when thermal management is dialed in.[^appalachian]
- Pack sizing for 150+ mile rides typically requires 7–10 kWh or more depending on terrain, speed, and rider weight; builders planning tours should log Wh/mi consumption during shorter test rides to estimate realistic range before committing to long routes.[^pack-sizing]

## Public Charging Strategies

### Level 2 EV Infrastructure
- J1772 adapters allow scooter packs to draw from public Level 2 pedestals, supporting charge rates from as low as 2 A (for emergency trickle charging) up to the pack's BMS limit when paired with appropriate cables and adapters.[^j1772]
- App-controlled charging stations (ChargePoint, Blink, etc.) typically release only one charging handle per session, so riders planning group tours must coordinate with EV drivers or use multiple stations to charge simultaneously.[^app-locks]
- Tesla destination chargers and Superchargers require protocol triggers such as FoCcci boards to initiate handshake sequences; without these adapters, the plug will not energize even with a physical J1772 adapter installed.[^tesla-protocol]

### Charging Etiquette & Best Practices
1. **Respect charging bay time limits.** Move scooters promptly once charged to free stations for EV drivers who often have fewer alternatives than scooter riders with portable packs.[^etiquette]
2. **Communicate charge rate expectations.** Inform station operators or fellow users when drawing only 2–3 A for safety testing versus full-rate charging to avoid confusion about bay availability.[^charge-rate]
3. **Plan for single-handle sessions.** Budget extra time when touring in groups, as most app-based systems won't release multiple handles simultaneously from the same account.[^app-locks]
4. **Monitor thermal margins.** Long charging sessions at high rates (≥6 A per pack) can heat cells and BMS hardware, so log temperatures and adjust charge current if ambient temps exceed 30 °C or packs show elevated thermal readings.[^thermal-charging]

### Adapter & Hardware Recommendations
- **J1772 to scooter pack adapter:** Verify pin compatibility, voltage range (most scooters charge at 48–100 V), and current rating before purchasing or fabricating custom adapters.
- **FoCcci or equivalent Tesla protocol board:** Required for Tesla plug compatibility; confirm firmware version supports your charging voltage before field deployment.
- **Portable multimeter and voltage monitor:** Essential for verifying station output voltage and diagnosing adapter issues before connecting expensive battery packs.

## Generator-Assisted Touring (Experimental)
- A 1 kW portable generator paired with a 5+ kWh pack has been theorized for coast-to-coast scooter attempts, potentially providing 8–10 hours of riding per fuel tank when charging on-the-go at low rates.[^generator]
- Weight penalties (generator, fuel, mounting hardware) and noise considerations make this strategy impractical for urban routes or stealth camping scenarios; field testing is needed before committing to this approach for serious tours.[^generator-limits]
- Backup charging bricks (3–5 A rated) remain more practical for overnight hotel stops or emergency trickle charging when infrastructure is unavailable.[^backup-chargers]

## Pack & BMS Considerations for Touring
- **Over-provision capacity:** Plan for 20–30 % reserve capacity to account for voltage sag, cold weather, headwinds, and unexpected detours; aggressive riders logging 2 Wh/mi at 30 mph should budget ≥3 Wh/mi for tour planning.[^capacity-buffer]
- **BMS thermal limits:** High-capacity packs (≥7 kWh) under sustained discharge can heat BMS MOSFETs or balance boards; log temps during test rides and add active cooling if boards exceed 50 °C under load.[^bms-thermal]
- **Charge rate planning:** If fast-charging via Level 2 infrastructure, ensure BMS charge current limits (typically 10–30 A for scooter-class hardware) match adapter capabilities and won't trip thermal or over-current protections.[^charge-limits]

## Safety & Reliability Tips
1. **Test all charging adapters at home before departure.** Verify voltage, current draw, and thermal behavior with a multimeter and infrared thermometer during bench charging sessions.[^pre-test]
2. **Carry backup charging bricks and cables.** Hotel outlets and standard 120 V receptacles remain the most reliable fallback when public infrastructure is unavailable or malfunctioning.[^backup]
3. **Log ride telemetry and charging sessions.** Track Wh consumed per mile, charge times, and thermal peaks to refine future tour plans and identify pack degradation early.[^telemetry]
4. **Plan routes with charging station density in mind.** Use PlugShare or ChargePoint maps to identify backup stations within 20–30 miles of primary stops in case of equipment failure or station downtime.[^route-planning]

## Follow-Up Actions Needed

- Document field-tested J1772 adapter builds (wiring, fusing, voltage range) to provide builders with reproducible charging solutions.[^follow-adapter]
- Validate generator-assisted touring feasibility with real-world weight, noise, and reliability data before promoting as a viable long-distance strategy.[^follow-generator]
- Capture thermal management strategies for multi-hour charging sessions at public stations, including active cooling thresholds and BMS temperature monitoring.[^follow-thermal]
