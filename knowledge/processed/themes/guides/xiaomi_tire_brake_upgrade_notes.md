# Xiaomi Tire, Brake & Handling Upgrade Notes

## Tire Selection & Pressures

- **10" pneumatic upgrades:** CST 10×2.25, Wanda 10×2, and Xuancheng casings deliver the best grip once inflated toward 3.5–4.2 bar; running them near 36 psi dulls the expected 12 S speed gains and risks fender rub until clearances are checked.[^1][^2][^3]
  - Genuine Xuancheng tires reuse the stock 8.5" tube, run happily around 45–50 psi, and last roughly 700 km—verify the factory label to avoid counterfeit casings.[^xuancheng_factory]
- Commuters chasing comfort keep pairing 10" pneumatics with quality suspension (Konyk, dual-air setups) and warn that Monorim-branded solid tires remain a crash hazard even at moderate speeds.[^denis-comfort]
- **Skip gimmicks like water-filled tires.** Heavy riders chasing winter stability simply pump CST V3 casings toward 5 bar or move to 10" Xuancheng/9×2 off-road tread, trading a touch of range for rim protection and predictable grip.[^denis-5bar]
- **Pair 10×3 tires with real braking.** Denis’ crew still insists on higher pressures and sorted brakes before loading faster firmware maps on 10×3 upgrades.[^denis-10x3-brake]
- **Heavy riders run 10×3 above 45 psi without blowouts.** 100 kg commuters are holding those pressures safely but warn that suspension and braking upgrades must keep pace as speeds climb.[^denis-10x3-psi]
- **Artem’s 10-inch benchmark:** PMT 10×3 remains the gold-standard VSETT tire at roughly 48 psi, with CST 10×3 the value pick.
  - just remember the CST bead runs small, so seat it evenly to avoid wobble.[^4]
- **Premium compound trade-offs:** PMT E-Fire 10×3 radials land around $175 per pair shipped from Italy, while PMT Stradales can feel skittish on Weped frames where softer Shinko rubber hooks up better.
  - budget tire swaps accordingly.[^5]
- **CST tubeless quirks:** CST 10×3 tubeless casings stay popular for cost and availability but bulge into an egg shape on narrow VSETT rims even though ride comfort remains acceptable.[^6]
- **Avoid counterfeit slicks:** Riders continue binning fake PMT casings and cheap Wanda/Deli knock-offs because the clones arrive misshapen, tear at the inner bead, and flatten within weeks even when they technically fit Xiaomi rims.
  - budget for Ulip, CST, or genuine PMT rubber instead of gambling on clones.[^7]
- **Budget slick experiments:** Haku’s $19 slicks sit flush on Peak G30 rims, run quietly, and throw heavy burnout smoke, but he only expects a couple hot-weather weeks of life before swapping to harder-compound PMTs.[^haku-slicks]
- **Regional Sava slick sourcing:** Yamal found 90 mm Sava slicks through local motorcycle shops; they’re beefier than Ulip tyres yet still trail PMT T41/Juniors for outright grip and remain scarce on AliExpress.[^sava-slick]
- **Stradale Junior vs. regular:** Noname and skrtt logged that PMT Stradale Juniors grip harder yet flatten quickly under straight-line riding, so they’re waiting on new rims to keep daily-driver profiles round.[^pmt-stradale]
- **Solid vs. pneumatic:** Riders report roughly 20 % higher energy use, harsher ride quality, and accelerated fatigue on battery tabs when solid tires replace pneumatics.
  - reserve solids for short-range emergency duty.[^8][^denis-solid-danger]
- **10" pneumatic upgrades:** CST 10×2.25, Wanda 10×2, and Xuancheng casings deliver the best grip once inflated toward 3.5–4.2 bar; heavier riders specifically favour CST V3 and Wanda shells with thicker tubes, while running them near 36 psi dulls the expected 12 S speed gains and risks fender rub until clearances are checked.[^1][^9][^2][^3]
- **Case-specific fit notes:** CST 10×2.25 carcasses often need rim sanding, Kenda-branded 152 mm casings mount tight, and Wanda 10×2 options stay grippy at ~4.2 bar while outlasting ultra-soft red compounds.[^10]
- **Solid vs. pneumatic:** Riders report roughly 20 % higher energy use, harsher ride quality, and accelerated fatigue on battery tabs when solid tires replace pneumatics.
  - reserve solids for short-range emergency duty.[^11][^8]
- **Monorim solid tires deform under torque:** Preheat stubborn solids around 100 °C and recruit a helper for installation, but most owners ultimately switch back to pneumatic or alternative compounds for better feel.[^monorim_solid]
- **Solid vs. pneumatic:** Riders report roughly 20 % higher energy use, harsh ride quality, and accelerated battery-tab fatigue on solid tires; Denis’ crew now calls 9.5-inch solids dangerous and steers commuters toward quality pneumatic or tubeless casings instead.[^8][^12]
- **Valve and rim prep:** Monorim 500 W hubs ship without valve holes; drill carefully and add angled stems before installing tubes. Sand thick CST beads or rim casting bumps so 10" conversions seat evenly and avoid wobble. Blade owners even notch the split rim so a beefier Schrader clears the casting.
  - valve extensions help you inflate but still expect to relieve metal around the stem on compact rims.[^9][^3][^13]
- **CST 10×2.5″ remains the go-to pneumatic swap** for Pro/1S scooters, but cloning Monorim suspension geometry or mixing Sharkset hardware demands careful bolt sizing and occasional metalwork so travel stays smooth.[^cst_go_to]
  - reserve solids for short-range emergency duty and treat them as unsafe above ~20 km/h.[^11][^8][^denis-solid-warning]
- **Solid vs. pneumatic:** Riders report roughly 20 % higher energy use, harsh ride quality, and accelerated battery-tab fatigue on solid tires; Denis’ crew now calls 9.5-inch solids dangerous and steers commuters toward quality pneumatic or tubeless casings instead.[^8][^12]
- **Valve and rim prep:** Monorim 500 W hubs ship without valve holes; drill carefully and add angled stems before installing tubes. Sand thick CST beads or rim casting bumps so 10" conversions seat evenly and avoid wobble. Blade owners even notch the split rim so a beefier Schrader clears the casting.
  - valve extensions help you inflate but still expect to relieve metal around the stem on compact rims.[^9][^3][^13]
  - oversize 10 in CST casings on 155 mm rims usually need 2–2.5 mm of machining for a safe bead seat—grind the rim, not the tire carcass, to avoid micro-cuts that later explode at speed.[^denis-cst-machining]
- **Tube prep:** 10 × 2.5 in tubes want 45° or 90° stems plus talcum-powder dusting to prevent valve tearing, and front Xuancheng casings tend to wear faster than rears—commuters budget replacements around 1 500 km.[^denis-tube-care]
- **Monorim 500 W hubs accept air tires.** Swap the stock solid for CST 10×2.5 or 10×3 rubber before raising power—they fit the rim and instantly tame the sketchy factory tire.[^denis-monorim-air]
- **Budget hub sourcing:** Blade-branded Longyu 60 V motors are landing around €180 each (hub only), but factor in rim/tire costs and scarce Weped-spec 75 mm variants.
  - forwarders or local dealers often bundle tires to avoid inflated AliExpress freight.[^14]
- **Dropout prep for VSETT hubs:** Reversing Monorim swingarms, drilling fresh axle slots, and trimming dropouts for security washers are mandatory when fitting VSETT 10+ hubs; bent retainers or cheap sliders won’t hold torque without that rework.[^15]
- **Match tire to rim width:** Stretching 6"-wide casings over 6.1" rims left beads off-center, valves fouled, and fenders rubbing; source true 155 mm tires or machine rims instead of forcing a mismatch. Stick with 10×2 tubes inside 10×2.125 casings.
  - 10×2.5 tubes balloon, wrinkle, and feel sketchy even if you manage to bolt the rim halves together.[^16][^17][^18]
- **Plan tubeless upgrades thoughtfully:** Budget Xuancheng slicks work for frugal builds, but riders prefer PMT or Wanda P1069 casings for grip; keep stock Xuancheng fronts until worn, then migrate to true tubeless sets with sealant-safe rims for better stability.[^12]
- **Tubeless conversions remain finicky on high-power hubs.** Expect slow leaks, rim dents, and bead-seat issues unless you machine the rim or return to talc-dusted tubes.[^denis-tubeless-issues]
- **Tubeless slick caution:** Veterans dislike 50 km/h tubeless slick experiments—rim dents or poor sealing dump air instantly, so they steer speed seekers toward CST 10×2.5 or PMT V-pattern tires unless the rim is meticulously sealed with slime and inspected after jumps.[^denis-slicks]
- **Bin out-of-round bargains.** Builders junk visibly lopsided 10" casings instead of grinding rubber.
  - reputable ULIP and PMT sets seat correctly on 6.1" rims even if they cost more.[^19][^20]
- **Pressure by load:** Heavy riders stabilize handling by targeting ≈4 bar rear / 3.5 bar front once mudguard brackets and wiring are rerouted for the taller rubber.[^2]
- **10" vs. 8.5" debate:** August workshop notes show consensus in favour of 10" pneumatic conversions for smoother rides and slightly higher top speed, provided braking upgrades keep pace, yet some riders revert to 8.5" rubber with Monorim V2 when XuanCheng 10" casings introduce S-shaped wobbles or pogoing on rough pavement.[^21][^22]
- **10×3 conversions need real suspension.** Even dual shocks couldn’t tame solid 10×2.5 tires, pushing riders back to CST 3" air casings or custom forks when chasing that footprint.[^ten_by_three]
- **Bearing choice:** SKF-style 2RS bearings seal better than 2Z shields when you expect wet rides, keeping grit out of Xiaomi and Monorim hubs.[^23]
- **Track pressures:** PMT 10×3 slicks settle around 2.4 bar for general track duty, Vsett racers push 3.5 bar, and dropping to 1.8 bar shreds cords.
  - log rider weight alongside PSI when tuning Xiaomi race builds.[^24][^25]
- **Validate oversized fitment.** 11×3″ tyres reportedly clear Monorim 6″ forks up front, but the rear still needs axle extenders.
  - measure before ordering expensive rubber.[^26]
- **Pre-ride cold checks:** Moving a warmed scooter into sub-zero air can deflate tubeless 10" casings through thermal contraction, so top pressures before rolling out in winter to keep grip consistent.[^27]
- **Winter tread picks:** Riders facing snow lean on 10×2 tubeless off-road casings or Amalibay 9.2" treaded tires sourced from AliExpress; they warn studded DIY conversions chew through thin scooter rubber if screws ever touch bare pavement.[^winter-offroad][^winter-amalibay]
- **Cold-weather range reality:** Expect slower top speeds and shortened range below freezing—the chemistry simply slows down even when the tires still hook up.[^winter-range]

## High-Speed Brake & Tire Safeguards

- **Spec fluid and hardware for race temps.** Roscheeee’s custom adapter lets Xiaomi builds stretch to 160–180 mm rotors alongside 10×2.5–10×3.0 or 110/65 tires, but conventional brake fluid boils long before a glowing 700 °C rotor cools—budget premium hydraulics and realistic fade expectations.[^roscheeee]
- **Keep gentle KERS engaged for pad life.** Riders disable throttle-off regen in sport mode but leave lever-activated KERS enabled because it only nets roughly 1 km per 50 km of riding yet saves brake pads on commuter routes.[^denis-kers]
- **Cycle race rubber often.** 80 km/h testers burn through CST and PMT tires quickly; once the carcass heat-soaks, grip collapses even on premium compounds, so stage spare sets and pair them with aramid riding gear for track duty.[^highspeed-rotation]

## Mounting & Sealant Tips

- **PMT casings play nice either way.** They arrive tubeless-ready yet tolerate inner tubes (even CST 10×2.5) and the stiff carcass can limp home deflated long enough to reach a workshop.[^28]
- **Document split-rim wear.** Repeated pothole strikes ovalize rim halves.
  - swap components and log tire experiments until wobble disappears, keeping spare halves and bearings ready for field service.[^29]
- **Service speed counts.** VSETT split rims separate quickly once axle nuts are off, letting techs swap tires or tubes trackside.
  - some rental hubs even bundle drum brakes with the split rims to streamline AWD conversions.[^30]
- Inflate new casings to full pressure to seat beads evenly, then bleed down to your ride PSI.
  - builders saw efficiency losses when they skipped the full-pressure step.[^31]
- Spin the wheel off the ground and watch for tread wobble before blaming balance weights—most vibrations trace back to uneven bead seating.[^32]
- **Warm and center stubborn casings.** Dust rims and tubes with talc, pre-warm Xuancheng/PMT shells with a heat gun, and cinch the tread with zip ties so beads drop into the rim center before levering the tire home.[^33][^34]
- **Pull the brake disc before tackling a puncture.** Removing the rotor prevents scratches, and dusting tubes plus using plastic spoons keeps CST V3 and other 8.5"/10" casings from slicing replacements during reinstallation.[^disc_off_first]
- **Warm and center stubborn casings.** Dust rims and tubes with talc, pre-warm Xuancheng/PMT shells with a heat gun, and cinch the tread with zip ties so beads drop into the rim center before levering the tire home; longer tire irons help avoid tearing beads on tight fits.[^33][^34][^denis-long-irons]
- **Use air volume, not pressure spikes.** Hand pumps stall near 105 psi.
  - seat tubeless tires with high-flow foot pumps, station compressors, or ratchet straps that momentarily seal the beads.[^35]
- **Blast stubborn tubeless beads.** For 11 in conversions, remove the valve core, flood the bead with soapy water, cinch the tread, and dump ~150 psi from a bead bazooka or large compressor.
  - portable inflators lack the airflow. Immediately bleed pressure back toward 50 psi for riding once the bead pops.[^36]
- **Skip improvised “air cannons.”** Ratchet straps and steady 5.5 bar airflow work; pulsed compressors and homemade blasts have flung hoses, damaged hearing, and convinced riders to buy shop-grade 8 bar compressors instead.[^37]
- **Pick aluminum-safe sealants.** Yellow tubeless Slime avoids rim corrosion and plays nicely with PMT/Xuancheng setups; mixing CRC Fix foam with standard Slime violently reacts and coats the wheel in expanding goo.[^38][^39]
- **Tubeless conversions on stock casings leak without upkeep.** When PMT stock dries up, riders retrofit OEM tires with tubeless valves and automotive sealant, but the rims seep unless the sealant is refreshed regularly.
  - plan a maintenance schedule if you go this route.[^40]
- **Rinse tube sealant after seating.** Tube-specific Slime must be flushed from tubeless G30 rims once the bead seals to prevent long-term corrosion and mess inside the wheel.[^41]
- **Use the valves provided with modern tubeless casings.** PMT/Xuancheng tires now ship with tubeless valves that seal without slime.
  - reserve sealant for aluminum-safe formulas if you still want puncture insurance.[^42]
- **Heat and reshape dented rims cautiously.** Small tubeless rim dents can be warmed and hammered flat, but expect to reseal with silicone or swap the tire if the bead still leaks after repairs.
  - suspended G30 builds still need correct tire pressure and post-curb inspections.[^43]
- **Tubeless-on-solid rims is still a headache.** Cutting the bead wire and stuffing in a tube can get you rolling, but veteran builders warn those hybrids can fail at 65 km/h and recommend dish soap, split rims, or professional presses instead of brute force.[^44]
- **Split rims ease roadside swaps.** Premium platforms like Weped pair rubber isolators with dual bolt circles to seal halves, reinforcing why proper hardware matters when chasing airtight builds and debating tubeless versus tube reliability.[^45]
- **True freshly machined rims.** After shaving Xiaomi hubs for 10×2.5″ installs, spin the wheel or use a rubber eraser wheel against a powered axle to remove high spots before final assembly.[^rim_truing_technique]

## Conversion & Fitment Steps

- 10×2.5 tires sized for 6.0 in rims will not seat on Xiaomi’s 6.1 in hubs without machining the shoulder.
  - plan on lathe work or pick narrower casings to avoid sketchy bead fitment.[^46]
- **Expect frame tweaks on smaller models.** Classic M365 and 1S frames often need grinding or bending to clear 10" rubber, while Pro frames typically fit without trimming; file mudguard brackets or flex stays to stop rub.[^frame_tweak]
- **Machine rims for true 10×2.5″ tires.** Shave ≈1.5 mm from Xiaomi rims (lathe preferred), deburr carefully, and swap to curved valves so Monorim forks clear the stem.
  - run 60–65 psi for 90 kg riders and treat wet pavement with caution. Builders chasing 10×3 conversions on the Pro 2 received the same advice along with reminders to upgrade controller MOSFETs/caps before pairing wider rubber with 48 V tunes.[^47][^lathe]
- **Share Blade hub fitment drawings.** Capture axle span, disc offset, and hardware stacks so Xiaomi fork swaps repeat cleanly without re-measuring every shipment.[^blade_drawings]
- **Verify valve orientation and bushing stacks.** PMT 10×3 or CST 10×2 tubes can bind or leak if stems point the wrong way or bushings sit unevenly.
  - check orientation before closing the fork, especially on dual 60H/50H hubs.[^48]
- **Expect PMT 10×3 machining.** Plan to remove roughly 2 mm from the rim sidewalls (or migrate to Dualtron-style rims) before PMT 10×3 carcasses will seat.
  - PMT 10×2.125 rubber still slips onto 6.1" rims without grinding when grip is the only goal.[^49]
- **Open Xiaomi fender clearance.** Countersink the front mudguard bolt, shim the guard up a few millimetres, and brace the rear fender so quality 10" rubber clears on rough roads.[^50]
- **Monorim front mudguards need trimming.** Remove spacer foam, shorten mounting screws, or swap brackets when 10" wheels kiss the guard; a few millimetres of clearance prevents rubbing.[^monorim_mudguard]
- **Keep 10" setups disciplined.** Run Xuancheng casings around 4.0–4.2 bar, dust tubes with talc, and use slime or careful lever work to avoid tube pinch during swaps.[^tire_discipline]
- **Swap to low-profile hardware up front.** Replacing fork bolts with low-head M6 hardware or trimming plastics keeps 10-inch front tires from rubbing the fork after conversions.[^51][^52]
- **Verify valve orientation and bushing stacks.** PMT 10×3 or CST 10×2 tubes can bind or leak if stems point the wrong way or bushings sit unevenly.
  - check orientation before closing the fork, especially on dual 60H/50H hubs.[^53]
- **Protect Monorim hub screws.** When swapping to pneumatics, support the wheel and ease out the five perimeter screws.
  - stripping one ruins the hub. Drill for 90° valves, shield magnets from filings, and rotate the stem ~45° if it still touches the fork.[^monorim-valve]
- **Budget deck extenders for big packs.** Xiaomi Pro 2 builders squeeze 20 S 4 P bricks with extenders while 15 S 4 P remains the fallback.
  - mixed internal/external packs must balance stem weight before chasing 20 S 9 P ambitions.[^54]
- **Stock decks still fit big bricks.** Pulling the honeycomb inserts lets the Pro 2 swallow 12 S 8 P (~96 cells) and even dual QS8 leads, but plan tight 6 AWG bends carefully to avoid rubbing through insulation inside the tunnel.[^55]
- **Keep water out after valve tweaks.** After rotating or bending stems for clearance, reinforce the grommet area so spray can’t wick into the motor cavity during rain rides.[^water-guard]
- **Pair 500 W Monorim hubs with quality air tires.** The workshop cautioned that the 500 W kit feels unsafe on stock rubber.
  - install a modded air tire before feeding it 12 S power so traction matches the torque jump.[^56]
- **Plan frame swaps around rim spacing.** Builders eyeing dual 72 V projects are already stockpiling stiffer Chinese frames, DT2 EX donor shells, and Vsett or Blade swingarms once they secure matching forks and brake adapters for the wider axles.[^57]
- **Respect stem limits before chasing 16 S dual motors.** Veterans warn that stock M365 stems snap when you push dual drives without full chassis reinforcement, dual brakes, suspension, and deck plates.
  - costs that rival a Vsett 9/9+ with safer geometry.[^58]
- **Budget pack volume realistically.** You can squeeze 13 S 6 P into the deck if the controller moves outside, but AWD conversions usually need backpack or rack batteries plus AWG6 cabling, eroding Xiaomi’s portability advantage.[^59]
- **Consider Ninebot frames for big builds.** Builders chasing stealth still love the Xiaomi Pro, yet Ninebot G30 chassis package dual VESCs and large packs more gracefully once stealth is less critical.[^60]
- **Source race-proven tubeless hardware.** Rage Mechanics and RFP rims lock beads under race abuse.
  - document part numbers plus the matching Amass 8 mm connectors so others can replicate the setup without guessing at components.[^61]
- **Respect 17 S upgrade limits.** A 17 S6 P Samsung 40T build demanded dual XT150 phase connectors, meticulous insulation, and tolerance for ~20 V droop through an undersized Daly BMS.
  - plan thicker leads, fresh brakes, and be aware regen on over-voltage packs can spike controllers until the hardware is upgraded.[^62]
- **Charging workarounds matter.** Riders lived with 16 S chargers dialled to ~67 V until programmable supplies arrived, watching pack balance closely because Daly boards refuse to equalise below ~4.18 V per cell on these over-voltage Xiaomi builds.[^63]
- **Transplanting G30 hubs.** Reversing the Monorim fork and extending phase leads lets Xiaomi frames host Ninebot G30 hubs.
  - pair them with stout ESCs and 20 S 9 P packs to chase 100 km/h potential.[^64]

## Brake Packages

- Keep front mechanical or hydraulic brakes dialled even on regen-heavy builds, and back axle nuts with blue Loctite plus lock washers instead of guessing torque on soft aluminum dropouts.[^65]
- Build a Monorim brake adapter template—torque arm profile, shim stack, and bolt lengths—for 140–160 mm discs so installers stop grinding fork legs to clear rotors.[^monorim_adapter]
- **Semi-metallic pads:** Gold-toned semi-metallic pads last longer and maintain bite in rain compared with organic pads bundled with XTech calipers; ceramics run hotter and demand rotor monitoring.[^66]
- **Semi-metallic pads:** Gold-toned semi-metallic pads last longer and maintain bite in rain compared with organic pads bundled with XTech calipers; ceramics run hotter and demand rotor monitoring.[^67][^66]
- **Front-disc conversions:** Aftermarket 500 W hubs need the Monorim adapter plus XTech calipers, and builders routinely replace Monorim’s mis-machined brake/suspension hardware with self-locking fasteners to stop repeated bending failures.[^denis-front-disc]
- **Mind TRP Spyke clearance.** The dual-piston caliper fouls Wheelway 500 W rims on Xiaomi builds; riders downsize the rear brake or switch pad compounds before the housing chews the tire.[^denis-trp-spyke]
- **Rotor sizing:** Community swaps standardize on 135–140 mm rotors for Pro decks and 120 mm for base models when installing X-Tech HB100s or higher-end hydraulics.[^68]
- **Rear-disc conversions:** Konyk 40 mm magnet hubs clear Xiaomi dropouts with 120 mm spacing and accept 180 mm rotors once spacers are machined.
  - capture final washer stacks and torque specs when documenting conversions.[^69]
- **Controller mounting templates:** Community drills for hanging a Ubox 75 V 100 A under the deck rely on threaded inserts plus separate buck converters for 5 V tail lights.
  - document hole spacing and enclosure choices before copying the layout.[^70]
- **Budget alternatives:** Properly adjusted MTB-style mechanical calipers (“Bike Attitude”) can outperform misaligned semi-hydraulics when combined with 135 mm rotors.
  - center the fixed pad before tightening mounts.[^66]
- **SNSC drum adapters:** Inverted SNSC setups need a spacer and both mounting points engaged before the drum aligns.
  - plan fabrication time instead of relying on a single bracket.[^71]
- **Kotto 3 mm motorcycle calipers:** Expect to machine spacers and bleed them immediately.
  - the bite is excellent but the calipers ship thick and dry compared with scooter hydraulics.[^72]
- **Support brake housing runs.** Tie the cable housing to the frame and trim excess length.
  - loose housing eats lever travel and ruins braking force no matter the caliper upgrade.[^73]
- **Chase brake chatter methodically.** Pinched housings under the controller or damaged cable sheaths caused most squeal—refresh the housing, lubricate barrel adjusters, and consider TRP Spyke or NUTT calipers with proper spring tension.[^brake_chatter_diagnostic]
- **Stock brake cables reach.** You can run the OEM cable through 2 m of housing if the scooter lacks rear suspension, keeping routing clean on dual-disc conversions.[^denis-cables]
- **Graduate to full hydraulics for 80 km/h builds.** Xtech hybrids struggle to slow tuned Pro 2 conversions at highway speed; riders switch to Magura-class brakes and add lever sensors if they still want regen without killing lever feel, finishing with a proper bleed after routing new hoses.[^74]
- **Watch Magura clearance.** MT7/MT8 calipers squeezed onto Xiaomi G30 and VSETT frames can lose their <5 mm tire gap as the casing flexes.
  - check clearance regularly, keep spare banjos/hardware, and reconsider external hose reroutes that rub 10×3 tires after flats.[^75]
- **Don’t delete the front brake.** Dual-motor Xiaomi 1S conversions that rely on rear regen plus a single disc are unsafe at speed.
  - budget a second hydraulic front brake once you add the extra hub.[^76]
- **Torque lever bleeds properly.** Magura lever bleed screws only want 0.5 Nm; overtightening strips the threads and dumps pressure mid-ride.[^77]

## Suspension, Wheelbase & Handling Tweaks

- **Free seized front hubs correctly:** Brace the scooter, apply penetrating lube, and use a long rigid wrench instead of soft Monorim tools; replace any rounded bolts with higher-grade hardware once the wheel is off.[^78]
- **Monorim steering bind fix:** Back the centre stem bolt off a quarter turn, loosen the side clamps, or temporarily refit the stock bolt before reinserting the suspension pump when the fork feels sticky after install.[^79]
- **Plan deck routing for 10" conversions:** Relocate rear-light wiring, seal fresh edges with epoxy, and trim mudguard plastics as needed; riders run ≈4 bar rear/3.5 bar front to keep taller rubber clear of the harness.[^80]
- **Use spacer kits with 10×3 swingarms.** Stack the supplied spacers and add thin washers between the fork and hub on Monorim swingarms so 500 W motors don’t rub the tire once inflated.[^denis-monorim-spacers]
- **Keep the deck rib when possible:** Lighter riders sometimes shave the rear rib for tire clearance, but heavier owners prefer leaving it intact and using spacers plus precise tire choices instead.[^81]
- **Move and seal charge ports:** Many riders shift the charge port higher on the stem once 10" tires and rerouted wiring go in, resealing the deck to keep grit out.[^82]
- **Rear suspension stretch:** Bolt-on rear suspension kits extend wheelbase roughly 10 cm, noticeably calming Xiaomi chassis at 35–40 km/h once brake adapters are spaced correctly.[^83][^66]
- **Stem stability:** Pair plastic shims with Foldster X-Lock or Phoenix clamps to eliminate wobble; trim or relocate latch hardware so Wildman battery bags clear the hook without scuffing packs.[^84][^85][^86]
- **Stiffen high-speed steering.** 3D-printed steering-damper brackets tame bar shake around 30 km/h, and hand-built mudguard mounts survive jumps and heavy spray better than stock plastic on faster builds.[^steering_damper_bracket]
- **Source genuine suspension hardware:** 3D-printed supports and lock extender kits improve Wildman bag clearance, but genuine Monorim parts remain scarce and pricier through EU resellers.
  - budget time and cost accordingly.[^87]
- **Lighting integration:** 3D-printed fender supports and extender housings can host sealed LED strips, wireless turn-signal pods, Lumos Matrix helmet mounts, or DIY 12 V strobes.
  - just route wiring inside the bag to protect it from tire splash.[^88][^89]
- **Beam pattern validation:** Budget Towwoo “8000 lm” lights produced narrow hotspots compared with Olight/OSRAM lamps.
  - photograph beam patterns after upgrades so Xiaomi riders can trust claimed lumen figures.[^90]

## Monitoring & Instrumentation

- **Bluetooth temperature logging:** Coin-cell-powered Bluetooth probes provide live pack and ESC temperature data when stress-testing high-power builds.[^91]

## Lighting & Visibility Upgrades

- **Mount signals at eye level:** Helmet or backpack-mounted indicators remain visible in daylight, unlike low fender kits that sit below most drivers’ sightlines.[^92]
- **Harden rear-light wiring:** Reroute the harness, pot exposed joints, hot-glue the tail-light connector after 10" conversions, and add reflective tape or low-profile sticker kits to boost conspicuity without bulky add-ons.[^93][^94]

## Range & Accessory Add-ons

- **Pack for long rides:** Dual 12 S packs tied through multi-pack Rita adapters, anti-spark links, or backpack enclosures can stretch range toward 80 km while keeping total mass around 6 kg.[^95]

## Performance Notes

- **500 W hubs on 12 S:** Swapping to 500 W motors and 12 S packs holds 45–48 km/h on flats without the voltage sag that drags 300 W hubs toward ~44 km/h once heat builds.[^96]
- **Mixed-wheel combos:** Running a 10" front with an 8.5" rear still delivers 48–50 km/h when pack voltage stays high, but inspect hall sensors and brake hardware frequently—neglect leads to repeated ESC failures.[^mixed_wheel_upkeep]

## Vendor & Support Notes

- **Stick with proven shippers.** Voltride earned shout-outs for rapid PMT deliveries, and Mirono keeps steering buyers toward Scootermode or PaoloWu’s 50 mm hub/controller upgrades instead of overpriced MaxMods resellers.[^voltride][^paolowu]

## Setup Checklist

1. **Mock clearances:** Dry-fit the chosen tire and suspension combo, confirming mudguard, brake, and harness spacing before inflating to full pressure.[^9][^2]
2. **Bed brakes:** After any pad or rotor swap, bed the system in with controlled stops to prevent glazing and squeal.
  - especially important for semi-metallic upgrades.[^66]
3. **Retorque hardware:** Recheck axle nuts, adapter bolts, and suspension pivots after the first rides; stretched wheelbases and taller tires settle hardware quickly.[^66][^8]
