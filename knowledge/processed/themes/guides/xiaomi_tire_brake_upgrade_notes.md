# Xiaomi Tire, Brake & Handling Upgrade Notes

## Tire Selection & Pressures
- **10" pneumatic upgrades:** CST 10×2.25, Wanda 10×2, and Xuancheng casings deliver the best grip once inflated toward 3.5–4.2 bar; running them near 36 psi dulls the expected 12 S speed gains and risks fender rub until clearances are checked.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L226-L228】【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L369-L370】【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L696-L696】
- **Artem’s 10-inch benchmark:** PMT 10×3 remains the gold-standard VSETT tire at roughly 48 psi, with CST 10×3 the value pick—just remember the CST bead runs small, so seat it evenly to avoid wobble.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L55-L55】
- **Premium compound trade-offs:** PMT E-Fire 10×3 radials land around $175 per pair shipped from Italy, while PMT Stradales can feel skittish on Weped frames where softer Shinko rubber hooks up better—budget tire swaps accordingly.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L56-L56】
- **CST tubeless quirks:** CST 10×3 tubeless casings stay popular for cost and availability but bulge into an egg shape on narrow VSETT rims even though ride comfort remains acceptable.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L57-L57】
- **Solid vs. pneumatic:** Riders report roughly 20 % higher energy use, harsher ride quality, and accelerated fatigue on battery tabs when solid tires replace pneumatics—reserve solids for short-range emergency duty.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L336-L337】
- **Valve and rim prep:** Monorim 500 W hubs ship without valve holes; drill carefully and add angled stems before installing tubes. Sand thick CST beads or rim casting bumps so 10" conversions seat evenly and avoid wobble. Blade owners even notch the split rim so a beefier Schrader clears the casting—valve extensions help you inflate but still expect to relieve metal around the stem on compact rims.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L337-L338】【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L696-L696】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L512-L521】
- **Budget hub sourcing:** Blade-branded Longyu 60 V motors are landing around €180 each (hub only), but factor in rim/tire costs and scarce Weped-spec 75 mm variants—forwarders or local dealers often bundle tires to avoid inflated AliExpress freight.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L6912-L6963】
- **Dropout prep for VSETT hubs:** Reversing Monorim swingarms, drilling fresh axle slots, and trimming dropouts for security washers are mandatory when fitting VSETT 10+ hubs; bent retainers or cheap sliders won’t hold torque without that rework.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L7093-L7147】
- **Match tire to rim width:** Stretching 6"-wide casings over 6.1" rims left beads off-center, valves fouled, and fenders rubbing; source true 155 mm tires or machine rims instead of forcing a mismatch. Stick with 10×2 tubes inside 10×2.125 casings—10×2.5 tubes balloon, wrinkle, and feel sketchy even if you manage to bolt the rim halves together.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L99284-L99353】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L494-L515】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L543-L547】
- **Pressure by load:** Heavy riders stabilize handling by targeting ≈4 bar rear / 3.5 bar front once mudguard brackets and wiring are rerouted for the taller rubber.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L369-L370】
- **Track pressures:** PMT 10×3 slicks settle around 2.4 bar for general track duty, Vsett racers push 3.5 bar, and dropping to 1.8 bar shreds cords—log rider weight alongside PSI when tuning Xiaomi race builds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L12150-L12156】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L12214-L12226】

## Mounting & Sealant Tips
- **PMT casings play nice either way.** They arrive tubeless-ready yet tolerate inner tubes (even CST 10×2.5) and the stiff carcass can limp home deflated long enough to reach a workshop.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L60-L60】
- **Document split-rim wear.** Repeated pothole strikes ovalize rim halves—swap components and log tire experiments until wobble disappears, keeping spare halves and bearings ready for field service.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L61-L61】
- **Service speed counts.** VSETT split rims separate quickly once axle nuts are off, letting techs swap tires or tubes trackside—some rental hubs even bundle drum brakes with the split rims to streamline AWD conversions.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L62-L62】
- Inflate new casings to full pressure to seat beads evenly, then bleed down to your ride PSI—builders saw efficiency losses when they skipped the full-pressure step.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L131-L131】
- Spin the wheel off the ground and watch for tread wobble before blaming balance weights—most vibrations trace back to uneven bead seating.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L134-L134】
- **Warm and center stubborn casings.** Dust rims and tubes with talc, pre-warm Xuancheng/PMT shells with a heat gun, and cinch the tread with zip ties so beads drop into the rim center before levering the tire home.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L90621-L90637】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L90909-L90921】
- **Use air volume, not pressure spikes.** Hand pumps stall near 105 psi—seat tubeless tires with high-flow foot pumps, station compressors, or ratchet straps that momentarily seal the beads.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L81739-L81819】
- **Blast stubborn tubeless beads.** For 11 in conversions, remove the valve core, flood the bead with soapy water, cinch the tread, and dump ~150 psi from a bead bazooka or large compressor—portable inflators lack the airflow. Immediately bleed pressure back toward 50 psi for riding once the bead pops.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L202-L204】
- **Skip improvised “air cannons.”** Ratchet straps and steady 5.5 bar airflow work; pulsed compressors and homemade blasts have flung hoses, damaged hearing, and convinced riders to buy shop-grade 8 bar compressors instead.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L357-L358】
- **Pick aluminum-safe sealants.** Yellow tubeless Slime avoids rim corrosion and plays nicely with PMT/Xuancheng setups; mixing CRC Fix foam with standard Slime violently reacts and coats the wheel in expanding goo.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L85974-L85997】【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L81862-L81882】
- **Rinse tube sealant after seating.** Tube-specific Slime must be flushed from tubeless G30 rims once the bead seals to prevent long-term corrosion and mess inside the wheel.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L356-L357】
- **Use the valves provided with modern tubeless casings.** PMT/Xuancheng tires now ship with tubeless valves that seal without slime—reserve sealant for aluminum-safe formulas if you still want puncture insurance.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L101765-L101775】
- **Heat and reshape dented rims cautiously.** Small tubeless rim dents can be warmed and hammered flat, but expect to reseal with silicone or swap the tire if the bead still leaks after repairs—suspended G30 builds still need correct tire pressure and post-curb inspections.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L17940-L18007】
- **Tubeless-on-solid rims is still a headache.** Cutting the bead wire and stuffing in a tube can get you rolling, but veteran builders warn those hybrids can fail at 65 km/h and recommend dish soap, split rims, or professional presses instead of brute force.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L493-L498】
- **Split rims ease roadside swaps.** Premium platforms like Weped pair rubber isolators with dual bolt circles to seal halves, reinforcing why proper hardware matters when chasing airtight builds and debating tubeless versus tube reliability.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L498-L501】

## Conversion & Fitment Steps
- 10×2.5 tires sized for 6.0 in rims will not seat on Xiaomi’s 6.1 in hubs without machining the shoulder—plan on lathe work or pick narrower casings to avoid sketchy bead fitment.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L132-L132】
- **Machine rims for true 10×2.5″ tires.** Shave ≈1.5 mm from Xiaomi rims (lathe preferred), deburr carefully, and swap to curved valves so Monorim forks clear the stem—run 60–65 psi for 90 kg riders and treat wet pavement with caution. Builders chasing 10×3 conversions on the Pro 2 received the same advice along with reminders to upgrade controller MOSFETs/caps before pairing wider rubber with 48 V tunes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L60009-L60033】[^lathe]
- **Verify valve orientation and bushing stacks.** PMT 10×3 or CST 10×2 tubes can bind or leak if stems point the wrong way or bushings sit unevenly—check orientation before closing the fork, especially on dual 60H/50H hubs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L85-L85】
- **Protect Monorim hub screws.** When swapping to pneumatics, support the wheel and ease out the five perimeter screws—stripping one ruins the hub. Drill for 90° valves, shield magnets from filings, and rotate the stem ~45° if it still touches the fork.[^monorim-valve]
- **Keep water out after valve tweaks.** After rotating or bending stems for clearance, reinforce the grommet area so spray can’t wick into the motor cavity during rain rides.[^water-guard]
- **Pair 500 W Monorim hubs with quality air tires.** The workshop cautioned that the 500 W kit feels unsafe on stock rubber—install a modded air tire before feeding it 12 S power so traction matches the torque jump.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L20004-L20007】
- **Plan frame swaps around rim spacing.** Builders eyeing dual 72 V projects are already stockpiling stiffer Chinese frames, DT2 EX donor shells, and Vsett or Blade swingarms once they secure matching forks and brake adapters for the wider axles.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L501-L503】
- **Respect stem limits before chasing 16 S dual motors.** Veterans warn that stock M365 stems snap when you push dual drives without full chassis reinforcement, dual brakes, suspension, and deck plates—costs that rival a Vsett 9/9+ with safer geometry.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L536-L537】
- **Budget pack volume realistically.** You can squeeze 13 S 6 P into the deck if the controller moves outside, but AWD conversions usually need backpack or rack batteries plus AWG6 cabling, eroding Xiaomi’s portability advantage.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L538-L538】
- **Consider Ninebot frames for big builds.** Builders chasing stealth still love the Xiaomi Pro, yet Ninebot G30 chassis package dual VESCs and large packs more gracefully once stealth is less critical.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L539-L539】
- **Source race-proven tubeless hardware.** Rage Mechanics and RFP rims lock beads under race abuse—document part numbers plus the matching Amass 8 mm connectors so others can replicate the setup without guessing at components.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part007_review.md†L539-L539】
- **Respect 17 S upgrade limits.** A 17 S6 P Samsung 40T build demanded dual XT150 phase connectors, meticulous insulation, and tolerance for ~20 V droop through an undersized Daly BMS—plan thicker leads, fresh brakes, and be aware regen on over-voltage packs can spike controllers until the hardware is upgraded.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L21680-L21840】
- **Charging workarounds matter.** Riders lived with 16 S chargers dialled to ~67 V until programmable supplies arrived, watching pack balance closely because Daly boards refuse to equalise below ~4.18 V per cell on these over-voltage Xiaomi builds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L21780-L21868】

## Brake Packages
- Keep front mechanical or hydraulic brakes dialled even on regen-heavy builds, and back axle nuts with blue Loctite plus lock washers instead of guessing torque on soft aluminum dropouts.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L133-L133】
- **Semi-metallic pads:** Gold-toned semi-metallic pads last longer and maintain bite in rain compared with organic pads bundled with XTech calipers; ceramics run hotter and demand rotor monitoring.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L226-L227】
- **Rotor sizing:** Community swaps standardize on 135–140 mm rotors for Pro decks and 120 mm for base models when installing X-Tech HB100s or higher-end hydraulics.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L338-L338】
- **Rear-disc conversions:** Konyk 40 mm magnet hubs clear Xiaomi dropouts with 120 mm spacing and accept 180 mm rotors once spacers are machined—capture final washer stacks and torque specs when documenting conversions.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L20636-L20643】
- **Controller mounting templates:** Community drills for hanging a Ubox 75 V 100 A under the deck rely on threaded inserts plus separate buck converters for 5 V tail lights—document hole spacing and enclosure choices before copying the layout.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L20935-L20956】
- **Budget alternatives:** Properly adjusted MTB-style mechanical calipers (“Bike Attitude”) can outperform misaligned semi-hydraulics when combined with 135 mm rotors—center the fixed pad before tightening mounts.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L226-L227】
- **SNSC drum adapters:** Inverted SNSC setups need a spacer and both mounting points engaged before the drum aligns—plan fabrication time instead of relying on a single bracket.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L241-L241】
- **Kotto 3 mm motorcycle calipers:** Expect to machine spacers and bleed them immediately—the bite is excellent but the calipers ship thick and dry compared with scooter hydraulics.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L221-L221】
- **Support brake housing runs.** Tie the cable housing to the frame and trim excess length—loose housing eats lever travel and ruins braking force no matter the caliper upgrade.【F:knowledge/notes/denis_all_part02_review.md†L89091-L89096】
- **Watch Magura clearance.** MT7/MT8 calipers squeezed onto Xiaomi G30 and VSETT frames can lose their <5 mm tire gap as the casing flexes—check clearance regularly, keep spare banjos/hardware, and reconsider external hose reroutes that rub 10×3 tires after flats.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L642-L644】
- **Torque lever bleeds properly.** Magura lever bleed screws only want 0.5 Nm; overtightening strips the threads and dumps pressure mid-ride.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L683-L684】

## Suspension, Wheelbase & Handling Tweaks
- **Rear suspension stretch:** Bolt-on rear suspension kits extend wheelbase roughly 10 cm, noticeably calming Xiaomi chassis at 35–40 km/h once brake adapters are spaced correctly.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L226-L227】
- **Stem stability:** Pair plastic shims with Foldster X-Lock or Phoenix clamps to eliminate wobble; trim or relocate latch hardware so Wildman battery bags clear the hook without scuffing packs.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L272-L276】【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L399-L401】
- **Lighting integration:** 3D-printed fender supports and extender housings can host sealed LED strips or ESP32-controlled animations, but route wiring inside the bag to protect it from tire splash.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L276-L276】
- **Beam pattern validation:** Budget Towwoo “8000 lm” lights produced narrow hotspots compared with Olight/OSRAM lamps—photograph beam patterns after upgrades so Xiaomi riders can trust claimed lumen figures.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L23928-L23969】

## Setup Checklist
1. **Mock clearances:** Dry-fit the chosen tire and suspension combo, confirming mudguard, brake, and harness spacing before inflating to full pressure.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L337-L338】【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L369-L370】
2. **Bed brakes:** After any pad or rotor swap, bed the system in with controlled stops to prevent glazing and squeal—especially important for semi-metallic upgrades.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L226-L227】
3. **Retorque hardware:** Recheck axle nuts, adapter bolts, and suspension pivots after the first rides; stretched wheelbases and taller tires settle hardware quickly.【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L226-L227】【F:knowledge/notes/all_part01_review.md†L336-L337】
