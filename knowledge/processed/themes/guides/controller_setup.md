# Controller Setup and Tuning

## Baseline Build Profiles

- Dual 1 000 W motors paired with a 15 S 8 P battery and 40 A BMS deliver a proven commuting setup, with some builders planning 13 S packs initially and leaving room to scale back up to 15 S.[^build_example]

## Control Modes and Current Limits

- Riders switching from sine-wave controllers to full field-oriented control report higher top speeds and cooler motors on the same battery settings, noting that Xiaomi M365 conversions only held 90 A after reinforcing their hardware.[^foc_advantages]
- Square-wave aftermarket controller kits remain tempting at ~€80 for a dual pack with dash, but they hammer 150–200 A phase at launch, ride harsher for new users, and run noisier than VESC-based FOC setups despite the simple wiring.[^1]
- Sustained cut-outs under load may point to BMS current limits: scooters that pass bench tests but trip under rider weight likely need higher-capacity packs or relaxed protection thresholds.[^bms_cutout]
- Logs from 12 S setups show ~45 km/h at 32.5 A; raising voltage to 15 S and reducing current is recommended for better efficiency and lower heat.[^voltage_swap]

## Current Relationships & Cruise Options

- Artem’s relationship `I_phase = I_batt × V_batt ÷ V_motor` explains why phase torque fades as ERPM rises; expect battery current to climb from ~16 A at launch toward the configured limit as motor voltage increases, and keep phase current above battery current for predictable torque.[^phase_relationship]
- VESC Tool still lacks native cruise control, but Spintend’s handheld remote consolidates throttle, brake, horn, and light lines while offering button-activated cruise and reducing deck wiring; open-source SmartDisplay firmware may add a speed-lock profile later.[^spintend_cruise]

## Practical Current Heuristics

- Start hub tunes with Artem’s sizing math: phase amps roughly equal to motor wattage ÷ 10 and battery amps ≈ phase × 0.67; if you raise phase current for stronger launches, trim battery current by the same proportion so small stators stay inside their thermal envelope.[^2]
- Track controller and stator telemetry together.
  - Koxx’s logs showed phase current clipping once battery limits were reached around 25–30 km/h and that hard regen pulses add ≈5 °C to the stator, highlighting why current math and temperature logging must be reviewed together after every tune change.[^3]
- Treat field-weakening as a high-speed tool only; riders are still seeing 20–40 km/h gains but warn that the extra current draw demands tight temperature monitoring and duty-cycle triggers so launch torque and controller temps stay manageable.[^4]
- Dual Spintend crews treat 120–130 A phase per motor (≈160 A ABS max) as the realistic ceiling; if a hub “stutters” above ~85 A, assume a blown MOSFET or loose phase and inspect wiring or rerun sensorless detection before simply lowering limits.[^5]

## Thermal Management & Regen Safety

- Flipsky’s compact single begins brushing 60 °C on the MOSFETs within 3 km at 50 A battery / 85 A phase, pushing owners to improve heatsink pressure, refresh thermal paste, and add 40 mm fans before experimenting with 100–120 A tunes.[^6]
- Keep battery-side regen at or below the pack’s amp-hour rating (e.g., ≤10 A on a 10 Ah block) and set controller regen roughly 15 A higher so excess energy bleeds off as heat instead of spiking the cells or BMS.[^7]
- Manual hall detection on warm motors at ≈70 A finally cleared Mirono’s off-the-line clonk; rerun both motor wizards on a full battery and road-test immediately after detection so sensor faults surface before a commute.[^8]
- When sensorless detection misbehaves, unplug the hall loom and rerun the test.
  - Wheelway and Spintend owners found that leaving halls connected during “sensorless” detection corrupted profiles until they re-detected with the harness removed.[^9]
- If Spintend’s external ADC module feeds nonsense values, temporarily bypass it by wiring 3.3 V, signal, and ground straight from the VESC to the throttle or brake; just avoid slamming 5 V accessories onto the 3.3 V rail to protect the board.[^10]

## Example Tuning Profiles

- A Zero 10X dialled to 100 A rear / 60 A front phase with 80 A/50 A battery caps provides smooth launches and strong mid-speed pull without overheating.[^zero10x]
- Stock VSETT controllers taper output around 52 V (~10 % state of charge), effectively reducing battery current to protect aging cells.
  - behaviour the community wants to replicate in VESC firmware for builds lacking smart BMS data.[^vsett_taper]
- Kelly KLS scooter controllers often refuse USB connections.
  - plan on the BLE module or legacy Windows XP drivers when you need to flash or configure those platforms.[^11]

## Acceleration Logging & Telemetry

- Benchmark 0–70 km/h runs with Dragy or Race Timer, filming calibrated dashboards at 60 fps and averaging matched-direction passes to cancel GPS lag; Drag Racer remains convenient but needs clear skies to hold lock.[^accel_logging]
- Align controller telemetry with GPS by setting accurate pole counts and measuring wheel diameter under rider load so VESC speed stays slightly above GPS.
  - a useful safety margin for legal compliance checks.[^speed_alignment]
- Use phase-current logging as a health check: veterans start commuter hubs around 90 A phase / 30 A battery and scale toward 120 A phase if cooling allows, noting that excessive phase amps raise EMI/noise stress on Ubox logic stages.[^phase_baseline]
