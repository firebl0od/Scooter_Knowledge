# Xiaomi Fold & Pole Repair Notes

## Diagnosing Loose Poles

- A wandering folding-pin usually means the factory epoxy let go.
  - inspect the pole-to-stem joint and the pin carrier instead of overtightening the latch, which only chews the aluminum.[^1]
- Xiaomi rarely sells complete pole assemblies, so be ready to source aftermarket hardware or rebuild the existing tube with metal-filled epoxy and stainless clamps.[^2]

## Repair Workflow

- Strip the pole, clean away the failed adhesive, and reset the insert with high-strength epoxy (two-part metal formulas held up best in field repairs). Allow full cure before reinstalling the latch to keep play from returning on the first ride.[^2]
- When dealing with factory epoxy-bonded clamps, warm the joint gently with a heat gun, wick in IPA to soften the bond, and use wooden wedges to separate the halves so you avoid gouging aluminum before pressing hardware back together.[^3]
- If you cannot source OEM parts, reinforce the joint with inner and outer collars plus stainless hardware; riders have 3D-printed mockups before handing the design to local metal shops for permanent braces.[^4]

## Accessory Considerations

- The Max G30 accessory port shares traces with the rear light.
  - when it shows 5 V but no current, trace continuity back to the buck converter before blaming the port itself.[^5]
- After reassembly, reapply waterproofing around the latch slot and wiring pass-throughs; uncured epoxy and missing silicone gaskets let spray back into the stem and undo the repair.[^2]
