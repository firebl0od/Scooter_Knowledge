# Xiaomi Fold & Pole Repair Notes

## Diagnosing Loose Poles
- A wandering folding-pin usually means the factory epoxy let go—inspect the pole-to-stem joint and the pin carrier instead of overtightening the latch, which only chews the aluminum.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L110020-L110036】
- Xiaomi rarely sells complete pole assemblies, so be ready to source aftermarket hardware or rebuild the existing tube with metal-filled epoxy and stainless clamps.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L110030-L110036】

## Repair Workflow
- Strip the pole, clean away the failed adhesive, and reset the insert with high-strength epoxy (two-part metal formulas held up best in field repairs). Allow full cure before reinstalling the latch to keep play from returning on the first ride.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L110030-L110036】
- When dealing with factory epoxy-bonded clamps, warm the joint gently with a heat gun, wick in IPA to soften the bond, and use wooden wedges to separate the halves so you avoid gouging aluminum before pressing hardware back together.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L512-L512】
- If you cannot source OEM parts, reinforce the joint with inner and outer collars plus stainless hardware; riders have 3D-printed mockups before handing the design to local metal shops for permanent braces.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L110045-L110099】

## Accessory Considerations
- The Max G30 accessory port shares traces with the rear light—when it shows 5 V but no current, trace continuity back to the buck converter before blaming the port itself.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L110038-L110041】
- After reassembly, reapply waterproofing around the latch slot and wiring pass-throughs; uncured epoxy and missing silicone gaskets let spray back into the stem and undo the repair.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L110030-L110036】
