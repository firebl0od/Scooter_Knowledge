# SmartDisplay Integration & Operations Guide

## TL;DR

- SmartDisplay now ships with modular harnesses that bridge VESC Tool, Minimotors, Kelly, Zero, and VSETT controllers while logging GPS, RTC, and media controls, so plan UART + CAN runs even if you start with legacy hardware.[^1]
- Current production firmware bundles Kelly KLS profiles and police-mode button combos, with Sabvoton and BAC support queued once hardware output stabilises; OTA updates arrive over HTTPS with encrypted images to deter cloning.[^2]
- SmartDisplay pairs with VESC and legacy controllers over UART today and will gain native CAN + VESC Express support on the incoming hardware spin, so budget both 5‚ÄØV logic power and CAN high/low when future-proofing harnesses.[^1]
- The latest CNC aluminium housing ships with anti-glare glass, RTC, navigation, music controls, and dual buttons that already support single/double-click mapping; encoder knobs are planned for the production wave later this year.[^cnc-case]
- Treat the display as the hub for lighting, telemetry, and speed-mode governance: its OTA chain flashes every connected accessory board (5‚ÄØV/12‚ÄØV light drivers, button pods) alongside the head unit, simplifying updates if the CAN bus is wired correctly.[^2]
- Never tether SmartDisplay‚Äôs USB port to a computer while the controller is live; a single ground loop already blew the 3.3‚ÄØV rail and STM32 on a Ubox, forcing an RMA.[^3]
- Enable the ‚Äútransparent‚Äù BLE bridge when controllers lack onboard Bluetooth.
  - the SmartDisplay can proxy VESC Tool traffic like a USB dongle, but veterans still default to wired sessions if nearby trackers or radios inject interference.[^15]

## Hardware Snapshot & Compatibility Matrix

| Revision | Host Link | Required Leads | Notable Peripherals |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2022‚Äìmid‚ÄØ2024 batches | UART (RX/TX/GND/5‚ÄØV) | 4-wire JST or soldered pigtail | External button harness, optional light board |
| Upcoming hardware (2024Q4 roadmap) | CAN + UART bridge | CANH/CANL, 12‚ÄØV lighting feed, 5‚ÄØV aux | Native VESC Express slot, ESP32‚ÄëC3 module, CAN daisy-chain[^1] |
| Maker batches (2024) | UART + BLE pass-through | 4-wire JST, optional USB-C | Dash or deck module, transparent BLE bridge, SmartController companion board[^15][^18] |

- Early adopters validated SmartDisplay on dual Kelly, VESC, and Minimotors controllers; firmware exposes ‚âà95‚ÄØ% of editable parameters on-device and defers long strings (Wi‚ÄëFi SSID) to the mobile apps.[^4]
- The Voyage/TJA1051 CAN transceiver is the go-to spare for Voyage/SmartDisplay repair benches; stock a few for field swaps.[^5]
- Rage Mechanics‚Äô latest C350 controller kits now bundle SmartDisplay, thicker IMS plates, and ESP32-based BLE/IMU telemetry with an onboard 12‚ÄØV 3‚ÄØA rail.
  - harnesses remain DIY extras for now, so budget fabrication time.[^3]
- Builders priced a ‚Ç¨17 ESP32 touch display that ships with ready-to-flash Arduino code, letting teams print a housing and add Wi‚ÄëFi/Bluetooth telemetry without buying premium dashboards; community members even offer remote flashing help and printable cases for the ‚Ç¨20 Turkish variant if you need a turnkey budget dash.[^4][^5][^6][^7]

## Companion Boards & OEM Dash Retention

- **QS-S4 stealth swaps.** Vsett‚Äôs QS-S4 display and RFID pod speak UART like Zero dashboards, letting SmartDisplay integrations reuse the factory harness for stealth compliance checks once you dig the loom out of the foam and silicone potting.[^8]
- **SmartController dev board.** Koxx‚Äôs ‚Ç¨60 SmartController motherboard + shield keeps the OEM display for riders comfortable with coding and SMD work; the open-source build currently drives a single VESC with dual-motor support reserved for the paid ‚Äúpro‚Äù release.[^9]
- **Button and harness expectations.** The SmartController expects momentary buttons and custom cabling, so builders plan to reuse dual-button pods while letting the board orchestrate speed-mode UART commands across both controllers to keep rear hubs from overheating.[^10]
- **Nami LCD file access.** üá™üá∏AYO#74 is privately sharing the Nami LCD STL set while ‚ú®üá™üá∏ÿπŸÖÿ± compiles an 84‚ÄØV firmware build; a ‚Ç¨2 CH340 USB‚ÄìTTL dongle lets riders flash Eye‚ÄØ3/Eye‚ÄØ4 displays for VESC use without paying the ‚Ç¨80 PAS removal fee.[^11]

## Wiring & Installation Checklist

1. **Bench-Test Power Rails.** Confirm 5‚ÄØV and 3.3‚ÄØV logic rails on the controller before introducing SmartDisplay to avoid misdiagnosing brownouts.[^6]
2. **Match TF/TS100 harness colours.** The unlabeled ‚Äúgeneric JP‚Äù dash mirrors TF/TS100 button wiring.
  - colour-match its loom to the controller and leave RX/TX/GND/5‚ÄØV accessible because the current hardware still speaks UART until the CAN/Express revision ships.[^jp-generic]
3. **Route Lighting Bus.** The companion light board feeds both 5‚ÄØV and 12‚ÄØV lighting branches and reports controller faults back through SmartDisplay, so land CAN and the accessory power leads in the same session.[^2]
3. **Budget CAN power for add-ons.** The SmartRepair harness can back-feed 5‚ÄØV lighting from the CAN header.
  - drop an inline resistor and remember the servo header‚Äôs PWM pads if you want blinkers instead of always-on lamps.[^can-backfeed]
3. **Program OTA Chain.** Firmware updates publish to a web server; once the display flashes over Wi‚ÄëFi, it cascades the new build to every detected expansion board via CAN.[^2][^7]
4. **Choose controller roles intentionally.** Race teams sometimes assign the rear controller as the slave so SmartDisplay keeps the features they want (traction control, telemetry overlays) while the front stays the master.
  - validate the pairing before track days.[^12]
4. **Map Hotkeys & External Buttons.** Internal buttons can act as hotkeys, but external latching or momentary switches are supported for mode toggles and lighting; riders often park lighting on the auxiliary harness instead of the face buttons.[^7]
5. **Speed Modes via ADC2.** Tie ADC2 ‚Äúeco‚Äù limits to SmartDisplay‚Äôs virtual throttle ceilings when mixing with ADC-based throttles.
  - the display writes percentage caps that VESC enforces as duty/phase ceilings.[^7]
6. **Log UART throttle packets before rewiring.** SmartDisplay streams CRC-protected commands over UART, so capture the live data to confirm dips originate upstream before blaming harness noise or shielding.[^uart-crc]
7. **Finish the enclosure.** The shared 3.5‚ÄØin STL pack suits SLS/SLA printing, and builders now sand, paint, or resin-coat the housing to prevent translucent shells from yellowing under UV before bolting stem-cap mounts in place.[^16]

- **Grab the right dashboard firmware.** Xiaomi M365 owners running VESC‚ÄØ6.05 hardware rely on the `6_05_adc` community branch to fix braking/current bugs.
  - GitHub mirrors can lag a few minutes, so re-download if the patch fails on first flash.[^13]
4. **Program OTA Chain.** Firmware updates publish to a web server; once the display flashes over Wi‚ÄëFi, it cascades the new build to every detected expansion board via CAN.[^2][^7]
5. **Choose controller roles intentionally.** Race teams sometimes assign the rear controller as the slave so SmartDisplay keeps the features they want (traction control, telemetry overlays) while the front stays the master.
  - validate the pairing before track days.[^14]
5. **Map Hotkeys & External Buttons.** Internal buttons can act as hotkeys, but external latching or momentary switches are supported for mode toggles and lighting; riders often park lighting on the auxiliary harness instead of the face buttons.[^7]
6. **Speed Modes via ADC2.** Tie ADC2 ‚Äúeco‚Äù limits to SmartDisplay‚Äôs virtual throttle ceilings when mixing with ADC-based throttles.
  - the display writes percentage caps that VESC enforces as duty/phase ceilings.[^7]
7. **Log UART throttle packets before rewiring.** SmartDisplay streams CRC-protected commands over UART, so capture the live data to confirm dips originate upstream before blaming harness noise or shielding.[^uart-crc]
8. **Finish the enclosure.** The shared 3.5‚ÄØin STL pack suits SLS/SLA printing, and builders now sand, paint, or resin-coat the housing to prevent translucent shells from yellowing under UV before bolting stem-cap mounts in place.[^16]
9. **Clamp CAN displays cleanly.** Pandalgns released a three-part STL kit that wraps SmartDisplay-style housings around 30‚Äì32‚ÄØmm handlebars and includes printable straps to lock the pod in place for polished CAN dash installs.[^15]

## Feature Set & Navigation

- **Integrated GPS + Nav Prompts.** The 3.5‚ÄØin unit houses turn-by-turn guidance to keep phones off the bars; builders cite 10‚ÄØ√ó‚ÄØ6.5‚ÄØcm packaging as a sweet spot for 100‚ÄØkm/h scooters.[^8]
- **Waze Overlay.** Beta firmware already overlays Waze police alerts directly on the dashboard, foreshadowing richer third-party integrations once CAN message catalogs stabilize.[^9]
- **Active dev logs map the roadmap.** Weekly SmartDisplay diaries document layout experiments, overlay prototypes, and the Waze alert workflow so installers can reproduce CAN dashboards without waiting on formal docs.[^16][^17]
- **Production gearing up.** Koxx shared assembly photos and UI previews while Rage Mechanics prepared commercial support, signalling that plug-in TFT units with temperature alarms and custom icon packs are nearly ready for wider release.[^18][^19]
- **Theme editor & live switching.** Rage Mechanics now ships a web-based theme designer that can push new skins over Wi‚ÄëFi and swap layouts in real time on the scooter, making it easier to brand race fleets or share telemetry presets.[^20]
- **Telemetry Dashboards.** Race teams log throttle position, per-motor phase amps, traction-control response, and segment comparisons from SmartDisplay sessions.
  - handy for coaching and driver swaps.[^10]
- **Sunton ESP32-8048S043 builds.** Denis Shelema‚Äôs DIY Sunton dash brings a 4.3‚Ä≥ 800√ó480 capacitive touchscreen with GPS logging, configurable gauges, Wi‚ÄëFi firmware updates, handlebar button inputs, and onboard storage for odometer/settings once you finish the custom firmware and enclosure work.[^21][^22]
- **Fast boot sequence.** Unlike Raspberry‚ÄØPi-based dashboards that slog through a 45‚Äì95‚ÄØs OS boot, SmartDisplay‚Äôs MCU firmware brings up telemetry in about 10‚ÄØs once CAN current initializes.[^boot]
- **Lighting + Error Telemetry.** Kelly and VESC users receive controller error feedback (screenshots, codes) on SmartDisplay, easing remote debugging.[^2]
- **Wearable fallback.** Riders who skip a dash lean on the XMatic VESC Apple Watch app when they want telemetry without mounting extra hardware.[^23]

## Firmware & Profile Management

- SmartDisplay ‚Äúprofiles‚Äù live inside the phone app.
  - switching Eco/Sport rewrites live controller configs, so riders keep UART bridges (e.g., basti30‚Äôs Arduino tool) handy when they want on-scooter buttons that push alternate maps without cycling power.[^profile_bridge]
- The single-channel Spintend ships without Bluetooth; SmartDisplay‚Äôs pass-through mode or an external module keeps VESC Tool access alive while the rugged one-wire bus handles remote IO where I¬≤C runs fall over past ~15‚ÄØcm.[^single_bt]

- Production retail is targeting **‚Ç¨400‚Äì‚Ç¨600** with a ‚Ç¨199.99 early-adopter slot for the first ten units; budget above ‚Ç¨300 until volume ramps even though beta testers paid ‚Ç¨300.[^24]
- Rage Mechanics has logged 4,000+ development hours and keeps firmware closed-source while supporting Minimotors, VESC, Zero, VSETT, Kelly, and Kunteng buses.
  - explaining the ~‚Ç¨500 price point despite open-hardware roots.[^25]
- Beta batches sold at **300‚ÄØ‚Ç¨** for 15 testers with August assembly runs; production pricing remains under review.[^11]
- Rage Mechanics currently bundles SmartDisplay with its dual-controller kits (~489‚ÄØ‚Ç¨), and standalone sales are pending cost-down work‚Äîplan purchases early if you need just the dash.[^12]
- Expect retail pricing closer to ‚Ç¨500 once the premium feature set (CAN/UART breakout, telemetry, OTA, GPS, lighting control) is factored in.
  - Face de Pin Suc√©‚Äôs rundown helps set expectations for new buyers.[^26]
- Riders chasing budget instrumentation still repurpose RTV VESC-only displays or even spare phones when SmartDisplay pricing overshoots a project‚Äôs scope.[^27]
- Competing IPS dashboards (e.g., Voyage Megan) target 300‚Äì400‚ÄØ‚Ç¨ but lack SmartDisplay‚Äôs lighting bus, telemetry depth, and OTA ecosystem, so many riders still default to SmartDisplay.[^13]
- Low-volume CNC and SLS case work keeps retail expectations above ‚Ç¨300 until injection tooling arrives; the team is tooling distributors, planning a ~20-unit May build run with new central-mount housings, and baking ‚Äúpanic mode‚Äù legal presets alongside wider controller harness support.[^14]

## Telemetry Interpretation Notes

- SmartDisplay power numbers trend ~6‚Äì7‚ÄØkW below VESC RT Tool because it calculates from CAN-reported battery amps √ó voltage without VESC‚Äôs instantaneous filtering; align on one source before publishing specs.[^10]
- Bench telemetry already logged 332‚ÄØA / 21.4‚ÄØkW peaks from a 20‚ÄØS6‚ÄØP Molicel 40T pack with heavy sag (~55‚ÄØA per parallel), so capture per-parallel stress in your logs when validating high-power bursts.[^28]
- Phase-current overlays highlight traction-control activity (e.g., 189‚ÄØA front vs. 317‚ÄØA rear mid-corner) and help tune duty-cycle ramps after firmware changes.[^10]
- Voyage/Ambrosini dashboards also expose per-controller current when CAN aggregation hides which hub is fading.
  - lean on them or split CAN IDs so SmartDisplay users don‚Äôt misread combined ~500‚ÄØA phase logs as per-wheel data.[^29]

## Safety, Service & Troubleshooting

- **Dash-only scripts drop security features.** Rage Mechanics‚Äô ‚Äúdash-only‚Äù SmartDisplay firmware frees wiring but loses start-speed locks, button combos, and motor lockouts when the dashboard powers down.
  - recreate those safeties elsewhere before relying on the stripped harness.[^30]
- **Log firmware + failure modes.** Flipsky Smart Display users have already cooked ADC daughterboards and lost telemetry when firmware lags.
  - document the preferred firmware builds, the 12‚ÄØV‚Üí5‚ÄØV power-up order, and SimpleVescDisplay swap parts/STLs so riders can fall back to the ‚Ç¨10 ESP32 dash when OEM screens glitch.[^31][^32]
- **Cruise control stays manual.** The team refuses to spoof cruise via Lisp.
  - use the dedicated button on the remote or SmartDisplay‚Äôs onboard toggle rather than scripting ADC hacks that can run away.[^33]
- **USB Isolation.** Only flash or debug SmartDisplay over Wi‚ÄëFi/BLE when the controller is energized; USB-to-PC tests while the scooter is live can short grounds and nuke 3.3‚ÄØV logic.[^3]
- **CAN Health.** Expect ‚âà3.3‚ÄØV differential between CANH and CANL on a healthy bus; anomalous readings justify probing harness crimps before blaming firmware.[^6]
- **Spare Components.** Keep TJA1051 CAN ICs, JST pigtails, and spare ESP32 modules in the pit box to minimize downtime when a dash takes a spill.[^5]
- **Dual-motor presets.** Early ‚Äúpolice mode‚Äù experiments target CAN-synced loadouts that mute the front motor while leaving rear torque, so expect firmware drops that combine preset buttons with the BLE bridge once the prototypes stabilize.[^17]

## Roadmap & Ecosystem Outlook

- SmartDisplay‚Äôs apps push updates in minutes‚Äîdevelopers can add a new setting, publish OTA, and have riders flashing within five minutes over Wi‚ÄëFi.[^4]
- NetworkDir‚Äôs next hardware rev will speak native CAN, mimic Trampa‚Äôs SmartDisplay device registration, and bundle ESP32‚ÄëC3 Wi‚ÄëFi/BLE modules to host VESC Express dashboards without extra dongles.[^1]
- Rage Mechanics is weaving the display into turnkey race scooters, streaming telemetry to crews and elevating expectations for pro-grade HUDs in the VESC scene.[^12]
- Public release cadence targets late 2024/early 2025 with broader controller support, pricing between ‚Ç¨400 and ‚Ç¨600, and bundle options that include light boards and button pods.
  - set customer expectations accordingly.[^34]
- Firmware planning now includes encrypted OTA packages, Kelly/Sabvoton harness kits, and configurable ‚Äúpanic mode‚Äù speed caps so riders can stay compliant during roadside checks.[^14]
- Upcoming builds expand the existing 25/35/unlimited slots into user-tuned eco/normal/boost profiles that scale phase and battery current (e.g., eco at 0.6√ó/0.7√ó) and warn when MOSFET temps approach the boost gate.[^35]
- Production now spans dash-mounted screens and minimalist deck modules assembled by Koxx‚Äôs team, letting riders hide the BLE bridge in the deck when they prefer to keep phones on the bars for live telemetry.[^18]
