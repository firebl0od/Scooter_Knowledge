# DIY Battery Supply & Pack Architecture Playbook (2025)

## TL;DR
- Europe’s salvage stream of EVE 50PL cells pushes landed costs near 1 € per cell while U.S. buyers still face ~$9 retail, so teams are forming cross-border partnerships and stockpiling QS8 hardware ahead of tariff hikes.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L34-L38】
- High-power scooters are converging on 22–30 S frames with 8–11 P parallels: Dualtron Achilleus decks accept 22 S9 P packs once controllers move outboard, Nami race builds run 22 S11 P Molicel layouts toward 40 kW, and G30 conversions rely on upgraded skid plates and spacers to clear 20 S+ modules.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L37-L45】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L151-L160】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L168-L169】
- Smart BMS headroom still lags pack ambition: ANT discharge FETs can latch on failures and balance slowly, so builders pair structural pack supports (no hot glue) with redundant protection, UV inspections, and JBD/JK alternatives sized around 500 A continuous until 700 A units mature.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L99-L101】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L155-L156】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L172-L174】

## Cell & Component Sourcing Reference
- **Keep the high-power roster current.** Community testers just flagged EVE 40PL/50PL, Molicel P50B, and BAK 45D as the modern reference set for 300 A+ packs—refresh comparison sheets with Mooch’s latest lab data before committing to older chemistries.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L523-L524】
| Component | EU Pricing & Availability | North America Reality | Immediate Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **EVE 50PL 21700** | Salvaged Stark Varg modules deliver grade-A cells for ~1 € each after labor; retail bulk hovers 1.5 € with logos shaved yet still grade A.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L35-L36】 | ~$9 per cell retail with looming import duties.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L36-L38】 | Form cooperative buys, pre-clear customs brokers, and reserve storage for incoming pallets. |
| **Samsung/EVE 50E variants** | €1.5–2 each keep commuter packs affordable when 50PL supply tightens.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L155-L156】 | Similar pricing once landed but subject to tariff swings; easier sourcing than 50PL yet lower discharge ratings.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L155-L156】 | Stage these as fallback chemistries for ≤200 A builds; adjust wiring gauge accordingly. |
| **Molicel P45B / Samsung 40T** | Used in 22 S10/11 P race packs with 0.2 mm copper busbars and 350–500 A targets.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L37-L39】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L168-L169】 | Importable but pricier; rely on trusted builders when tooling costs outweigh one-off packs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L39-L39】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L156-L156】 | Schedule welding capacity, busbar stock, and thermal monitoring for >300 A continuous expectations. |
| **Samsung 48G (20 S 8 P reference)** | ≈150 A continuous before the pack or BMS becomes the bottleneck; plan upgrades when chasing >10 kW commuters.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L524-L524】 | Widely available but aimed at mid-power scooters; supplement with higher-rate parallels or cell swaps for race builds. | Treat 48G packs as interim solutions until you can weld P45B/P50B modules. |
| **QS8 connectors** | Stock through EU vendors today, but panel-mount options remain custom-fabricated.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L188-L188】 | Tariffs threaten to push unit cost toward $35; panel mounts rare.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L38-L38】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L188-L188】 | Bulk-order straight housings, print or machine mounts, and document safe connection sequences. |
| **Smart BMS (JBD/JK/ANT)** | JBD units land around €50 for 20 S packs; JK units offer higher balancing throughput but larger footprints.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L155-L155】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L174-L174】 | ANT advertises 470 A–1 050 A but has logged discharge latch failures; redundancy required.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L99-L101】 | Combine smart BMS with external fusing/contactors and publish reset workflows for stuck FETs. |
| **Spot welders (K-Weld, Glitter 811A)** | Proven 0.1 mm copper welds at ≈300 € including PSU; Glitter 811A needs periodic pin cleaning to restore 4.4 kA output.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L34-L34】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L152-L152】 | Cheaper 90 € claims lack field proof on copper; shipping heavy welders across the Atlantic adds cost.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L34-L34】 | Allocate budget for pro-grade welders or coordinate shared tooling with nearby builders. |

## Pack Architecture Patterns
- **Dualtron Achilleus conversions** – Deck cavity (~485 mm × 181 mm) supports 22 S9 P if controllers move to an external mount; stock decks hold 20 S7–8 P and ~100 A battery before needing relocation or compact ESCs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L37-L44】
- **Halo T107 Pro drawer rebuilds** – Packing a 22 S 10 P P45B block into the sliding tray leaves millimetres of clearance, so builders offset rows and wrap parallels to prevent abrasion while respecting the existing 420 A ANT ceiling or planning dual-BMS splits for 300–350 A targets.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L403-L405】
- **RM-Light race scooters** – 22 S 4 P tabless packs, RM-X 2024 rear motors, Beringer Br4ve brakes, and ≈37 kg curb weight give newcomers a blueprint for 130–140 km/h builds that stay lightweight by trading parallel count for premium components.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L205-L213】
- **Spanish Thunder 22 S 11 P builds** – Local teams are squeezing 100/75 A battery and 250/220 A phase out of P45B drawer packs on dual G300 controllers, hitting roughly 140 km/h when cooling and chassis geometry keep up.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L513-L514】
- **Nami “hotdog” racers** – 22 S11 P P45 builds pair 100 H rear / 70 H front motors, 500 A phase, 550 A absolute, and 100 % front FW to sync wheel speed, netting 146 km/h GPS with manageable 61 °C stator temps.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L168-L169】
- **Ninebot G30 MAX** – Builders drill and trim 3 mm ePowerFun skid plates for €25 stopgap protection, swap in custom spacers, and plan 20 S4 P-to-22 S layouts once rails are clear and pack supports printed.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L151-L151】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L118-L118】
- **30 S prototypes (Segway/Nami/G3)** – Ausias is CNC-ing supports for 22 S10 P Nami decks, while Finn’s G3 conversion fits 30 S3 P (15 S6 P) modules after bracket cuts; 30 S4 P remains too wide without welding and enclosure surgery.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L159-L160】

## Tooling, Fabrication & Thermal Management
- Budget welders rated for 0.15 mm copper rarely meet spec; proven setups rely on K-Weld or Glitter 811A plus rip-tests, nickel sandwiching, and calibrated power for 0.1 mm sheet.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L34-L34】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L152-L152】
- When welders refuse to fuse 0.2 mm copper cleanly, laminate two 0.1 mm copper–nickel sheets—Hackintoshhhh’s Glitter 801D build accepts the slight resistance penalty while keeping high-current busbars serviceable.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L345-L352】
- Keep skid plates functional: thermal paste is required before 3 mm aluminum plates materially sink heat, and fan kits need ducting rather than flush mounts to avoid recirculating hot air.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L119-L120】
- QS8/MT60 panel mounts are mostly custom; teams CAD their own plates to keep phase and battery leads from dangling while preserving access for service loops.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L188-L188】

## BMS & Protection Strategy
- ANT 470 A/1 050 A packs have latched discharge FETs after overnight charges; the community now treats ANT as requiring redundant contactors or manual disconnects and documents UV-inspection resets before declaring hardware dead.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L99-L101】
- ANT’s published 420 A ceiling leaves Halo-style 22 S 10 P race packs with limited headroom—either parallel two units or accept accelerated wear when chasing 300–350 A discharge goals.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L403-L405】
- Balance behavior differs: ANT bleeds every cell simultaneously but with limited current, whereas JK hardware addresses two series groups at once, making JK preferable for large parallels needing faster equalization.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L174-L174】
- Teverun Fighter 11+ modules that only wake with the charger attached typically have dead parallels; rebuild the whole 60 V 35 Ah pack or use carefully matched Samsung 50S replacements instead of spot-swapping a couple of cells.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part013.txt†L10636-L10669】
- Keep cost spreadsheets realistic: even DIY 20 S packs need €50 BMS units, €50–200 welders, insulation, and shipping cushions—budget builders increasingly hire trusted pack shops when customs make single builds uneconomical.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L155-L156】
- Charge-only BMS stopgaps (e.g., 20 S commuters on a 40 A ANT board) should be treated as temporary; one short across the discharge leads will still dump into the ESC, so plan inline fuses, inspections, or a full smart-BMS upgrade before daily use.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L307-L308】

## Structural & Safety Fundamentals
- Never rely on hot glue alone; use 3D-printed spacers or structural adhesives so weld strips don’t carry mechanical load during transport or crashes.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L172-L172】
- Step connector spec sheets from XT90 (≈110 A battery) toward dual XT90s or QS8 once Spintend-class controllers request higher battery amps; crews reserve QS8s for the first jump beyond single XT90 duty.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L401-L401】
- Match chemistries inside parallels: mixing pouch and cylindrical cells accelerates swelling even when copper busbars handle 350 A/450 A bursts, so spec unified cells or larger BMS hardware (≈230 A) before blending formats.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L39-L39】
- Schedule periodic UV/visual inspections for burned traces on smart BMS boards, especially after preload-failure alarms or unexplained current draw.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L100-L100】
- Recognise regional packaging habits: U.S. crews still prioritise seats and external battery crates, while European racers chase lighter standing decks—document enclosure choices early so comfort, legality, and aesthetics align with the rider’s market.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L201-L205】

## Build Checklist
1. **Lock in cell supply** – confirm volume, customs path, and aging tests for each batch of 50PL/50E/P45B cells before welding.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L35-L37】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L155-L156】
2. **Spec welding & busbars** – validate welder output on scrap strips, target 0.1–0.2 mm copper, and document Glitter/K-Weld maintenance steps for the build log.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L34-L34】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L152-L152】
3. **Mock the enclosure** – dry-fit spacers, skid plates, and controller mounts to prove 22 S9 P–30 S3 P geometries before live welding.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L37-L45】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L151-L160】
4. **Layer protection** – choose BMS hardware with known reset workflows, add external fuses/contactors, and rehearse ANT fault recovery with UV inspection gear.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L99-L101】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L174-L174】
5. **Secure the pack** – replace hot glue with interlocking supports, torque QS8/MT60 mounts, and apply thermal paste before final enclosure torque-down.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L119-L120】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L172-L172】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L188-L188】
