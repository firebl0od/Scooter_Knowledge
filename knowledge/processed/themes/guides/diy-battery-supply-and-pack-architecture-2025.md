# DIY Battery Supply & Pack Architecture Playbook (2025)

## TL;DR
- Europe’s salvage stream of EVE 50PL cells pushes landed costs near 1 € per cell while U.S. buyers still face ~$9 retail, so teams are forming cross-border partnerships and stockpiling QS8 hardware ahead of tariff hikes.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L34-L38】
- High-power scooters are converging on 22–30 S frames with 8–11 P parallels: Dualtron Achilleus decks accept 22 S9 P packs once controllers move outboard, Nami race builds run 22 S11 P Molicel layouts toward 40 kW, and G30 conversions rely on upgraded skid plates, spacers, and cardboard pack mockups before committing to 20 S12 P experiments.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L37-L45】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L151-L160】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L168-L169】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L402-L408】
- Production scooters rarely ship high-discharge cells outside of premium brands like Nami, so builders keep planning sleeper 20 S 3 P Molicel packs or full 20 S 9 P 21700 conversions even when the OEM battery is new.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L102-L102】
- Copper strip markets are volatile again—mid-2024 quotes doubled while riders debated 0.37 C “fast” charging, forcing TIG busbar budgets and group buys before multi-day endurance rides.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L16198-L16266】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L20698-L20700】
- Smart BMS headroom still lags pack ambition: ANT discharge FETs can latch on failures and balance slowly, so builders pair structural pack supports (no hot glue) with redundant protection, UV inspections, and JBD/JK alternatives sized around 500 A continuous until 700 A units mature.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L99-L101】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L155-L156】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L172-L174】
- Voltage raises demand more than it saves: stepping commuter builds from 16 S to 20 S trims battery current and nets roughly 2.5 km/h per added series cell, but 100 V MOSFETs run ~33 % higher Rds(on) and the longer pack demands tighter insulation, busbar clearance, and rider safety protocols before chasing the headline speed.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L601-L602】
- NKON buyers chasing ≈100 A battery peaks still favour Molicel 40T cells despite cost, treating LG M50LT as a budget fallback until high-current tests confirm it avoids the 15 V sag seen on older 50G packs; budget ebike builds meanwhile stick with LG MH1 at about €1.70 per cell until 21700 options are affordable again.[^nkon-40t]
- Kaabo’s stock 16 S5 P pack still surges to 150–155 A despite 60 A controller limits, dropping ~15 V under dual-Ubox launches—most riders plan chemistry upgrades (P42A/P45B or Samsung 50S) and connector changes before trusting the platform at sustained 120 A battery draw.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part002.txt†L8972-L8985】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part002.txt†L8992-L9016】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part002.txt†L8830-L8854】
- Real sag logs put chemistry choices in context: a 20 S9 P Samsung 48X pack only dropped 6–7 V at 130–150 A with cell temps under 27 °C, while Paolo’s 21 S7 P Sony pack lost about 9 V at ~193 A—evidence that 14 A-class cells stay cool but 25 A-class sticks need active monitoring when pushed harder.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part002_review.md†L446-L465】
- Size parallels by expected watt-hours and load—not nominal Ah—with 6 P 21700 stacks roughly matching 7 P 18650 volume and VTC6 12 S strings rivaling 35E 13 S sag when currents stay under 7 A per cell.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L224-L225】
- Regional packaging philosophies diverge: U.S. commuters keep bolting on seats and external battery crates for comfort, while European race crews carve weight out of standing decks—log both approaches so new builders balance ergonomics, legality, and style goals before welding a pack around one camp.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L201-L201】
- AWD newcomers should stage upgrades: 12 S 3 P commuter packs brown out on VESC duals, so run a single motor until a 16 S 5–7 P pack (or paired internal/external strings) is ready, and treat 13 S 5 P builds as 50–75 A battery systems despite the 15 A-rated cells.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L309-L311】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L310-L311】

## Cell & Component Sourcing Reference
- **Keep the high-power roster current.** Community testers just flagged EVE 40PL/50PL, Molicel P50B, and BAK 45D as the modern reference set for 300 A+ packs—refresh comparison sheets with Mooch’s latest lab data before committing to older chemistries.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L523-L524】
- **Log per-cell sag realities.** LG MJ1 parallels started drooping once draws topped ~7–10 A per cell, whereas Samsung 35E banks held voltage better at the same load—document chemistry limits before promising 16 S commuters big torque numbers.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L121-L121】
- **Budget Xiaomi rebuilds still bottleneck at ~40 A per half-pack.** Dual 20 S stacks built from repacked Xiaomi cells only yield ~17.5 Ah and 40 A per section, so Zero 10X upgrades need parallel 8 AWG-equivalent harnesses at 100 A draws to avoid voltage sag.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L236-L236】
- **Expect regional sourcing hurdles.** Turkish builders blocked from NKON lean on LG 29E/50E substitutes despite their sag, while racers still crown Molicel P45B for holding voltage under high current—plan budgets and timelines around customs bottlenecks.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L344-L345】
- **Budget regional price swings.** Israeli builders are now paying roughly €47 for a pair of Samsung P42A cells and struggling to import Samsung 50S stock, so mentors steer them toward EVE 40P parallels that give up 1 Ah yet deliver nearly double the discharge headroom at similar landed cost.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part010.txt†L9039-L9093】
- **Keep the high-power roster current.** Community testers just flagged EVE 40PL/50PL, Molicel P50B, and BAK 45D as the modern reference set for 300 A+ packs—refresh comparison sheets with Mooch’s latest lab data before committing to older chemistries.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L523-L524】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part013.txt†L5661-L5666】
| Component | EU Pricing & Availability | North America Reality | Immediate Actions |

| **Samsung 48X 21700** | €3.35 per cell in 130-piece lots with excellent voltage matching (≤1 mV spread after 7 kW pulls).【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L25083-L25095】 | Limited availability; prized for low impedance and cycle life projections (~2 000 cycles at 30–95 % SoC).【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L25101-L25145】 | Reserve for high-power commuters needing long life; compare against Samsung 50G when prioritising low-amp cruising efficiency. |
| **Samsung 50G / 50S (direct import)** | Group buys land around €4.9–5.1 per cell (100 pc MOQ) with fresh offers dipping to €4.71 when teams coordinate outside marketplace fees; 50S handles 20 A fanless or 35 A with active cooling while 48X trails on heat.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L274-L274】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L151-L151】 | Expect €10 retail via EU resellers; still cheaper than piecemeal U.S. buys but budget shipping lead time.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L274-L274】 | Organise pallet orders, pre-pay VAT, and log discharge tests before promising 35 A service. |
| **LiitoKala LF105 / LF280 LiFePO₄** | Budget prismatic cells arrive unbalanced and sag above 12 A; sea freight stretches timelines but chemistry remains attractive for stationary packs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L317-L317】 | Heavy freight and low C-rate limits make them poor scooter candidates without huge enclosures.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L317-L317】 | Reserve for off-board storage or energy carts; budget active balancing before parallel use. |
| **Molicel P45B / Samsung 40T** | Used in 22 S10/11 P race packs with 0.2 mm copper busbars and 350–500 A targets.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L37-L39】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L168-L169】 | Importable but pricier; marketing touts 45 A discharge and 6 A charge, yet builders still favour Samsung 30T/40T or P42A until independent 20–40 A curves prove the gains.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L39-L39】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L156-L156】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L9085-L9299】 | Schedule welding capacity, busbar stock, and thermal monitoring for >300 A continuous expectations. |
| **Molicel P45B / Samsung 40T** | Used in 22 S10/11 P race packs with 0.2 mm copper busbars and 350–500 A targets.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L37-L39】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L168-L169】 | Importable but pricier; rely on trusted builders when tooling costs outweigh one-off packs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L39-L39】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L156-L156】 | Schedule welding capacity, busbar stock, and thermal monitoring for >300 A continuous expectations. |
| **LG M50LT (21700)** | Considered a budget alternative to 40T for ≈100 A packs, pending confirmation it avoids the voltage sag seen on older LG 50G builds.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part002_review.md†L145-L146】 | Limited test data; treat as provisional until high-current characterization is logged.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part002_review.md†L145-L146】 | Stage lab discharges before deploying in high-demand packs; weigh P42A/P45B thermal headroom against Samsung 50S cost before locking chemistry.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part002.txt†L8992-L9016】 |
| **LG MH1 (18650)** | Still popular in lightweight commuter packs at ≈€1.70 per cell despite limited current capability.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part002_review.md†L146-L147】 | Similar pricing in other regions; best suited for modest current demands until 21700 budgets recover.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part002_review.md†L146-L147】 | Use for low-amp builds and plan future upgrades to higher-discharge chemistries. |
| **Samsung 48X** | Veterans still praise 48X for moderate 12 A-per-cell builds, reporting ≤30 °C pack temps and excellent balancing with active shuttling.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part002_review.md†L170-L172】 | Scarcer in North America; import when you prioritise longevity over sheer discharge capability.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part002_review.md†L170-L172】 | Pair with active balancers to exploit the chemistry’s tight cell spread. |
| **EVE 40P (21700)** | Authentic samples show 5–7 mΩ IR and cooler operation than P42A pulls | Pricing still volatile; confirm provenance before bulk buys | Favor for high-current builds when 40PL packaging is impractical.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L499-L500】 |
| **BAK 2600 mAh (18650)** | ~€0.50 per cell for Xiaomi conversions but ~40 mΩ IR keeps them commuter-only | Limited U.S. sourcing and marginal headroom for heavy riders | Cap around 20 A per cell or reserve for lightweight builds to avoid sag complaints.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L275-L275】 |
| **Aspilsan 18650 (2.9 Ah)** | Entering Zero 10X upgrades across Turkey; treated as 5 C parts despite 25 A pulse claims | Import friction keeps pricing uncertain outside TR | Hold continuous draw near 15–20 A per cell until broader validation lands.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L278-L278】 |
| **EVE 40PL prisms** | ≈€6–7 each in small batches or ~$4.35 direct (50 pc MOQ + ~$100 freight) | Held 3.0 V for 62 s at 100 A while P45B sagged to 2.78 V after 44 s | Reserve wider housings and reinforce busbars before switching to pouch cells.[^21][^eve-pricing] |
| **Molicel P50B / XA3 previews** | P50B sampled at 5 Ah/65 A; XA3 teased at ≈50 A discharge with unknown cycle life | Potential step beyond P45B pending validation | Budget pilot batches and expect premium pricing until datasheets land.[^p50b][^xa3] |
| **LG M26 / MH1 budget stock** | €1 M26 cells remain common in high-tariff regions but show ≈14 mΩ IR when fresh versus >30 mΩ on older MH1 pulls | Adequate for commuter packs but sag versus premium cells; plan future upgrades | Builders debate tolerating sag temporarily or pausing builds until pricier cells are affordable, noting Aspilsan A28 samples breach 90 °C at 10–15 A while LG M26 stays near 40 °C on the same draw.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L357-L363】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L15885-L15938】 |
| **Tenpower 40TG** | Early four-parallel pulls held ≈65 A per cell with datasheet claims of 40 A continuous, hinting at promising race chemistry once thermal data is logged.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L19028-L19052】 | Limited field testing; expect pilot batches and temperature logging before deploying in commuter fleets. | Instrument packs heavily and validate heat rise before adopting for sustained 150 A scooters. |
| **QS8 connectors** | Stock through EU vendors today, but panel-mount options remain custom-fabricated.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L188-L188】 | Tariffs threaten to push unit cost toward $35; panel mounts rare.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L38-L38】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L188-L188】 | Bulk-order straight housings, print or machine mounts, and document safe connection sequences. |
- **SK 54 Ah pouch modules** | Advertised around 2 mΩ with 300 A continuous / 500 A peak output, but the tall bricks demand external battery bags or enlarged scooter housings to clear typical decks—treat packaging as the limiting factor, not the cell chemistry.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L435-L435】 |
| **Smart BMS (JBD/JK/ANT)** | JBD units land around €50 for 20 S packs; JK units offer higher balancing throughput but larger footprints.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L155-L155】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L174-L174】 | ANT advertises 470 A–1 050 A but has logged discharge latch failures; redundancy required.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L99-L101】 | Combine smart BMS with external fusing/contactors and publish reset workflows for stuck FETs. |
| **Spot welders (K-Weld, Glitter 811A)** | Proven 0.1 mm copper welds at ≈300 € including PSU; Glitter 811A needs periodic pin cleaning to restore 4.4 kA output.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L34-L34】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L152-L152】 | Cheaper 90 € claims lack field proof on copper; shipping heavy welders across the Atlantic adds cost.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L34-L34】 | Allocate budget for pro-grade welders, shorten KWeld 8 AWG leads, stack CNHL LiPos or car batteries for 1 600 A hits, and refresh lugs so cable losses don’t steal kilowatts from copper “sandwich” busbars.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part002.txt†L11188-L11209】 |

Alibaba-listed A123 20 Ah LiFePO₄ prismatics still tout 200 A charge capability, but builders treat the spec skeptically and warn that the bulky format complicates scooter packaging compared with cylindrical cells.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L437-L437】

- NetworkDir is already eyeing Molicel’s XA-series race cells (~2.6 Ah, ≈1.5–2 mΩ, 125 A charge/250 A discharge) while noting EVE 40PL still leads around 3 mΩ—use those benchmarks when planning 30 S drag packs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L132-L132】
- 🇪🇸AYO#74’s 22 S11 P LG M50LT pack now serves as a placeholder until a P45B rebuild unlocks ≈495 A, underscoring how race teams schedule chemistry upgrades around discharge goals.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L133-L133】
- Turkey’s new €30 import ceiling effectively blocks direct orders of scooters, motors, and welders; expect to pay 2–3× via licensed importers or coordinate in-country sourcing.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L147-L147】
- Even shipping bare frames faces scrutiny—airlines flag scooter parts over 100 Wh, so plan on slow, expensive ground freight for cross-border chassis trades.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L148-L148】

## Motor & Controller Procurement Signals
- **Cheap 60 H “20×3” hubs trade torque for price.** AliExpress listings confirmed to use only 20 parallel strands instead of the usual 22, noticeably cutting copper fill and off-the-line thrust—plan on rewinds or pay for higher-grade cores when you need real race torque.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L339-L344】
- **Document axle swaps step-by-step.** Arnau’s workflow removes the lock washer, drives the old axle out with a protected mallet, and re-centres LY hubs with thin washers because many rims ship offset toward the brake side—capture photos before pressing in new shafts.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L344-L350】
- **Shortlist 85 V-class controllers with accessories in mind.** Spintend’s 85150 remains the go-to replacement when riders outgrow Flipsky 75100 duals; Matthew’s lineup reminder covers the ADC3 accessory bridge and the 18 S dual variant so builds preserve brake lights, horns, and external switches without homebrew boards.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L348-L357】
- **Budget time for magnet topology differences.** Paolo notes Lonnyo’s budget 80 H cores stitch two 40 H magnets together, complicating smooth FOC versus single-piece 70/75/90 H stacks—log detection tweaks or spend more on monolithic magnet rings.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L357-L362】

## Pack Architecture Patterns
- **32 S3 P vs. 16 S6 P geometry** – Jan reminded builders that a 32 S 3 P stack fits the same 17×4 cell footprint as a 16 S 6 P module, so high-voltage prototypes can reuse proven deck layouts as long as insulation and enclosure clearances scale with the extra series count.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part011.txt†L19303-L19306】
- **18 S 9 P P45B commuter packs** – Pulling 350 A from nine parallels lands near 40 A per cell; mentors advised logging sag and delivered phase amps before redesigning the layout, then focusing on cooling and packaging rather than jumping to 20 S because higher voltage won’t ease per-cell stress and mainly raises top speed.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L521-L522】
- **20 S 5 P 65H race packs** – Custom 20 S 5 P layouts around 65H 17×4 motors land near 31.5 Ah (≈90 A battery) and force teams to decide between dual 16 S packs for 63 Ah range, a 20 S jump for speed, or a full 32 S leap depending on controller health (85150 vs. 85250).【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L122-L123】
- **Dualtron Achilleus conversions** – Deck cavity (~485 mm × 181 mm) supports 22 S9 P if controllers move to an external mount; stock decks hold 20 S7–8 P and ~100 A battery before needing relocation or compact ESCs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L37-L44】
- **Kaabo Wolf deck plans** – Owners sketch 20 S7 P footprints around 160 × 470 × 75 mm and weigh charge-only BMS wiring plus detachable JK balancers against flat ANT/JK smart boards that can actively balance ≈150 A builds inside the deck.[^kaabo-20s7p]
- **Deck spacer cautionary tales** – Oversized 3D-printed spacers claiming to fit four Xiaomi Pro packs rely on sparse M3 hardware and plastic trays to restrain ~30 kg of cells; veterans flag braking/suspension limits and insist on metal reinforcements before chasing that capacity.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part002.txt†L4757-L4799】
- **Layout planning tools** – RePackr and e4bike.ru configurators help visualise series/parallel counts but miss vertical stacking tricks; CAD mockups remain mandatory for triangle packs and tight decks.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part002.txt†L4813-L4857】
- **Hyosung “Puneron” gearing reference** – A 72 T/9 T sprocket set delivered the dirt-bike torque PuneDir was chasing on large-wheel conversions, giving builders a baseline ratio for similar hybrids.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L108-L108】
- **Jiabada 17 S BMS fit checks** – Copper-backed 17 S/50 A Jiabada smart boards ship in under a week and fit alongside 17 S6 P LG stacks inside Xiaomi Pro 2 decks (~119 mm internal width) once you grind the rails or extend the tray for 21700 cells plus clearance.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L231-L233】
- **SNSC rental-frame builds** – Crash-tested Segway SNSC tubes are handling 84 V packs at ~300 A continuous when paired with dual Spintend 85/250 controllers, cementing the platform as a premium donor once fleet frames surface.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L14765-L14807】
- **Deck booster modules** – External 20 S 4 P bricks riding in 5 L Newboler or Wildman bags must match the deck pack’s chemistry, IR, and capacity before paralleling—mismatched cells fight each other and cook balance leads on 20 S 8 P Ninebot builds.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L231-L232】
- **Teverun Supreme 20 S 7 P reality** – The stock 35 Ah pack can burst past datasheet limits but still sags around 100 A; commuters planning sustained power swaps are moving to P45B-class cells or custom packs sized for higher continuous output.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L320-L324】
- **High-voltage vs. high-current layouts** – Riders moving from 10 S 6 P to 20 S 3 P P45B packs log lower I²R losses and steadier torque because the controller can deliver 60–80 A phase while sipping ~40 A battery; the extra voltage headroom beats brute-force current for efficiency.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L296-L297】
- **Ninebot G30 rectangular packs first.** The stock frame hides 20S6P packs cleanly, but veterans warn that stretching to 20S9P by machining rails and relocating the ESC complicates busbar routing and weakens structure—keep first builds rectangular before chasing every spare millimetre.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L27-L27】
- **20 S7 P Xiaomi-class builds need risers.** Packing 140 cells into a stock deck requires roughly 40 mm extender plates, proving that large parallels demand structural add-ons rather than simply rearranging the OEM bay.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L436-L436】
- **Hybrid internal/external layouts demand precise planning.** A 3 L Wildman bag barely swallows 56 × 21700 cells, so stretch builds mock up nickel runs, split parallels (e.g., 12 P internal, 8 P external), and treat pack harnessing as the gating factor before punching slots in the deck.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L103-L103】
- **Samsung 40T rebuilds revitalise tired fleets.** Replacing saggy 29E packs with 20 S 10 P 40T arrays drops voltage sag by roughly 7 V—nearly a 10 % top-speed bump on voltage-limited scooters—while demanding controllers that can stomach the heavier current draw.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L141-L141】
- **Commuter e-bikes benefit from 20 S upgrades.** Swapping 13 S 6 P 35E bricks for 20 S 5 P high-discharge packs nets about 60 % more capacity with less sag, especially when riders stage spare modules to keep handling sharp.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L309-L309】
- **Navee N65/S65 headroom.** Expect room for dual VESCs and roughly 100 21700 cells with modest spacers, but cramming 120×18650 cells plus a 150 A JK BMS takes aggressive packaging and careful harness routing.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L85-L85】
- **40PL GT2 envelopes** – Rosheee’s 20 S 6 P Samsung 40PL core from @jamessoderstrom stays inside James’ conservative current caps yet has riders eyeing 26 S upgrades; he’s already ordering 0.3 mm copper busbars so the pack can stretch safely once the chassis is ready.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L324-L325】
- **Stealth 20 S9 P sleepers** – Jerome’s 20 S9 P EVE 40P commuter pack prioritises low internal resistance and cold-weather output even after peers praised Bak 45D; he shelved 40PL cells as overkill for the target scooter.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part010.txt†L18727-L18741】
- **30 S single-motor experiments** – Patrick’s 30 S ambitions lean on Samsung 40T because customs complicate EVE imports, and his Lonnyo 16×4 hub plan includes dual-end wiring so he can swap between star and delta when chasing 120 km/h goals.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part010.txt†L19893-L20028】
- **20 S12 P high-current commuters** – Haku’s 20 S12 P Molicel P42A pack regularly handles ~250 A battery and 300 A phase with a 520 A BMS cutoff, reinforcing that highway pulls demand large parallels to limit sag and overheating.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part010.txt†L19921-L19942】
- **Dualtron Achilleus conversions** – Deck cavity (~485 mm × 181 mm) supports 22 S9 P if controllers move to an external mount, and builders are now stretching Achilleus/DT3 shells for 21 S 11 P Molicel packs or 22 S 9 P P45B layouts paired with Spintend 85250 controllers—budget spacer stacks and dropout machining before chasing legal-looking, high-voltage drivetrains.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L37-L44】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L223-L223】
- **Halo T107 Pro drawer pack** – Pandalgns’ 22 S 10 P P45B rebuild barely clears the drawer extender; offset rows, compression wrap, and abrasion barriers are mandatory to stop cells rubbing as the sled flexes.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part013.txt†L17621-L17635】
- **Samsung 48G commuter baseline** – A Samsung 48G 20 S 8 P pack tops out around 150 A continuous before the BMS becomes the bottleneck; plan controller upgrades (e.g., dual Spintend 85/150) only after confirming the discharge spec and thermal headroom.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part013.txt†L6065-L6200】
- **Halo Knight T107 Pro blueprint** – Pandalgns is packaging dual MKS 84200HPs, HM 3000 W 60 H hubs, and a planned 22 S 10 P P45B pack with 12 AWG phases, offering a ready-made layout for similarly sized decks once cooling and capacitor headroom are logged.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L119-L119】
- **RM-Light race scooter baseline** – The RM-Light crew’s 22 S 4 P tabless packs, RM-X 2024 rear motors, and Beringer Br4ve brakes come in around 37 kg, giving builders a lightweight benchmark for 130–140 km/h race scooters built from premium components.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L204-L204】
- **Cooling above 300 A phase** – Omar’s dual Spintend NAMI build overheated hubs and the 20 S 10 P 50S pack at 200 A battery / 310 A phase, while AYÓ reminded riders the stock 40 Ah module’s LG M50LT cells are only good for ~116 A continuous (≤135 A peaks) until rebuilt—treat airflow, pack upgrades, or current caps as mandatory before chasing similar numbers.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L120-L121】
- **Stem-pack practicality** – Noname’s Vsett 11 runs a 16 S 6 P stem pack without upsetting chassis balance, but he cautions the same mass overwhelms Ninebot G30 frames—log stem-pack weight limits per chassis before copying the recipe.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L122-L122】
- **Reinforced Ninebot G2 conversions** – Face de Pin Sucé is machining adapters and a 1 cm steel skid plate to house a 20 S 5 P Samsung 40T pack plus Rage FH60 motor, highlighting the fabrication burden when chasing street-legal torque in lightweight frames.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L123-L123】
- **Hybrid Minimotors/VESC stacks** – Murcia’s “Pump” scooter ties two 16 S 200 A Molicel modules into a Minimotors controller and a VESC 75100 V1 for ≈20 kW mixed drivetrains—proof hybrids can work when charge paths and grounding are planned carefully.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L124-L124】
- **Turnkey single-motor benchmark** – Baartu is selling a €1.5 k package (20 S 5 P EVE 40P pack, LY 17×4 65 H hub, Ubox 85150, PMT tires, Monorim suspension) that claims 10.5 kW, 0–50 km/h in 2.2 s, and 85 km/h with field weakening—handy price/performance reference when quoting custom builds.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L145-L145】
- **22 S 10 P roadmaps** – Race builders still default to Molicel P45B for 22 S 10 P layouts but are already scouting 40–50 PL chemistries and Ampace JP40 cells for future 30–40 S experiments where higher voltage trims amp draw instead of chasing thicker busbars.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L269-L269】
- **Ninebot GT2 / Max G2 race builds** – Teams now pursue 26 S8 P P42A layouts feeding Tronic X12s; success hinges on clamping dual Ubox controllers to aluminum and retuning wheel diameter/kv for the higher voltage.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L312-L315】
- **Nami “hotdog” racers** – 22 S11 P P45 builds pair 100 H rear / 70 H front motors, 500 A phase, 550 A absolute, and 100 % front FW to sync wheel speed, netting 146 km/h GPS with manageable 61 °C stator temps.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L168-L169】
- **VSETT 10+ deck with external controllers** – Relocating controllers outside the deck makes room for a 20 S9 P Samsung 48X pack with ~2 mm side clearance in a 169 mm jig; builders pair it with JK active-balancing BMS boards, waterproof Higo/Julet harnesses, pre-welded copper-clad bus tabs (~$170 shipped), and QS8 anti-spark mains that tuck into copper-reinforced “W” busbars before the lid rises on PVC/acrylic spacers.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L6371-L6486】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L6501-L6504】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L8851-L8913】
- **Long-term upgrade debates** – Riders weighing 30 S6 P Max conversions and 65H hubs in 11″ frames found that minor swingarm milling plus shims make oversized stators feasible if battery and controller volume are planned early.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L161-L161】
- **Segway C80 retrofits** – Noname’s walkthrough fits a 32 P Samsung 35E pack by cutting the plastic trunk into four 6×10 cell layers, massaging corners, trimming the battery box, and notching the upper shock bracket just enough to keep the exterior plastics intact while using the ≈165 mm dropout that accepts threaded 10" hubs with drum brakes and sprocket mounts.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L288-L295】
- **Seated tourers need packaging discipline.** The same Segway-based moped now weighs ~350 lb before the rider; Noname would redo it as a lighter 32 S 20 P stack with a Seven controller to regain torque, illustrating how dense 32 P packs trade away maneuverability despite delivering ≈9.4 kWh and 70 mi of range.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L333-L336】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L312-L316】
- **Thunder 22 S builds** – Dualtron Thunder conversions fit 22 S 11 P packs by crossing cell columns; veterans still recommend stopping at 10 P unless you’re ready for precision machining, and the latest teardown calls for documenting crossed-cell layouts, AWG10 axle limits, fork widening for 70H fronts, and BMS placement before publishing a turnkey 26 S recipe.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L189-L189】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L304-L304】
- **Dual X12 packaging lessons** – Smart Repair’s mixed 70H rear/GT1 front project already needed AWG10 phase leads through the axle and creative BMS placement to clear a 26 S upgrade—plan harness routing before committing to multi-controller layouts, and capture the crossed-cell diagrams so others don’t pinch leads in the fork.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L190-L190】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L304-L304】
- **Noname’s 20 S 32 P moped pack** – The seated build balances ≈9.4 kWh (112 Ah) against a 350 lb curb weight; future iterations will target a lighter 32 S 20 P layout with Seven controllers for better torque, so log enclosure volume, dropout spacing (~165 mm), and weight-handling expectations before copying the stack.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L312-L316】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L322-L323】
- **Segway moped range lessons** – The same platform’s 32 S 20 P refresh plans to redistribute weight and revisit controller selection after the current pack forces awkward lifting; keep these ergonomic notes with your packaging drawings so seated conversions remain serviceable.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L322-L323】
- **Turnkey superbike benchmark** – Russia’s billet RTV Ultra scooter ships with dual 3Shul controllers, 26 S 64 Ah packs, 115 mm stators, and 11×PMT130 tires while quoting six-month lead times, offering a reference for premium turnkey builds.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L191-L191】
- **VSETT 10+ deck with external controllers** – Relocating controllers outside the deck makes room for a 20 S9 P Samsung 48X pack with ~2 mm side clearance in a 169 mm jig; builders pair it with JK active-balancing BMS boards and waterproof Higo/Julet harnesses for serviceable installs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L6371-L6486】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L6501-L6504】
- **Cell chemistry trade-offs** – Sony VTC6A cells sag less and run cooler than Molicel P42A but cost roughly twice as much unless ordering ~10 k pieces monthly, while Samsung 30T remains the punchiest option albeit with limited capacity.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L1603-L1655】
- **Ninebot G30 MAX** – Builders drill and trim 3 mm ePowerFun skid plates for €25 stopgap protection, map roughly 112–120 horizontal 21700 slots (~17 S8 P) with careful copper folding, swap in custom spacers, and plan 20 S4 P-to-22 S layouts once rails are clear and pack supports printed—just avoid mixing aged grey and purple LG M26 variants that upset balance.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L151-L151】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L118-L118】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L184-L184】
- **Xiaomi Pro 2 packaging example** – Relocating the ESC lets a 13 S8 P (104-cell) pack fit with side-mounted BMS modules, highlighting the gains from asymmetrical stacking inside cramped decks.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L109-L109】
- **Ninebot G30 MAX** – Builders drill and trim 3 mm ePowerFun skid plates for €25 stopgap protection, swap in custom spacers, plan 20 S4 P-to-22 S layouts once rails are clear, and now spec 21700 3 S booster bricks with 100 A BMS units after 18650 versions browned out at 60 A.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L151-L151】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L118-L118】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L221-L221】
- **Xiaomi Pro 2 decks swallow 12 S 8 P.** Removing the honeycomb inserts opens space for roughly 96 cells and even dual QS8 battery leads, but tight 6 AWG bends demand careful routing to avoid abrasion.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part006_review.md†L310-L310】
- **Mirono’s 13 S 5 P NCR21700A core** – Rated around 15 A per cell, it launches at 50 A battery and caps near 75 A to preserve longevity while awaiting external packs for AWD expansions.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L309-L310】
- **Stageable AWD upgrades** – Run the dual controller in single-motor mode until a 16 S 5–7 P deck pack or hybrid internal/external pairing is finished; smaller 12 S 3 P strings sag or overheat on VESC launches.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L309-L312】
- **Split touring packs** – 15 S 10 P VTC6 arrays now span deck plus side bags under 150 A/60 A BMS limits with 8 AWG trunks, enabling heavy regen without saturating MOSFETs on long-range builds.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L219-L219】
- **30 S prototypes (Segway/Nami/G3)** – Ausias is CNC-ing supports for 22 S10 P Nami decks, while Finn’s G3 conversion fits 30 S3 P (15 S6 P) modules after bracket cuts; 30 S4 P remains too wide without welding and enclosure surgery.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L159-L160】
- **Fiido compact e-bikes** – Target 16 S packs with 0.2 mm copper strip reinforcement, 3D-printed spacers for 21700 cells, and upgraded motor leads; copper stiffens the busbars but needs high-power soldering gear, and riders planning 14 S8 P/5 kW hub swaps must confirm 135 mm dropouts and ≥45 mm magnet height before abandoning QS205-class hubs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part001_review.md†L46-L48】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L21239-L21247】
- **Mega-controller projects** – Sustaining FarDriver-class 800 A continuous targets requires at least 32 P li-ion groups or high-current LiFePO₄ bricks (~60 Ah, 200 A each), so budget the volume, cooling, and weight trade-offs before chasing 160 kW marketing claims.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L20423-L20488】

## Tooling, Fabrication & Thermal Management
- Budget welders rated for 0.15 mm copper rarely meet spec; proven setups rely on K-Weld or Glitter 811A plus rip-tests, nickel sandwiching, and calibrated power for 0.1 mm sheet.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L34-L34】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L152-L152】
- Turkey-based builders validated the €25 “purple PCB” 12 V welder board when fed by a 72 Ah car battery—it handles 0.2 mm nickel but still lacks the current to weld 0.15 mm copper, so plan on capacitor rigs if customs block pro welders.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L140-L140】
- TIG-welded copper busbars remain the standard for high-current packs—Paolo’s 20 S6 P P45B build is another reminder that nickel alone adds too much resistance at 300 A targets.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L20698-L20700】
- 0.3 mm copper laminates waste weight and money because the weldable layer is still nickel—stick with thinner copper or sandwich welding to keep resistance low without overpaying.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L20898-L20916】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L20943-L20951】
- Keep skid plates functional: thermal paste is required before 3 mm aluminum plates materially sink heat, and fan kits need ducting rather than flush mounts to avoid recirculating hot air.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L119-L120】
- QS8/MT60 panel mounts are mostly custom; teams CAD their own plates to keep phase and battery leads from dangling while preserving access for service loops.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L188-L188】
- Patrick found 10 mm² mains too stiff and dropped to dual 6 mm² conductors while PuneDir mirrored his 10 P nickel so 80 A targets stay symmetric instead of reinforcing only the “red” side.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L163-L163】
- PETG honeycomb carriers and kraftplex skeletons let packs dry-fit without glue, while 25 mm nickel “accordion” strips shorten sense leads and copper/nickel sandwich busbars keep 150 A paths compact in cramped decks.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L214-L216】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L220-L220】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L239-L239】
- Layer plexiglass and fish paper between every series plane before heat-shrink, then route twin packs (20 S10 P + 20 S7 P) through triple XT60 harnesses when you need 150 A bursts without sacrificing insulation.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L164-L164】
- Seal copper sandwiches after assembly or they oxidize quickly; 8 mm nickel remains the sweet spot on 18650 positive rings, and 0.2 mm copper only makes sense once 6 P strings truly see >50 A.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L166-L166】
- Haku’s 3D-printed holders paired with wide fishpaper tape keep copper sheets off can walls and fully insulate every cell face before the final wrap—use the template when building mixed-nickel/copper decks.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L167-L167】
- Vertical 12 S 4 P–5 P 21700 stacks now stand cells on end inside Xiaomi frames with deck spacers, fish-paper wraps, and insulated trays so the aluminium chassis can’t abrade nickel tabs—even 0.8 mm magnet clearances failed without the extra padding.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L16998-L17021】
- EU builders are hoarding 220 mm shrink and 0.25–0.30 mm copper straps because the “thick” 13 S 5 P 21700 rental packs choke on single 8 mm nickel links; budget the wider shrink wrap and multi-strip bussing before scaling above commuter-sized modules.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L681-L682】
- Solid 4 mm or dual 3 mm BMS leads shed less heat than long silicone runs, and connector amp tables are being revalidated after conflicting vendor claims—log actual limits before committing harness designs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L237-L237】
- Nickel cross-section math matters: a 30.4 mm × 0.15 mm strip only nets ~4.56 mm², capping safe series current near 20 A unless you add copper busbars or thicker nickel to curb sag on 12 S commuter packs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L21855-L21875】
- Glass-fibre interlayers and glued parallels keep RePackr-balanced groups uniform in cramped decks, and kraftplex sleeves are replacing scarce fish paper without sacrificing series isolation.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L313-L315】
- Document thermistor retrofits when adding internal sensors: heat-shrink channels and sleeved joints stop axle chafe and preserve insulation on Vsett hubs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L320-L321】

## Range & Touring Concepts
- Mirono’s 3D-printed deck extender packs 260 cells (≈15 S 17 P) for 120 km coastal rides and hints at 600 A peak capability—treat structural reinforcement and cooling as mandatory when chasing similar capacity boosts.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L158-L158】
- Long-haul teams are prototyping cargo trailers and 80 W folding solar panels, logging ~2 A at 36 V during daylight charging while scouting 500 km Bonn-to-coast routes; staged charging plus swappable packs keep journeys practical.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L159-L159】
- Range logs from 12 S 4 P P42A commuter packs show 15–20 km of spirited riding burns ~40 % capacity at 40 A battery / 80 A phase, and the same low-voltage Wheelway hubs overheat quickly without embedded thermistors—plan airflow or cooling before pushing current on similar builds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L19037-L19122】
- Long-distance riders still face hours-long stops: a 274 km (170.4 mi) day on the fast-charged NIU took just under 12 hours despite the 2.2 kW charger, highlighting real touring cadence.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L194-L194】

## BMS & Protection Strategy
- ANT 470 A/1 050 A packs have latched discharge FETs after overnight charges; the community now treats ANT as requiring redundant contactors or manual disconnects and documents UV-inspection resets before declaring hardware dead.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L99-L101】
- **Charge-only workflows** – Some Kaabo builders wire charge-only BMS leads and rely on external JK active balancers or VESC undervoltage cutoffs when deck space is scarce, pairing the setup with main-line fuses and periodic balancer sessions instead of permanent discharge FETs.[^kaabo-20s7p]
- ANT’s published 420 A ceiling leaves Halo-style 22 S 10 P race packs with limited headroom—either parallel two units or accept accelerated wear when chasing 300–350 A discharge goals.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L403-L405】
- ANT’s published 420 A ceiling leaves Halo-style 22 S 10 P race packs with limited headroom—either parallel two units or accept accelerated wear when chasing 300–350 A discharge goals, because each P45B cell is still spec’d at 45 A continuous despite community attempts to pull 300 A+ through a single BMS.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part013.txt†L17525-L17545】
- Riding big packs on charge-only protection is risky—Yamal’s 20 S 10 P commuter runs an ANT board only on the charge side, and peers warned a short could torch the ESC, so document inspection intervals, discharge-side fusing, and escalation plans until a full BMS lands.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L224-L224】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L250-L250】
- Balance behavior differs: ANT bleeds every cell simultaneously but with limited current, whereas JK hardware addresses two series groups at once, making JK preferable for large parallels needing faster equalization.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L174-L174】
- Smart BMS trip faster than fuses: riders remind newcomers that integrated protections catch shorts far quicker than external fuses, so keep charge balancers and discharge FETs in the loop even when packs feel cramped.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part002.txt†L4868-L4888】
- Daly 400 A frames can be revived with LLT logic boards, but the hybrids need shunt recalibration and hardened auxiliary supplies before they belong on 80‑FET, 400 A continuous experiments—treat them as advanced builds rather than off-the-shelf upgrades.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L24344-L24355】
- Regen spikes punish aged packs: a tired 14 S 5 P stack with 100 mΩ cells hit 8.4 V per group during 30 A front-wheel braking, threatening 56 V controllers rated only 60 V—either limit regen near 15 A, add parallels, or retire high-impedance cells.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L292-L293】
- High-speed racers now log ANT 300 A BMS trips near 690 A phase / 160 A battery peaks above 130 km/h, so extend delay timers or upgrade hardware before chasing similar pulls.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L25927-L26063】
- Keep cost spreadsheets realistic: even DIY 20 S packs need €50 BMS units, €50–200 welders, insulation, and shipping cushions—budget builders increasingly hire trusted pack shops when customs make single builds uneconomical.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L155-L156】
- JK hardware has already saved builds from abuse—Noname tripped a 60 A JK BMS by pulling 70 A battery on a C80 conversion and now plans a 20 S 3 P pack instead of bypassing protection.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L280-L285】
- JKBMS’s compact 17 S active-balancing board (≈10 × 8 × 1.7 cm) handles 60 A continuous/100 A burst while redistributing 600 mA per channel, offering smarter balancing than passive Daly units in tight decks.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L270-L270】
- Tape balance looms in place while routing and keep the JST plugged in; Jason notes a mispinned lead usually just keeps the BMS off until corrected, making the workflow forgiving when documented properly.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L134-L134】
- Always land B− before the balance taps on ANT/JBD harnesses—builders fried boards by skipping the ground reference while stepping up cell voltages.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L135-L135】
- Artem’s active-balancing platform shuttles up to 600 mA once any group drifts beyond 0.01 V, clamps charge above 4.22 V, and keeps deviations near 3–7 mV—document those thresholds alongside charger guidance so field techs can validate behaviour during service calls.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L716-L723】
- Daly smart BMS displays still win on UI but ignore remote power-off requests; keep an external antispark inline and be ready to reset latched MOSFETs via the Bluetooth app after deep sags or regen spikes.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L315-L316】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L366-L368】
- Artem’s latest 14 S pack hides dual 3 mm copper busbars under layered insulation and demands a 5 V pre-charge before plugging in the SIM-enabled BMS harness—write that activation order into build docs so installers don’t arc balance leads or latch MOSFETs during bring-up.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L18837-L18854】
- Oversized JBD smart BMS units may force silicone isolation around outputs and custom deck spacers—budget thickness for screw heads and heatsinks, not just PCB height.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L165-L165】
- Patrick’s main JBD app respects the phone’s language and enforces a 15 mV minimum balance delta unless you disable “softlock” via the admin app or switch to English—document that quirk for field techs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L170-L170】
- Calibrate clone ESC shunts with a bench supply and Ohm’s law; PuneDir’s €25 board measured 280 A stock and needed a ~25 A target to match realistic pack limits, and standard multimeters won’t resolve the milliohm resistor without load.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L171-L171】
- Stock GX16-3 charge inlets only stay cool around 3 A because the internal JST pigtail overheats; either parallel pins on a GX16-4 for 6–8 A service or swap to XT30 leads with 16–18 AWG silicone wire before raising charge current.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L21739-L21808】
- Builders weighing upgrades now swap fragile GX16 charge ports for IP67 Cnlinko LP16 connectors, while others keep XT60s for ~20 A duty when weather sealing is less critical.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L144-L144】
- Heavy fast-chargers who push 15–25 A into dual GX16 ports accept accelerated wear and check connector temps mid-charge, whereas commuters favour 0.2–0.3 C overnight balancing for pack longevity.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L21810-L21849】
- Budget “smart” BMS boards remain a packaging trade-off—the latest no-name unit was twice the size of an ANT despite lower amp ratings, while a 21 S 100 A JBD still fit between 18650 rows for €45 during an AliExpress sale.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L189-L189】
- Budget 5 A “travel” chargers that never leave constant-current mode have held 4.3–4.4 A into full packs with no CV taper—treat them as emergency bricks only and invest in adjustable YZPower-style supplies for daily use.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L716-L724】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L724-L731】

## Charging & Maintenance Heuristics
- Per-cell fast-charge math matters: Sony VTC6A groups tolerate roughly 9 A per cell (~63 A on 7 P), Samsung 40T owners eye 0.5 C ceilings around 6×35 A for 6 P packs, and builders cap bulk charging near 30 A even when datasheets hint higher rates.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L9063-L9076】
- Oversized copper busbar packs have comfortably accepted 1.5 kW lunch-break charges, taking a 20 S Sur-Ron battery from ~40 % to 90 % while keeping 260-cell layouts near 18–19 A per group.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L124-L124】
- Keep periodic balance cycles on the calendar—packs left idle for two months drifted out of balance, and moisture ingress soaked a parallel group on a 30 S build, demanding inspections after rain before hammering high-power tunes again.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L160-L160】
- Document J1772 adapter harness wiring when planning road-trip charging: one field build used 12 AWG silicone plus 2.5 mm² leads feeding XT60 + AC outlets and required 2.74 kΩ/1.3 kΩ pilot resistors for public-station handshakes.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L155-L155】
- Budget adjustable 22 S/18 A supplies or multi-voltage 16–24 S/20 A chargers when premium 21 S bricks are sold out, and pair them with ANT BMS sleep timers so dormant packs don’t drift after a month offline.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L166-L167】
- Cap fast-charging on 10 P Samsung 40T commuter packs around 20 A (~1.6 kW); experienced builders call 50 A sessions abusive for both the cells and typical household circuits despite the 60 A discharge rating.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L50-L52】
- PuneDir’s crew is now stockpiling 200 A JK smart BMS units for upcoming high-power packs, leaning into oversized protection hardware as current goals climb.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L273-L273】
- A VESC-swapped NIU NQi is already taking ~33 A/67 V (≈2.2 kW) through its 28 P pack—about 1.17 A per cell—before the owner adds a second charger.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L192-L192】
- A 90 Ah touring pack drawing 33 A (~0.37 C) sparked debate; veterans still cap 12 P packs near 0.1 C despite higher datasheet ratings to preserve cycle life.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L193-L193】
- 95 A EV charger demos look impressive, but a 20 S6 P pack already draws ~6.3 kW at that rate—treat 1 C as the ceiling and watch cell temps if you experiment beyond it.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L245-L246】
- Talk of “40 C” fast charging translates to ~11 kW on a 20 S6 P pack—well beyond typical 10 A household circuits—so XA3-class cells still need industrial infrastructure for minute-long fills.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L142-L142】
- Telecom-derived chargers (Huawei 60 A bricks around US$340 or touchscreen 50 A models near US$260) remain repackaged rectifiers—verify cooling, isolation, and safety claims instead of trusting the marketing gloss.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L247-L247】
- Beware AliExpress “chargers” that are actually constant-current supplies with no CV taper or cutoff—leaving them unattended risks overcharging overnight.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part002.txt†L2721-L2724】
- Treat telecom 100 V bench supplies as bare rectifiers until you add earth bonding and precharge—the community now grounds the chassis and energises AC before connecting packs to avoid arcs and tingling housings.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L18612-L18636】
- Nudging Xiaomi/Ninebot chargers toward 61.5 V via trim pots demands upgraded output capacitors and manual cut-off monitoring; these CC bricks never stop automatically at the higher voltage.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L18653-L18671】
- Skip generic DC bench supplies as primary chargers—they lack CV taper and balancing finesse, so packs leave unbalanced and age faster.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L195-L195】
## Structural & Safety Fundamentals
- Moisture checks matter: Jason traced a persistent imbalance in his 30 S pack to water ingress, reinforcing that waterproofing reviews follow every wet ride before the next high-power outing.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L139-L139】
- Validate copper cross-sections before final assembly: Jason’s copper “sandwich” links focus roughly 150 A through a narrow junction, so he’s running PCB-trace math before signing off on the design—do the same whenever you compress high-current buses into compact plates.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L286-L288】
- Never rely on hot glue alone; use 3D-printed spacers or structural adhesives so weld strips don’t carry mechanical load during transport or crashes.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L172-L172】
- Wrap each 21700 in shrink plus Kapton, slip wax/fish-paper between parallels, sheath the finished block in epoxy board and heavy heat-shrink, and add a cradle strap so 20 S9 P assemblies slide in and out without chafing the deck.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L8927-L8933】
- Shield mixed-metal busbars from air: copper-nickel “sandwich” tabs crack when exposed, so either seal joints with tin interfaces or revert to pure nickel when Sunko-grade welders can’t penetrate copper reliably.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part002.txt†L1640-L1645】
- Keep communal CAD libraries handy—drops like the Fusion 360 SurRon frame model let teams validate 20 S pack packaging and bolt-on brackets digitally before committing to metalwork.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part005.txt†L22392-L22397】
- **ANT BMS app access.** iPhone users can grab the ANT companion directly from Apple’s App Store, so friends can configure packs without sideloading tools.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part010.txt†L19869-L19873】
- PETG holders printed at 100 % infill have proven resilient for compact Xiaomi frames—builders size cavities to 21.4 mm for P42A versus 21.15 mm for 40P cells and rely on PETG’s flex to survive heat cycles without cracking.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L23-L24】
- Preheat winter packs intentionally—charging 20 S systems at 35–40 A up to 84 V soaks cells to ~45 °C and keeps voltage sag predictable when the ride starts in freezing conditions.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L209-L210】
- Honeycomb cell holders add roughly 3 cm to a 20 S stick because of their 1.5 mm walls; inspect for shipping damage (crushed shrink, stray shavings) before sealing packs that rely on the extra spacing.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L290-L291】
  - Builders debating hot-glue compression versus honeycomb cages keep the modular holders for serviceability even when 75200 installs crave every millimetre—plan deck layouts around the added height rather than sacrificing repair access.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L502-L503】
- Plan per-cell discharge ceilings around chemistry limits: LG M50LT packs sag badly above ≈15 A, 35E commuters stay near 7 A per cell, P42A’s 45 A claim is really a five-second burst spec, and Samsung MH1 cells with 30–36 mΩ IR should be reserved for low-amp duty unless you can source 12 mΩ-class Aspilsan alternatives—set controller limits accordingly to preserve longevity.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L340-L345】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L367-L368】
- Disconnect chargers before any welding or pack rework—one builder instantly killed an 80 ¢ charger by working on energized leads, reinforcing the “depower first” rule even on low-cost supplies.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L367-L368】
- Screen “Panasonic” or similar branded packs by weight and weld quality; the group traced range loss and voltage sag to counterfeit cells bundled with 3Shul C700 motors and now treats suspect modules as unsafe for high-speed builds.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L206-L207】
- Match chemistries inside parallels: mixing pouch and cylindrical cells accelerates swelling even when copper busbars handle 350 A/450 A bursts, so spec unified cells or larger BMS hardware (≈230 A) before blending formats.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L39-L39】
- When soldering balance leads onto copper-clad packs, touch the joint for ~0.5 s at 400 °C—the copper acts as a heatsink and avoids warming cells compared with nickel-only tabs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L8874-L8897】
- Resist blending similar-looking 18650 lines: pairing LG MJ1 with MH1 cells in the same parallel string drags voltage once currents exceed ~8 A per cell and undermines 130 A pack targets, so keep parallel groups chemistry-matched.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L7100-L7125】
- Scrap any pierced cell immediately—builders warned that compromised cans trigger cascading failures if reused in high-current packs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L180-L180】
- Honeycomb fish paper layouts let Xiaomi Pro 2 riders squeeze 20 S5 P internally without spacers, but the group still demands meticulous insulation and limits bag batteries to about 20 S6 P unless you accept risky 7 P stacks.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L183-L183】
- Salvaged vape cells arrived wildly imbalanced with unknown provenance; even hobbyists labeled them “pocket-size cancer,” reinforcing the advice to avoid disposable cells in serious builds.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L185-L185】
- Verify “pure nickel” claims—many AliExpress listings hide nickel-plated steel—leave vent paths open with 8 mm strip on 18650 positives, and avoid potted packs without gas gaps.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L187-L187】
- Mixing LG 40T and LG M50LT strings in parallel demands conservative current draw and a smart 150 A BMS so the weaker chemistry doesn’t overheat or drift out of balance.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L188-L188】
- Don’t trust “20 kg, 150 km range” marketing—community math shows 150 km alone demands ~11 kg of cells plus structure, so vet vendor specs before redesigning decks around unrealistic claims.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L25568-L25606】
- Vet “used but tested” Samsung 35E/40T lots for weld scars and elevated IR—community buyers now skip the €2.5–€3 pulls unless sellers document low cycle counts and clean tabs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L16250-L16267】
- Treat Nordbot “premium” packs with suspicion—community photos showed rewrapped Sanyo cells, exposed bus bars, and flimsy insulation that suggest recycled or stolen modules.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L9376-L9399】
- Schedule periodic UV/visual inspections for burned traces on smart BMS boards, especially after preload-failure alarms or unexplained current draw.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L100-L100】
- Use small insulating pads instead of full foam blocks when cradling deck packs so heat can escape; the crew told Cihan to damp rattles without blanketing the battery in thermal insulation.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L138-L138】
- Wrap 8 P sticks with clear 160 mm shrink plus kraft paper so inspection windows stay visible, and rely on XTAR VC8 analyzers over budget LittoKala testers when validating reclaimed 21700 lots.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L271-L273】
- Budget pack shops that lean on silicone blobs and Kapton once threaded inserts strip leave balance leads exposed; veterans insist on rigid spacers, fish paper under every BMS, and thicker mains to avoid the “fire starter” XT30 failures seen in teardown photos.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L19126-L19172】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L19787-L19899】
- Printable trays are evolving beyond scooters—Pandalgns’ 10 S6 P triangular bike pack clamps nickel between bolted columns, adds removable covers for balance taps, and integrates a dedicated BMS base with mesh protection for tight commuter frames.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part010.txt†L10127-L10621】
- Sleeper commuters are iterating thicker 20 S cell-holder prints to hide ~600 Wh in “250 W” frames—Haku’s downloaded Xiaomi fixtures proved too thin, so he and GABE are reinforcing walls while Pandalgns models a beefier 20 S8 P cage for daily abuse.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part010.txt†L10127-L10621】
- GABE’s attempt to solder nickel straight to cells triggered another reminder to avoid the hack—light sanding is a last resort—and Jerome now outsources welding to a 24 kW capacitor rig after trashing two overheated packs, underscoring the risk of DIY copper work without serious gear.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part010.txt†L18743-L18766】
- Welding debates from the same thread stressed that ≈1 kA pulse capability and enough voltage to overcome joint resistance matter more than headline kW ratings when joining steel or copper buswork.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part010.txt†L18982-L19024】
- Noname proved a shared 9 × 12 in heatsink can host dual VESCs with minimal thermal-paste loss provided you budget deck space; later he kept a single controller near 40 °C at 6 kW with pads, paste, and planned ram-air ducting while Haku’s setup still peaked around 70 °C—use their logs as controller cooling benchmarks during pack planning.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part010.txt†L19035-L19044】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part010.txt†L20140-L20158】
- Mirono now refuses to build small packs without honeycomb cages or holders; sanding Xiaomi frame rails and adding rubber liners keeps 12 S 4 P 21700 packs plus VESC looms from chafing against the aluminium tray.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L19913-L19947】
- A mishandled Mirono pack shows why retention hardware matters—deck rails wore through fish paper, Kapton, and shrink when the battery slid loosely, so add foam blocks or brackets and photograph deliveries to document condition.[^mirono-chafe]
- Courier builds that rip through antisparks now bed connectors in silicone and jump to 8 mm bullets once M3 threads strip—plan mechanical reinforcement alongside electrical upgrades so high-current harnesses survive daily swaps.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L18939-L18955】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L19126-L19129】
- QS8 anti-spark plugs are replacing AS150 on 100 A+ scooters thanks to their 110 A continuous rating and the new 6 AWG solder cups, which pair cleanly with 6 mm² phase looms when dual controllers climb past 60 A battery per side—even if EU pricing still hovers around CHF 21.50 per pair.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L10421-L10520】
- When paralleling extender packs, match voltages before connecting, use XT90/Y harnesses on common-port BMS designs, and let multiple chargers share the constant-voltage stage so each supply tapers naturally as the packs equalise.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L20518-L20539】
- QS8 connectors handle roughly 70 A continuous but take valuable deck space; many riders now substitute 8 mm bullets for compact high-current runs while keeping XT90S on sub-45 A projects.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part002_review.md†L208-L208】

## Build Checklist
1. **Lock in cell supply** – confirm volume, customs path, and aging tests for each batch of 50PL/50E/P45B cells before welding.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L35-L37】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L155-L156】
2. **Spec welding & busbars** – validate welder output on scrap strips, target 0.1–0.2 mm copper, and document Glitter/K-Weld maintenance steps for the build log.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L34-L34】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L152-L152】
3. **Mock the enclosure** – dry-fit spacers, skid plates, and controller mounts to prove 22 S9 P–30 S3 P geometries before live welding—PuneDir’s steel box missed the Hyosung frame opening by 1 cm, stranding the build until a new shell was cut.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L37-L45】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L151-L160】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part008_review.md†L139-L139】
4. **Layer protection** – choose BMS hardware with known reset workflows, add external fuses/contactors, and rehearse ANT fault recovery with UV inspection gear.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L99-L101】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L174-L174】
5. **Secure the pack** – replace hot glue with interlocking supports, torque QS8/MT60 mounts, and apply thermal paste before final enclosure torque-down.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L119-L120】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L172-L172】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L188-L188】
6. **Stage controller, pack, then motor upgrades** – High-voltage conversions show the biggest ride gains after upgrading the VESC, then the battery, and only then the hub; even modest motors tolerate 3–4× nameplate power once cooling is sorted.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L303-L304】
6. **Prep service harnesses** – pre-soldered AS150 leads now ship with 8 AWG mains and four 24 AWG signal wires, making 70 A quick-disconnects trivial—stock spares and document polarity before field installs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L272-L272】
