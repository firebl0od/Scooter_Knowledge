# DIY Battery Supply & Pack Architecture Playbook (2025)

## TL;DR
- Europe’s salvage stream of EVE 50PL cells pushes landed costs near 1 € per cell while U.S. buyers still face ~$9 retail, so teams are forming cross-border partnerships and stockpiling QS8 hardware ahead of tariff hikes.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L34-L38】
- High-power scooters are converging on 22–30 S frames with 8–11 P parallels: Dualtron Achilleus decks accept 22 S9 P packs once controllers move outboard, Nami race builds run 22 S11 P Molicel layouts toward 40 kW, and G30 conversions rely on upgraded skid plates and spacers to clear 20 S+ modules.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L37-L45】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L151-L160】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L168-L169】
- Smart BMS headroom still lags pack ambition: ANT discharge FETs can latch on failures and balance slowly, so builders pair structural pack supports (no hot glue) with redundant protection, UV inspections, and JBD/JK alternatives sized around 500 A continuous until 700 A units mature.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L99-L101】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L155-L156】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L172-L174】

## Cell & Component Sourcing Reference
| Component | EU Pricing & Availability | North America Reality | Immediate Actions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **EVE 50PL 21700** | Salvaged Stark Varg modules deliver grade-A cells for ~1 € each after labor; retail bulk hovers 1.5 € with logos shaved yet still grade A.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L35-L36】 | ~$9 per cell retail with looming import duties.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L36-L38】 | Form cooperative buys, pre-clear customs brokers, and reserve storage for incoming pallets. |
| **Samsung/EVE 50E variants** | €1.5–2 each keep commuter packs affordable when 50PL supply tightens.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L155-L156】 | Similar pricing once landed but subject to tariff swings; easier sourcing than 50PL yet lower discharge ratings.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L155-L156】 | Stage these as fallback chemistries for ≤200 A builds; adjust wiring gauge accordingly. |
| **EVE 40P 21700** | Builders facing €47-per-pair Samsung P42A quotes and scarce 50S inventory lean on 40P cells for balanced cost and discharge, giving up ~1 Ah versus 50E while doubling current headroom.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L142-L143】 | U.S./import-limited teams can source 40P more reliably than 50S; plan customs paperwork early to avoid shipping refusals.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L142-L143】 | Document discharge targets and temperature logs so commuters understand the trade-off versus premium P42A or 50S packs. |
| **Molicel P45B / Samsung 40T** | Used in 22 S10/11 P race packs with 0.2 mm copper busbars and 350–500 A targets.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L37-L39】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L168-L169】 | Importable but pricier; rely on trusted builders when tooling costs outweigh one-off packs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L39-L39】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L156-L156】 | Schedule welding capacity, busbar stock, and thermal monitoring for >300 A continuous expectations. |
| **QS8 connectors** | Stock through EU vendors today, but panel-mount options remain custom-fabricated.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L188-L188】 | Tariffs threaten to push unit cost toward $35; panel mounts rare.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L38-L38】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L188-L188】 | Bulk-order straight housings, print or machine mounts, and document safe connection sequences. |
| **Smart BMS (JBD/JK/ANT)** | JBD units land around €50 for 20 S packs; JK units offer higher balancing throughput but larger footprints.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L155-L155】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L174-L174】 | ANT advertises 470 A–1 050 A but has logged discharge latch failures; redundancy required.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L99-L101】 | Combine smart BMS with external fusing/contactors and publish reset workflows for stuck FETs. |
| **Spot welders (K-Weld, Glitter 811A)** | Proven 0.1 mm copper welds at ≈300 € including PSU; Glitter 811A needs periodic pin cleaning to restore 4.4 kA output.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L34-L34】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L152-L152】 | Cheaper 90 € claims lack field proof on copper; shipping heavy welders across the Atlantic adds cost.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L34-L34】 | Allocate budget for pro-grade welders or coordinate shared tooling with nearby builders. |

## Pack Architecture Patterns
- **Dualtron Achilleus conversions** – Deck cavity (~485 mm × 181 mm) supports 22 S9 P if controllers move to an external mount; stock decks hold 20 S7–8 P and ~100 A battery before needing relocation or compact ESCs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L37-L44】
- **Nami “hotdog” racers** – 22 S11 P P45 builds pair 100 H rear / 70 H front motors, 500 A phase, 550 A absolute, and 100 % front FW to sync wheel speed, netting 146 km/h GPS with manageable 61 °C stator temps.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L168-L169】
- **Ninebot G30 MAX** – Builders drill and trim 3 mm ePowerFun skid plates for €25 stopgap protection, swap in custom spacers, and plan 20 S4 P-to-22 S layouts once rails are clear and pack supports printed.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L151-L151】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L118-L118】
- **Xiaomi G30 sleeper builds** – Dual 50 H hub experiments weigh 16 S against 20–22 S packs using PETG holders printed at 100 % infill; fixtures are sized for 21.4 mm P42A vs. 21.15 mm Samsung 40P cells and flex before cracking as packs warm, while new 20 S trays hide ~600 Wh inside “250 W” commuters without telegraphing the upgrade.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L20-L21】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L102-L103】
- **Printable 16 S commuter cases** – Pandalgns’ trays route balance leads through removable covers and scale to triangular 10 S6 P bike packs with bolted nickel columns plus dedicated BMS bases and mesh guards.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L21-L22】
- **Peak G30 structural refresh** – Reprint deck spacers in 100 % PETG and stack Kapton+copper so every conductor stays on the pack’s top side; add a plastic isolation sheet to shield wraparound bus bars inside tight deck tolerances.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L279-L280】
- **MiniMotors MP2 chassis** – A 22 S2 P (~650 Wh) pack fits entirely inside the frame while keeping the electronic brake functional; expect ~35 km at 70 km/h on a 250 W high-speed hub, skip field-weakening because stator heat jumps ~1.5×, and plan for optional 24 S extensions by stacking six extra 21700 cells beneath the ESC.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L71-L72】
- **Cold-weather 20 S9 P commuters** – Jerome favors EVE 40P for a 20 S9 P pack thanks to low resistance and winter performance, while Patrick sticks with Samsung 40T when customs block EVE imports and wires Lonnyo 16×4 hubs for star/delta swaps to chase 120 km/h later.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L154-L156】
- **30 S prototypes (Segway/Nami/G3)** – Ausias is CNC-ing supports for 22 S10 P Nami decks, while Finn’s G3 conversion fits 30 S3 P (15 S6 P) modules after bracket cuts; 30 S4 P remains too wide without welding and enclosure surgery, and hobbyists are even chaining three Segway 10 S packs to trial 30 S without bespoke welding as controller supply catches up.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L159-L160】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L275-L276】
- **28 S ambitions (Apollo Phantom)** – Resist stacking two 14 S packs in series; veterans build dedicated 28 S 5 P packs with separate smart BMS units (ANT was cited) to avoid imbalance faults and series-pack runaway when voltages drift.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L242-L243】

## Tooling, Fabrication & Thermal Management
- Budget welders rated for 0.15 mm copper rarely meet spec; proven setups rely on K-Weld or Glitter 811A plus rip-tests, nickel sandwiching, and calibrated power for 0.1 mm sheet.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L34-L34】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L152-L152】
- Keep skid plates functional: thermal paste is required before 3 mm aluminum plates materially sink heat, and fan kits need ducting rather than flush mounts to avoid recirculating hot air.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L119-L120】
- QS8/MT60 panel mounts are mostly custom; teams CAD their own plates to keep phase and battery leads from dangling while preserving access for service loops.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L188-L188】
- Manage copper busbars carefully: wraparound 20/22 S2 P builds kept every conductor on the top deck but nearly overheated the copper bridges during welding—anneal or otherwise control heat when working with thin PETG carriers.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L309-L310】

## BMS & Protection Strategy
- ANT 470 A/1 050 A packs have latched discharge FETs after overnight charges; the community now treats ANT as requiring redundant contactors or manual disconnects and documents UV-inspection resets before declaring hardware dead.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L99-L101】
- Balance behavior differs: ANT bleeds every cell simultaneously but with limited current, whereas JK hardware addresses two series groups at once, making JK preferable for large parallels needing faster equalization.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L174-L174】
- Keep cost spreadsheets realistic: even DIY 20 S packs need €50 BMS units, €50–200 welders, insulation, and shipping cushions—budget builders increasingly hire trusted pack shops when customs make single builds uneconomical.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L155-L156】

## Charging & Maintenance Heuristics
- Cap fast-charging on 10 P Samsung 40T commuter packs around 20 A (~1.6 kW); experienced builders call 50 A sessions abusive for both the cells and typical household circuits despite the 60 A discharge rating.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L50-L52】
- 95 A EV charger demos look impressive, but a 20 S6 P pack already draws ~6.3 kW at that rate—treat 1 C as the ceiling and watch cell temps if you experiment beyond it.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L245-L246】
- Telecom-derived chargers (Huawei 60 A bricks around US$340 or touchscreen 50 A models near US$260) remain repackaged rectifiers—verify cooling, isolation, and safety claims instead of trusting the marketing gloss.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part010_review.md†L247-L247】

## Structural & Safety Fundamentals
- Never rely on hot glue alone; use 3D-printed spacers or structural adhesives so weld strips don’t carry mechanical load during transport or crashes.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L172-L172】
- Match chemistries inside parallels: mixing pouch and cylindrical cells accelerates swelling even when copper busbars handle 350 A/450 A bursts, so spec unified cells or larger BMS hardware (≈230 A) before blending formats.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L39-L39】
- Schedule periodic UV/visual inspections for burned traces on smart BMS boards, especially after preload-failure alarms or unexplained current draw.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L100-L100】
- Double 10 AWG phase leads rarely fit standard 8 mm bullet shells cleanly—Haku defaults to 10 mm hardware and only forces 8 mm housings by soldering then shaving the joint, so plan connector size before committing to dual conductors.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part010.txt†L11527-L11529】

## Build Checklist
1. **Lock in cell supply** – confirm volume, customs path, and aging tests for each batch of 50PL/50E/P45B cells before welding.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L35-L37】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L155-L156】
2. **Spec welding & busbars** – validate welder output on scrap strips, target 0.1–0.2 mm copper, and document Glitter/K-Weld maintenance steps for the build log.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L34-L34】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L152-L152】
3. **Mock the enclosure** – dry-fit spacers, skid plates, and controller mounts to prove 22 S9 P–30 S3 P geometries before live welding.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L37-L45】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L151-L160】
4. **Layer protection** – choose BMS hardware with known reset workflows, add external fuses/contactors, and rehearse ANT fault recovery with UV inspection gear.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L99-L101】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L174-L174】
5. **Secure the pack** – replace hot glue with interlocking supports, torque QS8/MT60 mounts, and apply thermal paste before final enclosure torque-down.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L119-L120】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L172-L172】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L188-L188】
