# High-Voltage VESC Controller Market (2025 Snapshot)

## TL;DR

- Spintend’s mature 85 V line still anchors budget 20–22 S builds, but unresolved throttle jitter, capacitor stress on heavy hubs, and a wave of 12-FET failures keep veterans steering high-mass projects toward larger "fat VESC" platforms or FarDriver-class hardware.[^1]
- Stepping from 16 S to 20 S trims current draw and adds ≈2.5 km/h per series cell, yet 100 V-class MOSFETs carry ~33 % higher Rds(on) than 75 V parts while pack length, insulation, and safety checks all get harder.
  - plan enclosure space and thermal margin before chasing headline voltage gains.[^2]
- Vedder’s new Maxim 120 V ecosystem (Maxim singles, Duet dual, and the companion smart BMS) finally gives builders an official high-voltage option, yet the ~€530 bundle, STM32F4 control, and limited field data spark debate against cheaper Chinese controllers.[^3]
- Vedder also teased a palm-sized “VESC Express Micro” controller for 36–48 V scooters: it promises 50 A continuous / 100 A dual-channel output with onboard logging and Express integration, providing a compact option for youth builds despite offering roughly half the battery current of a Ubox 100/100.[^4]
- 3Shul’s CL-series and Tronic X12 controllers occupy the premium tier for riders chasing 23 S+ or 500 A ambitions, but supply volatility, firmware transparency, and pricing nearly double that of Spintend/Ennoid alternatives require group-buy planning and spare telemetry gear for validation.[^5][^6]
- Makerbase’s 84xxx HP hardware has emerged as the dependable mid-budget foil: real-world logs show it surviving 22 S abuse when wiring is clean, while 12-FET Spintend stages continue to brown out under heavier riders despite water-cooling success stories.[^7]
- Raphaël Foujiwara’s dual-VESC prototype targets 100 V packs with 12 TO‑247 MOSFETs per motor, 400 A phase / 300 A battery goals, and a 110 × 110 mm footprint, but the €200 MOSFET bill and twin STM32s already push projected pricing beyond €1 000 unless assembly is automated.
  - highlighting the cost pressure on boutique duals.[^raphael-proto]
- Riders are still begging for accessible 100 V/80–100 A-per-channel controllers.
  - Paolo’s single-channel prototype and any future Nucular 12F restock remain top-of-mind while the $1 300 BAC4000 is dismissed as overpriced for scooter duty.[^8]
- Compact single-channel contenders are arriving: ENNOID teased a 100 V/75 A board in a 70 × 75 × 16 mm shell (~$200), and Spintend’s single-core preview aims for ≈100 A with active cooling in an XT90-sized case priced around $150.[^9][^10]
- Rider comparisons pit €400-per-side Tronic/Little FOCer stacks (100 A battery / 250 A phase) against Spintend duals that bundle heatsinks, while YYK square-wave units earn points for short-circuit survival despite lacking VESC tuning.
  - underscoring the trade-offs between configurability, price, and robustness.[^11][^12]
- Community builders are filling the 200 A single-controller gap.
  - Face de Pin Sucé is prototyping a native VESC rated around 200 A continuous so high-current scooters can avoid industrial drives while retaining Vedder firmware.[^13]
- Enthusiasts are cataloging MOSFET part numbers across Nucular, Vsett, and Ubox hardware, comparing sub-2 mΩ Rds(on) claims against Chinese alternatives like HUASHUO HSP0076A devices to validate marketing sheets.[^14]

## Controller Landscape Reference

| **Tronic X12** | ≈24 S capable; ~20 kW from 12 FETs, eleven electrolytic caps, bundled 6 AWG leads, onboard ESP32/VESC Express, color-coded voltage SKUs (100 V blue, 24 S red, 150 V violet) | Considered a drop-in for high-output builds, but storefront outages and firmware access limit availability | Race scooters needing >400 A phase with proven logs and spare controllers on hand[^24][^6][^27] |
| **3Shul CL350** | Comfortably runs 23 S+ with robust capacitor banks; community pegs it above Spintend for power headroom | Manufacturer transparency still thin; price nearly double Spintend, so teams lean on group buys and Voyage Megan dashboards for CAN telemetry | Heavy QS/LY hub builds where budget covers premium controllers and logging accessories[^5][^28] |
| **Tronic X12** | ≈24 S capable; heavy-duty shunt sensing stock | Considered a drop-in for high-output builds, but storefront outages and firmware access limit availability; Paolo pegs real-world ceilings closer to 600 A battery despite 1,000 A marketing because the platform still leans on older MOSFET packages | Race scooters needing >400 A phase with proven logs and spare controllers on hand[^24][^6][^29] |
| **VESC Express Micro (preview)** | 36–48 V target, ≈50 A continuous / 100 A dual-channel | Integrates Express telemetry in a notably compact footprint, drawing interest for Peak G30 youth builds that can live with the lower battery current ceiling | Lightweight scooters needing VESC tooling and logging without the bulk or amperage of full-size dual controllers[^4] |
| **VESC Labs Minim 100 V** | ≈35 A battery / 180 A phase | Compact harnessing and official firmware appeal to e-moped builders, but FarDriver boxes still win on higher battery current when space allows.[^minim_tradeoff] | Lightweight mopeds and scooters that prioritise tidy wiring and VESC Tool integration over raw amperage.[^30] |
| **3Shul CL350** | Comfortably runs 23 S+ with robust capacitor banks; community pegs it above Spintend for power headroom | Manufacturer transparency still thin; price nearly double Spintend, so teams lean on group buys and Voyage Megan dashboards for CAN telemetry.
  - budget riders still default to Spintend 85150/85250 for similar builds when cost trumps headroom.[^cl350_value] | Heavy QS/LY hub builds where budget covers premium controllers and logging accessories[^5][^28] |
| **3Shul CL500** | 32 S-rated, ≈500 A phase / 250 A battery with revised low-profile capacitor stack | Drops regen entirely; Face de Pin Sucé coordinating EU distribution while Rage Mechanics handles support | Large 11″ hub scooters chasing 20 kW+ without water cooling.[^31][^32] |
| **3Shul CL700 / CL1000** | Taller housings reaching ≈700–1,000 A phase envelopes; dual power plugs ease heavy-gauge wiring | Regen currently unsupported; shipments staged through Rage Mechanics with pricing north of CL350 | Track and drag builds that can feed 300 A battery continuously and budget parallel pack capacity.[^33] |
| **VESC Labs Maxim 120 V** | Official 120 V single controller with exposed capacitor bay and STM32F4 control | First-party option from Vedder; awaiting independent benchmarks from "VESC museum" testers | Builders prioritizing VESC firmware pedigree over raw amps, especially on e-moped conversions[^3] |
| **VESC Labs Duet (Dual)** | 100 V peak, 150 A phase per side | Ships with the Maxim launch; price and MCU headroom questioned versus Chinese duals | Premium commuters needing official support and integrated smart BMS[^3] |
| **Thor400-32S** | Advertises 32 S support, 400 A absolute, ESP32 telemetry, Thor300-compatible packaging | Community engineers doubt the 12 V/5 A aux rail and busbar sizing.
  - expect MOSFET teardowns before trusting the spec sheet.[^34] | Builders intrigued by Thor’s feature set but waiting on validation before committing |
| **Spintend single-channel (preview)** | Target ≈100 A battery with active cooling; XT90-sized housing without onboard BLE | Production samples add silicone pads, tidier layouts, and easier serviceability than early betas, but builders still double-check pinouts before reusing harnesses to avoid smoking refreshed boards.[^10][^35] | Compact scooters upgrading from stock controllers that can add airflow and external BLE modules[^10][^36] |
| **Flipsky 75/200** | Advertised as A200S-class single | Shares legacy heat issues; veterans are waiting to see if recent revisions actually raise thermal limits before trusting it at high battery current.[^37] | Treat as experimental until independent thermal data proves it can hold >60 A battery without overheating. |
| **Seven 18 Prototype** | Early 18-FET entrant bundled with Express board | Firmware and pin mapping remain incomplete; requires separate Express module today | Early adopters documenting CAN behavior and pushing vendors toward GPL compliance[^38][^39] |
| **MP2 Open-Source ESC** | Community-targeted 100 V/300 A stack (F405 + modular busbars) | Group buys revived EU production; expect mostly through-hole assembly (18 MOSFETs, pin headers) plus heat-beds for busbars and a bring-your-own firmware workflow | Makers who prefer open hardware, need 300 A envelopes, and can validate their own cooling/heatsink designs.[^40][^41][^42] |
| **Seven TOLL/TOLT (upcoming)** | Modular 18- and 30-MOSFET stacks in 100/135/150 V trims with multilayer PCBs packed with thermal vias, swappable VESC Express daughterboards, CNC housings, twist-throttle accessories, and even a 400 V variant on the roadmap | Still in preview.
  - watch for production pricing and enclosure machining timelines | Builders planning premium duals who want Seven’s ecosystem once hardware ships[^43] |
| **MP2 Open-Source ESC** | Community-targeted 100 V/300 A stack (F405 + modular busbars) | Group buys revived EU production; expect DIY soldering, heat-beds for busbars, and a bring-your-own firmware workflow | Makers who prefer open hardware, need 300 A envelopes, and can validate their own cooling/heatsink designs.[^40][^41] |

## Reliability & Warranty Lessons

- Spintend RMAs still stumble: owners document denials tied to firmware versions (e.g., 6.05), making firmware provenance logs essential before shipping hardware back.[^44]
- Seven 18 boards still route heat through FR4 vias instead of IMS plates; Face de Pin Sucé is steering racers back to proven C350 hardware until thermal performance improves.[^45]
- Racers chasing 22 S competition builds find Spintend’s 100 V/100 A units underpowered; Yamal and 🇪🇸✨عمر are delaying entries until they can budget Ubox 22 S or Spintend 240 A upgrades (often with MOSFET swaps).[^46]
- Riders remain skeptical of Tronic’s advertised 1,000 A claims.
  - community dyno estimates put practical limits nearer 600 A and highlight the platform’s reliance on older MOSFET technology compared with Toll-package Spintend hardware.[^29]
- Skip the bulky Kelly-style clones: riders report poor efficiency, uncontrolled start-up current, and melted wiring compared with modern VESC hardware.[^47]
- Heavy riders blowing 12-FET Spintend stages after only a few miles underscores the need to derate compact controllers for rider mass and verify bullet connectors aren’t loosening under vibration.[^48]
- Face de Pin Sucé’s latest logs show 18 FET G300s overheating faster than 12 FET IMS units once you push beyond street tunes, so he now steers budget buyers toward Spintend 85/250s or 3Shul C350 hardware if they truly need 22 S / 400 A headroom.[^49]
- Spintend is actively prototyping aluminum-core singles (6- and 12-FET) with thicker copper, SH8/6 AWG leads, and firmware-locked tiers while Artem tunes single-controller guardrails (~130 A phase / 50–60 A battery) and pushes for better QA staffing.[^50]
- Spintend users keep flipping hardware revisions.
  - new 75 V/100 V kits bundle ADC boards and pads
  - while discovering quirks like Flipsky hall auto-detection that stutters until parameters are entered manually, reinforcing the need to log firmware changes and manual tuning steps.[^51][^52]
- Rage Mechanics confirmed Haku’s new “22 S-capable” powerstage came from Raphaël Fujiguara’s RFP shop, which also swaps MOSFETs and supporting components to survive 22 S abuse.
  - Haku will still shake it down on 20 S before chasing the 30 kW benchmark the crew now treats as baseline.[^53]
- Rosheee’s Tronic 750 checklist (30 S envelope, 550 A phase continuous, 350 A+ battery) ships with zero warranty coverage.
  - treat every order as experimental hardware and budget spares.[^54]
- EtorroS called out the CL1400 teasers: despite 30 S / 1,000 A marketing, early demos already blew MOSFETs, so teams are waiting on independent logs before committing deposits.[^55]
- Smart Repair traces many controller deaths to workmanship.
  - scratched insulation, loose bullets, unstable observers
  - so implementing checklist inspections before power-up is as important as choosing a premium ESC.[^25]
- Makerbase 84xxx HP controllers can survive 22 S punishment once wiring faults are resolved, yet the latest attrition logs underscore that harness diligence alone may not prevent catastrophic failure.[^56][^57][^58][^59]
- New July reports show the opposite: 75100s failing at cruise, 75200s DOA, and stationary ignition fires reinforce that Makerbase remains a risky stopgap for anything above commuter power levels.[^57][^58][^59]
- Persistent throttle jitter on Spintend 85/240 and 100/100 hardware, plus random spikes logged on refreshed 85/250 v2 units, point to lingering ADC filtering and grounding issues that must be solved before customer delivery.[^17]
- Flipsky’s refreshed 75×200 board now bundles Bluetooth yet still lacks native power control.
  - budget external switches or BMS gating as before.[^60]
- New 75×200 repairs still demand full MOSFET swaps and restored input capacitance; boards missing bulk caps have blown again after partial fixes.[^61]
- Non-aluminum 75100 enclosures continue to desolder FETs when pushed beyond ~450 A phase / 300 A battery, reinforcing the shift toward aluminium cases or higher-tier controllers for those loads.[^62]
- JPPL’s Flipsky 75×200 failure logged 350–370 A phase spikes per wheel before every MOSFET died, showing how MTPA plus 600 A limits overwhelm stock hardware when BMS trips finish the stage mid-run.[^63]
- Ubox duals have been popping near 250 A battery spikes while the aluminum single-80 V revision proves markedly more reliable than the older 100 V single.
  - Zero 10X owners are steering toward the alu board or C350/3Shul alternatives when packs can deliver >100 A.[^64]
- Water-cooled Ubox stacks do hold temps ~4 °C over ambient at 90 A battery / 130 A phase, but tariffs and failure anecdotes are already nudging shops to preorder the rumoured €180 18-FET alternative to hedge supply.[^65]
- CL-series controllers stay efficient above 24 S; CL1000 logs show 23 kW at 600 A phase / 300 A battery with only +11 °C heating, while Raphaël recommends C-series hardware for lower-voltage scooters.[^66]
- Field-weakening remains the silent killer: 20 S Spintend 85150 logs show 45 A FW layered on 105/120 A battery and 150/175 A phase outputs roasting MOSFETs unless the powerstage is upgraded to HY or HSBL009N10T devices with hotplate-plus-hot-air rework.[^67]
- Tronic 250 batches have shipped with dead CAN rails; owners are running mirrored throttle signals and isolating 3.3 V until replacements arrive, underscoring the need for spare comms hardware on premium orders.[^68]
- Spintend 85/150 units mislabeled as 100 A have already popped input capacitors mid-ride and even melted CAN jumpers; budget time for RMA delays or pivot upmarket when planning 20 S commuters.[^69]
- NetworkDir is steering Dualtron owners toward the dual Ubox 100 V/100 A kit plus ADC v3 lighting module after repeated Makerbase and Flipsky issues, highlighting a more reliable mid-tier path.[^70]
- Jason’s MP2 roadmap clarifies that the six-FET-per-phase stack holds ≈300 A continuous with ~450 A hardware OC, giving DIYers an open-source alternative when commercial supply dries up.[^71]
- Even boutique Little FOCer/Tronic 250 lineage boards start dying near 200 A; Yamal recommends keeping them around 150 A per controller for longevity.[^72]
- Cheap FOCer 3 controllers (≈70 A battery/120 A motor continuous with active cooling) tempt compact builds, but riders note that Flipsky minis already deliver higher power in smaller footprints.
  - budget testing time before switching platforms.[^73]
- Flipsky 75350 hardware can hang with 19 kW bursts and 15 kW sustained loads once firmware spikes are tamed.
  - Gordan’s Surron build is the latest proof before riders abandon the platform entirely.[^74]
- Paolo flagged boutique Chinese MOSFETs (e.g., JJMicro) whose datasheet specs proved bogus during bench tests.
  - he now trusts Huayi-sourced parts and plans swaps even on new Spintend light boards to avoid repeat failures.[^75]
- HY-branded Spintend replacement stages stay capped around 20 S (~400 A phase) unless Raphaël’s HF filters and cooling mods are added—treat them as service parts, not 22 S upgrades.[^hy_limit]
- Multiple 85/250 units are now arriving DOA or dying within weeks at ~200 A battery / 170 A motor.
  - stock spares or pivot to Seven/3Shul while the revised 85/240 ships via New Jersey to keep high-phase projects alive.[^76][^77]
- Treat “too good to be true” AliExpress listings as scams and build a vendor-vetting checklist (stock proof, response cadence, component sourcing) before wiring money.
  - the €140 “Spintend” storefront that appeared with thousands of units in stock ignored all messages, and the BOM alone costs more than the asking price.[^78][^vetting_checklist]
- Kelly 7212/7218 controllers still earn “random death” reputations despite waterproof housings, whereas Sabvoton’s 95 V kits pair TVS-protected hardware with enough regen headroom for 18 S commuters so long as charge voltage stays under ~75 V.[^79]

## Field-Weakening & Thermal Guardrails

- Treat field-weakening amps as additive to battery draw; riders pushing 45 A FW on Ubox 85150s at 105/120 A battery and 150/175 A phase have already cooked MOSFETs.
  - plan FET upgrades or higher-voltage motors instead of stacking FW on stock hardware.[^67][^80]
- Safe envelopes converge around ≤45 °C controller temps and ≤90–100 °C stator temps; thermal paste between controller bases and plates is mandatory before chasing 300 A bursts.[^16]
- Logging both GPS speed and per-motor temperatures helps correlate duty cycles with real thermal load, preventing overconfidence when scaling toward 400 A per motor on dual stacks.[^81]
- Real-world benchmarks peg 72 V dual-motor builds around 80–110 km/h when each controller sustains ~100 A battery; pushing a single motor toward 16.8 kW still overheats hardware even with field weakening, so plan dual drives or higher-voltage motors for sustained speed runs.[^82]
- 100 H/70 H Nami race builds prove that 500 A phase and 550 A absolute limits are workable when traction control reins in front-wheel lift at 120 km/h+, but only with disciplined temperature monitoring (~61 °C stator during 40 kW pulls).[^83]

## Firmware & Tooling Watchlist

- VESC Tool 6.06 introduced temporary Bluetooth pairing breakage (fixed in 6.06.4), so teams relying on phone-based tuning should stage rollback paths to 6.05 or USB flashing kits before field tests.[^84]
- Precompiled “no hardware limits” binaries exist for Ubox 85250 v2, but the desktop tool already bundles signed firmware.
  - educate newcomers to avoid sketchy third-party downloads.[^85]
- Windows builds of VESC Tool 6.05 still fail to launch for some riders; export your beta configs, install the official release, flash the matching firmware, then restore the backup so throttle and limit settings survive the upgrade.[^86]
- Voyage Megan CAN displays are emerging alongside CL350 dual installs, reinforcing the need to validate accessory compatibility when mixing premium controllers with Spintend ADC boards or Express modules.[^5][^87]
- 3Shul quietly hosts CL350 V3 firmware on an official Drive share.
  - grab the archive before it disappears so you can compile 6.2-capable builds when vendors lag behind.[^88]
- Seven’s bundled Express board still fails to enumerate, so plan for a separate CAN-connected Express module until firmware and 26-pin header maps are released under the GPL.[^38][^39]
- Early Seven 18 shipments also lacked the GPL-mandated source release, so teams are pressuring vendors to publish code before large-scale Maxim or Seven deployments rely on closed firmware drops.[^licensing_note]
- Shops continuing to flash 5.03 on Ubox hardware should be nudged toward 6.05+ to unlock traction control and resolver fixes; bundle NRF flashing guides so UART displays and BLE telemetry coexist cleanly.[^89]
- Early VESC Express adopters report 6.06 auto-restarting SD logs every ~3 s; stay on 6.05 or update via CAN with manual restarts until a patch lands for the new board.[^express_logging]

## Procurement & Pricing Signals

- Water-cooled Spintend builds remain attractive but hardware inflation and pending 18-FET alternatives (~€180 targets) warrant monitoring before bulk purchases.[^65]
- Resellers like Fastride continue to leave riders waiting months for replacement controllers.
  - some are preparing PayPal disputes after silence on €800 orders
  - so plan redundant suppliers or stock on-hand hardware before your primary board fails mid-season.[^8][^90]
- 3Shul previewed the CL500/CL700/CL1000 stack with 12 ToLL FETs, integrated Bluetooth, ≈500–1,000 A phase envelopes, and 32 S capability (no regen); Face de Pin Sucé is already sprinting a 31 kW build while Rage handles EU distribution.[^91]
- CL350 samples now land with flattened capacitor stacks and dual power plugs so the board fits tighter decks without shaving terminals.
  - update packaging CAD and wiring plans accordingly.[^92]
- Raphaël reiterates that CL controllers only make sense once voltage climbs above ≈80 V; 60–72 V commuters should stay on C-series hardware to avoid needless size, cost, and regen loss.[^93]
- EU riders secure EVE 50PL cells for €1–1.5 each while US buyers face ~$9, prompting cross-border sourcing, customs planning, and early stockpiling of QS8 connectors before tariffs spike prices toward $35.[^94]
- Watch controller sourcing lists: overpriced “dual 75100” enclosures, revised Flipsky 75200s missing bulk caps, and Vsett 10 packs lacking fast over-current protection are all on the community’s QC radar.[^95]
- Group buys continue shaping premium hardware access: hardened 160 mm brake discs, Seven 18 controllers, and Voyage Megan dashboards are all moving through curated batches rather than retail shelves.
  - document order windows and spares budgeting alongside controller selections.[^96][^87]
- Alibaba listings of discontinued Tronic/Seven controllers now come straight from the original contract manufacturer; pricing mirrors the defunct brand but buyers should expect minimal support and plan self-managed repairs.[^97]
- JPPL’s X12 install details a compact 88 × 38 × 70 mm extrusion with a 12 × 80 × 100 mm base plate; because the onboard rail only supplies 5 V at ≈150 mA, builders pair the controller with Spintend’s ADC board plus an external buck for 12 V accessories.[^98]
- BAC 4000 bundles remain a tough sell at ~$1 300 given they still require reseller-flashed motor profiles and leave amp limits murky compared with VESC/Nucular ecosystems.
  - budget-conscious builders are pausing purchases until support improves.[^99]
- Tronic’s latest promo pushes X12 bundles at $598 for pairs (or $450 each) while quietly advertising 26 S capability; tempting, but confirm hardware revisions and harness pinouts before banking on the deal.[^100]
- BAC’s locked firmware and hub-specific provisioning continue to frustrate scooter builders.
  - pairing unapproved motors voids warranties and leaves compliance modes stuck behind resellers, reinforcing the pivot toward open VESC/Nucular stacks despite BAC’s polished police-mode features.[^101]
- Nucular staff flagged a Russia-based reseller advertising matching specs as unauthorised; expect grey-market stock at best and treat any “factory new” claims as suspect when controllers bypass official channels.[^102]
- Take advantage of regional arbitrage: Spain’s @jordidelvalle is exporting grade-A P45B modules cheaply, Finn is selling 50 € G30 VESC harnesses in Germany, and Alibaba contract manufacturers are liquidating Tronic hardware with minimal support commitments.[^103][^87]
- Heavy-duty hub supply is consolidating: Face de Pin Sucé still sources 75 mm magnet / 110 mm stator motors with 10 mm² phase leads for ≈€750 a pair, plus Rion/Weped FF-spec hubs near €340 each in France.
  - budget freight padding if you plan to match controller upgrades with premium motors.[^104]

## Action Checklist for 2025 Builds

1. **Log firmware versions and tuning files** before submitting warranty claims so vendors cannot dismiss failures as “wrong firmware.”[^44]
2. **Scope thermal interfaces** on every controller install.
  - remove cases, refresh paste, and confirm plate clamping pressure prior to high-current shakedowns.[^16]
3. **Plan CAN telemetry** (Express boards, Voyage Megan displays, smart BMS) alongside controller purchases to benchmark Maxim, Duet, CL350, and X12 units against existing Spintend logs.[^105][^106][^107]
4. **Pre-buy consumables**.
  - QS8 connectors, grade-A 50PL cells, capacitor upgrade kits
  - before tariff shifts and supply dips force redesigns mid-project.[^94][^87]
5. **Document field-weakening policies** (amp ceilings, duty start points, observer settings) per vehicle so future tuners avoid repeating the MOSFET failures logged on 20 S Spintend builds and understand the traction-control dependencies on 100 H race scooters.[^67][^108]
6. **Track open-hardware momentum.** MP2 busbar soldering workflows (heat beds, CRST030N10N FETs, 8–10 AWG phases) and EU group buys signal renewed appetite for community-maintained 300 A controllers.
  - log lessons learned alongside commercial hardware tests.[^109]

## Source Notes

- Controller reliability, firmware tooling, and field-weakening guardrails consolidate the late-2025 VESC Help Group slices that compared Spintend, Makerbase, Tronic, 3Shul, and VESC Labs hardware while documenting throttle jitter, warranty friction, traction-control tuning, and thermal practices for 20–23 S builds.[^110]
- Procurement signals, pricing pressure, and accessory availability draw from the same review covering tariff impacts, group buys, regional cell arbitrage, and Voyage Megan/Express integration updates for 2025 projects.[^111]
[^express_logging]: VESC Express modules currently loop ride logging on 6.06 builds, forcing users to log over CAN/SD with manual restarts until firmware fixes arrive.[^112][^113]
[^licensing_note]: Seven 18 prototypes arrived with 6.06 firmware but no source code, prompting community reminders that GPL compliance is required before broader release.[^114]
[^raphael-proto]: Raphaël detailed his dual-channel board (12 TO‑247 MOSFETs per motor, 100 V, ~400 A phase / 300 A battery targets) and noted STM32 plus MOSFET costs alone push pricing beyond €1 000 unless production is automated.[^115]
[^hy_limit]: Replacement HY power stages sourced through Raphaël Foujiwara should stay on ≤20 S (~400 A phase) until HF filters and extra cooling are added.
  - 22 S experiments remain risky even with the new boards.[^116][^117]
[^external_mount]: Builders keep CL350s outside cramped decks or in stem-mounted bays to preserve airflow on 80 H/100 H conversions, despite the extra fabrication.[^118]
[^janu_hub]: Deal hunters snag 90 H × 127 mm hubs from Janu for ≈$380, yet they still avoid Makerbase 75100 V2 and Flipsky FT85BD controllers because of reliability complaints, defaulting to Spintend or better pairings.[^119]
[^ubox_ceiling]: Community consensus keeps Ubox 85250 ceilings near 250 A battery and 360 A phase before diminishing returns, based on dual-stack logs and shared dyno data.[^120][^121]
[^dual_lite]: Dual Ubox Lite owners report reliable operation near 200 A battery / ≈130 A phase per side; higher targets only raise heat without adding thrust.[^120][^121]
[^cl350_value]: Riders comparing 3Shul CL350 to Spintend note the former’s superior output and reliability but nearly double price, pushing budget builds back to Spintend controllers unless space or thermal headroom demands 3Shul hardware.[^122][^123]
[^minim_tradeoff]: Compact e-moped teams weigh Minim 100 V’s tidy harnessing (≈180 A phase, ~35 A battery) against FarDriver’s higher-current, lower-cost trapezoidal controllers before deciding whether firmware polish outweighs raw amperage.[^30]
