# Motor Cooling & Thermal Management Notes

## Why Fans Rarely Help Scooter Hubs
- Denis Yurev reminded the workshop that scooters already move fresh air past the hub at riding speed, so bolt-on fan kits add little cooling compared with ensuring good heat transfer from the windings to the shell.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L422-L441】
- Riders debating CPU-style blowers learned that evaporation-driven skin cooling does not apply to dry aluminum shells; without a wet surface the only lever is temperature delta, so focus on conductive paths instead of add-on spinners.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L424-L441】
- Veterans recommended ferrofluid or oil-fill experiments (with leak safeguards) if you need real winding-to-shell transfer—simply drilling covers or gluing “windmills” to the hub only cools the outer case.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L456-L520】

## Controller Interface Refresh Checklist
- When raising voltage, replace Kapton tape with 0.5 mm thermal pads so MOSFETs stay isolated yet shed heat; stacking pads on top of Kapton just adds resistance.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L202-L223】
- Sand controller bases, clean MOSFET tabs, and reinstall paste before clamping the box—loose wiring under the plate prevents full contact and spikes temperatures on the first ride.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L60020-L60025】
- Keep silicone pads on hand when chasing 48 V/15 S tunes; the crew pairs IRFB4110 MOSFETs with 100 V 1,000 µF and 47 µF capacitors and swaps pads plus paste before closing the case.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L60009-L60024】

## Temperature Guardrails
- Battery temps around 41 °C were deemed healthy for summer rides, but the group flagged ~60 °C as a ceiling—anything hotter accelerates degradation and calls for gentler tunes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L60004-L60008】
- Larger packs and long shocks trap heat around the deck; riders re-bend frames, add inner/outer steel plates, and swap to lower-rate springs instead of trimming coils so the chassis and cells stop cooking each other.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L90030-L90136】

## Coil Retention & Harness Dressing
- Inside hub motors, standard nylon cable ties survive stator temperatures when cinched correctly; some builders still wrap phases with cotton rope for redundancy, so combining both methods keeps windings tight without melting ties.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L185-L185】

## VSETT Hub Recovery Workflow
1. **Current discipline first:** Cap single-motor VSETT tunes around 140–160 A phase and 90 A battery before the first test ride—pushing 190 A phase cooked fresh hubs within a few kilometres.[^vsett-limits]
2. **Rebuild scorched joints:** Strip enamel with flame, flood the discoloured phase terminations with flux, solder until copper shines, and clean stray solder before reinstalling grommets to prevent shorts.[^vsett-rework]
3. **Add sensing before retests:** Glue a 2×4 mm EPCOS/TDK thermistor against the laminations near the hall bundle so the controller can pull back before magnets unglue.[^vsett-ntc]
4. **Raise sensorless handoff:** Once the motor is healthy, lift the sensorless transition target from ~500 eRPM to roughly 3,000 eRPM, pair it with ~20 A of field weakening, and stretch FW ramp times (~800 ms) so launches stay smooth above 55 km/h.[^vsett-handoff]

## Hub Motor Inspection & Upgrades
- **Treat “new” hubs as used cores.** Recent VSETT shipments arrived rusty with loose magnets and carbon dust; strip corrosion, re-glue magnets with Loctite AA326, and demand refunds if sellers dodge warranty support.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L138-L138】
- **Respect thermal envelopes.** Fresh 60 mm hubs run well around 50 A battery and 100 A phase once ferrofluid is added and phase joints are clamped; 11″ torque hubs shed magnets when hammered with sustained 200 A+ phase plus heavy FW, so dial current back before the glue fails.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L139-L140】
- **Inject ≈4.5 ml of ferrofluid carefully.** Pop RTV-sealed grommets or crack the cover, loosen the cable gland, and syringe Statorade along the slots—spray greases contaminate bearings, so plan on replacing them if you skip the clean fill.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L205-L205】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L217-L217】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part004.txt†L8825-L8851】
- **Grease geared hubs judiciously.** Semi-fluid fills cut winding cooldown times dramatically but double rolling resistance and may seep through rotor bolts; log temperatures and trim the fill after each ride until drag settles.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L320-L320】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part004.txt†L21602-L21637】
- **Benchmark semi-fluid grease vs. Statorade.** Start with 20–30 % fill on geared hubs, monitor leaks around the axle, and compare coast-down distance against straight ferrofluid setups before recommending it to customers.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part004.txt†L21602-L21637】
- **Watch conductor cross-sections.** The stock 2.5 mm² phase bundle in Blade hubs melted under 110–155 A bursts; upgrade to 4–6 mm² silicone cable through the axle and keep halls tidy to prevent repeat failures.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L177-L178】
- **Plan cable routing before upsizing.** JPPL flattens the phase exit with spacers, swaps to 4–6 mm² low-profile insulation, and even presses the axle out a few millimetres rather than drilling; Thierry confirms 60 H axles can be partially pressed to snake new wires without hammer damage.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L379-L379】
- **Reseal hubs after solder work.** After re-soldering VSETT phase leads, flood the chamber with potting compound around the cable exit, add strain relief on the hall harness, and validate sensors before closing the cover.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part004.txt†L1085-L1148】
- **Zero 11X hill climbs expose airflow limits.** Dual Ubox builds running 135 A phase, 80 A regen, and stock AWG 12 leads overheated motors before controllers; riders trimmed regen, only nudged zero-vector frequency while watching ESC temps, stripped paint, flipped cases toward airflow, added ducts, and upsized leads/connectors for 20 S 9 P packs drawing ~130 A battery.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part004.txt†L13838-L14043】
- **Reseal hall boards after rewires.** Close motors with Kaufer/Kafuter RTV-704 silicone around the hall PCB so vibration doesn’t lift the board after you’ve pulled new leads.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L380-L380】
- **Maike “3000 W” hubs crave current and cooling.** Swapping to a Ubox 75 V 100 A×2 left top speed stuck at ~25 km/h until the owner raised motor current toward 140 A, battery ≈70 A, and added frame-mounted pads or fans—dual XT60 commuter packs still bottleneck VESC upgrades.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L354-L354】
- **Beware waterlogged temp sensors.** 1 kΩ PTC harnesses that sat in water pegged Spintend temp channels at 90–95 °C; dry or replace the harness before raising firmware trip limits to avoid masking a real fault.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L355-L355】
- **Cool brakes gradually.** Magura calipers that smoke after emergency stops need rolling cooldowns—parking immediately boils the fluid and forces a bleed before the next session.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L141-L141】
- **Log Statorade performance.** Fresh fills cooled windings faster but still showed large case-to-sensor deltas, signalling more fluid or better thermal paths are needed for sustained pulls.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L262-L262】
- **Top-up workflow:** For quick Statorade refreshes, remove the side cover, wick old fluid with lint-free swabs, inject 2–3 ml along the slots, spin the wheel to distribute, and reseal immediately to keep dust out.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part004.txt†L9072-L9133】
- **Record volumes and deltas.** Builders logging 60 H hubs report 4–5 ml fills cutting peak temps 10–12 °C; document baseline vs. post-fill data for future comparisons.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part004.txt†L12745-L12760】
- **Quantify efficiency penalties.** Even 7 P packs feeding 330 A battery / 400 A phase returned <50 % motor efficiency without airflow, burning 133–162 Wh/km and demanding low tire pressures for grip—proof that sealed hubs punished beyond their cooling envelope just waste energy.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L208-L208】
- **Respect high-Kv limits.** A Xiaomi Pro 2 with a ~130 km/h no-load hub still overheated to 50 °C at 30 km/h despite ferrofluid; swap to lower-Kv winds or soften launches until speed climbs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L273-L273】
- **Prioritise airflow over exotic loops.** Riders chasing water-cooled plates and 20 kHz PWM on Bronco/Zero builds saw more realistic gains by stripping paint from heatsinks, carving airflow channels, and orienting Ubox cases into the airstream.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L235-L235】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L281-L281】
- **Mount controllers firmly for heat sharing.** Xiaomi/Blade swaps only held 70 °C rollbacks at bay after bolting Flipsky 75100s to the frame with proper pads and disabling phase filters post-detection.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L291-L291】
- **Upgrade harnesses during rebuilds.** Stuffing 3–4 mm² phase leads plus dedicated temperature sensors through Blade/Xiaomi axles remains tight—use purpose-made looms and consider PT1000 probes for cleaner telemetry.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L293-L293】
- **Retrofit PT1000 sensors cleanly.** Slide PT1000 probes into the axle alongside the hall bundle, insulate with Kapton sleeves, and isolate signal leads from high-current phases to prevent noise on Blade and Xiaomi builds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part004.txt†L16340-L16353】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part004.txt†L16476-L16488】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part004.txt†L16607-L16608】
- **Track-tested heat budgets.** JPPL and Simone logged 130–150 km/h runs on 20–22 S 40T/VTC6A packs; treat those speeds as race-only territory with full protective gear and meticulous chassis prep.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L373-L373】
- **Hall sensors saturate fast.** Simone’s 145 km/h pull cooked 41F hall ICs and discoloured the cable exit—pair high-speed hubs with ferrofluid and plan ≥10 mm² conductors before repeating long pulls.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L384-L384】
- **Keep exit angles shallow.** After upsizing leads, stagger splices outside the dropout and flatten the cable path so insulation doesn’t burn through at the bearing shoulder during high-speed runs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L385-L385】

## Adhesives & Sensor Retention
- Hall sensors that walk out of their slots should be glued with heat-tolerant RTV 704 or slow-drying high-temp silicone; super glue works after scuffing the pocket but runs hotter under load.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L131261-L131275】
- Keep 704 RTV on the bench for accessory wiring too—the same adhesive secures buck-converter leads so vibration cannot snap them before the scooter ever rolls out.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L31-L32】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L131265-L131275】

## High-Power Build Snapshots
- **Dense Mantis builds need airflow plans.** Simone’s 21 S 6 P Samsung 35E Mantis (and earlier 24 S 7 P 40T pack) pushes >32 kW at 82 V yet relies on SmartDisplay telemetry, external spacers, and added airflow to keep 3Shul controllers alive at 22 S 200 A.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L356-L356】
- **Compact commuter packaging is possible.** Face de Pin Sucé’s 24.8 kg daily rider squeezes a 21 S 6 P Samsung 35E pack, narrowed FHT60 motor, and SmartDisplay into an 8.5″ stealth build—proof that careful packaging can deliver 75 km/h without race weight.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L357-L357】

## Frame & Stem Alerts
- **Inspect Ninebot F-series stems.** The elongated aluminium pole flexes and can bend at the harness drill-through; treat it as weaker than Xiaomi’s 45° pipe and inspect for play before hard riding or VESC conversions.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L344-L344】

[^vsett-limits]: VSETT hubs overheated and stalled after only a few kilometres when riders pushed 190 A phase / 90 A battery; capping phase near 140–160 A kept the single-motor builds alive.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L19-L19】
[^vsett-rework]: The same teardown called for stripping enamel, re-soldering discoloured joints with a high-watt iron, and cleaning stray solder before reassembly.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L19-L20】
[^vsett-ntc]: Builders glued 2×4 mm EPCOS/TDK thermistors at the hall bundle to monitor stator laminations before resuming high-power tests.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L44-L44】
[^vsett-handoff]: Raising sensorless transition to ~3,000 eRPM with ~20 A field weakening and ~800 ms FW ramps cured low-speed stutter while smoothing top-end pulls above 55 km/h.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md†L20-L21】
