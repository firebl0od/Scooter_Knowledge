# Motor Cooling & Thermal Management Notes

## Why Fans Rarely Help Scooter Hubs
- Denis Yurev reminded the workshop that scooters already move fresh air past the hub at riding speed, so bolt-on fan kits add little cooling compared with ensuring good heat transfer from the windings to the shell.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L422-L441】
- Riders debating CPU-style blowers learned that evaporation-driven skin cooling does not apply to dry aluminum shells; without a wet surface the only lever is temperature delta, so focus on conductive paths instead of add-on spinners.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L424-L441】
- Veterans recommended ferrofluid or oil-fill experiments (with leak safeguards) if you need real winding-to-shell transfer—simply drilling covers or gluing “windmills” to the hub only cools the outer case.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L456-L520】
- Community case studies still favour passive conduction upgrades over active plumbing: Mirko’s 15 mm aluminum deck plate plus open vents held dual 190 A phase / 70 A battery runs near 52 °C, while heat-pipe experiments outperformed vibration-prone water loops on cramped decks.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L115-L115】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L240-L240】

## Controller Interface Refresh Checklist
- When raising voltage, replace Kapton tape with 0.5 mm thermal pads so MOSFETs stay isolated yet shed heat; stacking pads on top of Kapton just adds resistance.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L202-L223】
- Sand controller bases, clean MOSFET tabs, and reinstall paste before clamping the box—loose wiring under the plate prevents full contact and spikes temperatures on the first ride.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L60020-L60025】
- Keep silicone pads on hand when chasing 48 V/15 S tunes; the crew pairs IRFB4110 MOSFETs with 100 V 1,000 µF and 47 µF capacitors and swaps pads plus paste before closing the case.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L60009-L60024】
- Deck-mounted controller plates should be sanded to bare metal and paired with thin thermal pads; open-vent decks plus 15 mm aluminum plates have proven the most repeatable way to keep single- and dual-motor builds near 50 °C under 190 A phase loads.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L115-L115】
- Hard-mount controllers whenever possible: bolting a MakerX HI100 to an aluminum cradle dropped case temps to ~23 °C on 60 A battery / 200 A phase pulls at 7 °C ambient versus 60–80 °C when the unit was bag-mounted.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L13806-L13840】
- Mirko’s machined radiator plate hangs roughly 3 cm below the frame (7.5 cm ground clearance unloaded) and needs insulated FET interfaces plus potential heat pipes to spread hotspot load—log spacer stacks and insulation plans before copying the design.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L6630-L6678】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L7291-L7303】

### Deck Radiator & Thermal Interface Experiments
- Community photos comparing thick paste bridges against bare ergal vs. 6061 plates showed paste still outperforms air gaps, but PCB-mounted probes can lag case temperature by several degrees—treat onboard telemetry as relative trends, not absolute hotspots.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L7540-L7582】
- VSETT stator rewinds revealed lacquer-shelled star points barely wetted from the factory; torch the enamel, brush clean, and fully re-solder before running fresh motor detection to cut resistance and heat soak.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L23963-L24010】
- Heat-pipe arrays are supplanting water loops on compact decks; builders now pair finned pipes with QS8-class harnesses and 10 mm² (≈8 AWG) leads when paralleling external packs so 80 A continuous transfers without cooking insulation.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L16419-L16455】

## Temperature Guardrails
- Battery temps around 41 °C were deemed healthy for summer rides, but the group flagged ~60 °C as a ceiling—anything hotter accelerates degradation and calls for gentler tunes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L60004-L60008】
- Larger packs and long shocks trap heat around the deck; riders re-bend frames, add inner/outer steel plates, and swap to lower-rate springs instead of trimming coils so the chassis and cells stop cooking each other.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L90030-L90136】
- Track riders without ferrofluid kept hubs between 90–105 °C; pushing past that threshold accelerates demagnetisation and warrants fluid or gearing changes before raising current further.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L103-L103】

## Coil Retention & Harness Dressing
- Inside hub motors, standard nylon cable ties survive stator temperatures when cinched correctly; some builders still wrap phases with cotton rope for redundancy, so combining both methods keeps windings tight without melting ties.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L185-L185】

## Motor Service & Reseal Workflow
1. **Inspect and document joints on arrival.** Photograph stator terminations—heat-discoloured joints or undersized leads justify either an RMA or a full re-solder before the wheel ever spins.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L324-L325】
2. **Clean and treat the air gap.** Pull the stator, wipe debris, and inject 2.5–5 ml of ferrofluid between magnets on sealed 10–11″ hubs so the fluid stays clean and actually improves conduction.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L25766-L25784】
3. **Log temperatures before and after dosing.** Capture stator temps on your first rides to prove the delta—community logs treat before/after telemetry as the only reliable way to justify ferrofluid work.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L25766-L25811】
4. **Refresh bearings and thermal interfaces.** Replace bearings, regrease seals, and reapply quality thermal paste before closing the case—skipping the step has already cost riders several km/h of top speed post-service.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L326-L326】
5. **Seal the cavities before reinstall.** Pressure-wash or silicone-seal swingarms and cable exits so the freshly serviced hub stays dry once back on the scooter.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L327-L327】
6. **Re-terminate suspect stator joints.** Builders torch off lacquer and reflow dry factory solder on VSETT star points before buttoning up the hub; the effort drops phase resistance and head temperatures once the motor detection is rerun.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L23963-L24010】

## Adhesives & Sensor Retention
- Hall sensors that walk out of their slots should be glued with heat-tolerant RTV 704 or slow-drying high-temp silicone; super glue works after scuffing the pocket but runs hotter under load.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L131261-L131275】
- Keep 704 RTV on the bench for accessory wiring too—the same adhesive secures buck-converter leads so vibration cannot snap them before the scooter ever rolls out.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L31-L32】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L131265-L131275】

## Race-Day Thermal Lessons (Aug–Oct 2022)
- **Traction-control heat tax.** September logs showed traction control spiking Ubox MOSFET temps beyond manual launches on high-speed pulls; plan extra heatsinking or relax slip limits for long straights.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L71-L71】
- **Custom radiator geometry.** Mirko’s copper plate project demanded precise clearance checks and highlighted carbon bar weak points around the mounts—document spacer thickness and connector strain relief before copying the design.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L73-L73】
- **Track prep for rotors and hubs.** Late-September race crews paired field-weakening builds with premium rotors (Trickstuff, Huameng high-kV hubs) and shared brake logistics; capture torque specs and spare-part lists when organizing similar events.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L80-L80】
- **Brake fade autopsy.** Magura calipers demagnetised after glowing-red stops (>700 °C), reinforcing the need for cooling laps, fresh pads, and engine braking plans before endurance sessions.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L82-L82】
- **Lighting and ferrofluid upkeep.** Artem’s 60 W 9–80 V lamp tests plus community ferrofluid sourcing debates underscored the value of scheduled fluid refreshes and beam audits when prepping scooters for night races.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L81-L81】
- **Field-weakening ROI.** Logs from December track days showed 20–30 A FW on 16 S builds barely adds top speed, while 50–55 A FW on 20 S hardware delivered ~20 km/h gains but demanded BMS and traction-control tuning to prevent trips—voltage still beats brute-force FW for sustained pace.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L149-L150】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L184-L184】

## Brakes, Rotors & Tire Pressure Guardrails
- Daly BMS current limits, 90–105 °C motor thresholds, and Trickstuff vs. Kool-Stop vs. Shimano vs. XLC rotor comparisons set expectations for 100 km/h scooters—log consumable wear whenever you change pad compounds and capture bigger-rotor plus engine-braking combos that kept Magura calipers from demagnetising after 700 °C track laps.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L103-L103】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L8386-L8400】
- PMT slicks run happiest near 2.4 bar for general track use, Vsett racers push 3.5 bar, and experiments at 1.8 bar shredded cords while 4.2 bar CST setups lost grip; document rider weight alongside PSI to make data shareable.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L111-L111】
- Wolf/VSETT remanufacturers now order custom 3 mm rotors and 10 mm² phase looms when chasing >300 A launches—provide CAD templates with hardware orders so machine shops hit the necessary clearances.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L218-L219】
- XLC vs. Ashima floating rotor tests on dual G30s continue to inform braking upgrades—capture rotor thickness and pad compound notes during A/B trials.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L109-L109】
- Vsett fan-shroud experiments with 12 V/0.6 A blowers showed external fans can hold 6.2 kW pulls near 50 °C when paired with mesh filters and damp weather, but builders still plan motor NTC installs before removing firmware limits.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L133-L133】
- Magic Pie 5 hubs clawed back launch torque by raising motor current to ~120 A while capping battery draw near 25 A—log both currents when retuning so thermal gains don’t hide BMS stress.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L14277-L14307】
- Ferrofluid dosing guidance has settled around 2.5–5 ml for 10–11″ sealed hubs—apply between magnets after stator removal, log temps before/after, and skip open hubs where grit will contaminate the fluid.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L25766-L25811】

### Forced-Air Controller Pods & Harness Consolidation
- Kirill’s Xiaomi build mounts dual ESCs in printed side pods that funnel oncoming air; regen-only braking from 70–80 km/h keeps rotor heat down while planned aluminum skins and XT60-class connectors protect against impact and vibration.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L18986-L19004】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L7283-L7284】
- High-power harness bundles now merge throttle, lighting, power, and brake-sensor wiring into single multi-pin connectors, leaving 7 mm bullets for phase leads and AS150 or QS8 for battery feeds—plan strain relief before routing under deck plates or custom pods.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part003.txt†L19431-L19437】
