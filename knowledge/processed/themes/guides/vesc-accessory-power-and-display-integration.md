# VESC Accessory Power & Display Integration Checklist

## Purpose
This guide distills field reports on powering lights, horns, and dashboards from aftermarket VESC controllers so builders avoid overloading regulator rails or frying logic accessories during swaps.

## Quick Reference Matrix
| Controller family | Native accessory rails | Verified limits & caveats | Recommended mitigations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Tronic X12 | 5 V logic (≈150 mA) | Rail cannot sustain heavy peripherals such as displays or fans without brownouts.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L360-L361】 | Budget an external buck converter for any load above small sensors and throttle/gear switches.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L360-L361】 |
| Spintend Ubox 85×/24× | 5 V logic, 12 V rail (rated 3 A) | Riders only trust the 12 V feed for a brake light; dual 18 W lamps in parallel overstressed the converter even before adding tail lighting, and the older ADC V2 board only provides ~3.3 V/30–40 W so halogen H1/H3 bulbs instantly cook MOSFETs and housings.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L430-L431】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L307-L308】 | Keep lighting minimalist or offload to a dedicated buck; fuse each branch so single shorts do not collapse the regulator and stick to LED loads until replacement ADC hardware arrives.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L430-L431】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L307-L308】 |
| Spintend X12 / upcoming 120 V | 5 V rail only (~150 mA) | The compact extrusion exposes just a weak 5 V output, so Express boards and lighting demand a separate buck or the ADC adapter plus DC/DC combo.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L140-L144】 | Pair the ADC board with an external step-down to feed 12 V lighting, and mount panel QS8 connectors to tidy high-current leads.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L140-L145】 |
| MakerBase 75×/85×/X12 bridge | 3.3 V ADC, 5 V UART/Comm | Hall throttles must stay near 3.3 V; 5 V injection into ADCs burns STM32 inputs, and older Xiaomi 5 V throttles still need resistor ladders whereas the 3.3 V variants can wire straight in.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L503-L505】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L329-L329】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L405-L408】 | Measure throttle min/max before connection; insert resistor ladders or shunt regulators if the lever exceeds 3.3 V.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L503-L505】 |
| Any high-load build | External 12 V/20 A buck | Horns and compressors spike current; expect ≈4–6 A draw from a 60 V pack when heavily accessorised.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L400-L401】 | Adjust controller battery limits to preserve BMS overhead; isolate horns on separate fuses or relays.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L400-L401】 |

## Power Sequencing & Harness Safety
1. **Order matters on dual-rail harnesses.** Feeding 5 V into a Flipsky Smart Display before the 12 V lead repeatedly destroyed Spintend ADC daughterboards; always energise 12 V first, then 5 V, and confirm the display ground is shared with the controller.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L366-L367】
2. **Map every connector before power-up.** MakerBase looms expose 3.3 V/GND/ADC1 at the “comm” header and reroute Bluetooth through the NRF pins; miswired TX/RX leads cause telemetry dropouts or back-power logic rails.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L368-L368】
3. **Decouple bargain BLE modules.** Solder a 10 µF ceramic across VCC/GND on nRF51822 breakouts—the €2 boards survive once filtered, but the ultramini modules that ship with Vedder firmware still have almost no range, so plan on the larger 2 € stick antennas for reliable links.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L326-L327】
4. **Plan a real shutdown path.** Spintend’s ADC adapter v2 only ferries 5 V/12 V accessory power—add loop keys, smart-BMS latching buttons, or dedicated ignition switches when you need to isolate the pack.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L504-L506】
4. **Retain Xiaomi dash resistors.** The series noise-filter resistor is not optional; match the OEM value/wattage when adapting dashboards or CAN bridges so ADC readings stay stable.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L307-L309】
5. **Match temperature probes to firmware.** Wrong NTC tables or series-count settings can blank the dashboard until you align sensor profiles or temporarily spoof S-counts during troubleshooting.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L436-L437】
6. **Secure hall boards and sensor looms.** Hall PCBs that peel free can short against the rotor housing and mimic logic-rail failures; inspect adhesive and strain relief during reassembly.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L603-L604】
5. **Exploit the ADC harness features.** Spintend’s ADC v3 board already supports spin dial throttles, dual-button pods, and turn-signal LED strips—plan channel assignments before closing the deck and keep phase leads equal length when trimming looms.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L209-L210】
6. **Leverage CAN power sync sparingly.** Spintend 85-series controllers share a CAN power line, so a single button can wake both units once linked; treat it as a logic trigger and avoid stacking accessory loads on the shared feed.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part011_review.md†L19016-L19035】
7. **Use CAN headers for logic, not lighting.** Smart Repair’s harness can back-feed 5 V lights through the CAN plug, but riders add inline resistors and rely on the servo PWM pads when they need flashing indicators instead of constant-on lamps.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part012_review.md†L19323-L19405】

## Display & Telemetry Options
- **SimpleVescDisplay (ESP32).** Smart Repair recommends flashing the open-source SimpleVescDisplay and 3D-printing its mount as a reliable alternative when Flipsky Voyage units glitch.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L367-L367】
- **VESC-Express (ESP32-S3).** The €20 CAN↔BLE/Wi-Fi bridge adds LED or remote control outputs and modernises telemetry without touching fragile UART dongles.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L418-L418】
- **VESC Express logging quirks.** Firmware 6.06 currently restarts SD logging every ~3 s and Spintend X12 rails only offer 5 V/150 mA, so power Express boards from a dedicated buck and stick to 6.05 (or plan CAN updates) until patches land.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L5969-L6037】
- **Secondary UART headers.** When Voyage displays misbehave, moving telemetry to MakerBase’s TX2/RX2 header stabilised data without firmware changes; ensure extension leads are shielded if the replacements are short.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L518-L518】
- **Voyage Megan expectations.** The IPS Megan dash may launch at €300–400 with GPS and a custom app, but early adopters doubt demand above ~€150 because SmartDisplay already covers similar telemetry for less—budget accordingly before preordering.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L378-L379】
- **Stealth OEM casings.** Builders zip-tie TFT displays into stock dashboards or relocate them to auxiliary handlebars with 3D-printed mounts when they need legal-looking installs that still expose VESC telemetry.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L45-L47】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L57-L58】
- **Split CAN telemetry.** Dual-controller logs can show ~500 A phase on Voyage/Ambrosini dashboards even when each controller only pulls ~250 A—set per-controller CAN IDs or run dual sessions when you need wheel-specific diagnostics.[^per-controller]
- **Flipsky Voyage quirks.** G2 owners report the Voyage/Flipsky UART display only shows GPS speed even with correct wiring—plan for custom dash scripts or SmartDisplay integrations if you need richer telemetry.[^voyage]
- **Analog gauge reality check.** Chrome-clad needle gauges rarely add data beyond what VESC already logs; most riders stick with phones or SmartDisplay dashboards unless they want retro aesthetics.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L144-L145】

## Accessory Load Planning Workflow
1. **Audit native rails.** Before paralleling dual 12 V outputs, verify continuity—builders suspect some Ubox taps share a single buck regulator, making combined 30 W loads risky.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L547-L547】
2. **Decide external vs. onboard power.** If planned accessories exceed 3 A at 12 V or 150 mA at 5 V, route them through an external buck tied to the main battery with proper fusing rather than the controller rail.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L360-L361】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L430-L431】
3. **Preserve regen braking.** Disabling the BMS charge FET weakens regen—confirm the charge path is active before relying solely on motor braking for testing or street riding.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L505-L505】
4. **Limit regen totals to pack capability.** When paralleling packs directly, match voltages and budget regen to the sum of both packs’ charge ratings; diode isolators caused throttle cut-outs on mismatched modules.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L550-L552】
5. **Plan for 5 V-only controllers.** X12-class builds need a dedicated buck for anything beyond sensors—budget space for the converter alongside the ADC board and document wiring so the accessory rail stays within its ~150 mA ceiling.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part014_review.md†L140-L144】

## Lighting Hardware Spotlight
- **Tail-light drivers matter.** Sequenced tail-light strips either need integrated flasher ICs or external MOSFET drivers; powering 48 V accessories off the main pack still calls for a dedicated DC-DC or auxiliary battery to avoid stressing controller rails.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L141-L144】
- **Skip halogen retrofits on ADC V2.** The 3.3 V/≈30–40 W accessory rail on Spintend’s older adapter instantly overheats halogen H1/H3 bulbs; stay on step-down-fed LEDs or low-watt motorcycle lamps until revised boards ship.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L307-L308】
- **Offbondge projector upgrade.** Riders migrating from 1,300 lm compact beams report Offbondge’s 2,000–2,500 lm projector headlight slots straight into existing 12 V harnesses, spreads light without dazzling traffic, and still benefits from external bucks or fused rails on single-controller builds.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L404-L404】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L571-L571】
- **USB-C floodlight banks.** Commuters are trialling 3,000–9,000 lm rechargeable headlights that double as power banks and pair them with programmable LED tails or mirror-mounted 12 V lamps for better cutoff control than stock scooter beams.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L47-L48】

## Commissioning Checklist
- Meter throttle outputs with the controller unpowered and confirm signal stays ≤3.3 V at full travel.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L503-L505】
- Before flashing or editing parameters, follow the VESC Tool workflow—**Read → edit → Write**—and explicitly hit **Write Motor/App Config** after each wizard so Xiaomi throttles and ADC settings persist across power cycles instead of forcing full detections at the next boot.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L542-L544】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part005_review.md†L410-L413】
- Log live current on accessory rails during first rides to validate that horns, lights, and pumps stay within regulator capacity; retune battery current if accessories share pack headroom with the controller.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L400-L401】
- After harness work, perform continuity checks on 12 V outputs and confirm no sensor grounds are floating before closing the deck.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L547-L547】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L368-L368】

## Outstanding Documentation Needs
1. Publish a formal power-sequencing diagram for Flipsky and SimpleVescDisplay installs on Spintend/MakerBase hardware, including connector pinouts and ground references.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L366-L368】
2. Capture tested fuse ratings and wire gauges for external 12 V bucks powering horns, lights, and air compressors so builders can size safety hardware confidently.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L400-L401】
3. Verify whether Spintend’s Spinny/ADC v2 harness can safely source dual-function tail/brake lights or if relays are required, then publish the findings alongside rail current measurements.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L430-L431】【F:knowledge/notes/input_part013_review.md†L548-L548】
