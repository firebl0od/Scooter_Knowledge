# Battery Pack Design

## Overview

Designing custom battery packs for electric scooters requires careful cell selection, capacity planning, and understanding of chemistry limitations. This guide covers field-tested strategies for choosing cells, sizing parallel groups, managing thermal stress, and avoiding common failure modes. Whether building a commuter pack or a high-performance setup, these insights will help you create reliable, long-lasting battery systems.

## What You'll Learn

- Cell selection criteria (chemistry, discharge ratings, sourcing)
- Capacity planning for different use cases and power levels
- Parallel and series configuration strategies
- BMS selection and thermal management
- Cost-effective sourcing and avoiding counterfeit cells
- Chemistry-specific guardrails (Samsung, Molicel, LG, etc.)
- Pack longevity and maintenance considerations

## 📋 Quick Reference: Cell Selection by Use Case

| Application | Recommended Cells | Typical Config | Key Reason |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|------------|
| Long-range commuter | Samsung 35E, LG MH1 | 16S 6-7P | Cost-effective, good range |
| High-discharge sport | Molicel P42A, P45B | 20S 5-6P | 35-40A per cell capability |
| Budget performance | Samsung 50S, LG M50LT | 16S 5-6P | Balance of cost and performance |
| Premium long-range | Samsung 50E | 20S 7-8P | High capacity, moderate discharge |

## ⚠️ Critical Design Principles

🔴 **Cell Matching**: Sort cells by internal resistance (<5mΩ spread)
⚡ **Voltage Limits**: Never exceed chemistry maximums (4.2V for most Li-ion)
🔧 **Busbar Sizing**: 0.15mm nickel minimum, copper for >70A per strip
📝 **BMS Rating**: Must exceed peak discharge + regen current

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Start conservative**: Easier to upgrade pack than replace burned cells
- **Test before building**: Verify cell IR and capacity on samples
- **Plan for expansion**: Leave room for future voltage/capacity upgrades
- **Document everything**: Take photos at each assembly stage

## Cell Selection Strategies

- Builders are migrating from Samsung 40T 15 S 6 P packs to denser 15 S 10 P VTC6 or pending Samsung 50S cells to curb voltage sag, accepting higher per-cell costs for improved current handling.[^pack_cells]
- Abuse testing on recycled 250 W hub motors with 84 V/2 000 W inputs demagnetised rotors past ~80 °C, so builders now favour fresh Samsung 35E/50S/48X cells or 21700 formats when repacking Xiaomi decks to keep thermal headroom and energy density balanced.[^cell_refresh]
- Mirono’s teardown of Vsett-sourced packs shows DynaVolt-built 14 S 6 P modules with BAK 2 600 mAh cells staying near ambient at ~30 A (≈2.3 C); they are viable donor bricks so long as the original BMS current limits remain in place.[^1]
- NKON-sourced EVE and BAK cells continue to meet spec for budget packs, whereas random AliExpress batteries or mystery LG bundles often arrive damaged or underperform—stick with reputable builders even if prices climb.[^denis-cell-vetting]
- High-current discharge tests demand Kelvin (four-wire) probing.
  - thin alligator clips dropped a healthy P42A to a false 1.9 V at 20 A until the team clamped directly to the tabs
  - so upgrade leads and meters before condemning cells.[^2]
- EU comparison logs now peg P42A as the 20–30 A workhorse, LG/Samsung 50G as the 7–10 A efficiency pick, and Samsung 50S/Vapcell T50 matching P42A output only if you can justify roughly double the price; community bulk buys land 30T/35E/50G cells near €2.5–€4 each.[^3]
- Inspect Samsung 35E/40T lots for leftover weld marks before buying; “used but tested” batches keep circulating at €2.5–€3 per cell and veterans reject them outright.[^cell_vigilance]
- 50E packs with cooling can still deliver high energy at ~15 A per cell, but Raphael warns they require stricter protection than typical scooter BMS gear compared with 40T builds.[^50e_protection]
- Samsung 48X packs shine in 8 P commuters pulling ≤60 A total—they hold similar sag to P42A at 10 A per cell while adding ~20 % usable energy, but builders still pick 40T/P42A when each cell must deliver ≥15 A.[^ip001-48x]
- LG M50LT curves now rival Samsung 48X at 10 A and stay strong at 15 A with ~4.2 Ah down to 3.0 V; just meter internal resistance because Tesla surplus lots on AliExpress arrive as lower-grade bins.[^ip001-m50lt]
- Riders eyeing 14 S3 P or 22 S11 P layouts praise Molicel P50B’s 50 A capability but note limited supply (~€7.95 per cell via NKON plus ≈US$80 shipping), making Samsung 50S or Bak 45D the pragmatic alternatives.[^p50b-market]
- Artem still leans on P42A-class cells for ~25 A-per-cell builds, calls Samsung 48X only a modest upgrade over 50G, and highlights Samsung M50LT Gen 2 for 0–15 A commuter packs while the crew chases scarce 50E/Molicel stock around Europe.[^cell_availability]

## Capacity Planning & Chemistry Guardrails

- Mirono’s 13 S 5 P NCR21700A pack starts at 50 A battery current and caps around 75 A so the ≈15 A-per-cell string stays inside spec.
  - use the same discipline whenever you squeeze high-capacity cells into 5 P commuters.[^4]
- Thunder-frame conversions are now targeting 22 S 11 P packs with full BMS integration; lighter riders can drop to 22 S 10 P on next-gen 40PL cells if they prioritise weight savings over maximum range.[^thunder-22s]
- A 20 S9 P Samsung 48X pack lands around $5.75 per cell delivered from Canada, supports ≈150 A bursts (~17 A per cell), and yields roughly 40–80 mile range depending on riding style.[^pack_48x]
- AWD conversions should run a single motor until a 16 S 5–7 P (or internal/external hybrid) battery is ready; 12 S 3 P packs sag or overheat on VESC hardware even when the controller can deliver the amps.[^5]
- Mixed MJ1/MH1 parallels sag 10–12 V at ≈9 A per cell; veterans cap both chemistries near 7 A and pivot to Samsung 50G, Molicel P42A, or Murata VTC6 for higher-current builds instead of chasing firmware fixes.[^6]
- Repeated BMS thermal trips permanently raise cell resistance—schedule monthly IR checks and dial charge current back when Daly-class boards run near their limit.[^ip001-bmsheat]
- A single overcharge to ~4.61 V/cell slashed a 13 S pack’s life to roughly 250 cycles; treat 100 % cutoffs as a hard ceiling and meter chargers after firmware updates.[^ip001-overcharge]
- Kukirin G2 Master owners are stepping up to 16 S packs built from Samsung 50S/E or EVE 40PL cells before swapping controllers, confirming that high-discharge cells and a moderate voltage bump deliver tangible speed gains without overstressing the chassis.[^kukirin-16s]
- Yamal is dailying Samsung 40T cells in a 20 S 10 P layout (≈35 A nominal per cell) and reminded builders that LR2170LA “45 A” Lishens only hold that rating briefly—cross-check real discharge tests before promising 300 A builds.[^yamal-40t]
- Ausias plans to sell his 20 S 10 P P45B Nami pack to step into a 22 S 11 P layout, while peers debate stacking extra parallels above the battery box—log packaging constraints before you commit to 450 A-capable packs inside the deck.[^ausias-22s]
- Xiaomi Pro 2 owners now favour swapping the stock BMS 126 for BMS 128 boards because the higher-capacity factory pack tracks more closely with the updated hardware.[^bms128_upgrade]
- AWD conversions should run a single motor until a 16 S 5–7 P (or internal/external hybrid) battery is ready; 12 S 3 P packs sag or overheat on VESC hardware even when the controller can deliver the amps.[^5]
- Mixed MJ1/MH1 parallels sag 10–12 V at ≈9 A per cell; veterans cap both chemistries near 7 A and pivot to Samsung 50G, Molicel P42A, or Murata VTC6 for higher-current builds instead of chasing firmware fixes.[^6]
- Denis still steers newcomers toward 12 S externals because 13 S+ packs demand reinforced controllers (heavier capacitors, IRFB4110 MOSFETs, beefed-up traces) and resistor swaps such as ≈28 kΩ/130 kΩ for 13 S, ≈30 kΩ/140 kΩ for 14 S, and ≈33 kΩ/150 kΩ for 15 S dividers.[^12s_guardrails]
- Even when externals mirror stock voltage, keep their BMS inline—Rita riders who bypassed protection cooked packs early, and dual 48 V setups only charge safely when both boards share a common port tied into the scooter’s inlet.[^externals_need_bms]
- Stock Pro 2 controllers on 12 S builds stay reliable when battery current tops out near 27 A; pushing closer to 30 A invites thermal runaway unless the board is reinforced.[^pro2_27a_limit]
- Expect winter range hits: riders logged roughly half their normal mileage on 10 S 3 P packs at 4 °C even though torque felt similar, so plan larger externals or gentler power use for cold commutes.[^cold_weather_range]
- Parallel externals of similar size (e.g., 14 S4 P + 14 S3 P) still track evenly—Rita’s state-of-charge estimate remained accurate when the packs shared voltage and chemistry.[^parallel_soc]
- Treat 12 S 3 P auxiliaries as emergency range only; workshop logs show they choke aggressive tunes that stay lively with 13 S 5 P internals or 13 S 6 P conversions, and Essential-class BMS boards still cap output near 400 W until upgraded.[^12s3p_small]
- When budgeting BMS current, remember XiaoGen’s 30 A controller ceiling equates to ≈20 A battery draw on 36 V externals, so dual 20 A common-port boards cover ~900 W without drifting cell balance—larger packs need parallel groups sized alike to prevent sag complaints.[^dual20a_bms]
- Budget Liitokala LiFePO₄ cells arrive unbalanced, sag heavily above ≈12 A, and often ship slowly by boat.
  - reserve them for stationary projects unless you can package much larger scooter enclosures.[^7]
- Paolo’s turnkey 20 S 6 P P45B pack (full-copper busbars, 425 A ANT BMS, dual QS8s, 7 AWG leads) lands near €650, providing a price-to-spec baseline when weighing DIY versus boutique high-current batteries.[^p45b-benchmark]
- Long-range planners are sketching 60–70 Ah “legal chassis” scooters with ruggedised enclosures and fast-charge capability so mixed dirt/pavement tours stay compliant—evidence that endurance-focused VESC pack guides need as much attention as sprint builds.[^legal-chassis]
- Builders debating 50 PL tabless upgrades versus cheaper 50E/50S strings report WePoor decks max near 20 S 12 P unless you mill the top rail, setting realistic capacity ceilings for those frames.[^50pl-vs-50e]
- High-current race packs now treat ~40 A per P45B as acceptable when cooling is dialled: skrtt’s 18 S 9 P plan for 350 A drew green lights so long as logging confirmed sag and phase limits—not pack voltage—were the real bottleneck.[^p45b_current]
- Lipoly pouch packs promise huge C-rates but force builders to break series links for charging because hobby chargers top out around 6–7 S; even with a BMS, puncture risk keeps 20 kg RC packs a niche pick compared with cylindrical Li-ion or LiFePO₄ bricks.[^lipoly_tradeoffs]
- LiFePO₄ remains attractive for crash resilience on motorcycle-scale builds, yet riders still weigh Wh/L penalties against Samsung 48X-class Li-ion cells before committing to the chemistry.[^lifepo_tradeoffs]
- Denis equates a 13 S 6 P stack of 2 500 mAh cells to roughly 20 Ah at 10 S, giving Pro-class decks about double the stock range so long as you respect Rita’s 5 A shared charging limit.[^denis-13s6p-pack]
- Budget Liitokala LiFePO₄ cells arrive unbalanced, sag heavily above ≈12 A, and often ship slowly by boat.
  - reserve them for stationary projects unless you can package much larger scooter enclosures.[^7]
- Lithium fires are effectively self-sustaining, so crews only trust water for cooling nearby equipment; where packaging allows, they spec LiFePO₄ blocks to tame thermal runaway risk despite the weight penalty.[^denis-fire]

## Booster & Repair Safeguards (Denis Part 02, Lines 15 001–16 500)

- Extending Xiaomi internals with 2S2P “booster” bricks only works when the add-on carries its own BMS and dedicated charge plug—never backfeed the stock harness.[^booster-bms]
- Don’t tack spare cells across finished packs: Denis only tolerates soldering after you rebuild each parallel group properly, otherwise the sub-pack stays unprotected and charges awkwardly.[^solder-parallel]
- Retire recycled laptop cells from traction duty; stick with fresh high-discharge parts such as EVE INR18650-26V sourced from NKON or similar vetted vendors.[^fresh-cells]
- The Rita BMS Tool’s amp-hour fields are cosmetic; only the series configuration changes scooter behavior, so mis-entered capacity values won’t fix range math.[^rita-capacity]
- Cheap handheld spot welders still struggle with EV-grade interconnects—budget for K-weld-class tools if you expect durable joints, especially when stepping up to 21700 builds.[^welder-upgrade]
- Portable capacitor welders behave far better when you shorten the leads, reinforce high-current traces, and feed them with ≥180 C LiPo packs while keeping pulses at or below ~30 J; overshooting toward 50 J on soft 80 C bricks scorches 0.1–0.15 mm nickel and overheats MOSFETs.[^portable-welder-tuning]

## Layout and Interconnects

- Proposed geometries include 16 S 7 P and 12 S 9 P assemblies that rely on wider nickel strips and copper busbar "sandwich" welds to sustain 70–80 A continuous discharge without overheating.[^pack_layout]
- PuneDir’s 16 S 7 P Molicel M26 retrofit proved 13 S commuter frames can swallow 60 V packs when you match chargers to pack voltage instead of forcing higher-voltage supplies to sag.[^punedir-16s]
- Community connector tables drive upgrades from stock 10–12 AWG leads to heavier wiring and lower-resistance plugs (XT60/90/150, EC5) on Ubox builds.[^pack_connectors]
- MP2-based 22S2P (~650 Wh) cores drop straight into compact frames, and builders are stacking six more cells under the ESC to reach 24S while preserving regen space inside the deck.[^mp2-22s]
- Packing experts now double-layer shrink (mixing lighter “Albert” sleeves with thicker “Denis” stock) and add intermediate padding so balance leads don’t chafe in transit; shrink damage usually signals loose clamping rather than weak material.[^double_shrink][^pack_clamp]
- Tudor’s latest measurements confirm a Xiaomi Pro deck accepts 13 S5 P 18650 packs without relocating electronics, while 13 S7 P or 12 S4 P 21700 layouts typically need 20–25 mm deck extensions to clear the shell.[^tudor_deck_maps]
- Square 10S3P bricks slip into 2 L cases while 10S4P packs demand honeycomb spacing; reuse OEM spacers only when you add ≥8 mm multi-path nickel links so every cell has its own series bridge.[^denis-10s-spacing]
- Route balance leads along the pack underside, keep harness lengths within ~50 % of each other, and solder power leads across the full nickel bus so load spreads evenly instead of concentrating on a single strip.[^denis-balance-routing]
- Ninebot Max and Xiaomi Pro deck extensions can accommodate up to 16 S 5 P 21700 modules with ~27 mm spacers, though installers often trim or rotate controller housings to keep packaging tidy.[^deck_extension]
- Stock G30 frames already hide 20 S 6 P packs internally, but stretching to 20 S 9 P by machining deck rails and deleting the OEM ESC introduces convoluted busbars and structural compromises—seasoned builders steer first-timers toward simple rectangular stacks instead of chasing every last cell.[^g30-20s9p]
- Backpack commuters still squeeze folded 20 S4 P modules into stripped 5 L packs, but aluminium quick-release racks need reinforcement before they can safely haul the extra mass.[^backpack-20s]
- Tudor’s PETG honeycomb holders and interlocking connectors let Xiaomi and G30 packs dry-fit without glue, while other builders laser-cut 3–6 mm kraftplex skeletons, wrap them in thin PETG jackets, and still tape the stack with fish paper because sealed decks trap heat regardless of insulation choices.[^petg_honeycomb]
- Document hot-glue beads, silicone ribs, and honeycomb spacers against 80 °C ovens and vibration rigs so retention guides can name which combinations actually survive dense commuter packs without letting cells drift.[^retention_testing]
- Recycling pledges are nudging EU pack shops toward kraftplex or other recyclable wraps, yet fish-paper rolls are scarce enough that crews are prototyping 0.8 mm kraftplex jackets while still insisting on series separators to prevent can-to-can shorts.[^8]
- Koxx’s 14 S 6 P build uses RePackr-balanced groups, glued cells, and glass-fibre spacers between layers to equalise resistance across parallels inside cramped decks.
  - mirror the approach when you need uniform discharge in tight enclosures.[^9]
- Xiaomi and Ninebot decks swallow 12 S 4 P–5 P 21700 packs if you stand the cells vertically, add deck spacers, wrap every edge in fish paper, and insulate the tray so the aluminium shell cannot abrade nickel; even sub-millimetre gaps around magnets become failure points without that prep.[^10]
- Xiaomi Pro frames will even accept 15 S 4 P 21700 bricks (16 S 4 P is the realistic ceiling) when you chase high-voltage internals; favour high-discharge cells such as Samsung 50E/40T, Molicel P42A, or Sony VTC6A to keep sag in check on aggressive tunes.[^denis-21700-fit]
- EU builders are struggling to source sub-kilogram lots of 21700 honeycomb nickel, so crews now pool half-kilo group buys or pay ~€40 to EU suppliers rather than wait for AliExpress consolidation when deadlines loom.[^11]
- Mirono refuses to assemble small packs without rigid holders or honeycomb cages, pairing the structure with rubber liners whenever Xiaomi frame rails are sanded so 12 S 4 P packs and controller looms can share the tray without chafing.[^12]
- Denis measured that a Xiaomi Pro deck comfortably houses 12 S4 P (48 cells), squeezes 13 S4 P with tight tolerances, and picks up space for roughly 17 extra 21700s (≈13 S5 P) once a 2 cm spacer is added—nearly matching 33 Ah 10 S packs without sacrificing deck integrity.[^pro_deck_capacity]
- Copper “sandwich” busbars (0.1 mm copper capped with nickel) paired with 0.1 mm pure copper links now anchor 120 A BMS builds, proving the laminate holds up when riders document weld energy and clamp pressure.[^copper_sandwich]
- Honeycomb layouts that funnel a whole 5 P group through a single 8 mm nickel strip have already bottlenecked current.
  - rebuild with sheet bussing or at least five 7–8 mm straps in parallel (0.25–0.30 mm thick) so each bridge carries ≥35–40 A without hot spots before scaling voltage or series count.[^13]
- For longevity, cycle scooter packs between roughly 20 % and 85 % (≈3.6–4.1 V/cell), keep pack temps under 40–45 °C, and cap sag near 10 %—letting cells drop below 2.8 V or hit 70 °C drives capacity toward ~400 cycles.[^ip001-window]
- Xiaomi Pro 2 conversions max out around 20 S 2 P (40 cells) once spacer thickness and rail clearance are counted unless you sand PETG carriers or plan external enclosures.[^gabe-20s]
- Rental G30 conversions swallow "thick" 13 S 5 P 21700 packs once the spacer grows the cavity to ≈155 mm × 400 mm, but EU builders struggle to source 220 mm shrink locally.
  - plan packaging and consumables early for long-range decks.[^14]
- Down-populating a 30 S ANT smart BMS to a 22 S harness without revising the pinout causes the board to misreport cell voltages, so map sense leads carefully before trimming balance looms.[^ant_downpop]
- Ninebot G30 6 P conversions need deck-rail trimming, custom assembly jigs, and capable soldering gear before you outgrow the stock pack—budget the tooling overhead before promising larger parallels.[^g30-rail]
- Hobby spot welders handle pure copper busbars up to roughly 0.15 mm consistently; 0.2 mm strips already push their limits, so plan industrial tooling if you want thicker copper laminates.[^copper-weld-limit]
- LiquorHole’s Yisuntrek R8 runs a 100 Ah CATL prismatic pack (~25 kW) inside a 26 × 14 in deck; after a frame failure the electronics survived, highlighting that the chassis becomes the consumable on heavyweight commuters.[^yisuntrek-pack]
- Stock Nami Burn-E packs remain 20 S 10 P bricks that tightly fill the plastic enclosure with straight rows, leaving little slack for retrofits.[^burne-pack]
- Artem squeezed a 60 V 30 Ah 21700 pack into a Vsett 9 by interlocking dual 5 mm aluminium rods and tuning PETG prints to ±0.05 mm on circular features so the mass stays centred.[^vsett9_pack]
- Smooth PEI beds grip PETG too aggressively; bump the Z offset by ≈0.1 mm or print on glass, textured PEI, FR4, or glue-stick layers to save the coating when turning out enclosure parts.[^petg_bed]
- Vsett deck rails must come out entirely to fit longer replacement packs—trimming cells to nestle in the stock channels is off the table.[^vsett_rails]
- Crimp or solder external-pack leads decisively, tighten XT30/phase connectors, and refresh controller thermal interfaces with paste or insulating pads so connector shells stay below ≈60 °C when dual packs share current.[^xt30_prep]
- Wildman 2 L bags still demand airflow: builders laser-cut angled PETG cages and slip-in separators so 10 S–13 S bricks breathe and avoid hot spots even when space is tight.[^wildman_cages]
- Equal-length nickel links alone do not balance 13 S stacks—follow Micah Toll’s series routing diagrams and confirm weld quality to spread current evenly across parallels.[^equal_length_myth]
- High-capacity builds expose tradeoffs: 12 S 9 P 21700 packs sag like compact 13 S 3 P arrays, Wildman 3 L bags accept dense sideways PCB layouts, and Essential-class scooters tuned for 30 km/h at 100 kg still realise only 8–10 km of usable range.[^large_pack_tradeoffs]
- Secure heavy frame bags mechanically—triangle bags bolted with U-bolts and internal plates hold massive packs steadier than 3D-printed brackets alone.[^bag_mounting]
- Denis, Hero, and Rumi are prototyping rigid external cases while others test riveted aluminium shells as theft-resistant alternatives to Wildman pouches—treat metal bag concepts as in-progress until durability testing lands.[^denis-metal-bag]
- Even copper-sandwiched 20S10P builds demand robust fusing and monitoring—Paolo’s Murata packs can still light off if an ESC faults and shorts the bus, so treat protection hardware as mandatory, not optional.[^denis-paolo-fuse]
- Rental G30 conversions swallow "thick" 13 S 5 P 21700 packs once the spacer grows the cavity to ≈155 mm × 400 mm, but EU builders struggle to source 220 mm shrink locally.
  - plan packaging and consumables early for long-range decks.[^14]
- Battery refurbishers now glue reclaimed cells into rigid cages with Gorilla or Sikaflex-class adhesives instead of relying on bare Kapton, pairing the structure with individual cell testing so vibration does not tear packs apart mid-ride.[^adhesive-cages]

## Testing & Service Notes

- Serious pack testing now leans on iCharger 4010 Duos or DIY 400 W–1 kW resistor banks built into miner chassis so builders can log charge/discharge curves before the pack hits the road.[^15]
- Acetone remains the go-to solvent for peeling stubborn double-sided tape between LiPo bricks before repurposing them as spot-welder supplies.
  - ventilate the workspace and stage absorbent pads before bathing the cells.[^16]
- Xiaomi’s stock GX16-3 inlet is happiest around 3 A because the internal JST pigtail overheats; parallel pins on a GX16-4 for 6–8 A service or swap to XT30 leads with 16–18 AWG silicone wire to keep resistance and heat under control.[^17]
- Inmotion LF8 rental packs expose B+/B− pads under silicone-potted BMS boards.
  - bypassers now solder straight to the nickel busbars but stress that unsupervised discharge or secondary-BMS deletes are a fire risk.[^18]
- Treat punctured or weather-soaked cells as total losses: JPPL discovered three damaged P45B cans after soldering copper busbars on a rain-exposed scooter, and peers pushed for a full rebuild with fresh insulation and sealing before trusting 400 A packs outdoors.[^punctured_cells]
- EU pack shops increasingly rely on peer networks to secure leaded solder when retailers run dry—PaoloWu’s spare spool kept GABE’s builds moving—so budget community trades or stockpile consumables ahead of deadlines.[^eu_solder]
- Face de Pin Sucé’s 16 S 10 P P42A pack tolerated 47 A fast charging once paired with an external power stage and active cooling, setting a benchmark for pit-charge workflows on high-capacity builds.[^19]
- Mattia’s booster pack refused to wake after two idle weeks until AG.racing found a broken balance lead—add balance-wire inspections to your diagnostic checklist before condemning the BMS.[^booster-balance]
- Artem’s latest 14 S pack stacks dual 3 mm copper busbars, layered insulation, and remote BMS wiring that demands a 5 V pre-charge before plugging in the balance loom.
  - document that activation sequence before shipping SIM-enabled boards to customers.[^20]
- Range logs from 12 S 4 P P42A packs show 15–20 km of aggressive riding consuming ~40 % capacity with 40 A battery / 80 A phase peaks, underscoring how lower-voltage Wheelway hubs heat quickly without thermistors or active cooling.[^21]
- LiquorHole is upsizing the ANT BMS on that 100 Ah pack from 325 A to 425 A after logging 270 A, 20 S bursts and now runs 20 A fast charging through XT60 leads (25 A max), trimming full cycles to ~5 h—use similar upgrades when prismatic packs outgrow their charge hardware.[^ant-upgrade]
- Pairing a 10 S4 P 21700 internal with Denis’ external range pack already yields ~65 km at 20 km/h on flat ground, with projections near 85 km once the higher-capacity core is welded.[^hybrid_range]
- Treat miracle “48 V 99 999 mAh” externals as fire risks—experienced builders report reputable packs of the same size barely hit 15–20 Ah, and Denis will not warranty Rita installs fed by those claims.[^suspicious_48v_claim]
- Samsung-based packs should avoid charging below 0 °C; gentle 20 km/h cruising barely warms the cells, so limit regen and heavy draws until the pack self-heats.[^cold_charge_guardrail]
- Low-power heater pads (≈5 V/10 W) barely raise pack temperature unless heavily insulated, prompting some riders to pull 30–40 A briefly—while respecting Rita’s ≈30 A ceiling—to warm cells before fast riding.[^heater_pad_limit]
- LiPo bricks can run through Rita but only with protective BMS boards and strict current limits; the adapter’s 40 A fuse and the chemistry’s violent venting make reputable 18650s the safer daily choice.[^lipo_guardrail]
- Quality 13 S 9 P internal packs have returned ~35 km with over half the battery remaining, while Rita plus Aerdu 10 S 14 Ah externals delivered 82 km by daisy-chaining spares.[^range_case]
- Investigate charge complaints at the harness first: reversed-polarity aftermarket ports and loose connectors have mimicked dead chargers until riders swapped back to genuine Xiaomi jacks.[^charge_port_faults]
- Treat BMS LEDs as first-line diagnostics—steady red lights and loose sense wires explain “won’t charge” cases even when the scooter still rides.[^bms_led_triage]
- Inspect welds on every module; six-spot patterns that penetrate both nickel faces survive road vibration better than sparse welds on external packs.[^six_spot_weld]
- Keep parallels within ≈0.03 V during assembly and re-check after a few cycles so the BMS does not burn extra capacity rebalancing the stack.[^prebalance_003v]
- Extending Xiaomi decks for 16 S–20 S blocks leaves little ground clearance—16 S 6 P bricks hang centimetres below the shell and 20 S builds require raised decks or external enclosures.[^16s6p_clearance]
- Spot-clean benches while welding: the crew traced a late-night pack fire to stray solder balls bridging Chinese 18650 cans, reinforcing the need for clean work surfaces, sand buckets, and extinguisher access.[^bench_fire]
