# Accessory and UX Planning

## Display and Dashboard Options

- VESC lacks a built-in dashboard, so riders rely on the mobile app or third-party TFT units, although the stock screen is viewed as bulky and unattractive.[^dashboard_gap]
- Off-the-shelf TFTs can be zip-tied onto OEM dashboards or replaced entirely with phone mounts; some builders pursue 3D-printed housings and auxiliary handlebars for sturdier accessory mounting.[^tft_mounts]
- Comparative testing spans Davega X, Eye3-compatible ESP32 displays, and Flipsky TFT modules, with stealth installs that reuse factory casings to stay compliant with local regulations.[^display_comparison]
- Smart dashboard wishlists include ESP32 logic for mode toggles, legal-speed presets triggered by button combinations, and selecting CAN over UART to survive high-current noise environments.[^smart_dash_roadmap]

## Lighting Upgrades

- Riders trial 3 000–9 000 lm USB-C headlights that double as power banks, programmable LED tail lights, and 12 V mirror-mounted assemblies to overcome weak, glare-prone stock Xiaomi lamps.[^lighting_tests]

## Power Control Ergonomics

- The platform supports sleep mode, but implementing a physical power switch requires custom wiring; many builds still rely on anti-spark switches as manual cut-offs.[^sleep_wiring]

## Protective Gear & Comfort

- High-speed commuters treat full-face helmets and winter balaclavas as consumables—budget at least $120 for a quality lid and keep it on indoors when shuttling between shops to deter theft and stay warm in −15 °C conditions.[^winter-helmets]
