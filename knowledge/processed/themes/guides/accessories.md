# Accessory and UX Planning

## Display and Dashboard Options

- VESC lacks a built-in dashboard, so riders rely on the mobile app or third-party TFT units, although the stock screen is viewed as bulky and unattractive.[^dashboard_gap]
- Off-the-shelf TFTs can be zip-tied onto OEM dashboards or replaced entirely with phone mounts; some builders pursue 3D-printed housings and auxiliary handlebars for sturdier accessory mounting.[^tft_mounts]
- Comparative testing spans Davega X, Eye3-compatible ESP32 displays, and Flipsky TFT modules, with stealth installs that reuse factory casings to stay compliant with local regulations.[^display_comparison]
- Smart dashboard wishlists include ESP32 logic for mode toggles, legal-speed presets triggered by button combinations, and selecting CAN over UART to survive high-current noise environments.[^smart_dash_roadmap]
- Minimotors EY3 displays still require a VSETT Lisp bridge when paired with Flipsky FT85BD or Ubox Lite clones; leaving the bridge’s throttle-out lead disconnected has already bricked retrofits, so treat the passthrough as mandatory wiring.[^ey3_bridge]
- Builders without CAN accessories lean on $10 USB GPS speedometers that boot in under a minute from a 5 V feed, offering a simple overlay when TFT dashboards will not fit the cockpit.[^usb_gps]

## Accessory Power Planning

- High-voltage scooters power lighting and telemetry through wide-input (≈9–120 V) buck modules stepped down to 5 V at 2–3 A, but veterans now bench-test every unit: mislabeled boards have overvolted 6 V lamps, standby draw needs confirmation against the advertised ≈1 mA, and the VESC ADC daughterboard remains an analog interface rather than a substitute step-down supply.[^hv_buck]

## Media Capture & Logging

- Insta360 cameras still provide native GPS overlays, whereas GoPro’s Hero 12 dropped the feature, so riders chasing on-screen speed data favour Insta360 hardware for documentation runs.[^insta360]

## Lighting Upgrades

- Riders trial 3 000–9 000 lm USB-C headlights that double as power banks, programmable LED tail lights, and 12 V mirror-mounted assemblies to overcome weak, glare-prone stock Xiaomi lamps.[^lighting_tests]
- When pack marketing claims prove inflated, commuters repack MagicShine-style lights with quality 18650/21700 cells or jump to budget 5×P90 AliExpress headlights so night rides aren’t riding on dying “10 000 mAh” packs.[^magicshine_repack]
- Compact, E-marked motorcycle turn signals from AliExpress pair cleanly with dedicated DC-DC converters when you need discreet road-legal flashers on scooter builds.[^emark_signals]
- 🇪🇸AYO#74’s parts list now includes low-cost motorcycle brake lights, waterproof COB strips, and inline three-button dimmers that drop straight onto 12 V rails or reducers for custom lighting suites.[^ayo_lighting]

## Power Control Ergonomics

- The platform supports sleep mode, but implementing a physical power switch requires custom wiring; many builds still rely on anti-spark switches as manual cut-offs.[^sleep_wiring]
- Riders chasing premium switchgear are adopting Tusk’s Compact Control Switch for lighting and horn duties because it survives vibration better than generic scooter pods.[^tusk_switch]

## Protective Gear & Comfort

- High-speed commuters treat full-face helmets and winter balaclavas as consumables—budget at least $120 for a quality lid and keep it on indoors when shuttling between shops to deter theft and stay warm in −15 °C conditions.[^winter-helmets]
