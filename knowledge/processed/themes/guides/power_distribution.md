## Cable Management Fundamentals

### Voltage Drop Issues

**Long Cable Runs**:[^long_leads]
- 16 AWG leads with XT30 connectors caused ~0.5V per-cell drops at 40A
- Occurred on 12S7P pack
- **Solutions**:
  - Shorten cable runs
  - Upgrade to XT60/XT90 connectors
  - Use 10-12 AWG wiring
  - Markedly improves voltage sag

### EMI Reduction

**Cable Routing Strategy**:[^emi_routing]
- Route high-current cables on one side of deck
- Route signal/brake harnesses on opposite side
- Reduces electromagnetic interference
- Especially important in tight Vsett installations
- Upsize connectors to reduce resistance

### Securing Cables

**Metal Zip Ties**:[^metal_zipties]
- Stainless "metal zip ties" stay flexible in cold
- Secure battery looms without hose clamp bulk
- Plastic ties crack in winter storage
- Good for garage-stored scooters

> **üí° Pro Tip**: Plan cable routing before final assembly. Separating power and signal cables prevents many EMI-related issues.

## Cable Gauge Selection

### Current Capacity Guidelines

**AWG vs Current Ratings**:

| Gauge | Continuous Current | Burst Current | Typical Use |
|-------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| 16 AWG | ~15A | ~25A | Low-power accessories |
| 12 AWG | ~35A | ~55A | Medium power, short runs |
| 10 AWG | ~55A | ~85A | 60A continuous applications |
| 8 AWG | ~75A | ~115A | High power, dual feeds |
| 6 AWG | ~100A | ~150A | Very high current mains |

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning**: These ratings assume good cooling and short runs. Enclosed cables or long runs require derating.

### Specific Applications
