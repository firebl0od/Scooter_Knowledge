# Power Distribution and Wiring Hygiene

## Cable Management

- Long 16 AWG leads paired with XT30 connectors caused ~0.5 V per-cell drops at 40 A on a 12 S 7 P pack; shortening runs, upgrading to XT60/XT90, and using 10–12 AWG wiring markedly improves voltage sag.[^long_leads]
- Routing high-current cabling on one deck side and signal/brake harnesses on the other reduces EMI in tight Vsett installations, especially once connectors are upsized.[^emi_routing]
- Stainless “metal zip ties” stay flexible in cold garages and secure battery looms without the bulk of hose clamps—handy when plastic ties crack in winter storage.[^metal_zipties]

## Signal Filtering & Parallel Pack Discipline

- For throttle-signal filtering, the crew scavenges ~100 nF ceramic capacitors from dead electronics instead of grafting oversized drone caps; always discharge and meter salvaged parts before bridging signal-to-ground so you know the exact capacitance you are adding.[^ceramic_scavenge]
- When paralleling 16 S packs, tie all grounds together, match series counts and capacities, pre-balance voltages, and watch for cross-charging so the smaller pack is not over-stressed despite individual BMS protection.[^parallel_rules]

## High-Current Harness Upgrades

- External battery riders are graduating to 4 mm gold bullets, AS120 mains, and even direct-soldered phase leads after discovering stock 2 mm conductors and MR60 plugs overheat above ~80–100 A; backpack packs stay cool once the heavier hardware is in place.[^1]
- For 90 A packs, default to AWG10 main leads (or dual AWG12 runs) and consider 3–3.5 mm solid-core copper between pack negatives and BMS plates for roughly 40 % more ampacity.
  - as long as the runs stay short.[^2]
- 12 AWG phase leads remain comfortable around 100 A continuous, yet light riders have logged 150 A bursts on 13 S hubs with post-ride temps near 45 °C.
  - plan short duty cycles or forced cooling if you intend to exceed the published ampacity.[^3]
- Community Amass connector testing now pegs 10 AWG as the practical minimum for 60 A continuous, with AS120 shells running cooler than AS150 in scooter-duty cycles thanks to their contact geometry.
  - size wiring and connectors accordingly before chasing 70 A+ battery limits.[^4]
- Heavy 90–150 A phase runs are shifting toward XT150 bullets or AS150U anti-spark leads.
  - roughly 0.20 mΩ resistance and spare signal pins
  - so controllers can feed trackers or smart BMS links without extra connectors while keeping voltage drop minimal.[^5]
- Jason still specs XT150 bullets on motor phases while leaving XT90s on the battery feed, and `lekrsu` reminds builders that MT60 plugs bundle three XT60-style bullets for tidy triple-phase hookups.[^xt150-guidance]
- Treat solder as mechanical filler, not the conductor: twist or fold AWG12 leads to double their contact area before wetting bullets, because even silver-bearing solder conducts two to five times worse than copper.[^6]
- Builders graduating dual VESC setups beyond 150 A phase are standardising on Amass AS150U anti-spark pairs with 8 AWG tails and XT150/AS150 mains once burst logs show 500 A phase.
  - XT90s are now treated as temporary jumpers to avoid the 200–300 A desoldering failures others recorded.[^7]
- Wolf-class hubs ship with roughly 4 mm (≈AWG 11–12) phase leads that tolerate about 130 A once properly cooled; measure the copper cross-section and frame clearance before ordering 11-inch wheel kits or drilling axles for thicker wiring.[^wolf-phase]
- Genuine Amass 8 mm bullets clamp dual 10 AWG phases far tighter than generic 8 mm copies; expect to hand-fit or even shave 10 mm bullets if you mix brands on high-current leads, and budget space for 10 mm hardware when controllers ship with doubled 10 AWG phase tails.[^amass-fit]
