# Processed Knowledge Themes

This directory promotes recurring insights from the Telegram review notes into shareable references.
Content is grouped by theme so future editors can expand each area without rereading raw transcripts.

- `themes/brands/` – vendor- or product-specific dossiers covering strengths, weaknesses, and purchasing tips.
- `themes/guides/` – how-to references for setup, tuning, troubleshooting, and safety practices.

### Editorial Expectations
- Anchor every factual claim with a footnote that points to the originating review note or transcript slice so readers can audit the context.
- Prefer structured artifacts (tables, checklists, guardrail matrices) over prose-only summaries; the goal is “drop-in” operational guidance.
- Capture contradictory experiences when they exist (e.g., success vs. failure anecdotes) and explain how to reproduce both outcomes.
- Keep headings semantic (`##`, `###`) to support automated table-of-contents generation in downstream tooling.
