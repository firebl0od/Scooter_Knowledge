## Editorial Expectations

- **Anchor every factual claim** with a footnote that points to the originating review note or transcript slice so readers can audit the context.
- **Prefer structured artifacts** (tables, checklists, guardrail matrices) over prose-only summaries; the goal is "drop-in" operational guidance.
- **Capture contradictory experiences** when they exist (e.g., success vs. failure anecdotes) and explain how to reproduce both outcomes.
- **Keep headings semantic** (`##`, `###`) to support automated table-of-contents generation in downstream tooling.
- **Use footnote citations** (e.g., `[^1]`) rather than inline citations for better readability.
- **Maintain visual hierarchy** with proper spacing around headers, sections, and lists.

## Document Format

All documents follow a consistent structure:

1. **Title and Introduction**: Clear description of the topic
2. **TL;DR** (where applicable): Quick summary of key points
3. **Main Content**: Organized with clear headers, tables, and bullet lists
4. **References Section**: Footnotes linking back to source material

This format ensures documents are:
- Easy to scan and navigate
- Backed by verifiable sources
- Suitable for both quick reference and deep study
