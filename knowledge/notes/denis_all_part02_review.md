## Key Findings

### Controller Voltage Upgrades & Thermal Management
- Riders confirmed Xiaomi V3 controllers run 13S packs without hardware swaps, noting SMD resistor and dual-capacitor mods are only needed when stretching toward 20S builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L14-L209】
- For 13S builds, the group keeps stock capacitors but insists on replacing Kapton tape with 0.5 mm thermal pads so MOSFETs stay isolated while shedding heat efficiently.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L211-L223】
- Direct-soldering motor phase leads to the controller stubs (instead of chaining adapters) minimizes resistive losses and connector overheating on higher-current tunes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L283-L291】

### Tire, Wheel, and Pressure Practices
- Frequent rear flats traced back to running ~28 psi on soft Wanda tires; veterans recommend 36–50 psi, swapping to Xuancheng/CST casings, and bathing tubes/tires/rims in talc instead of oils during installation to prevent chafing.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L56-L104】
- When rotating 10 inch tires, riders orient the valve away from the footpath and rely on 9.37" wheel-size calibration in Xiaogen firmware to restore accurate speed readings.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L500-L512】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L809-L810】

### External Battery Safety & Rita Limits
- Proper Y-cables use two female battery inputs and a male controller lead, with both packs matched in voltage before connection; poorly crimped or unsoldered joints in moving bags have already shorted packs and scarred decks.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L531-L605】
- The crew warns against AliExpress “13.8 Ah” packs whose 10S2P layouts make the rating impossible, urging disputes and pointing to Samsung 22PM-based builds as a safer baseline.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L594-L607】
- Rita v4 supports up to 15S packs but still bottlenecks battery current around 25 A; higher-voltage combos need controller reinforcement, and mixing 15S externals with stock 10S internals offers little benefit.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L811-L848】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1063-L1111】
- Non-common-port externals may require bypassing Rita’s charge jack; otherwise the Xiaomi charger shows no animation even though pack voltage rises slowly.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L611-L629】

### Rita Charging, Regen, and AWD Diagnostics (Lines 10,501-12,000)
- Denis flagged Error 14 on a second dashboard that shares one battery between two controllers as a critical Rita failure—the module should block any inter-pack current flow—so builders should re-check polarity incidents or wiring before riding again.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L10541-L10598】
- When pairing a 12 S external pack with Rita, Denis reiterated that the custom firmware’s nominal voltage must stay at 51 V to keep charge limits aligned.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L10541-L10552】
- Dual-dash AWD harnesses need their battery grounds tied together while leaving the dashboards isolated; otherwise control signals misbehave once both throttles and brakes share a pack.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L10650-L10652】
- New Rita hardware adds wall-charger and KERS over-voltage protection, but Denis warned that gen 1–2 boards still rely solely on the internal BMS, and even on newer units a simultaneous BMS/Rita fault could dump full charger voltage into the pack—use higher-voltage charging only if 95 % state-of-charge is acceptable.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L11620-L11670】
- Relocating the Xiaomi charge port outside Rita is fine, yet installers must keep a three-way parallel splitter so Rita still senses charge mode; otherwise its protections won’t trigger.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L11671-L11676】
- Rita’s 25 A ceiling limits how much hill-climb torque a tiny boost pack can add—Mirono recommends either a dual-motor conversion or uprated controller before chasing sustained climbs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L11124-L11136】
- Controller thermal shutdowns that repeat every few minutes after a Rita upgrade typically trace to dried thermal compound; Denis told riders to replace paste (not pads) and monitor temperatures before the next outing.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L11695-L11704】
- During charging, Rita isolates the external pack, so riders should watch the charger LED or Rita app voltages—the scooter’s dash will stay around 99 % until the auxiliary battery finishes balancing.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L11958-L11975】

### Motor, Controller, and Hill-Climb Planning (Lines 10,501-12,000)
- Riders pushing Xiaomi 1S scooters with 3 S booster packs found the controllers overheat and shut down on steep grades; veterans advise upgrading the entire battery/ESC/motor stack—or stepping up to a purpose-built climber—rather than chasing 350 W motor swaps that add little torque.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L10655-L10691】
- If you do move to a Monorim 500 W hub, plan on air-filled tires and refreshed phase connectors so the higher currents seat firmly; otherwise the hot leads will arc under load.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L10665-L10670】
- Fake “350 W” hubs from AliExpress routinely burn when fed 62 V packs, whereas reputable 350 W motors paired with 13S–20S controllers have survived years of use—reinforcing the value of vetted suppliers such as @paolo_vlc.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L11148-L11159】
- Mirono reminded AWD builders that kV matching matters more than watt labels: Xiaomi Pro 300 W and Monorim 500 W hubs spin at similar speeds, but the widely sold “Monorim 350 W” units in Moscow are just high-kV Ali clones unsuitable for balanced dual-motor builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L11236-L11280】

### Battery Packaging, Security, and Charging Logistics (Lines 10,501-12,000)
- Handlebar battery pods don’t fit Xiaomi tubes (only nine cells max) and would be crushed in a crash; builders instead 3D-print deck drops, add rear racks, or keep packs at their feet—and they strongly discourage gambling on generic AliExpress batteries.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L10750-L10775】
- Ongoing complaints about Monorim-branded packs (snapped bolts, overstated capacities, messy wiring) underscore the need to source from safety-focused builders when mounting high-energy packs near the stem.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L10780-L10797】
- To deter theft, mount the Rita bag right-side-up with wiring tucked under the flap, then cinch the pack with two or three heavy pipe clamps or a custom cage so thieves can’t simply unzip it—goo-filling the bag only creates a mess when you need to remove the battery.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L11560-L11595】
- Using a stock Xiaomi pack as a charger for other batteries is a fire risk without a proper current limiter; instead, repurpose old packs as externals with their own BMS and charge them separately.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L11181-L11195】
- Denis’ Range + Speed kit lets both batteries charge from the bundled 50.4 V brick, but splitting them between chargers is faster, and the Rita app provides more accurate voltage readings than the scooter dash while charging.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L11958-L11975】

### Firmware, Tooling, and Flashing Tips (Lines 10,501-12,000)
- Riders still debate XiaoDash versus XiaoGen: XiaoDash sells inexpensive field-weakening presets and even advertises 20 S support, but XiaoGen’s cruise-control logic and migration tools remain more reliable for everyday commuting.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L11596-L11615】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L11600-L11610】
- Controllers already on DRV200 firmware need the m365_DownG XG Mod “intermediate” package before XiaoGen will flash again; once the clean base is installed you can reload premium configs and restore serial numbers via ScooterHacking Utility if they change.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L11734-L11855】
- Dot-style clone dashboards sometimes require removing both C16 and R1 jumpers for ST-Link to recognize the MCU—a wrinkle veterans hadn’t seen on earlier batches—after which the BLE rec flash succeeds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L11655-L11657】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L11926-L11933】

### Battery Construction and Spot-Welding Lessons (Lines 10,501-12,000)
- Builders critiqued cheap portable welders: running 52 J pulses with a soft 80 C LiPo scorched nickel and overheated leads, whereas shortening leads, solder-reinforcing traces, and pairing the welder with a high-discharge (≈180 C) pack at ≤30 J produced clean welds on 0.1–0.15 mm nickel without cooking MOSFETs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L11770-L11828】

### Maintenance, Tires, and Bearings (Lines 10,501-12,000)
- Heavy riders chasing stability don’t need water-filled tires—stick to ~5 bar on CST V3 casings or jump to 10″ Xuancheng/9×2 off-road tires for better winter grip, keeping in mind that higher pressures sap energy but protect rims.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L11437-L11475】
- Chronic speed loss on Rita builds often means the hub bearings have run dry; Johnny swaps Chinese bearings roughly every 2,000 km (sooner on solid tires) before heat and rattling balls destroy the motor.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L11975-L11989】

### Suspension, Brake, and Hardware Fitment
- Monorim V4 kits often arrive without the shim stack shown in Kroxne’s tutorial, forcing riders to add their own washers and highlighting ongoing tolerance issues between batches.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L800-L808】
- Thin M3 bolts in the Monorim V4 fender bracket shear easily; owners plan to swap in higher-grade hardware before the adapter loosens or brakes rub the rotor.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1198-L1203】

### Firmware & Speed Claims
- Xiaogen is praised as the “best” custom firmware, but veterans caution that borrowed configs can fake 42–44 km/h readings by abusing wheel multipliers; genuine >35 km/h pulls on stock 300 W motors still require higher voltage, FOC-capable ESCs, or rewound hubs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L809-L867】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1135-L1187】

### VESC Builds & Motor Selection
- KD estimates 17S VESC setups with dual Xiaomi Pro or Monorim motors top out near 60–70 km/h and stresses that VESC phase current hits harder than Xiaomi ESC figures, warranting aggressive motor cooling and, ideally, dual upgraded hubs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1283-L1296】
- Builders warn that “1000 W” Monorim hubs ship with undersized, non-gold connectors, flimsy tubeless tires, and no brake-disc support; Happy Giraffe recounts a 2 kW-induced wipeout and recommends avoiding the combo without major tire/brake changes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1290-L1303】
- Swapping a 1000 W hub into a Xiaomi requires Monorim suspension with a reversed fork to clear the larger rim and integrated 6-bolt rotor, reinforcing that the stock chassis lacks the space.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1321-L1325】
- G30 Max frames are noticeably wider than Xiaomi Pro decks, so cross-platform motor or deck swaps need custom spacers despite superficial similarities.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1445-L1450】

### ESC Thermal Management & Installation Checks
- Reapply quality thermal paste (about 4 g) between the M365 ESC and deck casting, replacing the stock yellow tape with a ≤1 mm non-conductive thermal pad and shimming the rubber puck so the controller sits flush without brake-cable interference.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1353-L1391】
- Clean old compound from both surfaces before installing the pad, verify the ESC cannot wiggle by hand, and reroute or slightly relieve the brake cable instead of grinding the chassis whenever possible.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1359-L1369】
- Happy Giraffe reports the thermal-pad swap let him sustain ~40 A battery current at comparable temps, though performance dropped after rework—underscoring careful reassembly.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1387-L1391】

### Soldering Prep & Capacitor Safety
- Before reinforcing traces, scrape conformal coatings, clean with solvent, and add solder only after discharging the controller capacitor by shorting the XT30 leads; leaving it charged causes sparks that can kill the ESC.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1464-L1487】
- Mirono and KD note discharged energy simply becomes heat and that even brief shorts are generally safe, but they caution against repeated sparks while working.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1474-L1488】

### Tire Choices for Monorim Builds
- Riders confirm air-filled tires fit the Monorim 500 W hub, recommending CST 10 × 2.5 or 10 × 3 casings to replace the stock hazardous tire before chasing higher power.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1303-L1305】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1441-L1443】

### Suspension & Wheel Fitment Updates (Lines 3,001-4,500)
- The Max-style Monorim V4 fork uses thinner mudguard brackets than the Xiaomi-specific V3, giving 10" tire builds more fender clearance when paired with the CNC “Max” hanger.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L3003-L3016】
- Xtech brakes sit higher than the stock clamp and can clear fat rotors on Monorim swingarms, but installers often have to file the caliper ears and still risk the housing touching the motor shell; oversized discs may leave pads working on <50 % of the surface.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L3331-L3351】
- Kroxne recommends keeping spare suspension hardware—folding pins, spacers, brake cables, pads, and even a V3 controller clone—on hand so breakdowns don’t strand riders while parts ship from AliExpress.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L3832-L3834】
- Monorim air-spring servicing is easier with two people: keep the fork suspended while holding the valve high, add pressure through the positive valve only, and bleed from the negative side after each adjustment, with light lithium spray on moving parts.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L4395-L4428】

### Brake, Suspension, and Cooling Updates (Lines 1,501-3,000)
- TRP Spyke mechanical brakes foul the Wheelway 500 W rim on Xiaomi Pro builds, so riders downsize the rear caliper and add metallic pads for dependable stopping without tire rub.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1501-L1504】
- Andreas outlined a liquid-cooling concept using twin MOSFET cold plates, a small radiator under the stem, and a temperature-triggered pump that only runs past ~30 °C to limit electrical load while riding.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1602-L1609】
- Owners traced burned Rita v4 photos to abusive firmware settings; veterans stress that even the charge leads can melt when current is pushed beyond design limits.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1618-L1627】
- Happy Giraffe still rates Xuancheng 10 inch tires best for stock rims but notes that 10×3 conversions demand spacer kits plus washers between the fork and hub to keep 500 W motors from rubbing.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1632-L1638】
- Kroxne reminds installers that Monorim fork brackets are secured by the axle and the spacer’s set screw; overtightening the outer bolts only strips threads without stopping the bracket from shifting.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L2986-L2996】

### Rita Operations, Charging, and BMS Emulation
- Newer Rita controllers still cap pack draw near 25 A; exceeding that limit throws an error 39 beeping sequence, so riders keep Xiaomi firmware battery limits at or below ~27–29 A peaks.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1683-L1692】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1767-L1770】
- Rita prioritizes the higher-voltage pack and only blends current once both batteries sag to the same level, so 12S externals can power the scooter even when the 10S stock pack is nearly empty.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1698-L1704】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1904-L1908】
- Denis cautions that fast-charging a 13S6P pack in one hour slashes lifespan; a 7.5 A charger strikes a healthier two-hour charge window while still doubling range versus stock 10 S energy.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1968-L1973】
- Stock Xiaomi charge ports and JST leads are only rated around 3 A, so higher-current charging requires upgraded connectors or direct-pack charging to avoid overheating.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1981-L1986】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L2697-L2700】
- Rita’s Schottky diodes drop roughly 0.6 V during charging, leaving packs slightly under 42 V; Denis recommends leaving the wiring as-is because that mild undercharge benefits battery longevity.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L2929-L2939】
- Riders report that XiaoFlasher’s built-in 13 S BMS emulator introduces throttle lag, whereas Rita’s emulation restores instant response when pairing large internal packs with the stock dashboard.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L2467-L2470】

### Charging, Rita Behavior, and Battery Planning (Lines 3,001-4,500)
- Denis confirms his “44.4 V” and “50.4 V” chargers are the same YZPower units, advising riders to resolder worn barrel plugs or reuse connectors from their stock chargers when the cords fail.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L3028-L3042】
- Rita’s series Schottky diode shaves a few tenths of a volt, so internal packs plateau near 97 %; riders either bypass Rita when charging the stock battery alone or accept the gentle undercharge for longevity.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L3045-L3063】
- The adapter’s status LED “heartbeat” blinks even with the scooter off, which Sergey notes is normal behavior documented in the manual.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L3703-L3710】
- Denis tells 48 V customers to cut Rita’s pink jumper and reinforce the controller before plugging higher-voltage externals; classic M365 owners still need trace, MOSFET, and wiring upgrades to tolerate 13S-plus packs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L3845-L3853】
- External-only riding without Rita triggers BMS communication errors and limp mode unless firmware voltage limits are raised and battery warnings suppressed—another reason the group prefers Rita’s dual-pack management.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L3966-L3998】
- Rita has two battery leads so both packs feed through its balancing and protection; stacking adapters is unnecessary and risks mismatched voltages.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L4000-L4006】
- New-generation Rita boards add current sensing that beeps and throttles output above ~25 A continuous (~30 A peaks), protecting users who previously “Miked” older units; Denis suggests 28 A battery limits when experimenting beyond spec.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L4251-L4274】
- Riders reiterate that extra voltage—not parallel 36 V packs—delivers speed gains: 36 V externals simply extend range, 12S setups need dedicated chargers, 14S suits 40 km/h goals, and 13S6P internals (~35–40 km/h) double range while staying within Rita’s charge split.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L3890-L3926】
- High-voltage ambitions require capacity: 15S packs under 4P sag excessively, cost €600–800 in quality cells, and should be paired with upgraded internals rather than stock 10S batteries.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L3896-L3904】

### Maintenance & Safety Notes (Lines 4,501-6,000)
- Flush Xiaomi discs with brake cleaner after wet rides—it is safe on pads and calipers—and periodically retorque or replace folding pins and other fasteners to avoid fatigue cracks or catastrophic rotor failures at speed.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L4509-L4575】
- Riders who swapped to full motorcycle armor and ditched solid tires report fewer crashes; the group brands solid rubber as a “death wish” once speeds climb past ~40 km/h because the carcass can unseat mid-ride.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L5530-L5539】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L5791-L5800】

### External Batteries & Charging (Lines 4,501-6,000)
- Configure Rita’s external-battery mode for 12S packs, cap firmware voltage near 51 V, and remember externals are hot-swappable only when stopped—yanking a 50 V pack mid-ride backfeeds the 42 V internal battery through the motor.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L4667-L4676】
- A 12S “speed” pack will not fit inside a Pro/Pro2 deck without lowering the floor; builders either mount 3S boosters or pursue custom 2S projects for stealth installs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L4677-L4699】
- Daly BMS units earn praise for reliability, but the crew still recommends common-port wiring on external packs and forbids charging 13S batteries through Rita’s onboard charge lead.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L5112-L5142】
- Stock charge ports and Rita’s intermediate connector stay happy below ~3 A; riders upgrade to 2.5 A YZPower chargers for quicker top-ups and splice in fresh barrel plugs when cords fatigue.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L5151-L5156】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L5495-L5498】
- Rita blends packs only when their voltages align, so a cheap €160 “10S4P” external that sags early leaves the internal battery doing all the work—test suspect packs alone at low load and expect legitimate packs with quality cells to cost more.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L5499-L5526】
- Dashboard state of charge becomes unreliable once Rita is installed; Denis advises treating 50 % on the display as the cue to head home.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L5653-L5658】
- Without Rita you must equalize voltages before paralleling an M365 spare battery with a Pro 2, whereas Rita lets you plug and play between scooters.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L5157-L5159】

### Controller & Firmware Guidance (Lines 4,501-6,000)
- Happy Giraffe’s XiaoGen flashing checklist keeps BLE stock, uses the XG Mod 21 flasher, and applies the migration file before loading custom firmware—ST-Link is the safety fallback if anything misbehaves.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L4604-L4610】
- XiaoDash’s experimental field-weakening toggles are labeled “dangerous”; veterans note they add idle speed but little road performance while risking controller damage.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L4718-L4726】
- M365 V2.1 controllers upgraded for 48 V still need the small C3A/B/C and C11 capacitors (plus the trio on the board’s back) changed; skipping them keeps temperatures high enough to threaten MOSFETs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L4888-L4912】
- Replacing the Kapton strip with a 0.5–1.0 mm thermal pad across the MOSFETs, adding paste, and ensuring the brake cable sits in its groove helps the ESC clamp flat against the deck casting.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L4918-L4918】
- Denis confirms regen can exceed acceleration current; set both drive and braking limits to ~27 A on Rita builds to avoid downhill thermal trips.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L5698-L5709】
- Smooth-throttle or quadratic power maps in custom firmware tame twitchy throttles after 12S/13S upgrades, minimizing jerk during deliveries.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L4972-L4974】

### Motors, Suspension & Fitment (Lines 4,501-6,000)
- 500 W Monorim hubs need suspension or adapters to clear a rear brake rotor, and they only deliver their rated output on 48 V; a well-cooled 350 W hub on 48 V still hits ~40 km/h while staying within comfort limits.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L4753-L4821】
- Generic front suspensions often bind; riders restore travel by polishing the inner cylinders, inserting a spacer between motor and fork to preserve alignment, and lubricating the sliders before reassembly.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L5665-L5669】
- G30 motors can be shoehorned into Monorim forks by flipping the arms, using longer bolts, and carving a cable channel, but the crew warns the stock hardware (axles, boots, fender brackets) snaps easily without higher-grade replacements.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L5873-L5995】
- Keep hall-sensor spares on hand—three-sensor rails for Xiaomi hubs are available via AliExpress and simplify future repairs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L4837-L4842】

### Battery Quality & Construction (Lines 4,501-6,000)
- Avoid bargain “brandless” 18650s and AliExpress packs; experienced builders buy from reputable suppliers, expect >€100 in cells even for tiny speed packs, and caution that cheap externals may be filled with sand or used cells.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L4738-L4746】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L5317-L5319】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L5499-L5526】
- Battery refurbishers stress testing every reclaimed cell individually and favor rigid cages or high-strength adhesives (e.g., Gorilla, Sikaflex) over bare Kapton for packs that must survive vibration.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L5190-L5207】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L5261-L5278】
- Bargain “Wish” scooters often hide their only value in the battery; the group repurposes those 13S packs but warns about the lack of spare parts and noisy drivetrains.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L5287-L5299】

### Troubleshooting Highlights (Lines 4,501-6,000)
- Persistent error 21 on Xiaomi scooters usually traces back to the XT30 battery connector or a BMS LED that has stopped blinking.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L4585-L4593】
- Error 18 after reassembly often means a damaged hall-sensor harness; swapping in a fresh cable cured the issue when two separate controllers threw the same fault.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L5827-L5832】
- Error 24 denotes supply voltage out of range—power-cycle the scooter for 10 seconds after checking battery wiring before digging deeper.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L5691-L5694】
- Denis reminds owners to keep Rita-fed externals within the manual’s 25 A continuous rating even if XiaoDash allows 32 A battery values; brief spikes are fine, but abuse still fries motors and controllers.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L3488-L3500】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L4267-L4295】

### Battery Planning and Purchasing Guidance
- Scootermode’s 13 S range-and-speed kit needs Xiaomi firmware voltage limits raised to ~55 V plus BMS emulation enabled; skipping the jumper wire on the harness or Rita causes error 21 until emulation is active.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L2395-L2401】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L2411-L2422】
- Denis equates a 13S6P pack of 2,500 mAh cells to roughly 20 Ah at 10S, letting riders roughly double Xiaomi Pro range while still charging within Rita’s 5 A shared limit by splitting across dedicated charge ports.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1968-L1990】
- Mirono flags Xiaoxiang “Smart Ant” BMS units as a reliable EU-source option when Daly doesn’t stock 12S Li-ion boards.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L2601-L2602】

### Firmware Flashing, Field Weakening, and Recovery
- XiaoGen flashing on Pro2/1S/Essential scooters requires keeping the original BLE, running the m365Downgrade XG Mod migrator once, then loading custom configs; future updates skip the migration package entirely to avoid bricks.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L1918-L1937】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L2095-L2115】
- ST-Link “target not found” errors usually trace back to wrong pin order or an unpowered controller, and flashing generic rec.bin images wipes odometer data until the serial number is restored manually.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L2563-L2571】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L2625-L2634】
- XiaoDash introduces paid “SpeedBoost” field weakening that mimics Ninebot’s magic serial trick; developers warn it boosts speed 35–40 % at the expense of range, heat, and demands for uprated batteries, MOSFETs, and cabling.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L2324-L2356】

### Firmware & Tooling Lessons (Lines 3,001-4,500)
- Multiple riders report XiaoDash beta builds quietly rewriting parameters and gutting torque, forcing half-hour recoveries; Denis advises sticking to XiaoFlasher presets until the new tool stabilizes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L3073-L3086】
- Sergey’s workflow for replacing controllers that ship with DRV200 locks is to enter the new serial, press “make FW,” flash with standard m365_DownG, power-cycle, and—if stuck—use Downg’s “repair SN” before regenerating XiaoGen firmware.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L3265-L3327】
- XiaoDash’s 20S BMS emulation is still “coming soon”; Denis is waiting on fresh PCBs before trusting it, while veterans warn that extreme 6S booster packs and 20S trace-cut builds routinely kill hardware despite the app’s promises.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L4064-L4088】
- Tire slip and braking issues often tie back to firmware choices—keeping tires at 50–60 psi restores the 40 km/h top speed targets riders chase with 12S tunes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L3211-L3236】

### Diagnostics and Component Repairs
- Lighting-triggered surging often stems from the dashboard’s F2 resettable fuse; techs either replace it with a 0 Ω link or confirm 5 V is stable under load before sourcing a new BLE board.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L2533-L2580】
- Persistent BMS error 21 on Ninebot Max-to-M365 conversions cleared once installers enabled battery-data emulation and correctly seated the control-harness jumper after waterproofing checks.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L2395-L2406】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L2427-L2436】
- Low output despite balanced cell groups often traces to failed sensing capacitors on Xiaomi BMS boards; Denis advises probing each RC network and replacing any capacitor that doesn’t mirror its cell voltage.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L2941-L2953】
- Water intrusion through the rear fender grommet can temporarily disable the pack; drying the battery for a week and jump-starting with the charger revived a soaked scooter without replacing the BMS.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L2989-L2994】

### Platform Compatibility Notes
- Tudor confirms 1,000 W hubs slot into Ninebot Max frames (with or without suspension) thanks to wider dropouts, whereas Xiaomi rears still lack clearance even when running Monorim shocks—front-only installs remain the practical Xiaomi option.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L2520-L2532】

### Maintenance, Tools, and Safety Extras (Lines 3,001-4,500)
- Sergey recommends pairing a 20–30 W temperature-controlled iron for PCB work with a ≥65 W unit for XT150-class connectors so joints flow quickly without cooking pads.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L3257-L3258】
- Riders source Statorade ferrofluid locally from Nexun in Poland and note that ferrofluid or oil only helps after addressing the stator-to-shell bottleneck with proper thermal pathways.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L3835-L3889】
- Denis is prototyping plug-and-play tracker/immobilizer modules with 5 V power supplies, fingerprint readers, and alarm speakers so scooters can sound off or cut power when moved without authorization.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L3665-L3670】
- Aftermarket Xtech brakes bite hard in the dry but rely on cheap seals that rust quickly in rain, so commuters should keep rebuild kits or spares ready for wet-weather riding.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L4233-L4243】
- Hidden trackers need their own low-dropout regulator: Sergey points riders to AMS1117-3.3 modules, fed directly from the main battery because Xiaomi controllers lack standby 5 V rails.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L4153-L4184】

### Suspension & Hardware Quality Control (Lines 6,001-7,500)
- Chao confirms Monorim’s MXR1 V2 rear revision adds brake-mount holes and a washer pocket after riders stripped the earlier axle clamp; until the new run arrives he advises hand-cutting the recess or sourcing spare parts from dual-suspension owners.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L6001-L6059】
- Installers flag the rear motor kit’s long nut and spacer as still too short for high-power hubs, recommending higher-grade hardware (12.9 bolts, longer shafts) to keep 500 W motors from tearing threads out of the aluminum swing arm.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L6037-L6047】

### Controller Cooling Experiments
- Abs’ dual-controller build clamps MOSFETs to a 3–4 mm aluminum bar with mica insulators and filtered 12 V push-pull fans, dropping case temps from 67 °C to ~40 °C during 60 A, 20 S runs; he suggests skipping the effort for mild 12–13 S tunes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L6167-L6188】
- Builders debating liquid loops conclude scooter vibration and cramped decks make sealed PC water kits risky; bolting MOSFETs directly to the frame or adding copper heat spreaders is the safer path.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L6175-L6192】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L6073-L6088】

### Rita Integration & Diagnostics Updates
- Denis notes Rita MAX (still unreleased) is the version that natively supports Ninebot Max voltage reporting; legacy Rita hardware lacks compatible plugs and data protocol without adapters.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L6232-L6251】
- AWD builders must run all three Rita data leads to a single “master” controller and forward only the white wire to the slave; tying both dashboards’ full harnesses together shorts the outputs and triggers BMS error 21.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L6433-L6456】
- Denis acknowledges a small Rita batch that under-reports current above 20 A—owners should cross-check against stock wiring, but overcurrent protection still trips in time thanks to redundant sensing tested on Ninebot Max builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L6748-L6778】
- Modern Rita firmware drops the configurable regen cutoff but instead monitors output voltage continuously, shunting surges into a 25 W resistor and spoofing −10 °C on the temp sensor to raise error 39 until the issue clears.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L7450-L7463】

### Battery Vetting, BMS Wiring, and Charger Safety
- The group warns that bargain 4 Ah lawnmower packs are built for ~180 W draws and can overheat or ignite when asked for 25 A scooter peaks; riders should verify wattage before strapping tool batteries to Rita setups.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L6610-L6635】
- Adding a 3 S booster to Xiaomi packs is viable only with a reinforced controller; otherwise the combined 13 S voltage overstresses stock ESCs and still leaves the booster under-utilized because it never fully discharges.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L6928-L6940】
- DIY pack builders share a cautionary tale of mis-wired balance leads that instantly popped a Daly BMS, stressing the need to follow the printed diagram, wire negative first, confirm each cell step with a meter, and avoid doubling wires on one pad.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L7028-L7068】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L7132-L7135】
- LiFePO₄ BMS boards cannot safeguard li-ion cells because of different voltage windows; either return the part or build a dedicated 12 S LiFePO₄ pack instead.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L7080-L7089】
- When diagnosing jerky hubs, isolate the issue by spinning the wheel with motor leads disconnected (blown MOSFETs drag) and inspect hall wiring—error 18 often traces to damaged cables or sensors rather than the controller itself.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L6633-L6665】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L7437-L7443】

### Firmware & Controller Service Notes
- Cloned controllers shipped with spoofed DRV/BLE builds often need their serial re-entered in DownG before XiaoGen will flash; on Pro1 hardware you simply load the migrate package twice, while Pro2 units require the dedicated migrator first.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L6945-L7033】
- Never reconnect a trace-cut harness while the wheel is spinning—Mike’s test lit the U4 regulator on fire, underscoring the need to power down before rewiring high-voltage mods.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L6979-L6986】

### Brake & Tire Notes (Lines 6,001-7,500)
- X-Tech calipers paired with cheap 135 mm AliExpress rotors feel weak, but swapping to a quality 140 mm disc on Tudor’s custom rear hub transformed braking performance, showing hardware choice matters more than the caliper brand alone.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L6924-L6927】
- Larger 10×2.5 in tires typically require machining the hub or frame spacers—custom-suspension owners report needing a lathe to widen the rear assembly before off-road or CST casings will clear.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L6422-L6428】

### Rita Fitment & Voltage Expansion (Lines 7,501-9,000)
- Tight decks still swallow Rita Gen 4 if you stage the harnesses: route stem leads along the controller’s side, tuck power runs under the charge port, and use the Monorim stem slack before clamping the cover so the potted balance leads are not pinched.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L7534-L7566】
- The gray loop beside Rita’s LED is the surge jumper—leave it intact for 10‑12 S builds and cut it when pairing 13‑15 S packs; Denis’ crew confirms 13S4P packs just fit Wildman’s 2 L bag if you commit to the tight squeeze or a printed cage.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L7567-L7589】
- New Rita revisions add XT60 leads, 25 A current monitoring, and over-voltage charge protection, while 48 V users must snip the pink jumper by the status LED and reconfigure the app to stay within the adapter’s 25 A continuous ceiling.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L8226-L8339】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L8249-L8252】
- Rita intentionally undercharges internals by a few tenths to preserve regen headroom—expect the stock pack to hover near 41 V at rest, pulsating as the BMS cycles, and reduce controller current if the adapter raises error 39 during sustained >25 A pulls.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L7744-L7751】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L8327-L8338】

### Lighting, Dash, and Accessory Wiring
- Xiaomi tail-light leads supply ~5 V PWM with limited current; teeing in extra lamps with Dupont jumpers is fine for testing, but riders should upgrade to permanent connectors or 12 V buck converters when powering brighter accessories.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L8129-L8158】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L8283-L8289】
- Custom internal batteries simply pass the taillight’s positive pin to the ESC—tie the lamp’s red wire to the dash lead and the negative to pack ground, and expect XiaoDash to read the board as a Pro unless you flash Pro 2 firmware.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L8708-L8714】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L8211-L8213】

### Tire, Tube, and Cooling Takeaways
- Oversize 10 in CST casings on 155 mm rims demand 2–2.5 mm of machining for a safe bead seat—grind the rim, not the tire carcass, to avoid micro-cuts that later explode at speed.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L7528-L7533】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L7680-L7686】
- 10 × 2.5 in tubes need 45° or 90° stems plus talcum-powder dusting to prevent valve tearing, and expect front Xuancheng casings to wear faster than rears—many commuters budget replacements around 1,500 km.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L8179-L8205】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L8165-L8186】
- High current maps can mimic regenerative drag or buzzing motors; one rider cured the issue by backing XiaoGen battery current down from 28 A to 26 A, reinforcing that Rita’s 25 A ceiling and motor heating go hand in hand.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L8206-L8206】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L8327-L8338】
- Ferrofluid (Statorade) remains the go-to hub coolant, but veterans pair it with bearing upgrades (6002 ZVL2RS or branded SKF/Koyo) and throttle maps capped near 25,000 “motor power constant” for endurance instead of maxing XiaoGen at 32,000.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L8993-L9055】

### Firmware & Troubleshooting Notes (Lines 7,501-9,000)
- XiaoGen migration hiccups almost always trace to bad serials—Sergey’s prebuilt DRV zip restored flashing, after which riders could generate proper configs and keep the genuine controller ID in DownG.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L8111-L8123】
- Bricked Pro 2 batteries often revive after a 10-second BMS button press; if red LEDs persist, Denis asks for per-cell voltages before suggesting repairs, highlighting the need for a multimeter even when Rita is installed.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L8730-L8755】
- Tool batteries such as Makita BL1850B packs are poor externals: Rita waits for ~36 V before blending, so the scooter barely uses their small 5 S modules—sell them and invest in 10‑12 S scooter packs with Daly common-port BMS units instead.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L8873-L8893】
- When Monorim brakes wobble or hardware snaps, swap the soft OE screws for 12.9-grade fasteners, reface the caliper mounts, and expect to sand swingarm tabs so the disc sits square; failing to rebolt the short main pin bends stems within a few jumps.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L9250-L9290】

### Motor Thermal Management & Ferrofluid (Lines 9,001-10,500)
- Riders dial Xiaogen’s “motor power constant” down to ~25,000 instead of 32,000 when they need the same 45 km/h cruise without cooking 350 W hubs, pairing the milder tune with eco-mode use on long rides.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L9030-L9056】
- Denis’ crew only adds about a quarter bottle of ferrofluid per motor; they report it fills air gaps by the magnets, allowing identical speeds with less heat, but still caution that repeated full-power climbs can melt valve stems once you stop abruptly.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L9036-L9048】
- Veterans dismiss clip-on plastic “motor coolers” as gimmicks, stressing that steady airflow plus ferrofluid are the proven ways to move heat and that better testing shows the case can run warmer because it is finally pulling energy from the stator.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L9065-L9116】

### Battery Sourcing, DIY Builds & Warranty (Lines 9,001-10,500)
- Community members call quality AliExpress packs a lottery win—if you cannot vet cells, they suggest building your own pack with verified cells rather than trusting rewrapped claims, even if Aerdu’s customs can be “fine” for some riders.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L9158-L9179】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L9163-L9174】
- Spot-welding pros note that tools are only half the equation: you need a reliable cell supply, and if you do buy a welder, kWeld is the gold standard while cheap Sunkko-style rigs are barely adequate past 0.12 mm nickel without external power upgrades.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L9184-L9184】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L9981-L9999】
- Daly BMS owners confirmed the yellow lead is the protected charge negative and that the board must sit between the pack and both load/charger leads; wiring it incorrectly or ignoring the diagram is what fried earlier boards.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L9453-L9467】
- A poorly built Mirono external pack overheated its BMS and deformed the enclosure; the vendor blamed field-weakening amperage and now doubles the heatsinks, but the thread reinforced that hobby-level packs need proper wiring, MOSFET cooling, and warranty support when things melt.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L9645-L9651】
- Builders weighing new internals confirmed 21700 cells fit 15S4P inside Xiaomi Pro frames (16S4P is the realistic ceiling) and recommended high-discharge parts like Samsung 50E, 40T, Molicel P42A, or Sony VTC6A to limit sag on powerful tunes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L9655-L9676】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L9710-L9716】

### Hardware, Suspension & Fasteners (Lines 9,001-10,500)
- Stem wobble cases boiled down to loose latch nuts and bent hinge pins; tightening the adjuster or swapping the damaged pin restored rigidity after crashes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L9224-L9235】
- Monorim installers keep replacing the kit’s soft bolts with grade 12.9 hardware, sanding caliper brackets square, and trimming adapter bolts so Xtech calipers clear—echoing the consensus that the €130 kits ship with under-specced fasteners.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L9243-L9258】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L9482-L9488】
- Owners swapping in aftermarket forks or CNC bodies still expect machining tolerances to be off; even “upgraded” Monorim rear arms may arrive without the promised accessories, so community photos and hardware swaps remain essential.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L9473-L9493】

### Rita Usage & High-Voltage Experiments (Lines 9,001-10,500)
- Testers flirting with 60 V Rita builds were urged to monitor the adapter’s temperature alarms, verify BLE firmware, and stage soft launches before full-throttle pulls because Rita still enforces its own limits and noisy motors hint at bearing wear.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L9495-L9520】
- Rita’s fuel gauge stays trustworthy when both batteries share the same voltage; swapping to a bare Y-cable only sacrifices the adapter’s hot-swapping safety, so most riders keep Rita installed even if the dashboard sits at five bars for longer trips.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L10041-L10056】

### Travel, Shipping & Logistics (Lines 9,001-10,500)
- Air travel remains impractical for full-size packs—airlines cap carry-ons at 100 Wh, so veterans either ship scooters by land couriers that accept lithium (e.g., DPD, UPS) or simply buy/rent a local scooter instead of sneaking packs onto planes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L9717-L9758】
- Even road shipping carries fire risk if handlers toss boxes, reinforcing the need for protective cases and honest declarations when mailing high-voltage packs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L9752-L9757】

### Tire, Comfort & Tubeless Lessons (Lines 9,001-10,500)
- Commuters chasing comfort confirmed that 10" pneumatic tires paired with quality suspensions (Konyk, dual-air setups) tame harsh pavement far better than stock solids, while Monorim-branded solid tires stay a crash hazard even at moderate speeds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L10019-L10100】
- Tubeless conversions on powerful hubs remain finicky: riders reported persistent leaks, rim dents, and bead-seat woes, prompting many to return to talc-dusted tubes unless they can machine the rim for a proper fit.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L10283-L10309】
- When fitting oversized tires, measure rim diameters, warm the rubber, and use talc/soap plus longer tire irons to avoid tearing beads—stock Xiaomi/Ninebot rims rarely accept thick tubeless casings without machining.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L10283-L10295】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part02.txt†L10294-L10305】

## Follow-up Ideas
- Document a step-by-step 13S Xiaomi V3 reinforcement guide (soldering hotspots, thermal pad part numbers, resistor math for >13S).
- Capture a vetted wiring checklist for Rita installs covering Y-cable strain relief, fuse positions if desired, and charging-port routing for dedicated external packs.
- Compare Monorim V4 spacer/bolt revisions versus Kroxne’s best practices to propose a standardized shim kit.
- Draft a Rita generation comparison (old vs. current sensing boards) with safe amp limits, jumper guidance, and example XiaoDash settings.
- Produce a XiaoDash recovery checklist covering SN repair, DRV migrations, and warning signs before flashing custom profiles.
