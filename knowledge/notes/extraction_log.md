# Extraction Log

Use this log to track which parts of the Telegram export have been reviewed and what insights were identified. Document partial progress so others know where to continue.

| Date | Reviewed file(s) | Summary of findings | Follow-up actions |
|------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 2025-10-08 | input_part000.json (start) | Logged hardware checklist, battery/firmware tuning talking points, high-amp experiments | Continue through remaining 2021-04-03 logs; prep processed guides |
| 2025-10-09 | telegram_to_text transcript sample | Generated `knowledge/processed/vesc_help_group/transcript_excerpt.txt` (first 500 lines) for rapid skimming | Use the new transcript tool to parse additional export slices before deep review |
| 2025-10-09 | input_part003.txt | Second-pass reorganization through 24 September: expanded the timeline with traction-control heat audits, Rage open-loop burnout lessons, radiator/dash updates, UART duty fixes, and field-weakening comparisons while refreshing theme sections with Spintend’s FET split, aluminum-PCB debris alerts, traction-control penalties, PWM/ZVF tuning, radiator geometry, cockpit safety, connector/adhesive picks, the $120 dash integrator, UART routing fixes, and track-day FW strategy.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L9-L88】 | Follow-ups now clustered by hardware, documentation, safety, and tuning—with new tasks covering the dual-FET UBOX release, radiator replication notes, UART/BLE port references, the budget dash spec, duty/FW guidance, aluminum-PCB cleanliness tracking, and traction-control heat measurements alongside existing Spin-Y, Monorim, and observer actions.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part003_review.md†L92-L121】 |
| 2025-10-10 | input_part000.txt | Reviewed the ready-made transcript covering the group kickoff, shared shopping list (dual Flipsky 7550s, Bluetooth module, CAN harness, anti-spark) and follow-up chats about displays, braking, and connector choices.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part000.txt†L1-L108】 | Promote the consolidated shopping checklist into a hardware setup guide and capture display/brake requirements in FAQs. |
| 2025-10-10 | input_part001.txt | Skimmed discussions on running 13S packs on MakerX Mini FOC controllers, hall sensor voltage expectations, and shared 300 A Spintend firmware for high-current builds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part001.txt†L1-L66】 | Validate the firmware file provenance, document safe voltage guidance for Mini FOC users, and summarize hall sensor testing best practices. |
| YYYY-MM-DD | input_part000.json | Notes about relevant discussions, message links, keywords, etc. | Additional tasks or questions |

Guidelines:
- Reference specific message IDs or timestamps when possible.
- Note any hardware configurations, firmware versions, or context that affects applicability.
- Add new rows as you work through each export file.
