## Key Findings

### Motor & Controller Tuning
- Yamal recapped common hub choices: most production scooters still ship 60H 22/3 windings, Nami’s 17/4 stock motors trade top speed for brutal launch torque just under 100 km/h, and 33/2 rewinds are the crew’s pick when circuits reward higher peak speed.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L8805-L8817】
- Rogerio toasted a Makerbase 75100 V2 by braking a 22 s build at ~5 km/h, reinforcing the need to temper regen/battery limits when stretching that hardware to 100 V packs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L8961-L8961】
- Mirono reminded 80100/84100 riders to keep regen under ~84 V on high-voltage setups; above that threshold the hardware becomes fragile even if throttle operation is fine at 22 s.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L9078-L9082】
- The group still views Makerbase’s 84100 HP as the value play versus Spintend: expect ~150 A phase from its six-FET aluminum-PCB stack, solid thermals, and Bluetooth, but no miracles beyond Spintend’s performance envelope.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L9410-L9425】
- Happy Giraffe advised capping single Monorim 500 W hubs near 80 A phase (with ferrofluid if possible), while Gabe and Tommy noted that pushing past ~65–73 A quickly overheats Xiaomi-class motors and demands battery temp sensing plus modest 30–35 A combined draw from paired 12 s packs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L9600-L9693】
- When Monorim builds chatter off the line, the fix is to re-detect halls, raise the sensored→sensorless handoff to roughly 3,000 ERPM, and switch observers to Ortega so the controller transitions cleanly instead of shaking the hub.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L9970-L10015】
- Finn and Konstantin highlighted the importance of staying in hall-sensor mode at high phase currents; switching to the Mxlemming observer enabled 150 A launches on a 10 s 5 p pack, but Mirono warned that Mxlemming saturates sooner than Ortega, so observers and current-coupling parameters need revisiting when saturation appears.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L66-L91】
- A recurring ABS over-current fault on a 20 s Ubox build led to concrete troubleshooting steps: keep absolute current only 10–20 % above motor current, rerun motor detection with different observers, halve observer gain, tweak inductance by ~20 %, experiment with PWM frequency, and avoid enabling slow-ABS because it blunts torque without solving the oscillation.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L413-L850】
- Hall sensor diagnostics were reinforced—when detection throws a "sensor absent" error despite wheel movement, inspect the thin hall leads and confirm continuity with a multimeter’s beep mode before rerunning setup.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L835-L843】
- Yoann’s dual Spintend 85 V/250 A Nami conversion surfaced tuning pain points: the controllers stay cool, but startup torque is weak, one motor clunks under load, GNSS and VESC speed disagree by ~30 km/h even after entering wheel diameter, and the Spintend Spiny 2 throttle shows noisy voltage swings—possibly from routing beside phase leads—making it hard to hold steady duty.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L1177-L1214】
- Kirill’s GT2 rewind bumped stock 5.2 mm² leads to 8 mm² cabling with ~5.7 mm² windings; Yoann widened Burn-E dropouts for the newer Lonnyo hubs and recommended warming the thicker silicone jackets with a low-heat gun (hand on the cable as a safety check) before forming the bends so the upgraded phases seat cleanly.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L5201-L5201】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L5496-L5505】
- Rogerio’s hunt for replacements underscored the pricing gap between Makerbase’s 75100 V2 (~€75 delivered) and Spintend’s 12-fet hardware (~€150); sombre_enfant noted that Izuna’s custom firmware already corrects the 75100 V2 voltage-readout bug on the aluminum case revision, making it a viable budget pick if riders can live without Spintend’s extras.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L7817-L7820】
- When Yamal asked about pushing twin 65H 33/2 hubs, Happy Giraffe advised jumping straight to Spintend’s 12-fet 250 A controller—the 80100 tops out earlier because the 150 A spec is phase current—especially for riders chasing 7–10 kW per motor.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L8348-L8352】
- Tommy confirmed Makerbase’s 75200 V2 now ships with a built-in shutdown input, giving budget builds a native key-off option instead of grafting external antisparks onto the earlier screw-terminal version.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L7572-L7580】
- Track-focused builders reiterated that fans alone can’t keep sealed controller bays cool: Yamal still wants dual intake/exhaust fans, but Her0DasH insists on bridging controller heat into the chassis with external heatsinks because enclosed air saturates quickly; Weped’s twin 30 Ah 40T packs feed opposing side fans at 145 km/h to keep electronics alive.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L10401-L10416】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L10573-L10574】
- PuneDir finally traced repeated Zero ESC failures to leaving the JK smart-BMS charge FET disabled—regen current had nowhere to go—so double-check both charge and discharge paths are enabled before testing high-voltage conversions.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L10560-L10561】
- Her0DasH coached Zero owners on hard-mounting paired VESCs: step up drill sizes to open four bolt holes, strip paint so the chassis becomes a heat bridge, clamp controllers with washers, nuts, and threadlocker, and add thermal paste plus external sinks after replacing any dried silicone pads; stuffing boxes with foam just cooks them.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L10583-L10593】
- NetworkDir warned that some Ubox batches run hot from mis-positioned sensors; the 80 V 100 A and 85 V 250 A versions fare best once you verify pad contact and sensor placement.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L10589-L10593】
- Finn reminded riders that incline readouts need an IMU—the Ubox includes a gyroscope so it self-levels on boot, whereas bare VESCs won’t show accurate slope without one.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L10601-L10604】
- Jacob’s 12 s hill climb meltdown underscored basic triage: melted phase leads from cold solder joints can short a motor and kill FETs, so test each MOSFET drain-to-source, inspect both board sides, and only reconnect after verifying the Bluetooth module and 5 V rail still light up.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L10695-L10705】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L10733-L10770】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L10675-L10679】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L10943-L10955】
- Before repowering suspect controllers, Her0DasH had builders use a multimeter’s beep mode between pack leads and every phase to catch shorts, then measure the 5 V accessory port; if the rail is dead, isolate hall supplies with a pair of 1N4148 diodes and inspect the resettable fuses that guard the Ubox’s 12 V/5 V/3.3 V rails and ignite port.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L10800-L10819】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L10927-L10955】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L10994-L10997】
- After Franchesco’s controllers smoked, haku steered him toward Spintend or premium Tronics/Trampa hardware as proven replacements that stay cool under hard riding.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L7590-L7595】
- Nucular’s 24F remains alluring but scarce; sombre_enfant and haku warned it’s heavy, costs four figures, and is harder to source than a 3Shul C700, which they view as the more practical high-power upgrade path today.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L8553-L8560】
- Jacob’s question about driving two motors from one controller reminded the crew that “dual ESC” housings actually contain two linked boards sharing a heatsink, making them suitable for dual 500 W Monorim builds so long as each phase channel stays within spec; Gabe added that his 2×500 W setup held 75 km/h without cooking the motors.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L8702-L8723】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L8734-L8737】
- French race crews still cap competition builds at 22 s: today’s 30 s hardware can’t feed the same battery amps, so the winners stick with 22 s 18 p packs rather than sacrifice punch for voltage headroom.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L14847-L14855】
- PuneDir’s new Makerbase budget VESC is shorter than a Spintend but relies on a bottom-facing heatsink that needs custom mounting and active airflow, so the group expects thermal limits unless the case is reworked.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L14966-L14980】
- Yamal reminded 65 H 33/2 owners that the high-Kv speed windings demand ≥12-fet controllers and motor-specific harnesses—generic 10 AWG silicone won’t survive inside the axle and the thin stock phases already run hot under big controllers.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L15021-L15039】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L15091-L15100】
- NetworkDir’s Makerbase shunt swap to a 1.7 mΩ stack halved the reported current until he reflashed 6.02, so anyone copying the mod needs to retune the resistance values and detection or accept bad telemetry.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L15492-L15506】
- The crew treats Fardriver controllers as the affordable high-current alternative—models reach 2,600 A and Weped’s Sonic reportedly ships them stock—while VESC remains the premium, more fragile option at those power levels.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L15924-L15957】

### Motor & Controller Tuning (Lines 101–200 re-pass)
- Franchesco’s 20 s Makerbase 75200 build is already brushing 117 km/h even before the QS8 connectors and spark-gap antispark are installed; he’s running a Y-split 20s5p harness in 10 AWG while prepping for dual-drive packaging.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L101-L113】
- Mixing dissimilar windings (e.g., 22×3 rear with 33×2 front or 75 H vs. 50 H hubs) remains a non-starter—Mirono and Gabe warned that the mismatched kV spawns tuning headaches and reliability issues even if a few riders have tried it.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L115-L123】
- Keep MOSFET temps under control: Mirono reiterated 100 °C as the absolute ceiling and 70 °C as a practical limit, Happy Giraffe echoed the 70 °C guideline, and haku’s 100/100 VESC promptly climbed to 70 °C until he re-applied thermal paste.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L123-L146】
- Jan continues to champion thick aluminum controller enclosures, noting his “aluboxes” refuse to climb more than ~5 °C over ambient compared with other hardware Izuna has seen.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L136-L141】
- QS90 inrunners remain on the radar: Happy Giraffe likes their geared IPM core for lower hub temps and extra torque, while Gabe cautioned that marketing wattage claims still need verification against factory specs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L181-L193】

### Tires & Consumables (Lines 101–200 re-pass)
- Her0DasH reminded the group that yellow-marked casings are tubeless; tube-type carcasses won’t seal without an inner tube even if the tread looks similar.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L142-L143】

### Displays, Controls & Fabrication (Lines 101–200 re-pass)
- Eye4 displays still lack a turnkey VESC firmware path—sombre_enfant can source units with Bluetooth, but Mirono confirmed no public firmware exists despite Camilo’s past demo, and Tommy’s rewrite effort needs full UART plus the single-wire wake lead before a VESC-first build is possible.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L147-L161】

### Battery, Accessories & Security (Lines 101–200 re-pass)
- Gabe is stretching a Xiaomi Pro 2 to 20 s by pairing an internal 11s8p with an external 9 s module in series, routing balance leads externally, while PuneDir repurposed a 16s6p pack down to 14s6p for a Zero build—reminding everyone to document voltage claims clearly before test rides.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L186-L198】

### Motor & Controller Tuning (Lines 19 300–20 799)
- Yamal and Paolo confirmed that Tronic 250 claims are optimistic—leaving phase current near 230 A caused thermal cutouts, so their race setups now target roughly 200 A rear/180 A front (with moderate field-weakening) and reserve the published 250 A figure as an absolute ceiling.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L19546-L19567】
- Yoann’s brand-new 3Shul batch showed −70 °C FET readings on the slave controller, pointing to a missing or failed MOSFET NTC and reminding techs to validate sensor wiring before first ride rather than assuming factory QC caught it.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L19570-L19576】
- PuneDir documented why Makerbase’s 84100/84200 power-button circuit frustrates riders—it expects a normally-closed switch through the STM32—and shared the 1 MΩ pull-down mod that converts it back to a familiar Ubox-style key ignition.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L19586-L19711】
- The same thread highlighted how 60 A battery and ~180 A phase currents sit safely within the 84100’s comfort zone, but network builders still monitor motor temps because 10x3 street tires can wobble and overheat before the electronics complain.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L19804-L19809】
- Spin Y throttles remain viable on Spintend and Ubox installs: Version 1 units need custom JST‑1.0 leads into ADC2/COMM2, Version 2 tidies the wiring with a four-conductor harness, and riders continue to favor the hall-based thumb option for regen modulation.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L19677-L19707】
- Builders reiterated that ferrofluid/Statorade materially improves hub cooling by replacing the air gap between stator and magnets—just vet the datasheet because some mixes flash at low temperatures and overheated magnets can demagnetize above ~80 °C on budget hubs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L20019-L20098】
- Rosheee’s dyno/road logs showed why 65 H stators are coveted: even a single 16 s 6 p M50LT pack with a 60 A BMS outran dual 50 H hubs from 0–30 km/h, though the lower Kv costs some top speed compared with 60 H windings.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L20037-L20078】

### Motor & Controller Tuning (Lines 20 800–21 537)
- Jesús now runs his Rion on a 100 V (24 s) pack instead of 72 V (20 s) and pairs it with a Tronic 250R; he noted the front wheel still skids near 120 km/h, highlighting how 24 s launches demand serious traction and restraint.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L20803-L20821】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L20846-L20848】
- Paolo’s Kaabo Mantis example shows what careful tuning can do: a ~$100 controller, 60H hubs, and a 21s6p pack (with mediocre cells) still pushed past 130 km/h without a damper, and he added that Rion only mounted BAC 4000 units on the Thrust while production scooters stuck with Tronics—dual BACs simply parallel the throttle signal when they are paired.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L20921-L20938】
- When deadword complained that a 75100 build had speed but no torque, the crew reminded him phase amps create launch force; his Ninebot G30 on a 72 V LG pack was capped at 35 A motor/45 A absolute, so the fix is to raise motor current (within hardware limits) before expecting harder pulls.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L20914-L20918】
- Rochee recapped that lowering phase amps cured the cuts and grinding noises on Jesús’s tune, whereas maxing them out again—on top of heavy field-weakening—brought the issues right back, reinforcing the need to keep phase ceilings realistic on high-voltage Rions.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L21452-L21472】

### Battery, Accessories & Security (Lines 19 300–20 799)
- JK’s smart BMS lineup includes an optional cellular tracker—SIM-powered with remote lock support—but the module is bulky enough that owners plan on tucking it inside pack shrink or adding inductive charging to avoid constant disassembly.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L19916-L19933】
- PuneDir’s mixed-pack Zero (20 s 7 p internal + 20 s 4 p booster) underscored how quickly high phase current chews capacity; peers urged bumping each controller toward 100 A battery current and upgrading to 60–65 H motors before chasing more torque.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L20037-L20072】
- Ferrofluid sourcing tips landed alongside the thermal guidance: Ferrotec APG1110 remains the benchmark, but Supermagnete’s 10 mL bottles have proven reliable for EU riders tuning Xiaomi and G30 hubs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L20019-L20088】

### Battery, Accessories & Security (Lines 20 800–21 537)
- Yamal’s race recap emphasized battery-sizing trade-offs: the Miniwalker ran strong on a lighter pack because voltage sag stays manageable on short circuits, whereas bigger batteries reduce sag but add weight that slows lap times.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L21409-L21413】
- Crimekillz flagged that Jiabaida’s site is offline and that a “6–22 s” JBD smart BMS listing actually documents support for only 6–21 s, so builders should verify firmware and voltage limits before trusting those boards in 22 s stacks.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L21526-L21527】

### Frame, Suspension & Braking (Lines 19 300–20 799)
- C-suspension geometry talk resurfaced when JPPL’s 150 mm shocks forced Zero-style frames to scrape mid-corner; Kirill walked him through redrawing the rake line so it passes through the steering bearings, keeping the stock 165 mm baseline for track work.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L19672-L19673】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L19387-L19391】
- Another Vsett 11 owner cured wobble by sliding the fork tubes to increase steering angle, confirming that subtle ride-height tweaks can calm high-speed braking oscillations without adding a damper.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L19406-L19408】
- Dual-disc debates clarified that most Zero/Vsett/Teverun/Kaabo models ship both rotors on the left; swapping sides demands aftermarket adapters and typically only works with budget calipers, while premium Magura/Hope setups stay left-mounted.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L19851-L19868】

### Frame, Suspension & Braking (Lines 20 800–21 537)
- Yamal confirmed that Nami will sell a complete rolling chassis for roughly €1,200 (motors about €800 extra), but stock swingarms only clear up to 70H hubs—fitting 75H/90H motors means spreading the arms and reworking the mounts.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L21416-L21442】
- PuneDir found a €250 donor chassis with suspension to rebuild, though Mirono warned the frame looked weak—inspect cheap frames carefully before stuffing in high-torque drivetrains.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L21344-L21357】
- Sombre_enfant advised racers to run purpose-built tubeless rims (such as RFP’s custom hoops) with proper beads after a competitor lost a tire mid-ride; the same builds lean on Amass 8 mm bullets to match the fatter phase leads.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L21377-L21391】

### Displays, Controls & Fabrication (Lines 19 300–20 799)
- S1m0n detailed the process for reterminating Vsett displays: drill a tiny hole in a lower corner, lever the ultrasonically welded shell apart, resolder or reroute the six-wire harness (noting RX/TX orientation), then reseal with a quality two-part adhesive and warm air for the throttle sticker.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L20003-L20014】
- Haku and Her0DasH reminded metalworkers that bonding heatsinks to scooter frames still favors mechanical fasteners—brazing aluminum requires specialty fluxes, risks galvanic corrosion when mixed with brass, and is difficult enough that even pros treat it as a last resort.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L19431-L19528】
- Mirono unveiled a compact aluminum-PCB controller meant as a Makerbase competitor for Xiaomi/G30 decks; the group still wants confirmed specs (12 V rail access, capacitor clearance) before recommending it over the proven 75100 units.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L19825-L19846】
- NetworkDir and PuneDir continue developing an open-source VESC display with profile switching and GitHub-bound code, while also chasing better mounts for narrow 22 mm bars so commuters can adopt the interface without custom stems.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L19813-L19900】

### Displays, Controls & Fabrication (Lines 20 800–21 537)
- Yamal’s heatsink mock-ups sparked a reminder from Finn and Jan that external fins only work with airflow—drop the heatsink through the deck, drill and tap it for anchors, and bolt the controller straight to the frame with thermal paste instead of leaving fins flush where hot air can’t escape.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L21315-L21345】
- R3VOLT’s wiring questions led to practical soldering advice: replace corroded XT60s instead of bathing them, heat the bullet connector (not the wire) so solder flows, and slide the molded cover back on to hide the last ~3 mm of the banana before shrinking insulation to prevent shorts.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L21322-L21333】

### Motor & Controller Tuning (Raw IDs 221 649–221 725)
- Yoann flagged odd behaviour while testing the TCP hub and plans to capture full VESC Tool logs on the next outing so the group can diagnose it properly.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L409500-L409522】
- After additional pulls he lowered the tune because the hub motor is already saturating, so further gains will require hardware changes instead of more current in software.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L410118-L410132】
- Yoann confirmed the new hub uses a 70 mm magnet stack and ultimately fits an 11 inch rim despite initial guesses about a 12 inch wheel.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L410920-L410938】

### Battery, Accessories & Security (Raw IDs 221 649–221 725)
- The crew recommended screen-recording smart-BMS telemetry or exporting VESC logs when chasing discharge peaks; Yamal keeps references in the Xmatic app and recorded roughly 286 A (~24 kW) while Yoann noted their dual-controller build has yet to exceed about 290 A battery draw.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L409637-L409970】
- Magura MT5e brake sets remain a go-to upgrade—Yamal even dropped a live cart link—prompting Haku and Mirono to note that the pricing is lower than expected for a quality kit.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L410758-L410932】

### Displays, Controls & Fabrication (Raw IDs 221 649–221 725)
- PuneDir shared photos of a “world first” Makerbase 84100 HP key-ignition mod designed by @fungus93, asked for it to be archived, and reiterated that the wiring tweak is easier than the older 75100 conversion—though Mirono still wants clearer instructions before trying it.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L409992-L410360】
- Haku surfaced a drilling-guide short for builders who struggle to drill square holes, giving the crew an off-the-shelf jig for cleaner controller and bracket installs.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L410840-L410884】

### Frame, Suspension & Braking (Raw IDs 221 649–221 725)
- Yamal remains wary of single-sided monoarm forks on high-power scooters even though similar layouts work on certain motorcycles, so the crew still favors dual-leg assemblies for stability.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L410460-L410508】

### Troubleshooting (Raw IDs 221 649–221 725)
- Deadword’s Ninebot G30 with a Makerbase 75100 V2 and the stock display keeps throwing a “10 error” until it’s introduced to VESC Tool, so expect to program the dash after controller swaps to clear the fault.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L410572-L410744】

### Motor & Controller Tuning (Raw IDs 221 726–221 832)
- Yoann’s 20s10p build still uses the older Lonnyo hubs with only 7–8 mm of axle clearance, so he’s stripping the factory leads and threading thicker phase cables to keep his VSS setup happy after confirming the current bundle can’t pass 10 mm conductors.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L411023-L411220】
- Yamal reiterated that acceleration-focused riders should stay on 22/3 windings and watch controller temperatures—he aims to keep electronics below ~60 °C and spaces out summer pulls even with large controllers.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L411023-L411268】

### Battery, Accessories & Security (Raw IDs 221 726–221 832)
- Yoann reopened his packs to snake in new temperature-sensor wiring and added extra sleeving between the phase leads so the bundle sheds heat instead of cooking the insulation.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L411320-L411360】

### Frame, Suspension & Braking (Raw IDs 221 726–221 832)
- Magura MT5e kits continue to price around $200 for a front/rear pair—Paolo confirmed Haku’s Jenson USA cart was fair, Haku immediately bought the set, and he noted the retailer ships via DHL.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L411460-L411884】
- Haku plans to keep burnout-friendly brakes by leaving e-brake sensors unplugged and would repurpose a single MT5e for the rear if the order short-shipped, while Yamal strips non-essential loads (lights, sensors) and Haku is still checking if the thick calipers clear his front end.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L411680-L411940】

### Wiring, Sensors & Diagnostics (Raw IDs 221 726–221 832)
- A new VESC convert already runs XT150 motor leads and asked whether the controllers’ dual XT90s could split power while he stays on lower current; he also flagged the vendor’s 12 V light signal, while PuneDir’s demo video confirmed the showcased setup is rear-wheel-drive only with brutal power on tap.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L411820-L412120】

### Displays, Controls & Fabrication (Raw IDs 221 726–221 832)
- The crew is planning phone-based dashboards for their VESC swaps: one rider will start with a used handset, mount it on a Quad Lock, and eventually dedicate an iPad mini or refurbished spare after Haku joked about running a tablet for flex.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L411880-L412420】

### Motor & Controller Tuning (Raw IDs 221 833–221 897)
- User1853509047 grabbed a pair of Spintend 85 V/250 A controllers because their thinner housings can hide under a skid pan, but he still plans to cap the build at 20 s packs—reusing his stock battery as an extended scooter/Segway pack—and will leave his existing Nucular 24F on the Segway until the new duo is dialed.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L412500-L412687】
- He’s already bracing for packaging work: the 85/250s may require a larger deck and even dual 100/100 installs have forced the crew to shave chassis “ears,” so he’s weighing external mounts ahead of the wiring session with Haku.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L412827-L413204】

### Battery, Accessories & Security (Raw IDs 221 833–221 897)
- Jan’s Ninebot G30 blueprint fits a 20 s 6 p pack with a 550 A BMS and twin Spintend 85/250 controllers entirely inside the chassis, but only after adding a 30 mm deck spacer for breathing room.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L413428-L413444】
- Haku caved and ordered AMS battery holders so he can build multicolor clamp sets for upcoming pack projects, signaling fresh documentation needs once they’re tested.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L413565-L413582】

### Frame, Suspension & Braking (Raw IDs 221 833–221 897)
- Jan cautioned that the brake lever he photographed was the worst he has used thanks to plastic threads and screws, so builders should treat that aftermarket option as suspect even if it pairs with Magura MT5(e) calipers.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L413465-L413548】

### Tires, Valves & Media (Lines 501–600 re-pass)
- Blade 800 W owners still end up notching the split rim so a beefier Schrader stem clears the casting; valve extensions help with inflation but Paolo and Awyba consider trimming the rim the only reliable way to seat larger valves on compact wheels.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L512-L521】
- The same slice confirmed 10×2.5 tubes balloon inside 10×2.125 tires and feel unsafe—stick with 10×2 tubes for narrow casings and replace mangled tubes rather than stretching oversized ones.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L494-L515】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L543-L547】
- Track crews captured race footage with Insta360 rigs mounted off-scooter (tripod or ground mounts) because full-size gimbal cameras proved too bulky for jumps, nudging riders toward 360° cameras such as the X3 for reliable capture on 10+ series scooters.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L525-L541】
- Haku’s hunt for busbar fabrication shortcuts reconfirmed that hobby-grade diode lasers only engrave copper; cutting 0.2 mm sheet still demands industrial CO₂ hardware or manual methods such as drilling pilot holes and following the outline with a coping/“leaf” saw, heavy-duty shears, and patient handwork.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L542-L590】
- Laser safety came up again—multi-kilowatt beams blind bystanders instantly, so home builders should budget full enclosures, interlocks, and camera monitoring if they ever graduate to CO₂ machines instead of treating them like desktop toys.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L561-L584】
- Gabe is rebuilding his 800 W Blade around a 13s5p LG MH1 block plus a 3s6p stack of repurposed EVE ES2 cells for extra capacity while reserving P42A cells for a dual 22×3 80100 race scooter, underscoring the need to match chemistries to expected current draw when mixing fresh and salvage packs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L495-L599】

### Wiring, Sensors & Diagnostics (Raw IDs 221 833–221 897)
- Yamal’s latest build photos show QS8 connectors on the high-current leads, reinforcing the shift toward large-format plugs on these multi-controller conversions.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L413723-L413809】

### Motor & Controller Tuning (Raw IDs 221 898–223 166)
- Yamal highlighted the Miniwalker’s race win to remind builders that lighter packs can be an advantage on technical circuits—big batteries sag less but slow the scooter, and rider skill still decides the podium.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L21409-L21413】

### Battery, Accessories & Security (Raw IDs 221 898–223 166)
- Paolo warned that stacking two BMS units in series is a bad idea and that the pictured high-power build actually used a single controller-side BMS, so future pack plans should stick with parallel architectures or a single brain.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L21276-L21282】
- Crimekillz flagged that Jiabaida’s site is offline and even the “6–22 s” JBD listing is ambiguous about whether it really supports 22 s, so everyone sourcing those boards should confirm firmware limits before ordering.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L21526-L21527】
- Raphaël confirmed that the custom tubeless race rim they were discussing runs Amass 8 mm bullets on the high-current leads, underscoring the connector size those setups expect.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L21377-L21378】

### Frame, Suspension & Braking (Raw IDs 221 898–223 166)
- Sombre_enfant credited a bespoke rim profile for keeping tubeless tires seated through races and pointed the crew toward rfp-performance.com for orders or direct deals, giving builders a vetted source when stock split rims pop beads.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L21377-L21391】
- Yamal relayed that Rocket James can supply nearly complete Nami frames for about €1,200 (motors add ~€800) but they ship without motors, controllers, or batteries, and squeezing 75 H or 90 H hubs still means spreading the swingarms beyond the stock 70 H clearance.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L21416-L21447】
- The crew joked about drag drivetrains but agreed most purpose-built scooters lean on chain drives, with only a few belt builds floating around as counterexamples.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L21533-L21537】

### Wiring, Sensors & Diagnostics (Raw IDs 221 898–223 166)
- Haku and Gabe reiterated that the dual QS8 harness they were planning needs 6 AWG leads, reinforcing how chunky the cabling gets once you chase hundreds of amps.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L21216-L21217】
- R3VOLT’s soldering thread ended with clear guidance: heat the bullet, keep the shrink in place to prevent shorts, expect it to cover a few millimetres of the banana, and replace corroded XT60s instead of trying to revive them with vinegar.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L21322-L21333】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L21328-L21331】

### Displays, Controls & Fabrication (Raw IDs 221 898–223 166)
- The heatsink debate landed on cutting deck openings or sandwiching the sink directly to the frame: Finn prefers drilling and tapping the fins rather than removing the base plate, while Yamal may trim four fins per side so his 20 × 10 cm block drops through a 17 × 10.5 cm sheet for real airflow.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L21317-L21321】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L21339-L21343】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L21379-L21380】

## Follow-ups
- Compile the recurrent Makerbase failure modes (hall shorts, melted phase leads, spontaneous 84100 HP death) and spell out hall isolation plus strain-relief mods before more builders cook replacements.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L1501-L1576】
- Capture the bench hall-sensor test (5 V supply plus multimeter or magnet sweep) so riders can validate sensors before sealing hubs back up.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L1683-L1708】
- Track the Spinny V2 throttle harness issue and note any firmware safeguards that appear so regen can fail safe if the throttle signal goes erratic.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L1604-L1613】
- China’s experimental dual-stator hubs look wild on paper but sombre_enfant warned they distort flux enough to undermine performance, so the group is holding out for real data before embracing the concept.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L15912-L15918】
- Jan pegged realistic race outputs around 35–40 kW, pointing out that rental-grade G30 electronics can swing 30 kW but the packs collapse beyond ~20 kW, making 140 km/h on 10″ frames the sane ceiling while 11″ chassis carry the extra stability margin.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L16552-L16571】
- Yamal is ready to cut the controller plate out of his Nami to bolt on a massive external heatsink and may revert to Kelly controllers because Tronics still overheat during stop/start circuit sessions even with 37 A of field weakening and a new high-discharge pack.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L16556-L16559】
- PuneDir still logged 74 °C on a heavily modded Makerbase 75100 after an aggressive ride, underscoring that these cases need genuine airflow or chassis heat sinking even when the baseplate looks “proper.”【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L17274-L17278】
- Jan argues that slapping fans or steering dampers on a scooter is a band-aid—if a VESC cruises past ~50 °C or a frame tankslaps, fix the heatsink and trail instead of masking the bad engineering.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L17521-L17541】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L17548-L17564】

### Battery Architecture & Cells (Lines 201–300 re-pass)
- Packing 72 cells into a 3 L Wildman-class bag is technically possible but demands folded copper interconnects and abandoning cell holders—PuneDir immediately pushed back, reiterating that holderless bricks are unacceptable for reliability.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L236-L239】
- Blade-powered Xiaomi conversions are juggling multiple pack formats: Gabe is reserving a 20 s 8 p module for his “clean” Pro 2, dropping a 20 s 4 p LG MH1 pack into a beater frame, and considering 16 s 5 p or 13 s 6 p layouts to tame MH1 voltage sag when bag space or wiring makes 21700 cells impractical.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L252-L263】
- Xiaomi G30 builds already wheelie on a single 10 s Blade motor, and the crew expects dual 10 s stacks with field weakening to hit 72 V equivalents—one more reason to stage higher-voltage packs and matching controllers before going twin motor.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L241-L247】
- Cell selection is pivoting toward 21700 formats: Samsung 6A and Lishen LR21700 12 A cells are deemed “plenty” for Blade motors, and Konstantin confirmed the LR2170LA variant survives sustained draws above its 3 C/12 A label.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L271-L277】
- Happy Giraffe reminded everyone that chasing 48 A battery current at 72 V is ~3.5 kW already; he’d rather raise voltage and lean on ~100 A phase (good to ~50 % duty) fed by a 72 V 50 A pack than stack more battery amps into MH1 cells.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L273-L277】
- Mirono cataloged actual 21700 diameters—Samsung 50E sits ~21.12 mm with wrap, Molicel P42A around 21.34 mm, Lishen LR21700 near 21.4 mm, and LG M58T balloons toward 21.6 mm—underscoring why 3D-printed holders need oversized test cuts to avoid crushing cells.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L283-L296】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L290-L290】
- Face de Pin Sucé and Mirono echoed that, if budgets allow, SmartDisplay dashboards remain the “just buy it” answer versus improvising cheaper data readouts for these higher-power builds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L297-L299】
- Capture the follow-ups: document safe copper-fold alternatives for 3 L bags that preserve mechanical retention, expand the cell-diameter table in the battery-pack playbooks, and price Samsung 6A/Lishen LR21700 supply so Blade conversions stop relying on saggy MH1 bricks.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L236-L296】

### Motor & Controller Tuning Updates (Lines 17 800–19 299)
- PuneDir noted that Makerbase’s 84100 HP ships with a normally closed ignition lead—owners either need an NC key switch or must rewire the input before grafting it into Zero-style harnesses.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L18489-L18495】
- Field tests showed the 84100 HP can sustain 200 A phase even while hanging in free air, and teardown photos highlighted integrated MOSFET ignition, phase filtering, and serviceable 0 Ω link “fuses” that sacrifice themselves before the logic rails burn.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L18737-L18746】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L18912-L18912】

### Battery Architecture & Power Delivery
- Finn recommended leaving JK active balancing enabled, tightening the delta to 0.01 V, and dialing current back to ~0.2 A—plenty even for 7 p modules compared with Daly’s ~30 mA passive bleed.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L9302-L9326】
- Gabe’s Amazon-sourced 20 s pack only held 81.8 V post-charge, pointing to mismatched 4.1 V/3.8 V series groups and a bargain BMS or charger that can’t maintain CC‑CV, reinforcing the risk of “0.2 € cell” assemblies.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L9473-L9493】
- Reviving long-stored M365 batteries takes care: 2.8 V cells aren’t dead yet, but builders suggested slowly topping them above 3 V—potentially with a supervised 12 s charger bump—before attempting normal use.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L10058-L10064】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L10129-L10134】
- Tommy and Mirono mapped a quick shutdown hack for Makerbase boards by cutting the 5 V step-down trace and gating the 12 V chip, but both cautioned that regulator is fragile and best reserved for emergency resets.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L10131-L10137】
- Field reports show JK smart BMS units can cook balance resistors within a day; several builders are reverting to ANT boards for charge-only duty with fuse-backed discharge to sidestep the failures.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L10170-L10200】
- NetworkDir’s latest JK warranty run ended with an $8 coupon and a request to mail back the burned board, so the chat now flatly tells newcomers to skip JK BMS purchases.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L15112-L15114】
- Mirono logged an extra 3–4 V of voltage sag when ambient dropped to 1 °C and advised easing battery amps in the cold to protect range and pack temperature.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L15128-L15133】
- NetworkDir’s 72 V 29.8 Ah race pack still works at 100–120 A despite 8–10 V droop, provided the BMS threshold stays clear—good context for racers planning similar duty cycles.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L15165-L15175】
- Mirono also reminded shoppers that only JK offers active balancing; Daly’s ~30 mA and LLT/JBD’s ~100–160 mA passive boards are usually enough, so high-amp BMS choices should revolve around heat and packaging needs instead of marketing claims.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L16221-L16221】
- Gabe is pairing a Jiabada 230 A (575 A peak) smart BMS with dual Spintend 80100s and QS8 connectors on his 20s8p build to guarantee thermal headroom—even if it means isolating the dual-sided heatsinks from nearby cells.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L15841-L15858】
- Tommy also logged the stock M365 BMS behavior—charge FETs open near 4.15–4.25 V per cell, and the diode dies above ~4 A—so 48 V chargers work in a pinch as long as current stays gentle.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L10152-L10157】
- Builders are pushing compact frames with unconventional series stacking: e.g., an internal 11 s 8 p pack paired with an external 9 s add-on via exposed balance leads to reach 20 s, alongside 20 s 5 p Y-split harnesses, underscoring the need for separate BMS protection per module to keep mixed packs manageable.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L104-L112】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L186-L205】
- Pack assembly tactics varied—threaded rods or superglue between PETG cell holders, tape plus hot glue for individual cells, and epoxy for heavier builds—providing practical attachment options before welding busbars.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L363-L374】
- Gabe is printing a 5.4 cm deck extender so a 20 s Molicel pack can stack beneath dual ESCs, highlighting how every millimeter counts when combining 2.7 cm-thick controllers and cells in Xiaomi-class frames.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L10606-L10607】
- Gabe’s “fastest Pro 2” project shows how tight Xiaomi decks are at 20 s: he’s splitting a 20s7p pack across dual shoulder bags (4p + 3p modules) using Ninebot battery cases, measured the deck at roughly 10.5–11 cm wide with only 0.3–0.5 cm extra clearance (just enough for an 800 W Mini 4 Blade module), and expects to need twin 5 L bags to squeeze in a full 20s8p unless James prints a bespoke enclosure.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L7383-L7395】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L7511-L7516】
- Yamal and Gabe reiterated that high-power phase leads should stay multi-strand copper in silicone or PTFE jackets—PVC house wire can’t take scooter heat or tight bends—so upgrades focus on better insulation rather than gimmicky alloys.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L10774-L10797】
- Sombre_enfant’s lighting plans show why stout DC/DC converters matter: the Ubox buck rails sag under heavy accessories, so riders either add a dedicated 12 V 3 A module (Dualtron-style) or an external supply, never a hacked mains brick tied across the HV capacitor.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L10919-L10926】
- Connector choices escalated alongside pack current—Kirill pointed out QS10 plugs are rated ~180 A while QS12 handles ~300 A, making the latter the right fit for 175 A-per-controller setups where QS8 would run hot.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L11057-L11066】
- Mirono signed off on 0.15 mm pure-nickel strip in a W-bridge layout for ~40 A scooter packs, sparing builders from copper busbar work so long as the layout keeps individual cells under that current.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L7658-L7668】
- PuneDir and Gabe defaulted to ordinary duct tape to clamp two-piece holders when Kapton wasn’t handy—Kapton works but costs more, while clear packing tape is a last resort—highlighting simple ways to lock modules together before final wrapping.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L7704-L7716】
- Slow stock chargers explain long recovery times: a 1.75–2 A brick needs roughly 11 hours to refill an 18.2 Ah Zero 10X pack from ~50 V to 54 V, so prolonged charge sessions are normal rather than symptomatic of a dying battery.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L1110-L1125】
- LLT/JBD smart BMS units impressed riders thanks to compact cases, configurable limits, gentle capacitor pre-charge that capped inrush to 20 A, and integrated Bluetooth, though they still lack the PWM-controlled soft-start current shaping that ANT’s app exposes; builders weigh those tradeoffs against JK’s active balancing when choosing high-voltage protection.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L3450-L3470】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L3479-L3488】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L3496-L3502】
- Mr.Mou’s hunt for a key switch on a JK-protected G30 pack highlighted that some smart BMS boards expose Bluetooth toggles that double as an enable pin, but if the scooter draws 100 A bursts you still need a purpose-built antispark instead of stuffing an overrated relay into the deck.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L6504-L6517】
- Happy Giraffe advised setting the VESC low-voltage end above the BMS cutoff so power tapers gracefully before the BMS trips, and pairing that with temperature sensing on marginal packs to catch sag-induced heating early.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L7674-L7676】
- Happy Giraffe’s cell test data shows why high-discharge chemistries matter: Molicel P45B delivers more usable energy than Samsung 50S at 30 A, while P42A and Samsung 40T run hotter and fall off harder by 40 A; he keeps pack temps below ~60 °C and treats 80 °C as runaway territory.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L8053-L8076】
- When stepping up to 35 A continuous leads, Gabe doubled 14 AWG runs after Happy Giraffe warned that single 14 AWG sits at the limit for longer paths and AWG12 is safer, with any extra heat just wasting energy inside cramped decks.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L8291-L8296】

### Thermal Management & Reliability
- Swapping the Makerbase 75100 V2 temp-sense resistor for a 01C (10 kΩ) cures the misreported motor temperatures that plague newer batches.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L10152-L10152】
- Members agreed that MOSFET case temperatures should stay below ~70 °C in routine riding; exceeding 100 °C dramatically shortens controller life. Flipsky’s aluminum enclosures help here—Jan reports they rarely climb more than 5 °C above ambient.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L136-L146】
- Mixing different KV windings (e.g., 22×3 rear with 33×2 front) was discouraged because VESCs struggle to coordinate motors that demand mismatched electrical RPM, inviting sync loss and extra heat.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L115-L123】

### Fabrication, Mechanics & Maintenance
- Shimano MT-series hydraulics arrive prefilled, but routing them through scooter stems still requires pulling the hose, bleeding afterward, and either buying the €15 EZ-MTB kit or improvising; mineral oil stand-ins like Total LHM Plus or even baby oil have worked in a pinch.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L9695-L9779】
- PETG print quality improves by moving from textured PEI to glass plates with mesh-leveling, thermal paste between bed and glass, and slower first layers; cheap Elegoo “rapid” PETG earned praise for glossy results at high speed, while Bambu-branded PETG required 260–270 °C to avoid under-extrusion on X1C printers.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L320-L383】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L970-L995】
- For G30/Blade hybrid installs, riders are machining custom 12 mm ID × 15 mm OD spacers (≈5–7 mm wide) and reusing Xiaomi torque washers to keep the motor axle centered without crushing dropouts; Happy Giraffe even offered lathed stainless shims for the community.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L1017-L1055】
- Tight rim/tube clearances on 10×2 assemblies are handled either by trimming the rim for the valve or using 90° valve stems and screw-on extensions, preventing tube damage during inflation.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L496-L509】
- Bearing longevity discussions pointed toward adding radial shaft seals (Radialwellendichtring) and swapping to better-sealed cartridges, since stock caps let water ingress after rainy rides.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L429-L808】
- Tooling advice favored real drill presses over Dremel stands for metal work—cheap flexy rigs can’t hold tolerances when drilling copper busbars or aluminum fixtures.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L880-L898】
- Frame shoppers debating Ninebot’s Max G2 learned it isn’t the steel savior they imagined: Jan and Mirono stressed that its thin sheet frame still deforms under jumps, aluminum G30 decks remain the go-to sleeper base, and the truly abuse-proof option is sourcing surplus rental SNSC frames built for fleet duty.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L8004-L8035】
- Adhesive testing for PETG pack hardware favored scuffing bond faces, wiping with alcohol, and then clamping slow-cure epoxy or polyurethane construction glue so the printed geometry—not brittle CA—carries the load on battery holders.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L3840-L3868】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L4273-L4283】
- Seating stubborn tubeless tires goes easier when you ratchet-strap the tread to push beads outward, then blast high-flow air—far beyond a 3.5 bar hobby compressor—to snap the carcass evenly before final inflation; brake-cleaner “pops” are a last resort.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L3980-L4052】
- Yamal learned that converting his split-rim hub to tubeless isn’t practical—the casting is too shallow for tubeless beads or valves, so the fix is buying the dedicated tubeless rim rather than trying to seal the stock halves.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L6983-L6999】
- PuneDir published a 47 mm Zero 10X battery spacer STL (gyroid infill at 20 %) so builders can stack taller packs without crushing the deck, while haku reminded everyone that pouch cells still need armored casings inside printed frames.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L7908-L7950】
- Gabe’s failed solder spree highlighted the gulf between bargain flux-core wire and trusted brands—Happy Giraffe swears by Stannol, while haku pointed to Towot/Kester leaded spools and regular tip cleaning to keep heavy-gauge joints flowing.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L8280-L8439】
- Haku showed off LY’s tubeless split rim with its center rubber seal and swappable 90–110 mm barrels, giving 12″ builders a modular way to adjust tire width without chasing new hubs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L8663-L8679】
- PMT tires earned praise for their rubber compound on small-diameter scooters, with riders still searching for Michelin equivalents in the same sizes.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L8772-L8774】

### Displays, Controls & Instrumentation
- Eye4 and Xiaomi dashboard retrofits remain stalled because nobody has released open firmware; would-be developers need full UART access (plus an extra wire) to repurpose the built-in Bluetooth for VESC use.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L147-L160】
- Spintend’s v3 ADC adapter now ships with proper harness connectors instead of the old screw-terminal block, so builders no longer need to crimp custom JST leads to get a tidy brake/regen hookup.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L5866-L5874】
- Happy Giraffe handles keyed kills by breaking the throttle’s 5 V feed—drop a handlebar key lock inline and the VESC stays off without adding a dedicated anti-spark switch.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L5250-L5250】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L6441-L6443】
- PuneDir adds a belt-and-suspenders safety by wiring a pull-down resistor from throttle signal to ADC1 ground so any open-circuit lever snaps to 0 V instead of needing a separate kill switch to satisfy race scrutineers.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L18973-L18979】
- Aleksandr’s Vsett display Lisp runs on dual 75100 aluminum controllers today, but early 6.05 beta firmware breaks compatibility—users should pin firmware versions before flashing if they rely on the script.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L1096-L1106】
- Running throttle signals through dash adapters introduces perceptible lag; several riders now leave the dash for speed/mode display only and wire new throttles directly into the ADC input to restore response.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L916-L924】
- Connecting twin 75100s only requires CAN-H and CAN-L; tying the 5 V rails together without a shared power button risks ground loops that kill hardware, so frustrated builders sometimes bypass the dash bridge altogether and land throttles straight on the controller ADC.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L4208-L4245】
- Carbon-fiber–filled PETG behaved like a weak conductor in community tests—even at 100–1,000 V—so treat printed mains covers as semi-conductive and add insulation when routing AC charging plugs through them.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L4228-L4297】
- G30 dash retrofits onto 75100s still hinge on adding the pull-down resistor from pin 3 while leaving the recommended capacitor optional; 6.2 firmware currently locks all three modes to ~60 % current scale, so most riders stay on older releases until the bug is patched.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L4426-L4457】
- Error 10 on Xiaomi dashboards continues to trace back to failed script uploads or bad UART comms—after reflashing, riders verified throttle channels stuck at 0 V and usually revert to direct ADC wiring if the dash refuses to talk.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L4516-L4541】
- JPPL highlighted how negative ramping time keeps scooters surging for a split-second after you release throttle; switching to the natural throttle curve trims that coasting and shrinks the dead zone.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L15497-L15499】
- When Lyss couldn’t sync an e-skate remote, Mirono pointed her to the Vedder site’s Windows VESC Tool zip, and Her0DasH reminded her that without Bluetooth she’ll need to USB each controller, re-run the full motor/battery/throttle setup after firmware updates, and expect a slow first launch of the desktop app.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L8236-L8241】

### Power Electronics & Control Strategy
- Her0DasH walked through why field weakening is an efficiency trade: advancing current vector angle squeezes the back-EMF “circle” into an ellipse that grants more headroom but costs torque, so pushing beyond the circular limit only makes sense once voltage is exhausted and riders accept softer launches.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L1286-L1294】
- Yoann’s MTPA experiments on 22×3 hub motors confirmed that cranking battery amps past ~333 A merely raised heat without increasing 120–125 km/h top speed; Mirono reiterated that hubs are Kv-limited and MTPA is better reserved for inrunners/IPM mid-drives.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L3344-L3349】
- Early Spintend 85 V/200 A controllers appear firmware-limited to 300 A phase even when higher targets are entered; veterans suggested flashing the unofficial “no-limits” build to lift the cap but warned it may void support on hardware already known to be temperamental.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L3461-L3502】
- Jason Nelson temporarily silenced his negative over-current alarms by disabling the OC fault mode, yet mentors cautioned that approach only masks regenerative back-feed and torque loss without fixing the tune that triggers it.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L3823-L3834】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L3880-L3895】
- Yamal’s 20s10p 40T pack drops roughly 10 V during 280 A bursts; firmware 6.02 offered another 20 A per controller but he kept 15 % field-weakening enabled for headroom, planning GPS runs to validate the higher ceiling.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L4751-L4753】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L5074-L5079】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L5254-L5258】
- Regen tuning on VESC dashboards still relies on mapping the brake throttle to “current no reverse” on ADC2; riders pair that with 30 motor poles, 1:1 gearing, and GPS cross-checks to sync displayed speed with reality.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L4980-L4999】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L5408-L5433】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L5849-L5853】
- Happy Giraffe walked Jacob through centered-throttle KERS setup: calibrate ADC with the wheel in the air, keep the configuration window open while sweeping the lever, then dial in brake onset and negative motor/battery current limits so regen ramps in without overstressing the pack.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L6864-L6925】
- Happy Giraffe also urged riders to stage low-voltage cutouts above the BMS’s shutdown threshold so VESC ramps power gracefully instead of face-planting when the BMS opens; Gabe paired that reminder with a warning to log motor temps so thermal limits aren’t a surprise when sag hits.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L7674-L7676】

### Motor & Controller Tuning (Raw IDs 221 575–221 648)
- Yamal confirmed his frame supplier claims to use “Happy Giraffe aluminum,” but Happy Giraffe advised against welding the controller bay; TIG/MIG beads leave tiny contact patches, so he recommends bolting the controllers straight to the heatsink with thermal paste and relying on the frame as the heat spreader.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L408102-L408511】
- Yoann is stretching dual Spintend 85/200s on a Nami with the stock 22/3 rear hub—he’s already seeing ABS over-current faults at ~515 A phase, firmware over-voltage trips, and wants to log the higher temps his stacked heatsinks and air inlets are managing before deciding whether to lift absolute max current to 500 A.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L408601-L408921】【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L408708-L408776】
- Dyno testing the single rear wheel returned 12.21 hp (14.36 kW) and a 125 km/h-plus trace; Yoann reminded the crew this drag-bike dyno simulates aerodynamic load, explains why its numbers run conservative, and highlighted that his 600 A logs come from dual-motor street pulls, whereas the dyno session was one-motor only.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L408784-L409405】【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L409018-L409127】
- He’s sharing the VESC telemetry over a TCP hub and booked another dyno slot to capture fuller data after resolving the over-voltage cutouts, keeping the group looped in for higher-power tuning comparisons.【F:data/raw/telegram_exports/vesc_help_group/input_part007.json†L409429-L409495】

### Wiring, Sensors & Diagnostics
- Finn’s melted phase leads at 170 A prompted a switch to thicker AliExpress “8-core” harnesses and a reminder to measure axle feed-through clearances before upsizing wires or swapping bearings.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L1287-L1299】
- Builders chasing flaky motor temps compared KTY vs. NTC probes; Happy Giraffe noted that VESC’s stock coefficients are reliable if the sensor reports ambient after cool-down and suggested trying the alternate KTY preset or switching to smoother 10 kΩ NTCs when readings spike negative.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L2239-L2255】
- Finn measured only 7 mm of axle bore on his hub, so the crew recommended stripping bulky jacketing, sliding each 3 mm² conductor through dedicated fiberglass sleeves, and relying on sensorless starts below 10 km/h if halls can’t be upsized—P100 hubs reportedly run clean once current, not RPM, drives saturation.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L3869-L3923】
- Chris Culver traced his smoking launch to a weakly soldered front phase lead—despite 10 AWG cabling and twin XT90s feeding a QS8, the joint overheated, reinforcing the push to redo any high-current terminations that aren’t flawless.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L4754-L4798】
- Gabe ultimately doubled up 14 AWG battery leads for his 35 A target after Happy Giraffe warned that single 14 AWG runs are marginal over longer distances and recommended stepping to 12 AWG to eliminate waste heat inside sealed decks.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L8290-L8297】
- Xiaomi front ends still lack real weather sealing: even upgraded models eat bearings unless owners add external seals or swap to premium cartridges, while the hub motors keep their own gaskets from the factory.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L4564-L4576】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L4688-L4699】
- For high-current tools like kWeld, builders favored EC8 connectors as the practical high-amp choice; QS8s handle more current but are miserable to unplug every weld cycle, while XT90s were deemed undersized for repeated spot-welder duty.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L6674-L6682】
- The AWG debate resurfaced with cihan’s Navee build: sombre_enfant pegs 12 AWG silicone at roughly 80–100 A continuous, while Gabe notes that published charts assume PVC insulation and continuous duty—short silicone harnesses can safely run hotter before resistance becomes a problem.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L17617-L17629】

### Battery Pack Engineering
- PuneDir outlined stacking dual G30 modules for 20s6p/20s8p Zero 10X conversions, with the group insisting on proper isolation—double cell wraps, fish paper, and printed spacers instead of bare hot-glued cans—to keep the dense pack serviceable.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L2752-L2819】
- The crew compared smart BMS options: LLT (now branded JBD) earned praise for compact housings, configurable temperature/charge limits, built-in Bluetooth, and gentle pre-charge that protects controller capacitors, making it a credible JK alternative when space is tight.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L3415-L3454】
- When builders needed a slim 60 A-capable 15 s BMS for dual-controller G30 conversions, Mirono pointed them to the 100 A JBD board (10–17 s variant) as the smallest smart option that still offers UART/BT telemetry.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L6028-L6033】
- PuneDir’s Zero 10X rebuild is leaning on hot glue plus fish paper instead of plastic holders for a 20s7p bank of LG M26s, leaving ventilation gaps and planning tape wraps to lock the structure once welded.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L5231-L5282】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L5512-L5520】
- Gabe’s live build log confirms that a single 0.15 mm pure-nickel strip can handle his planned 40 A draw when the bus layout is compact; Mirono still urged matching strip count to current paths instead of relying on a one-size rule, while PuneDir recommended temporary tape wraps to hold printed carriers until proper strapping arrives.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L7658-L7716】
- PuneDir estimates a Zero 10X deck can swallow roughly 200 LG M26 cells in a W layout by stacking custom holders and a 5 cm extender, but it pushes the limits on BMS placement and demands careful insulation before committing to a 20s10p rebuild.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L8552-L8557】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L8692-L8697】
- Happy Giraffe shared test curves showing Molicel P45B packs delivering more usable energy and running cooler than both P42A and Samsung 50S at 20–30 A per cell, reinforcing why riders chasing 120 A battery currents eye 45B for 4p layouts before settling for legacy chemistries.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L8053-L8071】
- While planning that pack, he floated stacking five layers of nickel strip for a 70 A discharge path, and Mirono pushed everyone to size busbars with actual cross-sectional math instead of hoping multilayer stacks match copper equivalents.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L6324-L6370】
- Gabe and haku agreed that triple-stacked 0.30 mm nickel is bulky and still resistive—switching to copper (now that the welder is fixed) is the cleaner answer for high-current packs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L15600-L15612】
- Gabe’s Xiaomi Pro 2 sleeper pack proves the deck fits 90 cells with spacers (88 installed) and even a 20s5p stack without spacers, but the BMS and controllers have to live on the deck plates to keep the cavity clear.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L15734-L15747】
- His latest iteration splits the pack 11 s internal/9 s external with twin 6 AWG feeds, stashes the controllers inside a 50 mm deck spacer, and lifts the BMS into the stem to keep the Pro 2’s stance slim while chasing 20 s power.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L16440-L16458】
- Cihan located a 10 mm-tall JBD smart BMS for tight decks and is weighing it against keeping the stock battery plus a compact Makerbase 84100HP controller to stay within the Navee bay.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L16086-L16095】
- Mounting controllers with thermal glue isn’t recommended: clamp the Makerbase 84100HP to the frame with paste, consider sanding the ridged base flat, or even expose the heatsink through the deck like Ninebot’s stock design for better dissipation.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L16088-L16105】
- Mirono reminded builders that dual-sided heatsink BMS boards still need insulation plates so the MOSFET cans don’t touch cells, even if the unit is grossly over-specced for the build.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L15824-L15837】
- PuneDir now layers epoxy sheet, plexiglass, fishpaper, and polycarbonate around frame-mounted packs so vibration can’t chafe nickel or balance leads once the battery becomes part of the chassis.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L17757-L17759】
- Mirono steered would-be spot welders toward Docreate’s capacitor unit (~€100) after haku noted Arduino-style welders only manage 0.10 mm nickel; LSUC-branded capacitors were panned compared with proven alternatives.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L15920-L15972】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L15958-L15960】
- Deadword’s machinist toolkit—mag-base dial indicator stands and CNC edge finders—sparked a reminder that aligning hubs and rotors with measuring tools beats eyeballing, even if rubber tires mask some runout.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L15787-L15820】
- Gabe and sombre_enfant reiterated that pure copper strip alone rarely survives pull tests—lay copper first, cap it with nickel, and tune weld energy (≈40 J for nickel, 60–70 J for copper) so the joint tears metal instead of popping off, even if that means stacking multiple 0.15 mm layers.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L6124-L6148】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L6791-L6792】
- PuneDir is over-building insulation on his Zero 10X pack—taping between nickel layers, triple heat-shrinking with silicone-sealed exits, and planning plexiglass channels for balance leads—to keep 20s harnesses from chafing through in wet decks.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L6525-L6533】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L6804-L6805】
- His optimism in JK smart BMS hardware took a hit when a unit bricked itself on the bench—the board froze as soon as he opened the discharge page in the app, yet pack voltages still read fine—so veterans pointed him to the ongoing failure thread and encouraged prepping the harness for a JBD swap if repair fails.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L6728-L6761】
- Active-balancing expectations needed calibration: JK’s shuttle stage only moves about 600 mA between cell groups, whereas passive boards waste excess energy as heat through resistors, so builders should decide if the extra complexity is worth it before reordering hardware.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L6769-L6777】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L6782-L6783】
- Happy Giraffe recommended stopping routine charges around 90 %—provided the BMS can still balance at that voltage—to quadruple pack longevity for commuters instead of living at 100 %.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L6807-L6816】
- Sombre_enfant’s material checklist prompted a refresher on layer order: Mirono pairs kapton with fishpaper for corner work, keeps fishpaper as the pack-wide isolation layer, and caps everything with fiberglass or epoxy sheet plus plexi cutouts where extra clearance is needed.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L7765-L7771】
- Dyson pack scroungers confirmed that pre-production Molicel P50B cans out-muscle P45B cells and that vacuum modules mix 20700, 21700, and even 18650 formats depending on model, which matters when reconfiguring the salvage into scooter banks.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L6870-L6876】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L6912-L6917】
- Building on that, Gabe’s teardown of V8 modules shows they’re 6 s 1 p Molicels with BMS faults that often clear after reflashing via Pickit 3; he walks through releasing the enclosure’s hidden pins, verifying healthy cells, and rewelding before closing the case.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L7406-L7442】
- Konstantin warned that Dyson’s smart BMS frequently “soft-locks” after current faults; clearing it demands reflashing the PIC with a Pickit 3 to wipe EEPROM flags before the pack will discharge again.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L6918-L6946】
- Samsung 50E packs continue to divide the group: Yoann’s four-year-old Weped FS with an ANT BMS still peaks 240 A with minimal sag and >10 000 km of service, yet others argue the chemistry is best reserved for ultra-high-parallel builds while 40T/P42A remain the safer high-amp choice.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L5411-L5449】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L5536-L5547】

### Fabrication & Shop Practice
- Happy Giraffe’s drilling playbook—start with a pilot bit just larger than the chisel edge, use cutting fluid, and chase threads with tapping grease—helped haku plan precise M6 patterns without a full machine shop; spring punches can re-center holes if the pilot wanders.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L1621-L1663】
- Cheap 180×300 mm hobby lathes handle soft aluminum at best; for steel, the group recommends hunting heavier used machines and checking that home wiring can feed welders or lathe motors without tripping breakers.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L1668-L1685】
- When resealing Ninebot hub motors, stick with neutral-cure RTV (Ali 704/705) instead of acidic silicones so the gasketed IP67 shells stay watertight without corroding the stator laminations.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L1837-L1850】
- Izuna’s drowned dual-VESC setup underlines why tear-downs need immediate resealing—once the factory RTV is peeled back, even one rainy commute can short rear controllers unless everything is re-epoxied before riding again.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L4462-L4486】
- The crew doubled down on proper crimping: hydraulic lug tools that cold-flow copper beat solder for conductivity and strain relief, though some builders still tin leads before the crimp; budget presses run ~€60 and routinely survive body-weight pull tests.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L4700-L4746】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L4723-L4729】
- Makerbase’s new 84 V “84200HP/84100HP” VESCs look tempting on price yet draw criticism for sideways heat-sink screws that choke airflow—owners expect to add thermal pads or custom housings before pushing them hard.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L5098-L5105】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L5755-L5775】
- Her0DasH warned that clamping bare copper heatsinks directly to aluminum frames invites galvanic corrosion; isolate with silicone sheets or nickel plating if you mix metals so the thermal upgrade doesn’t eat the chassis.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L10825-L10858】

### Controller Hardware Maintenance
- Makerbase’s engineers opened an esk8.news thread for the 84 V/200 A INA241-based board, actively gathering community feedback on layout tweaks and firmware before launch, which bodes well for long-term support of the higher-voltage lineup.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L8633-L8635】
- Asyan4ik’s FlipSky 75100 aluminum-case controller lost its MCU without warning even though bus rails looked normal; he sourced a $30 replacement STM chip and swapped it in under an hour, a reminder to stock spare logic ICs for older boards.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L10517-L10528】

### Chassis Geometry & Handling
- Sombre_enfant confirmed that Lonnyo 70 H and 75 H hubs share axles and shells—only a couple millimeters larger than 60 H—so they squeeze into G30 forks, but feeding them usually forces at least a 5 p deck pack and leaves little room for 90 H experiments.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L9450-L9475】
- Ninebot F2 Pro owners hunting for better brakes must adapt from the scooter’s odd 51 mm post-mount and five-bolt rotor pattern; the crew recommended sturdier PS-to-PS adapters (not Monorim’s soft aluminum version) and stepping up to 140 mm rotors when stacking adapters to maintain pad contact.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L11114-L11166】
- Kirill shared diagrams contrasting positive vs. negative trail on popular scooters: girder forks such as Wolf King GT gain trail under sag, while some inverted designs can cross into negative trail mid-travel, demanding dampers to mask self-flip tendencies; the target is a consistently positive trail that self-stabilizes like motorcycle telelever setups.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L3171-L3183】
- Her0DasH warned that Ninebot’s tubular-frame lines (F-series, Mi 3/4, kid models) pack the BMS and ESC on one throwaway board, chew through bearings, rely on epoxy neck joints, and cram wiring so tightly that dust infiltrates hubs—fine for grocery runs but painful platforms for heavy mods.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L11181-L11223】
- Yoann’s Spintend 85/200 + 70H builds are finally smoothing out: the pack needed cycling before voltage sag behaved, 40 A of field weakening keeps GPS and wheel-speed within ~5–8 km/h, and new-gen Lonnyo hubs route phases through the side cap instead of the axle, which frees room for larger sleeved leads after widening Burn-E dropouts—plus they’re the only split rims he’s seen that ship tubeless-ready, whereas older axle-exit versions stay tube-bound.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L5427-L5505】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L5473-L5489】
- Tommy flagged that Xiaomi’s Mi 3 Lite/4 generation no longer comes from Ninebot, so the frames are flimsier, software is locked down, and even rear tire changes mean opening the deck from the top—voiding warranty—while the Pro2/Pro3 remain the mod-friendly baseline.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L6203-L6209】
- Sombre_enfant shared the bespoke Thunder build credited to Beni Stern—a dual 90H monster estimated near 50 kW—highlighting how custom frames, titanium steering tubes, and a 20s10p 40T battery push far beyond production scooter packaging limits.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L8517-L8528】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L8770-L8776】
- Yamal priced LY’s latest hub motors around €800 and confirmed the 70 H variant still fits most 11″ chassis, giving builders a drop-in upgrade path while they evaluate the newer 90 H customs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L8680-L8686】
- PuneDir is eyeing Makerbase’s 84100HP to replace repeatedly failing Zero ESCs, underscoring the appetite for sturdier mid-tier controllers in those housings.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L7975-L7979】
- Happy Giraffe and sombre_enfant reminded builders that narrow 620 mm handlebars feel twitchy at speed—taller riders happily stretch Zero/Xiaomi bars to 700–800 mm, but the extra leverage punishes flimsy stems, so plan reinforcements when extending poles.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L16320-L16344】
- Gabe is reworking a Xiaomi Pro 2 around JREV’s front suspension kit on the rear swingarm so an 11″ torque hub clears, stacking steel shims and relocating the BMS into the stem spacer to keep the deck slim.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L16441-L16458】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L16491-L16500】
- Dropping 60 H hubs into a G30 is largely bolt-on if you mount from the inside and shim with steel if needed; M365 frames don’t have the clearance, and even 65 H works only at the rear with careful packaging.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L16505-L16529】
- Jan reiterated that only a few production scooters nail trail geometry—Segway GT1/GT2 and Inmotion RS top the list—while most C-fork builds wobble because designers chase looks instead of preserving positive trail and neck stiffness.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L16629-L16708】
- Кирилл confirmed Inmotion’s RS keeps healthy trail even in the lowered stance, whereas newer Dualtron frames feel sketchy above 30–40 km/h without geometry changes.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L16832-L16844】
- Her0DasH’s Kaabo Mantis teardown found the folding neck twisting under side loads and the charge port literally glued in—strip the neck, thread-lock every axle, and clock the latch so the thick casting resists the fold direction.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L17055-L17073】
- NetworkDir cautioned that upsizing tyres on already marginal trail (like PuneDir’s Zero) only makes wobble worse; fix the geometry before chasing 11″ conversions.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L17127-L17151】

### Software & Tooling
- Lyss’ dual-VESC skateboard troubleshooting is a reminder that the Windows VESC Tool lives behind a registered VESC Project account, each controller needs its own USB (or BLE) session before firmware updates, and flashing will wipe prior setup—so capture motor, battery, and throttle parameters first.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L8236-L8241】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L8297-L8304】
- Tommy noted that kawaiinekololis’ latest FlipSky firmware now maps ADC throttles across the full 0–3.3 V range instead of 0–1 V, making high-duty control far smoother on Izuna 75100 builds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L11309-L11313】
- Deadword confirmed the open-source G30 dash project lets a Makerbase 75100 route throttle and brake through the display harness—exactly as designed—so long as the dash stays powered from the VESC.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L16339-L16387】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L17376-L17379】
- NetworkDir reminded Vsett 10+ owners that the AK display script fails on firmware 6.02; beta 6.05 or newer (beta 15 worked, beta 28 didn’t) restores CAN control, though the script currently rewrites the app mode to “No App” on every reboot and wipes ADC throttle settings.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L17718-L17764】
- Marko’s workaround for keeping the stock Vsett thumb throttle was to slide the hall sensor away from the magnet until wide-open output hits 3.3 V, while others suggested using a 5 V thumb throttle with a resistor divider; the crew likes the dedicated ADC module for its noise filtering when you can’t get a native 3.3 V lever.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L17732-L17749】
- Thierry flagged that Spintend’s Ubox 85_250 firmware is still missing from VESC Tool—builders have to compile it themselves, fix lingering header typos in Vedder’s repo, and many fall back to a known-good 6.05 beta because 6.02 currently throws build errors.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L17801-L17803】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L17922-L17948】
- NetworkDir confirmed that Makerbase’s 80100 hardware only delivers the advertised 250 A phase once you flash a no-hardware-limit build; the stock limited firmware tops out near 150–160 A even with ample cooling.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L18332-L18333】
- Yoann’s Raspberry Pi VESC display project now ships with a TCP bridge because the Pi Zero’s UART pins are consumed by the touchscreen; dropping the baud to 9,600 temporarily fixed timeouts, but he had to plug in over USB to restore the original speed and plans to publish a shared 3D case alongside Mark’s repo.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L17912-L17919】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L18304-L18310】

### Controller Troubleshooting & Firmware (Lines 11 800–13 299)
- PuneDir’s Makerbase 75100 V2 started cogging after hall removal until Tommy walked through the fix: strip the stacked shunt resistors down to one per phase, flash the 0.0005 Ω firmware (or fall back to the 75_300_r2 v5.1 build), and rerun detection around 10 A with the Ortega observer to keep it in stable sensorless mode.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L11822-L11870】
- The same scooter later lost one phase from a dead current-sense op-amp; PuneDir swapped the B-phase amp, its gate driver, and all MOSFETs for 214 A parts while adding the new ignition-cut trace so the repaired 75100 spun cleanly again.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L12182-L12259】
- Mixing Makerbase 75100s with FlipSky 75100s on a shared CAN line is a no-go—their termination values differ enough to pop the transceivers (MCP2551 on MKS vs. SIT103T on FlipSky), so stick to homogeneous pairs or rework the resistor network before linking them.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L12281-L12359】
- Gabe’s overheating VESC on a Xiaomi build traced back to shrink-wrap sealing the baseplate; Her0DasH reminded him that taped boxes trap heat, so leave bolted paths or ventilation for the aluminum case to shed temperature before chasing firmware fixes.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L12503-L12529】
- VESC Tool’s state-of-charge gauge simply interpolates 4.2–3.3 V per cell (0 % ≈ 66 V on 20 s), so Jason dialed his cutoff a bit above the BMS threshold to avoid throttling surprises once the display reads “empty.”【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L12863-L12882】
- Mirono relayed a 3shul CL-series failure story, but Kirill and Happy Giraffe stressed that the platform stays reliable only when you hand-tune motor and brake currents—auto-detected regen mirrors drive amps and will spike hardware unless you rein it in, so VESC newcomers should expect a full manual setup or choose simpler controllers like Nucular/FarDriver instead.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L12289-L12331】

### Powertrain & Battery Packaging (Lines 11 800–13 299)
- NetworkDir proved a 20s5p 18650 pack can live inside a Zero 10X deck without spacers by copying the stock 14s7p layout, then layered another 4p bag (headed toward 20s16p) while PuneDir’s photos showed the 7p deck core plus external extensions for the remaining parallel groups.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L11934-L11939】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L12642-L12646】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L12721-L12747】
- Aspilsan A28 pulls caught the group’s attention: roughly €180 bought 240 low-cycle cells with ~16 mΩ IR that stay cool at 15 A continuous/25 A pulse, and the crew credits the Turkish supplier’s military pedigree for the consistent performance.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L11964-L11965】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L12663-L12674】
- Mirono shut down the idea of bypass-charging a smart BMS to “auto-balance” a pack—parallel voltages don’t divide evenly, so you’ll just overcharge the highest cells and risk a fire.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L11962-L11976】
- Pure Kapton wraps still need structural insulation; Mirono’s experience is that they tear easily unless you back them with fishpaper or clamp the stack mechanically.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L12376-L12380】
- Jason suggested hanging oversized battery bags from the swingarm instead of the folding joint so the mechanism isn’t carrying the extra mass—fab a small shelf off the arm to drop the weight safely.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L12844-L12846】
- Gabe and Happy Giraffe’s battery storage chat underscored that loose cells age even in boxes—unless you stash them around 3.3 V in a cold spot, expect capacity loss—so only hoard cheap finds like $2 Samsung 30Ts when you can actually rotate them into builds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L13008-L13029】

### Battery Architecture & Power Delivery Updates (Lines 17 800–19 299)
- Alin sized the P42A/40T packs he services at roughly 170–180 A continuous for 5 p builds and warned that a 325 A-rated smart BMS is undersized once you stretch to 10 p—especially after that client blew up two JK boards in the same spot.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L18322-L18328】
- PuneDir’s 20s11p commuter only returns 55–60 km when cruising 80–90 km/h at 90 kg, pulling ~28.6 A from the pack—useful real-world range data for similar speed-focused builds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L18121-L18130】
- Waterproofing the Zero conversions means potting the VESC in resin and shrink-wrapping the pack; even the harder compounds can be boiled loose later, so riders can service electronics without grinding the enclosure apart.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L18962-L18970】

### Geometry & Stability Updates (Lines 11 800–13 299)
- PuneDir’s 75 km/h tank slappers on a Zero prompted Kirill to flag C-arm trail issues—lengthen trail instead of masking it with more dampers, and study Inmotion RS or the MotoChassis steering primer for target geometry before pushing further.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L12892-L12905】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L13274-L13280】

### Geometry & Stability Updates (Lines 17 800–19 299)
- Zero riders chasing 12″ top-speed builds reported the stock suspension bottoming and connector hardware cooking—PuneDir melted MT60s at 180 A phase and now follows Sombre_enfant’s advice to swap in EXA 291R 2,000 lb shocks while logging the 12″ tires pushing 120–130 km/h off-throttle.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L19069-L19069】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L19120-L19123】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L19171-L19179】
- NetworkDir cataloged the hard numbers for Zero shock sizing: stock decks accept roughly 165 mm/135 mm dampers, and he now runs a 165 mm 2,000 lb rear with a 145 mm 1,500 lb front to restore trail and stability at race pace.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L19186-L19198】

### Fabrication & Pack Building (Lines 13 300–14 799)
- Haku’s 801D experiments confirmed that copper busbars only weld reliably when you tack 0.2 mm nickel-plated steel over 0.2 mm copper—the steel cap doesn’t need to carry current, it just keeps the nugget consistent so pure copper strips stop popping loose.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L13595-L13617】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L13620-L13678】
- Gabe followed up with 0.10 mm copper plus 0.15 mm nickel, noting that pre-welding both layers at once alloys the interface and avoids the weak joints you get when you add nickel later.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L13835-L13836】

### Fabrication & Pack Building Updates (Lines 16 300–17 799)
- Gabe’s 801D tuning on 0.10 mm copper plus 0.15 mm nickel landed around 93–96 power—strong enough to tear surrounding copper while 85 still rips free and 99 starts punching holes—giving builders a starting point for sandwich welds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L16811-L16821】
- Haku recommends curved metal snips and printable templates (or even cardboard) to pre-cut copper overlays; lighter PETG prints make it easier to see cell outlines before trimming.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L16824-L16905】
- Practice runs showed that pressing the electrodes too hard on used cells weakens welds—Gabe switched to flush cutters to clear old nickel bumps and backed off pressure to get consistent pull tests.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L17117-L17124】

### Controllers & Electronics (Lines 13 300–14 799)
- Makerbase/FlipSky throttles that float when unplugged need a 3.3 kΩ pull-down on ADC 1; Jason’s scooter only read the trigger again after wiring directly to the controller, confirming the harness had opened up during repairs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L13799-L13819】
- Happy Giraffe reminded newcomers that motor current is typically ~2.5× battery current, and to log GPS alongside VESC data while dialing wheel diameter—Zero 10X owners land near 250 mm because a “10 inch” hub really measures ~254 mm unloaded and squats under weight.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L13842-L13849】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L13870-L13874】
- NetworkDir caps motor-detection current around 20–30 A on big hubs to stop the “bam bam” slam during calibration, then raises operating phase amps once detection finishes cleanly.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L14053-L14054】
- Spintend remains the crew’s pick for Vsett 10+ conversions that need Bluetooth profile switching; builders contrasted it with Zero 10X hardware and called out Vsett’s larger deck, custom suspension, and improved clamp and stem for packing bigger batteries.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L14058-L14061】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L14109-L14116】
- PuneDir and NetworkDir ported the Simple VESC Display code to a €9 ESP32 panel: the touch screen now mirrors VESC Tool over BLE/Wi‑Fi, refreshes telemetry every 10 ms, serves a more stable odometer than 6.05 firmware, and stays readable in sun while CAN remains free by riding over UART.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L13749-L13749】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L14170-L14196】
- Rage Mechanics is shipping its new display only with controllers until CE certification finishes; Francois confirmed EU integrators demand compliance and teased a companion anti-theft module that hooks into VESC or any controller over 4/5G phone links.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L14141-L14166】
- iOS users discovered that VESC Tool locks configuration fields on 6.05 firmware unless you install the beta or the paid App Store build—without it, BLE sessions show read-only values.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L14374-L14394】
- JK’s silver 8 p BMSes continue to self-immolate at the same PCB corner (even while idle); PuneDir and NetworkDir told everyone to shelve them immediately after another spontaneous burn.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L14663-L14670】
- If you reset a JK pack and can’t reconnect, long-press the BMS button to reboot it—the Wi-Fi password reverts to `1234` regardless of what you set previously.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L14538-L14541】
- PuneDir still trims Makerbase 75100 current readings by physically removing two of the parallel shunts so VESC sees the proper sense value after repairs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L14570-L14570】
- When hall sensors die mid-ride, the crew runs the Zero sensorless by dropping open-loop ERPM to 0 and swapping to the Mxlemming observer with BEMF decoupling for smoother starts.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L14699-L14721】
- Recovering a bricked CAN chain can be as simple as changing the VESC ID and reflashing the bootloader over the remaining CAN link; that brought PuneDir’s networked controllers back online.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L14699-L14706】
- Deadword’s G30/75100 build highlighted fresh setup pitfalls: run the motor wizard, stay on Ortega with BEMF decoupling, keep hall sensors enabled so the dash reports speed, and watch for “limited mode” if firmware versions on the VESC Tool and controller don’t match—power-cycling cleared it once the right firmware was loaded.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L17305-L17333】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L17363-L17375】

### Brakes, Frames & Field Reliability (Lines 13 300–14 799)
- Nutt Y5 calipers aren’t plug-and-play on Ninebot F2 Pros: Xiaomi’s hall-brake signal needs a resistor ladder to mimic analog e-brake levels, and the chassis sticks with 5-bolt rotors—upgraded options include a thicker 120 mm disc and Monorim’s 140 mm 5-hole rotor if you add the proper adapter.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L13899-L13922】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L14113-L14116】
- PuneDir’s post-crash wheel wobble reminded everyone to balance scooter hubs like motorcycle rims—add weight opposite the high spot and inspect for permanent deformation if a car clipped the shell, because a bent casting rarely true-outs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L14102-L14108】
- Spanish members reported that cheap Xiaomi clones still ship with flimsy 110 mm rotors, bargain electronics, and even sparked two Aovo house fires; regulators now ban uncertified scooters from 2024 onward, forcing riders onto plated, government-approved models such as the Xiaomi 4 series by 2027.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L13940-L13959】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L13945-L13946】
- Chain-drive builds stay noisy even with fresh parts, but Her0DasH still recommends renewing chain, sprockets, and using sealed 6002 2RS bearings—6000-series clones and belt swaps wear out fast under 140 kg loads, and rear wheels take the brunt because heavy frames can’t bunny-hop potholes the way light M365s can.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L14726-L14752】

### Brakes, Frames & Field Reliability (Lines 14 800–16 299)
- Gabe’s 11" PMT conversion on a Xiaomi Pro 2 only clears by limiting suspension travel, so the trick is reserved for lightweight riders willing to trade comfort for tire width.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L14985-L14989】
- NetworkDir keeps snapping Zero swingarms and now favors the beefier rental SNSC fork, which still needs cutting and pressing but is cheaper and stronger than custom CNC replacements in Turkey.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L15338-L15349】
- Cihan traced his Ninebot F2 Pro’s jerky braking to ~2.5 mm of slop in the steering column above the wheel—rotor runout was only 0.1 mm—so smoothing the brake feel likely requires bracing that front casting, not just rotor work.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L15734-L15743】
- Jan reiterated why the G30 remains the go-to chassis: the rental-grade frame survives 136 km/h track abuse, and its deck can swallow roughly 120 21700 cells when builders need more than the Navee or Vsett bays offer.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L16040-L16056】
- Cihan’s brake testing showed even budget 120 mm mechanical discs can lock a small front wheel, but Happy Giraffe still prefers hydraulics because they retain modulation in wet weather and cables can freeze solid at −25 °C.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L16224-L16236】

### Market & Race Watch (Lines 17 800–19 299)
- Yamal spotted the Weped Sonic landing in Portugal and expects it to ship with Fardriver FOC hardware, making it a nearby testbed for those comparing premium non-VESC race controllers.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L19151-L19155】

### Market & Race Watch (Lines 20 800–21 537)
- Yamal’s race recap praised the Miniwalker for straight-line pace and highlighted how a well-trained rider can offset smaller batteries on short circuits, reinforcing that race prep and familiarity matter as much as raw watt-hours.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L21409-L21413】

### Raw IDs 223,189–224,880 Updates (Lines 1–1,500 of `input_part008.txt`)

#### Motor, Controller & Traction Notes
- PuneDir confirmed stock Laotie harnesses overheat while Mirono pegged QS273 hubs at roughly 7 AWG phase leads, underscoring the need to upsize cabling before pushing high phase amps.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L7-L12】
- Gabe and Mirono agreed that 70 H Lonnyo/Laotie hubs still want 12‑FET Spintend 85/200 controllers—80100 hardware saturates around 150 A phase, particularly on 33×2 windings meant for speed rather than torque.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L338-L356】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L372-L374】
- Paolo highlighted that Spintend’s 85 250 stays below 30 °C in his experience while Tronic x12 remains the race-tier choice, and he reiterated how Trampa’s older 100/250 boards cooked pads when run at sustained high current.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L650-L654】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L1621-L1625】
- NetworkDir and Konstantin cautioned that sudden BMS cutoffs still nuke most VESCs—including Makerbase’s 84/200 HP—whereas 3Shul CL350 and some Ubox hardware survive; they recommend capping CL350 voltage near 28 s and remembering Flipsky 75200s only tolerate 23 s with gentle regen.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L688-L708】
- Paolo’s scooter MTPA tests delivered short-lived torque peaks but he warned not to enable the algorithm without controller headroom; running at the limit risks burning boards.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L566-L574】
- Haku and sombre_enfant measured Vsett 11 dropouts at ~145 mm front/170 mm rear, enough for 70/90 H swaps, while noting the stock Huameng stators and lack of halls complicate low-speed launches on sensorless builds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L1160-L1178】
- PuneDir’s dual Makerbase 84100 HP Wolf conversion now overpowers front grip at 50–55 km/h; the crew suggested lowering front phase current and upgrading from Xuancheng slicks to CST or PMT race compounds before trusting VESC traction control.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L1425-L1452】
- PuneDir’s damage log shows recurring Makerbase fatalities—75100s died from hall shorts and melted motor leads, and the new 84100 HP failed mid-ride even without a BMS cutoff—keeping hall isolation diodes and strain relief on the to-do list.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L160-L162】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L1493-L1500】
- Yoann’s Spintend Spiny 2 triggered full regen on throttle release after months of stability; he captured a 10 km/h log for analysis and had just tightened hardware after the front motor shed its bolts, pointing to both firmware and mechanical checks.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L902-L905】
- GABE reported a rain-induced crash when a freshly adjusted front brake locked, reinforcing the practice of testing aggressive braking changes close to home and balancing regen versus mechanical force in wet weather.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L582-L586】

#### Battery, BMS & Thermal Findings
- PuneDir still trusts 200 A JK/ANT boards on 70 A packs, and Mirono noted nickel striping remains adequate for 20 s 20 p layouts when cells stay near 5 A each—copper only becomes essential once layouts or current demand exceed nickel’s limits.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L14-L20】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L35-L38】
- Zero 10X builders squeezed 20 s 7 p packs plus twin ESCs into decks by adding 45 mm spacers, while G30 owners can hide 18 s 5 p internally; foam or silicone isolation thicker than ~0.5 mm invites cell movement inside holderless packs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L168-L219】
- Gabe’s weld trials showed nickel popping off Molicel P42A cans even though the same settings grip LG MH1s, underscoring the need for copper-clad busbars or higher weld energy on high-drain chemistries.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L426-L433】
- Alin shared a side-mounted 20 s 7 p P42A pack using ANT’s 240 A/600 A smart BMS (about 1.8 mm thick and 70–73 mm wide), proving the board fits alongside controllers on Vsett builds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L489-L503】
- Paolo priced Wellgo nickel-copper laminates at roughly $150 shipped for a 20 s 10 p pack and confirmed they solder to nickel after welding, letting builders stiffen busbars without heating cells directly.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L742-L763】
- Yamal’s external-controller Nami project now uses a large AliExpress heatsink and keeps temps “normal” once electronics live outside the deck, though circuit sessions still set his VESC thermal key.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L125-L143】
- The crew echoed PC habits: refresh thermal paste every couple of years with compounds like Noctua NT‑H2 and clean surfaces with 99 % isopropyl before reassembly to maintain controller heat transfer.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L166-L255】
- Soldering big cables still demands 200–250 W irons or torches—100 W stations struggle with QS8 and 6 AWG—and cutting 3 mm aluminum plates works best with saw blades lubed by wax or WD‑40 instead of clog-prone grinders.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L882-L941】
- Happy Giraffe’s Bafang cleanup walkthrough suggested blowing out dust first, then using brake cleaner or alcohol sparingly with cotton rags (not microfiber) to remove contaminants like Nivea cream without stripping winding enamel.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L977-L1007】

#### Chassis, Components & Sourcing
- Yamal compared suspension styles after logging time on Dualtron Thunder and Nami: hydraulic dampers deliver comfort, elastomer stacks keep scooters planted at high speed, and he’s eyeing Bronco’s Xtreme 11 chassis as another mod-friendly platform.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L1224-L1243】
- Spanish builders continue stuffing 24 s packs, Kelly 7218 controllers, and 75 H hubs into Dualtron-style frames by reshaping decks and mounting PMT T41 slicks—evidence that clone chassis can house big power with careful fabrication.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L1256-L1289】
- Finn’s Blade (50 H) hub retrofit ships with heavier phase wires and a temperature sensor, giving Xiaomi/Zero-class scooters better telemetry and current handling out of the box.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L1040-L1053】
- NetworkDir cautioned that some AliExpress swingarms arrive with painted bearings and damaged threads, so plan on swapping bearings, cleaning threads, or filing disputes when sourcing Kaabo/Vsett hardware online.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L1018-L1034】
- Tire debates continued: Xuancheng slicks drew criticism for grip, with Paolo and NetworkDir pushing riders toward CST 11×3.5 or PMT Stradale rubber when budgets allow, while Yamal vouched for Xuancheng’s 11″ Stradale clone as a stopgap.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L1434-L1452】

#### Firmware, Displays & Incidents
- Ion’s 13 s charger desoldered a diode mid-charge, prompting reminders to check more than solder joints when refurbishing power supplies and to note that newer ADC boards dropped screw terminals for plug harnesses.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L560-L564】
- NetworkDir pointed Rogerio to the `MKSESC_84_200_HP` firmware buried in VESC Tool beta 6.05 after repeated cogging on Makerbase’s new 84/200, recommending firmware refreshes, fresh detections, and phase inspections before condemning hardware.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L511-L533】
- Happy Giraffe is hunting compact dashboards; PuneDir offered 0.96″ OLED and ST7789 Arduino modules that already work as minimalist VESC displays for speed, temps, and charge data.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L51-L105】
- Builders reminded Vsett owners that hall sensors mainly aid square-wave starts—FOC runs fine sensorless but needs a push—and that shared 5 V/ground rails mean throttle and regen wiring must be planned carefully when splitting signals between dual controllers.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L540-L579】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L1124-L1138】
- PuneDir finished another Zero rebuild with dual 84100 HPs tucked under the Wolf deck, but he’s now disputing AliExpress swingarm parts, juggling traction-control tuning, and logging yet another controller failure—evidence that cable strain relief, hall protection, and tire choice remain critical.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L1380-L1407】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L1425-L1500】

### Raw IDs 224 881–226 644 Updates (Lines 1 501–3 000 of `input_part008.txt`)

#### Motor, Controller & Safety Notes
- PuneDir cataloged three fresh Makerbase casualties—one 75100 ALU PCB shorted after a hall harness failure, another 75100 cooked when a motor lead melted, and a nearly new 84100 HP died without warning—highlighting how fragile these controllers stay without proper hall insulation and strain relief.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L1501-L1576】
- Yoann’s Spinny V2 throttle arrived with its power lead half cut and the blue signal ripped free, and he warned that enabling e-brake with a damaged harness can trigger sudden full-power regen; the crew wants firmware failsafes that sanity-check throttle voltage swings before applying braking torque.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L1604-L1613】
- NetworkDir and Happy Giraffe shared a quick hall diagnostic: feed the sensor board 5 V and ground, then watch resistance or voltage jump on each signal wire as you sweep a magnet or spin the wheel—an easy bench test before reinstalling motors.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L1683-L1708】
- QS138 mid-drive plans reminded everyone that these motors routinely see ~600–800 A phase and ~250 A battery draw, so builds need high-discharge cells, thick cabling, and controllers far beyond shunt-modded 75100s if they expect to hit the advertised 30–40 kW output.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L2130-L2187】
- Spintend 85/250 owners confirmed firmware will let phase limits climb toward 300 A, but Yoann’s track tests showed their custom hub prefers ~280 A for reliability even though spikes over 400 A are possible; Paolo and Yamal also debated 22 s versus 24 s packs, concluding that higher voltage adds speed but raises controller thermal load unless the hardware scales up.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L2755-L2995】

#### Battery Architecture & BMS Debugging
- Gabe’s BMS scare underscored the basics: verify pack voltage at the main leads, confirm each balance pin steps up 3.5 V at a time, solder B‑ before the harness, and recheck polarity—he miswired the negative sense pair, likely cooking resistors, and needed to reopen the ANT board for inspection.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L1980-L2055】
- His 20s8p Molicel build for a Xiaomi Pro 2 also shows the packaging extremes—splitting internal and external modules, printing 35–36 mm spacers, rerouting phase cables, and trimming foam so dual controllers and the pack can coexist without sacrificing ground clearance.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L1937-L1999】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L2344-L2383】
- PuneDir’s ebike project drove home that chasing 20s20p with bargain LG M26 cells quickly runs into space and sag limits; the group pushed him toward higher-discharge 21700s like Lishen LR or Molicel P45B so smaller 20s10–12p packs can feed QS-class motors without collapsing voltage.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L2101-L2233】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L2391-L2396】
- Lisa confirmed EVE’s 40PL high-power cells are finally shipping direct from the factory for about $4.35 each (minimum 50 units) but warned that freight and taxes erase the savings unless buyers commit to true bulk orders.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L2681-L2707】
- Sombre_enfant’s hall-board repair kept the stock fishpaper backing and added 704 silicone under the PCB, illustrating how to insulate refurbished Xiaomi motors once hall leads are resoldered and tested.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L2794-L2813】

#### Chassis, Brakes & Fabrication
- PuneDir’s “PuneRon” hybrid (a 60 kg Hyosung RX125 frame headed for QS138 power) now sports trimmed and repainted tubing, welded reinforcements, and freshly painted rims, but even he plans to hand the frame to a professional welder after practicing stick welds—proof that heavy builds need proper jigs, brake upgrades, and motor mounts before seeing pavement.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L1898-L2089】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L2353-L2473】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L2657-L2680】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L2928-L2953】
- Simone showed that fitting 70 H hubs and 3 mm brake rotors into mixed Nami/Rion forks required machining the fork legs for clearance, a reminder that custom front ends still need lathe time to seat oversize hardware safely.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L2592-L2599】
- Face de Pin Sucé previewed a race-ready scooter running 22s11p packs, a C350 controller, Hope Tech 4 V4 brakes, and in-house rewound motors—evidence that pro teams are leaning on bespoke drivetrains rather than off-the-shelf hubs for the 2024 season.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L2483-L2493】

#### Accessories, Displays & Lighting
- Mihail is prototyping an LVGL-based VESC dashboard that talks over CAN, lets riders edit profiles on-screen, and repurposes salvaged 480×320 IPS touch modules (wired through ESP32-S3 boards) that his employer scrapped—handy hardware for future community display projects.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L2501-L2587】
- Lighting chatter settled on budget 72 V bars: Happy Giraffe still leans toward direct-pack LED modules to avoid big DC/DC converters, while Haku shared an $6.83 8″ bar link and noted that the cheaper 15–18 W versions barely beat stock lamps, so mounting angle and beam pattern matter as much as raw wattage.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part008.txt†L2718-L2747】

## Follow-ups
- Consolidate the ABS over-current troubleshooting steps (observer choice, inductance tweaks, slow-ABS disablement) into a quick-reference guide for high-power Ubox/Flipsky setups.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L413-L850】

- Draft a concise explainer on when to deploy field weakening/MTPA on scooters, emphasizing the hub-motor limits the group reported so new tuners don’t chase speed with unnecessary heat.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L1286-L1294】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L3344-L3349】
- Compare LLT/JBD vs. JK smart BMS setups (features, wiring diagrams, space claims) to guide builders choosing electronics for 20s packs in cramped decks.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L3415-L3454】
- Turn Kirill’s trail visuals into a reference sheet that maps suspension geometry to handling traits for common frames (Zero, Wolf King GT, Inmotion RS, etc.).【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L3171-L3183】
- Capture a clean dual-75100 wiring diagram that shows CAN-only linking, shared power-button requirements, and when to bypass the G30 dash UART bridge to avoid ground loops.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L4208-L4245】
- Verify carbon-fiber PETG resistivity across the voltages builders use so enclosure guidance can move from anecdotal to measured safety data.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L4228-L4297】
- Document the exact G30 dash resistor/firmware combination that avoids the 60 % current cap and reduces Error 10 incidents, ideally with an updated schematic that fixes today’s ambiguous pin numbering.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L4426-L4457】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L4516-L4541】
- Summarize best practices for weather-sealing reopened controller bays so riders like Izuna can reseal hardware quickly without trapping moisture or losing serviceability.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part007.txt†L4462-L4486】
