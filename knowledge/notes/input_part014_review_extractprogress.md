| Date | Lines Covered | Key Actions | Processed Files Updated |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2025-11-11 | 1-100 (refresh) | Revisited instrumentation accuracy, heavy-hub controller limits, and thermal mounting practices to tighten earlier notes; captured the new guidance in controller reliability, accessory telemetry, and cooling guides. | `themes/guides/high-power-vesc-scooter-reliability-guide.md`, `themes/guides/vesc-accessory-power-and-display-integration.md`, `themes/guides/motor_cooling_and_thermal_management.md` |
| 2025-11-10 | 1-100 | Reaffirmed controller reliability themes, firmware/tooling context, and pack economics; added new details on Spin Y-2 throttle calibration, Rob Ver’s TOLT telemetry, sprint performance baselines, Dualtron 7260R pack reality, and Rage Mechanics RM build configuration. | `themes/guides/spintend-ubox-integration-handbook.md`, `themes/guides/high-power-vesc-scooter-reliability-guide.md`, `themes/guides/diy-battery-supply-and-pack-architecture-2025.md`, `themes/brands/rage_mechanics.md` |
| 2025-11-10 | 101-200 | Captured Ninebot G30 BMS unlock guidance, controller market signals (VESC Express micro, Tronic skepticism, X12 packaging), manufacturing lessons for Lonnyo hotdog motors, battery budgeting tactics, braking hardware costs, and fresh thermal/ADC integration notes. | `themes/guides/high-voltage-vesc-controller-market-2025.md`, `themes/guides/ninebot-g30-vesc-conversion-playbook.md`, `themes/guides/brake-maintenance-and-upgrades.md`, `themes/guides/motor_cooling_and_thermal_management.md`, `themes/guides/diy-battery-sourcing-and-welding.md`, `themes/brands/lonnyo.md`, `themes/guides/vesc-accessory-power-and-display-integration.md`, `themes/guides/vesc-adc-accessory-integration.md`, `themes/brands/vsett.md` |
| 2025-11-10 | 201-300 | Logged community current ceilings for Ubox 85250/dual Lite builds, 3Shul vs. Spintend value debates, and Minim 100 V vs. FarDriver trade-offs; added sourcing notes on P45B modules, Jan’s 420C rotor batch, and Finn’s plug-and-play G30 harness; captured wiring guidance for Spin dials/ADC lighting, Spintend rim tire fitment, dual-controller CAN tuning quirks, 40 kW claim skepticism, Lonnyo/Hope shopping signals, Wolf Warrior X QC fixes, and torque-arm fabrication baselines. | `themes/guides/high-voltage-vesc-controller-market-2025.md`, `themes/guides/spintend-ubox-integration-handbook.md`, `themes/guides/vesc-adc-accessory-integration.md`, `themes/guides/brake-maintenance-and-upgrades.md`, `themes/guides/high-power-vesc-scooter-reliability-guide.md`, `themes/brands/spintend.md`, `themes/brands/lonnyo.md`, `themes/brands/kaabo.md` |
| 2025-11-10 | 301-291 (EOF) | Confirmed the source stops at line 291, distilled phase-current guardrails for Spintend 100/100 vs. 85150 hardware, reiterated the risks of over-volting Flipsky boards, and catalogued outstanding follow-up requests for future source drops. | `themes/guides/high-power-vesc-scooter-reliability-guide.md` |
| 2025-10-15 | 101-200 (refresh) | Captured this slice’s heat-sink paste requirements, deck fan ducting limits, VSS fallback setup, and Kaabo fabrication habits for future cross-references. | `themes/guides/motor_cooling_and_thermal_management.md`, `themes/guides/in-depth-vesc-parameter-guide.md`, `themes/brands/kaabo.md` |

Next starting point: resume at lines 101-200 if further refinement is requested.
