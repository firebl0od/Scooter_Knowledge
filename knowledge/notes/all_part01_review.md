## Key Findings

### Battery Maintenance & BMS Compatibility
- Critically unbalanced Xiaomi packs should be top-balanced per parallel group (e.g., groups 6/8/9) with an external charger such as TP4056 modules; the procedure can be performed without disconnecting the BMS, using crocodile clips for convenience.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1-L15】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L16-L19】
- M365 BMS Tool fails against the newest BLE firmware; downgrading the scooter’s BLE to version 073 restores connectivity and still allows custom firmware such as Gonka.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L16-L18】
- Denis’ repair BMS supports 10S4P packs today, with a 12S-capable model tentatively targeted for release around August 2020; shipping to Belgium typically takes one to two weeks despite pandemic delays.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L20-L33】

### Rita Adapter Capabilities & Limits
- Rita is designed for Xiaomi data-line behavior: it only supports parallel battery additions (not series stacks), can emulate the BMS when set to “permanent BMS emulator,” and can be configured over Bluetooth or via a serial tool when no Xiaomi dashboard is present.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L36-L149】
- The adapter is sold directly through m365.embedden.com to avoid ~20 % eBay fees; Denis also publishes installation guides and documentation for external battery builds and BMS repairs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L51-L156】
- Range Boost kits double an M365 Pro’s usable range because the external pack matches the stock capacity and charges through the OEM charger; Range+Speed kits require firmware changes when disconnecting the extra battery, whereas the range-only kit does not.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L160-L178】
- When grafted into non-Xiaomi clones without data lines, Rita can still arbitrate current as a pair of smart diodes, letting riders run only an auxiliary pack, though they forfeit fine-grained cutoff settings; charging behavior prioritizes whichever pack sits at higher voltage, then shares current, and the module independently routes charger input to the correct pack ports.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L642-L701】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L662-L670】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1187-L1189】
- Rita tolerates roughly 30 A output and can be power-cycled with an anti-spark switch between adapter and controller without harming charge management.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L742-L745】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1088-L1094】
- Rita can operate with 12S internal/external packs and blocks current flow between packs rather than equalizing voltages, so mismatched states of charge persist until riding draws them down; pairing unlike series counts (e.g., 10S with 12S) remains unsafe without firmware support.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L337-L345】
- Sustained power above roughly 1 kW risks overheating; Rita substitutes its own temperature telemetry when it seizes the scooter data line, so riders should heed its limits when pushing higher-current firmware tunes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L320-L322】
- The BMS Tool exposes Rita’s “permanent emulator” toggle for data-line-less builds and supports 13S configurations once riders change the internal battery setting from 10 to 13 series cells; Rita reports a standby +5 V on whichever pack input is idle, which Denis confirms is normal.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L748-L767】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1088-L1094】
- Factory harnesses ship with XT30 male leads on the adapter side, and Denis sticks with XT30 hardware (rather than XT60) because it fits the housing and safely handles the targeted current levels.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1080-L1083】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1509-L1516】
- Rita’s telemetry app will alternate between the scooter BMS and the external pack whenever their voltages are close; keep the auxiliary battery a few tenths of a volt higher (or temporarily disconnect it) to view external stats, as the shared data bus only exposes whichever side currently leads.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5154-L5174】

### Logistics & Fulfillment Notes
- Denis ships adapters worldwide via his storefront but must use ground carriers for lithium packs, preventing combined kit shipments to regions like Kuwait; Rita units alone can ship by post or UPS once custom rates are arranged.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L198-L235】
- Pandemic logistics continued to bite: by late June he still lacked a global lithium solution and limited battery exports to Europe, while juggling batch production (30 Rita boards, 15 bags, 9 batteries shipped on 29 June).【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1098-L1100】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1478-L1484】
- Complete Rita+bag+battery kits cost roughly €250–€280 plus ~€20 shipping depending on charger inclusion, reflecting low-volume manufacturing economics and quality components like Samsung 35E cells and branded XT30 connectors.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1446-L1512】
- Denis hand-added UPS options for Kuwait and fielded inquiries from Kenya while catching up on a week-plus order backlog; by mid-June he was still solo-packing batches and quoting June 17–20 restocks before resuming sales.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L200-L252】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L746-L767】
- Batteries remained Europe-only shipments, with DHL-Express bringing BMS restocks from China and custom 13S builds accepted on pre-order once charger supply stabilized (roughly 2–3 weeks lead).【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L833-L845】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1098-L1100】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1438-L1445】
- August buyers continued to see roughly 10-day door-to-door timelines within Europe as Denis assembled packs early in the week and shipped mid-week, though he reminded riders that DPD will only move lithium batteries inside the EU (blocking Norway orders).【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4756-L4773】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5891-L5892】
- 12S charger stock remained tight until his supplier returned from holiday; Denis shared snapshots of incoming units and cautioned that the battery builder’s vacation meant 12S packs would resume shipping mid-August.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5440-L5447】
- By 14 August Denis quoted three business days to assemble a battery and confirmed regional stock nodes—Poland and London—for faster Rita fulfillment while batteries continued to ship from Europe only.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6077-L6086】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6324-L6326】

### New Insights from Lines 12001–17000

#### Battery Safety, Charging & Configuration
- Group veterans warn against suspiciously cheap “13S4P 60 Ah” packs: the chemistry cannot deliver the advertised capacity and the unknown BMS limits make them a fire risk, so riders are urged to stick with reputable 12 S options.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L12005-L12018】
- Before commuting in heavy rain, seal deck seams, cable ports, and the charge door with silicone and smear lithium grease around the hub to keep water out; stock tires also lose significant grip on wet turns, so pace accordingly.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L12014-L12026】
- Denis reiterates that Rita expects an external pack with a shared charge/discharge port; if you reuse another Xiaomi pack that has a separate charge lead, Rita can overfill it during regen, so either swap in a common-port BMS or only charge that pack off-scooter.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L12753-L12767】
- When pairing Rita with 12 S builds, set the adapter to the correct series count (and recuperation ceiling ≈4.15 V per cell) and disable KERS if you cannot verify the configuration—otherwise downhill regen can exceed Rita’s ~30 A design limit and crack the module, even though the scooter survives.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L15868-L15910】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L15915-L15945】
- Riders chasing 12 S performance should budget for stronger mechanical brakes because a fully charged setup can reach ~40 km/h on the flat, and brake upgrades keep pace with the higher power draw.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L12580-L12588】

#### Firmware & Troubleshooting Practices
- ST-Link v2 dongles remain the go-to unbricking tool: they cost <€5, require only four temporary clip-on leads (no soldering), and let you restore stock firmware before re-flashing via Bluetooth apps.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L12550-L12579】
- Third-party dashboards (e.g., m365dash) can block Rita from talking on the data line; disconnecting or switching those displays into “update mode” restores app access so you can pair and configure the adapter.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L12949-L12987】
- Bluetooth flashing is inherently fragile: failed attempts can soft-brick controllers, so community members advise keeping an ST-Link on hand and double-flashing Xiaomi firmware packages if the first attempt stalls.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L12593-L12607】
- Face LTD’s current-step defaults (~600 mA) are considered safer for stock controllers; cranking throttle step up to 800 mA on unreinforced boards overheats traces and wiring, so most riders cap virtual currents near 25 A on 12 S scooters.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L15867-L15909】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L16994-L17009】

#### Tires, Brakes & Handling
- Heavy riders (~130 kg) report that Xuan Cheng 10" street tires at 4 bar with reinforced inner tubes can still feel soft; swapping to 10" tubes and monitoring wear is recommended for better carcass support.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L12033-L12055】
- Align brake rotors according to their directional arrows—mounting discs backwards can fatigue the spokes under hard stops, especially once X-Tech or other bike calipers are installed.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L14022-L14041】
- Riders fighting X-Tech piston stickiness found that reverting to stock pads (or upgrading to higher-end mechanical calipers like TRP Spyke) and bleeding trapped air solves uneven retraction; ceramic aftermarket pads tended to swell under heat.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L15048-L15136】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L15309-L15369】
- Expect the scooter dash to misreport state-of-charge when 12 S packs are attached: it shows 100 % until the external voltage falls to the internal 10 S level, so rely on charger LEDs or a voltmeter for actual charge confirmation.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L13333-L13346】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L15196-L15205】
- XT30 charge leads can overheat when pushed beyond ~25 A continuous; builders upgrading to 1200 W tunes often switch to thicker-gauge wiring or XT60 connectors to avoid melted insulation.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L13317-L13329】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L16184-L16223】

#### Ride Experience & Range Planning
- A healthy Pro pack typically yields ~20–22 km at 34 km/h for an 82 kg rider; adding a 10 S 4 P external roughly doubles usable range, while 12 S packs plus stock internal battery net ~32–40 km depending on wind and speed caps.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L12799-L12814】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L15586-L15629】
- Simple Y-cables can keep a scooter powered, but mismatched voltages between parallel packs cause overnight self-activation as current equalizes; Rita’s smart diodes stop that backflow and prevent unsolicited wakeups.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L13271-L13331】
- Riders aiming for 25 km/h legal compliance with 12 S setups can hold that speed on steep or windy sections by capping virtual current around 24 A, trading top-end for torque while preserving long-range efficiency.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L16484-L16513】

### Motor Cooling & Modification Takeaways
- Denis dismisses rim-mounted “cooling fans,” arguing that real airflow at 30 km/h already refreshes the hub shell; effective cooling requires improving heat transfer from the stator (e.g., via ferrofluid) rather than blowing ambient air on the cover.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L422-L541】
- Community feedback notes ferrofluid availability challenges (commonly sourced from Russia/Australia) and typical fill volumes around 5–10 ml per hub; Denis warns that a cool motor shell after hard riding indicates poor conduction and questions the additive’s effectiveness.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L521-L548】

### External Battery Behaviour & Safety (Mid-September 2020)
- Riders seeing braking cut-outs with full auxiliary packs were advised to set Rita’s recuperation threshold to 4.150 V per cell; the adapter intentionally disables energy recovery whenever the external battery sits above 41 V, and firmware “4” remains the current public build.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10561-L10579】
- Continuous red LEDs were traced to ESA1919 clone batteries that ship with inverted charge wiring—Rita will flag overvoltage, yet it lacks reverse-polarity protection, so respecting the adapter’s ~30 A ceiling is critical even as Denis entertains future 60 A-capable revisions.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10628-L10676】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L11260-L11276】
- Rita loads a 12 S add-on pack solo until its voltage drops near 42 V, then shares current with the internal battery; Denis suggested isolated DC–DC chargers for riders stacking extra 2 S sections, while reminding high-current builders that parallel 10 S packs remain the safest route.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L11290-L11300】
- The 12 S Range+Speed kit stays “plug and ride” on Mi Scooter Pro 2 units—no firmware flashes needed—and its external pack already balances cells via onboard BMS despite lacking temperature sensors.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10794-L10798】

### Battery Security, Capacity Options & Logistics
- A stolen 12 S pack pushed Denis to prototype lockable Wildman-bag mounts (initially 12 S3 P Samsung 35E) and to caution that even reinforced housings only deter quick grab-and-run theft; he continues to refer custom 12 S4 P or 13 S builds to partners such as @m365krakow.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10685-L10729】
- Riders confirmed 12 S conversions can hit ~40 km/h by simply raising scooter over-voltage limits to 51 V, though stepping beyond 12 S demands controller upgrades (higher-spec MOSFETs/capacitors) and careful sourcing of replacement internal packs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L11319-L11327】

### Firmware & Controller Tuning Guidance
- Community consensus kept Sport-mode peaks around 26–27 A on Pro/Pro2 scooters; pushing 30 A requires reinforced controllers, thicker bus traces, thermal compound on MOSFETs, and lower regen current (≈20 A) to avoid stressing Rita or the braking circuit.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10813-L10834】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L11014-L11072】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L11149-L11176】
- Quadratic/“intensity of current change” throttle curves around 300–350 mA and anti-clonk firmware settings were repeatedly recommended for snappier launches without over-shooting amperage limits.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L11052-L11072】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L11105-L11133】
- Builders reminded each other that wattage readouts in Xiaogen represent PWM-adjusted effective power; voltage boosts (e.g., 51 V 12 S packs) lift top speed while amperage chiefly affects hill torque, so chasing >30 A often yields diminishing returns and higher thermal stress.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L11018-L11029】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L11190-L11224】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L11455-L11468】

### Tire Setup & Ride Feel
- 10" XuanCheng conversions remained popular for comfort, yet riders acknowledged slower launches versus 8.5" rubber and advised 4.0 bar front / 4.5 bar rear pressures for ~95 kg loads, topping up with zero-loss Schrader adapters or Xiaomi’s automatic inflator.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L11304-L11307】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L11497-L11502】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L11667-L11695】

### Waterproofing & Anti-Theft DIY Projects
- One heavy-weather rider sealed joints with silicone plus lithium grease and wired a hydrometer + buzzer to an Arduino Uno (fed by a DC–DC converter) so water ingress triggers a loud alarm—parts lists and wiring tips were shared for replication.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10589-L10614】
- Francois also planned a gyroscope-based 120 dB alarm tied to ignition keys or Bluetooth presence, keeping the buzzer active until motion stops—an inexpensive, high-volume deterrent against opportunistic thieves.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10797-L10805】

### External Battery Sourcing & Fitment Guidance
- Riders compared AliExpress packs versus Denis’ LG-cell builds, emphasizing the need for honest capacity ratings and matching battery dimensions to Wildman 1–3 L bags or Denis’ dedicated mounts; 2 L bags comfortably house ~8 Ah bricks, while cheaper listings often exaggerate capacity.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L688-L733】
- Denis resells batteries at cost and encouraged the community to surface reputable Chinese suppliers and verify actual capacities before purchase.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L697-L705】
- M365 dashboards can be retrofitted onto base models for richer telemetry, independent of Rita, via simple three-wire swaps or aftermarket boards such as m365dash.com offerings.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1255-L1267】
- Wildman’s E2 (≈180 × 105 × 83 mm) hard case reliably fits Denis’ 8 Ah-class packs, while the 1 L shell only houses compact 36 V hoverboard bricks; the 3 L size is bulky but workable, and riders often rely on 3D-printed brackets to secure the bags cleanly.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L720-L735】
- Builders favor quality cells and wiring (e.g., Sony-based 36 V 15 Ah packs, 12 AWG leads) and caution that XT30 disconnects are not designed for frequent hot-plugging—reinforced, semi-permanent joints are safer for Rita installs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1035-L1059】
- Denis’ turnkey packs use shared charge/discharge leads; charging them off-scooter requires a dedicated adapter harness once the pack is removed from Rita’s loom.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1101-L1144】
- The standard Rita kit still ships with the 2 L Wildman hard case—12S4P bricks just clear the enclosure—and Denis advised waiting for future production runs before requesting 10S5P or 12S5P customs sized for the 3 L variant.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5320-L5335】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5460-L5473】
- Denis currently pairs his 10S packs with Daly 36 V 25 A common-port BMS boards and noted that higher parallel counts remain on hold until supply stabilizes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5470-L5477】

### Standalone Charging & Port Considerations
- Denis’ external packs integrate a BMS but share charge/discharge leads, so field charging requires an adapter harness; Rita otherwise charges internal packs through their native ports and external packs via the common XT connector, making workplace top-offs feasible when the battery stays on the scooter.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1100-L1144】
- When battery BMS units expose separate charge jacks, Rita cannot halt overcharge via the discharge lead, so common-port packs remain the safest plug-and-play option.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1191-L1194】
- Denis confirmed on 18 August that Rita directs charge current toward whichever pack sits lower in voltage, reassuring 12S owners who see telemetry swing between ~50 V at rest and ~24 V while the charger tops up the lower pack.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6515-L6533】
- Denis advised interrupting power between Rita and the scooter controller—not between battery and Rita—when adding anti-spark switches so charging logic remains intact.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1088-L1094】
- Users experimenting with multi-pack fleets confirmed Rita automatically tops whichever pack sits below the charger voltage and that external-only charging sessions demand manual harness swaps once the auxiliary pack leaves the scooter.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1171-L1189】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1101-L1144】
- 12S builds cannot rely on Xiaomi’s 42 V charger; riders either rework the OEM brick with 14.3 kΩ feedback resistors or adopt higher-voltage CC/CV supplies, accepting that Rita still funnels both packs through a single inlet unless the external battery is unplugged for standalone charging.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4511-L4524】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4759-L4773】
- Denis pointed 12S owners toward Mean Well ELG-240-48A-class supplies and warned that sourcing Xiaomi’s coaxial plug is often the hardest step when building custom chargers.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4760-L4773】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4813-L4815】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4920-L4922】

### Extended Battery Pricing, BMS Selection & Charging Behavior
- Denis prices his turnkey 10S4P pack at roughly €170 with Wildman bag around €30 and shipping near €20, underscoring that he uses Samsung 35E cells, 20 A common-port BMS boards, and genuine XT30 connectors sized to fit the scooter’s inlet better than XT60 hardware.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1501-L1525】
- His smart internal BMS employs separate charge/discharge leads, so he avoids it in auxiliary packs; instead, external batteries rely on single XT30 leads, letting Rita and the scooter’s charge port fill both packs in parallel while 20 A BMS units are recommended (15 A variants work but sag slightly).【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1545-L1595】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1803-L1812】
- Rita can refill internal and external packs through the stock charge jack even on mixed 10S/12S setups, supports simultaneous charger use, and sequences charge on mismatched voltages (internal pack halts at 42 V before a 12S/13S unit continues toward 50.4–54.6 V); Denis cautions that feeding the internal pack with a 54.6 V source leaves only the BMS as over-voltage protection.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1800-L1812】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2280-L2287】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2591-L2595】
- Without Rita, paralleling packs risks bypassing external BMS safeguards; Dimitrij stresses keeping the BMS in circuit and warns that an 8 Ah pack can fail violently, while Denis notes Rita’s dual inputs tolerate only equal-voltage paralleled packs and require “permanent BMS emulation” when no smart data line exists.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2785-L2805】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2970-L2986】
- The 12S3P “range+speed” combo remains the preferred upgrade but hinges on sourcing or modifying a 50.4 V charger; Denis pulled the pre-bundled kit once chargers ran out, advising DIY resistor swaps, while positioning the 10S pack as a plug-and-play range boost for riders unwilling to touch firmware or chargers.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1924-L1925】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2547-L2549】
- Denis confirmed current 12S3P kits ride on Samsung 35E cells (≈10.35 Ah at 44.4 V) and that pricing reflects premium parts versus AliExpress options alongside the labor of hand-built batches.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4913-L4918】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4761-L4764】
- Range+Speed bundles still tally around €260 while standalone 12S4P packs cost roughly €230 because of the additional cells and wiring, so 3 L bag experiments escalate budgets quickly as parallels increase.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5319-L5335】
- Builders exploring 21700 and 26650 formats observed that a 12S4P 21700 pack matches 12S6P 18650 capacity but strains enclosure space, making bag volume the limiting factor for ultra-long-range goals.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5908-L5935】

### Firmware, Controller & Recovery Lessons
- Rita ships preconfigured but 12S users must raise the firmware over-voltage limit to roughly 51 V (and typically disable charge-mode prompts) via tools like XiaoFlasher and Denis’ video guide, whereas 10S riders can stay on stock firmware; connecting to the Rita app still demands downgrading BLE to 072/090 on Xiaomi dashboards.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1860-L1872】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1924-L1925】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2509-L2513】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2719-L2722】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2919-L2920】
- Bricked controllers can be revived with an ST-Link and stock 1.5.5 firmware, but users report that flashing mismatched images (e.g., BLE 126 onto Denis’ BMS) triggers error 21 until reflashed; Denis and the community steer riders toward established videos and forum tools when recovering from failed DownG attempts.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1891-L1900】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1812-L1818】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1920-L1925】
- Custom firmware discussions settle on ≈27 A (≈800 W) as a safe sustained draw for Xiaomi drivetrains; Denis reminds riders that 350 W hub motors can only tolerate kilowatt-level surges briefly before overheating, and higher phase/battery current settings drain packs rapidly despite headline speed gains.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2500-L2526】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2200-L2207】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2338-L2347】
- Modding the stock charger with Vishay 14.3 kΩ feedback resistors lets it output 50.4 V for 12S packs; Denis still recommends upgrading OEM units instead of trusting unknown third-party bricks and stresses proper soldering technique (use flux, check for shorts) during the conversion.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2213-L2241】
- Error code crib sheets shared mid-chat list ESC fault numbers (e.g., 28 for HS FET issues), helping diagnose post-mod anomalies such as MOSFET swaps gone wrong.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2243-L2249】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2300-L2304】

### Motor Upgrades, Performance & Safety Anecdotes
- Riders experimenting with 350 W aftermarket hubs found higher peak wattage but lazier launches versus stock 300 W units, suggesting firmware current limits—and voltage boosts like 12S packs—matter more than nominal motor labels for real-world torque.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2614-L2695】
- Community members warned against spoofing tire sizes to inflate dashboard speed since GPS and hardware ceilings still cap Xiaomi scooters around 35 km/h on 42 V packs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2633-L2667】
- High-speed downhill runs with KERS disabled have cooked BMS boards in wet conditions, reinforcing earlier advice to keep regenerative braking within safe thresholds and protect electronics from water ingress.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2678-L2694】

### Accessory Fitment & Community Tips
- The Wildman hard case Denis bundles is the 2 L variant; larger 3 L shells exist, but most Rita owners find the 2 L format the right compromise for 10S packs and cable clearance.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2775-L2786】
- Denis contracts 3Dway Kraków to print his rear mounting brackets and keeps the STL private as a commercial design, though riders continue to request custom current limits (e.g., 65 A phase, 35 A battery) for bigger motors.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2701-L2737】
- Large-capacity builds discussed extremes such as 60 V 40 Ah packs delivering ~130 km range at ~11 kg, illustrating the weight/range trade-offs when leaving Xiaomi’s 36 V ecosystem.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1501-L1507】

### Fulfillment & Payment Updates (July 2020)
- UK demand spiked in early July, with Denis’ sales map showing the region as his hottest market while local reseller Dimitrij handled Rita distribution and accepted preorders for July 13 dispatches.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1691-L1743】
- Logistics headwinds persisted: he paused complete kits when 12S chargers dried up, juggled bag shortages (debating emergency buys from Polish resellers), and leaned on ground carriers like DPD/UPS/TNT because DHL air won’t fly lithium packs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1924-L1938】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2556-L2565】
- By late July he faced payment-gateway outages that blocked battery sales; Ritas, BMS boards, and bags stayed online, but chargers and packs slipped to mid-August estimates while he navigated Russian-to-Polish bank transfers.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2924-L2965】
- Customers eager for range packs were asked to check back once supplier payments resumed, though Denis hoped to reopen sales within days and flagged Revolut as a potential—but operationally awkward—workaround.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2966-L2998】

### Charger Upgrades & High-Voltage Builds
- Denis paused bundled 12S “range+speed” kits because compatible 50.4 V chargers were out of stock, though he offered 12S batteries to DIYers willing to modify chargers; 10S kits remained available for range-only needs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1268-L1276】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1371-L1374】
- He documented how to retune Xiaomi’s stock charger for 12S packs by replacing the 10 kΩ feedback resistor with a 30 kΩ+27 kΩ stack (~14.3 kΩ) and trimming the output to 50.4 V via the adjustment pot.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1280-L1286】
- Chargers limited to ~2 A may fail to replenish both packs when sharing Rita’s inlet; higher-output units (≥3–4 A) should balance speed with thermal limits of the internal BMS and wiring harnesses.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1287-L1319】
- Denis warned that 5 A BMS firmware hacks overheat legacy M365 boards to ~150 °C, shortening their life even if the scooter seems fine; Pro revisions tolerate higher current better, but quality MOSFETs, reinforced traces, and tempered charger voltages remain mandatory for 12S–13S builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1304-L1355】
- Community builders detune aftermarket chargers (e.g., Vruzend 13S units) to ~54 V for longevity and pair them with reputable Daly/Daly-style BMS modules when upgrading AliExpress packs to honest capacities.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1369-L1380】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1216-L1264】

### High-Voltage & Component Stress Insights
- Users exploring 12S–13S builds highlighted the need for quality MOSFETs, reinforced controller traces, and conservative charger voltages (e.g., dialing 54 V on 13S Vruzend chargers) to survive higher loads.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1238-L1249】
- Denis cautioned that 5 A charge firmware hacks overheat legacy M365 BMS boards (~150 °C), whereas newer Pro revisions tolerate higher current; his kits leverage Samsung 35E cells and reputable 20 A BMS modules sourced from AliExpress.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1304-L1344】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1431-L1436】
- While 13S and even 15S are electrically possible on recent hardware, Denis warned older scooters cannot handle the voltage without resistor swaps and broader component upgrades.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1445-L1454】

### Maintenance & Repair Tips
- Water-damaged M365 packs often revive after cleaning the BMS with isopropyl alcohol; if cell telemetry still misreports, Denis sells compatible replacements.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1422-L1428】
- External accessories like LED strips require appropriate step-down converters since most consumer strips are rated ≤24 V, making direct 36 V taps unsafe.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L929-L938】
- A regen-heavy stop without Rita protection scorched a customer’s BMS and controller; Denis urged disconnecting the pack immediately, recharging sub-2 V cells individually, and reworking any sloppy sensor wiring before blaming the board.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L780-L830】
- Dashboard brownouts triggered by headlight toggles generally indicate BMS faults—Denis advised swapping in a known-good pack, checking each parallel group, and replacing fuses before condemning the scooter’s electronics if soldering skills are limited.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5450-L5457】
- Solid tires remain a last resort: veterans noted they consume ~20 % more energy, ride harsher, and can fatigue battery tabs, recommending 10" pneumatic CST/Wanda options, reinforced tubes, and fair labor pricing instead.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4524-L4744】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4782-L4788】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5486-L5496】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5582-L5589】

### New Insights from Lines 27001–32000

#### Tools, Diagnostics & Configuration
- Some handheld multimeters for scooter work ship with 12 V A23 cells and fragile F200 mA glass fuses; riders recommend replacing the blown fuse and, if needed, switching to sturdier touch-screen models such as the Mustool MT111 sourced from Banggood.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L27001-L27038】
- Builders lean on LiitoKala or Opus test bays plus a 3.3 Ω / 25 W Ohmite resistor block to safely discharge or capacity-test loose 18650 cells before pack assembly, especially when reworking customer batteries that arrive fully charged.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L27300-L27335】
- ST-Link remains the recovery tool of record for BMS mishaps: flashing the official images from hackm365 via ST-Link revives Xiaomi packs after loading Ninebot firmware by mistake, though the process may require temporarily lifting the BMS leads.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L27411-L27427】
- When pairing aftermarket alarms, note that some immobilisers expect 415 MHz remotes—owners running 315 MHz keyfobs need matching radio modules before hard-wiring the scooter feed (typically a 5 V tap from the controller).【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L27578-L27587】

#### Battery Building, BMS Behavior & Logistics
- Community members organised Alibaba bulk buys for Monorim 500 W hubs at roughly €80 shipped—participants cautioned that 11.11 sales events slow fulfillment and that direct-from-factory harnesses may omit connectors found on retail kits.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L27338-L27360】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L31915-L31917】
- Denis’ 13 S4 P packs just fit his 2 L Wildman bags; stacking two yields a 13 S8 P setup that tames voltage sag for dual 500 W builds while highlighting how LG MJ1 cores droop more than Samsung 35E under the same loads.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L27611-L27620】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L27641-L27676】
- Cheap eBay BMS boards rated “25 A” but tripping around 18 A caused external packs to drop offline despite perfectly balanced groups (~3.51 V each); swapping to reputable 20–30 A boards from trusted vendors resolves the cut-outs and still pairs safely with 8 A-per-cell batteries or 10 S3 P ebike upgrades.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L28421-L28499】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L28503-L28515】

#### Rita, Firmware & Controller Management
- Denis confirmed a known bug where Rita’s dashboard momentarily jumps from ~25 % to ~60–70 % state of charge during heavy regen; a firmware fix is queued, so owners should treat the spike as cosmetic.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L27480-L27482】
- Pro 2 owners reported that Xiaomi’s post-2.2.3 updates clamp custom firmware; sticking with DRV2.2.3 or temporarily downgrading to DRV155 lets them configure Rita via M365 BMS Tool before returning to the newer firmware.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L27922-L27943】
- Denis’ Android Rita app has not yet added Pro 2 BLE support, so riders either toggle the adapter into “permanent BMS emulator” mode via desktop tools or momentarily flash legacy firmware to reach the configuration menus.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L27922-L27935】
- XiaoGen can run on Pro 2/1S/Essential boards provided riders keep the stock BLE, flash the XiaoGen2‑0‑5 migration ZIP with m365Downgrade XG Mod 21, and keep an ST-Link on hand for safety.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L27528-L27536】
- Setting controller current limits requires matching the true pack voltage: e.g., 32 A on 12 S pulls ~1.3 kW, so dial back Drive-mode amps when targeting a 900 W ceiling.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L31883-L31900】
- Riders lap (wet-sand) both the ESC baseplate and deck mating surface to improve thermal transfer, treating the assembly like a CPU heatsink install to keep MOSFETs cool during 40 A peaks.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L27206-L27242】
- Stock dashboards can misreport speed after 10" swaps unless the wheel speed constant is adjusted (≈8.1 % for Xiaogen users) and verified against GPS; “Russian” throttle mode still maps lever travel directly to torque for those chasing motorbike-style response.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L27483-L27519】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L27493-L27507】
- Quality connectors matter: Denis notes his harness length is sufficient to coil inside the Wildman bag, but if riders relocate plugs they should stick to genuine Amass XT30 hardware and practice soldering on scrap to avoid melting shells.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L27428-L27440】

#### Tires, Brakes & Chassis Hardware
- Ten-inch conversions vary: CST 10×2.25 tyres run thick carcasses that may need rim sanding, Kenda-branded 152 mm casings can feel tight, and Wanda 10×2 options stay grippy at ~4.2 bar while lasting longer than the ultra-soft red variants.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L27107-L27110】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L27244-L27245】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L27900-L27921】
- SKF-style 2RS bearings (vs. 2Z shields) are preferred for wet riding because they seal out water rather than merely large debris.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L27274-L27275】
- Semi-metallic disc pads (often gold-coloured) hold up better in rain than the organic sets bundled with Xtech calipers; ceramics run hot, so bed-in fresh pads and monitor rotor wear when upgrading braking power.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L31937-L31952】
- Rear-suspension kits extend wheelbase ~10 cm and noticeably stabilise Xiaomi frames according to early adopters.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L27276-L27279】

#### Security & Accessories
- A compact Master Lock cable looped round street furniture works for quick stops, but keep the mechanism lubricated (graphite is preferred long term over WD‑40 to avoid grit buildup).【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L27568-L27573】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L27601-L27603】
- Some couriers rely on ignition-cut switches and alarms for short deliveries, yet peers warn that leaving scooters unlocked invites theft within minutes in dense cities.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L27392-L27407】

#### Troubleshooting & Field Incidents
- Scooters that power-cycle after curb strikes often suffer momentary connector lift; inspect motor leads (especially browned phase pins) and BMS harnesses, reseat plugs, and follow Denis’ diagnostic rule—verify XT30 output voltage first, then swap known-good modules one at a time.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L28563-L28620】
- Seven Foxes’ rain-damaged OEM pack underscored the need to waterproof charge ports and dashboards; Denis estimates ~8 hours to recharge his 13.8 Ah range kit with the stock brick.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L28576-L28592】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L28586-L28588】
- Riders chasing 12 S speed gains on Pro 2 hardware saw controllers shut down mid-ride until they reconfigured Rita’s pack parameters via the M365 BMS Tool; others disable or soften KERS (e.g., 18 A limit) to avoid overloading the ESC during hard braking.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L27927-L27957】

#### Performance Notes
- 500 W hub swaps paired with 12 S packs don’t raise top-end by themselves but hold 45–48 km/h on flats without sagging to ~44 km/h like the 300 W motor, especially with extra voltage and current overhead.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L31894-L31913】
- Discussions on dual-motor builds highlighted lingering questions about efficiency (km per mAh vs. power per watt), suggesting a need for future dyno-style testing beyond anecdotal logs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L31917-L31927】

### New Insights from Lines 17001–22000

#### Controller Current Management & Thermal Practices
- Current-step tuning directly shapes controller heat: conservative riders keep steps near 350 mA to reduce thermal load, while maxing the slider trades heat for throttle immediacy.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L17001-L17003】
- Repeated 60–65 A experiments on stock harnesses have melted motor-to-ESC connector caps; testers reported 45 A cruises staying near 31 °C and settled on 50–55 A as the practical ceiling without further reinforcement, especially in cooler ambient temps.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L17043-L17067】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L17160-L17199】

#### Rita Behavior, Firmware & Tooling
- If Rita “ghosts” an external pack (static voltage, no internal data), blip the throttle for a second to force re-detection; Denis also keeps the English manual updated online for troubleshooting steps.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L17220-L17224】
- Rita’s BMS emulation hides live watt/amp telemetry on Xiaomi dashboards by design, so zero readings in the app are normal while the adapter owns the data line.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L17186-L17188】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L18653-L18658】
- Denis reaffirmed a 4.10 V recuperation cutoff after reconsidering earlier 4.15 V advice, later planning app support for 4.18 V tweaks; leave braking currents conservative (e.g., 4 000–20 000) and disable KERS when coasting to protect unreinforced controllers at 12 S voltages.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L18554-L18576】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L21983-L21999】
- An iOS “Scooter Companion” beta now flashes Xiaomi 1S/Pro2 and Ninebot G30 firmware, giving Apple users parity with Android flashing tools.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L18038-L18039】

#### Battery Sourcing, Wiring & Safety
- Community teardown of a “36 V 20 Ah” AliExpress pack revealed only 12 genuine cells—Francois warns legit 20 Ah builds cost ~€350 and ship as 10S6P; round-number claims or >42 V open-circuit readings on “36 V” packs signal sand-filled scams.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L17983-L17999】
- External packs from Tudor/VTA use same-port BMS wiring: connect Rita’s XT30 to C-/B- and leave P- unused so charge and discharge share the port safely.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L18484-L18495】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L18680-L18685】
- Persistent low cells after water ingress may stem from storage at 100 % state-of-charge; aim to store packs ~50 % and replace suspect groups rather than risk runaway—damaged cells can vent even at rest.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L18220-L18245】
- Builders store large Li-ion assemblies in LiPo-safe bags or garages with extinguishers to mitigate the “kaboom” potential of multi-pack builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L18280-L18307】

#### Motor Selection & Dual-Drive Planning
- Mixing different hub wattages without matching Kv causes the faster unit to drag the slower one; AWD conversions need identical motors plus duplicate controllers, BLE boards, and ideally separate packs to share the load.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L18030-L18049】
- Riders chasing 500 W hubs gain hill torque but must reinforce controllers with thicker traces, MOSFET upgrades, and 13 S batteries to exploit the 48 V-class windings safely.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L18838-L18848】
- Even 350 W swaps benefit from firmware tuning: higher Kv motors demand extra phase current for launch, so reflash limits accordingly or acceleration will lag behind the stock 250 W setup.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L17626-L17657】

#### Tires, Brakes & Handling
- Budget MTB-style mechanical calipers (e.g., “Bike Attitude”) can outperform XTECH when paired with a 135 mm rotor and finely set stationary pads; baking solid tires eases installation but seasoned riders still prefer pneumatic 10" rubber for grip.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L17225-L17241】
- 10" tire swaps demand firm pressures—running only 36 psi saps top speed, so inflate toward 3.5 bar while checking fender/frame clearance to reclaim the expected 12 S gains.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L18712-L18728】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L18946-L18948】
- Stem and handlebar mods often require custom clamps or welded risers; riders experimenting with motorcycle bars relocate dashboards into bags and add auxiliary lighting powered by separate packs for safety.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L21907-L21961】

#### Charging, Range & Voltage Planning
- Always pair 12 S packs with 50.4 V chargers—using a 42 V brick leaves the pack around 39 V and robs the expected speed bump until the correct charger arrives.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L18828-L18835】
- Denis ships lithium packs half-charged (~42 V) to stay within transport rules; charge them on arrival before judging speed or range, and remember Rita can juggle 13 S internal + 12 S external stacks for added punch when configured properly.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L21896-L21903】
- 10S4P “range” packs carry roughly the same cell count as 12S3P “speed” packs; the extra series group in 12 S favors higher voltage while additional parallels (e.g., 12S4P) are needed to curb voltage sag on hard pulls.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L18213-L18214】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L21474-L21485】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L21218-L21221】


### Serial Debugging & Clone Scooter Caveats
- Serial access requires FTDI ground tied to Rita ground, TX on yellow, RX on white, and a pull-up resistor (≈1–10 kΩ) because Rita’s TX pin is open-drain; powering the board from any battery pack is sufficient for configuration.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L578-L618】
- When used on non-M365 clones without BMS telemetry, Rita functions as a pair of smart diodes: only same-series-count packs are supported, regenerative braking must remain disabled, and serial tweaking is optional despite curiosity from early adopters.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L585-L640】

### Repair BMS & Rita Deployment Updates (July–August 2020)
- Denis confirmed the repair BMS mounting holes are 4 mm and reiterated that it can be configured over a simple CP2102-class USB-UART link, letting clone scooters without Xiaomi dashboards adopt the board.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3003-L3010】
- Rita can still support scooters that do not expect BMS telemetry on the data line, keeping external-pack builds viable beyond the Xiaomi range.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3105-L3106】

### High-Voltage Upgrades & Controller Preparation
- Moving from 10S to 12S (≈44 V) requires three steps—flash higher-voltage firmware, reinforce controller power traces, and source or mod a 50.4 V charger—after which riders see roughly 36 km/h, ~800 W output, and ~50 km range with an auxiliary pack.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3011-L3025】
- Denis cautioned that unlocking the “hardware speed limit” for 12S gains adds danger; he advises keeping firmware-limited speeds near 34 km/h despite ~20 % voltage headroom and rider reports of 38.5 km/h on standard frames.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3107-L3116】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3122-L3129】
- Rita ships with XT30 harnesses (XT60 shells do not fit the frame), caps current near 30 A (~1.5 kW at 13S), and still expects users to align pack voltages before running dual external batteries or bumping to 13S builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3119-L3162】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3953-L3966】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4295-L4298】
- Denis urged prospective 13S riders to cut Rita’s pink sense lead, keep the XT30 connector, and remember that meaningful performance still arrives at 12S without extra charger hassles.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3742-L3746】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4337-L4343】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4370-L4378】
- He reiterated that 10S packs house 40 cells versus 36 in his 12S3P builds, so riders chasing endurance over speed should not ignore the denser 10S option.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3826-L3844】

### External Battery Selection, Charging & Maintenance
- Separate charge-port batteries remain risky with Rita because the adapter cannot halt over-voltage through the discharge lead; Denis continues to steer riders toward common-port BMS packs or replacing the board entirely.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3070-L3090】
- Denis re-opened battery sales with 10S4P packs shipping next week and limited 12S4P stock priced at about €230 once charger shortages ease after the team’s early-August holiday; he also reminded buyers of his “Antarctica” shipping workaround when bundling orders.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3520-L3596】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3742-L3757】
- Community testing shows 12S Rita kits can log 43 km/h bursts while mixed-pack riders must still monitor heat (~71 °C motors) and reinforce controllers to survive sustained >500 W tunes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3553-L3554】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3799-L3804】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3842-L3848】
- Denis validated that his repair BMS will balance itself back to 100 % over one to two weeks if “balance mode” stays set to “always,” though users can still top-balance stubborn cells manually.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3857-L3866】
- 21700 cells are viable for custom internal packs and offer straightforward capacity gains, but over-volting ESA-class scooters still demands careful charger planning.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3900-L3918】
- Mid-August Q&A reiterated that Rita draws from the higher-voltage pack until voltages equalize, then shares the load, underscoring why external packs need honest capacity and common-port BMS boards.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6107-L6115】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6254-L6264】
- Denis steered builders toward 25–30 A common-port 13S BMS options for Rita, warning that higher-rated or separate-charge boards complicate installs and can starve the adapter.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6259-L6266】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6832-L6883】
- Attempting to expand his finished 12S3P packs proved impractical; Denis advised ordering a fresh build from his Krakow supplier instead of retrofitting extra parallel groups.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6374-L6403】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6404-L6407】

### App Connectivity & Instrumentation Notes
- Multiple users saw the M365 BMS Tool report blank data after rides despite BLE 090 firmware; Denis advised ensuring the external pack sits ~0.5 V above the internal pack for Rita to appear, killing other Bluetooth apps, downgrading BLE if necessary, or trying older Android builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3241-L3308】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4295-L4304】
- Rita only reports as the primary BMS when the external battery leads internal voltage by roughly 0.5 V, so telemetry will toggle between packs during mixed-charge scenarios.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4295-L4300】

### Accessories, Cooling & Charging Etiquette
- Denis maintained that stick-on hub “coolers” are cosmetic; real gains come from thermal conduction improvements, while controller reinforcement (soldered trace thickening) remains mandatory once riders chase ~850 W or more.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3203-L3210】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3984-L3990】
- The community continues to favor X-Tech semi-hydraulic brakes, 130–140 mm rotors, and even hydraulic bicycle kits for stronger stopping, with Denis recommending Torx T10 fasteners (ideally countersunk) to keep deck plates sealed.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3520-L3539】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3867-L3879】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4083-L4114】
- Charging etiquette threads reiterated plugging the charger into the scooter before the wall outlet to reduce inrush sparks, advice Denis echoed alongside reminders that Rita automatically shares the stock charge port across both packs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4158-L4170】
- Denis reconfirmed Samsung 35E cells as his default (20 A-class) pick, noting that Rita shares load between packs so higher-current 25R cells are unnecessary for most builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4019-L4032】

### Stem Hardware, Bags & 3D Prints (Lines 9001‑9157)
- Riders solve wobbly Xiaomi stems with plastic shims or aftermarket locks such as Foldster Xlock/Phoenix kits, which bolt into the folding joint to eliminate play.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9003-L9015】
- When mounting Denis’ battery bag, keep 3D-printed brackets oriented correctly and check lever clearance—misaligned clamps can scratch the deck, and brake levers may need trimming so they cannot puncture the pack inside the bag.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9048-L9069】
- Oversize printable spacers can be rescaled per axis in your slicer before printing; expect knowledgeable makers to tweak STL scale or reduce the 23 mm extender down to the 10 mm rise a rider needed.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9140-L9149】
- LED strips and RGB diffusers can be sealed inside extender housings for weatherproof lighting, and ESP32/8266 controllers make animated lighting practical while protecting wiring inside the bag.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9305-L9316】

### External Battery Safety & Sourcing Guidance (Lines 9017‑9135, 9391‑9555)
- Denis stresses that pairing two 6S LiPo packs in series yields a 12S (≈44 V) battery that must include a proper BMS and dedicated 12S charger; attempting to run bare RC LiPos from the stock 10S charger is a fire risk and novice builders should avoid the experiment.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9017-L9028】
- His go-to Rita pack recommendation remains a 10S4P Samsung 35E build with a common-port BMS; riders can source safe cells from suppliers like nkon.nl or commission trusted builders rather than gamble on unverified AliExpress listings.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9023-L9028】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9091-L9096】
- Evaluating cheap packs requires expensive lab gear (Hyperion 1420 charger, 800 W PSU, load bank), so the group advises saving for reputable packs—quality vendors such as Denis, Rumi/MisterLithium, or Laudation deliver capacities close to spec whereas “60 Ah” listings are often scams.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9096-L9125】
- Builders debated common-port BMS options with UART/Bluetooth monitoring, reminding buyers to order the full UART485 adapter kit when they need both wired configuration and wireless telemetry.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9076-L9084】
- Range Boost kits remain plug-and-play for Xiaomi 1S models, but 12S “range + speed” kits demand a paid XiaoFlasher license to load 51 V-ready firmware; scooter dashboards only show accurate state of charge when both packs share the same series count (10S).【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9503-L9537】
- Denis’ BMS v3.0 (green EU edition) omits the fragile thermal fuse; the rest of the hardware is unchanged, though builders should note that removing the fuse means thermal runaway won’t self-isolate if the pack burns.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9464-L9483】
- Charging through the scooter port should stay near 2 A because the internal BMS handles that current; external packs can accept up to ~10 A directly, so Denis suggests buying a 3 A or larger dedicated charger for off-scooter use.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9451-L9457】

### Pack Assembly Practices & Inspection (Lines 9182‑9255, 9464‑9487, 10456‑10463)
- Denis shared an example of a dangerously assembled LG MJ1 pack—damaged sleeves, shorted groups, and misused fishpaper—highlighting why reputable builders avoid gluing insulation donuts on negative terminals and instead rely on proper current paths.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9182-L9254】
- Builders favor elastic but strong adhesives (e.g., quality silicone) to secure cells and confirmed Samsung 35E and LG MJ1 cells deliver reliable performance when welded with correct insulation strategy.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9213-L9230】
- Denis’ own custom 12S packs mix wide nickel for power buses with thinner strips for balance leads to fit inside Wildman cases—helpful inspiration for riders planning higher-capacity builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10456-L10463】

### Tire, Brake & Suspension Notes (Lines 9319‑9579, 10065‑10069, 10491‑10499)
- 10" pneumatic conversions smooth out bumps compared with stock 8.5" rubber, but installers must ensure rims run true and consider reinforcements like Monorim suspension; some riders reverted to 8.5" with Monorim for sharper handling.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9319-L9588】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10491-L10499】
- X-Tech semi-hydraulic brakes paired with 135 mm rotors may squeal until pads are aligned—clamp the caliper while holding the brake to center it, then fine-tune adjustment.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10065-L10069】
- Stem dampers and folding shims only work when bolts are tightened correctly; if silicon shims will not stay seated, inspect the latch and hinge hardware rather than relying on thicker pads.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9337-L9363】

### Logistics, Warranty & Sales Updates (Lines 9165‑9807, 9820‑9867)
- Denis relocated to a new workshop with limited mains capacity and now evaluates DC-powered welders or backup generators to avoid tripping breakers during pack production.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9165-L9183】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9282-L9299】
- He reiterated strict BMS warranty policies after forgetting a balance strip on one battery—Rita units remain warrantied because they are harder to miswire, but BMS buyers must prove defects weren’t installer-induced.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9634-L9649】
- Shipping reopened to Serbia via Polish Post with standard card payments, and London-area buyers can source Rita hardware locally through reseller @Kvarkas; UK 12S batteries land around €207 shipped after Denis’ brief vacation delay.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9820-L9867】
- Denis still refuses PayPal/eBay sales to avoid anti-seller chargeback policies, routing transactions through his Russian company while fulfilling from Poland.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9653-L9665】

### Rita Usage, Charging & Future Plans (Lines 9130‑9939, 10103‑10115)
- Rita should wake up even on low test packs; if an external battery reads only 27 V, raise it toward nominal voltage and ensure a common-port BMS before retrying because the controller treats sub‑32 V inputs as empty.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9130-L9135】
- Charging through Rita always tops up the internal pack first; to quick-charge externals you must unplug them and use a forthcoming XT30-to-charger adapter or a dedicated harness.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9918-L9927】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9924-L9927】
- Riders asked for higher-current fuses and data lines, but Denis prioritizes simplicity—next-gen packs will ship with BLE “smart BMS” telemetry instead of adding more Rita wires, and he teased future upgrades once mainstream demand is met.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9949-L9960】
- New installers should wait for a full 51 V charge before test rides to feel the 12S boost, and remember to patch regenerative settings (e.g., 4150) so higher voltage does not overdrive the controller.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10103-L10115】

### Firmware, Dashboards & Connectivity (Lines 9556‑10084, 10404‑10435)
- Upgrading to 12S with XiaoGen firmware can push M365 Pros past 43 km/h, but apps like M365 Tools will show zero watts because Rita emulates the scooter BMS; this is expected per Denis’ manual.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9556-L9565】
- Xiaomi 1S owners seeking more range should stick to 10S kits unless they are comfortable flashing firmware; XiaoFlasher (≈€6.99) supports Pro/Pro2 builds, but BLE 074 can lock dashboards unless reactivated with brake+throttle or the Mi app after a timeout.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9503-L9555】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10070-L10088】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10404-L10435】
- Storage tips remain standard: park packs near 3.7 V, avoid long stints in the cold, and expect Rita telemetry to toggle between batteries only when the external voltage exceeds the internal by roughly 0.5 V.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9892-L9903】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10476-L10490】
- Developers continue experimenting with custom dashboards (dual displays, Wi-Fi logging) and note that iOS tooling lags Android because of Apple’s developer program requirements.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9263-L9268】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9886-L10030】

### Components, Fasteners & Miscellaneous Tips (Lines 9404‑9917, 10004‑10029)
- Choose BMS boards that match your cell count—12S packs require dedicated 12S PCM/PCB modules rated for the current you plan (e.g., 30 A option for most Rita builds).【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9404-L9419】
- Keep 10" tire pressures high enough for stability and inspect heat when running higher-voltage controllers; 48 V conversions without Rita can overheat motors quickly, and regen voltage limits should be set near actual pack voltage to avoid faults.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9420-L9448】
- Xiaomi bottom-pan screws are M3 fasteners; replace stripped OEM hardware with better-quality bolts to survive repeated maintenance.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9916-L9917】
- Denis and others favor LG MJ1, Samsung 35E, and Sanyo cells for pack builds, referencing resources like lygte-info’s 18650 comparator to validate specifications.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10004-L10018】

### Ninebot G30 Insights & AWD Experiments (Lines 9070‑9075, 9687‑9699, 10043‑10063)
- Denis is considering a Ninebot G30/G30LP external battery bag; community feedback indicates Gen1 motors deliver better performance while Gen2 windings offer durability, so either hub suits high-power builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9070-L9075】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9687-L9695】
- AWD concepts (dual ESCs, relays for “turbo” switches) require respecting Rita’s ~30 A ceiling; builders often rely on separate controllers per motor rather than routing both through a single Rita harness.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9949-L9956】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10043-L10063】

### Sales & Fulfillment Developments (Late July–Early August 2020)
- Payment processing remained RUB-only with banks blocking PayPal support; Denis promised two-week timelines to resolve banking hurdles and manually confirmed shipments for orders stalled by card-processor quirks.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3013-L3021】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3091-L3101】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4449-L4484】
- Battery production paused August 1–10 while his pack builder took vacation and charger deliveries caught up; orders placed during that window ship once assembly restarts around August 10–15.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3520-L3596】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3742-L3757】
- Denis reminded buyers that his Wildman bag kits top out at roughly 20 cm pack lengths (≈25×7×7 cm bricks will not fit) and that support tickets should include order IDs so he can reconcile manual bank confirmations.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4407-L4448】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4449-L4484】

### Firmware Recovery, Controller Tuning & Experimental Mods (August 2020)
- Multiple riders bricked controllers while flashing 51 V-ready custom firmware; ST-Link recoveries succeed once pogo pins make firm contact with ESC pads and pinouts are confirmed—floating leads were the most common cause of failed reflashes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4641-L4676】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5111-L5149】
- Denis and moderators reiterated that 13S packs demand hardware changes: cut Rita’s pink sense wire, upgrade the controller, and expect limited guidance until official documentation catches up—most riders find 12S’s ~20 % boost ample.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4930-L4948】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5284-L5289】
- Veteran tuners cautioned against pushing past ~27 k current targets on stock controllers or mixing configuration generators; mismatched 33 k presets and ignored thermal upgrades have already destroyed MOSFETs despite moderate dashboard temperatures.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4950-L4974】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4988-L5008】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5986-L5999】
- Community engineers showcased a Ninebot G30 “delta mod” that rewires the stator from star to delta on demand for 55–66 km/h blasts; the experiment highlights how much stronger the G30 controller is compared to unreinforced M365 boards, which burned under the same load.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5035-L5073】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5085-L5096】

### Tire, Suspension & Folding Hardware Upgrades
- Riders endorsed CST V3 and Wanda 10" pneumatic tires with thicker tubes for heavy riders, noting that solid tires sap roughly 20 % more energy, reduce grip, and can still puncture tubes during install; proper pressure based on rider weight remains essential.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4524-L4588】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4730-L4743】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4750-L4793】
- X-Tech HB100 brake adopters shared pad part numbers, spacer advice, and rotor sizing (140 mm for Pro, 120 mm for base models) to ease conversions.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4589-L4726】

### Rita Configuration & High-Voltage Safeguards (Late August 2020)
- Denis reiterated that plugging 13S packs into Rita without cutting the dedicated jumper will destroy the adapter; riders must follow the official manual via the M365 BMS Tool and downgrade BLE to 090/074 for configuration before enabling higher cell counts.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7538-L7562】
- 13S builds still require controller-side preparation (reinforced traces and corrected voltage dividers); buyers of aftermarket ESCs should confirm those changes with the vendor rather than assuming compatibility.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7571-L7578】
- Returning to 10S operation after cutting the jumper is unsafe without restoring it; Denis urged riders not to exceed 12S until they fully understand the hardware protections described in the manual.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7956-L7975】
- Rita + Speed kits run on the Xiaomi Pro 2 when paired with Xiaoflasher’s paid firmware, but the community still cannot connect that scooter to the M365 BMS Tool, leaving configuration to other apps.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7976-L7980】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8100-L8101】

### Regeneration, Firmware & Controller Lessons
- Raising Rita’s “recuperation off cell voltage” threshold to about 4.15 V resolves throttle kicks on 12S/13S packs; Denis detailed how the parameter prevents regen until both batteries fall below the limit.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7914-L7927】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7801-L7809】
- Firmware “intensity of current change” values around 400 mA overstress controllers even with reinforced tracks; experienced tuners cap the step near 300–350 mA to preserve MOSFETs while keeping throttle response acceptable.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7822-L7835】
- Heavy regen presets such as CWF W can burn unreinforced controller traces within a few emergency stops, so builders combine modest braking-current settings with mechanical upgrades (larger rotors/X-Tech calipers).【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8843-L8849】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8865-L8875】
- Rita continues charging the external pack after the scooter powers down; riders should rely on the charger LED (green = full) to confirm completion.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7749-L7755】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7762-L7765】

### Logistics & Regional Availability Updates (Aug 26–Sep 1 2020)
- EU buyers reported three-day delivery from Poland and confirmed Denis’ 12S packs ship with YZPower chargers rated for 20 A continuous discharge, which tolerate short bursts above spec.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7669-L7682】
- Denis quoted roughly £290 delivered for a full 12S kit to the UK and about €325 to Finland, with no additional VAT/import fees inside the EU.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7930-L7941】
- Lithium batteries remain EU-only shipments: Norway and Turkey customers can order electronics or accessories, but battery orders lack shipping options because Denis cannot export packs there.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8102-L8130】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8857-L8860】

### Battery Quality, BMS Selection & Pack-Build Lessons
- AliExpress 10S packs with separate charge ports are incompatible with Rita’s charge-sharing—replace their BMS with a common-port board to avoid uncontrolled overcharge through the discharge leads.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8784-L8785】
- Quality packs cost at least ~€100 in materials before labor and taxes; Denis and other builders warned that cheaper imports often hide weak cells, poor BMS hardware, and abusive manufacturing practices.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8789-L8794】
- Denis’ repair BMS defaults to 4.15 V per cell (≈4.14 V after the internal diode drop) but allows users to raise or lower that ceiling for longevity or range goals.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8354-L8356】
- Dashboards reading ~91 % at 50.1 V on 12S packs are a UI quirk—the pack is effectively 99 % charged despite the lower display figure.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8184-L8188】
- Field tests showed Denis’ repair BMS sustaining 37 A for over 10 s when stacked with another 10S pack; the main limitation of earlier boards is a 3 A charge current, making dual chargers or patience necessary.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8377-L8387】
- Builders emphasized leaving the final few percent uncharged to prolong Li-ion life, and they urged adding insulation (fish paper or tape) when gluing dense packs to mitigate thermal and abrasion risks.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8343-L8352】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8804-L8816】

### Hardware Fitment, Maintenance & Instrumentation Tips
- Controller connector paste should be non-conductive thermal compound to aid heat transfer without risking shorts.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7513-L7519】
- Stuck front hub bolts demand a long, rigid wrench (not the soft Monorim tool), lubricant, and bracing the scooter with body weight; replace rounded fasteners with higher-grade hardware once removed.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8105-L8177】
- Monorim steering that binds after installation is usually overtightened—back the central stem bolt off a quarter turn, temporarily loosen the side clamps, or swap back to the stock bolt before reinserting the suspension pump.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8204-L8248】
- 10" conversions require relocating rear-light wiring, sealing edges with epoxy, and sometimes trimming mudguard plastics; riders settled around 4 bar rear/3.5 bar front to balance comfort and clearance.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8301-L8307】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8865-L8874】
- Some riders trim the rear deck reinforcement for extra clearance, but heavier owners prefer keeping the rib intact and instead rely on spacers and precise tire selection.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8901-L8918】
- Denis’ customers routinely relocate the charge port higher on the scooter and re-seal the deck to keep grime out once 10" tires and relocated wiring are installed.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8306-L8309】
- Bluetooth temperature loggers powered by CR2032 cells provide inexpensive real-time monitoring for experimental high-power packs and ESCs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8752-L8759】

### Lighting, Visibility & Range Accessories
- Helmet or backpack-mounted turn signals sit at eye level and remain visible in daylight, unlike low fender kits that other traffic may miss.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7501-L7522】
- Re-routing the rear light harness and potting connections protects the cable from 10" tire rubbing, while reflective tape or inexpensive sticker kits boost visibility without bulky add-ons.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8301-L8307】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8931-L8937】
- Multi-pack Rita adapters, anti-spark links, and backpack enclosures support dual 12S packs (~24.6 Ah, 6.1 kg) that can stretch range toward 80 km when carefully managed.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8316-L8321】
- Foldster/X-Lock clamps curb stem wobble on ESA clones and stock M365s alike; careful bag placement prevents latch interference, though cumulative upgrades quickly exceed the scooter’s purchase price.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5327-L5364】
- Front-suspension retrofits and printable mudguard brackets circulate on Thingiverse/Yeggi; builders recommended sourcing genuine Monorim parts from reputable EU sellers to avoid weaker clones and pairing the swap with 10" pneumatic conversions for best comfort.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5155-L5203】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5486-L5500】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5869-L5875】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5949-L5957】
- August chatter flagged 3D-printed suspension supports, Monorim sourcing tips, and lock extender kits that relocate the folding latch for better Wildman-bag clearance; genuine Monorim hardware remains scarce and pricier via EU resellers.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6122-L6195】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6481-L6512】
- Riders debated 10" conversions versus 8.5" setups—consensus favored 10" pneumatic tires for smoother rides and marginally higher top speed once firmware is tuned, provided braking upgrades (e.g., X-Tech) keep pace.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6743-L6767】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6769-L6787】

### Clone Scooter Compatibility & Upgrade Paths
- Doc Green/ESA owners confirmed Rita works in analog mode with the stock harness, but Bluetooth telemetry requires swapping to Xiaomi dashboards; full 12S performance typically means adopting the entire M365 controller, wiring loom, and dashboard to regain CFW support.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5198-L5284】
- Alibaba “KCQ” clones vary widely—Denis advised inspecting internals, confirming motor compatibility, or selling the copy to fund a genuine M365/M365 Pro when documentation is scarce.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5396-L5426】
- Denis’ repair BMS fits ESA-class clone battery bays without data lines, letting shops reuse analog frames or gradually migrate customers toward full Xiaomi electronics when telemetry is desired.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6336-L6356】

### Controller Cooling, Firmware & Charger Lessons (Mid-August 2020)
- Enthusiasts improved controller thermals by reapplying quality paste between MOSFETs and the aluminum housing, noting that Xiaomi enclosures already sit flush to the chassis once the OEM compound is replaced.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6001-L6033】
- Denis recommended LM2576HV/LM2596HV buck converters when powering 5 V accessories from scooter packs and reiterated that assembling a fresh battery shipment takes about three business days.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6077-L6084】
- 12S4P riders saw pack temps spike toward 50 °C when hammering hills after a fresh charge; easing firmware demand, letting packs rest after charging, or completing the 50.4 V charger mod kept temperatures in check.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6279-L6448】
- DIY charger mods should adjust the trimmer to 50.4 V—sloppy soldering or mistaking wood glue for silicone can cook the brick before it ever reaches Rita.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6541-L6546】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6775-L6781】

### Rita Configuration & Support Boundaries (Mid-August 2020)
- Community moderators reiterated Denis’ guidance for 13S builds: cut Rita’s pink jumper, raise CFW voltage limits (≈51 V for 12S, higher for 13S), and ignore legacy controller hacks that splice extra wires across cut traces.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6050-L6056】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6466-L6470】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6551-L6580】
- Denis drew a firm support boundary: miswired externals that blow Rita’s fuses or rely on non-common-port BMS boards are owner errors—send the adapter in for inspection only after verifying pack wiring.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6618-L6704】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6695-L6700】
- His M365 BMS Tool still needs BLE downgrades (072 for M365, 090 for Pro), and telemetry will flip between packs while charging because Rita reports whichever side leads by ~0.5 V.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6420-L6429】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6515-L6533】

### Bag Fitment & Hardware Adjustments
- Denis flagged two Wildman bag screws that can scuff his external packs; add soft padding over the shallow fasteners and mount packs with the power lead facing upward to protect the harness.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6360-L6361】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6463-L6465】
- Folding hooks that graze the bag can be trimmed or replaced with Monorim extender kits and X-Lock risers to restore clearance without sacrificing fold strength.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6450-L6512】

### Safety, Lighting & Visibility Ideas
- Community experiments showcased 3D-printed fender supports with integrated mudguards, wireless turn-signal pods, Lumos Matrix helmets, and plans for custom 12 V amber strobes—many riders prefer DIY strobes or wait for cheaper MIPS-equipped helmets over paying €240 for the official kit.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6122-L6124】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7400-L7476】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7462-L7472】

### Range Planning & Ride Etiquette Reminders
- A Rita-equipped M365 effectively multiplies range by ≈2.8× on base models and ≈2.1× on the Pro, making 24 km daily commutes feasible even for 130 kg riders who plan for higher-capacity packs and voltage matching before parallel connection.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4695-L4750】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5320-L5335】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5941-L5942】
- Riders stressed defensive habits at 30–40 km/h—wide bike lanes, predictable signaling, and extra caution at driveways—arguing that responsible behavior matters more than rigid 20 km/h caps once scooters share roads with cars and cyclists.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5553-L5576】

### Stem Hardware & Bag Clearance (Early September 2020)
- Plastic stem shims plus aftermarket Foldster X-Lock or Phoenix clamps remained the go-to cure for loose steering columns, and riders cautioned that trimmed latch levers and padded Wildman bags prevent hardware from gouging external batteries inside the case.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9003-L9069】
- Hot-gluing the rear-light connector shields it from road spray after 10" conversions, though worn mudguard screws may still need shop help to extract.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9330-L9338】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9334-L9344】

### Battery Safety, Cells & DIY Resources
- Denis clarified that pairing two 6 S LiPos only yields a 12 S (~44.4 V) pack, insisted on adding a proper BMS, forbade charging it with the stock 10 S brick, and told inexperienced builders to avoid RC LiPos altogether due to fire risk—suggesting NKON-sourced 18650 cells instead.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9017-L9024】
- For safe value builds he recommended a 10s4p Samsung 35E pack with a common-port BMS and pointed novices toward Micah Toll tutorials plus Vruzend prototyping kits before attempting welded packs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9027-L9038】

### Common-Port BMS Upgrades & Supplier Quality
- Builders converting third-party batteries to Rita compatibility swapped in AliExpress common-port boards (40 A UART485 models with Bluetooth modules) so they could monitor and configure packs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9076-L9084】
- When cheap packs lacked common ports, moderators steered riders toward Denis’ or MisterLithium’s assemblies and cited Laudation as one of the few Chinese suppliers that met its rated capacity, warning that sensational “60 000 mAh” listings are scams.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9091-L9100】

### Pack Construction Practices
- Denis and fellow builders debated fishpaper rings, agreeing they belong on positive terminals while negatives stay bare, noting that duplicating insulation on both sides adds labor without improving current handling.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9189-L9254】
- He removed the fragile thermal fuse from the green v3 repair BMS because customers kept bending it, stressing that the board otherwise remains unchanged even though it can no longer interrupt charge/discharge during a fire.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9464-L9483】
- Denis also confirmed that custom 12s4p packs use wide nickel for power paths and narrow strips for balance leads, whereas his production batteries ship as 12s3p modules sized for the Wildman bag.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10456-L10463】

### Charging & Storage Guidance
- External packs tolerate up to 10 A when charged directly, but Denis still caps the scooter’s charge port at 2 A (3 A bricks can stress the OEM BMS) and recommends buying a dedicated high-current charger if faster top-ups are required.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9451-L9455】
- Rita always tops the internal battery first when charging through the scooter port; Denis planned an XT30-to-Xiaomi charger adapter so riders can easily charge externals separately in the meantime.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9918-L9927】
- Long-term storage should leave packs around 3.7 V per cell and in warm spaces—cold garages age cells faster even if the scooter itself is indoors.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9892-L9903】

### Rita Roadmap & Telemetry Limits
- Denis reiterated that Rita omits a data line to keep wiring simple despite requests for thicker cables and higher fuses; he instead promised next-generation batteries with smart BLE BMS boards by summer 2021.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9954-L9960】
- Because of that design choice, M365 Tools cannot show external battery capacity—riders must match voltages and rely on BMS apps, and the scooter will display whichever pack sits higher.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10476-L10490】
- Anyone encountering repair-BMS error 21 should re-seat the white–yellow–green data ribbon before assuming the board failed.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9904-L9912】

### Kit Compatibility & Display Behaviour
- Denis confirmed the Xiaomi 1S Range Boost (10 S) kit is plug-and-play without firmware flashing, whereas the 12 S Range+Speed kit demands a paid XiaFlasher unlock; scooters only report accurate state-of-charge when both packs are 10 S because 12 S externals hold the gauge at 100 % until they drop to ~30 %.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9502-L9536】
- New 12 S installations should expect ≈51 V full-charge readings and zero-watt telemetry in M365 Tools—Rita’s current-sense design makes that behaviour normal.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9556-L9564】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10103-L10116】
- Denis also reminded speed seekers that motors overheat before quality batteries do, so hammering a low-state-of-charge pack with extra current is a recipe for fried drivetrains.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9850-L9852】

### Tuning, Thermal Management & Suspension Noise
- Riders were urged to wait for external packs to reach 50–51 V before riding, raise recuperation-disable voltage to 4.150 V, and increase power-constant values (e.g., 33 000–40 000) if controllers run hot—lower numbers hit harder but drive up heat on 12 S builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10107-L10188】
- Lithium grease borrowed from bicycle maintenance quiets Monorim suspension pivots and keeps water out better than light oils or dry lubricants.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10154-L10163】
- Voltage upgrades can expose thermal limits—several riders saw dramatic heat spikes after installing Rita, prompting reminders to dial back Sport-mode amps and monitor motors after firmware tweaks.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10090-L10098】

### Tire & Motor Notes
- 10" pneumatic swaps still earn praise for smoothing bumps, yet some members reverted to 8.5" rubber with Monorim V2 to avoid S-shaped wobbles seen on certain XuanCheng 10" casings and to regain sharper steering; heavier riders noted extra bouncing on imperfect roads.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9567-L9590】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10492-L10497】
- Ninebot Max experimenters felt the original "Gen1/type 6" motor pulled harder, while the newer "Gen2/type 9" winding should run cooler and last longer even if peak performance is slightly lower.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9687-L9695】

### Logistics & Support Updates (Early September 2020)
- Denis’ early-September queue promised dispatches on 8 and 14 September around a short holiday, quoted roughly €207 shipped for a 12 S battery to the UK, and confirmed Serbia orders now leave via Polish Post with standard Visa payments accepted.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9802-L9829】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9861-L9867】
- Batteries remained EU-only because of dangerous-goods rules—US buyers must self-source packs, and even Israeli customers were redirected to third-party builders while land transport handled EU deliveries.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9908-L9915】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10214-L10219】
- London riders could purchase Denis’ hardware locally through reseller Kvarkas instead of importing directly.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9835-L9837】

### Tools, Repairs & Warranty Handling
- Opening factory battery cases still demands brute force—Denis half-joked about “hammering” packs free and shared that BMS wiring photos already live in the chat media archive for reference.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9601-L9619】
- Community guides documented ST-Link recovery for bricked 1S/Pro2 dashboards, with members offering spare programmers while Denis reminded buyers the tool is inexpensive and widely stocked locally.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10207-L10255】
- After one missed balancing-strip solder joint, Denis reaffirmed that every Rita ships tested, his limited BMS warranty excludes user-damaged boards, and he declines to sell through buyer-biased platforms like PayPal or Amazon.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9634-L9657】

### New Insights from Lines 22001–27000

#### Power & Firmware Tuning
- Community mentors reiterated core physics: higher pack voltage raises achievable speed while torque stems from available current and coil resistance, so capacity (mAh) only extends runtime when paired with cells that can actually supply the amps riders demand.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L22020-L22046】
- Cold autumn temperatures still sap performance by inducing extra voltage sag, a change riders immediately feel even when launching with a warm battery from indoors.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L22467-L22471】
- Stock Xiaomi controllers stay healthiest around 25–26 A sport-mode limits; testers found that “smooth” throttle curves add perceptible lag, while linear/instant algorithms with 100–200 mA current steps deliver crisp response without the excess heat produced by higher current-step values.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L22206-L22238】
- Reference data from the Russian Xiaogen community quantifies the current-raising coefficient at 0.005 s per 300 mA step; calculations shared later in the thread confirmed that chasing 800 mA steps only adds stress for negligible launch gains.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L22318-L22318】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L23327-L23335】
- The Monorim 500 W hub continues to attract group buys (≈€80 shipped) because it tolerates more current without overheating; paired with 13 S tunes riders logged ~54 km/h peaks, though they emphasized the swap mainly boosts torque rather than raw top speed.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L22345-L22354】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L22245-L22260】
- Field trials showed that even reinforced controllers can run warm at 24–29 A when hauling 150 kg loads, so heavy riders should keep thermal paste fresh and watch temps during extended hill climbs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L22471-L22478】

#### Battery & Rita Configuration
- Denis warned that Rita must be reconfigured every time riders swap between 10 S and 12 S externals—mis-matched settings disable electric braking or, in the opposite case, can blow the adapter or controller—and external packs must sit a few tenths of a volt above the internal battery for Rita telemetry to appear.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L22735-L22744】
- Mixed-pack owners reported that once a 12 S external drops to ~41 V the scooter begins drawing from both packs, leaving roughly a stock pack’s worth of range in reserve even after 30 km of spirited riding.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L22929-L22936】
- BMS Tool firmware v5—which Denis temporarily withdrew because it requires a 4.180 V recovery limit the app cannot yet expose—adds protection against regen over-voltage events that previously scorched a few adapters; he plans to ship new units with v5 preloaded.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L23015-L23031】
- Denis still defaults to Samsung 35E cells purchased through nkon.nl, noting that refurbished lots are safe for personal builds and that 21700 formats shine when space is tight and budget allows a premium pack.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L22583-L22586】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L22680-L22687】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L22576-L22577】
- Misconfigured dashboards that still display 100 % at 41 V betray Rita units left in 10 S mode; Denis replaced one such adapter under warranty and reminded riders to disable strong KERS or risk tripping Rita’s safeguards when a 12 S pack is freshly charged.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L23593-L23606】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L23559-L23566】

#### Hardware, Thermal & Diagnostics
- Riders who spread high-quality thermal paste between controller and deck (instead of soft pads) saw 4–5 km/h speed gains at the same amp draw, with temps holding under ~45 °C even on 12 S builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L22966-L22967】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L23086-L23090】
- Stock Pro harnesses began melting when firmware pushed 29 A through factory connectors, reinforcing prior advice to stay ≤27 A on OEM hardware or hard-solder phase leads before chasing bigger numbers.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L22381-L22382】
- Water-damaged controllers typically lose their 5 V rail; the group’s diagnostic flow involves probing the dash socket, checking the U4 buck regulator, and resealing every cable entry with silicone once repairs finish.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L22825-L22902】
- Denis’ soldering safety refresher—never cut both XT30 leads simultaneously—joined reminders to keep spare connectors on hand when rebuilding full packs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L22709-L22718】
- Enthusiasts debating star/delta rewiring for Ninebot Max motors concluded that while delta mode can unlock 50–60 km/h at 36 V, it demands meticulous switching hardware and beefier controllers to offset the torque loss per amp.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L23478-L23558】

#### Tires, Suspension & Frame
- Budget fork kits that mount to G30s can raise the front end nearly 10 cm; veterans still favor Monorim assemblies, especially because reversing the forks is an easy way to clear wider custom motors on front-wheel conversions.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L22972-L22979】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L23118-L23123】
- Monorim’s 500 W hub expects solid rubber, and riders advised sticking to quality 10" solids (or mixing solid front/pneumatic rear) while avoiding harsh 8.5" blocks that slash speed and range.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L23128-L23151】
- Brake feel improved noticeably after rerouting cables under the deck with fresh low-friction housing and bleeding X-Tech calipers using mineral oil; the revised layout also let controllers sit flush for better cooling.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L22432-L22435】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L22746-L22751】
- Monorim and EXA suspension wobble complaints usually trace back to worn bearings—Tudor and others recommended replacing top and bottom races after a year of heavy riding to restore stability.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L23621-L23644】
- Stripped deck threads can take the next size up (e.g., M3.5×10 mm) because the stock baseplate is soft aluminum, letting older scooters regain a watertight seal.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L23160-L23164】

#### Series Boosters, Charging & Legal Notes
- Builders experimenting with 2–3 S booster packs stressed that these modules must be wired in series via a Y-harness, charged separately to exactly match the internal battery, and monitored closely because any voltage imbalance will force uncontrolled cross-charging—an argument for buying another Rita kit instead.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L23172-L23208】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L23222-L23237】
- Reinforced VTA controllers can accommodate 13 S builds once Rita’s jumper is cut; owners reported 45–50 km/h “in air” speeds with 10" tires, underscoring the need for helmets and staged firmware flashing to avoid over-voltage boot loops.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L23253-L23257】
- UK riders reminded newcomers that private-use scooters remain illegal on public roads—penalties include points, fines, impound fees, and higher insurance—so discretion and compliant behavior matter even with stealthy upgrades.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L22051-L22055】

### New Insights from Lines 32001–37000

#### Braking, Tires & Chassis
- Veteran tuners reiterated that Rita should stay below 30 A continuous (≈40 A only in brief bursts) and that the mechanical brake must remain the primary stopper; chasing higher electronic braking currents has already snapped 180 A MOSFET legs during panic stops on 500 W builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L32010-L32030】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L36055-L36107】
- Organic pads fade under repeated high-speed stops, so faster riders migrate to sintered or ceramic compounds despite their faster rotor wear; riders pursuing dual discs can split a single lever’s cable into two housings and synchronize the pull lengths.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L32022-L32070】
- Pro 2 owners hunting 6-bolt rotors must confirm the hub pattern before buying MTB discs, because classic M365 rims only carry five bolts.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L32043-L32050】
- Tudor is prototyping a Monorim 500 W brake adapter but will only machine it once roughly 20 riders commit; early adopters are already coordinating bulk orders for the motors and hardware.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L32080-L32114】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L37001-L37033】
- Removing stock tires is easier once the side plate comes off—the hub and rubber slide off together—and riders swapping to 10" solids are reminded to match inner diameter and width before trimming metal.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L36010-L36034】
- Installing Deli 10×2" rubber on 1S/Pro 2 frames demands relocating the rear-light connector, extending wiring, or filing the frame tabs; many owners cut the connector flange, reroute the cable, and reseal with hot glue or deck grommets to clear the carcass.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L36292-L36349】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L36360-L36453】
- Mountain-bike cockpit swaps require adapters that convert Xiaomi’s oval stem to a round clamp; relocating the BLE/display is part of the job when chasing stronger bars.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L36023-L36035】
- Riders found Xiaomi’s newer frames packed with foam that must be dug out before running extra cabling or swapping motors.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L36360-L36363】
- Monorim 500 W motors that start vibrating after a 45 km/h emergency stop usually point to controller damage rather than bearings; inspect Rita’s braking current, VTA MOSFET mounting pressure, and thermal paste coverage before condemning the hub.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L36049-L36076】
- Community members now coat controller fasteners with medium-strength thread locker and replace kapton tape under MOSFETs with high-conductivity pads to even out pressure and improve heat transfer.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L33211-L33216】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L36947-L36966】
- Mineral oil fills beat 3D-printed fins for cooling sealed hubs—just be ready to reseal the case carefully to prevent leaks.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L37032-L37039】

#### Battery Planning & Range
- Rita always favors the pack sitting at the higher voltage and only shares current once the external and internal batteries match, so keep auxiliary packs slightly above the internal if you want them to shoulder the load first.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L35010-L35015】
- Mentors reframed current, voltage, and Watt-hours for newcomers: voltage raises speed, amps add torque, and a 13 S4 P Samsung 35E pack (672 Wh) more than doubles an M365’s 280 Wh stock capacity; keep throttle current intensity near 100 mA for controllable launches.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L35019-L35045】
- Switching between 12 S and 14 S externals demands reconfiguring Rita every time; Denis’ earlier warning still applies—charge higher-voltage packs off-scooter so the 10 S internal BMS never sees over-voltage, and expect to adjust settings whenever you swap chemistries.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L34061-L34085】
- XT30 hardware remains adequate for 13 S–14 S builds at the group’s current levels, but riders eyeing 14 S rails should budget time to update Rita profiles and charger leads whenever they switch configurations.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L34088-L34094】
- Builders confirm that roughly 48 18650 cells fit a Wildman bag, enabling 14 S3 P shoulder packs, but the short runtime of 3 P stacks still nudges heavy riders toward 13 S setups or more parallels for balance.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L34101-L34105】
- Mixing 10 S internals with 13–14 S externals on Rita is feasible when the packs are charged separately and the adapter is retuned each time; skipping those steps risks uneven voltages or Rita refusing to brake.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L36264-L36278】
- Expect 500 W motors to draw the full 32 A programmed in Xiaogen once supplied by larger packs—start closer to 29 A on 4 P batteries, monitor controller temps, and increase only if the hardware stays cool.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L35087-L35109】

#### Firmware, Tools & Troubleshooting
- Use standard DownG for BLE 073 and DRV 1.5.5, then the Xiaogen-modded DownG APK for the custom ZIP; Xiaoflasher cannot program Xiaogen bundles directly, and BLE lives on the dashboard, not the controller.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L34015-L34037】
- Stock Pro 2 dashboards dislike aggressive downgrades—keep a USB ST-Link handy before flashing, because failed BLE writes leave only a flashing tail light until you restore firmware via clips.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L33012-L33084】
- iOS owners still need an Android device (or emulator) for scooterhacking apps; Apple’s policies block the necessary sideloading, leaving ST-Link reflashes as the alternative.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L34331-L34354】
- BLE 074 remains the stable pick for Pro dashboards, while BLE 073 v6 can behave erratically even after tweaks; power-cycle stubborn boards between flashes to clear connection bugs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L36280-L36290】
- VTA controllers ship with ESC 1.5.5 and tolerate Pro 2 hardware, but you cannot safely drop those dashboards to BLE 090; stay on modern BLE builds and flash Xiaogen twice if needed for a clean install.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L37003-L37009】
- Tudor offers express replacement shipping (≈1–2 days) and is bench-testing his boards past 60 V, giving builders confidence to explore 14 S setups once they tame braking currents.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L36112-L36118】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L36127-L36134】
- Handheld wattmeters with XT30 leads cost ~€10 and log charge/discharge current; adding longer cables lets riders monitor draw from the handlebar without upsetting KERS.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L35061-L35075】

### New Insights from Lines 37001–42000

#### Firmware, BLE & Controller Guidance
- VTA controllers shipping with ESC 1.5.5 work on Pro 2 hardware, but the dash cannot be downgraded to BLE 0.90—keep the stock BLE 129 and either stay on DRV 1.5.5 or move to 2.2.3 before flashing Xiaogen builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L37003-L37010】
- If a scooter stays dark after adding Rita, disconnect the dashboard and short the second-bottom and top pins to confirm the ESC still powers up, inspect the controller underside for blown traces, and, if needed, probe it with an ST-Link to verify 5 V rail health.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L38049-L38056】
- Camilo’s BLE 074 v7 firmware brings a dashboard slow mode, throttle filtering, and extra telemetry, but riders on Xiaogen/power-control tunes have seen sluggish launches or unplanned slow-mode engagement; until a fix lands, toggle cruise off or revert to earlier BLE revisions that behave predictably.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L38057-L38066】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L38102-L38109】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L38172-L38185】
- Series-boosting a 10 S pack with an extra 3 S module can trip safety cut-offs on hills as voltage sags or BMS/firmware limits are exceeded; monitor current with M365 Dashboard graphs and rein in CFW amp draws before re-enabling the booster.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L38086-L38103】
- Rita still needs matching over-voltage controller firmware for 13 S/15 S experiments—follow Denis’ manuals, set the proper 63 V ceiling, and confirm the controller can tolerate the target voltage before expecting the adapter to clear error 24.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L40520-L40547】

#### Battery, BMS & Charging Practices
- Pro 2 owners continue to swap their stock BMS 126 boards for BMS 128 units, reporting a closer match to the higher-capacity pack that ships with the scooter.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L37189-L37190】
- A 350 W motor on a Xiaomi 1S with the OEM 10 S4 P battery can reach ~40 km/h but already heats the pack to ~40 °C at 6 °C ambient, nudging riders toward Rita-managed 12 S externals and higher-parallel builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L37064-L37070】
- Internal pack planners mapped the space for denser builds: 13 S5 P 18650 assemblies fit a Pro deck without relocating electronics, while 13 S7 P or 12 S4 P packs based on 21700 cells typically need 20–25 mm deck extensions to clear the casing; Tudor’s guidance helps size custom nickel layouts before ordering cells.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L37238-L37299】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L37294-L37313】
- One builder pairing a 10 S4 P 21700 internal with Denis’ external pack already sees ~65 km of flat-ground range at 20 km/h and expects roughly 85 km once the higher-capacity core is welded.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L38067-L38075】
- Rita can charge external packs that lack a common-port BMS, but Denis’ team warns that protection and balancing thresholds aren’t enforced—charge those packs directly through their own port to stay safe.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L38117-L38122】
- The adapter purposely emulates –10 °C after a full charge to disable KERS and defaults to a 29 Ah capacity value, so jumping gauges and “missing” watt readings in M365 Tools are normal when Rita controls the data line.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L40092-L40095】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L40776-L40797】
- When a smart BMS reports one parallel group drifting, Denis advises verifying cell authenticity and checking voltages with a multimeter—bad cells are rare but easier to spot before they torch the pack’s usable range.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L40162-L40175】

#### Motor Upgrades & Performance
- Francois details the proven mineral-oil cooling mod: add roughly 50 ml of 10W-40 (or similar) inside the hub, seal the cover, axle, and harness exits with automotive sealant, and keep the stator sideways until the seal cures to prevent leaks.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L37037-L37053】
- Monorim 500 W riders confirmed the firmware still caps phase current at ≈2× battery amps, limiting low-speed torque until future updates expose higher phase-current ratios.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L37058-L37062】
- Several owners report vibration bands around 35–38 km/h on 500 W builds; the noise fades once speed climbs, suggesting controller tuning or CFW/BLE interactions rather than bearing failures.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L38352-L38368】

#### Tires, Brakes & Chassis Fitment
- CST 10×2.25 tires sized for 152 mm rims refuse to seat on Xiaomi’s 155 mm wheels and can foul the frame even if forced—reselling or swapping to scooter-specific casings saves hours of trimming.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L37076-L37080】
- Monorim’s 500 W tire options remain finicky: some owners moved to 8" rubber or hunted alternatives after wobble-induced crashes, noting the motor bay leaves little clearance for standard pneumatic casings.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L40114-L40123】
- Riders have squeezed CST 10×2.5" tires onto Pro/1S frames without cutting the deck, but centering the carcass is tedious and still benefits from suspension to clear the extra width.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L40177-L40186】
- Xtech calipers paired with Monorim hubs respond best to 135–140 mm rotors and matched adapters so the pads sweep the full braking surface.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L41010-L41013】

#### Logistics & Community Notes
- Denis flagged that all regular-post parcels bound for the UK or France after 28 October were stuck in transit, likely thanks to lockdown and Brexit backlogs, so customers should expect delays or spring for UPS.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L37175-L37187】
- The refreshed M365 Tools/Rita app hit Google Play in mid-December, giving Pro 2 owners an official download path after the sideloadable beta, while Denis reiterated he still cannot ship complete battery kits outside the EU (e.g., to Qatar).【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L39984-L40001】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L40801-L40805】

### New Insights from Lines 42001–47000

#### Battery Diagnostics, Building & Parallel-Pack Safety
- A 12S4P pack that shows one group sagging 0.12–0.3 V under load should be torn down, with each cell tested individually; builders keep RC chargers handy, suspect weak Sanyo GA cells, and are prepared to swap in a fresh BMS if traces or sense leads prove faulty.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L42092-L42138】
- Spot-welding prep matters: use magnets to pin nickel strips so the tongs can land flat, add insulating fish-paper on positive ends, and expect to revisit weld layouts until the busbars sit flush instead of bowed under constant stress.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L42200-L42213】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L42274-L42278】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L43489-L43577】
- Riders comparing Aerdu and other third-party packs stress the need for common charge/discharge ports when pairing with Rita; separate-port BMS boards demand off-scooter charging and elevate regen risks even if KERS is disabled.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L42301-L42333】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L42610-L42667】
- Paralleling batteries without Rita still works when voltages match, but community veterans warn that bypassing charge-mode firmware or mixing capacities can leave one pack dragging the other—Rita remains the safer option once budgets allow.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L42700-L42709】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L43217-L43233】
- Denis continues to dismiss suspicious AliExpress “13S” packs, pointing shoppers toward his own Samsung 35E builds (e.g., 13.8 Ah Wildman-compatible externals at €230) and the official store for dependable chargers and accessories.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L42520-L42547】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L43278-L43290】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L43423-L43437】

#### Rita Configuration, Firmware & App Support
- Rita firmware v5 upgrades arrive through the Google Play BMS Tool once an external battery is plugged in; the adapter fakes a –10 °C reading to kill KERS after charges and its voltage telemetry only needs to hover near 42 V to manage regen cutoff.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L42279-L42290】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L42698-L42712】
- Swapping external packs of the same series count needs no reconfiguration, but changing from 10S to 12S demands updating Rita’s serial-cell setting before riding; otherwise KERS limits or temperature warnings will interrupt acceleration until voltages settle.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L42546-L42559】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L42800-L42812】
- Third-party dashboards such as m365dash block BLE traffic during updates; disconnecting them (or switching into update mode) restores Rita access so firmware downgrades like BLE 072 can proceed.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L43460-L43505】
- M365dash developers released beta firmware to better display Rita’s 13S data, but Alex and others still see 12-cell readouts until they flash the 2.0.9 BIN via Wi-Fi and restart the scooter.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L42873-L42976】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L43236-L43257】

#### Motors, Controllers & Performance Projects
- Tudor announced internal 13S4P, 13S7P, and 15S5P packs for the Xiaomi Pro (the latter two needing 23 mm deck extenders) and is pairing 30 Ah 13S batteries with dual 500 W hubs and VESC controllers to hit ~3 kW while keeping torque-focused gearing.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L42340-L42386】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L42562-L42577】
- High-current BMS hardware remains bulky—120 A units rival GPU dimensions—so experimenters chasing 60 A+ builds weigh 140 A VESC controllers, larger spacers, and even 20S battery plans before stepping up to karts or bikes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L42395-L42429】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L42430-L42444】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L43300-L43326】
- Ninebot Max builders report UPS-friendly shipping from Tudor, ongoing customs paperwork, and first tests of AWD conversions using 13S60A packs, while others plan 48 V monorim motors that target 50 km/h once matched with 10" tires.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L42351-L42363】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L43064-L43118】
- Monorim 500 W owners compare top speeds (~45 km/h on 13S3P) and note Pro 2 firmware still enforces ~53 km/h cutoffs; reverting ESC firmware or running 350 W hubs on Xiaogen tunes can bypass the cap at the risk of higher heat.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L42418-L42425】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L43348-L43405】

#### Tires, Brakes & Chassis Fitment
- Brake modders are benchmarking 120/135/140 mm rotor setups, sharing adapter stack heights, and planning pad comparison guides once resin and semi-metallic shipments arrive; early verdicts favor 135 mm rotors to avoid rim rub.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L42049-L42063】
- Installing 10" tires on Monorim hubs requires careful drilling but pays off in stability; builders still hunt for rain-friendly tread, experiment with oil cooling inside 500 W motors, and monitor vibration above 35 km/h.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L42534-L42547】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L42669-L42689】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L43064-L43095】
- Xtech hydraulic calipers remain the go-to upgrade: riders bin the stock pads, favor golden semi-metallic replacements for wet grip, and remind others to bleed with mineral oil only; braking leverage still depends on 120–160 mm rotor choices and precise adapter shimming.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L42769-L42788】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L43162-L43216】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L43203-L43211】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L43550-L43555】

#### Logistics, Pricing & Community Updates
- Tudor confirms he can ship batteries to the US via UPS (with customs invoices starting January 2021) and continues to stock cable grommets, brackets, and silicone plugs for tidy deck routing.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L42351-L42361】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L43125-L43138】
- Denis reiterates that the Range kit roughly doubles mileage even for 120 kg riders and that 30–35 km/h cruising is plenty once weather and policing realities sink in.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L42704-L42727】
- Community members trade STL files for 20 mm deck extenders, caution each other against nordbot.xyz batteries, and share visualization tools (repackr, e4bike) for planning custom cell layouts before welding.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L42352-L42359】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L43419-L43429】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L43451-L43457】

### New Insights from Lines 47001–52000

#### Firmware, Debugging & Tools
- Error 27 on a Pro 1 pointed back to the controller serial embedded in custom firmware; Denis advised reflashing and double-checking the serial rather than replacing hardware.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47003-L47013】
- When wiring an internal battery without a data line, Denis reiterated that Rita must run in permanent BMS-emulator mode and the pack still needs its own charging plug to stay safe.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47011-L47012】
- Pro 2 owners chasing full-capacity charges can flash BMS126, but Denis recommends plugging into the BMS directly for firmware swaps rather than going through Rita.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47017-L47019】
- A detailed MOSFET test flow walked riders through using a multimeter’s diode mode to charge the gate, check the drain-source drop, discharge through a finger, and inspect drivers if any device reads short—handy for diagnosing 12 S brake-induced shutdowns.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47186-L47203】
- Denis still ranks paid XiaoFlasher first for generating firmware, with scooterhacking.org as a free alternative and XiaoGen as a third option; until hardware repairs finish, keep 12 S scooters on conservative Xiaogen defaults and just adjust voltage limits.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47246-L47254】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47215-L47218】
- Classic cable-disc brakes tighten via the barrel adjuster for fine tweaks and the caliper’s hex bolt for coarse moves; veterans also remind riders to verify pad life if levers start bottoming out.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47334-L47352】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47348-L47349】

#### Batteries, Charging & Thermal Management
- Denis steered newcomers toward 12 S externals because 13 S+ packs demand controller mods (heavier capacitors, IRFB4110 MOSFETs, reinforced traces, and updated resistors such as R30/R41); Šomi’s cheat sheet lists 13 S ≈28 kΩ/130 kΩ, 14 S ≈30 kΩ/140 kΩ, and 15 S ≈33 kΩ/150 kΩ for the power-on divider.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47255-L47286】
- Cold-weather riding chatter confirmed Samsung-based packs should avoid charging below 0 °C; riders noted that gentle 20 km/h cruising barely warms the pack, so downhill regen and heavy draws should stay limited until the cells heat themselves.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47023-L47038】
- DIY battery heaters proved underwhelming: 5 V/10 W pads barely raise cell temps unless the pack is heavily insulated, so some owners prefer pulling 30–40 A briefly to self-heat while watching Rita’s 30 A limit.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47354-L47396】
- Rita comfortably works with 12 S6 P builds on 30 A BMS boards, though the community reminds everyone that a BMS’s amp rating doesn’t dictate output—Rita’s 30 A design ceiling still applies.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47380-L47386】
- Users hunting 15 S batteries were told to source common-port packs with integrated BMS boards (AliExpress/Alibaba) and to expect higher voltage alongside more available current as parallels increase.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47306-L47314】
- LiitoKala’s “21 Ah” packs drew fresh warnings after one teardown showed uncertified 2200 mAh cells, misleading capacity stickers, and poor quality control; disappointed buyers vowed to stick with Denis’ Samsung builds despite shipping limits.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47493-L47511】
- Blue LEDs locked solid on a Pro battery usually mean opening the housing to reset or inspect the BMS—condensation and controller faults can mimic pack failures, so start with a physical reset before assuming the battery is dead.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L48130-L48148】
- External packs should be crimped or soldered securely; riders sharing burnt XT30/phase connectors now squeeze terminals tight or hard-solder them, add thermal paste under the controller, and swap kapton tape for insulating thermal pads to keep temperatures below ~60 °C.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47943-L47949】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L48218-L48240】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L48311-L48337】
- Temperature management tips included coating controllers with PCB varnish for splash resistance, torquing screws evenly so the case seats flat, and targeting thermal shutdowns near 65 °C to protect MOSFETs—88 °C spikes on stock ECUs were deemed risky.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L48311-L48337】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L48424-L48458】
- Recommended consumables for cooler builds now include high-conductivity pastes (e.g., Phobya NanoGrease) and 0.5–1 mm Gelid-style silicone pads to replace the factory kapton insulator under MOSFETs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L48619-L48636】

#### Controllers, Powertrains & Performance
- VTA controllers continue to handle 35 A daily and even 65 A bursts on 13 S builds when paired with thicker wiring, but pushing 45 A through thin phase leads melted connectors—tight crimps and heavier cables remain mandatory before chasing high currents.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47320-L47333】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L48220-L48255】
- Monorim and other aftermarket controllers exist for dual-motor builds; Monorim’s upcoming unit reportedly drives two hubs from one ECU, while Francois’ AWD scooter still splits current across twin controllers at ~65 A combined without overheating.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L48090-L48099】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47994-L48009】
- Rita’s 40 A fuse leaves little headroom: users logging 39 A spikes on 13 S13 P packs warn that torque gains plateau past ~35 A on a single Xiaomi hub, so most settle near 32 A for longevity.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47974-L48005】
- Stock controllers can survive brief 12 S use if you keep currents around 25 A and disable aggressive KERS; once reinforced tracks and upgraded components are in place, XiaoGen or custom firmware can raise limits cautiously.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47208-L47218】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47213-L47216】
- Controllers overheating to 88 °C on long climbs should be derated or upgraded (e.g., VTA or Paolo builds); community consensus pegs 60–65 °C as the safe ceiling for stock hardware even with 36 V packs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L48294-L48337】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L48424-L48458】

#### Tires, Suspension & Brakes
- Xuancheng 10" tires remain the go-to upgrade: they mount easily with baby powder, reuse the OEM 8.5" tube, run happily at 45–50 PSI, and last ~700 km when genuine (look for the factory label).【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47423-L47451】
- Smaller M365/1S frames may need grinding or bending to clear 10" rubber, whereas Pro frames usually fit without trimming; installers often file the mudguard bracket or flex the stays to stop rubbing.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47454-L47467】
- Monorim owners report some solid tires deforming under heavy torque—preheating tight solids in a 100 °C oven and enlisting a helper eases installation, but many are eyeing pneumatic replacements or alternative compounds for better feel.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47938-L47974】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L48065-L48073】
- Front mudguards on Monorim suspension can kiss 10" wheels; removing spacer foam, shortening screws, or swapping to different brackets buys a few millimeters of clearance.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L48047-L48058】
- Brake upgrades keep pace with power: riders are ditching e-brake sensors that pop controllers at 45 km/h, switching to full-hydraulic systems (Shimano/Magura), and upgrading to tougher bicycle-grade cables when sticking with mechanical setups.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L48536-L48563】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L48441-L48449】

#### Community & Logistics Notes
- Shipping lithium packs to markets such as the UK and Australia remains difficult; some UK builders like Tudor offer local battery fabrication while others lobby for legalization via petitions.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47265-L47290】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L48272-L48289】
- Legal climates stay strict in Germany (20 km/h caps, required insurance) and France (police still catching up on scooter rules), nudging riders to conceal modifications and ride cautiously.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47029-L47038】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L47506-L47509】

### Lines 52001–57000

#### Firmware, Debugging & Tools
- Stock VTA controllers now refuse Xiaogen firmware unless you spoof a compatible serial; riders lean on the web SN changer with the `21886/00XXXXXX` pattern, flash via modded M365 DownG, and keep an ST-Link V2 on hand in case the first pass bricks the dashboard.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L52054-L52087】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L52122-L52171】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L52165-L52169】
- 1S owners moving to 12 S externals downgrade to `mp365_drv221_1s` and `mp365_ble129_1s` before loading a 51 V custom firmware in XiaoFlasher, then bump sport-mode current to ~25 A, keep eco at 15 A, disable KERS, and monitor temps with M365 Dashboard; skipping those steps left one rider with a dead controller until it was reflashed and revived over ST-Link.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L52990-L53044】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L53095-L53128】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L53172-L53229】
- Rita requires the external pack to sit a little higher in voltage than the internal pack before M365 BMS Tool will talk to it, and Denis warns that leaving the wrong cell-count configured can either disable electric braking (12 S pack while set to 10 S) or even damage the module (10 S pack while set to 12 S).【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L53368-L53370】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L53413-L53416】
- To protect the ESC from over-voltage spikes, Rita fakes a sub-zero battery temperature whenever pack voltage is high—expect a brief cold-temp warning on the dash until you burn off the top of charge, at which point KERS re-enables automatically.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L56084-L56103】
- The adapter’s PCB still needs the red charge lead even if you reroute the main positive; Denis retracted earlier advice after confirming the board draws power there, so keep both positive feeds attached.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L53067-L53090】
- Wireless anti-theft relays slot into the BLE’s 5 V feed: run the controller’s red/black pair into the relay’s “in,” send the out pair back to the dash, and avoid trying to switch the high-current battery line directly.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L53624-L53646】
- Rita’s BMS-emulation should stay enabled even on analog packs—experienced builders warn that disabling BMS data on mixed batteries removes Rita’s safeguards and should only be done with careful voltage monitoring.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L53736-L53779】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L54289-L54299】

#### Batteries, Charging & Thermal Management
- A €110 Chamrider 13 S 3 P pack (≈9.6 Ah real capacity) fits Denis’ external bag and pushed a 10"/350 W setup to GPS-verified 47 km/h; riders also flagged Aerdu’s 10 S 14 Ah pack as a budget option while noting it ships without a plastic cell cage.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L54014-L54045】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L54046-L54053】
- Rita users mixing 10 S internal and external packs reported 30 km of eco riding before both sat at 36 V, credited to the adapter balancing draw and letting the external charge to 42 V; remember to update capacity estimates (e.g., 7800 mAh stock + 10 350 mAh speed pack = 18 150 mAh) inside the app.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L53087-L53112】
- Dual-12 S builds showed 51–52 km/h on the dash (≈48 km/h logged), while 12 S-only 500 W conversions still cruise at ~44 km/h, illustrating the speed gains voltage adds even before motor swaps.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L53020-L53044】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L53638-L53646】
- Cheap AliExpress packs deserve scrutiny: one “Samsung” external suffered a catastrophic street burnout on its first ride, and techs now judge pack health by cell delta (≤0.011 V spread beats wider imbalances).【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L56954-L56986】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L56943-L56952】

#### Controllers, Powertrains & Performance
- Monorim’s 1000 W hubs arrive with thin leads—builders drill valve holes for tubes, swap to HXT 4 mm connectors, and treat the 1000 W version as the torque choice while the 1200 W tubeless hub targets top speed (claimed ~65 N·m). Shipping two big hubs privately costs roughly $300–350, whereas Kroxne/VTA group buys absorb duties and logistics.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L52334-L52347】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L52481-L52505】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L52737-L52748】
- Experimental delta/star rewinds promise 50 km/h from a 36 V pack at ~700 W by switching coil topology mid-ride, but a prototype already blew a controller during a 43 km/h pull—treat the concept as bleeding-edge tinkering for now.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L52553-L52608】
- Veterans still recommend 12 S as the ceiling for stock controllers: stacking a 6 S booster on a 10 S pack effectively creates 16 S and demands upgraded capacitors and MOSFETs, whereas Denis’ 12 S kits deliver ~40 km/h with manageable thermal loads.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L56639-L56710】
- Community tuning targets remain conservative—Xiaogen users aim near 27 000 mA motor current and ≤30 A brake regen on unreinforced boards to keep controllers alive over thousands of kilometers.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L53899-L53908】

#### Tires, Suspension & Brakes
- Converting Monorim motors to air tires means drilling a careful valve hole and ordering angled stems; slicks and other 10" options are available, but many ditch the bundled solids because they wear quickly under high torque.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L52737-L52748】
- Konyk rear suspension remains the premium choice—expect ~€85 for the bare linkage or ~€150 with an EXA A5 air shock—while cheaper ESparts/Monorim combos plus ZGhua 10" solids give good value, though those solids lose tread fast on powered axles and struggle in wet climates.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L56322-L56358】

#### Community & Logistics Notes
- Import math still favors regional resellers: direct-from-China price lists are real, but EU buyers report ~$40 shipping plus ~€20 customs per motor and multi-week waits, making Kroxne/VTA stock appealing despite markups; two 1200 W hubs shipped privately can run $300–350 in freight alone.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L52331-L52347】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L52481-L52505】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L52598-L52624】
- Mid-February chatter flagged national safety recalls and ongoing stem-mod planning: riders measured the Xiaomi steering tube at roughly 22 mm for bar swaps and shared UK press about fire-prone scooters alongside the need for proper protective gear at 50+ km/h speeds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L56944-L56999】

### Lines 57001–62000

#### Firmware, Debugging & Tools
- XiaoGen migrations for 1S and Essential scooters demand flashing the provided “migrate” bundle before custom firmware, keeping the stock BLE and having an ST-Link ready in case the dashboard bricks—skipping steps left riders with blank speed and battery readouts.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L57963-L57986】
- Lite/Essential owners running 12 S externals avoid over-voltage faults by setting the custom firmware ceiling near 51 V, and Rita only exposes its configuration panel once the external pack sits a few tenths of a volt above the internal battery so the adapter can seize control.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L58644-L58649】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L60621-L60622】
- Mixed-pack users reported Rita v5 cutting power whenever a full 13 S internal outran a 12 S external; rolling back to v4 or running permanent BMS emulation resolved the jerks, and Denis shipped v6 shortly after to clear spurious red temperature icons on 12 S installs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L59217-L59240】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L61948-L61966】
- Custom pack counts still require firmware alignment: an 11 S build needs the regen limit dropped to ~47 V plus matching Rita cell settings, and the stock 10 S charger will top out around 41.7 V, leaving the extra cell undercharged without a dedicated 11 S supply.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L61197-L61218】
- Rita prioritizes whichever pack sits higher in voltage before blending both, so riders monitor state-of-charge via the app rather than assuming the external drains first.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L57085-L57091】

#### Batteries, Charging & Thermal Management
- Builders stacking 1 S boosters onto 12 S cores were reminded that each series add-on needs the same parallel count and separate charging, making a 14 S conversion cumbersome compared with jumping straight to a purpose-built 15–17 S system.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L57024-L57033】
- Hitting 70–80 km/h realistically demands at least 17 S, upgraded controllers, full suspension, and large 6–10 P packs that can cost €500–700 in cells alone—well beyond what the stock frame can house without external bags.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L58013-L58022】
- Cell sourcing stayed tight: Samsung 50E vs. 35E debates highlighted the 50E’s lower voltage sag but 30 A ceiling on a 3 P pack, global shortages made either hard to find, and even official Liitokala packs arrived with unknown “BICO” cells that veterans refused to trust for high-current builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L57460-L57483】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L57515-L57531】
- Cheap AliExpress batteries continued to disappoint: a 48 V Liitokala pack overheated and shut itself off within weeks, while salvaged laptop cells demand capacity binning, self-discharge checks, and balanced grouping (e.g., via Repackr) before re-use.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L59217-L59218】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L61173-L61190】
- LiPo bricks work with Rita but need a protective BMS and strict current limiting because the adapter’s fuse is 40 A and pouch packs vent violently when abused; Denis reiterates that reputable 18650s fail more gracefully.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L60565-L60570】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L61162-L61167】
- Range reports illustrate the payoff of quality packs: one 13 S 9 P internal build returned 35 km with over half the battery remaining, while a Rita + Aerdu 10 S 14 Ah external enabled 82 km of mixed riding by daisy-chaining spare externals.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L58541-L58544】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L60553-L60553】
- Large-format projects underline design tradeoffs—12 S 9 P 21700 packs sag like smaller 13 S 3 P arrays, Wildman 3 L bags can host dense sideways PCB layouts, and essentials upgraded for 30 km/h at 100 kg realistically see only 8–10 km of usable range.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L59890-L59924】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L61982-L61989】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L58445-L58455】

#### Motors, Controllers & Performance
- Tudor’s reinforced controllers remain capped around 13 S—experimenters pushing 17–19 S on earlier revisions were warned that 27 A at 17 S already means 1.3 kW and risks melting MOSFETs, so future 15–20 S hardware is being purpose-built instead.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L57129-L57161】
- Voltage without current headroom hits diminishing returns: 14 S setups on Monorim 500 W hubs plateau near 55 km/h until riders trade peak amps for lower voltage sag, and stock 12 S conversions hover around 44 km/h while 13 S packs drive 45–50 km/h at the cost of overheating 350 W motors—switching to a 500 W hub keeps controller temps in the low 40s even at 40 A.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L58179-L58179】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L59499-L59500】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L59573-L59595】
- Running high torque for long climbs can literally shake magnets loose—one 27 A Pro 2 motor howled after 45 minutes of hill work and likely lost efficiency permanently, reinforcing the need for active cooling or beefier hubs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L60012-L60018】
- Exotic mods like 13 S star/delta switching show 74 km/h freewheel speeds but also highlight how far beyond Xiaomi’s safe design envelope these experiments land.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L59957-L59967】
- Rita-based AWD projects essentially double everything—two ESCs, BLEs, motors, and matched batteries—to avoid voltage drop, while even single-motor riders chase smoother launches by enforcing a 3 km/h rolling start so the hub doesn’t chatter at zero RPM.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L60832-L60846】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L60981-L60992】
- Builders keep reiterating that Monorim’s 500 W hub is rated at 48 V—on a 10 S pack it behaves like a 375 W motor—so pairing it with 13 S packs and reinforcing controllers (caps, MOSFETs, traces) is essential.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L58935-L58974】

#### Tires, Suspension & Handling
- Switching to 10 × 3 inch rubber is transformative but requires suspension or fork fabrication; even with dual shocks, solid 10 × 2.5 tires transmitted every vibration and sent riders back to air setups like CST 3" casings.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L57103-L57113】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L57061-L57070】
- Monorim’s 500 W wheel ships with a solid tire and no valve hole—adding tubes means careful drilling and still leaves uncertainty about how the side covers clamp the bead, so some riders hold out for purpose-built tubed hubs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L57484-L57494】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L60839-L60849】
- Stem play fixes start with loosening the Monorim’s side bolts, tightening the central hinge screw just enough to kill wobble, then re-locking the pinch bolts—over-clamping snaps the bolt and causes crashes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L58916-L58933】
- Monorim handlebar adapters raise the folded deck slightly, so riders rotate or shim the bell hook to latch the rear fender again.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L61147-L61159】
- Tire reliability keeps improving with good practices: 10" Xuancheng tires plus 4.0–4.2 bar pressures dramatically cut flats, talcum powder prevents tubes from sticking and chafing, and slime or careful lever work avoids tube pinch when swapping rubber.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L61903-L61934】

#### Community, Logistics & Safety Notes
- Denis’ UK customers still face paused kit shipments amid EU paperwork, and global cell shortages left both NKON and UK warehouses dry even as Tudor quoted bespoke 48 V/25 Ah builds for upcoming weeks.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L57020-L57022】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L57515-L57518】
- Bag mounting hacks favor mechanical solutions: triangle frame bags bolted on with U-bolts and internal wooden/metal plates hold massive battery packs steadier than 3D-printed brackets.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L59904-L59924】
- Riders acknowledge the risks of chasing 50–70 km/h on Xiaomi frames—small tires, weak brakes, and lightweight chassis leave zero margin when potholes or wind gusts strike, reinforcing the need for protective gear and realistic speed goals.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L58003-L58023】

### Lines 62001–67000

#### Firmware, Debugging & Tools
- Pack builders keep cell groups balanced by matching internal resistance with tools like RePackr and double-checking charger calibration when readings disagree during binning.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L62038-L62055】
- A controller that powers on with a solid red LED and locked wheel almost always has shorted MOSFETs; replacing the transistors is the cure rather than chasing wiring faults.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L62055-L62056】
- Avoid bypassing the scooter BMS: Denis reiterated that direct-pack hookups to the control board skip safety checks and that his commercial PCB already exposes everything needed to build a compliant harness.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L62062-L62065】
- Rita firmware updates require babysitting—toggle the headlight every minute or two to defeat the scooter’s auto-shutdown, leave the scooter in dash “update mode,” and expect the progress bar to sit for several minutes before completing.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L62077-L62115】
- Riders favor Rita v6 for clearing spurious temperature warnings while retaining v4’s protections; v5 remains problematic on dual 13 S packs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L62096-L62104】
- The M365 Dash 2.0 must enter its Wi-Fi update screen for third-party apps to connect, and routers remembered from old firmware pushes can hijack the link mid-update until removed.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L62105-L62113】
- XiaoGen remains compatible with standard M365 scooters so long as riders flash the BLE 090 build before installing custom firmware.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L62403-L62408】
- Power-control throttle modes map lever position to current instead of speed; “flat” delivers linear torque while “quadratic” eases into acceleration before ramping hard near full travel.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L62503-L62512】
- Rita needs to be configured explicitly for dual 12 S packs to retain dashboard voltage and speed data—firmware patches that disable BMS checks remove that insight entirely.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L62733-L62741】
- Early reports that electronic braking vanishes above 10 S stemmed from misconfiguration; Denis confirmed that 12 S recuperation works once the external-pack cell count is set correctly in Rita’s app.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L62762-L62765】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L63260-L63264】
- Rita emulates the dash’s power telemetry, so the M365 2.0 display’s watt readout stays at zero regardless of the values programmed on the screen itself.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L62494-L62498】

#### Batteries, Charging & BMS
- 12 S builds chasing 30 A should respect stock Pro 2 controllers’ limits—veterans keep battery current near 27 A unless the board has been fully reinforced.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L62744-L62747】
- Cold weather slashes range by roughly half on 10 S 3 P packs at 4 °C, even though torque feels similar; high-capacity externals shoulder the load better but drain quickly when hammered in the cold.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L62410-L62428】
- Builders mixing 14 S4 P and 14 S3 P Rita packs report comparable voltage curves, confirming the adapter’s state-of-charge estimate remains reliable with parallel externals of similar size.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L62326-L62338】
- Wary of inconsistent balancing, riders replacing flaky AliExpress smart BMS boards now favor Daly units and adjust per-group internal-resistance entries only after confirming wiring and cycling the pack.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L63321-L63333】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L63380-L63409】
- Rita expects common-port externals terminated in XT30 connectors; specifying that detail when ordering from Denis or Krakow ensures plug-and-play compatibility.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L63410-L63424】
- Denis measured that a Pro deck fits 12 S4 P (48 cells) comfortably, can be stretched to 13 S4 P with tight tolerances, and gains room for 17 extra 21700 cells when a 2 cm spacer is added—enough for 13 S5 P energy that rivals a 33 Ah 10 S pack.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L63280-L63297】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L63300-L63304】
- Suspicious “48 V 99,999 mAh” externals from AliExpress remain fire hazards; Denis can’t warranty adapters fed by such packs, and veterans note that reputable builders barely squeeze 15–20 Ah into the same footprint.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L63479-L63505】

#### Motors, Controllers & Performance
- The stock 300 W Pro hub overheats within minutes when pushed past 1 kW, whereas Monorim’s 500 W motor tolerates 2 kW bursts significantly better under wind loads.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L62123-L62127】
- Dual 13 S setups still see top speed plateau near 40–42 km/h despite higher voltage because the controller enforces an internal limit.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L62132-L62133】
- 350 W hubs on 12 S deliver about 47 km/h on level ground at ~28 A, while 14 S builds with 75 kg riders record 49–52 km/h GPS speeds—reinforcing the need for cooling and upgraded brakes at higher voltage.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L62372-L62388】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L62437-L62448】
- VTA 14 S controllers tolerate roughly 32 A of drive current, but riders cap regenerative braking near 20 A to avoid frying the VBEC and MOSFETs—braking on 14 S feels stronger than equivalent 30 A settings on 12 S.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L62339-L62355】
- Thermal management tweaks such as replacing the controller’s yellow tape with 1 mm non-conductive pads and reinstalling paste between the housing and deck help sustain 22–24 A settings on Xiaomi Essential scooters without overheating.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L63044-L63060】
- Reinforced controllers from VTA and Paolo_VLC remain the go-to option in Europe for riders stepping beyond stock current limits.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L63424-L63429】

#### Tires, Brakes & Handling
- X-Tech calipers expose the weakness of budget rotors—if the disc warps after a ride, upgrade to bike-shop rotors rather than blaming the caliper.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L62767-L62775】
- Solid stem connections rely on well-seated phase connectors: riders solder the flat side of each lug to the controller pins to stop heat build-up that melts plastic housings.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L62144-L62157】
- Mixing tire sizes (10" front, 8.5" rear) still yields 48–50 km/h GPS speeds when pack voltage stays high, but keep an eye on hall sensors and brake maintenance to prevent repeated ESC failures.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L62422-L62458】

#### Security, Accessories & Rider Projects
- Heavy chain-and-lock combinations such as Abus Granit remain the community’s benchmark—even “unpickable” locks can be cut, so riders double up chains or keep scooters in sight despite the weight penalty.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L63431-L63448】
- Custom 3D-printed mounts and Wildman cases continue evolving; builders often withhold STL files when the parts fund their small businesses.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L62486-L62499】

#### Logistics & Market Conditions
- Rita production hit delays through mid-March 2021 thanks to semiconductor shortages, while global 18650 scarcity and Brexit paperwork kept UK-bound battery shipments stalled or returned to sender.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L63623-L63653】
- Pandemic bottlenecks continue to inflate lead times, though community members note that non-battery parcels still reach Canada faster than parts of the EU.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L63594-L63599】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L63632-L63652】

### Lines 67001–72000

#### Pack Fabrication & Battery Building
- DIY spot-welder builds leaned on copper zirconium (CuCrZr) electrodes and K-weld tooling; riders found K-weld tips superior for DC work, Chinese pens better on AC, and typically pulse 0.15 mm nickel at roughly 15–20 J while powering the welder from a 3 s 60 p LiPo block when capacitor banks are unavailable.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L67012-L67103】
- Community reminders stressed verifying solder heat management: keep board supports steady, avoid pre-heating entire PCBs, and rely on proper clamps plus controlled iron temperature to prevent warped controller traces during reinforcement jobs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L67253-L67267】
- Buyers trading large-format packs shared reference dimensions and budgets—e.g., a 15 S 5 P Samsung 30Q brick for €400 measuring roughly 37.5 × 9 × 7.2 cm—underscoring enclosure constraints once packs exceed Xiaomi’s stock footprint.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L67514-L67520】

#### Rita Roadmap, Configuration & Power Handling
- Denis confirmed the next Rita generation adds true current measurement, targets a 22 March 2021 release after additional testing, and will support Ninebot Max (G30) connectors; early adopters will trial units while he clears ≈80 remaining first-gen boards.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L67107-L67131】
- Inventory updates noted Rita was sold out until 22 March, and installers reported that Essential/1S frames pack the downtube with foam, so fishing the external battery lead takes patience compared with Pro/Pro2 layouts.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L67698-L67704】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L67989-L67989】
- High-voltage experiments require hardware changes: Rita’s default fuse covers ~12 S; cutting the 0.5 cm jumper near the LED lifts the emergency threshold from 57 V to about 67 V for 15 S packs, but only when the controller is reinforced for the voltage and the firmware ceiling is raised accordingly.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L67314-L67320】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L70602-L70604】
- Rita halts charge current once the internal pack is full, which can soften electronic braking on a topped-off battery; riders disable or limit regen accordingly when the pack hits its ceiling.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L68189-L68196】
- Rita Max/delta-mod users reported dramatically smoother current delivery on the G30 platform and teased an 80 A continuous-capable variant aimed at AWD projects, pending firmware refinements and power-saving tweaks.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L71140-L71157】
- Charging faults were often traced to adapters: a miswired XT60-to-XT30 pigtail prevented one scooter from charging through Rita until the connector issue was fixed.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L71325-L71375】
- Riders confirmed Rita still lets parallel packs at different voltages connect and hot-swap, provided each battery stays within its safe voltage window.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L71612-L71621】
- Essential/1S owners should configure Rita for the smaller 5200 mAh 10 S internal pack rather than Pro-class values; later shipments of “classic” scooters already include 1S hardware and dual fuses even when listings say M365.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L67710-L67713】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L71389-L71436】

#### Firmware & Recovery Practices
- ST-Link v2 dongles remained cheap insurance—roughly €4 in Poland and about €10 delivered elsewhere—and can be soldered directly if header pins are unavailable, making controller unbricks far faster after failed BLE flashes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L67134-L67152】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L67449-L67452】
- Francois published a tested XiaoGen migration workflow for Pro 2/1S/Essential scooters: build the firmware, flash the provided migrate package with m365DownG XG Mod, then load the custom zip—without downgrading the newer BLE revisions that ship on 2020+ dashboards.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L67326-L67331】
- Veterans warned that flashing legacy BLE images on “new series” dashboards hard-bricks them; stick to stock BLE 131/132 and only alter DRV or power settings, falling back to m365 Dashboard or XiaoFlasher for configuration.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L67741-L67758】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L71572-L71580】
- Flux selection matters when reinforcing harnesses: water-soluble flux keeps wire soldering clean, while gray flux handles brake cables; pre-tinning leads makes ST-Link hookups and harness repairs easier.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L67573-L67576】

#### Maintenance, Thermal & Hardware Lessons
- Opening Pro hubs without cosmetic damage works best with two opposing flat-blade screwdrivers tapped under the side plate; hall-sensor repairs can follow once the cover is free.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L67163-L67166】
- Bearing upgrades needn’t be premium: ZVL units hold up well if riders keep dust and moisture at bay, whereas solid tires, rain use, and outdoor storage accelerate wear regardless of brand; CST V3 tires last but are difficult to mount, and 10" rubber costs some launch torque on stock tunes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L67179-L67209】
- Stock 350 W hubs lack gaskets; tightening cover screws is usually enough to deter water ingress, though riders experimenting with 12 S builds still add silicone if heat levels stay reasonable.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L67275-L67280】
- Pro 2 v3.0 controllers struggle with sustained 12 S at 40 A—hills quickly cook phases and MOSFETs—so riders either cap current near 30 A or step up to reinforced/VTA boards before pushing voltage and amperage together.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L67456-L67469】
- Adding large capacitor banks across phase leads can smooth acceleration but risks over-voltage on regen; builders place capacitors before the ESC and size them carefully to avoid explosive braking spikes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L67488-L67512】
- Thermal management tips included swapping Xiaomi’s Kapton pads for high-conductivity (≈11 W/m·K) non-conductive silicone sheets, sanding mating surfaces smooth, continuity-testing paste to confirm it stays non-conductive, and keeping spare silicone tape on hand to replace brittle stock insulators.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L67997-L68148】
- Keeping 8.5" tires around 3.5 bar helped one rider maintain 37 km/h climbs compared with a stock scooter struggling at 20 km/h, highlighting how pressure management influences speed and efficiency.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L68208-L68209】
- Regen charging and hill control planning for G30 builds suggested LG M36 21700 packs tolerate about 1.2 A regenerative bursts for a few seconds, similar to Samsung 35E guidance, when designing 9–10 P internal packs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L71675-L71684】
- Pushing M365-class frames beyond 12 S demands controller component swaps, not just trace reinforcement; veterans advised sourcing proper high-voltage boards and quality cells such as Samsung 35E when aiming for 14–15 S builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L71992-L71999】

#### Logistics, Sourcing & Market Notes
- Pandemic-era shipping remained shaky: one Amazon M365 vanished in UPS limbo for a week, prompting riders to demand lithium handling paperwork and follow the carrier’s battery manual; others reported UPS blocking UK/EU lithium lanes unless documentation was perfect.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L67784-L67787】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L68090-L68096】
- UK riders struggling to import packs leaned on VTA’s London shop for 13 S batteries and reinforced controllers, sidestepping Brexit restrictions until Denis can resume direct battery exports.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L68107-L68113】
- Ninebot upgrade plans called for grinding M365 rims or widening forks to fit 10×3.5" tires, and buyers of 10" kits like Kroxne’s were reminded to secure the countersunk fender bolt and spacer hardware the bundle omits.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L67786-L67796】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L71245-L71247】
- Semiconductor shortages continued to slow Rita production through late March 2021, keeping adapters and smart packs in short supply even as small parcels still moved around Europe and Canada relatively quickly.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L70857-L70860】
- Retailers increasingly ship the Mi 1S instead of the classic M365 despite old product listings; customers should inspect dashboards, fuse counts, and pack telemetry (e.g., via M365 Tools) to confirm the actual hardware before flashing firmware or ordering accessories.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L71389-L71436】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L71412-L71435】

#### Performance Snapshots
- A 13 S 3 P 350 W setup reported 50 km/h speeds, illustrating the pace gains possible once voltage climbs—provided braking and thermal capacity keep up.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L71385-L71386】
- Mixed-wheel builds leaned on 3.5 mm positive and 1.5 mm negative bullet connectors to carry higher phase currents without overheating during aggressive launches.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L71256-L71266】

### Lines 72001–77000

#### Rita Configuration & Firmware Behavior
- Riders who saw "yoyo" surging around 25–30 % state of charge traced it to the external pack tripping its BMS; the fix was lowering Rita’s max current to roughly 25 A, confirming the 10 S cell count, and leaning on XiaoGen firmware when stock settings couldn’t stabilize the combo.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L72014-L72028】
- The group reiterated that the “Remove power limit” checkbox simply disables current derating—anyone using it should halve their configured amps, because Rita’s 30 A design ceiling left one rider with a charred adapter after 39 A spikes and another with a burnt 48 V setup at 35 A on a long hill.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L72127-L72155】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L72653-L72702】
- Denis reminded owners that the temperature icon Rita shows after charging is a deliberate regen lockout; energy recovery resumes after a short ride, and charging both packs from the scooter port is safe only when the external BMS is a common-port design.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L72182-L72194】
- New 1S/Pro 2 riders were steered toward Denis’ range+boost pack, controller reinforcement, and a XiaoGen tune, with `pro2.cfw.sh` recommended for quick Pro 2 firmware tweaks when XiaoFlasher feels limited.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L72202-L72210】
- High-voltage experiments (14 S/16 S) stayed on Rita only with heavily reinforced controllers—builders running 14 S at 25–30 A quoted ~32 mph on dual 300 W hubs, while future 16 S plans targeted 60 A once sturdier hardware and software safeguards land.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L73102-L73180】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L73114-L73124】

#### External Batteries & Charging Practices
- Custom packs still need their own BMS: veterans warned that running externals bare shortens cell life, and even dual 48 V packs on Rita must use common-port boards with the scooter’s charge port paralleled correctly if owners want to refill both packs together.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L72825-L72827】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L76548-L76559】
- Faulty charge jacks and adapters caused most “won’t charge” complaints—one rider ultimately found a bad connector in his custom harness, while another discovered a replacement charge port shipped with reversed polarity that only Rita exposed; swapping to a genuine Xiaomi jack restored normal operation.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L72594-L72638】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L73899-L73952】
- Builders continue to 3D print or laser-cut angled spacers and PETG “cages” so 10 S–13 S bricks breathe inside 2 L Wildman bags; plastic separators were still encouraged to prevent hot spots even when space is tight.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L72706-L72727】
- Debate over busbar routing on 13 S stacks ended with a reminder that equal-length nickel alone doesn’t balance groups—proper series links, solid welds, and Micah Toll’s reference diagrams remain the way to distribute current evenly.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L72770-L72791】

#### Controllers, Motors & Performance
- Community tweaks kept highlighting thermal discipline: reinforcing leads, cleaning flux, and replacing kapton with silicone pads stopped error 28 shorts after soldering jobs, while moving the v1.4 temperature sensor between MOSFETs and adding extra rubber strips improved contact pressure.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L72730-L72749】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L72830-L72838】
- Clone scooter shells often need longer controller screws and washers; one rider solved intermittent error 28 simply by swapping 10 mm fasteners for 16 mm hardware so the board clamped correctly.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L72852-L72864】
- The team confirmed that Monorim’s 500 W solid tire collapses under hard launches—owners either drill the rim to fit pneumatic tires or stick with genuine Xuancheng rubber—and some are reselling the motor/controller combo after just a few dozen miles.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L72498-L72521】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L76553-L76566】
- Ninebot Max (G30) Gen 2 hubs proved potent when overvolted: a remote VESC test hit 5 kW and 125 km/h unloaded on 16 S, but the crew stressed that the casing doesn’t bolt into Xiaomi frames without Monorim brackets or welding, and Gen 1 units trade speed for torque.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L73885-L73933】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L73970-L73972】

#### Tires, Suspension & Braking
- Steering dampers and sturdier mudguard mounts are keeping high-speed builds controllable on rough pavement; the 3D-printed damper brackets shared in chat tame bar shake at ~30 km/h and above, while hand-fabricated fenders and supports handle jumps and heavy spray better than stock plastic.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L72080-L72088】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L74111-L74154】
- CST 10×2.5″ tires remain the go-to 10" pneumatic swap for Pro/1S scooters, but members reminded newcomers that cloning Monorim suspension geometry or mixing in Sharkset hardware demands careful bolt sizing and occasional metalwork to keep travel smooth.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L72594-L72617】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L74100-L74143】
- Brake chatter after cable swaps usually traces back to pinched lines under the controller or damaged housings; using better calipers (TRP Spyke/NUTT), keeping the barrel adjuster lubricated, and checking spring tension solved most squeal complaints.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L73147-L73158】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L76912-L76916】

#### Tools & Maintenance Tips
- Seal opened hub motors with a thin bead of automotive silicone and upgrade to SKF 6001-2RSH bearings (or similar sealed units) if you ride in wet climates; heavy riders pointed out the stock bearings ship nearly dry and wear quickly.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L72300-L72337】
- Stuck wheel bearings come out easiest with the hub clamped upside-down in a vise, a shot of penetrating oil, and a long punch rotated around the race; reinstall the new units with steady pressure instead of hammering the stator itself.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L72507-L72521】
- When dashboard screws strip, riders hammer in an oversized Torx, use extractor bits in reverse, or heat the head—bike shops often refuse the job, so investing in these tools saves time and avoids damaged plastics.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L76925-L76938】

#### Logistics & Marketplace Notes
- Denis’ March 2021 Rita batch was capped by the global chip crunch: only 15 units were slated for release the following Monday, with the next run penciled in for 5 April, so customers were urged to order early and expect delays.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L73383-L73405】
- Battery and semiconductor shortages are industry-wide—members blamed pandemic demand spikes and noted that even big factories are running flat out, so expect lingering supply issues for cells, controllers, and adapters.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L76816-L76820】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L73413-L73419】
- Riders flagged Spanish reseller Iscooting for drop-shipping Chinese stock despite claiming local inventory, advising others to stick with in-stock suppliers like VTA/Kroxne or pursue PayPal refunds rather than wait months for suspended shipments.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L76834-L76891】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L76872-L76877】

### Lines 77001–82000

#### Tire & Tube Service Tips
- Removing the brake disc before tackling a punctured inner tube prevents damage, and dusting tubes plus using spoons or soft plastic levers with rounded edges keeps 8.5″/10″ tires (especially CST V3 fronts) from scratching the rim or slicing replacements during reinstallation.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L77016-L77050】

#### Controller & Thermal Management
- Replacing the stock yellow tape with a 9×2 cm, 1 mm-thick non-conductive thermal pad, stacking another 1–2 mm pad above the rubber block to preload the MOSFETs, adding thermal paste under the housing, seating the brake cable correctly, and tightening screws gradually keeps replacement controllers cool; also make sure the temperature probe sits between MOSFETs instead of under one to avoid phantom overheat alarms.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L77069-L77083】

#### Firmware, Rita & Charging Behavior
- Rita alters charge-mode signaling: the tail light may stop flashing during charging, so verify progress with tools such as M365 when available or watch pack voltage rise if you lack Android support.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L78024-L78038】
- Pro 2/1S/Essential owners migrating to XiaoGen should retain their original BLE, restore DRV155 stock firmware, flash the `XioGen2-0-5_Migrate.zip` bridge with the m365DownG XG Mod 21 app, then load their custom build; future updates repeat the same steps, and rollbacks use standard m365DownG/XiaoFlasher tools.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L78196-L78201】
- Set “Direct power control” to Always On and rely on power-based limits when chasing top speed; leaving speed control active caps Pro/1S builds around the entered 45 km/h even when the hardware can go faster.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L78062-L78071】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L78132-L78136】
- Cut Rita’s exposed high-voltage jumper whenever pack voltage exceeds ~51 V—riders running 13 S at 54.8 V without clipping it were warned they were simply “lucky” nothing had failed yet.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L78615-L78640】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L78690-L78691】

#### Firmware & Speed Troubleshooting
- A fully charged 12 S conversion (≈50.4 V external with ~41 V internal) should spin near 40 km/h even on the 250 W 1S motor; if you only see 32–33 km/h, your custom firmware is still limiting output and needs rework or a XiaoGen tune.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L77149-L77234】
- Keep CFW battery current near 24 A on stock traces (27–28 A only after reinforcing the controller), otherwise “1200 W” presets risk overheating or cooking adapters.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L77272-L77279】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L77852-L77854】

#### External Batteries & BMS Practices
- Y-cabling two externals into Rita is acceptable only when both packs share the same nominal voltage; mixing 36 V and 48 V bricks on a Y harness was discouraged outright.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L77355-L77355】
- Daly common-port BMS boards remain the go-to for external builds—including Rita boosters and standalone 10 S packs—because they simplify wiring and support safe simultaneous charge/discharge.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L78453-L78475】
- When a pack stops accepting charge yet still rides, inspect the BMS LED first—steady red or disconnected sense leads are common culprits long before the charger is at fault.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L78004-L78009】
- Inspect external-pack welds for even penetration on both sides; riders favor six-spot weld patterns to keep modules from shaking loose mid-ride.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L78255-L78262】
- Keep parallel groups within ~0.03 V when assembling packs—larger spreads shorten lifespan even though a BMS can rebalance over time—so builders pre-balance cells and recheck after several cycles.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L78454-L78512】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L79191-L79192】
- Fitting 16–20 S packs under Xiaomi decks demands extensions: even 16S6P (96 cells) hangs just a few centimetres off the road, and 20 S bricks won’t fit without raising the deck significantly.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L78365-L78390】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L79048-L79050】

#### Motors, Performance & Cooling
- Motor Kv dictates trade-offs: the 250 W stator keeps torque with less heat but limits speed, the 300 W Pro motor balances torque and pace, and the 350 W option overvolts well yet needs far more amps (and cooling) to match hill-climb torque—reinforced 13 S/10″ builds can touch 60–70 km/h downhill when everything holds together.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L77545-L77574】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L78164-L78169】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L78701-L78721】
- Nameplate power assumes nominal voltage: a “1000 W 48 V” hub draws roughly 1.75 kW on 84 V 20 S packs, so controllers and MOSFETs must be spec’d accordingly (IRFB4110-class or VESC hardware) before pushing those builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L77692-L77724】
- Community testing dismissed 3D-printed “motor heat sinks” as aesthetic; real gains come from ferrofluid fills that improve stator-to-shell conduction and by backing off the last 1–2 km/h to curb heat soak.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L77483-L77553】
- Trampa VESC upgrades delivered ~78 km/h bursts on 12 S ebike builds but demanded supplemental cooling, torque arms, and motorcycle-grade protection before exploring 70–80 A targets.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L78298-L78307】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L78841-L78867】

#### Suspension & Brake Hardware
- Monorim’s bolt-on front caliper bracket relies on two small screws; members felt it’s unsafe for 120 mm discs without reinforcement or adhesive, noting Sharkset alternatives may package sturdier hardware and that Monorim bearings need frequent greasing to survive more than ~1,000 km.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L78553-L78568】

#### Troubleshooting & Maintenance
- Stick with the correct F43 hall sensors on M365 hubs—mixing in F41 parts cleared error codes but left the motor unable to spin or report speed.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L77892-L77904】
- Error 15 (“phase C current abnormal”) usually points to loose phase plugs; power-cycle with brakes held, reseat connectors, and confirm the wheel spins freely before retrying.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L78414-L78431】
- Storing externals in LiPo bags adds both fire protection and strain relief for XT30 connectors during transport.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L77920-L77925】
- JST PAP-03V-S housings and mates match the 1.5 mm-pitch connectors builders need when wiring BMS or Rita hot-swap harnesses.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L79050-L79059】

#### Sourcing & Marketplace Notes (Update)
- European riders continue sourcing genuine 500 W hubs through VTA or Kroxne to avoid VAT surprises, while eBay finds still require extra scrutiny.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L77887-L77891】
- A higher-current “Rita Max” variant (double-current adapters) is in tester hands only—Denis hasn’t opened sales beyond those evaluation units yet.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L78685-L78690】

### Lines 82001–87000

#### Scooter Selection & Weatherproofing
- UK commuters weighing Pure Air versus Xiaomi builds were steered back to the Pro/Pro 2 or G30 platforms plus an external pack; riders highlighted that a hydrogel phone film over the dashboard keeps the button responsive while sealing it, and engine gasket sealant around the deck seams and wire grommets finishes a £1–2 waterproofing job.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L82033-L82071】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L82140-L82166】
- Protective gear came up alongside 40 km/h targets: heavy jackets plus DOT/ECE-certified motorcycle lids were urged over bicycle helmets, with €80–€150 sales cited as realistic entry points for proper crash protection.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L82308-L82337】

#### Controller & Electrical Upgrades
- Paolo’s 13 S-ready ESC v1.4 mod swaps two SMD resistors, changes a capacitor, drops the U4 switching frequency to 400 kHz, raises its output to 16.6 V, and adds 3× 470 µF 63 V Nichicon PW capacitors plus a 2 200 µF C0 to reach 3 610 µF of bulk capacitance, allowing 13 S packs without cutting traces or cooking U4.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L82177-L82194】
- Riders reminded one another that 13 S setups demand reinforced controllers: stock pads should be replaced with 1–1.5 mm non-conductive thermal pads and paste under the baseplate, and 2.1 boards really need upgrading before running sustained 28–30 A currents or 14 S builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L82560-L82566】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L85711-L85727】
- Xiaomi charge ports can be repurposed for simultaneous internal/external charging by tying the thin charge leads into the Y-harness—so long as both packs use common-port BMS hardware and batteries are disconnected while soldering to avoid shorts.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L84160-L84188】

#### Battery Building & BMS Practices
- A late-night pack fire underscored workshop discipline: stray solder balls or dropped nickel strips can short mixed Chinese 18650s instantly, so builders stressed clean benches, quick removal of accidental bridges, sand buckets/extinguishers nearby, and skepticism toward mystery-brand cells.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L83011-L83076】
- Community consensus pegged 12 S 3 P auxiliaries as “really small” for high-power tunes and reiterated that 13 S5 P+ internals or 13 S6 P conversions hold speed late into the discharge, whereas Essential-class BMS boards bottleneck output near 400 W unless they’re upgraded.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L82553-L82566】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L84690-L84695】
- For 36 V externals on stock controllers, Francois recalculated that XiaoGen’s 30 A limits translate to roughly 20 A at the battery, making dual 20 A common-port BMS units sufficient for ~900 W draw while keeping cells balanced; heavier packs need matching cell groups to prevent single-group sag complaints.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L84260-L84289】

#### Motors, Tires & Hardware
- Ninebot G30 hub swaps remain coveted for their copper fill and 125 km/h test pedigree, but fitting one into an M365 demands mixing two Monorim kits, machining spacers, lengthening motor leads, and slightly enlarging the controller plug before it seats reliably.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L82225-L82255】
- Monorim quietly revised its front mast: the new grey tube arrives double-welded with cleaner internals, fixing the early run that cracked after ~100 km, though installers still shave a notch in the controller box to route wiring cleanly.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L85003-L85028】
- Members experimenting with 10×2.5″ tire installs on rear motors traded techniques for truing the rim—spinning it with another scooter or a rubber eraser wheel—to avoid the wobble induced by uneven material removal.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L86104-L86133】

#### Security & Tracking
- Theft deterrence revolved around layered defenses: hide GPS units on the main harness, pair Rita-powered builds with motion alarms in the battery bag, keep hardened chains handy, and consider remote immobilisers that freeze the front wheel until a key fob wakes the scooter—all while recognizing that determined thieves may still haul a 20 kg rig away.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L82504-L82551】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L82699-L82735】

#### Rita Usage & Wiring Notes
- Denis and the crew walked newcomers through Rita basics: the adapter still expects XT30 connectors, supports removing the internal pack if you rewire the tail-light’s green data lead to any negative source, and remains the only plug-and-play way to parallel mixed-voltage batteries when paired with correctly spec’d packs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L84863-L84899】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L84937-L84946】
- Riders awaiting a Max-compatible Rita noted there’s no alternative yet; firmware “charge mode” bypasses only helps when both batteries share the same voltage, whereas Rita actively arbitrates unequal pack voltages and prevents mid-ride shutdowns.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L84860-L84883】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L84885-L84899】

#### Troubleshooting & Monitoring
- BLE add-ons can supply real motor core temperatures by piggybacking on the hall sensor’s 5 V line, giving earlier warnings than shell readings and helping keep magnets below the ~80 °C demagnetization threshold reported by riders pushing 2 kW tunes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L85124-L85170】
- Builders reminded each other to replace flimsy aftermarket fasteners—rear suspension bolts or brake adapters sourced from budget kits often shear—and to source reputable components (e.g., Mouser for IRFB4110 MOSFETs and 100 V capacitors) instead of gambling on AliExpress “reinforced” boards.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L82208-L82218】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L86173-L86179】

### Lines 87001–92000

#### Controller Repair & Thermal Management
- Clean up burnt flux and stray solder after controller repairs—the group keeps a metal scraper and isopropyl alcohol on hand to remove residue so boards don’t short or corrode after heavy rework.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L87012-L87024】
- High-current builds rely on proper wiring rather than blobs of solder: riders pair their anti-spark switches with solid wire bridges so electrons follow the copper, not excess solder, and e-board grade switches tolerate the amps scooter packs deliver.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L87162-L87174】
- Adding bulk capacitors to M365 controllers smooths launches—the extra µF makes acceleration more linear, pulls harder, and trims switching losses once the board is reinforced.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L87195-L87199】
- For sustained 2 kW pulls, builders now press MOSFETs directly against the scooter frame with paste or copper shims instead of adding fans, keeping controller temps below 40 °C even on reinforced setups.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L87366-L87381】

#### Firmware & Troubleshooting Updates
- Denis steered 1S owners toward the paid XiaoFlasher firmware builder, noted the ScooterHacking generator outage, and reminded them to swap BLE/DRV only to supported versions (e.g., BLE 129/132, DRV 155/218+) or fall back to ST-Link v2 when Bluetooth flashing fails.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L87243-L87313】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L87305-L87306】
- Flash the higher 51 V limit before wiring Rita, then try multiple flash attempts with other devices disabled if XiaoFlasher stalls—once successful, the scooter accepts the external pack without errors.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L87304-L87320】
- Rita’s “battery temp −10 °C” alert is simply a regen lockout on fully charged packs; a short wide-open run clears it, or riders can update to Rita v6 to relax the safeguard.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L88303-L88309】
- M365 Tools only exposes Rita telemetry while an external battery is active—the scooter’s native BMS retakes the data line when the adapter idles, so seeing only internal data is expected.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L89179-L89182】
- XiaoGen users looking for instant response stick with the “instant” throttle profile and modest 150–200 mA steps; cranking ramp rates higher just spikes controller heat without delivering perceptibly quicker launches.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L88314-L88315】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L89453-L89472】

#### Battery Building & Pack Handling
- G30 rental packs arrive potted in silicone, leaving their BMS buried; frustrated owners either break out the encapsulant or swap in a fresh board because the stock module can’t be reset or serviced.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L87214-L87233】
- When stripping aluminum-encased ebike batteries, the crew avoids grinders entirely—open the ends, score the silicone with a utility blade, brace the shell in a vise, then drive the cell block out with a wooden drift from the non-BMS side.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L88057-L88085】
- DIYers leaning on 0.1 mm × 8 mm nickel confirmed that double layers carry 20 A BMS loads safely, but they ditched low-temperature hot glue because it softens near cell operating temps and eventually crumbles; PVC wraps, honeycomb spacers, paper insulators, and patience while waiting for proper supplies were the preferred alternatives.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L88155-L88333】
- Builders pointed newcomers toward Micah Toll’s battery handbook as baseline reading before welding packs, stressing that a few euros on education beats rebuilding scorched cells later.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L88244-L88245】
- Stock Xiaomi M365 batteries generally ship with LG M26 or blue EVE 18650 cells, so anyone modeling pack performance in calculators should use those chemistries instead of assuming higher-spec MJ1 cells.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L88335-L88345】
- Tudor’s 48.84 km/h customer run paired three 10 S packs (OEM 12.8 Ah, a 10 Ah 21700 internal, and a 12.8 Ah external) with a 350 W motor and 10″ tires—parallel capacity kept voltage sag minimal, explaining the speed advantage over single 12 S setups that droop harder under load.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L88150-L88194】

#### Hardware Fitment & Accessories
- Denis shared the Ninebot G30 charge-port part numbers (WM20246-ND / WM19542-ND) for riders salvaging fleet batteries or replacing missing connectors on oddball BMS boards.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L88272-L88278】
- One late-April hack bent a 10 mm aluminum rod into a mudguard bracket that tucks under the rear axle nut and uses heat-shrink padding to stabilize 10″ conversions without the brittle stock washer stack.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L91065-L91070】
- Rear G30 mudguards measure roughly 11.5 cm across, giving enough coverage for 2.5″ tires; riders transplant them onto Konyk or other swingarms when they need wider spray protection than the stock M365 fender provides.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L91188-L91224】
- Shoulder-bag battery carriers even considered adding thin aluminum plates outside their fiberglass fire sleeves to deflect direct flames and spread weight across the pack so straps don’t pinch cells.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L88051-L88055】

#### Safety & Riding Practices
- Denis reiterated that scooter riders remain responsible for collisions in pedestrian zones—people on foot “are allowed to be stupid,” so keep speeds tame and yield even when the crowd steps unpredictably.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L87236-L87239】
- After a sidewalk crash video, veterans reminded newcomers that narrow tire e-brakes won’t stop fast enough; stick with disc-equipped scooters if you insist on riding near pedestrians.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L87346-L87347】
- The late-April speed debate ended with practical caps—around 45 km/h was deemed plenty for 8.5–10″ wheels, with several members emphasizing that chasing 60 km/h on tiny tires is “way too dangerous.”【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L88206-L88224】

#### High-Voltage Builds & VESC Plans
- Francois added a thermistor inside his hub, mapped out a 15 S 8 P Samsung 40T battery split between the deck and twin bags, and plans to rewire the motor in 8 AWG once a 160 A BMS arrives—he’s running a Spintend 75 V/200 A dual VESC that barely fits inside the Pro frame.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L91096-L91128】
- VESC control lets the crew draw custom throttle curves, adjust current ramping, and choose true power-based response instead of the speed algorithms baked into Xiaomi firmware.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L91138-L91140】

### Lines 92001–97000

#### Battery Pack Design & Diagnostics
- A mixed 10S + 3S experiment exposed how quickly LG MJ1 groups sag under high load—the crew advised expanding to at least 6 P, or swapping to Samsung 40T cells and spot-welding tabs instead of soldering so the pack can deliver the amps without tripping BMS protection.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L92003-L92046】
- Even when you add more parallel groups, the BMS rating remains the practical ceiling: riders noted that 80 A-capable cells still bottleneck at a 40 A BMS and will suffer major sag if firmware demands exceed that budget.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L93571-L93578】
- Professional builders compared Daly and ANT smart BMS boards, highlighting horror stories of poorly welded packs, stressing pre-balanced cells, and steering high-current customers toward ANT units while keeping Daly for budget builds that don’t need massive discharge currents.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L93231-L93318】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L93320-L93334】

#### Charging, BMS Recovery & Parallel Workflow
- When Rita drops BMS telemetry, the fix is to disconnect the adapter, restore stock wiring, flash the 12800 BMS image via ST-Link, recharge to 41–42 V, and only then reinstall the adapter and custom firmware.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L92623-L92630】
- Denis okayed hybrid 10S + 3S builds as long as each pack keeps its own charger: wire the combined 13S output into Rita’s XT30, leave Rita’s charge distribution leads unused, and charge all three packs separately to avoid over-volting the internal BMS.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L93231-L93263】
- Rita can pass trickle-charge current while you ride (e.g., from a 100 W solar panel) provided the scooter firmware ignores charge mode and the DC-DC source respects the converter’s 1.6–1.7 A input limit.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L93065-L93088】

#### Rita Safeguards & Regeneration Limits
- The adapter still expects parallel batteries—trying to stack a 3 S range extender in series through Rita simply doesn’t work and risks overcharging unless the extra segment carries its own charge lead and charger.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L92303-L92352】
- Builders reiterated that 13 S and above require clipping Rita’s pink jumper to give the module voltage headroom; running 54–57 V packs without that safety gap is just luck.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L92936-L92941】
- A shop report of a blown Rita and stock battery on an AWD scooter reignited the reminder to keep combined regenerative currents below the adapter’s ~30 A design limit and to avoid mixing 42 V internals with 13 S externals unless both controllers and regen settings are tuned conservatively.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L93808-L93849】

#### Controller & VESC Integration
- Spintend Ubox and other VESC adopters leaned on autotune for dual-motor builds, kept throttle and brake inputs at 3.3 V (5 V risks frying the ESC), and added wireless shunt wattmeters to log current draw during rides.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L92532-L92590】
- Monorim’s 500 W hub proved torque-hungry: it only shines above ~1.2 kW, benefits from VESC control, and still demands high-quality cells because 12S4P MJ1 packs sag like stock 10 S groups once currents exceed ~30 A.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L93020-L93060】

#### Tires, Handling & Maintenance
- Fitting 10×2.50″ tires on Xiaomi rims takes removing roughly 1.5 mm of material (a lathe makes quick work of it), switching to curved valves for Monorim motors, and running 60–65 psi (~4.2 bar) for 90 kg riders while treating wet or icy pavement with extreme caution.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L93600-L93647】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L93636-L93646】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L93717-L93725】
- Controller repair threads recommended desoldering braid or wire jumpers to rebuild burnt traces and placing balance leads in the center of each parallel group for even readings before investing in reinforced boards.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L93655-L93675】
- DIY turn-signal installs used cheap motorcycle fork brackets, but veterans warned that protruding hardware is easy to kick off, so plan mounts with durability in mind.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L93675-L93685】

#### Logistics & Sourcing Updates
- Denis still can’t ship lithium packs outside the EU—Chile-bound buyers were told to order Rita and the bag only, then source cells locally—while UK riders leaned on VTA and Scootermode during COVID shipping disruptions instead of gambling on AliExpress packs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L92935-L92960】
- Battery shoppers were urged to stick with known builders (Denis, VTA, Scootermode, Rumi) or build their own, since too-cheap listings usually hide recycled or sand-filled cells.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L92942-L92960】

### Lines 97001–102000

#### Motor Physics & Speed Limits
- Riders troubleshooting downhill braking on 12 S/13 S Monorim builds learned it’s classic back-EMF—the hub generates more voltage than the pack at high RPM, so the controller brakes to protect itself. Raising pack voltage shifts the speed ceiling, and high-acceptance cells (e.g., Samsung 40T in larger parallel groups) absorb those regen surges with less voltage spike.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L97029-L97064】

#### Wiring, Connectors & Harness Care
- XT30 plugs and 16 AWG leads are marginal once builds pull more than ~30 A—owners swapping to XT60 hardware with 12 AWG (or even 10 AWG on longer runs) reported cooler connectors and less voltage drop, while high-power experiments stacked extra parallels with 8 AWG feeders for 70–80 A targets.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L97273-L97274】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L98519-L98544】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L99249-L99305】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L99351-L99388】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L99995-L100001】
- JST PAP-03V-S housings remain the go-to when adapting BMS or dashboard harnesses; members hunting the OEM battery-to-controller plug confirmed the PAP-03 series matches the stock pitch and latch.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L100580-L100585】
- Spot-welding layered nickel demands multiple hits: Denis’ packs use three welds per tab, and builders crank the K-weld power accordingly so double-stacked strip doesn’t peel under stress.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L97149-L97167】

#### Battery Charging & Telemetry
- The factory Xiaomi charge port safely carries about 3 A; higher-current bricks heat the wiring unless you upgrade the connector and gauge, so YZPower 42 V 3 A units remain the practical ceiling for stock hardware.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L97910-L97915】
- Rita only exposes external-pack telemetry once voltages match—charge the add-on until it equals or slightly exceeds the internal pack, then the adapter shares current and the app surfaces the second battery.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L99969-L99982】
- Denis warned that KERS failures usually trace back to custom internals with common-port BMS boards that block regen current; when Rita sees nowhere to dump energy it disables recuperation to prevent over-voltage, so rewiring or swapping BMS hardware is the long-term fix.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L100009-L100014】
- Melted XT30 housings tend to follow cracked battery tabs and undersized wire—after repairs, owners upgraded to XT60 with heavier leads and used heat-shrink for strain relief to avoid repeat shorts.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L99249-L99305】

#### Tires, Suspension & Ride Comfort
- Solid (honeycomb) tires remain a last resort: veterans label them harsh and skittish, steering riders toward 10×2.0–2.5″ Xuancheng pneumatics, 8.5″ tubes even in 10″ casings, ~4 bar pressures, and the mudguard/brake-wire extensions needed for the conversion.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L99996-L100007】
- Monorim documented its front suspension revisions—V4 keeps the V3 fender bracket but adds a safety brace on the lower axle plus thicker mast welds—making it the preferred option for fresh installs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L99020-L99025】

#### Security & Accessories
- Theft countermeasures layered alarms, GPS trackers, and hardened locks; several riders budgeted chain-and-alarm combos plus hidden Paj GPS beacons and still refused to leave scooters unattended for more than ~15 minutes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L100170-L100214】
- Stems collect sticker residue—tinner or dedicated adhesive remover cleans it quickly, while cooking-oil soaks work in a pinch (just keep oil off rubber and silicone parts to avoid degradation).【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L100499-L100513】

#### Rita & Firmware Notes
- Gen 2 Rita boards now report current directly, but only for discharge/regen paths; external chargers still bypass the shunt, so anyone needing wall-charge telemetry should insert their own meter between charger and port.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L100302-L100333】
- M365/1S owners chasing three riding modes flashed BLE 073, rolled to DRV 1.5.5, and then installed XiaoGen twice—the dash then presents Eco/D/S options just like a Pro.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L99676-L99690】
- Configuring Rita for mixed 12 S 1S builds means entering the actual internal capacity (7 800 mAh for stock packs) while leaving the external capacity at the booster’s rated value; over-reporting the internal pack only skews range estimates.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L100941-L100953】
- Adding a simple voltmeter to the deck requires more than two wires—builders recommended driving it through a transistor or relay tied to the 5 V logic rail so it powers up with the scooter instead of parasitically draining the pack.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L101987-L101999】

### Lines 102001–107000

#### Controllers & Firmware
- Mike UK’s V1.4 controller refresh—bigger bulk capacitance, tweaked U4 drive voltage/frequency, faster gate drive, and a revised phase-sense divider—cuts MOSFET temps by almost 10 °C, smooths 20 S regenerative braking, and cures the “yo-yo” power cut seen at 13–15 S.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L102025-L102026】
- Dash BMS version “000” usually means the controller’s telemetry stage is blown; toggling the fake gauge makes the display look full but doesn’t fix the throttling that follows, so the only real solutions are controller repair or replacement.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L102056-L102108】
- Peltier plates marketed for scooter cooling can’t sink controller heat—owners had better luck bolting MOSFETs to the deck and even adding a 5 V fan, which dropped enclosure temps from ~50 °C to ~32 °C during summer rides.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L102120-L102199】
- XiaoGen speed math still needs manual tuning: riders running 10″ wheels stick near the 7.1 % multiplier (or 7.5 % on BLE 073), while Vsett owners noted that tire squish effectively shrinks a “10 inch” setup to ~9″ for GPS-accurate telemetry.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L103076-L103085】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L105781-L105785】
- Summer heat pushes stock controllers 25–30 °C hotter than winter; repeated cut-outs around 50 °C were traced to aggressive CFW limits or weak pack connections, so owners dialed currents back and inspected wiring before blaming Rita or the BMS.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L105806-L105818】
- When rebuilding ESCs, stick with matched MOSFET pairs—mixing different N-channel parts (especially mystery AliExpress lots) is a fast way to blow the repair the moment it sees load.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L106164-L106200】

#### Rita Configuration & Charging
- A stock 42 V charger can’t top a 12 S pack; Sergey warned it either stalls or fries, so 12 S Rita users need proper 50.4 V bricks.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L102044-L102045】
- Dual-custom setups should run Rita firmware v6 in permanent-BMS mode with the correct series count entered—v5 shipped with oscillating throttle/brake behavior until users updated.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L102206-L102224】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L102231-L102233】
- Rita only shares current (and exposes telemetry) when external voltage matches or exceeds the internal pack; otherwise it favors the higher-voltage source and the app shows ghost data until voltages equalize.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L102346-L102350】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L102392-L102393】
- A single 48 V pack still fools the dashboard—expect 100 % displayed until the pack sags below ~41 V, so plan range from voltage instead of bars.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L103069-L103074】
- Riders blending 14 S externals with the stock 10 S internal in XiaoGen simply set the firmware voltage to match the higher pack and disable BMS comms only if they remove the internal battery altogether.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L106195-L106199】
- Denis confirmed the 40 A “Gen 2” Rita (including the Ninebot Max variant) entered production in mid-June after month-long road tests, so higher-current adapters are imminent.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L105675-L105684】

#### Batteries & Power Systems
- Bumping a Xiaomi BMS shunt from 1 mΩ to 0.5 mΩ (by stacking identical resistors) raises its trip point to roughly 40–45 A, but current readings halve—owners noted the math so they don’t misinterpret the logs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L105464-L105466】
- Denis’ 12 S3 P external lacks a temperature probe; he and Happy Giraffe cap discharge around 24 A to keep the three parallel cells healthy on hot summer days.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L105824-L105826】
- Parallel chains of genuine packs are viable—Dejan runs two Pro batteries plus a 12 Ah Aerdu in parallel for huge capacity—but they still need identical voltages before linking.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L105798-L105805】
- Stock 18650 and the purple LG cell revisions are both 30 A units; knowing the limit helps set realistic current targets for 36 V builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L105786-L105794】
- FlowSea’s 8 S series booster on top of a stock pack delivers roughly 75 V and 71 km/h, but the crew treated that performance as track-only—full motorcycle armor saved a friend who crashed at 87 km/h on a YYK controller build.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L106041-L106076】
- Range Boost owners can unplug the bag’s XT30 lead and fast-charge the external with a dedicated brick (or an RCA-to-XT30 adapter) while the scooter stays idle; DC-DC buck modules cover 12 V lighting draws instead of splicing straight into the 12 S bus.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L105622-L105637】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L105833-L105851】

#### Tires, Suspension & Handling
- Converting Monorim forks to pneumatic shocks still involves drilling the casting and swapping to 90° (or 45°) valves so 10×2.25–2.5″ tires clear the crown.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L102587-L102599】
- Rear 10×2.5″ installs demand shaving ~2 mm off the rim, aligning the five hub screws carefully, and taping coils so filings don’t stick to the magnets; curved valves keep tubes from kinking.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L104660-L104708】
- Monorim’s V4 kit adds a lower-axle safety brace and cleaner welds, but Kroxne’s European stock is limited and pricey—most riders now chase direct-from-Monorim supply instead.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L104746-L104755】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L104758-L104759】
- Shock tuning keeps evolving: EXA units remain the budget pick, but DNM’s 190 mm dual-chamber air shock is the premium upgrade, and even 165 mm DNM fronts are sold out across AliExpress because they ride far smoother than EXA springs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L105293-L105308】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L106152-L106159】
- V3/V4 mudguards pivot with the suspension; if the tip kisses the tire, riders shim or bend the guard, add wire supports, and re-clamp the red adapter so it doesn’t rotate on its spacers.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L106161-L106214】
- Solid tires still bite—one rider broke his elbow after a Monorim 500 W front solid jammed on scaffolding, prompting another reminder to wear motorcycle-grade protection off smooth pavement.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L105842-L105845】

#### Security & Safety
- Denis’ crew locks scooters even on trains and hides AirTags inside the stem wiring harness, but they still stress physical locks because Bluetooth trackers go silent once a thief stores the scooter indoors.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L104600-L104633】
- High-speed tuning comes with serious crash energy—stories of 70–90 km/h wipeouts and broken bones pushed the community toward full-face helmets, armored jackets, and caution with YYK controllers in traffic.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L106041-L106088】

#### Logistics & Marketplace
- Kroxne continues to irritate EU buyers with brusque support and €55 “lazy” packaging, so veterans recommend Scootermode, VTA, or direct Monorim orders instead.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L104744-L104755】
- Germany’s customs office confirmed the July 2021 change: even sub-€22 imports now accrue VAT (and often duty), making truthful declared values crucial when budgeting upgrades.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L105240-L105272】
- Jame Hoang’s €500 loss to a builder named “YC/GH” sparked a fresh scam warning—stick to trusted suppliers like Denis, Scootermode, and VTA rather than wiring money to unknown pack assemblers.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L104951-L104990】

### Lines 107001–112000

#### Battery Diagnostics, Charging & Storage
- A Pro battery that refuses to charge after an overheat warning can be reset by opening the pack and pressing the onboard button; if the LED still toggles red/green without accepting charge, measure the output (≈39 V here) and try charging through Rita’s XT30 port to confirm the BMS’ charge path has failed.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L107001-L107105】
- Long-term storage targets 3.7–3.8 V per cell (~38 V for a 10S pack); riders note that self-discharge slows around 3.7 V, so either level keeps packs healthy between rides.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L107120-L107130】
- If the battery BMS trips during parallel setups without Rita, disable the scooter’s charging mode via custom firmware; otherwise a hoverboard pack wired in parallel forces the controller into charge state whenever it’s plugged in.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L107530-L107535】
- Builders struggling with hot packs after fast rides let packs cool before charging and fall back to the XT30 harness when the stock charge inlet refuses to engage—an easy workaround while diagnosing a weak BMS.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L107545-L107548】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L107577-L107586】

#### Battery Design, Fitment & Cell Selection
- Rebuilding a Pro battery in 21700 format is feasible: the deck is ~60 mm deep, so laying cells flat with a 3–4 mm spacer keeps a 13S3P brick snug while leaving headroom for nickel, heat-shrink, and foam; standing 21700 cells upright will not clear the deck without extensions.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L107145-L107205】
- Wildman 2 L bags comfortably house 12S4P builds; 12S3P is the practical minimum for higher voltage in that shell, while 10S4P still fits when voltage boost is unnecessary.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L107222-L107232】
- When commissioning a custom pack, specify “10S5P 36 V” rather than copying cell model suffixes (e.g., “26V”)—and tell builders you expect ~30 A continuous capability to match Pro-class current demand.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L107394-L107419】
- Pairing Rita with mixed 18650/21700 packs is fine so long as every pack keeps the same series count and Rita’s configuration reflects the 13S target; the adapter simply brokers current between packs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L107142-L107149】

#### Rita Configuration, Connectors & Regen Limits
- Denis confirmed that fresh Rita batches ship with XT60 leads and include an XT30 adapter, but he still recommends wiring external batteries with native XT60 plugs (ideally via anti-spark hardware) to avoid extra resistance.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L107545-L107567】
- External 10S5P range packs remain plug-and-ride: no firmware flash is needed, the stock 42 V charger still works (charging just takes longer), and owners can add a dedicated 5 A 36 V brick if they want to maintain the original charge time.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L107544-L107548】
- Rita lead times were roughly one week in mid-June 2021 while Denis cleared a post-vacation backlog, so plan orders accordingly.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L107566-L107573】
- High regenerative braking currents still threaten hardware: keep KERS low—especially on full batteries—and remember that small external packs (e.g., 10S2P hoverboard bricks) leave little voltage headroom, so Rita may sacrifice itself to clamp a regen spike before the controller blows.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L107680-L107688】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L108309-L108315】

#### Firmware, Controllers & Performance
- Xiaomi’s BMS 1.4.1 firmware resumes charging up to 4.20 V per cell (≈12 800 mAh) instead of the older 4.05 V limit (~11 800 mAh), trading faster degradation for full capacity; riders weigh the extra range against reduced cycle life.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L107934-L107980】
- V2.1 controllers mainly revise the U4 step-down stage; even V1.4 hardware can run 12S safely once traces are reinforced, but uprated controllers offer better gate drive and thermal headroom for sustained power.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L107422-L107426】
- Monorim 500 W motors still need serious phase current before they feel lively—XiaoGen’s “32 A” eco maps translate closer to 20–25 A battery draw, so expect heat rather than torque gains when pushing beyond that on stock ESCs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L107175-L107186】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L108175-L108186】
- Parallel pack experiments should leave Rita in control and disable the scooter’s charge-mode prompts; otherwise the dash may stick in charging mode whenever a second pack is present.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L107530-L107535】

#### Tires, Brakes & Hardware Mods
- Swapping Monorim hub tires to pneumatic 10×2.5" rubber demands drilling for 90° valves, shielding the magnets from filings, and babying the five hub screws—strip one and the wheel is unusable. A slight bend on the valve stem helps clearance.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L107469-L107478】
- If the new pneumatic Monorim valve still hits the fork, rotate the tube to ~45° or add thin spacers to move the fork away, and reinforce the exposed stem so water cannot wick into the motor cavity.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L111977-L111999】
- Brake-light retrofits on custom battery builds tap the three-pin connector’s lower “T4” signal lead and ground it alongside the red/black supply pair so the tail lamp still toggles with the lever.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L112005-L112020】

#### Logistics & Market Signals
- Denis cannot ship lithium packs outside the EU, so Mongolia- or Switzerland-based riders lean on VTA, Scootermode, or local builders willing to tackle customs paperwork and higher freight costs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L107348-L107371】
- Scootermode’s June 2021 price jump (≈€170 extra for 16S packs) reflects global cell shortages; even direct cell orders were taking months and arriving 1.5× costlier, prompting heated debate but reinforcing that DIY sourcing may be the only cheaper option.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L108202-L108315】
- Some EU cities began fitting rental scooters with cameras to police sidewalk riding, while national incentives in places like the Netherlands subsidized higher-end e-mopeds—policy shifts that influence modders’ platform choices.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L111947-L111969】

### Lines 112001–117000

#### Firmware, Controllers & Telemetry
- XiaoGen’s Pro 2/1S/Essential migration still hinges on the m365Downgrade XG Mod 21 flasher: keep the scooter’s original BLE, run the migrate zip first, flash your custom firmware second, and keep an ST-Link handy in case the Bluetooth session fails mid-write.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L112524-L112527】
- Stock V3 controllers remain happiest near 27 A battery draw on 10 S packs; riders reinforce power traces, add wiring “bridges,” swap higher-voltage capacitors, and use thermal pads before creeping toward the 30 A+ XiaoGen presets that reinforced boards have sustained (even 65 A on 12 S) without overheating.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L112305-L112317】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L112411-L112417】
- Rita reports whichever pack has the higher voltage as “100 %,” so a 10 S internal battery shows ≈40 % when a 12 S external is full. Sudden loss of the auxiliary pack after braking typically points at controller or regen behaviour—especially when stacking two OEM packs—so capturing Rita settings and checking the ESC before blaming the adapter is the community’s go-to diagnostic path.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L112424-L112457】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L112462-L112465】
- Rita can still power dumb platforms: without BMS emulation you simply pre-set the target series count (10 S, 12 S, etc.) and let the adapter act as a smart diode, a trick members use on clones, ebikes, and future VESC conversions alike.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L112567-L112585】

#### Battery Packs & BMS Choices
- The Pro 2 battery’s stock BMS clips output near 30 A, so dual-motor or high-phase-current tunes need auxiliary packs (and upgraded ESCs) to avoid cut-outs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L112084-L112085】
- Doubling up two factory 10 S packs with Rita doubles range and hill torque but not speed; builders chasing higher velocity ultimately re-cell the packs into a matched 13 S block with a smart BMS, otherwise cell wear differences limit performance.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L112129-L112137】
- For 13 S builds, veterans spec ≈35–40 A common-port BMS boards on 13 S7 P internals and ~30 A units on 13 S4 P externals, noting that Rita simplifies the parallel wiring even if it isn’t strictly required for equal-voltage packs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L112653-L112691】
- Running a small 12 S3 P booster alongside the stock pack can feel slower because Rita drains the higher-voltage battery first; owners either step up to 12 S4 P (or larger) parallels or dial back current demand so the slim pack doesn’t sag under load.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L113750-L113788】
- Repurposing an M365 battery as a Pro 2 range pack is electrically viable, but riders swap in a fresh BMS before letting it share duty with the newer scooter pack.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L113723-L113731】

#### Motors, Performance & Cooling
- Upgrading to the Monorim 500 W hub buys torque headroom—not free top speed. Its lower Kv favours hills and heavy riders, while voltage boosts or dual 350 W setups still win for outright pace; reinforced controllers let the 500 W unit sip 1.5 kW bursts without roasting.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L113009-L113041】
- High-voltage experiments continue: one rider logged 47 km/h from a 250 W motor after jumping to 14 S, underscoring how voltage (and safe thermal management) matter more than nominal wattage labels.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L112743-L112768】
- Builders are adopting Grin’s Statorade ferrofluid to wick heat into the shell before climbs or summer blasts, ordering the 10 ml kits for Xiaomi-class hubs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L113859-L113860】

#### Electrical Add-Ons & Wiring
- Custom battery builds keep the stock brake light by tying its T4 signal pin (bottom of the three-pin plug) to ground alongside the red/black supply leads.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L112016-L112020】
- A keyed anti-spark switch makes for a tidy master disconnect—popular MOSFET-based e-skate units handle scooter currents (200 A bursts) and isolate both the controller and Rita when parked.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L112258-L112268】
- Panel-mounted 100 V voltmeters sip so little power that any small toggle can feed them; no high-current switch is needed when you’re only energising the display leads.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L112543-L112545】
- Monorim owners in the EU can finally buy a machined front brake adapter locally via e-watts, avoiding the scarce and pricey boutique imports.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L112749-L112753】

#### Suspension, Tires & Maintenance
- EXA A5 shock tuning guidance resurfaced: for example, a 100 kg rider targets ~165 psi in the main chamber and 75 psi in the negative chamber, with a weight-tier table provided for lighter users down to ~90 psi/50 psi.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L112468-L112475】
- Swapping Monorim’s 150 mm air can for a 165 mm unit—or removing the upper bolt before inflating—makes servicing far easier than fighting the short-stroke stocker.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L113795-L113819】
- Tire sealant remains a mixed bag: riders like the preventative coverage for glass strikes, but larger nails can still defeat Slime despite the minimal mess it leaves behind.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L113122-L113140】

#### Regulations & Community Notes
- Belgian members flagged imminent national rules that will require plates, insurance, and a 25 km/h cap for stand-up scooters, with stricter licensing once a seat is fitted—prompting locals to weigh compliance against the risk of confiscation.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L112881-L112886】

### Lines 117001–121268

#### Firmware, Flashing & Control
- XiaoGen’s migration workflow for Pro 2/1S/Essential scooters still hinges on the m365Downgrade XG Mod 21 flasher: leave BLE stock, install the XG Mod package, “Check ver,” load and flash the migrate ZIP even if it warns, then flash the custom build and keep an ST-Link handy for recovery.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L117583-L117646】
- Riders stuck at DRV200 after flashing XiaoGen on BLE 1.3.2 downgrade the dash to BLE 1.2.9 and reflash with XG Mod 21 only—other flashers are reserved for non-XiaoGen firmware to avoid soft bricks.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L117601-L117676】
- Mentors steer newcomers toward “soft” XiaoGen templates while they learn the expanded settings: build your own config, stick with XG Mod 21, and lean on guides like AngryXiaomi before experimenting with diagnostics that can throw obscure errors.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L117646-L117695】
- Paid XiaoGen builds unlock separate upper/lower brake thresholds, which makes hydraulic conversions practical because the free edition can’t set the low limit needed for smooth regen hand-offs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L120784-L120857】
- Denis warns that controller and Rita failures can cascade—either side can damage the other—and he has never seen Rita halt recovery charging on its own, so trace wiring or component faults when that symptom appears.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L121209-L121211】
- Downg can still remotely lock or unlock scooters, so flashers keep it installed for theft deterrence even when migrating to XiaoGen builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L117789-L117789】
- Riders debating throttle curves noted that XiaoGen’s quadratic power control gives precise low-speed modulation, while linear/instant curves deliver snappier launches but demand more finesse in crowds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L117704-L117712】
- Veterans cautioned against Xiaomi’s stock Mi Home app because it now caps battery voltage and cuts range; stick with scooter-hacking tools for configuration once you go custom.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L117790-L117806】

#### Battery, Charging & Rita Safety
- Rita’s app will not connect unless a battery is plugged in, and external packs must match or exceed the internal voltage before pairing.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L117168-L117172】
- If the Play Store build is outdated, grab Rita’s latest APK from Denis’ pinned messages; several July 2021 buyers could not pair until they sideloaded the current release.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L117173-L117177】
- The adapter simply shares charger current according to each pack’s resistance; chargers or BMS boards—not Rita—terminate charging, so mixed 10 S/12 S combos still need their own compliant chargers.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L117335-L117340】
- Crossing red and black leads on Rita can blow the adapter or the pack’s BMS even though the scooter still rides—check polarity and voltages before reconnecting and charging.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L117343-L117359】
- Feeding a 10 S stock pack from a 12 S external through Rita drove the internal battery to 47 V and cracked the module; veterans advise disconnecting the OEM pack when running higher-voltage externals and inspecting the internal BMS afterwards.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L120693-L120724】
- A Daly smart-BMS 14 S 5 P pack added roughly 28 km of range but was large enough to require raising the handlebars, and riders still had to solve cooling separately.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L121226-L121229】
- 20 AWG copper charge leads tolerate ~5 A, but flimsy charge plugs let you mis-seat connectors—double-check with a meter before assuming the BMS failed.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L117183-L117191】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L117370-L117379】
- Samsung 40T packs wired 20 S3 P can accept 5–6 A charges (~1.8 A per cell); higher rates shorten life, so match the charger to the BMS limits for longevity.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L117791-L117810】
- If a miswired 12 S pack “pops,” isolate Rita while you test each battery separately—charge the external on its own, then unplug the adapter to confirm whether the internal BMS still accepts the stock charger before replacing hardware.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L117751-L117756】
- Daly’s Bluetooth telemetry requires buying a smart BMS—the basic boards cannot be upgraded with an add-on module after purchase.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L121240-L121242】
- Bypassing the discharge BMS to chase more torque quickly triggered internal error 21, yanked the stock pack down near 30 V, and revealed swollen capacitors—keep the BMS inline for discharge as well as charging to avoid catastrophic faults.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L121248-L121268】

#### Motors, Performance & Thermal Management
- A Monorim 500 W hub underwhelms on 10 S because it is a low‑Kv 13 S motor; the group reports better climbing once it sees 13–15 S and ~1.5 kW support from the controller and batteries.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L117772-L117786】
- Hammering a 300 W stock motor with 32 A in mountainous terrain baked the hall glue and stator—plan for beefier hubs or lower current in hilly regions.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L117175-L117188】
- Riders are coating hub stators with ferrofluid (Statorade) to wick heat into the shell before hard summer rides.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L117817-L117820】
- Star/delta dual-drive experiments sound appealing, but without matching Kv and current limits the wheels end up fighting each other and overheating controllers.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L120673-L120754】
- Jumping to a 16 S battery paired with a VESC and higher-Kv motor is the community’s go-to recipe when chasing 80 km/h builds beyond what 10 S packs can safely support.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L121221-L121224】
- Fresh ferrofluid reports called Statorade “magic”—after filling the hub, riders couldn’t get it more than hand-warm even after repeated uphill blasts.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L117822-L117881】

#### Wiring, Connectors & Electronics
- Phase colors differ across third-party motors; community members shared mapping charts and reiterated the JST PAP family used on Xiaomi harnesses (PAP-03V-S for BMS, -04V-S for BLE, -05V-S for hall sensors).【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L117250-L117254】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L118461-L118465】
- Buy MOSFETs from reputable distributors such as Farnell, Mouser, Digikey, or TME—AliExpress/Amazon parts are routinely counterfeit or used pulls.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L120236-L120252】
- Paolo’s high-voltage checklist covers capacitor swaps, MOSFET options, resistor tweaks, and mandatory pre-charge steps for pushing Xiaomi controllers from 13 S up to 20 S safely.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L120289-L120291】
- Builders weighing VESC upgrades noted that the €150 Ubox delivers adaptive FOC, 150 A phase current, and native Bluetooth telemetry compared to reinforced Xiaomi ESCs that plateau near 60 A.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L118101-L118139】

#### Tires, Brakes & Mechanical Work
- Fitting 10″ tires involves rerouting the rear light cable bracket, pulling stripped screws with locking pliers, and reshaping the mudguard with heat; up front, put Monorim washers inside the arms to stop side play.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L117137-L117166】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L117507-L117509】
- Hydraulic brake swaps may need caliper grinding, new hall sensors with magnetic shims, and XiaoGen’s paid brake calibration to keep regen modulation intact.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L120784-L120853】
- Magura MT5e calipers struggle on the stock rim without flipping the cable or switching to narrower Wheelway rims; several riders favor Nutt hydraulics as a simpler drop-in.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L120155-L120164】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L120170-L120176】
- When taming Monorim wobble, reposition the headset washers inside the fork arms and add extra shims so the axle clamps pull square—leaving spacers outside just lets the arms dance.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L117440-L117509】

#### Logistics, Suppliers & Regulations
- German enforcement now fines scooters heavily once they exceed 22 km/h, with penalties escalating for higher-income riders and potential licence points for phone use on the move.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L118482-L118491】
- UK buyers reported MyBestScooter pausing overseas shipping; contacting the shop directly or using its EU storefront still works for sourcing V3 controllers.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L120664-L120669】
- Denis reiterated that mainstream Rita units cap out at 15 S and 25 A because supporting higher-spec adapters would stretch his resources; de-potted or fan-modded variants aren’t offered to limit warranty risk.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L118517-L118531】
- Amazon and marketplace listings keep shipping counterfeit Monorim hardware—some, like Iscooting, have sent obviously fake forks—so cross-check sellers with community recommendations before buying.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L117097-L117111】
- Xiaomi’s 2021 “Pro 3/Mi 3” refresh barely upgrades the scooter: same motor and weaker 474 Wh battery, a token folding fix, and even tighter firmware limits, so modders still prefer a cheaper Pro plus Denis’ kit.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L117842-L117857】
- Cell shortages are pushing pack prices up—Scootermode’s 13 S 4 P now sits around €340 and even resellers admit prices may not fall soon.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L117888-L117906】
