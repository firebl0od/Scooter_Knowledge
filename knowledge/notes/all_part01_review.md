## Key Findings

### Battery Maintenance & BMS Compatibility
- Critically unbalanced Xiaomi packs should be top-balanced per parallel group (e.g., groups 6/8/9) with an external charger such as TP4056 modules; the procedure can be performed without disconnecting the BMS, using crocodile clips for convenience.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1-L15】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L16-L19】
- M365 BMS Tool fails against the newest BLE firmware; downgrading the scooter’s BLE to version 073 restores connectivity and still allows custom firmware such as Gonka.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L16-L18】
- Denis’ repair BMS supports 10S4P packs today, with a 12S-capable model tentatively targeted for release around August 2020; shipping to Belgium typically takes one to two weeks despite pandemic delays.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L20-L33】

### Rita Adapter Capabilities & Limits
- Rita is designed for Xiaomi data-line behavior: it only supports parallel battery additions (not series stacks), can emulate the BMS when set to “permanent BMS emulator,” and can be configured over Bluetooth or via a serial tool when no Xiaomi dashboard is present.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L36-L149】
- The adapter is sold directly through m365.embedden.com to avoid ~20 % eBay fees; Denis also publishes installation guides and documentation for external battery builds and BMS repairs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L51-L156】
- Range Boost kits double an M365 Pro’s usable range because the external pack matches the stock capacity and charges through the OEM charger; Range+Speed kits require firmware changes when disconnecting the extra battery, whereas the range-only kit does not.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L160-L178】
- When grafted into non-Xiaomi clones without data lines, Rita can still arbitrate current as a pair of smart diodes, letting riders run only an auxiliary pack, though they forfeit fine-grained cutoff settings; charging behavior prioritizes whichever pack sits at higher voltage, then shares current, and the module independently routes charger input to the correct pack ports.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L642-L701】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L662-L670】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1187-L1189】
- Rita tolerates roughly 30 A output and can be power-cycled with an anti-spark switch between adapter and controller without harming charge management.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L742-L745】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1088-L1094】
- Rita can operate with 12S internal/external packs and blocks current flow between packs rather than equalizing voltages, so mismatched states of charge persist until riding draws them down; pairing unlike series counts (e.g., 10S with 12S) remains unsafe without firmware support.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L337-L345】
- Sustained power above roughly 1 kW risks overheating; Rita substitutes its own temperature telemetry when it seizes the scooter data line, so riders should heed its limits when pushing higher-current firmware tunes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L320-L322】
- The BMS Tool exposes Rita’s “permanent emulator” toggle for data-line-less builds and supports 13S configurations once riders change the internal battery setting from 10 to 13 series cells; Rita reports a standby +5 V on whichever pack input is idle, which Denis confirms is normal.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L748-L767】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1088-L1094】
- Factory harnesses ship with XT30 male leads on the adapter side, and Denis sticks with XT30 hardware (rather than XT60) because it fits the housing and safely handles the targeted current levels.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1080-L1083】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1509-L1516】
- Rita’s telemetry app will alternate between the scooter BMS and the external pack whenever their voltages are close; keep the auxiliary battery a few tenths of a volt higher (or temporarily disconnect it) to view external stats, as the shared data bus only exposes whichever side currently leads.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5154-L5174】

### Logistics & Fulfillment Notes
- Denis ships adapters worldwide via his storefront but must use ground carriers for lithium packs, preventing combined kit shipments to regions like Kuwait; Rita units alone can ship by post or UPS once custom rates are arranged.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L198-L235】
- Pandemic logistics continued to bite: by late June he still lacked a global lithium solution and limited battery exports to Europe, while juggling batch production (30 Rita boards, 15 bags, 9 batteries shipped on 29 June).【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1098-L1100】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1478-L1484】
- Complete Rita+bag+battery kits cost roughly €250–€280 plus ~€20 shipping depending on charger inclusion, reflecting low-volume manufacturing economics and quality components like Samsung 35E cells and branded XT30 connectors.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1446-L1512】
- Denis hand-added UPS options for Kuwait and fielded inquiries from Kenya while catching up on a week-plus order backlog; by mid-June he was still solo-packing batches and quoting June 17–20 restocks before resuming sales.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L200-L252】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L746-L767】
- Batteries remained Europe-only shipments, with DHL-Express bringing BMS restocks from China and custom 13S builds accepted on pre-order once charger supply stabilized (roughly 2–3 weeks lead).【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L833-L845】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1098-L1100】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1438-L1445】
- August buyers continued to see roughly 10-day door-to-door timelines within Europe as Denis assembled packs early in the week and shipped mid-week, though he reminded riders that DPD will only move lithium batteries inside the EU (blocking Norway orders).【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4756-L4773】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5891-L5892】
- 12S charger stock remained tight until his supplier returned from holiday; Denis shared snapshots of incoming units and cautioned that the battery builder’s vacation meant 12S packs would resume shipping mid-August.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5440-L5447】
- By 14 August Denis quoted three business days to assemble a battery and confirmed regional stock nodes—Poland and London—for faster Rita fulfillment while batteries continued to ship from Europe only.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6077-L6086】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6324-L6326】

### Motor Cooling & Modification Takeaways
- Denis dismisses rim-mounted “cooling fans,” arguing that real airflow at 30 km/h already refreshes the hub shell; effective cooling requires improving heat transfer from the stator (e.g., via ferrofluid) rather than blowing ambient air on the cover.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L422-L541】
- Community feedback notes ferrofluid availability challenges (commonly sourced from Russia/Australia) and typical fill volumes around 5–10 ml per hub; Denis warns that a cool motor shell after hard riding indicates poor conduction and questions the additive’s effectiveness.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L521-L548】

### External Battery Sourcing & Fitment Guidance
- Riders compared AliExpress packs versus Denis’ LG-cell builds, emphasizing the need for honest capacity ratings and matching battery dimensions to Wildman 1–3 L bags or Denis’ dedicated mounts; 2 L bags comfortably house ~8 Ah bricks, while cheaper listings often exaggerate capacity.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L688-L733】
- Denis resells batteries at cost and encouraged the community to surface reputable Chinese suppliers and verify actual capacities before purchase.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L697-L705】
- M365 dashboards can be retrofitted onto base models for richer telemetry, independent of Rita, via simple three-wire swaps or aftermarket boards such as m365dash.com offerings.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1255-L1267】
- Wildman’s E2 (≈180 × 105 × 83 mm) hard case reliably fits Denis’ 8 Ah-class packs, while the 1 L shell only houses compact 36 V hoverboard bricks; the 3 L size is bulky but workable, and riders often rely on 3D-printed brackets to secure the bags cleanly.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L720-L735】
- Builders favor quality cells and wiring (e.g., Sony-based 36 V 15 Ah packs, 12 AWG leads) and caution that XT30 disconnects are not designed for frequent hot-plugging—reinforced, semi-permanent joints are safer for Rita installs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1035-L1059】
- Denis’ turnkey packs use shared charge/discharge leads; charging them off-scooter requires a dedicated adapter harness once the pack is removed from Rita’s loom.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1101-L1144】
- The standard Rita kit still ships with the 2 L Wildman hard case—12S4P bricks just clear the enclosure—and Denis advised waiting for future production runs before requesting 10S5P or 12S5P customs sized for the 3 L variant.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5320-L5335】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5460-L5473】
- Denis currently pairs his 10S packs with Daly 36 V 25 A common-port BMS boards and noted that higher parallel counts remain on hold until supply stabilizes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5470-L5477】

### Standalone Charging & Port Considerations
- Denis’ external packs integrate a BMS but share charge/discharge leads, so field charging requires an adapter harness; Rita otherwise charges internal packs through their native ports and external packs via the common XT connector, making workplace top-offs feasible when the battery stays on the scooter.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1100-L1144】
- When battery BMS units expose separate charge jacks, Rita cannot halt overcharge via the discharge lead, so common-port packs remain the safest plug-and-play option.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1191-L1194】
- Denis confirmed on 18 August that Rita directs charge current toward whichever pack sits lower in voltage, reassuring 12S owners who see telemetry swing between ~50 V at rest and ~24 V while the charger tops up the lower pack.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6515-L6533】
- Denis advised interrupting power between Rita and the scooter controller—not between battery and Rita—when adding anti-spark switches so charging logic remains intact.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1088-L1094】
- Users experimenting with multi-pack fleets confirmed Rita automatically tops whichever pack sits below the charger voltage and that external-only charging sessions demand manual harness swaps once the auxiliary pack leaves the scooter.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1171-L1189】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1101-L1144】
- 12S builds cannot rely on Xiaomi’s 42 V charger; riders either rework the OEM brick with 14.3 kΩ feedback resistors or adopt higher-voltage CC/CV supplies, accepting that Rita still funnels both packs through a single inlet unless the external battery is unplugged for standalone charging.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4511-L4524】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4759-L4773】
- Denis pointed 12S owners toward Mean Well ELG-240-48A-class supplies and warned that sourcing Xiaomi’s coaxial plug is often the hardest step when building custom chargers.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4760-L4773】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4813-L4815】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4920-L4922】

### Extended Battery Pricing, BMS Selection & Charging Behavior
- Denis prices his turnkey 10S4P pack at roughly €170 with Wildman bag around €30 and shipping near €20, underscoring that he uses Samsung 35E cells, 20 A common-port BMS boards, and genuine XT30 connectors sized to fit the scooter’s inlet better than XT60 hardware.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1501-L1525】
- His smart internal BMS employs separate charge/discharge leads, so he avoids it in auxiliary packs; instead, external batteries rely on single XT30 leads, letting Rita and the scooter’s charge port fill both packs in parallel while 20 A BMS units are recommended (15 A variants work but sag slightly).【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1545-L1595】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1803-L1812】
- Rita can refill internal and external packs through the stock charge jack even on mixed 10S/12S setups, supports simultaneous charger use, and sequences charge on mismatched voltages (internal pack halts at 42 V before a 12S/13S unit continues toward 50.4–54.6 V); Denis cautions that feeding the internal pack with a 54.6 V source leaves only the BMS as over-voltage protection.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1800-L1812】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2280-L2287】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2591-L2595】
- Without Rita, paralleling packs risks bypassing external BMS safeguards; Dimitrij stresses keeping the BMS in circuit and warns that an 8 Ah pack can fail violently, while Denis notes Rita’s dual inputs tolerate only equal-voltage paralleled packs and require “permanent BMS emulation” when no smart data line exists.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2785-L2805】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2970-L2986】
- The 12S3P “range+speed” combo remains the preferred upgrade but hinges on sourcing or modifying a 50.4 V charger; Denis pulled the pre-bundled kit once chargers ran out, advising DIY resistor swaps, while positioning the 10S pack as a plug-and-play range boost for riders unwilling to touch firmware or chargers.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1924-L1925】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2547-L2549】
- Denis confirmed current 12S3P kits ride on Samsung 35E cells (≈10.35 Ah at 44.4 V) and that pricing reflects premium parts versus AliExpress options alongside the labor of hand-built batches.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4913-L4918】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4761-L4764】
- Range+Speed bundles still tally around €260 while standalone 12S4P packs cost roughly €230 because of the additional cells and wiring, so 3 L bag experiments escalate budgets quickly as parallels increase.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5319-L5335】
- Builders exploring 21700 and 26650 formats observed that a 12S4P 21700 pack matches 12S6P 18650 capacity but strains enclosure space, making bag volume the limiting factor for ultra-long-range goals.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5908-L5935】

### Firmware, Controller & Recovery Lessons
- Rita ships preconfigured but 12S users must raise the firmware over-voltage limit to roughly 51 V (and typically disable charge-mode prompts) via tools like XiaoFlasher and Denis’ video guide, whereas 10S riders can stay on stock firmware; connecting to the Rita app still demands downgrading BLE to 072/090 on Xiaomi dashboards.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1860-L1872】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1924-L1925】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2509-L2513】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2719-L2722】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2919-L2920】
- Bricked controllers can be revived with an ST-Link and stock 1.5.5 firmware, but users report that flashing mismatched images (e.g., BLE 126 onto Denis’ BMS) triggers error 21 until reflashed; Denis and the community steer riders toward established videos and forum tools when recovering from failed DownG attempts.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1891-L1900】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1812-L1818】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1920-L1925】
- Custom firmware discussions settle on ≈27 A (≈800 W) as a safe sustained draw for Xiaomi drivetrains; Denis reminds riders that 350 W hub motors can only tolerate kilowatt-level surges briefly before overheating, and higher phase/battery current settings drain packs rapidly despite headline speed gains.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2500-L2526】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2200-L2207】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2338-L2347】
- Modding the stock charger with Vishay 14.3 kΩ feedback resistors lets it output 50.4 V for 12S packs; Denis still recommends upgrading OEM units instead of trusting unknown third-party bricks and stresses proper soldering technique (use flux, check for shorts) during the conversion.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2213-L2241】
- Error code crib sheets shared mid-chat list ESC fault numbers (e.g., 28 for HS FET issues), helping diagnose post-mod anomalies such as MOSFET swaps gone wrong.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2243-L2249】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2300-L2304】

### Motor Upgrades, Performance & Safety Anecdotes
- Riders experimenting with 350 W aftermarket hubs found higher peak wattage but lazier launches versus stock 300 W units, suggesting firmware current limits—and voltage boosts like 12S packs—matter more than nominal motor labels for real-world torque.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2614-L2695】
- Community members warned against spoofing tire sizes to inflate dashboard speed since GPS and hardware ceilings still cap Xiaomi scooters around 35 km/h on 42 V packs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2633-L2667】
- High-speed downhill runs with KERS disabled have cooked BMS boards in wet conditions, reinforcing earlier advice to keep regenerative braking within safe thresholds and protect electronics from water ingress.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2678-L2694】

### Accessory Fitment & Community Tips
- The Wildman hard case Denis bundles is the 2 L variant; larger 3 L shells exist, but most Rita owners find the 2 L format the right compromise for 10S packs and cable clearance.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2775-L2786】
- Denis contracts 3Dway Kraków to print his rear mounting brackets and keeps the STL private as a commercial design, though riders continue to request custom current limits (e.g., 65 A phase, 35 A battery) for bigger motors.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2701-L2737】
- Large-capacity builds discussed extremes such as 60 V 40 Ah packs delivering ~130 km range at ~11 kg, illustrating the weight/range trade-offs when leaving Xiaomi’s 36 V ecosystem.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1501-L1507】

### Fulfillment & Payment Updates (July 2020)
- UK demand spiked in early July, with Denis’ sales map showing the region as his hottest market while local reseller Dimitrij handled Rita distribution and accepted preorders for July 13 dispatches.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1691-L1743】
- Logistics headwinds persisted: he paused complete kits when 12S chargers dried up, juggled bag shortages (debating emergency buys from Polish resellers), and leaned on ground carriers like DPD/UPS/TNT because DHL air won’t fly lithium packs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1924-L1938】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2556-L2565】
- By late July he faced payment-gateway outages that blocked battery sales; Ritas, BMS boards, and bags stayed online, but chargers and packs slipped to mid-August estimates while he navigated Russian-to-Polish bank transfers.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2924-L2965】
- Customers eager for range packs were asked to check back once supplier payments resumed, though Denis hoped to reopen sales within days and flagged Revolut as a potential—but operationally awkward—workaround.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L2966-L2998】

### Charger Upgrades & High-Voltage Builds
- Denis paused bundled 12S “range+speed” kits because compatible 50.4 V chargers were out of stock, though he offered 12S batteries to DIYers willing to modify chargers; 10S kits remained available for range-only needs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1268-L1276】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1371-L1374】
- He documented how to retune Xiaomi’s stock charger for 12S packs by replacing the 10 kΩ feedback resistor with a 30 kΩ+27 kΩ stack (~14.3 kΩ) and trimming the output to 50.4 V via the adjustment pot.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1280-L1286】
- Chargers limited to ~2 A may fail to replenish both packs when sharing Rita’s inlet; higher-output units (≥3–4 A) should balance speed with thermal limits of the internal BMS and wiring harnesses.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1287-L1319】
- Denis warned that 5 A BMS firmware hacks overheat legacy M365 boards to ~150 °C, shortening their life even if the scooter seems fine; Pro revisions tolerate higher current better, but quality MOSFETs, reinforced traces, and tempered charger voltages remain mandatory for 12S–13S builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1304-L1355】
- Community builders detune aftermarket chargers (e.g., Vruzend 13S units) to ~54 V for longevity and pair them with reputable Daly/Daly-style BMS modules when upgrading AliExpress packs to honest capacities.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1369-L1380】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1216-L1264】

### High-Voltage & Component Stress Insights
- Users exploring 12S–13S builds highlighted the need for quality MOSFETs, reinforced controller traces, and conservative charger voltages (e.g., dialing 54 V on 13S Vruzend chargers) to survive higher loads.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1238-L1249】
- Denis cautioned that 5 A charge firmware hacks overheat legacy M365 BMS boards (~150 °C), whereas newer Pro revisions tolerate higher current; his kits leverage Samsung 35E cells and reputable 20 A BMS modules sourced from AliExpress.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1304-L1344】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1431-L1436】
- While 13S and even 15S are electrically possible on recent hardware, Denis warned older scooters cannot handle the voltage without resistor swaps and broader component upgrades.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1445-L1454】

### Maintenance & Repair Tips
- Water-damaged M365 packs often revive after cleaning the BMS with isopropyl alcohol; if cell telemetry still misreports, Denis sells compatible replacements.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L1422-L1428】
- External accessories like LED strips require appropriate step-down converters since most consumer strips are rated ≤24 V, making direct 36 V taps unsafe.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L929-L938】
- A regen-heavy stop without Rita protection scorched a customer’s BMS and controller; Denis urged disconnecting the pack immediately, recharging sub-2 V cells individually, and reworking any sloppy sensor wiring before blaming the board.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L780-L830】
- Dashboard brownouts triggered by headlight toggles generally indicate BMS faults—Denis advised swapping in a known-good pack, checking each parallel group, and replacing fuses before condemning the scooter’s electronics if soldering skills are limited.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5450-L5457】
- Solid tires remain a last resort: veterans noted they consume ~20 % more energy, ride harsher, and can fatigue battery tabs, recommending 10" pneumatic CST/Wanda options, reinforced tubes, and fair labor pricing instead.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4524-L4744】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4782-L4788】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5486-L5496】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5582-L5589】

### Serial Debugging & Clone Scooter Caveats
- Serial access requires FTDI ground tied to Rita ground, TX on yellow, RX on white, and a pull-up resistor (≈1–10 kΩ) because Rita’s TX pin is open-drain; powering the board from any battery pack is sufficient for configuration.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L578-L618】
- When used on non-M365 clones without BMS telemetry, Rita functions as a pair of smart diodes: only same-series-count packs are supported, regenerative braking must remain disabled, and serial tweaking is optional despite curiosity from early adopters.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L585-L640】

### Repair BMS & Rita Deployment Updates (July–August 2020)
- Denis confirmed the repair BMS mounting holes are 4 mm and reiterated that it can be configured over a simple CP2102-class USB-UART link, letting clone scooters without Xiaomi dashboards adopt the board.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3003-L3010】
- Rita can still support scooters that do not expect BMS telemetry on the data line, keeping external-pack builds viable beyond the Xiaomi range.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3105-L3106】

### High-Voltage Upgrades & Controller Preparation
- Moving from 10S to 12S (≈44 V) requires three steps—flash higher-voltage firmware, reinforce controller power traces, and source or mod a 50.4 V charger—after which riders see roughly 36 km/h, ~800 W output, and ~50 km range with an auxiliary pack.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3011-L3025】
- Denis cautioned that unlocking the “hardware speed limit” for 12S gains adds danger; he advises keeping firmware-limited speeds near 34 km/h despite ~20 % voltage headroom and rider reports of 38.5 km/h on standard frames.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3107-L3116】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3122-L3129】
- Rita ships with XT30 harnesses (XT60 shells do not fit the frame), caps current near 30 A (~1.5 kW at 13S), and still expects users to align pack voltages before running dual external batteries or bumping to 13S builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3119-L3162】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3953-L3966】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4295-L4298】
- Denis urged prospective 13S riders to cut Rita’s pink sense lead, keep the XT30 connector, and remember that meaningful performance still arrives at 12S without extra charger hassles.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3742-L3746】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4337-L4343】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4370-L4378】
- He reiterated that 10S packs house 40 cells versus 36 in his 12S3P builds, so riders chasing endurance over speed should not ignore the denser 10S option.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3826-L3844】

### External Battery Selection, Charging & Maintenance
- Separate charge-port batteries remain risky with Rita because the adapter cannot halt over-voltage through the discharge lead; Denis continues to steer riders toward common-port BMS packs or replacing the board entirely.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3070-L3090】
- Denis re-opened battery sales with 10S4P packs shipping next week and limited 12S4P stock priced at about €230 once charger shortages ease after the team’s early-August holiday; he also reminded buyers of his “Antarctica” shipping workaround when bundling orders.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3520-L3596】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3742-L3757】
- Community testing shows 12S Rita kits can log 43 km/h bursts while mixed-pack riders must still monitor heat (~71 °C motors) and reinforce controllers to survive sustained >500 W tunes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3553-L3554】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3799-L3804】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3842-L3848】
- Denis validated that his repair BMS will balance itself back to 100 % over one to two weeks if “balance mode” stays set to “always,” though users can still top-balance stubborn cells manually.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3857-L3866】
- 21700 cells are viable for custom internal packs and offer straightforward capacity gains, but over-volting ESA-class scooters still demands careful charger planning.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3900-L3918】
- Mid-August Q&A reiterated that Rita draws from the higher-voltage pack until voltages equalize, then shares the load, underscoring why external packs need honest capacity and common-port BMS boards.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6107-L6115】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6254-L6264】
- Denis steered builders toward 25–30 A common-port 13S BMS options for Rita, warning that higher-rated or separate-charge boards complicate installs and can starve the adapter.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6259-L6266】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6832-L6883】
- Attempting to expand his finished 12S3P packs proved impractical; Denis advised ordering a fresh build from his Krakow supplier instead of retrofitting extra parallel groups.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6374-L6403】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6404-L6407】

### App Connectivity & Instrumentation Notes
- Multiple users saw the M365 BMS Tool report blank data after rides despite BLE 090 firmware; Denis advised ensuring the external pack sits ~0.5 V above the internal pack for Rita to appear, killing other Bluetooth apps, downgrading BLE if necessary, or trying older Android builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3241-L3308】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4295-L4304】
- Rita only reports as the primary BMS when the external battery leads internal voltage by roughly 0.5 V, so telemetry will toggle between packs during mixed-charge scenarios.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4295-L4300】

### Accessories, Cooling & Charging Etiquette
- Denis maintained that stick-on hub “coolers” are cosmetic; real gains come from thermal conduction improvements, while controller reinforcement (soldered trace thickening) remains mandatory once riders chase ~850 W or more.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3203-L3210】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3984-L3990】
- The community continues to favor X-Tech semi-hydraulic brakes, 130–140 mm rotors, and even hydraulic bicycle kits for stronger stopping, with Denis recommending Torx T10 fasteners (ideally countersunk) to keep deck plates sealed.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3520-L3539】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3867-L3879】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4083-L4114】
- Charging etiquette threads reiterated plugging the charger into the scooter before the wall outlet to reduce inrush sparks, advice Denis echoed alongside reminders that Rita automatically shares the stock charge port across both packs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4158-L4170】
- Denis reconfirmed Samsung 35E cells as his default (20 A-class) pick, noting that Rita shares load between packs so higher-current 25R cells are unnecessary for most builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4019-L4032】

### Sales & Fulfillment Developments (Late July–Early August 2020)
- Payment processing remained RUB-only with banks blocking PayPal support; Denis promised two-week timelines to resolve banking hurdles and manually confirmed shipments for orders stalled by card-processor quirks.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3013-L3021】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3091-L3101】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4449-L4484】
- Battery production paused August 1–10 while his pack builder took vacation and charger deliveries caught up; orders placed during that window ship once assembly restarts around August 10–15.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3520-L3596】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L3742-L3757】
- Denis reminded buyers that his Wildman bag kits top out at roughly 20 cm pack lengths (≈25×7×7 cm bricks will not fit) and that support tickets should include order IDs so he can reconcile manual bank confirmations.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4407-L4448】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4449-L4484】

### Firmware Recovery, Controller Tuning & Experimental Mods (August 2020)
- Multiple riders bricked controllers while flashing 51 V-ready custom firmware; ST-Link recoveries succeed once pogo pins make firm contact with ESC pads and pinouts are confirmed—floating leads were the most common cause of failed reflashes.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4641-L4676】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5111-L5149】
- Denis and moderators reiterated that 13S packs demand hardware changes: cut Rita’s pink sense wire, upgrade the controller, and expect limited guidance until official documentation catches up—most riders find 12S’s ~20 % boost ample.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4930-L4948】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5284-L5289】
- Veteran tuners cautioned against pushing past ~27 k current targets on stock controllers or mixing configuration generators; mismatched 33 k presets and ignored thermal upgrades have already destroyed MOSFETs despite moderate dashboard temperatures.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4950-L4974】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4988-L5008】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5986-L5999】
- Community engineers showcased a Ninebot G30 “delta mod” that rewires the stator from star to delta on demand for 55–66 km/h blasts; the experiment highlights how much stronger the G30 controller is compared to unreinforced M365 boards, which burned under the same load.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5035-L5073】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5085-L5096】

### Tire, Suspension & Folding Hardware Upgrades
- Riders endorsed CST V3 and Wanda 10" pneumatic tires with thicker tubes for heavy riders, noting that solid tires sap roughly 20 % more energy, reduce grip, and can still puncture tubes during install; proper pressure based on rider weight remains essential.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4524-L4588】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4730-L4743】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4750-L4793】
- X-Tech HB100 brake adopters shared pad part numbers, spacer advice, and rotor sizing (140 mm for Pro, 120 mm for base models) to ease conversions.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4589-L4726】

### Rita Configuration & High-Voltage Safeguards (Late August 2020)
- Denis reiterated that plugging 13S packs into Rita without cutting the dedicated jumper will destroy the adapter; riders must follow the official manual via the M365 BMS Tool and downgrade BLE to 090/074 for configuration before enabling higher cell counts.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7538-L7562】
- 13S builds still require controller-side preparation (reinforced traces and corrected voltage dividers); buyers of aftermarket ESCs should confirm those changes with the vendor rather than assuming compatibility.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7571-L7578】
- Returning to 10S operation after cutting the jumper is unsafe without restoring it; Denis urged riders not to exceed 12S until they fully understand the hardware protections described in the manual.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7956-L7975】
- Rita + Speed kits run on the Xiaomi Pro 2 when paired with Xiaoflasher’s paid firmware, but the community still cannot connect that scooter to the M365 BMS Tool, leaving configuration to other apps.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7976-L7980】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8100-L8101】

### Regeneration, Firmware & Controller Lessons
- Raising Rita’s “recuperation off cell voltage” threshold to about 4.15 V resolves throttle kicks on 12S/13S packs; Denis detailed how the parameter prevents regen until both batteries fall below the limit.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7914-L7927】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7801-L7809】
- Firmware “intensity of current change” values around 400 mA overstress controllers even with reinforced tracks; experienced tuners cap the step near 300–350 mA to preserve MOSFETs while keeping throttle response acceptable.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7822-L7835】
- Heavy regen presets such as CWF W can burn unreinforced controller traces within a few emergency stops, so builders combine modest braking-current settings with mechanical upgrades (larger rotors/X-Tech calipers).【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8843-L8849】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8865-L8875】
- Rita continues charging the external pack after the scooter powers down; riders should rely on the charger LED (green = full) to confirm completion.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7749-L7755】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7762-L7765】

### Logistics & Regional Availability Updates (Aug 26–Sep 1 2020)
- EU buyers reported three-day delivery from Poland and confirmed Denis’ 12S packs ship with YZPower chargers rated for 20 A continuous discharge, which tolerate short bursts above spec.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7669-L7682】
- Denis quoted roughly £290 delivered for a full 12S kit to the UK and about €325 to Finland, with no additional VAT/import fees inside the EU.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7930-L7941】
- Lithium batteries remain EU-only shipments: Norway and Turkey customers can order electronics or accessories, but battery orders lack shipping options because Denis cannot export packs there.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8102-L8130】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8857-L8860】

### Battery Quality, BMS Selection & Pack-Build Lessons
- AliExpress 10S packs with separate charge ports are incompatible with Rita’s charge-sharing—replace their BMS with a common-port board to avoid uncontrolled overcharge through the discharge leads.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8784-L8785】
- Quality packs cost at least ~€100 in materials before labor and taxes; Denis and other builders warned that cheaper imports often hide weak cells, poor BMS hardware, and abusive manufacturing practices.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8789-L8794】
- Denis’ repair BMS defaults to 4.15 V per cell (≈4.14 V after the internal diode drop) but allows users to raise or lower that ceiling for longevity or range goals.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8354-L8356】
- Dashboards reading ~91 % at 50.1 V on 12S packs are a UI quirk—the pack is effectively 99 % charged despite the lower display figure.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8184-L8188】
- Field tests showed Denis’ repair BMS sustaining 37 A for over 10 s when stacked with another 10S pack; the main limitation of earlier boards is a 3 A charge current, making dual chargers or patience necessary.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8377-L8387】
- Builders emphasized leaving the final few percent uncharged to prolong Li-ion life, and they urged adding insulation (fish paper or tape) when gluing dense packs to mitigate thermal and abrasion risks.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8343-L8352】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8804-L8816】

### Hardware Fitment, Maintenance & Instrumentation Tips
- Controller connector paste should be non-conductive thermal compound to aid heat transfer without risking shorts.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7513-L7519】
- Stuck front hub bolts demand a long, rigid wrench (not the soft Monorim tool), lubricant, and bracing the scooter with body weight; replace rounded fasteners with higher-grade hardware once removed.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8105-L8177】
- Monorim steering that binds after installation is usually overtightened—back the central stem bolt off a quarter turn, temporarily loosen the side clamps, or swap back to the stock bolt before reinserting the suspension pump.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8204-L8248】
- 10" conversions require relocating rear-light wiring, sealing edges with epoxy, and sometimes trimming mudguard plastics; riders settled around 4 bar rear/3.5 bar front to balance comfort and clearance.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8301-L8307】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8865-L8874】
- Some riders trim the rear deck reinforcement for extra clearance, but heavier owners prefer keeping the rib intact and instead rely on spacers and precise tire selection.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8901-L8918】
- Denis’ customers routinely relocate the charge port higher on the scooter and re-seal the deck to keep grime out once 10" tires and relocated wiring are installed.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8306-L8309】
- Bluetooth temperature loggers powered by CR2032 cells provide inexpensive real-time monitoring for experimental high-power packs and ESCs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8752-L8759】

### Lighting, Visibility & Range Accessories
- Helmet or backpack-mounted turn signals sit at eye level and remain visible in daylight, unlike low fender kits that other traffic may miss.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7501-L7522】
- Re-routing the rear light harness and potting connections protects the cable from 10" tire rubbing, while reflective tape or inexpensive sticker kits boost visibility without bulky add-ons.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8301-L8307】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8931-L8937】
- Multi-pack Rita adapters, anti-spark links, and backpack enclosures support dual 12S packs (~24.6 Ah, 6.1 kg) that can stretch range toward 80 km when carefully managed.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L8316-L8321】
- Foldster/X-Lock clamps curb stem wobble on ESA clones and stock M365s alike; careful bag placement prevents latch interference, though cumulative upgrades quickly exceed the scooter’s purchase price.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5327-L5364】
- Front-suspension retrofits and printable mudguard brackets circulate on Thingiverse/Yeggi; builders recommended sourcing genuine Monorim parts from reputable EU sellers to avoid weaker clones and pairing the swap with 10" pneumatic conversions for best comfort.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5155-L5203】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5486-L5500】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5869-L5875】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5949-L5957】
- August chatter flagged 3D-printed suspension supports, Monorim sourcing tips, and lock extender kits that relocate the folding latch for better Wildman-bag clearance; genuine Monorim hardware remains scarce and pricier via EU resellers.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6122-L6195】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6481-L6512】
- Riders debated 10" conversions versus 8.5" setups—consensus favored 10" pneumatic tires for smoother rides and marginally higher top speed once firmware is tuned, provided braking upgrades (e.g., X-Tech) keep pace.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6743-L6767】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6769-L6787】

### Clone Scooter Compatibility & Upgrade Paths
- Doc Green/ESA owners confirmed Rita works in analog mode with the stock harness, but Bluetooth telemetry requires swapping to Xiaomi dashboards; full 12S performance typically means adopting the entire M365 controller, wiring loom, and dashboard to regain CFW support.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5198-L5284】
- Alibaba “KCQ” clones vary widely—Denis advised inspecting internals, confirming motor compatibility, or selling the copy to fund a genuine M365/M365 Pro when documentation is scarce.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5396-L5426】
- Denis’ repair BMS fits ESA-class clone battery bays without data lines, letting shops reuse analog frames or gradually migrate customers toward full Xiaomi electronics when telemetry is desired.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6336-L6356】

### Controller Cooling, Firmware & Charger Lessons (Mid-August 2020)
- Enthusiasts improved controller thermals by reapplying quality paste between MOSFETs and the aluminum housing, noting that Xiaomi enclosures already sit flush to the chassis once the OEM compound is replaced.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6001-L6033】
- Denis recommended LM2576HV/LM2596HV buck converters when powering 5 V accessories from scooter packs and reiterated that assembling a fresh battery shipment takes about three business days.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6077-L6084】
- 12S4P riders saw pack temps spike toward 50 °C when hammering hills after a fresh charge; easing firmware demand, letting packs rest after charging, or completing the 50.4 V charger mod kept temperatures in check.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6279-L6448】
- DIY charger mods should adjust the trimmer to 50.4 V—sloppy soldering or mistaking wood glue for silicone can cook the brick before it ever reaches Rita.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6541-L6546】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6775-L6781】

### Rita Configuration & Support Boundaries (Mid-August 2020)
- Community moderators reiterated Denis’ guidance for 13S builds: cut Rita’s pink jumper, raise CFW voltage limits (≈51 V for 12S, higher for 13S), and ignore legacy controller hacks that splice extra wires across cut traces.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6050-L6056】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6466-L6470】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6551-L6580】
- Denis drew a firm support boundary: miswired externals that blow Rita’s fuses or rely on non-common-port BMS boards are owner errors—send the adapter in for inspection only after verifying pack wiring.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6618-L6704】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6695-L6700】
- His M365 BMS Tool still needs BLE downgrades (072 for M365, 090 for Pro), and telemetry will flip between packs while charging because Rita reports whichever side leads by ~0.5 V.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6420-L6429】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6515-L6533】

### Bag Fitment & Hardware Adjustments
- Denis flagged two Wildman bag screws that can scuff his external packs; add soft padding over the shallow fasteners and mount packs with the power lead facing upward to protect the harness.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6360-L6361】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6463-L6465】
- Folding hooks that graze the bag can be trimmed or replaced with Monorim extender kits and X-Lock risers to restore clearance without sacrificing fold strength.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6450-L6512】

### Safety, Lighting & Visibility Ideas
- Community experiments showcased 3D-printed fender supports with integrated mudguards, wireless turn-signal pods, Lumos Matrix helmets, and plans for custom 12 V amber strobes—many riders prefer DIY strobes or wait for cheaper MIPS-equipped helmets over paying €240 for the official kit.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L6122-L6124】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7400-L7476】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L7462-L7472】

### Range Planning & Ride Etiquette Reminders
- A Rita-equipped M365 effectively multiplies range by ≈2.8× on base models and ≈2.1× on the Pro, making 24 km daily commutes feasible even for 130 kg riders who plan for higher-capacity packs and voltage matching before parallel connection.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L4695-L4750】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5320-L5335】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5941-L5942】
- Riders stressed defensive habits at 30–40 km/h—wide bike lanes, predictable signaling, and extra caution at driveways—arguing that responsible behavior matters more than rigid 20 km/h caps once scooters share roads with cars and cyclists.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L5553-L5576】

### Stem Hardware & Bag Clearance (Early September 2020)
- Plastic stem shims plus aftermarket Foldster X-Lock or Phoenix clamps remained the go-to cure for loose steering columns, and riders cautioned that trimmed latch levers and padded Wildman bags prevent hardware from gouging external batteries inside the case.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9003-L9069】
- Hot-gluing the rear-light connector shields it from road spray after 10" conversions, though worn mudguard screws may still need shop help to extract.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9330-L9338】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9334-L9344】

### Battery Safety, Cells & DIY Resources
- Denis clarified that pairing two 6 S LiPos only yields a 12 S (~44.4 V) pack, insisted on adding a proper BMS, forbade charging it with the stock 10 S brick, and told inexperienced builders to avoid RC LiPos altogether due to fire risk—suggesting NKON-sourced 18650 cells instead.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9017-L9024】
- For safe value builds he recommended a 10s4p Samsung 35E pack with a common-port BMS and pointed novices toward Micah Toll tutorials plus Vruzend prototyping kits before attempting welded packs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9027-L9038】

### Common-Port BMS Upgrades & Supplier Quality
- Builders converting third-party batteries to Rita compatibility swapped in AliExpress common-port boards (40 A UART485 models with Bluetooth modules) so they could monitor and configure packs.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9076-L9084】
- When cheap packs lacked common ports, moderators steered riders toward Denis’ or MisterLithium’s assemblies and cited Laudation as one of the few Chinese suppliers that met its rated capacity, warning that sensational “60 000 mAh” listings are scams.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9091-L9100】

### Pack Construction Practices
- Denis and fellow builders debated fishpaper rings, agreeing they belong on positive terminals while negatives stay bare, noting that duplicating insulation on both sides adds labor without improving current handling.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9189-L9254】
- He removed the fragile thermal fuse from the green v3 repair BMS because customers kept bending it, stressing that the board otherwise remains unchanged even though it can no longer interrupt charge/discharge during a fire.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9464-L9483】
- Denis also confirmed that custom 12s4p packs use wide nickel for power paths and narrow strips for balance leads, whereas his production batteries ship as 12s3p modules sized for the Wildman bag.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10456-L10463】

### Charging & Storage Guidance
- External packs tolerate up to 10 A when charged directly, but Denis still caps the scooter’s charge port at 2 A (3 A bricks can stress the OEM BMS) and recommends buying a dedicated high-current charger if faster top-ups are required.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9451-L9455】
- Rita always tops the internal battery first when charging through the scooter port; Denis planned an XT30-to-Xiaomi charger adapter so riders can easily charge externals separately in the meantime.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9918-L9927】
- Long-term storage should leave packs around 3.7 V per cell and in warm spaces—cold garages age cells faster even if the scooter itself is indoors.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9892-L9903】

### Rita Roadmap & Telemetry Limits
- Denis reiterated that Rita omits a data line to keep wiring simple despite requests for thicker cables and higher fuses; he instead promised next-generation batteries with smart BLE BMS boards by summer 2021.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9954-L9960】
- Because of that design choice, M365 Tools cannot show external battery capacity—riders must match voltages and rely on BMS apps, and the scooter will display whichever pack sits higher.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10476-L10490】
- Anyone encountering repair-BMS error 21 should re-seat the white–yellow–green data ribbon before assuming the board failed.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9904-L9912】

### Kit Compatibility & Display Behaviour
- Denis confirmed the Xiaomi 1S Range Boost (10 S) kit is plug-and-play without firmware flashing, whereas the 12 S Range+Speed kit demands a paid XiaFlasher unlock; scooters only report accurate state-of-charge when both packs are 10 S because 12 S externals hold the gauge at 100 % until they drop to ~30 %.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9502-L9536】
- New 12 S installations should expect ≈51 V full-charge readings and zero-watt telemetry in M365 Tools—Rita’s current-sense design makes that behaviour normal.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9556-L9564】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10103-L10116】
- Denis also reminded speed seekers that motors overheat before quality batteries do, so hammering a low-state-of-charge pack with extra current is a recipe for fried drivetrains.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9850-L9852】

### Tuning, Thermal Management & Suspension Noise
- Riders were urged to wait for external packs to reach 50–51 V before riding, raise recuperation-disable voltage to 4.150 V, and increase power-constant values (e.g., 33 000–40 000) if controllers run hot—lower numbers hit harder but drive up heat on 12 S builds.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10107-L10188】
- Lithium grease borrowed from bicycle maintenance quiets Monorim suspension pivots and keeps water out better than light oils or dry lubricants.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10154-L10163】
- Voltage upgrades can expose thermal limits—several riders saw dramatic heat spikes after installing Rita, prompting reminders to dial back Sport-mode amps and monitor motors after firmware tweaks.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10090-L10098】

### Tire & Motor Notes
- 10" pneumatic swaps still earn praise for smoothing bumps, yet some members reverted to 8.5" rubber with Monorim V2 to avoid S-shaped wobbles seen on certain XuanCheng 10" casings and to regain sharper steering; heavier riders noted extra bouncing on imperfect roads.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9567-L9590】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10492-L10497】
- Ninebot Max experimenters felt the original "Gen1/type 6" motor pulled harder, while the newer "Gen2/type 9" winding should run cooler and last longer even if peak performance is slightly lower.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9687-L9695】

### Logistics & Support Updates (Early September 2020)
- Denis’ early-September queue promised dispatches on 8 and 14 September around a short holiday, quoted roughly €207 shipped for a 12 S battery to the UK, and confirmed Serbia orders now leave via Polish Post with standard Visa payments accepted.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9802-L9829】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9861-L9867】
- Batteries remained EU-only because of dangerous-goods rules—US buyers must self-source packs, and even Israeli customers were redirected to third-party builders while land transport handled EU deliveries.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9908-L9915】【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10214-L10219】
- London riders could purchase Denis’ hardware locally through reseller Kvarkas instead of importing directly.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9835-L9837】

### Tools, Repairs & Warranty Handling
- Opening factory battery cases still demands brute force—Denis half-joked about “hammering” packs free and shared that BMS wiring photos already live in the chat media archive for reference.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9601-L9619】
- Community guides documented ST-Link recovery for bricked 1S/Pro2 dashboards, with members offering spare programmers while Denis reminded buyers the tool is inexpensive and widely stocked locally.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L10207-L10255】
- After one missed balancing-strip solder joint, Denis reaffirmed that every Rita ships tested, his limited BMS warranty excludes user-damaged boards, and he declines to sell through buyer-biased platforms like PayPal or Amazon.【F:data/E-scooter upgrade workshop by denis yurev/text_slices/all.part01.txt†L9634-L9657】

## Follow-Ups
- Resume extraction at line 10501 (mid-September 2020) to capture evolving 13S experiments, autumn logistics planning, and accessory build-outs following the dashboard-locking discussions.
