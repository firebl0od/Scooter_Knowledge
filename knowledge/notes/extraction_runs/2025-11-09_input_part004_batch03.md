- **Source file:** `knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md`
- **Coverage:** Lines 201–300 (Batch 3) – paused before line 301 for the next increment.
- **Key additions:**
  - Captured the budget-friendly dual Makerbase 75100 CAN recipe, direct hall/ebrake wiring limits, keyed Ubox ignition retrofit, duty-cycle jitter mitigations, and traction-control heat strain for Little FOCer hardware in the high-power reliability and Spintend integration guides.【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/high-power-vesc-scooter-reliability-guide.md†L8-L62】【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/spintend-ubox-integration-handbook.md†L35-L43】
  - Expanded motor and thermal playbooks with 4.5 ml ferrofluid injection tactics, AC milliohm metering, efficiency penalties above 330 A battery, high-Kv overheating cautions, airflow-first cooling experiments, and upgraded harness/temperature-sensing guidance for Blade/Xiaomi hubs.【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/motor_cooling_and_thermal_management.md†L32-L53】
  - Logged smart-charging and pack planning notes: refurb charger leakage risks, LLT/JBD selection for 4 S boosters, BMS bypass failures on Xiaomi parallels, field-weakening current budgeting, and BAK 2.5 Ah wiring math across the high-power, field-weakening, and DIY battery guides.【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/high-power-vesc-scooter-reliability-guide.md†L24-L118】【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/field-weakening-playbook.md†L33-L60】【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/diy-battery-sourcing-and-welding.md†L13-L46】
  - Documented accessory and dashboard insights: SmartDisplay UART CRC checks and €500 pricing context, VSETT divider requirements, Izuna’s 6.05 ADC dash branch, Kaabo NFC display compatibility, and low-cost BLE bridge options in the ADC, SmartDisplay, and accessory integration guides.【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/vesc-adc-accessory-integration.md†L6-L94】【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/smartdisplay-integration-guide.md†L38-L54】【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/vesc-accessory-power-and-display-integration.md†L35-L44】
  - Updated chassis-specific briefs with G30 deck measurements, 20 S 5 P packaging headroom, Ninebot hub thermal ceilings, Kotto brake prep, regen-only braking warnings, and Kaabo/NFC cockpit swaps for broader VESC conversions.【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/ninebot-g30-vesc-conversion-playbook.md†L12-L52】【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/xiaomi_tire_brake_upgrade_notes.md†L33-L43】【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/vesc-accessory-power-and-display-integration.md†L35-L38】
  - Logged market signals: shun the giant Kelly clones, note Ubox dual failure envelopes, Mihail’s hardened 75100 derivative, the CL500/CL700/CL1000 roadmap, controller QC watchlists, and Rage Mechanics’ 30 kW hub plans in the 2025 controller snapshot.【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/high-voltage-vesc-controller-market-2025.md†L19-L120】
- **Next step:** Resume at line 301 in `input_part004_review.md`, continuing through late-April/early-May firmware debates, braking hardware experiments, and ADC/telemetry follow-ups.
