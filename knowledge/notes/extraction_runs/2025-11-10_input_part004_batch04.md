- **Source file:** `knowledge/notes/input_part004_review.md`
- **Coverage:** Lines 301–400 (Batch 4) – paused before line 401 for the next increment.
- **Key additions:**
  - Hardened the high-power reliability guide with Makerbase 75100 Pro caveats, Little FOCer boot-failure notes, BMS cutoff discipline, field-weakening warnings for bypassed packs, and charger wake procedures for Happy boards.【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/high-power-vesc-scooter-reliability-guide.md†L10-L48】
  - Extended the field-weakening playbook to stress duty-triggered engagement, commuter FW ceilings, and longer release ramps that cure Raiden throttle hang-ups.【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/field-weakening-playbook.md†L3-L29】
  - Documented pack-building guardrails—JK vs. Daly BMS picks, ANT precharge limits, proper insulation stacks, high-watt soldering practices, adjustable-charger trim points, and LiPo supervision—in the DIY sourcing manual.【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/diy-battery-sourcing-and-welding.md†L12-L66】
  - Captured cooling and chassis takeaways including ferrofluid vs. grease trade-offs, hub rewiring techniques, Maike hub current needs, SmartDisplay-equipped Mantis builds, and Ninebot F-series stem inspections.【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/motor_cooling_and_thermal_management.md†L29-L56】
  - Updated the ADC integration playbook with Makerbase GH headers, reed-switch pull-ups, PAS filtering, regen-throttle strategies, cruise-control cautions, and ADC V2 diagnostic checklists.【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/vesc-adc-accessory-integration.md†L23-L76】
- **Next step:** Resume at line 401 in `input_part004_review.md`, covering the remaining mid-2023 firmware debates, wiring experiments, and charger diagnostics.
