- **Coverage:** Lines 101–200 (Batch 4–6 highlights, stopping before line 201).
- **Key additions:**
  - Expanded the Ubox handbook with launch comparisons against Zero 11X controllers and refreshed ADC guidance for hall-based brake levers.
  - Added demagnetisation guardrails, 21700 sourcing notes, parallel-pack wiring steps, and Ninebot deck capacity benchmarks to the processed guides.
  - Documented SmartDisplay speed-mode plans plus acceleration logging and range-extender practices for future touring builds.
- **Next step:** Resume at line 301 on the next extraction pass.

## Follow-up Pass – Lines 201–300

- Logged SmartDisplay updates (transparent BLE bridge, resin enclosure finishing, CAN “police mode” prototypes, deck-module production) and pushed the guidance into the SmartDisplay and Spintend handbooks.
- Captured brake/throttle compatibility intel—Magura SKU mapping, Boosted Rev voltage ranges, MiniMotors throttle clamps, Ninebot hall transplants, and shielded harness tricks—updating the ADC integration guide and Ninebot conversion notes.
- Expanded battery architecture coverage with PETG/kraftplex fixture tips, 15S10P split packs, 21700 sourcing math, Daly/JK smart BMS sizing, pre-soldered AS150 harnesses, and Mirono’s 13S5P Daly build for G30 decks.
- Recorded regen guardrails (−30 A/−80 A baselines, 2.55 kW heat spikes), CAN power-up precautions, Spintend single-core cooling limits, and delta-rewind current demands across the high-power reliability, Xiaomi checklist, and controller market snapshots.
- Added EU logistics changes (AliExpress IOSS VAT shift) and the community push for an integrated Spintend BMS to the Ubox handbook for procurement awareness.

## Follow-up Pass – Lines 301–400

- Documented Artem’s motor-current sizing heuristic, small-hub thermal data, regen-induced heating, and field-weakening guardrails across the high-power reliability and thermal-management guides.
- Captured AWD battery planning, Mirono’s 13S5P limits, LiFePO₄ freight realities, kraftplex/fibre pack construction tricks, and Daly reset workflows in the 2025 battery architecture and parallel-pack regen manuals.
- Expanded ADC integration coverage with 5 V hall clamping advice, per-lever channel requirements, and SmartDisplay horn warnings alongside updated Ubox current benchmarks.
- Enriched diagnostic and Ninebot conversion playbooks with magnet-count logging discipline, xmatic fault-capture reminders, AWG10 harness upgrades, plexiglass deck precautions, and hall-orientation repair steps.
- Flagged scam Spintend storefronts and reinforced warranty vetting inside the high-voltage controller market snapshot.

## Follow-up Pass – Lines 401–500

- Logged the lighting-power debates (relay 15–16 W beams, fuse pack-fed headlights, avoid tapping throttle 5 V) and updated accessory guides with the missing Spintend single 12 V warning.
- Captured Wheelway QC issues, warm-motor hall detection fixes, Trampa hall reboots, and Blade 10 hub dimensions so diagnostic and conversion manuals call out bench testing before sealing hubs.
- Added regen budgeting math (battery regen ≤ pack Ah, controller regen +15 A), Flipsky single thermal data, Rage Mechanics 10 kW motor envelope, and commuter fast-charge limits across reliability and battery architecture docs.
- Documented GX16 charge-port limits, nickel cross-section math, honeycomb cage requirements, and courier connector reinforcement inside the 2025 battery architecture/builder sourcing guides.
- Summarised SmartController stealth integrations, QS-S4 harness reuse, and SmartDisplay ecosystem expectations for builders retaining OEM dashboards.
- **Next step:** Resume at line 501 to keep backfilling Batch 17+ before returning to the late-October rotor thread beyond line 23001.

## Follow-up Pass – Lines 501–600

- Captured the horn/alarm debate by logging how riders hardwire GREATZT QSI-4840 siren boards and compact cycling horns to the Ubox horn output for 120–125 dB alerts plus a “polite” channel, then pushed the wiring preferences into the accessory-power and Ubox integration guides.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L526-L527】【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/vesc-accessory-power-and-display-integration.md†L53-L59】【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/spintend-ubox-integration-handbook.md†L102-L105】

- Logged the pass in the review and extraction tracker so the next session can advance from line 601 toward the remaining Batch 17 chatter.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L520-L527】【F:knowledge/notes/extraction_log.md†L1-L40】
- **Next step:** Resume at line 601 of the review to continue Batch 17 backfill before tackling the late-October rotor machining thread beyond line 23001.

## Follow-up Pass – Lines 601–700

- Recorded why 20 S pack upgrades raise risk—higher-voltage MOSFET Rds(on), longer enclosures, and insulation demands—before capturing EU builders’ scramble for 220 mm shrink and multi-strip bussing guidance inside the 2025 pack architecture playbook.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L601-L602】【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/diy-battery-supply-and-pack-architecture-2025.md†L18-L25】【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/diy-battery-supply-and-pack-architecture-2025.md†L115-L118】
- Documented connector, cooling, and braking guardrails—migrating XT90 builds to AS150U plugs, insisting on direct-to-deck controller mounts, and warning against regen-only stops—within the high-power reliability and thermal guides.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L610-L617】【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/high-power-vesc-scooter-reliability-guide.md†L33-L40】【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/high-power-vesc-scooter-reliability-guide.md†L87-L95】【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/motor_cooling_and_thermal_management.md†L21-L27】

## Follow-up Pass – Lines 701–800

- Added the Batch 20 cooling reminder to the reliability guide so Vsett dual-Ubox swaps include deck repasting even when the battery must come out, and logged how Face de Pin Sucé’s 134 km/h platform is scaling toward 140 km/h with 21 S 11 P packs and 6.5 kg hubs.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L701-L744】【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/high-power-vesc-scooter-reliability-guide.md†L24-L41】【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/high-power-vesc-scooter-reliability-guide.md†L85-L93】
- Hardened accessory/ADC coverage by warning builders to reseat the Spintend adapter’s 5 V/3.3 V selectors before bypass tests, documenting the DS harness backfeed logic, and noting the onboard 12 V rail’s suitability for low-current wireless relays.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L707-L741】【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/vesc-adc-accessory-integration.md†L170-L175】【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/vesc-accessory-power-and-display-integration.md†L61-L73】
- Captured charger/BMS insights by flagging constant-current travel bricks that never taper, recording Artem’s 600 mA active-balancing thresholds, and logging how riders fall back to 8–20 S ANT boards when the 7–16 S stock dries up.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L716-L747】【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/diy-battery-supply-and-pack-architecture-2025.md†L210-L220】【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/smart-bms-integration-handbook.md†L44-L52】【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/smart-bms-integration-handbook.md†L24-L31】
- Updated diagnostics and controller market notes with the phase-current graph workflow for spotting blown MOSFETs, field-weakening bench data, production tweaks on Spintend singles, Flipsky 75/200 cautions, and the 200 A VESC prototype now in development.【F:knowledge/notes/input_part000_review.md†L724-L733】【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/scooter_diagnostic_toolkit.md†L33-L45】【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/field-weakening-playbook.md†L8-L20】【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/spintend-ubox-integration-handbook.md†L24-L35】【F:knowledge/processed/themes/guides/high-voltage-vesc-controller-market-2025.md†L11-L23】
- **Next step:** Resume at review line 801 / source line 23301 to capture the customs/VAT follow-ups and extended sourcing notes queued after Batch 20.

## Follow-up Pass – Lines 22901–23000

- Logged the rotor spacer debate and ported the takeaway—machine a single-piece steel ring, not stacked washers, when offsetting tall brake adapters—into the Monorim hardware manual.
- Captured the hub-axle circlip reminder so the thermal-management guide now calls out why omitting the retainer lets the stator walk and chew bearings.
- Recorded the batch in the processed guides to set up future machining templates and motor teardown checklists for the remaining late-October chat.
- **Next step:** After backfilling the earlier batches, pick the thread back up at line 23001 to capture the remaining rotor machining and motor assembly notes.
