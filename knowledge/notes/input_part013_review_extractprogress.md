## 2025-10-19 (Pass 10)
- Attempted to cover lines 901–1000 of `input_part013_review.md`, but the notebook currently ends at line 871 so there was no new source text beyond the prior pass.
- Re-verified the closing Batch 16 highlights and logged the remaining actionable insight (CYD-based SimpleVescDisplay prototype) into the SmartDisplay integration guide.
- Next pass: blocked until additional notes are appended beyond line 871.
