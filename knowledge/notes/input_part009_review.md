## Key Findings

### Lighting & Control Wiring
- Tronic 250 aux 5 V rail keeps a 0.6 W taillight permanently on; moving the light to the connector beside the CAN bus only powers it while the controller is awake, otherwise add a self-latching switch for manual control.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L41-L78】
- The VESC ADC lighting harness uses high-side switching: brake output sources battery positive while ground is shared with the headlight, so combine functions with diodes or resistors and wire anodes to the function pins, cathodes to ground as noted in the updated diagram.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L46-L96】
- Xiaomi/Ninebot builders confirmed that an ADC expander can coexist with the stock dashboard by wiring the ADC module to ADC1/ADC2 and the dash to RX/TX, keeping cruise-control experiments possible without extra buttons.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L1253-L1255】
- The Spintend ADC accessory’s built-in 12 V rail only sources about 3 A, so dual 12 V headlights need a dedicated buck converter or relay harness instead of pulling both beams from the board directly.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L14989-L15037】

### Battery Building Insights
- Zero 10X pack builders layer thin epoxy sheets between the balance harness and copper busbars when holders won’t fit; epoxy boards keep insulation while staying slimmer than plexiglass spacers.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L17151-L17170】
- Mixing grey and purple LG M26 cells is acceptable here because every parallel group was binned to the same internal resistance; consistency matters more than colorways.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L32-L37】
- GABE confirmed leaded solder is still reaching builders via AliExpress shipments, giving his shop the consumables needed to finish a 13S8P e-bike pack despite customs scrutiny.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L110-L111】
- Molicel P42A packs show little benefit for scooters limited to ~120 A battery draw; 50H motors on 20 S without ferrofluid saturate around 60 A battery current, so cheaper cells may suffice.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L48-L49】
- Custom ASA‑CF cell holders require a heated build chamber to avoid warping, but the result is extremely rigid; expect filament costs near €50 per 750 g—roughly double standard ASA.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L607-L615】
- Builders caution that XT90S anti-spark connectors fail quickly under scooter duty; QS8s are the preferred drop-in upgrade for higher reliability.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L627-L628】
- Running range-extender packs with their own BMS in parallel works if the packs share voltage, but a tripped BMS can dump the full load on the others and instantly overstress them—plan for coordinated limits and protection.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L470-L476】
- Heavy 17 S builds reported that VESC electrical braking respects the 71.4 V full-charge voltage, so regen at 72 V setpoints stays within controller limits.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L1015-L1020】
- Rebuilt honeycomb packs benefitted from silicone spacers plus fishpaper or Kapton between series rows to preserve insulation while hot-gluing parallel groups, especially when wraps need replacing.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L1354-L1383】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L1946-L1953】
- Using twin steel strips over nickel is acceptable for ~8 A per cell in LG M26 builds, but ensure reinforcement and plan for ~10–11 kW limits on 17P layouts.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L1044-L1062】
- Active balancing boards can equalize large packs in about an hour, whereas relying on the JBD BMS’s onboard balancing would take days—handy when finishing high-capacity assemblies.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L1904-L1905】
- AYO nearly ordered 0.01 mm copper for his 22S11P P45B build before the group reminded him that busbars need 0.1 mm sheet; the thinner foil is craft-stock that tears under welding current.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L8020-L8036】
- PuneDir’s friend drained a JK-managed pack to 57 V and lost BMS comms, and GABE confirmed leaving cells near 2.5 V for days kills them—charge range-extender packs well before hard cutoffs to avoid permanent damage.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9180-L9203】
- Copper strip shaping matters on heavy packs: sharpened tabs near the positive terminal can slice insulation under a 14 kg load, so builders now chamfer nickel/copper busbars around the can top before shrinking everything down.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L11022-L11042】
- Several pack makers reiterated that tight-tolerance 3D-printed holders dramatically improve spacing and heat paths versus hot glue alone; PETG can work, but ASA/ABS handles flex and parked-car temperatures better, and it may be worth printing in higher-temp filament if the pack is long.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L11059-L11109】
- Double-layer “makaron” heat-shrink sleeves are being used in place of fishpaper between rows; veterans note it survives lighter abuse but still prefer fishpaper for series barriers because shrink alone scuffs faster.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L11199-L11220】
- Builders warned that leaving smart-BMS apps online invites tampering—JBD’s cloud portal can expose packs to remote limit tweaks, and ANT’s Android app hardcodes the monitor password so changing it throws a connection error; keep packs offline or stick with the default credentials if you need remote checks.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L14343-L14350】
- Squeezing 20 S 6 P 21700 bricks into a G30 chassis took a 36 mm deck extender and roughly 1 mm of grinding around the 6 mm-tall rail opening; without machining the lip, the pack and twin MP2 controllers won’t drop in cleanly.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L14702-L14735】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L14814-L14825】
- JK’s app-controlled BMS lets riders disable the discharge MOSFET to cut power and keep a parked scooter from waking up, offering a quick anti-theft toggle once the pack is topped off.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L17684-L17699】
- Compact 10 S builds drawing 30–45 A per cell still lean on smart boards such as JK or JBD 100 A units (with ANT as a backup) despite the tight packaging, prioritizing dependable protection and telemetry.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18225-L18241】
- When deconstructing welded packs, veterans prefer flush cutters to lift nickel tabs without grinding off the plating; stubborn specks can stay in place because new strip welds cleanly over the remnant once the surface is flattened.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18829-L18849】
- Adhesive-lined “marine” heat-shrink grips bullet connectors far better than thin sleeves that slide off under load, making it a go-to for battery leads if you don’t mind the glue.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18894-L18900】
- The group pegs EVE 40PL cells at roughly 45–70 A continuous despite 100 A marketing claims, and early stress tests show about 60 % capacity remaining after 300 cycles at 30 A—great for torque bursts, but expect shorter life than Molicel P42As run at similar rates.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L19531-L19588】
- 🇪🇸AYO#74 secures rebuilt modules by tacking the outer cells with hot silicone and cinching the stack with glass filament tape so vibration can’t fret the wraps—a lightweight alternative when custom holders don’t fit.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L19902-L19907】

### High-Speed Zero 10X & Controller Tuning
- Zero 10X builder “Shlomozero10” is pushing dual 84100HPs on a 16 S pack with 60 A field weakening per controller to touch ~62 mph (≈100 km/h) at a 60 kg rider weight; the 1200 W stock hub and frame are at their limit—motors run ~4.5 kW and heat saturates after an hour—so high-speed riders need aggressive temperature monitoring and frame inspections before chasing 140 km/h claims.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20578-L20591】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21120-L21134】
- PuneDir’s 20 S tune crossed the 100 km/h mark by holding battery current near 55 A per controller, 120 A phase, and dialing field weakening down to 30 A each side with BEMF decoupling—showing a saner baseline for dual-84100 builds than the 60 A FW experiments others are running.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20861-L20895】
- Paolo reminds Zero 10X owners that 11″ hubs require 145 mm fork spacing (versus the stock 125 mm); without longer swingarms or widened dropouts you’re limited to ~65 H, 10″ stators, so plan axle swaps before buying customs-market 11″ motors.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21169-L21180】
- 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁 keeps Hope Tech 3 V4 levers safe by adding a waterproof 2-pin hydraulic brake sensor (AliExpress SKU linked) that he now uses on most builds lacking cutoff switches, and the same part has proven a budget hall alternative for Magura/Nutt upgrades once you dial the magnet gap.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L101-L108】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21186-L21187】
- NetworkDir cautioned a Flipsky 75200 Pro V2 rider that 110 A phase on a “1000 W” hub while drawing only 25 A battery current will chatter; switching the observer to Mxlemming-without-Ortega and trimming phase current toward 80 A smooths starts without sacrificing top speed.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21199-L21208】
- PuneDir’s latest chain build is running a 72T rear and 9T front sprocket—an “amazing combo” he expects to complete within a week—so grab measurements once shakedowns confirm the gearing delta.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L186-L191】

### Enclosures & Packaging
- Mounting VESCs on top of the G30 battery stack traps heat because of the silicone isolation pad; clamping controllers to the deck sides or belly keeps them in direct contact with aluminum for better cooling.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L14891-L14894】
- PuneDir has been welding custom steel controller/battery boxes so hard crashes don’t shred housings—a reminder that temporary sheet enclosures should eventually give way to rigid metalwork or pro-fab cases.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15261-L15271】

### Cooling & Packaging Concepts
- Jan’s ducting approach routes controller heat into the rear wheel well: shape the mudguard into a tunnel with fins aligned radially to the tire, add rubber skirts to tighten the seal, and let the spinning wheel pull air through—no auxiliary fans needed while moving.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15799-L15827】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15833-L15845】

### Scooter Maintenance & Safety
- Zero 10X owners reported the rear shock is roughly 165 mm but the stock front only 135–137 mm; swapping to ~145 mm front units improves trail and makes the chassis less prone to cracking the neck under hard riding, whereas the short factory shocks feel undersprung for MTB-style use.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18509-L18527】
- A brand-new Zero 10X rear tire ballooned into the suspension after only 7 km; extending the shock eyelet restored clearance, and pack temps stayed near 35 °C—double-check fresh tire installs for rubbing under load.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18059-L18085】
- Zero’s neck and axle castings keep cracking around the factory lightening holes, so high-power builders are migrating to Vsett or SNSC/G30 frames instead of pouring parts into the Zero chassis.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18154-L18170】
- Kukirin G4 wobble complaints trace back to deformed stock tubeless tires and a front-shock pivot bolt that can shear; plan on replacing the tires, inspecting that bolt, and adding a proper fork or damper before chasing higher speeds since the chassis geometry itself is marginal past ~60 km/h.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15132-L15198】
- Several owners also noticed the wheel rocking inside the fork even when fasteners are tight, so expect to tear down the axle stack and add shims or bushings if you want the steering to stay stable long term.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15201-L15208】
- After a minor crash, another G4 rider found the scooter unstable above ~60 km/h until he tightened the steering-head screw Kukirin hides at the front bearing; he also confirmed the frame is spacious but the stock single motor needs ~8 kW to touch 90 km/h and overheats quickly on that tune.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L16251-L16308】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L16340-L16360】

### Tires & Wheels
- Builders chasing 13″ rubber on 7″ rims say options are limited to CST Dualtron X tires; PMT’s minibike lineup outperforms most car brands but doesn’t yet cover that rim, so custom LY rims or larger-wheel conversions are needed for premium compounds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18643-L18659】

### Brake Setup & Fluids
- Magura calipers hold up better with higher-temp fluids such as Bionol plus upgraded rotors, whereas the stock oil and discs boil easily; riders running DOT-based Hope brakes report similar reliability once tuned for 100 km/h builds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L17921-L17925】

### Quality Control Watch-outs
- Multiple members documented a €270 store-built pack with unsecured nickel, dented cells, and “repairs” that relied on electrical tape; the vendor refused refunds and suggested the buyer fund new cells despite the safety hazards.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L315-L370】

### Market & Vendor Alerts
- SlackPEV’s site briefly lapsed and its Turkish distributor allegedly took deposits without delivering scooters, so buyers are steering clear or insisting on escrow for boutique orders.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18708-L18729】
- Paolo reiterated that Rion has been a scam for years—many customers waited three years or never received builds even after the ownership shuffle—while Weped’s service remains spotty despite premium pricing.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18739-L18747】
- Hands-on inspections of Slack scooters called out rough welds, weak fork/stem hardware, and pricing near €8,900 for what feels like a €4,000 chassis; Rage Mechanics only trusts the titanium frame with extensive reinforcement and won’t race it as delivered, ranking Weped Fold 3 as the only halfway-refined Korean frame and labeling the rest “trash.”【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L19386-L19454】

### Controller Setup & Troubleshooting
- VESC Tool doesn’t require a physical throttle—builders are driving scooters via the Balance app, UART remotes, or CAN clients—but that openness lets anyone nearby change settings, so lock Bluetooth access or power controllers down when not tuning.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18662-L18671】
- ABS over-current trips can be mitigated by raising the Max ABS Current in VESC Tool when the hardware and wiring allow it.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L193-L198】
- Keyboard control in VESC Tool must be explicitly enabled in the UI (right-side toggle) even after a successful motor wizard run—useful when pairing Ubox controllers with M365 dashboards.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L257-L294】
- For Flipsky 75200 V2 installs that heat motors during free-spin, disable the phase filter, rerun detection, switch to the `mxlemming` observer, and cap currents at ~120 A motor / 50–60 A battery with -5 A regen until the tune is stable.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L768-L783】
- Makerbase confirmed the 75/200 boards are built around Huayi HYG015N10NS1TA MOSFETs, so replacements should match those specs if you’re repairing blown phases.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L8321-L8333】
- When bench-testing a Spintend VESC on a DC PSU, disable regen and avoid free-spinning field-weakening, otherwise back-EMF can over-voltage the supply and pop it.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L1120-L1125】
- Small hub motors driven by Flipsky 75200s showed that aggressive field-weakening observers (`mxm` variants) deliver speed but have killed controllers; increasing system voltage or easing FW demand is safer than pushing tiny motors past their limits.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L1290-L1331】
- Sensorless VESC operation in FOC is viable but expect to push-start the wheel or invest time in HFI tuning to avoid squealing stalls.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L1713-L1721】
- Spintend 85150 controllers rely on 100 V-class components, yet reports show units failing at 20 S when high-kV motors, MTPA, and heavy field-weakening stack stress on the hardware—stay conservative on voltage boost strategies.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L1522-L1536】
- Paolo highlighted reliability gaps in unvetted MOSFETs (e.g., fake datasheets from JJmicro) and favors Huayi parts that hold 20 kW loads below 40 °C—verify switching parameters before adopting bargain FETs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L1541-L1555】
- Regen-only braking is still punishing on small hub motors: GABE’s 800 W setup hit 45 A of negative battery current and cooked cells until he added mechanical brakes and temperature monitoring.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L8094-L8114】
- Makerbase Lite owners saw core temps drop ~25 °C after swapping the factory 5 mm interface for 0.5 mm thermal pads and keeping the controller clamped directly to aluminum—thicker pads act as insulation instead of a heatsink bridge.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L8287-L8298】
- When editing ADC settings over CAN, always `Read` the active controller first; the VESC Tool can silently write the same ID to both units if you flip between tabs without reloading, which is how Pandalgns “lost” CAN comms on twin 84100HPs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L8961-L8973】
- Makerbase 84100HP owners confirmed that ~55 mΩ detection values on older 45 H Mantis hubs are normal—the low-kV wind keeps resistance high even when the controller is healthy.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L14021-L14036】
- A 250 W Xiaomi hub cooked itself when spun on 13 S with heavy field weakening; stepping back to the stock Xiaomi ESC highlights how little headroom those commuter motors have for over-voltage experiments.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L14042-L14044】
- NetworkDir reminded dual-VESC builders to enter wheel diameter, pole count, and gear ratio on both controllers so the secondary doesn’t report 15 km/h while the primary shows 100 km/h during bench tests.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L8197-L8203】
- Koxx also warned to unplug CAN jumpers when reassigning IDs; otherwise both controllers can take the same new address and leave you diagnosing “dead” transceivers that were just overwritten.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9068-L9071】
- PuneDir confirmed that using CAN still lets you tune front and rear currents independently—the VESC Tool doesn’t mirror limits when you adjust each node through the shared Bluetooth session.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9046-L9067】
- Plug the CAN harness in before you energize the controllers; booting them first left Shlomo’s pair invisible until he rewired the bus and matched IDs, whereas bridging throttles is only a last-resort fallback when CAN is down.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L14351-L14366】
- VESC faults clear automatically once the throttle is released—holding the trigger during a fault just stretches the shutdown window and keeps the scooter limp longer than necessary.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L14970-L14971】
- Xiaomi-class ESCs get flaky above 12 S: GABE’s 13 S build kept tripping until he rebuilt as a 12 S 6 P pack, trading voltage for reliability on daily-use commuters.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L14989-L14998】
- Running 35 A battery current for 30 km in 35 °C heat overheated a Gen 4 G30 hub that lacked motor and ESC temperature sensors—after the warning squeal, the group now treats thermal instrumentation as mandatory for high-phase tunes.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15009-L15026】
- Even with the battery unplugged, Ubox controllers can wake for a second off charged capacitors; wait for LEDs to die before probing so you don’t short energized rails during rewiring.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L19021-L19022】
- Splitting battery current across both motors beats running a single motor hot: PuneDir measured 20 A into one hub as slower than 10 A/10 A across the pair, so leave dual-drive builds linked unless a motor is down for service.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18575-L18576】
- Always de-energize accessories before probing: Noname shorted a Nucular u-light board because the new BMS was still awake, underscoring the need to depower packs before unplugging sense boards.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15284-L15290】
- Battery wattage is still calculated from instantaneous pack voltage × pack current; VESC Tool’s realtime display shows phase amps, so expect peak “watts” there to overshoot battery power unless you convert using pack readings.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9504-L9514】
- Riders dialing in budget dual setups noted that 84100HP controllers on a 14 S 4 P Samsung 50E pack (Janobike T10 motors) topped out near 56 km/h despite 120 A phase limits—pointing to battery sag rather than controller specs for missing top speed.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9746-L9760】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9765-L9775】
- Child-safe profiles work best through the VESC Tool “Profiles” tab: scaling Max Current to roughly 60 % let one parent cap a scooter at ~5 mph for training while keeping starts smooth.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10073-L10087】
- Spintend honored a dual Ubox 75100 failure (caps burst at 72 V, 150 A BMS, dual-motor build) by shipping replacements; their support also pushed VESC firmware/app 6.05 updates that fixed configuration resets and left the scooter running noticeably smoother.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9910-L9928】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10129-L10129】
- Long phase-lead runs can choke current: a VESC-bike on a Flipsky 75100 with ~2 m phase cables stuttered past 11 A phase, reinforcing the need for short, low-resistance wiring on geared hubs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10494-L10515】
- 3Shul traction control can shunt torque rearward—builders testing 22 S 33×2 LY hubs with 70 % field weakening hit ~126 km/h, while Kelly-driven 20 S builds with 60 H high-speed hubs saw 138 km/h GPS without FW; traction control was temporarily disabled to explore the limits.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10292-L10324】
- Jan reported 20 S 6 P packs with dual Ubox 85/250s and 33×2 motors reaching 136 km/h without field weakening, illustrating what fully discharged high-speed LY setups can deliver when the pack keeps up.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10625-L10627】
- Zero 10X hubs that overheat on modest 30 A battery / 70 A phase / 20 A FW tunes point to setup issues—regen adds heat, and one rider’s motor detection showed 172 mΩ instead of the normal ~40 mΩ, suggesting bad shunt calibration or wiring; rerun detection on known-good hardware (e.g., 84100) before drilling for cooling.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L11001-L11010】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L11223-L11262】
- Flipsky 75100 failures that keep blowing FETs even unloaded often trace back to damaged gate-drive circuitry—check the FET drivers and op-amps before throwing in another transistor set.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L11818-L11920】
- Makerbase 84100 components are still best kept at 20 S despite 100 V marketing; riders exploring 23 S packs were advised to stick to ≤20 S unless they accept the risk of running beyond the manufacturer’s comfort zone.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L12011-L12033】
- A single VESC cannot drive two motors at once—dual-motor builds still need one controller per hub plus CAN for coordination.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L12486-L12489】
- JPPL’s official VESC display ran out of RAM when Wi-Fi and Bluetooth were enabled together; leaving only one wireless interface active keeps the UI responsive.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L12510-L12513】
- Low-kV motors still fail to reach the 250 A phase limits advertised for single Ubox 85/150 installs, underscoring that the hardware cap is theoretical when the motor’s electrical parameters constrain current draw.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L12555-L12557】
- Denis Shelema logged that field weakening on his setup let battery current creep above the configured 60 A limit and the only stable fix was to reset and rerun the motor wizard, reapplying settings afterwards.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L12904-L12930】
- Makerbase’s 12 FET line seems happiest at ~180 A phase per controller (cool climates have seen 200 A), while Spintend’s 12 FET Ubox routinely handles 250–300 A when cooled; chasing the MOSFET’s 700 A datasheet number is fantasy unless you triple-phase that rating.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15383-L15455】
- Lisa’s latest Flipsky 75200 still popped the moment it was plugged in—even though the V2 hardware finally nails motor detection—reinforcing why many riders are pivoting to Ubox or Makerbase for 5–6 kW builds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15391-L15405】
- Finn traced motor oversaturation on a long-phase-cable build to ~2 m of lead between controller and hub, reinforcing the earlier advice to minimize phase-run length on high-power scooters.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L12968-L12970】
- NetworkDir recommends turning on traction control (or at least matching tire, pole, and gear values across CAN nodes) so slipping front wheels don’t inflate speed readings beyond GPS reality.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L13108-L13115】
- Paolo reminded high-power riders that sensorless front hubs can chatter around 10–15 km/h; soldering in hall sensors resolves the low-speed vibration on 33×2 70H motors.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L13508-L13516】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L13527-L13534】
- 3Shul CL350 V4 owners cleared ABS over-current faults by rerunning detection with a 500 µs timing step, switching from `mxlemming` to the Ortega observer, and dialing in the tune manually as in Vedder’s demos.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L17692-L17699】
- PuneDir’s Zero 10X runs cleanly with 120 A phase, 60 A battery per controller, about 15 A of field-weakening, and the `mxlemming` observer—more FW or a different observer just inflated the speed reading without usable thrust.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18275-L18305】

### Telemetry & Calibration
- Mantis owners running 10" hubs reported VESC Tool’s wheel-circumference value of 253–254 mm keeps the dashboard speed close to GPS—254 mm reads about 3–5 km/h high but is acceptable for quick benchmarking.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15504-L15522】

### Performance Benchmarks & Racing Notes
- Jan’s dual 85/250 G30 currently peaks around 21 kW on a 20 S 6 P P42A pack with a 550 A BMS; stepping up to Samsung 40PL cells would raise the limit to roughly 26–34 kW, but only if the wiring and controllers can tolerate 200–250 A battery draw.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L17045-L17053】
- Jan’s enclosed dual Spintend 85/250 build on a 20 S 6 P P42A pack is delivering ~20 kW and 136 km/h while keeping everything inside the G30 frame, proving how much headroom the chassis has once the deck is machined for clearance.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L14260-L14272】
- Face de Pin Sucé’s race team still caps out near 147 km/h on 20 S 8 P 40T packs with 70 H motors—about 25 kW—because beyond that the 11‑inch frames hit aero limits, resonate, and would need 40 kW+ plus major chassis work to flirt with 200 km/h claims.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L14905-L14949】
- Jan’s next commuter experiment is a 19 S 6 P low‑kV 65 H single-motor G30 targeting roughly 200 km of range without deck spacers, highlighting how far internal energy storage can stretch on optimized hub builds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15183-L15190】
- PuneDir’s Zero 10X GPS runs sit around 103 km/h today, and he’s planning a 25 kW setup to push 0–100 km/h toward 12 s—reminding riders that accurate GPS timing (Dragy, etc.) is the gold standard for bragging rights.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15472-L15499】

### Build Logs & Upgrade Plans
- Kukirin G4 builders continue to exploit the roomy frame: one is swapping to LY 70H hubs, designing adjustable dropouts, and feeding a 20 S 8 P Samsung 50S pack that can deliver ~360 A peak, though his Ubox 85150 will cap usable output below the battery’s ceiling.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L16520-L16560】
- A customer build proved the G4’s stock motor can hit 90 km/h on a Ubox 85150 and 20 S 8 P pack but demanded about 8 kW and “oven” temperatures, reinforcing why riders often budget for motor upgrades alongside controller swaps.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L16291-L16308】

### Spot Welders & Power Delivery
- Glitter 801D users saw LiPo-fed capacitor banks sag toward 5.7 V, with weld quality falling off unless they rotate packs or switch to low-ESR capacitor supplies.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L2001-L2013】
- Paolo cautioned that KWelds will still trip on over-current if the input bank is oversized or the cabling is wrong, so Glitter owners shouldn’t expect immunity just because they run capacitors.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L2015-L2018】
- Builders weighing upgrades highlighted why the 801H is the “buy once” choice: twenty transistors instead of five, stronger shunts/protection, and better welding pens for regions where returns are costly.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L2054-L2056】
- Follow-up chatter clarified limits—GABE flatly noted that a stock 801D cannot reliably weld 0.15 mm copper, so heavier sandwiches belong on the 801H plan.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L2959-L2960】

### Spot Welder Power Debates & Alternatives
- Paolo reiterated that 60 Ah car batteries only deliver ~750 A pulses and still trip KWeld overcurrent faults, urging builders to avoid lead-acid sources and instead size their cabling/connectors (QS8/EC8 with 25 mm² leads) for KWeld’s ~2000 A ceiling.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L5004-L5076】
- Cihan confirmed 80–100 Ah starter batteries sag under KWeld loads and, at best, feed roughly 1000 A if you keep them above 10 V—reinforcing why builders graduate to capacitor banks or LiPo sources for thick copper jobs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9011-L9012】
- The same thread recommends TIG with a low-cost timer board as a clean alternative that sidesteps cable heating losses when spot welders keep faulting, particularly for builders chasing thick copper sandwiches.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L5057-L5068】
- Later updates confirm Glitter 801D success only when pairing 0.1 mm copper with steel or iron caps; pure nickel sandwiches tear free even at full power, underscoring the need for higher-grade machines before attempting thicker copper stacks.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6203-L6239】

### Wiring & Materials Experiments
- Builders are testing thin-glass-fiber-insulated wire rated for 800 °C because its slim jacket may squeeze 6 mm² conductors into Lonnyo 65H 33×2 hubs; Jan cautions that the wiring job, not the cable sourcing, is the real bottleneck since rewinding each motor eats hours.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15852-L15879】
- Tristan’s math shows 6 mm² copper leads add roughly 0.000285 Ω, so at 150 A the wire dumps ~6.3 W while the XT90 connector likely becomes the hotter choke point—still monitor controller and connector temps despite the low conductor loss.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L16423-L16441】
- Refurbishing a Glitter 811H with fresh consumables restored consistent 0.25–0.30 mm copper welds, convincing Haku the platform can rival KWeld output once tips and cables are renewed.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L22014-L22016】

### Suspension, Tires & Mounting
- Riders comparing EXA shocks report that KKE dampers outperform EXA 388/291 units, with 60 kg riders advised to start around 650–850 lb springs (1000 lb if running twin shocks) and adjust upward only for firmer feel.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L5168-L5228】
- Tubeless tire swaps on 11–12 inch rims are easiest with ratchet straps or belts plus pry bars; small pumps can seat beads once the strap preloads the carcass, offering a portable alternative to shop compressors.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6281-L6333】
- Solid-tire installs on G30-class hubs go smoother if you heat the tire in boiling water (or a microwave) for roughly 10–15 minutes, brace the motor on the floor, lever it on with two tire irons, and finish with soapy water to help it seat evenly.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L8387-L8398】
- PuneDir’s 12-inch conversion on a Zero 10X highlights clearance challenges, while Paolo notes that true 11-inch motors often foul suspension springs unless spacers are reworked—keep motor diameter in mind before chasing larger rims.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6281-L6299】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6369-L6371】
- A fresh Zero 10X hub arrived with a warped rotor that scraped the caliper until the owner reworked the alignment—another reminder to inspect brake spacing anytime motors are swapped or rewired with thicker leads.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L17943-L17952】
- CEPP revived the JREV Speedfork project with redesigned brake brackets and 11-inch clearance plus teased G30 rear suspension kits, but Jan says the release violates his original IP—worth tracking in case legal drama halts availability.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9204-L9213】
- 80 H and 75 H LY hubs can squeeze into Thunder swingarms when you open the dropout to roughly 155 mm and add 5 mm spacers per side, though the rims are custom CNC parts to keep the wheel centered.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L11610-L11635】
- Rain race prep emphasized tire choice: Rage Mechanics swapped scooter slicks three times across wet qualifying and mixed-condition heats to stay competitive.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L11632-L11637】
- Bigger-diameter wheels still rule off-road—builders noted 21"/19" e-moto combos ride better than 10" scooter rims even with more suspension travel.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L11866-L11868】
- Stock Vsett rims remain tube-only; one rider logged four flats in under a year and confirmed tubeless conversions aren’t practical without changing wheels, making solid or heavy-duty tubes the realistic alternative.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L12170-L12200】
- Brake rotor slot direction matters: orient the cooling slots “leading” on the front, but flip a rear rotor if the slots face the wrong way after a wheel swap.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L12472-L12477】

### Frame & Chassis Alerts (lines 20000-21499)
- Multiple riders reiterated that aggressive wheelies still snap old Zero 10X stems; NetworkDir warned the 60-series neck and fork castings (lacking the “X” rib) are the failure points, so swap in the newer 70-series hardware or at least inspect for cracks before chasing high-speed runs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20036-L20043】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20505-L20518】
- Shlomozero10 noted his hyper Zero runs mixed 50H/50H motors and heavy tires, making lane changes sketchy above ~65 km/h; he also reminded others that helmet-mounted GoPros can destabilize steering at speed.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20578-L20599】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21252-L21257】
- Paolo confirmed that fitting 11-inch hubs up front requires widening Zero 10X dropouts to ~145 mm; the stock 125 mm fork only clears up to 65 H motors in 10-inch rims without aftermarket swingarms or axle spacers.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21169-L21180】

### Frame & Chassis Updates (lines 21976-22075)
- Nami owners occasionally graft Kaabo forks, but Yamal and Haku called the mod cosmetic and noted only 70 H hubs are confirmed to fit; 75 H clearance remains doubtful without further machining.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21996-L22002】
- Face de Pin Sucé prepped their race fleet for rain by fabricating a waterproof enclosure around the Nami’s C350 controller—enough that they were the only team still lapping Albaida once the showers started—and they now machine most replacement frame parts in-house to keep Thunder-family hinges alive under race abuse.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L22034-L22072】
- NetworkDir still rates the Dualtron Thunder 3 and Storm LTD frames as the weakest in the lineup thanks to folding-hinge flaws, preferring the older T1 chassis—Face de Pin Sucé now machines most replacement frame parts in-house to solve those weaknesses for race duty.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L22058-L22072】

### Controller, Firmware & Tuning Notes (lines 20000-21499)
- Noname’s Nucular experience highlighted ongoing firmware pains—buggy light-board updates can trap a scooter in reverse until another patch arrives—so expect downtime and be ready to bypass or reflash if you rely on that platform.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20280-L20285】
- Rotatooor cooked a MakerX M100 by leaving the phase limit at 70 A when the controller is rated for 40 A continuous/120 A peak, underscoring the need to reapply sane phase currents after motor detection on smaller ESCs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20376-L20390】
- Yamal continues to steer riders toward Spintend Ubox 85/150 units for mid-power builds, while the group reiterated longstanding Flipsky quality and licensing concerns—plan around Ubox stock or vetted alternatives before committing to a replacement.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20385-L20393】
- Jansblog’s telemetry puts the Ubox 85150 comfortably at 160 A phase, 120 A battery, and 25 A of field weakening with peak case temps around 42 °C in 15 °C ambient—use it as an upper bound for hard highway pulls before assuming more thermal headroom.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20452-L20452】
- PuneDir broke 100 km/h on his 20 S Zero using ~30 A of field weakening, 120 A phase and 55 A battery per controller; Shlomozero10 is still running 60 A FW per side but sees 50 H motors overheat within an hour, so NetworkDir advised dialing FW back, raising phase current, keeping ~35 kHz PWM and switching the observer to `mxlemming` for cleaner tracking on 84100/75100-class controllers.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20425-L20475】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20876-L20895】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21236-L21275】
- Alex’s ABS over-current warnings on VESC hardware disappeared after he raised the Max ABS Current ceiling in VESC Tool, highlighting that regen-heavy tunes may simply need a higher guardrail instead of hardware changes.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L194-L197】
- Lisa reminded riders that at top speed the controller’s phase and battery currents converge, and that poor motor detection on Flipsky hardware can worsen these issues—double-check detection pop-ups for resistance/inductance data before tuning limits.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21321-L21328】
- PuneDir still sees 90 km/h in traffic, prompting reminders that steering dampers and chassis geometry matter; NetworkDir emphasized chasing wobble fixes across frame design, suspension, and not just trail numbers.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20406-L20423】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21250-L21257】
- For playful builds, Raphaël demonstrated VESC 6.05’s Lisp app streaming: it can drive a hub motor as a “speaker,” but the process isn’t user-friendly and excites frame resonance quickly, so treat it as a novelty rather than a production feature.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21439-L21499】

### Battery & Powertrain Projects (lines 20000-21499)
- Haku is stacking 20 S 12 P P42A and 20 S 10 P 40T packs for a minibike, targeting ~90 Ah while still watching weight; he’d prefer Samsung 40PL cells for higher discharge but notes P42A/40T stay around 35 A continuous per cell.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20199-L20220】
- Yamal showed his X12 still running a 100 A battery feed while commanding 250 A on each motor, underscoring how fast dual setups tax cooling if enclosures aren’t upgraded.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L135-L138】
- PuneDir is sourcing a 30 S-capable BMS for a 20 S motorcycle conversion; NetworkDir suggested an ANT 30 S board or two cascaded JK 15 S units, highlighting the limited off-the-shelf options above 24 S.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20355-L20374】
- 🇪🇸AYO#74 shared fresh pack-building tactics: 0.1 mm copper sheet welds securely with a Glitter 801-series welder, four weld points per cell, and copper-over-nickel sandwiches hold fast once Kapton/barley paper isolates each series layer.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21376-L21405】
- The same build log flagged a control-cable mismatch when pairing a 30 S ANT BMS with a 22 S harness; double-check pin-outs before final assembly because the board reads voltages correctly even when the balance leads are offset.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21316-L21396】
- Cheap aftermarket frame bags may not support dense 20 S packs—Haku’s new bag sagged immediately, so he’s bracing it with straps/zip ties before test rides.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21426-L21437】
- Jan and Yamal debated cell choices for large packs: 40PL promises higher burst output, yet local availability and weight push some builders back to P42A/40T until the PL supply stabilizes.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20199-L20220】
- 🇪🇸AYO#74’s freshly commissioned 22 S 11 P P45B pack is running sensorless for now; he requested configuration help without cam or hall sensors, signalling the need for a shared detection template before first rides.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L22070-L22074】

### Battery & Powertrain Projects (lines 21976-22075)
- Haku scrapped his earlier stand-up Laotie extender, repurposed that module as an auxiliary, and is now welding a 240-cell main pack for the seated frame; the remaining tasks are cutting the folding-joint plates, welding the main ± leads, and routing the BMS before it can ride again.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21904-L21924】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21980-L21993】

### Controls, Brakes & Accessories (lines 20000-21499)
- For compact builds lacking e-brake levers, the crew recommended child-sized handles with built-in switches or thumb throttles repurposed as brake inputs; Wuxing’s 115PDD lever is a budget option that simply closes a loop when pulled.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20306-L20327】
- 🇪🇸AYO#74 vouched for a waterproof 3-pin thumb throttle with virtually no dead zone as a higher-quality alternative to stock Ninebot/VSETT units, and flagged the Spin-Y2 as fragile despite its integrated regen control.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20536-L20567】
- When sizing brake sensors, the group advised choosing levers with hall elements instead of simple switches (especially for kids’ hands) and, for hydraulic setups, adding magnetic cutoff sensors like the two-pin modules 🇪🇸AYO#74 uses on high-power scooters.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20536-L20556】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20928-L20934】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21186-L21187】
- Rim brakes quickly gouged paint on Haku’s 20 mph minibike build, so the crew suggested sourcing disc-ready wheels or fabricating caliper mounts rather than leaning on V-brakes beyond low-speed duty.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21004-L21007】
- Shlomozero10 currently rides his Zero without a front brake, relying on a Nutt 4-piston rear and regen; others urged moving to Magura or Shimano Saint-class calipers and quality pads before continuing highway pulls.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21214-L21232】
- Noname noticed the precharge resistor strip inside an anti-spark connector heating up after repeated plugs—inspect XT90S/QS8 shells for discoloration or replace fatigued units before they melt under high-current starts.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20442-L20448】

### Motor & Drivetrain Fitment (lines 20000-21499)
- Burn‑E owners confirmed the standard hub is a 17×4 inch 60 H motor (~1,500 W nominal), while Kaabo’s Wolf King GT runs 60 H 22×3 hubs; stepping to 11‑inch motors requires import workarounds and custom swingarms in many regions.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21268-L21279】
- NetworkDir reminded builders chasing more speed on mixed Zero/Mantis setups that matching PWM frequency (~30–35 kHz) and observer choice across controllers helps traction and thermal behavior when combining different hub generations.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20432-L20475】

### Zero 10X Frame & Conversion Updates
- Some regions still ship the Zero 10X as a single-motor scooter with a dummy front hub, so dual-conversion plans need to budget for a complete powered wheel, cabling, and controller pairing instead of assuming both motors arrive installed.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20600-L20610】
- FalconPEV’s 11″ swingarm kit gives the fork and rear end the extra length 11″ hubs require, but experienced riders still reinforce the steering assembly to curb cracking once the longer arms and high-power motors go on.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21642-L21663】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21754-L21755】

### Mini Moto & Pack Fabrication Updates
- Haku’s Peak G30 minibike build runs a 6 FET Spintend on stock G30 hubs limited to about 20 mph on 16 S; he plans a backpackable 20 S pack once he finds a stronger front brake, highlighting how kid-sized levers and V-brake hardware struggle above ~30 km/h.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20626-L20633】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20998-L21007】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21036-L21047】
- Folding copper busbars over high-capacity packs takes layered insulation—builders are sliding fiber board or 3D-printed T-spacers between positives and negatives before bending, then chamfering edges so the stack survives vibration without cutting wraps.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20705-L20714】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L11022-L11042】
- 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁 reconfirmed that 0.1 mm copper sheet welds cleanly while 0.25 mm needs near-maximum energy; once it’s tacked in place the sheet tears before the welds let go, so battery techs should pre-plan the weld sequence and expect minimal rework tolerance.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21376-L21405】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21966-L21970】
- Off-the-shelf frame bags sag badly under 20 S bricks; Haku’s pack now needs extra straps and zip ties until a stiffer mount is fabricated, reinforcing the need for verified carriers before recommending DIY minibike conversions.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21426-L21437】

### Ninebot G30 Extreme Packaging
- GABE is modeling a 20 S 12 P core for the G30 with double-stacked cells (~14.5 cm tall) and dual MP2 controllers mounted in a welded rear box; the plan keeps deck arches intact, parks the BMS vertically ahead of the brick, and relies on dual QS8 leads plus parallel 8 AWG cabling to move the current.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21900-L21939】

### Accessory Power Ideas
- Rather than lean on the ADC board’s light outputs, riders are splicing a dedicated buck converter from the main pack to power GPS speedos and other 5 V gear—just bench-test the module first because mislabeled units have cooked 6 V accessories in the past.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21797-L21820】

## Follow-Up Ideas
- Validate pack support hardware that can safely suspend 20 S battery bricks inside minibike frames so riders can recommend proven bags or brackets.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21426-L21437】
- Document observer/FW tuning recipes for mixed-motor scooters (e.g., Zero front + Mantis rear) that minimize overheating while preserving triple-digit GPS speeds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20432-L20475】
- Capture a parts list and fabrication guide for widening Zero 10X fork dropouts or swapping to newer 70-series castings so builders can support 65 H+ hubs without repeated stem failures.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20505-L20518】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21169-L21180】
- Build a Zero 10X single-to-dual conversion guide that covers dummy-hub removals, 11″ swingarm kits, and the stem clamps teams are adding to tie both fork nuts together.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20600-L20610】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21642-L21663】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21754-L21755】
- Write up the waterproof C350 enclosure, drain paths, and frame reinforcements Face de Pin’s crew used so other Thunder/Nami racers can copy their rain-ready prep without guesswork.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L22050-L22053】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L22066-L22072】
- Add an anti-spark health checklist that calls out precharge-resistor discoloration, connector resistance checks, and replacement intervals before the housings melt under repeated high-current use.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20442-L20448】
- Document the Glitter 811H consumable swap (tips, cables, contact pressure) that unlocked reliable 0.25–0.30 mm copper welds so builders know when refurbishing the welder beats replacing it.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L22015-L22017】
- Draft a packaging blueprint for the 20 S 12 P G30 concept—deck clearances, welded controller box, BMS placement, and QS8/8 AWG routing—so builders can sanity-check the layout before cutting metal.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21900-L21939】
- Capture the Laotie folding-joint weld workflow, main-lead routing, and BMS packaging steps so the 240-cell seated-frame build can become a repeatable template instead of a one-off experiment.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21904-L21924】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21980-L21993】
- Publish an accessory-power how-to that specs reliable buck converters, wiring paths, and validation steps before tying 5 V electronics into high-voltage packs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21797-L21820】

### Workshop Tools & Techniques
- A 1/4"-hex impact driver is handy for scooters if you use impact-rated sockets and throttle the trigger—keep it off split-rim bolts unless you’re just spinning them on, and never tap threads with an impact because the hammering will shatter the cutters.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15566-L15585】
- Step drills remain the cleanest way to enlarge round switch holes for power buttons and panel-mount XT60s, while oblong cuts still need a file or nibbler; once the hardware is in, tighten axle nuts with a hand ratchet instead of an impact so you can feel clamp load and avoid stripping threads.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L19023-L19038】

### Controller & Firmware Notes
- Xiaomi XESC controllers can run field-weakening up to ~20 S if hardware mods raise voltage sensing, but veterans warn that FW cutoffs can still brick Xiaomi and G30 ESCs—treat FW as optional speed boost, not daily tuning baseline.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L5231-L5274】
- Community feedback pegs Spintend minis at ~135 A phase from the factory; pushing 180–200 A plus FW has cracked hardware, so plan cable mods or bigger controllers for sustained power experiments.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6008-L6036】
- Windows users continue to report VESC Tool 6.05 launch failures even though the build runs on Ubuntu, suggesting a lingering installer or dependency issue worth documenting alongside the newly posted 6.05 binaries.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6354-L6356】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6483-L6490】
- Happy Giraffe outlined the safe upgrade path from VESC Tool 6.05 beta: export your configuration backup from the beta build, install the official 6.05 release, flash the matching firmware, then restore the backup so throttle and limit settings survive the transition.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10709-L10723】
- Paolo flagged ongoing quality risks with legacy Makerbase boards: the discontinued dual 100/100 struggled on firmware newer than 5.2 because the factory sourced second-hand (and sometimes fake) STM chips during the shortage, so even newer 84100 units earn side-eye until the supply chain is proven solid.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15886-L15919】

### Sensor & Display Updates
- Patrick fixed a -23 °C thermistor reading on his VESC by swapping in a 100 kΩ NTC and 1 kΩ PTC pair, confirming the stock scaling expects that combo.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6505-L6507】
- The factory Vsett display keeps working on firmware 6.05 builds—NetworkDir confirmed it on Ubox hardware—as long as you flash the GitHub LISP firmware and follow the wiring tutorial; it can share the ADC adapter harness if you still need light outputs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6920-L6920】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9655-L9697】
- Builders priced premium RTV/Trampa dashboards against a €17 ESP32 touch display after Happy Giraffe and James posted ready-to-flash Arduino code, making it realistic to print a custom case and add Wi‑Fi/Bluetooth telemetry without buying €100+ commercial screens.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9655-L9659】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10775-L10783】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10789-L10793】
- Budget dash option: the €20 Turkish ESP32 display works with Ubox hardware if you solder into RX/TX and flash the provided firmware, and community members are offering remote help plus printable cases for anyone uncomfortable with the upload tools.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L12468-L12480】
- Makerbase 84100HPs ship with an integrated Bluetooth radio—the external “antenna” is just the PCB feed—so you can pair and configure both CAN-linked controllers over a single module when it’s working properly.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L8974-L8999】
- Rewound hub projects are leaning on handheld Gauss meters to verify magnet strength after re-magnetizing stators, giving a quick sanity check before buttoning the motor back up.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L19004-L19009】
- Incorrect pole-count entries can exaggerate dashboard speed by nearly 40%—NetworkDir’s GT2RS read 165 km/h with a 30-pole setting even though GPS confirmed ~120 km/h on its 40-pole hubs—so match magnet counts before posting numbers.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L19199-L19203】
- Denis Shelema’s DIY Sunton ESP32-8048S043 dash brings a 4.3″ 800×480 capacitive touchscreen with GPS logging, configurable gauges/modes, Wi‑Fi firmware updates, handlebar buttons via GPIO, and onboard storage for odometer/settings data after custom firmware and enclosure work.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L12929-L12947】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L13089-L13092】

### Vsett 10+ Dual-VESC Conversion Lessons
- Yoann’s customer build expanded the stock pack to 20 S 8 P while retaining the NAMI BMS, then dropped in dual Spintend VESC Lite 100 V/100 A controllers to deliver smoother power without changing the scooter’s stock appearance.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6553-L6560】
- Lacking a native 12 V rail, he now uses VESC 5 V to trigger an Arduino relay that energizes a battery-fed 12 V converter, keeping lights and accessories off the delicate Ignite port fuse that has already blown twice in testing.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6603-L6608】
- Dual-hall throttle setups demanded manual tweaks to the throttle’s start voltage after calibration to keep brake and throttle inputs stable, so expect iterative tuning if you split controls across master/slave VESCs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6561-L6563】

### Wiring & Harness Tips
- Doubling up 12 AWG leads proved sufficient for ~80 A battery runs on GABE’s 8 P pack, suggesting parallel silicone leads are a workable compromise when routing space is tight.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6581-L6584】
- Two-meter throttle extensions haven’t shown noise problems for Ion when using quality silicone cable, so shielded loom is optional for most scooters.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L7164-L7185】
- Rewiring a JBD harness without shorting the identical white sense leads caused false zero readings until the missing parallels were re-tied to the same terminal—double-check the diagram before moving balance wires around mid-pack repair.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6669-L6686】
- Pandalgns discovered that older Android VESC Tool builds lock users into “limited” mode; reinstalling the free 6.05 release from vesc-project.com restored full configuration access and firmware updates.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6825-L6890】
- Shlomozero10 noted that Makerbase 84100HP controllers expect a normally-closed momentary switch, so sourcing handlebar ignitions requires NC hardware or a relay adapter.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L13398-L13404】
- For connectors and small components, LCSC ships genuine Amass XT60 panel mounts for about $0.35 each with ~€15 logistics, making it a cheaper alternative to AliExpress resellers when stocking harness parts.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L19703-L19712】

### Regen Brake Lighting Reality Check
- Riders relying on regen throttles confirmed that most VESCs—including Makerbase 75/200 variants—lack a native brake-light trigger, so you either dedicate an ADC board output or program a spare GPIO with external resistors/relays to drive 12 V lighting.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L7134-L7141】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L7741-L7754】

### Copper Welding & Materials Debates
- The group keeps steering newcomers toward KWeld kits (or Glitter 801H-class rigs) when they need reliable copper welds; Glitter 801D struggles beyond 0.1 mm copper while KWeld’s joule-controlled pulses manage 0.1–0.2 mm with good prep.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L7559-L7583】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L7631-L7645】
- Builders warned that 0.5 mm copper strip is overkill for spot welding, recommending wider 0.1–0.2 mm sheets or stacked layers instead of fighting thick stock that overheats pens and is difficult to cut cleanly.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L7589-L7643】
- Haku’s refreshed Glitter 811H setup is now fusing 0.25–0.30 mm copper cleanly after swapping consumables, suggesting the machine can rival KWeld outputs when the electrodes and cables are renewed—worth documenting for builders still facing customs bans on KWeld kits.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L22015-L22017】

### Adhesive & Insulation Lessons
- Hot-melt glue softens around 80–90 °C and doesn’t adhere well to cold cans, so Noname prefers it only for temporary tacking before switching to cell holders, fishpaper, or silicone that resists vibration in finished packs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L7754-L7760】

### Mechanical & Repair Tips
- Xiaomi frame owners debating oversize fasteners were advised to avoid 3.2 mm pilot holes for M4 taps—Arsenus reports that diameter risks thinning the frame bosses, so step up cautiously if you already stripped M3 hardware.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L7964-L7978】
- Rain intrusion still ruins wheel bearings when seals are absent; AYO recommends rubber-sealed units that tolerate 80–100 °C operating temperatures instead of leaving shielded bearings exposed.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L13324-L13332】
- Face de Pin’s race crew fully waterproofed their Thunder and Nami platforms for rainy track days, even machining custom C350 controller enclosures and fabricating their own frame components to keep electronics sealed without sacrificing serviceability.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L22050-L22053】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L22066-L22072】

### Controller Maintenance & Recovery
- Jeferson’s Flipsky 75100 remains stuck on a blue LED despite ST-Link attempts, underscoring the need for a documented unbrick workflow when SWD flashing fails on these boards.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L7995-L7995】
- Builders are potting Makerbase 84100s for rain duty by conformal-coating the boards and adding printed covers without removing the logic board—handy when downtime is short.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L11847-L11854】

### Long-Range Emoto Tuning Notes
- Noname’s single-Ubox commuter is clocking 100-mile rides by capping motor phase around 80 A and battery draw near 155 A to keep the QS hub under 45 °C, while he plans larger heatsinks (or even water cooling) before exploring higher power.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L7715-L7729】
- Rage Mechanics’ Thunder-based RM-X race scooter runs VESC 3Shul hardware on 22 S packs, has already won events against Savoton builds, and is targeting a 170 km/h record run on October 10; race data shows motor temps topping ~112 °C within minutes, so airflow and monitoring stay critical.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L11982-L12106】

### Extreme Performance Builds
- Volkan’s Langfeite GT2RS build is pushing twin LY hubs with 24 S 20 P EVE 40PL packs through 3Shul CL350 controllers—logs show 330 A phase, 170 A battery, 100 A of field-weakening at 20 kHz and only ~3 V sag, but a mis-set magnet count (30 instead of 40) inflated speed readings by ~39%, putting verified GPS runs around 120 km/h despite the display flashing 150–160 km/h on 13″ off-road tires.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18614-L18657】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L19146-L19253】
- Rage Mechanics’ latest customer project combines dual XHS75 hubs, paired CL350s, and a 20 S 10 P P45B pack inside dual waterproof cases with a steel steering pole, SmartDisplay dash, and Hope Tech 4 V4 brakes—a turnkey race spec awaiting 0–100 km/h testing.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L19894-L19899】

### Motor & Wiring Sourcing
- Paolo advises capping Nami motor phase current near 200–250 A unless you rewire with shorter, larger-gauge leads; stock PTFE-insulated conductors look thin but carry heat better than silicone, so confirm cross-section before replacement.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6030-L6077】
- Longyu (LY) manufactures many “65H” performance hubs; Vsett, Lonnyo, Huameng, and Kaabo-labeled motors are often rebrands, and Paolo cautions that some AliExpress “factory” sellers are just resellers despite marketing claims.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6381-L6416】
- Eleven-inch hub swaps can collide with suspension springs on stock swingarms, making zero/Kaabo-style 65H hubs the safer upgrade path for 10-inch frames than chasing oversized Vsett housings.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6369-L6389】
- Pandalgns is running Janobike T10 (52 V, “1000 W”) hubs at roughly 52 V/180 A phase for ~4 kW peaks in a Xiaomi Pro chassis, praising their durability but noting the deck still feels cramped compared with G30 frames.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18853-L18865】

### Legal & Compliance Notes
- Singapore’s once-thriving PEV scene is now heavily restricted—FalconPEV and Carbonrevo still operate, but licensing caps and
  photography bans at storefronts signal how hard it has become to buy or register high-power scooters locally compared with
  nearby markets that only check for plates.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21141-L21167】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21160-L21160】
- Spain’s DGT-certified scooters (e.g., Mantis King GT and Dualtron Victor) will retain street legality after January 2027, while Sur-Ron-class e-motos already need motorcycle registration; Fiido-style seated scooters still lack a registration path.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L12165-L12199】

### Battery Packaging & Maintenance
- PuneDir’s attempt to hang a 20S10P stem pack drew safety pushback—veterans prefer internal mounting or backpacks to avoid exposed mass on the mast, especially once existing decks are already full.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L5113-L5121】
- Water-soaked Niu motors came back to life after drying and regreasing bearings, but the group still recommends sealed bearings and added seals before riding through floods again.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6271-L6278】

### Charging & Trip Planning
- Yamal’s touring setup wrings about 100 km from a 40 Ah pack; he logged 400 km in a weekend by making two 10 A charge stops each way and now considers a 20 A fast charger the key upgrade for long routes, ideally paired with a spare pack for quicker turnarounds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L19827-L19840】

### BMS & Voltage References
- Quick math for 22 S packs: divide total voltage by 22 and compare to a single-cell curve; memorizing the linear 3.1–4.2 V window per cell helps translate pack percentage readings on the fly.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6358-L6363】

### Battery Pack Assembly & Insulation
- Builders layered plexiglass and fishpaper as rigid sidewalls, then doubled nickel over thin copper leads to stiffen current paths on tight decks.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L2025-L2035】
- Oversized JBD “100 A” enclosures actually measure ~27 mm once screws and heat sinks are counted, forcing silicone shims and spacer reprints for safe isolation in crowded bays.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L2041-L2087】
- Copper/nickel sandwich debates underscored oxidation trade-offs: nickel-plated steel caps stay popular, but anyone chasing 0.2 mm copper thickness was advised to pair it with 801H-grade power and watch tip pressure carefully.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L2146-L2200】
- When customs delays blocked metal boxes, riders wedged packs with foam blocks or even taped shells just to ride—stopgaps that need better thermal padding guidance before they become permanent fixes.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3051-L3056】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3302-L3327】

### BMS Tools & App Quirks
- JBD’s smartphone app blindly mirrors the handset language, so the “Softlock” toggle and balance thresholds only show up once you flip Android/iOS to English, load the admin APK, and reopen the menus.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L2098-L2135】
- ANT Smart BMS harness pinouts change between 10 S and higher packs; the actual diagrams sit inside AliExpress listings, and miswiring has already killed hardware, so the shared screenshot archive is now the group’s go-to reference.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3350-L3415】
- For ANT tuning, Lekrsu advises matching CellHighProtect/Recover to the warning thresholds so the pack trips and resets at the same voltages displayed on the dash.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L13695-L13703】

### BMS Selection & Cutoff Behavior
- AYO confirmed that ANT BMS units drop pack output entirely when they see over-voltage or high-current spikes—the controller shuts off, and he runs 16 S packs down to ~2.9 V per cell to avoid nuisance trips.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L13344-L13351】
- The group steered Pandalgns toward the 425 A peak / 170 A continuous ANT Smart BMS for a 20 S 10 P P42B build while stressing that headline peak ratings only last a few seconds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L13579-L13617】

### Controller & Powertrain Lessons
- Flipsky 84100 owners kept reiterating that 60–80 A battery and ~135 A phase is the realistic ceiling; reports of 120 A battery draw usually end in thermal or hardware failure (including the Chile burnout).【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3011-L3024】
- Makerbase 84100HP riders are capping battery current around 85–100 A despite the spec sheet’s 100 A phase claim, and NetworkDir reminded Zero owners that the factory phase looms struggle much past 60 A without rewiring.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9084-L9095】
- Jason advised stepping up to 100 V-rated controllers for 20 S packs—running 21 S or high regen on 85 V hardware is still risky even if you disable braking boosts—so voltage headroom should match the pack you plan to build.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9018-L9026】
- European builders reminded newcomers that typical three-phase residential feeds are ~16 A per leg (~11 kW total), so fantasies about 40 C home charging only work with industrial-grade service upgrades.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3288-L3296】
- Paolo keeps upgrading phase leads to roughly 2.5× stock cross-section to curb voltage drop, while PuneDir’s over-shunted square-wave controller started “coughing” between 25–50 km/h after his latest tune—both data points argue for thicker cabling and sane verification before chasing peak numbers.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3441-L3448】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3491-L3497】

### Late-Stage Controller Failures & Guardrails
- PuneDir’s shunt-heavy square-wave ESC is saturating a 1 kW motor and even previously blew traces and FETs; he can only mask the issue above ~50 km/h, so current limits need to match motor capability rather than what the modded board can momentarily supply.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3503-L3525】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3526-L3532】
- Yamal’s dual Little Focer/Tronic 250 build finally failed after repeated 37 A field-weakening pulls at ~20 kW; the group reiterated those controllers are happiest near 150 A phase (~5–8 kW) and surviving higher power requires stepping up to 12 FET Spintend or Tronic 250R-class hardware.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3730-L3732】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3702-L3710】
- Field-weakening cutoffs can cascade into catastrophic failures: both GABE and Yamal called out that an FW-induced shutdown can spike components and “kill everything,” so conservative FW settings plus proper battery headroom are mandatory for highway-speed testing.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3730-L3732】

### Budget Controller Shopping & Detection Pitfalls
- Spintend’s 12 FET controller remains the community’s go-to “budget but proven” choice for 20 S commuters, while Ubox Lite and full Ubox 85/250 units are the practical upgrade paths when customs or budget block Tronic replacements.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3562-L3568】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3738-L3753】
- Makerbase/Flipsky detection routines continue to misreport inductance and resistance by triple-digit percentages, and veterans now insist on measuring motor parameters with trusted tools (or a known-good VESC) before riding—automatic detection has already caused on-road accidents.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3854-L3875】
- Budget dual-motor dreams on G30 platforms still require two independent controllers; trying to save money with unknown AliExpress boards only shifts risk because capacitor banks, thermal mass, and layout quality vary wildly between look-alike units.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3754-L3788】

### Balance Leads, Harnessing & Spot-Welding Alternatives
- Jason’s balance-lead workflow keeps the JST harness plugged in while routing; if you misplace a wire the BMS simply refuses to boot until the lead is corrected, sparing the board as long as you fix the mistake quickly.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3834-L3848】
- Builders struggling with customs delays are experimenting with €25 purple PCB welders driven by 72 Ah car batteries; they weld 0.2 mm nickel reliably but likely lack the transistor count for 0.15 mm copper, reinforcing earlier advice to reserve thicker copper sandwiches for Glitter 801H rigs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L4259-L4273】
- PuneDir’s clamp-meter tests on a single phase showed how easy it is to overestimate delivered phase current when shunt mods and square-wave controllers are in play; he still targets 200 A phase / 150 A battery but the hardware happily overshoots into the 260 A phase range, so instrumentation and sane cabling remain vital.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3809-L3826】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L4049-L4069】

### Cells, Cabling & Supply Limits
- Samsung 32E cells are only good for ~6.5 A per can (≈39 A shared across six parallels), so stacking extra nickel over series joints adds little benefit on mid-power builds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L2360-L2370】
- Stock G30 phase wires are undersized “chinesium”; upgrading to silicone 12 AWG keeps short runs cool even if tables rate them for only 20 A continuous, as scooter duty cycles and AC drive let them survive bursts.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3381-L3403】
- Range-focused packs like 22 S 11 P LG M50LT builds still peak near 120 A with legacy controllers, and owners are already cutting fresh copper and P45B busbars after front-wheel spin exposed how the current pack sags above 100 km/h on 33×2 70H hubs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3351-L3355】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L13297-L13310】
- Teverun owners squeezing in LY 75 H hubs widened swingarms, plan titanium steering columns, and run 20 S 84 V Molicel P45B packs clamped to ~350 A even on Daly BMS hardware, while peers design 22 S 11 P P45B packs rated about 495 A for future upgrades.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9551-L9604】
- Builders reiterated that JK and ANT smart BMS units are the reliable picks—JK’s active balancing recycles charge whereas ANT burns it off, but Daly remains the community’s “worst in the industry” option despite its availability.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9608-L9614】
- Upgrading to ANT’s higher-current boards requires repinning the balance harness (different JST layout) and configuring parameters in the ANT Android app before riding.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10251-L10258】
- KWeld users powering copper busbar jobs lean on high-discharge LiPos such as the Turnigy Graphene 6000 mAh 3 S 75 C pack; expect ~60–70 J for 0.1 mm copper-on-nickel welds and plan layered stacks like three 0.15 mm nickel strips plus dual 0.2 mm copper when chasing very low resistance, using plenty of flux so the KWeld can wet up to ~0.4 mm of copper.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9956-L9959】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10810-L10848】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10894-L10894】
- Extending “silver” hub harnesses is safe with quality copper—those shiny conductors are just tinned copper, so matched-gauge copper leads maintain conductivity when lengthening motor looms.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10352-L10355】
- When upsizing controller leads, keep in mind that 4 mm² (~AWG 11) silicone wire may overheat around 250 A; riders testing new ESCs are double-checking temperatures before committing to full-power runs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10005-L10014】
- Parallel battery packs still need to be voltage-matched before connection—mixing a freshly charged 17 S extender with a 16 S main pack tripped the VESC repeatedly even through blocking diodes until both sat at the same voltage.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L13560-L13571】

### Tools & Build Process Tips
- Paolo walked PuneDir through reshaping that €25 square-wave ESC: use a bench supply, read millivolt drop across the shunt, and back into resistance with Ohm’s law instead of guessing with hobby meters.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L2964-L2987】
- Medhi tightened loose bullet plugs by wedging in a scrap of hard plastic, spreading the contact without gouging the connector bore.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L8117-L8120】
- When customs halted battery boxes, temporary solutions ranged from foam blocks to literal tape cocoons—fine for testing, but everyone acknowledged the need for sturdier printable cradles once imports resume.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3302-L3327】
- ADC throttle pods on Ubox 85/150 setups provide only momentary pulses for the on/off and light buttons (sharing the throttle ground), so riders integrating headlights or main power relays still need latching logic downstream.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9954-L9986】
- Motor winding audits for LY hubs rely on either opening the stator or using a four-wire milliohm meter like the YR1035+: VESC Tool’s estimates can be wildly off, and a 75 H 22×3 is unlikely to top 120 km/h without heavy field weakening, which helps confirm if a “33×2” shipment is legit.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9965-L9995】
- Nami chassis have evolved: V1 “Pringle” frames lacked neck reinforcement, later versions added a metal battery box and thicker side plates, and the latest “Tesla reinforcement” neck keeps the aluminum-magnesium frame (shared by Burn-E 2/2 Max) planted under big hits—owners report 20 k+ miles on early frames once reinforced.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10189-L10209】
- Community-made firmware archives now host official VESC 6.05 builds for legacy controllers like the Tronic 250R, and the iOS/Android/desktop VESC Tool releases reached feature parity during this span.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10129-L10129】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10438-L10454】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10594-L10594】
### High-Speed Zero 10X Lessons (Lines 20500–20950)
- PuneDir and NetworkDir reiterated that old 60-series Zero 10X frames (the ones without the cast “X” rib) keep cracking stems and necks; riders chasing 100 km/h need to inspect for fractures, avoid drilling the neck, and ideally swap in the newer 70-series hardware before pushing power.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20505-L20522】
- Shlomozero10🇮🇱 is presently running 60 A of field weakening per controller on mixed 50 H hubs; the crew urged him to dial FW back toward ~20 A, raise phase current to ~120 A at 30–35 kHz, and try the mxlemming observer so the motors survive long highway pulls.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20424-L20475】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20591-L20592】
- PuneDir confirmed his decoupling is set to BEMF, underscoring that as the baseline when dual 84100 builds start hunting for stability at triple-digit speeds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20862-L20863】
- Above ~65 km/h the group treats lane changes as a last resort and even removes helmet-mounted GoPros that tug on the rider’s head in crosswinds, preferring smooth weight transfer over dramatic steering inputs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21248-L21258】

### Brake & Throttle Hardware Picks
- 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁 recommended a waterproof three-pin thumb throttle with virtually no dead zone and warned that the CNC Spin-Y2 twin-action throttle breaks easily despite its regen convenience, so stock spares or alternative throttles when budgeting a build.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20536-L20567】
- For brake cutoffs, 'lekrsu' steered riders toward levers with hall sensors instead of simple two-wire switches—especially for smaller hands—and 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁 pointed to waterproof two-pin hydraulic sensors that pair cleanly with Magura or Nutt setups.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20927-L20937】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21186-L21187】
- Noname noted you can repurpose a spare throttle as an auxiliary brake input wired in parallel, but it only contributes meaningful braking if regen current is set high, so lever ergonomics still matter for everyday stops.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20931-L20933】

### Copper Pack Fabrication Tactics
- Haku is cutting and folding 0.20–0.25 mm copper for a 20 S pack; Noname suggested sliding fiberboard between layers during the fold, and Haku is modelling 3D-printed T insulators or epoxy spacers so the positive and negative busbars stay separated once the stack is compressed.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20717-L20725】
- The crew settled on four weld points per cell and a layer of barley paper at the end of each series strip so heavy packs survive handling without copper chafing through the insulation.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21401-L21405】
- Springy copper can be pre-tensioned by dragging it gently over a table edge—the slight reverse bend kept Haku’s 0.25 mm sheets seated once the first welds landed, making the rest of the fold safer.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21549-L21555】
- External battery bags proved too flimsy for Haku’s twin-pack minibike build: the main 20 S 12 P P42A brick now needs tailor-added straps or a rigid base to stop the sag, while the 20 S 10 P 40T extender will stay outside the frame until a stronger enclosure is fabricated.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21426-L21437】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21534-L21560】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21594-L21602】
- 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁’s 30 S ANT BMS misreports cell voltages when wired to a 22 S harness, highlighting the need for a clear pinout and configuration guide before builders down-populate those boards.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21317-L21318】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21396-L21396】

### Fitment & Motor Sourcing Updates
- Some markets still deliver the Zero 10X as a single-motor scooter with a dummy front hub—upgraders import a live front wheel from outlets like FalconPEV and should expect to rewire mixed Zero/Mantis motors while monitoring frame integrity above ~100 km/h.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L20578-L20610】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21129-L21144】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21148-L21154】
- Paolo reminded the group that a Zero 10X needs about 145 mm of fork spacing and a longer axle to swallow an 11-inch hub—stock 125 mm dropouts top out near 65 H 10-inch motors unless you extend the swingarm or buy a conversion kit such as FalconPEV’s.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21169-L21180】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21339-L21348】
- Builders keep leaning on ElectroCustom, Sonken Engineering, and Lonnyo for high-power drivetrains, while Face de Pin’s clamp that ties both steering nuts to the stem has become the go-to insurance policy against Thunder hinge failures.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21339-L21348】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21749-L21756】
- Face de Pin is also machining waterproof C350 enclosures and in-house frame parts so their racing Namis can run in the rain without exposing controllers, showcasing a repeatable packaging model for other Thunder owners.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L22050-L22072】
- GABE’s Ninebot G30 project illustrates how to fit a 70 H 22×3 hub and twin MP2 controllers without grinding structural arches: stack the pack to ~14.5 cm, park the BMS vertically up front, run multiple 8 AWG leads into parallel QS8s, and cool the controllers with a finned enclosure fed by tyre airflow.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21845-L21929】


### Controller & Firmware Updates (Lines 21500–22075)
- VESC Tool 6.05 ships with a Lisp demo that streams converted MP3s straight to the motor, but riders reported severe frame resonance and awful fidelity, framing it as a novelty rather than a usable feature.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21480-L21499】
- TrentXWB killed a mid-speed rattle by switching to LemmingMX parameters at 35 A battery and 90 A phase; the single-motor setup now tops out near 44 km/h without needing field weakening.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21762-L21770】

### Battery & Pack Projects
- Raphaël converted his race build into a commuter by trading drag bars for a higher handlebar, retuning suspension, adding lighting, and ultimately favoring the waterproof Dualtron Thunder chassis over the less-sealed Nami frame for city duty.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21503-L21521】
- Haku is welding a 20 S 12 P Molicel 40T main pack (240 cells) plus a 20 S 10 P extender, relying on 0.25 mm copper strip; once the new welder consumables were dialed in it consistently handled 0.25–0.30 mm busbars without blowing holes.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21545-L21556】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21964-L21970】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21980-L21984】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L22014-L22016】
- External battery bags for the project need structural help: the 20 S 10 P module is too bulky for the scooter’s compartment, so Haku plans tailor-added straps, reinforced panels, or filling the storage cavity instead of letting the hanging pack stress the frame mid-ride.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21534-L21560】
- To tame springy copper sheet before welding, Noname suggested gently bending the strip back over a table edge—the stock flattens once a few welds pin it in place.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21549-L21555】
- 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁 is already riding a 22 S 11 P Molicel P45B pack without cam or hall sensors and is seeking configuration help, highlighting the need for a robust sensorless setup guide at that voltage.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L22073-L22074】

### Frame & Chassis Notes
- Shlomozero10🇮🇱 is still street-riding his 100 km/h Zero 10X with only a rear Nutt four-piston brake plus regen; the group kept
  urging him to restore the front brake before more highway pulls given the wind buffeting and lane changes in his videos.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21194-L21218】
- Zero 10X owners chasing 100–105 km/h speeds are packaging everything “French style” inside bespoke frames, often relocating the ESC externally and leaning on ~22 S 11 P packs that approach 9 kW—expensive custom fab is the tradeoff.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21728-L21744】
- Face de Pin Sucé’s shop can squeeze a 22 S 8 P C350 pack inside the Thunder by using their proprietary internal case and a clamp that ties the steering stem to both axle nuts, which they say has prevented hinge failures even for aggressive riders.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21749-L21756】
- Lengthening the chassis increases portability pain: Andrei pointed out that extended frames struggle with small elevators, though 24 S stacks can still fit standard decks when spacers are omitted.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21745-L21761】
- Face de Pin keeps their racing Nami fleet rain-ready with a waterproof enclosure for the C350 controller and is now fabricating most frame parts in-house, underscoring their manufacturing depth.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L22050-L22053】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L22072-L22072】
- NetworkDir’s comparison thread ranked the Inmotion RS and even the Thunder’s earlier frame over Dualtron’s T3 and Storm LTD due to folding-head weaknesses, reinforcing which donor chassis merit upgrades.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L22057-L22063】
- Builders confirmed the current fork project can swallow 70 H motors but likely not the thicker 75 H variants, so check clearance before ordering larger stators for that setup.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L22000-L22002】
- 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara is converting his former race Thunder into a waterproofed city build—raising the handlebar, revalving suspension, and adding lighting—because reassembling his Nami takes longer and leaves the scooter less weatherproof for daily use.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21508-L21524】

### Review Status
- The part 009 export presently ends at line 22,075 with Face de Pin’s frame-fabrication update and 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁’s sensorless 22 S 11 P request, so no further lines are available until the next transcript slice lands.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L22070-L22075】

### Accessory Power & Instrumentation
- EY3-style Minimotors displays don’t natively talk to Flipsky’s non-VESC FT85BD controllers or the look-alike Ubox Lite clones floating around AliExpress; NetworkDir pointed Dede toward the VSETT Lisp bridge for protocol translation and warned that leaving the bridge’s throttle-out lead disconnected is the fastest way to brick the setup.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21880-L21903】
- Builders looking to power GPS or lighting off high-voltage packs are grabbing wide-input buck modules (9–120 V down to 5 V at 2–3 A); Finn and Her0DasH now meter them with a bench supply before use because mislabeled boards have overvolted 6 V lamps, the advertised 1 mA standby draw needs verification, and the VESC ADC daughterboard is only an analog interface—not a step-down able to feed accessories.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21797-L21839】
- Noname vouched for a $10 USB GPS speedometer that boots within a minute when powered from 5 V, offering a simple dashboard alternative for scooters lacking CAN accessories.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L21858-L21867】
