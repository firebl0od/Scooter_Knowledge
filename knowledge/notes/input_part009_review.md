## Key Findings

### Lighting & Control Wiring
- Tronic 250 aux 5 V rail keeps a 0.6 W taillight permanently on; moving the light to the connector beside the CAN bus only powers it while the controller is awake, otherwise add a self-latching switch for manual control.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L41-L78】
- The VESC ADC lighting harness uses high-side switching: brake output sources battery positive while ground is shared with the headlight, so combine functions with diodes or resistors and wire anodes to the function pins, cathodes to ground as noted in the updated diagram.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L46-L96】
- Xiaomi/Ninebot builders confirmed that an ADC expander can coexist with the stock dashboard by wiring the ADC module to ADC1/ADC2 and the dash to RX/TX, keeping cruise-control experiments possible without extra buttons.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L1253-L1255】
- The Spintend ADC accessory’s built-in 12 V rail only sources about 3 A, so dual 12 V headlights need a dedicated buck converter or relay harness instead of pulling both beams from the board directly.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L14989-L15037】

### Battery Building Insights
- Zero 10X pack builders layer thin epoxy sheets between the balance harness and copper busbars when holders won’t fit; epoxy boards keep insulation while staying slimmer than plexiglass spacers.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L17151-L17170】
- Mixing grey and purple LG M26 cells is acceptable here because every parallel group was binned to the same internal resistance; consistency matters more than colorways.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L32-L37】
- Molicel P42A packs show little benefit for scooters limited to ~120 A battery draw; 50H motors on 20 S without ferrofluid saturate around 60 A battery current, so cheaper cells may suffice.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L48-L49】
- Custom ASA‑CF cell holders require a heated build chamber to avoid warping, but the result is extremely rigid; expect filament costs near €50 per 750 g—roughly double standard ASA.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L607-L615】
- Builders caution that XT90S anti-spark connectors fail quickly under scooter duty; QS8s are the preferred drop-in upgrade for higher reliability.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L627-L628】
- Running range-extender packs with their own BMS in parallel works if the packs share voltage, but a tripped BMS can dump the full load on the others and instantly overstress them—plan for coordinated limits and protection.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L470-L476】
- Heavy 17 S builds reported that VESC electrical braking respects the 71.4 V full-charge voltage, so regen at 72 V setpoints stays within controller limits.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L1015-L1020】
- Rebuilt honeycomb packs benefitted from silicone spacers plus fishpaper or Kapton between series rows to preserve insulation while hot-gluing parallel groups, especially when wraps need replacing.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L1354-L1383】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L1946-L1953】
- Using twin steel strips over nickel is acceptable for ~8 A per cell in LG M26 builds, but ensure reinforcement and plan for ~10–11 kW limits on 17P layouts.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L1044-L1062】
- Active balancing boards can equalize large packs in about an hour, whereas relying on the JBD BMS’s onboard balancing would take days—handy when finishing high-capacity assemblies.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L1904-L1905】
- AYO nearly ordered 0.01 mm copper for his 22S11P P45B build before the group reminded him that busbars need 0.1 mm sheet; the thinner foil is craft-stock that tears under welding current.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L8020-L8036】
- PuneDir’s friend drained a JK-managed pack to 57 V and lost BMS comms, and GABE confirmed leaving cells near 2.5 V for days kills them—charge range-extender packs well before hard cutoffs to avoid permanent damage.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9180-L9203】
- Copper strip shaping matters on heavy packs: sharpened tabs near the positive terminal can slice insulation under a 14 kg load, so builders now chamfer nickel/copper busbars around the can top before shrinking everything down.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L11022-L11042】
- Several pack makers reiterated that tight-tolerance 3D-printed holders dramatically improve spacing and heat paths versus hot glue alone; PETG can work, but ASA/ABS handles flex and parked-car temperatures better, and it may be worth printing in higher-temp filament if the pack is long.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L11059-L11109】
- Double-layer “makaron” heat-shrink sleeves are being used in place of fishpaper between rows; veterans note it survives lighter abuse but still prefer fishpaper for series barriers because shrink alone scuffs faster.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L11199-L11220】
- Builders warned that leaving smart-BMS apps online invites tampering—JBD’s cloud portal can expose packs to remote limit tweaks, and ANT’s Android app hardcodes the monitor password so changing it throws a connection error; keep packs offline or stick with the default credentials if you need remote checks.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L14343-L14350】
- Squeezing 20 S 6 P 21700 bricks into a G30 chassis took a 36 mm deck extender and roughly 1 mm of grinding around the 6 mm-tall rail opening; without machining the lip, the pack and twin MP2 controllers won’t drop in cleanly.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L14702-L14735】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L14814-L14825】
- JK’s app-controlled BMS lets riders disable the discharge MOSFET to cut power and keep a parked scooter from waking up, offering a quick anti-theft toggle once the pack is topped off.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L17684-L17699】
- Compact 10 S builds drawing 30–45 A per cell still lean on smart boards such as JK or JBD 100 A units (with ANT as a backup) despite the tight packaging, prioritizing dependable protection and telemetry.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18225-L18241】
- When deconstructing welded packs, veterans prefer flush cutters to lift nickel tabs without grinding off the plating; stubborn specks can stay in place because new strip welds cleanly over the remnant once the surface is flattened.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18829-L18849】
- Adhesive-lined “marine” heat-shrink grips bullet connectors far better than thin sleeves that slide off under load, making it a go-to for battery leads if you don’t mind the glue.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18894-L18900】
- The group pegs EVE 40PL cells at roughly 45–70 A continuous despite 100 A marketing claims, and early stress tests show about 60 % capacity remaining after 300 cycles at 30 A—great for torque bursts, but expect shorter life than Molicel P42As run at similar rates.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L19531-L19588】
- 🇪🇸AYO#74 secures rebuilt modules by tacking the outer cells with hot silicone and cinching the stack with glass filament tape so vibration can’t fret the wraps—a lightweight alternative when custom holders don’t fit.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L19902-L19907】

### Enclosures & Packaging
- Mounting VESCs on top of the G30 battery stack traps heat because of the silicone isolation pad; clamping controllers to the deck sides or belly keeps them in direct contact with aluminum for better cooling.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L14891-L14894】
- PuneDir has been welding custom steel controller/battery boxes so hard crashes don’t shred housings—a reminder that temporary sheet enclosures should eventually give way to rigid metalwork or pro-fab cases.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15261-L15271】

### Cooling & Packaging Concepts
- Jan’s ducting approach routes controller heat into the rear wheel well: shape the mudguard into a tunnel with fins aligned radially to the tire, add rubber skirts to tighten the seal, and let the spinning wheel pull air through—no auxiliary fans needed while moving.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15799-L15827】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15833-L15845】

### Scooter Maintenance & Safety
- Zero 10X owners reported the rear shock is roughly 165 mm but the stock front only 135–137 mm; swapping to ~145 mm front units improves trail and makes the chassis less prone to cracking the neck under hard riding, whereas the short factory shocks feel undersprung for MTB-style use.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18509-L18527】
- A brand-new Zero 10X rear tire ballooned into the suspension after only 7 km; extending the shock eyelet restored clearance, and pack temps stayed near 35 °C—double-check fresh tire installs for rubbing under load.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18059-L18085】
- Zero’s neck and axle castings keep cracking around the factory lightening holes, so high-power builders are migrating to Vsett or SNSC/G30 frames instead of pouring parts into the Zero chassis.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18154-L18170】
- Kukirin G4 wobble complaints trace back to deformed stock tubeless tires and a front-shock pivot bolt that can shear; plan on replacing the tires, inspecting that bolt, and adding a proper fork or damper before chasing higher speeds since the chassis geometry itself is marginal past ~60 km/h.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15132-L15198】
- Several owners also noticed the wheel rocking inside the fork even when fasteners are tight, so expect to tear down the axle stack and add shims or bushings if you want the steering to stay stable long term.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15201-L15208】
- After a minor crash, another G4 rider found the scooter unstable above ~60 km/h until he tightened the steering-head screw Kukirin hides at the front bearing; he also confirmed the frame is spacious but the stock single motor needs ~8 kW to touch 90 km/h and overheats quickly on that tune.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L16251-L16308】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L16340-L16360】

### Tires & Wheels
- Builders chasing 13″ rubber on 7″ rims say options are limited to CST Dualtron X tires; PMT’s minibike lineup outperforms most car brands but doesn’t yet cover that rim, so custom LY rims or larger-wheel conversions are needed for premium compounds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18643-L18659】

### Brake Setup & Fluids
- Magura calipers hold up better with higher-temp fluids such as Bionol plus upgraded rotors, whereas the stock oil and discs boil easily; riders running DOT-based Hope brakes report similar reliability once tuned for 100 km/h builds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L17921-L17925】

### Quality Control Watch-outs
- Multiple members documented a €270 store-built pack with unsecured nickel, dented cells, and “repairs” that relied on electrical tape; the vendor refused refunds and suggested the buyer fund new cells despite the safety hazards.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L315-L370】

### Market & Vendor Alerts
- SlackPEV’s site briefly lapsed and its Turkish distributor allegedly took deposits without delivering scooters, so buyers are steering clear or insisting on escrow for boutique orders.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18708-L18729】
- Paolo reiterated that Rion has been a scam for years—many customers waited three years or never received builds even after the ownership shuffle—while Weped’s service remains spotty despite premium pricing.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18739-L18747】
- Hands-on inspections of Slack scooters called out rough welds, weak fork/stem hardware, and pricing near €8,900 for what feels like a €4,000 chassis; Rage Mechanics only trusts the titanium frame with extensive reinforcement and won’t race it as delivered, ranking Weped Fold 3 as the only halfway-refined Korean frame and labeling the rest “trash.”【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L19386-L19454】

### Controller Setup & Troubleshooting
- VESC Tool doesn’t require a physical throttle—builders are driving scooters via the Balance app, UART remotes, or CAN clients—but that openness lets anyone nearby change settings, so lock Bluetooth access or power controllers down when not tuning.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18662-L18671】
- ABS over-current trips can be mitigated by raising the Max ABS Current in VESC Tool when the hardware and wiring allow it.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L193-L198】
- Keyboard control in VESC Tool must be explicitly enabled in the UI (right-side toggle) even after a successful motor wizard run—useful when pairing Ubox controllers with M365 dashboards.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L257-L294】
- For Flipsky 75200 V2 installs that heat motors during free-spin, disable the phase filter, rerun detection, switch to the `mxlemming` observer, and cap currents at ~120 A motor / 50–60 A battery with -5 A regen until the tune is stable.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L768-L783】
- Makerbase confirmed the 75/200 boards are built around Huayi HYG015N10NS1TA MOSFETs, so replacements should match those specs if you’re repairing blown phases.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L8321-L8333】
- When bench-testing a Spintend VESC on a DC PSU, disable regen and avoid free-spinning field-weakening, otherwise back-EMF can over-voltage the supply and pop it.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L1120-L1125】
- Small hub motors driven by Flipsky 75200s showed that aggressive field-weakening observers (`mxm` variants) deliver speed but have killed controllers; increasing system voltage or easing FW demand is safer than pushing tiny motors past their limits.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L1290-L1331】
- Sensorless VESC operation in FOC is viable but expect to push-start the wheel or invest time in HFI tuning to avoid squealing stalls.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L1713-L1721】
- Spintend 85150 controllers rely on 100 V-class components, yet reports show units failing at 20 S when high-kV motors, MTPA, and heavy field-weakening stack stress on the hardware—stay conservative on voltage boost strategies.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L1522-L1536】
- Paolo highlighted reliability gaps in unvetted MOSFETs (e.g., fake datasheets from JJmicro) and favors Huayi parts that hold 20 kW loads below 40 °C—verify switching parameters before adopting bargain FETs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L1541-L1555】
- Regen-only braking is still punishing on small hub motors: GABE’s 800 W setup hit 45 A of negative battery current and cooked cells until he added mechanical brakes and temperature monitoring.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L8094-L8114】
- Makerbase Lite owners saw core temps drop ~25 °C after swapping the factory 5 mm interface for 0.5 mm thermal pads and keeping the controller clamped directly to aluminum—thicker pads act as insulation instead of a heatsink bridge.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L8287-L8298】
- When editing ADC settings over CAN, always `Read` the active controller first; the VESC Tool can silently write the same ID to both units if you flip between tabs without reloading, which is how Pandalgns “lost” CAN comms on twin 84100HPs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L8961-L8973】
- Makerbase 84100HP owners confirmed that ~55 mΩ detection values on older 45 H Mantis hubs are normal—the low-kV wind keeps resistance high even when the controller is healthy.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L14021-L14036】
- A 250 W Xiaomi hub cooked itself when spun on 13 S with heavy field weakening; stepping back to the stock Xiaomi ESC highlights how little headroom those commuter motors have for over-voltage experiments.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L14042-L14044】
- NetworkDir reminded dual-VESC builders to enter wheel diameter, pole count, and gear ratio on both controllers so the secondary doesn’t report 15 km/h while the primary shows 100 km/h during bench tests.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L8197-L8203】
- Koxx also warned to unplug CAN jumpers when reassigning IDs; otherwise both controllers can take the same new address and leave you diagnosing “dead” transceivers that were just overwritten.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9068-L9071】
- PuneDir confirmed that using CAN still lets you tune front and rear currents independently—the VESC Tool doesn’t mirror limits when you adjust each node through the shared Bluetooth session.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9046-L9067】
- Plug the CAN harness in before you energize the controllers; booting them first left Shlomo’s pair invisible until he rewired the bus and matched IDs, whereas bridging throttles is only a last-resort fallback when CAN is down.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L14351-L14366】
- VESC faults clear automatically once the throttle is released—holding the trigger during a fault just stretches the shutdown window and keeps the scooter limp longer than necessary.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L14970-L14971】
- Xiaomi-class ESCs get flaky above 12 S: GABE’s 13 S build kept tripping until he rebuilt as a 12 S 6 P pack, trading voltage for reliability on daily-use commuters.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L14989-L14998】
- Running 35 A battery current for 30 km in 35 °C heat overheated a Gen 4 G30 hub that lacked motor and ESC temperature sensors—after the warning squeal, the group now treats thermal instrumentation as mandatory for high-phase tunes.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15009-L15026】
- Even with the battery unplugged, Ubox controllers can wake for a second off charged capacitors; wait for LEDs to die before probing so you don’t short energized rails during rewiring.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L19021-L19022】
- Splitting battery current across both motors beats running a single motor hot: PuneDir measured 20 A into one hub as slower than 10 A/10 A across the pair, so leave dual-drive builds linked unless a motor is down for service.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18575-L18576】
- Always de-energize accessories before probing: Noname shorted a Nucular u-light board because the new BMS was still awake, underscoring the need to depower packs before unplugging sense boards.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15284-L15290】
- Battery wattage is still calculated from instantaneous pack voltage × pack current; VESC Tool’s realtime display shows phase amps, so expect peak “watts” there to overshoot battery power unless you convert using pack readings.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9504-L9514】
- Riders dialing in budget dual setups noted that 84100HP controllers on a 14 S 4 P Samsung 50E pack (Janobike T10 motors) topped out near 56 km/h despite 120 A phase limits—pointing to battery sag rather than controller specs for missing top speed.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9746-L9760】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9765-L9775】
- Child-safe profiles work best through the VESC Tool “Profiles” tab: scaling Max Current to roughly 60 % let one parent cap a scooter at ~5 mph for training while keeping starts smooth.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10073-L10087】
- Spintend honored a dual Ubox 75100 failure (caps burst at 72 V, 150 A BMS, dual-motor build) by shipping replacements; their support also pushed VESC firmware/app 6.05 updates that fixed configuration resets and left the scooter running noticeably smoother.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9910-L9928】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10129-L10129】
- Long phase-lead runs can choke current: a VESC-bike on a Flipsky 75100 with ~2 m phase cables stuttered past 11 A phase, reinforcing the need for short, low-resistance wiring on geared hubs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10494-L10515】
- 3Shul traction control can shunt torque rearward—builders testing 22 S 33×2 LY hubs with 70 % field weakening hit ~126 km/h, while Kelly-driven 20 S builds with 60 H high-speed hubs saw 138 km/h GPS without FW; traction control was temporarily disabled to explore the limits.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10292-L10324】
- Jan reported 20 S 6 P packs with dual Ubox 85/250s and 33×2 motors reaching 136 km/h without field weakening, illustrating what fully discharged high-speed LY setups can deliver when the pack keeps up.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10625-L10627】
- Zero 10X hubs that overheat on modest 30 A battery / 70 A phase / 20 A FW tunes point to setup issues—regen adds heat, and one rider’s motor detection showed 172 mΩ instead of the normal ~40 mΩ, suggesting bad shunt calibration or wiring; rerun detection on known-good hardware (e.g., 84100) before drilling for cooling.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L11001-L11010】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L11223-L11262】
- Flipsky 75100 failures that keep blowing FETs even unloaded often trace back to damaged gate-drive circuitry—check the FET drivers and op-amps before throwing in another transistor set.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L11818-L11920】
- Makerbase 84100 components are still best kept at 20 S despite 100 V marketing; riders exploring 23 S packs were advised to stick to ≤20 S unless they accept the risk of running beyond the manufacturer’s comfort zone.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L12011-L12033】
- A single VESC cannot drive two motors at once—dual-motor builds still need one controller per hub plus CAN for coordination.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L12486-L12489】
- JPPL’s official VESC display ran out of RAM when Wi-Fi and Bluetooth were enabled together; leaving only one wireless interface active keeps the UI responsive.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L12510-L12513】
- Low-kV motors still fail to reach the 250 A phase limits advertised for single Ubox 85/150 installs, underscoring that the hardware cap is theoretical when the motor’s electrical parameters constrain current draw.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L12555-L12557】
- Denis Shelema logged that field weakening on his setup let battery current creep above the configured 60 A limit and the only stable fix was to reset and rerun the motor wizard, reapplying settings afterwards.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L12904-L12930】
- Makerbase’s 12 FET line seems happiest at ~180 A phase per controller (cool climates have seen 200 A), while Spintend’s 12 FET Ubox routinely handles 250–300 A when cooled; chasing the MOSFET’s 700 A datasheet number is fantasy unless you triple-phase that rating.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15383-L15455】
- Lisa’s latest Flipsky 75200 still popped the moment it was plugged in—even though the V2 hardware finally nails motor detection—reinforcing why many riders are pivoting to Ubox or Makerbase for 5–6 kW builds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15391-L15405】
- Finn traced motor oversaturation on a long-phase-cable build to ~2 m of lead between controller and hub, reinforcing the earlier advice to minimize phase-run length on high-power scooters.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L12968-L12970】
- NetworkDir recommends turning on traction control (or at least matching tire, pole, and gear values across CAN nodes) so slipping front wheels don’t inflate speed readings beyond GPS reality.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L13108-L13115】
- Paolo reminded high-power riders that sensorless front hubs can chatter around 10–15 km/h; soldering in hall sensors resolves the low-speed vibration on 33×2 70H motors.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L13508-L13516】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L13527-L13534】
- 3Shul CL350 V4 owners cleared ABS over-current faults by rerunning detection with a 500 µs timing step, switching from `mxlemming` to the Ortega observer, and dialing in the tune manually as in Vedder’s demos.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L17692-L17699】
- PuneDir’s Zero 10X runs cleanly with 120 A phase, 60 A battery per controller, about 15 A of field-weakening, and the `mxlemming` observer—more FW or a different observer just inflated the speed reading without usable thrust.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18275-L18305】

### Telemetry & Calibration
- Mantis owners running 10" hubs reported VESC Tool’s wheel-circumference value of 253–254 mm keeps the dashboard speed close to GPS—254 mm reads about 3–5 km/h high but is acceptable for quick benchmarking.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15504-L15522】

### Performance Benchmarks & Racing Notes
- Jan’s dual 85/250 G30 currently peaks around 21 kW on a 20 S 6 P P42A pack with a 550 A BMS; stepping up to Samsung 40PL cells would raise the limit to roughly 26–34 kW, but only if the wiring and controllers can tolerate 200–250 A battery draw.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L17045-L17053】
- Jan’s enclosed dual Spintend 85/250 build on a 20 S 6 P P42A pack is delivering ~20 kW and 136 km/h while keeping everything inside the G30 frame, proving how much headroom the chassis has once the deck is machined for clearance.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L14260-L14272】
- Face de Pin Sucé’s race team still caps out near 147 km/h on 20 S 8 P 40T packs with 70 H motors—about 25 kW—because beyond that the 11‑inch frames hit aero limits, resonate, and would need 40 kW+ plus major chassis work to flirt with 200 km/h claims.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L14905-L14949】
- Jan’s next commuter experiment is a 19 S 6 P low‑kV 65 H single-motor G30 targeting roughly 200 km of range without deck spacers, highlighting how far internal energy storage can stretch on optimized hub builds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15183-L15190】
- PuneDir’s Zero 10X GPS runs sit around 103 km/h today, and he’s planning a 25 kW setup to push 0–100 km/h toward 12 s—reminding riders that accurate GPS timing (Dragy, etc.) is the gold standard for bragging rights.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15472-L15499】

### Build Logs & Upgrade Plans
- Kukirin G4 builders continue to exploit the roomy frame: one is swapping to LY 70H hubs, designing adjustable dropouts, and feeding a 20 S 8 P Samsung 50S pack that can deliver ~360 A peak, though his Ubox 85150 will cap usable output below the battery’s ceiling.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L16520-L16560】
- A customer build proved the G4’s stock motor can hit 90 km/h on a Ubox 85150 and 20 S 8 P pack but demanded about 8 kW and “oven” temperatures, reinforcing why riders often budget for motor upgrades alongside controller swaps.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L16291-L16308】

### Spot Welders & Power Delivery
- Glitter 801D users saw LiPo-fed capacitor banks sag toward 5.7 V, with weld quality falling off unless they rotate packs or switch to low-ESR capacitor supplies.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L2001-L2013】
- Paolo cautioned that KWelds will still trip on over-current if the input bank is oversized or the cabling is wrong, so Glitter owners shouldn’t expect immunity just because they run capacitors.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L2015-L2018】
- Builders weighing upgrades highlighted why the 801H is the “buy once” choice: twenty transistors instead of five, stronger shunts/protection, and better welding pens for regions where returns are costly.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L2054-L2056】
- Follow-up chatter clarified limits—GABE flatly noted that a stock 801D cannot reliably weld 0.15 mm copper, so heavier sandwiches belong on the 801H plan.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L2959-L2960】

### Spot Welder Power Debates & Alternatives
- Paolo reiterated that 60 Ah car batteries only deliver ~750 A pulses and still trip KWeld overcurrent faults, urging builders to avoid lead-acid sources and instead size their cabling/connectors (QS8/EC8 with 25 mm² leads) for KWeld’s ~2000 A ceiling.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L5004-L5076】
- Cihan confirmed 80–100 Ah starter batteries sag under KWeld loads and, at best, feed roughly 1000 A if you keep them above 10 V—reinforcing why builders graduate to capacitor banks or LiPo sources for thick copper jobs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9011-L9012】
- The same thread recommends TIG with a low-cost timer board as a clean alternative that sidesteps cable heating losses when spot welders keep faulting, particularly for builders chasing thick copper sandwiches.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L5057-L5068】
- Later updates confirm Glitter 801D success only when pairing 0.1 mm copper with steel or iron caps; pure nickel sandwiches tear free even at full power, underscoring the need for higher-grade machines before attempting thicker copper stacks.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6203-L6239】

### Wiring & Materials Experiments
- Builders are testing thin-glass-fiber-insulated wire rated for 800 °C because its slim jacket may squeeze 6 mm² conductors into Lonnyo 65H 33×2 hubs; Jan cautions that the wiring job, not the cable sourcing, is the real bottleneck since rewinding each motor eats hours.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15852-L15879】
- Tristan’s math shows 6 mm² copper leads add roughly 0.000285 Ω, so at 150 A the wire dumps ~6.3 W while the XT90 connector likely becomes the hotter choke point—still monitor controller and connector temps despite the low conductor loss.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L16423-L16441】

### Suspension, Tires & Mounting
- Riders comparing EXA shocks report that KKE dampers outperform EXA 388/291 units, with 60 kg riders advised to start around 650–850 lb springs (1000 lb if running twin shocks) and adjust upward only for firmer feel.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L5168-L5228】
- Tubeless tire swaps on 11–12 inch rims are easiest with ratchet straps or belts plus pry bars; small pumps can seat beads once the strap preloads the carcass, offering a portable alternative to shop compressors.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6281-L6333】
- Solid-tire installs on G30-class hubs go smoother if you heat the tire in boiling water (or a microwave) for roughly 10–15 minutes, brace the motor on the floor, lever it on with two tire irons, and finish with soapy water to help it seat evenly.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L8387-L8398】
- PuneDir’s 12-inch conversion on a Zero 10X highlights clearance challenges, while Paolo notes that true 11-inch motors often foul suspension springs unless spacers are reworked—keep motor diameter in mind before chasing larger rims.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6281-L6299】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6369-L6371】
- A fresh Zero 10X hub arrived with a warped rotor that scraped the caliper until the owner reworked the alignment—another reminder to inspect brake spacing anytime motors are swapped or rewired with thicker leads.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L17943-L17952】
- CEPP revived the JREV Speedfork project with redesigned brake brackets and 11-inch clearance plus teased G30 rear suspension kits, but Jan says the release violates his original IP—worth tracking in case legal drama halts availability.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9204-L9213】
- 80 H and 75 H LY hubs can squeeze into Thunder swingarms when you open the dropout to roughly 155 mm and add 5 mm spacers per side, though the rims are custom CNC parts to keep the wheel centered.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L11610-L11635】
- Rain race prep emphasized tire choice: Rage Mechanics swapped scooter slicks three times across wet qualifying and mixed-condition heats to stay competitive.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L11632-L11637】
- Bigger-diameter wheels still rule off-road—builders noted 21"/19" e-moto combos ride better than 10" scooter rims even with more suspension travel.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L11866-L11868】
- Stock Vsett rims remain tube-only; one rider logged four flats in under a year and confirmed tubeless conversions aren’t practical without changing wheels, making solid or heavy-duty tubes the realistic alternative.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L12170-L12200】
- Brake rotor slot direction matters: orient the cooling slots “leading” on the front, but flip a rear rotor if the slots face the wrong way after a wheel swap.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L12472-L12477】

### Workshop Tools & Techniques
- A 1/4"-hex impact driver is handy for scooters if you use impact-rated sockets and throttle the trigger—keep it off split-rim bolts unless you’re just spinning them on, and never tap threads with an impact because the hammering will shatter the cutters.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15566-L15585】
- Step drills remain the cleanest way to enlarge round switch holes for power buttons and panel-mount XT60s, while oblong cuts still need a file or nibbler; once the hardware is in, tighten axle nuts with a hand ratchet instead of an impact so you can feel clamp load and avoid stripping threads.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L19023-L19038】

### Controller & Firmware Notes
- Xiaomi XESC controllers can run field-weakening up to ~20 S if hardware mods raise voltage sensing, but veterans warn that FW cutoffs can still brick Xiaomi and G30 ESCs—treat FW as optional speed boost, not daily tuning baseline.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L5231-L5274】
- Community feedback pegs Spintend minis at ~135 A phase from the factory; pushing 180–200 A plus FW has cracked hardware, so plan cable mods or bigger controllers for sustained power experiments.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6008-L6036】
- Windows users continue to report VESC Tool 6.05 launch failures even though the build runs on Ubuntu, suggesting a lingering installer or dependency issue worth documenting alongside the newly posted 6.05 binaries.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6354-L6356】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6483-L6490】
- Happy Giraffe outlined the safe upgrade path from VESC Tool 6.05 beta: export your configuration backup from the beta build, install the official 6.05 release, flash the matching firmware, then restore the backup so throttle and limit settings survive the transition.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10709-L10723】
- Paolo flagged ongoing quality risks with legacy Makerbase boards: the discontinued dual 100/100 struggled on firmware newer than 5.2 because the factory sourced second-hand (and sometimes fake) STM chips during the shortage, so even newer 84100 units earn side-eye until the supply chain is proven solid.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L15886-L15919】

### Sensor & Display Updates
- Patrick fixed a -23 °C thermistor reading on his VESC by swapping in a 100 kΩ NTC and 1 kΩ PTC pair, confirming the stock scaling expects that combo.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6505-L6507】
- The factory Vsett display keeps working on firmware 6.05 builds—NetworkDir confirmed it on Ubox hardware—as long as you flash the GitHub LISP firmware and follow the wiring tutorial; it can share the ADC adapter harness if you still need light outputs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6920-L6920】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9655-L9697】
- Builders priced premium RTV/Trampa dashboards against a €17 ESP32 touch display after Happy Giraffe and James posted ready-to-flash Arduino code, making it realistic to print a custom case and add Wi‑Fi/Bluetooth telemetry without buying €100+ commercial screens.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9655-L9659】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10775-L10783】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10789-L10793】
- Budget dash option: the €20 Turkish ESP32 display works with Ubox hardware if you solder into RX/TX and flash the provided firmware, and community members are offering remote help plus printable cases for anyone uncomfortable with the upload tools.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L12468-L12480】
- Makerbase 84100HPs ship with an integrated Bluetooth radio—the external “antenna” is just the PCB feed—so you can pair and configure both CAN-linked controllers over a single module when it’s working properly.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L8974-L8999】
- Rewound hub projects are leaning on handheld Gauss meters to verify magnet strength after re-magnetizing stators, giving a quick sanity check before buttoning the motor back up.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L19004-L19009】
- Incorrect pole-count entries can exaggerate dashboard speed by nearly 40%—NetworkDir’s GT2RS read 165 km/h with a 30-pole setting even though GPS confirmed ~120 km/h on its 40-pole hubs—so match magnet counts before posting numbers.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L19199-L19203】
- Denis Shelema’s DIY Sunton ESP32-8048S043 dash brings a 4.3″ 800×480 capacitive touchscreen with GPS logging, configurable gauges/modes, Wi‑Fi firmware updates, handlebar buttons via GPIO, and onboard storage for odometer/settings data after custom firmware and enclosure work.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L12929-L12947】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L13089-L13092】

### Vsett 10+ Dual-VESC Conversion Lessons
- Yoann’s customer build expanded the stock pack to 20 S 8 P while retaining the NAMI BMS, then dropped in dual Spintend VESC Lite 100 V/100 A controllers to deliver smoother power without changing the scooter’s stock appearance.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6553-L6560】
- Lacking a native 12 V rail, he now uses VESC 5 V to trigger an Arduino relay that energizes a battery-fed 12 V converter, keeping lights and accessories off the delicate Ignite port fuse that has already blown twice in testing.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6603-L6608】
- Dual-hall throttle setups demanded manual tweaks to the throttle’s start voltage after calibration to keep brake and throttle inputs stable, so expect iterative tuning if you split controls across master/slave VESCs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6561-L6563】

### Wiring & Harness Tips
- Doubling up 12 AWG leads proved sufficient for ~80 A battery runs on GABE’s 8 P pack, suggesting parallel silicone leads are a workable compromise when routing space is tight.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6581-L6584】
- Two-meter throttle extensions haven’t shown noise problems for Ion when using quality silicone cable, so shielded loom is optional for most scooters.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L7164-L7185】
- Rewiring a JBD harness without shorting the identical white sense leads caused false zero readings until the missing parallels were re-tied to the same terminal—double-check the diagram before moving balance wires around mid-pack repair.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6669-L6686】
- Pandalgns discovered that older Android VESC Tool builds lock users into “limited” mode; reinstalling the free 6.05 release from vesc-project.com restored full configuration access and firmware updates.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6825-L6890】
- Shlomozero10 noted that Makerbase 84100HP controllers expect a normally-closed momentary switch, so sourcing handlebar ignitions requires NC hardware or a relay adapter.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L13398-L13404】
- For connectors and small components, LCSC ships genuine Amass XT60 panel mounts for about $0.35 each with ~€15 logistics, making it a cheaper alternative to AliExpress resellers when stocking harness parts.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L19703-L19712】

### Regen Brake Lighting Reality Check
- Riders relying on regen throttles confirmed that most VESCs—including Makerbase 75/200 variants—lack a native brake-light trigger, so you either dedicate an ADC board output or program a spare GPIO with external resistors/relays to drive 12 V lighting.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L7134-L7141】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L7741-L7754】

### Copper Welding & Materials Debates
- The group keeps steering newcomers toward KWeld kits (or Glitter 801H-class rigs) when they need reliable copper welds; Glitter 801D struggles beyond 0.1 mm copper while KWeld’s joule-controlled pulses manage 0.1–0.2 mm with good prep.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L7559-L7583】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L7631-L7645】
- Builders warned that 0.5 mm copper strip is overkill for spot welding, recommending wider 0.1–0.2 mm sheets or stacked layers instead of fighting thick stock that overheats pens and is difficult to cut cleanly.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L7589-L7643】

### Adhesive & Insulation Lessons
- Hot-melt glue softens around 80–90 °C and doesn’t adhere well to cold cans, so Noname prefers it only for temporary tacking before switching to cell holders, fishpaper, or silicone that resists vibration in finished packs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L7754-L7760】

### Mechanical & Repair Tips
- Xiaomi frame owners debating oversize fasteners were advised to avoid 3.2 mm pilot holes for M4 taps—Arsenus reports that diameter risks thinning the frame bosses, so step up cautiously if you already stripped M3 hardware.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L7964-L7978】
- Rain intrusion still ruins wheel bearings when seals are absent; AYO recommends rubber-sealed units that tolerate 80–100 °C operating temperatures instead of leaving shielded bearings exposed.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L13324-L13332】

### Controller Maintenance & Recovery
- Jeferson’s Flipsky 75100 remains stuck on a blue LED despite ST-Link attempts, underscoring the need for a documented unbrick workflow when SWD flashing fails on these boards.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L7995-L7995】
- Builders are potting Makerbase 84100s for rain duty by conformal-coating the boards and adding printed covers without removing the logic board—handy when downtime is short.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L11847-L11854】

### Long-Range Emoto Tuning Notes
- Noname’s single-Ubox commuter is clocking 100-mile rides by capping motor phase around 80 A and battery draw near 155 A to keep the QS hub under 45 °C, while he plans larger heatsinks (or even water cooling) before exploring higher power.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L7715-L7729】
- Rage Mechanics’ Thunder-based RM-X race scooter runs VESC 3Shul hardware on 22 S packs, has already won events against Savoton builds, and is targeting a 170 km/h record run on October 10; race data shows motor temps topping ~112 °C within minutes, so airflow and monitoring stay critical.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L11982-L12106】

### Extreme Performance Builds
- Volkan’s Langfeite GT2RS build is pushing twin LY hubs with 24 S 20 P EVE 40PL packs through 3Shul CL350 controllers—logs show 330 A phase, 170 A battery, 100 A of field-weakening at 20 kHz and only ~3 V sag, but a mis-set magnet count (30 instead of 40) inflated speed readings by ~39%, putting verified GPS runs around 120 km/h despite the display flashing 150–160 km/h on 13″ off-road tires.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18614-L18657】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L19146-L19253】
- Rage Mechanics’ latest customer project combines dual XHS75 hubs, paired CL350s, and a 20 S 10 P P45B pack inside dual waterproof cases with a steel steering pole, SmartDisplay dash, and Hope Tech 4 V4 brakes—a turnkey race spec awaiting 0–100 km/h testing.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L19894-L19899】

### Motor & Wiring Sourcing
- Paolo advises capping Nami motor phase current near 200–250 A unless you rewire with shorter, larger-gauge leads; stock PTFE-insulated conductors look thin but carry heat better than silicone, so confirm cross-section before replacement.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6030-L6077】
- Longyu (LY) manufactures many “65H” performance hubs; Vsett, Lonnyo, Huameng, and Kaabo-labeled motors are often rebrands, and Paolo cautions that some AliExpress “factory” sellers are just resellers despite marketing claims.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6381-L6416】
- Eleven-inch hub swaps can collide with suspension springs on stock swingarms, making zero/Kaabo-style 65H hubs the safer upgrade path for 10-inch frames than chasing oversized Vsett housings.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6369-L6389】
- Pandalgns is running Janobike T10 (52 V, “1000 W”) hubs at roughly 52 V/180 A phase for ~4 kW peaks in a Xiaomi Pro chassis, praising their durability but noting the deck still feels cramped compared with G30 frames.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L18853-L18865】

### Legal & Compliance Notes
- Spain’s DGT-certified scooters (e.g., Mantis King GT and Dualtron Victor) will retain street legality after January 2027, while Sur-Ron-class e-motos already need motorcycle registration; Fiido-style seated scooters still lack a registration path.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L12165-L12199】

### Battery Packaging & Maintenance
- PuneDir’s attempt to hang a 20S10P stem pack drew safety pushback—veterans prefer internal mounting or backpacks to avoid exposed mass on the mast, especially once existing decks are already full.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L5113-L5121】
- Water-soaked Niu motors came back to life after drying and regreasing bearings, but the group still recommends sealed bearings and added seals before riding through floods again.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6271-L6278】

### Charging & Trip Planning
- Yamal’s touring setup wrings about 100 km from a 40 Ah pack; he logged 400 km in a weekend by making two 10 A charge stops each way and now considers a 20 A fast charger the key upgrade for long routes, ideally paired with a spare pack for quicker turnarounds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L19827-L19840】

### BMS & Voltage References
- Quick math for 22 S packs: divide total voltage by 22 and compare to a single-cell curve; memorizing the linear 3.1–4.2 V window per cell helps translate pack percentage readings on the fly.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L6358-L6363】

### Battery Pack Assembly & Insulation
- Builders layered plexiglass and fishpaper as rigid sidewalls, then doubled nickel over thin copper leads to stiffen current paths on tight decks.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L2025-L2035】
- Oversized JBD “100 A” enclosures actually measure ~27 mm once screws and heat sinks are counted, forcing silicone shims and spacer reprints for safe isolation in crowded bays.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L2041-L2087】
- Copper/nickel sandwich debates underscored oxidation trade-offs: nickel-plated steel caps stay popular, but anyone chasing 0.2 mm copper thickness was advised to pair it with 801H-grade power and watch tip pressure carefully.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L2146-L2200】
- When customs delays blocked metal boxes, riders wedged packs with foam blocks or even taped shells just to ride—stopgaps that need better thermal padding guidance before they become permanent fixes.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3051-L3056】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3302-L3327】

### BMS Tools & App Quirks
- JBD’s smartphone app blindly mirrors the handset language, so the “Softlock” toggle and balance thresholds only show up once you flip Android/iOS to English, load the admin APK, and reopen the menus.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L2098-L2135】
- ANT Smart BMS harness pinouts change between 10 S and higher packs; the actual diagrams sit inside AliExpress listings, and miswiring has already killed hardware, so the shared screenshot archive is now the group’s go-to reference.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3350-L3415】
- For ANT tuning, Lekrsu advises matching CellHighProtect/Recover to the warning thresholds so the pack trips and resets at the same voltages displayed on the dash.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L13695-L13703】

### BMS Selection & Cutoff Behavior
- AYO confirmed that ANT BMS units drop pack output entirely when they see over-voltage or high-current spikes—the controller shuts off, and he runs 16 S packs down to ~2.9 V per cell to avoid nuisance trips.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L13344-L13351】
- The group steered Pandalgns toward the 425 A peak / 170 A continuous ANT Smart BMS for a 20 S 10 P P42B build while stressing that headline peak ratings only last a few seconds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L13579-L13617】

### Controller & Powertrain Lessons
- Flipsky 84100 owners kept reiterating that 60–80 A battery and ~135 A phase is the realistic ceiling; reports of 120 A battery draw usually end in thermal or hardware failure (including the Chile burnout).【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3011-L3024】
- Makerbase 84100HP riders are capping battery current around 85–100 A despite the spec sheet’s 100 A phase claim, and NetworkDir reminded Zero owners that the factory phase looms struggle much past 60 A without rewiring.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9084-L9095】
- Jason advised stepping up to 100 V-rated controllers for 20 S packs—running 21 S or high regen on 85 V hardware is still risky even if you disable braking boosts—so voltage headroom should match the pack you plan to build.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9018-L9026】
- European builders reminded newcomers that typical three-phase residential feeds are ~16 A per leg (~11 kW total), so fantasies about 40 C home charging only work with industrial-grade service upgrades.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3288-L3296】
- Paolo keeps upgrading phase leads to roughly 2.5× stock cross-section to curb voltage drop, while PuneDir’s over-shunted square-wave controller started “coughing” between 25–50 km/h after his latest tune—both data points argue for thicker cabling and sane verification before chasing peak numbers.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3441-L3448】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3491-L3497】

### Late-Stage Controller Failures & Guardrails
- PuneDir’s shunt-heavy square-wave ESC is saturating a 1 kW motor and even previously blew traces and FETs; he can only mask the issue above ~50 km/h, so current limits need to match motor capability rather than what the modded board can momentarily supply.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3503-L3525】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3526-L3532】
- Yamal’s dual Little Focer/Tronic 250 build finally failed after repeated 37 A field-weakening pulls at ~20 kW; the group reiterated those controllers are happiest near 150 A phase (~5–8 kW) and surviving higher power requires stepping up to 12 FET Spintend or Tronic 250R-class hardware.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3730-L3732】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3702-L3710】
- Field-weakening cutoffs can cascade into catastrophic failures: both GABE and Yamal called out that an FW-induced shutdown can spike components and “kill everything,” so conservative FW settings plus proper battery headroom are mandatory for highway-speed testing.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3730-L3732】

### Budget Controller Shopping & Detection Pitfalls
- Spintend’s 12 FET controller remains the community’s go-to “budget but proven” choice for 20 S commuters, while Ubox Lite and full Ubox 85/250 units are the practical upgrade paths when customs or budget block Tronic replacements.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3562-L3568】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3738-L3753】
- Makerbase/Flipsky detection routines continue to misreport inductance and resistance by triple-digit percentages, and veterans now insist on measuring motor parameters with trusted tools (or a known-good VESC) before riding—automatic detection has already caused on-road accidents.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3854-L3875】
- Budget dual-motor dreams on G30 platforms still require two independent controllers; trying to save money with unknown AliExpress boards only shifts risk because capacitor banks, thermal mass, and layout quality vary wildly between look-alike units.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3754-L3788】

### Balance Leads, Harnessing & Spot-Welding Alternatives
- Jason’s balance-lead workflow keeps the JST harness plugged in while routing; if you misplace a wire the BMS simply refuses to boot until the lead is corrected, sparing the board as long as you fix the mistake quickly.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3834-L3848】
- Builders struggling with customs delays are experimenting with €25 purple PCB welders driven by 72 Ah car batteries; they weld 0.2 mm nickel reliably but likely lack the transistor count for 0.15 mm copper, reinforcing earlier advice to reserve thicker copper sandwiches for Glitter 801H rigs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L4259-L4273】
- PuneDir’s clamp-meter tests on a single phase showed how easy it is to overestimate delivered phase current when shunt mods and square-wave controllers are in play; he still targets 200 A phase / 150 A battery but the hardware happily overshoots into the 260 A phase range, so instrumentation and sane cabling remain vital.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3809-L3826】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L4049-L4069】

### Cells, Cabling & Supply Limits
- Samsung 32E cells are only good for ~6.5 A per can (≈39 A shared across six parallels), so stacking extra nickel over series joints adds little benefit on mid-power builds.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L2360-L2370】
- Stock G30 phase wires are undersized “chinesium”; upgrading to silicone 12 AWG keeps short runs cool even if tables rate them for only 20 A continuous, as scooter duty cycles and AC drive let them survive bursts.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3381-L3403】
- Range-focused packs like 22 S 11 P LG M50LT builds still peak near 120 A with legacy controllers, and owners are already cutting fresh copper and P45B busbars after front-wheel spin exposed how the current pack sags above 100 km/h on 33×2 70H hubs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3351-L3355】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L13297-L13310】
- Teverun owners squeezing in LY 75 H hubs widened swingarms, plan titanium steering columns, and run 20 S 84 V Molicel P45B packs clamped to ~350 A even on Daly BMS hardware, while peers design 22 S 11 P P45B packs rated about 495 A for future upgrades.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9551-L9604】
- Builders reiterated that JK and ANT smart BMS units are the reliable picks—JK’s active balancing recycles charge whereas ANT burns it off, but Daly remains the community’s “worst in the industry” option despite its availability.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9608-L9614】
- Upgrading to ANT’s higher-current boards requires repinning the balance harness (different JST layout) and configuring parameters in the ANT Android app before riding.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10251-L10258】
- KWeld users powering copper busbar jobs lean on high-discharge LiPos such as the Turnigy Graphene 6000 mAh 3 S 75 C pack; expect ~60–70 J for 0.1 mm copper-on-nickel welds and plan layered stacks like three 0.15 mm nickel strips plus dual 0.2 mm copper when chasing very low resistance, using plenty of flux so the KWeld can wet up to ~0.4 mm of copper.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9956-L9959】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10810-L10848】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10894-L10894】
- Extending “silver” hub harnesses is safe with quality copper—those shiny conductors are just tinned copper, so matched-gauge copper leads maintain conductivity when lengthening motor looms.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10352-L10355】
- When upsizing controller leads, keep in mind that 4 mm² (~AWG 11) silicone wire may overheat around 250 A; riders testing new ESCs are double-checking temperatures before committing to full-power runs.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10005-L10014】
- Parallel battery packs still need to be voltage-matched before connection—mixing a freshly charged 17 S extender with a 16 S main pack tripped the VESC repeatedly even through blocking diodes until both sat at the same voltage.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L13560-L13571】

### Tools & Build Process Tips
- Paolo walked PuneDir through reshaping that €25 square-wave ESC: use a bench supply, read millivolt drop across the shunt, and back into resistance with Ohm’s law instead of guessing with hobby meters.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L2964-L2987】
- Medhi tightened loose bullet plugs by wedging in a scrap of hard plastic, spreading the contact without gouging the connector bore.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L8117-L8120】
- When customs halted battery boxes, temporary solutions ranged from foam blocks to literal tape cocoons—fine for testing, but everyone acknowledged the need for sturdier printable cradles once imports resume.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L3302-L3327】
- ADC throttle pods on Ubox 85/150 setups provide only momentary pulses for the on/off and light buttons (sharing the throttle ground), so riders integrating headlights or main power relays still need latching logic downstream.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9954-L9986】
- Motor winding audits for LY hubs rely on either opening the stator or using a four-wire milliohm meter like the YR1035+: VESC Tool’s estimates can be wildly off, and a 75 H 22×3 is unlikely to top 120 km/h without heavy field weakening, which helps confirm if a “33×2” shipment is legit.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L9965-L9995】
- Nami chassis have evolved: V1 “Pringle” frames lacked neck reinforcement, later versions added a metal battery box and thicker side plates, and the latest “Tesla reinforcement” neck keeps the aluminum-magnesium frame (shared by Burn-E 2/2 Max) planted under big hits—owners report 20 k+ miles on early frames once reinforced.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10189-L10209】
- Community-made firmware archives now host official VESC 6.05 builds for legacy controllers like the Tronic 250R, and the iOS/Android/desktop VESC Tool releases reached feature parity during this span.【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10129-L10129】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10438-L10454】【F:data/vesc_help_group/text_slices/input_part009.txt†L10594-L10594】
