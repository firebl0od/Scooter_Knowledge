# Knowledge Directory

This folder contains working documents derived from the Telegram chat export.

## Directory Structure

- **`notes/`** – Scratch space for initial observations, to-do lists, and partially processed insights. Contains extraction logs and review notes from the raw Telegram transcripts.

- **`processed/`** – Polished outputs ready for sharing. Contains **72 professionally formatted documents** organized into:
  - **`themes/brands/`** – 28 brand-specific dossiers covering controllers, motors, BMS systems, and related products
  - **`themes/guides/`** – 44 comprehensive how-to guides covering setup, tuning, troubleshooting, and maintenance

## Document Quality Standards

All documents in `processed/` follow consistent formatting standards:

- **Footnote citations**: Technical claims are backed by footnote references linking to source material
- **Clear structure**: Proper headings, spacing, and visual hierarchy
- **Scannable format**: Tables, bullet lists, and checklists for quick reference
- **Complete accuracy**: All technical content preserved from original discussions

## Contributing

When you promote content from `notes/` to `processed/`:

- Keep references back to the source conversation so future readers can verify context
- Use footnote format for citations (e.g., `[^1]`) rather than inline citations
- Follow the existing document structure and formatting conventions
- Include proper spacing around headers and sections
