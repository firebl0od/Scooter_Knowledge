# Knowledge Directory

This folder contains working documents derived from the Telegram chat export.

- `notes/` – scratch space for initial observations, to-do lists, and partially processed insights.
- `processed/` – polished outputs ready for sharing (guides, FAQs, wiring diagrams, troubleshooting trees, etc.).

When you promote content from `notes/` to `processed/`, keep a reference back to the source conversation so future readers can verify context.
