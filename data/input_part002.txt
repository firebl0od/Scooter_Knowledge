[2022-04-14T04:47:34] Unknown: OMG seriously... I can't spend $150 to know my times. It's fast enough for me, that's all that matters. Actually too fast 😝😝
[2022-04-14T04:48:34] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂😂👌
[2022-04-14T04:48:51] Luis Magalhaes: Mine is slow now 😂
[2022-04-14T04:49:03] Luis Magalhaes: Back to shunted minimotors 😅
[2022-04-14T04:49:41] Luis Magalhaes: Waiting for fastride to want to talk to me or send my controller they have on site 72hours
[2022-04-14T04:49:59] Luis Magalhaes: Is in packaging from 28/03 to know 😂
[2022-04-14T04:50:54] Unknown: Good luck brother 🤞🤞
[2022-04-14T04:50:55] Luis Magalhaes: If it wasn't @SibClimb i would not even know if they had a problem with something or don't have it on stock to send me 😅
[2022-04-14T04:51:57] Unknown: Paolo VESC sounds amazing. That will be best in class up there with Nucular 12F.
[2022-04-14T04:52:24] Unknown: Paolo VESC with Koxx display .... 😍😍😍
[2022-04-14T04:53:07] Unknown: After having Nucular display... I'm spoiled and need fully functional display regardless of cost
[2022-04-14T04:53:11] Luis Magalhaes: Talked to kelly controller they said that could send me a controller and would arrive in 15days because of the problems with transports, i think fastride buy from them so it should be comming soon to them i hope ...
[2022-04-14T04:53:34] Unknown: What are you waiting for exactly?
[2022-04-14T04:53:42] Luis Magalhaes: Yes should be a good upgrade too 😁
[2022-04-14T04:54:57] Luis Magalhaes: I already paid to fastride and was waiting for a response, from the email , the message center from the site or the facebook messenger 😂 but they are good to customer so they just ignore me
[2022-04-14T04:55:40] Luis Magalhaes: If they don't reply soon i would have report to paypall 😅
[2022-04-14T04:56:22] Luis Magalhaes: And then receive the money and buy directly and wait more
[2022-04-14T04:56:24] Unknown: At least you're protected with PayPal
[2022-04-14T04:56:25] Luis Magalhaes: 👀
[2022-04-14T04:56:32] Unknown: Ughhh
[2022-04-14T04:56:36] Luis Magalhaes: True best think i made 😅
[2022-04-14T04:56:48] Unknown: Why is it sooo damn hard to find a decent high power controller?!?
[2022-04-14T04:57:29] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2022-04-14T04:57:31] Luis Magalhaes: True
[2022-04-14T04:57:39] Unknown: I don't understand the problem. Nucular was on top... Then the damn shit war. I wish so hard they were available to everyone
[2022-04-14T04:57:43] Luis Magalhaes: Or just have to pay too much
[2022-04-14T04:58:11] Unknown: That too. Fuckin bac4000 on endless sphere for $1300... Seriously? That's out of control
[2022-04-14T04:58:12] Luis Magalhaes: And they where doing new box
[2022-04-14T04:59:00] Unknown: If spintend could make a 100v 80-100a batt/250a phase controller... Even single... They would absolutely kill it.
[2022-04-14T04:59:36] Luis Magalhaes: If they put big solder balls they would 😂😂😂🔥
[2022-04-14T05:00:07] Luis Magalhaes: Just kidding, but its true they should do a 12fet ubox 😁
[2022-04-14T05:01:07] Unknown: I'll even take the solder balls 🤣🤣🤣. Whatevs, just know to inspect. Having a VESC with those specs would turn me on hardcore. Paolo is creating one before them. What's the problem spintend? Know your customer base
[2022-04-14T05:01:58] Luis Magalhaes: They think that all of use are good with 100A 😂
[2022-04-14T05:04:19] Unknown: 100a battery.. I agree. 100a phase is nothing in our world
[2022-04-14T05:04:39] Luis Magalhaes: Agreed
[2022-04-14T05:05:08] Luis Magalhaes: I was so disappointed when I run my wolf in 100A motor 😂
[2022-04-14T05:05:47] Luis Magalhaes: It was getting more speed but looks like i had slow start enable 😂
[2022-04-14T05:06:50] Unknown: Yes, it's not much... Especially on FOC (ubox, VESC, etc..)... Stock controllers have unknown phase amp settings, but I think is fairly high
[2022-04-14T05:08:43] Unknown: Stock controllers use max phase amps to reach desired speed, based off throttle request, so even if 40a battery per motor... Phase amps are high on stock "dumb" controllers
[2022-04-14T05:09:07] Unknown: Infineon type controllers so to speak
[2022-04-14T05:10:59] Luis Magalhaes: Yes, stock controllers are like premature ejaculation they show lots of power at start and then 🐌
[2022-04-14T05:11:04] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2022-04-14T05:11:42] Luis Magalhaes: Lots of motor amps and small value on battery 😁
[2022-04-14T05:11:55] Unknown: Haha... Good analogy. Premature ejaculation 😝😝... Good one 👌
[2022-04-14T05:12:03] Unknown: 110%

[2022-04-14T07:34:37] rosheee: Mr. Teh Who @PaoloWu says 15S go so hard blade I think LE
[2022-04-14T07:34:47] rosheee: Not received like u
[2022-04-14T07:35:45] sombre_enfant: Not on spinted vesc tho

[2022-04-14T07:36:45] sombre_enfant: Yeah
[2022-04-14T07:37:06] sombre_enfant: And 15s was on 12mos with some crazy param
[2022-04-14T08:11:24] rosheee: 12mos
[2022-04-14T12:53:55] Artem Bulashev: One of the final versions of the throttle, getting almost finished

[2022-04-14T12:53:55] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3604@14-04-2022_12-53-55.jpg>
[2022-04-14T12:57:34] Oliver Eliasson: Looks amazing
[2022-04-14T13:02:45] Lechu: only throttle ? or throttle with brake ?
[2022-04-14T13:12:01] Oliver Eliasson: Throttle with brake
[2022-04-14T13:15:30] Lechu: <photos/photo_3605@14-04-2022_13-15-30.jpg>
[2022-04-14T13:16:01] Lechu: change only half part from this
[2022-04-14T13:16:24] Lechu: and needed to modify spring
[2022-04-14T13:17:19] Lechu: I was thinking about this, I just ordered this thumb throttle and modify to brake+throttle
[2022-04-14T13:23:11] Artem Bulashev: Doesn’t work like this
[2022-04-14T13:28:23] Artem Bulashev: You need centering mechanism, need centering stoper, need end limiters
[2022-04-14T13:29:21] Artem Bulashev: Otherwise your center point will drift and cause runaways of sort - more like slow creep-aways😄
[2022-04-14T13:30:20] Artem Bulashev: There is reasons why almost no one makes bidirectional throttles and those that do sell them for 120-220$ 😄😄 (not reasonable price)
[2022-04-14T13:30:24] Lechu: yes, I know, but sensor and magnet can be used
[2022-04-14T13:30:33] Lechu: hmm
[2022-04-14T13:30:55] Lechu: but you are doing on one sensor ? or two ?
[2022-04-14T13:31:03] Lechu: separate for brake and throttle ?
[2022-04-14T13:32:01] Artem Bulashev: For no directional?
[2022-04-14T13:32:19] Artem Bulashev: Most likely we will use MCU inside with single sensor
[2022-04-14T13:32:47] Artem Bulashev: Because it will have a lot more functionality that simple throttle.
[2022-04-14T13:32:53] Lechu: aaa, ok
[2022-04-14T13:33:04] Lechu: throttle with steroids ;)
[2022-04-14T13:33:47] Artem Bulashev: Yeah it will be selectable single way or bi directional
[2022-04-14T13:33:59] Artem Bulashev: It will be selectable 5v or 3.3v
[2022-04-14T13:34:12] Artem Bulashev: So no need for adc adapter with that throttle
[2022-04-14T13:34:28] Artem Bulashev: And it would work on normal controllers and on VESC / programmable controllers
[2022-04-14T13:35:32] Lechu: what price you are aiming at?
[2022-04-14T14:23:45] Artem Bulashev: 45-55$
[2022-04-14T14:24:15] Artem Bulashev: Likely in high quality plastic

[2022-04-14T16:44:37] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, Im looking for even stronger than magura for front
[2022-04-14T16:44:47] Artem Bulashev: ? You can’t have sealed enclosure when you have a wheel to spins without making it a lot bigger- would need to compartmentalize and that would make assembly and manufacturing nearly impossible
[2022-04-14T16:45:06] Artem Bulashev: Cheaper to confirm ally coat the small pcb 👌
[2022-04-14T16:45:25] Happy Giraffe: Sounds good, I gotta think about this🤔 Only problem is to combine proportional and switch ebrake
[2022-04-14T16:45:59] Happy Giraffe: You are my bunny😂
[2022-04-14T16:46:39] Artem Bulashev: No directional requires only single adc input, so your switch ebrake still can be on adc2
[2022-04-14T16:46:42] Artem Bulashev: ☺️
[2022-04-14T16:47:41] Happy Giraffe: Damn, sounds good. Sideways wheel can be better than vertical throttle for offroad and road bumps
[2022-04-14T16:48:15] Oliver Eliasson: The new adc board from spintend should be able to do both proportional and swith at the same time
[2022-04-14T16:48:37] Happy Giraffe: I gotta check it out then, sounds cool
[2022-04-14T16:50:20] Lechu: yes. but with @artBula throttle we dont need spintend adcV2. Now only need to know ETA
[2022-04-14T16:51:17] Oliver Eliasson: Yes of course but if you want light etc. i still think you need
[2022-04-14T16:53:51] Lechu: only stop light. because rest light you can do without

[2022-04-14T17:07:45] Oliver Eliasson: Oh nice, they implanted that already
[2022-04-14T17:08:25] Artem Bulashev: True as well, also I think newer ubox has stop light output
[2022-04-14T17:08:46] Artem Bulashev: I don’t think this is allowed to be shared yet
[2022-04-14T17:08:58] Artem Bulashev: They are working on it still I believe
[2022-04-14T17:09:14] Happy Giraffe: Why not? Its public😳

[2022-04-14T17:10:25] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_3608@14-04-2022_17-10-25.jpg>
[2022-04-14T17:10:26] Artem Bulashev: Good
[2022-04-14T17:14:44] Lechu: throttle limit, set with potentiometer
[2022-04-14T17:16:04] Happy Giraffe: True: Power limit mode Hold both the left brake handle and the throttle handle bar, then power on the system, the adapter will toggle the power limited/unlimited mode, after the switching, the buzzer will ring three times to indicate the mode change, release the throttle and left brake. The principle of Power limit mode is to scale the throttle handle bar's input to the L level, ignores the H, M, L state. So set the L level to meet your local regulations. When power on, the buzzer will ring to prompt the power limit mode state: Ring one time ---- Limited mode. Ring three times ---- Unlimited mode.
[2022-04-14T17:16:28] Happy Giraffe: Weird they state it as "power limit" when its "throttle limit" in reality
[2022-04-14T17:18:41] Happy Giraffe: But its cool as we can now get easy brake light and combine two different brake sensors (switch + hall)
[2022-04-14T17:29:58] Artem Bulashev: Wonder how it will limit to 25kmh. Because it requires different amount of throttle to get to 25kmh in the air and on the road.
[2022-04-14T17:38:18] Happy Giraffe: I get to 50kmh with least registered amount of throttle on flat road so yeah bit tricky
[2022-04-14T17:39:07] Happy Giraffe: We will see, but vesc profile solves this anyway
[2022-04-14T17:47:22] Artem Bulashev: True
[2022-04-14T17:47:29] Artem Bulashev: Now that they made apple app

[2022-04-15T01:03:00] Unknown: I wonder if I should use yellow low beam and white high beam together in parallel or just the white high beam alone
[2022-04-15T01:03:24] Happy Giraffe: Lmao😂
[2022-04-15T01:03:37] Happy Giraffe: Police will just facepalm on you

[2022-04-15T01:06:11] Happy Giraffe: They are 12v or?
[2022-04-15T01:06:38] Unknown: Yes 12v and 60w I believe
[2022-04-15T01:06:44] Unknown: 60w for the pair

[2022-04-15T01:07:24] Unknown: Sorry, 25w each, so 2.1a
[2022-04-15T01:07:25] Happy Giraffe: Damn, I got single 20w now (tested for 15w)
[2022-04-15T01:07:34] Artem Bulashev: True 15w is minimum you want
[2022-04-15T01:07:39] Artem Bulashev: 25w is great
[2022-04-15T01:07:40] Unknown: 👍👍 they came quick
[2022-04-15T01:08:00] Artem Bulashev: 2*25w probably a waist of range
[2022-04-15T01:08:02] Artem Bulashev: :)
[2022-04-15T01:08:07] Happy Giraffe: 3500 lumen lmao, I like Chinese marketing
[2022-04-15T01:08:29] Artem Bulashev: Can you please test them by running through multimeter ?
[2022-04-15T01:08:34] Artem Bulashev: See how many amps they draw
[2022-04-15T01:08:35] Unknown: LoL we shall see. I ride a lot at night
[2022-04-15T01:09:07] Artem Bulashev: I wonder if they do 25w white + 25w yellow or that is combined output
[2022-04-15T01:09:08] Unknown: My Nuc uLight shows amp draw, so will post that
[2022-04-15T01:09:22] Artem Bulashev: Yeah but you have other shits on 12v?
[2022-04-15T01:09:25] Unknown: I dunno... Good question. Should I wire yellow/white in parallel
[2022-04-15T01:09:37] Artem Bulashev: Try individually first
[2022-04-15T01:09:38] Unknown: I can shut off the other lights individually 🤓

[2022-04-15T01:10:59] Unknown: Hmm... I need to run on 12v so my uLight module can controll them but for many, direct to battery would be ideal
[2022-04-15T01:11:07] Unknown: Will do man
[2022-04-15T01:13:54] Happy Giraffe: Im looking for a true 30w similar light than my current 15w

[2022-04-15T01:14:58] Unknown: For sure. In my neck of the woods, it is pitch black dark. I do lots of night riding so bright lights are essential for me
[2022-04-15T01:15:00] Happy Giraffe: They discontinued this lol (I paid 30€ back then)
[2022-04-15T01:16:26] Unknown: These are mine now. They work good and have built-in fans but I can definitely benefit from brighter

[2022-04-15T01:17:17] Happy Giraffe: Especially brighter and cleaner on the end of high-beam
[2022-04-15T01:17:22] Unknown: They're 15w each/30w pair. And they are NOT 6000 lumens even combined
[2022-04-15T01:18:58] Unknown: They're actually really nice but not bright enough to eliminate/illuminate the dips n potholes . All I see is millions of tiny little black shadows on the pavement while riding. Not exactly safe at 50+mph in the pitch black
[2022-04-15T01:19:29] Happy Giraffe: 6000 lumens is Boeing 737 landing lights😂
[2022-04-15T01:19:46] Unknown: Maybe need to mount them higher to eliminate those road shadows 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-04-15T01:20:16] Happy Giraffe: I feel you, especially on rainy dark days
[2022-04-15T01:20:26] Unknown: Haha... Too funny. I don't know how they claim such ratings. Literally just pulling numbers out of their asses
[2022-04-15T01:21:05] Unknown: Ugh.. the shadows are horrible. I've bent 2 rims on my 10+.. both riding at night hitting potholes
[2022-04-15T01:21:25] Happy Giraffe: I have mine higher, getting a more concentrated pattern that helps a bit. I only need to see what happens in 10-15 meters and not in 2-3
[2022-04-15T01:21:37] Happy Giraffe: Exactly
[2022-04-15T01:21:41] Unknown: Hmm... That's a good point
[2022-04-15T01:21:51] Unknown: Shine further ahead
[2022-04-15T01:22:07] Happy Giraffe: Same area/amount of light hitting on a smaller space
[2022-04-15T01:22:30] Unknown: 🤔🤔
[2022-04-15T01:23:09] Happy Giraffe: Like a lens would do
[2022-04-15T01:23:10] Unknown: I actually have a rechargable light that I shine directly in front of me about 3 feet in front of the front tire
[2022-04-15T01:23:27] Happy Giraffe: I think I will put one aswell
[2022-04-15T01:23:55] Happy Giraffe: I put some Samsung 35E to this bad boy to replace the china shit
[2022-04-15T01:24:08] Unknown: And then have the mounted lights shining further out. I'll have to test and try different angles. Maybe I'll keep 1 of my existing lights mounted somewhere else and then use the 2 owls on my kiddy bar
[2022-04-15T01:24:24] Unknown: OoO nice idea
[2022-04-15T01:25:13] Happy Giraffe: Its only 5w with a mess of a beam pattern but perfect to put up close
[2022-04-15T01:25:23] Artem Bulashev: It’s shit
[2022-04-15T01:25:39] Artem Bulashev: This one does about 12-13w
[2022-04-15T01:25:42] Happy Giraffe: I was first one to try it, you remember how it went
[2022-04-15T01:25:49] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-04-15T01:25:57] Artem Bulashev: No what happened ?
[2022-04-15T01:26:03] Artem Bulashev: Low output ?
[2022-04-15T01:26:17] Unknown: Yes most rechargables aren't the best. I paid a lot for mine and it's actually pretty sweet
[2022-04-15T01:26:18] Happy Giraffe: Maybe you can use owls on high beam and then old as low beam?
[2022-04-15T01:26:43] Happy Giraffe: 15w, you guys adviced me to open dispute and I got 6.5€ back lol
[2022-04-15T01:26:56] Unknown: Hmm.. possibly. uLight has port for both. Might get creative 🧙‍♂️
[2022-04-15T01:27:58] Artem Bulashev: That’s due to angle. Need to put them higher up, and point down.

[2022-04-15T01:32:52] rosheee: U wanna see?
[2022-04-15T01:33:01] Artem Bulashev: Techically you could alway do that with just wiring and separate button for high beam - loop for low beam and than loop for high beam starts after the switch for low beam. This way you can have like a car - off - low - low + high (not high alone)
[2022-04-15T01:33:22] Artem Bulashev: What happened ?
[2022-04-15T01:33:39] rosheee: Ok prepare

[2022-04-15T01:34:10] rosheee: monday i do the real test BUT
[2022-04-15T01:34:51] rosheee: i've done same route like everyday but now with vsett10+ motors + 17S6P 40T
[2022-04-15T01:34:57] rosheee: same config like with 16S
[2022-04-15T01:35:06] rosheee: but +10km
[2022-04-15T01:35:16] rosheee: and + 60A battery (2x30A)
[2022-04-15T01:35:42] rosheee: XD after 35km i had over 60% battery with 17S6P
[2022-04-15T01:36:08] rosheee: with 16S5P (more mAh) i had 40%
[2022-04-15T01:36:17] rosheee: maybe cuz less vdr00p
[2022-04-15T01:36:27] rosheee: BUT XD vesc..omg
[2022-04-15T01:37:54] rosheee: Thermalgrizzlypads + not mounted 2 bottomplate

[2022-04-15T01:38:17] rosheee: This
[2022-04-15T01:38:19] Happy Giraffe: That's because your are raping the 50G cell with 2-3x the suggested current😂
[2022-04-15T01:38:21] rosheee: Mosfet temp
[2022-04-15T01:38:34] rosheee: XD WHAT ABOUT BMS?
[2022-04-15T01:38:43] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-04-15T01:38:52] rosheee: bms be like
[2022-04-15T01:38:56] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-04-15T01:39:03] rosheee: 2gether with this
[2022-04-15T01:39:06] Artem Bulashev: What is sum of battery amp limits?
[2022-04-15T01:39:10] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-04-15T01:39:13] Artem Bulashev: On 50g ride
[2022-04-15T01:39:32] rosheee: 😆50g = 5P = 50A
[2022-04-15T01:39:38] rosheee: but take peak 150A
[2022-04-15T01:39:48] rosheee: ^^' still 60A bms
[2022-04-15T01:39:56] rosheee: 40T = 6P 180A bms
[2022-04-15T01:40:32] rosheee: DON'T CHANGE THERMALPADS TO THERMALGRIZZLY @ UBOX DUAL

[2022-04-15T01:40:45] Artem Bulashev: So your setting “battery current limit” together 50a ?
[2022-04-15T01:40:49] Unknown: 😂 cell ratings are put on datasheets for a reason
[2022-04-15T01:40:54] Artem Bulashev: Or 100a ?
[2022-04-15T01:41:25] Artem Bulashev: Need to know total from both vesc (setting value)
[2022-04-15T01:41:53] rosheee: ah oh ^^'
[2022-04-15T01:42:01] rosheee: no
[2022-04-15T01:42:14] Unknown: 50w each? Do you have DC converter to handle such loads?
[2022-04-15T01:42:18] rosheee: 180A per vesc with 50G battery max current = 61A per vesc
[2022-04-15T01:42:21] rosheee: BUT HEAT
[2022-04-15T01:42:24] rosheee: ah lol
[2022-04-15T01:42:25] rosheee: ^^'
[2022-04-15T01:42:32] Artem Bulashev: Man
[2022-04-15T01:42:34] Artem Bulashev: Hat
[2022-04-15T01:42:35] Artem Bulashev: What

[2022-04-15T01:42:48] Artem Bulashev: I don’t undersnd you
[2022-04-15T01:42:52] Artem Bulashev: setting man
[2022-04-15T01:42:57] Artem Bulashev: I don’t care of logs
[2022-04-15T01:43:06] Artem Bulashev: What is your setting front and what is rear
[2022-04-15T01:43:07] Unknown: I have a hard time following myself
[2022-04-15T01:43:13] Happy Giraffe: You have dual vesc, both vescs have 60A + 60A battery current together???
[2022-04-15T01:43:23] Happy Giraffe: So 120A batt
[2022-04-15T01:43:33] Unknown: @roscheeee love you, you hilarious bastard but please speak clearly

[2022-04-15T01:44:01] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2022-04-15T01:44:04] rosheee: but
[2022-04-15T01:44:09] rosheee: IT IS ABOUT TEMP
[2022-04-15T01:44:12] Artem Bulashev: Man da fuck
[2022-04-15T01:44:14] Artem Bulashev: 🤣🤣🤣
[2022-04-15T01:44:15] rosheee: but now i see why SO HOT
[2022-04-15T01:44:21] Happy Giraffe: See, hes an old friend. I can finally read his cypher language😂
[2022-04-15T01:44:35] Artem Bulashev: Those cells are 15a max
[2022-04-15T01:44:42] Artem Bulashev: Unless you want sag like crazy
[2022-04-15T01:44:49] Artem Bulashev: 5*15= 75a
[2022-04-15T01:44:55] rosheee: no prob 60A bms

[2022-04-15T01:44:58] Unknown: 🤣🤣
[2022-04-15T01:44:59] rosheee: this with 17S
[2022-04-15T01:45:05] Artem Bulashev: Lol no man
[2022-04-15T01:45:17] Artem Bulashev: If it is discharge it will get hot
[2022-04-15T01:45:28] Artem Bulashev: And you will have even more losses = huge sag
[2022-04-15T01:45:30] rosheee: THAT NO PROB
[2022-04-15T01:45:33] rosheee: THE 17S MOSFET TEMP
[2022-04-15T01:45:48] rosheee: it showed 1400w and 40A @ vesc mobile app
[2022-04-15T01:45:55] Happy Giraffe: I will need a beefy converter, preferably a led that can take 18s would be nicer and cleaner tho
[2022-04-15T01:45:56] rosheee: temp. went to 70C degrees
[2022-04-15T01:46:09] rosheee: but now i see why..the app showed crap
[2022-04-15T01:47:29] rosheee: ok all good ^^'
[2022-04-15T01:47:41] Happy Giraffe: If you load BMS 2x the rating you get trouble
[2022-04-15T01:47:45] rosheee: nono
[2022-04-15T01:47:51] rosheee: it shutdown at 80 degrees
[2022-04-15T01:47:54] rosheee: no prob
[2022-04-15T01:48:03] rosheee: BUT 17S MAX TEMP WAS 25 DEGREES LOL
[2022-04-15T01:48:18] Happy Giraffe: Vesc doesnt like shutdowns at high speed and back emf from motor I guess
[2022-04-15T01:48:23] rosheee: not vesc
[2022-04-15T01:48:24] rosheee: batters
[2022-04-15T01:48:26] rosheee: battery
[2022-04-15T01:48:36] rosheee: ^^'
[2022-04-15T01:48:49] rosheee: battery was very warm
[2022-04-15T01:48:53] rosheee: again xD
[2022-04-15T01:48:55] rosheee: <photos/photo_3639@15-04-2022_01-48-55.jpg>
[2022-04-15T01:49:04] Happy Giraffe: But you know the motor will be still spinning at 80kmh and vesc needs to get rid of the power generated
[2022-04-15T01:49:24] Happy Giraffe: I think it cannot be healthy
[2022-04-15T01:49:28] rosheee: for battery?
[2022-04-15T01:49:40] rosheee: i had to disconnect battery for 10 min and reconnect
[2022-04-15T01:49:43] rosheee: then it worked again ^^'
[2022-04-15T01:49:45] Artem Bulashev: Also you get about 16s5p 50g - 75a with drop of 5-6v aprox - should get 16*5*15.1wh =1208wh 17s6p 40t - 120a max with drop of 5-6 aprox - should get 17*6*12.2= 1244wh
[2022-04-15T01:50:16] Artem Bulashev: So so yeah you get more power but same range
[2022-04-15T01:50:41] Artem Bulashev: But since you can’t sustain that top power all the time, than you use less and gain more range
[2022-04-15T01:50:53] Artem Bulashev: Make perfect sense
[2022-04-15T01:50:53] rosheee: the hardcore dr00p is at over 190A
[2022-04-15T01:51:10] Artem Bulashev: Also 50g you killin
[2022-04-15T01:51:12] rosheee: 61V->57V @190A
[2022-04-15T01:51:27] Happy Giraffe: For vesc, and battery😂
[2022-04-15T01:51:32] Artem Bulashev: 120a / 5p = 24a per cell
[2022-04-15T01:51:34] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2022-04-15T01:51:40] rosheee: why 120?
[2022-04-15T01:51:59] rosheee: 190.86A
[2022-04-15T01:52:01] rosheee: battery
[2022-04-15T01:52:01] Artem Bulashev: Because you said 61a * 2
[2022-04-15T01:52:02] Happy Giraffe: You have two vescs in one
[2022-04-15T01:52:07] rosheee: yes
[2022-04-15T01:52:10] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-04-15T01:52:12] Artem Bulashev: That’s why 120
[2022-04-15T01:52:20] rosheee: but 17S only 5
[2022-04-15T01:52:23] rosheee: 4V dr00p
[2022-04-15T01:52:24] Paolo ⁭: With 40t?
[2022-04-15T01:52:31] rosheee: with 40T @ 6P
[2022-04-15T01:52:31] Artem Bulashev: 6p
[2022-04-15T01:52:43] rosheee: 5v dr00p with 190A
[2022-04-15T01:53:10] Artem Bulashev: What are settings for 17s
[2022-04-15T01:53:32] Artem Bulashev: It makes sense though
[2022-04-15T01:55:00] Paolo ⁭: With 21s7p I was have 7v of drop lol
[2022-04-15T01:55:11] rosheee: XD WITH 1337A?
[2022-04-15T01:55:24] Paolo ⁭: Idk but much ahahah
[2022-04-15T01:55:35] Paolo ⁭: Set 130 rear 110 front batt current
[2022-04-15T01:55:42] Paolo ⁭: Was sabvoton 72150
[2022-04-15T01:55:43] Artem Bulashev: 180a /6p = 30a per 40t (rated 35a continues) 122/ 5p = 24.4 per 50g (rated 9.7a continuous)
[2022-04-15T01:55:44] rosheee: ok
[2022-04-15T01:55:51] Artem Bulashev: So what you expect ?
[2022-04-15T01:55:56] rosheee: yah
[2022-04-15T01:56:06] rosheee: the 50g with 25Ah makes 50-52km
[2022-04-15T01:56:18] rosheee: until autoshutdown cuz 0%
[2022-04-15T01:56:37] rosheee: all time 80-100% throttle @ 25 degrees C
[2022-04-15T01:57:05] Artem Bulashev: I’m surprised it does that much 😆😆 under 2.5 times the rated max current
[2022-04-15T01:57:14] rosheee: me2
[2022-04-15T01:57:24] Artem Bulashev: How hot 50g battery get?
[2022-04-15T01:57:24] rosheee: it even handles the zero10x limited motors
[2022-04-15T01:57:29] Artem Bulashev: 70c ?
[2022-04-15T01:57:31] rosheee: so hot that it shut down
[2022-04-15T01:57:43] Artem Bulashev: You are crazy
[2022-04-15T01:57:47] rosheee: max temp that battery cut after 30min 100% throttle with 10x limited
[2022-04-15T01:57:48] Artem Bulashev: It is a bomb
[2022-04-15T01:58:00] rosheee: it was
[2022-04-15T01:58:05] rosheee: has over 10k km
[2022-04-15T01:58:12] rosheee: but i am impressed with 40T
[2022-04-15T01:58:15] Artem Bulashev: Man
[2022-04-15T01:58:18] Artem Bulashev: You don’t get it
[2022-04-15T01:58:21] Artem Bulashev: It is a bomb
[2022-04-15T01:58:21] rosheee: i get it ^^'
[2022-04-15T01:58:24] rosheee: i kniw
[2022-04-15T01:58:26] rosheee: i know
[2022-04-15T01:58:27] Artem Bulashev: It degrades
[2022-04-15T01:58:35] Artem Bulashev: And IR increases
[2022-04-15T01:58:39] rosheee: IR?
[2022-04-15T01:58:49] rosheee: infrared?
[2022-04-15T01:58:53] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-04-15T01:59:05] Artem Bulashev: Internal resistance = with time it starts to generate MORE and MORE heat as it ages
[2022-04-15T01:59:12] rosheee: hmm
[2022-04-15T01:59:18] Artem Bulashev: Every cycle you get closer to explosion
[2022-04-15T01:59:18] rosheee: i place temp sensor tomorrow
[2022-04-15T01:59:26] rosheee: hmm..
[2022-04-15T01:59:36] rosheee: then i sell it
[2022-04-15T01:59:57] Artem Bulashev: When new IR can be 3-4 times lower than 1 year later (300 cycles = 1500km)
[2022-04-15T02:00:05] Artem Bulashev: Heat up is proportional
[2022-04-15T02:00:05] rosheee: it is over 1 year old
[2022-04-15T02:00:15] rosheee: hmm
[2022-04-15T02:00:40] rosheee: heatshrink is now replaced because it melted in half ^^'
[2022-04-15T02:00:42] Artem Bulashev: Edited
[2022-04-15T02:00:48] rosheee: where the + cable is
[2022-04-15T02:01:14] Happy Giraffe: Don't sell it to a person you like😂
[2022-04-15T02:01:16] Artem Bulashev: That means your Cable heats up even more than battery lol…. It is not suitable for that current heat shrink melts at 120-150c
[2022-04-15T02:01:26] rosheee: it is awg10 i think
[2022-04-15T02:01:31] rosheee: yah ^^' it had hot
[2022-04-15T02:01:48] rosheee: hmm...when could it explode?
[2022-04-15T02:01:50] rosheee: how can i measure?
[2022-04-15T02:01:52] rosheee: ^^''?
[2022-04-15T02:02:01] Artem Bulashev: Put temp sensor on cable
[2022-04-15T02:02:22] Artem Bulashev: And an other on battery
[2022-04-15T02:02:40] rosheee: hmm
[2022-04-15T02:02:54] rosheee: but why can the bms handle that?
[2022-04-15T02:03:15] Artem Bulashev: Battery should not be operated above 60c
[2022-04-15T02:03:16] rosheee: was thinking of replacing it with a 16S6P with 100A bms and go 2x70A battery current
[2022-04-15T02:03:29] Paolo ⁭: Daly no protection
[2022-04-15T02:03:33] Paolo ⁭: Shit
[2022-04-15T02:03:36] rosheee: XD
[2022-04-15T02:03:47] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3641@15-04-2022_02-03-47.jpg>
[2022-04-15T02:03:58] Artem Bulashev: Here is example of how cell degrades with temps
[2022-04-15T02:04:13] rosheee: so it should have lower voltage?
[2022-04-15T02:04:18] Artem Bulashev: 1y at 20-23c = 1 month at 60c
[2022-04-15T02:04:22] Unknown: OMG I would never
[2022-04-15T02:05:03] rosheee: Yah in 1.5 weeks i get new bomb
[2022-04-15T02:05:08] Unknown: 😲😲.. that's bad
[2022-04-15T02:05:41] Artem Bulashev: Go for p42a because this is still 23a per cell and it will deliver optimal results there
[2022-04-15T02:05:51] rosheee: 20S7P
[2022-04-15T02:05:57] rosheee: Soon
[2022-04-15T02:06:10] rosheee: But 50G -_-
[2022-04-15T02:06:11] Unknown: Agreed. You are demolishing your cells and creating a dangerous situation
[2022-04-15T02:06:19] Artem Bulashev: It is great cell
[2022-04-15T02:06:27] rosheee: I know xD but...
[2022-04-15T02:06:32] Unknown: But not rated to what you're using it at
[2022-04-15T02:06:35] rosheee: Then 70A..wow
[2022-04-15T02:06:38] Artem Bulashev: Just you have to use it not like a retard
[2022-04-15T02:06:40] Artem Bulashev: 😄
[2022-04-15T02:06:49] rosheee: But me is...i have to
[2022-04-15T02:06:49] Artem Bulashev: No no
[2022-04-15T02:07:00] Unknown: Brooo .. you will blow up
[2022-04-15T02:07:01] rosheee: XD not?
[2022-04-15T02:07:08] Artem Bulashev: It can do well 90a setting
[2022-04-15T02:07:10] rosheee: Yah but 20S7P
[2022-04-15T02:07:24] rosheee: But i need 2x60A minimum
[2022-04-15T02:07:26] Unknown: Eventually IR will get to an unsafe point and blow you directly off your deck
[2022-04-15T02:07:26] Artem Bulashev: 105a even
[2022-04-15T02:07:34] rosheee: Hmm
[2022-04-15T02:07:36] Artem Bulashev: Man don’t forget
[2022-04-15T02:07:51] Artem Bulashev: Battery limit is not actually Amps
[2022-04-15T02:07:56] Unknown: Please... Be safe. Lithium cells are bombs when used in such a way
[2022-04-15T02:08:15] Artem Bulashev: It is actually WATTS = battery amp limit setting * battery voltage
[2022-04-15T02:08:24] Artem Bulashev: So
[2022-04-15T02:08:49] Artem Bulashev: 48a at 75v = battery limit 3600w per esc
[2022-04-15T02:08:51] Artem Bulashev: Vs
[2022-04-15T02:09:20] Artem Bulashev: 60a at 60v = 3600w per esc
[2022-04-15T02:10:21] Artem Bulashev: So at 20s you will only need 48a battery limit to actually get same performance (same battery limit)
[2022-04-15T02:10:30] Artem Bulashev: Understand ?
[2022-04-15T02:10:33] rosheee: Yes
[2022-04-15T02:10:36] Artem Bulashev: Also
[2022-04-15T02:11:01] Artem Bulashev: This means less heat to BMS= less sag = higher efficiency
[2022-04-15T02:12:06] Artem Bulashev: Btw also this means less amps on phase amps = less heat on vesc potentially
[2022-04-15T02:12:16] Paolo ⁭: More heat for mosfet :)
[2022-04-15T02:12:24] Paolo ⁭: Of controller
[2022-04-15T02:12:30] Artem Bulashev: had that feeling
[2022-04-15T02:12:45] Artem Bulashev: They don’t like higher voltage ?
[2022-04-15T02:13:07] Paolo ⁭: For 20s is required 100v ubox
[2022-04-15T02:13:11] Paolo ⁭: And perform as shit
[2022-04-15T02:13:19] Happy Giraffe: In short for RS, do simple maths what your battery can safely output for continuous duration
[2022-04-15T02:13:19] Artem Bulashev: Oh I see
[2022-04-15T02:13:21] Paolo ⁭: Because higher IR mos
[2022-04-15T02:13:26] Artem Bulashev: Yeah 100v fets have higher IR
[2022-04-15T02:13:33] Artem Bulashev: Than 80v
[2022-04-15T02:13:45] rosheee: but
[2022-04-15T02:13:51] Paolo ⁭: And is already the better for 100v mosfet type , 2.0mR, rion vesc 2.6mR
[2022-04-15T02:14:04] rosheee: why should i get 20S and go same amps like 16S or lower?
[2022-04-15T02:14:07] Happy Giraffe: What will you use on your vesc?
[2022-04-15T02:14:18] rosheee: XD WITH 20S I GO 2X61A AS WELL
[2022-04-15T02:14:19] Artem Bulashev: Damm so they really use best available fets on 100v
[2022-04-15T02:14:41] Paolo ⁭: Same mosfet as flipsky is enough
[2022-04-15T02:14:49] Artem Bulashev: That’s what Adam uses
[2022-04-15T02:14:56] rosheee: send vesc
[2022-04-15T02:14:57] Paolo ⁭: 2 mos will perform better than 1 single
[2022-04-15T02:15:04] Artem Bulashev: 180a / 70a 130a / 60a
[2022-04-15T02:15:11] Paolo ⁭: No ready too haha
[2022-04-15T02:15:12] Artem Bulashev: His settings
[2022-04-15T02:15:21] rosheee: iAH BTW
[2022-04-15T02:15:22] Paolo ⁭: And is “big”, no fit in g:0
[2022-04-15T02:15:26] rosheee: @PaoloWu the data
[2022-04-15T02:15:29] Artem Bulashev: Yes of course as IR in system is half
[2022-04-15T02:15:41] Paolo ⁭: Not mean this
[2022-04-15T02:15:47] Artem Bulashev: Ubox try to keep size small
[2022-04-15T02:15:52] Happy Giraffe: I can't wait to use the Mxus 3k turbo, your vesc and a 18s battery😂
[2022-04-15T02:15:54] rosheee: ubox 100A fw max settings
[2022-04-15T02:16:14] Paolo ⁭: If you have 2 x 4mR mosfet , you will perform better than 1.5mR mosfet
[2022-04-15T02:16:23] Artem Bulashev: What do you mean ?
[2022-04-15T02:16:35] Artem Bulashev: Hm ok why?
[2022-04-15T02:16:42] Paolo ⁭: Better heat dissipation, and power distribution
[2022-04-15T02:16:46] Artem Bulashev: True
[2022-04-15T02:17:05] Paolo ⁭: My custom vesc no heat with double mosfet
[2022-04-15T02:17:10] Artem Bulashev: Larger heat dissipation surface area
[2022-04-15T02:17:11] rosheee: 135A MOTOR PER VESC 1000A absolute max current 1000A ABSOLUTE MAX BATTER
[2022-04-15T02:17:22] Paolo ⁭: <video_file>
[2022-04-15T02:18:06] Paolo ⁭: Got lower temp lol

[2022-04-15T02:18:42] rosheee: Wtf
[2022-04-15T02:18:45] Artem Bulashev: 0-60 in about exactly 5.0 sec not bad
[2022-04-15T02:18:50] rosheee: OK OK
[2022-04-15T02:18:55] Artem Bulashev: Adam wins though
[2022-04-15T02:18:58] Artem Bulashev: 😂😂
[2022-04-15T02:19:10] Paolo ⁭: This is 15s
[2022-04-15T02:19:28] Happy Giraffe: Sucé has a friend 0-100 4s
[2022-04-15T02:19:32] rosheee: whut
[2022-04-15T02:19:38] rosheee: 4S?
[2022-04-15T02:19:39] Artem Bulashev: So super high currents than
[2022-04-15T02:19:43] Paolo ⁭: <animation>
[2022-04-15T02:19:53] rosheee: sry this is 300A max

[2022-04-15T02:20:08] rosheee: 0-100 4sec?
[2022-04-15T02:20:09] rosheee: hmm
[2022-04-15T02:20:12] rosheee: faster than my car
[2022-04-15T02:20:12] Artem Bulashev: My bmw does about same
[2022-04-15T02:20:13] rosheee: le sad
[2022-04-15T02:20:31] Artem Bulashev: Really?
[2022-04-15T02:20:39] Artem Bulashev: What is the set up?
[2022-04-15T02:20:48] rosheee: 4wd?
[2022-04-15T02:20:53] Happy Giraffe: @SibClimb Tell us about your crazy friend with his insane scooter
[2022-04-15T02:21:02] Happy Giraffe: We want a goodnight story
[2022-04-15T02:21:04] rosheee: what year is it ?
[2022-04-15T02:21:10] rosheee: show nudes and videos
[2022-04-15T02:21:20] Paolo ⁭: I think that’s impossible on escooter. Aerodynamic not allow u do this :/
[2022-04-15T02:21:38] Artem Bulashev: I’m kidding it doesn’t do it that fast
[2022-04-15T02:21:48] Artem Bulashev: M4 2016 4.4sec 0-100
[2022-04-15T02:21:48] Happy Giraffe: Wind will be insane, also grip needed
[2022-04-15T02:22:11] rosheee: 4sec is hardcore ^^'
[2022-04-15T02:22:28] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I think so, but not even aerodynamics
[2022-04-15T02:22:35] Artem Bulashev: Physically not possible - not enough grip - not possible to put enough weight forword not to flip over
[2022-04-15T02:22:35] rosheee: tires
[2022-04-15T02:22:46] rosheee: maybe when he has 30cm wide tires
[2022-04-15T02:22:52] rosheee: with downforce as fuck
[2022-04-15T02:23:01] rosheee: and preheated tires
[2022-04-15T02:23:24] Artem Bulashev: Likely would simply flip backward
[2022-04-15T02:23:39] Paolo ⁭: I think the really maximum possible is about 5.5/6s
[2022-04-15T02:23:43] rosheee: i need +/- 5sec from 40-100kmh with 17S
[2022-04-15T02:23:53] Artem Bulashev: Or it is stock xiomi with bad FW config 🤣🤣🤣🤣 so display read 99kmh when you are going 9.9kmh
[2022-04-15T02:24:12] Happy Giraffe: Careful with your words, this hurts😂
[2022-04-15T02:24:18] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-04-15T02:24:54] Artem Bulashev: Have seen ages ago on YouTube xiomi claiming 60kmh on stock controller and stock battery 🤣🤣
[2022-04-15T02:24:54] Paolo ⁭: Need low Kv motor and 30s battery config for this
[2022-04-15T02:25:00] rosheee: and wide tires
[2022-04-15T02:25:14] Artem Bulashev: It’s too short
[2022-04-15T02:25:19] Artem Bulashev: You will flip back
[2022-04-15T02:25:25] Artem Bulashev: Need 3rd wheel behind
[2022-04-15T02:25:26] Paolo ⁭: That’s mine :/
[2022-04-15T02:25:29] Happy Giraffe: Wont go 100kmh with low kv
[2022-04-15T02:25:39] Paolo ⁭: But on mine scooter I have more acceleration after 60kmh
[2022-04-15T02:25:42] Artem Bulashev: Phone ?
[2022-04-15T02:25:44] Paolo ⁭: Because high Kv motor
[2022-04-15T02:25:49] Paolo ⁭: Dragy
[2022-04-15T02:25:51] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2022-04-15T02:25:53] Artem Bulashev: Nice
[2022-04-15T02:25:56] Paolo ⁭: Use much sensor plus gps
[2022-04-15T02:26:03] rosheee: 0-80 in 6sec..
[2022-04-15T02:26:03] rosheee: hmm
[2022-04-15T02:26:08] rosheee: with single
[2022-04-15T02:26:12] Paolo ⁭: Dual
[2022-04-15T02:26:21] Paolo ⁭: But only 60mm motor
[2022-04-15T02:26:28] Paolo ⁭: I was kill the
[2022-04-15T02:27:21] Happy Giraffe: Will be interesting to compare ebike motor vs scooter motor on similar powers
[2022-04-15T02:27:49] Happy Giraffe: Ebike motor has more distance between axle and magnets I think for added torque
[2022-04-15T02:28:15] rosheee: this weekend molicel 13S10P + ubox + ebike motor (1500W)
[2022-04-15T02:28:29] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-04-15T02:28:57] Paolo ⁭: I need buy g30 frame and install 75h motor
[2022-04-15T02:29:06] rosheee: u can have g30 frame
[2022-04-15T02:29:14] Paolo ⁭: How $
[2022-04-15T02:29:21] Artem Bulashev: That reduces torque
[2022-04-15T02:29:23] rosheee: the one i used for LE motors
[2022-04-15T02:29:25] Artem Bulashev: But adds speed
[2022-04-15T02:29:29] rosheee: idk
[2022-04-15T02:29:35] Paolo ⁭: $$?
[2022-04-15T02:29:38] rosheee: IDK XD
[2022-04-15T02:29:45] rosheee: but i have to come to milano then xD
[2022-04-15T02:29:58] Happy Giraffe: Its literally increasing distance of the rotational force so should be adding it
[2022-04-15T02:29:59] rosheee: italian vesc for g30 frame
[2022-04-15T02:30:03] rosheee: + monorim XD

[2022-04-15T02:33:39] Paolo ⁭: I will got a hole
[2022-04-15T02:33:48] Paolo ⁭: Not funny with lithium
[2022-04-15T02:33:57] rosheee: holes are good
[2022-04-15T02:34:00] Artem Bulashev: Kweld is great, just need source that can provide high jump current
[2022-04-15T02:34:29] Artem Bulashev: It depends on battery input
[2022-04-15T02:34:58] Artem Bulashev: Weak input battery will require you artificially try sucking more by higher setting
[2022-04-15T02:35:36] Artem Bulashev: This is very good if your words are good this means your power battery or capacitors bank is great
[2022-04-15T02:36:32] Artem Bulashev: Why you have one hole a lot stronger weld than other ? :-)
[2022-04-15T02:36:59] Paolo ⁭: I think is bugged the software due to bigger wire

[2022-04-15T02:50:34] Artem Bulashev: Adam!! Watch out!
[2022-04-15T02:50:39] Unknown: Unfortunately don't have
[2022-04-15T02:50:48] Artem Bulashev: Your phase wires were not made for 200a phase current
[2022-04-15T02:50:57] Unknown: 😲😲😲
[2022-04-15T02:51:12] Artem Bulashev: It is not even full 11awg, about 4mm2 only
[2022-04-15T02:51:17] Unknown: Honestly... These are drag runs .. I normally do not ride at these settings
[2022-04-15T02:51:31] Paolo ⁭: Big enough
[2022-04-15T02:51:36] Unknown: Way too much power for me
[2022-04-15T02:51:40] rosheee: 4-5 sec 0-70
[2022-04-15T02:51:53] Paolo ⁭: Have too temp sensor from factory
[2022-04-15T02:51:58] Paolo ⁭: Sucé
[2022-04-15T02:52:10] Artem Bulashev: If you do more of those check their temp please
[2022-04-15T02:52:11] rosheee: But test tomorrow
[2022-04-15T02:52:17] Artem Bulashev: Glad you changed phase connectors
[2022-04-15T02:52:18] Unknown: I trust my own temp sensors more than Chinese sensors
[2022-04-15T02:52:27] Unknown: OMG me too!!!
[2022-04-15T02:52:30] Paolo ⁭: Oh yes be sure
[2022-04-15T02:52:49] Artem Bulashev: He has one built into motor, 99% sure it is same ntc
[2022-04-15T02:52:57] Paolo ⁭: But I want compare nuc measured acceleration with dragy
[2022-04-15T02:53:10] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2022-04-15T02:53:31] Artem Bulashev: Would be cool. Because nuke is 100% accurate we know that as it is direct mesurment, raw data
[2022-04-15T02:53:38] Artem Bulashev: Wonder how draggy would compare
[2022-04-15T02:53:41] Artem Bulashev: To log
[2022-04-15T02:53:53] Unknown: I have 10k NTC... One in each motor. NYC displays hottest motor. Unbelievably, 10+ motors have not gotten above 155F or so. Still chilly here so summer we will see
[2022-04-15T02:54:27] Unknown: Yup, had all logging parameters as raw true time data. Actually not sure anything else would be more accurate
[2022-04-15T02:54:31] Artem Bulashev: 8c outside + ferrofluid + short runs
[2022-04-15T02:54:38] Unknown: Exactly
[2022-04-15T02:54:44] Unknown: Short runs being key
[2022-04-15T02:54:50] Artem Bulashev: Point is to see how accurate draggy is
[2022-04-15T02:54:54] Artem Bulashev: How close
[2022-04-15T02:55:04] Unknown: Hmm... Wish I had $150 to spend
[2022-04-15T02:55:17] Artem Bulashev: Have you seen your scooter ?
[2022-04-15T02:55:20] Unknown: Spent all my $$$ on battery and controllers 🤣🤣
[2022-04-15T02:55:20] Artem Bulashev: 😵‍💫
[2022-04-15T02:55:32] Unknown: True true...
[2022-04-15T02:55:35] Unknown: Haha
[2022-04-15T02:55:47] Artem Bulashev: Just go to car guys they always have one per club
[2022-04-15T02:55:50] rosheee: rion times pls
[2022-04-15T02:55:51] Artem Bulashev: Race them lol
[2022-04-15T02:55:58] Artem Bulashev: It’s above
[2022-04-15T02:56:11] rosheee: i can't use my car shit on scooter xD
[2022-04-15T02:56:30] Unknown: OMG, yes... Have a racetrack in my backyard. Stock cars race every Friday night in summer
[2022-04-15T02:56:30] Paolo ⁭: Rion have high Kv motor
[2022-04-15T02:56:48] Paolo ⁭: It’s normal it have less acceleration on low speed
[2022-04-15T02:56:48] rosheee: rion times 0-80kmh
[2022-04-15T02:57:02] Paolo ⁭: But will have more acceleration on higher speed
[2022-04-15T02:57:06] Unknown: I couldn't imagine going much faster than 60-65mph on a scooter regardless of the build quality
[2022-04-15T02:57:17] rosheee: like the zero10x LE motors
[2022-04-15T02:57:25] Artem Bulashev: Lower line 0-25mph (40), 0-30mph (48kmh), 0-40mph (63kmh)
[2022-04-15T02:57:38] Artem Bulashev: Don’t have that
[2022-04-15T02:57:45] Unknown: It's scary AF. I've hit 64mph and was a little scared honestly
[2022-04-15T02:57:56] rosheee: but vsett 10+ is so fucking soft
[2022-04-15T02:58:01] rosheee: rly believe me
[2022-04-15T02:58:04] Unknown: Not with my shocks
[2022-04-15T02:58:07] Artem Bulashev: Agree but that is what matters the most to many people 0-70kmh
[2022-04-15T02:58:20] Unknown: 1800 lb spring rear and 1500lb front
[2022-04-15T02:58:23] rosheee: i tried it today
[2022-04-15T02:58:28] rosheee: it feels unsafe for me
[2022-04-15T02:58:28] rosheee: XD
[2022-04-15T02:58:30] Artem Bulashev: And 20% faster is a lot 1sec almsot
[2022-04-15T02:58:30] rosheee: idk why
[2022-04-15T02:58:40] Unknown: Completely different setup
[2022-04-15T02:58:45] rosheee: ok
[2022-04-15T02:58:46] Paolo ⁭: Wtf if I put 20Kv motor and 23S batt configuration I kill all
[2022-04-15T02:59:04] rosheee: lol
[2022-04-15T02:59:07] rosheee: i fuck rion with my g30
[2022-04-15T02:59:08] rosheee: XD
[2022-04-15T02:59:08] Unknown: World champion
[2022-04-15T02:59:11] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-04-15T02:59:22] Paolo ⁭: No reward
[2022-04-15T02:59:27] Paolo ⁭: No interested
[2022-04-15T02:59:29] Unknown: Unfortunately, no
[2022-04-15T02:59:30] Happy Giraffe: But it will heat more😳
[2022-04-15T02:59:48] Happy Giraffe: Need to put scooter in fridge for 20minute before run😂
[2022-04-15T02:59:50] Unknown: I would love to see your logs
[2022-04-15T02:59:53] rosheee: VSETT 10+ motors heat u much more than the zero10x LE motors (without ferrofluid)
[2022-04-15T02:59:59] Unknown: 🤣🤣
[2022-04-15T03:00:01] Paolo ⁭: No heat with holes
[2022-04-15T03:00:14] Unknown: Not with ferrofluid
[2022-04-15T03:00:24] rosheee: i use ferrofluid @ vsetts
[2022-04-15T03:00:28] Unknown: My motors temps are super good
[2022-04-15T03:00:44] Unknown: I run higher amps than you have no problems at all
[2022-04-15T03:00:48] Happy Giraffe: Hmm
[2022-04-15T03:01:13] Unknown: Can never ride in wet conditions, so trade off
[2022-04-15T03:01:32] Paolo ⁭: Anyway no heat 75h motors
[2022-04-15T03:01:45] Happy Giraffe: Actually ebike guys say with holes water comes in but goes out😂
[2022-04-15T03:01:47] rosheee: u also lower the psi on your tires cuz motor heat?
[2022-04-15T03:01:52] Artem Bulashev: Because they are completely different and have OVER 2 times lower nominal watt rating 🤣, so yeah what else would you expect
[2022-04-15T03:02:00] Happy Giraffe: But I'm sceptical on this
[2022-04-15T03:02:03] Paolo ⁭: With 38Kv winding 0 heat
[2022-04-15T03:02:04] Unknown: 75mm magnet's.. of course. Cannot compare 50mm motors with 75mm motors
[2022-04-15T03:02:24] Happy Giraffe: Then need 4awg phase wire and 400A
[2022-04-15T03:02:33] Happy Giraffe: <animation>
[2022-04-15T03:02:43] Artem Bulashev: True and vent out than fast and temp makes dry fast
[2022-04-15T03:03:08] Happy Giraffe: Scooter is closer to road so dirt amd stuff also goes there
[2022-04-15T03:03:09] Unknown: 🙄🙄
[2022-04-15T03:03:45] Happy Giraffe: High kv motor always able to produce same torque but needs more amps
[2022-04-15T03:03:53] Unknown: We are talking about stock Vsett motors versus custom 75h motors with drilled covers... C'mon. No comparison
[2022-04-15T03:04:21] Paolo ⁭: <animation>
[2022-04-15T03:04:28] Paolo ⁭: Low Kv motor 35A firmware
[2022-04-15T03:04:33] Paolo ⁭: G30
[2022-04-15T03:04:35] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-04-15T03:04:41] Unknown: If course your's perform better 😜 Like comparing Honda VTEC with Ferrari
[2022-04-15T03:05:06] Paolo ⁭: rears up without me pulling it up
[2022-04-15T03:05:36] Happy Giraffe: You have all weight in back
[2022-04-15T03:05:40] Unknown: I believe it does. My Nuc 12Fs and battery would do the same with similar motors
[2022-04-15T03:06:20] Unknown: My front wheel leaves rubber on the pavement at 25mph to full throttle punch
[2022-04-15T03:06:40] Happy Giraffe: Tire always a problem
[2022-04-15T03:06:42] Unknown: But stock 50mm magnet Vsett motors... That's the amazing part here
[2022-04-15T03:07:12] Paolo ⁭: The factory of vsett brand compare his motor with high Kv motor, and telling his one is better quality only because more torque due lower kv
[2022-04-15T03:07:32] Happy Giraffe: I would really much like going for some Michelin moto tires but damn those frames would make total be 1000€ higher
[2022-04-15T03:07:56] Paolo ⁭: Rosche will do comparisons with blade motor
[2022-04-15T03:07:58] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-04-15T03:08:09] Happy Giraffe: Stronger controller and then same torque and high kv heats up less🌚
[2022-04-15T03:08:24] Unknown: Bring it on
[2022-04-15T03:08:35] Unknown: Highly doubt there will be noticable difference
[2022-04-15T03:09:19] Unknown: But he's using spintend and I'm using 12F Nuc... So how fair is the comparison?
[2022-04-15T03:09:36] Happy Giraffe: Controller resistance also plays a part
[2022-04-15T03:09:47] Paolo ⁭: He have vsett motor too
[2022-04-15T03:10:06] Unknown: Nucs use insanely low IR fets from what I've heard
[2022-04-15T03:10:16] Unknown: Then... Bring it on
[2022-04-15T03:10:22] Unknown: 😜😜😜
[2022-04-15T03:10:29] Happy Giraffe: But he can do tests and swap motor so other components are same
[2022-04-15T03:10:49] Happy Giraffe: Tho spintend isn't that much power for high kv
[2022-04-15T03:11:05] Unknown: He also doesn't have accurate logging as I do. I can pinpoint exact millisecond logging starts and stops
[2022-04-15T03:11:20] Unknown: 🤷🏻‍♂️... Just saying
[2022-04-15T03:11:29] Happy Giraffe: So higher kv motor is in disadvantage when using weak esc
[2022-04-15T03:11:41] Paolo ⁭: Yea
[2022-04-15T03:12:05] Unknown: 100ms logging real time data
[2022-04-15T03:12:12] Unknown: Doesn't get much more accurate than that
[2022-04-15T03:12:25] Happy Giraffe: I think it's accurate enough for our tests, maybe difference won't be big afterall
[2022-04-15T03:13:16] rosheee: yes
[2022-04-15T03:13:19] Happy Giraffe: He needs @PaoloWu Vesc to test them properly
[2022-04-15T03:13:25] Unknown: We shall see. I have no idea how spintend uBox (regardless of version) can compete with Nuc 12F dual setup... And 20s9p 48X battery
[2022-04-15T03:13:26] Happy Giraffe: <animation>
[2022-04-15T03:13:28] rosheee: nono
[2022-04-15T03:13:31] rosheee: i use the real deal
[2022-04-15T03:13:36] rosheee: uboxv1
[2022-04-15T03:13:36] Paolo ⁭: I trust only comparison of my lovely dragy ❤️
[2022-04-15T03:13:56] rosheee: io can't mount my racebox on my face
[2022-04-15T03:14:06] Unknown: If you had Nucular logging you would think differently
[2022-04-15T03:14:38] Unknown: Nucular logging is direct in controller measurements.
[2022-04-15T03:14:38] Happy Giraffe: I cant wait for something higher than overheating 130A phase😂
[2022-04-15T03:14:48] rosheee: overheating?
[2022-04-15T03:14:54] Unknown: OMG...
[2022-04-15T03:14:59] rosheee: 135A no overheat vsett10+ wires
[2022-04-15T03:15:07] Unknown: <photos/photo_3596@14-04-2022_04-33-32.jpg>
[2022-04-15T03:15:18] Unknown: 196 phase amps on rear motor
[2022-04-15T03:15:20] rosheee: 10730 ^^
[2022-04-15T03:15:24] rosheee: lol
[2022-04-15T03:15:26] rosheee: u use more amps than me
[2022-04-15T03:15:28] rosheee: and have less KW
[2022-04-15T03:15:29] rosheee: xD
[2022-04-15T03:15:32] rosheee: sry
[2022-04-15T03:15:32] rosheee: ^^'
[2022-04-15T03:15:33] Unknown: Controller temp... A few C above ambient
[2022-04-15T03:15:37] rosheee: i am such a fagot
[2022-04-15T03:15:39] rosheee: but wtf
[2022-04-15T03:15:47] rosheee: i get 10kw with 100A phase per motor
[2022-04-15T03:15:58] Happy Giraffe: Yeah because single is messed up, I would need to mount it upside down. Didnt want to go buy new thermal paste and clean etc so put back as it was
[2022-04-15T03:16:00] Unknown: Your measurements are off
[2022-04-15T03:16:04] rosheee: XD WHUT
[2022-04-15T03:16:07] rosheee: WHY OFF?
[2022-04-15T03:16:09] Unknown: And I'm on 20s
[2022-04-15T03:16:16] rosheee: yes but u use 196A on rear xD
[2022-04-15T03:16:18] Paolo ⁭: The difference here isn’t controller measuring, for vesc is easy to do custom script for fastest log😅 this isn’t advantage
[2022-04-15T03:16:22] Happy Giraffe: Power is Batt amps x Voltage
[2022-04-15T03:16:35] Unknown: Then why use dragy???????
[2022-04-15T03:16:47] rosheee: me now fagot again xD?
[2022-04-15T03:16:49] Happy Giraffe: Phase is just a peak power when its possible at lower speed
[2022-04-15T03:17:03] rosheee: he use 20S (not wanna fck u off or something don't missunderstand I JUST TRY 2 UNDERSTAND)
[2022-04-15T03:17:06] rosheee: and use 196A
[2022-04-15T03:17:13] Happy Giraffe: Lol
[2022-04-15T03:18:00] Unknown: Someone please explain.... There is absolutely zero possiblity your ubox is pulling more amps/watts from the same motors as my dual Nucular 12F
[2022-04-15T03:18:09] rosheee: no
[2022-04-15T03:18:12] rosheee: U PULL MORE AMPS
[2022-04-15T03:18:17] rosheee: but i get same kw
[2022-04-15T03:18:44] Unknown: How? On 17s vs 20s? How is that even possible?
[2022-04-15T03:18:55] rosheee: i get 10KW with 2x100A motor phase current
[2022-04-15T03:18:58] rosheee: ^'
[2022-04-15T03:19:09] rosheee: not even 100A
[2022-04-15T03:19:10] Paolo ⁭: Because parameters can be always not set correctly, and tire change much size when you ride it
[2022-04-15T03:19:23] Unknown: OMG. I'm pulling 200a phase on rear and 130a phase on front.... 330a phase total
[2022-04-15T03:19:44] Unknown: That absolutely makes sense then... I understand
[2022-04-15T03:19:48] Happy Giraffe: Dont you motherfucker still understand you can have 200A phase with 2000w😂
[2022-04-15T03:20:03] rosheee: <photos/photo_3662@15-04-2022_03-20-03.jpg>
[2022-04-15T03:20:04] Unknown: I don't think understanding
[2022-04-15T03:20:14] rosheee: no understand
[2022-04-15T03:20:20] rosheee: but with 196A he should get more kw
[2022-04-15T03:20:32] Happy Giraffe: Battery current limit and voltage is what decides the power you can use
[2022-04-15T03:20:48] rosheee: then what values he has?
[2022-04-15T03:21:04] Unknown: I'm was at 148a battery TOTAL (78A REAR AND 70A FRONT)
[2022-04-15T03:21:05] rosheee: he has more battery and more volt and more everything
[2022-04-15T03:21:09] Happy Giraffe: 100v: 100A battery current 120A phase 70A battery 160A phase (Here higher phase is 30% less power)
[2022-04-15T03:21:10] Paolo ⁭: No mean this, also dragy judge the hill of road , and does a graph of parameters. And if not good values, app will tell you these stats aren’t legit
[2022-04-15T03:21:28] rosheee: aha ^^'
[2022-04-15T03:21:33] Unknown: Completely understand.
[2022-04-15T03:21:43] rosheee: so
[2022-04-15T03:21:46] Unknown: Really awesome
[2022-04-15T03:21:52] rosheee: 17S can go max
[2022-04-15T03:22:02] rosheee: ^^'''''''
[2022-04-15T03:22:45] Happy Giraffe: 10kw and 160a battery current ~ 62.5v
[2022-04-15T03:22:49] Happy Giraffe: Makes sense
[2022-04-15T03:22:59] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_3664@15-04-2022_03-22-59.jpg>
[2022-04-15T03:23:14] Paolo ⁭: I don’t understand if you are joking or not😂😂
[2022-04-15T03:23:54] Unknown: 0-70km/h in 15 seconds???

[2022-04-15T03:24:27] Happy Giraffe: There you see a prime example what I mean
[2022-04-15T03:24:32] Paolo ⁭: Dead time
[2022-04-15T03:24:41] Paolo ⁭: It’s only for example

[2022-04-15T03:24:57] Unknown: So what would be the true time? 0-70?
[2022-04-15T03:25:05] Unknown: How to calculate?
[2022-04-15T03:25:59] Unknown: Seems impossible to calculate accurately unless graph shows waypoints

[2022-04-15T03:46:37] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣 pedro was having problems with copper
[2022-04-15T03:59:24] Unknown: Absolutely... I choose not to destroy my battery, so 10.7kw is perfectly okay with me. I don't have Guinness world record announcer in Stafford Springs Connecticut USA 🤣

[2022-04-15T18:38:29] Unknown: What is the axle width on those? KV? I think I see 5 hall wires, so no temp sensor built in?
[2022-04-15T18:50:02] sombre_enfant: Sucé enough
[2022-04-15T18:53:24] Paolo ⁭: No, this is another factory

[2022-04-15T19:14:31] Paolo ⁭: Wolf x is 50
[2022-04-15T19:14:44] Paolo ⁭: And same look
[2022-04-15T19:16:37] sombre_enfant: "same look" 45mm
[2022-04-15T19:17:21] Paolo ⁭: External cover is identically
[2022-04-15T19:17:24] Paolo ⁭: But this is 50
[2022-04-15T19:17:40] Paolo ⁭: They made 2 version of this motor
[2022-04-15T19:18:01] sombre_enfant: Ait any downside benefit compared to blade ?
[2022-04-15T19:18:23] sombre_enfant: I had 45mm it wasnt that great on g30 single
[2022-04-15T19:19:08] Paolo ⁭: All these motor need strong controllers
[2022-04-15T19:19:53] sombre_enfant: Def true it was lame with ninebot esc started to kick at 40kph
[2022-04-15T19:21:33] Paolo ⁭: How much volt

[2022-04-15T19:23:54] Paolo ⁭: High Kv motor need more current than volt

[2022-04-15T20:36:09] Happy Giraffe: Anyone know a place that explains motor saturation like to a child?
[2022-04-15T20:36:41] Happy Giraffe: Everyone knows its bad and causes heat and wastes amps but where does it come from and why
[2022-04-15T20:40:04] Mirono escooters: Following
[2022-04-15T20:40:33] Happy Giraffe: @koxx3 you are a possible genius to know this😂
[2022-04-15T20:41:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: easy ;)
[2022-04-15T20:41:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturation_(magnetic)
[2022-04-15T20:42:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: more complex version : https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0307904X00000160
[2022-04-15T20:49:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <files/image_2022-04-15_20-49-54.png>
[2022-04-15T21:02:41] Happy Giraffe: So yes too strong magnetic field makes core have magnetization but how does winding turns etc affect it?😳
[2022-04-15T21:03:06] Happy Giraffe: Higher turn motors saturate easier?
[2022-04-15T21:19:56] D J: But yes or no 😅
[2022-04-15T21:42:18] Artem Bulashev: Very basic ?
[2022-04-15T21:42:38] Artem Bulashev: It is when more amps doesn’t result in more torque
[2022-04-15T21:42:49] Happy Giraffe: Yes, but what affects that
[2022-04-15T21:42:55] Happy Giraffe: Winding, core material etc
[2022-04-15T21:43:09] Happy Giraffe: Its like a point of diminishing return
[2022-04-15T21:43:53] Happy Giraffe: And is it usually something we have to think about?
[2022-04-15T21:44:11] Artem Bulashev: The exact relation between all parts is very complex and it’s hard to say how one change will effect, a lot harder to say what result will be if you change two like material and shape of stator cut outs for example
[2022-04-15T21:46:38] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, I see. No clear examples available anywhere, for my understanding those are needed😂

[2022-04-15T23:57:52] Happy Giraffe: Nice, Im just bit hesitating to plug something like this to a 18s battery😂
[2022-04-15T23:58:08] Happy Giraffe: No heating at 5A?
[2022-04-15T23:58:12] Gigolo Joe: I install them on 16s
[2022-04-15T23:58:25] Gigolo Joe: No heating No power drops
[2022-04-15T23:58:36] Gigolo Joe: Never tried on 18s tho
[2022-04-15T23:59:16] Happy Giraffe: If 16s works should be fine with 18
[2022-04-15T23:59:26] Happy Giraffe: Thanks for the input!
[2022-04-15T23:59:53] Gigolo Joe: At 4.7A they don't overheat
[2022-04-16T00:00:14] Gigolo Joe: Same temp as room temperature
[2022-04-16T00:00:17] Happy Giraffe: That's enough, I plan to only use some 40w lights

[2022-04-16T00:03:58] Happy Giraffe: Any update on display?
[2022-04-16T00:05:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes. received first full costing. too much... need a second round. still looking for a supplier for the plastic parts. mlf print tests are not good.for a commercial product.

[2022-04-16T01:27:46] rosheee: i vgonna flash fw XD
[2022-04-16T01:27:50] rosheee: maybe it works then

[2022-04-16T01:28:02] Paolo ⁭: I will share you parameters for blade motor not all same
[2022-04-16T01:28:04] rosheee: at least i'm done with that scooter now no changes
[2022-04-16T01:28:08] rosheee: ❤️❤️
[2022-04-16T01:28:17] rosheee: only rear brake then success

[2022-04-16T01:40:51] Unknown: MTPA really really is not made for hub motors
[2022-04-16T01:41:05] rosheee: nothing happened
[2022-04-16T01:41:06] Unknown: IPM only
[2022-04-16T01:41:26] Paolo ⁭: With blade motor works as god
[2022-04-16T01:41:48] Paolo ⁭: But you should find before correct parameter
[2022-04-16T01:42:00] Paolo ⁭: From 70kmh max to 90kmh max
[2022-04-16T01:42:15] Paolo ⁭: And big performance increments in sensorless on uphill
[2022-04-16T01:42:38] Unknown: VESC and Nucular both specifically say for IPM motors. Nucular literally says, non IPM motors... Turn off without question 🤷🏻‍♂️

[2022-04-16T01:43:39] Unknown: LoL
[2022-04-16T01:44:42] Unknown: I actually rode mine with MTPA for a while. I have it off now and feels more punchy on low end. Nuc guys were complaining they could no longer wheelie on their dirt bikes with new MTPA firmware. Disabled and back wheeling again (hub motors)
[2022-04-16T01:46:20] Unknown: It is specifically made and designed for mid drive IPM motors or similar. VESC manual breaks down the reasoning quite nicely.
[2022-04-16T01:49:17] rosheee: so back to 75_300_R3 fw
[2022-04-16T01:50:04] Paolo ⁭: Bro if it not works with you not mean not works with all
[2022-04-16T01:50:10] Paolo ⁭: Maybe depends by motor model
[2022-04-16T01:50:23] Paolo ⁭: I can tell you sure I have lot of performance increments
[2022-04-16T01:50:42] Paolo ⁭: Without that my friend blade can’t reach 90kmh in 15s
[2022-04-16T01:59:23] Unknown: I'm not saying it doesn't I just think it's interesting that VESC and Nuc specifically say for IPM motors. I'm sure it does have a lot to do with each individual motor. Mine definitely didn't run bad with it on
[2022-04-16T02:01:16] Unknown: It also tends to affect torque but you're saying it increases top speed by a lot? That's really interesting
[2022-04-16T02:02:22] Unknown: Before and after tests had only MTPA setting difference? No other settings were adjusted?
[2022-04-16T02:02:33] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2022-04-16T02:03:27] Paolo ⁭: FOC is a very complex algorithm
[2022-04-16T02:04:09] Paolo ⁭: The really advantage of foc is here, that fast cpu needs for this.
[2022-04-16T02:04:19] Paolo ⁭: Bldc controller can’t never do this
[2022-04-16T02:05:42] Unknown: The negative id current that is injected almost sounds similar to field weakening in a way
[2022-04-16T02:05:50] Unknown: Hmm 🤔
[2022-04-16T02:06:31] Unknown: Like, field weakening for low speeds... or something.

[2022-04-16T09:54:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: plastic, you are right. but injection mold cost a kidney. mlf = dirty, fdm = dirty, sls pa12 = test in progress, resin = test in progress.
[2022-04-16T09:56:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: we run foc on stm32f103 without any issue on SESC firmware 😉 (~40% cpu ressources free).
[2022-04-16T15:50:27] Artem Bulashev: SLS too expensive ?
[2022-04-16T15:51:31] Artem Bulashev: What music 😂

[2022-04-16T17:05:37] sombre_enfant: Trust a datasheet from factory or trust a man, very good question brother
[2022-04-16T17:07:41] Artem Bulashev: Samsung you can trust 100%. They always under sell
[2022-04-16T17:07:51] Artem Bulashev: 1C for that cell is safe, but remember
[2022-04-16T17:08:25] rosheee: Ok my 50G batterypack hit 42 degrees when measured with laser And the frame was 32 C
[2022-04-16T17:08:29] Artem Bulashev: ALWAY charge as slow as time allows you to, or don’t at all if there is enough for next ride and 20% more
[2022-04-16T17:08:49] Artem Bulashev: That means about 60 inside between cells likely
[2022-04-16T17:09:00] Artem Bulashev: You don’t have temp sensor inside ?
[2022-04-16T17:09:13] rosheee: No
[2022-04-16T17:09:21] rosheee: And vsett10+ is so slow ^^'..so sad
[2022-04-16T17:09:56] Artem Bulashev: 0-40mph (63kmh is 10sec)
[2022-04-16T17:10:36] Artem Bulashev: It is better than most similar scooters 1400w 30a controller
[2022-04-16T17:10:43] rosheee: But feels like riding a cloud
[2022-04-16T17:10:44] rosheee: And build quality feels better then my shitbox

[2022-04-16T17:11:09] rosheee: XD
[2022-04-16T17:11:18] Artem Bulashev: 60% are at setting 3 or bellow
[2022-04-16T17:11:20] rosheee: But wtf
[2022-04-16T17:11:24] rosheee: Omg
[2022-04-16T17:11:36] Artem Bulashev: 5 is way to aggressive for about 90% of people
[2022-04-16T17:11:49] rosheee: When u touch throttle like 2% duty it goes peak performance
[2022-04-16T17:11:59] rosheee: O.o u kidding

[2022-04-16T17:32:26] sombre_enfant: If i can weld 0.3mm pure nickel what sandwich size combo i can do cheap nickel+copper
[2022-04-16T18:03:31] Unknown: 🤣🤣
[2022-04-16T18:04:29] Unknown: .1 copper with .1 or .15 nickel tabs. .1 copper equals .4 Nickel
[2022-04-16T18:05:36] Unknown: .15 copper was a little tricky to get welds consistent with my Malectrics V4 and .1 steel plated nickel tabs. Probably could've used the .15 copper but wanted my welds to be solid, so settled on the .1 copper
[2022-04-16T18:06:06] sombre_enfant: So wich size i could weld together i need strong enough weld its for daily
[2022-04-16T18:06:09] Unknown: Also... Copper acts as a heatsink where nickel acts as an insulator.
[2022-04-16T18:06:25] Unknown: What welder you have?
[2022-04-16T18:07:18] sombre_enfant: Sunko 709ad+
[2022-04-16T18:07:24] Unknown: If K-Weld, I would go for .15 copper using .1 or .15 nickel (or nickel plated steel) tabs
[2022-04-16T18:07:29] Unknown: OoO
[2022-04-16T18:07:49] sombre_enfant: Not that good ngl
[2022-04-16T18:07:50] Unknown: Not sure if sunko can handle copper. Don't know much about them.
[2022-04-16T18:08:21] Unknown: Probably not from what I've heard. .3 nickel is super thick and very tough to work with, especially on the positive tabs
[2022-04-16T18:09:04] Unknown: It will not bend or conform to the positive tabs well at all. There will always be pressure on the weld, trying to pull it off the sunken in positive tab
[2022-04-16T18:09:23] sombre_enfant: Its my friend welder he done. 3 nickel pure from nkon, but i've done pack with 0.2 who failed...
[2022-04-16T18:09:50] Unknown: Samsung cells have fairly deep inset positive tabs, LG not so deep
[2022-04-16T18:10:17] sombre_enfant: He weld 40t refrubished
[2022-04-16T18:10:19] Unknown: I have 1kg if .3 nickel that I never used because it was way too thick to work with for my liking
[2022-04-16T18:10:25] sombre_enfant: Should do the same
[2022-04-16T18:10:40] Unknown: Anything is possible LoL
[2022-04-16T18:11:04] Paolo ⁭: Adam I have a observation need tell you, I think when weld copper with other material if you haven’t argon gas that protect the weld point from air , I think after some time the weld point will broke. The solution is use tin between copper and cell
[2022-04-16T18:11:37] sombre_enfant: .1 shitty nickel and .1 copper should be easy and be enough ?
[2022-04-16T18:12:56] Paolo ⁭: I’ve opened battery did after about 2 year and all weld point are broke
[2022-04-16T18:13:14] sombre_enfant: The hot air tin ?
[2022-04-16T18:13:36] Paolo ⁭: No difference
[2022-04-16T18:13:52] Paolo ⁭: Solder little quantity of normal tin on cell is enoug
[2022-04-16T18:14:25] sombre_enfant: Need a video for my slow brain
[2022-04-16T18:14:29] Unknown: Hmm... I have heard some things regarding that. Luckily my battery is 100% sealed from air and environment. I can definitely see how different metals could be an issue over time. When thinking about it like this... Lithium negative and positive tabs are one type of metal (alloy, plated) and even pure Nickel or pure copper welded to the tabs is putting 2 types of non-identical metals together. Are you concerned about the plated steel tabs? Saying pure nickel tabs would be better?
[2022-04-16T18:15:44] Unknown: I remember seeing that picture of your broken welds
[2022-04-16T18:16:13] sombre_enfant: I done two different nickel on one battery and it broke too
[2022-04-16T18:16:38] sombre_enfant: Weld on battery is very tricky
[2022-04-16T18:16:47] Unknown: Is it galvanic corrosion by using incompatible metals (regardless of environment)? Or do you think is was environment air/moisture that caused them to rust and break?
[2022-04-16T18:22:48] Artem Bulashev: Considering creating Modular design and adding some buttons right above throttle! Would that be desired ? (Why not use that comfortable place and add features along the way) If so Which Buttons under Right thumb?
[2022-04-16T18:24:21] Unknown: That's a great idea man. I think maybe a combo of latching and momentary would be great. Will they have a specific function? Or will they need to be set in controller software for VESC, Nuc, etc...?
[2022-04-16T18:26:39] Artem Bulashev: So I explain

[2022-04-16T18:27:54] Artem Bulashev: Yes buttons would be a replacement of top mount! - buttons would be, just that, buttons - you than could wire it into ADC board to functions you prefer
[2022-04-16T18:27:55] Unknown: Something like this?
[2022-04-16T18:28:17] Artem Bulashev: Wow what is that
[2022-04-16T18:28:20] Unknown: That would be really super nice man. I'm in favor of the integrated buttons
[2022-04-16T18:28:38] Unknown: https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=35&t=97723
[2022-04-16T18:29:00] Unknown: This guy is amazing.
[2022-04-16T18:29:17] Artem Bulashev: Oh that guy
[2022-04-16T18:29:18] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-04-16T18:29:21] Artem Bulashev: Nuts
[2022-04-16T18:29:28] Artem Bulashev: But yeah sort of like that
[2022-04-16T18:29:29] Unknown: LoL. Yea. So nuts
[2022-04-16T18:30:03] Unknown: His throttle came to mind when you mentioned that I remember seeing that when I was reading his blog and thought the integrated buttons were an awesome idea
[2022-04-16T18:30:43] Unknown: Super accessible for blinkers, horn, headlights, speed modes, etc...
[2022-04-16T18:32:03] Unknown: Having momentary and latching type buttons will give users the option for different functions. Would be hard to suit everyone perfectly. Obviously wouldn't want latching button for turn signals, ya know
[2022-04-16T18:32:40] Unknown: How many buttons are you thinking?
[2022-04-16T18:33:25] Unknown: I would absolutely love 1 momentary for my speed mode cycling and 1 latching for my headlights. Then could eliminate my modified DDM/sport module
[2022-04-16T18:35:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 1 or 2 buttons, may be, bit since they won't be easily accessilble while riding (need to release the trigger), no more.
[2022-04-16T18:41:14] Artem Bulashev: Questions what would be best?
[2022-04-16T18:41:18] Artem Bulashev: True
[2022-04-16T18:41:43] Artem Bulashev: I was thinking 3 position + 1 button
[2022-04-16T18:42:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: personnaly, just power on/off
[2022-04-16T18:43:37] Artem Bulashev: Neh, def can fit ergonomically more than that, very elegantly - need to re design throttle mount for that and find flat mounting buttons of some sort.
[2022-04-16T18:44:01] Unknown: I think if you're going thru the trouble of integrating buttons, there should be at least 2. I don't normally press buttons while giving throttle, only when coasting or cruising off throttle
[2022-04-16T18:44:45] Unknown: Was thinking about a power button but that might be too close and easy to accidentally press if it's directly next to the throttle
[2022-04-16T18:46:35] Artem Bulashev: Yeah like mode switch / turn signals - not horn as regen breaking can’t be scrolled at the same time
[2022-04-16T18:46:36] Happy Giraffe: You can also have button behind throttle without the ease of access for lights etc.
[2022-04-16T18:46:47] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2022-04-16T18:46:51] Artem Bulashev: Good
[2022-04-16T18:46:56] Happy Giraffe: If it makes design simpler and less accidental presses
[2022-04-16T18:46:59] Artem Bulashev: You are right about it
[2022-04-16T18:47:44] Unknown: I like it. Not all buttons need to be super accessible while riding at speed. Things like power and lights usually aren't toggled while riding
[2022-04-16T18:48:32] sombre_enfant: Think about quick release 😎
[2022-04-16T18:48:43] Unknown: Having them built into throttle would clean up our handlebars from separate button housings tremendously
[2022-04-16T18:49:00] Artem Bulashev: 3 position can also be used as off/low/high
[2022-04-16T18:49:12] Artem Bulashev: Very versatile
[2022-04-16T18:49:21] Unknown: That would be awesome. For lights or speed modes
[2022-04-16T18:49:53] Unknown: 3 position switch... Lights... Off/low beam/high beam Speed mode... 1,2,3
[2022-04-16T18:50:33] Paolo ⁭: New frame
[2022-04-16T18:50:46] sombre_enfant: Ayo
[2022-04-16T18:51:01] sombre_enfant: The motor and battery are good on those bird
[2022-04-16T18:51:05] Unknown: Not sure about VESC or others but I use a momentary button set to cycle between speed mode 1,2,3... But 3 position switch for lights would be great
[2022-04-16T18:51:10] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2022-04-16T18:51:20] Artem Bulashev: Turn signals
[2022-04-16T18:51:20] Mirono escooters: Better find a g30 max rental frame. Beasts

[2022-04-16T18:52:07] Mirono escooters: It's impossible without hacking

[2022-04-16T18:52:31] Mirono escooters: I charge with bms discharge with direct contact
[2022-04-16T18:52:38] sombre_enfant: U steal scooter, i see

[2022-04-16T18:52:55] Mirono escooters: U can get old Rentals legally, they usually trash em
[2022-04-16T18:52:57] sombre_enfant: Would do the same if i was in belgium dw

[2022-04-16T18:58:35] Mirono escooters: Enginereed like beasts
[2022-04-16T18:58:49] Mirono escooters: Thé g30 rental have red locktite everywhere and a 28mm nut to hold fork in place 😂
[2022-04-16T18:59:00] Mirono escooters: And 10kg more mass then regular frame
[2022-04-16T19:03:44] Artem Bulashev: Found low profile buttons
[2022-04-16T19:10:53] Unknown: Nice man. What diameter are they?
[2022-04-16T19:12:24] Happy Giraffe: Are there 14" scooters?🤔
[2022-04-16T19:12:53] Happy Giraffe: Big tire scooter would be my last option not to betray my kind and go ebike
[2022-04-16T19:20:17] Unknown: Maybe even something like this with the proper amp/volt rating? Micro buttons
[2022-04-16T19:21:26] Artem Bulashev: 12-22mm
[2022-04-16T19:21:33] Artem Bulashev: Many dia
[2022-04-16T19:23:46] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3708@16-04-2022_19-23-46.jpg>
[2022-04-16T19:31:33] Unknown: How many of those do you think you could fit with 12mm body and 14mm face plate?
[2022-04-16T19:49:28] Artem Bulashev: Will see
[2022-04-16T19:49:32] Artem Bulashev: Can’t say
[2022-04-16T19:49:38] Artem Bulashev: Need to find good 3 way
[2022-04-16T19:49:40] Artem Bulashev: That’s hard
[2022-04-16T19:54:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: very. most are shit
[2022-04-16T19:55:20] Happy Giraffe: If you make the throttle larger behind the stem. On the handlebar space is limited but not that much behind it
[2022-04-16T20:02:14] Unknown: Ugh... For sure man. Most are big bulky and ugly lol
[2022-04-16T20:20:32] Artem Bulashev: Correct I can do it without any problems or issues from ergonomics
[2022-04-16T20:21:07] Happy Giraffe: Can even make a small line for your 10 buttons😂
[2022-04-16T20:25:02] Artem Bulashev: What you mean ?
[2022-04-16T20:36:44] Happy Giraffe: Behind the handlebar, you can make a simple square shape and just put all additional buttons in line
[2022-04-16T21:20:48] Artem Bulashev: There is no way to tell how ergonomically those buttons will be because index finger does not move left easily and it almost doesn’t move at all so it I have to print it and I have to check how it’s going to fit and where the buttons can be located to be accessible for that finger without losing the grip, because if you have to change the grip to press the button than this defeats the whole point
[2022-04-16T21:23:15] Happy Giraffe: Those would be behind
[2022-04-16T21:23:52] Happy Giraffe: If there are 3 buttons could even make password profile change mode
[2022-04-16T21:25:22] Artem Bulashev: Close you hand as if you are grabbing handle bar grip, now try love index finger left. It is almost impossible So I will wait until first 3d model printed
[2022-04-16T21:27:49] Happy Giraffe: I don't fully understand what you are doing, was just an idea to have many buttons behind as that won't use much space and interfere with using throttle
[2022-04-16T21:39:22] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I’m just saying that your finger may not be able to move left to press those, one button most likely would be the most that would be comfortable to operate
[2022-04-16T21:46:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You didn't play wow didn't you?
[2022-04-16T21:48:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_3709@16-04-2022_21-48-12.jpg>
[2022-04-16T22:02:23] Happy Giraffe: Razer Mamba?😂
[2022-04-16T22:03:10] Oliver Eliasson: I believe that’s naga
[2022-04-16T22:10:38] Happy Giraffe: You are correct😅👍
[2022-04-16T22:10:47] Happy Giraffe: Been a while since these times haha
[2022-04-16T23:44:02] Artem Bulashev: When you hand is in the shape of the handle bar your index finger moves left in the middle, but tip of the finger, weirdly, stays almost still. Try it :) than try open plum like you play, that works well
[2022-04-16T23:44:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: True ,like wow
[2022-04-16T23:45:06] Artem Bulashev: <video_file>
[2022-04-16T23:46:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not sure how you mean but i was only joking with that mouse

[2022-04-16T23:47:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than Happy wins
[2022-04-16T23:47:32] Artem Bulashev: See what I mean 3)
[2022-04-16T23:49:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah sure and probably Happy is able to do that ,banjo ,cello ,guitar players could actually be able to move fingers while hand bent🤔🤔🤔
[2022-04-16T23:49:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean more like us
[2022-04-16T23:49:58] Artem Bulashev: Those are inhuman people

[2022-04-16T23:50:17] Artem Bulashev: Will be a change worth exploring
[2022-04-16T23:50:31] Artem Bulashev: Ideal world
[2022-04-16T23:50:37] Artem Bulashev: 2 buttons behind
[2022-04-16T23:50:48] Artem Bulashev: 1 for cruise
[2022-04-16T23:50:51] Artem Bulashev: 1 for horn
[2022-04-16T23:51:56] Artem Bulashev: Can’t think of better use of right hand 🫱 - throttle & brake on thumb finger - horn and cruise on index finger
[2022-04-16T23:53:07] rosheee: Rly ..yours not
[2022-04-16T23:54:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Other hand ?

[2022-04-17T00:01:42] Happy Giraffe: You only need one or two buttons to operate when riding, rest can be used when fully stopped
[2022-04-17T00:02:07] Happy Giraffe: Wheres the drum and bass?😂
[2022-04-17T00:03:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I think he forgot to put blade music on😁

[2022-04-17T17:20:57] Artem Bulashev: Will check it out
[2022-04-17T18:03:02] rosheee: 5.03
[2022-04-17T18:06:39] Unknown: Owl lights with white high beams. 11.8v input at 3.3a/2 (1.65a per light) and 19.5w watts per light @artbula
[2022-04-17T18:06:40] Unknown: <photos/photo_3716@17-04-2022_18-06-40.jpg>
[2022-04-17T18:06:40] Unknown: <photos/photo_3717@17-04-2022_18-06-40.jpg>
[2022-04-17T18:10:04] Unknown: Rated at 25w. Actual 19.5w. I have the beams overlapping but one is slightly higher and one slightly lower for a bit more coverage area. They do seem very bright but will test tonight when it's dark
[2022-04-17T18:22:21] Happy Giraffe: Need outdoor test, white walls make everything appear bright
[2022-04-17T18:41:28] Unknown: Oh for sure... Plus the beam is stopping short at the wall. Just showing the preliminary beam shape and amp/watt draw
[2022-04-17T18:42:01] Happy Giraffe: Hurry hurry
[2022-04-17T18:42:07] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-04-17T18:43:38] Unknown: Only 12:45pm here lol. Probably another 7-8 hours til dark dark
[2022-04-17T18:43:45] Artem Bulashev: It may depend on voltage. May be they give same amps at higher voltage
[2022-04-17T18:44:20] Artem Bulashev: But 20w is not bad
[2022-04-17T18:44:25] Artem Bulashev: At that price and size
[2022-04-17T18:44:35] Unknown: Yea possibly.. I think they're going to be bright enough LoL. Plus that 3rd 15w light I mounted on the handlebar clamp will shine directly in front of the front tire
[2022-04-17T18:44:43] Artem Bulashev: Try connect Yellow and white together
[2022-04-17T18:44:44] Unknown: <photos/photo_3718@17-04-2022_18-44-44.jpg>

[2022-04-17T18:45:17] Artem Bulashev: 😄😄
[2022-04-17T18:45:54] Unknown: It will pull around 40w each if both white/yellow are wired together, 80w total. My 12v rail can't handle that many amps unfortunately
[2022-04-17T18:46:22] Unknown: The white and yellow bulbs are rated individually, each lamp is rated at 25w each
[2022-04-17T18:46:46] Artem Bulashev: Try one lamp may be?
[2022-04-17T18:49:39] Unknown: Oh yea... Sec..
[2022-04-17T18:50:54] Unknown: Just one
[2022-04-17T18:51:29] Unknown: 21.2w
[2022-04-17T18:53:35] Mirono escooters: We sure it's accurate for such low A?
[2022-04-17T18:53:43] Mirono escooters: I Mean. Shunts are made for higher A
[2022-04-17T18:56:56] Artem Bulashev: That’s yellow and white together or just white ?
[2022-04-17T18:57:44] Artem Bulashev: They have dedicated shunt on 12v rail for peripherals
[2022-04-17T18:58:09] Mirono escooters: Aha
[2022-04-17T18:58:11] Mirono escooters: Cool
[2022-04-17T19:02:33] Unknown: Just the white. Single light, white only
[2022-04-17T19:14:45] Happy Giraffe: Are the lenses glass or plastic😳
[2022-04-17T19:19:07] Mirono escooters: Problably plastic

[2022-04-17T23:23:44] Mirono escooters: We're hot
[2022-04-17T23:25:16] Paolo ⁭: Always more heat than other motors, and with same Kv they have less torque , also short axle . Also their motor need always longer fork opening (in old series) .
[2022-04-17T23:25:56] Paolo ⁭: Hm 3500w compared to 1200w , heat more and is slower
[2022-04-17T23:26:06] Paolo ⁭: I don’t know why😂 but this is their problem
[2022-04-17T23:26:11] Happy Giraffe: So copper quality is shit or? They managed to make less winds than others with same copper thickness?
[2022-04-17T23:26:22] Paolo ⁭: And the owner scam guys
[2022-04-17T23:26:34] Paolo ⁭: He sell 60mm double wire at 350$ + shipping

[2022-04-17T23:32:46] Paolo ⁭: This isn’t a problem
[2022-04-17T23:33:02] Paolo ⁭: But in other motors you haven’t space for tubeless valve
[2022-04-17T23:34:30] Artem Bulashev: Yeah you are about at 30a battery current
[2022-04-17T23:34:37] Artem Bulashev: That’s a lot for this motor for sure
[2022-04-17T23:34:50] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2022-04-17T23:34:58] Mirono escooters: 15 min rides thing was burning hot

[2022-04-17T23:35:32] Artem Bulashev: Likely 150c on winding than
[2022-04-17T23:35:44] Mirono escooters: Problably..😂😂
[2022-04-17T23:35:48] Artem Bulashev: When my motor was 90c on winding, wall was about 40c
[2022-04-17T23:35:53] Artem Bulashev: Barely warm
[2022-04-17T23:35:54] Mirono escooters: Oof
[2022-04-17T23:35:58] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2022-04-17T23:36:30] Artem Bulashev: That’s exactly why ferrofluid helps a lot
[2022-04-17T23:36:45] Mirono escooters: Yea i gonna use ferrofluid inside a Xiaomi motor and see

[2022-04-17T23:45:06] Artem Bulashev: ❤️
[2022-04-17T23:45:27] Artem Bulashev: 30a for 500w is not crazy
[2022-04-17T23:45:31] Artem Bulashev: Mine 650w
[2022-04-17T23:45:40] Artem Bulashev: I do 30a and 90a phase
[2022-04-17T23:45:49] Artem Bulashev: No heating at all, side is warm
[2022-04-17T23:46:24] Artem Bulashev: And 9+ motor is smaller stator diameter , though magnets 40mm so may be volume of stator is larger
[2022-04-17T23:46:42] Artem Bulashev: What magnets size ? Stator size ?
[2022-04-17T23:52:36] rosheee: Yes Use 90

[2022-04-18T08:06:32] Lechu: I try today build latest master, but bin have 524 280b and can't it upload to Spintend Ubox Single. Original FW from Spintend page have 393 208b. And Datasheet says STM32F405RGT6 has 1024kb
[2022-04-18T11:24:50] Lechu: ok, I found problem
[2022-04-18T11:25:06] Lechu: need compile new vesc_tool also to use with new fw
[2022-04-18T11:43:28] Mirono escooters: Small. It's garrebage
[2022-04-18T11:43:40] Mirono escooters: M365 stator
[2022-04-18T11:43:46] Mirono escooters: 35mm magnets
[2022-04-18T11:46:51] Federico77: 30mm,i think
[2022-04-18T11:49:04] Mirono escooters: Oh Yes 30
[2022-04-18T11:49:07] Mirono escooters: M365 has 25
[2022-04-18T11:49:29] Mirono escooters: 500w isn't super good. But i had it laying around so yea. It's a cruiser anyways. Not everything needs 120a phase 🤫
[2022-04-18T13:14:35] Federico77: the motor of the g30 has 30mm of m365 pro magnet

[2022-04-18T14:15:20] Happy Giraffe: Exactly same size or thicker?
[2022-04-18T14:15:34] Mirono escooters: Looks thiccer
[2022-04-18T14:16:07] sombre_enfant: Stator diameter is bigger, on this pic its a 25mm classic
[2022-04-18T14:16:24] Mirono escooters: Ah
[2022-04-18T14:16:44] Mirono escooters: Still good motors
[2022-04-18T14:18:09] sombre_enfant: No
[2022-04-18T14:19:43] Mirono escooters: ._.
[2022-04-18T14:19:56] Mirono escooters: I got dual on mine. Torque Nice and handle a shitload of power
[2022-04-18T14:20:19] sombre_enfant: Still dont mean they're good 🤨
[2022-04-18T14:21:50] Mirono escooters: Ok sure buddy
[2022-04-18T14:21:52] Mirono escooters: Define good
[2022-04-18T14:22:19] Mirono escooters: If i get them for 30€ a piece (tire worth more) and for a Xiaomi frame at 40a each that's considered good for me 🤡
[2022-04-18T14:22:40] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse not as good as your 200€ blabla motors. But for their rated specs and price. Perfect.
[2022-04-18T16:03:39] Happy Giraffe: Free torque👍
[2022-04-18T16:33:25] Mirono escooters: I wonder how my 1200w looks inside. Will check soon

[2022-04-18T20:15:45] Artem Bulashev: Had chance to test?
[2022-04-18T20:16:18] Mirono escooters: Little revieuws tho
[2022-04-18T20:16:29] Mirono escooters: Atleast say wich chip used. So check that one maybe
[2022-04-18T20:36:11] Artem Bulashev: @Mirono_escooters he tested 21w single white only already. I would like to see wire and yellow together if really 40w+

[2022-04-18T22:18:25] Mirono escooters: What is breaking
[2022-04-18T22:19:03] Valentin Holländer: I have this battery: https://scootermode.eu/pl/p/Zestaw-bateryjny-17%2C25Ah-60V-16s-ladowarka-67%2C2V-3%2C5A-/156 What settings should i use for Battery Current Max? and Battery Current Max Regen?
[2022-04-18T22:19:27] Valentin Holländer: I also have a Vsett 10+ motor
[2022-04-18T22:19:40] Paolo ⁭: All frame
[2022-04-18T22:20:21] Paolo ⁭: Noise from rear wheel , bearings fucked already , monorim, much play at monorim due to fucked bearings
[2022-04-18T22:48:59] Artem Bulashev: That will give incorrect speed
[2022-04-18T22:49:35] Artem Bulashev: Wheel compressed under load and read radius becomes instead of 5inch, 4.8inch = 9.6 diameter
[2022-04-18T22:49:42] Paolo ⁭: Then how much mm
[2022-04-18T22:50:07] Artem Bulashev: 243-246mm depending on your weight as tire pressure for 10 inch tire
[2022-04-18T22:53:30] Artem Bulashev: This is 5p of 35e cells, so 10a max per cell = 50a max total load
[2022-04-18T22:53:45] Artem Bulashev: Single motor or dual ?
[2022-04-18T22:53:55] Valentin Holländer: Single motor
[2022-04-18T22:54:24] Artem Bulashev: Ok than set 40amps battery amp limit
[2022-04-18T22:54:43] Artem Bulashev: This is plenty and your battery sag will be okey (around 6v)
[2022-04-18T22:55:36] Valentin Holländer: So if i increase bettery amp i get higher top speed?
[2022-04-18T22:55:41] Artem Bulashev: It can do battery amp limit 50a but I don’t advise it - it silo ups only effect acceleration above 35kmh and not too much
[2022-04-18T22:55:49] Valentin Holländer: Or is it motor current max that gives more top speed?
[2022-04-18T22:55:50] Artem Bulashev: Not much no
[2022-04-18T22:56:25] Artem Bulashev: With higher amp battery limit you will simply get you max speed abit closer to the motor speed in the air
[2022-04-18T22:56:26] Paolo ⁭: 35E 14A max
[2022-04-18T22:56:35] Artem Bulashev: They suck after 10amp, they are best cell on the market in 18650 up to 8amp load = 40amps
[2022-04-18T22:57:42] Artem Bulashev: Sag will be about 9v at 10a load =50a, that’s too much in my book normally, and not a lot of Gains unless you really want to get even better acceleration 35-60kmh than on 40amps setting
[2022-04-18T22:58:32] Valentin Holländer: Okey so i go for 40 amps battery limit, what about Motor current max?
[2022-04-18T22:59:00] Artem Bulashev: Go for max your vesc can do 150a is good for this motor, absolute 180a. Without temp sensor I would not push it further, specially in single motor config
[2022-04-18T23:00:07] Artem Bulashev: May be even 140a phase and 170a absolute. Than test that if it is enough for you.
[2022-04-18T23:01:25] Valentin Holländer: Thx for the help! I just whant to go so fast i can without burn anything xD
[2022-04-18T23:01:43] Valentin Holländer: <photos/photo_3758@18-04-2022_23-01-43.jpg>
[2022-04-18T23:01:47] Valentin Holländer: This is my Vesc
[2022-04-18T23:02:04] Valentin Holländer: I try 150A and absolute 180A then?
[2022-04-18T23:02:17] Artem Bulashev: Above that I would advice to get ferrofluid and add temp sensor into the motor. It may be able to handle 170a phase and 200a absolute in summer without going over 85c (with ferrofluid that’s the limit, without limit is 95c start - 105c end)
[2022-04-18T23:02:35] Artem Bulashev: This but single motor ?
[2022-04-18T23:02:46] Valentin Holländer: Yepp
[2022-04-18T23:02:57] Artem Bulashev: Start with 140a phase and 170a absolute for now
[2022-04-18T23:03:05] Artem Bulashev: To be safe
[2022-04-18T23:03:16] Valentin Holländer: Okey thx!
[2022-04-18T23:03:19] Artem Bulashev: That is likely be enough
[2022-04-18T23:03:41] Artem Bulashev: If not you text here will help :) it can do more
[2022-04-18T23:04:19] Valentin Holländer: Perfect! Should i buy one more Vsett 10+ motor for awd? More speed?
[2022-04-18T23:04:52] Artem Bulashev: You will get abit more speed - similar effect as loading more amps onto one motor
[2022-04-18T23:05:11] Artem Bulashev: But you will not go above free-air speed that motor spins
[2022-04-18T23:05:24] Artem Bulashev: That requires higher battery voltage
[2022-04-18T23:05:45] Artem Bulashev: Or field weakening - better only use with temp sensor in the wheel
[2022-04-18T23:06:03] Artem Bulashev: Your top speed should be already 70kmh at least I think
[2022-04-18T23:06:16] Artem Bulashev: Depending on your weight
[2022-04-18T23:06:32] Valentin Holländer: Cool! 65 kg xD
[2022-04-18T23:06:50] Artem Bulashev: Yeap than above 70kmh already likely with single motor on 16s
[2022-04-18T23:06:55] Artem Bulashev: Full charge
[2022-04-18T23:08:23] Valentin Holländer: So what should you suggest for my next upgrade? One more motor or new battery?
[2022-04-18T23:08:50] Artem Bulashev: Depends what you will be missing
[2022-04-18T23:08:59] Artem Bulashev: Suspention is must have at those speeds
[2022-04-18T23:09:07] Artem Bulashev: What scooter you have ?
[2022-04-18T23:09:12] Artem Bulashev: M365?
[2022-04-18T23:09:16] Valentin Holländer: Yepp pro
[2022-04-18T23:09:27] Valentin Holländer: And suspention in front
[2022-04-18T23:09:30] Valentin Holländer: not in back
[2022-04-18T23:09:37] Valentin Holländer: Monorim
[2022-04-18T23:10:10] Artem Bulashev: Monorim should make it stable due to of centering the wheel hub, thats good
[2022-04-18T23:10:14] Artem Bulashev: Not sure
[2022-04-18T23:10:21] Artem Bulashev: I don’t like that frame
[2022-04-18T23:10:36] Valentin Holländer: Same here, but no one is selling only frames xD
[2022-04-18T23:10:47] Valentin Holländer: Would like to buy a vsett frame
[2022-04-18T23:10:59] Artem Bulashev: Too many things required to mod that total cost is more than scooter with those options from factory
[2022-04-18T23:11:28] Artem Bulashev: Those don’t exist unfortunately for sale at the moment, I have other people asking me as well
[2022-04-18T23:11:46] Artem Bulashev: Disk breaks for sure must have
[2022-04-18T23:13:01] Valentin Holländer: What disk breaks you recommend for M365 pro?
[2022-04-18T23:13:05] sombre_enfant: <animation>
[2022-04-18T23:13:53] Valentin Holländer: I get an error "The following parameters were truncated becuse they were beyond the hardware limits: Motor Current Max"
[2022-04-18T23:14:10] Paolo ⁭: You’ve limited firmware
[2022-04-18T23:14:11] Artem Bulashev: Sorry not an expert. Well 10+ motor has the mount already so get something like Shimano rt-66 at least or similar sram
[2022-04-18T23:14:15] Paolo ⁭: Max 135 then
[2022-04-18T23:14:30] Artem Bulashev: Nutt are good for price if you need brake kit
[2022-04-18T23:15:01] Artem Bulashev: Yeah than 135a phase current max.
[2022-04-18T23:15:25] Valentin Holländer: Okey that works!
[2022-04-18T23:15:26] Artem Bulashev: Absolute I don’t remember what is max 160-180
[2022-04-18T23:15:49] Valentin Holländer: 170 works
[2022-04-18T23:15:54] Artem Bulashev: Great
[2022-04-18T23:16:04] Valentin Holländer: Max current regen? -15?
[2022-04-18T23:16:06] Artem Bulashev: That enough
[2022-04-18T23:16:19] Happy Giraffe: That will make motors bit more efficient as the energy is used more to produce torque than heat but I bet difference is too small to be worth it
[2022-04-18T23:16:44] Artem Bulashev: Max current motor regen try -40 and max battery regen try - 17a
[2022-04-18T23:16:45] Happy Giraffe: Could be useful on startup tho as you can have lots of start phase current even with 40A battery
[2022-04-18T23:17:14] Valentin Holländer: Hmm -17? Can my battery handle that? :/
[2022-04-18T23:17:17] sombre_enfant: Regen is about brake right ?
[2022-04-18T23:17:31] Artem Bulashev: Yea your battery can handle -1C
[2022-04-18T23:17:54] Valentin Holländer: -17? xD
[2022-04-18T23:18:53] Artem Bulashev: -17.5a is maximum good battery regen you can have
[2022-04-18T23:19:09] Artem Bulashev: Some people will set it higher. I would not recommend for sure
[2022-04-18T23:22:05] Valentin Holländer: Okey thx i go for Battery Current Max Regen = -15A
[2022-04-18T23:22:25] Valentin Holländer: And Motor Current Max Brake = -40A

[2022-04-18T23:26:37] Artem Bulashev: Looks good
[2022-04-18T23:26:56] Artem Bulashev: Now don’t forget to configure motor correctly to show your speed right
[2022-04-18T23:27:24] Artem Bulashev: Has 30 magnet poles (not pairs)
[2022-04-18T23:28:53] Valentin Holländer: <photos/photo_3761@18-04-2022_23-28-53.jpg>
[2022-04-18T23:28:59] Valentin Holländer: This ok?
[2022-04-18T23:29:10] Artem Bulashev: 243-246mm should give correct speed. Keep tire at 50PSI if it is Touvt or HOTA. CST 10x3 a lot better tire - 47PSI recommended PMT is like sport performance tire but it costs 100€ lol 45PSI recommended
[2022-04-18T23:29:29] Artem Bulashev: Yes looks good
[2022-04-18T23:29:54] Valentin Holländer: Thx so much for the help!
[2022-04-18T23:30:10] Valentin Holländer: Anything else i should change?

[2022-04-18T23:31:56] Valentin Holländer: <photos/photo_3763@18-04-2022_23-31-56.jpg>
[2022-04-18T23:32:18] Valentin Holländer: Minimum current 0.05A ok?
[2022-04-18T23:32:27] Valentin Holländer: Why not 0A? :/
[2022-04-18T23:32:35] Valentin Holländer: Will it turn off then?
[2022-04-19T00:03:06] Unknown: So 35E have a 1C Mac charge rate? I've always been so focused on discharge, I never really looked into 48X charge rate (for Regen). I pretty much always slow charge and haven't been using my Regen lever much at all. @artBula do you know 48X safe charge rate per cell? I can figure out the math for Regen from there 😉
[2022-04-19T00:06:05] Artem Bulashev: Li ion generally speaking should not be charged too fast
[2022-04-19T00:06:22] Artem Bulashev: Degradation from fast charging is a lot higher than from discharging
[2022-04-19T00:08:14] Artem Bulashev: So 1C is about max reasonable regeneration (short term). As for charger (long term) use lowest amps your time allows - FAST charger I would consider 0.33C = 3h empty to full (like when you forgot you will have to go in a few hours and scooter is not charged enough) 0.5C = 2h empty to full /extreme case like charging in restaurant during lunch stop
[2022-04-19T00:14:15] Happy Giraffe: Afterall charging makes a hefty chemical reaction😳
[2022-04-19T00:16:05] Happy Giraffe: But always having two chargers is nice, one for really slow overnight charge + one for 5x as fast top up
[2022-04-19T00:34:44] Artem Bulashev: Yeah absolutely
[2022-04-19T00:36:07] Luis Magalhaes: i have 3
[2022-04-19T00:36:14] Luis Magalhaes: slow chargers
[2022-04-19T00:36:15] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2022-04-19T00:36:26] Luis Magalhaes: two came with the scooter
[2022-04-19T00:36:49] Luis Magalhaes: the other i buy from bangood and they said 5A charger it charges at 3A
[2022-04-19T00:36:54] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2022-04-19T01:17:39] Unknown: Gotcha, thanks man. Fully agree. I charge super slow, usually 3-5a on 43ah, so around .08-.12C I have my battery Regen setting on 9a and Regen phase on like 40F/50R. For some reason when I have 9a set for battery Regen amps on each motor, the display never goes/shows above -9a total. I think it uses the highest value, so it's not 9a x 2. I still need to fine tune the Regen settings but honestly, I rarely use it since Nutt brakes are generally all I need in most situations. I ride on country roads, so I know we'll before I'll actually need to stop or slow down. Maybe city riding would have different braking habits 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-04-19T01:44:52] rosheee: good night
[2022-04-19T02:06:43] Artem Bulashev: good night to you too 🙂
[2022-04-19T06:38:47] Oliver Eliasson: When you get Curve throttle i think you Will start to use regen allot more. I almost only use regen and only touch my mechanical brakes when I need to stop fast

[2022-04-19T18:37:00] Artem Bulashev: 👍👍
[2022-04-19T18:37:05] Artem Bulashev: nice
[2022-04-19T18:37:23] Artem Bulashev: with new design of split boards that is nice and easy swap can be
[2022-04-19T18:46:42] Happy Giraffe: So theres another vesc design going in the group?😳
[2022-04-19T18:46:59] Happy Giraffe: Raphael and Paolo both are making one?
[2022-04-19T18:54:29] Paolo ⁭: What will be vesc specs?
[2022-04-19T18:54:50] Paolo ⁭: I’m not delevoper, I just sell and manage production xd
[2022-04-19T19:09:51] Artem Bulashev: As I understand main difficulty is Logic side, so power side adapting for ubox may be great idea.
[2022-04-19T19:22:26] Paolo ⁭: Easyeda?
[2022-04-19T19:25:00] Unknown: 24F ❤️ I run dual Nucular 12F 150a batt/250a phase max per motor/controller. Their 3 different controllers (6F, 12F, 24F) use high quality low mohm fets which are essential to keeping temps in check. Running each of my 12F's around 75a batt/200a phase (rear), they barely get warm but also externally mounted
[2022-04-19T19:26:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no, this issue is really not with the logic side. every starts with mosfets controls and current feedbacks from my point of view (gate drivers choice, mosfets packages vs dissipations, tracks sizes and paths...)
[2022-04-19T19:41:23] Paolo ⁭: Not mine, is of my friend, is 12F each controller to220

[2022-04-19T19:49:02] rosheee: The nucular,
[2022-04-19T19:49:28] Happy Giraffe: Cheap and single design is a win no? Easiest to repair?
[2022-04-19T19:50:15] rosheee: Which what ?
[2022-04-19T19:50:16] Happy Giraffe: Yeah haha, I think I spend max 350€ for the vesc
[2022-04-19T19:50:26] rosheee: Dual ubox
[2022-04-19T19:50:48] Happy Giraffe: I use one motor with ebike, need strong single vesc 200A phase 100A batt

[2022-04-19T19:57:00] Face de Pin Sucé: nespresso
[2022-04-19T19:57:22] Unknown: Custom VESC would be great. But there is no such thing right now, so we can go back and forth all day LoL
[2022-04-19T19:57:53] Unknown: I'm not saying VESC software is bad... It's great. Unfortunately hardware options suck big dicks for high output
[2022-04-19T20:01:05] Happy Giraffe: I'm just amazed my vesc hasnt exploded in 8 months😂
[2022-04-19T20:01:15] Happy Giraffe: Flisky erhhmmmm
[2022-04-19T20:02:39] Unknown: 👍 ok 🤓
[2022-04-19T20:04:21] rosheee: Lol there are xD BESC FOR EXMPL.
[2022-04-19T20:04:31] rosheee: 400A 200V
[2022-04-19T20:05:20] rosheee: There are various custom vescs open source to build at home
[2022-04-19T20:05:25] rosheee: Blueprints everything
[2022-04-19T20:05:34] rosheee: So not 12months++ waiting time and cheaper
[2022-04-19T20:05:41] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-04-19T20:07:48] Unknown: I know there are but nothing anyone can just buy
[2022-04-19T20:08:26] Unknown: If they're were, wouldn't everyone on this chat have one instead of trying to squeeze every ounce out of ubox??
[2022-04-19T20:09:46] Unknown: This is VESC chat. Who here has custom 400a VESC installed and running?
[2022-04-19T20:11:23] rosheee: Not yet
[2022-04-19T20:11:30] rosheee: But soon custom cooled
[2022-04-19T20:11:56] rosheee: Have no time for it atm
[2022-04-19T20:12:00] Paolo ⁭: This is nucular seems
[2022-04-19T20:12:05] rosheee: When get kaaboo fun begins
[2022-04-19T20:12:38] rosheee: But for what 400A?
[2022-04-19T20:12:50] Unknown: You said 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-04-19T20:13:47] rosheee: Yah i mean u do more amps than me and had less peak than i had eith 17S ^^' and less top speed driven
[2022-04-19T20:14:04] rosheee: But i know there can go more
[2022-04-19T20:14:11] Paolo ⁭: Yea when get g30 too
[2022-04-19T20:14:18] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-04-19T20:14:55] Paolo ⁭: 😂
[2022-04-19T20:14:58] rosheee: Next week i can send
[2022-04-19T20:15:05] Paolo ⁭: It’s curious nucular
[2022-04-19T20:15:14] Paolo ⁭: I would try buy one and open
[2022-04-19T20:17:28] Unknown: The display is heated if you want to turn the heating function on
[2022-04-19T20:17:57] Unknown: If you're dogging Nucular, you obviously have no idea what you're talking about.
[2022-04-19T20:18:10] Mirono escooters: It's smart
[2022-04-19T20:18:55] Unknown: If you had to ask if Nucular is VESC based, you really have no business making comments to be honest 🤣🤣
[2022-04-19T20:19:27] Unknown: That means you know absolutely nothing about them.
[2022-04-19T20:19:37] Unknown: Then don't 🤓
[2022-04-19T20:20:32] Unknown: You asked what guys were running for controllers and I told you, end of story. You're the one ranting on about it
[2022-04-19T20:20:40] Unknown: 🤣🤣🤣
[2022-04-19T20:21:21] Unknown: It has it's own display.
[2022-04-19T20:21:30] Unknown: I'm not wrong
[2022-04-19T20:22:29] Unknown: You just go off the deep end dissing something you know nothing about. Sort of silly don't ya think?
[2022-04-19T20:23:10] Mirono escooters: Vesc group, what's thé Endless discussion about a random Controller about..
[2022-04-19T20:23:50] Mirono escooters: People use what they like. No Point in discussing
[2022-04-19T20:34:12] Unknown: Exactly. I don't use VESC but am a part of this group for a while and like to think I contribute positively to the discussions and bring another point of view and system to the talks... Not to say one is better or worse... Because it's not about that. When people make uneducated comments, it's hard to not say anything or correct them. If roschee and Raphael want to dis and laugh about things they know nothing about, that's cool 😎
[2022-04-19T20:34:48] Mirono escooters: Then let them be :)
[2022-04-19T20:37:11] Unknown: 👌😊
[2022-04-19T20:59:55] rosheee: I sell 1x ubox 75V v2 new cutted mounts, thermalgrizzly pads and took color off

[2022-04-19T21:01:18] rosheee: It is unused
[2022-04-19T21:02:04] rosheee: Idk xD 250 or 270 Incl. Hxt6mm and xt90
[2022-04-19T21:08:52] Paolo ⁭: it's impossible to say if not have to reverse binary
[2022-04-19T21:09:32] Unknown: Their, hardware, firmware/software and levcan canbus protocols are 100% proprietary, has nothing in common with VESC at all.
[2022-04-19T21:12:47] Paolo ⁭: i have not interesting to know this, but nobody can says this without reverse
[2022-04-19T21:13:40] Paolo ⁭: vesc is great because open source
[2022-04-19T21:14:23] Paolo ⁭: and anyone can made custom products with vesc integrations
[2022-04-19T21:15:14] Paolo ⁭: oh i'm not say this, but it's intersting compare them
[2022-04-19T21:18:52] Paolo ⁭: but anyway russia is good because no punish anyway xd

[2022-04-19T21:27:27] Oliver Eliasson: james
[2022-04-19T21:29:34] Oliver Eliasson: @Foujiwara If i understand correct you are making a new board that replaces the one in the ubox? For higher amps at less heat. And also making display? What price are you targeting for ubox upgrade? And what price for display?
[2022-04-19T21:30:52] sombre_enfant: It burn the board on flipsky 75100😭
[2022-04-19T21:33:19] Oliver Eliasson: But for people that already has ubox some units maybe will be available?
[2022-04-19T21:36:48] Mirono escooters: Rlly?'
[2022-04-19T21:47:27] rosheee: Omg no
[2022-04-19T21:56:52] rosheee: Also selling 2x new vsett 10+ motors
[2022-04-19T22:09:13] Gigolo Joe: They run on the same processor
[2022-04-19T22:21:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: doesn't mean it doesn't use any part of vesc firmware.
[2022-04-19T22:24:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: oh ? really ? stm32f405rgt6 ?
[2022-04-19T22:26:50] Gigolo Joe: Yep, at least the nuc 12f is
[2022-04-19T22:34:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok thanks for the info 👍
[2022-04-19T22:38:26] Unknown: Honestly I have no idea. They built their hardware and firmwares originally in 2015 era, have incorporated many firmware upgrades over the years, so I'm not really sure what their code entails
[2022-04-19T22:38:38] Gigolo Joe: Will check if the 6f has the same or not Friend have dual 12f setup on his dualtron so we opened one to inspect the hardware a bit
[2022-04-19T22:39:53] Gigolo Joe: It does have magnachip mosfets from what i recall
[2022-04-19T22:40:54] sombre_enfant: They good tho
[2022-04-19T22:41:08] Unknown: They have clutch, pas, levcan canbus communication... Definitely built for e-bikes and EV use exclusively. They have all the features, settings, logging one could ever need on an electric vehicle without lots of uselessness..also complimentary uLight module
[2022-04-19T22:41:26] Unknown: How do you know?
[2022-04-19T22:42:05] Gigolo Joe: No it's something else, the one u mentioned is good upto 190A Nuc 12 can give 250
[2022-04-19T22:42:46] Gigolo Joe: Will check and update
[2022-04-19T22:44:11] Gigolo Joe: That's a great mosfet overall Only downside is it heats up really fast
[2022-04-19T22:44:42] Gigolo Joe: At least on the 75100 with 170 motor amps
[2022-04-19T22:45:52] sombre_enfant: Vsett got them too
[2022-04-19T22:46:36] sombre_enfant: https://lcsc.com/mobile/product-detail/MOSFETs_HUASHUO-HSP0076A_C2903573.html These seems good
[2022-04-19T22:46:49] Unknown: Absolutely not what Nuc uses... Their MOSFETs are more like 1.8mohm
[2022-04-19T22:47:01] Unknown: It is not made in Chinese factory
[2022-04-19T22:47:13] Unknown: Made by hand in Russia in small batches
[2022-04-19T22:48:33] sombre_enfant: 1.8mohm in to-220 🤨🤨🤨🤨
[2022-04-19T22:48:56] Unknown: There was Nuc MOSFET discussed and pinpointed a while ago... I can't find the info
[2022-04-19T22:49:10] Unknown: The mohms we're extremely low
[2022-04-19T22:49:32] Unknown: And we were talking about them... Maybe on Vsett chat... Hmm
[2022-04-19T22:49:59] sombre_enfant: Yeah get the ref would be good the minimum i seen was the one from my link, too bad theres no mosfet finder like cells

[2022-04-19T23:51:56] Paolo ⁭: Why? Are good fets
[2022-04-19T23:52:22] Unknown: Because we looked them up before and MOSFETs had super low impedance
[2022-04-19T23:53:34] Unknown: If I recall correctly, they were below 2mohm... Maybe 2.1... I feel like 1.7 or 1.8...

[2022-04-20T12:42:21] Mirono escooters: They promised me ups I got yunyu express or whatever
[2022-04-20T12:42:36] Artem Bulashev: 500w factory one was great
[2022-04-20T12:42:40] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3777@20-04-2022_12-42-40.jpg>

[2022-04-20T12:43:14] Artem Bulashev: Will see
[2022-04-20T12:43:18] Artem Bulashev: Test it carefully
[2022-04-20T12:43:19] Mirono escooters: They say factory stopped
[2022-04-20T12:43:27] Mirono escooters: Yea
[2022-04-20T12:43:32] Mirono escooters: I don't trust it too much now lol
[2022-04-20T12:43:44] Mirono escooters: Defenitely opening dispute. Unacceptable how they handles it
[2022-04-20T12:43:45] Artem Bulashev: Lockdown
[2022-04-20T12:43:50] Artem Bulashev: Covid in Beig

[2022-04-20T13:18:52] Lechu: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003736871422.html
[2022-04-20T13:33:42] Artem Bulashev: This is power supply not charger
[2022-04-20T13:34:46] Artem Bulashev: Difference is that it won’t switch to Constant Voltage at around 80% charge, it will continue pushing full set amps up until final voltage - I’m not even sure if it will shut off once target voltage is archived
[2022-04-20T13:36:31] Artem Bulashev: If you live such over night it will over charge and if your BMS doesn’t protect than boom fire
[2022-04-20T13:41:35] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_3778@20-04-2022_13-41-35.jpg>

[2022-04-20T13:41:58] Mirono escooters: Top
[2022-04-20T13:45:59] Happy Giraffe: Scumbag companies
[2022-04-20T13:47:00] Paolo ⁭: @SibClimb what do you think about 130mm motor?😂
[2022-04-20T13:47:14] Paolo ⁭: <video_file>
[2022-04-20T13:47:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Think it's insane, can't wait to test x)
[2022-04-20T13:47:53] Paolo ⁭: Yeah but how 😂😂 escooter s (except WEPED) can’t fit it
[2022-04-20T13:48:04] Paolo ⁭: And which tire ?
[2022-04-20T13:48:09] Face de Pin Sucé: It's only for Weped x)
[2022-04-20T13:48:18] Face de Pin Sucé: No sense on other scooters
[2022-04-20T13:48:31] Paolo ⁭: Why
[2022-04-20T13:48:52] Paolo ⁭: Fit shinko?
[2022-04-20T13:48:55] Face de Pin Sucé: Can't put normal tyre on it
[2022-04-20T13:49:21] Paolo ⁭: They made this for WEPED ?
[2022-04-20T13:49:39] Face de Pin Sucé: No, they made for testings but it's Weped Size
[2022-04-20T13:50:29] Paolo ⁭: But anyway hm made this before lol
[2022-04-20T13:51:06] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes 😂
[2022-04-20T13:51:19] Paolo ⁭: Design like 💩
[2022-04-20T13:51:52] Face de Pin Sucé: I'm not a fan
[2022-04-20T13:52:08] Paolo ⁭: But quality is better
[2022-04-20T13:52:20] Paolo ⁭: material quality
[2022-04-20T13:52:37] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes material quality is better but big prices also
[2022-04-20T14:00:01] Happy Giraffe: You could use a heavy chain or belt to drive that
[2022-04-20T14:00:14] Happy Giraffe: Would be insane😂
[2022-04-20T14:02:11] Paolo ⁭: 65mm power already insane
[2022-04-20T14:02:23] Paolo ⁭: 65 * 2 wtf
[2022-04-20T14:02:36] Paolo ⁭: I can’t never test it because I don’t like giant tire
[2022-04-20T14:04:44] Face de Pin Sucé: Maybe I'll test it
[2022-04-20T14:15:31] Happy Giraffe: Use pulley
[2022-04-20T14:15:48] Happy Giraffe: Can then transfer the torque for speed
[2022-04-20T14:49:43] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_3780@20-04-2022_14-49-43.jpg>
[2022-04-20T14:49:54] Mirono escooters: This is Nice bms.. way smaller then i expected
[2022-04-20T14:50:01] Mirono escooters: 80a for this size. Nice
[2022-04-20T14:51:15] Mirono escooters: Even thermal pad for balance resistors lol
[2022-04-20T14:51:18] Paolo ⁭: 80A is peak
[2022-04-20T14:51:28] Paolo ⁭: But for escooter use is good enough
[2022-04-20T14:52:06] Mirono escooters: No 160 is peak
[2022-04-20T14:52:12] Mirono escooters: 150*
[2022-04-20T14:53:11] Mirono escooters: I like, it's for powerwall but i Will order more for scoot

[2022-04-20T14:53:36] Mirono escooters: And 7-16s 80a
[2022-04-20T14:59:37] Happy Giraffe: Next question is if it melts during heavy use
[2022-04-20T14:59:50] Mirono escooters: Problably not i trust ant
[2022-04-20T15:31:13] sombre_enfant: I dont understand how to choose ants for what u need it for
[2022-04-20T15:33:24] Mirono escooters: They have many bmses all Diff sizes and setups
[2022-04-20T15:33:30] Mirono escooters: 7-16s or 8-20s for example
[2022-04-20T15:33:32] Mirono escooters: And many A

[2022-04-20T15:36:42] Mirono escooters: Have asked cant find
[2022-04-20T15:36:44] Mirono escooters: They friendly
[2022-04-20T15:39:34] Happy Giraffe: Thats why its bit fishy
[2022-04-20T15:40:22] Artem Bulashev: Ant is good but huge, JKBms fit my set up better than ant and power spot on what I required. Ant has more versions so can try find better fit
[2022-04-20T15:40:42] Mirono escooters: Jkbms is ofcourse better but price compared
[2022-04-20T15:40:48] Mirono escooters: I am cheeep :)
[2022-04-20T15:41:00] Mirono escooters: It's double layer each 8 mosfets tho

[2022-04-20T15:41:48] Mirono escooters: 60€?? Wow
[2022-04-20T15:42:05] Mirono escooters: Then understandable. Now it's more expensive
[2022-04-20T15:42:05] Artem Bulashev: What is the size of this one they have a link?)
[2022-04-20T15:42:05] Gigolo Joe: 130mm stator? Holy damnnn
[2022-04-20T15:42:18] Happy Giraffe: I am always skeptical on manufacturer claims nowadays. I see on PC industry its all bs there and people just take numbers out of their ass

[2022-04-20T15:44:10] Mirono escooters: Oof
[2022-04-20T15:46:41] Happy Giraffe: Sadly all RnD money goes to those 25kmh cocktractors

[2022-04-20T15:51:49] Happy Giraffe: Imagine using 3T version of motor and taking advantage of less resistance in copper. Torque is gained back from mechanical advantage from gearing.
[2022-04-20T15:52:11] Happy Giraffe: Same torque, less resistance and heat😳
[2022-04-20T15:52:43] Mirono escooters: Hmm
[2022-04-20T15:52:47] Mirono escooters: U lose with hearing
[2022-04-20T15:52:48] Mirono escooters: Gearing
[2022-04-20T15:52:51] Mirono escooters: And sound oempf
[2022-04-20T15:53:09] Happy Giraffe: I mean motor has chainring and wheel also
[2022-04-20T15:53:27] Happy Giraffe: You can get super torque this way from 3T
[2022-04-20T15:54:15] Mirono escooters: U Will snap chain
[2022-04-20T15:54:27] Mirono escooters: Theere's a reason we don't go over 500w middrive

[2022-04-20T15:56:27] Paolo ⁭: Ahah

[2022-04-20T16:13:33] Happy Giraffe: You would use motorcycle chain, or belt
[2022-04-20T16:14:15] Happy Giraffe: Those basic chains on even 250w cocktractors need changing after ~3000km
[2022-04-20T16:37:03] Paolo ⁭: Here are ubox mosfet 🥹

[2022-04-20T16:45:32] Mirono escooters: Slowly charged now need to do discharge test
[2022-04-20T16:45:58] Paolo ⁭: If bms not cut when under voltage then what they install for ahahah
[2022-04-20T16:46:15] Mirono escooters: For anti steal

[2022-04-20T23:59:01] Paolo ⁭: Battery pack died 🥲
[2022-04-20T23:59:11] Paolo ⁭: But 10k km without problem

[2022-04-21T00:02:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ??? does it have tubular frame ?
[2022-04-21T00:02:47] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_3789@21-04-2022_00-02-47.jpg>

[2022-04-21T00:04:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope. 2x750w.
[2022-04-21T00:04:22] Happy Giraffe: Not even in the legal print 250w?
[2022-04-21T00:05:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope. wasn't made for any legal purpose. when it was build no legislation were in place.
[2022-04-21T00:06:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it was out on the market in 2019
[2022-04-21T00:06:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: until the company died.
[2022-04-21T00:07:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: very poor choice on the battery
[2022-04-21T00:07:04] Happy Giraffe: I remember MKBHD did a video on that lol
[2022-04-21T00:07:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 12 kms in mode 3 🤣🤣🤣
[2022-04-21T00:07:43] Happy Giraffe: Shiet, less than xiaomi pro on S
[2022-04-21T00:07:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes... incredible.
[2022-04-21T00:08:48] Happy Giraffe: Are there any european designed e-scooters now?
[2022-04-21T00:09:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but everything else is excellent. controller build for example, we've never seen something like it' really. @Foujiwara took some pictures of the controller inside. just crazy. US design, build by foxcon.
[2022-04-21T00:10:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but they managed to kill the device with the battey choice. poor thing.
[2022-04-21T00:10:21] Happy Giraffe: Costs a lot (esc) by the sound of it
[2022-04-21T00:10:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, it did.
[2022-04-21T00:10:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: something like 1500e.
[2022-04-21T00:10:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: bought it for 430€ 😁
[2022-04-21T00:11:09] Happy Giraffe: Are we left with only chinese design now?😅
[2022-04-21T00:11:14] Happy Giraffe: Thats a steal
[2022-04-21T00:11:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahahah
[2022-04-21T00:11:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but spent a bit for the upgrade 😅
[2022-04-21T00:12:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: vesc, battery, tires, brake...
[2022-04-21T00:12:03] Happy Giraffe: Welcome to xiaomi gang

[2022-04-21T05:04:25] Unknown: Vsett 10+... Still pushing to max. 11.6 kw

[2022-04-21T05:04:49] Unknown: Battery is happy 😁. No stress
[2022-04-21T05:05:48] Unknown: Controllers just above ambient and motors at 135F 😎
[2022-04-21T05:06:04] Unknown: 79v resting. Not even full charge
[2022-04-21T05:09:38] Unknown: Nucular shows 11.6kw and BMS shows over 14kw. I think Nuc is correct but average the 2 at 13kw
[2022-04-21T05:10:50] Unknown: Will run again at full 84v full charge again and see where we end up
[2022-04-21T05:56:09] Unknown: N Log for now : )
[2022-04-21T05:56:46] Unknown: 0-60kmh 4.5 seconds and 0-80kmh in 7.5 seconds
[2022-04-21T06:24:00] Unknown: @roscheeee and whoever Raphael is... @Foujiwara Sustainable power output and still more power available. No stress on battery, controllers or motors, absolutely zero heat issues. This is how it's done friends. uBox can achieve these numbers but only for seconds on end. Build right, build once and succeed 😎 Oh wait... I'm running WW2 hardware.. mustn't be possible with such shit FOC Sinewave sensor less controllers 😆😆
[2022-04-21T06:38:01] rosheee: Not available u til tomorrow

[2022-04-21T09:34:56] Mirono escooters: To adjust small v. 4.2 is usually doable :)
[2022-04-21T10:32:52] Gigolo Joe: Yo have anyone tried this controller? If so any feedback, good/bad/crap?
[2022-04-21T10:32:52] Gigolo Joe: <photos/photo_3793@21-04-2022_10-32-52.jpg>
[2022-04-21T10:35:26] sombre_enfant: Mr wu did
[2022-04-21T10:35:42] Paolo ⁭: Hello, I bought two and both are failed. One get fireworks during auto detection, other one when I touched throttle on road . Now I understand why they are selling on banggood with half price
[2022-04-21T10:36:13] Gigolo Joe: Damn 🤣🤣 So crap it is
[2022-04-21T10:36:47] Paolo ⁭: Yes, useless thing

[2022-04-21T10:37:16] Gigolo Joe: Reaching 90 km/h
[2022-04-21T10:37:18] Paolo ⁭: The chinese that copied original design have did some error
[2022-04-21T10:38:01] Gigolo Joe: On the 75100 or 75200?
[2022-04-21T10:39:47] Paolo ⁭: 75200
[2022-04-21T10:40:00] Paolo ⁭: Both are copied , they never designed own
[2022-04-21T10:43:08] Gigolo Joe: Lol, not surprised
[2022-04-21T10:46:27] Gigolo Joe: So, any recommendations for a controller that outputs 200+ PA and supports 150+ BA ?
[2022-04-21T10:47:59] Paolo ⁭: actually no anything is good, maybe ubox dual 75v version.
[2022-04-21T10:49:34] Gigolo Joe: *Sad noises*

[2022-04-21T13:50:23] Mirono escooters: Nice
[2022-04-21T14:52:14] Paolo ⁭: That is the best mosfet exist for 80v , but problem isn’t mosfet, you should see other parts. When is so little means they’ve removed some components
[2022-04-21T15:59:14] Artem Bulashev: 1.1 rds niiice
[2022-04-21T15:59:27] Artem Bulashev: Which one is inside 75v ubox?

[2022-04-21T20:59:22] Happy Giraffe: Where?
[2022-04-21T20:59:44] rosheee: Question is which brake adapter..
[2022-04-21T20:59:46] Happy Giraffe: Weak link in xiaomi is the jst inside + thinner wire
[2022-04-21T20:59:58] Happy Giraffe: Port can handle a lot I think🤔
[2022-04-21T21:00:17] rosheee: The chinese denied me more amps

[2022-04-22T20:40:31] Mirono escooters: Mjeh
[2022-04-22T20:40:55] Mirono escooters: Monorim is worse then some flat metal with holes
[2022-04-22T20:52:03] Happy Giraffe: Buy cheapest bike disc, better than the ali shite
[2022-04-22T21:02:48] Martin Kaktits: WTF one has to do for the disc itself to become problem.
[2022-04-22T21:04:42] Happy Giraffe: Melt enough cocacola cans and then make a cast out of it
[2022-04-22T21:17:26] Oliver Eliasson: I got flipsky 75100 today and want to use it with spintend adc adapter, how do i Connect it?
[2022-04-22T21:17:26] Oliver Eliasson: <photos/photo_3807@22-04-2022_21-17-26.jpg>
[2022-04-22T21:18:23] Mirono escooters: I melt my own aluminum so i can try. Lol
[2022-04-22T21:20:37] Happy Giraffe: Flipsky seems to have Comm and Uart2 separately hmm
[2022-04-22T21:21:46] Happy Giraffe: I can't say for 100% so I leave it for @artBula and @koxx3
[2022-04-22T21:22:28] Gigolo Joe: Why would you need an adc adapter? What throttle are u using?
[2022-04-22T21:27:35] Lechu: nice, two uarts
[2022-04-22T21:28:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: never used this adapter. seems so crazy for me when you need only 2 resistors 😅
[2022-04-22T21:31:51] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_838@25-08-2021_19-02-38.jpg>
[2022-04-22T21:36:06] Oliver Eliasson: I have the adapter at home and seamed like it would make it easier, maybe not. I think i will have xiaomi or ninebot thumb throttle for now (waiting for @artBula curve throttle)
[2022-04-22T21:38:45] Oliver Eliasson: Probably like xiaomi thumb throttle
[2022-04-22T21:39:23] sombre_enfant: Yeah so 5v do the pull down resistor
[2022-04-22T21:39:23] Oliver Eliasson: Do i connect it to comm port and disregard adc3 on adc board?
[2022-04-22T21:40:24] sombre_enfant: @koxx3 do you put the resistor on bread board ?
[2022-04-22T21:41:06] Oliver Eliasson: I dont have resistor or anything at home and would like to not have to purchase anything more
[2022-04-22T21:41:21] Gigolo Joe: Won't be easier getting a 10$ common thumb throttle from aliexpress or your local ebike store?
[2022-04-22T21:44:48] Oliver Eliasson: My friend has sent me some stuff for other scooter and included a throttle but i don’t know which one yet😅 I think maybe xiaomi or similar because he repairs many of those scooters. So will see next week, maybe easier to skip adc board but i dont know

[2022-04-22T23:55:43] sombre_enfant: Used to see fullface
[2022-04-22T23:56:15] rosheee: that was with 16S5P (50-52km) and zero10x LE motors
[2022-04-22T23:57:02] sombre_enfant: Max speed and setting ?
[2022-04-22T23:57:04] rosheee: <photos/photo_3818@22-04-2022_23-57-04.jpg>
[2022-04-22T23:57:19] rosheee: idk but battery run hot outside temp. was like 25-30degrees
[2022-04-23T00:06:53] Mirko Boni: yess
[2022-04-23T00:07:13] Paolo ⁭: Absolutely crazy
[2022-04-23T00:08:28] Mirko Boni: Paolo, l'anello ha un adattatore in alluminio di un centimetro per dissipare il calore! ci sono molte persone che lo usano!
[2022-04-23T00:08:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i'd be curious to see after how many kms of downhill it would melt 😁
[2022-04-23T00:09:30] Mirko Boni: I never go downhill! I live in a city with few slopes!
[2022-04-23T00:09:32] Paolo ⁭: The producer says this should be used only for emergency brake 😬
[2022-04-23T00:11:35] Mirko Boni: In fact, I will also mount the disc brake on the back! So the one in front I use it at low speeds!
[2022-04-23T00:12:30] Paolo ⁭: I don’t see too much sense, just change the wheel and not need adapter .
[2022-04-23T00:12:51] Paolo ⁭: Fdm (specially pla) can’t be used in these application
[2022-04-23T00:13:00] Artem Bulashev: 25-30с wheel feel normal or even colder (skin temp is usually 25-30c). Hot usually means 55+c, very hot is above 65c even a bit painful to hold. 75c painful to hold extended time, 85c not possible to hold beside shortly
[2022-04-23T00:13:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1
[2022-04-23T00:13:26] Artem Bulashev: Break disk goes up above 150c
[2022-04-23T00:13:51] rosheee: i couldn't touch it

[2022-04-23T00:23:43] Mirko Boni: I'm talking about the temperature of the discs with the PLA adapter! I feel positive!

[2022-04-23T00:24:57] Mirko Boni: I understand that it can be scary, but I know other people who use it and have never burned!

[2022-04-23T00:35:26] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_3823@23-04-2022_00-35-26.jpg>
[2022-04-23T00:41:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and when i see magure on a g30, i don't understand. the pair of magura ruin any interest. better sell it and take better is you want more. magura pairs (if you put magura on the back too) cost half the escooter. and it's 'too much' (in perf & cost) for such scooter.
[2022-04-23T00:41:23] Mirko Boni: Can you see the aluminum ring? 1 cm thick!
[2022-04-23T00:41:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 💸
[2022-04-23T00:42:59] Mirko Boni: But I have no money problems! I can buy the magura! 😊😊😊
[2022-04-23T00:43:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: then buy a good escooter !
[2022-04-23T00:43:34] rosheee: lol when u don't have special price XD
[2022-04-23T00:43:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: stop ruining the poor g30 !
[2022-04-23T00:44:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's like putting ceramic brakes on a Lada 🤣🤣
[2022-04-23T00:45:10] rosheee: ^^' ok
[2022-04-23T00:45:13] Paolo ⁭: Nahhh
[2022-04-23T00:45:22] rosheee: i put porsche brakes on vw golf 3 vr6
[2022-04-23T00:45:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣
[2022-04-23T00:45:47] rosheee: what u run?
[2022-04-23T00:45:53] Paolo ⁭: I’m seem to made a g30 with 2 x 80a square wave controller
[2022-04-23T00:46:11] Paolo ⁭: 18s
[2022-04-23T00:46:13] rosheee: can u take ur scooter into train? and is it handy? can u transport it with 1 hand?
[2022-04-23T00:46:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for what ? brakes ?
[2022-04-23T00:46:17] rosheee: and have 11kw?
[2022-04-23T00:46:18] Paolo ⁭: And high Kv motor
[2022-04-23T00:46:21] rosheee: scooter and brakes 😆
[2022-04-23T00:46:25] rosheee: and what weight?
[2022-04-23T00:46:41] Mirko Boni: In truth I also have a Vsett 10+! I love to modify scooters!
[2022-04-23T00:46:50] rosheee: why u hate against g30 xD?
[2022-04-23T00:46:58] rosheee: it is more stable at 100kmh than vsett10+
[2022-04-23T00:46:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: boosted rev / spint 75v / singlet nutt / 80kg.
[2022-04-23T00:47:08] rosheee: what frame?
[2022-04-23T00:47:10] rosheee: yeh me is fatter
[2022-04-23T00:47:17] rosheee: and i get 50% on magura prices
[2022-04-23T00:47:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: boosted rev IS the frame
[2022-04-23T00:47:35] rosheee: what is rev?
[2022-04-23T00:48:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: https://www.google.com/search?q=boosted+rev&oq=boosted+rev&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i512j0i7i10i30j0i512l2j0i30l4.7180j1j9&client=ms-android-samsung-gs-rev1&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8
[2022-04-23T00:48:12] Paolo ⁭: Then put this in vsett
[2022-04-23T00:48:39] rosheee: looks groovy
[2022-04-23T00:48:53] rosheee: u would put brembo in g30 if possible
[2022-04-23T00:48:58] rosheee: and ebc yellow stuff
[2022-04-23T00:49:06] rosheee: but i put steelflex brake hose into g30
[2022-04-23T00:51:19] rosheee: but g30 frame looks more thicc than REV
[2022-04-23T00:51:24] rosheee: even if it is b00sted
[2022-04-23T00:51:39] rosheee: and is cheaper ^^
[2022-04-23T00:51:50] rosheee: + more space
[2022-04-23T00:51:54] Mirko Boni: Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah aiuto

[2022-04-23T00:53:27] Paolo ⁭: ?
[2022-04-23T00:53:39] Mirko Boni: I find the G30 very stable! The Vsett 10+ at 70 km / h vibrates at the front!
[2022-04-23T00:53:45] rosheee: yep
[2022-04-23T00:53:55] rosheee: @mirkus74 g30 at 105kmh no wobble
[2022-04-23T00:54:15] Mirko Boni: I don't want to change components in the vsett
[2022-04-23T00:54:31] Mirko Boni: Woow! Dual motor?
[2022-04-23T00:54:31] rosheee: vsett10+ owner wanna build g30

[2022-04-23T00:56:41] Paolo ⁭: La chiusura è soggetta a rottura , meglio non fidarsi
[2022-04-23T00:56:43] Paolo ⁭: Gg
[2022-04-23T00:56:56] Paolo ⁭: Now I switch on own vesc

[2022-04-23T00:58:05] rosheee: yah cooling no prob
[2022-04-23T00:58:27] Mirko Boni: Mai sentito di un G30 rotto!
[2022-04-23T00:58:45] Paolo ⁭: Anche nel gruppo di g30
[2022-04-23T00:58:47] rosheee: put 2x 4000W 70mm motors in it + 22S8P
[2022-04-23T00:58:56] rosheee: come stai?
[2022-04-23T00:59:03] Mirko Boni: Domani chiedo! Senza fare il tuo nome!
[2022-04-23T01:03:25] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_3825@23-04-2022_01-03-25.jpg>
[2022-04-23T01:03:52] Mirko Boni: Magari ci saltava!
[2022-04-23T01:04:20] Paolo ⁭: Si piegherebbe altro per prima
[2022-04-23T01:05:41] rosheee: fail
[2022-04-23T01:11:45] Federico77: perhaps Ela Sharkset 😜 This rod break is not very common. The breakage of the lever or pin that registers the closure is more frequent.
[2022-04-23T01:12:16] Paolo ⁭: La chiusura che si apre e frequente
[2022-04-23T01:12:19] Paolo ⁭: Successo anche a me
[2022-04-23T01:12:23] Federico77: No sucé??
[2022-04-23T01:12:30] Federico77: Si rompe
[2022-04-23T01:12:37] Federico77: Aperta mai successo
[2022-04-23T01:13:14] Mirko Boni: Anche a me, mai successo
[2022-04-23T01:13:51] Paolo ⁭: Si in quel senso
[2022-04-23T01:13:56] Paolo ⁭: Si apre si rompe
[2022-04-23T01:14:38] Federico77: 👍
[2022-04-23T01:29:10] rosheee: here not @feddec77
[2022-04-23T01:29:27] rosheee: but no parle italino keep it english perfavor
[2022-04-23T01:29:36] Federico77: 👍
[2022-04-23T01:30:38] Paolo ⁭: 👍
[2022-04-23T01:31:11] Federico77: that breakage at the base of the rod is less frequent, the breakage of the lever that opens the mechanism to close the rod or of the pin that regulates the tension of the closure is more frequent
[2022-04-23T01:31:40] Paolo ⁭: 👍
[2022-04-23T01:33:56] Federico77: <photos/photo_3826@23-04-2022_01-33-56.jpg>
[2022-04-23T01:34:48] Mirko Boni: Now that you've told me this, I'll buy it new! I'm afraid b
[2022-04-23T01:35:08] rosheee: lol
[2022-04-23T01:35:12] Federico77: @roscheeee This happens when the closure is too hard and the adjustment pin pushes on the lever, in the long run this happens
[2022-04-23T01:35:16] rosheee: buy new what xD?
[2022-04-23T01:35:19] rosheee: i never had this
[2022-04-23T01:35:22] rosheee: since i ride scooters ^^'
[2022-04-23T01:35:42] rosheee: i bought now my 6th g30
[2022-04-23T01:35:54] Federico77: It didn't happen to me either, it happened a month ago to a dear friend
[2022-04-23T01:36:26] Mirko Boni: I buy a new closure
[2022-04-23T01:36:49] Federico77: Yes, there is a replacement and it is cheap
[2022-04-23T01:37:09] rosheee: new g30 has new one
[2022-04-23T01:37:13] rosheee: but i never had that issue
[2022-04-23T01:37:17] Federico77: This shows that g30 breaks are rare
[2022-04-23T01:37:17] rosheee: fail
[2022-04-23T01:37:27] rosheee: i sold all g30
[2022-04-23T01:37:30] rosheee: or is it my 7th
[2022-04-23T01:37:37] rosheee: 1st g30d 2nd version
[2022-04-23T01:38:10] Federico77: Yes I read you got the new g30d 2nd version
[2022-04-23T01:38:51] Federico77: Better rear fender, stiffer and different closure if I'm not mistaken
[2022-04-23T01:39:27] rosheee: i have to cut rear fender '^'
[2022-04-23T01:39:35] rosheee: the v1 rear fender is also stiff on G30 "D"
[2022-04-23T01:39:54] rosheee: but i have to cut it a bit cuz 10x3 tires
[2022-04-23T01:40:42] Mirko Boni: I bought the 10x2.50 pmt
[2022-04-23T01:40:59] rosheee: had them before
[2022-04-23T01:41:41] rosheee: change every month
[2022-04-23T01:41:45] Mirko Boni: With 10x2.50 the fender does not touch, is that correct?
[2022-04-23T01:41:48] rosheee: and less grip + less comfort
[2022-04-23T01:41:53] rosheee: that is correct
[2022-04-23T01:42:00] rosheee: but 10x3 doesn't touch front fender
[2022-04-23T01:42:16] rosheee: just take off a bit of the rear
[2022-04-23T01:42:27] rosheee: i also use internal brake hose for rear brake
[2022-04-23T01:42:35] rosheee: not inverted magura mod
[2022-04-23T01:42:40] rosheee: then it is stabel
[2022-04-23T01:42:45] rosheee: when u use external mod it wobbles '^^'
[2022-04-23T01:43:04] rosheee: otherwise u just have to take a bit of inside can show u tomorrow when i redo it

[2022-04-23T03:44:09] rosheee: so iwanna try
[2022-04-23T03:44:09] Happy Giraffe: If you want to go max, then just cut a hole in side of frame, make a big heatsink that directly is from mosfet -> outside air
[2022-04-23T03:44:18] rosheee: alrdy done
[2022-04-23T03:44:18] rosheee: ^^
[2022-04-23T03:44:23] Happy Giraffe: Then its max
[2022-04-23T03:44:26] rosheee: nope
[2022-04-23T03:44:30] Unknown: But you said WW2 hardware, so you must know! RIGHT???

[2022-04-23T03:45:18] rosheee: and BTW
[2022-04-23T03:45:23] Happy Giraffe: Vaporchamber and sintered/grooved heatpipe systems take space and are stupidly complex
[2022-04-23T03:45:27] rosheee: ww2 material is nice ;-D
[2022-04-23T03:45:40] Unknown: Not your tone the other day

[2022-04-23T03:49:00] rosheee: we say "fopping"
[2022-04-23T03:49:05] Unknown: I always said the hardware isn't capable of high output like we demand. Please, someone develop a high output VESC
[2022-04-23T03:49:09] rosheee: i just wanna see the 100% power of yours
[2022-04-23T03:49:10] Happy Giraffe: <video_file>

[2022-04-23T03:50:12] rosheee: i would use 150KW vesc if it fit inside g30 frame
[2022-04-23T03:50:12] Happy Giraffe: There seems to be none atm, for single motor 200A phase even...
[2022-04-23T03:50:14] Unknown: I've provided graphs and info. No GoPro at this time.

[2022-04-23T03:50:48] rosheee: AND only vesc
[2022-04-23T03:50:52] rosheee: that fits inside is spintend
[2022-04-23T03:50:53] Unknown: Exactly my point @Happy_Giraffe Nucular 12F is 150a battery and 250a phase capable continuous
[2022-04-23T03:50:59] rosheee: trampa tampon vesc i need 20 and wont fit
[2022-04-23T03:51:08] rosheee: 250A phase per controller?
[2022-04-23T03:51:28] Unknown: I'm not sure if there ever will be high output VESC or other that fits inside uBox size
[2022-04-23T03:51:29] rosheee: my big mac can do that as well
[2022-04-23T03:51:35] Unknown: Yes

[2022-04-23T03:51:43] rosheee: i can do 200A phase with spintend
[2022-04-23T03:51:49] rosheee: and 100A battery per vesc
[2022-04-23T03:51:57] rosheee: so 200a battery 400A max current pjhase
[2022-04-23T03:52:00] rosheee: on spintend ubox

[2022-04-23T03:52:22] Happy Giraffe: Exactly
[2022-04-23T03:52:33] Happy Giraffe: Then burns or power is reduced
[2022-04-23T03:52:53] rosheee: with 8kw constant it never goes more than 40 degrees
[2022-04-23T03:53:02] Unknown: This is why I say it is impossible for uBox to match DUAL NUCULAR 12f. It physically, electronically isn't possible to compare
[2022-04-23T03:53:14] Happy Giraffe: I will put Hubsinks and Statorade on the motor to push it to max🌚
[2022-04-23T03:53:25] Unknown: That is best combo
[2022-04-23T03:53:37] rosheee: shit big mac so tasty after big tasty

[2022-04-23T13:24:51] Artem Bulashev: 😅😅😅
[2022-04-23T13:25:14] Artem Bulashev: It has glass transition temp of 60c 😂😂
[2022-04-23T13:27:25] Mirono escooters: Yea i know
[2022-04-23T13:27:28] Mirono escooters: I was confused too
[2022-04-23T13:29:02] rosheee: Soon..we will see
[2022-04-23T13:29:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i do not hate the g30 at all. good escooter. but going too far in mods, inpersonnaly think it's useless and costs more than it brings.
[2022-04-23T13:29:21] Artem Bulashev: I mean you won’t lose the break, but it can’t go misaligned. Because under first break king the temperature will get up to 120° on the edge, after a few of those plus if you’re running your motor hot you’re guaranteed to melt it. In summer side part of the motor can be over 60° if you’re pushing your motor
[2022-04-23T13:29:22] Artem Bulashev: If it works that’s great, but this is like asking for disaster. At least print it in PETG
[2022-04-23T13:29:23] Artem Bulashev: It has double of the glass transition temp if not more
[2022-04-23T13:29:36] Mirono escooters: I love g30
[2022-04-23T13:29:47] Artem Bulashev: Amen to that

[2022-04-23T14:56:51] Mirono escooters: Why
[2022-04-23T14:58:29] Mirko Boni: Please?
[2022-04-23T15:12:42] Unknown: Guys, is there any major reason we don't use Lipo packs in parallel/series for our scooters? Was looking at some 12,000mah 6s packs and realized that a monsterrr battery could be made from a handful of them. 3 in series is 18s and 3 in parallel is 36ah with huge huge discharge and charge rates. Would be a matter of mounting/securing them in the deck properly and then using either connectors (probably a lot of connectors) or soldering them together to make the series and parallel connections. Has anyone ever done or tried this? Just curious
[2022-04-23T15:13:03] Unknown: I know they aren't as safe and stable as lithium ion, but still curious lol
[2022-04-23T15:14:31] Tudor: What protection you have on those packs?
[2022-04-23T15:14:35] Tudor: Bms?
[2022-04-23T15:14:43] Tudor: There isn't
[2022-04-23T15:14:52] Tudor: Must be balance charged separate
[2022-04-23T15:14:55] Unknown: Well, that's sort of the thing... I'm not sure what could be used
[2022-04-23T15:15:19] Unknown: Right right... I used to charge 6 6s packs in parallel at a time on my icharger Duo
[2022-04-23T15:15:36] Tudor: There are plenty of high discharge lithium cells
[2022-04-23T15:15:43] Unknown: But yea, hooking each balance lead to charge is a pain
[2022-04-23T15:15:56] Unknown: I know that...
[2022-04-23T15:15:58] Tudor: And every time you vharge an 18s you split them and charge as a 6 s pack?
[2022-04-23T15:16:16] Unknown: Hmm.. yea, I guess that would be a challenge
[2022-04-23T15:17:09] Unknown: So lack of safety (no BMS) and inconvenience of having to charge separately you think are 2 of the main downfalls?
[2022-04-23T15:17:40] Unknown: I'm just curious.. which is why I'm asking. I'm not proposing anything lol
[2022-04-23T15:19:19] Unknown: I saw someone selling 12X 12,000mah 6s packs on endless sphere and thought to myself... What the hell would someone on here be selling these types of lipos for. Apparently he had them installed in his ebike 🤷🏻‍♂️. I found that interesting
[2022-04-23T15:19:53] Mirono escooters: Lipo is also way more dangerous :)
[2022-04-23T15:20:13] Mirono escooters: No metal casing, easier to Pierce
[2022-04-23T15:20:20] Mirono escooters: Also no build in safety. cid and so
[2022-04-23T15:21:33] Unknown: Gotcha. Makes perfect sense. That answers my question 😁
[2022-04-23T15:21:50] Mirono escooters: 😁
[2022-04-23T15:22:07] Mirono escooters: I use Lipo for my drones because of thé A needed from smol batt
[2022-04-23T15:22:15] Mirono escooters: But Ive seen many go up in races. Horror 😅
[2022-04-23T15:35:42] Unknown: Yup for sure. I've had dozens of 1200mah 4s lipos for my drones at one point. I'm actually very familiar with lipos from my RC days but just wasn't sure how or why they could or couldn't apply to our scooters and ebikes
[2022-04-23T15:36:46] Unknown: haha I know whatcha mean. I've watched RC Heli's fall from the sky and explode on impact into a flameball LoL.
[2022-04-23T15:38:36] Mirono escooters: Poef There goes 2000€
[2022-04-23T15:40:56] Unknown: OMG for sure man! I've had 700-800 size Heli's that cost upwards of $4k. I've watched grown men cry when they crash. One of the reasons I got out of the hobby, so fragile and so expensive
[2022-04-23T15:41:52] Mirono escooters: Yes. Me too. Scooters are more robust
[2022-04-23T15:42:04] Mirono escooters: Drones Fun and so. But 1 Tiny mistake. 500€ gone.. 😅

[2022-04-23T16:27:25] Artem Bulashev: The one for vsett won’t fit because Touvt for vsett 8.5x3 is rim size 134mm. Xiomi is 6.1inch rim - same as 10 inch vsett 10+ rim I believe which is why many xiomi run 10incg

[2022-04-23T18:08:21] Mirono escooters: I have 2 12s4a i Will never use
[2022-04-23T18:08:26] Mirono escooters: 12s is lame. ;)
[2022-04-23T18:09:26] Happy Giraffe: How far does the pot go?
[2022-04-23T18:10:08] Mirono escooters: Not much further
[2022-04-23T19:46:43] Gigolo Joe: Cuz it's not easy/cheap to find a proper BMS for a lipo pack
[2022-04-23T19:52:06] Mirono escooters: Huh. Lipo and Li ion are kinda same settings
[2022-04-23T19:54:41] Happy Giraffe: Lipo is death wish
[2022-04-23T19:55:13] Happy Giraffe: Randomly degrading chemistry that can blow up for real
[2022-04-23T19:55:19] Mirono escooters: True
[2022-04-23T19:56:11] Happy Giraffe: Nowadays also no reason to use it if we have 5p 40T that can do 150A burst anyway
[2022-04-23T19:56:20] Mirono escooters: True
[2022-04-23T19:56:30] Mirono escooters: I am looking with puppy eyes at wallet for 40t
[2022-04-23T19:56:42] Happy Giraffe: Not that expensive
[2022-04-23T19:56:50] Mirono escooters: For me yes
[2022-04-23T19:56:50] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2022-04-23T19:57:09] Happy Giraffe: Rob some old lady, problem solved
[2022-04-23T19:57:16] Mirono escooters: Ez
[2022-04-23T19:58:20] Happy Giraffe: I'm really keen on 48x now, will be insane range with 8p on that
[2022-04-23T20:05:44] Mirono escooters: Yes i like those too
[2022-04-23T20:05:52] Mirono escooters: How many Amps we're they and price? Mayget them
[2022-04-23T20:32:18] Gigolo Joe: Not really, people who run lipo usually use them because of the super high discharge rate
[2022-04-23T21:03:36] Mirono escooters: Uhu but chzrge settings and whatnot are same
[2022-04-23T21:29:43] Happy Giraffe: 3.35€/ for 135x order
[2022-04-23T21:30:11] Happy Giraffe: Amps depends as Samsung tells reasonable currents but they should be fine upto 15A
[2022-04-23T21:30:26] Happy Giraffe: Adam Can tell more as hes the one using them
[2022-04-23T21:32:12] Mirono escooters: Hmm Nice price

[2022-04-23T21:33:40] Happy Giraffe: Today was riding 3h, surprised that I managed to almost run the batt empty
[2022-04-23T21:33:55] Mirono escooters: Nice
[2022-04-23T21:34:13] Happy Giraffe: 2.5kwh battery planned for bike
[2022-04-23T21:34:28] Happy Giraffe: Have you measured your consumption?
[2022-04-23T21:35:47] Mirono escooters: Me? Not yet
[2022-04-23T21:35:48] Mirono escooters: I can
[2022-04-23T21:35:54] Mirono escooters: My first vesc scoot is done. Happy😂😂
[2022-04-23T21:36:03] Mirono escooters: It Will prob be much
[2022-04-23T21:42:57] Happy Giraffe: Lol, Im reading Teslas average 125wh/km in long distance riding. Mine was inside city center so tesla there would eat maybe double but still impressive
[2022-04-23T21:43:28] Happy Giraffe: 21700 96s31p Model 3 standard
[2022-04-23T21:44:09] Mirono escooters: Soo maaaannyyy ceeeellsss
[2022-04-23T21:44:18] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_3872@23-04-2022_21-44-18.jpg>
[2022-04-23T21:45:00] Happy Giraffe: Long range has even more P
[2022-04-23T22:37:29] Luis Magalhaes: Hi mates
[2022-04-23T22:37:44] Luis Magalhaes: Have a question for the big brains here 😂
[2022-04-23T22:38:03] Luis Magalhaes: Had a problem of detection of halls using the kelly controller
[2022-04-23T22:38:24] Luis Magalhaes: And now i was mesuring and the values are strange
[2022-04-23T22:38:40] Luis Magalhaes: 5v to grd says 5v
[2022-04-23T22:38:57] Luis Magalhaes: Grd to A signal says 11
[2022-04-23T22:39:02] Luis Magalhaes: To B says 5v
[2022-04-23T22:39:10] Luis Magalhaes: And C says 11v too
[2022-04-23T22:39:18] Luis Magalhaes: How? 😅
[2022-04-23T23:03:10] Happy Giraffe: @PaoloWu knows maybe
[2022-04-23T23:05:14] Mirono escooters: 11???
[2022-04-23T23:05:27] Mirono escooters: Is this hooked up to controller or not
[2022-04-23T23:05:53] Luis Magalhaes: Yes it was
[2022-04-23T23:06:11] Luis Magalhaes: Was the signal output receiving 11v from controller?
[2022-04-23T23:06:37] Mirono escooters: Yes. Possibl
[2022-04-23T23:07:02] Mirono escooters: There are smarter minds then me. But it is possible it has to get "pulled" "low" to whatever output of halls is. :) So could b normal
[2022-04-23T23:07:06] Mirono escooters: And B is pulled down
[2022-04-23T23:07:16] Mirono escooters: Turn wheel 1 magnet rotation and then check again
[2022-04-23T23:10:48] Luis Magalhaes: Yes should be that
[2022-04-23T23:11:03] Luis Magalhaes: I disconected them and mesure grd to output
[2022-04-23T23:11:10] Luis Magalhaes: And a max value was 3v
[2022-04-23T23:11:14] Mirono escooters: Aha
[2022-04-23T23:11:18] Mirono escooters: So my mind works. Great
[2022-04-23T23:11:57] Mirono escooters: Most halls are 3v output
[2022-04-23T23:14:31] Luis Magalhaes: Well they give less then 1v now
[2022-04-23T23:14:37] Mirono escooters: Hm
[2022-04-23T23:18:40] Luis Magalhaes: Tryed the kelly program
[2022-04-23T23:18:53] Luis Magalhaes: Only the C turnos to 0 and 1
[2022-04-23T23:19:09] Luis Magalhaes: A and B always 1
[2022-04-23T23:19:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: do you like such case ?
[2022-04-23T23:19:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_3874@23-04-2022_23-19-35.jpg>
[2022-04-23T23:19:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_3875@23-04-2022_23-19-35.jpg>
[2022-04-23T23:20:08] Mirono escooters: Ys
[2022-04-23T23:20:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's has a grainy textures (sls/pa12)
[2022-04-23T23:20:18] Mirono escooters: That's ba
[2022-04-23T23:20:24] Mirono escooters: 🥰
[2022-04-23T23:21:21] Luis Magalhaes: And only C goes to 0v when turning ao the rest should be fucked up
[2022-04-23T23:21:39] Luis Magalhaes: Shitty halls 😅 did not run once
[2022-04-23T23:21:53] Luis Magalhaes: And the rear has one dead too
[2022-04-23T23:22:40] Luis Magalhaes: But was good when i tryed first time then e remove the kelly to uso mínimotors with sensorless and it just died 😂
[2022-04-23T23:22:55] Luis Magalhaes: Love it 😍
[2022-04-23T23:27:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: thanks for the feedback guys. trying multiple production methods. next is plain aluminium 😉
[2022-04-23T23:28:14] Mirono escooters: Hmm that's also good
[2022-04-23T23:30:00] Happy Giraffe: Does alu make much condensation during winter?
[2022-04-23T23:30:40] Happy Giraffe: Also if it transfers the cold to components so well, will it be a problem?
[2022-04-23T23:32:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: good question
[2022-04-23T23:33:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the electronic board doesn't touch the case, but i have no idea !
[2022-04-23T23:35:07] Mirono escooters: Good call
[2022-04-23T23:35:23] Mirono escooters: Is there any Point in alu if not for heat tho
[2022-04-23T23:35:30] Mirono escooters: Can we have brighter display with alu :))))
[2022-04-23T23:36:35] Happy Giraffe: OLED is already crazy bright, especially with infinite contrast it will be clear
[2022-04-23T23:39:01] Mirono escooters: Ok fair
[2022-04-23T23:39:26] Mirono escooters: Me Building 25a max battery Also me: "yea 0.2×10 pure nickel is good."
[2022-04-23T23:39:29] Mirono escooters: Always go Overkill
[2022-04-23T23:39:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's already a very contrasted screen (VA tech). oled, it's much more complicated. require higher voltage is i remember correctly. and never found one with spi control interface
[2022-04-23T23:40:14] Mirono escooters: Haha yea, no need to go so Overkill :)
[2022-04-23T23:40:47] Happy Giraffe: Oh VA panel, I avoid those in monitors like black death😂
[2022-04-23T23:41:02] Happy Giraffe: But no ghosting issues in scooter screen haha
[2022-04-23T23:41:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahahah. it's weird, they call it ips/va.
[2022-04-23T23:41:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: at least, it's not a dirty TN 🤣🤣
[2022-04-23T23:41:59] Happy Giraffe: TN😅
[2022-04-23T23:42:28] Happy Giraffe: Do you have a picture how the VA looks?
[2022-04-23T23:44:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <video_file>

[2022-04-23T23:44:36] Mirono escooters: 🤤
[2022-04-23T23:44:44] Mirono escooters: Bootup is even nice
[2022-04-23T23:45:00] Mirono escooters: Fck i love this. I need this on my beast beast big scooter im planning.
[2022-04-23T23:45:04] Mirono escooters: What was final price gonna be
[2022-04-23T23:46:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ~400e for first batchs... until we manage to get higher volumes.
[2022-04-23T23:47:00] Happy Giraffe: Thats so cool
[2022-04-23T23:47:14] Happy Giraffe: Looks damn good
[2022-04-23T23:47:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: now, we moved to central position
[2022-04-23T23:48:14] Happy Giraffe: Could have some cable harness/holder for final version, would be extra sexy
[2022-04-23T23:49:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_3879@23-04-2022_23-49-04.jpg>
[2022-04-23T23:49:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, i already sent cables descriptions to multiples factories
[2022-04-23T23:49:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it will be provided
[2022-04-23T23:49:48] sombre_enfant: Rage website when ?
[2022-04-23T23:49:57] Mirono escooters: Aaa
[2022-04-23T23:50:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for vesc, it's really cool : only a single cable of 4 wires for can bus if you want only display
[2022-04-23T23:50:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i am building it for smartdisplay 😉
[2022-04-23T23:52:20] Happy Giraffe: Lets hope the cost issue can be solved, kickstarter is a bit meh but maybe Endless Sphere guys + us could manage a bigger order
[2022-04-23T23:53:20] Mirono escooters: Yea because 150€ or so im ready to pay. 400€.. ehh. Have vesc or Batt xd
[2022-04-23T23:53:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: light board is almost ready too. just have to test the power part (simple mosfets)
[2022-04-23T23:53:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: front light (5/12v up to 30w), rear light (same), and led stripe (fully configurable for turn, brake, side lights...)
[2022-04-23T23:54:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 150e, i think it will never be possible. it would require huge volumes.
[2022-04-23T23:54:31] Mirono escooters: Fuck
[2022-04-23T23:55:38] Happy Giraffe: It has so many functions I lost track already😂
[2022-04-23T23:55:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahahaha
[2022-04-23T23:56:33] Happy Giraffe: But it's good, 1-for-all solutions are always more reliable than a puzzle of chinajunk
[2022-04-23T23:57:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it really what we hate (raph, julien & me). spaghetti mosters like we see on most 'high end' scooters.
[2022-04-23T23:58:35] Mirono escooters: Yes it's a hell
[2022-04-23T23:58:38] Mirono escooters: Xiaomi did good job
[2022-04-23T23:58:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: smartelec devices are designed to be extensible like cars modules/options with a data bus. no more cables going everywhere.
[2022-04-23T23:58:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: sure ! they did !
[2022-04-23T23:59:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but it's a design adapted for a single model. trying to make something adaptable to 'any' escooters is really hard.
[2022-04-24T00:01:15] Happy Giraffe: I am currently delivering burgers to buy the display later. It will be so handy for police mode + managing battery/temps
[2022-04-24T00:01:34] Mirono escooters: True. But it's a start
[2022-04-24T00:01:43] Mirono escooters: Working on Xiaomi > working on any other spaghetti scoot
[2022-04-24T00:02:09] Happy Giraffe: Is KTY83 thermal motor sensor compatible with vesc?
[2022-04-24T00:35:37] Mirko Boni: @roscheeee I installed the rear disc brake with the monorim plate!

[2022-04-24T00:36:44] Mirko Boni: Monorim!
[2022-04-24T00:36:50] Mirono escooters: No no. Thé one on top
[2022-04-24T00:37:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_3883@24-04-2022_00-37-26.jpg>
[2022-04-24T00:37:43] Mirko Boni: Sorry I do not understand!
[2022-04-24T00:37:53] Mirko Boni: One moment
[2022-04-24T00:38:35] Mirko Boni: https://www.ridewill.it/p/it/shimano-cc322220-adattatore-freno-a-disco-postmount-da-180mm-a-220mm/1416368/
[2022-04-24T00:41:32] Mirko Boni: But it is wrong! I ordered another one!
[2022-04-24T00:41:42] Mirono escooters: Yes thanks
[2022-04-24T00:41:43] Mirono escooters: Oh xd
[2022-04-24T00:41:58] Mirono escooters: Hmm yes. I should learn to read. Am blind and tired
[2022-04-24T00:42:14] Mirono escooters: 500 washers isn't always best idea
[2022-04-24T00:43:12] Mirko Boni: This will fix the brake problem! https://www.ridewill.it/p/it/galfer-bike-sb002-adattatore-pinza-postmount-20mm-nero/754422/
[2022-04-24T00:43:27] Mirko Boni: 😊
[2022-04-24T00:44:35] Mirko Boni: In fact, I ordered the new adapter! I sent you the link!
[2022-04-24T00:51:29] Paolo ⁭: Is already compatible with Kelly?
[2022-04-24T00:54:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes. but i'll have to do more tests with kelly kls/ksl.
[2022-04-24T01:08:20] Paolo ⁭: Take me as tester😂
[2022-04-24T04:53:04] rosheee: <photos/photo_3884@24-04-2022_04-53-04.jpg>
[2022-04-24T07:03:16] Happy Giraffe: Use custom firmware and set ABSolute current to max 250 or 300A. Then annoying warning goes away
[2022-04-24T07:03:45] rosheee: Just posting
[2022-04-24T07:03:57] rosheee: Nevr had issue
[2022-04-24T07:04:14] Happy Giraffe: I had issue with single even with 5.2
[2022-04-24T07:04:27] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-04-24T07:04:45] Happy Giraffe: So all error limits to max and then it stfu again😂
[2022-04-24T07:07:49] Unknown: With the amount of units they sell, you'd think they could manage to tweak a stable up-to-date firmware 🙄. This type of thing is the difference between a company who knows what they're doing and a company who is just making ends meet good enough to be useable...or not. Do not recommend to use our most up to date firmware... Well... Fix it 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-04-24T07:08:43] Unknown: This is the type of thing that turns me off with the current VESC's out there.
[2022-04-24T07:08:57] rosheee: Omg
[2022-04-24T07:09:03] rosheee: Bitch pls
[2022-04-24T07:09:12] rosheee: They are 3 ppl

[2022-04-24T07:09:25] rosheee: How old is nucular?
[2022-04-24T07:09:30] rosheee: 6 years?
[2022-04-24T07:09:36] Unknown: Will you stop with the Nucular shit
[2022-04-24T07:09:41] Unknown: They are 2 guys
[2022-04-24T07:09:47] rosheee: Yay
[2022-04-24T07:09:49] Unknown: And they have stable firmwares
[2022-04-24T07:10:19] Unknown: Proprietary firmwares.. not someone else's they implement to their controllers
[2022-04-24T07:10:33] Unknown: It's not always about VESC versus Nucular bro
[2022-04-24T07:10:36] rosheee: Last upsate
[2022-04-24T07:10:37] Unknown: I'm just saying

[2022-04-24T07:10:59] Unknown: And they fixed it. You're out of control
[2022-04-24T07:11:04] rosheee: U are
[2022-04-24T07:11:09] rosheee: How old is the company?
[2022-04-24T07:11:25] rosheee: If spintend vesc had size of nucular

[2022-04-24T07:11:35] Unknown: So combative

[2022-04-24T07:30:54] rosheee: But alwaya hate..not even had vesc..makes me sad All is crap exxept his
[2022-04-24T07:46:12] Happy Giraffe: I think criticizing the clonky issues is a fair point as I experienced it myself. Nothing personal in that
[2022-04-24T10:23:01] Mirono escooters: Yea agree
[2022-04-24T10:23:22] Mirono escooters: Critizing isnt bad. If we gonna ban it we can better go live in north korea
[2022-04-24T11:06:41] Artem Bulashev: @roscheeee da hell man
[2022-04-24T11:06:45] Artem Bulashev: What’s your problem
[2022-04-24T11:06:55] Artem Bulashev: I think it’s time to chill out
[2022-04-24T11:07:10] Artem Bulashev: That is annoying as fuck your behavior
[2022-04-24T11:09:35] Artem Bulashev: Guys I muted @roscheeee for 1 week for his behavior
[2022-04-24T11:09:50] Artem Bulashev: This is long over due
[2022-04-24T11:10:24] Artem Bulashev: I had time I was considering leaving even because of his ass hole behavior towards other members
[2022-04-24T11:13:22] Artem Bulashev: Criticism is good and he was getting angry at Adam for criticism, objective and calmly expressed. Also criticism doesn’t need to be spelled out in the way that makes you look like an ass hole…
[2022-04-24T11:14:07] Artem Bulashev: Opposing opinions are needed and great, and we just lost a member with different perspective because of him
[2022-04-24T11:14:27] Mirono escooters: Oh who left?
[2022-04-24T11:14:34] Artem Bulashev: Adam
[2022-04-24T11:14:44] Mirono escooters: I want Adam back
[2022-04-24T11:16:33] Artem Bulashev: 🤷‍♂️ well that’s not up to me at this point, but will text him
[2022-04-24T11:19:55] Mirono escooters: Yes pls :)

[2022-04-24T11:34:07] Mirono escooters: Remember i said i wasn't gonna let 4.2 flipsky sweat? Well... I got a second battery... 120 phase/50 batt
[2022-04-24T11:34:09] Mirono escooters: Fuck it

[2022-04-24T11:45:49] Mirono escooters: Right one untightened itself
[2022-04-24T11:45:58] Mirono escooters: And then.. left didnt wanna do it anymore.
[2022-04-24T11:46:02] Mirono escooters: My fault. It wasn't tightened hard.
[2022-04-24T11:47:15] Mirono escooters: Hope halls fine I Cant live without halls

[2022-04-24T12:13:04] Face de Pin Sucé: +1000
[2022-04-24T12:32:18] Mirono escooters: Does flipsky 4.2 have a fuse on 5v?
[2022-04-24T12:32:26] Mirono escooters: It doesnt do anything. Not even per USB.
[2022-04-24T13:13:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: never seen fuse on flipsky
[2022-04-24T13:14:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: probabaly dead then
[2022-04-24T13:16:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what did you do ?

[2022-04-24T14:05:36] Mirono escooters: Yes there goes my vesc.back to Xiaomi
[2022-04-24T14:15:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahhh..didn't the wrapped cord wire 😓
[2022-04-24T14:20:50] Mirono escooters: It got so tight it. Touched Brake and it grinded through.
[2022-04-24T14:20:53] Mirono escooters: Lucky me..
[2022-04-24T14:21:09] Mirono escooters: I can do basic smd. I Will find where 5v chip thing is and see what is damaged and maybe fix. But don't have high hope
[2022-04-24T14:21:16] Mirono escooters: Xiaomi controller works too. :)
[2022-04-24T15:03:29] Paolo ⁭: <animation>

[2022-04-24T15:13:53] Unknown: If you look back at my posts on here, I would say less than half of them are regarding Nucular. As Artem said, I think it's healthy to give other perspective. I'm never of mindset that one is better or anything like that. We talk about about a lot of helpful and useful things here other than VESC, which I have been a part of. I would like to think I bring something a little different to the table, a different perspective with different ideas and setup. It's never ever about bashing VESC, I think most people here know that. As a matter of fact, I've used VESC in many other applications than scooters and I think the firmware is absolutely brilliant. The issue we are dealing with right now is the available hardware that is limited for high output motors and batteries, which is why Paolo is building a custom high power VESC. I think that will be an amazing addition to the community. So again, just because I don't currently use VESC doesn't mean my contributions to the group are null and void. I remember the day perfectly when I shared the Nuc uLight module and everyone was like "what is that"... I explained it and Artem shared it with you, which maybe (not saying for sure) it gave you inspiration to create your light board. Ideas and other perspectives are healthy in our hobby. Roscheeee was rude and uncontrolled, literally attacking me which is why I had enough. Artem, thank you. And thank you all for everything you contribute. I learn more here than anywhere else honestly
[2022-04-24T15:15:09] Mirono escooters: Nice and mature :)
[2022-04-24T15:16:56] Unknown: Thanks bro 🤓
[2022-04-24T15:59:04] Happy Giraffe: Usually you gotta yeet the axle tight real hard, about 50Nm is what the slot can typically handle.
[2022-04-24T15:59:18] Mirono escooters: Yes. I forgor. :(
[2022-04-24T15:59:32] Mirono escooters: Xiaomi time. Bye bye vesc. :/
[2022-04-24T15:59:55] Mirono escooters: I Will use your Dash. Lol
[2022-04-24T15:59:55] Happy Giraffe: If 5v shorted can it be fixed?
[2022-04-24T16:00:00] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>

[2022-04-24T16:00:23] Happy Giraffe: As you use lov kv motor, make some torque arms
[2022-04-24T16:00:29] Mirono escooters: Yea
[2022-04-24T16:00:33] Mirono escooters: Also

[2022-04-24T16:10:10] Mirono escooters: Nice
[2022-04-24T16:10:13] Unknown: Very stable Vsett 10 🤓. Not sure how some say Vsett isn't stable at high speeds 🤷🏻‍♂️. The beginning is just a straight away but the middle/end is a fun winding road.
[2022-04-24T16:11:04] Mirono escooters: Maybe maintenance matters alot
[2022-04-24T16:12:34] Unknown: It must be something, I know I wouldn't ride like this without a steering damper. Shocks and PMT tires help a lot. At 80khm I'm planted
[2022-04-24T16:19:46] Paolo ⁭: Yes bro but you have steering damper
[2022-04-24T16:20:29] Paolo ⁭: Try remove it and brake at 70kmh with front wheel
[2022-04-24T16:25:55] Unknown: I really wouldn't feel comfortable riding without it lol. I've been with it for the last 6 months and really super used to it. Before I had it I didn't necessarily feel unstable, but felt that any big bump or hole in the hole could throw me off balance quick at higher speed
[2022-04-24T16:29:02] Luis Magalhaes: 👌
[2022-04-24T16:29:21] Luis Magalhaes: Adam what to see it screaming 😜😂

[2022-04-24T16:33:31] Unknown: So fun on those back winding roads carving back n forth (and dodging potholes!) I love riding so much 😍
[2022-04-24T16:36:00] Paolo ⁭: Vsett and all type scooter with C fork are not stable , this is a normal due to the fork movements
[2022-04-24T16:40:17] Unknown: For sure. It's inherent by design but fortunately us Vsett owners have figured out that damper, tires and shocks minimize that effect quite a bit with good components and setup
[2022-04-24T21:56:57] Artem Bulashev: Yeah need that hub off set to be forword
[2022-04-24T21:59:15] Artem Bulashev: But Scooter manufacturers didn’t figure it out yet
[2022-04-24T22:06:50] sombre_enfant: Vsett💀💀

[2022-04-24T22:20:03] Mirono escooters: Xd 25a battery. But Overkill isn't bad
[2022-04-24T22:20:18] Mirono escooters: I don't know who said to do this. I think @artBula ?
[2022-04-24T22:20:21] Mirono escooters: Good suggestion
[2022-04-24T22:20:26] Artem Bulashev: Great frame, but too small battery space, too small deck, need both new motors, new both new suspention, need both new disk breaks and both new hydraulic brake systems. Also needs new battery and new controller, and better tires for new disks 😂😂😂 that’s why I think it is terrible platform, great scooter though
[2022-04-24T22:20:49] Mirono escooters: Ssshtttt. Don't use logic to me
[2022-04-24T22:21:01] Happy Giraffe: If you have big penis, Xiaomi is ok

[2022-04-24T22:21:27] Mirono escooters: More batt space you want?
[2022-04-24T22:21:33] Artem Bulashev: Looks good, yeah that will help with even amps pull from each P
[2022-04-24T22:21:36] Mirono escooters: I overcompensate
[2022-04-24T22:21:44] Mirono escooters: Thanks bud. Trying to learn
[2022-04-24T22:21:57] Happy Giraffe: Thats a gigantic spacer
[2022-04-24T22:22:11] Artem Bulashev: That is no longer m365
[2022-04-24T22:22:17] Mirono escooters: I didnt make it ;)
[2022-04-24T22:22:33] Mirono escooters: Still Xiaomi But yes i agtee
[2022-04-24T22:22:41] sombre_enfant: 4x40=270? Math aint mathing💀
[2022-04-24T22:22:54] Mirono escooters: ._
[2022-04-24T22:23:02] Happy Giraffe: 270 cells no way
[2022-04-24T22:23:02] Mirono escooters: Without cases u fit way mord
[2022-04-24T22:23:03] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2022-04-24T22:23:07] Mirono escooters: Without holders
[2022-04-24T22:23:12] Mirono escooters: Idk not my claims
[2022-04-24T22:23:21] Artem Bulashev: Also would cost insane amount of money for less tech savvy people :)
[2022-04-24T22:23:22] Mirono escooters: Still impresie sace
[2022-04-24T22:23:39] Happy Giraffe: G30 would fit maybe 270 with such fat spacer
[2022-04-24T22:23:47] Mirono escooters: But would u trust 3d printed tray and like 18 M3 screws with are badly tappd to hold 30kg?+-?
[2022-04-24T22:23:52] Mirono escooters: And accident. Ooooff... Cells at side
[2022-04-24T22:23:58] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2022-04-24T22:24:09] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2022-04-24T22:24:29] sombre_enfant: G30 160x 18650 no spacer if controller outside
[2022-04-24T22:25:01] Artem Bulashev: Entire vsett 10+ deck fits 20s9p - and that is more than any scooter in that class category (21700)
[2022-04-24T22:25:02] Happy Giraffe: But now 18650 is obsolete🌚
[2022-04-24T22:25:14] Mirono escooters: 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
[2022-04-24T22:25:21] Artem Bulashev: 21700

[2022-04-24T22:26:18] Mirono escooters: You Da Voss
[2022-04-24T22:26:19] Mirono escooters: Boss
[2022-04-24T22:26:22] Artem Bulashev: Damm
[2022-04-24T22:26:23] Artem Bulashev: Expected more
[2022-04-24T22:26:34] Happy Giraffe: Do you know a website where you can design batt layouts?
[2022-04-24T22:26:46] Happy Giraffe: Im too lazy to draw myself
[2022-04-24T22:26:59] Artem Bulashev: No sorry, there are some but very basic once
[2022-04-24T22:27:03] Mirono escooters: I just use mind and tinkercad to print my holders lol
[2022-04-24T22:27:14] sombre_enfant: Repackr
[2022-04-24T22:27:19] Mirono escooters: 18650battery on Android but Cant even do basic size requests let alone special
[2022-04-24T22:27:54] sombre_enfant: Classic layout is best for current flow or hexagonal
[2022-04-24T22:28:01] Happy Giraffe: I mean not used cells but the overall dimensions etc shape
[2022-04-24T22:28:29] Artem Bulashev: If you use sheets yeah, but if you use # than yeah not so much 😄😄
[2022-04-24T22:28:29] Happy Giraffe: Im figuring how can I max a triangle shape in middle of bike frame with 21700
[2022-04-24T22:28:31] Mirono escooters: Id just draw it tbh
[2022-04-24T22:28:39] Mirono escooters: No way a generator Will do that
[2022-04-24T22:28:42] Mirono escooters: Just trial and error
[2022-04-24T22:29:32] Happy Giraffe: Something like this 18s8p but it will be bigger due to 18650 vs 21700
[2022-04-24T22:29:39] sombre_enfant: Other way around
[2022-04-24T22:32:06] Happy Giraffe: Current 13s6p 35E not big enough grrrr
[2022-04-24T22:33:28] Artem Bulashev: No no. Look. If you use sheets than you have more cross section (maximum) on in line cells. But if you are # with straight than you may have less crossection, than cells grouped in a few rows per P (shorter length of inter-series connection) with sheet of metal connecting groups But yeah in line cells with sheets of copper is 😍
[2022-04-24T22:35:32] Happy Giraffe: Any conclusion on whats the best way to build copper batt?
[2022-04-24T22:35:50] Happy Giraffe: Nickel tab on top? What about corrosion etc?
[2022-04-24T22:38:17] sombre_enfant: Tin
[2022-04-24T22:39:00] Happy Giraffe: Hmmm
[2022-04-24T22:46:08] Mirono escooters: Copper sandwich
[2022-04-24T22:46:14] Mirono escooters: Just pack it Well for corrosion
[2022-04-24T22:46:24] Artem Bulashev: Work with gloves and spray contacts on battery after finishing with something like “Kontakt 60” done, takes 2 sec, than seal it well and never a problem unless you go swimming with it

[2022-04-24T22:54:47] Unknown: This is an awesome battery design tool. Must be used on PC, I couldn't get it to work on my phone
[2022-04-24T22:56:13] Unknown: That's basically what I did with mine. Wiped each tab/weld joint down with alcohol rub to remove finger oils and contaminants from the metal itself and then seal entire battery from elements with multiple layers of kapton tape, fish paper and heatshrink
[2022-04-24T22:56:46] Happy Giraffe: I love you man, fullhomo
[2022-04-24T22:57:00] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-04-24T22:57:15] Unknown: You can adjust cell dimensions to the .1mm and use all different shape layouts and it will show you exactly how many cells will fit and you can chose your shape!

[2022-04-24T22:57:33] Unknown: LoL
[2022-04-24T23:00:42] Happy Giraffe: Damn, will be tough to fit it all...

[2022-04-24T23:27:16] Mirono escooters: Fiido modded
[2022-04-24T23:27:27] Happy Giraffe: Nah Fiido is shite frame
[2022-04-24T23:27:56] Happy Giraffe: I can maybe get this with custom steel battery box also with a lock
[2022-04-24T23:28:15] Happy Giraffe: Only problem is lack of suspension in front tho
[2022-04-24T23:32:04] Happy Giraffe: Maybe could get moto rim and proper michelin tires for once😂
[2022-04-24T23:44:06] Artem Bulashev: This web app can’t do any advance layout. It is only good to guesstimate. It is not precise enough unfortunately and is not able to calculate if flat layers would feel space better. Also doesn’t account for hight. So it is good for basic but sometimes you may gain by shifting cells away to reduce hight in expense of length , and it can’t do that either unfortunately (not sure why)
[2022-04-25T00:15:20] Unknown: Absolutely... It's helpful to get an idea but a cad design program would be needed if doing certain layouts or cutting things down to the mm
[2022-04-25T00:17:22] Unknown: You can't do stacked layout for example (cells laying horizontally in multiple levels where nickel/copper is folded)
[2022-04-25T00:22:54] Unknown: @artBula once you designed a d showed me my 20s9p layout,, I put it into that program and was able to replicate it but probably wouldn't have been able to come up with it own my using just that program, definitely couldn't get such exact measurements. There have been some e-bike guys on endless sphere that use that program to get an idea because it has the triangle layout for ebike frames... To get a general idea since it's really easy to use and get in the ballpark. From there you can take that info and put it into a cad program potentially saving a lot of time by having a general idea before you start
[2022-04-25T13:34:12] Oliver Eliasson: Can i use this to find out which pin i + and which is - on the charge port of the scooter and the charger?
[2022-04-25T13:44:41] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-04-25T13:44:50] Mirono escooters: Good multimeter :) used long before upgrading
[2022-04-25T13:44:55] Luis Magalhaes: Yes in the volts functions
[2022-04-25T13:45:13] Oliver Eliasson: Think i found it
[2022-04-25T13:45:30] Oliver Eliasson: Small minus when wrong and no when right polarety?
[2022-04-25T13:45:30] Luis Magalhaes: 👌
[2022-04-25T13:46:13] Luis Magalhaes: Yes if the black probe is on + and red is on - you have a negative value
[2022-04-25T13:46:24] Oliver Eliasson: Yes
[2022-04-25T13:46:58] Oliver Eliasson: Thanks
[2022-04-25T16:31:56] D J: Hi guys. what kind of fuse box/fuse do you use to protect the battery from short circuit?
[2022-04-25T16:34:11] Mirono escooters: A bms. :)
[2022-04-25T16:36:24] Unknown: So after burning my chinesium shit motor, i burned my original motor after bearly 250km
[2022-04-25T16:36:37] Unknown: Worth to check vesc or not? 😅
[2022-04-25T16:36:54] Mirono escooters: Why? Vesc prob ok
[2022-04-25T16:36:56] Unknown: Both had 1 phase burned out
[2022-04-25T16:37:03] Unknown: Seems weird
[2022-04-25T16:37:12] Mirono escooters: Meh just unlucky and ur pushint too much
[2022-04-25T16:37:13] Mirono escooters: Xe
[2022-04-25T16:37:14] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2022-04-25T16:37:18] Mirono escooters: Survived Longer then expected
[2022-04-25T16:37:24] Unknown: I updated vesc like 2-300 km before the first burned one xd
[2022-04-25T16:37:57] Unknown: Original read put at 27 amps, xiaomi 250w and i pushed like 50-70 limit
[2022-04-25T16:38:06] Unknown: Amps*
[2022-04-25T16:38:29] Mirono escooters: Yeea no wonder it burned
[2022-04-25T16:38:53] Unknown: Idk haha
[2022-04-25T16:40:41] D J: wouldn't it be better and cheaper to apply a fuse instead of burning the BMS?
[2022-04-25T16:41:00] Mirono escooters: A bms triggers overcurrent.. doesnt burn
[2022-04-25T16:41:06] Mirono escooters: Or that's thé principle atleast
[2022-04-25T16:41:14] Mirono escooters: A bms can Respond in microseconds. fuse not
[2022-04-25T17:01:48] D J: @Mirono_escooters thanks for the info and explanation 👌

[2022-04-25T17:46:07] sombre_enfant: Oh 30sec ok
[2022-04-25T18:14:38] Luis Magalhaes: Smart bms 😁
[2022-04-25T18:14:43] Mirono escooters: Indeed

[2022-04-25T18:21:06] Luis Magalhaes: Mine had a little test run today
[2022-04-25T18:21:25] Luis Magalhaes: Can only ride in mode 1, 40% battery
[2022-04-25T18:21:31] Luis Magalhaes: Did 80A total
[2022-04-25T18:21:33] Luis Magalhaes: Battery
[2022-04-25T18:23:15] sombre_enfant: Managed to put the hall ?
[2022-04-25T18:23:44] Unknown: Also BMS protects charge cycle and balances cells. A fuse cannot balance your cells. BMS for sure, ideally with discharge protection and charge protection. I personally prefer active balancer BMS such as JK but generally any smart BMS will do the job, keep you safe and keep your cells happy and balanced
[2022-04-25T18:28:14] D J: I really have to buy the Smart bms
[2022-04-25T18:28:30] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-04-25T18:28:56] D J: Thanks 👌
[2022-04-25T18:30:06] Luis Magalhaes: Yes, had to change 2 sensors in front and 1 in rear but running now 😂
[2022-04-25T18:30:27] Luis Magalhaes: He will use bms but could be a dumb one 😂
[2022-04-25T18:30:43] Luis Magalhaes: Larga a nota 😂
[2022-04-25T18:32:26] D J: Yap 😅
[2022-04-25T18:40:20] Luis Magalhaes: After burning my battery i now think its the best upgrade we can pay for 😜
[2022-04-25T18:42:54] D J: Burn the battery not good
[2022-04-25T18:53:05] Unknown: LoL. I would only use a dumb BMS if smart BMS wouldn't fit due to available space. Being able to see and monitor the cells with smart BMS is just too good of a feature to pass up. My JK BMS with active balancer is nice because you can toggle balance mode on/off at any state of charge, not just near full charge while charging. My battery hasn't needed to be balanced in the 320 miles I've used it for so far, so it's not "force balancing" at the top of the charge cycle. I also like to keep the balance function off during charge (and discharge) to get an accurate idea of how the cells are acting without the balancer making up for any inconsistencies.
[2022-04-25T18:56:50] Luis Magalhaes: True
[2022-04-25T18:57:21] Mirono escooters: I always use smartbms when possible. Extra money so worth it
[2022-04-25T18:57:52] Luis Magalhaes: Agree
[2022-04-25T18:58:18] Mirono escooters: Don't cheap on bmses
[2022-04-25T18:58:20] Mirono escooters: Or any part of bztt
[2022-04-25T19:17:15] D J: Link for a good bms?

[2022-04-25T19:22:49] D J: Thanks 👍
[2022-04-25T19:39:10] Unknown: JK BMS has been working great for me. Artem also uses a different model JK BMS on his custom Vsett 9 battery.
[2022-04-25T20:07:32] Mirono escooters: Jkbms i forgot. Didnt test personally but looked damn good

[2022-04-26T16:59:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 1/ this diagram for xiaomi brake is crazy and risk to burn the stm adc.
[2022-04-26T17:00:20] Mirono escooters: Why crazy? Xiaomi Brake output doesnt go over 3.3v
[2022-04-26T17:00:32] Mirono escooters: And u can input 3.3v on Xiaomi Brake. I tried
[2022-04-26T17:00:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 2/ you can try to simply put the 2 wires brake between adc2 and 3.3v (edited)
[2022-04-26T17:00:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it does powered with 5v
[2022-04-26T17:00:53] Mirono escooters: Oh
[2022-04-26T17:01:00] Mirono escooters: Gnd and 3.3v?
[2022-04-26T17:01:03] Mirono escooters: Then you Will short it
[2022-04-26T17:01:06] Mirono escooters: 3.3v to gnd
[2022-04-26T17:01:12] Mirono escooters: Thé simple brakes are just a switch
[2022-04-26T17:01:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: with a resistor of course !!
[2022-04-26T17:01:20] Mirono escooters: So between 3.3v and signal
[2022-04-26T17:01:40] Mirono escooters: But it Will be on/off. So don't go hard on ebrake 😳
[2022-04-26T17:01:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lol crap
[2022-04-26T17:01:53] Mirono escooters: Yea shit
[2022-04-26T17:01:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i said shit 🤣🤣🤣
[2022-04-26T17:02:05] Mirono escooters: Just use thumb brake or no ebrake xd
[2022-04-26T17:02:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 3.3v and adc2
[2022-04-26T17:02:12] Mirono escooters: Can happen 🤗
[2022-04-26T17:04:04] Happy Giraffe: The brake he has is on/off type
[2022-04-26T17:04:36] Happy Giraffe: =two wires
[2022-04-26T17:06:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the issue is, not connected (brake switch not activated), it is floating. and adc often doesn't read 0v. if it doesn't, you'll need a 'pull down' resistor
[2022-04-26T17:09:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <sticker>
[2022-04-26T17:18:17] Oliver Eliasson: 3.3 v and adc does not work
[2022-04-26T17:18:28] Oliver Eliasson: Or i do something wrong when in setup
[2022-04-26T17:18:52] Oliver Eliasson: So i need to get 3 pin handle?
[2022-04-26T17:23:06] Happy Giraffe: ADC adapter doesnt work in flipsky?
[2022-04-26T17:23:44] Oliver Eliasson: Maybe, i tried but did not work right away so tought this would be easier
[2022-04-26T17:24:52] Happy Giraffe: You need to have it as 5v mode and then choose Throttle type ADC1 with ADC2 brake button
[2022-04-26T17:25:15] Oliver Eliasson: Okey will try agian
[2022-04-26T17:25:45] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_3901@26-04-2022_17-25-45.jpg>

[2022-04-26T18:29:05] Oliver Eliasson: I dont know, it shows signal in setup and when i hit apoly it not work
[2022-04-26T18:30:00] Happy Giraffe: What do you want from brake? Motor power cutoff?
[2022-04-26T18:30:39] Oliver Eliasson: Motor power cutoff and fixed regen braking (can set lower value but nice with some)
[2022-04-26T18:31:04] Happy Giraffe: Does it stop motor now?
[2022-04-26T18:31:12] Oliver Eliasson: Nope
[2022-04-26T18:32:08] Happy Giraffe: Have you selected the "on/off" brake in ADC adapter?
[2022-04-26T18:32:19] Happy Giraffe: Proportional is wrong
[2022-04-26T18:32:31] Oliver Eliasson: Yes its on switch side
[2022-04-26T18:32:37] Happy Giraffe: Hmm
[2022-04-26T18:32:41] Happy Giraffe: Then Im not sure
[2022-04-26T18:32:49] Oliver Eliasson: I have another adc board i can try
[2022-04-26T18:32:55] Oliver Eliasson: Maybe something wrong
[2022-04-26T18:33:11] Happy Giraffe: Do that, and make sure it stays on 5v or whatever throttle you use
[2022-04-26T18:33:12] Oliver Eliasson: Will try som more tonight
[2022-04-26T18:33:17] Oliver Eliasson: Yes
[2022-04-26T18:33:23] Happy Giraffe: If you change that when vesc on, adc dies

I synchronized with the engines and now when I went to confirm the throttle input (I am using their adapter) it does not detect the throttle. am i doing something wrong?
[2022-04-26T18:36:06] Mirono escooters: Problably connected wrong
[2022-04-26T18:36:16] Mirono escooters: Or wrong switch
[2022-04-26T18:36:25] Happy Giraffe: Adapter settings?
[2022-04-26T18:36:38] Happy Giraffe: If you have 5v throttle then 5v etc
[2022-04-26T18:36:55] Happy Giraffe: Also connected to throttle1?
[2022-04-26T18:37:07] D J: Tried 5V and 3.3 and nothing
[2022-04-26T18:37:52] Happy Giraffe: Show us your adc setting on vesc app

[2022-04-26T19:25:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 👍👍
[2022-04-26T19:26:01] Happy Giraffe: Cheapest 10g or big mx2/4/5 tube is cheap enough
[2022-04-26T19:27:00] Mirono escooters: Allie works for Xiaomi esc lol

[2022-04-26T19:28:08] Happy Giraffe: 9€ for 20g lul
[2022-04-26T19:28:22] Mirono escooters: 1.5€ for 20g 🤗
[2022-04-26T19:28:24] Happy Giraffe: You really want good transfer there tho
[2022-04-26T19:28:33] Mirono escooters: For 25a Rita girlfriend?
[2022-04-26T19:28:35] Paolo ⁭: I got 20€ 65g
[2022-04-26T19:28:41] Paolo ⁭: 23*
[2022-04-26T19:28:43] Happy Giraffe: It's crap lol, 20g lasts for a year
[2022-04-26T19:28:56] Mirono escooters: I don't Care xd
[2022-04-26T19:28:59] Mirono escooters: It's for Fun
[2022-04-26T19:29:04] Mirono escooters: And when i Mess with radiators
[2022-04-26T19:31:16] Happy Giraffe: Lol
[2022-04-26T20:42:07] Mirono escooters: What do you guys think of max power bullet of xt60? Removed from case. Same as xt60?
[2022-04-26T20:42:12] Mirono escooters: Bad for phase current i guess
[2022-04-26T20:50:07] Mirono escooters: And 4mm?
[2022-04-26T20:54:33] Artem Bulashev: For stock vsett9 / 9+ May be ok yes
[2022-04-26T20:54:40] Artem Bulashev: For anything above def not
[2022-04-26T20:54:46] Luis Magalhaes: he is not using brake yet just throtlle, should choose current 😁
[2022-04-26T20:54:58] Artem Bulashev: That’s is why vsett 10+ is not using it
[2022-04-26T20:55:31] Artem Bulashev: Really hot connector can limit performance by 20% easy
[2022-04-26T20:57:59] Mirono escooters: Xiaomi controller but high phase Amps that's why i wondefed
[2022-04-26T20:59:29] sombre_enfant: High phase on xiaomi 🤨🤨
[2022-04-26T21:00:32] Mirono escooters: Yes. With a super modded controller and a different motor. And xiaodash
[2022-04-26T21:00:45] Mirono escooters: Why not experiment :) scooter modded. Bigger motor. ;)
[2022-04-26T21:02:21] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, then that maybe
[2022-04-26T21:02:40] Happy Giraffe: But not sure if it would still work
[2022-04-26T21:03:20] Luis Magalhaes: i think i did not do the input right but im talking to him too
[2022-04-26T21:03:48] Mirono escooters: Ok ill go 6mm and don't have worries xd Mr60 only 70a peak. :(
[2022-04-26T21:03:49] Luis Magalhaes: its the same scooter i have only the purple ubox and mine was the red 😁
[2022-04-26T21:05:02] sombre_enfant: Ait make it clean👍🏾
[2022-04-26T21:07:10] Unknown: Yup, 6mm xt150 bullets is what I use for my Vsett 10 motor phase connectors 👌. Just make sure the phase wire itself is touching one side of bullet. If centered only solder will be the conductor from wire thru bullet and solder is shit for conducting. I flattened the phase wire around the inside diameter of the bullet and then soldered to get most wire to bullet direct contact as possible. Problem is, 6mm bullet solder area is much larger diameter than 11-12awg phase wires... So if centered it just sort of floats in the center with solder being the only connection
[2022-04-26T21:09:17] Mirono escooters: Bet
[2022-04-26T21:09:40] Mirono escooters: 3mm copper wires everywhere :)) custom wires out of sides and xt60 😘
[2022-04-26T21:09:54] Mirono escooters: Next is a custom heatsinks but i cant Mill yet lol
[2022-04-26T21:11:40] sombre_enfant: Why mill machine like u cant drill by hand 2.5mm and thread (from my 43 year of work experience in machining)
[2022-04-26T21:12:13] Mirono escooters: Foe a custom bolt case ofcourse
[2022-04-26T21:12:14] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2022-04-26T21:12:16] Paolo ⁭: 60 peak
[2022-04-26T21:12:20] Paolo ⁭: Is 3.5mm
[2022-04-26T21:12:29] Mirono escooters: Maybe later. Let me see first how much A this controller handles
[2022-04-26T21:17:40] sombre_enfant: Xiaomi cant really wok with a lot current whatever the mod
[2022-04-26T21:18:16] Mirono escooters: With enouh mods it's capacable of a lot ;)
[2022-04-26T21:18:22] Mirono escooters: Just for testing. Nothing serious.
[2022-04-26T21:19:27] sombre_enfant: Bruv even Paolo Gabriele and Raphaël abandonned this project
[2022-04-26T21:22:35] Paolo ⁭: Xiaomi esc can handle too high current , up to 80A with double mosfet and modified resistor , but a simply not worth. The algorithm not good for high speed and power configurations, and not easy to unsolder and solder that much components🤧
[2022-04-26T21:23:01] Mirono escooters: Sooo?
[2022-04-26T21:23:21] Paolo ⁭: Get a flip sky and you have better performance👍
[2022-04-26T21:24:44] Mirono escooters: I have

[2022-04-26T21:25:24] Paolo ⁭: Idk how you did
[2022-04-26T21:25:48] Paolo ⁭: I use it at 150A
[2022-04-26T21:25:55] Paolo ⁭: Peaks of 170A
[2022-04-26T21:26:02] Paolo ⁭: Only mod is copper shunt 6W
[2022-04-26T21:26:02] sombre_enfant: Tightened nut like a femboy and shorted hall
[2022-04-26T21:26:31] sombre_enfant: U got référence of them ?
[2022-04-26T21:26:48] Mirono escooters: I told here
[2022-04-26T21:26:54] Mirono escooters: Halls got shorted..
[2022-04-26T21:27:26] Mirono escooters: That femboy wasnt needed, thanks I forgot i didnt tighten it good enough as it was a test build, got too exited and braked hard on ebrake :/
[2022-04-26T21:27:56] sombre_enfant: Mb bro
[2022-04-26T21:27:56] Mirono escooters: Hey that thing outlived many other vescs in this group at 150a phase And then killed itself due to user error with 5v
[2022-04-26T21:28:00] Mirono escooters: I Will problably fix it

[2022-04-26T21:29:09] Paolo ⁭: But that’s your error
[2022-04-26T21:29:29] Paolo ⁭: Or maybe solder balls, but when come from China always need check xd
[2022-04-26T21:30:31] Happy Giraffe: Som Ting Wong was the name of the guy who soldered our spintends

[2022-04-27T18:11:06] sombre_enfant: Noo
[2022-04-27T18:11:29] sombre_enfant: V2 tho i check if second is v2
[2022-04-27T18:14:45] sombre_enfant: Both are v2, so i can flash whatever i want and no amp limit ?
[2022-04-27T18:16:02] sombre_enfant: For copper shunt mod i put 3x the 6w one ?
[2022-04-27T18:22:11] Mirono escooters: Told you
[2022-04-27T18:22:16] Mirono escooters: It's great
[2022-04-27T18:22:21] Mirono escooters: Shunt mod?? Why?
[2022-04-27T18:22:30] Mirono escooters: You can just mod firmware for max that the mosfets can handle
[2022-04-27T18:24:01] Paolo ⁭: This will melt
[2022-04-27T18:24:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤮🤮
[2022-04-27T18:24:17] Paolo ⁭: Single shunt , don’t to this of you will burn
[2022-04-27T18:25:08] Paolo ⁭: Is too little 2W shunt for these currents
[2022-04-27T18:27:13] Artem Bulashev: What is that?
[2022-04-27T18:27:53] Mirono escooters: Ohh explains it. Xe
[2022-04-27T18:27:58] Mirono escooters: How much is Xiaomi shunt? 😂
[2022-04-27T18:28:03] Mirono escooters: 75100
[2022-04-27T18:28:17] Mirono escooters: Wich currents are we talking about?
[2022-04-27T18:28:28] Artem Bulashev: By what company?
[2022-04-27T18:28:44] Paolo ⁭: 120A peaked
[2022-04-27T18:28:45] Mirono escooters: Flipsky
[2022-04-27T18:28:54] Mirono escooters: And their shunt Too little? F
[2022-04-27T18:31:34] Artem Bulashev: Oh it is without casing
[2022-04-27T18:32:10] sombre_enfant: Yeah so 3x per phase copper one
[2022-04-27T18:32:10] Paolo ⁭: 120x120 / 0.0005 are 7w dissipated . Nominal capability is 2W
[2022-04-27T18:32:27] Paolo ⁭: No, 1 copper per phase is enough
[2022-04-27T18:32:39] Mirono escooters: Isn't it cooled by pcb
[2022-04-27T18:32:55] sombre_enfant: Need to recompile fw then no ? Or another ohm value ?
[2022-04-27T18:33:19] Paolo ⁭: Nope, if you buy 0.5mR version don’t need change anything
[2022-04-27T18:34:05] Paolo ⁭: But isn’t easy to solder copper shunt without fucking value hahaha
[2022-04-27T18:34:56] Mirono escooters: Oh how to do it good?
[2022-04-27T18:35:16] Paolo ⁭: Experience😂
[2022-04-27T18:35:45] sombre_enfant: On v2 stock its 3x like that stacked in//
[2022-04-27T18:36:03] Mirono escooters: Smart flipsky
[2022-04-27T18:36:17] sombre_enfant: Look 2w or 3w max
[2022-04-27T18:36:27] Mirono escooters: Poor shunts
[2022-04-27T18:36:33] Mirono escooters: But if 3w max it's 9w Total?
[2022-04-27T18:36:49] sombre_enfant: Yes
[2022-04-27T18:37:04] sombre_enfant: And lower résistance too
[2022-04-27T18:37:23] sombre_enfant: Thats why i dont get how paolo do it with a single one
[2022-04-27T18:38:35] Paolo ⁭: This is a v2 and only 1 shunt per phase
[2022-04-27T18:39:19] sombre_enfant: Look at my pic 3 shunt innit ?
[2022-04-27T18:41:10] Paolo ⁭: Bad job
[2022-04-27T18:41:29] Paolo ⁭: Their are down
[2022-04-27T18:41:39] Paolo ⁭: Copy design and made it worse 🤧
[2022-04-27T18:42:06] sombre_enfant: On yours it was only one, then they changed something in fw too, is it difficult to recalibrate shunt gain ?
[2022-04-27T18:42:41] Paolo ⁭: Each shunt should have their self dissipation surface, and in that way will produce more heat than a single copper 😬

[2022-04-27T21:24:38] Happy Giraffe: Yeahh but but not that much more
[2022-04-27T21:24:50] Happy Giraffe: If 3€ vs 4€ it's for capacity
[2022-04-27T21:28:29] Gigolo Joe: I actually push more, much more, this is from a stand still. It gives a shitton of power and scooter goes wheelie so u have to leave the throttle almost right away
[2022-04-27T21:31:43] Mirono escooters: Poor thing
[2022-04-27T21:31:52] Mirono escooters: Always Fun when u do wheelies from standstill power

[2022-04-27T22:30:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: up
[2022-04-27T22:30:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but if don't know anything about coding & compiling, it won't be so easy
[2022-04-27T22:32:18] Face de Pin Sucé: is it dual ?
[2022-04-27T22:40:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if it's single, it's damn good !

[2022-04-28T05:33:05] Gigolo Joe: This is from couple weeks ago when i did a speed test, phase was set to 170 max
[2022-04-28T08:14:43] Face de Pin Sucé: Did you change mos ? How possible 9kW on this ?
[2022-04-28T08:15:42] Gigolo Joe: Nope
[2022-04-28T08:16:16] Gigolo Joe: Can do even more... I'm on 16s, friend on 20s got much more
[2022-04-28T08:18:03] Gigolo Joe: 12kW
[2022-04-28T08:19:05] Gigolo Joe: Those numbers are just peak power for couple seconds, scooter on single motor is uncontrollable with this power from a stand still
[2022-04-28T08:21:07] Face de Pin Sucé: Do you run it for long rides with those parameters ?

[2022-04-28T08:24:07] Gigolo Joe: Motor stator goes up to 87c
[2022-04-28T08:24:09] Face de Pin Sucé: It's only 6 mos to-220 it's normal x)
[2022-04-28T08:24:19] Mirono escooters: Poor thing
[2022-04-28T08:24:50] Gigolo Joe: Motor is after a serious rewind, dude with same motor and nucular 12f is pushing 135 battery amp and 250 phase amps to it
[2022-04-28T08:25:16] Face de Pin Sucé: XD

[2022-04-28T11:36:41] Mirono escooters: A bluetooth battery would help
[2022-04-28T11:37:27] Gigolo Joe: The firmware is from Paolo. He sent it once here
[2022-04-28T11:39:02] Gigolo Joe: . This one iirc

[2022-04-28T11:48:09] Gigolo Joe: 🤷🏻‍♂️ He sent it for the v1 I'm one v1board, been using it for alsmost 4 months now (flashed right after he sent it), many kms since then, scooter rides great, controller does over heat(on low PA it seems to be ok), burned stock motor(10km speedrun without letting off the throttle on 140 PA and 95A field), but no other issues
[2022-04-28T11:50:23] Mirono escooters: Lol V1 and shunts survive?

[2022-04-28T14:23:43] Happy Giraffe: There has to be a limit what the size of scooter motor can do
[2022-04-28T14:25:00] Happy Giraffe: Can you bolt the mosfets straight into base of a cpu cooler or something?😂 Then have the finstack sticking out lol
[2022-04-28T14:25:36] Gigolo Joe: Yes
[2022-04-28T14:26:36] Gigolo Joe: Like dis?

[2022-04-28T14:27:47] Gigolo Joe: It helps yes, but on high currents u still get thermal throttling
[2022-04-28T14:27:58] Happy Giraffe: If you had a block of copper connected to fins
[2022-04-28T14:28:03] sombre_enfant: I mean the one who hold mosfet
[2022-04-28T14:28:24] Happy Giraffe: Usually cpu coolers baseplate is tiny, even the AMD TR4

[2022-04-28T22:34:44] Mirono escooters: And i know People that just abuse them so fucking hard
[2022-04-28T22:35:15] Mirono escooters: Mind 2 things Solid tires. Microcracks. Frame killer And Clone. Not pure aliminiumumum. Has uneven surface and more welds
[2022-04-28T22:46:41] Artem Bulashev: Could be yeah
[2022-04-28T22:46:52] Mirono escooters: Am sure
[2022-04-28T22:46:58] Mirono escooters: Solids are known to make microcracks
[2022-04-28T22:47:04] Mirono escooters: And the clones are already shit Quality
[2022-04-28T22:47:33] Mirono escooters: I haven't seen a official one snap Do i Mean they are made for it/ never snap? No But i do say that we shouldnt use Clone frames with solids as argument :)
[2022-04-28T23:24:08] Artem Bulashev: ✅🙂 Agee
[2022-04-28T23:24:18] Artem Bulashev: Though I have seen broken original once

[2022-04-29T12:40:59] Con Tassios: Is there information somewhere as to why Spintend is not recommending 5.3 firmware with their controllers?
[2022-04-29T12:41:50] Happy Giraffe: Not sure, they have issues with max absolute current
[2022-04-29T12:42:36] Happy Giraffe: You can use 5.3 but be sure to max out the custom fw limit of absolute current to 250A to avoid the error if it happens
[2022-04-29T12:44:28] Con Tassios: I've been using 5.3 with a ubox v2, haven't experienced any issues
[2022-04-29T12:45:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 5.3 on ubox v1 / usbc, but unlimited fw : no pb
[2022-04-29T12:47:16] Happy Giraffe: Spintend is bit silly with these
[2022-04-29T13:37:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: why ? at least they warn about a potential issue.
[2022-04-29T13:37:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: there was multiple reports according to them
[2022-04-29T13:37:34] Happy Giraffe: This issue was always present with single vesc

[2022-04-29T19:58:35] Luis Magalhaes: Strange mine only did this i talked when having modes to reduce power, i had to reduce the dead point of the throtlle and no they are always with a bit current
[2022-04-29T19:58:36] Luis Magalhaes: 😅
[2022-04-29T19:58:51] Luis Magalhaes: @PaoloWu did you do the identification?
[2022-04-29T19:59:08] Paolo ⁭: You mean set phase angle to 170 for auto detection?
[2022-04-29T19:59:39] Luis Magalhaes: Yes
[2022-04-29T19:59:54] Paolo ⁭: Yea I did
[2022-04-29T20:00:18] Luis Magalhaes: Mine was doing a strange noise even after the identification i did it again and it get silent again 😅
[2022-04-29T20:02:09] Luis Magalhaes: Try to reduce the tps dead low a bit until the motor receive some current even when not acelerating and test to see if it does it again 😅
[2022-04-29T20:02:18] Luis Magalhaes: I have mine at 16
[2022-04-29T20:02:35] Paolo ⁭: I did detection again but during detection motor doesn’t run more
[2022-04-29T20:02:44] Paolo ⁭: Can you share me your config please?

[2022-04-29T20:36:06] Gigolo Joe: It's not possible without making additional board with resistors
[2022-04-29T20:36:29] Paolo ⁭: Can be did but should be modified circuit
[2022-04-29T20:36:42] sombre_enfant: Yeah sure
[2022-04-29T20:37:09] Paolo ⁭: But I think this design don’t support that power
[2022-04-29T20:37:31] Mirono escooters: Poor vesc is good as is
[2022-04-29T20:37:46] sombre_enfant: If xiaomi made it it can...

[2022-04-29T20:38:24] Paolo ⁭: I still want to know how @Ghost_911 made 240A, 0.5Shunt can read max 180A
[2022-04-29T20:41:45] Happy Giraffe: What was your vesc power again? Is it only 18s?🌚
[2022-04-29T20:42:16] Mirono escooters: Why? Xd

[2022-04-29T20:44:37] Gigolo Joe: Good question
[2022-04-29T20:44:44] Mirono escooters: Magic
[2022-04-29T20:44:45] Gigolo Joe: Maybe vesc is lying idk

[2022-04-29T20:47:53] Gigolo Joe: 16s11p
[2022-04-29T20:47:59] Happy Giraffe: I assume no regen with 20s

[2022-04-29T20:49:06] Mirono escooters: Sounds good😂
[2022-04-29T20:49:07] Paolo ⁭: Should be tested
[2022-04-29T20:49:28] Paolo ⁭: The back emf is much limited because is added much tvs diodes and big capacitor
[2022-04-29T20:49:30] Happy Giraffe: I can test bit later in ~3 months🌚
[2022-04-29T20:49:34] Paolo ⁭: Then should be ok for ebikes

[2022-04-29T20:50:01] Happy Giraffe: 4T can create bit of an emf Im afraid
[2022-04-29T20:50:14] Mirono escooters: Let it sweat.

[2022-04-29T22:08:52] Gigolo Joe: Crazy to think I'm from chernigiv
[2022-04-29T22:09:17] Happy Giraffe: <animation>

[2022-04-29T22:24:50] Happy Giraffe: Oh, Palestine is the hardest topic out there😅
[2022-04-29T22:26:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: we'll try to avoid taking sides considering where all people are coming from, but i still 'pitty' people suffering from war.
[2022-04-29T22:44:32] Mirono escooters: Gg
[2022-04-29T22:53:07] Happy Giraffe: If anyone supports the war please never talk to me😂
[2022-04-29T22:53:33] Happy Giraffe: But it's as much as I want to say
[2022-04-29T22:59:42] sombre_enfant: Do a 5p 18650 of ncr18650bd would explode if i use 25A and 80A phase per motor the time i get stuff for battery ?
[2022-04-29T23:08:59] Happy Giraffe: They are rated at 10A and you would run them at 5A
[2022-04-29T23:25:00] sombre_enfant: Dual motor tho and only 13s or should i go jihad and external so have 10p
[2022-04-29T23:25:29] sombre_enfant: Its just till i figure out what i buy
[2022-04-29T23:26:51] Happy Giraffe: But if you use 25A per vesc/esc then its 50A no?
[2022-04-29T23:27:51] Happy Giraffe: Maybe 20A each then, should be enough with awd
[2022-04-29T23:36:17] sombre_enfant: It will be with blade first so it wont ride with that low amp
[2022-04-29T23:39:02] Happy Giraffe: For me I like 50/130A on single motor blade
[2022-04-29T23:39:45] Happy Giraffe: You could be fine with 40/100A or 20+20/80
[2022-04-29T23:54:37] Luis Magalhaes: Oh ok i was thinking it was yours
[2022-04-29T23:55:58] Paolo ⁭: Nono I don’t need that power lol
[2022-04-29T23:56:04] Paolo ⁭: I run 18s
[2022-04-29T23:56:11] Paolo ⁭: With high Kv motor easy 100kmh
[2022-04-29T23:56:21] Luis Magalhaes: 👌👌
[2022-04-29T23:56:46] Luis Magalhaes: I am running 16S with ubox i could do 100kmh too with kelly not yet
[2022-04-29T23:57:12] Luis Magalhaes: It push more amps to give that torque and the bms os the external battery overheats 😂
[2022-04-29T23:58:00] Paolo ⁭: How much max speed now
[2022-04-29T23:58:41] Happy Giraffe: Do you guys actually enjoy riding 80kmh+?🌚
[2022-04-29T23:58:56] Happy Giraffe: Afraid to die all the time?😂
[2022-04-29T23:59:09] Paolo ⁭: My Ducati (xiaomi clone) does 90kmh
[2022-04-29T23:59:18] Happy Giraffe: <animation>
[2022-04-29T23:59:45] Happy Giraffe: Crazy people
[2022-04-30T00:00:01] Paolo ⁭: Gg
[2022-04-30T00:31:48] Unknown: 80kmh is 50mph right? If so, I enjoy it very much 😝
[2022-04-30T00:32:31] Unknown: 95khm is starting to get a lil scary honestly LoL
[2022-04-30T01:09:21] Gigolo Joe: Yes

[2022-04-30T01:23:50] Face de Pin Sucé: It's SmartDisplay
[2022-04-30T01:26:35] Paolo ⁭: I remind it with different support
[2022-04-30T01:26:42] Paolo ⁭: One like minimotors
[2022-04-30T01:37:05] Luis Magalhaes: 88kmh 😂😂 but the battery cut power 😅
[2022-04-30T01:38:07] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2022-04-30T01:41:42] Paolo ⁭: How with vesc you was running higher speedG
[2022-04-30T01:41:43] Paolo ⁭: ?
[2022-04-30T01:45:21] Luis Magalhaes: On ubox i can use max 70Ax2 battery without cutting the bms
[2022-04-30T01:45:49] Luis Magalhaes: But on the kelly ot looks it overshoot the amps 😅
[2022-04-30T01:45:58] Luis Magalhaes: So more difficult to control
[2022-04-30T01:46:33] Luis Magalhaes: On ubox i just put 70A and it wont pass it even with high motor fase
[2022-04-30T01:46:38] Luis Magalhaes: Motor amps
[2022-04-30T01:47:08] Luis Magalhaes: In the kelly to reduce that overshoot i had to reduce motor amps 😅
[2022-04-30T01:52:42] Unknown: 64mph/103kmh max so far with no field weakening. Probably could've hit 67-68mph no FW but ran out of road and balls lol. 50mph/80kmh on pothole filled winding roads no problem (fast forward to 1 min in)
[2022-04-30T01:52:43] Unknown: <video_file>
[2022-04-30T01:58:35] Luis Magalhaes: 👌

[2022-04-30T08:18:29] Happy Giraffe: Wear protective glasses if you don't want nano particles in your eyes😂

[2022-04-30T11:31:56] Gigolo Joe: Will try and update how it goes
[2022-04-30T11:32:10] Gigolo Joe: Is this for v1 or v2?
[2022-04-30T11:33:14] Paolo ⁭: The same

[2022-04-30T12:48:46] Happy Giraffe: You can put the name of the vesc in (Flipsky 75100) to avoid confusion
[2022-04-30T16:08:11] Unknown: Usually you want to put the ferrofluid in the air gap while the stator is in place. Putting in the fluid first, when the stator snaps back into the hub, the fluid tends to splash out a bit since the stator usually gets sucked in super hard due to magnets. I don't have a fancy machine to ease the stator in the hub, so mine anyways gets sucked in like a banshee. Does anyone have a different method? LoL
[2022-04-30T16:20:53] Happy Giraffe: I would also put it from the side, if not it can splash everywhere😂 in your eyes
[2022-04-30T16:42:53] zekoslav mrkva: Dear Adam are you satisfied with motor phase connector?
[2022-04-30T18:16:38] Artem Bulashev: Here is a hack. Seat your ass and put rim between your feet. Now ease stator in more calmly.
[2022-04-30T18:17:05] Artem Bulashev: He is using xt150 on phases now
[2022-04-30T18:35:58] sombre_enfant: Work with v2 thanks Sir
[2022-04-30T18:36:15] Mirono escooters: V2 needs Diff shunt value no
[2022-04-30T18:37:01] Paolo ⁭: Pls compare with v1 if differences except shunt

[2022-04-30T18:43:51] Paolo ⁭: Flipsky no phase filter
[2022-04-30T18:43:58] sombre_enfant: He had 3shunt too if you look
[2022-04-30T18:44:26] sombre_enfant: I told him after if it was on but not before may he didnt knew
[2022-04-30T18:45:42] sombre_enfant: Seems easily repairable ngl, a track a buck and some mosfet, if refund come thru with some time he can

[2022-04-30T18:50:50] Mirko Boni: Si si rim
[2022-04-30T18:52:42] Unknown: He was asking about the Higo connector not the 6mm bullets. Xt150 6mm bullets have their own housings
[2022-04-30T18:54:21] Unknown: For my xt150 battery connectors I use the housings. For the xt150 phase bullets, I don't use the plastic housings, only heatshrink and seal seam/joint with kapton
[2022-04-30T18:54:21] Unknown: <photos/photo_3970@30-04-2022_18-54-21.jpg>
[2022-04-30T18:55:07] sombre_enfant: Are they compatible with other 6mm bullet or they dont match ?
[2022-04-30T18:55:45] Unknown: Oh oh.. I'm not really sure man. Sometimes the length will be different for male/female from brand to brand and diameter can be nominal, so diameter could be slightly off as well between brands
[2022-04-30T18:56:16] sombre_enfant: Oh alright
[2022-04-30T18:57:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: flipsky is funny, as usual 😁😁
[2022-04-30T18:58:40] Artem Bulashev: Yes but best to use same matching pair as they are optimized in diameter and length
[2022-04-30T18:59:00] Mirono escooters: What a setup
[2022-04-30T18:59:04] Mirko Boni: How come you panic?
[2022-04-30T18:59:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if i understood correctly : higo = original / juliet = "copy"
[2022-04-30T18:59:53] Mirko Boni: Do you have rims for me?
[2022-04-30T19:00:40] Unknown: There are genuine julet connectors but so many copies which have shit insulation, shit housings/pins and brittle wires.. I've been there lol. I use only genuine Higo 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-04-30T19:01:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: very interesting !
[2022-04-30T19:02:57] sombre_enfant: Wich of the 3 are better for phase ?
[2022-04-30T19:08:12] Unknown: I thought so too 🤓. I've played around with interchanging them and they do work, say Higo male to julet female. I didn't end up using the julets because I didn't like the quality of the housings (very soft and pliable plastic) and the wires were very brittle when I tried crimping them to JST pins. I bought all of my genuine Higo's from Kart... Along with my throttles

[2022-04-30T19:33:20] Unknown: Don't have a great shot of the front but follows the same route as stock wires. Same with the rear basically. 3X 6mm bullets with heatshrink/kapton and 6 pin Higo bundled together and wrapped with spiral wire wrap. Pretty simple really

[2022-04-30T19:34:38] Unknown: I also dissected a Higo L1019 connector lol. The 2.5mm solid bullets just aren't made to handle high currents. Artem also made a good point that they're solid bullets with no spring action, so male to female fitment isn't as tight as a typical bullet connector that has a split spring action on the male
[2022-04-30T19:35:42] Unknown: Nice thing about the Higo l1019 is the phase wires are 11awg (stock Vsett is 12awg) and there are 7 signals wires, so plenty for halls and temp sensor, all bundled into 1 single wire. Great wire but limited power with the actual connectors
[2022-04-30T19:37:22] Unknown: I think pulling 220 phase amps and 80 battery amps on my rear motor alone (135/75 for front) would have been a little much for the 2.5mm solid bullets LoL
[2022-04-30T19:47:03] zekoslav mrkva: have you some differences between old and xt150 new one connectors
[2022-04-30T19:48:32] zekoslav mrkva: Great job my man, great, excellent job

[2022-04-30T23:01:00] Paolo ⁭: Not yet, maybe is for battery current limit , idk . I’ve set to 35A , I’ve put 35A fuse for avoid fireworks
[2022-04-30T23:01:31] Gigolo Joe: I installed a v2 version today(not on mine scooter), seems to heat much less on same power levels as the v1
[2022-04-30T23:01:52] Mirono escooters: Does a fuse cause vdrop?
[2022-04-30T23:01:54] Mirono escooters: Noticable
[2022-04-30T23:04:01] Paolo ⁭: Which one? And where?
[2022-04-30T23:05:16] Luis Magalhaes: Strange.. i was using 85% battery and 100% motor the bms shut down when i push it a little, i reduced battery to 30% with 100% motor and it worked but shutdown again when going more speed, then i reduced motor to 80% and it goes till 85kmh and then the external shutdowns i see 90+ on the smart bms of the internal battery , but nothing similar to your 😅

[2022-04-30T23:14:53] Gigolo Joe: I know
[2022-04-30T23:15:02] Gigolo Joe: Jaykup made it
[2022-04-30T23:22:38] Unknown: NAMI uses the Higo L1019 wire and connectors? I didn't know that. Seems like any power setup these connectors would create a bottleneck, which is why I cut mine off and put 6mm bullets. Beautiful connectors and super clean but think about it, 2.5mm bullets. @artBula I'm sure you have some info on how many amps a 2.5mm bullet is capable of handling, even on AC current
[2022-04-30T23:23:59] Unknown: Again, the wire is beefy but I have doubts about the connector itself handling 150+ phase amps without heating up or creating a large resistance in the flow of current
[2022-04-30T23:24:45] Unknown: <photos/photo_3981@30-04-2022_23-24-45.jpg>
[2022-04-30T23:27:27] Unknown: 2mm bullet connectors = 20a Higo L1019 spec sheet says 45a... I have run mine on 60a battery and around 160a phase (per motor/connector) and it wasn't hot but... There is definitely some sort of resistance/bottlenecking happening even at those currents. I've been running even higher than that lately, so I'm glad I switched them out
[2022-04-30T23:28:51] Oliver Eliasson: Also maybe some basic good for beginners information on vesc
[2022-04-30T23:29:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: very difficult.
[2022-04-30T23:29:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if you want basics, there are already a lot of youtube videos
[2022-04-30T23:30:01] Oliver Eliasson: Yeah true
[2022-04-30T23:30:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but vesc are highly configurable and with differents hardwares (not the same IOs)
[2022-04-30T23:31:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's difficult to define a generic setup (i am trying tonfor the logic part for my display... far from easy)
[2022-05-01T00:03:43] Happy Giraffe: 2.5mm is maybe ok for xiaomi😂
[2022-05-01T00:39:26] Artem Bulashev: I Highly doubt they would be using such low power 45a rated max connector for no real reason

[2022-05-01T03:32:02] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, maybe I want 8mm just to be safe🤔
[2022-05-01T03:32:36] Happy Giraffe: Will be 100/250 or maxing out Paolo vesc🌚
[2022-05-01T03:34:30] Happy Giraffe: Sounds more like it, still a bit meh 45A continuous
[2022-05-01T03:34:36] Unknown: If you can fit them, bigger is always better 😉
[2022-05-01T03:34:53] Unknown: Less resistance less heat and less bottleneck
[2022-05-01T03:35:45] Happy Giraffe: Yep, that's what I got now. One reason less for hitting overcurrent....
[2022-05-01T03:35:51] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-05-01T04:48:10] sombre_enfant: Phase filter probably nothing has really changed or fw inacuracy from the 3 shunt
[2022-05-01T05:31:27] Gigolo Joe: Completely normal phenomenon
[2022-05-01T05:33:42] Gigolo Joe: Don't be so sure about it, i burned 2 v1's during normal acceleration, all was good, burned without a visible reason, it happens, after all you can't expect too much from a 100$ esc
[2022-05-01T12:00:23] Artem Bulashev: What settings they burned with ?
[2022-05-01T12:02:07] Gigolo Joe: 1) 130a phase, 60a battery, 50a field weakening 2) 140a phase, 60a battery, 60a field
[2022-05-01T12:02:43] Gigolo Joe: Had one that burned during motor detection
[2022-05-01T12:04:51] rosheee: 60A FW xD
[2022-05-01T12:06:27] rosheee: 1x QS8 190A phase per motor 200A current max 2x95A battery HXT6mm
[2022-05-01T13:01:58] Gigolo Joe: 60a fw is nothing mah dude
[2022-05-01T13:02:55] Gigolo Joe: My daily setup is 181a phase 115a battery 60a fw
[2022-05-01T14:18:13] rosheee: U told me xD i sjit myself at 35A
[2022-05-01T14:18:18] rosheee: Cuz i dunno max
[2022-05-01T15:28:51] Artem Bulashev: This is like l1019
[2022-05-01T15:28:57] Artem Bulashev: But 6mm bullet
[2022-05-01T15:29:08] Artem Bulashev: It is not for sale any where that I saw
[2022-05-01T15:55:49] Unknown: Higo L1019
[2022-05-01T15:56:07] Artem Bulashev: Yeah but that is not it
[2022-05-01T15:56:12] Unknown: No?
[2022-05-01T15:56:25] Unknown: Oh yea... No threads
[2022-05-01T15:56:29] Artem Bulashev: Didn t some one say they use 6mm bullet?
[2022-05-01T15:56:32] Unknown: Simple pressure fit
[2022-05-01T15:56:40] Artem Bulashev: And that as well
[2022-05-01T15:56:57] Artem Bulashev: Design is similar but custom model I think
[2022-05-01T15:57:12] Unknown: Gotcha.
[2022-05-01T15:57:28] Unknown: Does what use 6mm bullets? That connector in the picture?
[2022-05-01T15:58:31] Artem Bulashev: Nami uses 6mm bullets
[2022-05-01T15:58:58] Unknown: Oh oh.. I see
[2022-05-01T15:59:12] Artem Bulashev: So if there is another interconnection I don’t think that those connectors would be smaller than other (6mm bullet)
[2022-05-01T15:59:27] Unknown: That is the NAMI connector in the picture?
[2022-05-01T16:00:04] Unknown: I see NAMI in the background (I think) but wonder if that's stock or custom
[2022-05-01T16:01:09] Unknown: This is Higo L1019 connectors. I had them but replaced the connector with 6mm bullets. Phase wires are 11awg and 7 signal wires. Excellent wire but connector can be limited in high power applications
[2022-05-01T17:50:40] rosheee: My vesc app disconnects all after connect
[2022-05-01T18:00:45] Happy Giraffe: Wait 5 seconds after turning vesc on
[2022-05-01T18:01:17] Happy Giraffe: Previously I could instantly connect but now I gotta wait for some reason
[2022-05-01T18:01:22] rosheee: Ah 0 wait
[2022-05-01T18:01:33] rosheee: Only when look at data
[2022-05-01T18:01:45] rosheee: Yah xD and the 16S5P is history
[2022-05-01T18:01:48] Happy Giraffe: Oh, then I have no idea
[2022-05-01T18:01:58] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-05-01T18:02:02] rosheee: Sold
[2022-05-01T18:02:14] rosheee: 16S6P 150A bms with molicel ^_^
[2022-05-01T18:02:31] rosheee: And finally the new masterblaster next week
[2022-05-01T18:02:39] rosheee: Kaabo wohoohohoo
[2022-05-01T18:02:48] rosheee: Better the 16S5P is gone
[2022-05-01T18:04:38] sombre_enfant: Why from 17 to 16s?
[2022-05-01T18:07:38] rosheee: Because daily
[2022-05-01T18:07:44] rosheee: And vesc to big
[2022-05-01T18:07:50] rosheee: And i dont need the extra speed
[2022-05-01T18:07:55] rosheee: And expensive
[2022-05-01T18:08:19] rosheee: 96x 5.x euro for cells
[2022-05-01T18:08:24] rosheee: Then 120 euro bms
[2022-05-01T18:08:34] rosheee: Then work, material and shipping xD
[2022-05-01T18:09:13] rosheee: I get 20S7P next week
[2022-05-01T18:09:44] rosheee: End of year i wanna get 22S or 23S8-10P
[2022-05-01T18:10:14] Happy Giraffe: Which cells? Molicel? How much was it?
[2022-05-01T18:10:32] Happy Giraffe: Im doing quite similar setup for my bike
[2022-05-01T18:11:00] rosheee: Ah no It is stock battery
[2022-05-01T18:11:38] rosheee: Samsung 50E cells
[2022-05-01T18:12:10] rosheee: Keep stock esc n stuff until it gets booring
[2022-05-01T18:12:16] rosheee: And i need new esc anyway.
[2022-05-01T18:12:55] rosheee: First get the scooter
[2022-05-01T18:13:16] rosheee: Good vesc would be nice
[2022-05-01T18:13:18] Happy Giraffe: 10A...
[2022-05-01T18:13:28] rosheee: I know
[2022-05-01T18:13:33] rosheee: 16S5P also xD
[2022-05-01T18:13:40] rosheee: But 150A peak eZ
[2022-05-01T18:13:52] Happy Giraffe: Didnt you buy a proper battery from Tudor?
[2022-05-01T18:13:56] rosheee: Yes
[2022-05-01T18:14:01] rosheee: All
[2022-05-01T18:14:10] rosheee: But what is ur question?
[2022-05-01T18:14:12] rosheee: 17S sold
[2022-05-01T18:14:15] rosheee: 16S sold
[2022-05-01T18:14:19] rosheee: New 16S in progress
[2022-05-01T18:14:26] Happy Giraffe: And molicel?
[2022-05-01T18:14:33] rosheee: Yes that is 16S6P
[2022-05-01T18:14:39] Happy Giraffe: 👍
[2022-05-01T18:14:54] rosheee: Maybe samsung 50S for 22S
[2022-05-01T18:15:02] rosheee: Idk
[2022-05-01T18:15:06] rosheee: We will see
[2022-05-01T18:15:19] rosheee: But no more new stuff until then
[2022-05-01T18:15:33] Happy Giraffe: That will cost you arm and leg lol
[2022-05-01T18:15:45] rosheee: Yes xD that is why i wait
[2022-05-01T18:15:55] rosheee: 12 euro lol per cell
[2022-05-01T18:16:10] Happy Giraffe: 40T <4€
[2022-05-01T18:16:26] rosheee: Yah but i want 5000mah per cell
[2022-05-01T18:16:40] rosheee: If possible
[2022-05-01T18:17:07] Happy Giraffe: Just buy a second 40T battery and swap it on road😂
[2022-05-01T18:17:12] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-05-01T18:17:30] rosheee: I thought about adding solarpanels
[2022-05-01T18:17:36] rosheee: And buy solarpanel suit
[2022-05-01T18:17:55] Happy Giraffe: You realize how much space you need for any meaningful power?😅
[2022-05-01T18:18:16] Happy Giraffe: Otherwise could have solarpanel on scooter footrest😂
[2022-05-01T18:18:19] rosheee: Add some rear spoiler and front downforce optim.
[2022-05-01T18:18:26] rosheee: I know xD just joking
[2022-05-01T18:19:09] Happy Giraffe: If I lived in California I would have a portable solar panel system on my backpack to charge my batt. So easy in there
[2022-05-01T18:19:58] Artem Bulashev: How many amps per cell you would need ?
[2022-05-01T18:27:49] Happy Giraffe: Hes going to suggest you into buying 48x😁
[2022-05-01T18:28:18] Unknown: All depends on amps. 48X are amazing cells but all depends on amp draw and P count
[2022-05-01T18:31:16] Unknown: My battery has around 300 miles on it so far and I have not needed to balance the cells once, ever. Active balancer stays off. Charged at 6a this morning and delta never exceeded .004v. Resting is usually .002v - .005v delta with no balancing ever. Pretty impressive
[2022-05-01T18:33:55] Unknown: Even after hard 140a battery ride from 4.15v to 3.6v... resting delta never exceeded .007v and quickly settles even lower than that, usually between .001v and .005v. Active balancer is off, so it's not kicking on with me not knowing.
[2022-05-01T18:34:51] Happy Giraffe: Have you measured total sag under different loads?
[2022-05-01T18:35:18] Unknown: Absolutely. Real time Nucular display, can easily see sag as I ride real time
[2022-05-01T18:35:32] Happy Giraffe: Might be worth doing a small test
[2022-05-01T18:39:00] Unknown: 130a is around 6v sag or so. Most I've ever seen was mid 7 volts at 150a batt. Typical riding is around 2-5v but can hit the 6-7v mark when I punch it for a long high speed straightaway. Really solid performance for 9P. Cell temp probes never rose above 27C/80F which is also really good for a sealed battery and sealed deck
[2022-05-01T18:43:58] sombre_enfant: The 48x evangelist😂
[2022-05-01T18:45:50] rosheee: Never
[2022-05-01T18:46:08] rosheee: I have less at 180a with 6p
[2022-05-01T18:46:13] rosheee: So i never go 48x
[2022-05-01T18:46:51] rosheee: Also never over 27C so far
[2022-05-01T18:47:16] rosheee: 50S, 42 moli or something with min. 30A
[2022-05-01T18:49:43] Paolo ⁭: Yes but one is high range and life cell, another short life and less capacity
[2022-05-01T18:49:45] Paolo ⁭: Normal
[2022-05-01T18:49:55] Unknown: You said you wanted 5000mah. Unfortunately can't have both 5000mah and 30a
[2022-05-01T18:50:06] Paolo ⁭: 50S
[2022-05-01T18:50:09] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-05-01T18:50:30] Happy Giraffe: 💸💸💸💸💸💸
[2022-05-01T18:50:34] Unknown: For millions
[2022-05-01T18:50:56] Happy Giraffe: 50S is anciant greek gods myth
[2022-05-01T18:51:33] Unknown: Would've cost me $2300 in cells alone for 20s9p 180 quantity. I don't think that's very realistic for many of us here
[2022-05-01T18:51:40] Unknown: Using $100 Flipsky
[2022-05-01T18:53:08] Artem Bulashev: 50s is like 23a cell (before 10% voltage sag) vs 48x is ideal for 14a load (10% sag)
[2022-05-01T18:54:32] rosheee: I got millions
[2022-05-01T18:54:36] Unknown: <animation>
[2022-05-01T18:55:03] Artem Bulashev: Damm I was offered it before at 4.3€, but not in stock
[2022-05-01T18:55:09] rosheee: Bur i need 2x 90A
[2022-05-01T18:55:20] rosheee: Yes xFD not stock
[2022-05-01T18:55:23] Artem Bulashev: How many P battery?
[2022-05-01T18:55:24] rosheee: For 4.3 send instant
[2022-05-01T18:55:25] Happy Giraffe: I would buy it in hartbeat for under 4.5€
[2022-05-01T18:55:33] rosheee: Idk yet xD
[2022-05-01T18:55:34] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-05-01T18:55:45] rosheee: First have to receive scooter
[2022-05-01T18:55:54] Artem Bulashev: Yeah my sale price was + 1€ = 5.3 But not stock now :(
[2022-05-01T18:56:06] Happy Giraffe: Still good enough👍
[2022-05-01T18:56:07] Paolo ⁭: I’ve 8-9v sag at 200A with 7p config
[2022-05-01T18:56:21] Artem Bulashev: 50s?
[2022-05-01T18:56:27] Artem Bulashev: How many S ?
[2022-05-01T18:56:43] Paolo ⁭: 21s
[2022-05-01T18:56:53] Paolo ⁭: Nope, Sony
[2022-05-01T18:57:00] Artem Bulashev: So that’s about 10%
[2022-05-01T18:57:08] Paolo ⁭: Controllers 2 x 150 A sabvoton 72150
[2022-05-01T18:57:39] Artem Bulashev: So my estimation was that you would have such sag at 7*23= 161a
[2022-05-01T18:58:22] Artem Bulashev: 200a/7p= 28a that’s impressively 5a more than I expected from them
[2022-05-01T18:58:26] Artem Bulashev: Nice
[2022-05-01T18:58:28] Paolo ⁭: Unfortunately not, was 193A exactly reading
[2022-05-01T18:58:49] Artem Bulashev: Have log screenshoot?
[2022-05-01T18:59:09] Paolo ⁭: Sabvoton no log, shunt not too 😂.
[2022-05-01T18:59:46] Artem Bulashev: = 27.5a still 4.5a more than I expected may be sag was more like 9-10v ?
[2022-05-01T18:59:53] Artem Bulashev: So I would say def 25a cell than (before going over 10% sag)
[2022-05-01T19:00:26] Paolo ⁭: 9v yes, 10v no
[2022-05-01T19:00:33] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2022-05-01T19:01:03] Artem Bulashev: Still that battery is over 88v full charge so, close to 10%
[2022-05-01T19:01:17] rosheee: With 50G and 5P i have 10-15V at 150a xD
[2022-05-01T19:01:19] Artem Bulashev: Very nice
[2022-05-01T19:01:25] Paolo ⁭: That was the shunt I used to measure current, it’s very accurately
[2022-05-01T19:02:09] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-05-01T19:02:13] Artem Bulashev: What you expect from 10a cell 😂😂 doing 30a
[2022-05-01T19:02:41] Happy Giraffe: Does sabvoton have a power limited option in addition to the wires for 25kmh?
[2022-05-01T19:02:57] Happy Giraffe: Can you program the parameters of the slow speed mode?
[2022-05-01T19:03:18] Paolo ⁭: Idk, I never interest these things hahaha
[2022-05-01T19:03:34] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-05-01T19:07:17] Happy Giraffe: Any vesc updates? When do you estimate it to be available?
[2022-05-01T19:07:44] Artem Bulashev: 50g is identical performance at max (amps 15a) to 58x, only after 12wh down to 3v 50g has extra 0.75wh = 5% range Sag and voltage drop and heating so same. Don’t know how they don’t blow up at 30a
[2022-05-01T19:07:44] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_3987@01-05-2022_19-07-44.jpg>
[2022-05-01T21:25:10] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_3988@01-05-2022_21-25-10.jpg>
[2022-05-01T21:25:21] rosheee: Me neither
[2022-05-01T21:25:23] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't look at max speed
[2022-05-01T21:25:40] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-05-01T21:28:16] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2022-05-01T21:38:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I think you got the record of this group for now. 18kW with VESC...
[2022-05-01T21:38:34] rosheee: Word
[2022-05-01T21:38:38] rosheee: What used?
[2022-05-01T21:38:44] Face de Pin Sucé: Oh, well, let's hit 20kW tomorrow then
[2022-05-01T21:38:47] rosheee: 5kw more than my peak
[2022-05-01T21:38:49] rosheee: With whatM
[2022-05-01T21:38:53] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-05-01T21:39:35] Face de Pin Sucé: 70mm motors ^^
[2022-05-01T21:39:53] Face de Pin Sucé: But didn't reach max speed so, can do much better
[2022-05-01T21:43:38] Кирилл: So.. that was about 37V on bat with sag? wtf ahah👍
[2022-05-01T21:44:21] Face de Pin Sucé: Where do you see the voltage ?
[2022-05-01T21:44:52] Кирилл: W / A = V
[2022-05-01T21:45:09] Face de Pin Sucé: You don't have battery current
[2022-05-01T21:45:19] Кирилл: Thats motors, yes, sorry
[2022-05-01T21:45:21] Face de Pin Sucé: Only phase current so you can't calculate
[2022-05-01T21:46:32] Кирилл: Ok, so there was 37V phase emf on the motor at that moment
[2022-05-01T21:47:33] Face de Pin Sucé: No no, you don't know if max phase current shown on picture happened at 18Kw x)
[2022-05-01T21:47:44] Face de Pin Sucé: I didn't log so we can't know
[2022-05-01T21:47:54] Face de Pin Sucé: It's only about max values
[2022-05-01T21:49:26] rosheee: 500A xD
[2022-05-01T21:49:29] rosheee: What esc?
[2022-05-01T21:49:50] Paolo ⁭: His own
[2022-05-01T21:50:13] Кирилл: Lets go 1000A
[2022-05-01T21:50:29] Кирилл: to the moon and back😁
[2022-05-01T21:50:39] Paolo ⁭: This isn’t impressive, the real impressive stats is @Ghost_911 one with more than 10kw on flipsky ahahah
[2022-05-01T21:51:48] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes this is impressive x)
[2022-05-01T21:51:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😂😂😂

[2022-05-02T00:32:31] Happy Giraffe: Does your vesc support KTY83 motor temperature sensor?🌚
[2022-05-02T00:33:03] rosheee: Omfg
[2022-05-02T00:35:35] Paolo ⁭: 10k or 100k?
[2022-05-02T00:38:25] Happy Giraffe: The sensor in QS205, Im noob in these with no knowledge
[2022-05-02T00:52:13] Unknown: Kty83 is very different than NTC (negative temp coefficient) 10k/100k. It uses very different resistance values. Nuc can select either and when I select kty83 (with NTC 10k installed) I think I had like 1400F LoL. Just different type of sensor. Not sure about VESC reading it
[2022-05-02T00:54:34] Paolo ⁭: Yes vesc support this
[2022-05-02T00:54:53] Paolo ⁭: Wtf 1k ntc, will be very accurately
[2022-05-02T00:58:46] Unknown: Kty 81/83/84, NTC 10k/100k and PT1000 are the common temp sensors. I imagine VESC would support them 👍
[2022-05-02T01:06:35] Mirko Boni: Hello everyone! Today I finished the G30 and rode it for the first time after all the changes!
[2022-05-02T01:07:48] Mirko Boni: Is fantastic! Magura brakes are the top! The engine has a great speed!
[2022-05-02T01:09:19] Mirko Boni: The motor is an 800w bought by Paolo Wu!
[2022-05-02T01:12:00] Mirko Boni: <video_file>

[2022-05-02T02:43:35] Happy Giraffe: Then I can bOOst the 5T version for insane torque and not having to fear cooking it
[2022-05-02T02:44:24] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_3991@02-05-2022_02-44-24.jpg>
[2022-05-02T02:44:43] Happy Giraffe: I'm an idiot, could just have looked
[2022-05-02T02:45:19] Paolo ⁭: 5T is really high Kv, I think 250 phase not enough
[2022-05-02T02:45:36] Happy Giraffe: It's 9kv in QS205
[2022-05-02T02:46:04] Happy Giraffe: 72v 9kv with 18" tire 55kmh😂
[2022-05-02T02:46:23] Paolo ⁭: Only 18” tire?
[2022-05-02T02:46:23] Happy Giraffe: But massive torque
[2022-05-02T02:46:34] Happy Giraffe: Motorcycle tire
[2022-05-02T02:46:49] Paolo ⁭: Then not 28
[2022-05-02T02:46:50] Paolo ⁭: Xd
[2022-05-02T02:47:25] Happy Giraffe: Bicycle tires and rims too weak for QS
[2022-05-02T02:47:33] Happy Giraffe: Its a monster if you put 5T
[2022-05-02T02:48:11] Paolo ⁭: Oh then isn’t version with higher Kv
[2022-05-02T02:48:18] Happy Giraffe: Sadly QS doesnt exist in motor simulator but its similar to Cromotor
[2022-05-02T02:48:27] Happy Giraffe: 3T- 6T
[2022-05-02T02:48:52] Happy Giraffe: But I don't need speed, I do enduro offroad
[2022-05-02T02:49:30] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-05-02T02:52:32] Happy Giraffe: 250Nm torque for 18" wheel, insanity
[2022-05-02T02:53:28] Happy Giraffe: Now my blade motor is around 50-60Nm, ofcourse wheel is smaller so less torque needed for acceleration. But QS will be 3x🌚
[2022-05-02T02:53:47] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-05-02T02:53:53] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-05-02T02:54:27] Paolo ⁭: Blade motor is rated 30nm around
[2022-05-02T02:55:03] Happy Giraffe: 130A phase should make it to ~50 I think
[2022-05-02T02:55:46] Happy Giraffe: If you use 48v30A battery current on china esc then its maybe 30nm
[2022-05-02T02:57:28] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-05-02T02:59:34] Happy Giraffe: Thats how they rate them no?😂

[2022-05-02T21:43:41] Happy Giraffe: I read people having wrong hall/phase combos on Kelly
[2022-05-02T21:43:49] Happy Giraffe: It doesn't always match the color
[2022-05-02T21:45:37] Paolo ⁭: What means
[2022-05-02T21:46:21] Happy Giraffe: I go buy food, will search it for you later

[2022-05-02T22:49:35] Gigolo Joe: 😅😅😅
[2022-05-02T22:51:10] Paolo ⁭: If he solved with this method means kelly software is very very shit
[2022-05-02T22:51:18] Paolo ⁭: Controller don’t detect anything
[2022-05-02T22:54:58] Happy Giraffe: Sadly I think its this😅

[2022-05-02T23:00:12] Paolo ⁭: Or easily I got yyk square wave
[2022-05-02T23:03:12] Happy Giraffe: Was the motor hot also?
[2022-05-02T23:03:26] Happy Giraffe: Or hotter than it should?
[2022-05-02T23:04:10] Paolo ⁭: Mhhh motor cover not , but phase wire and connector very much, controller too
[2022-05-02T23:04:30] Paolo ⁭: 8mm bullet was very hot that you can’t touch it
[2022-05-02T23:07:12] Happy Giraffe: Hmm try it

[2022-05-02T23:52:47] sombre_enfant: I ordered 6w shunt btw i didnt seen i could add stuff on processing order on lcsc🥸 so dont worry for firmware if it works v2 and 6w it was for other ppl
[2022-05-02T23:55:06] Unknown: I have read about this optimal phase/hall combo as well. Kelly and a few other Chinese controllers if I remember correctly
[2022-05-02T23:58:22] Unknown: Shit software. I remember reading a post from someone on endless where they had to try a handful of combinations before they found the "right" combo 🤦🏻. I forget which controller... Maybe votol EM*** .. not sure exactly. But am sure I've read about this more than once
[2022-05-03T00:02:18] Unknown: Quick search on endless finds many many discussions regarding this

[2022-05-03T00:08:13] Happy Giraffe: And profile that goes online after reboot...
[2022-05-03T00:09:00] Happy Giraffe: For real do they not think police is interested sometimes when their gayporn video is buffering
[2022-05-03T00:09:59] Happy Giraffe: A profile with speed and power limit really needed🌚
[2022-05-03T00:11:07] Luis Magalhaes: Adam mine did run in first try after some halls replacement 🤣
[2022-05-03T00:11:47] Luis Magalhaes: one of the motors was noisy when i change one hall sensor but the halls test resolve it
[2022-05-03T00:14:16] Paolo ⁭: Do you think I need only change phase position or hall needed too?
[2022-05-03T00:14:33] Paolo ⁭: Yes I really think that can be cause of all
[2022-05-03T00:24:04] Happy Giraffe: Can you test hall with bluetooth detection?
[2022-05-03T00:24:18] Happy Giraffe: If it can spin motor slowly then should be correct no?
[2022-05-03T00:24:27] Luis Magalhaes: no
[2022-05-03T00:24:36] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-05-03T00:24:47] Luis Magalhaes: theres a combination that spins motor but push too much amps
[2022-05-03T00:25:13] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, interesting
[2022-05-03T00:25:28] Luis Magalhaes: i would start changing halls position cables first and see if it get better
[2022-05-03T00:26:01] Happy Giraffe: But there has to be someone else with same issue
[2022-05-03T00:26:11] Happy Giraffe: If you do exactly as the guy with Mxus perhaps

[2022-05-03T19:07:42] Paolo ⁭: I bought a pair , if Kelly not works
[2022-05-03T19:09:27] Luis Magalhaes: Be careful ykz had the sam problem with the right halls connection 😅
[2022-05-03T19:10:10] Luis Magalhaes: I have a friend that has 2 scooters one with ykz 7280 and other with kelly
[2022-05-03T19:11:00] Paolo ⁭: Yes but you don’t need do hall check when you change configuration
[2022-05-03T19:11:09] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-05-03T19:11:17] Luis Magalhaes: The ykz scooter had that problem the cables where getting too hot, it got so hot that melted the isolation and did a short-circuit in the fase wire 😅
[2022-05-03T19:11:40] Paolo ⁭: What make hot? Controller cable or motor?
[2022-05-03T19:12:00] Luis Magalhaes: Halls and fase order of conection 😅
[2022-05-03T19:12:41] Luis Magalhaes: Thats why i was asking how much battery amps the scooter push with the wheels in air
[2022-05-03T19:13:15] Luis Magalhaes: He was pushing many amps and after the right combination it push less amps in air
[2022-05-03T19:13:46] Luis Magalhaes: Theres no reason to push many amps in air , no force is applied
[2022-05-03T19:14:05] Luis Magalhaes: Only in aceleration then goes down
[2022-05-03T19:14:21] Paolo ⁭: He did only phase combination of hall too?
[2022-05-03T19:14:43] Paolo ⁭: I tried all phase combination and no success
[2022-05-03T19:14:49] Luis Magalhaes: Dont remember but theres 32 combination in halls and phase wires 😅
[2022-05-03T19:14:53] Unknown: Haha. I'm thinking it but didn't want to say it and start a war again 😂😂
[2022-05-03T19:15:33] Luis Magalhaes: Nucular has identification angle 😁👌
[2022-05-03T19:51:13] Happy Giraffe: I call RS if you do😂
[2022-05-03T19:51:23] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-05-03T19:53:33] Unknown: Of course. Auto angle detection and auto phase/hall orientation detection. Just like VESC does. I was thinking more along the lines of hardware/software quality comments LoL. Those guys basically did what Sucé and Paolo are doing... They created their own hardware but took it a step further and created their own software as well. Then they made it available to the public in small limited batches with high quality control. He was a guy with an idea and ended up creating a system of products that turned out to be extremely robust, user friendly and capable. Then they also decided to start a telegram chat with live 24/7 support.
[2022-05-03T19:55:17] Paolo ⁭: I think they do these little batch because same as me I have fear that Chinese company copy you pcb and sell .
[2022-05-03T19:56:41] Unknown: I think many people think they this big business with a factory. It's quite the opposite. It would be like Paolo making his own VESC and then branching out to start making them in larger batches available to the public. If He ends up creating a very successful design and finds supplier to make that design affordable, he now has a full time job as controller manufacturer out of his home, hires a software engineer and only makes quality products.
[2022-05-03T20:09:39] Unknown: Definitely one reason I'm sure. They also build them by hand to keep quality control tight. They offer 2 year warranty on non-potted and 3 year on potted controllers. Not sure if any other company out there has a controller built that robust to offer that sort of thing. I have been a member of their endless sphere chat and telegram chat for about 9 months and I have literally never heard of one failure just because and there are thousands of units in daily use, maybe ten thousand plus. There have been some firmware bugs here n there but those are usually corrected with a patch in short order. What I can say is, they (he, just a guy... like John at spintend) started out just like Paolo. A guy who wanted a controller better than what's currently out there. He turned that idea into a very successful business with a very successful line of products and firmwares to match, which is not an easy thing to do at all. And then you have no-brainers bashing them lol. They have accomplished what very few can in this niche hobby of ours.
[2022-05-03T20:24:59] rosheee: maybe when i have new scooter i try that besc proejct or something similar order pcb order the rest give it to my friend 😆let him assemble then lets go and test
[2022-05-03T20:26:24] Happy Giraffe: You need to hire Chinese bounty killer
[2022-05-03T20:38:15] Paolo ⁭: Besc project is a really complex to assemble , also the cost of components are very high . No sense on e scooter, need only in big ebike I think
[2022-05-03T20:38:31] rosheee: the guy can assemble that
[2022-05-03T20:40:30] Nome: Hi guys, some of you created a new release of the last Vesc 6.0 for Flipsky 75100V201 (White Circuit Board)??

[2022-05-03T21:00:04] Paolo ⁭: All components
[2022-05-03T21:00:15] rosheee: How much xD
[2022-05-03T21:00:22] rosheee: +/-
[2022-05-03T21:00:51] Paolo ⁭: Idk, only the pcb cost arround 100€, because min order is 5 PCs
[2022-05-03T21:01:01] Paolo ⁭: Should be with thick copper
[2022-05-03T21:01:24] rosheee: Ok

[2022-05-03T22:30:15] Paolo ⁭: But I mean useless
[2022-05-03T22:30:26] Paolo ⁭: Performance tire should be used at low pressure
[2022-05-03T22:30:27] Gigolo Joe: Going tubeless is not very hard process. But why should i? Any major advantages?
[2022-05-03T22:30:31] Gigolo Joe: Oh

[2022-05-03T22:38:38] Paolo ⁭: I think all with yellow logo are fixed
[2022-05-03T22:38:39] Paolo ⁭: Idk
[2022-05-03T22:43:36] Unknown: My non yellow label first batch were not as good of a fit of the rim as the yellow label second batch. First batch also seemed off balance
[2022-05-03T22:44:13] Unknown: There definitely were changes made between batch 1 (no yellow logo) and current batches (with yellow logo)
[2022-05-03T23:37:31] rosheee: True dat

[2022-05-04T13:16:54] rosheee: g30 is more expensive here than the dick edition
[2022-05-04T13:17:04] Federico77: Because there are 2 more capacitors
[2022-05-04T13:17:39] Federico77: Even if you can only put one on that of the D series

[2022-05-04T13:45:02] D J: if I get a few climbs in a row it heats up quickly to 85°C 😅

[2022-05-04T14:30:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: cost ~7e on aliexpress. you need a STLink to program it

[2022-05-04T15:01:46] Happy Giraffe: You can try using thermal paste and bolting upside down to frame
[2022-05-04T15:02:27] Happy Giraffe: Did you have spintend single? Just to make sure
[2022-05-04T15:03:13] D J: I did exactly that
[2022-05-04T15:03:18] D J: Dual
[2022-05-04T15:03:33] Happy Giraffe: Oh, with dual it's different.
[2022-05-04T15:03:54] Happy Giraffe: What kind of settings are you using for power?
[2022-05-04T15:04:32] D J: 60 battery 130fase/170 abs
[2022-05-04T15:04:40] Happy Giraffe: Single needs to be bolted upside down due to spintend being silly
[2022-05-04T15:05:18] Happy Giraffe: That's not too crazy, others haven't reported cooling issues with dual tho
[2022-05-04T15:05:41] D J: but it only heats up a lot if it goes uphill
[2022-05-04T15:06:05] Happy Giraffe: Does temperature go down quickly after?
[2022-05-04T15:06:11] D J: Yes
[2022-05-04T15:07:22] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, then thermal pads might be ok. I haven't held that vesc in my hand so can't help more sorry

[2022-05-04T17:15:34] Mirono escooters: Wich is thiccer
[2022-05-04T17:17:03] Happy Giraffe: Isnt the axle 18x10mm flat side?

[2022-05-04T17:17:23] Mirono escooters: E-bike is 22mm or smth

[2022-05-04T17:19:06] Mirono escooters: Even Xiaomi has torque wahszrs for 250w :p
[2022-05-04T17:20:15] Happy Giraffe: If you want you can get 8mm on both sides, wont be needed I think but better off safe. You could also make hole drilled/lasercut and bolt it on to fork so if motor bolts come loose you dont die even then😂
[2022-05-04T17:20:26] Happy Giraffe: Sky is the limit
[2022-05-04T17:20:33] Mirono escooters: I need a cnc lol

[2022-05-05T13:21:12] Mirono escooters: Rather expensive for it
[2022-05-05T13:21:18] Mirono escooters: But if it works that's good
[2022-05-05T13:22:37] Mirko Boni: Yess! Perfect! Now finally at high speed the steering does not vibrate!
[2022-05-05T13:22:53] Mirono escooters: What is high speed?
[2022-05-05T13:23:14] Mirono escooters: I drive 50, and never experienced wobble. Did u richten thé vertical screw Good? When it's loose i experience wobble too
[2022-05-05T13:23:41] Mirko Boni: Previously at 55 km / h the steering vibrated! Now the scooter goes straight!
[2022-05-05T13:24:00] Mirono escooters: That's good

[2022-05-05T14:01:45] Happy Giraffe: If you have your left foot far in front be careful not to have it stuck there

[2022-05-05T22:00:13] Happy Giraffe: Oh shiet
[2022-05-05T22:09:27] D J: Why 😅?
[2022-05-05T22:12:49] Happy Giraffe: Haha, just a reaction for mod of this extreme. This should let quite a lot air in but I guess the hole area is quite low something 20% of the side
[2022-05-06T08:40:29] Gigolo Joe: Question for the SMORT ones: Dual vesc, does it matter to which one I'm connecting the throttle cable? To Front or rear motor
[2022-05-06T08:47:22] SirGeoff: It doesn't matter. Because the two vesc linked with the can bus, and exchange data.
[2022-05-06T08:48:59] SirGeoff: But you have to configure the two vescs, which is the data "sender" and which is the "receiver".
[2022-05-06T09:22:18] Gigolo Joe: Yeah that was my mistake Found it on Google
[2022-05-06T09:22:26] Gigolo Joe: Was configured wrond
[2022-05-06T09:25:04] Gigolo Joe: Didn't configure master to 0 and slave to 1
[2022-05-06T12:22:23] Gigolo Joe: Motors spins in air after leaving throttle only when field weakening is on Any ideas why?
[2022-05-06T12:22:44] Face de Pin Sucé: Normal
[2022-05-06T12:23:02] Gigolo Joe: 👌🏻
[2022-05-06T12:23:24] Face de Pin Sucé: Because it controls motor until normal speed, to prevent wheel lock
[2022-05-06T12:26:00] Gigolo Joe: I thought it might be a problem as my other scooter doesn't act like this, it just slowly drops speed

[2022-05-06T16:38:33] Luis Magalhaes: But norauto sells scooters approved to have number plate like a motorcycle 😂
[2022-05-06T16:38:41] rosheee: 20S7P with samsung 50E
[2022-05-06T16:38:58] rosheee: And have to fix charging port
[2022-05-06T16:39:37] rosheee: It is heavier than dualtron storm
[2022-05-06T16:50:28] Luis Magalhaes: Dual stem
[2022-05-06T16:50:37] Luis Magalhaes: Oil inside
[2022-05-06T16:50:48] Luis Magalhaes: Protection around it 😅
[2022-05-06T16:51:01] Luis Magalhaes: But its a nice chassis
[2022-05-06T16:51:03] Luis Magalhaes: I like it
[2022-05-06T16:53:02] rosheee: Shii
[2022-05-06T16:53:21] rosheee: I change to TFT with sinus controller
[2022-05-06T16:53:26] sombre_enfant: Dw my boi
[2022-05-06T16:53:26] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_4069@06-05-2022_16-53-26.jpg>
[2022-05-06T16:53:53] sombre_enfant: Look dope broo
[2022-05-06T16:53:59] rosheee: Dis as well
[2022-05-06T16:56:12] sombre_enfant: But this battery aint for me its for a client 20s5p mj1 bms daly 60A
[2022-05-06T17:02:39] Happy Giraffe: Thats more like it
[2022-05-06T17:02:51] Happy Giraffe: MJ "vdrop" 1
[2022-05-06T17:12:05] sombre_enfant: Nah your battery was trippin mine good
[2022-05-06T17:19:03] Happy Giraffe: Made by Albert🌚
[2022-05-06T17:19:08] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-05-06T17:22:53] Mirono escooters: Do wrap :)
[2022-05-06T17:23:28] rosheee: So friend does first ride
[2022-05-06T17:39:55] rosheee: Nyaaeee
[2022-05-06T17:40:08] rosheee: Minimotors throttle is worst
[2022-05-06T17:40:27] rosheee: And at 80kmh boost goes down not like with vesc where the party begins
[2022-05-06T17:45:48] rosheee: Luis initial torque 5 is least power, right?
[2022-05-06T17:45:56] rosheee: Cuz it is dangerous as fuck omg
[2022-05-06T17:46:03] rosheee: Even at 5
[2022-05-06T18:01:48] rosheee: I put vesc in
[2022-05-06T18:10:37] Luis Magalhaes: nice, so it was limited by software 😂
[2022-05-06T18:13:29] Luis Magalhaes: in mine is p9-3 for all torque and p7-0 for no slow start
[2022-05-06T18:14:34] Luis Magalhaes: its a square controller, no controll on start ride so all power and then with the speed the amps at battery drops lol
[2022-05-06T18:16:09] rosheee: Yep....worst
[2022-05-06T18:16:17] rosheee: Rly rly worst
[2022-05-06T18:16:28] rosheee: Maybr i put vesc in tonight
[2022-05-06T18:16:30] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-05-06T18:16:40] D J: 😍
[2022-05-06T18:16:51] Luis Magalhaes: It looks you dont know how to ride at low speed 😂
[2022-05-06T18:28:57] rosheee: Witz vesc no prib
[2022-05-06T18:29:03] rosheee: With that shit no
[2022-05-06T18:29:15] rosheee: G30 fucks thr kaaboo hard until 70
[2022-05-06T18:29:26] rosheee: Then kaabo overtakes
[2022-05-06T18:29:33] rosheee: So g30 still master of fuckeria
[2022-05-06T18:29:37] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-05-06T18:29:57] rosheee: But gonna add vesc
[2022-05-06T18:30:47] rosheee: But can handle the BMS that
[2022-05-06T18:30:49] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-05-06T18:30:58] rosheee: 2x60A
[2022-05-06T18:35:52] Luis Magalhaes: continuous i dont know
[2022-05-06T18:35:54] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2022-05-06T18:40:17] rosheee: Hmmm...controller 2x50A This is phase xD?
[2022-05-06T18:40:47] rosheee: If yes then holymaccaroni when go 2x100A phase lol
[2022-05-06T18:47:52] sombre_enfant: Battery
[2022-05-06T18:47:53] Luis Magalhaes: battery but peak
[2022-05-06T18:48:18] rosheee: So i can take 2x50A out of the 20S7P samsung 50e
[2022-05-06T18:48:44] sombre_enfant: Sure
[2022-05-06T18:48:49] Luis Magalhaes: 50E is rated to 9.8A
[2022-05-06T18:48:59] rosheee: Yah i just ask cuz bms
[2022-05-06T18:49:04] sombre_enfant: He got the method
[2022-05-06T18:49:05] rosheee: Not that i have same problem
[2022-05-06T18:49:21] Luis Magalhaes: should be able to get 50A
[2022-05-06T18:49:22] rosheee: Cuz i take 177a peak out of 5P 50G
[2022-05-06T18:49:23] Luis Magalhaes: x2
[2022-05-06T18:49:55] rosheee: Ok then i put in the vesc
[2022-05-06T18:49:59] Luis Magalhaes: <animation>
[2022-05-06T18:50:08] rosheee: Nooo...
[2022-05-06T18:50:15] rosheee: 13000km so far
[2022-05-06T18:50:31] rosheee: Everyday fuckeria and it can handle my domination penetration
[2022-05-06T18:50:46] rosheee: And the 60A bms as well
[2022-05-06T18:51:19] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣🤣
[2022-05-06T18:51:29] Luis Magalhaes: test it
[2022-05-06T18:51:39] rosheee: Because the super construction is so supernice
[2022-05-06T18:51:52] rosheee: Can i even use all the buttons for light with vesc?
[2022-05-06T18:53:16] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-05-06T18:56:46] rosheee: Scooter has 5km on it lol
[2022-05-06T18:59:48] Luis Magalhaes: dont know yours but mine the rear light is 60v
[2022-05-06T19:00:03] rosheee: XD whuat
[2022-05-06T19:00:20] Luis Magalhaes: should check if it lights with 12v
[2022-05-06T19:00:22] rosheee: Then my is 72V? Maybe
[2022-05-06T19:00:29] rosheee: Yah 🙈
[2022-05-06T19:00:31] Luis Magalhaes: maybe
[2022-05-06T19:24:30] rosheee: Battery deck open from top or do i havr to flip the scooter?
[2022-05-06T19:27:12] Luis Magalhaes: top
[2022-05-06T19:28:15] Luis Magalhaes: to remove the controllers you should have to remove 4 screws under the deck too
[2022-05-06T19:28:25] rosheee: Oooh
[2022-05-06T19:28:33] rosheee: <photos/photo_4070@06-05-2022_19-28-33.jpg>
[2022-05-06T19:28:53] rosheee: But can i connect it to the stock crap o.O?!
[2022-05-06T19:28:59] rosheee: So many questions
[2022-05-06T19:29:30] sombre_enfant: U want that throttle or keep the stock one for vesc ?
[2022-05-06T19:30:07] Luis Magalhaes: the eye display wont work on vesc
[2022-05-06T19:30:37] rosheee: I have that throttle
[2022-05-06T19:30:42] sombre_enfant: U can keep the hall for throttle signal
[2022-05-06T19:30:43] rosheee: I kick out the shit eye crap
[2022-05-06T19:31:03] rosheee: But omg i got nothing only throttle
[2022-05-06T19:31:09] rosheee: I sell it directly
[2022-05-06T19:31:20] rosheee: 2x 50A minimotors and eye3
[2022-05-06T19:31:33] Luis Magalhaes: but have to put direct
[2022-05-06T19:32:11] rosheee: Throttle To vesc Then solder hallsensor csble which i dont have
[2022-05-06T19:32:37] Luis Magalhaes: just remove that and put normal trotlle 🤣
[2022-05-06T19:33:06] Luis Magalhaes: those minimotors need the eye display to run
[2022-05-06T19:33:10] rosheee: I use thumb throttle i have on g30 and they use on pro model
[2022-05-06T19:33:18] rosheee: I kick out all minimotor crap
[2022-05-06T19:34:14] rosheee: Worst..rly cant understand ppl who love this
[2022-05-06T19:34:56] sombre_enfant: 108x is shit too
[2022-05-06T19:35:06] sombre_enfant: Nothing better than 270x
[2022-05-06T19:35:40] rosheee: 108x?
[2022-05-06T19:35:44] rosheee: 270x?
[2022-05-06T19:35:57] D J: @roscheeee your controllers are here inside
[2022-05-06T19:36:59] D J: like Luis said...just unscrew 4 screws. Easy
[2022-05-06T19:37:46] rosheee: Damn
[2022-05-06T19:37:52] rosheee: I know
[2022-05-06T19:37:55] rosheee: Opened alrdy
[2022-05-06T19:38:03] rosheee: But they fcked up the chsrhing port
[2022-05-06T19:38:10] Luis Magalhaes: i was forgeting that box too 🤣 the screws arent under the deck 😂
[2022-05-06T19:38:12] rosheee: The holding fall of inside
[2022-05-06T19:38:40] rosheee: U see
[2022-05-06T19:40:05] Luis Magalhaes: they are not direct to battery?
[2022-05-06T19:40:08] D J: Easy fix...and put some loctite. Charging ports are fucken danger ⚡
[2022-05-06T19:40:51] sombre_enfant: Dashboard is just magnificient
[2022-05-06T19:41:32] D J: 🤪
[2022-05-06T19:41:53] Unknown: I love Kart throttles. Trigger mostly. Right hand trigger for throttle and left hand trigger for e-brake. The thumb is sort of soft, too easy to push spring.
[2022-05-06T19:41:56] rosheee: Check the pic it is loose
[2022-05-06T19:42:16] rosheee: Supersexuelle
[2022-05-06T19:42:41] rosheee: Thid version has sinus controller and no minidick stuff
[2022-05-06T19:42:51] rosheee: But put vesc in and go max retard
[2022-05-06T19:42:58] sombre_enfant: 😰😰
[2022-05-06T19:43:16] sombre_enfant: Motor got les hall ?
[2022-05-06T19:43:26] rosheee: Oui
[2022-05-06T19:43:32] rosheee: Otherwise i didnt bought
[2022-05-06T19:43:38] sombre_enfant: Parfait vraiment sucé
[2022-05-06T19:43:53] rosheee: Here
[2022-05-06T19:44:20] rosheee: G30 feels so much better to ride ^^'
[2022-05-06T19:44:28] rosheee: And the brakes are shit as well
[2022-05-06T19:44:48] rosheee: Also gonna sell the fat discs and the brake kit
[2022-05-06T19:45:21] rosheee: So if someone want the brand new brakes and discs, controllers and ey3 throttle crap i give u best price
[2022-05-06T19:45:31] Unknown: Really would be great if these companies would start selling just the rolling chassis
[2022-05-06T19:45:37] rosheee: I asked..
[2022-05-06T19:45:43] rosheee: Many times xD
[2022-05-06T19:46:27] rosheee: My friend eho is official importer asked as well..but they smelled the chicken
[2022-05-06T19:46:50] rosheee: Original plan was buy vsett10+ frame and go retard But they denied selling just chassis
[2022-05-06T19:46:55] Unknown: Like, keep your shit controllers and dumb BMS battery and give me the frame so I can build it right... That's how I feel lol
[2022-05-06T19:46:58] Luis Magalhaes: oh ok just have to bolt in again lolol
[2022-05-06T19:47:13] rosheee: Exactemente
[2022-05-06T19:47:30] rosheee: Yes from inside where the holding is
[2022-05-06T19:47:46] Unknown: Ugh, yea... Basically what I did but bought the whole shit. Reselling all the electronics and battery I got about $850 back
[2022-05-06T19:48:04] Unknown: So not so bad when you look at it like that
[2022-05-06T19:48:09] rosheee: Word
[2022-05-06T19:48:27] rosheee: I sell my stuff very cheap xD damn
[2022-05-06T19:49:03] Unknown: Wait, actually more like $750 I think. Battery 500, controller 150, display 75 and few other miscellaneous items
[2022-05-06T19:49:12] rosheee: Brand new 0km G30 battery, esc, front wheel, motor, brake and ble for 300 euro
[2022-05-06T19:49:30] rosheee: XD
[2022-05-06T19:50:01] sombre_enfant: Fr
[2022-05-06T19:51:24] rosheee: So if someone want brake and stuff here the prices 2x 50A minimotors ESC with EY3 for 200euro 1 esc is 180euro so 360 euro new Ey3 is 50-80euro Kaabo brake front rear with fat 160mm discs and all cable crap for 100 euro
[2022-05-06T20:16:08] Face de Pin Sucé: You should keep disc
[2022-05-06T20:23:04] Unknown: You're too crazy man haha. Just unboxed the scooter like 4 hours ago and have all of the electronics up for sale already. Do you think ubox can push those monster motors to max capabilities without overheating or melting? Since you have way more room for controllers now, Maybe think of thing else that can handle those motors without pushing to max limit? Just a thought
[2022-05-06T20:24:39] Unknown: Seems like ubox might be limited by heat for those motors. I dunno, maybe not 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-05-06T20:25:48] Paolo ⁭: Very bad minimotors
[2022-05-06T20:25:52] Paolo ⁭: Square and no hall
[2022-05-06T20:26:05] Unknown: Knowing you you'll end up with a more capable battery at some point and then ubox will be bottleneck
[2022-05-06T20:26:14] Paolo ⁭: Minimotors isn’t like yyk
[2022-05-06T20:26:16] Paolo ⁭: Not efficient
[2022-05-06T20:28:10] Unknown: Using square vs foc sinewave.... Won't square be more punchy and more powerful on the lower end than FOC? Might take true sinewave controller more amps to achieve same power output? Square uses max phase amps to achieve given throttle position correct?
[2022-05-06T20:28:20] sombre_enfant: U dont understand the grind brev
[2022-05-06T20:28:32] Unknown: 😂😂 Oh.. I do
[2022-05-06T20:29:17] Кирилл: Ye, ubox can bring the shit out of these motors and totally destroy them, if you want. So limiting is needed to not to destroy the motors, not ubox😅
[2022-05-06T20:29:28] Unknown: Your talking to a guy with a Vsett 10 that uses bare frame and motors only from stock set-up lol
[2022-05-06T20:30:12] Unknown: Ubox can hurt these motors with too much current? Why doesn't that sound right to me
[2022-05-06T20:30:27] Кирилл: Ye, easy
[2022-05-06T20:30:49] Кирилл: But ubox is way more efficient than stock escs
[2022-05-06T20:31:17] Paolo ⁭: Minimotors is stranger square wave
[2022-05-06T20:31:20] Кирилл: Means more power and lower heat
[2022-05-06T20:31:24] Paolo ⁭: Yyk with same ampere can go much faster
[2022-05-06T20:31:34] Paolo ⁭: Idk why
[2022-05-06T20:31:45] Unknown: How? I run 75a battery and 200a phase on my 50mm magnet Vsett 10 motors, each. So ubox dual can run 150a battery and 400a phase? Or these motors aren't as strong as Vsett 10 motors?
[2022-05-06T20:32:25] Unknown: But motors are really only harmed by heat. Magnetic saturation from too many amps isn't "harmful"
[2022-05-06T20:32:48] Кирилл: I didnt say anything about saturation
[2022-05-06T20:33:08] Unknown: So.. heat?
[2022-05-06T20:33:10] Кирилл: But yes, it is harmful
[2022-05-06T20:33:49] Unknown: Heat is the limiting harmful factor for motors. Saturation only limits output... Doesn't harm
[2022-05-06T20:34:31] Unknown: Your best guess, what would be max battery and phase amps for the wolf gt motors?
[2022-05-06T20:34:48] Luis Magalhaes: true but he allready has the ubox i think
[2022-05-06T20:35:02] Кирилл: If you saturate motor by so many amps on low speed when efficient is low you can easily get heat very fast without the useful work of motor
[2022-05-06T20:35:12] rosheee: Idk
[2022-05-06T20:35:36] Unknown: But we're back to heat being harmful. Actual saturated motor isn't being harmed
[2022-05-06T20:35:37] Luis Magalhaes: that square controller is anoing if you dont want to push power lolol
[2022-05-06T20:35:40] rosheee: I pushed the g30 with 2x190a phase, 2x100a battery and 2x 200a max
[2022-05-06T20:36:02] rosheee: So the miniwiener controllers say 2x50A
[2022-05-06T20:36:04] Кирилл: Saturation and increased heat are together, you cant divide them
[2022-05-06T20:36:04] Luis Magalhaes: overheat is true
[2022-05-06T20:36:05] Unknown: Yes, very difficult to maintain low speeds smoothly.. and grossly inefficient
[2022-05-06T20:36:22] rosheee: XD so no problem pushing 2x100A with vesc i think
[2022-05-06T20:36:31] Unknown: You can overheat a motor before saturation though... So not always
[2022-05-06T20:36:41] Unknown: Battery?
[2022-05-06T20:36:44] Кирилл: Yes, you are right here
[2022-05-06T20:36:47] rosheee: 2X100a battery
[2022-05-06T20:37:02] rosheee: In g30 with 17S
[2022-05-06T20:37:14] rosheee: And vesc 0 cooling
[2022-05-06T20:37:25] Unknown: Hmm... And phase?
[2022-05-06T20:37:33] rosheee: Here
[2022-05-06T20:37:49] rosheee: Even 2x195A phase
[2022-05-06T20:38:03] rosheee: It run h0tt0 then xD
[2022-05-06T20:38:07] Luis Magalhaes: mine overheat if the deck was not open 🤣 and you have an example of Daniel overheating too
[2022-05-06T20:38:10] Unknown: Right.. my point exactly... "PUSHED"
[2022-05-06T20:38:28] Unknown: Was just saying a different controller can achieve that plus more without pushing to brink of explosion
[2022-05-06T20:38:29] rosheee: I set it
[2022-05-06T20:38:39] Luis Magalhaes: mine was normaly at 60Bat and 220Motor
[2022-05-06T20:38:47] rosheee: Ah i gonna push less on kaabo
[2022-05-06T20:38:52] Luis Magalhaes: 1200w motors kaabo
[2022-05-06T20:38:54] rosheee: Because idk the bms ^^'
[2022-05-06T20:38:54] Luis Magalhaes: 60v
[2022-05-06T20:38:58] Unknown: No you won't 😂😂

[2022-05-07T01:59:02] Paolo ⁭: Maybe you used different current before for detection
[2022-05-07T01:59:23] Nome: No, i set same current
[2022-05-07T02:01:35] Paolo ⁭: Flipsky is so bugged

[2022-05-07T03:15:39] Luis Magalhaes: the box is feed directly to the battery right?
[2022-05-07T03:15:47] rosheee: I think so
[2022-05-07T03:16:34] Luis Magalhaes: so you can keep the box and disconect from it what you need to conect to spintend or the adc adaptor
[2022-05-07T03:17:07] rosheee: Yah i need ever,thing
[2022-05-07T03:17:21] rosheee: Use the blinker and light shit
[2022-05-07T03:17:31] rosheee: Single and dual switch
[2022-05-07T03:17:45] rosheee: And wanna use with this
[2022-05-07T03:17:51] rosheee: <photos/photo_4107@07-05-2022_03-17-51.jpg>
[2022-05-07T03:21:21] rosheee: So for light i need stepdown..., right?
[2022-05-07T03:26:57] Luis Magalhaes: why ?
[2022-05-07T03:27:39] Luis Magalhaes: the box you have you can use it
[2022-05-07T03:27:57] Luis Magalhaes: use the original box for lights
[2022-05-07T03:28:19] rosheee: Ok pls xD help me
[2022-05-07T03:28:22] Luis Magalhaes: if you need ebrake then disconect them from that box and use on the adc adaptar
[2022-05-07T03:28:29] rosheee: No e brake
[2022-05-07T03:28:34] rosheee: Just the light button
[2022-05-07T03:28:41] rosheee: Not even dual single motor switch
[2022-05-07T03:28:51] Luis Magalhaes: the light use what you have there
[2022-05-07T03:29:05] Luis Magalhaes: same light switch use it as it is conected
[2022-05-07T03:29:22] rosheee: So everything connected to this?
[2022-05-07T03:29:28] rosheee: This
[2022-05-07T03:29:37] Luis Magalhaes: if it is not conected to the controller then it should work even if you remove controller
[2022-05-07T03:29:48] Luis Magalhaes: yes
[2022-05-07T03:29:52] rosheee: Hmm
[2022-05-07T03:30:04] rosheee: I had to turn the crap on that it worked
[2022-05-07T03:30:12] Luis Magalhaes: the button for lights is conected to that and the lights too
[2022-05-07T03:31:18] rosheee: But it wont turn on
[2022-05-07T03:31:45] Luis Magalhaes: ok so maybe it use some signal from controller to say its on
[2022-05-07T03:32:17] Luis Magalhaes: the number 1 says display is maybe comes from there
[2022-05-07T03:32:44] Luis Magalhaes: mine dont have that , the controller was feeding the lights
[2022-05-07T03:32:57] rosheee: <photos/photo_4108@07-05-2022_03-32-57.jpg>
[2022-05-07T03:33:30] Luis Magalhaes: so i had to conect 1 cable from batery to switch and then to the lights (rear and front) and the other cable direct to battery
[2022-05-07T03:33:55] Luis Magalhaes: but if i stop i have to turn off the lights, they dont turn off with controller
[2022-05-07T03:35:01] Luis Magalhaes: so all cables come to that before controller 😅
[2022-05-07T03:35:09] rosheee: So
[2022-05-07T03:35:17] Luis Magalhaes: only motors come direct
[2022-05-07T03:35:34] Luis Magalhaes: 5. power switch
[2022-05-07T03:35:40] rosheee: Yes
[2022-05-07T03:35:41] Luis Magalhaes: the power should come from there
[2022-05-07T03:36:09] rosheee: This o.O
[2022-05-07T03:36:15] rosheee: <photos/photo_4109@07-05-2022_03-36-15.jpg>
[2022-05-07T03:36:30] Luis Magalhaes: that is nº 5?
[2022-05-07T03:36:38] rosheee: Yes
[2022-05-07T03:36:44] rosheee: Connected to a controller
[2022-05-07T03:36:51] Luis Magalhaes: so it should be 72v + i think
[2022-05-07T03:37:05] Luis Magalhaes: should need a negative too
[2022-05-07T03:37:12] rosheee: Hmm there is no
[2022-05-07T03:37:28] rosheee: It was a jumper there btw
[2022-05-07T03:37:30] Luis Magalhaes: that one should be where it acts as a switch
[2022-05-07T03:37:32] rosheee: Where power is
[2022-05-07T03:37:51] rosheee: See jumper?
[2022-05-07T03:38:27] Luis Magalhaes: yes
[2022-05-07T03:38:55] Luis Magalhaes: but that is conected to that jumper ?
[2022-05-07T03:39:04] rosheee: No to controller
[2022-05-07T03:40:21] Luis Magalhaes: this one was conected to the port with the jumper ?
[2022-05-07T03:40:28] rosheee: No
[2022-05-07T03:40:33] rosheee: Jumper was always inside
[2022-05-07T03:40:53] rosheee: To controller
[2022-05-07T03:41:37] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2022-05-07T03:42:08] rosheee: Yes aiaiia
[2022-05-07T03:42:22] Luis Magalhaes: so that cable is conected to controller and goes somewere not the box ?
[2022-05-07T03:42:58] rosheee: <photos/photo_4111@07-05-2022_03-42-58.jpg>
[2022-05-07T03:43:40] Luis Magalhaes: ok
[2022-05-07T03:44:26] Luis Magalhaes: the power switch then should be just to conect some type of switch and because it does not have one they bypass it with that jumper
[2022-05-07T03:44:37] Luis Magalhaes: so its not from there the power comes
[2022-05-07T03:45:06] Luis Magalhaes: the display has a cable direct from battery power too
[2022-05-07T03:45:18] Luis Magalhaes: maybe it was feed by the display port
[2022-05-07T03:46:31] rosheee: Hmmm
[2022-05-07T03:47:04] Luis Magalhaes: only way i can see it being powered
[2022-05-07T03:48:02] Luis Magalhaes: if you want to use that you have to find a way to power it on
[2022-05-07T03:48:25] Luis Magalhaes: or you can do like mine
[2022-05-07T03:48:53] Luis Magalhaes: power direct to light switch and then conect to lights
[2022-05-07T03:49:11] rosheee: So 5 has to be power
[2022-05-07T03:49:36] Luis Magalhaes: 5 should be to use as a switch to power on the lights
[2022-05-07T03:49:44] rosheee: Ok
[2022-05-07T03:49:45] Luis Magalhaes: you test it with the jumper on?
[2022-05-07T03:49:55] rosheee: I kicked out jumper
[2022-05-07T03:50:13] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2022-05-07T03:50:25] Luis Magalhaes: test it again with jumper
[2022-05-07T03:50:45] Luis Magalhaes: maybe you already have the power but without jumper in wont turn on
[2022-05-07T03:51:28] rosheee: Ahhh
[2022-05-07T03:51:37] rosheee: Jumper in
[2022-05-07T03:51:39] rosheee: Wont turn on
[2022-05-07T03:51:52] rosheee: But the wire that comes from display There is also powerbutton
[2022-05-07T03:51:53] Luis Magalhaes: ok so not the jumper
[2022-05-07T03:52:17] Luis Magalhaes: yes and that has B+ too
[2022-05-07T03:53:45] rosheee: Maybe
[2022-05-07T03:53:48] rosheee: Brcause here
[2022-05-07T03:54:13] rosheee: <photos/photo_4112@07-05-2022_03-54-13.jpg>
[2022-05-07T03:54:15] rosheee: Is this
[2022-05-07T03:54:38] rosheee: <photos/photo_4113@07-05-2022_03-54-38.jpg>
[2022-05-07T03:55:47] Luis Magalhaes: ok so maybe that cable goes directly to the switch
[2022-05-07T03:56:08] rosheee: Yes but the switch is on display
[2022-05-07T03:56:18] rosheee: If i hsve no display there is no switch xD
[2022-05-07T03:56:29] Luis Magalhaes: no the light switch
[2022-05-07T03:56:46] rosheee: Aha
[2022-05-07T03:56:51] Luis Magalhaes: but it has to be pluged to the display too
[2022-05-07T03:57:08] Luis Magalhaes: when you turn off the display lights go off to
[2022-05-07T03:57:20] Luis Magalhaes: forget
[2022-05-07T03:57:31] rosheee: Yes
[2022-05-07T03:57:38] Luis Magalhaes: when the displays goes off that cable from controller go off too
[2022-05-07T03:57:42] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2022-05-07T03:57:53] rosheee: Yes because this
[2022-05-07T03:57:55] rosheee: The orange
[2022-05-07T03:59:44] Luis Magalhaes: you could check with multimeter
[2022-05-07T03:59:55] rosheee: Yes
[2022-05-07T03:59:59] rosheee: XD got none here
[2022-05-07T04:00:08] Luis Magalhaes: the orange cable and the switch
[2022-05-07T04:00:19] rosheee: Then do what?
[2022-05-07T04:00:24] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2022-05-07T04:00:26] rosheee: How does switch looks?
[2022-05-07T04:00:30] rosheee: I go and get 1 now
[2022-05-07T04:00:33] rosheee: 10min back
[2022-05-07T04:00:58] Luis Magalhaes: the light switch you have on handlebar
[2022-05-07T04:01:45] Luis Magalhaes: if it power's the lights from there conecting one probe to the orange and checking the light switch output it should bip
[2022-05-07T04:02:35] rosheee: But here it says orange cable
[2022-05-07T04:02:42] rosheee: And brown
[2022-05-07T04:02:58] rosheee: <photos/photo_4114@07-05-2022_04-02-58.jpg>
[2022-05-07T04:04:24] Luis Magalhaes: maybe its positive and negative
[2022-05-07T04:04:29] Luis Magalhaes: 😅
[2022-05-07T04:05:12] Luis Magalhaes: its a bit stupid to use a conection box and conect cables directly any way
[2022-05-07T04:05:15] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2022-05-07T04:05:52] Luis Magalhaes: you should get a multimeter to see voltage of that cables and try to understand it
[2022-05-07T04:06:52] Luis Magalhaes: but that nº2 conector is the light switch, it has to be conected direct
[2022-05-07T04:07:16] Luis Magalhaes: those 2 cables the brown and the orange should be the power
[2022-05-07T04:07:34] Luis Magalhaes: orange should be batery voltage coming from the controller
[2022-05-07T04:07:51] Luis Magalhaes: try cheking from where comes the brown one
[2022-05-07T04:11:40] rosheee: Ol
[2022-05-07T04:11:41] rosheee: Ok
[2022-05-07T04:11:49] rosheee: 2min then i get multimeter
[2022-05-07T04:12:21] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣
[2022-05-07T04:12:53] Luis Magalhaes: if i dont respond its because im sleeping 😂
[2022-05-07T06:03:38] rosheee: Controller delivers power
[2022-05-07T06:06:30] rosheee: So just have to connect battery to the board, right? Get +/- ..
[2022-05-07T06:34:54] rosheee: Yes
[2022-05-07T06:35:25] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-05-07T06:37:27] rosheee: So the minidick esc delivers 78V or more to the hub board Then hub board split it into 12V and 84V So i can send directly 84V +/- to the hub board, right?
[2022-05-07T08:27:26] rosheee: Ooooh bratan

[2022-05-07T13:41:40] rosheee: Brand new
[2022-05-07T13:44:37] Unknown: Anyone know how to calibrate the battery voltage reading? On the new 75100 boards they read about 2V less than the actual battery voltage
[2022-05-07T13:50:30] sombre_enfant: We ordered one on volt our retailer but idk if they will sent the right one i took for dualtron spider but on all their picture for adapter its the one with 3 hole

[2022-05-07T14:31:14] Unknown: PM to IS (post mount bracket) with F180/R160 size, F180 and R160 are 2 ways of saying the exact thing. Some companies label them as F180 and as R160. Magura is QM12, all the same adapters just named differently
[2022-05-07T14:31:38] Unknown: Basically F180 is identical to R160 So confusing
[2022-05-07T14:32:28] Unknown: Not saying that's the one you need @lBabacar Just saying watch out for the labeling because it can be tricky
[2022-05-07T14:33:52] sombre_enfant: I guess @roscheeee one are F160 R140
[2022-05-07T14:35:06] Unknown: Yup, "F" front is generally 20mm larger than "R" rear... 160/140, 160/180, 180,200 etc...
[2022-05-07T14:35:20] sombre_enfant: Need to search may i got one or maybe my brake will come with

[2022-05-07T21:10:31] Happy Giraffe: And that is when?😂
[2022-05-07T21:11:19] Happy Giraffe: I like XT150 because of the plastic housing and its 6mm so theoretically bit better
[2022-05-07T21:11:42] Happy Giraffe: 5.5 also enough but hey less resistance😂
[2022-05-07T21:12:14] sombre_enfant: Idk ask the main character

[2022-05-07T21:16:26] Happy Giraffe: Yep, mostly for the convenient plastic housing
[2022-05-07T21:18:45] rosheee: Facking csbles
[2022-05-07T21:18:52] rosheee: EVERYTIME CABLES

[2022-05-07T21:39:17] Luis Magalhaes: <animation>
[2022-05-07T21:58:29] Gigolo Joe: Anyone using those controllers?
[2022-05-07T21:59:19] Unknown: I know someone who uses them in an electric skateboard. I haven't gotten any feedback but I know he had them running really good
[2022-05-07T22:00:07] Gigolo Joe: Really want to order one for my scooter Looking for some long term opinions
[2022-05-07T22:00:13] Кирилл: Yes, Rion using this in Apex model, and Tronic 450 is in Thrust model
[2022-05-07T22:01:03] Кирилл: Rion Noir maybe will use Tronic 750
[2022-05-07T22:01:25] Gigolo Joe: I want to hear some actual experience and not 'on the paper' Rion also claims thier scooter goes 160 km/h and not a single proof
[2022-05-07T22:01:26] Unknown: I think that would be a great quality option for VESC. Are they available?? I wonder why we don't hear more about the tronic controllers
[2022-05-07T22:01:49] Gigolo Joe: Website says they ready to ship once u pay
[2022-05-07T22:01:53] Кирилл: They claimed 80mph (limited). But anyway, 150 km/h is easy with their motors, battery and mass to power ratio
[2022-05-07T22:02:00] Unknown: I can ask... I know he has them installed in a beastttt esk8
[2022-05-07T22:02:54] Unknown: Hmm...
[2022-05-07T22:03:28] Unknown: Oh yea... Available
[2022-05-07T22:04:14] Unknown: 100a batt and 250a phase. 88v or 21s max. Similar to Nuc 12F but 50 less batt amps
[2022-05-07T22:04:51] Gigolo Joe: Пиздёж это всё, пока не выложат видос с трудом верится что поедет больше
[2022-05-07T22:04:54] Unknown: 400 bucks tho... Dual controllers are 800 😲 Maybe that's why we don't hear more about them lok
[2022-05-07T22:05:45] Gigolo Joe: Not that expensive, if they can stand up to nuc12
[2022-05-07T22:06:13] Кирилл: lol, ok, you dont know anything about mass to power ratios
[2022-05-07T22:06:54] Gigolo Joe: U right I have no clue Teach me, master
[2022-05-07T22:07:01] Gigolo Joe: <sticker>
[2022-05-07T22:07:18] Кирилл: you are welcome🤝
[2022-05-07T22:07:26] Unknown: Dual tronic250 and koxx smartdisplay will set you back around 1100-1200. Similar dual 12F and display setup is around 800.. but not available currently so that doesn't mean much lol. I would pay 800 bucks for 2 excellent VESC's

[2022-05-08T22:08:07] Paolo ⁭: Because the center of gravity is very high
[2022-05-08T22:08:20] Paolo ⁭: Rion design is just cool

[2022-05-08T23:28:11] Happy Giraffe: I wonder what carbon they used and what pattern on it, T1000 is so damn stiff
[2022-05-08T23:29:14] Happy Giraffe: If the rétards made parallel patterns with lower quality ofcourse it will bounce like a kangaroo on redbull

[2022-05-09T01:07:07] rosheee: idk
[2022-05-09T01:07:11] rosheee: i had no chance to test
[2022-05-09T01:07:11] rosheee: XD
[2022-05-09T01:07:20] Happy Giraffe: But then it's slower kv so not that many amps needed for torque
[2022-05-09T01:07:23] rosheee: when i fucked up vesc i uploaded fw5.2
[2022-05-09T01:07:37] rosheee: kaabo have superhigh kv lol

[2022-05-09T01:14:29] rosheee: happy mothers day
[2022-05-09T01:15:52] Paolo ⁭: I’ve limited 70A battery
[2022-05-09T01:16:15] Paolo ⁭: But xd my wire are 10mm and connector 8mm and was hot too
[2022-05-09T01:16:22] Happy Giraffe: KLS 7230?
[2022-05-09T01:16:30] Paolo ⁭: 7218
[2022-05-09T01:17:09] rosheee: lol
[2022-05-09T01:17:10] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, hard to say. Weird stuff going on
[2022-05-09T01:17:12] rosheee: fuck qs8 connector
[2022-05-09T01:17:13] rosheee: XD
[2022-05-09T01:17:23] rosheee: qs8 only cont. 120A
[2022-05-09T01:17:40] rosheee: my phase hxt6 can do more
[2022-05-09T01:17:47] rosheee: and cost less i gonna use HXT8MM for power
[2022-05-09T01:18:41] Happy Giraffe: I think something fucked up, maybe he should try with 50A battery
[2022-05-09T01:18:50] rosheee: <photos/photo_4175@09-05-2022_01-18-50.jpg>
[2022-05-09T01:18:54] rosheee: word
[2022-05-09T01:19:58] Happy Giraffe: Phase current =/= DC battery current
[2022-05-09T01:20:20] rosheee: but for battery it is cheaper and smaller than QS8 and can put more A through
[2022-05-09T01:20:20] Happy Giraffe: But XT90 in reality 90A peak 45 continuous
[2022-05-09T01:20:28] rosheee: yes 😆that's also problematic
[2022-05-09T01:21:06] Happy Giraffe: QS8 should handle 70A continuous tho
[2022-05-09T01:21:49] rosheee: lol
[2022-05-09T01:21:53] rosheee: QS8 is so fucking huge
[2022-05-09T01:22:01] rosheee: it should handle same as HXT8MM
[2022-05-09T01:22:06] rosheee: because it is same size
[2022-05-09T01:22:33] rosheee: in CH 1x QS8 = same price like 10 pair of HXT 8mm
[2022-05-09T01:27:39] Paolo ⁭: Ch = China
[2022-05-09T01:40:54] Luis Magalhaes: 70% battery ?
[2022-05-09T02:08:08] Paolo ⁭: Current limit
[2022-05-09T02:09:20] Luis Magalhaes: how much percentage you use there?
[2022-05-09T02:09:30] Paolo ⁭: 100 xd
[2022-05-09T02:09:48] Paolo ⁭: Why I should limit it
[2022-05-09T02:10:26] Luis Magalhaes: so your not using 70Amp 🤣
[2022-05-09T02:10:44] Paolo ⁭: Battery limit then no 70A?
[2022-05-09T02:10:51] Paolo ⁭: Current limit
[2022-05-09T02:11:06] Luis Magalhaes: if you have 100% it will pass the 70A
[2022-05-09T02:11:16] Luis Magalhaes: for a some time for sure
[2022-05-09T02:11:51] Paolo ⁭: Gg but too much heat lol
[2022-05-09T02:12:04] Luis Magalhaes: but should not get hot 😅
[2022-05-09T02:12:05] Paolo ⁭: You’ve 70C in just 10 seconds of acceleration
[2022-05-09T02:12:19] Luis Magalhaes: too much
[2022-05-09T02:12:20] Paolo ⁭: And why you pass 20kmh do the strange sound
[2022-05-09T02:12:22] Luis Magalhaes: not normal
[2022-05-09T02:12:33] Paolo ⁭: Yes but I still not find the fault
[2022-05-09T02:12:40] Luis Magalhaes: the 2 controllers do the same ?
[2022-05-09T02:12:44] Paolo ⁭: I will try with front motor, maybe failed controller
[2022-05-09T02:12:52] Paolo ⁭: Not tried yet the second
[2022-05-09T02:12:58] Luis Magalhaes: oh ok
[2022-05-09T02:13:07] Luis Magalhaes: should try the other then
[2022-05-09T02:13:15] Luis Magalhaes: could be some problem there
[2022-05-09T02:26:38] rosheee: i set battery current max to 60 so 2x60=120A but XD goes peak 150-155A
[2022-05-09T02:29:06] rosheee: the cells are rly crap in the kaabo xD
[2022-05-09T02:29:08] rosheee: holyshit

[2022-05-09T02:38:35] rosheee: yes
[2022-05-09T02:39:29] Luis Magalhaes: mine deviate for 4A

[2022-05-09T02:44:52] rosheee: wtf
[2022-05-09T03:00:52] rosheee: lol @ samsung50s
[2022-05-09T03:00:53] rosheee: Samsung lists the max continuous discharge rating at 25A. This rating has an 80°C temperature limit but the cells I tested get close to 90°C at 25A down to 2.5V so I am rating them at 20A continuous. I do not know why these cells ran hotter as Samsung does not exaggerate their ratings.
[2022-05-09T03:02:09] Paolo ⁭: You get a Chinese 50S Xd
[2022-05-09T03:02:14] rosheee: no

[2022-05-11T00:50:26] rosheee: We will see
[2022-05-11T00:50:41] Happy Giraffe: If put into too much torsion it will crack slowly

[2022-05-11T00:58:55] rosheee: Possey will be on fire
[2022-05-11T00:59:28] Paolo ⁭: Problem isn’t cooling or ubox case
[2022-05-11T00:59:48] Paolo ⁭: Problem is heat transfer from mosfet die to aluminium lol
[2022-05-11T01:01:16] rosheee: Copper will be
[2022-05-11T01:01:40] rosheee: And why is it bad?
[2022-05-11T01:03:25] Paolo ⁭: Because resin only little heat transfer
[2022-05-11T01:03:59] Paolo ⁭: All heat are transferred to pcb copper , that is thick only 0.1mm
[2022-05-11T01:04:35] Paolo ⁭: Little focer or TRONIC you have directly contact with mosfet metal
[2022-05-11T01:04:44] Paolo ⁭: Then much better dissipation
[2022-05-11T01:05:40] rosheee: Where is pcb cooper?
[2022-05-11T01:06:04] Paolo ⁭: Under pcb mask xd
[2022-05-11T01:06:33] Paolo ⁭: But is very little copper, that mosfet no way to cool it
[2022-05-11T01:06:46] rosheee: Omg
[2022-05-11T01:06:59] rosheee: So no chance for better coolingM
[2022-05-11T01:07:16] Paolo ⁭: You can help yes with your project
[2022-05-11T01:07:20] Paolo ⁭: But not affect much
[2022-05-11T01:08:42] rosheee: Hmm
[2022-05-11T01:08:54] rosheee: Damn
[2022-05-11T01:10:20] Paolo ⁭: Then minimotors
[2022-05-11T01:10:44] rosheee: My not engineer iq10 idea is Cut out the area where most heat is generated @ubox Put in copper there Use true mofo thin pads Use heatpipe and then whole bottomspacer as c00ler
[2022-05-11T01:11:53] rosheee: Summer maybe try additional airflow
[2022-05-11T01:13:07] rosheee: And btw Customwheel.shop guys dead?
[2022-05-11T01:46:08] Happy Giraffe: Finally

[2022-05-11T01:50:24] rosheee: Nope
[2022-05-11T01:50:27] Paolo ⁭: Not because better cooling
[2022-05-11T01:50:28] Paolo ⁭: Yea
[2022-05-11T01:50:35] rosheee: Then shouod burn
[2022-05-11T01:50:36] Paolo ⁭: Touch with your hand mosfet
[2022-05-11T01:50:41] rosheee: Done
[2022-05-11T01:50:47] Paolo ⁭: No
[2022-05-11T01:50:51] rosheee: Tested with laser
[2022-05-11T01:51:04] Paolo ⁭: Mosfet can 150C no problem
[2022-05-11T01:51:16] Paolo ⁭: Laser useless for that
[2022-05-11T01:51:38] Paolo ⁭: You need professional infrared camera 600€
[2022-05-11T01:51:46] Paolo ⁭: That shit 20€ laser is useless
[2022-05-11T02:12:27] Happy Giraffe: Also cant point thermo or laser at heatsink

[2022-05-12T13:32:14] Paolo ⁭: Because her seems already working fine, our still in development
[2022-05-12T13:33:51] Face de Pin Sucé: How is it going ? I remember you posted some videos working
[2022-05-12T13:36:13] Paolo ⁭: Yes but was fixed with glue and some “flying wire”
[2022-05-12T13:36:21] Paolo ⁭: Need new pcb
[2022-05-12T13:37:15] Face de Pin Sucé: I see

[2022-05-12T13:38:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2022-05-12T13:41:52] Happy Giraffe: Is your vesc single or dual?
[2022-05-12T13:42:14] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Dual
[2022-05-12T13:57:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Wow a super crap from 2006
[2022-05-12T14:26:08] Paolo ⁭: I forgot design, was 12 mos per motor ?
[2022-05-12T14:27:43] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes, 12*300A mosfet per motor 600A per phase (absolut)
[2022-05-12T14:31:26] Paolo ⁭: 100v ?
[2022-05-12T14:31:36] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes
[2022-05-12T14:31:51] Paolo ⁭: Same as ubox v2 I think
[2022-05-12T14:33:28] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Ubox 100v yes, but more power, more efficient
[2022-05-12T14:34:22] Face de Pin Sucé: More fun
[2022-05-12T14:35:54] Paolo ⁭: I think good for 250A battery maybe
[2022-05-12T14:36:06] Paolo ⁭: Need super thick pcb
[2022-05-12T14:36:07] Face de Pin Sucé: Let's hope
[2022-05-12T14:36:19] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 300A battery, I hope 😆
[2022-05-12T14:36:35] Paolo ⁭: Depends by cooling
[2022-05-12T14:36:40] Mirono escooters: Wich awg cable that needs. Lol
[2022-05-12T14:36:55] Paolo ⁭: 7

[2022-05-12T14:37:38] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Depend by cooling but especially depend how long, we will see =)
[2022-05-12T14:39:30] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but i hope 400A phase 300A Battery at 60% of duty cycle
[2022-05-12T14:40:20] Face de Pin Sucé: And we both now I'll push to 500A
[2022-05-12T14:40:30] Face de Pin Sucé: Then I'll burn it and you'll kill me
[2022-05-12T14:42:12] Mirono escooters: Bromance
[2022-05-12T14:43:22] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Yeah, he kill everything 😆
[2022-05-12T14:44:51] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yeah, 8/7/6 depend the target how long you want this current
[2022-05-12T14:45:31] Happy Giraffe: Shiiiit
[2022-05-12T14:46:07] Happy Giraffe: Will it be much larger than dual Ubox then? I could perhaps use as single esc
[2022-05-12T14:46:49] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 110*110 mm for a dual, not too big
[2022-05-12T14:46:53] Paolo ⁭: Total in 24 mos or 12? 😐
[2022-05-12T14:46:56] Happy Giraffe: Smol
[2022-05-12T14:47:27] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Total 24 for dual, 12 per motor
[2022-05-12T14:47:58] Paolo ⁭: Oh then it’s ok, 400A batteria in two mos you kill them ahahah
[2022-05-12T14:48:13] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Total phase 800A and 600A Battery for a Dual, if god want, and battery can 😆
[2022-05-12T14:48:22] Paolo ⁭: 6oz pcb you need lol
[2022-05-12T14:49:51] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Bus bar, Copper is your friend !
[2022-05-12T14:52:02] Mirono escooters: You guys need silver at this point
[2022-05-12T14:52:43] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: if it work well, gold 😆
[2022-05-12T14:54:08] Paolo ⁭: What price are you looking to sell?
[2022-05-12T14:55:41] Face de Pin Sucé: Expansive 😂😂
[2022-05-12T14:55:59] Mirono escooters: Copper is more conductive then gold :))
[2022-05-12T14:56:09] Mirono escooters: Silver is best. Go silver😃
[2022-05-12T14:56:38] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: we are far to something to sell, it's project to us for the moment, but the design will have to be modified enormously to be producible and of course the cost will be high
[2022-05-12T14:57:45] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: except if i produce by my hand, and in this case the price would be higher again
[2022-05-12T14:58:54] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: a bit expansive 😆 Silver bar amazing
[2022-05-12T15:00:17] Face de Pin Sucé: 🤤
[2022-05-12T15:00:27] Face de Pin Sucé: You know my love to bus bars
[2022-05-12T15:01:00] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: you want to show us the bus bar i do for you ? xD
[2022-05-12T15:03:39] D J: no doubt whoever develops a good controller based on Vesc with good performance and good heat dissipation will have a good product to sell and create good business 👌 and I will surely be one of those people interested in buying this controller 🔥
[2022-05-12T15:06:16] Paolo ⁭: 500?600?
[2022-05-12T15:08:18] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: there are for 200 € just for mosfet, so the final price will be either, probably upper 1000 sadly we are not Chinese, we can't produce or buy component for near to 0 like them
[2022-05-12T15:08:47] sombre_enfant: 1 thowow
[2022-05-12T15:11:15] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: we try to make a high-performance ESC, before making an "economical" one
[2022-05-12T15:12:41] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: you know the STM32 used for VESC Cost more than 30€ currently, need two for a dual = 60€ , since Covid all the price explode
[2022-05-12T15:13:23] Paolo ⁭: I mean for board :)
[2022-05-12T15:13:32] Paolo ⁭: Then 500x2 = 1000
[2022-05-12T15:13:59] Paolo ⁭: Wtf I paid 40$ for one stm
[2022-05-12T15:14:25] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes, it's that 40$ around 30€
[2022-05-12T15:14:39] Paolo ⁭: Now 1$ = 0.97€😢😢😢😢
[2022-05-12T15:14:58] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: woow, shit 😆
[2022-05-12T15:15:10] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: maybe it's more expansive than last time i saw
[2022-05-12T15:15:13] Paolo ⁭: Yes make me very difficult to made one
[2022-05-12T15:16:03] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Yeah, Also the Mos driver it's the same, Amplifier too, regulator too, voltage reference too etc etc ...
[2022-05-12T15:16:29] Paolo ⁭: My model is made with cheap components and production cost is high anyway
[2022-05-12T15:17:28] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes, but i can't in my project, i need high quality driver, high quality amplifier, etc ... Damn
[2022-05-12T15:18:14] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: you know even Spinted change component, they change good 4A mos driver from Infineon to Chinese shit 1.5A
[2022-05-12T15:18:38] Happy Giraffe: Is it a different model or silent component swap?
[2022-05-12T15:19:07] Happy Giraffe: I thought this is usually done on PC PSUs
[2022-05-12T15:19:19] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: what ?
[2022-05-12T15:19:29] Paolo ⁭: Yes, depends even by your target
[2022-05-12T15:19:41] Happy Giraffe: Did they change it on the same exact model of ubox?
[2022-05-12T15:20:27] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: no, Since V2
[2022-05-12T15:22:15] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: V2 is more économical, they remove the BLE bord, downgrade mos driver etc
[2022-05-12T15:22:22] Happy Giraffe: Thats interesting, they are planning new single ubox now but I dont know about details
[2022-05-12T15:22:46] Happy Giraffe: 100v single with better cooling
[2022-05-12T15:23:54] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: why ? cooling are the same on all spint, and it's not efficient
[2022-05-12T15:24:15] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's not making for high power Spinted
[2022-05-12T15:25:10] Paolo ⁭: +1
[2022-05-12T15:25:14] Happy Giraffe: Ubox single cooling is bit bad, mosfet located on wrong side of case if bolted to frame with paste. Also case splits in half so thermal mass 1/2
[2022-05-12T15:25:32] Paolo ⁭: Ubox single is made for one wheel
[2022-05-12T15:26:08] Happy Giraffe: Yeah🌚 they tell about them fucking balance wheels. Shut up and give us power!
[2022-05-12T15:26:10] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: for one wheel not high power 😆
[2022-05-12T15:26:40] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-05-12T15:27:18] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: one wheel at 100A peak around 30 constant it's joke
[2022-05-12T15:27:44] Paolo ⁭: One wheel flipsky enough
[2022-05-12T15:27:51] Paolo ⁭: Add imu and done
[2022-05-12T15:28:47] Happy Giraffe: Lol
[2022-05-12T15:39:12] Mirono escooters: How this looks?
[2022-05-12T15:41:37] Happy Giraffe: Maybe bit burned off flux but ok
[2022-05-12T15:43:10] Mirono escooters: Yea flux are details
[2022-05-12T15:47:40] Happy Giraffe: If you burn all flux away it introduces some issues as it protects the joint but should be ok in this case
[2022-05-12T15:49:15] Mirono escooters: How does it protect?
[2022-05-12T15:51:19] Happy Giraffe: Flux is a chemical cleaning agent used before and during the soldering process of electronic components onto circuit boards. Flux is used in both manual hand soldering as well as the different automated processes used by PCB contract manufacturers. The main purpose of the flux is to prepare the metal surfaces for soldering by cleaning and removing any oxides and impurities. Oxides are formed when metal is exposed to air and may prevent the formation of good solder joints. The flux also protects the metal surfaces from re-oxidation during soldering and helps the soldering process by altering the surface tension of the molten solder.
[2022-05-12T15:51:49] Happy Giraffe: Basically keeps surfaces clean from oxide and shit
[2022-05-12T15:53:02] Mirono escooters: Sick

[2022-05-12T21:13:34] Happy Giraffe: Just check the rear dropout, you need a torque arm there

[2022-05-12T21:17:07] Mirono escooters: Has temp sebsor im good
[2022-05-12T21:17:14] Mirono escooters: Lets mayve start without heatsink..
[2022-05-12T21:17:51] Happy Giraffe: Yeah dont use that giant block of metal, even a thin and small alu box will give you nice cooling if you manage to bolt it into it
[2022-05-12T21:18:08] Happy Giraffe: If it's under the frame it catches direct air
[2022-05-12T21:18:32] Happy Giraffe: And basically everywhere else aswell

[2022-05-12T21:23:22] Happy Giraffe: Finding right size and shape bit harder tho
[2022-05-12T21:23:40] Mirono escooters: 3d print go brr
[2022-05-12T21:24:33] Happy Giraffe: I doubt you need a heatsink
[2022-05-12T21:29:52] Face de Pin Sucé: Didn't use it enough time with this power to break it 😂
[2022-05-12T21:30:12] Mirono escooters: Problably not
[2022-05-12T21:30:22] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂 i would be scared of breaking

[2022-05-12T21:30:39] Face de Pin Sucé: But it was fucking powerful
[2022-05-12T21:30:57] Face de Pin Sucé: Single motor better acceleration than shunted dual Thunder 😂
[2022-05-12T21:31:01] Face de Pin Sucé: And better top speed also
[2022-05-12T21:31:17] Face de Pin Sucé: When activating dual motor, was impossible to control at startup 😂

[2022-05-12T21:33:00] Face de Pin Sucé: I never performed a top speed, was too scared with this frame
[2022-05-12T21:33:50] Happy Giraffe: Have you guys ever put temp sensors in motors afterwards?
[2022-05-12T21:33:57] Happy Giraffe: Is it a hard thing to do?
[2022-05-12T21:35:32] Oliver Eliasson: @artBula did on vsett 9
[2022-05-12T21:44:49] sombre_enfant: Hmu when u find the truth
[2022-05-12T22:04:37] Happy Giraffe: What?😂
[2022-05-12T22:07:06] Luis Magalhaes: If you can pass one signal wire to the motor should be easy after

[2022-05-15T21:24:19] rosheee: Now me solidworks noob The mission is 20S7P incl. bms 160mm x 470mm x 75mm
[2022-05-15T21:36:09] Paolo ⁭: But this is fusion xd
[2022-05-15T22:24:42] Unknown: That sounds very doable. My 20s9p came out to 460mm x 170 x 75
[2022-05-15T22:25:06] Unknown: Well, without BMS. BMS is on top and adds another 20mm of height
[2022-05-15T22:25:24] Unknown: Your length and width should be doable, maybe even 8p at 160mm
[2022-05-15T22:26:23] Unknown: Use JK active balancer and ditch the BMS altogether. Only plug in active balancer when needed, once every few cycles. Just wire in the balance leads and leave them exposed inside the deck. Active balancer can be plugged in only when/if needed to balance. Just a thought
[2022-05-15T22:27:16] Unknown: Use a big ass fuse on the mains and that will be your discharge catastrophe protection
[2022-05-15T22:27:51] Mirono escooters: Vesc ubdervoltage protection
[2022-05-15T22:28:06] Unknown: Had a buddy do it that way. Only plugs in the active balancer once every few cycles to make sure p groups are balanced. No bms. Working well
[2022-05-15T22:28:51] Mirono escooters: Or a small bms only used for charging
[2022-05-15T22:28:56] Unknown: Definitely need to make sure p groups are matched tho.. IR and capacity should be close
[2022-05-15T22:29:05] Unknown: Yup, that would work too
[2022-05-15T22:30:12] Mirono escooters: Prefer that, as if something goes extreemely wrong (you never know?) Bms still limits charge
[2022-05-15T23:03:56] Stan: Any thoughts or input on this battery?? https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AHPBcVNYhNJg9ViXji2eCEJUHMwQx_aU/view.

[2022-05-17T22:14:27] Unknown: I'm buying a spare 24F today to stash away with my spare 6F haha. I'm hoarding them. 24F maybe for upcoming monster ebike 👀👀👀 Well, if I hit the lotto 🤣
[2022-05-17T22:15:30] Mirono escooters: Haha i do the same
[2022-05-17T22:15:39] Mirono escooters: Buy vesc before project

[2022-05-17T22:19:40] Unknown: Yes of course. One of my 12Fs is potted and the other is not. My 6F is potted. My upcoming 24F will be potted. The potting compound also helps fets and cpu to run much cooler, vibration dampening and 100% waterproof. When buying new from Nucular, you choose potted or not potted. Potted has 3 year warranty and non potted has 2 year warranty

[2022-05-17T23:51:28] Mirono escooters: LOve it
[2022-05-17T23:57:09] Unknown: Same here. Lithium tech is getting better by the day. Now we are getting high capacity AND high discharge from cylindrical Li-Ion cells...impressive as hell. 4500mah with 50A discharge, like.. fo realzies!?
[2022-05-17T23:58:20] Unknown: 4p is 150-200a battery 😝. That is nuts
[2022-05-18T00:00:32] Mirono escooters: Finally 200a in xiaomi 4p
[2022-05-18T00:01:29] Кирилл: Finally, xiaomi motor will get the right power😁
[2022-05-18T00:05:00] Unknown: LoL. Tests by Mooch state 50a discharge to 80C, which is hot as hell. 50a is doable is short burst mostly to keep temps under 80C and to combat sag. True continuous rating is 35a, but nobody rides a scooter "continuous", so I don't see why 50a would be an overstatement. Maybe some passive deck cooling would help a lot
[2022-05-18T00:06:18] Happy Giraffe: 8$ each
[2022-05-18T00:06:20] Happy Giraffe: I bet
[2022-05-18T00:07:44] Happy Giraffe: Each and the ebike bottle holder battery cases that fit 4p have 40A contact points😂
[2022-05-18T00:07:57] Unknown: I don't even think they're available yet. I'm sure prices will even out as time goes on. But yea, I guess if you want the latest and greatest, there is always a premium price to pay lol
[2022-05-18T00:08:16] Happy Giraffe: Samsung 50S a myth
[2022-05-18T00:08:25] Happy Giraffe: Unavailable even at 12€ per cell lol
[2022-05-18T00:09:24] Unknown: In the review, Mooch compares this to 50S and says other than capacity the P45B beats the 50S in every way possible
[2022-05-18T00:09:58] Unknown: So if available at $8 per cell.. sounds like a steal 😂
[2022-05-18T00:11:08] Unknown: I'm sure as tech advances other companies will be coming out with high capacity high discharge cells as well. If not this particular cell, at least progress is being made in big ways
[2022-05-18T00:11:51] Happy Giraffe: Capacity at extreme amps might be closer than we think🤔
[2022-05-18T00:13:15] Unknown: Looking that way. Really exciting. They are finding new ways to stuff 10lbs of shit into 5lb buckets..so to speak 😆😆😆
[2022-05-18T00:14:03] Unknown: Same 21700 cylinder.
[2022-05-18T00:18:19] Happy Giraffe: I think I will be really happy with 48x, going in army in 6-7 weeks so not that much time to build ebike😅
[2022-05-18T00:20:28] Unknown: You really using 48X? Twinsies?
[2022-05-18T00:22:42] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I dont need that much amps. The motor cant take as much as QS205
[2022-05-18T00:23:04] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-05-18T00:26:32] Unknown: Awesome. My experience with them has been really good. I run 140-150a battery max settings on my Nucs, so 9p is around 15-16a per cell. Battery temps never exceeded 30C so far and sag is really solid. Only really pull those 150a when I'm full throttle on open straightaway, so typical riding around I estimate is 40-120a most of the time
[2022-05-18T00:29:45] Happy Giraffe: I plan about 12A per cell, so if 7p then ~85A batt
[2022-05-18T00:56:01] Unknown: Super safe. I think it may be one of the highest capacity cells with most wh and lowest sag in the 12a continuous range. My batch was insanely matched. I didn't do any IR or capacity tests on them, just assembled the battery randomly. Set at .010v delta, my active balancer has yet to kick on in 83 days or so and well over 500 miles of use

[2022-05-18T11:31:36] Happy Giraffe: Sensorless as it is, its fine but requires you to push scooter to start

[2022-05-18T14:17:01] Paolo ⁭: That depends by what output voltage you need

[2022-05-18T18:08:14] Paolo ⁭: The first mod I suggest you is remove the thermal pad and replace with kapton + thermal grease
[2022-05-18T18:08:41] Mirono escooters: Why kapton?? And no thermal pad?
[2022-05-18T18:08:56] Mirono escooters: In a xiaomi esc we replace kapton, and here we add it?
[2022-05-18T18:10:51] Paolo ⁭: If you’ve perfect flat surface kapton (the thinnest version) is better than thermal pad
[2022-05-18T18:11:19] Paolo ⁭: Thermal pad is ok for irregular surfaces like die casted case
[2022-05-18T18:11:33] Paolo ⁭: But this one is cnc made, should be better
[2022-05-18T18:12:29] Mirono escooters: Cool
[2022-05-18T18:12:37] Mirono escooters: What is xiaomi?

[2022-05-18T18:20:07] Paolo ⁭: This is did only for use less aluminium, if you do that with cnc will cost you more
[2022-05-18T18:20:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe if we would have a proper plate copy of yours my guy could make you the file for it
[2022-05-18T18:20:34] Mirono escooters: Ppl including me fill it with solder😂
[2022-05-18T18:21:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Problem is this a shit alloy takes heat badly

[2022-05-18T18:53:31] Happy Giraffe: Small disc requires more grip to be stopped but ofc your wheel also smaller
[2022-05-18T18:54:44] sombre_enfant: Dual disk front easy
[2022-05-18T18:56:20] Mirono escooters: Is this bcs of centrifugal or just bigger disk more brake area
[2022-05-18T18:56:53] Mirono escooters: I got 180 on mountainbike.. but it touches brake pad for like 80%. Cant touch it more, or need a bigger disk
[2022-05-18T18:57:10] Mirono escooters: I have no energy to mess with it, its rear anyways. Front 203mm and perrfect
[2022-05-18T18:57:38] rosheee: I just used rear disk
[2022-05-18T18:57:49] rosheee: I touch brakes 100%

[2022-05-18T19:21:57] Mirono escooters: Ok, so centrifugal
[2022-05-18T19:22:14] Mirono escooters: 120mm with xtech ez stop
[2022-05-18T19:24:32] Happy Giraffe: Well kinda

[2022-05-18T22:25:00] Artem Bulashev: Have a question for you high power maniacs
[2022-05-18T22:26:47] Face de Pin Sucé: We're here
[2022-05-18T22:27:08] Artem Bulashev: Can Ubox dual 100v handle those settings -180a phase 60a battery rear - 120a phase 50a batter front How about eu those mods - 3mm copper block under - sanded paint layer from ubox case - cut hole on top cover and install a fan
[2022-05-18T22:27:20] Artem Bulashev: 19s
[2022-05-18T22:27:51] Artem Bulashev: Or better go with 75v, same settings on 17s ?
[2022-05-18T22:29:45] Face de Pin Sucé: I think it's working
[2022-05-18T22:29:53] Face de Pin Sucé: But need those mods
[2022-05-18T22:30:47] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2022-05-18T22:31:01] Artem Bulashev: I feel like I saw such results with similar mods
[2022-05-18T22:31:15] Artem Bulashev: And even higher with ubox outside or with holes drilled
[2022-05-18T22:34:18] Artem Bulashev: So short term. For daily you will want lower power he said
[2022-05-18T22:54:16] Artem Bulashev: Also 75v dual on 17s any one experience?
[2022-05-18T22:56:37] Кирилл: I spoke with spintend team and they said "17s is still safe, but no regen pls". 18s is not safe. 16s is safe
[2022-05-18T22:58:15] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-05-18T22:58:25] Artem Bulashev: That’s general concept
[2022-05-18T22:58:57] Artem Bulashev: I think would be nice if we could programmed regen to switch off above specific voltage
[2022-05-18T22:59:22] Кирилл: wait, vesc tool doesnt have that option?🧐
[2022-05-18T22:59:52] Кирилл: even xiaomi has it in stock or custom fw
[2022-05-18T22:59:55] Paolo ⁭: @roscheeee
[2022-05-18T23:13:25] Artem Bulashev: Not sure

[2022-05-19T07:16:09] rosheee: also 18S is possible
[2022-05-19T07:16:17] rosheee: but not recommended

[2022-05-19T12:20:36] rosheee: Maybe wires to long
[2022-05-19T12:20:39] rosheee: Then no power
[2022-05-19T12:39:32] Luis Magalhaes: He says the wire is not getting too hot but the tips where it solder are

[2022-05-19T13:12:10] Mirono escooters: They are one of the best

[2022-05-19T22:31:24] rosheee: u do teh left hand throttle?
[2022-05-19T22:32:17] Mirono escooters: Who does left hand throttle 🤨😳
[2022-05-19T22:32:25] sombre_enfant: Trippin
[2022-05-19T22:32:42] Mirono escooters: Problably ebrake
[2022-05-19T22:32:50] Mirono escooters: At Right side another throttle
[2022-05-19T22:33:02] Mirono escooters: Same as my setup, ebrake throttle is nice
[2022-05-19T22:34:00] sombre_enfant: Need to fix dead zone and stuff later, do you know if i can add the on off brake sensor ?
[2022-05-19T22:34:19] Mirono escooters: Dead zone on those throttles suck
[2022-05-19T22:34:32] Mirono escooters: Why would you want a on off brake?
[2022-05-19T22:36:23] sombre_enfant: So if i shat my pants when theres a car or sum it cut my motor and apply some ebrake
[2022-05-19T22:37:02] Mirono escooters: But on off would feel horrible
[2022-05-19T22:37:03] Unknown: Kart has left handed trigger
[2022-05-19T22:37:30] Unknown: I use left handed trigger for variable/progressive ebrake and right handed trigger for throttle.
[2022-05-19T22:37:41] sombre_enfant: Can i only put like 10A on on off and like 0-30 on hall one ?

[2022-05-19T22:40:31] Mirono escooters: On my china esc it was on off even with linear brake, was horrible
[2022-05-19T22:43:55] sombre_enfant: On vesc its différent than basic chinese
[2022-05-19T22:54:11] Mirono escooters: Still.. u want something linear
[2022-05-19T22:54:21] Mirono escooters: Just glue sensor and magbet
[2022-05-19T23:08:02] sombre_enfant: No i dont want something else and messy

[2022-05-19T23:12:29] rosheee: Lol superbig
[2022-05-19T23:12:37] rosheee: U can use killswitch from my car
[2022-05-19T23:12:55] Mirono escooters: Superfun
[2022-05-19T23:13:00] Mirono escooters: Vesc no power button
[2022-05-19T23:13:06] Mirono escooters: Secobd option is a breaker
[2022-05-19T23:13:07] rosheee: With fire extinguiser zip
[2022-05-19T23:14:01] Mirono escooters: Think i go with breaker xd
[2022-05-19T23:14:59] Mirono escooters: Have this too😂
[2022-05-19T23:15:56] Mirono escooters: Need to find waterproof box for vesc, no risks
[2022-05-19T23:26:07] Happy Giraffe: Practice emergency stops
[2022-05-19T23:27:06] Happy Giraffe: And for emergency you kinda want disc brakes to have the feel in your hand
[2022-05-19T23:27:55] Happy Giraffe: If you remove your thumb when doing ebrake its too slow of a movement, you get off balance and braking not fast enough🌚
[2022-05-19T23:34:10] Unknown: What about the bafang ebrake sensor and magnet? Just need to glue the magnet to the brake lever and mount the small sensor
[2022-05-19T23:34:37] Unknown: <photos/photo_4342@19-05-2022_23-34-37.jpg>
[2022-05-19T23:35:29] Unknown: Can be used with any brake lever, but it switching on/off type. Not variable/progressive. I've seen guys mount hall sensor and magnet for variable e-brake
[2022-05-19T23:38:09] Unknown: <video_file>
[2022-05-19T23:42:09] Unknown: This hall sensor or similar from digikey is a few bucks, plus a simple magnet can easily turn any brake lever into variable/progressive Regen

[2022-05-20T01:21:50] Happy Giraffe: For what use do you want it?
[2022-05-20T07:35:27] Mirono escooters: To switch ebike on off
[2022-05-20T07:35:42] rosheee: <sticker>

[2022-05-20T12:31:53] Mirono escooters: It will be hidden ontop, hehe
[2022-05-20T12:32:00] Mirono escooters: Just fucking around
[2022-05-20T12:32:24] Mirono escooters: I need one for my powerwall anyways. Ill order 1 and test if its fun
[2022-05-20T12:38:24] Happy Giraffe: I wonder if power key could also function as motor lock
[2022-05-20T12:48:31] Mirono escooters: Get a 3 phase switch and short phases when not riding
[2022-05-20T12:48:39] Mirono escooters: Emergency brake aswell😀
[2022-05-20T13:05:36] Happy Giraffe: Emergency landing on your face😅
[2022-05-20T13:07:01] Izuna 生活: Hey. I am having this issue with my very new Flipsky 75100 VESC with v6.0 firmware (based on 75_300 with phase filtering disabled ofc). Motor is connected with hall sensor, but yet every time I start to accelerate it makes these noises and while driving keeps jittering. No faults. Nothing.
[2022-05-20T13:42:44] Izuna 生活: <video_file>
[2022-05-20T13:44:08] Mirono escooters: Idk, you wouldn't flip with shorted phases
[2022-05-20T13:45:45] Happy Giraffe: The stopping power of them is insane, have you tried it lol
[2022-05-20T13:46:38] Happy Giraffe: Did you do hall sensor setup?
[2022-05-20T13:46:47] Happy Giraffe: Dont use motor wizard for that
[2022-05-20T13:47:14] Izuna 生活: Yes. I have used sensorless before, that did not work very well, then connected the hall sensor. Still same issue.
[2022-05-20T13:47:37] Happy Giraffe: You need to let vesc autodetect hall angles etc
[2022-05-20T13:48:25] Happy Giraffe: Sometimes it and foc detect might give you bad values/results so could try again
[2022-05-20T13:53:50] Izuna 生活: The thing is that it was working yesterday (with sensorless). Then today, it stopped working out of nowhere with this noise and jiterring. Thought maybe connecting the hall sensor could help, nope.
[2022-05-20T14:15:43] rosheee: Flipsky
[2022-05-20T14:15:46] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-05-20T14:19:35] Gigolo Joe: Flash another firmware and check motor wires
[2022-05-20T14:20:29] Gigolo Joe: Also where'd u get v6 firmware There's 5.2 and 5.3
[2022-05-20T14:21:55] Izuna 生活: I compiled it myself from the bldc repository.
[2022-05-20T14:22:17] Gigolo Joe: U probably did something wrong
[2022-05-20T14:22:25] Izuna 生活: Yep I'll check the wires when I open it back up.
[2022-05-20T14:22:49] Happy Giraffe: Are you sure all phase cables are fully connected? Also the sensorless selected on vesctool? And halls uf you plug those in?
[2022-05-20T14:24:10] Happy Giraffe: I had some weird things happening and saw one phase was not fully plugged in🙈
[2022-05-20T14:36:14] Mirono escooters: Yes but wouldn't flip
[2022-05-20T14:47:35] rosheee: Now teh vesc test

[2022-05-20T15:18:45] Mirono escooters: Hope no crap, but was thic metal
[2022-05-20T15:18:59] sombre_enfant: Thick chinesium
[2022-05-20T15:19:11] Кирилл: Even with dual and 6kw, ofc no
[2022-05-20T15:19:21] Кирилл: Thats smth with wheel speed parameter
[2022-05-20T15:19:38] Mirono escooters: We shall see, dual torque arms and already thicccc dropouts of good metal
[2022-05-20T15:20:12] Happy Giraffe: You need tight torque arms, preferably too small so you need to file them 0.1mm for exact fit
[2022-05-20T15:20:16] Mirono escooters: Friend rode months without , its for backup and support
[2022-05-20T15:20:20] Mirono escooters: Better safe theb sorry
[2022-05-20T15:20:27] Mirono escooters: Lets see in 2h
[2022-05-20T15:20:55] Happy Giraffe: I ask 1cm stainless theel for each side with pinch bolt😂
[2022-05-20T15:21:20] Mirono escooters: Pinch bolt?
[2022-05-20T15:21:40] Happy Giraffe: The bolt that makes it super tight at the end
[2022-05-20T15:21:50] Happy Giraffe: So torque arm takes 99% of load
[2022-05-20T15:22:32] Happy Giraffe: Bit similar than eleek frames, the dropout is stronger than the axle

[2022-05-20T15:24:35] Happy Giraffe: 10mm thick steel and 6mm bolt at the end applying pressure. It aint going nowhere
[2022-05-20T15:24:47] Mirono escooters: Ahh. I saw that. Its nice design
[2022-05-20T15:24:54] Mirono escooters: Smort

[2022-05-20T16:28:01] rosheee: My thicc ass on wheel
[2022-05-20T17:01:27] sombre_enfant: For handle bar stuff what size i should get for the multicore wire who go in stem ?
[2022-05-20T17:03:46] Unknown: Can you check if controller has it or not?
[2022-05-20T18:06:40] Izuna 生活: Nope, nothing helps. Checked connectors, all good. Swapped motor with another one, done motor setup, same issue. (Checked with sensorless and hall sensor).
[2022-05-20T18:20:56] Izuna 生活: Yep, very likely. Seems to work with the 5.3 fw from eks8.
[2022-05-20T18:22:24] Izuna 生活: Anyone here with ready to use 6.0 fw for flipsky 75100V202 (blue board)?
[2022-05-20T18:34:47] Gigolo Joe: V6 doesn't support the hardware of the 75100
[2022-05-20T18:35:06] Gigolo Joe: Whether it's the 75100v1 or 75100v2
[2022-05-20T18:35:31] Izuna 生活: But I need Lisp (fuck this bs language) support 😬
[2022-05-20T18:35:58] Gigolo Joe: Lisp?
[2022-05-20T18:36:04] Gigolo Joe: W H A T
[2022-05-20T18:38:15] Izuna 生活: Yes fucking LISP
[2022-05-20T18:40:08] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-05-20T19:49:56] Gigolo Joe: WHAT DA FOCK IS LISP
[2022-05-20T19:50:57] Izuna 生活: LISP IS A OLD ASS PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE WHICH SUCKS SO BAD AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THEY DECIDED TO USE IT FOR VESC 6.0.
[2022-05-20T19:51:43] Izuna 生活: https://github.com/m365fw/vesc_tool/pull/1/files but at least it works when the firmware itself ... would be working.
[2022-05-20T20:07:28] Gigolo Joe: Y ARE U YELLING
[2022-05-20T20:40:19] Unknown: https://www.makerspev.com/products/little-focer-rev3-standard Hey guys... Just curious. What is the verdict on this Lil FOCer Rev3 VESC6 based controller? Looks like 100a batt and 250a phase limits.
[2022-05-20T20:45:10] Face de Pin Sucé: WTF impossible that speed at that power I pull more than 15kW at 135Kmh

[2022-05-20T22:02:32] Artem Bulashev: Super convenient place! Soo natural
[2022-05-20T22:04:04] Artem Bulashev: Also lower section is FULLY CNC ready now! And added a retaining m1.4 screw because case will act as cable retainer. Will use 5 pin Julet cable for MCU inside this throttle 😇
[2022-05-20T22:07:07] Artem Bulashev: 3 output signal - bidirectional for programmable controllers like vesc (3.3v) - single way throttle (mid to max, below is ignored) 5v for normall controllers - brake line (-20% position will close signal line to ground = ebrake on normal controller)
[2022-05-20T22:07:59] Artem Bulashev: Physical limiter if you don’t want to have scroll back on normal controller (don’t want to use ebrake at -20%)
[2022-05-20T22:19:24] Unknown: Beautiful man. Can't wait for a unit to test out ☺️

[2022-05-20T23:15:24] Mirono escooters: Is it ok to add a washer between a brake adaptor and side? I need it a few mm further back.. or will there be too much force on wahseeq
[2022-05-20T23:31:03] Happy Giraffe: If you do, make sure it doesn't decrease the surface area of the structural rigidity
[2022-05-20T23:31:11] Mirono escooters: Oki
[2022-05-20T23:31:25] Happy Giraffe: A narrow spacer will make it wobbly

[2022-05-20T23:32:50] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_4351@20-05-2022_23-32-50.jpg>
[2022-05-20T23:34:09] Mirono escooters: There 1 or 2 😳
[2022-05-20T23:34:41] Mirono escooters: Bcs now brake is like max distance shifted to right.. and it still rubs super slightly
[2022-05-20T23:42:02] Mirono escooters: Ill for now use washers, and order a diff spacer to see, its really millimetres work
[2022-05-20T23:42:12] Mirono escooters: I cant remove washer of motor to make it sit closer
[2022-05-20T23:48:39] Unknown: Maybe instead of 2 washers 9nly at the screw holes, use a very thin piece of metal that will act as a spacer, rather than a washer. That way the force will be distributed more evenly
[2022-05-20T23:49:21] Mirono escooters: Fair point, just needs 2 drilled holes then
[2022-05-20T23:49:27] Mirono escooters: Where would i find that
[2022-05-20T23:49:35] Unknown: Like a spare piece of nickel sheet for welding. Just use as a very thin spacer and cut to fit dimension of the bracket
[2022-05-20T23:50:09] Unknown: It will simply be a sandwiched spacer. The force will still go to the screws themseleves
[2022-05-20T23:50:22] Unknown: The spacer doesn't have to have super strong integrity
[2022-05-20T23:50:25] Mirono escooters: Fair point. Good idea
[2022-05-20T23:50:30] Unknown: Unless it was a thick spacer
[2022-05-20T23:50:51] Unknown: Just a thought 🤔
[2022-05-20T23:50:55] Mirono escooters: With 2 washers im afraid it will just bend, i need some stopping power.. without washers its pushed flat against the side
[2022-05-20T23:51:09] Mirono escooters: Urgh,.my mm luck at it
[2022-05-20T23:54:29] Mirono escooters: I dont Know if i under or overestimate metal strongnesq A 22mm nut.. how hard should i tighten it. With this socket wrench, it has a small lever length, i just do max my force allows. :p
[2022-05-20T23:55:18] Mirono escooters: And i just realised, i can problably add the super small washer from my torque arm kit i did not use, it will add the little space i need. Tomorrow ill checl

[2022-05-21T03:28:31] Artem Bulashev: Guys people confirmed in Russian chat
[2022-05-21T03:28:53] Artem Bulashev: Filling up the ubox dual with compound reduced temp twice!
[2022-05-21T03:30:21] Artem Bulashev: Also one person tested - Ubox dual screwed to deck with cheap paste (no over heat) - than removed paste = over heat (20+c) - installed again with cheap paste, back to good temp! Massive difference with and withiut paste

[2022-05-21T03:52:06] Artem Bulashev: I asked will see
[2022-05-21T03:52:19] Artem Bulashev: It is in hall park of 170a phase and 80a battery
[2022-05-21T03:52:22] Unknown: Proper potting compound is exactly like ferrofluid for motors. Creates contact between PCB and outer case/heatsink. My potted 12F on the rear runs cooler than my non potted 12F on the front and the rear controller works muchh harder (75/200 vs 65/130)
[2022-05-21T03:52:50] Artem Bulashev: And ubox fets layed with heatsink side to the PCB
[2022-05-21T03:53:02] Artem Bulashev: so cooling pcb down cools fets

[2022-05-21T04:06:12] rosheee: Isolated..
[2022-05-21T04:06:56] rosheee: 😭
[2022-05-21T04:07:56] rosheee: U kidding guys
[2022-05-21T04:54:31] Unknown: Controllers stay nice cool. Also have them sandwiches on plexiglass and 5mm thermal pad to keep vibrations down and further helps draw heat away. The 12Fs aren't working super hard so they only get a few C above ambient under hardest conditions lol
[2022-05-21T05:03:00] Unknown: I'd say about 90% of custom high power setups I've seen have controllers mounted externally in some fashion. Usually because the controllers are too large to fit inside deck, deck space is needed for high discharge/capacity battery and air cooling is the best for keeping temp down. Most of these high power setups aren't made to ride in the rain since the tires would lose traction anyways, so controllers outside isn't an issue. Even so, when mounted outside with wires facing down, the case keeps them well protected. Ubox has an odd port/wire design and case, so external placement would make mounting a challenge
[2022-05-21T05:04:04] rosheee: Ok ^^'
[2022-05-21T05:05:43] rosheee: Sooo..
[2022-05-21T05:05:52] rosheee: My rion tronics who can produce peak 300A
[2022-05-21T05:05:57] rosheee: 😂
[2022-05-21T05:06:05] rosheee: More than ur 12F
[2022-05-21T05:06:09] rosheee: How fit them outside?
[2022-05-21T05:06:44] rosheee: Because odd design
[2022-05-21T05:07:21] rosheee: If u mount ur controllers to a aluminiumboard cooling increase
[2022-05-21T05:07:27] rosheee: 🙈
[2022-05-21T05:15:12] rosheee: How warm is your box after 10min fullboost ride?
[2022-05-21T05:43:12] rosheee: Plexiglas is isolator
[2022-05-21T05:45:01] Unknown: I told you, a few degrees above ambient at most
[2022-05-21T05:45:26] Unknown: Plexiglass is for rigidity since stem isn't flush or square
[2022-05-21T05:47:10] Unknown: I have absolutely zero problems with controller temps, they stay cool always. My motors are the limiting factor but as powerful as they are, I'm happy with my setup just the way it is. I'm not stressing my controllers, battery or motors. All components are happy and so am I
[2022-05-21T05:48:15] rosheee: So they stay at 25C degrees with max load like 30?
[2022-05-21T05:58:42] Unknown: Warmest I've seen them go was 84F/28C when it was 75F outside. That was with 75a batt and 200a phase or rear and 65a batt and 130a phase front. I'm pretty sure it was the front controller, rear is potted, front is not. Highest temp between the 2 controllers is displayed, I didn't check which one it was
[2022-05-21T06:01:01] rosheee: Cam u show pls
[2022-05-21T06:01:19] rosheee: t° middle 100 h — the average temperature of the Сontroller over the last 100 hours. t° middle — the average temperature of the Сontroller over all time.

[2022-05-22T21:47:39] Artem Bulashev: I heard you. Changed whole design of mounting
[2022-05-22T21:49:22] Artem Bulashev: Now only one ring design (not refined yet). But existing holes for the mounting screw and the clamp screw are used as a hinge and a mounting screw for the buttons as well, see video. No extra screws or holes needed to mount “button-module”
[2022-05-22T21:49:22] Artem Bulashev: <video_file>
[2022-05-22T21:52:52] Artem Bulashev: Also can now increase size of buttons to 16mm and there are 3 way switches in that size! If you guys find buttons you want, send me links! 🙂🙂

[2022-05-23T14:48:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i don't think it's the best idea to put buttons on the top. weird thumb moves. i clearly don't like it 😰
[2022-05-23T14:50:10] rosheee: Depends on ur thumb
[2022-05-23T14:51:16] Artem Bulashev: Do you have 3d printer ?

[2022-05-23T14:53:43] Artem Bulashev: What buttons and where would you like them? (Are you type of person that likes buttons only under handle bar?- not possible on thumb throttle side than ?
[2022-05-23T14:54:17] Artem Bulashev: Will do 👍 later tonight
[2022-05-23T14:54:34] rosheee: <sticker>

[2022-05-23T15:52:17] Paolo ⁭: I think too @koxx3, is needed revision of costs. Not a criticism but suggestion, can’t you find some other way to made it cheaper? Maybe not everyone need 100% super high quality components
[2022-05-23T15:53:42] Happy Giraffe: What was 200€ then is 350€ now
[2022-05-23T15:53:56] Happy Giraffe: War, after covid, sanctions
[2022-05-23T15:54:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: already looking at this. but almost impossible with small batches. 3d prints, electronic, glass, screen, cables, buttons, assembly, taxes, shipping, investments... so, yes, it will target premium. i even need to register as apple dev (ios app in progress)
[2022-05-23T15:55:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: so, yes, it will target premium
[2022-05-23T15:56:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: try to develop a product, you'll understand 😔
[2022-05-23T15:57:02] Happy Giraffe: If premium works fine and is finalized in design. Perhaps you can make a cut down version with limited features🤔
[2022-05-23T15:57:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: each part individually doesn't cost much... but to obtain the final product, it's another story.
[2022-05-23T15:57:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: exactly
[2022-05-23T15:58:11] Happy Giraffe: I found not needing display that much anymore so basic features would suit me best
[2022-05-23T15:58:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i tried to find a chinese company able to build the full product, but it's a mess. they are lost and can't provide everything. not so easy to produce in china if you are there.
[2022-05-23T15:59:33] Happy Giraffe: Dealing inside EU already hurts the brain😂
[2022-05-23T15:59:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes 😅
[2022-05-23T16:11:56] Paolo ⁭: Yes I’ve no doubt about product quality, but if you sell it at lower price you will earn more. It’s very hard to spent 400€ for a display

[2022-05-23T18:17:18] Paolo ⁭: Oh right , too much shunt on minimotors = no work
[2022-05-23T18:17:33] Face de Pin Sucé: We have one working here
[2022-05-23T18:17:36] Paolo ⁭: Only noise and no torque , less than without shunt

[2022-05-24T15:53:53] Happy Giraffe: Motor tab gives more accurate results
[2022-05-24T15:54:17] Happy Giraffe: Try and see yourself
[2022-05-24T15:54:33] Mirono escooters: Thatsounds weird
[2022-05-24T15:57:48] rosheee: Lol
[2022-05-24T15:57:53] rosheee: I got the same
[2022-05-24T15:57:54] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-05-24T15:58:02] rosheee: It changes every test lul
[2022-05-24T15:58:20] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-05-24T15:58:31] Happy Giraffe: For me better motor tab🌚
[2022-05-24T15:58:39] rosheee: Try motor setup
[2022-05-24T15:58:43] rosheee: I try motor tab
[2022-05-24T15:58:44] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-05-24T15:58:47] Mirono escooters: Eh who listens to max values anyways
[2022-05-24T15:58:54] rosheee: Me
[2022-05-24T15:59:04] Mirono escooters: They accurately?
[2022-05-24T15:59:10] rosheee: Idk
[2022-05-24T15:59:12] Happy Giraffe: I used motor set first, wasnt good so switched to motor tab
[2022-05-24T15:59:13] Mirono escooters: Bcs if that is true.. kuch. Rip motor
[2022-05-24T15:59:28] Happy Giraffe: What?
[2022-05-24T16:00:02] Mirono escooters: What
[2022-05-24T16:00:15] Mirono escooters: Max 50a for my ebike motor, am at 150😋
[2022-05-24T16:00:45] rosheee: Hmm i dont work t9day on svooter
[2022-05-24T16:00:55] Happy Giraffe: Those are DC amps I guess
[2022-05-24T16:01:01] Happy Giraffe: Depends on Kv aswell
[2022-05-24T16:01:08] Mirono escooters: God knows
[2022-05-24T16:01:24] Mirono escooters: I just ride and check temp sensor
[2022-05-24T16:01:25] Happy Giraffe: Same amp limit isnt true for different winds
[2022-05-24T16:01:31] Happy Giraffe: Yep
[2022-05-24T16:01:37] Happy Giraffe: Use common sense
[2022-05-24T16:02:00] Mirono escooters: I cant get my motor to heat, at all, maybe a little. Ferrofluid would lower even more
[2022-05-24T16:02:10] Mirono escooters: Maybe i open it when i go install 203mm disk
[2022-05-24T16:04:33] Happy Giraffe: Should be good then
[2022-05-24T16:20:34] Artem Bulashev: Guys
[2022-05-24T16:20:41] Artem Bulashev: Need your input on design
[2022-05-24T16:20:43] Artem Bulashev: All ok?
[2022-05-24T16:20:59] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_4434@24-05-2022_16-20-59.jpg>

[2022-05-24T16:32:53] Unknown: Would the button portion be removable at all? Or is it built into the design/housing? I tend to think it might be around 50/50 for those who want the buttons and those who just want the throttle by itself 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-05-24T16:33:26] Unknown: I do like the 2 buttons in a short row better than the stacked 3 buttons
[2022-05-24T16:46:38] Artem Bulashev: It is now Modular
[2022-05-24T16:46:41] Artem Bulashev: 😊😊👌
[2022-05-24T16:47:14] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_4440@24-05-2022_16-47-14.jpg>
[2022-05-24T16:49:18] Artem Bulashev: Button mounts by sliding into hole on the ring and then hold down by clamping screw 👌😊
[2022-05-24T16:49:49] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2022-05-24T16:50:11] Artem Bulashev: Those are 12mm buttons though . 2 position only thus, momentary
[2022-05-24T16:50:22] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_4441@24-05-2022_16-50-22.jpg>
[2022-05-24T16:50:50] Artem Bulashev: A lot smaller than dual 16mm + single 12mm

[2022-05-24T17:06:28] Happy Giraffe: Theres 100v/200A continuous they say lol, no phase filtering
[2022-05-24T17:06:38] Mirono escooters: My makerx going good
[2022-05-24T17:08:08] Artem Bulashev: Aerlang h6 pro
[2022-05-24T17:08:27] Artem Bulashev: Great scooter but that deck just breaks up front or at the back
[2022-05-24T17:09:15] Artem Bulashev: But has god acceleration for 500w and very good all in one controller with BT and led control and very good wheels, never flat
[2022-05-24T17:10:18] Happy Giraffe: I bet 300A phase melts this in 1 second, it has 18 fets but they didnt dare to share pic
[2022-05-24T17:10:37] Happy Giraffe: Its PaoloWu sticker library😂
[2022-05-24T17:11:53] Mirono escooters: U can always ask wich mos
[2022-05-24T17:12:20] Mirono escooters: 200a max mine,at 150, will go 200 when i shortened motor cables and used better con.ectors
[2022-05-24T17:13:00] Happy Giraffe: People say on FB that Maker burned in 20mins without heat. Poor construction, I guess its Flipsky#2 lottery
[2022-05-24T17:13:35] Mirono escooters: Mine works and looked good inside. No solder balls either
[2022-05-24T17:14:49] Mirono escooters: Will see long term
[2022-05-24T17:15:05] Mirono escooters: But overheating, but thats very n9rmal. It heats less the i thought
[2022-05-24T17:17:06] Happy Giraffe: What temps you get then?
[2022-05-24T17:17:26] Mirono escooters: 70 after 30 mins hardcore 45/150a
[2022-05-24T17:17:28] Happy Giraffe: Also how every vesc measure temps is different, depending what probe is used and where
[2022-05-24T17:17:34] Mirono escooters: 50kmh loads of braking
[2022-05-24T17:17:44] Mirono escooters: It feels correct, haha
[2022-05-24T17:17:51] Happy Giraffe: Doesnt perform much better than spintend single🙈
[2022-05-24T17:17:57] rosheee: Where?
[2022-05-24T17:18:03] Mirono escooters: I wasnt proving that
[2022-05-24T17:18:07] Happy Giraffe: Two lines up
[2022-05-24T17:18:10] rosheee: Depends on your cooling
[2022-05-24T17:18:16] rosheee: Can u help me?
[2022-05-24T17:18:18] Mirono escooters: Atleast mine has good contacts with thermal pads. Wink wink
[2022-05-24T17:18:30] Happy Giraffe: Mine too🌚
[2022-05-24T17:18:36] Mirono escooters: For it to be in a bag, it performs quite well
[2022-05-24T17:18:47] Mirono escooters: I will figure out some way to cool it
[2022-05-24T17:18:48] Happy Giraffe: But needs to be bolted with paste upside down for cooling
[2022-05-24T17:18:55] Mirono escooters: Smort
[2022-05-24T17:18:59] Mirono escooters: Mine not. Xd
[2022-05-24T17:19:08] Happy Giraffe: I dont have it even optimal atm haha
[2022-05-24T17:19:18] Mirono escooters: After exams ill flip something together, problably a heatsink stickibg out witj air cooling
[2022-05-24T17:19:35] Happy Giraffe: If design sucks cant do much
[2022-05-24T17:20:06] Mirono escooters: This design iz ok for extra cooling
[2022-05-24T17:20:39] Mirono escooters: After exams, for now bag works 😁

[2022-05-24T17:22:43] Happy Giraffe: Trampa also heavy promises on 200A continuous
[2022-05-24T17:24:54] Mirono escooters: That pric3..
[2022-05-24T17:34:41] Happy Giraffe: If it doesnt explode its reasonable
[2022-05-24T17:35:02] Happy Giraffe: And if it's real 200A phase
[2022-05-24T17:35:16] Happy Giraffe: Would be just enough for me with low kv motor
[2022-05-24T17:36:17] Mirono escooters: Hmhmhm idk. Expensive
[2022-05-24T17:36:28] Mirono escooters: Ebikes better off with sabvoton or so, for tjat power
[2022-05-24T17:39:21] Happy Giraffe: Everything is relative
[2022-05-24T17:39:48] Happy Giraffe: Too big and not reliable enough if they randomly fail
[2022-05-24T17:40:02] Mirono escooters: Vesc fails more then sabvotonhere. Xd
[2022-05-24T17:40:13] Mirono escooters: But mine doa, so i cant speak good for it. Lol
[2022-05-24T17:40:17] Happy Giraffe: Spintend still going strong
[2022-05-24T17:40:22] Mirono escooters: For a student 🤣
[2022-05-24T17:40:24] Happy Giraffe: Soon 5000km
[2022-05-24T17:40:28] Mirono escooters: Nice
[2022-05-24T17:40:47] Mirono escooters: Sabvoton or kelly, both are well known and used ib communities th9
[2022-05-24T17:41:30] Happy Giraffe: I like vesc features and programmability, need smart police modes etc. Also seems like best software by far
[2022-05-24T17:41:40] Mirono escooters: Me too
[2022-05-24T17:41:44] Mirono escooters: Vesc is future
[2022-05-24T17:41:55] Mirono escooters: Sabvoton horrible app.
[2022-05-24T17:42:05] Happy Giraffe: Maybe spintend will do the promised 100v single with non-retard cooling
[2022-05-24T17:42:10] Mirono escooters: Im happy with vesc bike, just fix overheat ans tada
[2022-05-24T17:42:28] Mirono escooters: Sabvoton size is like ×10, so temperatures are almost unbelieva
[2022-05-24T17:42:44] Mirono escooters: I could reuse sabvoton housing.. waterproof ans thic
[2022-05-24T17:43:41] Happy Giraffe: If Trampa vesc is gay then I can go Kelly. Best option would be Paolos vesc but it might not be ready in time for me. Maybe I should ride the Leopard 2A7 from the army until then😅
[2022-05-24T17:44:00] Mirono escooters: In 69 years its done
[2022-05-24T17:44:21] Happy Giraffe: Low Kv and 20s will kick ass big time
[2022-05-24T17:44:32] Mirono escooters: Oh yea
[2022-05-24T17:44:35] Mirono escooters: Same as my scoot motor
[2022-05-24T17:45:17] Happy Giraffe: Especially with temp sensor so I dont cook the low kv motor😅
[2022-05-24T17:45:51] Mirono escooters: 🤣
[2022-05-24T17:45:54] Mirono escooters: Same
[2022-05-24T18:48:17] Happy Giraffe: Let us know how Tronic works...I might have to buy one aswell
[2022-05-24T19:19:58] Gigolo Joe: 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
[2022-05-24T20:27:13] Artem Bulashev: Made engraving too

[2022-05-24T20:30:57] Artem Bulashev: Now looks like final product 😄 love it
[2022-05-24T20:34:29] D J: Me too 👌
[2022-05-24T21:20:54] Unknown: That is really sharp man. I like it. I'm curious to know how the wiring for the throttle/brake will be implemented. Shared +5v/GND, throttle signal and brake signal... 4 wire? And then 2 contact wires for each momentary button?
[2022-05-24T21:25:46] Happy Giraffe: Vesc should have a momentary button for 5 sec power boost, like exceeding normal batt amps by 50%😂
[2022-05-24T21:27:00] Happy Giraffe: Then have a robotic voice say "turbo activated"
[2022-05-24T21:27:16] Mirono escooters: Nuclear detonation imminent
[2022-05-24T21:28:03] Happy Giraffe: "Autobots, roll out" VroooOooOom
[2022-05-24T21:40:39] Artem Bulashev: Here is full list :) Final design of Spin-Y throttle: - Scroll forword will work on normall controller like vsett / mini motors - Scroll back will have physical lock if you don’t want to scroll back, other wise Scroll back will activate E-brake at -20% position. Strength on e-brake is set by original display 😊✅ - Cruise control button on the back! ☺️ works a lot better than original time based cruise inside Vsett / minimotor and other controllers 😜 —- It can also output signal so you can connect it to what you want, like horn - Modular buttons on top, will sell as an option. Dual 12mm - Total 6 wires from throttle. Short Manual I will write and incl as QR code - 0 band adjustment knob for one way throttle (for basic controllers) to remove dead zone completely (you move throttle scooter does it right away) ———— extra info ———- - water protective coating 😍 - micro computer (MCU) handles all the functions - 3.3v bi-directional output for smart controllers (vesc & others) - 5v one way throttle - dedicated e-brake wire that will close loop and make normal controllers engage ebrake 🙂 ———— wires ———- 1. Power 5v 2. Ground 3. Bi-directional throttle (3.3v logic - smart controllers) 4. One way throttle (5v logic - normal controllers) 5. Brake line loop - (ebrake - normal controllers) 6. Cruise control button external signal ——— on board adjustments——- - knob to change start value for one way throttle (normal controller), this way you can adjust it to the band where you controller picks up throttle input without “deadband” right away as you move throttle.
[2022-05-24T21:47:13] sombre_enfant: Why option😐
[2022-05-24T21:52:11] Oliver Eliasson: Looks amazing, when does shipping start?
[2022-05-24T21:57:05] Artem Bulashev: Many people don’t want many buttons
[2022-05-24T21:57:31] Artem Bulashev: Many people don’t want buttons above (even though those are very well located)
[2022-05-24T21:57:40] Artem Bulashev: Many people want cheaper and basic
[2022-05-24T21:58:05] Artem Bulashev: Also I personally hate when something I don’t need occupied ANY extra space
[2022-05-24T21:59:38] Artem Bulashev: So this whole design is built with - zero waisted volume / space. Inside throttle all parts move with in about 0.4mm from each other 😅😅 very tightly done and thus over all dimensions are as small as possible with such large swing wheel (important for high precision control)
[2022-05-24T22:02:31] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_4445@24-05-2022_22-02-31.jpg>
[2022-05-24T22:02:31] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_4446@24-05-2022_22-02-31.jpg>
[2022-05-24T22:02:31] Artem Bulashev: Here it is without buttons module
[2022-05-24T22:04:07] Unknown: I do like the dual overhead buttons personally. Perfect for my lights and 3 speed mode cycling. Will be able to eliminate my 2 button module
[2022-05-24T22:04:55] Artem Bulashev: 👌
[2022-05-24T22:05:28] Artem Bulashev: Question guys, do you have anything on left of throttle now?
[2022-05-24T22:05:47] Artem Bulashev: Some people said that buttons should only protrude one way but not the other
[2022-05-24T22:06:13] Artem Bulashev: I feel like it would be too far into handle grip
[2022-05-24T22:06:21] Unknown: Momentary button (old Vsett horn button) for my main power on/off is located to the left of my throttle and brake lever
[2022-05-24T22:06:41] Artem Bulashev: Photo?
[2022-05-24T22:08:00] Oliver Eliasson: This is dual 12mm right? Is there three way switch for that? (L, M, H speed) or will there be a module with one 12mm and one 16mm available?
[2022-05-24T22:08:08] Unknown: <photos/photo_3059@17-03-2022_00-02-48.jpg>
[2022-05-24T22:08:09] Unknown: <photos/photo_3058@17-03-2022_00-02-47.jpg>
[2022-05-24T22:08:44] Artem Bulashev: And I made a cut out to fit any brakes levers there, hopefully it will be enough to have brake lever flat against throttle mount
[2022-05-24T22:09:07] Artem Bulashev: You have brake lever next to it
[2022-05-24T22:10:15] Artem Bulashev: 29mm = 1.14inch the buttons module
[2022-05-24T22:10:54] Artem Bulashev: That is what I also consider
[2022-05-24T22:11:22] Artem Bulashev: Problem with even 16mm 3 way switch they are like 40mm long!!! So need to be very high 🤦‍♂️
[2022-05-24T22:11:58] Oliver Eliasson: If offset to the left maybe,
[2022-05-24T22:12:17] Artem Bulashev: Here is 16mm dual + 1 12mm vs new dual 12mm
[2022-05-24T22:12:41] Artem Bulashev: I think it would be a worth while design yeah
[2022-05-24T22:12:55] Artem Bulashev: 16 + 12mm
[2022-05-24T22:13:07] Artem Bulashev: Have you found 16mm 3 way switch ?
[2022-05-24T22:13:09] Oliver Eliasson: <photos/photo_4453@24-05-2022_22-13-09.jpg>
[2022-05-24T22:13:15] Oliver Eliasson: Have not checked
[2022-05-24T22:14:34] Artem Bulashev: Yes like so
[2022-05-24T22:14:38] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_4454@24-05-2022_22-14-38.jpg>
[2022-05-24T22:15:06] Artem Bulashev: This is about the only 3 way screw in switch I was able to find in 16mm

[2022-05-24T22:18:40] Oliver Eliasson: Something like this maybe?

[2022-05-24T22:25:23] Oliver Eliasson: That maybe?
[2022-05-24T22:36:35] Artem Bulashev: 30mm at the back 10mm sticks out of the front :)
[2022-05-24T22:36:54] Artem Bulashev: Better with 40mm at the back and nothing sticking out on front than
[2022-05-24T22:37:05] Oliver Eliasson: Yeah
[2022-05-24T22:37:43] Artem Bulashev: Those require small pcb to be made and multi-part assembly of buttons module
[2022-05-24T22:44:09] Happy Giraffe: Cruise control button hell yeah
[2022-05-24T22:45:24] Artem Bulashev: Yeap and direct 3.3v bi-direction adc for both throttle and variable regen 🤓
[2022-05-24T22:48:27] Artem Bulashev: In theory there will be 2-3 wire inside that are not occupied if you are using smart controller and using cruise function - one way throttle cable - ebrake cable - cruise button external function cable Oh wow, Modular buttons require gnd (can be shared), and than 12v, signal1, signal2 - 3 new wires, that we have unused on throttle 😍😉
[2022-05-24T22:49:44] Artem Bulashev: So you could them working through same throttle wiring actually as there is 3 wires unused than 😎
[2022-05-24T23:01:42] Happy Giraffe: Even standalone button set could be cool, iex go down to legal power mode without needing to reboot. Cruise and some other function maybe
[2022-05-25T01:55:16] Artem Bulashev: If any one wants to print and see how it fit their scooters (dimentions check - opening 23mm, main body 16.4mm thick)
[2022-05-25T01:56:42] Artem Bulashev: It is all in one simplified version without internals, so it prints all at once 🙂 Let me know how you like erganomics if you do print :)
[2022-05-25T11:37:52] Artem Bulashev: Oliver
[2022-05-25T12:47:09] sombre_enfant: Can i use 1k resistor to precharge esc ?
[2022-05-25T13:01:02] Artem Bulashev: As anti-spark connector ?
[2022-05-25T13:06:10] sombre_enfant: Only pre charge
[2022-05-25T13:06:40] sombre_enfant: Tried resistor heated need lower value and faster connection

[2022-05-26T20:09:56] Happy Giraffe: Single motor gets stressed more than two
[2022-05-26T20:10:08] Happy Giraffe: You end up spending more time on higher phase
[2022-05-26T21:17:30] Happy Giraffe: Adam @artBula do you guys know if there is copper strip thats already nickel plated?🤔
[2022-05-26T21:26:59] Unknown: There is but only in 10mm wide as far as I know... One sec...
[2022-05-26T21:28:25] Paolo ⁭: I goes single motor with flipsky
[2022-05-26T21:31:38] Unknown: I got a roll of this but didn't end using it
[2022-05-26T21:32:11] Unknown: .15 nickel plated copper strip. 8mm wide (for use with plastic cell holders... Or not lol)
[2022-05-26T21:32:33] Mirono escooters: You can just spotweld that?
[2022-05-26T21:32:40] Unknown: I bought 25 feet of it
[2022-05-26T21:32:44] Unknown: Yup exactly
[2022-05-26T21:32:47] Mirono escooters: Cool
[2022-05-26T21:33:09] Mirono escooters: Why people donr use it more? Must b a reason
[2022-05-26T21:33:14] Unknown: Bummer it only comes in 8mm wide though. Only works as "strips", not plates ya kno
[2022-05-26T21:34:01] Unknown: It's not very common. This came from the USA K-Weld dealer. Only place I ever saw it... Plus 8mm wide only
[2022-05-26T21:34:15] Mirono escooters: Damnet
[2022-05-26T21:34:22] Mirono escooters: Ill keep doing sandwiches
[2022-05-26T21:35:29] Mirono escooters: I will need to do a special size for ebike. Copper would reduce my layers greatly.. :)
[2022-05-26T21:35:32] Unknown: Yup, they work just fine. If I was using cell spacers and 15a per cell max, I would definitely use this. But plates, especially copper plates with nickel tabs, have much less resistance, v drop and heat dissipation than any 8mm wide strip ever could
[2022-05-26T21:35:43] Happy Giraffe: How many amps it can do then being .15mm and 8mm wide?
[2022-05-26T21:35:56] Happy Giraffe: Oh lol, just when I was typing
[2022-05-26T21:35:59] Unknown: It says rated to 15a per cell/connection
[2022-05-26T21:36:33] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, might be an option to me then
[2022-05-26T21:36:40] Unknown: 8mm wide .15 pure nickel is only "rated" for like 4a 🙈🙈
[2022-05-26T21:37:17] Unknown: I would never ever ever build a battery with nickel only. Ever lol. Copper simply has way too many benefits not to
[2022-05-26T21:37:59] Unknown: Nickel is used and is popular ONLY because it welds easy. Benefits end there
[2022-05-26T21:38:41] Unknown: Perfect for low amp mass produced batteries.
[2022-05-26T21:39:36] Happy Giraffe: If I go mid drive motor I won't need so many amps🤔 this would be best then
[2022-05-26T21:40:27] Unknown: Amps are only one aspect. Voltage drop, overall connection resistance and heat dissipation are all things to consider
[2022-05-26T21:40:48] Unknown: Copper acts as a heat sink whereas nickel acts as an insulator
[2022-05-26T21:41:14] Happy Giraffe: Saw some 6000€ ebikes on restaurant parking. Who idiot pays that for 250w nominal motor and 25kmh🙈
[2022-05-26T21:41:27] Mirono escooters: For anything above 25a, same
[2022-05-26T21:41:33] Unknown: Even if amp draw is within rated amps, your voltage drop will be higher with nickel due to higher resistance
[2022-05-26T21:41:46] Happy Giraffe: All connects to amps tho🌚
[2022-05-26T21:41:49] Unknown: Don't let amp draw be the only thing to consider
[2022-05-26T21:41:55] Unknown: In a way yes...
[2022-05-26T21:42:03] Mirono escooters: Legalisation costs shitload of amount, sadly,
[2022-05-26T21:42:14] Mirono escooters: But its a good indicator.
[2022-05-26T21:42:22] Unknown: It is..
[2022-05-26T21:42:27] Happy Giraffe: Naah, but it's prebuilt
[2022-05-26T21:42:31] Mirono escooters: My bike will defo be copper. I will take a long time to perfect it
[2022-05-26T21:42:41] Mirono escooters: Yes, they have to legalise it
[2022-05-26T21:43:07] Mirono escooters: Cars cost millions, but just mass production drops it Ebikes less bulk price
[2022-05-26T21:43:18] Unknown: For sure. Any home built battery that will be used personally I recommend copper. If building for someone else or mass producing packs, nickel is easiest route
[2022-05-26T21:43:34] Mirono escooters: Dads next ebike will be own build, fuck greedy expensive bikes
[2022-05-26T21:44:10] Mirono escooters: Indeed. Ans 60a.. loads of nickel layers😀
[2022-05-26T21:44:13] Unknown: Hopefully I'll be day for me. Have spare Nuc 24F and display on the way to stash away haha
[2022-05-26T21:45:37] Happy Giraffe: No, anything under 25kmh pedal assist legal in Finland
[2022-05-26T21:45:47] Unknown: That works too but 2 layers of .1 don't equal .2... Since contact/coverage isn't 100%. I would estimate 2 layers of .1 would equal around .16-.17
[2022-05-26T21:48:20] Mirono escooters: I know, so copper itis
[2022-05-26T21:53:17] Luis Magalhaes: Where do you guys buy the cooper for the battery's?
[2022-05-26T21:56:00] Unknown: I bought all of mine on ebay. Usually jewelry suppliers or hobby suppliers will have rolls of it. I found 200mm long x 100mm wide sheets of .1 and .15 pure copper for super cheap. Just cut the 100mm widths down to what I needed
[2022-05-26T21:56:50] Luis Magalhaes: Nice will check 👌
[2022-05-26T21:57:31] Unknown: <photos/photo_4482@26-05-2022_21-57-31.jpg>
[2022-05-26T21:58:26] Luis Magalhaes: Tks
[2022-05-26T22:00:06] Luis Magalhaes: My friend bought some but says it takes too long to arrive
[2022-05-26T22:00:18] Luis Magalhaes: Dont know where he buy it
[2022-05-26T22:35:14] Happy Giraffe: Buy it and then get small fast batch😳
[2022-05-26T22:43:46] Luis Magalhaes: Let me ask where he is buying😅
[2022-05-26T22:57:16] Happy Giraffe: Ofc, wasnt saying your shouldn't😂
[2022-05-26T23:29:57] rosheee: Copper only And nickel on top

[2022-05-26T23:41:41] Martin Kaktits: Yesterday, honestly, I think these tires saved me from rolling in the mud :D was drivign home, raining, on dirt road and I felt the scoot slip in some potholes, but grip just eenough to keep control.

[2022-05-27T04:16:19] Artem Bulashev: What you welded with?
[2022-05-27T04:21:32] Unknown: K weld or Malectrics I'm guessing.

[2022-05-27T20:57:07] Artem Bulashev: I’m a hater
[2022-05-27T20:57:22] Artem Bulashev: But this size is intersting as my deck plan to be 58mm lol
[2022-05-27T20:57:26] Artem Bulashev: Perfect fit
[2022-05-27T20:57:48] Artem Bulashev: And would allow for 45cm battery instead of 40-41cm long
[2022-05-27T20:58:13] Artem Bulashev: That’s already 14s long 2 layers
[2022-05-27T20:58:26] Artem Bulashev: And then some more space left
[2022-05-27T20:59:24] Happy Giraffe: Cant really like a product that fails for no reason😂
[2022-05-27T20:59:45] Happy Giraffe: Spintend has issues but once fixed, its damn reliable
[2022-05-27T21:01:51] Artem Bulashev: I can fit 2 in side with copper sheet 5mm in between on paste here
[2022-05-27T21:02:17] Artem Bulashev: And than have 46cm for battery
[2022-05-27T21:02:30] Artem Bulashev: That would be nuts
[2022-05-27T21:02:38] Mirono escooters: Im just lucky, i guess.. mine work fibe
[2022-05-27T21:02:52] Artem Bulashev: But not this new one
[2022-05-27T21:02:56] Mirono escooters: That would indeed be super nice
[2022-05-27T21:03:07] Paolo ⁭: 47C😍
[2022-05-27T21:03:18] Artem Bulashev: As we know flip sky….. 10 models total shit and 1 model good
[2022-05-27T21:03:49] Artem Bulashev: So we know 75100 was good at first than they added fucked up tripple resistors on top of each other
[2022-05-27T21:03:50] Happy Giraffe: We could keep a reliability log if people wouldn't run them over spec this much😂
[2022-05-27T21:04:04] Artem Bulashev: That’s another thing
[2022-05-27T21:04:20] Mirono escooters: Half this chat does ×3 😀
[2022-05-27T21:04:25] Artem Bulashev: I would be going 95a phase and 40a max absolute
[2022-05-27T21:04:33] Mirono escooters: Thats not mucj
[2022-05-27T21:04:36] Mirono escooters: I would give it a go
[2022-05-27T21:04:45] Artem Bulashev: Yeah in specs I think
[2022-05-27T21:04:51] Mirono escooters: Test it within 10 days, dispute option
[2022-05-27T21:05:03] Mirono escooters: Even more, juzt dont confirm delivery quick
[2022-05-27T21:05:05] Artem Bulashev: If I can install it that fast
[2022-05-27T21:05:08] Mirono escooters: Surely
[2022-05-27T21:05:25] Happy Giraffe: Im amazed the single now works without paste, I would need to place it upside down which I dont want to anymore as only 2 more weeks riding🌚
[2022-05-27T21:05:42] Happy Giraffe: 48/120Amps
[2022-05-27T21:05:49] Mirono escooters: Then ebike 😀

[2022-05-27T21:12:50] Happy Giraffe: So damn hard to decide mid-drive CYC Stealth/Pro gen 2 with BAC vs. Mxus Turbo with vesc🙈
[2022-05-27T21:13:23] Happy Giraffe: They have custom app for the BAC so I can fiddle around a lot

[2022-05-27T21:15:13] Face de Pin Sucé: Speed is accurate
[2022-05-27T21:17:47] Happy Giraffe: They let you do that?
[2022-05-27T21:18:11] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, they don't care
[2022-05-27T21:18:36] Happy Giraffe: It is heavy and puts all weight on back. Its a tradeoff between raw torque and agility
[2022-05-27T21:18:58] Happy Giraffe: Damn, thats cool. You can tip the waiter and thank so they let you do it later😂

[2022-05-27T21:27:57] Face de Pin Sucé: Shimano Saint 🔥
[2022-05-27T21:29:15] Mirono escooters: Someone can sell me copper strip in eu? 0.2mm preferably. And 30mm or more wide
[2022-05-27T21:29:26] Face de Pin Sucé: It's sad telemetry is retarded, you brake harder than speed shows x) you're almost stopped and it shows 50Kmh
[2022-05-27T21:33:35] Artem Bulashev: I have copper sheet roll

[2022-05-27T21:34:09] Artem Bulashev: May be with steel cut tabs
[2022-05-27T21:34:10] Mirono escooters: I have just welded 0.2 ;)
[2022-05-27T21:34:16] Artem Bulashev: With?

[2022-05-27T21:35:00] Artem Bulashev: Nickel or nickel plated steel?
[2022-05-27T21:35:03] Mirono escooters: Great
[2022-05-27T21:35:15] Mirono escooters: Plated, spotwelds copper better
[2022-05-27T21:35:22] Artem Bulashev: That’s why 👌
[2022-05-27T21:35:31] Artem Bulashev: With steel it is a lot easier indeed
[2022-05-27T21:36:00] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I use turnigy lips 8000mah 140-280c
[2022-05-27T21:36:11] Mirono escooters: Copper is damn nice. Ebike i need copper, but ofc i fucked up dimensions.. ans i dont wanna cut copper 32 times in random sizes, to then spotweld each
[2022-05-27T21:36:11] Artem Bulashev: Malectrics

[2022-05-28T21:51:06] Martin Kaktits: Is there any reason my brakes (xiaomi xtech) would be STRONGER when wet? Usually they are weaker when raining, but today bleeded them and they developed this new behavior. Literally just a few drops of water on the pads and they go from "it will do I guess" to "shit me, almost threw myself over the handlebars" how, makes no sense to me. Changed pads too, both old and new metallic. Cleaned disc ofc.
[2022-05-28T21:52:26] Martin Kaktits: They go back to being meh when the water dries up. Thnen back to holly shit when I wet them again

[2022-05-28T23:55:03] Paolo ⁭: Then means super hard “suspension”
[2022-05-28T23:55:19] Face de Pin Sucé: yes, for track purposes
[2022-05-28T23:55:25] Face de Pin Sucé: but also, nice geometry
[2022-05-28T23:55:41] Paolo ⁭: If you’ve lowered like extreme you will have lot wobble😂
[2022-05-28T23:55:43] Face de Pin Sucé: you can have the hardest suspension, if geometry is bad, it will wobble at high speed
[2022-05-28T23:55:59] Face de Pin Sucé: I hate Extreme design x)

[2022-05-29T00:20:56] Artem Bulashev: Same but high speed scooters must have
[2022-05-29T00:26:59] Unknown: LoL... Indeed. But race scooter doesn't need lights. Too cool for lights 😜😝
[2022-05-29T00:31:22] Unknown: I actually have all 4 of my lights set to 35% max brightness (around 3a total) and it's perfect. It doesn't blind oncoming traffic quite so bad and is still plentyyyy bright. Got the light situation locked down.
[2022-05-29T00:31:41] Unknown: Only thing left, literally the only thing left to do lol... I think I'll be doing Magura mt5 estop with MDR-C rotors (not mt5e with sensor). Estop has 2 finger aluminum levers and ebike pads by default. Mt5e has 3 finger plastic levers and typical performance pads. Was also looking at Shimano and Hope but Magura mt5 series is sort of hard to beat for the money
[2022-05-29T00:32:52] Кирилл: Lightning McQueen approves😂
[2022-05-29T00:33:09] Unknown: Shimano saints and Hope X3 are both sweet too but pricey compared to Magura
[2022-05-29T00:33:43] Unknown: Haha. Well played. Great movies 🤣
[2022-05-29T01:10:26] Happy Giraffe: Magura pads are shit
[2022-05-29T01:10:39] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-05-29T01:10:43] rosheee: they are
[2022-05-29T01:11:00] Happy Giraffe: Their performance whatever blahblah 20€ for less than 500km on scooter, second set wore down even faster
[2022-05-29T01:11:22] Happy Giraffe: Get full metallics if you dont want to change pads every other week
[2022-05-29T01:12:25] Happy Giraffe: It's not bashing them, I used them for 1000km and didn't like how fast they wear. Scooter tire so close to ground, dirt and sand it makes them wear faster than on bike
[2022-05-29T01:12:52] rosheee: "SCAMURA"
[2022-05-29T01:23:19] Face de Pin Sucé: I don't have

[2022-05-29T01:25:19] Happy Giraffe: It's ok for bikes I guess
[2022-05-29T01:25:29] rosheee: yah but the sinter pads needed
[2022-05-29T01:25:55] rosheee: yah sad for you happy
[2022-05-29T01:26:08] rosheee: BUT since u used the original pads -> warranty 100%
[2022-05-29T01:30:43] Happy Giraffe: I used orig and performance
[2022-05-29T01:51:39] Unknown: Cool cool. Thanks for the info. Magura doesn't make sintered pads do they? Which brand/type pads would you recommend for mt5 on a scooter?
[2022-05-29T01:51:56] rosheee: KOOL STOP SINTER

[2022-05-29T02:09:03] Unknown: I asked on Vsett chat and didn't get a clear answer. Maybe someone here would have some additional input... Question for all the Magura/Aftermarket brake users. I know there have been struggles to get the brake line/banjo on the opposite side of the caliper (using the M6 bleed port for the new brake line location) and has caused some headaches finding the exact parts need. Then an M5 bleed port adapter is needed for bleeding. Since Vsett 10 (and zero 10x, 11x, Vsett 11, etc..) swingarms are symmetrical, is there a reason why the standard isn't to just flip flop the brakes to the opposite side? Rear right swingarm to front left and vice versa and then just install motor opposite direction, change tire and rotor direction and done. Has anyone done this? or does anyone have input on if this would work or present any issues?

[2022-05-29T16:44:13] Mirono escooters: Really stopped with a dyno?.
[2022-05-29T16:44:19] Happy Giraffe: Yes...
[2022-05-29T16:44:21] Mirono escooters: I should consider a profile too
[2022-05-29T16:44:29] Happy Giraffe: You are an idiot if you dont
[2022-05-29T16:44:32] Mirono escooters: How u do it, swap on phone
[2022-05-29T16:44:37] Mirono escooters: Sounds like me!
[2022-05-29T16:44:47] Happy Giraffe: If they saw it go 60+ freewheel the fine is much more....
[2022-05-29T16:45:05] Happy Giraffe: I was praying vesc profile to work and boy did it deliver😂
[2022-05-29T16:45:16] Mirono escooters: Got charged, nothing?
[2022-05-29T16:45:30] Happy Giraffe: Like I said, 400€ where as student I pay 200€
[2022-05-29T16:45:36] Mirono escooters: Wtf
[2022-05-29T16:45:41] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-05-29T16:45:43] Mirono escooters: What did they charge you for
[2022-05-29T16:46:09] Happy Giraffe: For going over 20 and not having legal lights. Tho my lights are 100x better than regular bike shit
[2022-05-29T16:46:38] Mirono escooters: Why no 20kmh vesc profile
[2022-05-29T16:46:42] Happy Giraffe: Im lucky I got 10,000km before this happened so made lot of money with scooter already
[2022-05-29T16:46:51] Happy Giraffe: Too obvious
[2022-05-29T16:46:53] Mirono escooters: 4 weeks before u sell it, lol
[2022-05-29T16:46:56] Mirono escooters: Mehhh
[2022-05-29T16:46:57] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2022-05-29T16:47:14] Mirono escooters: Shit police should focus on real crime
[2022-05-29T16:47:25] Happy Giraffe: I told them straight away its 30 and 1000w, police was really nice and respectful
[2022-05-29T16:47:43] Luis Magalhaes: 😅
[2022-05-29T16:47:58] Happy Giraffe: If I show them 20kmh they tell Im hiding something. He asked about button if its 2-profiles and I said its just power on/off
[2022-05-29T16:48:02] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-05-29T16:48:27] Unknown: Damn that is so crazy in EU. I *don't think* that would ever happen in the States
[2022-05-29T16:48:28] Mirono escooters: Eh, they cant do anything even if they know there are 2 profiles..
[2022-05-29T16:48:37] Mirono escooters: You lucky about that
[2022-05-29T16:48:43] Happy Giraffe: Then they dig deeper and make a big case
[2022-05-29T16:48:47] Unknown: So far 🤞 lol
[2022-05-29T16:49:01] Mirono escooters: I jusr see so many US electric motorcycles. Just removed pedalq. And never problems. Ride on road
[2022-05-29T16:49:05] Happy Giraffe: Me too 10,000km no issues riding past police everyday
[2022-05-29T16:49:08] Mirono escooters: Belgium would never
[2022-05-29T16:50:13] Unknown: Hmm... Hard to believe they are that knowledgeable about it. I bet cops in my hick town don't even know what the damn thing is lol
[2022-05-29T16:50:44] Mirono escooters: Same here
[2022-05-29T16:51:00] Mirono escooters: And being young helps, always think you dont know anything
[2022-05-29T16:51:04] Mirono escooters: Talking simple to me
[2022-05-29T16:53:48] Unknown: Yea I can see that. I'm still not 100% confident I won't ever be bothered. If they see me going 60mph on a side road we might have problems LoL. As far as I know, my state has a 25mph speed limit and eye protection must be worn. That's it. No wattage limit, no helmet laws (even for motorcycles).
[2022-05-29T16:54:24] Mirono escooters: Haha, i am scared if they see me, but i pass cops so much
[2022-05-29T16:54:35] Mirono escooters: Ebike is gettibg more obvious then scoot tho
[2022-05-29T16:54:38] Mirono escooters: And stricter laws
[2022-05-29T16:54:55] Unknown: Oh wow, is it really?
[2022-05-29T16:55:12] Mirono escooters: I mean, i cant pedal
[2022-05-29T16:55:24] Mirono escooters: Its obvious. And big motor, big bag, loads of wires
[2022-05-29T16:55:29] Unknown: I'm not sure if even the dumbest cop would believe this thing only goes 25mph tops 😂😂
[2022-05-29T16:55:34] Mirono escooters: Scooters are allowed, look less obvious
[2022-05-29T16:55:43] Unknown: Gotcha gotcha
[2022-05-29T16:55:43] Mirono escooters: Xiaomi helps me in my case 😀
[2022-05-29T16:56:06] Luis Magalhaes: Yet, in portugal no one cares and some police have scooters of they own too 😂
[2022-05-29T16:56:19] Mirono escooters: We do see regular posts of scooters on rollers, there was tjis discusion bcs they found a 104kmh scoot
[2022-05-29T16:56:23] Unknown: Yea I bet man. I have a 500w single motor scooter and that thing is perfect for running to the gas station or putting around
[2022-05-29T16:56:59] Unknown: Oh damn. So crazy how different countries can view it
[2022-05-29T16:57:58] Luis Magalhaes: But don't have laws for it yet, just for 250W scooters to use it on bicycle roads
[2022-05-29T16:58:32] Luis Magalhaes: Have a power limit and speed to use it in those roads
[2022-05-29T16:59:17] Unknown: Oh I see. That's still not so bad at all. So anything other than that they want you riding with traffic on the road?
[2022-05-29T17:00:22] Luis Magalhaes: They don't know 😂😂
[2022-05-29T17:00:45] Unknown: Oh shit 😂 too funny
[2022-05-29T17:01:18] Luis Magalhaes: I can't use bikelanes but have no laws saying i can use it on car roads 😂
[2022-05-29T17:01:43] Luis Magalhaes: The order now is to do nothing
[2022-05-29T17:01:46] Unknown: That works out pretty good then 😝
[2022-05-29T17:02:05] Luis Magalhaes: If i dont do shit they dont care 😂
[2022-05-29T17:03:10] Unknown: Sweet. I think it's the same here in USA. I live in the country but went to Providence (bigger city) last weekend and there were scooters and ebikes everywhere. Never saw so many in my life. Was really cool
[2022-05-29T17:07:19] Luis Magalhaes: I live in a smaller city too here i see many xiaomis and 250w scooter now but bigger ones no

[2022-05-29T17:15:33] rosheee: Disnt knew that before posting
[2022-05-29T17:15:40] Unknown: It's easy to see by the efficiency
[2022-05-29T17:15:57] rosheee: Just had eyes for mosfet temp

[2022-05-29T17:35:04] Artem Bulashev: Dualtron has suspention that you can’t modify
[2022-05-29T17:36:04] Artem Bulashev: You can’t fit shocks with re coil control like Exa or A5
[2022-05-29T17:39:49] Unknown: Omg lol. This battery. After an 8 mile ride delta voltage difference is .000V 😝

[2022-05-29T22:14:32] rosheee: battery is a bit shorter cables are in the stem and rear cables come directly from motor -> esc
[2022-05-29T22:14:38] Mirono escooters: With rails gone?
[2022-05-29T22:14:49] rosheee: ofc

[2022-05-29T22:26:09] Mirono escooters: Paolo?
[2022-05-29T22:26:19] rosheee: @PaoloWu
[2022-05-29T22:26:45] Mirono escooters: Ah lol
[2022-05-29T22:35:53] rosheee: hmm
[2022-05-30T00:40:34] rosheee: ok
[2022-05-30T00:40:35] rosheee: i found it
[2022-05-30T00:40:53] rosheee: the absolute hardest vescs atm for me XD
[2022-05-30T00:41:11] rosheee: <photos/photo_4539@30-05-2022_00-41-11.jpg>
[2022-05-30T00:41:14] rosheee: 130V (150V rated mosfets"
[2022-05-30T00:41:33] rosheee: and Shuntless current sensor design with capacity to measure up to 1000A
[2022-05-30T00:41:35] Face de Pin Sucé: Too big this one
[2022-05-30T00:41:48] rosheee: Remote connectivity package (includes on board GPS, GSM/LTE module with 3 year service included. International coverage for 70 countries). Allows to locate/track the vehicle, and send commands such as engage brake/panic mode, and anything else that makes sense - new commands will be added via updates).
[2022-05-30T00:42:10] rosheee: 1kg per vesc lol
[2022-05-30T00:42:26] rosheee: 0.6kg is heatsink
[2022-05-30T00:42:26] rosheee: XD
[2022-05-30T00:42:32] rosheee: So, the controller itself is only 0.4kg.
[2022-05-30T00:43:15] rosheee: Hi amp traces are reinforced with copper. I haven't tried 600A just yet, don't have a load to test it at those amps. But tried 150A batt, 300A phase on a bike. Works fine. Temperature goes up to 40-45C max.
[2022-05-30T00:46:04] rosheee: and it is out of production
[2022-05-30T00:46:04] rosheee: omfg
[2022-05-30T07:30:49] Gigolo Joe: BIG BOI battery has arrived, vesc is gonna git hottt

[2022-05-30T11:46:04] Gigolo Joe: Looking good! 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
[2022-05-30T12:19:51] Artem Bulashev: We need controller version without display 😁😁 would also make it a lot cheaper - no casing, no display, no glass, no transportation costs and import costs and production costs 😄 Just like “bare bone edition for poor” - not even cables 😄😄 we figure it out haha (just like pi comes in anti static bag and nothing else lol
[2022-05-30T12:49:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😅late
[2022-05-30T12:49:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yesterday was kids day 😁
[2022-05-30T13:49:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: later may be. everything is ready at software level, but this is not the most request feature 😉
[2022-05-30T13:49:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lol. production is hard 😅
[2022-05-30T13:51:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Just joking bro 😁
[2022-05-30T13:52:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also means 20 units to test ,stress test 😁
[2022-05-30T13:56:22] Happy Giraffe: I might have to go ASI Bac so cant test the screen in Finnish winter😅

[2022-05-30T15:02:38] Artem Bulashev: Hope eventually version without screen will come as well 👌😊
[2022-05-30T15:02:46] Artem Bulashev: Don’t want to pay fines
[2022-05-30T15:02:48] Artem Bulashev: ☺️

[2022-05-30T15:59:25] rosheee: Can watch p0rn
[2022-05-30T16:18:07] Happy Giraffe: Lol, use phone🌚 but yeah 120kmh with phone is a bit meh
[2022-05-30T16:18:17] rosheee: No prob
[2022-05-30T16:18:22] rosheee: 114kmh eZ
[2022-05-30T16:18:37] Paolo ⁭: 120kmh no prob with 18s
[2022-05-30T16:18:37] rosheee: Go pro is b0ss Had it on top at 330kmh

[2022-05-30T17:45:38] Face de Pin Sucé: Yeah
[2022-05-30T17:45:48] Face de Pin Sucé: I'm sure he crashed
[2022-05-30T17:51:58] Paolo ⁭: But anyway 3mm carbon is little for this high speed scooter lol
[2022-05-30T17:59:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤣🤣
[2022-05-30T18:03:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what ? the smartdisplay ? http://www.etbprod.o2switch.net/SmartElec/
[2022-05-30T18:09:31] Happy Giraffe: Oh was it that he had?
[2022-05-30T18:14:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes. we work together. rage mecahnics will do the assembly.
[2022-05-30T18:16:50] Happy Giraffe: That's cool!
[2022-05-30T18:17:38] Happy Giraffe: I can't stress enough how useful the vesc profiles are after dealing with police, display for easy switching also nice
[2022-05-30T18:17:56] Happy Giraffe: He even tried the power button to change modes😂
[2022-05-30T18:19:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: speed limit at startup is useful too... for insurance in case of crash 😅
[2022-05-30T18:46:02] Artem Bulashev: 100%
[2022-05-30T19:17:43] rosheee: Ehehe cooling
[2022-05-30T19:17:44] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-05-30T19:32:10] rosheee: And this is for controller airflow
[2022-05-30T19:32:41] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-05-30T19:32:44] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-05-30T19:33:20] rosheee: Cut box and add something like this
[2022-05-30T19:33:20] rosheee: <photos/photo_4545@30-05-2022_19-33-20.jpg>
[2022-05-30T19:33:40] Mirono escooters: My plan
[2022-05-30T20:08:25] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_4546@30-05-2022_20-08-25.jpg>
[2022-05-30T20:08:36] Mirono escooters: How would you directly spotweld copper? No way?
[2022-05-30T20:11:59] Paolo ⁭: No
[2022-05-30T20:14:12] Mirono escooters: I saw something with tungsten tips. Also no?
[2022-05-30T20:14:19] Mirono escooters: Ill stick with sandwich
[2022-05-30T20:18:30] Happy Giraffe: Goodluck getting baseplate flat against all mosfets with good, even pressure😂
[2022-05-30T20:18:35] Paolo ⁭: Not tips problem
[2022-05-30T20:19:10] Paolo ⁭: Copper cant be fused with nickel, the welding is super fragile due to oxigen
[2022-05-30T20:19:25] Paolo ⁭: If you have argon gas you can try
[2022-05-30T20:21:19] Unknown: Especially .2 copper. No way. Even with split
[2022-05-30T20:21:59] Unknown: Even if welder is strong enough, K-Weld with super caps say.. you'd be introducing a lot of heat to the cell. Especially on the negative can side
[2022-05-30T20:22:29] Unknown: Positive tab is floating so not as crucial, positive can take a lot more heat before it goes into the cell
[2022-05-30T20:23:18] Unknown: Copper probe tips direct to copper, especially .2, will stick (ruin your probes quickly) and the heat will disperse too fast to get a solid weld. I welded a handful of copper to copper welds on .1 and it was okay. Probes did stick a bit but also only using enough heat for .1
[2022-05-30T20:27:55] Mirono escooters: Okidoki , sad
[2022-05-30T20:28:01] Mirono escooters: Sandwich is da way
[2022-05-30T20:29:24] Unknown: Is. I mean, you can use that 2p copper... Just would be wise to also use nickel or plated steel tabs on top as a weld aid. Also, .2 copper is thick. I used .1 but also bought .15 to experiment with. .15 is definitely weldable but welds were super strong and consistent with .1
[2022-05-30T20:29:45] Mirono escooters: I will use 0.1 too
[2022-05-30T20:30:02] Unknown: Is equal to (actually better than) .4 nickel
[2022-05-30T20:30:13] Mirono escooters: Love copper,.with 0.3mm×6 nickel i would need so much for 60a
[2022-05-30T20:33:23] rosheee: alrdy solved
[2022-05-30T20:33:53] Happy Giraffe: Show🌚
[2022-05-30T20:34:01] Happy Giraffe: Or doesnt exist😘
[2022-05-30T20:55:08] Artem Bulashev: May be 0.1
[2022-05-30T20:55:16] Artem Bulashev: But would need high settings
[2022-05-30T20:55:24] Artem Bulashev: Better take 0.1 nickel strip
[2022-05-30T20:55:28] Artem Bulashev: A lot easier
[2022-05-30T20:55:38] Artem Bulashev: Or even nickel plated steel even easier
[2022-05-30T20:57:20] Mirono escooters: Okidoki
[2022-05-30T20:58:23] rosheee: EHGEHEH

[2022-05-31T01:07:56] Unknown: @PaoloWu I have an extra pair of motor covers... Would drilling air hole in only 1 side do anything for cooling? Point is, I'd be willing to maybe experiment with a spare motor cover... I wonder if ferrofluid would stay in the motor if holes were drilled on the inner portion of the cover... 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-05-31T01:08:23] rosheee: Yes it does
[2022-05-31T01:09:17] rosheee: Have u opened motors again?
[2022-05-31T01:09:24] Unknown: Weather is getting warmer. Ride today was about 80F ambient and windings got up to 170F... Still not really too bad but still
[2022-05-31T01:09:57] Unknown: I've opened my Vsett motors dozens of times lol. Changing bearings, simmerings, adding ferrofluid, wiring....
[2022-05-31T01:10:50] Unknown: I have no hesitation opening my motors 😝
[2022-05-31T01:11:34] Unknown: Wish I could get the 3d file or just buy 2 motor coolers like Pirate sells. Can't seem to find them or get in touch with anyone who can
[2022-05-31T01:17:50] Paolo ⁭: Don’t use ferrofluid with holes
[2022-05-31T01:18:32] Paolo ⁭: Will become a super hard material, and ferrofluid will be useless and damage your motor
[2022-05-31T01:23:55] Unknown: Got it got it 👍. Will dry out from the air flow if it stays in place
[2022-05-31T01:37:19] Paolo ⁭: Remove before ferrofluid if want test
[2022-05-31T01:37:48] rosheee: Ir dried out even everyday uuse lul

[2022-05-31T04:05:14] Unknown: I guess washers could be added and still use stock swingarm shafts. Should be enough threads to work

[2022-05-31T09:51:04] rosheee: and which scooter?
[2022-05-31T09:51:12] rosheee: i learned that dualtron has inefficient crap motors

[2022-05-31T09:58:37] Luis Magalhaes: At 25% i see 80A at the internal battery (the only one that has smart bms)
[2022-05-31T09:58:51] Luis Magalhaes: So it is pulling more then that
[2022-05-31T10:01:26] Luis Magalhaes: First time i test it i was at 80% battery thinking about the 80A each 7218 does and it cuts out 😂
[2022-05-31T10:06:26] Face de Pin Sucé: Take Dualtron and better motors
[2022-05-31T10:12:18] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂

[2022-05-31T17:44:47] Happy Giraffe: MT5e based on MT7 pro
[2022-05-31T17:45:09] Unknown: Wow, strange. A friend of mine got the mt5e and has 3 finger plastic lever with sensor and was trying to find an aluminum lever to switch.. couldn't find anything

[2022-05-31T17:47:30] rosheee: High-quality aluminium was used as the basic construction material. The master cylinder is made entirely of solid aluminium – and it is the production process that gives this ABS-compatible component its extremely high level of rigidity and ultra-light weight.

[2022-05-31T22:30:33] Mirono escooters: Sensorless did not
[2022-05-31T22:31:01] Mirono escooters: What is that? I cant seem to pinpoint it. Like it loses phase for a split second? Badly read halls?
[2022-05-31T22:32:20] Mirono escooters: On video louder as irl, overeccates it but i can feel it too
[2022-06-01T00:28:16] Happy Giraffe: Retest hall and foc parameters and double check cabling
[2022-06-01T00:35:23] Mirono escooters: Does it matter if your halls arent connected in normal sequence?

[2022-06-01T19:44:58] Paolo ⁭: My kelly 7218 200A rated pass more current
[2022-06-01T19:44:59] Luis Magalhaes: Forget that 😂
[2022-06-01T19:53:12] Face de Pin Sucé: Measure phase current x)
[2022-06-01T19:54:07] Paolo ⁭: What I can use (except oscilloscope)
[2022-06-01T19:54:32] Unknown: 😂😂
[2022-06-01T19:54:43] Paolo ⁭: But what was shorted? Phase wire or motor windingV
[2022-06-01T20:04:10] Face de Pin Sucé: Pince ampèremétrique
[2022-06-01T20:04:16] Face de Pin Sucé: Phase wire
[2022-06-01T20:11:04] Paolo ⁭: Current in phase wire is AC, you can’t measure pulses , only the continuos power
[2022-06-01T20:44:57] Mirono escooters: Now Bluetooth refused to connect
[2022-06-01T20:45:00] Mirono escooters: But vesc works
[2022-06-01T20:45:08] Mirono escooters: Before ride connected After. Not
[2022-06-01T20:52:50] Mirono escooters: Green led.. vesc is fine
[2022-06-01T20:54:39] Mirono escooters: Reboot phone, problem persists
[2022-06-01T21:02:15] Mirono escooters: So, pc detects vesc but i get access denied. Wtf?
[2022-06-01T21:03:20] Mirono escooters: Ok, vesc works on pc. Luckily.. so its Bluetooth thats or dead or doodoo
[2022-06-01T21:18:04] Mirono escooters: Last update, problably for a while Its not oversaturated, it does it even at 40a phase (altough verry little. But still there) As my cables look a little bit knackered, i will just open motor, confirm sensors work and check everything, and meanwhile rewire it. If it then persists. Its vesc :) (And ofc statorade it)
[2022-06-01T22:06:49] Happy Giraffe: I'm blessed my single vesc always worked😅
[2022-06-01T22:07:14] Mirono escooters: God knows what it is now, many factors
[2022-06-01T22:07:21] Mirono escooters: Im gonna bet on my motor itself
[2022-06-01T22:07:32] Mirono escooters: I do miss my Bluetooth. Lol
[2022-06-01T22:08:02] Happy Giraffe: Just double check cables and check that ADC+UART is enabled
[2022-06-01T22:10:49] Mirono escooters: It worked before i went out for a drive
[2022-06-01T22:11:19] Mirono escooters: I did change the ms you said, and it like did not give a green notice at bottom wich i found weird? Maybe i pressed something wrong there?
[2022-06-01T22:11:21] Unknown: When did it stop working
[2022-06-01T22:11:37] Mirono escooters: Or after i went into settings or after a ride..
[2022-06-01T22:11:47] Unknown: Maybe a bad wire?
[2022-06-01T22:12:12] Mirono escooters: Happy made a valid point, i problably misclicked in my dumbness because it did not update what i initially changed
[2022-06-01T22:12:32] Unknown: Oh ok
[2022-06-01T22:12:56] Mirono escooters: Ill check in a bit, haha, i hope its that
[2022-06-01T22:13:04] Mirono escooters: 1 problem solved otherwise
[2022-06-01T22:13:30] Unknown: Lets hope
[2022-06-01T22:14:48] Mirono escooters: Would vesc detect 2 of 3 halls and say halls are working?
[2022-06-01T22:15:02] Mirono escooters: But tjen just.. badly? Or is it 3 or nothing
[2022-06-01T22:16:13] Unknown: Think it would give an error if not reading 3, or detect nothing at all
[2022-06-01T22:17:07] Mirono escooters: Can i check halls in vesc? I mean see if they really change
[2022-06-01T22:18:14] Unknown: Idk, you can measure the funcionallity of your halls though
[2022-06-01T22:18:54] Unknown: Maybe in plane mode you can setup readings for that
[2022-06-01T22:19:25] Happy Giraffe: Can also have halls powered and measure with multimeter but careful not to short
[2022-06-01T22:20:04] Mirono escooters: Yes, but a vesc would be handier
[2022-06-01T22:20:59] Mirono escooters: I have to replace wiring someday anyways, and ferrofluid is never bad, ill just go all the way and do both. Wire is looking sketchy
[2022-06-01T22:21:20] Happy Giraffe: Maybe you can see hall angles on vesc app, try
[2022-06-01T22:21:28] Happy Giraffe: I cant remember anymore
[2022-06-01T22:21:40] Mirono escooters: I couldnt find immediately
[2022-06-01T22:22:23] Unknown: It's easy to measure tho lots of vids on how to measure out hall sensors
[2022-06-01T22:46:56] Mirono escooters: @Happy_Giraffe i owe you a beer
[2022-06-01T22:47:11] Mirono escooters: I indeed had selected adc and not uart.. :)
[2022-06-01T22:47:19] Mirono escooters: Bluetooth works!
[2022-06-01T22:51:42] Unknown: 😂
[2022-06-01T22:52:12] Unknown: Shit happens my friend 👌
[2022-06-01T22:55:31] Gigolo Joe: GUYS weird problem 75100v2 on 6.0 firmware, motor cogs a bit (goes BRRR) around 45 kmh checked sensors, phase cables, tried different settings for sensor and sensorless modes. Nothing helps
[2022-06-01T22:55:45] Gigolo Joe: No errors in log
[2022-06-01T22:56:01] Mirono escooters: With me too much
[2022-06-01T22:56:22] sombre_enfant: Sucé
[2022-06-01T22:56:30] Gigolo Joe: It's dat 6.0 firmware
[2022-06-01T22:56:51] Mirono escooters: Nah, some old firmware
[2022-06-01T22:56:54] Mirono escooters: But it works
[2022-06-01T22:56:58] Gigolo Joe: It did gave out a whole lot of power tho
[2022-06-01T22:57:17] Gigolo Joe: 16.4 kw single motor
[2022-06-01T22:57:18] Mirono escooters: Hold on.. are there any known Bugs in old fw? Especially with halls?
[2022-06-01T22:57:59] Gigolo Joe: No idea But feels like yes
[2022-06-01T22:58:01] sombre_enfant: Sucé
[2022-06-01T22:58:40] Mirono escooters: I feel like i may be in luck as always
[2022-06-01T22:59:03] Gigolo Joe: If anyone can recompile a working 5.3 version for the 75100v2 without limits, that'd be great
[2022-06-01T22:59:30] Gigolo Joe: 120 phase amp is nothing
[2022-06-01T22:59:45] Gigolo Joe: I NEED MOREEEE POWAAAAAA
[2022-06-01T23:05:55] francois schempers: I receive single Vesc controller that I'll put in a friend's sleeper scooter, any advice ? things to know on those single Vesc one, I know I gotta check if they didn't left solder bids xD
[2022-06-01T23:06:47] Mirono escooters: Make sure casing isnt slicing in phase wires like here, edges were sharp And see it makes good thermal contact And solder balls
[2022-06-01T23:06:48] Gigolo Joe: Prepare for high temps if you're on big battery and high amps
[2022-06-01T23:07:50] francois schempers: 16S and like 30A max ill compensate with phase Amps so yeah I'll have some preps to do for thermals ^^
[2022-06-01T23:08:27] Mirono escooters: Thats not much, dont think much overheatibg happens
[2022-06-01T23:08:39] Mirono escooters: Ps, if goes inside xiaomi, u can use xiaomi ble with vrsc now!
[2022-06-01T23:09:08] francois schempers: it will if I ask a big phase Amps from low battery Amps ^^
[2022-06-01T23:09:30] Mirono escooters: True
[2022-06-01T23:09:36] francois schempers: oh that's cool ! I'll definitely look into that,you have some links for me ?
[2022-06-01T23:09:38] Mirono escooters: Bolt it down, u shall be fine
[2022-06-01T23:09:48] Mirono escooters: Uh, ill search my endless telegram
[2022-06-01T23:10:04] francois schempers: <sticker>
[2022-06-01T23:12:41] Happy Giraffe: If you bolt it to frame with paste, turn it upside down
[2022-06-01T23:13:06] Happy Giraffe: Mosfet contact the fan (upper) side of case
[2022-06-01T23:13:38] francois schempers: I was gonna open it anyway, but that's good advice ^^ it's the spinted one
[2022-06-01T23:14:38] Happy Giraffe: Case splits in half so bottom part thermally useless
[2022-06-01T23:15:03] francois schempers: I'll sand of the paint and work on it until I get a mirror polish finish, same in the frame, then a bit of thermal paste, can't get much better than that ^^
[2022-06-01T23:16:20] Happy Giraffe: You can try to grind top side smoother
[2022-06-01T23:16:51] francois schempers: an fill the radiator with copper to have a bigger contact area 👌
[2022-06-01T23:16:59] Happy Giraffe: But cant do much more, its retard design but still surprisingly handles 50A batt 130A phase without any cooling for me😅
[2022-06-01T23:17:20] Happy Giraffe: Nothing like that really needed
[2022-06-01T23:17:47] Happy Giraffe: 30A batt and 100A phase is ok with no cooling at all
[2022-06-01T23:18:00] francois schempers: yeah it'll be fine, I'm just futurproofing the thing, because I know my friend, they are like me x)
[2022-06-01T23:18:24] Happy Giraffe: I ran 150A phase on mine haha, doesnt even have paste...
[2022-06-01T23:18:58] Happy Giraffe: But just bolting topside to frame with paste will do nicely
[2022-06-01T23:19:12] francois schempers: I'll keep you guys updated, better doing it right 💪
[2022-06-01T23:19:49] Happy Giraffe: Lets see, hardware limit comes first tho. Or make custom copper topside😳
[2022-06-01T23:20:16] Mirono escooters: 🥵
[2022-06-01T23:20:16] Happy Giraffe: Mosfets are not on same level, thats an issue there. Like 2mm different height
[2022-06-01T23:20:19] francois schempers: you guys know how much of a beating can take the m365 Pro motor ? I think its the next weak point in the build
[2022-06-01T23:20:31] Mirono escooters: 1500w max, my tests
[2022-06-01T23:20:35] Happy Giraffe: Lol, it will melt at 100A phase
[2022-06-01T23:20:37] Mirono escooters: Install temp sensor, add ferrofluid
[2022-06-01T23:21:04] Happy Giraffe: Wattage is irrelevant as you can run 72v 20A vs 36v40A and latter will cook it
[2022-06-01T23:21:16] Mirono escooters: Sorry, on 15s
[2022-06-01T23:21:18] Gigolo Joe: And drill holes 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
[2022-06-01T23:21:37] Mirono escooters: Oh later 2800w, 20s, but that maybe cooked it. Idk. Not my fault. Kuch
[2022-06-01T23:21:44] francois schempers: I have installed ferrofluild, hopes it will be enough x)
[2022-06-01T23:22:09] Happy Giraffe: Some 30A bat 100A phase is about max I think
[2022-06-01T23:22:16] Mirono escooters: Test and see
[2022-06-01T23:22:24] francois schempers: on 16s I think too
[2022-06-01T23:22:30] Mirono escooters: If you can cook egg on it, push abit more and tjen stop
[2022-06-01T23:22:34] Happy Giraffe: Even 80A phase is lot for xiaomi😅
[2022-06-01T23:23:04] Happy Giraffe: If putting your dick to the windings burns you have gone too far I would say
[2022-06-01T23:23:40] Happy Giraffe: Need a temp sensor to know what happens inside motor
[2022-06-01T23:23:42] Mirono escooters: Dont put your fingers where you wouldn't put your dick
[2022-06-01T23:23:46] Mirono escooters: Best sticker ever
[2022-06-01T23:24:04] francois schempers: yeah but one thing to note, xiaomi controller are hall sensored but with a shitty hard coded FOC, I think it will run cooler on a proper detected Vesc FOC
[2022-06-01T23:24:05] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-06-01T23:24:32] Happy Giraffe: Put a temp sensor in😳
[2022-06-01T23:24:45] Mirono escooters: Defenitely! But still, theres a limit for those 35mm magnets and small winding core
[2022-06-01T23:24:57] Happy Giraffe: Then easy rollback when windings 100°c
[2022-06-01T23:25:21] francois schempers: <photos/photo_4578@01-06-2022_23-25-21.jpg>
[2022-06-01T23:25:22] francois schempers: oh boy I know x)
[2022-06-01T23:25:34] Mirono escooters: I wonder what my motor inside is doing, but i believe wibdings are ok. Got temp sensor, just need hook up
[2022-06-01T23:25:39] francois schempers: look mine was a bit cooked here xD
[2022-06-01T23:25:41] Mirono escooters: Mother of all motors
[2022-06-01T23:25:51] Mirono escooters: If it rides..
[2022-06-01T23:26:21] francois schempers: <photos/photo_4579@01-06-2022_23-26-21.jpg>
[2022-06-01T23:27:18] Mirono escooters: Nice job
[2022-06-01T23:29:15] francois schempers: was a different time ^^
[2022-06-01T23:29:45] Mirono escooters: Oh, 1 thing i didnt try.. make cables in 1 2 3 sequence Although i dont believe i that i will try it tomorrow😂
[2022-06-01T23:31:47] Mirono escooters: Oh and update. I never did that, but how hard can it be
[2022-06-01T23:32:03] Mirono escooters: If i dont accidentally enable phase philtering..
[2022-06-01T23:33:32] francois schempers: you means changing the phase order ?
[2022-06-01T23:33:51] Mirono escooters: No, i hooked up halls in 2 3 1 sequence
[2022-06-01T23:33:52] francois schempers: <photos/photo_4580@01-06-2022_23-33-52.jpg>
[2022-06-01T23:34:12] francois schempers: oh okey
[2022-06-01T23:34:15] Mirono escooters: Long story. I. my brain, vesc wouldn't have problem And i thougt i read it somewhere
[2022-06-01T23:34:26] Mirono escooters: Its just desperate trying to not need to ope. A motor
[2022-06-02T08:02:03] Mirono escooters: You can use the Lisp script for xiaomi display from here, but you will need to use 6.0 vesc fw for the lisp feature.
[2022-06-02T08:02:11] Mirono escooters: Here you can change the calibration. To get throttle and brake values in the 0.0 - 1.0 range https://github.com/vedderb/vesc_tool/blob/f03d167320bed212f56b49ad6b33716943a9472c/res/Lisp/Examples/m365_dash.lisp#L6-L11
[2022-06-02T08:02:20] Mirono escooters: https://github.com/m365fw/vesc_tool/pull/1 This is what I am on right now. When I am done I will PR it to the VESC tool repo.
[2022-06-02T08:02:23] Mirono escooters: @francois_schempers
[2022-06-02T12:18:52] francois schempers: tks 👌
[2022-06-02T13:24:33] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_4581@02-06-2022_13-24-33.jpg>
[2022-06-02T13:24:34] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2022-06-02T13:24:40] Mirono escooters: Fw 5.01 Max 45a
[2022-06-02T13:24:48] Mirono escooters: 5.03 Yea 285a ur good
[2022-06-02T13:25:05] Face de Pin Sucé: 1.23mohm 😂
[2022-06-02T13:25:21] Face de Pin Sucé: Run it again, it fucked somewhere x)
[2022-06-02T13:26:16] Mirono escooters: Sure?
[2022-06-02T13:26:23] Mirono escooters: This is after new fw 5.03
[2022-06-02T13:26:40] Кирилл: +
[2022-06-02T13:26:46] Mirono escooters: Does the valuez matter for ridibg, or juzt informative
[2022-06-02T13:26:49] Mirono escooters: Ill do again
[2022-06-02T13:27:55] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_4582@02-06-2022_13-27-55.jpg>
[2022-06-02T13:27:56] Mirono escooters: Uhm
[2022-06-02T13:28:10] Mirono escooters: Same
[2022-06-02T13:29:23] Face de Pin Sucé: Weird
[2022-06-02T13:31:06] Mirono escooters: When i give low throttle.. halls work, it has torque
[2022-06-02T13:31:14] Mirono escooters: But if i give full.. listen😨
[2022-06-02T13:31:29] Mirono escooters: <video_file>
[2022-06-02T13:47:45] Happy Giraffe: Superconductors unlocked
[2022-06-02T13:49:44] Mirono escooters: Must b misreading
[2022-06-02T13:49:59] Mirono escooters: I go solder cable 123, if that doesnt work i lose mind
[2022-06-02T13:50:29] Mirono escooters: Vesc needs correct poles and wheel dia only for speed reas right
[2022-06-02T14:04:48] Happy Giraffe: No need
[2022-06-02T14:05:03] Happy Giraffe: A properly soldered copper connector is enough
[2022-06-02T14:06:26] Mirono escooters: I mean..
[2022-06-02T14:06:27] Mirono escooters: 123 order phase
[2022-06-02T14:07:14] Happy Giraffe: Phase and vesc doesnt matter
[2022-06-02T14:07:31] Happy Giraffe: Automatic, just need to pick up correct spin direction
[2022-06-02T14:11:37] Mirono escooters: Yes. Thats what i thougt
[2022-06-02T14:11:40] Mirono escooters: But im desperate
[2022-06-02T14:15:47] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_4583@02-06-2022_14-15-47.jpg>
[2022-06-02T14:15:50] Mirono escooters: Normal values..
[2022-06-02T14:17:20] Mirono escooters: Its .. fixed.
[2022-06-02T14:17:29] Mirono escooters: It was the hall sequence fault..
[2022-06-02T14:21:53] Mirono escooters: God knows why but it works and i am happy
[2022-06-02T14:30:21] Paolo ⁭: 1.18mR no more an resistance 😂 no magnetic power xd
[2022-06-02T14:30:30] Paolo ⁭: What means?
[2022-06-02T14:30:43] Mirono escooters: So halls i connected like this: 2 1 3
[2022-06-02T14:30:47] Mirono escooters: It didnt like it
[2022-06-02T14:30:51] Mirono escooters: Now i did 1 2 3
[2022-06-02T14:30:53] Mirono escooters: Works Fine
[2022-06-02T14:30:57] Mirono escooters: God knows why
[2022-06-02T14:31:09] Mirono escooters: When i throttled too much it would just vibrate
[2022-06-02T14:31:24] Paolo ⁭: Vesc haven’t auto detection?☹️
[2022-06-02T14:31:39] Mirono escooters: I did do auto detection
[2022-06-02T14:31:46] Mirono escooters: And it worked. Kinda. Low throttle .
[2022-06-02T14:32:01] Mirono escooters: I guess its so simply coded it expected hall 3 to switch before 1..
[2022-06-02T17:14:24] sombre_enfant: Two more🥷🏾
[2022-06-02T17:21:54] Mirono escooters: 😩
[2022-06-02T17:22:09] Mirono escooters: I need a project for one, soon.
[2022-06-02T17:53:29] Happy Giraffe: Perfect one project first🌚
[2022-06-02T17:54:16] Happy Giraffe: My scooter was bit of a diy learning process so Ebike will be sleek and tidy. Its also good for reliability and servicing to have everything nicely covered and hooked up
[2022-06-02T18:12:20] Mirono escooters: Ssshhhttttttt
[2022-06-02T18:20:29] Mirono escooters: Im not good at perfecting details, thats gf work
[2022-06-02T18:20:37] Mirono escooters: I do the rough work
[2022-06-02T18:21:04] Mirono escooters: Ebike i will finish good, my alieexpress order list is way to big
[2022-06-02T21:16:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You build in a way of music 😎
[2022-06-02T21:45:07] Kevin: is it possible to connect 2 Enertion Focbox and one Focbox Unity to all work together?
[2022-06-02T21:48:59] Happy Giraffe: And I completed my last challenge "get attention from police"😂
[2022-06-02T21:49:28] Happy Giraffe: Nobody here has Unity afaik so we are not really sure. Most run Spintend Ubox
[2022-06-02T21:49:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the first 2 focbox on a single motor ?
[2022-06-02T21:49:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1
[2022-06-02T21:50:21] Happy Giraffe: But there are smart guys here so the group is full of surprises😁
[2022-06-02T21:50:38] Kevin: the first 2 single ones will be wired to one motor each and the unity will be wired to 2 motors so in total they will run 4 motors
[2022-06-02T21:50:41] Kevin: its for an esk8
[2022-06-02T21:50:51] Kevin: but im not sure if you can configure it that way?
[2022-06-02T21:51:06] Kevin: like so that the 2 single focboxes can work with the dual one
[2022-06-02T21:51:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not sure it will work with another additionnal vesc. in vesc code, the 2 cores // usage for a single motor is really weird.
[2022-06-02T21:52:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i've never seen any new vesc design supporting this feature
[2022-06-02T21:53:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's a shame, you can quickly double mosfets 😁
[2022-06-02T21:54:01] Kevin: Alright, thanks alot tho
[2022-06-02T22:00:23] Oliver Eliasson: @koxx3 i think he means 1 controller per motor: 2 single vesc for two motors and then unity for other two. Cant you connect all woth can?
[2022-06-02T22:01:47] Kevin: yeah, that's what i mean
[2022-06-02T22:02:28] Happy Giraffe: Then one master vesc would just control the others in Canbus no?🤔
[2022-06-02T22:11:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if you don't use the // feature of unity, i don't see any issue
[2022-06-02T22:13:58] sombre_enfant: Wait do you mean its possible to run two vesc per motor that easy ?
[2022-06-02T22:14:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_4585@02-06-2022_22-14-05.jpg>
[2022-06-02T22:14:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes
[2022-06-02T22:14:16] sombre_enfant: Tf
[2022-06-02T22:14:28] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2022-06-02T22:14:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but need to be with a single stm32
[2022-06-02T22:14:44] sombre_enfant: Ah i see
[2022-06-02T22:15:02] sombre_enfant: Then it dont work with two single
[2022-06-02T22:15:05] Happy Giraffe: You can upload also uncompressed image for higher quality👍
[2022-06-02T22:15:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: focbox had a really intersting design
[2022-06-02T22:15:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: found here : https://massivestator.com/products/focbox-unity-dual-motor-controller
[2022-06-02T22:16:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no
[2022-06-02T22:16:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: needs perfectly synced mosfet control. it can't be acheive by can bus.
[2022-06-02T22:17:15] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_4586@02-06-2022_22-17-15.jpg>
[2022-06-02T22:19:22] sombre_enfant: Do the fesc75100 mosfet driver are good ? The design is easy should be possible to double the mosfet
[2022-06-02T22:48:30] Paolo ⁭: It’s the cheapest and more available driver with good current, should be ok but resistor should be modded
[2022-06-02T22:50:35] sombre_enfant: Ah fuck i dont know ohm law and stuff
[2022-06-02T23:27:46] Mirono escooters: Magura mt5e, best source?
[2022-06-02T23:28:07] Mirono escooters: My brakes rn arent likibg 60kmh wear pads quick and they act wzird
[2022-06-02T23:32:14] Happy Giraffe: Find eu warehouse with cheapest price but be sure to double check you get alu lever and the switch (NO)
[2022-06-02T23:44:44] Paolo ⁭: I sell 190€ the pair 🐣
[2022-06-02T23:45:03] Mirono escooters: Rear mt5e worthless i bet
[2022-06-02T23:45:31] Paolo ⁭: @roscheeee rear mt8 was on smoke xd
[2022-06-02T23:45:32] Happy Giraffe: I got mine new 89.90€
[2022-06-02T23:45:36] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-06-02T23:45:50] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-06-02T23:49:31] Happy Giraffe: Have you guys thought about using dual disc in front?
[2022-06-02T23:49:55] Happy Giraffe: Heat shared for two discs, there are Y- adapters that make it possible
[2022-06-02T23:50:26] Mirono escooters: I suggested suce that
[2022-06-02T23:57:47] Happy Giraffe: Hard to put the other disc in tho, always need to take phase connectors out
[2022-06-02T23:58:15] Mirono escooters: Bought a trail kit, best option
[2022-06-02T23:58:20] Mirono escooters: Alrrady overkill for my weight
[2022-06-03T00:03:19] Happy Giraffe: Trail kit?
[2022-06-03T00:03:31] Happy Giraffe: Wtf is that?😳
[2022-06-03T00:04:14] Mirono escooters: Front mt5
[2022-06-03T00:04:19] Mirono escooters: Rear 2 piston brake
[2022-06-03T00:04:32] Mirono escooters: Mt trail kit
[2022-06-03T00:10:45] Unknown: I was looking at those but decided on mt5 all around. Basically mt5/7 caliper for front and mt4/8 caliper for rear. Really decent prices for the Mt trails
[2022-06-03T00:11:18] Mirono escooters: I dont know, i will lock rear wheel 100% with 203mm 2 piston alrrady 😂😂
[2022-06-03T00:12:27] Unknown: Oh yea for sure. The quad piston calipers are simply larger and dissipate heat better due to simple mass. Shouldn't be an issue on the rear as much as the front .. hence the Mt trail idea
[2022-06-03T00:12:43] Mirono escooters: True
[2022-06-03T00:13:05] Mirono escooters: My 40€ alieexpress kit did good, but i really needed something better
[2022-06-03T00:13:09] Mirono escooters: 😂
[2022-06-03T00:13:33] Mirono escooters: Was it dumb to not get mt5 all around ?
[2022-06-03T00:14:20] Unknown: Haha. Yea, I mean most brakes will lock the tire if you crank on them hard enough. Better brakes usually have better modulation and better heat dissipation... Plus more rigid calipers and levers for less spongy feel
[2022-06-03T00:14:42] Unknown: I think the trails will be just fine man.
[2022-06-03T00:14:46] Mirono escooters: Now im in doubt
[2022-06-03T00:14:54] Mirono escooters: 🙈😅
[2022-06-03T00:15:11] Mirono escooters: Okidoki. I stay with that. I should stop thinking, adhd is fun
[2022-06-03T00:15:26] Unknown: The quad calipers are literally almost twice the mass of the dual... The trails aren't that much cheaper than full mt5 quad pistons all around...
[2022-06-03T00:15:27] Mirono escooters: If 40€ alieexpress locks it.. i mean🙈
[2022-06-03T00:15:54] Mirono escooters: Yes, i juzt saw price diff after, its nothing
[2022-06-03T00:17:10] Unknown: But having said that, I think they will be perfectly fine. Really depends how you ride and how hard you are on them. Also some guys use front brake more than rear and other way around. I tend to be harder on my rear than my front which is why I didn't go for the trails. Plus buying 2 different types of pads just seemed like a hassle lol
[2022-06-03T00:18:17] Mirono escooters: I use front alot
[2022-06-03T00:18:19] Mirono escooters: Feels better
[2022-06-03T00:18:20] Unknown: I just use my rears more often, so by default I'm harder on them. Really only use front brakes when I need to stop faster than rears alone
[2022-06-03T00:18:43] Mirono escooters: I will order mt5 for front and back. Better idea, less hassle, no worryinf
[2022-06-03T00:18:51] Unknown: Yea, all preference.
[2022-06-03T00:19:14] Unknown: The mt5 HC edition are sweet with the 1 finger levers. I went for them
[2022-06-03T00:19:22] Mirono escooters: I dont like 1 finger lever
[2022-06-03T00:19:31] Mirono escooters: Im the type of guy bigger lever better
[2022-06-03T00:19:31] Unknown: I would just make sure you get the aluminum levers
[2022-06-03T00:19:38] Mirono escooters: Got that
[2022-06-03T00:19:45] Mirono escooters: Wicj other options is there
[2022-06-03T00:19:52] Unknown: Good good. Then 1,2,3 finger type is all preference
[2022-06-03T00:20:05] Mirono escooters: 2 or 3, for me
[2022-06-03T00:20:06] Unknown: The molded plastic levers
[2022-06-03T00:20:12] Mirono escooters: Ieiw
[2022-06-03T00:20:38] Unknown: Yea... Each version is a bit different so just make sure you know which lever it comes with before you buy
[2022-06-03T00:20:44] Mirono escooters: Alu
[2022-06-03T00:21:03] Mirono escooters: 2meter hose cable, says Easy to cut Oh boy i doubt myself
[2022-06-03T00:21:31] Unknown: Haha.. I was thinking the same. Not really wanting to buy a special hose cutter that I'll use once
[2022-06-03T00:21:49] Mirono escooters: Ill pass by a bike shop
[2022-06-03T00:21:55] Mirono escooters: I have bleedk its but no cutter
[2022-06-03T00:22:14] Mirono escooters: 2 meter.. 1 i just wrapped around front fork, but 2..😅😅
[2022-06-03T00:22:22] Unknown: Yea good thinking. Same here
[2022-06-03T00:22:59] Unknown: Hah.. yea lil long for front. Have spaghetti lines 🍝
[2022-06-03T00:30:01] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, alu lever or plastic?
[2022-06-03T00:30:51] Happy Giraffe: But its also each individual piston getting their "edge" on the disc and individual placement
[2022-06-03T00:31:10] Happy Giraffe: Same effect as two wide pads vs 4 small ones I think
[2022-06-03T00:31:44] Happy Giraffe: But why not get mt5e with sensor for cutting motor power?😳
[2022-06-03T00:48:01] Unknown: I've read that most prefer the 4 individual pads rather than the 2 larger pads on the mt5 and/or mt7. Mt7 versions only come stock with 4 pad setups and mt7 are supposed to be the more "pro" version
[2022-06-03T00:49:32] Unknown: I personally didn't go for the mt5e with sensor because I use ebrake on a separate dedicated lever for variable e-brake/Regen. Also allowed me to use the HC 1 finger levers which aren't available with the sensor. Minoro might benefit from the built in sensor depending on his setup
[2022-06-03T00:49:54] Unknown: Also the only mt5e version I could find in the USA was the 3 finger plastic lever version
[2022-06-03T01:19:12] Happy Giraffe: Spintend adc board mk.2 has 2-wire cutoff and variable regen in one package😁
[2022-06-03T01:19:19] Happy Giraffe: Thats gay
[2022-06-03T01:38:58] Unknown: I know lol. I helped a friend try n track down an aluminum lever with sensor and couldn't find them anywhere in 2 or 3 finger. Only plastic lever with sensor 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-06-03T01:41:08] Happy Giraffe: Magura also sells the Bosh ABS ebike brakes, similar to MT5 I think but all aluminium construction
[2022-06-03T01:41:22] Happy Giraffe: You don't have to use the abs feature
[2022-06-03T06:58:35] francois schempers: or you can go all motor break like I did, and bet on your death every event that happen on the road 🤣🤣
[2022-06-03T08:25:24] Mirono escooters: Alu
[2022-06-03T08:26:17] Mirono escooters: Same, haha
[2022-06-03T10:37:31] Happy Giraffe: Lol
[2022-06-03T18:47:00] Artem Bulashev: Do not use 5.3 on Ubox! That fw burns Ubox for some reason, doesn’t happen on 5.2
[2022-06-03T18:47:15] Artem Bulashev: Ubox even warn about it on all their web pages
[2022-06-03T18:47:38] Artem Bulashev: 5.2 doesn’t have a single case of such burn out that people got on 5.3
[2022-06-03T18:47:54] Artem Bulashev: They are working on singling out the issue cause but it is not clear yet

[2022-06-03T19:38:35] Кирилл: But spintend also using 5.3 in their blog on website🤔
[2022-06-03T19:38:49] Кирилл: In examples
[2022-06-03T19:39:41] Кирилл: Need to use only 3.01 vesc tool with 5.3. 3.00 doesnt work with 5.3 fw
[2022-06-03T19:39:57] Кирилл: Phase filters mb?
[2022-06-03T19:42:14] Oliver Eliasson: My ubox came with 5.3 and works great (for now) do i need to downdate to 5.2 to be secure?
[2022-06-03T20:03:42] Gigolo Joe: On this one?
[2022-06-03T20:56:09] Artem Bulashev: Be wise low amp power
[2022-06-03T20:56:48] Artem Bulashev: Looks like it is ubox Hw incompatibility with new current measuring technique in 5.3
[2022-06-03T20:57:06] rosheee: yes
[2022-06-03T20:57:07] rosheee: i toldu how to

[2022-06-03T20:57:22] Artem Bulashev: I suspect it over delivers current (more than you set)
[2022-06-03T20:57:36] Artem Bulashev: What is this
[2022-06-03T20:57:41] Artem Bulashev: May be I missed it

[2022-06-03T21:56:59] Happy Giraffe: I run a test for 150A phase on single, if it overdelivered I think it should have smoked already
[2022-06-03T21:57:29] rosheee: never had burn

[2022-06-04T00:08:11] rosheee: here u see
[2022-06-04T00:08:20] Unknown: Also need make sure any aftermarket brake hose will fit your particular banjo outlet
[2022-06-04T00:08:29] rosheee: 1st no pr essure
[2022-06-04T00:08:35] rosheee: 2nd with pressure normal one and 3rd with pressure stahlflex

[2022-06-04T00:09:33] rosheee: then i leave instantly
[2022-06-04T00:09:35] Unknown: How do you know they'll fit Magura, Shimano, hope, etc... Banjo outlet?
[2022-06-04T00:09:42] rosheee: my local bikeshop sells them
[2022-06-04T00:09:48] rosheee: that is why
[2022-06-04T00:09:49] Unknown: Hose ID needs to be specific to each banjo
[2022-06-04T00:09:52] rosheee: rofl ^^'
[2022-06-04T00:10:11] rosheee: he gave me for shimano
[2022-06-04T00:10:16] rosheee: i use with magura
[2022-06-04T00:10:23] rosheee: it is bit thicker
[2022-06-04T00:10:26] Unknown: Rfol nothing bro. A Magura banjo isn't the same as a Shimano or Hope banjo. The line ID needs to match the banjo out OD
[2022-06-04T00:10:27] rosheee: he uses it on all his ebikes
[2022-06-04T00:10:41] Mirono escooters: Is crampe
[2022-06-04T00:10:43] rosheee: ^^' there are for magura, hope, sram...for evewrytone
[2022-06-04T00:10:53] rosheee: for all manufac.

[2022-06-04T00:17:49] Mirko Boni: Hello everyone, an information, but if I install a single motor vsett 10 with 38A of battery in the ninebot G30, how is the motor?
[2022-06-04T00:18:14] Mirono escooters: Me with xtech 😩
[2022-06-04T00:18:29] Mirono escooters: Or 40€ ali brakes Just discovered its 1 piston, not even 2 haha
[2022-06-04T00:18:51] Mirono escooters: Itb will be happy
[2022-06-04T00:19:03] Mirko Boni: Now I have an 800w motor and I reach 57 km / h on a flat road!
[2022-06-04T00:19:26] Mirko Boni: Thank you!
[2022-06-04T00:19:26] Paolo ⁭: Problem isn’t too the motor, controller is your actual limit
[2022-06-04T00:19:37] Mirono escooters: Speed and W dont have much coorelation
[2022-06-04T00:19:42] Mirko Boni: Ciao Paolo!
[2022-06-04T00:19:45] Mirono escooters: Higher w does not equal more speed
[2022-06-04T00:19:53] Paolo ⁭: Get a vesc and discover new world
[2022-06-04T00:20:00] Paolo ⁭: Or nucular
[2022-06-04T00:20:01] Mirko Boni: Watt 2300
[2022-06-04T00:21:54] Mirko Boni: <video_file>
[2022-06-04T00:23:56] Mirko Boni: I don't have the right preparation to install vesc!
[2022-06-04T00:24:12] Paolo ⁭: It’s pretty easy
[2022-06-04T00:24:56] Mirko Boni: But the colors of the phases? Hall sensors?
[2022-06-04T00:25:07] Paolo ⁭: Auto detection 😉
[2022-06-04T00:25:23] Mirko Boni: Wow! Incredible
[2022-06-04T00:25:37] Paolo ⁭: Get another motor , buy a ubox 75/200 , then fly
[2022-06-04T00:25:53] Mirko Boni: Single motor?
[2022-06-04T00:26:19] Paolo ⁭: Dual motor
[2022-06-04T00:26:24] Paolo ⁭: Much better dual motor
[2022-06-04T00:26:37] Mirono escooters: Single is already very good, haha
[2022-06-04T00:26:40] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse dual better
[2022-06-04T00:26:45] Mirono escooters: If u shit money😇
[2022-06-04T00:26:46] Paolo ⁭: Single motor goes always stressed
[2022-06-04T00:26:57] Mirono escooters: Let it sweat
[2022-06-04T00:27:35] Paolo ⁭: My Ducati (xiaomi clone) can reach over 100kmh in single motor with flipsky and 18s battery
[2022-06-04T00:27:41] Mirko Boni: The problem is that I have no head to start doing a dual motor! I don't really want to go crazy!
[2022-06-04T00:28:05] Mirko Boni: Wonderful
[2022-06-04T00:29:18] Mirono escooters: Poor frame
[2022-06-04T00:29:22] Mirono escooters: Single is good enough. Progress while u gain more knowledge
[2022-06-04T00:29:24] Mirono escooters: Dont rush it😀
[2022-06-04T00:29:52] Mirko Boni: Thank you Mirono!
[2022-06-04T00:30:08] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2022-06-04T00:30:47] Paolo ⁭: Anyway stock battery no good for these performance
[2022-06-04T00:31:11] Mirono escooters: Indeed
[2022-06-04T00:32:29] Mirko Boni: But I have to make a new internal battery! I'm doing a project!
[2022-06-04T00:32:47] Mirono escooters: Good luck soldier
[2022-06-04T00:33:21] Mirono escooters: If we can help, ;)
[2022-06-04T00:34:18] Paolo ⁭: Then I tell you : 17s6p battery (50E/50g/48x/m50lt or similar cells) 1200w blade motor Flipsky controller vesc or similar
[2022-06-04T00:34:22] Mirko Boni: Thanks! I want to make a LG 21700 10S 24A battery
[2022-06-04T00:35:12] Mirko Boni: Externally I have a new 6S from 24A Samsung cells
[2022-06-04T00:35:39] Paolo ⁭: A or Ah? Not same thing
[2022-06-04T00:35:52] Mirko Boni: Ah
[2022-06-04T00:36:01] Mirko Boni: Daiii non fare il preciso ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
[2022-06-04T00:36:38] Paolo ⁭: Non è questione di fare preciso ma son due cose completamente diverse , se no non capisco
[2022-06-04T00:36:59] Mirko Boni: Hai ragione, ma tu sai cosa intendevo
[2022-06-04T00:37:52] Paolo ⁭: Solitamente qui classifichiamo batterie per A corrente di scarica, la mia eroga 280A ad esempio
[2022-06-04T00:40:45] Mirko Boni: Paolo non son bravo a fare questi calcoli mi spiace!
[2022-06-04T00:48:21] Happy Giraffe: This
[2022-06-04T00:48:58] Happy Giraffe: Motor becomes just inefficient wasting the amps as heat, the more it heats up the shittier it gets
[2022-06-04T01:02:39] Mirono escooters: What are the advantages of upgrading phase wires, is it worth the struggle
[2022-06-04T01:02:58] Mirono escooters: Ofc advantage more power through, but maybe i miss smth
[2022-06-04T01:03:15] Mirono escooters: Feel like unnecessarily struggl2
[2022-06-04T01:08:30] Happy Giraffe: You still are bit limited by winding usually
[2022-06-04T01:08:34] Happy Giraffe: Depends
[2022-06-04T09:19:01] Mirono escooters: Ill just keep stock i guess

[2022-06-04T09:21:58] Mirono escooters: Maybe something interesting for the power hungry dudes
[2022-06-04T09:52:48] francois schempers: at this price, you're better of just buying a kelly controller https://kellycontroller.com/shop/kls-8080h/
[2022-06-04T09:53:26] Mirono escooters: True
[2022-06-04T09:54:09] francois schempers: that's my next thing btw, I'm building a moto 👌
[2022-06-04T09:56:24] Mirono escooters: Haha next step for ebike
[2022-06-04T11:47:49] Oliver Eliasson: I think i will uppgrade, easier to just get cable with 6 hall (temp sensor also) then to fit extra wire for tempsensor with existing cable
[2022-06-04T13:58:54] Artem Bulashev: If your current once get hot to touch than you may be losing up to 30% of power at that point
[2022-06-04T14:00:07] Artem Bulashev: I have conducted testing of a motor on stand where 3 phase dc motor was connected through a terminal. It was set to draw up to 45amps
[2022-06-04T14:00:21] Artem Bulashev: In reality I say thrust under performance of 30%
[2022-06-04T14:01:02] Artem Bulashev: I than discovered that motor was using only 70% of current and than discovered interconnection being very hot (burning hot)
[2022-06-04T14:01:51] Artem Bulashev: After after removing that bottle neck I got 1200g of thrust vs 850g before 😄 and proper 43amps
[2022-06-04T14:02:13] Artem Bulashev: So anything that is burning hot = a lot of losses

[2022-06-04T17:25:29] rosheee: Cheap shit
[2022-06-04T17:25:55] Mirono escooters: Remember my hall problem It was way to obvious So, i had torque at low speed now, but i felt vibrations before it switched sensorless, (speed was my guess) I didn't think it switched to sensorless. Brain doodoo So i lowered erpm from 2000 to 1200 Everything ok now..😀
[2022-06-04T17:26:34] Mirono escooters: Cant find datzsheet

[2022-06-04T19:42:30] Face de Pin Sucé: But how did you break it ?
[2022-06-04T19:43:47] Artem Bulashev: Never seen this brand
[2022-06-04T19:45:01] Mirono escooters: Nce? They are widely used
[2022-06-04T19:45:04] Mirono escooters: Rather big brand
[2022-06-04T19:48:44] Artem Bulashev: 🤷‍♂️
[2022-06-04T19:49:00] Mirono escooters: Brand has good mos

[2022-06-05T11:17:18] Mirono escooters: How you burned em
[2022-06-05T11:17:51] Paolo ⁭: I was changing connectors for invert front controller with rear
[2022-06-05T11:18:06] Paolo ⁭: But motor connector and wire position was all reversed
[2022-06-05T11:18:25] Paolo ⁭: Then I put hall connector with reversed polarity in both

[2022-06-05T11:58:43] Mirono escooters: Wonders of technology. Can't wait to see how it processes further
[2022-06-05T11:58:47] Artem Bulashev: 4€ is not bad at all in my book
[2022-06-05T11:59:16] Mirono escooters: I know i know

[2022-06-05T12:03:09] Mirono escooters: For price they are good
[2022-06-05T12:03:15] Mirono escooters: Just double check with a discharge
[2022-06-05T12:35:38] Artem Bulashev: They will be gone in 4 days 4 packs
[2022-06-05T12:35:55] Artem Bulashev: They are brand new already tested

[2022-06-05T12:36:19] Mirono escooters: Wow, wtf
[2022-06-05T12:36:20] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2022-06-05T12:36:32] Mirono escooters: I wish
[2022-06-05T12:40:20] Paolo ⁭: Tesla never sell brand new cells xd, also seller who sell these cells tell you this
[2022-06-05T12:40:50] Artem Bulashev: Yeap

[2022-06-05T17:41:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: check reseller rating... below 95%, i trust no one 😁
[2022-06-05T17:41:31] Mirono escooters: Fair point
[2022-06-05T17:41:46] Mirono escooters: No leds, but all voltages ok Sounss like stm
[2022-06-05T17:41:56] Mirono escooters: How do i try to program wirh st link? I wanted to ask you
[2022-06-05T17:42:16] Mirono escooters: I thibk guy did not destroy but rather brick
[2022-06-05T17:43:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: programming is not really the issue. if it's a fake (gd32, csk32...), it can have different behavior. jens had to make many modifications to port SESC firmware from stm32 to gd32.
[2022-06-05T17:44:04] Mirono escooters: No just a spintend single stock
[2022-06-05T17:44:15] Mirono escooters: Jens is great ps, madlad making xiaomi run vesc
[2022-06-05T17:44:30] Mirono escooters: Can you st link a spintend?
[2022-06-05T17:46:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: of course. all vesc can be flashed with stlink as far as i know
[2022-06-05T17:47:51] Mirono escooters: Can you guide me how? :)
[2022-06-05T17:47:54] Mirono escooters: Or link
[2022-06-05T18:10:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hundreds of tutorial available on google 😁
[2022-06-05T18:16:39] Mirono escooters: Okidoki, my excuses🙈🙃
[2022-06-05T18:16:59] Mirono escooters: I hope there are breakout pins. Lol

[2022-06-06T12:58:32] Artem Bulashev: 75v vesc on 77v battery?
[2022-06-06T12:59:29] Artem Bulashev: Is that this one
[2022-06-06T12:59:34] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2022-06-06T13:04:46] Paolo ⁭: 75100 can support 20s
[2022-06-06T13:25:18] Mirono escooters: Thatz nice
[2022-06-06T15:29:26] Artem Bulashev: That is the question

[2022-06-06T15:41:51] sombre_enfant: La batterie elle tousse carrément
[2022-06-06T15:42:08] Mirono escooters: U know wich?
[2022-06-06T16:05:35] Unknown: Thats where my setup is when I ride hard. Poor Vsett motors on 20s lol. On a speed run with really crazy settings I saw over 100wh/km for that quick drag run 😬. High kv over volted with some good amps. Not the most efficient setup but 43ah battery compensates 🤣
[2022-06-06T16:06:05] sombre_enfant: No
[2022-06-06T16:06:15] Unknown: I'm normally in the 55-70km/wh on my normal settings... Which are still quite high and really fastt

[2022-06-06T18:57:10] Happy Giraffe: Name + fancy box
[2022-06-06T19:01:46] rosheee: Yes
[2022-06-06T19:01:51] rosheee: Saying since long
[2022-06-06T19:01:56] rosheee: But littlefocer cant deliver
[2022-06-06T19:02:00] rosheee: Preordered 6 pcs
[2022-06-06T19:02:15] Mirono escooters: F
[2022-06-06T19:20:41] Unknown: Geez. There's a thread on endless sphere that details the Lil FOCer from original idea and conception to today. Was literally a guy who made a controller. Now his controller is being used by Rion. Pretty cool. Unfortunately it doesn't sound as capable as the Rion name would like us to believe. Hmm
[2022-06-06T19:21:30] Mirono escooters: Roschee confirmed that by testing, lol
[2022-06-06T19:21:41] Mirono escooters: Rion overexcaggerates alot, also batt specs, lol
[2022-06-06T19:25:01] Unknown: Yikes. That ain't cool
[2022-06-06T19:32:06] Mirono escooters: Tried ripping copper sandwich off, came off in 10 pieces. Nice

[2022-06-06T21:23:33] Gigolo Joe: Is that me or it looks really crap for the price u pay for them🤔
[2022-06-06T21:24:34] Artem Bulashev: Yeah hand assembled, not ultrasonic soldering
[2022-06-06T21:25:39] Konstantin: Thanks 🙏. Which driver switch on/off FETs ? Curiosity..
[2022-06-06T21:25:45] Gigolo Joe: I've seen hand assembled ecus (megasquirt) that look way better than that 🤣🤣

[2022-06-07T18:03:06] rosheee: John boiii?
[2022-06-07T18:03:11] Mirono escooters: 100v100a, phase?

[2022-06-07T18:03:20] rosheee: He da boiii
[2022-06-07T18:03:32] Mirono escooters: Ok i absolutely hate the long usb c, prone to break
[2022-06-07T18:03:44] Mirono escooters: 100a phase :( Battery?
[2022-06-07T18:03:54] rosheee: U can pushi pushit
[2022-06-07T18:04:06] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2022-06-07T18:04:06] rosheee: I pushed the 400A outta ubox 100V

[2022-06-07T18:04:36] rosheee: Let us bomb dem fo real telegramination
[2022-06-07T18:07:12] Artem Bulashev: Yeah that’s why Spintend replaced those with flat once
[2022-06-07T18:07:15] Artem Bulashev: So
[2022-06-07T18:07:25] Artem Bulashev: They liked idea of making pcb single side
[2022-06-07T18:07:36] Artem Bulashev: And than cooling entire psb bottom
[2022-06-07T18:09:12] Oliver Eliasson: They should make two casing versions. Standard aluminium and expensive edition out of pure copper. Then @roscheeee would be really happy
[2022-06-07T18:12:58] Mirono escooters: Finally
[2022-06-07T18:13:52] Mirono escooters: Problem is not much would sell, not profitable. If you really go so far as needing pure copper 1: wont buy budget spintend 2: problably have the funds and knowledge to make it
[2022-06-07T18:15:50] rosheee: I had to learn that copper isnt all
[2022-06-07T18:15:56] rosheee: Vaporchamber edition
[2022-06-07T18:16:03] rosheee: Or heatpipe edition
[2022-06-07T18:16:09] Mirono escooters: Next is liquid cool

[2022-06-07T18:16:46] rosheee: So no reao effect
[2022-06-07T18:16:53] rosheee: The vaporchamber is real deal
[2022-06-07T18:17:14] Oliver Eliasson: That would be great.

[2022-06-07T23:33:55] rosheee: i ask spintend
[2022-06-07T23:33:58] Mirono escooters: 0 info even on nce site
[2022-06-07T23:34:01] rosheee: and friend in shenz.
[2022-06-07T23:34:15] Mirono escooters: Ive googled like half an hour
[2022-06-07T23:34:17] Happy Giraffe: Gears wont handle more than 80A
[2022-06-07T23:34:19] Mirono escooters: Tried all typos
[2022-06-07T23:34:26] Mirono escooters: Why get gear then :*
[2022-06-07T23:34:37] Mirono escooters: We wanna see 200a sweat vesc
[2022-06-07T23:35:54] Happy Giraffe: Geared for ebike, lightest unsprung mass on rear wheel. This produces ton of torque even at tiny amps so very efficient with 48v batt. Lastly the motor has round axle and integrated torque arm. As a bonus it has a clutchless planetsry gear so can also do regen
[2022-06-07T23:36:02] Mirono escooters: Idk
[2022-06-07T23:36:18] Mirono escooters: Round??
[2022-06-07T23:36:40] Mirono escooters: I hope
[2022-06-07T23:37:03] Mirono escooters: Its sus that you find 0 info, even on official site
[2022-06-07T23:37:25] Face de Pin Sucé: @roscheeee the thing you can't know is if it's only the fet, or tracks/gate drivers/...
[2022-06-07T23:37:27] Mirono escooters: Problem is we need specs to confirm, if we kill roschee vesc he goes blyat haha
[2022-06-07T23:37:37] Mirono escooters: Worth a try tho!
[2022-06-07T23:37:44] Mirono escooters: No doubt

[2022-06-07T23:56:45] Mirono escooters: 480??
[2022-06-07T23:56:47] Mirono escooters: Wow
[2022-06-07T23:57:09] Mirono escooters: Ps, what is so good about geared Genuinely interested i thought it was from past
[2022-06-07T23:58:11] Paolo ⁭: Just (rion) THRUST😂😂
[2022-06-08T00:01:59] Mirono escooters: It do look like good mos
[2022-06-08T00:04:33] Mirono escooters: Need to be sure they official
[2022-06-08T00:04:46] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂😂

[2022-06-08T00:07:58] rosheee: I BET IT IS @Mr_Star_Delta_Motor and now he sends me a pile of shit directly into ma postbox
[2022-06-08T00:14:18] Happy Giraffe: Most efficient for under 45kmh riding
[2022-06-08T00:15:09] Happy Giraffe: Its lighter, motor runs 5x the rpm of the wheel so its ats it efficient phase rather than a heavy and slow DD motor
[2022-06-08T00:15:28] Mirono escooters: :)
[2022-06-08T00:16:12] Mirono escooters: But gears, noise?
[2022-06-08T00:16:19] Happy Giraffe: Nylon gears, silent
[2022-06-08T00:25:28] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-06-08T00:39:10] Unknown: Is yours the yellow Ferrari or silver Porsche?
[2022-06-08T00:41:10] Unknown: Guys... Does anyone the answer to this question... Or have an opinion...
[2022-06-08T00:43:15] rosheee: Where ferrari
[2022-06-08T00:43:29] rosheee: Silver one gay
[2022-06-08T00:43:47] Unknown: Magura dual piston calipers.. mt5/mt7... On a typical mountain bike the calipers and rotor are on the left side, which puts the Magura "Lip" towards the rear. On my Vsett the calipers and rotors are on the right side, which put that caliper Lip towards the front. Does it matter which way they're mounted? Lip with "Magura" towards the rear or front... Or doesn't matter? I can swap my swingarms and put my calipers/rotors on the left side if needed. Would rather not though lol

[2022-06-08T00:44:40] Кирилл: Mclaren or koenigsegg?
[2022-06-08T00:46:41] Unknown: All Vsett Magura users have the caliper/rotors on the stock right side with the lip facing the front... Is that okay? Or has everyone mounted their brakes backwards? 🤣
[2022-06-08T01:02:17] Happy Giraffe: Vsett = australia
[2022-06-08T01:05:04] Unknown: Backwards? 🤣
[2022-06-08T01:30:08] Happy Giraffe: Upside down backwards kangaroo
[2022-06-08T01:33:46] Unknown: So does it matter regarding the Maguras?? Printed lip to rear is standard on bikes. Printed lip to front ok??
[2022-06-08T01:34:46] Happy Giraffe: Hard to say for sure, you could ask magura themselves. Customer support replies fast
[2022-06-08T01:35:10] rosheee: Heat maybe
[2022-06-08T01:35:19] rosheee: Magura says dude wtf
[2022-06-08T01:35:42] rosheee: Cryptoguys mclaren
[2022-06-08T01:35:45] Unknown: Haha. They definitely do say that
[2022-06-08T01:36:03] rosheee: Alao cuz u modded it they deny
[2022-06-08T01:36:06] Unknown: Found a winning combo for the banjo swap
[2022-06-08T01:36:19] Unknown: I don't care about warranty. I just want them to work as intended
[2022-06-08T01:36:42] rosheee: I think..just cuz i had smoking mt7 and 8 .that ..
[2022-06-08T01:37:00] rosheee: Heat
[2022-06-08T01:37:21] Unknown: Hmm.. I remember.. but hard to say why that happened I think
[2022-06-08T01:37:37] rosheee: What now? Smoke?
[2022-06-08T01:37:40] Unknown: Does the lip block air flow?
[2022-06-08T01:38:05] rosheee: Talk about tomorrow teh pls need jr advice and also sombres and other badassmofos
[2022-06-08T01:38:18] Unknown: Yea your smoking pads lol
[2022-06-08T01:38:39] rosheee: The oil was btw hot as well
[2022-06-08T01:39:00] Unknown: I believe it... Whole shit was burning hot
[2022-06-08T01:39:19] rosheee: But hmm..
[2022-06-08T01:39:52] Rowan Ross: <photos/photo_4661@08-06-2022_01-39-52.jpg>
[2022-06-08T01:39:55] Unknown: Yea... I'm "hmmm ing" too lol
[2022-06-08T01:40:25] rosheee: Maybe lip blocks and the cable gets the heat from pads
[2022-06-08T01:40:44] Unknown: Yea possibly...
[2022-06-08T01:41:08] Unknown: Besides heat... I wonder if there are any mechanical issues mounting with the lip forward
[2022-06-08T01:41:26] rosheee: True
[2022-06-08T01:41:53] rosheee: I think yes
[2022-06-08T01:42:01] Unknown: Like are they designed to only work in one certain direction? Or does it not really affect performance? I dunno 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-06-08T01:42:15] rosheee: Rear less material?
[2022-06-08T01:42:27] rosheee: Your front now more material
[2022-06-08T01:42:53] Unknown: Yes... Opposite the "Magura lip" is less material which would face forward on a normal mountain bike setup with calipers on left
[2022-06-08T01:42:54] rosheee: But idk how hard u ride
[2022-06-08T01:43:00] Unknown: Yes exactly
[2022-06-08T01:43:18] rosheee: <photos/photo_4662@08-06-2022_01-43-18.jpg>
[2022-06-08T01:43:21] Unknown: I ride hard but don't really brake hard often since I live in the country (not a city)
[2022-06-08T01:43:32] Unknown: Yup, lip always faces rear
[2022-06-08T01:43:36] Unknown: On bikes
[2022-06-08T01:43:52] rosheee: Bjt u can see
[2022-06-08T01:44:13] rosheee: <photos/photo_4663@08-06-2022_01-44-13.jpg>
[2022-06-08T01:44:26] rosheee: Now u have fridge aerodynamic
[2022-06-08T01:44:51] Unknown: Yes... Better cooling almost definitely
[2022-06-08T01:45:14] rosheee: U know what
[2022-06-08T01:45:20] rosheee: XD change swingarms
[2022-06-08T01:45:22] Unknown: I can swap my swingarms and put rotors/calipers on the left side. Then lip will face rear. Just didn't want to do that if not necessary
[2022-06-08T01:45:23] rosheee: Pls
[2022-06-08T01:46:01] rosheee: How many chabged them?
[2022-06-08T01:46:22] rosheee: Then u have content for reddit, vsett chat, special and +10cm
[2022-06-08T01:46:53] rosheee: And rly would like to see How maNy done that? And u can go 118kmh+ so better stay safe
[2022-06-08T01:46:57] Unknown: Then I have to re-route motor wires and all... It's doable but definitely a pain
[2022-06-08T01:47:12] rosheee: Word
[2022-06-08T01:47:23] rosheee: Btw never seen your cablew0rk
[2022-06-08T01:47:24] Unknown: I have seen no Vsett switched to left side. All run Maguras on stock right side
[2022-06-08T01:47:31] rosheee: U see
[2022-06-08T01:47:40] Unknown: It's not too bad at all... Just time consuming
[2022-06-08T01:47:45] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-06-08T01:48:15] rosheee: This shit gonna be pain in the ass 300
[2022-06-08T01:48:24] rosheee: This is why we customize
[2022-06-08T01:48:33] rosheee: And i think when u switch
[2022-06-08T01:48:50] rosheee: U could use stock hole for banjo
[2022-06-08T01:48:58] rosheee: Not illegal swap
[2022-06-08T01:49:10] Unknown: I tried dry fitting!!! Doesn't work still 🙈 banjo swap still needed
[2022-06-08T01:49:24] Unknown: Banjo is still on the inside
[2022-06-08T01:49:31] rosheee: On leftside?
[2022-06-08T01:49:51] Unknown: Yes lol. I thought swingarm swap would eliminate banjo swap... It does not
[2022-06-08T01:49:53] Unknown: One sec
[2022-06-08T01:49:55] rosheee: Ok leftside banjo outside would look thicc
[2022-06-08T01:50:14] Unknown: <photos/photo_4665@08-06-2022_01-50-14.jpg>

[2022-06-08T01:51:21] Unknown: Ye... Just doesn't work because mounting holes are way way off center
[2022-06-08T01:51:33] Unknown: Cant flip flop calipers
[2022-06-08T01:51:34] rosheee: Customfender Gonna be carbon custom ehehe btw only 1/3 of it
[2022-06-08T01:52:27] rosheee: Put banjo down and put to arm or mount it with something to it
[2022-06-08T01:53:07] rosheee: Ah vsett deck is higher...damn
[2022-06-08T01:53:55] rosheee: Like this it gonna look
[2022-06-08T01:54:53] rosheee: And colorize the 2 rings
[2022-06-08T01:55:00] Unknown: That's with banjo swap
[2022-06-08T01:55:07] rosheee: Damn
[2022-06-08T01:55:10] Unknown: Stock Banjo is opposite side of colored circles
[2022-06-08T01:55:30] Unknown: And that is using the carbonrevo adapter kit
[2022-06-08T01:55:48] rosheee: <photos/photo_4670@08-06-2022_01-55-48.jpg>
[2022-06-08T01:56:00] rosheee: ?

[2022-06-08T01:56:35] Unknown: Carbonrevo adapter kit
[2022-06-08T01:56:50] rosheee: Ah
[2022-06-08T01:56:57] rosheee: Not my scooter xD
[2022-06-08T01:57:12] Unknown: To push caliper outward so doesn't hit tire and makes 44mm rotor holes to standard 48mm so you can use aftermarket rotors
[2022-06-08T01:57:25] Unknown: Dual Tron uses 44mm rotor screw spacing. Not standard
[2022-06-08T01:57:28] rosheee: Omg
[2022-06-08T01:57:34] rosheee: Thx god i use g30
[2022-06-08T01:57:51] rosheee: U use koolstop pads?

[2022-06-08T01:58:03] rosheee: Ok listen xD
[2022-06-08T01:58:05] Unknown: D170S sintered
[2022-06-08T01:58:14] rosheee: After done the 30x brake shit
[2022-06-08T01:58:42] Unknown: <animation>
[2022-06-08T01:58:44] rosheee: Put scooter on bench and then pure water over the brakecaliper
[2022-06-08T01:58:55] rosheee: While braking and accelerate
[2022-06-08T01:59:16] rosheee: XD everytime after rain the pads go crazy or during rain
[2022-06-08T01:59:55] rosheee: Sry for writing shitty Mobilephone omg
[2022-06-08T01:59:59] Unknown: Oh really? Honestly... I never really ever ride in wet conditions
[2022-06-08T02:00:16] rosheee: U dont have to
[2022-06-08T02:00:31] rosheee: Just pure water over them while brake
[2022-06-08T02:00:41] Unknown: And what does that do?
[2022-06-08T02:01:02] rosheee: The power is +50% after
[2022-06-08T02:01:24] Unknown: Oh... Maybe helps to break them in ?? Seat them to the rotors better?
[2022-06-08T02:01:31] rosheee: No
[2022-06-08T02:01:38] rosheee: The bite is harder
[2022-06-08T02:01:43] Unknown: Cleans the rotors and pads maybe?
[2022-06-08T02:01:45] rosheee: Performance increase
[2022-06-08T02:01:49] Unknown: Hmm.. I wonder why
[2022-06-08T02:01:57] rosheee: Oh xD that was my 2nd thought
[2022-06-08T02:02:08] rosheee: MaBe i should use brakecleaner more
[2022-06-08T02:02:13] Unknown: Maybe burns off any contamination
[2022-06-08T02:02:20] rosheee: And they start to get loud
[2022-06-08T02:02:33] Unknown: Interesting
[2022-06-08T02:02:36] Unknown: Good to know
[2022-06-08T02:03:03] Rowan Ross: Either will do, they just remove contaminants from your disks
[2022-06-08T02:03:12] Rowan Ross: Water will most likely just rinse stuff
[2022-06-08T02:03:20] Happy Giraffe: I also made MT5e caliper hot, only from 60kmh couple agrro brakings. I think it has to do with being so close to center of wheel with high rpm
[2022-06-08T02:03:22] Rowan Ross: And brakeklean will just act as a solvent
[2022-06-08T02:03:59] Happy Giraffe: Force easier to stop from higher leverage
[2022-06-08T02:05:26] Unknown: Hmmm
[2022-06-08T02:05:37] Happy Giraffe: When I put sintereds on, the braking was insanity on dry, same on wet. So if you gain something when wet you have something wrong🤔
[2022-06-08T02:05:55] Unknown: Lol
[2022-06-08T02:06:16] Happy Giraffe: You either watching porn or have sand/dirt in discs
[2022-06-08T02:07:02] Unknown: Damn, do I really need to switch my calipers and rotors to the left side? LoL. I don't wanna 😫
[2022-06-08T02:07:22] Happy Giraffe: Has magura said it only works on one way?
[2022-06-08T02:07:44] Unknown: I haven't asked
[2022-06-08T02:07:49] Happy Giraffe: Ask
[2022-06-08T02:07:52] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-06-08T02:07:54] rosheee: Yes pls

[2022-06-08T02:08:30] Unknown: Yes I will ask...
[2022-06-08T02:09:36] Happy Giraffe: I cant wait to try TRP Spyke
[2022-06-08T02:09:46] Happy Giraffe: 90€ dual mech disc😂

[2022-06-08T02:12:31] Happy Giraffe: These with xiaomi lever and ebrake hahaha
[2022-06-08T02:13:21] Happy Giraffe: Geared clutchless motor will have insane ebrake tho, motor spins 5x wheel rpm so its more efficient to return the juice as batt
[2022-06-08T02:13:59] rosheee: <video_file>

[2022-06-08T02:15:35] rosheee: Omg
[2022-06-08T02:15:41] rosheee: How long?
[2022-06-08T02:15:43] Happy Giraffe: Depends what motor?
[2022-06-08T02:15:45] rosheee: Send pics then pls
[2022-06-08T02:15:48] rosheee: 1500W
[2022-06-08T02:15:57] rosheee: For the 3 wheel riksha

[2022-06-08T17:48:51] rosheee: XD
[2022-06-08T17:48:52] rosheee: LOL
[2022-06-08T17:48:57] rosheee: BUT U GOT BEASTMODE BATTERY
[2022-06-08T17:48:59] rosheee: and ESC
[2022-06-08T17:49:00] rosheee: and motor
[2022-06-08T17:49:10] Face de Pin Sucé: Only 20S6P 40T x)
[2022-06-08T17:49:12] rosheee: can u send teh pls
[2022-06-08T17:49:17] rosheee: voltage diagram xD?
[2022-06-08T17:49:22] Mirono escooters: How you guys motors and frame just dont rip apart is beyond me
[2022-06-08T17:49:42] Mirono escooters: Wich connector handle 260a? Haha
[2022-06-08T17:49:56] rosheee: HXT8
[2022-06-08T17:49:59] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_4695@08-06-2022_17-49-59.jpg>
[2022-06-08T17:50:02] Face de Pin Sucé: speed

[2022-06-08T17:50:13] rosheee: PLS SEND XD
[2022-06-08T17:50:24] rosheee: that fucking cooling u have
[2022-06-08T17:50:31] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_4696@08-06-2022_17-50-31.jpg>
[2022-06-08T17:51:06] Face de Pin Sucé: when voltage goes high, it's because my friend was in front of me scared to go quicker and I couldn't overtake so I waited the end to pass him
[2022-06-08T17:51:34] rosheee: XD
[2022-06-08T17:54:54] rosheee: <photos/photo_4697@08-06-2022_17-54-54.jpg>
[2022-06-08T17:56:19] Paolo ⁭: Get 2 flipsky then 25kw
[2022-06-08T17:57:21] rosheee: send me your prototype
[2022-06-08T17:57:28] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-06-08T17:57:51] Paolo ⁭: 1337$
[2022-06-08T17:58:03] Кирилл: 🤔🤔🤔
[2022-06-08T17:58:48] rosheee: ok
[2022-06-08T17:58:49] rosheee: i pays
[2022-06-08T17:59:00] rosheee: here u can see the mosfet burn
[2022-06-08T17:59:07] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-06-08T17:59:16] Paolo ⁭: Then need mosfet?
[2022-06-08T17:59:30] rosheee: ?
[2022-06-08T17:59:33] rosheee: U HAVE NO MOSFET?
[2022-06-08T17:59:47] Paolo ⁭: For replace your TRONIC
[2022-06-08T17:59:50] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-06-08T18:00:41] rosheee: and yes
[2022-06-08T18:00:45] rosheee: need mosfet
[2022-06-08T18:00:48] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-06-08T18:00:55] rosheee: i bet they never send
[2022-06-08T18:01:17] Кирилл: Yes, but I admit that there could be a breakdown on the frame
[2022-06-08T18:28:30] rosheee: if they dont send me new controller
[2022-06-08T18:28:44] rosheee: i need 20h to get infront of their door incl. flight and transport
[2022-06-08T18:29:03] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-06-08T18:43:58] rosheee: the only thing never melts are pc mosfets
[2022-06-08T18:44:08] rosheee: push 300A no prob
[2022-06-08T18:44:28] rosheee: maybe use mainboard as controller
[2022-06-08T20:42:48] Luis Magalhaes: need 200+ amps to each motor 🤣
[2022-06-08T20:46:30] Luis Magalhaes: i fucked a bearing on mine
[2022-06-08T20:46:31] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_4698@08-06-2022_20-46-31.jpg>
[2022-06-08T20:46:40] Mirono escooters: F
[2022-06-08T20:47:32] Luis Magalhaes: will be a pain in the ass to close the side with the cables again
[2022-06-08T20:47:36] Luis Magalhaes: 😅
[2022-06-08T20:48:14] Mirono escooters: Oh yes, haha
[2022-06-08T20:51:31] Paolo ⁭: Which winding is your motor?
[2022-06-08T21:02:15] Luis Magalhaes: 22x3
[2022-06-08T21:05:10] Paolo ⁭: Then no high Kv
[2022-06-08T21:05:24] Paolo ⁭: Rion / mine are 33x2
[2022-06-08T21:05:26] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-06-08T21:07:38] Luis Magalhaes: More than that is too much for my setup 😂
[2022-06-08T21:08:47] Paolo ⁭: But you go 20s
[2022-06-08T21:09:04] Paolo ⁭: I can 130kmh gps with 18s no field weakening or similar shit
[2022-06-08T21:17:39] Luis Magalhaes: Mine is 16S
[2022-06-08T21:18:21] Luis Magalhaes: With vesc i hit 100kmh
[2022-06-08T21:30:02] Paolo ⁭: I like reach it in 8 seconds xd
[2022-06-08T21:47:47] Luis Magalhaes: You guys are brute's 😂
[2022-06-08T21:48:09] Luis Magalhaes: 8sec till 100km would be fun 😍
[2022-06-08T22:05:32] Paolo ⁭: With little downhill it’s possible with Kelly 7218
[2022-06-08T22:05:51] Paolo ⁭: Otherwise In flat road should take about 12 second
[2022-06-08T22:09:03] Luis Magalhaes: im runing my setup with 25% battery and 100% motor 😅
[2022-06-08T22:09:44] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_4699@08-06-2022_22-09-44.jpg>
[2022-06-08T22:09:49] Luis Magalhaes: waiting for this
[2022-06-08T22:10:04] Mirono escooters: Gg
[2022-06-08T22:11:12] Luis Magalhaes: then push it and hope i dont kill a motor 🤣🤣
[2022-06-08T22:12:10] sombre_enfant: Why not make it straight layout ? Its 16x8 right ?
[2022-06-08T22:13:22] Luis Magalhaes: yes 16/8
[2022-06-08T22:13:42] Luis Magalhaes: its a friend that made it
[2022-06-08T22:14:14] sombre_enfant: Bridged here or the other, it will heat asf
[2022-06-08T22:14:33] sombre_enfant: But very clean build
[2022-06-08T22:16:10] Mirono escooters: Prob dual layers like me
[2022-06-08T22:25:13] Luis Magalhaes: ok will pass all current from there
[2022-06-08T22:52:34] Unknown: I was wondering the same. Will need jumpers for the series connection from one side to another
[2022-06-08T22:52:55] rosheee: lol?
[2022-06-08T22:53:05] Unknown: If you bridge there only 2 cells are transferring the current from one P group to another
[2022-06-08T22:54:08] Paolo ⁭: Only 16s?
[2022-06-08T22:54:10] Unknown: <photos/photo_4701@08-06-2022_22-54-10.jpg>
[2022-06-08T22:55:29] Unknown: The furthest cells will struggle to discharge evenly. Entire P group of current is bottlenecking at that 2 cell interconnect. 8p worth of current passing through 2 cells of connections
[2022-06-08T22:55:39] Mirono escooters: Better horizontal series layers
[2022-06-08T22:56:12] Mirono escooters: wonder why this design choice
[2022-06-08T22:56:29] Unknown: Like this... Horrible cell layout
[2022-06-08T22:56:58] sombre_enfant: This happen a lot on ebike but they less devil on amps than us
[2022-06-08T22:58:06] Mirono escooters: Ebike cell layout can be super tricky
[2022-06-08T22:58:29] Unknown: Usually yes... In any case having so little series connections is not good for heat, even discharge or resistance. Furthest cells can discharge slower and then the p groups equalize causing even more stress
[2022-06-08T22:58:39] Unknown: Ebike triangle layouts very tricky
[2022-06-08T22:58:41] Mirono escooters: I used 2 1awg cable to bridge series connection, because Otherwise id have a super long 1 cell series connection, haha
[2022-06-08T22:58:43] sombre_enfant: Thinking about layout blow my head up when its not common one
[2022-06-08T22:59:15] Unknown: Haha.. so true. Love rectangle scooter decks
[2022-06-08T22:59:56] Unknown: Yes, maybe even multiple bridges or a 2nd layer of plate to help distribute. More robust series connections the better
[2022-06-08T23:00:00] Mirono escooters: I forced myself to take breaks and think and sleep over it, i knew i would make mistakes otherwise
[2022-06-08T23:00:17] Mirono escooters: Used 2 layers on 2 points i doubted
[2022-06-08T23:00:36] Mirono escooters: Max delta v 0.03 60a, standstill 0.01, wich i find super good
[2022-06-08T23:00:54] Unknown: Same here even tho mine wasn't super complicated that way. Would lay in bed and brainstorm for hours the best way to do certain crucial steps 🙈
[2022-06-08T23:01:46] Mirono escooters: I couldnt sleep haha
[2022-06-08T23:01:55] Mirono escooters: Making it was therapy with copper
[2022-06-08T23:02:07] Unknown: Absolutely. The cells within each p group will quickly balance/equalize themselves so watching the delta directly after applying load/riding is helpful to get an accurate idea
[2022-06-08T23:02:19] Mirono escooters: If i were normal id do 5p and no special shit But if i see unused space i go brrrr
[2022-06-08T23:02:31] Unknown: Dude.. same here. Literally awake at night figure things out in my brain
[2022-06-08T23:02:36] Mirono escooters: Yea haha Bluetooth for W
[2022-06-08T23:02:51] Unknown: Nice 👍
[2022-06-08T23:03:10] rosheee: WHUAT
[2022-06-08T23:03:12] rosheee: how
[2022-06-08T23:05:59] Happy Giraffe: Biggest win is to use scooter battery on ebike🌚
[2022-06-08T23:06:44] Mirono escooters: Backpack gang
[2022-06-08T23:06:51] rosheee: fuckeria
[2022-06-08T23:08:46] Happy Giraffe: 13s6p so small it should fit in a triangle bag ez
[2022-06-08T23:09:35] Mirono escooters: 15s8p not so
[2022-06-08T23:10:17] Luis Magalhaes: Yes 😂
[2022-06-08T23:15:00] Luis Magalhaes: So not a good choice of design 😅 noted and passed to him too
[2022-06-08T23:15:17] Luis Magalhaes: Thanks for all the info mates inapreciate it 💪
[2022-06-08T23:15:22] rosheee: dude
[2022-06-08T23:15:24] rosheee: DUDES
[2022-06-08T23:15:25] Luis Magalhaes: I appreciate
[2022-06-08T23:15:26] rosheee: use this AI
[2022-06-08T23:15:32] rosheee: https://app.voltx.ai/
[2022-06-08T23:17:42] Mirono escooters: I use my head
[2022-06-08T23:17:45] Mirono escooters: Or 3d printer
[2022-06-08T23:20:49] rosheee: iaja
[2022-06-08T23:26:23] Happy Giraffe: Need a hardtail bike🌚
[2022-06-08T23:28:56] sombre_enfant: Do a surron type frame ?
[2022-06-08T23:29:15] sombre_enfant: If you on that swiss budget
[2022-06-09T00:04:18] Luis Magalhaes: <video_file>
[2022-06-09T00:04:51] Luis Magalhaes: i talk to him about the double layer he is doing it 👍 thanks for the advice
[2022-06-09T00:05:57] Unknown: Hmm.. I mean, that isn't a half bad idea... Probably one of the best options for making the series connection from side to side. I like it
[2022-06-09T00:06:23] Unknown: The extra overlapped copper will help tremendously
[2022-06-09T00:08:05] Unknown: My next question is where will the main terminals be? Opposite the overlapped copper I assume...
[2022-06-09T00:08:52] Unknown: <photos/photo_4703@09-06-2022_00-08-52.jpg>
[2022-06-09T00:11:33] Unknown: That should actually work out okay... Decent enough series connection between P8 and P9. Main + and - on the opposite side of that series connection. Good 👍. I hope there is insulation between the p groups 😬
[2022-06-09T00:11:54] Mirono escooters: Hope too
[2022-06-09T00:12:06] Unknown: <photos/photo_4704@09-06-2022_00-12-06.jpg>
[2022-06-09T00:12:10] Unknown: Insulation?
[2022-06-09T00:12:34] Mirono escooters: Right top, ali bms to power it😀
[2022-06-09T00:12:35] Unknown: Fish paper, wax paper, kapton, anything... Please say yes
[2022-06-09T00:13:00] Mirono escooters: That + design looks cool, but what purpose
[2022-06-09T00:13:05] Unknown: Oh God no. Use Ant or JK plz
[2022-06-09T00:13:16] Mirono escooters: Was joking
[2022-06-09T00:13:18] Mirono escooters: Hope ant
[2022-06-09T00:13:22] Mirono escooters: Love ant
[2022-06-09T00:13:41] Unknown: LoL hope it's not cheapo BMS
[2022-06-09T00:13:58] Mirono escooters: Surely he got knowledge, i hope, haha
[2022-06-09T00:14:01] Unknown: Cheap BMS usually small but like she says... Size matters 😜
[2022-06-09T00:14:13] Mirono escooters: (Its 3s it wont be the bms)
[2022-06-09T00:14:35] Happy Giraffe: I do normal mtb and stealthy build
[2022-06-09T00:14:47] Happy Giraffe: Otherwise would have done moto
[2022-06-09T00:15:24] Unknown: I would love to get my hands on a Surron type frame for my 24F 🤗
[2022-06-09T00:15:40] Mirono escooters: Me too, haha
[2022-06-09T00:15:58] Mirono escooters: Money. Ill stick with my normal for now, its already super
[2022-06-09T00:16:58] Happy Giraffe: Would have bought Vector typhoon or something and QS205/273😂
[2022-06-09T00:17:51] Luis Magalhaes: ant
[2022-06-09T00:19:05] Happy Giraffe: Pedal only bike is cop worry free
[2022-06-09T00:19:29] Happy Giraffe: If you have a 10,000w capable one they gonna make your life uncomfortable
[2022-06-09T00:20:51] Mirono escooters: I fake pedal haha
[2022-06-09T00:20:57] Luis Magalhaes: cheking with him
[2022-06-09T00:21:01] Unknown: Unfortunately my 24F is potted with no access to internal PAS port 🙄
[2022-06-09T00:21:08] Mirono escooters: That sucks, a lot
[2022-06-09T00:21:11] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-06-09T00:21:17] Mirono escooters: Why didnt they get it out with wires..
[2022-06-09T00:21:21] Unknown: Yea... May be able to get to it
[2022-06-09T00:21:30] Unknown: Original buyer didn't request
[2022-06-09T00:21:34] rosheee: ^^
[2022-06-09T00:21:34] Happy Giraffe: PAS is gay, you only want torque sensor
[2022-06-09T00:21:48] Happy Giraffe: PAS is just a fancy on/off button, horrible
[2022-06-09T00:21:50] Unknown: Yup... Can always wire that in 👍
[2022-06-09T00:23:29] Unknown: Hmmm. Interesting
[2022-06-09T00:23:55] Unknown: Just had a guy message me yesterday that he would trade 2 24Fs for my 1 24F if mine had PAS wires lol
[2022-06-09T00:24:07] Happy Giraffe: It only measures if magnets move forward or not
[2022-06-09T00:24:14] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2022-06-09T00:24:32] Mirono escooters: Use throttle and pedal fake😚
[2022-06-09T00:27:56] Happy Giraffe: Is it so hard to remove potting?🌚
[2022-06-09T00:30:11] Happy Giraffe: And depending on 24f other ports if it has ppm etc. he can use cycle analyst for it
[2022-06-09T00:30:47] Happy Giraffe: Vesc doesnt have pas support afaik even with the tab called PAS
[2022-06-09T00:41:10] Luis Magalhaes: kapton in all groups
[2022-06-09T00:41:15] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2022-06-09T00:41:55] Unknown: Oh good good
[2022-06-09T00:52:05] Luis Magalhaes: Adam is asking if this is enough for the outputs of the battery? or if he should do like what he did in the midle of the battery
[2022-06-09T00:52:05] Luis Magalhaes: Vê la se é isto? Ou ele tava a dizer para fazer com dobra aqui também
[2022-06-09T00:52:37] Luis Magalhaes: the way on the video or like this
[2022-06-09T00:52:37] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_4705@09-06-2022_00-52-37.jpg>
[2022-06-09T00:53:19] Luis Magalhaes: it will have 2 positive and 2 negative wire for the controller
[2022-06-09T00:53:23] Luis Magalhaes: controllers
[2022-06-09T00:55:16] Unknown: The way on the video with the folded over side seems more robust to me. For the terminal side (battery wires) I would do the folded over or doubled up copper layers like this...
[2022-06-09T00:56:33] Unknown: <photos/photo_4706@09-06-2022_00-56-33.jpg>

[2022-06-09T00:57:22] Unknown: Can fold over the sides or fold back over on top of itself. Solder wires FIRST then spot weld to the cells. Don't solder wires after copper is welded to the cells since you don't want to introduce heat to them
[2022-06-09T00:58:18] Unknown: You want your main wires to cover as many of the cell tips as possible for even draw/discharge
[2022-06-09T00:58:56] Unknown: Same with the series connections wherever possible
[2022-06-09T00:59:05] Unknown: More coverage is best
[2022-06-09T01:00:01] Luis Magalhaes: ok thanks
[2022-06-09T01:00:06] Unknown: <photos/photo_4712@09-06-2022_01-00-06.jpg>
[2022-06-09T01:00:10] Luis Magalhaes: i send this to him 😁
[2022-06-09T01:00:35] Unknown: Spot weld lower layer first (blue dots) then fold main over on top
[2022-06-09T01:00:52] Luis Magalhaes: that way will not crack the cooper ?
[2022-06-09T01:01:14] Unknown: Yup, that and will not heat the cells with soldering of the wires
[2022-06-09T01:01:15] Luis Magalhaes: my kaabo battery has this but folded outside
[2022-06-09T01:01:20] Unknown: Solder the wires to copper first
[2022-06-09T01:01:31] Unknown: You can fold outside too.. same idea
[2022-06-09T01:01:41] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2022-06-09T01:01:43] Luis Magalhaes: ok
[2022-06-09T01:01:46] Unknown: 🤓
[2022-06-09T01:02:17] Luis Magalhaes: im the tester for his first spotwelded cooper battery so help me god 🤣🤣
[2022-06-09T01:02:45] Luis Magalhaes: he has done his battery in nikel and iron soldered the cooper
[2022-06-09T01:02:59] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-06-09T01:03:01] Unknown: LoL. As long as it's done properly with care, should be fine. There are obviously proper ways to do things and not proper ways
[2022-06-09T01:03:01] Luis Magalhaes: now he invested in the kweld to spot weld
[2022-06-09T01:03:32] Unknown: K-Weld is awesome. I used Malectrics V4 and worked great with .1 copper and nickel plated steel tabs
[2022-06-09T01:03:51] Mirono escooters: Kweld gang
[2022-06-09T01:04:01] Luis Magalhaes: yes, he said he done that type of design before in nikel but he triple nikel in that weak spot and put there the temperature sensor too
[2022-06-09T01:04:03] Unknown: I wanted K-Weld but malectrics V4 was way more than good enough. Awesome welder actually
[2022-06-09T01:04:15] Mirono escooters: True
[2022-06-09T01:04:18] Mirono escooters: I like overkill, haha
[2022-06-09T01:04:19] Unknown: Good good
[2022-06-09T01:04:30] Mirono escooters: And i use it so much, i just went with best
[2022-06-09T01:04:33] Unknown: I do too... If you haven't noticed 😜
[2022-06-09T01:04:52] Mirono escooters: You are next level
[2022-06-09T01:05:03] Unknown: I try 🤓
[2022-06-09T01:05:05] Mirono escooters: why live so far, i feel like wed get along well😂
[2022-06-09T01:05:25] Unknown: Agreed brother
[2022-06-09T01:05:36] Mirono escooters: Belgium boring
[2022-06-09T01:05:39] Mirono escooters: No one
[2022-06-09T01:05:51] Mirono escooters: Most are uk haha
[2022-06-09T01:05:59] Mirono escooters: Spain also popular
[2022-06-09T01:06:00] Unknown: Where I am.. nobody either 😫
[2022-06-09T01:06:50] Mirono escooters: But you got not muxh rules or caring cops it compensates
[2022-06-09T01:06:50] Mirono escooters: Eh, i should be less scared. It got so strict last years
[2022-06-09T01:07:23] Luis Magalhaes: come all to portugal 🤣
[2022-06-09T01:07:43] Mirono escooters: Bet
[2022-06-09T01:07:48] Happy Giraffe: You teach us to play football like CR7
[2022-06-09T01:07:59] Mirono escooters: Pay me a ticket or some big 1000km range package 😚
[2022-06-09T01:08:06] Luis Magalhaes: Adam the nucular team was thinking of coming here too, they talked to a russian friend who is his custumer too 😂
[2022-06-09T01:08:23] Luis Magalhaes: have to learn too 🤣
[2022-06-09T01:08:55] Luis Magalhaes: that would be a life time story ride haha
[2022-06-09T01:10:19] Mirono escooters: Backpack batt 100km a day, would e a fun trip
[2022-06-09T01:11:27] Luis Magalhaes: i can do 100km 😜
[2022-06-09T01:11:31] Luis Magalhaes: 54Ah
[2022-06-09T01:11:44] Luis Magalhaes: if i go 40kmh i can do like 90km
[2022-06-09T01:12:03] Luis Magalhaes: with the sinewave i think i can do a litle more
[2022-06-09T01:12:31] Luis Magalhaes: one time i did a crazy thing too but with the minimotors controller
[2022-06-09T01:12:39] Luis Magalhaes: let me see if i still have it LOL
[2022-06-09T01:17:35] Luis Magalhaes: <div class='strava-embed-placeholder' data-embed-type='activity' data-embed-id='4919280641'></div><script src='https://strava-embeds.com/embed.js'></script>
[2022-06-09T01:17:40] Luis Magalhaes: shit
[2022-06-09T01:18:43] Mirono escooters: Hmm, depends on speed, but at 35kmh with backpack and frame batt, defenitely 130+
[2022-06-09T01:18:48] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_4713@09-06-2022_01-18-48.jpg>
[2022-06-09T01:19:06] Mirono escooters: Sick app
[2022-06-09T01:19:15] Mirono escooters: Prefer bike for that, standing that long
[2022-06-09T01:19:17] Luis Magalhaes: 128km in 4:46hours 26.9avg speed in kmh🤣
[2022-06-09T01:19:35] Mirono escooters: 25kmh stoxk is so boring, xd
[2022-06-09T01:19:38] Mirono escooters: U get used to speed
[2022-06-09T01:19:53] Mirono escooters: I Gotta sleep, got exams, haha *cries*
[2022-06-09T01:20:09] Luis Magalhaes: true, i have to do a bike setup but not too powerfull so my wife can ride it too 🤣
[2022-06-09T01:20:25] Unknown: Omg I wish man. Hopefully they will be moving soon and continuing their successful designs
[2022-06-09T01:20:29] Mirono escooters: Eh 200a phase will work
[2022-06-09T01:20:41] Luis Magalhaes: true, it was fucking boring did not do it again 🤣
[2022-06-09T01:20:45] Mirono escooters: I loved scoots, but bike stole heart how it rides
[2022-06-09T01:20:52] Mirono escooters: Will use both depending what when
[2022-06-09T01:21:30] Luis Magalhaes: have to buy a kit and transform one 😁
[2022-06-09T01:21:46] Mirono escooters: Its fairly simple especially the kits
[2022-06-09T01:22:58] Luis Magalhaes: Adam you use a active balancer ? does it protect the discharg amps too ?
[2022-06-09T01:23:23] Mirono escooters: How would it
[2022-06-09T01:27:36] Unknown: Yes I use JK BMS. It has discharge/charge protection and active balancer that can be set to a certain delta V difference and toggled on/off as needed
[2022-06-09T01:28:19] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2022-06-09T01:28:48] Unknown: <photos/photo_4714@09-06-2022_01-28-48.jpg>
[2022-06-09T01:28:57] Mirono escooters: Oh misunderstood question, thougt such a balancer without charge discharge features, like powerwalls Sorry
[2022-06-09T01:29:19] Unknown: 150a continuous discharge. 300a max discharge, 1A active balancer.
[2022-06-09T01:29:26] Unknown: <photos/photo_4715@09-06-2022_01-29-26.jpg>
[2022-06-09T01:29:39] Unknown: Has been working flawlessly for 100+ days
[2022-06-09T01:30:48] Mirono escooters: 0.001v delta
[2022-06-09T01:30:53] Mirono escooters: Flexer
[2022-06-09T01:31:12] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2022-06-09T01:31:26] Mirono escooters: Im happy with my 0.02😂
[2022-06-09T01:32:18] Unknown: JK BMS is beast but not super small.
[2022-06-09T01:32:19] Unknown: <photos/photo_4717@09-06-2022_01-32-19.jpg>
[2022-06-09T01:32:19] Unknown: <photos/photo_4718@09-06-2022_01-32-19.jpg>
[2022-06-09T01:32:20] Unknown: <photos/photo_4719@09-06-2022_01-32-20.jpg>
[2022-06-09T01:33:16] Mirono escooters: Expected that for specs
[2022-06-09T01:33:39] Mirono escooters: Even basic ant for price is so good Long cables, super app, and build quality was top
[2022-06-09T01:34:02] Mirono escooters: The busbars between mos.. some Chinese loved their design
[2022-06-09T01:34:14] Mirono escooters: Ps, ant
[2022-06-09T01:37:08] Happy Giraffe: Fucking C
[2022-06-09T01:47:15] Happy Giraffe: Coding is so tough when you keep a break you forget so much🙈
[2022-06-09T01:49:45] Unknown: Haha. Yes indeed. They overbuilt this BMS which is always good. Temps have gotten above 32C on 150a discharge
[2022-06-09T02:50:08] rosheee: C?
[2022-06-09T02:54:28] Happy Giraffe: Tried that also😂
[2022-06-09T03:06:59] Artem Bulashev: Yeah, I never seen such clean pcb design with copper Ultrasonically welded
[2022-06-09T03:07:05] Artem Bulashev: Next level
[2022-06-09T03:07:07] Artem Bulashev: And only 70€
[2022-06-09T03:07:46] Artem Bulashev: For 60-100a and like 75€ for 80-120a in same size
[2022-06-09T11:29:10] Konstantin: Fun staff, max current flash on eeprom or MCU, can change max value more hi...only max which write on sticker
[2022-06-09T11:38:31] Paolo ⁭: Only because the super balancing xd
[2022-06-09T12:09:09] Artem Bulashev: Different amount of fets
[2022-06-09T12:09:31] Artem Bulashev: My 6p 60amps has 2 gets less than 8p 80a
[2022-06-09T12:09:36] Artem Bulashev: Same casing
[2022-06-09T12:09:51] Artem Bulashev: So not always :)
[2022-06-09T12:13:56] Konstantin: Y... bought 6fets, solder 2+2, and only youuuuuuu... 60 maxxxxx... But f..k solder few shunt, or just re calibration current senses, and flyyyyy
[2022-06-09T12:14:50] Konstantin: It's was lazy to desolder 24*** eeprom, or try to dump hex (MCU looks like stm32 etc..)
[2022-06-09T12:31:31] Mirono escooters: Hoy, wich loud buzzer you guys use? I accidentally ordered a alarm, haha
[2022-06-09T14:03:25] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_4721@09-06-2022_14-03-25.jpg>
[2022-06-09T14:03:25] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_4722@09-06-2022_14-03-25.jpg>
[2022-06-09T14:03:27] Paolo ⁭: Bye
[2022-06-09T14:03:41] Mirono escooters: Lovely
[2022-06-09T14:07:17] Happy Giraffe: The bulky horn with usb c
[2022-06-09T14:07:41] Mirono escooters: Id prefer a simple buzzer, i got a switch for leds and horn and blinkers
[2022-06-09T14:07:46] Mirono escooters: Less buttons the better
[2022-06-09T14:08:13] Happy Giraffe: Yeah it has one button and remote, doubles as alarm
[2022-06-09T14:08:33] Mirono escooters: Alarm? That's cool
[2022-06-09T14:13:03] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_4723@09-06-2022_14-13-03.jpg>
[2022-06-09T14:13:09] Mirono escooters: This will do
[2022-06-09T14:13:48] Mirono escooters: 328db? Chinese is just hitting head on keyboard
[2022-06-09T14:37:40] Artem Bulashev: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2022-06-09T14:37:40] Artem Bulashev: One beep will destroy the planet
[2022-06-09T14:37:40] Artem Bulashev: 172db traveled the world 7 times in 5 days. 😂😂
[2022-06-09T14:37:42] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_4725@09-06-2022_14-37-42.jpg>
[2022-06-09T14:38:04] Mirono escooters: China with specs always
[2022-06-09T14:38:22] Mirono escooters: Car annoys you? Just beep, car will be gone
[2022-06-09T14:38:45] Mirono escooters: If i had 3 wishes, one would be id always have 0 annoying cars in my way, haha
[2022-06-09T14:39:02] Mirono escooters: Or i shouldnt ride faster then cars but that's not an option
[2022-06-09T14:39:59] Happy Giraffe: 328db, earth would explode I guess
[2022-06-09T14:40:45] Mirono escooters: I dont even think its physically possible
[2022-06-09T14:41:07] Mirono escooters: Oddly enough, in air, a sound can't get any higher than about 194 decibels and in water it's around 270. This is because sound is an example of something where the measurements break down at either end of the scale
[2022-06-09T14:41:11] Mirono escooters: I was right
[2022-06-09T14:41:41] Mirono escooters: At that level the negative part of the waveform is a vacuum and cannot rarify any more.
[2022-06-09T14:41:57] Mirono escooters: Ok i should learn for exams, not this Have a great day everyone
[2022-06-09T14:42:24] Happy Giraffe: Chinese wanna end the world
[2022-06-09T14:59:00] Mirono escooters: Ok 1 thought before i go again 1 is vesc field weakening ok? 2 is it worth it on a ebike? If u do 10a weakening is it extra and from batt current?
[2022-06-09T15:15:47] Artem Bulashev: Spintend will officially be in FW6!
[2022-06-09T15:15:51] Artem Bulashev: “I have commited the Ubox hardware support into the VESC source code now, will officially supported from FW 6.0.”
[2022-06-09T15:16:05] Mirono escooters: Whats new?
[2022-06-09T15:18:35] Artem Bulashev: No more custom fw
[2022-06-09T15:18:49] Artem Bulashev: They wanted to use normal fw in 5.3 but didn’t work out
[2022-06-09T15:19:04] Mirono escooters: I mean, what advantages do fw6 have
[2022-06-09T15:19:12] Artem Bulashev: No idea
[2022-06-09T15:19:27] Mirono escooters: Newer is better, haha
[2022-06-09T15:19:29] Artem Bulashev: Point is that ubox will be officially supported on stock original fw6.0
[2022-06-09T15:19:35] Mirono escooters: Good
[2022-06-09T15:19:38] Artem Bulashev: No custom Spintend fw needed
[2022-06-09T15:19:58] Rowan Ross: Where did they tell you this?
[2022-06-09T15:20:05] Rowan Ross: You have their wechat?

[2022-06-09T15:20:29] Artem Bulashev: Yea i speak with their engineer daily
[2022-06-09T15:20:35] Rowan Ross: Nice
[2022-06-09T15:20:59] Mirono escooters: You got contacts haha
[2022-06-09T15:23:54] Happy Giraffe: But only new models?
[2022-06-09T15:31:28] Artem Bulashev: No
[2022-06-09T15:31:40] Artem Bulashev: See micro and typeC
[2022-06-09T15:31:46] Artem Bulashev: That is red ubox dual old once
[2022-06-09T15:31:58] Artem Bulashev: Officially supported in fw6 built in
[2022-06-09T15:33:17] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, so the voltage measurement thingy was only the first model?
[2022-06-09T15:40:39] rosheee: 220A bms from 23 to 24C Dalylama
[2022-06-09T15:41:17] rosheee: XD u sing faster than mr
[2022-06-09T15:41:18] rosheee: Me
[2022-06-09T16:17:42] Konstantin: 220amps... So cute...
[2022-06-09T16:18:30] Konstantin: <photos/photo_4729@09-06-2022_16-18-30.jpg>
[2022-06-09T16:22:44] Mirono escooters: Jezus
[2022-06-09T16:22:50] Mirono escooters: Powerwall?
[2022-06-09T16:28:24] rosheee: Ya dude g30
[2022-06-09T16:28:40] rosheee: Where u use dat? M365 1s?
[2022-06-09T16:28:52] rosheee: 800A battery?
[2022-06-09T16:29:35] Paolo ⁭: 0awg wire cool
[2022-06-09T16:29:38] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-06-09T16:29:53] Mirono escooters: -2 awg
[2022-06-09T16:29:57] Mirono escooters: Gg
[2022-06-09T16:30:13] Mirono escooters: I wonder how i mount heatsink and have waterpeoof
[2022-06-09T16:33:41] Konstantin: Build w friend big e-scooter. 2motor like 1, 2 wheels 4 motors and 4 esc
[2022-06-09T16:34:53] Happy Giraffe: Make heatsink part of a controller box
[2022-06-09T16:35:26] Happy Giraffe: Bolt it to box, then bolt esc to heatsink?
[2022-06-09T16:36:18] Mirono escooters: Problably, idk where controller final place is so thats 4 later
[2022-06-09T16:38:01] Happy Giraffe: I dont need cooling so it will just be a bit bigger box that has space for all the cables and Adc adapter/bt
[2022-06-09T16:40:42] Mirono escooters: I do haha
[2022-06-09T16:40:46] Mirono escooters: 60/200
[2022-06-09T16:46:00] sombre_enfant: The quad motor scooter its ass
[2022-06-09T16:47:43] Happy Giraffe: Then you need to know exactly what you are doing with the heatsink + have correct sizing. Otherwise it wont work😅
[2022-06-09T16:48:00] Happy Giraffe: 200a phase will not be easy on small vesc
[2022-06-09T16:48:05] Mirono escooters: I always know what im doing😘
[2022-06-09T16:48:26] Happy Giraffe: Yeah I remember the 5gram alu heatsinks you put🌚😂😂😂😂
[2022-06-09T16:48:28] Mirono escooters: Surprisingly it heats very slowly, way slower then i was expecting
[2022-06-09T16:48:39] Mirono escooters: well, why not. :)
[2022-06-09T16:48:43] Happy Giraffe: Sensor is where it needs to be?
[2022-06-09T16:48:49] Mirono escooters: Inside controllee
[2022-06-09T16:48:51] Mirono escooters: R
[2022-06-09T16:49:01] Mirono escooters: And i use hand to feel too, casing heats slowly
[2022-06-09T16:49:08] Happy Giraffe: Yeah but next to mosfet or🤔
[2022-06-09T16:49:37] Mirono escooters: Good question, haha
[2022-06-09T16:49:48] Konstantin: No...
[2022-06-09T16:49:55] Mirono escooters: I do hit 80* haha, but after like 20 mins of pushing it haard
[2022-06-09T16:50:03] Happy Giraffe: Tbh depending on how the measurements are, I would get a heatsink bigger than vesc and just bolt it into it if the mosfets are on the same level
[2022-06-09T16:50:03] Mirono escooters: A heatsink + aircooling should do it.
[2022-06-09T16:50:15] Konstantin: It's 2 wheels...all classic, inside 2 motors...;)
[2022-06-09T16:50:16] Konstantin: <photos/photo_4732@09-06-2022_16-50-16.jpg>

[2022-06-09T16:50:22] Mirono escooters: Vesc has mounting holes so ill just screw it on
[2022-06-09T16:50:32] Happy Giraffe: And mosfets are on top?
[2022-06-09T16:50:50] Mirono escooters: On the side where it bolts yes
[2022-06-09T16:51:01] Mirono escooters: Engineers used brain for 5 seconds
[2022-06-09T16:52:14] Happy Giraffe: If they are at same level then it shouldnt be hard, just needs to be a big ass heatsink and optimal connection
[2022-06-09T16:52:33] Mirono escooters: I got my bitcoin miner
[2022-06-09T16:52:50] Mirono escooters: If i see size of my dead sabvoton i respect vesc how little it heats
[2022-06-09T16:53:16] Mirono escooters: Put ves inside sabvoton case is also option
[2022-06-09T16:53:25] Mirono escooters: And waterproof
[2022-06-09T16:57:23] Happy Giraffe: Yeah but you want the closest path of heat to travel if you push extra amps, mosfet-heatsink-riding air directly on there
[2022-06-09T16:57:48] Happy Giraffe: So its only the ~3mm alu sink departing mosfet from air
[2022-06-09T16:57:55] sombre_enfant: How you can be in sync ?
[2022-06-09T16:58:44] rosheee: Cable
[2022-06-09T16:59:06] Mirono escooters: Im Not that overkill, haha Ill see how well just a big aircooled heatsink goes
[2022-06-09T17:02:25] Happy Giraffe: I mean its easy to do and gives best performance, the temp difference between mosfet and heatsink is biggest possible there so it soaks heat away best
[2022-06-09T17:02:56] Mirono escooters: I know
[2022-06-09T17:02:58] Happy Giraffe: If its not directly on air it might be worse but not sure how it works in practice
[2022-06-09T17:03:05] Mirono escooters: Next is liquid cooling
[2022-06-09T17:03:17] Happy Giraffe: This is better than liquid
[2022-06-09T17:03:24] Mirono escooters: Tbh a small water pump and 0.5l reservoir. Its nothing in a big ebike
[2022-06-09T17:03:42] Mirono escooters: And would look cool, haha
[2022-06-09T23:50:22] Gigolo Joe: W I D E BOISSS
[2022-06-10T00:00:00] rosheee: why for what?
[2022-06-10T00:00:16] rosheee: i heard it isn't that effective
[2022-06-10T00:04:06] Happy Giraffe: You forget laws of physics still somewhat apply in our world
[2022-06-10T00:04:52] Happy Giraffe: Liquid only good for long period load adding thermal mass
[2022-06-10T00:07:38] Happy Giraffe: Bottleneck always will be the coldplate/material just next to heat source. Reason why GPU coolers are so effective in RTX 3090ti class gpus is the direct die contact. Not even a IHS (integrated heatspreader there)🌚
[2022-06-10T00:08:15] Mirono escooters: *i was joking*
[2022-06-10T00:08:29] Happy Giraffe: This applies even to heatsinks
[2022-06-10T00:09:28] Happy Giraffe: 80-90% of all heatsink and cooling solutions around us are junk. Most graphics cards 2 years ago same story😅
[2022-06-10T02:17:20] Artem Bulashev: Which is why I always wondered when people add aluminum plate between case and scooter body 😄
[2022-06-10T02:17:57] Artem Bulashev: Each layer means layer + layer of paste And each of those has thermal resistance
[2022-06-10T02:18:10] Artem Bulashev: So I don’t know if it makes sense or not
[2022-06-10T02:18:21] Artem Bulashev: In theory it should not but should 😂
[2022-06-10T02:18:34] Happy Giraffe: Chicken or the egg?
[2022-06-10T02:19:58] Happy Giraffe: But it must be hard to bolt esc mosfet directly to frame if mosfet ain't elevated couple mm atleast🤔
[2022-06-10T06:44:09] rosheee: Which arent direct die ?

[2022-06-10T14:28:59] Mirono escooters: I guess you need to take off motor casing? 😅
[2022-06-10T14:29:41] sombre_enfant: Yeah only way but its aint normal and on both, even if i do this slowly and totally straight it dont come off
[2022-06-10T14:30:05] Mirono escooters: That would indeed be weird
[2022-06-10T15:00:25] rosheee: !0aAS@@!@y2€
[2022-06-10T15:03:01] Happy Giraffe: To take rim in half you dont need to open motor on Blade

[2022-06-11T00:39:50] Unknown: Mt5 single pad setup doesn't come with the pad screws. Made my own from m4 screws lol. Grind down the threads and polish. Perfect fit 😉

[2022-06-11T00:41:08] Unknown: Kind of tardo MT5 factory single pad doesn't come with pad screws 🙄. Like, just include the damn the screws please
[2022-06-11T00:45:53] Unknown: Jagwire hyflow lines and jagwire "HOPE" quick connect kit worked out beautifully. Solid connections and no leaks at all. Banjo/line now lives on the outside of the caliper.

[2022-06-11T00:58:15] Unknown: MT5s came with the crap single split pads and no pad screws for the single 4pc pads. So I made my own pad screws from m4 x25mm typical screws
[2022-06-11T00:58:51] Unknown: Thank you 🤓
[2022-06-11T01:00:22] Mirko Boni: I have mounted the magura MT5 in my ninebot G30! it was really difficult because there is no space

[2022-06-11T01:19:27] Unknown: Why not put the brake line on the outside with m6 banjo?
[2022-06-11T01:19:47] Unknown: That's what I did using the jagwire lines and hope quick connect kit
[2022-06-11T01:19:49] Mirko Boni: No, I use the ECU modified by sombre
[2022-06-11T01:20:08] Unknown: Banjo and line are now on the outside, same side as the colored circles

[2022-06-11T01:36:10] Unknown: Yes it does. And same metal washer with rubber seals at the new M5 bleed port
[2022-06-11T01:38:27] Unknown: The jagwire washers are beautiful actually. They make a perfect seal at the new M6 banjo and M5 bleed port. In the Hope kit they include 2 M6 banjos, 4 M6 washers with rubber seals and 2 M5 washers with rubber seals. Everything needed for the swap. Just need the jagwire lines to go with the quick connect Banjo

[2022-06-11T03:33:55] Unknown: I don't even know what "it" is... But it will fail

[2022-06-11T03:34:38] rosheee: why should it fail xD?

[2022-06-11T03:34:48] rosheee: give me a reason

[2022-06-11T03:35:06] Unknown: Nuff said
[2022-06-11T03:35:19] rosheee: XD also other guys who studied engineering thought it works
[2022-06-11T03:35:26] rosheee: XD idk why it shouldnt
[2022-06-11T03:35:33] rosheee: when u give me a reason then i stfu
[2022-06-11T03:35:57] Unknown: Just look back thru his posts. And please tell me I'm wrong. Dude kills me
[2022-06-11T03:36:24] rosheee: Does more heatpipes mean better cooling? As a general rule, more heatpipes means better cooling. Additional vapor chambers may aid in heat diffusion for some units, but are not as common as traditional heatpipes.
[2022-06-11T03:36:28] Unknown: Lemme try n find one example for you. I will actually waste my time looking because it is that good
[2022-06-11T03:36:38] rosheee: Are heat pipes good for cooling? Heat pipes are the best choice for cooling electronic devices, because depending on the length, the effective thermal conductivity of heat pipes can be up to several thousand times higher than that of a copper rod.
[2022-06-11T03:36:50] rosheee: apor chambers are most often used to spread heat to a local heat sink, whereas heat pipes are generally better for moving heat to a remote sink. Vapor chambers have a very large continuous area, allowing for better isothermalization of the heat sink.
[2022-06-11T03:37:03] Happy Giraffe: You want direct contact
[2022-06-11T03:37:09] rosheee: we have

[2022-06-11T03:39:37] Unknown: Please...
[2022-06-11T03:40:28] rosheee: ok

[2022-06-11T03:42:02] Unknown: Like... C'mon
[2022-06-11T03:44:15] Unknown: Trying to calculate actual rotor heat based off of a formula that takes basically nothing into account. Completely irrelevant even though it sounded so smart. Means nothing
[2022-06-11T03:46:24] Happy Giraffe: Thermal radiation😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
[2022-06-11T03:47:19] rosheee: actually
[2022-06-11T03:47:22] rosheee: he is right XD
[2022-06-11T03:47:29] rosheee: i measured the temp after 80-0
[2022-06-11T03:47:31] rosheee: XD
[2022-06-11T03:47:44] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-06-11T03:47:53] rosheee: OH HATE NOW
[2022-06-11T03:48:09] rosheee: he studied engineering
[2022-06-11T03:48:11] rosheee: and stuff
[2022-06-11T03:48:27] rosheee: we will see :D
[2022-06-11T03:49:25] Happy Giraffe: Only simulator that is accurate is Ebikes.ca motor simulator made by Justin Lemiere, guy is a top professor in this area...
[2022-06-11T03:49:36] rosheee: ok
[2022-06-11T03:49:38] rosheee: let's test it
[2022-06-11T03:49:58] Happy Giraffe: Only has ebike motors but you can input custom motor values also
[2022-06-11T03:50:45] rosheee: XD BUT OMG
[2022-06-11T03:50:55] rosheee: and cuz of that the cooling solution will fail?
[2022-06-11T03:51:08] rosheee: the shit i build is crap for kaabo xD
[2022-06-11T03:54:29] Happy Giraffe: Get a good thermally conducting metal case (maybe 2mm thick), bolt esc to it and done. If you need more put it outside that the distance from mosfet-case-cool air is as little as possible. If case side is built from a heatsink even better.
[2022-06-11T03:54:55] rosheee: the controllers are directly attached to the metalplate
[2022-06-11T03:54:58] rosheee: aluplate
[2022-06-11T03:55:10] Happy Giraffe: Then heatsink gets 60kmh air in that doesnt allow it to warm higher than 40°c I bet.
[2022-06-11T03:55:44] Happy Giraffe: If contact between alu and mosfet is good I see no reason it wouldnt work
[2022-06-11T03:56:06] Happy Giraffe: Tho in closed space it will slowly start to heat up the mass
[2022-06-11T03:56:12] Unknown: Because of that and MANY other pointless conversations just like that
[2022-06-11T03:56:41] Unknown: I hope it works. Just scares me knowing who designed it
[2022-06-11T03:56:47] Happy Giraffe: Hahahhahhahaha
[2022-06-11T03:56:51] rosheee: like i do right now
[2022-06-11T03:56:51] rosheee: heatpipes directly attached to mosfets which spread the heat the whole spacer is out of aluminium
[2022-06-11T03:56:51] rosheee: and vaporchamber even boosts more
[2022-06-11T03:56:55] rosheee: mosfet -> 0.5mm thermalpads -> vapourchamber -> alu/heatspreader
[2022-06-11T03:57:19] rosheee: XD I HAVE 60 degrees when go uphill for 10mn
[2022-06-11T03:57:26] Happy Giraffe: And thermal pad in between mosfet and heatpipe?
[2022-06-11T03:57:27] rosheee: + batterie heats
[2022-06-11T03:57:36] Happy Giraffe: Oh you just typed it
[2022-06-11T03:57:59] rosheee: sry inet here XD
[2022-06-11T03:58:45] rosheee: it's better than attach directly to frame lol
[2022-06-11T03:58:52] rosheee: because that doesnt spread the heat
[2022-06-11T03:58:55] Happy Giraffe: Does heatpipe cover the mosfet completely then?😳 And how will you achieve good mounting pressure?
[2022-06-11T03:59:03] rosheee: VAPOURCHAMBER
[2022-06-11T03:59:18] rosheee: under that is heatpipe
[2022-06-11T03:59:31] rosheee: believe me 😆it makes sense
[2022-06-11T03:59:35] Happy Giraffe: Usually the frame alloys dont conduct heat that well I think, depends
[2022-06-11T03:59:42] rosheee: yes
[2022-06-11T03:59:52] rosheee: and it has even this shit outside
[2022-06-11T04:00:06] rosheee: <photos/photo_4804@11-06-2022_04-00-06.jpg>
[2022-06-11T04:00:11] rosheee: Not that size xD but
[2022-06-11T04:00:15] Happy Giraffe: If it covers whole mosfet area with good mount pressure maybe its not a thermonuclear bomb anymore
[2022-06-11T04:00:19] rosheee: yes
[2022-06-11T04:00:23] rosheee: XD LOL
[2022-06-11T04:00:37] rosheee: i asked a good friend
[2022-06-11T04:00:45] rosheee: also engineer dev. weaponsystems
[2022-06-11T04:00:52] rosheee: and he was like " sounds good" will work
[2022-06-11T04:00:52] rosheee: XD
[2022-06-11T04:00:59] rosheee: my crap is ^^'
[2022-06-11T04:01:01] rosheee: that is lol
[2022-06-11T04:01:11] rosheee: will look complete shit
[2022-06-11T04:01:13] Happy Giraffe: Red is mosfet, blue vesc and yellow case for it. Mount outside and you have best cooling ever😂
[2022-06-11T04:01:26] rosheee: XD
[2022-06-11T04:01:36] Happy Giraffe: Will look like real powrr
[2022-06-11T04:01:40] Happy Giraffe: <animation>
[2022-06-11T04:01:47] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-06-11T04:01:51] rosheee: look
[2022-06-11T04:01:52] rosheee: if it fails
[2022-06-11T04:02:00] rosheee: nah it cant
[2022-06-11T04:02:00] rosheee: XD
[2022-06-11T04:02:05] rosheee: why
[2022-06-11T04:02:16] rosheee: there was nothing against that concept
[2022-06-11T04:02:18] rosheee: only against him
[2022-06-11T04:02:59] rosheee: heatpipes go from front - back
[2022-06-11T04:03:00] rosheee: 30cm
[2022-06-11T04:03:02] rosheee: 3x
[2022-06-11T04:03:12] Unknown: Nothing against the concept but he scares me
[2022-06-11T04:03:14] Happy Giraffe: Long way for heat to travel
[2022-06-11T04:03:19] rosheee: noo
[2022-06-11T04:03:23] rosheee: they transport
[2022-06-11T04:03:27] rosheee: and the vaporchambner
[2022-06-11T04:03:30] rosheee: check what it does
[2022-06-11T04:03:49] Unknown: Seems like a lot of work.
[2022-06-11T04:03:53] rosheee: no
[2022-06-11T04:03:54] rosheee: it is done
[2022-06-11T04:03:55] rosheee: XD
[2022-06-11T04:03:59] Happy Giraffe: Yes I know how the coolers work, my Noctua CPU cooler is exactly same😂
[2022-06-11T04:04:01] rosheee: as soon battery is here
[2022-06-11T04:04:06] rosheee: we give it to a cnc guy
[2022-06-11T04:04:09] rosheee: and he makes that shit
[2022-06-11T04:04:14] Happy Giraffe: But its designed by top engineers in the world😂
[2022-06-11T04:04:37] rosheee: <photos/photo_4806@11-06-2022_04-04-37.jpg>
[2022-06-11T04:04:42] Unknown: <animation>
[2022-06-11T04:04:42] rosheee: why xD
[2022-06-11T04:05:08] Happy Giraffe: But yeah, let's see. Usually bottleneck is mosfet-next surface-then a place to dump the heat
[2022-06-11T04:05:19] rosheee: VAPORCHAMBER
[2022-06-11T04:05:25] rosheee: it transfers directly
[2022-06-11T04:05:29] rosheee: over 30cm
[2022-06-11T04:05:34] rosheee: go and read about it
[2022-06-11T04:05:38] rosheee: then u gonna buy it INSTANT
[2022-06-11T04:05:38] Happy Giraffe: Yes, we will see
[2022-06-11T04:05:45] rosheee: here
[2022-06-11T04:05:46] rosheee: <photos/photo_4807@11-06-2022_04-05-46.jpg>
[2022-06-11T04:05:48] Unknown: Why not just get a more capable controller?
[2022-06-11T04:05:52] Happy Giraffe: I know what they are, in every cooler nowadays
[2022-06-11T04:05:56] rosheee: tronic 250A?
[2022-06-11T04:06:03] rosheee: because no space
[2022-06-11T04:06:06] rosheee: 450A has no space
[2022-06-11T04:06:09] Happy Giraffe: ASI BAC 2000🌚😂
[2022-06-11T04:06:13] rosheee: IT IS G30 XD
[2022-06-11T04:06:15] rosheee: LOOK LOL
[2022-06-11T04:06:23] Unknown: But space for super hypo vapor chamber?
[2022-06-11T04:06:37] rosheee: <photos/photo_4808@11-06-2022_04-06-37.jpg>
[2022-06-11T04:06:43] rosheee: that's the only space left inside frame
[2022-06-11T04:06:49] rosheee: XD
[2022-06-11T04:07:03] Happy Giraffe: If heatpipes would be isolated he could liquid metal it lol
[2022-06-11T04:07:11] rosheee: <photos/photo_4809@11-06-2022_04-07-11.jpg>
[2022-06-11T04:07:16] Happy Giraffe: Tho requires 40-50c to work
[2022-06-11T04:07:33] rosheee: no
[2022-06-11T04:07:38] rosheee: HEATPIPES ARE ISOLATED XD
[2022-06-11T04:07:43] rosheee: or what u mean
[2022-06-11T04:07:49] rosheee: liquid metal between pipes and alu?
[2022-06-11T04:07:56] rosheee: XD? RIP ALU
[2022-06-11T04:20:13] Happy Giraffe: How do you do that?😳
[2022-06-11T04:20:26] rosheee: isolated heatpipes?
[2022-06-11T04:20:30] Happy Giraffe: Yes
[2022-06-11T04:20:54] rosheee: <photos/photo_4810@11-06-2022_04-20-54.jpg>
[2022-06-11T04:21:09] Happy Giraffe: Yeh but electrically isolated lmao
[2022-06-11T04:21:20] rosheee: XD why electrical isolated?
[2022-06-11T04:21:50] rosheee: we push the controller down with springs
[2022-06-11T04:21:58] Happy Giraffe: If you wanted better than thermal pads but anyway, let's see what you come up with
[2022-06-11T04:22:21] rosheee: mosfet -> thermalpad -> vaporchamber ->heatpipes/alu spacer
[2022-06-11T04:22:26] Happy Giraffe: Such fancy😂
[2022-06-11T04:22:30] rosheee: yah xD
[2022-06-11T04:22:36] rosheee: otherwise no engineer
[2022-06-11T04:22:46] rosheee: the shit i build lol
[2022-06-11T04:22:48] rosheee: ^^'
[2022-06-11T04:22:55] rosheee: i hope it works 50%
[2022-06-11T04:23:19] Happy Giraffe: Often engineers job is to troubleshoot, hope you dont have to do much of it🌚
[2022-06-11T04:23:21] Happy Giraffe: Muahaha
[2022-06-11T04:48:37] rosheee: Here lol

[2022-06-11T04:49:18] rosheee: air comes in then goes through vesc and out XD
[2022-06-11T04:49:25] rosheee: icecold
[2022-06-11T04:49:27] rosheee: XD lol
[2022-06-11T04:49:31] rosheee: efficiency 1
[2022-06-11T04:50:59] rosheee: Air in left then stream directly 2 mosfets and then out
[2022-06-11T04:51:02] rosheee: Iq engineer 30ü
[2022-06-11T04:51:04] rosheee: 😂🙈

[2022-06-11T15:08:49] Artem Bulashev: Nearly no stringing with PETG now 😎😎👍
[2022-06-11T15:09:17] Artem Bulashev: Blue is the moves, so lots of potential stringing
[2022-06-11T15:10:10] Artem Bulashev: Yeah love petg but took me 3 weeks and 300€ to get printer to work trustworthy and good enough at 100-150mms
[2022-06-11T15:12:21] Mirono escooters: Petg worth it
[2022-06-11T15:12:40] Mirono escooters: Consider a filament dryer if you dont have it yet :)

[2022-06-11T18:39:36] francois schempers: 600€
[2022-06-11T18:39:40] Mirono escooters: Steal
[2022-06-11T18:40:04] Mirono escooters: Can you just make it electric, or need to approve it. Belgium needs approving but no one does it (government shit) So yes.
[2022-06-11T18:40:11] francois schempers: tire are new, everything else is fine
[2022-06-11T18:40:40] francois schempers: cost 60€ to make it change from thermique to electric
[2022-06-11T18:42:08] francois schempers: I'm gonna empty out the fuel tank and open it so I have all this place to fill with lifepo

[2022-06-11T20:22:29] Paolo ⁭: 12x1.25 or 14x1.5
[2022-06-11T20:22:33] Paolo ⁭: Depends by batch
[2022-06-11T20:42:45] sombre_enfant: Fff i got 12x1.25 😐
[2022-06-11T20:56:51] Artem Bulashev: not that all set a roll should finish in 2 days 🙂 no need for drying 🙂
[2022-06-11T20:57:00] Artem Bulashev: I have it set to print very fast
[2022-06-11T20:57:54] Artem Bulashev: 14mm3 / s max volume speed on infill and some other parts = that is 140mm/s at 0.3mm hight and 0.4mm width
[2022-06-11T21:28:52] Happy Giraffe: Different thread pitch makes no sense lol
[2022-06-11T22:50:03] sombre_enfant: Its actually the standard pitch of m12 and m14 wym ?
[2022-06-11T23:10:45] Happy Giraffe: Isnt 1.25 and 1.5 the pitch or?
[2022-06-11T23:11:15] Happy Giraffe: Maybe I'm mistaken
[2022-06-11T23:12:20] Happy Giraffe: Mine is 12x10
[2022-06-11T23:18:49] sombre_enfant: Nah standard metric aint like that
[2022-06-11T23:19:37] sombre_enfant: M6=1 from that you can learn each of em
[2022-06-11T23:48:40] Paolo ⁭: @SibClimb what about achilleus frame?
[2022-06-11T23:50:36] rosheee: XD
[2022-06-11T23:51:37] sombre_enfant: Bad frame still we sold one 2 week ago now client wanna sell it in depot and get a bronco, because folding hook has play, but it got too much clearence to the ground but its bigger than the blade frame if u wanna do big battery kinda same as thunder...
[2022-06-11T23:51:47] sombre_enfant: G30 on top
[2022-06-11T23:52:05] rosheee: what what awhwat?
[2022-06-11T23:53:07] Paolo ⁭: Is better or worse than thunder?
[2022-06-11T23:53:16] sombre_enfant: Le shit wobble bc unexperienced user and il though que un bronco c'est mieux but geometry still same
[2022-06-11T23:53:37] sombre_enfant: From stock ? I'll say worse than a thunder 2
[2022-06-11T23:54:23] Paolo ⁭: I just talk about frame
[2022-06-11T23:54:31] Paolo ⁭: Other components will be removed all
[2022-06-11T23:54:46] Paolo ⁭: Battery motors and controller I ll sell
[2022-06-11T23:55:36] Paolo ⁭: If is similar to thunder 1 frame then I like it
[2022-06-11T23:55:45] sombre_enfant: I never had both frame together but im pretty sure its the same size
[2022-06-11T23:56:08] Paolo ⁭: But what about hinge quality? Will it broke?
[2022-06-11T23:56:41] Happy Giraffe: I wonder what the 1.25 and 1.5 then stands for
[2022-06-11T23:56:45] sombre_enfant: If you totally tighten it so you cant even fold it it wont
[2022-06-11T23:57:42] Paolo ⁭: Tighten what? The folding system?
[2022-06-11T23:58:11] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_4823@11-06-2022_23-58-11.jpg>
[2022-06-11T23:58:11] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_4824@11-06-2022_23-58-11.jpg>
[2022-06-11T23:58:16] Paolo ⁭: I just don’t want happen this
[2022-06-11T23:59:02] sombre_enfant: Its the thread size différence between hole Like m6x1 (classic) u drill 5mm cuz 6-1 Or like m5x0.8 u drill at 4.2 M3x0.5 u drill at 2.5 U get it ?
[2022-06-11T23:59:29] sombre_enfant: Yeah
[2022-06-11T23:59:42] Paolo ⁭: Yes I will never fold it
[2022-06-11T23:59:49] Paolo ⁭: This is no problem
[2022-06-12T00:00:22] sombre_enfant: If u stand right on a scooter and know how to ride it without pulling all your weight it wont ig u does
[2022-06-12T00:04:34] Paolo ⁭: Yes but I just want know if quality is better or worse than Speedtrott
[2022-06-12T00:05:08] Paolo ⁭: I ride 4 years already my blade with 14000km and never frame problem
[2022-06-12T00:06:01] Кирилл: thread pitch
[2022-06-12T00:07:12] sombre_enfant: Better than speedtrott
[2022-06-12T00:07:49] Paolo ⁭: I’ve never seen Speedtrott hinge broke
[2022-06-12T00:08:00] Paolo ⁭: I’ve the oldest version
[2022-06-12T00:08:23] sombre_enfant: Btw wich motor are in those speedtrott they looking smaller than 50mm outside
[2022-06-12T00:08:33] sombre_enfant: Those broke
[2022-06-12T00:08:46] Paolo ⁭: 40mm hm

[2022-06-12T00:14:38] Happy Giraffe: But thats what I asked first🌚
[2022-06-12T00:14:41] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-06-12T00:16:28] Happy Giraffe: Too late for my brain to work
[2022-06-12T01:25:09] Unknown: @Happy_Giraffe those Kool stop sintered pads on the MT5s are insane. Honestly couldn't imagine a nicer feeling set of brakes. Things grab like crazy crazy. Magura MDR -C rotors are super beefy and seem to be working nicely with the calipers and pads
[2022-06-12T01:30:23] Face de Pin Sucé: Good I think
[2022-06-12T01:36:25] Happy Giraffe: Told ya😂🌚
[2022-06-12T01:37:42] rosheee: Lol
[2022-06-12T01:37:44] rosheee: I told ya
[2022-06-12T01:37:45] rosheee: Bitchasses
[2022-06-12T01:37:53] Happy Giraffe: <animation>
[2022-06-12T01:38:02] rosheee: IT WAS MY IDEA
[2022-06-12T01:38:11] rosheee: I sm the only one in the world
[2022-06-12T01:38:12] rosheee: 1st
[2022-06-12T01:38:14] Happy Giraffe: You were my and your moms idea
[2022-06-12T01:38:14] rosheee: 😂😂
[2022-06-12T01:38:32] rosheee: My mom is dead
[2022-06-12T01:38:53] Happy Giraffe: Sry didnt mean to be that tough on her
[2022-06-12T01:39:20] Happy Giraffe: Anyway, gonna soon find out Shimano cheap hydro vs dual mechanical🌚
[2022-06-12T01:39:36] rosheee: Do it
[2022-06-12T01:41:32] Happy Giraffe: In two weeks I go back to finland and buy the bike to start modding on
[2022-06-12T01:41:46] Happy Giraffe: Cube Aim Ex Im thinking
[2022-06-12T01:42:28] rosheee: I told u
[2022-06-12T01:42:30] Unknown: Yea no joke Magura dual caliper and Kool stop sintered combo is winner winner chicken dinner. Thank you all for the suggestion on the pads
[2022-06-12T01:42:50] rosheee: Wait until u used them couple days
[2022-06-12T01:42:53] rosheee: 😂😂
[2022-06-12T01:43:06] rosheee: Adam Adam u use 10awg for motors?
[2022-06-12T01:43:34] rosheee: Ah and btw adam and happy For even more bite Use reinforced fuckeria hose
[2022-06-12T01:44:38] Unknown: The jagwire lines I think are a slight upgrade over the stock Magura lines, levers feel solid n smooth
[2022-06-12T01:44:52] Unknown: I'm using 11awg from the l1019 cable
[2022-06-12T01:44:54] rosheee: yah not when oil gets warm
[2022-06-12T01:44:55] rosheee: ok
[2022-06-12T01:45:00] Happy Giraffe: More bite not needed😂
[2022-06-12T01:45:02] rosheee: cuz i have 10awg here XD
[2022-06-12T01:45:06] rosheee: always
[2022-06-12T01:45:19] Happy Giraffe: Not for my speeds and 203mm discs
[2022-06-12T01:45:24] rosheee: ok
[2022-06-12T01:45:25] rosheee: that's fuckeria
[2022-06-12T01:45:30] rosheee: 203 and that setup
[2022-06-12T01:45:38] Unknown: I was doing a 2nd bleed and forgot the brake blocks... Piston popped right out of the caliper 🤦🏻🤦🏻🤦🏻 Luckily popped right back in lol
[2022-06-12T01:46:06] Unknown: I shat my panties
[2022-06-12T01:46:09] Happy Giraffe: Atleast the pistons on Magura move, on Zoom shits it corrodes into place
[2022-06-12T01:46:18] Unknown: All is fine tho thank god
[2022-06-12T01:46:22] rosheee: XD worst
[2022-06-12T01:46:31] Unknown: They do, seem really smooth
[2022-06-12T01:46:37] Unknown: And they're removable!! Haha
[2022-06-12T01:46:41] rosheee: but adam 😆
[2022-06-12T01:46:46] rosheee: u told me about hope kit
[2022-06-12T01:46:50] rosheee: i thought u alrdy got it
[2022-06-12T01:46:54] rosheee: months ago
[2022-06-12T01:47:03] rosheee: 6months
[2022-06-12T01:47:04] Unknown: Yes.. no I didn't. I just got it
[2022-06-12T01:47:11] Unknown: Noo... Just had read about it
[2022-06-12T01:47:13] rosheee: hmm
[2022-06-12T01:47:51] Unknown: It works great tho. All pieces needed in hope kit besides M6 x 20mm banjo bolt. Plus need 2 jagwire lines with the quick connect ends
[2022-06-12T01:48:43] Unknown: <photos/photo_4829@12-06-2022_01-48-43.jpg>
[2022-06-12T01:48:44] Unknown: <photos/photo_4830@12-06-2022_01-48-44.jpg>
[2022-06-12T01:50:59] Unknown: <photos/photo_4831@12-06-2022_01-50-59.jpg>
[2022-06-12T01:52:23] Unknown: Hope kit comes with these washers, 4 M6 and 2 M5. Work great. 1 hope kit is enough for both brakes. Then need the M6 x 20mm banjo bolt/screw plus 2 PCs of jagwire lines. Nutt brake bleed adapter is M5, so my old bleed adapter works on the new M5 bleed port
[2022-06-12T01:54:55] Unknown: Pads make perfect contact. About 95% contact at least. Very top may have about 1mm of non contact area, maybe less
[2022-06-12T01:54:55] Unknown: <photos/photo_4833@12-06-2022_01-54-55.jpg>

[2022-06-12T01:55:11] rosheee: i fucked 11kw dualtron today gained +1mm
[2022-06-12T01:55:17] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-06-12T01:56:23] rosheee: noiis
[2022-06-12T01:57:21] rosheee: are these the original adapter screws?
[2022-06-12T02:00:24] Unknown: The pad holder screws?
[2022-06-12T02:00:28] rosheee: no
[2022-06-12T02:00:31] rosheee: caliper mount
[2022-06-12T02:00:38] rosheee: that u made them by urself u mentioned
[2022-06-12T02:00:41] rosheee: funny fact is ^^'
[2022-06-12T02:00:49] rosheee: my friend bought mt5 as well
[2022-06-12T02:00:57] rosheee: and had the titan screws init
[2022-06-12T02:03:31] Unknown: So strange they didn't come with the pad screws lol. Oh caliper mount is from zero 11x and the mount screws are just random
[2022-06-12T02:03:48] Unknown: Yea the Magura green pads are but I think those wear out quick
[2022-06-12T02:04:13] Unknown: My MT5 HC came with 1 piece green performance pads
[2022-06-12T02:05:01] Happy Giraffe: Resin pads geh
[2022-06-12T02:05:47] Happy Giraffe: That serves some purpose we don't know about
[2022-06-12T02:17:25] Unknown: The rotors are 2mm Magura. They seem just fine to me 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-06-12T02:17:44] rosheee: my friend today has it
[2022-06-12T02:17:57] Unknown: I have the hc1 lever which is identical shape and size to hc3, just no bite point adjustment
[2022-06-12T02:18:07] rosheee: after he tested my mt7pro levers with mt7 front mt8 sl rear he was like wtf
[2022-06-12T02:18:21] rosheee: even after touched my original kaabo brakes x mt8 pro levers ^^'
[2022-06-12T02:18:31] rosheee: used as well
[2022-06-12T02:18:42] Unknown: <photos/photo_4836@12-06-2022_02-18-42.jpg>
[2022-06-12T02:18:43] Unknown: <photos/photo_4837@12-06-2022_02-18-43.jpg>
[2022-06-12T02:18:53] rosheee: idk have to ask him tomorrow
[2022-06-12T02:18:59] Unknown: Yes because of the bite point adjustment (in addition to the reach adjustment)
[2022-06-12T02:19:15] Unknown: I believe hc3 has bite point adjust
[2022-06-12T02:19:23] Unknown: Almost positive
[2022-06-12T02:19:31] rosheee: how u adjust bite xD?
[2022-06-12T02:20:16] rosheee: trickstuff > magura ^^'
[2022-06-12T02:20:17] Unknown: There is a second knob on the lever. Reach adjust on mt7 is by knob, not hex tool. Also mt7 has bite point adjustment on the knob. So basically no tools needed for adjustment
[2022-06-12T02:20:30] rosheee: i have it fully outside
[2022-06-12T02:20:33] rosheee: inside is crap
[2022-06-12T02:20:50] Unknown: Super beefy made specifically for ebikes high speed and high weight. Tons of metal for heat dissipation
[2022-06-12T02:22:57] rosheee: yes but what metal ^^
[2022-06-12T02:23:04] rosheee: there are different mixtures
[2022-06-12T02:23:41] rosheee: i tested 2 different magura discs last dec. and they sucked then shimano also crap and then trickstuff
[2022-06-12T02:23:44] rosheee: heavy duty
[2022-06-12T02:23:48] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-06-12T02:26:55] Bumble: <photos/photo_4839@12-06-2022_02-26-55.jpg>
[2022-06-12T02:28:19] rosheee: idk spend enough on brakes atm
[2022-06-12T02:28:41] rosheee: maybe next project but need bigger rotors
[2022-06-12T02:28:49] rosheee: ordered super72 last night omg
[2022-06-12T02:30:06] rosheee: depends on use
[2022-06-12T02:30:19] rosheee: i just bought because prestige 😆and they looked best
[2022-06-12T02:30:36] rosheee: but when go 2 racetrack i maybe see the difference
[2022-06-12T02:31:01] rosheee: i was twice at boiling point and 2x disc bend (shimano)
[2022-06-12T02:31:18] rosheee: the mt8 overheats faster (2 piston) as the mt7
[2022-06-12T02:31:47] rosheee: but then when u got the oil boiling the brakeline/hose extend
[2022-06-12T02:32:06] rosheee: and IDK if bike brakes withstand such high temps. and pressure
[2022-06-12T02:32:11] rosheee: caused by the oil
[2022-06-12T02:32:33] rosheee: so gonna use steelflex brakehose in track that i'm safe ^^'
[2022-06-12T02:32:51] rosheee: at 100% lever cycle i had 0 brake power..rly 0
[2022-06-12T02:32:55] rosheee: like there is air inside
[2022-06-12T02:33:20] rosheee: happens at 350-450 degrees
[2022-06-12T02:33:46] rosheee: lol ^^' on racecar this isn't even working temp.
[2022-06-12T02:35:56] rosheee: but u feel the difference when using mt7 front + rear or 4 piston
[2022-06-12T02:36:23] rosheee: compared to mt7 front and mt8 rear 4-2 piston
[2022-06-12T02:37:13] rosheee: on scooters 30kg or more i think mt8 / 2 pistons isn't safe when going fast and generate lot of heat
[2022-06-12T02:37:28] rosheee: and btw the green magura pads Adam doesn't have a copper plate
[2022-06-12T02:37:57] rosheee: maybe they bite good and feel good but heat dissipation isn't the same
[2022-06-12T02:38:16] rosheee: and when u wanna go max retard u can design a airduct that rams the air directly to the pads
[2022-06-12T02:38:31] rosheee: like on motorbikes or racecars / powerfull streetcars
[2022-06-12T03:03:21] Unknown: Yeah?!
[2022-06-12T03:11:26] rosheee: ofc
[2022-06-12T03:43:16] Unknown: Awesome sauce
[2022-06-12T03:43:29] rosheee: yah wanna taste it as well
[2022-06-12T03:43:42] rosheee: apollo sauce is nice
[2022-06-12T03:44:59] Unknown: LoL. What color did you get?
[2022-06-12T03:45:09] rosheee: idk
[2022-06-12T03:45:11] rosheee: we will see
[2022-06-12T03:45:18] Unknown: Oh cool surprise surprise
[2022-06-12T03:45:22] rosheee: are there different ones?
[2022-06-12T03:45:38] Unknown: Umm... I know 11+ has 3 color schemes but not sure about super72
[2022-06-12T03:45:42] Unknown: Hmmm
[2022-06-12T03:46:10] Unknown: <photos/photo_4840@12-06-2022_03-46-10.jpg>
[2022-06-12T03:46:29] Unknown: I'm not sure if those are all super72, 11+ or a mix
[2022-06-12T03:47:30] Unknown: The superman colors are sort of cool but can get old fast.. I know that was 11+. The grey is awesome and the yellow is... Vsett yellow
[2022-06-12T03:47:56] rosheee: Right one would be epic fail
[2022-06-12T03:48:03] rosheee: Left or mid
[2022-06-12T03:48:03] Unknown: Yes it has been lol
[2022-06-12T03:48:09] Unknown: Yup. Agreed
[2022-06-12T03:49:00] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-06-12T03:49:08] Unknown: Vsett yellow really isn't bad. Looks sharp against the black. But I would prefer grey. This winter I'll paint my 10+ , no more yellow. Not sure what color to go. Black n white is cool
[2022-06-12T03:49:39] Unknown: I hope it works. There is room for that in the deck?
[2022-06-12T03:50:24] rosheee: yah put badass kelly in it + max battery
[2022-06-12T03:51:04] rosheee: 😆my additional hyperaircoolingsolution helps keeping these tronics cooler
[2022-06-12T03:51:06] Unknown: Also, what motors? My 10+ motors are seeing some heat even statorade at 80a batt 225a phase. Really want those damn motor coolers, ugh.
[2022-06-12T03:51:16] rosheee: dude
[2022-06-12T03:51:18] rosheee: please tell me
[2022-06-12T03:51:30] rosheee: ur wheels should be spinning at 40mph
[2022-06-12T03:51:44] Unknown: ? Not following
[2022-06-12T03:51:52] rosheee: u use 80A battery and 225 phase
[2022-06-12T03:52:00] Unknown: On 20s
[2022-06-12T03:52:02] rosheee: u have no spinning wheels ?
[2022-06-12T03:52:06] rosheee: at 40mph?
[2022-06-12T03:52:09] Unknown: Oh oh... Spinning
[2022-06-12T03:52:10] Unknown: Lol
[2022-06-12T03:52:47] Unknown: Yes, front wheel chirps at 30 to full throttle. But... Rear motor is 80/225 and front is 70/135
[2022-06-12T03:52:56] Unknown: So front is less power
[2022-06-12T03:53:08] rosheee: i use 70/135 rear 55/135 front
[2022-06-12T03:53:09] Unknown: Or else I would die. Front tire would lose traction always
[2022-06-12T03:53:27] rosheee: and i have spinning wheel front even putting all my weight to front until 20mph
[2022-06-12T03:53:40] rosheee: 20-25mph
[2022-06-12T03:54:12] rosheee: but fucked dualtron with 80A/180A rear 70A/150A front
[2022-06-12T03:54:30] rosheee: ur scooter is +15-20kg more
[2022-06-12T03:54:52] Unknown: I do lean weight forward a lot.. but it's controllable with 80/225 and 70/135. Definitely have to have some speed going to punch full throttle tho.
[2022-06-12T03:55:09] Unknown: I have super stiff suspension which helps a lot
[2022-06-12T03:55:26] Unknown: That was with tronic?
[2022-06-12T03:55:29] rosheee: with the 6 phase zero motors i needed 40mph to get full traction
[2022-06-12T03:55:36] rosheee: no ubox v1
[2022-06-12T03:55:39] rosheee: 16S5p
[2022-06-12T03:55:43] rosheee: he has max 11kw
[2022-06-12T03:55:43] Unknown: Damn, those things are beast
[2022-06-12T03:55:53] Unknown: Oh gotcha..
[2022-06-12T03:56:11] rosheee: vsett motors have more boost 0-50mph than dualtron
[2022-06-12T03:56:18] rosheee: at 55mph he catched me
[2022-06-12T03:56:38] rosheee: he has spinning wheels until 40mph
[2022-06-12T03:56:45] Unknown: Vsett motors are actually super fast on 20s... Thing pulls like crazy
[2022-06-12T03:56:50] Unknown: I believe it
[2022-06-12T03:56:52] rosheee: yah even on 16S
[2022-06-12T03:56:58] rosheee: but i don't have heat problems
[2022-06-12T03:57:02] Unknown: Yup... Motors are great
[2022-06-12T03:57:10] rosheee: not even reach 80 degrees
[2022-06-12T03:57:21] rosheee: the other thing is ^^
[2022-06-12T03:57:24] rosheee: your cables are longer than mine
[2022-06-12T03:57:34] rosheee: so u push more amps but loose cuz cables
[2022-06-12T03:57:37] Unknown: I don't either really... Hottest day so far was 85F ambient. Those setting rear motor hit 175F at the windings...
[2022-06-12T03:58:06] rosheee: ok
[2022-06-12T03:58:07] Unknown: But I can see a really hot day, pushing them hard... They will get above 200F I think
[2022-06-12T03:58:15] rosheee: we had 85F yesteday
[2022-06-12T03:58:33] rosheee: just letting scooter chilling in sun pushed the temp without riding to 104F
[2022-06-12T03:58:43] rosheee: XD
[2022-06-12T03:58:46] Unknown: 175F = 80C at the windings
[2022-06-12T03:59:00] Unknown: Damn, that's warm
[2022-06-12T03:59:08] Unknown: Black sealed motors. Hold heat
[2022-06-12T03:59:24] rosheee: 😆i sprayed them
[2022-06-12T03:59:37] rosheee: outside temp of motor 95-100F max
[2022-06-12T03:59:55] rosheee: dualtron motor without ferro (now added some) 140F
[2022-06-12T04:00:24] rosheee: <files/2022-06-11_19-07-06.csv>
[2022-06-12T04:00:24] Unknown: Not bad at all. 175F at the windings, covers were pretty warm to the touch... Like can put fingers on for 3-4 seconds before was too hot
[2022-06-12T04:00:25] rosheee: <files/2022-06-11_00-29-30.csv>
[2022-06-12T04:00:34] rosheee: rofl
[2022-06-12T04:00:36] rosheee: XD WTF
[2022-06-12T04:00:56] rosheee: u have pic where u put temp. sensor in motor?
[2022-06-12T04:01:00] Unknown: Maybe not quite that hot on the covers lol
[2022-06-12T04:01:04] Unknown: Yeah
[2022-06-12T04:01:23] rosheee: but u should be spinning all time with these amps
[2022-06-12T04:01:32] Unknown: <photos/photo_4567@31-05-2022_16-53-06.jpg>
[2022-06-12T04:01:33] Unknown: <photos/photo_4565@31-05-2022_16-53-05.jpg>
[2022-06-12T04:01:36] rosheee: i can't hold steering when tested with 17S at 180A
[2022-06-12T04:01:43] rosheee: ah pervert
[2022-06-12T04:01:46] Unknown: Directly on the windings
[2022-06-12T04:01:52] Unknown: Lol
[2022-06-12T04:02:00] rosheee: rly
[2022-06-12T04:02:13] rosheee: i put more power to the rear now
[2022-06-12T04:02:26] rosheee: before i had 60/60 battery front/rear
[2022-06-12T04:02:37] rosheee: and 135A front rear
[2022-06-12T04:02:39] rosheee: no prob
[2022-06-12T04:02:46] rosheee: but with 70A rear and 55 front ^^'
[2022-06-12T04:03:04] rosheee: don't wanna imagine with 20S then
[2022-06-12T04:03:27] Unknown: I have to be careful with the throttle on those settings. My typical riding settings (mode 2) are 75a batt /195a phase rear and 70a batt /125a phase front.
[2022-06-12T04:03:30] rosheee: i even had spinning wheels with kaabo until 40mph with slicks 105 front 110 rear with low pressure
[2022-06-12T04:03:44] rosheee: what pressure u run?
[2022-06-12T04:03:52] Unknown: Hmm... Maybe Vsett 10 has super traction lol
[2022-06-12T04:04:01] rosheee: or what pressure u have when motors are warm?
[2022-06-12T04:04:05] Unknown: 40 psi with tubes. PMT E-Fire
[2022-06-12T04:04:21] rosheee: how heavy is vsett stock?
[2022-06-12T04:04:21] Unknown: Around 50-52 when HOT
[2022-06-12T04:04:25] rosheee: lol
[2022-06-12T04:04:29] Unknown: I forget lol
[2022-06-12T04:04:35] rosheee: 40kg
[2022-06-12T04:04:47] Unknown: 86lbs
[2022-06-12T04:04:57] Unknown: Mine is probably closer to 100 lbs
[2022-06-12T04:05:00] rosheee: lol
[2022-06-12T04:05:12] Unknown: Actually, I know it is
[2022-06-12T04:05:24] rosheee: my g30 is 20kg
[2022-06-12T04:05:33] Unknown: OMG lol
[2022-06-12T04:05:39] rosheee: 40lbs
[2022-06-12T04:05:50] rosheee: at the moment XD
[2022-06-12T04:05:57] Unknown: Crazy. Like Vsett 5 😝
[2022-06-12T04:06:05] rosheee: with 20S maybe 50lbs
[2022-06-12T04:06:19] Unknown: Still.. half of mine
[2022-06-12T04:06:32] rosheee: yep and 9kw nearly 10kw peak atm
[2022-06-12T04:06:34] Unknown: Maybe why so fast
[2022-06-12T04:06:36] rosheee: that's why spinning
[2022-06-12T04:06:41] rosheee: why xD?
[2022-06-12T04:06:43] rosheee: same motors
[2022-06-12T04:06:48] rosheee: 17S
[2022-06-12T04:06:49] Unknown: Yup... Weight has a lot to do with traction
[2022-06-12T04:06:58] rosheee: or back then when i had 17S
[2022-06-12T04:07:01] rosheee: the motors had high kv
[2022-06-12T04:08:26] rosheee: but on super72 i gonna put in max sized battery 2x paolo motors 2x kelly 7230 (paolo said) (the one for 500$ each i saw dunno if they are the 7230) max thicc slicks front rear stiff suspension and take out or reduce weight as much as possible
[2022-06-12T04:09:02] rosheee: or maybe ask UU motors for the 14KW motors
[2022-06-12T04:09:10] rosheee: with 150nm 😆or 300nm each
[2022-06-12T04:09:23] rosheee: about the real specs
[2022-06-12T04:09:36] rosheee: AND FOR YOU EXTRA ADAM
[2022-06-12T04:09:41] rosheee: i gonna learn how to build battery
[2022-06-12T04:12:00] rosheee: and btw
[2022-06-12T04:12:07] rosheee: today i reached 104 kmh with 16S
[2022-06-12T04:12:36] rosheee: <photos/photo_4843@12-06-2022_04-12-36.jpg>
[2022-06-12T04:13:11] rosheee: BUT FUCKING FIELD WEAKENING XD
[2022-06-12T04:13:27] rosheee: i turn it off it pushed the temp. so aggressive
[2022-06-12T04:13:35] Unknown: Dude I think the super72 is going to be a beast frame to build on. If 10+ is anything to go by, super72 is going to be monster
[2022-06-12T04:13:49] rosheee: yah the thing is
[2022-06-12T04:13:56] Unknown: 64mph... That is moving
[2022-06-12T04:14:07] rosheee: i hope the steering geometry is better
[2022-06-12T04:14:11] Unknown: That's actually 1mph less than my max balls of steel speed so far
[2022-06-12T04:14:14] rosheee: that i don't have to use steering damper
[2022-06-12T04:14:31] rosheee: 114kmh with kaabo
[2022-06-12T04:14:36] rosheee: but it's no prob
[2022-06-12T04:14:36] Unknown: Yea.. I don't know how geometry is with fork shocks
[2022-06-12T04:14:50] rosheee: steering damper only needed when geometry is fucked up
[2022-06-12T04:14:53] Unknown: Is better than swingarms? Like 10+?
[2022-06-12T04:15:00] rosheee: idk
[2022-06-12T04:15:10] Unknown: I've never riding a scooter like wolf with fork shocks
[2022-06-12T04:15:12] rosheee: but at 107kmh with g30 it didn't wobble
[2022-06-12T04:15:23] rosheee: when u hold steering like a gaybitch u get wobble
[2022-06-12T04:15:33] rosheee: also because suspension is sooo soft omg
[2022-06-12T04:15:34] Unknown: Truth
[2022-06-12T04:15:50] rosheee: when u hold it like real men/woman it wobbles less
[2022-06-12T04:15:52] Unknown: My shocks have 1800lb spring on front and 2000lb spring on rear shock
[2022-06-12T04:16:02] rosheee: i can't even change that on kaabo XD
[2022-06-12T04:16:10] Unknown: Yes... But I also have damper. Can ride 50mph with 1 hand 😜
[2022-06-12T04:16:18] Unknown: I know
[2022-06-12T04:16:21] rosheee: lol
[2022-06-12T04:16:40] rosheee: i have 1 damper on g30 😆 BUT i had exa as well on the 17s
[2022-06-12T04:16:58] rosheee: the more the spring had to work the less stability i had but that's normal
[2022-06-12T04:17:23] rosheee: dunno like soft springs not for scooters neither cars or anything
[2022-06-12T04:17:26] Unknown: For sure
[2022-06-12T04:17:37] rosheee: but why don't u buy a
[2022-06-12T04:17:38] Unknown: Nahh.. soft springs are shit for stability and speed
[2022-06-12T04:17:48] rosheee: i BET ur vsett would profit of it
[2022-06-12T04:17:51] rosheee: second
[2022-06-12T04:18:18] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-06-12T04:18:50] rosheee: when activated = suspension unlocked otherwise locked XD
[2022-06-12T04:19:35] Unknown: Super nice... Had that lockout on my air shocks but hated them
[2022-06-12T04:19:37] rosheee: 16S fuckeria
[2022-06-12T04:19:41] rosheee: wtf over 10kw
[2022-06-12T04:19:59] rosheee: i used 150lbs spring on g30 btw xD
[2022-06-12T04:20:13] rosheee: when i entered vsett chat and ppl talked about 1500 and more i was like WHUAT?!
[2022-06-12T04:20:21] Unknown: That's crazy. Like I said my 10+ has pushed 12kw (it is capable of much more in short bursts). That is a lot of power
[2022-06-12T04:20:33] rosheee: your should go more
[2022-06-12T04:20:34] Unknown: Haha... Different geometry
[2022-06-12T04:20:43] Unknown: Oh it will... No question
[2022-06-12T04:20:43] rosheee: but i think u reached the max of power with the motors
[2022-06-12T04:20:49] Unknown: Close
[2022-06-12T04:20:51] rosheee: when they reach that high temp
[2022-06-12T04:20:56] rosheee: what u think is possible with themP
[2022-06-12T04:20:58] Unknown: Yes. Exactly
[2022-06-12T04:21:00] rosheee: 14kw?
[2022-06-12T04:21:15] rosheee: with 20S and 2x90A battery
[2022-06-12T04:21:23] Unknown: Probably close to that on a speed run but not sustainable due to heat
[2022-06-12T04:21:27] Unknown: Yes
[2022-06-12T04:21:50] Unknown: I would push to 100C at windings
[2022-06-12T04:21:59] rosheee: hmm i try 250A phase / 280A max current / 90A battery front + rear
[2022-06-12T04:22:03] Unknown: I bet 14ke is possible
[2022-06-12T04:22:09] rosheee: but with temp. sensor on rear motor
[2022-06-12T04:22:22] rosheee: i have spare motors ^^ so doesn't matter
[2022-06-12T04:22:33] rosheee: and with gear on not that idie
[2022-06-12T04:22:40] Unknown: Temp sensors are a must I think if pushing. Can set max temp and power reduces if reached... So motors stay safe
[2022-06-12T04:23:07] Unknown: Motors stay safe while 100% fuckeria 🤣
[2022-06-12T04:24:05] rosheee: so far i had no problems but only at
[2022-06-12T04:24:17] rosheee: maybe inside it was like 120C 😆
[2022-06-12T04:25:27] Unknown: Hah, yea 120c or anything like that is getting close to fireworks motors. Actually 120C at the windings shouldn't harm most laminations or magnets... Not much more tho
[2022-06-12T04:25:37] rosheee: but why outside not even 40C
[2022-06-12T04:25:43] rosheee: i add more fluid xD
[2022-06-12T04:25:47] Unknown: Heat is crazy like that
[2022-06-12T04:26:01] Unknown: Design of motor 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-06-12T04:26:10] rosheee: and please
[2022-06-12T04:26:15] rosheee: XD MAYBE U'RE ABLE TO TELL ME
[2022-06-12T04:26:20] rosheee: how connect heat sensor
[2022-06-12T04:26:26] rosheee: 1 of the 2 lines to -?
[2022-06-12T04:26:29] rosheee: and the other to temp
[2022-06-12T04:29:31] Unknown: Temp sensor... NTC 10k or 100k (100k good for VESC) B:3950 No polarity, wire order does not matter. Hook 1 wire to hall ground. Other to temp sensor wire to VESC
[2022-06-12T04:29:35] Unknown: Super simple
[2022-06-12T04:29:44] rosheee: i have one
[2022-06-12T04:29:48] rosheee: ah ok
[2022-06-12T04:29:52] rosheee: ground and temo
[2022-06-12T04:29:55] rosheee: temp
[2022-06-12T04:29:56] rosheee: thx
[2022-06-12T04:29:58] Unknown: Very easy. Hardest part is running the extra wire
[2022-06-12T04:30:30] Unknown: Use hall ground for one wire.... Other wire goes to VESC temp sensor input. That's it
[2022-06-12T04:30:31] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-06-12T04:30:41] rosheee: I put 10awg in now
[2022-06-12T04:31:38] Unknown: Yup... Hardest part is running that extra temp sensor wire out of the motor/axle. That's why I used Higo l1019 cable... 3X 11awg phase wires and 8 sensor wires.. for halls and temp sensor
[2022-06-12T04:32:21] Unknown: L1019 cable... Halls with temp sensor, still 1 wire is unused
[2022-06-12T04:34:02] rosheee: And hall from original cable
[2022-06-12T04:36:14] Unknown: Yea unfortunately no extra wire for temp sensor... Seriously wiring is easy... Running that 1 extra wire can be tricky
[2022-06-12T04:36:58] rosheee: omfg
[2022-06-12T04:37:04] rosheee: why that fucking bearing doesn't come off
[2022-06-12T04:37:24] Unknown: Stuck on the axle... Bearing puller is nice to have
[2022-06-12T04:37:41] rosheee: on all other motors it came off
[2022-06-12T04:37:44] rosheee: omg
[2022-06-12T04:37:58] Unknown: <photos/photo_4846@12-06-2022_04-37-58.jpg>
[2022-06-12T04:38:01] rosheee: yah i was a super retard when had these motors
[2022-06-12T04:38:06] Unknown: That's what I use. Works perfect
[2022-06-12T04:38:06] rosheee: look what I'VE DONE
[2022-06-12T04:38:08] rosheee: i blame myself
[2022-06-12T04:38:31] rosheee: i cutted teh shit XD
[2022-06-12T04:38:34] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-06-12T04:38:55] Unknown: Not following. What did you cut?

[2022-06-12T04:39:02] rosheee: XD U CANT SEE?
[2022-06-12T04:39:05] rosheee: the axle stem

[2022-06-12T04:39:46] Unknown: But bearing should slide over wire no problem
[2022-06-12T04:40:02] Unknown: Can you get it off the axle?
[2022-06-12T04:40:12] Unknown: Like get it started coming off
[2022-06-12T04:43:29] rosheee: how 😆
[2022-06-12T04:43:32] rosheee: i can't move it
[2022-06-12T04:44:35] rosheee: u're the vsett masterblaster :D
[2022-06-12T04:44:52] rosheee: how can i take it off? use superglue and glue it to motorbody?
[2022-06-12T04:45:41] Unknown: Bearing puller bro

[2022-06-12T11:03:14] Mirono escooters: 380msg good morning sunshines
[2022-06-12T11:03:46] Mirono escooters: Yesterday i added ferrofluid wonder how much diff ill see
[2022-06-12T11:19:12] francois schempers: the motor will feel warmer to the touch, but that's good, that means it's working sending heat outside
[2022-06-12T11:19:28] Mirono escooters: Indeed. I got a temp sensor inside too
[2022-06-12T11:19:46] Mirono escooters: With 200a phase i need every cooling i can get haha
[2022-06-12T11:23:09] Konstantin: And before/after , it's work well?
[2022-06-12T11:26:01] Mirono escooters: Didnt test ride yet haha
[2022-06-12T11:36:33] Gigolo Joe: Depends on how much u added
[2022-06-12T11:40:23] Mirono escooters: A full bottle, haha
[2022-06-12T11:40:41] Mirono escooters: I couldnt see how much as the axle was still in, but it was alot
[2022-06-12T11:40:46] Mirono escooters: Or it looked like alot
[2022-06-12T11:41:10] Mirono escooters: Surely must do something 😂
[2022-06-12T11:41:26] Gigolo Joe: Breh
[2022-06-12T11:41:40] Gigolo Joe: U need like 5mil for a scooter motor
[2022-06-12T11:41:52] Mirono escooters: Ebike
[2022-06-12T11:42:23] Gigolo Joe: Oh that's a different story
[2022-06-12T11:42:44] Mirono escooters: :)
[2022-06-12T11:42:53] Mirono escooters: Think i did approx 12ml
[2022-06-12T11:43:18] Mirono escooters: Satisfying seeing magnet suck it in haha
[2022-06-12T15:12:02] Happy Giraffe: Put some extra shrink (what I had on hand was bit too big as the ends don't sit flat) on Alberts battery as he likes to have balance wires only covered by shrink lol
[2022-06-12T15:12:32] Happy Giraffe: Should survive transport better now
[2022-06-12T15:12:52] Mirono escooters: Hmm atleast do 2 layer wrap (not you,but albert)
[2022-06-12T15:13:07] Happy Giraffe: Also what Denis uses is much thicker shrink than Albert
[2022-06-12T15:13:30] Happy Giraffe: Some shrink he used has already worn out lol, Denis stuff 2x the thickness
[2022-06-12T15:13:42] Mirono escooters: F
[2022-06-12T15:13:47] Happy Giraffe: <animation>
[2022-06-12T15:14:02] Mirono escooters: Having another layer under shrink helps too
[2022-06-12T15:14:39] Happy Giraffe: Now mine has Albert stuff and two Denis shrink on top that stack in the middle for a bit😅
[2022-06-12T15:14:48] Mirono escooters: Good enough
[2022-06-12T15:15:06] Happy Giraffe: Will be enough, but the stock shit was way too thin. Like a condom lol
[2022-06-12T15:15:15] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2022-06-12T15:15:24] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-06-12T15:15:35] Mirono escooters: I always buy from same seller wich i know has thic enough wrap
[2022-06-12T15:15:55] Mirono escooters: Bought once diff wrap,.it teared so easily. Even when shrinking. Heat up abit too much too long teared.
[2022-06-12T15:16:26] Happy Giraffe: I had to do long aswell, only hair dryer
[2022-06-12T15:16:39] Mirono escooters: Ahh hair dryer haha, not that hot
[2022-06-12T15:16:50] Mirono escooters: Heatgun gang ☻️
[2022-06-12T15:17:18] Happy Giraffe: But got a nice result, shrink meant for bigger 7p and not 6p
[2022-06-12T15:17:29] Mirono escooters: As long as it fits
[2022-06-12T15:17:44] Mirono escooters: I got every size up with 10mm. So i always got perfext fit
[2022-06-12T15:17:55] Happy Giraffe: Yep, sits nice and tight. For the ends I dont care if not fully sealed
[2022-06-12T15:18:14] Mirono escooters: U did good, especially for price u sell it haha
[2022-06-12T15:18:20] Happy Giraffe: I keep it🌚
[2022-06-12T15:18:29] Mirono escooters: Ooh
[2022-06-12T15:18:38] Mirono escooters: Thougt u were selling ur internal
[2022-06-12T15:19:05] Happy Giraffe: Was first plan but now keeping, 13s6p 35E enough for a geared motor
[2022-06-12T15:19:16] Mirono escooters: Ö
[2022-06-12T15:19:26] Mirono escooters: And backpack batt?
[2022-06-12T15:20:31] Happy Giraffe: Nope, based on some motor simulations I should get 15wh/km consumption so enough range from this alone
[2022-06-12T15:21:48] Mirono escooters: Noice
[2022-06-12T15:22:06] Mirono escooters: I want power not efficienty ☻️
[2022-06-12T15:37:07] Happy Giraffe: I will have both🌚
[2022-06-12T15:37:49] rosheee: 45degrees winding
[2022-06-12T15:37:54] Happy Giraffe: 90Nm no joke if it consumes that little power, will never overheat and is just raw continuous torque😂
[2022-06-12T15:38:09] Happy Giraffe: Nice!
[2022-06-12T15:38:21] rosheee: Lol 1nm per kilo

[2022-06-12T17:54:24] Mirono escooters: 1 to add to the collection
[2022-06-12T18:27:49] Artem Bulashev: Battery should not move - heat shrink only wears out if battery moves. Why da hell is to moving 😂
[2022-06-12T18:29:44] Happy Giraffe: Not moving
[2022-06-12T18:29:55] Happy Giraffe: Shrink is thin so normal wear
[2022-06-12T18:30:09] Paolo ⁭: But this is by crash lol
[2022-06-12T18:31:01] sombre_enfant: Straighten it bqck no problem
[2022-06-12T18:36:53] Mirono escooters: Ez ive been hitting the gim
[2022-06-12T18:59:05] Happy Giraffe: But metal gets weaker everytime you bend it🌚
[2022-06-12T19:00:15] sombre_enfant: You can only do it once
[2022-06-12T19:03:11] Mirono escooters: Get blowtorch ☻️
[2022-06-12T19:04:14] Happy Giraffe: Throw the trash scooter in junkyard and get some new
[2022-06-12T19:04:25] Happy Giraffe: Maybe keep forks😂
[2022-06-12T19:05:00] Artem Bulashev: 40t stock 😄
[2022-06-12T19:09:06] Mirono escooters: 60/200a ;)
[2022-06-12T19:11:49] sombre_enfant: If bms can do 200A for 2min can i set 150A phase per controller ?
[2022-06-12T19:12:07] Mirono escooters: Phase doesnt matter for bms draw
[2022-06-12T19:12:11] Mirono escooters: Batt current does
[2022-06-12T19:12:24] sombre_enfant: For real
[2022-06-12T19:12:43] Mirono escooters: Yea. U can have 150a phase w 10a batt :) (Not saying you should, but you *can*)
[2022-06-12T19:13:46] Mirono escooters: Phase currents can be much higher at low speeds for good torque Batt amps if u set 50 will be 50, nothing to do w phase
[2022-06-12T19:13:47] Happy Giraffe: Phase from ESC to motor Batt from batt to esc
[2022-06-12T19:13:51] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-06-12T19:13:56] Mirono escooters: Easier explanation
[2022-06-12T19:14:39] Happy Giraffe: Lets say you go 50% max speed your esc can convert the unused voltage into motor current
[2022-06-12T19:14:58] Happy Giraffe: Not scientifically accurate but close enough for easy explanation
[2022-06-12T19:15:11] Mirono escooters: Yes my brain farted
[2022-06-12T19:15:53] Happy Giraffe: Mostly phase current is high during the first 25% of the max speed
[2022-06-12T19:16:08] Happy Giraffe: Then gets smaller and smaller
[2022-06-12T19:16:38] Mirono escooters: For supa torque
[2022-06-12T20:33:43] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_4855@12-06-2022_20-33-43.jpg>
[2022-06-12T20:33:55] Mirono escooters: Even with 203mm adaptor it sits too high.. 😮‍💨
[2022-06-12T20:34:28] Paolo ⁭: Washer
[2022-06-12T20:35:24] Mirono escooters: 180mm adaptor with washer it is
[2022-06-12T20:41:06] Paolo ⁭: So 203mm + washer
[2022-06-12T20:43:46] Happy Giraffe: Its because of the motor axle
[2022-06-12T20:44:02] Happy Giraffe: Its not fully seated in dropout
[2022-06-12T20:44:51] Happy Giraffe: Also do something for this lol
[2022-06-12T20:49:48] Mirono escooters: Itis fully seated
[2022-06-12T20:49:59] Mirono escooters: That are 2 torque arms and a washer
[2022-06-12T20:50:22] Happy Giraffe: X doubt
[2022-06-12T20:50:29] Mirono escooters: Im 100% sure
[2022-06-12T20:51:08] Happy Giraffe: I think its the above
[2022-06-12T21:26:54] Mirono escooters: Or it moved when torqueing
[2022-06-12T21:39:15] rosheee: Reversed?
[2022-06-12T22:33:30] rosheee: 2024

[2022-06-12T22:57:36] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-06-12T22:59:19] Mirono escooters: I checked again, dropouts where in
[2022-06-12T23:00:33] Mirono escooters: Then i assembled everything, went for a ride all good. Then i had the stupid idea to tilt bike 30* and give throttle, it would be cool Toink Left Dropout (side i tilted to) went out Axle didnt spin or so Just fell out 1 side I must do something wrong, or am i not allowed to do that ☻️
[2022-06-12T23:00:45] Mirono escooters: Tightened nuts very hard
[2022-06-12T23:14:09] Happy Giraffe: Need to be 100% in, not 99%
[2022-06-12T23:14:11] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-06-12T23:14:40] Happy Giraffe: No torque arm and too many washers for Leaning tower of Piza
[2022-06-12T23:14:50] Mirono escooters: 2 torque arms at that side lol
[2022-06-12T23:15:02] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_4860@12-06-2022_23-15-02.jpg>
[2022-06-12T23:15:21] Happy Giraffe: And still fell off?
[2022-06-12T23:15:45] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-06-12T23:15:51] Mirono escooters: But not from heavyw load
[2022-06-12T23:16:07] Mirono escooters: Just stupid me tilting bcs i thought spinning tire would b cool
[2022-06-12T23:16:19] Happy Giraffe: Torque arm not properly installed
[2022-06-12T23:16:31] Mirono escooters: No other way
[2022-06-12T23:16:36] Happy Giraffe: Needs to lay flat on frame bar
[2022-06-12T23:16:57] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_4861@12-06-2022_23-16-57.jpg>
[2022-06-12T23:17:02] Mirono escooters: Thats impossible
[2022-06-12T23:17:15] Happy Giraffe: Surely not🌚
[2022-06-12T23:17:17] Mirono escooters: It rests agains it already
[2022-06-12T23:17:57] Happy Giraffe: But is some weird torque arm I think, Grin V4 works bit different
[2022-06-12T23:18:23] Mirono escooters: Tried 2 so far, frame design is hard to get one to fit
[2022-06-12T23:18:28] Happy Giraffe: Hard to say exactly whats wrong as I cant take a look personally
[2022-06-12T23:18:45] Mirono escooters: My friend will, he knows better,haha
[2022-06-12T23:18:48] Happy Giraffe: You can go to local metal shop and they make for you
[2022-06-12T23:18:56] Mirono escooters: Prob best idea..
[2022-06-12T23:19:32] Happy Giraffe: Made from one piece and then a piece at the end you can adjust the height by flipping it around or make a new piece
[2022-06-12T23:20:55] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_4862@12-06-2022_23-20-55.jpg>

[2022-06-13T10:38:54] Mirono escooters: The mt4 brake pads appear very loose. Its weird.
[2022-06-13T10:39:04] Mirono escooters: I kno its w magnets but. Idk
[2022-06-13T11:48:16] Mirono escooters: The ferrofluid defenitely helps. After 5 min ride motor cover warm. Before never

[2022-06-13T15:33:43] Unknown: ASI BAC controllers are super powerful from what I know of them. I have heard they can be really tricky to setup and make setting adjustments. Not sure if the user is able to just go in and change settings. I feel like they come programmed for specific motors, which is strange. Like, great controllers but not user friendly from my understanding. Going from open source VESC software to ASI "locked" software might suck big time for you since you like to make settings changes. I'm curious how their software works. Do you know much about it and how/if you can make setting changes?
[2022-06-13T15:37:44] Unknown: Oh.. maybe I'm wrong 🤷🏻‍♂️. According to this guy the level of tuning is super in depth, lots of settings to adjust. Hmm.
[2022-06-13T15:38:21] Unknown: But @roscheeee you would need 2X bac4000s? One per motor.. right? Wouldn't that be like $3000 for 2 controllers?
[2022-06-13T15:40:10] Unknown: And then guy says "they're locked for tuning" So I dunno
[2022-06-13T15:40:18] Mirono escooters: He will still mod the controller
[2022-06-13T15:41:26] Unknown: I have no doubts about that 😂

[2022-06-13T16:45:43] Mirono escooters: Now im interested in specs?
[2022-06-13T16:46:27] rosheee: 20S10P
[2022-06-13T16:46:29] rosheee: Idk
[2022-06-13T16:46:35] rosheee: It is massiv and best looking
[2022-06-13T16:46:41] rosheee: And has best parts
[2022-06-13T16:46:44] rosheee: Well done
[2022-06-13T16:46:54] rosheee: And range
[2022-06-13T16:49:09] Unknown: 20s9p Samsung 48X 43.2ah Mooch has tested the 48X cells so the datasheet is available. At 155a battery thats 17.2a per cell. That's most definitely the upper range for these cells. I only run those amps for big dick test logging lol. Usually around 130a battery normally
[2022-06-13T16:49:50] Unknown: I built the battery for 150a (ish) max output, which is spot on for my motor max
[2022-06-13T16:50:01] Unknown: I wasn't going for a 300a battery lol
[2022-06-13T16:50:41] Mirono escooters: 17.2, nice
[2022-06-13T16:50:43] Unknown: Riding moderately I can easily get 50 miles of range, riding easy going I could really push 80+ miles if I needed to. Riding hard and fast 40 miles no problem.
[2022-06-13T16:51:04] Mirono escooters: Thats sick
[2022-06-13T16:51:12] Mirono escooters: Dream batt specs, must cost shitload
[2022-06-13T16:51:48] Unknown: $5.75 per cell shipped to my doorstep from Canada. Not cheap but nothing out of control
[2022-06-13T16:52:11] Mirono escooters: Awtsh
[2022-06-13T16:52:16] Unknown: Definitely not $2 garbage cells
[2022-06-13T16:52:23] Mirono escooters: If only i had the space haha

[2022-06-13T16:52:54] Happy Giraffe: Oh, still not too bad
[2022-06-13T16:53:33] Unknown: Yea.. just a matter of choosing the proper cells for max amp draw while keeping capacity as high as possible
[2022-06-13T16:53:57] Mirono escooters: Indeed
[2022-06-13T16:54:08] Unknown: That's what Artem helped me figure out. The best cell choice for max amps (safely not damaging them) and also highest capacity
[2022-06-13T16:54:35] Mirono escooters: We love artem
[2022-06-13T16:54:50] Unknown: I do too. He got the cells for me
[2022-06-13T16:54:52] rosheee: 4.20 for molicel
[2022-06-13T16:54:57] rosheee: Even 4.11
[2022-06-13T16:54:59] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-06-13T16:55:32] Unknown: Molicel was shit for my setup and amps. Low capacity and less wh. If I needed more amps, then yes. Would have not made sense at all for me

[2022-06-13T17:45:15] francois schempers: what do you guys think I can acheive rangewise with 20kwh 20s battery and 8kw motor ? whole bike will weigh alone 150kilo
[2022-06-13T17:45:23] rosheee: Still have 1 pair of mt8 to sell
[2022-06-13T17:45:53] Mirono escooters: 69km
[2022-06-13T17:46:04] Mirono escooters: Wich speed is important
[2022-06-13T17:46:07] francois schempers: lol x)
[2022-06-13T17:46:49] francois schempers: average 100kmh, peak at 130
[2022-06-13T17:47:13] Mirono escooters: Ok so motor highway, constant little breaking accel
[2022-06-13T17:47:40] francois schempers: yeah
[2022-06-13T17:49:25] Mirono escooters: Ill go with 350km
[2022-06-13T17:54:41] rosheee: Guys go ferro chat and say
[2022-06-13T17:54:46] rosheee: Or i take them
[2022-06-13T17:54:52] rosheee: Which?

[2022-06-13T18:02:49] Happy Giraffe: You really want to improve aerodynamics of the bike
[2022-06-13T18:25:08] Mirono escooters: Nah push amps
[2022-06-13T18:39:14] Happy Giraffe: 15kwh vs 20kwh the 15 will go further if more aerodynamic🌚
[2022-06-13T18:39:34] Happy Giraffe: Equal importance or even more actually than batt size
[2022-06-13T18:39:42] Mirono escooters: Boring
[2022-06-13T18:39:50] Mirono escooters: 20kwh is cooler
[2022-06-13T18:40:02] Happy Giraffe: Lol
[2022-06-13T18:40:10] Mirono escooters: Sitting on escoot is more efficient I dont see anyone here doing it :)
[2022-06-13T18:40:23] Happy Giraffe: Illegal
[2022-06-13T18:40:37] Mirono escooters: Yea like 120kmh is legal💀😂
[2022-06-13T18:40:44] Happy Giraffe: Oh now I remember I gotta throw one seat to trash
[2022-06-13T18:40:51] Mirono escooters: Whut
[2022-06-13T18:41:00] Happy Giraffe: One ordered long time ago
[2022-06-13T18:41:05] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-06-13T18:41:19] Mirono escooters: Donate to me
[2022-06-13T18:41:22] Mirono escooters: 😀
[2022-06-13T19:09:41] Happy Giraffe: Too late and box is full
[2022-06-13T19:12:21] Mirono escooters: :(

[2022-06-13T19:16:26] Luis Magalhaes: Nami motor?
[2022-06-13T19:18:02] rosheee: Kaabo
[2022-06-13T19:18:17] D J: Good job. I did the same on mine 😁
[2022-06-13T19:18:26] rosheee: Yah but this is added again
[2022-06-13T19:18:31] rosheee: After adde
[2022-06-13T19:18:36] rosheee: Now 10-11ml
[2022-06-13T19:18:40] rosheee: I order new bottle
[2022-06-13T19:18:43] rosheee: XD
[2022-06-13T19:18:46] D J: I bit less than you 😅

[2022-06-13T19:22:55] D J: I'm poor I can't add much 🤣
[2022-06-13T19:25:05] Happy Giraffe: You gotta also seal motor with silicone etc to make it stay there
[2022-06-13T19:26:29] D J: Yap
[2022-06-13T19:28:16] Luis Magalhaes: It looks like a nami logo there 😂😂👍
[2022-06-13T19:28:37] rosheee: XD mooore

[2022-06-13T19:28:50] rosheee: Yas
[2022-06-13T19:29:01] rosheee: Gonna order just nami frame
[2022-06-13T19:29:32] D J: I love NAMI frame too
[2022-06-13T19:29:50] Luis Magalhaes: Do they sell to you?
[2022-06-13T19:29:50] D J: Good construction
[2022-06-13T19:30:16] D J: To you too 😃
[2022-06-13T19:30:47] rosheee: To a friend
[2022-06-13T19:31:14] rosheee: But this is perfect
[2022-06-13T19:31:24] rosheee: Steering has perfect angle
[2022-06-13T19:38:27] Luis Magalhaes: Thats the slack
[2022-06-13T19:38:32] Luis Magalhaes: ?
[2022-06-13T19:43:41] rosheee: Oh yas
[2022-06-13T19:46:30] rosheee: If u wanna get shiny and easy 2 clean scooter
[2022-06-13T19:47:10] rosheee: <photos/photo_4888@13-06-2022_19-47-10.jpg>
[2022-06-13T19:47:11] rosheee: See difference?
[2022-06-13T19:56:35] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-06-13T19:56:36] rosheee: True grease
[2022-06-13T19:56:57] rosheee: For shock and where moving metal n stuff is
[2022-06-13T19:57:27] rosheee: <photos/photo_4889@13-06-2022_19-57-27.jpg>
[2022-06-13T19:59:04] Happy Giraffe: Lithium grease ftw
[2022-06-13T19:59:07] Happy Giraffe: Fight me
[2022-06-13T19:59:10] Happy Giraffe: <animation>
[2022-06-13T19:59:18] rosheee: Best
[2022-06-14T00:19:12] Artem Bulashev: What is that scoot?
[2022-06-14T00:20:10] Кирилл: slack core
[2022-06-14T00:20:34] Artem Bulashev: That is one of very few that I can not name a weak spot in frame integrity design
[2022-06-14T00:20:44] Artem Bulashev: Actually found one potential issue
[2022-06-14T00:21:17] Artem Bulashev: Never mind found one more and it is 100% issue
[2022-06-14T00:21:30] Artem Bulashev: Who designed it?
[2022-06-14T00:22:51] Artem Bulashev: This will fail in a few of harder riding condition under 100kg rider if it is as it seems on that model
[2022-06-14T00:23:59] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_4890@14-06-2022_00-23-59.jpg>
[2022-06-14T00:26:28] Artem Bulashev: 1. No comments, that was clearly miss calculated. 2. Considering the vector of force from each bump that place will need to be very thick not to break off eventually on or of the potholes 3. Those seem to be overly optimistic, take a look at vsett 10 thickness of foot rest, and structural geometry, this seems a lot skinnier, but would need to see 3d to be sure
[2022-06-14T00:27:17] Mirko Boni: hi everyone, i need help! can i mount the 10 inch blade motor in the front monorim?
[2022-06-14T00:31:20] Кирилл: <photos/photo_4891@14-06-2022_00-31-20.jpg>
[2022-06-14T00:35:50] rosheee: yes
[2022-06-14T00:39:02] Happy Giraffe: Need to reverse monorim front suspension sides and then add longer axles on it + washers
[2022-06-14T00:39:13] rosheee: or bend it 16mm each
[2022-06-14T00:39:17] rosheee: washercrew
[2022-06-14T00:39:37] Happy Giraffe: Then you gotta do it properly and thats hard
[2022-06-14T00:39:46] Mirko Boni: Ohhh thank you!!
[2022-06-14T00:39:56] rosheee: go hard or go home
[2022-06-14T00:40:01] rosheee: 😅😅😅
[2022-06-14T00:40:04] rosheee: omfg
[2022-06-14T00:40:05] rosheee: which bearings
[2022-06-14T00:40:10] rosheee: RS rsr 2z
[2022-06-14T00:40:16] rosheee: 🙈😤
[2022-06-14T00:40:28] Mirko Boni: Thank you!
[2022-06-14T00:40:49] Happy Giraffe: If you use only one blade motor be sure you can push 40A battery and 120A phase current minimum
[2022-06-14T00:41:00] Happy Giraffe: Better to have awd
[2022-06-14T00:41:27] Mirko Boni: I will mount two engines
[2022-06-14T00:41:54] Mirko Boni: 16S 5P samsung 50e
[2022-06-14T00:42:22] Mirko Boni: Do you think it is okay?
[2022-06-14T00:46:45] rosheee: ohh fuckeria
[2022-06-14T00:46:55] rosheee: i have 16s5p 50g
[2022-06-14T00:47:07] rosheee: u can push 180A peak short time
[2022-06-14T00:47:31] rosheee: 130A max battery current for 2 motors
[2022-06-14T00:47:38] rosheee: but going h0t
[2022-06-14T00:48:01] rosheee: <photos/photo_4892@14-06-2022_00-48-01.jpg>
[2022-06-14T00:48:09] Mirko Boni: Wait, I have to make a new battery! They offered me the Samsung 50e cells! I have not purchased yet!
[2022-06-14T00:48:14] rosheee: 2x50A safe
[2022-06-14T00:48:24] rosheee: g30?
[2022-06-14T00:48:27] rosheee: make 6P
[2022-06-14T00:48:29] Mirko Boni: Yes
[2022-06-14T00:48:41] Mirko Boni: 16S 5P
[2022-06-14T00:48:50] rosheee: why not 6p?
[2022-06-14T00:49:12] rosheee: if 5P go daly 60 or 80a bms
[2022-06-14T00:49:15] rosheee: 60A has 180 peak
[2022-06-14T00:49:30] Mirko Boni: There is not the right space for the esc
[2022-06-14T00:49:56] rosheee: o.Owhy?
[2022-06-14T00:50:05] Mirko Boni: I want to mount the esc inside the platform
[2022-06-14T00:50:40] Mirko Boni: I don't understand what you wrote!
[2022-06-14T00:50:49] rosheee: why doesn't fit?
[2022-06-14T00:51:21] rosheee: this 5P
[2022-06-14T00:51:22] rosheee: <photos/photo_4893@14-06-2022_00-51-22.jpg>
[2022-06-14T00:51:26] rosheee: 6P fit as well
[2022-06-14T00:51:31] Mirko Boni: The 16s 5p battery is 37cm long
[2022-06-14T00:51:46] rosheee: it is just wider
[2022-06-14T00:51:48] Mirko Boni: 6p?
[2022-06-14T00:51:51] rosheee: 5P
[2022-06-14T00:51:59] rosheee: but same length with 6P
[2022-06-14T00:52:39] Mirko Boni: Ok! So 6p same length but more width?
[2022-06-14T00:53:15] rosheee: <photos/photo_4894@14-06-2022_00-53-15.jpg>
[2022-06-14T00:53:24] rosheee: yes
[2022-06-14T00:53:27] rosheee: but it fits
[2022-06-14T00:54:10] Mirko Boni: Ok perfect
[2022-06-14T00:55:08] Mirko Boni: The seller offered me a 16S 5p with Sony vtc6a 20Ah
[2022-06-14T00:55:34] rosheee: 50e
[2022-06-14T00:56:09] Mirko Boni: But are the 50e good for the blade motor?
[2022-06-14T00:57:31] Unknown: 2rs is perfect. 2rsh is heavy seals and high rolling resistance. Zz is steel and not sealed at all, but lowest rolling resistance. 2rs is a happy medium
[2022-06-14T01:02:32] Mirko Boni: I thought about buying the two original blade escs which can deliver 35A
[2022-06-14T01:02:40] rosheee: Zz?
[2022-06-14T01:02:42] rosheee: 2z?
[2022-06-14T01:07:26] Artem Bulashev: Forge aluminum… well sounds good and if it is so it should thab be strong enough in all points beside point 1. But I would reduce chance of failing there down to 50% instead of 100%. Geometry can be smart enough to compensate such structural location - location of it weakens construction SIGNIFICANTLY as whole is too close to lower edge, and there are 2 opposing forces at all times and bump introduces 3 vectorial force onto that joint. It has high but not absolute chance of collapsing at that spot if it is forged high quality aluminum.
[2022-06-14T01:08:09] Artem Bulashev: Everything else looks great, titanium is great to combat flex indeed
[2022-06-14T01:08:32] Кирилл: I agree with you about this edge point, but will see so in time how it will work
[2022-06-14T01:08:33] Artem Bulashev: May be too much for handle bar, could save cost there
[2022-06-14T01:09:20] Artem Bulashev: Aluminum handle bar doesn’t give much flex, it all comes from neck / stem / or neck to deck mounting
[2022-06-14T01:10:37] Artem Bulashev: This neck design looks better than what I have seen in a long time (very well done from applied forces perspective, smart person evolved)
[2022-06-14T01:10:48] Artem Bulashev: This is actually why I started vsett group
[2022-06-14T01:15:03] Artem Bulashev: When I saw vsett line up, all beside 8/8+ I saw good engendering and understanding, didn’t know if it was by chance or by knowledge, but I saw them doing more than any one else back in Dec 2020 before they started selling. (Fully custom parts = they can easily change design to adjust if weak point surfaced. And it did and they did fix it faster than I even expected) - vsett 9 had neck design that I told them will break in March 2021, in July they fixed it, in September we saw first case of original design break, but no one broke after they removed weak spot. Second point was their dealership system and good price range ✅ This is now the second design I see on the market that I feel like I would trust, brings of old feeling of discovering vsett ❤️
[2022-06-14T01:18:05] Artem Bulashev: Yeah because it is supposed to be 75a MAX from 5p 50g 😂😂 that’s why it is hot. You need p42a if you want to use 25a battery current from each sell
[2022-06-14T01:18:34] Artem Bulashev: Not even 50s will handle 25a well enough, will get hot, just not as hot.
[2022-06-14T01:20:20] Artem Bulashev: Ну наконец-то. Осталась только в корпус затолкать. Цена вопроса — 10$ + печать корпуса.
[2022-06-14T01:20:41] Artem Bulashev: Some one made a tiny basic scenes code for ttgo
[2022-06-14T01:21:12] Artem Bulashev: Not too shabby for 10$
[2022-06-14T01:35:18] Happy Giraffe: Take 5p 48x instead
[2022-06-14T01:36:01] Mirko Boni: What does 48X mean?
[2022-06-14T01:36:10] Happy Giraffe: Samsung 48x 21700 cell
[2022-06-14T01:36:51] Mirko Boni: https://www.batemo.de/products/batemo-cell-library/inr21700-48x/
[2022-06-14T04:00:33] Artem Bulashev: Nooo 🫠
[2022-06-14T04:00:48] Artem Bulashev: For 130-150a?
[2022-06-14T04:01:23] Artem Bulashev: How many battery amps you want yo have set in both vesc together ?
[2022-06-14T04:02:10] Artem Bulashev: 48x is only slightly better than 50g in amps delivery, like 2-3amps better before it gets to same temp
[2022-06-14T04:02:45] Artem Bulashev: M50LT gen2 is better than both of those in all their range (0-15amps)
[2022-06-14T05:42:42] Happy Giraffe: Now he thought 50E 5p for awd (25A for motor), 48x would be 35A per motor.
[2022-06-14T05:44:07] Happy Giraffe: 25 too low for blade imo even with awd, 35 starts to be ok. But yeah could be more but then capacity stuffers and cell becomes more expensive😅
[2022-06-14T06:58:08] rosheee: Doing one as well f
[2022-06-14T07:39:34] sombre_enfant: 6p 50e with copper will be ok for dual 50A
[2022-06-14T07:44:20] sombre_enfant: Maybe i'll do 4p external
[2022-06-14T07:45:02] Mirono escooters: Theoretically 50e can peak 15a :)
[2022-06-14T08:00:54] rosheee: Yeh or 180A in 5P with dr0000p
[2022-06-14T08:01:07] Mirono escooters: Yes that's u
[2022-06-14T08:01:12] Mirono escooters: U special
[2022-06-14T08:18:50] rosheee: U can do it as well
[2022-06-14T08:18:54] rosheee: Tudor special
[2022-06-14T08:18:56] rosheee: He made it
[2022-06-14T08:23:50] Mirono escooters: Exxept melted xase xd
[2022-06-14T08:43:13] Happy Giraffe: Just use proper cells
[2022-06-14T09:25:23] francois schempers: how much are you going to pay for that ?
[2022-06-14T09:36:26] Happy Giraffe: Rather get dual Ubox
[2022-06-14T09:46:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Stupid question basically, no reason to open something when you are lazy
[2022-06-14T09:48:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You clearly see dirt there , no reason to close something full of dirt/ dust whatever
[2022-06-14T09:49:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dont you want laotie ones?
[2022-06-14T09:55:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Single z zz 2 z all not for us as Adam said ,not sealed Rs 2rs is sealing Basically same Bearings just you have the plastic protection on top, not sure what he means happy medium, With skf you can have rsh what has more protection, but i personaly tested and same shit like medium price Bearings , Since we roll on ball bearings
[2022-06-14T09:55:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: For the last part i would beat up all who ever desingned any scooter , pretty much shows that they got no experience even didn't got a bike when they were kids

[2022-06-14T09:59:03] Mirko Boni: What is double ubox?
[2022-06-14T09:59:35] francois schempers: yup,for that price take ubox
[2022-06-14T09:59:45] francois schempers: the group pic ^^
[2022-06-14T10:00:15] francois schempers: it's from spintend
[2022-06-14T10:00:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Go to spintend.com
[2022-06-14T10:00:28] Happy Giraffe: The vesc that created this group afterall😂😅

[2022-06-14T10:00:58] Happy Giraffe: All that blade crap is so expensive
[2022-06-14T10:01:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Coz its written blade on it🤷‍♂
[2022-06-14T10:01:42] Happy Giraffe: Ali reseller having good margins
[2022-06-14T10:02:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Same goes to all scoots like that
[2022-06-14T10:05:30] Mirko Boni: Guys, I know this vesc, I have studied and it is very good, unfortunately I have measured, it does not fit in the compartment together with the battery!
[2022-06-14T10:06:24] Mirko Boni: <animation>
[2022-06-14T10:06:28] Mirko Boni: 😂😂😂😂
[2022-06-14T10:06:29] francois schempers: take a 1cm spacer and mount battery verticaly
[2022-06-14T10:07:37] Mirko Boni: The seller told me that the 16S 5p battery is 37 cm long so there are only 10 cm left for the vesc

[2022-06-14T10:09:18] francois schempers: ask him to make the cell vertical, with a space that works
[2022-06-14T10:09:50] francois schempers: wireless shunt
[2022-06-14T10:10:08] Konstantin: Wire connection... On board WiFi+Bluetooth....

[2022-06-14T10:12:29] Mirko Boni: Sorry, but how long are your 16S 5p batteries?
[2022-06-14T10:12:33] francois schempers: 👌
[2022-06-14T10:14:43] francois schempers: ask battery makers in this group to make one for you with a spacer, that would be better
[2022-06-14T10:16:03] Mirko Boni: Yes, I asked in Italy! It is 37 cm long! No vendor can make a battery less than 37cm long
[2022-06-14T10:16:47] francois schempers: with a spacer they can

[2022-06-14T10:20:27] francois schempers: tell them to make the cells vertical
[2022-06-14T10:20:56] Mirko Boni: He told me he put the cells upright!
[2022-06-14T10:36:38] Happy Giraffe: Get better cells than 50E
[2022-06-14T10:37:39] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-06-14T10:38:10] Happy Giraffe: Could the three buttons be programmed to do something else?
[2022-06-14T10:40:18] Mirko Boni: Yess! I want to install Sony vtc6a cells
[2022-06-14T10:41:20] Happy Giraffe: Maybe Molicel cheaper
[2022-06-14T10:55:57] Mirko Boni: Samsung 40t
[2022-06-14T11:01:33] rosheee: Vat?
[2022-06-14T11:01:42] rosheee: XD fack EU
[2022-06-14T11:02:02] rosheee: @Her0DasH the vsett bearings run hot xD
[2022-06-14T11:02:21] rosheee: Had same issue with g30 bearings when go 60kmh over 20min
[2022-06-14T11:43:53] sombre_enfant: Hell nah
[2022-06-14T11:52:17] Happy Giraffe: Depends on your supplier prices etc. If I remember right people preferred molicel over samsung
[2022-06-14T11:55:30] Mirko Boni: Ahh! Ok ok! Thank you!
[2022-06-14T11:57:38] sombre_enfant: Molicell out of stock...
[2022-06-14T12:06:20] Happy Giraffe: Everything was kinda, LG only one left but even those hard to find😂
[2022-06-14T12:06:48] Konstantin: I love my 50g gnusmasas ;))
[2022-06-14T12:23:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Guess why
[2022-06-14T12:24:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Did you change em?
[2022-06-14T12:25:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Coz shitty ones die from all ,better ones dont die to high speed ,coz we use em on lower speeds compared to machines ,but soon as balls get damaged and roll like an egg maked you extra heat
[2022-06-14T12:28:56] Mirko Boni: 😔😔😔
[2022-06-14T12:40:39] rosheee: They run sincr 17k km xyd
[2022-06-14T12:40:45] Happy Giraffe: And melt with a nice fall on your face
[2022-06-14T12:40:47] rosheee: So i take the rz?
[2022-06-14T12:40:56] rosheee: Not yet
[2022-06-14T12:41:15] Happy Giraffe: 2rs best, sealed
[2022-06-14T14:35:01] Mirono escooters: Problably simple question but im a simple man
[2022-06-14T14:35:30] Mirono escooters: When i wanna kno how much w i push, i look at batt amps or phase? For peak and continuous
[2022-06-14T14:45:50] francois schempers: you'll have more or less the same, because phase Amps are higher when the mosfet Vdrop
[2022-06-14T14:46:15] Mirono escooters: But if i say i push x w peak in it
[2022-06-14T14:46:21] Mirono escooters: Oh yes no wait. Im stupid
[2022-06-14T14:46:40] Mirono escooters: Theres no free energy Right So phase amps and their v are same w as batt amps and voltage
[2022-06-14T14:46:46] Mirono escooters: Right i forgot that
[2022-06-14T14:46:50] francois schempers: you'll just also draw more on the battery on peak consumption
[2022-06-14T14:47:56] Mirono escooters: Ok got that😀
[2022-06-14T14:48:06] Mirono escooters: Poor motor, 2600w continu on 1500w rated
[2022-06-14T14:48:11] francois schempers: technically phase W are a bit less even, because of the loss in controller
[2022-06-14T14:48:34] Mirono escooters: True
[2022-06-14T14:48:39] Mirono escooters: Ok i look at bat amps then
[2022-06-14T14:48:44] francois schempers: motor can usually handle x3 their rating
[2022-06-14T14:49:05] Mirono escooters: And Ferrofluid , it helps alot
[2022-06-14T14:49:16] Mirono escooters: Im still surprised how fast heat dissappates now
[2022-06-14T14:49:43] francois schempers: yeah that make a difference !
[2022-06-14T14:50:11] Mirono escooters: Temp sensor internal, lets see. Poor motor
[2022-06-14T14:50:33] Mirono escooters: Next is modding cooling fins, but with centrifugal force. Thats harder
[2022-06-14T14:50:56] Mirono escooters: (And this is with *cheap *,.imagine real deal)
[2022-06-14T14:58:23] Unknown: Cooling fins or heatsink on the motors is definitely on my to do list as well. Haven't really seen any good options. Wish I had a 3d printer to make a few types of motor coolers like Pirate. The hubsinks from grin for ebikes I don't think will even if I bend them
[2022-06-14T14:58:48] Mirono escooters: Still, 3d print just direct air flow
[2022-06-14T14:59:14] Mirono escooters: No way i pay 130€ for 200g of curved metal tho
[2022-06-14T15:00:09] Mirono escooters: But bending myself,.do i trust that And with 65kmh centrifugal force. No. No just attach regular ones If that flies off and hits or me or a spoke.
[2022-06-14T15:00:22] Unknown: LoL... Yea they're not cheap for sure. I wish there was a way for figure it out. I'm super handy but this has me scratching my head
[2022-06-14T15:00:49] Mirono escooters: U could bend it too much so it clamps itself, but still u need a tight fit or its just fancy metal
[2022-06-14T15:00:59] Unknown: Yea there's that too. Nice thing about the motor cooler and hubsinks... They use bolts and/or thermal paste
[2022-06-14T15:01:00] Mirono escooters: Or buy a good motor but so boring. 😀
[2022-06-14T15:01:07] Mirono escooters: True
[2022-06-14T15:01:17] Mirono escooters: Could prob mod the clamps urself tho
[2022-06-14T15:01:47] Mirono escooters: I think ill order some long heatsinks and mess around. Worst that can happen
[2022-06-14T15:02:11] Unknown: Haha... I've been eyeing the falconpev high speed 10" dual phase motors... They come 60v 1600w or 60v 3200w. Not really sure of the difference, maybe kv? Not sure which ones to use on 72v.
[2022-06-14T15:02:19] Mirono escooters: I find it weird alieexpress doesnt have it, problably not a big market
[2022-06-14T15:02:31] Unknown: Yea same here. Would think there would be something
[2022-06-14T15:02:32] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2022-06-14T15:02:36] Mirono escooters: Falconpev doodoo
[2022-06-14T15:03:12] Unknown: Thing is. Vsett motors are perfectly fine power wise... And they haven't heated past 80C at the windings yet... But in the summer heat I think they'll push a bit higher
[2022-06-14T15:03:27] Mirono escooters: I should just hit up a teacher at dads work, they have industrial cnc. 😀
[2022-06-14T15:03:37] Unknown: For real? Even the motors? It's the most powerful motor I found for my 135mm dropout
[2022-06-14T15:03:38] Paolo ⁭: High Kv motors heat less but no efficient
[2022-06-14T15:03:39] Mirono escooters: Yea im scared for summer
[2022-06-14T15:04:02] Unknown: Do you think that's the difference between the 1600w and 3200w? Kv?
[2022-06-14T15:04:11] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2022-06-14T15:04:18] Mirono escooters: Falconpev i can't vote for. Sended wrong motor, and a sabvoton without working throttle input So yea. Thats that Also no help service and past paypal refund time
[2022-06-14T15:04:27] Paolo ⁭: But mean also as half of torque with same current
[2022-06-14T15:04:37] Unknown: https://www.falconpev.com.sg/products/10-inch-high-speed-motor?_pos=16&_sid=94e551e60&_ss=r
[2022-06-14T15:04:40] Paolo ⁭: Maybe one is 17x4 winding and another one 33x2
[2022-06-14T15:04:41] Mirono escooters: How heat less if its less efficient? Wouldnt that mean more power into heat
[2022-06-14T15:04:48] Unknown: Hmm...
[2022-06-14T15:05:06] Mirono escooters: @Ghost_911 has best scoot motor ive seen so far, but that was custom af
[2022-06-14T15:05:14] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_2244@05-02-2022_18-24-31.jpg>
[2022-06-14T15:05:30] Unknown: Damn... That's exactly what I'd like to do
[2022-06-14T15:05:48] Unknown: Something along those lines.
[2022-06-14T15:05:54] Gigolo Joe: <sticker>
[2022-06-14T15:05:56] Unknown: Looks like copper
[2022-06-14T15:06:02] Mirono escooters: Itis
[2022-06-14T15:06:02] Unknown: Easy to bend
[2022-06-14T15:06:17] Mirono escooters: Or I think it is
[2022-06-14T15:06:37] Unknown: Damn... I wonder if he made those custom or bought them and just modified them
[2022-06-14T15:06:43] Gigolo Joe: Aluminum Cnc made
[2022-06-14T15:06:46] Mirono escooters: Well he is here to ansEr you
[2022-06-14T15:06:48] Unknown: Oh.. there he is 🤗
[2022-06-14T15:07:00] Unknown: CNC... So completely custom made?
[2022-06-14T15:07:07] Paolo ⁭: Let me explain . Motor work as magnetic field , more turns means more spin. So in a same stator if you do more turns means less space for parallels, if you have much parallel you’ve less space for turns. It’s easy
[2022-06-14T15:07:33] Gigolo Joe: Pretty much yes It was from first batches that were made
[2022-06-14T15:07:54] Unknown: Really nice job bro 👍
[2022-06-14T15:07:59] francois schempers: and there is me, who want a 12Kw motor xD
[2022-06-14T15:08:10] Happy Giraffe: Yes peak powers
[2022-06-14T15:08:21] Mirono escooters: U have more space tho
[2022-06-14T15:08:31] Gigolo Joe: Now it's made by molding process but still does great job at spreading away the heat
[2022-06-14T15:08:38] Mirono escooters: There is a limiting factor for scooters, size. U cant dissappate more whatever u do
[2022-06-14T15:08:51] Gigolo Joe: Thanks I didn't made it tho Made by a friend
[2022-06-14T15:09:06] Unknown: Excellent. Which motor is that on?
[2022-06-14T15:09:21] Gigolo Joe: Inokim ox
[2022-06-14T15:09:31] Unknown: Ahh gotcha 👌
[2022-06-14T15:09:53] Happy Giraffe: You need that for long term high speed riding🌚
[2022-06-14T15:10:01] Unknown: I wonder if diameter is the same or close to Vsett 10 motors 🤔🤔
[2022-06-14T15:10:19] Happy Giraffe: People don't realize how slow motor heats or cools
[2022-06-14T15:10:22] Paolo ⁭: Interesting 10 inch motor
[2022-06-14T15:10:31] Paolo ⁭: Just need know if fit
[2022-06-14T15:10:32] Mirono escooters: Pfft Overcompensating
[2022-06-14T15:10:55] Mirono escooters: Yea after i stopped riding without ferrofluid after 15 mins stopped it was hotter then before 😂

[2022-06-14T15:11:46] Unknown: Oh nice...
[2022-06-14T15:11:52] Happy Giraffe: Yes, that's good fit for it I think
[2022-06-14T15:11:56] Mirono escooters: How much money that is
[2022-06-14T15:11:59] francois schempers: I wonder what they look like inside
[2022-06-14T15:12:03] Happy Giraffe: Any smaller would be issues
[2022-06-14T15:12:07] Mirono escooters: Open it. Pleaaase
[2022-06-14T15:12:09] francois schempers: around 1k€
[2022-06-14T15:12:25] Happy Giraffe: What esc you use?
[2022-06-14T15:12:48] Mirono escooters: Ok fair enough
[2022-06-14T15:13:06] Mirono escooters: Cant u replace fuel motor with a middrive, keep chain
[2022-06-14T15:13:22] Mirono escooters: Id get 10€ alieexpress torque arms tho for 10kw☻️
[2022-06-14T15:13:33] Happy Giraffe: Yes the 138 and the bigger 168 or something
[2022-06-14T15:13:44] Mirono escooters: Less space for batt i guess
[2022-06-14T15:13:47] Paolo ⁭: Pffff

[2022-06-14T15:16:04] Happy Giraffe: Oh damn, can you get encoders?
[2022-06-14T15:16:12] Mirono escooters: Why encoder better
[2022-06-14T15:16:16] Paolo ⁭: Put smaller tire and more cooling😁
[2022-06-14T15:16:18] Happy Giraffe: If halls fail on that you are fucked
[2022-06-14T15:16:34] Happy Giraffe: Doesnt blow
[2022-06-14T15:16:35] Mirono escooters: It problably has backup, even ebike has 2 halls if 1 dies
[2022-06-14T15:16:42] Mirono escooters: How u blow halls?

[2022-06-14T15:17:08] Mirono escooters: You guys just overheated that shit ;)
[2022-06-14T15:17:16] Mirono escooters: Halls max 80* approx
[2022-06-14T15:17:37] Happy Giraffe: I had stock 20A esc
[2022-06-14T15:17:40] Mirono escooters: I never killed halls, except obvious reasons like stripping motor cable and shorting phase v on them☻️☻️
[2022-06-14T15:17:43] Happy Giraffe: So not really
[2022-06-14T15:17:54] Mirono escooters: Thats just ewheels we dont.talk about rm
[2022-06-14T15:18:03] Mirono escooters: I still gotta fix that motor i remember
[2022-06-14T15:18:46] Mirono escooters: After i fixed my motor cable wich was partially damaged my sometimes jonky halls were fixed. I guess they touched on accel 🙈🙈😂
[2022-06-14T15:19:01] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-06-14T15:19:09] Mirono escooters: Once u are used to halls. No returning. I missed it so much, haha
[2022-06-14T15:19:30] Happy Giraffe: I will have Grin chosen halls🌚
[2022-06-14T15:19:36] Mirono escooters: Im gonna 3d make cooler and ask at dads work with puppy eyes
[2022-06-14T15:19:42] Mirono escooters: Cant be bad

[2022-06-14T15:21:44] Mirono escooters: Or yea i saw it in rc car brushless
[2022-06-14T15:21:56] Mirono escooters: Just bcs no physical space halls
[2022-06-14T15:22:04] Happy Giraffe: Have you thought about mid drive?
[2022-06-14T15:22:12] Mirono escooters: Error opening link
[2022-06-14T15:22:22] Mirono escooters: Nvm
[2022-06-14T15:22:25] Mirono escooters: Adblocker
[2022-06-14T15:22:26] Happy Giraffe: But if mid drive then no orig. gearbox😳
[2022-06-14T15:22:57] francois schempers: uh ?
[2022-06-14T15:22:57] Mirono escooters: 1000€ my man swims in money ;)
[2022-06-14T15:23:19] Mirono escooters: Keep chain remove fuel motor and use chain brushless motor
[2022-06-14T15:23:34] francois schempers: it's a long term project ^^ end up cheaper than paying gass nowaday
[2022-06-14T15:24:09] Mirono escooters: True true
[2022-06-14T15:24:34] Mirono escooters: My friend bought emotorxycle for appr9x 3600. Good start, if it eventually dies (batt 8yo) its frame
[2022-06-14T15:24:39] Happy Giraffe: There are insane mid drives from QS nowadays
[2022-06-14T15:25:40] francois schempers: less space for battery if I do that
[2022-06-14T15:26:12] Mirono escooters: Yea guessed that
[2022-06-14T15:26:20] Happy Giraffe: You dont pedal a moto so can have wide batt😁
[2022-06-14T15:26:42] Happy Giraffe: Are you gonna do crashbars for batt?
[2022-06-14T15:26:58] Mirono escooters: Lifepo4 is safe
[2022-06-14T15:27:22] Happy Giraffe: I mean not to destroy battery if you fall to side
[2022-06-14T15:27:42] Happy Giraffe: Would mainly avoid a 2000€ batt bill
[2022-06-14T15:27:44] Mirono escooters: I imagine he will
[2022-06-14T15:28:07] Mirono escooters: Thanks for reminder i still have to do that my batt always hangs out of sides haha
[2022-06-14T15:28:11] Mirono escooters: Forgot a velcro
[2022-06-14T15:29:09] francois schempers: yup, those 4 tesla cells are gonna be wide as fuck ^^
[2022-06-14T15:29:24] francois schempers: plus this motor look dope http://www.qs-motor.com/product/qsmotor-12000w-17inch-in-wheel-hub-motor-with-6-0x17-rim/
[2022-06-14T15:29:36] Mirono escooters: Hub motors look so good indeed
[2022-06-14T15:31:19] francois schempers: the packs are around 7cm wide, so 4 of them with spacer are gonna get me 40cm wide battery pack
[2022-06-14T15:31:30] Mirono escooters: 🥰
[2022-06-14T15:56:31] Happy Giraffe: You don't want li-ion?😂
[2022-06-14T15:57:16] Happy Giraffe: How much power/capacity does the lifepo give vs. Li-ion on same size? Assuming you use like Samsung 48x cells at 12A
[2022-06-14T16:12:36] Unknown: I looked briefly into the rabbit hole of using lipo's for our use. Main problems right off the rip were mounting/securing multiple single packs, wiring would probably be a mess and the toughest part I think is charging. Parallel groups can be charged together but if you're in the 16s-20s range, most Lipo chargers like iCharger Duo only go up to 6s and 7s, so would need to disconnect the series connections before each charge. Output would be superior to lithium cylindrical cells and capacity probably would as well. Lots of bike guys use pouch cells which can be high discharge (like 10c) , high charge (like 5c) and large capacity. EIG C020 pouch cells were supposedly amazing but I think EIG no longer makes them or is in business
[2022-06-14T16:13:56] Mirono escooters: You can just use a regular bms for lipo
[2022-06-14T16:14:32] Mirono escooters: Main problems are safety tho, especially mounting it And price
[2022-06-14T16:15:01] Unknown: But I think the charging process would still be an issue
[2022-06-14T16:15:07] Mirono escooters: Why
[2022-06-14T16:15:11] Mirono escooters: Li ion and lipo same process
[2022-06-14T16:19:06] Happy Giraffe: He mistakes lifepo as lipo I think
[2022-06-14T16:19:07] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-06-14T16:19:16] Mirono escooters: Yea i think so
[2022-06-14T16:20:23] Happy Giraffe: 20kg of rc lipo under seat would be nice
[2022-06-14T16:20:52] Mirono escooters: Especially when it gets a little little dent
[2022-06-14T16:21:03] Happy Giraffe: When the chemistry randomly wants to fail on one, you fly 5 meters high in a second
[2022-06-14T16:21:23] Mirono escooters: You beat elon musk to mars..
[2022-06-14T16:22:22] Happy Giraffe: Your brain propably makes you believe you went there nanosecond before you die😂

[2022-06-14T16:54:43] Happy Giraffe: But it seems the front is hotter so conducting some more heat there👍

[2022-06-14T17:30:29] Martin Kaktits: i mean, ali can have shit of any kind. One instance is not proof of anything. It might just be that particular seller
[2022-06-14T17:36:06] Mirono escooters: Is shortening brake lever magura even doable or should i ziptie excess tubing away☻️
[2022-06-14T17:42:19] Martin Kaktits: i had same with metallic and semi metallic. They either wore down very fast or ware shitty in the cold or both

[2022-06-14T23:10:21] Happy Giraffe: Why🙈
[2022-06-14T23:10:42] Mirono escooters: ;)
[2022-06-14T23:10:46] Mirono escooters: I want cooling
[2022-06-14T23:10:58] Mirono escooters: Someoone gotta be the first to do it
[2022-06-14T23:11:11] Paolo ⁭: Is not that the way to use thermal pad
[2022-06-14T23:11:12] Happy Giraffe: Those heatsinks maybe cool 2w Armv7 chip
[2022-06-14T23:11:19] Paolo ⁭: Need super high pressure torque🥐
[2022-06-14T23:11:26] Mirono escooters: ×50
[2022-06-14T23:11:41] Mirono escooters: Im sure they do more when 65kmh air passes em
[2022-06-14T23:11:43] Happy Giraffe: Nope, just buy turbinators
[2022-06-14T23:11:58] Mirono escooters: Yea 120€ with ship and tax
[2022-06-14T23:12:03] Happy Giraffe: Used 40€ already on crap
[2022-06-14T23:12:11] Happy Giraffe: Not that much more afterall🌚
[2022-06-14T23:12:28] Happy Giraffe: And you can sell it later forwards 80€
[2022-06-14T23:12:31] Mirono escooters: If this works i can do it on almost any hub
[2022-06-14T23:12:35] Mirono escooters: Its not only for this
[2022-06-14T23:12:59] Mirono escooters: Ssht ill be the experimenter before and after and thermal image
[2022-06-14T23:13:00] Happy Giraffe: Not really a way to test but you can do what you want😂
[2022-06-14T23:13:07] sombre_enfant: Brother aint focused
[2022-06-14T23:13:34] Happy Giraffe: You cant test motors at all from side
[2022-06-14T23:13:49] Mirono escooters: Eh, side?
[2022-06-14T23:13:49] Happy Giraffe: Motor needs so much time to warm up
[2022-06-14T23:13:57] Mirono escooters: Temp sensor internal
[2022-06-14T23:14:00] Mirono escooters: ._.
[2022-06-14T23:14:12] Happy Giraffe: If you have that a bit better
[2022-06-14T23:14:25] Happy Giraffe: But still cant really accurately compare
[2022-06-14T23:14:25] Mirono escooters: With ff after 5 min heat got dissappeated to side quickly already so good upgrade
[2022-06-14T23:14:28] Mirono escooters: I got that yes
[2022-06-14T23:14:42] Mirono escooters: Ill make before after and try to have +- same load
[2022-06-14T23:15:05] Happy Giraffe: Yeah no need for tiny heatsinks, you really want a hubsink with thermal paste and good mount pressure
[2022-06-14T23:15:12] Mirono escooters: Eh its just for fun. Dont take life so seriously, no one gets out alive anyway 😀
[2022-06-14T23:15:23] Happy Giraffe: But even then the side is bottleneck
[2022-06-14T23:15:47] Happy Giraffe: I mean hotglue is fun and all but dont build a house with it😂
[2022-06-14T23:16:00] Mirono escooters: Dont..challenge me
[2022-06-14T23:16:16] Mirono escooters: The box you sended will be added to my house walls :)
[2022-06-14T23:16:21] Mirono escooters: (Joke)
[2022-06-14T23:16:37] Happy Giraffe: Its not my best box but atleast its built properly then😂
[2022-06-14T23:17:40] Mirono escooters: Will be hurricane proof
[2022-06-14T23:19:44] Happy Giraffe: Btw do you guys have maxed out home insurances as you do DIY?
[2022-06-14T23:20:18] Happy Giraffe: Atleast for me gives small peace of mind if batt destroys floor on fire I pay just 250€😅
[2022-06-14T23:20:28] Mirono escooters: I have workroom
[2022-06-14T23:20:42] Mirono escooters: Worst case is that some thousands euro material burns but atleast no house
[2022-06-14T23:24:15] Happy Giraffe: Would be luxury, I try to create myself 4m2 space amd be happy with it lol. Total flat will be 25 so not that much...
[2022-06-14T23:28:39] Mirono escooters: Im very happy i got garden and workroom
[2022-06-14T23:32:42] Unknown: If we were buy a pair of the turbinators or grin hubsinks, which ebike motor version would be the best to use size wise? Any ideas?
[2022-06-14T23:33:12] Mirono escooters: For scoot? None
[2022-06-14T23:33:31] Unknown: Yea... I know. But can we bend or make any of them work??
[2022-06-14T23:34:04] Mirono escooters: Im afraid no
[2022-06-14T23:34:29] Mirono escooters: Also how youd connect that? Where hub motor heatsink is, escooter has tire haha
[2022-06-14T23:38:07] Happy Giraffe: Turbinators made to fit between bike spokes in middle of wheel
[2022-06-14T23:39:09] Mirono escooters: How.
[2022-06-14T23:39:14] Mirono escooters: Shit design

[2022-06-14T23:40:00] Mirono escooters: Am still gonna print that 1 day
[2022-06-14T23:40:29] Happy Giraffe: I might buy a 3D printer aswell, will see if I have time for that on my holidays
[2022-06-14T23:41:27] Mirono escooters: Its such a good investment
[2022-06-14T23:42:14] Happy Giraffe: I might try to get a used cheapo one just to learn, can build bigger parts like battery cases in lego pieces and then 2-comp glue together😅
[2022-06-14T23:43:48] Mirono escooters: Ender 3 is so good starter
[2022-06-14T23:44:00] Mirono escooters: Most build batt cases in multiple pieces
[2022-06-14T23:44:09] Mirono escooters: I got belt printer but dont go down that rabbit hole..
[2022-06-14T23:45:11] Happy Giraffe: Also buying lego blocks and gluing together solid option😂

[2022-06-15T12:00:04] Luis Magalhaes: Thats speed is must be scary as shit 😂😂
[2022-06-15T12:01:23] Mirono escooters: I cant imagine how ridong that must feel
[2022-06-15T12:14:31] Luis Magalhaes: Me neither
[2022-06-15T12:14:58] Mirono escooters: Ebike at 70 is already oempf
[2022-06-15T12:15:05] Mirono escooters: And i see that as more stable
[2022-06-15T12:15:37] Luis Magalhaes: The owner says it push you back and he gets tired from the leg at the back of doing oposite force 😂
[2022-06-15T12:16:00] Mirono escooters: I imagine thar

[2022-06-15T12:56:34] Face de Pin Sucé: I need a little bigger battery, I only have 6P so huge sag at full speed
[2022-06-15T13:12:05] Luis Magalhaes: Yes i kmow mate you posted your log was just messing with you 😜 dont need more amps if your sag is lower it goes faster 💪
[2022-06-15T13:12:41] Face de Pin Sucé: I'll try to get a external 2-3P battery
[2022-06-15T13:12:52] Face de Pin Sucé: To break 150Kmh
[2022-06-15T13:13:05] Face de Pin Sucé: But this will need more amps
[2022-06-15T13:13:40] sombre_enfant: And stay on 16s???
[2022-06-15T13:13:53] Face de Pin Sucé: No, I'm in 20S on compact
[2022-06-15T13:13:57] Luis Magalhaes: <animation>
[2022-06-15T13:14:12] Mirono escooters: How much amps is more amps
[2022-06-15T13:14:26] Luis Magalhaes: Don't forget to see if gopro is filming 😂😂😜
[2022-06-15T13:14:27] Face de Pin Sucé: I don't know, we'll see after tests
[2022-06-15T13:14:37] Face de Pin Sucé: Fucking GoPro 😂
[2022-06-15T13:14:55] Mirono escooters: Theoretically u can calculate if u know 2 values
[2022-06-15T13:15:18] Mirono escooters: U know amp draw for 50 and 100? Ill test for.my exam tomorrow
[2022-06-15T13:15:49] Face de Pin Sucé: Have a friend that knows and made an excel for this
[2022-06-15T13:15:51] Mirono escooters: Hoi
[2022-06-15T13:15:58] Face de Pin Sucé: But this needs a lot of datas
[2022-06-15T13:16:00] Mirono escooters: Aha even better
[2022-06-15T13:16:13] sombre_enfant: Theory and real isnt same if you dont do all little factor...
[2022-06-15T13:16:14] Face de Pin Sucé: Weight, wind, motor, esc, battery, cells, size,...
[2022-06-15T13:16:19] Face de Pin Sucé: And he doesn't share for now
[2022-06-15T13:16:37] Mirono escooters: Yes but its a good average..
[2022-06-15T13:16:42] Face de Pin Sucé: For now, we have accurate results between theory and reality
[2022-06-15T13:16:50] Mirono escooters: Physisist do approx calculations then test irl haha
[2022-06-15T13:17:08] Face de Pin Sucé: He used my setups to have better results, I gave him a lot of logs
[2022-06-15T13:17:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Like 40-50 logs of very different rides, setups, powers,...
[2022-06-15T13:42:35] Artem Bulashev: 😁😁 how to fit 60v 30ah 21700 into small vsett9 🫣🤣🤣 Over Engineered ? 😁😁 Have 2 5mm aluminum rods going through all on front and back - to interlock them together
[2022-06-15T13:42:55] Mirono escooters: Never
[2022-06-15T13:42:59] Mirono escooters: Beauty
[2022-06-15T13:50:17] Artem Bulashev: ❤️😁
[2022-06-15T13:56:35] Unknown: That looks awesome man. 60v with 30ah in Vsett 9, that is straight up impressive. Will it require a deck spacer at all? Using dual ubox I assume? On my 10+ the added weight in the deck makes the scooter feel more planted and secure. More weight at the center of gravity is a good feeling.
[2022-06-15T13:57:31] Mirono escooters: Thats 1 thing i miss on ebike Scoot center gravity is so low w batter
[2022-06-15T14:12:07] Artem Bulashev: Man I love when printer dimensional accuracy is with in 0.05mm even on circles 🤣🤣
[2022-06-15T14:13:15] Artem Bulashev: Yeah, but lower or same as my first deisgn 60v 28ah (16s8p 18650 35e Samsung)
[2022-06-15T14:13:40] Mirono escooters: Circles is indeed impressive
[2022-06-15T14:14:46] Artem Bulashev: Considering it is printed 60mms perimeter and 150mms infill 🥹 yeah I’m happy with that PETG profile now (0.4mm wide 0.3mm high layer for better speed)
[2022-06-15T14:16:30] Unknown: Gotcha gotcha... The deck spacer also shortens the stem/cockpit. A buddy with a stock 10+ rode mine the other day and loved how the cockpit was more compact. That 3/4" deck spacer makes the bars feel 3/4" lower which helps with keeping things stable... In addition to the added weight in the deck 👍
[2022-06-15T14:17:50] Unknown: Alternatively, I rode his stock 10+ 😂. Nothing on it except 291r shocks. Felt like the good old days lol. Sooo strange especially without the damper. Power felt disappointing and underwhelming but I know it's fast out of the box.
[2022-06-15T14:20:00] Unknown: @artBula any good word on the throttle? Your 3d holders look really clean and well thought out. I'd expect nothing less 😜
[2022-06-15T14:20:15] Luis Magalhaes: Did you mesure the 0-100 with draggy on that one? 😁
[2022-06-15T14:20:38] Face de Pin Sucé: No, because I know it's not good
[2022-06-15T14:20:59] Face de Pin Sucé: High KV motors, not enough amp to have a good 0-100
[2022-06-15T14:21:35] Luis Magalhaes: Ok 👍 thats a high speed one for now 😂
[2022-06-15T14:23:41] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes 😂
[2022-06-15T14:23:53] Face de Pin Sucé: The truth is, it wasn't supposed to go at that speed
[2022-06-15T14:24:03] Face de Pin Sucé: I mean, it wasn't the point
[2022-06-15T14:24:17] Face de Pin Sucé: I wanted it to have the best torque around 50Kmh (because race scooter)
[2022-06-15T14:24:40] Face de Pin Sucé: So in the end of corner, full throttle and max torque
[2022-06-15T14:24:52] Face de Pin Sucé: And it works perfectly for that
[2022-06-15T14:25:06] Face de Pin Sucé: Then I tested max speed and was surprised 😂
[2022-06-15T14:32:17] Luis Magalhaes: A good surprise 😂😂😂

[2022-06-15T23:53:23] sombre_enfant: U work in machining with a suit ???
[2022-06-15T23:54:06] rosheee: no but the company where i work does custom stuff by itself and has a division for it ^^' a whole building
[2022-06-15T23:55:29] Unknown: Roscheeee doesn't strike me as a suit guy
[2022-06-15T23:55:30] rosheee: i do IT stuff create/upgrade/development of new environments for big ass medical measuring devices
[2022-06-15T23:55:38] rosheee: i wear suits ^^
[2022-06-15T23:56:04] Mirono escooters: Sounds like it earns good
[2022-06-15T23:56:14] Unknown: Do you also speak like a gentleman at work? 😭
[2022-06-15T23:56:51] rosheee: ofc 😆
[2022-06-15T23:56:52] Happy Giraffe: Hahahhahahha
[2022-06-15T23:57:05] rosheee: not with colleagues
[2022-06-15T23:57:11] rosheee: depends ^^'
[2022-06-15T23:57:18] Happy Giraffe: "Hello lady, would you mind having a nice cuppaov tea"?
[2022-06-15T23:57:31] rosheee: we're a dick squad with 2 vags
[2022-06-15T23:57:43] sombre_enfant: Now say it in german

[2022-06-15T23:57:44] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-06-15T23:57:57] Happy Giraffe: Would sound like a threat
[2022-06-15T23:58:10] rosheee: hmm 😆i don't ask that
[2022-06-15T23:58:35] Unknown: Too funny too funny

[2022-06-16T00:00:49] rosheee: ah 😆after work i gonna work on scooters cuz next 2 days i get new gear for kaabo
[2022-06-16T00:02:25] rosheee: yah the job isn't something i've done before
[2022-06-16T00:02:39] rosheee: ^^' it's pretty hardcore
[2022-06-16T00:02:53] Happy Giraffe: Bro doing 2x shift to afford vescs
[2022-06-16T00:03:59] rosheee: no
[2022-06-16T00:04:07] rosheee: get paid per hour consultant ^^
[2022-06-16T00:04:57] Happy Giraffe: But then its already 6 + 6 so almost double
[2022-06-16T00:05:03] rosheee: lol
[2022-06-16T00:05:10] rosheee: 6 hour xD?
[2022-06-16T00:05:20] rosheee: never worked less than 8.5 in my life
[2022-06-16T00:05:38] Happy Giraffe: Thats why I said almost
[2022-06-16T00:06:28] rosheee: and they forbid me to work more than 10h ^^'
[2022-06-16T00:06:43] Happy Giraffe: Nice bonuses incoming
[2022-06-16T00:06:48] rosheee: no bonus
[2022-06-16T00:06:51] rosheee: when u're internal then yes
[2022-06-16T00:06:55] Happy Giraffe: Lol
[2022-06-16T00:06:58] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-06-16T00:06:59] rosheee: then omg
[2022-06-16T00:07:18] Happy Giraffe: Bro getting done no lube
[2022-06-16T00:07:45] rosheee: yah but it's not like couple of years ago ....things changed there
[2022-06-16T00:28:30] Happy Giraffe: Bikes are sold out everywhere atm, grrrr
[2022-06-16T00:29:34] Happy Giraffe: Im getting really fucked, would haved loved to buy from local store. Interesting to see how ebike handles vs scooter. I think less agile 29" tires vs 10"
[2022-06-16T00:30:44] Mirono escooters: It rides way better
[2022-06-16T00:30:53] Mirono escooters: Maybr look on marketplace
[2022-06-16T00:35:22] Happy Giraffe: I kinda found best specs, one gear in front and 10 in back. Other design also good. People ask crazy prices on used bikes🌚
[2022-06-16T00:44:23] Mirono escooters: I got mine from friend :)
[2022-06-16T00:44:37] Mirono escooters: In parts, i learned how it was build immediately
[2022-06-16T00:51:58] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-06-16T01:04:23] Mirko Boni: Hi everyone! The G30 dual motor project has started today! I ordered Sony vtc6a 16s 6P 21700 battery with bms ant, I also ordered 2 blade motors!
[2022-06-16T01:05:10] rosheee: good order PMT as well
[2022-06-16T01:05:22] rosheee: and use proper brake adapter to frame
[2022-06-16T01:05:29] Mirko Boni: Now I have to decide which vesc to install! 75100 or ubox V2? This is the dilemma!
[2022-06-16T01:05:32] rosheee: ubox
[2022-06-16T01:05:33] rosheee: def.
[2022-06-16T01:06:20] rosheee: when 16S6P build proper then u can do this
[2022-06-16T01:06:21] Mirko Boni: I have been using the 4-piston magura in my G30 for a few months now!
[2022-06-16T01:06:46] Mirko Boni: Yess!
[2022-06-16T01:06:53] rosheee: <photos/photo_4893@14-06-2022_00-51-22.jpg>
[2022-06-16T01:07:03] rosheee: front ubox and then 16S6P
[2022-06-16T01:07:07] rosheee: fits perfectly
[2022-06-16T01:07:27] Mirko Boni: Do you think 50 amps are good for each blade motor?
[2022-06-16T01:07:39] rosheee: battery?
[2022-06-16T01:07:52] rosheee: u have to ask @PaoloWu but i think u can push much more ^^
[2022-06-16T01:08:05] Mirko Boni: Sony vtc6a cells
[2022-06-16T01:08:22] Mirko Boni: Miata 21700
[2022-06-16T01:09:06] Mirko Boni: Paolo wu manages to deliver 70A to each motor
[2022-06-16T01:09:30] rosheee: battery amps?
[2022-06-16T01:09:32] rosheee: lol
[2022-06-16T01:09:38] rosheee: he can do more, not?
[2022-06-16T01:09:47] rosheee: i use 70A battery on vsett 10+motors
[2022-06-16T01:09:59] rosheee: and 135A phase per motor Adam use much more
[2022-06-16T01:10:09] Mirko Boni: Paolo wu 18S! I don't know the Amps in his battery!
[2022-06-16T01:10:50] rosheee: but phase u can push 180A per motor i think
[2022-06-16T01:10:54] rosheee: battery 70A no prob
[2022-06-16T01:11:06] Mirko Boni: What is the difference between vsett 10 and blade motors?
[2022-06-16T01:11:17] Mirko Boni: Thank you
[2022-06-16T01:11:31] rosheee: idk never tested blade
[2022-06-16T01:11:44] Mirko Boni: Ok ok!
[2022-06-16T01:11:54] rosheee: i had them but they were broken
[2022-06-16T01:11:59] rosheee: but paolo is fanboy
[2022-06-16T01:12:16] Mirko Boni: Have you installed the ubox v2 vertically?
[2022-06-16T01:15:22] rosheee: no 😆can't u see it?
[2022-06-16T01:16:08] Mirko Boni: Isn't that gray a protection?
[2022-06-16T01:16:34] Mirko Boni: Ok! I get it, it's horizontal!
[2022-06-16T01:17:00] Happy Giraffe: Yes batt current, but 100A phase
[2022-06-16T01:17:00] rosheee: where? that silver stuff is the ubox v1 75V without the black color on it
[2022-06-16T01:17:15] Mirko Boni: https://spintend.com/products/75v-200a-dual-motor-controller-ubox-based-on-vesc
[2022-06-16T01:17:24] rosheee: yes
[2022-06-16T01:17:25] Happy Giraffe: Ubox can do 120A phase no issues
[2022-06-16T01:17:29] rosheee: 135A
[2022-06-16T01:17:35] rosheee: also 180A no prob
[2022-06-16T01:17:41] rosheee: 90A battery
[2022-06-16T01:17:44] rosheee: but going hot
[2022-06-16T01:18:12] rosheee: using 135A motor current max 180A current max 70A battery current max = no prob
[2022-06-16T01:18:18] Mirko Boni: 90A for each motor?
[2022-06-16T01:18:20] rosheee: maxed out stock FW settings
[2022-06-16T01:18:27] rosheee: don't do that 😆u need special FW for it
[2022-06-16T01:18:33] rosheee: better use more battery current rear and less front
[2022-06-16T01:18:52] Mirko Boni: Ok! Perfect!
[2022-06-16T01:18:53] rosheee: i use 70A rear and 55A front cuz battery can't deliver more
[2022-06-16T01:19:10] rosheee: with 135A phase max 180A current max each esc
[2022-06-16T01:19:23] Happy Giraffe: Too much for blade
[2022-06-16T01:19:26] rosheee: rly?
[2022-06-16T01:19:28] Mirko Boni: So if I understand, does 50A at each motor make the ubox too hot?
[2022-06-16T01:19:33] rosheee: no
[2022-06-16T01:19:38] rosheee: 90A makes it hot
[2022-06-16T01:19:46] Happy Giraffe: Battery current you mean?
[2022-06-16T01:19:55] Happy Giraffe: Motor current is different
[2022-06-16T01:20:24] Mirko Boni: Yess
[2022-06-16T01:20:41] Unknown: Vsett 10 motors I run 80a batt / 225a phase on rear motor and is perfectly fine with ferrofluid
[2022-06-16T01:20:41] Mirko Boni: Exactly
[2022-06-16T01:21:15] rosheee: but u said they overheat
[2022-06-16T01:21:40] Unknown: They don't overheat. I told you 175F max so far at the windings.
[2022-06-16T01:21:46] Mirko Boni: When I say 50 Amps I mean non-phase battery current!
[2022-06-16T01:21:54] Unknown: I want motor cooler or hubsinks for added protection in the summer
[2022-06-16T01:22:05] rosheee: 😆motor cooler D?
[2022-06-16T01:22:14] rosheee: take of the color
[2022-06-16T01:23:05] rosheee: add more ferrofluid
[2022-06-16T01:23:07] Unknown: I dunno lol. Something to help dissipate heat and work with ferrofluid. Rear motor with higher settings has not come close to overheating... 80C max at windings
[2022-06-16T01:23:15] rosheee: yah lol
[2022-06-16T01:23:18] rosheee: add more fluid
[2022-06-16T01:23:23] Unknown: Diminishing returns and rolling resistance
[2022-06-16T01:23:27] rosheee: i added more yesterday
[2022-06-16T01:23:36] Unknown: More isn't always the answer 😝
[2022-06-16T01:23:47] rosheee: but it had like 2mm between the magnets left
[2022-06-16T01:24:07] rosheee: take off color from the covers
[2022-06-16T01:24:11] Mirko Boni: But a vsett motor, or blade, up to what temperature can it work?
[2022-06-16T01:25:08] rosheee: on the settings u use it should go like a fucking rocket
[2022-06-16T01:26:39] Happy Giraffe: Blade motors should be tested with thermal sensor,
[2022-06-16T01:27:12] Mirko Boni: I have the infrared gun
[2022-06-16T01:27:32] rosheee: doesn't work
[2022-06-16T01:27:38] rosheee: cuz outside temp not = inside temp
[2022-06-16T01:27:46] rosheee: and material difference and and and
[2022-06-16T01:28:10] Mirko Boni: <video_file>
[2022-06-16T01:28:16] Happy Giraffe: Otherwise hard to say anything, without ferrofluid my motor cover was warm but not hot. That gives indication inside was hotter than outside atleast lol
[2022-06-16T01:28:22] Happy Giraffe: Useless for motor
[2022-06-16T01:29:11] Mirko Boni: I usually add 10 degrees celsius
[2022-06-16T01:29:13] rosheee: lol 😆wtf
[2022-06-16T01:29:31] Mirko Boni: ? 😔
[2022-06-16T01:29:52] Happy Giraffe: Still useless
[2022-06-16T01:29:59] rosheee: yes
[2022-06-16T01:30:01] Happy Giraffe: Inside can be 100°c and outside 35°c
[2022-06-16T01:30:11] Mirko Boni: 😱😱😱😱
[2022-06-16T01:30:15] rosheee: and don't try measure mosfet temp on bottomplate
[2022-06-16T01:30:23] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-06-16T01:31:03] Mirko Boni: So am I in danger of burning?
[2022-06-16T01:31:42] Happy Giraffe: Ofc as you dont know anything what happens inside, can only guess
[2022-06-16T01:32:06] Happy Giraffe: But having awd and 50A batt 120A phase on each is ok. Add ferrofluid and should be fine
[2022-06-16T01:32:17] Mirko Boni: This is Paolo wu 800w motor! My battery current firmware can deliver 37 Amps
[2022-06-16T01:32:41] Happy Giraffe: If it's blade motor is same that I had
[2022-06-16T01:33:16] Mirko Boni: Paolo wu told me it is 1200w blade motor
[2022-06-16T01:34:08] rosheee: i have 2 sleep
[2022-06-16T01:34:09] rosheee: gn8
[2022-06-16T01:34:21] Unknown: Ohh, it's a fuckin rocket 🚀 🤓
[2022-06-16T01:34:28] rosheee: send videos
[2022-06-16T01:34:32] rosheee: AND DATA SHEETS WITH TEMP XD
[2022-06-16T01:35:40] Happy Giraffe: Its same what I have then 50/120A ok
[2022-06-16T01:35:56] Happy Giraffe: If you have awd the motors get stressed less than my single one
[2022-06-16T01:36:00] Unknown: <animation>
[2022-06-16T01:36:22] Mirko Boni: Thank you! 😊😊😊
[2022-06-16T01:36:59] rosheee: then all fake
[2022-06-16T01:37:02] Unknown: I have pushed over 6kw thru my rear Vsett 10 motor and over 5kw thru my front
[2022-06-16T01:37:03] Happy Giraffe: If weather outside is +30°c and you have many hills then better be easy on throttle. Adding ferrofluid is kind of must also.
[2022-06-16T01:37:11] Unknown: Who do I have to impress?
[2022-06-16T01:37:14] rosheee: yeh i pushed rear to 10kw
[2022-06-16T01:37:19] rosheee: NOT ABOUT IMPRESSING
[2022-06-16T01:37:20] Happy Giraffe: Motors heat up slowly but takes 15-30minutes to cool down even a little
[2022-06-16T01:37:22] Unknown: I know what I ride 😎
[2022-06-16T01:37:31] Unknown: Lol
[2022-06-16T01:37:32] rosheee: for what u need data?
[2022-06-16T01:37:39] Mirko Boni: Does the vesc software allow you to choose different Amps for the front and rear motor?
[2022-06-16T01:37:42] rosheee: i wanna prepare
[2022-06-16T01:37:53] rosheee: and see what is possible
[2022-06-16T01:37:55] Happy Giraffe: Ye
[2022-06-16T01:37:58] Mirko Boni: Wow 😱
[2022-06-16T01:38:01] rosheee: and what happens to controller
[2022-06-16T01:38:11] Unknown: Umm... A Nucular 12F... Nothing
[2022-06-16T01:38:12] rosheee: if i receive my nucular shit and temp. go sky high
[2022-06-16T01:38:21] Unknown: Rated at 150a battery and 250a phase
[2022-06-16T01:38:23] rosheee: omg
[2022-06-16T01:38:29] Happy Giraffe: Mentioned nucular, here we go again😂😂😂😂
[2022-06-16T01:38:31] rosheee: why u wont send logfiles
[2022-06-16T01:38:36] Unknown: Fuckkkk
[2022-06-16T01:38:41] rosheee: what is the problem
[2022-06-16T01:38:42] Unknown: <photos/photo_4928@16-06-2022_01-38-42.jpg>
[2022-06-16T01:38:44] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-06-16T01:38:44] Mirko Boni: I have no hills! My path is flat!
[2022-06-16T01:38:56] Happy Giraffe: Then its ok
[2022-06-16T01:39:05] rosheee: u said u send them
[2022-06-16T01:39:11] Mirko Boni: Ok perfect!
[2022-06-16T01:39:23] Happy Giraffe: Still want to add ferrofluid and seal motor cover with silicone tho
[2022-06-16T01:39:24] rosheee: once u send like u mentioned i STFU FOREVER
[2022-06-16T01:39:34] Mirko Boni: Thanks for your help!
[2022-06-16T01:39:41] rosheee: and i have no temp. sensor in motors
[2022-06-16T01:39:53] Happy Giraffe: (x) doubt
[2022-06-16T01:39:54] Unknown: Rear potted 12F never has gotten above 85F/30C... Ever
[2022-06-16T01:39:59] rosheee: THEN SEND THE SHEET
[2022-06-16T01:40:05] Unknown: And front runs cooler since lower settings
[2022-06-16T01:40:11] rosheee: then send sheet pls
[2022-06-16T01:40:19] Unknown: You think I'm lying?
[2022-06-16T01:40:26] rosheee: omfg
[2022-06-16T01:40:27] Mirko Boni: But where does fluid iron go? Does it not act in the windings?
[2022-06-16T01:40:28] Unknown: Haha
[2022-06-16T01:40:55] rosheee: what's the big deal by sending them?
[2022-06-16T01:40:59] Unknown: No effect on that kind of stuff. Non conductive
[2022-06-16T01:41:17] Unknown: I don't have a temp log. Told you I would when I log it. I'm messing with you
[2022-06-16T01:41:47] rosheee: XD I PAID NOW 1200$ to nucular for the fucking controllers
[2022-06-16T01:41:48] Mirko Boni: So the windings are immersed in the ferrofluid?
[2022-06-16T01:41:56] Unknown: But I absolutely promise you my controller temps have never gone above 87F I think it was a hot day hard ride with 80/225
[2022-06-16T01:42:16] Unknown: You'll be happier with them than any shits you've been running
[2022-06-16T01:42:18] Happy Giraffe: No, tiny bit between magnets

[2022-06-16T01:57:04] D J: also here in Portugal it is very hot right now. today I got 39°c and UBOX was not very happy with these temperatures 😂
[2022-06-16T01:58:17] Mirko Boni: What temperatures are you reaching in the ubox?
[2022-06-16T01:59:56] rosheee: nobody shares temps.

[2022-06-16T02:48:15] Unknown: Because temps aren't an issue bro. Unless you're running monster cromotor at 350a batt and 500a phase on a 24F, temps aren't an issue. Using a 6F or 12F on any scooter, you will melt the motor or blow your battery before you overheat the controller. Temps are a non-issue for me so why would I be so focused on logging them and paying close attention to them. The only concern I have is pushing my motors too hard
[2022-06-16T02:48:45] rosheee: Dude

[2022-06-16T02:49:50] Unknown: And ...?
[2022-06-16T02:50:33] Unknown: You don't even know the load they're running bro. That's a manufacturer stress test
[2022-06-16T02:50:51] Unknown: They're stressing the controller to failure to find limits
[2022-06-16T02:53:29] Unknown: And he programmed shut off at 80C lol. You can run them to whatever max temp you set. You find 2 screenshots online with no information to back them up and think there's a problem? You follow the Nuc chat, how many times you hear guys complaining about controller temps? Basically never. And there are guys running 20-30kw setups.
[2022-06-16T03:00:33] Happy Giraffe: I havent needed to do it myself, on a scootermoto you can take the core "stator" out aswell
[2022-06-16T03:01:38] Happy Giraffe: Always remember to wear safety glasses as magnetic force is strong when putting it back. Nanoparticle fluid will be hard to take out of your eyes if it gets there
[2022-06-16T03:06:05] rosheee: 24F looks like decent product
[2022-06-16T03:07:29] rosheee: Guy uses it in car lol
[2022-06-16T03:07:40] rosheee: 55C max temp while go max retard
[2022-06-16T03:09:41] rosheee: 300A bat 500a phase
[2022-06-16T03:10:40] rosheee: Someone I know is Russia is running a 150v Kelly and doing 500 phase amps at 134v. He tops out at 200 km/h and 0-100 in 4.3 seconds. Admittedly it is an isolated sinusoidal controller and not FOC. There's lots of untapped potential in your controller designs for more of everything.
[2022-06-16T03:10:47] rosheee: Lol
[2022-06-16T03:11:31] rosheee: Easy
[2022-06-16T03:11:37] rosheee: XD i believe u
[2022-06-16T03:11:52] rosheee: Gonna check what parts they used when i get it
[2022-06-16T03:20:24] Happy Giraffe: 0-100 needs a lot of grip for those numbers🌚
[2022-06-16T03:22:08] rosheee: Yup
[2022-06-16T03:31:38] Unknown: After using them if I thought they were shit, I wouldn't stand behind and I would have 4 of their controllers sitting in my house lol. I have a solid 600-650 miles (1000km or so) on my 12Fs. Honestly dual 12Fs are probably more than enough for 95% of scooters out there. The other 5% 70mm magnet monsters with 4awg phase wires can definitely benefit from dual 24Fs. They aren't limitless but they perform up to what the spec sheets say. A 24F is definitely not as capable as an ASI BAC8000 or fardriver 530. They aren't the most powerful in the world but they work great when you use them properly. 2 of my controllers (12F and 24F) came from a guy in Australia who used them for racing dirt bikes... In the Australia heat for 2-3 years. Now I'm using them and they work just as good as the day they were shipped new from Russia. There is definitely something to be said for that.
[2022-06-16T03:40:39] rosheee: Yah
[2022-06-16T03:40:53] rosheee: They are also idk how many x the size of what i use xD
[2022-06-16T03:40:58] Unknown: Only difference between 6,12,24 is the number of fets and power capabilities/limits and obviously total MOSFET IR due to the different number of fets in parallel. Design, hardware, software are all identical. Literally pick your power and they are all equally good. Cool thing is you can run a 12F in the front and 24F in the rear or 6 and 12 or whatever combo
[2022-06-16T03:41:07] rosheee: But for next project i try 2x24f
[2022-06-16T03:41:47] rosheee: Mount then outside xD cuz it isnt for street and daily use
[2022-06-16T03:43:41] Unknown: The size is supposedly some of the smallest size/power ratio out there for controllers like this. ASI, sabvoton, votol, Sinetech, etc... are all much bigger for an equal power unit
[2022-06-16T03:43:58] Unknown: That's what all the big Boyz do 😎
[2022-06-16T03:44:36] rosheee: ^^'
[2022-06-16T03:44:56] rosheee: scooter should look "stock"
[2022-06-16T03:45:14] rosheee: if police catches me with outside esc i'm done
[2022-06-16T03:45:17] rosheee: also cuz rain

[2022-06-16T09:22:23] Konstantin: 12fets, can provide such power to turn suron motor, but Chinese 18 FETs, do it... So...I don't believe on nuc metrics... Only 1 shunt, and time to calculate all, y it not a problem, but to much magic value, like prong current and etc...
[2022-06-16T09:25:28] Konstantin: 12 FETs

[2022-06-16T11:55:03] rosheee: No xD
[2022-06-16T11:55:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: on vesc ? jst-ph 2.0
[2022-06-16T11:56:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for most of them...
[2022-06-16T11:57:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: anyone has formula to calculate mean phase amps from 3 phases currents ?
[2022-06-16T11:58:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and mean phase voltage from 2 phase voltages ?
[2022-06-16T12:00:21] rosheee: Divide the power consumption in watts by the line voltage multiplied by the power factor to find the amperage. For three phase circuits the power factor is the square root of 3. If your calculator doesn’t have a square root function, use 1.73 as an approximation of the square root of 3. For example, a three phase circuit using 25,000 watts of power and a line voltage of 250 will have a current flow of 25,000/(250 x 1.73), which is equal to 57.80 amperes.
[2022-06-16T12:01:09] rosheee: the power is the sum of the phase voltages multiplied by the line current = 2 x Vphase x Iphase.
[2022-06-16T12:27:23] rosheee: 2 much ferrofluid xD
[2022-06-16T12:27:26] rosheee: Holyshit

[2022-06-16T13:56:35] Happy Giraffe: 5ml should be enough for one maybe so then 10 would make two🤔
[2022-06-16T13:57:05] Paolo ⁭: Put motor oil and resolved
[2022-06-16T14:01:01] Artem Bulashev: Depends on motor size and magnet length

[2022-06-17T01:26:06] rosheee: i put 400euro value
[2022-06-17T01:26:10] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-06-17T01:27:06] Happy Giraffe: Yes🌚
[2022-06-17T01:27:23] Happy Giraffe: Im not that big of a dickhead afterall
[2022-06-17T01:27:52] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-06-17T01:32:41] Happy Giraffe: Trickstuff 203mm 50€ gg
[2022-06-17T01:32:48] Happy Giraffe: 2.05mm thick
[2022-06-17T01:34:52] Unknown: Slightly more power but not as much heat resistance
[2022-06-17T01:35:15] Unknown: I had to Google each of the German terms 🤣
[2022-06-17T01:38:34] Happy Giraffe: https://r2-bike.com/TRP-Brake-Disc-R1-23-mm-Thick-220-mm-6-Hole
[2022-06-17T01:38:40] Happy Giraffe: 2.3.mm stuff🌚
[2022-06-17T01:40:35] Unknown: Is it possible to underfill the Maguras to accommodate thicker than 2mm rotors? Probably not without leaving air in the system. I'm having trouble getting no rub on the 2mm rotors 🤦🏻
[2022-06-17T01:41:28] Unknown: Also think the Kool stop pads maybe a tiny bit thicker than stock Maguras. Tolerance is super tight and I bled with pistons fully retracted. Hmm
[2022-06-17T01:41:40] Happy Giraffe: Damn, carefully pushing pistons back should do it
[2022-06-17T01:41:47] Happy Giraffe: Yes
[2022-06-17T01:42:00] rosheee: ?
[2022-06-17T01:42:10] Unknown: Yea.. tried that. Bleed a few times actually with pistons fully retracted.
[2022-06-17T01:42:38] rosheee: trickstuff are 2,05mm
[2022-06-17T01:42:49] rosheee: ^^' never touched
[2022-06-17T01:42:49] Unknown: FYI... Magura pistons will pop directly out the calipers if you forget to use the piston blocks while bleeding 😝. Luckily they pop right back in
[2022-06-17T01:43:00] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-06-17T01:43:06] rosheee: XD yes happens
[2022-06-17T01:43:11] rosheee: but it should touch
[2022-06-17T01:43:19] Unknown: Yup... It happened 🙈
[2022-06-17T01:43:26] Happy Giraffe: Some people use bleeding blocks🌚
[2022-06-17T01:43:35] Unknown: LoL. The smart ones
[2022-06-17T01:43:42] rosheee: they come with the calipers ^^
[2022-06-17T01:43:53] Happy Giraffe: <animation>
[2022-06-17T01:44:06] rosheee: but 2,05mm discs + kool stop no prob
[2022-06-17T01:44:13] Unknown: Yup they do. Literally forgot to put them in place before my last bleed. Piston popped into the floor 🤣
[2022-06-17T01:44:14] rosheee: mt7/5 + mt8
[2022-06-17T01:44:14] Happy Giraffe: Adam wants to play life on "survival mode"
[2022-06-17T01:44:36] Unknown: Haha. Clancy Division
[2022-06-17T01:44:47] rosheee: rebleed them
[2022-06-17T01:44:51] Unknown: Live in the dark zone
[2022-06-17T01:45:12] Unknown: Of course. Already did. The piston popping out let in a fair amount of air 😭😭
[2022-06-17T01:45:45] Rowan Ross: Hot damn, 20s10p
[2022-06-17T01:45:56] rosheee: lol?
[2022-06-17T01:46:02] rosheee: i mean to fit disc + kool stop ^^
[2022-06-17T01:46:09] Unknown: Rode a solid 30 Miles after the piston pop incident. All is fine. Afterall, that's how they assemble the Pistons in the calipers at the factory
[2022-06-17T01:46:18] Happy Giraffe: <video_file>
[2022-06-17T01:46:20] Unknown: I'm going to try again
[2022-06-17T01:46:33] Happy Giraffe: Talking bout dark zone😄
[2022-06-17T01:46:35] rosheee: u do fast bleed or normal?
[2022-06-17T01:46:39] Unknown: Pads are literally riding on the rotors, so little tolerance
[2022-06-17T01:46:42] rosheee: lol?
[2022-06-17T01:47:03] Unknown: I do normal... Then fast. Always keep pushing pistons back to fully inwards position
[2022-06-17T01:47:05] rosheee: ah btw have u set the levers to max outside'
[2022-06-17T01:47:20] rosheee: but u use the original magura blockers?
[2022-06-17T01:47:30] Unknown: 🧐... No I haven't. Reach point adjustment?
[2022-06-17T01:47:48] rosheee: put them max out
[2022-06-17T01:47:55] rosheee: then redo bleed1ng
[2022-06-17T01:48:06] rosheee: and redo adjustment of caliper
[2022-06-17T01:48:10] Unknown: Well yea, they do have some play that let's the pistons travel a bit. I take them out push the pistons back in by hand a few times during the bleed and before I cap the lever
[2022-06-17T01:48:20] Unknown: Furthest away from bars?
[2022-06-17T01:48:30] rosheee: yes
[2022-06-17T01:48:34] rosheee: take pads out
[2022-06-17T01:48:43] rosheee: mount screw again and put in the magura blockers
[2022-06-17T01:48:43] Unknown: Hmm. I will definitely try that tonight. Thanks for the tip
[2022-06-17T01:48:44] rosheee: then bleed the shit
[2022-06-17T01:48:53] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_4970@17-06-2022_01-48-53.jpg>
[2022-06-17T01:48:59] Unknown: Awesome. I didn't think about the reach adjustment while bleeding
[2022-06-17T01:49:06] Unknown: That just may help 👍👍
[2022-06-17T01:49:40] rosheee: to get 0 air inside when u take out the syringe from the caliper put the caliper higher than the lever then put screw in and go down with the caliper to the ground slowly until oil comes out then go on with going down and tighten the bleedport screw
[2022-06-17T01:49:51] rosheee: then no air same u do with the lever
[2022-06-17T01:49:59] Unknown: As you can hear... Rotors are rubbing a bit
[2022-06-17T01:50:02] rosheee: then u have fuckeria
[2022-06-17T01:50:30] rosheee: how many km u rode?
[2022-06-17T01:50:33] Unknown: 🥺
[2022-06-17T01:50:45] rosheee: and have u proper done the braking XD?
[2022-06-17T01:50:53] Unknown: Only about 30 Miles ... 50km..?
[2022-06-17T01:51:03] rosheee: going from 30-40 to 0 without letting lever go
[2022-06-17T01:51:08] rosheee: that they are straight
[2022-06-17T01:51:09] Unknown: Yup broke pads in perfectly
[2022-06-17T01:51:18] Unknown: They grab like a bastard
[2022-06-17T01:51:21] rosheee: xD
[2022-06-17T01:51:23] Unknown: No glazing
[2022-06-17T01:51:45] rosheee: BUT do that with the caliper from high to low
[2022-06-17T01:51:48] Unknown: I re-bleed tonight and let you know. Will try with reach adjust out
[2022-06-17T01:52:32] Unknown: Unfortunately my brake line runs thru my deck side panel so unless I physically turn the scooter upside down, maybe tricky.... Maybe lay on its side and try that
[2022-06-17T01:52:43] rosheee: mine as well
[2022-06-17T01:52:47] rosheee: take of the lever
[2022-06-17T01:52:51] rosheee: and fold the scooter
[2022-06-17T01:52:55] Unknown: Smart
[2022-06-17T01:52:57] Unknown: Ahh
[2022-06-17T01:53:00] Unknown: So smart
[2022-06-17T01:53:02] rosheee: it RLY makes a difference
[2022-06-17T01:53:07] rosheee: and if u still think there is air inside
[2022-06-17T01:53:14] Unknown: I will try that... Didn't think of doing that
[2022-06-17T01:53:32] Unknown: I don't think I have air... Just super tight tolerance between pads and rotors
[2022-06-17T01:53:33] rosheee: u should have like 5mm of way until max brake power after u've remove the syringe from caliper
[2022-06-17T01:53:36] rosheee: when u do it that way
[2022-06-17T01:53:51] Unknown: Cool. Will try that 👍
[2022-06-17T01:54:25] Unknown: Front and rear are the same tight fit. Seems the same on both regardless of air vs no air
[2022-06-17T01:54:32] rosheee: and if u still think there is air inside the lever -> turn it around and bleed the other port
[2022-06-17T01:54:48] Unknown: I try re-bleed and take a video 👍
[2022-06-17T01:55:18] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-06-17T01:55:24] rosheee: With 30% remaining on pads
[2022-06-17T01:58:10] Mirko Boni: <video_file>
[2022-06-17T01:58:21] Unknown: <video_file>
[2022-06-17T01:59:49] Unknown: I mean.. not rubbing bad at all... Just slightly. Maybe pads just need to be riden more. Levers are firm as hell, doubtful any air. I bled them really good
[2022-06-17T02:01:52] Mirko Boni: Perfect!
[2022-06-17T02:02:40] Unknown: Still a tiny bit of rubbing. I think is close as it might get til pads and rotors wear down a bit
[2022-06-17T02:03:36] Mirko Boni: It's a light rub!
[2022-06-17T02:03:40] Unknown: With Maguras I actually never use my variable Regen lever at all. 100% mechanical brakes always. No need for variable e-brake honestly. It's there if I need it but literally haven't used it all at lately
[2022-06-17T02:03:42] Happy Giraffe: If rub doesn't slow wheel on air it's ok
[2022-06-17T02:04:13] Unknown: Eensy weensy rub. More annoying than anything lok
[2022-06-17T02:05:06] Mirko Boni: In my G30 it rubs, but you can't feel it at speed!
[2022-06-17T02:05:22] Unknown: Yup, it doesn't seem to be affecting the rolling resistance much. Little bit on the front tho. Front used to spin longer than rear on the bench now rear spins a tiny bit longer. So I think I'm getting a little tiny bit of rub on the front
[2022-06-17T02:05:44] Happy Giraffe: Also you can try the disc if it gets warm from it
[2022-06-17T02:06:13] rosheee: but they shouldn't
[2022-06-17T02:06:15] rosheee: ^^
[2022-06-17T02:06:43] Unknown: Even brand new Magura rotors have a tiny bit of unevenness to them... I think that's where the rubbing is coming from. Very hesitant to start bending them tho 😬
[2022-06-17T02:06:45] Happy Giraffe: Light rub should go away, clean disc
[2022-06-17T02:07:31] Unknown: I don't want to say wobble... But there is a slight wobble. Maybe it's how the wheel is mounted..? Maybe try remounting the wheel into the swingarms? Could be off center possibly?
[2022-06-17T02:08:04] Happy Giraffe: Or maybe pads are not center with rotor
[2022-06-17T02:08:06] Unknown: I've read on MTB forums the wheel mounting can be ever so slightly off center and cause the rotor to look wobbly
[2022-06-17T02:08:26] Happy Giraffe: Hard to see on video, light or white paper behing and carefully adjust
[2022-06-17T02:08:29] Unknown: Hmm.. how do you center your caliper on rotor?
[2022-06-17T02:08:50] Unknown: Do you hold the lever pressed first while caliper is still loose?
[2022-06-17T02:09:01] Happy Giraffe: I dont press lever at all
[2022-06-17T02:09:06] Unknown: I've tried a few different caliper centering methods
[2022-06-17T02:09:09] Unknown: Me either...
[2022-06-17T02:09:28] Unknown: Holding the lever to center the caliper always is shit for me
[2022-06-17T02:09:29] Happy Giraffe: By eye only, carefully looking where pistons go and where is small or big gap
[2022-06-17T02:09:40] Unknown: Yup, ok.. same here man
[2022-06-17T02:09:52] Unknown: With pistons fully retracted of course
[2022-06-17T02:10:12] Happy Giraffe: Should be good, then for final tightening you might want to keep a finger to resist caliper twisting
[2022-06-17T02:10:17] Happy Giraffe: Then you keep same position
[2022-06-17T02:10:19] Unknown: Do you have that little tolerance between your Kool stops and storm rotors Happy?
[2022-06-17T02:10:35] Happy Giraffe: I had small tolerance but no rub
[2022-06-17T02:10:44] Unknown: Oh ok 👍
[2022-06-17T02:11:20] Unknown: My Nutt brakes had a lot of clearance lol. But Maguras very little clearance however levers have very good bite point
[2022-06-17T02:11:21] rosheee: i just pull lever max then tighten
[2022-06-17T02:11:29] Unknown: That has never ever worked for. Me
[2022-06-17T02:11:50] Unknown: I tighten the calipers, let go of the lever and caliper is dead rubbing on one side bad
[2022-06-17T02:12:09] Unknown: Magura suggests that way... I just never had luck with it
[2022-06-17T02:12:23] Happy Giraffe: Mount could be bent/warped aswell
[2022-06-17T02:12:30] Happy Giraffe: Need to watch from all angles
[2022-06-17T02:12:34] Unknown: Brandy new mounts brother
[2022-06-17T02:12:48] Happy Giraffe: Yea but still, even scooter body
[2022-06-17T02:12:55] Unknown: Hmm true
[2022-06-17T02:13:30] Happy Giraffe: Just need to look carefully with good light
[2022-06-17T02:13:55] Happy Giraffe: Gn, I have to ship 10x 20kg packages tomorrow😂
[2022-06-17T02:14:15] Happy Giraffe: So many scooter stuff and tools...
[2022-06-17T02:32:21] Unknown: Nite man 👍

[2022-06-17T03:33:03] Unknown: 6F is tiny. 12F medium and 24F is compact for it's power.
[2022-06-17T03:33:19] Unknown: Way smaller than sabvoton or kelly of equal power
[2022-06-17T03:33:19] rosheee: Ah lol xD
[2022-06-17T03:33:35] rosheee: Holycrap

[2022-06-17T03:33:53] rosheee: X2
[2022-06-17T03:33:58] Unknown: Just need to charge and ride while logging all parameters. Then you believe
[2022-06-17T03:34:07] rosheee: Yes
[2022-06-17T03:34:10] rosheee: Then send file
[2022-06-17T03:34:19] rosheee: Cuz i cant find 0 logs
[2022-06-17T03:34:21] Unknown: With potting. The potting compound makes them heavy
[2022-06-17T03:34:55] Unknown: I will. Nobody shares logs bc most Nuc guys have no reason to 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-06-17T03:35:06] rosheee: XD i wanna see
[2022-06-17T03:35:08] rosheee: How it acts

[2022-06-17T03:43:34] Unknown: Getting better. Shoulder is still really sore. Knee and wrist are much better. I just took a short 5 mile ride and felt ok. Still can't lift my arm too high tho, shoulder will take a while to heal fully
[2022-06-17T03:44:17] Unknown: I tried logging that ride but didn't do it right 🙈. Came back home and figured out my mistake.. then sent screenshot showing my success on the bench haha

[2022-06-17T04:57:45] rosheee: let's fucking do this
[2022-06-17T07:07:07] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-06-17T09:17:10] Konstantin: Price? You from Germany? My mother in law live in Germany
[2022-06-17T09:45:06] Mirono escooters: Oempf price
[2022-06-17T10:28:26] francois schempers: the 20kW version are interesting, maybe those instead of kelly, but kelly can do 700A peak, I Wonder what those can do, tell me how they handle when you have them ;)
[2022-06-17T10:52:17] Artem Bulashev: A bit better than 48x and thus better than 50g
[2022-06-17T10:52:25] Artem Bulashev: At 5/10/15amps
[2022-06-17T10:54:25] Artem Bulashev: No
[2022-06-17T10:55:05] Artem Bulashev: That is PEI coated layer on it to increase adhesion. It is made special for hard to stick filaments like ABS and PC
[2022-06-17T10:55:19] Artem Bulashev: PETG is THE STICKIEST of all materials
[2022-06-17T10:57:45] Artem Bulashev: That is why it is often printed 0.1mm higher - to reduce adhesion, or printed on surface that doesn’t stick as much - glass, metal, non smooth PEI COATED SHEET, FR4 and others Smooth PEI is about THE STICKIEST surface you can find and you just can not print the stickiest filament on it (PETG) because they will fuse and come of together with PEI layer
[2022-06-17T10:59:36] Artem Bulashev: Def user error so no warranty case Glue stick is used to control stickiness - it helps to adhere and helps to separate, but I prefer not to use such solution. Just found good surface for PETG and another bed for abs and another for pla
[2022-06-17T11:16:03] Mirko Boni: Hello everyone dear friends! Good Friday!
[2022-06-17T11:16:50] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_4977@17-06-2022_11-16-50.jpg>
[2022-06-17T11:17:22] Mirko Boni: To build this battery, do you have to remove the track?
[2022-06-17T11:18:22] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_4978@17-06-2022_11-18-22.jpg>
[2022-06-17T11:21:10] Paolo ⁭: jes
[2022-06-17T11:33:08] D J: Does anyone know a good potting compound to fill a controller?
[2022-06-17T11:34:57] Mirono escooters: Resin is liquid and will fill everything. But its not a silicon, it gets hard
[2022-06-17T11:35:55] Mirono escooters: I only use glass, haha, when cooled print pops off. When hot, its inseperatable
[2022-06-17T11:39:49] D J: what do you think is best to fill the controller and make it waterproof?
[2022-06-17T11:40:11] Mirono escooters: Resin, for personal use
[2022-06-17T11:40:58] Mirko Boni: Grazie Paolo!
[2022-06-17T11:50:01] D J: This one will be good?
[2022-06-17T11:52:53] Mirono escooters: Yea even better therm1l conductivity
[2022-06-17T11:56:40] D J: Thanks 👌I'll try it 😁
[2022-06-17T12:06:06] Happy Giraffe: Thanks! That's cool
[2022-06-17T12:06:19] Mirko Boni: To calculate the length of the battery, I need to know if the rail needs to be removed! So can I decrease the length?
[2022-06-17T12:17:25] sombre_enfant: You need to remove them totally no need to calculate
[2022-06-17T12:21:26] Mirko Boni: Ok thank you
[2022-06-17T12:26:20] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_4980@17-06-2022_12-26-20.jpg>
[2022-06-17T12:26:20] sombre_enfant: @PaoloWu normal for longyu ?
[2022-06-17T12:29:53] sombre_enfant: Also what do that mean ? I mesured 1 copper strand is 0.6mm
[2022-06-17T12:37:22] Paolo ⁭: this is high torque version i think
[2022-06-17T12:38:14] sombre_enfant: Bruh rly so what speed i can reach on like 16s?
[2022-06-17T12:44:55] Happy Giraffe: You get nice torque then from 120 phase👍
[2022-06-17T12:45:10] Mirono escooters: Yea i prefer high torque motors
[2022-06-17T12:45:19] Mirono escooters: Torque > speed
[2022-06-17T12:45:36] Mirono escooters: Rather zoom off then having to accel 30 sec :p
[2022-06-17T12:47:21] sombre_enfant: Nah
[2022-06-17T12:48:34] Mirono escooters: Personal choice
[2022-06-17T12:48:40] Mirono escooters: Donate to me😘
[2022-06-17T12:49:30] sombre_enfant: 200€
[2022-06-17T12:50:07] Mirono escooters: :(
[2022-06-17T13:15:10] sombre_enfant: Idrc about torque i just need to reach atleast 80kph
[2022-06-17T13:15:46] Mirono escooters: U wanna die?
[2022-06-17T13:16:34] sombre_enfant: Yeah life dont hit as much than when i was 5
[2022-06-17T13:17:03] Mirono escooters: Fair
[2022-06-17T13:20:19] sombre_enfant: Bruh
[2022-06-17T13:55:07] Paolo ⁭: Fuck France
[2022-06-17T13:55:11] Paolo ⁭: So Monday 😭
[2022-06-17T13:56:21] Mirono escooters: F
[2022-06-17T14:39:42] Happy Giraffe: Oui
[2022-06-17T14:42:15] Mirono escooters: Oui oui baguette
[2022-06-17T15:00:44] Happy Giraffe: You can get same torque from high kv but problem is getting high amps on budget
[2022-06-17T15:01:09] Happy Giraffe: And if you wont use near topspeed its bit pointless for motor efficiency aswell
[2022-06-17T15:01:50] Happy Giraffe: DD hub drive always related to wheel speed
[2022-06-17T15:01:54] Mirono escooters: And space
[2022-06-17T15:02:02] Happy Giraffe: Yep
[2022-06-17T15:02:19] Mirono escooters: Especially for my obsession with xiaomi.. :)
[2022-06-17T15:02:37] Mirono escooters: I dont drive 65kmh in city 😂
[2022-06-17T15:02:43] Happy Giraffe: I will mostly spend my time on 60-70 max speed on ebike so torque is good for bit longer
[2022-06-17T15:02:51] Mirono escooters: Too much children run between cars or nutnuts open car doors
[2022-06-17T15:02:55] Happy Giraffe: Yep, 60 max for me
[2022-06-17T15:03:03] Mirono escooters: I always ride as far as possible from car doors.
[2022-06-17T15:03:10] Mirono escooters: City. I wish. Approx 35
[2022-06-17T15:03:12] Happy Giraffe: Yes in worst places its 15-20 lol
[2022-06-17T15:03:24] Mirono escooters: With dual magura i trust it more But still my reflexes suck
[2022-06-17T15:03:28] Happy Giraffe: Here some good straight roads
[2022-06-17T15:03:46] Mirono escooters: On the normal road i overtake cars at 65, its funny, lol
[2022-06-17T15:04:05] Mirono escooters: Or stuck behind cars. Normally other way around
[2022-06-17T15:06:09] Happy Giraffe: Having bit higher voltage on batt and geated 10T motor will be nice🌚
[2022-06-17T15:07:38] Mirono escooters: Still not convinced of geared
[2022-06-17T15:07:49] Mirono escooters: I need to fix a ebike for friend think its geared ill trst it
[2022-06-17T15:09:12] Happy Giraffe: Most geared motors are shite but this is a bigger one
[2022-06-17T15:09:26] Happy Giraffe: Very low amps for 90Nm torque
[2022-06-17T15:12:12] Mirono escooters: Well its problably nothing for me
[2022-06-17T15:12:24] Mirono escooters: You build a semi legal ebike with sensor and shite
[2022-06-17T15:12:37] Mirono escooters: I go full bukake with 3600w and throttle and shit
[2022-06-17T15:45:29] Oliver Eliasson: What size?
[2022-06-17T16:02:31] Artem Bulashev: Thermal conductive part and reuse the temperature of the ubox by about 30%
[2022-06-17T16:03:22] Artem Bulashev: That is because most fats are cooled down by PCB, but PCB is not cool down by anything originally. Potting allows PCB to cool down to the case
[2022-06-17T16:03:40] Mirono escooters: Does it conduct (good)?
[2022-06-17T16:03:52] Mirono escooters: I would think such epoxy doesnt conduct after some mm/cm
[2022-06-17T16:06:52] Paolo ⁭: Anyway pcb too not cool much, because the material is vetronite. They should do aluminium pcb but no available for double layer assembly
[2022-06-17T16:07:34] Mirono escooters: And Chinese dont like expensive stuff :)
[2022-06-17T16:43:11] sombre_enfant: <video_file>
[2022-06-17T16:47:00] Mirono escooters: Noice
[2022-06-17T16:47:47] Happy Giraffe: Would be sleeper if stock handlebar
[2022-06-17T16:48:03] Mirono escooters: Eh best upgrade imo
[2022-06-17T16:48:14] Mirono escooters: Stock handlebar ieuw i cant get used to it once i tried diff
[2022-06-17T16:48:15] Happy Giraffe: Bur mudguard and monorim gives it away already
[2022-06-17T16:48:25] Happy Giraffe: Xiaomi stock one pure love
[2022-06-17T16:48:30] Mirono escooters: Suspension is still sleeper kinda, thats just for comfort
[2022-06-17T16:48:40] Mirono escooters: So small and ti.y control
[2022-06-17T16:55:32] Artem Bulashev: As I said temp drop 30% on ubox
[2022-06-17T16:56:03] Artem Bulashev: With aluminum pcb would be more, but not that many people who need that
[2022-06-17T16:56:13] Mirono escooters: But if u kill component or need to be inside, f
[2022-06-17T17:03:43] Artem Bulashev: Some of the dissolve in 99 alcohol
[2022-06-17T17:05:02] Mirono escooters: Aha
[2022-06-17T17:05:43] rosheee: No
[2022-06-17T17:08:13] Mirko Boni: Why not? What do you mean by your no?
[2022-06-17T17:56:15] sombre_enfant: @roscheeee hey my brother in christ is it the right way to put the adapter, last time i did it was wrong
[2022-06-17T18:12:28] Oliver Eliasson: Thinking of making ninebot sleeper. Only rear motor but maybe switch to vsett motor. Is suspension necessary or does upgrading to pmt tires help enough?
[2022-06-17T18:13:03] Oliver Eliasson: City riding and max around 40km/h
[2022-06-17T18:13:41] Mirono escooters: Never necessarily, just nice But for a sleeper i wouldnt
[2022-06-17T18:13:45] sombre_enfant: For 40kph no need to change anything just put a 13s
[2022-06-17T18:13:47] Mirono escooters: Especially at that speed
[2022-06-17T18:14:46] Oliver Eliasson: I want crazy torque though
[2022-06-17T18:15:03] Oliver Eliasson: Maybe get low kv motor
[2022-06-17T18:15:06] Mirono escooters: Gen6 has good torque
[2022-06-17T18:15:14] rosheee: Deoends
[2022-06-17T18:15:22] Paolo ⁭: Put low Kv motor
[2022-06-17T18:15:26] rosheee: I have to choose ur side
[2022-06-17T18:15:33] Mirono escooters: Or get a flj motor like me (or any low kv) high torque motor 😀
[2022-06-17T18:15:49] Paolo ⁭: Ive a 50mm motor and 35kmh max at 16s😂
[2022-06-17T18:16:04] Paolo ⁭: But is powerful like double motor xd
[2022-06-17T18:16:07] Oliver Eliasson: Yeah something like that
[2022-06-17T18:16:22] Paolo ⁭: Otherwise version 40mm and made 23kmh at 36v fully charged
[2022-06-17T18:16:28] Mirono escooters: Wow haha
[2022-06-17T18:21:14] sombre_enfant: Do you have pic of yours ?
[2022-06-17T18:21:18] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-06-17T18:56:38] Luis Magalhaes: any one knows where are the PMT stradale Radial at best price in europe ?
[2022-06-17T18:57:04] Luis Magalhaes: @PaoloWu this is italian product whats the price over there ?
[2022-06-17T18:59:33] Paolo ⁭: 53 the 90 version and 58 100 version
[2022-06-17T19:00:41] Luis Magalhaes: 👍 ok tks mate, i was seeing now at fast ride they have a discount on the 90 to 48€
[2022-06-17T19:01:17] Luis Magalhaes: let me see how much for the transport 😅
[2022-06-17T19:02:48] Luis Magalhaes: 19€ shipping
[2022-06-17T19:03:02] Luis Magalhaes: so 2 total 114€
[2022-06-17T19:05:25] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb its good price mate?
[2022-06-17T19:06:48] Luis Magalhaes: @PaoloWu does the pmt afect the range on scooters? because of the better rubber ?
[2022-06-17T19:07:53] rosheee: It is ebtrer
[2022-06-17T19:07:55] rosheee: It is fuckeria
[2022-06-17T19:07:58] rosheee: It is more geip
[2022-06-17T19:08:05] rosheee: Deoends on your pressurw
[2022-06-17T19:08:13] rosheee: But i feel like in gt3 with pmt
[2022-06-17T19:08:25] rosheee: Pmt only
[2022-06-17T19:08:25] Luis Magalhaes: dam..
[2022-06-17T19:08:32] rosheee: In wet it makes u wet
[2022-06-17T19:08:35] Luis Magalhaes: have to try them 💪
[2022-06-17T19:08:36] rosheee: Order from paolo
[2022-06-17T19:08:43] rosheee: He has best price n shit
[2022-06-17T19:09:18] Luis Magalhaes: will pm him 😜
[2022-06-17T19:10:21] rosheee: So now my bearings arrived

[2022-06-17T19:10:48] Paolo ⁭: stradale is no soft
[2022-06-17T19:10:54] Paolo ⁭: i dont like it
[2022-06-17T19:11:25] Paolo ⁭: if is need for road at least you should install junior
[2022-06-17T19:12:13] Luis Magalhaes: its for daily use so if not the softer one should be fine for not loosing too much range too
[2022-06-17T19:12:29] Paolo ⁭: junior is not too soft
[2022-06-17T19:15:23] Luis Magalhaes: whats the price for the junior ?
[2022-06-17T19:15:48] Luis Magalhaes: and junior are softer rubber then stradalle is that?
[2022-06-17T19:16:26] Unknown: 2Z huh? That's metal shield not rubber seals
[2022-06-17T19:16:34] rosheee: yes
[2022-06-17T19:16:50] rosheee: why i need 3 sealed xD?
[2022-06-17T19:16:57] Unknown: Should be ok in sealed motor. Super low rolling resistance. Top speed increase by 70kmh lol
[2022-06-17T19:17:06] rosheee: Trippel sealeed?
[2022-06-17T19:17:20] rosheee: the 3c is important
[2022-06-17T19:17:23] rosheee: sry
[2022-06-17T19:17:24] rosheee: C3
[2022-06-17T19:17:26] Unknown: Nahh. I would recommend 2rs double shield but metal shield ok
[2022-06-17T19:17:37] rosheee: i talked to skf ^^'
[2022-06-17T19:17:40] rosheee: they said this
[2022-06-17T19:17:51] rosheee: perfect for racing
[2022-06-17T19:18:06] rosheee: have u checked what the C3 means?
[2022-06-17T19:20:57] rosheee: Holycrap
[2022-06-17T19:21:04] rosheee: XD print is 100% fit
[2022-06-17T19:21:48] rosheee: Made spacer for kaabo box
[2022-06-17T19:21:55] rosheee: With airflow outlet xD
[2022-06-17T19:22:12] rosheee: The C3 adam xD it isnt only shield
[2022-06-17T19:22:41] D J: Show 😀?
[2022-06-17T19:22:51] rosheee: First insidw
[2022-06-17T19:23:06] rosheee: Have to redesign the part for tronic
[2022-06-17T19:23:09] D J: Show 😁
[2022-06-17T19:23:27] D J: I need too
[2022-06-17T19:23:36] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-06-17T19:23:39] rosheee: Can give u files then
[2022-06-17T19:23:50] rosheee: Can design for ublx as well with holding for fans
[2022-06-17T19:24:26] rosheee: Outside
[2022-06-17T19:24:29] rosheee: But this v1

[2022-06-17T19:49:03] rosheee: C3 is inside he told me
[2022-06-17T19:49:07] rosheee: The gap is more
[2022-06-17T19:51:48] rosheee: Why are your bearings C3? - Bearing King https://www.bearing-king.co.uk/article/why-are-your-bearings-c3
[2022-06-17T19:51:48] rosheee: Internal clearance being C3 means that the bearing has room for expansion if needed between the races of the bearing, whilst holding the outer ring and moving the inner ring in a radial movement you will detect a little amount of play between the two rings. All standard clearance bearings have this movement, it may only be a small amount of movement but is controlled by international standards. C3 means the bearing has more clearance than standard. For example we may use C3 clearance on bearings where a cold start up application my cause the balls to heat up quickly, the heat needs to go somewhere. Some of the heat gets passed through the outer race to the housing and the inner race to the shaft, this causes expansion which closes up the clearance in the bearing. If you did not allow for this clearance the bearing would not have room for expansion and lead to bearing failure.
[2022-06-17T20:01:25] Unknown: Ahh... Interesting. So it's between the inner and outer races to allow expansion of the ball bearings themselves. I always thought it was the OD bearing race to the housing. Is it not that as well?
[2022-06-17T20:07:29] rosheee: ?
[2022-06-17T20:07:30] rosheee: OD?
[2022-06-17T20:14:17] Happy Giraffe: Outer Diameter (of your mom)
[2022-06-17T20:14:22] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>

[2022-06-17T21:41:09] Bumble: I just put 3ml ferrofluid and while the stator is at 80c, the motor shell is 30c for about 10 minutes of riding
[2022-06-17T21:41:37] Bumble: You think 3ml is too little for a small 10 inch scooter?
[2022-06-17T21:41:57] rosheee: i used 2 much
[2022-06-17T21:42:28] Bumble: How much?
[2022-06-17T21:42:29] rosheee: depends on motor
[2022-06-17T21:44:21] Bumble: If the outer shell is 30-40c colder for such a long time, I'm not sure it's efficient enough
[2022-06-17T21:44:37] rosheee: what was it before lol
[2022-06-17T21:44:39] Unknown: I put 6.5ml in my Vsett motors. My rear leaked a little bit because I forgot to seal the motor covers the last time I opened it so I added more lol. I don't think I lost nearly as much as I added... So may have 7-8ml in the rear now. Does have a little bit more rolling resistance than the front but that could just be how the bearings and/or covers seated
[2022-06-17T21:44:57] Unknown: 3ml isn't enough to fill the air gap usually
[2022-06-17T21:45:08] Unknown: So your benefits will be reduced by a lot
[2022-06-17T21:45:21] rosheee: idk how much i used but 10ml for vsett is 2 much
[2022-06-17T21:45:26] Unknown: I would use at least 5ml. 6ml is still safe
[2022-06-17T21:45:27] rosheee: 5-7ml maybe
[2022-06-17T21:45:37] rosheee: if 2 much u see it @ mosfet temps
[2022-06-17T21:45:42] rosheee: and less torque
[2022-06-17T21:45:44] Unknown: Yea 10ml per motor is way much. 5-7 is perfect
[2022-06-17T21:46:46] Unknown: I think 5ml was for a smaller ebike motor, which isn't much larger than ours. We have 50mm magnets and .5mm air gap, so there is more room for ferrofluid than you might think
[2022-06-17T21:47:18] Unknown: Also those ebike motors recommended 5ml may have 35 or 40mm magnets
[2022-06-17T22:43:26] Happy Giraffe: Motor case will always be like that, it's far from windings etc so it's air in between
[2022-06-17T22:45:19] Mirono escooters: Bettrt abit too much then too less
[2022-06-17T22:45:42] Mirono escooters: Ff can leak?
[2022-06-17T23:19:31] Happy Giraffe: Ofcourse you didnt seal your motor?😂🌚
[2022-06-17T23:19:33] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-06-17T23:19:48] Mirono escooters: I did
[2022-06-17T23:19:51] Mirono escooters: Silicon go brr
[2022-06-17T23:19:52] Happy Giraffe: Then all good
[2022-06-17T23:19:56] Mirono escooters: Ok nice
[2022-06-17T23:20:19] Mirono escooters: There was rust on the cover plate inside, just barely away from insides. Not letting that happen
[2022-06-17T23:20:29] Mirono escooters: Always open sexond hand motors, or old ones
[2022-06-17T23:21:06] Happy Giraffe: I sealed the motor I sold you, should be still as new
[2022-06-17T23:21:32] Happy Giraffe: That would be ultimate test of sealing
[2022-06-17T23:21:45] Mirono escooters: Open second hand motors from random sellers
[2022-06-17T23:21:48] Mirono escooters: I trust happy 😘
[2022-06-17T23:22:05] Mirono escooters: The disk is unharmed, how, i dont know, if i saw how it was ins8de 😂😂
[2022-06-17T23:23:37] Happy Giraffe: Thats called pressure against the box😂
[2022-06-17T23:24:58] Mirono escooters: Ups has been good
[2022-06-17T23:33:26] Unknown: Guys, any feedback on the Logan brakes that come on NAMI? A buddy is buying one and wants to go Magura but he said he's heard the Logan's are close to Magura dual pistons. I told him I don't know for sure, but don't think they are lol
[2022-06-17T23:33:50] Mirono escooters: Logans are pretty good, more direct brake power then maguras
[2022-06-17T23:34:00] Mirono escooters: Its a preference, but i wouldn't waste money on maguras *if u have logans already*
[2022-06-17T23:34:18] Unknown: Oh okay. Interesting. Good to know 👍
[2022-06-17T23:34:37] Mirono escooters: Apart from preference their power is the same
[2022-06-17T23:36:31] Unknown: Cool man. Thanks for the info 🥂
[2022-06-17T23:37:28] sombre_enfant: Piston look smaller on logan
[2022-06-17T23:39:41] Paolo ⁭: @SibClimb the spring that numo use in their new scooter is same like monorim lol
[2022-06-17T23:39:53] Mirono escooters: Quality.
[2022-06-17T23:40:01] Paolo ⁭: Coil like kaabo or wolf
[2022-06-17T23:40:15] Paolo ⁭: Anyway better than rion no suspension xd
[2022-06-17T23:41:19] Mirono escooters: Rion 🤡💀
[2022-06-17T23:43:12] Happy Giraffe: Rion 140mm discs without regen and some magura basic stuff😅
[2022-06-17T23:43:18] Happy Giraffe: Now they upgraded a bit lol
[2022-06-17T23:43:23] Mirono escooters: Finally
[2022-06-17T23:43:45] Happy Giraffe: Their design team has no experience from bicycles or motos
[2022-06-17T23:43:52] Mirono escooters: I mean, small brand, designed emself, i do respect em for listening but, some things are pretty obvious
[2022-06-17T23:43:53] Paolo ⁭: Price increased a lot
[2022-06-17T23:44:14] Mirono escooters: Dem disks must be HOT
[2022-06-17T23:44:16] Paolo ⁭: Magura is designed for 45kmh with 203mm disc lol
[2022-06-17T23:44:26] Paolo ⁭: And they use 140mm disc xd
[2022-06-17T23:44:29] Mirono escooters: My ebike 60 to 0, damn, didnt know it gets that hot
[2022-06-17T23:44:29] Happy Giraffe: Yes, people had brakes failing
[2022-06-17T23:44:39] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse
[2022-06-17T23:44:54] Happy Giraffe: Smaller disc is also harder to stop, less leverage for the pad
[2022-06-17T23:44:55] Mirono escooters: Good luck downhill
[2022-06-17T23:45:03] Happy Giraffe: Less material, less leverage
[2022-06-17T23:45:09] Happy Giraffe: Faster spinning🌚 gg
[2022-06-17T23:45:10] Mirono escooters: Less centrifugal force
[2022-06-17T23:45:30] Mirono escooters: And their battery is also.. special
[2022-06-17T23:45:35] Happy Giraffe: Its not centrifugal but just raw lack of torque to resist the force
[2022-06-17T23:45:50] Happy Giraffe: Just like a long wrench
[2022-06-17T23:45:59] Mirono escooters: O yes like dat. I get it
[2022-06-17T23:46:19] Happy Giraffe: Try to grab a fast spinning wrench thats 5cm long, Rion design gg
[2022-06-17T23:46:23] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-06-17T23:46:32] Mirono escooters: My brain still doesnt understand how such a tiny brake stops a heavy ebike/scooter. All that energy just into some heat, wow
[2022-06-17T23:47:00] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, some brake pads have copper baseplate so cools pad little bettwe
[2022-06-17T23:47:13] Mirono escooters: Yep and saw 1 model with tiny heatsink lol, was cute
[2022-06-17T23:47:29] Mirono escooters: Still disk heats up alot, but those magura w extra heatsink were cute
[2022-06-17T23:47:34] Mirono escooters: Price less cute
[2022-06-17T23:47:37] Happy Giraffe: I will test the 203 and 45
[2022-06-17T23:47:56] Mirono escooters: Long downhill im ebrake man, everything else mechanical
[2022-06-17T23:48:04] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, scooter tire size is a problem. If even 12" wheel then 203 could be used
[2022-06-17T23:49:10] Mirono escooters: Yep ebrake plenty more height
[2022-06-17T23:49:18] Mirono escooters: Try cornering even with 180 lol on scoot
[2022-06-18T00:22:50] Mirko Boni: Good evening everyone!
[2022-06-18T00:23:05] Mirono escooters: Hy!
[2022-06-18T00:23:58] Mirko Boni: A curiosity, how do the vsett 10 motors behave with 60A of battery current? Do they heat up so much?
[2022-06-18T00:24:12] Mirko Boni: 👋 Ciao
[2022-06-18T00:25:07] Mirono escooters: 60a dual or single? How many phase
[2022-06-18T00:26:19] Mirko Boni: 60A to each motor
[2022-06-18T00:27:06] Mirko Boni: I don't know how many Amps for each phase! What do you recommend?

[2022-06-18T01:12:19] Mirko Boni: Woow
[2022-06-18T01:12:32] Unknown: On speed 3 settings and 6-7ml of ferrofluid my motors have never gone above 185F at the windings (not the covers) on a pretty warm day
[2022-06-18T01:12:37] rosheee: Then show dem file
[2022-06-18T01:12:37] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-06-18T01:12:52] Mirko Boni: But do you use ferrofluid?

[2022-06-18T02:02:33] Mirko Boni: With this ubox the throttle must be 5v or 3.3 volts?
[2022-06-18T02:02:43] rosheee: depends on ur throttle
[2022-06-18T02:02:44] Mirko Boni: https://spintend.com/products/75v-200a-dual-motor-controller-ubox-based-on-vesc
[2022-06-18T02:02:49] rosheee: u can choose 5v or 3.3v with acc adapter
[2022-06-18T02:03:29] Mirko Boni: So should I buy adapter?
[2022-06-18T02:03:42] rosheee: i bought it with adapter
[2022-06-18T02:03:44] rosheee: cuz filter
[2022-06-18T02:04:22] Mirko Boni: Kindly, do you have an aliexpress link?
[2022-06-18T02:04:30] rosheee: no
[2022-06-18T02:04:32] rosheee: don't buy there
[2022-06-18T02:04:32] rosheee: lol
[2022-06-18T02:04:36] rosheee: buy from spintend
[2022-06-18T02:04:39] rosheee: directly
[2022-06-18T02:04:41] rosheee: also cuzt warranty

[2022-06-18T02:11:16] rosheee: ?
[2022-06-18T02:11:21] Unknown: Oh I can go up to around 1300w on 120v USA grid power (wall outlet). Power supply can also be powered by 220v for full 2000w output. 1300. On 120v wall plug power I can charge up to around 15a. 1300w / 84v full charge = 15.4a
[2022-06-18T02:11:24] rosheee: I hav never tried
[2022-06-18T02:11:38] rosheee: Ok
[2022-06-18T02:11:56] rosheee: Just not that portable xD
[2022-06-18T02:11:59] rosheee: I use 8A for 20S
[2022-06-18T02:12:39] Mirko Boni: Throttle voltage
[2022-06-18T02:12:53] Mirko Boni: Throttle voltage
[2022-06-18T02:13:00] Unknown: Cool thing is with charge thru controller, you can use any power supply lower than the battery voltage. I can use another 18s or less scooter battery to charge from, EV power station, 12v car lighter, any power supply less than the battery voltage can be used to charge the battery
[2022-06-18T02:13:37] rosheee: Thats nice
[2022-06-18T02:13:40] Unknown: I just set my charge rate... 0a-15a. I usually just slow charge because I'm a battery freak lol
[2022-06-18T02:14:00] rosheee: I used 5A all time..
[2022-06-18T02:14:14] rosheee: Molicel handle 8A easy xD
[2022-06-18T02:14:47] Unknown: If I slow charge overnight I usually set to 3a or so which is like .008c Cells will last forever ♾️
[2022-06-18T02:15:01] Paolo ⁭: If cooled correctly yes
[2022-06-18T02:15:25] rosheee: what cooled?
[2022-06-18T02:15:43] Paolo ⁭: Cell
[2022-06-18T02:15:48] rosheee: XD
[2022-06-18T02:16:01] Paolo ⁭: The produced heat will short the life of battery
[2022-06-18T02:16:13] Unknown: My 43.2ah battery can handle around 9a super safe (.2c) with no harm at all.
[2022-06-18T02:16:14] rosheee: because it is 6P i can charge 6x4.2A
[2022-06-18T02:16:26] rosheee: if u just charge 1 cell u can go 4.2A
[2022-06-18T02:17:46] rosheee: otherwise i could charge 16S5P i have with 1.6A 😆lol
[2022-06-18T02:17:49] Paolo ⁭: You mean 8A single cell?
[2022-06-18T02:17:54] rosheee: no
[2022-06-18T02:17:57] rosheee: 8A = 6P
[2022-06-18T02:17:58] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>

[2022-06-18T03:54:06] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: All 3 are Xiaomi
[2022-06-18T03:54:18] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: Thank you! 😊😊😊
[2022-06-18T03:54:49] Unknown: Super sweet. Is that rear air shock custom? I'm not really familiar with Xiaomi unfortunately
[2022-06-18T03:56:00] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: The one on the left has only suspension on the frontb
[2022-06-18T03:56:23] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: Middle one, yes has an airshock
[2022-06-18T03:56:27] Unknown: Ah yes, I see
[2022-06-18T03:57:51] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: https://youtu.be/EihghOmzSN0
[2022-06-18T03:58:17] Unknown: Steering damper and all. I am thoroughly impressed. Those are some of the nicest, cleanest and well thought out builds I've seen in a long time
[2022-06-18T03:59:34] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: Sold that one in Netherlands for £1800
[2022-06-18T03:59:39] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: Has 2 batteries
[2022-06-18T03:59:58] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: Long range and top speed 35mph
[2022-06-18T04:02:09] Unknown: Does that 11x have Kelly or sabvoton? Or neither? LoL
[2022-06-18T04:13:47] Mirko Boni: Guys, I hung bought the ubox v2 with ADR controller!
[2022-06-18T04:14:11] Mirko Boni: They ship Monday! ❤️
[2022-06-18T04:18:53] Unknown: Nice man.
[2022-06-18T04:19:23] Mirko Boni: Thank you!
[2022-06-18T04:19:48] Unknown: For which scooter?
[2022-06-18T04:20:13] Mirko Boni: I'm thinking about the vsett 10 engines! I like them very much!
[2022-06-18T04:20:25] Mirko Boni: Ninebot G30 max
[2022-06-18T04:20:35] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_5069@18-06-2022_04-20-35.jpg>
[2022-06-18T04:20:35] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_5070@18-06-2022_04-20-35.jpg>
[2022-06-18T04:20:56] Unknown: Oh nice. 10+ motors on g30 max with uBox v2. Sounds like a nice setup man
[2022-06-18T04:21:20] Unknown: I see them Magura levers 🤗
[2022-06-18T04:21:45] Mirko Boni: I hope it has a nice acceleration! Hope it's fun!
[2022-06-18T04:21:53] Mirko Boni: Yess 😂😂😂
[2022-06-18T04:22:09] Mirko Boni: Mt5 4 pistons
[2022-06-18T04:22:55] rosheee: it will but mount ubox to aluminium bottomplate
[2022-06-18T04:23:31] Mirko Boni: Isn't it already with aluminum plate?
[2022-06-18T04:23:40] rosheee: it is in aluminium case
[2022-06-18T04:23:51] rosheee: but the bottomplate has to be aluminium as well ^^
[2022-06-18T04:24:03] Unknown: I'm sure it will be. I think 10+ motors can handle a bit more than uBox v2 can deliver but still should be able to push them hard enough on a small g30 frame to get some super nice power. My scooter is heavy, so my higher amps are pushing a much heavier frame... And my fat ass 😝
[2022-06-18T04:24:31] Mirko Boni: I was thinking of sticking it in the frame!
[2022-06-18T04:24:45] rosheee: pushed 250A per motor motors gave me not nice feeling
[2022-06-18T04:24:58] rosheee: ffs i have to add thermalsensor tomorrow
[2022-06-18T04:25:18] Unknown: They were probably cooking lol. What battery amps?
[2022-06-18T04:25:19] Mirko Boni: Big ass? 🤣🤣🤣
[2022-06-18T04:25:24] rosheee: 90
[2022-06-18T04:25:37] rosheee: was just for 1km
[2022-06-18T04:25:40] Unknown: Also depends how long you you ride them like that for.
[2022-06-18T04:25:43] rosheee: yep
[2022-06-18T04:26:05] Unknown: I run 78/230 all day on my rear and no issues at all
[2022-06-18T04:26:20] Unknown: Motors are strong and stay under 80C at the windings
[2022-06-18T04:26:35] Unknown: PLENTYYYY of power for me honestly
[2022-06-18T04:26:43] Mirko Boni: Ferrofluid ❤️
[2022-06-18T04:26:53] Unknown: Yes .. world of difference
[2022-06-18T04:27:20] Mirko Boni: I would like the idea, but I'm afraid to take an engine apart!
[2022-06-18T04:27:29] Unknown: And I'm sure the 11awg phase wires help. Stock is 12awg so definitely fine for the motors
[2022-06-18T04:28:00] Unknown: All you need to do is pop 1 motor cover off, squirt it in the air gap, reinstall motor cover and done
[2022-06-18T04:28:36] Mirko Boni: Shouldn't it be done channel by channel?
[2022-06-18T04:28:51] Unknown: Some e-bike motors come with a hole drilled in the motor cover to inject ferrofluid. The hole is then plugged with a screw.
[2022-06-18T04:29:13] Mirko Boni: Between the magnets?
[2022-06-18T04:29:14] Unknown: No no... It works it's way around the air gap as soon as the motor spins
[2022-06-18T04:29:18] Unknown: Yes
[2022-06-18T04:29:26] Unknown: Very simple to apply
[2022-06-18T04:29:32] Mirko Boni: Yess exactly
[2022-06-18T04:29:50] rosheee: but this only short peak
[2022-06-18T04:30:34] Unknown: Well, no. I ride with those settings. It's not always pulling that many amps because I'm not always at full throttle. But I run a full battery, 30-40 Mile ride with those settings
[2022-06-18T04:30:58] rosheee: even if u do 100% throttle all time it doesn't pull that ^^'
[2022-06-18T04:31:08] rosheee: it goes down
[2022-06-18T04:31:10] Unknown: Exactly. Those are max settings
[2022-06-18T04:31:33] Unknown: But I'm just saying... That is what I have my controllers set to
[2022-06-18T04:31:45] rosheee: true but the real interesting regarding motortemp for me is
[2022-06-18T04:32:07] rosheee: how many watts average
[2022-06-18T04:32:15] rosheee: when going full throttle
[2022-06-18T04:32:23] rosheee: 8,9,10,11,12kw
[2022-06-18T04:33:23] Unknown: I don't know if I can see average. I can see peak and I can also see real time watts pulled directly on the display. Maybe a log can be averaged in excel or something 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-06-18T04:33:36] rosheee: yes ^__^
[2022-06-18T04:33:41] rosheee: battery fully charged?
[2022-06-18T04:34:25] Unknown: Not yet. Wife is out partying and I'm watching the kids. Work tomorrow 10-4pm. So maybe ride tomorrow or Sunday for sure.
[2022-06-18T04:34:40] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-06-18T04:34:55] Unknown: Yup.. wife... Kids... Not free like bird
[2022-06-18T04:35:04] rosheee: not 4everalone
[2022-06-18T04:35:14] Unknown: Never LoL
[2022-06-18T04:35:34] Unknown: Which is why I ride a lot at night. Time to myself
[2022-06-18T04:35:34] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_5071@18-06-2022_04-35-34.jpg>
[2022-06-18T04:35:49] Unknown: Yes exactly
[2022-06-18T04:36:01] Mirko Boni: Should the ferrofluid be inserted here?
[2022-06-18T04:36:08] Unknown: Squirt 6ml of ferrofluid right there. It will even itself out
[2022-06-18T04:36:11] Mirko Boni: Ok thank you
[2022-06-18T04:36:29] Unknown: You do not need to remove the stator. Only 1 motor cover
[2022-06-18T04:36:47] Mirko Boni: Perfect! Then I order it! 20 ml
[2022-06-18T04:36:51] Unknown: Easy as pie
[2022-06-18T04:37:25] Unknown: Awesome. It helps a lot. Can't really go wrong with it. I would get genuine statorade ferrofluid from grin Tech or a distributor
[2022-06-18T04:37:25] Mirko Boni: Did you put silicone on to close the lid?
[2022-06-18T04:37:42] Mirko Boni: Yes exactly
[2022-06-18T04:38:01] rosheee: never used silicon 😆
[2022-06-18T04:38:11] Unknown: Yes, seal both covers. You can seal after they're installed, just use your finger to go around the motor cover joints
[2022-06-18T04:38:21] rosheee: u ride in rain? :D
[2022-06-18T04:38:33] Mirko Boni: Do you use anything?
[2022-06-18T04:38:41] rosheee: yes
[2022-06-18T04:38:49] rosheee: use silicon where cabels come in on front
[2022-06-18T04:38:52] rosheee: and for bottomplate
[2022-06-18T04:38:54] Mirko Boni: Ok! Wonderful!
[2022-06-18T04:39:04] rosheee: 100% waterproof motors are also waterproof lol
[2022-06-18T04:39:14] Unknown: <photos/photo_5072@18-06-2022_04-39-14.jpg>
[2022-06-18T04:39:36] Mirko Boni: Ok! 🙏🙏🙏
[2022-06-18T04:39:53] rosheee: it helps maybe but on vsett motors not necessary
[2022-06-18T04:40:02] Unknown: Mine leaked a tiny bit of ferrofluid. I suggest running a little silicone at the motor cover to hub joint. Safe that way
[2022-06-18T04:40:09] rosheee: o.O
[2022-06-18T04:40:18] Mirko Boni: Do they have gaskets?
[2022-06-18T04:40:18] Unknown: Yup... They did...
[2022-06-18T04:40:30] Unknown: Also use a tiny bit of silicone on the motor cover screws
[2022-06-18T04:40:36] Unknown: No they don't
[2022-06-18T04:41:18] rosheee: ffs the only problem i ever had with the motors is the cable on rear motor cuz g30 presses on it the cover came off after 1.5years then i had sparks from phase cable XD
[2022-06-18T04:41:45] Mirko Boni: Where do you put the silicone in the hub? I have not understood
[2022-06-18T04:41:58] rosheee: there where hub comes together with cover
[2022-06-18T04:42:03] rosheee: where the screws come in
[2022-06-18T04:42:04] Unknown: <photos/photo_5073@18-06-2022_04-42-04.jpg>
[2022-06-18T04:42:26] Mirko Boni: Ok ok!!
[2022-06-18T04:42:26] rosheee: XD U ALSO PUT AROUND GASKET @ AXLE?
[2022-06-18T04:42:29] Mirko Boni: Perfect
[2022-06-18T04:42:34] Unknown: Silicone at the red. The motor cover joints and the motor cover screws.
[2022-06-18T04:43:11] Mirko Boni: Do I need to buy a special silicone for these motors?
[2022-06-18T04:43:17] Unknown: I use black ATV sealant where the wire enters the axle... And at the motor covers and screws. Silicone works just as good
[2022-06-18T04:43:49] Unknown: Black rtv sealant
[2022-06-18T04:43:51] Unknown: <photos/photo_5074@18-06-2022_04-43-51.jpg>
[2022-06-18T04:43:59] rosheee: hope u ride at these conditions xD
[2022-06-18T04:44:19] Unknown: OMG... Not my baby ❤️ 😝😝
[2022-06-18T04:44:22] rosheee: lol
[2022-06-18T04:44:28] rosheee: why the fuck u put silicon everywhere then?
[2022-06-18T04:44:43] Unknown: To keep the ferrofluid in the hub
[2022-06-18T04:44:49] rosheee: it stays 😆
[2022-06-18T04:44:57] rosheee: where it leaked?
[2022-06-18T04:44:58] Unknown: I had slight leaking broooo
[2022-06-18T04:45:13] Unknown: Out of the screws I think mostly
[2022-06-18T04:45:22] rosheee: o.O ok
[2022-06-18T04:46:21] Unknown: I reassemble the motor covers and then just use my finger to put a small layer of that black sealant around the motor covers and a tiny dab on each screw. Not gobbing it on there lol
[2022-06-18T04:47:06] rosheee: XD
[2022-06-18T04:47:08] Unknown: Bc at first I didn't. Then noticed some liquid metal on my hub. Had to be ferrofluid
[2022-06-18T04:47:32] Mirko Boni: I can't find your black silicone in Italy!
[2022-06-18T04:47:37] Unknown: Maybe my motors on 20s are spinning super speed 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-06-18T04:47:38] rosheee: XD WHUAT
[2022-06-18T04:47:42] rosheee: LOCTITE
[2022-06-18T04:47:53] rosheee: LOCTITE is italian product :D use their silicon/sealant
[2022-06-18T04:48:02] Unknown: Any sealant or gasket maker will do. Clear silicone... Anything like that really
[2022-06-18T04:48:23] Unknown: It is Italian? How bout that LoL
[2022-06-18T04:48:40] rosheee: US
[2022-06-18T04:48:42] rosheee: but made in italy
[2022-06-18T04:48:44] Mirko Boni: So can I buy a simple black silicone?
[2022-06-18T04:48:45] rosheee: at least the stuff i got
[2022-06-18T04:48:48] rosheee: YES
[2022-06-18T04:48:55] Unknown: Yup absolutely
[2022-06-18T04:49:39] Mirko Boni: Ok thank you!
[2022-06-18T04:50:51] Mirko Boni: Greetings! I go to bed! This is 4:50 AM
[2022-06-18T04:50:57] Mirko Boni: Good night
[2022-06-18T04:51:06] rosheee: sleep well :D

[2022-06-18T04:52:00] rosheee: i have magura mt8 for sale if u need 😆60 euro for 2x caliper
[2022-06-18T04:52:14] Mirko Boni: Who knows what speed it will reach!
[2022-06-18T04:52:22] rosheee: what battery?
[2022-06-18T04:52:24] rosheee: 16S?
[2022-06-18T04:52:31] Unknown: 💤 nite man
[2022-06-18T04:52:31] Mirko Boni: Yess
[2022-06-18T04:52:42] Mirko Boni: Thank you!
[2022-06-18T04:52:44] rosheee: this with ubox and 16S @mirkus74

[2022-06-18T04:53:15] Unknown: Hahaha
[2022-06-18T04:53:15] Mirko Boni: Incredibile
[2022-06-18T04:53:26] rosheee: what 😆
[2022-06-18T04:53:42] Mirko Boni: Great!
[2022-06-18T04:53:43] Unknown: Our boy is hilarious
[2022-06-18T04:53:52] rosheee: why?
[2022-06-18T04:54:01] rosheee: just show of ubox performance in g30 ^^
[2022-06-18T04:54:04] Unknown: Bc he's super cute and so nice
[2022-06-18T04:54:09] Unknown: 😝
[2022-06-18T04:54:32] rosheee: that he is even happier
[2022-06-18T04:54:32] Unknown: Well, you too RS 🧐
[2022-06-18T04:54:42] Unknown: Happier than Happy?!
[2022-06-18T04:54:47] Mirko Boni: Who knows what speed it will reach!
[2022-06-18T04:54:48] rosheee: ubox is def. not for high kv motors ^^'
[2022-06-18T04:54:58] rosheee: ask paolo for settings ^^
[2022-06-18T04:55:01] rosheee: he told me 15S 100kmh
[2022-06-18T04:55:06] rosheee: with blade motors
[2022-06-18T04:55:19] rosheee: ubox + dualtron motors = fail
[2022-06-18T04:55:26] rosheee: but even tronic controllers ^^'
[2022-06-18T04:55:36] rosheee: they use it in idk. rion scooters? lol
[2022-06-18T04:55:43] Unknown: That's crazy. Really thought the tronics would hang
[2022-06-18T04:55:44] rosheee: at least the 250A
[2022-06-18T04:55:52] rosheee: 250A + high kv motors = fail
[2022-06-18T04:55:58] rosheee: maybe with the new cooling
[2022-06-18T04:56:05] Unknown: Nuts
[2022-06-18T04:56:15] rosheee: but even with a bigger heatsink than they use it runs hot
[2022-06-18T04:56:28] rosheee: cuz tested with 1^^'
[2022-06-18T04:57:03] Unknown: Crazy. It's basically Lil FOCer.. right?
[2022-06-18T04:57:08] rosheee: it is
[2022-06-18T04:57:28] rosheee: they should get v3.1 lil focer last month
[2022-06-18T04:57:29] rosheee: still waiting
[2022-06-18T04:57:39] rosheee: if not available until end of month have to order again rion..omg
[2022-06-18T04:58:33] rosheee: lol
[2022-06-18T04:58:41] rosheee: if i order On-board computer — $110 @ nucular
[2022-06-18T04:58:45] rosheee: d i need displaycase as well 😆?
[2022-06-18T04:58:47] rosheee: and the glass xD?
[2022-06-18T04:58:54] rosheee: and crimped wires?
[2022-06-18T04:59:12] rosheee: Adam
[2022-06-18T05:03:24] Unknown: You just need the controller(s), display and I would get a spare set of the crimped wires. If you get potted you won't need the wires since you can't access the inside ports anyways.
[2022-06-18T05:03:36] Unknown: If potted, you tell them what wires you want hooked up inside
[2022-06-18T08:21:55] sombre_enfant: Same problem over here, i cutted the screw too
[2022-06-18T10:41:52] Face de Pin Sucé: <sticker>

[2022-06-18T10:45:02] Mirono escooters: It acts like a cc cv? The controller??
[2022-06-18T10:51:34] Mirono escooters: Caliper or a full brake?

[2022-06-18T12:46:59] Mirono escooters: Good.. morning? ;)
[2022-06-18T12:47:26] Mirko Boni: 👋 Ciao
[2022-06-18T12:48:18] Happy Giraffe: Mirko was partying all night😂
[2022-06-18T12:49:08] Mirko Boni: Ah ah ah ah ah
[2022-06-18T12:49:27] Mirko Boni: Not only! I spent $ 450
[2022-06-18T12:49:48] Mirko Boni: <sticker>
[2022-06-18T12:51:04] Mirko Boni: All Adam and @roscheeee fault
[2022-06-18T12:51:42] Mirko Boni: They made me spend the money! 😜😜😜
[2022-06-18T12:51:42] Mirono escooters: Bastards
[2022-06-18T12:51:56] Mirko Boni: <sticker>
[2022-06-18T12:53:19] Mirko Boni: Today I have to decide which engine to order!
[2022-06-18T12:57:20] Happy Giraffe: Choose wisely
[2022-06-18T12:58:08] Mirono escooters: Xiaomi 250w
[2022-06-18T13:01:20] Mirko Boni: Yess! Exactly
[2022-06-18T13:01:37] Mirko Boni: Blade or vsett 10 engine?
[2022-06-18T13:01:45] Mirko Boni: 🤔🤔🤔
[2022-06-18T13:01:57] Mirko Boni: Naaa! 😂😂😂
[2022-06-18T13:06:59] Happy Giraffe: Maybe Vsett if you have the money, it can handle the heat propably better. Ask Adam
[2022-06-18T13:08:03] Mirko Boni: Adam He explained me well how it works! I'll put the ferrofluid!
[2022-06-18T13:19:03] Happy Giraffe: Yes, was just thinking if added cost from Vsett motor is worth it for you
[2022-06-18T13:26:23] Mirko Boni: Actually I pay more for the blade motor than the vsett motor!
[2022-06-18T13:35:02] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_5075@18-06-2022_13-35-02.jpg>
[2022-06-18T13:36:48] Paolo ⁭: contrary, blade it’s more efficient and design with heatsink
[2022-06-18T13:37:21] Paolo ⁭: Tax will be charged at delivery
[2022-06-18T13:45:38] Mirko Boni: Tranquillo Paolo, sto solo facendo un paragone!
[2022-06-18T13:53:32] sombre_enfant: Maybe you can buy vsett from France theres a few retailer who sell them then ship to italy
[2022-06-18T14:03:39] Mirko Boni: Conosci il link?
[2022-06-18T14:04:11] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-06-18T14:04:57] Happy Giraffe: I dont think so but need to have thermal sensor. Mine became warm at 50/120A on summer tho its only one motor so load is double to awd
[2022-06-18T14:05:30] sombre_enfant: https://emobilityshop.com/fr/moteur-vsett/3169-moteur-60v-1400w-vsett-10.html
[2022-06-18T14:05:41] Mirko Boni: Do you have blade motor?
[2022-06-18T14:05:49] Happy Giraffe: Yes had one
[2022-06-18T14:06:09] Mirko Boni: Ok ok!
[2022-06-18T14:06:18] Mirko Boni: Wonderful! Thank you
[2022-06-18T14:06:22] Happy Giraffe: I used one motor so it will be easier if two motors pull you
[2022-06-18T14:14:34] Mirko Boni: However I will use the ferrofluid!
[2022-06-18T14:24:54] Happy Giraffe: Sharing the load to only 50% makes bigger difference but yes you will be ok
[2022-06-18T14:27:05] Mirko Boni: I agree, in fact I will install two engines!
[2022-06-18T14:28:24] Paolo ⁭: Buy another vsett motor then self check
[2022-06-18T14:29:27] Paolo ⁭: The ex motor of blade was same of vsett, but they’ve switched to LY because is more efficient
[2022-06-18T15:43:44] Artem Bulashev: There is no sense for that price, without tax, in eu it is cheaper
[2022-06-18T15:44:23] sombre_enfant: Chinese seller make you avoid taxes most of time
[2022-06-18T15:50:13] Artem Bulashev: Aliexpress only handles tax up to 150€ per order
[2022-06-18T15:50:24] Artem Bulashev: above it is not included
[2022-06-18T15:50:33] Artem Bulashev: I think in eu same motor is 300€
[2022-06-18T15:51:34] sombre_enfant: I buyed 384 usd from ali seller arranged me tax by shipping to some of his man in Portugal then ship to me
[2022-06-18T15:51:53] Artem Bulashev: 210€ and 5€ coupon and cheaper shipping
[2022-06-18T15:54:25] sombre_enfant: Idk if it can be shipped to italy tho, where i work sometime they got contract with vsett france but we never ordered them anything
[2022-06-18T15:54:27] Paolo ⁭: Vsett motor?
[2022-06-18T15:54:48] sombre_enfant: Nope the shitty blade and brake
[2022-06-18T15:55:25] Paolo ⁭: What about blade motor
[2022-06-18T15:55:26] sombre_enfant: When usd was cheaper than euro also😎
[2022-06-18T15:55:29] Paolo ⁭: Still no resolved?
[2022-06-18T15:57:14] sombre_enfant: Im waiting for a refund of some money because its not normal to buy something and need to rework that much...

[2022-06-18T16:01:20] Paolo ⁭: I got 4 motors with cracked rim and no refund 🥲
[2022-06-18T16:01:52] sombre_enfant: Yeah longyu seems like they dont got any quality check
[2022-06-18T16:01:59] Paolo ⁭: And the rim with magnets cost me more than half of motor price
[2022-06-18T16:02:10] Paolo ⁭: No that is no because they
[2022-06-18T16:02:29] Paolo ⁭: I got them from blade factory
[2022-06-18T16:02:40] Paolo ⁭: Now I get directly from longyu and all perfect
[2022-06-18T16:03:38] sombre_enfant: How can you manage to be off tolérance on an easy part like that, i had to do doodoo stuff i'll wont use the lathe for such shit
[2022-06-18T16:04:06] sombre_enfant: I got them from blade factory too
[2022-06-18T16:04:42] sombre_enfant: Atleast i didnt bought direct and done through alibaba
[2022-06-18T16:05:14] Paolo ⁭: Longyu have no alibaba account
[2022-06-18T16:05:25] Paolo ⁭: They just sell in China
[2022-06-18T16:05:37] Mirko Boni: Purtroppo i messaggi con la parola tasse e dogana vengono bloccati automaticamente da aliexpress!
[2022-06-18T16:05:53] Mirko Boni: Exactly
[2022-06-18T16:06:26] Paolo ⁭: Basta sapere come scrivere
[2022-06-18T16:07:01] Paolo ⁭: Ci sono caratteri magici 😂
[2022-06-18T16:08:03] Mirko Boni: 😂😂😂😂
[2022-06-18T16:08:12] Mirko Boni: Tu ne sai una più del diavolo
[2022-06-18T16:09:40] Mirko Boni: I tuoi motori sono perfetti @PaoloWu ? Mi puoi rassicurare in merito? Io ho paura che possa succedere quello che é successo a @lBabacar
[2022-06-18T16:10:19] Paolo ⁭: Il vantaggio di comprare le cose in Italia è questo😂
[2022-06-18T16:12:43] Mirko Boni: Ah ah ah ah ah! Però io volevo sapere se tu prima di spedire puoi fare un controllo approfondito
[2022-06-18T16:13:20] Mirko Boni: Così te li prendo subito! Affare fatto?
[2022-06-18T16:13:25] Paolo ⁭: 👍
[2022-06-18T16:13:47] Mirko Boni: Ok! Così sia!
[2022-06-18T16:14:03] Mirko Boni: Sei un furbacchione tu 😂😂😂😂
[2022-06-18T16:28:45] Mirono escooters: My vesc isnt liking 34* ambient..
[2022-06-18T16:29:01] Mirono escooters: When i mount vesc on heatsink, do i need to remove paint?
[2022-06-18T16:29:02] Paolo ⁭: 80 degree vesc
[2022-06-18T16:29:04] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-06-18T16:29:15] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2022-06-18T16:29:28] Mirono escooters: 60/200a, give it a break😂😂
[2022-06-18T16:33:56] D J: Easy easy 😅
[2022-06-18T16:34:28] Mirono escooters: Its in a bag, haha, 0 cooling
[2022-06-18T16:35:21] Mirko Boni: Woow!
[2022-06-18T16:35:24] Кирилл: Lol, i had 95 degrees
[2022-06-18T16:35:58] Кирилл: Pushed 100a batt/200a phase a little
[2022-06-18T16:36:23] Кирилл: 10 sec and up to 95 degrees
[2022-06-18T16:36:43] Mirono escooters: Here it took a few minutes. I felt when it started lower power
[2022-06-18T16:36:54] Mirono escooters: Need heatsink. I got a sabvoton case, so that will help a lot
[2022-06-18T16:37:08] Кирилл: Ye, strong heatsink is a must
[2022-06-18T16:37:08] Mirono escooters: Just dont know if paint does anything for thermal transfer
[2022-06-18T16:37:21] Mirono escooters: Sabvoton heatsink is huge😀
[2022-06-18T16:37:41] Кирилл: Yes, as @roscheeee helped me with this. Clear black paint from the rear side of ubox where fets are
[2022-06-18T16:37:58] Кирилл: And mount with thermal pad or thermal paste onto alumplate
[2022-06-18T16:38:01] Mirono escooters: Its makerx but same principle
[2022-06-18T16:38:09] Mirono escooters: Paste, and 4 bolts ready
[2022-06-18T16:38:21] Mirono escooters: Ill remove paint carefully
[2022-06-18T16:39:24] Mirono escooters: My motor was almost too hot to the touch, but its doing well for the power i push it, haha. Ferrofluid helps alot
[2022-06-18T16:51:33] Mirko Boni: I have decided to lock it in the frame! I remove the track! I put the thermal paste on him and close the bolts!
[2022-06-18T16:51:37] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_5080@18-06-2022_16-51-37.jpg>
[2022-06-18T16:57:59] sombre_enfant: You sure it fit here ?
[2022-06-18T16:59:06] Mirko Boni: Yess! La batteria è lunga 34,5 cm
[2022-06-18T17:25:41] rosheee: Screw?
[2022-06-18T17:26:11] rosheee: Not rly xD better put on bottomplate
[2022-06-18T17:28:09] sombre_enfant: On the torque arm
[2022-06-18T17:29:08] Mirko Boni: What is the bottomplate?
[2022-06-18T17:29:35] rosheee: Spacer
[2022-06-18T17:29:40] rosheee: Sry
[2022-06-18T17:29:42] rosheee: The plate
[2022-06-18T17:29:46] rosheee: Ffa
[2022-06-18T17:29:57] rosheee: <photos/photo_5081@18-06-2022_17-29-57.jpg>
[2022-06-18T17:30:01] rosheee: This
[2022-06-18T17:30:24] Mirko Boni: But isn't it better to stick it in the bottom of the frame?
[2022-06-18T17:30:29] Mirko Boni: Exactly
[2022-06-18T17:30:48] Кирилл: Yep, for air cooling and without bottom plate😅
[2022-06-18T17:30:51] Mirko Boni: I will do so! I mount in the bottom of the frame!
[2022-06-18T17:31:00] rosheee: Not good xD
[2022-06-18T17:31:10] rosheee: Tried it a well
[2022-06-18T17:31:16] rosheee: +10 degrees mpre
[2022-06-18T17:31:20] Mirono escooters: Bottom of frame, its a big heatsink, no?
[2022-06-18T17:32:05] Mirko Boni: Sorry, do you recommend fitting in the steel footrest cover?
[2022-06-18T17:32:43] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_5082@18-06-2022_17-32-43.jpg>
[2022-06-18T17:32:50] Mirko Boni: Photo by @lBabacar
[2022-06-18T17:33:58] Mirko Boni: But doesn't summer take the heat of the asphalt?
[2022-06-18T17:35:42] Mirono escooters: How
[2022-06-18T17:39:06] Mirko Boni: I work in a body that manages the streets! I know the materials well, the asphalt reaches 60/70 degrees celsius in summer!
[2022-06-18T17:39:29] Mirko Boni: These temperatures heat up the steel lid!
[2022-06-18T17:43:31] sombre_enfant: Right
[2022-06-18T17:43:38] Mirono escooters: How will it heat the lid?
[2022-06-18T17:47:28] Mirko Boni: The heat is radiated from the asphalt upwards!
[2022-06-18T17:47:57] Mirono escooters: Ö
[2022-06-18T17:48:03] Mirono escooters: Air will still cool it
[2022-06-18T17:54:08] Mirko Boni: I do not doubt it! I trust you! How do you do it? Do you mount the ubox in the steel lid?
[2022-06-18T17:54:42] Mirko Boni: Thermal paddle or just thermal paste?
[2022-06-18T18:19:54] Unknown: Yea definitely not enough. I would put another 3ml. Some soaks into the stator metal so the amount of actual floating fluid will be slightly less. 6ml total is good for Vsett 10 or blade motors with 50mm magnets and 6-6.1 inch diameter hub
[2022-06-18T18:22:10] Unknown: For sure. 6ml is perfect. Good coverage and effectiveness but doesn't negatively affect rolling resistance
[2022-06-18T18:36:53] Mirono escooters: would ff even add any feelable resistance?
[2022-06-18T18:49:21] Unknown: If you don't overfill it definitely has very little if any noticable resistance. There are some who believe less rolling resistance because it acts a lubricant 🤷🏻‍♂️. If you put too much and overfill it will definitely create resistance. My rear has a bit because after I notice a tiny bit leaking from the cover screws, I think I added way more than it lost lol. Rear probably has about 8ml if I had to guess. Slight bit of resistance compared to the front. No biggie in my view but may clean it out and go back with a measured 6.5ml so I know for absolute sure what's in there
[2022-06-18T18:50:12] Mirono escooters: Hmm id rather do for ebike abit too much thrn too little, if its rlly too much it will force itself away :)
[2022-06-18T18:50:18] Mirono escooters: Or so i think, haha
[2022-06-18T18:50:36] Mirono escooters: Still with the power we run, eh, i wouldnt b bothered so much
[2022-06-18T18:51:08] Unknown: LoL. Yea I mean I highly doubt a bit of resistance will have any noticable effect on top speed or efficiency
[2022-06-18T18:51:18] Unknown: Yup, my thoughts exactly
[2022-06-18T18:51:52] Mirono escooters: I want raw power, if i i lose 1% efficienty eh fuck dat
[2022-06-18T18:52:06] Mirono escooters: Im still scared i didnt add enough as i couldnt see, but like 15ml approx, ebike should b plenty
[2022-06-18T19:20:16] rosheee: 2x caliper
[2022-06-18T19:20:34] rosheee: yes xD
[2022-06-18T19:20:52] rosheee: i added to much and had first time cut less torque less speed more heat at esc and motors
[2022-06-18T19:23:21] Mirono escooters: Hm
[2022-06-18T19:25:02] Unknown: Yup 10ml fluid will do that lol
[2022-06-18T19:29:07] Unknown: Or did you say 12ml?
[2022-06-18T19:31:25] rosheee: idk how much i added
[2022-06-18T19:31:28] rosheee: but it was 2 much xD
[2022-06-18T19:31:31] rosheee: more than 7ml
[2022-06-18T20:04:30] rosheee: heatpipes best
[2022-06-18T20:04:31] rosheee: holyshit
[2022-06-18T20:19:08] rosheee: motor heat goes up and esc ^^'
[2022-06-18T20:20:17] Mirono escooters: F
[2022-06-18T20:20:34] rosheee: XD ubox went up to 75 degrees and motors lol
[2022-06-18T20:20:52] Mirono escooters: Hmm, now u scare me :)
[2022-06-18T20:21:11] rosheee: i thought the warme the shit gets the less resistance ^'
[2022-06-18T20:21:14] rosheee: but nope
[2022-06-18T20:21:28] rosheee: motor cover was like 70 degrees
[2022-06-18T20:21:29] rosheee: XD
[2022-06-18T20:23:47] Mirono escooters: How would i even know if i added too much in ebike
[2022-06-18T20:23:59] Mirono escooters: Wouldnt the excess get flipped out
[2022-06-18T20:24:10] Mirono escooters: I know my motor draw from before adding so ill compare
[2022-06-18T20:31:16] rosheee: like i said xD
[2022-06-18T20:31:19] rosheee: u feel it
[2022-06-18T20:33:07] Unknown: Just spin the tire on the bench before to see normal resistance with no fluid. Then check after Should have about the same hang time for a free spinning wheel in the air by hand
[2022-06-18T20:35:00] Unknown: Now I have to recheck my rear lol. Motor covers back off, try n save as much fluid as possible and refill with proper measured amount 🙄
[2022-06-18T20:54:00] rosheee: changed bearings holyfuck
[2022-06-18T20:54:00] rosheee: <photos/photo_5083@18-06-2022_20-54-00.jpg>
[2022-06-18T20:59:43] Unknown: Dem metal seals 🙈
[2022-06-18T21:00:03] rosheee: yah and?
[2022-06-18T21:00:13] Unknown: Curious to see them after 500km. Make sure your simmerings are set properly and make good seal
[2022-06-18T21:00:38] Unknown: I bought better simmerings, both sides with springs. They seal better than the stock ones
[2022-06-18T21:00:59] rosheee: U dont even ride in wet conditoons
[2022-06-18T21:01:13] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-06-18T21:02:49] Unknown: If @artBula wants to pin this, all of the bearings in the 10+ are as follows: Vsett 9/9+, 11, 8/8+ can be different sizes. These are confirmed for 10+ ONLY Wheels: 2 of each size 6202 2RSH (C3 clearance is preferred) 6004 2RSH (C3 clearance is preferred) Wheel Simmerings: 2 of each size 20x28x6 15x25x5 Swingarms (4): 16287 2RS ( 61902-16 identical) Headset/Stem (2): 30x41x6.5 36° x 45°
[2022-06-18T21:03:04] Unknown: <photos/photo_5084@18-06-2022_21-03-04.jpg>
[2022-06-18T21:03:25] Unknown: I don't. But this was my stock bearing with stock simmerings after a few hundred miles
[2022-06-18T21:03:32] Unknown: Rusted
[2022-06-18T21:03:46] rosheee: lol D
[2022-06-18T21:03:47] Unknown: That's sweet man.
[2022-06-18T21:03:55] rosheee: that motor hadn't sealing
[2022-06-18T21:04:02] rosheee: and other problems
[2022-06-18T21:04:08] Unknown: Yes.. was stock motor untouched
[2022-06-18T21:04:22] Unknown: No bro. Stock. Dead stock. Before I ever opened it
[2022-06-18T21:04:34] Mirono escooters: I will, but i already refitted brake and didnt feel diff

[2022-06-18T21:05:01] Mirono escooters: Awesome
[2022-06-18T21:05:24] Mirono escooters: Im afraid with cooled vesc and not limited power my motor wont like it 😂 need those heatsinks
[2022-06-18T21:07:29] Unknown: I hear ya.. I would like as well for Vsett motors just to be on the safe side. Haven't heated up to anywhere near dangerous temps yet but also haven't had 90-100°F days yet. We're okay with 80-85F temps tho
[2022-06-18T21:08:10] rosheee: no xD
[2022-06-18T21:08:10] rosheee: touched alot
[2022-06-18T21:08:10] rosheee: i can show u my motor
[2022-06-18T21:08:14] rosheee: water came in but not where the bearings are
[2022-06-18T21:10:31] Unknown: I'm saying, that picture was of my slightly rusted bearing after riding my stock setup for a few hundred miles. I opened the motor for the first time and found that rusted bearing race
[2022-06-18T21:18:10] rosheee: lol i opened that motor couple times xD
[2022-06-18T21:18:10] rosheee: aha xD
[2022-06-18T21:18:10] rosheee: mine looked same
[2022-06-18T21:25:01] Unknown: So just keep an eye out for rusting with those metal shields. Definitely don't want the actual balls to rust lol. No rusty balls!! 😝

[2022-06-18T22:26:41] rosheee: yes
[2022-06-18T22:26:44] rosheee: then put in heatpipes
[2022-06-18T22:26:59] rosheee: to bring heat from where controller is to otherside
[2022-06-18T22:27:02] rosheee: 3 heatpipes

[2022-06-18T23:42:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you have the tech for it, yes
[2022-06-18T23:43:58] Konstantin: Today discovered... Apply recuperation, go down on subway, and when wheel jump in air, when land to ground, brake stop work, but I'm still pressing brake... Hah ;)
[2022-06-18T23:58:15] Unknown: Yes. Cc to CV threshold and charge rates are controlled thru the controller. Any power supply or battery can be used as a "charger" and controller regulates cc to cv. I did a super slow charge, 21HR mark. Started at 4a and now is incrementally ramping down to 1a as it approaches 84v full charge
[2022-06-18T23:58:34] Mirono escooters: Ok i love that..
[2022-06-18T23:59:05] rosheee: now go for a ride :D
[2022-06-18T23:59:56] Unknown: Yuppers. Amazing feature. Only other controller to have such feature was Adaptto mini and max which is no longer made. Nucs are loosely based off the same idea in general but way more advanced
[2022-06-19T00:01:16] Unknown: So you can for instance... Carry a spare scooter battery (or any battery) in your backpack. When you need a charge, just plug in the battery to your charge plug and your scooter battery will charge from the spare battery
[2022-06-19T00:01:27] Mirono escooters: So nice. Thats like a adjustable charger but better. Can use any power supply
[2022-06-19T00:01:37] Paolo ⁭: Something like these and no worry
[2022-06-19T00:02:38] Unknown: It way better than any cc to CV charger honestly. Only requirement is the power supply/battery needs to have a voltage under the battery you're charging. Can be any voltage lower... Motor phase wire acts as coil and ramps up voltage
[2022-06-19T00:03:55] rosheee: XD

[2022-06-19T02:13:08] Unknown: My MDR -C rotors are brand new. Well, only a few rides on them but rubbed from new. There is Soo little clearance between pads and rotors
[2022-06-19T02:13:56] Unknown: Like I said I reset pistons during bleed too, pushed all the way back in before I closed off lever side bleed port so I don't think they're overfilled at all

[2022-06-19T02:22:10] Mirko Boni: When I write that I have no problems, it is because in my scooter the discs do not rub!
[2022-06-19T02:22:35] Unknown: I know lol... I try the re-bleed tonight
[2022-06-19T02:22:51] Unknown: <video_file>

[2022-06-19T02:24:10] Unknown: Ok.. is really super close tho
[2022-06-19T02:24:14] Mirko Boni: Just yesterday dear @PaoloWu , I tried to brake from 60 to 0 km / h, the disc reached 110 degrees, the support in pla plus was at 35 degrees!
[2022-06-19T02:24:30] rosheee: 110 degrees is nothing
[2022-06-19T02:25:25] Mirko Boni: But does it make noise when moving? Everything seems ok to me!
[2022-06-19T02:26:58] Mirko Boni: But I don't take winding paths! I never get over those temperatures! I never go downhill! My path is flat!

[2022-06-19T13:47:58] Happy Giraffe: That's perfectly fine
[2022-06-19T13:48:12] Happy Giraffe: After a week it will settle
[2022-06-19T13:58:20] Mirono escooters: How will it "settle"?
[2022-06-19T14:14:32] Happy Giraffe: By wearing down 0.1mm
[2022-06-19T14:14:38] Mirono escooters: O
[2022-06-19T14:14:57] Mirono escooters: Still it will push brake pads closer
[2022-06-19T14:15:10] Mirono escooters: I bought such a brake adjuster, so i can perfect it
[2022-06-19T14:15:11] Happy Giraffe: But if rub doesnt heat disc or stop wheelspin it doesnt matter
[2022-06-19T14:15:28] Happy Giraffe: Nah they retract
[2022-06-19T14:15:36] Mirono escooters: Only abit
[2022-06-19T14:15:46] Happy Giraffe: I never had issue
[2022-06-19T14:15:59] Mirono escooters: So hard adjusting brake disk, the tolerances are smaller then my peepee
[2022-06-19T14:16:04] Happy Giraffe: Tight tolerances but works
[2022-06-19T14:16:17] Mirono escooters: Ill perfect it ☻️
[2022-06-19T14:16:24] Happy Giraffe: Just go ride, it's good enough
[2022-06-19T14:16:36] Mirono escooters: It doesnt rub now, so im good
[2022-06-19T14:16:56] Mirono escooters: Hope your front disk is straight of that xiaomi
[2022-06-19T14:18:12] Mirono escooters: Apart from my ebike, i need the adjuster for the other scoots, some are very fucked ☻️😂

[2022-06-19T15:35:38] Happy Giraffe: If my torque sensor outputs 1.5-3.5v then I have to use 5v mode? Only 0.2v above limit
[2022-06-19T15:36:23] Mirono escooters: Tjat sucks
[2022-06-19T20:44:57] Unknown: Ok guys. Got the brakes all set lol. Front and rear have no rub, solid levers, true rotors. Good to go. Little thing I did was when bleeding I took the piston blocks out and used the syringe to push all 4 pistons out about halfway. I lubed them and seals/orings with mineral oil to make sure they have smooth and free action. I think periodically that might be a good idea to keep them moving as freely as possible. The pistons and pads have no springs on the Maguras, so for the pistons to retract they rely on negative vaccum in the lines (when you let go of the lever). So there is basically no "assist" that helps the pistons get pushed back in. Leads me to believe they need to be totally smooth and freely moving to work optimal
[2022-06-19T20:53:51] Mirko Boni: Great explanation! Thanks Adam!
[2022-06-19T20:54:23] Mirko Boni: I bought a 5V throttle!
[2022-06-19T21:03:17] Mirono escooters: Yes lube em!!
[2022-06-19T21:03:46] Mirono escooters: Mine were 2 stuck from shop,.must have sat too long in warehouse. Needed a little motivation, now work
[2022-06-19T21:03:53] Mirono escooters: I was braking with 2 and that wasnt good
[2022-06-19T21:14:23] rosheee: And use the special bleeding technique?
[2022-06-19T21:19:09] Unknown: Nah just normal bleed. All working perfectly 👌
[2022-06-19T21:19:26] rosheee: Maybe u get that noise again when pads used quiet a bit. Cuz not 100% touching rotor
[2022-06-19T21:20:00] rosheee: Ok. When u watch maguras bleeding video they do it as well. Just saying
[2022-06-19T21:20:10] Ofek 🐥: I used a bleeding funnel and pumped the brake when the caliper lifted and draining to the funnel. Worked great 😃 🙈

[2022-06-19T21:21:52] Mirono escooters: Yep that or u have risk of only 2 moving :))
[2022-06-19T21:21:59] Unknown: Yea I saw them do that just a little tricky with my lines routed thru the stem and deck. Didn't feel like folding the stem and all that. I got it all good
[2022-06-19T21:24:12] Unknown: Another trick I found is before you touch the levers when pistons are all the way seated, mount and center the calipers by eye dead center on the rotor. Then when you squeeze the lever, the pistons will automatically end up at the same level. If you squeeze the lever while the caliper is still loose on the mounts the pistons can travel and seat really uneven
[2022-06-19T21:25:43] Unknown: Yup I believe it. After pushing the pistons out and lubing them I noticed the action was actually a lot smoother. You can actually use the syringe to actuate the pistons carefully with the piston blocks removed. You can see if one is stuck or if one is pushing out faster/slower than the others

[2022-06-19T22:34:33] Happy Giraffe: Be careful to only use 5v mode on adc adapter board, otherwise there can be damage. Connect all other cables correctly first and battery last

[2022-06-21T17:53:09] gil guy: Glop . Someone have good results with 6.5" hoverboard hubs and vesc ? for me , it's noisy at accel & brake , even in foc sensored . tried vesc , 4.12Vedder , 4.2 and 6.1Flipsky .. tuned many parameters , multiples detections .. no way .. shit ..
[2022-06-21T17:53:28] Mirono escooters: Halls?
[2022-06-21T17:55:06] gil guy: no problem . halls detected .
[2022-06-21T17:55:18] Mirono escooters: Try retestrun
[2022-06-21T17:55:29] Mirono escooters: Wich power, wich settings, more info
[2022-06-21T17:55:35] Mirono escooters: Also noisy, wich noise
[2022-06-21T17:58:49] gil guy: these hubs can handle 40A in 12S , very silent and torquy with hoverboard esc or Lingyi skate esc in foc sensored . but with all vesc tested : switching noises in strong accel or strong brake . cogging too .
[2022-06-21T17:59:28] Mirono escooters: Try lowering your sensorless erpm, that worked for me
[2022-06-21T17:59:58] gil guy: auto detection , or manual with tuning test current , flux linkage , pwm ..etc .. no way .
[2022-06-21T18:00:24] Mirono escooters: If you scroll up, i had same problemo, after countless hours of messing
[2022-06-21T18:01:28] gil guy: ok . I will try . but same noise appear in sensored phase and sensorless too .
[2022-06-21T18:02:11] Mirono escooters: Ah sensorless too. Nevermind.
[2022-06-21T18:02:21] Mirono escooters: Tried bldc?
[2022-06-21T18:02:36] gil guy: less noise with 5wires/windingand 30mm magnets than 4W/W and 25mm magnets.but not optimal .
[2022-06-21T18:03:26] gil guy: yes , but not interested . too noisy for me . when you test a 0 noise foc ESC ..😍
[2022-06-21T18:03:51] Mirono escooters: Haha I know xd
[2022-06-21T18:03:55] Mirono escooters: Sounds like f1
[2022-06-21T18:09:13] gil guy: I think vesc can do it . very low noise a low current . but when you need power ..vesc seem to modify switchng timing . I will use my oscilloscope to see waves . these motors are rated for 350W in hoverboards . I put them 1500W without problem on others ESC like this one
[2022-06-21T18:10:03] Mirono escooters: 1500w? Nice. I will build a drift trike with em
[2022-06-21T18:10:09] Mirono escooters: Im sadly too poor for vesc for that one, haha
[2022-06-21T18:11:02] Rowan Ross: Makerx dv4
[2022-06-21T18:11:59] Mirono escooters: Got makerx 75300 in my ebike i love it
[2022-06-21T18:12:28] Mirono escooters: But to spend so much on a drift trike, idk.. i gonna start with cheap escs. Can always upgrade
[2022-06-21T18:13:21] Mirono escooters: Makerx, where do they ship from?
[2022-06-21T18:16:32] gil guy: these lingyi are 50bucks , big or small version ,with remote . non programmable(not found?), but you can decrease current shunts to half value to increase power ( need better cooling of course) . 6s to 10s capable, can hack to 12s with 2 resistors . no problem . just a little jerk in 12s at re-acceleration after a free wheel . so never leave it totally .. very very smotth in 10s and lower ..😋 and ZERO noise in sensored foc mode . BLDC trapézoidal without halls ..
[2022-06-21T18:17:12] Mirono escooters: Hmm, i will start with 12€ ebike controllers😂😂😂
[2022-06-21T18:17:29] Mirono escooters: Its justtt to test iff this has potential, dont kill me.
[2022-06-21T18:17:53] Mirono escooters: Maybe @roscheeee can donate me one 😘😘😘
[2022-06-21T18:18:19] gil guy: same .. improve coolling when reduce current shunt . work fine .
[2022-06-21T18:18:45] Mirono escooters: I dont think i will shunt 350w 12€ controllers☻️😱
[2022-06-21T18:19:27] Mirono escooters: I think i know what i will do actually I got loads of xiaomi controllers, and you can mod these to absolutely death Andddd smart guys figured out how to run VESC firmware on it😱
[2022-06-21T18:19:48] Mirono escooters: So for approx 50 bucks i have vesc dual 100a controllers, sounds good. Lol
[2022-06-21T18:19:54] Mirono escooters: And then someone tested it
[2022-06-21T18:22:04] gil guy: yes. smartESC group..
[2022-06-21T18:22:13] gil guy: not tried yet
[2022-06-21T18:22:18] Mirono escooters: Lovely project

[2022-06-21T18:58:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This is normal 😅
[2022-06-21T19:02:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Get shit out of the crap box😁
[2022-06-21T19:03:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Would love to ride it🤣
[2022-06-21T19:03:39] Unknown: Haha. Love it. Everything excess ❤️
[2022-06-21T19:04:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Look for balls also
[2022-06-21T19:04:38] Кирилл: Wouldn't hurt
[2022-06-21T19:05:29] Unknown: Yes check for solder balls and blobs. The main leads look dry to me, almost cold joints with not enough solder and heat. The phases look okay like the solder actually flowed.
[2022-06-21T19:05:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: One day all gets in place
[2022-06-21T19:06:01] Martin Kaktits: but for real tho, i need the batt. im driving on a corpse
[2022-06-21T19:06:15] Кирилл: Thats definitely cold soldering..
[2022-06-21T19:06:35] Кирилл: Battery ones
[2022-06-21T19:06:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I do similar and than at right time you pull the rabbit out from the hat ,like boom😁
[2022-06-21T19:06:56] Unknown: Yup, main battery leads no bueno
[2022-06-21T19:08:15] Unknown: If resoldering just make super sure you don't flow solder from + to - pads/wires. Those are fairly close and can easily be crossed with too much solder. Maybe is why they dry soldered 😂
[2022-06-21T19:11:04] Unknown: Ehh, actually not that close. Solder away lol. And when/if you do... Push the wires down onto the pads while the solder is molten. I use ceramic tweezers for that, won't melt and won't stick. Right now they have the wires sitting above the PCB pads and mostly solder is making the connection. You want the actual wire flattened on the pads. Solder sucks horribly as a conductor. You don't want solder making the connection, rather solder keeping and holding the wire/pad connection
[2022-06-21T19:11:07] rosheee: Question
[2022-06-21T19:11:09] Кирилл: It feels like they are just not drowned there, you can just warm up the top with a soldering iron better and add 2 bosses of tin on top
[2022-06-21T19:11:35] rosheee: No solder inside better?
[2022-06-21T19:13:27] Unknown: I always fill completely until solder starts flowing back out of the bullet. Again, you want the wire touching the bullet, not floating in the center. I would trim back the silicone so the wire can push in further, bottom out the wire into the bullet... Then solder fill completely until it is flowing back out
[2022-06-21T19:13:39] Unknown: Air doesn't conduct electricity 😜
[2022-06-21T19:30:08] Mirono escooters: Better stick out abit more and heatshrink
[2022-06-21T20:11:09] rosheee: Done

[2022-06-22T00:12:12] Unknown: Yea not really the same. Those 3d printed ram air intakes act as blowers forcing cool air thru the hub over and under the stator and out the opposite side
[2022-06-22T00:22:09] rosheee: i bet they studied engineering

[2022-06-22T01:55:21] Unknown: That's a good point. I just happened to find it and thought it was a cool idea and different. I'm sure it has it's downfalls
[2022-06-22T04:48:04] Unknown: Have a feeling any dust or sand that might enter would also get blown right out the other side due to the high flow of air. Dunno. Thought it was a cool idea tho. Those fins are spinning so fast I'm not sure how much dirt or sand would actually makes its way into the motor 🤷🏻‍♂️. @PaoloWu do you use ferrofluid along with the motor cover holes? I have a spare set of covers I could experiment with, just not sure whether to use ferrofluid with the holes or not
[2022-06-22T08:48:49] Gigolo Joe: Update after u test it, on the paper it seems promising

[2022-06-22T18:03:32] Mirono escooters: Cuul
[2022-06-22T18:03:42] rosheee: The better display isnt available ffs
[2022-06-22T18:03:52] rosheee: That one 2 expensive foe what u get
[2022-06-22T18:04:11] rosheee: Source code is open
[2022-06-22T19:31:58] То́чка Тире́: Is sensorless less efficient? If I start motor from 1 km/h ?
[2022-06-22T19:32:54] Mirono escooters: Less torque more hassles and it switches sensorless above x rpm
[2022-06-22T19:33:58] То́чка Тире́: Less torque on start from 0 speed ?
[2022-06-22T19:37:11] rosheee: Test for airbox that pushes vescs down instead of screws
[2022-06-22T19:46:42] Mirono escooters: Yes and vibrations, because it doesnt know where magnete are
[2022-06-22T19:46:51] Mirono escooters: Always go sensored when u can. Its superior ;)
[2022-06-22T19:56:59] Unknown: Doesn't VESC have sensor to sensor less? Basically start on halls and switch to sensor less once motors are spinning a bit. I use that mode on my Nucs and really like it. Have it set to start on halls and then switch to sensor less at a very low RPM, basically the halls just get you rolling. Motors are dead silent and seem a tiny bit smoother on sensor less
[2022-06-22T20:08:00] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-06-22T20:08:21] Mirono escooters: That was my problem, 2000 erpm was too much. It couldn't keep up haha
[2022-06-22T20:08:28] Mirono escooters: Lowered switching to 1200erpm
[2022-06-22T20:09:52] Luis Magalhaes: When i was using ubox it was sensorless just a small kick push and it starts great always
[2022-06-22T20:10:32] Luis Magalhaes: If i was stoped and wanted to start just with motors sometimes it won't start 😂
[2022-06-22T20:10:56] Mirono escooters: Yea i love halls 0 speed start
[2022-06-22T20:12:11] Luis Magalhaes: Now im using halls to had yo add them to the motors, had some trouble of halls broken some how but now its running great
[2022-06-22T20:13:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: More dumb
[2022-06-22T20:33:27] Unknown: I've tried full sensor less and it almost starts from dead stop but not on incline for sure lol. I just love the smoothness of it. I think the sensor to sensorless is a great feature. Best of both 🌎s 👌
[2022-06-22T20:34:20] Кирилл: Yep
[2022-06-22T20:35:07] Кирилл: The best new feature in vesc is HFI
[2022-06-22T20:35:38] Кирилл: Doesnt need halls, so sensorless will be effective and smooth like it with halls
[2022-06-22T20:37:34] Mirono escooters: Even from startstill tho?
[2022-06-22T20:39:02] Кирилл: No matter what
[2022-06-22T20:39:32] Кирилл: Check Vedders news
[2022-06-22T20:41:37] Кирилл: Jens also implemented it in xiaomi esc poor stm with sesc😅
[2022-06-22T20:42:09] Mirono escooters: Hahahaha noo poor thing
[2022-06-22T20:42:18] Mirono escooters: They updated to the diff processor tho
[2022-06-22T20:42:37] rosheee: dude XD
[2022-06-22T20:42:45] rosheee: the airgap is 2 small
[2022-06-22T20:42:58] rosheee: also the air doesn't flow through correct cuz there is no airstream
[2022-06-22T20:43:09] rosheee: it doesn't push it
[2022-06-22T20:43:36] rosheee: hallsensor normally goes up to 2500erpm then goes sensorless
[2022-06-22T20:45:18] rosheee: but anyone tried what happens when u put hallsensor erpm to like 25'000?
[2022-06-22T20:45:22] rosheee: and then go sensorless?
[2022-06-22T20:46:14] Mirono escooters: Oempf stoxk here was 2000 and too much
[2022-06-22T20:46:24] Mirono escooters: 1200 is even too high on rapid accel i go lower more
[2022-06-22T20:46:34] rosheee: why?
[2022-06-22T20:46:38] Mirono escooters: It wont be able to follow halls and just go brbrbr like me
[2022-06-22T20:46:55] rosheee: XD
[2022-06-22T20:46:58] rosheee: flipsky?
[2022-06-22T20:47:16] rosheee: when it does rbrbrbrb problem is somewhere else
[2022-06-22T20:47:21] rosheee: i had that with all flipsky
[2022-06-22T20:48:03] Mirono escooters: Makerx
[2022-06-22T20:48:07] Mirono escooters: No
[2022-06-22T20:48:15] rosheee: no x
[2022-06-22T20:48:16] rosheee: xD
[2022-06-22T20:48:16] Mirono escooters: I lowered erpm it fixed it. I posted videos before in group
[2022-06-22T20:48:22] rosheee: ok
[2022-06-22T20:48:26] Mirono escooters: Well rbrbrbr is a term used a lot
[2022-06-22T20:48:30] Mirono escooters: It can be many bbrbrbr
[2022-06-22T20:48:34] Mirono escooters: For me, it fixed it, haha
[2022-06-22T20:48:41] rosheee: and when goes sensorless it goes away?
[2022-06-22T20:48:47] Mirono escooters: It was clear once i though about it, it always did it before switch
[2022-06-22T20:48:49] Mirono escooters: Yesh
[2022-06-22T20:48:51] rosheee: yeh
[2022-06-22T20:48:54] rosheee: same like i had
[2022-06-22T20:49:04] rosheee: can u send this
[2022-06-22T20:49:09] rosheee: holdon
[2022-06-22T20:49:29] rosheee: vesc tool starts
[2022-06-22T20:50:20] rosheee: <photos/photo_5123@22-06-2022_20-50-20.jpg>
[2022-06-22T20:50:36] rosheee: and results from hallsensors test
[2022-06-22T20:50:38] Mirono escooters: Sure in a bit
[2022-06-22T20:50:52] rosheee: if possible could u do the 1st test again?
[2022-06-22T20:51:16] rosheee: i had to calculate the shit by myself
[2022-06-22T20:51:23] rosheee: that it worked lol with fagotsky
[2022-06-22T20:51:30] Mirono escooters: For you sure 😘
[2022-06-22T20:51:34] Mirono escooters: But it works now, haha
[2022-06-22T20:51:41] rosheee: ❤️
[2022-06-22T20:51:42] rosheee: ok
[2022-06-22T20:51:47] rosheee: u set how many erpm?
[2022-06-22T20:52:35] Mirono escooters: 1200
[2022-06-22T20:52:46] Кирилл: My friend also has this problem with br brbrb lol
[2022-06-22T20:52:59] Кирилл: No faults
[2022-06-22T20:53:02] Mirono escooters: Scientifically accurate
[2022-06-22T20:53:02] Кирилл: No errors
[2022-06-22T20:53:21] Кирилл: Just brbrbrb everyday
[2022-06-22T20:53:34] rosheee: so 1300erpm are like 3-4kmh
[2022-06-22T20:53:37] rosheee: on my scooter
[2022-06-22T20:54:14] Mirono escooters: Idk. I just know it works ☻️☻️
[2022-06-22T20:54:15] Кирилл: Also flipsky
[2022-06-22T20:54:22] Кирилл: Ubox no problems at all
[2022-06-22T20:54:23] Кирилл: Never
[2022-06-22T20:54:24] rosheee: no rbbrbr vrom 0kmh
[2022-06-22T20:54:27] rosheee: word
[2022-06-22T20:54:39] rosheee: i rly had that issue..i was going crazy
[2022-06-22T20:55:05] rosheee: then changed the values here for inductance flxu and ind. difference
[2022-06-22T20:55:17] rosheee: when put sensorless ir worked
[2022-06-22T20:55:26] rosheee: then flipsky exploded cuz set 300A XD
[2022-06-22T20:56:12] rosheee: and i ahd 0 torque then and rrbrbrbbr
[2022-06-22T20:56:47] rosheee: it measured/calculated the parameters wrong cuz it is/was retarded
[2022-06-22T20:56:54] Кирилл: I did setup with settings you write to me for him, not ubox one. Ubox is working good. For flipsky one. Brbrbr on start until ~10 km/h
[2022-06-22T20:57:02] Кирилл: Even wuth fucking 30A phase
[2022-06-22T20:57:09] Кирилл: And 10A battery
[2022-06-22T20:57:13] rosheee: yes ofc
[2022-06-22T20:57:15] sombre_enfant: 75100 ?
[2022-06-22T20:57:22] rosheee: cuz the values there are wrong
[2022-06-22T20:57:24] rosheee: here
[2022-06-22T20:57:32] rosheee: and also hallsensor parameters
[2022-06-22T20:57:43] Кирилл: He has no halls
[2022-06-22T20:57:48] Кирилл: And 5.1 firmware
[2022-06-22T20:57:51] rosheee: then parametes
[2022-06-22T20:58:32] Кирилл: Need to make x10 motor wizards?
[2022-06-22T20:58:57] Unknown: I have my sensor to sensorless set to switch at like 5mph or so. Really super slow, works perfectly. Literally use halls (sensors) to get the tires rolling and then switch to sensorless. I assume the logic is similar on VESC, same idea
[2022-06-22T21:02:22] Mirono escooters: No, sensors work fine.. zero start feels good
[2022-06-22T21:03:57] rosheee: ^^' same
[2022-06-22T21:04:02] rosheee: x10?
[2022-06-22T21:04:50] Кирилл: Ye, 10 times?
[2022-06-22T21:05:04] Кирилл: Or manually write here?
[2022-06-22T21:05:19] rosheee: i done it like this
[2022-06-22T21:05:26] rosheee: XD it was the worst i had bladers on arm
[2022-06-22T21:05:28] rosheee: sry hadn
[2022-06-22T21:05:29] rosheee: hand
[2022-06-22T21:05:36] rosheee: there is also nearly no torque
[2022-06-22T21:06:20] rosheee: so i connected laptop XD then changed values there and holded the rear wheel i've done that until it had torque and i couldn't hold wheel
[2022-06-22T21:06:34] rosheee: then i told my friend about that ^^' and he calculated and measured the parameters
[2022-06-22T21:07:36] rosheee: after doing test for like 10-20times u take the average of all them
[2022-06-22T21:08:01] rosheee: that is also some nasty thang to calculate xD
[2022-06-22T21:08:07] rosheee: or he can burn that shit controller down and buy my ubox v1 75V
[2022-06-22T21:09:02] rosheee: ah and after setted new values i watched DATA ANALYSIS -> REALTIME DATA -> CURRENT
[2022-06-22T21:09:17] rosheee: it was weeks of work
[2022-06-22T21:09:40] rosheee: then fucking throttle filter didn't worked and all 0.5-2 sec it accelerated for 0.5sec by itself lol
[2022-06-22T21:18:33] Кирилл: Nah, he put his soul and all his money into flopsky. Now he dont want to do anything but to ride on it like it is
[2022-06-22T21:20:49] rosheee: yah then
[2022-06-22T21:20:55] rosheee: send the measurements
[2022-06-22T21:21:14] rosheee: if sensorlesss is also grgrrg then values are wrong measured
[2022-06-22T21:21:17] rosheee: then good luck
[2022-06-22T21:22:04] rosheee: u also can check sample data unter data analysis and the look there how the data is
[2022-06-22T21:22:35] rosheee: or can try BLDC if he has
[2022-06-22T21:23:10] Кирилл: Ok
[2022-06-22T21:28:35] rosheee: Ehhehe
[2022-06-22T21:28:42] rosheee: This cable good for phase?

[2022-06-22T22:45:21] Tommy: sometimes 11.9 or similar👹
[2022-06-22T22:45:35] sombre_enfant: How much internal in 40t?
[2022-06-22T22:46:10] Tommy: i remember something about 7

[2022-06-22T22:47:09] Кирилл: 8-9 AC 1khz
[2022-06-22T22:48:59] gil guy: yes .but this internal resistance is not representative . I know this multimeter . it's AC value , measured a high frequency . for us need to measure in with a Opus BT-3100 or an 1A constant current power supply by measuring voltage drop ..
[2022-06-22T22:49:49] Konstantin: Opus peace of shit

[2022-06-23T00:17:25] Mirono escooters: Cool technology
[2022-06-23T00:17:40] Кирилл: Its new, no tests on road yet i think
[2022-06-23T01:04:17] Artem Bulashev: Awesome
[2022-06-23T01:04:28] Artem Bulashev: How it won’t be burning Ubox
[2022-06-23T01:04:55] Artem Bulashev: Onside ring Ubox is officially added to the directory now Vesctool

[2022-06-23T15:32:15] Artem Bulashev: Guys can you f stop with those
[2022-06-23T15:32:29] Artem Bulashev: Impossible to read chat because
[2022-06-23T15:40:51] Mirono escooters: +1
[2022-06-23T15:48:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1 please: 1/ reply with specific user name when you really reply to someone 2/ stop all garbaged gifs ... with 100 people on the group, it becomes impossible to read 3/ avoid acronyms and talk in english everybody can understand 4/ focus on vesc talks... no battery, brakes, other controllers or whatever
[2022-06-23T15:55:15] Artem Bulashev: That is why I have gifs off in all my groups 😁😁
[2022-06-23T15:55:43] Artem Bulashev: In Russian vesc not even Single smile is allowed - clutters the chat too much
[2022-06-23T15:55:47] Artem Bulashev: 😊
[2022-06-23T15:55:51] Artem Bulashev: 😊😊
[2022-06-23T15:55:55] Artem Bulashev: Like that, every one must put double smile for sake of clean chat
[2022-06-23T15:56:08] Mirono escooters: I dont speak suka blyat :(
[2022-06-23T15:56:41] Mirono escooters: But i support that. At morning, instead of reading newspaper i usually read vesc chat Then i see 700msg😢
[2022-06-23T15:56:47] Artem Bulashev: Yeah unfortunately it is not in most common language chat :)
[2022-06-23T15:56:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not a bad thing...
[2022-06-23T15:57:32] Mirono escooters: Stickers are fun, just not same cat emoyji spam 69 times
[2022-06-23T15:58:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: completed with point 4
[2022-06-23T16:00:26] Artem Bulashev: Yeah that is why I added battery / chat room, as it was over taking other chat rooms off topic way too often, not just this vesc but vsett group as well
[2022-06-23T16:08:29] rosheee: Better than news
[2022-06-23T16:09:06] rosheee: It is all my fault @artBula @koxx3
[2022-06-23T16:15:48] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't start with emojis and stickers and gifs ban
[2022-06-23T16:27:44] Artem Bulashev: No on speaks of ban, but let’s keep it reasonable and just not go over board on those
[2022-06-23T16:28:30] Artem Bulashev: From my experience people can’t control it. So I don’t have them enabled from default as I know those groups will be thousands of people in short time
[2022-06-23T16:49:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Mostly i agree , some topics can be related still to vesc The more we see the more we know ,but main topic is VESC
[2022-06-23T18:12:13] sombre_enfant: Should i have two device here ?
[2022-06-23T18:12:57] Кирилл: If dual - yes

[2022-06-23T18:18:39] sombre_enfant: So did i kill the shit
[2022-06-23T18:18:57] Paolo ⁭: Because rx means “receive” (I think and tx means “transmit”
[2022-06-23T18:19:08] Кирилл: Yep
[2022-06-23T18:19:11] Paolo ⁭: So if one wire transmit and another receive

[2022-06-23T18:27:48] Кирилл: You dont need to connect anything between escs outside
[2022-06-23T18:28:00] Кирилл: Just from computer to one of two usb of ubox and thats all
[2022-06-23T18:29:07] Кирилл: Rx, tx, gnd, 5v are for st link

[2022-06-23T18:47:15] Paolo ⁭: did you inverted now?
[2022-06-23T18:53:12] sombre_enfant: No i have no soldering gear i left everything at shop... Can i ride with only master ? What should i disconnect from slave till i fix this ?
[2022-06-23T18:57:33] Gigolo Joe: That's why they all grumpy all the time
[2022-06-23T18:59:30] Gigolo Joe: Can cable and battery
[2022-06-23T19:00:27] sombre_enfant: Can keep motor phase and hall ?
[2022-06-23T19:01:06] Gigolo Joe: Shouldn't be a problem, but for extra safety just disconnect everything
[2022-06-23T19:01:18] sombre_enfant: Aight
[2022-06-23T19:03:50] sombre_enfant: Next time i dont follow random video💀

[2022-06-23T21:35:37] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: good idea
[2022-06-23T21:37:16] francois schempers: I would add, you can talk about scooter info, like battery, motors, etc as soon as its relevant and/or you need help, we have a lots of experts here so sharing is caring, I'm not forbidding talking about anything else, but don't throw yourself into a 50 msg convo with someone, as an example, here I share about my electric moto project, few pics, few responses and that was it, then I talk with some in private. do the same
[2022-06-23T21:43:37] Face de Pin Sucé: VESC > All

[2022-06-23T23:00:24] Mirono escooters: Indeed
[2022-06-23T23:01:04] rosheee: ok
[2022-06-23T23:07:44] Face de Pin Sucé: Hahaha I can ask by myself 🥰
[2022-06-23T23:52:45] rosheee: lol
[2022-06-24T18:37:32] Mirono escooters: Thats not a scooter

[2022-06-24T18:37:57] Mirono escooters: Stainless steel wire+ thermal tape
[2022-06-24T18:38:00] Mirono escooters: 4 rows of wire
[2022-06-24T18:42:01] Martin Kaktits: how much power u need? yes
[2022-06-24T18:42:40] Mirono escooters: 1500w motor looking at this like
[2022-06-24T18:42:42] Mirono escooters: <animation>
[2022-06-24T18:43:14] Mirono escooters: Now the big question. Does it work?
[2022-06-24T18:46:05] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_5153@24-06-2022_18-46-05.jpg>
[2022-06-24T18:46:14] Paolo ⁭: let’s do it
[2022-06-24T18:46:36] Mirono escooters: It looks beautiful.. i did it before
[2022-06-24T18:54:12] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_5154@24-06-2022_18-54-12.jpg>
[2022-06-24T19:03:35] Paolo ⁭: Seems just wrapping
[2022-06-24T19:16:24] Mirono escooters: Yes. Only wrap
[2022-06-24T19:16:45] Mirono escooters: Not as overkill as you, i thought you were talking about looks :)
[2022-06-24T19:18:05] Paolo ⁭: <video_file>
[2022-06-24T19:18:06] Paolo ⁭: This is solid carbon
[2022-06-24T19:33:23] sombre_enfant: U bought whole happy scooter
[2022-06-24T20:06:23] Mirono escooters: Yesnt On picture isnt his But i did buy it. Haha
[2022-06-24T20:11:21] То́чка Тире́: @PaoloWu you will save folding mechanism ? How you will fit round tube on complex oval of the steering wheel ?
[2022-06-24T20:11:51] Gigolo Joe: All of it
[2022-06-24T21:08:50] sombre_enfant: U sure on that ? I get bad reading by that, its impossible to do 80kph on 13s on road...
[2022-06-24T21:43:52] Mirono escooters: The heatsink defenitely work😱 15 min ride until vesc 80* lmao
[2022-06-24T21:44:33] Mirono escooters: Not very scientific , but heatsinks are defenitely warm! Motor cover is less hot then before. Succeess😀
[2022-06-24T21:44:56] Mirono escooters: Now borrow heatcamera and vesc heatsink.. xd. 75* jump to 82 lmao
[2022-06-24T21:45:11] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-06-24T21:45:14] Unknown: Damn, really huh? Thermal paste and steel wire?
[2022-06-24T21:45:27] Mirono escooters: Thermal tape. And 4 rows of wire
[2022-06-24T21:45:37] Unknown: What size heatsinks did you use? Notice any off balance or vibrations?
[2022-06-24T21:45:45] Unknown: Ahh, gotcha
[2022-06-24T21:45:48] Mirono escooters: I twisted and twisted until i couldnt with a plier. Then i secured it
[2022-06-24T21:46:04] Mirono escooters: I feel nothing differently
[2022-06-24T21:46:13] Unknown: Awesome man
[2022-06-24T21:46:19] Mirono escooters: I made sure all heatsink same space, same amount..

[2022-06-24T21:46:28] Mirono escooters: <video_file>
[2022-06-24T21:47:15] Mirono escooters: The heatsink w3re better 90* turned. But then the wire was loose Now. Godfit? The diameter of wire was same as space between heatsinks. No movement. Little l3ss efficient but that's nothing
[2022-06-24T21:47:32] Unknown: Rode last night and rear motor was 52C and front motor was 42C at the windings ( not hot, just comparing front to rear temps). Rear motor definitely take the brunt of the load
[2022-06-24T21:47:42] Mirono escooters: Thats so cold haha
[2022-06-24T21:48:36] Mirono escooters: Im happy, haha. 30€ and it defenitely works. More test needed. But its defenitely warm. Not as warm as motor, but defenitely taking some of the heat 😱
[2022-06-24T21:48:43] Unknown: It was around 65F ambient so not warm at all
[2022-06-24T21:49:10] Mirono escooters: Lovely
[2022-06-24T21:49:17] Mirono escooters: Those motors take alot
[2022-06-24T21:49:19] Unknown: Yea man, I mean that's essentially what the grin hubsinks are... Definitely a little more refined and slightly larger fins but same general idea
[2022-06-24T21:49:22] sombre_enfant: 65???
[2022-06-24T21:50:31] Unknown: 18C ... 65F lol
[2022-06-24T21:50:50] Mirono escooters: Well this is 1/5 the price😱
[2022-06-24T21:50:51] Unknown: Wonderful imperial system here
[2022-06-24T21:50:59] Unknown: Yup no doubt
[2022-06-24T21:51:06] Mirono escooters: Good for me!
[2022-06-24T21:51:13] Mirono escooters: Ill do more scientific tests😂
[2022-06-24T21:51:55] Happy Giraffe: Turbinator better than hubsink
[2022-06-24T21:52:06] Unknown: LoL. Nice job man. Looks pretty legit to me 😅
[2022-06-24T21:52:44] Unknown: What size were the sinks you used? Those small PC heatsinks?
[2022-06-24T21:53:04] Mirono escooters: Yea and more expensive ☻️☻️☻️
[2022-06-24T21:53:06] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-06-24T21:53:18] Mirono escooters: Not too small, i couldnt fit much wider. It is already close to the spokes
[2022-06-24T21:53:30] Unknown: I can fit a small ring of them around my 10+ motors on the opposite side of the rotor
[2022-06-24T21:53:58] Unknown: Maybe worth a shot. Easy enough to remove if they don't work or throw shit off balance
[2022-06-24T21:54:09] Unknown: The metal wire is a good touch 👍
[2022-06-24T21:55:03] Unknown: I have double sided thermal tape too, really thin should work good and not permanent like paste. Easily removable
[2022-06-24T21:55:14] Mirono escooters: Without it, it will fly off
[2022-06-24T21:55:21] Mirono escooters: My thought
[2022-06-24T21:55:28] Mirono escooters: And adjustable as u need to line em up good
[2022-06-24T21:55:29] Unknown: Yup would lol
[2022-06-24T21:56:03] Unknown: Ok, you got me sold. Going to measure my space tonight and order the largest ones I can fit 🙈
[2022-06-24T21:56:06] Mirono escooters: Chrck thr video, it doesnt movr anything
[2022-06-24T21:56:31] Unknown: Inexpensive enough to experiment
[2022-06-24T21:56:35] Mirono escooters: The tip is!! If u do 4 pairs like me, do at 4 points 90* offset, not tighten the wire at 4 same places.. ;)
[2022-06-24T21:56:47] Mirono escooters: It really works. I think a good mod after ferrofluid
[2022-06-24T21:57:03] Mirono escooters: This is from the endless sphere. Not my own idea. :)
[2022-06-24T21:57:08] Unknown: Ahh, good idea. Wires will tighten evenly
[2022-06-24T21:57:14] Happy Giraffe: If your motors wind heats max 60 you don't really need them, just adds drag🌚
[2022-06-24T21:57:36] Happy Giraffe: You could try custom side cover cnc😳
[2022-06-24T21:57:41] Mirono escooters: Yes, where u tighten u always have a dead spot, so these are loose. So at 90* offset u ensure max tighteness
[2022-06-24T21:57:49] Mirono escooters: But but it look cool🥺
[2022-06-24T21:58:59] Happy Giraffe: Larger conducting area on side cover sitting bit closer to winding should help too🤔
[2022-06-24T21:59:14] Happy Giraffe: Just like BearEbike did on their 20,000w 205
[2022-06-24T21:59:21] Mirono escooters: Yea but side cover good luck tightening that
[2022-06-24T21:59:24] Mirono escooters: Need custom design
[2022-06-24T22:00:13] Happy Giraffe: Ofc, but yeah could sell cover then😁
[2022-06-24T22:00:29] Mirono escooters: Im not that overkill
[2022-06-24T22:00:33] Mirono escooters: Would prob cost a good motor. Lol
[2022-06-24T22:00:41] Mirono escooters: And this works. Im very very happy☻️
[2022-06-24T22:01:17] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, for you it's needed but maybe Adam at 60°c might not benefit from them in reality🤔
[2022-06-24T22:01:42] Mirono escooters: Yea haha problably not
[2022-06-24T22:01:49] Mirono escooters: Unless he wants *moreee powaa*
[2022-06-24T22:02:05] Mirono escooters: <animation>
[2022-06-24T22:07:31] rosheee: 60C?
[2022-06-24T22:07:37] rosheee: How fast u rode?
[2022-06-24T22:07:46] rosheee: Btw took data@adam?
[2022-06-24T23:04:13] Unknown: They have gotten a bit hotter in warmer weather... I've seen 185-190F max so far (85-87C) at the windings. Still not dangerously hot but in the dead of summer they will likely be over 90C riding like a maniac
[2022-06-24T23:10:54] sombre_enfant: It stay cool
[2022-06-24T23:12:06] Mirono escooters: Me with 80..
[2022-06-24T23:14:00] Artem Bulashev: 87 with ferrofluid?
[2022-06-24T23:14:27] Artem Bulashev: that is about as high as you want motor to get with FF
[2022-06-24T23:14:45] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_5162@24-06-2022_23-14-45.jpg>
[2022-06-24T23:14:45] Artem Bulashev: because magnets than are aroud 80-83c
[2022-06-24T23:56:59] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, need a custom side cover then😁
[2022-06-25T00:50:06] rosheee: U recorded data?
[2022-06-25T01:05:22] rosheee: Lol
[2022-06-25T01:05:37] rosheee: Why scooter cables are ...

[2022-06-25T01:06:53] rosheee: And dis copper?
[2022-06-25T02:00:31] Luis Magalhaes: tinned copper i think
[2022-06-25T02:30:12] Artem Bulashev: Correct tinned copper to reduce oxidation
[2022-06-25T03:00:08] rosheee: Thsnks

[2022-06-25T03:01:57] Unknown: You probably want way more insulation stripped off your wires and then twist them around the copper winding leads.
[2022-06-25T03:02:18] rosheee: XD more?

[2022-06-25T03:02:40] rosheee: 3cm
[2022-06-25T03:03:14] rosheee: Did u took of the insulation?
[2022-06-25T03:03:17] rosheee: From the copper
[2022-06-25T03:06:17] Unknown: Yes you need to burn the tips or use a metal wire wheel on a Dremel to take off the lamination on the phase leads... Just where you plan on soldering your new wires to it. If laminations Aren't removed solder with never stick
[2022-06-25T03:07:13] Unknown: Use a torch, metal wire wheel or even sandpaper to take the lamination off the copper wire tips ONLY. FYI, you cannot see the "lamination" it's a very thin layer that costs the copper
[2022-06-25T03:09:52] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-06-25T03:09:58] rosheee: Like last time

[2022-06-25T10:16:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You can buy that ring on nexun
[2022-06-25T10:19:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Damn good but that piece is like 250euro
[2022-06-25T11:04:16] Mirono escooters: Ö
[2022-06-25T11:04:20] Mirono escooters: Oh well i diyed it
[2022-06-25T11:49:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Afterwards i realized
[2022-06-25T11:51:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There is few brands making it, Its usally a part of a circle and you buy the amount for the diameter you need
[2022-06-25T11:52:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You can join them together and this way fits different sized engine's, I seen this even on Inokim style hub engine
[2022-06-25T11:52:26] Mirono escooters: Yea i saw that. But the ones i saw were over 100€ :))
[2022-06-25T11:54:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I dont remember prices , i remember you could find it on nexun site or other where you find ferrofluid was some grin tech ring or similar name the other i saw was shown by Happy
[2022-06-25T11:55:21] Mirono escooters: Yep but expensive
[2022-06-25T11:55:34] Mirono escooters: Then i saw endlesssphere thing
[2022-06-25T11:56:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I think they have the ring also
[2022-06-25T11:56:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Near that i dunno how much you spend on heatsinks .,wire and time fixing them
[2022-06-25T11:57:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also if they come bit loose you will sound like santa's sled
[2022-06-25T11:58:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well, things above average is not cheap 😅
[2022-06-25T12:00:04] Mirono escooters: Im sure it wont come loose. 4 rows of stainless steel wire twisted to smitherines and glied
[2022-06-25T12:00:13] Mirono escooters: Approx 30
[2022-06-25T12:00:20] Mirono escooters: Vs 100+ship+ taxes
[2022-06-25T12:00:44] Mirono escooters: I wont spend 150 on some heatsinks, then i can just get a better motor, poor 1500w loo
[2022-06-25T12:17:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: All engine's heat up🤷‍♂
[2022-06-25T12:17:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If we Would not feed them as there is no tomorrow we would not have a problem
[2022-06-25T12:18:32] Mirono escooters: I want my power ;)
[2022-06-25T12:19:02] Mirono escooters: But there are with physical larger margnets and cooling area. :)
[2022-06-25T12:19:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Diy is ok in untested long time for our self ,but cant give this to a customer
[2022-06-25T12:19:20] Mirono escooters: My point is, diy works, maybe not as good as the expensive shit but for me, top
[2022-06-25T12:19:27] Mirono escooters: Im not..
[2022-06-25T12:19:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I didn't say you do just saying
[2022-06-25T12:21:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Kinda same thing is that i dont do same cfw and setup for other ppl what i have ,i know how to treat it ,but overpowered and if you dont keep an eye out ,you eat the Engine like hell
[2022-06-25T12:24:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In 2 -3 seconds i can gain + 8-10c° in the engine And while you discharge to the moon you are not really able to transfer the amount of heat what you would like
[2022-06-25T12:24:29] Mirono escooters: Yea full throttle my vesc temp rises quick lol
[2022-06-25T12:26:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I have temp sensor in xiaomi Engine with moded std contoller with an extra monocrom screen
[2022-06-25T12:26:22] Mirono escooters: O temp sensor
[2022-06-25T12:26:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not just in vesc
[2022-06-25T12:27:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah i now make some experiments with ,fluids - oils Wind mills , milled caps with removed paint and such 😁
[2022-06-25T12:30:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But with xiaomi you could even put that temp on main screen
[2022-06-25T13:02:30] sombre_enfant: How i can remove limited mode ?
[2022-06-25T13:05:52] Happy Giraffe: Do you guys know if there's a possibility to add 10 second boost current for Vesc and then back to nominal amps?
[2022-06-25T13:39:27] rosheee: Per code
[2022-06-25T14:19:05] Happy Giraffe: Dang, just was looking for easy way to do it
[2022-06-25T14:20:03] Mirono escooters: Woule b cool
[2022-06-25T14:20:05] Mirono escooters: Turbo button
[2022-06-25T15:17:56] Happy Giraffe: Noo, but a software feature
[2022-06-25T15:18:47] Happy Giraffe: So even in "legal" mode I would have 750w instead of 250w. And after 10 secs it would go down to 250w until I slowed down again
[2022-06-25T16:28:56] rosheee: It is
[2022-06-25T16:28:58] rosheee: Aha
[2022-06-25T16:29:12] rosheee: But wjat u do when they stop u?
[2022-06-25T16:29:14] rosheee: Measure
[2022-06-25T16:29:54] rosheee: U could use small sensor somewhere
[2022-06-25T16:36:09] Happy Giraffe: I didnt understand fully what you meant
[2022-06-25T16:36:41] Happy Giraffe: I turn vesc off and reboot so it changes to 250w profile, I would still want it to do 750w peak tho
[2022-06-25T16:36:54] Happy Giraffe: First 3 seconds atleast
[2022-06-25T17:40:12] francois schempers: there is a boost button on the new spintend adc board, maybe you can wire that to temporary apply a profile or just apply added % of maximum current
[2022-06-25T17:43:23] francois schempers: <photos/photo_5171@25-06-2022_17-43-23.jpg>
[2022-06-25T17:44:25] francois schempers: you use a push button to alternate between high speed and low speed
[2022-06-25T17:45:12] rosheee: Xactly
[2022-06-25T17:45:31] rosheee: U could also use ur musclepowa
[2022-06-25T17:46:25] francois schempers: I would break the controller due to big surge in regen current
[2022-06-25T17:54:25] Happy Giraffe: If it can apply 200% current for 3 sec it would be fantastic, however to get that properly working will be bit tricky
[2022-06-25T18:05:09] rosheee: ok
[2022-06-25T18:05:13] rosheee: tell me exactly when u want that
[2022-06-25T18:44:46] Happy Giraffe: If I show down on bike and then accelerate again a 3 sec boost would be nice
[2022-06-25T18:45:16] Happy Giraffe: That would be similar to legal bikes with 250w motors which use 750w ish peak power instead🤔
[2022-06-25T19:20:30] Gigolo Joe: Why? Been told by local builders no problem going upto 100⁰c with ff
[2022-06-25T19:21:25] Mirono escooters: Magnets above 80* dont like it
[2022-06-25T19:24:21] Gigolo Joe: Any source on that?
[2022-06-25T19:25:48] Mirono escooters: The max temp of *most* neodymium magnets
[2022-06-25T19:26:07] Mirono escooters: Some can be higher. But 80 is just universal
[2022-06-25T19:50:29] Happy Giraffe: Efficiency gets lost as it goes hotter, also without ferrofluid magnet heats slower I think🤔 If you add ferro then the thermal transfer goes more to magnets so have to be even more careful.

[2022-06-26T16:06:17] rosheee: Not possible atm
[2022-06-26T16:06:30] sombre_enfant: Right assembly
[2022-06-26T16:06:33] rosheee: I have to chnge the stempole
[2022-06-26T16:06:44] rosheee: Where?
[2022-06-26T17:00:52] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-06-26T17:01:20] Jan: Rip disc
[2022-06-26T20:06:40] Mirono escooters: Gg
[2022-06-26T20:06:49] Mirono escooters: How
[2022-06-27T00:32:11] Happy Giraffe: Spintend is making single v2 soon for 20s
[2022-06-27T00:33:03] Happy Giraffe: Current single is ok for 60/120A usage without cooling. You can add a fan on the topside where mosfet is located or bolt it upside down for thermal transfer to scooter/bike
[2022-06-27T00:33:38] Happy Giraffe: With lets say a Noctua fan you might be able to push it 80A battery 130A phase
[2022-06-27T00:35:01] Happy Giraffe: I used 60A batt 120A phase no issues without cooling, I changed thermal pads to achieve it tho. In addition if you put fan or bolt it upside down with thermal paste you get better results
[2022-06-27T00:35:17] Happy Giraffe: All depends what motor you need to run and how far you stress it
[2022-06-27T00:36:18] Happy Giraffe: So a single motor only setup?🤔
[2022-06-27T00:37:18] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, some others dont like them but worked fine for me. Stock pads were worn out a bit and made bad contact. Thermal grizzly pads I used two thicknesses as the mosfets on single v1 are not on same level🌚
[2022-06-27T00:39:07] Happy Giraffe: Vsett 10+ motor is bit higher kv so they like lot of amps but if you don't do insane hill climbing or 80kmh high speed riding it will be ok. However if you want yo ride fast for long time then you need a thermal sensor in motor and beefier vesc
[2022-06-27T00:39:47] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, case is designed badly and mosfets are 0.5mm on different level so heatsink doesnt have even pressure which is critical😁
[2022-06-27T00:40:02] Happy Giraffe: Not but others here have like @Ghost_911
[2022-06-27T00:42:54] Happy Giraffe: Yes, spintend has antispark and button integrated. Bluetooth also easy to add
[2022-06-27T00:43:20] Happy Giraffe: But for pushing a single motor hard it might be on its limits
[2022-06-27T00:54:54] rosheee: 90a battery and 250A phase
[2022-06-27T01:03:21] sombre_enfant: Got 40/90 too i rided for 20min yet with it and dont noticied going over 40 celcius
[2022-06-27T01:09:12] Happy Giraffe: Yes, it was bolted from other side so no thermal transfer
[2022-06-27T01:23:25] Unknown: Vsett motor will overheat using 90a batt and 250a phase. I run mine on 80/225 with ferrofluid and have seen 85C at the windings with not super hot ambient temp
[2022-06-27T01:24:20] Unknown: For a burst here and there it probably handle it but not constantly riding around with those settings. 90/250 was run without motor temp sensor so no idea how hot the windings and magnets were
[2022-06-27T01:25:29] Unknown: Yup will handle that no problem 👍
[2022-06-27T01:26:11] Unknown: My Front motor is at 75/140 and stays about 10-15C cooler than the rear... But it also isn't working as hard
[2022-06-27T01:29:26] Happy Giraffe: Especially with only one motor it will overheat much quicker😅
[2022-06-27T01:29:54] Happy Giraffe: Dual motor shares the load, one motor will cook much faster
[2022-06-27T01:35:06] Happy Giraffe: Kelly
[2022-06-27T01:46:12] rosheee: Yah, 75/135 is going like crazy.
[2022-06-27T01:46:34] rosheee: Motor also fewls not rly good at 250A xD
[2022-06-27T02:06:46] Unknown: Well it also depends what voltage. I run those amps on 20s. 72v nominal X 80a batt = 5760watts. 5760watts on 60v nominal would need 96a battery
[2022-06-27T10:16:59] rosheee: Yey
[2022-06-27T10:17:03] rosheee: Peak battery 200A
[2022-06-27T11:07:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: They made it like an idiot, heatsink area on top, so no heatbridge on body and inside mosfets sit on the otherside so not even heatbridge to its case😅
[2022-06-27T11:08:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe if you change pads ,vut housing and install it upside down better cooling
[2022-06-27T11:09:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Filip is good in heat just get her our from crap box and mount properly, i would beat that idiot who makes these boxes

[2022-06-27T11:10:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like they make the most crap alloy box than put mosfets to side and mount by bottom🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
[2022-06-27T12:18:52] Happy Giraffe: And have perfectly flat bottom for great thermal paste cooling😂
[2022-06-27T12:19:16] Happy Giraffe: Should have esc slide from side just like all other chinese

[2022-06-28T13:10:12] Mirono escooters: :*(
[2022-06-28T13:10:42] Mirono escooters: They didnt even care to answer me how i can buy them in eu, lol. Ill keep with diy
[2022-06-28T13:11:22] Mirono escooters: I wonder. Sideways fins? Would that even work efficiently Mine have front smaller fins, and at side larger. Idk how air flows, but Sideways seems weird.
[2022-06-28T13:11:34] Happy Giraffe: Wtf, turbinators.com

[2022-06-28T13:16:40] Mirono escooters: Im not paying 120€ + shipping from us+ bpost taxes fucking me
[2022-06-28T13:16:51] Mirono escooters: Thats 200€ for those 5 chunks of metal with fins :))
[2022-06-28T13:18:01] Mirono escooters: Anyway diy works im happy. I will borrow thermal cam
[2022-06-28T14:09:13] Happy Giraffe: If they are making it in Poland then why would they ship it from US?🤔
[2022-06-28T14:09:28] Mirono escooters: Oh, then i confuse it with different cooling thing
[2022-06-28T14:09:37] Happy Giraffe: Atm can't proceed as sold out
[2022-06-28T14:09:37] Mirono escooters: There are multiple 🙈

[2022-06-28T14:38:37] Mirono escooters: Cant wait for new products
[2022-06-28T14:41:24] Happy Giraffe: Maybe throttle or single v2
[2022-06-28T14:41:49] Mirono escooters: I hope for both
[2022-06-28T15:07:00] Artem Bulashev: Throttle is coming
[2022-06-28T15:07:17] Artem Bulashev: Full cnc
[2022-06-28T15:07:56] Artem Bulashev: Unbelievably how low price we were able to make it with all those extra features!
[2022-06-28T15:08:01] Mirono escooters: Yesyesyes
[2022-06-28T15:08:47] Artem Bulashev: We are looking at 59$ for throttle and 17$ for top buttons module pre sale
[2022-06-28T15:09:04] Mirono escooters: Im in
[2022-06-28T15:09:24] Artem Bulashev: Which is 69$ 20$ for standard price than 💪
[2022-06-28T15:09:49] Artem Bulashev: May be we will even keep pre sale price as final, if we can manage
[2022-06-28T15:10:13] Artem Bulashev: 1 July public info but I keep you posted
[2022-06-28T15:10:46] Artem Bulashev: PCB design is being tested and FW being written now for it - we have MCU inside throttle
[2022-06-28T15:22:18] rosheee: Aliexpress

[2022-06-28T18:57:12] Mirono escooters: Or worse case use a switch to swigch etween Bluetooth and throtgl
[2022-06-28T18:59:39] Happy Giraffe: If vesc had profile to disable throttle function of two-way throttle I would be golden with police
[2022-06-28T19:00:03] Happy Giraffe: Throttle on my illegal mode and only ebrake on legal mode
[2022-06-28T19:00:40] Mirono escooters: Haha that would b sick
[2022-06-28T19:00:46] Happy Giraffe: Would be a really unique feature
[2022-06-28T19:00:52] Mirono escooters: Yea
[2022-06-28T19:01:01] Happy Giraffe: Police cant say anything as its a brake

[2022-06-28T23:17:08] Artem Bulashev: Still can
[2022-06-28T23:17:16] Artem Bulashev: Mcu is used for internal routing
[2022-06-28T23:17:33] Artem Bulashev: Communication output is is adc
[2022-06-28T23:17:38] Artem Bulashev: But it is managed by mcu
[2022-06-28T23:17:47] Artem Bulashev: So we have 3 outputs
[2022-06-28T23:18:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lol
[2022-06-28T23:19:20] rosheee: ok
[2022-06-28T23:23:24] Artem Bulashev: 1. 3.3v adc bi-directional for programmable controllers 2. 5v mid to max scaled as 0-100% adc for normall controller 3. E-Brake line engager - when you scroll back over 20% seperetae line will close circuits - you connect ebrake here and it will close it to ground. So normal controllers can also use wheel to e-brake. Strength of ebrake is set by original display as before. Than also there is a input for cruise control button, it also has external input wire 🙂💪
[2022-06-28T23:26:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: did you try the 3.3v bidirection with a powerful vesc ? we had many issues with such configuration. too much noise. vesc was going crazy 😔
[2022-06-28T23:28:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: phase wires and even vesc pcb seems to bring too much noise on adc input above 100a phase.
[2022-06-28T23:28:45] Artem Bulashev: So far no issues on first test samples by Spintend them self
[2022-06-28T23:28:50] Artem Bulashev: But will see
[2022-06-28T23:29:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: do you remap to a real 0-3.3v ?
[2022-06-28T23:29:47] Artem Bulashev: Spintend handle electronics
[2022-06-28T23:29:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if yes, it could be ok.
[2022-06-28T23:30:15] Artem Bulashev: I do design and operational mechanics :)
[2022-06-28T23:30:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok. we'll see then
[2022-06-28T23:30:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but even with 0-3.3v, we had issues unless using a shielded cable.
[2022-06-28T23:31:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: just a small warning 😉
[2022-06-28T23:32:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you really need to try it with high phases currents
[2022-06-28T23:32:41] Paolo ⁭: I really want to know how you people like this throttle 🥲
[2022-06-28T23:33:02] Paolo ⁭: Still like thumb throttle
[2022-06-28T23:35:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's another world 😉
[2022-06-28T23:35:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: seriously, having electric brake under the thumb is really awesome
[2022-06-28T23:36:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 99% of my brakes are electric now.
[2022-06-28T23:36:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i can even drift with electric brakes 🤣🤣
[2022-06-28T23:38:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no more brake pads to replace, battery goes up at each brake (like any advanced electric vehicule), much smoother brake.
[2022-06-28T23:38:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: mecanichal brake is only here in emergency cases.
[2022-06-28T23:38:52] rosheee: video or it didn't happen and free display for all
[2022-06-28T23:39:42] Artem Bulashev: Agree
[2022-06-28T23:39:48] Artem Bulashev: I stoped using my mech brake
[2022-06-28T23:40:13] Artem Bulashev: It is just next level, unless you buy Rion
[2022-06-28T23:40:20] Paolo ⁭: Even I don’t like electronic brake. I always disable it. But yes I should try something better
[2022-06-28T23:40:29] Artem Bulashev: Because that shit is just pain for fingers
[2022-06-28T23:40:38] rosheee: lol? pain for fingers xD?
[2022-06-28T23:40:49] Artem Bulashev: It’s toooo low
[2022-06-28T23:41:19] Artem Bulashev: For some fuckin reason parallel to steering and up close to you 🙆‍♂️
[2022-06-28T23:41:29] Artem Bulashev: Who ever designed it was a compete damm fuck
[2022-06-28T23:41:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i tried rion throttle, it was aweful. i don't know if this unit had an issue, but it wasn't smooth at all. the thumb wheel could even lock and not return a neutral position 🙈
[2022-06-28T23:42:54] Artem Bulashev: 😄😄 no idea how they can mess up basic electronic device with one electric component (in their case) THAT BADLY and for 220$
[2022-06-28T23:43:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 😂😂😂😂
[2022-06-28T23:43:32] Paolo ⁭: Awesome, 200 usd + 2 years waiting and get a shit
[2022-06-28T23:44:41] Artem Bulashev: We are seeing if we can make price 59$ even after pre sale 👌 should be possible, for cnc🤓 😊 no plastic version
[2022-06-28T23:44:57] Artem Bulashev: They have wait line for that??
[2022-06-28T23:45:03] Artem Bulashev: 😂😂😂😂
[2022-06-28T23:45:28] Paolo ⁭: Yes, my friend paid 179$ + 40$ for shipping and still no arrived
[2022-06-28T23:45:35] Paolo ⁭: 1.2 year ago
[2022-06-28T23:45:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: thinking about it, i'm almost sure it had an issue. it can't be possible to fail so much. and yes, i agree with artem. it's wayyyyy low and it's not ergonomic. (rion throttle)
[2022-06-28T23:45:38] Artem Bulashev: I think they are playing hard to get lol
[2022-06-28T23:45:54] Artem Bulashev: That is …. No words
[2022-06-28T23:46:14] Paolo ⁭: 1.2 is not much for they
[2022-06-28T23:46:26] Paolo ⁭: Some people waiting scooter since 2.5 years xd
[2022-06-28T23:46:37] Artem Bulashev: It is emmm outdated
[2022-06-28T23:46:40] Artem Bulashev: By now
[2022-06-28T23:47:08] Paolo ⁭: I think they invested all preorder money for new shit tronic vesc and for buy new cnc 😂
[2022-06-28T23:47:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: when you really sell premium, i can understand. but it MUST be perfect for the waiting time and price. and it's not 😔
[2022-06-28T23:47:55] Paolo ⁭: Did you tried rion? How you feel the frame?
[2022-06-28T23:48:36] Paolo ⁭: Someone told me it’s so crap
[2022-06-28T23:49:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no, i never tried a rion escooter. not so much users here, and even less ready to let you try it 😰
[2022-06-28T23:49:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for the whole scooter, i can't tell.
[2022-06-28T23:52:29] Artem Bulashev: There is also a factor of less scooters less report of defects. “Oh only one person broke stem” 110 scooters produced word wide 😂😂
[2022-06-29T00:16:41] Happy Giraffe: Most of them cry alone afraid to tell anybody their 6000€ scooter is piece of junk😅
[2022-06-29T00:28:42] rosheee: omg
[2022-06-29T00:28:50] rosheee: fucking kelly 7230 need how many amps xD?
[2022-06-29T00:28:52] rosheee: battery
[2022-06-29T01:04:36] Luis Magalhaes: 300 for 100% battery power i think 😂
[2022-06-29T04:33:57] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5194@29-06-2022_04-33-57.jpg>
[2022-06-29T04:34:27] Artem Bulashev: Well Spintend render skills were not very high, so here is mine, to get more realistic view 😁🤙
[2022-06-29T08:06:59] sombre_enfant: What phase and battery brake u use ? For front and rear ?
[2022-06-29T13:17:56] Кирилл: the upper part reminded me of the "w-w-waaalllyy". Nice one👍
[2022-06-29T13:24:30] Face de Pin Sucé: hahahaha so accurate
[2022-06-29T13:33:02] Artem Bulashev: Haha look
[2022-06-29T13:33:07] Artem Bulashev: With buttons
[2022-06-29T13:33:25] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5195@29-06-2022_13-33-25.jpg>
[2022-06-29T14:46:02] Luis Magalhaes: Looks good 😁
[2022-06-29T14:50:23] Luis Magalhaes: With the board you have in that is it possible to implement a direct cruise control? Like if your riding and it is giving 2v to the controller press a button and it maintains thoso 2v to the controller even if you let the throttle?
[2022-06-29T14:50:46] Luis Magalhaes: Cruise made by the throttle itself not the controller 😜
[2022-06-29T14:50:50] sombre_enfant: 🧑🏾‍🌾👍🏾
[2022-06-29T14:59:03] Happy Giraffe: Eevaaa
[2022-06-29T15:02:12] Oliver Eliasson: https://spintend.com/products/single-ubox-100v-100a-motor-controller-based-on-vesc Does it come in aluminium case or without?
[2022-06-29T15:03:17] Mirono escooters: Cool
[2022-06-29T15:03:28] Mirono escooters: 22s
[2022-06-29T15:03:45] Кирилл: Same as dual 100v
[2022-06-29T15:03:49] Oliver Eliasson: Yeah sound great
[2022-06-29T15:04:25] Paolo ⁭: Yes but cheap case like flipsky
[2022-06-29T15:04:52] Mirono escooters: For price dont complain
[2022-06-29T15:05:43] Paolo ⁭: They’ve used cheapest components on this version
[2022-06-29T15:06:04] Mirono escooters: Ok.. for price.
[2022-06-29T15:06:17] Mirono escooters: Im still flipsky 75100 gang but this is good
[2022-06-29T15:07:12] Paolo ⁭: I think new flipsky is better
[2022-06-29T15:07:17] Paolo ⁭: BUT FUCK FLIPSKY
[2022-06-29T15:07:28] Paolo ⁭: WHAT COST THEM TO PUT AN ON/OFF BUTTON
[2022-06-29T15:07:40] Paolo ⁭: Is that hard to do?
[2022-06-29T15:12:35] Mirono escooters: It's to sell antispark i hope u know dat..
[2022-06-29T15:32:33] Artem Bulashev: Correct that is how it doesn’t locks ADC output in same position.
[2022-06-29T15:34:20] Artem Bulashev: So you release throttle. If you than start to operate wheel again in either direction, hold will be released right away
[2022-06-29T15:34:54] Artem Bulashev: So accurate name is Throttle hold 🙂
[2022-06-29T15:35:17] Artem Bulashev: Come in the case
[2022-06-29T15:35:46] Artem Bulashev: Agreeeeeeee
[2022-06-29T15:37:35] Luis Magalhaes: Nice and we can turn it on and off?
[2022-06-29T16:03:59] Happy Giraffe: So cheap, letsgo bois!
[2022-06-29T16:04:17] Happy Giraffe: But power button?🌚
[2022-06-29T16:05:50] Happy Giraffe: And now they have some copper plate but it seems it might still be retarded design as they have a fan
[2022-06-29T16:09:13] Mirono escooters: Fan not included
[2022-06-29T16:10:18] Happy Giraffe: Yeah but the design is for a damn fan🌚
[2022-06-29T16:10:53] Happy Giraffe: Still price so excellent I am tempted😂
[2022-06-29T16:14:00] Mirono escooters: ;)
[2022-06-29T17:06:01] Happy Giraffe: Are there 3.3v throttles available or can I use a resistor to bring 5v throttle to 3.3v max?🤔
[2022-06-29T17:06:19] Mirono escooters: I use 5v throttles on 3.3v ☻️☻️☻️
[2022-06-29T17:06:33] Mirono escooters: Ali got universal v throttles
[2022-06-29T17:15:01] Artem Bulashev: That causes instabilities and djitter often from what I read
[2022-06-29T17:15:52] Artem Bulashev: Some ebikes controllers have such but it is nothing for us realistically
[2022-06-29T17:16:30] Artem Bulashev: Mine will have 3.3v direct input - output, as mcu is 3v powered
[2022-06-29T17:16:44] Artem Bulashev: Some aliexpress once tend to work
[2022-06-29T17:16:55] Artem Bulashev: Some people report issues when used on 3.3, as they are made with 5v halls
[2022-06-29T17:33:39] Happy Giraffe: Would using 3.3v throttle with 5v throttle cause the 3.3 function worse? Mode would have to be 5v on adc adapter
[2022-06-29T17:37:17] Happy Giraffe: One would be used for ebrake
[2022-06-29T17:40:01] Artem Bulashev: Doesn’t matter they are on separate adc1/2
[2022-06-29T17:40:22] Artem Bulashev: Connect 3.3v throttle to 3.3v supply and 5v throttle to 5v supply
[2022-06-29T17:45:14] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-06-29T17:45:44] Mirono escooters: I cant see anything, or feel
[2022-06-29T17:45:55] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-06-29T17:46:00] Mirono escooters: Sad vesc doesnt just accept 5v throttl
[2022-06-29T17:50:07] rosheee: U need le adc
[2022-06-29T17:50:09] rosheee: 1,2,3
[2022-06-29T17:52:48] Happy Giraffe: But I have only ADC adapter gen 1
[2022-06-29T17:53:18] Happy Giraffe: Does ADC adapter v2 block bluetooth from single ubox?🤔
[2022-06-29T18:02:05] Happy Giraffe: Dude bought total 20 scooter motors
[2022-06-29T18:07:04] Jan: Well its a nice motor 🤷

[2022-06-29T20:28:03] rosheee: French motors can fit 3x baguettes
[2022-06-29T20:28:36] Luis Magalhaes: mine had 3mm2 had to open a litle to fit the 6mm
[2022-06-29T20:30:14] Paolo ⁭: Normally stock is 4mm2
[2022-06-29T20:34:18] Luis Magalhaes: sorry wrong key it was 4mm2
[2022-06-29T20:35:08] rosheee: 2000w motors big enough
[2022-06-29T20:35:15] rosheee: 3x6mm2 fits vsett motor
[2022-06-29T20:35:22] Luis Magalhaes: mine was 1200w 🤣

[2022-06-29T21:09:34] Jan: 4weeks for controller and battery to arrive
[2022-06-29T21:09:36] sombre_enfant: Here a nearly finished one
[2022-06-29T21:10:05] Jan: Stats?
[2022-06-29T21:10:12] Gigolo Joe: Sleeper af mah dude, keep it up

[2022-06-29T21:11:39] Jan: 20s6p
[2022-06-29T21:12:15] sombre_enfant: Wonder where u fit controller
[2022-06-29T21:13:04] Jan: Took me a while in CAD, to figure out the space. Also for the BMS, this thing is huge. But its all in the floor
[2022-06-29T21:15:11] Jan: Whole Floor is a radiator
[2022-06-29T21:15:28] Jan: Lets see how it performs, long way to go
[2022-06-29T21:16:13] sombre_enfant: I dont find paint
[2022-06-29T21:16:39] sombre_enfant: And how much i can go on battery build 16s, 17s maybe hard
[2022-06-29T21:16:58] sombre_enfant: @roscheeee where the battery at ?
[2022-06-29T21:17:45] Jan: How much?

[2022-06-29T21:18:18] Jan: 16s about 100kmh
[2022-06-29T21:18:37] sombre_enfant: Its already easy 60kph gps with shitty 13s no field weakening and hard amps...
[2022-06-29T21:19:48] Jan: I wonder how much the 20s goes with field weakening
[2022-06-29T21:20:06] Jan: I need to buy motorcycle gear
[2022-06-29T21:20:22] sombre_enfant: What setting for that on vesc ? U mean 6p 40t ?
[2022-06-29T21:20:45] Jan: Not my setup. @roscheeee knows
[2022-06-29T21:21:31] sombre_enfant: Soon i will do 13s6p 50e so i can push a bit more amps without battery crazy hot, then 16s6p 50e then 16s6p 40t later...
[2022-06-29T21:25:41] Jan: Molicel P45B ;)
[2022-06-29T21:31:00] Mirono escooters: On sale yet?
[2022-06-29T21:34:47] Happy Giraffe: Be careful when shipping batteries with UPS
[2022-06-29T21:35:00] Happy Giraffe: If they can dent my pot...😂

[2022-06-29T22:33:31] rosheee: XD
[2022-06-29T22:59:43] Luis Magalhaes: but the disk has to go off side too ?
[2022-06-29T22:59:52] Luis Magalhaes: same as caliper
[2022-06-29T23:06:20] rosheee: Yah fail is that disc goes wrong side Xd
[2022-06-29T23:07:25] rosheee: Front u can change just the stems for magura Rear ...DIY
[2022-06-29T23:47:39] Luis Magalhaes: Yup rear you are fuck up dont have the holes to put the caliper
[2022-06-29T23:54:40] Paolo ⁭: Shit brake
[2022-06-30T00:17:32] rosheee: Use mt8 lever and diffefent pads .u feel difference
[2022-06-30T00:18:09] Mirono escooters: As long as it stops
[2022-06-30T00:19:09] Paolo ⁭: But still much different from all magura xd
[2022-06-30T00:19:15] rosheee: magura is shit
[2022-06-30T00:19:19] rosheee: brakes like brembo
[2022-06-30T00:19:40] Paolo ⁭: Face de pin
[2022-06-30T00:19:48] rosheee: brembo where?
[2022-06-30T00:21:42] Happy Giraffe: It's just not meant for your purpose lol
[2022-06-30T00:21:52] rosheee: nono :D
[2022-06-30T00:22:09] Mirono escooters: Nothing is.
[2022-06-30T00:22:19] rosheee: it is good brake but can't fit on kaabo so mt8 levers + kool stop pads = ❤️
[2022-06-30T00:22:33] rosheee: and we will see how that 180mm discs perform
[2022-06-30T00:23:18] Paolo ⁭: Piston will explod lol
[2022-06-30T00:23:28] rosheee: NICE @_@
[2022-06-30T00:23:42] Paolo ⁭: Diecasted with recycled aluminium, shit
[2022-06-30T00:24:04] Paolo ⁭: In china cost only 3$ the zoom caliper
[2022-06-30T00:24:05] rosheee: i change it this friday
[2022-06-30T00:25:40] rosheee: what if 2 zoom calipers added per disc?
[2022-06-30T00:25:45] rosheee: scooter explodes?
[2022-06-30T00:25:58] Mirono escooters: Bruh how
[2022-06-30T00:26:13] Mirono escooters: Do dual disk front brake like on some ebikes :)
[2022-06-30T00:26:41] rosheee: with 4 calipers on front?
[2022-06-30T00:27:07] rosheee: if only 2 then 1 is infront of stem and 1 @ rear
[2022-06-30T00:27:17] rosheee: then i spin roundround

[2022-06-30T12:32:35] Federico77: @mirkus74 ADAPTTO😍
[2022-06-30T12:38:52] Mirko Boni: Adaptto? O my god! In my opinion it is the best in the world!
[2022-06-30T12:38:56] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-06-30T12:39:31] Mirko Boni: Fede, il adaptto è quello che usa Vic nella sua ebike
[2022-06-30T12:39:58] sombre_enfant: Wow u got pic how they look ?
[2022-06-30T12:48:49] rosheee: Like kelly x nucular
[2022-06-30T13:00:53] Jan: 1kg 320x210x70 is quite the block
[2022-06-30T14:23:47] Unknown: LoL adaptto really? They went out of business about 5 years ago. The closest thing to them nowadays is Nucular, there are some similarities. They took certain features of the adaptto controller and improved on them such as charge thru controller function but now the motor coil is used for the stepup rather than a separate external charge coil. Their display was black and white, now it's redesigned and backlit. They were super popular with ebike guys just like Nucular is today

[2022-07-01T02:32:17] Stan: I will try to test then somehow
[2022-07-01T09:33:18] Happy Giraffe: Which site?
[2022-07-01T10:03:27] Stan: https://liquidowo.pl/akumulator-ogniwo-bateria-3000mah-sony-vtc6,3,774,1398

[2022-07-01T13:25:01] Stan: Yh
[2022-07-01T13:52:47] Stan: Hi has anyone got a 16s antispark switch I could buy ?
[2022-07-01T16:57:17] Happy Giraffe: Gonna be the frame of my ebike. 180mm shimano not suce, need Magura asap
[2022-07-01T16:58:12] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2022-07-01T17:00:04] Mirono escooters: Good b1tt space
[2022-07-01T17:00:51] Happy Giraffe: Yes, batt only takes 40cm
[2022-07-01T19:08:45] rosheee: Wobbles at 140?
[2022-07-01T19:53:19] Happy Giraffe: Nope, just not enough raw power for my liking
[2022-07-01T22:58:40] Artem Bulashev: made some more renders - also without Buttons module

[2022-07-01T22:59:02] Mirono escooters: I tried. Seller didnt ship after 3 weeks refund haha
[2022-07-01T22:59:07] Artem Bulashev: I have better one and it is not very safe - it only stopps pushing 100% of set amps when battery is 99.99% full
[2022-07-01T22:59:41] Mirono escooters: They also dont want paypal. Sketchy
[2022-07-01T23:00:16] Artem Bulashev: yeah because it is basicaly a CV Power supply more than charger
[2022-07-01T23:00:26] Artem Bulashev: I got money back for mine
[2022-07-01T23:00:30] Unknown: Artem should there be an option on for the buttons on the spintend pre order page? I don't see any options or drop-down for the button option vs no button option
[2022-07-01T23:00:51] Unknown: Ugh, I remember that. Smart BMS to the rescue
[2022-07-01T23:01:07] Mirono escooters: Inded
[2022-07-01T23:01:13] Artem Bulashev: at around 80% it should switch to constant voltage and let battery suck onlt as many amps as it needs and not push into it 8amps till it explodes on one cell
[2022-07-01T23:01:19] Mirono escooters: His and spintend is diff no?
[2022-07-01T23:01:26] Mirono escooters: Well yea but 200€ prob

[2022-07-01T23:02:16] Unknown: About the button option..?
[2022-07-01T23:02:43] Unknown: I want to pre-order but don't want to order the wrong "version"
[2022-07-01T23:02:50] Artem Bulashev: they will add it later will be possible to add no issue
[2022-07-01T23:02:58] Unknown: Oh ok cool

[2022-07-01T23:04:37] Artem Bulashev: lol
[2022-07-01T23:04:41] Mirono escooters: No one with scooter is. We waste it

[2022-07-01T23:05:03] Mirono escooters: Ye 10 is alot
[2022-07-01T23:06:37] Artem Bulashev: I saved them a year of work in RD and free labor for designing it for many month 🙂 they get planty them self 🙂
[2022-07-01T23:07:26] Unknown: Is 4px better than typical mail post? Worth the extra $6?? @artBula
[2022-07-01T23:07:49] Artem Bulashev: that is a reason why I didn’t manufacture my self - my costs would be above 50$ to make it - end product would be about 90-110$ instead of 59$
[2022-07-01T23:07:54] Unknown: I've never ordered from spintend to USA 🙈
[2022-07-01T23:08:29] Paolo ⁭: * 10 = 10000
[2022-07-01T23:08:39] Paolo ⁭: <animation>
[2022-07-01T23:08:43] Artem Bulashev: yeah
[2022-07-01T23:08:44] Unknown: Well, $20 shipping better be faster than $16 shipping in any case lol
[2022-07-01T23:08:45] Paolo ⁭: This is @artBula

[2022-07-01T23:10:31] Artem Bulashev: gonna go sleep wifi flys away with my son on monday and I will finally have time to make a battery building mess in here
[2022-07-01T23:11:08] Paolo ⁭: Normally chinese pay designer for the project , never pay for each order . They are so stranger xd

[2022-07-01T23:12:31] Unknown: I know too the (very seldom) wonderful feeling of actually having time alone to focus and make a mess of my hobby room/living room while the wife and kids are away! Hoot hoot

[2022-07-01T23:12:48] Paolo ⁭: I still with my 0$
[2022-07-01T23:13:39] Mirono escooters: 4px is a cooperation between alot of shipperd, its crazy fast
[2022-07-01T23:13:40] Unknown: I have to try it. Designed by our friend Artem and what a design it is. I feel it's only right to give it a shot. I'm sure will be really sweet
[2022-07-01T23:13:51] Mirono escooters: Defo worth it
[2022-07-01T23:13:57] Unknown: Oh cool. That's what I went with 👍👌
[2022-07-01T23:13:58] Mirono escooters: Support artem

[2022-07-01T23:23:38] Artem Bulashev: haha 😄 absolutely what ever works 🙂 I’m sure 50euros is not for every one to spend on throttle
[2022-07-01T23:29:24] Paolo ⁭: Only for rich man 🥲
[2022-07-01T23:30:12] Unknown: Well, I couldn't not try it 😜
[2022-07-01T23:30:45] Unknown: Don't you have like 50 motors on the shelf at all times? LoL
[2022-07-01T23:32:43] Paolo ⁭: Company money isn’t my money🥲
[2022-07-01T23:33:51] Mirono escooters: Eh for a good project
[2022-07-01T23:35:19] Mirono escooters: And 3.3v throtle safes you hassle
[2022-07-01T23:35:19] Unknown: Oh dang. The illusion of a rich man 🙈. I always wondered how you get boxes and boxes of motors
[2022-07-01T23:35:20] Unknown: Lol
[2022-07-01T23:36:07] Mirono escooters: Run with motors and donate
[2022-07-01T23:39:14] Paolo ⁭: Company is mine, but I pay lot tax in this shit country. That’s make me poor, otherwise I will be rich😂
[2022-07-01T23:40:03] Unknown: Hey Paolo... Do you know of any 10" motors that would be a worthwhile upgrade from the 10+ motors... Even with a wider dropout, I can always widen the swingarms, just can't use 11" due to tire hitting the shock. I've run out of projects on my scooter and now I'm eyeing the motors even though they really are powerful enough for me LoL. Just curious if you know of any 10" motors that would be a huge step up...
[2022-07-01T23:40:47] Paolo ⁭: It’s an awesome country , I love culture. But I don’t like government, if you don’t do a little tax evasion you will haven’t money for your like🥲🥲
[2022-07-01T23:41:14] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes there are
[2022-07-01T23:41:19] Unknown: I totally understand that. USA taxes are also outrageous. Income tax, annual auto tax, annual property tax, sales tax... The list goes on lol.
[2022-07-01T23:41:28] Face de Pin Sucé: With 10mm² wires too for 10inch
[2022-07-01T23:41:34] Paolo ⁭: Usa is much better
[2022-07-01T23:41:41] Unknown: 🤔
[2022-07-01T23:41:41] sombre_enfant: Tax fraud, Sucé
[2022-07-01T23:41:52] Tommy: But no free hospital🙈
[2022-07-01T23:41:56] Paolo ⁭: Exist 65mm with 10mm2 wire
[2022-07-01T23:41:59] Unknown: That's scary. Italy must be really bad
[2022-07-01T23:42:02] sombre_enfant: Paye en liquide stp🧑🏾‍🌾🧑🏾‍🌾
[2022-07-01T23:42:14] Face de Pin Sucé: 👍
[2022-07-01T23:42:21] Unknown: Nope. Still haven't gotten my shoulder looked at from my accident 3 weeks ago
[2022-07-01T23:42:37] Unknown: Do you know the dropout width on those?
[2022-07-01T23:43:02] Paolo ⁭: I got hospital one time only😂 I don’t need it, with your saved tax you will be rich enough to pay hospital😂
[2022-07-01T23:43:13] Paolo ⁭: 155mm
[2022-07-01T23:43:35] Unknown: Really? That's not bad at all. 10mm spacer on each side
[2022-07-01T23:43:49] Unknown: Where does such motor exist?
[2022-07-01T23:44:12] Tommy: 65 da 10 pollici?
[2022-07-01T23:44:48] Paolo ⁭: I think isn’t that useful, but will be a good upgrade than vsett motor
[2022-07-01T23:44:56] Unknown: I think my 10+ motors are high kv and very inefficient on 20s LoL. 43ah battery saves me but still inefficient
[2022-07-01T23:45:00] Paolo ⁭: I just talking about the price, I don’t think if worth it
[2022-07-01T23:45:09] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_5213@01-07-2022_23-45-09.jpg>
[2022-07-01T23:45:29] Unknown: Gotcha. That makes sense. That's what I was wondering. If price would justify the upgrade
[2022-07-01T23:45:46] Paolo ⁭: This is 10 inch
[2022-07-01T23:45:46] Unknown: Those are a thing of beauty
[2022-07-01T23:45:54] Jan: Any better motor for 20s that can be purchased from a website?
[2022-07-01T23:46:13] Paolo ⁭: I personally never tried it, because I don’t like 10 inch stability
[2022-07-01T23:46:30] Paolo ⁭: If you try 11 inch in your scooter you will have to see a lot difference
[2022-07-01T23:46:41] Paolo ⁭: 10 inch?
[2022-07-01T23:46:48] Unknown: Right, if I could mount 11" I would. Unfortunately I think rear tire hit shock when compressed
[2022-07-01T23:47:14] Unknown: Would need 11x swingarms and I'm not sure those would work with suspension geometry
[2022-07-01T23:48:01] Paolo ⁭: Yes you are right
[2022-07-01T23:49:42] Mirono escooters: Belgium with highest tax of Europe and second worst debt We doing great.

[2022-07-02T01:06:49] Artem Bulashev: Yes they are a module
[2022-07-02T01:07:56] Artem Bulashev: You can put it on if you want. Buy with or without buttons module.

[2022-07-02T15:04:34] Luis Magalhaes: Why?
[2022-07-02T15:05:21] Luis Magalhaes: Change to 6mm2 or 10mm2?
[2022-07-02T15:55:36] rosheee: To 6mm2
[2022-07-02T15:55:43] rosheee: XD used 300W solderiron
[2022-07-02T15:55:45] rosheee: Canz desolder
[2022-07-02T15:55:48] rosheee: Cant
[2022-07-02T15:56:31] Luis Magalhaes: 😂😂
[2022-07-02T16:10:09] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_5216@02-07-2022_16-10-09.jpg>
[2022-07-02T16:23:29] Unknown: The factory solder on the phase wires where the wire connects to the copper windings is pretty much impossible to de-solder. It looks like they use copper solder or something that a typical iron will never melt. I cut mine back as close as possible to the factory solder blob and then just cut it off with snips.

[2022-07-02T16:26:49] Unknown: Luckily the factory solder on the 10+ motors are just soldered at the very tip, just a blob of Kryptonian solder that Superman could not melt 🤣. Being done like that it is easy to snip off the blob without losing length on the winding leads
[2022-07-02T17:25:09] rosheee: Yes
[2022-07-02T17:25:29] rosheee: Kaabo has fucking 4cm long krypronithypersolder fuck
[2022-07-02T17:25:33] rosheee: Anyway
[2022-07-02T17:25:49] rosheee: Vsett motor easier than g30 to redo

[2022-07-02T17:43:12] sombre_enfant: Fact its so tight on g30
[2022-07-02T17:43:29] rosheee: yah when i do single 6mm2 no prob
[2022-07-02T17:43:39] sombre_enfant: Xiaomi the easier
[2022-07-02T17:43:41] rosheee: 3x single 6mm2 + hall sensor
[2022-07-02T17:44:07] sombre_enfant: Sucé motor with no wire insulation

[2022-07-03T10:49:35] Unknown: I have a makerx dv6 dual esk8 vesc
[2022-07-03T10:52:42] Unknown: Basically, I am not happy with the performance, running 12s 150a pack, yes is powerful, but I feel like is lacking some punch, what I noticed, is during hard acceleration the amp gauge on rt data only goes up by as much as its set on motor amps, doesn't go over/take into account the absolute max.
[2022-07-03T11:01:45] Gigolo Joe: That's how it supposed to work
[2022-07-03T11:02:51] Unknown: In what circumstances the abs max kicks in?
[2022-07-03T11:03:05] Unknown: Or what's the function of this value
[2022-07-03T11:27:42] rosheee: Read xD
[2022-07-03T11:27:48] rosheee: There is 'help' there
[2022-07-03T11:28:38] rosheee: U can set higher battery am but since u use 12S ^^'..u maybe go..45kmh
[2022-07-03T11:28:41] rosheee: 50kmh
[2022-07-03T11:28:45] rosheee: Max
[2022-07-03T11:30:33] Unknown: I'm geared for 70kmh no load, i myself hit 50/53 then i shat myself
[2022-07-03T11:31:51] Unknown: Fair enough 😂
[2022-07-03T11:32:59] Unknown: The thing is, when i had the 4.2 vesc version, i was having abs and dvr faults very often, 6 vesc version haven't had a single fault,
[2022-07-03T11:33:42] Mirono escooters: Ha me too but with too mich power
[2022-07-03T11:35:11] Unknown: Now that said, with the 4.20 version, i upgraded the fw to 5.3 and that gave me an unexpected impressive increase in power, you wouldn't expect a fw update to give you x2 the performance, in fact, I start getting drv issues and abs overcurrent on 50a motor settings, but it was very torquey, very,
[2022-07-03T11:36:36] Mirono escooters: That's weird, sounds like shunt value is weong
[2022-07-03T11:37:07] Unknown: So I contacted the manufacturer and he said that the stock fw was not supposed to run on that specific vesc because it will give false amp, since that specific vesc had a certain value resistors, in fact, once I put back the custom firmware that he sent me, the performance were again lower with the same amount of amps,
[2022-07-03T11:38:30] Unknown: Now with the new vesc i run stock fw, but even with 105a per motor, I feel it a bit sluggish
[2022-07-03T11:40:55] Unknown: If anyone has experience with eskates, to match an evolve bamboo gt in acceleration, I have to set my motor amps to 55, which is weird because ad far as I know, evolve esc have something like 20a motor amps
[2022-07-03T11:47:29] Happy Giraffe: Usually absolute power is some millisecond peak value that vesc lets pass
[2022-07-03T11:48:09] Happy Giraffe: On Spintend single board and some fw some problem persists if you dont crank abs current up
[2022-07-03T11:49:33] Mirono escooters: As i expected
[2022-07-03T11:49:42] Mirono escooters: Oof i got it high haha
[2022-07-03T11:50:05] Mirono escooters: 20a phase? I doubt. Thats so little
[2022-07-03T11:50:37] Unknown: 20 each motor eh
[2022-07-03T11:50:48] Unknown: If i set 20 each motor I barely move
[2022-07-03T11:50:55] Unknown: 😂😂
[2022-07-03T11:51:04] Mirono escooters: Yea thats ultra low for motor current
[2022-07-03T11:51:10] Mirono escooters: Xiaomi is stock 55 lol
[2022-07-03T11:51:28] Paolo ⁭: 4 motor they are
[2022-07-03T11:51:31] Paolo ⁭: I think
[2022-07-03T11:51:37] Mirono escooters: Still little
[2022-07-03T11:51:49] Paolo ⁭: The wheel is 5 times little xd
[2022-07-03T11:51:49] Unknown: 2 motors
[2022-07-03T11:51:57] Paolo ⁭: The torque at same current is x5
[2022-07-03T11:54:24] Unknown: I do have 175mm pneumatic

[2022-07-03T11:57:22] Mirono escooters: But their kv is way higher..
[2022-07-03T11:57:51] Mirono escooters: My friend runs 120 per lol
[2022-07-03T12:15:24] Unknown: Yeh me too i run 105 right now, but if the esc is underperforming I wouldn't be happy
[2022-07-03T12:15:58] Mirono escooters: Thats weird

[2022-07-03T22:19:07] Happy Giraffe: Damn china sellers
[2022-07-03T22:29:29] Mirono escooters: Why?
[2022-07-03T22:49:12] Happy Giraffe: Isnt it the one you ordered 3 months ago?
[2022-07-03T22:49:49] Mirono escooters: I got a refund haba
[2022-07-03T22:50:03] Mirono escooters: Now i asked if there was stock before hassle begun
[2022-07-03T22:50:13] Mirono escooters: And there is, no lockdown now
[2022-07-03T22:50:32] Mirono escooters: So i take bet. After i got 67.2v 5a charger for that price🤨😳
[2022-07-03T23:08:19] Happy Giraffe: I would just buy the satiator to never have to talk these ali guys again😂🙈
[2022-07-03T23:10:03] Mirono escooters: Satiator?
[2022-07-03T23:17:52] rosheee: Replaced connect0rs Only using 7mm plugs now 8mm and 10awg even lower baguettism
[2022-07-03T23:20:41] Happy Giraffe: Grin charger
[2022-07-03T23:21:02] Happy Giraffe: Do measure again from motor tab🌚
[2022-07-03T23:28:28] rosheee: i measured even with expensive device for that
[2022-07-03T23:28:30] rosheee: before done test
[2022-07-03T23:28:32] rosheee: had 14
[2022-07-03T23:28:42] rosheee: i can do when i am back @workshop
[2022-07-03T23:28:52] rosheee: U JEALOUS ?
[2022-07-03T23:29:07] Happy Giraffe: Ok
[2022-07-03T23:29:13] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-07-03T23:29:22] rosheee: btw i can't believe it as well
[2022-07-04T00:27:52] Unknown: FYI on the adaptto controllers. Again, they are no longer made, probably 4-5 years since they stopped being produced. Nucular took the general idea and built up on it vastly in many aspects. Smaller size, better functionality, higher rated, and way more failsafe. Plus firmware is unrecognizable from adaptto to Nucular. They were groundbreaking and amazing for their time but quickly surpassed in all aspects.
[2022-07-04T00:29:03] Unknown: New Nucs are now implementing encoder motors such as Talaria and QS encoder motors 👌. Even under Russian suppression they are making progress
[2022-07-04T00:29:15] rosheee: super
[2022-07-04T00:29:21] rosheee: and where buy?
[2022-07-04T00:29:30] rosheee: wait 2 years
[2022-07-04T00:29:39] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-07-04T00:29:41] Unknown: Only for the best of us 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-07-04T00:29:47] rosheee: yah i still wait
[2022-07-04T00:29:47] Unknown: Sorry
[2022-07-04T00:29:47] Happy Giraffe: Talaria hmm, heard of them on Kilovolt ebiked YT channel
[2022-07-04T00:29:55] Unknown: LoL
[2022-07-04T00:30:09] rosheee: 2x24 2x12
[2022-07-04T00:31:14] Unknown: They are still producing and selling 24Fs everyday. 6F and 12F production has been stopped before the war. I have 4 Nucular controllers in my possession, just a matter of looking for them
[2022-07-04T00:31:28] rosheee: super
[2022-07-04T00:31:32] rosheee: but we had that
[2022-07-04T00:31:38] rosheee: i ordered ^_^
[2022-07-04T00:31:42] rosheee: then i ahve 4 as well
[2022-07-04T00:31:44] Unknown: Great
[2022-07-04T00:31:45] rosheee: i can order 10 more
[2022-07-04T00:31:47] rosheee: then i have 14
[2022-07-04T00:31:48] Unknown: Super
[2022-07-04T00:32:10] rosheee: then i make cluster and get 1337gW and fly to saturn
[2022-07-04T00:32:16] rosheee: with logfile
[2022-07-04T00:32:21] Unknown: Only then 🤓
[2022-07-04T00:32:21] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-07-04T00:32:48] Unknown: How have I found 4 controllers in 6 months and nobody else can find them?
[2022-07-04T00:33:02] rosheee: ^^' i don't buy used
[2022-07-04T00:33:08] Unknown: Poor thing
[2022-07-04T00:33:17] Unknown: They don't "wear out" you know
[2022-07-04T00:33:33] rosheee: u told us alrdy
[2022-07-04T00:33:58] Unknown: You sound bitter
[2022-07-04T00:34:14] rosheee: no ^_^ just no time talk about same stuff again and again
[2022-07-04T00:34:43] Unknown: Why do you keep responding then?
[2022-07-04T00:39:42] rosheee: maybe i try tronic 400 or 750 same price as nucular
[2022-07-04T00:40:56] Unknown: That would be cool. I'm curious about them myself.
[2022-07-04T00:41:10] Unknown: I'm surprised 250 was such a let down
[2022-07-04T00:54:29] rosheee: i still asking how motor can be 13 degrees less than mosfet temp.
[2022-07-04T00:54:39] rosheee: that cooling is impressive.please share how to
[2022-07-04T00:54:40] rosheee: wanna learn
[2022-07-04T00:54:41] rosheee: ❤️
[2022-07-04T00:56:59] Unknown: Is it nothing I do, it is the controller. Because motor temp sensor is NTC 10k b:3950 and MOSFET internal temp sensor is different beta value at lower temp
[2022-07-04T00:57:52] Unknown: Once up to temp (35-40c) they are both accurate at the same measure. At resting temp the beta values are skewed on the motor probe. MOSFET temp is accurate always
[2022-07-04T00:59:46] Unknown: Externally mounted dual 12Fs on thermal pads. They just stay cool 🤷🏻‍♂️. Vsett 10 motors with 11awg phase wires and (rear) 80/225 85C max at windings and covers barely warm compared to stock Vsett setup motors on same ride and terrain (compared cover temps to stock Vsett of a friend after the same ride) 🤷🏻‍♂️. I don't what else you want me to say.
[2022-07-04T01:11:49] Unknown: 12Fs externally mounted using dual layers of thermal pads and plexiglass plate between them. Rear controller is hottest and goes 10-15C above ambient at most with 80a batt/225a phase on rear. Front is slightly less and stay very close to ambient always
[2022-07-04T01:11:50] Unknown: <photos/photo_5228@04-07-2022_01-11-50.jpg>
[2022-07-04T01:11:50] Unknown: <photos/photo_5229@04-07-2022_01-11-50.jpg>
[2022-07-04T01:12:38] rosheee: so ur last logfile was at 10 degrees C?
[2022-07-04T01:12:45] rosheee: 15 degrees c?
[2022-07-04T01:12:48] Unknown: Above ambient, yes
[2022-07-04T01:13:02] rosheee: how warm is it in summer where u live?
[2022-07-04T01:13:04] Unknown: For MOSFET temp
[2022-07-04T01:13:10] rosheee: u use thick thermalpad
[2022-07-04T01:13:16] Unknown: It was 80F the night I took that log
[2022-07-04T01:13:16] rosheee: ^^' and plexiglas is very thermal
[2022-07-04T01:13:29] rosheee: 34 degrees C max temp.
[2022-07-04T01:13:29] Unknown: Yes, exactly
[2022-07-04T01:13:37] rosheee: and i have another logfile from u
[2022-07-04T01:13:39] rosheee: same log5
[2022-07-04T01:13:42] rosheee: from winter ^^'
[2022-07-04T01:13:45] rosheee: anyway sleep well
[2022-07-04T01:13:48] Unknown: Right. 85a battery and 225a phase max on rear motor/controller
[2022-07-04T01:13:50] rosheee: and thanksfor your imput
[2022-07-04T01:14:29] Unknown: Plus rear controller is potted
[2022-07-04T01:16:43] rosheee: <photos/photo_5230@04-07-2022_01-16-43.jpg>
[2022-07-04T01:16:45] rosheee: super
[2022-07-04T01:16:59] rosheee: thicc thermalpad = worst plexi = isolat0r
[2022-07-04T01:17:16] rosheee: can u send us more pics of the thermalpads + plexi?
[2022-07-04T01:17:25] rosheee: maybe we can learn from it
[2022-07-04T01:17:31] rosheee: looks like legit cooling
[2022-07-04T01:17:47] Unknown: Plexiglass is for rigidity and mounting purposes, nothing to do with thermal anything
[2022-07-04T01:19:35] Unknown: I just cut plexiglass plates and mounted the controllers to them because the controllers are mounted to an odd shaped surface. Then I put thermal pads on each side of that plexiglass plate. I really did that to reduce vibrations and shock to the controllers, had nothing to do with thermal concerns. May have inadvertently created a decent cooling solution in the process
[2022-07-04T01:20:35] Mirono escooters: No one uses plexi for cooling, cmon
[2022-07-04T01:21:21] Unknown: Plexiglass was for mounting purposes only
[2022-07-04T01:21:21] Unknown: <photos/photo_5232@04-07-2022_01-21-21.jpg>
[2022-07-04T01:21:22] Unknown: <photos/photo_5233@04-07-2022_01-21-22.jpg>
[2022-07-04T01:21:40] Unknown: And thermal pads were vibration dampening
[2022-07-04T01:21:50] Mirono escooters: Smort
[2022-07-04T01:22:32] Unknown: I didn't want the controllers subject to every bump and jolt in the road so I dampened their mounting with thermal pads
[2022-07-04T01:24:41] rosheee: can nucular also take logfile with both controllers as 1?
[2022-07-04T01:24:51] rosheee: or does it make 2 logfiles for each controller?
[2022-07-04T01:24:59] Unknown: Each is separate unfortunately.
[2022-07-04T01:25:02] rosheee: because see only 1 controller as log
[2022-07-04T01:25:16] rosheee: ok tech support told me it isnt ^^'
[2022-07-04T01:25:18] Unknown: But certain perimeters are from both
[2022-07-04T01:25:21] rosheee: ok
[2022-07-04T01:25:27] rosheee: thanks for your input
[2022-07-04T01:25:41] rosheee: i tell nucular support why they tell me wrong stuff
[2022-07-04T01:25:51] Unknown: Anytime. Listen, I'm not ever trying to be difficult or an asshole... Just sharing my experience
[2022-07-04T01:25:54] rosheee: so u have logfile for 2nd as well'
[2022-07-04T01:26:07] rosheee: i would just love see both controllers
[2022-07-04T01:26:09] rosheee: same time
[2022-07-04T01:26:11] rosheee: how they act
[2022-07-04T01:26:15] Unknown: I didn't log front motor since it runs cooler and less amps than rear
[2022-07-04T01:26:19] Unknown: I can tho
[2022-07-04T01:26:22] rosheee: yes
[2022-07-04T01:26:22] Unknown: No problem
[2022-07-04T01:26:26] rosheee: ^_^ then 2 logfiles
[2022-07-04T01:26:31] rosheee: with both temps in C or F
[2022-07-04T01:26:32] Unknown: Absolutely
[2022-07-04T01:26:36] rosheee: not C and F mixed
[2022-07-04T01:26:36] rosheee: ❤️4
[2022-07-04T01:26:43] rosheee: and when 30 C cdegrees
[2022-07-04T01:26:47] Unknown: I will do all C, both motor
[2022-07-04T01:26:48] rosheee: hot summerday
[2022-07-04T01:26:59] rosheee: ❤️❤️ now i have sweet dreams
[2022-07-04T01:27:03] rosheee: thanks for your input
[2022-07-04T01:27:06] Unknown: I will try. Has been around 80-85F here during the days

[2022-07-04T13:32:56] Face de Pin Sucé: Thank you man
[2022-07-04T13:34:06] Konstantin: I don't know how exactly they are calling;)
[2022-07-04T15:18:19] Gigolo Joe: Thanks bröther
[2022-07-04T15:18:56] Mirono escooters: Alu pcb why?
[2022-07-04T15:19:17] Mirono escooters: Wich mosfets?
[2022-07-04T15:19:23] Mirono escooters: So it cool through pcb?
[2022-07-04T15:19:32] Mirono escooters: I know, hold on
[2022-07-04T15:19:55] Paolo ⁭: I sell too😂
[2022-07-04T15:20:15] Mirono escooters: GH1.25 JST wires
[2022-07-04T15:25:27] Face de Pin Sucé: <sticker>
[2022-07-04T15:36:36] Paolo ⁭: Did you tested the one I sold to you?
[2022-07-04T15:45:23] Face de Pin Sucé: @Foujiwara tested it yes, I didn't yet x)
[2022-07-04T15:45:47] Face de Pin Sucé: But I think I'll put it inside a Dualtron Mini and it will be fine
[2022-07-04T15:46:48] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: hein?
[2022-07-04T15:47:06] Face de Pin Sucé: Flip 75100
[2022-07-04T15:47:27] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 🤮
[2022-07-04T15:48:00] Mirono escooters: Why the hate
[2022-07-04T15:48:47] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: no latch overheat temp doesn't work no power 🤮
[2022-07-04T15:49:08] Mirono escooters: Overheat? Sure thats just bad contaxt with another heatsink
[2022-07-04T15:49:14] Mirono escooters: And for price..
[2022-07-04T15:49:44] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: no latch... it's enough 🤮
[2022-07-04T15:50:06] Mirono escooters: ._.

[2022-07-04T16:06:18] Mirono escooters: Y
[2022-07-04T18:19:53] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-07-04T20:21:05] Mirono escooters: When i advised ferrofluid, someone said "overpriced junk" *Sighs *
[2022-07-04T21:05:23] Happy Giraffe: Lol
[2022-07-04T21:06:06] Mirono escooters: I wont even try
[2022-07-04T21:14:08] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-07-04T21:34:05] Unknown: Also *sighs* that's okay, let them learn the hard way. I wouldn't try either lol
[2022-07-04T21:36:15] Mirono escooters: I answered him *sighs* lol
[2022-07-04T21:37:39] Unknown: Haha, way to be 👌sounds like he has it all figured out anyways
[2022-07-04T21:38:01] rosheee: Overpriced
[2022-07-04T21:38:32] Unknown: But works and you always get what you pay for
[2022-07-04T21:38:55] Unknown: The research and development and testing grin put into it is well worth the price
[2022-07-04T21:39:37] Unknown: Your not just paying for the liquid. You're paying for the technology and research that went into producing it as well
[2022-07-04T21:39:44] Mirono escooters: I prefer dumb people over ignorant Dumb cant do shit avout it Ignorant dont want to. Sadly influence others with bs lmao
[2022-07-04T21:39:55] Mirono escooters: And the small quantiti3s especially
[2022-07-04T21:39:58] Unknown: So true
[2022-07-04T21:40:00] Mirono escooters: Not like thats bulk
[2022-07-04T21:40:06] Unknown: Exactly
[2022-07-04T21:40:49] Unknown: And how many times is one person actually buying it... Fill your motors with a few ml's and you're good for a year+
[2022-07-04T21:42:17] Unknown: Anything for our scooters can be considered overpriced lol. PMT tires cost more than half as much as a car tire but we buy them because they work well. Nothing good is cheap
[2022-07-04T21:42:32] Mirono escooters: I use cheaper.ferrofluid not statorade works fine, not best best but hey principe same haha
[2022-07-04T21:42:43] Mirono escooters: Dont cheep on expensive stuff i guess
[2022-07-04T21:43:54] Unknown: Just depends on what you use it for and what your expectations are I suppose. Cheaper ferrofluid is the same idea and probably works just fine as long as it's not conductive lol
[2022-07-04T21:47:13] Mirono escooters: Well its not optimal made for the temps, and heat transfer isa little less (its more made for visual things) statorade is engineered to do what it sqys
[2022-07-04T21:47:25] Mirono escooters: But its still ferrofluid in the core.. :)
[2022-07-04T21:49:50] rosheee: Truth
[2022-07-04T22:41:34] Happy Giraffe: For 200€ motor you pay 10% extra to get ~15-30% more performance. Doesnt seem bad to me🌚
[2022-07-04T22:58:41] Paolo ⁭: 10% maybe
[2022-07-04T23:18:35] Artem Bulashev: Disadvantage ? Cooling should be massively improved that’s the point
[2022-07-04T23:19:51] Artem Bulashev: Spintend on their cheap one went other way - cupper plate on top of fets and than to the casing. I would remove casing and drop it on deck directly through copper as supplied
[2022-07-04T23:22:33] Paolo ⁭: The flipsky way is better
[2022-07-04T23:22:53] Paolo ⁭: The heat is dissipated on pcb and not on the top of mosfet
[2022-07-04T23:23:53] Paolo ⁭: The layer that separate the aluminium and copper is very very subtle, and the cooling would be great
[2022-07-04T23:25:53] Artem Bulashev: I suspect so yes
[2022-07-04T23:27:06] Artem Bulashev: Yeah, I already informed Spintend and they wanted to delay release of this version of single ubox, to redesign it to be same (aluminum pcb) but it was not cost effective to do it now. They will consider it for future though
[2022-07-05T01:05:37] rosheee: yo u want now ferrofluid? pls answer in chat
[2022-07-05T01:05:58] rosheee: i send tomorrow evening
[2022-07-05T01:49:01] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_5244@05-07-2022_01-49-01.jpg>
[2022-07-05T01:49:08] Paolo ⁭: Coincidence @SibClimb ?
[2022-07-05T01:49:30] rosheee: worst company
[2022-07-05T01:49:37] rosheee: job hunters
[2022-07-05T01:49:41] rosheee: pay shit
[2022-07-05T04:09:19] Happy Giraffe: Oh it goes that way
[2022-07-05T08:04:27] Gigolo Joe: What's 'latch'? Overheat issue is easily fixed. Temps work No power? I get over 12kw on single motor so your argument is invalid
[2022-07-05T08:24:38] Face de Pin Sucé: Hahahahaha you crazy
[2022-07-05T08:25:03] rosheee: anyone want ferrofluid?
[2022-07-05T08:25:15] rosheee: 20ml in 2x10ml tubes left
[2022-07-05T09:59:23] francois schempers: hi, I've got a bms that doesn't start anymore, and this component is burning hot, any ideas ? what I've done with it, is adding a R001 to the shunt resistor to double the Amps capacity, bms didn't turn on afterwards, removed the added resistance, still doesn't turn on

[2022-07-05T13:07:09] rosheee: 2.2chf for the tube per 10ml (fcking switzerland) 30chf i had to pay shit dhl vat 165.85usd was 100ml So 19.1chf for 10ml + 2.2chf = 21.3 chf per 10ml
[2022-07-05T14:01:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Did you kept in original box? Coz thats only good for the they ship it😁
[2022-07-05T14:03:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: More close ups pls ,i am interested to see more ,its fun
[2022-07-05T14:03:13] rosheee: Later
[2022-07-05T14:03:15] rosheee: Me at w0rk
[2022-07-05T14:03:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also get some plastic pony head in the front
[2022-07-05T14:03:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 😁
[2022-07-05T14:05:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well you need to know what your doing ,like You can have best ingredients ,but if you cant cook It will be shit anyway
[2022-07-05T14:06:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like i really want to be able to do anodizing
[2022-07-05T14:07:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Just to be able to color (protect) engine housings without paint
[2022-07-05T14:07:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Paints ,powder paints doesnt help at all
[2022-07-05T14:09:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This connects to fluid ,since fluid only does fill gaps and forces the amount of air stuck in magnets before to bridge heat on body and cap more ,so you want to help that cool🤷‍♂
[2022-07-05T14:10:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This is when you remove paint ,get windmills, mill Engine caps
[2022-07-05T14:12:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_5249@05-07-2022_14-12-27.jpg>
[2022-07-05T14:14:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What i point at is an original,has Others edge milled to see this gap

[2022-07-05T14:21:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: The windmill we made pulls air in the middle and push to sides and makes the air more in this gap also
[2022-07-05T14:30:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Where you buy fluid and how much you use?
[2022-07-05T14:30:57] rosheee: i buy it directly from canada
[2022-07-05T14:30:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I usually buy on nexun site ,not that expensive 🤷‍♂
[2022-07-05T14:31:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's why it was fortune i guess 🤷‍♂
[2022-07-05T14:32:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Me bought in Poland,just the amount i need ,no need to bath in that
[2022-07-05T14:33:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well it's Always Really hard ,some ppl listens than takes what he likes from the info if he thinks differently ,but some are like you said🤔
[2022-07-05T14:35:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But reminds me of an Ice Cube quote 😁

[2022-07-05T15:15:20] Mirono escooters: Haters will be haters
[2022-07-05T15:15:31] Mirono escooters: I had no problemos, but i didnt like the feature
[2022-07-05T15:15:39] Mirono escooters: So no long term
[2022-07-05T15:15:40] Mirono escooters: Test
[2022-07-05T15:17:23] sombre_enfant: What it does ?
[2022-07-05T15:18:13] Mirono escooters: It felt jerky and like power limiting hard, or i did bad config haha
[2022-07-05T16:19:36] Gigolo Joe: Sometimes
[2022-07-05T16:46:01] rosheee: <photos/photo_5251@05-07-2022_16-46-01.jpg>
[2022-07-05T19:24:26] Unknown: Hmm my ubox wont work correctly. Everything Seems to be fine etc. Spins on air nicely. But then when i start driving i Can go like 10 metters and then everything goes off. It gives too low voltage error.
[2022-07-05T19:25:05] Mirono escooters: Thats battery
[2022-07-05T19:25:05] Mirono escooters: Lower current
[2022-07-05T19:26:18] Unknown: Umm how
[2022-07-05T19:27:05] francois schempers: bms of battery must be cutting of, or your Vdroping like crasy
[2022-07-05T19:27:24] francois schempers: check in the log at what voltage it is, it can help diagnose
[2022-07-05T19:27:46] francois schempers: in the console you have a command to list the last errors
[2022-07-05T19:35:33] Mirono escooters: Low v error is bms cutting off
[2022-07-05T19:38:06] Unknown: Just changed bms
[2022-07-05T19:38:25] Unknown: It had same problem
[2022-07-05T19:39:01] Unknown: Nothing here
[2022-07-05T19:39:10] Mirono escooters: wich current and battery
[2022-07-05T19:41:16] Unknown: 12s 53.53
[2022-07-05T19:42:59] Mirono escooters: 53a??
[2022-07-05T19:43:04] Mirono escooters: Lower that to like 30 to test
[2022-07-05T19:46:24] Unknown: Hmm now it doesnt crash
[2022-07-05T19:46:56] Unknown: <video_file>
[2022-07-05T19:47:09] Mirono escooters: With lower power?
[2022-07-05T19:47:29] Mirono escooters: Try raising absolute current?
[2022-07-05T19:51:40] Unknown: Now blinking yellow and same problem
[2022-07-05T19:52:43] Unknown: I have made 2 PIN connections with wire inside vesc becouse broke those 2 pins

[2022-07-05T20:00:48] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2022-07-05T20:00:56] Mirono escooters: Up motor to 100 and lower batt to 20 to try
[2022-07-05T20:00:57] Кирилл: Lower the battery current
[2022-07-05T20:01:03] Кирилл: Yep
[2022-07-05T20:01:07] Mirono escooters: Bms tripping i tell ya
[2022-07-05T20:01:26] Кирилл: Battery current must not be higher than motor current
[2022-07-05T20:04:00] Unknown: Same problem
[2022-07-05T20:04:08] Unknown: Now just crashed completely

[2022-07-05T20:06:18] rosheee: Connect with phone
[2022-07-05T20:06:28] rosheee: Then check terminal for fail log
[2022-07-05T20:06:33] rosheee: I PM u maks

[2022-07-05T22:43:34] Jan: Lorentz 😅
[2022-07-05T22:52:56] Jan: Lightning strike has so much amps it can yeet a refrigerator
[2022-07-05T22:53:39] Mirono escooters: Ö
[2022-07-05T22:53:41] Mirono escooters: Video pls
[2022-07-05T22:54:25] Jan: 10'000-20'000amps introduce quite some lorentz force on a cable
[2022-07-05T23:06:45] francois schempers: I though lightning was very high voltage but not so high Amps, that was why people survived
[2022-07-05T23:07:21] Mirono escooters: Yes, same
[2022-07-05T23:11:14] Jan: Voltage is very high. It depends on the resistance on how much current flows. A copper cable has less resistance than a human body
[2022-07-05T23:12:47] Jan: Therefore more power will flow.
[2022-07-05T23:13:48] Jan: But yeah, there is shit ton of power
[2022-07-05T23:35:02] Unknown: Just spent the last 20 minutes reading about lightning 😂😂
[2022-07-05T23:35:43] Mirono escooters: Lol my brain

[2022-07-06T17:21:02] rosheee: they were p0rn
[2022-07-06T17:21:04] rosheee: just the overvoltage
[2022-07-06T17:21:16] rosheee: but 12s showing 77V?
[2022-07-06T17:21:38] rosheee: 1st he had wrong FW of ubox dual on it

[2022-07-06T18:51:36] Happy Giraffe: Worst price/performance ratio
[2022-07-06T18:52:39] Paolo ⁭: Why , I paid 160€ and is 300% better than my old rx550 paid 120€
[2022-07-06T18:53:17] Mirono escooters: When a shoe is off, guy is dead. 90% of the time. Foot starts swelling, shoe pops off
[2022-07-06T18:53:38] rosheee: U learned from the street...shit..now i know

[2022-07-06T20:05:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sadly this is true mostly , the picture looks really sad And let's not forget it's not just picture RIP The amount of blood is really telling also , that's not even fully fresh😔 And just behind him 3-5 cm deep pothole thingy He could loose contoll and headbang slided on the road 😒

[2022-07-06T21:11:43] Unknown: Fuck that is so sad. I can't even imagine, and yes... It's a picture to us but a life lost to him and his family. Reminder to us all how fragile life is. I crashed at 15mph in my driveway on small 500w scooter 3 weeks ago and my shoulder will never be the same. As much as I hate helmets and rarely wear one, the more I see the more I realize how stupid I am for being stubborn
[2022-07-06T21:18:10] Mirono escooters: Atleast a basic helmet 😢
[2022-07-06T21:26:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well ,lot ppl doesnt like ff coz they feel goofy ,strange etc

[2022-07-06T21:37:35] rosheee: "kindly"
[2022-07-06T21:37:35] rosheee: ❤️
[2022-07-06T21:46:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That esc has already antispark start thing ,no need for that 🤷‍♂ Or what's the plan , this is to avoid battery sparks above 120 A
[2022-07-06T21:47:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But how can you achive that? Whole kinda strange
[2022-07-06T21:47:42] rosheee: I acjieved fucking up the 100V display

[2022-07-06T21:48:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Coz you set nothing ,this will not protect that
[2022-07-06T21:48:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Imagine setting 180a batt amps this shit melts
[2022-07-06T21:49:03] Mirko Boni: Thanks for the explanation! So is it better not to put it on?
[2022-07-06T21:49:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I never used any similar this way,
[2022-07-06T21:50:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Its a dumb fuse if you set normal numbers, nothing should happen never
[2022-07-06T21:50:51] Mirko Boni: What do you think of this instead?
[2022-07-06T21:51:01] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_5280@06-07-2022_21-51-01.jpg>
[2022-07-06T21:51:57] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_5281@06-07-2022_21-51-57.jpg>
[2022-07-06T21:53:05] Mirono escooters: So just a big resistor?
[2022-07-06T21:53:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This another thing what's new
[2022-07-06T21:54:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Makes heat when you are full batt and regen
[2022-07-06T21:54:48] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-07-06T21:54:50] Mirono escooters: Pft
[2022-07-06T21:55:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: While this sounds smart
[2022-07-06T21:56:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You may need it for short time
[2022-07-06T21:56:19] Gigolo Joe: The board for the regan is a joke, it supports only upto 10A regan (info from the website)
[2022-07-06T21:57:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 10a not to much if thats max brake power 🤔
[2022-07-06T21:57:32] Gigolo Joe: Same stopping power as using your shoe
[2022-07-06T21:57:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In a tong🤔
[2022-07-06T21:58:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If it would -10 regen power , with two engine that would be more
[2022-07-06T21:59:48] rosheee: Still asking myself and YOU GUYS WHY DIS RESULTS
[2022-07-06T21:59:55] rosheee: With flipsky75100
[2022-07-06T21:59:59] rosheee: And 3m phasewire
[2022-07-06T22:00:21] Mirko Boni: Exactly
[2022-07-06T22:01:53] Mirko Boni: However, it is not clear what this large heat sink called a brake resistor is
[2022-07-06T22:02:14] Gigolo Joe: 10a regan even on dual motor setup is weak af 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2022-07-06T22:02:28] Gigolo Joe: Try again
[2022-07-06T22:02:32] rosheee: Done
[2022-07-06T22:02:49] Gigolo Joe: Some fookeri is going on then
[2022-07-06T22:02:51] rosheee: XD alwa,s strange not good flioskyshitfuckxrap
[2022-07-06T22:02:54] Paolo ⁭: Is this antispark circuit?

[2022-07-06T22:03:25] Mirko Boni: I thought this too! I asked the technician! He told me this was fine!
[2022-07-06T22:03:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dunno the name ,uses extra power to make heat
[2022-07-06T22:04:00] Mirko Boni: No Paolo! Resistore per la frenata rigenerativa
[2022-07-06T22:04:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: In some USA cars ,when you bought to eu you find them , They make yellow blinker system for them what's not really compatible with system it self so they use this to kill spikes
[2022-07-06T22:04:56] Mirko Boni: So there is no current in the heatsink?
[2022-07-06T22:06:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: @SirGeoff could explain better if he has time, he understands what i am just trying to say
[2022-07-06T22:06:45] Mirko Boni: Sorry, I don't speak English!
[2022-07-06T22:07:37] rosheee: U do good!!!

[2022-07-06T22:07:59] Mirko Boni: <animation>
[2022-07-06T22:08:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I think for most of us english is secondary language so some mistakes are ok ,and you have build in translator to correct 🤔

[2022-07-07T00:30:31] rosheee: the problem isn't disc
[2022-07-07T00:30:36] rosheee: disc is easy at going blue

[2022-07-07T00:34:24] rosheee: they fail
[2022-07-07T00:34:29] Mirono escooters: Y
[2022-07-07T00:34:32] rosheee: sealings not rubber
[2022-07-07T00:34:52] Tommy: You have to.go.to the sun? XD

[2022-07-07T00:35:27] Izuna 生活: Does someone know oil brake lever with hall sensor? I only found on-off brake lever for now.
[2022-07-07T00:35:39] rosheee: o.O
[2022-07-07T00:35:53] rosheee: ah ^^ 0-100 % brake lever lvl
[2022-07-07T00:36:13] Izuna 生活: Yes.
[2022-07-07T00:37:09] Unknown: DOT fluid in Magura or Shimano will eat the seals to shit
[2022-07-07T00:38:00] rosheee: ah don't u saya
[2022-07-07T00:38:02] Unknown: DOT fluid is Corrosive. Mineral oil is not. Magura/Shimano seals are silicone made for mineral oil
[2022-07-07T00:38:11] rosheee: which seals?
[2022-07-07T00:38:18] rosheee: navy?
[2022-07-07T00:38:22] Unknown: All of the piston and master cylinder internal seals
[2022-07-07T00:38:31] Unknown: That keeps the oil from leaking out of the system
[2022-07-07T00:38:37] Unknown: Essential seals lol
[2022-07-07T00:38:42] rosheee: nono
[2022-07-07T00:38:46] Unknown: Yes yes
[2022-07-07T00:38:54] rosheee: nono
[2022-07-07T00:39:04] rosheee: u took whole shizzl apart?
[2022-07-07T00:39:32] rosheee: the mt7 lever i send to the moon
[2022-07-07T00:39:44] Unknown: I took the piston out of the calipers... Master cylinder is not able to be taken apart but there are seals. How you think the fluid stays in 🤣
[2022-07-07T00:40:00] rosheee: hmm i thought it was vacuum
[2022-07-07T00:40:34] Unknown: Well the lever creates a vacuum in the system when pulled but SEALS keep the fluid in. How you think the pistons move and don't leak fluid?
[2022-07-07T00:40:56] rosheee: hmm are there no pillows inside
[2022-07-07T00:41:03] rosheee: when u press it push oil in pillows
[2022-07-07T00:41:10] rosheee: then they push the plastic pistons
[2022-07-07T00:41:15] Unknown: Silicone orings/seals
[2022-07-07T00:41:26] Unknown: Vacuum only move the pistons
[2022-07-07T00:41:34] Unknown: And they ride along orings
[2022-07-07T00:41:35] rosheee: but why isn't there a pillow
[2022-07-07T00:41:46] Unknown: Cuz Magura never sleeps
[2022-07-07T00:41:59] Unknown: Oh shit, see what I did there
[2022-07-07T00:42:50] Unknown: No. When pistons are removed from the caliper body, there are orings/seals that ride along the caliper body and make the seal so the fluid doesn't come out when you pressurize the system (pull the lever)
[2022-07-07T00:42:52] rosheee: buta dam
[2022-07-07T00:42:55] rosheee: adam
[2022-07-07T00:42:55] rosheee: 😃
[2022-07-07T00:43:01] rosheee: there is dot5
[2022-07-07T00:43:04] rosheee: u heard about it?
[2022-07-07T00:43:24] rosheee: DOT5 (silicone)
[2022-07-07T00:43:30] rosheee: so silicon fucks up silicon?
[2022-07-07T00:44:04] Unknown: <photos/photo_5289@07-07-2022_00-44-04.jpg>
[2022-07-07T00:44:27] Unknown: I hope you scrubbed all the mineral oil out of your brakes before adding the DOT5 or else now you got gel
[2022-07-07T00:44:41] rosheee: ofc
[2022-07-07T00:45:05] rosheee: XD otherwise i would use olive oil when not doing sum research before
[2022-07-07T00:45:15] rosheee: or the mcdonalds fries oil
[2022-07-07T00:45:17] rosheee: high temp
[2022-07-07T00:45:27] Unknown: <photos/photo_5290@07-07-2022_00-45-27.jpg>
[2022-07-07T00:45:39] Unknown: Haha... Peanut oil 👌
[2022-07-07T00:45:51] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-07-07T00:46:00] rosheee: there is also
[2022-07-07T00:46:02] rosheee: bionol
[2022-07-07T00:46:12] rosheee: 340degrees C i think
[2022-07-07T00:46:14] rosheee: or was it 180
[2022-07-07T00:46:19] Unknown: I just don't see why you wouldn't stick with mineral oil which the system seals and components are designed for
[2022-07-07T00:46:41] Unknown: If your brakes are getting hot enough to boil mineral oil, you probably have other issues
[2022-07-07T00:46:44] rosheee: OH SHIT
[2022-07-07T00:46:57] rosheee: yes brake 2 much downhill
[2022-07-07T00:46:59] rosheee: Trickstuff Bionol brake fluid is a brake oil developed in Germany and manufactured using a vegetable oil basis. It is obtained from rapeseed oil and is harmless to humans and the environment. The high boiling point makes it particularly suitable for use in biking. The Heinzelmann Bleedkit from Trickstuff is ideal for changing the brake fluid and also bleeding.
[2022-07-07T00:47:06] rosheee: - pure plant oil - toxin class free, low evaporation, not hazardous to water - completely biodegradable - boiling point is 420° C - maximum compressive strength - extremely thin
[2022-07-07T00:47:11] rosheee: mmmh bitch out with the dot5
[2022-07-07T00:47:20] Unknown: There ya go 👌
[2022-07-07T00:47:27] rosheee: Boiling Point The initial boiling point of Bionol is 300°C, the actual boiling point is 420°C. This is significantly higher than conventional mineral oil or DOT5.1.
[2022-07-07T00:47:37] rosheee: same as the brakediscs i use
[2022-07-07T00:47:42] Unknown: And non corrosive
[2022-07-07T00:47:48] Unknown: Yea trickstuff
[2022-07-07T00:47:51] rosheee: the mt8 is not made for sc00ters
[2022-07-07T00:47:58] Unknown: Probably $600/ml
[2022-07-07T00:48:00] Unknown: LoL
[2022-07-07T00:48:19] rosheee: no
[2022-07-07T00:48:25] rosheee: 100ml 9$
[2022-07-07T00:48:34] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-07-07T00:48:37] Unknown: Nope, single piston caliper is much smaller than dual piston caliper so much less heat dissipation due to caliper size / amount of metal
[2022-07-07T00:48:52] Unknown: I was kidding lol
[2022-07-07T00:48:54] rosheee: yah mt8 is rear
[2022-07-07T00:49:00] rosheee: front is "ok"
[2022-07-07T00:49:11] Unknown: That's why overheating probably
[2022-07-07T00:49:21] rosheee: front was also very h0tt0
[2022-07-07T00:49:41] rosheee: so all 2 weeks refill and take air out
[2022-07-07T00:49:55] rosheee: magura brakehose also feel crappy
[2022-07-07T00:50:05] Unknown: Jagwire pro lines are really nice
[2022-07-07T00:50:13] rosheee: yup
[2022-07-07T00:50:16] rosheee: that's the one i use in front
[2022-07-07T00:50:23] rosheee: u have to try..hmm
[2022-07-07T00:50:25] Unknown: Much better than Magura. I love my jagwire lines
[2022-07-07T00:50:28] rosheee: word
[2022-07-07T00:50:38] rosheee: there are sum ..damn 😆i send pics tomorrow
[2022-07-07T00:50:43] rosheee: XTR or something like that

[2022-07-07T00:59:59] rosheee: omfg 0100am goodn8
[2022-07-07T01:08:32] Unknown: Those look like 3 finger levers. I got the MT5 HCs, single finger aluminum levers. Beautiful
[2022-07-07T01:09:00] Mirono escooters: I want whole hand lever like on my scooter. I prefer it
[2022-07-07T01:09:03] Mirono escooters: Overcompensating
[2022-07-07T01:09:29] Unknown: These are awesome 1 finger levers. Super nice feel
[2022-07-07T01:09:29] Unknown: <photos/photo_5292@07-07-2022_01-09-29.jpg>

[2022-07-07T01:09:47] Tommy: Unfortunatly no sensor😭
[2022-07-07T01:10:01] Mirono escooters: I got the 2 finger format
[2022-07-07T01:10:02] Unknown: I really really like these 1 fingers. Can easy fit 2 fingers when beeded
[2022-07-07T01:10:05] Tommy: But the lever is way better than the sensored one
[2022-07-07T01:10:06] Mirono escooters: Still smoll but ill go with it
[2022-07-07T01:10:24] Unknown: Nope that's why you need variable Regen on a separate lever. Note the left handed trigger throttle for my variable Regen 👌
[2022-07-07T01:10:54] Mirono escooters: I got here a hydraulic brake with a super short cable, its from a bike. Can i lenghten hydraulic line? Is it universal?
[2022-07-07T01:11:21] Mirono escooters: It's super instant and a big lever, i like, just cant use it.
[2022-07-07T01:11:34] Unknown: <photos/photo_5294@07-07-2022_01-11-34.jpg>
[2022-07-07T01:11:53] Mirono escooters: Beautiful
[2022-07-07T01:12:23] Unknown: Absolutely. Just need the proper olive and barb to reassemble at lever side and caliper side
[2022-07-07T01:12:49] Mirono escooters: Olive barb?
[2022-07-07T01:12:55] Tommy: yes, this way you can use the e-brake, but is not the same thing, stop the motor when you brake is also a safety features
[2022-07-07T01:13:14] Mirono escooters: I vouch for seperate rthrottle as ebrake
[2022-07-07T01:13:51] Unknown: Yea.. ehh. For whimps 🤣

[2022-07-07T01:14:09] Unknown: Who gives throttle and brake at the same time and relies on the kill switch?
[2022-07-07T01:15:11] Unknown: You just need the proper olive and barb to fit your caliper/lever. There are some that are "universal" but best to try and find them by brand of your brakes if possible
[2022-07-07T01:16:20] Mirono escooters: China brand, so i should check
[2022-07-07T01:16:27] Unknown: You can add a hall sensor and magnet to the levers for homemade variable Regen levers... To any lever. Or you can use a reed switch with magnet to trigger kill switch. Or you can install the bafang sensor and magnet as a kill switch
[2022-07-07T01:18:53] Unknown: There are many way to create a kill switch or switching type Regen on typical levers. Levers with sensors are so limited. Basically Nutt, zoom, Logan (maybe) and mt5e with 3 finger lever
[2022-07-07T01:23:42] Tommy: That would be cool
[2022-07-07T01:24:49] Tommy: With magura regen is useless more or less, i Need just a safety features But yes you want ti use the e-brake a hall Is way better
[2022-07-07T01:25:51] Unknown: <video_file>
[2022-07-07T01:25:55] Unknown: @Tommy526
[2022-07-07T01:26:34] Unknown: Here is guy who made variable Regen on his Hope levers using a simple hall sensor and magnet
[2022-07-07T01:27:16] rosheee: No prob
[2022-07-07T07:15:09] Gigolo Joe: Wat ze fuck? Does work better?
[2022-07-07T07:23:00] rosheee: No

[2022-07-07T12:52:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Will kill oil ring
[2022-07-07T12:54:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If your brake's keep heating up , that's abnormal ,do you e brake also? If you brake a lot with oil brake and disc is small you can overheat, nothing you can do Or maybe get bigger disc ,but to be honest on this lvl thicker would helps more🤷‍♂
[2022-07-07T12:55:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Farly not
[2022-07-07T12:55:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If its not dedicated ,oil rings will die soon
[2022-07-07T12:57:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well 🤷‍♂ atleast you can buy another😁
[2022-07-07T13:06:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: On nutt you can change cut off to sensor more easy maybe
[2022-07-07T13:08:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You can get little motherfucker out from here and use better one, like ss494b was tried
[2022-07-07T13:42:39] Unknown: I have ubox v2 75v100a x2, where should I insert Bluetooth adapter in it?
[2022-07-07T13:48:46] sombre_enfant: Fit on shimano maître cylindre ?
[2022-07-07T13:49:00] sombre_enfant: On your master

[2022-07-07T13:55:08] Unknown: And why master
[2022-07-07T14:05:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Shortly yes
[2022-07-07T14:05:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He means if you have the dual ,bt is on master

[2022-07-07T14:45:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It will be a long road ,read a bit
[2022-07-07T14:50:08] Unknown: 🤦 just mark on photo the connector if for sure you used this controller with Bluetooth
[2022-07-07T14:55:22] Face de Pin Sucé: To help you, we need you to show us that you're looking by yourself
[2022-07-07T14:55:39] Face de Pin Sucé: Come on, it's not that difficult to read a wiring diagram provided on the official website
[2022-07-07T15:03:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: As i already said ,normaly u buy this with Bluetooth inside if you plan to use one, so how about telling which you have Before you try to connect something what's already done indise ,how do we should know what you have 🤷‍♂ MR.🤦‍♂
[2022-07-07T15:04:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well if the oil tube is the same size ,than should be ,i didn't tried
[2022-07-07T15:06:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also there is way more interesting to have adc if you dont have spintends other solutions,but this is regarding what you build 🤷

[2022-07-07T23:21:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well i seen similar on an external battery cable what has damaged in an accident ,cables isolation has damaged several places and shorted External was removed when i first saw it and imagine ,internal bms was in a short and shot all down till I removed stupid cable ,only thing left undamaged was the fuse
[2022-07-07T23:23:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There can be cases this may help but mostly i dont think so
[2022-07-07T23:26:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤔 if you dont have battery to make that load no use of it , if you can make more ,no use of it like this 🤷‍♂

[2022-07-07T23:40:27] Izuna 生活: Yes, I made it more accurate. It was off real bad. It is not 100% perfect I think, but good enough.
[2022-07-07T23:43:43] Izuna 生活: @lBabacar the m365_dash.lisp that I sent you is custom for you, because of your dual motor with CAN. For single motor use this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m365fw/vesc_m365ble/m365_dash/res/Lisp/Examples/m365_dash.lisp

[2022-07-08T11:32:22] ×ＡＯＲＵＳ×: but there's .lisp
[2022-07-08T12:12:01] Izuna 生活: No, use the .7z, it includes the required tool and firmwares.
[2022-07-08T12:12:38] Izuna 生活: The .lisp is for m365 dashboard compatibility and requires the newer fw version to be used.
[2022-07-08T12:12:53] ×ＡＯＲＵＳ×: can I please have the instructions
[2022-07-08T12:13:05] Izuna 生活: one sec
[2022-07-08T12:13:12] ×ＡＯＲＵＳ×: Thanks
[2022-07-08T12:13:18] ×ＡＯＲＵＳ×: Very much
[2022-07-08T12:13:27] Izuna 生活: (VESC firmware update) 1. Open the VESC tool in the 7z 2. Connect to VESC (might show errors about motor config deserialization etc ignore it) 3. Go to Firmware 4. Click on Bootloader -> select "generic" or something -> press the button with the downwards showing arrow 5. Wait a few seconds and reconnect (it will restart probably) 6. Go to Custom File -> Select "VESC_default.bin" file from "75_100_V2_no_limits" folder -> press the button with the downwards showing arrow 5. Wait a few seconds and reconnect (it will restart probably) 7. Now you can start using the VESC (Basic VESC usage) 1. Connect 2. Press "Setup Motors FOC" and follow the setup guide 3. Choose direction and let it spin around 4. See realtime data with "RT" button on the right side bar and control motor with arrow keys with arrowkeys button on the right side bar
[2022-07-08T12:13:40] ×ＡＯＲＵＳ×: Thanks 🙏
[2022-07-08T12:14:21] ×ＡＯＲＵＳ×: and what to do with ble?
[2022-07-08T12:14:40] Izuna 生活: The xiaomi BLE?
[2022-07-08T12:16:00] ×ＡＯＲＵＳ×: Yes
[2022-07-08T12:16:08] ×ＡＯＲＵＳ×: (Ninebot))
[2022-07-08T12:16:44] Izuna 生活: That is fairly simple. Wire it up correctly (red=5V black=GND yellow=COM-TX (UART-HDX) green=COM-RX (button)+3.3V with R470 Resistor and capacitor), copy content of the link that I replied to, go to the lisp section in Vesc tool, paste it in and you are ready to go
[2022-07-08T12:17:05] Izuna 生活: You can ask @lBabacar about wiring, he has done it on the NineBot.
[2022-07-08T12:17:23] ×ＡＯＲＵＳ×: Ok 👍
[2022-07-08T12:18:00] ×ＡＯＲＵＳ×: through the stlink program?
[2022-07-08T12:19:25] Izuna 生活: Noo

[2022-07-08T12:52:19] Ofek 🐥: What about heat dissipation 😱 Isn't metal tab better?
[2022-07-08T12:52:55] Кирилл: Ncep is pretty good
[2022-07-08T12:57:08] Mirono escooters: Bottom is metal..
[2022-07-08T12:57:49] Ofek 🐥: 👌👌 Opened datasheet, they are good
[2022-07-08T12:58:21] Paolo ⁭: is the best package for heat dissipation
[2022-07-08T12:58:43] Jan: What metal is it?
[2022-07-08T12:58:48] Paolo ⁭: you've too hole for fix with big surface directly
[2022-07-08T12:59:13] Ofek 🐥: I thought I saw TO-220, my bad 🙈
[2022-07-08T12:59:17] Paolo ⁭: if you've like hsof 8 package like spintend is much more complicated to be cooled
[2022-07-08T12:59:25] Jan: Aluminium?
[2022-07-08T12:59:47] Paolo ⁭: copper plated nickel i thimk
[2022-07-08T12:59:58] Jan: Ah then its fine
[2022-07-08T12:59:59] Paolo ⁭: nickel plated copper
[2022-07-08T13:00:43] Paolo ⁭: yes in the fact with same rdson you've lower temp than hsof8 package
[2022-07-08T13:00:47] Mirono escooters: If you got a dead mosfet, cut it open its super interesting
[2022-07-08T13:01:31] Jan: Tronic250 has 6 mosfet. Whats the heat output under 7-8kW load?
[2022-07-08T13:01:49] Mirono escooters: Alot, xd
[2022-07-08T13:02:14] Jan: If anyone has a number or an mosfet efficiency, please share
[2022-07-08T13:04:49] Ofek 🐥: <files/NCEP01T30T datasheet.pdf>
[2022-07-08T13:29:40] Jan: 520W max power dissipation? At what power?
[2022-07-08T13:30:44] Jan: 100V & 300A max?
[2022-07-08T13:31:10] Jan: Would result in 98% efficiency
[2022-07-08T13:32:03] Jan: Would result in 140W heat at 8kW for the Tronic250. Plausible? Looks a bit low to me
[2022-07-08T13:37:12] Кирилл: Its around 110-120A continious with 20s i.e
[2022-07-08T13:37:31] Кирилл: amperes heats
[2022-07-08T13:38:49] Кирилл: but yeah, need good heatsink
[2022-07-08T13:57:09] Jan: Can design that if i have numbers
[2022-07-08T14:07:48] Jan: Tronic250 has 6 mosfets resulting in 8kW output. Whats the generated heat in Watts?
[2022-07-08T14:09:52] Jan: 20s yes
[2022-07-08T14:10:17] Jan: Will result indeed in 110-120A on all 6 mosfets
[2022-07-08T14:10:23] Jan: So 20A per mosfet
[2022-07-08T14:10:57] Mirono escooters: Can we just divide that by 6?..

[2022-07-10T00:36:51] Unknown: Can probably handle 80a with tripping BMS or harming the cells in short bursts
[2022-07-10T00:37:47] Unknown: 78a battery with stock Vsett battery.. if I remember correctly was approx. 40a rear and 38a front. Phase was 175 rear and like 120 front... Just from memory when I had the stock battery. But range on 25.6ah was under 20 miles per charge 🤣
[2022-07-10T00:38:25] rosheee: it should go harder than 5P 50G
[2022-07-10T00:38:28] Unknown: You can play with phase ampa
[2022-07-10T00:38:56] Unknown: No. LG mh1 or mj1 cells. 7-12a max. 8p. Plus stock BMS is... Who knows
[2022-07-10T00:39:32] Unknown: If you want to cook your battery cells, then yea
[2022-07-10T00:39:45] rosheee: if he sets voltage cut correct = no prob
[2022-07-10T00:39:51] Mirono escooters: Roschee wants
[2022-07-10T00:39:52] Unknown: But then BMS might trip at or over 80a
[2022-07-10T00:39:56] Unknown: Always
[2022-07-10T00:40:07] Paolo ⁭: Someone here want test high torque motor for wolf ?
[2022-07-10T00:40:49] Unknown: No regard for cells or safety 🤷🏻‍♂️ Especially if you're selling the battery with new battery on the way. Would not be cool to cook it and then sell it
[2022-07-10T00:41:03] rosheee: i sold mys 16S5P as well
[2022-07-10T00:41:15] rosheee: 😃 but anyway
[2022-07-10T00:41:22] Unknown: Great. James is asking about the stock Vsett battery
[2022-07-10T00:41:23] rosheee: gonna be max 50a battery amps now
[2022-07-10T00:41:59] rosheee: lg mj1 10A current
[2022-07-10T00:41:59] Unknown: I gave him my suggestion since I had that battery
[2022-07-10T00:42:01] sombre_enfant: 🤨🤨🧑🏾‍🌾
[2022-07-10T00:42:05] Mirono escooters: Price will be oof
[2022-07-10T00:42:18] Unknown: Yes, in 8p
[2022-07-10T00:42:20] Unknown: 80a
[2022-07-10T00:42:22] rosheee: yes
[2022-07-10T00:42:23] Unknown: Just as I said
[2022-07-10T00:42:24] rosheee: so 80A
[2022-07-10T00:42:31] rosheee: i do 50a
[2022-07-10T00:42:40] rosheee: so his should be more fuckeria
[2022-07-10T00:44:12] Unknown: james
[2022-07-10T00:44:12] Unknown: 78a battery with stock Vsett battery.. if I remember correctly was approx. 40a rear and 38a front. Phase was 175 rear and like 120 front... Just from memory when I had the stock battery. But range on 25.6ah was under 20 miles per charge 🤣
[2022-07-10T00:44:18] Unknown: james
[2022-07-10T00:45:56] Artem Bulashev: I would not advise above 8amp - sag is too large, over 10%.
[2022-07-10T00:46:11] rosheee: yah and then sag stops at 48V
[2022-07-10T00:47:26] Unknown: Yes for sure. Riding my 25.6ah at 78a was definitely pushing it a bit lol. Sag and range were not happy
[2022-07-10T00:48:57] Mirono escooters: Under 20 miles?? 😂
[2022-07-10T00:49:33] Artem Bulashev: VSETT stock in sports - 70a - on mh1 mj1, sag already too large. At 60a it is ok, but at 70a too much
[2022-07-10T00:49:49] rosheee: lol ^^'
[2022-07-10T00:50:04] rosheee: then u have sag to 3V per cell
[2022-07-10T00:50:46] Artem Bulashev: Not that much on 70a
[2022-07-10T00:51:06] rosheee: yeh
[2022-07-10T00:51:18] Artem Bulashev: But around 15%
[2022-07-10T00:51:20] rosheee: when he set volt cut correct then all cells go down to 3V
[2022-07-10T00:51:34] Artem Bulashev: Around 4.2v -> 3.6v
[2022-07-10T00:53:15] rosheee: yah i set 47V
[2022-07-10T00:53:27] rosheee: 2.9375V
[2022-07-10T00:53:32] rosheee: i had 44V sometimes lol
[2022-07-10T00:58:50] Unknown: Usually 2-3x is typical. I would start at like 160 rear and 120 front and go up from there til you have good acceleration
[2022-07-10T01:05:15] Unknown: The battery amps right now are your limiting factor so you'll need to exceed the 2-3x ratio to get good power on FOC with similar battery amps
[2022-07-10T01:12:52] Artem Bulashev: Doesn’t matter. What ever your motor can handle
[2022-07-10T01:13:39] rosheee: 135A is enough ^^
[2022-07-10T01:13:42] rosheee: per motor
[2022-07-10T01:14:50] rosheee: 400a phase and 30a batterx
[2022-07-10T01:14:51] Artem Bulashev: Motor heat = phase amps * time it lasts at full Time it lasts full is defined by battery amps limit, because it is like Watt limit on Input. Battery amp limit * battery voltage
[2022-07-10T01:14:51] rosheee: *lol3
[2022-07-10T01:15:03] rosheee: and phase ^^?
[2022-07-10T01:15:08] rosheee: what does phase
[2022-07-10T01:15:47] Artem Bulashev: Phase amps is like output Amp limit
[2022-07-10T01:16:03] rosheee: and what he should set max current?
[2022-07-10T01:16:14] Artem Bulashev: Motor voltage is output voltage
[2022-07-10T01:16:22] Unknown: I believe they're 10+ motors. They handle more than the ubox can deliver on 20s, so on 16s there is no worry of too high phase amps for the motors themselves
[2022-07-10T01:16:22] Artem Bulashev: Together they = to output Watts
[2022-07-10T01:16:31] rosheee: so if i set now 220A phase and 60 A batter
[2022-07-10T01:16:37] Artem Bulashev: Output can not be more than Input
[2022-07-10T01:16:41] rosheee: it should go 15kw?
[2022-07-10T01:16:54] Artem Bulashev: Will never
[2022-07-10T01:17:06] rosheee: with 2x 135A i get like 10kw
[2022-07-10T01:17:11] Artem Bulashev: 60a * battery voltage is the max you will do
[2022-07-10T01:17:18] rosheee: XD
[2022-07-10T01:17:21] rosheee: ok
[2022-07-10T01:17:25] rosheee: so the 10kw i had are illusion
[2022-07-10T01:17:27] rosheee: and the 9kw
[2022-07-10T01:17:31] Unknown: I don't think phase amps play into output wattage
[2022-07-10T01:17:42] rosheee: idk it rly 2 be honest
[2022-07-10T01:17:52] Artem Bulashev: Phase amps * motor voltage = output watts
[2022-07-10T01:18:13] Unknown: So how does battery amps play into output wattage?
[2022-07-10T01:18:21] Artem Bulashev: Point when phase amps get reduced is the point where it gets to Battery amp limit * battery voltage
[2022-07-10T01:18:34] Paolo ⁭: Nami/wolf is 55A 200A phase
[2022-07-10T01:18:50] rosheee: <photos/photo_5317@10-07-2022_01-18-50.jpg>
[2022-07-10T01:18:57] Unknown: Ahhh.. right right. It's coming back to me now.. phase amps are dictated by battery amps... Well they have a relationship. Not "dictated" but the relationship as they raise and fall together
[2022-07-10T01:20:04] rosheee: 171a for both motors lol
[2022-07-10T01:20:41] Unknown: @artBula ... On 72v my rear 10+ motor was set to 80a batt and 225a phase. But max phase pulled was 218a I believe...
[2022-07-10T01:20:44] Artem Bulashev: You can not produce more watts on output, than you have on InPut. Never So controller adjusts the only variable it has control over - phase amps, to keep output watts at maximum = input watts available.
[2022-07-10T01:20:54] Artem Bulashev: Correct
[2022-07-10T01:21:43] Artem Bulashev: They never get one to one but it approaches battery voltage yes. (In the air motor volts are = to battery voltage)
[2022-07-10T01:22:20] rosheee: <photos/photo_5318@10-07-2022_01-22-20.jpg>
[2022-07-10T01:22:24] rosheee: this with 16S
[2022-07-10T01:23:06] Artem Bulashev: Yeah and only at the beginning, around 5kmh - it takes a sec form phase amps to jump from 0 to max. Than they reduce once Phase amps * motor voltage > battery amp lim * battery voltage
[2022-07-10T01:24:21] Artem Bulashev: Relation starts only once motor watts (phase amps * motor volt) is about to be larger than battery watts
[2022-07-10T01:25:22] Paolo ⁭: Now I get why your TRONIC don’t heat
[2022-07-10T01:25:28] rosheee: this is ubox
[2022-07-10T01:25:30] rosheee: <photos/photo_5319@10-07-2022_01-25-30.jpg>
[2022-07-10T01:25:33] rosheee: ubox cool as fuck
[2022-07-10T01:25:36] Paolo ⁭: Same thing
[2022-07-10T01:25:36] Unknown: <photos/photo_5320@10-07-2022_01-25-36.jpg>
[2022-07-10T01:25:36] Unknown: <photos/photo_5321@10-07-2022_01-25-36.jpg>
[2022-07-10T01:25:36] Artem Bulashev: High phase will punch more around 5kmh, and will have longer curve, but it will end up at same level (slope) as lower phase setting) if battery limit is same
[2022-07-10T01:25:37] Unknown: <photos/photo_5322@10-07-2022_01-25-37.jpg>

[2022-07-10T01:25:39] Unknown: <photos/photo_5326@10-07-2022_01-25-39.jpg>
[2022-07-10T01:25:47] Artem Bulashev: Thanks for finding those
[2022-07-10T01:26:01] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5327@10-07-2022_01-26-01.jpg>
[2022-07-10T01:26:05] Artem Bulashev: Here is example
[2022-07-10T01:26:11] Artem Bulashev: Of only phase amps change
[2022-07-10T01:26:15] rosheee: then field weakening comes in
[2022-07-10T01:26:27] rosheee: and u go 7-8kw at 80-99
[2022-07-10T01:26:45] Artem Bulashev: It adds amps
[2022-07-10T01:26:50] Artem Bulashev: No magic
[2022-07-10T01:26:57] Unknown: Can be LOTS of amps
[2022-07-10T01:27:06] Artem Bulashev: It basically emulates higher KV motor
[2022-07-10T01:27:24] rosheee: 32C degrees ambient
[2022-07-10T01:27:34] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-07-10T01:28:00] Paolo ⁭: How temperature increase fast
[2022-07-10T01:28:12] rosheee: Yah because battery is warm
[2022-07-10T01:28:13] Unknown: Yes. Reduces the magnetic field to allow stator to spin faster. Somehow consumes a lot of amps by doing so
[2022-07-10T01:28:18] rosheee: That is after 10km
[2022-07-10T01:28:46] Paolo ⁭: Stop message
[2022-07-10T01:28:53] Artem Bulashev: Lowers efficiency by about 1/4
[2022-07-10T01:28:53] Paolo ⁭: Design pls
[2022-07-10T01:28:57] Artem Bulashev: That’s why more amps
[2022-07-10T01:29:20] Unknown: Hmm. Interesting. In a way it is sort of magic LoL 😆
[2022-07-10T01:29:46] Artem Bulashev: Science that one doesn’t understand is magic 😄
[2022-07-10T01:30:09] Unknown: I sort of understand it, which is why it is sort of magic to me haha
[2022-07-10T01:31:03] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-07-10T01:31:26] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2022-07-10T01:31:26] Unknown: Crash with car 😬
[2022-07-10T01:31:57] Artem Bulashev: saw it earlier today, that is the first actually broken stem I saw 😂
[2022-07-10T01:32:17] Artem Bulashev: Sounded like guy is done with scooting - afraid to do it
[2022-07-10T01:32:27] Paolo ⁭: There are now much more post of vsett 9 broken
[2022-07-10T01:32:38] Unknown: Yea same here. Saw it and was like, oh shit. Then realized it was an accident involving a car
[2022-07-10T01:33:27] Unknown: Yup. Crashing bad can be eye opening. I'm still not right from 15mph crash in my driveway 🤣
[2022-07-10T01:33:35] Unknown: 10+?
[2022-07-10T01:34:05] rosheee: Wait xD
[2022-07-10T01:34:14] Unknown: Oh gotcha... Is the new battery for the 9 or 10?
[2022-07-10T01:34:36] Unknown: Oh ok... Thought so lol
[2022-07-10T01:35:18] Unknown: Indeed. Was just confused for second
[2022-07-10T01:36:12] Unknown: I do too. Next time I pull my battery I'll probably change the footrest bolts to something stronger but honestly haven't had an issues with mine at all. Going on around 1200 miles on the scooter
[2022-07-10T01:36:35] Unknown: It's happened a few times. Honestly, I don't really have any concerns about it
[2022-07-10T01:37:51] Unknown: I think some people use the footrest harder than others. Would definitely suck to break while riding since the rear shock is mounted to it
[2022-07-10T01:38:38] Unknown: Would just be a matter of googling screw steel types. There is automotive grade. Hardness scale type thing
[2022-07-10T01:40:41] Unknown: <photos/photo_5328@10-07-2022_01-40-41.jpg>
[2022-07-10T01:41:09] Unknown: They definitely do. I just retightened mine a few days ago and the 2 outer screws were hand tight at best
[2022-07-10T01:51:51] rosheee: @artBula
[2022-07-10T03:42:40] rosheee: How fast 1/4mile bois?
[2022-07-10T04:09:35] Artem Bulashev: Have not seen any, May be 1 in past month
[2022-07-10T04:09:44] rosheee: yo u want now ferro fuid?
[2022-07-10T04:10:54] rosheee: i asked now 10x
[2022-07-10T04:10:56] rosheee: u never answer omfg
[2022-07-10T04:11:20] Artem Bulashev: Just get new assembly under warrenty
[2022-07-10T04:11:36] rosheee: @artBula YO
[2022-07-10T04:12:27] Artem Bulashev: Hi
[2022-07-10T04:12:37] rosheee: omg
[2022-07-10T04:12:38] Artem Bulashev: I replied in group about a 3 weeks ago
[2022-07-10T04:12:41] rosheee: u want ferro fluid now xD?
[2022-07-10T04:12:43] rosheee: XD i asked
[2022-07-10T04:12:46] rosheee: again
[2022-07-10T04:12:49] Artem Bulashev: Said to ship together to James and Oliver
[2022-07-10T04:12:52] rosheee: aha
[2022-07-10T04:12:55] rosheee: to sweden o.O?
[2022-07-10T04:12:56] Artem Bulashev: Sorry :)
[2022-07-10T04:13:09] Artem Bulashev: Yeah said multiple times I believe
[2022-07-10T04:13:11] rosheee: ok
[2022-07-10T04:13:16] rosheee: then send moneycash for 20ml
[2022-07-10T04:14:06] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2022-07-10T04:14:13] Artem Bulashev: There was only 10ml for me
[2022-07-10T04:14:18] Artem Bulashev: 😅😅
[2022-07-10T04:14:26] rosheee: ah sry
[2022-07-10T04:14:30] Artem Bulashev: No probs
[2022-07-10T04:14:31] rosheee: yah then epic fail
[2022-07-10T04:14:41] Artem Bulashev: Have you shipped to them ?
[2022-07-10T04:14:44] rosheee: XD i go to post office monday cuz izt is still there
[2022-07-10T04:14:44] rosheee: yes
[2022-07-10T04:14:58] rosheee: but they pick up monday
[2022-07-10T04:15:17] Artem Bulashev: Unlikely for them to cooperate with you
[2022-07-10T04:15:24] Artem Bulashev: But sure
[2022-07-10T04:15:32] rosheee: swiss post xD
[2022-07-10T04:15:37] rosheee: why?
[2022-07-10T04:16:25] rosheee: they closed the office here so it is a bakery
[2022-07-10T04:16:34] Artem Bulashev: 😄😄😄
[2022-07-10T04:16:38] Artem Bulashev: Ok than May be

[2022-07-10T15:22:10] rosheee: hoyl fuck XD
[2022-07-10T15:22:13] rosheee: 4 piston
[2022-07-10T15:22:13] Mirono escooters: Isnt that normal
[2022-07-10T15:22:17] rosheee: lol?
[2022-07-10T15:22:18] Mirono escooters: Magura has kits for that
[2022-07-10T15:22:20] rosheee: rofl
[2022-07-10T15:22:23] rosheee: magura has 0 official kits
[2022-07-10T15:22:32] Mirono escooters: Ok
[2022-07-10T15:22:41] rosheee: which u know who can do that?
[2022-07-10T15:22:43] rosheee: officially?
[2022-07-10T15:22:49] Mirono escooters: My friend did. Idk
[2022-07-10T15:22:51] rosheee: lol
[2022-07-10T15:23:00] rosheee: people struggle soo hardcore for that
[2022-07-10T15:23:10] rosheee: there are so many XD
[2022-07-10T15:23:19] rosheee: it's 1 keyword lol

[2022-07-10T15:42:50] rosheee: show u next week
[2022-07-10T15:43:08] rosheee: i ordered 4 different systems by 4 dif. manufacturers
[2022-07-10T15:43:51] rosheee: reflash firmware + bootloader
[2022-07-10T15:44:07] rosheee: if doesn't work contact spintend had same issue logicboard issue
[2022-07-10T16:41:57] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_5329@10-07-2022_16-41-57.jpg>
[2022-07-10T16:42:01] Mirono escooters: Fixable? 😐
[2022-07-10T16:42:14] Mirono escooters: Loads of water.. moves almost nothing with pull of lever
[2022-07-10T16:47:58] Ofek 🐥: I would start with removing the pads and spraying WD-40 and brushing
[2022-07-10T16:48:41] Mirono escooters: Wd40? Silicon oil? Ptfe oil?
[2022-07-10T16:50:36] Ofek 🐥: They will not do anything to the rust
[2022-07-10T16:51:56] Mirono escooters: Ok
[2022-07-10T16:52:20] Mirono escooters: Hope seals ok. Brakes shiuld handle water but it was alot
[2022-07-10T16:59:52] Ofek 🐥: Just searched on google, better to use brake cleaner than wd40, it may damage seals
[2022-07-10T17:00:28] Mirono escooters: Ok. Will find
[2022-07-10T17:03:18] Mirono escooters: Ptfe should be fine, one of the better it seems
[2022-07-10T17:12:04] rosheee: brake cleaner doesn't fuck it seals xD?
[2022-07-10T17:12:18] rosheee: lol xD?
[2022-07-10T17:12:29] Mirono escooters: Dont ask.
[2022-07-10T17:12:59] rosheee: u were fishing? shimanofish?
[2022-07-10T17:14:19] Mirono escooters: It was in a box.. and apperantly rain got in..
[2022-07-10T17:14:27] Mirono escooters: Buttt it was broken before but i wanna fix it
[2022-07-10T17:24:26] D J: what is the difference to the original?60V1200w
[2022-07-10T17:25:00] Кирилл: Low kv
[2022-07-10T17:26:23] D J: G30?
[2022-07-10T17:26:42] rosheee: yus
[2022-07-10T17:26:58] rosheee: hope fastride can send my controllers this week that i can rebuild kaabo
[2022-07-10T17:27:14] rosheee: for some reason only front light works
[2022-07-10T17:27:19] rosheee: idk what happened to the other lights
[2022-07-10T17:43:25] Paolo ⁭: Are 2000w
[2022-07-10T17:50:37] Gigolo Joe: Both brake cleaner and wd40 can fuck up the seals Better to use metal degreaser
[2022-07-10T17:52:29] Mirono escooters: Ok ptfe
[2022-07-10T18:23:02] D J: Same king GT?
[2022-07-10T18:25:07] Paolo ⁭: Outside yes, but high torque winding
[2022-07-10T19:32:51] Happy Giraffe: But lower amps🌚
[2022-07-10T19:41:03] rosheee: Yes
[2022-07-10T19:43:22] D J: How much top speed?

[2022-07-11T01:09:04] Paolo ⁭: Tried
[2022-07-11T01:09:12] Paolo ⁭: Magura mdr p is more Suce
[2022-07-11T01:11:58] rosheee: fack mdrp
[2022-07-11T01:12:07] rosheee: instant gave it away free
[2022-07-11T01:12:24] rosheee: u want storm hc 180mm?
[2022-07-11T01:13:04] Mirko Boni: No Roger! Magura mdr-p are great! Why do not you like them?
[2022-07-11T01:13:05] Mirono escooters: Y best
[2022-07-11T01:16:37] rosheee: they feel cheap
[2022-07-11T01:16:44] rosheee: and not sucé 0.01mm straight
[2022-07-11T01:17:38] Mirko Boni: I have installed magura mdr-p in my e-bikes and those of my friends! I never had problems!
[2022-07-11T01:17:55] rosheee: don't talk about problems
[2022-07-11T01:18:01] rosheee: anyone want storm hc 180mm?
[2022-07-11T01:18:11] Mirko Boni: In my opinion they have the best braking in the mtb market
[2022-07-11T01:19:07] rosheee: true
[2022-07-11T01:24:44] Paolo ⁭: Send me when I buy something from u
[2022-07-11T01:37:58] rosheee: i only can sell my body
[2022-07-11T06:04:55] rosheee: oii
[2022-07-11T06:05:09] rosheee: if nobody know or didn't so far set zero vector frequency to 20khz
[2022-07-11T06:05:13] rosheee: = more torque less heat
[2022-07-11T06:06:30] rosheee: ^^
[2022-07-11T06:07:33] rosheee: cuz electromagnetic field is str0nger
[2022-07-11T06:07:35] rosheee: <photos/photo_5331@11-07-2022_06-07-35.jpg>
[2022-07-11T06:10:13] rosheee: here comparison
[2022-07-11T06:12:03] rosheee: fuckeria stays c00l ubox v1
[2022-07-11T06:46:49] Gigolo Joe: Can go as low as 16khz
[2022-07-11T06:47:04] rosheee: Zeh more b00st
[2022-07-11T07:54:49] sombre_enfant: Wich section is that param ?
[2022-07-11T07:54:58] rosheee: Sec0nd
[2022-07-11T07:55:25] rosheee: <photos/photo_5334@11-07-2022_07-55-25.jpg>
[2022-07-11T07:55:52] Artem Bulashev: Higher frequency is more efficient
[2022-07-11T07:56:13] sombre_enfant: Create more heat
[2022-07-11T07:56:16] rosheee: Rather have more boost
[2022-07-11T07:56:25] rosheee: 1.5kw difference
[2022-07-11T07:56:25] Artem Bulashev: On fets
[2022-07-11T07:56:26] sombre_enfant: Motor less louder
[2022-07-11T07:56:34] Artem Bulashev: But motor is colder
[2022-07-11T07:56:37] sombre_enfant: But dont need that
[2022-07-11T07:57:03] Artem Bulashev: Lower frequency is exactly what Normal controllers are using
[2022-07-11T07:57:11] sombre_enfant: Max duty 99?
[2022-07-11T07:57:19] Artem Bulashev: More punch / power, hot motor, pounder motor
[2022-07-11T07:57:25] rosheee: I set 96%
[2022-07-11T07:57:35] rosheee: Moto feels better
[2022-07-11T07:58:11] sombre_enfant: I ride 44km per day for work fet go to 70c
[2022-07-11T07:58:42] sombre_enfant: On 13s and 35/100 30/80
[2022-07-11T07:58:58] Artem Bulashev: Strange
[2022-07-11T07:59:17] Artem Bulashev: Why it is so hot on such low settings ?
[2022-07-11T07:59:22] sombre_enfant: 22km at max duty in one time
[2022-07-11T07:59:46] sombre_enfant: High kv motor im at 55-60kph gps whole time
[2022-07-11T08:00:16] Artem Bulashev: Is 60kmh your max speed ?
[2022-07-11T08:00:38] Artem Bulashev: Still
[2022-07-11T08:00:51] sombre_enfant: Yes around this could go more if i had amps but battery heat too much
[2022-07-11T08:01:05] Artem Bulashev: I have same settings on my vsett 9
[2022-07-11T08:01:16] Artem Bulashev: My fets were never above 48c
[2022-07-11T08:01:20] sombre_enfant: Low kv motor and 16s
[2022-07-11T08:01:28] Artem Bulashev: Ubox dual 75v
[2022-07-11T08:01:39] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-07-11T08:01:50] Artem Bulashev: Top speed also 62kmh on 16s
[2022-07-11T08:02:15] Artem Bulashev: How big is your motor ?
[2022-07-11T08:02:24] rosheee: Lol wtf
[2022-07-11T08:02:33] sombre_enfant: If i go 16s with enough amps + field weakening i could reach 90-100kph
[2022-07-11T08:02:40] sombre_enfant: 50mm
[2022-07-11T08:02:40] Artem Bulashev: Yeah very low kv 😎
[2022-07-11T08:02:51] Artem Bulashev: Perfect as I don’t need more than 55kmh
[2022-07-11T08:02:51] rosheee: Vsett motor no prob go 90
[2022-07-11T08:02:58] sombre_enfant: Im not using field weakening
[2022-07-11T08:03:00] sombre_enfant: Rn
[2022-07-11T08:03:01] rosheee: With 16S 100kmh with FW
[2022-07-11T08:03:12] Paolo ⁭: Not always
[2022-07-11T08:03:19] Artem Bulashev: 10+ yes, mine is 650w 9+
[2022-07-11T08:03:40] Artem Bulashev: It is made for 48kmh at 52v battery
[2022-07-11T08:03:49] rosheee: Phuu
[2022-07-11T08:03:53] Paolo ⁭: The good compromise is 16-18khz
[2022-07-11T08:04:00] rosheee: @artem look PM
[2022-07-11T08:05:16] sombre_enfant: Look i try 16khz and tell you when im at work the max temps recorded
[2022-07-11T08:25:21] sombre_enfant: I was at 30khz i lowered the abs from 150 to 120 too
[2022-07-11T09:23:35] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_5335@11-07-2022_09-23-35.jpg>
[2022-07-11T09:23:46] sombre_enfant: 20c-
[2022-07-11T10:10:11] Paolo ⁭: Inox heatsink
[2022-07-11T10:21:03] rosheee: Top
[2022-07-11T10:26:32] Happy Giraffe: Super cooled mosfet with high khz should be best no?🤔
[2022-07-11T10:40:29] Кирилл: 20-25kHz real pwm is already more than enough. In vesc when you set 30 or 40kHz it means it needs to be divided by 2 (look info box). So 15-20kHz pwm actually
[2022-07-11T10:41:28] Кирилл: I set 25-30kHz here. So my motors and pwm have 12.5-15kHz
[2022-07-11T10:43:55] Кирилл: 40kHz freq (20kHz pwm) - too much heat, need a lot of cooling and its best for motors ofc
[2022-07-11T11:06:44] rosheee: you might want to cool the drv chip as it might get hotter than at 20khz. Just a small copper heatsink with some silicone pad.
[2022-07-11T11:07:16] rosheee: high kv motors need higher frequency
[2022-07-11T11:07:43] rosheee: A final point here would be to look at the R-L characteristics of your motor. Your motor windings have a time constant 12 (Just divide motor winding inductance by motor resistance) so at a certain switching frequency (about (10x time constant)^-1) it doesn’t much matter if you switch any faster because the motor winding current can’t physically change any quicker.
[2022-07-11T11:09:02] rosheee: hi
[2022-07-11T11:09:02] Juice: Hi
[2022-07-11T11:09:27] Juice: Im about to receive a ubox v2
[2022-07-11T11:09:52] Juice: But im wondering if vedder's source code is compatible with ubox
[2022-07-11T11:10:07] rosheee: ^^'?
[2022-07-11T11:10:07] Juice: I saw it has target for uboxes but nowhere on sprintend do they talk about it
[2022-07-11T11:10:20] rosheee: it's the same code
[2022-07-11T11:10:29] rosheee: isn't it?
[2022-07-11T11:10:41] Juice: Hmm
[2022-07-11T11:11:04] Juice: Website talks about 5.3 firmware but supposedly vesc is at 6 now
[2022-07-11T11:11:15] rosheee: yes
[2022-07-11T11:11:23] rosheee: in new version ubox is officially in
[2022-07-11T11:11:27] rosheee: and vesc talks about 5.03
[2022-07-11T11:14:59] Juice: Hmm i see thanks
[2022-07-11T11:15:54] Juice: I remember sprintend sharing source code with google drive link with no git, but it seems they actually submitted their code to vedders repo recently
[2022-07-11T11:16:40] rosheee: jup
[2022-07-11T11:16:49] rosheee: will be official fw next time

[2022-07-12T21:13:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i seriously doubt spintend does the soldering themself. it's made in the pcb factory. but still a shitty situation and a poor quality control from spintend.
[2022-07-12T21:14:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: we know they do 😉
[2022-07-12T21:16:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hole through connectors are often hand soldered. but cms, i don't know how they do. oven would melt other side, no ? i never looked how doubled sided pcb/cms are made.

[2022-07-13T22:56:04] Artem Bulashev: Best on the market but yet soldering is not all Automatic. Recent batches do not have solder balls almost ever but always better check, with soldering it’s very hard to produce 100pc without single solder ball jumping off
[2022-07-13T23:24:56] Кирилл: Ahah, good luck

[2022-07-13T23:31:13] Juice: I can't test yet because i need to solder the phase plugs
[2022-07-13T23:31:24] sombre_enfant: Install vesc tool beta go in firmware search your ubox you got and install...
[2022-07-13T23:31:24] rosheee: 10min job

[2022-07-13T23:34:32] rosheee: Nope xD
[2022-07-13T23:42:22] Juice: Hmm ubox has swd interface exposed
[2022-07-13T23:42:34] Juice: Can use that to recover in case it goes THAT bad
[2022-07-13T23:42:49] Juice: Probably best to get one of those programmers in advance

[2022-07-16T00:02:34] Mirono escooters: Soon ill know how glod my heatsinks work
[2022-07-16T00:07:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: light board assembly test (front / rear / leds stripes with turn indicators). comaptible 5v/12v lights. needs to be controlled by smartdisplay.
[2022-07-16T00:09:41] Konstantin: Can I upload you display firmware from ota folder, w/o compiling all?
[2022-07-16T00:09:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes 😁
[2022-07-16T00:10:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: all my boards are ota compatible (can bus or wifi)
[2022-07-16T00:10:17] Konstantin: Nice! Thanks 👍🙏
[2022-07-16T00:10:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: when you update the smartdisplay, all boards detected are updated throught can bus.

[2022-07-16T00:53:56] Paolo ⁭: These mosfet are crazy cheap, the before mos that they use cost about 5/6$ each, that they use now is about 1.2$ each
[2022-07-16T00:57:38] Mirono escooters: Quality diff?
[2022-07-16T00:57:47] Mirono escooters: Spec diff?
[2022-07-16T00:59:34] Paolo ⁭: Yes, heat faster and can fail easier
[2022-07-16T01:19:53] Artem Bulashev: That is the cheap version of v2 - they say they use cheap mosfets in the descriptions
[2022-07-16T01:30:18] Paolo ⁭: Will be better if they sell nude pcb without mosfet 😆
[2022-07-16T07:10:34] Ofek 🐥: I have FLIR camera in my phone, great tool 👍 (here you can see Inokim ox)
[2022-07-16T09:14:14] sombre_enfant: Context
[2022-07-16T09:43:25] sombre_enfant: The adc board cost 30$ u trippin
[2022-07-16T09:44:15] Mirono escooters: Yoi got ulefone? I was seriously considering a phone with thermal imaging inside. I regret i didnt choose it
[2022-07-16T09:45:16] Mirono escooters: Try to load it. It will drop to 0
[2022-07-16T09:50:10] Mirono escooters: Ö
[2022-07-16T09:50:32] Mirono escooters: And if u dont use common gnd?
[2022-07-16T09:52:43] Mirono escooters: Not a optimal fix, but if it works
[2022-07-16T09:52:52] Mirono escooters: U got such a led with common gnd right?
[2022-07-16T09:53:02] Mirono escooters: Strip it open, make it separate ground :)
[2022-07-16T09:53:20] Mirono escooters: U can do separate gnd
[2022-07-16T09:53:24] Mirono escooters: Cool leds tho
[2022-07-16T10:09:12] sombre_enfant: The thing got an stm it wont be plug and play for everything just program it
[2022-07-16T10:13:26] Ofek 🐥: Yes, Armor 11T The best way to describe it is 250$ phone with 250$ camera
[2022-07-16T10:13:40] Mirono escooters: Cool. I considered it
[2022-07-16T10:13:56] Mirono escooters: I had the ulefone power armor 13 before 13200mah battery🤤😂😂
[2022-07-16T10:14:26] Mirono escooters: Armor 11t looked like lower quality tho, idk. Ulefone was ok, just minor bugs and stuff wich you expect from pricr and compaly
[2022-07-16T10:17:27] Ofek 🐥: Exactly. I had the phone fly from my hand at 30km/h, survived it great 😂
[2022-07-16T10:18:09] Mirono escooters: They are tanks
[2022-07-16T10:18:21] Mirono escooters: Now got Samsung fold xd
[2022-07-16T10:18:33] Mirono escooters: Dont want boring phones
[2022-07-16T10:18:54] Mirono escooters: Eh, a thermal camera built in is cool, but how much do i need it. Its just plug in too, not much hassle
[2022-07-16T10:19:06] Mirono escooters: Defenitely curious to see the thermal image of my motor
[2022-07-16T10:19:15] Mirono escooters: With diy heatsink
[2022-07-16T10:20:15] Ofek 🐥: I agree, I have FLIR one for a long time. But now with the camera in my phone, I see myself using it almost everyday 😅
[2022-07-16T10:20:29] Mirono escooters: Fair fair
[2022-07-16T10:20:57] Mirono escooters: Oh well, cant have all :/ I will use for motors and my powerwall
[2022-07-16T10:21:18] Mirono escooters: But i imagine if its build in, u use it aa lot more. My curious mind would check everything.
[2022-07-16T10:22:01] Paolo ⁭: Spintend deleted post of yesterday 😂😂
[2022-07-16T10:22:09] Mirono escooters: Eh maybe after my fold.

[2022-07-16T10:53:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Let me say we kinda know too much From experience we know , spintend products surly needs an eye check for solder balls and just for this fact you would loose warranty by the start🤷‍♂ so no Amy 😅 Also all of our experience is a fuck load of great testing for them, you can bet they do nothing like we do🤷‍♂ So, no I would not support free labor for them
[2022-07-16T11:02:43] Mirono escooters: I was sarcastic
[2022-07-16T11:03:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Thank you

[2022-07-17T00:28:18] Artem Bulashev: White is the paint mark to locate chip correctly
[2022-07-17T00:31:32] Artem Bulashev: First of all ubox can not handle such settings. Second of all which Dualtron/ motors? Third, what is your battery?
[2022-07-17T00:33:37] Artem Bulashev: That is stupid. You will never get to even 90 likely
[2022-07-17T00:36:15] Artem Bulashev: Tell me what is your battery what cells? What connector. I guarantee you 100% your power system can not handle that. For once ubox can not For twice ubox has 10awg power wires, they can’t For Third even xt150 connectors can not handle that and will melt
[2022-07-17T01:01:27] Jan: Two connectors go to two controllers. 20s6p of molicel p42a. So its 144a short time on each connector with 90a permanent max? I didnt read through the conversation properly though.
[2022-07-17T01:09:14] rosheee: Not xD?
[2022-07-17T01:09:26] rosheee: Ubox showed 9ver 190A bsttery amps
[2022-07-17T01:09:27] rosheee: Lol
[2022-07-17T01:09:36] rosheee: What set here?
[2022-07-17T01:09:46] rosheee: We set max 90A battery per esc
[2022-07-17T02:14:40] rosheee: Omg
[2022-07-17T02:14:43] rosheee: Anyone here xD?
[2022-07-17T02:14:47] rosheee: Adam
[2022-07-17T02:15:45] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-07-17T02:15:57] rosheee: Fucc xD
[2022-07-17T02:16:33] rosheee: Dis not good xD?
[2022-07-17T02:44:45] Jan: Short on the motorcable?
[2022-07-17T02:58:14] Unknown: Phase is shorting to the mover cover or axle. Shouldn't be the actual windings since they're laminated and even if they were touching the cover on the inside, it shouldn't short. Your solder joint inside might be touching or you have a cut in the wire that is shorting to the axle. Does the axle also have continuity?
[2022-07-17T03:20:19] rosheee: Yup
[2022-07-17T04:14:55] Unknown: Did you re-wire that motor with bigger phase wires?
[2022-07-17T04:18:37] Unknown: That's why I didn't try n squeeze in huge phase wires myself, didn't want to chance them getting sliced at the axle opening over time. 11awg X 3 (Higo L1019 cable) has been working perfectly on some pretty high settings. 80/225 on the rear and phase wires are completely fine. Never heat up to anywhere near concerning. 50mm magnet Vsett motor will only benefit so much from huge phase wires, diminishing returns so to speak
[2022-07-17T08:55:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Maybe some is that, but this
[2022-07-17T08:56:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <photos/photo_5395@17-07-2022_08-56-16.jpg>
[2022-07-17T08:57:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Surly not that, from same pics🤷‍♂
[2022-07-17T09:03:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤔 Well there is ppl who knows more about that ,but do you have Bluetooth? Coz cruise would need same port
[2022-07-17T09:03:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also trying this as that you do have a cruise button?
[2022-07-17T09:06:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But Bluetooth uses same stuff what cruise needs ,so its a no go together if you dont have two of that
[2022-07-17T09:06:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Let me boot and open workshop
[2022-07-17T09:07:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What vesc you have?
[2022-07-17T11:11:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So on spintend you should have two serial ports also ,unsure how they made it ,i mean atleast on board On vesc side nrf still a serial port 🤷‍♂
[2022-07-17T11:11:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I have the board also

[2022-07-17T11:25:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Do u use uart?
[2022-07-17T11:27:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤔 well actually this should work like this
[2022-07-17T11:27:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Will take a look for you , i dont promise when this happens

[2022-07-17T17:01:52] Artem Bulashev: Wheel made of 1. injection mold plastic 2. CNC Aluminum
[2022-07-17T18:40:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So tried to activate cruise controll Adc beeps up as it turns it on , Bit like a lag than as you let go throttle engine's stop
[2022-07-17T18:40:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also blinkers and other led ports work
[2022-07-17T18:41:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But main front light and horn port dead ,you can measure signal from switch side but nothing on output side🤷‍♂
[2022-07-17T18:41:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Two out of two🤬
[2022-07-17T19:45:44] Mirono escooters: Depends on price
[2022-07-17T19:46:30] Jan: Agree the wheel should be cnc as well
[2022-07-17T19:46:44] Jan: The only thing you touch all the time is plastic?
[2022-07-17T19:55:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Rolf ,there is some update on adc🤣
[2022-07-17T19:55:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So

[2022-07-17T19:57:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Even there is how to wire

[2022-07-17T19:58:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Replaced with old analog what has only wiring
[2022-07-17T19:58:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: All works🤣
[2022-07-17T19:59:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Cc needs further investigating, but atleast this is sorted ,This switch with the leds is crap
[2022-07-17T20:01:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I love when they sell something and never ever tried to put them together , fucking monoshit style
[2022-07-17T20:02:39] Mirono escooters: Monoshit doesnt even try to test it
[2022-07-17T20:02:54] Mirono escooters: Cmon brake 15* wrong angle How. You. Not. Notice. That.
[2022-07-17T20:09:35] Artem Bulashev: Should I add it as 7$ option ?
[2022-07-17T20:11:31] sombre_enfant: Do a fully plastic version too, where do you do the plastic injection ? I work into that i do mold on cnc
[2022-07-17T20:15:43] Artem Bulashev: We won’t be doing it because cnc is just cost effective enough
[2022-07-17T20:16:00] Artem Bulashev: I think we will keep current price as final even, after pre sale ends it may stay same
[2022-07-17T20:17:02] Artem Bulashev: As option so 7$ more.
[2022-07-17T20:17:21] Artem Bulashev: We are thinking making wholesale offerings 20+ 50+ units
[2022-07-17T20:17:35] Artem Bulashev: As small wholesale and wholesale
[2022-07-17T20:31:56] Jan: Yes please
[2022-07-17T21:16:23] Jan: I order 1-2pcs when its a cnc wheel
[2022-07-17T22:00:54] Unknown: I'm willing to bet plastic for the units already pre-ordered. They're due to ship early August so I'm sure the manufacturing process has already started. Unless the ship date is getting pushed back a bit
[2022-07-17T22:03:30] Unknown: I would too honestly. Now I'm curious myself 🧐
[2022-07-17T22:10:05] Jan: Oh the business pressure 😂
[2022-07-17T22:48:48] Unknown: I think if there is now a question between plastic and CNC wheel, it was probably designed/figured as plastic originally but trying to get a feel for how many would prefer CNC for slightly more cost 🤷🏻‍♂️. That's sort of what it sounds like to me
[2022-07-17T23:05:42] Artem Bulashev: yeah CNC ✅ Monday will add option for Aluminum. People that order before that option came to be will get CNC wheel 😊 ❤️ @AJAJ1992 if you order today that will save you few $ 😁 because you will get cnc wheel without extra pay. Will see May be we make CNC wheel free or increase price to 63$ but allow to select plastic wheel for -4$ discount
[2022-07-17T23:09:49] Unknown: That's great man, thank you so much 🤗
[2022-07-17T23:15:30] Unknown: Can we expedite Adam's shipping so I can try it before I purchase my own. I'm sure his review will help sales.
[2022-07-17T23:19:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Could you explain a bit
[2022-07-17T23:22:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So its clear you spin there and back My question would be how sensitive is it to spin, not sure how to describe Also if you let it go what happens ,returns to neutral or keeps position?
[2022-07-17T23:31:14] Unknown: I'm assuming it returns to zero as it has a button for cruise controll already. I asked about the throw or sensitivity as stock is ridiculously jerky
[2022-07-17T23:33:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well lets see ,but all is kinda needed information
[2022-07-18T00:10:40] Artem Bulashev: Yes it would return to 0 position. On VESC forward scroll is acceleration, back backwards is variable regen brake. On normal controller forward is same but on dedicated wire (that wire output ignores scrolling back, because normal controllers can’t process it). Backward scroll can be blocked by included screw, so you won’t be able to scroll back. Or you can connect E-brake wire and have e-brake engage at -20% backward scroll on any normal controller 😎 this way you can utilize bidirectional operation even on normal controller ❤️
[2022-07-18T00:12:38] Artem Bulashev: Lastly there is cruise button, tap it and throttle output will be held 👍 you can release wheel. If you move wheel again, throttle hold will be immediately disabled. - that button actually has input cable, which allows you to use it for any other external application that needs momentary switch , like horn for example
[2022-07-18T00:16:12] D J: I'm happy...I'll get with CNC 🤩
[2022-07-18T00:56:40] Artem Bulashev: It is cnc if you get now yeah, as of tomorrow you will be able to select what wheel you want (now it is aluminum only)
[2022-07-18T01:17:03] rosheee: Fastride doesnt reply anymore lol
[2022-07-18T01:17:12] rosheee: Scam company lol
[2022-07-18T01:54:37] Unknown: That's really smart design man. Works for everyone. That's what a lot of companies miss in this industry. Single faceted devices that are only friendly to their system. A universal bi-directional throttle really is a beautiful thing ❤️
[2022-07-18T10:46:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Thanks for the long answer👌😊
[2022-07-18T10:49:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I measured all near light stuff ,with thats shitty button didn't work,but with analod become sweet , i am Guessing that there is more what you need to do
[2022-07-18T10:50:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You need to set stuff, this works for us

[2022-07-18T23:20:55] Mirono escooters: Agree
[2022-07-18T23:39:45] Martin Kaktits: 👻
[2022-07-19T10:41:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Cool Front small is use full , like a visibility one Brake ligh stand alone maybe better 🤷‍♂ Maybe if that's a split add strobe options for it?🤔
[2022-07-19T10:46:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: never thought about strobe effect for brake, but why not. currently, you set a minimal intensity for 'no brake' and it's progressive from this to max light depending of brake pressure (with on/off brake, it's either directly full or progressive based on pressure time). those settings are duplicated for 'main light on' and 'main light off'
[2022-07-19T10:58:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: On fuel bikes ,you can add a module for it , you connect the power ,,and signal line soon as you brake It starts to strobe, i can show you what i mean have a module like that ,so maybe i can show inside also in private if you like
[2022-07-19T11:05:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: glad if you can show me in video. so yes please !
[2022-07-19T11:15:56] rosheee: Like g30 normal
[2022-07-19T11:16:33] rosheee: So and friends get special price :-D
[2022-07-19T11:18:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: For that i am not able now
[2022-07-19T11:18:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sent you private
[2022-07-19T11:33:38] Artem Bulashev: Main and brake usually same light but different brightness level
[2022-07-19T11:35:03] Artem Bulashev: Led addressable strip could replace all of those lights if it can be programmed to work. But guess not everybody will use addressable leds
[2022-07-19T11:38:01] Artem Bulashev: Yeah if break engaged even abit than brake light starts to strobe fast, not like blinker, other wise may be confusing
[2022-07-19T11:48:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: <video_file>
[2022-07-19T11:55:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, but cabling can be different (2 lights common ground / 2 separated / 1 dimmable)
[2022-07-19T11:57:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeah. it's the best, but harder to integrate
[2022-07-19T12:06:56] rosheee: Ordered Has 2 wires xD
[2022-07-19T12:07:04] rosheee: Red and blinker
[2022-07-19T12:09:10] Artem Bulashev: He means 2 red, one dimmed one full power wire. Or it can be all on one line
[2022-07-19T13:05:02] Unknown: Does spintends Bluetooth module work with flipsky vesc?
[2022-07-19T13:06:35] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-07-19T16:24:08] rosheee: YeYeyey
[2022-07-19T16:24:27] rosheee: Still cant believe
[2022-07-19T16:25:08] Mirono escooters: U rich enough
[2022-07-19T16:34:55] rosheee: that's 2 much even for me
[2022-07-19T16:35:00] rosheee: that's what i pay for my racecar for display
[2022-07-19T16:35:23] rosheee: if i can put it into car then ok
[2022-07-19T16:36:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: think about a good vesc. how much is it ? and for what ? 0 dev software (already done), 1 or 2 stm at 10€/p, 12/24 mosfets at 3/5€/p, few gate drivers, some cheap components. no case. how much do you pay ?
[2022-07-19T16:36:53] rosheee: true dat
[2022-07-19T16:37:03] rosheee: u done dev by urself
[2022-07-19T16:37:12] rosheee: u have video of display?
[2022-07-19T16:37:14] Mirono escooters: Support francois 💚

[2022-07-19T16:42:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i have a job that can afford me some vacations 😉 just arrived at genova (IT)
[2022-07-19T16:42:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: smartdisplay is just for fun and a personnal dare (can you create a complex electronic device from scratch and sell it) 🤣
[2022-07-19T16:42:32] Artem Bulashev: Difference is NEED vs Want Vesc you Need to drive scooter Screen you Want to see live data
[2022-07-19T16:42:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i really enjoy this. i've learnt so much things (electronic design, ios programming, python, plastic manufacturing, chinese businesses...)
[2022-07-19T16:42:40] Artem Bulashev: That’s where price argument comes from
[2022-07-19T16:42:52] Artem Bulashev: I think
[2022-07-19T16:42:56] rosheee: word
[2022-07-19T16:43:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: well, not exactly. a lot of cheap controllers can do motor control.
[2022-07-19T16:43:29] rosheee: word
[2022-07-19T16:44:02] Artem Bulashev: I also could place it at 290€ but 400 is real stretch even for me. Sure there will be people buying it either way though just less
[2022-07-19T16:44:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yyk aee cheap and powerful
[2022-07-19T16:45:12] Artem Bulashev: Yeah and that’s why people buy 150$ vesc and will not buy 400€ display. Because vesc they need and it is 150-350 vs screen is just a desire (want) and it is 400
[2022-07-19T16:45:45] Mirono escooters: Screen isnt needed indeed but so nice
[2022-07-19T16:45:52] rosheee: yah i use mobile phone
[2022-07-19T16:45:52] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5403@19-07-2022_16-45-52.jpg>
[2022-07-19T16:46:05] rosheee: but scrreen looks more thicc
[2022-07-19T16:46:09] rosheee: more
[2022-07-19T16:46:15] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-07-19T16:46:19] Mirono escooters: I need boobies and big batteries
[2022-07-19T16:46:19] Mirono escooters: Ez
[2022-07-19T16:57:35] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2022-07-19T16:57:43] Artem Bulashev: Regen is true
[2022-07-19T16:58:02] Artem Bulashev: You can see amps charging battery in app live data
[2022-07-19T16:58:43] Artem Bulashev: If you push e-brake that means you switch from pushing forward to regen
[2022-07-19T16:58:55] Artem Bulashev: You can not have regen while accelerating 🤣
[2022-07-19T16:59:23] Artem Bulashev: It’s like trying to walk backward while running forward. Ain’t happening
[2022-07-19T17:00:45] Artem Bulashev: Than you are applies g mechanical brake
[2022-07-19T17:00:55] Artem Bulashev: For motors it is same as climbing up the hill
[2022-07-19T17:01:48] Artem Bulashev: When you apply e-brake
[2022-07-19T17:01:54] Artem Bulashev: That is same regen brake
[2022-07-19T17:02:00] Artem Bulashev: Brake by motor
[2022-07-19T17:02:13] Artem Bulashev: Electronic break
[2022-07-19T17:02:33] Artem Bulashev: Man when you break by motor
[2022-07-19T17:02:38] Artem Bulashev: It is called ebrake
[2022-07-19T17:03:15] Artem Bulashev: Some controllers can convert generated current from that action and store it to battery = regenerative brake
[2022-07-19T17:03:33] Artem Bulashev: Adc2 is for brake signal
[2022-07-19T17:04:15] Artem Bulashev: All scoter levers have on/off switch that tells scooter controller when mechanical brake is pressed
[2022-07-19T17:04:42] Artem Bulashev: Looks like a pair of wires coming out of mechanical brake handle
[2022-07-19T17:06:46] Artem Bulashev: That’s for hall sensor brake handle like xiomi has (3 wires thus)
[2022-07-19T17:07:02] Artem Bulashev: Normally escooter break handles have only on/off switch
[2022-07-19T17:07:07] Artem Bulashev: Two wires
[2022-07-19T17:07:23] Artem Bulashev: As you can see left and right brake levers input on adapter
[2022-07-19T17:14:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: of course ! it's not the targeted market !
[2022-07-19T17:23:56] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I understand, hope it goes well 🙂👌
[2022-07-19T17:28:36] rosheee: Or buy 600euro from france that never arrives
[2022-07-19T17:39:16] Face de Pin Sucé: You don't need VESC, chinese crap 30$ is working
[2022-07-19T17:40:11] Mirono escooters: My 12€ ali esc works I just wonder how. How is that possible for thzt €
[2022-07-19T17:40:21] rosheee: yo bratans
[2022-07-19T17:40:28] rosheee: whawt u think about xtr brakes?
[2022-07-19T17:40:34] rosheee: magura or xtr ?
[2022-07-19T17:40:47] rosheee: don't wanna spend another 450$ on magura ^^'
[2022-07-19T17:41:24] rosheee: Getting the MT7s set up well is key....Shimanos are dummy proof. Magura....you need someone who really knows how to bleed these well
[2022-07-19T18:21:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Really easY to bleed all
[2022-07-19T18:22:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also as i said your lvl would require moped disc and calipers
[2022-07-19T18:28:55] Jan: Omg buying ESCs for scooters is just the worst. Shady companies, years in advance pre-orders, unknown out-of-stock periods, scammers, etc
[2022-07-19T18:32:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I dont have bad experiences

[2022-07-19T21:21:31] rosheee: Et on attend de recevoir les controleur spéciaux avec l’écran
[2022-07-19T21:21:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i guess you've translated 😉
[2022-07-19T21:22:07] rosheee: rosheee: But you made a special order with screen And we are waiting to receive the special controllers with the screen And we are waiting to receive the special controllers with the screen
[2022-07-19T21:22:32] rosheee: Because for it to be compatible, it must be done at the factory.
[2022-07-19T21:22:54] rosheee: RLY?
[2022-07-19T21:24:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i guess so. what did you order ?

[2022-07-19T21:26:45] rosheee: That’s true
[2022-07-19T21:28:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no idea. but possible. those screens are bafang 750 designed for bafang controllers. i guess they need to program it for kelly. but it's weird they doesn't have some in stock already programmed.
[2022-07-19T21:30:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: depends if it's a hack or official bafang 'white' order
[2022-07-19T21:31:20] rosheee: It is rly true
[2022-07-19T21:31:26] rosheee: XD wtf
[2022-07-19T21:31:28] rosheee: 7230ST
[2022-07-19T21:32:52] Mirono escooters: Usually its like that.. shit..
[2022-07-19T21:33:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: https://ebikepricecomparison.com/it/PRODOTTI/display-bafang-750c/
[2022-07-19T21:33:26] Mirono escooters: Apart from that they should atleast mention it..
[2022-07-19T21:33:44] Mirono escooters: Not take money and wait so long and dont answer Borderline scam
[2022-07-19T21:36:38] rosheee: I go to tjeie store if not received until 4th august

[2022-07-19T21:39:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: seriously, i've never seen such customer service / communication in any other french shop (in bad terms)
[2022-07-19T21:41:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean , that however some speaks perfect English they like to do this in rl also🤷‍♂ But its not everybody

[2022-07-19T21:46:41] rosheee: XD
[2022-07-19T22:30:52] Paolo ⁭: When your IQ is 900000000 then use double spot welder
[2022-07-19T22:35:08] Mirono escooters: Loll used those before upgrading kweld
[2022-07-19T23:01:59] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-07-19T23:10:30] rosheee: btw
[2022-07-19T23:10:45] rosheee: @koxx3 why that many cables?
[2022-07-19T23:11:30] Paolo ⁭: Because the board is also external led light horn controller
[2022-07-19T23:14:57] rosheee: ok why not use 1 cable with "X" plugs on it and put it inside stem?
[2022-07-19T23:18:33] rosheee: <photos/photo_5411@19-07-2022_23-18-33.jpg>
[2022-07-19T23:19:09] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-07-19T23:19:45] Paolo ⁭: Need big current
[2022-07-19T23:19:47] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-07-19T23:19:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it was one of the first installation. now : throttle + buttons + controller/expansion boards (+ ebrake if you want). 3 or 4 cables. and cables outout is on the back (less visible)
[2022-07-19T23:20:02] Unknown: The ports feed out to different devices I imagine, just like this. How could you combine one wire to different port and different usages?
[2022-07-19T23:22:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if you want to manufacture such cable, go for it. but in small quantities, it will cost 50€/p 🤣🤣
[2022-07-19T23:22:39] Paolo ⁭: Then smart display 500€🥲
[2022-07-19T23:23:03] rosheee: true
[2022-07-19T23:23:07] rosheee: but i would resolder it
[2022-07-19T23:23:08] rosheee: def.
[2022-07-19T23:23:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeah 😓😓
[2022-07-19T23:24:05] Paolo ⁭: At that point Display of Sony xperia 4K hdr phone cost less lol hahah
[2022-07-19T23:24:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and don't fortget there are different vesc cabling (5v/12v/vbat... uart/can... power latch or not), and it's also compatible with kelly, minimo,vsett... cabling is different for each case.
[2022-07-19T23:26:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's much easier when you control all the chain (build the whole escooter)
[2022-07-19T23:26:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: or like nucular, provide display+controller
[2022-07-19T23:29:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i know juliet/higo are kinda 'cool', but : 1/ they are expansive 2/ you can't solder them on plug side 3/ you can't modify anyrhing. 🥲🥲
[2022-07-19T23:29:24] rosheee: ok OK OK
[2022-07-19T23:29:37] Unknown: Yes, molded housings are not really easy to modify lol
[2022-07-19T23:29:40] rosheee: true dat
[2022-07-19T23:29:46] rosheee: modling fucking expansive
[2022-07-19T23:30:14] Unknown: Everything expensive in today's world 🙄
[2022-07-19T23:32:39] Konstantin: Nuclear cost less, even if add extra light controller. And module communication by can...need only few fires....why all communication make on screen...
[2022-07-19T23:33:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: when i ordered samples to chinese manufacturers, for simple jst-ph/sm cables, it's 1-2€/p for very simple cables. and the received samples are really bad. wrong cable color, cheap jst clone (one plugged, when you try to pull it out, you break the socket. lol.)... and 40e dhl for samples 🙈🙈
[2022-07-19T23:34:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also note that lot mods what you can see here is pioneering , that makes it even more expensive But this is also a part of the game and lets say kinda nice when they step in your footprint and not the otherway around
[2022-07-19T23:35:35] Face de Pin Sucé: I am in trouble with those guys tbh
[2022-07-19T23:35:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What is the Size of that?
[2022-07-19T23:35:52] rosheee: then we go 2gether with sum friends of mine and beat the shit out of them
[2022-07-19T23:36:05] rosheee: then put all shit we can grab in g65amg
[2022-07-19T23:36:08] rosheee: and drive away
[2022-07-19T23:36:13] Face de Pin Sucé: <sticker>
[2022-07-19T23:36:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Tell us ,or you go with friends of Rs😁
[2022-07-19T23:36:24] rosheee: sucé
[2022-07-19T23:36:27] rosheee: all should come
[2022-07-19T23:36:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah
[2022-07-19T23:36:33] rosheee: 30ppl
[2022-07-19T23:36:35] rosheee: then raid their store
[2022-07-19T23:36:39] rosheee: and tape them on the wall
[2022-07-19T23:36:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what do you mean by 'few wires' ? throttle and controller cables (can bus). if you like internal display buttons of nucular, ok (i hate not been in control during the ride, so, no central buttons for my installation), it's 1 less cable. but for most parts, it's the same.
[2022-07-19T23:36:57] rosheee: and shit in their postbox
[2022-07-19T23:37:32] rosheee: what big current?
[2022-07-19T23:37:56] Paolo ⁭: Neopixel current is so big lol
[2022-07-19T23:38:13] Paolo ⁭: If 5v, for meter are like 5A lol if the brightness is good
[2022-07-19T23:39:22] rosheee: neopixel?
[2022-07-19T23:39:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's why i deport like control to another desk board. and it would be stupid to have big cables going deck-display-deck.
[2022-07-19T23:41:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Also near the screen, i like it pretty much ,But for myself it's kinda not useful, i mean i dont pay attention to it 😅 I am not looking,how fast i am Mostly voltgate is interesting for me but only look at it when i stop 🤷‍♂
[2022-07-19T23:41:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it tested led stripes with 12v/3a and 5v/3a. i don't have the power supply tongo higher, but connectors are made for 5a
[2022-07-19T23:43:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: voltage/autonomy, but also temperatures (contro/motors), current time and current mode (1/2/3). those the the infos i look the most when riding
[2022-07-19T23:45:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeag i get u ,not talking against it ,i just dont really pay attention in the screen But i like contoller/ motor , thats neat for sure
[2022-07-19T23:46:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: everybody needs/likes something different 😉
[2022-07-19T23:46:11] Paolo ⁭: Yes and wire inside Juliet can’t handle continuously such power🙁
[2022-07-19T23:46:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 1/2/3 is like on adc2 ?
[2022-07-19T23:46:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: true. 26awg ?
[2022-07-19T23:46:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: speed modes, like minimotors
[2022-07-19T23:46:47] Paolo ⁭: I think the maximum will be 22awg
[2022-07-19T23:47:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I know but how its made
[2022-07-19T23:47:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: configurable speed modes 😉
[2022-07-19T23:47:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like adc
[2022-07-19T23:47:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But tell me
[2022-07-19T23:47:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Is it About amps or about throttle
[2022-07-19T23:47:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Adc2 plays this with throttle
[2022-07-19T23:48:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Shortens virtual max to x % While you still use full Throttle route
[2022-07-19T23:48:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not sure to understand. it sends speed limits to the vesc by can bus or uart. you switch mode with the 'buttons box'. you configure speed limits with the display/buttons or the android/ios app.
[2022-07-19T23:49:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So like you would push half way but its full actually
[2022-07-19T23:49:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than totally different
[2022-07-19T23:49:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Now i get it
[2022-07-19T23:50:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This is another what shows the lot work in it
[2022-07-19T23:51:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i really need to work on the website to explain all features 😅
[2022-07-19T23:53:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Surly I would say , we will help you proof read it at end of the day
[2022-07-19T23:53:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That will tell how understandable it is
[2022-07-19T23:54:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean lot ppl here are already interested, some will take the time and check for sure
[2022-07-19T23:56:15] Unknown: Are things like speed modes (same as Nucular I assume... "Power modes" another way to say it) writable thru the display? Like, can settings be adjusted in the display like Nucular? Still unsure if the display is writable or read only...
[2022-07-19T23:58:08] Unknown: I think you're thinking of the display buttons.. they can be set as "hot keys" and programmed to any function but external buttons can also be used. I don't use the internal display buttons (hot keys) for lights, speed modes, power, etc... External momentary or latching buttons can be used
[2022-07-20T00:00:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Try to explain it again So adc2 has 3 speed modes also 1 full max throttle 2-3 what you set These are x % of the full throttle It just plays with throttle virtual limits So if you set 50% that like pushing throttle only 50% but The 50% in that speed mode is the max
[2022-07-20T00:00:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This has nothing do with amps
[2022-07-20T00:00:37] Unknown: I think more things than max speed can be adjusted tho
[2022-07-20T00:00:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Did you tried?
[2022-07-20T00:01:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And as i said ,its not about speed or power its virtual limit playing
[2022-07-20T00:02:19] Unknown: No, I'm just saying if it's anything like Nucular speed modes (which is think it is) many parameters are adjustable for each independent mode. Remember, koxx smartdisplay is compatible with more than just VESC
[2022-07-20T00:02:35] Unknown: I mean.. I guess in a way yes lol. It's software settings
[2022-07-20T00:02:57] Unknown: The software settings limits or sets the hardware
[2022-07-20T00:03:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This not Really software thingy 😅 set hardware yep
[2022-07-20T00:04:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: There are some potmeter stuff on it
[2022-07-20T00:05:23] Unknown: Something like this... How each setting is communicated to the controller, I have no idea... Virtual limiting is one way to describe it 😅
[2022-07-20T00:05:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for settings : - 100% read - 95% write on the display. all settings with strings are not editable on the display. too boring to set a strings like wifi name/password on the display. - everything in read/write on ios/android
[2022-07-20T00:06:09] Unknown: That's awesome man. That's a game changer
[2022-07-20T00:06:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok 👍
[2022-07-20T00:06:15] Unknown: Beautiful work
[2022-07-20T00:07:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i spent a lot of time on the apps. i can add a new setting in 15 minutes, then the release is published on a web server and everybody can update the firmware throught wifi in 5 minutes, including expansion baords.
[2022-07-20T00:07:47] rosheee: you can share source code in 0.5min?
[2022-07-20T00:07:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope
[2022-07-20T00:07:57] rosheee: 😜
[2022-07-20T00:08:30] Unknown: I think when people talk about the price, they are underestimating how much work you put into it and the huge list of functions it actually has
[2022-07-20T00:08:39] rosheee: XD
[2022-07-20T00:08:57] rosheee: i put over 100'000 in my golf 3 and idk how many hours of work
[2022-07-20T00:08:59] rosheee: sold it for 13k
[2022-07-20T00:09:00] rosheee: XD
[2022-07-20T00:09:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: settings example in app
[2022-07-20T00:09:12] Unknown: Super
[2022-07-20T00:09:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: (fr/en translated)
[2022-07-20T00:09:23] rosheee: but this new product
[2022-07-20T00:09:26] rosheee: so can't compare
[2022-07-20T00:09:40] Unknown: Right. So why trying to compare then 🤪
[2022-07-20T00:10:00] rosheee: hmmm idk
[2022-07-20T00:10:04] rosheee: i can't do pricetags
[2022-07-20T00:10:22] rosheee: even when had own company 😆 buy stuff for 0.1$ and sell for 9$ was WTF for me
[2022-07-20T00:10:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You guys overthink
[2022-07-20T00:10:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: errors history is also a 'must have' for me.
[2022-07-20T00:10:56] rosheee: word
[2022-07-20T00:11:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This is nasa lvl what adc2 does
[2022-07-20T00:11:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not exactly, but you can set a % of max vesc phase current for eco modes.
[2022-07-20T00:12:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If he would unsure we would understand 😁
[2022-07-20T00:14:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well that's kinda awesome I would say
[2022-07-20T00:15:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So

[2022-07-20T00:18:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: This is what i was saying, there is that two things i point at That's where you set speed 2 and 3 This only limits the throttle virtually You set it 50% and it gives you the half power
[2022-07-20T00:19:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: firmware flash page, with beta/stable and modifications history. a simple click, and you flash everything.
[2022-07-20T00:19:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_5377@16-07-2022_00-11-09.jpg>
[2022-07-20T00:20:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: oh ! ok. understood. but with vesc in current mode, it will only limit acceleration, not speed... correct me if i'm wrong.

[2022-07-20T00:23:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: End speed unsure , acceleration is not limited Just imagine you dont have adc2 and you press throttle just half way Same will happen
[2022-07-20T00:24:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yours compared to this is NASA lvl🤣
[2022-07-20T00:24:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Dont kill us🤤🤤🤤🤤

[2022-07-21T14:40:36] Artem Bulashev: We added high viscosity lubricant Now it is great
[2022-07-21T14:40:38] Cass: Airport
[2022-07-21T14:40:44] Mirono escooters: Destroyed?
[2022-07-21T14:41:30] Cass: Hopefully not, we will see
[2022-07-21T14:41:38] Artem Bulashev: Now
[2022-07-21T14:41:50] Mirono escooters: I hope for u
[2022-07-21T14:41:58] Mirono escooters: Maybe u xan order at discount haha
[2022-07-21T14:42:07] Artem Bulashev: <video_file>
[2022-07-21T14:43:13] Cass: will pay again that 80 eur if needed, don't care, just want it 😆
[2022-07-21T14:44:07] Oliver Eliasson: Looks amazing
[2022-07-21T14:57:16] Mirono escooters: They had litrle stoxk left
[2022-07-21T16:28:28] Artem Bulashev: Yeah high viscosity lubricant made it a very smooth and better at recoil after releasing from full deflection For future will redesign wheel to loose weight from 8g to 4g

[2022-07-22T02:57:45] Izuna 生活: Hey, I wrote a guide on a German forum page about the installation of a VESC into the xiaomi scooter (or ninebot scooter) with the xiaomi display support, might be interesting for someone (If you do not understand German, try opening the page in Google Translate): https://rollerplausch.com/threads/vesc-controller-einbau-1s-pro2-g30.6032/
[2022-07-22T11:52:09] Mirono escooters: Thats deadpoint, u can try a recalibration but its problably just a shit throttle
[2022-07-22T11:52:12] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_5431@22-07-2022_11-52-12.jpg>
[2022-07-22T11:52:21] Mirono escooters: Lets see how good my heatsinks work
[2022-07-22T12:01:28] Martin Kaktits: thats cool device
[2022-07-22T12:25:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Show throttle, But you should be able 🤔
[2022-07-22T12:27:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yes we have this also
[2022-07-22T12:28:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: @SirGeoff could explain you how its set
[2022-07-22T12:28:29] Mirono escooters: Yes. Massive dead point
[2022-07-22T12:28:31] Tommy: 🤢 buy 300x, way better
[2022-07-22T12:28:33] Mirono escooters: Cant do anything
[2022-07-22T12:28:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Wrong
[2022-07-22T12:28:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: As i said he is able
[2022-07-22T12:29:15] Mirono escooters: How, im interested
[2022-07-22T12:31:33] Face de Pin Sucé: Weped X Camping
[2022-07-22T12:31:33] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_5432@22-07-2022_12-31-33.jpg>
[2022-07-22T12:31:33] Tommy: you can put a piece of glue inside to block part of the movement, but it still remains a very inconvenient to use and low quality accelerator better 300x
[2022-07-22T12:31:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Normaly you have a dead point till throttle sits collateral with the handlebar, nit the first time using it ,but settings made by @SirGeoff
[2022-07-22T12:32:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: With adc2 it was possible to make zero dead point
[2022-07-22T12:32:46] Mirono escooters: No settings, its throttle hardware related not software..
[2022-07-22T12:49:43] SirGeoff: Tbh, our throttle has minimal dead zone. But it starts very minimal values, and after it changes to normal acceleration.
[2022-07-22T14:23:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: We have 108x also
[2022-07-22T14:37:14] sombre_enfant: 270x top

[2022-07-22T15:15:51] Mirono escooters: Yea i need to drive more lol
[2022-07-22T15:15:59] Mirono escooters: Motor case 31, heatsink 28, good
[2022-07-22T15:16:03] Mirono escooters: Temp 15 outside
[2022-07-22T15:16:23] Unknown: Very good transfer to the sinks 👍
[2022-07-22T15:16:47] Unknown: Do you have thermal paste, tape or pad?
[2022-07-22T15:16:49] Mirono escooters: Yea, but i need to get more heat😂😂😂
[2022-07-22T15:16:53] Mirono escooters: Tape
[2022-07-22T15:17:01] Mirono escooters: This tells something , but lets do more
[2022-07-22T15:17:06] Unknown: LoL, yea for a real test for sure
[2022-07-22T15:17:06] Mirono escooters: Also check brakes, them get hot
[2022-07-22T15:17:15] Mirono escooters: Eh on a hot day ill go drive
[2022-07-22T15:17:24] Mirono escooters: Problem is vesc overheats..
[2022-07-22T15:17:36] Unknown: Oh boy they do. My Maguras sometimes smoke on hard stops 🙈
[2022-07-22T15:17:55] Unknown: The sintered pads are super aggressive
[2022-07-22T15:18:16] Unknown: Ahh, gotcha
[2022-07-22T15:26:06] Mirono escooters: Before motor does. Haha
[2022-07-22T15:26:09] Mirono escooters: Wil fix soon
[2022-07-22T15:26:12] Mirono escooters: 😂😋
[2022-07-22T15:26:15] Mirono escooters: Gotta try thzt
[2022-07-22T15:28:22] Jan: Is there any TDP data of the mosfets available for the spintend uboxes?
[2022-07-22T15:31:30] Paolo ⁭: Which model? 100v version or 75v one? Chinese mosfet or good one?
[2022-07-22T15:32:03] Jan: 100v
[2022-07-22T15:32:15] Jan: The mosfet that are on it when you order it
[2022-07-22T15:34:20] Paolo ⁭: Black version?
[2022-07-22T15:43:30] Jan: Yes
[2022-07-22T16:09:17] Paolo ⁭: https://www.onsemi.com/pdf/datasheet/fdbl0200n100-d.pdf
[2022-07-22T16:38:54] D J: They are good?what do we have to know when choosing good mosfets?
[2022-07-22T16:41:35] D J: for example which MOSFETs would be good to put in the Ubox 75 V2 and change the originals?
[2022-07-22T16:44:11] Paolo ⁭: Brand reliability, the max source-drain resistance , gate-source capacitance , drain current T=100 , power dissipation.
[2022-07-22T16:44:35] Paolo ⁭: Already one of better it have
[2022-07-22T16:44:52] Paolo ⁭: No sense change mosfet
[2022-07-22T19:05:00] rosheee: I talked a lot with spintend about it
[2022-07-22T19:05:57] D J: What they say?
[2022-07-22T19:06:14] Artem Bulashev: And 100v version has the best FET out there for 100v
[2022-07-22T19:32:50] rosheee: Told them to build me 1 with the best parts they can find
[2022-07-22T19:32:52] rosheee: told me alrdy in
[2022-07-22T19:32:56] rosheee: we also had that discussion here
[2022-07-22T19:51:42] Artem Bulashev: Did they give any better fet number for 75v?
[2022-07-22T19:56:19] rosheee: 75V runs cool
[2022-07-22T19:56:21] rosheee: Nope
[2022-07-22T19:56:24] rosheee: They said they csbt
[2022-07-22T19:56:27] rosheee: Cant find better
[2022-07-22T19:56:30] rosheee: Told them i pay 1k
[2022-07-22T20:32:25] Artem Bulashev: Just buy used Nuk than if you have this Budget
[2022-07-22T20:32:49] Artem Bulashev: A lot better on all accounts beside lacking different shapes and sizes
[2022-07-22T20:42:30] Gigolo Joe: Nuc is da best
[2022-07-22T21:43:42] rosheee: ordered alrdy

[2022-07-22T21:54:44] Paolo ⁭: With 2 controller i hope
[2022-07-22T21:55:15] Gigolo Joe: No 1 motor
[2022-07-22T21:55:21] Gigolo Joe: Magik
[2022-07-22T21:55:30] Gigolo Joe: I wrote new code for it
[2022-07-22T21:55:53] Gigolo Joe: No more 2 volts difference Only 0.4 from actual voltage

[2022-07-22T21:58:39] sombre_enfant: They crazy
[2022-07-22T21:59:01] Gigolo Joe: Style Like Ducati
[2022-07-22T21:59:22] Mirono escooters: Yea style but strenggth and shit?..🥲
[2022-07-22T22:00:44] Gigolo Joe: STRONG
[2022-07-22T22:11:44] Face de Pin Sucé: Do you have smart BMS ?
[2022-07-22T22:12:03] Gigolo Joe: Yep Ant Opened to 150a
[2022-07-22T22:12:25] Face de Pin Sucé: So you have 16000W displayed on it?
[2022-07-22T23:09:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah inokim not kugoo 😁
[2022-07-23T00:05:02] Ofek 🐥: Recompiled from nolimits?
[2022-07-23T00:13:32] Gigolo Joe: Nope Wrote a different one
[2022-07-23T00:14:05] Gigolo Joe: אופק יא שועל ערבות ערמומי
[2022-07-23T00:15:31] Ofek 🐥: שועל? אני משחק עם vesc ולא מזמן קניתי ox.. 😉
[2022-07-23T00:16:00] Paolo ⁭: Gg
[2022-07-23T00:19:17] Ofek 🐥: And don't worry, I'm not going to sell a competitive controller for your foreskin 😂 just trying to find the best riding experience
[2022-07-23T00:54:46] rosheee: but shouldn't acc. be better with that b00st?

[2022-07-23T13:25:08] Stan: Temps are rising faster than kmph 🤣😎
[2022-07-23T15:02:36] Artem Bulashev: 17000w / 200a max = 85v under full load.
[2022-07-23T15:02:55] Artem Bulashev: Something is not correct there or you have 22s battery?
[2022-07-23T15:03:13] Gigolo Joe: 20s
[2022-07-23T15:03:25] Artem Bulashev: Than it is not possible
[2022-07-23T15:03:38] Кирилл: Thats not battery current
[2022-07-23T15:03:40] Face de Pin Sucé: I max is phase amps
[2022-07-23T15:03:45] Face de Pin Sucé: BUT
[2022-07-23T15:03:56] Face de Pin Sucé: You can't have batt amps > phase amps
[2022-07-23T15:04:03] Face de Pin Sucé: So there's something wrong yes
[2022-07-23T15:04:06] Artem Bulashev: Are from battery I see
[2022-07-23T15:04:26] Artem Bulashev: That is per motor 200 perhaps
[2022-07-23T15:04:34] Face de Pin Sucé: He said, one motor only
[2022-07-23T15:04:36] Кирилл: Battery current is on another tab
[2022-07-23T15:04:52] Кирилл: Called ibatt
[2022-07-23T15:04:55] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes but there is a point, you can't have battery amps superior to phase amps
[2022-07-23T15:05:02] Кирилл: Ofc
[2022-07-23T15:05:18] Face de Pin Sucé: So Phase amps should be a lot more than 200A for 17000W with 20S
[2022-07-23T15:05:22] Artem Bulashev: If he has 200phase on one motor
[2022-07-23T15:05:31] Artem Bulashev: That means that total battery current may be 300
[2022-07-23T15:05:34] Artem Bulashev: We don’t know
[2022-07-23T15:05:38] Artem Bulashev: Than it is possible
[2022-07-23T15:05:40] Face de Pin Sucé: He said single motor on this scooter
[2022-07-23T15:05:45] Artem Bulashev: Oh
[2022-07-23T15:05:48] Artem Bulashev: One motor
[2022-07-23T15:05:51] Artem Bulashev: Emmm
[2022-07-23T15:05:59] Artem Bulashev: Than something is wrong
[2022-07-23T15:06:38] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_4617@06-06-2022_15-41-15.jpg>
[2022-07-23T15:06:44] Face de Pin Sucé: Look when reaching 19000W
[2022-07-23T15:06:50] Face de Pin Sucé: Almost 500A phase current
[2022-07-23T15:06:57] Mirono escooters: Ö
[2022-07-23T15:07:00] Кирилл: Hmm, Not a lot.. just around 230A
[2022-07-23T15:07:10] Mirono escooters: How that still works
[2022-07-23T15:07:30] Artem Bulashev: Watts calculated from battery amps * battery voltage at an instance
[2022-07-23T15:07:41] Artem Bulashev: Highest result displayed
[2022-07-23T15:07:43] Face de Pin Sucé: You got a point
[2022-07-23T15:07:57] Face de Pin Sucé: Maybe he has a battery that sagged not much
[2022-07-23T15:08:39] Artem Bulashev: Consider sag 10% at least from full 20s 84v-8.4v = 75.6v 225a needed yes
[2022-07-23T15:09:05] Кирилл: I calculate always with nominals, but yea
[2022-07-23T15:09:10] Artem Bulashev: With 0 sag not possible still
[2022-07-23T15:09:55] Artem Bulashev: 17000/84=202a
[2022-07-23T15:11:02] Кирилл: Can be incorrect software settings and values?
[2022-07-23T15:11:09] Artem Bulashev: No
[2022-07-23T15:11:21] Artem Bulashev: There is no setting for measuring calibration
[2022-07-23T15:11:28] Artem Bulashev: It is in FW
[2022-07-23T15:12:13] Кирилл: Hmm, maybe its summed from dual. But it said its one motor
[2022-07-23T15:12:15] Кирилл: Strange
[2022-07-23T15:13:45] Paolo ⁭: He says single motor
[2022-07-23T15:14:02] Paolo ⁭: I think simply code is fucked or sometjing else
[2022-07-23T15:14:12] Artem Bulashev: Single motor video 8500w max
[2022-07-23T15:14:27] Artem Bulashev: So dual around 17000
[2022-07-23T15:14:42] Artem Bulashev: Here watch watts
[2022-07-23T15:15:00] Paolo ⁭: @artBula
[2022-07-23T15:16:28] Artem Bulashev: Than why 2x difference between video of single motor and max watts 😄
[2022-07-23T15:16:33] Artem Bulashev: Fishy
[2022-07-23T16:40:46] sombre_enfant: Tbh phase reading is wrong i had 180A many time even its impossible for my battery to give that
[2022-07-23T16:44:30] Кирилл: When your phase going 180A - depends on motors rpm i.e phase voltage is 10V means it will be 1800w per motor. From battery, i.e it has 16s (57.6V) it will be 1800w / 57.6V = 31.25A. Not 180A from battery
[2022-07-23T16:45:39] Artem Bulashev: Not how it works
[2022-07-23T16:45:40] Кирилл: and this calculating without losses
[2022-07-23T16:47:40] Artem Bulashev: Yeap. With efficiency around 90% add 3.125amps to get your vesc report reading = would be 34.4amp to get 180a phase at rpm that corespondent to 10v on motor (that is by your motor kv)
[2022-07-23T16:49:34] sombre_enfant: Its on 13s the thing show both motor right ?
[2022-07-23T22:35:49] Luis Magalhaes: A log should be better to see all happening i think 😜i miss vesc logs 😂
[2022-07-24T01:46:23] rosheee: 20A battery
[2022-07-24T01:50:15] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>

[2022-07-24T16:48:17] rosheee: which ports used ?
[2022-07-24T16:49:15] Paolo ⁭: U inverted tx with rx

[2022-07-24T17:07:30] rosheee: Hmm
[2022-07-24T17:07:35] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-07-24T17:07:52] rosheee: I connected wrong xD lol
[2022-07-24T17:08:18] Mirono escooters: How
[2022-07-24T17:09:16] rosheee: Omfg
[2022-07-24T17:09:19] rosheee: Me retard
[2022-07-24T17:11:43] rosheee: 1 vcc 1 ground 1 rx 1 tx
[2022-07-24T17:12:29] Konstantin: Gg
[2022-07-24T17:12:36] rosheee: Now
[2022-07-24T17:12:37] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-07-24T17:12:44] rosheee: I changed wrong lines
[2022-07-24T17:13:06] rosheee: Perfect thx Now assemble And then assemble 20s
[2022-07-25T19:12:19] rosheee: https://www.dronefpvshop.ch/all-products/mg-chemicals-silicone-conformal-coating-422c-premium/
[2022-07-25T19:45:31] Artem Bulashev: Yes that silicon based conformal coating is best in class
[2022-07-25T19:45:38] Artem Bulashev: It does trap heat though
[2022-07-25T19:45:51] Mirono escooters: You can never waterproof and not trap heat
[2022-07-25T19:45:59] Mirono escooters: Jyst epoxy fill it 😎 Joke
[2022-07-25T19:46:06] Artem Bulashev: Well potting yeah
[2022-07-25T19:46:19] Artem Bulashev: Improves heat exchange and waterproofing
[2022-07-25T19:46:20] Mirono escooters: I once saw batt potted Looked cool, but eh
[2022-07-25T19:46:28] Mirono escooters: Yea ok fair forgot
[2022-07-25T19:46:33] Artem Bulashev: Good luck fixing it 😃😃
[2022-07-25T19:46:41] Mirono escooters: Thats what i thouggt
[2022-07-25T19:46:53] Mirono escooters: I wanna try but not with such a expensive piece of materia
[2022-07-25T19:47:00] Mirono escooters: Maybe a xiaomi controller or a cheapo batt
[2022-07-25T20:15:34] rosheee: What now xD?
[2022-07-25T20:15:51] rosheee: The coated esc with it and put it underwater
[2022-07-25T20:16:16] rosheee: So this stuff ive send is legit
[2022-07-25T20:16:23] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-07-25T20:16:26] rosheee: Good
[2022-07-25T20:17:11] rosheee: That comes over whole esc?
[2022-07-25T20:17:14] rosheee: Everywhere?
[2022-07-25T20:17:55] Mirono escooters: On all components yes
[2022-07-25T20:17:59] Mirono escooters: Ofc not over plugs
[2022-07-25T20:18:57] Artem Bulashev: And not over top of mosfets / mcu - you don’t need it there and having it there would reduce heat transfer
[2022-07-25T20:21:25] rosheee: XD omg
[2022-07-25T20:21:55] rosheee: <photos/photo_5441@25-07-2022_20-21-55.jpg>
[2022-07-25T20:22:10] rosheee: Not over plugs not over mosfets
[2022-07-25T20:22:34] rosheee: Anyone else needs?
[2022-07-25T20:38:32] sombre_enfant: Put everywhere dont worry
[2022-07-25T21:25:25] rosheee: Flipsky declare max current as battery or phase?
[2022-07-25T21:26:09] Mirono escooters: Phase
[2022-07-25T21:31:47] rosheee: Thx
[2022-07-25T21:31:47] rosheee: So battery max for 75100 will be?
[2022-07-25T21:39:34] Artem Bulashev: At 100a phase it likely will take nearly 100a battery
[2022-07-25T21:40:46] Artem Bulashev: But if you push it 120a than likely not over 70a (better 60a)
[2022-07-25T21:41:06] Artem Bulashev: Remember battery amps simply determines up to which rpm full phase will be output.
[2022-07-25T21:42:11] Artem Bulashev: So less battery amps means phase amps won’t be full at all times = temp heat up is amps on fets vs time
[2022-07-25T21:43:48] Gigolo Joe: No problem going 120phase and 120 battery, only issue is fast heating so he'll need a good heatsink
[2022-07-25T21:47:14] Artem Bulashev: Fet Core May over heat faster than it can take heat away
[2022-07-25T21:47:56] Gigolo Joe: Indeed, but it won't cause major issues if u don't set temp limit sky high
[2022-07-25T21:48:40] Gigolo Joe: Positive side is - with high phase and high batt amps u get insane acceleration
[2022-07-25T21:49:15] Mirono escooters: He will
[2022-07-25T21:49:51] Gigolo Joe: Right, i forgot we were talking about RS 🤣🤣🤣
[2022-07-25T22:38:57] rosheee: ah nto for me
[2022-07-25T22:39:17] rosheee: for a friends esc
[2022-07-25T22:43:10] Artem Bulashev: Acceleration will be same up to the point where battery limit start to limit phase current, like up to 25kmh, than you increase battery limit and now you get that acceleration up to 40kmh without reduction
[2022-07-25T22:43:42] Artem Bulashev: I know you know, but may be some one will need that example
[2022-07-26T01:17:33] Mirono escooters: Roschee, new opensource vesc in making, 500a shunts, perhaps something for u. 18 fets
[2022-07-26T01:17:40] Mirono escooters: INCOMING
[2022-07-26T01:17:43] Mirono escooters: And cheep
[2022-07-26T01:17:45] Mirono escooters: In test fasz
[2022-07-26T01:17:57] Mirono escooters: But promising. Im defenitely getting one for myself
[2022-07-26T01:44:06] rosheee: ulala
[2022-07-26T01:44:15] rosheee: send link
[2022-07-26T01:44:35] rosheee: maybe for kaabo
[2022-07-26T01:44:45] rosheee: still nothing delivered by fastride

[2022-07-26T02:11:28] Mirono escooters: Owo
[2022-07-26T07:10:54] Gigolo Joe: Perfect explanation bröther 👌
[2022-07-26T07:38:56] rosheee: He sells a PSU xyd

[2022-07-27T08:57:06] Artem Bulashev: Guys who has ubox 75v dual for sale here ?
[2022-07-27T09:36:24] Face de Pin Sucé: I have one V1
[2022-07-27T13:59:05] Artem Bulashev: New or used ?
[2022-07-27T13:59:15] rosheee: used ofc
[2022-07-27T13:59:18] rosheee: i have used v1 as well ^^
[2022-07-27T13:59:22] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-07-27T13:59:23] rosheee: u want?
[2022-07-27T13:59:28] Artem Bulashev: Red usb c or usb micro ?
[2022-07-27T13:59:32] rosheee: red usb c
[2022-07-27T13:59:38] rosheee: only used with stock fw
[2022-07-27T13:59:47] rosheee: 25'000km
[2022-07-27T13:59:53] rosheee: in best condition
[2022-07-27T14:00:30] Artem Bulashev: Fully working? Why not using ?
[2022-07-27T14:01:06] Face de Pin Sucé: Same, used
[2022-07-27T14:01:19] Face de Pin Sucé: Fully working
[2022-07-27T14:01:23] Face de Pin Sucé: Not using because no more utility x)
[2022-07-27T14:02:08] Artem Bulashev: You guys know that red 75v is using the best fets and amplifier of all Spintend line 😄
[2022-07-27T14:02:28] Artem Bulashev: Shortage is a bitch
[2022-07-27T14:02:44] Artem Bulashev: I will share private conversation, I think you will find it intersting
[2022-07-27T14:03:04] Face de Pin Sucé: 16S sucks

[2022-07-27T14:03:47] Artem Bulashev: Here Spintend explain what happens
[2022-07-27T14:04:13] Artem Bulashev: This was due to my question. About new single 100v they are realizing soon
[2022-07-27T14:04:43] Artem Bulashev: Ok here is spoiler 😄

[2022-07-27T14:06:27] Mirono escooters: How much euro would a 2nd hand spintend be?
[2022-07-27T14:08:21] Oliver Eliasson: Looks nice, they used brass on the metal pad on the bottom right? Why not aluminium or copper, doesn’t aluminium have better thermal connectivity then brass?
[2022-07-27T14:08:56] Mirono escooters: I guess no copper bcs copper on alu (some scoot frames alu)
[2022-07-27T14:09:03] Mirono escooters: But brass. Good question
[2022-07-27T14:09:59] Oliver Eliasson: Yeah true could corrode right? But aluminium should be better still right?
[2022-07-27T14:10:15] Mirono escooters: Not corrode, some bad chemical reaction xd
[2022-07-27T14:10:17] Mirono escooters: I forgot name
[2022-07-27T14:10:25] Mirono escooters: I dont know brass conductivity
[2022-07-27T14:14:28] rosheee: i know
[2022-07-27T14:15:05] rosheee: it sucks u up ❤️
[2022-07-27T14:36:26] Happy Giraffe: Why 100A?🌚
[2022-07-27T14:36:46] Happy Giraffe: Tho case looks better
[2022-07-27T14:37:28] Mirono escooters: Roschee will do 420a
[2022-07-27T14:42:46] Artem Bulashev: Galvanic corrosion yes
[2022-07-27T14:43:20] Artem Bulashev: And yea brass is actually less thermally conductive than aluminum
[2022-07-27T14:43:28] Artem Bulashev: I asked why brass, waiting for reply
[2022-07-27T14:45:13] Artem Bulashev: What ever this means
[2022-07-27T14:46:29] Artem Bulashev: Looks like they got market demand backwards again, brass will be worse in caring heat away than aluminum. I think it may be awesome to mod it with copper heat block instead
[2022-07-27T14:47:02] Artem Bulashev: I don’t know why they used brass block, don’t see any reason why aluminum could not be used
[2022-07-27T14:47:47] Mirono escooters: Why they do such shit
[2022-07-27T14:47:50] Mirono escooters: We always need to mod
[2022-07-27T14:56:32] Valentin Holländer: When going detect foc hallsensor should I = 10A?
[2022-07-27T14:59:44] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5452@27-07-2022_14-59-44.jpg>
[2022-07-27T14:59:52] Artem Bulashev: Looks like brass is canceled 🤣🤣
[2022-07-27T15:00:28] Mirono escooters: Bruh, they dont even check it??
[2022-07-27T15:00:30] Mirono escooters: Engineering
[2022-07-27T15:02:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 🤣🤪👍
[2022-07-27T15:02:25] Artem Bulashev: Well that’s the problem when electrical engineer does all
[2022-07-27T15:02:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: +1
[2022-07-27T15:02:44] Artem Bulashev: Need broad spectrum knowledge
[2022-07-27T15:02:55] Artem Bulashev: That brass also cost them more than whole case
[2022-07-27T15:03:08] Artem Bulashev: Brain fart I guess
[2022-07-27T15:03:12] Artem Bulashev: Shit happens
[2022-07-27T15:04:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for small companies, it's really difficult to have all knowledges to make a complete product. if you don't grow, you can try to outsource some design/engineering, but it costs, and it very difficult to maintain.
[2022-07-27T15:04:45] Mirono escooters: How can we trust em if they make those mistakes xd
[2022-07-27T15:04:56] Mirono escooters: Thats basic googling even
[2022-07-27T15:06:54] rosheee: c0pper really cheap in CN
[2022-07-27T15:06:59] rosheee: cuz they bought all shit
[2022-07-27T16:21:59] Jan: Omg this is an embarassement
[2022-07-27T16:28:49] Mirono escooters: EnGiNeErS
[2022-07-27T16:35:16] Jan: Just full retards
[2022-07-27T16:35:35] Mirono escooters: Spintend weird
[2022-07-27T16:35:46] Jan: <animation>
[2022-07-27T16:47:19] Artem Bulashev: To google it you need to know about that
[2022-07-27T16:48:08] Artem Bulashev: Also sometimes one out of 20 factors can be missed because you concentrated on other factors
[2022-07-27T16:48:46] Mirono escooters: Yes but cmon, atleast google thermal conductivity of a material u wanna use..
[2022-07-27T17:02:28] rosheee: <photos/photo_5453@27-07-2022_17-02-28.jpg>

[2022-07-27T17:03:37] rosheee: China no google
[2022-07-27T17:03:50] rosheee: To google that advanced sk1lls needed
[2022-07-27T17:04:58] rosheee: Btw u saw what in dejans fire was the hardest?
[2022-07-27T17:05:01] rosheee: Zhe still alive

[2022-07-27T17:52:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: roscheee usual cryptic messages. i think i understand 50% of his messages 🤣🤣
[2022-07-27T18:39:24] rosheee: sry
[2022-07-27T18:39:55] rosheee: the guy in vsett chat who lost all scooters and his flat cuz fire in basement
[2022-07-27T18:40:40] rosheee: <photos/photo_5456@27-07-2022_18-40-40.jpg>
[2022-07-27T18:50:31] Artem Bulashev: Yeah he had my yellow VSETT 9 (dual with ubox and dual original battery)
[2022-07-27T18:50:43] Artem Bulashev: So no one in EU has new Ubox to sell?
[2022-07-27T19:04:26] rosheee: Nope
[2022-07-27T19:07:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Really dejans????
[2022-07-27T19:09:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Wtf happened
[2022-07-27T19:12:47] Artem Bulashev: Fire in the storage room
[2022-07-27T19:12:54] Artem Bulashev: My be bad charger
[2022-07-27T19:13:04] rosheee: it was your battery that exploded
[2022-07-27T19:13:19] rosheee: no it wasn't in his basement room it was in some of his neighbours
[2022-07-27T19:13:25] rosheee: and it wasn't your battery :-P
[2022-07-27T19:13:47] rosheee: the fire came from other room then found the way into his part of the basement and then fuckeria started
[2022-07-27T19:14:17] rosheee: just imagen how the fuck all these batteries gone wild holyfck
[2022-07-27T19:14:29] rosheee: at least he gets $$$ now and can build fuckeria scooter or buy fuckeria
[2022-07-27T19:15:13] Jan: Slack Core 920R
[2022-07-27T19:15:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Fuckeria indeed
[2022-07-27T19:15:47] rosheee: then swiss police takes scooter when it arrives in basel
[2022-07-27T19:15:58] rosheee: better he goes g30 ^^
[2022-07-27T19:16:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So not the scooter made the fire basically
[2022-07-27T19:16:24] rosheee: exactly that's what he told me
[2022-07-27T19:16:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: So sad ,he is cool guy who worked ass for does and everything 😒
[2022-07-27T19:17:02] rosheee: word
[2022-07-27T19:18:08] rosheee: but in the end ^^' i pass him all invoices for the scooters i sold him @artBula pls send him also an invoice for what u sold him
[2022-07-27T19:19:54] Artem Bulashev: Hi what?
[2022-07-27T19:21:17] Artem Bulashev: My battery? No, I didn’t have any of my batteries, luckily I delayed the battery he ordered from me.
[2022-07-27T19:21:43] rosheee: XD JUST JOCKED
[2022-07-27T19:21:48] rosheee: but #rip
[2022-07-27T19:22:07] sombre_enfant: Bro should do a quest
[2022-07-27T19:22:11] Artem Bulashev: 👌 yeah crazy amount of power in one room
[2022-07-27T19:22:15] rosheee: ?
[2022-07-27T19:30:38] Mirono escooters: Thats why mine in garden separate from house
[2022-07-27T20:16:52] Unknown: Oof, I have almost 800 cells in my basement. Wild if you've seen just one on 🔥
[2022-07-27T20:19:00] Artem Bulashev: He said he put xiomi on charger and left to make coffee and 30min later dat shit😵‍💫😵‍💫 crazy quick Remember how I said just few days ago, I don’t like going to sleep when batteries are charging 😄 that’s why
[2022-07-27T20:21:39] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2022-07-27T20:23:22] Artem Bulashev: Over charge protection Over current protection on charge Over temp protection on charge Complete battery disconnection from charging and discharging and balancing Short circuited cut off Single cell over voltage protection
[2022-07-27T20:23:52] Artem Bulashev: Smart BMS have all of those - virtually no chance for charger to damage battery.
[2022-07-27T20:26:04] rosheee: So it was scooter then?
[2022-07-27T20:27:07] Artem Bulashev: They say all of the above or some, usually never temp sensors But problem is that some BMS rated 50amps, allow 180amps before they die rather than shut of output - and same on input. Also they have very week voltage protection. If charger goes shit, and feeds 220v out of input (shot) than not every BMS will be able to - react fast enough for cell not to explode frozen over voltage = heat - not get it’s own resistors shot try rough delivering 220v right into balancing leads
[2022-07-27T20:27:25] Artem Bulashev: He doesn’t know. Could have been a coincidence
[2022-07-27T20:27:41] rosheee: Hmm
[2022-07-27T20:29:45] rosheee: That took most damage
[2022-07-27T20:30:40] Artem Bulashev: AntBms, LLT, JKBms, and their rebrands (each has a few rebrand / reliable alternatives)
[2022-07-27T20:31:14] Artem Bulashev: High discharge cells - 4C 2600cells * 2 of such packs
[2022-07-27T20:31:35] Artem Bulashev: It had external battery pack on stem - in textile bag
[2022-07-27T20:31:56] Artem Bulashev: So i can imagine it fought fire well
[2022-07-27T20:33:07] rosheee: Daly?
[2022-07-27T20:35:03] rosheee: Lol did dejan bought new vsett xD?
[2022-07-27T20:35:21] Jan: yes
[2022-07-27T20:36:23] sombre_enfant: No
[2022-07-27T20:36:52] rosheee: What no?
[2022-07-27T20:37:36] Konstantin: Llt top, other's so-so...
[2022-07-27T20:37:44] Konstantin: Test all of them
[2022-07-27T20:38:06] Artem Bulashev: What’s wrong with JKBms?
[2022-07-27T20:38:17] Artem Bulashev: And new AntBms? (Beside app not working on iPhone with new BMSs setting)
[2022-07-27T20:38:24] Konstantin: Jk can't alow set low voltage lower 2.8v, garbage!
[2022-07-27T20:39:07] Artem Bulashev: And you should not discharge bellow on escooter 😄😄
[2022-07-27T20:39:22] Artem Bulashev: But I never noticed
[2022-07-27T20:40:37] Konstantin: Test for setting, all protection, random... 1 bms set to wrong 84v cat off, battery 22s, full 92... And it's fk charge! Test to short , new not test, old ant buum. Fets garbage, not something like protection diode...
[2022-07-27T20:40:48] rosheee: I have done 2.6V on 16S ^^'
[2022-07-27T20:41:08] Artem Bulashev: Look how fast drop is after 3v. There are only 2 cells that I know that have slow slope bellow 3v and are worth being used in that level - 35e, m58t JKBms fets are good, temp super low. Ant I did notice being Warmer yeah
[2022-07-27T20:42:25] Artem Bulashev: I tested jK for short 20 times in one day, still running strong, same with over charge - as soon as one cell goes above, charge is disabled On jK and new ant as well
[2022-07-27T20:43:04] Konstantin: I don't care how fast. I want it... And it's didn't aloe
[2022-07-27T20:43:47] Artem Bulashev: But why if that is like 5% or less and you can’t really get any solid performance because IR is rocket high at that level
[2022-07-27T20:44:06] Konstantin: Set active balance, charge battery, just 2 times press throttle, and good Buy LCD display...
[2022-07-27T20:44:33] Konstantin: Soft + hardware top llt
[2022-07-27T20:44:37] Artem Bulashev: Never used lcd, that is Ant display it JK?
[2022-07-27T20:44:50] Artem Bulashev: Agree also user friendly
[2022-07-27T20:45:00] Artem Bulashev: I like jK app the best though
[2022-07-27T20:45:48] Artem Bulashev: But I like two step warnings/ protection on new ants - like over voltage step one at 4.2v and step 2 full shut down at 4.25
[2022-07-27T20:59:06] rosheee: Looks like 60A bms didnt get hot. So maybe go again for 60A bms xD
[2022-07-27T20:59:13] rosheee: But thiccer wires
[2022-07-27T21:00:36] rosheee: 10awg to much heat/resistance

[2022-07-29T06:17:57] rosheee: 20s

[2022-07-29T06:18:07] rosheee: No
[2022-07-29T06:18:31] Artem Bulashev: Magnets set?
[2022-07-29T06:19:17] Artem Bulashev: There is no way for 20s to spin 180kmh 😅 tire would explode
[2022-07-29T06:19:34] Artem Bulashev: Not all car tires are certified to go 180kmh
[2022-07-29T06:19:51] rosheee: 30
[2022-07-29T06:20:35] Artem Bulashev: Hm well road test is needed I guess :))
[2022-07-29T06:20:39] rosheee: Yes

[2022-07-29T06:22:00] rosheee: Its 2 big..

[2022-07-29T09:49:08] Oliver Eliasson: This is my favourite, think maybe sandblasted wheel (if possible) for more rough surface and better grip. Will look more matt also so fits nice with frame
[2022-07-29T10:14:04] Oliver Eliasson: Can you make render of black case and spintend orange wheel and button?
[2022-07-29T11:06:39] Izuna 生活: What values are you using for V_REG, VIN_R1, VIN_R2. I need much more accurate voltage reading, but I think 0.4 is still too much.

[2022-07-29T12:56:49] Artem Bulashev: Anodizing requires Sendblasting - it’s the first step, so don’t worry 😊❤️
[2022-07-29T12:57:20] Artem Bulashev: Orange ? Sure, why orange ?
[2022-07-29T12:57:38] Mirono escooters: I want all colors now
[2022-07-29T12:57:40] Mirono escooters: 😪
[2022-07-29T12:59:55] Artem Bulashev: So far those 2 colors go for 92% of replies - 4 of them are black with naked aluminum accents (people plan to locally anodize it into color they like, Because wheel and button is uncoated thus ready to be anodized)

[2022-07-29T13:06:21] Mirono escooters: Na i buy 69 of pink
[2022-07-29T13:09:56] Artem Bulashev: You can get anodizing locally or do it your self at home - see in youtube tons of videos about it. Simply get black with naked aluminum accents
[2022-07-29T13:11:00] Artem Bulashev: I checked in Austria there are guys who offer to do anodizing for 10$ for small part
[2022-07-29T13:21:50] Oliver Eliasson: Spintend color. Maybe looks like linus tech tips though with second thought😅

[2022-07-29T15:44:37] Luis Magalhaes: I like it 😱
[2022-07-29T15:44:53] Jan: Be aware that the temperatures are wrong. This is due to an effect called black body radiation emissivity. The epsilon coefficient varies with different materials and surface grades and can throw your measurement off by a lot that it is no longer valid.
[2022-07-29T15:45:35] Jan: Totally viable solution if you do it right
[2022-07-29T15:46:38] Jan: This is just an example table. Do not measure it like this if you did not coat the whole surface in the same material https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emissivity https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body#:~:text=Real%20materials%20emit%20energy%20at,has%20an%20emissivity%20%CE%B5%20%3D%201.
[2022-07-29T15:46:50] Mirono escooters: I can set them, and did it accordingly
[2022-07-29T15:47:31] Jan: If you have a cam that can set it for each surface and you know the values, than its enough accurate 👌
[2022-07-29T15:47:56] Mirono escooters: Yes, i can set it, its at 0.9 (heatsink and motor black anodized alu)
[2022-07-29T15:48:09] Jan: Else calibrated direct contact thermocouple is the easiest for accurate measurements
[2022-07-29T15:48:25] Mirono escooters: Yea. But i like thermal image xd
[2022-07-29T15:48:28] Jan: ^^

[2022-07-30T01:09:42] rosheee: unplug replug
[2022-07-30T01:09:49] rosheee: like last tme
[2022-07-30T01:09:49] sombre_enfant: Wheel are locked it braked hard
[2022-07-30T01:09:53] rosheee: oh
[2022-07-30T01:09:58] Gigolo Joe: RIP
[2022-07-30T01:10:06] sombre_enfant: Nah fuck
[2022-07-30T01:10:09] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-07-30T01:10:14] sombre_enfant: I need to go work tomorrow
[2022-07-30T01:10:24] rosheee: buy littlef0cer
[2022-07-30T02:30:13] sombre_enfant: Goodbye
[2022-07-30T02:57:21] Mirko Boni: What happened?
[2022-07-30T03:07:34] rosheee: What sh00ped?
[2022-07-30T05:53:53] Izuna 生活: heeyyy
[2022-07-30T05:53:58] Izuna 生活: the same happens to me
[2022-07-30T05:54:01] Izuna 生活: Every fucking time
[2022-07-30T05:56:08] Izuna 生活: the clip of it (something was wrong with it when I uploaded it yesterday, don't know).
[2022-07-30T05:56:25] Izuna 生活: Seems Flipsky 75100 does not like BMS cutting out at all, why the fuck?
[2022-07-30T08:17:08] sombre_enfant: Same what mosfet i could put ? Did u replaced yourself yet ?
[2022-07-30T08:29:32] Izuna 生活: I would recommend to put HUASHUO HSP0076A (100V 308A 429W 1.8mΩ). They seemed for the while I was testing them very good (until my bms cutted out lol). https://datasheet.lcsc.com/lcsc/2110221130_HUASHUO-HSP0076A_C2903573.pdf
[2022-07-30T12:43:53] sombre_enfant: 200
[2022-07-30T12:43:56] sombre_enfant: Each
[2022-07-30T13:05:10] Gigolo Joe: How about battery amps?
[2022-07-30T13:07:06] sombre_enfant: 80 maximum
[2022-07-30T13:12:03] Gigolo Joe: Baby numbers
[2022-07-30T13:13:11] Gigolo Joe: Why so low tho?
[2022-07-30T13:15:31] sombre_enfant: 80A is high enough
[2022-07-30T13:22:55] Mirono escooters: Meh
[2022-07-30T13:45:03] Gigolo Joe: Nope
[2022-07-30T13:45:39] Gigolo Joe: 100 is high enough 120 is even better 150 is 🥵
[2022-07-30T13:46:32] Gigolo Joe: Take an example - nucular 12f: 150 battery and 250 phase. These are bic boi numbers
[2022-07-30T13:57:07] sombre_enfant: Trippin
[2022-07-30T13:57:50] sombre_enfant: Im sure it dont pull that on bms
[2022-07-30T13:58:23] Mirono escooters: Bluetooth bms check it.. im sure xd
[2022-07-30T14:01:22] sombre_enfant: Only ebike/moto hub can handle that
[2022-07-30T14:03:58] Mirono escooters: Adam
[2022-07-30T14:05:03] sombre_enfant: He will kill his motor for sure
[2022-07-30T14:05:41] Mirono escooters: He has temp sensors, and he is not overheating..
[2022-07-30T14:05:44] Mirono escooters: He knows what he do
[2022-07-30T14:19:50] Happy Giraffe: I used 50A batt on single motor😂
[2022-07-30T14:56:52] Artem Bulashev: Hi man your won’t need more than 180a on rear motor, VSETT 10+ motor won’t like it much, also to even touch for 1 sec 200a phase you need 100a battery setting, other wise you won’t get to it
[2022-07-30T14:56:56] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5488@30-07-2022_14-56-56.jpg>
[2022-07-30T14:57:07] Artem Bulashev: Hope it helps
[2022-07-30T15:12:08] Thierry: I'm not so convinced of the soldering quality of flipsky 75100. Do you perform some improvement except changing mosfet by HSP0076A?
[2022-07-30T15:15:34] Mirono escooters: Rlly? Ö
[2022-07-30T15:15:49] Mirono escooters: More then fine soldering
[2022-07-30T15:15:52] sombre_enfant: U can bridge the track with solder even with copper, but tbh its not needed at all
[2022-07-30T15:16:27] sombre_enfant: Also its alu solder dont really stick to it
[2022-07-30T15:21:09] Thierry: Ok thanks so I will let it as it is and maybe change mosfet later, I have enough to do with vesc stuff
[2022-07-30T15:25:37] Mirono escooters: Alu gets a protective layer ontop (al2) u need to scratch it to get to the pure aluminium
[2022-07-30T15:34:43] sombre_enfant: The stock mosfet are really good, just avoid bad bms, battery, bad setting or they blow
[2022-07-30T15:35:12] sombre_enfant: I killed 4 mos out of 12
[2022-07-30T15:37:44] Mirono escooters: Or undervoltage with alot of amps
[2022-07-30T15:46:30] sombre_enfant: 🧑🏾‍🌾🤨
[2022-07-30T15:56:23] Thierry: I'm in testing phase, 16s and monorim 500w so amps should not be an issue. I will try to switch my awd to awd flipsky with ble support from 1zuna.
[2022-07-30T16:15:36] Unknown: What is best method to make bolt holes on m365 for vesc and battery? I have tried tap n die method but i think its too weak if you make thread only to that first layer
[2022-07-30T16:32:55] Mirono escooters: Tapping is what we do
[2022-07-30T16:57:53] asyan4ik: 7510 with alu.:)
[2022-07-30T17:00:05] Mirono escooters: Lovely
[2022-07-30T17:38:27] sombre_enfant: The flat one ?
[2022-07-30T18:35:57] Paolo ⁭: Xd at 8kmh
[2022-07-30T18:36:38] Paolo ⁭: Show us the temp when u are at 90kmh

[2022-07-30T18:47:14] HTTP(s) Boost: Does anyone know these guys?
[2022-07-30T18:49:30] Artem Bulashev: Correct with higher s count battery same battery amp limit will will get you further before reducing equal amount of phase amps
[2022-07-30T18:51:02] Artem Bulashev: Not really but even big names like Spintend and flipsky can’t not get QC high enough for us to enjoy it carelessly
[2022-07-30T18:52:50] Izuna 生活: Just unsoldered mine (cuz I killed them lol), gonna place in new ones again.
[2022-07-30T18:54:48] Izuna 生活: It literally looks like Flipsky 75100 😅, very likely it is.
[2022-07-30T19:12:05] Mirono escooters: But cheaper?
[2022-07-30T19:12:13] HTTP(s) Boost: Yep, the only difference I've noticed is the capacitors. Richcap on Flipsky, and Rubycon on this one
[2022-07-30T19:12:14] Mirono escooters: I mean 75100 flipsky co0ied it So they copied the copy
[2022-07-30T19:12:27] Izuna 生活: No, not cheaper sadly.
[2022-07-30T19:13:09] Mirono escooters: 90€ is already cheep
[2022-07-30T19:13:23] Izuna 生活: Flipsky 75100 on Banggood is like ~88€, this one is 94€
[2022-07-30T19:13:51] Izuna 生活: <photos/photo_5491@30-07-2022_19-13-51.jpg>
[2022-07-30T19:14:17] Izuna 生活: But every time it gets more expensive... 😐
[2022-07-30T19:15:07] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_5492@30-07-2022_19-15-07.jpg>
[2022-07-30T19:15:15] HTTP(s) Boost: This one is about 20$ cheaper than Flipsky
[2022-07-30T19:15:15] Mirono escooters: F
[2022-07-30T19:15:28] Mirono escooters: Without taxes..
[2022-07-30T19:15:38] Mirono escooters: Banggood best price
[2022-07-30T19:16:06] Izuna 生活: Not for me. It is 94€ for me, is yours without tax etc?
[2022-07-30T19:16:18] Mirono escooters: No vat included

[2022-07-30T19:18:29] Mirono escooters: Europa greedy fuckers
[2022-07-30T19:20:02] Izuna 生活: I miss the tax-free limit 😭
[2022-07-30T19:25:22] rosheee: just for the guys who say "deadzone throttle"
[2022-07-30T19:25:23] rosheee: <photos/photo_5495@30-07-2022_19-25-23.jpg>
[2022-07-30T19:25:49] Mirono escooters: Me too bud
[2022-07-30T19:27:56] Thierry: Keep mine in case of need 😅 currently I'm only doing test on air so not that much amps. This morning I compiled your updated soft and the motor is not anymore doing crackling when throttling only when I turn wheel forward with hand 👍 Next step is to adapt your lisp for awd and try can between vesc
[2022-07-30T19:29:27] Izuna 生活: Great, for your AWD use "canset-set-current-rel" etc, if you don't know how just contact me. I have a modified script for AWD already made for @lBabacar
[2022-07-30T19:34:24] Thierry: Thanks for your support I will probably need help. I know that you made the script for awd and download it on forum. With which config do you use flipsky?
[2022-07-30T19:35:52] Izuna 生活: No, the script is not public, but I can send it to you. I would only need to know the VESC Can ID of the second VESC. I use my Flipsky with 72V battery and with 1200w high kv motor.
[2022-07-30T19:39:00] Izuna 生活: <files/m365_dash_awd_edition(change_vesc_id).lisp>
[2022-07-30T19:39:25] Izuna 生活: Here, just change this to the id of the second VESC.
[2022-07-30T19:39:40] sombre_enfant: Now 72v damn u gotta be flyin
[2022-07-30T19:39:52] Izuna 生活: no, not with my current BMS doing shit
[2022-07-30T19:40:49] Izuna 生活: and before I increase power and kill it once again, I gotta fix my second VESC.
[2022-07-30T19:42:11] sombre_enfant: I wonder if i put magnachip mdp1932
[2022-07-30T19:42:57] Izuna 生活: At least I can finally fix them myself, with the bigger tip it works so good. Just need to get some good amount of spare MOSFETs.
[2022-07-30T19:43:02] Paolo ⁭: Isnt it worse than stock one?
[2022-07-30T19:43:11] Izuna 生活: I think he doesn't have any other.
[2022-07-30T19:43:34] sombre_enfant: I have a shit ton of them
[2022-07-30T19:59:44] Thierry: Sounds powerfull. I'm curious to see if u can feel difference between stock esc and flipsky
[2022-07-30T20:01:38] Thierry: Thanks I will try it but first I'm trying to understand how vesc and lisp work together. It is not clear how power limit and battery/motor settings are working together.
[2022-07-30T20:03:03] Mirono escooters: Wich stock esc?
[2022-07-30T20:03:09] Mirono escooters: Ofc you feel difference..
[2022-07-30T20:05:46] Thierry: M365 one
[2022-07-30T20:06:10] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse you feel a difference 🙈😂
[2022-07-30T20:06:19] Thierry: Will see but on air same top speed
[2022-07-30T20:06:29] Mirono escooters: Ofco
[2022-07-30T20:06:37] Mirono escooters: Top speed is determined by voltage..
[2022-07-30T20:06:46] Mirono escooters: You will get more power
[2022-07-30T20:06:52] Mirono escooters: But stock motor and vesc.. not worth it
[2022-07-30T20:07:17] Thierry: Yes I know but it is a first step
[2022-07-30T20:07:23] Mirono escooters: Yes true
[2022-07-30T20:07:43] Mirono escooters: Upgrade battery higher v for more speed For now do higher phase amps good torque
[2022-07-30T20:08:09] Thierry: I'm looking for bigger motor which could be installed on m365 without cutting frame
[2022-07-30T20:08:20] Mirono escooters: Impossible. Sry
[2022-07-30T20:08:22] Mirono escooters: Get suspension
[2022-07-30T20:08:35] Thierry: I'm currently on 16s but planned to move to 20s.
[2022-07-30T20:08:42] Mirono escooters: Ok
[2022-07-30T20:08:51] Thierry: Front?
[2022-07-30T20:08:53] Mirono escooters: High kv motor prob dont need 20s haha
[2022-07-30T20:09:01] Mirono escooters: Or rear.. u can fit motors either way
[2022-07-30T20:09:11] Mirono escooters: U need dual suspension anyway for high speed..
[2022-07-30T20:09:41] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_5497@30-07-2022_20-09-41.jpg>
[2022-07-30T20:09:41] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_5498@30-07-2022_20-09-41.jpg>
[2022-07-30T20:09:43] Mirono escooters: 500w kugoo
[2022-07-30T20:09:45] Mirono escooters: M365 frame
[2022-07-30T20:09:53] Mirono escooters: Or 1200w blade in front super nice upgrade
[2022-07-30T20:10:58] Thierry: From aliexpress? What is top speed with 16s?
[2022-07-30T20:11:19] Mirono escooters: @PaoloWu
[2022-07-30T20:11:21] Mirono escooters: Idk
[2022-07-30T20:11:28] Mirono escooters: Mine isnt assembled yet.
[2022-07-30T20:14:10] Thierry: You bought them at Paolo right?
[2022-07-30T20:14:27] Mirono escooters: I didnt, i got the one from @Happy_Giraffe But yes motor from paolo
[2022-07-30T20:19:20] Thierry: So many project
[2022-07-30T20:20:14] Mirono escooters: 🧐 ok... Possibly they're just going bang because the control loop goes mad when the battery shuts off, but tbh it'll be hard to know unless someone can salvage a log file from the mess. MOSFETs die because 1) over voltage 2) over current 3) partial turn on I don't think there's any other cause. Apart from hitting them with a hammer.
[2022-07-30T20:20:17] Mirono escooters: About 75100
[2022-07-30T20:21:52] Thierry: Maybe also remove kapton and replace it by thermal pad
[2022-07-30T20:22:33] Mirono escooters: Meh
[2022-07-30T20:22:39] Mirono escooters: That's not its problemo
[2022-07-30T20:25:09] Mirono escooters: I mean... This could just be because it has bat shit insane abs max overcurrent values... 450A iirc
[2022-07-30T20:28:36] sombre_enfant: 190A abs
[2022-07-30T20:28:51] Mirono escooters: Ok so just shit circuit design
[2022-07-30T20:28:57] Mirono escooters: Id add caps see if it helps
[2022-07-30T20:29:08] sombre_enfant: Nope
[2022-07-30T20:29:27] Mirono escooters: Ok shit design
[2022-07-30T20:29:35] sombre_enfant: Yeah
[2022-07-30T20:29:56] Mirono escooters: F. Was good vesc
[2022-07-30T20:31:33] Mirono escooters: It sort of makes sense why after a cutoff during acceleration the induced voltage will spike even higher than during ebraking . You just pumped some extra current into a magnetic field
[2022-07-30T20:31:38] Mirono escooters: Makes sense..
[2022-07-30T21:05:28] Artem Bulashev: Wanted yo upgrade my spot welder to internally step up 7v to 12v
[2022-07-30T21:05:40] Artem Bulashev: That Chinese shit made -0.2v instead.
[2022-07-30T21:05:56] Artem Bulashev: So I fed it 90v to see how it burns ❤️
[2022-07-30T21:05:59] Artem Bulashev: <animation>
[2022-07-30T21:06:05] Artem Bulashev: Was spectacular
[2022-07-30T21:06:26] Artem Bulashev: Still need step up though. 😄😂
[2022-07-30T21:06:27] Gigolo Joe: On 75100?
[2022-07-30T21:06:54] Artem Bulashev: This is the 75100 flat with aluminum pcb
[2022-07-30T21:07:00] Artem Bulashev: 200a phase 100a battery
[2022-07-30T21:07:11] Artem Bulashev: Temp rise is pretty slow
[2022-07-30T21:07:26] Artem Bulashev: It is more than it likes of course
[2022-07-30T21:07:34] Mirono escooters: Oh lovely
[2022-07-30T21:08:31] Artem Bulashev: I wonder if you can take it off the case and put it down to scooter
[2022-07-30T21:08:39] Artem Bulashev: That with better paste
[2022-07-30T21:09:05] Artem Bulashev: Nd than small 40mm fan should make 180/70 continues sustainable
[2022-07-30T21:13:07] Mirono escooters: Me wonder too

[2022-07-30T21:31:36] sombre_enfant: The new one
[2022-07-30T21:31:40] Gigolo Joe: Ohhh
[2022-07-30T21:32:30] Paolo ⁭: Much better cooling than spintend
[2022-07-30T21:33:20] Paolo ⁭: They are cooling the real heating surface😂 if they edit design and made aluminium touch top of mosfet too, the cooling will be super
[2022-07-30T21:33:47] Paolo ⁭: You made it for speed or torque?

[2022-08-02T23:17:46] Artem Bulashev: 🤣🤣
[2022-08-02T23:21:37] Luis Magalhaes: 🤣🤣
[2022-08-02T23:25:32] rosheee: Word
[2022-08-03T17:48:29] rosheee: Crap compared to mt8 or 7 levers
[2022-08-03T17:48:29] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-08-03T19:51:10] Paolo ⁭: Seems sucé
[2022-08-03T19:51:35] Paolo ⁭: @SibClimb ‘s motor with upgraded cover
[2022-08-03T19:54:42] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-08-03T19:54:52] rosheee: Send link
[2022-08-03T19:55:37] rosheee: Kidnap @koxx3 and @SibClimb Then they produce controllers and displays
[2022-08-03T20:15:52] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes it is
[2022-08-03T20:17:45] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't
[2022-08-03T20:28:34] Luis Magalhaes: Looks good 😁
[2022-08-03T20:39:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lol
[2022-08-03T20:44:54] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb but your motor was developed with numo?
[2022-08-03T20:45:15] Luis Magalhaes: Or they are using just same motor now?
[2022-08-03T20:45:25] Face de Pin Sucé: It's same motor for everyone
[2022-08-03T20:45:49] Face de Pin Sucé: But Numo now doesn't want people to know it's same motor
[2022-08-03T20:45:54] Face de Pin Sucé: So they made new covers
[2022-08-03T20:56:41] Luis Magalhaes: Hum ok, they are saying that some motors have a temperature problem and they are designing a new motor without that problem etc 😅
[2022-08-03T20:57:22] Luis Magalhaes: Its what a friend of mine was saying he talks to him some times
[2022-08-03T21:45:55] Paolo ⁭: Xd
[2022-08-03T21:46:39] Paolo ⁭: Seems even diecasted xd

[2022-08-03T21:48:41] Luis Magalhaes: 😂
[2022-08-03T21:48:59] Luis Magalhaes: Your pushing it too hard
[2022-08-03T21:49:15] Luis Magalhaes: Use 30A batt and 50A phase 😂
[2022-08-03T21:52:34] Paolo ⁭: Same I told u
[2022-08-03T21:52:48] rosheee: XD
[2022-08-03T21:52:54] rosheee: I had 85 degrees with their conteollees
[2022-08-03T21:53:02] rosheee: Their engineer said temps are good
[2022-08-03T21:58:33] Paolo ⁭: And later u get they are gal thompson with 1337 voips
[2022-08-03T23:02:14] Кирилл: Omg what is wrong with em lol
[2022-08-03T23:15:03] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-08-03T23:16:32] Jan: For being waterproof, how would you rate this?
[2022-08-03T23:16:46] Jan: 12kW pull over 1minute total
[2022-08-03T23:16:50] Jan: Ambient 25°C

[2022-08-03T23:18:32] Paolo ⁭: @roscheeee a Italian friend burned both TRONIC with 250a settings phase current When bms turn on again the TRONIC goes fireworks
[2022-08-03T23:18:43] rosheee: XD
[2022-08-03T23:19:06] rosheee: he doesn't believe us cuz it's g30
[2022-08-03T23:19:08] Paolo ⁭: Effective mos temp: 1337
[2022-08-03T23:19:20] rosheee: and we didn't spend millions ^^'
[2022-08-03T23:19:28] rosheee: and use 10" 1400w motors
[2022-08-03T23:19:42] rosheee: let's see what they say to spintend 16s5p 60a bms 10kw fuckeria xD
[2022-08-03T23:19:53] rosheee: worst was 😆
[2022-08-03T23:20:02] rosheee: without field weakening i achieved 91kmh full throttle
[2022-08-03T23:20:22] Jan: next project, G30 with 24s
[2022-08-03T23:20:23] Paolo ⁭: I tried today fuckeria motor on g30
[2022-08-03T23:20:31] rosheee: i mean yes @AJAJ1992
[2022-08-03T23:20:34] rosheee: he said it needs airflow
[2022-08-03T23:20:45] Paolo ⁭: Just don’t fit for 5mm
[2022-08-03T23:20:47] Paolo ⁭: 😭
[2022-08-03T23:20:49] rosheee: then we put 24S on stem + internal 24S
[2022-08-03T23:20:53] rosheee: 1 24S per motor
[2022-08-03T23:21:03] rosheee: with controllers outside directly cooled by air + silver
[2022-08-03T23:21:16] Paolo ⁭: What sense if you say now can’t push full throttle?
[2022-08-03T23:21:23] rosheee: we can
[2022-08-03T23:21:28] rosheee: after 70kmh
[2022-08-03T23:21:35] rosheee: and with less air pressure
[2022-08-03T23:21:44] Jan: this is starting to become the next joke after "you need a steering damper breh", but he has not seen how my concept works
[2022-08-03T23:21:51] Paolo ⁭: Xd exist traction control on vesc
[2022-08-03T23:21:54] rosheee: @PaoloWu the real project background is...we wanna build a drift scooter
[2022-08-03T23:22:00] rosheee: yes
[2022-08-03T23:22:21] rosheee: i've asked 4 times now after their temps @ rion
[2022-08-03T23:22:23] Paolo ⁭: <animation>
[2022-08-03T23:22:33] rosheee: i bet they have similar temps
[2022-08-03T23:22:49] rosheee: i've used their controllers with original case on aluplate @ kaabo
[2022-08-03T23:22:56] rosheee: reached 60-70C
[2022-08-03T23:23:00] rosheee: outside mounted
[2022-08-03T23:24:34] Paolo ⁭: No enough 100kmh?
[2022-08-03T23:24:43] Jan: no
[2022-08-03T23:24:50] Jan: 120kmh was minimum target
[2022-08-03T23:25:02] rosheee: yes
[2022-08-03T23:25:03] Jan: 140kmh aspirational
[2022-08-03T23:25:05] rosheee: 100kmg no prob

[2022-08-03T23:25:28] rosheee: i put on motec next time
[2022-08-03T23:25:30] Paolo ⁭: Xd
[2022-08-03T23:25:41] rosheee: and we need @artBula throttle
[2022-08-03T23:25:41] Paolo ⁭: Send dragy
[2022-08-03T23:25:48] rosheee: to do burnout front and rear motor to heat up tires
[2022-08-03T23:25:49] Jan: i currently focus on fender design until battery arrives for mine
[2022-08-03T23:25:50] rosheee: then fucekria
[2022-08-03T23:26:11] Jan: before Rion claims patent violation
[2022-08-03T23:26:20] rosheee: they can't
[2022-08-03T23:26:23] rosheee: cuz iz's in china
[2022-08-03T23:26:24] rosheee: XD
[2022-08-03T23:26:31] rosheee: gl hf
[2022-08-03T23:27:30] Paolo ⁭: Maybe before China can do something
[2022-08-03T23:27:39] Paolo ⁭: Now usa is in war with China 😂
[2022-08-03T23:27:50] Paolo ⁭: Then 0% prob with these problem

[2022-08-04T23:19:58] Ofek 🐥: Thermal cutoff at 75°C I Have to cool them fets faster 🙈😄 (Flipsky 75100 with custom heatsink)
[2022-08-04T23:24:58] Jan: At what power and for how long?
[2022-08-04T23:25:15] Jan: Is this 4digit watts?
[2022-08-04T23:25:45] Ofek 🐥: I will add the log tomorrow 5.5kw peak
[2022-08-04T23:27:14] Ofek 🐥: <photos/photo_5538@04-08-2022_23-27-14.jpg>
[2022-08-04T23:27:40] Jan: Picture of cooling solution?
[2022-08-05T00:58:34] sombre_enfant: Cooling ?
[2022-08-05T05:02:35] Izuna 生活: That is so awesome. 😄 I would recommend to replace the MOSFETs, if you are using the stock Flipsky 75100 (not the Alu PCB one, this one already has good ones). With the stock MOSFETs, I feel like you can have the best cooling solution, but the MOSFETs will still heat up enough itself because the heat won't dissipate fast enough to the heatsink. (does that make sense?) At least from my testing I noticed with my huge copper heatsink, they will stay much cooler, but still heat up very quickly and strong. As soon as I decrease power/cut power they are almost instantaneous to normal temperature. Which is very good, so my heatsink does work, but not enough thermal conductivity at the MOSFETs to keep them cool at full power. I have Kaptontape with Thermal Paste, maybe Thermal Pads would be better or put heatsink also above MOSFETs for even more surface area? 😅 I have a modified Flipsky 75100 with HUASHUO HSP0076A (100V 308A 429W 1.8mΩ) MOSFETs, which I am going to try soon with my copper heatsink and then I'll see how it performs. I already used it with the stock aluminium heatsink, but had a lil accident with my BMS which killed the ESC, so had to repair it first. 😅
[2022-08-05T07:20:28] Ofek 🐥: Thanks bro!! When I stop accelerating the heatsink pull the heat from the mosfets. I tried cheap thermal pads but settled on thermal paste + kapton until I'll get higher quality thermal pads 😅
[2022-08-05T08:59:08] Jan: Its not really about materials, if your cooling concept is wrong, it will not compensate that much with better materials
[2022-08-05T09:00:38] Jan: Good advice: Make thermal energy transfer distances as short as possible.
[2022-08-05T09:32:03] Ofek 🐥: Here's the heatsink
[2022-08-05T09:32:34] Mirono escooters: Why the fins? Is there a fan?
[2022-08-05T09:33:30] Ofek 🐥: No fan, airflow
[2022-08-05T09:33:48] Mirono escooters: Oh
[2022-08-05T09:34:07] Mirono escooters: Hmm yea that heatsink mass is never enough and aircooling takes time
[2022-08-05T09:34:12] Mirono escooters: Still cool design
[2022-08-05T09:34:58] Ofek 🐥: Thanks! I repurposed that heatsink from Induction stove 😂
[2022-08-05T09:35:20] Mirono escooters: Haha 🙈😂 always repurpose stuff
[2022-08-05T10:59:16] Jan: 2mm aluminium 50x50mm is already enough thermal mass to reduce spikes.
[2022-08-05T10:59:31] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-08-05T10:59:32] Jan: This is not going to work
[2022-08-05T10:59:41] Mirono escooters: But not continously what he is doin
[2022-08-05T11:00:00] Jan: You have no heat exchange. You pump it just in the sink but dont extract it from the system(scooter)
[2022-08-05T11:01:26] Jan: Screw the mosfet directly on the bottom plate with very little thermalpaste (thinnest film possible) thats all
[2022-08-05T11:01:43] Jan: No airflow
[2022-08-05T11:02:52] Ofek 🐥: not enough 😁
[2022-08-05T11:10:44] Jan: Its basically zero
[2022-08-05T11:13:52] Ofek 🐥: While riding easy the temp lowers, so there is some airflow
[2022-08-05T11:15:54] Jan: Ah wait thats the stem
[2022-08-05T11:15:57] Jan: Ok there is some airflow
[2022-08-05T11:16:07] Jan: But you block most of it because you made a cavity
[2022-08-05T11:17:24] Jan: The fins have to be in free air.
[2022-08-05T11:23:32] Izuna 生活: This is my cooling solution on my xiaomi PRO2 @Calip3r

[2022-08-05T11:24:36] Ofek 🐥: thanks!
[2022-08-05T11:24:49] Izuna 生活: Doesn't have to be copper, aluminium is good.
[2022-08-05T11:25:10] Izuna 生活: I should have used aluminium, because you shouldn't mix aluminium and copper ... But well now it's too late
[2022-08-05T11:25:25] Ofek 🐥: I want to keep it looks like stock scooter, cant get the fins out
[2022-08-05T11:25:46] Jan: You can paint the fins black
[2022-08-05T11:26:17] Jan: Or install de controller in the floor plate of the scooter
[2022-08-05T11:26:24] Jan: Depends on space
[2022-08-05T11:26:25] Ofek 🐥: If it works you dont have to worry.. 😛
[2022-08-05T11:27:09] Ofek 🐥: no space in my scooter, 72/28 takes every mm inside 🥸
[2022-08-05T11:27:16] Jan: Ok
[2022-08-05T11:28:48] Jan: Galvanic corrosion in contact with water
[2022-08-05T11:42:03] Mirono escooters: Sry for out of subject I cant get my head around led choices. Internet is no help 2835 vs 5050 leds 5050 is rgb. 2835 is 3 colors What is even the advantage of 2835?? Same price.. brighter? Idk
[2022-08-05T11:43:59] Ofek 🐥: I usually use 5050 ws2812 addressable LEDs
[2022-08-05T11:44:22] Mirono escooters: I dont have the money to light my whole room with ws2812
[2022-08-05T11:44:27] Mirono escooters: So im looking for basic leds, xd
[2022-08-05T12:04:51] Ofek 🐥: For a room i'd go with 5050 rgb Make sure you are using multiple power supplies, the brightness different between leds can be significant
[2022-08-05T12:05:26] Mirono escooters: Ok
[2022-08-05T15:46:13] Izuna 生活: Hey, I wanted to increase my phase ampere / motor current further again, it is currently set to 105A, so following: I noticed how the motor starts vibrating when using more than 105A of motor current, now I am wondering what this could be, cable resistance? Bad contact on phase connector? VESC is Flipsky 75100 with latest 6.0 firmware
[2022-08-05T15:47:26] Izuna 生活: Because before that, I have used another Flipsky 75100 with 130A motor current with similar issue, but less noticeable and only at over ~125A.
[2022-08-05T15:51:15] Gigolo Joe: היידההה
[2022-08-05T15:57:44] sombre_enfant: Personally i dont have this issue
[2022-08-05T15:57:53] Izuna 生活: hm shit, a me issue
[2022-08-05T15:58:13] Izuna 生活: did not have it that bad before, but with the hills here very noticeable
[2022-08-05T16:03:45] Gigolo Joe: BIG BOI battery

[2022-08-05T16:08:29] Face de Pin Sucé: I love this controller 🥰
[2022-08-05T16:24:49] Gigolo Joe: One is the triangle No space at back
[2022-08-05T16:25:23] Gigolo Joe: <photos/photo_5549@05-08-2022_16-25-23.jpg>
[2022-08-05T16:25:54] Jan: Its 72x84mm controller
[2022-08-05T16:26:04] Jan: Fits easy
[2022-08-05T16:26:26] Gigolo Joe: <animation>
[2022-08-05T16:26:37] Jan: Is that @roscheeee 's ?
[2022-08-05T16:26:42] Gigolo Joe: Nope
[2022-08-05T16:35:24] Jan: Breh 😅
[2022-08-05T16:35:42] Jan: Sure its more than 72x84mm
[2022-08-05T16:36:01] Jan: The oxo is like half a meter wide
[2022-08-05T16:36:11] Face de Pin Sucé: Nono haha
[2022-08-05T16:37:28] Gigolo Joe: Lol what? It's not
[2022-08-05T16:42:09] Artem Bulashev: Wonder how it will is that the new flat one with aluminium PCB?
[2022-08-05T16:46:16] Ofek 🐥: Flipsky 75100 v2
[2022-08-05T16:48:33] Artem Bulashev: Can you show photos
[2022-08-05T16:48:37] Artem Bulashev: Which one
[2022-08-05T16:48:52] Artem Bulashev: Because I think easiest solution is deal with heat at the source
[2022-08-05T16:48:58] Artem Bulashev: = better fets
[2022-08-05T16:49:43] Artem Bulashev: Also also how many S count is your battery? 19s? 75100 is ok with your voltage ?
[2022-08-05T16:50:11] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5550@05-08-2022_16-50-11.jpg>
[2022-08-05T16:50:28] Artem Bulashev: This one has a lot better cooling from fets and can do 200a phase
[2022-08-05T16:51:00] Artem Bulashev: Best cooling fets solution from all vesc at the moment + good low IR fets
[2022-08-05T16:51:19] Artem Bulashev: There will be be 100v single ubox comming out soon btw
[2022-08-05T16:52:26] rosheee: No
[2022-08-05T16:57:13] Thierry: This how I installed them. I will print some fixation, know it is hold together with kapton
[2022-08-05T16:58:30] Paolo ⁭: I think that’s no good cooling solution, two flipsky cooled with that little surface is no enough.
[2022-08-05T17:00:30] rosheee: Moooore surface
[2022-08-05T17:00:39] rosheee: Absolute word
[2022-08-05T17:00:56] Thierry: It is screwed in place of original xiami esc so directly on the frame. I just performed some test with monorim 500w and max 43°C
[2022-08-05T17:01:08] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-08-05T17:01:16] rosheee: With what battery and amps?
[2022-08-05T17:01:18] rosheee: 30A,
[2022-08-05T17:02:39] rosheee: Others of us tested with 10kw-15kw and had same temps or 10 more or less
[2022-08-05T17:03:09] rosheee: What thermalpads used?
[2022-08-05T17:03:33] Thierry: Less much much less
[2022-08-05T17:04:10] Thierry: It is my first try with vesc tool so everything is not clear for me
[2022-08-05T17:04:27] rosheee: No problemu
[2022-08-05T17:04:38] rosheee: But u n33d bigger surface
[2022-08-05T17:04:48] Thierry: I set 2kW and 80A max
[2022-08-05T17:05:04] rosheee: 80A phase?
[2022-08-05T17:05:08] rosheee: Or battery amp
[2022-08-05T17:05:16] rosheee: And max current?
[2022-08-05T17:05:34] Thierry: I need first to understand how vesc tool works 😅
[2022-08-05T17:05:43] Thierry: Battery 30A
[2022-08-05T17:05:45] rosheee: Pretty easy
[2022-08-05T17:06:14] rosheee: Cuz the heat from mosfet through idk what pads u used Then to alu Then alu again to alu 2 many surfaces
[2022-08-05T17:19:50] Gigolo Joe: 75100 can do 200 phase too lol
[2022-08-05T17:26:29] Ofek 🐥: @artBula The regular 75100
[2022-08-05T17:36:02] Mirono escooters: How
[2022-08-05T17:39:17] Кирилл: looks like voltage breakdown
[2022-08-05T18:34:02] sombre_enfant: You added solder ?
[2022-08-05T18:34:57] sombre_enfant: How did you put caps backward ?
[2022-08-05T18:43:10] rosheee: U put then on kapton tape?
[2022-08-05T18:43:51] rosheee: The fets
[2022-08-05T18:45:18] rosheee: Not thermalpads?
[2022-08-05T19:27:23] Gigolo Joe: Resolder them...?
[2022-08-05T19:33:25] Ofek 🐥: With thermal paste. It's better than cheapo thermal pad I had. Waiting for "proper" one
[2022-08-05T19:34:13] Ofek 🐥: Desoldered , removed, and soldered on the outer side. Pay attention to polarity
[2022-08-05T19:58:13] rosheee: But u remove when use pads then
[2022-08-05T19:58:14] rosheee: The tape
[2022-08-05T20:03:43] Ofek 🐥: Yeah sure, not gonna isolate them FET's
[2022-08-05T20:12:37] rosheee: 😆good
[2022-08-05T21:16:26] Artem Bulashev: With my 650w VSETT 9+ and ubox75200 dual, ubox was never above 45c as well
[2022-08-05T21:16:44] Artem Bulashev: With 30a battery and 90a phase
[2022-08-05T21:16:59] Artem Bulashev: Without any modes, just thrown into deck
[2022-08-05T21:17:51] Artem Bulashev: Not even crewed to it
[2022-08-05T21:18:37] Artem Bulashev: So conclusion is flipsky simply needed better fets and it would not over heat
[2022-08-05T21:19:19] rosheee: O.o
[2022-08-05T21:19:26] Artem Bulashev: This custom mount will be more than enough for those settings, should offset fets being worse
[2022-08-05T21:19:48] rosheee: What ambient?
[2022-08-05T21:20:53] Artem Bulashev: Inside closed deck
[2022-08-05T21:21:12] Artem Bulashev: 25c outside
[2022-08-05T21:21:31] Artem Bulashev: Motor did over heat
[2022-08-05T21:21:47] Artem Bulashev: Got to 85c
[2022-08-05T21:22:05] Artem Bulashev: But sensor on windings so that was actually set too low
[2022-08-05T21:22:39] Artem Bulashev: Point is, vesc in this case is not the limiting factor - motor is
[2022-08-05T21:25:33] Artem Bulashev: I think ubox dual is ideal for 800w nominal 1500 peak motor, nothing should over heat and will work at close maximum it can handle (120a phase / 40a battery) May be 1000w nominal motor with not too big stator volume. I think at 135a phase and 45a battery Ubox would over heat without mods
[2022-08-05T21:27:33] Jan: Rion Tronic 250: "the TDP is dynamic and dependent on the motor current. The factors are the MOSFET Rds(on) resistance and the motor current at that time. The heat given off by each mosfet are (I^2)*R losses. Rds(on) for these MOSFETs is 2.1mOhm. So for example, heat dissipated for each mosfet at 150A motor current is 150*150*0.0021 = 47.25W. This means that 283.5W total is being dissipated when accounting for all 6 mosfets. However, the average motor current is much less when looking at these logs."
[2022-08-05T21:28:06] Jan: (90A logs)
[2022-08-05T21:28:27] Jan: There is a nice cooling solution for this kind of tdp 😏
[2022-08-05T21:29:07] Mirono escooters: 283w, wow
[2022-08-05T21:33:12] rosheee: We still dont know what temps they have
[2022-08-05T21:33:13] rosheee: But
[2022-08-05T21:33:25] rosheee: <photos/photo_5552@05-08-2022_21-33-25.jpg>
[2022-08-05T21:33:25] rosheee: <photos/photo_5553@05-08-2022_21-33-25.jpg>
[2022-08-05T21:33:41] Artem Bulashev: That’s is not accurate
[2022-08-05T21:34:05] Artem Bulashev: You do not have full phase current on more than 1 mosfet at any point in time
[2022-08-05T21:34:09] rosheee: I had 60-85 degrees with their cases with direct airflow
[2022-08-05T21:34:21] Artem Bulashev: Most of the time max page is shared by 2 fets
[2022-08-05T21:34:27] Artem Bulashev: 3rd is inactive
[2022-08-05T21:34:33] rosheee: And the other 3?
[2022-08-05T21:34:38] Artem Bulashev: Never all 3 fets work
[2022-08-05T21:34:42] rosheee: 6 fets
[2022-08-05T21:34:47] rosheee: Per esc
[2022-08-05T21:34:52] Artem Bulashev: They work in pares
[2022-08-05T21:34:55] Artem Bulashev: Pairs
[2022-08-05T21:34:59] Artem Bulashev: 2 per phase
[2022-08-05T21:35:02] Artem Bulashev: Sharing load
[2022-08-05T21:35:09] rosheee: Cuz sharing is caring
[2022-08-05T21:35:39] Artem Bulashev: If I each would produce 150a phase motor would get 300a per phase wire * 3 according to his logic
[2022-08-05T21:36:10] Artem Bulashev: Also applying phase amp to all 3 phases is basically hand brake
[2022-08-05T21:36:29] Jan: So you know what i have in mind already?
[2022-08-05T21:36:38] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2022-08-05T21:38:00] Artem Bulashev: FOC drives motor forword by switching between a phases, in modulating a wave by switching frequency of open / closed mosfet if I’m not mistaken
[2022-08-05T21:38:34] Artem Bulashev: It creates a vectorial magnetic field
[2022-08-05T21:38:55] Artem Bulashev: That is than attracted to approaching magnet
[2022-08-05T21:39:03] Artem Bulashev: If I understand it correctly
[2022-08-05T21:40:04] Artem Bulashev: so 150a would be shared between two phases in needed proportion to creat correct electromagnetic field to move in intended direction
[2022-08-05T21:40:07] Jan: I meant more like <300W tdp can be heatpiped at 80mm controller width
[2022-08-05T21:40:11] Jan: 😂
[2022-08-05T21:40:53] Jan: It can be disributed over a large heatsink without any watercooling loop
[2022-08-05T21:41:15] Jan: With very limited space
[2022-08-05T21:41:42] Artem Bulashev: 150*150*0.0021=47w of power in heat
[2022-08-05T21:41:51] Jan: x6
[2022-08-05T21:42:01] Artem Bulashev: No man
[2022-08-05T21:42:09] Artem Bulashev: They do not get 150a each
[2022-08-05T21:42:15] Artem Bulashev: They get a proportion of that
[2022-08-05T21:42:52] Jan: The heatpipe i need has a max transfer rate at 60w (180x8x3mm)
[2022-08-05T21:42:56] Artem Bulashev: And not 6, but 4
[2022-08-05T21:43:00] Artem Bulashev: Never 6
[2022-08-05T21:43:05] Artem Bulashev: That would = locked motor
[2022-08-05T21:43:26] Jan: Doesnt matter for me as long its below 600w
[2022-08-05T21:43:31] Mirono escooters: So 12 mos better bcs heat spread or less heat? More mos more efficient?
[2022-08-05T21:44:20] Artem Bulashev: It does matter to other people because you are not asking you are stating and people that read will also than think that this is how it is calculated :)
[2022-08-05T21:44:23] Jan: If its in the right order of magnitude, its fine for the heatsink
[2022-08-05T21:44:55] Artem Bulashev: 12 is better because each individual get will get twice less amps going though it if setting is same 150a
[2022-08-05T21:45:02] Jan: Rion is stating
[2022-08-05T21:45:17] Artem Bulashev: Also larger heat spread surface by factor of 2
[2022-08-05T21:45:22] Jan: I needed a direction to improve on my heatsink
[2022-08-05T21:45:33] Artem Bulashev: And likely larger heat mass of the controller body being larger
[2022-08-05T21:45:41] Mirono escooters: Less heat or spread
[2022-08-05T21:45:52] Jan: You dont need that much thermal mass
[2022-08-05T21:46:00] Jan: It just has to go out of the system
[2022-08-05T21:46:13] Jan: Its dampening spikes for sure
[2022-08-05T21:46:24] Artem Bulashev: Same amount of heat is produced from 150a = 47w heat
[2022-08-05T21:46:25] Jan: So not too low, but 3mm alu plate is good
[2022-08-05T21:46:44] Artem Bulashev: Actually May be less
[2022-08-05T21:46:46] Artem Bulashev: Because
[2022-08-05T21:46:48] Jan: Yes
[2022-08-05T21:46:58] Artem Bulashev: IR of 12 fets system is lower
[2022-08-05T21:47:01] Artem Bulashev: Like in batteries
[2022-08-05T21:47:05] Mirono escooters: Oh yes
[2022-08-05T21:47:08] Mirono escooters: So efficienter
[2022-08-05T21:47:11] Artem Bulashev: 1 cell IR vs 10p IR
[2022-08-05T21:47:26] Artem Bulashev: I suspect it would work similar way
[2022-08-05T21:47:35] Jan: Still, current design at 16kW for 1minute heated from 45°C to 55°C at 30°C ambient
[2022-08-05T21:48:10] Artem Bulashev: 2 FET per phase vs 4 fets per phase is massive difference
[2022-08-05T21:49:19] Artem Bulashev: Or May be not not sure if System IR for fets works like in batteries
[2022-08-05T21:49:58] Mirono escooters: Id bet so
[2022-08-05T21:50:57] Jan: Im no electrical engineer, my knowledge ends with semi-advanced electronics 🤷‍♂️
[2022-08-05T21:51:19] Jan: I leave that to people who knows this
[2022-08-05T21:51:20] Artem Bulashev: Nor am I
[2022-08-05T21:51:36] Artem Bulashev: But phases arr for sure never open all 3
[2022-08-05T21:51:46] Mirono escooters: Imma be one, but not now😀
[2022-08-05T21:51:47] Jan: I did not spend enough time on this topic
[2022-08-05T21:52:01] Artem Bulashev: And current is shared between active fets and not applied to each FET - that would be madness
[2022-08-05T21:52:24] Jan: Me is only design, mechanical engineering, thermodynamics, additive manufacturing
[2022-08-05T21:52:40] Artem Bulashev: I did due to custom drone building and even co designed a couple of engines, my job was not electrical but I learned a lot from manufacturer about dc brushless motors designing aspects
[2022-08-05T21:52:41] Jan: Rest is basic/ semi advanced
[2022-08-05T21:58:13] Paolo ⁭: 6 mos can’t be closed contemporary
[2022-08-05T21:59:00] Jan: With that heatsink now, nobody can tell me that the total heat is less than 50W tdp
[2022-08-05T21:59:36] Jan: <photos/photo_5554@05-08-2022_21-59-36.jpg>
[2022-08-05T21:59:45] Paolo ⁭: If you have 200A continuos as dc your mosfet and motor cable will melt in less than 5 seconds
[2022-08-05T22:00:24] Jan: 20s6p
[2022-08-05T22:00:41] Jan: 12-14kW for the stated time period in the graph
[2022-08-05T22:01:01] Jan: From 100s to 180s
[2022-08-05T22:01:41] Jan: It has to be about 200A battery for quite some time
[2022-08-05T22:02:13] Jan: I cannot believe its 50W or less tdp per controller
[2022-08-05T22:02:28] Jan: That would cool to ambient in seconds at 80+kmh
[2022-08-05T22:02:55] Jan: The radiator is 400x120mm
[2022-08-05T22:03:01] Paolo ⁭: Yes but in the motor wire the phase don’t get 200A continuously, because the motor is 3 phase, so 2 phase works and one off , and the esc switch very fast .
[2022-08-05T22:03:01] Jan: 7mm fins
[2022-08-05T22:03:09] Jan: Yes
[2022-08-05T22:03:45] Paolo ⁭: Tdp is the current dissipated by 4 mosfet
[2022-08-05T22:03:52] Paolo ⁭: In 3 phase esc
[2022-08-05T22:04:02] Jan: Can be, agree
[2022-08-05T22:04:04] Paolo ⁭: Only 4 mos work together
[2022-08-05T22:04:40] Jan: But still even then must be 200w each controller at 150A
[2022-08-05T22:04:40] Paolo ⁭: But they are switched very fast
[2022-08-05T22:04:58] Paolo ⁭: So you get the heat as 6 mos
[2022-08-05T22:05:17] Jan: Im not trying to make a point, im trying to make the best heatsink 😅
[2022-08-05T22:05:19] Paolo ⁭: But even produced heat is less than mos with continuos current
[2022-08-05T22:05:42] Jan: Ok
[2022-08-05T22:06:13] Paolo ⁭: Need nitrogen 😂
[2022-08-05T22:06:15] Artem Bulashev: Heat sink can vary heat away
[2022-08-05T22:06:39] Jan: Will try the pipe version anyway now. The non pipe is already enough for me but @roscheeee might need a race track ready version
[2022-08-05T22:06:40] Artem Bulashev: But fets peak and heat up fast if IR is high
[2022-08-05T22:07:02] Artem Bulashev: Best fets have IR at around 1.3mOhm for 75v version
[2022-08-05T22:07:12] Jan: Ok
[2022-08-05T22:07:36] Artem Bulashev: Best 100v fets are used in Vesc 100v ubox dual
[2022-08-05T22:07:36] Jan: 2.1mOhm for rion
[2022-08-05T22:07:49] Artem Bulashev: And those are 2.1 as well i think
[2022-08-05T22:07:56] Jan: Will do the vsett 10+ with ubox
[2022-08-05T22:08:14] Paolo ⁭: The Chinese mosfet that spintend use is 1.3mOhm and 100v
[2022-08-05T22:08:20] Artem Bulashev: It’s abit under powered for vsett10+ motors
[2022-08-05T22:08:22] Jan: Spacer design for it will be hard
[2022-08-05T22:08:25] Mirono escooters: Hmmmm
[2022-08-05T22:08:32] Artem Bulashev: But with good cooling solution it will do well
[2022-08-05T22:08:33] Paolo ⁭: I think isn’t much reliable xd
[2022-08-05T22:08:35] Jan: I liked your 9+ spacer that it wasnt visible
[2022-08-05T22:08:49] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5555@05-08-2022_22-08-49.jpg>
[2022-08-05T22:09:01] Artem Bulashev: Yeah 5mm and rubber still in place
[2022-08-05T22:09:05] Jan: <animation>
[2022-08-05T22:09:19] Artem Bulashev: Rubber removed will be invisible, May be 0.5mm visible
[2022-08-05T22:09:59] Artem Bulashev: For 10+ you are best to find old USB C red Ubox
[2022-08-05T22:10:05] Artem Bulashev: It had best fets
[2022-08-05T22:10:17] Artem Bulashev: For 16s
[2022-08-05T22:10:17] Jan: Ok
[2022-08-05T22:10:31] Jan: Not sure what to do with the 10+
[2022-08-05T22:10:50] Jan: The steering geometry is not the most stable
[2022-08-05T22:10:56] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-08-05T22:11:01] Jan: Maybe an endurance offroad
[2022-08-05T22:11:11] Artem Bulashev: Needs to be 3cm in front of the stem axle
[2022-08-05T22:11:21] Jan: Doesnt need much power (4kW is enough) but lots of range
[2022-08-05T22:12:09] Jan: Maybe i print a longer ones for the front lol
[2022-08-05T22:12:10] Artem Bulashev: That is why Ninebot with after market front suspension is extremely stable - front axis is about 3cm in front of stem axle planer intersection
[2022-08-05T22:12:14] Paolo ⁭: Fets is the same on the red version and purple one
[2022-08-05T22:12:34] Artem Bulashev: On new red or old red?
[2022-08-05T22:12:42] Artem Bulashev: Old red had different fets
[2022-08-05T22:12:55] Artem Bulashev: The version with 12 screws on top
[2022-08-05T22:13:11] Paolo ⁭: Old red
[2022-08-05T22:13:13] Artem Bulashev: Spintend told me that 🫣
[2022-08-05T22:13:15] Artem Bulashev: Odd
[2022-08-05T22:13:24] Paolo ⁭: Share same fet as purple version
[2022-08-05T22:13:30] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2022-08-05T22:13:35] Paolo ⁭: At least if they no scammed me
[2022-08-05T22:13:45] Artem Bulashev: Hmm
[2022-08-05T22:13:50] Artem Bulashev: Will try to find old photo
[2022-08-05T22:13:54] Paolo ⁭: Because when I bought the purple version they says on website the same fet model as the old
[2022-08-05T22:14:00] Paolo ⁭: With FDBL fets
[2022-08-05T22:14:14] Paolo ⁭: With 1.1-1.3mOhm
[2022-08-05T22:15:09] Paolo ⁭: The only thing I can tell you is the old red version has worse temp sensor setup, so the temp increase of temp sensor is lot slower than purple one
[2022-08-05T22:15:50] Artem Bulashev: “The Ubox 75v with original mosfet FDBL0150N80 is most powerful”
[2022-08-05T22:16:02] Paolo ⁭: Yes, is the same on purple version
[2022-08-05T22:16:12] rosheee: Thermalpaste arrived
[2022-08-05T22:16:46] Artem Bulashev: Fuck need a bit for vsett too
[2022-08-05T22:16:49] rosheee: <photos/photo_5556@05-08-2022_22-16-49.jpg>
[2022-08-05T22:16:50] Artem Bulashev: Which one you got ?
[2022-08-05T22:16:53] Artem Bulashev: Nice
[2022-08-05T22:17:01] rosheee: We will see
[2022-08-05T22:17:10] Artem Bulashev: It’s is excellent
[2022-08-05T22:17:12] rosheee: Need 1 for whole bottom
[2022-08-05T22:17:18] rosheee: Yah found nothing better
[2022-08-05T22:17:18] Jan: <photos/photo_5557@05-08-2022_22-17-18.jpg>
[2022-08-05T22:17:24] Jan: 3.76g/cm3
[2022-08-05T22:17:36] Artem Bulashev: Remember seeing it on many reviews being at the top
[2022-08-05T22:17:41] Jan: I mean pure aluminium is 2.7
[2022-08-05T22:17:47] rosheee: Yah i hope for 90 bucks
[2022-08-05T22:18:22] Jan: Beryllium oxide paste would be best, but toxic
[2022-08-05T22:18:59] rosheee: If we use copper on copper i have 10g
[2022-08-05T22:19:07] rosheee: Here it looks big
[2022-08-05T22:19:53] rosheee: <photos/photo_5559@05-08-2022_22-19-53.jpg>
[2022-08-05T22:19:56] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2022-08-05T22:20:02] rosheee: 😂😂🙈🙈🙈
[2022-08-05T22:20:03] Artem Bulashev: But you need tiny bit
[2022-08-05T22:20:17] rosheee: XD for 30cm x 15cm?
[2022-08-05T22:20:31] rosheee: Or even more
[2022-08-05T22:24:30] Artem Bulashev: There are cheaper options with about same performance
[2022-08-05T22:28:57] Artem Bulashev: Grizzly Liquid metal 73 w/mk vs your grizzly paste 12.5 w/mk 😁😁😁
[2022-08-05T22:29:29] Paolo ⁭: Metal liquid can’t be used with fets
[2022-08-05T22:29:41] Paolo ⁭: The paste should be no conductive
[2022-08-05T22:32:58] Artem Bulashev: If you have heatsink in between than sure
[2022-08-05T22:33:32] Artem Bulashev: Like so
[2022-08-05T22:33:43] rosheee: Use that in pc
[2022-08-05T22:33:50] rosheee: Liquid metal vs aluminium
[2022-08-05T22:34:12] rosheee: RIP aluminium
[2022-08-05T22:34:41] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5561@05-08-2022_22-34-41.jpg>
[2022-08-05T22:35:01] Artem Bulashev: Stock also had chunk of aluminum to spread heat
[2022-08-05T22:35:07] Mirono escooters: Yea most do
[2022-08-05T22:35:10] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-08-05T22:35:25] Artem Bulashev: So what’s the conclusion
[2022-08-05T22:35:36] rosheee: Coollab liquid metal try it ^^
[2022-08-05T22:35:39] rosheee: On aluminium
[2022-08-05T22:36:19] rosheee: Btw the one i use has 14 w/mK
[2022-08-05T22:36:24] rosheee: Not 12 like normal
[2022-08-05T22:36:43] Artem Bulashev: Cap tape + best thermal plaste Or best thinnest heat pad from fets to deck directly Or best thtinest pad + copper + pad again to the deck
[2022-08-05T22:37:09] rosheee: 0.5mm alphacool 17 w/mK
[2022-08-05T22:38:48] rosheee: Direct to frame or heatsink
[2022-08-05T22:41:52] Artem Bulashev: The best thermal pads are Fujipoly Ultra Extreme SARCON XR-m(17.0W/m-K). But they cost a pretty penny. EDIT: I just now realized that those Alphacool Eisschicht pads are rebranded SARCON XR-m. So get those if they're cheaper. Or if that's all that's available.
[2022-08-05T22:42:20] Artem Bulashev: Fujipoly is cheaper than the Alphacool
[2022-08-05T22:42:34] Paolo ⁭: All these are useless
[2022-08-05T22:42:45] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2022-08-05T22:42:55] Paolo ⁭: The real problem of cooling of smd mos isn’t thermal pad type
[2022-08-05T22:42:56] Artem Bulashev: What do you propose we use ?
[2022-08-05T22:43:08] rosheee: Link
[2022-08-05T22:43:10] Paolo ⁭: But the contact surface
[2022-08-05T22:43:21] Paolo ⁭: You’re touching the resin tha hasn’t heat conductivity
[2022-08-05T22:43:55] Artem Bulashev: But the faster you transfer heat to heat sink the better for sure. Would be nice if fets had larger heat dissipating area
[2022-08-05T22:44:05] Artem Bulashev: Oh you mean on ubox
[2022-08-05T22:44:08] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-08-05T22:44:49] Artem Bulashev: That is why filling with thermally conductive compound works so well on Ubox (a lot of heat goes back to PCB due to design) - pcb now is able to dissipate heat to aluminum as well, not only air
[2022-08-05T22:45:53] Artem Bulashev: That pad on new 75100 alum pcb ❤️❤️❤️
[2022-08-05T22:46:22] Paolo ⁭: Spintend or flipsky lol
[2022-08-05T22:46:28] Paolo ⁭: All same name
[2022-08-05T22:46:32] Paolo ⁭: Lot confusion
[2022-08-05T22:47:00] Mirono escooters: Wich
[2022-08-05T22:47:06] Mirono escooters: We got pics of 75100?
[2022-08-05T22:47:09] Mirono escooters: The alu pcb
[2022-08-05T22:47:41] rosheee: Btw i used the 17 wmK on ubox v1 xD
[2022-08-05T22:48:09] rosheee: Here and inside xD
[2022-08-05T22:48:23] Luis Magalhaes: cheap for the problems 🙈
[2022-08-05T22:48:30] Jan: Beryllium oxide is non conductive 300W/mK
[2022-08-05T22:48:58] Jan: Inhale it once and you die
[2022-08-05T22:49:11] Mirono escooters: You get everything at this point
[2022-08-05T22:49:48] Mirono escooters: Oempf. Is it a liquid? Giving off damps?
[2022-08-05T22:49:52] Paolo ⁭: My ubox was already on fire when app says 32° xd
[2022-08-05T22:50:03] Artem Bulashev: Grapheme thermal pad 62 w/mk, electrically conductive though,
[2022-08-05T22:50:13] rosheee: Yep conductive
[2022-08-05T22:50:16] rosheee: And to small
[2022-08-05T22:50:37] rosheee: Got them here as well ^^'
[2022-08-05T22:50:46] Artem Bulashev: But should work well for ubox style fets mount
[2022-08-05T22:50:58] rosheee: Good luck when u cut it
[2022-08-05T22:51:08] Artem Bulashev: Damm
[2022-08-05T22:51:14] Artem Bulashev: Dammmm
[2022-08-05T22:51:50] rosheee: After i used 11 m/wK alphacool pads on ubox i instantly wrote spintend to send me theirs cuz they worked much better
[2022-08-05T22:54:09] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5564@05-08-2022_22-54-09.jpg>
[2022-08-05T22:54:24] Artem Bulashev: Whaaat??
[2022-08-05T22:54:30] Artem Bulashev: 😄😄😄
[2022-08-05T22:54:59] Artem Bulashev: May be you didn’t apply new once correctly or they where too thin or you touched fets with oily fingers 😁
[2022-08-05T22:55:11] Artem Bulashev: What pads they use ?? 😄😄
[2022-08-05T22:57:12] Artem Bulashev: I requested more info on their pads
[2022-08-05T23:04:09] rosheee: Idk
[2022-08-05T23:04:14] rosheee: Nah xD always proper
[2022-08-05T23:04:59] rosheee: @SibClimb is julien from fastride?
[2022-08-05T23:05:49] Paolo ⁭: Brother
[2022-08-05T23:06:39] Face de Pin Sucé: Nonononono
[2022-08-05T23:07:51] Mirono escooters: Beryllium oxide, also known as beryllia, is an inorganic compound with the formula BeO. This colourless solid is a notable electrical insulator with a higher thermal conductivity than any other non-metal except diamond, and exceeds that of most metals. As an amorphous solid, beryllium oxide is white.
[2022-08-05T23:07:53] Mirono escooters: Ö
[2022-08-05T23:08:06] Mirono escooters: Get some diamonds roschee
[2022-08-05T23:10:44] rosheee: Nah
[2022-08-05T23:10:48] rosheee: Silver first
[2022-08-05T23:11:03] rosheee: Asked friend if he can melt and make case
[2022-08-05T23:11:25] rosheee: Got steerling silver cpu cooler but pff ...
[2022-08-05T23:11:29] Mirono escooters: Silver owo
[2022-08-05T23:12:00] rosheee: Difference to copper model is 2-3 degrees over 24h on 5ghz 16 core cpu
[2022-08-05T23:12:08] rosheee: 100%load
[2022-08-05T23:12:18] Paolo ⁭: Maybe Suce using ferrofluid as thermal paste
[2022-08-05T23:12:32] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2022-08-05T23:12:58] rosheee: Told ya kidnap xD
[2022-08-05T23:13:29] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_5565@05-08-2022_23-13-29.jpg>
[2022-08-05T23:17:10] rosheee: Oh shit
[2022-08-05T23:48:40] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5566@05-08-2022_23-48-40.jpg>
[2022-08-05T23:48:52] Artem Bulashev: Man it takes long time to charge 30ah battery 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2022-08-05T23:49:06] Artem Bulashev: I’m at 6amps charging, feels like for ever lol
[2022-08-05T23:49:10] rosheee: XD lol
[2022-08-05T23:49:30] rosheee: i use 8A on 25.2Ah
[2022-08-05T23:49:35] rosheee: feels like 1.5h
[2022-08-05T23:50:42] Artem Bulashev: Btw
[2022-08-05T23:50:45] Artem Bulashev: Do you know why
[2022-08-05T23:50:51] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5567@05-08-2022_23-50-51.jpg>
[2022-08-05T23:50:56] Artem Bulashev: I see no settings
[2022-08-05T23:51:31] Artem Bulashev: Have to use not original app to do settings changes, but I feel like I should at least normally see configuration parameters
[2022-08-05T23:51:49] rosheee: ant?
[2022-08-05T23:51:56] Artem Bulashev: Llt
[2022-08-05T23:52:04] rosheee: btw @artBula u may know this what settings to use balancing on dalya?
[2022-08-05T23:52:05] rosheee: daly
[2022-08-05T23:52:35] Artem Bulashev: Let’s go to battery chat
[2022-08-05T23:52:38] Artem Bulashev: Not to spam
[2022-08-05T23:52:51] Mirono escooters: Step 1: dont use daly
[2022-08-05T23:54:00] rosheee: why xD
[2022-08-05T23:54:03] rosheee: where?
[2022-08-05T23:55:00] Artem Bulashev: https://t.me/+LrFQbscqlDI3NzQ0
[2022-08-05T23:55:18] Artem Bulashev: Agree
[2022-08-06T03:01:09] rosheee: OH SHIT
[2022-08-06T03:01:13] rosheee: fastride made it LOL
[2022-08-06T13:01:00] rosheee: No xD but they said they have it
[2022-08-06T13:01:06] rosheee: And send it
[2022-08-06T13:01:12] rosheee: Npw they made 3 ips packs
[2022-08-06T13:01:13] rosheee: Ups
[2022-08-06T15:41:52] rosheee: Testing SKF 2RSL/C3
[2022-08-06T23:01:26] David: How come i see this video now... Have you tried already to get what range you getting with my pack??
[2022-08-07T01:20:07] rosheee: What paq?
[2022-08-07T05:37:34] Ofek 🐥: Haven't done range test.. But It's a lot 😂
[2022-08-07T06:32:16] David: 😂
[2022-08-07T07:24:52] rosheee: WHAT IS IT XD?
[2022-08-07T07:25:45] Ofek 🐥: Battery pack, 72/28
[2022-08-07T07:42:57] rosheee: 72v 28Ah
[2022-08-07T07:43:04] rosheee: In whut scooterinhio?
[2022-08-07T07:48:27] Ofek 🐥: inokim ox
[2022-08-07T12:46:07] Izuna 生活: Lol, my Flipsky 75100 not booting up anymore 🤨 No motor sound check on start (this very high pitch sound you know), no dashboard update, no bluetooth connection 😬 how tf can I figure that out lol
[2022-08-07T12:47:58] Izuna 生活: Came back from my ride yesterday, put it on charger, tried turning it on and not booting anymore 😅
[2022-08-07T12:52:52] Mirono escooters: F
[2022-08-07T12:52:58] Mirono escooters: Bart ok?
[2022-08-07T12:53:04] Mirono escooters: Thats first thing to check
[2022-08-07T13:09:01] Ofek 🐥: Does the LED light up? 🤔
[2022-08-07T13:09:48] TᑌᖇᗷOᔕᗩᔕᑕᕼ: I still have one for sale 😁
[2022-08-07T13:11:16] Izuna 生活: It did turn on, yes, but came back after picking up tools and since then LED dead as well.
[2022-08-07T13:11:23] Izuna 生活: Battery is ok, power is there.
[2022-08-07T13:20:23] Ofek 🐥: can connect to the STM with ST-LINK?
[2022-08-07T13:21:24] sombre_enfant: 30€?
[2022-08-07T13:25:49] TᑌᖇᗷOᔕᗩᔕᑕᕼ: 1,99 Euro 😅
[2022-08-07T13:55:30] sombre_enfant: Bet
[2022-08-07T19:54:36] Izuna 生活: I am thinking about ordering the new Spintend Single Ubox 100V 100A ESC as replacement for my Flipsky 75100 and to power it with 22S. Do I need the bluetooth modul if I have one from Flipsky, nah right, just have to swap the connector (what type of connectors is spintend using)? And is known which MOSFETs it is using? Also it is based on VESC 100V250A, so when I compile VESC 6.0 firmware for VESC 100V250A it should just work or does it have any difference?
[2022-08-07T19:56:37] Izuna 生活: Wish they would have a wiring diagram of the connectors on the ESC, to check if I need to rewire everything... like Flipsky does.
[2022-08-07T19:58:10] Ofek 🐥: Couldn't get the flipsky to run? What did you tried?
[2022-08-07T19:59:25] Ofek 🐥: Checked 5v? 3.3v? Write firmware with stlink?
[2022-08-07T20:00:39] Izuna 生活: For now only trying to check if I see anything on the PCB and to connect with another battery, but seems some component on there is fucked up. I am on vacation, so no tools besides soldering equipment (yes I take soldering shit with me), but will be back tomorrow. I have another Flipsky 75100 as well.
[2022-08-07T20:00:48] TᑌᖇᗷOᔕᗩᔕᑕᕼ: The 100v ubox is not available at the moment!
[2022-08-07T20:01:00] Izuna 生活: Yes I know, the release was scheduled.
[2022-08-07T20:01:07] Izuna 生活: But for the future you know, need more power.
[2022-08-07T20:01:17] Izuna 生活: and more reliable.
[2022-08-07T20:01:36] Mirono escooters: Wonder if it will hzve more powa
[2022-08-07T20:01:51] Ofek 🐥: I always have stlink and uart-usb adapters with me 😂
[2022-08-07T20:01:56] Mirono escooters: Bluetooth module intercompativl
[2022-08-07T20:02:34] Izuna 生活: I have UART-USB inside my scooter to always connect to my battery in case BotoxBMS fails again 😂 (well and because I made a small app to have live data)
[2022-08-07T20:02:40] Izuna 生活: But no ST-Link
[2022-08-07T20:03:36] Izuna 生活: Hopefully, who knows. Flipsky 75100 can handle a lot with upgraded MOSFETs, but don't know if it can handle up to 22S.
[2022-08-07T20:04:34] Mirono escooters: Eh risky
[2022-08-07T20:04:45] Mirono escooters: W no ebrake..
[2022-08-07T20:05:10] Izuna 生活: Did someone already try if 75100 can handle 22S? Risky and for sure no headroom with for ebrake, but components should be able to handle it.
[2022-08-07T20:05:30] Izuna 生活: yeah, but I have it disabled all the time anyway 😬
[2022-08-07T20:05:42] Izuna 生活: I don't need brakes
[2022-08-07T20:13:24] Mirono escooters: Pft who needs brakes
[2022-08-07T20:13:33] Mirono escooters: You dont need to stop only accel
[2022-08-07T20:20:38] Izuna 生活: ya right, most efficient.
[2022-08-07T20:29:18] Izuna 生活: I have killed the Flipsky 75100 exactly 5 times now: 1. PCB nuked (maybe Phase Filtering was active) 2. Accidentally drilled through MOSFETs and turned it on 3. BMS cut-out at 55.5V - killed MOSFETs 4. BMS cut-out at 72V - killed MOSFETs 5. No idea. Not booting.
[2022-08-07T20:41:26] Mirono escooters: Drilled through?? 🥲😂
[2022-08-07T20:41:36] Mirono escooters: So 2 times not their fault 3 times most likely
[2022-08-07T20:41:40] Mirono escooters: The bms cut out sucks
[2022-08-07T23:54:51] Artem Bulashev: Single Ubox 100v will be released soon
[2022-08-07T23:54:54] Artem Bulashev: I’m sorry
[2022-08-07T23:55:02] Artem Bulashev: It is my fault it is delayed
[2022-08-07T23:55:11] Artem Bulashev: But I made you a big favor
[2022-08-07T23:55:18] Izuna 生活: Yes I know, they had brass heatsink
[2022-08-07T23:55:25] Izuna 生活: but now changed to copper
[2022-08-07T23:55:37] Artem Bulashev: They were about to release very poorly designed heat transferring
[2022-08-07T23:55:47] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2022-08-07T23:56:10] Mirono escooters: Smort ppl
[2022-08-07T23:56:11] Artem Bulashev: That was expensive mistake
[2022-08-07T23:56:27] Mirono escooters: Sry but i dont trust any of the design after they just decided brass would work
[2022-08-07T23:56:37] Artem Bulashev: Impossible to know it all :-)
[2022-08-07T23:56:46] Mirono escooters: Yes but thats basic
[2022-08-07T23:56:50] Mirono escooters: And i mean, engineers?
[2022-08-07T23:56:52] Artem Bulashev: Not really
[2022-08-07T23:56:53] Mirono escooters: No post check?
[2022-08-07T23:57:07] Mirono escooters: Let someone read it? Like science? 😋
[2022-08-07T23:57:08] Artem Bulashev: Do you know what is more conductive titanium or aluminum?
[2022-08-07T23:57:14] Mirono escooters: Alu
[2022-08-07T23:57:20] Artem Bulashev: Thermally
[2022-08-07T23:57:30] Mirono escooters: And still, dont need to know from head, a quick google jas it
[2022-08-07T23:57:44] Mirono escooters: Oh hell i even have my old science book that had those things in it xd
[2022-08-07T23:58:22] Artem Bulashev: Spintend is small company, with only few people
[2022-08-07T23:58:23] Mirono escooters: Anyway ppl buy what they like and how they see it, i just find it strange decision🙈
[2022-08-07T23:58:40] Mirono escooters: Eh, maybe shit happens, but still.. 😋
[2022-08-07T23:58:48] Artem Bulashev: Brass has copper lever of thermal mass btw
[2022-08-07T23:59:04] Mirono escooters: Yes but conducts like shite so🙃
[2022-08-07T23:59:14] Artem Bulashev: Which means it would dampen and take as much heat
[2022-08-07T23:59:26] Artem Bulashev: Yeah but it is poor with than passing it along
[2022-08-07T23:59:33] Artem Bulashev: To the air / deck
[2022-08-07T23:59:43] Mirono escooters: Well pass it on as a small mistake, wich got fixed😋
[2022-08-07T23:59:56] Artem Bulashev: But with copper now it will be niiiice
[2022-08-07T23:59:58] Mirono escooters: Better then flipsky dying when accel batt cuts out, i guess.😖
[2022-08-08T00:00:03] Mirono escooters: Agree
[2022-08-08T00:00:07] Artem Bulashev: Likely best in size vs performance
[2022-08-08T00:00:13] Artem Bulashev: For 100v
[2022-08-08T00:00:50] Artem Bulashev: Also I believe in future we will see aluminum pcb ubox 😊
[2022-08-08T00:02:02] Mirono escooters: I hope so
[2022-08-08T00:02:05] Mirono escooters: Thats cool shit
[2022-08-08T00:02:15] Mirono escooters: I still wanna see insides of the alu flipsky
[2022-08-08T00:02:22] Artem Bulashev: I got them very interested some time ago with such solution that would allow Ubox to do 170a phase and 70a battery continues without any extra cooling solutions I expect - specially if they make NAKED CNC aluminum case for it
[2022-08-08T00:02:36] Artem Bulashev: It has been posted and there is video on YouTube
[2022-08-08T00:02:41] Mirono escooters: I cant wait till the opensourcr 12 mos vesc is here. I wanna build some, make custom shite, i cant wait to let my engineering brain go woosh
[2022-08-08T00:02:53] Mirono escooters: Oh
[2022-08-08T00:03:32] Jan: Getting the 2x new version of the LittleFocer next week. Lets see how they perform against Rion Tronic 250. (Ninebot G30 20s6p)
[2022-08-08T00:04:17] Artem Bulashev: Isn’t it same controller as Rion ?
[2022-08-08T00:06:08] Jan: Yes its the same layout and everything but the companies use different parts on it
[2022-08-08T00:06:13] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2022-08-08T00:06:20] Artem Bulashev: It has awg 12 phase wires
[2022-08-08T00:06:24] Artem Bulashev: 😀😀😀
[2022-08-08T00:07:13] Artem Bulashev: How do they imagine 4mm2 supposed to to 250a phase ??😄😄
[2022-08-08T00:07:25] Artem Bulashev: Wonder what is the battery wire ga
[2022-08-08T00:07:44] Artem Bulashev: It needs to be 7-8ga for 100a battery current
[2022-08-08T00:08:15] Jan: Changed cables everywhere 🤷‍♂️
[2022-08-08T00:08:22] Artem Bulashev: Oh 250 is peak
[2022-08-08T00:09:06] Artem Bulashev: So it is more like 150 continues give or take depending on battery limit set
[2022-08-08T00:09:59] Artem Bulashev: Oh no, looks like battery power is 12awg as well…. Even ubox has 10awg
[2022-08-08T00:10:08] Izuna 生活: *18mos if I remember correctly. If we talk about the same.
[2022-08-08T00:10:54] Mirono escooters: The one from david smartesc
[2022-08-08T00:11:08] Izuna 生活: Yes
[2022-08-08T00:11:09] Artem Bulashev: Little focer is 72 X 82mm which is preaty big
[2022-08-08T00:11:21] Mirono escooters: 18 mos? Even better
[2022-08-08T00:12:01] Artem Bulashev: I would bet that new Flipsky 75100 flat with aluminum pcb can do same amount of phase and battery as focer
[2022-08-08T00:12:09] Artem Bulashev: But size is better I believe
[2022-08-08T00:14:03] Jan: Any smaller 8kW box?
[2022-08-08T00:14:03] Artem Bulashev: I think they likely even use same fets, but one soldered to aluminum pcb vs other put to aluminum heat sink directly - I think end thermal result would be VERY similar
[2022-08-08T00:14:35] Artem Bulashev: Flipsky 75100 aluminum should do same performance
[2022-08-08T00:15:53] Jan: Ill have a look tomorrow
[2022-08-08T00:16:14] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5569@08-08-2022_00-16-14.jpg>
[2022-08-08T00:16:35] Paolo ⁭: 100 continues
[2022-08-08T00:16:48] Paolo ⁭: Phase continuos current = battery current
[2022-08-08T00:17:08] Artem Bulashev: Yeah so same rating as ALL
[2022-08-08T00:17:29] Artem Bulashev: But I have seen alum 75100 do 200pln see and highs battery don’t remember now
[2022-08-08T00:17:39] Paolo ⁭: If u can 150 continuos phase mean u can 150a batt
[2022-08-08T00:17:46] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5570@08-08-2022_00-17-46.jpg>
[2022-08-08T00:17:54] Artem Bulashev: That 200phase and 100a battery
[2022-08-08T00:18:13] Artem Bulashev: Not continuously of course
[2022-08-08T00:18:22] Artem Bulashev: But I think focer will be exactly same
[2022-08-08T00:18:58] Paolo ⁭: When I used 200a phase my old ubox got on fire ahhaha
[2022-08-08T00:19:03] Paolo ⁭: The one with fdbl mos
[2022-08-08T00:19:08] Paolo ⁭: 1.1mohm
[2022-08-08T00:19:51] Artem Bulashev: Ubox is not good with such - cooling solution is poor
[2022-08-08T00:20:08] Artem Bulashev: But focer and alum 75100 have very similar solutions
[2022-08-08T00:20:08] Mirono escooters: Me 200a phase on makerx going well
[2022-08-08T00:20:12] Mirono escooters: Just heat..
[2022-08-08T00:20:16] Mirono escooters: Need heatsink
[2022-08-08T00:20:36] Artem Bulashev: <files/2203031730_HUAYI-HYG015N10NS1TA_C2979263.pdf>
[2022-08-08T00:20:47] Artem Bulashev: This is alum 75100 data sheet
[2022-08-08T00:20:57] Artem Bulashev: Let’s try to find what fet is on focer
[2022-08-08T00:21:08] Paolo ⁭: I don’t know when u talk about 75100 if mean flipsky or spintend
[2022-08-08T00:21:24] Artem Bulashev: Alum 75100
[2022-08-08T00:21:54] Artem Bulashev: Alum pcb is only on new flipsky
[2022-08-08T00:22:20] Paolo ⁭: But you’re spintend partner, so who know if you have preview ahhaha
[2022-08-08T00:23:03] Mirono escooters: 1200a pulsed??💀😂😂
[2022-08-08T00:24:30] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5571@08-08-2022_00-24-30.jpg>
[2022-08-08T00:25:01] Artem Bulashev: Haha no no speaking of flip alum vs focer
[2022-08-08T00:26:00] Artem Bulashev: You know me, im not Flipsky fun by ANY stretch, but that one vesc I think is special on thermals and possible top performance.
[2022-08-08T00:26:17] Paolo ⁭: Almost impossible
[2022-08-08T00:26:20] Artem Bulashev: What fets are in Focer
[2022-08-08T00:26:25] Paolo ⁭: That’s the spec of my spot welder mos
[2022-08-08T00:26:58] Mirono escooters: My old ones too
[2022-08-08T00:27:01] Mirono escooters: Still blew one up
[2022-08-08T00:27:18] Paolo ⁭: Can be optimized more, adding a copper plate on the mosfet resin surface too
[2022-08-08T00:27:26] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_5572@08-08-2022_00-27-26.jpg>
[2022-08-08T00:27:33] Paolo ⁭: 0.5mOhm
[2022-08-08T00:28:00] Paolo ⁭: Paid 5€/mos lol
[2022-08-08T00:28:53] Artem Bulashev: Where you see ?
[2022-08-08T00:29:31] Artem Bulashev: 0.5 mOhm I never saw 😄😄😄
[2022-08-08T00:29:52] Mirono escooters: Howe
[2022-08-08T00:30:17] Paolo ⁭: For 40v maximum
[2022-08-08T00:30:22] Paolo ⁭: For my spot welder
[2022-08-08T00:30:30] Paolo ⁭: 12 mos 0.5mOhm in parallel
[2022-08-08T00:31:06] Paolo ⁭: Pulses more than 5000A
[2022-08-08T00:31:16] Artem Bulashev: Oh for 40v yeah
[2022-08-08T00:31:26] Artem Bulashev: I thought that is the one in focer
[2022-08-08T00:31:35] Paolo ⁭: What is focer?
[2022-08-08T00:31:39] Paolo ⁭: The little focer?
[2022-08-08T00:35:04] Artem Bulashev: Yea
[2022-08-08T13:32:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: believe or know ? 😁
[2022-08-08T15:32:51] Oliver Eliasson: https://www.bikester.se/magura-mt5e-skivbroms-higo-fram-bak-M420038.html
[2022-08-08T15:33:54] Oliver Eliasson: Is there different versions of mt5e? Anyone tried fitting it to vsett 9?
[2022-08-08T17:00:37] sombre_enfant: Its the same nce mos as tronic not much choice in that package
[2022-08-08T17:38:47] Artem Bulashev: Well what I realized is that Spintend can do well electrical design but they don’t have thermal-dynamic design knowledge, which is why we have from them what we have - every vesc they made had unoptimal thermal design.
[2022-08-08T17:39:32] Artem Bulashev: So from now on I’m participating as 3rd set of eyes, like I did with single 100v
[2022-08-08T17:40:59] Artem Bulashev: And they asked me to cooperate with them on EScooter specific vesc design. So I think naked aluminum vesc is comming - it makes sense, as thermal conductivity of un-anodized casing is a lot better, specially if it is polished abit

[2022-08-10T19:34:53] Artem Bulashev: I would separate logic to occupy space above fets, that would allow for 30% smaller foot print and same over all hight. Strange design decisions
[2022-08-10T19:35:34] Paolo ⁭: 82uF xd?
[2022-08-10T19:35:49] Artem Bulashev: Seem like smart people, why they don’t do that is beyond me. Spintend on other hand can’t figure how to cool fets 🤣🤣
[2022-08-10T19:35:59] Artem Bulashev: Can they combine brands
[2022-08-10T19:37:16] Paolo ⁭: Because if you want small size, you need bigger contact surface
[2022-08-10T19:38:24] Jan: Spintend Box, thats just the worst layout to do cooling
[2022-08-10T19:38:46] Jan: Caps need to go on the other side
[2022-08-10T19:38:49] sombre_enfant: Worst vesc on cooling are spintend
[2022-08-10T19:39:59] Jan: hahaha
[2022-08-10T19:40:17] Paolo ⁭: “Directly”
[2022-08-10T19:40:31] Jan: and now i need the caps diameter of travel to my heat exchanger. Many thanks spintend
[2022-08-10T19:40:38] Paolo ⁭: I told them 1337 times that is useless
[2022-08-10T19:41:36] Jan: I mean i would still consider the box, as i would have something in mind there to cool it, but with zero dimensions of the board/controller size. No thanks
[2022-08-10T19:42:08] Jan: I mean it could be a 500x500mm box
[2022-08-10T19:42:11] Jan: Who knows
[2022-08-10T19:44:52] Jan: If the Focer blows, its this one if the dimensions are right
[2022-08-10T19:47:45] Artem Bulashev: This one will be best yet of Ubox
[2022-08-10T19:48:02] Artem Bulashev: But yeah still don’t figure what side fets need to go
[2022-08-10T19:48:22] Artem Bulashev: But they are on the right track :)
[2022-08-10T19:48:51] Artem Bulashev: It least they don’t blow up as often
[2022-08-10T19:52:20] Jan: a fan? really ? Do they actually drive their scooter or do they just own a roller dynamometer?
[2022-08-10T19:52:36] Jan: That would be the only case it would make sense
[2022-08-10T19:54:38] sombre_enfant: Artem made the 3d
[2022-08-10T19:57:33] Jan: ok
[2022-08-10T19:57:50] Jan: But why a fan? I mean you have the most powerful source already available for cooling
[2022-08-10T19:57:51] Jan: Wind
[2022-08-10T19:58:03] Jan: Its cooling power is even quadratic to the speed
[2022-08-10T20:00:09] Mirono escooters: Spintend and cooling.. i don't like
[2022-08-10T20:14:02] Paolo ⁭: It’s made for one wheel
[2022-08-10T20:14:36] Paolo ⁭: Even at that price I buy flipsky alu pcb
[2022-08-10T20:14:47] Mirono escooters: Is that market so big tho
[2022-08-10T20:14:54] Mirono escooters: Haha finally
[2022-08-10T20:14:59] Mirono escooters: What's price diff
[2022-08-10T20:15:37] Paolo ⁭: 30 dollars I think
[2022-08-10T20:20:26] Jan: Even then, 20kmh is worth more than a blowing fan
[2022-08-10T20:20:48] Jan: And at that speed you have like near zero heat dissipation
[2022-08-10T20:21:07] Paolo ⁭: Yes but one wheel frame is just made by some aluminium profile, there’s no big flat surface like escooter
[2022-08-10T20:22:29] Jan: I have no ideas of one wheels but do you they push 8kW+?
[2022-08-10T20:23:14] Paolo ⁭: No
[2022-08-10T20:23:25] Paolo ⁭: The consumption is very low
[2022-08-10T20:23:46] Paolo ⁭: About 100A phase max and something like 35a battery
[2022-08-10T20:26:05] Jan: I still think the fan is overengineered solution to a problem that doesnt exist 🤷‍♂️
[2022-08-10T20:31:15] Mirono escooters: Agree

[2022-08-10T21:37:31] Artem Bulashev: There is no fan, that image is from some early prototype

[2022-08-11T12:21:08] Artem Bulashev: First cnc anodized assembly 😎 batch has arrived. Ignore the screws 🙂 will be hex countersunk all
[2022-08-11T12:25:51] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Finally got my first vesc compatible controller. Now looking into hooking it up to my 1500W hub motor on a 14S Liion battery
[2022-08-11T12:25:51] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: <photos/photo_5591@11-08-2022_12-25-51.jpg>
[2022-08-11T12:31:02] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Starting out I notice there is no 'ignition' wire to power up or down the controller? And the precharge issue with the internal capacitors and the large current on the main power is still a reason to hook up power directly?
[2022-08-11T12:31:18] Mirono escooters: Ignition wire is for cheap no bra'd controller
[2022-08-11T12:31:53] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Yes, what do you mean?
[2022-08-11T12:32:20] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: How to tell it to disarm and safe energy?
[2022-08-11T12:33:03] Mirono escooters: Not
[2022-08-11T12:39:30] Jan: I had a mini heart attack while looking at the screws 😅
[2022-08-11T12:40:22] Jan: When will the shipment start of the Black without red accent throttles?
[2022-08-11T12:43:02] Artem Bulashev: Soon
[2022-08-11T12:43:08] Artem Bulashev: Was hopping this week
[2022-08-11T12:43:19] Artem Bulashev: But seems like next week
[2022-08-11T12:43:48] Artem Bulashev: Have to do QC and than will start shipping
[2022-08-11T13:12:20] Luis Magalhaes: Looks nice
[2022-08-11T13:21:33] Artem Bulashev: 🤓🤓 - ignore the Philip screws (just assembly test)

[2022-08-11T13:22:01] Artem Bulashev: Here is full set of photos of this test assembly
[2022-08-11T13:23:23] Artem Bulashev: All tolerance QC passed very well 👍 only waiting for screw supplier now and than we start shipping 😁
[2022-08-11T13:28:04] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: I should be able to hack it to switch the power to the step down circuit that creates the gate voltage and the supply to the MCU and sensors...
[2022-08-11T13:28:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: really nice !
[2022-08-11T13:33:23] Mirono escooters: Yes pls
[2022-08-11T13:35:46] Luis Magalhaes: Nice, i will have to buy one of those to test if i like it but not now 😂💪
[2022-08-11T14:22:10] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Inside scoop on my new makerbase MKSESC 75100. It's so efficient, it doesn't even require thermal grease and the cable grommet generously supports water and dust cooling ...
[2022-08-11T14:22:10] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: <photos/photo_5601@11-08-2022_14-22-10.jpg>
[2022-08-11T14:24:22] Mirono escooters: Same as Flipsky
[2022-08-11T14:29:42] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: I suppose the circuit diagram is well published?
[2022-08-11T14:30:01] Mirono escooters: Not reaally
[2022-08-11T14:30:28] Mirono escooters: Add thermal paste Damn even cheaper build the' flipsky
[2022-08-11T14:30:39] sombre_enfant: Mod for on off
[2022-08-11T14:31:00] Mirono escooters: Trace cut the v in pin on the buck boost 🌚🌚🌚
[2022-08-11T14:31:16] Paolo ⁭: You can’t , the only mod possible is to cut track but tracks are very very very tiny, that mean if you try you fuck the vesc forever
[2022-08-11T14:31:40] Mirono escooters: Oef
[2022-08-11T14:31:53] Paolo ⁭: No suce
[2022-08-11T14:42:07] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: I guess it's this trace
[2022-08-11T14:46:14] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: That little SO8 there near the likely stepdown inductor says a23a sct171, but I can't find a data sheet ...
[2022-08-11T15:10:36] Artem Bulashev: Over layed shunt resistors 😂😂
[2022-08-11T15:12:35] Artem Bulashev: That looks incredibly cheap and minimalistic, looks like corners were cut significantly
[2022-08-11T15:19:11] sombre_enfant: Yes its this
[2022-08-11T15:49:23] Unknown: Anyone who has Spintend ADC controller v2, how to reset it? I got faulty input for turn signal - it makes beep sound every second and flash on left turn lamps even no turn signal button connected.
[2022-08-11T16:09:45] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: I think it's quite smart and efficient, and look a the gate drivers for example: EG3112 datasheet https://datasheetspdf.com/mobile/1417749/EGmicro/EG3112/1
[2022-08-11T16:11:51] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Probably measures current on each phase and apparently have completely symmetric phases altogether...
[2022-08-11T16:12:55] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: It's the smallest ebike controller I ever owned...
[2022-08-11T16:20:26] Mirono escooters: Itis smol and good
[2022-08-11T16:28:00] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Oh, and to have the temperature sensing NTC on the FETs is appropriate too!
[2022-08-11T16:37:16] Rowan Ross: You could use the switch to turn on an antispark but that would cost more
[2022-08-11T16:38:46] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: And add losses when using at least 40A to get 2000W...
[2022-08-11T16:39:43] Rowan Ross: Negligible
[2022-08-11T16:40:23] Mirono escooters: Just costs enough
[2022-08-11T16:43:42] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: They must have very low Rdson Fets: Magnachip MDP10N027
[2022-08-11T16:46:32] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: <photos/photo_5604@11-08-2022_16-46-32.jpg>
[2022-08-11T16:49:59] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: EG3112 datasheet https://datasheetspdf.com/mobile/1417749/EGmicro/EG3112/1

[2022-08-11T16:53:31] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: I usually put some spares in stock when I start getting into some new hardware, and this is the first open source solution I am adopting!
[2022-08-11T16:57:27] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: 5#!4 very poor availability on ali x...
[2022-08-11T17:00:01] sombre_enfant: Get ncep01t18
[2022-08-11T17:09:12] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Thanks, but I found the most important parts already...
[2022-08-11T17:39:58] Mirono escooters: I doubt them MOSFETs for that price -_-
[2022-08-11T17:40:06] Mirono escooters: I got proof my shizzl works
[2022-08-11T17:40:18] Mirono escooters: Casing 43-41*
[2022-08-11T17:40:23] Mirono escooters: Heatsinks 39-41

[2022-08-11T17:41:00] Mirono escooters: Same temp as casing so it definitely radiates heat :)
[2022-08-11T17:41:50] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Nice, where did you get them?
[2022-08-11T17:49:55] Mirono escooters: Diy
[2022-08-11T18:09:09] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: The heat sinks?
[2022-08-11T18:10:51] Jan: What is it even, i cannot see it😅
[2022-08-11T18:10:59] Mirono escooters: Motor hub
[2022-08-11T18:11:06] Mirono escooters: Ebike
[2022-08-11T18:11:25] Jan: I see
[2022-08-11T18:11:40] Jan: Did you change something?
[2022-08-11T18:15:02] Mirono escooters: Added ff and heatsinks
[2022-08-11T18:15:25] Jan: How much did it improve?
[2022-08-11T18:16:04] Mirono escooters: Alot :p
[2022-08-11T18:16:16] Mirono escooters: More thermal mass+ way better heat transfer
[2022-08-11T18:34:15] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: 5%!4 now I purchased that App and it doesn't even want to work with my controller?
[2022-08-11T18:36:02] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Is there another app?
[2022-08-11T18:36:25] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Can i change the firmware?
[2022-08-11T18:37:14] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Send pictures (non thermal)
[2022-08-11T18:42:49] Mirono escooters: Rx tx swapped
[2022-08-11T18:42:57] Mirono escooters: Ok
[2022-08-11T18:46:12] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Bingo
[2022-08-11T18:52:51] Mirono escooters: 😘
[2022-08-11T19:10:47] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: 🤗💯🥰
[2022-08-11T19:11:16] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Now I am looking for a good tutorial video...
[2022-08-11T19:12:55] Mirono escooters: Most is self explanatory
[2022-08-11T19:15:17] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Is there a special Vesc compatible Bms?
[2022-08-11T19:16:37] Mirono escooters: Nop
[2022-08-11T19:37:04] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: There is a settings section...
[2022-08-11T19:43:39] Mirono escooters: Ye
[2022-08-11T19:43:46] Mirono escooters: There is
[2022-08-11T19:48:03] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Is it better to use 3.3V for the hall sensor supply?
[2022-08-11T19:49:02] Mirono escooters: No
[2022-08-11T19:49:14] Mirono escooters: Why would it be
[2022-08-11T19:54:32] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: For some reason the generic controllers usually used a 4.3V supply...
[2022-08-11T19:54:47] Mirono escooters: China
[2022-08-11T19:55:32] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Now i I want an analog brake signal generator too!
[2022-08-11T19:56:37] Mirono escooters: Use a ebrake w 3 wires or a throttle as ebrake
[2022-08-11T20:12:08] sombre_enfant: Use dashboard
[2022-08-11T20:24:15] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: I already have 2 throttles because of the front motor. And that simple controller will want a simple switch to turn it off while braking... and that's what i have for now a simple switch...
[2022-08-11T20:27:14] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: This is my design you can theoretically find on thingyverse (don't have the link at hand but user: usertogo)
[2022-08-11T21:37:46] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Is it because the MCU is 3.3V and can only measure in that range?
[2022-08-11T22:03:29] sombre_enfant: It need resistor check pinned
[2022-08-11T22:23:42] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Now I have the throttle hooked up, but have difficulty setting it up to run based on it...
[2022-08-11T22:28:45] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Apparently my throttle is on input val2
[2022-08-11T22:28:45] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: <photos/photo_5619@11-08-2022_22-28-45.jpg>
[2022-08-11T22:30:05] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Val' might need some pulldown because it jumps around...
[2022-08-11T22:32:26] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Why is val2 the wire for Adc1?
[2022-08-11T22:36:05] Ofek 🐥: Better use a PC.. I use the app for logging and temp check
[2022-08-11T22:36:52] Ofek 🐥: Maybe it's maker base version 😂
[2022-08-11T22:44:30] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Ok, I guess I'm done for today, anyway it turns already but it forgets what I already configured and I see no safe config button on the app...
[2022-08-11T22:45:57] Ofek 🐥: Get it working and configured, go for a test ride and then upload new firmware 🤘
[2022-08-11T22:46:31] Ofek 🐥: Maybe wait with the firmware.. We still don't know what version is this board In second look, it seems like V2 👍
[2022-08-11T22:54:23] Ofek 🐥: Is it a spacer? 😂
[2022-08-11T22:57:42] Artem Bulashev: Lol haha
[2022-08-11T22:58:17] Paolo ⁭: Dont use Ali for buy chip
[2022-08-11T22:58:27] Paolo ⁭: 95% that you find are fakes
[2022-08-11T22:58:48] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: I noticed, but I though it was from machining...
[2022-08-11T23:04:36] Ofek 🐥: Measure it next time you open the controller
[2022-08-11T23:10:01] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: This is for an upcoming tadpole trike...
[2022-08-11T23:10:02] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: <photos/photo_5622@11-08-2022_23-10-02.jpg>
[2022-08-11T23:12:01] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: But even these Chinese makerbase vesc are still a bit expensive for low power motors like these hoverboard ones...
[2022-08-11T23:13:47] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Regretable that these are 2V under my 14S full voltage
[2022-08-11T23:20:55] Ofek 🐥: For hoverboard motors I use hoverboard ESC with custom firmware
[2022-08-11T23:23:00] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Ok, good idea, but aren't there countless different boards? Would have to be lucky if I have one that has been hacked already?
[2022-08-11T23:23:51] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: And then the 36V limit?

[2022-08-12T12:50:42] Mirko Boni: Good morning everyone!
[2022-08-12T12:51:11] Mirko Boni: In your opinion these are important messages in the bms?
[2022-08-12T12:51:15] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_5624@12-08-2022_12-51-15.jpg>
[2022-08-12T12:51:43] Mirko Boni: Can anyone explain to me if I need to change something in the setup?
[2022-08-12T12:52:34] Tommy: Credo che intenda solo che i MOSFET della carica sono attivi e pure quelli della scarica Che poi se non sbaglio è common Port quindi...
[2022-08-12T12:52:51] Mirko Boni: Ciao Tommy! Ti ringrazio
[2022-08-12T13:54:38] sombre_enfant: Just the sleep active it
[2022-08-12T15:09:38] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: I am on it with the PC now, and I think the firmware was updated... Still can't figure out how to set up the throttle control yet...
[2022-08-12T15:09:39] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: <photos/photo_5626@12-08-2022_15-09-39.jpg>
[2022-08-12T15:11:04] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Also, why does it identify a 75_300_R2 when I have a 75100?
[2022-08-12T15:12:00] Paolo ⁭: You installed different firmware
[2022-08-12T15:14:02] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Different?
[2022-08-12T15:43:18] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: These options are totally cryptic to me...
[2022-08-12T15:43:52] Mirono escooters: Prob modded by them
[2022-08-12T15:44:00] Mirono escooters: U got ebrake?
[2022-08-12T15:44:07] Mirono escooters: If o'ly throttle.. choose current
[2022-08-12T15:56:44] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: I haven't hooked up the brake switch, I suspect I need a pullup?
[2022-08-12T15:57:53] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: And in spite of having used the Adc pin next ground it activates chan2
[2022-08-12T15:58:55] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Why are the options called current when actually a voltage is measured?
[2022-08-12T16:08:05] Mirono escooters: :????
[2022-08-12T16:08:15] Mirono escooters: I control current with ur throttle..
[2022-08-12T16:15:45] Ofek 🐥: I use this mode on my scooter. I have low side brake (simple switch connect signal to ground) I used a pullup resistor and reversed ADC2 reading, so I get throttle disconnect when applying brakes ( I don't use regen yet)
[2022-08-12T16:32:22] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: I don't get how inefficient the programming is done here. There should be simply Throttle ->chose input; Brake->chose input, with range and reverse linearity options
[2022-08-12T16:32:57] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: How to get these suggestions to the programmers?
[2022-08-12T16:33:39] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Or is it because I use the free version?
[2022-08-12T16:34:04] Mirono escooters: No.. its as basic as it gets..
[2022-08-12T16:34:12] Mirono escooters: U cant get ot simpler.
[2022-08-12T16:34:36] Mirono escooters: Its not rocket science..
[2022-08-12T16:35:56] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Not on the version i have here!
[2022-08-12T16:36:34] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Ridiculous drop down menu with cryptic options...
[2022-08-12T16:41:35] sombre_enfant: Its alright
[2022-08-12T16:53:46] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Or is it because I am in the 'Wizard' and am missing the expert mode? Quite possibly the programmer hasn't looked at that part since last century?
[2022-08-12T16:59:27] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: I also need to be getting back on endless sphere too, you guys don't know an admin there that could unblock me?
[2022-08-12T16:59:36] Mirono escooters: No....
[2022-08-12T16:59:39] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2022-08-12T17:00:42] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Kicked because about some philosophical contributions around CV1984 😭
[2022-08-12T17:23:56] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: I could probably create a new account, but then how can I maintain my stuff...
[2022-08-12T17:35:30] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: I am thinking how to put hall sensors and magnets on my brake levers to get nice resolution on that section between idle and pre-engagment point
[2022-08-12T17:47:44] Ofek 🐥: You can do everything manually.. The wizards only do it automatically
[2022-08-12T23:44:53] rosheee: Ehehhe
[2022-08-12T23:45:12] rosheee: Adding temp sensor later xD need ya help teh please This time i rly do it

[2022-08-13T02:20:30] rosheee: Since motor is more than 2kg ebike motor could work?
[2022-08-13T02:20:46] rosheee: @Ghost_911 uses this
[2022-08-13T02:21:47] rosheee: Shit i get fire extinguisher rdy
[2022-08-13T02:23:03] Mirono escooters: I always use that detector
[2022-08-13T02:24:36] rosheee: ebike for escooter?

[2022-08-13T02:30:54] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-08-13T02:31:11] Mirono escooters: Its only auto detection. Your motors are as thic aq baqic ebike
[2022-08-13T02:31:23] Mirono escooters: I use it always
[2022-08-13T02:31:34] Mirono escooters: Is just detection current not much more
[2022-08-13T02:37:48] rosheee: Ok
[2022-08-13T02:37:50] rosheee: I do it
[2022-08-13T02:38:24] rosheee: And what settings?

[2022-08-13T16:34:57] Unknown: Did someone get faulty spintend ubox controller recently? Today mine has no light/power on ESCB part and motor connected to ESCA started to run in opposite direction. Has anyone had same issue?
[2022-08-13T16:35:59] sombre_enfant: Just set it
[2022-08-13T16:36:56] Unknown: ?
[2022-08-13T16:45:24] rosheee: Kaabo kelly

[2022-08-13T16:47:54] rosheee: Redo settings
[2022-08-13T16:48:00] rosheee: Set invert then
[2022-08-13T16:50:24] Unknown: Why? Escb is not working at all..I don't want only one motor working
[2022-08-13T16:50:39] Unknown: And actually something happened to Bluetooth connection too..
[2022-08-13T16:51:15] Unknown: I get this
[2022-08-13T16:54:19] Face de Pin Sucé: yeaaaaah
[2022-08-13T17:19:45] rosheee: Reflash
[2022-08-13T17:19:52] rosheee: Use the can cable
[2022-08-13T17:19:55] rosheee: Wait
[2022-08-13T17:20:32] rosheee: <files/How to flash firmware through SWD interface - EN (1).pdf>
[2022-08-13T17:24:16] Unknown: Thank you..just wondering if such issue can happen with someone else, I did nothing, only rided first 300 meters on scooter
[2022-08-13T17:28:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what did you plug on it ?
[2022-08-13T17:29:12] Unknown: Nothing..only rided for short trip as usual
[2022-08-13T17:30:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's not the question. you have plugged things on it. throttle (powered in 5v ?), uart ?
[2022-08-13T17:31:16] Unknown: What do you mean "plugged things on it"?? And you asked me question, I answered
[2022-08-13T17:32:19] Unknown: Throttle is set to 'ADC' as Amy from spintend explained to me
[2022-08-13T17:33:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: how did you power the throttle ? 3.3v ? 5v ?
[2022-08-13T17:33:22] Unknown: 3.3
[2022-08-13T17:33:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok, good
[2022-08-13T17:35:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if no led, 2 possibilities : 1/ escb stm32 is fried 2/ escb stm32 program is corrupted. need reflash
[2022-08-13T17:37:14] Unknown: If I set Bluetooth to esca, I see error as on screenshot above, if I set Bluetooth to escb, no device pops up at all in scan
[2022-08-13T17:38:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: since escb stm32 is not running (what the led status is saying), it's 'normal'
[2022-08-13T17:39:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: so, as @roscheeee says, first step is try reprogram it. can you take a picture of leds ?
[2022-08-13T17:40:06] Unknown: I am in bed now. I can do it later
[2022-08-14T00:33:32] Luis Magalhaes: kaabo vesc is in the past 🤣🤣
[2022-08-14T00:33:57] Luis Magalhaes: what kelly are you going to use?

[2022-08-14T04:06:13] Paolo ⁭: ?
[2022-08-14T04:06:37] rosheee: 7230 ahs 2 phase wires per phase
[2022-08-14T04:07:13] Paolo ⁭: Oh u want single phase
[2022-08-14T04:08:48] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_5640@14-08-2022_04-08-48.jpg>
[2022-08-14T04:12:09] rosheee: yes from 2 wires -> 1 wire
[2022-08-14T04:23:43] Face de Pin Sucé: Juste solder 2 wires together
[2022-08-14T04:25:00] rosheee: Yes but then 8mm will be very very hard
[2022-08-14T04:37:24] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-08-14T04:50:21] rosheee: Today frame for controllers is rdy then just solder and wh00p
[2022-08-14T04:54:47] rosheee: 91kmh with 20s without FW
[2022-08-14T04:54:58] rosheee: Rion esc firmware is strange
[2022-08-14T05:01:29] rosheee: 210A battery 6V sag
[2022-08-14T05:03:28] rosheee: idk spintend much more b00st than tronics
[2022-08-14T05:04:08] rosheee: and still no warranty controller received 😢

[2022-08-14T05:07:46] rosheee: still not working?
[2022-08-14T06:20:08] rosheee: Not drivable..spinning wheel at 60-70..aiai
[2022-08-14T06:35:54] Unknown: In your instruction it shows that inputs of hall sensor A connected to inputs of hall sensor B. Why? And I don't have such cable

[2022-08-14T07:11:36] Unknown: BTW, I don't have such cable, spintend didn't ship it, they attached a lot of garbage cables with the parcel but without this one(5 wires, 2 connectors)
[2022-08-14T07:14:49] Unknown: Seems they wrongly attached 4 wires cable instead of SWD cable
[2022-08-14T07:31:44] rosheee: ^^'..
[2022-08-14T07:31:57] rosheee: Csble has 4
[2022-08-14T07:32:00] rosheee: If u read manuaö
[2022-08-14T07:32:02] rosheee: Manual i send u
[2022-08-14T07:32:57] rosheee: 1. Use the CAN cable to bridge the SWD ports of the ESC on both sides (we leave the RST idle , because the RST of the SWD socket is usually not needed).
[2022-08-14T07:33:05] rosheee: Port has 5
[2022-08-14T07:33:12] rosheee: Cable has 4
[2022-08-14T07:33:26] rosheee: And RST NOT NEEDED = 4 LANES
[2022-08-14T07:33:37] rosheee: so use this as described
[2022-08-14T07:33:49] rosheee: In the port they wrote in the manual
[2022-08-14T07:33:55] Unknown: Oh ok
[2022-08-14T07:34:02] rosheee: Just read ^^'
[2022-08-14T07:34:06] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-08-14T07:34:43] Unknown: Do I need to switch off internal canbus then(7 times to push power button)?
[2022-08-14T07:51:30] rosheee: No
[2022-08-14T07:51:34] rosheee: Just do what they write there
[2022-08-14T07:51:52] rosheee: XD it is an official spintend manual
[2022-08-14T07:53:40] Unknown: I tried..autoconnect works(only esca, not escb) but I click connect on "SWD prog" menu, it shows 'Could not connect to target'

[2022-08-14T07:55:01] rosheee: No
[2022-08-14T07:55:14] rosheee: U connected to esc a
[2022-08-14T07:55:20] rosheee: Pressed auto connect

[2022-08-14T07:55:31] rosheee: Connect
[2022-08-14T07:55:52] Unknown: Yes, I did usb-c connection to esca
[2022-08-14T07:56:30] Unknown: Autoconnect works(shows firmware) but if I click 'connect' on SWD menu, it shows as on photo above
[2022-08-14T07:58:28] rosheee: U stay connected Right?
[2022-08-14T08:00:41] Unknown: Yes

[2022-08-14T17:03:15] Mirono escooters: Made
[2022-08-14T17:03:43] Mirono escooters: Well ye bought fins but separate. Mounted myself with diy

[2022-08-14T20:09:18] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Who sells these fins other than Grin Tech?
[2022-08-14T20:09:42] Mirono escooters: Diy :)
[2022-08-14T20:10:14] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: How?
[2022-08-14T20:12:13] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: I had to swap the adc ports to get it running BTW...

[2022-08-14T20:12:19] Mirono escooters: I did exactly this
[2022-08-14T20:12:42] Mirono escooters: Works beautifully as u can see on pics
[2022-08-14T20:19:14] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: And did you add the statorade?
[2022-08-14T20:19:26] Mirono escooters: Of course
[2022-08-14T20:19:46] Mirono escooters: Heatsinks almost useless without.. need to transfer the heat
[2022-08-14T20:20:00] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Where Grin still is the only supplier...
[2022-08-14T20:20:38] Mirono escooters: Ferrofluid is generic Statorade is patented grin
[2022-08-14T20:21:53] Mirono escooters: I used ferrofluid. Not the brand stuff Once im not lazy ill hook up inside temp sensor and see how good it conducts but i do know it works, before and after way more heat at casing (and thats good)
[2022-08-14T20:22:14] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Yes, I know and as I understand no other ferrofluid has the needed characteristics?
[2022-08-14T20:22:25] Mirono escooters: Eh.
[2022-08-14T20:22:46] Mirono escooters: Statorade is "optimised for the heat and transfer characteristics"
[2022-08-14T20:22:52] Mirono escooters: But i read blabla market
[2022-08-14T20:23:00] Mirono escooters: Some agree some disagree.
[2022-08-14T20:23:49] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Maybe it can be refreshed with ATF or something...
[2022-08-14T20:23:56] Mirono escooters: Statorade is, better. I won't argue But basic shit works well enough. If u push shit like roschee. Yzs statorade Like us? Regular ff is fine
[2022-08-14T20:36:04] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: No clues on the roughness? - really makes me wonder if it even remembers the settings from auto detection???
[2022-08-14T20:37:22] Mirono escooters: Saved it?
[2022-08-14T20:37:24] Mirono escooters: Halls?
[2022-08-14T20:40:58] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: How to safe it? I am using the android app again...
[2022-08-14T20:42:14] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: I might have to go on swapping sensor wires ?
[2022-08-14T20:42:23] Mirono escooters: Try sensorless
[2022-08-14T20:47:54] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Sucks, spins during config, but not even in the test after correcting spinning direction...
[2022-08-14T20:48:16] Mirono escooters: Something wrong with wiring/ vesc
[2022-08-14T21:01:49] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: If then only with software...
[2022-08-14T21:02:56] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Which in my opinion has been neglected for making 2€ from each user...
[2022-08-14T21:04:25] Mirono escooters: 2?
[2022-08-14T21:04:27] Mirono escooters: Horror
[2022-08-14T21:04:29] Mirono escooters: Where 2
[2022-08-14T21:39:51] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: In the app store...
[2022-08-14T21:41:02] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Maybe its because I am testing this from a 5m cable to my battery- then again it moves smoothly in detection...
[2022-08-14T21:41:45] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Anyway done 4 today...
[2022-08-14T22:00:43] Mirono escooters: Lol thats for the payment to google to keep it on PlayStore🤨🤨
[2022-08-14T22:22:33] Izuna 生活: What type of connectors does Spintend use on the Ubox?
[2022-08-14T22:33:22] rosheee: Jst
[2022-08-14T22:34:13] rosheee: U paid for vesc t00l?
[2022-08-14T22:34:20] Izuna 生活: kk thanks
[2022-08-14T22:35:46] rosheee: Tractioncontrol is best
[2022-08-14T23:20:45] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: By the way I implemented the ignition switch, and it's a good one...
[2022-08-15T12:41:15] Unknown: I talked with Amy from spintend..bad news..she asked me to measure Vcc pin on SWD port(escb), it shows only 0.6V instead of 3.3V..and she said CPU is faulty in this reason, they want me to ship for repair🤮
[2022-08-15T12:46:22] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Anybody ever tried to flood the motor inside with some non corrosive coolant so that the coils also remain wet?
[2022-08-15T12:46:36] Mirono escooters: Oil
[2022-08-15T12:46:51] Mirono escooters: But ff superior and less leak
[2022-08-15T12:48:01] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Yes the cable channel and the bearings are the likely leaking points...
[2022-08-15T12:49:37] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Don't know would have to be the liquid with the smallest resistance to shear forces and the highest heat capacity...
[2022-08-15T12:51:32] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: But ferrofluid supposedly has little effect on improving magnetism and the coils are not directly cooled at all
[2022-08-15T12:52:49] Mirono escooters: What? Not cooled??
[2022-08-15T12:53:04] Mirono escooters: You mean ff 🤨😂
[2022-08-15T12:53:54] Mirono escooters: Ferrofluid transfers heat go magnets and to environment. Otherwise the air inside with little thermal conductivity acts like a insulator
[2022-08-15T12:53:58] Mirono escooters: Ff is best we got
[2022-08-15T12:59:19] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: You put few ml of ff just for the magnetic gap, but you could put much more ATF (like described here https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=37972 ) and possibly allow your coils to withstand much more momentary power...
[2022-08-15T13:39:37] Mirono escooters: Sounds interesting. Would need to see tests tho
[2022-08-15T13:44:48] Martin Kaktits: why not both 😜
[2022-08-15T13:54:11] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Probably works because the magnetic particles will stay in the places of the strongest field...
[2022-08-15T14:21:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: new light board with 4 mosfets 😉
[2022-08-15T18:30:14] Jan: Anyone worked with the traction control settings yet?
[2022-08-15T18:59:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: traction control is one of best features of vesc. it works great and prevent from most tires skids
[2022-08-15T19:00:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: front tire last much longer 😁
[2022-08-15T19:03:26] Кирилл: Just enable it and set minimum erpm difference?
[2022-08-15T19:03:59] Кирилл: Only for can bus
[2022-08-15T19:06:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes
[2022-08-15T19:07:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes. both controllers has be linked by can bus to exchange informations about each motor speed
[2022-08-15T19:15:31] Jan: We tried traction control and it worked but the esc's heated up a lot more now. More the double the heat than before. And a lot less power, like 5kW was missing (18kW to 13kW). I thought could be the front motor but assuming else it would be free spinning, it cant be. Something just doesnt work
[2022-08-15T19:16:39] Кирилл: Yes, it will eat up watts a bit
[2022-08-15T19:17:28] Кирилл: Could be something with software code or just you gets more efficient watts then bigger values and a lot of spins without traction
[2022-08-15T19:18:54] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Size comparison to the yuanking 72V 80A controller I had in the fat bike before, and looking into added cooling...

[2022-08-15T19:19:28] Mirono escooters: I will mount my vesc inside such a casing
[2022-08-15T19:19:32] Mirono escooters: (sabvoton)
[2022-08-15T19:19:59] Jan: Yeah but that was like 30%
[2022-08-15T19:20:22] Jan: There needs to be a better way
[2022-08-15T19:20:31] Jan: Erpm power curve?
[2022-08-15T19:21:15] Кирилл: Probably
[2022-08-15T19:51:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no reason for such power difference. it simply reduce speed of the 'winning' motor if erpm difference is too high
[2022-08-15T19:56:59] Mikhail Fedotov: depends on the algorithm used. there is nothing simple in it especially if the speed is reduced by applying power
[2022-08-15T20:01:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: vedder explanation : "Traction control can also be enabled, which reduces the torque on motors that spin faster than the slowest motor proportional to their speed difference."
[2022-08-15T20:03:56] Mikhail Fedotov: The "proportonal" part is the most suspect. Some other curve might be better. Or not. The idea is that it should be based on load, speed difference gives an idea about the load difference but a pretty rough one I think.
[2022-08-15T20:30:46] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: With more FETs?
[2022-08-15T20:39:13] Mirono escooters: No
[2022-08-15T20:39:16] Mirono escooters: Just heatsinks
[2022-08-15T21:16:29] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Why not just devise some water cooling on the small controller
[2022-08-15T21:32:19] Mirono escooters: Eh hard and water
[2022-08-15T21:32:51] Jan: Water is a medium of transport and acts also like a thermal mass (which is not always wanted). I dont think there is a TDP high enough in the scooter area that it is worth to use as heat transport. The disadvantages are too big for it to be worth.
[2022-08-15T21:33:49] Jan: What you want is heat exchange and the only thing you got is air surrounding your scooter. With enough speed you get quite some convection, that means the more exchange surface you have, the more heat you can dissipate
[2022-08-15T21:36:20] Jan: What the problem is, how can you reach the most heat exchange surface in the shortest amount of time from the mosfet surface. The answer is high thermal conductivity of materials and short distances

[2022-08-15T21:37:26] Jan: Where does the heat go? Into the block and then where?
[2022-08-15T21:37:31] Mirono escooters: Show pcb pls

[2022-08-15T21:39:42] asyan4ik: temperature dropped from 80 to 45
[2022-08-15T21:40:01] Jan: The block will heat up and stay there for quite a while
[2022-08-15T21:40:17] Jan: Its just thermal mass in the system

[2022-08-15T21:41:41] asyan4ik: yes, I know . it was a replacement for the native controller with vesc
[2022-08-15T21:42:40] asyan4ik: Current limits motor 150-160a , batt 80a
[2022-08-15T21:44:01] Mirono escooters: Lol thats a cool scoot
[2022-08-15T21:46:04] asyan4ik: yeah, if not for the dead controller
[2022-08-15T21:48:27] asyan4ik: Antispark ;)
[2022-08-15T21:49:12] asyan4ik: was later redone

[2022-08-16T10:25:05] Thierry: Hi, when I use detect and calculate parameters and apply settings, the motor is crackling and have abs over current error. There is big difference between parameters from setup motors foc and detection, see picture. I do not have any error with initial parameters. Do I made a mistake?
[2022-08-16T12:19:29] sombre_enfant: Run auto detect
[2022-08-16T13:19:53] Thierry: You mean on motor settings->Foc button RL and lambda?
