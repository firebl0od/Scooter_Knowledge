[2025-03-10T22:43:30] haku: this guy is chinese but korean made scooter?
[2025-03-10T22:46:47] JPPL: Thor300 x 2 AIO ready to send who wants? 😝
[2025-03-10T22:48:29] Yamal: It's something I should have done a long time ago, changing the old aluminum axle for the new steel one
[2025-03-10T22:49:01] Yamal: This man it’s Michael Sha creator of the Nami viper
[2025-03-10T22:50:45] Yamal: No,, 100x100 China scooter

[2025-03-11T01:51:04] haku: specially now you know some cad
[2025-03-11T01:51:13] Noname: I can I'm just sick of building all day and night

[2025-03-11T14:39:34] Rose: Hey there Theshopla, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-03-11T14:39:40] Rose: Hey there Theshopla, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-03-11T15:31:43] haku: tronic x12 is shit dude? no reviews yet lets not too be hasty to shit on em now
[2025-03-11T15:34:31] haku: they did shit on thier reputation on the old 6fet tronics though. but thatbisnt thier design isnt it? its mini focer or whatever it is?
[2025-03-11T15:41:53] Mirono escooters: How do you guys track your scooters and bikes? We have successfully retrieved a stolen bike with a Samsung smarttag once, and were very lucky we had it in the bike. I know, in the scale of things, 20-25€ per tracker isn't a lot. But it still stings. The apple ones are widely cloned by china, but the Samsung ones don't seem to be possible? Anyone has a source for a Samsung tracker clone? It would be for less expensive rolling gear.
[2025-03-11T15:42:27] Mirono escooters: I will combine apple and Samsung trackers, best change of retrieval. 50€ per rolling vehicle is.. a lot 🤣
[2025-03-11T15:43:52] Matte: perhaps drone guys have this sorted already as some of them load up a flight map ahead of time and then only track it by LTE or similar https://maker.pro/particle/projects/build-a-gps-tracker-for-your-drone
[2025-03-11T15:44:08] Matte: they dont even fly the drone, it does its mission on its own
[2025-03-11T15:44:29] Matte: i dont know the cost of any of this, just an idea of where to look
[2025-03-11T15:46:46] Jason: smasnug smart tag 2
[2025-03-11T15:46:53] Jason: but planning for gps Iot
[2025-03-11T15:50:52] haku: who is that son of a bitch yamal. tell me
[2025-03-11T15:51:30] haku: good question. i need one too
[2025-03-11T15:58:21] Yamal: It’s okay man , just he make me angry about 6am
[2025-03-11T15:59:40] Yamal: I need to talk to the admins of this group, who seem to think that it is not enough to kick them out once.
[2025-03-11T16:03:05] haku: if i was admin best believe criminals and heathens will be deported
[2025-03-11T16:03:23] haku: who is this double agent your talking about?
[2025-03-11T16:03:43] Yamal: It’s private man
[2025-03-11T16:04:19] haku: leave elon alone! dam you whoever you are
[2025-03-11T16:07:07] haku: tesla lives matter!
[2025-03-11T16:50:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: ?
[2025-03-11T16:54:15] haku: deploy the tesla robots!
[2025-03-11T16:54:51] haku: arm them with mp5s
[2025-03-11T16:55:10] Mirono escooters: Ye we got those. But spensiv
[2025-03-11T16:55:17] Mirono escooters: Oh well, grand scheme of things don't matter ig
[2025-03-11T17:16:01] haku: arm them with javelines
[2025-03-11T17:17:31] GABE: 50 to refind 2000 is good.
[2025-03-11T17:18:39] haku: mount 50cals on your cybertrucks. defend yourselves
[2025-03-11T17:19:37] GABE: could also make a switch that shocks vbat to frame to deter thiefs
[2025-03-11T17:20:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Hey @albeeeerttttt @jamaludin_algarnati @SibClimb Im having hard time with stabling my thunder 2 I'm getting wobbles on 80-90 (I'll elaborate a bit) I had only front brake on those runs I'll share photos that show arms height
[2025-03-11T17:20:37] GABE: negative on left handlebar positive on right, only way to use is have good gloves
[2025-03-11T17:20:57] GABE: ring on left and right handlebar
[2025-03-11T17:20:58] GABE: lol
[2025-03-11T17:21:12] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Current high (yet to ride like this)
[2025-03-11T17:21:26] GABE: imagine a nice 32s shock on some asshole.
[2025-03-11T17:21:43] GABE: probably enough to make them fuck off even after they took the lock off
[2025-03-11T17:22:29] GABE: 135 fucking volts
[2025-03-11T17:22:52] Jason: lo
[2025-03-11T17:23:04] GABE: i think they cant get go off thar
[2025-03-11T17:23:06] GABE: holy shit
[2025-03-11T17:23:20] GABE: im pretty fkn sure
[2025-03-11T17:23:26] GABE: thats stronger than 110v american ac also designede to go directly through your heart
[2025-03-11T17:23:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Other 2 options of arm highet that changes a little in the wobbling aggressiveness
[2025-03-11T17:23:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_21958@11-03-2025_17-23-47.jpg>
[2025-03-11T17:27:15] Yamal: Beautiful, one of the many good things about the DT Thunder, is that you can adjust the height of the scooter
[2025-03-11T17:29:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What is the "right" height ?
[2025-03-11T17:29:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: This one ?
[2025-03-11T17:30:09] Yamal: The one you like the most, I would say the lower one makes it more stable for high speeds, but for high off-roading I don't know...
[2025-03-11T17:30:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The problem is that it could be too many factors that make it unstable 1arm height 2 tire quality and pressure 3 brake being only front for now 4 different motors harder to center
[2025-03-11T17:31:21] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I like what stable for high speed am a road animal
[2025-03-11T17:32:12] Yamal: Second option look good
[2025-03-11T17:32:22] Yamal: Like lower .?
[2025-03-11T17:32:43] Jan: Its just shitty ass trail
[2025-03-11T17:33:07] Jan: Dualtron has no idea what they are doing, zero understanding of steering geometry
[2025-03-11T17:33:28] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Look bro to others it's stable so it's just a case of I'm not setting it up right (I have a dumper also)
[2025-03-11T17:33:42] Jan: And zero understanding of bending moments with their toothpick pole collar clamps which is the worst in the industry
[2025-03-11T17:34:07] Jan: If you ever compare it to an actual stable one its worlds apart
[2025-03-11T17:34:33] skrtt: Imo its the tires and having just front brake
[2025-03-11T17:35:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I also think they are stock shit tyres and they don't like to be in an angle
[2025-03-11T17:37:37] skrtt: Maybe try to buy the xuangxeng pmt clones to see if it changes a bit
[2025-03-11T17:37:53] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But I don't know if the wheel is centered
[2025-03-11T17:37:58] GABE: she snuck back in gmmm
[2025-03-11T17:38:03] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Cmt yes I know those
[2025-03-11T17:38:08] GABE: Think we got a lost cat here
[2025-03-11T17:38:11] GABE: She needed water
[2025-03-11T17:38:19] GABE: idk how I knew but I felt it it's pretty sunny out
[2025-03-11T17:38:20] skrtt: But thats weird because i have a friend that has kelly on the t2 and he doesnt even have a damper
[2025-03-11T17:38:36] skrtt: And he swears that she dont wobble. Also stock height
[2025-03-11T17:38:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Stock height I don't think I tried
[2025-03-11T17:40:57] skrtt: But thats really weird cuz on mu victor i went 100 quite sometimes (downhill ofc) and never wobble it
[2025-03-11T17:41:04] skrtt: Stock height and lower
[2025-03-11T17:41:15] JPPL: https://www.tiktok.com/@techlithium?_t=ZN-8ubC3TEc8PO&_r=1
[2025-03-11T17:41:28] JPPL: Its on portuguese but good things
[2025-03-11T17:48:27] Mirono escooters: We once found dad's stolen bike. Dude stole at night, and hid in forest. We were lucky someone passed by and pinged it. Expensive ebike. Dad already called it lost till I saw the ping
[2025-03-11T17:49:58] Mirono escooters: Sad my bluey is gone forever. My best scoot 😠😭
[2025-03-11T17:54:00] Dualtron Achilleus: Where phase amps
[2025-03-11T17:54:10] Dualtron Achilleus: We dont see
[2025-03-11T17:56:42] GABE: motor amps 200
[2025-03-11T17:57:03] GABE: and 80a fwk
[2025-03-11T17:59:19] haku: how does this motor work? https://youtu.be/Q9Zgm6snbrQ?si=FPm4eqseSs5XiA39
[2025-03-11T18:03:51] haku: is it BS marketing.
[2025-03-11T18:04:51] haku: do you not have motion detect cameras boy?
[2025-03-11T18:04:52] Lieven L.: Black magic
[2025-03-11T18:05:49] haku: yes. i dont believe it till its in production
[2025-03-11T18:06:05] Lieven L.: if you want a more power dense motor you need to go axial flux
[2025-03-11T18:07:53] haku: i expect an mg42 on the roof just waiting for thieves from you
[2025-03-11T18:08:00] Lieven L.: Or a combination of radial and axial flux. Like Koenigsegg does with their "Raxial Flux" motor
[2025-03-11T18:08:52] haku: idk what that is but this motor on video looks like a lie. but who knows
[2025-03-11T18:08:57] Lieven L.: And 6 phases for more kaboom
[2025-03-11T18:09:57] Lieven L.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCO633KE7RA&t=1s
[2025-03-11T18:10:30] haku: yes i like this guy
[2025-03-11T18:10:56] Lieven L.: Axial flux uses disks. So the magnets are on a disk and not on a ring arround the stator
[2025-03-11T18:11:05] haku: i see
[2025-03-11T18:20:03] Lieven L.: Another good explaination video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICTi2Z_X5Kw
[2025-03-11T18:20:49] haku: this is all china tech?
[2025-03-11T18:21:18] Lieven L.: No, the first electric motor was axial flux
[2025-03-11T18:21:35] Lieven L.: very old tech so not limited to anybody
[2025-03-11T18:22:24] Lieven L.: radial flux is just cheaper to produce
[2025-03-11T18:22:35] haku: look at this commercial. https://youtube.com/shorts/kFPe_cfyOQU?si=yItQOmNMNTv3ylIk
[2025-03-11T18:24:17] Lieven L.: Well they us a radial flux motor with a hollow stator.
[2025-03-11T18:24:47] haku: how do they liquid cool that
[2025-03-11T18:25:12] haku: no space
[2025-03-11T18:25:19] Rose: Hey there Baki0546, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-03-11T18:26:04] Lieven L.: They don't. I can only see phase wires but no coolant lines
[2025-03-11T18:26:54] Lieven L.: Same concept: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB7pBrudFbg
[2025-03-11T18:27:36] Mirono escooters: And then what
[2025-03-11T18:27:44] Mirono escooters: It was 3am and he left in a minute, prolly masked
[2025-03-11T18:28:36] Mirono escooters: We know wich street, and if we had the time we could've just waited for him But what point. Also I got the bike back rest idc much
[2025-03-11T18:28:41] haku: attack dog bark then bang bang
[2025-03-11T18:29:01] Mirono escooters: Tis not a western movie
[2025-03-11T18:29:17] haku: you need a heathen howling dog
[2025-03-11T18:31:21] haku: yes ive seen this haha. its just bearing rotating the wheels lmao
[2025-03-11T18:31:28] haku: so fucked
[2025-03-11T18:32:19] haku: where you from are you allowed to arm yourself? for self defense?
[2025-03-11T18:37:24] Mirono escooters: I'm not fighting someone that's stealing a bike
[2025-03-11T18:37:24] haku: look at this. all machined titanium looks like https://youtu.be/6-vezmptzEo?si=e_GtFo56Hi_kISCp
[2025-03-11T18:37:32] Mirono escooters: 25k lol
[2025-03-11T18:37:46] haku: its your property. up to you dude
[2025-03-11T18:37:54] Mirono escooters: I'm not risking muh life for a bike
[2025-03-11T18:38:10] haku: but its still your property. just saying
[2025-03-11T18:38:31] haku: if you let these heathens do whatever they will not stop.
[2025-03-11T18:40:52] haku: idk how far on the spectrum this guy is but this is too many parts. jeez
[2025-03-11T18:43:30] haku: look at the brakes though. he machined it to fit moto brakes
[2025-03-11T18:44:41] haku: stator looks like 200h
[2025-03-11T18:44:41] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-03-11T19:07:29] GABE: entirely different stator size btw.
[2025-03-11T19:09:39] haku: too bad he didnt choose vesc
[2025-03-11T19:09:57] haku: he wouldve been a superstar
[2025-03-11T19:18:46] GABE: Pfft, how dare you be educated before spending "25k"
[2025-03-11T19:22:15] GABE: Longer leads will also pull heat out of a device
[2025-03-11T19:22:22] GABE: my engineer friend just blew my mind
[2025-03-11T19:22:28] GABE: this makes total sense Longer leads would infact pull heat from a power stage.
[2025-03-11T19:24:46] haku: wtf are you talking about
[2025-03-11T19:25:10] haku: boy you better not mix substances
[2025-03-11T20:03:23] GABE: therefore oversizing wires would reduce heat on powerstage?

[2025-03-11T21:45:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: There is no way to source them not from "name brands"?
[2025-03-11T21:46:11] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Because 40€ it's a lot before shipping
[2025-03-11T21:46:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I just need to know what are the pieces I need to get I'll find the individually
[2025-03-11T21:50:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What about rubber rings ?
[2025-03-11T21:50:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: That will seal?
[2025-03-11T21:51:23] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ok thanks (for now I don't know/think I need that mod )

[2025-03-11T22:15:39] skrtt: Btw one thing that maybe is causing ur wobbles is the nutt the steering column may not be thight
[2025-03-11T22:28:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I don't think so because it's tight (if you are talking about those red rings)
[2025-03-11T22:28:55] GABE: @jamessoderstrom
[2025-03-11T22:29:04] skrtt: Yep
[2025-03-11T22:31:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So no because I can't remove them even if my life depends on it
[2025-03-11T22:34:25] skrtt: They might be “glued” and not tighten properly
[2025-03-11T22:34:26] Newuser G: Hi guys 😎

[2025-03-11T22:36:36] Newuser G: How much can I put as maximum setting for engine brake in the CURRENT schede with this engine? Thanks
[2025-03-11T22:54:25] Jan: Whats that a 45H or 50H?
[2025-03-11T23:00:12] Hackintoshhhh: Blade are 45H
[2025-03-11T23:17:19] Jan: Technically max saturation limit of the motor

[2025-03-11T23:18:27] Newuser G: A safe setting?
[2025-03-11T23:19:03] Jan: Before any damage occurs to the motor, you blow 10 controllers and 10 batteries
[2025-03-11T23:20:07] Newuser G: I mean a safe setting for vesc
[2025-03-11T23:20:51] Jan: Then you have to specify what you actually have
[2025-03-11T23:22:09] Newuser G: I have 2 75100 modded

[2025-03-11T23:58:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I clear it with the spacer just nearly and with 90/65/6.5 tyres but there is an odd noise that I can't pin point what it is
[2025-03-11T23:59:53] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <video_file>
[2025-03-12T00:07:16] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also how normal is the pads touching

[2025-03-12T00:10:22] skrtt: The disk is touching tha caliper
[2025-03-12T00:10:38] skrtt: The caliper itself not the pads
[2025-03-12T00:14:49] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Now ?
[2025-03-12T00:15:07] skrtt: Yes
[2025-03-12T00:15:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <video_file>
[2025-03-12T00:15:55] skrtt: Try to lift the caliper a little to see if still do that noise
[2025-03-12T00:17:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also is it better to get 100/55/6.5 ? Currently have 90/65/6.5
[2025-03-12T00:18:02] skrtt: 100/55 will touch the banjo probabily
[2025-03-12T00:18:03] JPPL: 100 is larger
[2025-03-12T00:19:20] skrtt: Get some juniores 90/65

[2025-03-12T00:21:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: This is 2.5 but you right
[2025-03-12T00:21:47] skrtt: If i dont want go with xuangxeng “stradale” (90/60)
[2025-03-12T00:21:54] Paolo ⁭: You need go for zoom or Logan for these disc, or if you got money there's braking or hope
[2025-03-12T00:22:05] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Do I ruin the maguras if not ?
[2025-03-12T00:22:24] skrtt: Ive seen magura with 2,8mm disks
[2025-03-12T00:24:27] skrtt: Im running the storm hc and they bend too much :/
[2025-03-12T00:27:54] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Tbh I can't find the "stradales" in 90
[2025-03-12T00:27:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Only 100

[2025-03-12T00:32:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: James said coper washers ok
[2025-03-12T00:32:18] skrtt: Im running 90/60 with victor arms wich are different that the thunder ones
[2025-03-12T00:32:58] skrtt: <photos/photo_21965@12-03-2025_00-32-58.jpg>
[2025-03-12T00:33:56] skrtt: Same caliper “holder”, reverse banjo and 100s
[2025-03-12T00:33:59] skrtt: I think u good
[2025-03-12T00:35:11] Paolo ⁭: Yes we have magura with 3mm, but it require mods, you have to do a irreversible mod
[2025-03-12T00:37:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Wait Maybe I installed the wrong
[2025-03-12T00:38:02] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The adapter? Is supposed to go like that or opposite?
[2025-03-12T00:38:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_21967@12-03-2025_00-38-26.jpg>
[2025-03-12T00:38:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like the high side front not rear ?

[2025-03-12T00:39:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Best result I got tire is 35psi
[2025-03-12T00:40:27] skrtt: Can u elaborate on that? Cuz i want to change to sonken 2,8mm disks
[2025-03-12T00:41:28] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is it safe to assume the disk is bent ?
[2025-03-12T00:41:58] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: A bit. even though I think it's hard to bend 2.5mm
[2025-03-12T00:42:18] skrtt: What did i do to stop the noise?
[2025-03-12T00:44:38] skrtt: I still need to solve the problem of the pads not engaging the disc all the way up
[2025-03-12T00:44:45] skrtt: If someone have any ideas please share
[2025-03-12T00:48:03] Paolo ⁭: Ask @Simone_19 he did that

[2025-03-12T01:58:03] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The rings should be also m5 rings yea?
[2025-03-12T01:59:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And for the bleed side the bolt should be enough?
[2025-03-12T02:01:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also do I need to replace that rope looking piece?
[2025-03-12T02:01:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Because this doesn't have it

[2025-03-12T02:18:34] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Probably same price as magura oil ahaha but ok I'll leave Ali for that things
[2025-03-12T02:18:49] skrtt: Ive tested the galfer ones (i forget wich ones) and also the performance, race and green ones from magura
[2025-03-12T02:19:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Pads I'll buy when mine will be close to dying
[2025-03-12T02:19:53] skrtt: I really like race at front and performance in the back. But galfer above all of them

[2025-03-13T11:40:10] Finn: Thats why you need to solder one on
[2025-03-13T11:40:34] Finn: Cut down a usb cable and solder on or connect the cables according to the pinout above
[2025-03-13T11:41:01] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I thought about connecting the Mr directly to the controller

[2025-03-13T15:48:22] Paolo ⁭: Yes I mean it fits of course but no brake should be tight like that, clearance is needed or you will overheat the brake disc
[2025-03-13T15:56:47] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 3mm disc works very very well I've been using it for 2 years with Magura MT5/7
[2025-03-13T15:56:49] Apo: Have u ever seen Motorbike break systems? they are severly tight so much so that they rub while moving the bike itself lol
[2025-03-13T15:56:52] Apo: its fine as is
[2025-03-13T15:57:51] Apo: they have a milimeter or two space here for us thats all it needs, the disc has 80% of its surface free not touching the break pads at all so it got all the room it needs to cool down, the break pads also have plenty of time to cool down :D
[2025-03-13T15:58:07] Apo: i rode my GT above 100km/h the breaks never overheated when breaking hard

[2025-03-14T02:20:42] haku: or stone for the fake rocks you like
[2025-03-14T02:21:15] Noname: Yeah a nozzle is just a hole in metal. The abrasion kills the soft ones. You can print bit shorten life span
[2025-03-14T02:21:46] haku: not with hardened steel nozzles
[2025-03-14T02:21:49] Noname: I wanted to print Flintstones pinewood derby car
[2025-03-14T02:22:00] Noname: Correct
[2025-03-14T02:22:30] Noname: But the diamond is manufactured and not true smooth hole so they say less quality
[2025-03-14T02:22:41] Noname: So hardened steel better
[2025-03-14T02:22:48] Noname: Afaik

[2025-03-14T05:44:30] Yamal: I say this about Colombia because I have a cousin who went on vacation to Colombia, and he told me it was impressive, it only rained at night and during the day, it was a few sunny days and such.
[2025-03-14T05:44:37] Yamal: ^^
[2025-03-14T05:46:19] Yamal: Have a good night, remember that when you are sleeping is when you grow, or at least that's what bodybuilders say.

[2025-03-14T08:02:48] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is 279mm right for 11 inch 90/55.65?
[2025-03-14T09:10:57] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes
[2025-03-14T09:12:16] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <photos/photo_22002@14-03-2025_09-12-16.jpg>
[2025-03-14T09:15:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What is the right psi to pump the tyres are unstable
[2025-03-14T09:31:06] Marius: Are u Sure it was an accident?
[2025-03-14T09:38:38] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I am not good as an example, he inflated them very hard🤣
[2025-03-14T09:38:51] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 3 bar
[2025-03-14T09:56:02] Roby MacGyver: good morning everyone I have a big problem, I installed and configured the brake cut offs to regenerate current since I did it the scooter starts very slowly and gives me all the amps always very gradually, what can I do to solve? this vesc is really difficult to set up,believe me I'm really going crazy, please explain things to me step by step because I'm a newbie
[2025-03-14T09:58:28] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If you disconnect the brake sensors, does this solve the problem or does the same problem persist?
[2025-03-14T10:02:07] Roby MacGyver: I have to try it honestly I haven't thought about it
[2025-03-14T10:02:36] Roby MacGyver: is there anyone who can set a setting to have everything 100%, torque speed acceleration braking?
[2025-03-14T10:12:27] Roby MacGyver: then I explain better what are the parameters that I have to set to have the maximum performance from the start to the end?
[2025-03-14T10:20:13] JPPL: Something arround the tyre to prevent it expand on diameter and a lot of psi then reduce
[2025-03-14T10:20:35] JPPL: You can go up 5bar then reduce to 2/3
[2025-03-14T10:26:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like ratchet strap?
[2025-03-14T10:27:29] JPPL: Yes, or zipties
[2025-03-14T10:27:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And if I already drove 3-5 days with them? Still fixable? (Did couple burnouts too)
[2025-03-14T10:29:13] JPPL: Yes, you must desinflate all now to remove it from the rim, maybe Will get better results after inflating again with high preassure then lower it
[2025-03-14T10:57:47] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <photos/photo_22003@14-03-2025_10-57-47.jpg>
[2025-03-14T11:05:48] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: But this pressure is very high since when we use the scooter the temperature that the tire reaches can rise up to 3.5 bar.
[2025-03-14T11:06:03] Rose: Hey there Baki0546, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2025-03-14T12:38:29] Roby MacGyver: I normally put three ATM in the back and 2.5 ATM in the front

[2025-03-14T16:44:25] haku: ive learned through out the years to exercise your rights. some places like reddit and facebook doesnt like those rights
[2025-03-14T16:45:07] haku: some telegram groups too.

[2025-03-14T17:17:35] Yamal: If you want, we can kidnap him and ask for the ransom.

[2025-03-14T18:18:07] haku: shoot it i dare you. bulletproof up to 9mm
[2025-03-14T18:21:02] Roby MacGyver: ok I'll explain better, I need a setting for the vesc to be able to exploit my engine to the maximum performance, torque speed acceleration,What are the points where I should go to regulate this vesc?
[2025-03-14T18:21:13] haku: this will be mass produced under tesla. prepare your welder Noname
[2025-03-14T18:38:03] Noname: My welder is old and near retirement age
[2025-03-14T18:40:18] haku: i will get us a contract with elon
[2025-03-14T18:42:31] haku: if elon doesnt want it. im sure lockheed or boeing wants it. its a good field recon quiet vehicle that can be parachuted
[2025-03-14T18:54:13] Yamal: Pretty nice your minibike 😍
[2025-03-14T18:54:35] haku: ty. my new pride and joy

[2025-03-14T18:57:28] haku: need to figure out how to get brake mounts. the mt5 will go to this
[2025-03-14T19:16:56] francois schempers: it depends on lots of things, what is your controller, what is your motor, what is your battery capable off, Vesc isn't just one settings to put to the max, and wrong settings can burn things

[2025-03-15T05:04:56] haku: theres the measurements
[2025-03-15T05:32:12] Yamal: Jetson and Haku never fail, they are always ready
[2025-03-15T05:33:00] Yamal: By the way, do you know if the 11" LY motors can be adapted to Fido type bike wheels?
[2025-03-15T09:34:12] Smart Repair: Is there anyone here who has the ability to test an 85250 logic board for proper functionality?
[2025-03-15T09:36:40] Smart Repair: The same MOSFETs have now failed three times, each time at slow speeds and with different motors. Spintend isn't understanding and rules out a defect in the board.
[2025-03-15T10:53:57] SchweigePflicht: Hello, I wanted to ask if the vsett 10 + motor fits in the ninebot g2?
[2025-03-15T11:16:11] 'lekrsu': You need bushings and longer axle shoulder bolts to move the suspension arms to the outside, as the original G2 dropout is 115mm.
[2025-03-15T11:16:45] 'lekrsu': Once moved the dropout becomes a minimum 150mm.
[2025-03-15T11:17:22] SchweigePflicht: How do I do this best
[2025-03-15T11:37:38] GABE: to my eyes 70h was too wide.
[2025-03-15T11:37:45] GABE: I'm pretty sure 60 fits on only one of two axles
[2025-03-15T11:42:51] Yamal: Thank you ⚡️
[2025-03-15T12:18:37] Dualtron Achilleus: Where to buy ferrofluide? any link or recommandation?
[2025-03-15T12:26:19] Roby MacGyver: I would like to have the maximum performance from my engine obviously without burning it and logically if my engine can handle 100 amps I don't give it 200 amps anyway leaving aside the question of maximum power What settings should I touch to have maximum acceleration torque?I'll take care of the watts and amps
[2025-03-15T12:28:13] Roby MacGyver: anyway my engine can handle 100 amps but my battery doesn't give more than 60A
[2025-03-15T12:59:16] francois schempers: it's phase amp, the setting you change for maximum torque, put battery A to something like 50A to be safe, and phase A to what your Vesc can deliver safely, what is it ?
[2025-03-15T13:38:48] Yamal: <photos/photo_22014@15-03-2025_13-38-48.jpg>
[2025-03-15T15:21:34] haku: maybe
[2025-03-15T15:48:14] Roby MacGyver: please can you take a picture of the vesc tool where I have to touch
[2025-03-15T16:50:28] Finn: Anyone know where i can get the beta 6.06 firmware?
[2025-03-15T17:12:04] 'lekrsu': Most will have it packages in the 6.06 app by just updating. Otherwise just compile from Vedders repo's directly.
[2025-03-15T17:12:26] 'lekrsu': App's on the VESC website as usual.
[2025-03-15T17:14:38] haku: hello anyone here?
[2025-03-15T17:18:48] Finn: Building ubox_single_80_no_limits rn
[2025-03-15T17:19:06] 'lekrsu': If you use the terminal is should take a few seconds
[2025-03-15T17:19:24] 'lekrsu': rather than building the very strange QT gui
[2025-03-15T17:19:26] Finn: <photos/photo_22015@15-03-2025_17-19-26.jpg>
[2025-03-15T17:19:28] 'lekrsu': :D
[2025-03-15T17:19:42] 'lekrsu': ubox_single_80, which one is that?
[2025-03-15T17:19:53] Jason: use Linux guys
[2025-03-15T17:19:56] Jason: lol
[2025-03-15T17:19:57] 'lekrsu': Nvm, 150A model I found
[2025-03-15T17:20:02] Jason: or wsl in windows
[2025-03-15T17:20:07] Finn: did
[2025-03-15T17:20:16] Jason: I wonder
[2025-03-15T17:20:25] Jason: when will mp2 get included in repo lmao
[2025-03-15T17:20:31] Jason: (prob never)
[2025-03-15T17:20:33] 'lekrsu': Then you could've just done an update.
[2025-03-15T17:20:59] 'lekrsu': Make a pull request. But MP2 has quite a few revs
[2025-03-15T17:21:05] Finn: first time compiling smth 😩
[2025-03-15T17:21:09] 'lekrsu': Really?
[2025-03-15T17:21:11] Finn: nah
[2025-03-15T17:21:12] Finn: xD
[2025-03-15T17:21:20] 'lekrsu': Go compile Chromium
[2025-03-15T17:21:22] 'lekrsu': see you in a month
[2025-03-15T17:21:27] Finn: no thanks
[2025-03-15T17:21:30] Finn: rather use brave
[2025-03-15T17:21:48] Jason: I tried and bam i didn't get pushed
[2025-03-15T17:21:49] Jason: lol
[2025-03-15T17:21:57] Jason: v0.6
[2025-03-15T17:24:38] haku: anyone know where i can get pegs like these?
[2025-03-15T17:28:41] 'lekrsu': good boy :)
[2025-03-15T17:33:05] haku: these are the fiido motors that can fit i think. I just found this on AliExpress: $277.75 | 12inch Hub Motor LONNYO 2000 4000w 5000w 60mm Dropout 125MM 130MM High Power For FIIDO Electric Scootor Brushless Hub Motor https://a.aliexpress.com/_m03d9xp
[2025-03-15T17:33:52] haku: but there are some qs motors that might fit too
[2025-03-15T17:34:48] haku: not worth for the jeston. battery is tiny.
[2025-03-15T17:36:27] haku: and you dont want a fast jeston. its a deathtrap

[2025-03-15T19:00:37] haku: why do i do this you might ask? well someday when one of you boys get runover by a fiat 500 i will be there to lift it up. it has to be a fiat 500 or no deal
[2025-03-15T19:41:20] Paolo ⁭: 20kg curl😱

[2025-03-15T19:44:59] haku: nice

[2025-03-15T20:27:04] haku: easy. eat alot, lift, creatine 5mg daily. takes time but it will build fast if consistent
[2025-03-15T20:27:35] haku: getting 6pack is a different story though. that one needs strict diet

[2025-03-15T21:08:36] ✨🇪🇸عمر: possible I'm not sure, but I don't use 12v I have nothing connected to my controller

[2025-03-15T21:10:36] Yamal: Maybe you should cut the cable and re-solder everything clean..?
[2025-03-15T21:11:06] ✨🇪🇸عمر: This is what I especially need for the race at the beginning of April 🥲🥲
[2025-03-15T21:11:18] skrtt: This is the dt cable for the “eco turbo” and “single dual”
[2025-03-15T21:12:15] skrtt: I dont really need it but i know if it stops passing current it will be always on single motor
[2025-03-15T21:32:18] Yamal: We'll see if anyone in this group can advise you on how to permanently set it to dual-engine
[2025-03-15T21:40:28] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: You just need to know the wires that go to that button and put them together.
[2025-03-15T21:42:37] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Disassemble the rear button panel in the afternoon and you will see the cables that go to each button. If you join the eco/turbo cables, it will always go in turbo or if you join the dual cables, it will always go in dual.

[2025-03-16T01:08:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Before knowing how to use that powa
[2025-03-16T01:09:10] haku: nice

[2025-03-16T01:17:09] NetworkDir: yea
[2025-03-16T01:29:03] Eren: Overclocked this 350w going 50km with it added a additional battery tho

[2025-03-16T01:40:58] haku: for this badboy! project euro liberation 2!
[2025-03-16T01:55:19] skrtt: Isnt it counterproductive if it spins to much?
[2025-03-16T01:57:30] skrtt: Btw anyone know the peak power of weped sonic s dual?
[2025-03-16T01:57:55] skrtt: My friend swears that its 16kw but i doubt it its true
[2025-03-16T01:59:22] skrtt: <video_file>
[2025-03-16T02:04:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Re phrase your question I didn't understand
[2025-03-16T02:06:24] skrtt: If the tire is spinning to much when u acelerate like going bbbrrrrrrr instead of just rolling normaly
[2025-03-16T02:06:33] skrtt: Isnt that counterproductive
[2025-03-16T02:06:42] skrtt: U dont acelerate as fast i think
[2025-03-16T02:08:48] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Not counterproductive but less productive compared to if I put weight on front but I like the free spin(that video is gps)
[2025-03-16T02:09:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Can do faster just get better tyres and put weight in front
[2025-03-16T02:10:55] skrtt: Even with better tires with such power i think we can never acelerate as fast as “possible” cuz of weight and friction (small width tires)
[2025-03-16T02:11:21] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 11. Going to be 100 rear
[2025-03-16T02:11:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But for now is 90 in both
[2025-03-16T02:12:28] skrtt: Thats why i wanna know the true specs of the weped. Cuz yesterday we were side to side going like 70 and he pressed the throttle and went spinning the tires for like 15s
[2025-03-16T02:12:36] skrtt: That shet is crazy
[2025-03-16T02:13:11] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes I spin at 80too
[2025-03-16T02:13:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 22/3 are scary
[2025-03-16T02:14:59] skrtt: Bro but that weights 180kgs
[2025-03-16T02:15:05] skrtt: Another thing
[2025-03-16T02:16:08] skrtt: Is this true?
[2025-03-16T02:19:00] skrtt: I need the engineers and people that really understand to explain me this one

[2025-03-16T02:38:29] skrtt: Weped owner saying that poweroutput is a lie
[2025-03-16T02:38:59] skrtt: Its stupidly bigger than u think
[2025-03-16T02:55:58] haku: thos motors are not 6.5 scooter motors yea

[2025-03-16T02:59:23] haku: thats crazy power though
[2025-03-16T02:59:29] skrtt: He said they are the same as this video

[2025-03-16T03:05:01] haku: put that thing on a bmx and let it rip
[2025-03-16T03:05:01] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-03-16T03:05:20] skrtt: Peak power of 22kw they say
[2025-03-16T03:05:40] skrtt: And its a 6phase
[2025-03-16T03:05:59] skrtt: <photos/photo_22028@16-03-2025_03-05-59.jpg>

[2025-03-16T03:10:05] Noname: Heard dual phase is a pain
[2025-03-16T03:10:11] haku: that be cool baller build
[2025-03-16T03:10:21] haku: dual 3 phases
[2025-03-16T03:10:37] haku: not 6 phase i think
[2025-03-16T03:10:41] Noname: Yea if they're slightly different it fight itself
[2025-03-16T03:11:07] haku: axiom maybe
[2025-03-16T03:11:35] skrtt: They devide the phases in 2?
[2025-03-16T03:11:37] Noname: Whatever you built it would either rip the tire off or just flip over

[2025-03-16T03:12:43] haku: maybe yea
[2025-03-16T03:12:55] Noname: There's a point where power becomes unusable then completely unusable just adds weight
[2025-03-16T03:15:18] haku: its cool to have all this power on a bike. but you really going to daily this
[2025-03-16T03:19:50] Jason: lol

[2025-03-16T11:30:27] Rose: Hey there Tua mamma, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-03-16T11:41:40] Rose: Hey there Brian, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-03-16T12:54:06] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: For u @Bradhaku
[2025-03-16T13:26:11] Oreo huzky: How tf do you have enugh strength to lift scoot and make dual burnout😭??
[2025-03-16T13:29:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I don't lift it I put my leg infornt so it'll not run away
[2025-03-16T13:33:55] JPPL: Até logoooo! See you later 😝
[2025-03-16T13:35:30] Oreo huzky: But still
[2025-03-16T14:09:09] Dualtron Achilleus: Cst tire
[2025-03-16T14:29:56] Oreo huzky: Ah
[2025-03-16T14:56:07] Patrick: In my opinion it should be tried to redesign the current mp2
[2025-03-16T14:56:32] Patrick: Simple screw terminals like on the seven
[2025-03-16T14:56:52] Patrick: And maybe double sided PCB
[2025-03-16T14:57:14] Patrick: Tolt on the back, busbars on top or back.
[2025-03-16T14:57:57] Patrick: These on the back side and a hole in the pad for the caps so you can place the caps completly on the pcb with minimum leg lenght
[2025-03-16T14:57:58] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Patrick has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-03-16T14:59:42] Yamal: Rose!!!!!
[2025-03-16T15:00:25] Patrick: Tolt mp2 would be amazing could probably be small too
[2025-03-16T15:00:33] Patrick: Even though tolt is expensive it would be worth it
[2025-03-16T15:01:52] Patrick: Dont know much about pcb Design but just from the parts you could make it more compact with tolt then with toll
[2025-03-16T15:02:08] Patrick: Cause double sided pcb would work
[2025-03-16T15:02:34] Jason: naa nearly same size
[2025-03-16T15:03:19] crimeware: You tried? ☺️
[2025-03-16T15:03:44] Patrick: I mean tolt makes double side pcb possible
[2025-03-16T15:03:48] Patrick: Toll not
[2025-03-16T15:04:37] Patrick: Maybe Design one can send you a cad file of the idea with where you could place parts
[2025-03-16T15:05:15] Patrick: Logic stage could be the same? Just little different powerstage cause of tolt right
[2025-03-16T15:06:54] Jason: yea
[2025-03-16T15:07:05] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Shit tyre that's why burnout
[2025-03-16T15:07:09] Jason: tbh id just use IMS and fr4 combo board
[2025-03-16T15:08:31] Patrick: Speak in a language i understand please
[2025-03-16T15:08:37] Patrick: Ims and fr4?🫠😭
[2025-03-16T15:09:22] Dualtron Achilleus: yeah good for no grip^haha
[2025-03-16T15:14:07] Jason: alu board and normal board
[2025-03-16T15:14:38] Jason: tolt kinda fine but too expensive and too rare
[2025-03-16T15:14:55] Jason: fucking even Chinese part selling platform doesn't have it
[2025-03-16T15:15:19] Patrick: But tolt perfect for mp2 to keep it small
[2025-03-16T15:16:41] Jason: how do we even get the parts lmaooo
[2025-03-16T15:19:20] Jason: CUH
[2025-03-16T15:19:21] Patrick: Parts from LCSC and fets from different store
[2025-03-16T15:19:30] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-03-16T15:19:33] Patrick: Damn
[2025-03-16T15:19:35] Jason: lets go fucking 650v
[2025-03-16T15:19:37] Jason: chat
[2025-03-16T15:19:40] Patrick: 650V mp2
[2025-03-16T15:19:52] Jason: lets blow up everything and get electrocuted
[2025-03-16T15:19:54] Patrick: Tesla with vesc
[2025-03-16T15:19:56] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-03-16T15:20:12] Jason: its more likely for SMPS thingy tbh
[2025-03-16T15:20:48] Jason: you know youre fucked when LCSC only returns 1 components
[2025-03-16T15:21:18] Jason: mm, overpriced mosfets
[2025-03-16T15:21:35] Patrick: I mean esc is small then
[2025-03-16T15:21:38] Jason: no much stock also
[2025-03-16T15:21:41] Patrick: And insane cooling
[2025-03-16T15:21:46] Jason: still its too much money\
[2025-03-16T15:21:50] Jason: fucking 5 bucks per mosfet
[2025-03-16T15:22:01] Patrick: xD i mean think about it
[2025-03-16T15:22:06] Patrick: Very powerfull mp2
[2025-03-16T15:22:11] Jason: and theres no 150v ones
[2025-03-16T15:22:15] Jason: i want 150v
[2025-03-16T15:22:20] Jason: i wanna fkn blow up everything
[2025-03-16T15:22:22] Patrick: What Level could you reach from amps small seven?
[2025-03-16T15:22:23] Jason: dc arcs
[2025-03-16T15:22:29] Jason: idk
[2025-03-16T15:22:37] Patrick: 12fet tolt vs 18fet toll?
[2025-03-16T15:22:50] Patrick: 18fet toll no alu pcb
[2025-03-16T15:23:04] Jason: 12fet gonna fit maaaaybe
[2025-03-16T15:23:17] Patrick: I guess would be the same cause the toll has way worse cooling without the alu pcb
[2025-03-16T15:23:26] Patrick: Tolt or toll
[2025-03-16T15:23:32] Jason: hmm
[2025-03-16T15:23:33] Jason: TOLT
[2025-03-16T15:23:46] Jason: i guess lcsc has better
[2025-03-16T15:23:52] Patrick: Yea tolt small but why wouldnt toll work
[2025-03-16T15:23:59] Patrick: Let me explain
[2025-03-16T15:24:16] Jason: Cooling
[2025-03-16T15:24:24] Jason: fkn cooliiiiiiing
[2025-03-16T15:24:28] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-03-16T15:24:58] Jason: you wanna have significantly worse performance Caz of limited cooling? sure go ahead with toll on fr4 board
[2025-03-16T15:26:37] Patrick: <photos/photo_22041@16-03-2025_15-26-37.jpg>
[2025-03-16T15:27:02] Jason: yo gimme some bucks ima buy this mf lmao
[2025-03-16T15:27:16] Patrick: <photos/photo_22043@16-03-2025_15-27-16.jpg>
[2025-03-16T15:27:20] Jason: 150v 297a lmao
[2025-03-16T15:27:22] Patrick: Toll one
[2025-03-16T15:27:35] Patrick: For testing or
[2025-03-16T15:27:39] Jason: for testing ofc
[2025-03-16T15:27:52] Patrick: Wouldnt this work jason i guess you could make 12fet toll very compact too this way
[2025-03-16T15:27:52] Jason: 12fet or 6fet lmao
[2025-03-16T15:28:02] Patrick: And caps on top then like on normal mp2
[2025-03-16T15:28:04] Jason: its what others been doing tbh
[2025-03-16T15:28:17] Jason: thing i hate is capacitor mounting
[2025-03-16T15:28:28] Patrick: You could mount them on top
[2025-03-16T15:28:34] Patrick: Or sideways like on mp2
[2025-03-16T15:28:38] Jason: height sucks
[2025-03-16T15:28:51] Jason: also on IMS quite hard to find space to mount mlcc close to mosfets
[2025-03-16T15:28:55] Patrick: I mean lenght/width are a problem most times
[2025-03-16T15:28:59] Patrick: Caps could fit good
[2025-03-16T15:29:05] Jason: mlcc is problem
[2025-03-16T15:29:09] Patrick: Like maybe 4 caps per side
[2025-03-16T15:29:11] Jason: it cant fit close enugh
[2025-03-16T15:29:27] Jason: best is tolt
[2025-03-16T15:29:44] Patrick: Why
[2025-03-16T15:29:51] Jason: see spintend design
[2025-03-16T15:30:14] Jason: only place you can put mlcc reasonably is between phases but that space gets occupied by connections
[2025-03-16T15:30:25] Jason: which sucks
[2025-03-16T15:31:23] Patrick: <photos/photo_22044@16-03-2025_15-31-23.jpg>
[2025-03-16T15:31:28] Patrick: These parts closer together
[2025-03-16T15:31:48] Jason: still no
[2025-03-16T15:31:57] Patrick: Screw terminals
[2025-03-16T15:32:08] Patrick: Way better then wires and take less space
[2025-03-16T15:32:16] Patrick: + easier to mount
[2025-03-16T15:32:21] Jason: harder to find
[2025-03-16T15:32:36] Patrick: You can make them youreself
[2025-03-16T15:32:41] Jason: naaaaa
[2025-03-16T15:33:13] Jason: I'd just better off spending time contacting China factory in 1688 with translated chinese
[2025-03-16T15:33:25] Jason: making it by myself gonna suck ass
[2025-03-16T15:33:31] Patrick: <photos/photo_22045@16-03-2025_15-33-31.jpg>
[2025-03-16T15:33:44] Jason: no tht
[2025-03-16T15:33:47] Jason: only smd
[2025-03-16T15:33:55] Patrick: Why smd screw terminals
[2025-03-16T15:33:59] Jason: caz ims
[2025-03-16T15:34:07] Jason: ims board = no tht
[2025-03-16T15:34:17] Patrick: Tolt then i guess
[2025-03-16T15:34:29] Patrick: Idk toll sounds like it makes to much problems with design
[2025-03-16T15:34:37] Jason: it is
[2025-03-16T15:34:52] Patrick: For propper cooling alu pcb and this only gives you 1 layer for traces right?
[2025-03-16T15:34:54] Jason: getting restricted to only single layer makes it quite annoying in efficient powerstage design
[2025-03-16T15:35:03] Patrick: + cause of toll not double side possible
[2025-03-16T15:35:04] Jason: ims boards only 1 layer
[2025-03-16T15:35:31] Patrick: Do you know if double sided pcb is expensive on jlcpcb
[2025-03-16T15:35:41] Jason: double sided is cheap aaa
[2025-03-16T15:35:52] Patrick: In mp2 size and this with custom pcb Design with like holes for cables cost extra too?
[2025-03-16T15:35:57] Jason: i ordered 5 sets of my bms test board at 2 bucks
[2025-03-16T15:36:08] Jason: 7 bucks for stencil and fkn 15 bucks for shipping
[2025-03-16T15:36:11] Patrick: Whats the downside less layers?
[2025-03-16T15:36:18] Jason: less layers
[2025-03-16T15:36:21] Jason: lol]
[2025-03-16T15:36:25] Patrick: So pcb wont be much more expensive
[2025-03-16T15:36:32] Jason: not that much expensive
[2025-03-16T15:36:38] Jason: just dont go over 100x100
[2025-03-16T15:36:40] Jason: lol
[2025-03-16T15:36:42] Patrick: But assembly i guess is more expensive cause of double sided pcb?
[2025-03-16T15:36:46] Jason: yep
[2025-03-16T15:36:52] Jason: double sided assembly is expensive
[2025-03-16T15:37:00] Jason: but i can try that tbh
[2025-03-16T15:37:13] Jason: metal fixture inside my oven will prob do it
[2025-03-16T15:37:16] Patrick: Or wait assemble 1 side and only add shunts, busbars & fets to the back side maybe these small caps too
[2025-03-16T15:37:28] Patrick: You would need hotair for the busbars anyways so solder these parts youreself
[2025-03-16T15:37:34] Jason: just
[2025-03-16T15:37:39] Jason: assemble everything inside oven bruh
[2025-03-16T15:37:46] Patrick: No money for oven
[2025-03-16T15:37:47] Jason: why separate
[2025-03-16T15:37:50] Patrick: Hotair cheap
[2025-03-16T15:37:50] Jason: just
[2025-03-16T15:37:57] Jason: buy cheap ass oven in used market
[2025-03-16T15:38:25] Jason: gut the controls and slap on SSR, esp32 and thermocouple
[2025-03-16T15:38:42] Patrick: Wait let me calculate roughly
[2025-03-16T15:38:54] Patrick: Pcb from normal mp2 ~20-25€
[2025-03-16T15:39:07] Patrick: Without fets for other parts ~30€
[2025-03-16T15:39:21] Patrick: So even with tolt kinda fine for the power
[2025-03-16T15:39:49] Patrick: ~120€ maybe for 1 mp2 thwn
[2025-03-16T15:39:49] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Patrick has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-03-16T15:40:28] Jason: atp id just call the esc not mp2
[2025-03-16T15:40:46] Jason: just borrowing the naming scheme at this point
[2025-03-16T15:42:03] Patrick: Yea true call it mp3 xD
[2025-03-16T15:42:08] Patrick: Creative name
[2025-03-16T15:42:25] Jason: lmao
[2025-03-16T15:42:28] Jason: no mop5
[2025-03-16T15:42:30] Jason: mp5
[2025-03-16T15:43:06] Patrick: Mp4
[2025-03-16T15:43:08] Patrick: Like .mp4
[2025-03-16T15:43:15] Jason: https://youtu.be/BkMjoM2z6co?si=CQc6paLUY6-D6Ixc
[2025-03-16T15:43:25] Jason: caz of this lmao
[2025-03-16T15:43:28] Jason: i want to name it mp5
[2025-03-16T15:43:53] Patrick: Lol
[2025-03-16T15:44:17] Jason: for the memes boys
[2025-03-16T15:44:23] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-03-16T15:44:44] Jason: making it is gonna be easier tbh
[2025-03-16T15:45:05] Patrick: Put some stupid pictures on the pcb too make it looks like some crappy diy thing
[2025-03-16T15:45:12] Jason: just copy every logics from my esc and only redo power
[2025-03-16T15:45:23] Jason: i always did when theres space
[2025-03-16T15:45:26] Patrick: Is a powerstage hard to do?
[2025-03-16T15:45:33] Jason: nah
[2025-03-16T15:45:53] Jason: i might try to do miller clamp current sensing
[2025-03-16T15:46:05] Patrick: Would you say kicad is easy? I guess if i take some time i could make powerstages but for logic stage too stupid
[2025-03-16T15:46:10] Jason: maybe
[2025-03-16T15:46:24] Jason: i didnt watch any tutorials and just
[2025-03-16T15:46:24] Jason: did
[2025-03-16T15:46:31] Jason: idk how but it works
[2025-03-16T15:46:40] haku: yes! thats 10/10
[2025-03-16T15:46:51] Patrick: Opened mp2 1 time in kicad and closed it instantly after seing all these layers
[2025-03-16T15:47:03] Jason: lol
[2025-03-16T15:47:05] Jason: its only 2
[2025-03-16T15:47:17] Patrick: I saw 100 things
[2025-03-16T15:47:22] Patrick: Silk screen and stuff
[2025-03-16T15:47:35] Jason: <photos/photo_22046@16-03-2025_15-47-35.jpg>
[2025-03-16T15:47:36] Jason: lol
[2025-03-16T15:47:50] Jason: my laziest job
[2025-03-16T15:48:01] Jason: didnt consider anything
[2025-03-16T15:49:16] Jason: and it did go spicy hot
[2025-03-16T15:49:16] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jason has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-03-16T15:53:13] Yamal: ❤️‍🔥
[2025-03-16T15:56:54] Smart Repair: Anyone have any idea why the front motor goes into negative current? It feels like an anchor is being thrown at the front.
[2025-03-16T15:58:10] Jason: is it 2 different motor?
[2025-03-16T15:58:19] Smart Repair: yes
[2025-03-16T15:58:33] Jason: front one prob has lower KV Value
[2025-03-16T15:58:50] Jason: so it's hitting the point where motor BEMF goes beyond the batt voltage so it regens
[2025-03-16T15:58:51] Smart Repair: rear 70h 30 pole, front stock gt1 40loe
[2025-03-16T15:59:04] Jason: you gotta use overmodulation or field weakening
[2025-03-16T15:59:18] Jason: to at least lessen the regen effect imo
[2025-03-16T15:59:24] Smart Repair: fw is active
[2025-03-16T15:59:41] Jason: moar fwk
[2025-03-16T15:59:44] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-03-16T16:00:11] Smart Repair: 😄 ok, that suits my taste
[2025-03-16T16:00:30] Jason: guess that's too much of a kv difference 😇
[2025-03-16T16:01:04] Smart Repair: It can't be that big. 70h is 22x3
[2025-03-16T16:01:49] Jason: calculate motor kv
[2025-03-16T16:01:56] Jason: both one
[2025-03-16T16:06:50] Smart Repair: How can I roughly calculate this?
[2025-03-16T16:07:07] Jason: https://lekrsu.github.io/kV-calculator/
[2025-03-16T16:07:19] Smart Repair: I think there is no official information about the engines
[2025-03-16T16:07:25] Jason: <photos/photo_22048@16-03-2025_16-07-25.jpg>
[2025-03-16T16:07:38] Jason: full throttle without any field weakening and other things
[2025-03-16T16:07:41] Smart Repair: Thx 🙂
[2025-03-16T16:07:46] Jason: multiply ERPM*pole count for rpm
[2025-03-16T16:08:18] Smart Repair: Perfekt... Thanks
[2025-03-16T16:12:38] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It is the quick return for those who do not understand Spanish
[2025-03-16T16:13:37] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It is on the Jerez circuit in Spain
[2025-03-16T16:17:42] Smart Repair: For 11kW, the acceleration isn't particularly strong. This is a low-kV motor, right?
[2025-03-16T16:36:48] Smart Repair: ok, front 21KV (according to calculator) and rear 29KV

[2025-03-16T17:24:17] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: dual is an old photo of my Nami with the schul-V4 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2025-03-16T17:24:22] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: your photo is with X12 dual motor
[2025-03-16T17:30:15] francois schempers: did à lot on it, you ask chatgpt to make it and you fill up the template with what chatgpt gave you

[2025-03-16T17:58:30] Meli: That’s a Rion, right? Wow, what a monster and how beautiful it is, x12 are crazy
[2025-03-16T18:03:03] Meli: Is that data from Rion???
[2025-03-16T18:03:26] Jan: Then you have the wrong motor kv to behin with
[2025-03-16T18:03:40] Jason: yeah
[2025-03-16T18:03:46] Jason: thats why i shouldve bought 22x3
[2025-03-16T18:03:56] Jan: Higher KV motor but pushing 60A more at the start
[2025-03-16T18:04:31] Jason: someone said 22x3 not that gud for single
[2025-03-16T18:04:39] Jason: 😅

[2025-03-16T18:05:22] Jason: 17x4 dual
[2025-03-16T18:05:27] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-03-16T18:05:27] Jan: 2x 50H > 1x 65H
[2025-03-16T18:05:45] Jason: how bout 1x 65h vs 2x 30h
[2025-03-16T18:05:46] Jason: lol
[2025-03-16T18:05:50] Jan: ^^
[2025-03-16T18:06:07] Jan: Good question
[2025-03-16T18:06:18] Jason: toll fet on fr4 board
[2025-03-16T18:06:19] Jan: Should be around the same stator volume
[2025-03-16T18:06:21] Jason: bad cooling
[2025-03-16T18:06:33] Jason: the 30h motor is ninebot es2 motor lol
[2025-03-16T18:06:41] Jason: 8 inch, "300w"
[2025-03-16T18:06:55] Jan: Meh
[2025-03-16T18:06:55] Jason: it was fun back then when i did put 2 motors in esx and went 70
[2025-03-16T18:07:08] Jason: crazy idea on such smol scoot
[2025-03-16T18:07:27] Jan: I think i would buy two 33x2 stators only and make the rest myself
[2025-03-16T18:07:28] Jason: but thats what brought me to this scene tbh
[2025-03-16T18:07:34] Jason: mmm
[2025-03-16T18:07:36] Jason: nice
[2025-03-16T18:07:50] Jan: I need to make a custom motor myself for another project anyway so i have to learn the design
[2025-03-16T18:08:10] Jan: But how to get stator sheets is a mistery to me
[2025-03-16T18:08:12] Jason: stronk magnets
[2025-03-16T18:08:23] Jason: plate steel?
[2025-03-16T18:08:46] Jan: I would need custom design sheets
[2025-03-16T18:09:04] Jason: yeah
[2025-03-16T18:09:15] Jan: Its kinda a highly magnetic material with electrical insulation in between
[2025-03-16T18:09:18] Franchesco Carofano: X12
[2025-03-16T18:09:27] Jan: Hundreds packed into one block
[2025-03-16T18:09:35] Jan: To mininize eddy currents
[2025-03-16T18:09:42] Jason: did motor have isolation between plates
[2025-03-16T18:09:53] Jason: i only know it has between stator core and coils
[2025-03-16T18:09:54] Meli: That Rion is crazy
[2025-03-16T18:09:59] Jan: Funny how in german we say Whirlcurrents not eddy currents
[2025-03-16T18:10:08] Jason: whirlcurrents
[2025-03-16T18:10:12] Jason: its correct tbh
[2025-03-16T18:10:15] Jason: current go whirl
[2025-03-16T18:10:38] Meli: I guess it will be the Rion noir 100v?
[2025-03-16T18:10:48] Franchesco Carofano: 100v
[2025-03-16T18:10:54] Jason: caz like
[2025-03-16T18:10:54] Jan: That video is so old
[2025-03-16T18:11:05] Jason: ive never seen isolation between core plates
[2025-03-16T18:11:18] Jason: its just all sandwiched together between plates
[2025-03-16T18:11:30] Franchesco Carofano: today
[2025-03-16T18:11:31] Jason: maybe just as some sort of diaelectric coating?
[2025-03-16T18:12:27] Franchesco Carofano: 460ah per face
[2025-03-16T18:13:15] Franchesco Carofano: 28ah 100vol
[2025-03-16T18:16:34] JPPL: Yeah tolt Will BE 4x Faster cooling, but i dont think this Will hot till fail or compromisse riding, maybe on circuito only
[2025-03-16T18:17:37] Jason: wasted potential in any case
[2025-03-16T18:17:48] Jason: couldve been better
[2025-03-16T18:19:27] Jason: not quite powerful, and not high enough to be 30s capable
[2025-03-16T18:19:29] Jason: just
[2025-03-16T18:19:34] Jason: awkward voltage
[2025-03-16T18:19:51] Jason: scary close to

[2025-03-16T18:21:08] JPPL: Dangerous
[2025-03-16T18:22:25] Jason: nop
[2025-03-16T18:22:32] Jason: havent ordered my esc yet lol
[2025-03-16T18:22:47] Jason: yeah same thought
[2025-03-16T18:23:05] Jason: caz low side shunt sees ground potential with smol voltage diff between shunt vdrop
[2025-03-16T18:23:09] Jason: yeah
[2025-03-16T18:23:26] Jason: very weird it just goes nuts
[2025-03-16T18:24:28] Jason: someday if i get enugh money to order then we'll figure it oiut

[2025-03-17T16:35:13] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: to the 3-chul controller to try to put the fw by usb but the pc doesn't recognize it
[2025-03-17T16:35:57] Jason: did you also hook up 5v
[2025-03-17T16:36:12] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes
[2025-03-17T16:36:19] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: For usb
[2025-03-17T16:36:26] Jason: does vesc turn on
[2025-03-17T16:36:33] Jason: lights blinking or etc
[2025-03-17T16:38:57] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If I feed it via USB, I get the same result as feeding 40V and 5V via USB both at the same time, blue light.
[2025-03-17T16:39:31] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: but Vesc toll does not recognize her
[2025-03-17T16:40:46] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If I feed it via USB, the blue light turns on steadily. If I feed it via QS8, the same result is steady blue light.
[2025-03-17T16:40:53] Martin Kaktits: Hey. I finished re-building my scoot. It has g30 dash with lisp, spinny throttle and two vesc. But throttle is very laggy. I have turned down the ramp times in vesc settings, but still. What other reasons there could be that cause laggy tgrottle?
[2025-03-17T16:41:44] Martin Kaktits: I checked adc mapping and its fine. Values are proper and respond with no issues. But driving feels exactly as if it has ramp time still on
[2025-03-17T16:43:44] Jason: try swapping usb d+ and d-
[2025-03-17T16:43:55] Jason: and you using big usb cable right?
[2025-03-17T16:44:03] Jason: rhar plugs into normal usb ports

[2025-03-17T16:49:54] Jason: cp2102?
[2025-03-17T16:49:58] Jason: or some FTDI
[2025-03-17T16:50:23] Jason: those sometimes need drivers to be installed but never seen vesc not getting recognkzed
[2025-03-17T16:50:59] Finn: Yeah some ftdi
[2025-03-17T16:51:05] Finn: Not sur
[2025-03-17T16:51:25] Finn: I also have automatic driver download from windows updates disabled
[2025-03-17T16:51:38] Jason: I never used that shit lol

[2025-03-17T17:01:55] Ev Pro World: You shouldn't have to pay shipping

[2025-03-17T17:02:23] Ev Pro World: August they will ship out by batches
[2025-03-17T17:03:30] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): As you are using opensource parts i would assume you will make the code available?
[2025-03-17T17:06:12] Ev Pro World: Code will never be available for open source
[2025-03-17T17:06:41] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Technically you have to as you are using opensource parts ;)

[2025-03-17T18:14:12] Yamal: Can you imagine that he is a cousin of some Swedish member of the group and we don't know who he is?
[2025-03-17T18:14:18] haku: so dont fuck around and find out
[2025-03-17T18:15:47] haku: hes like proffessor X
[2025-03-17T18:16:55] Yamal: It would be nice if I could call the great BV, in the middle of a route, to turn up the phase and battery A
[2025-03-17T18:17:37] haku: he can if your a good boy. get a neurolink implant. he only conversates using that
[2025-03-17T18:18:08] Yamal: Neurolank

[2025-03-17T18:23:20] Yamal: You have to fall in love with office work
[2025-03-17T18:36:07] haku: i dont feel like deadlifting today yamal. body is beat up but iron will baby. we cant let the demons win
[2025-03-17T18:38:38] Yamal: <video_file>
[2025-03-17T18:51:36] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Heat the entire cone, don't focus on just one part.

[2025-03-17T19:07:36] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: To loosen the cone that acts as a nut, you need a lot of fixing agent; if you don't do it this way, it is almost impossible to remove it.
[2025-03-17T19:22:30] Yamal: Second Round , but I need to stoop for eat
[2025-03-17T20:47:01] Rose: Hey there _ԌӏΛМSҠΞR, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-03-17T20:47:58] Simone: Welcome to the club... I lost 2h to disassemble it despite having used the torch, sector key with 2 meters of lever and heavy hammer
[2025-03-17T20:48:38] Simone: I finally had to cut it to free it...
[2025-03-17T20:54:54] Simone: <photos/photo_22071@17-03-2025_20-54-54.jpg>
[2025-03-17T20:55:53] Simone: I'm almost sure he'd seized the fillet by kneading it down 😏
[2025-03-17T21:00:59] Yamal: the fighting snake
[2025-03-17T21:02:56] Yamal: What type of Vesc controllers do you use?
[2025-03-17T21:19:42] Simone: On this nami I put kelly 7212s (stock motor)
[2025-03-17T21:19:50] Yamal: <photos/photo_22072@17-03-2025_21-19-50.jpg>

[2025-03-17T21:22:38] Yamal: Nice
[2025-03-17T21:24:40] Yamal: Why didn't you decide to ride some glorious Vesc, maybe the Italian custom ones? ^^
[2025-03-17T21:26:30] Simone: it's not mine... I have the task of making the battery and assembling it... Mounting an "important" vesc with stock engines is a waste since you can not push them without risking burning the engines.
[2025-03-17T21:27:43] Simone: The alternative was flipsky, but I don't think they were as "robust" as kelly.
[2025-03-17T21:28:45] Yamal: It is not necessary to mount 3shulc350 either, there are controllers with less power, and you know this better than I do, and always riding the wave is riding the wave
[2025-03-17T21:28:59] Yamal: Flispky no man ! Please
[2025-03-17T21:29:03] Yamal: Free Willy

[2025-03-18T00:12:57] Oreo huzky: Yee
[2025-03-18T00:13:06] Oreo huzky: Yep
[2025-03-18T00:17:39] Yamal: 200a /batt/phase? Let's try our luck one more time
[2025-03-18T00:17:41] Yamal: XD
[2025-03-18T00:21:19] Oreo huzky: Hm why ?
[2025-03-18T00:21:39] Oreo huzky: Ah
[2025-03-18T00:21:41] Yamal: I don’t know man^^’
[2025-03-18T00:21:41] Oreo huzky: Bruh
[2025-03-18T00:21:50] Yamal: So much powar
[2025-03-18T00:21:56] Jason: motor go brrr
[2025-03-18T00:22:28] Jason: someday doing 15kw with 1x 17x4
[2025-03-18T00:22:30] Oreo huzky: Ye motor is right on the edge of stuttering if would weight like 20 kg more it would stutter soo much
[2025-03-18T00:22:31] Jason: no batt rn
[2025-03-18T00:22:34] Yamal: I mean configuration phase A and battery A
[2025-03-18T00:22:40] Oreo huzky: Ah
[2025-03-18T00:23:15] Oreo huzky: I think 230 or 240 phase and 110dc 60fw
[2025-03-18T00:23:28] Oreo huzky: Per Motor
[2025-03-18T00:23:33] Yamal: And battery?
[2025-03-18T00:24:01] Jason: mmm
[2025-03-18T00:24:13] Oreo huzky: 110dc 60fw
[2025-03-18T00:24:15] Jason: I will field weakening for sure on 126v also
[2025-03-18T00:24:19] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-03-18T00:24:30] Jason: should I just put 32s
[2025-03-18T00:24:30] Oreo huzky: 126v and fw 💀💀💀💀
[2025-03-18T00:24:36] Jason: xd
[2025-03-18T00:24:43] Oreo huzky: So you want to go light speed?
[2025-03-18T00:24:46] Jason: I will try to kill the controller
[2025-03-18T00:24:54] Jason: it's 17x4 so not that light speed😇
[2025-03-18T00:24:57] Oreo huzky: Bro wants to go backwards in time
[2025-03-18T00:25:04] Oreo huzky: Ah
[2025-03-18T00:25:22] Jason: so i can give abysmal amount of field weakening and it will go
[2025-03-18T00:25:29] Jason: just too much torque to spare
[2025-03-18T00:25:35] Jason: limited by batt
[2025-03-18T00:25:56] Oreo huzky: Hm with 40pl you should have more then enugh?
[2025-03-18T00:26:24] Jason: problem is no way to get those beautiful cells
[2025-03-18T00:26:43] Oreo huzky: Hm just need to wait a bit
[2025-03-18T00:26:48] Jason: I cant
[2025-03-18T00:26:52] Jason: even if I wait
[2025-03-18T00:27:02] Jason: can't import those cells
[2025-03-18T00:27:05] Jason: 😢
[2025-03-18T00:27:13] Jason: fuck south korea
[2025-03-18T00:27:13] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jason has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-03-18T00:27:17] Martin Kaktits: Any ideas? I think i had this same problem before with fresh firmware but idk what the solution was. What other setting could be responsible for throttle lag
[2025-03-18T00:27:21] Oreo huzky: Ah bruh
[2025-03-18T00:32:44] Jason: I might try to sneakily import
[2025-03-18T00:32:52] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-03-18T01:30:45] Simone: now it's clearer why it doesn't burn anything... try to use 420A phase per engine as I use them 😁😂😂
[2025-03-18T01:33:28] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Bro I'm 64kg I don't need 420a to push me
[2025-03-18T01:33:51] Simone: I'm 70kg...
[2025-03-18T01:52:27] Noname: Always use all the power ya lightweights. I have to pay more for that kind of performance
[2025-03-18T02:23:51] haku: dam lucid almost hit me. too bad i wouldve sued the shit
[2025-03-18T02:24:14] haku: claim i turned autistic because of the accident
[2025-03-18T02:26:37] haku: tactical green cybertruck
[2025-03-18T02:28:17] skrtt: Why? 👌
[2025-03-18T02:31:06] Noname: Misspelt Tacky
[2025-03-18T02:34:34] Noname: <photos/photo_22078@18-03-2025_02-34-34.jpg>
[2025-03-18T02:48:23] haku: agreed. color i dont like. looks like paint from home depot
[2025-03-18T02:48:41] Noname: 1 result was a Martha Stewart color
[2025-03-18T02:49:33] haku: because freedom 😭
[2025-03-18T02:51:12] haku: the best one ive seen is this.
[2025-03-18T02:51:27] haku: lowered and with dirty tires
[2025-03-18T04:25:27] haku: have you seen that tesla on X with a vulcan cannon mounted on the front trunk? i dont have X look it up. badass
[2025-03-18T04:26:37] haku: <photos/photo_22080@18-03-2025_04-26-37.jpg>
[2025-03-18T04:26:37] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-03-18T04:27:48] Noname: Yeah tesla's are not part of my search history
[2025-03-18T04:28:50] Noname: But I did learn how to add a negative and positive part in bambu today
[2025-03-18T04:29:07] haku: dam you. you learning too fast
[2025-03-18T04:29:37] Noname: Made better railing spacers. Shore 85 super soft mmm
[2025-03-18T04:30:00] haku: why need those
[2025-03-18T04:30:42] Noname: Wood rail is smaller than holder. Idk my dad made it work with duct tape
[2025-03-18T04:32:04] Noname: Start with simple projects
[2025-03-18T04:32:22] Noname: He has a buck knife he wanted to make handles for that he never will
[2025-03-18T04:32:25] Noname: That's next
[2025-03-18T04:32:26] haku: i am rectangle lid is as simple as it gets
[2025-03-18T04:32:58] haku: its just the vesc mounting holes measurements. i dont know how to calculate that in
[2025-03-18T04:33:08] haku: knowledge not there yet
[2025-03-18T04:33:25] Noname: Shrink tolerances is a bitch
[2025-03-18T04:33:50] haku: i dont know what that is but yes
[2025-03-18T04:34:17] Noname: Yes you do
[2025-03-18T04:34:26] haku: fillament shrinkage?
[2025-03-18T04:34:30] Noname: When the part cools and shrinks
[2025-03-18T04:34:39] haku: never happens to me.
[2025-03-18T04:34:52] haku: actually it did on overture clear
[2025-03-18T04:35:02] Noname: Those rail spacers shrunk .3mm
[2025-03-18T04:35:07] Noname: Diameter
[2025-03-18T04:35:16] haku: dam
[2025-03-18T04:35:32] Noname: .13 inner sorry
[2025-03-18T04:35:32] haku: resin printer next

[2025-03-18T04:36:05] Noname: But those numbers
[2025-03-18T04:36:07] Noname: 😆
[2025-03-18T04:36:23] Noname: I have bullet proof panel from a bank
[2025-03-18T04:36:31] Noname: Nice shield size
[2025-03-18T04:36:39] haku: get some rest. 8hrs of sleep is recommended for recovery
[2025-03-18T04:36:56] haku: lmao
[2025-03-18T04:37:27] Noname: When the bolt part of my magnet is done I sleep
[2025-03-18T04:37:35] haku: if no sleep your cognitive health will get affected. listen to dr. haku
[2025-03-18T04:38:11] haku: i have a phd in sleep
[2025-03-18T04:38:19] Noname: I could do my job while under anesthesia
[2025-03-18T04:38:54] haku: only way to wake me up is motion sensor alarms
[2025-03-18T04:40:40] Noname: ⏰️ 🚨
[2025-03-18T04:41:52] Noname: FYI printing tpu threads is a terrible idea
[2025-03-18T04:42:35] haku: hey you know those rings you welded? what are they called to hold the boxes?
[2025-03-18T04:42:53] Noname: Split clamp collar
[2025-03-18T04:42:59] haku: gotcha
[2025-03-18T04:43:12] haku: is it easy to make one in cad you think?
[2025-03-18T04:43:35] Noname: You can drill out a half and bolt to it
[2025-03-18T04:43:41] Noname: Em
[2025-03-18T04:43:55] haku: ill look for a stl
[2025-03-18T04:44:01] Noname: Threads need a how to video but not terrible
[2025-03-18T04:44:34] haku: brass inserts would be great use for that part
[2025-03-18T04:47:15] Noname: Ooh there's a company sells hardware etc has the files for parts you can copy
[2025-03-18T04:47:30] Noname: McMaster or somethimg
[2025-03-18T04:47:51] haku: mcmasterbaiter is my guess
[2025-03-18T04:48:03] haku: good company name
[2025-03-18T04:48:32] haku: manager prolly has that north east accent like you eh

[2025-03-18T04:52:08] haku: dam
[2025-03-18T04:53:31] haku: ill look it up.
[2025-03-18T04:54:23] haku: if i will make a rectangular triangle in the triangle part to mount vesc instead of lid 3d version of this would be cool
[2025-03-18T04:54:55] haku: rhomboids or whatever the shape
[2025-03-18T05:04:33] Noname: K done these r cool and useful
[2025-03-18T05:20:15] Yamal: Foc for you
[2025-03-18T05:22:06] Yamal: 😭
[2025-03-18T05:46:17] Jason: lemme slide the high explosive under the battery
[2025-03-18T05:47:03] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-03-18T05:52:09] Noname: @ haku try 3d step file bambu uses that

[2025-03-18T05:55:01] Jason: best website
[2025-03-18T05:58:34] Yamal: When will you visit Weped Cafe and do a live stream for us to see?
[2025-03-18T05:58:43] Jason: idk wheres it

[2025-03-18T07:52:46] Yamal: Where man
[2025-03-18T07:52:52] Yamal: Near Seoul ?

[2025-03-18T10:02:05] Rose: Hey there Michael T, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-03-18T10:14:30] Dualtron Achilleus: 0-60mph spec?
[2025-03-18T10:59:44] Jason: near busan
[2025-03-18T10:59:45] Jason: lol
[2025-03-18T11:01:16] 'lekrsu': Wire adc to vesc. Dash with lisp is laggy.
[2025-03-18T11:21:16] Oreo huzky: 7.5
[2025-03-18T11:25:11] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Or get VESC Bridge V2 ;) No laggy Lisp ... no need to pull extra wires
[2025-03-18T11:25:38] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): (But ... wont work with $h!tsky esc as it has no 12v port and often dont uses standard VESC firmware
[2025-03-18T11:39:05] Dualtron Achilleus: What motor sorry
[2025-03-18T11:45:33] Dualtron Achilleus: Its 60h ok i see on you tiktok
[2025-03-18T11:45:40] Martin Kaktits: I would accept and believe that.. but the thing is : i had this same setup before and somehow aboided the lag, was instant
[2025-03-18T11:45:59] Martin Kaktits: I have ubox + tronic
[2025-03-18T11:46:07] 'lekrsu': CPU at 100%?
[2025-03-18T11:46:20] Martin Kaktits: Mmmm idk. How can i see
[2025-03-18T11:46:28] 'lekrsu': Rt polling somewhere
[2025-03-18T11:46:50] 'lekrsu': Lisp caused lag on my G30 setup, couldn't use.
[2025-03-18T11:46:55] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Well Ubox (spintend) also the 100V ones dont have a 12V port ;) With the others (150, 240, 250 it works)
[2025-03-18T11:47:57] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): <photos/photo_21990@13-03-2025_22-12-12.jpg>
[2025-03-18T11:47:57] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): <photos/photo_22087@18-03-2025_11-47-57.jpg>

[2025-03-18T11:51:42] Martin Kaktits: Actually will have to check this. Could make sense. What are some settings in vesc app that suck up cpu unnecesary perhaps?
[2025-03-18T11:52:08] 'lekrsu': Mostly just LISP scripting.
[2025-03-18T11:53:11] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): You will have a tradeoff always ... you dont want to load the CPU too much but want have reactive scooter ... since the script runs in a loop .... reducing speed of script will add lag to others.
[2025-03-18T11:54:32] Martin Kaktits: Im using bit older script. I checked latest version and it looks more optimized. Perhaps faster BUT i installed it and it does not recognoze throttle at all. Button and siaplay works tho.
[2025-03-18T11:54:58] 'lekrsu': Restart vesc
[2025-03-18T11:55:58] Martin Kaktits: I think i did that 😃 but will give everything another shot today. Very weird. If i didnt know it worked before i would think there is no fix. But i know it can work 😃
[2025-03-18T11:55:59] Martin Kaktits: Ty
[2025-03-18T11:56:07] Martin Kaktits: Will look into it
[2025-03-18T13:15:41] Yamal: <photos/photo_22089@18-03-2025_13-15-41.jpg>
[2025-03-18T13:24:14] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yesterday I fixed a puncture on one of these
[2025-03-18T13:27:11] Yamal: He come with something “” normal for the price later I show everything

[2025-03-18T13:28:22] Yamal: Also can do wheelie
[2025-03-18T13:28:22] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-03-18T13:54:59] Jason: it's bent
[2025-03-18T13:55:13] Jason: damn dats fucked up
[2025-03-18T13:55:26] Jason: patch it up quick or rust will fuck it
[2025-03-18T13:56:37] Jason: taking precious processing time from stm32
[2025-03-18T14:00:35] Yamal: My bebé now
[2025-03-18T14:00:41] Yamal: 🤩
[2025-03-18T14:10:06] Yamal: Slow man^^’
[2025-03-18T14:41:09] 'lekrsu': Your front suspension came pre-broken. Awesome.
[2025-03-18T14:42:25] 'lekrsu': The entire metal rod on yours is bent. Would not drive like that. The fender is not supposed to be remotely close to the chassis there.
[2025-03-18T14:50:57] Yamal: How ?
[2025-03-18T14:51:11] Yamal: I need to drive man
[2025-03-18T14:51:29] Yamal: Where o can buy new
[2025-03-18T14:52:39] Yamal: Like Ali
[2025-03-18T14:52:48] Yamal: Or better to get monorim
[2025-03-18T14:52:48] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-03-18T14:59:04] 'lekrsu': Every original G2 suspension will bend, unfortunately.
[2025-03-18T14:59:33] 'lekrsu': Monorim or Sharkset are two options for it anyway.
[2025-03-18T15:05:53] Yamal: There are in Aliespress ?
[2025-03-18T15:06:20] 'lekrsu': Sharkset no, Monorim yes. But Monorim is cheaper on Amazon usually, for whatever reason.
[2025-03-18T15:06:52] 'lekrsu': Hopefully the G3 suspension, when it's out, can be retrofitted into G2, :D
[2025-03-18T15:12:17] Jason: hope it does but i kinda think they wont
[2025-03-18T15:12:39] 'lekrsu': Any specific reason?
[2025-03-18T15:12:53] Jason: ykno ninebot thing
[2025-03-18T15:13:07] 'lekrsu': G30, G2 and G65 has been the same

[2025-03-18T17:24:37] Yamal: Thanks man 🎩
[2025-03-18T17:24:57] Yamal: what's under the hood
[2025-03-18T17:25:30] Слава Радченко: please tell me what could be the problem
[2025-03-18T17:26:08] Jan: Hall?
[2025-03-18T17:26:42] Слава Радченко: No
[2025-03-18T17:26:56] Jan: Can you spin it by hand first and then accelerate?
[2025-03-18T17:28:21] Jan: Either hallsensor or controller defect or phase short
[2025-03-18T17:28:40] Jan: I had something similar on vsett, roasted controller
[2025-03-18T17:29:44] Слава Радченко: Unfortunately this doesn't help
[2025-03-18T17:32:13] Слава Радченко: I have dual controllers and it doesn't matter which one I connect the controller to, the wheels still do it.
[2025-03-18T17:32:50] Jan: Then its either a phase short or a hall sensor defect
[2025-03-18T17:33:55] Jan: If you can spin it by hand to 5kmh and then the accelerator works, then its hall defect
[2025-03-18T17:34:11] Jan: Else you have a phase short
[2025-03-18T17:34:36] Jan: Eitver change cable or if you fried the winding you can buy a new one
[2025-03-18T17:38:10] 'lekrsu': Have you redone motor detection?
[2025-03-18T18:04:55] Yamal: @roscheeee

[2025-03-18T22:12:05] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Hello friends, could you help me? I made the USB to be able to connect to the PC to install the FW to the 3chul-v4 controller, but vesc does not recognize the controller. I do it through the “SWDprograms” tab. I don't know if I'm doing it right. I checked the USB cable and everything is fine, 5v and data, everything is in place, but I don't know why it doesn't work.
[2025-03-18T22:12:08] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I have 4 controllers waiting to be able to install the fw 😩
[2025-03-18T22:58:35] skrtt: Good ways to clean them without brake cleaner?
[2025-03-18T22:58:43] skrtt: Should i use just water?
[2025-03-18T22:59:18] Dualtron Achilleus: little water better
[2025-03-18T23:00:09] Dualtron Achilleus: little brake cleaner also but dont put on the braking surface
[2025-03-18T23:02:37] skrtt: I dont have brake cleaber
[2025-03-18T23:02:39] skrtt: Cleaner
[2025-03-18T23:03:02] Yamal: I just use water and savon
[2025-03-18T23:03:28] Yamal: After wash must dry ,, finish ,, very good
[2025-03-18T23:06:13] Paolo ⁭: Don't worry us government would start project from 0, they have unlimited funds xd

[2025-03-19T00:44:06] Yamal: Gray Belton is,,?
[2025-03-19T00:44:06] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-03-19T00:44:34] haku: its on hold. gov project first
[2025-03-19T00:44:45] haku: military contracts boys
[2025-03-19T00:50:21] Matthew: I kinda really don't know what I'm doing. I was trying to load updated unlimited firmware and messed up on my phone and now the vesc is bricked. Is there anyway to fix it without st link?
[2025-03-19T01:01:50] 'lekrsu': Bricked firmware needs ST-linking. Some VESCs have dedicated JST ports for it.
[2025-03-19T01:10:32] Matthew: Ok, thank you. I have spintend 85150.
[2025-03-19T01:12:36] 'lekrsu': Your SWD port has exposed ST-Link connections, either directly to an ST-Link V2 or to another VESC 85150, 240/250.
[2025-03-19T01:32:31] Matthew: There was people talking to me when I was doing what I thought was putting the firmware in que. Then I shut my phone off or something and then the power switch just stays yellow now and vesc won't let me connect. While I'm trying to connect I'm able to see a restore configuration and when I click on it the vesc doesn't let it and that's it
[2025-03-19T03:10:43] Matthew: How do you know what is too much field weakening to run?
[2025-03-19T03:20:52] Matthew: Travels to the past (backflip)
[2025-03-19T05:22:58] Yamal: Real project for real boy

[2025-03-19T08:45:22] Yamal: Can’t ? Why
[2025-03-19T08:45:49] Yamal: Vía bluetooth?
[2025-03-19T08:46:49] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I have everything but the PC does not recognize the controller. I checked the cable and everything is fine, as you well know, I have 4 3chul but they are all the same, waiting to be able to install the fw.
[2025-03-19T08:47:38] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If the controller has no information, you cannot connect and when you do, it kicks you out.
[2025-03-19T08:48:04] Yamal: I hope you can install it and get your Nami man back to life.
[2025-03-19T08:48:37] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If no one helps me, I'll buy 5€, burn them, and sell the scooter.

[2025-03-19T08:53:32] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I have spent between €2,500 and €3,000 on controllers. I will not buy any more controllers, and if they are not repairable, I will sell everything.
[2025-03-19T08:55:23] Dualtron Achilleus: Are you sur your usb cable have data and its not only for charing?did you also try to connect via bluethooth?

[2025-03-19T09:03:06] Dualtron Achilleus: What is the message you see when you get kicked put
[2025-03-19T09:03:06] Dualtron Achilleus: Out
[2025-03-19T09:03:40] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Last night I sent a message to @SibClimb to see what I could do or if he could tell me how to do it but he always has a lot of work hehe

[2025-03-19T09:04:11] Yamal: Everything gud and cuality
[2025-03-19T09:04:49] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I will confirm it later, with so many things I don't remember but I think it was BLE...
[2025-03-19T10:10:42] JPPL: Its funny how 3shull dont help? With my makerx g300, i just sendcthen back to repair, free of Charge and send them back to me, all of it was 3 weeks, go and back from China. This is support, the rest are sellers with some knowledge
[2025-03-19T10:12:30] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I've had broken controllers for 3 months now. Someday I'll fix it.
[2025-03-19T10:12:33] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 🤣🤣
[2025-03-19T10:13:38] francois schempers: and what does the st-link tell you when you try to flash à New firmeware
[2025-03-19T10:14:51] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It can't be done with ST or at least that's what they told me the other day when I made the USB cable.
[2025-03-19T10:15:31] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I spend more time waiting for a response than doing what I'm told.
[2025-03-19T10:18:30] francois schempers: it is possible, just inconvenient, instead of pin you can cleanly connect to, you'll have to hold each pin in a hole path and try to make it connect, hold the position while it's flashing
[2025-03-19T10:20:45] JPPL: With this ? <--
[2025-03-19T10:21:58] francois schempers: you can find male male cable, then you have a protruding pin to insert anywhere you need
[2025-03-19T10:23:25] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Need a good 90/65/6.5 tyre for the front If you can find me one on AliExpress I'll appreciate
[2025-03-19T10:28:38] Dualtron Achilleus: Good tire with aliexpress isnt possible haha
[2025-03-19T10:29:02] Dualtron Achilleus: But there are the one with the red line on the they good shape

[2025-03-19T10:50:25] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: where each cable would go I have this model v2
[2025-03-19T11:10:43] francois schempers: @SibClimb you know where to stlink 3shull ?
[2025-03-19T11:14:38] Jason: no connector 2?
[2025-03-19T11:24:52] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <photos/photo_22111@19-03-2025_11-24-52.jpg>
[2025-03-19T11:26:18] Jason: dam
[2025-03-19T11:26:25] Jason: no swd
[2025-03-19T11:30:11] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If there is no route for ST and the USB does not work, I checked the cable before connecting everything was fine, but it seems that it does not work or I am not doing it right.
[2025-03-19T11:35:51] JPPL: @Un_Jason from vesc express on the board, should BE possible to flash from it?
[2025-03-19T11:39:33] JPPL: From uart connection if bootloader is intact, with vesc tools
[2025-03-19T11:39:42] JPPL: But seems it kicks you off
[2025-03-19T11:40:13] JPPL: On the board MCU
[2025-03-19T11:40:20] JPPL: Check datasheet for PIN out
[2025-03-19T11:40:20] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. JPPL has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-03-19T11:40:30] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 🥵
[2025-03-19T11:40:43] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I tried it using Vesc Tool SWD tab
[2025-03-19T11:41:46] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 147258
[2025-03-19T11:44:11] JPPL: That is the last methods, follow MCU traces from pinouts
[2025-03-19T11:44:21] JPPL: It has swd etc...
[2025-03-19T11:45:05] JPPL: Option 1: Flash via UART (VESC Tool or compatible software) On Connector 2: Pins: TX (Pin 23, Green) RX (Pin 21, Yellow) Ground (-) (Pins 12, 14, 18, or 20) 3.3V (Pin 8 or 12) or 5V (Pins 4, 5, 16) (depends on the board's logic level) Steps: 1. Connect a USB-TTL adapter (like FTDI or CP2102): FTDI TX -> RX (Pin 21) FTDI RX -> TX (Pin 23) FTDI GND -> GND (Pin 12, 14, 18, or 20) FTDI VCC -> 3.3V (Pin 8) (make sure the FTDI is set to 3.3V logic level) 2. Use VESC Tool: Connect via serial. If the bootloader is present, you can update the firmware directly through the interface. --- Option 2: Flash via SPI — Using ST-Link or Programmer On Connector 2: SPI Pins identified: NSS (Pin 5) SCK (Pin 7) MOSI (Pin 9) MISO (Pin 11) Ground (-) (Pin 12, 14, 18, or 20) 3.3V (Pin 8 or 12) Theoretically, you could use a programmer (like Raspberry Pi, Bus Pirate, or even an ST-Link in SWIM mode if supported) and flash via SPI. However, SPI bootloaders are not usually enabled by default on STM32 unless customized. --- Option 3: Direct USB On Connector 1: Pins: USB D+ (Pin 1, Purple) USB D- (Pin 3, Brown) Ground (-) (Pin 2) 5V (Pin 4) By connecting a USB cable directly to these pins (taking care of VBUS and GND), you could try entering DFU mode (if the DFU bootloader is active). Useful tools: STM32CubeProgrammer dfu-util (Linux) Note: This USB port is not always configured for DFU; it depends on the firmware installed. --- Summary: --- My recommendation: 1. First, try UART through Connector 2 (TX/RX pins) using a USB-TTL adapter and VESC Tool. 2. If you can’t establish communication, we can try USB (Connector 1). 3. As a last resort, we can look for the SWD pins directly on the MCU to flash using an ST-Link.
[2025-03-19T11:45:27] Jason: yeah
[2025-03-19T11:45:42] Jason: for this you need to enter bootloader mode
[2025-03-19T11:45:43] JPPL: From chatgpt sending board picture and connectores pictures, if better picture it can even maybe detect the traces
[2025-03-19T11:46:56] Jason: @AYO744 what exact esc this is?
[2025-03-19T11:47:04] Jason: 3shul clblabla?

[2025-03-19T11:51:29] Jason: suspected swd
[2025-03-19T11:51:35] JPPL: You think?
[2025-03-19T11:51:54] Jason: yes
[2025-03-19T11:52:07] Jason: 4pin for gnd swdio swclk and 3v3/5v
[2025-03-19T11:52:19] JPPL: Can BE for sure
[2025-03-19T11:52:22] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If I saw these 4 pins
[2025-03-19T11:52:56] Jason: tbh didn't expect to see the pin header soldered on lmao
[2025-03-19T11:53:17] Jason: I expected to just see like 4 pads or 4 empty through hole unpolulatef
[2025-03-19T11:53:27] Jason: not a literal fkn header soldered onto lmao
[2025-03-19T11:53:49] Jason: also kicad moment

[2025-03-19T11:54:16] JPPL: Itvan BE, use multimeter
[2025-03-19T11:54:24] JPPL: For exemple check visible RX or tx
[2025-03-19T11:54:33] JPPL: Can BE uart also
[2025-03-19T11:55:04] JPPL: Then go multimeter from MCU to the pins
[2025-03-19T11:55:11] JPPL: To check if its real swd
[2025-03-19T11:55:12] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. JPPL has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2025-03-19T12:06:44] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Or I check it with the controller powered by USB, right?
[2025-03-19T12:14:53] JPPL: No need to BE on
[2025-03-19T12:15:45] JPPL: With multimeter you Will star from PA14, top right PIN, then Touch the pins on black 4(pins) jason saw
[2025-03-19T12:15:59] JPPL: One off them should have continuity
[2025-03-19T12:16:21] JPPL: Meaning is swclk
[2025-03-19T12:17:21] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: pin 46 and pin 49 must have continuity ok
[2025-03-19T12:17:30] JPPL: ONLY One PIN Will tell US if is swd port then we can use that 4 pins to program
[2025-03-19T12:18:17] JPPL: <photos/photo_22119@19-03-2025_12-18-17.jpg>
[2025-03-19T12:18:20] JPPL: Exemple
[2025-03-19T12:19:15] JPPL: That last PIN from MCU board must have continuity with PIN 2 or 3 from that black 4 pins
[2025-03-19T12:20:11] JPPL: If so, that 4 black pins are swd port
[2025-03-19T12:20:12] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. JPPL has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-03-19T12:24:52] Jason: don't delete that

[2025-03-19T20:00:50] Face de Pin Sucé: It's always complicated, I put 200A phase and 100A battery in this same motor with 21S battery, single motor, so far no problem, but I have a light scooter (speedway leger) and 8.5inch tyres
[2025-03-19T20:01:10] Face de Pin Sucé: And motor is not open, no holes on side covers
[2025-03-19T20:01:44] Basti: Can i send you a dm
[2025-03-19T20:01:49] Face de Pin Sucé: But an important thing, I rephased with 6mm² phase wires
[2025-03-19T20:01:53] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes

[2025-03-19T20:13:00] Matthew: How do you download spintend unlimited firmware for 85150 and then how do you install the firmware. I've bricked my vesc.

[2025-03-19T20:14:34] JPPL: <video_file>
[2025-03-19T20:15:35] Roby MacGyver: no it's wrong this setting is used to have more torque but it doesn't regulate the accelerator
[2025-03-19T20:23:23] Matte: My current one that came with the scooter doesn't want to take more than 120ish, so I've got a motor on the rear that won't lose traction. Only front one does. Would really want to make sure this one packs more punch before thinking of ordering
[2025-03-19T20:24:43] Matte: Did you do it the way ebike guys used to? Only thicker wire to the motor but motor has factory windings?
[2025-03-19T20:26:24] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: less torque less acceleration
[2025-03-19T20:27:29] skrtt: Sneaky smoking browns 🤓

[2025-03-19T21:08:04] Yamal: For example, I wouldn't buy the Stradale, I've had too many punctures with them.
[2025-03-19T21:08:57] skrtt: I have 3k kms and never had a puncture
[2025-03-19T21:09:32] skrtt: Its weird cuz they are the hardest ones

[2025-03-19T21:28:38] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, there is, but I don't have the scooter right now. What I'm telling you is from memory and some information I have on my phone. Let's see if someone can help you with something more specific.
[2025-03-19T21:30:05] Roby MacGyver: Ok thanks I understand
[2025-03-19T21:33:35] JPPL: Maybe, for sure they make some testing ? 😂😂
[2025-03-19T21:36:35] Chefket 52: Oh ok
[2025-03-19T21:37:04] JPPL: All ADC settings are on APP settings in vesc tools
[2025-03-19T21:37:51] JPPL: General, mapping and throthle curve
[2025-03-19T21:38:34] JPPL: Mapping normally is configured by ADC input when configurated, can BE done again, and tunned
[2025-03-19T21:39:05] JPPL: Mapping you can Change some settings to have Faster response from throthle
[2025-03-19T21:39:18] JPPL: Input desabando, low
[2025-03-19T21:39:18] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. JPPL has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-03-19T21:40:36] Chefket 52: Is there another way to connect the light - maybe with a transistor in between or something?
[2025-03-19T21:42:50] JPPL: In general, use filter on, safe start regular, positive ramping time 0.1
[2025-03-19T21:43:08] JPPL: If you have traction Control on Will have lower start
[2025-03-19T21:43:24] JPPL: @ScannellaRoberto hope it helps
[2025-03-19T21:52:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: You want brake light?
[2025-03-19T21:53:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Get step down convertor connect to battery use the brake sensor to switch gnd on and off
[2025-03-19T21:54:28] Chefket 52: Yea
[2025-03-19T21:55:06] Chefket 52: Thanks guys
[2025-03-19T22:03:06] francois schempers: use an adc input board, you'll have a clean brake signal from adc2

[2025-03-19T22:04:38] Chefket 52: But thanks
[2025-03-19T22:08:59] francois schempers: it's quite simple to use and in a small form factor
[2025-03-19T22:10:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: This only for brake light not worth it maybe if u have other uses
[2025-03-19T22:10:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It also dies with 1 short
[2025-03-19T22:11:10] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Why are their stepdowns all shit that die from the smallest thing
[2025-03-19T22:14:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Idk I killed 2 of those and never killed an AliExpress SDc
[2025-03-19T22:17:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The ports of that thing are a recipe for shorts also
[2025-03-19T22:20:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: My advice just get step down from Ali and a set of buttons of u want blinking turn signals get a relay and for brake light just use the sensor to switch it on and off
[2025-03-19T22:20:49] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And use Regen throttle for Regen
[2025-03-19T22:24:41] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Till you want 5V and have a 20S pack ... good luck finding stepdown that wont smoke after 10 minutes (and is small) (Looking at the pile smoked stepdowns next to me 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣)
[2025-03-19T22:27:34] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Yeah i gave up on stepdowns as i needed one for my RF remote to control VESC (on/off) ... i cheated now and used the 5V port of my BMS 😂 And for phone charging found one that at least survives and has even a voltmeter
[2025-03-19T22:32:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I use 12v 5a on a 20s pack
[2025-03-19T22:33:06] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's getting hot if rgbtq led are too bright
[2025-03-19T22:33:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like very hot (ones it stooped working)
[2025-03-19T22:43:49] haku: grampa served with general mcarthur boys. he killed some japs.

[2025-03-20T12:11:01] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2025-03-20T15:32:35] Matte: Do you perhaps accept crypto payment, if I purchase it from you an individual not the company?
[2025-03-20T16:29:37] Yamal: <photos/photo_22152@20-03-2025_16-29-37.jpg>
[2025-03-20T17:42:23] francois schempers: currently working on mine 😁
[2025-03-20T17:42:39] francois schempers: <photos/photo_22153@20-03-2025_17-42-39.jpg>
[2025-03-20T17:43:59] Mirono escooters: Got the new vesc?
[2025-03-20T18:01:41] Jason: @lekrsu just in caze
[2025-03-20T18:01:53] Jason: what do i have to change on rear to fit 65h
[2025-03-20T18:06:32] 'lekrsu': Four longer shoulder bolts and two copper bushings
[2025-03-20T18:07:22] 'lekrsu': Moving suspension axle to outside, and bushing to compensate on other mount as to not bend suspension.
[2025-03-20T18:07:42] Jason: nmmm
[2025-03-20T18:13:22] francois schempers: old one, repaired 👌 new power board 💪
[2025-03-20T18:14:48] francois schempers: you can do that but I wouldn't trust it, long bold aren't supported on both side, so you apply shearing force each time you mount on it, I would advice to support bolt from both side
[2025-03-20T18:36:21] haku: this is actually why im building the bike. not for high speeds but skateparks and burnouts
[2025-03-20T18:37:19] Yamal: Stock fork /// why what
[2025-03-20T18:37:42] haku: no fancy tricks like that yet since ill be having wires and brakes on the handlebars. just ramps
[2025-03-20T18:52:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Hey guys
[2025-03-20T18:52:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is that how much battery I pull at max?
[2025-03-20T18:54:42] Yamal: Phase A
[2025-03-20T18:55:04] Yamal: = 2 motors
[2025-03-20T19:06:23] Marius: amazing 😍😍
[2025-03-20T19:06:45] Marius: i see a lot of 11inch scooters here
[2025-03-20T19:06:50] Marius: what do yall think is the best frame for 11inch?
[2025-03-20T19:08:44] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So I push 350 overall 2 motors (pahse)
[2025-03-20T19:08:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Including fwk amps
[2025-03-20T19:12:16] haku: laotie
[2025-03-20T19:12:42] haku: i have one for sale. just frame
[2025-03-20T19:12:44] Dualtron Achilleus: I guess fw A does count cuz its batterie A
[2025-03-20T19:13:05] Marius: pic?
[2025-03-20T19:13:30] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ok so only way to see that is record ant app when riding
[2025-03-20T19:13:56] Dualtron Achilleus: Or watts power also
[2025-03-20T19:14:05] Dualtron Achilleus: Divide by voltage
[2025-03-20T19:14:06] haku: here
[2025-03-20T19:14:10] haku: its a coat hanger now
[2025-03-20T19:14:36] Dualtron Achilleus: Bms also good yeah
[2025-03-20T19:19:11] francois schempers: I'm planning on mounting monorim with reinforced axle, just not for now, I maxing the stock look right now 😁
[2025-03-20T19:24:48] Marius: too bulky
[2025-03-20T19:24:54] Marius: i like the nami frame kinda
[2025-03-20T19:25:17] haku: expensive nami frame
[2025-03-20T19:25:28] Marius: yeah
[2025-03-20T19:25:30] haku: but looks cool
[2025-03-20T19:25:31] Marius: ill do the g30 anyway first
[2025-03-20T19:25:39] Marius: if i wanna do something else afterwards il see
[2025-03-20T19:25:49] Marius: i really like some of the weped frames but probably impossible to get them
[2025-03-20T19:25:50] Yamal: Stock look really nice …………….
[2025-03-20T19:26:06] Yamal: It’s like sweet candy
[2025-03-20T19:26:11] haku: make one
[2025-03-20T19:26:20] Marius: lol i have no skills in that area
[2025-03-20T19:26:26] Marius: would need ton of research and shit ton of money
[2025-03-20T19:26:37] Marius: 100+ cnc parts probably
[2025-03-20T19:27:02] haku: no need. just need a welder like Noname
[2025-03-20T19:27:27] haku: he will plasma cut the parts
[2025-03-20T19:28:21] Marius: is that as precise as cnc?
[2025-03-20T19:28:48] Noname: One thing I kinda want but never needed
[2025-03-20T19:28:49] haku: no idea. but im sure it cannot be penetrated by a 9mm
[2025-03-20T19:29:10] haku: you dont have one?
[2025-03-20T19:29:20] Noname: It's more for slab steel but it does a damn good job
[2025-03-20T19:29:35] Noname: My friends do
[2025-03-20T19:29:52] Marius: i think the weped frames are just a bunch of cnc parts held together with screws
[2025-03-20T19:29:53] Noname: Look into Droid arc.
[2025-03-20T19:29:57] Marius: at least thats what it looks like
[2025-03-20T19:30:01] haku: grind hard plumbing has a cnc version of plasma cutter
[2025-03-20T19:30:09] Noname: Droid arc
[2025-03-20T19:30:28] haku: oh its called that
[2025-03-20T19:30:57] Noname: I've only ever cut trash trailers and random shit it's hard to be precise by hand. Basically an electric version of gas cutting torch
[2025-03-20T20:02:09] haku: im going to be honest. laotie frame isnt great. maybe shit. no offense to anyone okay. im just trying to get rid of it
[2025-03-20T20:02:44] haku: i have a 20s 10p 40t battery for it though
[2025-03-20T20:03:30] haku: someone offered me 100 for it. but i was greedy and wanted 300 for the frame
[2025-03-20T20:04:34] haku: need to post my stuff om marketplace with proffessional photgraphy to sell em

[2025-03-20T20:08:13] haku: wepoor on hold. gov contracts and family matters atm
[2025-03-20T20:08:19] Pandalgns: Wobbling at 115 kmh 🤪🤪
[2025-03-20T20:08:39] haku: does it? what frame
[2025-03-20T20:08:51] Pandalgns: Halo t107 pro
[2025-03-20T20:08:52] Pandalgns: 😂😂
[2025-03-20T20:09:03] haku: oh laotie frame. i see.
[2025-03-20T20:09:17] haku: yes the rear suspension is the problem
[2025-03-20T20:09:18] Pandalgns: My eggs in my throat
[2025-03-20T20:09:43] haku: those springs always bottom out
[2025-03-20T20:09:45] haku: 125mm
[2025-03-20T20:10:25] Pandalgns: Yes But I have a hard adjusted exa 291
[2025-03-20T20:10:36] Pandalgns: The road was not very good
[2025-03-20T20:10:38] haku: oh wow
[2025-03-20T20:10:45] haku: lemme see how you did it
[2025-03-20T20:10:50] haku: good job dude
[2025-03-20T20:11:25] haku: i might actually keep a seated laotie if springs arw upgradable
[2025-03-20T20:35:31] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It can be caused by several factors: the kg of the tire, the driving position, whether or not you have a steering damper.
[2025-03-20T20:36:52] Pandalgns: 😂😂 I think it was rather the speed ... downstream, bad asphalt, without steering shock absorber, the tire pressure would not tell you no ... I think I know everything 😁
[2025-03-20T20:39:23] Yamal: Geometry?
[2025-03-20T20:40:28] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Posible
[2025-03-20T20:41:18] Marius: 😂😭
[2025-03-20T20:44:10] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: When we have very loose tires when we accelerate the rear part of the scooter bends, so when we brake hard or stop accelerating all that inertia is transferred to the front wheel. If we stop accelerating it continues doing it. What I did was continue accelerating but at the same time braking, but I also realized that it depends on the position of the pilot. I lent the scooter to a friend but he did it at about 120. He never does it to me. We both weigh between 70/75k.
[2025-03-20T20:48:10] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If you do it from the BMS you can know the battery data W-A…
[2025-03-20T20:48:30] Pandalgns: To take speed I am a bit and together with the arms to the body, the same thing of guilt had that since I did not grab the handlebar just as firm that if I go straight, apart, the tires may be a bit low of pressure 😂😂 it is afraid that it will do that to you at those speeds
[2025-03-20T20:57:46] Yamal: Halomonster
[2025-03-20T20:58:26] Yamal: In the end you replaced the damaged esc

[2025-03-20T23:20:54] haku: im not kidding this like 15k photos
[2025-03-20T23:21:19] Yamal: Well, there are photographers who work for a fee, perhaps it's a good way to free themselves a little
[2025-03-20T23:21:24] Yamal: XD

Like there is not enough power. When programming does the board need to be plugged on power board and turned on with the battery?

[2025-03-21T18:38:16] GABE: it's looking like it's gonna look from a factory
[2025-03-21T18:38:43] GABE: Should I place rear motor higher so I can add taller springs later on front?
[2025-03-21T18:39:01] GABE: Would a 1.5cm higher rear cause performance issues for the time being?
[2025-03-21T18:39:02] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-03-21T19:02:46] Yamal: Time to fry

[2025-03-21T19:20:08] GABE: For the holders.
[2025-03-21T19:20:19] GABE: Got a link perhaps pretty please?
[2025-03-21T19:22:36] francois schempers: I used monorim suspension arms, welded two of them together so that the arms is a thick boy, and then just bolted it to the frame, just normal bold and nuts, nothing fancy, three of them on each arm
[2025-03-21T19:25:27] Yamal: …
[2025-03-21T19:32:33] francois schempers: you want to know the worst part ? I had field weakening before every body 😂😂 this was on a xiaomi controller back in the day with xiaogen, I had a faulty controller that was reading, and making wrong foc, I was full throttle the whole time, you can ear it struggling until pouff unregulated field weakening, shot up to 100km/h xD
[2025-03-21T19:38:31] Happy Giraffe: No way!

[2025-03-21T19:59:12] Yamal: We all look forward to your project with real enthusiasm x) :) ^^ ^—^ ^^’
[2025-03-21T20:01:23] 'lekrsu': early fwk testing on ninebot killed so many controllers 😁
[2025-03-21T20:01:32] 'lekrsu': <animation>
[2025-03-21T20:02:21] francois schempers: and it was unintended x) but the controller was beaffy, everything reinforced with hugeass MOSFETs, so it survived xD
[2025-03-21T20:02:25] 'lekrsu': Says who, ;)
[2025-03-21T20:06:51] Yamal: Haku Rider, I hope you didn't fall asleep. You have a lot of work ahead of you with the digitalization of the photos…..

[2025-03-21T20:25:05] Noname: I'm glad I just bought silica beads. My coworker has been throwing these away for years. Just asked me today if I wanted them.

[2025-03-21T20:30:36] Yamal: You must have a motorcycle confessional,,, Every time you say something, it's about buying a motorcycle ^^
[2025-03-21T20:31:33] Noname: Can't pass up an opportunity to buy a money maker
[2025-03-21T20:36:02] Yamal: Every time I leave work I am unable to think about business or making money, it is not ideal because everything in this life is about money but it goes against my nature xD
[2025-03-21T20:37:33] Noname: Coworker was begging me to buy doesn't care if I profit of the deal
[2025-03-21T20:37:50] Noname: I have no desire for a pit bike

[2025-03-22T18:04:06] 'lekrsu': Hey
[2025-03-22T18:11:38] 'lekrsu': Or get any other countersunk screws
[2025-03-22T18:12:48] 'lekrsu': There's no other way we could've formulated it that wouldn't just say the same thing
[2025-03-22T18:22:47] haku: can i be admin. im a good deed person
[2025-03-22T18:27:06] Nawfal: Hey guys
[2025-03-22T18:27:28] Nawfal: Someone can help me about finding a GND ina 84100hp pls
[2025-03-22T18:27:47] Nawfal: I don’t use to talk a lot there
[2025-03-22T18:28:06] Nawfal: This is the vesc
[2025-03-22T18:28:47] Nawfal: Yeah
[2025-03-22T18:29:18] Nawfal: It works if I use the battery one for the turn-off mod?
[2025-03-22T18:30:28] Nawfal: I prefer to have one in the controller
[2025-03-22T18:33:31] Nawfal: The one with the key
[2025-03-22T18:33:47] Nawfal: That is originally done with the 75100
[2025-03-22T18:37:05] haku: good advice. https://youtube.com/shorts/YmALBmqK1HM?si=m7j2qMShPfFebYxW

[2025-03-22T18:39:12] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ) has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-03-22T18:41:08] haku: lol
[2025-03-22T18:41:23] haku: good trip

[2025-03-22T18:41:50] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Yeah back home again already ..... oh fuck this triggers rose ...
[2025-03-22T18:42:16] haku: 5 in a row i think is max. you need to do 4
[2025-03-22T18:42:23] Jason: <photos/photo_22202@22-03-2025_18-42-23.jpg>
[2025-03-22T18:42:27] Jason: why's it running fine
[2025-03-22T18:42:28] Jason: wtf
[2025-03-22T18:42:36] Jason: all wiring harness continuity fine
[2025-03-22T18:42:42] Jason: then WHY
[2025-03-22T18:42:43] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jason has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-03-22T18:42:48] haku: where is yamal!
[2025-03-22T18:42:56] haku: did the feds get you
[2025-03-22T18:43:21] haku: where did you go
[2025-03-22T18:46:50] francois schempers: we are enough admins for now, we can sort of manage the chat alright, but you could be a good candidate if someday we need a bigger team 💪
[2025-03-22T18:47:18] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): 🤣
[2025-03-22T18:49:00] Jason: anyway reached 105km/h
[2025-03-22T18:49:08] Jason: overmodulaton and 20a fwk
[2025-03-22T18:49:17] Jason: only drew about 5k at cruise lmao
[2025-03-22T18:49:37] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Nice! .... check your logs i had issue with OVM + FW .... current was more a ripple .... let me find that picture.
[2025-03-22T18:49:54] Jason: I think it's bms issue
[2025-03-22T18:50:19] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): <photos/photo_22203@22-03-2025_18-50-19.jpg>
[2025-03-22T18:50:30] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): See currents look way different
[2025-03-22T18:50:57] Jason: it is hehe
[2025-03-22T18:51:20] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Ovm introduced noise .... (1.10)
[2025-03-22T18:52:16] Jason: scary ehehe
[2025-03-22T18:52:18] Jason: 114.6
[2025-03-22T19:13:49] Dualtron Achilleus: that's a lot omg
[2025-03-22T19:25:30] Noname: Fixed it, rode it, don't want it but impressive lil hill climber
[2025-03-22T19:52:52] haku: whats the motor
[2025-03-22T19:54:14] haku: no more excuses. today is the day!
[2025-03-22T19:54:14] haku: <photos/photo_22207@22-03-2025_19-54-14.jpg>
[2025-03-22T19:55:12] haku: my free trial expired. and my old save was gone.. i already started this
[2025-03-22T19:55:27] Dualtron Achilleus: what controlor you use for such voltage?
[2025-03-22T20:02:41] puneDir: Why you turned screen to furry thing
[2025-03-22T21:15:33] skrtt: 🫶rain
[2025-03-22T21:23:53] haku: yamal i miss you brother!
[2025-03-22T21:27:17] Matte: I just measured my fork, 115mm :/

[2025-03-22T22:53:05] haku: not sure
[2025-03-22T22:58:00] Noname: What happen he switch to fardriver?
[2025-03-22T23:08:12] haku: maybe demons got him
[2025-03-22T23:52:29] haku: Noname is this you? https://youtube.com/shorts/XVZKWprmjJ8?si=xtmZHMrjTxZC_Kku
[2025-03-23T05:40:34] Jason: wha
[2025-03-23T08:58:47] Rose: Hey there O.​k.​pro, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-03-23T11:16:42] Star / Delta Master: G2 with 65h 16x4 Star / Delta, 16s6p (m58t) and Ubox 85150 0A FWK current 85A battery current 160A phase current
[2025-03-23T11:32:24] francois schempers: someone should make a vesc capable of switching from star to delta on the fly, the guy who make that controller will make good money
[2025-03-23T11:37:51] Mirono escooters: Such a niche thing, I doubt many would be buyers
[2025-03-23T11:38:16] Mirono escooters: Not many have the knowledge to modify motor to star delta switching
[2025-03-23T11:38:38] Mirono escooters: Still cool concept tho
[2025-03-23T11:38:51] 'lekrsu': Every GND is battery ground.
[2025-03-23T11:44:49] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Use a Dual controller? ..... Some lisp would be able to handle that to drive to speed x on ESC1 and then switch to ESC2. Since rewiring in the motor is required anyway you wont escape of using or a switched setup or 2 controllers.
[2025-03-23T11:45:38] Finn: How should that work
[2025-03-23T11:46:13] 'lekrsu': One phase configuration per controller.
[2025-03-23T11:46:15] Finn: You still need a way to switch physically to delta
[2025-03-23T11:46:37] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): 2 controllers ... but means double wiring till esc's
[2025-03-23T11:47:27] Finn: Scematics time😁
[2025-03-23T11:47:36] Finn: Better then discussing
[2025-03-23T11:47:55] 'lekrsu': Mosfet based switching is done industrially. If anyone here understands how that's safely done, then they'd be able to verify or deny.
[2025-03-23T11:47:56] Nawfal: Okay thanks
[2025-03-23T11:48:17] Finn: Called solid state switches/relais
[2025-03-23T11:48:34] 'lekrsu': For high voltage DC, high current
[2025-03-23T11:48:42] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): The lisp part is do-able but aint easy but you can use erpm based and decided on that where you going to send currents to (which esc). When braking you could revert back to ESC1. Wont be easy to make but possible ... surely
[2025-03-23T11:49:07] Finn: Why so complicated😂
[2025-03-23T11:49:27] Finn: Instead of the place of another controller use solid state Relais
[2025-03-23T11:49:41] 'lekrsu': As to not have wall wiring in your fancy scooter 😁
[2025-03-23T11:50:05] Finn: ...
[2025-03-23T11:50:10] 'lekrsu': ;)
[2025-03-23T11:50:24] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Even in a Mosfet switching setupo you still can let the esc do some work in lisp .... erpm 0-xx mosfet not active ... erpm xx-xxx mosfet active .... brake disable mosfet
[2025-03-23T11:50:37] Finn: Sure but whyy
[2025-03-23T11:50:49] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Because you can 😂
[2025-03-23T11:51:04] Finn: Overcomplicating things
[2025-03-23T11:51:12] 'lekrsu': Because it would be a very nice and convenient solution
[2025-03-23T11:51:31] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Yes / No .... its also more idiot proof and you dont have to think about activating a switch.
[2025-03-23T12:00:22] Mirono escooters: Am I the only one here who don't want star delta cuz it's a heap of wires to pull out from motor and stuff to go wrong?
[2025-03-23T12:00:36] Mirono escooters: I'm impressed it's as reliable as it is now
[2025-03-23T12:04:30] Finn: By "physical" i mean wires switching. Either via solid state or relais
[2025-03-23T12:16:19] 'lekrsu': You're not alone in that. I feel the same way. Permanent wiring in Delta is another thing entirely, however.
[2025-03-23T12:39:49] francois schempers: yes exactly, but if someone does it, and sell compatibles motors, and every is handled by his Vesc, I think it will sell well
[2025-03-23T12:57:15] Mirono escooters: But 1 motor doesn't fit all scooters ;)
[2025-03-23T12:57:26] Mirono escooters: It sounds good but I have economic doubts :P
[2025-03-23T13:03:54] francois schempers: maybe for competition then
[2025-03-23T13:41:01] Jason: same
[2025-03-23T14:10:54] Face de Pin Sucé: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNdRLWoEp/
[2025-03-23T14:11:09] Face de Pin Sucé: As always, skills, performance, enjoy ❤️
[2025-03-23T14:21:07] 'lekrsu': Stick to the golden 65H, 17x4 and 22x3
[2025-03-23T14:22:07] Jason: 30s 17x4 is soooo fun
[2025-03-23T14:22:23] Patrick: Small battery and youre fast xD
[2025-03-23T14:22:38] Patrick: Accleration still good i guess?
[2025-03-23T14:22:38] Jason: I want 120x 21700 40pl
[2025-03-23T14:22:42] Jason: insane
[2025-03-23T14:22:47] Patrick: Bruh why
[2025-03-23T14:22:51] Jason: why
[2025-03-23T14:22:52] Jason: not
[2025-03-23T14:22:52] Patrick: Bak 45D enough
[2025-03-23T14:23:05] Patrick: 40PL so much wasted money for you aint gonna lie
[2025-03-23T14:23:06] Jason: or 50pl xd
[2025-03-23T14:23:10] Jason: I want capacity tbh
[2025-03-23T14:23:10] Patrick: XD
[2025-03-23T14:23:16] Patrick: Yes 45D then
[2025-03-23T14:23:24] Patrick: Enough for dual if you ever want it
[2025-03-23T14:23:30] Jason: does 50p exist loo
[2025-03-23T14:23:30] Patrick: + decent capacity
[2025-03-23T14:23:43] Patrick: Nah 40P
[2025-03-23T14:23:47] Patrick: Eve has 50E
[2025-03-23T14:23:47] Jason: hmm
[2025-03-23T14:23:58] Jason: I don't think it's high discharge enough
[2025-03-23T14:24:20] Patrick: 15-20A per cell i think
[2025-03-23T14:24:26] Patrick: Little to weak for you
[2025-03-23T14:24:31] Patrick: Bak45D way to go then good cell
[2025-03-23T14:25:03] Jason: I kinda don't trust bak cells tbh
[2025-03-23T14:25:20] Patrick: Nah not valid
[2025-03-23T14:25:25] Patrick: 45D very good cell
[2025-03-23T14:25:45] Patrick: Better Performance then p45b
[2025-03-23T14:25:51] Jason: hows cycle life
[2025-03-23T14:26:40] Patrick: Little better then p45b as i remember
[2025-03-23T14:27:12] Patrick: Wasnt Bad at all
[2025-03-23T14:27:35] 'lekrsu': Not great cycle life either, comparing Samsung.
[2025-03-23T14:27:55] Jason: hmm
[2025-03-23T14:28:06] Jason: comparing to samsung 50e?
[2025-03-23T14:28:10] 'lekrsu': Yes
[2025-03-23T14:28:13] Patrick: Little better then Samsung 50E
[2025-03-23T14:28:20] 'lekrsu': Heard otherwise.
[2025-03-23T14:28:33] Patrick: Nah check cell tests
[2025-03-23T14:28:34] Jason: mm
[2025-03-23T14:28:46] Patrick: Performance is little better
[2025-03-23T14:29:15] Jason: how better is "little"
[2025-03-23T14:32:20] Patrick: Yea little higher discharge just
[2025-03-23T14:32:25] Patrick: Look at mooch his results

[2025-03-23T22:20:59] haku: or windex
[2025-03-23T22:21:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Soapy water it is
[2025-03-23T22:23:39] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: What do you use it for? Sorry for my ignorance.
[2025-03-23T22:49:27] GABE: honestly 2kw doesnt seem much in motors but like god i realized 2kw is A FUCK TON its literally the power i need to put on a heater

[2025-03-23T23:19:21] haku: use ratchet straps
[2025-03-23T23:20:16] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Don't have
[2025-03-23T23:27:29] haku: use this technique lol
[2025-03-23T23:28:16] haku: or take it to a tire shop with a strong compressor
[2025-03-23T23:48:09] JPPL: For tubeless i use CO2 botles and zips arround tyre
[2025-03-23T23:49:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The zips I have here are shit and CO2 hard to get here
[2025-03-23T23:50:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Manage to pump it but has no fing clue if it's straight
[2025-03-23T23:52:05] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also can fit the magura normally but then the motor won't be center

[2025-03-23T23:56:55] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Next time I think I'll go to a motorcycle shop to put my tyre I have no idea what I'm doing
[2025-03-24T00:05:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: ?
[2025-03-24T00:17:28] haku: comparisson of quality
[2025-03-24T00:17:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I hate fixed rim 😭
[2025-03-24T00:18:43] Matte: Yeah im riding on a M48 pack, pushing 25A peak per cell, dont think it can do more
[2025-03-24T00:21:30] Matte: it is much, free cells tho
[2025-03-24T01:50:37] luffydnoob: Someone knows where I can find original magnachip mosfets MDP10N027
[2025-03-24T02:00:20] luffydnoob: My dualtron Thunder 60v 40a stopped accelerating after adding a 72v battery upon examination I found that 4 of these trash mosfets were blown without any load whataoever just plugging in the battery
[2025-03-24T02:01:12] luffydnoob: Could be that capacitors got burned too ?
[2025-03-24T02:41:43] skrtt: Do u guys think the pmt juniors are good for road driving?
[2025-03-24T02:42:16] skrtt: Like im not going to the track
[2025-03-24T03:04:15] haku: sure.
[2025-03-24T03:04:50] skrtt: Im afraid that im gonna burn them too fast
[2025-03-24T03:05:07] skrtt: Cuz they are 55 shore instead of 65 like stradales
[2025-03-24T03:05:43] skrtt: Should i go junior front and stradale back or the opposite?
[2025-03-24T03:05:51] haku: oh. never had pmt but they are all good ive heard
[2025-03-24T03:06:28] skrtt: Yes they are game changing in terms of grip specially turning
[2025-03-24T03:06:36] haku: pmt junior is 10"
[2025-03-24T03:06:58] skrtt: No is not

[2025-03-24T03:09:13] skrtt: 10,9” after math
[2025-03-24T03:12:32] Noname: My straddles have lasted quite a long time, don't do burnout. More power applied and less life but not bad
[2025-03-24T03:13:21] skrtt: I have stradales currently and they last me 2,5k with some burnouts
[2025-03-24T03:13:37] skrtt: Rear one is almost new
[2025-03-24T03:13:38] Noname: Well that's not terrible

[2025-03-24T17:55:47] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): It will be mounted against an Aluminium plate that gets aircooled.
[2025-03-24T17:56:50] Patrick: How thick
[2025-03-24T17:57:13] Patrick: I guess with shipping 55-60€+?

[2025-03-24T18:06:33] JPPL: Going forward with project, zero with vsett double back suspension
[2025-03-24T18:08:29] JPPL: The ONLY way to check if those pins are what we need, swd, we need to make few tests as told, 1st check if gnd and positive are shorted at MCU(stm32) that is done by check continuity on pins like VSS and VDD, there are a few at the MCU stm32
[2025-03-24T18:10:14] JPPL: 2nd if no shorts and MCU is ok, we advance to check if the 4black pins are swd or not, if yes we can try flash, if not i really dont know, ask the magicians. To do this we need to identify as we already did previous the clk and dio, again check continuity from MCU stm32 PIN to each of the 4 black pins
[2025-03-24T18:10:38] JPPL: We need to identify if this is swd port and to do we must follow this steps
[2025-03-24T18:15:26] skrtt: That damper is diy?
[2025-03-24T18:17:27] skrtt: Saw it on ebay nvm

[2025-03-24T18:31:24] haku: is this legit? 😜 https://youtube.com/shorts/lEVeh2b8Bac?si=4KUHzavKTHdHpq1l
[2025-03-24T18:32:23] JPPL: For sure, i can do that
[2025-03-24T18:32:31] haku: engineering to the fullest
[2025-03-24T18:33:08] haku: i know cad now. im also engineer
[2025-03-24T18:33:28] JPPL: Its Simple, put voltímeter on continuity, touch black and red, check if they ring(piiiiiiii), its ready for test
[2025-03-24T18:34:11] JPPL: We then Touch on MCU stm32 PIN and other at (4black pins)
[2025-03-24T18:34:23] JPPL: <photos/photo_22118@19-03-2025_12-02-23.jpg>
[2025-03-24T18:34:33] JPPL: Nor this two, One at a time
[2025-03-24T18:34:57] JPPL: First One on top, see if any 4 pins make piiiiiiii, otherwise we can stop and i cant help more :(
[2025-03-24T18:34:58] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. JPPL has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-03-24T18:38:39] JPPL: If resistance is 3.4 is low, but not near 0, can BE ok or can BE damage, or its not swd, we need to see other PIN, swdio(3pin on right) and check again continuity on each 4 black pins
[2025-03-24T18:38:45] JPPL: To make more judge
[2025-03-24T18:40:50] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <video_file>

[2025-03-24T18:59:12] haku: its hardened steel isnt it
[2025-03-24T18:59:48] Noname: Stock bends nevermind widened with a bunch of washers
[2025-03-24T19:03:39] Noname: I'm just curious what it's gonna be called?
[2025-03-24T19:11:51] Matte: Any reason to not mount it to that aluminum directly?
[2025-03-24T19:16:12] haku: is copper more heat conductive than aluminum yea?
[2025-03-24T19:23:04] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Well the guy who made them told me during drilling the whole plate heated very easy ;)
[2025-03-24T19:23:24] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Now i can skip heatsinks on the outside as better heatspreading
[2025-03-24T19:23:43] Patrick: Yea much better then alu
[2025-03-24T19:24:36] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I already tried it using the Vesc app and swd programs but it didn't recognize the controller. I did it with an Apple PC.
[2025-03-24T19:34:02] haku: no wonder some cpu coolers are copper

[2025-03-24T21:00:09] JPPL: Meanwhile this time the preassure Will BE near arm, two sides, so Middle Will BE safer ;)
[2025-03-24T21:11:13] haku: what motor is this new or same 70h?
[2025-03-24T21:24:51] Matte: But if he can place them directly on alu that is air cooled, why add an extra layer of copper. I'm missing something clearly so I ask
[2025-03-24T21:28:25] semih yılmaz: Is it durable

[2025-03-24T21:44:34] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Well it has a second purpose ... mounting plate adapter ... now i can use the stock screws where the original esc sits and that holds now the copper plate. And yeah it could have been ALU but friend made it as present for me so i aint complaining :)
[2025-03-24T21:45:18] skrtt: From kwk?
[2025-03-24T21:45:37] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): On my other GT i have them direct on the original alu and had to drill shitload of holes and of course no direct fit ..... gotta love dremel
[2025-03-24T21:51:04] puneDir: Vesc?
[2025-03-24T21:51:58] puneDir: Anyone tested it?
[2025-03-24T22:25:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Was my plan also for the 85240 shame I burnt it 😭
[2025-03-24T22:31:56] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Well i still didnt burn my 150's althoug pushing 10-12Kw in each of them. Anyway swapping to 240 now for the rear motor. Other 240 goes into the other GT just got another motor for that so can be dual again.
[2025-03-24T22:33:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Bro u pushed in 1 more then half of what I push through 2 (17kw)
[2025-03-25T00:03:43] Roby MacGyver: good evening, when the battery is fully charged the electronic brake brakes almost nothing and the engine makes noise , when the battery runs down a little it brakes very well,How can I solve this problem?thanks
[2025-03-25T00:06:48] Roby MacGyver: ahh ok so is it right like this?
[2025-03-25T00:29:59] Jason: you set regen voltage properly
[2025-03-25T00:30:05] Jason: <photos/photo_22238@25-03-2025_00-30-05.jpg>
[2025-03-25T00:30:10] Jason: so it's working as intended
[2025-03-25T00:41:48] Roby MacGyver: yes
[2025-03-25T00:49:22] Roby MacGyver: I have a nominal 52 volt battery, how much should I set?
[2025-03-25T00:50:48] Roby MacGyver: Screenshot (25 mar 2025 00:50:38)
[2025-03-25T00:51:06] Roby MacGyver: is that okay?
[2025-03-25T01:40:02] Matthew: How would you implement this
[2025-03-25T02:11:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Tomorrow I'll check it's 3.11 here
[2025-03-25T02:14:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <video_file>
[2025-03-25T02:33:38] Jason: what's your max charge voltage
[2025-03-25T02:33:58] Jason: I recommend setting the max charge voltage as regen cutoff end and few volts lower as cutoff start
[2025-03-25T02:59:19] haku: where is the 360 mounted
[2025-03-25T03:01:37] haku: i will now prounounce yamal dead or mia. im am sorry fellas we lost a real one. this project is for you buddy! from now on its called operation yamali freedom. 🥲
[2025-03-25T03:02:04] haku: i will continue his big balls legacy
[2025-03-25T04:28:52] Jason: just code
[2025-03-25T04:28:59] Jason: type type type 😜
[2025-03-25T07:00:46] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): <animation>
[2025-03-25T07:02:35] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-03-25T07:23:16] Roby MacGyver: 59volt
[2025-03-25T08:07:43] Jason: mm 14s
[2025-03-25T08:07:46] Jason: 58.8v
[2025-03-25T08:08:01] Jason: set cutoff end to 58.8 and start to wherever you like
[2025-03-25T08:08:07] Jason: about 56~7 imo
[2025-03-25T09:55:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Top stem
[2025-03-25T10:11:15] francois schempers: charge the battery to 90%, when you brake, you need to store kinetic energy somewhere, best bet is the battery, then when battery is full, energy goes into mosfets, and if to much, burn everything ^^ so if you want full braking potential, leave some room on the battery

[2025-03-25T11:20:39] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: very good office 🤣🤣
[2025-03-25T11:22:29] JPPL: There is other option some of US start using: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://github.com/NetworkDir/SimpleVescDisplay&ved=2ahUKEwiy9eG5gaWMAxU4RPEDHTdMNsEQFnoECB8QAQ&sqi=2&usg=AOvVaw2Dfw9B9T3k7GCqSfvNWuBt It uses other screen but possible to import to this u showed
[2025-03-25T11:23:00] JPPL: Rain goneeee no more rainnn it seems!
[2025-03-25T11:48:38] Roby MacGyver: thank you so much to everyone, thanks to this forum I have solved many problems, now at full charge it brakes well and the engine does not make noise
[2025-03-25T11:49:00] Roby MacGyver: 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
[2025-03-25T12:14:29] Roby MacGyver: what I haven't managed to set yet is the start which is smooth and I would like it to be more brutal but perhaps with the engine I have it's not possible,I set the ramp to 0.10s But it changed little
[2025-03-25T12:16:47] Roby MacGyver: I have a 2000 Watt G4 motor I set the vesk to 3000 watts with 57A draw, my battery is 52v nominal Samsung 25ah
[2025-03-25T12:57:27] Martin Kaktits: Ramp can be set to 0. 57A battery or phase? Need max phase for low speed accel
[2025-03-25T13:15:52] Dualtron Achilleus: Are running sensorless?
[2025-03-25T13:16:56] Roby MacGyver: 57 A battery
[2025-03-25T13:17:04] Roby MacGyver: no hall
[2025-03-25T13:17:27] Roby MacGyver: ok I tried it on zero but it changes little and then it gives a jolt every time it accelerates
[2025-03-25T13:26:22] Martin Kaktits: How much phase
[2025-03-25T13:42:59] Roby MacGyver: <photos/photo_22242@25-03-2025_13-42-59.jpg>
[2025-03-25T13:43:17] Roby MacGyver: I also reach 133 phase
[2025-03-25T14:01:21] Roby MacGyver: on this scooter I changed everything, the batteries, the motor, I put the vesk control unit but I can't get it to start in a decisive and powerful way, now it starts like a normal scooter then it accelerates a lot This scooter weighs only 24kg with 11 inch wheels,In my life I have found many scooters for example M4 Pro kugoo from 500w kaboo mantis 800w with the shunt and it started on one wheel
[2025-03-25T14:26:21] GABE: Pfft a 50h G4 motor can easily do more than 3000w
[2025-03-25T14:36:28] puneDir: <photos/photo_22244@25-03-2025_14-36-28.jpg>
[2025-03-25T14:36:32] puneDir: Painted the skirts to matte black
[2025-03-25T14:37:53] puneDir: Now left to r Reinforce the frame Paint white stuff to matte yellow Install the 3kW qs Install the batterys Reinforce the rear swingarm
[2025-03-25T15:00:15] Roby MacGyver: yes
[2025-03-25T15:00:28] GABE: do it then
[2025-03-25T15:02:32] Roby MacGyver: the G4 engine has 3000 watts after 10 km it is already at 82°c in the plain
[2025-03-25T15:04:59] GABE: you're pushing it too hard then
[2025-03-25T15:05:07] GABE: You prob press accel all the time
[2025-03-25T15:05:25] GABE: You can peak 5000 easily
[2025-03-25T15:05:27] Roby MacGyver: the problem is my battery is my BMS more than 57 to not from
[2025-03-25T15:06:09] Roby MacGyver: I should change the BMS and the cells too,the thing is, I thought three thousand watts would be enough for me
[2025-03-25T15:26:47] Rose: Hey there Moi, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-03-25T16:03:27] Roby MacGyver: yes but what comes to mind and say is this is an original 500 watt scooter with a bit of shunt go 1 wheelies and I have to put 5000 watts to get it going on one wheel?
[2025-03-25T16:04:08] JPPL: Vrummm
[2025-03-25T16:04:34] JPPL: <photos/photo_22245@25-03-2025_16-04-34.jpg>
[2025-03-25T16:04:36] haku: is this new motor?
[2025-03-25T16:04:54] JPPL: 70h, i never had it, for speed chace
[2025-03-25T16:05:22] haku: same one installed on this back then but different rim?
[2025-03-25T16:06:08] JPPL: All same, rim, break, disk, tyre
[2025-03-25T16:06:53] haku: i remember your old zero had 70h 33x2 with 12"
[2025-03-25T16:09:07] JPPL: 75h
[2025-03-25T16:09:25] JPPL: True, now back to 11 for rests tests then 12
[2025-03-25T16:10:06] haku: these will have x12s yea?
[2025-03-25T16:11:17] JPPL: Maybe, as it can handle 24s, i Will start with main battery 22s, then maybe add external. So i think i Will stick with x12, with tolt MOSFETs amazing cooling, otherwise g300 or r350
[2025-03-25T16:12:00] haku: always awsome projects coming from you.
[2025-03-25T16:12:18] JPPL: Thanks, always rocking
[2025-03-25T16:51:43] Dualtron Achilleus: Someone have 90h lonnyo 13 inch here?i sax many video of this thing the torque look so insame
[2025-03-25T17:18:46] francois schempers: sensorless doesn't help you either to have the best start possible
[2025-03-25T17:24:48] Dualtron Achilleus: Thats why slow start
[2025-03-25T17:25:34] Roby MacGyver: i have hall sensor
[2025-03-25T17:26:27] Roby MacGyver: I explained myself badly, I have hall sensors
[2025-03-25T17:27:36] Dualtron Achilleus: Foc isnt acting like square wawe also start is slower
[2025-03-25T17:28:38] francois schempers: show me your motor detection screen

[2025-03-25T19:20:50] Roby MacGyver: I don't know if I sent you the right screenshots
[2025-03-25T19:25:26] skrtt: Anyone knows what mods do i have to do to fit 3mm disks on magura mt5?
[2025-03-25T19:34:57] GABE: <photos/photo_22250@25-03-2025_19-34-57.jpg>
[2025-03-25T19:37:14] Apo: lol it wont fit
[2025-03-25T19:37:18] francois schempers: nop ^^ I want result of motor detection wizard
[2025-03-25T19:37:45] Apo: unless u like take out a lot of initial brake pad
[2025-03-25T19:37:56] skrtt: <photos/photo_22251@25-03-2025_19-37-56.jpg>
[2025-03-25T19:37:59] skrtt: <photos/photo_22252@25-03-2025_19-37-59.jpg>
[2025-03-25T19:38:16] skrtt: Not 3mm but 2.8 sorry
[2025-03-25T19:38:53] GABE: No going back.
[2025-03-25T19:38:54] Apo: im using 2.5mm disc from GT2 which ever so slightly fit with almost 0 room to play with so i guess u will have to shave off some brake pad surface
[2025-03-25T19:39:03] JPPL: Oil out, install, oil in
[2025-03-25T19:39:12] Jan: Whats the disc brand again?
[2025-03-25T19:39:19] skrtt: Sonken
[2025-03-25T19:39:57] JPPL: Almost a motor 😂
[2025-03-25T19:40:11] skrtt: Even with the piston all the way back?
[2025-03-25T19:40:23] Apo: yes it fits
[2025-03-25T19:41:01] Apo: <photos/photo_22254@25-03-2025_19-41-01.jpg>
[2025-03-25T19:41:01] Apo: <photos/photo_22255@25-03-2025_19-41-01.jpg>
[2025-03-25T19:41:02] Apo: <photos/photo_22256@25-03-2025_19-41-02.jpg>
[2025-03-25T19:41:22] Apo: brake pads are fully planted back as much as physically possible
[2025-03-25T19:41:36] Apo: so if u wanna fit 2.8mm discs u will have to shave off some surface of the pad
[2025-03-25T19:41:53] skrtt: U get a motor for 70€?
[2025-03-25T19:41:56] Apo: or just drive till it eventually evens out itself :D
[2025-03-25T19:42:03] Apo: but ur brakes might overheat
[2025-03-25T19:42:12] skrtt: 2.7
[2025-03-25T19:42:23] skrtt: I was wrong lol
[2025-03-25T19:42:45] skrtt: Thats a 2,5?
[2025-03-25T19:42:47] Apo: if u push out oil like he said, and then push the pistons back in fully, and then seat everything in, it might work
[2025-03-25T19:42:51] Jan: Too thick, Magura is stressing me already at 2.3mm
[2025-03-25T19:42:59] Apo: yeah GT Disc is 2.5mm
[2025-03-25T19:43:19] Apo: i have no issues with sound, they arent rubbing while driving
[2025-03-25T19:43:39] Apo: i already drove like 60km+ like this
[2025-03-25T19:44:16] skrtt: Kaabo?
[2025-03-25T19:44:21] skrtt: Or segway?
[2025-03-25T19:44:35] Apo: oh sorry, segway GT
[2025-03-25T19:44:54] skrtt: They bend to much
[2025-03-25T19:45:00] Apo: its an Segway Ninebot GT1D changed to VESC and 2x GT1 Motors 72v 20S9P eve40 cells and an ANT BMS with 550A Peak :D 2x 85240 Spintend
[2025-03-25T19:45:10] skrtt: Thats my problem. I have 2,2 atm
[2025-03-25T19:48:16] skrtt: What could be wrong if my pistons are not going all the way back after pressing the lever?
[2025-03-25T19:53:11] Apo: are they dirty? and no they will never go all the way back in
[2025-03-25T19:53:30] Apo: they will always only move sligthly in and out
[2025-03-25T19:54:11] Apo: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/SMUtVhTMPdc
[2025-03-25T19:54:23] Apo: shows how they work (though this one is single sided but u get the point)

[2025-03-26T17:39:43] francois schempers: this as nothing to do with offtopic, and do a bit more effort if you want some help, what screen is it, where did you bought it, what's you're vesc board, if you don't do the effort to give all the info, experts here won't do the effort either, there is a way to change profil from a button press with lisp scripting, or even with an arduino sending signal over, but since I don't know that display, I can't help much, anyway, this topic continue in help where it belongs

[2025-03-26T21:03:10] JPPL: Yes
[2025-03-26T21:03:28] JPPL: I CNA Share what i have to you can try
[2025-03-26T21:17:21] Matthew: So, my newb Dumb ass got into this like exactly 1 year ago. I thermo epoxy my first unit to inside deck. I got another 85150 to go dual motor since single was getting too hot with my usage purposes and epoxy that one in my deck. Fast forward to loving the dual motor setup for the most part. Accelerate and I get a vesc that shorted out on me but my slave vesc was fine and i even had the inline 120amps fuse spintend includes in purchase of vesc..... I for some reason thought these things are bullet proof and won't break down. So slave vesc was fine and I just removed front motor and decided 65h 22x3 Instead of buying another vesc because overall I don't care for dual motor layout. Been wondering why I can't get over 150pa and I thought I was downloading unlimited and closed app mid load and bricked it. I have been using the swd port.
[2025-03-26T21:17:38] Matthew: <photos/photo_22284@26-03-2025_21-17-38.jpg>
[2025-03-26T21:18:02] Matthew: Would you just bolt an 85250 to the side of the inside deck?
[2025-03-26T21:27:39] NetworkDir: yeah

[2025-03-26T22:39:55] haku: need to measure the angles
[2025-03-26T22:44:51] JPPL: For now i was able to add bars of battery level, duty level, red or green signal to detect if tx and RX are well connected (esc detect) and same icon for CAN, able to ready or even write i think. Need more time to test as Im doing step by step. But as Said possible to acess vesc CAN id via uart, i had to split some variablea to avoid Lost connection and need some running to check 100%, meanwhile i add new dutycycle icon, funny hours arround tests last 2 days,
[2025-03-26T22:45:55] JPPL: Able to add touchscren, for exemple half screen or whatever and make action
[2025-03-26T22:46:19] JPPL: Started with just print x on screen to test etc, i can add new Pages, lot of things

[2025-03-27T08:57:17] francois schempers: what was the problem in the first place again ? why you need to stlink ?
[2025-03-27T09:10:02] Roby MacGyver: I saw, but consider that I did 10km all at full throttle with repeated stops and accelerations
[2025-03-27T09:28:19] francois schempers: I saw, just saying, you won't be able to do the same trip in summer

I'm mentioning this for future purchases so that people know the problems that can occur. I don't know how to solve it and I have 4 3chul-v4 controllers.

[2025-03-27T12:44:30] 'lekrsu': You need to press 'read' before writing anything with dual vescs via can. You likely wrote the wrong id to the second vesc, causing it to not be identified.
[2025-03-27T12:44:40] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Damn! That sounds great ... one reason i didnt mount it yet
[2025-03-27T12:45:15] 'lekrsu': What's the sentence really supposed to convey? Don't understand your question at all.
[2025-03-27T12:55:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'd?
[2025-03-27T12:55:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Id
[2025-03-27T12:55:54] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The front does not slip as much as before maybe it's the weather
[2025-03-27T12:56:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The wrong id? Where do I set that up?
[2025-03-27T12:56:54] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: To me it just worked before now I did restore config and no recognize no more
[2025-03-27T12:56:54] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Shlomozero10🇮🇱 has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-03-27T12:56:56] 'lekrsu': Can ID under app I guess. You can also just reset config to detect it again. Then make sure to read every time before writing to not cause this again.
[2025-03-27T12:58:28] Dualtron Achilleus: Something look strange no?😅😅
[2025-03-27T13:00:16] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: How do rest ? (Is it different then restore?)
[2025-03-27T13:00:43] 'lekrsu': Those are synonymous
[2025-03-27T13:00:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_22298@27-03-2025_13-00-57.jpg>
[2025-03-27T13:01:24] 'lekrsu': Restore is from a backup. Reset isn't.
[2025-03-27T13:01:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Whare do I prees rest
[2025-03-27T13:01:55] 'lekrsu': Why's the copper just placed between?
[2025-03-27T13:02:21] 'lekrsu': Detection tab is one place where that option exists.
[2025-03-27T13:02:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like setup motors
[2025-03-27T13:03:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: There it rests adc but I do rest then redo motor detection again because it complaining about over voltage
[2025-03-27T13:04:43] 'lekrsu': Reset, change voltage limits, then detect without reset, then.
[2025-03-27T13:05:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No I do detect press rest then cancel
[2025-03-27T13:05:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Then program ok voltage
[2025-03-27T13:05:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Then redo detect no rest

[2025-03-27T13:50:05] francois schempers: what is your Vesc ?
[2025-03-27T13:51:02] francois schempers: that's normal, a bigger tire means you're leverage is less favorable, but you get higher speed

[2025-03-27T20:13:44] Mirono escooters: Good stuff. Even has a tiny batt for clock keeping
[2025-03-27T20:14:39] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Well i wanted to have smaller gps for my VESC express :)
[2025-03-27T20:19:10] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Within the tool ... or you are STLinking it?
[2025-03-27T20:21:13] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): I have various GPS and all worked ... this small one also would work as it support ublox :)
[2025-03-27T20:23:23] Mirono escooters: Is there difference in gpses? Because I had a 6€ gps and it didn't work with my device So I wonder if this 15€ one will

[2025-03-27T21:08:46] Roby MacGyver: I have a small problem, at maximum speed the engine goes grrrrr,It vibrates a little and makes a little noise and it seems like it wants to pick up the revs but something is holding it back, what could I adjust?
[2025-03-27T21:20:06] francois schempers: same as mine, you should be able to make a switch with an arduino to send the switch commande
[2025-03-27T22:05:57] JPPL: Thanks for sharing, also need One or Thwo, some of them are sharper than other
[2025-03-27T22:13:06] Roby MacGyver: thanks francois, is it not for sale or can someone do it for me?

[2025-03-28T00:38:47] Matthew: I mean can I use it for random cruising 40mph and sometimes a quick burst of speed with statorade in the motor?
[2025-03-28T00:40:42] Matthew: Just curious if I can use them in a more powerful single rwd because I have 4 of them to figure sweet spot to keep settings. But Haku has a battery that's made specifically for this frame and it's 20s 450ab
[2025-03-28T01:29:28] Noname: Why wouldn't it

[2025-03-28T14:08:41] francois schempers: kv is your motor speed per V, you can't change that, and kHz, the higher the quieter your motor runs, but controller will run hotter

[2025-03-28T14:16:34] francois schempers: check if your controller can run at that speed, it's in the specs
[2025-03-28T14:17:32] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If you can't leave your hand on, lower the phase a little.
[2025-03-28T14:18:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Or fwk
[2025-03-28T14:18:17] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes

[2025-03-29T16:08:45] francois schempers: permanent demagnetization of magnets, so it depends on your magnet quality
[2025-03-29T16:09:31] francois schempers: to be safe, don't exceed 100c for prolonged duration, if you don't know what magnet you have
[2025-03-29T16:12:15] Jesús: Nice views

[2025-03-29T16:40:56] yoann tsobanoglou: Redid configuration from start and solved issue. Had also to adjust lisp code which seemed to no recognised a library anymore. But all good. Motors seem a bit more smooth than before. Have to look at screens to compare detection values.
[2025-03-29T16:46:39] francois schempers: please do, rose is missing him ❤️

[2025-03-30T04:19:27] Noname: Worlds fastest is your goal. Drive to ocean and home no charging is my goal

[2025-03-30T04:30:06] haku: almost done. but planning for a v3
[2025-03-30T04:30:46] haku: its just better steel they use. look how thick the dropouts are

[2025-03-30T20:53:28] JPPL: And it should as is crazy high
[2025-03-30T20:55:00] yoann tsobanoglou: Fan works well, consumes 0.09amps on 12v. I think I will power it directly on vesc. Lisp code to turn on once temp is 60. And hopefully will finish printing air intake that will land on the other side. Wasting a lot of time trying to make led act as breathing pattern with vesc express with it changing colour as throttle is applied and changing colour as battery level is when scooter is idle.
[2025-03-30T20:56:50] Face de Pin Sucé: Not that high
[2025-03-30T21:07:24] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Two days driving total Km about 200km driven. 3 GT's all VESC Modified and they have run all with zero issues. (All running Spintend UBOX 85150 with VESC Bridge) Top speeds where we had a chance 110Km.h
[2025-03-30T21:18:11] JPPL: 140 for motor is high, it can damage any motor.
[2025-03-30T21:19:34] yoann tsobanoglou: It’s not, my temp sensors are glued on windings.
[2025-03-30T21:19:34] yoann tsobanoglou: <photos/photo_22371@30-03-2025_21-19-34.jpg>
[2025-03-30T21:19:50] JPPL: A motor that reach more than 150° must BE really good high performance
[2025-03-30T21:20:19] yoann tsobanoglou: If I put on hall pcb it would translate to around 85 compared to 140
[2025-03-30T21:21:36] yoann tsobanoglou: And I have high temp windings (if they really are). Of course those numbers are for testing purposes only.
[2025-03-30T21:21:59] JPPL: So cables get hooter than motor?
[2025-03-30T21:24:54] yoann tsobanoglou: Phase cables during pulls I have not checked. But generally not anything crazy. Motor casing you can touch, but is hot.
[2025-03-30T21:28:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No I'm not the seller
[2025-03-30T21:28:17] yoann tsobanoglou: I changed temp sensor position because stock from lonnyo I found was not accurate. Got scared in the beginning when I saw those numbers, but apparently high temp windings and magnets can withstand 140 easily.

[2025-04-01T00:16:59] Matte: Motor on front makes rough sounds and vibration once it loses traction. I assume if I lower phase amps it won't do that right? I'm assuming observer struggles when spinning out
[2025-04-01T00:55:23] Rose: Hey there Brayan, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-04-01T00:57:19] Jason: LMFAO
[2025-04-01T00:58:03] Jason: I wonder if that's vbatt or smth else
[2025-04-01T00:59:08] Jason: best idea is to use those connector thingy for button
[2025-04-01T01:01:05] Roby MacGyver: this evening I was going at maximum speed and suddenly the wheel blocked, everything turned off and now the vesc it turns on for 2 seconds then sends the BMS to protection and the engine is hard as if braked but if I disconnect the phases it turns freely I used this control unit for 200 km in 1 month powered by 52v and calibrated at 57A 3000 watt so at half its power what could have happened?
[2025-04-01T01:01:33] Jason: blown mosfet
[2025-04-01T01:01:36] Jason: most likely
[2025-04-01T01:08:59] skrtt: Guys i need a new sterring damper. I had mine for like 5k kms and its not good anymore. Can someone link me a good one. Thanks in advance
[2025-04-01T01:11:53] 'lekrsu': Did you use field weakening and triggered BMS protection?
[2025-04-01T01:11:57] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-04-01T01:12:18] Jason: is that what "average" vesc does when bms trip
[2025-04-01T01:12:31] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-04-01T01:12:56] Jason: hmm
[2025-04-01T01:12:58] 'lekrsu': Yes, normally things burn when bemf is uncontrollably captured by mosfets.
[2025-04-01T01:12:58] Jason: that's quite weak
[2025-04-01T01:15:50] Roby MacGyver: no
[2025-04-01T01:16:33] Roby MacGyver: yes but why?
[2025-04-01T01:16:47] Jason: this
[2025-04-01T01:18:29] Roby MacGyver: ok but is it the makerbase that is of poor quality or is it faulty or did I do something wrong?
[2025-04-01T01:21:55] Roby MacGyver: Is the flipsky better or the same?
[2025-04-01T01:22:15] Jason: same or worse
[2025-04-01T01:23:01] Roby MacGyver: even worse?😱😱
[2025-04-01T01:23:23] 'lekrsu': 75100 is very poor quality, yeah.
[2025-04-01T01:23:49] 'lekrsu': Random failures on those models are common.
[2025-04-01T01:24:02] Roby MacGyver: I saw it didn't last long using it at half its power
[2025-04-01T01:24:53] Roby MacGyver: Which control unit do you recommend? Always small and 84v 100A?
[2025-04-01T01:25:51] 'lekrsu': Spintend's Alu models I guess, not a lot of other options at that price range of 100-250€. Makerbase 84100HP otherwise.
[2025-04-01T01:26:50] Roby MacGyver: 100 ok more not ok 🤣🤣
[2025-04-01T01:31:37] Roby MacGyver: not bad this makerbase 84100, it only costs €90, will it have the same plugs? does it also have built-in bluetooth?
[2025-04-01T01:32:08] 'lekrsu': Don't know, haven't tried it. Others spoke well of it though.
[2025-04-01T01:33:20] Roby MacGyver: ok thank you very much I'm going to sleep because in 5 hours I have to go to work, thank you very much for the advice guys
[2025-04-01T01:34:33] 'lekrsu': Spintend's 100/100 still holds up after half a year of use :)
[2025-04-01T01:35:41] Roby MacGyver: ok I will evaluate this one too thanks
[2025-04-01T01:46:45] Matte: Look up MakerX Go-FOC models

[2025-04-01T03:41:52] Роман Фролов: what modifications of vesc did they use? did these models have a built-in gyroscope or not? it is possible to build everything) how much time will it take?
[2025-04-01T03:42:22] Noname: Yes they have gyro or level sensor in them.
[2025-04-01T03:43:18] Noname: You just need a motor, frame with foot plate and battery. I'd imagine it's not super hard to do.
[2025-04-01T03:45:08] Роман Фролов: yes I have donors, and regular 75200, but they don't like external gyroscopes)
[2025-04-01T03:45:29] Noname: The first One wheel was chain drive and looked like someone's grandpa made it 😆
[2025-04-01T03:46:44] Роман Фролов: are there any links to technical solutions from other guys?)
[2025-04-01T03:48:17] Роман Фролов: There is little information in my language segment and I do not speak English perfectly
[2025-04-01T03:49:06] Noname: YouTube has vids
[2025-04-01T03:52:27] Noname: What language?
[2025-04-01T03:52:33] Noname: My scooter Vesc 85/250 has it. Not hooked up to anything.
[2025-04-01T03:56:15] Роман Фролов: I use a bmi160 gyroscope, after initialization in vesc tool it works for a couple of minutes, everything spins, then the controller freezes, I changed the firmware several times, it did not help
[2025-04-01T03:56:51] Роман Фролов: Russian
[2025-04-01T04:24:37] Noname: I asked another chat there was a Russian scooter chat I used to follow

[2025-04-01T06:52:40] Jason: foc>advanced
[2025-04-01T06:52:42] Jason: scroll down
[2025-04-01T06:53:41] Matte: am i blind
[2025-04-01T07:02:44] Jason: is it beta vesctool
[2025-04-01T07:03:05] Matte: probably not, 6.0.5
[2025-04-01T07:03:42] Jason: get beta vesctool
[2025-04-01T07:05:41] Matte: ohh silly me, thanks

[2025-04-01T07:07:24] Matte: yeah i see it now in beta, thanks
[2025-04-01T07:18:46] Roby MacGyver: good morning this vesc can it be repaired? I change the mosfet and it continues to work? why when I connect it to the battery the bms goes into protection? thanks
[2025-04-01T07:19:18] Jason: could be
[2025-04-01T07:20:10] Roby MacGyver: ok do i have to buy the same mosfets?
[2025-04-01T07:20:36] Jason: if you want to
[2025-04-01T07:20:40] Jason: better match it tbh

[2025-04-01T09:07:06] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Using a too high overmodulation + FW can cause "Noise" ..... Good example i had:
[2025-04-01T09:07:35] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): There i had Overmodulation 1.1 ... using now 1.05 and graphs looks like no ovm.
[2025-04-01T10:24:52] Rose: Hey there Dani, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-04-01T10:25:58] Rose: Hey there Dani, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-04-01T10:38:32] Face de Pin Sucé: Thank you
[2025-04-01T10:50:20] Jason: Diamond shaped phase voltage when ovm hehe
[2025-04-01T11:12:22] JPPL: Like c350 being the best, again, Over 140c any motor is not good even with Higher class insolation
[2025-04-01T12:04:19] Face de Pin Sucé: Over 140°C is not efficient, yes that's right But it doesn't damage anything, we have motors 2 years old, being regurlaly heated to 160°C (multiple times per week) and still working like day one As long as the magnets don't reach their maximum temperature, it is fine
[2025-04-01T12:06:01] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, so far, C350 has proven being best even if it has some flaws. RFP himself advices to use C350 after discovering R350 isn't as reliable (yet very powerful) G300 overheats really quick, thanks to it's design Spintend doesn't handle 22S Flipsky, well flipsky
[2025-04-01T12:23:09] 'lekrsu': Lonnyo's 180C windings should minimize damage further.
[2025-04-01T12:52:26] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Yupp did it again 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2025-04-01T12:57:31] Jason: mmm
[2025-04-01T12:57:45] Jason: got it hot to 140c+ and ig it aint problem lol
[2025-04-01T12:58:16] Jason: tbh i should've not been worried caz nb shitmotor hits 130~150c regularly
[2025-04-01T12:59:12] 'lekrsu': What'd you order it with?
[2025-04-01T12:59:26] Jason: all same

[2025-04-01T16:28:57] yoann tsobanoglou: Like @SibClimb said, we have a scooter that was abused daily for 1 year straight and although we expected things to degrade, detection numbers are still similar to day one. Again, motor was opened and we changed temp sensor position to be inside winding.
[2025-04-01T16:53:09] Rose: Hey there Ohad bike, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2025-04-02T00:49:11] Matte: I'm good, put 30A field weakening instead. Can do it now after I installed a steering damper.
[2025-04-02T00:49:30] Jason: hmmm
[2025-04-02T00:51:20] Matte: Gained 20kmh, from 60 to 80. Happy with it
[2025-04-02T00:57:12] Matte: Also reduced max current on front motor from 100 to 70A and now it doesn't shake or vibrate once it spins out. I bet if I looked at the current graph before it would look like a mess bouncing up and down
[2025-04-02T01:00:28] Jason: use traction control
[2025-04-02T01:00:32] Jason: same

[2025-04-02T06:32:06] haku: what motor is this and what temps does this motor has reached and abused if you dont mind me asking?
[2025-04-02T06:48:39] yoann tsobanoglou: Lonnyo first generation 70h 22x3, axle has been adjusted to fit fatter phase wires and added temp sensor. Max was 170~, motor has holes on caps and we have added statorade.
[2025-04-02T07:15:08] haku: thats insane 170c
[2025-04-02T07:15:51] haku: no change in performance at all?
[2025-04-02T07:17:16] haku: when i reach 118c on my 33x2 i already get paranoid
[2025-04-02T08:48:20] yoann tsobanoglou: When temp is reached of course you feel motor doesn’t perform as normal. But as soon as things cool down, it’s back to normal! Again for those who have stock motors, temp sensor is on pcb board so winding temp is a lot higher than the reading you get in the app and not all motors have the high temp windings and magnets options. ( although I feel this is just a marketing bullshit from Lonnyo and they are all the same )
[2025-04-02T08:55:32] yoann tsobanoglou: We had tried to print fans for the motors 6 months ago, but we saw no difference
[2025-04-02T09:55:25] Face de Pin Sucé: I think you did it wrong, we have a very significant difference with and without fan
[2025-04-02T10:10:43] Dualtron Achilleus: Did you also make hole in the motor ?
[2025-04-02T10:11:19] GABE: Fans aren't allowed bro
[2025-04-02T10:12:49] Face de Pin Sucé: Wut ?
[2025-04-02T10:12:51] yoann tsobanoglou: Yes, of course. Motor is Swiss cheese 🧀
[2025-04-02T10:12:58] GABE: kiddin
[2025-04-02T10:24:21] Dualtron Achilleus: Weeped made a lonnyo motor « water cooled » on of this product do the same
[2025-04-02T10:26:44] Dualtron Achilleus: Weeped dark night if i renember well
[2025-04-02T11:02:35] yoann tsobanoglou: I’ve only worked on 1 Weped, ssr or sst. Can’t remember and it had 10inch motors from some other manufacturer.
[2025-04-02T13:35:40] Dualtron Achilleus: This
[2025-04-02T13:36:15] Dualtron Achilleus: Its on weeped dark night standing model

[2025-04-02T16:25:55] GABE: Would a 150a BMS be enough for 300a peaks
[2025-04-02T16:26:05] GABE: hell or even a 100a BMS for 270a peaks
[2025-04-02T17:05:46] Noname: Doesn't vesc die if bms cuts?
[2025-04-02T17:07:41] haku: yea why is that. sometimes it does sometimes it doesnt with spintend
[2025-04-02T17:08:54] haku: living the laotie dream
[2025-04-02T17:11:40] GABE: there's grey, white, red, green, and a big strand of presumibly copper. Which ones are the lines for charge? My other USBC fast charger cable has one big black and one big white and also a smaller blue.
[2025-04-02T17:20:47] GABE: because you can't stop energy on live transformers, that's why electrical site engineers work on live lines.
[2025-04-02T17:34:43] Давно пора: Nice bro! Finnaly
[2025-04-02T17:44:24] Chefket 52: Is it possible to use a cruise control for the script for the g30 in the vesc?
[2025-04-02T18:34:41] haku: i see. thank you for explaining. i always believe you
[2025-04-02T18:37:50] haku: never opened mine. so the temp sensor is on the hall pcb?
[2025-04-02T19:14:31] skrtt: I need to teach her some vesc stuff
[2025-04-02T19:16:14] GABE: it cant be..
[2025-04-02T19:33:42] Matthew: Mine collected connectors for me
[2025-04-02T19:34:00] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): <video_file>
[2025-04-02T19:34:06] Matthew: Collected them and took off with them 🤣🤣
[2025-04-02T19:34:40] skrtt: Hes on to something
[2025-04-02T19:35:07] skrtt: Maybe hes building something faster than your pev
[2025-04-02T19:38:26] Matthew: Did you use statorade with them?
[2025-04-02T19:46:14] Matthew: I read something that sounded like it says the controller can be in a certain part of a phase and land at one point and death and land at other point and all you did have happen is a cut.
[2025-04-02T19:47:07] Matthew: Cause my main vesc died and slave survived. And didn't blow the 120amps fuse either
[2025-04-02T19:51:05] Rose: Hey there Trotin3l, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-04-02T20:13:37] skrtt: The lever is full of oil
[2025-04-02T20:13:40] skrtt: Anyone know what could this be???
[2025-04-02T20:25:05] Matthew: Inside seal is leaking
[2025-04-02T20:25:59] skrtt: So new lever?
[2025-04-02T20:33:56] Matthew: I just replaced the lever on my scooter but I don't know how much they cost you. If really expensive I would like to guess it can be rebuilt. You will also need to have hydraulic oil that's required by manufacturer of the handle and caliper to top off and bleed air out of the system. You must use the oil required by the manufacturer otherwise premature wear or worst is brake failure.
[2025-04-02T20:34:34] Matthew: Mine is zoom handle and caliper on my yume y11
[2025-04-02T21:01:07] skrtt: Im using shimano oil

[2025-04-03T03:05:55] Noname: You would need to start with a small piece of rod and just a lot slower but if it fit in chuck yeah.
[2025-04-03T03:06:32] Noname: Or cut plate drill hole and chuck the bolt, cut into round shape also a way
[2025-04-03T03:08:15] haku: gotcha
[2025-04-03T09:14:52] francois schempers: anyone know where to buy good brake for cheap ? (less than 100€ whole kit) and where to find a cheap front brake adapter for monorim
[2025-04-03T09:55:26] francois schempers: In electronics, “VCC” is a standard label for the main supply voltage (or power rail) that powers the logic circuitry on a board. Historically, “VCC” stood for “Voltage at the Collector” in bipolar transistor circuits, but these days it’s used more generally to refer to the board’s primary operating voltage for microcontrollers and other digital ICs. On your Makerbase MKS ESC board, the “VCC” pin (labeled “5V / 3.3V”) is indicating which voltage level is being used (or provided) for the board’s logic and possibly external devices. Some boards let you select between 5 V or 3.3 V for the logic supply, depending on the components or external modules you’re connecting. Essentially, it’s the rail that feeds power to the microcontroller and other digital components on the ESC.
[2025-04-03T09:59:13] Roby MacGyver: Ok thanks to your explanation it was really effective and complete thank you very much
[2025-04-03T10:01:48] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I have finally sent the controllers for repair. We hope it doesn't take long. ☺️
[2025-04-03T10:09:47] francois schempers: and so, for your throttle and brake, some halls works at 5v some as 3.3v for example

[2025-04-03T10:12:52] Roby MacGyver: yes but for the accelerator and the brake cut-offs there are dedicated wires where 5v 3.3v comes out, and that's why I didn't understand what that switch was for, so from what I understood it's used to power other external things
[2025-04-03T11:20:54] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What model is that?

[2025-04-04T08:32:53] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): A superb and tiny GPS get the BZ121. Reception is amazing much better then any GPS i had and has a high update rate (25hz) and it's super tiny. https://a.aliexpress.com/_EHOk0zS

[2025-04-04T14:14:28] Roby MacGyver: why can't you give 48v or more to the vesc,and to give just a short circuit between dc15 and gnd without voltage you have to put a relay, but if you want to turn on and off only the vesc you don't need a relay, but if you have to turn off everything, so display and lights, you need a relay
[2025-04-04T15:06:50] Noname: It's expensive unless you know a guy.
[2025-04-04T15:08:50] Noname: Powder coating guy lol. Sitting in truck for 9am break
[2025-04-04T15:13:59] Jason: gen10 gps modules are superb

[2025-04-04T15:36:38] Unknown: anyone who builds batteries in europe?
[2025-04-04T15:37:15] Jason: those neo-m6 modules are ancient
[2025-04-04T15:37:25] Jason: slow, less accurate, barely grabs gps
[2025-04-04T15:39:59] Unknown: if anyone is interested in a vsett 10+ motor or a g30D 2 motor dm me (located in denmark)
[2025-04-04T15:43:35] Mirono escooters: Many of us, from where are you?
[2025-04-04T15:45:25] Noname: Looking at qs motors about the same price 24 pole 40h vs 16 pole 45h what difference would pole pairs make?
[2025-04-04T15:46:41] Noname: 40h is 3kw 45h is 5kw.
[2025-04-04T15:46:57] Noname: Obv it's power answered my own ques

[2025-04-04T16:41:12] Mirono escooters: Importing it will cost more then the battery's worth🥹
[2025-04-04T16:41:21] Mirono escooters: I just tagged my (known) EU builders
[2025-04-04T17:06:45] Noname: He's a busy guy and has weird sleeping hours
[2025-04-04T17:37:07] Rose: Hey there CBX, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2025-04-04T21:02:58] Unknown: hi actually im not sure myself i havent measured
[2025-04-04T21:03:03] Unknown: vsett motor sold
[2025-04-04T21:03:31] Matthew: I mean my 85150 showed up. I plugged it in and did setup wizard and rode. Now I can't even connect to the brand new ubox 85250.
[2025-04-04T21:04:06] Matthew: Zero anything has changed in my wiring. Could Bluetooth module be causing this?????
[2025-04-04T21:04:26] Matthew: How do you run setup without Bluetooth?
[2025-04-04T21:05:04] haku: hold ill help in a bit.
[2025-04-04T21:06:02] Matthew: Vsett 10+ motor is 125mm dropout
[2025-04-04T21:06:17] Matthew: Ok, thank you
[2025-04-04T21:14:30] Smart Repair: Stay away from the 85250. There's obviously a problem with it right now. A total of six of them have burned out at low current and some while stationary. Always the same FETs.
[2025-04-04T21:18:05] Smart Repair: Not purchased by you. Directly from Spintend.
[2025-04-04T21:18:29] 'lekrsu': Installed in the same system? Likely other cause generating the failures.
[2025-04-04T21:19:25] Mirono escooters: He's clueless
[2025-04-04T21:19:30] Mirono escooters: Average FB user
[2025-04-04T21:20:12] 'lekrsu': Read threads long enough to know that certain hardware kills everything that's plugged in repeatedly without obvious causes.
[2025-04-04T21:20:12] Smart Repair: No, different systems, 3 different motors. The 85150 runs without problems in the same system.
[2025-04-04T21:22:19] Smart Repair: over 500 A Abs overcurrent error message
[2025-04-04T21:22:47] Smart Repair: a few minutes later 💥
[2025-04-04T21:23:27] Smart Repair: another time in the air at 5 km/h, another time at 20 km/h, etc.
[2025-04-04T21:23:55] Smart Repair: no!
[2025-04-04T21:24:48] Smart Repair: Settings 250A Phase, 375 Abs
[2025-04-04T21:24:49] Smart Repair: <photos/photo_22450@04-04-2025_21-24-49.jpg>
[2025-04-04T21:25:00] Smart Repair: No
[2025-04-04T21:26:06] Smart Repair: Another guy has exactly the same problem. He also has it 3 times 💥 and each time with low current and low speed
[2025-04-04T21:26:51] Smart Repair: each time 85250
[2025-04-04T21:30:09] Smart Repair: ah, and every time the same phase, even though the motor phases were swapped
[2025-04-04T21:30:40] Smart Repair: I can do it tomorrow
[2025-04-04T21:36:14] Smart Repair: once it was hyg, the other times the standard fets
[2025-04-04T21:36:17] Smart Repair: 20s
[2025-04-04T21:40:37] Smart Repair: 5 km/h, 20% throttle 💥. In the air, 2x in quick succession, 10% throttle 💥. The other guy reported that it happened at low speed without accelerating hard. So, like me.
[2025-04-04T21:41:43] Smart Repair: 70h 22x3, stock GT1, stock GT2. All three have the same problem.
[2025-04-04T21:44:26] Smart Repair: no, never
[2025-04-04T21:46:54] Smart Repair: It's strange to me, too. At first, I thought it was my fault. After it happened three times and I heard the same thing from another guy, I think there must be a problem with the 250. During the transition period, I reinstalled the 150 and never had any problems. The system has also been running with the x12 for several weeks now.
[2025-04-04T21:47:58] Smart Repair: I can send it to you tomorrow. Luckily, I made a backup and logged the last trip.
[2025-04-04T21:55:57] Smart Repair: I won't bother with it anymore. I've bought many uboxes and never filed a complaint. I also took delivery of the three FET boards. Spintend goodwill and warranty are a disaster. I'll send the 250 back, and after that, I'm done with Spintend 🤷‍♂️ The 250cc has now cost me just under €500, not including time and stress. Crazy
[2025-04-04T22:17:05] Rose: Hey there Dani, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-04-04T22:20:38] Smart Repair: Yes, I have 1 logic board and 3 FET boards. The other type is exactly the same.
[2025-04-04T22:26:29] 'lekrsu': Hi, anyone managed to script with lisp, a profile switcher based on adc1/adc2 combinations? Thanks
[2025-04-04T23:24:40] skrtt: Is this normal?
[2025-04-04T23:41:12] Smart Repair: That's exactly my guess.
[2025-04-05T02:21:06] haku: sorry im back. did someone solve your issue?
[2025-04-05T02:23:41] haku: thats prolly whats happening to me
[2025-04-05T02:24:08] haku: 3 pawerstages 2 same boards
[2025-04-05T02:38:37] haku: now im scared to even rebuild it

[2025-04-05T02:55:42] Applez Ontop: it’s not charging
[2025-04-05T02:55:52] Applez Ontop: been plugged in for past 2 hours doesn’t turn in
[2025-04-05T02:55:59] Applez Ontop: gonna try the multimeter
[2025-04-05T03:14:39] haku: no idea. ive only killed 12fets never 6fets
[2025-04-05T03:15:19] haku: china forcing my hand to buy american.

[2025-04-05T04:50:56] haku: even the busses have sinks
[2025-04-05T04:51:05] Matte: Do we know if that's enough wires?
[2025-04-05T04:51:09] haku: very innovative fella
[2025-04-05T04:54:27] Matthew: So. I ended up learning more on the pc app and used USB. It's all programmed and waiting for a test ride tomorrow as it's 9pm and rain/snow rn.
[2025-04-05T04:54:54] haku: good man
[2025-04-05T04:57:25] Matte: Hahaha
[2025-04-05T04:57:52] Matte: I'm allergic to people full of themselves writing nonsense but present themselves as an expert
[2025-04-05T04:57:59] Matte: You have to be special to do so
[2025-04-05T04:59:14] haku: as a historian/engineer i totaly agree
[2025-04-05T05:06:38] Matthew: I'm going to order another Bluetooth module to try and see if maybe what I have is coincidentally bad. But, when I was trying to carefully pull the Bluetooth module connector out of the vesc the receptacle came out. I removed it from the connector and shoved it back it but now I'm worried it's going to be an issue..... or can I put the smallest dab ever of epoxy to the sides of the receptacle to keep it in place?????
[2025-04-05T05:07:06] haku: his motor looks like 100h though
[2025-04-05T05:08:32] haku: let me join that group make a shit post worlds fastest ebike
[2025-04-05T05:09:30] Matthew: For my 85150. How would I get in it to unbrick it? I have the USB and laptop available. I also have an st-link but didn't have any luck with that in very recent past, which is why I now have this 85250.... I have my 65h 17x4 I intend on using on my scooter and my 85150 should run it fine. I'm wanting that 85250 for my yume scooter.
[2025-04-05T05:10:26] haku: open it and bend the tabs straight. that happened to me too. the jst sometimes loose
[2025-04-05T05:10:49] haku: use plastic thingy to bend it straight
[2025-04-05T05:11:45] haku: did you check the mosfets? sometimes if mosfets short it wont turn on
[2025-04-05T05:12:14] Matthew: There is some sorta metal on the edges that it seems to mount in to
[2025-04-05T05:13:11] haku: yes. the jst connectors need to be straight. if you force it back in it might bend it
[2025-04-05T05:13:24] Matthew: It turns on. What i did was for some damn reason do an update and lost the app during update and now the button led is orange/yellow
[2025-04-05T05:13:52] haku: yea you might need to reflash that. that i dont know how
[2025-04-05T05:14:06] Matthew: Oh. Nothing bent. I just couldn't get the connector to come out and the whole socket came ouy
[2025-04-05T05:14:09] Matthew: Out*
[2025-04-05T05:14:44] Matthew: Ok, cool. Gives me better idea than just being lost af.
[2025-04-05T05:15:01] haku: the jetson bolt baby. 72v 6fet machine!
[2025-04-05T05:15:31] Matthew: This can sure be frustrating
[2025-04-05T05:16:22] Matthew: I have been really frustrated because 2 85150 purchase i just installed and ran wizard and basically ran.... I've been getting nowhere....
[2025-04-05T05:16:22] haku: yea. vesc basic stuff is easy. but that reflashing or whatever else settings complicated
[2025-04-05T05:16:42] Matthew: I see i see
[2025-04-05T05:17:09] haku: wait for someone here who knows how to flash these spintends
[2025-04-05T05:19:06] Matthew: Teleport for humans need to be figured out already. Being a welder and in many different welding group communities on fb sometime I swear if I could teleport 10 minutes and a nightmare of confusion can be taken care of. Instead trying to explain and not even know if they know what they should see. Like 10 minutes I'd have their issues straight. Instead person has to go at it a few days in a row to try and get stuff right
[2025-04-05T05:21:15] haku: are you still in arizona?
[2025-04-05T05:21:24] haku: or moved
[2025-04-05T05:22:05] Matthew: I'm in new mexico now for 2 weeks.... time is flying.
[2025-04-05T05:22:15] Matthew: Grants, new mexico
[2025-04-05T05:22:27] Matthew: Mountains/volcano 🌋
[2025-04-05T05:22:33] haku: ill be going to arizona end of month
[2025-04-05T05:22:52] haku: new mexico is beautiful
[2025-04-05T05:22:59] haku: food is great
[2025-04-05T05:23:06] Matthew: It's is. Landscape and FOOD
[2025-04-05T05:23:52] Matthew: I'm in navajo nation so it's mostly new Mexican food but some restaurants offer some navajo dishes
[2025-04-05T05:24:07] haku: the local new mexico style foods. im not sure if its mexican food still but very good stuff.
[2025-04-05T05:24:38] Matthew: New Mexican food is different than "MEXICAN"
[2025-04-05T05:25:21] haku: love authentic mexican dishes too. like al pastor tacos
[2025-04-05T05:25:22] Matthew: I think the Spanish cultures adopted navajo dishes and they evolved. New mexico is Chile capital of the world
[2025-04-05T05:25:30] Matthew: For sure
[2025-04-05T05:25:53] haku: anyways offtopic
[2025-04-05T05:26:09] haku: hope someone here helps yoi with flashing
[2025-04-05T05:26:31] Matthew: If family would visit me in Arizona if ask what they want and they actually like traditional Mexican dishes, but I have to emphasize it's Mexican food, not new Mexican
[2025-04-05T05:38:05] Matthew: Even has super thin phase wires. 90kw 🤣
[2025-04-05T05:40:41] Jason: damn
[2025-04-05T05:40:46] Jason: shit blowin up
[2025-04-05T05:41:37] Smart Repair: Was it 85250 for you too?
[2025-04-05T05:48:19] haku: oh dam Noname good or bad idea?
[2025-04-05T05:48:47] haku: looks like a shit welded frame though
[2025-04-05T05:51:21] haku: yes
[2025-04-05T05:52:10] haku: 2hy fets and 1 regular fets. so 3 powerstages
[2025-04-05T05:54:48] haku: im very particular on beautiful welds now. because of you buddy.
[2025-04-05T05:54:48] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-04-05T06:13:21] Smart Repair: Can you describe the situation when the FETs are burned out? Speed/current?
[2025-04-05T06:14:10] Matthew: Thank you! 🙂
[2025-04-05T06:28:21] haku: the first time was stupid. i locked the motor to do a burnout. the 2nd time was a mystery because both of hy powerstages broke. i just pinned the throttle from 5 mile per hour.
[2025-04-05T06:28:42] haku: both of those powerstages used the same logic boards
[2025-04-05T06:29:34] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-04-05T06:30:20] haku: my first setup was 20s 250batery amps/ 300 phase. tbe hy mosfet only had 200 bat/300 phase
[2025-04-05T06:31:43] haku: maybe bms cuttoff. i set bms cuttoff to 520a
[2025-04-05T06:32:05] haku: battery is 20s12p p42 and motor is 70h 33x2
[2025-04-05T06:33:37] haku: i shouldve got em imported from eu from @jamessoderstrom
[2025-04-05T06:33:49] haku: but tarrifs 😭
[2025-04-05T06:33:50] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-04-05T06:36:21] haku: when i fix the cooling please help me tune this
[2025-04-05T06:36:47] haku: maybe some of my settings woke.
[2025-04-05T06:56:08] Smart Repair: ok, that doesn't sound like the same phenomenon as mine
[2025-04-05T06:57:59] haku: thanks bud
[2025-04-05T13:46:50] Martin Kaktits: But how do you power it on and off? U always tell me relay bad. Also, what relay can reliably switch v batt? most small ones top out at 30v, some 60v (above that and it can get sticky).
[2025-04-05T13:53:54] skrtt: Hey guys. Whats the best way to buy something used from someone from france to portugal? Do any of u know any website or service that does that and have protection to the seller and buyer
[2025-04-05T13:59:36] Martin Kaktits: can i use this with 75v? Is it close enough?
[2025-04-05T13:59:49] Jason: i wouldnt
[2025-04-05T14:00:16] Martin Kaktits: these ones would be proper. But they quite chonky
[2025-04-05T14:05:05] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: use two buttons, one for each thing, it's easier
[2025-04-05T14:05:41] Martin Kaktits: im not here for simple solutions 😁
[2025-04-05T14:05:45] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: You can look at the WhatsApp app.
[2025-04-05T14:07:17] Jason: i think i can make
[2025-04-05T14:07:18] Jason: ehehe
[2025-04-05T14:08:17] skrtt: U mean wallopop?

[2025-04-05T14:35:40] Finn: Hey why im getting abs overcurrent faults. I set my max phase to 165A and abs limit to 250A. Still it trips the abs overcurrent. Any ideas?
[2025-04-05T14:36:15] Jason: incorrect tune most likely
[2025-04-05T14:36:19] Jason: like motor cogging
[2025-04-05T14:36:32] Martin Kaktits: When does it happen. Low speed? Tracker might have pproblem and could increase hall rpm
[2025-04-05T14:36:41] Finn: It is my 16s wirh dual blade Motor
[2025-04-05T14:36:49] Finn: Now with 6.06 beta instead of 6.05

[2025-04-05T14:38:16] Finn: Yeah no hall
[2025-04-05T14:38:27] Finn: Arround 80% throttle and 50-60kmh
[2025-04-05T14:38:32] Finn: Only happens on throttle
[2025-04-05T14:40:33] Finn: <photos/photo_22460@05-04-2025_14-40-33.jpg>

[2025-04-05T14:46:09] Finn: Tbh i did run mxlemming before on 6.05 without any mods really

[2025-04-05T14:48:26] Finn: Hmm 1.15
[2025-04-05T14:51:07] Finn: Is that a good starting value?
[2025-04-05T14:53:21] Finn: True😂😂
[2025-04-05T14:54:49] francois schempers: from France you have the website "le bon coin" that have buyer's protection
[2025-04-05T14:55:26] skrtt: Leboncoin dont deliver to portugal either :/
[2025-04-05T15:00:53] francois schempers: eBay ?

[2025-04-05T15:16:06] Jason: lol
[2025-04-05T15:31:50] Finn: It works better but i still get cutoffs
[2025-04-05T15:42:08] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: No, but it is a solution to your problems.
[2025-04-05T16:25:31] skrtt: Ebay have protection?

[2025-04-05T16:49:07] Arnau Martinez Casals: How much phase and bat can handle
[2025-04-05T16:49:25] Arnau Martinez Casals: Its safe to upload to 5.3 firmware?
[2025-04-05T16:50:40] 'lekrsu': High failure rate
[2025-04-05T17:23:00] Finn: Works better with ortega
[2025-04-05T17:50:02] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Running with MTPA? as that pushes when on IQ target easy too much currents
[2025-04-05T17:52:17] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Sorry wrong image but try lowering Motor inductance with 0.5 -1
[2025-04-05T17:53:35] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): No see i am nuts ... inductance difference ....
[2025-04-05T17:53:49] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): thats the one you can lower will prevent tripping over currents
[2025-04-05T17:53:49] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ) has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2025-04-05T19:32:06] Jan: Nobody can know it all, but having at least the openness to learn from others is necessary
[2025-04-05T19:32:20] Jan: For me its all electrical to learn
[2025-04-05T19:33:03] Noname: Anyone want to explain to me how to make a offset battery holder?

[2025-04-06T10:45:06] Jason: ?
[2025-04-06T10:45:14] Jason: <sticker>

[2025-04-06T12:27:13] Smart Repair: What exactly happened? Did the rails come together?
[2025-04-06T14:46:41] Smart Repair: 5V max 150 or 250mA. Only for ADC. But why is the negative battery cable so burnt? That can't possibly be coming from the DC-DC converter.
[2025-04-06T14:47:27] Smart Repair: Or is it dirt on the cable?
[2025-04-06T14:49:00] Mirono escooters: He had m365 dash powered on it too

[2025-04-06T15:53:59] Unknown: yea
[2025-04-06T15:55:00] GABE: 4cm would be enough for 4 cells

[2025-04-06T15:55:40] Unknown: would 1 layer of 0.15 be enough u think?
[2025-04-06T15:55:44] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: To make that person believe that they wanted to do it but never wanted to do it is just for their personal ego 🤣
[2025-04-06T15:55:51] GABE: 60cm
[2025-04-06T15:56:12] GABE: but u need 2 layers
[2025-04-06T15:56:21] GABE: probably not
[2025-04-06T15:56:30] GABE: wanna find out the hard way?
[2025-04-06T15:56:35] Unknown: nah probably not
[2025-04-06T15:56:45] Unknown: the battery is only 50A total? so 0.15 isnt enough
[2025-04-06T15:56:48] GABE: so need 1.2m so 2 rolls
[2025-04-06T15:57:54] Unknown: is 0.15 enough for 50A total?
[2025-04-06T15:58:17] GABE: you will find out if your battery shorts while youre driving

[2025-04-06T16:57:12] Давно пора: I believe for 50a it's okay nickel as it is
[2025-04-06T16:57:19] Давно пора: But better 2 layers(for less voltage sag)
[2025-04-06T16:57:28] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ok
[2025-04-06T16:57:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Only harder then tubles
[2025-04-06T17:02:03] Давно пора: I weld with wider(10mm) but thin (0.15-0.20) nickel strips
[2025-04-06T17:02:47] Давно пора: For 21700 of low-mid power it's more than enough
[2025-04-06T17:04:44] Roby MacGyver: good morning, a vesc expert he told me that I probably burned the mosfet of my makerbase 75100 because there was a small power outage, so he advised me to put some protections in the vesc tool to avoid burning again in the event of a power failure but these protections in the vesc tool where do I put them?can you help me please? thanks
[2025-04-06T17:22:52] Noname: Harder? It's easier it doesn't need to seal against rim to fill.with air
[2025-04-06T17:23:28] Noname: Put baby powder on tube helps keep from rubbing a hole in tube
[2025-04-06T17:57:17] haku: dam front neighbor bought the new tesla model3. they are burning our cars. old man has no clue
[2025-04-06T17:58:25] haku: its red too 😭
[2025-04-06T18:02:38] Noname: 50a on 4 strips of nickle?
[2025-04-06T18:04:30] Noname: Ah that's why your hurrying to build g30v3
[2025-04-06T18:08:21] Mirono escooters: Just unlucky wiring
[2025-04-06T18:10:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Tesla?
[2025-04-06T18:10:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: https://www.facebook.com/share/r/19VVugfHQn/
[2025-04-06T18:10:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Don't think I have that in my house I'll check
[2025-04-06T18:11:16] haku: the peak g30v2 will be tesla neighborhood patrol. i will ask HOA if they can pay me to protect thier cars
[2025-04-06T18:11:29] Noname: You have hoa
[2025-04-06T18:11:44] haku: ofcourse. who doesnt
[2025-04-06T18:11:50] haku: this is the hood boy
[2025-04-06T18:12:00] Noname: It's not hood with HOA
[2025-04-06T18:12:10] Noname: I'd never live in one
[2025-04-06T18:12:30] haku: you can put all your hoard outside then. not allowed in mine
[2025-04-06T18:12:50] Noname: I can do whatever I want and I do
[2025-04-06T18:13:24] haku: thats why i want to move in a off grid.
[2025-04-06T18:13:41] haku: shoot in your backyard whenever you want
[2025-04-06T18:14:45] haku: idk where to get water source though. that will be a problem

[2025-04-06T18:23:14] Unknown: so i need 1.2M
[2025-04-06T18:27:27] Sergio Lopez: Hey guys, I just wanted some opinions to find out what's going on with the front motor on my scooter. It "works but stops," just like I do, and it stops and stops when I use it. This happens.
[2025-04-06T18:31:36] Noname: What thickness nickle
[2025-04-06T18:32:28] Noname: Mabey bad hall sensor.
[2025-04-06T18:32:40] Unknown: 0.15mm
[2025-04-06T18:33:41] 'lekrsu': How many strips of that create your series connections?
[2025-04-06T18:34:08] Noname: 4a per strip
[2025-04-06T18:34:48] Noname: 20s4p?
[2025-04-06T18:34:54] Unknown: its for 15s4p
[2025-04-06T18:34:54] Noname: @Amel0685
[2025-04-06T18:35:03] 'lekrsu': Yes but how's the layout?
[2025-04-06T18:35:08] Noname: So 16a with that nickle
[2025-04-06T18:35:12] Unknown: its just the classic one
[2025-04-06T18:35:15] Unknown: idk how to explain it
[2025-04-06T18:35:22] Noname: 4 batterys wide
[2025-04-06T18:35:26] 'lekrsu': 1, 2, 3, 4?
[2025-04-06T18:35:55] 'lekrsu': You'll be fine with 10A per strip with pure, half with plated.
[2025-04-06T18:35:56] Noname: 5,6,7,8
[2025-04-06T18:36:11] 'lekrsu': Why are you trolling
[2025-04-06T18:36:17] Noname: 🤷‍♂️
[2025-04-06T18:36:45] Unknown: huh
[2025-04-06T18:36:52] Unknown: its 4 series connections i believe
[2025-04-06T18:36:56] Unknown: if i understand correctly
[2025-04-06T18:37:55] 'lekrsu': Approximately up to 40A is fine for pure then. Is it?
[2025-04-06T18:38:27] Noname: So your a bit undersized on Nickle
[2025-04-06T18:38:42] Unknown: is 3 meters enough you think?
[2025-04-06T18:39:13] 'lekrsu': You can leave parallel as is but weld a second layer of nickel plate on every series.
[2025-04-06T18:39:18] Noname: This
[2025-04-06T18:39:59] Unknown: but is 3meters enough
[2025-04-06T18:40:04] 'lekrsu': Nickel is relatively cheap, used 5 meters for 20s6p once.
[2025-04-06T18:40:28] Unknown: i bought 3 meters
[2025-04-06T18:40:30] Unknown: should be enough
[2025-04-06T18:40:31] 'lekrsu': But that was a roll, not a premade layout.
[2025-04-06T18:42:54] Noname: 15s needs about 15 pieces of 2p. 4 batterys wide is roughly 80mm x 15 = 1.2m
[2025-04-06T18:43:34] Noname: So you have enough for double and a few miss cuts
[2025-04-06T18:43:43] Unknown: thats good
[2025-04-06T20:20:33] Matte: you need about 12mm2 of cross section area for 50A if we are talking pure nickel
[2025-04-06T20:21:17] Matte: Amel, if youre talking balkanese you can dm me
[2025-04-06T21:18:54] Unknown: wdym balkanese
[2025-04-06T21:19:21] Matte: Amel, do you not speak bosnian or something

[2025-04-06T21:20:03] Matte: Ah alrighty, i almost started joking in a balkan way you wouldnt understand
[2025-04-06T21:20:19] Unknown: oh haha i only understand a bit but i dont speak
[2025-04-06T21:21:16] Matte: Its ok Amel, we both speak english
[2025-04-06T21:21:23] Unknown: yes
[2025-04-06T21:22:00] Matte: so youre trying to build your own pack?
[2025-04-06T21:22:12] Unknown: no this is for my friend

[2025-04-06T21:23:09] Matte: so the 50 amp discharge pack is for your friend
[2025-04-06T21:23:19] Unknown: yes it is
[2025-04-06T21:24:19] Matte: ill DM i dont wanna spam here
[2025-04-07T00:14:10] Matthew: I can't remember if you mentioned if you were going to build a 65h with them newer crazy powerful magnets available that make 65h like I think mentioned 90h??
[2025-04-07T00:41:58] haku: @SirModAlot what did you say dont insult them about paying $300 for 2 g30s? theres no shame when they agree boy!
[2025-04-07T00:42:41] Jan: The field strength would be equivalent
[2025-04-07T00:43:15] Jason: 150 per g30
[2025-04-07T00:43:16] Jason: soo
[2025-04-07T00:43:21] Jason: I guess it's farely good deal

[2025-04-07T03:08:07] haku: fancy
[2025-04-07T03:08:21] haku: how you even fit a compressor in that
[2025-04-07T03:08:41] Noname: It's a shop compressor
[2025-04-07T03:09:22] haku: must be good eh. every tool on your disposal
[2025-04-07T03:10:38] Noname: Yes I carry this behind scooter
[2025-04-07T03:10:44] Noname: I don't like battery pump. I have a bike mini pump for the road.
[2025-04-07T03:11:13] Noname: I don't have every tool. Just what I needed for my hobbies
[2025-04-07T03:13:18] haku: what that xiaomi pump everyone keeps talking about
[2025-04-07T03:18:36] Jason: the pump she told you not to worry about
[2025-04-07T03:18:38] Noname: It's expensive just wrap.your lips around Schrader valve
[2025-04-07T03:18:57] Noname: It's a beast though. Runs my sandblasting set up
[2025-04-07T03:19:04] Jason: mmh

[2025-04-07T04:38:27] haku: google is compromized
[2025-04-07T04:38:47] haku: they will use my paint stripper search against me
[2025-04-07T04:38:53] Noname: Bing, Yahoo, Blits whatever search engine
[2025-04-07T04:39:02] haku: they are all bad
[2025-04-07T04:39:11] Noname: Ask a neighbor

[2025-04-07T04:40:21] Noname: Umm I'd imagine a paint store or hell a hardware store would be a good place to search for forbidden stripper

[2025-04-07T15:11:08] Smart Repair: How did you desolder the MOSFETs? What method did you use?
[2025-04-07T15:13:13] yoann tsobanoglou: Soldering hot plate
[2025-04-07T15:15:30] yoann tsobanoglou: But always good to have soldering pen to facilitate movement
[2025-04-07T15:29:13] Paolo ⁭: Doesn't sound very smart
[2025-04-07T15:45:42] Noname: It's not, weight is an issue
[2025-04-07T15:54:01] Noname: Can't wait to get my motor. Not gonna tell my friends, see if they notice I'm a lot faster lol
[2025-04-07T15:54:24] Smart Repair: Several times a week, people ask for a button for switching profiles. Is there anyone here who can write a universal script? I'd be willing to pay for the work.
[2025-04-07T16:01:47] Finn: Profiles are stored locally on your phone. Thus you need a lisp script which you cannot configure with your mobile phone app.
[2025-04-07T16:22:17] Smart Repair: I know that. That's why I'm asking for a script. Or you can do it with an esp. But there's no ready-made script for that either. At least, none that I know of.

[2025-04-07T17:11:57] Face de Pin Sucé: By Rage Mechanics
[2025-04-07T17:12:40] Paolo ⁭: Everything good but lool two calipers
[2025-04-07T17:12:59] Paolo ⁭: Would make sense if was double disc
[2025-04-07T17:13:33] Face de Pin Sucé: You need to go on a race track to understand that x)
[2025-04-07T17:14:17] Paolo ⁭: Disc will overheat anyway
[2025-04-07T17:29:41] Yamal: Beautiful
[2025-04-07T17:29:59] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: or something more than normal
[2025-04-07T17:34:53] Jan: I think you will boil the brake fluid from overheating caliper first
[2025-04-07T17:35:18] Jan: Custom motor?
[2025-04-07T17:43:48] Unknown: Is that scooter built on a previous base
[2025-04-07T17:45:42] Jan: Its written in the picture
[2025-04-07T17:46:44] Jan: Only original frame
[2025-04-07T17:47:58] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Specs
[2025-04-07T17:48:52] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: @jamaludin_algarnati 🩷(u didn't have to like all my posts ahahaha)
[2025-04-07T17:55:50] Smart Repair: Do you have any more information about what you were able to do with Express?
[2025-04-07T18:02:47] Yamal: let the dance begin
[2025-04-07T18:03:23] Yamal: Did you end up repairing the 85/240?
[2025-04-07T18:07:02] yoann tsobanoglou: You can do anything you want. I built a vesc express following the guide with a esp32 board. And what that allows me to do is use gpio available ports to either get inputs or give outputs.
[2025-04-07T18:09:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No 😞 no money yet
[2025-04-07T18:09:35] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Waiting for the 10th
[2025-04-07T18:10:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also need a new tyre so currently scooter disabled
[2025-04-07T18:10:57] yoann tsobanoglou: an old example i can show you, not to be reproduced as it is not optimized and heavy on ram, is that since we didnt have space for a adc board from spintend, we started looking if we could attach the ebrakes on port 2 and 3 of the esp32 board and see if it could trigger ebrake.

[2025-04-07T18:14:03] Face de Pin Sucé: It doesn't, those pictures are literally taken during races
[2025-04-07T18:14:18] Face de Pin Sucé: Not even one actually
[2025-04-07T18:14:37] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, new 2025 Rage motor
[2025-04-07T18:14:56] Face de Pin Sucé: No, it's done, 100% Rage Mechanics parts
[2025-04-07T18:17:41] yoann tsobanoglou: you could do the same, where the act of triggering the button would change "power-scale". You can even create a list of power-scales(virtual profiles) that would be switched by each trigger of the button and have it stored in memory for each time the scooter restarts.

[2025-04-07T18:19:38] haku: even steering damper
[2025-04-07T18:20:14] haku: why not mount brembo moto brakes?
[2025-04-07T18:26:48] Face de Pin Sucé: Because it's too wide
[2025-04-07T18:30:21] yoann tsobanoglou: (conf-set 'max-speed (/ 25 3.6)) ; Set the maximum speed to 25 km/h

[2025-04-07T18:35:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I want you to once build a scooter for drag racing to show all of those nuc guys who is boss in the controller market
[2025-04-07T18:38:45] skrtt: I would love to see it in a bigger track
[2025-04-07T18:39:01] skrtt: Instead of 60kmh turns would be like 100
[2025-04-07T18:41:42] haku: shit china lifting belt snapped and broke off. im too fat. good thing i have a spare buckle when i was skinny.
[2025-04-07T18:42:19] Matte: Yamal people thought you died
[2025-04-07T18:43:39] haku: ive been told you testified on him. but he plead not guilty
[2025-04-07T18:44:40] haku: i need to buy that rogue american made belt boys. too expensive 😭
[2025-04-07T20:44:53] puneDir: WHERE WAS YOU?
[2025-04-07T20:44:59] puneDir: WE THOUGHT YOURE DEAD
[2025-04-07T20:45:25] puneDir: <photos/photo_22494@07-04-2025_20-45-25.jpg>
[2025-04-07T20:45:37] puneDir: I even called here to ask about you
[2025-04-07T20:46:56] haku: he died and ressurected by vedder
[2025-04-07T20:55:43] Yamal: Dead why?
[2025-04-07T20:57:32] Face de Pin Sucé: Now we use something different
[2025-04-07T20:57:42] Face de Pin Sucé: Haha would be nice when I have time
[2025-04-07T20:57:55] Yamal: Rochee sent me a WhatsApp to my cell phone at 2:30/3 in the morning😁I was very happy to see it, Swiss license plate xD
[2025-04-07T21:01:16] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Well i had some lisp for the RF remote that could swap between 2 profiles .... but in general take any ESP hook it up to the serial port of VESC and fire the commands needed. On ESP define x inputs for your buttons and hook them to the right commands.
[2025-04-07T21:01:55] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Let me dig that file it's obsolete now with the Bridge
[2025-04-07T21:02:10] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): <files/remote_1.lisp>
[2025-04-07T21:03:53] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): and for the slave esc's:

[2025-04-07T21:13:41] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-04-07T21:20:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What??
[2025-04-07T21:21:28] Yamal: 🤐
[2025-04-07T21:22:04] Yamal: state secret
[2025-04-07T21:23:53] Yamal: Not everything can be shared lightly... xD, but the 3shull are already history with the fastest 11-inch vehicle in the world, I like Indian food more and more, even though Haku doesn't like curry.
[2025-04-07T21:24:20] haku: my stregnth returned yamal now your back

[2025-04-07T21:27:09] Yamal: You haven't left the bar unturned! I'm glad, always strong! I hope you've already set your sights on a pretty girl.
[2025-04-07T21:28:23] Yamal: Strong men always need beautiful women by their side... to cook grilled chicken breasts with boiled rice.
[2025-04-07T21:28:55] Yamal: like Ronie or Kai
[2025-04-07T21:29:13] haku: not yet yamal. not yet

[2025-04-07T21:31:18] Yamal: These last few days I've been watching America... things are getting tricky, and you know that if things get ugly any further, you have a house in Europe for you, your son, and your dog. xD

[2025-04-07T21:41:32] Yamal: Summer is coming xD
[2025-04-07T21:42:28] Yamal: How are the people in the Segway tuning group? I haven't joined yet.

[2025-04-07T22:37:26] Yamal: The bear leaves the cave with the arrival of spring
[2025-04-07T22:38:21] Noname: It's freezing rain, 2 weeks mabey left
[2025-04-07T22:39:20] Yamal: You have motorcycles even in the bathroom, I imagine.
[2025-04-07T22:39:25] Noname: Gotta button up things. Charge port, phone charger and bodywork back on
[2025-04-07T22:39:37] Noname: Na my basement is big

[2025-04-07T22:40:58] Yamal: Hehee
[2025-04-07T22:41:26] Noname: You don't trip.over scooter parts when showering your doing it wrong
[2025-04-07T22:41:30] Yamal: When the sun comes out you start until autumn close to winter
[2025-04-07T22:42:14] Yamal: Did you put cows on the ranch at the end?
[2025-04-07T22:42:40] Noname: What 😆 I have no cows
[2025-04-07T22:43:12] Yamal: Check it out, things are getting hot...
[2025-04-07T22:44:05] Noname: @Bradhaku please translate your boys incripted messages
[2025-04-07T22:52:51] Smart Repair: I don't know anything about software. Would you be willing to create a script? I need two profiles. Profile 1: 20 km/h, 1500W, single drive. Profile 2: 150 km/h, 30,000W dual drive. It would be great if I could give each motor different values. Not only I, but many people out there would appreciate a script like this. As far as I know, there is currently no freely available ESP script that switches between profiles with a button.
[2025-04-07T23:27:37] Yamal: What I mean is that if you have the space, it's never a bad idea to have some farmyard animals. Overall, things are in turmoil
[2025-04-07T23:30:59] haku: he said. bitch get out and ride you moped.
[2025-04-07T23:31:25] haku: thats the translation to american

[2025-04-08T00:02:45] Yamal: Cafe lathe
[2025-04-08T00:19:15] Noname: Yes I'm a bitch I should be outside in the 35° rain riding my moped and enjoying the depressingly grey sky
[2025-04-08T00:20:34] Noname: You need to have a farm here like several acres. I have .6 prob can get chickens but I'd just eat my neighbors he's old and won't put up a fight. Plenty of squirrels if those are tatsy
[2025-04-08T00:26:57] Noname: Think I need some of those

[2025-04-08T03:13:12] Noname: 100% they bend or snap off in a week
[2025-04-08T03:14:16] Noname: @Bradhaku prove Mr wrong
[2025-04-08T03:39:13] haku: lets see.
[2025-04-08T03:39:43] haku: look just enough clearance on the seat.
[2025-04-08T03:52:13] JPPL: No bend.
[2025-04-08T03:57:34] Noname: Ok we gonna place bets

[2025-04-08T04:03:04] haku: if i can fit laotie axles on this i can defenitly fit 80h. but 10" tires will be hard
[2025-04-08T04:13:11] Noname: You don't have a lot of battery though
[2025-04-08T04:20:48] haku: 40t ill reasemble it. doublw stacked and cut the top and someone reweld it
[2025-04-08T04:22:26] haku: like this. maybe the v3 version.
[2025-04-08T04:23:02] haku: cut the red part the bar and have someone weld a bigger triangle
[2025-04-08T04:23:43] haku: we will see how this one goes first
[2025-04-08T05:31:33] Noname: <photos/photo_22510@08-04-2025_05-31-33.jpg>
[2025-04-08T05:36:18] Noname: @Bradhaku can you stand 2 batterys on the side in that box? Then put controller in triangle
[2025-04-08T05:38:32] haku: im only lvl 1 cad designer/engineer
[2025-04-08T05:39:53] Noname: Yeah but could 2 batterys fit box
[2025-04-08T05:40:24] haku: i said cut the top bar then have someone extend it then weld
[2025-04-08T05:40:32] Noname: So when I build 2wd mini V4g60 you gonna buy it
[2025-04-08T05:41:13] haku: your haku industries shareholder. your design is my design
[2025-04-08T05:41:29] Noname: I'll just build it and hang it from my rafters. Make sure it's in background of any photo I take
[2025-04-08T05:42:12] haku: that be a heathen move of you install the qs on it. definetly jelly
[2025-04-08T05:42:50] Noname: Waiting for a 10" moped
[2025-04-08T05:43:00] haku: c80 isnt 10?
[2025-04-08T05:43:21] Noname: It's an ebike, motor weighs more than the frame and wheels
[2025-04-08T05:43:41] haku: so? its fine
[2025-04-08T05:44:02] Noname: Do you not understand the mass of this thing
[2025-04-08T05:44:03] haku: i would do it if i had fabrication skills
[2025-04-08T05:44:09] haku: i know dude
[2025-04-08T05:44:44] haku: you prolly need a seven vesc or God forbid a fardriver
[2025-04-08T05:46:15] Noname: <photos/photo_22511@08-04-2025_05-46-15.jpg>
[2025-04-08T05:46:34] haku: lawd
[2025-04-08T05:46:52] haku: just use it
[2025-04-08T05:47:01] haku: such a waste of a good motor
[2025-04-08T05:47:55] Noname: I did not realize the absurdity when shopping
[2025-04-08T05:48:21] haku: you fabricator tool master extrordinare. do it
[2025-04-08T05:52:32] Noname: I have 2 unfinished projects now dude
[2025-04-08T05:52:58] Noname: Emoped then ebike then 20s Vsett
[2025-04-08T05:53:08] haku: do the c80 while waiting fir niu motors
[2025-04-08T05:53:18] haku: fuck the vsett
[2025-04-08T05:53:27] Noname: Moped first it works. Simple swap.later
[2025-04-08T05:53:38] Noname: <animation>
[2025-04-08T05:54:19] haku: vsett keep hard to sell if modded just saying
[2025-04-08T05:55:01] Noname: It's modded already
[2025-04-08T05:55:28] haku: thats a keeper then haha
[2025-04-08T06:35:07] Yamal: Almost ready..
[2025-04-08T06:40:18] Yamal: I really need to modify my g2 max, even more when I see those photos... but there is no time or money
[2025-04-08T06:40:36] Yamal: lololololololololololololololololol
[2025-04-08T06:40:45] haku: 1 project at a time
[2025-04-08T06:42:05] Yamal: 25kmh and not Vesc controller …….
[2025-04-08T06:42:23] Yamal: lolololololololololololololololololololol
[2025-04-08T06:42:23] haku: that c80 motor what tire size on that?
[2025-04-08T06:42:40] haku: thats okay
[2025-04-08T06:42:57] Yamal: Really look nice

[2025-04-08T06:49:01] Yamal: Spintend 85/240 65h17/4
[2025-04-08T06:53:18] Yamal: It will be the moment when Nami is arrested
[2025-04-08T07:01:09] Yamal: By the way, the scanner to digitize photos is a great invention ^^
[2025-04-08T07:01:14] Jason: mmmmmm
[2025-04-08T07:01:27] Jason: mmm
[2025-04-08T07:01:30] Jason: 25kph
[2025-04-08T07:01:35] Jason: and motor sucks
[2025-04-08T07:03:10] Paolo ⁭: Let's do double of this
[2025-04-08T07:14:32] Yamal: On g30,,?
[2025-04-08T07:15:06] Yamal: Ónix brand ,,?
[2025-04-08T07:23:23] Paolo ⁭: Dnis is the brand name
[2025-04-08T07:23:54] Yamal: Nice
[2025-04-08T07:24:17] Yamal: Are you still tied to the wolf on the ladder?
[2025-04-08T07:24:56] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2025-04-08T07:27:24] Yamal: ^^
[2025-04-08T07:33:16] Yamal: <voice_message>
[2025-04-08T07:34:03] Yamal: The only thing I hear when I wake up xD
[2025-04-08T07:43:11] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): I got those incoming :)
[2025-04-08T07:44:56] yoann tsobanoglou: why do you need limitation in watts ? do police also measure this?
[2025-04-08T08:47:15] Yamal: Are you ready!? Are you sad!? Open vesc tool and it will be enough
[2025-04-08T08:57:15] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Tell me how it looks, a friend has them but never tells me anything, that's not a friend or anything hahaha
[2025-04-08T09:01:36] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Yeah will share all the info i can when i have them. Working with them together to get them more suited for e-scooters as they lack a few things. For now as far as we have seen they would fit the GT with a minimal spacer in the front part of the brake. (at least at Dnis they compared a 3D scan with their brakes) If thats the case they will look into supplying spacers for various sizes. Anyway great bunch of people behind Dnis very responsive and willing to work out something for our use.
[2025-04-08T09:01:58] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Now waiting till they arrive this takes a bit longer as i had of course some special request :)
[2025-04-08T09:10:12] Jason: mm
[2025-04-08T09:20:34] Paolo ⁭: How much $?
[2025-04-08T09:27:03] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): See their website: https://dnisbrakes.com/products/dnis-v6-6-piston-brake
[2025-04-08T09:27:17] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Longer hoses can be supplied on request.
[2025-04-08T09:32:45] Yamal: 166?
[2025-04-08T09:32:52] Yamal: 2 or 4
[2025-04-08T09:32:55] Yamal: I mean kit
[2025-04-08T09:51:56] Rose: Hey there L’itali3n, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-04-08T09:54:46] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): then 166x2
[2025-04-08T09:55:18] Yamal: Merci gt rider
[2025-04-08T10:03:02] Rose: Hey there L’itali3n, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-04-08T11:26:38] Yamal: Waiting for your speed test
[2025-04-08T11:27:54] Yamal: Also very nice your are, you live in an area with countryside!
[2025-04-08T11:28:54] Yamal: Did you end up installing both 85/240 or just one?
[2025-04-08T11:30:10] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Both GT's will be Rear 85240 and front 85150. Main difference between bot GT's: 1 has dual GT1 motors othe has dual GT2 motors 1 has EVE 40P 20S9P pack other EVE 50E 20S9P
[2025-04-08T11:30:40] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): The fastest one (so the GT2 motors) will get the Dnis brakes
[2025-04-08T11:31:01] Yamal: Two diferent controller you mean
[2025-04-08T11:33:11] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Yes 1x 150 and 1x 240 as i dont need that massive power on the front
[2025-04-08T11:33:31] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): 160 Phase 80 Batt is already hard to handle on front motor
[2025-04-08T11:35:05] Yamal: Nice
[2025-04-08T11:35:29] Yamal: On gt geometry xD
[2025-04-08T11:37:13] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Yeah it can handle the power and zero steering wobble (no dampner) main issue is i have to shift so much weight to front to fight the suspension when accelerating to keep front on the ground. You might start wonder to reduce power on rear so rear motor doesnt tilt the scooter that much.
[2025-04-08T11:58:35] Smart Repair: Without a limitation of benefits, I would have to pay the policeman lifelong compensation
[2025-04-08T12:05:13] Yamal: What do you mean: that the scooter does wheelies on its own against your will?
[2025-04-08T12:05:52] Roby MacGyver: good morning, is it possible to change profiles via a button? on the vesc makerbase 84100 hp, if so can you explain to me how?
[2025-04-08T12:13:44] Jason: mine does
[2025-04-08T12:13:49] Jason: 0 to 60kmh
[2025-04-08T12:13:57] Jason: it does wheelies on its own
[2025-04-08T12:14:06] Jason: mmm grip problem
[2025-04-08T12:16:38] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): That too as no PMT exist for GT motors (7" Rim)
[2025-04-08T12:17:07] Jason: more weight at front
[2025-04-08T12:17:08] Jason: ehehehe
[2025-04-08T12:17:12] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): The power is such it tries to lift the front yeah so you have to lean forward.
[2025-04-08T12:17:33] Jason: I hope
[2025-04-08T12:17:39] Jason: more forced wheelies with better batt
[2025-04-08T12:17:57] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Even more ... damn scooter weighs already 60Kg 😂
[2025-04-08T12:18:02] Jason: lol
[2025-04-08T12:18:32] Jason: I should really shorten the phase wires
[2025-04-08T12:18:37] yoann tsobanoglou: So the machine can also track power? If the police stops you and checks top speed and it’s 20km/h does it matter the watts ?
[2025-04-08T12:22:03] yoann tsobanoglou: Am building a script now, but I need time to test it and that it works. I will try to see if it can store multiple values for multiple profiles maybe it would be smart to allow profiles to be switched only with brake applied to that police can’t press button and unlock profiles by themselves
[2025-04-08T12:23:26] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): I wish we could do that for the GT rear motor and slap the esc on the rear. But 0 space for that
[2025-04-08T12:23:28] Smart Repair: In Germany, 600W is permitted. What happens if the officer accidentally presses the throttle while stationary and the scooter flies away? It's also important that the 20 km/h mode only uses single-drive motors.
[2025-04-08T12:23:58] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): And moving battery also no option.
[2025-04-08T12:24:24] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-04-08T12:24:29] Jason: mmm
[2025-04-08T12:24:46] Jason: spaaace
[2025-04-08T12:24:55] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): <photos/photo_22514@08-04-2025_12-24-55.jpg>
[2025-04-08T12:25:00] Smart Repair: Take all the time you need. If you need help testing, let me know.
[2025-04-08T12:25:10] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-04-08T12:25:32] 'lekrsu': Do it then
[2025-04-08T12:25:40] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Add this one to your sticker pack please ;)
[2025-04-08T12:26:07] Jason: I am going to after i grind rails and put 30s4p inside
[2025-04-08T12:26:22] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2025-04-08T12:27:14] Jason: maybe JasonESC Mini also inside
[2025-04-08T12:27:30] Jason: 12fet toll 150v
[2025-04-08T12:28:53] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Actually peak is way more alowed (see sagway pushing 2.4kw legal. And Dual motors aint a option although the ABE from the one you would use likewise states single motor.
[2025-04-08T12:29:47] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): As told i am sure this can be done without lisp script if i have an esc free can do some testing on what we discussed (not the script you already have from me)
[2025-04-08T13:12:03] Yamal: Toll why no Tolt
[2025-04-08T13:24:48] Yamal: Maybe tolt never fit in your pcbsSs
[2025-04-08T13:35:10] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: In a few days we will have the Nami working to measure ourselves again with the motorcycles hahaha
[2025-04-08T13:37:45] Yamal: ?
[2025-04-08T13:39:17] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I'm waiting for news but last night he told me he came home after the races and saw the package with 4 controllers 🤗
[2025-04-08T13:39:40] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: That means the package arrived at its destination hahaha
[2025-04-08T13:41:28] Yamal: ❤️‍🔥⚡️
[2025-04-08T13:49:59] Jason: tolt expensive
[2025-04-08T13:55:51] Yamal: But fit or no fit
[2025-04-08T14:10:02] Jason: if mp2 fits it fits
[2025-04-08T14:11:08] Yamal: Very nice 👍

[2025-04-08T16:24:48] haku: 3 or 4 generations of photos. jeebus
[2025-04-08T16:27:30] Yamal: Incredible... you must be the son of a prime minister or something like that, I must have a couple of shoe boxes with some of these big books with photos...
[2025-04-08T16:29:15] haku: haha no. my family just like taking photos. asians are like that
[2025-04-08T16:29:57] haku: ill be prime minister of mars though
[2025-04-08T16:31:39] haku: my dad and his dad was also into cameras. thats why
[2025-04-08T16:48:44] haku: look like 40t wraps
[2025-04-08T16:52:07] Matte: user on reddit expects 125A temp controlled or 225A peak from this battery pack :/
[2025-04-08T16:57:54] haku: what cells
[2025-04-08T16:58:14] haku: and what size nickle?
[2025-04-08T16:59:04] Matte: does it even matter what cells with these interconnections. They didnt even show how they connected the series at the bms wiring connector side :S Its samsung 50s apparently
[2025-04-08T17:00:23] Jason: 125a thru those weak looking connection???
[2025-04-08T17:00:24] Jason: bruh
[2025-04-08T17:01:12] Matte: i mean they can handle 125A......if youre okay with them reaching 130°C above ambient temperature
[2025-04-08T17:59:23] yoann tsobanoglou: Why not use lisp ? Runs better and faster and can handle canbus msg to handle multiple devices at once ?
[2025-04-08T18:02:10] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Lisp is an option he also has from me i made that a while ago. But this gives him only one button ..... with a ESP injecting to serial you have as many PGIO's you have :)
[2025-04-08T18:12:11] Patrick: How many voltage did you guy ride maximum with spintend 22s? I doing 22s and over 22kw. Everything very good. No problems. My friend changed now also his nami to vesc setup. First test 85V after 1min controller blow up. Phase amp was set to 200only. I do not understand what heppened? 🥹

[2025-04-08T18:22:17] Noname: 7a per connection not 70a lol
[2025-04-08T18:25:17] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Forgot to turn regen off? (or at least set the right regen V limits? (defaults in VESC are 1000V)

[2025-04-08T21:01:40] Patrick: Stock fets but i did a big research and the JMSH should be more stable than HY

[2025-04-09T06:57:57] Yamal: Good morning, I don't have that configuration, I was talking about it being a possible option for the G2 in the future.
[2025-04-09T07:31:55] Yamal: 22/3 dual very good
[2025-04-09T07:54:05] Yamal: XD start the day

[2025-04-09T11:57:26] Face de Pin Sucé: I've discussed with him, but I don't like the pistons size
[2025-04-09T12:15:12] francois schempers: pm
[2025-04-09T12:30:56] francois schempers: my solution is simple, you put à default profile that goes 25km/h at 1000w of power, and you setup à profile beside it with all to the max that you set with the phone each time you want to use it, you set it until restart. so if police finds you, you just have to power off the scooter, when they will turn it on it will be on default profile, and they have no means to switch profile in anyway, except if they have the Vesc app, but even then you have solutions, you could put your Bluetooth module in stealth mode, meaning it doesn't broadcast its presence and you need it's mac adresse to connect to it, you'll have to enter it each time you connect, it's like a master password
[2025-04-09T12:37:53] Smart Repair: This is just a temporary solution... Restarting the scooter in the evening is a pain. The lights go off and on again. Then you can forget about throttling. The police aren't stupid; it's their job. And the script isn't just about me. So many people want the option to switch profiles.
[2025-04-09T12:39:49] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Police even watches if you try to press a button. One of the reasons we have it with the GT bridge under the Walk function as this is less obvious :)
[2025-04-09T12:40:06] Smart Repair: and there is currently no way to assign different values for front and rear engines.
[2025-04-09T12:40:47] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Not yet thats right. V1 was never intended for these massive tweaked setups. But he ... thats where V2 comes in ;)
[2025-04-09T12:41:04] Smart Repair: It's possible to press a button on the remote control in your pocket, but yes, you really have to be careful.
[2025-04-09T12:42:01] Smart Repair: This script isn't just about me. A LOT OF PEOPLE want this.
[2025-04-09T12:42:27] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): So the remote control one you have from me ... works perfect but also there have to change a few things due diferent motor setups since that lisp of me uses can FWD and sends same setting to 2nd esc.
[2025-04-09T12:43:17] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): For anyone with same motor the script is there. Also there was something linked to use an express (not the one you use for logging since all pins are used)
[2025-04-09T12:44:47] Smart Repair: Everywhere people ask about the possibility, and everywhere you read that it's possible. But nowhere is there a freely accessible script that offers these actually simple options. Sorry for the bad translation, my English is terrible. I use a translator.
[2025-04-09T12:46:00] Smart Repair: Exactly, it only supports single. It can't switch between 20 km/h single and open dual.
[2025-04-09T14:29:00] Yamal: If you wear black sunglasses, even better
[2025-04-09T14:42:51] Arnau Martinez Casals: Hi I just buyed cheap a niu kqi3 without electronic
[2025-04-09T14:43:23] Smart Repair: Here in Germany, things are a little different. Turning it off only reinforces the suspicion of manipulation.
[2025-04-09T14:43:35] Arnau Martinez Casals: Anybode knows if this motor alredy has temp sensor?
[2025-04-09T14:44:16] Unknown: should be the white one right?
[2025-04-09T14:44:45] Arnau Martinez Casals: <animation>
[2025-04-09T14:45:47] Arnau Martinez Casals: I thinck, idk why new scooter has 6 hall wires, the extra one is for temp?
[2025-04-09T14:46:41] Unknown: not really sure tbh
[2025-04-09T14:47:55] Arnau Martinez Casals: 300w stock motor,… gonna burn it with the Ubox100100
[2025-04-09T14:53:24] GABE: Keep it it's very nice for a 12s cruiser
[2025-04-09T14:54:52] Arnau Martinez Casals: Spain is harder, what I do is take out my phone when i got stopped while police is aking for papers and upload limited file via bt with the voyage megan display
[2025-04-09T14:59:38] Arnau Martinez Casals: 12s? Who said, cruiser for me is 16s minimum
[2025-04-09T15:00:07] Arnau Martinez Casals: I got one little 16s 3p molicel
[2025-04-09T15:04:47] GABE: 10s is a ride man
[2025-04-09T15:05:02] GABE: micro engines blowing constantly
[2025-04-09T15:05:06] Smart Repair: It's not just about me. Hundreds of people have been asking for this option for years. Of course, there's the option to switch profiles with your phone. But that doesn't help if you want to switch while driving, for example.
[2025-04-09T15:05:24] GABE: 2p 20s blows a motor daily
[2025-04-09T15:05:47] Arnau Martinez Casals: Yes mimimum 50h torque
[2025-04-09T15:05:53] GABE: ahh
[2025-04-09T15:06:00] GABE: valid
[2025-04-09T15:06:17] GABE: so u burning this?
[2025-04-09T15:06:33] Arnau Martinez Casals: Im gona push 80a phase i think
[2025-04-09T15:06:37] Arnau Martinez Casals: 60v
[2025-04-09T15:06:41] Arnau Martinez Casals: Lets see
[2025-04-09T15:06:45] Arnau Martinez Casals: 😂😂
[2025-04-09T15:07:18] GABE: wouldn't use fwk cause if motor blows it's a different story
[2025-04-09T15:08:10] Arnau Martinez Casals: Nono
[2025-04-09T15:08:59] Arnau Martinez Casals: No more fw for me i prefer more phase A and speed motors
[2025-04-09T15:36:27] Yamal: Have you ever thought about chasing them with 35kw?
[2025-04-09T15:38:40] Yamal: I have never actually used a speed limiting device, and I only created the profiles in Vesc tool with the idea of being more efficient and doing more kilometers on extra-long routes. In the end, I realized that everything depends on the accelerator, since Benjamin does the rest.
[2025-04-09T15:43:03] Pandalgns: Guys @elvis08014 @jamessoderstrom @SmartRepair_NRW i have a easy a fast solution with the Police and limit the scooter 😂😂
[2025-04-09T15:46:21] Yamal: …..?
[2025-04-09T15:46:26] Yamal: XD
[2025-04-09T15:46:41] Yamal: 🤩
[2025-04-09T15:47:35] Pandalgns: Give me a second
[2025-04-09T15:47:36] Pandalgns: 😂😂
[2025-04-09T15:47:45] Pandalgns: I use qss4 display
[2025-04-09T15:47:49] Pandalgns: With script
[2025-04-09T15:48:09] Pandalgns: And limiting and unlimiting is super simple and very hidden.
[2025-04-09T15:48:09] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Pandalgns has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-04-09T15:51:06] Smart Repair: but only in connection with the display, right?
[2025-04-09T15:51:36] Pandalgns: Wait, I'll show you in a video
[2025-04-09T15:52:41] Pandalgns: <video_file>
[2025-04-09T15:53:03] Pandalgns: Sorry for my shitty English 😂😂
[2025-04-09T15:57:05] Smart Repair: Can the script be adapted to use the ppm input? And can you give different values to the front and rear motors?
[2025-04-09T15:59:52] Pandalgns: I don't know honestly, since I entered the script I didn't look at anything else about it, the truth is that I liked how it works and I left it like that and no, you can regulate the maximum speed and the phase amps of each mode but you can't put different values ​​for each motor since the display manages the primary controller and the secondary goes through the can obeying the parameters of the primary, anyway if you ask about the issue of loss of traction in the front wheel with respect to power, you can use the vesc traction control
[2025-04-09T16:08:03] Yamal: WoyoyoyyyyyyYYYYYYYYyyy 👍🤙
[2025-04-09T16:13:22] Yamal: Police in helicopter

[2025-04-09T20:42:52] Matthew: I know the 100/100 alu lite ubox says 100... I was just wondering if a bit more than 100amps is ok for battery amps so that the controller has a better time getting up to 100amps per motor phase????
[2025-04-09T20:45:33] Yamal: …why white, my temp sensor is red…
[2025-04-09T20:46:18] Yamal: Now I'm confused, but the manufacturer marked it separately in red as the temperature...
[2025-04-09T20:46:55] Yamal: <photos/photo_22539@09-04-2025_20-46-55.jpg>
[2025-04-09T20:47:02] Matthew: Oh, I mean like 55 battery amp per motor as example
[2025-04-09T20:47:39] Yamal: I hope everything is okay …..

[2025-04-09T21:46:33] Yamal: I made the mistake of following the colors the motors came in. However, I'm going to ask the manufacturer if the red wire on the motor is actually a temperature wire.

[2025-04-10T20:19:20] Smart Repair: The brake isn't that important. You can use a magnetic contact or a remote control. Will you use UART to communicate with the VESC?
[2025-04-10T20:24:07] Paolo ⁭: What vesc? What motor?

[2025-04-10T20:46:20] yoann tsobanoglou: Wanted to share progress on project build. Trying to adjust led to trigger speed effect and change color with duty cycle and also secondary script to handle brake lights with adc
[2025-04-10T20:47:28] yoann tsobanoglou: LispBM is very limited in terms of math availability but we can still have fun
[2025-04-10T20:54:18] haku: no lol
[2025-04-10T20:59:01] yoann tsobanoglou: Can communication for me is easier- the goal is to have the trigger quick and accessible when the moment comes(imagine police pushes you off the scooter and holds you). And if you want the script to be universal, you have to accept that people might not have the ability to install magnetic contact. So having it triggered by using a sequence of actions( like pulling the brake 5times in 3 seconds) is an option

[2025-04-11T11:00:04] Yamal: I think not,,, I mean “normal”
[2025-04-11T11:00:07] Yamal: Don’t know ..

[2025-04-11T15:52:04] Mirko Boni: Thank you
[2025-04-11T15:53:03] Jason: it's like serial number but it's really tied to your controller
[2025-04-11T15:53:11] Jason: not changeable unless you change the mcu
[2025-04-11T15:53:46] Jason: serial number is changeable but UID aint
[2025-04-11T15:53:53] Jason: (without hardware change)
[2025-04-11T15:54:53] Smart Repair: Yes, but you won't have a taillight and brake light. For that, you'll need an ESP or ADC module.
[2025-04-11T15:55:07] Yamal: I changed a letter in my serial number so I could access the Segway app.
[2025-04-11T15:55:27] Paolo ⁭: It's basically "serial Id" of the microprocessor
[2025-04-11T15:55:55] Smart Repair: and I would go directly to adc1/2 with throttle and brake. Better and cleaner than using Dash.
[2025-04-11T15:56:43] Yamal: Where I find it Chef?
[2025-04-11T16:15:02] Paolo ⁭: Idk if it's compativle with scooterhacking

[2025-04-11T22:10:35] skrtt: Im thinking of a 30s9p (molicel p45b) c700/x12 and 80h lonnyo
[2025-04-11T22:11:55] haku: this is california. need to bring your own bag
[2025-04-11T22:13:38] skrtt: So basically if u guys have no budget what would u do in a t3 with elongated deck and controllers on the outside for cooling and to fit more cells inside
[2025-04-11T22:15:43] Noname: Real men don't use bags. When hands are full your done shopping

[2025-04-11T22:27:36] Yamal: Sonken frame.?
[2025-04-11T22:27:43] skrtt: Yes
[2025-04-11T22:28:48] skrtt: Im convincing him to just get the rfp deck and sonken arms. No need to spend 3k and rfp deck is bigger by 4cm if im not mistaken
[2025-04-11T22:38:43] Dualtron Achilleus: You make custom size for the price of 100€
[2025-04-11T22:39:05] Dualtron Achilleus: Its just a single aluminiun u shape
[2025-04-11T22:40:05] Dualtron Achilleus: Crazy project btw
[2025-04-11T22:40:47] skrtt: He wants to spend the moneeeyy. And its also easier to just pay for it
[2025-04-11T22:44:40] Yamal: 4 no, around 15cm
[2025-04-11T22:46:26] skrtt: 62,5 vs 58
[2025-04-11T22:58:00] Yamal: I think is more
[2025-04-11T22:59:13] Yamal: <photos/photo_22593@11-04-2025_22-59-13.jpg>
[2025-04-11T23:03:15] Yamal: Nice project
[2025-04-11T23:04:40] skrtt: I was talking about the length inside the deck and i was comparing rfp deck to fastride deck
[2025-04-11T23:06:15] Yamal: I mean dt thunder frame vs rfp
[2025-04-11T23:09:11] Dualtron Achilleus: I made a700 mm for 110 buck haha
[2025-04-11T23:10:04] Dualtron Achilleus: 30s i crazy
[2025-04-11T23:10:23] Yamal: I also think and believe that rfp/ragemechanic frame is better than sonken
[2025-04-11T23:11:24] Dualtron Achilleus: Depend what alu they use
[2025-04-11T23:11:55] Dualtron Achilleus: I asked rfp what aluminium he use je say je did know
[2025-04-11T23:12:40] Dualtron Achilleus: I think its 1015
[2025-04-11T23:13:17] Yamal: I'm not referring to the material, but to the design.
[2025-04-11T23:13:41] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah sur also
[2025-04-11T23:15:21] Yamal: I remember Sonken Frame as fat, taller, and I don't really know where and how the controllers are anchored.
[2025-04-11T23:18:34] Yamal: Sonken swingarms are cool but expensive...
[2025-04-11T23:27:40] Yamal: Which esc..?
[2025-04-11T23:28:08] Yamal: I'm watching it, it's crazy xD

[2025-04-11T23:50:47] Face de Pin Sucé: Front and rear parts are 25mm, so you remove 50mm and you have usable length
[2025-04-11T23:51:53] skrtt: Nice
[2025-04-11T23:52:04] skrtt: Gonna discuss that tomorrow with him
[2025-04-11T23:52:18] Face de Pin Sucé: Anyway, if he takes from RFP or from us it's okay
[2025-04-11T23:52:24] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't buy from FastRide

[2025-04-11T23:53:19] skrtt: Why tho?
[2025-04-11T23:53:30] Face de Pin Sucé: This is shit too, complicated to install, bad design inside, strong but bad design
[2025-04-11T23:53:42] Face de Pin Sucé: And also it keeps the base pole of dualtron
[2025-04-11T23:53:53] Face de Pin Sucé: <video_file>
[2025-04-11T23:54:09] Yamal: Also 24h?

[2025-04-12T01:56:29] Noname: Ratchet one sucks. Buy manual
[2025-04-12T01:57:48] Eduuuuuuuuu: ok thanks
[2025-04-12T01:58:41] Noname: You can't adjust it enough and mine was crushing cable sheath and not crimping wire. Also very sharp edges. Manual one you crimp wire then sheath. Takes longer but you get a feel for it and is way better. Also hard to see connector in the other one
[2025-04-12T03:40:08] haku: Noname i forced those threads in like a heathen dog. no ifs and buts.
[2025-04-12T03:40:19] haku: it is 3/8 just needs a little lube

[2025-04-12T03:41:53] haku: that bolt is hardened steel
[2025-04-12T03:42:47] Noname: Wide base against flat it's more tension to brake. Skinny nut it's more of a sheer point
[2025-04-12T03:43:23] haku: 90% completion on project. just need to follow spinny diagram.on spintend page
[2025-04-12T03:43:44] Noname: Ride tmrw

[2025-04-12T23:57:26] Noname: 50/50 vs 70/30 throttle

[2025-04-12T23:59:30] Yamal: I hope to be able to do some route before leaving on my trip
[2025-04-13T00:00:20] Noname: Dammit
[2025-04-13T00:00:43] haku: you should have snowmobiles by now
[2025-04-13T00:01:20] Noname: I hate snowmobiles
[2025-04-13T00:01:27] haku: once it snowed hard where i use to live here in vegas. guy was on a snowmobile in the streets. hilarious
[2025-04-13T00:01:41] Noname: Plus there isn't quite enough to use them was a sad but cold winter
[2025-04-13T00:01:47] haku: never ridden one
[2025-04-13T00:01:53] Noname: Plenty
[2025-04-13T00:02:26] Noname: Outside winter sports is a no go for me
[2025-04-13T00:02:53] Jan: So 33x2 with N55 it is
[2025-04-13T00:03:00] haku: my dog would love that weather. right now hes sad because he has to walk at night
[2025-04-13T00:03:22] Yamal: But the truth is I'm pretty busy, between moving and painting, when I return it will be more difficult to escape with the motorcycle, but there's always a window of good luck, so I'll go out in search of adventure and adrenaline, just keep the insulin spikes low.
[2025-04-13T00:03:25] Noname: Send him to visit uncle noname
[2025-04-13T00:03:28] haku: i rather have layers of clothes than cooking
[2025-04-13T00:03:31] Jan: 40% more field strength but where to get the magnets is another question
[2025-04-13T00:04:03] Noname: <animation>
[2025-04-13T00:04:38] haku: dehydration or pnemonia. both are slow deaths
[2025-04-13T00:05:32] Yamal: you need wheels with spikes
[2025-04-13T00:06:30] Noname: It's melting earth was warming then hit with snow again

[2025-04-13T00:10:16] Noname: More north but some have been around this area
[2025-04-13T00:10:44] Yamal: Tesla, luxury neighborhood, coils enough to make a 3D house, a luxury gym at home, spa + sauna, Mexican women preparing burritos, vesc controllers, molicel cells I don't know... there's still something that doesn't add up.
[2025-04-13T00:10:54] Yamal: Crazy…
[2025-04-13T00:12:01] haku: what are you talking about. tent life and no ac boy
[2025-04-13T00:12:09] Noname: Is that the Haku signature series cell holder pink?
[2025-04-13T00:12:35] haku: yes it is. i call it las vegas caucassian pink
[2025-04-13T00:13:14] Noname: Keep your zipper up and it won't turn pink in the sun
[2025-04-13T00:13:31] haku: no glamorous tans. you turn pink and red. true story
[2025-04-13T00:14:17] haku: not orange. like 47. pink
[2025-04-13T00:15:06] Noname: That sounds horrific
[2025-04-13T00:15:21] Noname: I haven't felt warmth in 6 months
[2025-04-13T00:15:27] Noname: Send me some
[2025-04-13T00:15:58] Yamal: Is it cheap to have things shipped from north to south?
[2025-04-13T00:16:06] haku: get a electric heater. cheaper than ac
[2025-04-13T00:17:14] Noname: Yes envy is cheap, owning or doing the things you envy is costly
[2025-04-13T00:17:31] haku: hahaha

[2025-04-13T00:19:37] Yamal: But we have to many different company’s
[2025-04-13T00:19:42] haku: can you ship batteries local post or you have to label it?
[2025-04-13T00:19:59] Noname: Label and ground shipping
[2025-04-13T00:20:58] haku: federal crime if you ship a 20s10p battery without label?
[2025-04-13T00:21:58] Yamal: If it is welded with copper I imagine not
[2025-04-13T00:23:28] Yamal: If the police stop you and ask you to show them what's in the box, you can always show them the video
[2025-04-13T00:27:06] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-04-13T00:29:36] haku: im living off samples yamal. not too glamorous.
[2025-04-13T00:30:40] Yamal: Protein

[2025-04-13T00:30:46] haku: i cant buy real meat and eggs
[2025-04-13T00:30:49] Yamal: But is from milk?
[2025-04-13T00:31:08] haku: yes whey is derived from milk. excess stuff from cheese
[2025-04-13T00:31:33] Yamal: O mean look like from meat
[2025-04-13T00:31:44] Yamal: But yes whey protein the best
[2025-04-13T00:31:45] haku: why is this stuff even expensive. its waste from cheese

[2025-04-13T00:32:34] Yamal: Before married
[2025-04-13T00:32:54] haku: i remember the good old days when a big tub of whey is less than 20$
[2025-04-13T00:33:29] haku: now all supplements after biden tripled in price. i had to cut it off
[2025-04-13T00:33:36] Noname: Prob fine unless catch fire then your cooked
[2025-04-13T00:34:36] haku: preworkouts back then had meth dammit. different chemical structure but same effect. they banned it
[2025-04-13T00:35:43] haku: are cylindrical batteries okay in fast changing elevation? or they explode?
[2025-04-13T00:36:39] Noname: Like on a plane? Just can't pull over in a plane quickly
[2025-04-13T00:36:49] haku: yes like a plane
[2025-04-13T00:37:05] Noname: Yeah a truck can pull over if there's a fire
[2025-04-13T00:37:24] Noname: Plane crashes
[2025-04-13T00:37:43] haku: okay. i will not commit federal crime. thats bad
[2025-04-13T00:38:14] haku: but my batteries will not burst into flames.
[2025-04-13T00:38:40] Noname: Planes have a wh limit. Like drill battery is cool a 5kw fireball isnt

[2025-04-13T00:44:56] haku: did not skip legday or just blessed genetics
[2025-04-13T00:45:33] haku: when you get married and kids that lifestyle is done son
[2025-04-13T00:46:03] haku: no more bitches and beaches
[2025-04-13T00:46:06] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-04-13T00:46:14] Noname: Custom make
[2025-04-13T00:48:31] haku: this was me before getting married at 7 then divorced at 10
[2025-04-13T00:48:44] haku: i had my boy when i was 5
[2025-04-13T00:48:45] Yamal: Hahaha
[2025-04-13T00:49:01] haku: oh shit my math is wrong
[2025-04-13T00:51:22] haku: you need that fancy magnetizer machine from china
[2025-04-13T00:53:09] Yamal: Nice photo
[2025-04-13T00:53:19] Jan: N54 would be nice
[2025-04-13T00:55:37] Noname: What in motors now?
[2025-04-13T00:55:47] haku: my first 1911. just kidding i dont even know if thats real. 1911s are heavy boys.
[2025-04-13T00:56:12] Noname: Is it worth it to get the absolute strongest price vs benefit
[2025-04-13T00:56:12] haku: or i might be swole since day 1 yamal
[2025-04-13T00:57:07] Noname: Had child out of wedlock, story checks out
[2025-04-13T00:57:25] Yamal: Beautiful memories, 7 years have passed as if they were 15 minutes xD
[2025-04-13T00:58:41] Yamal: It's time to get stronger than ever
[2025-04-13T00:59:32] haku: just to let you know. dont want to burst your bubble but testostorone goes down with age
[2025-04-13T00:59:43] haku: you need to supplement to counter that
[2025-04-13T01:05:23] Yamal: Training supplements are good, but I never start taking them until there is a certain intensity and continuity in the training. It is also good after taking them for a period of time, to make the body more sensitive and receptive to them
[2025-04-13T01:06:39] Yamal: But nothing too crazy, the usual: protein/casein protein for sleep, creatine, BCAAs, omega-3 pearls, multivitamins
[2025-04-13T01:06:50] haku: good stuff
[2025-04-13T01:07:29] Yamal: And the most I took was tribulus terrestris, a natural testosterone booster
[2025-04-13T01:07:32] haku: im talking about the "other" supplements. the way of the needle
[2025-04-13T01:07:50] haku: needle in the butt cheeks
[2025-04-13T01:08:22] Yamal: Never! xD, it's not necessary
[2025-04-13T01:09:19] haku: i want to look like robert kennedy jr when i reach his age. swole af
[2025-04-13T01:10:11] Yamal: I've had a family that's very into the gym, and they've always done it naturally. Are you going to compete or make a living from it? ^^ Testosterone cycles are crazy, just like the growth hormone.
[2025-04-13T01:12:00] Yamal: With the growth hormone, the body's organs grow and if you have something wrong with you, you're a corpse. Of course, bodybuilders who use it undergo tests and checkups.
[2025-04-13T01:14:27] Yamal: Something I've never tried is electrolytes. It's all about being in shape, sport is health, and if you really want to look good, in my opinion it's better to focus a little on definition if you have volume, rather than on overeating and lifting weights.
[2025-04-13T01:14:45] haku: true. growth hormone is always good. but testosterone needs to be cycled right.
[2025-04-13T01:14:56] haku: gatorade bro
[2025-04-13T01:15:33] haku: pedialyte also has it. i take it back then after cutting for weigh ins
[2025-04-13T01:16:41] haku: cut from 180 to 155 or 159lbs in 1 day
[2025-04-13T01:29:52] haku: see that ripped back yamal! christmas tree right there
[2025-04-13T01:29:53] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-04-13T01:34:32] Noname: Uh one of those dishwasher shaped vehicles is in my way
[2025-04-13T01:34:44] haku: what a hater
[2025-04-13T01:35:22] haku: that is one piece of complex machinery boy
[2025-04-13T01:35:45] haku: battery+esc+motor
[2025-04-13T01:41:48] Jan: We should try
[2025-04-13T01:57:30] Patrick: Would more motor poles make sense then?
[2025-04-13T01:57:38] Patrick: Gives us a even better magnetic field
[2025-04-13T01:57:57] Patrick: Combined with curved magnets
[2025-04-13T01:58:19] Patrick: Would lower the kV even more
[2025-04-13T02:06:26] Patrick: Isnt more poles better for esc for tracking though?
[2025-04-13T02:09:42] Noname: I never used it it's complicated and just weird in the hand
[2025-04-13T02:10:23] Patrick: Then you also need to find sweetspot there for efficiency i guess?
[2025-04-13T03:03:16] Jason: I just prefer traditional throttle
[2025-04-13T03:13:26] Noname: I like my 300x thumb throttle for scooter otherwise ebikes have whatever twist throttle they came with
[2025-04-13T03:13:38] Jason: mmm
[2025-04-13T03:13:53] Jason: I prefer thumb throttle tbh in general
[2025-04-13T03:14:02] Jason: twist when long cruise
[2025-04-13T03:14:46] Noname: You need thumb on a scooter twist doesn't work standing
[2025-04-13T03:39:54] haku: spinny is for the elegant rides boys. control is amazing
[2025-04-13T03:40:19] haku: one hand controls and riding is good
[2025-04-13T03:40:46] haku: disclaimer. i already broke one
[2025-04-13T07:32:59] Yamal: Surron trottle!!
[2025-04-13T07:33:20] Yamal: Sunday lest gOoo!!!!!!!!!
[2025-04-13T07:33:24] Yamal: 😂

[2025-04-13T07:52:34] Jason: rebuilding
[2025-04-13T07:56:04] Jason: only shitass steel one got rusted fortunately
[2025-04-13T07:57:26] Jason: <photos/photo_22639@13-04-2025_07-57-26.jpg>
[2025-04-13T07:57:27] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jason has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-04-13T08:03:19] Yamal: For make battery ?
[2025-04-13T08:03:44] Yamal: Your Ninebot still working ,,?
[2025-04-13T08:41:47] Yamal: Daniel can get back his e-scooters ? Lima one etc ,,?
[2025-04-13T09:01:06] Yamal: <video_file>
[2025-04-13T09:01:49] Yamal: Lol I see now
[2025-04-13T09:01:49] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-04-13T09:06:27] Unknown: how bad is starting when your motor doenst have halls
[2025-04-13T09:07:18] Noname: Roll it forward and it starts
[2025-04-13T09:08:18] Noname: It's no trouble at all
[2025-04-13T09:08:45] Unknown: just starting from complete 0 its ass?
[2025-04-13T09:09:45] Jason: yes
[2025-04-13T09:10:25] Yamal: I lost this .. don’t know when
[2025-04-13T09:10:27] Jason: you can use hfi or vss
[2025-04-13T09:10:38] Jason: starting from 0 sometimes works and sometimes not
[2025-04-13T09:11:00] Yamal: <photos/photo_22640@13-04-2025_09-11-00.jpg>
[2025-04-13T11:33:52] Grex: Teverun Power🤟🏻💪🏻
[2025-04-13T11:48:13] Medhi Cantin: Yes 🦾
[2025-04-13T12:10:38] Yamal: @XgunaX how are you and your projects ,,?
[2025-04-13T13:46:42] Pandalgns: Guys, does anyone know how much amperage comes out of the 12v aux connector of an MKS 84200hp controller?
[2025-04-13T13:47:12] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_22642@13-04-2025_13-47-12.jpg>
[2025-04-13T13:56:03] Yamal: <video_file>
[2025-04-13T14:48:45] Dualtron Achilleus: Lon’yo use n38h
[2025-04-13T14:50:17] Patrick: Hfi 0 start trash
[2025-04-13T14:50:29] Patrick: Above 0km/h works though
[2025-04-13T14:50:39] Patrick: No need for halls really
[2025-04-13T14:50:55] Patrick: 0 start sucks anyways
[2025-04-13T14:51:16] Patrick: Yea vss works best
[2025-04-13T14:51:26] Patrick: But also sucks from 0km/h
[2025-04-13T14:51:37] Patrick: It just makes this weird sound
[2025-04-13T14:53:24] Patrick: For me 0 start dangerous anyways
[2025-04-13T14:53:44] Patrick: You accidentally press the throttle while pushing the scooter and it flies away.
[2025-04-13T15:00:23] Dualtron Achilleus: Someone amready changed the magnet jere
[2025-04-13T15:00:32] Dualtron Achilleus: Already
[2025-04-13T15:01:04] Patrick: On 65H?
[2025-04-13T15:01:57] Dualtron Achilleus: Everything
[2025-04-13T15:02:28] GABE: what temp for 37/63 on mp2?
[2025-04-13T15:02:43] Patrick: ?
[2025-04-13T15:02:47] Patrick: Fet temp or
[2025-04-13T15:02:52] GABE: Leaded
[2025-04-13T15:02:55] GABE: for fets sure
[2025-04-13T15:03:00] GABE: can I do those instead of phases first?
[2025-04-13T15:03:18] Patrick: Ah used like 200°C on hotplate for leaded solder when doing busbars
[2025-04-13T15:03:36] Patrick: Yea do fets before please
[2025-04-13T15:03:43] GABE: I'll use a 6gauge strand
[2025-04-13T15:03:45] Patrick: Otherwise very annoying
[2025-04-13T15:04:07] Patrick: 8awg battery & 3x 12awg for phase is the best on mp2
[2025-04-13T15:04:15] GABE: So wait
[2025-04-13T15:04:28] GABE: the very first thing I do is fets
[2025-04-13T15:04:35] GABE: Or the copper bar
[2025-04-13T15:04:57] GABE: Nah for the busbars man
[2025-04-13T15:05:38] Patrick: Thierry his mp2
[2025-04-13T15:05:38] Patrick: <photos/photo_22644@13-04-2025_15-05-38.jpg>
[2025-04-13T15:05:39] Patrick: <photos/photo_22645@13-04-2025_15-05-39.jpg>
[2025-04-13T15:05:55] Patrick: First copper busbars
[2025-04-13T15:05:58] Patrick: Then fets
[2025-04-13T15:06:04] Patrick: And after fets are done you do phase wires
[2025-04-13T15:09:35] GABE: so no need for solder on the fet side
[2025-04-13T15:10:01] GABE: <photos/photo_22646@13-04-2025_15-10-01.jpg>
[2025-04-13T15:10:17] GABE: 6awg would be too big for it no?
[2025-04-13T15:10:53] Patrick: 8awg enough
[2025-04-13T15:10:59] Patrick: But yea 6awg probably too big
[2025-04-13T15:11:08] Patrick: Good luck anyways busbars suck the heat away
[2025-04-13T15:11:24] Patrick: I have 3mm once and strong soldering iron and well
[2025-04-13T15:11:34] Patrick: Yea those already take away the heat like crazy
[2025-04-13T15:11:34] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Patrick has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-04-13T15:11:47] GABE: 100w iron enough?
[2025-04-13T15:12:38] GABE: could use a jet to heat up the strand beforehand
[2025-04-13T15:12:54] GABE: along with the hob plate
[2025-04-13T15:13:27] GABE: if there's too little air in the strand it would also suck balls no?
[2025-04-13T15:13:57] Yamal: <video_file>
[2025-04-13T15:14:02] Patrick: Uh could be hard with normal size busbars would work so 2-3mm thick busbars more then enough
[2025-04-13T15:14:20] Patrick: Just remember that youre fets will limit you
[2025-04-13T15:14:23] Yamal: <video_file>
[2025-04-13T15:14:30] Patrick: ?
[2025-04-13T15:14:43] GABE: Ehhh I just want 10kw per wheel
[2025-04-13T15:14:50] GABE: my cell more likely
[2025-04-13T15:14:57] Patrick: Stay with 8awg for battery and 3x 12awg per phase
[2025-04-13T15:15:20] Patrick: Dont make it too hard did the same and its just pain for assembly
[2025-04-13T15:16:03] Patrick: 3x 12awg is how much like ~10mm² per phase? But anyways its way more then the mp2 can even deliver
[2025-04-13T15:16:23] Patrick: Also try to reinforce mosfet legs
[2025-04-13T15:16:35] GABE: ugh I on got 10aug
[2025-04-13T15:16:38] GABE: so annoying
[2025-04-13T15:17:00] GABE: can I not just Tri split the 6awg
[2025-04-13T15:17:05] GABE: and feed in accordingly
[2025-04-13T15:17:05] Patrick: Will do the same just do the thierry way with fet legs
[2025-04-13T15:17:16] Patrick: 6awg on phase?
[2025-04-13T15:17:16] GABE: You mean it can push more power
[2025-04-13T15:17:23] GABE: Into 3 parts sure
[2025-04-13T15:17:24] GABE: bare
[2025-04-13T15:17:26] GABE: ?
[2025-04-13T15:17:34] GABE: feed in naked
[2025-04-13T15:17:34] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-04-13T15:17:37] Jason: I put no dm in bio just cause I kept getting
[2025-04-13T15:17:38] Jason: aaaa
[2025-04-13T15:17:48] Jason: 2 in a row in different platform ffs
[2025-04-13T15:17:53] Jason: <photos/photo_22647@13-04-2025_15-17-53.jpg>
[2025-04-13T15:17:54] Patrick: Yea with reinforced legs i guess, but would test where to place ntc then
[2025-04-13T15:18:00] Patrick: Not that package overheats then
[2025-04-13T15:18:02] Jason: let me kill myself real quick
[2025-04-13T15:18:17] Jason: lets listen to night brain yapping about everything
[2025-04-13T15:18:24] Patrick: Whos leasor
[2025-04-13T15:18:28] Jason: idk
[2025-04-13T15:18:46] Jason: I have 0 fucking idea why people contact me instead of yall who group ordered mp2 in the first place
[2025-04-13T15:19:07] Jason: do research on your own fuck
[2025-04-13T15:19:08] Patrick: Idk there is even a question channel for mp2 group order
[2025-04-13T15:19:23] Jason: you should let everyone who bought know bout that channel
[2025-04-13T15:19:44] Patrick: They all are in the channel🫠
[2025-04-13T15:19:52] GABE: could I just use 1x 10awg a phase?
[2025-04-13T15:20:02] GABE: if I fit it in
[2025-04-13T15:20:03] Patrick: Yea but please not 6awg
[2025-04-13T15:20:26] GABE: I realized making em not so difficult
[2025-04-13T15:20:27] Patrick: 10awg little annoying in my opinion already
[2025-04-13T15:20:36] GABE: You can make any wire fit
[2025-04-13T15:20:39] GABE: even 6awg
[2025-04-13T15:20:52] GABE: Just strip off the outside circumference strand
[2025-04-13T15:21:10] Patrick: Yea until you fuck up and you accidently bridge fet legs together
[2025-04-13T15:21:15] Patrick: Then have fun unsoldering
[2025-04-13T15:21:16] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-04-13T15:21:19] Jason: lol
[2025-04-13T15:21:25] Jason: 2x or 3x 12awg is perfect
[2025-04-13T15:21:27] Jason: or 10
[2025-04-13T15:21:34] Patrick: Big wire + busbar + unsoldering
[2025-04-13T15:21:37] Jason: tbh mp2 ain't strong enough to torture those ztrands
[2025-04-13T15:21:47] Patrick: Yea will do the 3x 12awg like thierry did
[2025-04-13T15:21:48] Jason: I'm gonna sell my mp2 to someone someday
[2025-04-13T15:21:56] Jason: and use my 12fet toll
[2025-04-13T15:22:08] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-04-13T15:22:21] GABE: what temp can the mp2 take on a plate?
[2025-04-13T15:22:24] GABE: Before dying
[2025-04-13T15:22:27] Jason: what
[2025-04-13T15:22:34] Patrick: Idk did 200°C
[2025-04-13T15:22:43] Jason: on hotplate it's fine
[2025-04-13T15:22:44] Patrick: Caps didnt die
[2025-04-13T15:22:47] Jason: just don't fuck components
[2025-04-13T15:22:56] Jason: but don't do same to electrolytic
[2025-04-13T15:23:00] Jason: mlcc is fine
[2025-04-13T15:23:05] Jason: electrolytic? uhhh
[2025-04-13T15:23:21] Patrick: Ah mlcc different temps?
[2025-04-13T15:23:38] Patrick: Btw there are different fet drivers for mp2 would it make sense to try the other once
[2025-04-13T15:24:32] GABE: Wait I could just put it in the oven
[2025-04-13T15:24:41] GABE: safer then
[2025-04-13T15:24:43] GABE: Than hob
[2025-04-13T15:24:48] Patrick: Kitchen oven?
[2025-04-13T15:24:53] GABE: i mean yeah
[2025-04-13T15:24:58] GABE: it has temp settings
[2025-04-13T15:25:02] GABE: think someone here done it that way
[2025-04-13T15:25:05] Patrick: 🫠 Not Sure if temp controll is that great
[2025-04-13T15:25:13] GABE: Better than hob which is 500
[2025-04-13T15:25:15] Patrick: Also idk if i want lead fumes in my oven
[2025-04-13T15:25:16] GABE: apparently
[2025-04-13T15:25:26] GABE: Nah like pop it out and work on it
[2025-04-13T15:25:47] Jason: I tried 2
[2025-04-13T15:25:53] Jason: both fine still
[2025-04-13T15:25:58] Patrick: What even the difference?
[2025-04-13T15:26:01] Jason: idk
[2025-04-13T15:26:03] Jason: none
[2025-04-13T15:26:08] Patrick: Whats the improvement
[2025-04-13T15:26:13] Jason: idk none
[2025-04-13T15:26:18] Jason: all same
[2025-04-13T15:26:19] Jason: 2
[2025-04-13T15:26:35] Jason: One was from st
[2025-04-13T15:26:42] Jason: other one was from uhh lemme chek
[2025-04-13T15:26:42] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jason has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-04-13T15:27:09] Patrick: Uh yea not important then
[2025-04-13T15:29:05] Jason: other one is IR2181S
[2025-04-13T15:29:32] Jason: one was L6498DTR
[2025-04-13T15:37:59] Pandalgns: Woooow take a mcflurry for me 😂😂😂
[2025-04-13T16:08:54] Rose: Hey there Tee, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-04-13T16:25:19] skrtt: U dont have 1€ burguers????
[2025-04-13T16:33:11] Pandalgns: Now at McDonald's they don't cost 1 euro 😂😂 they cost 1.45
[2025-04-13T16:49:07] skrtt: I just checked now… they dont cost 1€ anymore. Eurosavings my ass
[2025-04-13T17:02:58] Noname: Mine shutters. It's not like a stock g30 where you have to push 1mph the slightest forward movement and your off. Are you buying motors with no halls. It's not a big deal try it
[2025-04-13T17:25:38] Unknown: i may i dont know yet
[2025-04-13T18:08:25] Paolo ⁭: There's no significant difference, already did custom order with different magnet
[2025-04-13T18:08:48] Paolo ⁭: Definitely not worth the money I spent rofl
[2025-04-13T18:09:25] Paolo ⁭: would be better if you can find better stator core
[2025-04-13T18:15:05] Patrick: Wasnt the kV way lower?

[2025-04-13T19:59:43] Unknown: Can anyone help me. Why does the front motor like lag when I accelerate and randomly stop and start to spin?
[2025-04-13T19:59:49] Unknown: <video_file>
[2025-04-13T20:06:32] Yamal: Y0000
[2025-04-13T20:06:49] Yamal: Dual 85/240???? 🤩
[2025-04-13T20:07:57] Yamal: How did the engine detection go?
[2025-04-13T20:19:40] Unknown: 1 is 85250 and one is 85240
[2025-04-13T20:19:51] Unknown: it went fine but the rear one spassed a bit
[2025-04-13T20:19:55] Roby MacGyver: I think 3A
[2025-04-13T20:20:03] Unknown: but it said 160A for rear and 144 for front
[2025-04-13T20:20:17] Unknown: could it be because the hall sensors dont work for the front motor?
[2025-04-13T20:20:47] Noname: Adc2 to 3.3v on switch works for button operated regen/brake?
[2025-04-13T20:21:51] Roby MacGyver: yes
[2025-04-13T20:22:03] Unknown: oh yea and my button wont work correctly
[2025-04-13T20:23:12] Unknown: when using the 1k resistor it wont even work in any way but without it. its works but after a short period of time it just begins beeping really fast and turning the light on and off
[2025-04-13T20:24:39] Yamal: Aauuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
[2025-04-13T20:24:46] Yamal: Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh

[2025-04-13T21:29:34] Finn: Watch out for the bend radius on the legs
[2025-04-13T21:30:16] Yamal: Amazing controller
[2025-04-13T21:31:06] Yamal: But why 3x3 cables for the phases, and how much it costs to solder them to the bullets,,
[2025-04-13T21:35:24] Finn: Now i want to make an mp2 😭
[2025-04-13T21:35:58] Patrick: You only had 2 pcbs right?
[2025-04-13T21:36:09] Finn: Yeah sold it to your collegue
[2025-04-13T21:36:32] Finn: pro2 times, arround 1,5 Years ago
[2025-04-13T21:37:24] Finn: Maybe 85240 in the front and mp2 in the back and 20s
[2025-04-13T21:37:47] Patrick: Why mp2 at the rear?
[2025-04-13T21:38:00] Finn: Front doesnt need that much current
[2025-04-13T21:38:05] Finn: mostly slips anyways
[2025-04-13T21:38:07] Patrick: Isnt 85240 stronger
[2025-04-13T21:38:13] Finn: you sure?
[2025-04-13T21:38:26] Finn: thought you c an push 400A phase on mp2
[2025-04-13T21:38:42] Patrick: I think so noone tried mp2 for this much currents i guess if legs are reinforced it can handle more but would check package temp
[2025-04-13T21:39:05] Patrick: 420A ist Hardware protection already
[2025-04-13T21:39:31] Finn: Oh
[2025-04-13T21:39:42] Finn: I just want to build one and not use it haha
[2025-04-13T21:40:01] Finn: If it works, cool, if not ill fix it and sell it
[2025-04-13T21:40:30] Patrick: I mean mp2 is cheap and reliable if build propper from what i saw
[2025-04-13T21:40:36] Hackintoshhhh: No
[2025-04-13T21:40:39] Hackintoshhhh: way worse
[2025-04-13T21:40:43] Hackintoshhhh: logic is horrid
[2025-04-13T21:40:51] Finn: Yeah. If you make a order or have some spare boards left over ill take 1-2
[2025-04-13T21:41:01] Patrick: Since when 12fet toll worse the 18fet to220?
[2025-04-13T21:41:03] Hackintoshhhh: same shit layout like 100100
[2025-04-13T21:41:19] Hackintoshhhh: 12v dying for no reason
[2025-04-13T21:41:26] Hackintoshhhh: unreliable azfuck
[2025-04-13T21:41:37] Finn: Do you still sell your mp2 stuff?
[2025-04-13T21:41:53] Finn: 1x MP2 assembled und 1x MP2 PCB und 1x Pill pcb
[2025-04-13T22:13:49] Hackintoshhhh: Yeah i do but i took the stm off the pill to check smth
[2025-04-13T22:13:56] Hackintoshhhh: ill solder it again tho
[2025-04-13T23:24:35] Yamal: Does anyone know where to get the plastic support to lower the fender height on the G2?
[2025-04-14T00:31:14] haku: recreated return of the jedi 1 to 1
[2025-04-14T00:50:08] Eren: <video_file>
[2025-04-14T00:56:26] cihan: What's the best way to print a battery holder bigger than the max print size of 3D printer? How should it be printed so that connected parts are almost as rigid as a monolithic print?
[2025-04-14T01:01:36] haku: glue with plastic epoxy
[2025-04-14T01:02:46] 'lekrsu': In a zig zag pattern from top and bottom layers: - half length, full length, full length, (repeat until desired length), half length
[2025-04-14T01:02:59] Yamal: Dual g2 ? 17/4 22/3 33/2 ?
[2025-04-14T01:03:09] Yamal: What do you think
[2025-04-14T01:03:30] haku: single 17x4
[2025-04-14T01:03:55] Yamal: Always I like monster
[2025-04-14T01:04:21] Yamal: Talking with Chinese xD..
[2025-04-14T01:04:27] 'lekrsu': Then tightly wrapped with glass fiber tape at least once on cell sides.
[2025-04-14T01:05:03] Yamal: Your top speed ?(hello ^^’)
[2025-04-14T01:05:47] Yamal: Why 100/100 85/240 powerful..
[2025-04-14T01:06:59] 'lekrsu': Didn't exist so I made this https://makerworld.com/models/1191272, however hard to insert the metal cylinders, and fender can move somewhat freely back&fourth if pressed.
[2025-04-14T01:07:19] 'lekrsu': Used it for a while until I disassembled my Monorim.
[2025-04-14T01:07:40] cihan: Thanks. You print some more filament over 2 parts to connect them? Did I understand correctly? I'll appreciate it if you have a photo of it.
[2025-04-14T01:07:47] 'lekrsu': 65 km/h or so, 17x4.
[2025-04-14T01:08:33] cihan: I couldn't really understand this one.
[2025-04-14T01:08:50] 'lekrsu': Not any extra plates no, James printed my last spacer and it was cut up like this.
[2025-04-14T01:09:37] Noname: So the slice of parts isn't directly over another slice
[2025-04-14T01:10:11] 'lekrsu': <photos/photo_22652@14-04-2025_01-10-11.jpg>
[2025-04-14T01:10:53] Yamal: Why
[2025-04-14T01:10:55] 'lekrsu': Staggered so the cut isn't above another cut.
[2025-04-14T01:11:10] Yamal: Really change ,,?
[2025-04-14T01:11:18] Noname: Trying to design a holder is fucking pissing me off. I now have anxiety today
[2025-04-14T01:14:58] haku: plastic jb weld. holders will break first before the crease breaks
[2025-04-14T01:15:37] haku: hold it down with mini clamps
[2025-04-14T01:16:23] 'lekrsu': If I didn't change working systems then what else is there to do 🥹
[2025-04-14T01:17:22] 'lekrsu': <photos/photo_22654@14-04-2025_01-17-22.jpg>
[2025-04-14T01:17:25] Yamal: …
[2025-04-14T01:18:06] 'lekrsu': God tier fender position
[2025-04-14T01:20:34] Yamal: I mean monorin
[2025-04-14T01:20:57] 'lekrsu': I know, it's just, I wanted to, so.

[2025-04-14T14:14:51] Pandalgns: 170mm/ 3mm ❤️

[2025-04-14T14:40:42] Mirono escooters: 3mm is sooo much better then 2
[2025-04-14T14:47:26] Hackintoshhhh: Not for magura tho
[2025-04-14T14:47:52] Mirono escooters: I don't like maguras
[2025-04-14T14:47:59] Hackintoshhhh: What do you use?
[2025-04-14T14:48:02] Hackintoshhhh: Hope?
[2025-04-14T14:48:15] Mirono escooters: Not shitty plastic lever brakes that's for sure
[2025-04-14T14:48:40] Hackintoshhhh: That is true, i have saint levers for mine tho
[2025-04-14T14:48:46] Mirono escooters: I used the KOTTO brakes with 3mm disks on ebike, now I'm ebrake and drum cuz boring scoot
[2025-04-14T14:49:14] Hackintoshhhh: Magura caliper and saint lever i think best combo
[2025-04-14T14:49:37] Hackintoshhhh: Imo if you replace magura plastic lever with carbon lever it’s quite good too
[2025-04-14T14:50:01] Mirono escooters: Doesn't take 3mm tho?
[2025-04-14T14:50:02] Hackintoshhhh: But yeah each to their own liking that’s why we customise scoots in the first place
[2025-04-14T14:50:12] Pandalgns: My doubt is that they will fit my brake calipers 😅
[2025-04-14T14:50:13] Hackintoshhhh: Roschee says it can be done
[2025-04-14T14:50:23] Hackintoshhhh: But imo 2.05 is alr tricky
[2025-04-14T14:52:16] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I have always used the 160x3mm ones, the next ones I wanted to put these 170 ones
[2025-04-14T14:54:25] Pandalgns: Fuck
[2025-04-14T14:54:29] Pandalgns: I was undecided between 160 or 170 but since I now have a 160 I wanted to try a little bigger, the truth is that they look very good
[2025-04-14T15:06:32] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, I thought the same thing, apparently those 170s work well.
[2025-04-14T15:06:39] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <photos/photo_22664@14-04-2025_15-06-39.jpg>
[2025-04-14T15:23:28] Pandalgns: They probably won't fit thick enough in the brake caliper 😅😅
[2025-04-14T15:28:13] Eduuuuuuuuu: Thank you I already found it and they are not those, they are the JST PH.
[2025-04-14T16:08:01] Finn: Not sure what you mean
[2025-04-14T16:08:15] Finn: My magura has metal lever
[2025-04-14T16:09:47] haku: peak g30v2 blitzkrieg edition will be superior. bulletproof up to 9mm
[2025-04-14T16:16:59] Yamal: 🤙🥷
[2025-04-14T16:24:13] skrtt: Dont have
[2025-04-14T16:25:27] Mirono escooters: Yes, some have some special "carbon plastic" bullshit @jamessoderstrom
[2025-04-14T16:26:11] Mirono escooters: And still. Breaks so easily. I hate their levers. But yes, I know it's for mtb weight savings..
[2025-04-14T16:30:15] Patrick: Yes very important to save the 10 grams on a mtb
[2025-04-14T16:32:48] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: but plastic body
[2025-04-14T16:57:39] haku: this is why i dont use mine. plastic levers
[2025-04-14T17:12:05] Mirono escooters: Dad snapped it with his hands

[2025-04-15T22:39:26] Matthew: So, I'm confused with you saying you have one set to 5v and another set to 3.3v. I run adc 1 3.3v. I run it in mapping and just push and release throttle and then it's set and hit apply. The vesc will calculate center. So I'm confused on what you're even doing.
[2025-04-15T22:41:29] Matthew: The only other way I've seen is in adc1 options is current no reverse center i do believe. With that setting when you go under center then regen starts to activate.
[2025-04-15T23:04:47] Noname: It's not stock with that front end on it buddy

[2025-04-17T02:52:41] skrtt: At 84v
[2025-04-17T03:41:18] Jason: just saying

[2025-04-17T04:50:14] haku: he is always watching. prolly has a different name. he knows who the loyalists are and who the fardriver demons are
[2025-04-17T05:55:51] Matthew: I don't enter any values other than invert motor direction if it's spinning the wrong direction. I seriously just click reset, press the throttle and click apply.
[2025-04-17T06:01:25] Matthew: Also if it's brake from center as far as I understand is your throttle will activate the brake once below middle of the range. That if you want regen brakes handled when pressing the brake then you also need adc2 to be connected and mapped. You can have variable or button regen.
[2025-04-17T06:35:36] Matte: try different USB hub, do not plug it into the front of your pc, always at the back into the motherboard

[2025-04-17T07:43:08] Yamal: Good morning, you can see how the phases of one of the motors are cut inside the shaft, my intention was to solder thicker phase cables to it so that they would support the maximum of each controller, ///// the other motor is untouched, with the standard phase cables that are 4 mm, you really shouldn't program more than 200A phase, conclusion:/ you have to replace the phase cables and change the hall cables, because if you have 300/400 A of phase per controller and you have to stay at 180/200A for safety, it's a real shame g remember that they are high speed motors,,,, so you need a lot of A of phase to have decent torque
[2025-04-17T07:47:07] skrtt: I dont think the shaft has enough space for 10m*2 cables
[2025-04-17T07:49:48] Yamal: in awg put the maximum thickness,,

She does 480lbs hip thrust workout... her stomach, granted she's had a kid is as tight and hard as possible. She caught this 240lbs dude in the air when he jumped at her wrestling and spun him in the air and suplexed him. Our buddy came out of his home from taking a piss and was all wtf happened?

[2025-04-18T07:31:36] KierreKikkeli: Ye nice, 1 watt headroom 😂😂
[2025-04-18T07:31:44] Noname: Best is you use dc/dc from battery and use light to trigger relay
[2025-04-18T07:33:53] KierreKikkeli: Would be somewhat difficult with my setup, all i wanna know is that if the adc's horn output can handle a stable load, the basic front light one sure does and has for past 3 months +
[2025-04-18T07:34:50] KierreKikkeli: Just need the long/ beams to be usable aswell, if nothing else i can steal the power for it directly from the ubox 12v
[2025-04-18T07:35:59] KierreKikkeli: Easiest way would be to just wire the light button handles beam button to the adc's horn input but need to know if the adc can handle it
[2025-04-18T07:36:08] Noname: I don't see why it wouldn't

[2025-04-18T07:37:02] KierreKikkeli: And old battery
[2025-04-18T07:37:08] KierreKikkeli: 12s 20a
[2025-04-18T07:40:02] KierreKikkeli: If the adc's horn input cant handle it, ill have to go and try to find a 3 way switch somewhere for cheap and steal the long beams power from the ubox
[2025-04-18T07:40:37] KierreKikkeli: And likely just patent it on the hande somehow
[2025-04-18T08:32:17] Yamal: Who Winn the race

[2025-04-18T10:36:26] Jason: i wish my laptop could connect to it

[2025-04-18T10:36:39] Smart Repair: via Bluetooth? I use Wi-Fi
[2025-04-18T10:37:14] Jason: idk why but even if i connect to wifi it just
[2025-04-18T10:37:19] Jason: doesnt display tcp hub
[2025-04-18T10:37:23] Jason: but on my phone it does
[2025-04-18T10:37:33] Smart Repair: you can configure Express as a station and then access your ESC over the network
[2025-04-18T10:37:39] Jason: ah wait
[2025-04-18T10:37:40] Jason: yes

[2025-04-18T10:39:20] Jason: mmmh
[2025-04-18T10:41:48] Jason: much better
[2025-04-18T10:42:01] Jason: idk why pc vesctool cant scan the tcp hub properly
[2025-04-18T10:42:10] Jason: maybe its just beta version tool
[2025-04-18T10:42:52] Smart Repair: If your Express is connected to the Wi-Fi it should be displayed without a scan
[2025-04-18T10:43:08] Jason: yeah it does on my phone
[2025-04-18T10:43:12] Jason: but not on my laptop

[2025-04-19T00:55:42] KierreKikkeli: Okay i did the connections as shown in the picture, and as its intended to be done on mopeds, but can someone tell me why when i flip the switch, both sides give me "beam lights" while it does indeed turn off in the middle, ie the switch is switching. edit: it seems like using this connection doesnt turn off the switches from the adc v2 when flipping the switch, instead it keeps both constantly on, and only cuts off the circuit when the on off switch is forcefully held on the middle, and turns both back on when the switch falls to either side??
[2025-04-19T00:56:46] KierreKikkeli: But if i do the switch manually from the bulb it works normally??
[2025-04-19T01:01:06] KierreKikkeli: ah... wait.... i guess im supposed to wire the headlight 12v and ground to the switch, and the switch onto the headlight? (pic in finnish, just says headlight and on off for beams)

[2025-04-19T20:54:36] Gordan Gizdic: <photos/photo_22760@19-04-2025_20-54-36.jpg>
[2025-04-19T20:55:10] Gordan Gizdic: Proper test of a Shitsky 75350 controller on a Surron.
[2025-04-19T20:56:13] Gordan Gizdic: Held nicely, temps low, no issues. Pack is 20S/13P made with copper, LG M58T cells.
[2025-04-19T20:56:51] Gordan Gizdic: 500 phase/235A batt amps. Efficiency almost 57wh/km. Top speed 127kmh.
[2025-04-19T20:57:03] Gordan Gizdic: Not bad for a cheap chinese controller
[2025-04-19T21:00:18] Gordan Gizdic: Sotion FW01 motor on 17" tyres and 38T sprocket. 100A of FW.
[2025-04-19T21:02:38] Happy Giraffe: How is the voltage sag if you pull this much from the 58T?
[2025-04-19T21:04:58] Gordan Gizdic: Not that bad. Around 6-7V.
[2025-04-19T21:05:14] Gordan Gizdic: More like 7V
[2025-04-19T21:06:05] Gordan Gizdic: James actually measured this pack when he built it. We were surprised how little voktage sag there was for this level of power. It also survived a few pulls at roughly 32kw peak.
[2025-04-19T21:06:54] Gordan Gizdic: At 235A comes down to around 18-19A per cell.
[2025-04-19T21:07:44] Gordan Gizdic: Big packs can handle power pretty much better than smaller packs. Mind you, this pack is 260 cells on copper
[2025-04-19T21:07:50] Gordan Gizdic: And its hugeeee.
[2025-04-19T21:08:15] Happy Giraffe: Aah you had the metal casing on there?🤔
[2025-04-19T21:08:21] Gordan Gizdic: Yup
[2025-04-19T21:08:33] Happy Giraffe: Haha, I made the box😁
[2025-04-19T21:08:38] Gordan Gizdic: Aaaah
[2025-04-19T21:08:41] Gordan Gizdic: That was you.
[2025-04-19T21:08:52] Gordan Gizdic: Mate, never got the chance to thank you for it.
[2025-04-19T21:08:58] Gordan Gizdic: Top notch wprkmanship
[2025-04-19T21:09:03] Gordan Gizdic: Thnx 100x
[2025-04-19T21:09:10] Happy Giraffe: If its still in one piece Im satisfied😂
[2025-04-19T21:09:39] Gordan Gizdic: Yeah mate. Sold it to a kid living close by. Kid is driving that surron like he stole it.
[2025-04-19T21:09:46] Gordan Gizdic: And so far not a single issue.
[2025-04-19T21:09:55] Happy Giraffe: Thats cool to hear
[2025-04-19T21:09:59] Gordan Gizdic: I, on the other hand went a bit different route.
[2025-04-19T21:10:33] Happy Giraffe: Range at cruise speed range must have been insane as it was such a massive pack
[2025-04-19T21:10:37] Gordan Gizdic: <photos/photo_22761@19-04-2025_21-10-37.jpg>
[2025-04-19T21:11:11] Gordan Gizdic: I got muktiple times over 100km at 70ish volts
[2025-04-19T21:11:24] Gordan Gizdic: So yeag, still had quite some distance in it
[2025-04-19T21:11:42] Gordan Gizdic: But my butt could NOT handle that distance so i gave up.
[2025-04-19T21:11:53] haku: james made your pack?
[2025-04-19T21:12:11] haku: can i see how much it sticks out if you dont mind?
[2025-04-19T21:12:35] Gordan Gizdic: Ugh. Gimme a few mins to dig the images from like ice ages.
[2025-04-19T21:12:36] Happy Giraffe: Haha, yes this I this is the deal. Sadly we dont have this insane charge speeds the cars do to keep pack sizes small
[2025-04-19T21:13:05] Gordan Gizdic: Charhe was not the problem. I pushed 1.5kw of charhing into it
[2025-04-19T21:13:29] Gordan Gizdic: So like 2-3hr charge time from like 40% SoC
[2025-04-19T21:14:31] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I meant like cellphones or newest cars that go 20-80% in 15 mins or so
[2025-04-19T21:15:10] Happy Giraffe: But if charging with 1.5kw and eating lunch its plenty anyways
[2025-04-19T21:16:06] Gordan Gizdic: Yeah, i tedted once like that. Went to a clients resprt thats like 80ish km away. Had lunch, came back, bike was 90+ SoC.
[2025-04-19T21:16:10] Gordan Gizdic: So not a problem.
[2025-04-19T21:16:16] Gordan Gizdic: Did 160km that day.
[2025-04-19T21:16:41] Gordan Gizdic: Cant find a single image on this phone but yes, pack is huge and it sticks out a LOT!
[2025-04-19T21:16:47] Gordan Gizdic: Like 15cm almost
[2025-04-19T21:17:49] Gordan Gizdic: Yeah. james made it. Top notch work on it.
[2025-04-19T21:21:02] Happy Giraffe: I also got a 20s5p 50G pack from him. So well made. Perfectly balanced cells, like all things should be😉
[2025-04-19T21:21:34] Gordan Gizdic: Well, its James.
[2025-04-19T21:21:44] Gordan Gizdic: Doode is proper good guy. Cant fault him.
[2025-04-19T21:24:18] Smart Repair: Can someone help me... RX TX is cross-connected to x12. No data is coming through to the display. Anyone have any ideas? it is the simple vesc display on an esp32
[2025-04-19T21:26:58] Happy Giraffe: I did one esp32 display a year ago but dont remember much. Other than it wasnt plug and play. Maybe @jamessoderstrom has a better memory than I do
[2025-04-19T21:30:39] Smart Repair: I hate software 😖 maybe I should mount an old speedometer with a shaft 😂
[2025-04-19T21:31:14] Happy Giraffe: And remember to keep the usb port readily available for speedometer tuning against your gps😁 I siliconed it shut and wasnt fun opening it

[2025-04-20T07:19:31] Yamal: Rest in peace, good man. My deepest condolences to his family as well. These unfortunate events also teach us, or give us a life lesson: we can never let our guard down with our e-scooters, and we should always be very respectful of them, because accidents can always happen.

[2025-04-20T19:08:44] Yamal: Hi @francois_schempers It would be nice if you could use your quantum computer to fully define VESC. ::: What is VESC? VESC PROJECT And what are its benefits and differences compared to other electronics?
[2025-04-20T19:09:43] Yamal: to be able to share concepts to further promote VESC ELECTRONIC
[2025-04-20T19:10:04] Hugo: hey there
[2025-04-20T19:10:26] Hugo: i just bought an ubox 240a and i cannot downgrade to v5.3
[2025-04-20T19:10:55] francois schempers: it already exist in the document I shared ;)
[2025-04-20T19:27:00] 'lekrsu': Yes, a daughter.
[2025-04-20T20:08:56] Pandalgns: Guys I have a problem with one of my VESC, the problem is that since I connect both at the same time I don't know which one it is. Since the other day I was testing one of them, it sparked and the motors shorted out, I removed the controllers and tried to plug in the battery alone and tried to connect it to the PC to see if it showed me any fault but it turns out that every time I connect them, as soon as I touch the xt60, it explodes and burns the connector, as if there was a short circuit in the positive and negative, I disassembled the controllers and I don't see anything burned or anything strange in the power tracks. Now my question is, if I try to connect the VESC to a power supply, will the source explode?

[2025-04-20T20:13:28] haku: what does your ai say about me? good or bad?
[2025-04-20T20:26:01] Pandalgns: With the multimeter on the positive and the negative on the phase?
[2025-04-20T20:29:06] Pandalgns: Phase c and a 49.5k ohm fase b 0 ohm
[2025-04-20T20:32:40] Pandalgns: And in the other controller 198mohm per phase
[2025-04-20T20:32:43] Pandalgns: 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
[2025-04-20T20:32:51] Pandalgns: All mosfets burned?

[2025-04-20T20:42:30] Pandalgns: This is the other one, the one with a short phase
[2025-04-20T20:43:33] Pandalgns: 0 ohm is bad, but 49k ohm is okay?
[2025-04-20T20:45:26] Pandalgns: Ok just a dead phase, I'll try to fix it and see what I do.
[2025-04-20T20:48:28] Pandalgns: Mks 84100hp
[2025-04-20T20:48:34] Pandalgns: It's cheap
[2025-04-20T20:48:53] Pandalgns: Around 90 euros, but if two mosfets cost me 5 euros... I'll try it.
[2025-04-20T20:49:43] 'lekrsu': Don't get mosfets from Ali
[2025-04-20T20:49:56] Pandalgns: I see, unsoldering the 5 towers shouldn't be easy.
[2025-04-20T20:50:24] Pandalgns: Where can I buy quality mosfets?
[2025-04-20T20:50:35] 'lekrsu': LCSC
[2025-04-20T20:50:49] 'lekrsu': But it'll be mosfet + 15€+ shipping
[2025-04-20T20:51:06] 'lekrsu': Ali has clones too often.
[2025-04-20T20:51:18] Pandalgns: 15 euros per mosfet??
[2025-04-20T20:51:27] 'lekrsu': No
[2025-04-20T20:51:45] 'lekrsu': Which mos do they install on 84100hp?

[2025-04-21T20:27:12] haku: may is due date on those. after wepoor
[2025-04-21T20:27:35] haku: no need to buy em
[2025-04-21T20:27:44] haku: you get an extra .4
[2025-04-21T20:31:50] haku: should i post my build in the fb vesc group and say i spent 36k on this worlds fastest mini bmx?
[2025-04-21T20:34:18] Noname: Yeah I need a .2
[2025-04-21T20:34:56] haku: ill send you mine. might be clogged but i suggest get the whole hot end assembly
[2025-04-21T20:35:07] haku: so you wont put thermal paste everytime
[2025-04-21T20:35:31] haku: .2 is not worth the time. im impatient
[2025-04-21T20:51:09] haku: Noname its still here but prices went up. its calling my name.
[2025-04-21T20:58:40] Noname: I'll just buy one. .2 for Vsett battery need that 11p. On another note I taught bosses son in law to weld. My instructions were stfu and push the trigger
[2025-04-21T21:00:35] haku: is it really that easy. thats one of my 2025 goals
[2025-04-21T21:11:34] haku: i will not weld my own disk brake adapters i need a pro or atleast an amateur thats ready to turn pro to do it
[2025-04-21T21:21:00] haku: gentlemen serious question here. how hard is it to program these. asking for a friend that i might consider a computer illiterate or maybe a non intelectual person. that person might or might not have graduated elementary and his skills are limited.
[2025-04-21T21:23:27] Noname: Your already good at pushing people's buttons shouldn't be to hard to learn
[2025-04-21T21:23:46] Noname: Button trigger close enough
[2025-04-21T21:25:34] Noname: Shit you already know how to melt metal with electricity. Should be super easy
[2025-04-21T21:33:05] haku: hahaha

[2025-04-22T16:29:17] Yamal: Shaman one back again
[2025-04-22T16:29:47] Noname: At least they use single larger wire now. Dual kinda sucked
[2025-04-22T16:31:11] Noname: About 18mm shorter L+w but 10mm taller
[2025-04-22T16:33:10] Noname: But whatever you have plugs sticking out the top so not horrible

[2025-04-22T16:37:36] Noname: I hate those, it was a twist throttle
[2025-04-22T16:59:41] Smart Repair: I think dual is better = 2x XT90. However, single phase cables are better 👍
[2025-04-22T17:00:38] Smart Repair: Now many will use 1x XT90, which is far too little. Only a few will use it on QS8 etc.
[2025-04-22T17:16:15] Noname: I'll give ya that on the power but at least give us some extra wire 😆

[2025-04-22T18:21:51] haku: 11 would be nice on this bike. but 10 is not bad
[2025-04-22T18:21:56] Noname: That's small enough could use hand electrical tubing bender.
[2025-04-22T18:22:28] Noname: I've snapped the foot off them though lol
[2025-04-22T18:22:49] haku: next peak g30v3 maybe. not on this
[2025-04-22T18:23:14] haku: this steel on this bike. pretty strong though
[2025-04-22T18:23:20] haku: welds too
[2025-04-22T18:26:42] Noname: You can weld a glass bottle to a fence post what's your point
[2025-04-22T18:27:33] haku: what im trying to say. its not tack welded like some other bikes
[2025-04-22T18:27:48] haku: like bomber frames
[2025-04-22T18:33:10] Matthew: I see sold out. Is that meaning production is over and now our choice for higher power will be the 85240?
[2025-04-22T18:33:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I needed a tire too bad apparently
[2025-04-22T18:33:21] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Because I got 3
[2025-04-22T18:41:24] Smart Repair: Yes, production is discontinued. The 240 has the same performance data. If you need more, I recommend the x12 or seven.

[2025-04-22T18:59:32] haku: dont hate. we are not all rich

[2025-04-22T19:02:32] haku: lets just count our blessings shall we
[2025-04-22T19:04:54] haku: do you really need pmt if all your doing is this?
[2025-04-22T19:09:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It looked like it
[2025-04-22T19:11:31] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <video_file>
[2025-04-22T19:18:40] haku: unless pmt will make more smoke. i will convert. it has to be scientific data
[2025-04-22T19:19:16] haku: pmt 10x3 will fit in my rim i think
[2025-04-22T19:23:34] Noname: Pmt doesn't squeel like a china tire. Kinda boring
[2025-04-22T19:24:15] haku: but will it have superior smoke? very white smoke
[2025-04-22T19:24:57] haku: i didnt mean that in a racial way. i mean will the smoke be very very white and dense?
[2025-04-22T19:37:37] Noname: I've never seen smoke from mine so 🤷
[2025-04-22T19:38:06] Noname: Need some baby gender reveal tires

[2025-04-22T19:44:35] haku: still need physical brakes just incase
[2025-04-22T19:44:59] Noname: Never had problem with regen. Only lost hydro when I stopped using them, full of dirt almost died
[2025-04-22T19:45:33] haku: i dont go fast on this anyways but still good to have real brakes
[2025-04-22T19:45:49] skrtt: Is there anyway i can make a hole on the shaft so that the phases dont touch the ground if i fall
[2025-04-22T19:46:26] haku: mt5 will fit if i shave some off the back. but i have other 4 piston brakes. also zoom brakes from laotie if worse comes to worse
[2025-04-22T19:47:11] haku: not sure dude. maybe

[2025-04-22T21:55:13] haku: turkey is back!
[2025-04-22T21:55:58] Noname: Can get amp meter for it. Or borrow a multimeter that has that function. It's called a clamp meter.
[2025-04-22T21:56:37] puneDir: I have clamp meter but it can only do ac
[2025-04-22T21:57:35] Noname: Ac amps? I don't think.it matters

[2025-04-22T22:23:29] 'lekrsu': Do you power it with VESC? Then you can.
[2025-04-22T22:24:15] puneDir: Sadly i dont
[2025-04-22T22:24:40] 'lekrsu': Make sure your clamp meter, if it actually can do DC, is not clamping around both negative and positive cable.

[2025-04-24T00:54:37] haku: i know. it takes a special mind to build something like this. you know what im saying?
[2025-04-24T00:58:10] Noname: I'm gonna build an 11" and hang it on my wall
[2025-04-24T00:58:19] haku: nooo

[2025-04-24T01:00:22] 'lekrsu': I praise the future value of the HakuIndustries stocks to increase so we can loan DogeCoin on our assets

[2025-04-24T01:08:34] haku: thats the point of haku industries. you may look like a bum but your a smart bum. you feel me dawgs
[2025-04-24T01:10:41] haku: or maybe you make look like a bum because you are a bum? is that better?
[2025-04-24T01:12:28] Noname: You got tossed out of a wedding?
[2025-04-24T01:12:44] haku: maybe or maybe not.
[2025-04-24T01:12:45] Noname: No just the frame.
[2025-04-24T01:14:40] Noname: Projects are more important than hygiene at Haku industries. They don't call it The sweet smell of success for nothing.
[2025-04-24T01:49:37] Matthew: What am I building? I have a g30lp with a new 65h 17x4 motor. I have 2 60v 31.5ah batteries. I can't decide to go 20s. Stay at 16s and have 63Ah. So other option 32s 90amps battery.. 16s and 20s i have 85150 and 85250.
[2025-04-24T02:33:07] Matthew: <photos/photo_22817@24-04-2025_02-33-07.jpg>
[2025-04-24T02:33:30] Matthew: Is the 20ah 40p a good option?
[2025-04-24T02:40:12] skrtt: How many ah at 32s
[2025-04-24T03:28:20] Matthew: 31.5ah
[2025-04-24T03:28:35] Matthew: 90 battery

[2025-04-24T03:34:11] Giuseppe Ferra: Hi, what connectors do you recommend I put for the engine?
[2025-04-24T03:52:15] haku: yes good. i would go p42 if you can spare someore. do you know if these baterries have smart bms
[2025-04-24T04:39:28] Matthew: <photos/photo_22818@24-04-2025_04-39-28.jpg>
[2025-04-24T04:40:48] Matthew: The company says that they can build custom packs
[2025-04-24T04:46:53] Matthew: That battery would be for the 65h 17x4 i have setup. I'm hoping I can revive the 85150 i have issues with... I have the 85250 to use if I can't get the 85150 to work.
[2025-04-24T04:58:05] haku: very good specs
[2025-04-24T04:58:40] haku: 20s 5p pack.
[2025-04-24T06:24:02] Noname: Mmm 150$
[2025-04-24T06:24:51] Noname: Giant triangle battery?
[2025-04-24T06:27:18] Jason: with giant ass motor?
[2025-04-24T06:27:24] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-04-24T06:27:49] Noname: Well yeah 5kw prob lol

[2025-04-24T06:36:15] Jason: same
[2025-04-24T06:39:25] Franchesco Carofano: I'm going to leave this a new time, it was only connected to the power and it burst, there is no safe time, so I see that I bought 5 85vol 250 ah and of the 2, two were still solid. The rest with defects, two exploded the first time they were connected and one lasted a week, two moffe were added, configured at 200ah, 400 asolute and 170 battery.

[2025-04-24T06:40:46] Franchesco Carofano: The tester is not responsible, he invents and says that it was a voltage increase and it is a maximum 84 volt battery and he installed it with 79 volts of charge and burst.
[2025-04-24T06:42:30] Jason: cuh
[2025-04-24T06:42:50] Franchesco Carofano: <photos/photo_22825@24-04-2025_06-42-50.jpg>

[2025-04-24T06:44:21] Jason: you just go buy seven
[2025-04-24T06:44:24] Franchesco Carofano: I have some installed but those 3 were lost, two are from a client and one is the one that is blackest, I say that if it was running hard and it burned while walking, it didn't last more than 2 months and I burst the controls, they are very weak, I have 22x3 70h engines
[2025-04-24T06:44:27] Jason: the most expensive one and call it a day
[2025-04-24T06:44:51] Jason: caz youre pushing more than it can
[2025-04-24T06:45:26] Jason: or improper config
[2025-04-24T06:45:53] Franchesco Carofano: I was to blame for the black one but the other two connected them to the power and they burst.
[2025-04-24T06:46:19] Jason: mmm mosfet blowing up
[2025-04-24T06:47:02] Jason: also you plugging in 84v max voltage batt onto 85v esc
[2025-04-24T06:47:08] Jason: wishing it to blow up atp
[2025-04-24T06:47:14] Franchesco Carofano: original ortega 200curren 400. osolute 170 battery that could be there mall as i tell you it only connected h burst they came bad from the factory
[2025-04-24T06:50:03] Franchesco Carofano: If the ones I have fail, I will use more vesc and I will buy a controller that is more proven and worth it.
[2025-04-24T06:50:44] Jason: btw seven is vesc
[2025-04-24T06:50:49] Jason: seven or 3shul

[2025-04-25T22:29:27] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes
[2025-04-25T22:37:37] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I'm helping him assemble it, well it's already assembled🤣 I just need to adjust the brakes, they were very crazy, the scooter was braking
[2025-04-25T22:48:36] Yamal: I spent days trying to put the axles in and the bearings wouldn't fit, in the meantime I hit my finger, and I thought about abandoning the Nami and saving it, I even considered moving the components to the Ninebot G2, I said o o I thought Nami is over! That's when Ayo enters the scene to give a renewed and intense light to the renewed Nami, he never loses hope, it has been a triumphant entrance just like when Gandalf arrives with his carriage to the Shire and Frodo receives him, very happy to be so close to the detection of engines
[2025-04-25T23:03:26] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Let's hope it's Sunday. I'll try to finish tomorrow morning.

[2025-04-26T03:44:57] haku: hot dam. depends if you want a midrive or hub. i would like a midrive
[2025-04-26T03:45:46] Noname: Dual 33x2 or whatever and 20s12p p42
[2025-04-26T03:46:45] haku: prolly can fit that battery. the dropout need to be modified though for scooter hubs
[2025-04-26T03:47:24] haku: what frame is that
[2025-04-26T03:47:27] Noname: If you just made your own
[2025-04-26T03:47:59] Noname: 1500$ minibike
[2025-04-26T03:48:30] haku: weld and bend tube frames yourself for that price
[2025-04-26T03:48:40] haku: you have the tools
[2025-04-26T03:49:08] haku: midrive mini bike would be cool though
[2025-04-26T03:49:11] Noname: Yes I can make it
[2025-04-26T03:49:29] Noname: Just giggle because that with 30kw would be insane
[2025-04-26T03:49:38] haku: agreed.
[2025-04-26T03:54:14] haku: 33x2 is cool but imo 16x4 is fun af.
[2025-04-26T05:46:48] haku: 33x2 needs too much amps. at 13" tires hard to do dual motor burnouts wich is my new favorite thing to do now.
[2025-04-26T05:48:04] haku: i will set the trend for super small light ebikes.
[2025-04-26T05:48:07] Noname: "Or whatever" meant motor of choice
[2025-04-26T05:56:06] haku: the thing is vesc that can take those amps are expensive
[2025-04-26T05:56:06] haku: peak g30v2 blitzkrieg edition. or in america its called the velociraptor. is a cheap build. ill make that a trend. watch

Is there someone I can DM for extended help with my vsett10+, it's my first time trying this ubox vesc stuff and i'm really excited but very confused on the procedure at hand? I think I have figured out most of the wiring but I think it would be good to make sure with someone who's done it before. And I might have questions for the software side and performance and such. (sorry if you saw this message in the other channel, i made a mistake posting it there)
[2025-04-26T19:55:51] Rose: Hey there Samsam, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-04-26T20:00:08] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/DHrTh8-Iksg?si=mvduze3Jlh6aMp-l
[2025-04-26T20:00:13] Yamal: 😭
[2025-04-26T20:02:51] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: We must do our part to help Yamal.
[2025-04-26T20:03:30] Samsam: good morning/good evening I apologize for my bad English but I write from Italy and I use the translator anyway I'm building a scooter from a kaboo wolf worior base for the battery and a 60v 21ah 16s8p and I'm looking for a vesc dual I'm undecided between flipsky or spinted what do you recommend I'm a beginner I was watching a video on youtube how to program it it doesn't seem that difficult to make the connections with hall sensors engine phases and register the battery only that I'm afraid of blowing the control board can anyone give me some tips before I set my house on fire? 🤣
[2025-04-26T20:04:03] Noname: Just ask question here. Also search function helps.
[2025-04-26T20:05:03] Samsam: I'll start by saying that I still have to order everything and the scooter's electronics are giving up on me. If I turn on the lights it gives me error 10 so I would clean all the cables and make a separate lighting system with a 12v battery.
[2025-04-26T20:06:13] Noname: Spintent is the better brand. Use a 90v to 12v dc/dc off the battery for lights
[2025-04-26T20:07:00] William Tremblay: Okay perfect, can I post images?
[2025-04-26T20:10:52] Samsam: nice idea I have a battery with double output because the scooter is born with two control units I could use the second one or I have some cells at home 18650 I would take a 12v bms and I would make an external battery so I don't go consuming current from the scooter battery so I have a few more meters to travel only that I live in the mountains and there are a lot of steep climbs and a problem for the bladders? for the overheating fact because I would use the scooter even when it rains unfortunately and my only means of transport put the bladders on the outside I don't want them to end up flambé🥲
[2025-04-26T20:31:12] haku: its a secret. thats a fed question yamal. sometimes i question if your a plant to lure us in. but i doubt it
[2025-04-26T20:33:30] haku: i trust you with all my secrets yamal

[2025-04-27T20:24:01] William Tremblay: okay thank you so much and sorry for the delay, first I wanted to know am I supposed to program the alu lites with the Vesc software before or after plugging everything into the scooter?
[2025-04-27T20:43:18] Smart Repair: First, install everything. Maybe update the firmware first if you no longer have access via USB.
[2025-04-27T21:07:39] Face de Pin Sucé: Ouep
[2025-04-27T21:12:40] William Tremblay: if I plug both alu lites into my ADC adapter v3, I assume i don't link them master slave through the can cable correct? and is it better to have them linked by can or I should plug em both into the ADC adapter

[2025-04-28T00:14:40] haku: 80h 33x2 machine! whats the name of this badboy @jamaludin_algarnati. my suggestions are "the matador" or "mademoisells brigettes cock!" the french name
[2025-04-28T00:17:09] Yamal: Crazyyyyyyy

[2025-04-28T03:37:20] Crazy scoots: <video_file>
[2025-04-28T05:26:22] Yamal: 80h 33/2 now 60h 22/3 before. Well, since these are large, high-speed motors, our expectations were that the output or torque would be slightly reduced, since my voltage is only 20s and my phase discharge wasn't going to be stratospheric either. But... The first impressions have been amazing with only 100A battery and 200A phase.
[2025-04-28T05:27:31] Yamal: I will be passing on data on absolutely everything
[2025-04-28T05:30:02] Yamal: And surron accelerator I really like !!!!

[2025-04-28T05:38:43] haku: make 12fet sing boy
[2025-04-28T05:50:21] Yamal: I have a nominal 350A battery, and I'm not going to go above the nominal, I have no need to stress my battery... and I'm not going to go beyond 300 phase since we know that in Ubox they are safe, to go to 350 according to the experts, you are no longer safe" although of course things can always happen
[2025-04-28T05:54:53] Yamal: VESC ESC 6 fets = 150A Safe 6 fets = 200A work not safe 12 fets = 300A safe 12 fets = 400A work but not safe
[2025-04-28T05:55:37] Yamal: Raphael many months ago

[2025-04-28T05:57:58] haku: 10p can peak at 450
[2025-04-28T06:00:11] haku: make it sing the la marseillaise!
[2025-04-28T06:01:01] Yamal: I don't like peaks
[2025-04-28T06:01:03] Yamal: XD
[2025-04-28T06:02:22] Yamal: We agree that they are peaks of perhaps a few seconds, but I repeat: I have no need to go above my nominal voltage.
[2025-04-28T06:03:03] haku: im talking amps my boy
[2025-04-28T06:03:22] Yamal: I’m talking about battery amps

[2025-04-28T06:05:56] haku: make him proud
[2025-04-28T06:07:43] Yamal: Of course, but why accelerate the degradation of my battery/stress/temp,,? 350A total is really good
[2025-04-28T06:08:50] Yamal: That is to say, why not work with the battery safety, what need do we have to squeeze it?
[2025-04-28T06:10:03] Yamal: I see it and think like this... it's better to work with comfortable and safe values, whatever the peaks may be.
[2025-04-28T06:14:54] haku: i respect that discission. but when the itch comes you need to scratch it.
[2025-04-28T06:16:14] Noname: When that itch gets scratched by pavement

[2025-04-28T10:07:02] Jason: id recommend 3shul for it tbh
[2025-04-28T10:11:11] Smart Repair: There's no general answer to that. If you don't need a separate ramp-in time, etc., then connect via CAN. Incidentally, you can connect both with ADC and still have a CAN connection between the two ESCs. You just have to deactivate the data transmission.

[2025-04-28T13:01:01] Martin Kaktits: im having little problem again :( I runmotor detection and it works fine. Spins up during detection. Detects foc parameters and even halls just fine. But when i go in to app remote to press "set FWD" or "set REV" it just does a little click and nothing happens. Not even in sensoreless mode, not even if i give it a spin up by hand. No faults printed in terminal. This is something completely new for me
[2025-04-28T13:01:50] 'lekrsu': Did you skip reset, and thus ADC is active?
[2025-04-28T13:03:34] Martin Kaktits: im sorry i dont even understand the question 🙈 but i did reinstall firmware because idk, i couldnt make ay sense of it so might as well try
[2025-04-28T13:04:21] Martin Kaktits: ADC is not connected. Neither is dash or anything. Just halls, CAN, power, phase and bluetooth
[2025-04-28T13:04:24] 'lekrsu': Adc1/2, as in throttle brake, if enabled, they disable the manual control of motor spin via VescTool.
[2025-04-28T13:04:57] 'lekrsu': If you don't turn them off, or skip 'reset' when prompted before detection, then fwd/rev won't spin either.
[2025-04-28T13:05:30] Martin Kaktits: hmm let me check
[2025-04-28T13:08:08] Martin Kaktits: <photos/photo_22862@28-04-2025_13-08-08.jpg>

[2025-04-28T13:11:36] Martin Kaktits: When i press this to check motor direction it goes brrrrt kltkltt. As if bad phase or something.
[2025-04-28T13:11:39] Hackintoshhhh: Control type needs to be uart i think

[2025-04-28T13:38:08] Jason: mm wait for mine
[2025-04-28T13:38:39] Jason: if you use adc to control motor you gotta set app to adc
[2025-04-28T13:38:53] Jason: also to enable uart you gotta use adc and uart

[2025-04-28T20:54:58] Face de Pin Sucé: It is RM-X
[2025-04-28T20:55:06] Face de Pin Sucé: Hahaha not at all
[2025-04-28T21:01:42] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: With the same controllers that I have? Mmmmm the phase amps 😱 I can only put 400
[2025-04-28T21:59:20] haku: what? fardriver on vesc software?
[2025-04-28T21:59:39] haku: this was my idea
[2025-04-28T22:00:06] haku: props for for doing it @SibClimb
[2025-04-28T22:42:51] Pandalgns: Guys, I have a serious doubt that I don't know if it's witchcraft, an evil eye, or what, but I don't understand anything, the phase cables of the vesc are well soldered to the plate, they don't move or anything strange, but if I leave them loose or oriented to any side and the engine fails, it vibrates and barely accelerates, however if I hold them to the right well attached to the vesc everything works fine... wtf??
[2025-04-28T22:43:15] Pandalgns: Can someone help me figure out why?
[2025-04-28T22:43:25] Pandalgns: <video_file>
[2025-04-28T22:49:20] Olexander: Maybe short circuit to alu frame of esc or alu plate
[2025-04-28T22:50:27] Pandalgns: I'll have to try without the case.
[2025-04-28T23:02:35] Noname: God damn this thing is a monster

[2025-04-28T23:26:13] Noname: Need to buy end mill and open swingarm
[2025-04-28T23:46:24] Face de Pin Sucé: No, fardriver inside Velity scooters
[2025-04-29T00:03:25] haku: ok gotcha
[2025-04-29T00:04:49] haku: tell boss let him buy it haha
[2025-04-29T00:05:29] Noname: Yeah ok lol. Gonna lazer cut some torque washers on his machine though lol
[2025-04-29T01:37:33] skrtt: 100°C is too much for a stock dt controller?
[2025-04-29T01:38:41] Jason: maybe its hall cable?
[2025-04-29T01:43:36] Pandalgns: No, the problem comes with the position of the phase cables, when I move them to the right if you notice it works well, in any other position the cables are as if they were shorting between phases or something strange.
[2025-04-29T01:46:28] Pandalgns: I even tried putting two to the right and one to the left with the three cables alternating the cable that I put to the left and it makes the same error, it is when any of the three cables is not stuck to the right when it makes the error
[2025-04-29T02:20:11] skrtt: Really?
[2025-04-29T02:20:20] skrtt: 😭😭
[2025-04-29T02:21:48] skrtt: I basically went 30km full throttle between 70/85

[2025-04-29T21:01:00] Pandalgns: <video_file>
[2025-04-29T21:01:19] Pandalgns: I don't see any phase shorting or anything with the plate 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂ I don't know what's going on
[2025-04-29T21:02:50] Pandalgns: I only see that when I twist the cables to the exact position it works fine if I leave them in any other position it fails
[2025-04-29T21:02:51] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: have you tried to do the detection again
[2025-04-29T21:03:13] Pandalgns: I'm going to do it
[2025-04-29T21:03:44] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: then I think you have a bad contact
[2025-04-29T21:03:49] Pandalgns: But I don't understand why it fails or stops failing depending on how I put the phase cables in the controller.
[2025-04-29T21:04:21] Pandalgns: It can't be, the wires are perfectly soldered in place....
[2025-04-29T21:05:21] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I understand you but if we move the cable and it works
[2025-04-29T21:06:26] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: try to do the detection again
[2025-04-29T21:07:48] Pandalgns: It's weird, sometimes it doesn't even move, but in vesctool it seems to send the 200-300A phase to the motor.
[2025-04-29T21:08:10] Pandalgns: But suddenly it starts failing with a jerk and the phase cables get hot
[2025-04-29T21:08:24] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I think it's a bad contact, try to make a new arrest.
[2025-04-29T21:11:32] Pandalgns: The detection is done well, that is, I don't touch the cables and the motor moves well, but this motor used to have sensors working and now it marks it as sensorless, I see something different, it must have burned halls... to make it work without halls like the front one, that's for starters.
[2025-04-29T21:14:48] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: assist the engine with your hand
[2025-04-29T22:01:43] Pandalgns: It works fine now, the problem came from the rear halls, before I had no front halls because they are screwed up and the rear ones were working, it turns out that the rear ones must have been screwed up too and I just configured it without rear halls too and now it works fine although I would like to fine-tune the output so that it comes out at full speed from scratch but I don't know if I will be able to get the exact point.
[2025-04-29T22:06:52] Pandalgns: Al corte 😂😂😂
[2025-04-29T23:04:13] Rose: Hey there Genny, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2025-04-30T02:43:28] skrtt: I think 2,5k is a fair price with all that material
[2025-04-30T02:45:20] skrtt: Maybe a little more cuz of battery

[2025-04-30T05:12:18] Yamal: ⸻ Why Are Stand-Up E-Scooters More Popular? Is There a Gender Perception Behind Their Use? Stand-up e-scooters have become the most common option in many cities around the world. This trend is not random—it’s driven by several practical factors: 1. Portability and ease of use: They are lighter, foldable, and easier to carry, making them ideal for short trips or for combining with other means of transportation. 2. Favorable urban regulations: In many cities, stand-up models fit better within traffic regulations, as they are considered less invasive and safer in dense urban environments. 3. Shared mobility services: Companies like Lime, Bird, and Tier mostly use stand-up models because they are durable, low-maintenance, and easy for occasional users to operate. Is There a Gender Perception Around These Vehicles? Yes, in some cultural contexts there is still an idea that riding a stand-up e-scooter is more associated with women. This perception may stem from several factors: • Urban context of early adoption: In cities like New York, many of the first regular users of stand-up e-scooters were young professional women, who chose them for their practicality, convenience, and speed. That initial image may have reinforced the association with femininity. • Gender stereotypes: Long-standing ideas still link small, agile, or practical vehicles with femininity, while robust, powerful, or “serious” vehicles are seen as masculine. In this sense, some view riding a vehicle without a seat as “less masculine,” compared to a motorcycle or larger scooter. • Riding posture: Standing while riding may be interpreted—through a traditional lens—as a more casual or even childlike posture, in contrast with the image of “sitting in control,” which has been culturally associated with dominance and masculinity. Current Reality Despite these perceptions, stand-up e-scooter use has expanded across all demographics. Men and women of various ages, lifestyles, and professions choose them for practical reasons. Design, comfort, and efficiency far outweigh any lingering gender biases. Conclusion Associating stand-up e-scooters with femininity is a stereotype that doesn’t reflect today’s reality. Personal mobility is evolving and adapting to new forms of transportation that are more sustainable, accessible, and functional. Nowadays, choosing this type of vehicle is about meeting real needs—not about outdated social constructs. ⸻
[2025-04-30T05:13:23] Yamal: ⸻ It makes sense that you say that, and you’re not alone in that perception. Many people see a seated e-scooter as something “unnatural” because it breaks away from the original essence of the scooter: a light, agile vehicle meant to be ridden standing up—almost like an extension of your body in motion. Here’s why that feeling might arise: ⸻ 1. Design and origin The electric scooter was originally conceived as a stand-up device: compact, simple, and direct. Adding a seat makes it look more like a weird hybrid between a bike and a small motorcycle, losing that minimalistic and dynamic aesthetic. 2. Sense of control When you ride standing up, you can: • Shift your body to stay balanced • React more quickly to obstacles • Feel more “connected” to the motion Sitting, on the other hand, creates a more passive posture, which some interpret as less natural for this type of vehicle. 3. Aesthetics and perception Visually, seated scooters often look awkward or unbalanced, especially if the seat seems like an add-on. In contrast, standing scooters have a cleaner design that matches their purpose better. ⸻ That said, seated scooters do have their audience: older adults, people with mobility issues, or those who want more comfort over long distances. But from the perspective of fast, modern urban movement, it’s understandable why a seated scooter might seem to go against that logic.

[2025-04-30T07:00:12] Yamal: Another thing I'm loving is the Sur-ron accelerator (surron type), it's super intuitive, really cool. I'm paying a lot of attention, especially when the scooter is stopped, as I usually turn it off early, in case someone touches the handlebar and causes an accident.

[2025-04-30T10:49:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Hey I have one 85240 that I'm planning to fix by buying a new logic board how do I prevent such blowing up?
[2025-04-30T11:47:29] Hackintoshhhh: I want to buy the broken ones off of you
[2025-04-30T11:49:05] Hackintoshhhh: You don’t
[2025-04-30T11:49:10] Hackintoshhhh: Thats the scary part
[2025-04-30T11:51:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Well I already tried using it it worked fine I killed logic because of a short (+-) so it's not faulty unit or something it's user error
[2025-04-30T11:51:41] Hackintoshhhh: I also want that one
[2025-04-30T11:52:07] Hackintoshhhh: I am buuying all broken spintend
[2025-04-30T11:52:12] Hackintoshhhh: Js dm me ppl
[2025-04-30T11:52:40] Hackintoshhhh: Yeah idk some spintend are DOA but if they arrive working they dont break except user error
[2025-04-30T11:52:58] Hackintoshhhh: Would you send me that logic
[2025-04-30T11:53:05] Hackintoshhhh: Of 85250? Or 240?
[2025-04-30T11:54:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 240 maybe it's less doa
[2025-04-30T11:55:16] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Broken logic board? Too much of a hustle to send 😕
[2025-04-30T12:02:29] Hackintoshhhh: Out of curiosity, can you still send and receive post from outside in israel?
[2025-04-30T12:03:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Wdym ? U think we are north Korea ?
[2025-04-30T12:03:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ask @jamessoderstrom 😉
[2025-04-30T12:05:02] Hackintoshhhh: Country is at war, getting my konyk clamp out of ukraine required me to sign different forms and and the sender too, also took him a month to find a sketchy company willing to ship it at all
[2025-04-30T12:15:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The difference between us to Ukraine is we are winning 😉 and only suth side us at war
[2025-04-30T12:16:02] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also Russian or Ukraine shipping even without war Is complicated
[2025-04-30T12:16:23] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Wich is unfortunate because they have a lot of good parts for my thunder
[2025-04-30T12:16:40] Hackintoshhhh: Russia-Switzerland is uncomplicated
[2025-04-30T12:16:46] Hackintoshhhh: But ukraine…
[2025-04-30T12:17:06] Hackintoshhhh: Ukraine-Poland-Switzerland, triangle shipping needed
[2025-04-30T12:17:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Here only problem is the yemanis
[2025-04-30T12:17:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ahaa so at least 2 shipping companies
[2025-04-30T12:17:47] Hackintoshhhh: Yeah
[2025-04-30T12:18:21] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: With spintend if I didn't have James I'd also have to do that since they don't ship to me
[2025-04-30T12:18:24] Hackintoshhhh: Nova Poshta to Poland and then fedex
[2025-04-30T12:18:34] Hackintoshhhh: Oh interesting
[2025-04-30T12:18:47] Hackintoshhhh: Whatever shipping spintend uses it sucks
[2025-04-30T12:18:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: They have local provider who charges more then 2x

[2025-04-30T17:12:43] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, that usually happens to first-generation chaises.
[2025-04-30T17:13:01] Noname: Lol broke right after the welded plate who would have guessed

[2025-04-30T17:15:19] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: No, that chassis is old and does not have reinforcements.
[2025-04-30T17:16:42] skrtt: He says its a 72/40 new gen
[2025-04-30T17:17:46] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I am the owner of the Nami Spain group. I assure you that this chassis is the first generation. I have asked my group for a photo of the new chassis.
[2025-04-30T17:18:07] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: there are many versions
[2025-04-30T17:20:42] skrtt: I dont doubt u. Im just saying what the owner is saying
[2025-04-30T17:23:16] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, I know, but the duel is confused. I'll put the photo of the new chassis later so you can see it.
[2025-04-30T17:24:53] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: There are several versions of the 72/40 model, some with NFC, others without, some with turn signals, others without, it's a bit confusing.
[2025-04-30T17:27:43] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: the new chassis look at this reinforcement
[2025-04-30T17:28:53] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If they send me another photo of the other reinforcements later, I'll post it.

[2025-05-01T02:35:07] Matthew: Swd is connected. I have no idea how else it would connect. The other vesc turns on when I plug swd. So what firmware am I supposed to use? Spintend directions says they merged the 2

[2025-05-01T14:44:49] Yamal: No! But I really need a steering damper and some suspension adjustments to combat the beast's wobbling xD
[2025-05-01T14:52:24] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If you tighten the front spring to prevent it from moving so much, that happens because when you brake the scooter the geometry changes.
[2025-05-01T15:02:25] Noname: That is some jank looking wiring
[2025-05-01T15:02:38] Jason: yes very teporary
[2025-05-01T15:02:50] Jason: now the socket i intended arrived
[2025-05-01T15:02:57] Jason: so after designing enclosure and done
[2025-05-01T15:03:24] Noname: I also need to make one
[2025-05-01T15:03:39] Noname: 6.3kw charging
[2025-05-01T15:04:50] Noname: You are murdering those cells 😆
[2025-05-01T15:05:37] Jason: fuuuck finally
[2025-05-01T15:10:49] Jason: this looks stupid
[2025-05-01T15:12:14] Yamal: 😂🤙
[2025-05-01T15:15:38] Yamal: <video_file>
[2025-05-01T15:16:20] Jason: <photos/photo_22928@01-05-2025_15-16-20.jpg>
[2025-05-01T15:16:22] Jason: bit better
[2025-05-01T15:16:26] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-05-01T15:20:49] 'lekrsu': Efficiency is less by the 75A field weakening. Try riding with 0 for a while.
[2025-05-01T15:26:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Sorry I want top speed more then 90kmh
[2025-05-01T15:31:12] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <video_file>
[2025-05-01T15:34:25] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: If 0 them how much phase amps??????
[2025-05-01T15:39:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Now trying 0 fwk
[2025-05-01T15:39:25] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 250 phase amps rear 180 front
[2025-05-01T15:41:10] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Got over current but was good acceleration somehow
[2025-05-01T15:46:18] 'lekrsu': If you reduce phase (mostly low speed torque) and battery current (limits phase at high speed, so high speed torque), then you practically, draw less in total.
[2025-05-01T15:57:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The fact that to lowerd the fwk to 0 is good already no ?
[2025-05-01T15:57:36] 'lekrsu': Yes, it'll draw significantly less power.
[2025-05-01T15:57:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Before I had 180 rear 160 front (phase) now it's 250 rear 180 front
[2025-05-01T15:58:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And somehow the acceleration is way scarier
[2025-05-01T15:58:40] 'lekrsu': Yeah that's quite the difference
[2025-05-01T15:58:49] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I did 94 kmh without noticing tbh
[2025-05-01T16:01:05] Franchesco Carofano: We are far away, I am in Chile, friend.
[2025-05-01T16:01:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But does it supposed to heat up vesc more ???(After a 30 minutes ride with the fwk settings I was on 46c after changing what I said to be only phase u rode like 15min I was on 55c )
[2025-05-01T16:01:43] 'lekrsu': Field weakening is merely used at high speeds.
[2025-05-01T16:02:13] 'lekrsu': If you're stopping and accelerating, but now accelerating faster, then you do use more energy, and more heat.
[2025-05-01T16:03:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Motor is now at 48 after all of that
[2025-05-01T16:04:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And disk at 45 (after 5m since I stopped riding)
[2025-05-01T16:04:52] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Wether today
[2025-05-01T16:08:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also I think I'll go back to 90 tyres with all dou respect to the cornering abilities of the 100 tyres they are a huge hit to the performance
[2025-05-01T18:21:15] Samsam: Hi everyone, I'm about to buy some bladders, where do you recommend I get them? AliExpress or Flipsky or Spinted site?
[2025-05-01T18:22:29] Samsam: especially then to program the vesc could I ask one of you? I'm good at soldering and connecting but unfortunately I'm a fool at programming lol
[2025-05-01T18:28:52] Samsam: above all what model do you recommend my scooter is a scooter that has 1100w peak motors each so that together they arrive at 5600w ,60volt battery and the capacity is 21ah
[2025-05-01T18:29:26] Samsam: It’s a kaboo wolf warrior x
[2025-05-01T18:29:49] haku: bladders thats some black market stuff son
[2025-05-01T18:31:28] Samsam: I use google translate sorry 🥲
[2025-05-01T18:31:39] Samsam: Vesc 🤣
[2025-05-01T18:32:22] haku: if your in eu @jamessoderstrom sell spintend.
[2025-05-01T18:33:43] Samsam: Yes I’m in Italia
[2025-05-01T18:35:23] haku: italy shoes too narrow. tell shoe makers not good
[2025-05-01T18:35:37] Samsam: Tanks you very much
[2025-05-01T18:36:20] Smart Repair: -200A reg?
[2025-05-01T18:42:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: There is no brake sensor so no problem
[2025-05-01T18:42:58] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I just did looked on that settings since I'm only physical brake
[2025-05-01T19:51:43] Noname: New chunky torque arms 14mm axle vs stock 12mm axle. Fresh off the laser table
[2025-05-01T19:54:47] haku: lazer can cut that thick
[2025-05-01T19:55:10] haku: make me a bayonet mount
[2025-05-01T20:01:41] haku: dual scoots!
[2025-05-01T20:06:22] Noname: It's kinda maxing it out without oxygen set up. It's 3/8
[2025-05-01T20:06:42] Noname: Is this "bayonet" a penis?
[2025-05-01T20:07:42] haku: maybe or maybe not
[2025-05-01T20:09:33] haku: my battery box and vesc box looks like a kids shoebox. teach me how to chamfer edges in cad you advanced boy
[2025-05-01T20:30:39] Noname: Click chamfer icon. Hover over edge line turns black then click. Type mm size in box that appears and when happy hit enter
[2025-05-01T20:31:54] haku: go to his shop. smack him around.
[2025-05-01T20:33:06] haku: need to make nice looking vesc mount. im thinking with esp32 display too or voltage meter
[2025-05-01T20:33:37] haku: make it look a bit professionally made.
[2025-05-01T20:34:26] haku: im also going to sand and erase the brand fatboy. people look at it
[2025-05-01T20:39:10] Pandalgns: Guys, is there any option or how can I prevent the motor from saturating without having to lower the phase amps?
[2025-05-01T20:49:17] haku: yours 50h 16x4?
[2025-05-01T20:51:11] Noname: Just slap a gay pride sticker over it for now
[2025-05-01T20:51:37] haku: no thats reserved for my standing only rides
[2025-05-01T20:52:34] haku: best marketing if i ever open a shop. money doesnt discrimimate
[2025-05-01T20:53:29] Pandalgns: Nope 😂😂 the halo, 60h 22x3
[2025-05-01T20:56:50] Pandalgns: I increased the phase and the FW and now at low speed if I accelerate to the maximum one of the motors saturates until it gains a little more speed, however if I accelerate a little more gently it does not saturate and once I reach a little more speed it runs well but at about 15/20kmh if I accelerate to the maximum it saturates and the motor jams a little.
[2025-05-01T20:57:33] haku: saturate it stutters?
[2025-05-01T20:58:24] Pandalgns: Yes, if it gets saturated and stutters, it doesn't get stuck at all but it stutters
[2025-05-01T20:58:40] haku: put a temp sensor
[2025-05-01T20:58:49] skrtt: Thats a mini beast right there :p
[2025-05-01T20:59:16] haku: or lower phase. im not a pro just my opinion
[2025-05-01T21:00:33] Pandalgns: The engine doesn't really get too hot, to be honest, after giving it a lot of work the engine is warm but it doesn't get too hot, I didn't want to lower the phase because it runs a lot now 😂😂 350a phase with 460 maximum limit and 125 fw
[2025-05-01T21:00:41] Pandalgns: It's a rocket
[2025-05-01T21:01:47] haku: too rich for my blood
[2025-05-01T21:01:56] Pandalgns: But I wanted to know if there is another solution for saturation without having to lower the phase
[2025-05-01T21:09:08] skrtt: Its not that expensive
[2025-05-01T21:09:14] skrtt: 2,5k i think
[2025-05-01T21:10:15] haku: thats expensive to me
[2025-05-01T21:10:23] haku: i like cheap thrills
[2025-05-01T21:12:18] haku: i bet with my engineering knowledge and Noname fabrication skills we can create a superior "seated" scooter than that
[2025-05-01T21:12:37] haku: and @jamessoderstrom tuning
[2025-05-01T21:22:11] Matthew: Laser can cut pretty thick. Stainless steel when I was in Norway the power their machine had was able to cut 25mm thick. Job i just left used a lot of cutting water jet table for most their parts. They also had EDM machining. Semiconductor plant full of technology.
[2025-05-01T21:25:23] haku: dang 25mm that machine must cost alot
[2025-05-01T21:28:27] Matthew: Yeah, their plant makes a ton of money. Inventory of raw sheet/plate metal arrives and it goes into some robotic storage. They just get on their computer and enter their program and the robot goes to the practical warehouse and grabs the plate it need and comes and lays it out on the cutting table with the laser already has zeroed out to basically click run and then they just go hang out it their office lol
[2025-05-01T21:28:43] Noname: We're a sheetmatal company no sense buying that. But it's impressive what they can cut
[2025-05-01T21:29:08] Noname: It's called a motorcycle
[2025-05-01T21:29:40] haku: tools i need in my future factory. lathe, drill press, lazer multi use and cnc
[2025-05-01T21:30:18] haku: ill call it the giga fuckery factory
[2025-05-01T21:30:40] haku: ill only hire chinese illegals
[2025-05-01T21:31:20] haku: $7 hourly
[2025-05-01T21:31:23] Matthew: Buying what?
[2025-05-01T21:32:37] haku: work for your dam rice or i call ICE
[2025-05-01T21:33:40] haku: bars right there
[2025-05-01T21:34:02] Matthew: Buddy got into laser and got a decent machine. He just got a 3d printer and has been learning on it
[2025-05-01T21:34:29] Matthew: <photos/photo_22933@01-05-2025_21-34-29.jpg>
[2025-05-01T21:34:33] haku: lazer is cool but expensive. i want one just a small one to cut copper
[2025-05-01T21:34:47] Matthew: The inventory warehouse thing is to the right in the pic
[2025-05-01T21:35:50] Matthew: He didnt buy a really expensive laser but it's powerful enough to cut wood and similar thin items.
[2025-05-01T21:36:19] Matthew: More etching items like wristwatch bands. I think he even etched glass
[2025-05-01T21:36:25] haku: nice
[2025-05-01T21:40:44] Matthew: <photos/photo_22934@01-05-2025_21-40-44.jpg>
[2025-05-01T21:40:44] Matthew: <photos/photo_22935@01-05-2025_21-40-44.jpg>
[2025-05-01T21:40:48] Matthew: <photos/photo_22936@01-05-2025_21-40-48.jpg>
[2025-05-01T21:40:51] Matthew: <photos/photo_22937@01-05-2025_21-40-51.jpg>
[2025-05-01T21:40:53] Matthew: <photos/photo_22938@01-05-2025_21-40-53.jpg>
[2025-05-01T21:40:53] Rose: Slow down with the flooding! Matthew has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-05-01T21:41:54] haku: yes ive seen these wooden lazer engraved super cool.
[2025-05-01T21:42:16] haku: i want mine to precisely cut copper to micro mm
[2025-05-01T21:42:59] haku: my battery busses will have penis engravings on the copper. and says made in usa
[2025-05-01T21:48:02] haku: motorcycle needs registration. ours will be seated scooter to bypass laws
[2025-05-01T21:50:04] Matthew: <photos/photo_22939@01-05-2025_21-50-04.jpg>
[2025-05-01T21:50:08] Matthew: <photos/photo_22940@01-05-2025_21-50-08.jpg>
[2025-05-01T21:50:16] haku: thats awsome
[2025-05-01T21:50:30] Matthew: <photos/photo_22941@01-05-2025_21-50-30.jpg>
[2025-05-01T21:50:42] Matthew: <photos/photo_22942@01-05-2025_21-50-42.jpg>
[2025-05-01T21:50:59] Matthew: <photos/photo_22943@01-05-2025_21-50-59.jpg>
[2025-05-01T21:52:03] Matthew: So he obviously got into wood working. My buddy I've known since 6yrs old. We are both 41yrs old. He's a hustler and and a hobbiest.
[2025-05-01T21:52:24] haku: i also want a sandblaster and a powder coater
[2025-05-01T21:53:17] Pandalgns: 🙄 My apartment barely fits a printer and my scooters 😂😂 Others have 50 machines at home, how envious I am, hahaha
[2025-05-01T21:53:48] haku: lets just count our blessings. mines all wishful thinking
[2025-05-01T21:54:29] Matthew: My buddy and his family are pretty well off. He's a biomedical engineer and his wife is an RN with her own practice.
[2025-05-01T21:54:33] Pandalgns: I need a place 😂😂 I want machines
[2025-05-01T21:54:47] haku: i want all the machines.
[2025-05-01T21:55:19] Matthew: I miss my 3 car garage😭
[2025-05-01T21:55:21] Pandalgns: I want a slightly larger CNC to make my own aluminum parts.
[2025-05-01T21:55:40] haku: cnc would be great
[2025-05-01T21:56:01] Pandalgns: Meanwhile I have to settle for a 3D printer 😂😂
[2025-05-01T21:56:04] haku: make your own heatsinks
[2025-05-01T21:56:27] haku: same. hey printers are awsome. only if you know cad
[2025-05-01T21:56:45] haku: unfortunately im a lvl 1 cad engineer
[2025-05-01T21:57:03] Pandalgns: I am level -1 in cad 😂😂
[2025-05-01T21:57:25] Pandalgns: I should look at tutorials to learn since I see that many of you use it around here to design.
[2025-05-01T21:57:35] haku: im only good at making rectangles and squares atm
[2025-05-01T21:57:41] Pandalgns: 😂😂😂
[2025-05-01T21:57:44] Matthew: I'd love a Bridgeport mill. A small lathe. A mandrel tube bender. And a multi-process tig welder... and a bandsaw
[2025-05-01T21:57:45] haku: lol
[2025-05-01T21:58:10] Pandalgns: Come on, what most of us want too 😂
[2025-05-01T21:58:16] haku: mig welder i will buy this year. saving up
[2025-05-01T21:58:36] haku: mig or tig. multi use ones
[2025-05-01T21:59:24] Pandalgns: I use Tinkercad, it's a first step 😂😂 although with the little it has I do interesting things
[2025-05-01T22:00:21] Matthew: Granted there's lots of alloys you can weld with mig.... tig machine will allow you to weld basically anything that's weldable. Just there's a longer learning curve to tig welding
[2025-05-01T22:00:36] haku: i see
[2025-05-01T22:01:13] Pandalgns: You can even weld wood to metal😂😂 I've seen more than one person weld a piece of wood, a glass bottle, and absurd things to a piece of metal😂😂
[2025-05-01T22:01:19] Matthew: Tig machine will allow you to stick weld too
[2025-05-01T22:07:46] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_22944@01-05-2025_22-07-46.jpg>
[2025-05-01T22:08:14] Pandalgns: I need a CNC workshop to make those new parts.
[2025-05-01T22:08:46] Pandalgns: I need them longer to put in new engines.
[2025-05-01T22:09:04] Pandalgns: Damn translator, I forgot to hit the button 😂😂
[2025-05-01T22:10:02] haku: 70h will fit
[2025-05-01T22:10:14] Pandalgns: 100h too 😂😂
[2025-05-01T22:10:26] haku: i had 12" 70h 33x2
[2025-05-01T22:10:34] haku: never rode it though
[2025-05-01T22:11:26] Pandalgns: 70h fit, after that the supports must be changed.
[2025-05-01T22:12:07] haku: 33x2 highway speeds. tbh i enjoy 16x4 more
[2025-05-01T22:12:31] haku: my style of riding. the heathen way.
[2025-05-01T22:13:30] Pandalgns: 33x2 is high speed right?
[2025-05-01T22:13:35] haku: yea
[2025-05-01T22:13:46] haku: full gear needed
[2025-05-01T22:14:33] haku: not my style. i want meat crayon sleevless shirts
[2025-05-01T22:15:21] Pandalgns: I like the 22x3, an intermediate between acceleration and speed, hybrid
[2025-05-01T22:16:13] haku: yes. time ill try that next time. but tbh with any winding you can get torque. its just up to the vesc/esc and battery if you can push that much amps i think
[2025-05-01T22:17:55] Pandalgns: Yes, but if I'm not mistaken, high-torque windings handle high amounts of amps better; they don't get as hot, that's what I understand.
[2025-05-01T22:18:23] haku: opossite. high speed windings can handle
[2025-05-01T22:18:33] haku: high torque need low amps
[2025-05-01T22:18:49] haku: need fw to compensate from my understanding
[2025-05-01T22:19:31] haku: im not a motor pro.
[2025-05-01T22:19:39] Matthew: That or 30-32s
[2025-05-01T22:19:46] haku: yea
[2025-05-01T22:19:59] Pandalgns: Me too 😂😂
[2025-05-01T22:20:01] Matthew: I think someone mentioned 100km/h with 30s.
[2025-05-01T22:20:09] Matthew: 65h 17x4
[2025-05-01T22:20:34] haku: jeez thats nuts
[2025-05-01T22:20:45] haku: i think that be @Un_Jason
[2025-05-01T22:20:49] Noname: A large lazer
[2025-05-01T22:21:25] haku: hey hey hey. look at my old posts it was my idea to have a lazer first. 2023
[2025-05-01T22:21:33] haku: no monies
[2025-05-01T22:22:15] Matthew: It just makes sense for certain industries. The company i was with at the time is IMS Watertight Doors. Their main base is Norway.
[2025-05-01T22:23:44] Matthew: I have a 65h 22x3 collecting dust
[2025-05-01T22:23:56] Noname: Well it fits, just need to shim it. 30$ end mill for 4 seconds work
[2025-05-01T22:26:55] Pandalgns: Wwwhhhhyyy!!! Don't let those motors gather dust! Do crazy projects, even if u put 65h for your 5-year-old's scooter 😂😂😂
[2025-05-01T22:27:59] Noname: Statorade or ferrofluid mabey
[2025-05-01T22:33:38] Matthew: Hehe. I'm trying to figure out what to do with stuff. I have 4 11" motors yume y11 collecting dust. I have 2 vsett motors collecting dust. Plans are the g30 sn 2.0 gets my 65h 17x4 motor. And getting an internal battery made for it 20s. G30lp will then be using my 52v battery and likely getting me an alu lite ubox to run it since I can't revive my 85150. For my yume y11 it's going to have 16s 63Ah 180amps battery.. not sure if I want to get a ubox 85240 or a different controller. I don't intend on just frying the motors but I have multiple backups. Would a 65h 22x3 work on a scooter that's 11 inch design?
[2025-05-01T22:36:01] Pandalgns: What do you mean if it would work?
[2025-05-01T22:36:39] Pandalgns: Crazy things happen here, if you can imagine it in your head, it can be done.
[2025-05-01T22:37:14] haku: @jamaludin_algarnati why when working on standing scooters i have this urge? is this normal behaviour?
[2025-05-01T22:38:20] Matthew: Yeah, I see some crazy builds. I'm just new to all this. Been learning from you guys for about maybe a year now. Before that I had a factory g30lp with shfw. So that's why I sometimes ask some pretty odd questions
[2025-05-01T22:40:26] Pandalgns: Papi here we all learn more and more from each other 😂😂 I also ask strange questions and I must have been more or less like you here in the group
[2025-05-01T22:40:49] Matthew: 125fw 😮
[2025-05-01T22:41:45] Matthew: I used saturation compensation in vesc tool. 10% seems to be good for me. I can start off full throttle and not have issues
[2025-05-01T22:44:46] Pandalgns: I have 10% too, I think, I might try to raise it up to 15% but I think more than that is not good or does not work well.
[2025-05-01T22:47:04] Noname: Back when we thought shfw was amazing power gains 😆 good ole days
[2025-05-01T22:48:31] Pandalgns: Many people still think so, especially here in Spain where there are many Xiaomi lovers 😂😂
[2025-05-01T22:50:39] Matthew: It's wild the difference. Just getting onto my yume 1st time running single motor 3kw was like whoa🤯
[2025-05-01T22:51:52] Matthew: I read somewhere if I'm not mistaken that if youre having to go over 10% there's something in your tune not right. But I'm not a pro with this stuff by any means
[2025-05-01T22:52:08] Noname: Rode a tuned vsett 10 at 8kw and though it was a freaking spaceship mine felt like a snail after that
[2025-05-01T22:53:42] Pandalgns: 😂😂 I don't know how much I'm rolling right now, in the air it gives me about 11/12kw on the ground I don't know, but now anything less seems slow and boring to me 😂😂
[2025-05-01T22:53:42] Matthew: Same. I put statorade in my single vsett motor and somehow highest power pull was 10.3kw on 18s. Blew my mind. Then I went dual vsett and my world changed lol
[2025-05-01T22:54:23] Noname: 10kw is now boring to me. Goal is 16+ on my 11
[2025-05-01T22:54:37] Matthew: My dual motor yume y11 was mind blowing before I modified my g30lp. Now the yume is weak lol
[2025-05-01T22:55:05] Pandalgns: Jajajajaja vesc power! 💪
[2025-05-01T22:55:35] Noname: I love watching friends try it though. I was told my regen brakes are absurd and totally unnessacary 😆
[2025-05-01T22:56:15] Noname: 90a dual motor it's a bit much for a noob
[2025-05-01T22:56:17] Pandalgns: Surely there is something I should fine-tune or improve and it probably comes from the motors without hall, so I imagine that if I adjust some parameter elsewhere it will solve it but I don't know where I should touch.
[2025-05-01T22:56:27] Matthew: Lol. I had 100amp per vsett motor for brake regen lol. Gladly it was variable because damn
[2025-05-01T22:57:25] Noname: Just gotta prepare for decel prob more than accel
[2025-05-01T22:57:35] Noname: Better have a wide stance
[2025-05-01T22:58:52] Pandalgns: I have... 🙄🙄 10a regenerative braking, I don't like it, but to prevent it from jerking and such when I release the accelerator I have to put a minimum
[2025-05-01T23:04:26] Crazy scoots: <video_file>
[2025-05-01T23:08:09] Pandalgns: I feel the pain 😭
[2025-05-01T23:10:06] Crazy scoots: Even thru the sidewall
[2025-05-01T23:12:33] Pandalgns: Time to buy more powerful engines 😈

[2025-05-01T23:31:46] Noname: Couldn't possibly have any less torque
[2025-05-01T23:48:13] Noname: Ugh, when your already fat and ugly the nose ring doesn't improve anything.

[2025-05-03T05:15:08] Noname: Yeah the inner part is rounded that's just a lot of rubber there
[2025-05-03T05:15:30] Noname: Is it safe to roll around on burnout tires?
[2025-05-03T05:33:24] haku: i consider it slicks for the poor
[2025-05-03T05:36:02] haku: around other caucassians im very elegant and courteus. but around other asians i ching chong talk them. spit on the street and squat while vaping
[2025-05-03T05:36:43] haku: covid and kpop ruined it for the asians.
[2025-05-03T05:36:57] skrtt: Spitting on the ground is crazy
[2025-05-03T05:38:09] haku: speaking of kpop. @Un_Jason you listen to that?
[2025-05-03T05:38:47] Jason: nah
[2025-05-03T05:38:54] Jason: not much
[2025-05-03T05:39:15] haku: i dont get todays asian culture
[2025-05-03T05:39:29] haku: back in nam we used to be men
[2025-05-03T05:39:56] haku: feared in undurground tunnels. now we are ladyboys
[2025-05-03T05:40:13] skrtt: Things change ig :p
[2025-05-03T05:41:44] haku: rooftop koreans in LA riots was peak asian
[2025-05-03T11:14:03] Rose: Hey there .​, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-05-03T11:16:54] RicharDON: Hi guys, I have a mantis 10 single motor vesc 60v 18ah, I tried to configure it myself and when I accelerate suddenly the scooter gets stuck there and the motor starts jerking, can someone help me with the configuration?
[2025-05-03T11:56:39] Jason: <photos/photo_22968@03-05-2025_11-56-39.jpg>
[2025-05-03T11:56:42] Jason: the batts are massive
[2025-05-03T11:56:44] Jason: 60V 45Ah
[2025-05-03T11:56:58] Jason: I gotta put dual vesc on it
[2025-05-03T11:58:37] Jason: also found why front wasn't moving yellow hall wire was severed
[2025-05-03T11:58:48] Jason: vesc can do sensorless fine so not a problem
[2025-05-03T14:24:14] BBC: It's a 6mos so probably 120max but with some tuning could maybe hit 180-200 phase perhaps?
[2025-05-03T14:33:48] L000: What about beta for iPhone, can’t pair my vesc because I’m on 6.0.6
[2025-05-03T14:39:06] Mirono escooters: You can't side load it, it's only official appstore
[2025-05-03T15:28:29] skrtt: Is this true?
[2025-05-03T16:51:02] L000: Okay
[2025-05-03T16:51:09] L000: How can I exit limited mode ?
[2025-05-03T16:52:46] Mirono escooters: Have vesc app and scooter on same vesc version
[2025-05-03T16:53:06] L000: Where can I find apk for 6.06 ?
[2025-05-03T17:00:19] L000: Nvm found it
[2025-05-03T18:22:39] Matthew: Some of the cheaper tires just need a little scuffing to remove mold flash to have a nice sealing surface with the bead. Extremely common in the tire world. I honestly haven't touch a cheap car tire in a long time. I used to use perrelli, falcon, nexen, bfg g-force sport comp 2. Other tires I've used but the tires I listed were tires I actually found better than most. Michelin tires are good but way overpriced. I do know that the tire technicians absolutely HATED changing my perrelli tires because the sidewalls were stiff af and low profile at size 295/30zr19
[2025-05-03T18:23:54] haku: oh yea. car tires are different.
[2025-05-03T18:25:40] haku: for car tires im okay with yokohama.
[2025-05-03T18:25:50] Matthew: The biggest heartbreak i had when I got my first vsett motor was finding out it was 6" rim and all I owned is a ton of different 6.5" tires 😭
[2025-05-03T18:26:01] haku: back then. now whatever they have on sale ill buy
[2025-05-03T18:26:51] L000: When I drive with Field wearing my motor is very loud and vibrates what could be the issue v
[2025-05-03T18:32:59] Jason: too much fwk?
[2025-05-03T18:33:04] Jason: or imbalanced?
[2025-05-03T18:33:07] Jason: or too much amps
[2025-05-03T18:33:13] Jason: it kinda depends on what sound
[2025-05-03T18:37:07] L000: It vibrates
[2025-05-03T18:37:15] L000: Or maybe cause I’m on beta
[2025-05-03T18:37:19] Jason: like how
[2025-05-03T18:37:28] Jason: behavior was exactly same
[2025-05-03T18:37:43] Jason: im running 6.06 beta with 6.05 setting
[2025-05-03T18:37:56] L000: Same
[2025-05-03T18:37:58] Jason: what kind of vibration, like cogging?
[2025-05-03T18:38:06] L000: Only fwk is a bit lower
[2025-05-03T18:38:12] L000: Yeah
[2025-05-03T18:38:22] Jason: what's your observer?
[2025-05-03T18:38:28] Jason: and zero switching frequency
[2025-05-03T18:38:30] L000: Ortega original
[2025-05-03T18:38:38] L000: Where do I check
[2025-05-03T18:38:41] Jason: wait
[2025-05-03T18:38:46] Jason: zero vector frequency
[2025-05-03T18:38:58] Jason: should be on same page with observer
[2025-05-03T18:39:06] L000: Ahh
[2025-05-03T18:39:08] L000: 30khz
[2025-05-03T18:39:10] L000: v0
[2025-05-03T18:39:18] Jason: raise it to 40 or 45
[2025-05-03T18:39:37] L000: I was on 44 and it was way worse
[2025-05-03T18:39:44] L000: Should I use V0 and V7 ?
[2025-05-03T18:39:53] Jason: idk
[2025-05-03T18:40:35] Jason: mines v0 v7 interpolation
[2025-05-03T18:46:39] L000: <photos/photo_22970@03-05-2025_18-46-39.jpg>
[2025-05-03T18:47:54] Jason: hmm
[2025-05-03T18:48:04] Matthew: My buddy used Yokohama tires and swore by them. I never drove his car and he didnt seem to either know how to drive hard or refused it because what he'd consider driving hard was practically just me cruising home lol. My perrelli and bfg g-force tire gripped hard. I had nice brakes and by time I get home my rotors would be glowing orange.
[2025-05-03T18:48:26] Matthew: Most definitely buy what's on sale anymore
[2025-05-03T19:18:28] Matthew: Is this required to be able to run more than 2 12v lines on the 85250 ubox?
[2025-05-03T19:22:36] Matthew: Also do i need that adapter to be able to use the spin throttle with the function buttons?
[2025-05-03T19:23:19] Matthew: This guy
[2025-05-03T19:26:21] Matthew: Has anyone recently purchased a vesc express?
[2025-05-03T19:30:30] Smart Repair: ah, good to know
[2025-05-03T19:35:28] skrtt: @jamaludin_algarnati. Do u know why one of the motor u sent me wont rotate?
[2025-05-03T19:35:31] Smart Repair: What do you want to use the keys for?
[2025-05-03T19:35:45] Smart Repair: why do you ask?
[2025-05-03T19:40:51] Yamal: Hey!
[2025-05-03T19:41:20] Yamal: Really don’t know ,, rare,, they work well,, just don’t have the halls
[2025-05-03T19:42:45] Yamal: Wich frame do you use
[2025-05-03T20:12:29] skrtt: I install the “good” one on a kukirin g4 to make it dual motor. And it works fine. The other with trimed phases dont rotate by hand
[2025-05-03T20:12:52] skrtt: Maybe its because the open phase wires are touching each other
[2025-05-03T20:14:19] Yamal: Very Gud
[2025-05-03T20:14:33] Yamal: Dt victor where
[2025-05-03T20:15:31] Yamal: Ferrari and Rolls-Royce
[2025-05-03T20:57:19] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: He encontrado esto en AliExpress: 81,88€ | Spard-SPIN-Y2 de acelerador bidireccional CNC de aluminio, para VESC y controlador común, patinete eléctrico, bicicleta eléctrica https://a.aliexpress.com/_EG9XDW2
[2025-05-03T21:32:46] Matthew: I am trying to build my scooter with the works of being a legit transportation having brake lights, turn signals, horn, headlights, along those lines. Now I just have a horn and headlight
[2025-05-03T21:35:51] Matthew: I received a device and couldn't even get past step 1. Step one is have desktop vesc tool open. Plug USB into the vesc express and it is supposed to be recognized by vesc tool basically instantly. Yeah, that never happened. Plugged it in and nothing at all. I tried different cables. And to make sure there wasn't usb port issues I tried multiple other devices and instantly the laptop notices the device plugged in. I'm actually between fuckin pissed off and sad.
[2025-05-03T21:44:48] Smart Repair: It's best to use the ADC module. Then you'll automatically get the brake signal for the rear light.
[2025-05-03T21:45:58] Smart Repair: Connect Express to your controller and then in vesc tools, click ESP flasher. Express should then be recognized as a CAN device.
[2025-05-03T21:50:53] skrtt: Wym where?
[2025-05-03T22:52:02] Matthew: Usb-c to usb-c ?
[2025-05-03T22:53:17] Matthew: And wifi or Bluetooth?
[2025-05-03T22:57:47] haku: yes i use this but i have the old v2 adc adapter
[2025-05-03T23:04:16] Noname: Saw my guy today. No arrests were made
[2025-05-03T23:15:59] Noname: Damn bent my brake rotor fighting city traffic. Was a fuck show today

[2025-05-04T00:28:56] haku: what in the homosexual shit is this
[2025-05-04T00:29:20] haku: must i explain the science of riding seated here too
[2025-05-04T00:31:17] Yamal: You have Dt victor?
[2025-05-04T00:31:36] skrtt: Yes
[2025-05-04T00:31:39] Noname: Good luck
[2025-05-04T00:32:21] skrtt: Have u ever ridden plus 80kmh on a stand up scooter?
[2025-05-04T00:32:49] haku: 55mph is most ive done standing
[2025-05-04T00:33:09] skrtt: Why dont u like it then??
[2025-05-04T00:33:20] Noname: Tapped mine out at 55mph today
[2025-05-04T00:33:28] haku: lets explain it here.
[2025-05-04T00:33:44] Yamal: I mean we want to see with vesc controller
[2025-05-04T00:34:07] Noname: Need that 20s soon
[2025-05-04T00:34:16] skrtt: Im poor 😭😭 and i just bought a thunder frame
[2025-05-04T00:35:16] skrtt: Poor dog just want to be on video
[2025-05-04T00:35:56] haku: he aint ready for the big time yt clout yet
[2025-05-04T00:36:56] skrtt: Whats his name? Very beautiful btw 🫶
[2025-05-04T00:37:14] haku: white priviledge is his name
[2025-05-04T00:37:50] haku: some times i call him coccaine snow white
[2025-05-04T00:38:02] Yamal: But never forget seat on the e-scooter is unnatural
[2025-05-04T00:38:08] skrtt: At least he dont have problems with police. So good to have him around
[2025-05-04T00:38:31] haku: its time to change that stigma.
[2025-05-04T00:38:45] skrtt: Its not a stigma.
[2025-05-04T00:39:17] Yamal: hehehe
[2025-05-04T00:39:20] haku: i dont know man. i just like to sit.
[2025-05-04T00:39:29] skrtt: Is very weird and unbalanced to have a steat on a scooter. Its not like a motorcycle or moped
[2025-05-04T00:39:44] haku: i see.
[2025-05-04T00:39:58] haku: my wepoor is seated scooter. very balanced
[2025-05-04T00:40:09] Yamal: Soon i go for see the gym there are here..
[2025-05-04T00:41:55] skrtt: I dunno what wepoor looks like
[2025-05-04T00:42:44] skrtt: But i think the “chinese” 13inch “ti-30” scooter are a little better with a seat
[2025-05-04T00:43:08] Noname: @Bradhaku we were battling city traffic ain't no way I'd do that sitting.
[2025-05-04T00:43:31] Noname: Not for the weak
[2025-05-04T00:43:40] skrtt: @jamaludin_algarnati

[2025-05-04T00:44:48] Yamal: RFP PERFORMANCE
[2025-05-04T00:44:55] skrtt: The battery is made the conventional way?
[2025-05-04T00:45:04] skrtt: Like cells vertically
[2025-05-04T00:46:09] Yamal: Nop
[2025-05-04T00:47:04] Yamal: the cells are crossed
[2025-05-04T00:47:38] skrtt: Yes
[2025-05-04T00:47:45] skrtt: But vertically yeah?
[2025-05-04T00:47:52] Yamal: You have Dt thunder frame ?
[2025-05-04T00:48:29] skrtt: Arriving prob monday
[2025-05-04T00:49:08] skrtt: Like this?
[2025-05-04T00:49:52] Yamal: Not long ago, there was a very nice Thunder 24s9p/3shull/80h here, but the owner sold it quickly
[2025-05-04T00:50:00] skrtt: Have u seen adry thunder btw??
[2025-05-04T00:50:35] skrtt: Cl350?
[2025-05-04T00:50:56] Yamal: You really have to be a professional at drumming to be able to put in 11p
[2025-05-04T00:52:03] skrtt: Wym drumming?
[2025-05-04T00:53:46] Yamal: I mean there is very little space, but it can be done; if you are worried about not fitting, 10p will be enough.
[2025-05-04T00:54:53] skrtt: The more range the better thats why :\
[2025-05-04T00:55:59] Yamal: more capacity/more download.. I agree, the more parallels, the better.
[2025-05-04T00:56:34] Yamal: How your new engine going
[2025-05-04T00:58:57] Yamal: Do you have people who make battery in your country? You should visit the Vesc Museum
[2025-05-04T01:04:15] skrtt: Only one guy. But hes busy with jppl big batterys so he dont even lets me send him the cells. Prob need to wait 2 months
[2025-05-04T01:04:41] skrtt: Is there a vesc museum? 🤨
[2025-05-04T01:06:52] skrtt: And i also need to warp the cells but aliexpress taking to long to deliver
[2025-05-04T01:09:56] Noname: Install tmrw or whenever need a valve stem to swap tire. It's gonna rail all week
[2025-05-04T01:11:46] Yamal: JPPL

[2025-05-04T08:38:15] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Acceleration is controlled with the accelerator with the %

[2025-05-04T09:11:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The starting acceleration is good to me but it feels like it bugs down for some reason
[2025-05-04T10:02:31] Jason: up to 32a(7kw) so way more than enough
[2025-05-04T10:08:23] Dualtron Achilleus: Does it happend when batterie get lower?
[2025-05-04T10:09:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes all of my runs I did at like 74v (while I lose 4-5v in acceleration)

[2025-05-04T10:10:23] Dualtron Achilleus: I notices then battery is lower there is like a « vesc security » that made slower acceleration when already at speed
[2025-05-04T10:10:45] Dualtron Achilleus: Like a battery bottleneck
[2025-05-04T10:11:12] Dualtron Achilleus: I lower a bit A battery then it disapear

[2025-05-04T10:11:59] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Don't think it is because I'm with 45a cells (9p) and 220a continues bms
[2025-05-04T10:12:06] Dualtron Achilleus: Its just maybe cue your batterie is at 50% so controlor protect

[2025-05-04T20:02:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Top model ,,Rtv Ultra'' ⭕️I received a couple of questions, is it possible to order this frame? We are currently making a trial version. Developing from scratch is a lot of work. Only practice will tell. We will continue to work on the errors. We know that if they go into production, they will already be improved. ⭕️As for the price, we will resolve this issue, so far it comes out to 500 thousand for one frame. The question is why it is expensive? There is nothing like that there! Since the milling parts are complex and it is not possible to do it on a 3-axis milling machine, we need a 5-axis milling machine, there are few of them in Russia, and if there is, then because of our 10 parts they will not stop their machine, the whole production, to write us a program for our parts. That is why the prices are like that. What comes out for one lever, they ask from 50 to 120 thousand! For one! To make it cheaper, everyone says to order a batch of 100 pieces, then the lever will cost you from 20 thousand. Well, in general, this is with all the milling parts. The result for today is that to repeat this setup, 500 thousand rubles are needed. ⭕️What's with the filling? We made a Drag version. Then something went wrong. We assembled a good everyday scooter on top hardware. ✳️Battery: 64 a/h Prismatics, 26 s (109 V peak) Smart bms Ant 1050a peak ✳️Motors: Rear: 120 mm on 115 stator (traction) Front: 90mm on 115 stator (High-speed) ✳️Controllers: Back: 3shul cl700(350a bat/700 a phase) Before: 3shul cl350(200 a baht/400 a phase) ✳️Brakes: Rear: Rpm dot 5.1 Front: Rpm dot 5.1 Discs 160mm x 4mm ✳️Vesc screen. ✳️165mm shock absorbers Back: 2 pieces Rock Shox Monarch rl165 38mm Before: 1 Rock Shox Monarch RL 165 38mm ✳️Tires 11*Pmt130 ✳️Base power: 33 k watt Peak Power: Up to 40 k watt (You can also raise it Up to 50k watt by replacing the battery with 21700 Molicell, but then the mileage will be reduced by half) ✳️Weight over 90 kg. ⭕️The cost of this turnkey project. 1,300,000 RUB And at least 6 months for production. Naturally, we will try to make this model cheaper to 1 🍋 based on the same fardarivers. There are people who do not want to deal with projects, but buy a ready-made turnkey with top hardware. It will be a good opportunity to take a ready-made one right away and, one might say, individual.

[2025-05-05T01:35:30] GABE: The low speed control depends on the motor also
[2025-05-05T01:35:51] GABE: Idk why
[2025-05-05T01:36:15] GABE: I've tested 250w and 300w and it's night and day on sensorless
[2025-05-05T01:37:03] Yamal: Legal frame is very important for the future..
[2025-05-05T01:37:19] GABE: Also ya It can but if you go stagnant in an intersection you're fucked cos it'll clog

[2025-05-05T01:40:37] haku: agreed. always living in my head rent free that any of my builds can get confiscated
[2025-05-05T01:40:48] GABE: You can still have a transmission on one tbh

[2025-05-05T02:57:58] Matthew: That's how it is with sensorless. You have to give a bit of a kick-start. Go on vesc help and someone there should know how to maybe implement a different way to use the motor. Look up on YouTube about full torque start with sensorless motor.
[2025-05-05T02:59:18] Matthew: This is a video i seen a long while back. Others will hopefully get on here and help you https://youtu.be/H-6qzmeCNtw?si=wT50nVI0p_6qCMzQ

[2025-05-05T04:14:27] Eduuuuuuuuu: Hello, I have a problem with the motor temperature, when I turn on the scooter it is at 25 degrees which is normal, but when I drive for 15 minutes it says that it is at 90 degrees and it goes super slow because the vesc protects it so as not to burn it, the thing is that I am using a 48v 800w nominal motor, in the vesc it is at 25 amps of motor discharge and 50a to the motor phases, what could it be? Is the temperature sensor failing?
[2025-05-05T04:14:36] Yamal: 85/250 Dual ubox
[2025-05-05T04:14:40] haku: 3p can go far in my city. bike lane speeds
[2025-05-05T04:14:55] Yamal: 70h 60h?

[2025-05-05T04:15:12] Yamal: Nice
[2025-05-05T04:15:16] Yamal: ^^
[2025-05-05T04:15:21] Eduuuuuuuuu: I feel that the power is the same as with the original controller, so it is not because of power. Can someone help me please?
[2025-05-05T04:15:21] Yamal: i mean
[2025-05-05T04:15:33] haku: best build yet if im being honest
[2025-05-05T04:15:33] Yamal: Minibike is cool
[2025-05-05T04:15:51] Yamal: but weepor is a big word
[2025-05-05T04:15:53] haku: you get random honks and thumbs up
[2025-05-05T04:16:00] Eduuuuuuuuu: Help pls
[2025-05-05T04:16:25] Noname: Shit I gotta measure a battery box it's 10pm and I'm stuck in chair. I see how it happes
[2025-05-05T04:16:30] haku: federales?
[2025-05-05T04:17:09] Noname: <animation>
[2025-05-05T04:18:22] haku: whats up bud
[2025-05-05T04:19:10] haku: i shall help like i was helped. treat others how you are treated. thats law
[2025-05-05T04:19:15] Noname: Touch motor is it hot?
[2025-05-05T04:19:56] haku: im not a pro but ill try
[2025-05-05T04:20:18] Noname: He cross posted
[2025-05-05T04:20:24] haku: i see
[2025-05-05T04:20:39] Noname: If not temp sensor mabey bad shut off in vesc app
[2025-05-05T04:21:26] Noname: Yeah beta like the fish 🐟 🙄
[2025-05-05T04:24:10] Eduuuuuuuuu: 😂
[2025-05-05T04:25:14] Eduuuuuuuuu: No, when I touch it it is hot because it has been working for 20 minutes, but it does not burn or get very hot.
[2025-05-05T04:25:47] Eduuuuuuuuu: Am used 4000
[2025-05-05T04:25:58] Noname: Then mabey wrong sensor selected
[2025-05-05T04:26:36] Noname: Idk I just messed that up, I didn't have sensors till today
[2025-05-05T04:27:00] Eduuuuuuuuu: One NTC 100k, the other sensors give a reading error of -100 degrees or go crazy and go up and down.
[2025-05-05T04:27:13] Eduuuuuuuuu: Am used ntc 100k
[2025-05-05T04:28:03] Eduuuuuuuuu: The thing is that I don't know what sensor it uses, but the only one that seems to work is that one.
[2025-05-05T04:28:48] Noname: Use can use multimeter and test resistance to mabey figure it out?
[2025-05-05T04:29:07] Noname: I'd just shut them off if your not sure and it's not screaming hot anyway
[2025-05-05T04:29:20] Noname: Just so you don't get stranded
[2025-05-05T04:29:43] haku: i only dwell in the offtopic realm. if i have something of relevance to say i go to general so my appologies
[2025-05-05T04:29:55] Eduuuuuuuuu: I also feel that the power is the same or even less than the stock one, the thing is that with the original I could do 30km straight and no problem, but the vesc detects that it is getting too hot and drops performance or the engine shuts off for protection.
[2025-05-05T04:30:19] Noname: Shitposting
[2025-05-05T04:30:23] Noname: Section
[2025-05-05T04:30:28] Eduuuuuuuuu: How do I do that thing that I have to measure?
[2025-05-05T04:31:32] Eduuuuuuuuu: Resistencia (R): 64.50 mΩ Inductancia (L): 159.57 µH Lq - Ld: 41.45 µH Flux Linkage: 13.09 mWb
[2025-05-05T04:32:32] Eduuuuuuuuu: In my country it is now around 15 degrees cold.
[2025-05-05T04:32:59] Eduuuuuuuuu: and it is not dangerous for the engine?

[2025-05-05T04:38:46] haku: your niu is ideal size though
[2025-05-05T04:39:35] haku: no more expensive project. just cheap thrills for now
[2025-05-05T04:39:47] Noname: Use a multimeter on the ohms setting looks like horseshoe. Then need to find the wire for sensor probably disconnect and measure value
[2025-05-05T04:39:50] haku: whole build will prolly cost 3k
[2025-05-05T04:40:22] Noname: It's the same size at that one
[2025-05-05T04:41:13] haku: nice
[2025-05-05T04:41:17] Noname: Omg I'd be knocking on that guys door for a.segway brand
[2025-05-05T04:42:13] Noname: Push mine into a revine

[2025-05-05T10:25:34] Arnau Martinez Casals: 60v dual 70h speed

[2025-05-05T10:27:32] Arnau Martinez Casals: Running different esc on 70h i have 85250 modified(22s) and in the 50h ones 85150 😳
[2025-05-05T12:24:02] Pandalgns: Is that on the ground or in the air?

[2025-05-05T16:42:12] Pandalgns: Are more watts generated while rolling than while in the air?
[2025-05-05T16:56:10] skrtt: Minimum friccion = almost 0 watts needed
[2025-05-05T16:56:53] haku: clean it first ofcourse. mine i barefoot
[2025-05-05T16:57:12] 'lekrsu': yes but at gym
[2025-05-05T16:57:13] 'lekrsu': no way
[2025-05-05T16:57:17] haku: true
[2025-05-05T16:57:41] skrtt: At least wear some socks caveboy
[2025-05-05T16:58:07] haku: eew. sweaty socks no thanks boy. i air dry
[2025-05-05T17:03:10] Pandalgns: Wow, im pushing 11kw in the air🙄
[2025-05-05T17:28:46] Dualtron Achilleus: Not possible
[2025-05-05T17:28:54] Dualtron Achilleus: Or maybe lot of fw

[2025-05-05T17:40:31] Pandalgns: 10500w... 11000w more or less

[2025-05-05T18:05:35] Dualtron Achilleus: But when you throttle in the air
[2025-05-05T18:05:42] Dualtron Achilleus: And look at rt data
[2025-05-05T18:05:46] Dualtron Achilleus: How much you havr
[2025-05-05T18:13:02] Pandalgns: In power max about 10500 11000w
[2025-05-05T18:35:17] Smart Repair: 9kW dual 85250? That's not much. What kind of battery do you have?
[2025-05-05T18:40:19] Paolo ⁭: Because you don't have enough torque to reach full duty cycle
[2025-05-05T18:41:07] Paolo ⁭: It's normal with same settings you probably see more watts on high torque motor and more motor current on high soeed
[2025-05-05T18:43:15] Arnau Martinez Casals: Molicel 16s 5p bms jk 200 peak 300
[2025-05-05T18:47:21] Smart Repair: 70h 20s
[2025-05-05T18:47:51] Yamal: Nice man
[2025-05-05T18:48:08] Yamal: Your really mount the x12 or no yet,,?
[2025-05-05T18:48:38] Smart Repair: X12 + 85150
[2025-05-05T18:49:10] Smart Repair: 2x X12 + 26s is in progress
[2025-05-05T18:52:09] Yamal: wouh really you have already installed an x12
[2025-05-05T18:53:20] Yamal: Soon you can ride with 300A battery and 500A phase ^^
[2025-05-05T18:54:20] Yamal: 600/1000 xD
[2025-05-05T18:55:12] Yamal: I hope you're not in a hurry any day, especially at 26s x)
[2025-05-05T18:55:23] Smart Repair: But there's still a lot to do until then. The battery + BMS is just so huge.
[2025-05-05T18:56:53] Smart Repair: not pretty, but the BMS doesn't fit in any other way

[2025-05-05T18:57:33] Yamal: Dual 70 h ?
[2025-05-05T18:58:04] Yamal: 22/3?
[2025-05-05T19:02:28] Smart Repair: Currently, 70h at the rear and stock GT1 at the front. I'll try to install 70h at the front as well. I'll have to see if I can get the fork wider somehow.
[2025-05-05T19:09:48] 'lekrsu': Bms fits like a glove
[2025-05-05T19:15:32] Yamal: 2 x33/2 is like perfect for 1000A phase 😭
[2025-05-05T19:17:34] Yamal: I'm really surprised by the power and torque I get with a 600A phase 350A battery, only 20S, so 26s 800/900/1000 phase in 33/2 would be great.
[2025-05-05T19:18:10] Yamal: Anyway
[2025-05-05T19:18:15] skrtt: Ugly ass bitch
[2025-05-05T19:18:34] Yamal: Nice build/ nice scooter / everything nice 💪⚡️👍
[2025-05-05T19:19:32] Yamal: Nice scooters
[2025-05-05T19:23:38] Smart Repair: Originally, I wanted a 70h single. Hence, 22x3. Now, in retrospect, I regret it. You're right, 33x2 would be nice.
[2025-05-05T19:24:18] Yamal: Of course , 800/900 A phase in 22/3 or 17/4 for what
[2025-05-05T19:24:39] Yamal: Can be dangerous i tell you
[2025-05-05T19:25:00] 'lekrsu': What's the wire gauge to survive that?
[2025-05-05T19:25:14] Yamal: With 33/2 is okay like crazy power,, with 22/3 17/4 I don’t know ..
[2025-05-05T19:26:05] Yamal: Any exit from a roundabout or curve, the slightest acceleration can land you on the ground quickly.
[2025-05-05T19:26:45] Yamal: 800/900A?
[2025-05-05T19:26:48] 'lekrsu': Yes
[2025-05-05T19:26:57] Yamal: New Ly engine ,,?
[2025-05-05T19:27:04] Yamal: Don’t know 10mm?
[2025-05-05T19:27:52] 'lekrsu': 7 AWG / 10 mm^2?
[2025-05-05T19:28:00] Yamal: Maybe some competitors use thicker AWG cables.
[2025-05-05T19:28:21] 'lekrsu': My 65H has merely 3.3 mm^2 / 12 awg
[2025-05-05T19:28:27] Yamal: but I think not soldiers from within
[2025-05-05T19:28:51] Yamal: How your scooter going
[2025-05-05T19:28:58] Yamal: Nice Ninebot
[2025-05-05T19:29:00] 'lekrsu': Goes good
[2025-05-05T19:29:14] Yamal: Find bv hehe
[2025-05-05T19:29:27] 'lekrsu': <video_file>
[2025-05-05T19:30:50] Yamal: I need to copy your project into mine, although Francois's project is very tempting as well xD
[2025-05-05T19:31:30] Yamal: James' project would be in another league
[2025-05-05T19:31:33] Smart Repair: 11" 17x4 is crazy... max 90 kmh but brutal acceleration. I can't imagine that you can get that power onto the road
[2025-05-05T19:33:00] Smart Repair: I'm currently reworking the same motor. I'm replacing the phase cables with AWG10. That's the maximum that can still go through the axle.
[2025-05-05T19:34:20] Smart Repair: Reverse gear? Is your axle bent?
[2025-05-05T19:34:42] 'lekrsu': Hm, what?
[2025-05-05T19:35:07] 'lekrsu': That's just shutter speed at 30 fps for you
[2025-05-05T19:35:24] Smart Repair: Your mudguard is moving. It looks like the motor axle is bent.
[2025-05-05T19:36:11] 'lekrsu': Split rim so the PMT is just installed as is, as imperfect as it gets.
[2025-05-05T19:36:59] 'lekrsu': Fender is moving from the movement of the motor, as fender is attached to the suspension as you know quite well
[2025-05-05T19:37:52] 'lekrsu': The amount of movement my old G30 had from tire wobble after 10 kkm+ was quite severe, entire thing shaked.
[2025-05-05T19:42:47] 'lekrsu': That's also just field weakening looping itself, fun to look at. Didn't touch the throttle haha. Took a couple minutes to stop by itself :D

[2025-05-05T21:15:08] Yamal: When you finish it you will be able to go on the highway every day to test it legally, what a blast!
[2025-05-05T21:21:51] Yamal: I suspended my Thumber project due to lack of time and, of course, money. If things continue as planned, I would like to tune a certified and approved DT to ride legally, a candidate for an Achilleus Limited or Thunder 3.
[2025-05-05T21:22:26] Yamal: Also Ninebot g2max pretty cool for build

[2025-05-05T23:28:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Wait those are 35a cells I heard people did with mine (21700la) 45a so that means my battery can do 25kw easy?? (20s9p)
[2025-05-05T23:29:29] Dualtron Achilleus: yeah you can for short period

When I get back I have a pending task and that is to assemble a steering shortener and become skillful with Nami again, I'm looking forward to seeing what top speed it can reach.
[2025-05-06T00:43:10] Noname: Liquid cooling ques. Radiator to block or just a block to block. Mount under front behind forks so it'll get dirt and junk on it
[2025-05-06T00:43:48] Yamal: I really can't believe what I have. I'm very, very impressed with the Nami. The installation of the new engines has been a complete success. Now the Nami is very impressive. I didn't expect it, but it has a lot of power.

[2025-05-06T05:08:19] Noname: I just didn't want to be on FW all the time
[2025-05-06T05:08:42] Noname: I guess the 60mph motor wasn't best choice
[2025-05-06T05:09:02] haku: yours is pretty much a qs273 size motor
[2025-05-06T05:09:07] Jason: it is always accepted

[2025-05-06T06:27:17] Yamal: xD
[2025-05-06T06:28:00] Yamal: Big e-scooter racing competitors use vesc, when they only use the best components
[2025-05-06T06:28:37] Yamal: You already know... VESC is energy efficiency
[2025-05-06T06:29:25] Yamal: VESC is power at its greatest in its smallest dimension.
[2025-05-06T06:30:36] Yamal: VESC is elegance and competition
[2025-05-06T06:32:18] Yamal: Smoothness…..silence…..harmony…..all this together is what you feel when you drive your electric vehicle with a VESC controller.
[2025-05-06T06:33:27] Giuseppe Ferra: Hello, would it be possible to use a tf100 as an accelerator?
[2025-05-06T06:34:00] Yamal: or what it feels like when you can walk next to someone on your e-scooter, that is, you can go super slowly, comfortably and progressively... but...
[2025-05-06T06:35:55] Yamal: When you quickly press the accelerator pedal to the floor, anger is unleashed /// the explosiveness of your engines and you feel the strength and rage...
[2025-05-06T06:36:14] Yamal: ⚡️❤️‍🔥⚡️🔥⚡️
[2025-05-06T06:46:48] haku: 👏
[2025-05-06T06:47:48] haku: vesc is amazing. peak g30v2 so much power in a small package
[2025-05-06T06:51:27] haku: scooters, euc, and eskate maybe small bikes are the best canidates for vesc if your limited in space
[2025-05-06T07:17:13] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2025-05-06T08:20:22] Giuseppe Ferra: How?
[2025-05-06T08:27:55] Yamal: https://youtu.be/sTyY5LgjlEA?si=m897NVo28W2ASJoY
[2025-05-06T08:45:14] Paolo ⁭: Take negative cable (normally black), positive (normally red) and hall cable (normally green)
[2025-05-06T08:55:17] Giuseppe Ferra: 3.3v or 5v?
[2025-05-06T09:14:15] Paolo ⁭: 3,3
[2025-05-06T09:24:23] Giuseppe Ferra: It doesn't work
[2025-05-06T10:09:13] Pandalgns: But what are you looking for? Use the display or just the accelerator.
[2025-05-06T10:09:55] Giuseppe Ferra: Accelerator
[2025-05-06T10:18:58] Pandalgns: And where are you getting the cables from? From inside the display or from the end of the connection cable.
[2025-05-06T10:44:20] Face de Pin Sucé: Sorry, didn't Saw x)
[2025-05-06T10:44:38] Face de Pin Sucé: MHS70
[2025-05-06T11:05:50] Martin Kaktits: Can i set minimum rpm before wich motor wont power on for specific single motor ? I have 2 wheel drive scoot. One has bad halls, the other is fine. Sensoreless is decent, but shitty jiggling when at 0kmh. Im thinking at 0 the good motor would do the work and accelerate enough for sensorrless to become decent, then second motor kicks in (like 1kmh honestly is good enough)
[2025-05-06T11:14:27] Yamal: But with 22s right

[2025-05-06T16:43:09] Jason: I really gotta make new pack so I can charge at 26a
[2025-05-06T16:43:23] Jason: (max current of my charger and it's over the spec tbh)
[2025-05-06T16:44:00] Jason: 3200w charging when it only says about 2900w
[2025-05-06T16:44:08] Jason: lol
[2025-05-06T16:44:20] Yamal: Normally i stop for charger only in the very long routes
[2025-05-06T16:44:29] Yamal: +100km ..
[2025-05-06T16:44:41] Jason: my batts bit small so if I do like 40km in fast speed I have to charge
[2025-05-06T16:44:50] Jason: 30km or less when I climb up hills
[2025-05-06T16:45:03] Yamal: Normally my “Daly” routes between 30/40/50/60/70km..
[2025-05-06T16:45:43] Yamal: But with my 20s10p I can get 100km range with good temp weather
[2025-05-06T16:46:51] Yamal: 40/45/50 kmh how is your autonomy
[2025-05-06T16:47:07] Jason: 30s6p mh1
[2025-05-06T16:47:16] Jason: 100.8v 18Ah
[2025-05-06T16:47:31] Yamal: Crazy
[2025-05-06T16:47:35] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-05-06T16:47:37] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-05-06T16:48:16] Jason: when I went 160km ride
[2025-05-06T16:48:29] Jason: I got like 60km before I had to chsrge
[2025-05-06T16:48:42] Yamal: My record last summer
[2025-05-06T16:48:45] Jason: about 40km/h on most ride
[2025-05-06T16:48:51] Yamal: 400km in weekend
[2025-05-06T16:48:56] Jason: damn
[2025-05-06T16:49:06] Yamal: 200km Saturday / 200km Sunday back XD
[2025-05-06T16:49:10] Yamal: ❤️‍🔥
[2025-05-06T16:49:11] Jason: xd
[2025-05-06T16:49:14] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-05-06T16:49:27] Jason: I theoretically could do more
[2025-05-06T16:49:36] Jason: but I went out of home at 10am
[2025-05-06T16:49:43] Jason: and i was tired at 100km mark
[2025-05-06T16:52:19] Yamal: I like all types of routes, the long routes where you don't care at all and you're well prepared for any mishap, and also the short routes of 40/50/60 km that are more fun and fast
[2025-05-06T16:55:54] Jason: problem is
[2025-05-06T16:55:56] Yamal: I'm lucky to have started in this world, with a very experienced group on routes around my city, the shame is that most of them are inactive and selling their scooters.
[2025-05-06T16:56:01] Jason: I've done like msot of 40km routes
[2025-05-06T16:57:19] Yamal: enough to have a good time
[2025-05-06T16:58:08] Yamal: Many riders in your country right
[2025-05-06T17:01:55] Jason: nop
[2025-05-06T17:02:09] Jason: laws n insurances make people go to motorcycles
[2025-05-06T17:02:30] Yamal: <photos/photo_23080@06-05-2025_17-02-30.jpg>
[2025-05-06T17:03:01] Yamal: And weped team
[2025-05-06T17:03:08] Yamal: What they say
[2025-05-06T17:04:10] Jason: idk
[2025-05-06T17:04:19] Jason: no shimano mt200?
[2025-05-06T17:10:20] Yamal: Don’t know
[2025-05-06T17:15:50] Yamal: Photo is like this :)
[2025-05-06T17:36:58] Jason: mmm
[2025-05-06T17:37:01] Jason: good thing is that
[2025-05-06T17:37:07] Jason: after heavy rain ride scoot becomes bit cleaner
[2025-05-06T17:37:20] Jason: bad part is that some parts get super dirty
[2025-05-06T17:51:51] Yamal: It's definitely better not to go out in the rain with custom e-scooters, I actually take the electronics outside", driving in the rain only with the M365 and the standard Ninebot
[2025-05-06T18:00:03] Giuseppe Ferra: <photos/photo_23081@06-05-2025_18-00-03.jpg>
[2025-05-06T18:00:06] Giuseppe Ferra: But why does he get these results out of me?
[2025-05-06T18:00:32] Giuseppe Ferra: They are totally wrong I don't understand what doesn't work
[2025-05-06T18:03:49] Yamal: hall sensors 50% working :(
[2025-05-06T18:14:24] Giuseppe Ferra: Yes but no. It's normal for him to give me these results
[2025-05-06T18:14:55] Giuseppe Ferra: Anyway they are 48v engines there they are too out of scale
[2025-05-06T18:26:18] Matthew: You want to make sure the motor is completely sealed otherwise the fluid will just leak out. If you know the motor is sealed you can drill a very tiny hole in the out of motor more near the axle. But you want to mark the drill bit so you know how deep the hole is so you don't go into the motor past the motor cover. Grin technologies on YouTube has a video of what he sells. And then i just used shrink free clear rtv silicone to seal
[2025-05-06T18:27:00] Noname: Adding a temp sensor anyway
[2025-05-06T18:42:03] Rose: Hey there Roman, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-05-06T18:58:09] Dualtron Achilleus: Big boy🤗

[2025-05-06T18:59:32] haku: that a fatboy with all due respect
[2025-05-06T19:00:42] Dualtron Achilleus: right
[2025-05-06T19:02:05] Dualtron Achilleus: idk if someone already trie to put 6.5 tire on 7" rims
[2025-05-06T19:02:16] Dualtron Achilleus: there is such a low difference
[2025-05-06T19:12:04] haku: is it okay to listen to justin beiber while working on scooter?
[2025-05-06T19:12:18] haku: need to solder phase cables
[2025-05-06T19:12:41] Dualtron Achilleus: You loose 30nm of torque but yeah
[2025-05-06T19:13:18] haku: no idea. but good motor. what winding and magnet
[2025-05-06T19:14:15] Dualtron Achilleus: 90h and 25 KV
[2025-05-06T19:14:38] haku: lawd

[2025-05-06T19:16:01] haku: its not a competition boys. its a group effort
[2025-05-06T19:16:06] haku: 😂
[2025-05-06T19:17:27] haku: this is what you say when you have 50h 16x4
[2025-05-06T19:23:41] skrtt: First portuguese g4 dual motor 😎
[2025-05-06T19:27:41] Dualtron Achilleus: lul power is more about batterie !
[2025-05-06T19:28:02] haku: all combined. battery motor and esc
[2025-05-06T19:29:34] Dualtron Achilleus: beeing fast is about the pilot😁😆
[2025-05-06T19:44:01] Rose: Hey there Valeriia, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-05-06T20:32:00] Pandalgns: Damn, 3 times today I almost fell off the scooter 😅😅 My engines saturate when I ask for maximum power and they stop suddenly 😭😭
[2025-05-06T20:55:38] Yamal: Be careful cowboy
[2025-05-06T21:02:25] Pandalgns: I need to configure my vesc properly so they don't get saturated or I'll end up in the hospital 😂😂
[2025-05-06T21:05:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Bro be careful with that motor
[2025-05-06T21:06:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Check before every ride sometimes they lose pressure
[2025-05-06T21:06:16] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like the tyre
[2025-05-06T21:06:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: If not one hit to rim and you cry for days
[2025-05-06T21:07:03] ✨🇪🇸عمر: <photos/photo_23084@06-05-2025_21-07-03.jpg>
[2025-05-06T21:07:10] ✨🇪🇸عمر: this?
[2025-05-06T21:09:22] Yamal: But controller okee?
[2025-05-06T21:09:54] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No he is not on that level yet
[2025-05-06T21:10:13] haku: show rt data. how much you pushing
[2025-05-06T21:10:16] Yamal: I hope when i go visit my father to Leon can go Asturias and we can have route there
[2025-05-06T21:10:29] Yamal: From 2020 never back Leon
[2025-05-06T21:10:32] haku: maybe lower phase a bit
[2025-05-06T21:10:38] Yamal: And I need to back
[2025-05-06T21:11:34] ✨🇪🇸عمر: 🤣🤣🤣
[2025-05-06T21:11:54] Pandalgns: The problem is that the vesc app I have on my phone, I don't know why it doesn't work well, I get connection errors or something like that and it disconnects every now and then, it doesn't even read the parameters I have configured from the PC.
[2025-05-06T21:12:46] 'lekrsu': Using the right vesc tool version?
[2025-05-06T21:13:16] Pandalgns: It could be, with gear 2 at 150a phase the motor does not saturate but when I put gear 3 at 350a phase it saturates 🙄🙄
[2025-05-06T21:14:12] Pandalgns: On my PC I have version 6.06 beta, I think, but I don't know about my mobile. Can anyone advise me on which latest stable version to use?
[2025-05-06T21:14:28] 'lekrsu': 6.06 is needed on mobile, you have Android right?
[2025-05-06T21:14:34] 'lekrsu': iOS does not have a 6.06 beta version
[2025-05-06T21:14:34] Pandalgns: Yes
[2025-05-06T21:14:40] Yamal: 350 phase… hehe
[2025-05-06T21:14:45] Pandalgns: Samsung powah!
[2025-05-06T21:14:49] Pandalgns: 😂😂
[2025-05-06T21:14:54] 'lekrsu': https://vesc-project.com
[2025-05-06T21:15:17] 'lekrsu': Make an account on the official VESC website and "buy" the 0€ version, then download the vesc_tool_BETA_ALL.zip
[2025-05-06T21:16:23] 'lekrsu': I caaan just send the zip but you should grab it there directly as its where updates are automatically compiled for you.
[2025-05-06T21:18:22] Yamal: Have you started working on the summer garden or not yet? :)
[2025-05-06T21:19:39] 'lekrsu': It's growing by itself )), sowing grass rn
[2025-05-06T21:20:08] Yamal: Grass,,?
[2025-05-06T21:20:38] 'lekrsu': Yeah, we're fixing the dirt patches :O
[2025-05-06T21:20:41] 'lekrsu': <photos/photo_23086@06-05-2025_21-20-41.jpg>
[2025-05-06T21:22:39] Yamal: I must start as soon as I arrive in my city
[2025-05-06T21:24:24] Yamal: and I would like to buy some more extra chickens :)
[2025-05-06T22:08:46] skrtt: Kukirin g4 master 🤪
[2025-05-06T23:02:36] haku: segway boys its this guy right here! get him
[2025-05-06T23:20:46] Yamal: Last day here
[2025-05-06T23:27:17] Unknown: no helmet no protection no notting
[2025-05-06T23:27:50] haku: like yours truly
[2025-05-06T23:39:20] Unknown: me no
[2025-05-06T23:39:24] Unknown: i like life
[2025-05-06T23:56:10] haku: i should start respecting peak g30v2. need helmet for it.
[2025-05-07T00:00:11] Yamal: Yes
[2025-05-07T00:00:33] Yamal: Also add have brakes
[2025-05-07T00:01:02] haku: yes. thats next step
[2025-05-07T00:01:30] haku: regen-ebrake working good so good you get comfortable with out physical brakes
[2025-05-07T00:02:01] haku: but just incase good to have mt5 or other 4 piston
[2025-05-07T00:03:11] Yamal: Nice
[2025-05-07T00:03:43] Yamal: Original electric cowboy
[2025-05-07T00:04:17] skrtt: Any ideias how to take this bolt? 🥲
[2025-05-07T00:04:45] Yamal: Yes
[2025-05-07T00:05:00] skrtt: A drill?
[2025-05-07T00:05:05] haku: dremmel then use use screwdriver
[2025-05-07T00:05:17] skrtt: Wtf is dremmel?
[2025-05-07T00:05:27] haku: mini rotary tool
[2025-05-07T00:05:39] skrtt: Big boy deck :p
[2025-05-07T00:05:58] Yamal: flathead screwdriver that is almost the size of a Thor's head
[2025-05-07T00:06:27] skrtt: Manual screw driver?
[2025-05-07T00:06:31] Yamal: You hit it so that it fits under pressure and that's it, you can take it out.
[2025-05-07T00:06:37] haku: flat like yamal said
[2025-05-07T00:06:55] haku: that too might break though
[2025-05-07T00:07:08] skrtt: I dont have proper tools down here
[2025-05-07T00:07:09] skrtt: :/
[2025-05-07T00:07:31] Yamal: -_-
[2025-05-07T00:08:58] skrtt: Im not at home and i didnt bring all tools
[2025-05-07T00:09:31] Yamal: Must wait for arrive home ,,,?
[2025-05-07T00:09:42] Yamal: Why you need to take out
[2025-05-07T00:09:53] Yamal: Now..
[2025-05-07T00:10:03] skrtt: To mount it on victor
[2025-05-07T00:10:11] skrtt: Cuz i can’t control myself :p
[2025-05-07T00:10:55] skrtt: Stupid bolt fucked up my allen key :(
[2025-05-07T00:11:00] skrtt: Frame wont come home with me
[2025-05-07T00:11:06] skrtt: Its stays in the garage
[2025-05-07T00:12:14] Yamal: It's still not clear to me what parts you're going to use from the Thunder chassis and the Victor.
[2025-05-07T00:13:37] Yamal: flathead screwdriver is the solution
[2025-05-07T00:16:10] Yamal: I miss my scooter !
[2025-05-07T00:19:47] Pandalgns: Use a Thor head a little bigger than the Allen size you have, put it on top and hammer it until Thor's head fits into the head of the screw, this is how I remove all my Allen screws when they get too big.
[2025-05-07T00:20:31] skrtt: Whats a thor head
[2025-05-07T00:20:36] Pandalgns: Wait
[2025-05-07T00:21:02] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_23089@07-05-2025_00-21-02.jpg>
[2025-05-07T00:21:10] skrtt: I googled it and find nothing apart from chris hemsworth
[2025-05-07T00:21:21] skrtt: Hmmm
[2025-05-07T00:21:25] skrtt: Dont have that
[2025-05-07T00:21:30] skrtt: Might call my mechanic tomorrow
[2025-05-07T00:21:51] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_23090@07-05-2025_00-21-51.jpg>
[2025-05-07T00:22:00] Pandalgns: Look how I have this from hammering it
[2025-05-07T00:25:01] Yamal: ^^’
[2025-05-07T00:26:13] Yamal: many fights, but when it ends you rest
[2025-05-07T00:27:08] Pandalgns: Hahaha of course, and if the screw is too tight, set it on fire 🔥
[2025-05-07T00:28:37] skrtt: <video_file>
[2025-05-07T00:29:18] skrtt: They call me inspector gadjet for some reason 😁
[2025-05-07T00:31:07] skrtt: <photos/photo_23092@07-05-2025_00-31-07.jpg>
[2025-05-07T00:42:32] Jason: <photos/photo_23093@07-05-2025_00-42-32.jpg>
[2025-05-07T00:42:33] Jason: <photos/photo_23094@07-05-2025_00-42-33.jpg>
[2025-05-07T00:43:01] Yamal: You just use the box thunder only
[2025-05-07T00:43:02] Jason: about 3mOhm decrease in resistance
[2025-05-07T00:43:11] Yamal: For bigger battery
[2025-05-07T00:43:23] haku: how you do it
[2025-05-07T00:43:31] skrtt: Yes sir
[2025-05-07T00:44:16] Jason: <photos/photo_23095@07-05-2025_00-44-16.jpg>
[2025-05-07T00:44:25] Jason: I cut off the phase wire
[2025-05-07T00:44:29] Jason: shortened it
[2025-05-07T00:44:32] haku: oh i see
[2025-05-07T00:45:06] haku: what motor that 17x4?
[2025-05-07T00:45:24] Jason: yeah
[2025-05-07T00:45:37] Jason: I can fly off scoot reliably with 140a phase
[2025-05-07T00:45:41] Jason: no abs ocp triggering
[2025-05-07T00:45:44] Yamal: How you adapt
[2025-05-07T00:45:47] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-05-07T00:45:55] haku: nice
[2025-05-07T00:45:59] Yamal: Victor neck smaller
[2025-05-07T00:46:24] haku: peak g30 v3 might get these motors. i want it on a wildcat mini bmx frame
[2025-05-07T00:46:55] haku: better tire options
[2025-05-07T00:47:05] haku: but tubes 😭
[2025-05-07T00:47:47] Yamal: But I really don't see myself buying a complete Thunder chassis to use only its box.
[2025-05-07T00:48:13] Yamal: you could have ordered it to be done
[2025-05-07T00:48:57] Yamal: I would clearly use the complete Thunder chassis, I would buy the mast and frame and assemble it little by little.
[2025-05-07T00:49:07] Jason: don't hate on tubes
[2025-05-07T00:49:22] Jason: when you mount splitrim correctly you will rarely get punctures
[2025-05-07T00:50:12] Yamal: The Thunder chassis is well-sized and comfortable. You also have the option of installing 11" engines.
[2025-05-07T00:50:54] haku: i have vsett 9+ ptsd
[2025-05-07T00:51:26] haku: no hate. just a traumatic experience
[2025-05-07T00:52:15] haku: even when i sold it and put proper tubes on it buyer called me a week later to fix it haha
[2025-05-07T00:52:25] haku: gotcha
[2025-05-07T00:52:42] haku: it has halls the vsett 10?
[2025-05-07T00:53:10] haku: great
[2025-05-07T00:53:42] haku: agreed.
[2025-05-07T00:54:19] haku: im a cheapskakes anyways. always cheap thrills
[2025-05-07T00:54:27] skrtt: How?? I need a wider deck not bigger in length
[2025-05-07T00:55:26] haku: by cheapskakes i mean broke
[2025-05-07T00:57:00] Yamal: I mean, the front and rear support of the Victor is smaller than that of the Trueno, so you'll have to make some kind of adaptation.
[2025-05-07T00:57:13] skrtt: Sorry but its the same. 7,5cm in the bottom
[2025-05-07T00:57:42] skrtt: Thats why i bought this. Cheaper and easier to do just plug and play for 200€
[2025-05-07T00:58:08] Yamal: The same ,,?
[2025-05-07T00:58:11] Yamal: Wouh
[2025-05-07T00:58:19] Yamal: Okays
[2025-05-07T00:58:38] Yamal: That’s good
[2025-05-07T01:02:15] skrtt: With 200€ i wouldnt even make the bigger deck
[2025-05-07T01:04:28] skrtt: And the folding mechanism on newer versions is better than t1 also i already have the non folding piece that dont work on t1 stem
[2025-05-07T01:07:04] skrtt: And i will not use just only this two pieces
[2025-05-07T01:07:40] Yamal: What I don't understand is why they would do that, when they could have 11-inch engines
[2025-05-07T01:11:25] Yamal: What do you miss about the DT Victor? Its stem? Its engines?
[2025-05-07T01:12:26] Yamal: The ideal would be to prepare the two scooters separately, 10" vs 11" xD
[2025-05-07T01:14:08] Yamal: Most people use the Thunder swingarms for the Victor so they can mount larger engines... that's why it all seems a bit strange to me
[2025-05-07T01:16:14] Yamal: Only my opinion XD
[2025-05-07T01:18:11] Noname: Never got a flat on my 10
[2025-05-07T01:20:16] Matthew: @SmartRepair_NRW im making progress but stuck on how to configure vesc through vesc express.
[2025-05-07T01:20:24] Matthew: <photos/photo_23097@07-05-2025_01-20-24.jpg>
[2025-05-07T01:20:26] haku: please do not judge me. lifetime burnout warranty it says.

[2025-05-07T01:22:19] haku: tire prices went up 50% in ali i noticed
[2025-05-07T01:23:10] haku: forcing me to buy pmt
[2025-05-07T01:23:58] Smart Repair: Connect Express directly to the computer via USB. Then, right-click the vesc tool on the esp programmer. Connect to the correct com and flash Express. Then connect Express to the esc using CAN.
[2025-05-07T01:31:02] Yamal: solid wheels that are not comfortable at all
[2025-05-07T01:33:29] Matthew: <photos/photo_23101@07-05-2025_01-33-29.jpg>
[2025-05-07T01:33:44] Matthew: The usb doesn't do anything
[2025-05-07T01:40:12] Matthew: When I have the vesc express connected to CAN I can get connected to Bluetooth.
[2025-05-07T01:40:26] Matthew: <photos/photo_23102@07-05-2025_01-40-26.jpg>
[2025-05-07T01:40:35] Matthew: Then theres this
[2025-05-07T01:40:51] Matthew: <photos/photo_23103@07-05-2025_01-40-51.jpg>
[2025-05-07T01:41:37] Matthew: I'm assuming usb-c port is not good. Because nothing happens with usb-c plugged in
[2025-05-07T01:44:21] Matthew: Towing car service haha
[2025-05-07T01:50:27] Matthew: What tire?
[2025-05-07T01:51:10] Jason: cst 10x3

[2025-05-07T02:01:18] haku: i will try to fit my 11" tires on this even if i have to shave sides
[2025-05-07T02:03:02] haku: 11"s might change the burnouts abilities
[2025-05-07T02:19:55] Yamal: 😂
[2025-05-07T02:20:53] haku: can you guys do this? this is peak g30v1
[2025-05-07T02:25:20] haku: is this called child endangerment? is this illegal?
[2025-05-07T02:32:21] Matthew: Careful... some woke person gonna have issues haha
[2025-05-07T02:32:41] haku: true. let em call peta and social services
[2025-05-07T02:32:50] Matthew: Haha
[2025-05-07T02:35:21] Matthew: My friend was in the mall with her baby son in the baby stroller. She gets approached by security and they ask her who's kid is that. Someone seriously reported to security that she stole a baby lol. I guess some people forget theres Mexicans that got heavy Spaniard blood in them and they get blue eyes, light brown hair and white white white lol.
[2025-05-07T02:35:39] haku: peak v30v1 still king of the park
[2025-05-07T02:35:42] haku: haha

[2025-05-07T02:41:44] skrtt: I really dont understand what are u saying.
[2025-05-07T02:42:42] skrtt: If i want 70h motor i need thunder arms and the deck i need for big battery
[2025-05-07T02:42:54] Yamal: I mean
[2025-05-07T02:43:10] skrtt: What u mean 11” motors?
[2025-05-07T02:43:11] Yamal: Why no use this
[2025-05-07T02:43:25] Yamal: For use your stem from Dt victor
[2025-05-07T02:43:53] skrtt: Because victor folding mechanism is better that thunder 1
[2025-05-07T02:44:04] Yamal: Ah okay
[2025-05-07T02:44:11] Yamal: Like thunder 2 right
[2025-05-07T02:44:21] Yamal: Now I understand

[2025-05-07T02:45:43] Yamal: But you will to use arms from thunder
[2025-05-07T02:45:46] skrtt: Engines will come with time and money
[2025-05-07T02:45:48] skrtt: Yes
[2025-05-07T04:11:47] haku: these are my 6.5" tire options. i will try to make it fit.
[2025-05-07T04:12:51] haku: i think the middle one has a tiny whole.
[2025-05-07T04:14:00] haku: <photos/photo_23105@07-05-2025_04-14-00.jpg>
[2025-05-07T04:18:16] Noname: Patch it
[2025-05-07T04:23:04] haku: i cant find the whole. need to air both. i dont even know wich tire

[2025-05-07T04:23:52] haku: yes. thank you for the grammar lessons
[2025-05-07T04:24:10] haku: i think that middle one might fit
[2025-05-07T04:25:11] haku: the fake pmt would be ideal though. its rounded shape
[2025-05-07T04:25:32] Yamal: Xuancheng pmt the best
[2025-05-07T04:25:49] haku: i remember when you doubted me when i got it

[2025-05-07T04:31:29] haku: vesc can handle that yea?

[2025-05-07T04:38:24] Noname: Gonna cut pieces for my battery box tomorrow. Hope I don't forget the metal at home
[2025-05-07T04:40:44] haku: enough to get white smoke and yell ayeeyaa!

[2025-05-07T18:10:39] Medhi Cantin: ✌🏻
[2025-05-07T18:12:40] haku: that gulag snow baby
[2025-05-07T18:15:08] haku: my bad i thought this was offtopic
[2025-05-07T18:25:17] haku: nice. what country is this. archetecture on houses is cool
[2025-05-07T19:00:45] skrtt: Whats a good way to paint a frame that dont get fucked with little stones touching it
[2025-05-07T19:01:26] haku: good question. need to do this too
[2025-05-07T19:01:51] haku: my gues is sand then apply with a good primer
[2025-05-07T19:33:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Hey bros
[2025-05-07T19:34:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Remind me why display on uart is worse then display on canbus
[2025-05-07T20:10:14] Matthew: Nothing comes up. It's seriously as if usb-c port just doesn't work.
[2025-05-07T20:10:35] Matthew: Please explain more or send me a video link.
[2025-05-07T20:11:50] Matthew: So, I watched a makerbase video this morning on vesc express connected through can will connect through Bluetooth and allows me to see real-time data. And that's all I can do with it I guess.
[2025-05-07T20:13:09] Matthew: And usb-c to usb-c from vesc to vesc express does nothing. I still haven't even got a red light to show wifi working.
[2025-05-07T20:20:53] Noname: France
[2025-05-07T20:21:28] haku: the roofs are steep
[2025-05-07T20:21:33] Smart Repair: Please take a screenshot and record the order of your actions.
[2025-05-07T20:21:39] haku: and chimneys
[2025-05-07T20:21:43] haku: very cool
[2025-05-07T20:22:48] haku: houses look like its made out of cement too. not drywall
[2025-05-07T20:39:18] Matthew: Ok
[2025-05-07T20:45:13] skrtt: Theres no good primer that works on aluminum
[2025-05-07T20:45:55] haku: i see
[2025-05-07T21:05:24] haku: is there a way to check where the tiny *holes* in the tires without mounting and airing it?
[2025-05-07T21:34:09] Matthew: Not that I know of
[2025-05-07T21:40:04] haku: it will be a pain. tubeless non split 😭
[2025-05-07T21:51:43] Matthew: Damn man. How bad is the leak? I use that brand Muc-Off tubeless sealant on my tires and tubes. It seals almost all small holes without issues
[2025-05-07T21:52:34] haku: no idea. these 11" are 2 years old. i just happen to have it.
[2025-05-07T21:53:00] haku: i will try to mount 11 on my peak g30v2
[2025-05-07T21:55:29] 'lekrsu': There is if you sand it to remove oxidation layer.
[2025-05-07T21:56:11] 'lekrsu': Its greatest properties against the environment is also its weakness to work with.
[2025-05-07T22:01:38] skrtt: Im gonna remove it with a sand blaster
[2025-05-07T22:02:29] skrtt: But i think i will go with that kind of paint that is a powder and then goes to a big oven
[2025-05-07T22:06:32] Matthew: Gotcha. If needed that sealant works very well for me. And cleanup is "easy"
[2025-05-07T22:09:00] Matthew: <photos/photo_23112@07-05-2025_22-09-00.jpg>

[2025-05-07T22:10:21] Matthew: Had vesc tool up and running. Plugged in the vesc express via usb-c. And no luck with anything
[2025-05-07T22:11:34] haku: do you apply before mounting tires or is it applied thru the valve?
[2025-05-07T22:12:16] Matthew: Through the valve with core removed
[2025-05-07T22:14:05] Matthew: Amazon can usually overnight a pouch of the stuff. Im doing new tires and stuff so I ordered a bigger bottle. Kinda excited to get my front stanchions in from geofought to convert the front
[2025-05-07T22:25:03] Noname: Are those tubeless rims?
[2025-05-07T22:25:15] haku: yes
[2025-05-07T22:25:26] Noname: Toss a tube in it then
[2025-05-07T22:25:36] Noname: Or look inside for a hole and patch.
[2025-05-07T22:25:43] haku: i knew you would say that haha
[2025-05-07T22:25:59] haku: i will mount bead and find the tiny hole
[2025-05-07T22:26:04] Noname: Just check for poky object in tire with a rag first
[2025-05-07T22:26:30] haku: i already removed it. i circled it with a sharpie but it disapeared
[2025-05-07T22:26:46] Noname: I just milled my brake bracket with a drill press wish me luck
[2025-05-07T22:27:04] haku: we all getting shit done today boys
[2025-05-07T22:27:11] Noname: At least squeezing the handle has some effect now lol
[2025-05-07T22:28:36] haku: <video_file>
[2025-05-07T22:43:43] haku: 100/55/6.5
[2025-05-07T22:44:13] haku: the touvt is 90/65/6.5
[2025-05-07T22:44:26] Matthew: When I plug the unit to the CAN port i can connect with Bluetooth and i can see rt data but I can't change any parameters. And with usb-c NOTHING at all happens. I was able to flash vesc express from the esp programmer yesterday. So through CAN I can connect Bluetooth to see rt data
[2025-05-07T22:45:43] skrtt: Star dales????
[2025-05-07T22:46:41] haku: yea the pmt stardales
[2025-05-07T22:46:45] haku: clone
[2025-05-07T22:46:54] skrtt: Yeah i know
[2025-05-07T22:47:01] skrtt: Is just the pronunciation
[2025-05-07T22:47:09] haku: why?
[2025-05-07T22:47:18] skrtt: Say with me strá dá lés
[2025-05-07T22:47:19] haku: what?
[2025-05-07T22:47:27] haku: oh i see
[2025-05-07T22:47:45] Matthew: So yesterday what I did was plug vesc express to CAN. I then plugged in usb to vesc 85250 and configured it through there. Both devices show up on vesc tool. I just don't know how the 2 are supposed to work together like a normal nrf port Bluetooth dongle does. Bluetooth nrf port I turn vesc on, Bluetooth on my phone shows the Bluetooth device and it connect and I can change all parameters. With vesc express I can just view a couple things.
[2025-05-07T22:47:48] haku: ive been calling it stardales
[2025-05-07T22:47:56] skrtt: <voice_message>
[2025-05-07T22:48:30] haku: well its a clone. china calls it stardales
[2025-05-07T22:48:39] skrtt: Yes my mistake
[2025-05-07T22:48:41] skrtt: Sorry
[2025-05-07T22:57:35] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Magnet size someone knows?
[2025-05-07T23:03:37] Matthew: Thank you so much. Will try this when I get back to my home
[2025-05-07T23:04:39] Matthew: I think haku says they're 50h. I have "3000" watt 60v
[2025-05-07T23:05:39] Matthew: I have the yume y11. No one from yume or yume groups has had an answer for magnet size
[2025-05-07T23:07:28] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Noobs
[2025-05-07T23:07:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Just open the motor and see haha
[2025-05-07T23:07:48] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's not mine
[2025-05-07T23:07:48] haku: oh i didnt know theres a 90 wide. thanks
[2025-05-07T23:08:04] haku: <video_file>
[2025-05-07T23:08:30] haku: if 60v it might be 50h. im not sure. laotie uses 50h
[2025-05-07T23:08:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Nail ?
[2025-05-07T23:08:57] haku: no idea. its been a long time since i used this tire
[2025-05-07T23:09:18] haku: thats 50h
[2025-05-07T23:09:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: If u ware close I'd give u one I have spare now
[2025-05-07T23:09:34] haku: maybe not sute
[2025-05-07T23:09:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Have one ulip slick
[2025-05-07T23:09:51] haku: thanks
[2025-05-07T23:10:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And one I don't remember haha I think its cst or touvot
[2025-05-07T23:10:45] Matthew: That requires work lol. I guess I will soon find out when I go to put a 13" tire in the front
[2025-05-07T23:11:04] haku: question is should i patch flat or use that plug? Noname
[2025-05-07T23:12:29] Noname: Mind you the battery is 1 of 2
[2025-05-07T23:12:39] Matthew: Patch. Never plug
[2025-05-07T23:13:09] haku: thats severe if your lost
[2025-05-07T23:13:24] haku: you know what i mean boy
[2025-05-07T23:13:36] Noname: I've had a plug in my truck for years. I'm not taking that tire off
[2025-05-07T23:13:39] Matthew: I have many of those tires I can send you that are new. Dualtron and touvot
[2025-05-07T23:13:53] Noname: Vid loading
[2025-05-07T23:14:01] haku: oh i see
[2025-05-07T23:14:09] Matthew: It works for sure. Just not a practice ive ran with.
[2025-05-07T23:14:18] Noname: Sorry I live in a tree
[2025-05-07T23:15:54] Noname: You ever put like 14 plugs in a sidewall on an atv and go riding?
[2025-05-07T23:16:09] haku: <video_file>
[2025-05-07T23:17:57] Noname: Ok video will load by Tuesday I swear
[2025-05-07T23:18:01] Matthew: I was just taught in school to use patch that a plug is just meant to get you to a shop. But plugs essentially become one with the tire so if no leaks youre fine. Also mind you ive been around supercharged Chevy camaro z28 doing burnouts with steel belts exposed making spark and the a 150mph quick run and brakes pressed so hard when he got into the parking lot his pads were on fire lol. Tech students have shown me theres lots of forgiveness in the tire industry
[2025-05-07T23:21:48] skrtt: Dont have 90 only 100
[2025-05-07T23:28:04] haku: there is 2 holes. i sprayed it with water. maybe 3 fuck me
[2025-05-07T23:29:25] haku: need 3 plugs. like a girl

[2025-05-08T00:39:55] 'lekrsu': PMT almost feels like a flat when it's inflated, it's so squishy
[2025-05-08T00:41:29] Jason: qell
[2025-05-08T00:41:31] Jason: esc went kaboom again
[2025-05-08T00:41:36] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-05-08T00:42:04] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2025-05-08T00:48:57] Jason: @lekrsu
[2025-05-08T00:49:56] 'lekrsu': Bit too much brake current
[2025-05-08T00:50:09] Jason: Caz one or 2 fet went kaboom
[2025-05-08T00:50:15] Jason: I was accelerating

[2025-05-08T00:52:18] 'lekrsu': Lite's thermal is limited by the contact area, I guess.
[2025-05-08T00:52:28] Jason: maaaaybe
[2025-05-08T00:52:32] 'lekrsu': It's really quite small, nothing like 85240 surface.
[2025-05-08T00:52:48] Jason: maybe heat conductivity of alu board is not that great ig
[2025-05-08T00:52:58] 'lekrsu': Its thermal pad inside box, then thermal pad outside.
[2025-05-08T00:53:02] Jason: mmm
[2025-05-08T00:53:26] Jason: maybe it's because thermal pad
[2025-05-08T00:53:34] Jason: paste time
[2025-05-08T00:54:00] Noname: What is this on
[2025-05-08T00:54:01] Jason: cpus can dissipate quite some heat thru smaller footprint so why not also escs
[2025-05-08T00:54:05] Jason: 17x4 65h
[2025-05-08T00:54:07] 'lekrsu': Riding at 50C mosfet temp

[2025-05-08T00:57:23] 'lekrsu': Don't even want to touch Ninebot hardware. It'll just be slow.

[2025-05-08T00:59:00] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2025-05-08T01:00:25] 'lekrsu': Their electric vehicles need some work

[2025-05-08T01:55:56] haku: @jamessoderstrom can i still do motor detect with a slight tire rubbing on front?
[2025-05-08T02:12:21] Noname: It'll cause resistance and read wrong
[2025-05-08T02:12:42] haku: dammit
[2025-05-08T02:12:53] haku: how em i shaving this off
[2025-05-08T02:12:56] Noname: Cut it or grind it
[2025-05-08T02:13:00] haku: <photos/photo_23122@08-05-2025_02-13-00.jpg>
[2025-05-08T02:13:23] Noname: Or bolt the wheel at the end of fork just for test
[2025-05-08T02:13:28] Noname: Looks good though
[2025-05-08T02:13:29] haku: i was going to burnout it
[2025-05-08T02:14:00] haku: have the forks take care of the rubbing
[2025-05-08T02:14:37] Noname: Just move it to end of fork and test. Then push fully in and ride
[2025-05-08T02:15:00] haku: need to bust out the laotie with the wepoor esc and battery
[2025-05-08T02:19:09] haku: nvm wepoor vesc has big bullets
[2025-05-08T02:23:18] haku: ill just go do it like justin bieber said when you nod your head yes but you want to say no
[2025-05-08T02:23:44] haku: after walking heathen dog
[2025-05-08T02:54:32] Matthew: What's a safe phase current setting?
[2025-05-08T02:55:12] haku: depends on motor and battery
[2025-05-08T02:55:44] Matthew: I meant safe phase regen current
[2025-05-08T02:55:59] haku: oh depends on motor and battery man.
[2025-05-08T02:56:05] Matthew: Lol
[2025-05-08T02:56:11] Matthew: Gotcha
[2025-05-08T02:56:25] Noname: ?
[2025-05-08T02:56:31] haku: not a expert okay. take it with grain of salt
[2025-05-08T02:56:52] haku: safety is 3rd priority for me
[2025-05-08T02:57:00] Matthew: Was just scared going through the chat just now and talk about kaboom from regen.... I got scared
[2025-05-08T02:57:14] haku: yes happened to me prolly
[2025-05-08T02:57:27] Matthew: Booo
[2025-05-08T02:57:31] Noname: I'm at 90a regen per motor
[2025-05-08T02:57:32] haku: i dont remember the exact details of the moment unfortunately
[2025-05-08T02:58:17] Matthew: Would 120amp for 65h 17x4 be safe on an 85250 vesc?
[2025-05-08T02:58:23] Matthew: Phasr
[2025-05-08T02:58:25] Matthew: Phase
[2025-05-08T02:58:31] Matthew: Regen
[2025-05-08T02:59:08] Matthew: Im running 20amps battery regen
[2025-05-08T02:59:28] haku: wait for an expert answer. my vote is yes
[2025-05-08T02:59:48] Matthew: Cool. I'll have my ear open
[2025-05-08T02:59:58] Matthew: <photos/photo_23123@08-05-2025_02-59-58.jpg>
[2025-05-08T03:00:06] Matthew: Be nice to me. It's a testbed
[2025-05-08T03:00:23] haku: thats cool actually
[2025-05-08T03:00:52] Matthew: 😁 Hopefully vesc stays nice and chilled now
[2025-05-08T03:01:18] haku: i dont judge and make fun of other folks build. just @SirModAlot because he has none. got em
[2025-05-08T03:01:23] Matthew: I will be doing a nicer clean setup on sn2.0
[2025-05-08T03:01:37] Matthew: Lol
[2025-05-08T03:02:37] haku: his 70h motor rotting

[2025-05-08T03:58:32] haku: ready for motor detect boys. as jank as can be.
[2025-05-08T04:00:07] Yamal: The end what you do
[2025-05-08T04:00:24] haku: change tires to 11
[2025-05-08T04:00:24] Yamal: For the Tyree don’t touch the frame ..?
[2025-05-08T04:00:42] haku: just a tiny tiny rub
[2025-05-08T04:01:25] Yamal: And why detection motor again ,,?
[2025-05-08T04:01:55] haku: no idea. dont you need that when you remove phase cables?
[2025-05-08T04:04:51] Noname: No
[2025-05-08T04:06:03] Noname: Mabey if you shorten the cable or change the connectors but unplugging them it's a bit overkill
[2025-05-08T04:06:19] haku: oh so i can just plug it in?
[2025-05-08T04:06:44] Noname: Rip that bitch
[2025-05-08T04:06:48] haku: you sure even if i dont get phase cables right order
[2025-05-08T04:07:07] Noname: It'll just be backwards
[2025-05-08T04:07:26] Noname: I'm not 100% but I don't see Any problem
[2025-05-08T04:07:41] haku: oh ill check. i unplug battery while janking tires

[2025-05-08T04:09:07] haku: i cant sound like a noob
[2025-05-08T04:09:39] haku: or he might just be annoyed. 2/3 people according to data are anoyed at me
[2025-05-08T04:09:41] Noname: I can't drive that because I use my blinkers
[2025-05-08T04:10:05] Noname: Possible 3/3

[2025-05-08T17:21:04] Noname: That's redicilious temp
[2025-05-08T17:40:17] Matthew: I know. So I have a watering cooling setup i finished yesterday. Just getting my day started and gonna go test ride. It should be fine then.... i haven't had a heatsink on the vesc.
[2025-05-08T18:13:22] Dualtron Achilleus: You put a turbine xd

[2025-05-08T21:23:48] haku: its legit from turkey. i asked for it
[2025-05-08T21:23:53] puneDir: We dont wear this
[2025-05-08T21:24:14] Pandalgns: That looks more like a Sahara style 😂😂
[2025-05-08T21:24:28] haku: oh ok. what is this anyway and is this how you wear it?
[2025-05-08T21:24:52] haku: i have many disguises as you guys can see
[2025-05-08T21:30:20] Yamal: Haku saharaui xD

[2025-05-08T22:23:28] Pandalgns: It's alive!! With an 84100 and a 75100v2 but it's alive😍😍 now to configure it properly and test configurations that I can later apply to the halo
[2025-05-08T22:25:25] Matthew: <photos/photo_23137@08-05-2025_22-25-25.jpg>
[2025-05-08T22:25:32] Pandalgns: Now I'm trying to understand HFI and how to configure it to make motors without Hall start perfectly and not saturate.
[2025-05-08T22:26:05] Matthew: Did a long pull. 45mph. Motor Temp went to 62c and vesc went to 26c
[2025-05-08T22:28:25] Matthew: Im very interested in that.
[2025-05-08T22:29:41] Pandalgns: Yes, and I do, since in the zcougar I have janobike t10 motors without hall sensors and in the halo the hall sensors burned out and I'm going to configure it for now as motors without halls
[2025-05-08T22:31:58] Pandalgns: I'm also testing saturation compensation and start current decrease.
[2025-05-08T22:32:44] Pandalgns: To adjust the start as much as possible and see what parameters can be modified related to the start and saturation
[2025-05-08T22:38:29] Matthew: I seen Benjamin Vedder doing a video with hfi and some made sense to me but im afraid of frying something
[2025-05-08T22:40:37] Pandalgns: Yes, me too, I'm watching and rewatching the hfi video and testing it, but because of that fear I'm testing it with the zcougar which are cheaper parts than the halo ones 😂😂😂
[2025-05-08T22:41:06] Matthew: Hehe. Gotcha
[2025-05-08T22:41:14] Pandalgns: 😂😂
[2025-05-08T22:44:12] Pandalgns: If any Vesc teachers here are reading this and want to give Matthew and me a hand, I think I can speak for both of us if I say, we'll give him a blowjo.....ohh sry I say we'll be very grateful. 😂😂😂
[2025-05-08T23:23:06] skrtt: Hey guys
[2025-05-08T23:24:21] skrtt: Can i pull this two connectors?
[2025-05-08T23:24:38] skrtt: Or are they soldered
[2025-05-08T23:26:53] Matthew: I want to know for knowledge. So far im lucky my motors hall sensors all work.
[2025-05-09T00:44:54] Matthew: Everything works great. But still just Bluetooth... but that's what I was used to so I am happy af 🥰
[2025-05-09T00:47:28] Matthew: My water cooling system worked out really well. How are you planning to do yours? I need ideas to maybe change mine up.
[2025-05-09T00:48:37] Matthew: Yeah. Need some other ideas to maybe mod my new water cooled setup

[2025-05-09T20:11:15] haku: i havent even ridden my g30s
[2025-05-09T20:11:28] haku: i dont even know why i got it.
[2025-05-09T20:11:33] Yamal: Just kidding man
[2025-05-09T20:11:41] Yamal: Wherever 🤙😁
[2025-05-09T20:12:01] haku: if i can get this down to 200 maybe ill do it
[2025-05-09T20:12:42] haku: scrap jetson to stock settings and use that 85/150
[2025-05-09T20:19:34] Yamal: But what jetson use before ?
[2025-05-09T20:19:36] Noname: Send me 1

[2025-05-09T20:23:10] haku: just a chill ride for riding with son and dog
[2025-05-09T20:31:56] haku: question to the burnout dawgs. why does my peak g30v2 doesnt produce alot of white smoke like wepoor?
[2025-05-09T20:32:00] haku: wepoor very dense white smoke
[2025-05-09T20:34:02] Noname: More rubber than nylon tire mabey
[2025-05-09T20:34:15] haku: i see
[2025-05-09T20:35:08] Noname: Also more weight and 2x the wheel speed
[2025-05-09T20:35:51] haku: true
[2025-05-09T20:36:29] haku: but with 10" peak g30v2 snakeskin tires it had more smoke
[2025-05-09T20:39:32] Noname: Get some gender reveal tires idk
[2025-05-09T21:05:06] Matthew: How fast the tire spins, weight, and tread
[2025-05-09T21:10:11] Matthew: I feel them gatorskin style tread gets hotter faster
[2025-05-09T21:17:58] haku: i was checking this out yesterday
[2025-05-09T21:18:20] haku: 85 might be the perfect size without rubbing
[2025-05-09T21:19:44] Noname: Those might suck if they're same as ninebot segway thing
[2025-05-09T21:21:36] haku: oh what is 85? 2.75 inch?
[2025-05-09T21:22:11] Matthew: I owned that specific tire. I had it on the front. If shock dies I do believe on g30 it doesn't run into stem
[2025-05-09T21:22:37] Matthew: They're thin rubber though
[2025-05-09T21:22:42] haku: oh gotcha
[2025-05-09T21:22:47] Matthew: Wall*
[2025-05-09T21:23:17] haku: i need a tire that will fit a laotie rim without rubbing. 90 is good but need some shaving
[2025-05-09T21:23:22] Matthew: Yeah, similar to a thinner tubed tire
[2025-05-09T21:24:16] Matthew: The tire lasted me a long while actually. But it didnt have a motor. Was factory ninebot g30 rim
[2025-05-09T21:24:41] haku: ok.
[2025-05-09T21:33:13] skrtt: Not amazing
[2025-05-09T21:33:22] skrtt: My charging ports dont seem to work
[2025-05-09T21:36:39] GABE: Lmfao
[2025-05-09T21:58:09] Pandalgns: Guys, can anyone tell me how much aperture is needed for the Lonnyo 80h?
[2025-05-09T22:33:16] Yamal: You can order open fork 155mm
[2025-05-09T22:34:35] Yamal: All stock for the moment right
[2025-05-09T22:35:49] Pandalgns: What can be ordered with different distances?
[2025-05-09T22:37:13] Yamal: Normal for 80h i think is 170 or 175/// but you can order 155
[2025-05-09T22:38:13] Yamal: Anyway for me still big”” so i need spacer the swing arms a little more
[2025-05-09T22:39:15] Pandalgns: 🤔🤔 I have to measure, I understand that 155 would be normal for, for example, 60 h like the ones I wear, right?
[2025-05-09T22:39:42] Yamal: Yes
[2025-05-09T22:40:04] Yamal: 80h fly to bye lest g0
[2025-05-09T22:40:11] Yamal: hehe
[2025-05-09T22:46:28] Yamal: Charging :)
[2025-05-09T22:48:06] Pandalgns: I think I know how to fit up to 200 opening in the halo in front without having to modify hardly anything.
[2025-05-09T23:28:58] haku: i need a tubeless split rim. sick of this shit.
[2025-05-09T23:30:56] haku: i will refrain from burnouts for now
[2025-05-09T23:31:19] haku: if i can control myself. guide me new pope
[2025-05-09T23:37:09] skrtt: Yes i think its just the connectors. But i reach 105° in the controller. Something might be wrong with it
[2025-05-09T23:48:39] haku: dam patch came off. i used one for tubes. not the right patch 😭
[2025-05-10T00:01:47] haku: model 3 rental is nice too.
[2025-05-10T00:07:41] Noname: I don't think it matters. Prob shit install did you scuff it?
[2025-05-10T00:15:51] haku: yes. but didnt let rubber cement fully dry

[2025-05-10T00:23:52] Noname: You let it get tacky then apply patch and hold firmly
[2025-05-10T00:24:22] haku: gotcha how long do i hold it for? and how long till i can ride?
[2025-05-10T00:24:57] Noname: Read directions

[2025-05-10T00:26:45] Noname: Yeah it'll be fine in 3 hours
[2025-05-10T00:42:05] haku: this looks good enough. ill give it 1hr to cure.
[2025-05-10T00:43:54] Noname: Did you scuff it with sandpaper
[2025-05-10T00:44:06] haku: yes the tool they provided
[2025-05-10T00:44:11] haku: the scuffer
[2025-05-10T00:48:31] haku: asking for a friend he got some of that rubber cement on his dick and pubes while pissing is that bad?
[2025-05-10T00:49:06] haku: its hard to come off
[2025-05-10T02:30:13] Noname: https://www.facebook.com/share/r/16KHzjgdHs/

[2025-05-10T05:48:19] Yamal: Likewise, as long as it doesn't rain and it's sunny, if you dress well and wear gloves, etc., you can cover up a few kilometers
[2025-05-10T05:50:49] Yamal: Another good thing about the minibike is that it doesn't attract much attention, so I don't think the police will stop you to fine you hehe, I mean the "preparation is discreet" and camouflaged
[2025-05-10T05:51:32] haku: doesnt attract police i agree. but it turns heads
[2025-05-10T05:52:03] Yamal: And this is a good thing in these times, where electric vehicles are emerging and governments and authorities still have no clue how to act :)

[2025-05-10T06:12:52] Yamal: It's been balancing the battery while I've been away, :) ! I left it at 72V with a Dellciff of 0.150 or something like that, I think when I start moving it it will return to its 0.02 values

[2025-05-10T07:12:45] Yamal: Well, I would think of something more discreet like Leksur or Francois 65h, a high-discharge battery and an elegant VESC controller.
[2025-05-10T07:13:07] haku: ofcourse. only vesc
[2025-05-10T07:13:49] Yamal: And if the laws come destroying everything in 2027, I would think about buying a certified dualtron or something big like that to prepare it with Vesc
[2025-05-10T07:14:41] haku: im still waiting on the big dick spintend
[2025-05-10T07:14:49] haku: hopefully they release it

[2025-05-10T18:12:01] chris: Hey guys, I need your help. My battery won't work. But when i plug in the charger. It does! What can it be? Is the bms broke down? Thanks for you help.
[2025-05-10T18:31:11] haku: news on nami?
[2025-05-10T18:46:26] Noname: This is for things like brake lever imput to tail light function, headlight on off and blinkers etc. You can wire a "light" to a switch on your own if needed
[2025-05-10T18:47:00] Noname: What scooter what bms etc?
[2025-05-10T19:09:08] chris: It's a max g30. But all custom. Battery is from 48v ebike,out of the case. I used it for 4 years now. And today, it won't fire up.
[2025-05-10T19:09:31] chris: <photos/photo_23157@10-05-2025_19-09-31.jpg>
[2025-05-10T19:10:06] chris: I remove the shrink tube to look at.
[2025-05-10T19:10:29] chris: <photos/photo_23158@10-05-2025_19-10-29.jpg>
[2025-05-10T19:10:50] chris: There is nothing burned, what I can see.
[2025-05-10T19:11:34] Noname: Unplugging the connector can sometimes reset or what James said.
[2025-05-10T19:12:35] Noname: You can measure each bank power by using that plug. Wire black and red is bank 1 next red red is bank 2 etc
[2025-05-10T19:13:11] chris: I measured all. It's fine. And I drove it for a half an hour. Then it turns off, and won't turn on again. But when i plug the charger. It will...
[2025-05-10T19:13:30] Noname: Temp.sensor messed up?
[2025-05-10T19:14:09] chris: Where is the temp sensor? I think there is no one.
[2025-05-10T19:14:32] Noname: Bottom right black.wire
[2025-05-10T19:15:47] chris: The black and red wire is for switch on and off.
[2025-05-10T19:16:00] chris: On the bottom I mean
[2025-05-10T19:16:19] chris: <photos/photo_23159@10-05-2025_19-16-19.jpg>
[2025-05-10T19:16:38] chris: These two wires are for on and off switch.
[2025-05-10T19:19:04] chris: I think I must install the original battery. Is there a way to have an on and off switch with the original battery?
[2025-05-10T19:19:46] chris: To turn on and off, using this bms terminal in a way?
[2025-05-10T19:19:57] chris: <photos/photo_23160@10-05-2025_19-19-57.jpg>
[2025-05-10T19:35:56] Noname: The black wire tucked in the corner not switch wire
[2025-05-10T19:37:09] Noname: We don't know what original battery is. If it can be switched off it'll have a plug
[2025-05-10T19:38:29] Yamal: Nop man ^^’

[2025-05-10T23:06:17] chris: Thank you guys for your help. I measured all, but I can't figured out. At least there's no voltage coming out of the battery soon. I put in the original ninebot battery. And now I don't have fun for the next few weeks. I have to build a new battery. I think I will go for 16s5p with 21700 cells and a low extender for the bottom of the scooter. Is there enaugh room for the battery spec's and a 84100 hp controller in max g30 lp? What do you think?
[2025-05-10T23:14:50] Noname: This enough heatsink? Idk if air flows by it

[2025-05-11T06:01:17] Noname: Best place for a temp sensor? I can stick under the hall sensor board and it holds it against the coils
[2025-05-11T06:01:30] Noname: That was a whore fishing it in the axle
[2025-05-11T06:09:24] Noname: Idk. It sucks it out of the tube lol
[2025-05-11T06:33:25] haku: never done this but my guess is on the winding
[2025-05-11T06:34:00] haku: thats badass you got a temp sensor there
[2025-05-11T06:34:31] Noname: I added it

[2025-05-11T06:35:14] Noname: I stuffed it being the hall paper board stuff
[2025-05-11T06:35:17] haku: thermal epoxy maybe
[2025-05-11T06:35:39] Noname: Used gasket maker on the back and wire so it wouldn't move
[2025-05-11T06:36:00] Noname: The fiber board holds it down decently
[2025-05-11T06:36:10] haku: nice

[2025-05-11T06:37:09] Noname: But need to fill the air gap
[2025-05-11T06:37:43] haku: no clue about ferrofluid. you should do without first then experiment
[2025-05-11T06:38:02] Noname: Yep in a perfect world sure
[2025-05-11T06:38:04] haku: see if it makes significant change
[2025-05-11T06:38:37] Noname: I have no base test from factory. It's higher voltage, heavier and a bigger tire now
[2025-05-11T06:39:18] haku: exactly. see how it performs without it first
[2025-05-11T06:39:27] Noname: To late
[2025-05-11T06:39:52] Noname: We will test with power level instead
[2025-05-11T06:40:16] haku: i am not 100% sold on statorade
[2025-05-11T06:40:36] Noname: As a 5% shareholder in Haku industries we don't preform in-house testing. Right to the battlefield
[2025-05-11T06:40:47] Noname: Why
[2025-05-11T06:41:04] haku: idk man. seems like snake oil
[2025-05-11T06:41:16] haku: need real world results
[2025-05-11T06:41:20] haku: here
[2025-05-11T06:41:54] Noname: The coil is surrounded by air. Air is a horrible heat conductor. Oil fills the gap and transfers heat to rim.
[2025-05-11T06:42:16] haku: science

[2025-05-11T08:21:27] Yamal: Ninebot frame ? Don’t know
[2025-05-11T08:21:41] Yamal: 33/2 is speed
[2025-05-11T09:18:19] Yamal: Are you already preparing for your summer vacation? (Vesc scooter group) :)
[2025-05-11T09:19:12] Yamal: Good weather, and summer nights are especially great for running kilometers, cooler temperatures
[2025-05-11T09:37:40] Yamal: :)
[2025-05-11T09:42:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Then why tf gpt says higher number higher turqe ?
[2025-05-11T09:47:36] Yamal: Chat gpt?
[2025-05-11T10:08:59] 'lekrsu': You're prompting wrong
[2025-05-11T10:09:29] 'lekrsu': LLMs are trained on data saying these in the wrong order.
[2025-05-11T10:10:36] 'lekrsu': 33x2 is high speed, parallel x turns
[2025-05-11T10:25:27] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_23176@11-05-2025_10-25-27.jpg>
[2025-05-11T10:39:07] Jan: That would imply that 33x2 is lower kv than 22x3, its apparently a notation by flipsky and its wrong. It should be 2x33 and 22x3. The ai gets confused and gives you a wrong answer
[2025-05-11T10:40:20] Jan: <photos/photo_23177@11-05-2025_10-40-20.jpg>

[2025-05-11T10:42:51] Jan: Corrected
[2025-05-11T10:48:24] Yamal: How your projects going Mr Jan
[2025-05-11T10:50:55] Jan: Meh, first idea failed spectacularly in testing. Was stranded with no further idea left, now i got a new solution that should work but its really hard to pull off. Will need at least 100hours and another 500-800$ just for a single attempt of testing to see if that might work or not
[2025-05-11T10:51:16] Jan: If it had worked on the first, project would be finished by now
[2025-05-11T10:57:20] Neo: Going slower
[2025-05-11T10:57:45] Yamal: But you have the G30 dual working, right?
[2025-05-11T10:59:17] Yamal: Nothing, you demand too much of yourself with your single projects! But I encourage you to enjoy the process ^^
[2025-05-11T11:31:01] Jan: Its beyond my skill level for sure but thats how you get better at things you learn in the process
[2025-05-11T11:31:38] Jan: I enjoy solving very difficult problems and finding new inventive ways to solve things
[2025-05-11T12:26:12] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So more wires more speed ? Or it's to do with the turns ?
[2025-05-11T12:37:52] Jan: Its always the same amount of wires
[2025-05-11T12:49:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Hard to understand especially because my language is not English

[2025-05-11T21:52:34] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Overall from someone who didn't use 3chull but looking from aside
[2025-05-11T21:52:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It looks like a lot get burn
[2025-05-11T21:52:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: For no reason
[2025-05-11T21:53:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: For example the cun bus burning I never had that and I use flipsky and spintends that are cheaper it's a shame really because 3chull supposed to be a good contender for nuclear

[2025-05-11T23:41:37] Noname: Nope it's been raining for 2 weeks gotta stop for a rest sometime
[2025-05-11T23:44:08] Nils: Hi. Does anyone have experience with using an asynconus motor(Induction motor) with a VESC. Induction Motors dont have permanent Magnets wich means they always have to have some slip to run. Is it possible to use FOC?
[2025-05-11T23:48:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The Russians said they having problems with the 3chull unfortunately so they move to fardriver
[2025-05-11T23:49:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: ⭕️По проекту RTV Ultra . Не прошло и суток. Как 3shule cl700 сказал Поехали! И взлетел в космос 🛫😁 С самого начала он мне уже не понравился. Так как холлы он увидел с 10 раза. Забирал токи по абс и прочие не понятные движения. ⭕️весь этот проект и делался ради трекшена! А оказывается cl700 и cl350 это разные контроллеры которые не могут работать по кану, это мы узнали уже при подключение. Подключили каждый сам себе. И сегодня выехали покататься. Итог: очевиден выше.🤭 ⭕️Делаем выводы: ̶V̶e̶s̶c̶ на этом все ❌ Хорошее ПО. Но очень не понятное, капризное. Что китайские за 5000 руб. Что индийские за 100.000 руб. Все горит 🔥 даже такой жирный Казалось бы контр, как cl700. ⭕️По мех части самоката возникла проблема с передней подвеской. Одного амортизатора не хватает. (Даже такого хорошего Rock Shox 19атм) накачен на всю и он не справляется. Зад накачен по 12 отлично мягко. От того что перед сильно прожат. Воблинг был на 90 км/ч. Хотя все чертилось с запасом. Значит будем переделывать гусь угол наклона.
[2025-05-11T23:49:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: ⭕️В продаже: 1)3shule cl700 (30с) (Проработал один вечер , сделал пук ) Цена:( договорная, та как вполне реально восстановить ). Отталкиваясь от цены нового(90.000 руб): Минимум:15.000 руб. 2)3shule cl350 (30c) Он работает все в порядке. (В работе был вечер) Цена:35.000 руб (новый вышел под 50.000 руб 3)экран веск от Игоря (Проработал вечер ) Цена:9.000 руб Причина продажи. Переход на Fardriver.

[2025-05-12T01:08:13] Noname: Oh I used my buddy's thermal paste. Temps.stayed like 5c lower and dropped like a rock off throttle.
[2025-05-12T01:09:42] haku: how does he know the recipe?
[2025-05-12T01:10:05] Noname: It's his company they had extra for some reason
[2025-05-12T01:10:14] Noname: Fuch or something
[2025-05-12T01:10:34] haku: i see. hook it up. im on that ali paste
[2025-05-12T01:12:23] Noname: Try giving controllers air first

[2025-05-12T01:31:12] Jason: damn
[2025-05-12T01:31:17] Jason: batts gotta be big
[2025-05-12T01:31:41] Jason: 57.4Ah drawn but still 48%
[2025-05-12T01:31:48] Jason: it's gotta be insanely big
[2025-05-12T01:36:53] Noname: 20s32p 35e 112ah
[2025-05-12T01:37:19] Noname: Was thinking of a 4s20p under the seat for another 20mi lol
[2025-05-12T01:38:53] Jason: that's big ass
[2025-05-12T01:39:13] Jason: if i had that much space
[2025-05-12T01:39:22] Jason: I would've put my 63Ah cells to use
[2025-05-12T01:51:43] Noname: Moped is stupid heavy now. It throws you back a bit on accel prob 350# with my 190 on it and charger and junk nearing 600
[2025-05-12T01:52:53] Noname: It's hard to get it on the center stand. No more off road exploring as I can't lift it over trees now.
[2025-05-12T01:54:16] Noname: If I could have done this differently 32s20p seven controller and a torque/speed motor.
[2025-05-12T01:55:37] Noname: Range is my biggest thing. I'd just get a gas scooter and be done but friends group ride electric.

[2025-05-12T06:42:38] Noname: Need that 10kw 😆
[2025-05-12T06:42:46] Yamal: That's a lot of kilometers, great for long routes and being able to travel without having to constantly charging it
[2025-05-12T06:43:19] Yamal: So
[2025-05-12T06:43:29] Yamal: Start the aventure hehe
[2025-05-12T06:43:42] Noname: About 70mi and you start noticing a loss of power. Still very capable though
[2025-05-12T06:44:08] Noname: Yes had a nice day chilly but sunny
[2025-05-12T06:45:50] Yamal: Well, that can be solved with good clothes and a few stops to get a hot drink. I'm returning to work today
[2025-05-12T06:49:22] Yamal: I've also left the region to live in the city with my family, so now I have to be extra careful with the police and the nami. I need to create the 25km/h profile! Now! However, I'll go to the countryside every three to four days to feed the chickens, and I also have to start the summer garden
[2025-05-12T06:49:43] Yamal: but I really miss that place xD
[2025-05-12T06:54:36] Noname: Country to city? Aww man. Show us this new place soon
[2025-05-12T06:58:14] Yamal: They are really close to each other, let's say that before I lived in the countryside in a town close to the city.

[2025-05-12T18:53:04] haku: but i applaud the seated effort!
[2025-05-12T18:54:02] haku: this is the gateway drug. once you ride electric and seated you will question why you stand up

[2025-05-12T21:29:28] Matthew: He be like this dude at a local pharmacy i was going to. Bro thinks hes going 80mph. Bro, change the values to mph. You're not going 80mph on a tricycle cruiser bicycle with a front wheel cheap hub motor.
[2025-05-12T21:31:23] Matthew: How do you guys plant that kind of power. 10kw rear wheel will throw me into a wheelie if I ain't careful

[2025-05-12T23:59:08] Yamal: But it's clear that if I dream of a future project, as of today, it's for the Ninebot, unless the laws force me to put aside the Namo to buy a certified e-scooter. But we'll see. The Ninebot project motivates me quite a bit, to be honest.
[2025-05-13T00:00:31] Yamal: And Trampa for Vedder! I'll always be there,

[2025-05-13T07:33:57] Yamal: There really is no need to race in the city, because in the end they will stop me, :( a motorcycle has already told me with its hand to slow down, it is dangerous but the accelerator encourages it, so let's find our appropriate moment, in the same way the city can have many dangers in terms of collisions and unforeseen events
[2025-05-13T07:37:47] Yamal: What I'm clear about is that I'm not going to walk around the city center with Nami, that's what the Ninebot is for... in the end it's always better to go unnoticed :D

[2025-05-14T13:54:49] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Why 200a battery for the 85250 is too much???
[2025-05-14T13:55:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Im running the 85150 at 100 battery and 180 motor in front
[2025-05-14T13:57:09] Yamal: Nop
[2025-05-14T13:57:19] Yamal: The name is really 250
[2025-05-14T13:57:22] Yamal: Means
[2025-05-14T13:57:30] Yamal: 250 A BATTERY
[2025-05-14T13:57:33] Yamal: But
[2025-05-14T13:57:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: With good cooling
[2025-05-14T13:57:44] Yamal: People say better use 200
[2025-05-14T13:57:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: On lower voltage probably
[2025-05-14T13:58:05] Yamal: Custom one
[2025-05-14T13:58:11] Yamal: 260A battery
[2025-05-14T13:58:13] Yamal: 22s
[2025-05-14T13:58:42] Dualtron Achilleus: Will see
[2025-05-14T13:58:52] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: As I said 200 battery for the 90h is enough
[2025-05-14T13:58:59] Dualtron Achilleus: Mine are only mofset changed not the one from rfp so
[2025-05-14T13:59:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But 250a phase it's not
[2025-05-14T13:59:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It wants at least 300-400a
[2025-05-14T13:59:23] Dualtron Achilleus: Guys with nucular did 500
[2025-05-14T13:59:27] Dualtron Achilleus: On your contry
[2025-05-14T13:59:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes they do run it 500a yes
[2025-05-14T14:00:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I don't think 85250 can do that tough
[2025-05-14T14:00:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Maybe rs500 ambrosini
[2025-05-14T14:00:16] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Can*
[2025-05-14T14:23:58] Dualtron Achilleus: I will see temps then go g300 if i can more
[2025-05-14T14:24:09] Dualtron Achilleus: Can 500A on peak
[2025-05-14T14:25:22] Yamal: 85/250 = 300A phase okee
[2025-05-14T14:25:27] Yamal: No problem
[2025-05-14T14:26:19] Yamal: I would like to see x12 and seven working at maximum power xD

[2025-05-14T14:29:09] Yamal: 💰💰💰
[2025-05-14T14:34:43] Dualtron Achilleus: What about 350
[2025-05-14T14:41:34] Yamal: Work but no safe
[2025-05-14T14:41:42] Yamal: 300 safe
[2025-05-14T14:42:21] Yamal: Don’t know with your new feet

[2025-05-14T14:48:42] Pandalgns: With the plate and everything I say
[2025-05-14T14:55:30] Dualtron Achilleus: I will try for science
[2025-05-14T15:01:47] Noname: Smaller than my 15a dc/dc lol

[2025-05-14T15:47:10] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Which happens to a lot
[2025-05-14T15:47:16] Yamal: Also can water cooling right
[2025-05-14T15:47:33] Yamal: Necessary for VESC controller …
[2025-05-14T15:47:41] Yamal: Alfombra heatsink
[2025-05-14T15:47:44] Yamal: “”
[2025-05-14T15:48:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: He bolted to board itself to the Xiaomi frame
[2025-05-14T15:48:48] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: With thermal paste off course
[2025-05-14T15:48:51] Yamal: Single or dual
[2025-05-14T15:52:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Single I think
[2025-05-14T15:53:38] Oreo huzky: Also smaller than g30 controller
[2025-05-14T15:53:38] Oreo huzky: <photos/photo_23258@14-05-2025_15-53-38.jpg>
[2025-05-14T15:53:58] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Sorry dual
[2025-05-14T16:00:39] Jason: hmm did some googling
[2025-05-14T16:00:59] Jason: did you connect footpad power and connected signal line to 2 adcs?
[2025-05-14T16:01:07] Jason: adc1 and 2
[2025-05-14T16:01:14] Ohad Avishay Shatz: Yes
[2025-05-14T16:02:39] Jason: <photos/photo_23259@14-05-2025_16-02-39.jpg>
[2025-05-14T16:03:16] Ohad Avishay Shatz: Yes like this scheme
[2025-05-14T16:03:32] Jason: check if 3v3 and gnd is really present on footpad
[2025-05-14T16:03:39] Jason: could be only gnd connected
[2025-05-14T16:03:51] Jason: or if it needs power 3v3 might be missing
[2025-05-14T16:08:06] Jason: hmm do not the shitsky
[2025-05-14T16:08:31] Ohad Avishay Shatz: Check where ?
[2025-05-14T16:24:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Look I do very short drives daily (3km max) so I can push a lot because not a lot of stress
[2025-05-14T16:24:58] Jason: mmm
[2025-05-14T16:25:02] Jason: only 3kw so might be fine
[2025-05-14T16:25:05] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: When I'll go long I'll try and tame myself and the beast
[2025-05-14T16:26:23] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: In the end of the day u can open 1000a and control your throttle response since most of the motor amps (especially peaks) are in the initial acceleration
[2025-05-14T16:45:53] Finn: Tested already. 170A phase with 90A Batt
[2025-05-14T16:50:35] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: We will soon have between 30 and 35 thousand kW again and you will try it.
[2025-05-14T16:59:30] Noname: I got to 130 how do you get 170?
[2025-05-14T16:59:35] Noname: 70a battery
[2025-05-14T17:00:02] Noname: Thought it was limited

[2025-05-14T17:00:30] Noname: What was your max watts?
[2025-05-14T17:01:10] Noname: Idk how lol. Think I should just get bigger controller.

[2025-05-15T02:10:20] haku: oh thats right
[2025-05-15T02:11:07] Noname: I just made a battery box. To fit 4 layers of 6x10 cut the plastic box out under the seat hammered a little on the corners and slid box in. Otherwise just rip all the wiring out no real modding.
[2025-05-15T02:11:27] haku: would the pannels still fit?
[2025-05-15T02:11:36] haku: plastic outer pannel
[2025-05-15T02:12:01] Noname: The shock was the worst but you could cut the top part and just make a U shape to bolt on top using the shock bolt
[2025-05-15T02:12:23] Noname: Yea nobody will know
[2025-05-15T02:12:47] haku: if you decide to get motor upgrades. is it possible on this frame?
[2025-05-15T02:12:48] Noname: I just took more apart than needed
[2025-05-15T02:13:09] Noname: Besides chain why not
[2025-05-15T02:13:48] haku: do you remember dropout opening in mm please?

[2025-05-15T02:16:51] Noname: 10" motor
[2025-05-15T02:17:50] haku: LY is a good option they make 65h 10 motor
[2025-05-15T02:18:02] haku: idk if crank can fit though
[2025-05-15T02:18:13] Noname: At 60a 130ph I hit 76c so not horrible bit that 70a hits different
[2025-05-15T02:18:15] haku: sprocket i mean

[2025-05-15T02:26:47] Noname: I just found this on AliExpress: $238.49 | 14 inch 36V-72V 1500W-3500W Electric Bicycle High Speed Motor with Tire 14x2.125/54-254 120km/h Hub Motor Brushless Scooter https://a.aliexpress.com/_mLKcPz9
[2025-05-15T02:27:03] Noname: Like this because bike says 14"
[2025-05-15T02:37:45] haku: thats 14. you have 12 tires yea?
[2025-05-15T02:38:05] haku: thats jetson bolt motor i think. the 14" version
[2025-05-15T02:39:40] Noname: Tire is 14" tall
[2025-05-15T02:40:31] Noname: It's a "bike" they measure Tire size not rim
[2025-05-15T02:42:18] Noname: 270 is 10.6" because they measure rim not where bead sits. It's all a bit confusing
[2025-05-15T02:42:56] haku: yes its 14 tall. isnt your tire 12 tall
[2025-05-15T02:43:23] Noname: MFer I wrote it in mm
[2025-05-15T02:44:06] Noname: 350mm ish
[2025-05-15T02:44:20] Noname: 14"
[2025-05-15T02:44:30] haku: im confused now. if 12" tall you need motor like jasons or LY. if 14 lots of options. even qs
[2025-05-15T02:44:45] haku: good
[2025-05-15T02:44:50] Noname: Tire is 14" rim is 10"
[2025-05-15T02:45:01] haku: oh i see
[2025-05-15T02:45:17] Noname: Show
[2025-05-15T02:45:35] haku: the one that jason has
[2025-05-15T02:46:04] Noname: For a bike motor you search 14in not 10. 10 to wide and no sprocket mount
[2025-05-15T02:47:08] haku: fuck they stopped selling lonnyo in ali
[2025-05-15T02:47:49] haku: fuck me
[2025-05-15T02:48:01] Noname: You can put 5kw+ to this one so get the bike first.
[2025-05-15T02:48:10] Noname: No
[2025-05-15T02:48:32] haku: no more lonnyo for america
[2025-05-15T02:48:44] haku: qs only only option now

I'm eagerly awaiting G2max in the distant future. I also hope to do a Vesc project with a dedicated Haku Rider seat in the future

[2025-05-15T07:43:09] Yamal: Quantum physics, at its core, is not just a theory about microscopic particles; it is a mirror that challenges our understanding of reality
[2025-05-15T07:44:12] Yamal: Thomas Edison had to make around 1,000 failed attempts before creating a working light bulb

[2025-05-15T18:09:32] haku: or doesnt count
[2025-05-15T18:12:02] Yamal: Thank you big brother
[2025-05-15T18:39:32] haku: not bad. america prolly charge 100
[2025-05-15T18:40:20] haku: battery makers here i asked get paid 120 hourly i asked in local scooter shop
[2025-05-15T18:41:17] haku: but thats straight up work. no rests.
[2025-05-15T20:12:20] Matthew: I've been digging seeing the ads on them
[2025-05-15T20:12:58] haku: yes theres a few in vegas
[2025-05-15T20:13:22] haku: recognize it right away with the X style light
[2025-05-15T20:13:58] Matthew: Im thinking quantum computing will help us discover how to harness power from stars and blackholes
[2025-05-15T20:15:20] haku: exactly. the future me traveled back in time and said peak g30 will be your legacy. it will a groundbreaking vehicle
[2025-05-15T20:15:34] Yamal: 80v lest run a little
[2025-05-15T20:16:09] haku: whats gps and rt data papi
[2025-05-15T20:16:16] Matthew: How do you get good to know you can build a good battery? Is there much demand for custom lithium battery packs in the usa?
[2025-05-15T20:16:48] haku: yes. people been asking me to make one tbh. im just afraid
[2025-05-15T20:17:47] Matthew: I was also kinda wondering how do you get licensed to ship your built batteries or do they get shipped under the hush hush here in usa?
[2025-05-15T20:17:49] haku: also i dont want to share my hoard of cells
[2025-05-15T20:17:58] haku: no idea tbh
[2025-05-15T20:17:58] Matthew: Lol
[2025-05-15T20:18:58] haku: i want that 50pl though even 60 to 100 pieces should be enough for projects
[2025-05-15T20:19:00] Matthew: Yeah, when I was looking up to buy and ship your insane laotie battery is it sounds like its tough to just randomly ship a battery not being a business.
[2025-05-15T20:19:35] haku: ill get a llc
[2025-05-15T20:19:39] haku: make it legit
[2025-05-15T20:19:40] haku: haha
[2025-05-15T20:19:57] Matthew: Someone that popped into our group asking about building a scooter with 6k budget said hes waiting for those cells to build his pack. He wants 150km/h
[2025-05-15T20:20:24] haku: lawd. thats nuts standing up
[2025-05-15T20:20:55] haku: big balls to the fellas that does it
[2025-05-15T20:21:15] haku: but not for me. only white smoke like new pope baby
[2025-05-15T20:21:45] Matthew: I think that's the best way. Had a buddy that flipped cars and he couldn't get dealership discount at the auctions until he got a dealership license and I mean it takes a civilian price of say $1k sale down to like $350 bucks... insanely different cost
[2025-05-15T20:23:04] Matthew: Told him he needs 30s and hes beyond my knowledge. I gave him background of me and just said some of the other questions needs to be put on main group to get answers he needs
[2025-05-15T20:23:38] haku: i dont even know what projects on that chat tbh. it all looks the same
[2025-05-15T20:24:15] Matthew: No burnouts here. But well rounded power with amazing low end torque has had me happy.
[2025-05-15T20:24:51] Matthew: Lol! I told him look at project builds because theres from basic to fuckin wild
[2025-05-15T20:24:54] haku: tire prices are up in ali. i have to consider that too..
[2025-05-15T20:25:37] haku: the ones that impress me is the custom cnc work. or carbon work. all designed by themselves
[2025-05-15T20:27:33] Matthew: I've been just buying things I see on a good price still. I just got a 90/70-6 touvot tire. Also got 80/65-6 tube and tire shipped was $14. If you roll through grants, nm I have a bunch of 100/65-6.5 and 90/65-6.5 tires.
[2025-05-15T20:28:11] Matthew: Will just give them to you in the name of haku industries and pope smoke... and swole projects lol
[2025-05-15T20:29:00] Matthew: The full v4 monorim front kit is $60 shipped on Amazon rn
[2025-05-15T20:30:14] haku: nice. im cool with stock for now
[2025-05-15T20:32:16] Unknown: how do i fix this error in vesc tool when uploading any script? variable_not_bound
[2025-05-15T20:32:21] Unknown: <photos/photo_23288@15-05-2025_20-32-21.jpg>
[2025-05-15T20:32:49] Matthew: Also that the last shipment i got from lonnyo is that i wasn't hit with any extra tariffs at the time and not sure if we will get hit by it. I have a spring coming from ali and no extra tariff.
[2025-05-15T20:34:51] haku: yes ali no tarrifs. prolly why lonnyo removed from ali for US
[2025-05-15T20:35:08] haku: very fucked situation
[2025-05-15T20:35:31] haku: oh well america needs to learn to wind these dam motors anyways
[2025-05-15T20:35:43] Rose: Hey there beh.​.​.​.​.​bz.​.​.​.​.​, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-05-15T20:37:09] haku: @jamessoderstrom needs to be american distributor for these motors
[2025-05-15T20:38:08] Matthew: Boooo
[2025-05-15T20:38:32] haku: peak g30 future builds require small scooter stators. cant be big

[2025-05-15T20:41:09] haku: ahahaha
[2025-05-15T20:41:09] Matthew: America needs people to work again lol. Elon musk makes his tesla vehicles with the most possible made in usa products as they can. And now getting rare earth agreements America citizens will learn we can make everything the world has been making and do it better and get more money for our economy. Voro motors has gone under the attack because they feel they dont need to adapt and admit they're just gonna rip us off. Good business practices, right?
[2025-05-15T20:41:28] Yamal: Just i come for give the food chicken
[2025-05-15T20:41:33] Yamal: The have a car

[2025-05-15T20:48:40] haku: american steel
[2025-05-15T20:49:35] haku: forged in the USA by free men
[2025-05-15T20:50:56] haku: Noname your steel better not be imported or ill be sad
[2025-05-15T20:52:30] haku: i will design my own vescs. american vescs with the help of the swedes @jamessoderstrom
[2025-05-15T20:52:47] Matthew: Swiss and German knifes... and Japanese. I have a Japanese gyuto knife that's made with Swiss stainless steel
[2025-05-15T20:53:08] haku: japan makes good kitchen knives
[2025-05-15T20:54:38] haku: can you imagine a pev thats pure american with custom goodyear tires. prolly 20k
[2025-05-15T20:55:11] Matthew: I need to ship my set off to Phoenix knifehouse. Every time I pick the knives up they cut you just touching the blade lol. One time I was food preparing got distracted and looked up while slicing food and chopped the tip of my finger off. Went through the nail and everything like a banana lol
[2025-05-15T20:56:07] Matthew: Lmao. We will be able to produce products with a good profit margin but its going to take a bit of time for this huge reset
[2025-05-15T20:58:22] Yamal: <video_file>
[2025-05-15T20:59:12] haku: future proofing right there
[2025-05-15T20:59:32] haku: do you need a boy chicken for them to lay eggs @jamaludin_algarnati

[2025-05-15T21:05:15] Matthew: My Thai friend loves them and chicken feet
[2025-05-15T21:05:25] Matthew: Intersting
[2025-05-15T21:05:26] haku: i dont like chicken feet.
[2025-05-15T21:05:32] Matthew: Me either
[2025-05-15T21:05:56] Matthew: I think ive tried chicken feet every way possible and they just ain't for me
[2025-05-15T21:06:18] Matthew: Kare kare is a favorite dish of mine
[2025-05-15T21:06:35] haku: the baby chicken or duck or dinasour is so tiny. its you dont feel chewing it. just the beak
[2025-05-15T21:07:25] Matthew: Hahaha. I think the beak would have my brain a bit twisted
[2025-05-15T21:08:52] haku: what about tequila worm. have you tried those?
[2025-05-15T21:09:14] haku: good stuff too
[2025-05-15T21:09:36] haku: its just a grub filled with tequila
[2025-05-15T21:11:00] Matthew: Lol. Nope, have not tried a tequila worm. I can't do tequila.... it was never my thing. Like Jose quervo gold, that never even made it to my stomach when id take a shot. I'd instantly throw up. Which is weird because im an alcoholic
[2025-05-15T21:11:13] Matthew: I have drank since Jan 10, 2021
[2025-05-15T21:11:22] Matthew: Haven't *
[2025-05-15T21:11:40] haku: yea i dont drink too. but when i was wilding out back i tried it
[2025-05-15T21:12:01] Matthew: Nice
[2025-05-15T21:12:39] Matthew: Yeah, I mean i could drink 1l of distilled spirits each day... tequila, 1 shot and it empties my stomach
[2025-05-15T21:13:14] Matthew: That and gin 🤢🤮
[2025-05-15T21:13:38] haku: i rather have vodka back then. because i needed to watch my weight
[2025-05-15T21:13:46] haku: beer too many calories
[2025-05-15T21:14:15] haku: vodka and diet coke 😭
[2025-05-15T21:14:30] Matthew: I stuck with vodka, captain and coke, cognac, and Kentucky bourbon. Them were my favorite. And nice red wine with steak
[2025-05-15T21:14:43] haku: whiskey shots
[2025-05-15T21:14:56] Matthew: Cognac and bourbon i drank neat
[2025-05-15T21:15:04] haku: im not a drinker but those are my preference back then
[2025-05-15T21:15:20] Matthew: Woodford Reserve 🤤
[2025-05-15T21:15:24] haku: also i only drink because of peer pressure
[2025-05-15T21:15:42] Matthew: Lol. I drank to hide the pain
[2025-05-15T21:16:03] haku: understandable. we all have our habbits
[2025-05-15T21:16:40] haku: for me it was prescription pain killers because of always injured. got hooked but got off
[2025-05-15T21:16:41] Matthew: Things that are extremely tough to work through in life has only got me a few times to where I was like I dont know how to cope without being drunk and that was tough
[2025-05-15T21:18:04] haku: nowadays coffee gets the job done. maybe once every 2 weeks ill take pervatin. you feel me dawgs
[2025-05-15T21:19:51] haku: i only take it when i need extreme focus and connecting to starlink. you feel me dawgs
[2025-05-15T21:20:21] Matthew: Them pills are something else. I was in a bad car wreck and until recreational cannabis started in az I was having procedures done all the time. Was getting spinal injections and nerve ablation. And also trigger point injections and pain pills just to function. Since recreational in mid summer of 2021 I haven't needed a single procedure done. So yes, I consume cannabis but it keeps my head straight and helps my pain. I hate how it can cloud my mind at times but its a small price to pay to stay good in life
[2025-05-15T21:21:00] haku: yea man. the opiods in US is a real thing
[2025-05-15T21:21:17] haku: i was abusing it maybe 2014
[2025-05-15T21:21:39] haku: i cant do cannabis. i get paranoid af
[2025-05-15T21:21:57] Matthew: Bad part for me was i would occasionally mess around with oxycodone while hanging with buddies doing BBQ on the beach then I got in a bad car accident and the pain pills were to just get out of bed. You are definitely familiar with injuries
[2025-05-15T21:22:17] Matthew: I was in my wreck easter Sunday 2012.
[2025-05-15T21:22:25] haku: dang
[2025-05-15T21:22:36] haku: yea. back then it wasnt as regulated as now
[2025-05-15T21:23:05] haku: doctors will give you 90 vicodines for a months supply. fuckin nuts
[2025-05-15T21:24:21] Matthew: I was on so many pills. I was taking 28 pills per day. I fuckin hated my life.... enters alcohol....
[2025-05-15T21:24:23] haku: what i miss is that old coco though. to expensive and laced with all kinds of sbit now
[2025-05-15T21:25:54] Matthew: I had the connects lol. I sold from 16yrs old til 19yrs old. Would have to tell new customers to not get carried away because it was practically pure. Some wouldn't listen and call saying they're having a heart attack. Just hang up on them lol
[2025-05-15T21:26:29] haku: haha
[2025-05-15T21:26:48] Matthew: Ever want to meet a good drug dealer... get sentenced to community service lol
[2025-05-15T21:27:05] haku: as a father now. i cant do that stuff anymore. need a straight head when with a child
[2025-05-15T21:27:26] Matthew: Glad to hear 🥰❤️
[2025-05-15T21:28:05] haku: but sometimes makes me wonder. what if i didnt get a child wich is a huge blessing to me. what if. would i still be a heathen
[2025-05-15T21:28:46] haku: being a dad changes people man
[2025-05-15T21:31:55] Matthew: So i had roommates off and on with my best friends. So I got to kinda help raise some boys. Roommates for years off and on. He got into the army to straighten his life out for the family. And I seen how innocent little children are and tried to be a good adult example. They had 4 boys the last time we lived together. They have 5 boys total now... and I love seeing how they've been the best parents they can be. 3rd boy in line just graduated.
[2025-05-15T21:32:44] haku: they grow fast. and learn fast. now i dont even want to vape around my boy
[2025-05-15T21:34:04] Matthew: Dude, they are sponges. They see and hear everything
[2025-05-15T21:37:32] haku: his first bike. if i only knew i wouldve kept it for myself. dual 70h 17x4s

[2025-05-15T23:28:01] Smart Repair: The front one will be next month. However, the suspension needs to be widened.
[2025-05-15T23:31:01] Yamal: I already had my session today! I didn't like being stopped and having to go straight ahead instead of stopping... but if they had stopped me, they would have probably taken my e-scooter to the impound lot and given me a fine.
[2025-05-15T23:39:47] Yamal: A battery you planing to use ,? Total.. from the two controller
[2025-05-16T00:00:17] Yamal: They try,,

[2025-05-16T01:05:19] skrtt: Are the suspensions correctly aligned?
[2025-05-16T01:05:55] skrtt: Back seems a bit lower

[2025-05-16T05:53:38] haku: yea. need to relearn or need more skill. but standing theres pros and cons. more cons tbh
[2025-05-16T05:53:59] Noname: Your tra la la gets good airflow
[2025-05-16T05:55:46] haku: first con. legs get tired. 2nd con on stoplight crossing random dudes stare on your ass. 3rd con when looking on left or right your arms follow so you kinda get off balance. 4th con wich is the most important cannot vape while riding more than 15mph. need 2 hands
[2025-05-16T05:57:08] Yamal: different vehicles

[2025-05-16T06:49:42] Yamal: I'm clear about one thing: the day I can push my scooter to its maximum speed? How much? 130/135/140 km/h. Maybe I can reach 30 kW? But my e-scooter is a 25 kW e-scooter, no matter what the peak watts say, and anyone who asks me will tell them the same thing. Nami = 25 kW real.

[2025-05-16T08:17:29] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: As you gain more speed, the w's go up.
[2025-05-16T08:54:19] Plohoi: Hello everyone so I had a short on my mksesc 75100 v2 desoldered 2 components and the short is gone and vesc works but I don't have 5v out anymore. Does anyone know what parts I can replace the shorted components with?
[2025-05-16T08:56:02] Plohoi: Or can I use an external dc dc?
[2025-05-16T09:02:35] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Well, after sending the 4 controllers to be repaired, none of them work, meaning it's better not to fix them since the installation is done correctly. I made a video so that no one tells me that you're doing that wrong. Where there is no proof of the crime, there is no crime. Therefore, these controllers are no good at all. They will be good when they work, but don't tell me that I'm doing things wrong because now I really don't know what to do. No one can help me. I've spent a lot of money on controllers, €1,700 in four 3-chul v4 previously I spent more money on tronic 250 I'm very tired
[2025-05-16T09:18:47] Pandalgns: Omg really?? None of the 4 work?? What a pain bro
[2025-05-16T09:22:53] Jason: group order : 30S4P 21700 Copper-Nickel composite plate unit price drops as more people 3+ =45$ per set 10+ = 40$ per set pure copper 0.3t, nickel on spot weld place fits 22.4mm spacing clown react if wanting to buy
[2025-05-16T09:23:04] Dualtron Achilleus: Crazy scooters here!
[2025-05-16T09:24:10] Jason: <photos/photo_23336@16-05-2025_09-24-10.jpg>
[2025-05-16T09:25:44] Dualtron Achilleus: Did tou race vs the nucular nami and oxo 90h?
[2025-05-16T09:43:44] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: if none of them work well, I've been trying to find a solution for 7 months, where I sent the controllers to be fixed, it's better not to ask. One day I told him one thing but his answer was "don't tell me what I have to do" that is to be a very very unprofessional person and to be a little arrogant then they say that in the scooter world there are bad people with people like that, it is to be expected that the repair of the 4 controllers I paid € 300 for a supposed partial repair because some of them do not work the BLE also I remember that once I asked him do you think you can have 2 repaired and working 100x100 his answer was "you are very demanding" that's why I say that it is better not to call or ask that person anything at all, when I do things wrong I recognize it but this time I did not do anything wrong I looked at all the cables before connecting the battery I made a video, so I do not know what to do, sell the scooter and forget about all this shit or give it to a friend
[2025-05-16T09:54:54] Pandalgns: Well, what a shame, consider a last option? Try cheaper controllers, since all the expensive ones are giving you bad results, for example with my MKS 84200 I am pushing 350A at 60V and soon I will put in the 72V, anyway I am waiting for them to fix the faults that the 100300 had that came out recently and they quickly took them off the market due to some problems they had but they told me that they would release them again with the faults fixed, I will surely buy them and they are much cheaper than the 3shull, the tronic and those brands and the truth is that I am delighted with them
[2025-05-16T09:56:13] S1m 0n: makerbase 84100 without cooling fins also very flat
[2025-05-16T09:56:13] S1m 0n: <photos/photo_23338@16-05-2025_09-56-13.jpg>
[2025-05-16T09:56:13] S1m 0n: <photos/photo_23339@16-05-2025_09-56-13.jpg>
[2025-05-16T09:59:43] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I have 22s, there aren't many controllers that can handle that voltage. If I put in others with less voltage, I'll have to make another battery.
[2025-05-16T10:03:49] Pandalgns: You can wait for the 100300 like I will, it supports up to 100v and 300 amps of discharge but you can push it much more, just like the 200 it is supposed to be up to 200a and I am pushing it to 350 and they barely get hot.
[2025-05-16T10:04:11] Pandalgns: Anyway, I'm going to try putting 22s into the 84200 and see what happens 😂
[2025-05-16T10:05:26] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 🤣🤣
[2025-05-16T10:06:00] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Don't make things up, because then what happens happens 🤣🤣
[2025-05-16T10:08:40] Pandalgns: I'm definitely going to buy the 100300, and I think the 84200s will handle a little more than 20s, but for the 120 euros each one costs, there's no problem if they break 😂😂
[2025-05-16T10:09:57] Pandalgns: But I need 20 more p45b cells 😂 to make 22s
[2025-05-16T10:11:54] Plohoi: Any ideas what it could be? I'm thinking it's the DC dc voltage regulator but not sure at all
[2025-05-16T11:00:14] S1m 0n: <photos/photo_23341@16-05-2025_11-00-14.jpg>
[2025-05-16T11:32:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Tbh no and the nuc NAMI is shit since it's stock motors without sensors he only open 250 per motor I think and I'm 300a rear
[2025-05-16T11:33:12] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And the 90h will leave me behind with the press of a throttle
[2025-05-16T11:34:10] Dualtron Achilleus: Iits not the big nuc right?
[2025-05-16T11:34:14] Dualtron Achilleus: Only 6f?
[2025-05-16T11:37:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's the biggest they have
[2025-05-16T11:38:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 24f
[2025-05-16T11:38:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And that is why it's a waste of money
[2025-05-16T11:38:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's like putting a dual 3chull on a stock thunder
[2025-05-16T11:45:33] Dualtron Achilleus: Oooh shit he has stock battery?
[2025-05-16T12:16:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No he 72/40 Molicel
[2025-05-16T12:17:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But still can do only 150 battery per nuc and have no need for 500 phase amps for fucking tiny 60h NAMI motor
[2025-05-16T12:18:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also for now he is not faster then Me his scooter is heavier and he himself is very "fat"
[2025-05-16T12:18:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm 60kg and 300a pahse the scooter is jumping when I pull throttle
[2025-05-16T13:02:28] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah motor too small
[2025-05-16T13:37:30] Pandalgns: The 100300??
[2025-05-16T13:37:53] Pandalgns: How big??
[2025-05-16T13:39:08] Pandalgns: The 84200 work perfectly, but when I spoke to the seller to buy the 100300, they told me that they had removed them from stock due to problems they had and that they are working on solving them to release them as soon as possible.
[2025-05-16T13:39:29] Yamal: What is 100/300?
[2025-05-16T13:39:38] Pandalgns: Mks 100300hp
[2025-05-16T13:39:44] Pandalgns: 100v 300a
[2025-05-16T13:40:19] Pandalgns: Compared to??
[2025-05-16T13:40:41] Pandalgns: So it will be a little bigger than the 84200hp
[2025-05-16T13:40:47] Pandalgns: But not so much
[2025-05-16T13:40:52] Pandalgns: 😂😂😂
[2025-05-16T13:41:48] Pandalgns: No problem, I have enough space to put 2 hehehe
[2025-05-16T13:53:42] Pandalgns: Really?? Wireless controller 😂😂😂
[2025-05-16T13:57:38] Pandalgns: And you say they come with an on/off switch? And does it work properly, or if you turn the engine off and move it a little, does it turn back on?
[2025-05-16T14:12:58] Pandalgns: But I imagine they can be asked for separately, right?
[2025-05-16T14:16:08] Pandalgns: What kind of connector does it use, anyway? What's it called? Because you can buy the same connectors separately and do it yourself...

[2025-05-16T20:39:43] Rose: Hey there ❤️, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-05-16T20:50:49] Yamal: Very sad
[2025-05-16T20:50:58] Yamal: Your nice project
[2025-05-16T20:51:12] Yamal: Can you repair the controller ?
[2025-05-16T20:56:17] Smart Repair: Yes... the step-down is really very fragile and, in my opinion, much too small. The device can only handle a maximum of 400mA at 5V for the entire controller.
[2025-05-16T20:57:38] Smart Repair: Parts have already been ordered and should be here in three days at the latest. I'll install another x12 tomorrow and ride it single for a few days. Luckily, I still have one x12 😅
[2025-05-16T21:00:44] Yamal: So in the end only one x12 get pain ?
[2025-05-16T21:02:01] Yamal: Do it powerfull controller 200/250 A battery //// 400/450?500??? A phase

[2025-05-16T21:12:34] Yamal: Very probably
[2025-05-16T21:14:05] Yamal: And if you had a front wheel without a motor it would be fucking crazy

[2025-05-16T21:17:07] Smart Repair: Roger 💥
[2025-05-16T21:17:51] Smart Repair: X12 have only 5V
[2025-05-16T21:26:34] haku: whoa. broken?
[2025-05-16T21:27:00] haku: american vesc no good?
[2025-05-16T21:30:01] 'lekrsu': Never seen a controller not have 12V.
[2025-05-16T21:30:39] Smart Repair: I'm 100% sure that the x12 only has 5V 0.4A for the entire controller operation. Therefore, I need to use an ADC module to supply the lighting with 12V.
[2025-05-16T21:31:34] Smart Repair: I'll look tomorrow, but I'm sure I only saw one coil and one step down.
[2025-05-16T21:32:18] 'lekrsu': 5v & 3.3v doesn't usually have coils, or any large ones, do they
[2025-05-16T21:34:11] 'lekrsu': As Ubox Lite, of course it has 12V, just not exposed to JST as it can't be kanged.
[2025-05-16T21:34:50] 'lekrsu': 5V & 3.3V is needed for general low powered peripherals to boot but to drain power, or as the worst I've seen phone charging from 5V, is nonsensical.
[2025-05-16T21:35:41] 'lekrsu': Yes, everything runs. 24V is otherwise the standard but that doesn't make sense for microcontrollers.
[2025-05-16T21:36:34] 'lekrsu': Dedicated lines to never do stepdown followed by stepup, eh.
[2025-05-16T21:36:50] 'lekrsu': NB doing stepdown to 5v and stepup to 5-36V on dash. Sus. Changed by resistor value.
[2025-05-16T21:37:25] Smart Repair: you're right... I found 12v
[2025-05-16T21:37:42] 'lekrsu': Thus, fucked drop on ADC with headlight. Range fucked.
[2025-05-16T21:37:58] 'lekrsu': Oh hell no 🙂‍↔️
[2025-05-16T21:38:10] 'lekrsu': That's @Un_Jason realm
[2025-05-16T21:38:13] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2025-05-16T21:39:06] 'lekrsu': They never do their own thing. Always offloaded. Thus G3 has weird things in it.
[2025-05-16T21:39:18] 'lekrsu': Hardware doesn't inherently make sense.
[2025-05-16T21:39:29] 'lekrsu': It's so.. large?
[2025-05-16T21:40:18] 'lekrsu': VCU instead of simple dash to run the screen, change regional limits. Then DRV not using JST, weird automotive connectors. XT90. Battery has literal empty cell slots.
[2025-05-16T21:40:45] 'lekrsu': European G3 has literal leds in deck that's turned off.
[2025-05-16T21:41:05] 'lekrsu': But you can ST-Link these already of course.
[2025-05-16T21:41:17] 'lekrsu': To activate the hardware that you bought.
[2025-05-16T21:41:27] 'lekrsu': To run the installed leds that would otherwise be off forever.
[2025-05-16T21:41:42] 'lekrsu': They actually have a gyro and light sensor now.
[2025-05-16T21:42:08] 'lekrsu': Auto headlights, steering power thing by gyro (?!), single motor traction control (still sucks).
[2025-05-16T21:43:21] 'lekrsu': Gyro affecting the driving
[2025-05-16T21:43:54] 'lekrsu': I don't know
[2025-05-16T21:44:00] 'lekrsu': Haven't had the opportunity to buy one
[2025-05-16T21:44:12] 'lekrsu': I'm not spending 12999 sek for the existing imports.
[2025-05-16T21:44:20] 'lekrsu': Right?!
[2025-05-16T21:44:26] 'lekrsu': Let me crash into a wall
[2025-05-16T21:45:12] 'lekrsu': I guess G3 also has autobraking
[2025-05-16T21:45:49] 'lekrsu': I can't use that, how else will I check my phone when cruising? Cruise control? Hell no.
[2025-05-16T21:46:46] 'lekrsu': I hate the idea of it
[2025-05-16T21:46:52] 'lekrsu': and the experience using it
[2025-05-16T21:47:50] Yamal: Benjamin Vedder , this is for you

[2025-05-16T21:55:09] 'lekrsu': $1000?

[2025-05-16T21:55:25] 'lekrsu': I'll keep bench pressing my G2

[2025-05-17T19:48:22] Rose: Hey there MostG30, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-05-17T20:02:21] Noname: I forgot who bought the Seven controller here?
[2025-05-17T20:02:43] Noname: I was wondering where in USA it shipped from
[2025-05-17T20:03:34] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/yQ8D0qKU2mA?si=yRs16zfOhg8Er9O1
[2025-05-17T20:11:52] Noname: @Oreohuzky Did you buy the Seven?
[2025-05-17T20:12:49] haku: thats actually pretty cool
[2025-05-17T20:13:46] haku: you want one eh? you want more power eh?
[2025-05-17T20:15:25] Noname: Need more for the c80 and if I'm gonna spend 200 on that why not take controller from the moped and get a seven for it
[2025-05-17T20:16:06] Noname: Got another 50a unused battery on the moped and all of the phase amps
[2025-05-17T20:16:58] Oreo huzky: Yes i did
[2025-05-17T20:17:11] Noname: So 250a battery and like 700 phase would be cool
[2025-05-17T20:17:47] haku: thats what im talking about!
[2025-05-17T20:18:22] Noname: 90a phase for the c80 isn't enough
[2025-05-17T20:18:30] haku: the old mini 100/100 will be donated? maybe or perhaps to me?
[2025-05-17T20:19:04] haku: told you
[2025-05-17T20:19:16] haku: how many times must i be right

[2025-05-17T20:20:11] Noname: I set 130
[2025-05-17T20:20:19] Noname: Battery 60
[2025-05-17T20:20:54] Noname: I had battery around 70a and got 130phase but I forgot bms is 60a. Set it to 10min overcurrent protect lol
[2025-05-17T20:30:08] haku: beautiful! trottinette
[2025-05-17T20:30:29] haku: fully custom 1 of a kind
[2025-05-17T20:31:22] 'lekrsu': If speeds is correct then yeah. Set tire to correct size.
[2025-05-17T20:41:46] Rose: Hey there נהוראי, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-05-17T20:49:02] Noname: Ok I bought an 85/240. See how the Lil c80 goes with that
[2025-05-17T20:51:20] haku: what about seven? you are the only one in the US that can do it
[2025-05-17T20:51:38] haku: you be the test bed

[2025-05-17T20:58:10] Noname: Sold.out
[2025-05-17T20:58:37] Noname: And I'm far enough in debt anyway so whatever
[2025-05-17T20:58:59] Medhi Cantin: Thank you sir 🦾
[2025-05-17T21:02:46] Giorgio: When I set a speed limit like 25 km/h, the bike stabilizes at 25, but it vibrates if I keep everything accelerated, how can I solve it?
[2025-05-17T21:11:18] haku: sold out? really who buys it then
[2025-05-17T21:33:07] Rose: Hey there 🛴💨, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-05-17T21:53:44] Pandalgns: Guys, if while riding the scooter a motor burns out or there is a short circuit in the phases, the scooter turns off and won't let you turn it on for protection?
[2025-05-17T22:03:54] haku: california is fucked. we are next. no wonder surron boys be hiding. https://youtu.be/tkIBQ6m7wPo?si=mV8M5SkadGnJaujm
[2025-05-17T22:04:50] haku: thats why you cali boys need peak g30v2. future of mobility. stealth is key
[2025-05-17T22:05:04] 'lekrsu': The same thing happens on my system, seems to be default behavior. Very aggressive speed control.
[2025-05-17T22:05:18] Pandalgns: The secondary vesc connected by CAN if it turns on
[2025-05-17T22:05:53] Pandalgns: I understand that the reason it doesn't turn on is because it detects a short in the motor and protects
[2025-05-17T22:06:01] haku: but i have to say these surron kids are reckless. really fucks the pev scene
[2025-05-17T22:17:24] Noname: I've seen 1 person in our group rides that wasn't a complete dick on a surron
[2025-05-17T22:21:38] haku: surron seems overated now. imo
[2025-05-17T22:22:10] haku: maybe ultra bee or varg. you can register and be a dick
[2025-05-17T22:23:20] haku: look at this. https://youtu.be/6ewtCZ-z010?si=4v1QYitO5jaNe_-E
[2025-05-17T22:23:59] haku: looks like a vegas cart kart track too
[2025-05-17T22:26:33] Noname: Idk what it is but no interest. Mabey the complete silence or the weird body posture to maneuver
[2025-05-17T22:28:35] haku: electric unicycle. the gayest of gays. imo. the bent over stance just is not for me
[2025-05-17T22:29:23] Noname: Range and portability
[2025-05-17T22:29:30] haku: i dont judge. everything electric i like
[2025-05-17T22:29:49] Noname: Otherwise gay af

[2025-05-17T22:30:06] haku: to bad you cant do burnouts on electric uni
[2025-05-17T22:30:20] Yamal: But people using they are in a dream
[2025-05-17T22:30:25] Yamal: They very happy
[2025-05-17T22:30:32] Yamal: For me don’t like too
[2025-05-17T22:30:36] haku: i want 0 carbon emissions you feel me dawg..

[2025-05-17T22:30:49] haku: white smoke you feel me dawg
[2025-05-17T22:31:07] Noname: Kinda you can bonk a curb and chirp the tire. Or freespin
[2025-05-17T22:31:38] Noname: It's a neat device but going fast is nerve-wracking
[2025-05-17T22:31:46] Yamal: Let's see if now with the good weather the big e-scooters in the city are becoming more popular.
[2025-05-17T22:31:48] haku: yea agreed
[2025-05-17T22:32:02] haku: i want to try tbh
[2025-05-17T22:32:44] Noname: Learning is torture on your legs

[2025-05-17T22:38:20] Yamal: Moto !!
[2025-05-17T22:59:13] Noname: Ah fuck I need money
[2025-05-17T23:00:25] haku: why you like this frame
[2025-05-17T23:00:37] Noname: 10" rim
[2025-05-17T23:00:40] Pandalgns: But what the hell, these things in Spain would sell you for 1000 or 2000 euros 😂😂 In your countries it's a given 😂😂
[2025-05-17T23:00:46] haku: i see
[2025-05-17T23:00:51] Noname: No they're expensive
[2025-05-17T23:00:57] Noname: This doesn't run currently
[2025-05-17T23:01:00] haku: is it
[2025-05-17T23:01:16] haku: get the honda ruckus
[2025-05-17T23:01:28] haku: theres a electric version ive seen
[2025-05-17T23:01:50] haku: ive seen no one modded those yet.
[2025-05-17T23:01:56] haku: you will be worlds first
[2025-05-17T23:04:24] Noname: Money 💰 is a problem
[2025-05-17T23:04:47] haku: if i had unlimited budget i would too.
[2025-05-17T23:05:09] haku: it has pedals.haha
[2025-05-17T23:05:39] haku: prolly as big as your c80
[2025-05-17T23:07:36] Noname: Mabey if it's there next week I offer 300 lol. I'm gonna need to work some overtime.
[2025-05-17T23:07:59] Noname: Also it's a 250 mile ride
[2025-05-17T23:34:43] haku: worth it if you really want
[2025-05-17T23:35:21] haku: i would drive to LA for those wildcat minibmx. its cheaper there
[2025-05-17T23:46:46] Matthew: Anus exposed
[2025-05-17T23:49:28] Rose: Hey there Kathy Salazar, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-05-17T23:52:22] Matthew: In Phoenix where I was living the area was perfect for high power modified euc. Bunch of off-road trails. Hole in rock. Bunch of canal trails. Different hills and hiking areas to where you can move along safely like a bicycle since the tire is so tall. So much offroad trails. I took my dual motor y11+ out on some of the trails and theres just no way to travel them. Where as the euc just hops around and makes there way wherever. But I hear that the learning curve isn't very favorable on euc
[2025-05-17T23:52:56] Matthew: I was near Scottsdale Greenbelt too
[2025-05-17T23:53:05] haku: looks like alot of legwork and core stregnth
[2025-05-17T23:55:55] Matthew: I think that's why I want to. Im not very active and dont have a bed partner lol... so I need some kinda cardio in my life and some muscle back too. I used to lift 400lbs like nothing with my welding jobs. Then I become spoiled and weak lol
[2025-05-17T23:55:58] Noname: Just a tank of fuel. Need to save for my trip
[2025-05-17T23:56:02] Noname: Unfortunately
[2025-05-17T23:56:41] Matthew: <photos/photo_23369@17-05-2025_23-56-41.jpg>
[2025-05-17T23:56:58] Noname: There's a free c80 in Cali if I can find it again and it's still there lol
[2025-05-17T23:58:32] Matthew: Some of the areas I loved riding around. Scottsdale greenbelt. Papago park. Paradise valley... all a blast to ride around and many many nice restaurants and street food trucks around... and elote man on their golf carts serving up fresh corn cob and drinks and so on...
[2025-05-17T23:58:54] Matthew: Yeah, I miss whats available out there... but really liking my new small town life
[2025-05-17T23:59:46] Noname: That's 30mi from my friends house lol. I could never live there
[2025-05-18T00:02:56] Noname: @Bradhaku San diego to far?
[2025-05-18T00:03:11] Noname: Still had it 18w ago
[2025-05-18T00:04:58] Matthew: I hated the people there in the end. When I first moved out to Phoenix in 2015 things seemed fine. Then no offense, all the California residents were fleeing the state and californicating arizona and new mexico and Texas. Things were different till the started fleeing. Now everyone there is so fuckin selfish and self entitled pieces of shit. Every single day someone feels you should be out. Even just walking down the sidewalk. So I fony miss any of that state but the food and choices of entertainment... otherwise that state is now trash.
[2025-05-18T00:16:58] haku: yea. thats far. but i go sometimes.
[2025-05-18T00:19:12] haku: theres a part of phoenix i like. queen creek. farmland
[2025-05-18T00:19:30] haku: i dont know how they grow crops there tbh

[2025-05-18T02:46:34] Noname: Asking because if I build this stuff all day it wouldn't be fun as a hobby
[2025-05-18T02:47:06] haku: well some people do what they love and get paid
[2025-05-18T02:47:31] haku: speaking as a bum ofcourse
[2025-05-18T02:48:03] haku: my only hope in making it out of the hood is peak g30v2 sales
[2025-05-18T02:48:25] Noname: Yeah spent all week wiring shit and didn't touch the c80
[2025-05-18T02:49:42] haku: wiring for work?

Stand yourself man and throw that scooter in the trash.

[2025-05-18T17:59:13] Face de Pin Sucé: No they didn't, they just won one day Jordi was fifth at Le Mans And he won yesterday only because Kilian has Ambrosini shit rims that failed in his last race
[2025-05-18T18:00:13] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: You only go to places to talk bad, they told you to help but you don't know how to do anything other than talk shit every time you talk 🤣🤣🤣

[2025-05-18T18:01:44] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes RFP had a crash in practices, and everyone here were nice with him and cared because it was extreme at 130kmh end of the straight line he lost front wheel, crashed on his head and had a trauma Only shit guys like frenchhtrott are laughing at it
[2025-05-18T18:03:07] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: They are just racing incidents, I fell at more than 180 when I was racing motorcycles ☺️
[2025-05-18T18:03:35] Face de Pin Sucé: And for us, well, we won the Light category with Arianna Malo finishes P4 with an injury at his foot and back from last week (huge high side, we thought he wouldn't drive this one) and Matis finishes P3 for his first race of the year We are happy of the week-end People are shitting on social medias but were not there to see what happens

[2025-05-18T19:39:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is it copyright blocked ?

[2025-05-19T22:24:09] Yamal: Free cowboy
[2025-05-19T22:24:38] haku: this is also prevalent in the olympics
[2025-05-19T22:26:18] haku: the only question is will you be remembered for your victories or will you be remembered as a cheater.
[2025-05-19T22:26:32] haku: i say the first choice
[2025-05-19T22:30:29] haku: when you decide to compete @jamaludin_algarnati i will be your conditioning coach. ill have you on all kinds of stuff
[2025-05-19T22:32:42] Yamal: I'm more of a pigs and diamonds snatch type

[2025-05-19T23:18:45] skrtt: No but im wondering if i buy then or make battery
[2025-05-19T23:18:50] skrtt: Price is the same
[2025-05-19T23:21:30] Yamal: That's the path most of us have followed, little by little
[2025-05-19T23:22:07] Yamal: The end you buy 70 or 75h?
[2025-05-19T23:24:29] skrtt: I didnt buy them lol
[2025-05-19T23:24:55] skrtt: But i think there are 75h with the same opening as 70h
[2025-05-19T23:25:09] skrtt: So if i find them i will buy the 75h
[2025-05-19T23:25:23] skrtt: Money is not free 😭

[2025-05-19T23:32:04] haku: future peak g30v3 needs those motors.
[2025-05-19T23:33:16] skrtt: 33x2 is speed?
[2025-05-19T23:33:21] skrtt: Or torque?
[2025-05-19T23:33:21] haku: Noname will weld a box worthy of 20s4p 50pl. isnt that right noname?
[2025-05-19T23:33:55] haku: speed
[2025-05-19T23:34:23] skrtt: Whats the max amps they can take?
[2025-05-19T23:34:26] haku: but anything can be torque if you add enough amps
[2025-05-19T23:34:35] skrtt: Hmmmmm
[2025-05-19T23:34:42] haku: your ride will just be heavier. imo

[2025-05-19T23:37:27] skrtt: I need someone that i can pay to help me decide what to do
[2025-05-19T23:37:31] skrtt: 🥲
[2025-05-19T23:37:54] haku: just ask questions and build
[2025-05-19T23:38:16] haku: experiment. blow 3 12 fets and you are almost pro
[2025-05-19T23:38:50] haku: burn your hand then you will earn more skill and knolwledge
[2025-05-19T23:38:55] haku: experience is key
[2025-05-19T23:39:09] skrtt: True indeed
[2025-05-19T23:39:28] skrtt: Im just wondering if vesc is a good daily
[2025-05-19T23:39:42] skrtt: Cuz i need the scooter to take me to places everyday
[2025-05-19T23:40:00] haku: it works well for me. but i dont use it as a commuter
[2025-05-19T23:40:11] skrtt: I will use it to commute

[2025-05-19T23:41:12] haku: in my opinion. just my opinion. everything has to pair and match.
[2025-05-19T23:41:19] haku: motor esc and battery
[2025-05-19T23:41:51] haku: my jetson bolt overheats because shit motor. it has good battery and vesc

[2025-05-19T23:43:37] haku: speed motor
[2025-05-19T23:43:43] haku: or balance
[2025-05-19T23:43:56] skrtt: I see
[2025-05-19T23:44:04] skrtt: Maybe balanced then
[2025-05-19T23:44:18] skrtt: I dont need to go 100+
[2025-05-19T23:44:38] haku: im talking out of my ass. dont listen to

[2025-05-19T23:47:42] haku: i have a subscription for cheap china tires. they send me new pair everymonth
[2025-05-19T23:48:34] haku: cheaper than netflix
[2025-05-20T00:05:06] Noname: Perfectly fine controller. I have probably thousands of miles on mine. Just keep it in sane power levels
[2025-05-20T00:10:22] haku: vesc really good for scoots
[2025-05-20T00:10:28] haku: very tiny
[2025-05-20T00:10:37] haku: and peak g30v2
[2025-05-20T00:10:52] haku: lots of power on small package
[2025-05-20T00:20:40] skrtt: Whats a sane power?
[2025-05-20T00:20:52] skrtt: Battery and phase?

[2025-05-20T00:21:57] skrtt: Not sure if u are
[2025-05-20T00:33:09] Noname: Pushing 15kw on a 300lb emoped with 85/250 I'm probably taking my chances with that one. My vsett 11 is 12kw with two 85/250.
[2025-05-20T00:35:28] skrtt: I see
[2025-05-20T00:36:09] Jason: using it as daily driver and perfectly fine

[2025-05-20T03:01:00] haku: i dont trust it. needs more if taking abuse. g30 is a deck maybe the stem part might snap

[2025-05-20T03:24:40] Noname: I can only imagine the ammount of stuff in warehouses in this world
[2025-05-20T06:23:30] Yamal: Haku, you decorated your profile picture! I really don't understand your struggle many times, and you begin to doubt what you stand for and what you support ^^’
[2025-05-20T06:24:01] haku: its not me. its Noname
[2025-05-20T06:24:37] haku: trans is counter culture now boy! america became too masculine
[2025-05-20T06:25:05] Yamal: Then you also like to defend children a lot,
[2025-05-20T06:25:18] Yamal: Right
[2025-05-20T06:25:31] haku: yes
[2025-05-20T06:25:45] haku: no trans until adult okay
[2025-05-20T06:26:12] Yamal: Very young people are in this chat, Which children exactly do you like to protect?
[2025-05-20T06:26:23] haku: the innocent
[2025-05-20T06:36:59] Yamal: Well
[2025-05-20T06:37:50] Yamal: Sometimes your reactions or attitude shocks me a little, brother! And I say things with a smile.
[2025-05-20T06:38:46] Yamal: How many times have I heard you talk about education in the schools in your neighborhood and the shit they're shoving down children's throats?
[2025-05-20T06:40:03] Yamal: And then I find these things, it's an incongruity, don't you think?
[2025-05-20T06:40:30] Yamal: Or is it me who wakes up in a bad mood?
[2025-05-20T06:40:33] Yamal: XD
[2025-05-20T07:01:05] haku: i must say yamal. a photo is worth a thousand words. you feel me dawg
[2025-05-20T07:02:41] haku: i must make peace with the they/them. i should offer them a token of peace or maybe kiss the ring of peace perhaps.
[2025-05-20T07:02:42] haku: <photos/photo_23424@20-05-2025_07-02-42.jpg>
[2025-05-20T07:04:46] haku: we should all live in this world. we need to live together in harmony. people are dying in other countries yamal. blood is shed everyday and i am here complaining of rainbows. think the dying children yamal. getting bombed
[2025-05-20T07:05:41] haku: let me sleep this over. maybe when i wake up tommorow ill be back to my senses
[2025-05-20T07:05:46] Yamal: What I had to tell you, I've already told you, so don't complain about the things that happen. I'm just saying that if you want good for yourself and your family, want it for the people in this group. Because being very good at home and setting a good example only to then spill the beans elsewhere isn't part of my project. And of course, there's no sincerity in that action! And if there's no sincerity, then there's nothing.
[2025-05-20T07:06:12] haku: agreed
[2025-05-20T07:06:29] haku: good thing my son doesnt read this. haha
[2025-05-20T07:08:26] Yamal: You want for others what you want for yourself and your way of fighting in my opinion is incorrect
[2025-05-20T07:08:28] Yamal: ^^
[2025-05-20T07:09:47] Yamal: And we're not going to talk about war because otherwise we're going to have a conflict xD

[2025-05-21T19:51:57] Rose: Hey there Ilies, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-05-21T19:53:02] haku: imo @SibClimb its the correct move to have fast girl on your team. as a matter of fact replace all drivers with women and you will get more fans. just my opinion
[2025-05-21T19:55:19] haku: speaking as a fan of the sport. women light and nimble.strong hips are meant to carve corners and best of all superior on the bent over stance. well balanced because of weight distribution. its science
[2025-05-21T19:57:32] Matthew: Does anyone have a favorite 12v stepdown converter they use and a link to purchase?

[2025-05-21T21:12:40] Lisa: Selling used Sharkset front suspension for Ninebot G30 - €75 Note: The tire has a hole and needs to be replaced. This is a used Sharkset front suspension for the Ninebot G30. It works perfectly and noticeably improves ride comfort. Additionally, both sides are equipped with 3D-printed mudguards that significantly enhance splash protection - see photos.

[2025-05-21T22:13:05] haku: far fars
[2025-05-21T22:33:16] Unknown: yeah ofc because for accel you need to increase kinetic energy quickly
[2025-05-21T22:36:52] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: That's right, the more energy the more acceleration it's like a combustion engine with more gasoline...⛽️

[2025-05-21T22:56:59] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I have videos made before applying voltage so you can see that I did nothing wrong, but the controller does not work when I install it.
[2025-05-21T22:58:57] Dualtron Achilleus: did something blow
[2025-05-21T23:02:16] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: In my installation nothing, not even a short circuit or anything, I closed my garage door, turned off the TV, the music, everything, I never heard anything, the only thing I saw was that the controllers don't work 🤷‍♀️

[2025-05-21T23:10:27] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: When you go to a place to eat but they don't serve me well, you don't come back, right? Well, the same thing happened to me, whether I fixed the controller or not.
[2025-05-21T23:11:00] haku: im not really familiar with the eu scooter scene. there should be places you can get it fixed
[2025-05-21T23:11:07] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Open up, I'm not saying no, but I don't know you 🤷‍♀️☺️

[2025-05-21T23:32:47] Yamal: Is okay
[2025-05-21T23:33:28] Yamal: If you feel more the mini bmx is okay
[2025-05-21T23:34:43] Yamal: In the end, we drive the vehicles we like the most
[2025-05-21T23:34:54] haku: i can get wepoor running today. it will be jank. i need to design stuff. that part of my creativity is not yet explored. you feel me dawgs
[2025-05-21T23:36:06] haku: and where can i even ride that thing if highways are illegal

[2025-05-22T12:07:34] ausias: they say it has "500w" motors xD
[2025-05-22T12:07:44] 'lekrsu': Overmodulation causing stuttering even at a mere 10%. FOC params are not adjusted after detection. Everything else working flawlessly. Stutters are felt and an annoyance. What's the solution here, as others do have it working, thus I am asking. Not dependent on the FOC observer.
[2025-05-22T12:07:47] Max Rainlogix: Kph not mph
[2025-05-22T12:08:14] Max Rainlogix: And has over 250w is illegal too

[2025-05-22T19:48:24] Yamal: I don't know, the translator
[2025-05-22T19:51:45] Yamal: Good back in Mintierra means being able to carry a good load, call it emotional or work or physical, the misinterpretations of course all come from you, in my circle of friends all the men are real men with all the letters and women are women, each one knows their place and there is no doubt about it, men only joke about women in a loving and mischievous way, because we love women! and we never joke about gays or trans!! We teach by example to the little ones who come before us
[2025-05-22T19:51:53] Yamal: <sticker>

[2025-05-22T20:35:06] haku: nah. not my style my boy. im i live a humble lifestyle

[2025-05-22T20:36:55] haku: fancy stuff attract the wrong crowd. just my opinion. plus i cant afford it
[2025-05-22T20:38:05] Yamal: Okeeey 👍
[2025-05-22T20:38:12] Yamal: Sorry ^^’
[2025-05-22T20:42:34] Rose: Hey there Co, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-05-22T20:53:47] Matthew: 🤘
[2025-05-22T20:57:41] Yamal: <photos/photo_23486@22-05-2025_20-57-41.jpg>
[2025-05-22T21:02:06] Matthew: Im gay and I completely do not understand pride month. Straight pride! Human pride. White pride. Black pride. There will never be equality if that's what humans feel we need in life. I like seeing how they say will be first black woman in office. How's about just saying first woman to take presidential office. That's all I see necessary.
[2025-05-22T21:03:54] Matthew: Buddy sold his red acura nsx because it drew too much attention
[2025-05-22T21:04:39] haku: dang. thats a garage collection though. price of that vehicle will just increase
[2025-05-22T21:04:55] haku: but true. it does attract attention
[2025-05-22T21:05:35] haku: like the mk4 supras.
[2025-05-22T21:16:33] Matthew: Well, he had 2 of them. He put corvette rims on it before he sold it. I wish I could remember the brand rims that were on it. Something like $15k for the 4 rims alone. Had a rear carbon diffuser too. I never got to ride in it.... I rode in his other nsx. But he said that diffuser makes it to where acceleration at 120mph was just as good as 60mph. He said highway racing people he was surprised with the results.
[2025-05-22T21:22:11] Matthew: Dude has been in the car industry for like almost as long as I been alive. He just sold his shop last year in Miami. Was named Garage Yourself. He had a dyno dynamics 450 in there as well if people wanted him to tune their motors or he offered remote tuning as well. Honda is his niche specialty... stock f22c he was putting down 276whp n/a. He made custom exhaust and intake and did a Hondata k-pro conversion to accomplish that tune. His '95 civic si was restored from the ground up, he said he had around $55k invested in that car and it had a b18c type-r jdm motor swap and running 5psi t3/t4 setup and around 340whp.
[2025-05-22T21:23:21] Matthew: So his silver nsx he kept and drove for a while and sold it for a profit. I have no idea how low of price he had them 2 different nsx cause he wouldn't tell me.
[2025-05-22T21:23:51] Matthew: https://youtu.be/ZCCe7RYt6B4?si=kSOZ7EFo4uJEDppL
[2025-05-22T21:24:07] Matthew: Got the JEEEEBUZ g-meter haha
[2025-05-22T21:27:30] Pandalgns: Guys, does anyone have a copper strip link to make a high-discharge battery? It would be for a 20s10p with a 450A discharge Molicel P45B, but I can't find anything clear on AliExpress.
[2025-05-22T21:29:04] ausias: ?
[2025-05-22T21:31:05] Matthew: How do you implement overmodulation?

[2025-05-22T22:26:58] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: This is the one I put in, the battery has never heated up, if the soldering iron is on, then with 0.2 you can put it on

[2025-05-22T22:40:52] 'lekrsu': I can't believe the G30 with Monorim was that stable (most unstable thing I've ridden)
[2025-05-22T22:41:55] Unknown: another level of fun...
[2025-05-22T22:42:27] Unknown: i get scared when i look at the display and it says A something or more

[2025-05-22T22:47:41] Unknown: Jag vet inte om man eventuellt ska skära upp deck uppifrån, sätta en spacer på den till ett rejält paket och en singelmonterad motor bak med något förlängt spacer. Skulle vara fränt att trycka ut 8-10kw ur en sådan och enbart satsa på acceleration. Minin är stabil till 70≈ med den nuvarande dämpningen. Har närmre 8000km på denna så 50+ med en hand är bekvämt. Aldrig vurpat. Kommer fortsätta på Engelska nu, för alla andras skull 👌🏽
[2025-05-22T22:48:33] Unknown: you all Swedish thats wild
[2025-05-22T22:49:04] Unknown: yeah A0 ist 100 A5 is 105 B0 is 110 and so on
[2025-05-22T22:49:40] 'lekrsu': Topping out at 75 km/h here, honestly the reaction time or unexpected road debris is more of an issue.
[2025-05-22T22:50:30] 'lekrsu': And it's still the stock suspension, I hope G3 is compatible, where are the parts?!
[2025-05-22T22:51:18] 'lekrsu': Du kan också bli :)
[2025-05-22T22:52:09] Unknown: what hahaha 😂

[2025-05-22T23:51:45] Unknown: That sounds right! Damn

[2025-05-23T00:09:26] haku: indeed. why even question it?
[2025-05-23T00:10:18] haku: for some reason i get this accent when i ride standing up. never happens sitting down.
[2025-05-23T00:11:21] 'lekrsu': flash it @jamaludin_algarnati you too
[2025-05-23T00:11:48] haku: i feel like if a man sexaully assaulted me standing up. i cant defend and might actually like it
[2025-05-23T00:12:35] 'lekrsu': You're already a victim of the throttle delay
[2025-05-23T00:15:04] Pandalgns: You leave your anus exposed, allowing for the possibility of being assaulted abruptly by an erect man.
[2025-05-23T00:15:07] Pandalgns: 😂😂😂😂
[2025-05-23T00:16:33] haku: theres 2 choices. let go of the handlebar. deffend the assault and crash. or just take it in while riding. 2nd option will still get you to your destination
[2025-05-23T00:18:18] Pandalgns: The second option will clear up all your doubts 😂
[2025-05-23T00:20:04] haku: i choose 2nd option for standing stance too. but if seated. it will not happen. anus is protected. plus you can dodge em. science and facts right there
[2025-05-23T00:21:22] Pandalgns: Like a gazelle in a world full of lions 😂😂 dodging dangers
[2025-05-23T00:21:47] haku: never know man! las vegas is a jungle
[2025-05-23T00:21:56] Pandalgns: 😂😂😂
[2025-05-23T00:22:12] Pandalgns: You live on the edge
[2025-05-23T00:55:09] Max Rainlogix: Does anyone sell this kind of throttle?
[2025-05-23T01:19:27] skrtt: Polish throttle eheheh. U want the link for the website?
[2025-05-23T01:21:11] Max Rainlogix: Yea, does it have way to ship into Russia?
[2025-05-23T01:25:45] Noname: You have to message them first last time I tried.

[2025-05-23T13:25:06] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Hope they don't die for no reason like #3shull
[2025-05-23T13:36:38] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: let's wait 🤣
[2025-05-23T13:41:11] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Does anyone have the chops to repair it? If he fixes 2, I'll give him the other two. Just try to help me. I'll give him that gift. Is that better than spending €1 on gas? What would you do? 🤣🤣🤣
[2025-05-23T14:20:28] skrtt: Probabily bigger suspension and spacers
[2025-05-23T14:21:02] skrtt: U bought this ones
[2025-05-23T14:26:57] skrtt: U have a link?

[2025-05-23T16:02:03] ausias: +34 695 34 50 11
[2025-05-23T16:03:45] skrtt: Its rober products
[2025-05-23T16:27:49] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But rfp also selles it no?
[2025-05-23T16:27:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And ambrosini also
[2025-05-23T16:29:28] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Sorry only ambrosini

[2025-05-23T16:35:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: As the g300?
[2025-05-23T16:35:45] skrtt: Yes
[2025-05-23T16:35:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Then why sell both ?
[2025-05-23T16:36:06] skrtt: Marketing 🤪
[2025-05-23T16:36:12] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No I don't think so
[2025-05-23T16:36:29] ausias: yup
[2025-05-23T16:36:30] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So Robers isn't the same ?
[2025-05-23T16:36:45] skrtt: Robers is the same as g300
[2025-05-23T16:36:47] ausias: it has to be
[2025-05-23T16:36:49] skrtt: He told me
[2025-05-23T16:37:22] skrtt: Also makerx told that ambrosini rs500 is the same as stock
[2025-05-23T16:37:30] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So why don't people buy from makerx ?
[2025-05-23T16:37:58] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I think they upgrade the MOSFETs because those are not racing capable
[2025-05-23T16:38:18] skrtt: <photos/photo_23510@23-05-2025_16-38-18.jpg>

[2025-05-23T16:42:01] Dualtron Achilleus: I can ask fastride they use then how much phase amps they push
[2025-05-23T16:47:23] Pandalgns: Ambrosini does this with everything, Lonnyo motors with their logo, Go FOC controllers with their logo and all with the inflated price, marketing
[2025-05-23T16:48:57] ausias: 🫣
[2025-05-23T16:51:12] skrtt: Phoebe motors
[2025-05-23T16:51:17] skrtt: Lonnyo does the same
[2025-05-23T16:58:59] Max Rainlogix: With traction control of course?
[2025-05-23T17:03:23] Jason: I guess they just don't have any knowledge
[2025-05-23T17:03:30] Jason: also the metr display with their logo
[2025-05-23T17:03:35] Jason: lmfao
[2025-05-23T17:10:21] ausias: you got link??

[2025-05-23T17:58:45] Noname: Needed aluminum because of heated grips
[2025-05-23T18:17:18] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: The best is the DOMINÓ brand
[2025-05-23T18:26:26] Yamal: Comrades, we're back to the beginning! Today at noon, my rear controller caught fire. It was a bit strange, I was going slow the whole time because there was a lot of traffic. At about 35/40 km/h, I heard shots like a machine gun, and suddenly a burst of flame appeared below me on the right side. We're back on the Segway G2. Sorry! Also, not having a discharge BMS doesn't help with high current surges, and there's no way to stop the fire, just a river. xD Regards
[2025-05-23T18:32:22] 'lekrsu': Use fuses?
[2025-05-23T18:37:41] Yamal: Nop
[2025-05-23T18:38:39] 'lekrsu': Use fuses.
[2025-05-23T18:54:36] Hackintoshhhh: My condolences. Ur scaring me.
[2025-05-23T18:57:37] Patrick: How can you do this good pictures always they Look amazing
[2025-05-23T19:08:07] skrtt: I hope theres nothing major :/
[2025-05-23T19:08:46] skrtt: Maybe it overheated cuz of constantly start and stop
[2025-05-23T19:09:16] Max Rainlogix: Hope to you quick returning to the roads
[2025-05-23T19:13:09] Dualtron Achilleus: Dude everyone burn his vesc
[2025-05-23T19:15:00] 'lekrsu': <photos/photo_23512@23-05-2025_19-15-00.jpg>
[2025-05-23T19:16:42] haku: i will one up them. have my spintends stamped haku industries. made in the USA
[2025-05-23T19:19:09] haku: so close but yet so far. almost
[2025-05-23T19:20:34] haku: remember the saying it takes 5 destroyed vescs to graduate vesc university
[2025-05-23T19:22:43] haku: @jamaludin_algarnati open vesc. if powerstage easy replacement
[2025-05-23T19:24:42] haku: also dont listen to the fardriver demons.
[2025-05-23T19:31:14] Yamal: Sorry :(
[2025-05-23T19:31:22] 'lekrsu': Considering there wasn't a BMS or a fuse, it's all burnt to crisp.
[2025-05-23T19:31:32] Yamal: <voice_message>
[2025-05-23T19:33:58] haku: oh man! crazy. sorry to hear my boy
[2025-05-23T19:34:20] haku: atleast only 1 controller
[2025-05-23T19:39:56] Oreo huzky: Don’t mind me cleaning my vesc
[2025-05-23T19:40:25] haku: we dont mind at all
[2025-05-23T19:40:42] haku: as a matter of fact take a shower with it
[2025-05-23T19:41:27] Oreo huzky: As you wish
[2025-05-23T19:42:14] Plohoi: Aha after 5 min out of the box
[2025-05-23T19:42:55] Oreo huzky: <video_file>
[2025-05-23T19:43:05] haku: tbh we pushing it to the limits of its reccomended specs
[2025-05-23T19:43:28] Dualtron Achilleus: they were durty?
[2025-05-23T19:43:56] Dualtron Achilleus: sure it not help
[2025-05-23T19:44:39] haku: but thats what the term "balls to walls" mean.
[2025-05-23T19:44:47] Oreo huzky: Very durty
[2025-05-23T19:45:32] Dualtron Achilleus: mince with 16 s 90Bat arrent stressed xd
[2025-05-23T19:47:32] haku: honestly. lets just say we are still blessed because controllers are cheaper than motors. if you fry a ly motor that would cost twice. economics and facts right there
[2025-05-23T19:48:15] haku: but if you burn your battery. that is the end
[2025-05-23T19:48:38] haku: because theres no stopping that. this is why bypass is no good
[2025-05-23T19:51:24] Dualtron Achilleus: does ant bms block if it decharge more then written?
[2025-05-23T19:52:01] Dualtron Achilleus: like 400A bms block if there is a short cuc in esc
[2025-05-23T19:52:14] haku: yes
[2025-05-23T19:52:56] 'lekrsu': Yes, ocp lvl1, 2 and short.
[2025-05-23T19:53:02] 'lekrsu': Different time levels.
[2025-05-23T19:53:07] 'lekrsu': As per configuration.
[2025-05-23T19:53:34] Dualtron Achilleus: OKay that good
[2025-05-23T19:53:42] Dualtron Achilleus: yamal no bms?
[2025-05-23T19:53:45] 'lekrsu': Short is next to zero time. Nothing should ever burn. But JBD is better, can't love Ant after Haku's incident.
[2025-05-23T19:53:50] 'lekrsu': No bms.
[2025-05-23T19:54:09] Dualtron Achilleus: how it work for charging if no bms?
[2025-05-23T19:54:29] 'lekrsu': Charge-only circuit with balancing exists. But you have to use fuses for discharge then.
[2025-05-23T19:54:41] Dualtron Achilleus: what is JBD
[2025-05-23T19:54:48] 'lekrsu': Another bms manufacturer
[2025-05-23T19:55:37] haku: yea. i like jbd more tbh
[2025-05-23T19:56:59] Dualtron Achilleus: what haku incident
[2025-05-23T19:57:07] haku: but ive never had high discharge jbds though
[2025-05-23T19:57:34] haku: just remember me for my accomplishments not faliures okay
[2025-05-23T19:59:45] Dualtron Achilleus: ant bms doesn't protect?
[2025-05-23T20:00:16] haku: lets just say that the bms said that day. "the hand that smites me down will be cut down" okay
[2025-05-23T20:00:17] haku: <photos/photo_23514@23-05-2025_20-00-17.jpg>
[2025-05-23T20:00:17] haku: <photos/photo_23515@23-05-2025_20-00-17.jpg>
[2025-05-23T20:00:49] haku: i turned off discharge on bms but it still had current
[2025-05-23T20:00:51] Dualtron Achilleus: dude hard
[2025-05-23T20:01:00] Dualtron Achilleus: now wearing glowes
[2025-05-23T20:01:35] haku: thats how you learn. as i say pain is the best teacher
[2025-05-23T20:02:00] Noname: Reminds me of a youtube channel. "3 burnt fingers" idk what that meant before you did this.
[2025-05-23T20:02:55] haku: remember guys. the next day i taped up and still finished battery

[2025-05-23T20:30:53] haku: engineering mindset
[2025-05-23T20:34:13] Noname: I would frame these or mabey an acrylic display case

[2025-05-23T21:07:27] haku: fusion is for the rich fucks
[2025-05-23T21:31:16] skrtt: The condensator can get water inside no?
[2025-05-23T21:40:57] haku: my son.he was 2 years old here. born to ride. i think its time for an upgrade. maybe mini pitbike.

[2025-05-23T23:23:14] Matthew: 20s4p give a bunch of amps?
[2025-05-23T23:59:49] haku: depends on the cells sure
[2025-05-24T00:00:13] haku: 50pl is big dick right now
[2025-05-24T00:02:25] haku: imo these cells are best for us light electric users. so much power fit in small space. emotos and evs dont really need this unless racing. they can fot more cells in parrallel

[2025-05-24T10:14:26] Yamal: I have a BMS just for charging the 40A "Ant" scooter. The truth is, I've always used the free-discharge option since I was using the stock Nami, with no apparent problems! But now I'm clear that I want to install a full BMS, so to speak, for more safety.

[2025-05-26T06:59:31] Noname: Only 2 hours of debauchery cad drawing 😆
[2025-05-26T07:00:46] haku: im jelly because instead of watching cad tutorials i fell asleep

[2025-05-26T07:21:48] Noname: Because it's more comfortable than a concrete shop floor for 8hrs
[2025-05-26T07:22:07] haku: true
[2025-05-26T07:24:10] Noname: Damn I gotta add a brush the gunk on nozzle pisses me off
[2025-05-26T07:28:20] haku: i dont even bother with that
[2025-05-26T07:38:18] Noname: The goo collects on the tip
[2025-05-26T07:39:16] haku: use .6 nozzle it makes it faster

[2025-05-26T07:39:49] haku: but for battery holder .4 still better
[2025-05-26T07:39:49] Noname: Someone used a wire brush and made a holder I'm gonna do that
[2025-05-26T07:40:07] Noname: .6 is chunky ain't it
[2025-05-26T07:40:24] haku: yea. but who cares about layer lines
[2025-05-26T07:42:45] Noname: I'm making a finished piece not a batt holder

[2025-05-26T08:32:31] Arnau Martinez Casals: Now at rear has a 70h from a friend but i have a old 75 on mi nami to put on the dt3 when the 90h arrives for nami
[2025-05-26T08:33:07] Yamal: Why not same engines
[2025-05-26T08:33:15] Yamal: Dual 80h Or 90h?
[2025-05-26T08:33:28] Arnau Martinez Casals: 80 front 90 rear
[2025-05-26T08:34:26] Arnau Martinez Casals: With same Amps bigger motor have more torque
[2025-05-26T08:34:27] Yamal: The 80h engines are simply impressive.
[2025-05-26T08:35:48] Arnau Martinez Casals: Yes i see your nami finished now
[2025-05-26T08:36:29] Arnau Martinez Casals: Last time i see it 🥲
[2025-05-26T08:36:56] Yamal: Powerful/torque/top speed/and with 600A they practically don't heat up
[2025-05-26T08:36:58] Arnau Martinez Casals: Just waiting for brakes stuff and the 90h
[2025-05-26T08:37:10] Yamal: Wouh 🤩🙇
[2025-05-26T08:37:26] Yamal: Power project

[2025-05-26T09:03:00] Hackintoshhhh: Can u ask her if they will release bom and gerber files?
[2025-05-26T09:04:27] Yamal: How your power scooter going

[2025-05-26T09:05:42] Hackintoshhhh: Good very good
[2025-05-26T09:07:13] Yamal: The Nami lowered like this looks impressive! But for everyday use without suspension, I don't think it's the best idea. Of course, yours is going on the track.
[2025-05-26T09:09:57] Arnau Martinez Casals: Thats why i have the dt3, nami is for race, Or a friday saturday take a right, but not for daily, I live barcelona center is a police magnet the nami

[2025-05-26T09:31:21] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: When I took mine apart, I had it painted like this. There's a big difference between painting with a spray gun and powder coating.
[2025-05-26T09:31:48] Arnau Martinez Casals: Probably
[2025-05-26T09:32:57] Arnau Martinez Casals: Its three-layer paint
[2025-05-26T09:33:27] Arnau Martinez Casals: Mitsubishi original color 😂
[2025-05-26T09:33:35] Arnau Martinez Casals: Car paint
[2025-05-26T09:35:16] haku: powdercoat is the way imo
[2025-05-26T09:35:26] haku: just expensive
[2025-05-26T09:35:54] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, but the best for my taste
[2025-05-26T09:36:38] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: but there are not as many colors as with a spray gun

[2025-05-26T11:46:29] Jason: weped sucks
[2025-05-26T11:46:41] Jason: ruining scooters image in here
[2025-05-26T11:46:44] Yamal: Y000
[2025-05-26T11:46:46] Yamal: Why
[2025-05-26T11:46:49] Jason: funk weped

[2025-05-26T11:47:47] Yamal: REALLY !!
[2025-05-26T11:47:51] Yamal: ^^’
[2025-05-26T11:49:14] Jason: they went very fast on public road bragging about how it's fast and uploaded that shit on yt, and public news is now talking shit about entire electric scooter more because of it
[2025-05-26T11:49:34] Patrick: There 100V 250A uses kinda old fets though iirc
[2025-05-26T11:49:59] Jason: rentals fucking up the view and then weped
[2025-05-26T11:50:00] Jason: lmao
[2025-05-26T11:50:07] Jason: I hate this country
[2025-05-26T11:50:29] Hackintoshhhh: True. Individual parts can be upgraded though. The layout is good and well protected. All that counts for me personally
[2025-05-26T11:50:50] Patrick: Yea but old esc meanwhile
[2025-05-26T11:50:52] Jason: also it's good baseline for designing new vesc
[2025-05-26T11:51:33] Jason: what i struggle most is dcdc tho 😢
[2025-05-26T11:51:51] Patrick: Why
[2025-05-26T11:51:58] Jason: finding the right chip is hard
[2025-05-26T11:52:14] Patrick: For 32s right
[2025-05-26T11:52:18] Jason: yes
[2025-05-26T11:52:23] Jason: and 40s
[2025-05-26T11:52:26] Jason: and so on
[2025-05-26T11:52:31] Patrick: Ah you have dcdc on pcb?
[2025-05-26T11:52:34] Jason: yep
[2025-05-26T11:52:46] Jason: I wanna properly implement power button
[2025-05-26T11:53:04] Jason: so odometer and other datas get saved correctly
[2025-05-26T11:53:04] Patrick: I have a open 12V dcdc from mp2 i can send you pictures later they are for higher voltage
[2025-05-26T11:53:18] Patrick: Atleast 30s works with those
[2025-05-26T11:53:23] Jason: I have those isolated dcdcs
[2025-05-26T11:53:30] Jason: like 3 of those, destroyed in some ways
[2025-05-26T11:53:51] Arnau Martinez Casals: 65h speed? Sensorless!?
[2025-05-26T11:54:12] Jason: me and both gigaesc author also found same chip, and he actually built it and it was too big caz of the transformer
[2025-05-26T11:54:44] Jason: I think can make custom one from Chinese transformer manufacturer but haven't looked far into that
[2025-05-26T11:56:06] Jason: dual 33x2
[2025-05-26T11:59:54] Arnau Martinez Casals: Yes but 65h?
[2025-05-26T11:59:58] Arnau Martinez Casals: Sensorless?
[2025-05-26T12:24:58] Yamal: Sad ..
[2025-05-26T12:26:20] Jason: maybe
[2025-05-26T12:26:21] Jason: idk
[2025-05-26T12:42:23] Hackintoshhhh: Yea
[2025-05-26T13:06:16] Yamal: Vesc
[2025-05-26T13:06:23] Yamal: Vesc scooter

[2025-05-26T14:22:37] Yamal: Hawaii / Mumbai
[2025-05-26T14:46:00] Smart Repair: Is there anyone here who can take a look at my settings and fix them if necessary?! X12 + 70H and permanent ABS overcurrent. And the motor heats up extremely quickly.

[2025-05-26T15:01:53] Yamal: Using both controller again ?
[2025-05-26T15:03:40] Smart Repair: no, only single for now
[2025-05-26T15:04:20] Yamal: The times I got "over current" the solution was to increase the absolute maximum amps to have more margin
[2025-05-26T15:04:36] Smart Repair: I sawed my finger two weeks ago, so the conversion will have to wait a few more days.
[2025-05-26T15:05:07] Smart Repair: <photos/photo_23551@26-05-2025_15-05-07.jpg>
[2025-05-26T15:05:35] Smart Repair: I have already gone up and down very far...
[2025-05-26T15:06:27] Smart Repair: As soon as I accelerate a little too quickly, ABS comes immediately
[2025-05-26T15:06:43] Yamal: I remember you said you were going to fix the x12s! Good recovery! I also hit my toe a few weeks ago, but it's better now, waiting for the nail to fall off. xD
[2025-05-26T15:07:06] Yamal: Abs 500 xD
[2025-05-26T15:08:01] Yamal: 82°C motor ?
[2025-05-26T15:08:17] Smart Repair: I've repaired the two broken x12s and they're sitting next to me. Toothache sounds bad too 😖 Get well soon.
[2025-05-26T15:08:36] Smart Repair: after a few hundred meters
[2025-05-26T15:09:01] Yamal: No a lot for single right
[2025-05-26T15:09:54] Yamal: I have reached almost 70 in dual, the maximum I remember.
[2025-05-26T15:10:40] Yamal: <photos/photo_23552@26-05-2025_15-10-40.jpg>
[2025-05-26T15:11:46] Yamal: So x12 ready man ???
[2025-05-26T15:12:19] Smart Repair: Even in dual mode, the 70h got warm very quickly. Now I've even added Ferro, and there's no improvement. the worst thing is abs... driving normally is not possible
[2025-05-26T15:12:45] Smart Repair: After 30km
[2025-05-26T15:12:57] Yamal: Wich observer you have,,
[2025-05-26T15:14:06] Smart Repair: Yes.... They live again 😃
[2025-05-26T15:14:12] Smart Repair: Ortega original
[2025-05-26T15:14:59] Patrick: I thought x12 is a very good vesc?
[2025-05-26T15:15:28] Smart Repair: That's my guess too. Unfortunately, it's beyond my ability.
[2025-05-26T15:16:17] Patrick: Connect spintend and get values maybe?
[2025-05-26T15:17:07] Smart Repair: 26s = Ubox 💥
[2025-05-26T15:17:22] Patrick: Ah yes big kaboom
[2025-05-26T15:18:04] Patrick: Idk can mp2 get good values? I mean this one works up to 30s maybe you can get a used one
[2025-05-26T15:18:10] Smart Repair: same 70H + 85250
[2025-05-26T15:18:41] Smart Repair: This makes the engine feel worse
[2025-05-26T15:19:00] Patrick: Isnt the voltage kinda important too? I kinda remember getting worse results when doing detection at empty battery
[2025-05-26T15:19:26] Patrick: Atleast motor made worse sounds when driving with full battery and caused more overcurrents
[2025-05-26T15:20:47] Smart Repair: I'll test it again with the 250 settings
[2025-05-26T15:26:57] Yamal: Willy wonky?
[2025-05-26T15:54:30] Smart Repair: With the ubox settings, there's currently no cutoff, but the temperature isn't normal, and that's with a max 250A phase.
[2025-05-26T15:55:18] Smart Repair: 3x gas and I can boil water 🤯
[2025-05-26T16:00:27] Hackintoshhhh: MP2 gets perfecr values
[2025-05-26T16:00:37] Hackintoshhhh: No tweaking needed
[2025-05-26T16:00:53] Hackintoshhhh: Where as ubox needs some minor optimising
[2025-05-26T16:10:05] Jason: hmm i guess those detection desults are kinda weird
[2025-05-26T16:10:19] Jason: i guess I'll keep using low side current shunt
[2025-05-26T16:12:08] David: Does anyone know how to fix IT idk what to do with IT IT shows this error everytime i want to upload
[2025-05-26T16:18:17] Yamal: But beautiful power, nonetheless, right? Imagine when you're on a 400A dual-phase...
[2025-05-26T16:18:49] Yamal: 13kw single 250phase…..
[2025-05-26T16:20:01] Yamal: Beautiful to watch how the powerful vesc work
[2025-05-26T16:25:02] Smart Repair: My plan was actually to use 2x 450A phases 😃 The front end will then spin. Maybe lead in the steering rod 🤔
[2025-05-26T16:48:41] Smart Repair: Ah, okay, I didn't do that. I'll test it later. Thanks 🙏
[2025-05-26T16:50:37] Smart Repair: That was with 20s. Now 450A with 26s will definitely be fun 🥰
[2025-05-26T16:58:53] Smart Repair: Right?
[2025-05-26T17:09:07] Noname: Version 2.hoe much better

[2025-05-26T18:05:18] Smart Repair: Single without Field weakening 😀 dual with FW goes crazy
[2025-05-26T18:17:40] Sascha: Has anyone tried SVD (Simple Vesc Display) ? I've transferred it to the ESP/display using Arduino, but I'm not seeing any data from the vesc.
[2025-05-26T18:18:29] NetworkDir: try reversing rx-tx and make sure the gnd connected vesc

[2025-05-26T21:01:22] Smart Repair: I'd be interested in a comparison... A few seconds of "full throttle" +60°C. That's only 280A phase... That seems extremely high to me 🤔
[2025-05-26T21:01:56] haku: back in the day furries use to be cool..https://youtu.be/xat1GVnl8-k?si=QOln8Qr8nhKMuLxR

[2025-05-26T21:57:46] Yamal: For me, a good project would be the G2 Max. Also, if I'm forced to buy a Dualtron in 2027, it would be a big Dualtron for legal reasons.
[2025-05-26T21:58:15] Yamal: Unless another frame comes out that motivates me more because of the date
[2025-05-26T21:58:32] Yamal: Gt3 don’t know man…………

[2025-05-27T00:09:51] Noname: Just be careful. It has built in fracture points with the threads. Those are way stronger than the home depot threaded rod though. But idk about jumping in them
[2025-05-27T00:10:34] haku: i see. ill try. lets see what breaks first my body or my bike/scooter
[2025-05-27T00:10:35] Noname: And the nut you used doesn't help it's a weak point

[2025-05-27T00:34:10] Matthew: Glad to know. The 100/100 is in the mail and gonna be installed this week. Is there anything I should look out for? I have some experience with the 85150 and 85250...
[2025-05-27T00:41:59] 'lekrsu': Default phase limit is 135A, 180 absolute, and there's no ST-linking or 12V ports.
[2025-05-27T01:10:24] Mr_BitcoiNn: Guys I finaly managed to make my Max g30 with the 75200 work smooth Only thing I need to Fix is the start. It can only work if I push it to like 7 Kmh. After that speed I can press the throttle. Where should I touch to have a better launch?
[2025-05-27T01:11:42] Mr_BitcoiNn: At 30 kmh If Press full throttle Thr scooter will lift by itself It is crazy. Today I almos do a back flip. I wasn't reddy for that power 🫣
[2025-05-27T06:23:41] Yamal: 7230 working on it ?
[2025-05-27T06:44:28] Medhi Cantin: Yes
[2025-05-27T06:46:36] Yamal: How is the championship going with him?
[2025-05-27T07:34:40] Yamal: ^^ 🌅
[2025-05-27T07:37:37] Medhi Cantin: Hard 😅
[2025-05-27T07:40:10] Yamal: high level,,, and increasingly more sophisticated and powerful e-scooters
[2025-05-27T08:39:37] Yamal: <video_file>
[2025-05-27T09:27:39] Medhi Cantin: Technology has evolved, but we'll see if it's better with vesc if it sucks I'll plug my Kellys back in
[2025-05-27T09:29:33] Yamal: Wich vesc do you think mount
[2025-05-27T09:32:43] Medhi Cantin: For the moment, I'm using flipsky v2s. And if I like it, I'll take a g300 or a shull
[2025-05-27T09:36:48] Yamal: Foc forever
[2025-05-27T09:38:39] Dualtron Achilleus: You will do nothing with kelly at race, stay on vesc
[2025-05-27T09:39:01] Medhi Cantin: Let's see what happens with traction control
[2025-05-27T09:40:16] Medhi Cantin: Then I will gain 3 kg my Kelly weight for 1 is about 1kg even +. I'm down to 57 kg
[2025-05-27T09:41:17] Medhi Cantin: Battery in 5/6 parallel max what's wrong with sending 15 minutes at full throttle
[2025-05-27T09:42:50] Dualtron Achilleus: Max is 60kg?
[2025-05-27T09:43:09] Dualtron Achilleus: What is your current batteri
[2025-05-27T09:43:18] Medhi Cantin: 65kg
[2025-05-27T09:44:14] Medhi Cantin: 20s9p I can discharge 900 amperes over 10 seconds 650 for 1 minute And the rest no limit P45b
[2025-05-27T09:44:28] Medhi Cantin: I'm going to make another one in 22s
[2025-05-27T09:47:18] Dualtron Achilleus: 900A with 9p with 45b is not really recommanded haha
[2025-05-27T09:47:39] Dualtron Achilleus: Voltage will be to much
[2025-05-27T09:47:53] Dualtron Achilleus: But anyway you not pushing this so its ok
[2025-05-27T09:47:57] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah go 22s!
[2025-05-27T09:47:59] Medhi Cantin: Datasheet p45 b 80 amp max harsh discharge not recommended
[2025-05-27T09:48:34] Dualtron Achilleus: Go with new tabless cells
[2025-05-27T09:48:46] Medhi Cantin: Yes Max for the moment 500 by the
[2025-05-27T09:48:47] Dualtron Achilleus: The voltage drop is lower than p45b
[2025-05-27T09:49:15] Medhi Cantin: Send me a link to the cells
[2025-05-27T09:49:42] Medhi Cantin: Yes, I have a -8V slag 😅
[2025-05-27T09:49:53] Medhi Cantin: Safe

[2025-05-27T09:52:33] Dualtron Achilleus: At 60a discharge these cell V drop is lower that 0,2V per P
[2025-05-27T09:52:39] Dualtron Achilleus: Than 45b
[2025-05-27T09:52:59] Medhi Cantin: Yes, it's interesting

[2025-05-27T09:55:17] Medhi Cantin: It works great and it's reliable except there's too much power, it slips and you can't control the trott
[2025-05-27T09:56:23] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah you cant turn with kelly thab the main issu
[2025-05-27T09:57:23] Medhi Cantin: Yeap
[2025-05-27T10:07:24] Yamal: We need more VESC handle 22s/23/24s

[2025-05-27T11:32:09] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/cqXLb5Qnfug?si=iRAl9IiO2KophAsP
[2025-05-27T12:23:34] Smart Repair: The 100/100 has 12v. Only the Lite version doesn't.
[2025-05-27T12:25:32] 'lekrsu': The 100/100 is named Alu Lite, though? It has 12V internally, of course, but no designated stronger 12V output compared to 85150 and the rest.
[2025-05-27T12:26:46] 'lekrsu': <photos/photo_23571@27-05-2025_12-26-46.jpg>
[2025-05-27T12:28:15] Smart Repair: That's true, although both are made of aluminum 😅
[2025-05-27T12:40:50] 'lekrsu': Merely the power stage ^^
[2025-05-27T12:49:38] Dualtron Achilleus: 250A continous
[2025-05-27T12:49:48] Dualtron Achilleus: And 400burst
[2025-05-27T12:50:14] Dualtron Achilleus: <photos/photo_23572@27-05-2025_12-50-14.jpg>
[2025-05-27T12:55:28] Yamal: Str500 no more for sale
[2025-05-27T12:55:46] Dualtron Achilleus: Shit
[2025-05-27T12:55:54] Dualtron Achilleus: You know why
[2025-05-27T12:59:14] Yamal: Don’t know
[2025-05-27T12:59:21] Yamal: Vedder know

[2025-05-27T15:32:00] Rose: Hey there Rocky, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-05-27T16:02:33] Rose: Hey there ❤️, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-05-27T16:31:29] D: Hey. My VESC arrived today. Spintend Ubox 100V 100A. What is the USB-C Port for?
[2025-05-27T16:33:21] 'lekrsu': It's for Vesc Tool via PC.
[2025-05-27T16:33:35] D: Oh so to Connect it by cable?
[2025-05-27T16:33:55] 'lekrsu': Yeah, if you don't have the bluetooth dongle
[2025-05-27T16:33:59] D: Or Can I just power it with USB-C cable and use Bluetooth module?
[2025-05-27T16:34:09] D: Because I don’t have a USB C Port on my Pc
[2025-05-27T16:34:10] D: Hahahhaha
[2025-05-27T16:34:14] 'lekrsu': No, you need a battery or power supply to power it, won't boot from usb c.
[2025-05-27T16:34:27] 'lekrsu': USB A to C can connect as well of course, lol.
[2025-05-27T16:35:47] D: Ohhhh
[2025-05-27T16:35:49] D: xD
[2025-05-27T16:35:57] D: I forgot hahahhah
[2025-05-27T16:36:32] D: Uhm if I Connect my VESC to my battery I can’t turn it Off via App Right? Only with the Button thingy
[2025-05-27T16:36:50] 'lekrsu': Button needs to be pressed for it to boot at all.
[2025-05-27T16:37:11] D: Oh is the Button a requirement? Because I don’t really know where to put it
[2025-05-27T16:37:18] 'lekrsu': Yes, it's a requirement.
[2025-05-27T16:37:56] 'lekrsu': It's a 16mm hole needed if you're wondering.
[2025-05-27T16:38:18] 'lekrsu': Otherwise, the sketchy way is to install the button inside and turn on/off with bms discharge, ))
[2025-05-27T16:42:58] D: Ohhh okay
[2025-05-27T16:43:09] D: Yeah I think Button would be better hahhahaha
[2025-05-27T16:43:35] D: Uhm I Need Like a tutorial or something on how to Connect all the cables? Is there any 😂?
[2025-05-27T16:43:49] D: I have Xiaomi Pro 2 Dash
[2025-05-27T16:44:01] D: And maybe for Backlight too
[2025-05-27T17:09:46] D: Can I just put my rear light at the „CAN“ port where 5V and GND is?
[2025-05-27T17:10:07] D: I think that should work or Not?
[2025-05-27T17:38:48] Rose: Hey there Kyle, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-05-27T18:14:12] D: Or is „CAN“ only for something specific?

[2025-05-27T18:41:20] Patrick: Can can be used to connect like everything that works over can
[2025-05-27T18:41:29] Patrick: Vesc express runs over can as example
[2025-05-27T18:53:59] haku: yamal no need to summon rose

[2025-05-27T20:09:22] haku: speaking as a representative and ambassador of the american scooter riders of america. we demand that we see more of fast girl
[2025-05-27T20:09:41] Yamal: Maybe you could start a league little by little in your area! That would be wonderful.

[2025-05-27T20:17:52] Patrick: 5V
[2025-05-27T20:17:54] Matthew: Do those have same dimensions as pmt tires?
[2025-05-27T20:18:10] Patrick: Works for most xiaomi & g30 rear lights
[2025-05-27T20:18:16] D: At Can?
[2025-05-27T20:18:32] Patrick: Or use the servo connector there was a Code for pwm for rear light for this somewhere
[2025-05-27T20:18:41] 'lekrsu': But verify if there's a resistor in line or not. Some rear have, some don't. You need it.
[2025-05-27T20:19:06] 'lekrsu': Really, without an esp?
[2025-05-27T20:19:24] Patrick: I just heard it never saw it
[2025-05-27T20:19:30] Patrick: But i think yes
[2025-05-27T20:20:05] Patrick: Maybe there is code on github for it

[2025-05-27T22:19:00] haku: im really curuious on what happened
[2025-05-27T22:19:08] Yamal: Yes soon !
[2025-05-27T22:19:18] Yamal: Never take out the controller yet ..
[2025-05-27T22:21:01] D: If I use 5V of CAN and also GND from CAN, can I configure my rear light or will it be permanently on?
[2025-05-27T22:22:26] D: By configuring I mean changing settings so it blinks in a different way or even turning it off via settings
[2025-05-27T22:26:25] Yamal: Let's see if I can take a moment and unscrew the heatsink. It's incredibly complicated because the screws are too long and the ratchet bases are too small. I have to remove both controllers to clean the heatsink, change thermal paste, and drill new holes for the new controller.
[2025-05-27T22:29:29] Yamal: In addition to installing a new BMS, to prevent fires in the controllers and to prevent them from being repairable

[2025-05-28T19:27:19] haku: i need to move out of this heathen city
[2025-05-28T19:27:26] Pandalgns: Guys, on a 10-inch 40h 1000w motor, how many magnets should I put in to correctly calculate the speed? How many magnets do they usually have? More or less
[2025-05-28T19:27:31] 'lekrsu': Yes
[2025-05-28T19:30:36] haku: will i be welcome in sweden?
[2025-05-28T19:31:06] haku: will the darker variety of asian be welcome there?
[2025-05-28T19:32:49] 'lekrsu': You're welcome to open another boba tea shop
[2025-05-28T19:33:36] 'lekrsu': Short two phases without esc and count the stops for a full rotation. That's your pole count at gear 1 ratio.
[2025-05-28T19:33:46] haku: that will be front shop
[2025-05-28T19:34:08] haku: but ill also have a laundry mat
[2025-05-28T19:34:24] Pandalgns: And the transmission ratio is mandatory to set it to 1 so that it marks correctly, right?
[2025-05-28T19:41:40] haku: this is the color i want for peak g30v2
[2025-05-28T19:41:48] haku: i need to find this truck when i paint it
[2025-05-28T19:41:57] 'lekrsu': At 1 you can merely put physical magnet count, rather than pairs.
[2025-05-28T19:42:17] 'lekrsu': Nice color
[2025-05-28T19:42:22] 'lekrsu': no need to clean it
[2025-05-28T19:43:54] haku: yep. desert sand color
[2025-05-28T19:44:13] haku: this color or forest green matte
[2025-05-28T19:44:31] Yamal: Nice color yes !
[2025-05-28T19:56:56] Pandalgns: Ooohhh now I understand, that parameter is to set whether they are pairs or units

[2025-05-28T20:58:48] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Abs over current always getting with mxlemming
[2025-05-28T20:59:11] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Less acceleration of the bat for some reason
[2025-05-28T20:59:23] Pandalgns: It has almost never happened to me, once in a while but almost never.
[2025-05-28T21:02:02] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: How much u open abs max ?
[2025-05-28T21:02:34] Pandalgns: Absolute current??
[2025-05-28T21:05:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes
[2025-05-28T21:05:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Absolute motor current or however it's called
[2025-05-28T21:06:06] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_23590@28-05-2025_21-06-06.jpg>
[2025-05-28T21:09:32] Pandalgns: In the zcougar I have 200 abs and 150 phase and in the halo I have 350 phase and about 450 abs.
[2025-05-28T21:10:37] Pandalgns: If you put 300 in phase, find the minimum limit for abs.
[2025-05-28T21:10:52] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: To me that setting Will give cutout but I use also 30a fwk
[2025-05-28T21:11:03] Pandalgns: Around 420 430 and you will see how it will barely give you an error
[2025-05-28T21:11:13] Pandalgns: I use 125 a fw 😏
[2025-05-28T21:11:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Have friends put how much the vesc will let them the most the better

[2025-05-28T21:11:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And what battery
[2025-05-28T21:11:57] Pandalgns: 60h 3000w stock motors
[2025-05-28T21:12:12] Pandalgns: Batt 60v 100a stock 😂😂
[2025-05-28T21:12:24] Pandalgns: About 105 110 kmh max

[2025-05-28T21:15:07] Pandalgns: I don't know, haha, I have phases changed to AWG 12 and the motors don't get too hot when I push them hard, they get warm but they don't burn out at all.
[2025-05-28T21:16:27] Pandalgns: In any case, I don't trust that this battery is giving me everything I'm asking for since I know I'm asking too much of it and it's not a high discharge by any means, everything will be 100% when I put in the new battery 😁
[2025-05-28T21:30:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Guys how much is too hot ?
[2025-05-28T21:31:13] Pandalgns: When I push the scooter hard for a while I can touch the motors without taking my hand off and it doesn't burn me.
[2025-05-28T21:31:41] Pandalgns: They are a little hot but I didn't get burned at all.

[2025-05-28T21:58:23] haku: how many chickens does it take to produce these
[2025-05-28T22:12:03] Yamal: Well, they are still really starting out because they are young. I discard the two older ones, meaning when they are at full capacity they will produce 5 eggs a day
[2025-05-28T22:14:38] haku: 5 eggs per chicken is good
[2025-05-28T22:14:49] haku: i want that
[2025-05-28T22:16:33] Yamal: No no no
[2025-05-28T22:16:51] Yamal: 1 chicken 1 egg every day

[2025-05-28T22:29:01] Yamal: Over current why
[2025-05-28T22:29:16] haku: he lived the american dream.
[2025-05-28T22:46:05] Smart Repair: I used the same settings that worked well for another x12 yesterday 🤷‍♂️ I'll test the motor detection tomorrow. I previously had the x12 beta with terminals, so maybe they work differently... I have no idea.
[2025-05-28T22:58:03] Yamal: Crazy project
[2025-05-28T22:58:25] Yamal: Dual x12 + 26s battery
[2025-05-28T22:58:34] Smart Repair: I always update the firmware when I change systems. The x12's motor detection is simply crap.

[2025-05-29T00:22:53] haku: how i bend forks evenly to fit a 125mm axle motors

[2025-05-29T00:25:42] Noname: 80h rear and send it
[2025-05-29T00:26:16] haku: this frame is shit. but smaller by a few cm
[2025-05-29T00:26:27] haku: better compact design
[2025-05-29T00:26:34] Noname: 2wd g30 motors and give to kid
[2025-05-29T00:27:07] haku: true. i have a f series motor too
[2025-05-29T01:00:04] haku: im an idiot. shouldve removed pedals first before cranks. but shit is rusted bolt
[2025-05-29T01:18:17] haku: rear is 132mm. hmm
[2025-05-29T01:18:44] haku: i think i will scrap this project and get another fatboy frame
[2025-05-29T01:19:17] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: 🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅🦅
[2025-05-29T01:21:07] haku: yessir
[2025-05-29T01:21:35] haku: american tools for american projects
[2025-05-29T01:22:48] haku: im betting this tool is from ali but with an american made wrap
[2025-05-29T01:24:51] haku: front dropout only 105mm
[2025-05-29T01:25:06] haku: the fatboy frame is 120mm i think
[2025-05-29T01:25:07] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: this looks like "boycott china" shirts made in china
[2025-05-29T01:26:01] haku: Noname my best buddy and right hand man 😜. can i send you the frame and extend dropouts to fit 10" qs motor
[2025-05-29T01:28:20] haku: Noname https://youtu.be/bWcASV2sey0?si=S-ztGT-zsot4kfQZ
[2025-05-29T01:50:00] Noname: <animation>
[2025-05-29T03:53:22] haku: hows this tire performing boy
[2025-05-29T03:54:05] haku: im in need of a tire rotation or new tires.
[2025-05-29T04:13:19] haku: <video_file>
[2025-05-29T04:23:48] Noname: Tires rotate whenever you ride it though?
[2025-05-29T04:24:12] Noname: You mean time to go for a ride?
[2025-05-29T04:24:53] Noname: Looks like your front end is favoring the R side a bit though
[2025-05-29T04:25:49] haku: yea. thats why when i stretch forks its uneven
[2025-05-29T04:26:12] haku: i mean rotate back tire to front
[2025-05-29T04:27:06] haku: this is what i wanted to fix in peak g30v2.2 so even forks.
[2025-05-29T04:30:04] haku: i think perfect motor for this frame is lonnyo 65h or vsett. no need to over stretch the forks and rear dropout can maybe fit brakes
[2025-05-29T04:32:15] haku: also need a display so bad. going 50mph not very safe. i cant help myself
[2025-05-29T04:35:14] Jason: 11x6 when
[2025-05-29T04:35:17] Jason: ultimate torque
[2025-05-29T04:35:22] Jason: will backflip for sure
[2025-05-29T04:35:26] Jason: also tow a semi
[2025-05-29T04:35:36] haku: small esp32 when?
[2025-05-29T04:35:45] Jason: I need to find which size display fits
[2025-05-29T04:36:12] haku: does ly make 11x6?

[2025-05-29T04:47:41] haku: wait till the skatepark videos come out.
[2025-05-29T04:51:37] Noname: How does a display add safety lol. Just buy a GPS speedometer for 12$
[2025-05-29T04:53:37] haku: needs to look professional but jank. you feel me dawg
[2025-05-29T04:55:00] haku: small esp32 or yellow display like @Un_Jason did vertical style
[2025-05-29T04:58:35] Noname: Ok buy a used phone make a mount and have all the info.
[2025-05-29T04:59:10] haku: thats lame. you need to charge
[2025-05-29T05:00:07] haku: i have to represent what vesc is about. open source. that display will blow minds in a penis shape
[2025-05-29T05:00:42] haku: we small controllers but big dicks. you feel me dawgs
[2025-05-29T05:01:52] Noname: Use 5v on vesc to a cable
[2025-05-29T05:02:39] haku: no i will use yellow display script
[2025-05-29T05:02:53] haku: thats what we about dawgs
[2025-05-29T05:03:21] Noname: Whatever I'll be out riding without a care what my gauges say
[2025-05-29T05:03:36] haku: show these far fars we got better displays. custom with penises
[2025-05-29T05:04:41] haku: i fully embraced the open source. free cad, vesc next is linux
[2025-05-29T05:04:54] haku: but im a freeloader unfortunately
[2025-05-29T06:49:08] ✨🇪🇸عمر: good !!
[2025-05-29T06:52:42] Yamal: I'm glad! Nice to hear
[2025-05-29T06:53:25] Yamal: Tomorrow I'll be a week without the scooter, and it's feeling like an eternity
[2025-05-29T06:53:35] Yamal: 🗣️
[2025-05-29T07:11:05] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Pretty good could be better
[2025-05-29T07:11:43] haku: white smoke like new pope?
[2025-05-29T07:11:58] haku: very dense?
[2025-05-29T07:17:55] haku: ooh feeling like mr. EU tonight. fancy.
[2025-05-29T07:19:28] haku: help me RFK. you need to ban this foods. im autistic and a overweight diabetic
[2025-05-29T07:22:33] Yamal: You live like king hehe
[2025-05-29T07:24:56] haku: i only partake in sweets yamal
[2025-05-29T07:25:27] haku: no nutrients. just sugar and fat
[2025-05-29T07:29:47] Yamal: But because it's really what you like, chocolate and squats
[2025-05-29T07:29:54] Yamal: xD
[2025-05-29T07:30:21] Yamal: How about American chocolate?
[2025-05-29T07:30:32] Yamal: Any brand ?
[2025-05-29T07:31:04] Yamal: I like your fondness for peanut butter.!
[2025-05-29T07:31:28] Yamal: Is really good better than chocolate 💪
[2025-05-29T07:37:07] haku: i like it all tbh. whatevers available and cheap
[2025-05-29T07:37:27] haku: i need to quit this. very very bad
[2025-05-29T07:37:53] haku: i already quit before. i think i lasted 2 and a half months
[2025-05-29T07:38:53] haku: need to get that 12pack batman abs yamal. maybe just maybe i have a chance racing alongside fast girl
[2025-05-29T07:39:53] haku: a shredded haku is a mean haku. like a starving pitbull
[2025-05-29T07:53:17] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-05-29T07:53:57] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-05-29T07:55:00] haku: when i hire you for haku industries lead vesc and display designer. we can talk. right no mini esp32 no contract
[2025-05-29T07:55:40] Jason: yes display
[2025-05-29T07:55:42] Jason: always
[2025-05-29T07:55:52] Jason: just gotta find display rn and development starts
[2025-05-29T07:56:00] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-05-29T07:57:01] haku: let me see that vertical display you have right now
[2025-05-29T07:57:48] haku: the one on your ninebot
[2025-05-29T07:58:00] Jason: pic on old phone
[2025-05-29T07:58:04] Jason: and that display
[2025-05-29T07:58:08] Jason: im not satisfied with it
[2025-05-29T07:58:10] Jason: too big
[2025-05-29T07:58:25] haku: oh gotcha. still cool though
[2025-05-29T08:28:33] Yamal: ‼️❗️
[2025-05-29T09:18:48] Smart Repair: Short test drive with motor detection and 250A phase. Promising without ABS
[2025-05-29T09:26:18] Yamal: 21600 lest g0❗️
[2025-05-29T09:26:42] Yamal: Pretty nice power
[2025-05-29T09:27:05] Yamal: Also fet temp
[2025-05-29T09:27:26] Yamal: Only with 250A ‼️❗️🤯
[2025-05-29T09:27:40] Yamal: X12 monster athomE!!!
[2025-05-29T09:29:35] Yamal: Enjoy man enjoy!
[2025-05-29T09:45:25] Rose: Hey there Celso, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-05-29T10:29:48] Smart Repair: Rear 250A and Front 140A The torque is really nice... I'm slowly working my way up... My goal should be 30 kW. It's just a shame that the traction up front is so poor.
[2025-05-29T11:10:49] TrentXWB: Hi guys - can you recommend a stronger motor with open size = 110 mm? My Wheelway 1200 w motor only accepts 80 phase amps to run smoothly. Is there a chance to widen the rear frame on a Xiaomi 4 Ultra?
[2025-05-29T11:10:49] TrentXWB: <photos/photo_23598@29-05-2025_11-10-49.jpg>

[2025-05-29T11:10:50] TrentXWB: <photos/photo_23600@29-05-2025_11-10-50.jpg>
[2025-05-29T11:12:34] Yamal: Absolutely amazing
[2025-05-29T11:16:03] Yamal: Traction control, raising the rpm to 5000/6000, is also an option, but I decided to stop using it due to the loss of power. I currently prefer to put all my weight on the handlebars for aggressive rides
[2025-05-29T11:16:33] Yamal: I mean fast exit,,?
[2025-05-29T11:20:18] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/i03_9UX3wjY?si=yRV0swzX38vhdmkF
[2025-05-29T11:20:26] Yamal: Really look nice
[2025-05-29T11:28:44] Smart Repair: I have the GT1 motor with 40 poles in the front and a 70h motor with 30 poles in the rear. TC doesn't work with them. I decided against 2x 70h motors. The GT1 motor is sufficient for the front.
[2025-05-29T11:30:39] Yamal: So the project is complete!
[2025-05-29T11:30:46] Smart Repair: There's a solution to every problem. Just remove the cover and take a look. I recommend the ly 10" 65h 17x4. The best motor for single
[2025-05-29T11:58:45] TrentXWB: Is there another sheet metal on the market (different bending) to make it wider or do I have to do it on my own? Do you have a link for this ly motor?
[2025-05-29T12:00:52] TrentXWB: This one? Do you know the mm for installation?
[2025-05-29T12:12:27] Unknown: its a lonnyo 10inch 65H
[2025-05-29T12:12:33] Unknown: should be 125mm dropout
[2025-05-29T12:14:38] TrentXWB: If I chose the 40H Version I will have 110 mm dropout size?
[2025-05-29T12:25:17] 'lekrsu': Custom order from Lonnyo directly and specify.
[2025-05-29T12:46:38] Patrick: Had one of these and it was the worst rotor ever
[2025-05-29T14:22:16] Dualtron Achilleus: Selling lonnyo rims 140€ for 75h 80h 90h 100h motor 11inch

[2025-05-29T14:55:34] Yamal: :(
[2025-05-29T15:18:02] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: for a piece? I'm going to put mine up for sale too ☺️

[2025-05-29T15:35:59] Rose: Hey there Sb, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-05-29T16:35:54] Matthew: @jamessoderstrom i just received my 100/100 lite. I was wondering what fets do you guys change to to have the controller run a bit safer? And how much should changing fets cost from a computer shop?
[2025-05-29T16:36:18] Matthew: Just an idea if it is kinda industry standard
[2025-05-29T17:07:27] skrtt: The red rubber is to seal it?
[2025-05-29T17:22:38] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If it is the rubber that we put in the center of the rings
[2025-05-29T17:31:26] Matthew: Im only going to run 40amps battery 14s
[2025-05-29T17:31:38] Matthew: Was thinking 100phase
[2025-05-29T17:32:13] Matthew: But i dont want to stress the thing beyond being kinda reliable.
[2025-05-29T17:45:52] skrtt: 70h soon eheheh
[2025-05-29T19:49:14] Yamal: https://youtu.be/bbaC5FPtn7s?si=JoC73sSLbThl8asN
[2025-05-29T20:08:00] haku: whats that for?
[2025-05-29T20:08:31] skrtt: Spacers for the dt arms
[2025-05-29T20:08:46] skrtt: To fit bigger motors
[2025-05-29T20:09:20] haku: oh i see

[2025-05-29T20:10:39] Yamal: Pretty cool xD
[2025-05-29T20:23:26] haku: g3 is nice. i agree
[2025-05-29T20:24:11] Yamal: https://youtu.be/Zd5Wo8ai85I?si=dK7XHYV6mRAC_Q0
[2025-05-29T20:31:45] haku: that ridicoulous
[2025-05-29T20:32:09] haku: scooter is huge. might aswel sitdown
[2025-05-29T20:33:44] Yamal: 😹
[2025-05-29T20:34:13] Yamal: 🦦
[2025-05-29T20:36:17] haku: i dont know man. i like small things
[2025-05-29T20:42:00] Yamal: 👯‍♀️
[2025-05-29T20:46:16] haku: what happened? future lead vesc designer of haku industries?
[2025-05-29T20:59:50] haku: good price
[2025-05-29T21:00:39] haku: tempting but budget cuts
[2025-05-29T21:04:01] Yamal: How is your BMS Haku
[2025-05-29T21:04:08] Yamal: From Wepoor battery
[2025-05-29T21:04:20] haku: good idea need to check
[2025-05-29T21:04:22] Yamal: I need order one
[2025-05-29T21:05:32] haku: <photos/photo_23609@29-05-2025_21-05-32.jpg>
[2025-05-29T21:05:33] haku: <photos/photo_23610@29-05-2025_21-05-33.jpg>
[2025-05-29T21:06:04] haku: its good. but it fucked me when i was wiring it.
[2025-05-29T21:09:05] Yamal: I mean
[2025-05-29T21:09:09] Yamal: Aspect
[2025-05-29T21:09:16] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_23611@29-05-2025_21-09-16.jpg>
[2025-05-29T21:09:29] Yamal: Like 400/420continuos 1000 peak
[2025-05-29T21:09:50] Pandalgns: New 180mm 3mm thick discs and slick tires
[2025-05-29T21:09:54] Pandalgns: 😍😍
[2025-05-29T21:10:29] haku: <photos/photo_23612@29-05-2025_21-10-29.jpg>
[2025-05-29T21:10:44] haku: i think its this one i used for the wepoor.
[2025-05-29T21:10:47] haku: not sure
[2025-05-29T21:21:32] haku: what tires hombre. i am in need of one
[2025-05-29T21:22:02] Pandalgns: 110/50/6.5 slicks
[2025-05-29T21:22:10] haku: ooh to wide
[2025-05-29T21:22:18] haku: need 90
[2025-05-29T21:22:29] Pandalgns: Yes, they look really fat.
[2025-05-29T21:22:39] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_23613@29-05-2025_21-22-39.jpg>
[2025-05-29T21:23:34] haku: that old tire you have is the one im using too. need to replace or kill it fully
[2025-05-29T21:24:06] haku: 90/65/6.5
[2025-05-29T21:24:13] Pandalgns: The old ones are too tight for me 😂😂
[2025-05-29T21:24:37] Pandalgns: And they are too flat, these new ones are rounder
[2025-05-29T21:25:04] haku: yes. i need a rounder profile on a 90/65/6.5
[2025-05-29T21:25:27] Pandalgns: There are the same ones as mine in 90/65/6.5
[2025-05-29T21:25:31] haku: the fake pmt stardales is also good
[2025-05-29T21:25:47] haku: nice. ill check it out
[2025-05-29T21:26:26] Pandalgns: Ahh these are totally fake 😂😂 but let's see how they go for 20 euros each, they look soft
[2025-05-29T21:26:53] haku: its soft. oh no good for summer here
[2025-05-29T21:27:15] haku: soft is sticky
[2025-05-29T21:27:37] Pandalgns: Today it was 34 degrees here where I live and it's not even summer yet 😂😂
[2025-05-29T21:28:13] haku: is it this same tire
[2025-05-29T21:28:33] Pandalgns: And where I live is the north of Spain, which is the area with the coldest and rainiest climate in Spain.
[2025-05-29T21:28:52] haku: very nice.
[2025-05-29T21:29:09] Pandalgns: Totally the same
[2025-05-29T21:29:14] haku: gotcha
[2025-05-29T21:29:18] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_23615@29-05-2025_21-29-18.jpg>
[2025-05-29T21:29:22] haku: its in my cart lmao
[2025-05-29T21:29:51] haku: it its too soft. not good for burnouts and hot pavement
[2025-05-29T21:30:54] Pandalgns: When I get the hall sensors to replace the damaged ones and the brake fluid, I'll have a couple of weeks of disassembling, cleaning, fixing, maintaining, and reassembling everything and with luck I'll buy what I need for the MoliCel battery. Tomorrow I'll get 20 more cells to finally make 22s.
[2025-05-29T21:31:53] Pandalgns: I also need to buy new seals and new oil for the front shock absorbers, one of which keeps leaking and they've been feeling very soft lately. Let's see if I can put in a slightly thicker oil and harden them a bit.
[2025-05-29T21:33:24] Yamal: Crazy
[2025-05-29T21:33:40] Yamal: Only 230 A continuous and still okay ?
[2025-05-29T21:33:45] Yamal: Never cut ?
[2025-05-29T21:33:54] Yamal: I mean you nominal is like
[2025-05-29T21:34:11] Yamal: 504A ?
[2025-05-29T21:39:19] haku: yea no cuts.
[2025-05-29T21:39:26] haku: 575a max
[2025-05-29T21:39:58] haku: this one is what im also using on samsung 40t 20s10p. but never tested that yet
[2025-05-29T21:40:50] haku: this hobby expensive 😭
[2025-05-29T21:41:12] haku: for me new tires every month seems like
[2025-05-29T21:41:32] Pandalgns: Too expensive 😂😂 I can't afford everything
[2025-05-29T21:41:49] haku: same. thats why i recycle old parts
[2025-05-29T21:42:03] haku: only buy new when the project is legit
[2025-05-29T21:42:35] haku: like peak g30v3 plaid edition. that will have top of the line parts
[2025-05-29T21:44:33] Pandalgns: I only put new parts on the halo, for the zcougar everything is recycled 😂😂 recycled motors that I had before, not the battery, that one is new, but recycled controllers, an 84100 of those I used before in the xiaomi and a 75100 of the first ones I bought, recycled chassis, recycled handlebars hahaha the old one from the halo.... recycled brakes.... everything recycled and yet he asks for money this one too 😂😂
[2025-05-29T21:46:10] Yamal: @jamessoderstrom
[2025-05-29T21:46:26] haku: i feel you man.
[2025-05-29T21:46:56] haku: mine actually need welded parts. and welder is hourly job
[2025-05-29T21:47:14] Yamal: Do you think a BMS like Haku's would be good for my drums and use?
[2025-05-29T21:47:15] haku: isnt that right Noname
[2025-05-29T21:47:50] Pandalgns: Don't talk to me about welded parts and hourly metal work... I need it and it depresses me just knowing how much I'm going to spend on it 😂😂
[2025-05-29T21:59:19] Yamal: I really don’t know the real one ,,, never see
[2025-05-29T21:59:50] Yamal: But in my controller i have 175A per controller
[2025-05-29T21:59:58] Yamal: 350A both ?
[2025-05-29T22:00:54] Yamal: But I see now almost same price than 400continuos
[2025-05-29T22:00:57] Yamal: …
[2025-05-29T22:01:13] Yamal: I see ,, tomorrow I want to order one
[2025-05-29T22:03:37] haku: 400 continous? whats peak 700?
[2025-05-29T22:04:01] haku: can 40t push that?
[2025-05-29T22:07:37] Yamal: Not man
[2025-05-29T22:07:53] Yamal: I mean
[2025-05-29T22:08:15] Yamal: 400 is better than 230A continuous right
[2025-05-29T22:08:23] Yamal: Like big door ?
[2025-05-29T22:08:52] haku: sure. but 20s10p 40t batteries cant sustain 400 unless built for it
[2025-05-29T22:09:00] haku: not a pro
[2025-05-29T22:09:28] haku: i say get it. better overbuilt than underbuilt
[2025-05-29T22:10:12] Yamal: Tomorrow I see the better price o get
[2025-05-29T22:10:19] haku: buy on sale.

[2025-05-29T22:10:42] Yamal: Controller really arrive , tomorrow o get
[2025-05-29T22:11:02] Yamal: Arrive later at work , but still clouse
[2025-05-29T22:11:15] haku: once i got a 22s 200 ish peak ant bms. for $30
[2025-05-29T22:11:47] haku: i think 325 peak actually

[2025-05-29T22:18:24] skrtt: Manuel make for me 50€ for 20
[2025-05-29T22:19:16] Pandalgns: What??
[2025-05-29T22:19:27] skrtt: You know manuel
[2025-05-29T22:19:29] skrtt: Right?
[2025-05-29T22:19:53] Pandalgns: Cell supplier??
[2025-05-29T22:19:57] skrtt: Yes
[2025-05-29T22:20:39] Pandalgns: I don't know him, I think he's the last contact a friend who lives near me gave me, but he doesn't have a p45b, I think only a p42a. The p45b are sent to me by a guy from Barcelona.
[2025-05-29T22:20:50] skrtt: I bought one module from him. And i was missing 20 cells to make 10p. He sold 20 cells for 50€
[2025-05-29T22:20:58] skrtt: He have
[2025-05-29T22:21:07] skrtt: I bought from him monday
[2025-05-29T22:21:33] Pandalgns: It may be the same if
[2025-05-29T22:22:07] Pandalgns: But I don't know, it's a supplier I've never bought from yet, my friend got me the 20 I'm missing.
[2025-05-29T22:22:39] skrtt: <photos/photo_23616@29-05-2025_22-22-39.jpg>
[2025-05-29T22:22:49] skrtt: Oh ok
[2025-05-29T22:23:11] skrtt: I thought u were searching to buy those 20
[2025-05-29T22:23:52] Pandalgns: I already have them ordered, they will arrive tomorrow 😂😂 but thanks for the information bro
[2025-05-29T22:29:37] Yamal: I really need to look for a smaller BMS, because carrying 400 continuous with 1000 peak is like not having a BMS I think xD, as I am now, I would never cut, open door? xD
[2025-05-29T22:35:20] haku: ant has different styles
[2025-05-29T22:37:58] Yamal: Excited! I'm going to try the new 85/240! In combination with the 85/250! Viking variant
[2025-05-29T22:39:05] Yamal: I hope everything goes well 🤲
[2025-05-29T22:42:49] haku: wait theres a new 85/250 releasing. ask james
[2025-05-29T22:45:16] Yamal: The 85/250 is no longer in stock, now it is replaced by the 85/240

[2025-05-29T23:41:38] Yamal: What I like about the 250 is the way it is anchored, remaining separate from the box itself,
[2025-05-29T23:41:45] Yamal: Easy
[2025-05-30T00:02:06] Noname: Ask them never to ship with Usps they suck

[2025-05-30T02:44:14] haku: nothing atm. im thinking of getting a similar frame like peak g30v2 stretch forks evenly and weld a bracket mount
[2025-05-30T02:45:44] haku: <video_file>

[2025-05-30T03:04:20] Matthew: Theres these weird adapter brackets we use building them motorized bicycle builds that could be something to check out...
[2025-05-30T03:04:28] Matthew: <photos/photo_23620@30-05-2025_03-04-28.jpg>
[2025-05-30T03:04:33] Matthew: <photos/photo_23621@30-05-2025_03-04-33.jpg>
[2025-05-30T03:05:53] haku: good idea. but since my motor is a laotie it will not fit brakes in the rear. the tolerance is very tight
[2025-05-30T03:06:00] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: but that's for rear
[2025-05-30T03:06:39] Matthew: <photos/photo_23622@30-05-2025_03-06-39.jpg>
[2025-05-30T03:08:31] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: But imho, better to weld front adapter than do that with this adapters
[2025-05-30T03:08:46] haku: <video_file>
[2025-05-30T03:09:08] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: dude, that's a brakes
[2025-05-30T03:10:28] Matthew: Yeah, doubt theyd work.... just wanted to throw them out there as a possibility
[2025-05-30T03:10:28] haku: this mini bmx peak g30 frame is a wierd frame.
[2025-05-30T03:10:52] Matthew: I dont have good feelings about these things
[2025-05-30T03:12:34] haku: this is the thing with wierd builds. or first off builds
[2025-05-30T03:12:47] haku: need big brains
[2025-05-30T03:13:30] haku: unfortunately mine has been smoothed out overtime
[2025-05-30T03:13:53] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Lol i have this thing. Looks bad
[2025-05-30T03:14:14] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Weld "IS" and then use postmount adapter
[2025-05-30T03:14:17] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: that's all
[2025-05-30T03:14:45] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: It's really even easy but needs some instruments and yeah, welding machine
[2025-05-30T03:24:50] Matthew: How do we log while we are riding? Ive never logged anything before. Just done the record my screen video...
[2025-05-30T03:34:01] Rogerio Figueiredo: <video_file>

[2025-05-30T05:58:35] Yamal: Only 17-24s but no good right
[2025-05-30T05:58:59] Yamal: 61,2v is the minimum v
[2025-05-30T06:00:07] Yamal: But maybe okee
[2025-05-30T06:00:28] haku: what do you mean?
[2025-05-30T06:00:31] Yamal: Is like 0,5% battery
[2025-05-30T06:00:36] Yamal: For 20s
[2025-05-30T06:00:49] haku: 61.v is very bad for 20s

[2025-05-30T06:02:21] Yamal: I'm talking about BMS Ant Haku, my battery is around 80V
[2025-05-30T06:02:48] haku: oh ok
[2025-05-30T06:03:02] Yamal: I mean, I only find powerful BMS that take 17s24s
[2025-05-30T06:03:14] haku: yes ant
[2025-05-30T06:04:01] Yamal: Can’t find 7-20s
[2025-05-30T06:04:21] haku: there should be on ali
[2025-05-30T06:04:38] Yamal: But the one I mean 61,2 is okee for minimum voltage
[2025-05-30T06:05:30] Yamal: But yes ,,,, I continue searching ..
[2025-05-30T06:08:16] haku: sure
[2025-05-30T06:10:11] skrtt: How many nominal and peak u need?
[2025-05-30T06:11:14] skrtt: 220A 550A is good for u?
[2025-05-30T06:11:52] Yamal: I think continuous current a little more better
[2025-05-30T06:12:26] Yamal: The problem all i can find is BMS 17s-to-24s
[2025-05-30T06:12:39] skrtt: W8
[2025-05-30T06:12:44] Yamal: That mean minimum voltage is 61,2

[2025-05-31T14:43:38] Hackintoshhhh: Electromagnetic fields cause reproductive harm
[2025-05-31T14:43:46] Hackintoshhhh: This is really no joke
[2025-05-31T14:44:05] Hackintoshhhh: And over 15kW i think its strong enough to really cause harm
[2025-05-31T14:48:00] Mirono escooters: What
[2025-05-31T14:48:15] Mirono escooters: If you have a pacemaker sure 😂

[2025-05-31T14:53:13] Hackintoshhhh: Reproductive harm. Having powerful emf between your nuts is as bad as it gets

[2025-05-31T15:13:29] Hackintoshhhh: Yea
[2025-05-31T15:30:06] S1m 0n: Is there a ratio of battery and phase current that one should maintain? I have an 84100hp. My cells can deliver 75A and the BMS 80A I have bat current max 55A, bat Regen max 30A. Phase 70A (Detection Result says 68-71A), Ebrake 60A (Hall 3pin, not Switch 2pin), Max Over Current 130A and 40A FW I use the Kaabo Mantis 10 motor 60V/1kW/45H and have a 13s battery. I reach a stable top speed of 65km/h (254mm diameter 10") at 3.5kW acceleration and 2.2kW to maintain speed. Vesc temperature is stable around 50°C
[2025-05-31T15:49:28] Rob Ver: I think I have some power loss when start from 0kmh it goes away and come back
[2025-05-31T15:49:45] Rob Ver: <photos/photo_23650@31-05-2025_15-49-45.jpg>

[2025-05-31T16:32:46] S1m 0n: I think I remember correctly that my 75100 V1 was also displayed as 75300 3 years ago
[2025-05-31T17:44:47] L000: Guys how do you mount your vesc, I have mine in the g2 and idk how to mount it so it stays cool

[2025-05-31T17:47:17] 'lekrsu': Printed an adapter for the alu lite to the charger bolt and squished it with a 0.5mm thermal pad. Others have used thermal glue.
[2025-05-31T18:03:20] Noname: They need mounting ears. Can always cut them off. Just got an 85/240 and not happy with the mounting screws
[2025-05-31T18:04:20] Noname: Ah finally my niece is riding the pink segway I got her like 2 years ago lol

[2025-05-31T18:08:18] William Tremblay: gnd and 5v for the throttle
[2025-05-31T18:08:43] L000: The 85 150 is too big also doesn’t fit diagonally
[2025-05-31T18:14:39] 'lekrsu': Wdym, 85240 fits?
[2025-05-31T18:19:14] Yamal: <video_file>

[2025-05-31T21:07:21] Noname: Do I have to print zip ties in Nylon now
[2025-05-31T21:07:26] Noname: That's criminal pricing
[2025-05-31T21:07:26] Noname: Found the cheaper ones
[2025-05-31T21:09:46] haku: this harbor freight
[2025-05-31T21:12:50] ausias: in Spain on the "chino" we have like 50 zip for 3 €
[2025-05-31T21:26:31] Matthew: Harbor freight or amazon be the best for us locally. I can get 6 rolls black electric for $5.
[2025-05-31T21:34:01] Patrick: 20s7p if you have a spacer for esc?

[2025-05-31T23:14:37] haku: but they do carry alot of stuff
[2025-05-31T23:28:59] Noname: Good zip ties. Home depot has GB and they suck ass
[2025-05-31T23:29:42] haku: those are the ones that crack in the cold yea
[2025-05-31T23:30:50] Noname: Or snap and you punch your forehead

[2025-06-01T00:16:13] skrtt: Can every vesc have a 25kmh limiter if needed?
[2025-06-01T00:16:24] skrtt: Im afraid of police 👮‍♂️
[2025-06-01T00:17:32] Noname: Yes
[2025-06-01T00:17:47] skrtt: Good to know
[2025-06-01T00:18:01] skrtt: But remotely?
[2025-06-01T00:20:48] Noname: Idk honestly. Some people have had sequence of brake taps to put in a different mode but I think that's custom programming.
[2025-06-01T00:54:31] Yamal: Just make one profile 25kmh “ permanent “,, and another one “no limited “until rebound “” no remember the exactly name XD, so when you off the scooter and on again still have 25kmh
[2025-06-01T00:56:46] haku: idk if i should hate or combine forces with this dude. peak g30 builder too. https://youtube.com/shorts/SIMq_KQ6qVk?si=LpU9lhyo1Y96lqOn
[2025-06-01T00:57:57] skrtt: And how can I change?
[2025-06-01T00:58:08] skrtt: Only through the vesc app?
[2025-06-01T00:58:16] skrtt: Cuz I need sum fast
[2025-06-01T01:00:31] haku: he copying my style. original peak g30 is mine. youve seen it here first. https://youtube.com/shorts/DnBalN1QTzs?si=uugAwelX22CVbhC0
[2025-06-01T01:05:58] haku: i will put up my official yt soon
[2025-06-01T01:08:30] haku: like i said boys there are jank builds and there are jank but clean builds. you feel me dawgs
[2025-06-01T01:29:21] Matthew: Are the controllers capable of having different front and rear tire diameters and working fine? Im guessing no, but very curious about it
[2025-06-01T01:39:04] Matthew: I raised the height on my scooter to fit a 13-14" tire on the front. For non vesc esc dual motor do you think it wont work probably have errors maybe?
[2025-06-01T01:39:26] Matthew: <photos/photo_23661@01-06-2025_01-39-26.jpg>
[2025-06-01T08:25:52] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I know the builder he wants to get vescs but don't nothing about it
[2025-06-01T08:34:38] haku: im sure hes lurking here. copying my build. even his verbage on his videos are like mine.
[2025-06-01T08:36:24] haku: my next peak g30 will be a secret build only the haku indistries executives will know. i will not post until completed
[2025-06-01T09:27:37] S1m 0n: I guess it's green. At least in the German IO Murks version of the Mantis 10 and Vsett 10.
[2025-06-01T10:01:52] Rob Ver: What FOC settings do you hawe on strong builds over 30KW
[2025-06-01T10:02:15] Rob Ver: <photos/photo_23662@01-06-2025_10-02-15.jpg>

[2025-06-01T11:31:32] Yamal: The only thing is that every time you turn on the e-scooter, you have to go to the app to set it to "unlimited" mode. So the best solution if the police stop you is to turn off the e-scooter! Because it's faster than opening Vesc Tool to change the mode.

[2025-06-01T13:34:26] Rob Ver: Amater 🤣 this battery is for babies

[2025-06-01T15:15:48] S1m 0n: I'm not sure. Every Chinese e-scooter uses this cable harness. Orange should be vBat. Pink is on/off detection (Vbat → DS). White could be the brake, black is always GND. But some wires also split at the top. You have to check each wire several times for continuity to others and make a note of it.
[2025-06-01T15:42:16] William Tremblay: makes sense alright thank you!

[2025-06-01T19:12:43] haku: post video here on telegram. a platform for grown men
[2025-06-01T19:23:16] Yamal: Man 2 Friday ago
[2025-06-01T19:23:25] Yamal: https://youtu.be/TQNW0_RRicI?si=fVntq3HMQvieZsA9
[2025-06-01T19:23:58] Yamal: I don’t know why I’m going in this moment like 35kmh, now I want to put BMS
[2025-06-01T19:24:22] Yamal: Because the one I have is only for charger like 40A

[2025-06-01T20:02:38] Noname: Temp sensor connects to ground+ temp or 5v and temp?
[2025-06-01T20:07:13] Unknown: temp and gnd i believe it was
[2025-06-01T20:08:37] skrtt: Cant wait to mount the motors
[2025-06-01T20:23:22] Yamal: <photos/photo_23674@01-06-2025_20-23-22.jpg>
[2025-06-01T20:29:14] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If they have continuity they are broken but as Yamal says this machine is here
[2025-06-01T20:29:17] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: He encontrado esto en AliExpress: 9,28€ | Dispositivo de reparación electromóvil, Detector de mantenimiento de Scooter, Motor sin escobillas, controlador Hall, 24V/36V/48V/60V/72V, 1 piezas https://a.aliexpress.com/_EuEqumA
[2025-06-01T21:01:04] Pandalgns: Yes, but that machine is used with the wiring and motor enclosed, right? You connect the cable, turn the motor, and it tells you if they're OK or not, right? What I want to know is if there's a way to check if they're OK directly from the board.
[2025-06-01T21:02:04] Pandalgns: Because it is quite tedious for me to open the engine since due to the thick cables I cannot remove the entire cover, I have to leave the bearing on the shaft since it does not come out with the cables.
[2025-06-01T21:29:41] Matthew: <animation>
[2025-06-01T21:31:47] Patrick: You mean on top of the cells? Cause looks like there is a lot of space on top
[2025-06-01T21:33:40] 'lekrsu': There's no usable space above as the cover goes above and also into the chassis height. But look at the printed cells, below the ledge, you can't do that.
[2025-06-01T21:34:17] Patrick: Custom Cover when
[2025-06-02T00:13:25] haku: how many chickens to produce that
[2025-06-02T00:15:23] haku: this is the mood today @jamaludin_algarnati no one disses my battery builds. we umderstanding. https://youtu.be/5DfqsVmd2wI?si=7IfBgY0zIUGHZdtj

[2025-06-02T00:29:18] haku: anus exposure is the reason for that
[2025-06-02T00:30:04] Noname: About 5.4kw and it gets to 70c. Still on 60a battery but more phase helps

[2025-06-02T06:46:27] Yamal: I hope everything goes well with the new controller, because I was really on cloud nine experimenting with the UBox with 20s over 80h 33/2+600A phase, a truly brutal and fun experience.
[2025-06-02T07:10:40] haku: @jamessoderstrom i told i wasnt trolling. https://youtube.com/shorts/PKw5Zod6iRU?si=g5EOn8aJRdgjl_Av

Honestly, I still don't know which path to choose: one engine/two engines/// 20s5p/6p, and I'd also like to get a larger scooter certified and approved in my country, like the Dualtron Thunder 3 or Achilleus Limited. These would be future projects. And of course, get the Nami Toro running. We're just a few weeks away from the official start of summer, and as such, the return of early morning and nighttime routes would be a real joy! And today is Monday!!! Noooooooo xD
[2025-06-02T07:13:03] haku: theres alot of scientific data about this now
[2025-06-02T07:13:21] Yamal: Creatine always good
[2025-06-02T07:13:42] Yamal: Long time never eat sport suplementos
[2025-06-02T07:13:56] Yamal: I need time ,,
[2025-06-02T07:13:57] Yamal: XD
[2025-06-02T07:14:10] haku: well you get creatine in red meat and fish anyway
[2025-06-02T07:14:23] Yamal: Yes I mean
[2025-06-02T07:15:21] Yamal: For me, supplements require consistency and a high level of training
[2025-06-02T07:15:59] haku: agreed. but supplementing with creatine is always good. just makes you bloaty
[2025-06-02T07:16:21] Yamal: I'm still starting to get things moving, but we're making progress. A diet high in protein and fat is key, leaving carbohydrates aside a bit in my case.
[2025-06-02T07:16:50] haku: you want that 12 pack batman abs
[2025-06-02T07:20:07] Yamal: ;)
[2025-06-02T07:20:13] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-06-02T07:21:02] Yamal: XD
[2025-06-02T07:22:42] Noname: Very good, educational video. I'll sleep well
[2025-06-02T07:26:26] haku: that rim you have what is it amd where you buy?
[2025-06-02T07:26:30] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-06-02T07:28:03] haku: serious question dude. is it tubeless split rim aswell?
[2025-06-02T07:29:13] haku: peak g30 v3 plaid edition might need this rim because its skinny. if i can afford. how muchos?
[2025-06-02T07:29:28] Yamal: <video_file>
[2025-06-02T07:37:09] Yamal: Haku, I just remembered that you asked me about the chickens' eggs,
[2025-06-02T07:37:30] haku: im more interested on the custom cnc rim now
[2025-06-02T07:37:58] haku: is that rage mechanic trottinette rims?
[2025-06-02T07:40:52] haku: i have a plan. make the peak g30v3 plaid edition and race those vegas euc guys in the track
[2025-06-02T07:41:33] Yamal: I actually have 7 hens, of which 5 are young (the red ones) and two old ones that are barely laying eggs anymore, I have to replace them too and make a good chicken broth xD, the eggs I caught yesterday are from the new hens, and there were 11 eggs in 4 days, when they are at full capacity there will be 20 eggs in 4 days, about 35 eggs a week,,
[2025-06-02T07:41:37] Yamal: Okee
[2025-06-02T07:41:41] haku: slap thier butts when i pass em
[2025-06-02T07:41:46] Yamal: Túbeles rim always
[2025-06-02T07:42:10] haku: who sells em
[2025-06-02T07:43:15] Yamal: Those for inner tube wheels are not reliable from my experience.
[2025-06-02T07:43:34] Yamal: Tubeless like moto or car the best
[2025-06-02T07:43:42] haku: i agree
[2025-06-02T07:43:50] Yamal: Is just amazing
[2025-06-02T07:44:08] Yamal: From my Dt thunder
[2025-06-02T07:44:08] haku: what rim is that you have?
[2025-06-02T07:44:20] haku: will it fit narrow tires
[2025-06-02T07:44:22] Yamal: I have cnc one
[2025-06-02T07:44:30] Yamal: Ninebot stock
[2025-06-02T07:44:41] Yamal: But still tube tires
[2025-06-02T07:44:54] haku: where you buy cnc and how muchos if you dont mind me asking
[2025-06-02T07:45:08] Yamal: Ambrosini ones

[2025-06-02T07:45:22] Yamal: He is just in my country
[2025-06-02T07:45:28] Yamal: So is easy
[2025-06-02T07:45:28] haku: gotcha
[2025-06-02T07:45:33] Yamal: And cheaper””
[2025-06-02T07:45:40] Yamal: But LY have
[2025-06-02T07:45:45] Yamal: 10”///11”
[2025-06-02T07:45:46] haku: it will fit any lonyyo?
[2025-06-02T07:45:54] Yamal: For sure
[2025-06-02T07:46:43] haku: 155 axles will fit fatboy frames. just need a pro to stretch it evenly
[2025-06-02T07:47:52] haku: ill look up thier website
[2025-06-02T07:53:51] Yamal: But
[2025-06-02T07:54:15] Yamal: Me you can get in China
[2025-06-02T07:54:43] Yamal: They come from there xD
[2025-06-02T07:57:02] haku: ooh is it really
[2025-06-02T07:58:47] Yamal: Yes
[2025-06-02T07:58:55] haku: ok
[2025-06-02T08:00:16] Yamal: I don't have the contact right now, but I know they come from there and can be obtained.
[2025-06-02T08:01:53] haku: need research
[2025-06-02T08:02:14] haku: maybe @PaoloWu knows
[2025-06-02T08:03:47] Yamal: Ask James also
[2025-06-02T08:03:58] haku: true
[2025-06-02T08:04:44] Yamal: Buddy
[2025-06-02T08:05:03] haku: yea pal. whats up
[2025-06-02T08:05:14] Yamal: When Wepoor is fixed, you'll never touch a mini BMX again in your life.
[2025-06-02T08:05:21] Yamal: :)
[2025-06-02T08:05:52] haku: wepoor might be too hot in police eyes atm. not to sure unless i ride it
[2025-06-02T08:06:40] Yamal: 200/300/70h 🤩
[2025-06-02T08:07:01] Yamal: 20sbabyp
[2025-06-02T08:07:10] Yamal: 12 p mean xD
[2025-06-02T08:07:53] haku: tbh mini bmx peak g30 with insane parts would be where its at. these new high discharge cells make it more lightweight for the same amps wepoor pushing
[2025-06-02T08:08:48] haku: scary at high speeds but it carves corners easy
[2025-06-02T08:10:13] haku: wepoor with new high discharge cells like 22s12p would be cool too. but that require expensive vescs
[2025-06-02T08:10:35] Yamal: Why
[2025-06-02T08:11:00] Yamal: Now we know ubox with new fet, work pretty well
[2025-06-02T08:11:05] Yamal: Really happy
[2025-06-02T08:11:13] haku: you paid for the whole 12p use all the amps
[2025-06-02T08:11:32] haku: just my opinion
[2025-06-02T08:12:29] Yamal: You can with ubox
[2025-06-02T08:12:39] Yamal: 200/220 per controller?
[2025-06-02T08:13:03] Yamal: a lot of battery current
[2025-06-02T08:13:06] Yamal: 250/////
[2025-06-02T08:13:09] Yamal: 240/////
[2025-06-02T08:13:24] Yamal: So 200 safe ?
[2025-06-02T08:13:28] haku: sure with p42. but new tabless cells 50pl
[2025-06-02T08:13:49] Yamal: And you can think in x12 man
[2025-06-02T08:13:49] haku: thats like 500a per vesc
[2025-06-02T08:13:56] Yamal: It’s just in your country
[2025-06-02T08:14:16] Yamal: I can see before 2 board like 600$ before
[2025-06-02T08:14:29] Yamal: Or less
[2025-06-02T08:14:37] haku: yea 500 is lowest ive seen
[2025-06-02T08:14:45] haku: 2 boards

[2025-06-02T12:55:02] Dimos: Is decoupling helpful ? I have never tried it
[2025-06-02T12:55:24] Dimos: I use this guide https://endless-sphere.com/sphere/threads/vesc-tuning-tips.125527/

[2025-06-02T15:35:01] Yamal: If the police stop you, they'll take your scooter, so it's better to go straight ahead... If they're on a motorcycle, you'll have a tough time
[2025-06-02T15:36:25] Rob Ver: I'm at 200A battery and 310A phase on 80h 22x3 and front only 190A batt and 190A phase.

[2025-06-02T15:40:13] Yamal: Really don’t know xD
[2025-06-02T15:40:23] Rob Ver: Not 40
[2025-06-02T15:40:37] Rob Ver: Continious 45A and peek 140A

[2025-06-02T15:42:53] Yamal: You don't need less amps in front, start taming it, put all your weight on the handlebars/stem with malice! so the wheel doesn't spin
[2025-06-02T15:43:08] Yamal: ^^’

[2025-06-02T15:47:13] Rob Ver: Maybe it will be better
[2025-06-02T15:47:24] Yamal: The controller holes look less than 4mm, right?
[2025-06-02T15:47:58] Rob Ver: Mounting holes
[2025-06-02T15:48:20] Rob Ver: I think it's m3
[2025-06-02T15:48:31] Rob Ver: I'm not at home to look at

[2025-06-02T16:19:22] Yamal: Also Ly rim? <80mm>?

[2025-06-02T16:33:25] Noname: Its M2.5 sucks
[2025-06-02T16:46:17] Noname: Just jam a tap in it no need to disassemble. Wish they gave some screws with it
[2025-06-02T16:46:43] Noname: M3 is smallest hardware store has and my RC car stuff is 2mm
[2025-06-02T16:47:27] L000: Guys what should I change with mxlamming observer I get overcurrent error idk what I should change so that it works
[2025-06-02T16:48:43] Yamal: difficult task to mount it on my heat sink carpet
[2025-06-02T17:05:15] Noname: I'm not happy about no ears. Mounting the 100/100 to heatsink was a cunt. The 85/240 is on flat alum. Still had to countersink because no space
[2025-06-02T17:13:13] Forol1561: Ikik
[2025-06-02T17:13:43] Forol1561: No 7P only with spacer removed iirc
[2025-06-02T17:14:06] Forol1561: But at that poi t who tf even needs a 72V 35AH pack .. Lol
[2025-06-02T17:16:31] Forol1561: I mean.... I would.... But def not most people lol
[2025-06-02T17:18:41] Forol1561: You can fill up the ledges with smart space usage.... For example if you fit the pack in and slide it all the way unde one of the ledges... You have space for the bms or a thin charger or VESC's under the other ledge + some breathing room
[2025-06-02T17:22:22] Rob Ver: Rim is 110/100 motor 80H

[2025-06-03T07:12:41] Yamal: I hope to be able to work on the heat sink this afternoon
[2025-06-03T07:14:50] Yamal: The truth is that it is favorable for the temperatures as we Namis carry the electronics, but on the other hand it is always a little exposed to humidity, rain, etc., for those of you who carry the electronics inside it is always safer
[2025-06-03T07:15:30] Yamal: Only a few competitors isolate the electronics in the namis, which makes it really cool
[2025-06-03T09:43:20] Marius: Next to the people just walking there minding their own Business 😭
[2025-06-03T10:50:25] ausias: im going to put the 85240 in here with a custom 3d case, and on the other part of the chasis the Heat sinks

[2025-06-03T13:32:52] Pandalgns: @AYO744
[2025-06-03T13:36:54] Pandalgns: Where can I get those gaskets you have to make a tubeless rim?
[2025-06-03T13:50:02] Rose: Hey there Vancouver, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-06-03T13:52:19] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: That O-ring is not suitable for all engines. I think they can sell it in bearing and seal stores.
[2025-06-03T13:53:04] Pandalgns: And what size is it? It's basically a gasket that seals the union of the two rings, right?
[2025-06-03T13:54:11] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, it is, but it is placed in a "rail" to make the seal.
[2025-06-03T13:54:37] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I'll tell you the measurements later
[2025-06-03T13:57:13] Pandalgns: Perfect, thank you.

[2025-06-03T21:27:54] Yamal: Man
[2025-06-03T21:28:06] skrtt: New thunder is 4300 here
[2025-06-03T21:28:10] Yamal: Why only 120 front ?
[2025-06-03T21:28:25] Yamal: Stock motor?
[2025-06-03T21:28:40] Yamal: Can’t handle 200///180A ?
[2025-06-03T21:28:47] Yamal: Battery A ?
[2025-06-03T21:28:56] Yamal: Same here

[2025-06-03T21:29:31] Yamal: Right
[2025-06-03T21:30:02] skrtt: Anything more than 4kw its considered a motorcycle
[2025-06-03T21:30:13] Yamal: Who know
[2025-06-03T21:30:17] Yamal: XD
[2025-06-03T21:30:21] Smart Repair: Yes, gt1 engine. 85A Batt, 120A Phase.. even at 80kmh the tire still spins
[2025-06-03T21:30:35] skrtt: So u need license and placa and insurance
[2025-06-03T21:30:46] skrtt: But 👮 dont seem to care

[2025-06-03T21:34:57] skrtt: Maybe when racing teams see my leaning skills they will sponsor me so i can go to the track
[2025-06-03T21:41:42] Yamal: Everything is very expensive in this hobby, motors /// high-discharge batteries /// Vesc controllers /// high-end bicycle brakes /// it is inevitable that we like the good things
[2025-06-03T21:42:27] Yamal: You just have to be patient and little by little things will come
[2025-06-03T21:44:20] Yamal: I'm clear that I need two VESC vehicles, in case one breaks down, as is the case here. If I now had the G2 Max with a 20S5P single or 20S6P dual + VEDDER speed controller, that would be great and wonderful.
[2025-06-03T21:44:38] Yamal: 25kmh……

[2025-06-03T21:45:37] Face de Pin Sucé: Prototypes yes, but not for production, price is too high for french machining, we would be obligated to sell at 400+€/rim which is way too high for this market
[2025-06-03T21:46:05] haku: agreed.

[2025-06-03T22:36:10] Yamal: :)

[2025-06-03T22:53:09] Matthew: Is there a reason why my vesc is shutting off from temps 10°c cooler than I have programmed. I have programmed 105°cut off and it started throttling off at 91°c and shut-off at 95°c.
