[2024-04-15T15:15:41] haku: the world likes smog, air pollution and noise pollution. same thing happened to vapes. big tobaco tried bringing them down
[2024-04-15T15:16:02] Yamal: And if you see it very badly, and you don't see light at the end of the tunnel, go live in Korea and ride Vesc on the wepeds!
[2024-04-15T15:16:38] haku: they use fardrivers there i think
[2024-04-15T15:16:49] haku: same in the US
[2024-04-15T15:17:16] haku: big dumb controllers but powerful
[2024-04-15T15:37:47] GABE: Is 8 awg fine for phase wires ya
[2024-04-15T15:37:51] GABE: @jamessoderstrom

[2024-04-15T17:49:15] puneDir: Is nickel enough for 20s20p
[2024-04-15T17:49:18] puneDir: Or i need copper
[2024-04-15T17:54:42] puneDir: it's gonna be for e bike
[2024-04-15T17:57:30] Jan: And then 2 milliamps BMS?
[2024-04-15T17:58:34] puneDir: No
[2024-04-15T17:58:38] puneDir: 200a jk or ant

[2024-04-15T19:44:03] haku: great lets see this new masterpiece
[2024-04-15T20:13:25] Diego: Guys I tried to modify the Xiaomi controllers to run a bit (18s) but there are more problems than the rest... vesc is a more stable and long-lasting alternative to make a Xiaomi travel properly or even here the faults are behind the corner? I don't want to mess around with smd components
[2024-04-15T20:16:21] GABE: Lmao
[2024-04-15T20:16:22] GABE: copper.
[2024-04-15T20:18:39] Mirono escooters: If his cells are 5a per, nickel :)
[2024-04-15T20:18:51] Mirono escooters: S and p don't matter for nickel copper question..
[2024-04-15T20:19:10] puneDir: 10
[2024-04-15T20:19:56] Mirono escooters: Nickel fine if layout allows it
[2024-04-15T20:26:48] Unknown: You buy install configure and use. Modifying something beyond limits is always problems
[2024-04-15T20:27:57] puneDir: you sure?
[2024-04-15T20:29:16] Mirono escooters: I doubt your layout is the optimal
[2024-04-15T20:29:24] Mirono escooters: But dude's, come on MATH

[2024-04-15T21:10:53] haku: dam we all repping james suce holders
[2024-04-15T21:11:09] Mirono escooters: Fallout is out now
[2024-04-15T21:11:51] haku: now its about who makes it the prettiest
[2024-04-15T21:13:41] GABE: You forgot the
[2024-04-15T21:13:43] GABE: balance wires
[2024-04-15T21:13:45] GABE: omg
[2024-04-15T21:14:13] haku: im not running a bms üòú
[2024-04-15T21:14:21] haku: unlimited power
[2024-04-15T21:14:25] GABE: huh
[2024-04-15T21:15:28] haku: i will do ebike guy style. no bms
[2024-04-15T21:18:07] haku: dam need to check that out when i have time
[2024-04-15T21:41:11] haku: how do you even charge balance a 20s without bms?
[2024-04-15T21:41:27] haku: grin charger?
[2024-04-15T21:46:24] haku: those rc chargers only have 6-8s
[2024-04-15T21:46:38] haku: i wonder how ebike guy do it
[2024-04-15T21:47:23] Happy Giraffe: Bit pricy as I just wanna see speed, motor temp and battery charge lever
[2024-04-15T21:47:32] haku: if you set the voltage to 84v. will it automatically balance all p groups?
[2024-04-15T21:49:27] GABE: you can wire the balance in parallel
[2024-04-15T21:50:34] Happy Giraffe: But so far a nice ready made solution as it seems taking trampa 2 years to do a manual ob their screen
[2024-04-15T21:50:51] puneDir: Me
[2024-04-15T21:51:25] puneDir: With 0.96 oled
[2024-04-15T21:51:34] puneDir: If it's enough
[2024-04-15T21:51:49] puneDir: Also if you want i have st7789 one too
[2024-04-15T21:52:06] haku: what you mean?
[2024-04-15T21:52:57] Happy Giraffe: ü§î
[2024-04-15T22:00:40] puneDir: I have shit small one And some bit better and bigger one

[2024-04-15T22:12:29] haku: finally we get some midrive vesc content here
[2024-04-15T22:12:37] puneDir: 21 cm without shaft
[2024-04-15T22:12:58] haku: have you opened it yet?
[2024-04-15T22:14:19] puneDir: No
[2024-04-15T22:14:36] puneDir: I still haven't received it
[2024-04-15T22:14:41] puneDir: But it's torque monster
[2024-04-15T22:14:50] haku: gotcha.
[2024-04-15T22:15:43] haku: 21 cm would fit a scooter for sure
[2024-04-15T22:15:55] haku: mid drive scooter haha
[2024-04-15T22:16:31] haku: you be king of the burnouts

[2024-04-15T22:53:51] haku: that heatsink looks legit. so mucg metal in it. long fins too
[2024-04-15T22:54:40] Yamal: I still have to sand and make everything nice, make the anchoring holes for the chassis and the controllers, my family won't let me do anything...üò≠
[2024-04-15T22:54:46] haku: you have the link to that heatink. looka good
[2024-04-15T23:00:55] Yamal: https://a.aliexpress.com/_EwHRnNN
[2024-04-15T23:01:33] Yamal: Now there are many more measurements than when I started looking!
[2024-04-15T23:01:54] haku: thanks dude
[2024-04-15T23:04:01] Unknown: How much heat these fuckers make? Feel like I should heatsink the whole bottom of my scoot now
[2024-04-15T23:06:12] haku: i dont know about the 85/200 but the dual 100/100 gets pretty hot
[2024-04-15T23:07:57] Unknown: Idk what to use to mount it properly but I would üòÜ
[2024-04-15T23:09:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: Depends by hardware, more is the dissipated power , bigger heatsink you need to put
[2024-04-15T23:09:39] Yamal: The truth is that by taking the electronics outside I have not had major temperature problems, everything is within normal limits, even giving it a go and doing speed tests, it has been on the circuit when I have seen higher temperature peaks and I know that this I set this key in Vesc, from there to put this, also my electronics is "small" for what it delivers and I think it will be good for you!
[2024-04-15T23:10:27] Unknown: What is normal Temps min/max
[2024-04-15T23:11:06] GABE: <photos/photo_14345@15-04-2024_23-11-06.jpg>
[2024-04-15T23:11:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs not like that, the contact surface to the air is very little, so it wouldnt cool the controller , since the surface is not enough
[2024-04-15T23:11:34] GABE: ant BMS has a 9s pin, just enough for the external. Call that luck XD
[2024-04-15T23:11:44] GABE: so hot
[2024-04-15T23:11:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: All depends by how much watt the controller dissipate
[2024-04-15T23:12:07] Unknown: Yeah but it looks üòé cool like a diffuser on a car. Mabey better stability with large fins üòÜ
[2024-04-15T23:13:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: Spintend dissipate half of watts compared to tronic ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2024-04-15T23:14:10] haku: did you mount it inside or outside?
[2024-04-15T23:15:01] Yamal: what are you talking about ?
[2024-04-15T23:15:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs like cpu, if you put super brand new ryzen with 5nm technology you can cool even with 5‚Ç¨ heatsink, but if you‚Äôve 28nm amd fx you need like giant noctua
[2024-04-15T23:15:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: MOSFET resistance produce heat, I‚Äôm talking about resistance difference
[2024-04-15T23:15:50] haku: lol. i relate to this

[2024-04-15T23:20:14] puneDir: But still heats up quickly
[2024-04-15T23:20:28] puneDir: Maybe because I'm pushing 180a
[2024-04-15T23:21:01] Unknown: Well my Nuculars ran 48c 210a with no thermal pads just sitting in the deck for a day.
[2024-04-15T23:21:21] haku: how many mosfets that one?
[2024-04-15T23:21:39] Unknown: 12
[2024-04-15T23:24:23] haku: do you guys clean you desktops and re apply thermal paste on the cpu? i was told you have to do this every 2 years
[2024-04-15T23:24:29] GABE: Not much more space than in my pro 2
[2024-04-15T23:25:22] puneDir: It can fit 20s7p + 2 escs
[2024-04-15T23:25:28] Unknown: It dries out apparently
[2024-04-15T23:26:00] haku: yes. it does.
[2024-04-15T23:26:08] NetworkDir: With 45cm extender ofc
[2024-04-15T23:26:27] haku: i dont know if the heat will still transfer with dried thermal paste.
[2024-04-15T23:26:33] GABE: I'm holding my battery like a baby
[2024-04-15T23:26:40] GABE: Nah
[2024-04-15T23:26:53] NetworkDir: Without extender 2 ubox with good cooling and 20s5p without holder with world's hardest layout possible üòÇ

[2024-04-15T23:27:48] haku: then folks have to do this on escs too then
[2024-04-15T23:27:51] GABE: 21700

[2024-04-15T23:28:06] GABE: and 2x space for escs on bottom
[2024-04-15T23:28:09] haku: thats pretty wiring
[2024-04-15T23:28:49] haku: what scooter will that go to?
[2024-04-15T23:28:55] puneDir: Elshans zero
[2024-04-15T23:28:58] puneDir: Cengiz battery
[2024-04-15T23:29:00] NetworkDir: Yes very hard layout and because holderless need good isolation
[2024-04-15T23:29:12] GABE: he always makes crazy layouts like this
[2024-04-15T23:29:17] NetworkDir: Mine scooter on zero 10x
[2024-04-15T23:29:29] NetworkDir: He is really genius
[2024-04-15T23:29:46] haku: why not vertical standard layout?
[2024-04-15T23:29:53] GABE: more space sometimes
[2024-04-15T23:30:02] GABE: certain situations like with honeycomb when you don't care about width
[2024-04-15T23:30:09] GABE: Really depends on the circumstances
[2024-04-15T23:30:15] NetworkDir: Can't fit without extender
[2024-04-15T23:30:25] GABE: Didn't cengiz do 20s8p on g30
[2024-04-15T23:30:27] NetworkDir: Actually i hate extenders
[2024-04-15T23:30:34] GABE: they're clean tho
[2024-04-15T23:30:42] GABE: better than a bag
[2024-04-15T23:30:46] NetworkDir: 20s10p With 45mm extender :)
[2024-04-15T23:31:03] GABE: I need a 45mm extender for 20s8p
[2024-04-15T23:31:03] GABE: lol
[2024-04-15T23:31:03] haku: looking at that battery i cant figure it out. too much for me to think about
[2024-04-15T23:31:22] NetworkDir: also with moded g30 controllers

[2024-04-16T23:31:51] sombre_enfant: Those seems hard to fit on side for vsett... If with ubox 80150 and llt100A setup isnt strong enough i'll do this
[2024-04-16T23:32:51] sombre_enfant: But 170A ant and 75200 mks
[2024-04-16T23:34:44] haku: dam everyone using bigger bms than thier batterys output.
[2024-04-16T23:35:03] Mirono escooters: A bit of margin is fine. More is useless
[2024-04-16T23:35:09] haku: poor my tiny asian bms
[2024-04-16T23:35:17] Mirono escooters: How many MOSFETs Yes
[2024-04-16T23:36:37] Alin Ciobanu: All ANT are 1.8Mm and 70/73mm

[2024-04-16T23:45:53] NetworkDir: Hmm try to motor setup again (motor detection)
[2024-04-16T23:46:14] NetworkDir: also check phase cable maybe cable ripped

[2024-04-16T23:48:03] NetworkDir: if you have a dual setup connect this motor to another esc and try again. also try to reflash vesc
[2024-04-16T23:55:12] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is single motor
[2024-04-16T23:55:23] Rogerio Figueiredo: I don't have firmware for this esc is the new 84 200
[2024-04-16T23:59:40] NetworkDir: this one?
[2024-04-17T00:04:15] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yes
[2024-04-17T00:04:35] NetworkDir: Firmware name is : MKSESC_84_200_HP

[2024-04-17T05:44:38] Unknown: Thinking of a way to save running multiple wires. Are the gnd/ 5v common supply for throttle/ regen brake? Stock brakes I can parallel to 1 port for a switch type brake.
[2024-04-17T09:21:51] Yamal: CNC

[2024-04-17T14:09:40] Yamal: Geometry ‚ÄºÔ∏èüòÇ
[2024-04-17T14:22:12] Jan: Ive seen you have been writing this a couple of times now, but what do you mean by this? Especially this scooter i dont see your point
[2024-04-17T14:29:46] Yamal: It is simply a new, cool scooter with "features", and the geometry of this e-scooter is surely something unimportant with the excuse of talking about said e-scooter, by the way, with Vesc.
[2024-04-17T14:30:58] Yamal: I could also have said Momen tricher!! Ô∏è‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏èüòÇ which is the same thing
[2024-04-17T14:31:23] Jan: The geometry on this one is actually good. One of very few scooters that looks like they got a basic understanding of engineering
[2024-04-17T14:35:57] Yamal: "off topic" I love this channel ‚ÄºÔ∏èüëåüöÄ
[2024-04-17T14:38:39] Yamal: I hope one day to be able to interact or "help" on the vesc help channel!! but there is still work and learning about this fabulous world!
[2024-04-17T14:43:56] Ion: So my 13S charger broke... This diode desoldered itself while charging lol. What could be the cause of that? I'm assuming just putting it back on is not enough troubleshooting

[2024-04-17T14:51:16] Ion: Oh is this new ADC Board? The old one had screw terminals. For ADC V2 it was common, you could check with multimeter
[2024-04-17T15:05:34] Unknown: Yes this is old V2 with my blinker button connections. They don't use negative wire. Wondering if they are dry contacts etc. Would have liked the screw terminals myself I hate making splices into plugs.
[2024-04-17T15:06:00] Yamal: going back to Momen! very cool that came out recently as "doing" off road in fact esp it is a short there is a slightly longer video on his channel, but without much more than what is seen there! What I said was cool but very very expensive! Who can buy an e-scooter like this to go to work or take routes?üò≠
[2024-04-17T15:13:03] NetworkDir: Does MTPA algo works on normal scooter motors?

[2024-04-17T15:15:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: It will do higher peaks yes but are only peaks, not continuos powef
[2024-04-17T15:16:07] NetworkDir: Hmm so it's can overload (burn) motor?
[2024-04-17T15:18:52] Unknown: FYI I don't have it yet curiosity and waiting is killing me
[2024-04-17T15:32:55] sombre_enfant: This button work with it ?
[2024-04-17T15:43:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs no good if you are very near with in board limit
[2024-04-17T15:45:40] Unknown: Idk if the button indicator lights will work leaving the negative out but as long as the board works at this point its a win
[2024-04-17T16:49:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: No it doesnt
[2024-04-17T16:50:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Only analog ones work good ,also if you familiar with usage of that you know it's not good
[2024-04-17T16:51:55] sombre_enfant: Maybe the ninebot button would works... They the best design
[2024-04-17T16:55:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: G2 type should
[2024-04-17T17:10:27] Unknown: Damn thanks need to either cut board out and isolate buttons or find another.

[2024-04-17T19:36:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: no
[2024-04-17T19:36:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: YYK was just illusion of power
[2024-04-17T19:36:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: but no power
[2024-04-17T19:39:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is like mini motors, only torque in start because give u infinite current
[2024-04-17T19:47:29] Lisa: Oh man, everything alright? No broken bones or so
[2024-04-17T19:47:59] GABE: Nah i fell on my knees
[2024-04-17T19:48:12] GABE: then slid
[2024-04-17T19:48:22] GABE: thankfully had a helmet aswell
[2024-04-17T19:49:43] Yamal: Kelly nerver die ! Same flipsky
[2024-04-17T19:52:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: Flipsky always die hahaha
[2024-04-17T19:53:45] haku: you good walk it off boy.
[2024-04-17T19:55:00] Yamal: how good it is cheap!!! They could sell it in Lidl
[2024-04-17T19:55:43] haku: nothing broken yea?
[2024-04-17T20:06:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes it's the only reason I still buy
[2024-04-17T20:08:05] haku: flipsky and makerbase is hit or miss yea? sometimes good sometimes bad
[2024-04-17T20:08:50] Unknown: üòÖ
[2024-04-17T20:09:31] Yamal: Have you ever tried vesc trampa before?
[2024-04-17T20:11:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: I tested the old version 100/250 and was definitely a ‚Äúshit‚Äù for high load motors
[2024-04-17T20:11:54] Unknown: However you were right, vesc A whole different story!
[2024-04-17T20:11:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: I guess they was designed for esk8
[2024-04-17T20:12:01] Mirono escooters: Barely any movement for a c sus lol
[2024-04-17T20:12:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: With high continuous current they explode and I‚Äôm was not the only one
[2024-04-17T20:13:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: Also the discord group said, the possible reason is because the package is small and solder pad are also small, and because of the high current the solder melts so mosfet moves then üí•
[2024-04-17T20:14:17] Yamal: mirono scooter, which e-scooter are you currently riding,
[2024-04-17T20:15:01] haku: what about g300 vesc. not so much info about it
[2024-04-17T20:15:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: 200a phase as data sheet said
[2024-04-17T20:15:34] haku: 18fet
[2024-04-17T20:15:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: But using 200a phase on small skate motor is different than using it in high kv e-scooter motor

[2024-04-17T20:43:42] haku: anyone in the french el trott racing using this. and is this real specs?
[2024-04-17T20:45:22] haku: not much info on this vesc
[2024-04-17T20:48:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: Face de
[2024-04-17T20:48:28] Yamal: One man in this group with 11x
[2024-04-17T20:48:41] haku: only him i think
[2024-04-17T20:48:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: From experience, used to blow up and take fire easily
[2024-04-17T20:49:00] Face de Pin Suc√©: but I heard they corrected and better now
[2024-04-17T20:49:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: I don't know, burnt too many to buy another one
[2024-04-17T20:49:52] Yamal: Also expensive I think
[2024-04-17T20:50:26] haku: maybe $100 more than spintend 85200
[2024-04-17T20:50:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Anyway wouldn‚Äôt recommend for racing since the cooling isn‚Äôt that good
[2024-04-17T20:51:04] Yamal: Spinted is now on top in terms of everything, right?
[2024-04-17T20:51:33] haku: no idea. very reliable ive read
[2024-04-17T20:51:42] haku: power wise i dont think so
[2024-04-17T20:52:22] Jan: What power are you looking for?
[2024-04-17T20:52:33] haku: for ebikes and mopeds
[2024-04-17T20:52:47] haku: e moto
[2024-04-17T20:52:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think tronic x12 is something very good
[2024-04-17T20:53:16] Jan: 85250 Spintend is really ok for what it easy, super reliable and doesnt know 30¬∞C+
[2024-04-17T20:55:29] haku: 3shul and the big tronics are the only option for e motos e mopeds for now yea
[2024-04-17T20:56:12] haku: something that can support a 16p p45 or p42
[2024-04-17T20:57:31] haku: or 30t
[2024-04-17T21:00:41] Yamal: Today I am unable to think about a bicycle or a motorcycle, electric scooters and their concept have me too hooked
[2024-04-17T21:01:37] Jan: 16P
[2024-04-17T21:01:50] Jan: I would rather go up in voltage but big time
[2024-04-17T21:02:09] Jan: >700Amps is sausage cable
[2024-04-17T21:02:40] Jan: Rather do 40S+
[2024-04-17T21:10:06] haku: i see. 30s the most for vescs though right?
[2024-04-17T21:22:50] Face de Pin Suc√©: not tested sorry x)
[2024-04-17T21:26:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: hahaha I have too many projects
[2024-04-17T21:32:11] haku: this a new video from him. thanks for the upload
[2024-04-17T21:34:59] FOCforever: Thanks James...I meant to do this and forgot.
[2024-04-17T21:38:46] FOCforever: Tell me what you think guys. could turning on enable at the same time as the main power even with precharge potentially blow the controller? I've never applied main power at the same time as enable. I always apply main power well before enabling the controller and so i've never seen this scenario.
[2024-04-17T21:49:16] haku: i have a broken spinny v2. i wonder if i can open it and fix it.
[2024-04-17T21:49:37] haku: ill open it and post photos
[2024-04-17T21:50:48] FOCforever: THe controller has blown twice for no seeming good reason. It will be working for some time, no changes of significance and then it dies. Only reason I can think of for this is the controller is either being used at its limits or something is killing it slowly.
[2024-04-17T21:51:06] haku: no idea. it keeps jumping voltage when it was connected to vesc
[2024-04-17T21:51:36] haku: ill mess around with it. maybe break it more lol
[2024-04-17T21:53:07] FOCforever: Of course this is a schematic and doesn't cover things like an intermittent frame short or stator short. A schematic is what should be, not what actually is. Who knows, what is happening that isn't in the schematic???
[2024-04-17T21:55:06] FOCforever: mosfets...don't know what else, but that almost always takes out gate drivers too.
[2024-04-17T21:56:33] FOCforever: AFAIK its random. Everything is fine and then it's dead. This isn't my EV. I'm passing along what was told to me.
[2024-04-17T21:57:52] Unknown: You want my v1?
[2024-04-17T22:00:55] haku: i dont remember. i need to find the video. this was from last year.
[2024-04-17T22:01:30] haku: let me find the post here. i remember posting it
[2024-04-17T22:01:33] Face de Pin Suc√©: Are you using 12V to power something else ?
[2024-04-17T22:02:58] haku: @jamessoderstrom
[2024-04-17T22:02:58] haku: I was riding my scooter and my throttle is messing up. I did setup input and its buggy
[2024-04-17T22:04:10] haku: gotcha. its the val. whatever that means
[2024-04-17T22:04:15] haku: i did
[2024-04-17T22:04:33] haku: i remember re calibrating this
[2024-04-17T22:04:49] haku: honestly its been so long i forgot.

[2024-04-17T22:11:29] Rogerio Figueiredo: Diferent esc same problem bms cut = blown mosfets
[2024-04-17T22:11:47] NetworkDir: 84200HP rip after bms cut?
[2024-04-17T22:15:08] Konstantin: 98% vesc do it. Trampa too, die xD
[2024-04-17T22:17:49] NetworkDir: Looks ubox safe :D
[2024-04-17T22:18:05] Konstantin: Repeat few times...
[2024-04-17T22:20:41] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 3shul also dont die after bms cut
[2024-04-17T22:20:47] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Tested
[2024-04-17T22:21:27] NetworkDir: best solution using safe currents or 2 battery's in parallelüòÇ
[2024-04-17T22:21:57] Konstantin: <photos/photo_14415@17-04-2024_22-21-57.jpg>
[2024-04-17T22:22:21] NetworkDir: 30s ..
[2024-04-17T22:22:23] puneDir: wtf
[2024-04-17T22:23:03] haku: what vesc is that?
[2024-04-17T22:23:37] Konstantin: Cl350, more chance to survive than ubox. Ubox only more want to live, coz 12v dc has more caps... If add them to flipsky, same +/- results
[2024-04-17T22:23:47] Konstantin: Cl350 xD
[2024-04-17T22:24:45] NetworkDir: At all bms cut when driving is abnormal thing
[2024-04-17T22:25:10] haku: @jamessoderstrom can fix that haha
[2024-04-17T22:25:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: I don't recommend more than 28S for CL350 honestly
[2024-04-17T22:26:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Thats weird, because even shitsky works 23s with 100v components
[2024-04-17T22:26:53] haku: wich flipsky can do 23s
[2024-04-17T22:27:54] Konstantin: 75200
[2024-04-17T22:28:07] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yes
[2024-04-17T22:28:10] Konstantin: Build 1+ y ago. For 1 man ;)
[2024-04-17T22:28:19] NetworkDir: Sad :(
[2024-04-17T22:28:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: I guess it's over voltage, if diode gone like that
[2024-04-17T22:29:12] NetworkDir: or regen with 30s
[2024-04-17T22:29:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: The mosfet datasheet is really weird, I don't know what data is fake, If the internal resistance/current, or maximum nominal voltage
[2024-04-17T22:30:38] Rogerio Figueiredo: But why?
[2024-04-17T22:31:24] Rogerio Figueiredo: Best solution use directa discharge
[2024-04-17T22:32:04] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Agm datasheet?
[2024-04-17T22:32:19] Rogerio Figueiredo: But this 84 200 hp is supposed to be fixed
[2024-04-17T22:33:35] Konstantin: <photos/photo_14416@17-04-2024_22-33-35.jpg>
[2024-04-17T22:35:30] Konstantin: Voltage was? Close to 20s?
[2024-04-17T22:35:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, the iR is too good to be 135v , even top company doesn‚Äôt have these specs , and a random china company have such tech
[2024-04-17T22:41:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes but higher voltage need higher room
[2024-04-17T22:43:02] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, but that guy said he didnt do anything. He turns it on with VIN line and it blows up
[2024-04-17T22:44:19] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Btw, too small details
[2024-04-17T22:46:14] Face de Pin Suc√©: Damn
[2024-04-17T22:48:20] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Looks like maybe logic line need to be under 28s or even much lower, i.e 10s
[2024-04-17T22:48:48] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Just for discuss
[2024-04-17T22:49:39] Rogerio Figueiredo: Not 16s
[2024-04-17T22:58:13] Mirono escooters: I love the g300, but haven't tried myself Friend has tho
[2024-04-17T22:58:26] Mirono escooters: The design is super compact and efficient. Internally perfect, no place wasted

[2024-04-17T23:11:44] Mirono escooters: Well I solder bare wires over a long strip too to combat voltage drop
[2024-04-17T23:11:47] puneDir: Where can i buy this nickel copper mix
[2024-04-17T23:11:49] Mirono escooters: Sometimes

[2024-04-17T23:23:29] GABE: that would turn any cell into MH1
[2024-04-17T23:23:40] haku: thats why use .2
[2024-04-17T23:27:51] puneDir: Reason?

[2024-04-17T23:28:11] puneDir: i maded 4x 0.2
[2024-04-17T23:28:22] puneDir: You solder wire not just solder
[2024-04-17T23:28:35] GABE: I thought youse meant solder on the cell before you put metal on it
[2024-04-17T23:28:44] puneDir: No
[2024-04-17T23:29:54] GABE: Equal to 0.2 copper

[2024-04-18T00:23:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: Bro this type of solder iron is not good for batteries
[2024-04-18T00:24:26] haku: this is the strongest one i have to be able to solder 6awg
[2024-04-18T00:25:20] haku: the other one i have wont be able to even connect a qs8.
[2024-04-18T00:27:20] haku: i want one of those 800w ones. for fast solder
[2024-04-18T00:27:52] Yamal: I have soldered very little, and we are going to make a battery, it gives me respect, better to leave it to a professional!üòÖ

[2024-04-18T00:31:04] Yamal: But hey, one day it will be time to get into the matter, all this is really interesting! I try to do as much maintenance and "modifications" as possible to my e-scooter, but things are serious in the store...
[2024-04-18T00:31:20] Yamal: or with friends from the sector
[2024-04-18T00:31:58] Yamal: Maybe on Sunday you can see Little Force attacking again!

[2024-04-18T00:43:15] Yamal: You are from Portugal ?
[2024-04-18T01:04:38] haku: im guessing lidl is the walmart of europe

[2024-04-18T01:30:53] Yamal: a lot of desert
[2024-04-18T01:30:58] haku: red rock is also nice
[2024-04-18T01:31:26] haku: the problem is if scoot breaks down you have a long walk to go
[2024-04-18T01:31:45] haku: not every where has public transportation
[2024-04-18T01:33:20] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yes
[2024-04-18T01:34:49] Yamal: us the same, on long routes but well a risk you have to take, a colleague or family member can always pick you up, and if not get on a bus, anyway on long routes there is usually no problem, some punctures, little But, realize that to travel many kilometers you cannot go fast, speeds of 40/50kmh on average, there the scooter is relaxed, asleep...
[2024-04-18T01:35:02] Yamal: Also have Mercadona there ! üòÅ
[2024-04-18T01:50:42] rosheee: they get hotter than the normal 250's
[2024-04-18T01:52:32] rosheee: spintend 85250 > tronic 250r ^^' sadly..or tronic 250..
[2024-04-18T01:53:09] rosheee: copper cooler + liquid metal = ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2024-04-18T01:55:02] rosheee: u checked temps ^^'? thermal throttling? hwinfo
[2024-04-18T01:56:44] rosheee: dont overb00st them with 20s
[2024-04-18T01:56:44] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. roscheeee has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-04-18T02:10:33] FOCforever: Agreed...why I think this could be a stator arcing issue or some other intermittent issue possibly.
[2024-04-18T02:28:16] haku: no. but good idea. ill run a benchmark test
[2024-04-18T02:28:49] rosheee: https://www.hwinfo.com/download/
[2024-04-18T02:29:00] rosheee: download this
[2024-04-18T02:29:12] haku: yep thats a good one. thanks
[2024-04-18T02:29:19] rosheee: https://www.ocbase.com/download
[2024-04-18T02:29:59] rosheee: https://msikombustor.com/ for gpu
[2024-04-18T02:30:14] haku: i use heaven benchmark lol
[2024-04-18T02:30:25] rosheee: or 3dmark https://prime95.en.lo4d.com/windows
[2024-04-18T02:31:23] rosheee: never heard of using this since years for oc my pc's
[2024-04-18T02:32:37] haku: im too old to know all these new stuff
[2024-04-18T02:33:04] rosheee: yah me also oldsql.. https://www.techpowerup.com/memtest64/ for ram with correct presets for hyper ram burning tests
[2024-04-18T02:33:34] rosheee: 3dmark is 1998 heaven 2009 ^^
[2024-04-18T02:33:54] haku: thanks. if cpu overheating might need to re apply paste.
[2024-04-18T02:34:02] haku: just a hassle to do
[2024-04-18T02:34:18] rosheee: depends on ur cooling maybe lower voltage as well in bios
[2024-04-18T02:34:31] haku: also my desktop cooler so dirty. full of dogs hair
[2024-04-18T02:34:34] rosheee: vcore n stuff helps also ^^' and achieve higher clock
[2024-04-18T02:34:57] rosheee: then clean üòÜroflc0pter if u have fullcopper cooler -> go liquid metal instead of paste if alu cooler -> DON'T use liquid metal
[2024-04-18T02:35:43] haku: idk what noctua d15 is made of. i think steel maybe
[2024-04-18T02:35:47] rosheee: https://www.coollaboratory.com/shop/
[2024-04-18T02:36:06] rosheee: Material Copper (base and heat-pipes), aluminium (cooling fins), soldered joints & nickel plating
[2024-04-18T02:36:22] haku: nice. never used this stuff before
[2024-04-18T02:36:27] rosheee: then ezpz liquid metal
[2024-04-18T02:36:36] rosheee: if u wanna go full retard cool it direct die ^^'
[2024-04-18T02:37:24] rosheee: which cpu u got? which mainboard?
[2024-04-18T02:37:51] haku: ryzen 7 or 9 i dont remember. and its asus mainboard
[2024-04-18T02:38:05] haku: i forgot the details. i built it in 2020
[2024-04-18T02:39:05] rosheee: ok ^^ for cpu then lower vcore and some other voltages and for gpu same undervolt the shizzl and u can increase clock ^^ lower temps more fuckeria
[2024-04-18T02:39:07] haku: it was difficult to find parts too due to chip shotage
[2024-04-18T02:39:27] haku: thanks bud.
[2024-04-18T02:39:58] haku: when i paint stuff on bambu slicer is when it gets slow
[2024-04-18T02:40:21] rosheee: bambu slicer crap ^^' it just use single cpu not like orca slicer
[2024-04-18T02:40:33] rosheee: idk why they only rely on single core instead mutlicore zomg
[2024-04-18T02:41:01] haku: nice. i didnt know this. maybe ill try orca
[2024-04-18T02:41:01] rosheee: best is with nvidia gpu üòÜthe window lag when u move it on screen
[2024-04-18T02:41:10] rosheee: try it

[2024-04-18T02:41:40] rosheee: my pleasure
[2024-04-18T02:43:55] rosheee: if any questions -> pm but check ur temps. send detailed infos then we can work it out and maybe get some more ‚ù§Ô∏è out of ur hw
[2024-04-18T02:43:59] rosheee: gn8 ‚ù§Ô∏è

[2024-04-18T04:24:40] Rogerio Figueiredo: That motor should be nice no?
[2024-04-18T04:26:00] Rogerio Figueiredo: Should v√™ hight kv or not?
[2024-04-18T04:39:41] Unknown: Ureka I want my turn signals to light up so I'll isolate them with the pile of relays I over ordered.
[2024-04-18T07:10:19] haku: what iron would you recomend bro?
[2024-04-18T07:58:50] Mirono escooters: Hi guys. do you know any ESC with TOLL fets on FR4 board, where the cooling is through the back of the FR4 Board through Thermal Vias?
[2024-04-18T08:06:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: Torp

[2024-04-18T09:00:11] GABE: Heavy.
[2024-04-18T11:04:44] GABE: 100w is more than enough.
[2024-04-18T11:09:50] GABE: U can always ask someone else to hold another iron on the other side lmfao
[2024-04-18T11:10:45] GABE: 200w.

[2024-04-18T11:34:31] üé∏ POSS üèÅ (Crimekillz): monorim are fucking clowns at checkout it was 2,81 usd and now they claim i owe them way more than that
[2024-04-18T11:34:50] üé∏ POSS üèÅ (Crimekillz): for a bunch of screws i could just get from the hw store
[2024-04-18T11:35:35] üé∏ POSS üèÅ (Crimekillz): it wasn't my smartest move i admit but i didn't expect to get outright scammed
[2024-04-18T11:53:52] puneDir: what you was expecting?
[2024-04-18T11:53:59] puneDir: They need to ship them to you
[2024-04-18T11:54:16] puneDir: And why would monoshit pay 16 euro shipping for few screws
[2024-04-18T12:05:11] GABE: 1 trillion other places to get screws from
[2024-04-18T13:01:54] üé∏ POSS üèÅ (Crimekillz): them to stick to the price that it says at checkout and no surprises
[2024-04-18T13:02:21] puneDir: Because shipping fee is different to other places
[2024-04-18T13:02:25] puneDir: What was u expecting
[2024-04-18T13:04:08] üé∏ POSS üèÅ (Crimekillz): it is their fault in the first place when i order two identical disk brake adapter plates and get two different sets of screws, one set being too thick to not rub on the motor cable, so i was like okay sure just get the matching ones it's only 2.81 with shipping to germany. then surprise surprise it isn't after i already have paid for it

[2024-04-18T14:36:25] GABE: is this good?
[2024-04-18T14:36:37] GABE: need something to cut 3mm sheets with
[2024-04-18T14:36:58] GABE: *battery not included OK I'll make my own then fuck capitalism
[2024-04-18T14:37:08] GABE: Alu Sheet to fit under the ESC
[2024-04-18T14:37:23] GABE: make it taller so it fits cause the caps use up lots of space
[2024-04-18T14:37:30] GABE: Id resolder them but I don't have any
[2024-04-18T14:37:38] GABE: I knew I should've kept them. damnit
[2024-04-18T14:37:41] GABE: smh
[2024-04-18T14:38:03] GABE: 2 ALU sheets with thermal glue / paste
[2024-04-18T14:38:03] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-04-18T14:39:52] haku: my small one is 100w. even with the fat tip it takes times to melt the solder and the surface area isnt big
[2024-04-18T14:40:14] haku: what iron you have
[2024-04-18T14:44:08] GABE: Use the help of a small jet lighter
[2024-04-18T14:45:15] haku: if i have a 250w iron wouldnt that be better?
[2024-04-18T14:47:10] haku: it melts solder a little better than the 100w. i use it for big wires and copper. try it
[2024-04-18T14:47:10] Unknown: Grinders suck cutting aluminum. Can use table saw or circular saw.
[2024-04-18T14:48:13] GABE: TF, isn't Alu soft
[2024-04-18T14:48:20] GABE: I've cut aluminium before

[2024-04-18T14:49:04] haku: you fancy boy you
[2024-04-18T14:49:09] Unknown: The grit cloggs like a mofo unless you get alum specific disc. Then it just heats the shit out of the plate.
[2024-04-18T14:49:22] GABE: Yeah I'll get Alu discs
[2024-04-18T14:49:27] Unknown: Table saw 100% straight cut and clean

[2024-04-18T15:23:35] Yamal: of course , ! It has nothing to do with it, I wanted to try it with the discharge battery and there was a strange combination because it was under "construction" nami engine in front, 22/3 rear, stock battery (32ah29E) 132 km/h , standard top speed 96kmh
[2024-04-18T15:24:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: are these 7212?

[2024-04-18T15:27:18] Yamal: Best of all, I have achieved the same top speed with 22/3 and 37A fw, and discharge battery of course, I don't know how much I could have achieved with the speed motors and the battery that I have now but surely around 140kmh, it is worth it ? No! better this way..
[2024-04-18T15:30:13] GABE: so what do you use rn

As I said, then my e-scooter refers to a snake because of the type of chassis, it's a joke that I call it that from time to time!
[2024-04-18T16:24:35] Happy Giraffe: Whats the best way to clean a dirty motor inside? I have two Bafang BBSHD that I gotta clean. Alcohol is ok for winding coating?ü§î @PaoloWu Her0DasH #311

[2024-04-18T16:32:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Alcohol or brake clean , contact cleaner can be good,but not for soaiking In any case air is first ,if mostly dust than that blows shit out , Than apply some on fabric from above and clean
[2024-04-18T16:32:18] Happy Giraffe: Some idiot put some Nivea cream in motor to lubricate I guess. I get motors shortly but asked if I could buy a cleaning solvant at the same time

[2024-04-18T16:33:07] Happy Giraffe: If brake clean leaves small residue alcohol should remove it. I was worried about windings enamel being damaged
[2024-04-18T16:33:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Nah

[2024-04-18T23:54:50] Yamal: I have had the Thunder and now Nami and I have drawn two conclusions: oil hydraulics=comfort elastometers = safety/firmness at high speeds
[2024-04-18T23:55:29] haku: atleast both is better than laotie shit suspension
[2024-04-18T23:58:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: If scooter is well developed hydraulic is better

You have the best, the absolute freedom to be able to move, currently there are a lot of scooters on the market. Personally, I think it's fabulous to take an old model and enhance it, it's like making it better and with more performance than it was before.
[2024-04-19T06:05:19] Yamal: https://youtu.be/pWbMSOdEEpQ?si=Sa-RA8iy_YFzbNqU

[2024-04-19T06:42:57] haku: its good. i think thermal paste doesnt have to be thick. i just needs to be bolted really tight to make good thermal transfer
[2024-04-19T06:52:05] Unknown: Any tighter and the screws gonna snap
[2024-04-19T08:19:15] Yamal: By the way, the dt storm limited will have an even bigger frame or where does the battery go than the dt thunder, right? when wearing 23s...

[2024-04-19T16:10:17] NetworkDir: maybe your phase cables burned and shorted?

[2024-04-19T18:32:51] puneDir: Mks should better send me a new one
[2024-04-19T18:33:29] yoann tsobanoglou: Power cable half cut and blue ripped off. This was not done by pulling. Cables are locked together with healthy length to give in. Just bad positioning and the wheel actually rubs on cables.
[2024-04-19T18:35:27] Yamal: From Alliespress?
[2024-04-19T18:35:31] yoann tsobanoglou: This is not the problem. The problem is for you guys who have like me enabled ebrake, it caused without warning, hard motor brake and resulted in many dangerous loss of control. Maybe firmware could have a fail safe where if voltage doesn‚Äôt variate in a normal manner, some safety cut‚Äôs input. I don‚Äôt know, just thinking

[2024-04-19T21:04:31] sombre_enfant: Whatever 5v?
[2024-04-19T21:05:02] sombre_enfant: Between + and a hall signal for the multimeter

[2024-04-19T21:12:05] Jan: Its a fan car
[2024-04-19T21:12:43] Jan: The fan makes the traction, else even with infinite power wouldnt get lower than about 2.5seconds on semi slicks
[2024-04-19T21:13:06] NetworkDir: Idk check datasheet or old controller

[2024-04-19T21:18:48] haku: oneday folks will be making stuff like this in thier garage. the tech is available
[2024-04-19T21:20:39] Happy Giraffe: Give hall cables 5V and GND, then measure voltage between 5V and yellow/blue/green while spinning motor
[2024-04-19T21:20:54] Happy Giraffe: Voltage reading will jump when spun if they are working
[2024-04-19T21:21:52] Happy Giraffe: I did this using a usb charger so no esc neededüòÅ

[2024-04-19T21:52:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: But multilayer pcb is best because you can reduce much the size of board and put many more components
[2024-04-19T21:53:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is axiom 400v

[2024-04-19T22:40:52] haku: anyone can make a ev with this esc
[2024-04-19T22:41:03] haku: i see
[2024-04-19T22:42:40] FOCforever: Me personally...none at all. What I've been told is that its lots of solder filled copper vias under the mosfets and then thin thermal gap filler to the shell/heatsink. What's on the underside of the board to conduct away heat is very similar to what you see in the 100250 with the DPAK2 mosfets on it.
[2024-04-19T22:43:17] haku: car people addicted to the smell of gasoline.
[2024-04-19T22:43:30] FOCforever: DO you have a milli ohms meter so you can test RDS?

[2024-04-20T00:10:45] NetworkDir: no
[2024-04-20T00:12:47] Yamal: I still think that a large escooter is better, and if you can put 11" motors better
[2024-04-20T00:13:20] Yamal: G30 there are so many cheap second hand,,,
[2024-04-20T00:33:23] GABE: On the rear yes.

[2024-04-20T00:52:51] haku: can that happen though? your welds so strong it can ignite a li ion battery?

[2024-04-20T00:53:55] GABE: Ever
[2024-04-20T00:54:05] GABE: They just smoke a lil and pop if even
[2024-04-20T00:54:27] GABE: If it's low voltage it won't even smoke
[2024-04-20T00:54:41] haku: all i hear is a hissing sound.

[2024-04-20T00:54:48] GABE: Yeah
[2024-04-20T00:56:19] haku: what happens if you dont care if you pierced a cell? like you still finish the battery pack and use it? asking for a friend
[2024-04-20T00:56:47] GABE: If you pierce an EV cell it will probably destroy every cell around it, and possibly cause a TNT like reaction
[2024-04-20T00:56:51] GABE: one cell exploding the other.
[2024-04-20T00:57:00] haku: o snap
[2024-04-20T00:57:08] GABE: Chain reaction.
[2024-04-20T00:57:18] haku: ill tell my friend not to finish his drill battery
[2024-04-20T00:57:34] GABE: You're essentially holding a ticking bomb

[2024-04-20T07:36:01] Yamal: but the truth is that it is true! I have had my brother's Xiaomi for a few weeks and despite it being so bad with clearances, battery in poor condition (a few kilometers ago), very old and used and very little care! Despite all this I have to admit that it is very fun "and it is practical, it weighs so little that it is amazing, if it reached a speed of 45/50kmh it would be the rod!
[2024-04-20T07:45:03] Yamal: It could be fun to have a tuning G30 in the future!!! But we'll see, maybe I'll also have to move to a country where all kinds of e-scooters are prohibited.üò±üò≠

[2024-04-20T22:19:50] NetworkDir: 250A battery current
[2024-04-20T22:19:55] GABE: thought you meant batt there

[2024-04-20T22:20:09] NetworkDir: 800A batt current impossible

[2024-04-20T22:20:30] puneDir: 800a phase will make the cables dance
[2024-04-20T22:20:47] GABE: Absolutely possible.
[2024-04-20T22:21:08] NetworkDir: In vesc config for phase we use 3x batt current
[2024-04-20T22:21:15] NetworkDir: For 70H motor ? Hell no
[2024-04-20T22:21:39] GABE: Imagine

[2024-04-20T22:24:10] GABE: Comparable to a 1000hp Lamborghini power to weight ratio
[2024-04-20T22:24:14] NetworkDir: But kawaski H2r 200kg weight and 310hp
[2024-04-20T22:24:33] GABE: That can't be, electric always has more power to weight
[2024-04-20T22:24:48] GABE: the kart would not be 200kg.
[2024-04-20T22:24:53] GABE: more like 70-90
[2024-04-20T22:25:13] NetworkDir: And it's how can stop/brake ?üòÇ
[2024-04-20T22:25:24] GABE: hydraulic brakes no?
[2024-04-20T22:25:33] GABE: quad
[2024-04-20T22:25:40] GABE: also ebrake works on chain I believe
[2024-04-20T22:25:45] NetworkDir: Maybe 4 calipers yeah
[2024-04-20T22:27:21] GABE: I'll probably be doing 20s10p and 1x qs138.
[2024-04-20T22:27:46] GABE: that's already 30-40hp
[2024-04-20T22:28:02] GABE: 20s8p gives 35hp peak.

[2024-04-20T22:32:23] Happy Giraffe: Should be enough if P45B and well built pack. 30A peak ok. Reaching 600A phase also good
[2024-04-20T22:34:50] GABE: doesn't p42a do 30a constant.
[2024-04-20T22:34:58] GABE: and 45a it releases too much heat
[2024-04-20T22:35:12] GABE: but technically possible to upkeep if cooled?

[2024-04-21T02:16:00] Yamal: I don't do off road, it's simply a 1.5km road of dirt and small stones.

[2024-04-21T11:12:01] GABE: <photos/photo_14581@21-04-2024_11-12-01.jpg>
[2024-04-21T11:12:12] GABE: looks hot honestly but wouldn't goon
[2024-04-21T11:54:24] GABE: this is how I'll have to wire it. route thru the whole scooter cos I put the cells in the inverse way. I should have made them meet in the top..... wtf I was so stupid. I could've just used double copper. Anyway I'm unsure if I'll even have space for this, I might have to use double copper sheets at the ends, and then route 2 giant copper strips around the cell. Cause wire won't fit...
[2024-04-21T12:30:11] GABE: It's looking like I'll only need a 35mm spacer for this build. That's how hard I managed to compact it. I can make it 35 if I resolder caps, 30mm possibly if I modify the pins. This will be incredibly sleek, 29.5mm if I get rid of thermal pad and use good thermal paste. 35/36mm with foam pads, or thinner. @Mirono_escooters @jamessoderstrom I'll have no issues with speed bumps :)
[2024-04-21T12:30:11] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-04-21T13:02:26] haku: what is that. a volkswagen van. never seen that here

[2024-04-22T01:36:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: One caliper is enough to flip you
[2024-04-22T01:36:33] haku: yes heat disipation would be better too i think
[2024-04-22T02:43:45] Unknown: Yeah my buddy has one large brakes
[2024-04-22T02:44:10] Unknown: I'm now regen only and im in love
[2024-04-22T02:45:55] haku: you can actually fit brembo on yours. that be funny
[2024-04-22T02:46:27] Unknown: No need regen just about throws me over the bars at -80a
[2024-04-22T02:47:11] haku: if you use spinny you can fine tune it
[2024-04-22T02:47:35] Unknown: My buddy said they were vicious and pointed at the lever shaking his head
[2024-04-22T02:48:19] haku: i really like regen + spinny
[2024-04-22T02:48:31] haku: thats also the reason i did not do 22s or 21s
[2024-04-22T02:49:28] Unknown: Why you drive 100ft and that's enough depletion for regen to work
[2024-04-22T02:50:53] haku: i mean the ebrake is a good function for me personaly.

[2024-04-22T02:54:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: Get a good brand metallic pads and you will se the huge difference
[2024-04-22T02:55:07] Unknown: I've bought a few different ones

[2024-04-22T03:44:30] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Noname has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-04-22T08:59:33] Finn: Magnets are starting to loose the strength

[2024-04-22T11:25:05] Yamal: Does the FW affect the temperatures of the esc?
[2024-04-22T11:27:23] GABE: Of course!
[2024-04-22T11:52:01] Finn: Sure more amps to compensate torque loss
[2024-04-22T12:39:18] Alin Ciobanu: Do you also have the battery connected to the control unit?
[2024-04-22T12:43:22] Mihail: Yes, the pcb has its own regulator to convert battery voltage to 5V. I've also included inputs for throttle/brake but plan on not using them, since the signals will have to get turned into can messages, which is slower than direct connection. The gas pedal in a Tesla is connected directly to the drive unit, it is probably safer that way.
[2024-04-22T13:05:52] Mihail: I have 120 units of these screens and 360 units with white bezel color. They were discarded from the company I work for, since the product became obsolete and has a newer version. They are IPS panels with touchscreen, resolution is 480x320, usable is 330x320. Im trying to find a way to utilize them for something. Currently wired to esp32-s3 through 8-bit parallel interface and SPI for testing.

[2024-04-22T20:19:42] Unknown: Get a weld helmet you need a dark lenses. Flash burn sucks balls. Feels like sand in your eyes because it legit gives your eyes a sun tan

[2024-04-22T20:55:42] haku: i imagine pulling up on a electric moped destroying 500cc bikes

[2024-04-22T21:00:32] Happy Giraffe: also I dont wanna spend 400e on a light so gotta look in ali, 72v light would save the pain off a dc-dc converter too. Too bad the 50w lights for motorcycles are all 12v
[2024-04-22T21:01:40] haku: what esc you using? why use dc-dc converter. just get a 12v light
[2024-04-22T21:13:23] haku: what is that?
[2024-04-22T21:14:16] haku: same company as molicel?
[2024-04-22T21:14:38] haku: let me look that up
[2024-04-22T21:15:17] haku: @jamessoderstrom always up to date with battery tech
[2024-04-22T21:16:52] haku: nice. its a cylindrical pouch
[2024-04-22T21:17:22] haku: how do you weld that? lazer welder?
[2024-04-22T21:17:54] Happy Giraffe: 12v3a lights are too weak or cost 400e
[2024-04-22T21:18:15] Happy Giraffe: If I can wire to main batt if it 50W I dont have to care about it xd
[2024-04-22T21:19:02] Happy Giraffe: more power :)
[2024-04-22T21:19:33] haku: ali light bar never dissapoints. just point it on an angle. its a wide spread
[2024-04-22T21:20:37] haku: thats what freedom pickup trucks use
[2024-04-22T21:22:59] haku: too bad i cant read german.

[2024-04-23T01:26:40] sombre_enfant: Yeah 300A
[2024-04-23T01:27:02] Yamal: Peak?
[2024-04-23T01:29:00] Yamal: and I suppose that you can give those 300A without problem and without the electronics being overloaded?
[2024-04-23T01:36:26] Yamal: <photos/photo_14620@23-04-2024_01-36-26.jpg>
[2024-04-23T01:36:56] sombre_enfant: Spintend
[2024-04-23T01:37:15] Yamal: Could they compete with this one from Vedder?
[2024-04-23T01:37:36] sombre_enfant: This one actualy bad
[2024-04-23T05:43:21] haku: anyone here has this?
[2024-04-23T06:21:41] haku: finally finished my niece funko pop.
[2024-04-23T09:43:28] Hurriicane: The engine starts very slowly, does not accelerate and there is almost no torque.

[2024-04-23T11:19:18] GABE: does it not come with the mounts???
[2024-04-23T11:20:16] GABE: field weakening took over hahaha
[2024-04-23T11:21:04] Finn: Only forks
[2024-04-23T11:21:21] GABE: hows a person supposed to mount it if they didnt have monorim beforehand then lol
[2024-04-23T11:21:35] GABE: i feel unsafe using the monorim bolts etc.
[2024-04-23T11:22:06] Finn: Its designed for monorim
[2024-04-23T11:23:15] GABE: omg
[2024-04-23T11:32:20] Finn: Arent that 11s8p?
[2024-04-23T11:32:29] GABE: 9s external
[2024-04-23T11:32:33] Finn: Aah olay

[2024-04-23T11:34:22] GABE: <photos/photo_14623@23-04-2024_11-34-22.jpg>
[2024-04-23T11:34:42] GABE: technically 90 but meh, less space for wires. but 10s9p is possible. That would be a 200km range scooter. If we talking 18650 here then ez 20s6p honestly.
[2024-04-23T11:36:47] GABE: With a horizontal Layout 20s5p 21700 is absolutely possible, escs on top, like G30.
[2024-04-23T11:38:28] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Can someone suggest how to assemble 14s5p 18650 battery in pro frame with no extenders and 2 stock escs? üíÄ
[2024-04-23T11:40:00] Finn: Sure
[2024-04-23T11:40:31] Finn: Grind thr mounting holes down and move the escs to the outer
[2024-04-23T11:45:42] Mirono escooters: Replace em?? ü§£
[2024-04-23T11:45:58] Jan: It comes with the brake bracket adapter but you need a monorim suspension as the base
[2024-04-23T11:49:16] sombre_enfant: U can design the other part and make it on jlc pcb or alike if neededd
[2024-04-23T16:18:54] puneDir: Welded the sides

[2024-04-23T21:03:12] sombre_enfant: Yeah kinda if u dont put too much heat... The motor will go max 170 celsius

[2024-04-23T21:27:28] NetworkDir: But i want buy
[2024-04-23T21:27:51] sombre_enfant: 10*5 should fit yes
[2024-04-23T21:32:42] GABE: are they same capacity?
[2024-04-23T21:34:08] haku: no.
[2024-04-23T21:34:58] haku: small difference but very similar cells/performance from what i was told
[2024-04-23T21:35:19] sombre_enfant: No bms i will use rc balance lead, main battery will cut the circuit if theres an issue since its in series
[2024-04-23T21:46:25] Yamal: good news for France, it seems that they have given it interurban roads

[2024-04-24T19:29:40] haku: you know winding and magnet on that motor?

[2024-04-24T20:31:59] haku: idk what all that means but looks good
[2024-04-24T20:36:58] yoann tsobanoglou: We are pushing it a bit more than what we should, we are at 350amp phase motor. But we have noticed that it doesn‚Äôt like to go over 280amps.
[2024-04-24T20:39:19] Yamal: 280A is very good
[2024-04-24T20:39:50] Yamal: more than 500A both motorsü§Ø
[2024-04-24T20:40:58] haku: how much you pushed tronic?
[2024-04-24T20:41:40] Yamal: They said a while ago that they were modifiable so they could be turned on for more than 85v
[2024-04-24T20:45:18] Yamal: With Tronic ? More than 400A both motors
[2024-04-24T20:46:14] haku: nice
[2024-04-24T20:48:55] yoann tsobanoglou: We have not played with voltage, and we hear rfp had trouble going stable over 21s. But supposedly they can take burst current quite well. We have had spikes for phase amps reach 400a+ on the rear motor.
[2024-04-24T20:49:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: You can get up to 400a each
[2024-04-24T20:50:03] yoann tsobanoglou: And we are stable now with a bit less amps and a bit more watts
[2024-04-24T20:52:50] Yamal: without a doubt a good choice for a new future project, if it ever arrives, but I would like to be able to assemble anything, but with a minimum of 12 fet
[2024-04-24T20:55:07] Yamal: and I have the 22s in my sights too!! There are people with excellent results with 22s batteries! 22svs24s best option?
[2024-04-24T20:56:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: Omg motor temp
[2024-04-24T20:56:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_14655@24-04-2024_20-56-56.jpg>
[2024-04-24T20:56:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: 22s
[2024-04-24T20:57:21] Yamal: Why?
[2024-04-24T20:57:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because fasterüòÇ
[2024-04-24T20:57:48] Yamal: 100vüòé
[2024-04-24T20:57:56] yoann tsobanoglou: Speed motors ?
[2024-04-24T20:58:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: Better don't let controller work at it's limit
[2024-04-24T20:58:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2024-04-24T20:58:38] Chris Culver: If you need help lmk. I have a working display for vesc using lvgl
[2024-04-24T20:59:26] Yamal: Is it a problem for controllers that work up to 30s to do it at 24s?
[2024-04-24T21:00:03] Hurriicane: 24kw üò≤üò≤
[2024-04-24T21:00:46] Hurriicane: üò≤üò≤
[2024-04-24T21:01:01] Hurriicane: This is the first time I see such high wattage
[2024-04-24T21:01:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: No , but when you buy higher voltage controller it heats the twice
[2024-04-24T21:01:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: So you need bigger size if want same current capabilities
[2024-04-24T21:02:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: It's a lot yes
[2024-04-24T21:02:57] Hurriicane: <photos/photo_14656@24-04-2024_21-02-57.jpg>
[2024-04-24T21:03:17] Hurriicane: Pro 2 36v
[2024-04-24T21:03:33] Hurriicane: I will try it with 60v battery soon
[2024-04-24T21:03:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: The efficiency üòç
[2024-04-24T21:03:49] Hurriicane: Windings are not stock
[2024-04-24T21:04:20] Hurriicane: A thicker and different winding technique was used
[2024-04-24T21:04:30] Hurriicane: very efficient
[2024-04-24T21:05:28] yoann tsobanoglou: We are tuning a friends scooter, those speed motors reach crazy watts very easily. We are waiting for good weather to go get some more
[2024-04-24T21:06:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: Wow not bad
[2024-04-24T21:06:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: 40kmh average is crazy‚ò†
[2024-04-24T21:07:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: I would be arrested hahah
[2024-04-24T21:07:21] yoann tsobanoglou: This was with 71v
[2024-04-24T21:07:41] yoann tsobanoglou: They have a tunel that is only used by bus, and empty
[2024-04-24T21:08:05] Hurriicane: Motor?
[2024-04-24T21:08:15] yoann tsobanoglou: 70h speed motor
[2024-04-24T21:08:18] yoann tsobanoglou: Lonnyo

[2024-04-24T22:30:39] haku: this crazy for a standing scooter
[2024-04-24T23:00:32] haku: lonnyo motors are the only scooter motor brand that can do these high kw builds?

[2024-04-25T16:37:18] Jan: Vsett 10+
[2024-04-25T16:37:34] Jan: Yeah but at what cost?
[2024-04-25T16:38:49] Jan: This guy reached evem faster than 100kmh with poor steering geometry
[2024-04-25T16:39:11] Jan: <video_file>
[2024-04-25T16:39:47] Jan: It wasnt an "accident", it was poor shitty engineering
[2024-04-25T16:40:12] Jan: He was lucky and paid a small price
[2024-04-25T16:40:26] Jan: Another guy in france is dead now because of this issue
[2024-04-25T16:50:16] sombre_enfant: Yeah but we dont know wich scooter and wich circumstance yet...
[2024-04-25T16:54:20] Unknown: A little
[2024-04-25T16:56:20] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: What was the issue?
[2024-04-25T16:58:34] Yamal: For the moment g30 and gt2 the best geometry..?
[2024-04-25T16:59:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Without hat would be hard to tell , what's that even
[2024-04-25T16:59:37] sombre_enfant: Gt2 and inmotion g30 can wobble
[2024-04-25T17:00:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Missing mustache and too light blue eyes
[2024-04-25T17:03:45] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Segway Gt1/gt2 (gt3 in future maybe), segway st1/st2, inmotion rs, weped models big ones (sonic, sonic x), g30 with monorim and JREV fork for small models, nami blast
[2024-04-25T17:07:13] Yamal: Inmotion really good ? I can see normal geometry I don‚Äôt know ..
[2024-04-25T17:08:01] Yamal: I like to read WEPED üòàüòÇ

[2024-04-25T17:09:47] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Its good
[2024-04-25T17:10:31] Alin Ciobanu: Inmotion shit geometry
[2024-04-25T17:11:18] Unknown: Quality kaabo üòçüòú
[2024-04-25T17:11:44] Alin Ciobanu: Betulla boom üí•
[2024-04-25T17:14:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: Someone of our city said it wobbles very much
[2024-04-25T17:14:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: But honestly I don‚Äôt know if he can‚Äôt drive or just geometry is bad like more or less every C fork
[2024-04-25T17:14:55] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Inmotion rs?
[2024-04-25T17:15:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_14666@25-04-2024_17-15-16.jpg>
[2024-04-25T17:15:22] Jan: From Factory technically GT2 and Inmotion RS
[2024-04-25T17:15:25] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: It cant
[2024-04-25T17:15:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Then maybe his fault, I just heard what he told me. I never driven it
[2024-04-25T17:16:57] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: only if it weighs a lot and the suspension compresses very much, reducing the trail so much that it makes it hyper-maneuverable
[2024-04-25T17:19:47] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: another reason - a flat front tire and a square cst creates a square plane
[2024-04-25T17:19:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: The best geometry is something like vsett 11 fork , but the steering angle is no good. Otherwise it would be perfect
[2024-04-25T17:20:48] Alin Ciobanu: Alessandro, Ayoub both one and the other say he wobbles
[2024-04-25T17:21:12] Alin Ciobanu: Ha the junior PMT
[2024-04-25T17:21:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: I have to try üòÇ why they never ride with us
[2024-04-25T17:22:29] Alin Ciobanu: Actually, you never travel with us üòÇ
[2024-04-25T17:22:30] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Any videos? All videos, who ride it and reviews on youtube said opposite
[2024-04-25T17:22:44] Mirono escooters: Oh god that looks horrible
[2024-04-25T17:22:55] Alin Ciobanu: I won‚Äôt be there for a while üòî
[2024-04-25T17:23:04] Mirono escooters: Dude wasn't even steering and it wobbled
[2024-04-25T17:23:45] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: While braking
[2024-04-25T17:25:27] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Rs technically the frame and steering geometry cant wobble
[2024-04-25T17:26:27] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: unless the inmotion has disrupted the alignment of the wheels
[2024-04-25T17:26:45] Unknown: It also had a steering damper
[2024-04-25T17:28:15] Mirono escooters: Horrible
[2024-04-25T17:31:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: <video_file>
[2024-04-25T17:34:10] Unknown: Mezzica
[2024-04-25T17:43:30] Yamal: There is one thing I don't understand, is that good geometry is supposed to mean that the line of the mast coincides with the axis of the front wheel? it doesn't happen here
[2024-04-25T17:44:07] Yamal: Gt2 more near..
[2024-04-25T17:44:30] Yamal: I guess the smaller the angle, the better the geometry?

[2024-04-25T18:36:30] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: How does this happened?
[2024-04-25T18:48:11] Happy Giraffe: Death wobble?
[2024-04-25T18:49:26] Yamal: I think no
[2024-04-25T18:49:42] Yamal: This is French boy

[2024-04-25T18:52:40] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: You can see that he tried to brake the limits of the handling before knowing those limits
[2024-04-25T19:14:02] haku: Noname
[2024-04-25T19:17:49] haku: its a me mario.
[2024-04-25T19:31:02] haku: lot more choices guess where? ali baby
[2024-04-25T19:32:08] haku: that a wolf or vsett?
[2024-04-25T19:36:29] Yamal: Fidiko
[2024-04-25T19:40:50] haku: why was he wobbling before he crashed. its like he was doing it in purpouse
[2024-04-25T19:41:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: You will know it once your laotie finished bro
[2024-04-25T19:42:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: It's the main problem of no brand e scooter
[2024-04-25T19:42:33] puneDir: ƒ∞t happens so quickly
[2024-04-25T19:42:47] haku: is it okay to post parts for sale here?
[2024-04-25T19:42:50] puneDir: Starts like a bit gets worse and you're facing asphalt
[2024-04-25T19:43:40] puneDir: I had tank slapper with the zero (the time I finished the build and doing the first ride) I had at 78 it was so bad but thankfully i saved it (swiped around 2 lanes)
[2024-04-25T19:44:09] puneDir: Someone with less weight would fly away for sure
[2024-04-25T19:46:05] haku: fidiko is even better built than my laotie. i will not be doimg stupid speeds jeez. its a sanding scooter
[2024-04-25T19:48:44] haku: i will build it for slow cruising anf burnouts. slow enough for girls to see my good looks
[2024-04-25T19:53:30] Yamal: Do in g30 üòÅ, maybe is easy get in your city
[2024-04-25T19:54:06] Jan: Burnouts is more dependant on how shitty your tires are
[2024-04-25T19:54:12] haku: if all my parts can fit a g30 ill use that
[2024-04-25T19:54:44] Jan: Even a 10inch pmt will lift your 90kg ass into a wheelie when standing both feet at the neck
[2024-04-25T19:55:12] haku: im a fat 110kg
[2024-04-25T19:56:17] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Expensive tires
[2024-04-25T19:56:19] haku: honestly videos like this is the reason i prollong my build. i feel like im on a timer
[2024-04-25T19:58:30] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: For some scooters suspension it's better to bo fat (most of the rubber suspensions like dualtron or inokim ox)
[2024-04-25T19:58:57] puneDir: don't call him fat he will come and beat you up üòÑ
[2024-04-25T19:59:05] puneDir: He's like a bodyguard
[2024-04-25T19:59:33] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: So he is heavy not fat
[2024-04-25T19:59:43] puneDir: yes more like muscle man
[2024-04-25T19:59:52] haku: seriously im fat. im not kidding bur anyways back to laotie

[2024-04-25T20:01:09] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Can you change the front suspension to softer/harder one ?
[2024-04-25T20:01:12] puneDir: He's not like that
[2024-04-25T20:01:20] puneDir: He was sending deadlift vids lol
[2024-04-25T20:01:30] haku: nope. its cheap suspensions
[2024-04-25T20:01:41] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Offfff
[2024-04-25T20:01:54] puneDir: how tf i can mount my inrunner
[2024-04-25T20:02:01] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I don't like that you can't change nothing

[2024-04-25T20:02:32] puneDir: I dropped it from table lol

[2024-04-25T20:02:41] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: That's why I chose the zero10x over the inokim ox (I had both)

[2024-04-25T20:21:08] haku: lifestyle choices. i eat so much candy at night
[2024-04-25T20:21:32] haku: i need to quit that habbit
[2024-04-25T20:24:24] haku: and i never do cardio. i need to change that too
[2024-04-25T20:26:39] Jan: Never instantly quit sugar, or insulin production goes nuts and you could end with diabetes. Slowly reduce sugar
[2024-04-25T20:27:02] haku: agreed.
[2024-04-25T20:27:13] Jan: Sugar addiction is no joke, same struggles here
[2024-04-25T20:27:24] Jan: I need to reduce as well

[2024-04-25T22:09:40] NetworkDir: After changing to sensorless works better and without scary sounds
[2024-04-25T22:11:09] haku: give this guy a like and subscribe fellas. good stuff here
[2024-04-25T22:17:53] NetworkDir: Something like tiktiktik and spark
[2024-04-25T22:18:14] NetworkDir: Also on low speed sometimes power dropped and spark sound
[2024-04-25T22:18:37] NetworkDir: But on sensorless fine
[2024-04-25T22:38:35] haku: these kind of videos gives me an understanding how this stuff works. but i still have alot of learning what these components are
[2024-04-25T22:40:50] haku: i hope spintend sees this so they can improve on stuff
[2024-04-25T22:41:22] NetworkDir: But hall sensor mode is the best :D

[2024-04-26T05:52:07] haku: you can fit 9p i was told. not to sure
[2024-04-26T05:52:40] haku: big kid in the park has a gt2. almost running over other kids.

[2024-04-26T07:28:52] haku: if g30 can directly bolt on 11" ill be using that as daily scoot. those things built like tanks
[2024-04-26T07:29:28] haku: specially the snsc ninebots
[2024-04-26T07:30:47] rosheee: Spintends so their work as well^^
[2024-04-26T07:32:54] Yamal: The problem is that for large engines you have to modify the rear fork, right? in front with monorin it would be
[2024-04-26T07:36:34] Yamal: I've been thinking about it lately, using my 2 65h 33/2 motors in a g30 but the problem is that the speed motors would also need a 12 fet speed which translates to expensive...
[2024-04-26T07:37:17] rosheee: and some other custom work on the motor itself
[2024-04-26T07:37:25] Yamal: The g30 is not a problem, I have seen up to ‚Ç¨200 second-hand, in the end between battery and electronics it is expensive!üòÇ
[2024-04-26T07:38:51] Yamal: Do you have a photo of the rear fork with 65 h?
[2024-04-26T07:39:12] rosheee: stock rear fork
[2024-04-26T07:40:01] Yamal: interesting ...
[2024-04-26T07:40:57] Yamal: The truth is that I know little about g30 and I notice that there are several models,,? Which one is good to prepare?
[2024-04-26T07:41:10] sombre_enfant: He meant his 11" motor, it wont fit
[2024-04-26T07:41:32] rosheee: ah sorry
[2024-04-26T07:41:33] rosheee: xD
[2024-04-26T07:41:38] rosheee: 11" not fit rear
[2024-04-26T07:41:41] rosheee: but hold on
[2024-04-26T07:41:42] sombre_enfant: The classic size one not the White light model
[2024-04-26T07:42:23] sombre_enfant: Well it can with some sheet bending and welding job or with machined parts...
[2024-04-26T07:43:33] rosheee: <photos/photo_14681@26-04-2024_07-43-33.jpg>
[2024-04-26T07:43:53] Yamal: Blade ?
[2024-04-26T07:44:25] rosheee: g30 frame
[2024-04-26T07:44:31] rosheee: idk could be
[2024-04-26T07:44:33] rosheee: <photos/photo_14682@26-04-2024_07-44-33.jpg>
[2024-04-26T07:44:34] rosheee: or this
[2024-04-26T07:45:33] Yamal: 11‚Äù?
[2024-04-26T07:45:52] rosheee: idk but just as "inspiration"
[2024-04-26T07:46:08] sombre_enfant: Yeah blade rear braket and swingarm
[2024-04-26T07:46:15] rosheee: + damper
[2024-04-26T07:46:36] sombre_enfant: Nice but too much
[2024-04-26T07:59:07] Yamal: Is there any g3o for long routes?üòÅ
[2024-04-26T08:05:22] sombre_enfant: U just have to do two 10.5mm thick 120 lenght 65mm large alu plate, u do 10mm large pocket with r7/8 at the end 18mm lenght, 5mm deep off the 10.5mm thickness where u do the oblong 40x65 square and u good
[2024-04-26T08:11:43] Yamal: ü´°üëçü§ô
[2024-04-26T08:15:18] Yamal: performance packing tape
[2024-04-26T08:17:29] Yamal: Well, I'm freaking out these last few weeks with the Mijia, it's super stable!! I can see that good geometry in it.
[2024-04-26T08:18:29] Yamal: The g30 must already be crazy stable!!!
[2024-04-26T09:05:57] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Is something bent ? Looks like I'm riding on one side of the tire always

[2024-04-26T09:08:34] Yamal: 10x
[2024-04-26T09:09:12] Yamal: It seems so... unless you are constantly lying on that side
[2024-04-26T09:13:27] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Don't know how to fix
[2024-04-26T09:16:05] Yamal: I don't know, I would start by checking the swingarms, tightening them, checking the axle that is securely attached a little to make sure everything is okay.

[2024-04-26T15:45:14] sombre_enfant: 5kg seriously ?
[2024-04-26T16:00:45] Sto cazzo: Is this normal ?looks like my motor goes front and rear for a second sometimes when i accelerate
[2024-04-26T16:15:57] francois schempers: yup x)
[2024-04-26T16:24:52] sombre_enfant: Well alu was great enough
[2024-04-26T16:25:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: Why ?
[2024-04-26T16:31:46] Finn: You use foc or hall sensor
[2024-04-26T16:58:08] puneDir: Puneron got nicely welded
[2024-04-26T16:58:16] puneDir: Sand and paint time
[2024-04-26T17:07:45] francois schempers: Well well well, when I'm going 30, jumping curbs, if I miss my jump, since I'm 135kg, instead of bending and fucking up the plastic bottom plate, I fuck up the curb üòÇüòÇüòÇ

[2024-04-26T17:08:45] francois schempers: I'll allow it x)
[2024-04-26T17:08:54] Happy Giraffe: 5kg is your breakfast, tho 10kg inside rear hub motor feels heavyü§î 5kg next to floor might stabilize it actually lol
[2024-04-26T17:43:12] GABE: Basically 5% less efficient with that weight
[2024-04-26T17:44:01] Mirono escooters: Meh
[2024-04-26T17:50:59] sombre_enfant: Thats 5kg x 100kph more if u crash...
[2024-04-26T17:51:19] sombre_enfant: Yeah from rental stop stealing the scooter
[2024-04-26T17:51:34] Happy Giraffe: If crashing on scooter it gives better damage output to other road users
[2024-04-26T17:52:34] sombre_enfant: Yes sure
[2024-04-26T17:54:14] sombre_enfant: Ok send me

[2024-04-26T18:02:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, it was what I did exactly. I remind it was less than 1 month, and it was what you said: "I'm going on cruise for 1 month, you can ship when you want"

[2024-04-26T18:02:54] Unknown: You never shipped any motor to me
[2024-04-26T18:03:22] sombre_enfant: Man the point wasnt in how much debt u was, just let the rental scooter own yours.
[2024-04-26T18:03:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: Obviously, nobody will ship you anything if you take the money back

[2024-04-26T18:07:05] Happy Giraffe: And about the shipment/scamming threats better contact group owner if you got any serious issues with any group members. Its not healthy to banter here as we other dont know the full story.
[2024-04-26T18:25:46] francois schempers: yup this topic is closed, go private if you want to talk some more
[2024-04-26T18:29:23] francois schempers: less than that since the total me+scooter is more than 100kg and even 5% less of 12kw, you'll never gonna feel it
[2024-04-26T18:30:41] francois schempers: Well it lower the center of gravity, we will see if I can feel it, anyway, feels good to know the inside is safe, because that piece of plastic would have broken on impact
[2024-04-26T19:09:37] Sto cazzo: Yes should i switch to blcd?
[2024-04-26T19:10:51] Finn: Yes?

[2024-04-26T19:31:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: am i tripping? Watch video ,right side top 3 dot, go super slow and watch, it looks like reverse than forward Unsure what's happening
[2024-04-26T19:33:23] Happy Giraffe: Do Hall sensor calibration again and use sensored foc. Remember to have the switch from sensorless in rpm that is roughly 10kmh
[2024-04-26T19:39:46] haku: dam i wish im in eu. ss forks and dropouts sounds really good
[2024-04-26T19:41:45] Finn: I see it yes thats why i ask the question
[2024-04-26T19:42:04] Finn: On foc i could imagine that this happens at start. On hall it shouldnt be
[2024-04-26T19:43:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: For us yeah ,he supersized But i also told him that,he need to do bottom slides now
[2024-04-26T19:43:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You mean sensorless
[2024-04-26T19:43:46] Finn: Yes
[2024-04-26T19:43:58] Finn: Isnt foc the default option when going to sensorless?
[2024-04-26T19:44:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: That's where i could imagine,but that should be a shake and go forward,after told what is the forward
[2024-04-26T19:44:33] Finn: Tracking via backemf or smth
[2024-04-26T19:44:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If you go for it than yes
[2024-04-26T19:45:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Anyway his engine goes full throttle backword than forward,so should be more than this
[2024-04-26T19:56:45] Yamal: How much for the two 85/250?

[2024-04-26T21:12:07] Yamal: No, the board is fine, it's some component apparently so I'm not going to wait this weekend to see how it goes, I can consider buying spintend 85/250
[2024-04-26T21:13:38] haku: nami frame is cool imo. but thunder is cool too.
[2024-04-26T21:14:13] Yamal: Just with Nami frame no very good lucküòÖ
[2024-04-26T21:14:37] haku: its just bad electronics. nothing wrong with frame

[2024-04-29T15:13:52] haku: bigger sprocket?
[2024-04-29T15:14:31] puneDir: No i want insane torque:D
[2024-04-29T15:44:15] Unknown: You need straight line from sprocket to sprocket. Especially with insane torque. Why can't you move motor up?

[2024-04-29T15:54:09] Unknown: If the red was a plate with a Jack shaft double sprocket. You could raise the chain. Otherwise a janky fix is under swingarm over top sprocket on Jack shaft and to wheel. Making a square shape but not a lot of sprocket engagement.

[2024-04-29T19:20:46] GABE: but electric doesn't have that cause it would shred it
[2024-04-29T19:20:52] GABE: But gearbox gives the noise
[2024-04-29T19:21:07] GABE: so that's why it sounds like RC

[2024-04-29T23:05:54] haku: when you run these motors at 10-15kw ea. do these motors get really hot?
[2024-04-29T23:06:14] sombre_enfant: Yeah just look the race vid.
[2024-04-29T23:06:54] NetworkDir: This rated wattage looks for 3900W 24/7 work without any problem
[2024-04-29T23:06:54] sombre_enfant: And its 10-15min...u can actually easily blow them with a vesc function i dont remember the name...
[2024-04-29T23:07:00] NetworkDir: But you can push 15kW for 10min
[2024-04-29T23:07:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: forge the tape

[2024-04-30T01:57:07] GABE: It'll come cheaper than getting extra baggage at the airport and sending the cell separately
[2024-04-30T04:20:55] haku: to the guys that have stock vsett display. is the odometer accurate? i know i ride mine alot but it shows just a few miles in the odometer
[2024-04-30T04:22:25] Unknown: Out the box, no. Set tire Dia in P settings and match your speed with GPS on phone
[2024-04-30T04:22:56] Unknown: That's how they get the claimed top speed.

[2024-04-30T11:09:22] haku: p42 40t or vtc 21700 like what james said
[2024-04-30T11:30:38] Yamal: To set the correct speed in the vesc tool application, where did you touch it? to know more or less the average speeds I have...

[2024-04-30T12:00:41] Happy Giraffe: Smartbms and button to control bms output?
[2024-04-30T12:02:16] Happy Giraffe: Have a separate gps app on your phone simultaniously as overlay. Then use "direct drive" on vesctool and change tire size until the gps meter and vesc app show roughly same speed
[2024-04-30T12:02:59] Happy Giraffe: After roughly same speed is achieved then you can use vesc logs on PC to compare speedometer vs gps and finetune it to be super accurate
[2024-04-30T12:04:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: Just put 1 is the same , no need of new configuration

[2024-04-30T12:26:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: I thought 1500 :/
[2024-04-30T12:33:24] Yamal: Ready thanks
[2024-04-30T12:47:38] Happy Giraffe: Its correct when vesctool display matches your gps appüòÇ
[2024-04-30T12:48:10] Happy Giraffe: You will still need a chain guide and tensioner I think
[2024-04-30T12:48:49] Happy Giraffe: Also when rear shock compresses the position of chain will change in relation to part welded to frame
[2024-04-30T12:52:59] puneDir: No need
[2024-04-30T12:53:02] puneDir: Tested it's ok
[2024-04-30T13:08:35] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-04-30T13:08:50] puneDir: Chain is loose ik i haven't adjusted yet
[2024-04-30T13:24:06] Rogerio Figueiredo: No I want a button to turn off the esc since this esc has shutdown function
[2024-04-30T13:26:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Try when sus is on max movement,under your weight
[2024-04-30T13:28:25] puneDir: I did
[2024-04-30T13:28:34] Mirono escooters: You move quickly
[2024-04-30T13:28:35] puneDir: Mounted the camera and jumped on the frame lol
[2024-04-30T13:28:54] puneDir: ƒ∞t's shit for now cuz i haven't mounted properly yey
[2024-04-30T14:06:20] Rogerio Figueiredo: That ender 3 frame should be great now after that weight on it üòÇ üòÇ
[2024-04-30T14:16:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Coz main force point is moved , that's why handlebar moves a lot in your hand ,all of broken g30 neck i saw had sharset
[2024-04-30T14:18:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: They said there is no grip on the brake , probably oil leaked ü´°ü´£üòÖ
[2024-04-30T14:18:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: fully paid ,so fully usedüôà
[2024-04-30T14:19:02] Happy Giraffe: Why wouldnt they just spend the extra 1‚Ç¨ and make the critical parts of frame 0.5mm thickerüåö
[2024-04-30T14:19:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Frame not ment for this , that's other thing
[2024-04-30T14:20:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also working suspension doesnt end up with moving the handlebar like that in your hand
[2024-04-30T14:24:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: From this side of the story yes
[2024-04-30T14:24:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But mirrored forks
[2024-04-30T14:24:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If you have one
[2024-04-30T14:24:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Shark
[2024-04-30T14:25:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Get a mate on it and let him move sus standing
[2024-04-30T14:25:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Or you can try
[2024-04-30T14:26:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If you have side video of this you can see this partly
[2024-04-30T14:28:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Even there own axle bends, look at main one from behind or from bottom side where the two big Bearings are ,it has a V shape after x usage
[2024-04-30T14:28:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And if you have a video look at handlebar movent
[2024-04-30T14:29:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Than look at sus when it bottoms out

[2024-04-30T17:22:58] GABE: Put balls in there
[2024-04-30T17:39:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: ? What's that?
[2024-04-30T17:46:37] haku: looks like usbc covers
[2024-04-30T18:03:53] Yamal: If they are rubber plugs for port C, since I have the electronics so exposed, I actually have to invent the esc that I missed, the port goes forward, this time the 2 will go to the back and the battery cables to the front
[2024-04-30T19:00:36] NetworkDir: New tires coming soon
[2024-04-30T19:07:58] NetworkDir: yeah

[2024-04-30T19:10:34] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. NetworkDir has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-04-30T19:40:15] Yamal: Before there was a good video that showed images of the welding of the frame, I don't see it...üò©

[2024-04-30T20:54:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: M26 are the worst cell existing for power applications
[2024-04-30T20:54:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: It result worse even than Chinese cells
[2024-04-30T20:57:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: i dont know how they can rate it for 10a if the resistance is 3 times worse than 50e
[2024-04-30T21:03:45] Happy Giraffe: Or plan and slowly build bike for 6 months while saving up for proper cells in the meantime
[2024-04-30T21:04:34] Happy Giraffe: I do same with my bike, not skipping on any component but building and planning it slow. No regrets

[2024-04-30T21:32:22] Yamal: There is no contraband moli?

[2024-05-01T14:07:49] GABE: is a seat hyper unstable always? I wanna use one, If you aren't an idiot then you will hardly lose control that easily?
[2024-05-01T14:08:07] GABE: I see people on scooters with seats all the time. having the seat as low as possible would help too?
[2024-05-01T14:17:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: All Depends on what you are doing
[2024-05-01T14:19:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Slow calm ride,just long is doable ,mostly these are foldable also ,so you rely on one bolt whats like on the mantis neck

[2024-05-01T16:32:34] Mirono escooters: Keep enable means always on
[2024-05-01T16:36:48] Happy Giraffe: Just be careful with the chain as when shock gets an impact it will hit the frame
[2024-05-01T16:43:22] puneDir: I tried it's good
[2024-05-01T16:43:29] puneDir: I'm gonna put 73 sprocket
[2024-05-01T16:44:57] Yamal: Moto ‚ÄºÔ∏è
[2024-05-01T17:32:25] puneDir: I took a ride
[2024-05-01T17:32:31] puneDir: 0-30 is so slow
[2024-05-01T17:32:37] puneDir: After 50 it flies lol (with 50a)
[2024-05-01T17:34:01] puneDir: I Maded 90 (with zeros battery and esc) but it needs bigger rear sprocket Also 84100 doesn't dies with cutoff (my xt60 got disconnected 3 times while going 50 ish) so it's safe to say you can have cutoffs with it
[2024-05-01T17:39:38] puneDir: I stole zeros part to test this lol But it's nice
[2024-05-01T17:39:38] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. puneDir has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-05-01T18:16:10] puneDir: Yeah XD
[2024-05-01T18:16:27] puneDir: That wrapped zero battery looks like illegal stuff
[2024-05-01T18:16:46] puneDir: I'm impressed how it goes with 50a
[2024-05-01T18:16:53] puneDir: 200 should be more than enough

[2024-05-01T19:29:38] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: Hello, I have been following the group for a while and I decided to try the Vesc controllers. I have a Ubox 100/100 controller installed on a dualtron thunder, the motor detection is correct but I can't get the Spin-Y2 accelerator to work. Following the instructions I have connected it to 5v, gnd and adc1, a green LED lights up and when you accelerate a red LED lights up inside the accelerator. I have tried the accelerator detection but it doesn't seem to detect it. Have I skipped any steps to make it work?
[2024-05-01T20:07:20] NetworkDir: Yeah
[2024-05-01T20:07:51] NetworkDir: But thunder is friend
[2024-05-01T20:07:59] Yamal: Zero faster?
[2024-05-01T20:08:06] puneDir: For sure
[2024-05-01T20:08:20] puneDir: I'm going to add 20s5p to my zero
[2024-05-01T20:08:29] puneDir: actually i can even add 20s8p
[2024-05-01T20:15:58] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-05-01T20:16:53] haku: the ultimate battery would be 22s 22p. p42 big dick battery
[2024-05-01T20:19:10] Yamal: For your escooter ?
[2024-05-01T20:20:36] Yamal: for the car fan, which seems to be pushing the heat

[2024-05-01T20:26:16] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: I had the port connected to the escA, I have connected it to the adc1 connector of the escB and now it detects the throttle voltage correctly but it does not accelerate the motors
[2024-05-01T20:29:52] haku: maybe. or a future project for sometging seated
[2024-05-01T20:30:35] haku: i have 490 p42 cells coming. thinking of ways to use it
[2024-05-01T20:30:46] Yamal: Thunder 2 look always nice!
[2024-05-01T20:33:19] haku: i know this theater. its in red rock las vegas haha
[2024-05-01T20:34:06] haku: and yes alot of shit like this where im from haha
[2024-05-01T20:35:06] Yamal: Zero is the nightmare of thunder, cry thunder cry, vesc performace is here to make you dance
[2024-05-01T20:49:34] Happy Giraffe: That's like 2 grand lol
[2024-05-01T20:50:16] haku: nope.
[2024-05-01T21:06:39] NetworkDir: I love my scooter stem problem looks fixed Just 2 problems i see : unstable tires (i purchased bigger one and coming soon should received) And throttle noise (sometimes scooter press throttle and try kill me but i use 40% acceleration with profile and fine)

[2024-05-01T21:19:25] haku: is bruce lee under there?
[2024-05-01T21:19:41] puneDir: PuneRon is making 270kmh on air
[2024-05-01T21:19:47] puneDir: With 13-48
[2024-05-01T21:19:58] puneDir: I need 73 rear sprocket
[2024-05-01T21:20:06] haku: shredded beef.
[2024-05-01T21:20:31] Happy Giraffe: Did you account the motor internal reduction?
[2024-05-01T21:20:48] puneDir: It doesn't have that i guess
[2024-05-01T21:20:57] puneDir: Wheel speed is 270 kmh
[2024-05-01T21:20:59] Happy Giraffe: All IPMs usually have
[2024-05-01T21:21:05] puneDir: How to use it
[2024-05-01T21:21:35] Happy Giraffe: If you dont know the exact value you would have to calculate it by turning motor by hand
[2024-05-01T21:21:49] puneDir: <photos/photo_14788@01-05-2024_21-21-49.jpg>
[2024-05-01T21:21:49] Mirono escooters: That's quite the gear ratio
[2024-05-01T21:21:56] puneDir: 270 on air
[2024-05-01T21:21:59] Mirono escooters: 2Nm
[2024-05-01T21:22:03] puneDir: I need bigger rear sprocket
[2024-05-01T21:22:08] puneDir: Actually it's quite ok lol
[2024-05-01T21:22:12] puneDir: I liked the torque
[2024-05-01T21:22:19] puneDir: Hitted 90 somehow
[2024-05-01T21:22:22] Happy Giraffe: Would require opening motor to see how many motor turns is required to spin output shaft once
[2024-05-01T21:22:40] Mirono escooters: Ipm have internal gear reduction?
[2024-05-01T21:22:43] Mirono escooters: First time hearing that
[2024-05-01T21:22:46] puneDir: If youre wondering motor have 8 magnets
[2024-05-01T21:22:47] Happy Giraffe: Or just use wheel size and fk it
[2024-05-01T21:22:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: That's for sure,rest need to be asked from them if non wired one like this
[2024-05-01T21:23:00] Happy Giraffe: Bbshd surely has in example

[2024-05-01T21:24:09] puneDir: This motor is insane It can climb and go fast with 270kmh on air ratio
[2024-05-01T21:24:31] Mirono escooters: ain't hitting 270
[2024-05-01T21:24:51] puneDir: ƒ∞t's making 270 on air but i guess it can do 160 on road lol
[2024-05-01T21:25:00] Happy Giraffe: In example this gear connects the large diameter gear and the output shaft
[2024-05-01T21:25:05] puneDir: Did 90 today and it was still going (Just 50a discharge)
[2024-05-01T21:25:24] puneDir: It doesn't have that i believe
[2024-05-01T21:25:38] puneDir: Why using bigger rear sprocket is a bad idea
[2024-05-01T21:25:38] Happy Giraffe: Seems this motor doesnt have it
[2024-05-01T21:25:46] puneDir: Maybe 130
[2024-05-01T21:26:10] puneDir: I did 90 today (rear wheel and front caliper is holded by rust and hopes / dreams)

[2024-05-01T21:27:30] puneDir: So I can slap 80t sprocket and add fwk?

[2024-05-01T21:31:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also a bunch of ppl has this throttle, i only saw first version irl
[2024-05-01T21:31:52] Happy Giraffe: Kinda but I would gear it in a way that your typical cruise speed won't need fw
[2024-05-01T21:32:19] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: I'm going to look at Spinted's instructions again, at first it didn't indicate any configuration, just connecting the physical cables.
[2024-05-01T21:32:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Better read all possible before
[2024-05-01T21:32:48] puneDir: With 73t i can still be able to hit 120
[2024-05-01T21:33:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Vesc likes to die coz bad configs and such
[2024-05-01T21:33:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Maybe @jamessoderstrom more familar with the throttle or maybe @koxx3 or @SibClimb
[2024-05-01T21:35:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And its not a reverse bolt?
[2024-05-01T21:35:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also its an old ass self setting brake

[2024-05-01T21:38:51] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: In the instructions it indicates that it can be connected to 5v or 3.3v, I will try 5v to see if it works.
[2024-05-01T21:45:53] puneDir: Local market

[2024-05-02T18:51:49] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/eVMTsp1aUcg?si=kzUgX9rRQULNRVu3
[2024-05-02T18:57:17] GABE: Such a shame that these lithium cells are just thrown like that.
[2024-05-02T18:57:44] GABE: This is why lithium prices are so shit
[2024-05-02T18:59:35] GABE: Could make some very nice high discharge cells with the lithium material in these, lithium should be more controlled, it's too finite.
[2024-05-02T19:11:50] Happy Giraffe: Lithium got "Lost" I guess, bwahahaüåö
[2024-05-02T19:41:40] Mirono escooters: Its getting phased out
[2024-05-02T19:41:47] Mirono escooters: But they are easily removable. I got a bunch
[2024-05-02T19:41:52] Mirono escooters: The big ones got nice lipo inside
[2024-05-02T19:43:31] Happy Giraffe: Perfect for homemade 20s2p bomb
[2024-05-02T19:43:43] Mirono escooters: XD
[2024-05-02T19:43:53] Mirono escooters: A powerbank or so
[2024-05-02T19:44:01] Mirono escooters: Id do it if I had access to them
[2024-05-02T19:44:03] Happy Giraffe: You have no idea how tempting this is...
[2024-05-02T19:45:38] Happy Giraffe: Now that Creality crap failed on me for the 10th time
[2024-05-02T19:46:03] Mirono escooters: Again? What failed now
[2024-05-02T19:46:22] Mirono escooters: Huh 13‚Ç¨ with hotend? Does it got the electronics?
[2024-05-02T19:46:50] Mirono escooters: Go klipper, away with stock crap
[2024-05-02T19:47:05] Happy Giraffe: Heatblock design is flawed and doesnt work properly with good nozzle. Works ok with supplied 0.4mm brass nozzles but those are boring
[2024-05-02T19:47:12] Happy Giraffe: I have pro marlin cfw
[2024-05-02T19:47:39] Happy Giraffe: Im propably selling this for 150e lmao, such a good investment
[2024-05-02T19:49:28] GABE: they are on the floor EVERYWHERE
[2024-05-02T19:50:11] Mirono escooters: UK moment
[2024-05-02T19:50:24] Mirono escooters: I offer u 50
[2024-05-02T19:50:34] Mirono escooters: You use original hotend? Lame
[2024-05-02T19:50:35] Mirono escooters: : D
[2024-05-02T19:56:25] puneDir: Today i maded 25 km with puneron
[2024-05-02T19:56:33] puneDir: With around 70
[2024-05-02T19:56:36] puneDir: Just to test frame
[2024-05-02T20:06:35] Happy Giraffe: Friend is thinking for 150‚Ç¨ üòÅ
[2024-05-02T20:20:35] Happy Giraffe: It was a 600e printer, back in the day when there was no competition, atleast its 300x300x300
[2024-05-02T20:30:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: Who cares about leaning a so damn slow scooter ?
[2024-05-02T20:31:58] haku: do it. no regerts here
[2024-05-02T20:33:53] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Install low budget tyres on it, and it will not longer lean like that. Pmt is already enough for any leaning you can ever get
[2024-05-02T20:47:36] haku: i wonder why they did not go with 22s
[2024-05-02T20:48:41] haku: ive heard these things are 48v. such a big deck for all that batteries
[2024-05-02T20:53:15] haku: i want to 3d print something similar on my laotie if i learn cad lol
[2024-05-02T20:54:56] haku: would be funny if it was a laotie underneath all that mold haha
[2024-05-02T21:05:33] haku: look what i found in my medicine cabinet. i forgot i have this.

[2024-05-02T21:10:46] GABE: Time to celebrate!!
[2024-05-02T21:11:32] Mirono escooters: 800mg thc? XD
[2024-05-02T21:11:46] GABE: about 8 nice joints.
[2024-05-02T21:11:53] GABE: equate
[2024-05-02T21:12:29] GABE: I just got a bag of weed just there
[2024-05-02T21:12:31] haku: i threw it in the trash. that from 5yrs ago
[2024-05-02T21:12:37] GABE: Its fine
[2024-05-02T21:12:41] GABE: you can still use it
[2024-05-02T21:12:45] GABE: it's just 60% less potent
[2024-05-02T21:12:53] GABE: dont throw dat shit
[2024-05-02T21:13:01] haku: the top is leaking. my son might find it
[2024-05-02T21:13:10] GABE: Take a spoon full
[2024-05-02T21:13:12] GABE: in your tea
[2024-05-02T21:13:16] GABE: then throw it out if you want
[2024-05-02T21:13:21] GABE: but please don't let that go to waste
[2024-05-02T21:14:59] haku: this stuff is plentyful in the land of the free.
[2024-05-02T21:15:55] haku: i just touched the leak and felt it already.
[2024-05-02T21:16:39] puneDir: funny shit
[2024-05-02T21:18:02] haku: can you microdose thc?
[2024-05-02T21:23:25] Jacob: Yeah ofcourse
[2024-05-02T21:56:20] sombre_enfant: U have a son big man stop chasin the high its too late for that get another woman
[2024-05-02T21:58:03] haku: women expensive nowadays.
[2024-05-02T21:59:00] haku: honestly i dont have a good reaction with thc. maybe my brain built different
[2024-05-02T21:59:54] haku: or any drug for that matter. i dont even drinküò≠. just the usual xanax as needed
[2024-05-02T22:09:16] haku: i also take kratom after a hard workout. idk if you guys know what that is
[2024-05-02T22:10:13] sombre_enfant: Usual xanax? Dawg wtf
[2024-05-02T22:11:34] haku: prescription bro.
[2024-05-02T22:11:48] haku: i have "anxiety"
[2024-05-02T22:15:10] Rose: Hey there Newname, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-05-02T22:15:14] Rose: Hey there Newname, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-05-02T22:17:15] haku: hey you sound familiar. are you that fbi informant?
[2024-05-02T22:18:07] Noname: Na I got a new phone number.
[2024-05-02T22:18:30] haku: i was wondering where you went
[2024-05-02T22:20:39] haku: i was sad ngl. only one who talks to me in american time
[2024-05-02T22:20:49] Noname: My bank card got hacked so I swapped my stuff as a precaution. Didn't know you could add a new number here first
[2024-05-02T22:21:08] Noname: Sucks I lost battery chat right?
[2024-05-02T22:21:21] GABE: Yeah
[2024-05-02T22:21:34] GABE: Plant heroin
[2024-05-02T22:26:03] haku: is it really?
[2024-05-02T22:26:27] haku: thats the only one that helps me with muscle pain
[2024-05-02T22:26:59] GABE: Yeah it's an actual opioid
[2024-05-02T22:27:10] GABE: you can use it to get off heroin
[2024-05-02T22:27:14] haku: i see.
[2024-05-02T22:28:01] haku: its better than the oxy i was prescribed when i was younger.
[2024-05-02T22:28:27] haku: when i use to compete i had to take these
[2024-05-02T22:39:41] sombre_enfant: Fuck ts bro
[2024-05-02T22:41:26] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-05-02T22:42:41] puneDir: Went out to test frame and gear ratio
[2024-05-02T22:42:47] puneDir: Gear ratio is shit
[2024-05-02T22:53:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Hello. I have the following issue: Configured 200A and 400A ABS (375A is the hardware limit - that's what BRK stands for) Can I somehow keep it below 375A while keeping it at 200A motor current...
[2024-05-02T22:53:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <photos/photo_14806@02-05-2024_22-53-34.jpg>
[2024-05-02T23:13:12] haku: https://youtu.be/fO4E-SH-mEM?si=LqrYROJsxfJjvM3C Chris have these guys build you a pack.
[2024-05-02T23:14:02] haku: i wonder if they weld copper
[2024-05-02T23:14:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I will set my maximum current below 375A next, this already helps to not trigger BRK and having no power until reboot. But does not solve the actual issue on why it peaks so high in the first place.
[2024-05-02T23:15:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I know this issue from my experience with the 75100 Alu, easily triggering 190A ABS with only 135A... Slow ABS helps with this, because 75100 does not have any hardware over-current protection. But MP2 does ... üò¨ (my v0.5 is faulty, it is limited to 375A - v0.6 has 430A as its supposed to be)
[2024-05-02T23:25:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: https://youtube.com/shorts/BYpqmwwDk_8?si=xbGXvHQEE5MDxLQ9 Little tough guyüòÅ
[2024-05-02T23:27:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Seems VESC Log does not show spikes.
[2024-05-02T23:27:32] haku: i want to build one for my kid. these little ebikes are expensive
[2024-05-02T23:28:41] haku: kid is badass
[2024-05-02T23:29:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yeah
[2024-05-02T23:31:01] haku: g30 motor will fit his bike but need to strech the dropouts
[2024-05-02T23:32:23] GABE: expensive trash
[2024-05-02T23:32:53] GABE: it's geared down pretty hard.
[2024-05-02T23:32:54] haku: the problem is it will outgrow him in a year and then its trash
[2024-05-02T23:33:29] GABE: your kid live with you ?
[2024-05-02T23:33:40] haku: half of the week yes.
[2024-05-02T23:33:54] GABE: ah its the tug of war situation?
[2024-05-02T23:34:34] haku: nah not anymore.
[2024-05-02T23:35:00] haku: good for him he just had 2 birthday parties. one from me and one from his mom
[2024-05-02T23:47:31] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes noticed. I would need to replicate this and do sampled data.
[2024-05-02T23:47:40] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But honestly... I dont want to üòÇ
[2024-05-02T23:48:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Nope I do not have one. And I forgot to record with GoPro too (forgot to hit button or smth?)
[2024-05-02T23:49:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But I might try changing "Current Sample Mode" to "High Current" and disabling BEMF because it says: "Back EMF decoupling on the Q axis is enabled. This improves performance significantly if the motor speed changes rapidly, but makes the current controller depend on the speed tracker."
[2024-05-02T23:49:27] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 60H 22x3
[2024-05-02T23:49:30] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 73
[2024-05-02T23:49:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: going faster is no problem but this time full throttle it was... yeah
[2024-05-02T23:50:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It stayed "at 200A" motor current until the fault. (at least the log says it)
[2024-05-02T23:50:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Is it new?
[2024-05-02T23:50:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <photos/photo_14809@02-05-2024_23-50-55.jpg>
[2024-05-02T23:50:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Aight.
[2024-05-02T23:52:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I will try. So V0 only?
[2024-05-02T23:52:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: And control sample mode? High Current?
[2024-05-02T23:53:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Ok that's what I am currently using.
[2024-05-02T23:54:07] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: What about BEMF? Should I disable it?
[2024-05-02T23:54:11] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I don't even know what it does üòÇ
[2024-05-02T23:54:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But since it says: "This improves performance significantly if the motor speed changes rapidly, but makes the current controller depend on the speed tracker." I feel like this might cause issues?
[2024-05-02T23:55:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Ok tomorrow I will try again and hopefully not fall of the scooter when fault kicks üòÇ
[2024-05-02T23:55:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: And I will look if I can somehow sample data.
[2024-05-03T00:00:18] sombre_enfant: Damn Roger bullshit
[2024-05-03T05:55:08] haku: do you guys know if i need to reapply thermal paste with this temps? or is this normal?
[2024-05-03T06:01:13] haku: its gets so slow when i slice in bambu software
[2024-05-03T06:11:01] NetworkDir: It's on idle or after/when using
[2024-05-03T06:11:43] NetworkDir: 46C for gpu fine 76C for cpu looks good
[2024-05-03T06:12:01] NetworkDir: No problem when > 100C
[2024-05-03T06:18:57] haku: gotcha. its when slicing in bambu. i think it might be the bambu software is the problem or my cpu too slow
[2024-05-03T06:30:03] NetworkDir: Maybe you need to NVME :D
[2024-05-03T06:30:27] NetworkDir: Monitor when using bambu (With task manager)
[2024-05-03T06:34:40] haku: nvme is memory yea? its been a while since i built this
[2024-05-03T07:01:20] haku: sorry i mean ssd?
[2024-05-03T07:18:15] Chris Culver: I wonder if they weld silver
[2024-05-03T07:23:54] Chris Culver: Yes
[2024-05-03T07:24:17] haku: ask hehe
[2024-05-03T07:25:14] Chris Culver: How can you use a key to turn off and on a 84100?
[2024-05-03T09:01:32] Happy Giraffe: One thing you missed is some gpus have fanspeed set to 0% until certain temperature is reached. Also if the fans spin very slow its ok to have 45-50c temps as pc is basically silent then when workingüëç
[2024-05-03T09:02:33] Happy Giraffe: Your cpu also can slice propably 20 models at the same time without slowing down at all
[2024-05-03T09:03:03] NetworkDir: Ryzen multithreading üî•‚ò†Ô∏è
[2024-05-03T09:03:18] Happy Giraffe: Just bad optimization in Fusion and Slicers to use full potential of hardware
[2024-05-03T09:03:40] Happy Giraffe: Haha, yes all cores overclocked to stock single core boostüî•
[2024-05-03T09:04:10] haku: not at all its really slow slicing stuff
[2024-05-03T09:04:27] Happy Giraffe: Check cpu usage at task manager
[2024-05-03T09:04:33] Happy Giraffe: Probably like 5%
[2024-05-03T09:07:39] haku: this is old ryzen ive heard the new ones way better. but i would need a new motherboard i think

[2024-05-03T09:23:16] Happy Giraffe: You are merely using any of its performance, would just waste your money on new one. Would be even more performance unused than now
[2024-05-03T09:25:23] Konstantin: Easy
[2024-05-03T09:25:29] Konstantin: Like this xD
[2024-05-03T09:25:38] Konstantin: <video_file>
[2024-05-03T09:26:49] Konstantin: Button + easy turn motor, all works
[2024-05-03T09:45:49] Konstantin: Probably can, but need test it. If on vesc tool set always off... But at the moment I'm don't need it

[2024-05-03T21:30:21] GABE: is it Ur scooter
[2024-05-03T21:30:35] GABE: would you know the wattage specs etc?
[2024-05-03T21:30:40] GABE: I saw it was going 140
[2024-05-03T21:31:07] Yamal: The winding is not known, there are people who say that they are speed but it is not like that, the winding is only known by the by Numo,,
[2024-05-03T21:31:34] GABE: If it's 20s then it must be a speed winded motor
[2024-05-03T21:31:44] GABE: cause 75h can't be that fast at 22x3
[2024-05-03T21:31:46] GABE: must be 33x2
[2024-05-03T21:33:01] Yamal: They themselves state that they are not 33/2, in fact they do not talk about their engines...
[2024-05-03T21:33:34] GABE: can't imagine gatekeeping a hunk of copper
[2024-05-03T21:34:16] GABE: no way its going 140 without fwk. that's crazy
[2024-05-03T21:34:31] GABE: must be like 500a batt for this setup to work with a torque motor.
[2024-05-03T21:34:59] haku: 70h i love china motors im sure
[2024-05-03T21:38:07] GABE: they must be lying about it not being 33x2
[2024-05-03T21:38:23] GABE: that's 2 turn right?
[2024-05-03T21:38:41] GABE: what does the 33 mean? the amount of arrays of 2 winds?
[2024-05-03T21:38:49] GABE: so 33 sets of 2 winds?
[2024-05-03T21:38:54] GABE: in a circle?
[2024-05-03T21:40:00] GABE: yeah makes sense I couldn't believe a 2T motor to not burn. For RC I was used to it being 1 parallel wire 2 turns lol
[2024-05-03T21:40:25] GABE: Like a 7t motor was 7 loops on each thing
[2024-05-03T21:40:30] GABE: not 33x7
[2024-05-03T21:40:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: And meüòè
[2024-05-03T21:41:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: Anyway yes is 33x2

[2024-05-03T21:41:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is 75h
[2024-05-03T21:41:57] GABE: I can't imagine how much dat shit weighs
[2024-05-03T21:42:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: Specs are almost the same, only difference is design
[2024-05-03T21:42:27] haku: is it a big difference in 70h vs 75h vs 80h?
[2024-05-03T21:42:44] haku: if all are 33x2
[2024-05-03T21:44:51] GABE: <photos/photo_14815@03-05-2024_21-44-51.jpg>
[2024-05-03T21:44:57] GABE: micro motor
[2024-05-03T21:49:09] Yamal: Are they 33/2? special? How is it possible that they have torque? a lot of torque and tip? with 7218
[2024-05-03T21:49:35] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-05-03T21:53:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: there‚Äôs not very much torque as their test video looks like
[2024-05-03T21:53:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: Performance was same as 7218 with 75h of ly
[2024-05-03T21:54:46] GABE: Must be a hybrid wind
[2024-05-03T21:54:58] GABE: or different gauge copper
[2024-05-03T21:55:14] haku: winded with silver
[2024-05-03T21:55:29] GABE: Wouldn't be too expensive too
[2024-05-03T21:55:55] GABE: only like 5%+ efficiency
[2024-05-03T21:56:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: Why overthink üòÇ
[2024-05-03T21:56:21] GABE: I have anxiety my entire life is overthinking
[2024-05-03T21:56:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs super normal 75h 33x2
[2024-05-03T21:56:57] haku: is it made by ly just like all the other motors?
[2024-05-03T21:59:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Different factory
[2024-05-03T22:00:48] GABE: my dream is to be a motor factory worker
[2024-05-03T22:03:07] haku: dream of owning that factory bud
[2024-05-03T22:04:44] GABE: is LY a public company?
[2024-05-03T22:04:59] GABE: thats something I'd actually invest in

[2024-05-03T22:10:37] Yamal: <sticker>

[2024-05-03T23:02:57] Yamal: Don't worry, Paolo, there is freedom of expression, you can talk and comment on things, and that's how you learn, by sharing, In fact, when you put different stones of different shapes and colors in a dry pumpkin with water and start shaking for a while, in the end all the stones end up with the same shape but each one with its own characteristic color.

[2024-05-04T20:51:27] JPPL: I still have my 7230+7218 Kelly setup ready to mount in some box
[2024-05-04T20:53:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: Exist also Kelly with field weakening
[2024-05-04T20:53:54] haku: they are very reliable. like old sabvotons
[2024-05-04T21:03:06] haku: you can prolly do that with those. inwas thinking of the same thing. what a waste

[2024-05-04T22:01:10] NetworkDir: looks holderless possible 7p but dangerous
[2024-05-04T22:01:11] haku: yes. very complicated layout.
[2024-05-04T22:01:26] haku: looks good
[2024-05-04T22:01:35] puneDir: actually imma drill the motor
[2024-05-04T22:01:41] puneDir: and just watercool it
[2024-05-04T22:02:17] haku: does your motor overheat?
[2024-05-04T22:02:58] puneDir: not much but
[2024-05-04T22:02:59] puneDir: funny

[2024-05-04T22:34:04] GABE: with a honeycomb fish paper layout
[2024-05-04T23:34:22] R3VOLT: Should the momentary button that Spintend sends in every package be off even if u plugged battery in
[2024-05-04T23:34:45] R3VOLT: Or is it just gonna lit if any issues
[2024-05-04T23:35:29] R3VOLT: I ve plugged battery in and i can t see any leds on either the vesc or button

[2024-05-04T23:50:28] haku: how does it perform on single motor?
[2024-05-04T23:50:53] haku: did you have it rear or front drive?
[2024-05-04T23:53:53] Yamal: Single front green little Focer attack

[2024-05-05T01:19:26] NetworkDir: Correct mounting and thermal paste important
[2024-05-05T01:20:18] Yamal: Tronic 250, only use 1 ..
[2024-05-05T01:20:52] NetworkDir: Looks your mounting wrong
[2024-05-05T01:20:56] NetworkDir: Ah
[2024-05-05T01:21:06] NetworkDir: You use single drive Sure

[2024-05-05T14:48:41] GABE: what the fuck
[2024-05-05T15:10:14] Yamal: What is the difference between spintend 85/250 and shullc350??? Is it worth paying almost double?

[2024-05-05T16:44:15] GABE: If I buy 6 more Mh1 cells in order to make 14s6p, will there be issues if the cell ages are mixed?
[2024-05-05T16:44:32] GABE: It will be 6p, so I can put all the new ones in one single parallel line.
[2024-05-05T16:46:02] GABE: Might get more to make like 13s7p, also the MH1s on nkon are 3 years old, which might help.
[2024-05-05T16:49:12] Yamal: You were the one who wanted 150kmh on Xiaomi, from Ireland? It's just that with the profile photo changes I get confused...

[2024-05-05T16:57:25] GABE: Presuming the scooter will be entirely dry inside, is it safe to use these cells without taking the rust off?

[2024-05-05T20:55:25] GABE: motor keeps shuttering sometimes, after that incident of the cell shutting off after 2 people were on the m365.
[2024-05-05T20:55:44] GABE: been happening ever since then.
[2024-05-05T20:55:56] GABE: Motors is HOT
[2024-05-05T20:56:16] GABE: gonna have to drive it on slow to dispel the heat, or it will kill the 250w motor. Never leave mini motors hot by pulling over somewhere
[2024-05-05T20:56:34] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-05-05T20:58:38] haku: i wonder if the other EU scooter league (the slow one) has something to say about this kind of scooter racing

[2024-05-05T21:54:38] Lisa: The 20A foc sinewave esc! Bigger then a house üè†
[2024-05-05T21:58:27] sombre_enfant: Nah i get the 75200 mks bc they fit in my vsett cuz of 6p essentially if i feel the 60h need more powa
[2024-05-05T22:04:45] sombre_enfant: French FB folk recommanding to use backward the disc the level we reached is crazy...
[2024-05-05T22:05:25] sombre_enfant: @NetworkDir look those fit aswell on 10+ with some mod so should do it stock with 10x
[2024-05-05T22:07:26] NetworkDir: They cst 90/65-6?
[2024-05-05T22:07:44] NetworkDir: Yeah looks good
[2024-05-05T22:08:35] NetworkDir: Yeah fit stock zero 10x
[2024-05-05T22:16:30] Rogerio Figueiredo: Why that tire
[2024-05-05T22:28:35] Chen Simhony: hey i want to use my pro 2 screen with x2 75100 is this the newest guide ? https://rollerplausch.com/threads/vesc-controller-einbau-1s-pro2-g30.6032/
[2024-05-05T22:29:17] NetworkDir: Because +80km/h and when acceleration 0-40kmh your ride unstable
[2024-05-05T22:30:18] NetworkDir: Also 10 inch very tiny for 165mm disks xD
[2024-05-05T22:35:11] GABE: Yea
[2024-05-05T22:35:21] GABE: if it's written by kawaiinekololis Zuna
[2024-05-05T22:35:38] Rogerio Figueiredo: Put pmt 10x3.5
[2024-05-05T22:35:53] Rogerio Figueiredo: That tire seams to big
[2024-05-05T22:37:09] Chen Simhony: Yes Did you try to match the dash to the controller?
[2024-05-05T22:37:58] NetworkDir: Zero and vsett rim try press and 10 inch not good
[2024-05-05T22:38:28] NetworkDir: Cst 10x3 design little bit same pmt 10x3.5 but still not good
[2024-05-05T22:40:12] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_14849@05-05-2024_22-40-12.jpg>
[2024-05-05T22:40:12] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_14850@05-05-2024_22-40-12.jpg>
[2024-05-05T22:41:54] sombre_enfant: Yup
[2024-05-05T22:42:24] sombre_enfant: I think the rubber and shape is better than cst on these
[2024-05-05T22:42:38] NetworkDir: I hope these soft tire and good grip road
[2024-05-05T22:43:01] sombre_enfant: Too expensive shit balloon profile
[2024-05-05T22:43:28] NetworkDir: Of course but $$$$ (55‚Ç¨) and without TC rip easily
[2024-05-05T22:43:56] sombre_enfant: Yeah i need when road is a bit wet i already slipped many time on rwd with cst 10*3
[2024-05-05T22:44:38] sombre_enfant: I seen at 30‚Ç¨ pcs but even cheaper from dealer who buy tire from the spain resseller
[2024-05-05T22:45:49] sombre_enfant: Wym ? Yeah it works but never tried his new script i always use the old then use the Throttle direct to the adc so you have Throttle curve and traction controll
[2024-05-05T22:46:09] Chris Culver: Any benefit to doing my battery pack with 999 fine silver connections?
[2024-05-05T22:47:19] haku: yes. you have to make sure you have a clear wrap for everyone to see. thats baller status
[2024-05-05T22:49:55] Rogerio Figueiredo: https://youtu.be/_NE5YM5iIfw?si=IXY88v-ZcTl26ejm The button to turn off the 84100 can e use normal closed simple button on it?
[2024-05-05T22:51:01] Rogerio Figueiredo: At√© they any good?
[2024-05-05T22:52:14] haku: would that tire fit a g30 motor?
[2024-05-05T22:52:17] Konstantin: 84100*2. Delay shutdown, button, sliding
[2024-05-05T22:52:30] Konstantin: Y, I'm use normal close button
[2024-05-05T22:53:41] Chen Simhony: The front light and brake work for you ?
[2024-05-05T22:57:01] sombre_enfant: Yeah it does on a any big motor with 6" motor, not og g30 motor or frame without rear extender
[2024-05-05T22:58:06] sombre_enfant: Front light yes rear u put it on any gnd and 5v with resistor. Or u lenghten the light wire from dash but thats trash
[2024-05-05T23:02:37] NetworkDir: With stock motor no but with 6" bigger motors possible But for g30 motor this tires good

[2024-05-06T02:20:43] GABE: this scooter gonna look stock
[2024-05-06T02:21:05] GABE: MH1 is 6a, M26 is 7.65a
[2024-05-06T02:21:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_14868@06-05-2024_02-21-31.jpg>
[2024-05-06T02:21:45] GABE: my dad used to buy those
[2024-05-06T02:23:34] GABE: @fungus93 what's the max 18650 count vertically in G30?
[2024-05-06T02:26:56] puneDir: Duracell
[2024-05-06T02:35:28] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No success. I went with mxlemming lambda comp, v0 only, longest Zero time. At least I did not hit any ABS over current because of mxlemming obv but it started vibrating at 70 on full throttle. Probably a hardware issue, need to stick with lower battery current or smth... üò≠
[2024-05-06T02:35:57] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I could try without lambda comp, but I doubt that it will change anything.
[2024-05-06T02:37:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Aight
[2024-05-06T02:55:57] haku: what vtc5d 18650 IR?
[2024-05-06T02:57:25] haku: sony vtc6 $1 a cell? that good price?
[2024-05-06T02:58:49] haku: vtc5d sorry
[2024-05-06T03:02:51] haku: do you know IR of these cells?
[2024-05-06T03:06:10] Rogerio Figueiredo: Can you send the link? Can we use key?
[2024-05-06T03:20:08] GABE: Sadly the g30 can only hold 136 cells so I have to go with 17s8p, still 1.5kwh tho.
[2024-05-06T03:20:56] sombre_enfant: U never fit that
[2024-05-06T03:21:05] GABE: 18650
[2024-05-06T03:21:21] GABE: G30 can hold 120 21700 cells with spacers
[2024-05-06T03:21:38] GABE: I probably wont remove the rails, I'll just place it above it.
[2024-05-06T03:30:01] GABE: Good idea
[2024-05-06T03:31:01] GABE: True, and I could use the charger I have now
[2024-05-06T03:31:22] GABE: would have to hard mod the G30 esc
[2024-05-06T03:31:27] GABE: but doable.
[2024-05-06T03:33:09] GABE: no money leftover
[2024-05-06T03:33:14] GABE: I mean I'm planning on selling carts
[2024-05-06T03:33:18] GABE: perhaps I'll get money soon.
[2024-05-06T03:33:32] GABE: sell for 2.5x price, suce.
[2024-05-06T03:34:03] GABE: It'll be lit. maybe I'll fuck more cells into it with an external 1.5l bag Nah I'll just use a complex layout by folding copper to fit the entire 10p internally. It's gonna be such a sleeper.
[2024-05-06T03:39:47] GABE: Also that 350w motor gonna die so ima order a 700w from lonnyo or something
[2024-05-06T03:39:53] GABE: if possible
[2024-05-06T03:40:01] GABE: 800w bit too fat
[2024-05-06T03:40:15] GABE: Yeah surely will go 70 constant
[2024-05-06T03:40:23] GABE: Not enough amps for a motor that size.
[2024-05-06T03:40:32] GABE: I suppose
[2024-05-06T03:41:13] GABE: I mean 4.3kw for a 800w is fine
[2024-05-06T03:41:17] GABE: but I'd prefer 5kw.
[2024-05-06T03:41:28] GABE: 4.3kw 700w seems more fitting
[2024-05-06T03:41:35] GABE: but 350 will Burn surely
[2024-05-06T04:16:53] puneDir: I can't sleep
[2024-05-06T04:16:55] puneDir: Fuck
[2024-05-06T04:16:57] puneDir: 5 am
[2024-05-06T05:06:13] haku: jack off.

[2024-05-06T05:08:20] haku: second time today my 3d printer extruder jammed up. idk maybe crap filament
[2024-05-06T06:30:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Nope. Without Lambda I hit BRK/ABS again at ~70.
[2024-05-06T06:31:40] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Damn it.
[2024-05-06T06:49:29] Yamal: Tonight ‚Äú off topic‚Äù üî•üòÇ

[2024-05-06T06:51:52] Yamal: I like the way Teverun looks more and more
[2024-05-06T06:55:16] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: He was like: nope üòÇ
[2024-05-06T06:58:07] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Might be the motor/cables not able to withstand 200A at high speed. With 150A motor current I was able to full throttle up to 80km/h in comparison. When I keep it low it's fine.
[2024-05-06T06:58:20] haku: the teverun look use to be one of my favorites. but geometry üò≠
[2024-05-06T06:59:33] haku: nami still looks better imo
[2024-05-06T07:59:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: This was an AMAZING race guys

[2024-05-06T09:12:27] Konstantin: It's toggle button , not switch
[2024-05-06T09:22:34] Yamal: There are 4 race in the weekend
[2024-05-06T09:22:35] Yamal: ?
[2024-05-06T09:35:36] sombre_enfant: Yes
[2024-05-06T09:39:53] Rogerio Figueiredo: U need to connect adc3 to ground?
[2024-05-06T09:51:10] Konstantin: Y, + use normal closed toggle button
[2024-05-06T09:54:29] Yamal: 3 Raphael Winn 1 killian ?

[2024-05-06T12:10:32] GABE: Doesn't work as it used to
[2024-05-06T12:10:56] GABE: beautiful scooter that first one
[2024-05-06T12:26:01] Yamal: NAMI ? üòÇ
[2024-05-06T12:51:30] GABE: yeah my one too
[2024-05-06T13:17:05] GABE: I FORGOT TO SOLDER A CHARGE PLUG TO MY batt
[2024-05-06T13:17:13] GABE: how am I so retarded oh my god
[2024-05-06T13:17:43] GABE: now another 1h work for me rekaptoning the baby batt
[2024-05-06T13:31:30] GABE: Fido L3 cell is 13s and has 23.2ah. Honestly pretty chonky, range is above 100km. i need to find out what cells are in there so when I hookup vesc I don't blow it. Ill need 8p MH1 to match this cell. I'm looking at 6s8p, can't do 7s cause my RC charger only does 6s max.
[2024-05-06T13:31:30] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-05-06T13:50:43] GABE: Could I make drone batts with these no? they the same MAH. I'm unsure of the C rating INFINITE MONEY GLITCH sell for 5 a pop lmao and still beat competitor prices

[2024-05-06T14:49:55] Jacob: Hey is it possible to flash m365 firmware onto an unknown name scoots esc and dash?
[2024-05-06T14:50:06] Jacob: Would that work with st link ofc
[2024-05-06T14:55:17] GABE: I need a scooter asap. so I'm gonna mod the m365. I CANT stand the fiido any longer. I wanna get to my exams comfortably. I know what I'm doing tho and projects take so little time nowadays, guess I had a skill issue long ago
[2024-05-06T14:55:50] GABE: I'm gonna resolder the m365 BMS to 10s7p MH1
[2024-05-06T14:55:57] GABE: and then add my 3S6P onto that, I'll have 700wh.
[2024-05-06T14:56:03] GABE: In series

[2024-05-06T17:59:05] Finn: Nice where you going to
[2024-05-06T18:07:28] sombre_enfant: Guys need help real fast where do you see the adress to return when theres a dispute on paypal ?
[2024-05-06T18:09:29] Yamal: I really don‚Äôt know ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
[2024-05-06T18:09:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not sucr
[2024-05-06T18:10:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: Me yesterday almost died cuz of power cut
[2024-05-06T18:12:49] Noname: Where did you buy stuff? Never returned to PayPal they just handle money transactions
[2024-05-06T18:13:58] GABE: Cologne to @nosoudoppi
[2024-05-06T18:14:08] GABE: I'm taking the train from there
[2024-05-06T18:27:31] GABE: Guys I think ima pickup 60 more molis and rebuild the pack to be 20s10p and switch to the g30 lmao. 80 cells external 120 int
[2024-05-06T18:27:48] GABE: And get 70/75h instead
[2024-05-06T18:31:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes it does trigger early. It is supposed to trigger at 430A but on v0.5 it already does on 375A. But that does not explain why VESC decides to peak so high on ABS.
[2024-05-06T18:32:29] sombre_enfant: I found the addy in my mail...now idk how i complete on paypal
[2024-05-06T18:37:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No
[2024-05-06T18:37:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It always triggers in combination with ABS
[2024-05-06T18:38:27] sombre_enfant: Chinese quadlock

[2024-05-06T18:40:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @roscheeee how much motor current do u run on rear motor on 20S with 60H?
[2024-05-06T18:49:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: No suggested if you like your phone

[2024-05-06T18:58:01] haku: it depends if you gave a gift thru friends and family theres no getting that back. all you need to do is click on the payment then dispute
[2024-05-06T18:59:24] haku: might aswell get a frame that can support that weight.
[2024-05-06T18:59:45] haku: and easy to bolt on 11 70h
[2024-05-06T19:02:22] GABE: I might need to get 2 new escs smh.
[2024-05-06T19:03:01] GABE: 16.5kw too much for the 80100
[2024-05-06T19:03:47] haku: you put this all in a g30?
[2024-05-06T19:04:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Good question...
[2024-05-06T19:05:03] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I don't know if recent shown on top or bottom.
[2024-05-06T19:06:54] NetworkDir: I try 180A but motors + stock cable looks unhappy so 150A (also i use 15-20A - 80-90A when long ride only race 50-150A) :D
[2024-05-06T19:08:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: With how much battery current and up to what km/h?
[2024-05-06T19:08:48] GABE: sure 120 int 80 ext
[2024-05-06T19:08:51] GABE: No problem.
[2024-05-06T19:09:44] GABE: Could just make the g30 all internal tbh, perhaps I'll go that way. It'll be a fatass. and nicer to drive.
[2024-05-06T19:09:52] GABE: I have a 3l bag on my m365 rn and I hate it.
[2024-05-06T19:09:59] GABE: so I may invest in something better
[2024-05-06T19:09:59] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-05-06T19:10:42] haku: the hardest part is getting 70h 11" to fit. thats what im thinking too
[2024-05-06T19:11:58] haku: 11" on a g30 is whats holding me back from starting something similar
[2024-05-06T19:13:15] GABE: Easy fit wym
[2024-05-06T19:13:47] haku: no lol. need custom fabrication
[2024-05-06T19:14:01] GABE: Just bolt metal plates and sandwich the forks
[2024-05-06T19:14:04] GABE: make it wider
[2024-05-06T19:14:10] GABE: literally use any metal
[2024-05-06T19:14:12] GABE: sheet
[2024-05-06T19:14:15] GABE: like 0.5vm
[2024-05-06T19:14:15] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-05-06T19:14:49] haku: that will work but it aint gonna be pretty. need lazer cut stainless steel
[2024-05-06T19:15:03] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Damn. Maybe I have put too much battery current. I put 150A
[2024-05-06T19:15:12] haku: also front will also need modifications
[2024-05-06T19:16:25] haku: and an 11" tire you can put a bigger spacer i think
[2024-05-06T19:21:16] Yamal: ESC ?
[2024-05-06T19:21:24] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: MP2 v0.5, rated for 300A
[2024-05-06T19:38:05] GABE: Why not just grinded?
[2024-05-06T19:38:15] GABE: correct.
[2024-05-06T19:43:38] haku: dam why does this keep happening to my extruder. it only happens with white filament.
[2024-05-06T19:43:39] haku: <photos/photo_14876@06-05-2024_19-43-39.jpg>
[2024-05-06T20:23:37] Mirono escooters: That's weird
[2024-05-06T20:23:55] Mirono escooters: How can it do that
[2024-05-06T20:24:23] Mirono escooters: Doesn't make sense
[2024-05-06T20:24:35] Mirono escooters: Try lower retraction
[2024-05-06T20:24:43] Mirono escooters: Or less pressure on filament
[2024-05-06T20:30:52] NetworkDir: trail looks better with 145mm forks..

[2024-05-06T20:33:24] haku: no idea. this happened 3 times already.
[2024-05-06T20:33:55] haku: im using .6 nozzle. my theory is the generic pla runs too hot for my filament
[2024-05-06T20:34:14] haku: idk how to customize it
[2024-05-06T20:35:45] haku: only happens to white pla. its wierd
[2024-05-06T20:45:16] haku: lol reddit.
[2024-05-06T20:45:17] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-05-06T20:51:23] Mirono escooters: Surely you can set temps..
[2024-05-06T20:52:22] haku: yes. i have to research how to do it
[2024-05-06T20:58:39] Mirono escooters: It'll be a simple button
[2024-05-06T20:58:42] Mirono escooters: Under filament
[2024-05-06T20:58:46] Mirono escooters: Print a temp tower
[2024-05-06T21:16:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: True
[2024-05-06T21:17:37] haku: i did not know there are other fork options for zero. very cool
[2024-05-06T21:18:25] sombre_enfant: I got the damper on im aight
[2024-05-06T21:19:44] sombre_enfant: I need to check the design but maybe i lenghten the screw and put a nut and washer at back of it so it has more force
[2024-05-06T21:21:22] sombre_enfant: How did u change the lenght of exa ?
[2024-05-06T21:22:07] NetworkDir: I just put normal fork
[2024-05-06T21:22:15] NetworkDir: It's not exa
[2024-05-06T21:22:18] NetworkDir: Normal suspension
[2024-05-06T21:22:33] sombre_enfant: How good the acceleration is with 150A?
[2024-05-06T21:22:45] sombre_enfant: Hell nah
[2024-05-06T21:22:49] NetworkDir: With something like this cengiz mod suspension and like 145mm But for rear i use 150mm exa 2000lbs
[2024-05-06T21:23:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Well constantly pushing 200A phase on rear is good, but I cannot give you like exact numbers üòÖ
[2024-05-06T21:26:05] sombre_enfant: Yeah but with more battery current the 200A phase is better ? How much u did with the 75100 alu ?
[2024-05-06T21:26:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: With 75100 Alu I only do like 130A phase and max 100A batt
[2024-05-06T21:36:19] GABE: <photos/photo_14881@06-05-2024_21-36-19.jpg>
[2024-05-06T21:38:06] sombre_enfant: Seriously ? Tough u was pushin more phase but 100A bat is decent
[2024-05-06T21:38:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Nah I don't want to take the risk. I sometimes did 145A but I'd rather stay at ~130 to be safe.
[2024-05-06T21:39:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Can't have mosfets blow at high speed
[2024-05-06T21:39:07] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: also front motor doesn't matter
[2024-05-06T21:39:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: traction control reduces it a lot anyway
[2024-05-06T21:39:42] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I mostly get my acceleration from rear that's why I try to push a lot on the rear instead
[2024-05-06T21:40:25] NetworkDir: 60% rear 40% front is good idea
[2024-05-06T21:57:50] haku: thats how i use to balance my soldered cells too. only 12v though
[2024-05-06T22:05:38] haku: this technique is called plastidip isnt it? https://youtube.com/shorts/DBKmeAzfI88?si=pVmGYyvDlTv9D8Hj
[2024-05-06T22:06:41] Noname: Just dipped
[2024-05-06T22:06:59] Noname: Plasti dip is a plastic/rubber spray paint
[2024-05-06T22:07:36] haku: is this dipped in paint? still need to clear coat after?
[2024-05-06T22:08:30] Noname: Idk It's not paint. It's a film they lay on water and spray an activator on then dip.

[2024-05-07T01:48:21] haku: according to the printer lords its called heat creep.

[2024-05-07T11:28:42] Chen Simhony: One more question Can I use a hydraulic brake lever with a cut off sensor like nutt instead of the original brake lever? Or add another throttle instead to replace the stock brake lever?
[2024-05-07T11:45:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is contrary, the cooling is through fr4 pcb instead of aluminum
[2024-05-07T12:13:45] haku: idk thats what ive been told. monkey hear monkey do.
[2024-05-07T12:14:31] haku: so its just hype then. 3shul still the most powerful vesc up to date?
[2024-05-07T12:15:02] haku: how many mosfets does the biggest 3shul have anyway?
[2024-05-07T13:16:26] Yamal: I'm looking forward to seeing the x12 controller work!
[2024-05-07T14:52:18] cihan: Is this a leaking cell?
[2024-05-07T14:54:44] cihan: And this is another cell from the other side of the battery. (not the same cell) They are both positive pole if that separator is placed on positive pole.
[2024-05-07T14:56:03] cihan: Should I keep using the battery until it lasts or change the leaking cell? What's your opinion? One cell group has lower voltage than others but that cell group has no leaking cells.
[2024-05-07T14:56:06] NetworkDir: If it's n65 batt pack normal
[2024-05-07T14:56:27] cihan: Tea, it's n65 battery pack.
[2024-05-07T14:56:41] NetworkDir: Most n65 s have a battery leak problem i see 4-5 fucked packs
[2024-05-07T14:57:00] cihan: Unnamed Chinese ones as I know.
[2024-05-07T14:57:03] NetworkDir: I don't remember but likely shitty chinese
[2024-05-07T14:57:34] NetworkDir: Aspilsan time xD
[2024-05-07T14:58:23] cihan: It's going to be painful, I still didn't get a spot welder, I'll probably solder new cell if I do it now. On the other hand I suspect if all cells will leak in time so maybe I should just stop using this battery but there are many cells in it.
[2024-05-07T14:58:41] cihan: No no, they are no name Chinese
[2024-05-07T14:58:53] NetworkDir: Change cell and sell your scooter
[2024-05-07T14:59:43] cihan: I'm still not sure if I should sell, I'll be back.
[2024-05-07T15:15:51] cihan: I'm sure about it. If 2 cells failed at 900km sooner or later more will fail. Do leaking cells create hazard like hydrogen gas venting, etc? I still eonder why low voltage cell group doesn't have leakage. But some other higher voltage cell groups have.
[2024-05-07T15:18:04] cihan: I like thick navee n65 tires, I didn't have problem with stem. I can sell it for maybe half price of what I paid for it. Now I have makerbase 84100HP and it fits easily, I also have a very thin BMS which fits on top of the battery. Seems like I can fit something between 90-105 cells inside the deck. Isn't it still worth making it VESC?
[2024-05-07T15:20:17] cihan: They say motor isn't bad too. If I sell this one I'll keep using f2 pro for a long time and probably will skip g30 and buy a dual motor scooter, probably vsett 10+ or better and it will cost me much more. Kaabo mantis 10 is blinking eye.
[2024-05-07T15:27:35] Happy Giraffe: If laws are not an issue then surely a bigger scooter aint bad
[2024-05-07T15:28:30] cihan: Laws aren't an issue for now but I'm sure there will be some limitations at some time in future but probably not in the next 4 years.
[2024-05-07T16:30:09] Yamal: Bigger like Dark night
[2024-05-07T16:49:09] cihan: So do you still think that navee n65 isn't worth for VESC? 90 cells probably will let me do 50 km/h with full battery and it will be enough for me. Biggest benefit will be higher acceleration compared to stock controller and battery. Maybe I can use stock battery for a while before more cells leak.)
[2024-05-07T17:40:36] cihan: On the other hand I don't think that this motor can handle more than 1800W and 90 cells are enough for 1800W. I'll need dual motor for more power no matter I use n65 or g30. There are many navee users and there's a Russian group for it but somehow no one did VESC on it. I don't know if it's because n65 isn't worth it or because someone who buys n65 never has enthusiasm for higher speed and knew better options than n65 before buying like me. I guess 2nd group has majority among n65 riders.
[2024-05-07T17:52:55] cihan: I charged the cell group with lowest voltage 4400mAh and still not at the same voltage with other cells. üôÉ What an imbalance Each group is 12500mAh.
[2024-05-07T17:53:12] Simone: The temperatures of MOSFET and motors are very strange....you tried it in Greenland? üòÅüòÇüòÇ
[2024-05-07T17:53:56] cihan: I'm balancing cells at 3.76V. I'll charge the battery externally and check how cell voltages differ while whole pack is being charged.
[2024-05-07T17:55:15] cihan: Can I charge the battery via output connector while it's still attached to the BMS? Would it be a problem?
[2024-05-07T18:19:04] Happy Giraffe: 20s4p P45B battery would kick ass
[2024-05-07T18:23:14] Happy Giraffe: Overheating isnt about the wattage but how long the higher phase current is applied and how much load the motor is getting from weight, wind, hills etc.
[2024-05-07T18:45:50] cihan: It is but expensive. And I have very limited room, hight of the cell matters for me . I'll stick with Aspilsan 18650, it's cheap. If it doesn't leak it's best for me. I can fit something between 90 and 105 cells. But I need a spot welder first. üôÉ
[2024-05-07T18:46:19] cihan: I'm 105 kg so it'll probably have to work hard.)
[2024-05-07T18:46:57] cihan: I can use 1800W in winters and 1200W in summers maybe

[2024-05-07T22:05:24] Happy Giraffe: I doubt it because a panda is very important animal to them...atleast 99.9% of chinese will spot a real panda even two wine bottles drunk

[2024-05-08T01:26:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I have now tried with 120A battery with 190A and 130A phase. 190A triggered BRK again, 130A phase was better but also started acting up at 85km/h. Guess I fucked up when building the ESC. Never had these issues with my previous one :/ Tested with mxlemming observer only.
[2024-05-08T01:26:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: The only thing I could try is fully resoldering the phase wiring, that's the only thing I could think of that might be bad

[2024-05-08T01:35:13] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: That's kinda what I'm doing, low power ESC on front, (usually) high power ESC on the rear.

[2024-05-08T18:23:59] GABE: I heard "you're dead' when they realized my manuever

[2024-05-08T18:28:26] GABE: I have exams and these fuckers are outside
[2024-05-08T18:28:30] GABE: I was on my way home
[2024-05-08T18:29:06] GABE: If I was on 10s instead of 13s I'd be gonezo
[2024-05-08T18:29:19] Yamal: But do you live there with your family or have you gone just to study?
[2024-05-08T18:29:32] GABE: Family, my uni is 35 min away
[2024-05-08T18:30:34] Yamal: I thought that in the countries of northern Europe they were more "civilized" but in short there are criminals everywhere...
[2024-05-08T18:33:42] Yamal: Do you know them at all or were they just fooling around? @Gabzy_x

[2024-05-08T18:36:36] Noname: I'd say more of a city thing. I could leave my keys in my car and go on vacation.
[2024-05-08T18:37:11] Noname: I had friends that left their front door open when they weren't home
[2024-05-08T18:37:35] GABE: Those aren't common, but shit like this instance is.
[2024-05-08T18:37:45] GABE: Crime outside is high. but I've never heard of a house getting broken into

[2024-05-08T18:39:33] Noname: So like purse and bike theft
[2024-05-08T18:40:33] NetworkDir: Yep but if your max speed 70-80 Cst 10x3 better
[2024-05-08T18:43:54] haku: the assholes are the folks who buy those. there are refillable ones you can get
[2024-05-08T18:44:10] Yamal: Your solution is called "500A phase"
[2024-05-08T18:53:49] Yamal: East cost
[2024-05-08T18:54:19] Noname: Yup
[2024-05-08T18:55:48] Yamal: In my land, if you drop a bill, it does not directly touch the ground, we are in the land of hunger, brother.
[2024-05-08T18:56:28] Yamal: Just kidding, it's not that exaggerated, but this is definitely not the channel to talk about this I think...
[2024-05-08T19:05:48] Happy Giraffe: Ireland is country of potato farmersüòÅ But its offtopic

[2024-05-08T20:29:03] GABE: It's a block.
[2024-05-08T21:35:56] sombre_enfant: Look at the caliper measurement the bad one is 260mm the xiaocheng is 270mm so 11"

[2024-05-08T22:22:24] haku: all speed no torque yea?
[2024-05-08T22:28:43] Finn: Probably for rear so its no speed and all torque
[2024-05-08T22:42:15] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: This 10x3 https://a.aliexpress.com/_oBHIr8E

[2024-05-08T22:45:53] haku: i wonder if you can make home made pcb boards by hand
[2024-05-08T22:56:50] NetworkDir: Sure 10mm = ~0.39" At all i dont recommend xuancheng because layers really shit just 1 rock can fry you

[2024-05-08T23:19:58] GABE: wonder if the vdrop will be less xd
[2024-05-08T23:35:24] haku: mh1 good cells?
[2024-05-08T23:36:16] GABE: Best 18650 high capacity there is.
[2024-05-08T23:36:21] GABE: 3200mah 6A
[2024-05-08T23:36:31] GABE: Vsag over 6a but not too bad
[2024-05-08T23:36:44] haku: really? better than panasonics?
[2024-05-08T23:36:44] GABE: This is 24ah
[2024-05-08T23:36:55] GABE: Uhh which model
[2024-05-08T23:37:03] GABE: 6s8p
[2024-05-08T23:37:23] GABE: this will be going to my 24ah 13s that the FIIDO has, so 19s 50a total.
[2024-05-08T23:37:55] haku: this is what you want on your fiido baby
[2024-05-08T23:38:14] GABE: Fiido L3 cell is bigger
[2024-05-08T23:38:19] GABE: 24ah 1200wh or so
[2024-05-08T23:38:27] haku: battery for exoskeleton rape machines
[2024-05-08T23:38:50] GABE: Meh I wouldn't trust molicel on that frame
[2024-05-08T23:38:55] GABE: I simply can't
[2024-05-08T23:39:22] haku: the fiido q is a good frame i think
[2024-05-08T23:39:45] haku: q1s
[2024-05-08T23:40:20] GABE: if it has Sus sure
[2024-05-08T23:40:22] GABE: this one doesn't
[2024-05-08T23:40:36] GABE: ironic, cause its the most expensive one
[2024-05-08T23:40:48] haku: what model is yours?
[2024-05-08T23:40:53] GABE: L3
[2024-05-08T23:41:32] haku: yea little folding one
[2024-05-08T23:41:43] GABE: only consumer PEV where the range isn't awful
[2024-05-08T23:42:55] Happy Giraffe: Even Samsung 35E is miles better, let alone if using high discharge then 3Ah power cells are betterüòÅ
[2024-05-08T23:43:42] Happy Giraffe: MH1 still not Chinese and do have good capacity on low load tho
[2024-05-08T23:46:08] haku: fiido doesnt even sell the q1s anymore. theres a community for that minibike
[2024-05-08T23:47:04] haku: q1s i think
[2024-05-08T23:47:28] haku: <photos/photo_14903@08-05-2024_23-47-28.jpg>
[2024-05-08T23:48:07] haku: lonnyo has a motor for these wich is wierd
[2024-05-08T23:48:49] Happy Giraffe: Lmao what a scam price
[2024-05-08T23:48:51] Happy Giraffe: No
[2024-05-08T23:48:56] haku: no idea but its very old model
[2024-05-08T23:49:39] Happy Giraffe: I wonder why crap like this exists...
[2024-05-08T23:49:43] GABE: Lmao, Ireland sellers sell the shit 300w fiido L3 motor for
[2024-05-08T23:49:45] GABE: 600
[2024-05-08T23:49:47] GABE: euros
[2024-05-08T23:49:50] GABE: check
[2024-05-08T23:49:58] GABE: dead ass
[2024-05-08T23:50:05] haku: i think this model is what started the mini pev ebike trend
[2024-05-08T23:50:15] GABE: China engineering, nothing to see here.
[2024-05-08T23:50:18] Happy Giraffe: Get 125cc pitbike frameüòÅ
[2024-05-08T23:50:41] GABE: Dead short on vape output.
[2024-05-08T23:50:42] haku: small is good. tgose are still big imo
[2024-05-08T23:50:47] GABE: oh this isn't offtopic
[2024-05-08T23:51:36] Happy Giraffe: @jamessoderstrom but I wouldnt get anything too small. Could be a headache, especially for parts/engineering quality
[2024-05-08T23:52:34] GABE: Realized this has a full tank after battery extraction
[2024-05-08T23:52:37] haku: ive been looking at these for the longest time.
[2024-05-08T23:52:42] GABE: meaning it's brand new, I fixed the short.
[2024-05-08T23:52:45] GABE: I'm so hitting this
[2024-05-08T23:52:49] haku: 80h will fit
[2024-05-08T23:52:56] GABE: Looks hyper unstable.
[2024-05-08T23:53:01] haku: idk
[2024-05-08T23:53:41] GABE: charging it with the RC charger rn
[2024-05-08T23:53:46] GABE: RC charger coming in clutch
[2024-05-08T23:53:51] Happy Giraffe: On ebike you really dont want a hub driveüòÅ The crap weighs a ton and overheats so fast haha
[2024-05-08T23:54:04] GABE: Isn't front wheel drive on an E-Bike a deathtrap top.
[2024-05-08T23:54:06] GABE: too?
[2024-05-08T23:54:33] Happy Giraffe: Steering agle level = deathwishüòÇ
[2024-05-08T23:54:58] GABE: I made a vehicle in banjo kazzoie nuts and bolts like that and it would constantly flip over
[2024-05-08T23:55:12] GABE: If y'all haven't played this game... as an engineer... what are you doing
[2024-05-08T23:55:15] GABE: It's a must play
[2024-05-08T23:55:19] GABE: for everyone here
[2024-05-08T23:55:24] Happy Giraffe: Not if they are these legal 250w shits but they are somewhat shitty to ride on wetty/sandy road due to losing grip on turns
[2024-05-08T23:56:40] Happy Giraffe: Haha yeah, I got one thats missing one bearing. Has an old rotor on motor and is shitty to do chainline on 99% of bike framesüòÇ
[2024-05-08T23:56:43] haku: true.
[2024-05-08T23:57:02] haku: bmx would be a good platform too
[2024-05-08T23:57:09] GABE: It would be.
[2024-05-08T23:57:14] GABE: Very much so
[2024-05-08T23:57:17] GABE: also hyper strong
[2024-05-08T23:57:29] GABE: And cheap as shit
[2024-05-08T23:57:29] haku: its just the triangle is so small
[2024-05-08T23:57:42] Happy Giraffe: This would be fun, I wonder how good the internal reduction holds up but 100A phase is doable on upgraded steel gear
[2024-05-08T23:58:05] Happy Giraffe: Its like 21.9:1 or something like that
[2024-05-08T23:58:07] GABE: Yeah I think my ebike Motor is reduced. awful. it's so noisy
[2024-05-08T23:58:15] GABE: Should work fine with low phase at 19s hopefully
[2024-05-08T23:58:26] GABE: No hard starts.
[2024-05-08T23:58:28] Happy Giraffe: That 100A will smoke a 12kw surron just saying...üòÇ
[2024-05-08T23:58:45] GABE: On a scooter yeah
[2024-05-08T23:59:04] GABE: Scooters are king :)
[2024-05-08T23:59:13] Happy Giraffe: Then get lightning rods motorüòÅ
[2024-05-08T23:59:30] Happy Giraffe: But finding a frame for that...good lucküòÇ
[2024-05-08T23:59:47] Happy Giraffe: Not sure, he sells many widths
[2024-05-09T00:00:54] Happy Giraffe: 250cc frame and qs138?üåö
[2024-05-09T00:01:39] Happy Giraffe: Small and 30kw doesn't happen in same sentence
[2024-05-09T00:02:13] GABE: Biological temp sensor
[2024-05-09T00:02:57] Happy Giraffe: Lightning rods into a DH bike frame is your best bet, can keep it around 45kg and has more power than you have balls to use throttle
[2024-05-09T00:02:57] GABE: Me with the 33kw G30 xd
[2024-05-09T00:03:20] GABE: The bike can't take a break xd
[2024-05-09T00:04:28] Happy Giraffe: Its not that bad I think
[2024-05-09T00:04:48] Happy Giraffe: But surely coppers see its not a 250w and neither a 1000wüòÇ
[2024-05-09T00:05:45] Happy Giraffe: Bbshd at 72v might be enough for you. We will see how it does when I get mine up and running
[2024-05-09T00:06:06] Happy Giraffe: Atleast its 1000w for real and can have pedal assistance
[2024-05-09T00:07:37] Happy Giraffe: Coppers just have no idea its 72v instead of 48/52v and has field weakening making it spin 14k rpmüåö
[2024-05-09T00:08:30] Happy Giraffe: Nobody has done a 30s bbshd yet. I wonder if special bearings can handle the 20k rpmüòÇ
[2024-05-09T00:11:53] Happy Giraffe: Thats true, is the limit like 100k?
[2024-05-09T00:15:02] Happy Giraffe: On motor poles BBSHD has 8 so 20k rpm would be 160k or 80k? If it reads them in pairs?
[2024-05-09T00:17:54] NetworkDir: I think limit is 150k erpm
[2024-05-09T00:18:09] GABE: what happens if you go over
[2024-05-09T00:18:10] GABE: ?
[2024-05-09T00:20:05] Happy Giraffe: Then no problem 80k erpmüòÇ
[2024-05-09T00:21:00] Happy Giraffe: Luna cycle limits their motors setup to 26k erpm or 6500 real rpm
[2024-05-09T00:21:05] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2024-05-09T00:21:30] NetworkDir: I think problem is MCU and can't handle +150k Looks if you over erpm mcu crashs
[2024-05-09T00:22:11] Happy Giraffe: Need x64 platform to run it lol (got one old 8-core Ryzen ready, sadly vesc cant supply 100A of 1.2vüòÅ)
[2024-05-09T00:25:11] NetworkDir: This volt diff normal after full charging ?
[2024-05-09T00:26:26] NetworkDir: i have a 2 battery pack in parallel and jkbms only charge 83.85V max and another battery charge 84V
[2024-05-09T00:28:20] NetworkDir: Now vesc works at 168mhz xD If you put 1ghz cpu it's should work nicely
[2024-05-09T00:43:42] GABE: nice transformer could do it.
[2024-05-09T00:43:54] GABE: few of them
[2024-05-09T00:57:51] haku: i like surrons. its just the bad riders i dont like
[2024-05-09T00:59:35] haku: surron also a great platform so many parts available

Fuck it, I will open it up and resolder phases and look if I can tell if something is broken. Or I use my second alu button plate to build yet another ESC üòÇ
[2024-05-09T05:55:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I bet it's my poor soldering on the phases.

I drive 20s accu for the last 4500km and have no problems, but a friend did the same with 20s and the controller blew up after first 2km drive. Its not about power, its about safety my controller not also blew up while driving a big scooter tour. Have someone tipps for me wich controller are the best for this setup? Thank you very much üòäüôèüèº
[2024-05-09T11:08:37] Lisa: Yes, did it block the motor when it blew?
[2024-05-09T11:08:55] Patrick: Exactly i think the mosphets burn
[2024-05-09T11:09:29] Lisa: Yep flipsky, makerbase Esc?

[2024-05-09T12:54:02] GABE: Lmao
[2024-05-09T12:54:13] GABE: 25a ya? the cell is capable of like 80
[2024-05-09T12:54:25] GABE: I'm gonna try put 40a or so with the STOCK cell, so no 6s.
[2024-05-09T12:54:36] GABE: Let's see how much power was hidden within the stock bike nearly finished wiring, and I'll use sensorless. I'm missing a cable.
[2024-05-09T13:13:24] GABE: Had to use 20s to turn on the vesc. what a drag.

[2024-05-09T14:23:32] GABE: Ugh china always switches up the fucking ADC shit
[2024-05-09T14:27:03] GABE: doesn't work regardless of the configuration, but it's in parallel with a brake, and that's working. IMA go out on a ride using the left brake as gas

[2024-05-09T18:22:36] GABE: @fungus93 just to verify you put 20s10p in the G30 with XESC?,
[2024-05-09T18:22:55] GABE: I'm looking to see if 20s11/12p is possible with flat VESC
[2024-05-09T18:23:16] GABE: May I please ask for your blueprint? you would make my day
[2024-05-09T18:26:54] NetworkDir: Yes you can put but 45-50mm extender needed !
[2024-05-09T18:31:08] GABE: That's fine, I'll have 11 inch and tall suspension
[2024-05-09T18:31:36] GABE: So 20s11/12p possible depending how I mount the suspension
[2024-05-09T18:38:16] rosheee: biggest extender ever
[2024-05-09T18:38:26] GABE: OK so There is no voltage at the pins
[2024-05-09T18:38:27] GABE: good sign
[2024-05-09T18:38:37] GABE: it means maybe the FETs in the cells got blasted when the power halted
[2024-05-09T18:38:52] GABE: Meaning I can still make 11s8p Moli and 6s8p mh1 and be able to ride to my exams.

[2024-05-09T18:39:55] GABE: BOTH faults may have occured at the same time I speculate.
[2024-05-09T18:40:27] GABE: doesn't explain the dead batt
[2024-05-09T18:40:43] GABE: No shorts.

[2024-05-09T19:25:43] GABE: Oh, the cell was the cause, I believe the logic board was in
[2024-05-09T19:25:48] GABE: perhaps I tugged on it while opening it
[2024-05-09T19:26:00] GABE: Cell has 0v ESC still dead anyways.
[2024-05-09T19:33:08] GABE: Bms needs to be disconnected I believe.
[2024-05-09T19:33:11] GABE: Have to open it all up.
[2024-05-09T19:33:35] GABE: I can put the stock esc back in in 15 min.
[2024-05-09T19:33:38] GABE: No sweat. I'm not not assed to wire new cells so fixing this one is easier
[2024-05-09T19:49:18] GABE: Doesn't work.

[2024-05-10T23:20:19] GABE: Perfect timing.
[2024-05-10T23:21:02] GABE: I'm not going in for that shit dawg
[2024-05-10T23:22:09] Happy Giraffe: When you produce own frame?üåö
[2024-05-10T23:26:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: Well, we could as we have almost all pieces redesigned, but, too much money to engage while we can use Thunder parts that are perfect for now for the use
[2024-05-10T23:26:18] Face de Pin Suc√©: We prepare some footages with telemetry üòÅ
[2024-05-10T23:29:12] haku: i was a stud at that age if i remember.

[2024-05-10T23:39:22] Noname: Damn karate kid had a 8 pack
[2024-05-10T23:42:24] GABE: I was a stud like 16-18 lol
[2024-05-10T23:42:44] haku: i was a stud when i came out of my dads balls
[2024-05-10T23:43:38] GABE: Ima have the most beastly ninebot G30 out there
[2024-05-10T23:43:58] GABE: 11 inch 20s10p P42A with Double 70h 22x3 üò≠
[2024-05-10T23:44:11] GABE: Range for days
[2024-05-10T23:44:34] GABE: 20s12p possible it I go lower lol
[2024-05-11T00:03:59] rosheee: <animation>
[2024-05-11T00:04:44] rosheee: yes..but u go 11"..so it isn't basically no g30 anymore..u do heavy frame mods..and this and that and go 11"..so it hasn't the essence anymore..
[2024-05-11T00:04:59] GABE: I disagree!!!!
[2024-05-11T00:05:03] rosheee: i know
[2024-05-11T00:05:03] rosheee: XD
[2024-05-11T00:05:11] Face de Pin Suc√©: I agree
[2024-05-11T00:05:29] GABE: I'm doing that in Germany lol
[2024-05-11T00:05:52] Lisa: Hello guys I need help, My ninebot G30 with dual 6.05 adc script from @kawaiinekololis, The front motor is good, 20Kmh but at the back the motor is running without any limit in not secret mode,, When front motor maxes out the back phushes more‚Ä¶ Any ideas?
[2024-05-11T00:05:52] rosheee: where u from ^^?
[2024-05-11T00:06:36] GABE: My wallet for this 40kw G30 is gonna kill me
[2024-05-11T00:06:42] GABE: I can't anymore lol hahahaha
[2024-05-11T00:06:46] GABE: I'm in Ireland rn

[2024-05-11T00:07:11] GABE: <sticker>
[2024-05-11T00:07:11] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-05-11T00:07:35] rosheee: but good that u hyped AF üòÉ post here and in the g30 group pls

[2024-05-11T00:08:02] puneDir: S21 ultra feels so different after redmi
[2024-05-11T00:08:46] haku: whats better?
[2024-05-11T00:10:08] Yamal: ESC ?
[2024-05-11T00:10:52] GABE: 2x 80100 Now for 26KW, soon will be upgraded to 2x 200a 12 fet
[2024-05-11T00:11:29] GABE: Then can utilize full 40kw.
[2024-05-11T00:11:59] GABE: So 52hp
[2024-05-11T00:12:04] Yamal: 200a , 85/200 spintend?
[2024-05-11T00:12:09] GABE: Yeah probably so
[2024-05-11T00:12:16] GABE: 20s hardware is nice and cheap
[2024-05-11T00:12:21] GABE: while still good at high amps
[2024-05-11T00:12:29] GABE: Motors good enough for some nice fwk
[2024-05-11T00:12:34] Yamal: Why g30üòÅ?
[2024-05-11T00:12:59] GABE: Hard frame mod so why not Also, cheap, and good frame, and I'm light
[2024-05-11T00:13:03] GABE: I secured this frame for 70
[2024-05-11T00:13:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: You know
[2024-05-11T00:13:14] Yamal: ü§ôüëç
[2024-05-11T00:13:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: Before talking about 40KW
[2024-05-11T00:13:22] rosheee: üòÉ
[2024-05-11T00:13:29] rosheee: thx @SibClimb ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2024-05-11T00:13:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: Try at least to reach 30KW :)
[2024-05-11T00:13:38] rosheee: or 10 ^^
[2024-05-11T00:13:49] GABE: Yeah I'll be only going with 26kw till I get my new escs anyway
[2024-05-11T00:13:57] GABE: 11" tyres
[2024-05-11T00:14:02] Face de Pin Suc√©: 10 is quite easy these days, even 20 if you are not too idiot x)
[2024-05-11T00:14:03] rosheee: 10kw i mean
[2024-05-11T00:14:16] GABE: I've only played around with 3.5kw lulz.
[2024-05-11T00:14:35] GABE: I'll try 5kw first
[2024-05-11T00:14:40] GABE: should be a nice step up
[2024-05-11T00:14:50] Face de Pin Suc√©: But going up to 30KW requires a bit of work, then every KW after is something else
[2024-05-11T00:15:10] GABE: Will never use the current XD, wait can this scooter compete in your races?
[2024-05-11T00:15:15] GABE: THERE is no bag
[2024-05-11T00:15:18] GABE: all internal it'll be
[2024-05-11T00:16:05] rosheee: 20s6p with internal escs need 30mm spacer with 5mm alu plate so 35mm ^^ and u wanna go 10..so 70mm spacer?
[2024-05-11T00:16:16] GABE: Complex layout.
[2024-05-11T00:16:25] GABE: Somewhat
[2024-05-11T00:16:40] GABE: this is 20s10p 18650
[2024-05-11T00:17:09] rosheee: why red xD?
[2024-05-11T00:17:27] GABE: How scary is it?
[2024-05-11T00:17:44] Face de Pin Suc√©: If all internal, and using hydraulic brakes and reading the rules, yes
[2024-05-11T00:17:57] Face de Pin Suc√©: Because I shouldn't even show this x)
[2024-05-11T00:17:58] GABE: Hydraulic of course!!
[2024-05-11T00:18:06] GABE: MT5.
[2024-05-11T00:18:28] Face de Pin Suc√©: Poof like never happened until screenshots x)
[2024-05-11T00:18:41] Face de Pin Suc√©: Not powerful enough
[2024-05-11T00:19:05] GABE: Ya telling me 50hp isn't crazy ü§îü§îü§î
[2024-05-11T00:19:10] GABE: On a little thing
[2024-05-11T00:19:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: No because over half of power is wasted in heat
[2024-05-11T00:20:17] GABE: I forgot efficiency is shit when copper is hot.
[2024-05-11T00:20:19] GABE: Lmfao
[2024-05-11T00:21:26] rosheee: ^^ it wll be pain and nice 2 build
[2024-05-11T00:22:31] GABE: REBuilding pack and mounting rear fork, yes.
[2024-05-11T00:22:47] rosheee: and wiring will be ^^
[2024-05-11T00:22:56] GABE: Should be cleaner than right now.
[2024-05-11T00:23:07] GABE: Perhaps even perfect layout possible
[2024-05-11T00:23:20] Yamal: Bac 8000 in this proyect
[2024-05-11T00:24:56] Yamal: and you will put the engines at speed I imagine
[2024-05-11T00:25:07] rosheee: he should go 33x2
[2024-05-11T00:25:19] rosheee: but then need steering geometry done better
[2024-05-11T00:25:28] rosheee: and reinforce everythoimg
[2024-05-11T00:26:31] Yamal: Can't you put more than 20s? 22/24s for more top speed!!!
[2024-05-11T00:26:40] GABE: More heat less efficiency meh. Also I will never go faster than 100.
[2024-05-11T00:26:47] GABE: I just want a cell that will last for 8000 cycles.
[2024-05-11T00:26:50] rosheee: XD
[2024-05-11T00:27:10] GABE: 35-65 cycle gap lol
[2024-05-11T00:27:36] GABE: 20-80**
[2024-05-11T00:28:34] Yamal: The true passion you have for Ninebots is impressive.
[2024-05-11T00:30:24] puneDir: S21u
[2024-05-11T00:32:00] Face de Pin Suc√©: Well, you get used to power
[2024-05-11T00:32:10] GABE: It's like heroin.
[2024-05-11T00:32:15] GABE: always want more
[2024-05-11T00:32:19] GABE: until you die
[2024-05-11T00:32:21] GABE: XD
[2024-05-11T00:32:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: Like for real, when I tested launch start I was like "it's not powerful"
[2024-05-11T00:32:54] Jan: This is not true
[2024-05-11T00:33:00] Jan: You got less resistance
[2024-05-11T00:33:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: Turns out this scooter is capable to do launch start from P7 to P1 in 150m straight against all best scooters
[2024-05-11T00:33:18] GABE: Isn't it more? tf
[2024-05-11T00:33:28] Jan: No you have thicker wiring
[2024-05-11T00:52:53] puneDir: I will tomorrow morning
[2024-05-11T00:53:10] puneDir: But it pulls down the en pin voltage
[2024-05-11T00:53:30] puneDir: On voltage regulator
[2024-05-11T00:53:48] puneDir: 10k between gnd and en
[2024-05-11T00:54:07] puneDir: Low voltage on en = disabled 12v
[2024-05-11T00:58:46] sombre_enfant: Not bad u know what ambrosini team using? Especially the blue nami if its all skill or a bit of hardware
[2024-05-11T00:59:04] sombre_enfant: The esc, motor are knew battery idc
[2024-05-11T01:02:07] Yamal: All with Kelly
[2024-05-11T01:19:53] puneDir: Yes its all
[2024-05-11T01:28:27] sombre_enfant: Hmm not sure
[2024-05-11T01:29:02] sombre_enfant: Theyre testing toll fet so i dont think its kelly
[2024-05-11T01:29:29] sombre_enfant: Even if u really skilled its hard to match other if u use 7230
[2024-05-11T01:38:26] GABE: rocket
[2024-05-11T01:46:10] Happy Giraffe: Even 4kw on a mid drive bike is nutsüòÇ
[2024-05-11T01:47:30] Happy Giraffe: Frames cant handle it, regular shity mtb frame starts to yield
[2024-05-11T01:48:09] Happy Giraffe: Even best DH frames and the older beefy special version that I have cant take more than 10-12kw I think
[2024-05-11T01:48:46] Happy Giraffe: Scooters have like 5x less torque on wheelüòÅ
[2024-05-11T01:48:47] sombre_enfant: Because expensive bike is a lighter bike
[2024-05-11T01:49:42] Happy Giraffe: Also chainlines etc become an issue, rear hubs need to be custom or welded or something like that
[2024-05-11T01:50:32] Happy Giraffe: Its still trueüòÅ a small 2wd wheel needs speed and not torque. One big wheel just wants torque
[2024-05-11T01:51:09] Happy Giraffe: Tires almost 3x the sizeüòÅ
[2024-05-11T01:52:21] puneDir: Puneron handles
[2024-05-11T01:52:28] Happy Giraffe: On scooter 10" wheel its burnout caregory, on bike its mehhüòÅ
[2024-05-11T01:53:28] Happy Giraffe: But heavier motor, heavier battery, heavier chain, moto tires (2-3x heavier vs. bicycle), beefier frame needed
[2024-05-11T01:53:47] Happy Giraffe: Yup
[2024-05-11T01:54:09] puneDir: <photos/photo_14948@11-05-2024_01-54-09.jpg>
[2024-05-11T01:54:17] puneDir: Rim size sprocket
[2024-05-11T01:55:11] puneDir: bikes wheelie
[2024-05-11T01:55:13] puneDir: Scoot not
[2024-05-11T01:55:20] Happy Giraffe: LR is doing some funny stuff as their custom frame design is not getting finished lol
[2024-05-11T01:55:29] puneDir: Yes but not fun as bike
[2024-05-11T01:55:59] Happy Giraffe: Check this Orton guy from UK, he makes custom framesüòÅ LR or QS138 would be a monster
[2024-05-11T01:56:36] GABE: can use industrial motor
[2024-05-11T01:56:40] GABE: ez
[2024-05-11T01:56:49] Happy Giraffe: Then your only option is like Cyc Pro 4 and thats like 1400‚Ç¨ and Im expexting it to be full of issuesüòÅ
[2024-05-11T01:57:33] Happy Giraffe: Maybe a QS90 or 120 in a custom made frame is the answer. Can hide batt inside frame tubeüòÅ
[2024-05-11T01:58:10] Happy Giraffe: They are worse than 72v bbshd but the next gen is bigger motor. Might be decent if they dont fuck it up
[2024-05-11T01:59:11] Happy Giraffe: Yes and their shit brakes down unexpectedlyüòÅ Bbshd most reliable ebike motor there is. You can service it at home easily and spare parts are all over the world
[2024-05-11T01:59:50] Happy Giraffe: After dealing with Grin and Mxus hubs Im never getting a hub motor againüòÇ
[2024-05-11T02:08:19] Happy Giraffe: Inertia is an issue and the high starting torque required. High phase makes heat and they cool badly
[2024-05-11T02:08:26] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2024-05-11T02:10:54] Happy Giraffe: Surron as modded will be closer to 60kg lol and big. Tho you could make mounts in the frame for a shoulder carry strap that has a plate supporting on your shoulderüòÅ
[2024-05-11T02:11:36] Happy Giraffe: Fun climbing stairs with a large object, weight not much of an issue compared to size if the stairs are smallüòÖ
[2024-05-11T02:42:26] haku: im considering one too. but custom frame might be the move
[2024-05-11T02:43:35] haku: if i only knew how to weld and cnc
[2024-05-11T02:45:56] GABE: scooter hubs geared down on a physical level
[2024-05-11T02:46:04] GABE: Bike hubs Gear up
[2024-05-11T02:46:12] GABE: Based on circumference
[2024-05-11T02:46:40] GABE: this is why I speculate mid drive is better than ebike hubs.
[2024-05-11T02:47:10] GABE: can gear to match the motor to the wheel
[2024-05-11T02:47:10] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-05-11T02:52:40] rosheee: <animation>
[2024-05-11T03:06:57] GABE: i mean the opposite
[2024-05-11T03:15:49] rosheee: ok
[2024-05-11T03:26:57] haku: here it is boys. 490 p42s from these cyborg robot packs
[2024-05-11T03:27:21] haku: military shit.
[2024-05-11T03:29:21] rosheee: p42s?
[2024-05-11T03:29:32] haku: yep p42a
[2024-05-11T03:29:38] rosheee: ah p42a xD
[2024-05-11T03:29:54] rosheee: what u doing with them?
[2024-05-11T03:30:03] haku: no idea lol
[2024-05-11T03:30:12] rosheee: y u have them xD?
[2024-05-11T03:30:18] haku: probably a future project
[2024-05-11T03:30:45] haku: i really wanted p42a instead of 40t for my scoot
[2024-05-11T03:30:58] haku: but the 40t is already built
[2024-05-11T03:32:24] haku: future project will be a gigantamax gengar running p42a
[2024-05-11T03:34:15] haku: also price is too good to miss out on
[2024-05-11T03:34:15] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-05-11T03:56:25] Noname: Wait you bought 7
[2024-05-11T04:03:42] Noname: Your picky. 15a pull would be near 13kw in your scoot.
[2024-05-11T04:06:06] rosheee: ??
[2024-05-11T04:06:25] Noname: @roscheeee He has 40t but wanted to use p42a
[2024-05-11T04:06:34] Noname: In a 20s10p
[2024-05-11T04:13:38] haku: ill just open these up and store em.
[2024-05-11T04:14:02] haku: lucky i got in day 1 of that deal. they raised it again
[2024-05-11T04:14:57] Noname: I'll buy them before they go stale
[2024-05-11T04:14:58] haku: thanks to Noname. haha
[2024-05-11T04:15:06] Noname: Not my doing
[2024-05-11T04:15:12] Noname: Your a hoarder
[2024-05-11T04:15:31] Noname: I'm gluing mine together now
[2024-05-11T04:15:38] haku: i just saw the vtc ones you said there is also a p42.
[2024-05-11T04:15:48] Noname: Oh yeah my doing
[2024-05-11T04:15:59] Noname: I need one of those wood clamps for cells
[2024-05-11T04:16:27] Noname: Only 17 more pairs to glue lol
[2024-05-11T04:16:30] haku: The square ones? i think therrs a primted version
[2024-05-11T04:16:45] Noname: I like wood
[2024-05-11T04:16:58] haku: yes you do
[2024-05-11T04:17:19] Noname: Mr plastic man
[2024-05-11T04:18:09] Noname: I got till June 28
[2024-05-11T04:20:46] haku: @jamessoderstrom does IR change depending on cell voltage?
[2024-05-11T04:21:51] Noname: Idk if he got the balls for a 300a pull
[2024-05-11T04:23:28] haku: this case is nice as is. good bolt on for vsett 9
[2024-05-11T04:23:54] haku: looks bullet proof
[2024-05-11T04:25:51] haku: so if a cell is full charge it has lower IR?
[2024-05-11T04:26:30] Noname: <photos/photo_14952@11-05-2024_04-26-30.jpg>
[2024-05-11T04:26:37] haku: hahahaha
[2024-05-11T04:27:27] haku: ill dissasemble all these first then ill finish that. need room

[2024-05-11T08:16:17] Chris Culver: Someone in particular I should send attn to?
[2024-05-11T08:59:04] Cengiz Han GEN√áALƒ∞: To turn off the regulator, it is necessary to pull the en pin to gnd. Do this without resistance NC switch is required. To do it without NC switch, pull it to GND with a 10k resistor. You have to give voltage to remove the en pin from GND. I don't think it is right to give the battery voltage, so I make a voltage divider with 10k and 100k.

[2024-05-11T11:37:18] Awyba: yes kinda i was looking into surron and talaria
[2024-05-11T11:38:33] GABE: of course!
[2024-05-11T11:38:51] GABE: this is why it has less output at lower voltages.

[2024-05-11T12:36:02] GABE: Used to go 40 now can't break 28
[2024-05-11T12:36:24] GABE: Might make a new cell for it tbh.
[2024-05-11T12:36:35] GABE: I'm guessing cells are leaking on something stupid like that
[2024-05-11T12:50:19] Happy Giraffe: Having different winding still won't help. Slower kv hub with 72v still overheatsüòÅ
[2024-05-11T12:51:01] Happy Giraffe: And geared hubs are the worst, those cool down 5 times slower than direct drive hubsüòÇ

[2024-05-11T13:04:03] haku: stock g30 with a square box as a seat full of batteries
[2024-05-11T13:04:40] haku: the range is 8-9
[2024-05-11T13:04:55] GABE: This is like 8p of 21700
[2024-05-11T13:05:10] GABE: easily can make it so much lower and make it a low rider
[2024-05-11T13:07:41] GABE: plus bigger tyres lol
[2024-05-11T13:08:13] haku: get snsc frame. the g30 neck might not support 20s 12p weight
[2024-05-11T13:09:04] GABE: I'll cut the fork for to Fit it like this so the base is levelled
[2024-05-11T13:09:23] haku: since your going to germany maybe you can "auction" one
[2024-05-11T13:09:27] GABE: I'm only 70kg so it's like a 90kg rider

[2024-05-11T13:17:21] Happy Giraffe: Now that we have someone who understands electronics here...people online said about putting a resistor in throttle. If throttle signal gets removed throttle would go full power but with 10kOhm resistor between GND and 5v they say it's safer thenü§î
[2024-05-11T13:21:16] haku: the french g30 el trott racer has 11". you will need lazer cut forks like that

[2024-05-11T13:39:19] haku: that be really tight in there
[2024-05-11T13:39:38] GABE: Probably not if I plan wiring correctly
[2024-05-11T13:39:44] GABE: and plan the cell correctly
[2024-05-11T13:39:56] GABE: have the plus and minus at the top
[2024-05-11T13:40:06] GABE: Or whatever

[2024-05-11T13:45:18] haku: @jamessoderstrom makes surron batteries like that. sandwiched ask him dimensions
[2024-05-11T13:45:30] GABE: I think I'm using his exact layout actually
[2024-05-11T13:45:31] GABE: Kek
[2024-05-11T13:45:52] GABE: it'll be 20kg
[2024-05-11T13:45:58] GABE: like 40 pounds or so Lmfao range for weeeeeeks
[2024-05-11T13:46:58] haku: you will have the biggest deck baby
[2024-05-11T13:47:06] GABE: 50kg weight I can't carry this up stairs
[2024-05-11T13:47:21] GABE: it would be like carrying a girl with 2 hands up stairs
[2024-05-11T13:48:07] GABE: I might get a meison board.
[2024-05-11T13:48:13] GABE: Might as well get a fatter deck and some blue under lighting

[2024-05-11T23:10:30] haku: tmi i know. just wanted to share the struggle
[2024-05-11T23:12:28] Yamal: It is not necessary to lift so many kilos, in the end it is harmful
[2024-05-11T23:14:01] Yamal: Have you tried Milos Sarcev's giant series?üòé

[2024-05-11T23:22:22] haku: you mean strongman sport?
[2024-05-11T23:22:49] Yamal: Nop
[2024-05-11T23:25:57] Yamal: Milos is a famous trainer for Mr Olympia competitors, he is well known for his giant series, which are based on doing many exercises for the same muscle without rest, going from one machine to another! It's very cool, it's a kind of super series, but 9/10/11 exercises
[2024-05-11T23:26:54] haku: im not much into bodybuilding. but thats cool
[2024-05-11T23:27:32] haku: i need long rests and heavy sets
[2024-05-11T23:28:29] haku: when i was a younger i liked doing it though. natty ofcourse
[2024-05-11T23:30:01] Yamal: https://youtu.be/7WnerAei72Q?si=ehQshX9vwFXzcwCu
[2024-05-11T23:30:05] Yamal: Milos
[2024-05-11T23:30:25] haku: oh yea that guy
[2024-05-11T23:30:31] haku: beast
[2024-05-11T23:31:57] haku: folks say its all steroids. but its hardwork with steroids and diet haha
[2024-05-11T23:33:06] Yamal: It is very good to change the types of training vs rest vs "weights" vs types of exercises, as you well know the human body is a perfect machine and gets used to everything
[2024-05-11T23:34:29] haku: agreed. its good to mix it up. im just to lazy nowadays. what i really need to do is cardio.
[2024-05-11T23:35:18] haku: i need to run/walk witg my dog instead of using a scooter haha
[2024-05-11T23:35:27] Yamal: These people live on that and take their bodies to the extreme, to the limit, and there is no need for any of that... in short, training is health and you can be big or in good physical shape without any "help."üòÇ
[2024-05-11T23:36:18] haku: these guys are on all kinds of drugs though. its unatural. it looks cool being that big though
[2024-05-11T23:37:00] Yamal: Cardio is what is most difficult but it gets the body in tune, makes you agile and feels amazing!!! Let's see when I start training again heh
[2024-05-11T23:37:12] haku: its part of bodybuilding. even the natural ones do it. they just cycle it so it doesnt show up in drug tests
[2024-05-11T23:37:42] Yamal: forget these people get strong sleeping
[2024-05-11T23:39:03] haku: diet is also a big part. i love junk food and candy
[2024-05-11T23:39:50] Yamal: They recover very quickly in training, in short a world apart that is not worth it at all if you do not live off of them and if so I would think about it, they even take growth hormone, their internal organs also grow, it is very crazy
[2024-05-11T23:40:42] haku: this is thier paycheck. doing this all day is thier job. same with fighters
[2024-05-11T23:40:50] Yamal: Food is everything and it totally makes the difference.
[2024-05-11T23:40:54] haku: and other athletes
[2024-05-11T23:41:43] haku: im sure even the scooter el trott league racers train somehow or keep a strict diet to maintain weight
[2024-05-11T23:42:51] Yamal: bodybuilders who by the way are not at all strict in their diets and training many decels morning and afternoon
[2024-05-11T23:43:49] Yamal: we are surrounded by sugars and carbohydrates
[2024-05-11T23:44:27] haku: specialy here where i live. the nutrition is horrible
[2024-05-11T23:44:55] haku: too lazy to cook real food
[2024-05-11T23:46:04] Yamal: 90% of people do not consume daily protein, which we should, to say the least, a normal person should take gram per kilo of weight and we all fall short when we have finished our day.
[2024-05-11T23:53:30] Yamal: Real food also makes you fat too much, we have a Mediterranean diet in which there is everything, legumes, meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, and in the end you have to know how to measure yourself, know how to keep your mouth shut and not eat so much, eating "contained" dishes, there is a lot of work with all of this and we return to the same thing with the wife and children, things get complicatedüòÇü§ô, you have to take time for yourself, examine yourself and start taking care of yourself, lately I seem like a "fluff" "like those in the series the rings of power
[2024-05-11T23:53:35] haku: imo using GH is not too bad. growth hormone is produced naturaly. artificial injections are just so expensive. i kind of need it actually im asian i need some parts to grow if you know what i mean hehe
[2024-05-11T23:55:18] haku: my peepee never really matured.
[2024-05-11T23:59:08] GABE: Jeff bezos would not pay me 1 million to admit that
[2024-05-12T00:00:02] GABE: walk with your dog an hour a day
[2024-05-12T00:00:06] GABE: you'll drop fat
[2024-05-12T00:01:13] haku: im in the acceptance part of grieving.
[2024-05-12T00:02:26] Yamal: I liked natural supplementation: omega 3 pearls, whey protein, casein protein for sleep, tribulus terrestris to promote testosterone, creatine, branched amino acids (BCA) electrolytes, Of course, whoever takes all this at the same time trains hard and a lot, it is not necessary everything at the same time and with all this that I call natural it is good to do "l
[2024-05-12T00:03:19] haku: thats exactly what i use +caffiene (preworkout) wich is bad
[2024-05-12T00:03:43] haku: and i skip the cassien just whey
[2024-05-12T00:04:07] haku: or eat yogurt or goat cheese
[2024-05-12T00:04:14] Yamal: In short, sports supplementation is good and helps! but the best thing is to have periods of using it and stopping time until using it again so that you make the body receptive and assimilate more and better, and in "smaller" quantities the better.
[2024-05-12T00:06:28] Yamal: Everything goes hand in hand, you can take up sports supplementation, and if you don't eat well and train hard, you'll stay like a wire.
[2024-05-12T00:07:13] haku: when i was younger and used to compete i even measure food intake
[2024-05-12T00:07:39] Yamal: In the end, getting on a scooter and pressing the accelerator is easier üòÇ
[2024-05-12T00:07:42] haku: macro nutrients
[2024-05-12T00:10:05] haku: with a child its harder to monitor stuff like that. i cant even work on my stuff when my boy is around.
[2024-05-12T00:10:38] haku: i dont want him smelling like solder when he goes to school
[2024-05-12T00:24:25] Yamal: They are all stages, and you have to enjoy each one of them, starting June 6th I will be alone, to be able to do routes again, to be able to train and not to have fun a little!
[2024-05-12T00:33:04] Yamal: Today I have done a little more than 60km and I have reached 74.5v home, I have not yet taken long trips to the battery until it is dry to see how much I can get out of it..
[2024-05-12T01:37:16] Noname: @Bradhaku oh yeah I asked my buddy about his max mods g30 and said I could have it for 200$ then 100$ then 150$ or whatever I give him lol

[2024-05-13T10:38:02] Rogerio Figueiredo: I don't have sensors on motor for temp
[2024-05-13T10:42:19] Rogerio Figueiredo: In one photo u have 10k in other you have 100k? üòÇ üòÇ What is the good one then? I'm confused
[2024-05-13T10:52:20] puneDir: Nope

[2024-05-13T11:20:19] Rogerio Figueiredo: 100k
[2024-05-13T11:49:24] Mirono escooters: No
[2024-05-13T11:49:46] Mirono escooters: It has a oxidation layer and that's it, protects itself
[2024-05-13T11:50:20] puneDir: Are you blind

[2024-05-13T13:31:42] NetworkDir: Guys vesc can work 1 motor sensorless and 1 motor hall sensor? My rear hall fired but front works I want put ntc on rear and use front hall for better acceleration
[2024-05-13T13:32:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: yes
[2024-05-13T13:32:50] NetworkDir: Nice
[2024-05-13T13:58:13] GABE: sensorless cogs alot, but the front may push it in time
[2024-05-13T13:58:30] GABE: No sensors is like the motor is tied and need to untie itself
[2024-05-13T14:02:26] Happy Giraffe: Nah, sensorless can work good. Im running motor now without halls and it just needs a 10cm push before start
[2024-05-13T14:03:16] Happy Giraffe: If you got one motor without sensor might aswell run both sensorless imo
[2024-05-13T14:04:58] NetworkDir: Without 10cm push motor want suicide xD

[2024-05-13T15:17:57] cihan: Does anyone have an idea about self balancing scooters? A friend wants to buy one for his son and asked me. I think weight of the self balancer is no problem and stronger motor with bigger battery will be better.
[2024-05-13T15:23:27] Rogerio Figueiredo: Lol
[2024-05-13T15:23:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: Where?
[2024-05-13T15:24:17] Rogerio Figueiredo: What is write there isn't 100k
[2024-05-13T16:44:39] sombre_enfant: What button you use on yours ? Do a simple on off button is enough ?
[2024-05-13T17:00:44] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's 550$ without shipping and taxes to France so if you don't need, better to go for a 3Shul at 400‚Ç¨, for a pair it's more than 300‚Ç¨ difference x)
[2024-05-13T17:01:15] Lisa: Yep, rosheee helped me!

[2024-05-13T17:57:50] ElectricPowa: Hi to all and thanks i have a question on a spintend i have installed on a dualtron thunder. Was all good and working. After 4 days of not use the controllers have Lost the configuration and now when i go do the engines test do this.
[2024-05-13T17:57:57] ElectricPowa: <photos/photo_15014@13-05-2024_17-57-57.jpg>

[2024-05-13T18:04:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: Hello guys
[2024-05-13T18:05:02] Face de Pin Suc√©: One question regarding 6.05 beta
[2024-05-13T18:05:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: <photos/photo_15015@13-05-2024_18-05-05.jpg>
[2024-05-13T18:05:50] Face de Pin Suc√©: What is the difference between 6.02 ? we didn't have the first value before
[2024-05-13T18:05:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: @jamessoderstrom any idea ?
[2024-05-13T18:07:57] cihan: I read you can use s2 or s2 max hoverboards with them and they become stronger. Don't know any details though.
[2024-05-13T18:14:54] Noname: I believe there's a communication wire that plugs in to the charge port so it gives more power than when standing.
[2024-05-13T18:42:33] GABE: Stock firmware ?
[2024-05-13T18:45:26] Rogerio Figueiredo: I don't have nothing yet I'm afraid to burn
[2024-05-13T18:45:29] Rogerio Figueiredo: I wanted a key
[2024-05-13T18:47:04] Happy Giraffe: You reseted the vesc parameters when doing motor setup. Adjust max voltage correctly and then it goes away
[2024-05-13T18:47:38] Happy Giraffe: Next time you do motor setup dont select "vesc default parameters" as they will lower max volt limit again
[2024-05-13T18:55:03] Face de Pin Suc√©: Hall interpolation 3000 ? :o
[2024-05-13T18:55:26] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Do small motor don't like filed ? Above 45-55%???

[2024-05-13T19:12:38] GABE: These 104 10A cells would be great for the pro 2.

[2024-05-13T19:18:29] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's for a bigger wheel actually

[2024-05-13T20:51:34] GABE: Charge your laptop from the thing
[2024-05-13T20:51:58] puneDir: No need ac
[2024-05-13T20:52:11] puneDir: You can mod the laptop charger

[2024-05-13T21:11:05] Noname: Yeah thought of that a few times lol. Was looking uo cooler bags for my trip. 12v 50w but they suck. A 6 pack fridge is like 700w 12v
[2024-05-13T21:18:34] haku: the point of camping is to enjoy nature my boy. unless you arw forever camping in a tent
[2024-05-13T21:23:15] GABE: scooter that would be able to go out on trials would be so good too
[2024-05-13T21:23:17] GABE: sick

[2024-05-14T00:58:11] GABE: He's a bit dumbfounded so he said s few weeks and I said sure whatever
[2024-05-14T01:01:49] haku: did you pay in advance?

[2024-05-14T01:57:30] JPPL: Greeny
[2024-05-14T01:59:45] haku: would flipsky be a better option. serious question my guy
[2024-05-14T02:01:25] haku: the alu pcb one
[2024-05-14T02:05:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: Mh i don't think
[2024-05-14T02:06:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: But a cheap vesc like spintend maybe is better than this version of tronic
[2024-05-14T02:10:59] haku: the new x12 tronics are alu pcb?
[2024-05-14T02:30:33] haku: i see.
[2024-05-14T02:31:06] haku: is that better than alu pcb with regular mosfets?

[2024-05-14T02:45:31] Franchesco Carofano: paolo I only asked a question I don't need criticism I already have it I'm testing electronics the 75200 blocked and burned they didn't last at all I'm trying tronic I'm just asking for help
[2024-05-14T03:00:00] Franchesco Carofano: If the 5 new ones arrived, I wanted to see if the accelerator can be bypassed with a single 3-line accelerator.
[2024-05-14T03:04:32] Franchesco Carofano: I'm just looking to solve something, I bought 4, two first and they sent one for warranty and two more that I bought and the 5 had the same problem, I bought them because they were at a good price at Wyrd Ryds but now they say that they will call tronic sistem until they don't respond and they won't refund the money. They don't even send the new tronic the 250r, these are too much, I didn't even mount them, I measured the voltage on the can bus as seen in the video and none of them work, only independent
[2024-05-14T03:09:43] Franchesco Carofano: nothing friend
[2024-05-14T03:11:40] Franchesco Carofano: The ones you see above the battery only connect them to the power and the media bus came as is and the ones I installed did not recognize it only separately.
[2024-05-14T03:14:54] Franchesco Carofano: The one who configured me is Jesus, the Spaniard who has the kidney and exhausted everything, they are broken.
[2024-05-14T03:15:38] Franchesco Carofano: they should mark 3.3vol friend and bada

[2024-05-14T05:11:29] haku: question for the vesc sages. what has more power a 50h but larger diameter stator or a 80h smaller diameter stator? example is qs273 (larger diameter) vs LY 80h. same windings on both.
[2024-05-14T05:26:43] rosheee: i would say 80h. 80h has less kv ^^'
[2024-05-14T05:27:10] rosheee: yes?
[2024-05-14T05:50:50] Noname: 273 is an ebike spoked rim. Ly is scooter motor?

[2024-05-14T16:53:23] Rose: Hey there ƒ∞lkay, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-05-14T16:56:54] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: I'm setting up a project with a 22s battery and looking at the best controller options. I have seen that the ubox 85/250 work relatively well and if I am not mistaken it could last 22s (without electric brake). Has anyone tested them at that voltage?
[2024-05-14T17:20:27] Oreo huzky: Tronic 12x is a very good controller and if you want a controller that is more in the workshop being repaired and has bad customer service get a 3shul controller
[2024-05-14T17:29:28] rosheee: works but nyaeh...it rly peak
[2024-05-14T17:29:39] rosheee: yes
[2024-05-14T17:32:46] rosheee: @SibClimb u changed @Skullrider69 fail 3shul? ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2024-05-14T17:35:04] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: I have also seen the tronic X12 and the 3Shul CL350, I listen to your recommendations on controllers. What I'm looking for is a compact controller that lasts 22s and has good quality/price.
[2024-05-14T17:43:51] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: Thanks for the advice, I will have to look for a tested model that works as standard at 22s, the truth is that I would like to approve the 85/250 at 22s, the price is very good.
[2024-05-14T18:01:10] rosheee: depends on the mosfets

[2024-05-14T19:29:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: Ubox won't work with 22S, even without regen it will fail
[2024-05-14T19:30:37] Face de Pin Suc√©: Without electric brake, C350 is perfect working, we use these on races at full power, no problem, and if you come from here, you get a discount on these :)
[2024-05-14T19:32:00] Face de Pin Suc√©: I told him to come when he wants so I can replace it, but he has to disassemble his controller to do it, so I think he will come when he has time to do it
[2024-05-14T19:32:41] Face de Pin Suc√©: CL350 isn't recommended for 22S, C350 is better as it will heat up a lot less than CL350
[2024-05-14T20:01:52] sombre_enfant: But the rfp version will tho
[2024-05-14T20:02:51] sombre_enfant: Aint u can hotswap since its one connector for every signal wire and the bullet for power ?
[2024-05-14T20:07:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: He made a case for both controllers so not that easy
[2024-05-14T20:08:12] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes heavily modified but he doesn't controllers alone
[2024-05-14T20:09:12] sombre_enfant: Aight i got velcro on mine i change in 1 min
[2024-05-14T20:13:43] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: If the C350 can withstand 22s it would be perfect, as the characteristic indicates 20s I thought that only the CL350 would withstand that voltage. I may finally choose the C350 üòâü§ù
[2024-05-14T20:14:30] Oreo huzky: Please don‚Äôt you will have some many headaches
[2024-05-14T20:18:57] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: Why?
[2024-05-14T20:21:21] sombre_enfant: Hehe
[2024-05-14T20:22:12] Oreo huzky: The worst customer support on earth and very bad build quality
[2024-05-14T20:28:33] Face de Pin Suc√©: If you look on Rage Mechanics Website, you'll see that it says 21S with Regen and 22S without Regen
[2024-05-14T20:34:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: As you want to make it public, let's do it, we sold you 2 CL350, not C350, and you killed them, one of the two were already used so you got a discount. We used it and ran it without problem, and when you get these they died. We repaired for you, it took too much time yes I agree with you, but they were working well before sending you back, and we took as warranty. Then you burn again, I give you a solution to contact someone that I know is used to repair many many controllers with success. He even sent you a video of the controllers working before sending you back, then you killed AGAIN the controllers So MAYBE there is something wrong with your wiring/way to mount/use the controllers.
[2024-05-14T20:36:14] Face de Pin Suc√©: Oh by the way, this is C350 used with 22S battery at maximum power and speed when it is well installed with good wiring and setup : https://youtu.be/FIRvMWQFl6A?si=vBMyHZRGeKMrDW7K
[2024-05-14T20:36:24] Face de Pin Suc√©: https://youtu.be/o3etWunxhSM?si=LIAgx8zCEclRhIVO
[2024-05-14T20:38:00] Lisa: He killed them when he connected them via 12V power supply of I think wall power or something hahaha
[2024-05-14T20:43:58] rosheee: y0
[2024-05-14T20:43:59] Oreo huzky: No that‚Äôs the problem he didn‚Äôt repair one controller I paid 150‚Ç¨ and he send them broken back and and when I ask him about it he blames on bad wiring but I‚Äôve checked every cable and every cable was okay I even went as far to redo the complete wiring but he still seems to not care and I think a vesc that shows half voltage and makes motor stutter like hell and directly gives overcurrent is kinda strange and the other one died shortly after by just turning key ignite on and off twice and the customer support from 3shul is terrible wrote countless emails even called no response
[2024-05-14T20:44:22] rosheee: anyone has teh nami e-burn battery diameter?

[2024-05-14T20:45:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: Diameter of a battery ?
[2024-05-14T20:45:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: He sent you a video of the controllers working before sending back to you
[2024-05-14T20:46:58] rosheee: of the battery compartment teh pls ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2024-05-14T20:47:12] Face de Pin Suc√©: But

[2024-05-14T20:47:48] Oreo huzky: But on the video it wasn‚Äôt visible that the voltage readout is wrong which was the reason why is sent them in
[2024-05-14T20:48:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: Well I don't know, this part is not customer service as he is a standalone repair guy, but he knows what he does, he repaired me countless controllers of many brands
[2024-05-14T20:50:07] Oreo huzky: Well it seems like he dosent because he send them back broken wich either looks like shady business or he just dosent know
[2024-05-14T20:50:34] Oreo huzky: I‚Äòm sorry to be like that but that‚Äôs just how it is

[2024-05-15T02:49:36] cihan: Yes, there's a big difference but when one of them starts getting older in parallel to other, their resistance will equalize at one point.
[2024-05-15T02:50:04] haku: cool i did not know that
[2024-05-15T02:51:24] cihan: And it's not too big difference unless you'll use cells at limits, like 3C or more current continuously.

[2024-05-15T02:52:47] cihan: Which brand and model is 40t?

[2024-05-15T02:59:55] haku: it is great from what people saying. one of best high discharge 21700 cells

[2024-05-15T03:01:03] haku: or 40t similar to p42 in performance
[2024-05-15T03:01:37] cihan: I read many 18650 reviews on lygte but never read 21700 reviews before. I thought all good lithium cells were capped at 5C discharge. You changed my view to 21700 cells. üòç
[2024-05-15T03:05:31] cihan: P45b is really great, 50A for 4500 mAh is great. I wish they were cheaper. They're amazing for dual motors. But I think not really necessary for single motor if there's enough space for many cells. I saw p45b being sold for 4 euros each when you buy 200+. I would certainly buy if I could buy for that price.

[2024-05-15T13:53:00] sombre_enfant: Also 12in not allowed im fine, the mks 75200 will blow in a lap im chillin
[2024-05-15T13:54:02] haku: the first one is 11" i think these are 2 different g30s. different motors on the 12
[2024-05-15T13:55:48] haku: crazy the only one left is from the g30 is the frame. everything else is custom
[2024-05-15T13:55:49] sombre_enfant: Its xiaomi brother
[2024-05-15T13:56:08] sombre_enfant: The pole and stem are stock...
[2024-05-15T13:56:37] haku: oh dear lord! thats even more mind blowing

[2024-05-15T13:57:25] Denis Sebastien: Et pk √ßa
[2024-05-15T13:57:45] sombre_enfant: Its a ok build not worth doing it on a xiaomi, rear suspension really not needed its just weight issue... And i heard weird review from the guy supplying battery and lasercut part but not my business
[2024-05-15T13:58:25] sombre_enfant: But remember im #1 hater
[2024-05-15T13:58:43] Denis Sebastien: Exactement
[2024-05-15T13:58:57] haku: i have to give it to the french for these wild builds. but they still gay. its cool im not homophobe

[2024-05-15T14:19:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: 4p on those motors?
[2024-05-15T14:21:13] GABE: 180a? for 80h?
[2024-05-15T14:21:15] GABE: weird tbh
[2024-05-15T14:25:14] puneDir: <sticker>
[2024-05-15T14:42:58] GABE: oh god, thats an m365
[2024-05-15T14:43:06] GABE: how does that frame even power those motors??
[2024-05-15T14:45:26] haku: thoss are just teverun 50h motors
[2024-05-15T14:46:12] haku: the french one has the 80h. big dick motor
[2024-05-15T14:49:29] haku: where can you buy these lazer cut forks
[2024-05-15T14:58:58] sombre_enfant: Thats what im sayin
[2024-05-15T14:59:29] sombre_enfant: Orline be geekin, 50s also worse high discharge cells....
[2024-05-15T15:00:08] sombre_enfant: Orline guerre.... But its 5min design so i would do it myself but its shit...
[2024-05-15T15:06:41] haku: open the gates and show me where to find these my lord
[2024-05-15T15:21:28] Denis Sebastien: En fait ferme ta gueule on est l√† pour partager nos trucs j‚Äôaimerais bien savoir ce que toi tu as
[2024-05-15T15:27:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: Bon mon petit poulet, je vais le redire en fran√ßais pour toi, ceci est un canal de discussion en ANGLAIS, merci de parler en anglais Tu seras sympa √©galement de ne pas insulter les membres pr√©sents.

[2024-05-15T15:30:32] Denis Sebastien: Ok
[2024-05-15T15:31:53] GABE: 70h is big dick motor id say
[2024-05-15T15:32:11] GABE: so the teverun motors are 11 or 12 inch rim?

[2024-05-15T17:09:38] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Can someone recommend a motor temp sensor and explain how to wire it to the vesc ?
[2024-05-15T17:10:06] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I have one but I don't know the model I got it from random bms I found

[2024-05-15T17:12:41] Face de Pin Suc√©: Only one in Kelly, the others, all with VESC
[2024-05-15T17:13:49] Noname: Just No. So when you accelerate the rear pulls the shock open?
[2024-05-15T17:13:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yup, most of the others were running Spintend as far as I know
[2024-05-15T17:16:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: Nope, we have higher KV than the others üòÇ
[2024-05-15T17:16:20] Face de Pin Suc√©: Scooter capable of more than 170Kmh (need to do a proper road vmax test)

[2024-05-15T18:11:06] haku: drone camera?
[2024-05-15T18:44:25] Happy Giraffe: Aliexpress NTC 10K, wiring between hall ground and thermistor wire. Polarity of thermistor wires doesnt matter as its basically a resistor.
[2024-05-15T18:45:22] Face de Pin Suc√©: yess
[2024-05-15T18:45:30] Happy Giraffe: Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! ‚Ç¨0.99 12%OFF | 10PCS MF52B MF52D NTC Thermistor Thermal Resistor B3950 B3435 10K 100K Negative Temperature Control Sensor Probe Strap Wire https://a.aliexpress.com/_EwcBvsr
[2024-05-15T18:45:38] Happy Giraffe: Get the B3950 variant, works perfect for me
[2024-05-15T18:47:44] Happy Giraffe: You have longer period of higher torque this way if amps are not a problemüòâ
[2024-05-15T18:50:15] GABE: OK guess whose looking at 12' now jej
[2024-05-15T18:50:27] GABE: we going pimped out on this one.

[2024-05-15T19:03:18] Happy Giraffe: With FW thats insanely long torque range haha, competitors are propably like wtf how he continues to accelerate so long
[2024-05-15T19:03:46] Face de Pin Suc√©: We don't use FW x)
[2024-05-15T19:04:16] puneDir: M365 with shfw would beat all of that race scooters
[2024-05-15T19:16:24] Happy Giraffe: XiaoGen 13s with removed power limitüî•

[2024-05-15T21:21:16] Happy Giraffe: No idea, some giant scooter lol. I imagine the torque is off the roof
[2024-05-15T21:21:49] Happy Giraffe: Here you get the IPM benefits+reduction
[2024-05-15T21:22:12] Happy Giraffe: Should be insane torque
[2024-05-15T21:22:52] GABE: Looks neat. It kinda blends in.
[2024-05-15T21:23:15] GABE: Just need wires..
[2024-05-15T21:23:16] GABE: I can put an 11s here for the moment.
[2024-05-15T21:23:20] GABE: 9s can do
[2024-05-15T21:23:44] GABE: Easier than re welding into 20s
[2024-05-15T21:23:50] GABE: I could weld it into the original cell
[2024-05-15T21:23:55] GABE: tbh
[2024-05-15T21:24:01] GABE: Config would match cell count I just don't have any copper, or wires, or plugs ATM.
[2024-05-15T21:25:28] GABE: couldn't find zip ties to hold the ADC and ignition wire.
[2024-05-15T21:25:41] GABE: Wanted to go on a ride asap.
[2024-05-15T21:25:48] GABE: anyway it holds, so don't touch it.
[2024-05-15T21:26:14] Happy Giraffe: Electronics cant fit inside original batt space?
[2024-05-15T21:26:21] GABE: Wait I can fit them in a black box one above the other, 9s p42 + 8p mh1
[2024-05-15T21:26:29] GABE: This is ez and it won't look jank
[2024-05-15T21:26:51] GABE: Original cell box. 27ah it'll be.
[2024-05-15T21:27:54] GABE: Avoid welding rn
[2024-05-15T21:28:05] Happy Giraffe: Could just use a case in rear rack for one batt?
[2024-05-15T21:28:14] GABE: This cleaner
[2024-05-15T21:29:10] GABE: <photos/photo_15050@15-05-2024_21-29-10.jpg>
[2024-05-15T21:29:44] GABE: Enough space for 20s8p Moli tbh Not modding welds at all.
[2024-05-15T21:30:16] Happy Giraffe: One case in there would be nicer
[2024-05-15T21:30:24] GABE: what case?
[2024-05-15T21:30:27] GABE: Like a bag?
[2024-05-15T21:30:37] Happy Giraffe: Nah a harder maybe 3D printed
[2024-05-15T21:30:48] GABE: This might not look shit cause it blends with it
[2024-05-15T21:31:06] Happy Giraffe: Splitting batt into two is not a good idea, james surely has made some points about it in the pastüòÅ
[2024-05-15T21:31:08] GABE: And the original cell case illl cut to size
[2024-05-15T21:31:15] GABE: Nah me n James planned my whole pro 2 that way. The BMS is 9s + 11s, one 20s BMS.
[2024-05-15T21:31:34] GABE: Just need huge ass thick wires, and double copper iron/nickel, because of restricted electron flow.
[2024-05-15T21:32:23] GABE: Double, or tri 6awg,
[2024-05-15T21:33:47] GABE: Anyway, I'm not even doing that setup now, I've moved to the G30 lol. So 10s12p double sandwich it'll be.
[2024-05-15T21:33:47] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-05-15T21:41:33] haku: you modding a folding ebike. those frames are sketch. i have one too
[2024-05-15T21:42:03] GABE: The rear is fine with upkeep, also I need to find a washer for it,
[2024-05-15T21:42:09] GABE: Aka, same BMS.
[2024-05-15T21:42:16] GABE: ANT the legend
[2024-05-15T21:43:17] GABE: Of course!! and if not, calculate the smaller cells power.
[2024-05-15T21:43:24] haku: i wouldnt trust the welds on the folding mechanism. i thought about modding mine qs205
[2024-05-15T21:43:28] GABE: amp bat u mean
[2024-05-15T21:46:35] GABE: Perhaps cause they try sync and fail, I used 20s 10s for ages and was fine.
[2024-05-15T21:46:50] GABE: Perhaps charging batt charge wrong.
[2024-05-15T21:47:35] GABE: Soldering
[2024-05-15T21:47:39] GABE: Dies on charge
[2024-05-15T21:48:05] GABE: Yeah I feel it's cheap skating anyway,
[2024-05-15T21:48:13] GABE: true
[2024-05-15T21:48:34] GABE: I was thinking about this yesterday tbh, how can 72v travel thru 2x 36v components, there would be fluctuations as well cause of the MOSFET waves dat turn shit on and off at millisecond delays, which is enough to cause a blow? No esc is 100% equal tbh lol
[2024-05-15T21:54:14] GABE: OMFG, Amazon tried charging me 70, then 30 later. but I have no history of such an account. I checked my 20 accs to make sure
[2024-05-15T21:54:14] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-05-15T22:00:03] GABE: I blew mine cause I wires + to + to - - on the BMS charge lol
[2024-05-15T22:00:09] GABE: Skill issue
[2024-05-15T22:05:00] cihan: I asked since you told you wanted to buy molicel p45b for 2 USD each.
[2024-05-15T22:07:47] haku: i bought 40t from trusted seller 3.85 ea on black friday sale

[2024-05-15T22:10:46] haku: normally they retail for p42 price in the US wich is 4.50 a cell when buying 150
[2024-05-15T22:12:37] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: 1- One battery per motors 2- 80H on light v√©hicule 3- 20S 4P to run 80H are 3 good trigger warning to know it's not true about "tout a bien √©t√© √©tudi√©"
[2024-05-15T22:20:47] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: For performance and balanced config it should be better to use like 70H Speed motors on rear and ligher 110*50H on front or something like that with a 20S battery for exemple, and about the two separated battery it have not any sens, it's just worst to any points. Even a 110*70H motors are still very big for 20S4P battery but so why not for performance use 80H on this is like to have Full prepared engine block with the OEM Injector size and about Flipsky... i will not comment everyone know.
[2024-05-15T22:24:07] haku: hes more american than french. bigger is better üòÇ
[2024-05-15T22:26:10] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Yes, Efficiency are not existing üòÜ
[2024-05-15T22:27:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: I read somewhere that they come with Light scooter to be better that our racing scooter üòèüòè
[2024-05-15T22:29:26] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Not any performant and reliable config, but some guys yes, like the ppl who think every vesc are same üòÜ
[2024-05-15T22:30:03] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: And they change it at every race üòÇ
[2024-05-15T22:32:12] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Others guys prefer to use a Big Fripsky Fridge on side of his Scooter, like that the maximum angle to turn are 5¬∞ üòÜ
[2024-05-15T22:34:46] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Yes it's that, to push probably something like 200A
[2024-05-15T22:35:08] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: When we push real 400 with 12 mos
[2024-05-15T22:38:33] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: not, i was talking of an G30 with Orline custom ppl told me
[2024-05-15T22:39:50] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: https://youtu.be/Tdo8gl-9Cmw?si=WDJlnJvyfLrjg8lE&t=346
[2024-05-15T22:40:27] haku: that guy has 75h in rear and 50h front yea?
[2024-05-15T22:40:36] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: I dont know
[2024-05-15T22:42:58] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: But the best Light Scooter on weight Cat√©gory are made by Jess Oul, a nice Switzerland, he made crazy less than 38kg powerfull scooter based on Dualtron compact and good choice of motor combinaison and battery and Carbon parts
[2024-05-15T22:44:48] haku: for track im sure. but maybe for joy riding in the steets these wild builds will do.
[2024-05-15T22:46:23] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Maybe, but from 0 Using 80H on this are just not intelligent, for Track or even worst to riding on street to have fun
[2024-05-15T22:48:58] haku: agreed. 80h would make sense on a really big scooter that has more battery space
[2024-05-15T22:49:18] haku: can any vesc power that 80h?
[2024-05-15T22:50:04] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Even on big scooter it can be is totally sutpid too, for exemple i had 75H in my last track race and i won front of some guys in 80H
[2024-05-15T22:51:04] haku: its all about the tune too. you know what you are doing.
[2024-05-15T22:51:13] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: And that's with 22S, if you got 20S i will not recommand bigger than 70H
[2024-05-15T22:51:18] haku: and driver skill ofcourse
[2024-05-15T22:51:26] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: By the way, i also won a drag race with double 70H vs double 80H ...
[2024-05-15T22:52:34] haku: if i build a moped it will be this motor.
[2024-05-15T22:53:04] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: For the Drag race it doesn't have influence that and for the Race, the others guys with 80h are at same level and even better than me
[2024-05-15T22:53:24] Franchesco Carofano: I did some work there and that's it, friend, thank God everything is fine now.
[2024-05-15T22:53:36] Franchesco Carofano: <photos/photo_15054@15-05-2024_22-53-36.jpg>
[2024-05-15T22:55:38] haku: axiom üòÅ
[2024-05-15T22:55:51] haku: where can you even buy that haha
[2024-05-15T22:56:03] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: why that ?
[2024-05-15T22:57:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: There's many vesc
[2024-05-15T22:57:39] Franchesco Carofano: The can bus from new were broken, so I configured the tronic separately, of course, each one with the same accelerator and then when everything was ready, one has a positive negative signal, in the other only a negative signal and they work perfectly, so that's what ae You can do if not change the components of the can bus and that's it but that's basically it
[2024-05-15T22:58:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ah if you need over power it then make sense
[2024-05-15T22:58:45] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: But the Wire i see can't handle that current, i loose something ?
[2024-05-15T22:59:04] haku: thats the thing fardriver is so crude but its powerful unfortunately
[2024-05-15T22:59:29] haku: brute power
[2024-05-15T22:59:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: There's 2 wire per phase in parallel
[2024-05-15T22:59:43] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: like double 6 awg ?
[2024-05-15T22:59:45] Franchesco Carofano: tronic's solution was to send the product back and wait longer. They did not want to return the money until they saw what happened but I am not willing to waste any more time.
[2024-05-15T22:59:54] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Ash yes ok üòÜthat can handle much current
[2024-05-15T23:00:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: 2x3awg if I'm not wrong

[2024-05-15T23:05:43] Franchesco Carofano: The 3 pins are connected to one of the controllers and only signal and ground to the other.
[2024-05-15T23:06:31] Franchesco Carofano: Well, of course it works, the problem is when you link the currents, that is, you connect the 3.3 vol of one and 3.3 of the other, there you do shit and burn the accelerator.

[2024-05-15T23:26:34] haku: its crazy how all the best emoto scooter motors come from china. why doesnt the west try to produce thier own?
[2024-05-15T23:27:15] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: no it's just question of KV and battery voltage
[2024-05-15T23:27:20] haku: china is leading the world in electric.

[2024-05-16T03:20:47] Rogerio Figueiredo: Maybe I should remove phase amps and do battery amps or field weakening
[2024-05-16T03:25:07] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Depends on your body

[2024-05-16T03:52:11] JPPL: Agree, thanks
[2024-05-16T06:12:21] GABE: Yeah, but it'll do cause G30s are rare
[2024-05-16T06:12:29] GABE: g30 will be peaked out.
[2024-05-16T09:56:03] Rogerio Figueiredo: That is not the problem
[2024-05-16T09:56:24] Rogerio Figueiredo: The problem is the space you waste on that layout

[2024-05-16T13:40:57] Thierry: If I can help
[2024-05-16T14:02:49] cihan: Does utilizing 21700 battery instead of 18650 for the same capacity generate less heat because there are less battery connections? Or is it negligible difference?
[2024-05-16T14:57:31] GABE: Will be helping @nosoudoppi get the 2 scooters in order as soon as I arrive üëÄ

[2024-05-16T20:41:19] haku: same thing on @roscheeee video
[2024-05-16T21:03:36] haku: this is new. what is that?

[2024-05-16T21:19:57] Noname: What motor?
[2024-05-16T21:20:45] Noname: I want a sleeper again. 2 stock motors or 1wd you like better?
[2024-05-16T21:22:03] GABE: 2 motors blend in nice.
[2024-05-16T21:23:52] Noname: Last time I was playing thinking machine a new axle and pop a rear in the front. Could use a fwd ninebot caps or whole front end assembly off an F series

[2024-05-16T21:32:44] Happy Giraffe: Heat generation is immense on thoseüòÖ Ofc stress is higher with bigger tyre but they are so useless lol
[2024-05-16T21:33:23] Happy Giraffe: I cant imagine how a smaller "1500w" motor performs lmao
[2024-05-16T21:34:45] Happy Giraffe: I think also problem being same motor is used in 20" and 29" wheels. 29 could take a motor with much larger diameter so more leverage and more space to fill copperü§î

[2024-05-16T22:54:03] cihan: Those are great prices. 21700 cells from known brands are all overpriced in Turkey.

[2024-05-17T00:29:00] haku: k6 seems like a stable machine. ive heard you can steer it with your legs
[2024-05-17T00:29:05] Noname: Use your head I almost crashed the other day lol. 2nd scare
[2024-05-17T00:29:16] Noname: No
[2024-05-17T00:30:24] Noname: Need to take hand brakes off regen and do lights only.
[2024-05-17T00:30:35] Happy Giraffe: He busy printing PokemonsüòÇ
[2024-05-17T00:31:24] haku: i still have 148 to go
[2024-05-17T00:31:45] Noname: Panic stop I hit disc brakes and they dirty cause I stopped using them. Came into a corner overly hot and did a pivit turn off dirt bank like a motocross rider.
[2024-05-17T00:32:26] haku: dam. good thing you did not fall
[2024-05-17T00:32:51] Noname: Would have flown into a tree and bush
[2024-05-17T00:35:10] Noname: Passed my euc friend like 40 into this corner
[2024-05-17T00:38:13] haku: thats another sketch ride. eucs
[2024-05-17T00:47:46] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: As far as I know, no, it is updated to version 6.2
[2024-05-17T00:49:06] Noname: Yeah I'm good
[2024-05-17T00:50:33] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: <photos/photo_15074@17-05-2024_00-50-33.jpg>
[2024-05-17T00:52:36] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: I have tried to perform the detection manually and the motor moves a little and the error appears, I don't know what it could be, I have restored all the values and only one of the controllers fails.
[2024-05-17T00:57:36] haku: those things are like 130v or something too
[2024-05-17T00:57:54] Noname: 134
[2024-05-17T00:57:55] haku: like k6
[2024-05-17T00:58:12] haku: do you know what esc the k6 use?
[2024-05-17T00:58:14] Noname: He scared to race me now
[2024-05-17T00:58:23] Noname: Begode shit
[2024-05-17T00:58:30] haku: i see.
[2024-05-17T01:02:18] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: I disassembled the controller to clean it, it had been placed outside and some dust got in. When I reassembled it and connected the motors, I performed the motor detection and that's when the error occurred. Could dust have caused the problem?
[2024-05-17T01:05:29] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: Do you know what component can cause the problem?
[2024-05-17T01:13:51] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: If it were a mosfet, shouldn't the motor run stuck when connected? Is what happened normal?
[2024-05-17T01:21:07] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: I have disassembled it to check the pcb and at first glance nothing can be seen burnt, as you have mentioned it could be a strange failure in the mosfets...
[2024-05-17T01:36:10] haku: this module was made a few months ago. how long can i store these cells?
[2024-05-17T01:52:55] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: That component seems to have broken or desoldered, the quality of the welds is quite bad from what I see. Surely that is the problem, I don't know what function it has but imagine that it will be used to control a phase of the motor and that is why the error occurs.
[2024-05-17T01:58:18] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: yes, looking at the reference it is an a6 diode
[2024-05-17T02:14:56] Noname: You only have 1 month to use the batterys. Otherwise the orbit of earth skews out of alignment and we all die. Save the planet and ride a scooter
[2024-05-17T02:20:26] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: I'm looking but I can't find a published schematic of the ubox v2 100/100 but I'm sure that's the problem. Maybe someone in the group has the diagram and can clear up any doubts.
[2024-05-17T02:36:22] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: I have ordered replacement diodes, When they arrive I will solder it and check if that is the problem, I hope so.
[2024-05-17T04:10:06] GABE: years upon years in a refrigerator.
[2024-05-17T04:10:20] GABE: slows down chemical reactions psst
[2024-05-17T04:23:53] haku: what cold kills batteries
[2024-05-17T04:24:37] haku: i live in a hot dry climate. im a fire type pokemon
[2024-05-17T04:34:37] Noname: Using battery in cold not storing.
[2024-05-17T04:35:30] Noname: You slow them down then abuse them in a cold car etc. Otherwise they be just chillin in a fridge.
[2024-05-17T04:40:04] haku: <photos/photo_15077@17-05-2024_04-40-04.jpg>
[2024-05-17T04:40:20] haku: poor fella
[2024-05-17T05:16:00] Noname: Never good when the face shield is detached from helmet
[2024-05-17T05:30:30] haku: thess things are difficult to drive yea?
[2024-05-17T05:57:11] Noname: Harleys? Na just the 900lbs and stupid driving position.
[2024-05-17T06:03:35] Noname: https://youtu.be/ipDmsxQVxIM?feature=shared
[2024-05-17T06:28:07] haku: this is hilarious. i have a neighbor like this. same german helmet too
[2024-05-17T06:28:57] haku: i do like the new electric harley though
[2024-05-17T06:31:17] haku: i wish emotos got rid of the gastank look. no purpose for that bulge
[2024-05-17T08:38:01] GABE: Can do this with a pit bike frame
[2024-05-17T09:17:48] Happy Giraffe: I really dont understand why emotos are so trash, just need an efficient gearing until 100mph topspeed for a regular bike and a big battery...add good aerodynamics and then you have an actually usable bike
[2024-05-17T09:35:27] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: The diode's solder pins are missing, it seems like they cracked and I don't know if it would hold the board well. In the afternoon I will try to see if it can be fixed easily.
[2024-05-17T12:24:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You are on Android 10?
[2024-05-17T12:25:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Hope you dont have bank apps on it ,if yes jesus

[2024-05-17T12:43:35] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: And if it does do need to switch phases also ?
[2024-05-17T12:56:07] Rose: Hey there B, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-05-17T13:41:02] Wolve666: Why?
[2024-05-17T14:20:37] NetworkDir: Security issues
[2024-05-17T14:31:47] Mihail: It seems to be on the power supply pin for the gate driver. It should be safe to bridge it. What is written on the driver? EG3112?
[2024-05-17T14:52:17] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: Yes, the reference is that. I have tried to look for a local spare part but I can't find it and I will have to check on Aliexpress with the wait that entails. The option of bridging the connection may be an option but I don't know if it can be harmful in the long run.
[2024-05-17T15:18:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yap , should not even use that bank what let's use that üòÖ
[2024-05-17T18:31:09] Rose: Hey there B, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-05-17T18:31:48] Tan Sean: Hello i am a beginner, how do i know how much amps run through my phase wires?
[2024-05-17T18:57:02] GABE: Just assume half current
[2024-05-17T20:19:37] Happy Giraffe: Theres the motor and controller limit in addition to phase wire limit. Usually motor overheats first of these

[2024-05-18T04:33:58] haku: fardriver though üò≠
[2024-05-18T04:37:35] Noname: <sticker>
[2024-05-18T04:38:31] Noname: Laotia has a battery.
[2024-05-18T04:38:41] Noname: It's on your shelf
[2024-05-18T04:39:12] Noname: You have to pay a reoccurring fee to use fardriver app
[2024-05-18T04:41:15] haku: what? its free i think
[2024-05-18T04:41:32] Noname: Idk my friend has one he complains about it
[2024-05-18T04:42:29] haku: i know. but its just brute power.
[2024-05-18T04:42:49] Noname: Thought you didn't like that
[2024-05-18T04:44:26] haku: fardriver is like tge flipskys of esc i think. cheap crap but it works
[2024-05-18T04:45:54] Noname: I'd rather stick to one. But I can't replace my 24f Nuc so 2 it is.
[2024-05-18T04:46:04] haku: scooters will be vesc. but the emoto/emoped dream will be different
[2024-05-18T04:47:02] Noname: Just make it 2wd
[2024-05-18T04:47:06] haku: its just a dream for now haha
[2024-05-18T04:47:26] haku: too many dreams but it never comes into reality
[2024-05-18T04:48:56] Noname: Finish one. I have dead projects from starting to much stuff. Rc lawnmower/ unfinished house/ Austin powers truck/ blown up dirt bike. You get overwhelmed and go broke.
[2024-05-18T04:59:50] haku: i wish spintend would make a emoto vesc. that would turn heads and introduce vesc into that community
[2024-05-18T05:00:08] Noname: What's the Max power now
[2024-05-18T05:00:35] haku: fardriver theres a 2600a one

[2024-05-18T05:02:52] Noname: <animation>
[2024-05-18T05:03:29] Noname: But let's be serious
[2024-05-18T05:03:47] Noname: What can you afford to build and what do you have the balls to drive
[2024-05-18T05:04:16] haku: 3shul and bac is double the price
[2024-05-18T05:04:41] Noname: You haven't gone past stock laioti power yet?
[2024-05-18T05:05:44] Noname: 14kw pulls like a train. I want more but it's plenty to have fun
[2024-05-18T05:06:41] Noname: 20kw is getting into terrifying and unusable wheel spin
[2024-05-18T05:07:35] haku: nope. just switched to vesc
[2024-05-18T05:07:50] Noname: Did you power it on yet?
[2024-05-18T05:07:51] haku: thats why seated is safer
[2024-05-18T05:08:02] haku: yes. thats my old setup
[2024-05-18T05:08:21] rosheee: anyone want segway g2 frame like brand new?

[2024-05-18T05:08:28] rosheee: with stem and stuff?
[2024-05-18T05:09:03] Noname: Safe were rolling on 11" or 279.4mm tires from China doing 50+mph or 80km/h
[2024-05-18T05:10:51] haku: free shipping to US?
[2024-05-18T05:11:13] rosheee: no but cheap i check but it is frame and everything without electronics and with monorim

[2024-05-18T05:12:55] Noname: @Bradhaku See finish one then dream more
[2024-05-18T05:13:07] rosheee: ?
[2024-05-18T05:13:23] Noname: He doesn't finish just adds more to plate
[2024-05-18T05:13:35] Noname: Motivation
[2024-05-18T05:13:42] Noname: Go Haku Go
[2024-05-18T05:14:46] Noname: I want to see a Chinese man on a Chinese scooter cruising the good Ole USA
[2024-05-18T05:18:55] haku: chinaman is the right word sir
[2024-05-18T05:20:40] Noname: <photos/photo_15082@18-05-2024_05-20-40.jpg>
[2024-05-18T05:22:10] rosheee: never steering damper
[2024-05-18T05:23:48] rosheee: come üòÜlet's go
[2024-05-18T05:23:52] haku: lmao
[2024-05-18T06:25:21] Mihail: If anything, it would work better without the diode. They placed it to prevent noise from getting into the 12v rail, which is a bad idea, as it limits the current available to the gate driver.
[2024-05-18T07:45:52] haku: what the heck is this milwaukee. https://youtube.com/shorts/HEySVLMEHnU?si=u5_VZYCnQjUdFhSs
[2024-05-18T07:50:10] Rose: Hey there B, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-05-18T11:48:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: One of my mate/customer videos , He is a food delivery guy, under all weather üòÅü§£
[2024-05-18T11:48:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: <video_file>
[2024-05-18T11:49:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: @Happy_Giraffe engine keeps going in rain still üòÅ
[2024-05-18T13:28:50] Thierry: Wahou, is it in Hungary?
[2024-05-18T13:49:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: How did you know?

[2024-05-18T14:25:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: ?
[2024-05-18T14:55:44] Thierry: You said once that you are from Hungary
[2024-05-18T15:22:24] Happy Giraffe: Yeah submarine activities
[2024-05-18T15:22:49] Happy Giraffe: Typical day in DenmarküòÇ
[2024-05-18T15:23:00] haku: sleeper bro
[2024-05-18T15:24:06] haku: thats the ninebot frame i want. how many cells fit that?
[2024-05-18T15:24:29] Happy Giraffe: Damn, it's only as sleeper as it's riderüòÅ if using full face helmet it gives it awayüåö
[2024-05-18T15:25:12] Happy Giraffe: Pls dont, atleast get a skating helmet
[2024-05-18T15:25:41] Happy Giraffe: Haha
[2024-05-18T15:29:44] haku: get a skateboard helmet.
[2024-05-18T15:30:12] haku: that looks better and lighter anyways
[2024-05-18T15:36:08] haku: can you fit a dual ubox on those frames?
[2024-05-18T15:40:59] NetworkDir: 21700?
[2024-05-18T15:41:08] NetworkDir: 18650 120-130cells possible
[2024-05-18T16:23:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: That's true
[2024-05-18T17:23:23] Noname: Super sleepy
[2024-05-18T22:50:19] Yamal: the King on a single scooter with little discharge
[2024-05-18T22:51:30] Noname: Smart enough not to get it confiscated
[2024-05-18T22:53:01] Yamal: that's why he is the King of Kings
[2024-05-18T22:53:59] Yamal: They happen in some European countries with e-scooters.
[2024-05-18T22:54:50] Yamal: Let's see if they turn the tables a little and regulate history in our favor.
[2024-05-18T23:08:41] haku: dam sitting in a office chair for hours fucked my back. i cant even squat.
[2024-05-18T23:09:22] haku: pinched nerve is a mofo
[2024-05-18T23:09:53] Yamal: https://youtu.be/qe_xsG-WYmA?si=fMnftm6YjZ1K4FKX
[2024-05-18T23:13:36] Yamal: you work in an office with a computer
[2024-05-18T23:18:33] haku: no. i was dissasembling stuff sitting down
[2024-05-18T23:20:21] Martin Kaktits: Heyo. Im using 6.05 beta with lisp scrip for g30 dash. The new 6.05 has odometer saving feature. I wanted to turn it off, but, looks like, the script still makes it save the odometer anyway. I was told it might be a problem in the long run as the memory chips not designed for super many writes?
[2024-05-18T23:30:00] Yamal: Have a good vacation with your e-scooter!
[2024-05-18T23:32:49] haku: hows your simgle motor scooter doing? fixed it?
[2024-05-18T23:35:06] Yamal: Well, to be exact, yesterday I ordered the new components through Alliespress, and they will arrive in a week, those that were supposedly good, but they weren't, so there's nothing to wait for...
[2024-05-18T23:35:49] haku: what is broken?
[2024-05-18T23:37:05] Yamal: I'm looking forward to going with the 2 controllers, the heat sink is doing a phenomenal job with just one controller, I take it every day to go to work and some occasional routes on the weekend,, but poor Nami goes at half throttle,,
[2024-05-18T23:37:53] haku: just get a spintend and go dual again
[2024-05-18T23:37:56] Yamal: I showed it weeks ago that there are some square components that have to do with the motor phase and apparently it is the one that most often breaks..!
[2024-05-18T23:37:57] haku: 12 fet
[2024-05-18T23:38:17] haku: oh thats right
[2024-05-18T23:38:42] Yamal: No money man !üòÇ only can wait for my good /gold little Focer !
[2024-05-19T00:00:22] Yamal: In the end you are going to get me to come to the USA to help you prepare your scooter without having any idea about itüòÇ
[2024-05-19T00:18:40] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: The script does not and cannot write the odometer data. It is an option in VESC, if that does not work, report to vedderb.
[2024-05-19T00:19:27] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But you should not worry too much about memory wear because the times it can write is still high enough.
[2024-05-19T00:19:41] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Nop, no writes.
[2024-05-19T00:21:56] Yamal: send an email to Benjamin!!! and invite him to the group. If not, I'll send it to you! Tell him that he doesn't need to write, that just reading is enough!
[2024-05-19T00:29:58] Yamal: https://youtu.be/YHsPncLy5u8?feature=shared
[2024-05-19T00:30:46] Yamal: Without this man, we would not be here talking today...
[2024-05-19T00:47:30] Happy Giraffe: The amount of shitposts that are here, I would be shamed if I he cameüòÖ
[2024-05-19T00:49:11] Yamal: nothing happens, he is also human
[2024-05-19T00:49:59] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Motor doesn't stop running after throttle stops only when filed weakening is on (75100 Battery on 30a if it matters)
[2024-05-19T00:50:20] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I need to know a fix
[2024-05-19T00:52:46] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: So on ground no problem?
[2024-05-19T00:53:27] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Ok will test tomorrow thanks üôèüëç
[2024-05-19T00:53:43] Happy Giraffe: I would prefer an organized report from thw group about firmware issues and new wanted features made from a single guy. Then he would only have to use that little time. Would be less of a mess
[2024-05-19T01:01:33] Happy Giraffe: One combined raport monthly from our findings on what works and what doesnt would be best imo
[2024-05-19T01:01:57] Happy Giraffe: We would have the time to gather all data of the situation so its not the type "Scooter wont run help pls"
[2024-05-19T01:02:10] Yamal: Let me locate it, if I can get it to join the group you can prepare me some x12, for about c350, I'll leave the spintends to you!!!
[2024-05-19T01:02:41] Happy Giraffe: Locate what?üòÖ
[2024-05-19T01:13:03] Yamal: I mean contact him
[2024-05-19T01:16:34] Happy Giraffe: I dont see him having time to chat or even read the chat, hes a busy man
[2024-05-19T01:16:36] Yamal: as the donkey from SHREK says. where will he be?
[2024-05-19T01:21:19] haku: i dont even comment on the vesc discord. i just listen. the stuff they talk about there is a different language
[2024-05-19T01:24:07] haku: the @roscheeee curry vesc comment iss epic though
[2024-05-19T01:26:52] Yamal: Where ?
[2024-05-19T01:30:22] haku: discord
[2024-05-19T01:31:23] Yamal: I have no idea, what are some forums about vesc on the internet?
[2024-05-19T01:33:27] haku: vedder has a youtube yea?
[2024-05-19T01:34:47] Yamal: <photos/photo_15083@19-05-2024_01-34-47.jpg>
[2024-05-19T01:35:43] Yamal: good place to write to the lion!!
[2024-05-19T01:36:39] Yamal: Let's see if I can send you the first invitation letter in a while xD
[2024-05-19T01:38:00] Yamal: I pasted the group link, right? ü§£
[2024-05-19T01:38:32] haku: the youtube is great. lots to learn
[2024-05-19T02:07:47] haku: recycled pla. i turned it into a dildo. i guess you can melt and mold this stuff
[2024-05-19T02:08:50] haku: ill save all the junk prints. and make some art
[2024-05-19T02:19:23] Finn: Why its brown on the topüò≠
[2024-05-19T02:21:09] haku: i did some testing for rigidity
[2024-05-19T02:21:16] Finn: Bruh
[2024-05-19T02:21:25] Finn: <sticker>
[2024-05-19T02:24:15] Noname: @Bradhaku U 1 weird dude üòÜ
[2024-05-19T04:15:28] Ion: Yooo, it turned out nice. And 20S all without spacer?
[2024-05-19T10:17:21] rosheee: Iz not a g30
[2024-05-19T10:18:28] GABE: Kek
[2024-05-19T10:37:01] GABE: Lmao
[2024-05-19T11:28:39] rosheee: Rear esc
[2024-05-19T11:33:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: Your handlebar is wayyyyy too high, like 20cm too high at least so yes you can't keep it down
[2024-05-19T11:40:28] Yamal: And another question in itself is, why not dual motors? more playful...
[2024-05-19T11:41:32] Yamal: Rear?
[2024-05-19T11:41:38] rosheee: yes
[2024-05-19T11:41:41] rosheee: front wheel spins
[2024-05-19T11:41:45] rosheee: then couple kmh more
[2024-05-19T11:41:55] Yamal: X12?
[2024-05-19T11:41:59] rosheee: no g30
[2024-05-19T11:42:02] rosheee: x12 goes faster
[2024-05-19T11:42:57] Yamal: That's your g 30 with the ubox..?
[2024-05-19T11:43:04] rosheee: yes my 20s g30
[2024-05-19T11:44:53] Yamal: and the gt2, how about the x12, I'm a little disoriented about it, first you say that you mount them, then you say that you replace them with the 85/150, that you prefer them, then you show some screenshot of vesc tool in which the x12 appear, I mean very lost
[2024-05-19T11:45:06] rosheee: XD U KNOW JOKES?
[2024-05-19T11:45:18] rosheee: in gt2 i mounted the X12's
[2024-05-19T11:45:19] Yamal: Yes
[2024-05-19T11:45:30] rosheee: the 85150 can't handle 110v peak
[2024-05-19T11:45:59] rosheee: üòÉ
[2024-05-19T11:46:21] Yamal: Have you been able to test the gt2 "well"?
[2024-05-19T11:46:43] rosheee: have to bleed the front brake and i'm not at home for next couple days
[2024-05-19T11:46:46] rosheee: but it runs
[2024-05-19T11:47:45] Yamal: You're right, I never thought about that, novice things. ^^'
[2024-05-19T11:47:53] rosheee: XD novice üòÉ
[2024-05-19T11:48:08] Yamal: üë∫
[2024-05-19T11:50:13] Yamal: Well, nothing, we are waiting to see what the real x12 gives you, because there is very little information about them working today, very new, very expensive and with the best mosfets ever and yet to be on the market!
[2024-05-19T11:50:37] Yamal: üî´
[2024-05-19T11:51:59] rosheee: first data i send to tronic ah and have to place the cooling correct
[2024-05-19T12:15:11] Yamal: And is it stable at 135kmh? If on a large scooter going 130 kmh is already "impressive" I don't want to imagine going on a g30 XD, since your feet are on very little platform
[2024-05-19T12:25:35] rosheee: yes
[2024-05-19T12:25:52] rosheee: seems like i get overcurrent on rear esc @ 320A phase
[2024-05-19T12:28:19] Yamal: you go with 20s6p right?
[2024-05-19T12:29:31] rosheee: yes
[2024-05-19T12:29:38] rosheee: 20s9p would be nice
[2024-05-19T12:29:40] rosheee: cuz battery rly sad
[2024-05-19T12:29:56] Yamal: James should set up something like this, discreet, without many lights, but let him run and he can enjoy
[2024-05-19T12:30:10] rosheee: ?
[2024-05-19T12:30:52] Yamal: a lot of power for the small battery you mean,,!? but I don't see much voltage drop either..
[2024-05-19T12:31:46] Yamal: I mean that a g30 could be mounted at that level of performance to enjoy more...
[2024-05-19T12:32:39] rosheee: u need external 3P for 9P ;-(
[2024-05-19T12:34:02] Yamal: backpacks are not cool....
[2024-05-19T12:36:41] Finn: Thats fucking sick
[2024-05-19T12:37:03] Yamal: The frame of the g 30 gives what it gives,,,I understand that you are in love with the brand,, but if you want more capacity, go to the gt2, look for another frame,, or make one to your taste,,:‚Ç¨
[2024-05-19T12:37:07] Finn: No display?
[2024-05-19T12:37:26] rosheee: me on max of GT2 as well atm
[2024-05-19T12:37:32] rosheee: with smaller bms maybe 27S but with the new cells i need kinda same bms like now..so 26S or bms on top then 27s MAYBE...
[2024-05-19T12:37:46] Finn: That fits in there?
[2024-05-19T12:37:49] Finn: Looks so small
[2024-05-19T12:38:28] Finn: Is that snsc 2.3?
[2024-05-19T12:38:50] Yamal: Why 26 and not 22 is the question?xDD
[2024-05-19T12:39:13] rosheee: why 22?
[2024-05-19T12:39:48] rosheee: 26S8P i have 32-33Ah and 560-700A battery
[2024-05-19T12:41:54] Yamal: I say 22s, because that's what everyone rides, heh what is your cell?
[2024-05-19T12:43:01] Yamal: I'll tell you more, I've also heard here that 22s is better than 24s....
[2024-05-19T12:50:24] NetworkDir: 26s and 560A crazy
[2024-05-19T12:52:07] rosheee: should do 560A cont. but we will see then
[2024-05-19T12:52:12] rosheee: still waiting for cells
[2024-05-19T12:53:22] NetworkDir: What motors you using ? Stock gt2?
[2024-05-19T12:53:46] rosheee: for now yes see what's possible with them ^^' dulitsky did 142 i think with them
[2024-05-19T12:53:57] rosheee: and 22s so maybe they go bit faster with 26s
[2024-05-19T12:54:47] NetworkDir: For your b current i think you need trampa str500 + 90H motors with ferrofluid XD
[2024-05-19T12:55:04] Jan: Technical limitation would be ~ 160kmh
[2024-05-19T12:55:40] NetworkDir: Actually +150km/h is enough for scooter
[2024-05-19T12:55:56] NetworkDir: GT2 geometry should fine for max 180kmh
[2024-05-19T12:56:20] Jan: Probably the best high speed geometry out there
[2024-05-19T12:57:34] Face de Pin Suc√©: ??
[2024-05-19T12:57:37] NetworkDir: Inmotion rs looks good but i scare about aerodynamic
[2024-05-19T12:58:32] Jan: Power requirements to overcome drag equation
[2024-05-19T12:59:14] Jan: This is what the battery pack and controller can deliver
[2024-05-19T12:59:36] Jan: ~ 34-35kW
[2024-05-19T13:01:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: but 26S 500+A is more than 34-35KW
[2024-05-19T13:01:06] rosheee: Letz see what these x12 can do
[2024-05-19T13:01:13] rosheee: Battery yes
[2024-05-19T13:01:38] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's like 46+KW possible
[2024-05-19T13:01:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: if X12 cannot handle that at that price, I don't understand
[2024-05-19T13:02:33] rosheee: We will see xD But i am using the 24S x12s
[2024-05-19T13:37:28] Yamal: In the end we are becoming more demanding and we want the perfect machine: -lots of top speed -lots of torque - good geometry -high discharge and capacity cells -that we can do great routes with it and be able to enter the circuit -that it weighs little for everyday use or in case you have to lift it to climb a staircase -and a long etc...
[2024-05-19T13:51:02] rosheee: rly wanna test the 16s on track ^^
[2024-05-19T14:02:41] Yamal: ^^' x) üòÇ
[2024-05-19T14:04:36] Yamal: in the end to try, you can try whatever you want, a stock Xiaomi is sure to be able to go around the track
[2024-05-19T14:16:36] rosheee: the 16s isn't slow btw
[2024-05-19T14:35:20] Yamal: Well yes, a stock Thunder is 16s and is around 80/85 km/h, without doing anything at all..
[2024-05-19T14:36:46] Face de Pin Suc√©: Then come
[2024-05-19T14:37:03] Face de Pin Suc√©: Next weekend, track in France man

[2024-05-19T14:40:29] rosheee: yes nice g30 16s with vsett motors doing more ^^' and 12.5kw cont. and 14kw peak so far üòú and 10" + cheaper and lighter ^^ and no need of steeringdamper ^^ sry being such a 1 sided fanboi
[2024-05-19T14:44:33] rosheee: btw anyone know the axle dropout of a dualtron 3?

[2024-05-19T14:58:23] Yamal: It's a Spanish saying
[2024-05-19T14:58:40] Yamal: Moto is motorcycle
[2024-05-19T14:59:06] rosheee: Ah xD nah i never tried to sell the frame or any of their productz
[2024-05-19T14:59:43] Yamal: when they talk very well to you about something: we sometimes say: Aren't you trying to sell us the moto?
[2024-05-19T15:03:55] Yamal: JOKE? XD
[2024-05-19T15:08:53] rosheee: Ok xD

[2024-05-19T21:53:30] NetworkDir: no i don't get wobble but scooter can't feel me stability and security
[2024-05-19T21:57:14] Yamal: how odd,,, Do you not feel safe at high speed?

[2024-05-19T22:16:01] Gordan Gizdic: I guess ADC1 is throttle and ADC2 is regen/brake switch?

[2024-05-19T22:16:42] Gordan Gizdic: thnx, been a year or more since i touched VESC
[2024-05-19T22:17:48] NetworkDir: and on input adc settings you should select "Current No Reverse Brake ADC2"

[2024-05-20T01:12:27] Yamal: Is it a 50s style? capacity and discharge We'll have to see how it holds up working over time... if it doesn't degrade as quickly as its cousin.
[2024-05-20T01:16:47] Yamal: <photos/photo_15095@20-05-2024_01-16-47.jpg>
[2024-05-20T01:17:30] Happy Giraffe: (P50B)Its a bit better than 45B at high currents, nothing groundbreaking
[2024-05-20T01:18:15] Happy Giraffe: XA3 however interesting claims, a 21700 cell even doing 50A would be mad impressive
[2024-05-20T01:35:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: 5000mAh 65A
[2024-05-20T01:35:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: 2 times more Powerful
[2024-05-20T01:58:32] haku: fkn finally finished wrapping. now time to check IR on every one. üò≠
[2024-05-20T02:01:00] rosheee: noiiiiiiiiiiice
[2024-05-20T02:07:24] haku: i shaped it like murica flag
[2024-05-20T06:35:43] Yamal: Cell?
[2024-05-20T06:35:56] haku: p42a
[2024-05-20T06:36:06] Yamal: Wou
[2024-05-20T06:36:12] Yamal: New proyect?
[2024-05-20T06:36:21] haku: maybe.
[2024-05-20T06:46:03] Happy Giraffe: <video_file>
[2024-05-20T06:46:28] Happy Giraffe: 3D printing boards that have the model grooves would be cool to use with plasma cutter and this kinda tool
[2024-05-20T06:47:38] haku: thats pretty cool
[2024-05-20T06:50:11] Happy Giraffe: YupüòÅ
[2024-05-20T06:53:10] Yamal: I would also like to do something with molicel in the future if I can,,! With the Samsung 40T I am very happy, the truth is that it is my first discharge battery, and it is amazing what the cells deliver without breaking a sweat, and it consoles me to know that they heat up less than the Molicel ones.
[2024-05-20T06:54:20] rosheee: <video_file>
[2024-05-20T06:54:54] haku: its very similar performance 40t and p42 acording to the battery lords
[2024-05-20T06:55:35] Yamal: 16s?
[2024-05-20T06:56:19] rosheee: yes üòÉ
[2024-05-20T06:56:36] haku: thats crazy
[2024-05-20T06:56:38] rosheee: but only 95% duty omg
[2024-05-20T06:56:39] Yamal: Nice üëç
[2024-05-20T06:58:46] Yamal: Right now I consider you the Sherlock Holmes of e-scooters, don't ask me why,,,
[2024-05-20T06:59:10] rosheee: XD? Y
[2024-05-20T07:00:22] Yamal: the way by how you do things üòÇ
[2024-05-20T07:03:09] Yamal: sometimes a bit crazy, impulsively but with good resultsü§£
[2024-05-20T07:04:23] rosheee: ^^ ‚ù§Ô∏è truedis
[2024-05-20T07:21:32] rosheee: How xD?
[2024-05-20T07:21:35] rosheee: Just do it
[2024-05-20T07:24:21] Yamal: I don't know why the 50s seemed to me to have more discharge... But this molicel is 50A 65 where peak?
[2024-05-20T07:25:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don't know, it's what they said in their annuncement
[2024-05-20T07:25:51] Yamal: I would start to forget a little about the G30 frame, it is limiting you a lot ^^'
[2024-05-20T07:25:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: 5ah and 13c means 65A
[2024-05-20T07:27:58] Yamal: I have no idea man, if you don't know it, no one knows it, but in Nkon it says 50A,, which by the way asks..! When we read the specifications of a cell, the battery discharge amperes would be nominal where the maximum peak it could deliver...?
[2024-05-20T07:42:54] Thierry: Single motor? 33x2?
[2024-05-20T07:46:32] rosheee: o.O 16s dual 50h
[2024-05-20T07:47:11] Thierry: The one with vsett 10 motors?
[2024-05-20T07:47:27] rosheee: nah gifted the vsett 10 motors to my cnc friend
[2024-05-20T07:47:59] rosheee: <video_file>
[2024-05-20T07:48:13] Yamal: probably 22/3 which is what scooters usually ride
[2024-05-20T07:48:40] rosheee: nah
[2024-05-20T07:48:44] rosheee: 16x4 or so idk
[2024-05-20T07:48:46] Thierry: How do you install controller?
[2024-05-20T07:48:47] rosheee: nah not 16x4
[2024-05-20T07:48:48] rosheee: XD SORRY
[2024-05-20T07:48:59] rosheee: idk windings ^^' omg
[2024-05-20T07:49:06] rosheee: but kinda vsett
[2024-05-20T07:49:06] Thierry: 17x4 probably
[2024-05-20T07:49:08] rosheee: yes
[2024-05-20T07:49:42] Yamal: You won't fall too much, because with those bumpers you'll go to the ground quickly.
[2024-05-20T07:49:44] Thierry: 17x4 is less kv than vsett, 17x4 spin at 100kmh in air at 20s
[2024-05-20T07:49:55] rosheee: ok
[2024-05-20T07:49:56] rosheee: then idk
[2024-05-20T07:50:28] Thierry: If 130kmh in air at 20s -> 22x3
[2024-05-20T07:50:41] rosheee: its 16s ^^' but i can do it in air
[2024-05-20T07:50:43] rosheee: wait
[2024-05-20T07:50:50] Yamal: Same nami
[2024-05-20T07:50:52] Thierry: Without fw
[2024-05-20T07:51:43] Happy Giraffe: 50S is like 20A cellüòÅ
[2024-05-20T07:51:52] Thierry: Controllers are as you usually do, on bottom alu cover? What controller?
[2024-05-20T07:52:56] rosheee: <video_file>
[2024-05-20T07:54:01] Yamal: Let's see if you get an e-scooter, it takes away the excitement of riding it from my point of view.
[2024-05-20T07:54:27] rosheee: ubox dual 75v üòÜlike always in 16s
[2024-05-20T07:55:08] Yamal: Red / purple one?
[2024-05-20T07:55:20] rosheee: old red v1 beta is sadly broken
[2024-05-20T07:55:23] rosheee: now v2 purple
[2024-05-20T07:57:15] Yamal: üõ¥->üëç üö≤->üëé
[2024-05-20T07:58:01] Thierry: 110kmh at 16s is around kv38. So probably 22x3
[2024-05-20T07:58:15] rosheee: 50h 22x3 ^^?
[2024-05-20T07:58:41] Thierry: The values i gave before were for 60H
[2024-05-20T07:59:06] Thierry: Yes if 50mm then for same winding, kv is a bit higher
[2024-05-20T07:59:16] rosheee: i know
[2024-05-20T07:59:51] Thierry: I see
[2024-05-20T08:00:19] rosheee: XD they sa y16x4 rofl
[2024-05-20T08:00:44] rosheee: 65h 33x2 44kv
[2024-05-20T08:00:45] Thierry: In the video, it heats so fast, I think you will have issue if you try on track...
[2024-05-20T08:00:54] rosheee: ah i have to change sum stuff
[2024-05-20T08:01:04] rosheee: controller not rly mounted on aluplate
[2024-05-20T08:01:50] Thierry: You set around 242mm wheel diameter?
[2024-05-20T08:01:52] rosheee: + idk if ubox done for 125-130A battery each esc side and 180-220A phase

[2024-05-21T01:14:09] Happy Giraffe: Boring monotonic nerdy stuff where the honey is
[2024-05-21T01:14:48] haku: we need a good lookin vesc youtuber to spread the good word
[2024-05-21T01:15:33] haku: no these guys are different. NY boys

[2024-05-21T01:16:47] puneDir: E bike guy is a secret bomb maker
[2024-05-21T01:16:48] Happy Giraffe: Another High Voltage from US and those are white boys
[2024-05-21T01:16:52] haku: we need a white dude with all due respect.

[2024-05-21T07:05:23] haku: i think this is only available in china
[2024-05-21T07:05:42] haku: good for a small car
[2024-05-21T07:06:42] Yamal: ?
[2024-05-21T07:06:56] haku: fardriver esc
[2024-05-21T07:07:33] Yamal: You really want fardriver?
[2024-05-21T07:07:48] Yamal: Like weped sonic
[2024-05-21T07:08:10] haku: no. but its cheap. there are better options but money be funny
[2024-05-21T07:10:51] Yamal: For Wich proyect,,?
[2024-05-21T07:10:57] Yamal: Ebike?
[2024-05-21T07:11:10] haku: future moped
[2024-05-21T07:11:42] haku: or something with bigger wheels
[2024-05-21T07:12:24] Yamal: With seat.. üòî
[2024-05-21T07:12:49] haku: yes. my back is to old to be standing up
[2024-05-21T07:13:51] Yamal: did you have any injuries?
[2024-05-21T07:14:18] haku: some knee injuries when i was young.
[2024-05-21T07:14:46] Yamal: training?
[2024-05-21T07:14:54] haku: aye
[2024-05-21T07:17:36] Yamal: es America, you are pioneers in muscle and neuromuscular activation, it is a very cutting-edge method to cure physical injuries through physical exercise, I have an uncle who took this training in Denver, and it is wonderful and expensive too üòÖ, not many people do it known , I recommend it to you !
[2024-05-21T07:18:16] haku: stem cells is expensive
[2024-05-21T07:19:26] Yamal: I have seen it, they test and through plans, they treat muscle atrophy with physical exercise
[2024-05-21T07:19:42] haku: we call that rehab
[2024-05-21T07:20:05] Yamal: Nop! Man
[2024-05-21T07:21:02] haku: not rehab for narcotics but rehab for injuries.
[2024-05-21T07:22:11] haku: i still do rehab workouts when hurt
[2024-05-21T07:22:22] Yamal: It has nothing to do with the rehabilitation that is done in a hospital after an accident, nothing to do with physiotherapy, or anything like that, here in Europe there are not many people who do it, This is usually taken by footballers and money people"" it costs around ‚Ç¨100 per hour, people get confused with this and don't know it..
[2024-05-21T07:23:28] haku: gh and stem cell injections. yea?
[2024-05-21T07:23:44] Yamal: No
[2024-05-21T07:23:49] haku: maybe testostorone replacement therapy?
[2024-05-21T07:25:06] haku: the trans do that now. girls more facial hair than me
[2024-05-21T07:25:32] Yamal: no injections or medications, just physical exercise, I thought that in America you were more aware of this technique, the whole subject of biomechanics
[2024-05-21T07:26:12] haku: isnt it called just training for your specific sport
[2024-05-21T07:28:34] haku: europe never drug test thats why they always win olympic sports. look at the east european wrestlers compared to US. dudes are huge
[2024-05-21T07:29:54] haku: anyways im too poor to afford what you guys do i europe.
[2024-05-21T07:52:41] Yamal: I am not rich brother, just another worker who achieves things with effort and work, and in Europe, more of the same... what there are most are workers, there are also people who sleep in shanties or on the street, and many that on the 20th of the month it no longer has a penny, so don't believe everything they tell you
[2024-05-21T07:55:23] Yamal: I always say that you have to have money in your pocket, not in your heart... people who spend their lives chasing money, seeking to amass and make great fortunes with hardly any "enjoyment" or time for their family, Time is money so don't waste it, ride your scooter and enjoy!

[2024-05-21T19:36:39] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: on the paper the mos specs are very worst than what we use so far, but in r√©ality i am curious to see
[2024-05-21T19:36:48] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Like, Chinese Specs Vs Infineon
[2024-05-21T20:16:26] Yamal: What do you mean, that the electronics you use now provide better data than the specifications of the x 12?
[2024-05-21T20:25:43] Yamal: Is Tronic the best electronics on the market? and little Focer his cousin? I say this because I am going to take them shortly, the two green little Focer plates,,^^

[2024-05-21T21:06:05] Yamal: This man have some controller review, nice
[2024-05-21T21:36:51] Yamal: ?

[2024-05-21T23:56:47] haku: is x12 the champ right now as for vescs?
[2024-05-21T23:57:06] haku: what about the trampa 500?
[2024-05-22T00:02:50] Yamal: no idea, we'll have to see it throw data,,, I would also like to be able to try trampa one day too, that particular model is very large...
[2024-05-22T00:03:36] haku: only @roscheeee knows how it performs.
[2024-05-22T00:04:01] haku: i think that vesc is made for small ebikes
[2024-05-22T00:04:45] Yamal: Roscheeee and Leo Pev heh
[2024-05-22T00:05:44] haku: spintend still champ for bang for buck yea?
[2024-05-22T00:07:11] Yamal: It seems to be, and that the 85/250 are cream
[2024-05-22T00:13:54] Yamal: good news, the plane has just arrived in Spain with the chips! I can now sleep in peace! sayonara
[2024-05-22T00:48:08] cihan: Do you think Ninebot g30 without suspension or ninebot max g2 is more durable on long term in terms of harm caused by vibration? Suspension seems to be better choice since it decreases vibration a lot but I feel like suspension itself could be a problem and could get damaged. What's your opinion?
[2024-05-22T00:57:14] JPPL: G300‚ù§Ô∏è

[2024-05-22T01:04:26] haku: what a tank
[2024-05-22T01:05:11] haku: crash at 80km/h how was the rider?
[2024-05-22T01:07:01] haku: hope he/shes fine
[2024-05-22T01:07:06] NetworkDir: xD rider little bit fucked up but now he ok some broke on hand and some stitches-scratches. (Actually he very lucky because without any protection like helmet and ETC)
[2024-05-22T01:08:57] NetworkDir: Guys always use protection at least helmet. Because any damage on head can permanently ..
[2024-05-22T01:09:24] JPPL: DNM shocks

[2024-05-22T01:14:56] haku: that tire waht size is it?
[2024-05-22T01:15:07] JPPL: 13" for 7" rim
[2024-05-22T01:15:22] JPPL: There's similar for 6.5

[2024-05-22T01:24:24] haku: cool techique. no scratches
[2024-05-22T01:25:44] JPPL: Sometimes in the end you need a push with tool, can be plastic if strong, but it makes it so easy, I use since I had xiaomi
[2024-05-22T02:03:48] Jan: Its like 15mm steel rod, i dont know what you guys do with it but that cant be riding
[2024-05-22T02:04:28] Jan: Try bending a 20cm 15mm steelrod
[2024-05-22T02:07:46] cihan: Is SNSC frame same as g30 frame?
[2024-05-22T02:08:14] haku: beefier and top mount i think
[2024-05-22T02:09:10] haku: i wish i can get one of those.
[2024-05-22T02:09:54] cihan: 15mm steel rod is something very very rigid, you can't bend it anyway. Even high quality 4-5mm chrome vanadium steel screwdrivers are impossible to bend.
[2024-05-22T02:11:07] haku: g30 already a tank. snsc must be crazy strong
[2024-05-22T02:11:22] cihan: I see them here often on rental scooters. But I don't know how rental company gets them. Some people claim that rental company gives them to employees for cheap price. They are being sold on local apps but they could be stolen too.
[2024-05-22T02:11:56] haku: not available in US i think. this only euro privilage
[2024-05-22T02:12:52] haku: i need to do research maybe available here
[2024-05-22T02:12:59] cihan: I've seen 3 people on same rental scooter exceeding 200 KG many times. Their frames are really durable.
[2024-05-22T02:13:55] haku: you see g30 and snsc modifications isnt a scene here in the US. wish it was
[2024-05-22T02:15:55] haku: once regulations come it will be i think
[2024-05-22T02:16:20] cihan: <photos/photo_15115@22-05-2024_02-16-20.jpg>
[2024-05-22T02:16:36] cihan: This is the photo I took myself. One of the many rentals here in my home city.
[2024-05-22T02:17:02] haku: send me one üòú
[2024-05-22T02:17:50] cihan: I'm smoking at the balcony and I see one blinking it's rear light parked on the street. Should I steal it? ;)
[2024-05-22T02:18:22] haku: no. i was just joking. dont get in trouble
[2024-05-22T02:18:45] haku: i will find "auctioned" ones
[2024-05-22T02:19:01] cihan: I can email the company about it. Maybe they're willing to sell a new one if Ninebot allows them to resell.
[2024-05-22T02:19:32] haku: there are auctions for these ive heard
[2024-05-22T02:19:55] cihan: Who sells them? Does rental company sell used ones?
[2024-05-22T02:20:29] haku: im not sure. someone here knows maybe @jamessoderstrom
[2024-05-22T02:24:58] cihan: NinebotSNSC2.0Brochure.pdf
[2024-05-22T02:25:07] cihan: I found this brochure for SNSC 2.0. It's 1.3 kg heavier than g30
[2024-05-22T02:25:33] cihan: I've learned a lot from James.)
[2024-05-22T02:26:22] haku: he a realest vesclord
[2024-05-22T02:30:27] cihan: I still couldn't reach that point when I'll install VESC and connect it to PC but I used to ask him a lot about cables, connectors. Well, I'm happy that he's still not really sick and tired of me. :)

[2024-05-22T07:03:32] Yamal: In the end we will all end up with a g30 at home...
[2024-05-22T10:37:24] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: What model ?
[2024-05-22T10:37:59] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: And also if you have an understanding in shocks how do I chose a shock according to my wesghit ?
[2024-05-22T11:06:04] Dimitar: Guys any idea if Dualtron controllers will work with Vsett 11 motors?
[2024-05-22T11:08:10] cihan: By the way g30 weighs 18.7 kg but G30E II weighs 20kg. I don't know what's the difference causing that increase.
[2024-05-22T11:14:26] Yamal: Your new frame arrive o no arrive üòÅ?
[2024-05-22T11:27:12] NetworkDir: Yes works but i don't recommend

[2024-05-22T11:41:14] Tan Sean: Can anybody help with temp sensor? Connectet one with hall ground and the other with temp but it doesnt show anything?
[2024-05-22T12:15:37] Dimitar: Why?
[2024-05-22T12:19:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: @jamaludin_algarnati @roscheeee
[2024-05-22T12:21:26] NetworkDir: Dualtron controller actually bullshit. Sensorless Squarewave Very low khz = more heat for motor
[2024-05-22T12:44:26] Dimitar: Vsett is sensorless square wave, and no regen brake above 50 percent battery so it is worse and dangerous. I realize that vesc is better but don't want to experiment with setting and burn expensive controllers
[2024-05-22T12:47:26] NetworkDir: Vesc anyway better but for what you want maybe teverun or kaabo controllers better
[2024-05-22T12:47:49] NetworkDir: i think teverun is sinewave also wolf king gtr
[2024-05-22T12:48:03] Dimitar: But they are not sensorless
[2024-05-22T12:48:25] NetworkDir: true
[2024-05-22T12:48:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: Actually they are cheaper ahahah
[2024-05-22T12:48:48] NetworkDir: but i think ubox 80150 enough for you
[2024-05-22T12:49:16] NetworkDir: 250$ for 250A controller
[2024-05-22T12:49:45] Dimitar: Flipsky are cheaper, they are not going to last on a total of 200 kg mass
[2024-05-22T12:49:57] NetworkDir: don't buy flipsky/makerbase
[2024-05-22T12:50:01] GABE: Lmao
[2024-05-22T12:50:04] GABE: cheaper
[2024-05-22T12:50:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: It will last
[2024-05-22T12:50:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: Just depends by luck üòÇ
[2024-05-22T12:50:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because they put used and fake chips
[2024-05-22T12:51:10] Dimitar: I work in a scooter repair shop, the electricician was trying them in his scooter, burned them a couple of times
[2024-05-22T12:51:21] GABE: the flipsky?
[2024-05-22T12:51:26] Dimitar: Yes
[2024-05-22T12:51:48] Dimitar: He burned them so many times I don't want to touch them
[2024-05-22T12:52:01] GABE: Yeah spintend better
[2024-05-22T12:52:03] NetworkDir: https://spintend.com/products/single-ubox-aluminum-controller-80v-100a-based-on-vesc
[2024-05-22T12:52:18] Dimitar: I want to ride, not to wait for him to repair my scooter
[2024-05-22T12:52:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think flipsky > spintend @jamessoderstrom
[2024-05-22T12:52:36] GABE: no
[2024-05-22T12:52:53] GABE: spintend has improved circuitry
[2024-05-22T12:52:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: Alu pcb unfortunately yes
[2024-05-22T12:53:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: Mine gone in free wheel
[2024-05-22T12:53:33] GABE: spintend died during freewheel?
[2024-05-22T12:53:35] GABE: mine doesn't..
[2024-05-22T12:53:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not with tiny motor :(
[2024-05-22T12:54:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: My flip sky run mtpa + fw and still alive
[2024-05-22T12:54:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: I ride 100km on them at full power and still alive , I don‚Äôt even believe Xd
[2024-05-22T12:55:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm surprised, flipsky didn‚Äôt
[2024-05-22T12:56:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2024-05-22T12:56:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: In freewheel
[2024-05-22T12:57:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: I mean, that‚Äôs also difference between fet rated with super low IR and some with little bit higher
[2024-05-22T12:57:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: Depends also by tolerance of their rating
[2024-05-22T13:03:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt want to knowüòÇ
[2024-05-22T13:03:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: The only thing I want to say, is unfortunately flipsky handle better than spintend
[2024-05-22T13:10:17] Yamal: ü§Ø
[2024-05-22T13:10:29] Yamal: üê¨
[2024-05-22T14:18:33] Happy Giraffe: Should show, whats the type of it? NTC10K should give multimeter resistance reading of 7-10kOhms when comparing between GND and T
[2024-05-22T14:52:08] Noname: Vsett 11 with stock battery. Don't use regen with stock bms and life is good. Best decision ever.
[2024-05-22T14:52:59] Rose: Hey there Richard, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-05-22T14:53:12] M|R: hi guys can anyone help me with my blisters
[2024-05-22T15:10:08] Dimitar: Regen is a must for me, I changed the BMS already. How many km do you have with the new controllers?
[2024-05-22T15:10:30] Noname: Couple hundred miles so far idk never look
[2024-05-22T15:11:32] Noname: Regen is awesome but use the stock brakes once and a while to keep them working. I had a panic situation and they were dirty and didn't do much üôÉ
[2024-05-22T15:13:19] Dimitar: Of course, I am currently using magura, but without regen even magura is useless at high speeds or long decline
[2024-05-22T15:13:33] Dimitar: And I am heavy as fuck
[2024-05-22T15:13:36] Dimitar: üòÇüòÇ
[2024-05-22T15:14:06] Dimitar: I can boil the mineral oil in a few seconds
[2024-05-22T15:14:31] Noname: It doesn't add much for distance. Around 50-60 wh a mile I calculated I added 1800ft to my ride
[2024-05-22T15:14:58] Dimitar: But for braking it does wonders
[2024-05-22T15:15:55] Dimitar: So magura royal blood is not good enough?
[2024-05-22T15:16:12] Noname: Well they're bicycle brakes so they suck. Going to disconnect stock brakes from regen because switching from regen throttle to brakes it shuts them off. It's not smooth transition just hook to brake lights
[2024-05-22T15:17:23] Dimitar: I'll try it, thanks
[2024-05-22T15:18:50] Dimitar: It is funny how much I am willing to do to get regen, and you are just getting rid of it like that
[2024-05-22T15:18:56] Dimitar: üòÇüòÇ
[2024-05-22T15:21:02] Yamal: üî•
[2024-05-22T15:21:58] Noname: Yeah strength is on low anyway. But if on regen then add disc it shuts off regen
[2024-05-22T15:23:03] sombre_enfant: Did u look if u can do both ?
[2024-05-22T15:23:08] Noname: Regen is almost enough for anything but panic stop it's at -90a it's sensitive so I don't want to turn it up more
[2024-05-22T15:24:02] Noname: Just busy I'll swap wires on vacation
[2024-05-22T15:24:10] Konstantin: Y, I'm writing them email, really they provide good service
[2024-05-22T15:24:27] Konstantin: <photos/photo_15118@22-05-2024_15-24-27.jpg>
[2024-05-22T15:27:40] Franchesco Carofano: I installed a pair yesterday, everything was fine. The client traveled 8 kilometers and suddenly one of the controllers ran out of power, it turned off, so it was checked, there is no burn or overheating or anything.
[2024-05-22T15:35:01] Happy Giraffe: Use second throttle for regen and charge batt only to 97% to leave some room for it
[2024-05-22T15:35:23] Happy Giraffe: I have no idea why people are not running a regen throttleüò≥
[2024-05-22T15:41:26] Dimitar: Interesting idea, if brakes are disconnected there is no need to charge to 97 percent. Just don't use the regen throttle the first kilometer
[2024-05-22T15:41:56] Happy Giraffe: Thats also possible
[2024-05-22T16:18:14] Noname: Not even that far unless you start by going down a mountain I guess. Watch regen wh and compare to used wh.
[2024-05-22T17:03:21] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/AQ6HM6bnnic?si=xPw8rXVzgjh5G1tc
[2024-05-22T17:21:05] Franchesco Carofano: If we're working on this, we know what they are.
[2024-05-22T17:21:10] Franchesco Carofano: <photos/photo_15119@22-05-2024_17-21-10.jpg>
[2024-05-22T17:21:31] Franchesco Carofano: to go safe
[2024-05-22T17:37:30] Franchesco Carofano: I didn't heat anything, brother, I was stopped and the controller turned off, it wasn't abdabdo, I turned it off, turned it on and it didn't turn on anymore.
[2024-05-22T17:59:42] haku: what they do repairs?. cool
[2024-05-22T19:11:36] Yamal: Flipsky 12fet?
[2024-05-22T19:41:14] Yamal: There are ?
[2024-05-22T19:41:32] Yamal: Like 85/200
[2024-05-22T19:41:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: I have them also
[2024-05-22T19:41:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not in use
[2024-05-22T19:42:20] Yamal: Wich model ,,? Only for know üòÖ
[2024-05-22T19:43:10] Yamal: How is your wolf ,,? Ride or no ride ?
[2024-05-22T19:43:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: Sunday last time I ride it
[2024-05-22T19:43:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: Total 100km full speed
[2024-05-22T19:45:31] Yamal: I'm glad to know that you move your e-scooters, and even more so on long routes!
[2024-05-22T19:46:47] Yamal: I think I asked you once, and I couldn't find an answer,,, What esc are you wearing in the wolf?
[2024-05-22T19:48:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: I switch vesc many times, for try, that's why I never told you
[2024-05-22T19:48:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: But actually with flipsky, because is very very small , and I removed useless box
[2024-05-22T19:49:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: I did my best to made the scooter lighter possible, unfortunately wolf frame is very bad engineered. Even is heavy af it's unstable
[2024-05-22T19:51:20] Yamal: Do you have a new frame or model in mind?
[2024-05-22T19:51:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: No I left the hobby many times ago
[2024-05-22T19:52:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: I just use it for some ride
[2024-05-22T19:52:46] haku: lets do emotos mr wu
[2024-05-22T19:53:06] Yamal: tired of e-scooter,,? Tired of Vesc?
[2024-05-22T19:53:39] Yamal: better a motorcycle a car ?xD
[2024-05-22T19:55:06] Yamal: but it's good to talk for the sake of talking, you must not be so tired of the hobby when you did 100km last Sunday
[2024-05-22T19:55:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: Nono i mean tired to play with them
[2024-05-22T19:55:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: But u still love it as vehicle
[2024-05-22T19:56:15] haku: have you thought about switching to bigger pevs?
[2024-05-22T19:56:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: No haha I just mean I'm tired to play with escooter, specially for people who did it as job
[2024-05-22T19:57:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: It stress you so much fixing problem because of Chinese shit engineering
[2024-05-22T20:16:10] Yamal: Did you tell me, once you met Michael or did I dream it...?
[2024-05-22T20:19:14] Yamal: It would be cool to go to Ningbo China, by the way, a colleague was there 2 weeks ago and told me that there were very few e-scooters,,,,, all motorcycles...
[2024-05-22T20:25:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2024-05-22T20:26:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: No one in china run escooter normally
[2024-05-22T20:32:46] Yamal: Why?
[2024-05-22T20:34:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: They normally use e-bike
[2024-05-22T20:46:34] haku: same in the US. yesterday i saw a mom riding a talaria with her daughter in the park. pretty cool
[2024-05-22T20:47:27] haku: ive only seen one scooter guy in our hood and he rides a gt2 he might be in the spectrum
[2024-05-22T20:47:57] haku: he just rides full blast almost running over kids
[2024-05-22T20:56:49] haku: i tried to befriend him but i think hes not interested.
[2024-05-22T21:07:05] Yamal: Segway gt2?
[2024-05-22T21:07:17] Happy Giraffe: You are geh if you befriended the guy instead of the milf
[2024-05-22T21:07:19] haku: yea.
[2024-05-22T21:07:47] haku: im already friends with the mommy
[2024-05-22T21:08:54] haku: she doesnt know im into pevs though. if i tell her i rides a scooter she might think twice.
[2024-05-22T21:12:46] haku: i asked the mom how fast the talria goes. she said 70mph. i call bs but its all good
[2024-05-22T21:14:27] sombre_enfant: Dont talk bout ev dont fumble u can get a step dad status and clap some cheeks def worth it
[2024-05-22T21:18:15] Happy Giraffe: Build a faster scooter and challenge her to a race and winner gets head
[2024-05-22T21:19:58] haku: atleast she knows i drive electric. might be some points there
[2024-05-22T21:20:03] Happy Giraffe: Police here have a e-vehicle check-on patrol this weekend, guess Im not riding lol
[2024-05-22T21:20:40] haku: dam they getting stricter there
[2024-05-22T21:21:00] Happy Giraffe: If not getting last new bike parts on tomorrow and friday, gotta avoid weekend
[2024-05-22T21:21:22] Happy Giraffe: A little maybe, but its just for safe vehicle and speed checks
[2024-05-22T22:01:22] haku: @Happy_Giraffe https://youtube.com/shorts/Y-l7mLWkS_8?si=cIPUnB3XbQ1bzIKT
[2024-05-22T22:12:04] Yamal: freedom to do what you want üòÅ
[2024-05-22T22:13:13] haku: sometimes too much freedom.
[2024-05-22T22:13:33] Yamal: For example, can 7 or 8 people go there in a 5-seater car?
[2024-05-22T22:14:10] haku: yep. ask the mexicans.
[2024-05-22T22:17:59] Yamal: What is the best state to live in North America from your point of view?
[2024-05-22T22:18:44] haku: no idea. but red states are more free imo
[2024-05-22T22:18:55] GABE: red states definitely more free. Naturally.
[2024-05-22T22:19:24] GABE: Don't brake.
[2024-05-22T22:21:06] Yamal: They say that in Canada there are a lot of jobs and opportunities for example, but the West Coast must definitely be cool ^^'
[2024-05-22T22:21:54] Yamal: Back from Germany heh?
[2024-05-22T22:21:58] haku: if i had a choice north west. you get the best scenery
[2024-05-22T22:22:21] GABE: <video_file>
[2024-05-22T22:22:35] GABE: Nope.
[2024-05-22T22:22:45] haku: change that water son. yuck
[2024-05-22T22:22:58] GABE: It's clean, that's acidified into the glass.
[2024-05-22T22:23:02] GABE: Water is clean
[2024-05-22T22:23:09] GABE: alcohol cleaning is expensive business.
[2024-05-22T22:24:26] Yamal: Holidays?
[2024-05-22T22:37:04] Yamal: hangover in Germany
[2024-05-22T22:47:07] Yamal: you are missing the korean and the monkey
[2024-05-22T23:01:22] haku: the dream is to recreate a emoto version of this.
[2024-05-22T23:02:25] haku: without the symbols ofcourse.
[2024-05-22T23:03:07] haku: i can fit my dog and my son in there.
[2024-05-22T23:04:24] Yamal: Also your Lady üòÇ
[2024-05-22T23:05:16] haku: daddy is single. gents tell your hot friends if they need a green card
[2024-05-22T23:06:23] Yamal: the world is full of women
[2024-05-22T23:07:18] haku: murikan women just want moneys.
[2024-05-22T23:07:50] haku: i need a lady who will cook and clean for a broke single dad
[2024-05-22T23:08:18] Yamal: Man I‚Äôm driving ü§£‚Ä¶.
[2024-05-22T23:33:58] Yamal: haku the topic of women is very complicated, there are women from "home" but you have to travel to find them, what I'm going to tell you that you don't know...
[2024-05-22T23:42:52] Yamal: I mean there are some, but in modern societies, it is difficult, complicated, We are in the era of consumerism, of appearance, of trying to be more or have more than the other,, So that's what we have, I say this because this topic has been going on for a long time. I have single colleagues in the search "" and I always tell them the same thing, go to Africa or Asia and search in the humble towns and always look at the families... ..
[2024-05-22T23:43:05] rosheee: me as well..max 2 weeks then can show
[2024-05-22T23:43:26] rosheee: in 2 weeks then
[2024-05-22T23:45:38] rosheee: which u use ^^?
[2024-05-22T23:46:40] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: R350, the controller I sell, it's a Spinted with hardware and software modified
[2024-05-22T23:47:12] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: 1 & 2 in French cup have that actually
[2024-05-22T23:47:21] rosheee: which fets ^^?
[2024-05-22T23:47:25] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: 3 & 4 have C350
[2024-05-22T23:47:50] Yamal: Could you show some screenshots of vesc tool to see the data they provide!ü§©
[2024-05-22T23:48:04] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: that's secret, too much ppl copy me I prefer to don't say many information to avoid the copy
[2024-05-22T23:49:00] Yamal: the championship is at stake hehe
[2024-05-22T23:49:01] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but isn't just the mosfet, and it's not incredible mosfet, but many toll mos have datasheet specs better than infineon and I think the Chinese mos over spec the sheet and infineon maybe not
[2024-05-22T23:49:28] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: that's why I am curious of X12
[2024-05-22T23:49:40] rosheee: the original mosfets of the 85250 are rly nice
[2024-05-22T23:50:11] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: cuz according if datasheet it's seem shit but some ppl told me it's very nice and peak at 600A so... that's impossible with even 450A toll mos on the market
[2024-05-22T23:50:31] rosheee: at 40khz
[2024-05-22T23:50:53] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: try in 22S and come back to me üòÇ
[2024-05-22T23:51:19] rosheee: just tried in 20s and they stay cool AF but i hit abs
[2024-05-22T23:51:27] rosheee: u know max phase i could send on the OG fets?
[2024-05-22T23:51:40] rosheee: doing now 350a ;-/
[2024-05-22T23:51:52] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: that's the point, they pretend handle 600A phase with 12 TOLT 120v mos and we can't get much more than 400 with 12 best toll 100v mos so, something wrong
[2024-05-22T23:52:49] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: you even can up to 400 in 20S not issue
[2024-05-22T23:53:38] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: and you can have one will perform well another will dry, that mos seem very not stable
[2024-05-22T23:54:06] rosheee: what 0vf u running?
[2024-05-22T23:54:08] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: not at all, put a clamp on it and prove it üòÇ
[2024-05-22T23:54:27] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: they just say it no-one check if it's real, me I told you about real value not commercial shit
[2024-05-22T23:54:52] rosheee: @Foujiwara
[2024-05-22T23:55:00] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: I think Torp 500 are real 350 at least
[2024-05-22T23:55:33] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: nice, should be good, it's long time I want to try
[2024-05-22T23:56:49] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yeah true, but I saw many design, and I push many controller to the limit I know real life are 200A per 100v mos toll at least in very not safe area, and Torp can be 250/mos? üòÇ
[2024-05-22T23:57:52] rosheee: @Foujiwara what 0vf u can run on ur 350?
[2024-05-22T23:58:23] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: what's 0vf?
[2024-05-22T23:58:32] rosheee: switching frequency

[2024-05-22T23:58:54] Yamal: use the English language please, this is an English language group
[2024-05-22T23:59:10] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: 30 khz 22S 260A battery 400A phase
[2024-05-22T23:59:26] rosheee: zero vector frequency = 0vf
[2024-05-23T00:00:18] Yamal: I'm joking, at your leisure! we are learning !
[2024-05-23T00:01:20] NetworkDir: Any option in vesc available like dualtron shitty E-ABS ? Sounds from motor like 2 phase short and result tik tik tik sound
[2024-05-23T00:04:43] NetworkDir: idk i just ask xD
[2024-05-23T00:05:31] NetworkDir: Dualtron users actually love e-abs sound
[2024-05-23T00:05:36] NetworkDir: Also shitty squarewave
[2024-05-23T00:05:39] NetworkDir: idk why
[2024-05-23T00:06:42] NetworkDir: I try with vesc on bldc mode but sound different but normal because vesc power algo and etc different
[2024-05-23T00:23:41] Yamal: 2 weeks‚Ä¶. X12‚Ä¶. Infineon performance‚Ä¶..
[2024-05-23T00:31:17] NetworkDir: On bldc?
[2024-05-23T00:31:25] NetworkDir: Or FOC
[2024-05-23T00:31:40] Yamal: The other day I took a Q5 with thunder electronics, and you see, I didn't remember what the minimotor jerks were,, total discomfort..
[2024-05-23T00:33:53] NetworkDir: Yeah xD
[2024-05-23T00:34:03] puneDir: Why
[2024-05-23T00:34:12] NetworkDir: And 30khz vs 40khz
[2024-05-23T00:34:28] NetworkDir: Maybe kill vesc also motor should unhappy
[2024-05-23T00:37:05] Yamal: But how do they act or what do the khz do in the application?
[2024-05-23T00:38:38] Yamal: It would be cool if classes were taught about vesc in general and its application.. :(
[2024-05-23T00:40:17] Yamal: It's all so sophisticated that without knowing it's better not to touch, but anyway I guess it's a process that everyone here has gone through,,
[2024-05-23T00:47:58] Yamal: Could you organize an online course with zoom or what do I know, I would be willing to sign up
[2024-05-23T00:48:45] JPPL: Read frequency, more will heat a little bit, more processing but no advantage I think, less like 20 is ok also
[2024-05-23T00:51:32] JPPL: This Torp vesc controller
[2024-05-23T00:51:45] JPPL: Specs are like makerx g300
[2024-05-23T00:52:06] JPPL: More than double price
[2024-05-23T00:54:05] JPPL: Tc1000 is something else
[2024-05-23T00:54:05] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. JPPL has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-05-23T00:56:15] Yamal: How about your g300 in the 11x with the temp issue and demanding the machine?
[2024-05-23T00:56:59] JPPL: I just use it for normal rides or top speed, so no hard track rides like performance guys, temperature was not an issue
[2024-05-23T00:57:17] JPPL: Is the controller with more metal than I know
[2024-05-23T00:57:44] JPPL: Soon I'm testing 22s on it to see max speed
[2024-05-23T00:58:50] Yamal: Now with 20s?
[2024-05-23T01:03:15] JPPL: Until now was 20s yes
[2024-05-23T01:03:25] JPPL: 151max kph
[2024-05-23T01:14:38] Yamal: stratospheric top speed, I think you don't need more!üòÖ
[2024-05-23T01:15:17] Yamal: What is the phase A and peak watts?
[2024-05-23T01:22:20] JPPL: Will check cuz can't remember, 9 months ago
[2024-05-23T01:28:08] rosheee: Simple math: 12 tolt at 331a divided to high and low = 6 mosfets divided to 3 phases = 2x 331A each get = 662A peaks of amps
[2024-05-23T01:49:06] haku: if torp app is correct thats the best 12fet vesc then. ask you buddy to flash it.
[2024-05-23T03:13:51] haku: does torp use tolt?
[2024-05-23T06:48:18] Yamal: https://youtu.be/NOQMM4PPlis?si=vZnV9h2d3ZAwhm4c
[2024-05-23T06:52:16] Noname: Ah yeah they always laying over even the bikes. If people only had enough sense to park them
[2024-05-23T06:52:21] haku: i can help them with that problem. i think this is snsc yea?
[2024-05-23T06:52:43] Noname: Yeah you should know
[2024-05-23T06:53:14] Noname: Dude if they were not tracked I could fill my truck in minutes
[2024-05-23T06:53:46] Noname: Just go to the college area it's like an invasion
[2024-05-23T06:53:47] haku: i would rent a u-haul and go at it
[2024-05-23T06:54:10] Noname: Like Pok√©mon go for scooter nerds
[2024-05-23T06:54:54] haku: this is why scooters get a bad look in some cities. too bad they dont have it here
[2024-05-23T06:55:39] Yamal: No have in USA like this for rent ,,?
[2024-05-23T06:55:58] Noname: Besides the laying on the ground its an eyesore to have bright orange scoots everywhere. Honestly looks like litter
[2024-05-23T06:56:01] haku: some cities do. not all
[2024-05-23T06:56:18] Noname: East coast yeah
[2024-05-23T06:56:48] haku: some parts of LA have it too i think
[2024-05-23T06:57:56] Yamal: What danger are the two of you together!!!üòÇ
[2024-05-23T06:58:36] Noname: I don't want one, he's a bad man with ill intent
[2024-05-23T06:59:20] Noname: Getting a g30 for pocket lint so only reason to have a mini
[2024-05-23T06:59:53] haku: i really think that spin one is snsc
[2024-05-23T07:01:11] Yamal: Speaking of ninebot/segway, the truth is that the Gt2 catches my attention more than the G 30 but hey, actually today with the Nami I have enough...
[2024-05-23T07:01:13] haku: some dude in reddit was promoting taking the scooters back then wtf lol
[2024-05-23T07:01:43] Noname: Yeah but the front end brakes off lol
[2024-05-23T07:01:59] Noname: Looking at inmotion climber 2wd sleeper?
[2024-05-23T07:02:58] haku: ninebot g30/snsc still the best sleeper imo. too bad there is no modders here for that.
[2024-05-23T07:03:37] Yamal: not at all, the front part with its suspension system is what gives it the geometry and makes it interesting..
[2024-05-23T07:03:46] haku: regulations is coming. not to freak anyone but its coming
[2024-05-23T07:04:04] Noname: It's late thought you meant new g30
[2024-05-23T07:04:22] haku: g2?
[2024-05-23T07:04:37] haku: dam segway have a ton of different models
[2024-05-23T07:04:40] Noname: The steel g30 idk its 1am
[2024-05-23T07:04:44] Yamal: I mean Segway gt2
[2024-05-23T07:04:58] Yamal: Gt2 vs g30
[2024-05-23T07:05:07] Noname: Max g2
[2024-05-23T07:05:21] haku: gt2 is the biggest one they have.
[2024-05-23T07:06:12] Noname: I drove a 1 eh its refined and feels like a vegan should own it
[2024-05-23T07:06:25] haku: gt1 same thing but single motor
[2024-05-23T07:06:46] Yamal: The ninebot company should be paying more than one of you for mentioning the"g30" so many timesüòÅ
[2024-05-23T07:06:54] haku: it went on sale before in the segway store for 1200.
[2024-05-23T07:08:13] Yamal: the g30 at the end is 3 welded tubes ^^
[2024-05-23T07:08:28] haku: theres also a new 72v version i think. its called st
[2024-05-23T07:09:20] Yamal: ?
[2024-05-23T07:09:23] Noname: Well they sold 8 billion of them quite popular
[2024-05-23T07:10:18] haku: 72v segway. its called ST imstead of GT
[2024-05-23T07:10:50] haku: different frame. from gt
[2024-05-23T07:11:12] Yamal: In the end I will have to buy a second-hand one even if I don't get to prepare it, just to have one and drive it.(g30)
[2024-05-23T07:13:07] haku: i think the gt2 can fit 20s9p. pretty spacious.
[2024-05-23T07:13:56] haku: its like the harley of scooters i think. heavy and comftable.
[2024-05-23T07:13:59] Yamal: Well, the worst thing about all this is that in a little more a little less year I will have to move to a country where e-scooters are prohibited...
[2024-05-23T07:15:11] Yamal: It seems like a joke but hey, I'm about to take a Vesc suitcase, and try to move on kart circuits or a neighboring country but it will never be the same.. üòî
[2024-05-23T07:15:47] Noname: Where's that
[2024-05-23T07:16:03] Yamal: Singapur
[2024-05-23T07:16:06] haku: when regulations come we will be forced to mod g30s
[2024-05-23T07:16:39] Noname: F that go back to motorcycles for me
[2024-05-23T07:16:59] haku: agreed
[2024-05-23T07:17:05] Noname: Even a moped whatever
[2024-05-23T07:17:05] haku: maybe emoped
[2024-05-23T07:17:42] Yamal: We want to take our daughters to study, in fact they leave already in June, and they leave me alone, with the nami to squeeze out the time I have left,, part good and part bad...
[2024-05-23T07:17:50] Noname: I'd rather get a plate then play games with are they legal am I gonna get pulled over etc
[2024-05-23T07:18:40] Noname: It's just fun 90-100 miles is an all day adventure. On a bike it's whatever
[2024-05-23T07:18:46] Yamal: There are some e-scooter licenses left but very few, they are almost exterminated..
[2024-05-23T07:18:48] haku: since i live in the desert surrons will be the best for offroading
[2024-05-23T07:19:22] haku: very quiet compared to motos
[2024-05-23T07:20:00] Noname: Ah I'm just gonna get insurance and kinda untouchable mabey a small fine for speeding üòÜ
[2024-05-23T07:21:33] haku: a vespa is 50cc yea. that can pass as a e moped if you convert
[2024-05-23T07:21:52] haku: ugly af though
[2024-05-23T07:21:54] Noname: City cops don't care they have real criminals. And country they're nowhere to be found
[2024-05-23T07:22:08] Noname: Honestly electric sucks
[2024-05-23T07:22:26] Noname: It's just a time to hang out with friends and charge
[2024-05-23T07:22:40] Noname: I like the quiet though
[2024-05-23T07:23:06] haku: naw dude. electric will be the future
[2024-05-23T07:23:25] haku: it only sucks for long rides
[2024-05-23T07:23:43] Yamal: <photos/photo_15122@23-05-2024_07-23-43.jpg>
[2024-05-23T07:24:09] Noname: Planning a nice trip to a state park. Mostly searching for nice back roads and how the he'll do I charge because there's nothing bit farms.
[2024-05-23T07:24:26] Yamal: October last years..
[2024-05-23T07:24:30] haku: bring solar charger
[2024-05-23T07:24:58] Noname: Comedian in the house
[2024-05-23T07:25:16] Noname: Gonna be over 100mi trip
[2024-05-23T07:25:31] Noname: Take 43 years to charge
[2024-05-23T07:26:34] Yamal: of course ! You have to take advantage of the good weather!
[2024-05-23T07:26:43] haku: is there any ev charge stations there? thats the only thing i hate about evs. yiu have to plan your route
[2024-05-23T07:27:00] haku: the tech is badass though
[2024-05-23T07:27:39] Yamal: You do in vsett11?
[2024-05-23T07:28:04] Noname: It's scarce in the farm areas. And like to stay out of town centers end up on highways etc.
[2024-05-23T07:29:05] haku: apalachian trail is pretty place yea?
[2024-05-23T07:29:23] Yamal: Well, you already know that very long routes are organized based on charging points and stops...
[2024-05-23T07:30:17] Noname: Found a few miles of nothing had to turn around at the 1/2 way point. Ended up at 47 miles between charges
[2024-05-23T07:30:29] haku: just be careful out there. you never know if billybob wants a scooter
[2024-05-23T07:30:35] Yamal: You have Bear?
[2024-05-23T07:31:16] Noname: Not really there's been a couple around but not common
[2024-05-23T07:33:26] Noname: Eh just hikers more paranoid of city people
[2024-05-23T07:34:33] haku: agreed
[2024-05-23T07:34:52] Yamal: Would you go alone or with a girl who will make dinner for you with the camping gas?
[2024-05-23T07:35:42] Noname: Women are ‚öìÔ∏è, alone thanks
[2024-05-23T07:36:54] haku: brokeback mountain in the woods haha
[2024-05-23T07:50:19] Yamal: Well, the vsett 11 would say that it is the same as the Zero 11, right?
[2024-05-23T07:51:44] Yamal: On the other hand, the vsett 10 would say that it is different from the zero 10
[2024-05-23T07:51:53] haku: no look similar but very different. vsett 11 has wolf style front suspension
[2024-05-23T07:52:41] Yamal: Yes ‚Ä¶. Suspension front
[2024-05-23T07:53:29] haku: imo the vsett 11 is the best vsett. its just space limited
[2024-05-23T07:53:39] Yamal: I don't understand why they say this type of motorcycle-type parallel suspensions are not good in terms of geometry..
[2024-05-23T07:54:08] haku: laotie best
[2024-05-23T07:54:36] Yamal: yes especially those who walk
[2024-05-23T07:54:38] Yamal: Heh
[2024-05-23T07:55:17] haku: yea i dont understand why they say that about those kind of suspensions.
[2024-05-23T07:55:33] Yamal: Also Williams is like this ‚Ä¶ ‚Äú‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù
[2024-05-23T07:56:49] haku: this is the one i like. i will find an auction for these
[2024-05-23T07:59:08] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-05-23T07:59:08] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-05-23T07:59:29] haku: nice helmet
[2024-05-23T08:05:00] Yamal: "yema" amazon... gift from my little brother when they bought me the dt thunder, he told me if you buy it, I'll buy you the helmet and there it is...
[2024-05-23T08:11:53] Yamal: little focer which one is it!!!!
[2024-05-23T08:22:06] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Does someone knows how do I chose suspension to much my weight? (Shocks for the zero10x)
[2024-05-23T08:28:01] Yamal: Normally it is specified in the lbs of the springs in relation to the weight/hardness in lbs of the springs, but this has not been of much use to me. The truth is, I think that in e-scooters, more hardness than what corresponds to you is good, because It gives you firmness and stability.
[2024-05-23T08:28:39] Yamal: If you do only field", okay... but if you do asphalt and you like to go fast, better hardness on the springs...
[2024-05-23T08:29:16] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Yes but I do I culocate this ?
[2024-05-23T08:30:26] Yamal: I don't know where I saw this, look at the spring specifications, some give you the relationship data.
[2024-05-23T09:06:15] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Shouldn't I includ scooter weight?
[2024-05-23T09:07:13] Yamal: No
[2024-05-23T09:07:39] Yamal: Rider weight
[2024-05-23T09:08:33] Yamal: I have 1800 lbs on nami (stock) and is soft..
[2024-05-23T09:09:29] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-05-23T09:18:34] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: How much do you weigh?
[2024-05-23T09:29:05] Yamal: 90
[2024-05-23T09:30:02] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Oh I'm 65-70
[2024-05-23T09:33:00] Yamal: What I mean is that from my experience I would not take shock absorbers for e-scooter with few lbs...
[2024-05-23T10:03:36] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: So 850lbs ?
[2024-05-23T10:05:30] NetworkDir: Do you want soft or medium?
[2024-05-23T10:05:47] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Medium
[2024-05-23T10:06:03] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Ride only on road
[2024-05-23T10:12:03] NetworkDir: Hmm zero stock suspensions are 1500 lbs You can put 1800lbs for rear and 2000lbs on front
[2024-05-23T10:12:38] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I don't want it to be harder
[2024-05-23T10:12:40] NetworkDir: Also for rear 165mm and for front you need something like 135mm
[2024-05-23T10:12:48] NetworkDir: So put 1500lbs
[2024-05-23T10:12:51] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I want more rebound
[2024-05-23T10:13:20] NetworkDir: For front i dont think you can put exa
[2024-05-23T10:13:31] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I'm getting 150 for the front since I'm going to get 11 inch motor for the rear
[2024-05-23T10:13:45] NetworkDir: Ah its good
[2024-05-23T10:13:49] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Why
[2024-05-23T10:14:32] NetworkDir: I mean stock suspension are 135-137mm and exa don't have a this size. But you said 150mm for 11 inch motor it's fine
[2024-05-23T10:14:52] NetworkDir: 165 rear 1500lbs 150 front 1500lbs
[2024-05-23T10:42:43] Yamal: Yeah yeah maracuyeah
[2024-05-23T10:44:46] sombre_enfant: Wich website ?
[2024-05-23T10:46:09] Yamal: Aliespress
[2024-05-23T10:46:30] Yamal: So fast, order last Saturday allmost night..
[2024-05-23T11:17:32] puneDir: 84100 doesnt die with bms cut
[2024-05-23T11:17:43] puneDir: My xt60 got removed while going 60kmh
[2024-05-23T11:17:52] puneDir: (While testing puneron)
[2024-05-23T11:30:13] Happy Giraffe: Has someone used a resistor in throttle between 5v and GND in order to avoid throttle going 100% if Signal cable is removed?
[2024-05-23T11:30:40] Happy Giraffe: Someone suggested to use it in some group but I'm not sure if it's a good idea
[2024-05-23T11:46:48] NetworkDir: i dont think its happend on reality (after remove signal cable 100% signal)
[2024-05-23T11:48:07] sombre_enfant: U do when u use resistor for adc
[2024-05-23T11:56:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: There's function on vesc to avoid that in last version
[2024-05-23T11:56:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: Just set max throttle voltage
[2024-05-23T12:18:37] Happy Giraffe: I cant as I use adc adapter
[2024-05-23T12:19:18] Happy Giraffe: Yes but this resistor was to avoid crash if signal accidentally disconnected
[2024-05-23T12:35:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: Why?
[2024-05-23T12:45:24] GABE: No alcohol for me.
[2024-05-23T12:45:37] GABE: I genuinely dislike it nowadays.
[2024-05-23T12:45:49] GABE: at least with weed you don't wanna die the day after
[2024-05-23T12:46:22] GABE: Lady goes on the back of the scoot bro time for an Ecar
[2024-05-23T12:47:54] Yamal: Better üëç
[2024-05-23T12:54:05] Yamal: You have to train, and eat well and healthy, for a powerful mind and a strong body!
[2024-05-23T12:57:32] Yamal: üåø from time to time, nothing happens, it's medicinalüòÅ
[2024-05-23T13:14:54] sombre_enfant: It should do it i dont understand your wiring and your idea
[2024-05-23T14:13:57] Happy Giraffe: Adc adapter has max output of like 2.1v even when shorted?
[2024-05-23T14:14:04] Happy Giraffe: Or would it go above 2.1? Then could set adc max 2.5 in example
[2024-05-23T19:13:03] Jacob: Hey i've asked it before but forgot to write down the name, what is a good beginner spot welder that wont break my bank?
[2024-05-23T19:51:45] Yamal: https://youtu.be/GA2cjipnkQ0?si=IdflsCyso2Op8F0T
[2024-05-23T19:52:05] Yamal: Tomorrow fridAy !!! üòÇ
[2024-05-23T20:38:59] JPPL: I use 1250lbs front 1500 back or 1350lbs
[2024-05-23T20:39:05] JPPL: Both normally 165
[2024-05-23T20:39:22] JPPL: Zero or blades 150 front goes amazing
[2024-05-23T20:39:31] JPPL: I have 78kg
[2024-05-23T20:39:52] JPPL: I have a lot of parelelipipedos
[2024-05-23T20:39:53] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. JPPL has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-05-23T20:52:02] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I'm 70 max so go lower
[2024-05-23T20:57:49] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: ‚ùî
[2024-05-23T21:52:24] haku: you replacing those yourself?
[2024-05-23T22:10:33] JPPL: I would be around that lbs
[2024-05-23T22:14:09] Yamal: No! a friend replaced him
[2024-05-23T22:15:05] haku: i wonder how difficult it is to replace those
[2024-05-23T22:18:39] sombre_enfant: Ez
[2024-05-23T22:19:37] haku: i try to mess around with it with just an iron. i always break the legs
[2024-05-23T22:20:33] haku: smd stuff next level
[2024-05-23T22:20:38] Patrick: The EVE INR21700-40P also looks pretty good 50A Discharge rated
[2024-05-23T22:22:36] sombre_enfant: Because u need hot air not soldering iron
[2024-05-23T22:33:09] Patrick: Had a internal resistance of max 7mOhm
[2024-05-23T22:34:02] Patrick: Also in some tests they had less heat development then the molicel p42a
[2024-05-23T22:35:12] Patrick: What nope
[2024-05-23T22:35:19] Patrick: 120Cells tested
[2024-05-23T22:35:26] Patrick: Lowest was 5mOhm
[2024-05-23T22:36:33] Patrick: So you trying to tell me that the tester of me and 3 other guys failed even when they worked fine before?
[2024-05-23T22:36:45] Patrick: Sounds pretty unrealistic
[2024-05-23T22:37:04] Patrick: 5-7mOhm
[2024-05-23T22:38:35] Patrick: Just saying its pretty unrealistic that 3 different testers fail
[2024-05-23T22:40:34] Patrick: The one guy even used the same tester like in that videoüíÄ
[2024-05-23T22:49:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Need see x3a resistance
[2024-05-23T23:04:37] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: So 800-1000
[2024-05-23T23:26:23] haku: what is realistic discharge for this 40p? 45a?
[2024-05-23T23:29:42] GABE: 40 I'd say
[2024-05-23T23:32:20] haku: james said similar to 40t3 and p42a. so 45
[2024-05-23T23:34:39] haku: all i need to know is i need to hoard cells for the end of days when cells become currency

[2024-05-24T08:01:05] Yamal: yesterday I heard that they now come with reinforced or improved winding, and that with FW they can reach up to 55kmh
[2024-05-24T08:10:01] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: You about motor or esc or what
[2024-05-24T08:10:32] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Reinforced yeah, but anyway I need to resolder 2 ADC resistors and 2 caps(already did caps)
[2024-05-24T08:10:55] Yamal: Motor

[2024-05-24T19:24:47] Yamal: People, when did the couple of 85/250 stay for who for the group,,?
[2024-05-24T19:25:47] sombre_enfant: Speaking in fortnite term again ?
[2024-05-24T19:26:41] Yamal: speaking in silver brother, euros and not dollars
[2024-05-24T19:41:31] Yamal: the arrangement of the little Focer,, it continues to fail, and we would have to try with new components,, I want to consider all the options of possible controllers that I have so that when the time comes I decide on one or the other..., we are immersed in the good weather season and we cannot waste time

[2024-05-24T20:10:48] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2024-05-24T20:32:07] Jacob: Got rid of the tractor sound üòÜ set it up again, but i think motor poles/gear ratio may be wrong
[2024-05-24T20:32:47] Jacob: But its torque is very slow and the motor saturates slow
[2024-05-24T20:33:21] Jacob: Could it be motor poles that are set wrong, they're at 14 but i dont know the correct value for this motor Any way to find out how many motor poles without opening it?
[2024-05-24T20:33:24] Jacob: <photos/photo_15139@24-05-2024_20-33-24.jpg>

[2024-05-24T21:16:28] Patrick: I only tested 12 at the moment had nearly the same results
[2024-05-24T21:22:43] Patrick: Me and the other 2 guys bought them from Nkon
[2024-05-24T21:29:02] Patrick: I know that youre confused i am too
[2024-05-24T21:29:09] Patrick: Cell just way to good for 3‚Ç¨ per piece
[2024-05-24T21:30:19] Patrick: It also cost 3‚Ç¨ per piece
[2024-05-24T21:30:30] Patrick: Eve is little weird for me all the cells are cheap
[2024-05-24T21:30:51] Patrick: How
[2024-05-24T21:31:13] Patrick: Reclaimed cells?
[2024-05-24T21:31:21] haku: good for you bud. even if they price it to $2 i wouldnt use china batteries
[2024-05-24T21:31:43] Patrick: Eve is a legit company
[2024-05-24T21:31:49] Patrick: So wouldnt say china batteries
[2024-05-24T21:37:24] haku: china marketing is what i meant. im a chinaman but cant trust em
[2024-05-24T21:38:22] Patrick: Still pretty good
[2024-05-24T21:38:35] Patrick: Cant wait for the Eve with 5.6Ah
[2024-05-24T21:38:59] Patrick: Eve claims 1000 Cycles
[2024-05-24T21:39:27] Patrick: No datasheet available just know its a 3C cell
[2024-05-24T21:40:38] Patrick: Yea still if the eve even gets close to that at lets say 1C its great
[2024-05-24T21:40:57] Patrick: Since high discharge isnt possible Cell-Level fusing is interesting
[2024-05-24T21:41:52] Patrick: With the tesla chemistry?
[2024-05-24T21:42:02] haku: maybe just available in china market.
[2024-05-24T21:42:09] Patrick: Tesla found a new Cell chemistry
[2024-05-24T21:42:16] haku: they do no export crap all the time
[2024-05-24T21:42:18] Patrick: Some months ago
[2024-05-24T21:46:49] haku: eve 40pl is such a huge jump in performance. its hard to believe
[2024-05-24T21:47:47] haku: recycle the copper my guy
[2024-05-24T21:58:46] GABE: will get recycled in respect to time.
[2024-05-24T22:11:00] Jacob: Hey it's like my motor gets saturated very slowly? Any idea which settings to look at?
[2024-05-24T22:22:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: Btw motor saturation doesn't depends by time, is all about current
[2024-05-24T22:30:38] Jacob: But its still weird its during acceleration is kinda powerless and vibrating/jittery. Even tho current is at 40a and 60a for motor, should be enough for a small 450w motor to accelerate smoothly
[2024-05-24T22:36:16] Happy Giraffe: Called itüòÇ
[2024-05-24T22:36:43] Happy Giraffe: And Mooch says its a good 45A cell in the endüòÅ
[2024-05-24T22:38:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: That's the point, is overcurrent
[2024-05-24T22:38:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: How is set your hall sensor erpm?
[2024-05-24T22:41:31] Jacob: Oh so it because i set it too high?
[2024-05-24T22:41:45] Jacob: <photos/photo_15140@24-05-2024_22-41-45.jpg>
[2024-05-24T22:42:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Go to foc -> hall sensor
[2024-05-24T22:42:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: And take acreenshot
[2024-05-24T22:43:18] Jacob: <photos/photo_15141@24-05-2024_22-43-18.jpg>
[2024-05-24T22:48:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: Maybe is you're talking about observer
[2024-05-24T22:49:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: Go to foc->advanced Observer -> Ortega original
[2024-05-24T22:49:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: It works better on oversaturated motors
[2024-05-24T22:50:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: And set your inductance 15% lower
[2024-05-24T22:50:40] Jacob: Hmmm its already on Ortega original
[2024-05-24T22:50:56] Jacob: <photos/photo_15142@24-05-2024_22-50-56.jpg>
[2024-05-24T22:52:24] Jacob: But i'll try setting the current lower
[2024-05-24T22:54:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: Send me screen of foc sensor less page
[2024-05-24T22:55:57] Jacob: Some of the page
[2024-05-24T22:55:57] Jacob: <photos/photo_15144@24-05-2024_22-55-57.jpg>
[2024-05-24T23:03:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Foc general Sorry
[2024-05-24T23:04:31] Jacob: :)
[2024-05-24T23:04:31] Jacob: <photos/photo_15146@24-05-2024_23-04-31.jpg>
[2024-05-24T23:11:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is very high the measured inductance, what vesc you have?
[2024-05-24T23:11:49] Jacob: I have the Ubox lite :) 100v 100a
[2024-05-24T23:13:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: Try to set 300uH in motor inductance, see if it goes better
[2024-05-24T23:14:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: Normally for those motors max is like 200
[2024-05-24T23:15:48] Jacob: Thanks i'll try it:)
[2024-05-24T23:27:53] haku: he tested it?
[2024-05-24T23:28:43] haku: is it availble on youtube? the test?
[2024-05-24T23:29:45] Jacob: Hmmm think got a bit better but issue still persist ü§î

[2024-05-24T23:58:31] haku: is this ai?
[2024-05-25T00:03:07] Yamal: ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.
[2024-05-25T00:04:55] haku: i would rock that. put a big basket in the back and all set
[2024-05-25T00:10:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: Try 200
[2024-05-25T00:11:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: By experience normally it is 150, but do some test
[2024-05-25T00:11:51] Happy Giraffe: Not yet I think

[2024-05-25T00:16:04] haku: nice. what bike is this? and have you got your tronic fixed?
[2024-05-25T00:17:39] Unknown: Roadrunner rr. I went dual nd72450 FarDrivers. Did not get the Tronics fixed
[2024-05-25T00:18:40] Unknown: It‚Äôs just insane. Best bang for the buck..
[2024-05-25T00:18:48] haku: thats awsome bro!
[2024-05-25T00:19:11] haku: yes. ive noticed folks saying this about fardrivers too.
[2024-05-25T00:19:31] Unknown: Thank you bro. You need to try it out.
[2024-05-25T00:21:20] haku: that seems to be the choice for high powered bikes. you NY boys are crazy
[2024-05-25T00:21:55] Unknown: I originally wanted to do FarDriver but the customer wanted a Tronic build. Then he kept complaining about wanting me to turn it up more on the takeoff. ü§ïü§ï
[2024-05-25T00:22:45] Unknown: You know that the city moves fast.
[2024-05-25T00:23:40] Yamal: So you definitely keep the FarDrives,?
[2024-05-25T00:25:33] Unknown: <video_file>
[2024-05-25T00:25:34] Unknown: <video_file>
[2024-05-25T00:26:29] Yamal: The truth is that many FarDrives look powerful, the new Wepeds have them apart from many motorcycles I think,,, but vesc tool watches really catch you
[2024-05-25T00:27:24] Yamal: üï∞‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•üï∞‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•üï∞‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
[2024-05-25T00:27:37] haku: i like vesc for scooters. small can fit anywhere. for bigger pevs theres alot of space for bigger esc
[2024-05-25T00:28:06] Unknown: Definitely. Keeping. The bike is dialed down to half of the battery max. Phased amps maxed @ 450a motors barely get warm. Rear is on line throttle and front is on eco but wheels spin at 50mph
[2024-05-25T00:29:12] Yamal: Top speed?
[2024-05-25T00:38:48] Unknown: Makes perfect sense. Where space is limited +. Vesc is awesome but lacking big power. It‚Äôs also very efficient when tuned right
[2024-05-25T00:41:17] Yamal: https://youtu.be/CjXqVVQqzUU?si=kyvfkitfPlk6GYwe
[2024-05-25T00:42:23] Unknown: https://www.facebook.com/share/v/Z7AgWMahpzYUJNm3/?mibextid=WC7FNe watch my video if you have time. You will see how I command the streets. Nothing stays in front of me üòÇ
[2024-05-25T00:44:30] Yamal: depends on the esc model,, I have seen here 700 and 800A phase of some
[2024-05-25T00:45:14] Unknown: I did 67mph and backed off. I figure I‚Äôll do 80mph easily you can feel the power plus wheelspin at hard throttle.
[2024-05-25T00:46:18] Yamal: also scooter with vesc that can reach 160kmh or the new Apex that I bought you well know with the x12 accelerating it barely moves from the spot...
[2024-05-25T00:47:58] Unknown: Every builder complains about wanting more power from vesc. Ves loves high voltage but hates high current. 3shuls are roasting too.
[2024-05-25T00:48:58] Yamal: How is your battery Roh,,?
[2024-05-25T00:49:55] Yamal: By the way, did you manage to see the new Apex?
[2024-05-25T00:51:26] Unknown: Rions are very light so anything with make it fast. Put the same controller in something heavier . Power vs weight . Have the Tronic 750 & it‚Äôs not better than my sabvaton 72150 as far as hitting top speed
[2024-05-25T00:51:28] haku: vesc probably have the best software and tech. fardriver is just brute power and bang for buck from what ive read.
[2024-05-25T00:52:37] haku: its like american v8 vs german v8 lol
[2024-05-25T00:53:44] Unknown: Vesc software & tuning is A+. There‚Äôs a wealth of parameters yet to be mastered. FarDriver is big and ugly but just works well
[2024-05-25T00:54:16] Yamal: Do you know the kw you generate with your fardrive?
[2024-05-25T00:55:25] Yamal: Also FarDrive has FW?
[2024-05-25T01:03:30] Unknown: Yes it has field weakening and regen. I‚Äôm on of the few guys to figure out the regen. Most people don‚Äôt use it because it‚Äôs a little tricky to figure out. It literally progresses
[2024-05-25T01:04:36] Unknown: 32,400
[2024-05-25T01:05:28] Yamal: Do you know people who are using x12 there on the other side of the pond?
[2024-05-25T01:09:39] Yamal: By the way, what do you think of the Tronic 250r based on your experience or that of people close to you? I ask you because you own Tronic as well as American.üòÅü§ô
[2024-05-25T01:17:09] Unknown: Over rated overpriced
[2024-05-25T01:33:05] Yamal: Now they are at $250 in America... I also had a problem with one of the plates, but I have been enjoying it like a baby for a few months, with the highest torque I have ever had in my life and no problems, with literally a pinch of FW It took off... I know there have been a lot of problems with the Tronic but hey, I'm talking about my experience with them...
[2024-05-25T01:37:03] Yamal: I'm looking forward to seeing the x12 working, but maybe I'm talking like that because I consider myself a lover of the Rion brand despite the barrage of criticism against the brand, many of them with reason. Leo assures that all the models on the "black" list are being delivered and that it will reach each and every one of those who paid for their scooter at the time...üòî
[2024-05-25T01:50:39] haku: you have a tronic 250r?
[2024-05-25T01:53:12] haku: he has a tronic 750 i think. the big boy
[2024-05-25T02:54:04] Unknown: I have a 750 also. Crazy torque but lacking top speed
[2024-05-25T03:14:24] rosheee: tronic 250R runs 2 hot
[2024-05-25T03:32:49] Unknown: Does go faster than 67mph. Sabvoton 72150 was giving me 75+mph & I‚Äôve gotten over 85mph with unlocked 72150. I love the 750 just want the same speed or more
[2024-05-25T03:36:56] Unknown: Done all that. My axle is broken üò° right now so I‚Äôm planning on going QS273 with statorade & dump some Amps into it
[2024-05-25T03:38:41] Unknown: I was saying the same thing
[2024-05-25T03:50:26] Happy Giraffe: Ebike?üò≥
[2024-05-25T04:33:51] haku: @jamessoderstrom do you know how to tighten this part of vsett. always getting loose.
[2024-05-25T04:34:00] haku: <photos/photo_15150@25-05-2024_04-34-00.jpg>
[2024-05-25T04:35:18] haku: gotcha. that sucks. i like how it folds
[2024-05-25T04:42:53] Noname: I put a rag on mine and cranked them with channel locks. Never came loose again
[2024-05-25T04:45:52] rosheee: yes
[2024-05-25T04:46:18] haku: what do you mean rags? can you still fold it?
[2024-05-25T04:46:45] Noname: So it didn't scratch and No not without pliers again
[2024-05-25T04:47:17] rosheee: right setup then goes faster ^^' tronic 250 goes faster than 67 mph xD
[2024-05-25T04:49:47] haku: how you like the x12 so far?
[2024-05-25T04:50:11] rosheee: i just did setup on it ^^
[2024-05-25T04:50:21] rosheee: never road test
[2024-05-25T04:52:02] rosheee: in max 2 weeks
[2024-05-25T04:55:10] rosheee: BUT ....
[2024-05-25T04:55:10] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. roscheeee has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-05-25T04:57:44] haku: x12 is the trampa 500 equivalent yea?
[2024-05-25T04:58:50] haku: oh wow
[2024-05-25T04:59:09] haku: isnt there a tronic equivalent to that?
[2024-05-25T05:00:49] haku: that will turn heads for sure.
[2024-05-25T05:01:45] haku: is there a new 6mosfet tronic with tol mosfets?
[2024-05-25T05:12:27] haku: as of now the trampa 500 is the emoto vesc yea?
[2024-05-25T05:19:44] haku: looks like there is a waitlist for trampa 500
[2024-05-25T05:20:01] haku: or maybe not available to US
[2024-05-25T05:30:12] haku: i wish i can afford it lol.
[2024-05-25T05:30:44] haku: maybe they will take 4 payments of 200

[2024-05-25T07:57:23] Rose: Hey there josef, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-05-25T08:00:20] Tan Sean: Good morning üëå I need a little bit of help from someone if they have the time. To make sure I understand everything correctly: My Spinted can output a maximum of 75V and 200A? Are the 200A referring to the battery or motor amps? It must refer to the battery, right? Otherwise, I couldn‚Äôt output/receive 120A per motor from the controller. So, if I have a battery with a BMS that has a 150A discharge capacity, could I get more power? This mostly affects acceleration because the electron flow depends on the voltage, which is for top speed. These so-called 150A could only be used for more field weakening to achieve higher top speed? The controller can only send as many amps to the motors as the BMS allows? Is that correct?
[2024-05-25T09:34:59] Yamal: No, now only 1little Focer (same old Tronic 250)
[2024-05-25T09:37:23] Yamal: has the R's on the small bike
[2024-05-25T10:05:25] Tan Sean: Can i use a 72V batteey for dual 75V/200A?
[2024-05-25T10:07:30] Yamal: 72 or 20 s?
[2024-05-25T10:07:37] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/DpzplZOdKxE?si=HbTNBm_GhLGzOh_h

[2024-05-25T10:29:47] haku: im not sure but i think you can for the ubox
[2024-05-25T10:30:22] Tan Sean: Thank you, check it out further
[2024-05-25T10:34:55] Tan Sean: Cant go above 18s üò¢
[2024-05-25T10:35:11] Yamal: Need fine ESC for 85v, Becaouse you with full battery 84,2
[2024-05-25T10:36:18] Tan Sean: Have you something in mind, except nukular?
[2024-05-25T10:37:13] haku: get 2 spintend 85/150
[2024-05-25T10:38:04] haku: or 85/250
[2024-05-25T10:39:56] haku: if you live in EU. you can get them from @jamessoderstrom. he can also guide you on what components to use
[2024-05-25T10:40:40] haku: or jrev store.
[2024-05-25T10:41:00] Yamal: In America where ?üòÅ
[2024-05-25T10:41:24] haku: from my wife amy
[2024-05-25T10:43:24] Yamal: Alien Rides still alive?
[2024-05-25T10:44:02] haku: yes but they dont sell i think. only curry vesc
[2024-05-25T10:44:47] Tan Sean: Okay bought always from spinted. Live in the eu! Thanks for the info
[2024-05-25T10:45:07] Tan Sean: Spinted better then Flipsky?
[2024-05-25T10:45:24] haku: from what ive read yes
[2024-05-25T10:45:48] Yamal: I already know it ,,, I say this because he is very stuck on his YouTube channel, he misses it
[2024-05-25T10:50:06] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yes
[2024-05-25T10:50:15] Yamal: It was recently said that flipsky is better for high voltage than spintend, right?
[2024-05-25T10:50:16] Rogerio Figueiredo: But also expensive
[2024-05-25T10:50:23] Rogerio Figueiredo: Wrong
[2024-05-25T10:51:03] haku: who said this?
[2024-05-25T10:51:08] Yamal: dreamed open it then neighbor
[2024-05-25T10:52:02] Tan Sean: What is with stormcore controller? Would be dual, so i dont need two? Is that correct?
[2024-05-25T10:56:29] Yamal: The other day talking to Paolo vs Flipsky style, do you remember something similar was said?
[2024-05-25T10:57:51] haku: unfortunately not. i remember him calling it shitsky aswell as others
[2024-05-25T10:59:21] haku: i think the 2 is very similar but spintend is just better engineered
[2024-05-25T11:01:26] NetworkDir: anyway flipsky are trash
[2024-05-25T11:01:30] Yamal: <photos/photo_15151@25-05-2024_11-01-30.jpg>
[2024-05-25T11:02:59] haku: dam 1152 cells in that bike. also no mechanical brake wich is sketch
[2024-05-25T11:03:20] NetworkDir: yes flipsky can handle on higher voltage but for 20s performance spintend the best
[2024-05-25T11:06:42] haku: can flipsky do 22s with regen?
[2024-05-25T11:12:44] sombre_enfant: Flipsky 75450 how many mos? I might give it a try theres also mode for encoder
[2024-05-25T11:29:28] haku: isnt that the watercooled vesc?
[2024-05-25T11:29:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: 20s freewheel and puffüí®
[2024-05-25T11:30:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you want use field weakening or mtpa not suggested with 6.02 firmware
[2024-05-25T11:31:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: However both are Chinese ESC, and works good. Maybe spintend bit more reliable
[2024-05-25T11:31:23] NetworkDir: i use field weakening and 20s freewheel without problem
[2024-05-25T11:31:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: With small and low kV motor everything is different
[2024-05-25T11:33:02] NetworkDir: what problem with 6.02? on 6.05 no problem?
[2024-05-25T11:33:11] Yamal: Well, why do spintend people charge you in American dollars when they are Chinese? customs, fees, taxes, transportation...
[2024-05-25T11:35:54] haku: every seller uses US dollar.
[2024-05-25T11:37:07] Yamal: Yes, in reality, if they charge in dollars, they send from China and you eat customs with fries... the good thing about Alliespress is that 90% of you don't pay customs...
[2024-05-25T11:38:31] NetworkDir: Yep ofc both are chinese. at least they don't use fake/clone/used chips xD
[2024-05-25T11:40:51] haku: i love china products. very affordable compared to western stuff but that the thing that gets me is the false marketing.
[2024-05-25T11:41:20] haku: well tronic is also known for that so I guess not china only
[2024-05-25T11:42:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: I pay them with Chinese yuan directly and tell them to send me with custom tax free line
[2024-05-25T11:43:02] haku: mr. paulo has every currency in his wallet
[2024-05-25T11:43:30] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yeah it does
[2024-05-25T11:43:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: Or not
[2024-05-25T11:43:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: Never said
[2024-05-25T11:44:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: I just say people always blame about flipsky , but it's not the only.
[2024-05-25T11:44:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: Only euro USD and china currency
[2024-05-25T11:46:59] Yamal: look! your favorite!
[2024-05-25T11:47:46] haku: pretty
[2024-05-25T11:48:07] haku: lol the magura carpet.

[2024-05-25T14:09:55] sombre_enfant: Design issue its since lower ring dont heat as much as the upper braking contact one idk who made this design but he was geekin in the process
[2024-05-25T14:17:15] haku: its a nice looking disc brake. didnt jan and rochee design that?
[2024-05-25T14:43:34] Happy Giraffe: I dont think its a design issue, it seems like a decent model. As stainless wont conduct heat well its good to have those thinner parts in between so disc stays more flat and wont start to warp
[2024-05-25T14:48:04] Face de Pin Suc√©: We use brakestuff but different design and NEVER had this problem
[2024-05-25T14:51:50] Happy Giraffe: Yeah usually designed niceüòÅ
[2024-05-25T14:52:16] Happy Giraffe: Small company with bad products would go bankrupt quite quicklyüòÖ
[2024-05-25T15:03:33] sombre_enfant: Its a design issue
[2024-05-25T15:04:16] sombre_enfant: Only way u can do 2 circle in a disc is by making them float disc otherwise this happen
[2024-05-25T15:08:54] Jan: I told torsten about this, he wouldnt listen
[2024-05-25T15:09:06] Jan: I suggested not to do this half a year ago
[2024-05-25T15:18:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: Should try vented disc like cars
[2024-05-25T15:20:39] Happy Giraffe: Oh now I saw it flips around lol, watched video too quicklyüòÇ
[2024-05-25T15:24:19] Happy Giraffe: Hope v4üî•
[2024-05-25T15:26:33] haku: ita should be 1 solid thick piece and a few slots. like a car or motorcycle. but to one takes me seriously
[2024-05-25T15:27:30] Happy Giraffe: Haha, need wider caliper
[2024-05-25T15:27:45] Happy Giraffe: And not toy sized pads
[2024-05-25T15:27:56] haku: scooters should have motorcycle grade brakes too. the speeds they reach is not like bicycles
[2024-05-25T15:28:20] Happy Giraffe: Interesting to see how the 20year old Hopes perform
[2024-05-25T15:28:35] haku: specially with mineral oil lol
[2024-05-25T15:30:38] haku: someone should put moto brembo on a scooter and make that the trend
[2024-05-25T15:37:42] Happy Giraffe: Now there's a new Chinese titanium brake coming for Surrons, Lewis was the name I think. 6 pistons and not sure how thick rotor or pad area

[2024-05-25T15:45:41] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I think a marketing scam and a mediocre product for premium money
[2024-05-25T15:46:22] Rose: Hey there Dimitry, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-05-25T15:47:01] haku: it looks solid
[2024-05-25T15:48:19] Happy Giraffe: Lets see this vs. Hope v4 when it comes out
[2024-05-25T15:49:30] haku: the photo in the website just looks shady because its taken with a phone camera with a messy background. they should hire a product photographer lol
[2024-05-25T15:58:21] haku: looks nice. all metal parts. https://revrides.com/products/volar-sport-4-pistons-motorcycle-quality-hydraulic-brake-systems
[2024-05-25T15:58:50] haku: its still bicycle brakes though
[2024-05-25T16:24:40] Happy Giraffe: This is standard bike pad vs theirs? Not bad
[2024-05-25T16:26:47] Happy Giraffe: Tell us the exact model of your esc, its not usually about the max amps it can push but for how long it depends on cooling design of vesc and how you mounted it
[2024-05-25T16:29:54] Happy Giraffe: Controller basically just transforms the wanted wattage of power from battery to motor current. Lets say with 50A battery current you can usually achieve motor peak currents of around ~120A during the start
[2024-05-25T16:34:16] Happy Giraffe: Motor Behaviour in relation to Voltage, Phase Current and Battery Current: Here is what happens if you only change battery current limit: Battery consumption won‚Äôt change up till same rpm(speed) because phase current is the limit. Fast = full phase amp acceleration will continue up till higher rpm. Max power will be higher because - example, at previous max speed 60kmh voltage was 45v and phase current was limited by battery limit obviously. So by increasing battery limit we now have more room for phase amps at those same 45v (60kmh) meaning we can get to higher max speed

[2024-05-25T23:04:03] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-05-25T23:05:03] Rose: Hey there NetworkDir, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-05-25T23:05:58] NetworkDir: Hmm we can't test but looks yes
[2024-05-25T23:07:09] NetworkDir: @jamessoderstrom sorry for tag i will ask how much regen phase i can use safely ? Now i put 40A and 15A battery current I ask because my brake pads done fastly..
[2024-05-25T23:09:18] Happy Giraffe: I would use the batt cell datasheet max charge amps and drop them a little, for phase if motor is stable mounted with no play in axle maybe 70% of phase current you use to go forward, test and see if motor starts to go brr :D
[2024-05-25T23:10:04] Happy Giraffe: iex. 3A charge per cell and 5p pack would use something like -12A batt regen current
[2024-05-25T23:10:20] NetworkDir: XD 70% of phase current are 100A
[2024-05-25T23:10:55] NetworkDir: Yeah i know about battery current 15A-15A should fine for my 11 parallel packs But i ask about phase
[2024-05-25T23:11:14] Happy Giraffe: yeah if you need strong brake, however increase it a littlebit at a time so you can see if errors occur, like 40->60A phase regen first etc
[2024-05-25T23:11:57] NetworkDir: Sadly my brake sensors are switch if like g30 they have a hall sensor i easily can put more currents
[2024-05-25T23:12:13] Happy Giraffe: if your battery is 11p then you should use more batt current regen aswell if strong brake is needed, use like 20
[2024-05-25T23:12:33] NetworkDir: But i have dual setup it's should 15+15 ?
[2024-05-25T23:12:34] Happy Giraffe: tho bms must support this aswell
[2024-05-25T23:13:08] Happy Giraffe: @jamessoderstrom tell him mr. dual motor xd
[2024-05-25T23:13:48] Happy Giraffe: yeah, battery and vesc useful to have 2.8v cut :D
[2024-05-25T23:14:03] NetworkDir: Already i use 15A - 15A battery current and 20-25A phase but 25A for phase very low so something like 50A should fine
[2024-05-25T23:14:31] NetworkDir: I dont want fuckeria regen just help to better stop and more pad lifes XD
[2024-05-25T23:15:11] Happy Giraffe: then that should be plenty, just try -60A phase and -80A phase
[2024-05-25T23:17:15] NetworkDir: Yeah sure. Thanks for answering guys have a good night/day <3
[2024-05-25T23:17:34] Happy Giraffe: get a dedicated throttle to regen
[2024-05-25T23:17:52] NetworkDir: XD good idea
[2024-05-25T23:18:10] Happy Giraffe: Im still confused why everyone isnt doing this, Im always speaking like my own setup so I have left throttle for regen, its so nice
[2024-05-25T23:18:33] haku: <video_file>
[2024-05-25T23:19:13] NetworkDir: No it's fine i see on some snsc Also rion throttle have a this option i think

[2024-05-25T23:21:39] puneDir: I dont have brakes now

[2024-05-25T23:53:42] Yamal: Ragemechanic Instagram there are information
[2024-05-25T23:53:48] Yamal: But I no can go in..
[2024-05-25T23:54:09] Yamal: In one group nami telegram they tell me

[2024-05-26T00:09:18] puneDir: some stupid guys call e bikes - scoots gay
[2024-05-26T00:10:27] haku: unfortunately thats the look scooters get in the US. i dont care im proud

[2024-05-26T00:58:16] haku: you got both working?
[2024-05-26T01:07:19] Yamal: I hope... but no, we have to order more components to continue testing...
[2024-05-26T01:08:20] haku: what component is broken?
[2024-05-26T01:08:49] haku: it might be cheaper to get a spintend 6fet than replacing parts
[2024-05-26T01:09:44] haku: maybe you can get the new mini spintends. seems cool product
[2024-05-26T01:23:10] Yamal: Well, I don't know the name now,,, In the same way, I will have to decide on a new driver to be able to move quickly, and nothing waiting to make money and see what I do.
[2024-05-26T01:25:10] Yamal: The truth is I'm not interested in small controllers, since I started with the modifications apart from enhancing the scooter to be able to have days on the circuit and enjoy... and nothing to see if I can achieve it
[2024-05-26T01:28:52] haku: how about 12fet.
[2024-05-26T01:30:34] puneDir: Probably on top speed too

[2024-05-26T03:29:49] haku: nice.
[2024-05-26T03:30:11] haku: theres usually a regular ev charger next to tesla stations too
[2024-05-26T03:31:54] Noname: Oh snap regen is phase and battery I gotta look what I did
[2024-05-26T03:33:32] Noname: Not here. Some tesla/ DC only / high kw and then j1772. I like country rides but it's a bit hard to make it through farm land.
[2024-05-26T03:34:17] Noname: If they work there's 2 places they don't and 1 high kw that porks us.
[2024-05-26T03:35:01] Noname: Eat and charge otherwise it's a time waster. Took 12 hrs today
[2024-05-26T03:35:46] haku: dang. thats the only thing i hate about evs on long routes.
[2024-05-26T03:36:12] Noname: Well it's 10mph average with charging time.
[2024-05-26T03:36:41] Noname: Yeah I was the slow charger at 2kw today üòí
[2024-05-26T03:37:05] Noname: Buddy's euc charges at 3.3kw
[2024-05-26T03:37:06] haku: how did the spintend handle those long rides? no problems?
[2024-05-26T03:38:01] Noname: It's dreamy but I need cruise controll hooked up. I lead so my speed and I had mad hand cramps
[2024-05-26T03:38:58] haku: you have trigger throttle yea? get a spinny2.
[2024-05-26T03:40:30] Noname: Have a spinny Idk if it's for me. Thumb x300 throttle.
[2024-05-26T03:40:49] Noname: It's hours and hours of pushing it
[2024-05-26T03:43:55] Noname: The charging stops are good. Time to chat and take a break but do sometimes become annoying
[2024-05-26T03:44:23] haku: how many in group?
[2024-05-26T03:45:17] Noname: Today 2 tmrw 3 or 4
[2024-05-26T03:45:48] Noname: It's a secret group of 5
[2024-05-26T03:46:07] haku: lucky you have friends that ride scooters. im shunned here
[2024-05-26T03:46:42] haku: the surron boys laugh at me üò≠
[2024-05-26T03:46:54] Noname: Otherwise main groups have a few hundred people from a few states. Anything more than 5 is a pain and the logistics become overwhelming for the planner
[2024-05-26T03:47:24] Noname: Saw a surron today of course he had to wheelie for us
[2024-05-26T03:51:21] JPPL: <photos/photo_15181@26-05-2024_03-51-21.jpg>
[2024-05-26T03:52:10] haku: i hope its real deal. this battery can change the world
[2024-05-26T03:52:51] Noname: @Bradhaku search Facebook you'll find people
[2024-05-26T03:53:49] Noname: But you need a working scooter
[2024-05-26T03:53:52] Noname: <sticker>
[2024-05-26T03:55:40] haku: las vegas isnt really a friendly city to scooters imo. but ill look for some groups
[2024-05-26T03:57:00] haku: theres only a handful of scooters ive seen here. when i drive i always give em a thumbs up
[2024-05-26T03:57:37] haku: they might think theres that creepy old man again.
[2024-05-26T03:58:12] Noname: Vegas or Utah where do you live lol
[2024-05-26T03:58:36] haku: vegas bro. its not the same haha. utah is beautiful
[2024-05-26T03:59:04] haku: vegas is a dirty desert.
[2024-05-26T03:59:27] Noname: Vegas is small as shit
[2024-05-26T03:59:39] haku: it is.
[2024-05-26T04:00:00] Noname: I could ride the whole thing on 1 charge
[2024-05-26T04:00:13] haku: they dont even allow scooters on the strip
[2024-05-26T04:00:28] Noname: Bullocks
[2024-05-26T04:00:52] haku: yea. you cant on the sidewalk.
[2024-05-26T04:01:25] Noname: I drive everywhere no fucks given
[2024-05-26T04:01:51] Noname: Except the highway did that once and it was slightly terrifying
[2024-05-26T04:40:37] Noname: Only üòÜ but they get super hot I was skim reading
[2024-05-26T04:40:51] Noname: Pre production last year made by eve
[2024-05-26T04:41:01] Noname: Prob not going to be a thing
[2024-05-26T04:42:27] Noname: https://endless-sphere.com/sphere/threads/tabless-design-cylindrical-cells-tests.122072/
[2024-05-26T04:45:05] Noname: What do you need 100a discharge for that's mad. Like 30a capable and 6+ah be good
[2024-05-26T04:46:03] haku: for small evs or ev drag racing maybe
[2024-05-26T04:46:20] Noname: Or just a little bigger 25750 mabey square cells
[2024-05-26T04:46:30] haku: 100a on a 21700 is crazy
[2024-05-26T04:46:58] Noname: <animation>
[2024-05-26T04:47:19] Noname: Oops I forgot the insulator ring

[2024-05-26T13:50:25] NetworkDir: <video_file>
[2024-05-26T13:50:37] NetworkDir: I test today voltage higher than 84V it's normal?
[2024-05-26T13:56:50] NetworkDir: So i put 3A-3A batt regen for safety
[2024-05-26T13:58:14] NetworkDir: Normally vesc should disable regen when battery is full
[2024-05-26T14:00:11] NetworkDir: With 3A results looks better
[2024-05-26T14:01:13] NetworkDir: Actually i dont want regen i need ebrake
[2024-05-26T14:08:47] Happy Giraffe: I just charge to 96% and that way cells last forever and always have room for regenüòÅ
[2024-05-26T14:17:41] Happy Giraffe: PETG CF benchy with 0.6mm nozzle in under 13 minsüò≥
[2024-05-26T14:18:45] Happy Giraffe: All details supee cleanüëÄ
[2024-05-26T14:19:10] Happy Giraffe: @Bradhaku We have joined the dark side
[2024-05-26T15:16:49] NetworkDir: IOS moment üò≠
[2024-05-26T15:17:15] Mirono escooters: Buy a real phone :D
[2024-05-26T15:17:22] Mirono escooters: :(
[2024-05-26T15:17:43] NetworkDir: I just use iphone for OS I hate android
[2024-05-26T15:39:25] Mirono escooters: Rofl
[2024-05-26T16:37:59] haku: good! good! let the hate flow through you!
[2024-05-26T16:38:34] haku: wich bambu is this?
[2024-05-26T16:39:12] Happy Giraffe: A1 miniüòÅ
[2024-05-26T16:39:36] haku: nice!
[2024-05-26T16:39:57] haku: easy mode isnt it? lol
[2024-05-26T16:40:25] Happy Giraffe: YesüòÖ
[2024-05-26T16:40:57] Happy Giraffe: Basically insanity
[2024-05-26T16:41:20] Happy Giraffe: At less than half the price of the ender...
[2024-05-26T16:41:42] haku: the next path to the dark side is a surron with a fardriver
[2024-05-26T16:42:45] haku: only think i dont like about it that its not open source like enders.
[2024-05-26T16:42:58] Happy Giraffe: Surron kinda in weird spot, too bulky and heavy for bicycle but too little power for e motoüòÅ
[2024-05-26T16:43:33] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, but spare parts being cheap and it being a refined product unlike ender its very acceptable for me
[2024-05-26T16:44:52] haku: agreed. nozzle changes are easy too. or you can buy whole hot ends and switch faster.
[2024-05-26T16:45:08] Happy Giraffe: For mini its 10 secondsüòÅ
[2024-05-26T16:45:56] Happy Giraffe: No clogged threads on shitty alu block that leaks filament right after startup againüòÇ

[2024-05-26T16:48:26] haku: i need to learn cad. thats my summer project
[2024-05-26T16:48:48] Happy Giraffe: If you later want a short startup guide for Fusion I could propably do some skype call if you want
[2024-05-26T16:49:08] Happy Giraffe: I'm learner myself but just to get you up and running faster
[2024-05-26T16:49:10] haku: that be cool.
[2024-05-26T16:49:38] haku: thanks
[2024-05-26T16:50:14] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>

[2024-05-26T17:51:03] Lisa: When ordering normal quantities like 100-200
[2024-05-26T18:03:01] Happy Giraffe: Has someone tested the 40PL?
[2024-05-26T18:34:11] Franchesco Carofano: controller for 72 vol 84 high 200 250 ah price quality that can be sent to chile which one do you recommend
[2024-05-26T18:34:29] Rose: Hey there Jhonny, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-05-26T18:37:57] Yamal: Franchesco many time the people here talking about spintend 85/250
[2024-05-26T18:38:10] Franchesco Carofano: Escr√≠beme
[2024-05-26T18:38:13] Franchesco Carofano: En espa√±ol

[2024-05-26T18:38:17] Franchesco Carofano: Que dices
[2024-05-26T18:41:02] Rose: Hey there Jhonny, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-05-26T18:42:21] Yamal: https://a.aliexpress.com/_ExfKcFh
[2024-05-26T18:42:58] Yamal: Por privado man!
[2024-05-26T18:43:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: @Foujiwara sells better version of spintend 250
[2024-05-26T18:43:06] Franchesco Carofano: Listo papi
[2024-05-26T18:43:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Otherwise shul 350
[2024-05-26T18:44:02] Yamal: He is in Chile ‚Ä¶ better Alli
[2024-05-26T18:44:26] Franchesco Carofano: Send me a photo of Paolo, where I can get it is PSRS, a colleague who did not find a case with one of the controllers and tronic does not ship to Chile
[2024-05-26T18:44:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: C350 3Shul :)
[2024-05-26T18:47:28] Franchesco Carofano: Where do I get those controllers?
[2024-05-26T18:48:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: Rage Mechanics website
[2024-05-26T18:49:16] Yamal: @SibClimb how is the race?
[2024-05-26T18:49:37] Yamal: You don‚Äôt have stock now yes ?
[2024-05-26T18:50:42] Patrick: Where can i buy them? Except for i think it was Alibaba i found noone selling them
[2024-05-26T18:53:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: Depends, if you use express courier theres no prob, for other postal service probably yes :(
[2024-05-26T18:53:28] Franchesco Carofano: Paolo, when I mean price, it is cheaper than the tronic or more expensive, I am talking about 300 dollars for two controllers, the client has a lot of money.
[2024-05-26T19:00:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: 3.11mR
[2024-05-26T19:00:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: Molicel is going to fail :/
[2024-05-26T19:02:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don't understand, he have the money to spend or don't have the money? Because 300$ two controller is very very cheap
[2024-05-26T19:03:19] Franchesco Carofano: but the other time he said it would cost 500 for two tronics there are better things for less money that's what you hear people say about you
[2024-05-26T19:04:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I dont understand also
[2024-05-26T19:15:09] Happy Giraffe: 20s3p compact power batteriesüòÅ Imagine if those are quick swappable then you would have a very sleek build in a bicycleüòÅ
[2024-05-26T19:15:55] Franchesco Carofano: Please leave me the lick of the spintend to see it
[2024-05-26T19:16:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes but it's not even expensive
[2024-05-26T19:16:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: That's the point
[2024-05-26T19:16:20] Mirono escooters: "One thing I've noticed though is that beyond 5C, the capacity loss becomes much smaller, indicating that the hotter cell has much lower internal resistance." Oh god
[2024-05-26T19:19:09] Mirono escooters: Yeah
[2024-05-26T19:19:31] haku: 1.80 p42a üòÅ
[2024-05-26T19:19:37] Happy Giraffe: Only thing that decreases resistance when heated is fuking NTC10K thermistorüòÇ
[2024-05-26T19:20:21] haku: when these eve cells come out ill hoard em
[2024-05-26T19:20:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes but used :/

[2024-05-26T19:26:19] haku: 50e 80cents a piece if you buy 2k cells
[2024-05-26T19:26:49] Oreo huzky: <photos/photo_15188@26-05-2024_19-26-49.jpg>

[2024-05-26T19:46:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: Where
[2024-05-26T19:46:32] Lisa: 40PL they said price 4,35$ pcs
[2024-05-26T19:46:45] Lisa: For normal people who don‚Äôt buy thousands
[2024-05-26T19:48:44] haku: you should buy thousands if this cell is in demand right now. double your money

[2024-05-26T21:31:27] JPPL: Any little review about both with same setup?
[2024-05-26T21:31:29] JPPL: The feel
[2024-05-26T21:31:34] haku: for 22x3 get the new mini spintend.

[2024-05-26T21:33:36] haku: @jamessoderstrom when is the new mini spintend coming out?
[2024-05-26T21:36:00] haku: that would be perfect fit for g30 conceal carry
[2024-05-26T21:38:27] haku: all spintend got to do now is a 24fet and they are set
[2024-05-26T21:38:56] haku: for the ebike boys with qs motors
[2024-05-26T21:39:02] NetworkDir: What
[2024-05-26T21:39:12] haku: ?
[2024-05-26T21:39:47] NetworkDir: We purchase shitty used cihenese cells for 2$ in turkiye
[2024-05-26T21:39:54] NetworkDir: <animation>
[2024-05-26T21:40:49] haku: got these welded but never cycled p42a for that price. the deal was short and sold out though.
[2024-05-26T21:41:29] Yamal: I have carried the 65h 33/2 only with Kelly 7218, with the tronic as normal they do not go well, they got hot just to say that the 33/2 are very powerful, they lack a bit in output but after that they have no end of what they lengthen
[2024-05-26T21:41:34] NetworkDir: At all p42a in turkiye are 12$üò≠
[2024-05-26T21:41:53] haku: from these robot packs
[2024-05-26T21:41:53] haku: <photos/photo_15190@26-05-2024_21-41-53.jpg>
[2024-05-26T21:42:38] haku: punedir need to smuggle them in then
[2024-05-26T21:43:07] Yamal: The 60h 22/3, are very explosive in torque with a good discharge, perfect for humiliating motorcycles/cars and everything that comes your way at a traffic light, they are also more compatible with more ESCs and in general go well with 37A fw I was able to get 131kmh
[2024-05-26T21:43:09] haku: also buy from james. he might ship there
[2024-05-26T21:43:28] NetworkDir: Turkiye customs ü§ó
[2024-05-26T21:43:50] haku: crazy bro
[2024-05-26T21:44:01] NetworkDir: Any battery are forbidden
[2024-05-26T21:44:17] haku: what. thats insane
[2024-05-26T21:44:40] NetworkDir: and it's not for safety its just more $ for GOV
[2024-05-26T21:44:46] haku: atleast you get your own batteries made from your country. good for economy
[2024-05-26T21:45:22] NetworkDir: Only companies can import with high costs on customs
[2024-05-26T21:45:39] NetworkDir: Yes but just 18650/2800mAh
[2024-05-26T21:46:00] NetworkDir: Good cells but never can compare with p42
[2024-05-26T21:46:17] NetworkDir: 15 mOhm vs 4-5mOhm xD
[2024-05-26T21:47:19] haku: p42 higher than that. i test at 8-9 but reality might be more since my tester not accurate
[2024-05-26T21:50:07] haku: here comparisson vs 40t
[2024-05-26T21:50:08] haku: <photos/photo_15192@26-05-2024_21-50-08.jpg>
[2024-05-26T21:50:08] haku: <photos/photo_15193@26-05-2024_21-50-08.jpg>
[2024-05-26T21:50:58] Yamal: P42a?
[2024-05-26T21:51:10] haku: yep
[2024-05-26T21:51:42] Yamal: How many you get ?
[2024-05-26T21:52:03] haku: i collected 490 cells baby.
[2024-05-26T21:52:14] Yamal: Heheüëç
[2024-05-26T21:52:28] Yamal: For g30
[2024-05-26T21:52:38] haku: we going to build a emoto. in the future.
[2024-05-26T21:52:52] haku: yes. that too
[2024-05-26T21:53:26] haku: 16s6p like roschees build
[2024-05-26T21:53:29] Yamal: The truth is that the little I heard about one vs the other, the p42a wins in everything except resistance, the 40t heats up less
[2024-05-26T21:54:03] haku: it doesnt matter i have both to test.
[2024-05-26T21:54:40] haku: p42 more capacity
[2024-05-26T21:54:44] Yamal: but come on, if Rion mounts p42a, they are destined to be the best cells in the world :)
[2024-05-26T21:54:48] Yamal: Yes
[2024-05-26T21:55:09] haku: p45 the big dick battery as for now
[2024-05-26T21:55:32] Yamal: You buy new ?
[2024-05-26T21:55:42] Franchesco Carofano: <photos/photo_15194@26-05-2024_21-55-42.jpg>
[2024-05-26T21:56:46] haku: no. they were welded in packs but never cycled
[2024-05-26T21:57:23] haku: batteries made in may-oct last year
[2024-05-26T21:59:04] haku: this how the welds look like.
[2024-05-26T21:59:06] Yamal: You are becoming the master of the west coast, I see you opening the store right now
[2024-05-26T21:59:58] haku: nah. im not into fastest biggest dick racing. i just like to collect things
[2024-05-26T22:00:40] haku: if i want to go fast seated is safer imo
[2024-05-26T22:00:47] Yamal: I haven't said anything about racing
[2024-05-26T22:01:36] haku: its hard to ride like this all day.
[2024-05-26T22:01:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: ???
[2024-05-26T22:03:11] Franchesco Carofano: <photos/photo_15197@26-05-2024_22-03-11.jpg>
[2024-05-26T22:03:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Still help chat guys
[2024-05-26T22:09:14] Yamal: Let's see if they post anything about this weekend's races that I haven't been able to see at all.
[2024-05-26T22:09:33] haku: post the fight!
[2024-05-26T22:09:51] haku: i want to see how the french fight
[2024-05-26T22:14:54] Yamal: Well, look at these types of fights, they arouse curiosity, the how and why? but it's not important at all
[2024-05-26T22:17:26] haku: makes the sport more exciting. it means they are really passionate and will do what it takes to win. but thats just my opinion
[2024-05-26T22:18:07] haku: you see this in alot of sports. but never boring ones
[2024-05-26T22:19:27] haku: 90s basketball is an example.
[2024-05-26T22:20:21] Yamal: Doing whatever it takes to win is not professional "my opinion"
[2024-05-26T22:21:27] haku: what bro we are on the opposite spectrum. i would do whatever it takes for my team to win.
[2024-05-26T22:23:11] haku: its not sportsman like i know
[2024-05-26T22:25:40] haku: specially with sports that dont drugtest i would be roided to the gills
[2024-05-26T22:32:16] sombre_enfant: @Foujiwara bien ? Pk il ton mis peno a toi et nico ? Puis abandon ?
[2024-05-26T22:34:51] Patrick: Nice you already tryed Cell-Level fusing with high discharge Cells?
[2024-05-26T22:36:06] sombre_enfant: Who told u that ? I checked status and there was penalty then abandon
[2024-05-26T22:39:00] Face de Pin Suc√©: Too long to explain
[2024-05-26T22:40:24] sombre_enfant: Do a voice msg i do the quickn translation
[2024-05-26T22:41:06] sombre_enfant: I just want to understand the penalty and abandon idc bout the fight
[2024-05-26T22:41:32] haku: no the bms can only do 100a. i doubt it can do more with fused
[2024-05-26T22:44:17] sombre_enfant: Dont forget, he might need to gatekeep the fight ü§£üò≠
[2024-05-26T22:44:34] haku: put it on payperview ill pay
[2024-05-26T22:44:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: No he didn't
[2024-05-26T22:45:52] Patrick: Too bad, I thought you had an idea of how to install the thick fuses for such a powerful cell, it's terrible. I can't weld them with my spot welder, and the remaining ideas are all catastrophic when it comes to replacing a fuse. Probably then just sticking with it for packs with low discharge.
[2024-05-26T22:46:38] haku: this was a photo of the modules before i harvested cells.
[2024-05-26T22:47:23] Yamal: Who won today's race, does anyone know?
[2024-05-26T22:47:27] haku: its wierd why they choose 5p p42a for just 100a bms. they couldve went with higher capacity
[2024-05-26T22:48:08] haku: but im not the robot engineer who designed it
[2024-05-26T22:48:29] Patrick: Not really just hard to implement
[2024-05-26T23:06:35] Patrick: But adds saftey to the pack that isnt wrong when having such high discharges
[2024-05-26T23:09:27] haku: do you guys know what the numbers and the letters mean on a naked p42a?
[2024-05-26T23:10:10] haku: these ones
[2024-05-26T23:11:28] haku: is that a code where and when its made?
[2024-05-26T23:12:49] haku: p42a always starts witg letter L and p45 is Y right?
[2024-05-26T23:29:32] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Has someone tried the flipsky dual non vesc esc ?
[2024-05-26T23:30:02] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: https://a.aliexpress.com/_oB94Weu
[2024-05-26T23:33:41] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: But what they cloned is too expensive for me
[2024-05-26T23:34:15] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: The ubox one
[2024-05-26T23:36:07] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Not enough space for 2 75200s
[2024-05-26T23:38:31] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Will be better then one 75200?
[2024-05-26T23:39:54] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: No space for a piece of hair
[2024-05-26T23:39:59] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: <photos/photo_15199@26-05-2024_23-39-59.jpg>
[2024-05-26T23:40:24] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I don't think the ubox dual will fit in there ü§£
[2024-05-26T23:43:17] Happy Giraffe: Dont you have enough of that in your neighborhood? Or hood to say it shortüòÇ
[2024-05-26T23:44:35] Happy Giraffe: You wont have any cooling and vesc will overheat if not bolted down
[2024-05-26T23:45:12] Happy Giraffe: I would tidy up cables and then make room to mount vesc in frame
[2024-05-26T23:45:26] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: The 75200 I have currently overheated once after 20km ride
[2024-05-26T23:46:02] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: The wires are tidid up now not a lot more space there
[2024-05-26T23:47:03] Happy Giraffe: Propably could fit two 80/150 or whatever the alu single is called and then mount those to a T shaped alu sheet
[2024-05-26T23:47:45] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_15200@26-05-2024_23-47-45.jpg>
[2024-05-26T23:50:00] Happy Giraffe: C shape alu plate possible too and one vesc upside downüòÅ
[2024-05-26T23:51:46] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_15201@26-05-2024_23-51-46.jpg>
[2024-05-26T23:52:14] Happy Giraffe: That single ubox so small it would fit
[2024-05-26T23:59:20] Yamal: And thinking about the spintend, it can't be a problem if you carry it outside because of the pins that it has on it...?
[2024-05-27T00:07:39] Happy Giraffe: Direct air works if vesc designed that way
[2024-05-27T00:09:21] haku: someone needs to test out the mini spintend
[2024-05-27T00:10:33] haku: it seems like its really good
[2024-05-27T00:14:42] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: What do u say about this one ? https://www.makerx-tech.com/products/go-foc-d100s
[2024-05-27T00:20:21] JPPL: Thankd

[2024-05-27T00:24:45] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_15203@27-05-2024_00-24-45.jpg>
[2024-05-27T00:25:05] NetworkDir: i fit like that.. but your battery very big 20s5p inside + ubox 80100 without extender done
[2024-05-27T00:25:17] NetworkDir: of course without holders but isolation 10/10
[2024-05-27T00:25:59] Noname: Yeah I asked for a sample
[2024-05-27T00:26:20] Noname: Buy 2 get one free?
[2024-05-27T00:26:28] haku: not a sample lol. like real world test
[2024-05-27T00:26:50] Noname: Well I can't buy it. Not a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of.
[2024-05-27T00:26:53] haku: its not even in the website
[2024-05-27T00:27:02] Noname: Yeah so test sample
[2024-05-27T00:27:24] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Are they bigger than the 84100 of makerbase?
[2024-05-27T00:27:32] NetworkDir: no
[2024-05-27T00:27:42] NetworkDir: size same with 75100 alupcb
[2024-05-27T00:27:54] NetworkDir: also smaller i think
[2024-05-27T00:28:31] haku: how about dual spintend?
[2024-05-27T00:28:49] haku: size would fit perfectly i think
[2024-05-27T00:29:05] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Don't ship to me
[2024-05-27T00:29:31] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: This are the 84100hp
[2024-05-27T00:29:38] NetworkDir: i hear about have a overheat issue
[2024-05-27T00:29:43] haku: what thats crazy. theres some vendors here that have it
[2024-05-27T00:29:57] NetworkDir: Ubox 80V 150A: Size: 102*57*21mm
[2024-05-27T00:29:59] haku: it gets hot yes.
[2024-05-27T00:30:17] haku: but its small
[2024-05-27T00:30:37] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: But expensiveier
[2024-05-27T00:31:03] NetworkDir: but more reliable :)
[2024-05-27T00:31:10] NetworkDir: at least don't burn like mks
[2024-05-27T00:31:28] NetworkDir: <video_file>
[2024-05-27T00:31:28] NetworkDir: Esc: burns randomly without even pressing gas ALLLAAAAAH ALLLAHU AKBAR ALLLAAAAH
[2024-05-27T00:32:51] haku: smart of punedir to disconect the batteries
[2024-05-27T00:32:54] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: You need to thank Allah that this didn't happened In the middle of the highway aaha
[2024-05-27T00:33:32] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Happened me once when vesc got to 85¬∞
[2024-05-27T00:33:49] NetworkDir: i use uboxs like 500km just i have thorttle problem. looks noise from cables or my 5V components gone after phase + hall shorts
[2024-05-27T00:34:37] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: 2 80/100 ubox are 300$
[2024-05-27T00:35:32] haku: wait for a sale. i got mine for 90ea
[2024-05-27T00:35:57] NetworkDir: 11kW (5500W - 5500W) Dual - 72V 42 deg :) (outside temp something like 20)
[2024-05-27T00:36:37] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: <photos/photo_15206@27-05-2024_00-36-37.jpg>
[2024-05-27T00:36:45] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Half for 2
[2024-05-27T00:37:17] haku: you are pretty much gambling or you really know what you are doing if you get these.
[2024-05-27T00:37:51] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Are they worse then the 75100 of flipsky?
[2024-05-27T00:38:41] haku: no idea. but spintend seem to be the trusted brand here. only folks who really know how to tune get those flipsky
[2024-05-27T00:39:09] NetworkDir: fets, pcb quality, design looks better from 75100 but on group we see 2-3 burned itself. reason = unknown (maybe fake chips..)
[2024-05-27T00:39:52] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: The 84100hp are not an option then
[2024-05-27T00:40:23] haku: flipsky is like the poor mans tronic 250 from what ive read. both shit products
[2024-05-27T00:41:31] haku: tbh i only have experience with dual 100/100 spintend so im talking out of my ass
[2024-05-27T00:42:10] haku: its not bad if bolted and thermal pasted
[2024-05-27T00:43:03] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: The red one ?
[2024-05-27T00:43:24] haku: the black one is what i used.
[2024-05-27T00:43:29] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I have one at home already so it'll be cheaper
[2024-05-27T00:44:01] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I heard it had some over voltage issue or somt
[2024-05-27T00:44:29] haku: yes. but i only ran it at 68v
[2024-05-27T00:44:35] haku: 16s
[2024-05-27T00:44:56] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Also they pulled it down from store
[2024-05-27T00:45:08] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: People are angy
[2024-05-27T00:45:26] haku: they prolly phasing it out and make a new alu version
[2024-05-27T00:45:51] haku: it wasnt the greatest but it worked.
[2024-05-27T00:47:05] haku: you are right. its not in the store anymore. maybe shit product lol
[2024-05-27T00:47:10] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: What is the difference?
[2024-05-27T00:47:46] haku: no idea. sorry
[2024-05-27T00:48:34] Yamal: Haku !!! üòÇ
[2024-05-27T00:49:57] haku: the new tronics! next level
[2024-05-27T00:50:09] haku: rich mans vesc
[2024-05-27T00:50:26] Yamal: these are made by the grinch
[2024-05-27T00:51:25] Yamal: very expensive
[2024-05-27T00:51:35] Happy Giraffe: https://spintend.com/products/single-ubox-aluminum-controller-80v-100a-based-on-vesc?variant=42515763953816
[2024-05-27T00:51:38] Happy Giraffe: 2x these
[2024-05-27T00:52:39] Happy Giraffe: and bolt them down to frame or alu sheet
[2024-05-27T00:52:44] haku: the new mini one is cool too
[2024-05-27T00:53:04] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: They don't ship to me
[2024-05-27T00:53:30] Yamal: Also in Alli there are ..
[2024-05-27T00:53:37] haku: there are EU vendors here buddy
[2024-05-27T00:56:20] Yamal: The 85/250 are in the spotlight, we will see what happens in the following months...
[2024-05-27T00:56:33] haku: its a big boy
[2024-05-27T00:57:34] Happy Giraffe: James sells
[2024-05-27T00:57:50] Yamal: With the battery I have, that's what I'm looking for, "power"
[2024-05-27T00:58:43] haku: unlimited poweeer!!
[2024-05-27T01:00:02] haku: where you gonna bolt it. its pretty big
[2024-05-27T01:00:33] NetworkDir: Best and easy way Put thermal paste + use some crap heat sink for screw And you just put 1 screw :D
[2024-05-27T01:00:33] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_15212@27-05-2024_01-00-33.jpg>
[2024-05-27T01:02:19] haku: it needs a big surface area.
[2024-05-27T01:02:29] haku: pretty much double the 6fet
[2024-05-27T01:03:17] Yamal: I'm going to hang them from my ears! but it's still not sure, maybe I'll try one more time with the little, I mean I have several options: - try a little with the new heatsink and take the same pair, take the spintends or go all out and save for the x12
[2024-05-27T01:03:55] Yamal: Niceüëç
[2024-05-27T01:04:37] Yamal: You need to try them, in the photo they are top notch
[2024-05-27T01:04:38] haku: i know the new spintend mini will be a bamger for scooters
[2024-05-27T01:05:01] haku: not even interested in scooters anymore tbh
[2024-05-27T01:05:15] haku: the fire died
[2024-05-27T01:05:59] Yamal: But let's see how much you can set the phase amps and what are their peaks?
[2024-05-27T01:06:56] Yamal: E-bike 100x100?
[2024-05-27T01:07:03] haku: the talaria mommy opened my eyes.

[2024-05-27T01:07:51] Yamal: It makes me angry that you haven't even tried it, you wanted to burn the tires and make a donut
[2024-05-27T01:08:22] haku: gathering dust üò≠
[2024-05-27T01:09:18] haku: for the boys i will do my best!

[2024-05-27T01:10:10] Yamal: You still have to destroy Voro Motors in a race.
[2024-05-27T01:10:45] Yamal: but don't fight, you don't have equipment,,, we are on the other side of the pond
[2024-05-27T01:11:23] haku: i can always make fun of the onewheel guy atleast
[2024-05-27T01:12:06] Yamal: You are loaded with material to the teeth, cells, esc, motors, and I with a little every day up and down
[2024-05-27T01:13:18] haku: im a hoarder
[2024-05-27T01:14:18] Yamal: You need to put the cloth headband on your head, paint two black stripes on each side of your face and then start going up and down Rambo-type stairs
[2024-05-27T01:14:58] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Do you know what will really help me if someone has dimensions of the zero10x battery compartment (belly)
[2024-05-27T01:16:01] Noname: @Bradhaku what's the specks on your unwanted scooter motor samples

[2024-05-27T01:19:09] Yamal: Well, I'm sure they are resting, tomorrow when they read you they will respond!
[2024-05-27T01:19:26] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: 123 x 32 x 50 with nothing in

[2024-05-27T01:24:39] Yamal: Be careful what is said about vesc in the group that Benjamin is reading I mean, if you talk about "trampa" it's better to take your hat off.
[2024-05-27T01:25:06] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: U twerking to me ?
[2024-05-27T01:25:44] Yamal: General üé©

[2024-05-27T02:09:39] Noname: I saw a production one. It was like a gotrax scooter with a shopping cart caster wheel on front. No thank you
[2024-05-27T02:30:02] Noname: @jackbeldig Do you have a Bluetooth module
[2024-05-27T06:45:41] Yamal: Spintend!
[2024-05-27T06:53:06] Yamal: How was the weekend on the scooter route? You still haven't posted a photo of your vsett 11
[2024-05-27T06:53:54] Noname: 125 miles my buddy was out late and we started late so it was a rush lol
[2024-05-27T06:54:10] Noname: The park road
[2024-05-27T06:54:44] Noname: Made it to destination after pleading with park rangers to let us in
[2024-05-27T06:55:48] Noname: Then did about 70 miles today to the beach but it was foggy and cold
[2024-05-27T06:56:17] Yamal: Total route 125 miles ?
[2024-05-27T06:56:38] Noname: Lock bridge. Favorite thing is to find one with the numbers on back and unlock it
[2024-05-27T06:56:38] Noname: <photos/photo_15219@27-05-2024_06-56-38.jpg>
[2024-05-27T06:57:39] Noname: Took us 12 hours üòÜ
[2024-05-27T06:58:25] Yamal: Well, you have been rather slow, right? 125 miles (200 km) isn't too much for a week, but it's great! Beautiful views, nature and tranquility!
[2024-05-27T06:59:15] Noname: 200 miles in 2 days
[2024-05-27T06:59:24] Noname: 320km
[2024-05-27T06:59:39] Yamal: Nice

[2024-05-27T07:00:13] Yamal: Don't you ride the scooter during the week?
[2024-05-27T07:00:18] Noname: No
[2024-05-27T07:00:33] Noname: Mabey on my street for a few minutes

[2024-05-27T07:01:47] Noname: On my ebike though
[2024-05-27T07:01:48] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Noname has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-05-27T07:02:10] Yamal: ? almost retired? Pass a photo of the vsett, the best thing of all is seeing the scooters, by the way, do you have a vesc in it?
[2024-05-27T07:05:07] Noname: This is a park down the street from me. I sneak in the back way and look for mushrooms for my friend. Idk not a picture guy
[2024-05-27T07:05:32] Noname: I'm 44 but stand on concrete all day. I can only take so much

[2024-05-27T07:06:37] Noname: I have the 85/250's with stock and a 16s6p Sanyo
[2024-05-27T07:07:14] Yamal: just seeing the scooters is enough
[2024-05-27T07:07:21] Noname: Been thinking sneak into a nature preserve etc and camp for the night.
[2024-05-27T07:08:00] Noname: Yeah free living till you got arrested
[2024-05-27T07:08:02] Yamal: I'm 33, but as if I were 60, I'm looking forward to retiring and living life.üòÇüí•
[2024-05-27T07:08:03] haku: ide build a shack there and live off the land
[2024-05-27T07:08:40] haku: if i did not have kid ide prolly do that.
[2024-05-27T07:08:56] Noname: Ah small town with portions of woods. Need to go more north into the woods of Maine or canada
[2024-05-27T07:09:27] Noname: You'd freeze to death in the winter though
[2024-05-27T07:10:11] haku: i would use bear, wolf and racoon skin to keep me warm
[2024-05-27T07:10:26] Yamal: Are you really with the 85/250?
[2024-05-27T07:11:07] haku: i also have a snow dog to attack animals on command
[2024-05-27T07:12:17] Noname: Yeah
[2024-05-27T07:13:01] Noname: <photos/photo_15223@27-05-2024_07-13-01.jpg>
[2024-05-27T07:13:11] Yamal: I have had dogs all my life now only 5 cats: -Olive -weped -Slack -Rion -Nami
[2024-05-27T07:13:39] Noname: You old lady 5 cats?
[2024-05-27T07:14:25] Yamal: They look pretty!! What power do they generate with 60v? Let's see if you do a speed test or something and record vesc tool so we can see the clocks move!!üòÅ
[2024-05-27T07:14:50] haku: he a range man üòÅ
[2024-05-27T07:15:04] Noname: Anyone ever notice a like clunk feeling when starting off. It's like a contactor switch
[2024-05-27T07:15:32] Noname: 10800watts and 54mph
[2024-05-27T07:16:57] Yamal: excellent!‚ö°Ô∏è
[2024-05-27T07:19:02] Noname: Idk it works I just ride phone in pocket just check voltage here and there when we stop. Gonna put a V display on and that's all I need. Don't even care about speed I can guess üòÇ
[2024-05-27T07:20:08] Yamal: I love watching vesc tool when the scooter is hitting hard
[2024-05-27T07:20:30] Noname: I spend all my time planning routes. 6hrs planning for a 12hr ride.
[2024-05-27T07:20:41] Noname: Distractions
[2024-05-27T07:21:27] Yamal: No... I only do screen recordings, of course... I don't look at my phone.
[2024-05-27T07:23:01] Noname: Green is cool roads Red is charging Blue want to go I just connect dots make a route but Gmaps sucks to plan with. I want the worst route not the most efficient.
[2024-05-27T07:23:04] Yamal: Here we also usually do long routes, the maximum that I remember is approximately 160 km in a day...
[2024-05-27T07:23:43] Noname: 96mi. 90 was about my max last year
[2024-05-27T07:23:51] haku: do the first coast to coast scooter ride
[2024-05-27T07:23:56] Noname: <animation>
[2024-05-27T07:24:14] Yamal: Now I'm waiting to pin the 2 controller to start putting in the miles with the good weather!
[2024-05-27T07:24:21] Noname: You pay my mortgage I will leave now
[2024-05-27T07:24:46] Noname: I got 23$ in my wallet
[2024-05-27T07:24:52] haku: you would get sponsors to pay you bro. im sure
[2024-05-27T07:25:11] Noname: Then pay for knee replacement?
[2024-05-27T07:26:04] Noname: üòÜ I have sat down on my feet knees on deck. It's a bit sketch
[2024-05-27T07:26:54] haku: thats the thing about scooters. after working out legs i feel like im twerking the whole ride
[2024-05-27T07:27:31] haku: my legs shake
[2024-05-27T07:28:22] haku: and thats only going to the wendys in the corner
[2024-05-27T07:30:30] Noname: Sorry but im never riding with the twerking china scooter man. That's just to much

[2024-05-27T10:25:27] Yamal: Is there a prize for winning the championships or some simple Pmt..?

[2024-05-27T10:30:14] haku: the only shit they get is surrendering to the germans. thats an americans point of view
[2024-05-27T10:32:02] haku: but back to scooters. only folks in the world that has these kinda sports
[2024-05-27T10:33:06] Yamal: You have to find the videos from last weekend, in them is the key to this championship
[2024-05-27T10:34:12] haku: i want to see the fight. im sure someone recorded it. i dont even know where to find these race videos

[2024-05-27T13:03:59] Yamal: And how did the scooter look after the fall?
[2024-05-27T13:06:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: Only esthetic is damaged
[2024-05-27T13:14:09] Yamal: The red one ?
[2024-05-27T13:28:52] Yamal: Katana one ?

[2024-05-27T14:32:17] Yamal: Nice ! Island
[2024-05-27T14:33:50] Yamal: Enjoy‚ö°Ô∏è
[2024-05-27T14:43:16] Andrius: What vesc that other nami is running?
[2024-05-27T14:48:11] Face de Pin Suc√©: Katana is not part of Rage Mechanics since last year
[2024-05-27T14:49:27] Yamal: üì∏
[2024-05-27T14:51:03] Andrius: Since this is offtopic channel, and suppose you are someone from rage, is it worth to travel to france for a race?
[2024-05-27T15:01:21] Andrius: What budget vesc to buy? 20s 140a bat max
[2024-05-27T15:06:31] Happy Giraffe: Alu ubox 6fet 85/150
[2024-05-27T15:07:08] Happy Giraffe: If you need 140A batt current for one esc then 85/250
[2024-05-27T15:08:50] Happy Giraffe: Would need some custom cooling solution lol
[2024-05-27T15:13:45] Andrius: Nah it would be used as dual motor config, bat has low discharge just 140a, so it would be 70a per side
[2024-05-27T15:14:24] Andrius: So this one would be alright for dual setup? Just connect both esc through can?
[2024-05-27T15:14:35] Yamal: In France there are the Akira Nakai of scooters,,,, worth !
[2024-05-27T15:24:23] Andrius: I know, just wondering should I travel half europe to attend
[2024-05-27T15:27:04] Franchesco Carofano: one has only bigger motors with original controllers extra varia and mine tronic 250
[2024-05-27T15:31:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes it is üòé
[2024-05-27T15:31:47] Face de Pin Suc√©: Where do you come from ? What scooter do you have ?
[2024-05-27T15:33:42] Andrius: Lithuania, as right now nami burn
[2024-05-27T15:34:44] Andrius: By any chance maybe you still have original B controller and willing to sell?
[2024-05-27T15:36:27] NetworkDir: <video_file>
[2024-05-27T15:37:45] Happy Giraffe: Yes, it would do fantastic on 5kw per esc
[2024-05-27T15:39:40] Happy Giraffe: Just need to bolt it down to aluminium frame with thermal paste, its mounting screws are retarded M2.5 and placed under vesc so would recommend something like a 3-5mm thick alu plate (to tranafer the heat) thats also mounted to scooter frame via thermal paste and bolts
[2024-05-27T15:45:16] Face de Pin Suc√©: You can come and have fun
[2024-05-27T15:53:34] Franchesco Carofano: I have the pair of controllers but I already sold them friend and I'm in Chile. I have a friend who downloaded them and was going to sell them. I sold mine for 200 Chileans, which is about 200 euros per pair of course.
[2024-05-27T16:08:05] Andrius: Maybe copper plate would be better choice than alu?
[2024-05-27T16:17:16] Mirono escooters: Not really
[2024-05-27T16:17:24] Mirono escooters: Don't mount copper to alu too
[2024-05-27T16:18:10] Mirono escooters: @jamessoderstrom
[2024-05-27T16:18:44] Happy Giraffe: Alu conducts heat well
[2024-05-27T16:19:25] Happy Giraffe: Paste between should stop electro corrosion. But I doubt it even is a big issue if surfaces are clean and dont get water on them
[2024-05-27T16:43:08] Mirono escooters: Im still not a fan
[2024-05-27T16:43:23] Mirono escooters: Aluminum heat conductivitu is already so high you are limited by other stuff

[2024-05-27T22:54:22] Yamal: I mean that your vescs stand out from the rest, they are not the usual esc that everyone rides and that makes you original

[2024-05-27T23:42:31] haku: looks like custom frame mini moto
[2024-05-27T23:47:39] Yamal: What I mean is that with that esc you can have peaks of 600/800 A of phase, if it has to be programmed not to exceed 400/450A for safety it is not worth going to something so big, because even though it always The esc would be more than enough or relax, it would not be possible to get all the benefit it can deliver..
[2024-05-27T23:50:15] Yamal: <photos/photo_15265@27-05-2024_23-50-15.jpg>
[2024-05-28T00:03:33] Yamal: in the programming of it" in A Phase motor, would 250 A really be the maximum programmable, finding those peaks so high, or do people directly give them more amperes in the programming?

[2024-05-28T10:04:07] Yamal: Your e-scooter
[2024-05-28T10:14:13] Rose: Hey there Rogelio, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-05-28T10:20:03] Thierry: I have two G30 and the last scooter was for French championship, based on vcitor frame but unfortunately I only took part of first race. I had a climbing accident just before second weekend of race. I'm out for several month.
[2024-05-28T10:32:50] cihan: This one for example. It's 4p at most. If it was available as 5p or 6p I could have a single nickel plate for whole battery. Do you buy flat nickel strip and then cut and make slots on it?
[2024-05-28T10:39:47] Ohad Avishay Shatz: hello, onewheel plus footpad pinout for connecting vesc , anyone have it?
[2024-05-28T11:25:52] Yamal: get better machine!
[2024-05-28T11:27:22] haku: yes. you can get nickle sheets roll too and cut to any shape.
[2024-05-28T11:30:31] Thierry: I'm happy with my g30, one mono and one awd. Big scooter are more risky, don't know where you're from but in Switzerland if the police arrest you. They take the scooter. Bye-bye your money
[2024-05-28T11:34:43] haku: how big of battery are you making to need 4+ rows?
[2024-05-28T11:36:36] Yamal: Spain
[2024-05-28T11:43:23] Yamal: You have to adapt to the place like chameleons! or as Bruce Lee said: "be water my friend"
[2024-05-28T12:05:06] Jan: Its everywhere like this.
[2024-05-28T12:24:34] Yamal: Phase of course
[2024-05-28T12:29:12] Yamal: 2 ESC
[2024-05-28T12:29:24] Yamal: ? Like 200A 1
[2024-05-28T13:11:01] Thierry: 400A phase on 6 fets vesc?
[2024-05-28T13:16:11] BBC: Lmao
[2024-05-28T13:16:21] BBC: Even toll struggle with 150-200
[2024-05-28T13:24:05] cihan: It can be 20s5p or 20s6p with a low chance, I'm near limits of inner width of the deck with 6p,i need to try with some batteries since there are screw holes inside deck. The small gaps between cells on sides of the battery need to leave space for these screw holes.
[2024-05-28T13:24:23] Thierry: @jamaludin_algarnati
[2024-05-28T14:03:19] Yamal: üëç
[2024-05-28T14:48:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: @Foujiwara tested , even with 12 fet it doesn't handle the current
[2024-05-28T14:59:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: U can try 400a on 6fet
[2024-05-28T14:59:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Immediately fire
[2024-05-28T15:03:06] haku: just do a regular 20s5p rectangle battery. is it for a scooter?
[2024-05-28T15:11:04] GABE: G30 arrived üëÄ
[2024-05-28T15:11:08] Jacob: Damn 400a, who's building an f1 car?
[2024-05-28T15:12:40] haku: e moto with 1k battery amps
[2024-05-28T15:14:42] Jacob: Damn sounds hella fun
[2024-05-28T15:14:49] Jacob: How fast will it be?
[2024-05-28T15:15:05] GABE: Fast as you want
[2024-05-28T15:15:07] GABE: lol
[2024-05-28T15:15:14] haku: no idea. its just an idea for now
[2024-05-28T15:19:30] Jacob: Lol makes my setup feel like kids toy üòÜ send us a vid if you make it
[2024-05-28T15:20:14] haku: dream for now. but theres a few here in murika that has that setup

[2024-05-28T15:56:24] Franchesco Carofano: Which of the two do you recommend?
[2024-05-28T16:07:03] Franchesco Carofano: which
[2024-05-28T16:25:00] Yamal: Very cool explanation. It would be good to know the same thing but in Battery Amps.
[2024-05-28T16:27:47] Jan: That would be a nice pinned message
[2024-05-28T16:29:04] Jan: What scooter
[2024-05-28T16:47:36] Rose: Hey there josef, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-05-28T16:55:35] josef: Hello, so recently got an ridstar q20 and well it's to slow for my liking, it's a 48v system which Ill keep for now, I'm looking for a new controller. In the future I'm looking to run 2000-3000w might upgrade to 60v but probably not, but having the ability to doesn't hurt. I really just wonder what controller would suite me best? Want Bluetooth, regen and be able to use horn, brake lights and lights which I guess the adc board is for. Any recommendations? I'll probably need some help with wiring when the stuff arrives but I'll try to learn by myself.
[2024-05-28T17:32:56] haku: how about dual 6fet spintends?
[2024-05-28T17:34:39] haku: get a vesc. wait for the mini spintend yet to be released
[2024-05-28T17:37:11] JPPL: <photos/photo_15279@28-05-2024_17-37-11.jpg>

[2024-05-28T17:38:44] josef: Yea i have to wait a month before ordering anyways but, have any info on that controller? Didn't find much on Google
[2024-05-28T17:39:48] JPPL: <video_file>
[2024-05-28T17:47:49] JPPL: <video_file>
[2024-05-28T17:48:04] JPPL: So funny
[2024-05-28T17:50:07] sombre_enfant: Design the solid clamp instead
[2024-05-28T17:51:33] haku: not much info tbh. or you can get any vesc. spintend would be the best choice
[2024-05-28T17:56:15] Finn: No
[2024-05-28T17:58:52] JPPL: <video_file>
[2024-05-28T18:01:45] josef: Will this do? https://spintend.com/collections/esc-based-on-vesc/products/single-ubox-aluminum-controller-80v-100a-based-on-vesc
[2024-05-28T18:02:12] haku: yes
[2024-05-28T18:02:40] haku: are you in EU?
[2024-05-28T18:02:52] josef: I'm in eu
[2024-05-28T18:03:24] haku: james sells these
[2024-05-28T18:05:32] josef: Does he have a website
[2024-05-28T18:09:01] sombre_enfant: No you contact him in private and pay trough paypal u can go forwoard he ship fast
[2024-05-28T18:09:08] sombre_enfant: Why ?

[2024-05-28T19:24:32] Finn: I dont need it
[2024-05-28T20:01:44] Yamal: https://youtu.be/A_OV0sXtbrY?si=ZJ02lcPzCpSpORdZ
[2024-05-28T20:17:07] cihan: Ahh, I'm sorry, I just didn't think well about how cells will connect. The battery will look like this so 2p will be all I'll need. The previous photo looks strange, positives and negatives of 4 cells are connected on that photo.
[2024-05-28T20:18:10] JPPL: Amazing
[2024-05-28T20:22:57] JPPL: Will do some soon, I promise, btw this maker d100s is running 50/60 amps battery 200a phase with absolut 350 Each side, max temperature was 75¬∞ running medium hard, ambience temp 25¬∞
[2024-05-28T20:23:20] JPPL: FW, mtpa, v0/v7 and high sample all off and now will test with all on, 85km/h is nice in the city but overtake can be faster
[2024-05-28T20:25:48] JPPL: 16s
[2024-05-28T20:26:20] Yamal: Why you have seat ?
[2024-05-28T20:31:39] JPPL: Because I never tried, only my costum bike, so I decided to make one with seat üò≠
[2024-05-28T20:33:33] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Top speed?
[2024-05-28T20:53:40] JPPL: 85 +- 90
[2024-05-28T20:58:32] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: So it's a really good vesc
[2024-05-28T20:59:10] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: But it's not enough for me to upgrade because I think I'm doing 85 already
[2024-05-28T21:02:56] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: At least I think I'm doing

[2024-05-28T21:50:59] haku: just a heads up. before you start making a battery make sure you do your research on how to connect series and parallel. also what materials are needed. just ask if you have questions.
[2024-05-28T21:53:41] haku: because its cool
[2024-05-28T21:54:12] haku: lets make seats great again fellas
[2024-05-28T22:02:28] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: battery Amp d√©pend more of the power track and capacitors, if that is perfect sized it's same current than phase
[2024-05-28T22:04:25] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: not Penalty, it's accident and not finish the race
[2024-05-28T22:10:39] Yamal: If you have to name a powerful esc this 2024, what would it be? I ask you because you are a competitor and you are surrounded by competitors,,,
[2024-05-28T22:12:00] Yamal: and I mean that it is powerful and balanced so to speak..
[2024-05-28T22:31:33] cihan: By the way what are those 3p and 4p honeycomb strips are for? If you have 4rows parallel utilizing 4p strip, then lots of current will have to pass to the next series cell group over one 4p strip line and won't it be a lot of current since thickness of 4p strip is same everywhere?
[2024-05-28T22:32:53] haku: its for unconvensional layouts
[2024-05-28T22:33:41] haku: <photos/photo_15281@28-05-2024_22-33-41.jpg>
[2024-05-28T22:34:14] haku: not mine but for something like this
[2024-05-28T22:39:00] sombre_enfant: Trippin ahh layout
[2024-05-28T22:40:06] haku: the trippy ones are the quadriple folded ones
[2024-05-28T22:40:49] haku: i have saved some of those photos in my battery porn album
[2024-05-28T22:41:17] sombre_enfant: It would be r350 ofc
[2024-05-28T22:41:39] sombre_enfant: No this layout is trippin
[2024-05-28T22:41:39] JPPL: Zesc500
[2024-05-28T22:42:05] Yamal: üßêüí•
[2024-05-28T22:43:11] haku: i think so he doesnt use super long bms connections
[2024-05-28T22:43:21] haku: im not the artist so idk
[2024-05-28T22:44:53] Yamal: <photos/photo_15282@28-05-2024_22-44-53.jpg>
[2024-05-28T22:45:18] cihan: What's the benefit of this layout?
[2024-05-28T22:46:08] haku: no clue why. but my guess is limited space
[2024-05-28T22:47:37] haku: maybe some of the folks here know.
[2024-05-28T22:48:05] Yamal: <photos/photo_15283@28-05-2024_22-48-05.jpg>
[2024-05-28T22:50:06] Yamal: Big for g30
[2024-05-28T22:51:52] haku: new mini spintend is the goat
[2024-05-28T22:53:43] JPPL: G300 rocks that r350
[2024-05-28T22:53:56] JPPL: Similar but 600a peak for exemple
[2024-05-28T22:53:58] Yamal: have you bought it?
[2024-05-28T22:54:38] Yamal: Did they say before that they don't cool well?
[2024-05-28T22:55:16] JPPL: James said, I never did track with it, only normal rides and speed tests
[2024-05-28T22:55:22] JPPL: Never hot
[2024-05-28T22:57:09] haku: no
[2024-05-28T22:59:14] Yamal: It is good to share experiences with the different esc, because we all advance very quickly together!
[2024-05-28T23:01:55] Yamal: You have to contact dualtron and tell them to stop messing around and mount 85/150
[2024-05-28T23:04:33] Yamal: put on a tie before talking to them..üòÅ
[2024-05-28T23:06:53] haku: maybe a dress. buisness casual attire for women
[2024-05-28T23:07:38] haku: they will think i really know what im talking about
[2024-05-28T23:09:01] JPPL: Can you tell us more about heat issues on g300
[2024-05-28T23:21:49] Yamal: No many ESC with 18fet..?

[2024-05-29T00:05:47] Yamal: A the battery 85/250?

[2024-05-29T00:33:14] NetworkDir: looks 2x 3x video xD
[2024-05-29T00:33:33] NetworkDir: but time fine
[2024-05-29T00:33:42] NetworkDir: 71C temp crazy
[2024-05-29T00:39:46] NetworkDir: Likely P42A (4200mAh) - 16s10p - 42Ah
[2024-05-29T00:40:16] NetworkDir: 50A field weakening :/
[2024-05-29T00:40:16] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. NetworkDir has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-05-29T00:40:24] haku: the sag is nuts if thats p42
[2024-05-29T00:40:53] JPPL: Fw on
[2024-05-29T00:41:55] JPPL: I will do today around 30a fw to see if 100 is possible
[2024-05-29T00:42:28] JPPL: My battery is from blade gt2
[2024-05-29T00:42:31] haku: what is pro motor?
[2024-05-29T00:57:00] JPPL: Not vesc but nice setups
[2024-05-29T01:32:50] haku: @jamessoderstrom isnthere anything different between the spintend 12fet 85/200 and 85/250? did they change anything aside from the name?
[2024-05-29T01:33:16] haku: bigger cables better mosfets maybe?
[2024-05-29T01:56:45] Jhonny Nu√±ez: Consult the ubox 150A, when they turn off because the BMS are blocked, do the motors brake? or does it like the tronic, the engines keep running
[2024-05-29T02:03:18] Jhonny Nu√±ez: Consult the ubox 150A, when they turn off because the BMS are blocked, do the motors brake? or does it like the tronic, the engines keep running
[2024-05-29T02:17:35] Jhonny Nu√±ez: Spintend
[2024-05-29T02:17:46] Jhonny Nu√±ez: Spintend
[2024-05-29T02:47:14] GABE: Had a 13s shutdown with my spintend 80100 and the motor didnt stop working. I could pedal home.
[2024-05-29T03:11:57] JPPL: Normally keep running, all times I burn my vescs, maybe short phases but not full brake
[2024-05-29T03:20:18] Jhonny Nu√±ez: What happens is that the MK72500, when you turn off the controller, the motors brake suddenly and regenerate and burn the controller and if the accelerator breaks the controller accelerates fully, that's why the question is if this happens with the spintends
[2024-05-29T03:26:01] Jhonny Nu√±ez: I ask these questions because that doesn't happen with the tronic
[2024-05-29T03:30:48] Jhonny Nu√±ez: because I want to buy the ubox 85V 150A spintend, but I don't know if it will do the same thing, accelerate and if the controller is turned off it will brake
[2024-05-29T03:33:34] Jhonny Nu√±ez: What we tried with the tronic, that when we release the accelerator it does nothing, otherwise it happened to us with the 72500 it accelerated and also the tronic when it turned off with the engines running it does not brake, it continues until it stops, but the 72500 does. You turn them off with the engines running, it stops suddenly.
[2024-05-29T03:34:01] Jhonny Nu√±ez: So that's what I want to know, if the ubox does the same as the 72500
[2024-05-29T03:34:25] JPPL: No it don't
[2024-05-29T03:34:36] Jhonny Nu√±ez: We already burned a 72500 en route, that happened
[2024-05-29T03:34:43] JPPL: It's ok ;)
[2024-05-29T03:36:14] Jhonny Nu√±ez: So with the spintends that doesn't happen, the controller turns off and the motors continue spinning
[2024-05-29T03:51:20] haku: my 85/200 already has dual 10awg. maybe wrong cover?
[2024-05-29T03:52:45] haku: talking about phase wires right?
[2024-05-29T03:53:30] Jhonny Nu√±ez: I have a 150A BMS, so I plan to put each one at 75A, which is how we configure the tronic
[2024-05-29T04:02:00] haku: we riding safe today boys.
[2024-05-29T04:04:48] haku: hands free baby
[2024-05-29T04:23:23] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: I didn't imagine about factory electric BMX are existüòÇüíÄüôÉ
[2024-05-29T04:24:33] haku: i change the handlebars.
[2024-05-29T04:25:10] haku: a bmx ebike would be cool diy
[2024-05-29T04:29:57] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Maybe
[2024-05-29T04:30:07] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Still thinking about that
[2024-05-29T04:30:12] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: But no money xd
[2024-05-29T04:37:09] haku: same.
[2024-05-29T04:46:34] JPPL: Little wooble at 80+ but tyres are low air :( just added fw 25+30, overall it seems better riding, I live riding at night

[2024-05-29T05:00:13] Noname: You seen the zooz bikes
[2024-05-29T05:01:02] Noname: I want to build one of these
[2024-05-29T05:03:27] haku: yes. chimerabmx is a real bmx bike with midrive
[2024-05-29T05:05:52] Noname: Yeah 3k for a bmx, not
[2024-05-29T05:05:53] haku: <photos/photo_15293@29-05-2024_05-05-53.jpg>
[2024-05-29T05:06:09] Noname: Build a 2wd
[2024-05-29T05:06:23] Noname: You have enough batterys
[2024-05-29T05:07:11] haku: the thing about bmx is the frame can only fit a few.
[2024-05-29T05:08:04] haku: you want it agile too. pop wheelies and jump ramps
[2024-05-29T05:10:47] haku: i making my son one with a g30 motor
[2024-05-29T05:16:07] Noname: Need vintage 80's frame isn't as flat
[2024-05-29T05:17:13] haku: true. but you pay for collectors item
[2024-05-29T05:17:41] Noname: At a yard sale. You live in the worst place for everything
[2024-05-29T05:19:16] Noname: <photos/photo_15294@29-05-2024_05-19-16.jpg>
[2024-05-29T05:21:17] haku: thats nice! wonder if you can convert it to disc brakes. maybe stretch the dropouts a bit
[2024-05-29T05:22:23] Noname: Regen brakes. Idk what the frame is made of
[2024-05-29T05:43:00] haku: its prolly stainless.
[2024-05-29T06:20:15] Noname: Chrome plate stainless? You funny
[2024-05-29T06:58:10] Yamal: https://youtu.be/BeOLuGC1P3o?si=CJ64mxoqOzyIHeaE
[2024-05-29T06:58:24] Yamal: If you don't have time to go to the gym, you know what to do!!! üòÇ
[2024-05-29T07:06:02] Rose: Hey there Slogo, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-05-29T07:10:58] Yamal: <photos/photo_15295@29-05-2024_07-10-58.jpg>
[2024-05-29T07:36:53] haku: im sure shes good at twerking too
[2024-05-29T07:37:57] haku: lets see her even ride a scooter normally after squating many kilos.
[2024-05-29T07:46:53] Yamal: The worst thing is going down stairs after doing squats.
[2024-05-29T07:48:26] haku: thats why stairs have rails lol
[2024-05-29T07:48:40] Yamal: By the way, leg training is key for racing.
[2024-05-29T07:50:07] haku: yes those french racers almost squat with 1 leg while balancing tgier body weight. impressive stuff
[2024-05-29T07:51:54] haku: its not the pain after the workout that sucks. its the legs pumped full of blood cant even stand normally
[2024-05-29T07:52:22] Yamal: I hadn't thought about it, maybe the person who invented the railing is a bodybuilder
[2024-05-29T07:59:38] haku: lol the comments on this. https://youtube.com/shorts/MOsiwjENV5g?si=N5E90X9Q3RX9ve9Q
[2024-05-29T12:59:34] Yamal: Ubox 85/150 VS Maker 84/200 ?
[2024-05-29T13:00:09] NetworkDir: 85150 ofc
[2024-05-29T13:00:52] NetworkDir: 84200 cheap but have a some issues Ubox more reliable
[2024-05-29T13:12:05] Yamal: üé©
[2024-05-29T13:16:20] Yamal: You have in your zero?
[2024-05-29T13:27:53] NetworkDir: Yes
[2024-05-29T13:28:39] NetworkDir: I just have a throttle noise issue after short hall + phase.
[2024-05-29T13:43:52] Yamal: How many A the phase do you have as controllers, and what peaks do each one give you?
[2024-05-29T13:44:41] NetworkDir: Maximum i use 60A battery current and 180A phase And now i set 50A battery current and 130A phase. Maximum 11kW with 43-44C :)
[2024-05-29T13:52:36] Yamal: Why no 100battery?
[2024-05-29T13:57:02] Alin Ciobanu: I used to use 75100 boxes with 75A of battery and 150A of phase üòÖ
[2024-05-29T14:06:16] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: What motors do you got on this scooter
[2024-05-29T14:07:27] NetworkDir: 50H motors without ferrofluid probably doesn't like +60A
[2024-05-29T14:08:21] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Im running mine on 75a haha
[2024-05-29T14:08:21] Alin Ciobanu: Naaa
[2024-05-29T14:09:28] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Going to put ferofloid when it arrives
[2024-05-29T14:24:06] Yamal: What do you think most determines the peak wtt of a scooter? the controllers Battery the engines the set of everything? These days I'm reviewing the options I have a little and I would like not to go below 20kw.
[2024-05-29T14:27:10] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yeah but G300 overheat and do not work properly on Hub motor, so R350 stay cool at 40¬∞ when G300 up at 90¬∞, I already tested them on my race scooter
[2024-05-29T14:28:11] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: And when G300 mos died all the controller get in fire when Amuminium pcb it just cut the bms never get fire like controller with FR4 pcb
[2024-05-29T14:29:54] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: that's d√©pend of the space the voltage the current target... if you ask me just the most powerful I will think of the 3shul CC1400 1400A 200V lol but it's big and heavy fridge
[2024-05-29T14:32:09] Yamal: Not for ‚Äúg30‚Äù
[2024-05-29T14:32:33] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: If you ask me for Racing E-scooter in 22S I will say R350 or C350 for 20S scooter Spinted 85/200 enough for Surron C700/C1000 for powerful config with Sotion motors or R500 (who are G300 upgraded) for smaller 500A motorbike conf in peak, not current solicited like E-scooter
[2024-05-29T14:33:09] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: for G30 with how much preparation?
[2024-05-29T14:33:40] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Spinted made a new compact 20S controller for not powerful config
[2024-05-29T14:34:00] Yamal: I kidding with g30
[2024-05-29T14:34:29] Yamal: Thanks machine,, ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•üé©
[2024-05-29T14:36:21] Yamal: What do you thing if input in my nami 20s10p 40t 85/150 the work peak I can reach
[2024-05-29T14:36:23] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: On my website I referenced the R150 R350 and R500 also have the 3shul C350 C700 and 1000
[2024-05-29T14:36:56] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: for upper than 22S 3shul CL or Tronic X12 should be good but I never tested the X12 actually
[2024-05-29T14:44:50] Yamal: In short, spintend is gaining more and more points!
[2024-05-29T14:46:37] Yamal: and the The price of the mini spintend is very attractive, also its dimensions, on the other hand I don't know if its power will be somewhat scarce.. :(
[2024-05-29T14:48:23] Rose: Hey there Winds hide me, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-05-29T14:54:51] Rose: Hey there Winds hide me, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-05-29T14:56:57] luffydnoob: Hello there
[2024-05-29T14:57:08] luffydnoob: I'm new to this community üòÄ
[2024-05-29T15:03:09] Yamal: Hello welcome! where are you from ? What scooter do you own and what is your performance? üòÅüòÇ
[2024-05-29T15:05:00] luffydnoob: From Morocco but residing in Spain. Have mantis 10 lite with upgraded battery to 60v single motor version
[2024-05-29T15:05:32] Yamal: Marhaban
[2024-05-29T15:05:52] Yamal: Im. Spain to ( Granada )
[2024-05-29T15:06:57] luffydnoob: How cool üòÑ
[2024-05-29T15:07:49] luffydnoob: It is a decent machine top speed I could achieve was 60km/h with me on top I weigh 60kg
[2024-05-29T15:30:19] haku: you think it can match bac 8k power or fardriver 961120
[2024-05-29T15:57:51] haku: just waking sorry 961800 is what i meant. there is also a mythical 842500 one.
[2024-05-29T16:03:06] haku: gotcha. thanks. hopefully you can flash one of those to run vesc

[2024-05-29T18:08:21] NetworkDir: I trying to optimize some settings For current controller decoupling what do you advise?
[2024-05-29T19:24:50] Yamal: https://youtu.be/PcUvOJ_JrYc?si=_GXfrcqd4FJJo934
[2024-05-29T19:43:35] JPPL: Hm3000
[2024-05-29T19:47:50] Noname: Yeah my friend has one
[2024-05-29T19:48:00] JPPL: I heard this few months ago so that's why everyone stop using them. Last year a lot of vesc development in general, who knows if continues evolving, but in general it's obvious that this sizes are more or less the minimum we can get to maintain their cooling/performance well.
[2024-05-29T19:48:07] Yamal: Wich type controller
[2024-05-29T19:48:23] Noname: Idk stock
[2024-05-29T19:48:46] Noname: K6 left k4 right.
[2024-05-29T19:48:58] Noname: It's 134v so begode I'd guess
[2024-05-29T19:50:05] JPPL: Check suspension, need some lubrificant somewhere üòÇ
[2024-05-29T19:50:16] JPPL: <video_file>
[2024-05-29T19:50:54] Yamal: Cool üòÅ
[2024-05-29T19:51:01] Noname: Doggo help find the sqeeks
[2024-05-29T19:51:07] Yamal: Your controller mAn!
[2024-05-29T19:51:20] Yamal: https://youtu.be/fazz-7wwf7o?si=1XSwq5rDZuaODDJ2
[2024-05-29T19:51:50] Noname: What?
[2024-05-29T19:52:45] Yamal: The video I send,,
[2024-05-29T19:53:02] Noname: Didn't watch
[2024-05-29T19:54:41] JPPL: Crazy ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2024-05-29T19:58:58] Yamal: After asking, asking and asking, comparing different options, if I can't solve my esc in a cheap way, I get into a couple of those from spintend
[2024-05-29T19:59:48] JPPL: He handle nice the wooble, seems to make part of his style üòÇ
[2024-05-29T20:00:40] Noname: Skimmed it they just turned up stock controller. What am I missing?
[2024-05-29T20:02:23] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: je don't know I don't play with anything else than Vesc
[2024-05-29T20:02:28] Yamal: The other day I shared the video of the kid talking about his ultra
[2024-05-29T20:03:31] Noname: lol idk mabey super late night reading. We're on different time zones
[2024-05-29T20:03:35] haku: what country is this? this is cool
[2024-05-29T20:03:41] Yamal: https://youtu.be/l3meTHSzMio?si=uWvG8Xs5t0sKXajH
[2024-05-29T20:04:43] Yamal: The look is not very exciting, but the performance is pretty
[2024-05-29T20:06:28] Noname: Ah good to know they're capable of Ludacris speeds. Mabey if I ever have money
[2024-05-29T20:07:20] Noname: Still only 11p20s 21700 will fit though. And I like range so no p42a
[2024-05-29T20:08:56] haku: prismatic battery and the 110h motor is cool
[2024-05-29T20:11:34] haku: i think this is what amy was telling me about before. a guy making the fastest spintend scooter in russia
[2024-05-29T20:19:36] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-05-29T20:19:49] Noname: Is there a loss in range with larger motors? Say keeping same power etc
[2024-05-29T20:20:47] sombre_enfant: R500 is based on g300 ? Like ambrosini
[2024-05-29T20:21:11] haku: no idea. but these russians are wild. too bad we dont see enough of thier creations here
[2024-05-29T20:25:12] Yamal: normally with speed motors torque is lost
[2024-05-29T20:25:57] Yamal: I don't think he talks about the winding in the video,,
[2024-05-29T20:27:23] Yamal: https://youtu.be/FET__7Z89qY?si=D2a0_1QfyeghGiyL
[2024-05-29T21:00:33] Noname: Just saying if you go from 60h to 70h but keep power same is same power used?
[2024-05-29T21:01:17] Noname: Idk what motors he has but looks like no loss of torque it it wheelies
[2024-05-29T21:02:09] Noname: Like if I went from stock to LY 70h is it just gonna chew up battery cruising
[2024-05-29T21:02:18] haku: those are the same motors like those killer quad gay scooters i tgink
[2024-05-29T21:02:37] Noname: Ah missing point
[2024-05-29T21:03:01] Noname: Finally
[2024-05-29T21:03:11] Noname: üëç
[2024-05-29T21:04:09] Noname: Just gotta let them know who's boss once and a while, no time to die need to pay off house
[2024-05-29T21:05:22] Noname: Don't race a car with a laptop plugged in. Don't race a scooter with external controllers and huge motor cables lol
[2024-05-29T21:09:03] haku: idk maybe i turned gay but my opinion on scooters chamged lately. i think a scooter should be small like a g30 or something portable.if you riding these huge scooters might aswell get something with big wheels and lots of space
[2024-05-29T21:10:14] haku: standing is just wind resistance
[2024-05-29T21:17:40] Yamal: For me, it really isn't worth going from 60h to 70h, unless the phases were small and you wanted to go to 10mm2 for more security and to be able to measure a nice discharge.
[2024-05-29T21:20:27] Noname: Also hall sensors. Idk what my stock cables can handle already 2x power
[2024-05-29T21:20:58] Noname: Might just get a rear 75h
[2024-05-29T21:21:12] Noname: Front just spins now anyway
[2024-05-29T21:25:37] Yamal: You already have what you need and it is powerful electronics, in the end we have to set goals with our scooters too, you are sure that with the motors you have you can get a good top speed!
[2024-05-29T21:27:31] Yamal: I have been able to get good speed out of mine with smaller electronics, and 60h engines.
[2024-05-29T21:34:25] Yamal: I personally like to run and do strong rides, play with the e-scooter and feel its power, from the first hour they told me that the battery with discharge batteries was essential, due to temperature, safety, etc., In short, to reach 110/115 km per hour it doesn't take much and it is a more than acceptable and enjoyable speed! In fact, for me, being able to reach 120kmh in an explosive and fast way is enough.
[2024-05-29T22:10:02] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: not like Ambrosini bro, it's more than one year we work on it, he just looked my website and make Google lens on my website find the product and sell
[2024-05-29T22:10:28] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Ambrosini make nothing, he just copy and sell nothing else
[2024-05-29T22:11:03] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: and he order Paper board, watch and shit with Ambrosini rebrand ü§£
[2024-05-29T22:11:30] Yamal: üëç
[2024-05-29T22:30:10] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: he just sell a nami motor with with another winding yea
[2024-05-29T22:31:16] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: and they shunt the nami controller probably to get more phase current to balance the kv higher
[2024-05-29T22:31:40] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yes he know nothing, just copy others
[2024-05-29T22:32:08] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it's exactly that
[2024-05-29T22:32:14] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: marketing boy
[2024-05-29T22:32:25] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but he sell more than me
[2024-05-29T22:32:41] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: marketer are more powerful than competent
[2024-05-29T22:33:19] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it's my fault they use Spinted and MakerX now
[2024-05-29T22:33:35] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: stupid me to add it in my website
[2024-05-29T22:34:18] Yamal: Raphael, here in Spain we are starting the races, you are light years ahead of us, here there are many kids who want to compete and prepare their scooter, I imagine it is the same as in France
[2024-05-29T22:35:16] Yamal: At the level of preparation, electronics, everything, we are much further behind!
[2024-05-29T22:35:47] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: I don't know but I saw Ambrosini shit story with Spinted and G300
[2024-05-29T22:36:20] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: you not starting race, it's been time you have race then
[2024-05-29T22:36:40] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: and it's nice Spanish are more invested in race than French I guess
[2024-05-29T22:37:00] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: and even much more in wheel
[2024-05-29T22:38:59] Yamal: Let's see, this year is the first with an Official """ championship from the hand of xelectric, there is no federation or anything, last year were some loose races, come on yaaaa
[2024-05-29T22:39:19] Yamal: ^^'
[2024-05-29T22:40:28] Yamal: and about Ambrosini I prefer not to give an opinion, I don't like to speak badly about people,,,,
[2024-05-29T22:41:11] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: we don't talk bad just say facts
[2024-05-29T22:41:15] Yamal: As they say in Pirates of the Caribbean: "Devastate what you see and don't be generous"üòÅ
[2024-05-29T22:41:51] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it's really official this year?
[2024-05-29T22:43:29] Yamal: Yes they call,, but still dont have federation
[2024-05-29T22:43:33] Yamal: You are also starting now on your own like the one who says you have to find a good blonde, young salesperson with a flamenco guitar body.
[2024-05-29T22:43:53] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: hahaha üòÇ
[2024-05-29T22:44:17] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yeah isn't official, but I saw it they still made weird arrangement to win always
[2024-05-29T22:44:42] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: they are not impartial
[2024-05-29T22:44:54] Yamal: I know all‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
[2024-05-29T22:44:54] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: they did many weird things
[2024-05-29T22:45:11] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: even recently I saw when Rage been there
[2024-05-29T22:46:49] Yamal: I repeat, this is all very new, this in Spain, believe me, until very very recently the Ambrosini team had standard electronics, with that I tell you everything...
[2024-05-29T23:01:14] Noname: We will see. Next year hopefully 20s11p. The power is good would like to bump up to about 14kw. Mabey use stock motors till I hurt them.
[2024-05-29T23:06:31] Noname: Idk hit like 11kw
[2024-05-29T23:06:47] Noname: Haven't done a full charge blast yet.
[2024-05-29T23:07:00] Noname: Usually later on in the day I get spicy
[2024-05-29T23:09:26] Yamal: If I see it I don't believe it,, the one with the long routes:D
[2024-05-29T23:10:04] Yamal: I also love the routes!
[2024-05-29T23:11:58] Yamal: But come on, you should make more than 20kw, right?
[2024-05-29T23:12:48] Noname: Well the extra battery on forks is where my charger was mounted. It's freaking heavy so yeah want all the battery inside. Plus it's top heavy and tips the scooter when parked
[2024-05-29T23:13:28] Noname: They're mj1 cells I don't want to push them
[2024-05-29T23:14:22] Noname: And Sanyo ncr18650ga
[2024-05-29T23:18:02] Noname: My segway c80 sit scooter is currently getting a 20s12p
[2024-05-29T23:18:12] Noname: <photos/photo_15298@29-05-2024_23-18-12.jpg>
[2024-05-29T23:18:12] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Noname has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-05-29T23:19:34] Yamal: Moto?üõµ
[2024-05-29T23:20:43] haku: im jelly
[2024-05-29T23:22:55] Noname: Yeah I have a qs212 70h v4 motor for it and a Nucular 24f.
[2024-05-29T23:23:27] NetworkDir: @jamessoderstrom Today i put 50A battery current and 130A phase Scooter acceleration better also motos cold. Looks my cable's cant handle more current and voltage drop
[2024-05-29T23:25:39] Yamal: <photos/photo_15300@29-05-2024_23-25-39.jpg>
[2024-05-29T23:26:41] Noname: Then it's cheaper and I'm üòä
[2024-05-29T23:26:45] haku: what the rear suspension look like?
[2024-05-29T23:27:09] Noname: I microwaving dinner hold
[2024-05-29T23:30:00] Noname: <photos/photo_15301@29-05-2024_23-30-00.jpg>
[2024-05-29T23:40:16] Yamal: Can you put 100A battery normally?
[2024-05-29T23:41:15] Yamal: Or 150A battery / 150A motor maybe is nice ??!
[2024-05-29T23:41:29] luffydnoob: But going at such high speeds you don't have any problems with police üòÇ
[2024-05-29T23:42:47] Yamal: all on a private circuit or track with supervision of an adultüòÅ
[2024-05-29T23:43:10] Noname: We say it was filmed in "Mexico" around here
[2024-05-29T23:43:46] Noname: Idk if I want to do 120 often mabey just to scare myself a lil
[2024-05-29T23:43:53] NetworkDir: Not good idea
[2024-05-29T23:44:11] NetworkDir: I have a dual setup 50-50A battery and 130A phase really fine
[2024-05-29T23:44:16] NetworkDir: Very powerful
[2024-05-29T23:44:34] NetworkDir: Also range with vesc compared shitty squarewave very long Today i do 35km with 5-6kW and now i have a 65% battery :D
[2024-05-29T23:45:15] Yamal: Like this ubox no can put 100A battery :(
[2024-05-29T23:45:23] Noname: What is your kw per kmh
[2024-05-29T23:46:11] luffydnoob: Does anyone here understand wiring of dualtron minimotors 60v 30a
[2024-05-29T23:46:43] NetworkDir: Unfortunately i don't measure because when stop i turn off vesc. Vesc express really needed
[2024-05-29T23:47:44] Noname: Says 35
[2024-05-29T23:48:10] NetworkDir: But sometimes i stop on road and .. with this data I can't analyze correctly
[2024-05-29T23:48:51] Noname: If I'm doing my math correctly I'm 30
[2024-05-29T23:49:24] NetworkDir: Actually 72V 30Ah something like 2400Wh with vesc Should easily can do 120km Dualtron users should cry about it XD
[2024-05-29T23:50:28] Noname: At 75km I'm 25% battery 4200wh
[2024-05-29T23:50:47] Noname: But doing 48kmh
[2024-05-29T23:55:59] sombre_enfant: No bc these ass hole who manage race dont understand that most of us live in Lyon or nearby they all do it near Paris also the price to compete is homongus as much as for moto race...
[2024-05-29T23:57:42] Yamal: How much does it cost to enter a race there?
[2024-05-29T23:58:53] sombre_enfant: They use modified kelly for more PA @92v on jordi scooter also they try now to get on vesc they rebrand voyage display... 300‚Ç¨ its not as good as smart display lor the russian display...
[2024-05-29T23:59:00] Yamal: 1 controller
[2024-05-30T00:00:09] Yamal: That's why I mean I prefer to aim higher than the super mini spintend.
[2024-05-30T00:01:43] Yamal: ah! Are you talking about how expensive it is here in Spain to sign up for races? more than in France?
[2024-05-30T00:03:51] sombre_enfant: No i mean for France they do it at the wrong location. More than half the ppl are from Lyon they should do it on the nearby track
[2024-05-30T00:06:09] sombre_enfant: A week of race by my calculation was nearly 500‚Ç¨ because of the location and price to be on track the thing aint developped enough to charge that much... We compete with 3-7k machine for most of us... Its not motogp with 20-50k moto
[2024-05-30T00:07:23] sombre_enfant: Not me just being cheap but u feel me its already expensive if u make it even harder its not worth it i can cruise like on a track in my city if i dont get caught or hit sum
[2024-05-30T00:09:01] sombre_enfant: I was really ready to go bought the gear tuned even more my scooter had to manage weight issue but at the end of the day its not worth the hassle just to go flex your config all alone
[2024-05-30T00:09:12] Yamal: Who decides the circuits?
[2024-05-30T00:09:23] sombre_enfant: Some old man i think
[2024-05-30T00:09:56] Yamal: The fat one white hair ?
[2024-05-30T00:10:11] sombre_enfant: He couldve checked with rage mechanics to manage it
[2024-05-30T00:10:18] sombre_enfant: If u say so
[2024-05-30T00:10:49] Alin Ciobanu: What is the limitation on the weight?
[2024-05-30T00:10:54] sombre_enfant: Well i guess its him idk how it works
[2024-05-30T00:10:59] sombre_enfant: 38kg light category
[2024-05-30T00:11:19] Yamal: üò≠
[2024-05-30T00:11:21] Alin Ciobanu: Does the vsett 10+ exceed it?
[2024-05-30T00:11:52] sombre_enfant: Yall translator are made by indie speaking english ?
[2024-05-30T00:13:00] Alin Ciobanu: Booo, yes üòÇ
[2024-05-30T00:15:23] sombre_enfant: No it dont well i need to check with 11" tire... But the weight limit is also bullshit since they allowed +2kg...
[2024-05-30T00:16:59] sombre_enfant: Thats how u have g30 with 80H and 1.5kg flipsky competing in that category who wouldve been completly lost in race category
[2024-05-30T00:18:13] Yamal: I understand you brother, I believe that you have people close to you who are influential in the championship to whom you can comment on what you are saying, is there something to lose? NO!. In the end this is an expensive sport and unfortunately it never rains to everyone's liking.... but suggest that they do one of the races near Lyon which is where the cream is, it is not easy for us to go to the races either, ,, accommodation,, registration,, let your scooter work...,, apartment for the weekend,, family...but little by little things are arriving, Another option is to get a rich girlfriend and have her take you to the races in her car, so yes!!!
[2024-05-30T00:24:16] sombre_enfant: Yeah i been day dreamin abt what u say in your last sentences for year but its not happening unfortunately
[2024-05-30T00:24:47] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: Something similar happens in Spain, the xelextrics races are all in the southeast and if you add travel hours, accommodation and the cost of the race it is not profitable, in addition to the fact that there is no type of financial prize. It shows that the championship is designed for certain people without thinking about attendance, only about making money....
[2024-05-30T00:25:50] sombre_enfant: Yeah its the same thing here... But been for decade everything go in the capital here while the source of it aint from there
[2024-05-30T00:26:52] Yamal: The best thing for an enthusiastic competitor is that a brand sponsors him, then the suffering and economic headaches are over, and he only has to train and compete.
[2024-05-30T00:27:33] haku: get the 12fet. would be cool to see the limits of the mini spintend though
[2024-05-30T00:28:44] sombre_enfant: If i remember theres 3 swiss, one from a french island, And all rage team so 5 ppl i think, RFP, a shop all nearby Lyon not like we have track here and most ppl with serious tuned scooter are from Lyon also
[2024-05-30T00:29:24] haku: thats the best part about vesc. small like a conceal carry.
[2024-05-30T00:29:40] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: If here in Spain it were in the capital at least it would be centralized and it wouldn't be so much travel but I live in the north, going to the south where most races take more than 8 hours one way and another 8 hours back. We must keep in mind that this is still amateurish, people have work, families and instead of making things easier they make it more difficult.
[2024-05-30T00:29:47] sombre_enfant: From Paris theres one shop team so 3 riders all other are from random city so it dont change for them
[2024-05-30T00:30:45] Yamal: Fastride? Have many people I see
[2024-05-30T00:31:40] sombre_enfant: Yeah for real im all alone no team or frien in that stuff so it dont help at all and cant waste a week end and allat of money and maybe not compete because it rain or other stuff
[2024-05-30T00:31:43] Yamal: Let's see and what do Rage and Rafa think about all this?
[2024-05-30T00:32:34] sombre_enfant: Theyre many because its nearby and they pay to have their tag on the ad also its a shop we dont have the sale range of money...
[2024-05-30T00:34:54] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: I understand you, we are a team of 4 people and many times it is difficult to go due to lack of time, if the races were closer it would be easier. Let's hope it changes in the future.
[2024-05-30T00:37:15] Yamal: I'm the same in my city, huh? There is not a single one that looks at the circuits, for routes there is, but zero competition
[2024-05-30T00:37:41] sombre_enfant: Wym by team tho just a group with the same profile or u make or do it for the money ? Its clearly no the sale thing when u gain nothing in it or when u can promote your brand/shop
[2024-05-30T00:38:38] Yamal: My future is defined in a fidoo up to the teeth of molicel and vesc and Asian food 24/7
[2024-05-30T00:38:57] Yamal: :()
[2024-05-30T00:43:01] Yamal: But remember what I'm going to tell you, if you ever hear a loud humming sound coming from South East Asia, with the smell of racing and highly competitive scooters, don't be surprised!!!!!!!! that we will be working on it
[2024-05-30T00:45:33] sombre_enfant: Btw i see your mantis have cst 10x3 did u tried them on track ? Or wet track ? Because on my rwd scoot i slipped many time with them...
[2024-05-30T00:48:49] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: We are a team of friends, we do not have any stores or businesses in this sector, we like it and we do it as a hobby.
[2024-05-30T00:50:28] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: On the track I have only tried PMT, I wore the cst for a season on the street and they work well on dry ground, in the wet they are a real danger.
[2024-05-30T07:01:05] Yamal: good morning ,! @roscheeee how are you how about you Gt2 and the unknown x12
[2024-05-30T07:09:26] Yamal: I miss your motivational videos working on e-scooters,,,,:(
[2024-05-30T07:22:18] Yamal: https://youtu.be/VMPUwPWd2Qk?si=biVeYyI6GNXTiwh5
[2024-05-30T07:22:52] Yamal: Haku your e bike
[2024-05-30T07:40:06] haku: hehe i wish. those are nice
[2024-05-30T07:42:21] haku: too much bling. a nice and simple one would be great
[2024-05-30T07:42:57] Yamal: By the way, what temperature range do you think is normal and safe for Vesc controllers as a general rule?
[2024-05-30T10:09:10] Yamal: https://youtu.be/LmTQmE_kbo8?si=SDrH6d7amaZ5QjYE
[2024-05-30T10:47:37] GABE: Looks insane lmfao
[2024-05-30T11:36:44] Rose: Hey there 88484, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2024-05-30T12:32:00] Rose: Hey there El, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-05-30T12:54:44] El: /settings
[2024-05-30T13:31:05] Oreo huzky: Weight 2 tons
[2024-05-30T13:38:00] Yamal: Weight don‚Äôt know
[2024-05-30T13:38:56] Yamal: It would be nice if you shared a photo of your scooter with your powerful electronics.üòÅ
[2024-05-30T13:45:15] Oreo huzky: <photos/photo_15304@30-05-2024_13-45-15.jpg>
[2024-05-30T13:47:36] Yamal: Scooter brand ?
[2024-05-30T13:48:10] Yamal: Laotie or halo
[2024-05-30T13:48:36] Noname: 48kmh with hacked software
[2024-05-30T13:48:55] Noname: Still a snail
[2024-05-30T13:49:25] Oreo huzky: Bought the parts separately but frame is similar to laotie
[2024-05-30T13:49:51] Yamal: Do you have an extra battery?
[2024-05-30T13:51:57] Oreo huzky: No build it myself 20s 8p Molicel p42a
[2024-05-30T13:53:11] Yamal: In the bag then what are you carrying, the esc?
[2024-05-30T13:54:16] Oreo huzky: Battery
[2024-05-30T13:55:06] Yamal: That's what I was referring to. You carry 2 batteries, one under your feet and the extra one on the mast.
[2024-05-30T13:55:09] Oreo huzky: Before that I had 20s 8p in bag and 10s8p in battery bay now I only have 20s8p because I have cl350 v4
[2024-05-30T13:55:31] Yamal: I know your esc ü§©
[2024-05-30T13:56:41] Yamal: What kw did you reach?
[2024-05-30T13:57:53] Yamal: I am not asking you about anything in particular but about everything about your preparation, it is exciting to see how the different scooters work, with different batteries and esc
[2024-05-30T13:59:10] Oreo huzky: <photos/photo_15305@30-05-2024_13-59-10.jpg>
[2024-05-30T13:59:20] Oreo huzky: Yea it‚Äôs shitty
[2024-05-30T14:02:13] Yamal: What is your configuration like? This electronic is at the top and even more so for high performance scooters at 22s, bad experiences or accidents we all have, believe me
[2024-05-30T14:05:42] Oreo huzky: Nah cl350 sucks ass atleast it did for me it ranges from randomly braking and bad customer service
[2024-05-30T14:08:56] Yamal: It's your opinion and it's respectable.
[2024-05-30T14:10:39] Oreo huzky: I had it in my WhatsApp status and I didn‚Äôt want my mom to see ü•≤
[2024-05-30T14:11:07] Oreo huzky: Yes it was my experience and a few others also agreed
[2024-05-30T14:24:33] Yamal: How many A phase are you wearing and how many A battery? By the way, I see a 14v drop, was it with your good battery or with the previous one?
[2024-05-30T14:38:02] Oreo huzky: With mine
[2024-05-30T14:38:24] Oreo huzky: I think 120A dc per motor and 260A phase per motor
[2024-05-30T14:39:32] Yamal: You can't add more motor phase, because of your motors, right? that do not come with phases of 10
[2024-05-30T14:40:19] Oreo huzky: I don‚Äôt know i think i could phase wires only get to room temperature
[2024-05-30T14:41:50] Yamal: <photos/photo_15306@30-05-2024_14-41-50.jpg>
[2024-05-30T14:43:52] Yamal: What I don't understand is why your battery drops "so much"
[2024-05-30T14:45:18] Yamal: I'm already a little lost with this topic, because you really had around 500 phase and 21kw... Maybe some professor can clarify this matter...
[2024-05-30T14:48:25] Yamal: Do you think that everything is normal and correct with the performance he has?
[2024-05-30T14:50:36] Yamal: do you have a heat sink?
[2024-05-30T14:55:31] Oreo huzky: Lots of powa
[2024-05-30T14:55:53] Oreo huzky: I have mounted it to frame with thermal paste and screws
[2024-05-30T14:59:23] Oreo huzky: Where can you see the voltage drop?
[2024-05-30T15:00:00] Yamal: nothing, let's see if you do some acceleration test or a top speed so we can see that wonderful scooter on vesc tool dancing
[2024-05-30T15:00:30] Yamal: Ah drawn ,, first one
[2024-05-30T15:03:45] Oreo huzky: Is the ah drawn even correct because my battery is only 32ah
[2024-05-30T15:10:20] Happy Giraffe: Thats the amount of capacity used, voltage drop is different thing
[2024-05-30T15:10:52] Happy Giraffe: BMS app or externally wired meter
[2024-05-30T15:12:43] GABE: 70h so slow?
[2024-05-30T15:12:44] GABE: Lmao
[2024-05-30T15:22:23] Yamal: Well, because of a post I made months ago, I was told that my voltage had dropped 10v,, so, this statement was an error,,,
[2024-05-30T15:26:28] Yamal: I asked if day where I could look at the battery A's and I was told that higher in the application next to the voltage,,, little more,, for example I do not have discharge BMS, so I would not be able to see it this way ..
[2024-05-30T15:36:36] Happy Giraffe: Yes, if connectors and cabling is good then vesc should also give quite accurate data
[2024-05-30T15:37:33] Happy Giraffe: Cant make any sense what you say YamalüòÇ
[2024-05-30T15:42:53] Yamal: I mean that from the beginning I misunderstood the drop voltage, I mean I don't know where you got that my voltage dropped to 10v...üòÇ

[2024-05-30T16:01:17] Yamal: Thanks
[2024-05-30T16:14:37] Yamal: I suppose that by recording the screen there we can obtain: battery-voltage that our battery drops I battery- Amps that our battery delivers?
[2024-05-30T16:18:43] Lisa: Bought his vsett 10+ off hahaha

[2024-05-30T22:21:29] Yamal: This couple is cool, the way they explain things, they make mediocre or normal things good, you see your dualtron "togo" because it makes you want to buy one
[2024-05-30T22:25:38] haku: yea i like watching these guys compared to that ginger guy
[2024-05-30T22:34:52] Yamal: Any progress with your e-scooter, or do you directly want to make an e-bike?
[2024-05-30T22:35:26] haku: no progress but planing my emoto
[2024-05-30T22:35:35] haku: or moped

[2024-05-30T22:37:13] Yamal: Like weped expander
[2024-05-30T22:37:24] haku: g30 is in the plans.
[2024-05-30T22:42:35] haku: someday i want to have a pev shop and bikes are the choice of americans. have to know how stuff works
[2024-05-30T22:46:54] haku: a shaman told me it will be the end of me
[2024-05-30T22:48:23] haku: after opening my third eye i saw glimpse of my scooter and a ambulance
[2024-05-30T22:49:28] Yamal: üßê
[2024-05-30T22:50:42] Yamal: In the end you have to do what you like and what motivates you and that's it.
[2024-05-30T22:51:33] Yamal: For me, in the world of electric mobility, there is nothing else other than a scooter.
[2024-05-30T22:52:33] NetworkDir: anyone try vesc on EUC ?
[2024-05-30T22:52:36] NetworkDir: ofc with IMU
[2024-05-30T22:57:38] Yamal: I have scooter fever!!! xD
[2024-05-30T22:58:49] Yamal: and when I go to 2 engines I get lost off the map
[2024-05-30T23:38:55] Yamal: where will Benjamin..
[2024-05-30T23:39:15] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Upgrade that *** is one of the best
[2024-05-30T23:39:41] Yamal: Why?
[2024-05-30T23:41:22] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Why ? He is one of the best ?
[2024-05-30T23:41:39] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: He is a real pro in our shit
[2024-05-30T23:42:18] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Just so you'd know that scooter used to be a zero10x
[2024-05-30T23:44:08] Yamal: Controller ?
[2024-05-30T23:48:08] Yamal: I don't know why but I thought it was an 11x,, Do you know of more scooter from these people?
[2024-05-30T23:49:26] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: No they mainly now on custom surrons and inokim oxs because that is the trend here
[2024-05-30T23:49:40] Yamal: <photos/photo_15311@30-05-2024_23-49-40.jpg>
[2024-05-30T23:50:29] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: He is more of a nuc/ASI guy less vesc (he does sells vescs though)
[2024-05-30T23:51:45] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: It's the 10 look at the stem it's a single stem design do u think he would switch from dual stem to single stem. ?
[2024-05-30T23:52:02] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: What is that group?
[2024-05-30T23:55:00] Yamal: Local grupo, nazari Kingdom
[2024-05-30T23:55:18] Noname: Sounds like build from a guy I know
[2024-05-30T23:55:39] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: How did his video got there

[2024-05-30T23:56:43] Yamal: A friend shared it in the group

[2024-05-30T23:58:12] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Everyone knows one guy that would get a ridiculously big chasy for a scooter that had one of the smallest chasys (side note he probably has no steps )
[2024-05-30T23:58:37] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Maybe it is the 11 then ?
[2024-05-30T23:58:55] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: It looks like a mish mash of both
[2024-05-30T23:59:02] Yamal: Are these people Russian or from Israel?
[2024-05-30T23:59:21] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I just don't understand why not go for dual stem if it's a zero10x p
[2024-05-30T23:59:27] Noname: Pevmadness is isreal
[2024-05-30T23:59:36] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: 11x*
[2024-05-30T23:59:39] Noname: He cool guy sold me Nuc parts

[2024-05-31T00:00:32] Noname: Just a U light board
[2024-05-31T00:00:41] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: So you're not from Israel got it
[2024-05-31T00:01:03] haku: can he help you fix it?
[2024-05-31T00:01:07] Noname: All it takes is money and time.
[2024-05-31T00:01:37] Yamal: At first it seemed uglier to me, now seeing it in that last photo I'm starting to like it, I'm very into bac and from what I see there are a few models
[2024-05-31T00:01:44] Noname: Found another guy. He does tear down vids. Again need money
[2024-05-31T00:01:46] haku: what about no money but alot of time?
[2024-05-31T00:01:59] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: You reminded me to get parts for my zero10x from the Russiana I need better stem and more
[2024-05-31T00:02:01] NetworkDir: I dont think zero frame can handle this XD
[2024-05-31T00:02:28] Noname: Those people build g30 with laiote motors and p42a cells
[2024-05-31T00:02:33] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Debodry ?

[2024-05-31T00:05:23] Noname: Yeah he said he can fix my controller. Not a huge job but he knows about controllers so better than a refrigerator repair guy
[2024-05-31T00:05:28] Yamal: he puts on the diaguise at night
[2024-05-31T00:05:43] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: That biatch has a YouTube channel but it is mostly inactive
[2024-05-31T00:05:47] Noname: Oh yeah if you ever message him he tells you
[2024-05-31T00:05:57] Noname: I don't blame him

[2024-05-31T00:08:00] Noname: Lol fardriver vs nuc
[2024-05-31T00:08:55] haku: you a fancy fella
[2024-05-31T00:09:24] Noname: They're such a pain to program if you have no experience. With a lot of scattered info on updates and use a micro SD to update. They now have a Bluetooth module.
[2024-05-31T00:09:50] Yamal: <photos/photo_15313@31-05-2024_00-09-50.jpg>
[2024-05-31T00:10:05] Noname: Where tf would you fit that huge box in a scooter. Nuc is jumbo enough

[2024-05-31T00:32:35] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: <animation>
[2024-05-31T00:32:42] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Hey JPPL you helped me before on suspension what do you think about this case it's a 1000lbs air shock but its going down too much
[2024-05-31T00:34:42] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: And this is with pushing it down not even steeping on it I guess the scooter is too havy for the shock
[2024-05-31T00:35:07] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: And before I get muted I apologize for the filming let my little brother to film it
[2024-05-31T00:41:41] Yamal: There is a real culture around minibikes, they are different concepts.
[2024-05-31T00:42:14] haku: its huge in asia.
[2024-05-31T00:42:25] haku: hawaii too
[2024-05-31T00:43:02] Yamal: There is nothing written about tastes, the nucs look powerful, it is clear, so I wonder why they don't use them to compete, in fact there are some compact models
[2024-05-31T00:49:07] Noname: I just like teasing hiku
[2024-05-31T01:00:04] haku: i was thinking of sending you one of those red envelopes with the china symbols. i changed my mind

[2024-05-31T14:53:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is wrong
[2024-05-31T14:53:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: First is number of wire in parallel, second is turns
[2024-05-31T14:54:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: Normally all escooter motor are made with 0.51mm wire , so 16 x 0,51mm diameter wires in parallelo, and does 4 turn around stator
[2024-05-31T15:01:04] Jan: So i take 16x parallel 0.51mm wires and wind it 4 times around the stator before moving to the next gives me a lower kv than doing 33x parallel 0.51mm wires and wind it 2 times around the stator? If i understand it correctly its (mm^2 copper wires total) x turns around the stator And 0.51mm is just a wire diameter value for common scooter motors, but i could use any wire thickness i just need to get the same mm^2 again) ?
[2024-05-31T15:03:21] Jan: Technically you would take the thickest wire possible that you can still wind?

[2024-05-31T22:20:55] Rogelio Denis: So what decent motor do i need, not need too much power just a little bit more speed, just tops at 65 on air i wanted to get to 75 or so 1200w motor from Apollo Phantom or something similar adding halls should be enough?
[2024-05-31T22:34:47] Happy Giraffe: If you want speed by changing motor, it will reduce the maximum torque if phase amps are not raised to compensate this
[2024-05-31T22:35:12] Happy Giraffe: Also vesc doesn't really need halls, works well without, I would rather install thermistor instead
[2024-05-31T22:40:53] Noname: No halls is fine just get wheels to start rotating no problems with mine
[2024-05-31T22:43:56] Dimitar: It is fine but with halls the control is smoother. In the same time sensorless eliminates the possibility of halls going bad and the need to replace them
[2024-05-31T23:16:29] Rogelio Denis: Of course, already tried that on thr other motor to 80 amps and IS stable but i dont want to Burn It on the long run
[2024-05-31T23:19:55] Rogelio Denis: I choose hall over non hall motor since i want a smooth ride, dont mind having to change halls i am also thinking of going over the Apollo Phantom with a ubox dual controller saw one from spinted that i want to try, still Will be a 52v battery, It IS a v1 and i already did over 40k km with It

[2024-06-01T12:48:14] Yamal: I have also known the electronics, really if you have the electronics low in A phase and well cooled I don't think there will be a problem, it is clear that for circuit or high performance they are not worth it

[2024-06-01T13:10:30] cihan: I'm about to place order for docreate spot welder. It costs me 108 usd including customs tax for Turkey. Aliexpress choice day makes 12 USD discount, it used to cost 120 USD before. Is there a better alternative up to 200 USD. I'll draw no more than 7amps from each cell yet I'm still not sure about battery configuration. It will be at least 80 cells and maximum 105 cells. Should I use 10x0.2 pure nickel or smaller width? Contact resistance could be much higher than resistance of nickel strip so maybe higher width is unnecessary. Cells will be 18650. Is 10mm width too much for working with 18650?
[2024-06-01T13:11:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is actually more powerful than tronic 250
[2024-06-01T13:11:56] Konstantin: G015n10
[2024-06-01T13:12:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: 8mm for 18650
[2024-06-01T13:15:41] Yamal: supposedly to work safely they should not be set to more than 150 A phase, I know there are some who have it at 200A, but come on, the people in this group who have them, I have not yet seen anyone with 20kw or something like that
[2024-06-01T13:15:56] cihan: Thanks for the reply. Do you recommend 8mm because top contact width is 8mm? Could it create hazard if the nickel strip covers isolator on positive terminal?
[2024-06-01T13:20:02] Yamal: I repeat that I like the mini spintend, and I think it is more reliable and stable but I don't see stratospheric numbers with it, and anyone who thinks otherwise should show it, I want to see it!!!!!

[2024-06-01T18:13:19] cihan: @PaoloWu already replied me about nickel strip width for 18650 and told I should use 8mm strips but I would also like to learn your opinion @jamessoderstrom. Is using 10mm width strip unnecessary because of contact resistance being so high and strip resistance is neglectable or isn't it just possible to use 10mm with 18650 because of the cell 's positive contact diameter being small and creating hazard of joining negative and positive poles?
[2024-06-01T18:21:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: Technically, the strip shouldnt cover all the positive pole, as we do. Technically full pattern strip as we use shouldn't be used
[2024-06-01T18:23:06] cihan: Thanks, I skimmed that battery making book a little and 8mm is also mentioned there for 18650 but I will choose 10mm for little more conductivity. I couldn't find a thermal photo of a battery whose nickel connections heating up with high current. Is it the battery contact areas with nickel strip causing most heat or does nickel strip also add up to heat generation?
[2024-06-01T18:23:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because the gap between positive pole and the cell's edge is for safety reason
[2024-06-01T18:23:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: And 10mm strip would cover this space
[2024-06-01T18:24:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: No you didn't understand
[2024-06-01T18:25:46] cihan: I'm also worried about this, thanks. I just wonder how much more conductivity 10mm strip will create over 8mm. It's not worth messing up with 10mm if it's less than 10%.
[2024-06-01T18:26:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: You see the void space on the positive pole?
[2024-06-01T18:26:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: Its needed for safety reason, like when cell overcharge , and it help to avoid flamed
[2024-06-01T18:27:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: So if you cover it , you've less safety for the battery
[2024-06-01T18:27:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: But anyway I prefer less sag XD
[2024-06-01T18:27:41] cihan: Do you make nickel strip connection area same curvature as the battery and sand nickel strip little bit not to cut battery insulation later on?
[2024-06-01T18:28:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you see on professional device like Dyson, or any battery pack which uses cylindrical cell, they never cover this gap
[2024-06-01T18:28:42] cihan: Isn't it ventilation hole for hydrogen gas generated inside cell?
[2024-06-01T18:33:29] cihan: Lastly I would like to ask your opinion about docreate spot welder. I won't be pulling more than 7A from any cell. This welder is capable of welding 0.2mm pure nickel and it's sufficient for me. It has 2 1500F capacitors and reviews justify it's ability to weld 0.2mm pure nickel. @lBabacar already recommended it to me and it costs me 108 USD on this choice day. Is there any better option for 0.3mm nickel under 150-200 USD? @jamessoderstrom üòå

[2024-06-01T18:35:16] cihan: Everything looks great about gt2 except the price.)
[2024-06-01T18:35:24] Yamal: of course to transform it into a Vesc scooter
[2024-06-01T18:35:41] Yamal: Second hand solution
[2024-06-01T18:37:10] cihan: Possible but even finding new is impossible in Turkey. I'm not sure if someone buying this will sell easily and for a good price, he should just be leaving electric scooter probably.
[2024-06-01T18:41:53] Yamal: here the cheapest is at 1600 second hand....
[2024-06-01T18:46:21] cihan: Really cheap if it doesn't have problems. I would buy it now if I could have it for that price.
[2024-06-01T18:46:29] Konstantin: ? Photo?
[2024-06-01T18:52:51] Yamal: That is a bit of an exception but the ones that exist are around ‚Ç¨1800/2200 more or less.
[2024-06-01T18:53:27] cihan: But it's cheap. People sell unused ones from abroad and without warranty for 4000-4500 USD here.
[2024-06-01T18:54:22] cihan: Thank you, could you recommend one you like or use so I'll check it.
[2024-06-01T18:56:14] cihan: I've read a lot about kweld on reddit. People praise it a lot however it's far beyond my budget. By the way some people on reddit say they could only trust kweld for high power batteries.
[2024-06-01T18:58:39] Yamal: I suppose the GT2 has 11" motors up to 70 mm without modification like the other scooters?

[2024-06-01T23:09:39] haku: can you point it on this picture?
[2024-06-01T23:25:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, it's necessary for vent

[2024-06-01T23:31:02] Patrick: Yea but when covering it with tape the vent doesnt really work anyways
[2024-06-01T23:32:59] Patrick: You also got gaps in a spacer so even when covered with lets say copper the gases should be able to leave through the gaps in the spacer
[2024-06-01T23:33:17] Patrick: You know what i mean?
[2024-06-01T23:33:50] NetworkDir: i compiled but it's maybe 6.05 test it

[2024-06-01T23:41:27] cihan: Can I trust aliexpress sellers about purity of nickel strip? There are many with good reviews and good reputation however I couldn't be sure.
[2024-06-01T23:42:14] Patrick: I know my painting sucks but a good Cellholder got 4 points holding the cell and 4 gaps that way the gas can leave on the sides of the copper
[2024-06-01T23:42:15] Patrick: <photos/photo_15343@01-06-2024_23-42-15.jpg>
[2024-06-01T23:44:33] NetworkDir: @jamessoderstrom i think 6.02 deleted but why idk :/ i can't find 6.02 just 6.00 and 6.05 available
[2024-06-01T23:45:17] Patrick: not really, you have to pay close attention, many say pure nickel in the name but in the description it says nickel plated steel
[2024-06-01T23:48:11] haku: i jelly my boy
[2024-06-01T23:48:44] cihan: Thanks, I'll read descriptions. I used to buy some holders with honeycomb pattern but I didn't check if nickel strip will be able to sit on it at that time. I used to buy this one. Should I buy a nickel strip with special type not to have problems? I mean some kind of strip which stays higher for example. Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! US $2.51 48%OFF | 18650 cell battery holder flat head dislocation bracket compact bracket can be spliced, module battery pack bracket https://a.aliexpress.com/_ExokLeJ
[2024-06-01T23:49:50] haku: what do you mean because that area is well insulated with wrap, fishpaper and printed holders.
[2024-06-01T23:51:02] Patrick: Cant really help with that i 3D print my Cellholders and i use Copper but i think there are already nickel stripes for honeycomb Cellholders
[2024-06-01T23:51:47] Patrick: Yea with to much pressure it should start leaving through some tiny holes
[2024-06-01T23:53:10] haku: that is true
[2024-06-01T23:53:48] Patrick: I mean can the Cell even make that much pressure that the small caps that are open arent enough?
[2024-06-01T23:54:07] Patrick: You normaly got more then enough space for the gases
[2024-06-01T23:56:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you pot it is different
[2024-06-01T23:56:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: Without potting no
[2024-06-01T23:57:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: No oxygen = non fire
[2024-06-01T23:58:10] Patrick: True thats even the reason why they keep burning even if you throw sand over them
[2024-06-01T23:58:23] haku: for the boys i will sacrifice a p42 and see how it vents
[2024-06-02T00:00:15] Patrick: Maybe you can try it in something like a small pack just with some dummy Cells around it so we can see how good it works with wrap etc
[2024-06-02T00:00:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: I ve no idea , I just referred what I learned from pro, and I‚Äôm not a pro
[2024-06-02T00:02:43] Hurriicane: I didn't say it burned because of the resin, my friend, pouring resin was stupidity.
[2024-06-02T00:03:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: Anyway there‚Äôs always a technical consideration
[2024-06-02T00:03:30] Hurriicane: You fucked up Vesc
[2024-06-02T00:03:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: G30 pack is 60a rated and working max at half of capability‚Äôs, so the cell works safer than how Dyson battery does
[2024-06-02T00:04:02] Hurriicane: Half of the cables are missing, they are all incomplete and it is not clear what is what üò≤
[2024-06-02T00:04:22] Hurriicane: I didn't say the resin burning was related to me.
[2024-06-02T00:04:28] Patrick: Lets say even when the CID is covered fully isnt the pressure Stretching the wrap at a point anyways?
[2024-06-02T00:05:13] Patrick: And thats only if every gap is fully sealed
[2024-06-02T00:07:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt know, feel free to do what u want since I‚Äôm not a teacher. I just learned this from someone else
[2024-06-02T00:08:37] cihan: It should. I'm not sure about the ventilation hole valve opening pressure but it should be a few atm. That few atm will probably force the wrap open too at a weak part.
[2024-06-02T00:14:34] Patrick: Even with a tiny gap the pressure of every cell should be enough to leave through some tiny gap

[2024-06-02T09:50:52] cihan: Thanks, current was so high, higher than Docreate on test but I don't know why it couldn't solder 0.2 nickel on test in the video. Docreate has a version with foot switch and it has lower resistance than DO-02 model, thicker soldering cables. Docreate with foot switch has 1000A current and that battery operated one has 1400A current. Somehow battery operated one cannot supply same current under resistance probably.

[2024-06-03T02:17:17] cihan: It costs me 108 USD including customs tax for Turkey. This seller has decreased the price and increased shipping probably so tax will be lower for me. There are some sellers who don't ship to Turkey. If you can buy from them and if shipping is free (I didn't check shipping to other countries by selecting different address) it can cost as low as 60 USD. Searching "docreate" doesn't really return all results. Searching "farad capacitor welder" returns better results for do-02 and the other docreate model with foot switch, so you can search that way on AliExpress.
[2024-06-03T02:28:08] haku: i dont personally recomend this brand but alot of folks here has good experience with glitter 801d. i have a different model wich sucks
[2024-06-03T02:35:30] haku: if your just making 1 pack with nickle i would think any welder can handle up to .15
[2024-06-03T02:43:33] cihan: Thanks, I'll also search for it and for reviews too. If I also buy a 3d printer some time I can tuck up whole space with cells inside deck.)
[2024-06-03T02:44:22] cihan: It looks so for me when I buy with coins and use 8usd coupon
[2024-06-03T02:44:49] cihan: It's hard to find many sellers shipping such big items to Turkey.

[2024-06-04T22:05:14] Patrick: I can also only charge with 0.5A new Version got 1A. Build Quality looks pretty good nothing gets hot but its disappointing that only 4 Slots work for me

[2024-06-04T22:13:36] haku: what is more powerful a 50h motor but a larger diameter stator or a smaller stator but larger magnets 80h. lets say both have the same windings
[2024-06-04T22:14:47] haku: like this is a 50h. vs a lonnyo 80h 6.5 scooter motor
[2024-06-04T22:15:24] haku: i see.
[2024-06-04T22:16:20] haku: but the smaller one will heat up faster. if both motors are fed the same power
[2024-06-04T22:18:31] haku: why is that? less heat?
[2024-06-04T22:20:35] Yamal: haku you are full of motorcycles and electric bikes!
[2024-06-04T22:20:59] haku: no dude. just parts

[2024-06-04T23:12:53] haku: if i find a seat for my laotie ill just do that
[2024-06-04T23:13:25] Yamal: Nice , you see the man in Portugal still okay

[2024-06-04T23:15:07] Yamal: I remember a man in America who appears in many videos with Thunder 2 with a seat, I don't like it but it is his choice and I respect it and I share it and if it is for health? Let Troy burn!
[2024-06-04T23:17:16] Noname: This is seated and electric?

[2024-06-04T23:50:50] haku: a frame like that roadrunner that would fit 13" 70h would be great.
[2024-06-04T23:55:23] Noname: Minibike frame and mabey bigger tires? You could fit enough batterys to go to Nebraska and back. Road trip!
[2024-06-04T23:56:12] Noname: Crouched over on a roadrunner and you have a bad back?
[2024-06-04T23:56:27] haku: no. just legs

[2024-06-05T00:36:54] GABE: OR to sign a prenup.
[2024-06-05T00:44:18] Yamal: I'm just joking, life has to be taken with a lot of humor, we are in crazy times, in which everything has changed a lot and a lot of things have been lost at all levels (my opinion) That's why Benjamin came, to give light with Vesc Beta to these dark and shadowy times.
[2024-06-05T00:50:55] Yamal: I sometimes think about it, imagine that Benjamin configured your scooter,??ü§Øü§Øü§Ø, it would be the perfect machine, efficiency, top speed, torque, freezing temperatures, explosiveness,, shame it's not in this group,, but I still I haven't thrown in the towel
[2024-06-05T01:01:13] sombre_enfant: No.
[2024-06-05T01:06:16] Yamal: Question
[2024-06-05T01:06:47] GABE: He would have to actually be beside your scooter to tune it right
[2024-06-05T01:06:54] Yamal: Best scooter to compete for -38 other than a g30?
[2024-06-05T01:07:49] GABE: But sure it would be

[2024-06-05T07:57:32] Yamal: I was about to set up Ubox killer! but sometimes you have to know how to stop the car, I already have a ride on and off with this skate that takes a long time, breakdowns, and I'm not convinced by the electronics where it is placed, I am a person who takes the skate 24 /7 a solutely every day and for everything, the standard one comes very well sealed, etc. so I just change the frame, wipe the slate clean and start from scratch...

[2024-06-05T16:07:28] haku: nothing here mentioned rage mechanics. how do you know that?
[2024-06-05T16:07:49] GABE: I just assumed since forever that Shull is made by rage??

[2024-06-06T17:10:50] haku: its a laotie inside all that carbon
[2024-06-06T17:12:59] Jan: Its actually the ESC scooter that Williams F1 engineered
[2024-06-06T17:18:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: Cheaper and faster
[2024-06-06T17:19:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: You need more certification if you want more than 14s
[2024-06-06T17:21:09] haku: that williams scooter all western parts?
[2024-06-06T17:23:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: More than 55v technically you need safety certification if you're a serious company
[2024-06-06T17:23:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: Specially if engaged for race purpose and similar
[2024-06-06T17:23:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: No need
[2024-06-06T17:24:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: I still think how china monowheel can be sold

[2024-06-06T18:23:43] cihan: I've got no idea about the model but ender 3 v3 se has a discount now and I can buy it for 230 USD. Should I go for it?
[2024-06-06T18:29:13] cihan: Almost all people complain about wobbly frame but I can print slower and time is not an issue for me if it prevents wobbling, I've never used a 3d printer before so I'm totally without an idea.
[2024-06-06T19:37:14] Happy Giraffe: Now bambulab printers on heavy discount, cheapes A1 mini 199‚Ç¨...
[2024-06-06T19:43:07] Jan: A1 for what?
[2024-06-06T19:43:07] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Quick question can I connect 75200 and 75100pro over can ?
[2024-06-06T19:43:16] Jan: X1 Carbon with AMS if
[2024-06-06T19:43:25] NetworkDir: Yes should work
[2024-06-06T19:44:33] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: What should I watch out for ?
[2024-06-06T19:44:56] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Don't want to burn them in summer (riding season)
[2024-06-06T19:45:13] NetworkDir: just check pins and sockets
[2024-06-06T19:45:24] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Even if one from makerbase and one flipaky ?
[2024-06-06T19:45:35] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Yes to much of curse
[2024-06-06T19:45:38] NetworkDir: should work at all
[2024-06-06T19:45:49] NetworkDir: but maybe like punedir have a can chip problems
[2024-06-06T19:55:44] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: @punedir
[2024-06-06T20:01:22] Happy Giraffe: 330‚Ç¨ or something for regular A1
[2024-06-06T20:25:53] Jan: A bargain for sure
[2024-06-06T20:26:28] Jan: but its a regular used machine that will be used for 10 years. Could also invest some more into something more decent flexible and reliable
[2024-06-06T20:36:54] JPPL: Every vesc is compatible, software version is what matters and properly configed
[2024-06-06T20:45:07] GABE: Of course!!!
[2024-06-06T20:45:19] GABE: VESC + VESC = ‚úÖ
[2024-06-06T20:46:14] Happy Giraffe: The A1 mini I bought been amazing
[2024-06-06T20:46:35] Jan: Never heard a bad thing about Bambu so far
[2024-06-06T20:46:43] Happy Giraffe: Now printing tool holders for MazaküòÇ
[2024-06-06T20:59:45] GABE: can someone revolut me 5‚Ç¨ for some beer?
[2024-06-06T21:16:25] GABE: nvm we good
[2024-06-06T21:18:53] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: So same software even though different vescs?
[2024-06-06T21:25:11] El: no, the apps are different and not always compatible
[2024-06-06T21:27:09] El: or study the source code or check with your hands one by one , each brands controller has its own application and they are not interchangeable
[2024-06-06T21:32:37] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Flipaky and makerbase 75series are basically the same no ?
[2024-06-06T21:37:18] El: https://trampaboards.com/vesc--c-1434.html firmware are not compatible with https://flipsky.net/collections/electronic-products

[2024-06-06T22:00:41] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I'm talking about very Similar vesc from companies that copy each other
[2024-06-06T22:00:59] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: 75100w200
[2024-06-06T22:01:46] El: ‚ò∫Ô∏è
[2024-06-06T22:05:22] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: My problem is that even if it is compatible I'm getting for front motor same power that I programed for the rear
[2024-06-06T22:05:48] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I mean how do people with dual normally deal with that ?
[2024-06-06T22:06:17] cihan: Are they better overall compared to ender v3 se? I think ender v3 se is considered to be among worst 3d printers. I feel like 3d printers will get cheaper soon
[2024-06-06T22:11:00] Happy Giraffe: Ender is major crap, Bambu never failed me

[2024-06-06T22:30:27] haku: yes. bambulab. the p1s will lower its price too soon ive heard
[2024-06-06T22:32:39] haku: here i was looking at the other day.
[2024-06-06T22:38:16] Yamal: üî•
[2024-06-06T22:45:47] haku: nevet had a ender but folks say the new creality will be competing with bambu
[2024-06-06T22:46:25] Happy Giraffe: Buy Bambulab, now its crazy discounts
[2024-06-06T22:49:57] JPPL: Each vesc hardware have theirs costum software vesc version, if it's the same compilation version number(ex 6.02 and 6.02 or 5.3 and 5.3) you can put different hardware working together( ex flipsky and makers base or others)
[2024-06-06T22:50:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's not a suspension, this scooter doesn't have any suspension, I have seen it without the fiber covers
[2024-06-06T22:50:44] JPPL: What will not work is 5.3 and 6.02 on same setup, it's possible btw but not common
[2024-06-06T22:51:23] Face de Pin Suc√©: Cheaper ? They bought 30 000$ per slack ü§£
[2024-06-06T23:00:06] El: Of course , you can connect dif devices via CAN bus , but you have to sync 2 motors via dif controllers ...why invent a wheel ?
[2024-06-06T23:02:56] haku: live action pokemon whuuut!

[2024-06-06T23:23:57] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: What do you say just connecting one throttle to 2 vescs and making a switch that cuts throttle as a dual/single button
[2024-06-06T23:28:47] haku: he just took those lime scooters home lol
[2024-06-06T23:42:13] haku: this guy is a legit engineer. wow
[2024-06-06T23:50:40] Noname: A friend in Maine lives near old train tracks he wants to build a quick rail rider. Be funny to make a rail cart out of 2 scooters
[2024-06-06T23:51:04] Noname: Also I got my NIU scooter registered as a moped today
[2024-06-06T23:54:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think you have to check ur source
[2024-06-06T23:55:13] sombre_enfant: 30k is a bit too much... I bet its 3.5x less
[2024-06-06T23:59:40] haku: nice! do you still need insurance?
[2024-06-07T00:09:37] Noname: No but it's 75$
[2024-06-07T00:10:14] Noname: Just in case I bring it to Pennsylvania
[2024-06-07T00:11:00] haku: you are a good citizen my guy. very responsible.
[2024-06-07T00:11:51] haku: of you register as a moped do you get plates?
[2024-06-07T00:12:22] Noname: Ah it's technically a bike in MA but not PA that's unregistered uninsured vehicle but idk about im out of state laws
[2024-06-07T00:13:13] Noname: It's not a stand scooter it's not an ebike and looks like a Vespa with no plate idk
[2024-06-07T00:13:14] haku: now you can put those watercooled sotion motors and not get bothered
[2024-06-07T00:13:49] Noname: Ah can't go over 30 or some shit cause then it's illegal as I need Mcycle registration
[2024-06-07T00:14:13] Noname: Just a huge battery and a Lil bigger controller 35-40 is good
[2024-06-07T00:14:41] Noname: C80 will be the bat shit crazy vehicle
[2024-06-07T00:28:07] NetworkDir: I don't think good idea because with this you dont have a traction control and monitor 2 vescs temp

[2024-06-07T09:12:28] rosheee: Y?
[2024-06-07T09:58:30] Alin Ciobanu: With original battery it improves but not too much
[2024-06-07T11:15:34] heimdler: Not much in terms of performance but what other added features that's useful? I can think of Bluetooth connectivity being one of the perks
[2024-06-07T11:15:56] GABE: Literally everything
[2024-06-07T11:16:20] GABE: It's vesc
[2024-06-07T11:17:07] heimdler: Additional port for lightings?
[2024-06-07T11:17:45] heimdler: I'm new to it, got a vsett 10+ and would like a good doc I could read up up to start!
[2024-06-07T11:17:59] GABE: You could mod the speed. Efficiency up as well No speed limit that lowers efficiency so much more
[2024-06-07T11:18:40] GABE: Add a nice 3s without BMS, and charge with balance charger. Or with BMS, but most 3s BMS are shit
[2024-06-07T11:19:02] GABE: good document to start? just read this entire group
[2024-06-07T11:21:10] heimdler: Yeah was here since last year, maybe I should go back in time further üòÇ

[2024-06-07T12:19:02] heimdler: Sorry read it wrong, 70h?
[2024-06-07T12:19:14] GABE: You need way more amps to push those fuckers than you think hahahahahaha
[2024-06-07T12:19:30] GABE: Also my motors are hybrid so I need more amps to push. Not speed motors.
[2024-06-07T12:19:45] GABE: what exactly are you trying to build yourself?
[2024-06-07T12:20:23] GABE: Possible sure if you find a place to hold cells and speed motor with 12fet

[2024-06-07T12:26:47] heimdler: For now I'm looking to add more functionality rather than performance. Bluetooth is one, for a start
[2024-06-07T12:27:02] heimdler: Are they stock vsett 10+ motors?

[2024-06-07T12:57:42] GABE: Basically ruined a good motor lol
[2024-06-07T12:57:47] GABE: Cause i was lazy

[2024-06-07T15:33:34] Happy Giraffe: If you need lot of power (5000-7000w), buy 85/150. If need even more power, buy 85/250. EasyüëÄ
[2024-06-07T15:40:16] heimdler: I have a vsett 10+
[2024-06-07T15:41:16] heimdler: I'd stick with the 60v battery for now. Besides having Bluetooth connectivity, what else can I add? Front light, skirting led, honk

[2024-06-07T18:24:38] Lisa: @jamessoderstrom is a ubox seller
[2024-06-07T19:07:50] haku: you will be stocking mini right?
[2024-06-07T19:23:58] haku: cool cool!
[2024-06-07T19:25:17] haku: its vent holes. like aircooled
[2024-06-07T19:25:46] haku: theres also watercooled motors wich is nuts
[2024-06-07T19:26:06] GABE: Nitrous oxide cooled better in theory
[2024-06-07T19:26:26] GABE: I call dibs on this.
[2024-06-07T19:26:51] GABE: Arduino injection of N20 every time the motor goes above 80¬∞
[2024-06-07T19:26:55] haku: sure 1 spark and boom
[2024-06-07T19:27:12] GABE: Could use any other cold gas ü§£
[2024-06-07T19:27:22] GABE: Even compressed air, would be better than air cooled
[2024-06-07T19:27:48] haku: aircooled better than no cooled
[2024-06-07T19:27:56] GABE: True cos it's constant
[2024-06-07T19:28:00] GABE: ah ye
[2024-06-07T19:28:15] GABE: Does the motor need cleaning every once in a while?
[2024-06-07T19:28:25] haku: no idea
[2024-06-07T19:28:58] haku: 3 phase motors can be open. like powertools
[2024-06-07T19:29:35] haku: i will put heart shapes on mine and sell it
[2024-06-07T19:33:18] haku: @jamessoderstrom do you know if spintend is not selling dual 100 v2 anymore? i dont see it in the store.
[2024-06-07T19:52:55] GABE: Entire idea of a dual makes no sense
[2024-06-07T19:53:04] GABE: just stupid invention
[2024-06-07T19:54:23] haku: its marketed for e skates
[2024-06-07T19:54:46] haku: it trickled down to kick scooters

[2024-06-07T21:57:26] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-06-07T21:58:17] GABE: I think our scooters have more power to weight
[2024-06-07T21:58:21] GABE: Lulz
[2024-06-07T21:59:10] GABE: Need TESC
[2024-06-07T21:59:19] GABE: TESC XESC VESC ESC
[2024-06-07T21:59:43] GABE: actually they definitely do
[2024-06-07T21:59:43] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-06-07T21:59:57] haku: what i can say about tesla is. they are really fast cars
[2024-06-07T22:01:17] haku: i just dont like the portrait mode display
[2024-06-07T22:05:29] GABE: They low powered lol
[2024-06-07T22:05:45] GABE: The motors are severely undersized and the cells are shit.
[2024-06-07T22:05:58] haku: okay
[2024-06-07T22:05:58] GABE: Would have like 1MW power with P42A's
[2024-06-07T22:06:03] GABE: Still tho
[2024-06-07T22:06:05] GABE: obv good
[2024-06-07T22:06:08] GABE: but like
[2024-06-07T22:06:11] GABE: could engineer better
[2024-06-07T22:06:12] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-06-07T22:06:24] haku: mine has 4680 cells
[2024-06-07T22:08:37] GABE: nobody wants to make better tho
[2024-06-07T22:08:44] GABE: They are the pioneers
[2024-06-07T22:09:06] GABE: BAD worded. They are incredible
[2024-06-07T22:09:10] GABE: but they could be even more incredible
[2024-06-07T22:09:11] haku: new 2024 models will be out soon
[2024-06-07T22:09:49] haku: tesla is taking over las vegas. 1 out of 5 cars is tesla
[2024-06-07T22:13:02] haku: they meant to be commuter cars that happen to be fast. if they made a racecar makes me wonder
[2024-06-07T22:16:17] Noname: And no engine light for O2 sensors but loaner says your shits broke anyway
[2024-06-07T22:18:15] haku: i just chose to test it. i wish i can loan a cybertruck
[2024-06-07T22:24:45] GABE: They need to give Tesla FWK
[2024-06-07T22:25:47] haku: maybe ill use 85100 alu on mine and see if it goes faster
[2024-06-07T22:34:15] GABE: "Warning: Expect range to be down by 50%"
[2024-06-07T22:35:13] Noname: There's a Lil car with a Nuc 24f on YouTube. Can't find it though but it moves pretty good
[2024-06-07T22:37:57] Noname: So thinking, my NIU scooter needs more power. Disconnect wheel/throttle and power with an 85/250 leave power to stock screen and lights. Idk if it would show trouble code. Mabey just plug in some hall sensors to trick it.
[2024-06-07T22:58:54] haku: that giant vesc i forgot the name of it or fardriver nd962600 would be cool for a small car
[2024-06-07T22:59:27] haku: maybe those small chinese cars
[2024-06-07T22:59:43] haku: golf cart sized ones
[2024-06-07T23:00:57] haku: does your motor have halls?
[2024-06-07T23:05:23] NetworkDir: Tesla motors something like PMSM isnt bldc
[2024-06-07T23:05:45] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_15420@07-06-2024_23-05-45.jpg>
[2024-06-07T23:06:00] haku: i dont even know the tech but i praise it
[2024-06-07T23:06:13] NetworkDir: PMSM motors have 6 phase
[2024-06-07T23:06:30] haku: its one hell of a piece of tech
[2024-06-07T23:07:05] NetworkDir: idk vesc can support pmsm or no because i research at forums nothing find about vesc + PMSM motors
[2024-06-07T23:14:56] Franchesco Carofano: Si roche un motor marca all√≠ hermano le logr√© sacar 135.4 km anoche con todo dej√© el curren Max en 170ah cada uno para que se ayuden
[2024-06-07T23:16:49] Noname: It starts from 0 I'd say yes
[2024-06-07T23:17:11] Noname: Actually even rolling backwards a bit
[2024-06-07T23:17:27] haku: then your set. you dont need a display
[2024-06-07T23:19:44] GABE: What the actual fuck, 3 phase already utilizes all 3 wires. 6 phase makes zero sense?
[2024-06-07T23:20:06] GABE: the entire point of 3 phase was that with one more wire more than single phase you can deliver triple the power
[2024-06-07T23:20:09] haku: ask elon why his tech sucksp
[2024-06-07T23:20:51] GABE: I doubt he even knows the formula for AC vrms.
[2024-06-07T23:20:58] GABE: people just do it all for him
[2024-06-07T23:21:05] GABE: Cause he wouldn't do that.
[2024-06-07T23:21:18] GABE: 6 phase is 3 phase and 3 phase
[2024-06-07T23:21:22] haku: he prolly doesnt know how to ride a scooter. that faggot
[2024-06-07T23:21:55] Noname: Ah idk it has one so mabey the plug in speed kit
[2024-06-07T23:22:42] haku: idk what speed kit is.
[2024-06-07T23:22:55] haku: speed kit is a giant esc imo
[2024-06-07T23:23:02] Noname: So
[2024-06-07T23:23:17] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_15421@07-06-2024_23-23-17.jpg>
[2024-06-07T23:23:23] Noname: Speed unlocked stock controller kit thingy
[2024-06-07T23:24:03] Noname: It's under the front fairing. There's so much room there's an echo
[2024-06-07T23:25:00] haku: i was looking at the bare frame yesterday. pretty spacious.

[2024-06-07T23:40:12] GABE: This makes no sense to me. I'll have to learn about it. Perhaps you would know of a paper I could read?
[2024-06-07T23:41:03] GABE: 3 phase would have the same efficiency as 6 phase because each line carries a phase.... So only 2 phase is inefficient on material. Or am I retarded
[2024-06-07T23:41:59] haku: its a spectrum bud.
[2024-06-07T23:42:07] GABE: True and all.
[2024-06-07T23:45:02] haku: electric formula 1 cars have 6 phases too.
[2024-06-07T23:45:18] haku: i dont understand it
[2024-06-07T23:46:57] Noname: <photos/photo_15423@07-06-2024_23-46-57.jpg>

[2024-06-08T00:18:44] GABE: basically said a bunch of nothing
[2024-06-08T00:18:53] GABE: Like no shit its 60¬∞ apart

[2024-06-08T00:23:18] haku: my tricycle gonna be like this
[2024-06-08T00:33:35] GABE: Maybe papa @jamessoderstrom would know
[2024-06-08T00:36:12] haku: even with extended arms lol https://youtube.com/shorts/G3Ca4WmyiDk?si=29YLC_muTnp4JXcq
[2024-06-08T02:08:34] GABE: Need double the fets to run it
[2024-06-08T02:08:43] GABE: I wonder how fat the fets in the Tesla model s are
[2024-06-08T02:09:44] haku: they do not use mosfets. educate this man @jamessoderstrom
[2024-06-08T02:09:50] GABE: wtf
[2024-06-08T02:10:00] GABE: how else do you turn a source on and off
[2024-06-08T02:10:08] GABE: Won't bother him, I'll read up on it.
[2024-06-08T02:11:03] haku: its called something else. i forgot what it is but similar to mosfets
[2024-06-08T02:11:30] GABE: It's probably just a fat transistor lol
[2024-06-08T02:14:16] haku: LGBT transistors
[2024-06-08T02:14:30] haku: yes thats what its called
[2024-06-08T02:16:02] haku: look it up. not making it up
[2024-06-08T02:21:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: Igbt
[2024-06-08T02:21:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not LGBT hahaha
[2024-06-08T02:27:07] haku: no wonder my search results was weird.
[2024-06-08T05:07:29] Yamal: Well, these motors come like this, with holes to dissipate heat, of course with rain it doesn't come out both through the motors and through the electronics that are very exposed.
[2024-06-08T05:10:25] GABE: yeah so literally a fat fet, but i meant how big are they?
[2024-06-08T05:17:52] haku: they are smaller that regular lbgt transistors.
[2024-06-08T05:18:57] haku: im no tesla expert. i need to find the video
[2024-06-08T05:19:27] haku: is this what a tesla esc looks like. i have no idea what these components are. https://youtube.com/shorts/diNqM0vM6gs?si=9mYOMeqCfmWnHSol
[2024-06-08T05:20:29] GABE: I'm gonna make a Pro 2 for a customer with the g30 motor and 10s6p mh1.
[2024-06-08T05:20:38] GABE: And sell for 300
[2024-06-08T05:20:55] haku: cool.
[2024-06-08T05:20:56] GABE: I can add front and rear sus
[2024-06-08T05:21:09] GABE: too
[2024-06-08T05:21:15] GABE: but more cost obv
[2024-06-08T05:21:39] haku: when are you working on your 70h g30?
[2024-06-08T05:21:49] GABE: Tomorrow. I've finished all my assignments.
[2024-06-08T05:21:52] haku: im really curious how you gonna fit it
[2024-06-08T05:22:01] GABE: I can ride it.
[2024-06-08T05:22:05] GABE: soon
[2024-06-08T05:22:20] haku: cant wait to see
[2024-06-08T05:22:43] haku: 70h fat af
[2024-06-08T05:22:45] GABE: I can just use the old batt I have welded, but I have to put the external in a bag. EZ BUT I have to fix the resistor on the BMS
[2024-06-08T05:22:53] GABE: 8p will power it well for now.
[2024-06-08T05:23:20] GABE: Easy sailing everything else, I believe I'm experienced enough to not fuck more shit.
[2024-06-08T05:23:30] GABE: Will let me get used to high power
[2024-06-08T05:23:30] haku: i mean the motor and your fork situation. battery no problem.
[2024-06-08T05:23:38] GABE: Oh fork
[2024-06-08T05:23:40] GABE: just bolt on lol
[2024-06-08T05:23:44] GABE: What's the issue
[2024-06-08T05:23:46] GABE: drill through
[2024-06-08T05:23:48] GABE: pole through
[2024-06-08T05:23:48] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-06-08T05:24:11] haku: okay cool!
[2024-06-08T05:24:47] haku: you have an 11" 70h how you bolting that?
[2024-06-08T05:25:14] haku: you need some french tech
[2024-06-08T05:25:55] GABE: why so
[2024-06-08T05:26:11] GABE: Front can hold 11" 70h
[2024-06-08T05:26:16] GABE: V1 speedfork
[2024-06-08T05:26:38] haku: rear is what im saying
[2024-06-08T05:26:39] GABE: rear will be v1 too hopefully for shits and giggles
[2024-06-08T05:26:51] haku: you doing dual 70h yea?
[2024-06-08T05:26:54] GABE: Yea
[2024-06-08T05:27:40] haku: yea rear. only way is to get new or extend dropouts
[2024-06-08T05:27:59] haku: i had this idea first remember üòò
[2024-06-08T05:28:26] GABE: Then I may need the v1 for the extra cm
[2024-06-08T05:28:30] GABE: to make a new dropout
[2024-06-08T05:28:37] haku: i dont want to take credit so lets work together for a solution
[2024-06-08T05:28:47] haku: üòú
[2024-06-08T05:28:49] GABE: Hmmm
[2024-06-08T05:29:42] GABE: I'll make it work anyhow. we will see tomorrow what I do first
[2024-06-08T05:30:05] GABE: I can drive around with Ebrake coz I have no brakes
[2024-06-08T05:30:09] GABE: won't be going that fast anyway
[2024-06-08T05:30:29] haku: great! my solution was bolting on different forks. or milling a stainless one
[2024-06-08T05:30:46] GABE: the v1 fork is long
[2024-06-08T05:30:54] GABE: I have a g30 max I'm unsure if it's better than g30 lol
[2024-06-08T05:31:03] GABE: What's the difference even
[2024-06-08T05:31:19] haku: idk. its the same i think
[2024-06-08T05:31:21] Noname: Damn we need a place where we can all live and ride scoots all day
[2024-06-08T05:31:26] GABE: milling is effort and cash
[2024-06-08T05:31:31] Noname: I can weld alum and I have no g30
[2024-06-08T05:31:39] GABE: Have a fast scooter and everywhere is fine
[2024-06-08T05:31:53] Noname: No like all be close
[2024-06-08T05:32:07] Noname: It's mostly EUC here
[2024-06-08T05:32:09] GABE: you can weld alu?
[2024-06-08T05:32:27] haku: murica is that place. if we ride in our lane no one will call us gay
[2024-06-08T05:32:29] Noname: Yeah spool gun mig welder
[2024-06-08T05:32:44] GABE: I really wanna get 100kmh here.
[2024-06-08T05:32:46] Noname: Ah no all the time I just don't care
[2024-06-08T05:32:52] GABE: I'll be satisfied then
[2024-06-08T05:33:24] haku: dual 70h will be badass on a g30. you will have bragging rights
[2024-06-08T05:33:33] GABE: I brag all the time
[2024-06-08T05:33:38] GABE: haha
[2024-06-08T05:33:40] Noname: Can't wait to see it
[2024-06-08T05:34:26] haku: dont let the fire die my boy.
[2024-06-08T05:35:34] Noname: You aren't allowed to say that
[2024-06-08T05:35:41] haku: i want a moped now
[2024-06-08T05:36:03] Noname: This guy just threaded the nub of the axle lol but it works
[2024-06-08T05:36:36] haku: he has 70h same ones i got
[2024-06-08T05:36:53] haku: thick ass ones.
[2024-06-08T05:37:04] Noname: Yeah just thought this was neat approach
[2024-06-08T05:37:07] GABE: I'll be bragging about 20s12p for years
[2024-06-08T05:37:14] GABE: 5kwh lul literally Tesla Powerwall
[2024-06-08T05:37:16] Noname: If you live
[2024-06-08T05:37:25] GABE: on G30 of course I know everyone has bigger nowadays
[2024-06-08T05:37:37] haku: that would be legit bragging rights
[2024-06-08T05:37:47] Noname: Why stop at 70h then
[2024-06-08T05:37:53] Noname: Dual 90's
[2024-06-08T05:38:22] haku: lol imagine on a g30. ridicolous haha
[2024-06-08T05:38:25] GABE: Meh its not really exponential at that point, 180kmh or so is already peak usability
[2024-06-08T05:38:38] Noname: Gonna skip my trip and work on segway
[2024-06-08T05:38:56] GABE: I assumed 70h was oversized lulz
[2024-06-08T05:38:59] haku: ide be proud and ride that badboy with a seat.
[2024-06-08T05:39:09] GABE: Nah same on god

[2024-06-08T06:03:21] heimdler: Thinking of getting one just to start tinkering with the ubox in case I want to replace the stock controller on the vsett 10+
[2024-06-08T06:05:22] haku: this prolly one of my favorite cheap tools. it turns steel into a magnet.
[2024-06-08T06:05:35] haku: very handy
[2024-06-08T06:05:52] heimdler: Noted on that, I have a spare Splach Turbo, vsett 8+ clone
[2024-06-08T06:06:30] heimdler: Either that or I get one for vsett 10+, and learn from there. What do you recommend for vsett 10+ 60v?

[2024-06-09T08:44:14] Yamal: Do you have any screenshots of vesc tool with good numbers of them working?
[2024-06-09T08:45:45] Face de Pin Suc√©: Good numbers ?
[2024-06-09T08:47:11] Yamal: sometimes I think I speak Chinese
[2024-06-09T08:49:28] Yamal: When I say good numbers, I mean what the scooter gives with a full battery and making you sweat, that is, 6//700/800A phase, 34-37kw etc etc
[2024-06-09T08:51:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: I don't use anymore vesc tools to log datas but here is what I have as example
[2024-06-09T08:51:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: <photos/photo_15435@09-06-2024_08-51-54.jpg>
[2024-06-09T08:52:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: We separate both motors current, but you can do the addition
[2024-06-09T08:54:13] Yamal: that is what I meant! beautiful numbers! but here the truth is Vedder with his vesctool!!! The rest can be modified!üòÇ
[2024-06-09T08:55:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: Here you have old V3 (more than a year installed in this racing scooter) with 70H motors and small 20S8P battery
[2024-06-09T08:55:10] Yamal: just kidding, it's just that I love vesc tool and their time clocks
[2024-06-09T08:55:51] Yamal: Only 8püëç
[2024-06-09T08:55:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: No, the reality is that vesc tool logs all the small peaks that are invisible
[2024-06-09T08:56:08] Yamal: Nami?
[2024-06-09T08:56:16] Face de Pin Suc√©: We always get smaller power values with smartdisplay than with vesc tool, that's why we no using vesc tool to log
[2024-06-09T08:56:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: Thunder, this one : https://www.instagram.com/p/C1PS76bMFDK/?igsh=MXYxbjN2OWVlZmE1

[2024-06-09T09:01:28] Face de Pin Suc√©: He disassembled his scooter recently, I don't remember why exactly
[2024-06-09T09:01:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: But he's currently running our Motor + C700 and 22S9P P45B on his Sur-Ron
[2024-06-09T09:03:32] Yamal: differences between 70/75h? Is it really worth having to space your arms? And since you're doing it, why not 80 h, which would be the same?
[2024-06-09T09:04:36] Yamal: Is it possible that you have read by hay that 70h have more kv than 75?
[2024-06-09T09:05:28] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's mainly torque and speed 70H more speed 75H more torque
[2024-06-09T09:05:40] Face de Pin Suc√©: 80H is even more torque but not recommended under 22S
[2024-06-09T09:07:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: But remember I always talk in racing conditions
[2024-06-09T09:08:19] Face de Pin Suc√©: If you want to be top competitive in current track circuits in France/Spain, you need 80H motors with 22S or 75H
[2024-06-09T09:11:25] Yamal: I was surprised to read that the 70h gave more kv than the 75h, since these were larger. When do you have the next race?

[2024-06-09T12:40:40] Happy Giraffe: Also the quality of life like ease of tire change etc. Split rim so nice

[2024-06-10T04:39:09] purp: anyone know of drop in aftermarket motors that fit the nami klima?
[2024-06-10T04:39:20] purp: i want to 72v and run vesc on it
[2024-06-10T04:39:35] purp: yessir! i got two burn e max frames too
[2024-06-10T04:39:45] purp: but i need a smaller commuter for college
[2024-06-10T04:40:02] purp: 10‚Äù for the klima. 11‚Äù wont fit
[2024-06-10T04:40:11] purp: i‚Äôll measure tho
[2024-06-10T04:40:35] purp: klima stock runs 10‚Äù 3.5 wide wires but the burn e max 2 runs 11‚Äù
[2024-06-10T04:41:03] purp: i have a extra 11in motor i can test to see tho but even if it fits i‚Äôm pretty sure a 11‚Äù tire would rub the suspension
[2024-06-10T04:41:18] purp: it‚Äôs for a wolf king gt tho lol
[2024-06-10T04:41:57] purp: oh wordddd????? ima test it. i have old nami burn e max suspension i can put to check
[2024-06-10T04:42:51] purp: in case they don‚Äôt fit. are you aware of any drop in 10‚Äùmotors that would fit? i‚Äôm lookin for high torque motors to climb bay area hills lol
[2024-06-10T05:45:46] rosheee: yaes
[2024-06-10T05:46:01] rosheee: u closed app on phone?
[2024-06-10T06:02:06] purp: ayyy awesome! do you mean the stock klima wide motor? if so how much more power do u think they could take? would you recommend adding a temp sensor? which type of temp sensor works best with vesc?
[2024-06-10T06:56:51] Yamal: This yes ‚¨áÔ∏è

[2024-06-10T07:18:41] Yamal: hey Jon t, I can see that you have changed the front part of your nami, share a photo please so we can see the change, by the way have you put vesc on your viper? greetings
[2024-06-10T07:27:24] Yamal: by the way the Klima is a nice scooter, but I have always said that the system of how it carries its battery is a bit of a problem when it comes to updating it or making it with higher voltage, etc.. :(
[2024-06-10T07:29:39] purp: i don‚Äôt have any pics atm other than that one. had to clear storage lol. when i take it out next i‚Äôll take some pics. i haven‚Äôt changed it to vesc yet but i plan on doing a 96v one in the future. trying to build a smaller high torque commuter (the klima) first
[2024-06-10T07:32:00] purp: i live in a small city so for what i will be using it for the range is more than enough. im planing to do a 72v25ah pack in the same area so it‚Äôll be the same 1800wh but i want to push more power for higher speed wheelies lol
[2024-06-10T07:32:53] Yamal: Well, about 85/150 would look good in that container box for the climate controllers, I think...
[2024-06-10T07:33:47] Yamal: <photos/photo_15452@10-06-2024_07-33-47.jpg>
[2024-06-10T07:34:06] purp: right now i‚Äôm trying to find aftermarket motors to run higher power unless the stock motors can handle a lot of
[2024-06-10T07:34:40] purp: yeah i was thinking something like that would work well or a ubox or flipsky 75100 dual
[2024-06-10T07:35:06] rosheee: where ya from?

[2024-06-10T09:19:24] Mirono escooters: The files r public in g30 group lol
[2024-06-10T09:19:34] puneDir: Create a lisp code instead
[2024-06-10T09:19:41] puneDir: This doesnt sounds like a good idea
[2024-06-10T09:19:48] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Why ?
[2024-06-10T09:20:14] puneDir: Long explanation
[2024-06-10T09:20:19] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Not in that level (don't know coding)
[2024-06-10T09:20:22] puneDir: +lisp is easier
[2024-06-10T09:20:28] puneDir: Hmm
[2024-06-10T09:20:39] puneDir: But why would u use single?
[2024-06-10T09:21:20] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Sometimes u don't want to spin out
[2024-06-10T09:21:39] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I have the adc v3 module
[2024-06-10T09:22:18] NetworkDir: You should just connect button
[2024-06-10T09:22:52] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: But if I use the the single/dual button I can't use can it just multiplay the uart input for 2vescs

[2024-06-10T09:24:08] NetworkDir: Sure for what you need canbus? Display?
[2024-06-10T09:25:26] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Traction control
[2024-06-10T09:25:51] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Communication is off if not can bus
[2024-06-10T09:27:04] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Using an ardouino?
[2024-06-10T09:28:48] NetworkDir: Ah i understand @jamessoderstrom he can't use traction control with adc3 module ?

[2024-06-10T09:30:32] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I can't because it makes the vescs work standalone
[2024-06-10T09:30:38] Yamal: Hello people, is this available to turn the controllers on and off separately?
[2024-06-10T09:59:45] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: What do you say to just add an anti spark switch to front vesc ?

[2024-06-10T14:20:44] Happy Giraffe: Those things are nothing special in a way, all their features existed before but whats nice is they packed it all into one unit
[2024-06-10T15:08:57] Happy Giraffe: Two 85/150 Ubox, forget Flipsky they are unreliable piece of crap
[2024-06-10T15:10:36] Yamal: Why never talk about Trampa vesc?
[2024-06-10T15:10:47] Happy Giraffe: This ubox also has great cooling, pushing 6kw I never got it above 32¬∞c even in summer lol
[2024-06-10T15:11:12] Happy Giraffe: Needs to be bolted with thermal paste to scooter body/some alu sheet tho
[2024-06-10T15:11:40] Happy Giraffe: Too expensive when offering same as a 130‚Ç¨ spintend

[2024-06-10T19:44:56] JPPL: Put on the side or around little cilinders
[2024-06-10T19:45:46] JPPL: Other way is to pick some heat shrink little tube and full fill the little cylinders

[2024-06-10T19:47:13] JPPL: Yes for exemple
[2024-06-10T19:47:47] JPPL: And that occurs because (maybe) you don't attach with screws that top part that fits there
[2024-06-10T19:48:24] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Attached with 4 (stock use 2)
[2024-06-10T19:48:30] JPPL: <photos/photo_15463@10-06-2024_19-48-30.jpg>
[2024-06-10T19:48:47] JPPL: Red are screws to attach top part also
[2024-06-10T19:48:52] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Maybe the ring is also moving so locktite is answer
[2024-06-10T19:49:05] JPPL: Ok perfeck
[2024-06-10T19:49:19] JPPL: That is old model ring, but everything well mounted should be ok
[2024-06-10T19:49:28] JPPL: But yes sometimes need extra metal üòÇ

[2024-06-10T20:18:58] Finn: Also try to cut through the mcu so you can overclock it. More speed
[2024-06-10T21:21:13] haku: no shit. true with all electronics.
[2024-06-10T21:22:30] haku: only tesla retains value when it comes to electronics unfortunately
[2024-06-10T21:23:16] haku: and maybe that honda motocompo because its a collectors item
[2024-06-10T22:25:22] Noname: Motocomp is gas and cool. Motocompacto just sucks
[2024-06-10T22:27:03] haku: motocompacto is great imo.
[2024-06-10T22:27:29] Noname: It's like 300wh battery plastic 6" wheels
[2024-06-10T22:27:42] Noname: And costs 1,000$
[2024-06-10T22:27:53] haku: but the idea of it. engineered by honda
[2024-06-10T22:28:00] Noname: It goes like 12mph
[2024-06-10T22:28:09] Noname: Honda has gone down hill
[2024-06-10T22:28:22] Noname: Someone else at the helm now
[2024-06-10T22:28:49] Noname: It's just a money grab for those who can't get a motocompo
[2024-06-10T22:29:02] haku: i dont know why they do not releaze american electric motos like in china
[2024-06-10T22:29:03] Noname: Well he died

[2024-06-10T22:29:33] Noname: China work for rice
[2024-06-10T22:30:05] haku: i mean they have a new fleet of electric motos but they do not sell to america
[2024-06-10T22:31:29] Noname: Idk the segway C80 can be registered in China but not here. More rules there. But they have cool colors, even the makita drills

[2024-06-10T22:41:53] Noname: Well I ordered controller and tires for the NIU. Don't take financial advise from me.

[2024-06-11T00:14:06] Noname: Well at least 1 plated ride now. If they could figure out how to register stuff I'd do it
[2024-06-11T00:14:52] haku: im sure laws will come soon.
[2024-06-11T00:17:55] Noname: Ah yeah. Cops were like I don't know what to do with you guys go on the bike trail last time. Bike trails around here in Boston anyway were kicking us out.

[2024-06-11T02:11:26] Noname: Kei trucks need to be 20+ yrd old here. Don't need to pass safety standards if old enough.

[2024-06-11T15:45:22] Noname: Canceled mu Niu controller order. Claimed 60-70kmh. Saying only 50kmh with 1500w motor. Can't understand I have a second battery. Can't disable charge/no drive function as my spare battery tries to charge stock. See if I can leave stock controller and have just lights and speedo work. Then add an 85/250 to the mix.
[2024-06-11T16:15:49] haku: why not just use vesc and no display or any moto esc with that new tft display
[2024-06-11T16:17:06] haku: you have so much room to fit the biggest esc
[2024-06-11T16:17:36] Noname: I didn't want to rewire blinkers lights and all that.
[2024-06-11T16:18:01] Noname: Mabey trick it with leaving stock controller just disconnect motor
[2024-06-11T16:18:20] Noname: I want to ride not build.rt now
[2024-06-11T16:18:39] haku: good idea.
[2024-06-11T16:19:43] Noname: Plus a 3rd controller to learn programming. I test tonight and if it works order vesc. I just hate turning on phone to see speed battery.
[2024-06-11T16:26:36] haku: thats the only thing about vesc is the lack of displays.
[2024-06-11T16:27:10] haku: its like its meant to be used in a eskate not any other pev
[2024-06-11T16:28:24] haku: i want to vesc my vsett but dont want to lose the display. idk how to program
[2024-06-11T16:53:13] Lisa: There is a script

[2024-06-11T16:57:16] haku: this is programing no?
[2024-06-11T16:58:46] Lisa: Idk isn‚Äôt it for copy and paste for the display to work? Just paste lisp?
[2024-06-11T16:58:50] Lisa: Or what you mean?
[2024-06-11T16:59:20] haku: idk what all that is tbh. im smooth brain
[2024-06-11T17:00:14] Noname: Like a cheap ass screen with rt data Bluetooth or wired with power button would be amazing
[2024-06-11T17:02:55] Lisa: This is just wiring up the display and paste the script? What more do you need hahaha?

My question is directed For the one about the school controllers, it's just to know if we more or less have a delivery date. Greetings and sorry for my English, I use Google Translate.
[2024-06-12T20:16:24] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: this one that breathes fire
[2024-06-12T21:03:55] sombre_enfant: Oh yeah mazak with smooth X control panel
[2024-06-12T21:05:30] Happy Giraffe: Which ones you have?
[2024-06-12T21:06:08] sombre_enfant: I run on siemens but i killed the machine monday when i was pooping
[2024-06-12T21:06:11] Happy Giraffe: Mazak is nice but weirdly Z axis is - on the other machine inside workpiece and + values on other machineüòÇ
[2024-06-12T21:06:37] sombre_enfant: Thats normal on a lathe u use absolute coordinate
[2024-06-12T21:07:42] Happy Giraffe: I mean we have Mazak 200 and 250 and would be logical if machines operated the same way lol
[2024-06-12T21:08:31] Happy Giraffe: And its running windows 8.1 with 4GB ram and Intel CeleronüòÇ
[2024-06-12T21:08:38] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2024-06-12T21:24:08] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: I also ordered controllers and I still don't have any information on when they arrive or anything, let's see if anyone knows anything, they don't answer private messages or emails.
[2024-06-12T21:25:51] ·èó·èí·èã·èï: @SibClimb Can you tell us how the orders are? I spoke to you privately several times and I have not had any response from you.
[2024-06-12T21:43:03] haku: thats yours?
[2024-06-12T21:44:09] haku: mill me a mini bike frame
[2024-06-12T21:53:41] Noname: Ordered form Spintend? Hella fast shipping from Hong Kong or wherever. Ordered yesterday expected Monday.
[2024-06-12T21:55:30] Noname: Minibike frames are cheap. Just buy one and have the forks welded for drop outs
[2024-06-12T22:00:53] haku: instead of bolt on wheels can i have it made into a dropout
[2024-06-12T22:13:18] Happy Giraffe: Lol, Im working around it but currently dont have extra 200,000‚Ç¨ laying around lol
[2024-06-12T22:13:22] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: 3SHUL C350 V4
[2024-06-12T22:13:49] Happy Giraffe: Hahah, better made from sheets and tubes

[2024-06-12T23:02:46] haku: yes. im a disabled
[2024-06-12T23:03:12] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Sorry bro
[2024-06-12T23:03:39] haku: i still want a small g30 though just so it can fit in my trunk.
[2024-06-12T23:04:24] Yamal: You already had one, right?
[2024-06-12T23:05:00] haku: yes. lol need to work on it. i shouldve bought that 10" motors on sale
[2024-06-12T23:14:47] Noname: Eew weeped conversion

[2024-06-12T23:19:21] haku: this one would fit my parts perfectly
[2024-06-12T23:25:23] Happy Giraffe: That is horrendousüòÇ
[2024-06-12T23:25:49] Happy Giraffe: I wouldnt touch anything more than 63¬∞ steering angle
[2024-06-12T23:27:10] haku: maybe it can be fixed
[2024-06-12T23:27:43] haku: thats why i havent bought it yet. not to many reviews on this
[2024-06-12T23:27:55] Happy Giraffe: Nah, its crap
[2024-06-12T23:28:11] haku: big battery compartment though and cheap
[2024-06-12T23:28:16] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_15498@12-06-2024_23-28-16.jpg>
[2024-06-12T23:28:35] Happy Giraffe: Longer wheelbase needed and proper steering angle
[2024-06-12T23:28:45] haku: agreed.
[2024-06-12T23:29:43] Happy Giraffe: Difference going from regular market mtb to a dh bike is similar. Other you need to have death grip on handlebars to go straight at 60kmh. Other you just chilling 70kmh until road ends and cant accelerate more lol
[2024-06-12T23:30:18] haku: i dont need fast. just fast enough to keep up with traffic
[2024-06-12T23:30:35] Happy Giraffe: I mean if you want to die then this is a good subtle option lol
[2024-06-12T23:31:08] Happy Giraffe: Its a toy for 15kmhüòÅ
[2024-06-12T23:33:32] Rose: Hey there crimeware, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2024-06-12T23:35:17] Noname: @Bradhaku close enough for you?
[2024-06-12T23:35:20] crimeware: This is indeed very fast, not even AliExpress is that fast
[2024-06-12T23:36:31] haku: about 4hr drive one way
[2024-06-12T23:36:40] Noname: Ali is 12 days to me. Last order from Spintend was a day? Faster just the weekend messed it up
[2024-06-12T23:36:56] Noname: I did it to NJ
[2024-06-12T23:37:36] crimeware: I like to shop in AliExpress, there used to be 3 Day Shipping in certain occasions

[2024-06-12T23:50:58] crimeware: Brand new VESC from makerbase ‚òïÔ∏è I am glad I am brain damaged from previous projects that I should always pull on cables before plugging in... Magic smoke is nice & fun but not when you are short on $$$
[2024-06-12T23:52:43] haku: what brand is that
[2024-06-12T23:56:00] crimeware: üòµ‚Äçüí´ i love pepsi

[2024-06-13T00:16:28] BBC: Thats
[2024-06-13T00:16:33] BBC: Quite fast actually
[2024-06-13T00:17:37] JPPL: Can't tell, will try to ask, but seems reshape cable connection and big connectors also, just from looking and feel

[2024-06-13T01:02:16] Unknown: I bought 2x Flipsky 75100 With Aluminum PCB and my battery is 16s6p samsung 50e
[2024-06-13T01:02:46] Unknown: <photos/photo_15501@13-06-2024_01-02-46.jpg>
[2024-06-13T01:03:22] Unknown: What do you recommend
[2024-06-13T01:03:31] Unknown: Battery amps and phase
[2024-06-13T01:03:39] Unknown: It is a dual motor
[2024-06-13T01:03:40] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. The future has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-06-13T01:03:58] NetworkDir: For high discharge and currents i don't recommend SAMSUNG 50E
[2024-06-13T01:04:11] NetworkDir: Better use Molicel-LG-Eve-TenPower
[2024-06-13T01:20:04] haku: battery already built i think. 45-50a per motor is my guess.
[2024-06-13T01:20:46] haku: his bms is 110a
[2024-06-13T01:21:07] Unknown: Yes
[2024-06-13T01:21:55] NetworkDir: Better use 35-40A batt current per motor because continuous current for 6p samsung 50E = 60A
[2024-06-13T01:31:07] haku: china living my dream. https://youtube.com/shorts/KhZHqF4oA8U?si=nQ9Kj8DApaoXulXR
[2024-06-13T08:11:28] Happy Giraffe: We usually dont use it continuous but its better to be cautiousüëç
[2024-06-13T10:23:41] Jonas: Sup guys im currently converting a g30max since i got a lot if parts left but fucked up my 75100 i am not sure which motor would be the best choice (was an spin scooter) so i got these 4:
[2024-06-13T10:23:56] Jonas: <photos/photo_15502@13-06-2024_10-23-56.jpg>
[2024-06-13T10:23:56] Jonas: <photos/photo_15503@13-06-2024_10-23-56.jpg>
[2024-06-13T10:23:56] Jonas: <photos/photo_15504@13-06-2024_10-23-56.jpg>
[2024-06-13T10:23:57] Jonas: <photos/photo_15505@13-06-2024_10-23-57.jpg>
[2024-06-13T10:26:13] Mirono escooters: First one
[2024-06-13T10:26:14] Jonas: One i got for 40 bucks oj ali but never trier it the other 2 are from a voi/bird and the original spin one. Monorim is definitily not bad and light weighted. I will install 15s6p
[2024-06-13T10:26:26] Mirono escooters: Monorim sucks Snsc motor without drum kinda useless
[2024-06-13T10:28:03] Jonas: I just have other dimensions to compare so idk drum break would be easiest since i got the rear suspension installed
[2024-06-13T10:29:03] Jonas: The 75100 made the one with break disc on ~65a
[2024-06-13T10:29:18] Jonas: Monorim i remember 90
[2024-06-13T10:30:02] Jonas: But its actually from xiaomi so making it fir rear will be pain
[2024-06-13T10:32:24] Jonas: So u say the nontubeless tx48v with break disk which is currently installed?
[2024-06-13T10:32:24] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jonas has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-06-13T10:33:55] Mirono escooters: Yeah
[2024-06-13T10:34:08] Mirono escooters: Brake is better then drum (if it's working)
[2024-06-13T10:34:10] Mirono escooters: And it's a better motor
[2024-06-13T10:35:38] Jonas: Ofcourse it is, but i will have ti get a break. Is there another choice then diy or monoshit
[2024-06-13T10:37:10] Mirono escooters: Wdym choice
[2024-06-13T10:38:45] Jonas: Like a set to just install since i mean to remember i saw it for the 30‚Ç¨ suspension on ali but no clue about monorims one. I would prefer avoiding them aswell
[2024-06-13T10:39:26] crimeware: Avoid sharkset for speed.
[2024-06-13T10:40:22] Jonas: Well i made 90kmh on 12inch with my pro2 monorim suspension
[2024-06-13T10:40:39] crimeware: Monorim for front is the only real solution but with roscheees speed fork for the monorim is the best solution afaik
[2024-06-13T10:42:19] Jonas: Yea the one from bird is not bad too since it got 12 inch frontwheel but i put it in rubbish looks shitty and idk why its even legal in Germany
[2024-06-13T10:44:05] Jonas: But no ideas for an aio set for rear monorim? Except monorim i mean? I think i got a xiaomi break left but imo it was fine
[2024-06-13T11:05:11] crimeware: 12 inch?
[2024-06-13T11:05:39] crimeware: You have 3 options for suspension ‚Ä¢ Monorim ‚Ä¢ Dereza ‚Ä¢ Sharkset
[2024-06-13T11:07:07] crimeware: But let's keep the convo to off-topic
[2024-06-13T11:10:39] Jonas: If anybody wants them feel free to pm both mksecs are dead so i think the picture says it all. All components are okay doefrom right one except that... Yeah pcb is broken xd. left one turns on but got fked (idk tbh i thought it would be the first test ride...) if u pay shipping i could arange Sending them. Feel free to pm me. Otherwise i have no use for them will put them in rubbish since my knowledge isnt enough and my repairing skills are just not even close to feeln safe. Thanks for helping out :) and i got like 5 other aluvescs too which have all way worse demage
[2024-06-13T11:14:17] Mirono escooters: Le new 75100 fold edition
[2024-06-13T11:17:21] Yamal: Also there are flispky 350 single no?
[2024-06-13T11:23:17] Jonas: Well if i find somethig i will send it. 2 just exploded on first startup but only flipskys imo mks is way more resistent (i modded for friends too maybe they changed parameters idk so i have a graveyard...)
[2024-06-13T11:28:32] Jonas: <photos/photo_15507@13-06-2024_11-28-32.jpg>
[2024-06-13T11:29:35] Mirono escooters: Uhhh
[2024-06-13T11:30:27] Jonas: Fucking shit barely burned the battery.. was close one luckylini had 3d printed frame and could pull it out
[2024-06-13T11:32:10] Jonas: Im cleaning up i think there could be some others too
[2024-06-13T11:34:25] Jonas: <photos/photo_15508@13-06-2024_11-34-25.jpg>
[2024-06-13T11:35:51] Jonas: First startup out of the box... Was the last one i ordered from them
[2024-06-13T11:36:13] Jonas: Iknow
[2024-06-13T11:40:20] Jonas: But thenfriend who basicslly explained everything passed away so my mission was to learn it by doing and now i can say i succeed fuck the noney thoe was worth every fail :)
[2024-06-13T11:43:50] Jonas: Flipsky didnt replace it mks instantly always even it was my fault so fk flipshitty

[2024-06-13T12:52:47] crimeware: I think I should be a product designer
[2024-06-13T12:54:26] crimeware: Instead of selling the same product with just the options of different cable oriantation... How about I just sell the product with 2 shells one for horizontal & one for vertical so the user has the free option to do what he wishes by just pulling the cables to his desires.
[2024-06-13T12:56:05] Mirono escooters: That's not how it works
[2024-06-13T12:56:13] Mirono escooters: You'd need to resolder it inside to have horizontal or vertical
[2024-06-13T13:13:53] crimeware: You wanna tell me the cable is not flexible?
[2024-06-13T13:14:33] Finn: It is. After soldering the tin flows into the cable making it not flexible
[2024-06-13T13:14:53] Finn: Especially when using awg10
[2024-06-13T13:15:01] crimeware: üôÇ
[2024-06-13T13:15:53] Finn: Basic solderingü§ì
[2024-06-13T13:24:02] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Can you help me please, I'm looking for that on Aliexpress but I can't find it. It's pars to fix tronic250r.
[2024-06-13T13:24:44] Finn: Where exactly are they located
[2024-06-13T13:25:22] Finn: Problem with small parts is, that whats printed on them doesnt represent what part it is, so the factory uses their own numbering of parts
[2024-06-13T13:27:37] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: I will inform you later
[2024-06-13T13:27:49] Finn: Post the infos here
[2024-06-13T13:28:15] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Yeah
[2024-06-13T13:43:51] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: They are not the hall sensors, the technician told me that those that I put above have to be changed, there is a problem with the motorcycle.
[2024-06-13T13:44:31] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Later I will inform you where the component goes.

[2024-06-13T15:29:43] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Came cracked from a second hand seller

[2024-06-13T15:57:26] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: And is it dangerous to keep riding like that till I get new rim ?
[2024-06-13T15:57:27] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Shlomozero10 has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-06-13T16:07:32] cihan: Today seller messaged me about the issue with cargo prices and requested me to cancel my order. I'm out of luck. :(
[2024-06-13T16:08:40] cihan: I bought some salvaged hard drive magnets recently and they're extremely strong. Strongest I've ever played with. Are motor magnets same quality as hard drive magnets?
[2024-06-13T16:13:31] cihan: I think about a scooter with 2 barrels on each side. Those side tubes are extremely suitable to make them a rifle and also hide the rifle. Trigger could be placed on the left handlebar. They'll be aiming at car tires in front.
[2024-06-13T16:15:47] cihan: I feel like I'm the only one placing feet on the deck facing opposite sides, right to the right and left to the left. Almost all people place their feet facing the same direction when riding.

[2024-06-13T18:33:07] crimeware: Just not sure if this should stay like that
[2024-06-13T18:33:27] Lisa: Did you pre solder the Stecker?
[2024-06-13T18:33:49] crimeware: Yes, I just forgot that flux is sometimes the key to success
[2024-06-13T18:42:04] crimeware: My VESC Sparked
[2024-06-13T18:43:57] puneDir: What

[2024-06-13T18:45:03] Finn: Mosfets shorted so quickly?
[2024-06-13T18:45:08] crimeware: Can't be
[2024-06-13T18:45:22] crimeware: Like usb port & battery
[2024-06-13T18:45:24] Finn: Reverse polarity?
[2024-06-13T18:45:43] crimeware: Why the fuck should it spark like whaaat?
[2024-06-13T18:45:45] Finn: Diodes in mosfets short batt+ and - when comnecting reverse
[2024-06-13T18:45:57] crimeware: Red on red, black on black
[2024-06-13T18:47:57] Lisa: Yes is normal?
[2024-06-13T18:48:23] crimeware: When you connect battery to G30 esc, it always sparks when connecting
[2024-06-13T18:48:49] Finn: Aah bruh
[2024-06-13T18:48:56] Finn: Did it spaek only once?
[2024-06-13T18:49:01] crimeware: Twice
[2024-06-13T18:49:17] crimeware: When connecting & then inside of VESC
[2024-06-13T18:49:34] Lisa: Maybe you didn‚Äôt connect it fast enough? But it‚Äôs working?
[2024-06-13T18:49:42] Lisa: Just get xt90 anti spark
[2024-06-13T18:50:03] Finn: Inside?üíÄ

[2024-06-13T19:53:41] Mirono escooters: Atleast its soldered over some part
[2024-06-13T19:53:47] Mirono escooters: Not like some of the vsett motors

[2024-06-13T19:56:27] Finn: High quality lyonne motorüòí
[2024-06-13T19:57:16] Finn: They used zip ties to fix everything. On old design they used some kind of cloth wire. Better for heat
[2024-06-13T20:18:17] crimeware: Spintend kaput
[2024-06-13T20:37:34] crimeware: <photos/photo_15519@13-06-2024_20-37-34.jpg>

[2024-06-13T21:21:50] crimeware: I think I found out why it sparked.
[2024-06-13T21:22:38] crimeware: The chassy was static
[2024-06-13T21:23:00] Finn: Blade motor

[2024-06-13T21:45:55] crimeware: turn off phasew filtering, write to esc, ???
[2024-06-13T21:46:57] crimeware: afaik, I need to turn off Phase Filtering, before I write anything to the ESC is this a glitch from the tool that it's still on?
[2024-06-13T21:53:19] Mirono escooters: Old
[2024-06-13T21:53:34] Finn: yes
[2024-06-13T21:53:40] Finn: had a 800w here with zipties
[2024-06-13T21:53:50] Finn: they got loose and were in the motor

[2024-06-13T22:14:04] Lisa: Not own but yea
[2024-06-13T22:14:30] crimeware: I just wrote in very drunken English. I find it odd, that phasefiltering is still on even while turning it OFF.
[2024-06-13T22:14:42] Lisa: You need to write it
[2024-06-13T22:15:04] crimeware: <photos/photo_15523@13-06-2024_22-15-04.jpg>
[2024-06-13T22:15:28] crimeware: Yes I am aware that the holes are on the TOP. I did that on Purpose.
[2024-06-13T22:15:56] Lisa: For screw down or better heat transfer?
[2024-06-13T22:16:00] Lisa: Or both ü§£?
[2024-06-13T22:16:26] crimeware: I will add thermalpad on the flat side
[2024-06-13T22:16:52] crimeware: Reason why I did it is because I don't need those holes
[2024-06-13T22:17:24] Lisa: This the Esc from stoindl or bought new?
[2024-06-13T22:17:27] Lisa: I don‚Äôt understand?

[2024-06-13T22:34:20] Lisa: You said 7S 12P not 12S7P ü§£üëå
[2024-06-13T22:34:36] crimeware: I might be trolling

[2024-06-13T22:36:17] crimeware: The pre-tinned solder is so useless
[2024-06-13T22:36:39] Lisa: Yes 100%
[2024-06-13T22:36:47] Lisa: This is so hard to get it to flow
[2024-06-13T22:37:00] Lisa: Only when putting a little bit from my soldering stuff in there it flows
[2024-06-13T22:37:18] Lisa: Get 5Mm or something
[2024-06-13T22:37:22] Lisa: Good middle
[2024-06-13T22:37:23] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Arne has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-06-13T22:42:40] Lisa: Many user kill their 75100 because of wrong settings
[2024-06-13T22:42:48] Lisa: My first ride with vesc lasted 4km
[2024-06-13T22:42:50] Lisa: Then dead :(
[2024-06-13T22:43:28] crimeware: Mine nearly killed itself due to static electricity. The solution is 10cent sheet of god damn kepton tape
[2024-06-13T22:44:22] Lisa: Yep hahaha they cheap out on everything :(
[2024-06-13T22:45:01] crimeware: I swear to god, I am very sure that MakerBase is just a subbrand for FlipSky.
[2024-06-13T22:45:46] Lisa: Yep hahaha
[2024-06-13T22:46:04] Lisa: They always copy from eachother
[2024-06-13T22:46:14] Lisa: Firstly Phase filter on flispky then on mks now

[2024-06-14T01:01:19] Noname: Well you ruin it for standing with seat base, then have twitchy steering.
[2024-06-14T01:01:36] Noname: And tiny wheels
[2024-06-14T01:01:36] haku: better than twitchy legs
[2024-06-14T01:02:24] Noname: Leg day = scooter day

[2024-06-14T10:09:36] Finn: They have to do with phase controll bc one per phase
[2024-06-14T10:09:49] Finn: Probably current sensing
[2024-06-14T10:27:54] Thierry: Any cheap alternative to jlcpcb and pcbway to machine aluminium? Unfortunately jlcpcb is much more expensive than before, I don't know why ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2024-06-14T10:37:34] Happy Giraffe: @lBabacar Which 1.2 roughing bits do you use for Duplex and Superduplex? I'm trying the third manufacturer, Walter and Sandvik won't hold an edge lol

[2024-06-14T10:50:15] Happy Giraffe: What kind of piece do you need?ü§î
[2024-06-14T10:50:32] Happy Giraffe: If you live outside EU then not possible
[2024-06-14T10:55:24] Thierry: Thanks but this is not exactly what I was looking for. This cnc seems very cool BTW.
[2024-06-14T10:55:40] Thierry: Small aluminium parts
[2024-06-14T10:56:16] crimeware: Yeah it's 100% DIY
[2024-06-14T11:14:22] sombre_enfant: With diy cnc u cant machine real parts man only pre milled block and do some hole and minor form no real tooling..
[2024-06-14T11:15:06] sombre_enfant: If u have tight tolerance and need to machine 7 serie u cant
[2024-06-14T11:17:00] crimeware: You build a CNC Machine to make a CNC Machine ;) Same shit I did with my 3D Printer to achieve very accurate prints :P
[2024-06-14T11:21:52] Happy Giraffe: Pocket NC small CNC cost like 8k‚Ç¨üòÇ
[2024-06-14T11:22:08] Happy Giraffe: 5 axis tho
[2024-06-14T11:22:27] Happy Giraffe: You live in EU? Maybe I can try to see if we have the needed material here
[2024-06-14T11:23:45] Thierry: Switzerland so outside EU
[2024-06-14T11:25:27] sombre_enfant: Tf is pocket nc ? Cam soft ?
[2024-06-14T11:26:51] sombre_enfant: 5 axis not needed at all if u do only one part just need to think fixturing, but im a lathe guy ez job... When i was in mold i seen hard process
[2024-06-14T11:32:18] Happy Giraffe: https://www.pentamachine.com/all-products/p/pocket-nc-v2-50chb-or-chk
[2024-06-14T11:32:53] Happy Giraffe: Not too bad for shipping, is your part complicated? Have a drawing?
[2024-06-14T11:39:45] Thierry: Yes pretty complicated and with anodizing. Thanks for your proposal but I think that I will place the order to jlcpcb.com. I'm curious to know if someone also note an impotent increase of price.
[2024-06-14T11:40:26] Happy Giraffe: Anodizing is tough haha, out of curiosity I'm interested what kind of parts do people need
[2024-06-14T11:46:20] Thierry: Custom parts for scooter like brake holder, steering damper holder, and so on
[2024-06-14T11:46:33] Thierry: Many parts
[2024-06-14T11:46:49] Happy Giraffe: So it's mostly just milling parts
[2024-06-14T11:46:54] sombre_enfant: Hell nah never buy that shi... If u have a home like roger with 50k u can get one old lathe and mill who have like 10 year left at good accuracy
[2024-06-14T11:47:44] Happy Giraffe: This is perfect for 25m2 apartment haha. I could get accurate manual lathe for 1200‚Ç¨ from schoolüò≥
[2024-06-14T11:52:05] sombre_enfant: Get it if it has metric feed and x z feed also if 4 tool turret and coordinate panel so you can set your tool

[2024-06-14T19:57:33] Noname: Probably
[2024-06-14T19:57:57] Noname: Even the motor I bought had to be built but it was fast still
[2024-06-14T19:58:30] haku: the filament was next day delivery. they had a US warehouse
[2024-06-14T19:59:32] haku: ali is goat. better than amazon and bangood

[2024-06-15T20:03:53] Mirono escooters: Find a old server aluminum or copper cooler. U get em basically free on ebay

[2024-06-15T20:41:51] Noname: 85/250 yeah
[2024-06-15T20:42:12] Noname: Having a day and user manual won't download
[2024-06-15T20:44:09] Noname: Servo seems right
[2024-06-15T20:45:18] Yamal: How are your long routes going? I still follow a motor so I can't go far... the orography here has many steep slopes, and I have to choose to go on a flat surface, although whenever I go out with Nami you are not completely calm, in a way You go at half throttle and whether or not you want to go with an engine disconnected is not ideal either...
[2024-06-15T20:47:30] Noname: Long routes are good. Vsett is champion with Vesc. 75km to charge. Niu nqi moped will be running Vesc today 80km to charge but stock is slow üêå

[2024-06-15T22:36:16] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Received my Makerbase 84100HP today. The quality looks really good, screws were isolated, no glue thermal paste below, easy to disassemble, copper shunts as promised, logic and power stage glued together, but bigger gap between than on the 75100 Alu, but that's the neat part: 8 AWG on a 100A ESC. I hope it's going to work well in reality especially with phase line sampling. Also eh, hopefully it fits. I plan to use it on the front and luckily there is quite some space for the capacitors to go. The PCB itself with connectors is about 2,2cm
[2024-06-15T22:41:39] NetworkDir: Guys i recommend this tovut 90/55-6 really nice road grip also my top-speed/accerlaction very better than older

[2024-06-16T00:30:18] NetworkDir: tire quality shitty
[2024-06-16T00:30:23] NetworkDir: better use cst 10x3

[2024-06-16T00:34:03] NetworkDir: cst 90/65-6 just peace of shit
[2024-06-16T00:34:16] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Maybe for the front I'll get one
[2024-06-16T00:34:36] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: (currently single motr)
[2024-06-16T00:36:37] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: ?
[2024-06-16T00:36:57] NetworkDir: no should "6" rim
[2024-06-16T00:37:19] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: 6.5 would not fit zero10x
[2024-06-16T00:37:21] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: ?
[2024-06-16T00:37:31] NetworkDir: no
[2024-06-16T00:37:49] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: And would 90/65/6 fit mantis10?
[2024-06-16T00:38:20] NetworkDir: yeah if mantis 10 rim = 6 should fit
[2024-06-16T00:38:27] NetworkDir: but i say tovut 90/55-6
[2024-06-16T00:39:53] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Isn't bigger better?
[2024-06-16T00:41:09] NetworkDir: zero 10x rim can split and if you put 65 it's squeshed and looks very shitty
[2024-06-16T00:41:26] NetworkDir: 90/55-6 tovut wider on zero 10x rim
[2024-06-16T00:41:47] NetworkDir: 90/65-6 cst vs 90/55-6 tovut :D
[2024-06-16T00:43:00] JPPL: How it performed on rain? I have tuovt 13 for 7inch motors, and on rain is dangerous, but for 6rim it looks awesome

[2024-06-16T03:24:00] NetworkDir: Supporting CanBUS doens't mean display works without program and codes :D he write & make code itself
[2024-06-16T03:24:46] El: Depending on what data and graphs you want to receive, these ‚Äúsmart displays‚Äù are customized individually
[2024-06-16T03:27:12] El: It's not exactly code )) , ready blocks can easy find in network

[2024-06-16T03:33:01] El: if the guys want relatively large displays, they need to put in a little work, because ‚Äúready-made‚Äù ones only have a digital output, while programmable graphics, etc. Can be adjusted to suit your own needs
[2024-06-16T03:33:59] rosheee: ^^ it boost much more

[2024-06-17T22:21:29] haku: thats why theres no wild crimes here
[2024-06-17T22:21:45] Noname: It causes to much concern from the public. Karen's would flip
[2024-06-17T22:22:20] Noname: Then you have to worry about someone trying to grab it
[2024-06-17T22:22:32] haku: exept that one guy who sniped a bunch of people from ontop of the mirage hotel.
[2024-06-17T22:23:57] haku: and that guy is not from nevada

[2024-06-17T22:48:01] haku: nice
[2024-06-17T22:48:56] Noname: 28p battery technically. 1.17a per cell
[2024-06-17T22:49:11] Noname: Need 2 chargers üò´
[2024-06-17T22:49:59] haku: what charging port and what guage wires?
[2024-06-17T22:55:19] haku: this one e grom looks really spacey too.
[2024-06-17T23:10:06] haku: what is the generic name of adderall? is it D-amphetamine salt combo?
[2024-06-17T23:15:35] GABE: Minimal
[2024-06-17T23:15:52] GABE: only 65/80 cells r rusty
[2024-06-17T23:16:20] GABE: It's 2 amphetamines at once, 25% levoamphetamine and 75% dextroamphetamine.
[2024-06-17T23:16:40] GABE: There is Dexedrine, which is 100% Dextro, which is better Vyvanse is also a Dextro prodrug.
[2024-06-17T23:17:21] haku: what is d-amphetamine salt combo? im just worried one of my fam is taking it
[2024-06-17T23:17:38] GABE: for clarification, levo-methampetamine is used to unblock noses. It's crystal meth, mirrored chemically.
[2024-06-17T23:17:49] GABE: Levo amphetamine is pretty useless.
[2024-06-17T23:18:27] GABE: Dextro amphetamine salt combo?
[2024-06-17T23:18:29] GABE: doesn't exist.
[2024-06-17T23:18:56] GABE: amphetamines are safe if you are meant to take them and take the prescribed dose.
[2024-06-17T23:18:57] Happy Giraffe: 81.25% "only"ü§£
[2024-06-17T23:19:13] GABE: So just fancy name for Dexedrine.
[2024-06-17T23:19:31] GABE: I got hooked on vyvanse, well, took my 30 days worth at once.
[2024-06-17T23:19:34] GABE: I didn't sleep for 3 days
[2024-06-17T23:19:46] haku: thats what the bottle says.
[2024-06-17T23:19:59] GABE: Nonsensical.
[2024-06-17T23:20:17] haku: what compound is this? meth?
[2024-06-17T23:20:31] GABE: Meth is just amphetamine with an affinity for serotonin and dopamine, and passes blood brain barrier faster, Also burns the brains out
[2024-06-17T23:20:45] GABE: No, just straight real amphetamine
[2024-06-17T23:21:12] GABE: Non methylated amphetamines are not neurotoxic.
[2024-06-17T23:21:15] haku: is it what the germans took in ww2? good stuff then
[2024-06-17T23:21:37] GABE: No, Germans took straight meth. Just to clarify, the effects of both are identical. One is just more potent.
[2024-06-17T23:22:24] haku: alright thanks for clarifying boys. no more drug talk. im just worried one of my fam is addicted to these
[2024-06-17T23:22:28] GABE: Amphetamine stops working because it's not neurotoxic. Methamphetamine never stops working. Each hit feels like the first, alot say
[2024-06-17T23:22:41] GABE: It's fucking scary dude. You pay with your brain matter.
[2024-06-17T23:24:29] GABE: Meth is desoxyn, which is prescribed in America for the worst cases of ADHD and that disease that makes you fall blackout asleep during the day
[2024-06-17T23:25:03] GABE: So strong it prevents the brain from shutting down from a disorder
[2024-06-17T23:25:42] haku: ill just give fam good ol coke. less addictive
[2024-06-17T23:25:45] GABE: Oh dude amphetamines are the worst things to get hooked o.
[2024-06-17T23:26:19] GABE: They're hard to get tho, they shouldn't last long for the abuser, especially if they're abusing their own supply
[2024-06-17T23:27:02] NetworkDir: Drugs same to FWK - MPTA On 30H Pro2 Motor xD You get little bit better peformance but fucked up instantly
[2024-06-17T23:27:04] GABE: The thing you have to worry about is them switching to ice.
[2024-06-17T23:27:19] GABE: Which alot of speed addicts turn to. Like oxy addicts turning to heroin
[2024-06-17T23:27:41] NetworkDir: Caffeine best drug
[2024-06-17T23:29:12] NetworkDir: Anyway better talk things about scooter and vesc on Vesc Group not drugs :D

[2024-06-17T23:32:29] GABE: on my own
[2024-06-17T23:32:37] GABE: deadbeat dad and dickhead brother didn't help at all.
[2024-06-17T23:32:42] GABE: fuckers. both fatass slobs aswell.
[2024-06-17T23:36:49] haku: this my addiction baby. i get a rush while completing a lift.
[2024-06-17T23:37:13] GABE: Good habit indeed. I have to get back into lifting...
[2024-06-17T23:37:15] haku: nothing feels better than that
[2024-06-17T23:37:40] GABE: I'm getting a bit slobby, but my muscle hasn't gone.
[2024-06-17T23:38:06] GABE: didn't have much to begin with
[2024-06-17T23:39:01] GABE: a girl asked me out today, which means I definitely gotta start working out... The time of being single is gone
[2024-06-17T23:39:11] GABE: single and carefree
[2024-06-17T23:39:26] haku: round nice muscles is nice but that doesnt mean strong.
[2024-06-17T23:40:00] GABE: I put on some weight. I'm at 155 pounds now or so
[2024-06-17T23:40:07] GABE: 140 pounds or less is victim weight.
[2024-06-17T23:40:17] GABE: Can't even use mass to push down an attacker
[2024-06-17T23:40:37] haku: thats my weightclass when i used to compete. now im 220
[2024-06-17T23:40:41] GABE: haven't been touched once since I put on mass ü§î
[2024-06-17T23:40:54] GABE: Even if it's fat
[2024-06-17T23:41:01] GABE: still makes you look dangerous
[2024-06-17T23:59:34] Noname: Hodge podge of wires rt now but they don't get hot. More splitters than I care to talk about

They are called SEVEN and they will be releasing a couple of controllers soon One is TOLL and 18 mosfets. The other is TOLT and 30 mosfets. Both of these controllers come in 100v, 135v and 150v versions. They have sent me some pictures to share.
[2024-06-18T22:06:10] Mirono escooters: Looking forward to it
[2024-06-18T22:06:47] FOCforever: They name their controllers by the mosfet count. This is the SEVEN 18. It's made on a multi-layer PCB. Under the mosfets are many tiny VIAS to transfer heat to the underside of the board and to the heat sink. There is a daughter board that plugs in on top of the CPU. It contains a VESCexpress and all the I/O connectors. They are working on a few variants of this daughter board and weren't ready for me to show a finished board yet. Same for the CNC machined case...that has yet to be finalized. Silk screaned on the board next to the BATT+ stud is the general specs for each variant. 100v = 750pa peak. 120v = 600pa peak, 150v = 500pa peak.
[2024-06-18T22:07:32] FOCforever: This is the controller next to an iphone 12. It's very small!
[2024-06-18T22:08:08] JPPL: üòç
[2024-06-18T22:09:04] FOCforever: SEVEN is spelled with the second E backwards like this.
[2024-06-18T22:09:39] Mirono escooters: Cooled through pcb, not alu?
[2024-06-18T22:09:51] Mirono escooters: If many Vias so cool
[2024-06-18T22:10:58] FOCforever: This is the SEVEN 30. again 3 voltages and TOLT based.
[2024-06-18T22:12:07] FOCforever: I thought this was amusing on the bottom of the board. This is from a render, but it's on the board too.
[2024-06-18T22:14:48] FOCforever: Again...very compact! Case details are still being worked out so this a 3D print, but you get the idea. I don't know the phase amps for it as it's not silk screaned on the board like it is for the SEVEN 18. At 30 TOLT mosfets...it's a lot!
[2024-06-18T22:15:55] FOCforever: It's 20cm long
[2024-06-18T22:17:24] FOCforever: They are also telling me they aren't jsut doing controllers. They are making a CNC full grip twist throttle complete with bearings and silky smooth operation. They are also making a 400v VESC controller. No pics of those yet.
[2024-06-18T22:18:51] Rose: Hey there Matthew, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-06-18T22:18:56] FOCforever: There's supposedly a few other things coming that you'd want on an EV, but they were careful to not say.
[2024-06-18T22:20:02] FOCforever: They didn't tell me a release date for the SEVEN 18 and 30, but "very soon". both controllers are in the hands of testers now.
[2024-06-18T22:23:42] FOCforever: Tronic has nothing to do with SEVEN, but concurrent with getting permission to showing pics of the 18 and 30, Tronic finally gave me permission to show pics of their X12 controller. I've had one for quite a while now and they haven't wanted me to show the board to the world. That's now changed.
[2024-06-18T22:25:21] Yamal: üò≠
[2024-06-18T22:25:47] FOCforever: So how about some Tronic X12 porn? This is seriously compact controller! The X12 board will fit inside a Tronic 250 shell, but the height doesn't work. Despite that tiny size it's almost double the power of the 250R!
[2024-06-18T22:26:18] Yamal: üò≠
[2024-06-18T22:26:51] FOCforever: People that VESC, know this graph is pretty damned good and that's the phases for the X12.
[2024-06-18T22:27:10] FOCforever: <photos/photo_15595@18-06-2024_22-27-10.jpg>
[2024-06-18T22:27:26] FOCforever: <photos/photo_15596@18-06-2024_22-27-26.jpg>
[2024-06-18T22:28:30] Yamal: vesc data tool?
[2024-06-18T22:28:44] FOCforever: The boards are colored, blue, red and violet to indicate voltage. Mine is violet...aka 150v.
[2024-06-18T22:28:56] Yamal: üò≠
[2024-06-18T22:29:39] FOCforever: You get 3 6 awg phase wires with it that you bolt to the phase copper tabs.
[2024-06-18T22:31:42] FOCforever: The small connectors are almost an exact duplicate of the 250/250R except that the COMM connector now includes ADC3. You get an ESP32/VESCexpress on board. Anyone that has seen the 250R, will know they they have 5 electrolytic caps. The X12 has 11.
[2024-06-18T22:32:22] FOCforever: <photos/photo_15598@18-06-2024_22-32-22.jpg>

[2024-06-18T22:32:59] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. FOCforever has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-06-18T22:33:05] Yamal: ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüò≠
[2024-06-18T22:34:00] Yamal: It would really be nice to see them working and leaving data in vesctool, very new and very unknown!
[2024-06-18T22:36:36] FOCforever: X12 is seeing use in Rion scooters for a good while now...that's the red board or 24S version.
[2024-06-18T22:36:59] Yamal: I know man üëç
[2024-06-18T22:36:59] FOCforever: Blue is 100v.
[2024-06-18T22:37:26] FOCforever: The only real difference between the 3 variants is the mosfets.
[2024-06-18T22:38:56] FOCforever: Since its all TOLT, there is only one source for them ATM...Infineon. I don't know what one is used off hand, but that would not be hard to determine.
[2024-06-18T22:39:56] FOCforever: Welp...that's about it...
[2024-06-18T22:40:16] FOCforever: So much for "flooding" whatever that is!
[2024-06-18T22:41:18] FOCforever: Not yet...benched it only and I don't have a 32S pack so that's all been at 20S.
[2024-06-18T22:43:22] Yamal: X 12
[2024-06-18T22:43:44] Rose: FOCforever has been approved in Vesc / Scooter group! They will now be ignored by automated admin actions like locks, blocklists, and antiflood.
[2024-06-18T22:44:30] Yamal: The problem is that most people don't like to put down the accelerator and hold on for a while‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
[2024-06-18T22:45:29] FOCforever: Agreed...I don't post crap (i hope).
[2024-06-18T22:46:06] Mirono escooters: Good
[2024-06-18T22:46:14] FOCforever: That's still some good data...20 kw for a 12 fet is about right.
[2024-06-18T22:47:40] Yamal: https://youtu.be/lyuiorHsYFY?si=n1ZNLsqUSaEdbZRz
[2024-06-18T22:48:55] Yamal: he The video is not a spectacle either, but I'm telling you, there is hardly any data with the new x12...
[2024-06-18T22:50:34] FOCforever: Yeah...that will come out in time.
[2024-06-18T22:52:49] FOCforever: The X12 is way better in every way over the older 250 series. Totally different engineer...somebody I really respect and won't name.
[2024-06-18T22:54:50] Yamal: By the way, what do you think of the shaman and his little force?üòÅ
[2024-06-18T22:56:17] FOCforever: Been a while since I paid attention to Shaman. Has he done anything else besides the FOCer?
[2024-06-18T22:56:56] FOCforever: right and this is the Tronic 250/250R...literally the same controller.
[2024-06-18T22:57:40] Yamal: Well, I have no idea but do you think it is exactly the same as the 250 with a different color plate? or could it vary in something...?
[2024-06-18T22:57:53] FOCforever: Caps are an issue on them...not close to enough caps! They get over worked, heat up and fail.
[2024-06-18T22:58:39] FOCforever: PRetty sure the FOCer is the 250. They sure look similar!
[2024-06-18T23:00:03] FOCforever: I guy in Cali sent me his 250R to look over and maybe repair for him. Blown caps and blown mosfets. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[2024-06-18T23:00:13] Yamal: I know I've had a focer for some time now and it's holding up like a champ.
[2024-06-18T23:00:55] FOCforever: I've never seen a FOCer other than in pics, but I have owned a 250 and I can confirm the wire sizes on it.
[2024-06-18T23:01:38] Yamal: They promise 5 to 8 kw per controller and that's what I get...
[2024-06-18T23:02:14] FOCforever: FOCer:
[2024-06-18T23:03:43] FOCforever: 250R2, but that's just 2 of the 250R in the same shell.
[2024-06-18T23:03:50] Yamal: Now we are seeing about 250 working well in Chile, I hope they continue to do well.
[2024-06-18T23:04:11] FOCforever: So I was wrong...not the same and the FOCer has 7 caps, not 5.
[2024-06-18T23:06:52] Yamal: <photos/photo_15605@18-06-2024_23-06-52.jpg>
[2024-06-18T23:07:46] FOCforever: 10kw from the 250 or the FOCer?
[2024-06-18T23:07:52] Yamal: The reading, except for the top speed, is from a controller, that is, it would be more or less double watts peak and A phase.
[2024-06-18T23:08:02] Yamal: 250
[2024-06-18T23:08:44] Yamal: without discharge battery although 2 in parallel and not about 35A fw
[2024-06-18T23:09:22] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Yummy?

[2024-06-18T23:09:59] FOCforever: I'll start doing some real use of the X12 soon enough...be able to psot data on it more than a super tidy phase graph.
[2024-06-18T23:10:01] Yamal: 100A battery/160A phase
[2024-06-18T23:10:11] haku: looks good. ill eat it if its meat
[2024-06-18T23:10:25] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Fish üê†üê†üê†
[2024-06-18T23:10:51] haku: much better.
[2024-06-18T23:11:39] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Shabat fish in Tuesday
[2024-06-18T23:12:40] haku: fish good source of omega fats. specially raw üòÅ
[2024-06-18T23:13:36] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I made sure it wasn't raw I made for me and bro
[2024-06-18T23:13:58] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Goodnight
[2024-06-18T23:14:06] haku: night night buddy
[2024-06-18T23:20:38] FOCforever: 250 and 250R are pretty similar to the FOCer, but not identical. They both use 6 TO-247 mosfets, but there's lots of differences now that I'm looking at them side by side.
[2024-06-18T23:21:21] FOCforever: I can't believe I don't have any pics of the 250 or 250R!
[2024-06-18T23:21:57] rosheee: sad
[2024-06-18T23:21:59] rosheee: i have
[2024-06-18T23:22:41] FOCforever: Well the X12 destroys the 250 and 250R in every way and the price is pretty decent too.
[2024-06-18T23:22:48] rosheee: yes
[2024-06-18T23:23:02] rosheee: it x12 fuckeria than 250/250r
[2024-06-18T23:23:11] rosheee: vesc express
[2024-06-18T23:23:15] rosheee: same size
[2024-06-18T23:23:28] FOCforever: X12 has a built in ESP32, 250/250R do not
[2024-06-18T23:23:33] rosheee: i know ^^'
[2024-06-18T23:23:39] rosheee: it has vesc express in
[2024-06-19T00:06:39] Noname: @Bradhaku found your new ride
[2024-06-19T00:09:01] haku: dam thats actually cool. looks like it can fit moped motors.
[2024-06-19T00:09:44] haku: link papi
[2024-06-19T00:10:52] haku: just make extended swing arms for that thing
[2024-06-19T00:14:54] Rogerio Figueiredo: 10000w
[2024-06-19T00:17:41] Noname: Can't find it was picture in hub motor listing as example
[2024-06-19T00:18:08] Yamal: 1 controller
[2024-06-19T00:18:44] Noname: Actually pretty smart, swing arm pivit is front of frame to lengthen it.
[2024-06-19T00:18:44] Rose: Hey there Flick, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-06-19T00:19:08] Yamal: It does not have a cambus, that is, they are not twinned, the only thing they share is the accelerator
[2024-06-19T03:02:43] rosheee: ^^
[2024-06-19T03:02:57] rosheee: XD pls
[2024-06-19T03:22:55] Rogerio Figueiredo: So 20kw total?
[2024-06-19T03:53:55] rosheee: nyaeh
[2024-06-19T03:54:01] rosheee: vesc app lies a lot

[2024-06-19T04:27:54] Jhonny Nu√±ez: I don't know, it's a nami Burn-e
[2024-06-19T07:01:48] Yamal: So who is telling the truth here?
[2024-06-19T07:04:51] Yamal: Are you telling me that Benjamin's Vesc Tool application does not record the data well or perhaps the data it returns is not reliable?
[2024-06-19T07:19:43] FOCforever: "lie" is probably too strong...more like there is the "VESC way" of measuring things. VESC phase amps and phase amps you might measure with some test gear probably won't match up.
[2024-06-19T07:21:58] Yamal: what do you mean ? What is reality more or less? By the way, where are you from ?
[2024-06-19T07:24:19] Yamal: and good morning first thing!! Let's threaten Vesc and go to sleep with Vesc, this wheel never stops!! How lucky some of you are that Benjamin is not in the group!! If I were there I would make a clean table! XD
[2024-06-19T07:51:50] Face de Pin Suc√©: VESC tool shows peak phase amps that are not really there x)
[2024-06-19T07:52:05] FOCforever: USA. It's not that it's wrong persay...just multiple ways that things can be done that result in different measurements. If it was flat wrong or "lying", controllers would just grenade and that's not the case. Every engineer including BV has to make compromises to get the best results that meet their desired goals as much as possible. Some of these differences between what VESC measures and what some other test equipment might measure are some of those compromises. I've talked to BV once and rather briefly. I guess I'm blessed lol!
[2024-06-19T07:54:11] FOCforever: A VESC engineer I talk to pretty often describes this as "VESC amps" and "real amps".
[2024-06-19T08:01:19] rosheee: yes
[2024-06-19T08:12:21] Yamal: you managed to talk to the genius and artist
[2024-06-19T08:15:04] FOCforever: Our lord and savior...BV. hahahahaha! guess I get to go to EV heaven now!
[2024-06-19T08:16:32] Yamal: What happens? It is very missing! Has he been a father? xd
[2024-06-19T08:17:16] Yamal: The truth is that the guy promotes himself little, he lives rather in the shadows...

[2024-06-19T11:19:44] puneDir: I will install one tomorrƒ±w
[2024-06-19T11:38:59] GABE: I dont think you can do that

[2024-06-19T11:39:21] GABE: they are at 0 cycles. doesn't really matter to me cause I need to buy more anyway so I'd just be helping you out.
[2024-06-19T11:41:17] GABE: what exactly are you trying to make? Double battery sandwich laotie? You tryna take my idea hmmmmmmmm I don't think the frame will even hold that weight with you on it
[2024-06-19T11:43:00] Jan: Shitty steering geometry üëè
[2024-06-19T11:43:14] GABE: He's alive, so I beg to differ
[2024-06-19T11:43:16] Jan: Cant solve it easily, just bandaid it
[2024-06-19T11:43:36] Jan: If you have any wobbles at all, the geometry is shit
[2024-06-19T11:44:14] GABE: oh shit I didnt watch the video
[2024-06-19T11:44:17] GABE: Yeah that's fucked
[2024-06-19T11:44:49] GABE: Geometry sure, In my experience with commercial scooters like kugoo, the wobbles originated from the tubeless tyre being put on wrong from factory
[2024-06-19T11:45:17] GABE: What's bandaid it?
[2024-06-19T11:47:50] Jan: No
[2024-06-19T11:48:00] puneDir: Yes
[2024-06-19T11:48:31] Jan: Bandaid, its not fixing the root cause of the issue, but here it just dampens the problem. The wobble still occur but dampened
[2024-06-19T11:48:43] puneDir: I maded 97 without damper I was not riding the scoot for 20 days so i forget how it was handling
[2024-06-19T11:50:43] Jan: Its mostly shitty steering geometry. Your tire only causes the initial movement (which can always happen, also due to road quality) but an amplification into a wobble is caused by shitty steering geometry
[2024-06-19T11:51:50] Jan: Example: G30 with Speedfork fixes the issue. 130km/h with no wobbles
[2024-06-19T11:53:09] Jan: Its technically not hard to solve the issue but the industry hasnt understood it yet.

[2024-06-19T11:55:05] Yamal: The solution to everything is called: "G30" a shame you can't practically move your feet... ^^'
[2024-06-19T11:55:20] Jan: Has nothing to do with G30

[2024-06-19T11:59:05] GABE: Hot
[2024-06-19T12:10:14] Yamal: So it's better not to just say G30... better to call it a modified G30?
[2024-06-19T12:10:42] Yamal: Because of that rule of three we are not talking about anything..
[2024-06-19T12:10:47] Yamal: XD
[2024-06-19T12:11:20] NetworkDir: Stock g30 without suspension also have a good geometry
[2024-06-19T12:12:06] NetworkDir: I mean better zero 10x and ETC
[2024-06-19T12:13:26] Jan: Still not good
[2024-06-19T12:13:51] Jan: G30 is not picked because of geometry but rather of durability reasons
[2024-06-19T12:14:04] Jan: It is easier to fix geometry than on C-Suspension
[2024-06-19T12:14:18] Jan: C-Sus is nearly impossible to fix steering geometry
[2024-06-19T12:14:47] Mirono escooters: Tru
[2024-06-19T12:14:52] Mirono escooters: Big sad
[2024-06-19T12:15:30] NetworkDir: With bigger and more lbs sus little bit you can have a better trail
[2024-06-19T12:15:37] NetworkDir: Better from stock anyway
[2024-06-19T12:16:54] haku: i can do whatever i want baby.
[2024-06-19T12:18:54] Jan: Sure, just dont die in the process. You wouldnt be the first dying to wobbles on a scooter
[2024-06-19T12:20:03] haku: e moto is the answer to wobbles. proper geometry and big wheels
[2024-06-19T12:25:10] GABE: Wouldn't it not be a pet peeve to know that your pack is mixed?
[2024-06-19T12:25:33] GABE: I sound so racist rn
[2024-06-19T12:25:34] GABE: Lol
[2024-06-19T12:26:27] GABE: Is the G30 dangerous at 130-200kmh?
[2024-06-19T12:26:27] haku: your right need to segregate em.
[2024-06-19T12:26:40] GABE: I can give ya mine for the same price I bought em at.
[2024-06-19T12:26:44] GABE: Literally just sitting there
[2024-06-19T12:26:49] GABE: gotta take the 8P pack apart
[2024-06-19T12:26:57] GABE: It's obsolete now
[2024-06-19T12:26:57] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-06-19T12:27:53] haku: just make the 11" g30 i want to see if someone other than the french can do it.
[2024-06-19T12:28:34] haku: alpha chad viking king!
[2024-06-19T12:29:22] GABE: I already mounted the motor on correctly.
[2024-06-19T12:29:36] GABE: I just need long bolts to finalize it.
[2024-06-19T12:29:39] GABE: And I'm broke rn
[2024-06-19T12:29:41] haku: the rear?
[2024-06-19T12:29:43] GABE: Yes.
[2024-06-19T12:29:56] haku: show photo
[2024-06-19T12:30:11] GABE: damnit, I should've taken a picture before I moved My workshop
[2024-06-19T12:30:44] GABE: I'd have to use the vices to act as bolts for now
[2024-06-19T12:30:46] Jan: Scooters are already long before that dangerous. But for wobbles i would need to try but hardware limitations. Would need a new battery and motor cables
[2024-06-19T12:30:55] GABE: Later, text me about it.
[2024-06-19T12:31:57] GABE: I can be the one to try but I don't wanna die while at it.
[2024-06-19T12:32:02] GABE: I have the hardware for it
[2024-06-19T12:32:25] GABE: If you want you can come here when finished and test deadass
[2024-06-19T12:32:40] Jan: Battery max: 20kW (With different cells 40kW) Controller max: Maybe 30- 40kW Motor max: Maybe 30-40kW (After cable upgrade)
[2024-06-19T12:32:59] GABE: It's screaming for double 20s6p sandwich
[2024-06-19T12:33:27] Jan: Just 1x 20S6P is enough for 40kW
[2024-06-19T12:33:30] GABE: what cells would give 40kw in 6p?
[2024-06-19T12:33:52] GABE: Digga they will drain within 5 min of Riding XD it'll be like a Bugatti at peak horsepower
[2024-06-19T12:34:11] haku: tbh g30 is perfect already with 10" nice and compact. any other bigger scooter i would just get a motorcycle
[2024-06-19T12:34:16] Jan: ü§´
[2024-06-19T12:34:53] GABE: Do double decker battery with the secret cells

[2024-06-19T12:35:00] GABE: sell your soul
[2024-06-19T12:35:01] GABE: for it
[2024-06-19T12:35:16] Jan: The question is more like, what to do with a 35kW G30, sure you can go maybe 150-160kmh but why
[2024-06-19T12:35:40] Jan: I rather build timeless pieces than more and more power
[2024-06-19T12:36:03] Face de Pin Suc√©: Actually none, even considering 80A peak per cells, you can't reach 40KW ;)
[2024-06-19T12:36:04] Jan: THere is always somebody with more and in 3years, your scooters tech is so obsolete that you can throw it away
[2024-06-19T12:36:20] Jan: 100A peak cells
[2024-06-19T12:36:20] puneDir: build e bike
[2024-06-19T12:36:28] puneDir: it will be with you forever
[2024-06-19T12:36:43] puneDir: replace the battery every 7 years
[2024-06-19T12:37:01] GABE: 10y even at 60% cycle.
[2024-06-19T12:37:04] Face de Pin Suc√©: There are none that can handle this current without extreme voltage drop
[2024-06-19T12:37:22] Jan: Probably realistically 35kW on a 20S6P is more realistic
[2024-06-19T12:37:32] Jan: but lets see
[2024-06-19T12:37:33] GABE: Yeah now I'm forced to because haku is gonna trump me.
[2024-06-19T12:37:45] Jan: it doesnt really matter, as more power is not the solution to everything
[2024-06-19T12:38:04] Face de Pin Suc√©: And delivering the power is something too
[2024-06-19T12:38:07] haku: p42 can do 80a if you really want to push it yea?
[2024-06-19T12:38:12] GABE: Peaks only
[2024-06-19T12:38:21] GABE: P45
[2024-06-19T12:38:26] haku: gets hot tho ive read
[2024-06-19T12:38:27] Jan: Its still 50% more than a P42a
[2024-06-19T12:38:38] Face de Pin Suc√©: I don't know much people capable of 35KW on escooters üòè
[2024-06-19T12:38:52] Jan: Next one i build will be 5kW single motor
[2024-06-19T12:38:57] puneDir: Crash on first ride xD
[2024-06-19T12:39:02] Face de Pin Suc√©: Well, it can, but drop voltage to 3V, not really a good idea
[2024-06-19T12:40:08] Jan: G30 ^^ range doesnt matter
[2024-06-19T12:40:23] GABE: Need vents inside scoot.
[2024-06-19T12:40:25] Jan: I would do a 20S5P with 5mm spacer
[2024-06-19T12:40:43] Jan: Still over 25kW
[2024-06-19T12:40:45] puneDir: i have 20s14p üíÄ
[2024-06-19T12:40:53] puneDir: and only 15kw or so
[2024-06-19T12:41:00] puneDir: M26 moment
[2024-06-19T12:41:09] GABE: true but KW/KG
[2024-06-19T12:41:10] Jan: Vents?
[2024-06-19T12:41:17] GABE: To cool cells.
[2024-06-19T12:41:23] GABE: which obvi is stupid
[2024-06-19T12:41:25] GABE: but like possible
[2024-06-19T12:41:33] GABE: if you're a nutjob
[2024-06-19T12:41:53] Jan: You already have moving air
[2024-06-19T12:42:03] Jan: you dont need vents
[2024-06-19T12:42:42] GABE: the absorption rate wouldn't be that good really because it's only on the outside of the cell. Having cold air blast through every single cell separately would be 100x better
[2024-06-19T12:43:06] GABE: no no I mean like make that air go into the cell
[2024-06-19T12:43:07] GABE: spacers
[2024-06-19T12:43:16] Jan: If you need to cool your pack, you are overstressing it, then rather have better cells
[2024-06-19T12:43:22] Jan: or bigger pack
[2024-06-19T12:43:48] GABE: 39kw already possible with 12P p42a at 45a.
[2024-06-19T12:43:59] GABE: But would be nicer to go more.
[2024-06-19T12:44:06] Jan: "One of the biggest traps for smart engineers is optimizing something that shouldn‚Äôt exist"
[2024-06-19T12:44:07] GABE: may heat
[2024-06-19T12:44:25] Jan: Try avoid needing it in the first place
[2024-06-19T12:44:37] Jan: then you dont need to develop the solution
[2024-06-19T12:44:52] haku: ive seen single side welding before. @jamessoderstrom said those are for cooling the other side. maybe good idea

[2024-06-19T13:48:24] Jan: Im not sure about controllers on the sides
[2024-06-19T13:48:27] Mirono escooters: Epic
[2024-06-19T13:48:50] Jan: Wanna fit 2x Spintend 85250
[2024-06-19T13:49:04] Jan: But i think its too wide
[2024-06-19T13:49:22] Jan: Lay flat battery pack maybe?
[2024-06-19T13:50:03] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Waiting for 3d model
[2024-06-19T13:50:22] Thierry: I built one with 2 75100 alu and in finalizing one with 2x spintend 85250
[2024-06-19T13:50:49] Jan: Needs google maps directions arrow in it ^^
[2024-06-19T13:50:55] Thierry: Better on the side than on the bottom in my opinion
[2024-06-19T13:51:10] Thierry: On bottom is too risky in case some water get inside
[2024-06-19T13:51:30] Thierry: I don't know if you ride when it's raining but I do

[2024-06-19T13:52:31] Jan: 76mm without ears
[2024-06-19T13:52:37] Jan: Thats 6mm spacer minimum
[2024-06-19T13:53:24] Thierry: I think I have 5mm
[2024-06-19T13:53:32] Jan: But with new cells could do a 25kW G30 with only 6mm spacer
[2024-06-19T13:53:40] Jan: The cable pain
[2024-06-19T13:53:41] Thierry: I modified the case
[2024-06-19T13:53:43] Jan: XD
[2024-06-19T13:55:11] Thierry: I'm also upgrading my single motor g30 to be 30s3p. Actually single motor is much more convenient for daily use.

[2024-06-19T16:45:46] FOCforever: BV is lot like many very intelligent people. He doesn't have time for average shrubs like me or you. Watch any videos he's done on Youtube and you'll see that his language tends to be rather technical and he rarely explains himself much. Frank has mostly taken over for BV on youtube as he's more of a normally intelligent person. BV is wicked smart compaired to most of us!

[2024-06-19T16:52:42] FOCforever: VESC is a rather small world! I heard from Tronic today after posting on here. The question was asked about the X12 and working on it. I haven't said this anywhere...not sure where that's coming from? Also an illusive connection was made somehow in the fact that I presented pics of the X12 on the heals of showing off what SEVEN is about to release. I was pretty clear that the timing was just coincidence and unrelated.
[2024-06-19T16:54:03] FOCforever: I'll be more careful in the future to make that distinction!
[2024-06-19T16:58:25] Mirono escooters: Problably someone misinterpreted üòÉ
[2024-06-19T17:27:34] Patrick: Non continuously Eve40PL or Molicel P50B or p45b. 40PL can deliver 100A without any cooling for 62Sec until they reach 80 ¬∞C. P45b can deliver it for only 44sec
[2024-06-19T17:30:21] Patrick: Also 40PL stay above 3V with a load of 100A meanwhile p45b are at 2.78V

[2024-06-19T21:53:52] crimeware: with a friend
[2024-06-19T21:59:15] Noname: Do it
[2024-06-19T22:00:27] crimeware: issue ex rental scooter
[2024-06-19T22:00:29] crimeware: so no keys
[2024-06-19T22:00:34] crimeware: and FRAME is questionable to find
[2024-06-19T22:00:43] haku: we will put a giant murikan flag so cars can see me
[2024-06-19T22:02:18] haku: thats cheap. what is it?
[2024-06-19T22:02:27] crimeware: ex rental sharing moped
[2024-06-19T22:02:51] crimeware: it has - VIN NUMBER - No Keys - Unknown how to get it working (According to police)
[2024-06-19T22:03:29] Noname: Would you register? Need to find out how first
[2024-06-19T22:03:39] crimeware: I have an account for police auction
[2024-06-19T22:03:43] crimeware: the Issue is the Frame itself
[2024-06-19T22:03:49] Noname: Why
[2024-06-19T22:03:51] crimeware: if I can't find a replacement frame I am stuck with it
[2024-06-19T22:04:15] Noname: The Vin? Or frame broken
[2024-06-19T22:04:24] crimeware: no no no
[2024-06-19T22:04:32] crimeware: You have to think like that
[2024-06-19T22:04:35] crimeware: imagine you get it working
[2024-06-19T22:04:45] crimeware: a car crashes into you and breaks ur frame
[2024-06-19T22:04:47] crimeware: so what do you do
[2024-06-19T22:04:48] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. crimeware has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-06-19T22:07:20] crimeware: the thing has no access for keys, so I have to find a way to start the god damn scooter or the police will bum bum sex my butt
[2024-06-19T22:07:53] Noname: It's just a switch. Unplug wire harness and use toggle
[2024-06-19T22:08:25] crimeware: German police is a well kind of special breed...

[2024-06-19T22:51:58] Jan: 136kmh at 11kW??
[2024-06-19T22:52:56] Jan: Your are missing at least 7kW for physics to make sense
[2024-06-19T22:54:41] Jan: (Used 7kW @100km/h for the math)
[2024-06-19T23:09:33] GABE: Must be for one esc
[2024-06-19T23:09:40] GABE: ?
[2024-06-19T23:10:53] GABE: dude injecting nitro into his motor
[2024-06-19T23:15:17] Jan: To my understanding it shows both?
[2024-06-19T23:15:32] crimeware: U still online?
[2024-06-19T23:16:12] NetworkDir: Maybe just front tire slipped
[2024-06-19T23:16:35] Jan: Probably
[2024-06-19T23:17:45] NetworkDir: No temp sensor = -80C xD By default active even you don't have a sensor but you can disable from settings.
[2024-06-19T23:21:28] GABE: i Just assumed that reversed+ and - just made it that.
[2024-06-19T23:21:43] GABE: So like 80c I thought
[2024-06-19T23:21:53] GABE: Defo
[2024-06-19T23:52:03] haku: fpv drones do they run on cylindrical cells? or pouches?
[2024-06-19T23:53:21] GABE: LIPO Only.
[2024-06-19T23:53:31] GABE: HV variant also.
[2024-06-19T23:53:45] GABE: Cause lipo is like air
[2024-06-19T23:53:52] haku: ok
[2024-06-19T23:54:02] GABE: Child me tried to do that.
[2024-06-19T23:54:10] GABE: Needless to say it wouldn't fucking fly
[2024-06-19T23:55:18] haku: im talking about the small diy fpv drones.
[2024-06-19T23:56:14] haku: they can carry some weight. like a mortar round. are you sure
[2024-06-19T23:58:29] GABE: Mini fpv drone***
[2024-06-19T23:58:31] GABE: I meant
[2024-06-19T23:58:35] GABE: Cannot
[2024-06-19T23:59:53] GABE: The runtime goes down half when the battery is too fat.
[2024-06-20T00:00:07] haku: im just womdering why theres a shortage of p45 in the US. maybe someones buying it all
[2024-06-20T00:58:22] Noname: Crappy pic, phone mounted on bars but best day of my life. I passed a gas scooter and walked away from him
[2024-06-20T01:02:41] Noname: Slowest overtake in history but I got em
[2024-06-20T01:03:48] haku: 2 stroke moped?
[2024-06-20T02:16:15] Franchesco Carofano: per motor friend per controller 22kw
[2024-06-20T02:18:27] Franchesco Carofano: I don't have bus controllers separately, truly friend, very happy friend.
[2024-06-20T03:27:49] Franchesco Carofano: another test right now is measuring the rear controller
[2024-06-20T03:52:13] FOCforever: Looks like I'll have access to a Rion Apex soon to mess with.

[2024-06-20T04:33:00] Yamal: What's cool, those 70h engines are also helping you, the The day you install a discharge battery it will be the end, but in short, congratulations brother, you have what you were looking for, a faster scooter with more performance than before!‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
[2024-06-20T04:35:15] Yamal: Any photo of the champion?üòÅ

[2024-06-20T05:07:36] Franchesco Carofano: I really liked the sensation, it already has what I was looking for with a battery later on, which I will have made
[2024-06-20T05:08:01] Franchesco Carofano: but with the two that I have they deliver 200ah and it works super well
[2024-06-20T05:09:31] Yamal: How many A FW?
[2024-06-20T05:29:47] rosheee: why FW?
[2024-06-20T06:32:16] Yamal: to gain more top speed
[2024-06-20T06:44:27] Yamal: *22/3
[2024-06-20T07:07:47] Franchesco Carofano: fw 38ah by king driver

[2024-06-20T07:44:38] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: What battery do you have, 20s or 22s
[2024-06-20T09:31:24] Yamal: https://youtu.be/LrnPQPE69XM?si=wBuuRSDH-2EC4-5k
[2024-06-20T09:31:30] Yamal: it's not possible!!!!

[2024-06-20T10:16:39] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: the brake discs that are going to last very little
[2024-06-20T11:34:03] Yamal: Let's see when they put in the high discharge battery how is it... it would be good if they made it longer than 20s
[2024-06-20T11:41:41] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: I'm thinking of making a new one in 22s
[2024-06-20T13:40:29] GABE: @jamessoderstrom I thought I got away with that motor shit but they sent me a letter saying I owe them 70
[2024-06-20T13:40:42] GABE: Like wtf haha what if I don't pay dat shit
[2024-06-20T13:41:06] GABE: I literally can't pay that rn ü§£
[2024-06-20T13:42:37] GABE: I already have the motors here so fuck em for now they're gonna wait.
[2024-06-20T14:51:00] NetworkDir: Inmotion V3 pro Vesc powered coming soon :)
[2024-06-20T14:58:37] Lisa: I wouldn‚Äôt.

[2024-06-20T15:35:42] GABE: Fedex
[2024-06-20T15:35:51] GABE: They sent me an invoice for 67.50
[2024-06-20T15:36:15] GABE: can't pay a dime.
[2024-06-20T15:36:32] GABE: I'm a new adult so I'm unaware
[2024-06-20T15:37:20] Yamal: Be careful to see if they can take you to prison
[2024-06-20T15:40:04] Yamal: Curiously, I owe 15.87 to FEDEX too‚Ä¶;)
[2024-06-20T15:41:14] Yamal: They removed the payment link, now I have to search for a while to find it on their page and pay it too, they are also taxes
[2024-06-20T15:43:56] Yamal: What a shame that BV is not in this group for all these types of doubts.. :(
[2024-06-20T15:44:06] Franchesco Carofano: 20 s de serie de Nami 18650 Panasonic con bms de 100 ah y una extra de 20 s 7p 24 ah pilas 21700 sun powerr bms de 120ah

[2024-06-20T16:15:35] Yamal: Maybe no is vesc‚Ä¶.
[2024-06-20T16:25:10] GABE: it would be my first offense.
[2024-06-20T16:25:20] GABE: I'm clean
[2024-06-20T16:27:04] Yamal: better to pay it all
[2024-06-20T16:28:02] Yamal: If you can't pay instantly, it doesn't matter if it takes a few days.
[2024-06-20T16:35:59] Yamal: By the way, I haven't figured out why you have stopped your project,,?
[2024-06-20T16:41:15] Yamal: With bag I think no?
[2024-06-20T16:43:10] Jan: No space üòÖ
[2024-06-20T16:43:20] Jan: 20S9P is about it
[2024-06-20T16:43:31] Jan: With stembag, but the question is more why
[2024-06-20T16:43:37] Yamal: Maybe he put bag for complete,,
[2024-06-20T16:43:44] Jan: You already get 35kW with 20S6P all internal
[2024-06-20T16:44:21] Yamal: More range ..? More power..? Less battery v drop
[2024-06-20T16:44:43] Yamal: But 9p still nice
[2024-06-20T16:44:58] Yamal: I‚Äôm just 10p..
[2024-06-20T16:45:32] Jan: Even 100+km range, for what?
[2024-06-20T16:45:37] Jan: There is no use case
[2024-06-20T16:47:49] Yamal: Having autonomy is always good!!! And if you like routes, then even better, in short, large batteries, except for weight, are better in everything, right?
[2024-06-20T16:48:43] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Can you put the BMS data so we can see the maximum discharge, I know it won't be correct but to get an idea
[2024-06-20T16:48:51] Happy Giraffe: If you really need more range just get a fast charger, like 15A or so it will fill it quickly for another ride
[2024-06-20T16:49:17] Happy Giraffe: Needs topdog cells tho
[2024-06-20T16:49:51] Yamal: That's the other option! which is also cool and has been talked about a lot in recent months
[2024-06-20T16:51:47] haku: he needs to one up my 40t 10p. but he cant because i already have the goods for 22s22p
[2024-06-20T16:55:24] Yamal: haku the day I see you on your ebike or your laot... with vesc and discharge cells I start to cry
[2024-06-20T16:56:41] haku: next project might be fardriver so i too might cry
[2024-06-20T16:58:23] haku: that be cool but what votol can handle 22s22p
[2024-06-20T16:58:24] Happy Giraffe: Spintend 24 fet alupcb when? With fucking m4 or m5 bolts and not m2.5
[2024-06-20T17:00:32] haku: we will see. might be that ymmotor
[2024-06-20T17:00:47] Happy Giraffe: Made some m41.5x3 threads today so nothing less than that
[2024-06-20T17:02:19] haku: even qs723 can handle that muxh amps i think
[2024-06-20T17:06:24] haku: qs268 is 2k. so thats out of the picture unless there is a sale hehe
[2024-06-20T17:07:04] GABE: Still short on like 700. and owe someone 100.
[2024-06-20T17:07:16] GABE: and owe FedEx 70
[2024-06-20T17:07:21] haku: im trying to buy the best possible stuff on the cheap.
[2024-06-20T17:08:15] haku: noname scored a blessing. i want that
[2024-06-20T17:08:18] GABE: I can build the first half of the 20s12p. I think James can print.
[2024-06-20T17:08:55] GABE: Yeah I'm as hyped as you are
[2024-06-20T17:09:42] GABE: Procrastinating on something so insane
[2024-06-20T17:09:44] GABE: just get it done
[2024-06-20T17:09:57] haku: scary bro. standing on a fast scooter
[2024-06-20T17:10:23] haku: its 70% complete
[2024-06-20T17:11:08] GABE: I didn't tighten the motor into my monorim, and it fell out while driving slowly.
[2024-06-20T17:11:14] GABE: Happened last week
[2024-06-20T17:11:15] haku: true
[2024-06-20T17:11:20] GABE: And I was jetting 50 everywhere just before that shit happened
[2024-06-20T17:11:23] GABE: with no helmet
[2024-06-20T17:11:37] GABE: I'm actually brain-dead
[2024-06-20T17:12:14] haku: its just so cute
[2024-06-20T17:13:32] haku: my motors will bolt on that thing. thats why i consider it. you can fit up to 90h
[2024-06-20T17:13:46] GABE: is 90h like the absolute Max or what
[2024-06-20T17:14:02] GABE: I mean
[2024-06-20T17:14:11] GABE: I didn't even know 90h existed till last week
[2024-06-20T17:14:19] GABE: I thought 75h was it
[2024-06-20T17:14:35] haku: there are car motors wich are thickboys
[2024-06-20T17:15:11] GABE: Theyd be taller tho not wider
[2024-06-20T17:15:18] GABE: the H indicates the width
[2024-06-20T17:15:38] GABE: Different motor type
[2024-06-20T17:15:53] haku: https://youtu.be/AWdmRyVegy4?si=4xNpsPP9w_eOD8cy
[2024-06-20T17:17:10] haku: so stupid but badass haha
[2024-06-20T17:26:19] Happy Giraffe: You live in freedomlandia, why wont you just buy a kawasaki 250cc dirtbike and put QS260 there?
[2024-06-20T17:26:36] Happy Giraffe: Then ez 40kw
[2024-06-20T17:26:58] Yamal: I think that with your laot, with the battery seat that you have, the engines and the unstoppable 85/250 can be a good start and something to have fun with, maybe you will get tired before your laot..
[2024-06-20T17:27:21] haku: qs268 too expensive atm.
[2024-06-20T17:28:25] Happy Giraffe: Save up? Not worth rushing 6months for weak and boring build thenüòÅ
[2024-06-20T17:29:17] GABE: Lmao on the cheap
[2024-06-20T17:29:20] GABE: That's what I thought
[2024-06-20T17:29:22] GABE: and now look where I am
[2024-06-20T17:29:28] Happy Giraffe: Then you have a real moto frame that can do offroad like a champ or road riding being stable with good brakes and design. Not worth it to play with these toys
[2024-06-20T17:29:33] GABE: You're already too deep in, embrace it
[2024-06-20T17:29:58] GABE: 550a tho üëÄ
[2024-06-20T17:30:05] GABE: Idk how much 3 phase that is
[2024-06-20T17:30:08] GABE: like 1000 ?
[2024-06-20T17:31:03] GABE: Shitty as in just regular pmts? which I assume to be too weak for such hp?
[2024-06-20T17:34:49] haku: pmt also doesnt make anything bigger that 11" üò≠
[2024-06-20T17:37:19] haku: but it wont fit a 6.5
[2024-06-20T17:39:54] haku: but safer for potholes
[2024-06-20T17:40:40] Franchesco Carofano: ayo would have to run again to do that brother
[2024-06-20T17:41:20] Franchesco Carofano: Let me be able to run again and I'll get into the BMS application.
[2024-06-20T17:44:32] GABE: oh so 90h is taller and wider, I assumed just wider because of magnet width. So 90h a different class entirely
[2024-06-20T17:44:42] GABE: is there not 12" PMT?
[2024-06-20T17:45:03] GABE: When does it change from 6.5 to 7"?
[2024-06-20T17:45:06] GABE: 80h?
[2024-06-20T17:45:19] GABE: This is so interesting
[2024-06-20T17:46:57] GABE: how much KW can one peak on those??
[2024-06-20T17:47:26] GABE: Cont. being a useless number as you already know, I will not be asking for it.
[2024-06-20T17:48:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: 130H is üòè

[2024-06-20T18:34:55] haku: he should stay with traffic with that speed. this why scooter frowned upon.
[2024-06-20T18:58:24] Yamal: anyway, that stock scooter doesn't run man
[2024-06-20T19:01:15] haku: stock or not. just an ass rider. makes scooter riders look bad.
[2024-06-20T19:13:02] Yamal: You have to arm yourself with courage and go out to the street to teach how to drive and what appropriate behavior is!!
[2024-06-20T19:13:20] Yamal: And more than arming yourself with courage, I would say arming yourself with the scooter.

[2024-06-21T06:41:27] haku: atleast they are on a list with a photo and address.
[2024-06-21T06:41:38] crimeware: You grab someone from the jail & explain him he will have his chance with a sex offender
[2024-06-21T06:42:16] crimeware: If you do it well & explain the jail guy the dirtier & absurd the more freedom he will enjoy in jail.

[2024-06-22T01:26:01] Rose: Hey there Clay, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-06-22T02:07:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Useless, there's no airflow
[2024-06-22T02:55:38] Z P: Hello General Discussion Vesc/Scooter related group ! I am newly joined so please forgive my question(s). I am in the process of a custom build SCNC 2 (rental version of ninebot max with a fixed stem) and have hit a snag in my never ending journey of this build. I am looking for suggestions for a cost effective controller that can handle 84V at 300A continuous without additional cooling. As I read my question it appears to be ridiculous however if an aluminum case is attached to the aluminum chassis of the scooter I believe heat should be dissipated fairly effectively. The current consideration is spintend‚Äôs 85V 250A controller however the cost for a dual motor setup is quite hefty and hence my approaching this vast body of knowledge and experience. Please lend your suggestions and thoughts on the matter.
[2024-06-22T03:00:10] Jan: 2x Spintend 85250 yes, if you want hefty performance, hefty price it is. What you cheap out on you will blow up and buy twice+
[2024-06-22T03:01:45] Franchesco Carofano: good controller friend
[2024-06-22T03:12:52] Z P: Understood. And thank you for the input. Do you have any other suggestions?
[2024-06-22T03:13:21] Z P: Additionally are you part of the JREV builds?
[2024-06-22T03:14:43] Z P: Nvm I see that you are. Would you mind if I added you for direct messages? I have encountered something that I need a second opinion on with the vsett 10 motor
[2024-06-22T03:16:34] Z P: Appreciate the advocacy
[2024-06-22T04:28:37] El: ninebot max on 84V , it means speed ~ 100 km/h , Are you sure of your choice ?

[2024-06-22T10:43:00] Yamal: Well, it would be great if the people in this group shared more of their route escapades, races or circuit training or simple walks around their city, also about updates to the scooters/ebikes, etc., like new lights/colors or what do I know? to be updated. and of course @Vesc!!!!! It is great to share performances with what each one has through the vesc App, because this way we realize what one electronic device and another are capable of... By the way, there are no good or bad scooters, beautiful or ugly, everyone is welcome without exceptions! Here it has been shown that the same Mijia can destroy the largest and most high-end scooter on the market, so I leave nothing there, rider, happy weekend

[2024-06-23T01:20:44] GABE: Ur kidding, itll go that fast??
[2024-06-23T01:20:49] GABE: the 12P 20s?
[2024-06-23T01:20:50] rosheee: what 230
[2024-06-23T01:20:51] rosheee: yes
[2024-06-23T01:20:52] rosheee: yours
[2024-06-23T01:20:53] GABE: but 20s is low voltage??
[2024-06-23T01:21:08] rosheee: how much?
[2024-06-23T01:21:17] GABE: hmm?
[2024-06-23T01:21:27] GABE: uhh 72v??
[2024-06-23T01:21:34] rosheee: yes
[2024-06-23T01:21:42] GABE: i thought it would go like 150 max.....
[2024-06-23T01:21:48] GABE: LOL
[2024-06-23T01:21:58] GABE: damn i need more fucking moneyyyyyyy to finish this
[2024-06-23T01:22:01] GABE: i dont wanna wait 10 fkn weeks
[2024-06-23T01:23:10] rosheee: due to motor kV it should do 160
[2024-06-23T01:23:22] rosheee: ppl say
[2024-06-23T01:23:24] GABE: i shouldve went with 33x2 xd
[2024-06-23T01:23:33] rosheee: yes
[2024-06-23T01:23:38] GABE: tbh im so fucking crazy ill swap that shit out
[2024-06-23T01:23:47] rosheee: jan and me still have a pair of 33x2
[2024-06-23T01:23:47] GABE: that is btw.... way more than enough
[2024-06-23T01:23:49] GABE: way
[2024-06-23T01:23:50] GABE: more
[2024-06-23T01:23:52] GABE: than enough
[2024-06-23T01:23:54] GABE: 100mph
[2024-06-23T01:24:06] rosheee: u want?
[2024-06-23T01:24:09] GABE: sure
[2024-06-23T01:24:11] rosheee: jan has 1 and me
[2024-06-23T01:24:14] rosheee: aha
[2024-06-23T01:24:17] GABE: fugggg
[2024-06-23T01:24:18] rosheee: yah then
[2024-06-23T01:24:23] rosheee: this on 10"
[2024-06-23T01:24:23] GABE: is there 11inch 33x2 tho ya
[2024-06-23T01:24:25] rosheee: yes
[2024-06-23T01:24:42] rosheee: yes
[2024-06-23T01:24:45] rosheee: 33x2
[2024-06-23T01:24:57] El: It's not a scooter, it's a paraglider. That's ridiculous.
[2024-06-23T01:25:12] GABE: someday ill swap out. when i am confident in not killing myself
[2024-06-23T01:25:23] GABE: can you print the double sandwich?
[2024-06-23T01:25:25] NetworkDir: 33x2 how much resistance on vesc detect?
[2024-06-23T01:25:33] NetworkDir: 16x4 something like 35-40mohm
[2024-06-23T01:25:58] GABE: i gotta unclog my nozzle xd
[2024-06-23T01:26:06] GABE: a pin should work
[2024-06-23T01:26:09] GABE: and blowtorch
[2024-06-23T01:26:15] NetworkDir: oh
[2024-06-23T01:26:19] rosheee: yes
[2024-06-23T01:26:24] GABE: perhaps i find a customer for them in the future.
[2024-06-23T01:26:30] GABE: and i sell at a nice price to them.
[2024-06-23T01:26:31] NetworkDir: high motors really have a good torque?
[2024-06-23T01:26:56] NetworkDir: looks high rpm and huge amps can handle high kv motors
[2024-06-23T01:26:57] rosheee: yes when amps like james said
[2024-06-23T01:27:06] NetworkDir: bad ass motors
[2024-06-23T01:27:09] rosheee: 70h -33x2 -> 43kv
[2024-06-23T01:27:17] rosheee: 65h - 44kv
[2024-06-23T01:27:17] rosheee: 11"
[2024-06-23T01:27:26] rosheee: üòÜ10" cables never fucked
[2024-06-23T01:27:37] GABE: i need to switch out those phase cables
[2024-06-23T01:27:39] GABE: theyre pvx
[2024-06-23T01:27:40] GABE: pvc
[2024-06-23T01:27:49] rosheee: Hello, this is a conventional 12awg phase line, usually the safe current is recommended in 50A and within.
[2024-06-23T01:27:49] NetworkDir: with 180-200A phase fucked up instantly
[2024-06-23T01:27:54] rosheee: they said
[2024-06-23T01:27:55] rosheee: XD
[2024-06-23T01:28:01] GABE: oh someone told me pvc. making me paranoid xd
[2024-06-23T01:28:05] GABE: i was gonna change dat shit
[2024-06-23T01:28:08] GABE: waste of lifetime
[2024-06-23T01:28:10] rosheee: pvc never fucked
[2024-06-23T01:28:15] rosheee: <animation>
[2024-06-23T01:28:27] NetworkDir: also problem isn't melting problem is vdrop and power drop
[2024-06-23T01:28:55] NetworkDir: i have a low performance with 60A battery current 180A phase with 50A battery and 130A phase work better
[2024-06-23T01:28:55] GABE: for 10 inch cables?

[2024-06-23T01:29:46] GABE: i think ive seen clips of one.
[2024-06-23T01:29:52] GABE: but deleted immediately due to privacy
[2024-06-23T01:29:56] rosheee: have to search
[2024-06-23T01:29:57] GABE: cause thats record breaking
[2024-06-23T01:30:00] haku: photo of 11" on a g30
[2024-06-23T01:30:01] GABE: and privacy gone
[2024-06-23T01:30:22] NetworkDir: i use something like this with electrical tape xD
[2024-06-23T01:30:32] GABE: Ah fuck i forgot to do it today. omg.
[2024-06-23T01:30:35] GABE: when i wake up
[2024-06-23T01:30:36] GABE: DM MEEEE
[2024-06-23T01:30:42] haku: oki
[2024-06-23T01:30:48] GABE: keep in mind theres no tyre but the space IS THERE
[2024-06-23T01:30:52] GABE: youll see
[2024-06-23T01:30:59] GABE: the dropout mod works
[2024-06-23T01:31:03] GABE: i just havent drilled yet, too scared to. im just using vice clamps atm
[2024-06-23T01:31:13] NetworkDir: 12 awg - 4mm isn't fine for 150A phase ? xD

[2024-06-23T01:31:48] NetworkDir: oh watafuck
[2024-06-23T01:31:49] rosheee: let's go 302
[2024-06-23T01:31:51] GABE: i have the blueprints made.
[2024-06-23T01:31:56] GABE: all measurments
[2024-06-23T01:32:11] GABE: everything works out along with enough clearance
[2024-06-23T01:32:21] NetworkDir: i have a 2-3meter 12awg i should change rear cable it's looks good idea
[2024-06-23T01:32:37] GABE: fault code over voltage xd
[2024-06-23T01:32:49] GABE: would take pic but i smashed my phone
[2024-06-23T01:33:09] rosheee: 10awg
[2024-06-23T01:33:17] rosheee: XD
[2024-06-23T01:33:25] NetworkDir: 10awg i don't think can fit on stock bearings
[2024-06-23T01:33:56] NetworkDir: 6003-2rsh stock bearings for bigger cables they use 6004-2rsh
[2024-06-23T01:34:37] NetworkDir: better send tire photo xDDD
[2024-06-23T01:35:05] rosheee: AH SHIT
[2024-06-23T01:35:20] NetworkDir: 60A battery current - 130A phase 20A FWK on 16x4 50H looks good idea for drag?
[2024-06-23T01:35:50] NetworkDir: xD how you stop motor
[2024-06-23T01:36:24] NetworkDir: disconnecting phase maybe good idea and short phase together hahahaha
[2024-06-23T01:36:44] GABE: <sticker>
[2024-06-23T01:36:59] GABE: tyre photo? you mean angle grinder disc photo
[2024-06-23T01:37:57] Yamal: but that speed on the road to which it translates, or is it simply an error
[2024-06-23T01:38:08] GABE: i put my shoe against my 350w to see if esc will cutoff at high load, and it burned my shoes.
[2024-06-23T01:38:11] NetworkDir: i can't imagine do this 150A fwk on solid tire xDD
[2024-06-23T01:38:24] GABE: theres a hole in my shoe now
[2024-06-23T01:38:32] GABE: oh uhh
[2024-06-23T01:38:33] GABE: i did this
[2024-06-23T01:38:37] GABE: the tyre literally
[2024-06-23T01:38:49] GABE: it literally falls off and the motor goes berserk like its so hard to explain
[2024-06-23T01:38:55] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_15668@23-06-2024_01-38-55.jpg>
[2024-06-23T01:39:08] NetworkDir: result something like this maybe haha
[2024-06-23T01:39:35] GABE: with 250w ximi motor and airless tyre it is unexplainable what happens at high wattage and fwk
[2024-06-23T01:39:43] GABE: and im usually one to explain shit
[2024-06-23T01:39:47] GABE: but this i cannot
[2024-06-23T01:40:13] GABE: clone wheels be like... that cannot be a real ximi wheel..

[2024-06-23T02:39:20] haku: lol just messing with you. it will be a ev channel. with the little knowledge i know

[2024-06-23T03:34:52] Noname: OK don't mess with a running set up. Battery fixed now bucking start idk why it don't like my hall sensors
[2024-06-23T06:32:34] Noname: Ok I fixed it. There's 2 hall cables idk if the 2nd one was correct but put it to the motor cable where I could see it come out with phase wire and it works now.
[2024-06-23T06:35:55] haku: can vesc detect halls now?
[2024-06-23T06:50:28] Noname: Yeah
[2024-06-23T06:50:58] Noname: I ran auto set up and it didn't at first. Chose the other plug and it did
[2024-06-23T06:51:47] Noname: But thay plug was what I started on so idk idk. Can't see in there
[2024-06-23T06:54:07] haku: do you have that tool to check for halls? maybe need new ones
[2024-06-23T06:54:34] Noname: Tool yeah I checked with multimeter
[2024-06-23T06:54:51] Noname: Idk what that other plug is then
[2024-06-23T06:55:16] Noname: My qs has 2 1 flat 1 round pin also
[2024-06-23T06:55:29] haku: you might have 2 sets of halls . its common in moto motors
[2024-06-23T06:55:53] Noname: Yeah but one comes out further down the cable where I can't see.
[2024-06-23T06:56:00] Noname: Mabey it's not a hall
[2024-06-23T06:56:03] Noname: Weird
[2024-06-23T18:49:38] Rose: Hey there –ê—Ä—Ç—ë–º, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-06-23T18:50:23] –ê—Ä—Ç—ë–º: Hello everyone, friends. There is an Inokim OXO scooter on 80100 spintend vesc controllers , there is a gyroscope built into the controllers , is it possible to realize riding on the rear wheel? what is needed for this?
[2024-06-23T18:53:20] El: Just coonect controller to rear wheel )) , question what you're going to gain from this
[2024-06-23T19:02:22] –ê—Ä—Ç—ë–º: <photos/photo_15671@23-06-2024_19-02-22.jpg>
[2024-06-23T19:03:17] –ê—Ä—Ç—ë–º: everything is connected and even raises it from an overabundance of power if you sharply press the accelerator , but you need to hold (help ) for riding on the back wheel .
[2024-06-23T19:07:47] El: Alternatively, install cruise control with minimal delay.

[2024-06-23T20:44:06] puneDir: more power

[2024-06-23T20:45:37] –ê—Ä—Ç—ë–º: this is not exactly what we would like, the built-in gyroscope works perfectly and could help to keep the scooter in an elevated position for a spectacular ride on the rear wheel, by pressing an additional button, for example

[2024-06-23T20:58:24] Yamal: Nice
[2024-06-23T20:58:47] Yamal: https://youtu.be/WzMLtOfAP3Q?si=acTN6w9E7DKizTpK
[2024-06-23T20:58:52] Yamal: Is here..
[2024-06-23T20:59:05] GABE: I only have to drill one set of holes.
[2024-06-23T20:59:18] GABE: Other stock set of dropout holes will be utilized
[2024-06-23T20:59:23] Yamal: it's going to be quite long
[2024-06-23T20:59:35] GABE: Oh, I can grind the frame here to make it shorter.
[2024-06-23T20:59:49] GABE: <photos/photo_15673@23-06-2024_20-59-49.jpg>
[2024-06-23T20:59:52] GABE: Already taken into account
[2024-06-23T20:59:56] GABE: I can go as far as I want. depends what geometry will be best. I wouldn't mind putting a sexy footrest tho. I'm gonna have to Grind metal and weld it to make a sweet rest
[2024-06-23T21:01:49] GABE: problem is then I will have to make another set of holes, and won't be able to utilize the stock dropouts to avoid integrity damage. we will see what happens.
[2024-06-23T21:01:50] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-06-23T21:01:52] 'lekrsu': Amazing. Did you make these arms?
[2024-06-23T21:02:15] Yamal: Don't see what project you are going to get into, you really love that frame..
[2024-06-23T21:05:14] GABE: actually, I can go further and not risk integrity. Those old dropouts will be out of the leverage //mechanical aspect of the frame, so they won't be stressed when I drill new holes as the new stress will transfer there. they could even be sliced. in any case, it will actually increase integrity due to the scooters real frame being shorter. seems like everything is sorting itself out. weird, cause I haven't slept in 48h.
[2024-06-23T21:05:35] Yamal: The truth is that the geometry issue is very important, and now I'm starting to value it more, something I learned in this group, maybe if your rides are at 25/30kmh it's not very important, etc., but if you want to reach speeds higher than 120kmh, yes because the safety issue is already involved...
[2024-06-23T21:05:38] GABE: these are V1 speedfork arms. but v2 would work just as well for rear, infact probably better. this is just a prototype, either V1, v2 or double monoshit will be on the rear. but tbh I don't want "monorim" on this scooter. It would taint it.
[2024-06-23T21:05:57] GABE: correct, that's why I'm not gonna touch this frame until I get some real dude information.
[2024-06-23T21:07:00] GABE: im guessing heavy math will be involved.
[2024-06-23T21:07:30] Yamal: 48 h ?
[2024-06-23T21:07:33] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-06-23T21:07:51] GABE: Went 72h once but need some illegal stuff for that personally
[2024-06-23T21:08:05] Yamal: Valerian infusion is said to relax
[2024-06-23T21:08:58] Yamal: But you don't sleep because you're nervous or something, stop messing around, rest is important.
[2024-06-23T21:11:17] GABE: Spend entire night playing competitive.
[2024-06-23T21:11:22] GABE: True.
[2024-06-23T21:11:26] Yamal: you rest! that everything arrives, right now you are going to go to those 150kmh that you wanted
[2024-06-23T21:18:06] El: gyroscope - just sensor it's can't control, only signal it. The controller can't operate the geroscope.
[2024-06-23T21:28:11] –ê—Ä—Ç—ë–º: is the controller unable to press (programmatically) one button according to the gyroscope readings?
[2024-06-23T21:51:43] Finn: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKCLQXSEKno
[2024-06-23T21:51:50] Finn: 6 mosfets per phase?
[2024-06-23T21:52:03] Finn: what are those boards xD
[2024-06-23T22:11:59] El: No. You need an Arduino and a separate project for this purpose.
[2024-06-23T22:17:40] Rose: Hey there Hen, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-06-23T22:49:30] Yamal: 1000 lumns‚Ä¶.
[2024-06-23T22:55:33] Yamal: <photos/photo_15675@23-06-2024_22-55-33.jpg>
[2024-06-23T23:43:02] Jan: haha i didnt design it for that use case but thats some creative way to install it
[2024-06-23T23:57:33] Lisa: Oh that are speedforks? Wow!
[2024-06-24T00:03:17] GABE: average ximi light
[2024-06-24T00:06:23] Yamal: It's magicshine,,, and I took it because it was the one that was available at the time and for budget too, but I think that to move well at night 3500L minimum...
[2024-06-24T00:08:44] Noname: @Gabzy_x using stock holes doesn't make it stock stress. You have added leverage with extending arms. Also stock arms are connected with motor. Now long spans can buckle sideways mabey.
[2024-06-24T00:12:35] Noname: So I don't always want phone app running for rt data. Simple speed and V is enough sometimes. Anyone have a simple idea to convert hall signal to speed? I can mabey figure out a 555 ic chip and a segment led display for numbers
[2024-06-24T00:15:04] Mirono escooters: Ant had a display wich showed speed through hall signal
[2024-06-24T00:15:09] Mirono escooters: Simple arduino could do it?
[2024-06-24T00:15:23] Mirono escooters: Why not such simple vesc screen project
[2024-06-24T00:17:31] Jan: Was a prototype without brake bracket integration. People have used it only for 11inch builds
[2024-06-24T00:20:49] Noname: I dont know ardrino. It's also possible to use a bike speedo but why not make it complicated
[2024-06-24T00:58:07] haku: very cool!
[2024-06-24T01:00:19] haku: thats nice but if you are getting something that big might aswell get a seated one
[2024-06-24T01:04:34] Noname: 10k$ wtf.
[2024-06-24T01:05:08] haku: <photos/photo_15676@24-06-2024_01-05-08.jpg>
[2024-06-24T01:05:13] haku: superior platform üòú
[2024-06-24T01:08:05] haku: damper might fix it yea? maybe 2 dampers lol
[2024-06-24T01:25:23] Rose: Hey there Mario, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-06-24T01:46:10] Jan: I would rather weld two U-Profiles to the frame then use the forks
[2024-06-24T01:46:49] Jan: You could anglegrind out triangles and bend it outwards and reweld it. Probably the safer axle
[2024-06-24T02:16:58] haku: @Gabzy_x you have a better solution. mine kinda funky
[2024-06-24T02:16:58] haku: <photos/photo_13888@28-03-2024_23-29-11.jpg>
[2024-06-24T02:17:29] haku: but now i rather have a 10" because of portability
[2024-06-24T02:18:38] haku: its good to have one small scoot to fit in your trunk and a big seated one for joy rides
[2024-06-24T02:48:13] Jan: I dont know why everyone trying to fit 11inch motors to the G30 and trying to find solutions. Feels like a problem that shouldnt exist in the first place
[2024-06-24T02:48:47] Jan: 0-100kmh 6sec 140kmh+ is easy possible on 10inch
[2024-06-24T02:49:08] haku: bigger tires and motors. i guess. it kills portability though
[2024-06-24T02:49:18] Jan: Yeah but for what?
[2024-06-24T02:49:24] haku: those 70h motors are heavy af
[2024-06-24T02:49:29] Noname: Everyone without an aluminum welder is trying. I'm here welder sitting in corner
[2024-06-24T02:49:43] haku: my guess is better tire choices
[2024-06-24T02:50:01] Jan: PMT 10x3 e fire is perfect
[2024-06-24T02:50:05] haku: make me a frame worthy of mordor
[2024-06-24T02:50:21] Noname: Anyone have 85/250 user manual download? Spintent isn't working for me
[2024-06-24T02:51:35] haku: i do like your setup. the french did this 70h to go racing at a specific weight im thinking
[2024-06-24T02:51:48] haku: g30 frame is light
[2024-06-24T02:53:12] Noname: Bolt on motors are plenty with a g30. Adding weight and don't have enough room for batterys to power it anyway
[2024-06-24T02:54:06] haku: agreed. external batteries kills the look
[2024-06-24T02:54:28] Noname: Or anyone know how to add cruise control button?
[2024-06-24T02:54:33] haku: maybe when better batteries are available you can use full power of 70h
[2024-06-24T02:55:05] haku: gabe is doing 12p p42 so it should be good
[2024-06-24T02:57:19] haku: ask in general. this is off topic is troll teritory
[2024-06-24T02:57:31] Noname: Well my 140lb vsett with 50h is usable power at what 11kw. G30 like 70% weight and double power is kinda insane unless you know you want that
[2024-06-24T02:58:27] haku: ive never got past 55mph on a scooter. shit gets scary.
[2024-06-24T02:58:49] Noname: Laiote went 55
[2024-06-24T02:59:17] haku: laotie stock speed is 55mph gps.
[2024-06-24T02:59:29] haku: with stock esc.
[2024-06-24T03:00:02] Noname: Should be called liability
[2024-06-24T03:00:34] haku: its a $700 scooter. but caskets are 10k
[2024-06-24T03:01:47] haku: almost bubby. just need to change vsett tires and back to work

[2024-06-24T04:10:52] haku: loving this bike right now
[2024-06-24T04:11:37] haku: clutch when the scooter is broken
[2024-06-24T04:19:27] Noname: Only because it's working otherwise you hate it
[2024-06-24T04:19:46] Noname: It's a tire on a 9. I swapped 2 in 30 min
[2024-06-24T04:23:04] haku: im leading the pack in my group ride.
[2024-06-24T04:23:40] haku: i gots the fastest scooter amd dog in my hood. ebike not so much
[2024-06-24T04:30:28] Z P: Hello vsett general discussion/scooter related group. Could anyone advise me on good phase and sensor replacement for a vsett 10 motor?
[2024-06-24T05:44:38] haku: this motor so cute.
[2024-06-24T05:49:18] FreehandZ: Can a g30 frame with 65h achieve a 6 second 0 to 100?
[2024-06-24T06:29:55] haku: tubed tires can suck a big black cock.
[2024-06-24T06:47:33] Yamal: You need Xiaomi type
[2024-06-24T06:55:25] haku: fixed it.
[2024-06-24T06:56:05] haku: lots of room here if i use an extender. almost as big a g30
[2024-06-24T06:56:59] Yamal: When you put your spintend mini there ..? :)
[2024-06-24T06:58:28] haku: dunno thats for g30 i have other spintends i will use if i mess with this
[2024-06-24T06:59:34] haku: 16s5p 21700 looks possible
[2024-06-24T07:01:27] haku: how bout 500 molicels just weld a box and a seat
[2024-06-24T07:05:08] haku: 2 choices of esc.
[2024-06-24T07:05:08] haku: <photos/photo_15682@24-06-2024_07-05-08.jpg>
[2024-06-24T07:06:53] Yamal: Your really buy the 80/100 or have from before ,,?
[2024-06-24T07:07:27] Yamal: Of course 80/100
[2024-06-24T07:12:17] haku: i had them since last year
[2024-06-24T07:12:42] haku: ill prolly use dual 100 v2 because ill just be using 30a
[2024-06-24T07:13:07] haku: its a tiny motor
[2024-06-24T07:23:43] haku: print this spacer and make some magic baby.
[2024-06-24T07:27:30] Yamal: Just for the controller ? Same battery
[2024-06-24T07:28:09] haku: no ill make a different battery. opening this guy for the first time reignited the flames baby
[2024-06-24T07:29:34] haku: i have a room full of potential dreams baby.
[2024-06-24T07:30:26] Yamal: laotie looks at you from the corner saying: well and I
[2024-06-24T07:31:14] haku: she will get her time in the spotlight. almost done. just scared to ride it tbh
[2024-06-24T07:31:56] haku: 33x2 and 10p 40t what was i thinking
[2024-06-24T07:33:05] haku: she still here. don worry papi.
[2024-06-24T07:33:27] Yamal: Let's see, afraid why? You don't need to put it at 140 km/h the first day, you can drive slowly until you get used to it... the same way you drove it when it arrived from the factory, right?
[2024-06-24T07:34:46] Yamal: with those motors and that battery you can have a great time
[2024-06-24T07:35:30] Yamal: you don't have to go fast to have fun
[2024-06-24T07:35:50] haku: im pretty reckless. as a single parent i need to be alive for my boys
[2024-06-24T07:36:28] haku: need something seated if im going to joy ride
[2024-06-24T07:37:23] Yamal: there will be plenty of seats in Alli for the laotie I think..
[2024-06-24T07:38:33] Yamal: and if you don't add the orange one from ikea... I have the same one in green xD
[2024-06-24T07:39:08] haku: maybe ill just glue that seat onto the laotie
[2024-06-24T07:41:42] Yamal: https://a.aliexpress.com/_EJzxKcn
[2024-06-24T07:42:48] haku: i need a basket for my groceries too
[2024-06-24T07:43:13] haku: the seat and basket combo would be nice
[2024-06-24T07:44:40] haku: 16s5p 50e would be my battery choice for vsett
[2024-06-24T07:45:42] Yamal: https://a.aliexpress.com/_EylMgzh
[2024-06-24T07:45:58] haku: thats the one
[2024-06-24T07:46:27] Yamal: you would be missing the table and the TV
[2024-06-24T07:47:23] haku: i wanted the laotie for burnouts originally.

[2024-06-24T10:26:38] crimeware: Suicide scooter
[2024-06-24T11:12:42] FreehandZ: oh damn ok, is it possible to get even faster? My friend has a 370z that has a 5.5s 0 - 100
[2024-06-24T11:13:01] FreehandZ: and, obviously I eventually intend to race once im fast enough
[2024-06-24T11:15:13] Jonas: Sup lads, got my next mksec but idk if I was too high or I bought just an updated version. My question is: can I run the ble lisp script on it made by zuna? and what are those switches for? Thanks as always ‚ù§Ô∏è. Also I must been high af while ordering since I bought the flipsky nonvesc ESC... Well somebody got experience with that? Windows defender is rotating more than the motor currently does when I try to open up their program xD.
[2024-06-24T11:16:19] NetworkDir: Any 10 inch tire available with +140kmh standard?
[2024-06-24T11:16:59] Jonas: <photos/photo_15688@24-06-2024_11-16-59.jpg>

[2024-06-24T11:18:52] FreehandZ: PMTs are probably the only one I know of
[2024-06-24T11:18:56] FreehandZ: They are belted
[2024-06-24T11:19:18] FreehandZ: Only reason i want 11 inch on g30 is for pmt slicks
[2024-06-24T11:24:15] Jonas: I think I will give this flipsky thing a try on my Pedelec. maybe sending it back is no option because Idgaf I just wanted another 75100...
[2024-06-24T11:24:58] NetworkDir: I don't think perfect in 140kmh
[2024-06-24T11:26:47] FreehandZ: Probably best you can get tho
[2024-06-24T11:26:48] FreehandZ: Afaik
[2024-06-24T11:27:21] NetworkDir: Yeah at all 140kmh for scooter not good xD
[2024-06-24T11:27:43] FreehandZ: Larger tires might be ok at faster speeds
[2024-06-24T11:27:45] FreehandZ: Idk
[2024-06-24T11:44:28] FreehandZ: Also what kind of current is required?
[2024-06-24T12:16:15] rosheee: 0.5 bar xD
[2024-06-24T12:25:33] FreehandZ: Bar?
[2024-06-24T12:25:42] rosheee: Superlow tirepressure
[2024-06-24T12:25:48] FreehandZ: For grip?
[2024-06-24T12:27:45] FreehandZ: I'm assuming with balanced 65h motors and 20s?
[2024-06-24T12:27:52] FreehandZ: I wonder what if torque + 30s
[2024-06-24T12:41:56] GABE: True. Worst case scenario i will have to take this somewhere that welds alu.
[2024-06-24T12:42:13] GABE: to be honest, im so far gone that cost doesnt matter anymore.
[2024-06-24T12:42:53] GABE: my scooter 40kw in theory and only like 3500$ max. thats triple as cheap. also shows how big weped makes their shit when it can all be packed so much smaller
[2024-06-24T12:43:34] haku: get someone to make stainless steel dropouts and bolt it.
[2024-06-24T12:44:19] FreehandZ: You could probably fit 40kw in 40 smth kilos
[2024-06-24T12:44:32] GABE: ne its about 55-70
[2024-06-24T12:44:51] FreehandZ: How much does the gt2 frame weigh?
[2024-06-24T12:45:02] GABE: i mean i have a double battery so that ads hella weight
[2024-06-24T12:45:14] GABE: @roscheeee will know
[2024-06-24T12:45:53] FreehandZ: + 30s7p, + some 30s vescs
[2024-06-24T12:45:58] FreehandZ: And 70h motors maybe
[2024-06-24T12:46:31] FreehandZ: What's the total config
[2024-06-24T12:46:47] GABE: 10s12p bottom 10s12p top
[2024-06-24T12:47:01] GABE: in a giant brick.
[2024-06-24T12:47:03] FreehandZ: Sheesh 240 cells
[2024-06-24T12:47:13] GABE: chonk
[2024-06-24T12:47:18] FreehandZ: Gt2 fits 210+ cells
[2024-06-24T12:47:30] GABE: with me it would probably fit 420
[2024-06-24T12:47:38] GABE: theres always a way
[2024-06-24T12:47:39] GABE: always
[2024-06-24T12:47:45] FreehandZ: Like all internal only
[2024-06-24T12:47:47] GABE: yes.
[2024-06-24T12:47:48] FreehandZ: Not with external bricks
[2024-06-24T12:47:55] FreehandZ: How lol
[2024-06-24T12:48:02] GABE: counts as internal with an extender
[2024-06-24T12:48:05] GABE: still
[2024-06-24T12:48:09] GABE: only bags make shit ugly
[2024-06-24T12:48:44] FreehandZ: Well, without extender
[2024-06-24T12:48:46] FreehandZ: It'll look ugly
[2024-06-24T12:48:51] FreehandZ: Since extender would be on top
[2024-06-24T12:49:03] GABE: Oh shit i forgot those scooters go the other way
[2024-06-24T12:49:04] FreehandZ: Then it wouldn't look nice up the front of the deck where it curves up
[2024-06-24T12:49:06] FreehandZ: Where escs go
[2024-06-24T12:49:21] FreehandZ: Extra tall, good for short people ü§£
[2024-06-24T12:49:43] FreehandZ: Daniels bagooter lol
[2024-06-24T12:56:52] GABE: like one bag is fine but the 3l is too much
[2024-06-24T12:56:58] GABE: 2l looks okayyish

[2024-06-24T20:08:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: Quality of teverun is good honestly
[2024-06-24T20:08:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: My 2018 blade is still alive
[2024-06-24T20:09:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: Specially now that the owner is half of dualtron minimotors

[2024-06-24T20:28:33] Yamal: 4 broken steering screws? Or what happens, do they leave the factory waiting for Sonken to help them?

[2024-06-24T20:33:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: But I'm 100% sure, dualtron cracked more than teverun , anyway I don't think dualtron sucks, I always loved it
[2024-06-24T20:36:12] GABE: this was last weeks tragedy.
[2024-06-24T20:36:23] GABE: damn, i really have no vehicle atm, sucks major balls

[2024-06-24T20:46:11] Yamal: blade/teverun are the same Dualtron has always been alone, now it partnered with teverun
[2024-06-24T20:46:46] haku: what magnet size is this. looks thick
[2024-06-24T20:48:08] Yamal: 60h wolf king gt
[2024-06-24T20:48:47] haku: same motors on gtr?
[2024-06-24T20:49:21] Yamal: No the same
[2024-06-24T20:51:01] Yamal: Come on, I don't know if they deliver more or less the same power, but the new ones from the GTR are very cool, the engine rim comes out completely thunder type, and the ones from the Gt don also type Nami, you take out the stator and magnets would be stuck to the rim

[2024-06-24T21:05:27] Yamal: By the way, now I'm in doubt about the new large teverun, what magnet does it have?
[2024-06-24T21:09:19] crimeware: Magnets
[2024-06-24T21:09:22] crimeware: It has magnets

[2024-06-25T22:07:44] haku: no gas papi
[2024-06-25T22:07:48] Noname: Yes
[2024-06-25T22:07:57] Noname: More moped groups
[2024-06-25T22:08:16] Noname: There's nobody around me with escoot
[2024-06-25T22:08:23] haku: there is a eastcoast moped/ moto group
[2024-06-25T22:10:40] Noname: So think I'm gonna do 140+ miles to abandoned assalyum Thursday. Theses a long stretch between charge. So prob a 3hr charge in one spot. 1hr at a park a bit at a diner for breakfast and find prob another partial. 20mi at 35mph is 1hr charge, it sucks
[2024-06-25T22:11:18] Noname: 2 to 1 ratio
[2024-06-25T22:11:19] haku: nice!
[2024-06-25T22:11:36] haku: you on the niu?
[2024-06-25T22:12:30] haku: like i said someday hyper super fast charge will be available.
[2024-06-25T22:12:33] Noname: Yeah I'd die standing on Vsett. Prob gonna be 12hr ride
[2024-06-25T22:12:47] haku: put a seat on it lol
[2024-06-25T22:12:57] Noname: Nooooooooooooooooooooooo
[2024-06-25T22:13:57] Noname: It's not worth it. It doesn't handle like a cycle it's just a conglomerate of stupid stuff at that point
[2024-06-25T22:14:09] haku: a seat on standing scooters are like fanny packs slung on yoyr shoulder. same energy
[2024-06-25T22:15:31] Noname: Small wheels, crappy brakes, tiny suspension, bad steering geometry, bad aerodynamics. Just buy an emoped
[2024-06-25T22:15:57] Noname: Oh and a seat on a pole that wobbles
[2024-06-25T22:17:20] Noname: I'm lurking in the groups. There's a vespa meet close to me soon
[2024-06-25T22:19:37] haku: make converted gas to electric motos.
[2024-06-25T22:19:54] haku: like that open carry kid
[2024-06-25T22:20:37] haku: you have welding skills too
[2024-06-25T22:24:21] Noname: Higher voltage 10kw battery on NIU and a bigger charger. Start out with 90+ miles range and only have to charge for an hour for a long trip.
[2024-06-25T22:25:25] haku: you shouldve bought those 50e in auction. thats perfect for niu
[2024-06-25T22:25:52] haku: 2.5k cells for 1.5k

[2024-06-25T22:32:47] haku: my room will be the biggest firehazard in the hood haha

[2024-06-25T22:44:03] haku: dam pretty much doubled BH price.

[2024-06-25T22:49:29] haku: slow vsett is a safe ride
[2024-06-25T22:49:45] Noname: So why bother with it
[2024-06-25T22:49:56] haku: i want more range.
[2024-06-25T22:50:23] Noname: So take out stock battery add more then have stock battery on shelf?

[2024-06-25T23:05:59] haku: i would prolly disasemble laotie battery or sell it to get 50e

[2024-06-25T23:52:08] haku: how do i keep it bolted to the frame?
[2024-06-26T00:02:09] NetworkDir: Also you can put controllers outside deck/frame
[2024-06-26T00:05:58] haku: good idea. but if theres space inside rather have it all internal
[2024-06-26T00:06:20] haku: easier to transport. thanks for the stl btw

[2024-06-26T11:45:15] Cengiz Han GEN√áALƒ∞: Aspilsan specs are not fake, it is 13-16mR, the resistance is 18mR even from a battery that has been used for a long time.
[2024-06-26T11:45:38] puneDir: With 25a it reachs 90c
[2024-06-26T11:45:53] puneDir: 15a is fine but 25a is not safe for that
[2024-06-26T11:46:05] puneDir: 18650s shouldnt pass 55c in general
[2024-06-26T11:46:19] NetworkDir: Actually anything available on datasheet
[2024-06-26T11:46:25] Cengiz Han GEN√áALƒ∞: If you pull from M26 to 15a, see what happens.

[2024-06-26T11:48:35] Cengiz Han GEN√áALƒ∞: That battery will leak
[2024-06-26T11:49:57] Cengiz Han GEN√áALƒ∞: If you are constantly drawing 10A, it is flowing.
[2024-06-26T11:49:58] FreehandZ: I just got here what're they're scoots?
[2024-06-26T11:50:08] puneDir: You said m26s will not leak like 40 times
[2024-06-26T11:50:47] puneDir: icraat kasa and cinayet kasa zero 10x
[2024-06-26T11:50:48] Cengiz Han GEN√áALƒ∞: It does not flow in normal use, but you do not use it normally.

[2024-06-26T11:52:44] puneDir: So its not safe for over 8.5?
[2024-06-26T11:53:25] Cengiz Han GEN√áALƒ∞: I'm sure the inside of that frame is like a spider web
[2024-06-26T11:53:32] FreehandZ: Incraat kasa?
[2024-06-26T11:53:36] puneDir: Why

It's good if it's over, and if there are serious problems with internal organs with months of recovery, our ordinary insurance does not cover it, and extreme insurance for the whole year is not available.

[2024-06-26T20:16:55] El: And those who will meet you? And if there are children on the oncoming scooters / street / car ?
[2024-06-26T20:17:44] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: You are asking what I wil be to blame for an accident ?
[2024-06-26T20:17:58] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: If yes that can happen on a car also
[2024-06-26T20:18:55] El: No , i immediately think of the associated costs.
[2024-06-26T20:19:05] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: In a car you are more likely to kil people then a motorcycle/escooter that is why I think 2 wheeld vehicles should have les harsh rules
[2024-06-26T20:19:30] NetworkDir: :D
[2024-06-26T20:19:42] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: You say what about people who know u and will feel bad that u died ?

[2024-06-26T20:21:14] GABE: ah i thought that was an attempt at an insurance claim
[2024-06-26T20:21:40] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: U didn't notice the police car ?

[2024-06-26T20:22:14] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: He was interacting with the cop
[2024-06-26T20:22:24] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: That was a civilian who ran
[2024-06-26T20:22:25] GABE: oh lol what a retard

[2024-06-26T20:22:47] GABE: i wouldve let him on
[2024-06-26T20:22:57] GABE: just kidding he would steal that shit
[2024-06-26T20:23:24] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: He knows that the cop wil not risk getting hit by the scot

[2024-06-26T20:41:01] Yamal: That bike lane is definitely dangerous, both times they have been in the same place, right?
[2024-06-26T20:44:33] Yamal: The place looks nice, but in the end you're going to have to slap someone
[2024-06-26T20:45:09] GABE: who has a good 17s bms for like 60a cont?
[2024-06-26T20:45:12] Yamal: and it will always be better than hitting someone at 40/50kmh
[2024-06-26T20:46:31] Yamal: holidays in T√ºrkiye,, full face helmet, leather overalls, protections and maybe a football field lighting system to see and be seen...
[2024-06-26T20:47:31] GABE: nvm found it, jbd cheap
[2024-06-26T20:48:38] GABE: wtf theres NO WAY that JBD BMS can peak TRIPLE

[2024-06-26T20:51:27] GABE: watch it, its a need.
[2024-06-26T20:52:26] Yamal: The truth is that I don't watch TV or series or anything, I imagined it was something like that, or maybe a family member...

[2024-06-26T21:11:50] puneDir: Most of us peoples scooter is engineered for that speeds mostly nothing happens if we run over a rock at 90 Also most of us have full moto gear Fullface helmet and other stuff
[2024-06-26T21:12:18] puneDir: Gloves knee pads etc
[2024-06-26T21:17:21] haku: amen brother. preach that gospel
[2024-06-26T21:18:33] haku: my new brand will be scooters are temporary. caskets are forever
[2024-06-26T21:28:53] Yamal: caution and respect for vehicles above all, but if we look at the statistics, cars and motorcycles take the cake. @Bradhaku
[2024-06-26T21:29:37] Noname: My buddy just crashed a unicycle doing near 100kmh and he's fine. Lil sore but nothing a few aspirin can't fix.
[2024-06-26T21:30:19] haku: smaller tires have no chance at those speeds. 1 pebble and your done son.
[2024-06-26T21:30:33] Yamal: We are new vehicles and like everyone we have to make our place in the cities, etc., but it is true that we see very ugly accidents out there.
[2024-06-26T21:32:25] haku: im for freedom and ride whatever you want. but at those speeds i feel like scooters are not designed for that
[2024-06-26T21:34:46] Yamal: Only weped sonic and g30
[2024-06-26T21:34:59] haku: just g30 and laotie

[2024-06-26T21:38:24] haku: thats why hes designing bigger vescs for motos
[2024-06-26T21:40:00] Yamal: It would be nice if I found him there one day, because I know that if I see him I will recognize him!!! we were going to have a laugh together
[2024-06-26T21:42:27] Yamal: Then you would read: "BV has just joined this group"‚Ä¶. :(

[2024-06-26T22:10:27] GABE: i will never charge faster than 0.1C on my 12p pack. ever.
[2024-06-26T22:10:31] Noname: Cells can do it. 40ish amps is enough
[2024-06-26T22:10:44] Noname: Point .1
[2024-06-26T22:10:46] GABE: sure they can do it but the cycle count will get ass raped
[2024-06-26T22:10:57] GABE: check specsheet
[2024-06-26T22:11:08] Noname: It's less than 1/2 max rate
[2024-06-26T22:11:08] GABE: just cause you can doesnt mean you should
[2024-06-26T22:11:14] GABE: for no heat
[2024-06-26T22:11:15] GABE: sure
[2024-06-26T22:11:19] GABE: but how will it act in the long run?

[2024-06-26T22:12:40] GABE: 1c heats up lipo so much it needs an external temp sensor
[2024-06-26T22:12:41] Yamal: Still have 90ah battery?

[2024-06-26T22:14:35] GABE: how much range do you get?
[2024-06-26T22:14:57] GABE: need some xesc fwk on the EUC

[2024-06-26T22:20:04] Noname: The Grey one yeah it's Vesc
[2024-06-26T22:22:29] haku: thats perfect speed to keep up with traffic.
[2024-06-26T22:24:04] Noname: I just pull over if there's traffic. Was out till 9pm really nobody around
[2024-06-26T22:24:51] haku: i would be confident going faster on that niu though
[2024-06-26T22:25:05] haku: bigger wheels
[2024-06-26T22:25:11] Noname: It's 100% stable. Need better brakes though
[2024-06-26T22:25:29] Noname: Suspension is a bit harsh

[2024-06-27T00:06:35] Jan: 149kmh @15kW lol
[2024-06-27T00:07:11] Jan: Unless thats a single motor vesc view, physics make no sense
[2024-06-27T00:07:44] Yamal: Tronic 250r?
[2024-06-27T00:07:53] NetworkDir: Oh dualtron x seris have a wobble problem even 90kmh XD yeah should just tire flip or wrong diameter Also on 600mt trip 150kmh top speed ?
[2024-06-27T00:10:20] Jan: I dont know but it doesnt really matter, his stats does not work in a power drag equation
[2024-06-27T00:11:34] Jan: It states that the Power equals half * air density * airdrag coefficient * frontal Area * velocity to the third power
[2024-06-27T00:12:03] puneDir: Seems like my zero is getting sold
[2024-06-27T00:12:10] Jan: If i put in some values that make sense for a sideways standing human i get this plot

[2024-06-27T00:13:22] Jason: or just single motor data
[2024-06-27T00:13:26] Jan: @SibClimb as someone that frequently reaches the speeds, what are your common values for power at 150km/h?
[2024-06-27T00:13:37] Jan: Must be but he claims otherwise
[2024-06-27T00:13:44] Jason: ye
[2024-06-27T00:13:47] Jason: *sus*
[2024-06-27T00:15:27] Jan: What ive learned in physics, lots of stuff can be simply checked with energy and power equations if something is in the order of magnitude correct. You can get similar results with it compared to quite complicated simulations.
[2024-06-27T00:15:59] Jan: For example brake disc temperature can be calculated with energy equations

[2024-06-27T00:22:54] NetworkDir: 90-100max
[2024-06-27T00:23:07] Jan: For 15kW should be around 115-125kmh
[2024-06-27T00:23:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: From my experience, is contrary, but I would buy also xuancheng because price don't worth it
[2024-06-27T00:23:13] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Too low for the price
[2024-06-27T00:23:36] NetworkDir: Yeah but have a good distance millage
[2024-06-27T00:23:45] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: That is true
[2024-06-27T00:23:47] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Does the rule of closer to the ground more stable also applicable to electric scooters ?
[2024-06-27T00:24:39] NetworkDir: 22s 60Ah
[2024-06-27T00:24:48] NetworkDir: 5000Wh
[2024-06-27T00:25:15] NetworkDir: With vesc and 20-30kmh speed easily you can travel 200-220km xD
[2024-06-27T00:25:45] NetworkDir: <animation>
[2024-06-27T00:25:46] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I don't think you want to travel that slow with that scooter
[2024-06-27T00:26:22] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Also need garage for that big of a scooter .
[2024-06-27T00:29:12] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Also is the trail now better then stock ? Put a 150mm 1500lbs (too stiff imo) exa 291r shock

[2024-06-27T00:30:16] NetworkDir: Yeah very better
[2024-06-27T00:30:37] Face de Pin Suc√©: More than 25KW
[2024-06-27T00:31:05] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: What do u say about putting 150 in the rear ?
[2024-06-27T00:31:21] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: (I ordered by maistake)
[2024-06-27T00:32:21] NetworkDir: Should fine rear actually optional put and just test it but better balance with front
[2024-06-27T00:33:00] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: The front too stiff 1500lbs
[2024-06-27T00:33:52] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: But what I got by maistake (on the way) is 1250lbs going to switch (1500 rear 1250front)
[2024-06-27T00:34:49] NetworkDir: For get stable positive trail better use hard/stiff suspension but anyway it's fine and very much better stock
[2024-06-27T00:35:38] NetworkDir: Yeah for your weight stiff 1500lbs
[2024-06-27T00:42:28] 'lekrsu': Might just be not enough cooling for it to suffice continuously on its parts
[2024-06-27T00:49:18] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-06-27T01:04:30] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: So move it to the rear ?

[2024-06-27T01:07:48] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: What scooter?
[2024-06-27T01:14:58] Yamal: Dual strong modified
[2024-06-27T02:36:06] Chris Culver: on my ubox v2, the ignite connector broke off. is this possible to fix easily?
[2024-06-27T02:38:36] haku: maybe if you know how to put new jst connectors on pcb.
[2024-06-27T04:53:49] Rose: Hey there C, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-06-27T06:12:30] Thierry: Do you have the link? I'm struggling to find

[2024-06-27T10:38:31] Yamal: Old Chinese frame no can fine
[2024-06-27T10:39:11] Yamal: Is like dualtron ultra
[2024-06-27T10:39:34] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: You think that the spring from 165mm will fit the 150mm shock ? Since there is some threads left ?
[2024-06-27T10:49:48] crimeware: This is impressive riding, a good way to outrun the police with style.
[2024-06-27T10:59:11] GABE: OMG I THOught that was shit dude
[2024-06-27T11:17:51] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: For some reason motor with no fwk doesn't want to accelerate on hard ground

[2024-06-27T12:43:11] Konstantin: Fuse xDDD
[2024-06-27T12:46:10] yoann tsobanoglou: Fuse I know, the value ( its for the ignite port on a spintend 100v 100a)
[2024-06-27T13:20:47] yoann tsobanoglou: It‚Äôs a slow blow, I think 125v 1amp or less surface mount Littelfuse
[2024-06-27T13:27:27] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Does someone has firmware for makerbase 75200 v1 ?
[2024-06-27T13:27:48] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Motor too hot thinking problem is firmware
[2024-06-27T13:27:59] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: (For some reason motor with no fwk doesn't want to accelerate on hard ground)
[2024-06-27T15:58:09] Patrick: Vesc compatible display arrived
[2024-06-27T15:58:59] Yamal: Mijia display?
[2024-06-27T15:59:04] Patrick: <photos/photo_15779@27-06-2024_15-59-04.jpg>
[2024-06-27T15:59:44] Patrick: Yea Xiaomi display
[2024-06-27T15:59:52] Patrick: Available for g30 soon too
[2024-06-27T16:13:28] crimeware: He wanted to fuck around
[2024-06-27T16:37:10] puneDir: This aint for vesc
[2024-06-27T16:39:26] NetworkDir: If compatible with pro2/g30 protocol should work with lisp :D
[2024-06-27T16:41:22] 'lekrsu': But these things are to show things as individual group voltage and such, right?
[2024-06-27T16:41:40] 'lekrsu': otherwise whats the point
[2024-06-27T16:42:15] 'lekrsu': Is the lisp script supporting what is otherwise bms data requested on a NB esc w/ NB bms?
[2024-06-27T16:52:24] 'lekrsu': time to simulate motors during this heat wave
[2024-06-27T16:59:43] 'lekrsu': When they say 'just double the field weakening'
[2024-06-27T16:59:43] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 'lekrsu' has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-06-27T17:16:21] Rose: Hey there Stone, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2024-06-27T18:56:45] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: .
[2024-06-27T19:02:23] Jacob: Hey where do you guys find the beta firmware?
[2024-06-27T19:02:56] GABE: check peak current limit?
[2024-06-27T19:03:21] GABE: vesc site, everything is there.
[2024-06-27T19:03:24] GABE: BETA ALL. ZIP
[2024-06-27T19:03:43] GABE: oh also, the mac version is not functioning. fyi.
[2024-06-27T19:04:30] GABE: Motor could be saturated.
[2024-06-27T19:04:30] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-06-27T19:04:58] Jacob: But the beta all is just vesc tool. I mean the beta firmware for the vesc itself
[2024-06-27T19:07:17] GABE: its included
[2024-06-27T19:09:09] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: And what does that means?
[2024-06-27T19:09:47] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: 230
[2024-06-27T19:10:30] GABE: does it say overcurrent when you accelerate from zero?
[2024-06-27T19:10:54] GABE: too hot to use unless you inject more fwk, which then it eventually blows
[2024-06-27T19:11:08] GABE: i had the same issue before
[2024-06-27T19:12:29] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I'm telling you I just started driving
[2024-06-27T19:12:38] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: It's was not hot
[2024-06-27T19:13:09] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Don't think so
[2024-06-27T19:14:47] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: And I lowered down the phase amps to what it was before and still choking
[2024-06-27T19:15:21] GABE: did you recently solder anything?
[2024-06-27T19:15:43] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Like before it was 120 phase and 50a field 70a battery and running fine I got suggestion to remove fwk for less heat
[2024-06-27T19:15:55] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: In the motor ?
[2024-06-27T19:16:02] GABE: on the scooter itself
[2024-06-27T19:16:06] GABE: or motor sure
[2024-06-27T19:16:13] GABE: perhaps resistance issue.
[2024-06-27T19:16:31] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: How do I check resistance?
[2024-06-27T19:16:45] GABE: just need to know this
[2024-06-27T19:16:48] GABE: specifically
[2024-06-27T19:16:55] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Yes
[2024-06-27T19:17:08] GABE: and this issue didnt exist before then
[2024-06-27T19:17:20] GABE: the motor?
[2024-06-27T19:17:36] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Exited only on high % on fwk
[2024-06-27T19:17:52] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Sensor back to place
[2024-06-27T19:18:07] GABE: You may have not pushed in the copper wire all the way into the bullets. did you touch those?
[2024-06-27T19:18:12] GABE: then not it. damn
[2024-06-27T19:18:21] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: And strengthen the phase connection
[2024-06-27T19:18:42] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: What bullets ?
[2024-06-27T19:18:43] GABE: @jamessoderstrom and i had this issue and it was a resistance issue
[2024-06-27T19:18:49] GABE: for the 3 phases
[2024-06-27T19:18:54] GABE: gold plug
[2024-06-27T19:19:08] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Yes but what did I push whare ?
[2024-06-27T19:19:12] GABE: check with multimeter, ideally should be 0 ohms?
[2024-06-27T19:19:19] GABE: the copper strands
[2024-06-27T19:19:26] GABE: not deep enough inside the plugs
[2024-06-27T19:19:37] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: What wire to touch
[2024-06-27T19:19:42] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Maybe
[2024-06-27T19:19:44] GABE: phase start to end
[2024-06-27T19:19:58] GABE: ah shit may have to open motor for this
[2024-06-27T19:19:59] GABE: hell
[2024-06-27T19:20:08] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Don't want to
[2024-06-27T19:20:12] GABE: Yeah, figured.
[2024-06-27T19:20:20] GABE: if this persists its definitely that
[2024-06-27T19:20:32] GABE: the overlords will find out if its not that
[2024-06-27T19:20:35] GABE: surely
[2024-06-27T19:20:38] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Have stetorade inside
[2024-06-27T19:20:56] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: That one from grin technologies
[2024-06-27T19:21:13] GABE: metal particles. surely doesnt matter what brand
[2024-06-27T19:21:20] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Why when I have fwk on its running fine then ?
[2024-06-27T19:21:31] GABE: because it keeps fucking more amps into it
[2024-06-27T19:21:36] GABE: i think
[2024-06-27T19:21:53] GABE: so it just overpowers it
[2024-06-27T19:22:03] GABE: wires could get super hot and cause a short
[2024-06-27T19:22:20] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Maybe change whole harness?
[2024-06-27T19:22:29] GABE: show pic, wtf is harness
[2024-06-27T19:22:40] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: And take the chance also to put temp sensor?
[2024-06-27T19:22:49] GABE: me and @jamessoderstrom thought the motor was burned
[2024-06-27T19:22:58] GABE: deadass
[2024-06-27T19:23:04] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: This wire
[2024-06-27T19:23:04] GABE: it ended up just being a resistance issue
[2024-06-27T19:23:40] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: If wire is small but bullet is big more resistance?
[2024-06-27T19:23:53] GABE: same resistance.
[2024-06-27T19:24:00] GABE: power takes the shortest way
[2024-06-27T19:24:17] GABE: if a straw had a bulge in the middle, it wouldnt change flow
[2024-06-27T19:24:24] GABE: power is identical to water, unless im retarded
[2024-06-27T19:25:13] GABE: if the wire doesnt have direct contact with the shell of the plug, then the solder acts as a choke on resistance
[2024-06-27T19:25:13] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-06-27T19:25:17] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: So leave it as be just not drive a lot till do dual setup
[2024-06-27T19:56:14] sombre_enfant: This one is ass if road is a bit wet
[2024-06-27T19:56:51] sombre_enfant: Yeah get those if xuancheng
[2024-06-27T20:07:21] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Some people said tuvot better
[2024-06-27T20:07:41] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I have one motor mantis 10 and one Zero10x

[2024-06-27T22:17:27] GABE: ''getting caught''

[2024-06-27T22:18:39] haku: im a law abiding citizen
[2024-06-27T22:18:49] GABE: nobody is with these insane psychos in the court.
[2024-06-27T22:19:01] GABE: they should ban bicycles entirely.
[2024-06-27T22:19:47] haku: i wonder what state this is because this is not an issue where im from.
[2024-06-27T22:21:13] haku: run away from the police here you get shot baby.
[2024-06-27T22:21:34] haku: and i pay my taxes for them to do exactly that
[2024-06-27T22:21:59] GABE: hah assuming they can aim like that if you swerve.
[2024-06-27T22:22:08] GABE: if youre black, sure.
[2024-06-27T22:22:12] GABE: if youre white, not really.
[2024-06-27T22:22:32] GABE: or nonblack.
[2024-06-27T22:22:52] haku: not really where im from we all get equally shot for stupid shit
[2024-06-27T22:23:20] GABE: theres no way they can just shoot you when unprovoked
[2024-06-27T22:23:32] GABE: nah, these 150mph scooters are becoming more of a necessity now.
[2024-06-27T22:23:43] haku: but in my hood there are worse criminals than ebikes. police doesnt care about ebikez here
[2024-06-27T22:24:01] GABE: we dont go on highways anyway.
[2024-06-27T22:25:05] GABE: so nimble its impossible to get caught lol
[2024-06-27T22:25:17] GABE: or like wear a kevlar vest when you go out scooting
[2024-06-27T22:25:22] GABE: cant believe i just had to say that
[2024-06-27T22:25:46] haku: maybe in ireland. you can get away easy
[2024-06-27T22:25:54] GABE: police only carry bats here, special ops discluded, they have guns.
[2024-06-27T22:25:55] GABE: LOL
[2024-06-27T22:25:59] GABE: taser at most

[2024-06-27T23:32:14] Basti: Hey guys, I have a question: is it possible that ABS overcurrent can also be triggered by a loose connection in the hall sensors? I have run the hall detection several times and every time I shake the hall sensor cable string the detection is faulty. If I leave it still, it finds the hall sensors without any problem. I had ABS overcurrent from time to time in the past, I am wondering if that is the problem or if there is a second problem. Thx for your help‚úåÔ∏è

[2024-06-28T00:38:54] Jan: 70kmh is quite the meat crayon speed, how could he walk away?
[2024-06-28T00:39:16] NetworkDir: Even geometry fine drive with one hand and some hole on road :
[2024-06-28T00:39:58] NetworkDir: Yeah 70kmh is high speed but he have a good protections (like helmet - gloves and etc)
[2024-06-28T00:43:38] Jan: Legs, hips, elbow is free
[2024-06-28T00:44:24] Martin Kaktits: looks like he fell ON the scooter stem/ handlebars and that protected him at least partly
[2024-06-28T00:44:37] haku: he hit a pothole or a rock
[2024-06-28T00:45:20] haku: look at how the scoot bounced before the crash
[2024-06-28T00:45:38] NetworkDir: Pothole
[2024-06-28T00:45:47] NetworkDir: Fucking shitty roads
[2024-06-28T00:46:31] haku: hope this guy is okay

[2024-06-28T00:49:00] NetworkDir: Poor pro2 with 8.5inch tire and potholeüò≠
[2024-06-28T00:50:03] haku: not even 13" tires can save you from some potholes
[2024-06-28T00:50:57] haku: standing also makes it difficult on those situations. center of balance. harder to recover
[2024-06-28T00:53:08] haku: that walk of shame happened to me too all bloodied up limping to the house
[2024-06-28T01:21:32] haku: he lost grip
[2024-06-28T01:37:51] haku: atleast he fell good. just slide. no ragdoll physics

[2024-06-29T12:27:19] Happy Giraffe: Chargers have special design in them to gently fill the last % of the cell. Therefore they will have longer life and be charged fully when using a cheap bms without active balance

[2024-06-29T19:32:07] GABE: spintend is fine with 20s.
[2024-06-29T19:32:15] GABE: 80v line anyway
[2024-06-29T19:41:58] Chen Simhony: Cool is it can handle 150a current 100a battery and 70fw? Connect to copper heatsink
[2024-06-29T19:43:45] GABE: i believe you need the 12fet for that. Continious the 80100 will never do.
[2024-06-29T19:44:06] GABE: and where is that copper connected to
[2024-06-29T19:44:46] GABE: i can visualize it now actually.

[2024-06-29T19:45:54] GABE: bottom of scoot?

[2024-06-29T19:50:16] GABE: 80200
[2024-06-29T19:50:34] GABE: 80100 is not powerful enough for 100a cont.
[2024-06-29T19:50:56] GABE: more like peak is ok.

[2024-06-29T23:41:50] Noname: What?
[2024-06-29T23:42:37] haku: idk what you call it but when you run out of battery you can still start by pushing and clutch.
[2024-06-30T00:15:36] Noname: I said stick for slingshots. Bumb start for bikes
[2024-06-30T00:16:56] haku: oh lol

[2024-06-30T01:39:59] Yamal: + 47A FW XD
[2024-06-30T01:42:33] Yamal: The truth is that it is the first time that both identical controllers are going to go, I plan to start with 150A on both motors without fw and nothing and collecting data, maybe at night on the highway I can raise it a little to do some tests and nothing, everything depends on What temperature do they work normally and when they are stressed, but for me personally Little Forcer gives me good vibes
[2024-06-30T02:09:41] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Im on foc

[2024-06-30T17:21:23] Jason: ooo
[2024-06-30T17:21:37] Jason: how much speed with 3kw of power?
[2024-06-30T17:22:18] NetworkDir: Single dual? Voltage ? What motor?
[2024-06-30T17:22:33] Jason: single 60v ninebot es2 300w motor
[2024-06-30T17:22:37] Jason: also
[2024-06-30T17:22:53] NetworkDir: ‚ò†Ô∏è do you want peak 3000W on es2 motor?
[2024-06-30T17:22:55] Jason: dual front 36v rear 60v es2 motor front 1500w rear 3kw
[2024-06-30T17:23:00] Jason: I did lol
[2024-06-30T17:23:11] Jason: but ill keep under 2kw
[2024-06-30T17:23:17] NetworkDir: your motor soon would cooked
[2024-06-30T17:23:27] Jason: yea
[2024-06-30T17:23:34] Jason: so I want to keep under 2kw lol
[2024-06-30T17:23:42] NetworkDir: You have a low kv motor so max 50-60kmh i think
[2024-06-30T17:24:04] Jason: with fwk?
[2024-06-30T17:24:19] NetworkDir: Yes
[2024-06-30T17:24:34] Jason: mmm
[2024-06-30T17:24:56] Jason: man first time I did with dual was 36v and reached 55km
[2024-06-30T17:53:08] Jan: Just air resistance probably around 75-85kmh, but other factors are much more in play. See the faster you get the more air drag gets a factor as it increases power requirements to power of 3
[2024-06-30T17:53:58] Jason: daaamn
[2024-06-30T17:54:18] Jan: mechanically roll resistance is there too, also it doesnt say anything about your electrical setup
[2024-06-30T17:54:28] Jan: At 24V you wont get 80kmh
[2024-06-30T17:55:06] Jan: It requires a electrical setup that makes sense for the speeds
[2024-06-30T18:00:03] Patrick: And with around 4kw? You think i can reach 80km/h?
[2024-06-30T18:07:27] Jan: Yes should be from an energy standpoint be possible

[2024-07-01T11:27:02] Face de Pin Suc√©: The guy made a 3min video to express how hard and how he needs to learn to ride "hyperscooter" he doesn't even reach 100Kmh
[2024-07-01T11:27:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: on a straight line
[2024-07-01T11:27:35] Yamal: It is a Spanish expression, I do not know the exact translation,, the same as: "what salt shaker do you have"! I don't know the simile in English
[2024-07-01T11:28:03] Yamal: Hey man take easy! Keep calm
[2024-07-01T11:28:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: I don't understand why so many words for such a small performance x)
[2024-07-01T11:28:13] Yamal: Give him time ,,,
[2024-07-01T11:28:23] Yamal: Just I new machine ride,,,
[2024-07-01T11:28:44] Face de Pin Suc√©: but have you heard what he's saying
[2024-07-01T11:28:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's like he's going to the moon
[2024-07-01T11:30:08] NetworkDir: 40HP 30kW scooter just can reach ~90-95km/h? Dualtron ultra2 with 40-40A 72V and 6700W can reach 95km/h xD
[2024-07-01T11:31:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: <photos/photo_15830@01-07-2024_11-31-55.jpg>
[2024-07-01T11:32:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: I will make a 3min video explaining how fast, powerful, hard, amazing it is every morning to reach 100Kmh in town
[2024-07-01T11:34:13] Yamal: Let's see if he hasn't even reached his top speed, which I suppose will be around 130, remember that if there is something that limits the Apex are your engines
[2024-07-01T11:36:10] Mirono escooters: https://youtu.be/6QgsopBVO8I?feature=shared
[2024-07-01T11:36:22] Mirono escooters: Can we use a temporary button instead of a locking for cruise control?
[2024-07-01T11:36:29] Mirono escooters: Seems more logical to use temporary
[2024-07-01T11:36:35] Yamal: Besides, you have to get on the scooter, it's like everything,, I imagine it doesn't have to be easy to get used to that level of acceleration with the download that has on 22/3..
[2024-07-01T11:36:49] Face de Pin Suc√©: Thats is bullshit, this scooter never reaches 30KW regarding his engines haha I guess it will do around 20-25KW max max
[2024-07-01T11:41:17] Yamal: What speed do you estimate it reaches?
[2024-07-01T11:42:27] Jan: What is it again? 2x Tronic 250R and a 20S7P P42a with Daly BMS
[2024-07-01T11:43:02] Jan: Technically its about 22.5kW limited
[2024-07-01T11:43:03] Yamal: X12 not 250r more..
[2024-07-01T11:43:52] Jan: You sure? As its their own brand and the apex is already quite old, i think its the 250R
[2024-07-01T11:44:17] Yamal: I think he talk about x12..
[2024-07-01T11:45:41] NetworkDir: also he say 100.8V
[2024-07-01T11:46:14] Jan: Ah 24S
[2024-07-01T11:46:33] Jan: Then its 27kW
[2024-07-01T11:47:09] Jan: You can calculate the topspeed from the power value
[2024-07-01T11:48:45] NetworkDir: 60-60A 72V on 16x4 (50H) 10800W what's you think for top speed
[2024-07-01T11:49:15] NetworkDir: also idk why 50h on 60v can reach 90km/h free-wheel and 72v reach 105km/h on free-wheel ..
[2024-07-01T11:51:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: X12 and 24S
[2024-07-01T11:56:10] Jan: Maybe 110-115
[2024-07-01T11:56:37] Jan: But thats physical barrier

[2024-07-01T20:10:59] Martin Kaktits: Heyo. People with dual motor setup - how much phase amps you push in front motor (and which motor) before it starts skidding out? I have vsett motor in front and at 100A phase its impossible to hold it down without traction control on. Just burns rubber :D Something like 70A becomes possible without TC. Seems low.
[2024-07-01T20:35:46] NetworkDir: You can use Motor Current Scale (with profile) + TC
[2024-07-01T20:38:02] Martin Kaktits: oo right thats an idea
[2024-07-01T20:39:14] Martin Kaktits: does it change with RPM?

[2024-07-02T11:42:52] 'lekrsu': Like twice the size of ANT, with a third of the amperage, :D

[2024-07-02T15:37:01] 'lekrsu': Those of you that use 1zuna's dash script, have any of you fitted an 0603 1k resistor on the pcb rather than on the cabling? And if you have, does it function on a G30 ESC afterwards?
[2024-07-02T15:45:37] Mirono escooters: Tis noise on cable, i think it can be fixed in software
[2024-07-02T15:45:46] Mirono escooters: Have a min button press time for a few ms
[2024-07-02T15:47:02] 'lekrsu': I see, so that's why its otherwise doing ghost presses? So one can do it without adding 1k?
[2024-07-02T15:47:20] Mirono escooters: :? You need the resistor
[2024-07-02T15:47:36] Mirono escooters: But I think the bug can be software fixed Idk, no time to take my oscilloscoop to it
[2024-07-02T15:51:04] 'lekrsu': Yeah alright. And you soldered in one of these in the cabling then, or 0603 on the pcb?
[2024-07-02T15:51:43] Mirono escooters: Cabling

[2024-07-02T16:01:37] NetworkDir: Bad wiring? Shorted wires? Fired STM? Bad firmware?
[2024-07-02T16:07:56] 'lekrsu': Hmm, I don't see why that would matter, but I'll do that.

[2024-07-02T16:10:07] NetworkDir: Looks lg m50lt + molicel on 1 pack‚ò†Ô∏è
[2024-07-02T16:11:27] NetworkDir: If capacity same maybe fine if you do 1p with different cell but m50lt is 5000mAh and molicel 4000mAh cause a big problems
[2024-07-02T16:12:10] Yamal: I think under the Williams f1 too
[2024-07-02T16:12:37] Yamal: O wherever name,,, ESC scooter ,,,
[2024-07-02T16:14:39] Franchesco Carofano: They are stocked in each base there must be 4 cells or 8 cells and in all the bases the same
[2024-07-02T16:49:31] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: It's the same as a bomb. I personally wouldn't put that battery in.
[2024-07-02T17:17:50] Jhonny Nu√±ez: Yes, 60 cell molicell
[2024-07-02T17:18:26] NetworkDir: Anyone have a experience with setup EUC with vesc? i have a problem on one way power is good and on one way have don't torque ..
[2024-07-02T17:20:11] Franchesco Carofano: You drive the scooter like an old car, Vicente, what are you going to think? You're going to know if it's more damaged than it is when walking.
[2024-07-02T17:22:10] Jhonny Nu√±ez: As long as you do not demand the cell with the least discharge, it will not happen, in this case I have 150A discharge, the LG discharge up to 200A, the battery was made with a battery and cell specialist and the complete glasses were not made and only 4 cells were added by glasses
[2024-07-02T17:25:33] Jason: 2k also works
[2024-07-02T17:25:40] Jason: and 5k
[2024-07-02T17:45:42] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: That's true as long as you don't demand more from the LG download nothing will happen
[2024-07-02T17:47:22] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: I would like to see those professionals that you mention ironically ü§£
[2024-07-02T18:14:52] Franchesco Carofano: It has been running with the battery for two months and has not had a problem. When you do it half and half, they are supplied with batteries constantly balancing with a 1ah balancer.
[2024-07-02T18:18:49] Franchesco Carofano: The man walks very well and weighs 130 kilos. Look at the speed he has achieved.

[2024-07-02T19:54:01] Jhonny Nu√±ez: That's why I have a 150A bms, it is below the maximum discharge of the 35Ah LG battery, the entire calculation was made to not take the cells to the extreme, the Molicells were added to support the autonomy of the scooter, since they do not they are going to be exposed to the limit

[2024-07-03T22:56:01] puneDir: they replaced it same day
[2024-07-03T22:56:24] puneDir: im using new ones for around 1800 km
[2024-07-03T22:56:27] puneDir: theyre good
[2024-07-03T22:56:31] puneDir: never pass 42c
[2024-07-03T22:56:36] Yamal: 84200//A battery max?
[2024-07-03T22:56:48] puneDir: im planning to use 200a battery
[2024-07-03T22:56:50] puneDir: phase idk

[2024-07-03T22:57:10] NetworkDir: x12 and 3shul hardly can handle this but idk ..
[2024-07-03T22:57:16] puneDir: 20p is enough for 200a
[2024-07-03T22:57:23] puneDir: ye
[2024-07-03T22:57:25] NetworkDir: m26 and 10A per cell ? :)
[2024-07-03T22:57:34] puneDir: ok than 180a
[2024-07-03T22:57:39] puneDir: cry about it
[2024-07-03T22:58:16] puneDir: they removed 84200 from aliexpress
[2024-07-03T22:58:19] puneDir: idk where it went
[2024-07-03T22:58:29] puneDir: waiting for them

[2024-07-03T23:00:43] puneDir: we already reverse engineered it with cengiz a while ago
[2024-07-03T23:00:56] puneDir: thats why i have shit resistor mod on 84100s
[2024-07-03T23:01:17] Yamal: It's surprising, it's simply double what I use at the moment,
[2024-07-03T23:01:27] puneDir: btw one of that thing is connected to phase b
[2024-07-03T23:02:31] puneDir: hell no
[2024-07-03T23:02:43] puneDir: the end of the circuit is already connected to phase b
[2024-07-03T23:02:44] puneDir: wait
[2024-07-03T23:03:04] puneDir: <photos/photo_15880@03-07-2024_23-03-04.jpg>
[2024-07-03T23:03:19] puneDir: somewhere of the upper side is connected to phase b
[2024-07-03T23:03:32] puneDir: cengiz has the full explanation i dont remember what it was
[2024-07-03T23:03:41] puneDir: to wake it up when you turn the motor
[2024-07-03T23:04:06] puneDir: dont do this btw it was an expirement to try something

[2024-07-04T10:41:39] GABE: how much do you wanna push wit it
[2024-07-04T10:41:45] puneDir: <photos/photo_15882@04-07-2024_10-41-45.jpg>
[2024-07-04T10:41:51] puneDir: This motor able to pull this
[2024-07-04T10:41:55] puneDir: 300a
[2024-07-04T10:41:59] puneDir: With water cooling
[2024-07-04T10:42:02] GABE: why not go double
[2024-07-04T10:42:13] puneDir: Cuz its an e bike
[2024-07-04T10:42:17] GABE: ah wait impossible to source same motor
[2024-07-04T10:42:25] puneDir: What?
[2024-07-04T10:42:27] GABE: nah like double on main transmission
[2024-07-04T10:42:34] puneDir: Its possible but
[2024-07-04T10:42:49] puneDir: Motor is pretty big and i cant fit 20s20p with that
[2024-07-04T10:43:08] GABE: can i see ur project rn>
[2024-07-04T10:43:12] puneDir: Sure

[2024-07-04T11:14:11] Yamal: Nice e-bike for enjoy the summer
[2024-07-04T11:14:35] Yamal: But for me better scooter
[2024-07-04T11:15:00] puneDir: i also have the zero :D
[2024-07-04T11:15:10] Yamal: but I understand why you want the motorcycle
[2024-07-04T11:24:18] Yamal: @Bradhaku everything ok? we miss you.. :(
[2024-07-04T11:25:14] FreehandZ: Mostly is difference in carrying liquid I think
[2024-07-04T11:26:28] Yamal: I am looking forward to seeing liquid cooling in electric vehicles of this type, and in scooters too.
[2024-07-04T11:27:04] FreehandZ: How so?
[2024-07-04T11:27:15] FreehandZ: Well, ESC is easy
[2024-07-04T11:27:26] FreehandZ: Motor?
[2024-07-04T11:27:37] Yamal: ESC
[2024-07-04T11:28:11] FreehandZ: Hmm. Reservoir and pump could take up valuable battery space
[2024-07-04T12:24:04] Yamal: https://youtu.be/kLEsieJbWCk?si=aWrzxcw9T7y_14x9
[2024-07-04T12:33:36] Yamal: I found the song by chance and I hadn't heard it, including the artist, for a lot of years...

[2024-07-04T12:35:14] Yamal: Benjamin also likes this artist and this songxD
[2024-07-04T12:38:18] Yamal: Let's not forget that today is a day of celebration after last night's achievement,,, we are getting closer to the Moon and further from the Earth,, @Vescmania
[2024-07-04T12:38:18] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-07-04T13:15:00] GABE: depends how you engineer the thing
[2024-07-04T13:16:46] GABE: it only needs a micro reservoir and pump.
[2024-07-04T13:17:01] GABE: it doesnt radiate that much energy lmfao, its not like a car engine where most energy goes to vibrations aka heat
[2024-07-04T13:20:11] GABE: Cars can have a real vent at the front, more surface area. for scooters not feasible cause thin body
[2024-07-04T13:29:00] Yamal: 70h!!!!!
[2024-07-04T13:29:21] GABE: motors can also have real water cooling.
[2024-07-04T13:29:43] GABE: Like with RC CARS we have like a full on water cooling setup for our motors.
[2024-07-04T13:30:06] GABE: This tech has existed for decades.
[2024-07-04T13:30:12] FreehandZ: Hmm how?
[2024-07-04T13:30:16] GABE: Simple.
[2024-07-04T13:30:18] FreehandZ: The rotor is rotating
[2024-07-04T13:30:21] FreehandZ: Stator is internal
[2024-07-04T13:30:22] GABE: no.
[2024-07-04T13:30:27] GABE: reversed.
[2024-07-04T13:30:51] GABE: only hub motors are like that. do you not know the entire geometry can be reversed?
[2024-07-04T13:30:58] GABE: the magnet can be on the inside, and the windings outside. windings have contact with the hull, that has total water cooling.
[2024-07-04T13:31:39] FreehandZ: Yes but no longer hub motor
[2024-07-04T13:31:46] GABE: Doesnt matter for cars whatsoever.
[2024-07-04T13:31:52] FreehandZ: Well for scooters I mean
[2024-07-04T13:32:22] GABE: soon soon my child.
[2024-07-04T13:32:23] Yamal: Weped dark night have
[2024-07-04T13:33:17] GABE: you can still engineer it to have water cooling. itll just look weird and widen the hub. You could have an entire oil system flowing through the internal stator windings. going from left to right.
[2024-07-04T13:33:55] GABE: Oil is non conductive, and no metal should ever scrape off like a car engine, as AC Motors run indefinitely and never need such maintenance,so nothing will ever short. also, doubles up as ferrofluid
[2024-07-04T13:34:35] GABE: the oil valve would be like the 3 phase wire, going into the stator, but no contact with the outside moving part.
[2024-07-04T13:35:14] GABE: sure, the con would be less battery space, but the pro would be multiplied power output capabilities. im guessing any oil drag would be countered by the higher efficiency and power output.
[2024-07-04T13:45:20] Yamal: I like that word ‚Äúflowing‚Äù
[2024-07-04T14:01:58] Yamal: I like for this long time I keep üòÇ

[2024-07-04T15:45:54] NetworkDir: for 10inch and bad road conditions i recommend to use tovut 90/55-6 because have a good grip PMT grip very better from Tovut but pmt very soft tire and on bad roads fucked up instantly
[2024-07-04T15:48:07] NetworkDir: Do you have a lisp with g30/m365 dash ?

[2024-07-04T15:55:19] GABE: whats the name of the pmt slicks that grip better.
[2024-07-04T15:55:26] GABE: like, not the slicks but still pmt
[2024-07-04T15:56:01] Yamal: I use xuancheng for the same reason, I have to step on stones daily and sand daily, but well the truth be told that pmt is quality

[2024-07-04T16:49:00] Happy Giraffe: Thailand is good place to practice sword fighting and test the vaccines effect
[2024-07-04T16:54:06] Yamal: what's up, south east asian is cool
[2024-07-04T16:54:10] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-07-04T16:59:02] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-07-04T17:05:47] Patrick: Was installed before
[2024-07-04T17:05:58] Patrick: But i removed it and flashed firmware new
[2024-07-04T17:06:13] Patrick: Motor runs now pretty good except for the start and that its limiting somehow
[2024-07-04T17:06:56] NetworkDir: go to motor settings -> general -> [wattage + rpm + current] and send screenshot
[2024-07-04T17:07:18] Patrick: <video_file>
[2024-07-04T17:07:21] Patrick: <photos/photo_15892@04-07-2024_17-07-21.jpg>
[2024-07-04T17:07:34] Patrick: Also when holding the motor from hand it somehow isnt getting enough power
[2024-07-04T17:07:53] Patrick: I set 30A battery, 60A motor current max & 100A absolute current
[2024-07-04T17:08:19] Patrick: But only when changing the 3A it works
[2024-07-04T17:08:20] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Patrick has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-07-04T17:10:40] NetworkDir: RPM and current?
[2024-07-04T17:12:59] Patrick: RPM 10000 on the bottem
[2024-07-04T17:13:09] Patrick: .
[2024-07-04T17:22:18] Patrick: Any ideas? Also when activating FW with 5A i reach 22km/h but with more then 5A fw it drops down again
[2024-07-04T17:25:41] Jason: @ESt1ft the dash lisp changes erpm limit
[2024-07-04T17:28:55] Patrick: Script isnt installed and when testing dash was unplugged
[2024-07-04T17:30:17] Patrick: Where did you find limits on the phone?
[2024-07-04T17:30:58] Patrick: Because max ERPM are already changed
[2024-07-04T17:31:08] Patrick: But i am still not getting over 7000 ERPM
[2024-07-04T17:44:50] Patrick: Even with dash script it limits to 20
[2024-07-04T17:44:50] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Patrick has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-07-04T17:53:09] Jason: change erpm
[2024-07-04T18:10:13] Patrick: I did
[2024-07-04T18:10:17] Patrick: 15000
[2024-07-04T18:10:31] Patrick: Didnt change anything
[2024-07-04T18:13:07] 'lekrsu': Do I cut this off and solder directly to the motor?
[2024-07-04T18:15:26] Patrick: Just connect it
[2024-07-04T18:15:55] Patrick: I cut if off and used the 1 plug
[2024-07-04T18:16:45] puneDir: lol
[2024-07-04T18:17:11] 'lekrsu': wdym?
[2024-07-04T18:18:09] 'lekrsu': cut what off, connect what?
[2024-07-04T18:31:43] 'lekrsu': alright, hate to do it but guess I'll have to
[2024-07-04T19:00:59] 'lekrsu': stole a bms wire
[2024-07-04T19:24:13] Jason: I usually
[2024-07-04T19:24:16] Jason: just try not to cut
[2024-07-04T19:24:50] Jason: btw what is that film you using on batt?
[2024-07-04T19:25:09] Patrick: So i still need help, when going full throttle duty cycle goes to the set 95% and motor still spins 20 so my question why
[2024-07-04T19:29:42] Happy Giraffe: 70A fw is a ton and I doubt your motor will handle it
[2024-07-04T19:30:01] 'lekrsu': extra protection
[2024-07-04T19:30:12] 'lekrsu': no reason
[2024-07-04T19:30:27] Patrick: I dont know what happend did script new now works for some reason also dity cycle adjusted now
[2024-07-04T19:31:50] Chen Simhony: motor was good with it again thanks to ferrofluid and heatsink I'm not going to go full throttle for 10km but now the controller is dead so I'm looking into other options heard the 75200 is bad just die suddenly
[2024-07-04T19:32:36] Patrick: I only have the problem that the engine makes something like a cracking sound for a short time when starting and stutters when the speed limiter is activated at low speeds below 15 km/h. Any ideas for this maybe? Tried observer already
[2024-07-04T20:43:25] 'lekrsu': Alright, completely new, do I load defaults?
[2024-07-04T20:45:16] 'lekrsu': alr lets do that
[2024-07-04T22:10:02] FreehandZ: Then sooo much resistance...

[2024-07-05T00:11:41] Yamal: What I don't understand is why it runs so little if it's 21s with a nice discharge
[2024-07-05T00:13:59] Yamal: modifications are also cool
[2024-07-05T00:14:29] Yamal: but it is far from the indomitable g30
[2024-07-05T01:17:31] haku: @jamessoderstrom what was that votol vesc hack?
[2024-07-05T01:22:09] Yamal: :)
[2024-07-05T01:39:43] haku: do you know how to wire that? would it work for em260 votol?
[2024-07-05T01:41:22] Patrick: If you want to reset the Vesc yes if not not
[2024-07-05T01:41:33] Patrick: I only do it when i messed up settings before

[2024-07-05T08:43:28] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Hello friends, does anyone have a phone number or some form of contact for a mechanical race, the customer service is terrible, there is no other form of contact other than by email, which takes days and days to respond. I have been waiting for some schul for 4 weeks. Every time they answer me they tell me in a week or more the controllers will arrive this week they tell me they will send them to me it is Friday and I don't have any news from them. They sent me an email on Monday I answered them and I don't have any more answers I don't know if it is The stores are set up in the garage of some neighborhood community but the customer service is terrible or non-existent. I spent ‚Ç¨800 on something that I never know when I will have it.
[2024-07-05T08:45:38] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: To know when they will arrive it is as easy as calling the manufacturer and asking how much they send them. This way the customer is informed and everyone is happy but being with this uncertainty I do not see it as necessary I am not in a hurry as if they told me 4 months let it be 4 months no 8
[2024-07-05T08:48:27] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: On Monday they tell me that the controllers are on the plane but where does that plane from the end of the world come from ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
[2024-07-05T09:42:49] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Cute family

[2024-07-05T09:44:20] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Which 2 wires are those ?
[2024-07-05T09:47:52] 'lekrsu': Where's those beta vesc firmwares I'll allegedly need for G30 dash lisp, for the Ubox Alu lite?
[2024-07-05T09:48:11] Jason: beta fw?
[2024-07-05T09:48:13] Jason: 6.05m
[2024-07-05T09:48:15] Jason: ?
[2024-07-05T09:48:56] 'lekrsu': That's what I heard
[2024-07-05T09:49:12] Jason: never got 6.05 working personally
[2024-07-05T09:49:19] Jason: always ended up on limited mode
[2024-07-05T12:04:42] Patrick: Works with 6.02 too
[2024-07-05T12:05:32] Patrick: But the dash needs a firmware thats supported
[2024-07-05T12:05:57] Patrick: You maybe need to downgrade it
[2024-07-05T12:08:03] 'lekrsu': James said the beta had better support, for e brake etc

[2024-07-05T12:24:29] Mirono escooters: It turned on when you started pushing scooter or something
[2024-07-05T12:25:34] Patrick: Maybe didnt test it with a shitsky i am not really using ebrake at high amps
[2024-07-05T12:26:40] 'lekrsu': tf

[2024-07-05T17:27:14] S: Hi there, I'm trying to run my dashboard with the lisp script. My battery bar is showing but nothing else is working. This is how I soldered:
[2024-07-05T17:27:38] S: I'd only need throttle and ebrake, is there a more "simpler" way to just connect both of these instead of the whole display?
[2024-07-05T17:34:53] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Race Mechanic the translator does what he wants
[2024-07-05T17:35:43] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: What are those connectors ???
[2024-07-05T17:35:46] Yamal: creator of the great "wave", sometimes I think it is hidden in some user of the group,??? I do not think so :(, Vesc is not a mop!!!!! With Vesc you go to work, you go on the road and you free yourself, it saves you from a last-minute situation, you compete and you push your machine to the limit, and all this makes him and his technology great.
[2024-07-05T17:40:35] 'lekrsu': I'm getting this when trying to upload the G30 lisp
[2024-07-05T17:41:25] 'lekrsu': Where's your rx?
[2024-07-05T17:41:36] S: Yea just noticed
[2024-07-05T17:41:58] 'lekrsu': I'm literally doing the same thing right now, just soldered it, but the upload button is messing with me :3
[2024-07-05T17:42:31] 'lekrsu': So line 47 is (import "pkg@://vesc_packages/lib_code_server/code_server.vescpkg" 'code-server)
[2024-07-05T17:44:26] S: Well, soldered it to it but still the same problem as before, only batt percentage showing in bars
[2024-07-05T17:49:00] 'lekrsu': figured it out
[2024-07-05T17:59:00] 'lekrsu': Alright, configured throttle/brake's. In 1zuna's video he enters the main page and just makes it react, but when I press nothing happens. Why?
[2024-07-05T18:00:21] 'lekrsu': Headlight turned itself on once already!
[2024-07-05T18:04:13] 'lekrsu': And it's only spinning in reverse.
[2024-07-05T18:08:40] 'lekrsu': Fixed this part.

[2024-07-05T18:20:29] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: The customer service is terrible, I don't understand that in a store like this they don't have a contact phone number. You can only communicate by email. Well, let's see what they tell us next week, thanks friend.
[2024-07-05T18:24:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because probably even they don't know, so they won't answer you for tjis
[2024-07-05T18:25:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: Shipping from extra UE country is very difficult to manage, specially if is some country like india
[2024-07-05T18:30:02] 'lekrsu': Magically works
[2024-07-05T18:34:56] 'lekrsu': After rebooting the VESC, it's still working, but locking me to 20km/h, as if it was reversed. How do I solve that? I did reverse motor in motor cfg, do I change the lisp to account for it?

[2024-07-05T18:53:03] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Is it normal that they don't respond to emails in a week?
[2024-07-05T18:55:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: Obviously no, but I guess you message he often, so if he don't have updates he wouldn't answer you
[2024-07-05T18:55:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: I'm saying because I was ex owner of store as him, and when you manage large volume of customer is hard to answer everyone the same thing.
[2024-07-05T18:59:33] Lisa: Did you unlock?
[2024-07-05T18:59:41] Lisa: @ESt1ft
[2024-07-05T18:59:47] Lisa: He had same problem I think
[2024-07-05T18:59:59] 'lekrsu': Unlock?
[2024-07-05T19:00:10] Lisa: So Like in secret mode
[2024-07-05T19:00:24] Lisa: Hold gas and brake 2 Times button press
[2024-07-05T19:01:38] 'lekrsu': Can't make change anything
[2024-07-05T19:01:54] 'lekrsu': wait, button huh
[2024-07-05T19:02:16] 'lekrsu': Now it's 6kmh
[2024-07-05T19:02:25] Lisa: You in eco mode?
[2024-07-05T19:02:31] Lisa: It sometimes doesn‚Äôt switch
[2024-07-05T19:02:38] Lisa: You need to press brake good
[2024-07-05T19:02:47] Lisa: When the battery percentage shows at the display it worked
[2024-07-05T19:02:57] 'lekrsu': It's at 0.
[2024-07-05T19:03:32] Lisa: Can you make a video or foto?
[2024-07-05T19:04:21] 'lekrsu': <video_file>
[2024-07-05T19:04:43] Lisa: Now try switching to secret mode
[2024-07-05T19:04:49] Lisa: You need to press button fast
[2024-07-05T19:05:56] 'lekrsu': Spam it?
[2024-07-05T19:05:57] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: I only send you one and wait for the response to contact you again.
[2024-07-05T19:06:02] Lisa: Only 2 times
[2024-07-05T19:06:11] Lisa: Fast 2 times
[2024-07-05T19:06:13] 'lekrsu': max rpm of 7000 doesn't feel right
[2024-07-05T19:06:13] Lisa: The button
[2024-07-05T19:06:22] Lisa: Because you‚Äôre in normal mode
[2024-07-05T19:06:27] Lisa: You need to switch to secret
[2024-07-05T19:07:04] Lisa: Hold brake as hard as possible trottle 100% pressing and then press 2x times fast the button
[2024-07-05T19:07:12] Lisa: Then it beeps I think also
[2024-07-05T19:07:12] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Arne has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-07-05T19:08:10] 'lekrsu': Did brake + button twice, now its in "walk mode" and beeps when I try to spin the wheel.
[2024-07-05T19:09:16] Lisa: üò≠üò≠üò≠
[2024-07-05T19:09:19] Lisa: Press again
[2024-07-05T19:09:26] Lisa: Your in don‚Äôt steal mode haha
[2024-07-05T19:09:44] Lisa: Do it again to get out of ‚ÄûWalk‚Äú mode and do the same with gas!
[2024-07-05T19:09:49] 'lekrsu': 20kmh.
[2024-07-05T19:09:53] Lisa: You forgot the trottle
[2024-07-05T19:10:22] 'lekrsu': I forgot what about the throttle?
[2024-07-05T19:10:59] Lisa: <video_file>
[2024-07-05T19:11:40] 'lekrsu': wtf, thanks
[2024-07-05T19:13:08] 'lekrsu': Alright, so now why's it "slow" to discontinue torque?
[2024-07-05T19:13:29] Lisa: What you mean?
[2024-07-05T19:13:34] Lisa: But did secret mode work?
[2024-07-05T19:14:24] 'lekrsu': <video_file>
[2024-07-05T19:14:44] 'lekrsu': It's like, "sticking" to max speed for a couple seconds.
[2024-07-05T19:14:50] Lisa: That‚Äôs field weakening
[2024-07-05T19:15:00] 'lekrsu': Why's field weakening applied all of the sudden?
[2024-07-05T19:15:18] Lisa: I think that‚Äôs it? Didn‚Äôt you do field weakening?
[2024-07-05T19:15:45] 'lekrsu': No.
[2024-07-05T19:15:51] Lisa: But just try it out at the street
[2024-07-05T19:18:18] 'lekrsu': Can't really do that yet. I've got no mounting.
[2024-07-05T19:18:26] S: Hey there, I need help aswell üòÖ So, when I connect the dash to comm, the dash flashes up and goes out directly?
[2024-07-05T19:20:05] Lisa: ü•≤
[2024-07-05T19:20:18] Lisa: Can you show me your dash wiring?
[2024-07-05T19:21:38] S: <photos/photo_15921@05-07-2024_19-21-38.jpg>
[2024-07-05T19:22:16] S: <photos/photo_15922@05-07-2024_19-22-16.jpg>
[2024-07-05T19:22:17] 'lekrsu': Throttle speed: 60kmh Control speed via app (but now doesn't allow FWD, only RWD, in app?: 50kmh There's 0A field weakening.
[2024-07-05T19:22:18] Lisa: Can you mark me what what cable is
[2024-07-05T19:24:05] S: <photos/photo_15923@05-07-2024_19-24-05.jpg>
[2024-07-05T19:25:06] 'lekrsu': Why'd it work perfectly fine before system reboot? After that it's messy.
[2024-07-05T19:29:16] Lisa: You sure 5V is 5V and maybe not switched?
[2024-07-05T19:29:22] Lisa: Or 3,3V
[2024-07-05T19:29:26] Lisa: Sus
[2024-07-05T19:29:42] S: Very sure yes, red to red is 5V
[2024-07-05T19:29:58] Lisa: 3,3V is also red
[2024-07-05T19:30:26] Lisa: Can you send me the Pinoutv
[2024-07-05T19:31:26] Patrick: Install the script again then turn the scooter off, then on again and go in the unlock mode from the dash and after youre in the unlock remove it
[2024-07-05T19:33:00] 'lekrsu': Remove what?
[2024-07-05T19:33:09] Patrick: The display script
[2024-07-05T19:33:18] Patrick: Then the speed limit is gone
[2024-07-05T19:33:43] 'lekrsu': We can just remove it?
[2024-07-05T19:33:47] Patrick: If you remove it while being in a locked profile with an speedlimit you will be stuck with the limit
[2024-07-05T19:33:55] 'lekrsu': oh
[2024-07-05T19:34:13] Patrick: Idk why but after i git in the unlock and then removed the script it worked again
[2024-07-05T19:34:32] Patrick: For some reason ERPM and everything was setup correctly but the dash script was still somehow active
[2024-07-05T19:35:06] Patrick: Even after flashing the firmware again
[2024-07-05T19:35:30] S: <photos/photo_15924@05-07-2024_19-35-30.jpg>
[2024-07-05T19:35:53] Lisa: Measure resistor
[2024-07-05T19:35:59] Lisa: If it‚Äôs really 1K 2K idk
[2024-07-05T19:36:02] Lisa: 2K also possible
[2024-07-05T19:40:16] 'lekrsu': Guess I'll wipe and redo.
[2024-07-05T19:41:25] Patrick: I dont know the problem didnt have it before but even after flashing the firmware again and removing the dash it was still somehow limiting it
[2024-07-05T19:43:15] 'lekrsu': None of these keybinds was mentioned in the vid nor guide
[2024-07-05T19:44:25] Patrick: Unlock combination?
[2024-07-05T19:45:18] Patrick: Combinations are written down on github and shown in 1 video
[2024-07-05T19:46:09] 'lekrsu': Ok apparently I can't read. Indeed there.
[2024-07-05T20:21:31] 'lekrsu': I see this line in LISP, (def secret-sport-fw 10), why's this even there? I assume (def secret-sport-current 1.0) is a multiplier of current, such as it's "1x", but fw is fixed amount?
[2024-07-05T20:32:26] 'lekrsu': Yes, changed it and uploaded rn
[2024-07-05T20:33:48] 'lekrsu': That's interesting, so VESC has delay with flux? I wonder how it's even implemented in the first place. Also based on STM timers?
[2024-07-05T20:34:42] Patrick: New script? Because i dont see this line in the m365 lisp script
[2024-07-05T20:34:55] 'lekrsu': Oh yes, using the 6.05 ADC branch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m365fw/vesc_m365_dash/6_05_adc/g30_dash.lisp
[2024-07-05T20:35:35] 'lekrsu': In fact, change branch and the guide for resistance is changed to 400-500 something ohms instead in the readme. I've got 1.2k on.
[2024-07-05T20:36:01] Patrick: Never saw it for Xiaomi
[2024-07-05T20:36:08] 'lekrsu': Headlight has triggered a few times. How do I mitigate this?
[2024-07-05T20:36:46] 'lekrsu': I only know of the SHFW impl, not any generic one's. I also suffer from impartial knowledge on this end.
[2024-07-05T20:38:57] Lisa: At GitHub there is a fix
[2024-07-05T20:39:06] Lisa: I think a cap or something
[2024-07-05T20:39:12] Lisa: And another resistor
[2024-07-05T20:39:17] Lisa: 470r or something like this
[2024-07-05T20:39:55] 'lekrsu': Like, resistance shouldn't matter, press is a press as long as we're reducing it from getting random jumps in voltage.
[2024-07-05T20:40:25] 'lekrsu': Cap between 3.3v gnd and 5v gnd, something.
[2024-07-05T20:41:05] 'lekrsu': headlight's causing a vdrop on my hall lines, gonna reduce max a bit. Noticed that idle hall on my brake is higher than a slight press, heh.
[2024-07-05T20:44:51] 'lekrsu': I'm seeing how ADC logic works now, less confusing We do change, then write, then reset apply, check, repeat It is kind of stupid to run sensitive halls on the same line as headlight
[2024-07-05T20:58:24] 'lekrsu': God, I love this shit. Everything seems to be working after those changes I did in the LISP and re-tuning halls. Where do I change this part? For context, it's 20S at what I define to be 70%, 76V charge. I take it range is calculated on wh/km, so in air makes that show stupid values, but what about the percentage?
[2024-07-05T21:01:07] Lisa: I think there is some value on battery tap where you change settings
[2024-07-05T21:01:12] Lisa: Can you send screenshot?
[2024-07-05T21:01:45] 'lekrsu': I can't find any battery tab.
[2024-07-05T21:02:13] Lisa: Sorry meant this
[2024-07-05T21:02:17] 'lekrsu': I've earlier tuned every system to do a linear calculation based on voltage, for mental clarity.
[2024-07-05T21:02:17] Lisa: <photos/photo_15926@05-07-2024_21-02-17.jpg>
[2024-07-05T21:02:24] Lisa: Zuna said one time I believe battery filter constant
[2024-07-05T21:02:32] Lisa: When battery percentage is wrong
[2024-07-05T21:03:42] 'lekrsu': What are these defaults.. what do they even mean? How can start be higher than end?
[2024-07-05T21:09:25] Lisa: Hhahah idk
[2024-07-05T21:12:52] 'lekrsu': Do I change them? I think I understand. does VESC do peak wattage changes based on voltage?
[2024-07-05T21:13:12] 'lekrsu': But it's at 76V atm.
[2024-07-05T21:18:31] 'lekrsu': So we're kind of talking realistic curves instead of linear curves on voltage? Guess it doesn't really matter, I'll keep the current impl
[2024-07-05T21:19:00] 'lekrsu': I'll tune my BMS to show realistic values instead XD, rn it's the span/20
[2024-07-05T21:21:08] 'lekrsu': I've approximated what I believe is my earlier SHFW configuration, are these values sane to use on the G30 motor?
[2024-07-05T21:22:19] 'lekrsu': 35 instead?
[2024-07-05T21:22:32] 'lekrsu': The popup thing tells me "1.5x" but complains under 60A :3
[2024-07-05T21:23:18] 'lekrsu': Oh, max current ain't phase?
[2024-07-05T21:23:44] 'lekrsu': Been doing 20A + fwk, ending up in the 28A batt current mark. Waiting on the second motor though. *where are you*
[2024-07-05T21:23:54] Lisa: Didn‚Äôt know that haha
[2024-07-05T21:24:44] 'lekrsu': Like that?
[2024-07-05T21:26:06] 'lekrsu': ok, dis?
[2024-07-05T21:26:52] 'lekrsu': I've tried out 100A before. My drum is barely functional.
[2024-07-05T21:27:08] 'lekrsu': But the BMS never sees even 20A regen regardless.
[2024-07-05T21:27:44] 'lekrsu': Nah, it's horrible. I hate it.
[2024-07-05T21:28:25] 'lekrsu': so earlier img as final? Gonna mount this somehow.
[2024-07-05T21:31:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: @SibClimb please check this customer
[2024-07-05T21:39:44] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: He told me that he would help me with the configuration but I think that until I send the controllers he will not communicate with me

[2024-07-05T22:38:10] 'lekrsu': Alright, one last thing for now. Throttle works fine as per lisp values, but the control via app, does as the image says.
[2024-07-05T22:38:44] Patrick: Got the same with the m365 script
[2024-07-05T22:39:06] 'lekrsu': Btw, deleting and applying again worked wonders!

[2024-07-06T11:59:20] 'lekrsu': What would cause my e-brake to go like: high high high off low high off? Feels dangerous. Settings üëáüòÅ
[2024-07-06T12:03:14] 'lekrsu': <photos/photo_15939@06-07-2024_12-03-14.jpg>

[2024-07-06T12:53:37] Happy Giraffe: Adjust ebrake to -40A motor current and -8A battery current (you can increase this if it works but battery regen current must be less than BMS maximum allowed charging. Also for a small battery -8A or -10A is about max I would do when mot knowing the cells
[2024-07-06T12:54:29] 'lekrsu': BMS side it's 150A allowed, since regen cut-off is not something I'd want. It's 20s6p of Samsung 32E.
[2024-07-06T12:55:51] 'lekrsu': So is it the settings causing this, or the LISP? I'd prefer if it wasn't the lisp heh :3
[2024-07-06T12:55:52] Happy Giraffe: Then you can try -40A motor and -15A battery regen
[2024-07-06T12:56:15] 'lekrsu': Alright, I'll try that next time. Thanks!
[2024-07-06T12:57:43] Happy Giraffe: Not familiar with lisp but -65A batt regen is too much. Even if it never uses that much it's safer to limit it for a safer braking.
[2024-07-06T15:13:16] Benur Lgl: Slight acceleration to get bread lol
[2024-07-06T15:15:23] Benur Lgl: <video_file>
[2024-07-06T15:27:29] Jan: Looks powerful, how is your cooling solution for the esc?
[2024-07-06T15:34:59] Benur Lgl: Aluminum heat radiator with fins
[2024-07-06T15:45:56] Happy Giraffe: Glad to see someone using brain instead of these stupid little fansüòÇ
[2024-07-06T15:46:30] Happy Giraffe: Alu boxes/radiators are so good. Never got my ubox even 10¬∞c above ambient temperature
[2024-07-06T15:47:04] 'lekrsu': <video_file>
[2024-07-06T15:47:17] 'lekrsu': First actual ride, insanely smooth
[2024-07-06T16:17:05] 'lekrsu': Throttle response is kind of 'smooth', how can we increase the initial acceleration phase?
[2024-07-06T16:18:15] Yamal: You have a plane, let's see if you can share more information for our delight...
[2024-07-06T16:20:50] Benur Lgl: what do you want to know
[2024-07-06T16:21:30] 'lekrsu': Changed the exponential of it, couldn't notice much of a difference
[2024-07-06T16:21:52] Yamal: everything, even the hardness of the last screw that your Nami Viper has...
[2024-07-06T16:21:53] Benur Lgl: <photos/photo_15947@06-07-2024_16-21-53.jpg>
[2024-07-06T16:22:23] Yamal: How do you mount the shull on the heatsink widthwise?
[2024-07-06T16:22:24] 'lekrsu': These I guess
[2024-07-06T16:22:42] Benur Lgl: Mdr Some things stay secret lol
[2024-07-06T16:23:12] Yamal: nothing that can be told man I say it as a joke
[2024-07-06T16:23:15] Benur Lgl: what shell
[2024-07-06T16:23:24] Yamal: Shull controller
[2024-07-06T16:23:34] Benur Lgl: I say
[2024-07-06T16:23:45] Benur Lgl: C350
[2024-07-06T16:24:44] Yamal: Yes ,, I know, you said it when you joined the group, I mean how they are installed, many people are going to start using Shull now, also in Nami
[2024-07-06T16:24:51] 'lekrsu': Changed both to 0, might be placebo but it felt good :c
[2024-07-06T16:25:03] Benur Lgl: The machine comes out about 38500 watts
[2024-07-06T16:25:11] Yamal: Nice
[2024-07-06T16:25:39] Yamal: <photos/photo_15949@06-07-2024_16-25-39.jpg>
[2024-07-06T16:25:57] Benur Lgl: C'est tout le probl√®me de le faire bien j'ai cr√©√© un caisson en inox
[2024-07-06T16:26:21] Benur Lgl: Rien a voir moi quasi etanche
[2024-07-06T16:26:56] Mirono escooters: English!
[2024-07-06T16:27:35] Yamal: You are 20s33/2?
[2024-07-06T16:30:14] Benur Lgl: in 20s 12 p in 33x2 70 speed
[2024-07-06T16:30:36] Benur Lgl: <photos/photo_15950@06-07-2024_16-30-36.jpg>

[2024-07-06T16:30:40] Yamal: Nice 12 p ü§Ø
[2024-07-06T16:30:50] Benur Lgl: Yes
[2024-07-06T16:31:31] Yamal: Your top speed ?
[2024-07-06T16:32:20] Benur Lgl: Taken 150 gps but I think deep 155 160
[2024-07-06T16:33:01] Benur Lgl: 850 amp phases
[2024-07-06T16:33:58] Benur Lgl: My insta skulrider profile_69
[2024-07-06T16:34:09] Yamal: How beautiful, your life is complete so I think now all that's left to do is enjoy it.
[2024-07-06T16:34:38] Benur Lgl: Nothing more to do on it I'm disgusted
[2024-07-06T16:34:58] Yamal: I don't have Instagram, only Telegram but I think that's enough, you have a beautiful machine
[2024-07-06T16:35:30] Benur Lgl: thank you to you what are you riding on
[2024-07-06T16:36:19] Yamal: Nami viper on shaman one ^^
[2024-07-06T16:36:54] Benur Lgl: Shaman One?
[2024-07-06T16:37:23] Yamal: 20s 10p 40T 60h 22/3 Little FOCer That‚Äôs all I thing..
[2024-07-06T16:37:34] 'lekrsu': Makes sense
[2024-07-06T16:37:54] Benur Lgl: Ah yes already great it must work well already
[2024-07-06T16:38:27] Benur Lgl: <photos/photo_15952@06-07-2024_16-38-27.jpg>
[2024-07-06T16:40:16] Yamal: Yes, I am very happy, I have had 19kw with 100A battery and 150A phase, and a top speed of 126 kmh at the moment I do not plan to increase more phase until the summer temperatures drop.
[2024-07-06T16:40:36] Yamal: Bull Nami
[2024-07-06T16:41:58] Benur Lgl: you are right take advantage it's niceüëç
[2024-07-06T16:43:02] Yamal: <photos/photo_15953@06-07-2024_16-43-02.jpg>
[2024-07-06T16:44:21] Yamal: my scooter flies like a butterfly and stings like a bee
[2024-07-06T16:52:58] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: and glides like a dragonfly
[2024-07-06T17:08:50] Yamal: and here sleeping,,,, I also put a heatsink on it and it works very well.
[2024-07-06T17:27:56] Yamal: It looks like a fin to put it in the water
[2024-07-06T17:31:17] Jason: sabvoton?
[2024-07-06T17:32:42] Jason: yes
[2024-07-06T17:32:43] Jason: def
[2024-07-06T17:32:54] Jason: fucked shit up so hard now screw is stuck
[2024-07-06T17:32:55] Jason: <photos/photo_15957@06-07-2024_17-32-55.jpg>
[2024-07-06T17:33:35] Yamal: I definitely see you very serious lately..... :(
[2024-07-06T17:34:51] Jason: Anyway new motor
[2024-07-06T17:35:32] Yamal: Nice
[2024-07-06T17:35:40] Yamal: Type?
[2024-07-06T17:36:13] Jason: wdym?
[2024-07-06T17:36:18] Jason: by the "type"
[2024-07-06T17:36:52] Yamal: Sice magnet, and winding
[2024-07-06T17:36:59] Jason: not sure
[2024-07-06T17:38:20] Jason: oh found
[2024-07-06T17:38:22] Jason: 30h magnet
[2024-07-06T17:38:28] Jason: (12 inch and tight space)
[2024-07-06T17:39:38] Jason: <photos/photo_15959@06-07-2024_17-39-38.jpg>
[2024-07-06T17:39:39] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jason has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-07-06T17:42:51] puneDir: <photos/photo_15907@05-07-2024_13-25-23.jpg>
[2024-07-06T17:43:07] puneDir: Im putting this cheap ass esc until i find money for vesc
[2024-07-06T17:44:59] Yamal: I have kelly 7218s better than this I think‚Ä¶
[2024-07-06T17:45:26] 'lekrsu': timing mismatch go brr
[2024-07-06T17:45:45] 'lekrsu': But it was only 3‚Ç¨ right?
[2024-07-06T17:46:01] Jason: bruh
[2024-07-06T17:46:06] Jason: is that literally
[2024-07-06T17:46:18] Jason: aliexpress 50a controller
[2024-07-06T17:51:09] Yamal: üèç
[2024-07-06T17:54:51] Yamal: In think better than sabvoton?
[2024-07-06T18:00:17] Jan: What thermal paste between everything?
[2024-07-06T18:00:58] Jan: There might be an air gap, no way it would heat that fast in this setup
[2024-07-06T18:01:03] puneDir: Its 3 euro China esc
[2024-07-06T18:01:10] puneDir: yes xd
[2024-07-06T18:01:18] puneDir: YES XD
[2024-07-06T18:02:00] puneDir: 18 mosfet
[2024-07-06T18:02:05] puneDir: It can do 110+ amps
[2024-07-06T18:02:06] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. puneDir has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-07-06T18:02:09] Jason: I have better one
[2024-07-06T18:03:14] Benur Lgl: lol I can't get the right time
[2024-07-06T18:04:21] Jason: <photos/photo_15962@06-07-2024_18-04-21.jpg>
[2024-07-06T18:04:31] Jason: 18 mos
[2024-07-06T18:04:55] Benur Lgl: NTC 10 or NTC 100 but in value beta nothing coherent
[2024-07-06T18:05:36] Benur Lgl: I'm on Vesc
[2024-07-06T18:06:05] Benur Lgl: D√©j√† demand√© il ne sais pas
[2024-07-06T18:06:28] 'lekrsu': Translator? ))
[2024-07-06T18:07:09] Benur Lgl: On shull c 350 false not flashing
[2024-07-06T18:07:32] 'lekrsu': How much temp increase should I expect with the ubox alu lite? Running low thermally conductive 0.5cm thermal pad right now, mostly for testing. If it ends up heating too much, I'll swap to a more efficient one.
[2024-07-06T18:07:33] Benur Lgl: fastriding
[2024-07-06T18:07:39] puneDir: Mines is 18 too
[2024-07-06T18:07:51] Yamal: Mines too
[2024-07-06T18:07:53] Jason: but more compact heh
[2024-07-06T18:08:06] puneDir: Its actually 25
[2024-07-06T18:08:20] Jason: that's 25? quite cheap actuallt
[2024-07-06T18:08:32] puneDir: Yes
[2024-07-06T18:08:35] 'lekrsu': Screwed it down with those metal bands, with foam between that, onto m4 screw holes in chassi
[2024-07-06T18:08:49] 'lekrsu': But any "range" I should look out for?
[2024-07-06T18:08:59] 'lekrsu': Never had an ESC with temps before! xD
[2024-07-06T18:09:52] 'lekrsu': Short one in the general discussion, haven't ridden more rn
[2024-07-06T18:10:03] Benur Lgl: I have to test the resistance to the voltmeter
[2024-07-06T18:10:09] 'lekrsu': 70C.. ;c Guess I'm fine
[2024-07-06T18:10:17] 'lekrsu': Is the temps on mos?
[2024-07-06T18:10:25] 'lekrsu': Alr nice
[2024-07-06T18:11:38] 'lekrsu': Btw, what's this connector for?
[2024-07-06T18:12:56] 'lekrsu': xD
[2024-07-06T18:12:58] 'lekrsu': yeah unmarked
[2024-07-06T18:13:12] Benur Lgl: No overheating in this temperature configuration by driving hard 55 degrees and cooled very quickly
[2024-07-06T18:16:52] Jan: 5mm? Waaaayy to thick
[2024-07-06T18:16:56] Jason: insufficient heat transfer
[2024-07-06T18:17:06] Jason: tbh
[2024-07-06T18:17:12] Jason: I'm using like
[2024-07-06T18:17:13] 'lekrsu': Yess, but wanted something "not so permanent" as paste for testing.
[2024-07-06T18:17:20] Jan: But why
[2024-07-06T18:17:22] Jason: 5mm thick thermal pad
[2024-07-06T18:17:32] Jason: doesn't rly heat that much
[2024-07-06T18:17:34] 'lekrsu': Quite literally expected driving to be optional, so needed to actually drive the vesc.
[2024-07-06T18:17:54] Jason: 5mm thicc thermal paste with Chinese inverter case
[2024-07-06T18:17:55] Jan: You want those pads to be the thinnest possible
[2024-07-06T18:18:03] Jason: ik
[2024-07-06T18:18:11] 'lekrsu': Speaking obvious facts
[2024-07-06T18:18:32] Jan: Yeah but 41¬∞C at 2kW
[2024-07-06T18:18:37] Benur Lgl: I use the Artic Gel very good heat transfer with copper plate under the controllers
[2024-07-06T18:18:53] 'lekrsu': Harder to keep timings close with more mos
[2024-07-06T18:19:16] Jason: <photos/photo_15965@06-07-2024_18-19-16.jpg>
[2024-07-06T18:19:21] Jason: the 2kw pulled esc :
[2024-07-06T18:19:32] 'lekrsu': I'll put in a second vesc when motor n.2 arrives, if postal wouldn't be so lazy it would've already been here.
[2024-07-06T18:19:42] Jason: tbh pulling 3kw still doesn't even exceed 60c
[2024-07-06T18:19:45] Jason: 45 deg
[2024-07-06T18:20:10] Benur Lgl: Be careful when I push longer I go up to 55 degrees but no more
[2024-07-06T18:20:21] Jason: uhhhhhhhhhh
[2024-07-06T18:21:37] Jason: prob fake spec
[2024-07-06T18:23:27] Benur Lgl: no ESC temperature problem for me I have the same temperature rise on the display rage
[2024-07-06T18:27:26] Yamal: Do you have the funtrott fenders?
[2024-07-06T18:30:40] Benur Lgl: What wings?
[2024-07-06T18:31:59] Yamal: mudguard
[2024-07-06T18:37:20] Benur Lgl: Yes fun trott
[2024-07-06T18:37:56] Yamal: great detail....
[2024-07-06T18:40:45] Yamal: Also hope
[2024-07-06T18:42:33] Yamal: The Display from what I saw is very very expensive

[2024-07-06T19:09:49] Jan: Really good overview video for people who dont know Heatpipes
[2024-07-06T19:10:43] Jan: They have a maximum amount of heat (Watt) they can transfer, if you go over it, the transfer collapses
[2024-07-06T20:01:50] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: So leave both on 0.5 ?
[2024-07-06T21:29:36] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Acceleration
[2024-07-06T21:30:29] 'lekrsu': It's just acting as a smooth delay to your throttle curve

[2024-07-07T05:41:11] haku: nice. its dc motor unfortunately. beggars cant be choosers
[2024-07-07T05:41:39] haku: 15mph should be enough for him
[2024-07-07T05:41:43] Noname: Well it's a button throttle also lol
[2024-07-07T05:42:56] Noname: Does he know the difference? Like dad you couldn't even get me a bldc like everyone else.
[2024-07-07T05:43:46] haku: he has to earn it. no freebies here.
[2024-07-07T05:44:19] haku: i will make this run on good lithium ion cells
[2024-07-07T05:46:56] Noname: Batterys dead?
[2024-07-07T05:47:15] haku: no but i think its lead acid
[2024-07-07T05:47:34] Noname: Does it turn on?
[2024-07-07T05:47:54] haku: no.
[2024-07-07T05:48:10] haku: i will open it when i get some time
[2024-07-07T06:06:48] haku: <photos/photo_15971@07-07-2024_06-06-48.jpg>
[2024-07-07T06:17:47] Noname: Lol equivalent of 4 li ion cells
[2024-07-07T06:28:12] haku: if this wont work a flipsky eskate motor and a mini spintend will be cheaper than buying a new one
[2024-07-07T06:28:53] haku: atleast he will be vesced up like the boys
[2024-07-07T06:44:39] haku: thats good to know.
[2024-07-07T06:45:03] haku: how would that work? only 2 phases
[2024-07-07T06:55:14] haku: i dont want him to go fast maybe 10-15mph untill he learns how to balance
[2024-07-07T07:05:36] haku: still runs.
[2024-07-07T07:27:43] haku: gotcha. thanks
[2024-07-07T07:28:23] haku: whats the minimum voltage for spintend 6fet alu pcb?
[2024-07-07T07:40:18] GABE: 7s
[2024-07-07T07:50:19] haku: ill try to run on on vesc tommorow. i fried this dc controller when i pu 18v on it.
[2024-07-07T12:21:26] GABE: what is this for?
[2024-07-07T12:33:06] Jason: prob dc dc buck converter for driving lights and etc

[2024-07-07T14:20:50] GABE: No, there is no brushed 4-6s escs
[2024-07-07T14:20:58] GABE: and if there is, theyre niche and as expensive and brushless can do it anyway, assuming it can be programmed
[2024-07-07T14:21:20] GABE: there are some 4S, but hard to find
[2024-07-07T14:21:53] Forol1561: Ofc there are lol
[2024-07-07T14:21:58] GABE: Do show.
[2024-07-07T14:22:18] Forol1561: Gona find some first lol, what current u pushin
[2024-07-07T14:22:55] GABE: There are 6s traxxas brushed escs which are like expensive as hell lol
[2024-07-07T14:23:03] GABE: not my photo
[2024-07-07T14:23:07] sombre_enfant: U can put brushed on most hobbywing esc for 4-6s....
[2024-07-07T14:23:22] GABE: if programmable sure but most of them are junk and cant be
[2024-07-07T14:23:46] GABE: also AC RC escs are almost as expensive as flipsky which is objectively better
[2024-07-07T14:23:47] Forol1561: Most are programmable lol
[2024-07-07T14:23:54] GABE: ^
[2024-07-07T14:25:32] Forol1561: Also there is like f*ck ton of em since rc cars are a thing
[2024-07-07T14:29:50] Forol1561: Yeah.... From 0.5A to 500A from 1S to 18S there is a LOT to choose from
[2024-07-07T14:33:45] sombre_enfant: Most 1/8 esc are 180/960A its programmable u trippin on fent bro

[2024-07-07T23:18:43] Jan: Copied the base frame from Rion
[2024-07-07T23:19:03] Yamal: Geometry ?
[2024-07-07T23:19:14] Jan: Mediocre
[2024-07-07T23:19:38] Yamal: Maybe better than Nami
[2024-07-07T23:19:46] Jan: 80kmh, one compression and you fly
[2024-07-07T23:20:24] Jan: Nami is actually better as long as nobody stands on it
[2024-07-07T23:20:46] Z P: What motors are you running?
[2024-07-07T23:20:52] Yamal: Compression? hole in the road
[2024-07-07T23:21:37] Yamal: better to sit?
[2024-07-07T23:22:15] Jan: No, the moment you put weight on it, it gets worse
[2024-07-07T23:22:35] Jan: #C-Suspension things
[2024-07-07T23:22:59] NetworkDir: Still nothing can beat with C suspension comfort
[2024-07-07T23:23:12] NetworkDir: Not for high speed but fine max 90km/h
[2024-07-07T23:23:17] Jan: Probably not
[2024-07-07T23:23:23] Yamal: Better iron bars, like some who use them to compete?
[2024-07-07T23:23:30] NetworkDir: Inmotion RS have a C suspension even better gt2 i think
[2024-07-07T23:23:46] NetworkDir: Because design don't allow to shitting trail
[2024-07-07T23:24:07] Jan: Yes inmotion RS is very good steering geometry
[2024-07-07T23:24:18] Rose: Hey there Andy, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-07-07T23:24:49] Yamal: :(
[2024-07-07T23:25:20] Yamal: Nami better throw it away river..?
[2024-07-07T23:25:43] Yamal: 60h/22/3
[2024-07-07T23:26:58] Jan: No, its a perfect offroad & long range scooter base
[2024-07-07T23:27:12] Jan: Make a travel scooter out of it, torque motors to pull stuff etc
[2024-07-07T23:27:21] Jan: Dont make everything a highspeed
[2024-07-07T23:27:52] Jan: And if you still wanna do that, then you would need to get steering damper, else you risk your life.
[2024-07-07T23:28:35] Jan: For highspeed 11inch i think GT2 and Inm. RS are the best frame, however the GT2 requires quite some cnc work to get it going
[2024-07-07T23:29:12] Jan: But you can get a Frame-only version which is quite special
[2024-07-07T23:31:01] Jan: Thr thing is if you build a power scooter, if its only value was performance, nobody will give a shit in 3years as better technology emerges, making the build obsolete
[2024-07-07T23:31:11] Jan: Make something more or different out of it
[2024-07-07T23:31:22] Yamal: thanks for your contribution! I don't touch Nami anymore, maintenance, disc pads, etc., a new steering damper, tires, little else...
[2024-07-07T23:31:39] Jan: My next build is gonna be a 5kW single motor scooter, but its gonna blow anything out of the water, permanently
[2024-07-07T23:31:50] Jan: Also in 10years its gonna be special
[2024-07-07T23:32:13] Jan: There is a couple who made two Long range travel Namis
[2024-07-07T23:32:31] Jan: Like Bag holders everywhere and ultra long range battery
[2024-07-07T23:33:26] Jan: Rion scooter are not special because of their performance
[2024-07-07T23:34:09] Jan: Its the carbon fiber body in Pur Sang finish
[2024-07-07T23:35:12] Jan: Pur Sang finish: The Raw materials only, no paint
[2024-07-07T23:35:49] Yamal: Yes, I know! They are French, they had the Nami Blast for sale after the Lebocoin trip, I wanted to upgrade my scooter, and I got it, I also like the circuits, etc., but this is another story and it takes a lot of money to prepare one, and nothing little more there are no new projects in mind for the future so enjoy what there is
[2024-07-07T23:36:25] Yamal: Why are you talking to me about Rion now Jan?
[2024-07-07T23:36:49] Jan: Ah true you have one right
[2024-07-07T23:36:50] Jan: ?
[2024-07-07T23:36:59] Yamal: No
[2024-07-07T23:37:09] Yamal: I have nami only
[2024-07-07T23:37:34] Jan: Its not always about power and performance
[2024-07-07T23:37:52] Jan: You can make something great out of the Nami
[2024-07-07T23:38:34] Jan: Make a theme
[2024-07-07T23:39:37] Yamal: I don't have the option, otherwise, believe me, especially with the things I've learned in the last year, but I'm forced to change countries, to one where they prohibit scooters in the near future, so nothing.
[2024-07-07T23:40:16] Jan: Where are you going?
[2024-07-07T23:40:39] Yamal: I'm looking forward to trying new frameworks.
[2024-07-07T23:40:44] Yamal: Singapur
[2024-07-07T23:41:00] Jan: E Bikes allowed?
[2024-07-07T23:41:05] Yamal: if everything goes well
[2024-07-07T23:41:20] Yamal: Yea
[2024-07-07T23:41:23] Jan: Example Project: frame: e-bike theme: Tron technologies: Lumilor Paint, EL wires
[2024-07-07T23:41:27] Yamal: But a like scooter ‚Ä¶..
[2024-07-07T23:41:57] Yamal: Fidoo maybe is nice but..
[2024-07-07T23:42:22] Jan: Then attach two fake pedals as axle sliders to the nami, and call it an ebike üòÖ
[2024-07-07T23:42:32] Jan: Then its legal
[2024-07-07T23:43:22] Yamal: those people don't play, believe me, and they are very smart, come on, the 25kmh stickers aren't worth it
[2024-07-07T23:43:47] Yamal: They have their rules and everyone respects them.
[2024-07-07T23:46:07] Yamal: but of course, I don't rule out something with vesc of course! I'm even considering looking for car circuits to be able to ride with a scooter, you can also jump to Malaysia which is literally crossing a road and ride there without a problem with a scooter, there are projects but at the moment I'm here, and I have quite a few months left, so nothing enjoy the nami!
[2024-07-08T00:51:16] haku: its a esc for brushed motor. never seen one before
[2024-07-08T01:18:56] Rose: Hey there Daniel, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-07-08T01:31:16] Z P: Yeah I‚Äôm that not good at breaking down the spec. 60h I got 22/3?
[2024-07-08T02:16:54] Forol1561: U can get a lot less powerfull ones with ease too
[2024-07-08T02:22:28] Noname: Esc lol it's a switch. You look at it yet?
[2024-07-08T02:46:54] haku: not yet. ima open it in a sec
[2024-07-08T02:48:03] haku: all the ports lead to it. charging, throttle, brake lights and on off switch
[2024-07-08T02:48:21] haku: maybe a adc adapter thingy
[2024-07-08T02:51:12] Z P: Out of curiosity what do you have to machine on the GT2?
[2024-07-08T03:11:43] haku: its a controller theres mosfets in this thing.
[2024-07-08T03:13:27] Yamal: I don't understand you,,, 60h is the length of the magnets which is 60mm and 22/3 the type of winding, in this case standard or intermediate
[2024-07-08T03:13:57] haku: what is this.
[2024-07-08T03:25:50] haku: oh. i see. it just does a clicking sound now when i press the throttle. i overvolted it to18v. what component should i replace?
[2024-07-08T03:29:41] haku: i want to play doctor vesclord and fix it
[2024-07-08T03:31:44] haku: ill start with removing chips with my new heatgun
[2024-07-08T03:33:19] haku: laotie bat almost ready. im just finishing this for my boy. his toys come first
[2024-07-08T03:33:49] haku: ill prolly bypass this and wire throttle straight to battery and motor
[2024-07-08T03:46:19] haku: this too big. dam
[2024-07-08T03:49:44] haku: this 5s battery would be great too. might have to ask some favors @jamessoderstrom for some 5s5p holders bud
[2024-07-08T04:02:11] haku: i think it can fit 1 more p. ill be using 18650 panasonic
[2024-07-08T04:02:45] haku: maybe p42 if my boy stops being autistic for a week
[2024-07-08T04:59:54] Forol1561: Just get a cheap 10‚Ç¨ brushed esc.....smaller and better LOL
[2024-07-08T05:05:52] haku: thanks. what do those look like? is there a 18 or 24v version?
[2024-07-08T05:06:51] Forol1561: What are ur needs?
[2024-07-08T05:06:55] Forol1561: From it?
[2024-07-08T05:08:20] haku: just to run a brushed motor at 5s. just want to wire throttle and on/off switch. 12v/24v led would be great but its okay if theres non
[2024-07-08T05:08:43] Forol1561: And current?
[2024-07-08T05:08:56] haku: maybe 20a
[2024-07-08T05:09:47] haku: i shouldve have run this thing on 18v.
[2024-07-08T05:10:50] haku: buy motor looks like it can take it.
[2024-07-08T05:11:00] Forol1561: Ok....... U got a shit ton of options,
[2024-07-08T05:11:24] haku: cool. where to get these?
[2024-07-08T05:12:29] haku: i want the cheapest if possible
[2024-07-08T05:13:24] Forol1561: Go pn aliexpress and search for "6S brushed esc"
[2024-07-08T05:13:56] haku: gotcha thanks bud.
[2024-07-08T05:14:17] Forol1561: Most are sub 10‚Ç¨ with such low demands lol

[2024-07-08T12:39:44] Rose: Hey there SAMMY, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-07-08T12:44:53] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: For nami
[2024-07-08T14:11:19] 'lekrsu': If I'm changing values in G30 dash lisp, e.g. (def secret-sport-fw 10) or (def secret-drive-watts 1500), are these overriding the settings in the motor currents tab of vesctool? And for the fwk, is that adding 10, or overriding to 10? If I have fwk at 20A, switch modes from sport to other, then back to sport, would that now be set to 10, or 30?
[2024-07-08T14:13:50] 'lekrsu': Asking, because (def secret-sport-current 1.0) acts as a multiplier of current, meanwhile (def secret-sport-watts 1500000) is a fixed limit. Not sure what they change on the config side. Anything actually written, or applied live?
[2024-07-08T14:18:04] 'lekrsu': Alright, so I'll have to configure fwk in the lisp to have it permanent, and not foc advanced, I see. Is there anything else interesting to tune or mess around with? So far, just riding with batt being half of phase, 25 & 50A, with zero vector freq set to 40khz. To have it be more 'aggressive' during the early acceleration phase, do we increase both? Should begin to monitor my battery current. Afaik, the full version of the vesctool app is not sent in the beta zip on the website, so I'll connect it through tcp or whatever that was to tune the lisp.
[2024-07-08T14:42:07] Yamal: And I say, really, is using field weakening worth it? I attest that high performance scooters do not use it, it is more from my experience that I tell you that: When I start with the vesc I achieved a maximum speed of 131kmh with a configuration of: -230Ax2 phase -100A battery -35A FWx2. well, it gives me the feeling that now my scooter runs faster than before taking it at only 150A100A btt (same) and without FW, it's amazing, I go over 120kmh with ease and it accelerates hard and what do I mean by this? Maybe on small scooters the FW IS FUN because of its magic, but on large scooters it no longer makes sense to me, that is to say: my skate with battery, motors and controller gives what it gives and that's it and I'm happy with the whip
[2024-07-08T14:43:47] Jason: yes(from what I remember)
[2024-07-08T14:43:52] Jason: it changes
[2024-07-08T14:44:14] Jason: at high current not rly worth it
[2024-07-08T14:44:34] Jason: big scoots use high kv motor with a lot of voltage/w current
[2024-07-08T14:44:46] Jason: for ninebot? Definitely worth the fwk
[2024-07-08T14:44:46] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jason has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-07-08T14:45:08] Yamal: In short, for me FW is not a solution, I doubt I will use it again and if I use it to do some speed tests and then remove it, if everything is safer without FW, everything runs more smoothly, better temperatures, why use it? to gain 10/15kmh? naaaaaaahhhhhhh
[2024-07-08T14:45:29] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: <animation>
[2024-07-08T14:46:00] 'lekrsu': Smaller 30h motors can see an increase at low voltage, lets say 36V, a base speed of 30 km/h but fwk can practically bring that up to 50km/h on roads. Sure, it's inefficient, but it's there.
[2024-07-08T14:53:02] Jason: I gained 20kpm
[2024-07-08T14:53:04] Jason: kph
[2024-07-08T14:53:14] Jason: 40k max with half batt
[2024-07-08T14:53:18] Jason: 60k max with fwk
[2024-07-08T14:53:19] Jason: lmaoooo

[2024-07-08T14:59:56] Ion: Found a 7260R for 1200‚Ç¨ someone is selling. Allegedly had some water damage but battery was replaced. Not really looking to buy it but isn't that quite cheap for what it is?
[2024-07-08T15:01:05] Yamal: Very cheap
[2024-07-08T15:01:37] Yamal: maybe the ad is false
[2024-07-08T15:03:24] Yamal: carries two flags to fight bulls
[2024-07-08T15:04:39] Ion: Yea that's what I think but he wants pickup in person. Also if battery was replaced I don't understand why it's still listed as defective
[2024-07-08T15:06:51] Yamal: In future projects I would like to bet on scooters with good geometry,, It's a pity that there are few, and among them they are neither the prettiest nor the ones with the most room for the battery....

[2024-07-09T10:51:32] Yamal: This morning we had 19¬∞C ambient temperature, and I couldn't resist putting both motors at 200A each, It's really on the way to work and I have little space and a lot of traffic, I was surprised by the peak watts, practically the same as what I had, I think maybe because it didn't achieve too much top speed.
[2024-07-09T10:53:06] Yamal: How many phase amps do you think the Rion motors support?
[2024-07-09T11:11:28] Jan: I think the controller reaches already the maximum at 200-220A phase if i remember correctly.
[2024-07-09T11:13:09] Yamal: Yeah ! For me now 150 A is enough! ^^'

[2024-07-10T01:30:47] Face de Pin Suc√©: Let's see what they give
[2024-07-10T01:32:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: Technically is 3 times better than molicel
[2024-07-10T01:32:38] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes I know
[2024-07-10T01:33:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: But I still don't know if worth , since nobody would be interested to buy it

[2024-07-10T01:40:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: For now it is on hold
[2024-07-10T01:41:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: I'm exploring some more innovation, I don't want to work on known projects
[2024-07-10T01:41:24] Yamal: A video came out with one prepared
[2024-07-10T01:41:51] haku: thats good man. something different. i like it
[2024-07-10T01:42:28] Face de Pin Suc√©: Where ?
[2024-07-10T01:44:57] Yamal: With fastride

[2024-07-10T01:51:43] haku: so tempted to get a flipsky brushless motor. i just dont want it going fast.
[2024-07-10T01:53:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: 3,1 va 9.3 of p42a
[2024-07-10T01:53:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Im going to test p45b on g30
[2024-07-10T01:54:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is normal, also p42a not real 45a
[2024-07-10T01:54:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: It heats af at 25a
[2024-07-10T02:18:03] Z P: Sorry to bother you again but I was googling and wanted to confirm; when you say 22/3 does that refer to 22 gauge wire and 3 phase motor?
[2024-07-10T02:19:57] Noname: Motor + controller + bms + battery. Dude just buy a new kids scooter
[2024-07-10T02:25:44] haku: its cheaper to just fix this. i already have cells and 5sbms.
[2024-07-10T02:26:11] haku: i just want my son to have rich city kids toys. we are poor folk
[2024-07-10T02:26:25] Thierry: It refers to the winding of the stator, 22 wires in parallel and 3 turns. There is also 17/4 (or 16/4, i dont remember), more torque and less speed. A version with less torque and more speed is also available: 33/2.
[2024-07-10T02:27:13] haku: i cant afford a new scoot for him
[2024-07-10T02:28:53] Noname: Finish laiote sell for 175$ buy kids scooter
[2024-07-10T02:29:12] haku: haha
[2024-07-10T02:33:39] Z P: Where can these motors be found?
[2024-07-10T02:38:33] Thierry: I don't know exactly what motor you are referring to but you can most probably buy in Aliexpress.
[2024-07-10T02:47:15] Z P: Got it so it‚Äôs a spec. Does the gauge of the wire matter much? Or is there a standard gauge? I apologize for asking so many questions I just have a thirst for information as I have embarked on a journey that I did not intend to get this far üòÖ
[2024-07-10T04:00:11] Forol1561: Exept fpv drones LOL

[2024-07-10T07:05:25] haku: anything for my boy. hes good boy

[2024-07-10T08:32:56] Jason: (but it's 72v lmao)
[2024-07-10T08:52:07] Yamal: Yesterday at 9 pm,, still hot.. sorry BV, I know you are not in the group, but I also know that when information is shared about your time clocks, there is something in you that is activated xD
[2024-07-10T08:56:08] Yamal: Tonight I'm going to try to do the acceleration vs top speed test at 200A phase,,,

[2024-07-10T09:14:45] Yamal: By the way, for the test, do you prefer that I use GPS App screen recording, and then share total data from the application, or directly screen recording Vesc tool,,?
[2024-07-10T09:14:45] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-07-10T09:17:54] Jason: it survived
[2024-07-10T09:18:22] Yamal: Good
[2024-07-10T11:00:18] 'lekrsu': Beautiful
[2024-07-10T11:00:47] 'lekrsu': This could also work if one'd want more strips across, I believe
[2024-07-10T11:01:47] 'lekrsu': Just slightly longer
[2024-07-10T11:02:31] 'lekrsu': Unless the layout is specific to bms fitting, of course.
[2024-07-10T11:33:38] Yamal: 2500‚Ç¨..
[2024-07-10T11:34:56] Yamal: 1790‚Ç¨..
[2024-07-10T11:39:12] Rose: Hey there –ó–æ—Ä–æ –ô–æ—Ç—Å–∫–∏–π, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-07-10T11:42:49] Jan: Super cheap
[2024-07-10T11:43:12] Jan: Switzerland was already 3000‚Ç¨ for a Vsett 10+ 25.6Ah
[2024-07-10T11:48:02] Jan: GT2, if you wanna build something, you would need a cnc to mill out the left rail. Then it allows for quite some battery packs. Also the axle dropout is kinda very small and not easy to adapt (the rear is even worse as it is one cast aluminum U-block) If you really want some hardcore big 11inch motors, GT2 gives you quite the challenge. But its exceptionally stable at high speeds
[2024-07-10T11:49:11] Jan: RS, steering geometry wise looks very stable too, however i have never ridden one nor seen one live, so no clue how it actually is
[2024-07-10T12:17:41] Rose: Hey there Tom, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-07-10T12:31:20] haku: is that layout that paolo has very tight on a g30?
[2024-07-10T12:47:16] FreehandZ: Yes it's a very tight fit without rails in all of the original deck space in a G30
[2024-07-10T12:47:26] FreehandZ: You need an extension for anything else
[2024-07-10T12:52:11] 'lekrsu': 11cm left, including bms on the long of batt.
[2024-07-10T14:06:33] GABE: yooo guys Jiabada 50a 17s bms came in like less than a week!!! its so small its adorable
[2024-07-10T14:06:37] GABE: and copper
[2024-07-10T14:08:51] GABE: omg i forgot to buy nickel strip, goddamnit.

[2024-07-10T15:05:45] Chen Simhony: How are they working so far? Do you recommend?
[2024-07-10T15:11:54] GABE: 17s6p LG Xiaomi pro 2 with 40h 33x2 (i think thats the winding)
[2024-07-10T15:12:26] GABE: Will have 3s7p external, so i can go 20s if i want to. And Spintend 80v100a.
[2024-07-10T15:19:58] Yamal: 20 s pro 2 nice
[2024-07-10T15:20:26] Yamal: 70h still waiting.. :(
[2024-07-10T15:26:01] GABE: Few weeks till i start getting paid full time.

[2024-07-10T15:44:41] Yamal: What do you really need to finish the g30 custom?
[2024-07-10T16:03:49] GABE: 80 molis, 2x vescs (guy who has them in posession isnt responding), PMT's, and MT5 Brakes.
[2024-07-10T16:04:42] GABE: Not a whole lot, but if i dont get those vescs back, then this project is down the drain even further.
[2024-07-10T16:04:54] GABE: Im worried i wont get them back.
[2024-07-10T16:11:18] Jan: Who?

[2024-07-10T18:17:42] puneDir: I want too
[2024-07-10T18:18:26] haku: this one is a ali brand called kingroon. the clear one is overture petg but its a bit brittle
[2024-07-10T18:19:41] GABE: What is max continious discharge current for LG M26?
[2024-07-10T18:19:53] GABE: @jamessoderstrom specsheet says 10a, this cant be.
[2024-07-10T18:19:57] GABE: that is way too much.
[2024-07-10T18:20:06] GABE: I need it to make my ebike stock.
[2024-07-10T18:20:17] GABE: Stock ebike controller is 20a
[2024-07-10T18:20:20] GABE: with 6p
[2024-07-10T18:20:23] GABE: thats around 3a per cell
[2024-07-10T18:20:41] GABE: Cool, and ill save the good cells from the ebike to put into the pro 2.
[2024-07-10T18:20:55] GABE: those good cells dont deserve to be in that ebike.
[2024-07-10T18:20:57] GABE: at all
[2024-07-10T18:21:05] GABE: ill rearrange them and put in pro 2.
[2024-07-10T18:21:09] GABE: 17s bms arrived today
[2024-07-10T18:21:22] haku: the overture one. but thers a manual preset you have to input.
[2024-07-10T18:27:12] haku: i have too look for it. but these are the samples.
[2024-07-10T18:27:13] haku: <photos/photo_16035@10-07-2024_18-27-13.jpg>
[2024-07-10T18:27:43] haku: its not really transparent.
[2024-07-10T18:28:17] haku: unless its a really thin layer
[2024-07-10T19:04:24] Yamal: If you have the vesc tool app open and connected to the esc but you have the gps app as the main one on your mobile, does it also record the data?
[2024-07-10T19:12:45] Rose: Hey there Arman, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-07-10T19:44:45] 'lekrsu': You've made this look so clean üòÅ
[2024-07-10T20:33:25] haku: its 3mm. you have to print it slowly on a preset or it will look like this lol.
[2024-07-10T20:34:03] Face de Pin Suc√©: https://www.instagram.com/p/C9QHAY1Mu-s/?igsh=MTRqcjR1dWEwM3Nkag== Hello guys, this is Racing Week for all Rage Mechanics team, with a new pilot in light -38Kg escooter with a completely new preparation of +20000W, and also our Surron driver is going to a e track day with his 30 000W Sur-Ron ‚ö†Ô∏è
[2024-07-10T20:36:16] haku: these are your holders printend normally. first thin layer still transparent.
[2024-07-10T20:41:16] puneDir: 8-9a i say
[2024-07-10T20:41:21] puneDir: Not heating up much
[2024-07-10T20:46:58] haku: show the sur ron papi
[2024-07-10T21:14:51] Patrick: Is there a datasheet to the EVE INR21700-50E? I cant find one
[2024-07-10T21:15:05] Patrick: I want to know the lifetime of the cells
[2024-07-10T21:55:38] Face de Pin Suc√©: You'll see saturday
[2024-07-10T22:15:19] haku: why is spintend selling both these
[2024-07-10T22:15:19] haku: <photos/photo_16039@10-07-2024_22-15-19.jpg>
[2024-07-10T22:28:11] Patrick: How thin?
[2024-07-10T22:31:56] haku: i forgot how thin. its paper thin the insulator rings. james made this.
[2024-07-10T22:32:38] haku: i think .2 maybe
[2024-07-10T22:41:15] Mirono escooters: Left absolute sgit
[2024-07-10T22:51:14] haku: i thought they are phasing those out.
[2024-07-10T22:57:46] 'lekrsu': oh my god, evemall.com has music on their cell listings

[2024-07-10T23:11:51] 'lekrsu': They're 6‚Ç¨ cheaper, sale üí∏
[2024-07-10T23:12:46] Mirono escooters: XD
[2024-07-10T23:19:02] haku: would this run on 18v nominal? or i have to make 6s battery?
[2024-07-10T23:21:05] haku: i was going to use 80/100 on a 5s scooter but ill save it for his ebike
[2024-07-10T23:23:44] GABE: Unsure.
[2024-07-10T23:24:05] GABE: should be sold for 50.
[2024-07-10T23:24:54] Lisa: I should be billionaire if we‚Äôre at it
[2024-07-10T23:25:19] GABE: me aswell
[2024-07-10T23:27:25] GABE: there should be no issues with resistance if i cut up copper into nickel strip sizes, right?
[2024-07-10T23:27:59] GABE: i need my fucking 800w
[2024-07-10T23:28:03] GABE: holy shit
[2024-07-10T23:30:21] GABE: theres no fucking way ill be getting that shit back it seems, its so fucking gone guys. Its so fucking over
[2024-07-10T23:30:22] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-07-10T23:31:47] haku: you still have your 70h?
[2024-07-10T23:32:35] haku: its non of my buissness but give it some time
[2024-07-10T23:32:38] GABE: Yes, but the g30 wont be running anytime soon.
[2024-07-10T23:52:42] Yamal: If you have the vesc tool app open and connected to the esc but you have the gps app as the main one on your mobile, does it also record the data?
[2024-07-11T00:19:36] haku: so this is where the rocks in the road is coming from. https://youtube.com/shorts/RR6N2QKF8pQ?si=G4VjkyrH7D_mEcZ6
[2024-07-11T00:27:48] 'lekrsu': wtf thats horrible
[2024-07-11T00:28:40] 'lekrsu': The vesctool app has recorded data while locked and in my pocket the last few days, seems to work.
[2024-07-11T00:34:38] Yamal: https://youtu.be/J7iWttRkbwU?si=fWAC5sia2swSL8FK
[2024-07-11T00:35:04] Yamal: Speed test coming soon üòÇüíÉ
[2024-07-11T00:37:19] Yamal: For me, what Vesc Tool offers is more important than the GPS application, but well this time I will do it with GPS and I will try to record the data with vesc tool in the background
[2024-07-11T00:38:06] Yamal: 200A phase, 28¬∞C ambient
[2024-07-11T00:41:35] haku: works at 18v heck yea.
[2024-07-11T00:55:41] haku: we going to pimp his little scooter.
[2024-07-11T00:55:42] haku: <photos/photo_16041@11-07-2024_00-55-42.jpg>
[2024-07-11T00:57:11] Yamal: Creatine heheh
[2024-07-11T01:00:57] haku: actually this headlights are better. fits the whole handlebar
[2024-07-11T01:03:07] Yamal: Better a more compact light, right? to attach that light to the entire length of the handlebar,,?
[2024-07-11T01:07:04] haku: yea. unfortunately i just shorted the small LED light i just posted. do you know how to fix that?
[2024-07-11T01:08:36] Yamal: No idea bro sorry..
[2024-07-11T01:20:04] NetworkDir: Which one
[2024-07-11T01:34:41] Yamal: 120 Gps,happy but crazy torque üòÇüëç
[2024-07-11T01:35:43] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-07-11T01:54:49] haku: this
[2024-07-11T01:55:20] haku: i touched the + and - while on the power supply
[2024-07-11T02:02:56] Yamal: Is the swiss part the ragemechanic team?
[2024-07-11T04:27:27] haku: this pretty cool. everything bolts on. no weldimg. https://youtu.be/2zrpMY-vVlw?si=X8YkSLKJeYD2nSrq
[2024-07-11T05:17:15] Noname: Is that stock controller?
[2024-07-11T05:23:04] haku: no. i got an 24v one
[2024-07-11T05:23:53] Noname: Ah didn't see it lol. So has adjustable throttle now, nice
[2024-07-11T05:24:33] haku: no same button throttle but i might use my old trigger throttle
[2024-07-11T05:24:50] Noname: I'll send you a spiny v1
[2024-07-11T05:25:33] haku: thanks man but i think that wouldnt work with dumb brushed esc
[2024-07-11T05:26:38] Noname: Need an old drill. Attach finger throttle to bars lol
[2024-07-11T05:27:37] haku: my boy got small hands like me
[2024-07-11T05:27:40] haku: i might use this one. but idk if its 5v
[2024-07-11T05:45:32] Franchesco Carofano: How is Yamal doing with his jewel?
[2024-07-11T06:40:58] Yamal: very good, very happy brother! happy to be the owner of the best wave, perhaps it is not produced by the best sea or ocean, but we are learning and enjoying a lot, little by little everything comes!
[2024-07-11T07:06:06] Z P: 10s
[2024-07-11T07:59:44] Yamal: Way to work
[2024-07-11T08:21:49] Yamal: SHARE DATA, SHARE DATA !!!
[2024-07-11T08:21:57] Yamal: ^^
[2024-07-11T08:41:19] Rose: Hey there M1210, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-07-11T09:05:40] Rose: Hey there tAyFunN, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-07-11T10:27:38] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, Thibaud is now a Rage Mechanics driver
[2024-07-11T11:01:06] Yamal: Which frame on -38kg?
[2024-07-11T11:20:00] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/pP14oEad7KQ?si=DcKnhnrk4cKPvb07
[2024-07-11T11:27:27] Yamal: Woyoyoy the king is in tha hood! ^^'
[2024-07-11T11:32:41] 'lekrsu': Some things shouldn't be built üòÅ
[2024-07-11T11:39:34] Yamal: The truth is that I observe and observe, and where we don't find Vesc the most is in longboard type electric skateboards and in one wheel
[2024-07-11T11:40:10] Yamal: Would these be "these", Vesc's crib?
[2024-07-11T11:41:00] 'lekrsu': <photos/photo_16048@11-07-2024_11-41-00.jpg>
[2024-07-11T11:41:00] 'lekrsu': 48 mosfets
[2024-07-11T11:41:34] Yamal: Wouhhh
[2024-07-11T11:41:48] Yamal: Link, price !!!
[2024-07-11T11:41:54] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-07-11T11:42:19] 'lekrsu': I did some calculations on this thing yesterday. As ali listing shows, that is actually max voltage on charger, not nominal. It only makes sense for this thing to run 40S4P. 50S cells are 5Ah, so they're calculating wh with 3.7V (?!), 40*5*4*3.7= 2960 wh.
[2024-07-11T11:42:19] 'lekrsu': <photos/photo_16050@11-07-2024_11-42-19.jpg>
[2024-07-11T11:44:49] 'lekrsu': It's not running VESC firmware I think haha
[2024-07-11T12:29:19] FreehandZ: Some of those MOSFETs are crooked, and the timing...
[2024-07-11T12:29:37] FreehandZ: That's a shame. I still need to learn how to design ESCs
[2024-07-11T12:39:43] NetworkDir: this power looks very high for EUC ;D
[2024-07-11T12:42:26] NetworkDir: easily can reach 110-120km/h
[2024-07-11T12:42:36] NetworkDir: also have a FWK :D
[2024-07-11T12:43:13] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/IEAY8sF0pAc?si=U-YRBGIKV2plR5uj
[2024-07-11T12:57:26] FreehandZ: damn 50s
[2024-07-11T13:02:37] Finn: Samsung 50s
[2024-07-11T13:03:00] Finn: 40s series config
[2024-07-11T13:04:15] NetworkDir: Looks 40s4p
[2024-07-11T13:04:55] NetworkDir: With samsung 50s and 4parallel max cont current should 140A
[2024-07-11T13:05:17] NetworkDir: For 140A battery current 48 mosfet? XD
[2024-07-11T13:05:39] NetworkDir: 12 mosfet vesc easily can handle
[2024-07-11T13:18:09] Jan: A 50S controller at 1200A is 250kW and then using 4.5kW max power, lmao
[2024-07-11T13:33:17] FreehandZ: Ah
[2024-07-11T13:33:28] puneDir: <photos/photo_16052@11-07-2024_13-33-28.jpg>
[2024-07-11T13:33:43] FreehandZ: Timing would be terrible
[2024-07-11T13:33:48] FreehandZ: Or very hard to keep
[2024-07-11T13:35:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: Dualtron Compact
[2024-07-11T13:36:25] Yamal: The one is ready , purple / yellow, or the new one ?
[2024-07-11T13:37:37] Patrick: Cant read anything on the side

[2024-07-11T13:40:14] 'lekrsu': Wait 3C huh, same as Samsung's 50E?

[2024-07-11T13:44:30] Patrick: 1A only
[2024-07-11T13:45:26] 'lekrsu': Yeah, can't find any long cycle stats
[2024-07-11T14:30:12] Yamal: Don't be shy, show us the scooters better, man! XD
[2024-07-11T14:31:28] Yamal: You can see there are 2 heatsinks, ?? hehe
[2024-07-11T14:39:40] Yamal: Say hello to the Swiss! tell him he has a fan in Spain That kid started with a series ultra on the circuits... and everyone was already going crazy!
[2024-07-11T14:46:00] Chen Simhony: which one ? and why :)

[2024-07-11T15:25:52] Patrick: I bought it and i am crying daily because detection is so ass
[2024-07-11T15:26:01] Patrick: Buy an ubox 85150
[2024-07-11T15:26:09] Patrick: Or the ubox lite
[2024-07-11T15:26:09] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Patrick has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-07-11T15:31:21] Patrick: Whats about this seven is it released already? Looks pretty decent from the pcb
[2024-07-11T15:34:09] Yamal: no idea bro, foc forever is lost...
[2024-07-11T16:32:15] haku: are you in US?
[2024-07-11T16:38:16] haku: these NY guys top notch at ebike game.
[2024-07-11T16:42:35] Yamal: Nice look frame man..
[2024-07-11T16:46:29] haku: yea. its fabricated fido. would be cooler if dual motor
[2024-07-11T16:47:14] haku: these guys always doing fancy stuff.
[2024-07-11T16:48:17] haku: i would love somithing like that
[2024-07-11T16:54:02] Yamal: üòé
[2024-07-11T17:03:58] Yamal: Maybe you can fine Fidoo frame cheap in some where
[2024-07-11T17:05:29] Yamal: You have Molicel, spintend and 70hI don't know if your motors can be put on the type of wheels that Fidoo has. I think so.
[2024-07-11T17:05:46] haku: yes. but that one is not a fiido anymore. its wider and longer.
[2024-07-11T17:05:57] Yamal: Yes..

[2024-07-11T17:33:30] haku: thats pretty good. 39c is minimum here. at 3 it will be 47c
[2024-07-11T17:43:01] Yamal: 47..
[2024-07-11T17:45:32] Yamal: air conditioning and fan all day I imagine
[2024-07-11T17:49:21] Yamal: But I didn't know, it's hotter than the Emirates or Mauritania right now.
[2024-07-11T17:52:00] Yamal: It is clear that Las Vegas is not a place to visit in summer.
[2024-07-11T18:00:00] haku: if your into pool dayclubs. its not bad. but too old for that now
[2024-07-11T18:00:41] haku: fall and spring and winter are the scooter season here

[2024-07-11T22:42:02] puneDir: Probably better than 75100

[2024-07-11T22:42:36] puneDir: You short 2 wires and it makes motor detection
[2024-07-11T22:46:00] 'lekrsu': What would I change to stop the motor from getting 'stuck' at 0rpm+ when trying to reverse? Spamming works to get it going.
[2024-07-11T22:46:24] haku: whats the brand? sabvoton 72100?

[2024-07-12T01:26:17] Z P: Is the motor spinning in reverse?
[2024-07-12T01:27:37] 'lekrsu': It's spinning in the correct orient.
[2024-07-12T01:28:11] 'lekrsu': Probably just some param stopping it from seamlessly doing rev.

[2024-07-13T04:51:33] Rogerio Figueiredo: No error
[2024-07-13T04:51:41] Rogerio Figueiredo: I have to escs

[2024-07-13T05:00:09] Thierry: On smart BMS app?
[2024-07-13T05:01:25] Thierry: If antenna only touched the frame, this is not an issue.
[2024-07-13T05:01:51] Thierry: However it should not be in contact with any supply voltage
[2024-07-13T05:04:26] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yes
[2024-07-13T05:05:02] Rogerio Figueiredo: I tried Bluetooth in the other controller give a error of firmware not detected and blue light doesn't come on
[2024-07-13T05:20:53] Thierry: Try to invert rx and TX of bluetooth module
[2024-07-13T05:21:11] Rogerio Figueiredo: I confirm that
[2024-07-13T05:21:22] Rogerio Figueiredo: And is right order
[2024-07-13T05:21:53] Rogerio Figueiredo: Also the Bluetooth is getting to hot just by being on and is nor normal
[2024-07-13T05:22:24] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is possible to fix the 3.3v line of flipksy 75100 no pcb version
[2024-07-13T05:23:33] Rogerio Figueiredo: No burned fets it had to be trough Bluetooth I don't have sure seams a bit odd but is makerbase

[2024-07-13T05:24:26] Thierry: Did you check 12v 5v 3.3v?
[2024-07-13T05:25:42] Thierry: Does led turn on if you dint connect bluetooth?
[2024-07-13T05:26:25] Rogerio Figueiredo: Not yet I don't have my multimeter here but tomorrow I test it
[2024-07-13T05:28:06] Rogerio Figueiredo: I think so not sure but what I remebrer yes. But Bluetooth apear on phone simple give the error saying that can't feed firmware and usually that is a rx TX problem since is same esc and I just change the cable I doubt it and check tx is on tx and ex is on rx
[2024-07-13T05:28:26] Rogerio Figueiredo: But if was burned should turn on the Bluetooth
[2024-07-13T05:30:23] Thierry: Better to double check and measure with multimeter when you have acces to it
[2024-07-13T05:31:52] Rogerio Figueiredo: But the esc doesn't turn on the blue light so the 3.3v line √© fried
[2024-07-13T05:39:01] Thierry: Try to contact them, even on Facebook if you don't have their WhatsApp.
[2024-07-13T06:12:34] haku: i have purchased from them before. but its on ali chat. ill ask them

[2024-07-13T12:46:39] Hackintoshhhh: Jrev 65H Balance
[2024-07-13T12:47:27] GABE: 17+7s???
[2024-07-13T12:47:31] Hackintoshhhh: Once 40TG are back I‚Äôll make another 10S 150A 40TG
[2024-07-13T12:47:40] Hackintoshhhh: No 10S+7S
[2024-07-13T12:47:41] GABE: ahhhh
[2024-07-13T12:47:57] GABE: just make it all into one pack if theyre all 30TG 2170
[2024-07-13T12:48:04] GABE: ?
[2024-07-13T12:48:11] Hackintoshhhh: Bruv m365 shitbox frame
[2024-07-13T12:48:19] Hackintoshhhh: Non pro
[2024-07-13T12:48:19] GABE: Wire it as one cell.
[2024-07-13T12:48:44] GABE: i have a pro 2 frame, but post to poland is.... cancer
[2024-07-13T12:48:55] Hackintoshhhh: Hell nah certainly not doing balance thru stem
[2024-07-13T12:49:08] Hackintoshhhh: My whole setup won‚Äôt make sense on pro2
[2024-07-13T12:49:15] FreehandZ: That's a bit low :/
[2024-07-13T12:49:25] GABE: you need the full 150a
[2024-07-13T12:49:28] GABE: period lmfao
[2024-07-13T12:49:30] GABE: for the 65h
[2024-07-13T12:49:37] Hackintoshhhh: I know
[2024-07-13T12:49:37] FreehandZ: ~200a is fine
[2024-07-13T12:49:58] GABE: so you want 1:1 internal and ext batt
[2024-07-13T12:50:00] GABE: 10s+10s
[2024-07-13T12:50:08] FreehandZ: Is my next upgrade being 65h motors a good idea with 60a batt lol
[2024-07-13T12:50:13] FreehandZ: Not anytime soon tho
[2024-07-13T12:50:34] GABE: Hah, thats like.. no... maybe for 45h or smth
[2024-07-13T12:50:46] FreehandZ: Buying 65h first then battery
[2024-07-13T12:50:51] FreehandZ: Or battery first then 65h
[2024-07-13T12:51:07] FreehandZ: Dual motor too lol
[2024-07-13T12:51:12] Yamal: <photos/photo_16092@13-07-2024_12-51-12.jpg>
[2024-07-13T12:52:04] GABE: 20S @ 50a isnt enough to even get an 800w motor warm really
[2024-07-13T12:52:06] GABE: and thats like 40h
[2024-07-13T12:52:13] Hackintoshhhh: That‚Äôs the plan
[2024-07-13T12:52:21] GABE: ive tried.
[2024-07-13T12:52:26] FreehandZ: It's enough to saturate a g30 gen 1 motor alone
[2024-07-13T12:52:29] FreehandZ: But I have 2
[2024-07-13T12:52:33] FreehandZ: So 30a each
[2024-07-13T12:52:47] FreehandZ: 30h
[2024-07-13T12:53:08] GABE: 2kw per motor? sure, shouldnt even overheat lmfao. i pushed 2kw cont on 300w for weeks with single, sure it burned but it was super resilient.
[2024-07-13T12:53:27] FreehandZ: They can take 3.5kw but a little toasty
[2024-07-13T12:53:29] FreehandZ: Only peak
[2024-07-13T12:53:32] FreehandZ: Not continuous
[2024-07-13T12:53:43] GABE: dont even peak that much unless you have a sensor
[2024-07-13T12:53:51] FreehandZ: I have hand
[2024-07-13T12:53:54] GABE: No.
[2024-07-13T12:54:10] GABE: Outside can be ''hot'' but inside can be melting.
[2024-07-13T12:54:30] FreehandZ: Coils look perfect even after riding with fwk and it being hot enough to burn me instantly on the housing
[2024-07-13T12:54:32] GABE: Even if it burns ur hand, thats 100c, but safe for all inside.
[2024-07-13T12:54:38] GABE: As in
[2024-07-13T12:54:44] GABE: you think its 100c cause ur hand told ya
[2024-07-13T12:54:46] GABE: but inside is 150
[2024-07-13T12:54:47] FreehandZ: I know, for peak numbers no good to feel housing
[2024-07-13T12:54:56] FreehandZ: Continuous is better to feel housing as heat has time to travel
[2024-07-13T12:55:11] FreehandZ: Still, sensor is better
[2024-07-13T12:55:34] FreehandZ: Burns happen above 50c
[2024-07-13T12:55:41] GABE: Was about to say.
[2024-07-13T12:55:51] GABE: which is funny, because arent some countries 50c?
[2024-07-13T12:55:54] GABE: makes no sense to me....
[2024-07-13T12:55:58] FreehandZ: Air temp?
[2024-07-13T12:55:58] GABE: Maybe the air?
[2024-07-13T12:56:02] GABE: Yee
[2024-07-13T12:56:06] FreehandZ: Your body temp is ~37 degrees
[2024-07-13T12:56:09] GABE: it still seems like it should kill tho
[2024-07-13T12:56:14] FreehandZ: The only way you are cooling down is evaporation
[2024-07-13T12:56:16] FreehandZ: Via sweat
[2024-07-13T12:56:25] FreehandZ: No radiation
[2024-07-13T12:56:29] Hackintoshhhh: I just can say i am shitting bricks on 65H 74A
[2024-07-13T12:56:30] FreehandZ: Since air is hotter
[2024-07-13T12:56:40] FreehandZ: Can you try 30a for me please?
[2024-07-13T12:56:41] GABE: radiation only if in a cold country
[2024-07-13T12:56:44] Hackintoshhhh: Once you slightly touch the throttle
[2024-07-13T12:56:50] Hackintoshhhh: Yeah why not
[2024-07-13T12:56:59] Hackintoshhhh: Torque should be fine on 30a
[2024-07-13T12:57:17] FreehandZ: Yeah I'd still like a real test, just to decide battery pack or motors first
[2024-07-13T12:57:22] Hackintoshhhh: You are GONE
[2024-07-13T12:57:33] Hackintoshhhh: The pole bends insanely hard
[2024-07-13T12:57:43] Hackintoshhhh: And one flies off thr scooter
[2024-07-13T12:57:52] FreehandZ: You ain't supposed to be pulling on the handlebars! But you need a step on the back for that
[2024-07-13T12:58:06] GABE: Time to make
[2024-07-13T12:58:07] Hackintoshhhh: Im not that‚Äôs the point
[2024-07-13T12:58:13] Hackintoshhhh: I‚Äôm just holding it
[2024-07-13T12:58:17] Hackintoshhhh: Slightly
[2024-07-13T12:58:18] FreehandZ: Just ping me, preferably discord as I check there more often
[2024-07-13T12:58:27] FreehandZ: Just too insane ü§£
[2024-07-13T12:58:41] Hackintoshhhh: That has 3 speeds
[2024-07-13T12:58:42] Hackintoshhhh: Here
[2024-07-13T12:58:44] Hackintoshhhh: There

[2024-07-13T12:58:53] FreehandZ: Hey you stole that
[2024-07-13T12:58:59] FreehandZ: Definitely not original
[2024-07-13T13:02:16] Hackintoshhhh: I did
[2024-07-13T13:02:21] Hackintoshhhh: But it‚Äôs true
[2024-07-13T13:05:41] haku: looks like southen california. lots of trees there are planted by spanish missionaries. they are not native trees
[2024-07-13T13:28:53] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: Where I live there are no trees but there are boats üòé

[2024-07-13T21:34:06] haku: join turkish airforce and study to be a pilot.
[2024-07-13T21:34:19] Jan: Yes
[2024-07-13T21:34:31] Jan: My father was a jet pilot in the airforce
[2024-07-13T21:35:03] Jan: Military is a harder in the selection and you will suffer medical injuries at 40+ but for sure an exciting career
[2024-07-13T21:35:59] haku: thats the best way to be a pilot. also military pilots will always have a job after service
[2024-07-13T21:36:41] Jan: You can also just study aviation and become a pilot for civil applications, its a lot easier
[2024-07-13T21:37:04] Jan: Switzerland the selection is hard, he was 9 of 3000
[2024-07-13T21:37:13] haku: true but expensive. military will pay for it
[2024-07-13T21:38:04] Jan: In switzerland you can start at Swiss Airlines and slowly payback the 90k‚Ç¨ over your paychecks
[2024-07-13T21:38:25] haku: thats cool.

[2024-07-14T04:41:59] Noname: Not a Trumper but prob the least worst choice we have.
[2024-07-14T04:53:49] haku: presidential race is getting crazy. its embarassing. need to be preped for the end of days. its coming
[2024-07-14T04:59:16] Noname: Yeah start a garden to feed yourself
[2024-07-14T05:01:27] haku: i need to move for that. maybe utah mountains. las vegas will be a bunch of canibals. nothing grows here
[2024-07-14T05:15:46] Noname: Can't move if they shut down chargers.
[2024-07-14T05:17:15] haku: haha true. need solar chargers
[2024-07-14T05:22:50] Noname: Think I'm about done with Escooters. Mabey keep something around for bike path trips or whatever but need to find a better group. Sitting duck in traffic, range anxiety and the waiting to charge kinda killed it for me. Think I want this and a mini sailboat still lol
[2024-07-14T05:28:38] haku: eew gas
[2024-07-14T05:28:50] Noname: Eeew charging
[2024-07-14T05:29:14] haku: just do short trips.

[2024-07-14T05:30:51] Noname: We're so different. The quiet is nice but no sale
[2024-07-14T05:31:52] haku: maybe battery tech is still at infancy.
[2024-07-14T05:32:50] haku: i love trump and all but the future i see is electric.
[2024-07-14T05:34:26] haku: ev tech will only get better. and im already impressed with tesla tech
[2024-07-14T05:35:25] Noname: Well cars can work with 300mi range. I'm still in favor of hybrid over elec if I had to choose. It just doesn't work with small vehicles yet.
[2024-07-14T05:36:18] Noname: There's just not enough time in a day with 14mph average speed
[2024-07-14T05:37:01] Noname: Lack of chargers, detours for chargers and sitting in the sun for hours waiting.
[2024-07-14T05:41:16] haku: thats true. have to plan your route with evs. but you never pay for gas though
[2024-07-14T05:41:42] haku: if you have a solar setup that would be better too.
[2024-07-14T05:42:30] Noname: Don't care. Cost of the equipment exceeds gas on short term payment. Take decades to get a roi
[2024-07-14T05:43:53] haku: true. but right now you get bonuses with elecrtric like riding in pathways and stuff. not anoying to others
[2024-07-14T05:44:56] Noname: So planning an 80mi ride tmrw. That's about 6 hours elec. 2hr by petrol cost 2$. Losing 4hrs to enjoy nature. Yeah I'd keep a scoot but prob a modded g30. People on bike paths hate us.
[2024-07-14T05:45:03] haku: i think once ev laws come. it will be a huge change in ev market. specially china imports
[2024-07-14T05:45:45] haku: i just like the tech. its so simple
[2024-07-14T05:46:08] Noname: Here there's no room for bike lanes. It's mostly taking a chance with your life lol.
[2024-07-14T05:46:25] haku: same haha. need to ride with traffic
[2024-07-14T05:46:44] haku: well sell me your niu then hehe
[2024-07-14T05:47:16] haku: you can fit 100miles worth of batteries in there
[2024-07-14T05:47:31] Noname: Yeah at the cost of 1k$
[2024-07-14T05:48:00] haku: buy on sale
[2024-07-14T05:48:40] haku: same thing with internal combustion. upgrades cost $$
[2024-07-14T05:48:51] Noname: I could have bought 2 honda scooters for the amount of "E" debt I've created üòÜ
[2024-07-14T05:49:30] haku: true. funny how electric cost more
[2024-07-14T05:49:58] Noname: Why upgrade it does 60+ range for days it's a slower 160cc and need to realize that. I could just buy a street bike etc if I wanted fast
[2024-07-14T05:50:12] haku: i remember my 4 cylinder honda had $$ of upgrades and swaps too.
[2024-07-14T05:50:50] haku: not a good investment. well do what you enjoy
[2024-07-14T05:50:52] Noname: Just modding personality how it goes
[2024-07-14T05:51:30] Noname: Not saying I can afford it but gonna try for next year
[2024-07-14T05:51:53] haku: get something with good resale value like a harley
[2024-07-14T05:52:21] Noname: I wouldn't take one for free
[2024-07-14T05:52:26] haku: or a honda motocompo haha
[2024-07-14T05:52:45] haku: the gas one from the 80s
[2024-07-14T05:53:53] Noname: Those are sales marketing collector items. Nothing that great. Like a Swiss army knife it does everything but sucks at all of it

[2024-07-14T13:27:39] Patrick: It is fully in
[2024-07-14T13:45:51] Yamal: Hello people ! How long do you think it takes for a battery to charge from 0-100%, a 20s10p with a 20 A charger?
[2024-07-14T13:46:45] Yamal: because I was charging at 10A there, the math didn't work out, the BMS gave more charging time than expected...
[2024-07-14T13:59:08] FreehandZ: Can't help if you don't give capacity
[2024-07-14T13:59:28] FreehandZ: Last half hour will probably charge very slow for balancing
[2024-07-14T13:59:36] FreehandZ: Slow anyways to protect cells
[2024-07-14T14:02:23] 'lekrsu': What's the Ah
[2024-07-14T14:03:13] 'lekrsu': It's simply Ah (capacity)/A (charger) = h (hours). You'll see actual given A by charger on any smart bms.
[2024-07-14T14:05:12] sombre_enfant: @Mirono_escooters hi what crimps u use for phase for 6 awg ? Its for the stealth bomber if u have ali link
[2024-07-14T14:07:05] Yamal: 20s 10 p Samsung 40t,,(40 ah)?
[2024-07-14T14:08:47] Yamal: 20A for 10p of 40t is safe, right? They are 2A per parallel..
[2024-07-14T14:14:11] Jan: Needs to be a custom build, but yes for sure engineering nightmare material
[2024-07-14T14:15:25] Jan: The Quickmath (A*h)/A=h
[2024-07-14T14:19:31] sombre_enfant: Makerbase ftw
[2024-07-14T14:25:03] 'lekrsu': Yes
[2024-07-14T14:25:29] 'lekrsu': Needs a time unit, otherwise there's no capacity.
[2024-07-14T14:27:27] 'lekrsu': Do you have a data sheet we can look at?
[2024-07-14T14:27:49] Yamal: Data sheet of cell?
[2024-07-14T14:28:58] Yamal: https://www.dnkpower.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SAMSUNG-INR21700-40T-Datasheet.pdf
[2024-07-14T14:30:21] Yamal: Nice to see ^^'
[2024-07-14T14:31:00] 'lekrsu': Says rated up to 6A per cell.
[2024-07-14T14:31:47] Yamal: but 6A would not be safe I think, maybe it would be the top of the pile...
[2024-07-14T14:31:55] 'lekrsu': So then you have 10*6A, 60A rated charging.
[2024-07-14T14:32:06] NetworkDir: Actually i put 0.005 shunts and changed firmware for correct read now working fine my EUC xD

[2024-07-14T14:34:28] 'lekrsu': You're planning on charging at 20A, then each cell in that 10P configuration will indeed see 2A. That's a third of the rated charge. That is fine according to the data sheet.
[2024-07-14T14:52:19] Mirono escooters: Hi I send latur alieexpress

[2024-07-14T18:32:34] Finn: 20s with ebrake, 22s without
[2024-07-14T18:35:46] Smart Repair: for the speed mode brake+gas+2x button. Do you know how to get back to standard mode? by turning it off and on?
[2024-07-14T18:46:08] 'lekrsu': Turning the dash off will indeed bring it back to that mode, as well as when entering lock (brake + button*2), and back.
[2024-07-14T18:46:36] 'lekrsu': Button will be unresponsive when speed is above defined speed. Default is 1 km/h. Otherwise it'll trigger randomly during ride.

[2024-07-14T20:35:58] Yamal: cleaning the partner
[2024-07-14T20:43:34] 'lekrsu': You need to apply flux separately anyway
[2024-07-14T20:43:50] 'lekrsu': knife tip is easiest for xt's
[2024-07-14T20:44:07] 'lekrsu': good 60w irons are more than enough

[2024-07-14T20:54:59] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Some Ali express shit
[2024-07-14T20:55:33] 'lekrsu': If you've never soldered connectors before, then it can be a bit tricky regardless.

[2024-07-15T17:17:46] Patrick: I prefer my cutoff at 3V per cell some even use 2.8-2.85V per cell, but at least at 2.5V you should cutoff do not drop below
[2024-07-15T17:46:50] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: I would say 2.5

[2024-07-15T22:04:46] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Mksesc 75200 v2
[2024-07-15T22:19:43] Yamal: It seems like it has Hope brakes on the back one, it really can't brake well..?
[2024-07-15T22:22:00] Yamal: In short, bad luck, but everything within the competition, now those are the scratches in the chassis must bother...
[2024-07-15T22:23:12] Yamal: "I go flying, I come flying,, along the way I entertain myself,"
[2024-07-15T22:28:52] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: The pilot in front of you crashes with the bad luck that the rear pilot is very close to the front pilot with the incombenent who has very few meters of reaction, there is the accident that is my opinion
[2024-07-15T22:32:48] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: 51 on standby is wrong
[2024-07-15T22:33:13] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Temp motor

[2024-07-16T00:22:10] Hackintoshhhh: Is there anything you can say about it from the pcb design?
[2024-07-16T00:24:36] Forol1561: Ok guys...... I need help figuring out if I would even be able to use more than 4-8KW

[2024-07-16T00:25:12] Forol1561: But the torque is what I'm after

[2024-07-16T00:43:05] Smart Repair: can you give me the link to this page. either I'm blind or stupid üôà
[2024-07-16T00:43:28] 'lekrsu': Make an account at https://vesc-project.com/ and buy the software for 0‚Ç¨.

[2024-07-16T00:44:57] Smart Repair: I have an account and bought the desktop version for 0‚Ç¨. Now I am looking for the mobile app for Android smartphone
[2024-07-16T00:45:08] 'lekrsu': Talking generally, in the world of VESC? You can obviously use more.
[2024-07-16T00:45:25] 'lekrsu': https://vesc-project.com/user/me/purchased-files
[2024-07-16T00:45:39] 'lekrsu': Apks are in the zips.
[2024-07-16T00:47:16] Forol1561: The thing Is I almost got swayed away doin 20KW max g2 ....... But then I stopped to think how much power would I really use
[2024-07-16T00:47:56] Hackintoshhhh: I don‚Äôt feel like a pill makes much sense and it‚Äôs expensive
[2024-07-16T00:48:14] Hackintoshhhh: I like logic like little focer
[2024-07-16T00:48:19] Hackintoshhhh: One board

[2024-07-16T00:49:56] Forol1561: U see I'm kinda stuck here cause I don't wana go too low but I don't wana go too much of an overkill either
[2024-07-16T00:50:39] 'lekrsu': Start low and go higher
[2024-07-16T00:50:55] Forol1561: That would be a waste of money
[2024-07-16T00:51:06] 'lekrsu': The journey is the fun part
[2024-07-16T00:51:31] Forol1561: Yea.... But still
[2024-07-16T00:51:36] 'lekrsu': Just going 20S instead of 10S is a huge jump, comparatively.
[2024-07-16T00:52:19] Forol1561: Well the thing is..... I need to decide now to future proof the vesc and the battery.....
[2024-07-16T00:53:23] Forol1561: It would be the difference between a ubox lite and ubox 150A or samsung 50S vs overpriced molicel
[2024-07-16T00:55:08] Forol1561: That's why I would start single motor
[2024-07-16T00:55:25] Forol1561: I just don't know what motor to choose lol
[2024-07-16T00:55:53] Forol1561: Jrev 10KW torque seems a bit much tbh ü§£

[2024-07-16T10:21:04] puneDir: Its not the same

[2024-07-16T10:21:15] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: And I have lights and more things that I want to turn off
[2024-07-16T10:21:25] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Why how is it different?
[2024-07-16T10:24:59] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Also don't really care if vesc stay on
[2024-07-16T10:25:08] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Care about the rest of the system
[2024-07-16T10:25:38] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I'll try bms

[2024-07-16T14:55:48] crimeware: I plan smth
[2024-07-16T15:02:26] Jan: Its really just how you make the throttle curve so you dont backflip everytime
[2024-07-16T15:04:31] Noname: And they also sell my j1772 adapter for 100$ or so and Ali has them for 30$. No friends in business
[2024-07-16T15:05:19] Noname: OK so they marked them down to 70$
[2024-07-16T15:18:14] Forol1561: Nah backflippin everytime seems fun..... Kay fck it ima gettin THAT motor lol
[2024-07-16T15:18:58] Forol1561: How much can the ubox lite technically do? If it has sufficient cooling
[2024-07-16T15:19:54] Forol1561: Like amps

[2024-07-16T16:52:42] haku: that 16s 5p 50e not even smart bms. do people really pay that amount of money for batteries?
[2024-07-16T16:54:41] Yamal: How can it be more powerful than the Shull or the same phase at x12 and it is flsky
[2024-07-16T16:56:21] Yamal: how interesting it would be cool to see you work ( üê¨ )
[2024-07-16T17:14:17] Noname: Now subtract 300 for a spot welder - 100 for a car battery - for supply's etc. Doesn't seem that bad if you can't build
[2024-07-16T17:24:37] haku: true.
[2024-07-16T17:26:27] haku: no wonder the 20s powerful lithium batteries can go up to 3grand.
[2024-07-16T17:27:09] 'lekrsu': You pay for the builder's time, that's it.
[2024-07-16T17:28:00] 'lekrsu': If you do it yourself, the payment is a fully functional battery

[2024-07-16T17:30:22] Yamal: Batteries as a general rule in stores, very very expensive, what's more! And let's not talk about whether they have high discharge batteries.. much more
[2024-07-16T17:30:33] haku: only battery maker i trust is lord james

[2024-07-16T17:32:13] haku: i wonder how much 22s22p p42 will cost from manufacturers
[2024-07-16T17:32:20] Mirono escooters: 1400‚Ç¨ wtf
[2024-07-16T17:32:31] Mirono escooters: For such a tiny pcb thing üò± Scares me
[2024-07-16T17:32:44] Yamal: To give you an idea, someone who makes batteries here, which is quite good, charges ‚Ç¨1300 for a 20s10p from p42a.
[2024-07-16T17:33:12] haku: thats not bad.
[2024-07-16T17:33:35] haku: america prices just inflated
[2024-07-16T17:34:03] NetworkDir: For this specs looks fine xD
[2024-07-16T17:34:42] NetworkDir: Works with IGBT?
[2024-07-16T17:35:14] Mirono escooters: Yes but so expensive
[2024-07-16T17:35:32] haku: whos gonna try the 30 fet.
[2024-07-16T17:36:26] NetworkDir: 100kW power xD
[2024-07-16T17:38:30] 'lekrsu': They look sexy tho
[2024-07-16T17:40:16] GABE: who has a 300w motor for cheap?
[2024-07-16T17:40:20] GABE: or 250w.
[2024-07-16T17:44:48] haku: can LY scooter motors handle 32s 15p p42?
[2024-07-16T17:45:24] haku: or need big boy bike motors for that much voltage
[2024-07-16T17:47:51] Oreo huzky: Is the quality on 75350 same as the other flipsky vesc?
[2024-07-16T17:49:29] Oreo huzky: Put it on Xiaomi 1s
[2024-07-16T17:52:23] Mirono escooters: Yes it's good shit but thinking you spend so much for such a tiny t hing üò±
[2024-07-16T17:53:55] haku: its priced fair. a little more than fardrivers. paying for vesc software
[2024-07-16T18:00:30] Smart Repair: Has anyone here ever worked with the g2 ESC from Ninebot? I'm looking for how the current measurement works in order to manipulate it. I hope this topic is allowed in the off-topic area
[2024-07-16T18:01:07] Smart Repair: I have a 450W g2 engine
[2024-07-16T18:01:22] GABE: shunts
[2024-07-16T18:06:02] Smart Repair: unsuccessful... the shunts directly at the input do not bring about any change. A measurement must be made somewhere
[2024-07-16T18:08:13] Unknown: Single
[2024-07-16T18:08:37] 'lekrsu': What are you trying to do and how are you verifying it?
[2024-07-16T18:09:04] Unknown: So what the absolute means? Leta say if i push 250a battery 450a phase How much i got to write on absolute? Thanks
[2024-07-16T18:15:23] Smart Repair: the controller limits the current to a maximum of 44A. I would like to adjust the current measurement to 60A. Unfortunately there is no software solution for the controller that allows more
[2024-07-16T18:16:06] 'lekrsu': Using the stock battery won't give you more than 40A.
[2024-07-16T18:21:00] Yamal: With shull no need flispky xD
[2024-07-16T18:23:04] Smart Repair: not Stock battery. 17s 60A bms

[2024-07-16T20:12:14] Jan: Built in the scooter?
[2024-07-16T20:15:03] puneDir: E bike
[2024-07-16T20:16:25] haku: get the 32s seven vesc and make a 32s pack
[2024-07-16T20:16:49] Jan: No space for much cooling, i dont know, i wouldnt use them so hard when they have that much resistance
[2024-07-16T20:17:10] puneDir: Theyre m26s
[2024-07-16T20:17:16] puneDir: Mostly gray
[2024-07-16T20:17:23] puneDir: 20p shouldnt have much resistance
[2024-07-16T20:17:24] Jan: Battery cooling solutions are expensive
[2024-07-16T20:17:42] puneDir: No cooling is bad for 60+ km rides
[2024-07-16T20:17:43] Jan: And complicated
[2024-07-16T20:18:05] puneDir: I want to go to some other city nonstop with 100-120kmh
[2024-07-16T20:18:05] Jan: Easiest is thermal pad it to a aluminum plate that is in airstream
[2024-07-16T20:18:23] Jan: Yeah that wont work with that cooling
[2024-07-16T20:18:36] puneDir: Maybe with 70-80kmh possible
[2024-07-16T20:18:46] Jan: Either you need bigger batteries so the cells are not loaded that much or you have an active cooling
[2024-07-16T20:18:59] puneDir: 20s20p is the max i can fit
[2024-07-16T20:19:03] puneDir: Not even sure will it fit
[2024-07-16T20:19:30] 'lekrsu': You're not using all the possible amps right?
[2024-07-16T20:19:33] puneDir: No
[2024-07-16T20:19:39] puneDir: 200a max with that cells
[2024-07-16T20:19:45] puneDir: Planning on 180-160 or so
[2024-07-16T20:19:56] 'lekrsu': Use less and no cooling needed üòÅ
[2024-07-16T20:20:17] puneDir: yes but wouldnt it be slow with 10kw?
[2024-07-16T20:20:23] puneDir: Quite heavy frame
[2024-07-16T20:20:30] puneDir: Around 50kg bare frame
[2024-07-16T20:20:35] 'lekrsu': some datasheet have awesome over-time temp data
[2024-07-16T20:20:46] puneDir: With m26?
[2024-07-16T20:21:02] 'lekrsu': Haven't checked that specifically
[2024-07-16T20:21:10] 'lekrsu': Gonna go & ride now üòÅ

[2024-07-16T22:38:37] haku: i might just buy the rack amd make my own basket
[2024-07-16T22:57:23] Yamal: It depends on whether I go on the road or not... but with work involved it's lazier
[2024-07-16T22:58:04] haku: whats the weather there like?

[2024-07-16T23:40:49] Yamal: Translator‚Ä¶.
[2024-07-16T23:43:53] Yamal: I'm saying that the daily kilometers I do depend on whether I leave after route work or not, since during the week it becomes more difficult because of the own work that takes up time, then come home, cook, rest, organize the house a little etc etc he time here, summer! It's hot every day, so now with the scooter it's fine first thing in the morning and at night.
[2024-07-16T23:45:09] Yamal: 77,7
[2024-07-16T23:58:18] haku: do you drive scooter to work?

[2024-07-17T12:36:20] haku: ok. so higher the voltage the more torque and speed yea?
[2024-07-17T12:36:57] 'lekrsu': Motors with lower kV has more torque, but won't spin as fast.
[2024-07-17T12:37:25] 'lekrsu': Giving a motor more voltage won't inherently increase the torque, and it'll only affect the speed.
[2024-07-17T12:38:36] haku: so you mean 22x3 gets hotter with higher voltage and 33x2 wont when ran at 150v
[2024-07-17T12:39:00] 'lekrsu': What :/
[2024-07-17T12:39:20] haku: lets say 360a ea motor
[2024-07-17T12:41:28] haku: whats a better motor winding for high voltage like 32s
[2024-07-17T12:45:28] Yamal: ‚ù§Ô∏èüßê
[2024-07-17T12:45:52] 'lekrsu': A motor with low enough kV to provide you high torque while still allowing your desired speed.
[2024-07-17T12:47:53] 'lekrsu': v = speed V = voltage kV = motors speed constant in rpm/volt D = rotor diameter in mm
[2024-07-17T12:48:24] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: For people who have an understanding of the 75 sires of mks how is the 75200 v2 better then the v1 and is it noticeable
[2024-07-17T12:48:28] haku: jeebus. i cant solve that
[2024-07-17T12:48:45] 'lekrsu': Divide by (60*1000) to not have speeds in mm
[2024-07-17T12:48:56] Patrick: 45‚Ç¨ cheap enough? But wait youre not from germany right?
[2024-07-17T12:49:00] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I wonder this because I have both but don't know what to use on the rear what to use on front
[2024-07-17T12:53:23] haku: ill let bro science decide if i burn my motors running it at 32s.. im not good at equations
[2024-07-17T12:54:46] 'lekrsu': kV has nothing to do with if it survives any voltage or not. Purely rpm/voltage ratio.
[2024-07-17T12:56:06] 'lekrsu': This formula might be incorrect
[2024-07-17T12:56:51] 'lekrsu': Lets approximate. What's your wheel diameter, voltage and kV?
[2024-07-17T12:57:07] haku: ill ask gandalf james to explain it to me in hobbit language
[2024-07-17T12:57:42] haku: its a small scooter motor. 6.5 inch
[2024-07-17T12:57:54] 'lekrsu': That says nothing about how fast it spins
[2024-07-17T12:58:40] haku: lets say 13inch wheels idk whats that in mm
[2024-07-17T12:59:16] 'lekrsu': kV is a spec we can calculate by measuring RPM on a motor at any given voltage, without load.
[2024-07-17T12:59:54] haku: im just decidimg if its a good idea. scooter motors are small. you think it will burn it
[2024-07-17T13:00:16] haku: if you push 150v 350a per motor
[2024-07-17T13:00:54] 'lekrsu': You can do: speed (km/h) = kV * voltage * tire diameter (cm) * 0.001886 Or move the terms around to approximate kV rather than speed.
[2024-07-17T13:02:07] haku: i dont want top speed. im just wondering if the motor can handle that when watts spike up.
[2024-07-17T13:02:12] 'lekrsu': Let's take my motor for example. It has a kV ratio of 18.9. This allows it, at the very peak, to spin at ~60km/h if the voltage is 72V (counting in v-drop, so voltage motor gets).
[2024-07-17T13:02:40] 'lekrsu': No matter how many amps you give it, it wont go faster.
[2024-07-17T13:03:06] Jan: You cant use cheeseburger units, has to be SI
[2024-07-17T13:03:13] 'lekrsu': If you'd rewind the same motor to spin twice as fast, aka double the kV, then you'd have significantly less torque. Does that make sense?
[2024-07-17T13:03:19] haku: i know this.
[2024-07-17T13:03:41] haku: yes. thanks
[2024-07-17T13:03:47] 'lekrsu': The formula died
[2024-07-17T13:04:53] haku: but higher voltage low amps are more efficient then low voltage high amps yea?
[2024-07-17T13:05:06] 'lekrsu': Having a motor that can spin to 200kmh, but you're going 50kmh, that just leaves unused performance on the table. Rather go for a lower kV motor then.
[2024-07-17T13:05:43] 'lekrsu': Talking about the same motor in both scenarios? Then you'll accelerate slower with less amps.
[2024-07-17T13:06:59] haku: thanks for the answers bud. i need to sleep on it and rethink my descisions
[2024-07-17T13:08:07] 'lekrsu': Definitely already feeling the torque difference between sub 16kV and 18.9kV.
[2024-07-17T13:09:25] Jan: Its incomplete
[2024-07-17T13:09:37] Jan: At the same amps yes
[2024-07-17T13:09:59] 'lekrsu': Of course. Why would we change the current given when comparing this?
[2024-07-17T13:10:00] Jan: If you can compensate with more amps on the higher KV, you dont loose torque
[2024-07-17T13:10:22] 'lekrsu': That mentality only works well on bigger motors.
[2024-07-17T13:10:51] 'lekrsu': You'll then need a battery & esc to survive the current requirements.
[2024-07-17T13:10:58] Jan: My motors have 45KV, the torque is really ok with 300-400A phase per motor
[2024-07-17T13:11:30] Jan: With lower KV you loose quite a lot of topspeed
[2024-07-17T13:11:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: Only because you are 10inch
[2024-07-17T13:11:44] Jan: Find the optimal KV so that you dont need FW
[2024-07-17T13:11:51] 'lekrsu': They're huge motors. My 30h's can't survive high amps. Going 35A batt & 65A phase.
[2024-07-17T13:11:55] Jan: Or just little fw
[2024-07-17T13:12:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: If you were 11inch, wouldn't have enough torque with that KV :/
[2024-07-17T13:12:03] 'lekrsu': Oh definitely. Fwk is so inefficient.
[2024-07-17T13:12:38] Jan: I think a delta star switch would be better
[2024-07-17T13:12:45] 'lekrsu': That's why I try to tell people to not go around building 36V packs to apply insane amounts of fwk. "But speed is speed" is all some can think of.
[2024-07-17T13:13:37] 'lekrsu': 36V + fwk is just so inherently slow at 45 km/h, if the base speed w/o is 30 km/h.
[2024-07-17T13:15:31] 'lekrsu': Or these small Xiaomi 25h motors. 22kV range, batteries can only supply 20-30A (with insane v-drop still). They should've produced higher torque motors, considering they're sold to be used at 25 km/h.
[2024-07-17T13:17:45] 'lekrsu': What kind of speeds and kV values are we talking about?
[2024-07-17T13:21:17] 'lekrsu': Oh, the 'allegedly working condition' G30 battery from an auction might've arrived at a store nearby. Should go & pick it up and see if it works, üëÄ. Or it's the inner stator of a G30 Gen 1, the tracking system won't tell me. üëÅÔ∏è
[2024-07-17T13:21:17] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 'lekrsu' has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-07-17T13:25:54] haku: reason im asking because i have 500 p42s and a 70h 33x2 unused. i have a minibike frame coming to use it on. the seven 18fet seems like a good vesc. idk
[2024-07-17T13:27:05] 'lekrsu': If you can supply the amps to run a high kV motor at high amps, then go for it.
[2024-07-17T13:27:18] Jan: Sub 20kV is quite terrible for high topspeeds
[2024-07-17T13:27:46] 'lekrsu': Sub 70km/h territory
[2024-07-17T13:40:18] 'lekrsu': What's your rotor diameter, 10-12", 72v? At 45kV I'm assuming 150-185km/h range. Is the high bemf from lower kV motor at its peak rpm causing issues otherwise?
[2024-07-17T13:42:04] 'lekrsu': Haven't driven bigger than 30h motors, so I'm curious üòÅ
[2024-07-17T13:42:49] Yamal: It would be something nice to do, to be able to ride a scooter with speed motors
[2024-07-17T13:44:12] Jan: 10inch 65H 72V yes its about in that range of speed
[2024-07-17T13:44:49] Jan: 7mOhm resistance
[2024-07-17T13:46:36] 'lekrsu': Ubox auto detection detected 64 mŒ© and 81 mŒ© from my motors
[2024-07-17T13:47:16] Noname: @Bradhaku my 60v vs a k6 it's fast not warp speed fast but can definitely run away from me. I'd say they're torque motors with double the voltage. Top speed with new update is like 70mph. Things to consider though, can you fit 32s? Is it worth it, cost of parts etc.
[2024-07-17T13:48:56] haku: 32s 15p will fit if i fill all the compartments i think.
[2024-07-17T13:49:23] haku: all i need is the frame and the 32s vesc.
[2024-07-17T13:50:04] 'lekrsu': Going double pack or a single 32s bms?
[2024-07-17T13:50:49] haku: depends. bms 32s bms only goes 150a
[2024-07-17T13:51:24] haku: bypass would be cool but not so smart i think
[2024-07-17T13:52:26] 'lekrsu': Don't bypass dischargeü´•
[2024-07-17T13:52:45] haku: anyways back to bed for me and need to dream about it. i need visions from my shaman
[2024-07-17T13:53:00] Noname: 5am
[2024-07-17T13:53:42] Noname: Nvmnd I'm tired lol 5am is not 5pm lol
[2024-07-17T13:53:45] 'lekrsu': Ant has some high rated 30S BMS now, don't they?
[2024-07-17T13:54:06] haku: <photos/photo_16146@17-07-2024_00-40-18.jpg>

[2024-07-17T14:11:53] FreehandZ: Force at the ground is what changes when tire size changes, right?
[2024-07-17T14:14:41] FreehandZ: Torque remains the same, assuming the same motor and current
[2024-07-17T14:19:32] 'lekrsu': Torque at the wheel changes with wheel size.
[2024-07-17T14:20:47] 'lekrsu': But the motor torque remains the same.
[2024-07-17T14:42:27] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: so no performance change

[2024-07-17T19:02:49] Happy Giraffe: Shitposters have got vescs on their hands nowadays. We are doomed
[2024-07-17T19:07:25] haku: incredible. no voltage drop
[2024-07-17T19:07:44] Yamal: Your bike has to be scary. vesc power and brakes hope!
[2024-07-17T19:11:29] Happy Giraffe: It's the most power you can have in legal setup (1000w motor etc)
[2024-07-17T19:14:24] haku: your a law abiding citizen. please move to america

[2024-07-17T20:58:11] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: If I discharge MOSFETs and a short happens after what will happen?
[2024-07-17T20:58:26] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: @Fjskfjs
[2024-07-17T21:00:00] Happy Giraffe: That means just the bms is outputting power? It will give sparks ofcourse
[2024-07-17T21:00:13] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Want to solder xt90s to it should I just shutdown bms
[2024-07-17T21:00:20] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: So no good
[2024-07-17T21:01:04] Happy Giraffe: If you turn the mosfet off then it should be ok, be careful cutting, soldering and insulating one cable at a time a you will be good
[2024-07-17T21:01:49] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I'll shut down bms and see if it still outputs power
[2024-07-17T21:22:07] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Shutdown bms resulted in multimeter reading 56v of 60v battery
[2024-07-17T21:22:59] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Instead of 67 when on
[2024-07-17T21:23:04] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: *62
[2024-07-17T21:32:56] Mirono escooters: Yeah just floating voltage
[2024-07-17T21:33:10] Mirono escooters: Put any load over it it goes to 0
[2024-07-17T21:33:11] Happy Giraffe: Just cut one cable at a time and keep other insulated, you will be good
[2024-07-17T21:33:56] Happy Giraffe: When one of cables is finished then do the other. Then they cant really touch each other

[2024-07-17T22:38:13] GABE: better not to do it tho
[2024-07-17T22:40:06] GABE: just wire 2x 16s BMS, with X amps, and 2 chargers.
[2024-07-17T22:40:15] GABE: discharge through main line
[2024-07-17T22:40:15] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-07-17T22:59:59] puneDir: Time to put bazillion amps to motor
[2024-07-17T23:01:25] haku: whats the radiator for? watercooling?
[2024-07-17T23:01:57] Finn: I would guess cooling for the esc
[2024-07-17T23:06:12] puneDir: Esc + motor watercooling
[2024-07-17T23:06:16] puneDir: Also the motor
[2024-07-17T23:07:32] puneDir: Anybody has 18650 holder 3d models?

[2024-07-18T00:02:45] GABE: Why not? if anything itll heat up less, Also 32s isnt enough for real arcing, i think.
[2024-07-18T00:02:56] GABE: only about 120v.
[2024-07-18T00:04:25] GABE: it is physically impossible for it to arc unless the windings are already about to blow, which negates everything
[2024-07-18T00:05:17] GABE: 1000v per millimeter, just checked.

[2024-07-18T11:23:00] crimeware: anyone here has a ubox lite?
[2024-07-18T11:23:08] crimeware: I need some mesurments
[2024-07-18T11:24:28] 'lekrsu': Spintend has measurments on the listings on their website
[2024-07-18T11:24:39] crimeware: yes but I am creating a 3D Cad model
[2024-07-18T11:24:46] crimeware: with the caps sticking out for people to 3D Print
[2024-07-18T11:25:10] crimeware: To get aprox fittings right before purchase.
[2024-07-18T11:25:33] 'lekrsu': They stick up 2mm
[2024-07-18T11:25:46] crimeware: üö¨ you don't seem to understand
[2024-07-18T11:26:01] 'lekrsu': hehe
[2024-07-18T11:26:11] crimeware: I re-create a 3D Model of the ubox
[2024-07-18T11:26:31] 'lekrsu': Yes, do you want the measurment from the caps on the sides, and the diameter of them?
[2024-07-18T11:28:35] crimeware: <photos/photo_16172@18-07-2024_11-28-35.jpg>
[2024-07-18T11:28:42] crimeware: that's all I need
[2024-07-18T11:29:01] 'lekrsu': That's the image I already sent, what
[2024-07-18T11:29:15] crimeware: there are green arrows
[2024-07-18T11:29:23] crimeware: maybe I will draw them purple for better sight
[2024-07-18T11:29:27] 'lekrsu': xD, yes I'll measure
[2024-07-18T11:30:26] crimeware: <photos/photo_16173@18-07-2024_11-30-26.jpg>

[2024-07-18T11:41:27] Yamal: 6 fet?
[2024-07-18T11:41:45] crimeware: I will release the model on Thingiverse, Makerworld and Printables
[2024-07-18T11:41:51] crimeware: do you want credits lerksu for the help?
[2024-07-18T11:42:07] 'lekrsu': If you feel like I deserve it, :3
[2024-07-18T11:42:12] crimeware: ofc you deserve it
[2024-07-18T11:42:27] crimeware: highres images, with good mesurments ofc they deserve credits
[2024-07-18T11:42:52] crimeware: is that a pine64 book?
[2024-07-18T11:43:21] 'lekrsu': I've been told that, haven't flipped the pcb to check.
[2024-07-18T11:43:47] 'lekrsu': No, it's the soldering tips shipping box, :c
[2024-07-18T11:43:52] crimeware: Ah
[2024-07-18T11:43:58] Yamal: Do you know how to put the (km/range) values correctly in the App? I definitely set the values wrong, at least the ones km..
[2024-07-18T11:44:02] crimeware: Friend of mine bought a Framework
[2024-07-18T11:45:09] 'lekrsu': It fluctuates so much during runtime from v-drop anyway. Haven't looked at it.
[2024-07-18T11:45:43] Yamal: I remember a long time ago I set it to full battery, values such as 150km/130/ I don't remember well... but now it is always 1.5 or 4,... I don't know...
[2024-07-18T11:46:49] 'lekrsu': Did you set the capacity?
[2024-07-18T11:47:53] Yamal: Later I check, but I think yes is 40ah
[2024-07-18T11:49:03] Yamal: ‚Ä¶
[2024-07-18T11:49:19] 'lekrsu': I guess the % left could be improved with BMS comms via whatever, haven't checked if that's possible with ANT. I've seen the tab for BMS in VescTool.
[2024-07-18T11:50:38] 'lekrsu': I guess this is where it gets the total wh to use division against the calculated wh/km
[2024-07-18T11:51:42] Yamal: I check
[2024-07-18T11:55:12] crimeware: <photos/photo_16177@18-07-2024_11-55-12.jpg>
[2024-07-18T11:56:30] crimeware: I swear, if they are brand new they feel different
[2024-07-18T12:00:01] Yamal: This is the problem 6ah‚Ä¶

[2024-07-18T12:47:45] crimeware: it's about fucking time, holy shit does that software suck ass sometimes and its also a bitch to work with...

[2024-07-18T13:42:52] Alex: Do anyone know on the spiny power button where does goes the original cables?
[2024-07-18T13:43:41] Alex: Cause on the regular ubox power button there is 6 pin and 5 had been attached
[2024-07-18T13:43:56] Alex: And on the spiny power button there is only 4 pins
[2024-07-18T13:46:30] francois schempers: spintend button as Vbat (batterie voltage) Vin, Gnd and 5v for the leds, if there's no led then it's just Vin, gnd and Vbat can someone correct me if I'm wrong

[2024-07-18T14:01:31] crimeware: for anyone have fun printing it
[2024-07-18T14:01:56] crimeware: Will import more once I get a ubox lite on my hands
[2024-07-18T14:03:05] Alex: And can you help me which leg is which? Can i weld with the original cable? I have 3 colors there black white green black
[2024-07-18T14:03:55] haku: is this a good throttle for small hands?
[2024-07-18T14:04:24] crimeware: How small are talking about?
[2024-07-18T14:04:29] haku: asking for my son
[2024-07-18T14:04:38] haku: 5yr old
[2024-07-18T14:04:59] crimeware: Yes, they work but I recommend those:
[2024-07-18T14:05:22] crimeware: <photos/photo_16183@18-07-2024_14-05-22.jpg>
[2024-07-18T14:05:46] haku: great. looks like a good price
[2024-07-18T15:04:50] Noname: They have a nub to fit the g30 bars though. Can't remember the clamp part? Have one at home
[2024-07-18T15:11:54] Yamal: Good for summer üëçüòÅ
[2024-07-18T15:13:43] crimeware: Ahhh my ubox lite finished printing

[2024-07-18T15:32:13] crimeware: I don't own a ubox & I need a plastic model to see fittings before I buy
[2024-07-18T15:37:10] Yamal: You want to buy ubox 100/100?
[2024-07-18T15:41:58] 'lekrsu': It'll fit almost anywhere
[2024-07-18T15:42:42] Yamal: Why not 85/150
[2024-07-18T15:48:25] Yamal: I dream of buying TRAMPA, I don't care if it is more or less powerful, but TRAMPA
[2024-07-18T15:49:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: Old models was not reliable

[2024-07-18T16:33:22] Noname: That's prob why your purchasing one
[2024-07-18T16:33:43] Noname: The spring in those is a bit much though.
[2024-07-18T16:35:20] haku: can you reccomend me another thumb throttle?

[2024-07-19T13:07:14] GABE: Can also fit some cells behind the scooter cause the original motor wont be in that place anymore, escs on bottom or whatever, still the same pack, no external bullshit. Or maybe external shizzle with a 4S, So i can change between 20 and 24s. more versatility. its my scooter and i choose to not use a 4S BMS, but an external one.

[2024-07-20T20:43:42] Rogerio Figueiredo: How you attach to frame
[2024-07-20T20:52:20] haku: only 190kg? i can lift that in a back of a truck. are you sure?
[2024-07-20T20:52:31] haku: looks heavier than that
[2024-07-20T20:54:02] haku: i DL this easy baby.
[2024-07-20T20:56:17] Rogerio Figueiredo: What is that
[2024-07-20T21:00:46] GABE: it cant be that heavy?
[2024-07-20T21:01:30] puneDir: why it isnt?
[2024-07-20T21:01:44] GABE: 190kg need like 50hp to propel that.
[2024-07-20T21:01:53] GABE: 6kw wont be enougg
[2024-07-20T21:01:55] puneDir: Bare frame + fork of the puneron is alone 50kg
[2024-07-20T21:02:12] puneDir: R6 is 125hp
[2024-07-20T21:02:17] haku: puneron frame is stainless yea?
[2024-07-20T21:02:22] GABE: i mean if changed to electric
[2024-07-20T21:02:22] puneDir: Yes
[2024-07-20T21:02:40] haku: i want stainless not alu. r6 is aluminum yea?
[2024-07-20T21:02:45] 'lekrsu': If you remove the motor & all, wonder how much weight that is
[2024-07-20T21:02:59] puneDir: The one changed to electric is r25 which is 170kg
[2024-07-20T21:03:35] puneDir: Alu

[2024-07-20T21:06:33] haku: do you know where the vin is? or every part is stamped with it?
[2024-07-20T21:06:39] puneDir: Around 110
[2024-07-20T21:06:59] puneDir: Not sure
[2024-07-20T21:09:27] puneDir: In front of the rear shock And right side of the front bar
[2024-07-20T21:10:37] haku: the engine block also has a vin yea?
[2024-07-20T21:12:48] puneDir: No
[2024-07-20T21:16:30] haku: the timing of finding this all lines up. i have the batteries and shoping for a 32s bms. all i need is a motor and a esc
[2024-07-20T21:16:55] haku: it might be a test from the universe
[2024-07-20T21:17:31] haku: and im super duper very strong to lift this thing too
[2024-07-20T21:20:38] haku: i will stay strong and not let the demons win

[2024-07-20T21:22:11] Noname: Again rolling around on a street bike with no tag is asking for trouble.
[2024-07-20T21:23:51] haku: open carry electric chopper boy says otherwise lol
[2024-07-20T21:24:19] haku: different from a street bike though

[2024-07-20T21:27:45] GABE: lol
[2024-07-20T21:27:50] 'lekrsu': LMAO
[2024-07-20T21:28:25] 'lekrsu': Oh sorry sir, the charger must be leaking 240v back somehow
[2024-07-20T21:28:43] GABE: ''yeah sherriff it seems to be above 42 alright''
[2024-07-20T21:29:14] haku: here in nevada electric pevs still not popular enough for cops to stop you
[2024-07-20T21:29:52] haku: but Noname is right though. its a street bike not a ebike
[2024-07-20T21:31:08] Noname: Just buy your little dingus emoto already
[2024-07-20T21:31:35] puneDir: Bad idea
[2024-07-20T21:31:44] GABE: why?
[2024-07-20T21:32:04] GABE: because one can be less balanced? that shouldnt happen anyway with new cells.
[2024-07-20T21:32:39] puneDir: If hes making a electric r6 he should make it properly
[2024-07-20T21:32:44] GABE: True.

[2024-07-21T00:28:48] haku: what vesc do you have?
[2024-07-21T00:29:26] haku: vesc mostly for small pevs. those escs you mentioned are big escs. double or triple the size

[2024-07-21T16:23:43] Unknown: Today i have figured that when i add motor phase its improve the speed beyond the duty cycle. My duty cycle giving only 40kmh With 120a field gives 65kh With nore field the motor doing problem after releasing the throttle so i tried to get more speed in another way. I improved motor phase from 120 to 160 and its given me more 4-6kmh :)
[2024-07-21T16:24:03] Unknown: Another ways to get better highest speed? (Using 6.02) Thanks for your time

[2024-07-21T18:21:43] NetworkDir: stock controller?
[2024-07-21T18:22:01] luffydnoob: Yes everything stock
[2024-07-21T18:22:16] NetworkDir: this battery is internal or external?
[2024-07-21T18:22:31] NetworkDir: pull 44A from external and internal connected?
[2024-07-21T18:22:40] luffydnoob: When it windy I hardly get to 70km/h
[2024-07-21T18:24:17] luffydnoob: External, batteries are not connected en parallel each is separate due to scooter feature that it has with switch key to each battery
[2024-07-21T18:25:38] NetworkDir: So everything looks fine
[2024-07-21T18:25:52] NetworkDir: victor controllers are 25-25A and on total should 45-50A
[2024-07-21T18:26:48] luffydnoob: They are 30a
[2024-07-21T18:27:27] NetworkDir: do you calibrate jkbms current?
[2024-07-21T18:28:09] NetworkDir: also maybe dualtron 30a = 25a xD bad shunts and etc
[2024-07-21T18:28:36] luffydnoob: How do I do that ?
[2024-07-21T18:28:51] luffydnoob: üòÇ
[2024-07-21T18:29:36] luffydnoob: With vesc can I get batter results, speeds??
[2024-07-21T18:29:37] NetworkDir: you need something for load and measure current with multimeter on settings you can see it
[2024-07-21T18:29:52] NetworkDir: yes of course at least it's should work less sound and heat
[2024-07-21T18:30:17] luffydnoob: Unfortunately I don't now
[2024-07-21T18:30:28] NetworkDir: but for first vesc i don't recommend purchase makerbase/flipsky especially 75100

[2024-07-22T09:15:21] haku: yes. vesc depends on how many batteries i can fit. on all compartments. seven vesc looks good
[2024-07-22T09:15:32] Yamal: Wou
[2024-07-22T09:15:38] FreehandZ: what is it?

[2024-07-22T09:16:14] Yamal: SevEn look amazing
[2024-07-22T09:16:27] haku: no idea yet. need to check fitment
[2024-07-22T09:16:36] Yamal: Cool mini bike
[2024-07-22T09:16:37] FreehandZ: is it the hardware parts e.g. frame, wheels, tires?
[2024-07-22T09:16:47] FreehandZ: or a working one
[2024-07-22T09:16:50] haku: mini bike scooter
[2024-07-22T09:17:07] Yamal: 70h motor?
[2024-07-22T09:17:14] FreehandZ: why not 80h
[2024-07-22T09:17:17] haku: just frame. i have motors
[2024-07-22T09:17:23] FreehandZ: ah cool, what motors?
[2024-07-22T09:17:59] haku: 70h. im only going to ride this at 35-45 miles per hour
[2024-07-22T09:18:35] Yamal: Why not 80mph? Yes, you can‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏è
[2024-07-22T09:18:53] haku: my shaman said thats the fastest i can go
[2024-07-22T09:19:53] Yamal: :(
[2024-07-22T09:20:01] Yamal: Ok üëå
[2024-07-22T09:42:34] FrizerSeb: hello currently designing a new battery I am looking for a spot welder for 0.3mm copper that is not too expensive, do you have any ideas to recommend to me?
[2024-07-22T09:43:18] Martin Kaktits: What about hall sensor extra samples? I cant find any info about this at all, only whats in the "help" button. How noisy is noisy? How do i know if too noisy? How high or low can i go and how much it impacts frequency and what
[2024-07-22T10:12:27] FreehandZ: Dang 0.3mm copper? What kind of pack you building?
[2024-07-22T10:17:32] FrizerSeb: I'm going to build a 20s5p molicel or 40t with this kind of copper strip
[2024-07-22T10:17:39] FrizerSeb: <photos/photo_16268@22-07-2024_10-17-39.jpg>
[2024-07-22T10:18:11] FreehandZ: 0.3mm isn't needed then?
[2024-07-22T10:18:26] FreehandZ: Looks interesting
[2024-07-22T10:18:50] FrizerSeb: I keep most of the budget for the cells I hope to find happiness for cheap
[2024-07-22T10:20:34] FreehandZ: Have you looked at the eve 40pl
[2024-07-22T10:23:08] FrizerSeb: not at all, after consultation they look incredible üòØ
[2024-07-22T10:33:17] FrizerSeb: the area to be soldered is not copper we agree ?
[2024-07-22T10:33:29] FrizerSeb: <photos/photo_16269@22-07-2024_10-33-29.jpg>
[2024-07-22T10:33:54] FreehandZ: That's very interesting
[2024-07-22T10:34:06] FrizerSeb: Yeah
[2024-07-22T10:34:10] FreehandZ: Is it just nickel?
[2024-07-22T10:34:18] FrizerSeb: I suppose
[2024-07-22T10:34:51] FreehandZ: If it's not very thick nickel, then most spotwelders will do
[2024-07-22T10:35:03] FreehandZ: Lipos should do
[2024-07-22T10:35:35] FrizerSeb: if the area to be welded is nickel that would be perfect

[2024-07-22T11:48:49] FreehandZ: Looks really thin to me, it's nice being so small but how well will it do in a ride?
[2024-07-22T12:45:16] Yamal: Yehaaa
[2024-07-22T13:13:19] GABE: Take a guess.
[2024-07-22T13:57:43] Yamal: Cute minibike

[2024-07-22T14:43:38] Noname: Guy has one in our group. No rear suspension is a killer.
[2024-07-22T14:44:27] Noname: Congratulations üéä üëè üíê ü•≥ üíñ
[2024-07-22T14:48:45] Yamal: ?who, Why?
[2024-07-22T15:01:58] Noname: Hard tail literally kicks your ass
[2024-07-22T15:02:17] Noname: Idk met him once. He said it hurt to ride
[2024-07-22T15:04:12] Noname: @Bradhaku is that Alibaba? I tried getting just a vsett 11 frame from aliexpress, convo just died üòÜ
[2024-07-22T15:07:40] GABE: i was speeding once going downhill, and i didnt realize the 2.5 meter cliff infront of me, the hardtail killed me.
[2024-07-22T15:07:57] GABE: I was surprised i actually balanced the landing, tho. i suppose my ass took the hit
[2024-07-22T15:08:40] GABE: Going on a trail that has an international race going on, me with no helmet, good times.
[2024-07-22T15:08:53] Noname: My scooter is a spine jarring p.o.s. üòÜ
[2024-07-22T15:09:29] GABE: just do a triple sandwich?
[2024-07-22T15:09:47] GABE: you only need like 0.8mm for that lol
[2024-07-22T15:09:48] Noname: I almost wiped out yesterday. Came around a corner hot and there was dirt and rocks from flash flood. Puckered sphincter on that one
[2024-07-22T15:10:07] GABE: that strip is a scam.
[2024-07-22T15:10:30] GABE: youre balling.
[2024-07-22T15:23:46] Noname: Why? Nickle resistance ruins effect of copper?
[2024-07-22T15:24:23] GABE: Hmm? the copper must have direct contact with the cell. Also i mean that premade copper mesh is super expensive.
[2024-07-22T15:24:46] GABE: sure, the triple copper sandwich would worsen resistance but its better than nothing
[2024-07-22T15:24:55] Noname: Well the cell is nickle plated also?
[2024-07-22T15:25:15] GABE: Nickel plated means nothing, even copper sheets are mostly nickel plated.
[2024-07-22T15:25:34] GABE: Yes but its where the power is generated so theres fuck all resistance
[2024-07-22T15:25:55] Noname: True
[2024-07-22T15:27:05] GABE: I assume, double copper sandwich would lessen resistance by like 25-35%, but not 50%, as the electrons have to travel further, (even thru the nickel layers, therefore the height of the sheets is acting like a wire, which inherintly is a resistor. So it does not compound linearly
[2024-07-22T15:27:28] GABE: So thicker copper is better, but for his setup he barely needs like 0.05-0.08, its only 5P
[2024-07-22T15:29:54] FrizerSeb: I forget and opt for sandwich welding, thank you for your explanations
[2024-07-22T15:32:00] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: I'll add to the question: and how necessary is it ?
[2024-07-22T15:34:03] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: So not god speed
[2024-07-22T16:02:37] GABE: Im on adderall rn and im back on track lmao. Its all came back to me. Good god i hate adhd. Im not wasting these ever again.
[2024-07-22T16:02:47] GABE: Ive been glued to the desk all day and yesterday
[2024-07-22T16:03:07] GABE: Back on it. it did, since when was AC theory so fun?
[2024-07-22T16:05:01] GABE: Only learned a few hours ago that S^2 = P^2 + Q^2, and that the phase angle can be calculated for voltage and current with Arctan..... üôä I was so far behind.
[2024-07-22T16:12:52] üé∏ POSS üèÅ (Crimekillz): nice... vibing on some mcat rn

[2024-07-22T16:22:19] NetworkDir: i hear about heat problems on purple 75/100 so 100V100A better
[2024-07-22T16:28:14] haku: english buddy. this aint the french congo
[2024-07-22T16:28:16] Noname: I'm not buying any more ev's
[2024-07-22T16:28:47] purp: dope! thanks!
[2024-07-22T16:29:07] haku: why?
[2024-07-22T16:29:15] purp: so although the 100v100a is physically smaller. it handles heat better than the purple?
[2024-07-22T16:30:19] NetworkDir: yes better ask @jamessoderstrom
[2024-07-22T16:30:57] haku: this and a electric motorcycle and a g30 is all want. ill sell everything else

[2024-07-22T17:10:59] 'lekrsu': Yes, read on the site that it's even swappable if one breaks

[2024-07-22T17:13:55] Noname: I missed a craft Faire thing had 5 min to look at a castle and had to walk to BK for lunch, my time wasted in a hot ass sketch parking lot charging.
[2024-07-22T17:17:18] Noname: I saw the street version of the scoot I want pass me at the charger. Honda pcx, almost went running after them to take a look. My Shaman said fossil fuel is the way
[2024-07-22T18:47:32] haku: use gas for long ass trips. and electric for short ones like running to the store and stuff. just sell me your niu already ffs
[2024-07-22T18:48:04] haku: before my alibaba ships

[2024-07-23T00:52:01] NetworkDir: Connected to 5V with pull down resistor
[2024-07-23T00:52:50] NetworkDir: I try with another throttle but still same
[2024-07-23T00:53:20] Noname: Decent but should see the shit I miss. Lot more area connected here people move around etc. It's got a title wich is rare usually lost
[2024-07-23T00:53:47] Noname: @Bradhaku don't steal shit. That bike was nothing but trouble
[2024-07-23T00:54:22] haku: i did not steal it. i just found it hehe
[2024-07-23T00:54:34] haku: anyways i did not take it anyway
[2024-07-23T00:54:45] Noname: Shoving a stolen bike in an escalade is also stealing
[2024-07-23T00:55:10] haku: i agree. im not about that life
[2024-07-23T00:55:24] haku: dude good find on this though
[2024-07-23T00:56:37] haku: made in japan too
[2024-07-23T00:56:55] purp: awesome! thanks!
[2024-07-23T00:56:59] NetworkDir: Anyway i think you can find engine fucked up big motors
[2024-07-23T00:57:26] purp: what‚Äôs the max phase amps for the 100v100A?
[2024-07-23T00:58:41] NetworkDir: I think 100-120A
[2024-07-23T00:58:54] NetworkDir: Max ~5kW
[2024-07-23T01:01:04] Noname: We will see if I have enough cash for it. Have a 200cc motor at home. 0$ to get running but some fab work. Be funny with reverse gear üòÜ
[2024-07-23T01:01:41] haku: you can prolly rebuilt that siezed motor. you have the tools for it
[2024-07-23T01:02:50] purp: sick! thanks!
[2024-07-23T01:03:07] Noname: Na weird engine swaps are fun
[2024-07-23T01:03:30] purp: do you know if you can run a adc adapter for lights only? could i use a external 12v directly to the adc adapter to distribute power to the lights?
[2024-07-23T01:03:32] Noname: Plus semi auto shift
[2024-07-23T01:03:43] purp: from what i see. the 100v doesn‚Äôt have a 12v output
[2024-07-23T01:04:17] NetworkDir: I think ubox lite haven't 12V output for externals
[2024-07-23T01:04:31] NetworkDir: So you should buy dc dc step up regulators
[2024-07-23T01:06:25] purp: can i power the adc adapter from a dcdc adapter?
[2024-07-23T01:06:34] NetworkDir: Yes
[2024-07-23T01:07:58] purp: <photos/photo_16278@23-07-2024_01-07-58.jpg>
[2024-07-23T01:08:29] NetworkDir: You can supply with external 12V without any issues
[2024-07-23T01:08:34] purp: i guess my question is could i use an external dcdc 12v source to power this for lighting? s
[2024-07-23T01:08:41] purp: oh awesome thanks!
[2024-07-23T01:09:47] NetworkDir: If you want use ubox lite you need external dcsc If 80150 ubox 12V 3A available should fine for some horn and lights but anyway better use external :D
[2024-07-23T01:11:17] NetworkDir: No i just connected to 5V and add 10k pot on throttle
[2024-07-23T01:11:57] NetworkDir: Yeah i see esp32-throttle adc and some vesc projects use capasitor
[2024-07-23T01:12:22] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_16279@23-07-2024_01-12-22.jpg>
[2024-07-23T01:12:37] NetworkDir: 100nF capacitor
[2024-07-23T01:12:37] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. NetworkDir has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-07-23T01:22:21] purp: i‚Äôm trying to see if i can fit a 85150. if not i‚Äôll have to go 100v. if i use the adc adapter with the controllers can i still use an external 12v output?
[2024-07-23T01:55:41] Matthew: No, I actually mean voltage unless that fault is wrong. Its near a full soc. But im running 18s so i have some headroom with the capability of the ubox 85150. Or am i way wrong with that thought?
[2024-07-23T01:56:37] Matthew: It's a fault being thrown on the vesc tool.
[2024-07-23T02:42:15] Rose: Hey there basuky, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2024-07-23T04:46:53] haku: thats actually pretty cool. wish it was smaller

[2024-07-23T19:34:50] haku: i like scooters but as an elderly person. standing in high speeds is difficult. my body feels like a parachute. specially after working legs
[2024-07-23T19:35:19] haku: gimme.

[2024-07-23T22:15:47] haku: Noname rumor is NYC is cracking up on scooters and ebikes hard now
[2024-07-23T22:16:06] Noname: Gas scooters
[2024-07-23T22:16:41] Noname: And prob surrons
[2024-07-23T22:16:42] haku: its the migrant robberies according to folks
[2024-07-23T22:17:06] Noname: Ah ye old quiet purse snatchers
[2024-07-23T22:17:45] Noname: Euc's are illegal but they don't do shit. It's wild out there.
[2024-07-23T22:17:58] 'lekrsu': Why's EUC's illegal
[2024-07-23T22:18:07] 'lekrsu': Cars should be illegal
[2024-07-23T22:18:22] Noname: Idk think they're banned. They're psycho out there.
[2024-07-23T22:18:23] 'lekrsu': Imagine how quiet NYC would be
[2024-07-23T22:18:50] haku: going on freeways and highways shouldnt be a thing for eucs and scooters
[2024-07-23T22:18:53] Noname: Yeah but they race around full send and blow through intersections. Ride on highways etc
[2024-07-23T22:19:27] 'lekrsu': Understandable, considering how ill suited the roads are
[2024-07-23T22:20:24] Noname: To congested for speed and nobody waiting for red light with no license plate attached
[2024-07-23T22:20:33] haku: laws are comming im telling ya. it will come to a point that we have to modify g30s
[2024-07-23T22:21:39] Noname: That's why I want a plated scoot. Nobody can do shit. Keep a g30 for bike paths and your just a average joe
[2024-07-23T22:23:37] Alex: Hi guys! Im nearly done with my first build what i do alone. Im nearly in finish. Can anyone help to write down step by step how can i program my beast as best as it could?
[2024-07-23T22:23:37] Alex: <photos/photo_16292@23-07-2024_22-23-37.jpg>
[2024-07-23T22:23:37] Alex: <photos/photo_16293@23-07-2024_22-23-37.jpg>
[2024-07-23T22:23:56] Alex: Im using spintend single 200A controllers
[2024-07-23T22:24:23] Noname: It's the large scary looking things whipping by that grandma is scared over. The group "gang" rides on the road blocking traffic. The full face helmets and pads make you look like a storm trooper Just out enjoying the sunshine on a lil scoot and nobody cares. Or stay with traffic on a registered vehicle. Days are numbered I've seen it first hand
[2024-07-23T22:24:27] Alex: With a 72v 20s9p samsung 40t cells peak 405amper
[2024-07-23T22:25:18] Alex: The motors have been modified it can handle around 180-200amper maximum
[2024-07-23T22:25:38] Alex: But i can modify the amper after i see how it gets warmer
[2024-07-23T22:26:13] haku: i called it first buddy
[2024-07-23T22:27:35] haku: i just hope peaceful nevada doesnt follow. we dont have gang rides here
[2024-07-23T22:27:41] Noname: Obv can't have fun anymore, to many people. Even the drones got hammered. There's just to many irresponsible folk running wild. No taxes being paid and cops don't know what to do.
[2024-07-23T22:27:47] Alex: And i want to use it with the spiny y2 throttle
[2024-07-23T22:28:00] Alex: I dont know how to program it
[2024-07-23T22:28:09] Alex: Or do i have to program it
[2024-07-23T22:28:18] haku: gang rides here are on harleys lol
[2024-07-23T22:29:01] haku: yea i remember when drones got the hammer.
[2024-07-23T22:29:09] Noname: I'll keep a few elec things around but going back to gas.
[2024-07-23T22:29:48] haku: my guess is there will be a new class of pev registration
[2024-07-23T22:32:32] Noname: Unfortunately looks good on paper. Scoot instead of driving an suv to work. It's a weird transition. No regulations and run a muck. But where does it go? I don't have to inspect my moped just 40$ 2yr for a plate but it goes "27mph". Euc/scoot are hitting 50+mph. How do you deal.with that?
[2024-07-23T22:33:30] haku: true.
[2024-07-23T22:34:38] haku: ofcourse there will be safety standards. brake lights, signals and stuff
[2024-07-23T22:37:20] haku: this is the only thing i disagree with 47. electric has its uses.
[2024-07-23T22:56:26] üá™üá∏AYO#74üèÅ: I'm going to put it only for charging since the battery will never reach the discharge level requested by the controller, which I don't need, I'm sorry.
[2024-07-23T23:08:48] Noname: There are laws for scoots. Not past dark blinkers brake lights
[2024-07-23T23:09:24] Noname: The new segway max has blinkers they're evolving already
[2024-07-23T23:09:59] haku: segway knows
[2024-07-23T23:10:50] haku: too bad its thier product the surron thats making it look bad haha
[2024-07-23T23:12:06] Noname: Well shops put up signs off road use or private property. But they don't enforce it so it's just unknowing or fucktards playing but it's electric game I didn't know.
[2024-07-23T23:13:14] Noname: One of my friends even tries to convince himself of it. Clearly a k6 is to fast and to much power to be an ebike
[2024-07-23T23:13:30] haku: i hope my china mini bike china scoot wont attract attention. im a law abiding citizen
[2024-07-23T23:14:08] haku: i just ride in the hood anyway
[2024-07-23T23:14:11] Noname: Remember 2stroke pocket bikes? Lil crotch rockets it's that all over again.
[2024-07-23T23:14:32] haku: honda ruckus lol
[2024-07-23T23:14:46] Noname: Yup
[2024-07-23T23:16:02] haku: maybe if i put a back the blue sticker they wouldnt pull me over
[2024-07-23T23:16:56] Noname: And a class 1 ebike stick for good measure.
[2024-07-23T23:17:33] haku: i am selling mine just waiting for the tarrifs to hit so price will go up
[2024-07-23T23:18:02] haku: my vsett too
[2024-07-23T23:18:15] Noname: Be a long time till they kill off wimpy pedal bikes. Surrons and euc first.
[2024-07-23T23:18:51] Noname: Considering they rent ebikes in citys
[2024-07-23T23:30:31] Yamal: Nop üòÅ
[2024-07-23T23:35:12] Jan: Be careful to follow thr calibration steps closely
[2024-07-23T23:35:41] Jan: If you dont, you could experience the same not stoppable 100% throttle runoff
[2024-07-23T23:36:02] Alex: Can you send them?
[2024-07-23T23:36:05] 'lekrsu': What would cause that?
[2024-07-23T23:36:29] Jan: Its on their website how to do it
[2024-07-23T23:36:34] Alex: Or there is not any video about it?
[2024-07-23T23:36:55] Jan: I dont know
[2024-07-23T23:47:24] Alex: And what about the software installing? Is there any extra setup what i have to improve for the better performance
[2024-07-23T23:47:44] Alex: I know the regular installing process
[2024-07-23T23:49:31] purp: <photos/photo_16294@23-07-2024_23-49-31.jpg>
[2024-07-23T23:49:55] purp: anyone have any pics or ideas for inspiration? trying to see if i can mount bigger controllers on the stem while still making it look sleek and clean
[2024-07-24T00:35:00] haku: is this the student version of fusion? why only free for a year?
[2024-07-24T00:44:08] Finn: You need a student license or smth to use it
[2024-07-24T00:46:15] haku: dam
[2024-07-24T00:48:35] haku: i just have a .edu email
[2024-07-24T00:50:27] haku: i just got the 30day free trial
[2024-07-24T00:51:38] haku: can anyone please help me make an open box. i dont know how to cad
[2024-07-24T00:55:51] Yamal: Nami, I consider it finished James, it is just as it is... I am happy with its performance, new controllers would be for future projects if they ever arrive! and little more than enjoying what people are putting out, learning and nourishing from it. In my dreams remains that circuit scooter capable of anything, that achieves dizzying top speeds with monstrous accelerations and heart-stopping temperatures.....‚Ä¶.
[2024-07-24T00:56:15] Noname: Take actual batterys the 498 you have on a shelf and line then up
[2024-07-24T00:56:43] haku: i have to stack em
[2024-07-24T00:57:53] Yamal: to a friend
[2024-07-24T00:59:13] haku: i have to figure out cad real quick and just make a box with those dimensions
[2024-07-24T00:59:47] haku: then ill print it
[2024-07-24T01:01:57] haku: its about time i learn fusion. ive been wanting to for a while.
[2024-07-24T01:03:56] crimeware: What you wanna print?
[2024-07-24T01:04:15] crimeware: Fusion 360 is free
[2024-07-24T01:04:21] crimeware: You don't need to pay
[2024-07-24T01:04:48] crimeware: They just want to lure you in a trap like humans do with rats & cheese
[2024-07-24T01:04:49] haku: sorry auto reply. i need a box
[2024-07-24T01:04:58] crimeware: What kind of box?
[2024-07-24T01:05:30] haku: hold on let me draw it
[2024-07-24T01:05:33] crimeware: Big box, small box, wide box, box with arm
[2024-07-24T01:05:45] crimeware: A box within a box?
[2024-07-24T01:06:31] haku: its meduim size
[2024-07-24T01:06:43] crimeware: Sounds like my girlfriend
[2024-07-24T01:06:58] haku: Length 17.5cm, height 35.5cm, width 16.2cm
[2024-07-24T01:06:58] crimeware: Just that she had a bigger pp üò≠
[2024-07-24T01:07:17] crimeware: Anything special about that box?
[2024-07-24T01:07:20] haku: is this hard to do in fusion?
[2024-07-24T01:07:24] crimeware: Hell no
[2024-07-24T01:07:31] haku: nothing just an open box
[2024-07-24T01:07:43] crimeware: Hollow box?
[2024-07-24T01:07:47] haku: yea
[2024-07-24T01:07:56] crimeware: Thickness?
[2024-07-24T01:08:26] haku: doesnt matter. something easy to print.
[2024-07-24T01:08:44] haku: i just have to figure out how many 21700 fits there
[2024-07-24T01:08:46] crimeware: What printer & what slicer are you using?
[2024-07-24T01:09:18] crimeware: There is a calculator lol
[2024-07-24T01:09:23] haku: bambu slicer and printer
[2024-07-24T01:09:40] haku: do you know the site to the calculator?
[2024-07-24T01:09:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: I have a question, why it has double USB c on the board?
[2024-07-24T01:10:05] crimeware: Yes
[2024-07-24T01:10:39] crimeware: https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/circles-within-rectangle-d_1905.html
[2024-07-24T01:10:56] haku: thank you bud. appretiate it
[2024-07-24T01:11:08] crimeware: No bullshit, simple calculator with image output

[2024-07-24T01:15:15] crimeware: Switch bambuslicer to orca slicer & never look back
[2024-07-24T01:16:21] haku: i can make these rectangles in bambu but its not hollow
[2024-07-24T01:18:06] crimeware: I will teach you
[2024-07-24T01:18:25] Noname: Your printing a box for a battery size model?
[2024-07-24T01:19:03] crimeware: Vasemode printing.
[2024-07-24T01:19:32] haku: gotcha.
[2024-07-24T01:19:56] crimeware: <photos/photo_16298@24-07-2024_01-19-56.jpg>
[2024-07-24T01:20:44] crimeware: Remember, to make a cubr with 1milimeter difference since you work with exact values inner
[2024-07-24T01:21:02] crimeware: Otherwise you have wrong porpotions
[2024-07-24T01:21:40] crimeware: If you have to make a 15x15 hollow cube, the 15x15 are 14x14
[2024-07-24T01:22:30] crimeware: üá©üá™üõ† engineering mindest
[2024-07-24T01:22:30] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. crimeware has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-07-24T01:22:38] Rose: Hey there Jose, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-07-24T01:24:06] haku: im watching this youtube on learning fusion in 30 days
[2024-07-24T01:24:59] crimeware: Just send a screenshot of the interface, I will walk you through
[2024-07-24T01:32:52] haku: thanks bro but all good. ill ask you questions in a bit. im focusing hard watching this lol
[2024-07-24T01:33:21] crimeware: Alright, booting my pc up
[2024-07-24T02:03:20] haku: i think i got it yay.
[2024-07-24T02:03:23] haku: opening it at bambu
[2024-07-24T02:08:30] haku: need a bigger printer
[2024-07-24T02:08:36] haku: <photos/photo_16300@24-07-2024_02-08-36.jpg>
[2024-07-24T02:17:40] Matthew: Yes. The battery is charged fine and discharges fine. When I use regen braking at a full soc the vesc cuts out and fault code says over voltage. I don't know where else to check. That's why I am asking is there a way to change absolute maximum voltage to say 83v??
[2024-07-24T02:20:18] crimeware: There is a solution
[2024-07-24T02:22:58] crimeware: Do you want me to fix this for you?
[2024-07-24T02:24:01] haku: all good bro. ill glue it together. i dont think i can print it in 1 piece. thanks though
[2024-07-24T02:24:08] crimeware: <photos/photo_16301@24-07-2024_02-24-08.jpg>
[2024-07-24T02:24:59] haku: yes i did cut the stl to 2 pieces. too big to fit.
[2024-07-24T02:25:25] crimeware: Before you print it, can i check the stl?
[2024-07-24T02:25:40] haku: sure 1 sec
[2024-07-24T02:26:36] haku: <files/practice rectangle.stl>
[2024-07-24T02:26:57] haku: first time making something
[2024-07-24T02:57:05] crimeware: freecad is making me fucking mad
[2024-07-24T03:03:05] haku: is freecad easier?
[2024-07-24T03:05:24] crimeware: Worse
[2024-07-24T03:06:39] haku: whats a good free cad software?
[2024-07-24T03:09:17] El: Cutoff Start and a Cuttoff End parameters for the max voltage Vesc bms settings Set max voltage - 76.6v
[2024-07-24T03:12:37] crimeware: Anything you can pirate üòÇ
[2024-07-24T03:14:17] crimeware: there is a little mistake in ur stl
[2024-07-24T03:14:53] crimeware: isn't this supposed to be 175mm?
[2024-07-24T03:37:48] crimeware: <files/VESC FIX.stl>
[2024-07-24T03:46:14] crimeware: @Bradhaku print this one, this one is fixed and and has a bottom calculated within the height :)
[2024-07-24T03:46:14] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. crimeware has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-07-24T04:02:06] haku: thanks bud
[2024-07-24T04:03:15] crimeware: Literally went over to use onshape for this üòÇüò≠
[2024-07-24T04:11:25] Noname: Is there measurement accurate? I'd wait to build untill I had scooter at home. Couple mm off and your fucked
[2024-07-24T04:11:31] Matthew: I set it to 76.6v and then after write complete. Exit tool. Link back onto vesc and go to the settings and it goes back to 76v.
[2024-07-24T04:11:54] Matthew: <photos/photo_16303@24-07-2024_04-11-54.jpg>
[2024-07-24T04:17:58] haku: true. i just want a rough estimate atleast
[2024-07-24T04:34:20] El: bms settings, not controller
[2024-07-24T04:52:41] haku: what is the proper standing scooter stance. im right handed and i lead with my right foot. is it suppose to be the other way left foot forward like a boxer?
[2024-07-24T05:05:26] Noname: Of course your freaking backwards
[2024-07-24T05:05:52] haku: what is it suppose to be?
[2024-07-24T05:06:08] haku: im right handed and my left foot front?
[2024-07-24T05:11:50] haku: when i use to wrestle i shoot with my right.
[2024-07-24T05:58:25] Noname: Yeah but it depends on person. In snowboarding that's called goofy ü§™
[2024-07-24T05:59:38] haku: i dont know if i can practice leading with my left. im getting a seat anyway
[2024-07-24T06:00:49] Noname: Whatever way is comfortable. You Wana jerk off with R or L my life don't change
[2024-07-24T06:01:13] Noname: I can't corner as well backwards
[2024-07-24T06:48:12] haku: cant believe my city is turning alot of folks into the dark arts. this lady needs to meet my shaman. https://youtube.com/shorts/7roERHytUH0?si=7VZ88jUoAjba_N8w
[2024-07-24T06:56:06] Yamal: Hey there are 7/11 in America?
[2024-07-24T06:57:06] haku: yes alot. mostly with gas stations
[2024-07-24T06:58:12] Yamal: I discovered this chain of stores in Asia, I didn't know that America had
[2024-07-24T06:59:34] haku: i think its big in asia too. no 711 in eu?
[2024-07-24T06:59:49] Yamal: No..
[2024-07-24T06:59:54] haku: our 711s have slot machines lol
[2024-07-24T07:01:02] Yamal: This is my favourite in 7/11, Pau
[2024-07-24T07:01:28] Yamal: Chiken curry nice
[2024-07-24T07:01:54] Yamal: The soft bread out side is ‚Äúrice‚Äù üëç
[2024-07-24T07:02:36] haku: ive never seen bao in the US 711. here mostly hotdogs, pizza and rolls
[2024-07-24T07:04:32] Yamal: :(
[2024-07-24T07:06:03] haku: i use to go there just for the slurpees. its the best when hot summer days
[2024-07-24T07:26:49] Yamal: Just reading about little‚Äù‚Äù I have shaman to Haku! ^^
[2024-07-24T07:27:51] haku: i honestly know nothing about these boards. what is it
[2024-07-24T07:40:10] Yamal: Well, this man is the creator of this board, in fact, the Tronic 250, apparently the same as the little FOCer, is a joint creation between him and the tronic system, he explains it in one of the comments on the forum, in 150A they work perfectly my experience with them but at 200A they are killer, I don't know to what extent they will be safe with this configuration,,, I would like to contact him... what is clear that those extra 50A per motor are very noticeable
[2024-07-24T08:05:08] Yamal: <photos/photo_16306@24-07-2024_08-05-08.jpg>
[2024-07-24T08:05:39] Yamal: I have also verified that to achieve that 19kw or so, I have to take the scooter to its maximum speed, if not, it does not reach them.
[2024-07-24T08:44:49] Yamal: This summer's movie is called "the Rodrigez"
[2024-07-24T09:35:30] puneDir: Fuck makerbase
[2024-07-24T09:35:31] puneDir: Fuck
[2024-07-24T09:35:34] puneDir: Kill makerbase
[2024-07-24T09:35:37] puneDir: Delete makerbase
[2024-07-24T09:38:10] Yamal: Why?
[2024-07-24T09:38:21] Yamal: Zero 10 x problem?
[2024-07-24T09:43:44] puneDir: Makerbase decided to burn while standing still
[2024-07-24T09:44:00] puneDir: 4.5 km no problem but its fucked now
[2024-07-24T09:44:03] puneDir: For no reason
[2024-07-24T09:44:09] puneDir: Fuck makerbase
[2024-07-24T09:44:10] puneDir: Fuck
[2024-07-24T09:44:10] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. puneDir has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-07-24T09:47:51] Yamal: But. In zero or emoto
[2024-07-24T09:48:27] puneDir: <photos/photo_16307@24-07-2024_09-48-27.jpg>
[2024-07-24T09:48:38] Yamal: Sorry
[2024-07-24T09:49:02] Yamal: Now I remember yes emoto, with de savoton
[2024-07-24T09:49:54] puneDir: Never gonna buy makerbase again
[2024-07-24T09:50:29] Yamal: Time for buy seven
[2024-07-24T09:51:04] puneDir: @jamessoderstrom
[2024-07-24T09:51:54] Yamal: Or spintend 85250
[2024-07-24T09:54:24] Yamal: And more so, people who have experience with vesc, you can't go for the cheap, you should go for the top.
[2024-07-24T10:07:24] Yamal: Emoto still working?
[2024-07-24T10:18:19] puneDir: It doesnt have makerbase
[2024-07-24T10:20:32] Yamal: Yeah ,! I know, but I mean it's already finished and are you using it?
[2024-07-24T10:44:25] puneDir: I putted the zeros batt to it
[2024-07-24T10:44:31] puneDir: So i can get to school etc
[2024-07-24T10:44:50] puneDir: Its battery hasnt finished yet (waiting for bms

[2024-07-24T12:21:39] Yamal: I can't make a statistic to throw away,,,, :(
[2024-07-24T12:21:39] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-07-24T12:51:13] NetworkDir: Depends what you want
[2024-07-24T12:55:53] GABE: @Mltra
[2024-07-24T12:56:41] GABE: If i give my dyson 6x P42A, then will it still shut off at 70% charge like before? is Uploading new firmware onto the board actually necessary? Because i dont have the hardware for it.
[2024-07-24T12:57:15] GABE: Perhaps if i give it 2P of P42A, then it will be 3x more capacity than stock, which would mean it would not shut off anyway, and the voltage sag would be virtually zero, so it would not trigger shutdowns whatsoever?
[2024-07-24T12:58:15] GABE: Perhaps even 1P of P42A would prevent shutdowns entirely? as the P30's are only rated for 30a and are 3000mah.
[2024-07-24T13:09:58] Yamal: Depends Wich is better ,,?
[2024-07-24T13:14:04] Konstantin: Big chance to block bms, and write error code to eep
[2024-07-24T13:14:19] GABE: i dont understand.
[2024-07-24T13:14:26] GABE: what do you mean; big chance to block the bms
[2024-07-24T13:14:47] GABE: i know nothing about these vaccums at all bro
[2024-07-24T13:17:28] Yamal: It is clear that everyone has their own tastes and preferences, and that is what is interesting to me, see each person's preference and a little why....
[2024-07-24T13:17:38] Konstantin: If you don't own pickkit , it's treacky to change cells. Bms if saw any cell voltage drop, has chance to block ...
[2024-07-24T13:18:36] GABE: I can just charge the cells to the same voltage as what they were before they got taken out.
[2024-07-24T13:18:46] GABE: Ill measure them now. i have 5 left, so itll be a good sample
[2024-07-24T13:20:18] GABE: all at 3.99-4.00v with one being 3.97v. i dont think thats enough to trigger a bms error in any way.
[2024-07-24T13:20:54] GABE: Ill be changing the cells in an hour or so. Your opinion; should i go with 1s, 2s or even 3s? 1s would be 140% stock capacity. but to be honest, even the stock 100% felt a bit trash when new. perhaps going 280% (2s) would be triple capacity, better?
[2024-07-24T13:22:49] Konstantin: Not like this...
[2024-07-24T13:23:15] GABE: Do you mean it takes the exact millivoltage of every series?
[2024-07-24T13:23:16] GABE: ugh
[2024-07-24T13:23:26] Konstantin: 99% to receive error
[2024-07-24T13:23:51] GABE: you mean, 99% of 4.2v? thats 42mv.
[2024-07-24T13:23:54] GABE: oh shit
[2024-07-24T13:23:57] GABE: then im fucked
[2024-07-24T13:24:30] GABE: so i need the fucking pickit v3
[2024-07-24T13:24:55] GABE: wait, this is 30mv, it goes above 99.3%
[2024-07-24T13:24:55] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-07-24T13:25:06] Konstantin: Y can try like solder tini wires on new sells, cut old and very carefully place new...
[2024-07-24T13:28:57] GABE: I took the cells out months ago. they are all mixed up now, as for the 6th cell, its gone
[2024-07-24T13:29:28] GABE: I remember vividly, the cell i threw out was 3.97v aswell.
[2024-07-24T13:30:01] GABE: which means if i technically put every cell in at 3.98v, they would all match 99%+ and not trigger a shutdown.

[2024-07-24T16:44:58] Shlomozero10üáÆüá±: Smoke is pretty bad

[2024-07-24T16:45:44] Mirono escooters: Problably passed out from the smoke
[2024-07-24T16:52:53] Yamal: It's an e-bike battery, it's an older Chinese man who dies in that video, so seen they are banning it in the elevators there,,, I My wife sent it a while ago, I suppose for the reason of "precaution", the batteries are very very safe but sometimes things happen,,
[2024-07-24T16:56:20] Mirono escooters: He died?

[2024-07-24T17:07:17] Mirono escooters: The metal will conduct heat. no stopping it
[2024-07-24T17:07:32] Mirono escooters: Hall sensors are heat tolerating. If they die from heat, something is bad
[2024-07-24T17:08:58] Medhi Cantin: So I don't use silicone in my engines
[2024-07-24T17:09:21] Medhi Cantin: There's nothing he can do to reduce the temperature

[2024-07-25T06:12:09] Noname: I'd assume if there was a charge it would since your overdoing your turn
[2024-07-25T06:20:53] haku: how many mins from empty to full on your ev charger?
[2024-07-25T06:21:09] haku: or atleast 80%

[2024-07-25T11:51:42] Rose: Hey there Rotatooor, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-07-25T12:05:10] Rotatooor: I want to use a vesc controller with my geared hub ebike motor. If I understood this correctly, the vesc will only display the speed while accelerating since it is reading it from the motor hall sensors. Is it possible to add a speed sensor to the controller so it can display the speed at all times?
[2024-07-25T13:18:49] Rose: Hey there Mike, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-07-25T14:01:01] puneDir: @jamessoderstrom
[2024-07-25T15:04:16] Noname: Displayed full time even without halls
[2024-07-25T16:23:34] Rotatooor: Uh ok, great, thanks
[2024-07-25T16:53:49] Rotatooor: But how does it figure out the speed? My bike's motor cable has a white wire which should be the internal speed sensor wire. I don't need to connect that anywhere, right?
[2024-07-25T16:55:46] Noname: I think it's back emf pulses. Idk honestly know. All I have is the 3 phase wires and it works. Now you have me questioning it haven't ridden scooter in months

[2024-07-25T19:35:25] GABE: thats a downgrade?
[2024-07-25T19:35:57] GABE: pedal assist worked just fine for me with the Fiido L3 with no hall sensors
[2024-07-25T19:36:12] GABE: Like, it accelerated just fine with my added foot torque.
[2024-07-25T19:36:21] puneDir: hell no

[2024-07-25T19:40:30] GABE: digga
[2024-07-25T19:41:20] puneDir: Zero is muuuch better in terms of comfort motors and size
[2024-07-25T19:41:20] Mirono escooters: Tbh better suspension
[2024-07-25T19:41:34] Mirono escooters: I still got a zero frame I gotta fix. Stupid useless annoying frames.

[2024-07-27T02:03:35] Jhonny Nu√±ez: <photos/photo_16346@27-07-2024_02-03-35.jpg>

[2024-07-27T02:50:38] Jhonny Nu√±ez: I don't know, I was arriving at my house, when I accelerated to enter the condominium I heard something explode, I thought it was a rock, when I hit the accelerator the controller turned off and turned back on, so I recorded a video and turned off the controller, then it did not turn on again and the can bus cable completely melted and damaged the other controller.
[2024-07-27T03:01:48] haku: vintage prolly used after ww1
[2024-07-27T03:04:47] Noname: I'm sure after using all the steel for the war this still cost 3,200$

[2024-07-27T03:10:34] Noname: Good thing it's not electric. Magnets would have rotted
[2024-07-27T03:11:10] haku: lol it says in the article it was thought that they might attract new ( female) urban customers, that would not so easily choose for a conventional motorcycle as means of transport
[2024-07-27T03:11:40] haku: gotta love the good ol days
[2024-07-27T03:19:12] NetworkDir: What voltage do you use
[2024-07-27T03:27:26] FreehandZ: Does pmt have that size?

[2024-07-27T10:50:18] Yamal: :)
[2024-07-27T10:54:30] Yamal: They are no longer made or sold, in fact the 250R were removed from the official tronic website to make way, only for the x12,, You would only have to buy them from someone, Little Forcer still lives :) X12 vs sEv¬£n üõíüöÄ
[2024-07-27T10:57:06] Yamal: They come in brief data of the x12 working with 24s17 P, I can't say moreü•∂

[2024-07-27T13:14:27] Jhonny Nu√±ez: Of course, if the can bus burned, because the controller shorted, the 3 capacitors were blown and some resistors were torn off the board by the explosion, so it was clearly shorted, the can bus of the ubox comes with voltage to turn on the other controller I think it is 12 V apart from the 5v can bus
[2024-07-27T13:31:46] NetworkDir: wtf
