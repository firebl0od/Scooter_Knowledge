[2024-07-29T14:10:25] puneDir: Ubox when i have money
[2024-07-29T14:10:27] puneDir: And molicell
[2024-07-29T14:11:46] Yamal: 85/150?
[2024-07-29T14:18:11] Smart Repair: Can I use the ADC module with just one LED for the reversing light and brake light? Can I put a resistor on the reversing light output and connect both outputs in parallel?
[2024-07-29T14:21:05] Smart Repair: <photos/photo_16411@29-07-2024_14-21-05.jpg>
[2024-07-29T14:29:08] NetworkDir: Molicell p42 useless for max 120A Lower voltage drop but $$$ so no concs
[2024-07-29T14:29:29] NetworkDir: 50H-16x4 motors on 20s and without ferrofluid max 60-60A b current
[2024-07-29T14:40:00] Yamal: NetworkDir shakes
[2024-07-29T14:53:57] GABE: you shouldnt have turned like that
[2024-07-29T14:56:45] GABE: U think better grip wouldve helped there? maybe i guess.
[2024-07-29T15:04:24] Noname: If in doubt use a diode
[2024-07-29T15:13:33] crimeware: snsc battery
[2024-07-29T15:14:12] crimeware: pmt
[2024-07-29T15:15:02] Finn: Reverse light is for driving backwards?😄
[2024-07-29T15:15:18] Finn: Or do they mean rear light
[2024-07-29T15:16:19] Finn: Diode on reverse light and maxbe a resistor for getting the light level on brake light up.
[2024-07-29T15:16:56] Smart Repair: So?
[2024-07-29T15:17:16] Давно пора: 80 laps before was going almost exactly the same trajectory but in the evening I pushed harder and motor was cooler asphalt also but tyre as a consequence hotter
[2024-07-29T15:17:28] Давно пора: I tapped throttle and lowside
[2024-07-29T15:18:07] Finn: Yeah
[2024-07-29T15:18:17] GABE: do you mean that it was a cold evening so the tyres werent as hot?
[2024-07-29T15:18:28] Finn: Not rear?
[2024-07-29T15:19:11] Давно пора: I am 1 motor and at the daytime motor was overheating and I was much slower
[2024-07-29T15:19:20] Давно пора: Anyways
[2024-07-29T15:19:39] Давно пора: I take pmts and we will see if I can catch thunder
[2024-07-29T15:20:20] Давно пора: But there are no good models for r6 rim....
[2024-07-29T15:21:02] Face de Pin Sucé: Like really soon ? 😍
[2024-07-29T15:21:07] Smart Repair: There is no rear light output
[2024-07-29T15:23:27] Finn: Would put it on head light
[2024-07-29T15:25:41] Smart Repair: you are right... parallel to the headlight 👍
[2024-07-29T15:34:07] puneDir: Maybe aspilsan
[2024-07-29T15:40:51] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If you want to connect a light to the port next to the cambus, I wouldn't do it. If you do it at your discretion, when you turn off the controller, the light will turn off.
[2024-07-29T15:46:26] Patrick: Yes the light is always on, its not possible drive and turn off. It would be very good if its go on with the light from dashboard, everything other work fine.
[2024-07-29T15:48:11] Давно пора: Ye.....
[2024-07-29T15:52:42] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Of course I can't turn it off because the light is connected to the controller. To turn off the light and drive I would have to put a switch self -locking
[2024-07-29T16:35:54] Noname: Why slicks? I'd like them because mine buzz but don't need extra grip and treaded is pointless on grass/ mud anyway
[2024-07-29T16:40:08] Давно пора: We are talking about track use
[2024-07-29T16:40:44] Давно пора: For me from usual 10" tyres is cst 10x3
[2024-07-29T16:40:53] Давно пора: It's pretty universal
[2024-07-29T16:44:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So always running,
[2024-07-29T16:44:49] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: ?

[2024-07-29T16:47:23] Yamal: 💃😂
[2024-07-29T17:06:40] Patrick: Ok, thank you. i thought the controller are so smart maybe can turn off and on if it write in the script. 😁
[2024-07-29T17:08:28] Yamal: The important question, Wich frame ?🙉
[2024-07-29T17:15:28] Face de Pin Sucé: Again 😜😏
[2024-07-29T17:15:45] Face de Pin Sucé: Why are you so amazed by Vedder ? x)
[2024-07-29T17:24:22] Yamal: because he is the one who leads the way in this orchestra
[2024-07-29T17:39:14] Smart Repair: I'm confused. According to the instructions, the positive side is switched. The circuit diagram shows that the ground is switched
[2024-07-29T17:39:33] Smart Repair: The other lights and horn are also high side switched, so connect the positive(anode) wire to the function pin, and the negative(cathode) wire to the pin to the 'G' pin.
[2024-07-29T17:40:21] Smart Repair: It contradicts itself... or am I just too stupid?
[2024-07-29T17:48:41] Smart Repair: I found the error... the brake is switched to +, and the ground is switched to the headlight

[2024-07-30T11:09:26] haku: unless its a g30. thats a mans ride
[2024-07-30T11:11:10] Yamal: Actually, after everything that has been talked about in the group regarding chassis, I would consider the GT2 or the Inmotion RS for future projects due to the geometry issue, you have to try that! Although I don't completely love the look of both scooters for now...
[2024-07-30T11:11:58] haku: naw thier standing giant scooters still. still gay
[2024-07-30T11:12:34] Yamal: WHAT

[2024-07-30T11:13:13] haku: like a big giant gay blue man in a bowl of fruits
[2024-07-30T11:14:26] Yamal: The origin of scooters is to stand up, and I think they were born in New York, do you want me to find the ninja warrior photo for you: p?
[2024-07-30T11:14:44] haku: gay like this.
[2024-07-30T11:15:26] Yamal: Let's see what that man has to do with an e-scooter?

[2024-07-30T11:20:27] Yamal: It's your opinion haku xD
[2024-07-30T11:21:02] Yamal: I don't understand this morning attack on e-scooters😂
[2024-07-30T11:21:26] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): it's a hole in the fishnet. no way he has balls this large
[2024-07-30T11:21:36] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): it just looks like it thru the compression
[2024-07-30T11:21:55] haku: i had a nightmare on that blue guy living rent free in my head. he was riding a giant stamding scooter in my dream
[2024-07-30T11:22:14] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-07-30T11:22:31] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): you dream about dudes? pretty gay

[2024-07-30T11:22:58] haku: i woke up its 2am here
[2024-07-30T11:23:06] 🎸 POSS 🏁 (Crimekillz): nightmares are normally just a symptom of repressed memories and fantasies
[2024-07-30T11:23:25] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-07-30T11:23:33] haku: oh that makes sense. might be that too.
[2024-07-30T11:24:41] haku: in my dream he was racing in the french league
[2024-07-30T11:25:26] Yamal: 🤣

[2024-07-30T11:30:01] haku: thats elons tech then.
[2024-07-30T11:30:20] Yamal: If you don't fall asleep you can also count sheep

[2024-07-30T11:52:27] Yamal: linden infusion
[2024-07-30T11:54:51] Yamal: You have to see Aladin with some too many cakes,, you are very sensitive xD
[2024-07-30T11:55:41] Yamal: That doesn't happen to a warrior, a warrior sleeps like a lion
[2024-07-30T11:56:02] haku: im watching old ww2 documentaries to fall asleep. the time where boys were men.
[2024-07-30T11:58:20] Yamal: We'll see what your shaman says.
[2024-07-30T11:58:49] Yamal: I still haven't been able to locate mine, he's somewhere in Texas living the crazy life.
[2024-07-30T12:00:47] Jan: Thats reducing stem momentum to have a mechanically more sturdy frame

Is there anyone here who can help me set it up or take care of it completely remotely? For a fee, of course. The goal is to operate the Ubox with the m365 display.
[2024-07-30T19:29:09] Lisa: Why don’t you solder it yourself like your battery’s?

[2024-07-30T19:31:50] Tristan: I hope you dont sell this shit
[2024-07-30T19:32:55] Tristan: Ohhh...
[2024-07-30T19:33:14] crimeware: what the.... is this a bomb?
[2024-07-30T19:33:41] Tristan: No, its named a scam
[2024-07-30T19:33:53] crimeware: he is not black

[2024-07-30T19:34:02] crimeware: he is white, that's worse
[2024-07-30T19:34:25] Tristan: I distance myself from these statements
[2024-07-30T19:34:42] Mirono escooters: xD welded
[2024-07-30T19:35:02] Mirono escooters: So aggressive
[2024-07-30T19:35:23] crimeware: brother he charged him 200euros for a kaputt battery
[2024-07-30T19:35:38] Tristan: More like 270€
[2024-07-30T19:35:45] crimeware: what the hell
[2024-07-30T19:35:55] Mirono escooters: The first part had nothing to do with that
[2024-07-30T19:36:36] Mirono escooters: Also not a place in general discussion, move it somewhere else , gives me a thousand pings.
[2024-07-30T19:36:49] Tristan: Scammers should be scammed...
[2024-07-30T19:37:07] puneDir: yeah easiest and best way
[2024-07-30T19:37:12] puneDir: <photos/photo_16444@30-07-2024_19-37-12.jpg>
[2024-07-30T19:37:14] Mirono escooters: I did as well back in the day
[2024-07-30T19:37:17] puneDir: This is boring
[2024-07-30T19:37:29] puneDir: Milling the shaft was long work
[2024-07-30T19:37:31] Mirono escooters: Spacing bit fucked but it works
[2024-07-30T19:37:47] puneDir: Why?
[2024-07-30T19:37:58] puneDir: What should i improve
[2024-07-30T19:38:03] crimeware: is it a thin sheet?
[2024-07-30T19:38:12] Mirono escooters: I mean your nickel

[2024-07-30T19:38:35] Mirono escooters: Guys, we go to offtopic now :)
[2024-07-30T19:38:36] puneDir: I will weld one small one to sides
[2024-07-30T19:39:08] Mirono escooters: One way to do it
[2024-07-30T19:39:40] Mirono escooters: Control with keyboard needs to be enabled somewhere at right side
[2024-07-30T20:00:04] crimeware: the funny thing is, in Germany they were allowed to run 32kph and in us only 27 kph
[2024-07-30T20:04:32] crimeware: I have a makerbase
[2024-07-30T20:04:52] crimeware: That I haven't touched yet just added a protective film and 5mm bullet point connectors
[2024-07-30T20:09:00] Yamal: Germany and Vesc
[2024-07-30T20:13:12] Yamal: https://youtu.be/8q5p2O1OEMc?si=iuFQpNTOw2SQGqGP
[2024-07-30T20:13:12] crimeware: Those old scooters were a nieche German thing, the Germans build insanely fast scooters back in that time
[2024-07-30T20:20:46] Smart Repair: I was able to solve the problem. My next problem is to operate the dashboard and the ADC module at the same time. I currently have the dashboard on the comm connection. How do I connect the ADC module? 🤔

[2024-07-30T20:57:21] Yamal: and it's funny when we go out there and you see such hot cyclists on totally legal interurban roads, and why not us?... :(
[2024-07-30T20:57:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Here also and only 30kg scooters

[2024-07-30T22:46:55] Patrick: Here are the works of @oreohuzky, which include various batteries and other products that he made and sold. Unfortunately, he sold one of his batteries to @Arne12348868. The battery was poorly made and posed a significant safety risk, as the nickel strips were not properly secured(Proof follows). He also sells them in his escooter store in his city

[2024-07-30T22:51:16] Patrick: Yes
[2024-07-30T22:51:25] Tristan: We talked to this guy on discord
[2024-07-30T22:52:08] Tristan: he said he had checked every weld
[2024-07-30T22:52:34] Patrick: And the guy he sold the battery too doesnt know anything about batterys and then told him to try to fix it...
[2024-07-30T22:52:36] Mirono escooters: Didn't refund?
[2024-07-30T22:52:55] Tristan: he said he uses heat-resistant special tesa
[2024-07-30T22:52:59] Tristan: No
[2024-07-30T22:53:09] Patrick: No refund but wanted him to buy again lol
[2024-07-30T22:53:15] Patrick: i got screens too
[2024-07-30T22:53:28] Tristan: he wants the customer to buy new cells, bms and so on
[2024-07-30T22:53:44] Tristan: the only thing he does for free is welding
[2024-07-30T22:53:48] Patrick: <photos/photo_16469@30-07-2024_22-53-48.jpg>

[2024-07-30T22:55:50] Tristan: He did not want to apologize first, nor replace anything or admit the mistake
[2024-07-30T22:57:02] Tristan: My guy payed 270€ for this shit
[2024-07-30T22:57:13] Paolo ⁭: But I have a question, you're right that batteries are no well done. You didn't asked for some picture of his work before place order?
[2024-07-30T22:57:23] Patrick: He sells them in his local escooter store to his customers too
[2024-07-30T22:57:55] Tristan: But he didn't know anything about batteries
[2024-07-30T22:57:58] Patrick: Old pictures as we said the guy doesnt know anything about batterys and thought the battery was made propper
[2024-07-30T22:58:15] Tristan: We have only just found out all this
[2024-07-30T22:59:00] Tristan: The best thing is that he recommended the customer to fix the nickel strip again with insulating tape
[2024-07-30T22:59:45] Tristan: He still sells batteries today and we just had another case where one was broken
[2024-07-30T23:00:05] Tristan: Unfortunately we could not take a look inside because the customer sent the battery back to have it repaired
[2024-07-30T23:00:15] Paolo ⁭: Understood, try to ask him at least partial refund maybe, if you get this from local shop you can reach it and trying to complain
[2024-07-30T23:00:20] Tristan: But only after we have published all this
[2024-07-30T23:00:24] Patrick: This is how he told him to fix it
[2024-07-30T23:00:56] Patrick: Calling the owner tomorrow
[2024-07-30T23:01:11] Patrick: The guy bought it not over the store though
[2024-07-30T23:02:15] 'lekrsu': ???
[2024-07-30T23:02:23] Tristan: <video_file>
[2024-07-30T23:02:33] GABE: How low does it have to go before the general population realises this is retarded?
[2024-07-30T23:02:42] GABE: 15kmh? 12kmh? I wonder what the breaking point is
[2024-07-30T23:03:05] 'lekrsu': Sweden is also 14kmh if above 25kg
[2024-07-30T23:03:15] Mirono escooters: Wtf
[2024-07-30T23:03:19] Mirono escooters: I run faster
[2024-07-30T23:03:20] GABE: wait what, that's jogging speed.
[2024-07-30T23:03:24] 'lekrsu': But retarded rules can't be followed
[2024-07-30T23:03:36] GABE: Twice as fast for wattage peaks.
[2024-07-30T23:03:44] GABE: that 1hp 1human power
[2024-07-30T23:04:01] 'lekrsu': did y'all see goggins last runs?
[2024-07-30T23:04:15] GABE: Nah how fast did he go?

[2024-07-30T23:04:45] GABE: oh my god
[2024-07-30T23:04:51] 'lekrsu': just the distance is
[2024-07-30T23:05:07] Finn: I didnt drop it, shipping was rough for this little boy😭
[2024-07-30T23:05:11] haku: what in the name of elon
[2024-07-30T23:05:11] Mirono escooters: See, I knew i recognized it, this wasn't his

[2024-07-30T23:05:36] Tristan: He wanted to fix the nickel strip to the cells with the insulating tape to close the circuit

[2024-07-30T23:14:24] crimeware: Maybe a magic genie comes out & grants me a wish
[2024-07-30T23:14:47] crimeware: Maybe jizz in it too? ☺️

[2024-07-30T23:18:55] Finn: Why?😭😭
[2024-07-30T23:18:59] crimeware: I heard they are fun inside wet holes 🥹
[2024-07-30T23:19:25] Finn: Ohhh
[2024-07-30T23:19:40] haku: so thats how its done. nice
[2024-07-30T23:21:19] Finn: You in america try to hit a cell with a gun or smth.
[2024-07-30T23:21:23] Finn: Would be banger content
[2024-07-30T23:21:33] 'lekrsu': lipo is cheaper than fireworks

[2024-07-30T23:22:33] Finn: I have old cells, when they last till winter i will load them to 4.25V and then drop a anvil on it
[2024-07-30T23:22:53] Finn: Drop it into a fire or smth for extra boom effect
[2024-07-30T23:22:56] 'lekrsu': good idea
[2024-07-30T23:23:15] 'lekrsu': fire to unleash the fire within
[2024-07-30T23:24:01] haku: ammo is expensive nowadays. have to hoard it. ill try this technique instead of shorting
[2024-07-30T23:32:25] GABE: Maybe possible to split atoms that makeup jizz and make a small nuclear reactor that Is a literall cum guzzler
[2024-07-30T23:32:50] GABE: it wouldn't be very efficient, though, because carbon.
[2024-07-30T23:34:43] GABE: oh nevermind, the base must be radioactive. sad. Infact the carbon is used to slow down nuclear reactions
[2024-07-30T23:41:50] crimeware: Good thing is, I can produce massive amount of cum
[2024-07-30T23:42:19] crimeware: Issue is, I don't think people wanna see me jorking it and by it I mean my peanutis

[2024-07-31T00:12:56] haku: ill give it a try.
[2024-07-31T00:34:15] Face de Pin Sucé: Do you guys find it beautiful?
[2024-07-31T00:41:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSYwJeT2K/ Hhhaaa
[2024-07-31T01:43:34] haku: holy crap wtf. olympics let a man beat up a woman in boxing. disgraceful
[2024-07-31T01:46:14] haku: i just want to see real sportsmanship. not this crap. if this is possible let me in the next games. im ready to wrestle the ladies
[2024-07-31T02:41:51] haku: here ya go. check out algeria vs mexico boxing olympics.
[2024-07-31T02:42:31] haku: the mexican girl did not have a chance. knocked down a few times.
[2024-07-31T02:47:46] haku: thats the only way brother. this is ridicoulous
[2024-07-31T02:49:05] haku: sad to see these female athletes get a once in a lifetime chance to compete in the olympics and get destroyed by a dude
[2024-07-31T02:51:09] haku: elon will find a cure. dont worry
[2024-07-31T02:54:20] Noname: Found on temu it's the "Ryan" scooter
[2024-07-31T02:57:17] haku: nvm this a IBA photo not the olympic one. but he still in the olympics in woman category
[2024-07-31T04:23:21] haku: the spintend 85/200 can push 250 phase yea? can it do more?
[2024-07-31T04:26:08] haku: its a little wide like the lady in the olympic opening
[2024-07-31T04:39:33] haku: im doing the math. its atleast 200 dc yea?
[2024-07-31T04:41:20] haku: 12p p42. 2x12fet spintend good combo i think. so i need atleast a 500a bms
[2024-07-31T04:43:31] haku: if i have my main battery 12p p42 can i still add a different brand for a range extender like a 10p 40t?
[2024-07-31T04:45:54] haku: would the different cell capacity be an issue even if i have 2 different bms
[2024-07-31T04:51:35] Noname: I have 3 different size and make batterys one different voltage with 3 different bms connected. Worst case is they balance with a few amps for a minute.
[2024-07-31T04:52:51] Noname: Like many people pulling a rope. People of different strengths but all still pulling rope
[2024-07-31T04:54:59] Noname: Only problem is if pulling mad amps and 1 bms goes down you instantly murder the others. Protection prob kick in and shut down everything
[2024-07-31T04:55:13] Noname: Small chances though
[2024-07-31T04:58:52] haku: one bms for 40t10p will be 325peak the p42 12p will have 500something peak. should they be both pulling the same amps?
[2024-07-31T05:02:52] Jeferson Rodriguez: Hello, forgive my ignorance regarding the wiring of the flipsky 75100, where does it go exactly?
[2024-07-31T05:08:49] Noname: More amps.off the bigger battery
[2024-07-31T05:11:43] Noname: The fuck you planning on pulling 835 amps with?
[2024-07-31T05:25:06] haku: no im thinking of range extender and if i can use the full power of my 12fet
[2024-07-31T05:25:53] haku: i have the motors to power it. i wont be riding it balls to the walls. i just want to make sure it has the juice
[2024-07-31T05:32:45] haku: thats good to know. thanks
[2024-07-31T05:37:27] Noname: Idk there's overdoing it then there's haku'ing it
[2024-07-31T05:40:07] haku: im trying to find a use for my 40t thats why i went with 72v i already have conponents for it
[2024-07-31T05:40:28] haku: i dont want to dissasemble that beautiful battery.
[2024-07-31T05:41:04] Noname: Planning murder for cells 🤪
[2024-07-31T05:41:41] haku: i cant believe i paid $4 a cell on those.
[2024-07-31T05:41:56] haku: p42 was 1.80
[2024-07-31T05:42:10] Noname: 10$ says you don't hit 15a per cell
[2024-07-31T05:42:26] Noname: With 20s22p
[2024-07-31T05:43:22] haku: lol maybe but the extra range on it is nice. the storage box fits it perfectly
[2024-07-31T05:44:13] Noname: So run out of juice further out in the 🏜
[2024-07-31T05:44:22] Noname: Great plan
[2024-07-31T05:44:45] Noname: Your carcas won't stink up the town
[2024-07-31T05:44:52] haku: i really think this project wil be the only one finished. ive always been eying this framw
[2024-07-31T05:45:01] Noname: We know
[2024-07-31T05:45:14] Noname: Prob jerked on the Pic of it by now
[2024-07-31T05:45:55] haku: i keep asking the vendor wierd questions. i think shes done talking to me haha
[2024-07-31T05:46:37] Noname: That's weird

[2024-07-31T05:53:19] haku: is mp2 a good vesc?
[2024-07-31T07:28:07] Jason: yes
[2024-07-31T07:32:05] crimeware: It's called feminism & they demand equality. So the men agreed to the TOS of equality
[2024-07-31T07:33:25] crimeware: <photos/photo_16475@31-07-2024_07-33-25.jpg>
[2024-07-31T07:58:24] haku: i know funny how that worked out for them. these athletes arent feminists though. they just want to compete in the world stage.
[2024-07-31T07:59:49] haku: the match is going to be this thursday. algeria vs italy. lets see how fair it will be
[2024-07-31T08:44:57] puneDir: cengiz and elshans 3 am fun 😅

[2024-07-31T12:19:15] GABE: The coil is broken so this guy just threw it
[2024-07-31T12:21:50] 'lekrsu': What is it even
[2024-07-31T12:21:55] FreehandZ: I read this, I am intrigued. What's the context?
[2024-07-31T12:21:58] GABE: THC Vape
[2024-07-31T12:23:59] GABE: it's a live rosin one
[2024-07-31T12:31:16] GABE: Coil has continuity, so the control board is dead. Time to swap it out and get high.
[2024-07-31T12:31:48] GABE: eh, I could also just chief it mechanically, I think I'll go with that option.
[2024-07-31T12:34:51] GABE: OH MY GOD IT HITS SO WELL HAHAHAHHAA Nah I'm so fucking stoned OFF ONE HIT LOL

[2024-07-31T16:02:11] GABE: 80100 Fits there without the shell
[2024-07-31T16:03:10] GABE: 100 possible with BMS on bottom and no spacers, or with even if u cut
[2024-07-31T16:03:55] GABE: If you cut the metal lips here in red, you can place the cell on the rails and fit more You can fit the escs and BMS on top
[2024-07-31T16:14:24] Patrick: 0 chance with 21700 in a normal layout
[2024-07-31T16:15:08] Patrick: Fitting 80Cells with a normal layout already pain

[2024-07-31T16:20:34] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No .. maybe a spacer on the disc. ?
[2024-07-31T16:20:38] GABE: I meant to say abnormal layout.

[2024-07-31T16:23:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Will not help as u can see here
[2024-07-31T16:23:51] GABE: you have to change the dimensions of the STL to match the new bottom apart thats grinded, so it's thinner and more adjusted to the thread holes while being thinner
[2024-07-31T16:24:58] GABE: You also have to grind a tiny bit off the round part, the 2 little parts that stand out.

[2024-07-31T16:27:38] GABE: no resistance issues
[2024-07-31T16:28:01] Patrick: Warping is a big problem but with the heated chamber it worked, its asa cf harder to print then normal asa and also expensive but 0 chance i am breaking it
[2024-07-31T16:28:10] GABE: With no external
[2024-07-31T16:29:18] Patrick: Still hurts to know that 750g cost 50€...
[2024-07-31T16:29:50] Patrick: More then double the price from the normal asa
[2024-07-31T16:30:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Need spacer only on disc bolts maybe
[2024-07-31T16:30:10] haku: yea thats a bit much but worth it for really hot conditions
[2024-07-31T16:30:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also why the walls ?
[2024-07-31T16:30:44] haku: what brand asa cf is it?

[2024-07-31T16:34:17] haku: how smaller is the xiaomi frame compared to g30. that might be a better conceal carry scooter
[2024-07-31T16:35:40] haku: are parts also interchangable? can you out 10"vsett motors on them?
[2024-07-31T16:39:14] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: inflated or deflated?

[2024-07-31T17:15:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But will try inflating after getting caliper in position
[2024-07-31T17:26:33] Smart Repair: Can anyone tell me why the engine cracks when accelerating and braking? Ubox and 65H engine
[2024-07-31T17:39:38] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: With the English tire it becomes narrower, try it
[2024-07-31T17:41:21] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'll try but also maybe use smaller disc
[2024-07-31T17:41:43] GABE: is there a bms that fits at the round part of the g30 when used with 20s6p?
[2024-07-31T17:41:55] GABE: horizontally of course.
[2024-07-31T17:42:18] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: test by inflating the tire only
[2024-07-31T17:45:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: K
[2024-07-31T17:46:29] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Put air in the tire and test everything, it will be easier for you
[2024-07-31T17:46:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: After fitting caliper?
[2024-07-31T17:49:19] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: First put air in and you'll see how easy it is.

[2024-07-31T19:57:15] GABE: Can make a 20s6p from the 18650s then, too. So I'll have 2 ninebot scoots. 1 pro 2 with 17s6p or 13s8p, and 1 g30 with 20s6p And the ebike battery will be hot swappable with the pro 2 batt. I made it that way
[2024-07-31T19:57:21] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What ? To switch on off ?

[2024-07-31T20:28:11] GABE: I find making packs particilarly easy
[2024-07-31T20:28:16] GABE: taking them apart, however.

The agreed solution is that the buyer will receive the money for the repair, and I will document the process for the next battery I build for myself.
[2024-07-31T20:34:45] haku: good man for owning up.

[2024-07-31T23:01:04] Noname: Damn you and your easy city food delivering job. I want to but wouldn't work here, would have to go to city eeww
[2024-07-31T23:03:01] haku: still working but broke once. now it wont charge fully to 6v i can only weld at 5.4v
[2024-07-31T23:04:13] Paolo ⁭: Technically is safer
[2024-07-31T23:04:21] Paolo ⁭: Caps works at 2.7v nominal
[2024-07-31T23:04:29] Paolo ⁭: But why you don't weld copper directly
[2024-07-31T23:05:07] haku: i tried that. its a hit and miss not all welds are perfect. it blows holes thru copper and battery
[2024-07-31T23:05:59] haku: or its a weak weld.
[2024-07-31T23:06:32] haku: best way i found out is with steel. very strong weld. hard to come off.
[2024-07-31T23:06:36] Noname: Worcester sucks the streets suck but it's 15mi away. Boston would be a money grab but 50mi away
[2024-07-31T23:07:08] haku: yea boston would be great but damn. 50miles
[2024-07-31T23:07:31] haku: good weather there too.

[2024-07-31T23:09:28] Noname: Yeah boring with no place to go.
[2024-07-31T23:09:33] haku: it should work without the adapter i think. aslomg as its plastic. cardboard spools need those
[2024-07-31T23:09:45] Finn: The retract doesnt work
[2024-07-31T23:09:51] Paolo ⁭: Why American like pick up so much😂
[2024-07-31T23:09:52] haku: oh
[2024-07-31T23:09:53] Finn: Because the spool i use is smaller in diameter
[2024-07-31T23:10:46] Noname: Idk small town plenty of parking
[2024-07-31T23:10:51] haku: oh i see.
[2024-07-31T23:10:53] Noname: I hate cars
[2024-07-31T23:11:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Try a precision guided Missile like what happen in tearan
[2024-07-31T23:11:19] Finn: And the spool slides onto front motor driven round rubber wheels that rolls the roll😭
[2024-07-31T23:11:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also by the way vesc tool works great on arch Linux (used it on my steam deck 😁😁😀)
[2024-07-31T23:12:08] haku: dang
[2024-07-31T23:12:12] 'lekrsu': Compiling from source, uh

[2024-07-31T23:12:51] haku: never had a small diameter spool before. always same size with less or more filament
[2024-07-31T23:13:12] احمد: Hello everyone, I’ve generic Chinese controller 45a, powered by 18s lipo battery’s. And 2000w 12 inch hub motor the speed looks to be limited to 50 km/h. Is there is any way to unlock its speed?
[2024-07-31T23:13:19] Finn: Mine are 1cm smaller
[2024-07-31T23:13:40] haku: you prolly have to re roll that on the stock bambu spools
[2024-07-31T23:14:40] Rogerio Figueiredo: Hello guys

[2024-07-31T23:32:47] احمد: VESC/scooter, isn’t?

[2024-07-31T23:34:56] احمد: And what’s the problem? Asking for help with no referral to specific individual.
[2024-07-31T23:35:36] haku: my idea is make the same pattern with the printed holders and put it ontop of the pack after the first weld then mark the weld points
[2024-07-31T23:36:43] haku: idk if that makes sense
[2024-07-31T23:53:14] Noname: Yeah I used tape and a sharpee but I don't have a fancy printer
[2024-07-31T23:54:50] haku: you prolly can trace the center it with the plastic holders
[2024-07-31T23:55:15] Noname: Holders who's got space for those
[2024-07-31T23:56:06] haku: speaking of holders i have a bunch from ali. i need to sell it. its the good ones too

[2024-08-01T21:16:11] haku: naw dude just flush cut is enough
[2024-08-01T21:17:18] haku: maybe with some strong copper welds sticking out that might help

[2024-08-02T11:13:24] Rogerio Figueiredo: I would love to have a cruise control work like original xiaomi and ninebot don't want add extra unnecessary buttons for it
[2024-08-02T11:13:33] Rogerio Figueiredo: But I never saw a code that works
[2024-08-02T11:19:10] Jason: hmm

[2024-08-02T14:42:51] puneDir: Nickel sizes doesnt match up
[2024-08-02T14:42:53] puneDir: Thats why
[2024-08-02T14:45:36] crimeware: You guys don't wear gloves?

[2024-08-02T14:53:11] puneDir: Im going to weld another nickel on it
[2024-08-02T14:53:31] puneDir: its not an issue
[2024-08-02T14:53:33] GABE: oh I thought that was like the other guy who sold a battery like that

[2024-08-02T14:55:47] GABE: Can I just use pliers to attach a 6awg cable on this, to route it to the Internal 10s
[2024-08-02T14:55:54] Unknown: Hi Someone can tell me why with ORTEGA ORIGINAL all good but speed not enough And in other observer mxmilian or something like that, the speed perfect but the controllers dies in few days? Im talking about HUB MOTORS
[2024-08-02T14:55:58] GABE: No solder no weld
[2024-08-02T14:56:12] GABE: is the controller VESC?
[2024-08-02T14:56:33] Unknown: Fliosky 75200 v2 pro Little 800w motors (inokim ox)
[2024-08-02T15:02:49] Unknown: In ortega original never happening but less power Some solution? I have more 12 of them in stock, some advice with the shitsky?
[2024-08-02T15:03:35] Unknown: Maybe something else i can do for it will be work better with this observer? Or anither one? Thanks
[2024-08-02T15:04:01] crimeware: Solution: Buy UBOX
[2024-08-02T15:04:33] crimeware: The Germans have a saying. Buy cheap, buy twice.
[2024-08-02T15:05:40] Unknown: There are good Ubox for: ? 80a battery 140a motor 110a field from 32% 220a absolute They also shity as i see over here
[2024-08-02T15:06:43] Noname: Buy once cry once. My go to for big spending
[2024-08-02T15:08:06] crimeware: The saying buy cheap, buy twice is sadly very true it just translates into you are fucking around for a second time where you could just spend the money for the thing that actually works
[2024-08-02T15:08:44] Noname: I understand
[2024-08-02T15:09:25] Noname: That's why I'm broke. Buy the good stuff not like @Bradhaku when on sale lol
[2024-08-02T15:11:11] GABE: it's true
[2024-08-02T15:14:13] Unknown: Can you advice me for spesific version? Its wierd that there diffrent bitween the flipsky 75200 v2 pro and the spinted. Becausw if im using ORTEGA ORIGINAL so 0 problems. But not always strong enough.
[2024-08-02T15:14:36] Unknown: Thanks for the help Will try to figure out the middle bitween price and quality

[2024-08-02T15:43:39] Unknown: 90-110a field yes (in ortega original observer its less then the other observers)
[2024-08-02T15:56:46] GABE: 10s8p fits with a small spacer, and the Xiaomi heatsink. No Hex layout No cutting metal no to last millimeter BS
[2024-08-02T15:56:50] GABE: On Pro 2
[2024-08-02T16:01:00] puneDir: Do 10s8p
[2024-08-02T16:01:43] GABE: Yes itll be that internal and the 3s external
[2024-08-02T16:01:54] GABE: <photos/photo_16576@02-08-2024_16-01-54.jpg>
[2024-08-02T16:02:29] GABE: But wired as same cell, tbh I could also just charge with a balance cable and just make the jbd BMS 10s But the 13s charger I have is better
[2024-08-02T16:03:17] puneDir: Make 10s and 3s different
[2024-08-02T16:03:20] puneDir: Dont use same bms
[2024-08-02T16:03:30] GABE: They are all identical cells
[2024-08-02T16:03:36] GABE: Why not put them together
[2024-08-02T16:03:55] GABE: Could charge 3s with my RC charger, easily. at 5.5A max.
[2024-08-02T16:04:11] GABE: But 13s in one would let me charge on the go in a McDonald's or smth
[2024-08-02T17:45:44] 'lekrsu': why so much flux 🍷
[2024-08-02T17:46:44] 'lekrsu': Oh really? I see 👀
[2024-08-02T17:51:01] Unknown: Because with other controllers the same motor goes around 86kmh and that what needed to get it with vesc (with ortega original observer)
[2024-08-02T18:33:43] Unknown: Other ways to increase top speed without it?
[2024-08-02T18:34:15] Unknown: And maybe you know why in no load with high field the motor doesnt stop when you stop pressing the throttle?
[2024-08-02T18:38:46] 'lekrsu': Because of the nature of what you're doing
[2024-08-02T18:38:58] 'lekrsu': Increase your supply voltage
[2024-08-02T19:21:17] Unknown: No way to solve this? Its or not enough speed or too much field?

[2024-08-02T21:39:01] haku: those are nice round cuts. how thick the copper?
[2024-08-02T21:41:44] Patrick: Thanks, it's 0.15mm cutting it is a little pain but works with some time
[2024-08-02T21:51:45] Noname: Why everyone thinks cutting copper is so dificult?
[2024-08-02T21:54:05] Noname: Use more towards pivit end not the point, more leverage. To cut inside circle lean scissors over like exiting a turn on a bike.
[2024-08-02T21:54:38] haku: mines pretty thick
[2024-08-02T21:55:03] haku: i like it to look pretty
[2024-08-02T21:55:05] Noname: Bad mental picture, add copper to sentence
[2024-08-02T21:55:15] haku: round curves
[2024-08-02T21:57:53] haku: i hammer it out with rubber mallet or soft blow hammer on the edges

[2024-08-02T23:34:59] 'lekrsu': Anyone used heat resistant silicone when assembling cells? If so, how'd you go about it?
[2024-08-02T23:38:28] puneDir: i used normal hot glue for paralels
[2024-08-02T23:38:45] puneDir: <photos/photo_16581@02-08-2024_23-38-45.jpg>
[2024-08-02T23:38:48] puneDir: works great
[2024-08-02T23:39:08] puneDir: but you need some good tape when you Finish the batt
[2024-08-02T23:39:49] puneDir: <photos/photo_16582@02-08-2024_23-39-49.jpg>

[2024-08-02T23:46:14] 'lekrsu': Yeah, done hot glue before. Gets quite tricky when going honeycomb layout.
[2024-08-02T23:46:15] puneDir: Use fishpaper too
[2024-08-02T23:46:25] 'lekrsu': Kapton²
[2024-08-02T23:46:27] puneDir: use fishpaper between series too
[2024-08-02T23:46:32] puneDir: Yes
[2024-08-02T23:46:39] puneDir: And leave some air gap with help of silicone
[2024-08-02T23:47:25] 'lekrsu': The what?
[2024-08-02T23:47:46] puneDir: air gap
[2024-08-02T23:47:57] puneDir: some space between series
[2024-08-02T23:47:57] 'lekrsu': 'with help of silicone'

[2024-08-02T23:48:54] puneDir: <photos/photo_16584@02-08-2024_23-48-54.jpg>
[2024-08-02T23:49:03] puneDir: and silicone gap
[2024-08-02T23:49:09] 'lekrsu': I don't see no silicone.
[2024-08-02T23:49:21] 'lekrsu': Failed to grasp what you meant in the first place
[2024-08-02T23:49:35] puneDir: im sleepy cant explain what im saying lol
[2024-08-02T23:49:50] puneDir: just meant use some good trusty thing between series
[2024-08-02T23:50:07] 'lekrsu': Last batt I did kapton between series groups. Can't easily do fishpaper when it bends on that layout.
[2024-08-02T23:50:16] puneDir: ah true
[2024-08-02T23:50:25] puneDir: but fishpaper might be better
[2024-08-02T23:50:42] puneDir: or use both
[2024-08-02T23:51:09] puneDir: holders is the easiest but sometimes you dont have enough space
[2024-08-02T23:51:29] 'lekrsu': 86/90 cells out without damaging the wrap. Going to re-wrap 4 and use some other used 32e cells for the remainding 30 cells.

[2024-08-04T00:44:59] Patrick: Probably starting welding tomorrow
[2024-08-04T00:46:49] Patrick: 1x 5mm² is for charge and the second is for all my extra things like dcdc and co gets a wire fuse build in too that can be switched fast

[2024-08-04T12:11:37] Patrick: Wanna buy some for my battery to protect it a little against Electrococorrosion mainly for my next battery that has a longer lifetime unlike the 40P cells
[2024-08-04T15:22:34] puneDir: <photos/photo_16610@04-08-2024_15-22-34.jpg>
[2024-08-04T16:25:00] Patrick: Is a bridge on this BMS needed?
[2024-08-04T16:25:09] Patrick: Because of the switch port i am asking
[2024-08-04T16:37:41] Finn: No?
[2024-08-04T16:37:51] Finn: You can disable the switch function
[2024-08-04T17:09:58] Patrick: Damn, kweld shows overcurrent at 1200A
[2024-08-04T17:10:41] Patrick: Anyway to fix it? I mean shouldnt trigger at only 1200A
[2024-08-04T17:12:04] Patrick: Ah no my bad wrong cable lenght
[2024-08-04T18:04:20] Patrick: Rounded the edges on all the nickel&copper, doing the same for the piece from the balancer part also soldering first before welding ofcourse
[2024-08-04T18:04:20] Patrick: <photos/photo_16613@04-08-2024_18-04-20.jpg>
[2024-08-04T19:08:05] Paolo ⁭: Put longer cable
[2024-08-04T19:16:08] Patrick: Fixed it had the wrong lenght
[2024-08-04T19:16:19] Patrick: My first setup had 2 car batterys
[2024-08-04T19:16:49] Patrick: Except for 2 parts i am pretty happy for my first battery currently.

[2024-08-04T19:17:45] Lisa: Looks clean
[2024-08-04T19:17:58] Patrick: The one nickel part should have been on the other side so i i could place the balancer in the middle not that important but looks better. And on the 3 i cut a little bit to much off
[2024-08-04T19:18:18] Patrick: Had to recut the copper didnt feel save with the small gaps between the copper
[2024-08-04T19:18:47] Patrick: Overall more then enough for what the battery will be used for
[2024-08-04T19:31:28] haku: very nice
[2024-08-04T19:35:09] cihan: Can Glitter 801D weld 0.3mm pure nickel?
[2024-08-04T19:38:20] Paolo ⁭: Stock wire rofl
[2024-08-04T19:38:27] Paolo ⁭: Cable will catch fite
[2024-08-04T19:42:16] Patrick: Maybe switching them once i have condensators for the welder
[2024-08-04T19:42:31] Patrick: Currently the only thing that gets hot is my lipo

[2024-08-04T21:35:57] haku: nice
[2024-08-04T21:36:19] haku: do you know your scooter well that you can wheelie and jump stairs?
[2024-08-04T21:41:58] Yamal: jumping stairs is no mystery..., but it's not good for any scooter, I had the wheelies very well with my old dualtron thunder, with the nami I started practicing until I screwed up the front shock absorber, so stop! ^^'
[2024-08-04T21:56:11] Paolo ⁭: Yes

[2024-08-04T22:48:43] NetworkDir: 🤷‍♂️ i use on 20s + fwk also i abuse with regen my peak voltage like 86V
[2024-08-04T22:49:28] Paolo ⁭: 10inch super low kv
[2024-08-04T22:49:30] Paolo ⁭: Normal
[2024-08-04T22:49:35] Paolo ⁭: And small power
[2024-08-04T22:50:24] NetworkDir: idk
[2024-08-04T23:00:20] Paolo ⁭: Yes, but anyway flipsky is better XD
[2024-08-04T23:00:46] Paolo ⁭: That's consequences of using random super performance fet without proper testing
[2024-08-04T23:01:44] Paolo ⁭: All these china fet has fake datasheet, their tests are no reliable
[2024-08-04T23:01:54] Paolo ⁭: Already discovered like 3 fet with fake specs
[2024-08-04T23:03:15] Paolo ⁭: Thermal conductivity:)
[2024-08-04T23:04:46] Paolo ⁭: I don't knoe, anyway huayi is much more tested and reliable, and parameters are real
[2024-08-04T23:05:06] Paolo ⁭: JJmicro has faked datasheet, we measured crss and is super fake
[2024-08-04T23:05:41] Paolo ⁭: You've professional oscilloscope?
[2024-08-04T23:06:02] Paolo ⁭: Yes, but rdson isn't crss ahaha
[2024-08-04T23:06:42] Paolo ⁭: This fet is too good to be real :)
[2024-08-04T23:07:31] Paolo ⁭: Why you are so fixed with the switching speed
[2024-08-04T23:07:41] Paolo ⁭: This is last problem of these MOSFET
[2024-08-04T23:07:56] Paolo ⁭: Huayi is already overkill
[2024-08-04T23:08:14] Paolo ⁭: Some years ago the best we could find was 2mR infineon
[2024-08-04T23:11:46] Paolo ⁭: Actually with 20kw setup it don't goes more than 40 c
[2024-08-04T23:13:26] Paolo ⁭: I don't understand

[2024-08-04T23:36:49] Jan: I guess 85250 beta box has those?
[2024-08-04T23:38:19] Jan: Yeah motor cables are issues, i hope they somehow can change them to better ones
[2024-08-04T23:38:57] Jan: Interesting
[2024-08-04T23:39:30] Jan: True that
[2024-08-04T23:39:42] Jan: Yeah, i probably wont do it
[2024-08-04T23:40:22] Jan: It bothers me that there is just one motor manufacturer that does performance motors
[2024-08-04T23:41:11] Jan: Yeah
[2024-08-04T23:42:32] Jan: Better magnets, better cables, watercooling versions, tubeless versions, etc
[2024-08-04T23:43:23] Paolo ⁭: What kind of battery he have lol
[2024-08-04T23:45:06] Paolo ⁭: How you do 3.2kwh with 6p
[2024-08-04T23:46:37] Paolo ⁭: If the current is correct the wh is correct to
[2024-08-04T23:48:16] Jan: very low switching frequency and then freespin
[2024-08-04T23:48:23] Jan: XD
[2024-08-04T23:48:52] Jan: Top speed is about 136kmh at 20kW max
[2024-08-04T23:49:15] Jan: The cells are the limiting factor
[2024-08-04T23:49:36] Jan: 2x 85250 and the 550A peak BMS would do quite more than 300A peak
[2024-08-04T23:50:10] Jan: Needs 40PL or P50B
[2024-08-04T23:50:45] Jan: If i ever build one again then 40PL
[2024-08-04T23:51:09] Jan: But its already quite alright from the power for me, no need to prove 35kW feasability for now. Other projects more important
[2024-08-04T23:51:21] Jan: Also other projects much more challenging
[2024-08-04T23:52:05] Jan: Makes only sense to build smaller with it
[2024-08-04T23:52:35] Paolo ⁭: Low switching frequency don't make ur battery bigger😂
[2024-08-04T23:52:38] Jan: lmao charge and discharge
[2024-08-04T23:52:54] Jan: But vescs show then very high Power values
[2024-08-04T23:52:59] Face de Pin Sucé: 35KW on 10inch ?
[2024-08-04T23:53:15] Jan: Technically feasable for G30 no external, 30mm floor extension
[2024-08-04T23:53:40] Face de Pin Sucé: Feasable, not reachable
[2024-08-04T23:53:53] Paolo ⁭: With those motor temperature I've doubt so haha
[2024-08-04T23:54:06] Jan: Needs watercooled motors
[2024-08-04T23:54:16] Face de Pin Sucé: You can cool as much as you want your motors
[2024-08-04T23:54:35] Paolo ⁭: 35kw and 20C motor in 65km and 3000Wh drawn is impossible
[2024-08-04T23:54:50] Jan: Assumption was 40PL good for 80A
[2024-08-04T23:54:53] Face de Pin Sucé: You won't reach 35KW, no matter the controller you put or the battery With 10inch
[2024-08-04T23:55:10] Paolo ⁭: Its possible
[2024-08-04T23:55:15] Face de Pin Sucé: It's not
[2024-08-04T23:55:19] Paolo ⁭: But not for long time
[2024-08-04T23:55:19] Jan: I disagree tbh
[2024-08-04T23:55:32] Face de Pin Sucé: Maybe it is at 160Kmh, MAYBE
[2024-08-04T23:55:33] Jan: On a shorter peak its feasable
[2024-08-04T23:55:53] Jan: That would also be about the topspeed from calculations
[2024-08-04T23:55:56] Paolo ⁭: It is, you don't need reach full speed for it
[2024-08-04T23:56:04] Face de Pin Sucé: Then it's not
[2024-08-04T23:56:13] Paolo ⁭: Just put fucking much field weakening + mtpa
[2024-08-04T23:56:21] Paolo ⁭: Then you reach immediately
[2024-08-04T23:56:22] Face de Pin Sucé: You will never have the grip to reach the power needed
[2024-08-04T23:56:34] Jan: 45kV 10inch motors can do 160kmh just without FW
[2024-08-04T23:57:05] Paolo ⁭: You can just put a lot of field weakening, then high power will be absorbed
[2024-08-04T23:57:14] Face de Pin Sucé: I tell you that, because, with some bigger scooter with much more grip and 11inches, it is already complicated to reach 35KW
[2024-08-04T23:57:22] Jan: hmm interesting take, that could be calculated
[2024-08-04T23:57:40] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, then just put a 66x1 motor and you will also reach it
[2024-08-04T23:57:50] Face de Pin Sucé: But I mean "in normal ways" usable power
[2024-08-04T23:57:51] Jan: 33x2 already enough
[2024-08-04T23:58:09] Face de Pin Sucé: Put a 300Kg weight on your 10inch scooter and you will also reach 35KW
[2024-08-04T23:59:10] Face de Pin Sucé: If you put a normal people of 75KG on a 10inch scooter and do a full acceleration with 33x2 motor, even 75H one, you won't reach 35KW
[2024-08-04T23:59:21] Paolo ⁭: Actually 30kw is possible with no fw, for 35 need just add field weakening
[2024-08-04T23:59:25] Face de Pin Sucé: Or maybe past 160Kmh, and it is a big maybe to me
[2024-08-04T23:59:28] Jan: If grip is the issue then maybe not
[2024-08-04T23:59:40] Face de Pin Sucé: Grip is the main issue
[2024-08-04T23:59:43] Jan: 10X3 e fire is a small tire
[2024-08-04T23:59:48] Face de Pin Sucé: And amount of power is also
[2024-08-05T00:00:07] Paolo ⁭: 30 to 35kw is no big difference really
[2024-08-05T00:00:08] Jan: BMS Controller Motor could just handle it
[2024-08-05T00:00:15] Paolo ⁭: <photos/photo_16619@05-08-2024_00-00-15.jpg>
[2024-08-05T00:00:20] Paolo ⁭: That's 10inch no fw
[2024-08-05T00:00:23] Face de Pin Sucé: I tell you, reaching 35KW with 11inch and 60Kg scooter with 22S batteries up to 164Kmh is already complicated to reach 35KW
[2024-08-05T00:00:37] NetworkDir: anyone builded vesc express?
[2024-08-05T00:00:38] NetworkDir: with gps
[2024-08-05T00:00:43] Face de Pin Sucé: It's a big difference
[2024-08-05T00:00:57] Paolo ⁭: If I add field weakening I can teach it
[2024-08-05T00:01:10] Jan: I think there are other areas in scooter development than just more and more power
[2024-08-05T00:01:10] Face de Pin Sucé: This is like 1ms spike from VESC
[2024-08-05T00:01:29] Jan: As said i wont go anyway for a 35kW G30 build anytime soon
[2024-08-05T00:01:54] Jan: The costs are again probably 4-5k € again and i have two other projects running
[2024-08-05T00:02:15] NetworkDir: 50kW pro2 would best
[2024-08-05T00:02:44] Paolo ⁭: You will never get continuos power of vesc registered peak 😂
[2024-08-05T00:02:54] Paolo ⁭: Motor would melt instantly

[2024-08-05T00:07:25] Face de Pin Sucé: You can see that already at 135Kmh power is going down while speed is increasing

[2024-08-05T17:26:53] puneDir: is 3 enough?
[2024-08-05T17:27:03] Patrick: Only waiting for 4 Support parts letting it balance over night
[2024-08-05T17:29:32] Mirono escooters: No
[2024-08-05T17:31:27] 'lekrsu': At least you won't need to continue reinforcing the parallel groups themselves on the remaining groups, just do every series connection instead.
[2024-08-05T17:32:02] puneDir: 4?
[2024-08-05T17:32:15] puneDir: i will cuz i want them to look same :(

[2024-08-05T22:55:11] Finn: And very thick wires. How much amps are you planning ?
[2024-08-05T22:58:17] cihan: What are your thoughts about getting Glitter 811H over 801D? Is it worth the extra 90 USD? I think I'll be never pulling more than 9A from any battery pack I'll be building in the future and 0.3mm nickel or equivalent copper will be enough for me.
[2024-08-05T22:58:33] cihan: I mean 9A per cell.
[2024-08-05T22:59:33] haku: do not do it.
[2024-08-05T22:59:41] haku: get a kweld
[2024-08-05T23:00:37] haku: spend 500 on that piece of junk. broke down
[2024-08-05T23:01:05] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Right now my battery doesn't have much discharge, it's a 22s11p with lgM50lt 160a, we're thinking of making a new one with molicel p45b, the same in 22s11p we would have 495A
[2024-08-05T23:02:43] Patrick: How much copper can the Kweld even do with 500Joule? Is 0.3mm in total with nickel and copper really the max?
[2024-08-05T23:03:02] cihan: I saw some of your messages on Glitter 811H. How did it break down? Does Glitter have quality issues? Maybe I should also stay away from 801D? James liked it as I've read on past messages.
[2024-08-05T23:04:07] Patrick: 0.15mm copper is easy with the kWeld at only 75Joule
[2024-08-05T23:05:42] haku: my 811h had some qc issues. mosfets had to be changed. now it wont charge to the full 6v just 5.4v. its still welding but it was a hassle when fixing it
[2024-08-05T23:06:48] haku: the only good thing about it it has no problems welding .2 copper on .2 nickle/steel without overheating. i think kweld can do that too
[2024-08-05T23:07:14] cihan: Thank you. Is kweld only battery operated?
[2024-08-05T23:07:24] Patrick: Hi, maybe someone can help me with update the tronic 250R? It would be very important. I am only scared make something wrong 😇
[2024-08-05T23:07:47] haku: you can use capacitors or battery i think
[2024-08-05T23:07:48] Patrick: I have the correct vesc tool at windows and android

[2024-08-05T23:08:45] haku: idk if 801d has issues like 811h.
[2024-08-05T23:12:07] cihan: I just saw, they also sell a capacitor module too. Capacitor could be better choice but I'll need more than 2 capacitors for high currents. 801D claims to deliver 1800A peak current. Kweld delivers like 1600A with best 12V battery. Is description for 801D fake? 801D comes with 25mm^2 welding pen and it's thinnest one available from glitter, there are also much thicker options on their website.
[2024-08-05T23:12:45] haku: im not sure about kweld but alot of users here with good experience
[2024-08-05T23:13:13] haku: also 801d too
[2024-08-05T23:15:35] haku: i think im the only idiot who bought the 811h
[2024-08-05T23:17:35] cihan: 811H has some good reviews on YouTube. But they don't test the mosfets for long term usage. So it's not really possible to say how long mosfets will survive.
[2024-08-05T23:18:14] haku: i might also be a beta tester too. might be different now
[2024-08-05T23:20:37] Patrick: The capacitor modul from kWeld isnt that good from what i heard but for most people its enough.
[2024-08-05T23:21:08] cihan: Maybe. Kweld comes with 8AWG welding pen as claimed on website. Isn't it too thin?
[2024-08-05T23:21:44] Patrick: The only thing that gets hot for me is the lipo
[2024-08-05T23:21:49] haku: no idea
[2024-08-05T23:21:58] crimeware: Pp
[2024-08-05T23:22:26] Patrick: Bro was too hot
[2024-08-05T23:22:41] crimeware: Spezi ☺️
[2024-08-05T23:23:53] haku: yea thats the only thing about kweld ive read. it gets too hot to weld continious
[2024-08-05T23:24:04] haku: atleast it doesnt break
[2024-08-05T23:24:22] cihan: Kweld has 8AWG cable. Is it enough. I thought 4AWG or thicker could be better.
[2024-08-05T23:28:53] Patrick: Just left it in the sun, with the speed i weld nothing gets hot
[2024-08-05T23:29:42] Patrick: For me more then enough, i just precut my copper in the time i cut the nickel everything is fine
[2024-08-05T23:30:08] Patrick: At 3x 75Joule welds its only a little bit warm
[2024-08-05T23:59:15] Paolo ⁭: For small hobby battery is ok
[2024-08-05T23:59:31] Paolo ⁭: When you do much it's no good
[2024-08-06T00:09:55] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/SOoTxy7pBMI?si=tOhYuVt2d-2mORAQ
[2024-08-06T00:10:42] Paolo ⁭: The bullshit of kweld is if you put battery in parallel for heat less lipo, the over current error will be triggered
[2024-08-06T00:11:04] Paolo ⁭: If you put good capacitors, will happen the same
[2024-08-06T00:12:40] haku: thats pretty cool
[2024-08-06T00:32:46] cihan: What's your opinion between kweld and Glitter 801D for 0.3mm nickel and also for copper /copper sandwich?
[2024-08-06T00:34:09] cihan: I can get Glitter 801D for 240 USD from Banggood including tax. Is it too much for 801D? Kweld is problematic to get via post since it exceeds import amount of 150 euros.
[2024-08-06T00:34:21] cihan: I'll also need to buy battery for Kweld.
[2024-08-06T00:50:23] Paolo ⁭: I left the spot weldinf
[2024-08-06T00:51:04] Paolo ⁭: Tig is much better, much more efficient, no heat issue, no power limit ( I weld under 5% of the power)
[2024-08-06T00:52:32] Paolo ⁭: You can understand how many spot welder I bought😂
[2024-08-06T00:53:33] Paolo ⁭: Sunkko 737 , 709ad+, malecteics, kweld, glitter 811, and some of Chinese AliExpress
[2024-08-06T00:53:44] Face de Pin Sucé: I also want a tig setup x)
[2024-08-06T00:54:17] Paolo ⁭: You can buy the pulse board on AliExpress and connect with a tig machine
[2024-08-06T00:54:59] Paolo ⁭: https://a.aliexpress.com/_m03N2uC
[2024-08-06T00:55:06] Face de Pin Sucé: I was going to ask for link
[2024-08-06T00:57:28] Paolo ⁭: He was using continuos pulsing and was using high power
[2024-08-06T00:58:05] Paolo ⁭: So if you weld many time in the same point without pause the cell will melt
[2024-08-06T01:00:45] Paolo ⁭: <video_file>
[2024-08-06T01:00:56] Noname: Would mig work if you swapped to a tig handle?
[2024-08-06T01:00:59] Paolo ⁭: I prefer to use single pulse and don't risk :)
[2024-08-06T01:01:28] Paolo ⁭: I don't know how mig works :(
[2024-08-06T01:02:27] Noname: Basically same but auto wire feed instead of a rod
[2024-08-06T01:04:02] Noname: Idk mabey ill take a piece of tungsten from work and smash it in a copper tip make a backwoods tig
[2024-08-06T01:19:34] haku: that guy really die? i thought you guys were trolling
[2024-08-06T01:26:12] haku: dam. death by battery welding
[2024-08-06T01:26:14] 'lekrsu': not because of the cells right?
[2024-08-06T01:35:58] haku: ive punctured some cells with my glitter thank elon im safe.
[2024-08-06T01:53:32] haku: how often does that happen. puncture a cell and it explodes? maybe it wont happen with a spot welder
[2024-08-06T02:16:05] Lisa: It used cells maybe you use an grinder to get the old nickel strips away and then you grind to much away
[2024-08-06T02:16:30] Lisa: Happend to a friend He welded and in the same second the cell caught fire
[2024-08-06T02:16:47] Lisa: Luckily everything went well and I think he tossed the battery outside haha
[2024-08-06T02:18:06] 'lekrsu': They're thin, don't grind, eh
[2024-08-06T02:18:58] Lisa: Yep 👍🏼
[2024-08-06T02:44:58] Patrick: Hope so need to do the outputs again tryed to get most of the old welds away should be fine like this i hope

[2024-08-06T02:49:20] haku: my welder unpredictable
[2024-08-06T02:49:53] haku: i had it happen a few times with test welds
[2024-08-06T02:53:10] 'lekrsu': the hell
[2024-08-06T02:53:16] 'lekrsu': dangerous
[2024-08-06T02:54:40] haku: this is with .2 copper and .2 nickle steel too.
[2024-08-06T02:55:23] haku: i need to get a kweld. room with some batteries cant gamble

[2024-08-06T11:11:57] haku: whaf does it say?
[2024-08-06T11:14:32] 'lekrsu': 30eur max for parcels I think
[2024-08-06T11:23:09] puneDir: 30 euro max if you gonna buy smth
[2024-08-06T11:27:50] puneDir: im fucked
[2024-08-06T11:28:44] 'lekrsu': You buy it within Turkey ig
[2024-08-06T11:33:51] cihan: Recently temu made a good discount for new members and there were so many orders. Temu also charges customs tax as stoppage during payment. So almost all packages were somehow accepted by customs even though the value of items inside exceeded 150 euros. (former customs regulation allowed importing of goods whose value doesn't exceed 150 euros). So the new regulation was probably made because government didn't like so many temu orders.
[2024-08-06T11:34:31] cihan: Package will be rejected at customs and resent to the sender.
[2024-08-06T11:38:15] cihan: Central Bank is in debt and lacking USD. They don't want to let citizens spend in USD. This doesn't include oligarchs and companies who pay no tax to the state though.)
[2024-08-06T11:41:21] cihan: They used to in the past. Lately economy went worse and worse and government tries to limit USD escaping country.
[2024-08-06T11:42:03] cihan: James, you cannot understand it. Logic left Turkey long ago with this government.)
[2024-08-06T11:48:41] cihan: Someone sells Turkish lira and buys USD to pay for something he buys from abroad. So Turkish lira loses value. Government tries to keep Turkish lira valuable until enough carry trade investors bring their money to Turkey. Many will leave Turkey if Turkish lira keeps losing value. I wish bank of Japan will raise rates furthermore and all those carry trade investors leave Turkey so government will not be able to control Turkish lira anymore. So more citizens will vote against the government.
[2024-08-06T11:49:58] cihan: More than 30% of my past friends from high school, university left Turkey already. More will leave probably.
[2024-08-06T11:58:54] cihan: Most of those big importers are government oligarchs and tax on certain goods is reduced for a very short time to let them import without tax, then tax is increased again. Or those oligarchs don't pay the tax and the state excuses the tax of those companies. Most of the tax payers in Turkey are people who work with salary, biggest tax income of the state is not tax obtained from income of individuals but indirect taxes.
[2024-08-06T12:00:01] cihan: Yes, they pay in USD but those companies need to be subsidized by the citizens.
[2024-08-06T12:01:27] NetworkDir: 5 product limit 30€ per product max Also VAT 18% -> 30% Basically clown Also instagram banned with shitty reason :)
[2024-08-06T12:02:18] cihan: They do it on alcohol and tobacco products. They're very expensive for average income in Turkey. Problem is laws don't work for everyone. Laws are only for citizens not for government members.

[2024-08-06T13:45:59] cihan: I just ask to be sure before placing order . Can 801D weld 0.15 copper + 0.15 plated nickel strip?
[2024-08-06T13:59:37] haku: no. that one will be a range extender for the minibike scooter.
[2024-08-06T14:00:19] haku: when frame comes. it already shipped

[2024-08-06T14:49:28] cihan: Thanks a lot. Can it do it with the included 73B soldering pen or do you use some other lower resistance soldering cable +tip?
[2024-08-06T15:05:46] Smart Repair: the original tips are crap... I threw mine away and bought new ones... I've been super happy ever since
[2024-08-06T15:06:31] GABE: No don't do it.
[2024-08-06T15:06:42] GABE: It literally doesnt do it
[2024-08-06T15:06:54] GABE: Just get steel it's better anyway
[2024-08-06T15:06:58] GABE: 0.1
[2024-08-06T15:07:06] cihan: What are the tips you're using?
[2024-08-06T15:07:19] cihan: 0.1 steel over 0.1 copper?
[2024-08-06T15:07:40] GABE: I did use the original tips sure
[2024-08-06T15:07:55] GABE: this is stronger anyway
[2024-08-06T15:08:04] GABE: and cheaper
[2024-08-06T15:08:19] GABE: steel is like 1e for 1m
[2024-08-06T15:09:07] cihan: I can I can get 801H for 80 usd more than 801D but then it becomes too expensive. On the other hand I cannot buy goods from abroad else than banggood if the price exceeds 150 euros.
[2024-08-06T15:10:09] GABE: Yeah I guess that one would be better
[2024-08-06T15:10:22] GABE: I think it would be bettrer to just
[2024-08-06T15:10:27] GABE: make a lipo and weld with that
[2024-08-06T15:10:40] GABE: then you can order from abroad
[2024-08-06T15:10:41] Smart Repair: Ich habe gerade diesen erstaunlichen Artikel auf AliExpress gefunden. Probiere ihn aus! 10,89€ | Fit blau 5000W power spot schweißen stift https://a.aliexpress.com/_EwrKKM1
[2024-08-06T15:11:01] cihan: 320 USD for 801H seems too expensive for what it is.
[2024-08-06T15:11:35] GABE: I just made mine like that, I took the metal out
[2024-08-06T15:11:49] Smart Repair: almost 7,800W with 5p m50lt... next week there will be an update to 5p Eve 40p... let's see if I reach 10,000W
[2024-08-06T15:11:51] GABE: You can open it and make 2 pens
[2024-08-06T15:12:57] Smart Repair: I had this tip... it was really crap
[2024-08-06T15:13:15] GABE: <photos/photo_16656@06-08-2024_15-13-15.jpg>

[2024-08-06T15:14:00] Smart Repair: I haven't tried that... but I'll do it again when I get the chance and test it
[2024-08-06T15:14:45] cihan: Does 801H have any advantage over 801D else than the better tips? There's a delay button on 801H.
[2024-08-06T15:16:19] Smart Repair: then prefer kweld
[2024-08-06T15:17:49] Paolo ⁭: Nah glitter Is better
[2024-08-06T15:18:01] Paolo ⁭: Big cap Is way better than lipo
[2024-08-06T15:19:16] 'lekrsu': Red silicone looks like rust, XD
[2024-08-06T15:20:14] Smart Repair: That was also the reason why I bought glitter. It is simply more comfortable
[2024-08-06T15:21:59] GABE: is it really?
[2024-08-06T15:22:18] GABE: the cap sags on my 801d
[2024-08-06T15:23:54] cihan: I also think capacitor is better as long as it has low ESR.
[2024-08-06T15:24:23] Paolo ⁭: Everything in the word when shorts has sag😂

[2024-08-06T15:28:11] GABE: Welds turn worse a while after it turns to 5.7v
[2024-08-06T15:28:25] GABE: Which is bad
[2024-08-06T15:29:07] GABE: Having like 10 lipos to roulette would be better
[2024-08-06T15:29:15] GABE: Charge them while you weld
[2024-08-06T15:30:28] 'lekrsu': 19Ah LiPo 😁
[2024-08-06T15:30:54] 'lekrsu': One screwed up weld, removed, instantly cut myself on it. It's a sign!
[2024-08-06T15:31:04] GABE: Can be 1h charge
[2024-08-06T15:31:13] GABE: back to max volts
[2024-08-06T15:31:33] 'lekrsu': I'm welding with three 120c/240c 6.6Ah 3S LiPo's in parallel rn
[2024-08-06T15:34:09] Yamal: For deck

[2024-08-06T15:35:13] Paolo ⁭: Problem is you will go over current error with kweld
[2024-08-06T15:35:25] Paolo ⁭: Fucking stupid
[2024-08-06T15:36:05] 'lekrsu': Heard of that
[2024-08-06T15:36:14] 'lekrsu': Must be annoying
[2024-08-06T15:36:14] cihan: I will have plenty of time while welding. I can charge even between 8 welds. I'll be building a battery once in 3 years on average. I can spend 10 hours for welding a battery without a problem. I just want the welds to be good quality. Would you recommend 801D or 801H for me?
[2024-08-06T15:37:39] cihan: I think I'll get 801H. I won't be able to buy a new welder for a very long time with new taxes. I should probably buy the best I can afford.

[2024-08-06T16:58:42] puneDir: +fishpaper on plexy
[2024-08-06T16:58:42] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. puneDir has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-08-06T17:05:10] Jason: uhhhh
[2024-08-06T17:07:05] puneDir: why ?
[2024-08-06T17:07:36] Jason: aah copper wire so thin
[2024-08-06T17:07:48] puneDir: i added few more nickel to reinforce
[2024-08-06T17:08:01] puneDir: its more than enough. Theres nickel
[2024-08-06T17:41:18] sombre_enfant: I use the cells welding pen
[2024-08-06T18:21:25] Patrick: Cable from battery is pain positive side is soon done as good as possible on this battery
[2024-08-06T18:28:49] Yamal: MoliDir?
[2024-08-06T18:29:39] puneDir: shit m26
[2024-08-06T18:30:44] Yamal: It’s okay 👍
[2024-08-06T19:08:22] Patrick: Omg didnt even have to cross wires i could cry this BMS is so bigggg
[2024-08-06T19:08:47] Patrick: Only buying smaller once for this size battery now 10 mental brakedowns when laying the cables
[2024-08-06T19:09:26] Patrick: Had to isolate the outputs with silicon couldnt get any kapton on some spaces
[2024-08-06T19:10:34] Patrick: Ble couldnt lay better didnt plan it, thought it was already build in and didnt have the right tools to make a new connector
[2024-08-06T19:13:32] 'lekrsu': Indeed humongous
[2024-08-06T19:13:51] 'lekrsu': I won't be able to use my jdb
[2024-08-06T19:17:21] Patrick: Why?
[2024-08-06T19:17:30] Patrick: To big?
[2024-08-06T19:19:58] 'lekrsu': Yes & my ant is 300a & half the size.
[2024-08-06T19:29:50] GABE: What's that for
[2024-08-06T19:35:24] puneDir: there was 8
[2024-08-06T19:36:37] puneDir: Now theres 10
[2024-08-06T19:39:49] puneDir: The red things
[2024-08-06T20:10:46] Yamal: King shawarma
[2024-08-06T20:14:54] cihan: Thanks. I saw some Russian videos of 801D and 801H and decided to buy 801H. It has 20 transistors vs 5 on 801D and better transistor protection and shunt and also better welding pen. I wish I won't need to ask more advice on spot welder in future. :)
[2024-08-06T20:21:37] cihan: A comparison video of Glitter 801A, 801D and 801H. Last model in the video is a rebranded Glitter 801H. https://youtu.be/LbevSFD4dPU
[2024-08-06T20:22:20] cihan: By the way are there any Russian speakers in the group?
[2024-08-06T20:56:56] haku: what is 32e? samsung 35e?
[2024-08-06T21:06:26] Rose: Hey there D, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-08-06T21:08:11] haku: the holes on you front wheel does rocks ever get in it?
[2024-08-06T21:15:34] 'lekrsu': 600a peak afaik
[2024-08-06T21:16:34] 'lekrsu': <photos/photo_16666@06-08-2024_21-16-34.jpg>
[2024-08-06T21:16:36] Yamal: no, they act like a washing machine
[2024-08-06T21:17:22] Yamal: If you open the door, all the clothes will fly away, I think,,,
[2024-08-06T21:18:14] 'lekrsu': <photos/photo_16667@06-08-2024_21-18-14.jpg>
[2024-08-06T21:18:14] 'lekrsu': <photos/photo_16668@06-08-2024_21-18-14.jpg>
[2024-08-06T21:23:24] 'lekrsu': You're absolutely right, 300A is peak rather than continuous
[2024-08-06T21:27:27] haku: i want to try to do that to my 70h too or my laotie motor. to help with cooling
[2024-08-06T21:28:04] cihan: The new law will come into force 15 days after it was legislated. And it was legislated yesterday. New government will probably decrease this tax but cannot be sure. Somehow any kind of tax accepted by people is never removed even when governments change. In fact I was deciding to buy or not to buy a spot welder first then I was debating to buy or not to buy a docreate welder for 110 USD. Now I bought a spot welder for 320 USD because it'll probably be the only spot welder I'll ever buy as long as I reside in Turkey and wanted to buy the best I can afford and utilize. New law really helps keeping dollars inside the country. I'm sorry for this off topic message.
[2024-08-06T21:29:14] cihan: I'm not sure if the package will be delivered or refused by customs, I tried my chance. I'll also buy some copper strips and some steel strips.
[2024-08-06T21:31:04] cihan: Does copper sandwich work best with steel strips? Copper strip should be just plain strip and steel strip should be slotted, right?
[2024-08-06T21:32:35] Smart Repair: Apart from the throttle curve, can I increase the torque from 0kmh a little? I can do a wheelie at 40kmh, but not at 5kmh
[2024-08-06T21:39:30] haku: the heat here might be the a problem though.
[2024-08-06T21:39:46] haku: but winter riding is soon so no need to worry
[2024-08-06T21:49:40] Martin Kaktits: your winter is prob my summer 🥲
[2024-08-06T21:59:02] Pandalgns: You dont know how is summer in Asturias 😂😂😂
[2024-08-06T22:24:12] Yamal: Never 😂
[2024-08-06T22:24:33] Yamal: But now I can try , I’m alone 😂👌
[2024-08-06T22:25:41] Yamal: The ideal thing would be to do it in the final part of the "spin" wash.
[2024-08-06T22:27:25] Yamal: Thank goodness Benjamin is not in the group otherwise he would say: Hey, what the hell are you doing talking about washing machines? - get engine detection done!
[2024-08-06T22:29:42] Yamal: vVesc has come to stay...❤️, I know that right now he is having something cool on some bohemian terrace of some bar...
[2024-08-06T22:31:18] Yamal: Won't you make video calls with him?
[2024-08-06T22:35:20] Patrick: OMG i should have messured the BMS
[2024-08-06T22:35:26] Patrick: JBD website said 22mm
[2024-08-06T22:35:47] Patrick: But without the fucking screws on the BMS and heatsink bigger too
[2024-08-06T22:36:12] Patrick: Now i can reprint my spacer and redo the Led stripes & charging port
[2024-08-06T22:36:55] Patrick: The childs working at JBD gave messurements without the screws😭
[2024-08-06T22:36:55] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Patrick has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-08-06T22:47:54] Yamal: Nop ^^'
[2024-08-06T22:49:02] Yamal: I'm fine with him firmware that I have, my controller gives what it gives, you can't ask the elm for pears
[2024-08-06T22:49:45] crimeware: Can you spot the mistake?
[2024-08-06T22:50:14] crimeware: Besides my workspace being a floor ☺️
[2024-08-06T22:59:26] 'lekrsu': The five ST-links watching you work
[2024-08-06T23:06:11] crimeware: <photos/photo_16672@06-08-2024_23-06-11.jpg>
[2024-08-06T23:07:13] crimeware: The chiness sold me a F2 Pro crossbar and titled it G2 Crossbar... Those fuckers at AliExpress will not recover from my review...
[2024-08-06T23:14:40] Patrick: If i turn off charge and discharge the BMS isnt giving out voltage right? Jbd app is confussing me
[2024-08-06T23:15:09] Patrick: Also what in the world is niminal capacity wrong translation?
[2024-08-06T23:15:10] Rose: Hey there Илья, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-08-06T23:15:37] Patrick: Also where can i change the language?
[2024-08-06T23:16:53] Patrick: And last thing in the Function settings balancing is on but it shows off why?
[2024-08-06T23:17:01] crimeware: German is a shit language to work for chinese for translation.
[2024-08-06T23:17:17] Patrick: Shouldnt balance now but i atleast want to know why the 1 tab shows on then
[2024-08-06T23:17:30] Patrick: Where can i change it?
[2024-08-06T23:17:40] Patrick: I couldnt even select it when creating my account
[2024-08-06T23:17:44] crimeware: It takes your system language duh
[2024-08-06T23:18:38] crimeware: Current is literally translatet as "currently now"
[2024-08-06T23:19:03] Patrick: I want to change it
[2024-08-06T23:19:14] Patrick: But i dont want to change my system language
[2024-08-06T23:19:18] crimeware: Go to your phone settings, switch language to English
[2024-08-06T23:19:50] crimeware: I can give you three options
[2024-08-06T23:20:36] crimeware: 1. Deal with the shit translation 2. Offer JBD a free accurate translation for German 3. Switch to English System language & don't whine about it.
[2024-08-06T23:20:58] Patrick: Damn, now i know why the App is called shit
[2024-08-06T23:21:50] Patrick: Do you know if daly has the same problem in the App? The new BMS they offer looks decent
[2024-08-06T23:22:03] crimeware: I don't build batteries my friend
[2024-08-06T23:22:37] Patrick: Also why isnt it balancing changed it to 0.010V currently it is at 0.011V Balancing still shows off
[2024-08-06T23:22:50] Patrick: Can someone please explain the app a little bit
[2024-08-06T23:23:08] crimeware: I live in a MIETWOHNUNG so if I make 1 mistake & the cells burst we are all fucked.
[2024-08-06T23:23:50] Lisa: Download admin app
[2024-08-06T23:24:00] Patrick: HUH i change balance voltage it says succesfull but once i open it again its reset to 0.015V
[2024-08-06T23:24:05] Lisa: Daly has a good app
[2024-08-06T23:24:29] Patrick: Also whats the Softlock function?
[2024-08-06T23:24:55] crimeware: I told you, the app is translating everything in LITERAL German
[2024-08-06T23:24:57] Patrick: There isnt even a help button
[2024-08-06T23:25:14] Patrick: Yes and? Still isnt explaining why i cant change the things
[2024-08-06T23:25:37] Patrick: If it says successfull and i even see the set 0.010V why is it changing
[2024-08-06T23:25:58] Patrick: <photos/photo_16674@06-08-2024_23-25-58.jpg>
[2024-08-06T23:26:06] crimeware: Bruder entweder heißt dass, die Settings per Software so bleiben oder änder einfach die verfickte handy sprache auf Englisch amk
[2024-08-06T23:26:35] Patrick: JA DIGGA aber warum trägt die app überhaupt hier die andere voltage an
[2024-08-06T23:26:51] Patrick: Wenns falsche translation ist sollte doch garnicht erst die spannung andere dran stehen
[2024-08-06T23:26:51] crimeware: Mayhe because SOFTLOCK is activated?
[2024-08-06T23:27:21] Patrick: I got the settings to change otherstuff
[2024-08-06T23:27:38] crimeware: Just deactivate it
[2024-08-06T23:27:40] Patrick: And i am not even finding a button to turn off this softlock
[2024-08-06T23:28:02] crimeware: Change the god damn system language to Englisch
[2024-08-06T23:28:13] 'lekrsu': How's it different?
[2024-08-06T23:28:29] crimeware: <photos/photo_16675@06-08-2024_23-28-29.jpg>
[2024-08-06T23:28:29] crimeware: <photos/photo_16672@06-08-2024_23-06-11.jpg>
[2024-08-06T23:28:46] crimeware: Is a light turning on, why it's different?
[2024-08-06T23:29:01] Patrick: Bro if i swear if it shows a button only when changing the language last time i buy the jbd
[2024-08-06T23:29:56] 'lekrsu': What? I'm not following
[2024-08-06T23:30:14] 'lekrsu': Never seen either model irl that's why I'm asking
[2024-08-06T23:30:20] crimeware: <photos/photo_16677@06-08-2024_23-30-20.jpg>
[2024-08-06T23:31:14] crimeware: <photos/photo_16678@06-08-2024_23-31-14.jpg>
[2024-08-06T23:31:24] cihan: Please recommend me strip for welding with Glitter 801H. Is there any problem with copper on long term about oxide? I'll do copper sandwich if there's no oxidation problem. 0.15 copper or 0.2 copper and what strip to place on copper?
[2024-08-06T23:31:54] cihan: There are steel and different nickel alloys.
[2024-08-06T23:31:57] crimeware: Copper does not love Air
[2024-08-06T23:33:09] cihan: That's true. I always thought copper oxide keeps moving towards the inner area of copper but people claim it stays only on surface of the copper.
[2024-08-06T23:33:30] Patrick: Oh this is the voltage when balancing is active right?
[2024-08-06T23:33:48] Patrick: But why is it switching back to 0.015V then?
[2024-08-06T23:33:59] crimeware: German > English
[2024-08-06T23:34:09] 'lekrsu': Can you set it higher?
[2024-08-06T23:34:24] Patrick: Bro es macht auch auf englisch kein sinn wieso spannungsdifferenz nicht kleiner setzen kann
[2024-08-06T23:34:43] 'lekrsu': Nein
[2024-08-06T23:34:52] Patrick: Yea but why cant i go lower? Other limit that i cant adjust?
[2024-08-06T23:34:56] 'lekrsu': ahah
[2024-08-06T23:35:07] 'lekrsu': Idk, I've never turned the bms on
[2024-08-06T23:35:13] crimeware: Do you get it now?
[2024-08-06T23:35:21] 'lekrsu': it's a hole
[2024-08-06T23:35:39] 'lekrsu': I'll get a G2 someday, maybe.
[2024-08-06T23:35:48] crimeware: Alright I will explain it since pictures seem not to work
[2024-08-06T23:37:07] 'lekrsu': You just circled holes lol
[2024-08-06T23:37:45] 'lekrsu': The mount side needs a hole for the lodge hmm
[2024-08-06T23:38:13] crimeware: The G2 & G30 have 2 holes in the crossbar / steering bar one for the cables in the dash and then the front nose so the lash is secured and doesn't slip off. The F2 Series just doesn't use it so it's just 1 hole for the cables
[2024-08-06T23:38:47] crimeware: <photos/photo_16679@06-08-2024_23-38-47.jpg>
[2024-08-06T23:39:54] 'lekrsu': Strange thing to switch design with
[2024-08-06T23:40:07] crimeware: This is only on the F2 Series
[2024-08-06T23:40:42] crimeware: And the sellers on AliExpress think it all works the same... Well it does not
[2024-08-06T23:40:48] 'lekrsu': G2 width looks nice, wonder if it's the same width I'm using
[2024-08-06T23:41:03] crimeware: 50.5cm
[2024-08-06T23:41:07] 'lekrsu': G30 is so short & I installed that on a 1S that my brother uses
[2024-08-06T23:41:11] crimeware: G2 fits in G30
[2024-08-06T23:41:16] 'lekrsu': Since 1S was even shorter haha
[2024-08-06T23:41:27] crimeware: Monorim sells wider
[2024-08-06T23:42:06] crimeware: That's good, so they can't blame JBD for doing retarded stuff
[2024-08-06T23:42:08] 'lekrsu': Mines 60cm apparently
[2024-08-06T23:42:37] crimeware: Well I ordered now the correct one and have to wait another shitty week
[2024-08-06T23:42:46] 'lekrsu': Only a week? 👀
[2024-08-06T23:43:11] 'lekrsu': Takes a month here usually
[2024-08-06T23:43:31] crimeware: First one got broken during shipping, this is the second order and now it turns out it was false now another week
[2024-08-06T23:43:54] crimeware: Do you want me to be your drop shipper?
[2024-08-06T23:44:00] 'lekrsu': Meanwhile lcsc is a week sometimes
[2024-08-06T23:44:20] crimeware: Ali even has 3 day shipping for germans
[2024-08-06T23:44:23] 'lekrsu': Shipping free if one waits though
[2024-08-06T23:44:27] 'lekrsu': tf
[2024-08-06T23:44:43] crimeware: I tried it out, it really was 3 days
[2024-08-06T23:45:01] crimeware: Fuck DHL
[2024-08-06T23:45:06] 'lekrsu': dhl is awesome
[2024-08-06T23:45:12] crimeware: Not here
[2024-08-06T23:45:21] 'lekrsu': ups sucks the most
[2024-08-06T23:45:48] 'lekrsu': last time I had to explain to them that the handlebars does NOT fit in my apartment mailbox
[2024-08-06T23:46:06] 'lekrsu': Bounced back to the airport for a week until I interrupted their loop
[2024-08-06T23:54:53] crimeware: ☺️ dhl in Germany
[2024-08-06T23:58:24] Илья: Hello everyone✋. I want to connect the tle5012b encoder using an ssh wh connection, what is the nss connector, it is not on the vesc, where should I connect the CS from the encoder?
[2024-08-07T01:07:35] cihan: How can I make slots on copper sheet and nickel sheet myself if I just buy sheet rather than strips?
[2024-08-07T01:13:33] cihan: Will it be fine to solder without slots? I liked the idea of sheet metal rather than strips. Should I use sheet copper and sheet nickel or sheet copper and just nickel strip? Nickel sheet on top will probably add little more conductivity but cost a lot. What if I use stainless steel strip rather than nickel plated strip on top?
[2024-08-07T01:20:25] cihan: Is there any type of steel working best or should I just weld any steel strip sold on AliExpress without nickel?
[2024-08-07T01:23:00] cihan: Ahh nickel plated steel, ok. İ thought I'd use pure steel without nickel. Thanks I would like to try 0.2mm copper. 801D welds 0.15mm copper and 0.15mm plated nickel so maybe I can increase copper thickness to 0.2mm. Should I?
[2024-08-07T01:24:59] crimeware: You should read a book about electricity & its conductivity with different type of metal.
[2024-08-07T01:29:44] cihan: I think tip pressure changes conductivity a lot in practice. I'm not sure if things on paper will work in practice since I won't be using constant pressure with spring loaded tips. So I wonder practice of people.
[2024-08-07T01:31:14] cihan: Tip surface areas also differ
[2024-08-07T01:31:23] crimeware: All of them have a different use case & Nickel is easier to work with especially if you have never worked with it before
[2024-08-07T01:32:17] crimeware: The best of best would be to use gold but suddenly your battery would cost a fortune
[2024-08-07T01:33:05] crimeware: Nationalsocialism
[2024-08-07T01:35:00] cihan: Pure nickel is even fine for the currents I'll draw for me however a battery lasts at least 4 years for me. So generating less heat is always preferable.
[2024-08-07T01:35:50] crimeware: Water cooling 🙂
[2024-08-07T01:37:51] cihan: Not water cooling but kind of cooling they use on mobile phones would work very well if it was applicable.
[2024-08-07T01:38:38] crimeware: Chief, they use graphite sheet or very thin copper pipes with 1 drop of water (which is called water cooling)
[2024-08-07T01:40:50] crimeware: A lot of manufacturers use Graphitesheet, some use a copper chamber with a droplet of water that evaporates and turns back into liquid once it cooled down. And yes, that water inside won't hold for long since it will one day evaporate to extinction.
[2024-08-07T01:44:06] crimeware: Both applications suck ass if you ask me. Graphite hasn't really been researched enough, a thin copper pipe with a single drop of water doesn't cut it since the heat isn't really cooled down besides you... STOP. DOING. WHAT. YOU. ARE. DOING
[2024-08-07T01:44:18] crimeware: <animation>
[2024-08-07T01:44:30] crimeware: Which silver, there are many types of silver 🙂
[2024-08-07T01:45:27] crimeware: I am not a battery expert but I know my shit around phones & heat issues
[2024-08-07T01:46:25] cihan: Possible but there are better cooling liquids for closed chamber cooling. Liquids with low specific weight and more heat conductivity should be better. Somehow manufacturer should make the deck that way.
[2024-08-07T01:46:46] crimeware: Here is a reason why not:
[2024-08-07T01:46:55] crimeware: <animation>
[2024-08-07T01:47:27] crimeware: I will weld my fork on a battery mashallah 😒
[2024-08-07T01:48:14] cihan: How did you learn mashallah?)
[2024-08-07T01:48:39] crimeware: Berlin has became Istanbul
[2024-08-07T01:49:05] crimeware: Every second word is: 1. Mashallah 2. Habibi 3. Wallah
[2024-08-07T01:50:42] cihan: Many Turks migrated Germany lately. But those words are actually mostly used by Arabs. Somehow Europeans consider people from mostly Muslims nations similar.
[2024-08-07T01:51:21] crimeware: You'd be surprised how many turks speak the way arabic people do...
[2024-08-07T01:51:32] crimeware: My favorite is jahudi
[2024-08-07T01:52:59] cihan: Strange, Turkish has many words from Arabic but it's easy to understand the speaker's native language from pronunciation.
[2024-08-07T01:54:29] cihan: By the way habibi is never used in Turkish. Anyone pronouncing habibi is native Arabic speaker.
[2024-08-07T01:54:31] crimeware: Berlin has a lot of diversity, you are getting over whelmed by it but I like it. So many great food has come to Germany which people are missing out... Can't live without turkish sarma
[2024-08-07T01:55:57] cihan: Sarma made with grapevine leaves?
[2024-08-07T01:56:10] crimeware: What else?
[2024-08-07T01:57:01] cihan: That's the most common one but there are also some different plant leaves used in northern Turkey and eastern Turkey. Yes, it's delicious.)
[2024-08-07T01:57:41] crimeware: My mother makes Sarma with meat & she offered my sisters turkish friends to try it out ofc without pork
[2024-08-07T01:58:14] crimeware: It's made with lettuce leaves rice & grinded meat
[2024-08-07T01:59:06] crimeware: <photos/photo_16681@07-08-2024_01-59-06.jpg>
[2024-08-07T01:59:07] cihan: Lettuce? Isn't it parsley?
[2024-08-07T01:59:57] cihan: Ahh it's cabbage roll, not grapevine roll
[2024-08-07T02:00:51] cihan: This is grapevine roll.
[2024-08-07T02:00:52] crimeware: It's different with meat but my mother is always experimenting around with my rice
[2024-08-07T02:01:12] crimeware: 😘 i love turkish sarma
[2024-08-07T02:02:45] cihan: You can use meat and cook with butter. Or you can use rice and cook with olive oil. They're both good. Cabbage roll is more suitable for cooking with butter. You can cook grapevine roll with meat inside with butter or with rice inside and with olive oil.
[2024-08-07T02:05:03] cihan: Cabbage is more suitable for meat inside and with butter. But some people also cook with rice inside and with olive oil too. It mostly depends on region. In regions where olive grows most, they cook everything with olive oil like southern and western Turkey. Inland areas where weather is colder in winter mostly use butter.
[2024-08-07T02:05:38] cihan: Olive doesn't grow at inland areas so historically olive oil meals are less common.
[2024-08-07T02:05:55] crimeware: 😨 this is like india
[2024-08-07T02:06:57] cihan: I've got no idea about their cuisine. But climate should differ a lot in such a big country so the cuisine too.
[2024-08-07T02:07:53] crimeware: India is the same where ever you are, it's prepared differently
[2024-08-07T02:08:08] cihan: This website in general has good recipes. Your mother can benefit from it with translation. https://www.nefisyemektarifleri.com/
[2024-08-07T02:08:19] crimeware: Saved
[2024-08-07T02:09:01] crimeware: I gave my father last week sucuk, he never knew what that was... Now he craves it... Hahaha
[2024-08-07T02:09:55] cihan: They also have a Youtube channel https://youtube.com/@nefisyemektarifleri?si=IWWFe_zJJAzo9SpV
[2024-08-07T02:11:31] cihan: Nice to know. Let your father try pastırma, maybe he likes it too. But it smells a lot because of an ingredient used for covering the meat. And you keep smelling after eating too for some days.)
[2024-08-07T02:16:43] crimeware: Sounds interesting
[2024-08-07T02:17:24] cihan: <photos/photo_16683@07-08-2024_02-17-24.jpg>
[2024-08-07T02:17:31] cihan: This is pastırma.
[2024-08-07T02:19:54] crimeware: <photos/photo_16684@07-08-2024_02-19-54.jpg>
[2024-08-07T02:20:06] crimeware: I am getting hungry 😭
[2024-08-07T02:20:09] cihan: Also delicious)
[2024-08-07T03:07:12] haku: are these halls in the right order i did the same for the phases. would it matter when using vesc?
[2024-08-07T03:07:42] haku: that looks good
[2024-08-07T03:26:18] haku: my boy about to have a poor mans surron.
[2024-08-07T03:43:35] Patrick: This JBD i have ruined the battery
[2024-08-07T03:43:45] Patrick: Has anyone ever tryed removing the heatsink?
[2024-08-07T03:43:57] Patrick: Or maybe switching it to a thin alu plate maybe 2mm
[2024-08-07T03:44:31] Patrick: This one
[2024-08-07T03:45:46] Patrick: Bought 100A and got 150A, also 27mm in total instead of the 22mm the website said. What i want to do is maybe open the wrap tomorrow, removing the heatsink and grinding away the fins shouldnt be that big of a problem right?
[2024-08-07T03:45:46] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Patrick has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-08-07T04:05:18] haku: why not print a spacer. alot of stl available i think
[2024-08-07T04:09:36] Patrick: I made my own spacer new one isnt a problem but its just a pain
[2024-08-07T04:09:57] Patrick: On my current i got led stripes and stuff build in its sad ripping it apart
[2024-08-07T04:10:40] haku: dam that sucks. aslong as all the important stuff fits i guess
[2024-08-07T04:11:03] Patrick: I think about swapping the BMS right now but then i would need to reweld the outputs a third time, do all balancers new and currently 70€ is a lot of money
[2024-08-07T04:21:12] haku: how can i use these forks on this bike.
[2024-08-07T04:30:35] FreehandZ: I think its probably not long enough unless you mod the bike frame

[2024-08-07T04:35:32] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: And you have another system
[2024-08-07T04:35:39] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Pipe with thread
[2024-08-07T04:35:42] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Not compatible
[2024-08-07T04:35:42] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Arsenus has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-08-07T04:41:40] haku: gotcha. thanks fellas.
[2024-08-07T04:41:53] haku: i wish i can weld
[2024-08-07T04:43:36] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Meh
[2024-08-07T04:43:46] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Just buy some shit fork
[2024-08-07T04:48:34] haku: i want to use g30 front wheel with the bike
[2024-08-07T04:50:29] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: I think you need just adjust front v-brakes :D
[2024-08-07T05:33:47] Noname: Doesn't fit in the bike forks?
[2024-08-07T05:45:36] haku: it might but the drum brakes need an adapter
[2024-08-07T05:46:31] Noname: You raising a sissy? Toss em
[2024-08-07T06:03:44] haku: also different size tires. its like having 1 big nut and a small nut

[2024-08-07T11:24:30] Yamal: but you won't have too much autonomy...?
[2024-08-07T11:26:29] puneDir: What is autonomy
[2024-08-07T11:26:59] Yamal: Big battery
[2024-08-07T11:27:05] Yamal: haku! nightmares about Aladin again?
[2024-08-07T11:27:17] Yamal: :p
[2024-08-07T11:28:01] haku: not aladin. its the blue guy i have nightmares
[2024-08-07T11:29:40] haku: arab men are real men. i dont think they tolerate wokeness there

[2024-08-07T17:18:38] crimeware: ?
[2024-08-07T17:23:46] Yamal: Just still thinking about the logo …. :( Benjamin Vedder number 1 performance?
[2024-08-07T17:24:27] crimeware: Ahhh YESC Yamal ESC 😄
[2024-08-07T17:24:31] Yamal: Best vesc Vedder.. don’t know really
[2024-08-07T17:24:40] Yamal: My name for what
[2024-08-07T17:27:58] Yamal: There is only one protagonist here, and his name is Benjamin and his last name is Vedder, and there is only one project, Vesc, so the logo has to revolve around this...
[2024-08-07T17:40:48] puneDir: Yes
[2024-08-07T17:40:56] puneDir: <photos/photo_16700@07-08-2024_17-40-56.jpg>

[2024-08-07T17:48:24] Yamal: What top speed do you think it will reach?
[2024-08-07T17:49:18] puneDir: 3x xt60 on both Its trusty and i had a lotta xt60s on hand
[2024-08-07T17:49:27] puneDir: 70-80 is enough I want insane torque instead of speed
[2024-08-07T17:53:40] Yamal: With that wheel diameter I'm sure you'll get it, I think, how many A's per controller does it have at most?
[2024-08-07T17:56:34] Yamal: You have to open a crowdfunding in the group, and have each person put in €1 so with 400 euros you get a vesc controller, do it with the hashtag "save puneRun"
[2024-08-07T17:57:02] cihan: Do you have a proper battery making video showing where to be careful and pay attention?
[2024-08-07T18:00:48] Yamal: To acquire str500 we would each have to put in €2.5... it's nothing
[2024-08-07T18:02:31] Yamal: Or do you imagine that this becomes rotating and we finish all of them? group with Trampa /x12/7 XD
[2024-08-07T18:04:00] Yamal: too many fears! complex! doubts! ^^'
[2024-08-07T18:28:45] puneDir: 150a planned

[2024-08-07T19:30:30] Paolo ⁭: Yes, unfortunately
[2024-08-07T19:32:40] Yamal: you are a box of surprises
[2024-08-07T19:33:35] Yamal: What do you prefer Asian or European food?
[2024-08-07T19:40:22] Paolo ⁭: There's huge difference, I eat both in my everyday diet
[2024-08-07T19:41:11] Paolo ⁭: But to cook, Italian for sure
[2024-08-07T19:41:12] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Do u eat coscus
[2024-08-07T19:41:28] Yamal: 😂
[2024-08-07T19:41:45] Paolo ⁭: Too much smoke in asian oil, specially with spicy food
[2024-08-07T19:41:53] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's middle eastern no ?
[2024-08-07T19:42:01] Paolo ⁭: @punedir u think ahha
[2024-08-07T19:43:18] Yamal: Beef rendang ;)
[2024-08-07T19:47:07] Yamal: the Chinese food is not particularly spicy,,, In Asia, spicy food goes to Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.
[2024-08-07T19:58:21] puneDir: what is coscus?
[2024-08-07T20:02:24] Yamal: <photos/photo_16701@07-08-2024_20-02-24.jpg>

[2024-08-07T21:13:12] Paolo ⁭: No you wrong
[2024-08-07T21:13:36] Paolo ⁭: China is a spicy country, they put spicy in everything
[2024-08-07T21:13:49] crimeware: ✔️ CORRECT
[2024-08-07T21:14:43] haku: they also have that chili oil in the table to make it more spicy
[2024-08-07T21:14:45] crimeware: The koreans make the best noodles
[2024-08-07T21:15:02] haku: china makes it best imo
[2024-08-07T21:15:15] crimeware: I love my jajang
[2024-08-07T21:15:38] haku: fresh pulled noodles
[2024-08-07T21:15:58] crimeware: Have you ever tried Jajang?
[2024-08-07T21:16:09] haku: italy #1 china #2 when it comes to noodles
[2024-08-07T21:16:44] haku: no
[2024-08-07T21:16:44] crimeware: China invented ice ☺️ the italians improved it
[2024-08-07T21:17:17] haku: maybe ice cream. gelato
[2024-08-07T21:17:31] crimeware: If you love dark soy, try jajang it's dark bean paste with thick noodles and veggies
[2024-08-07T21:17:58] haku: i like chinese dimsum breakfast
[2024-08-07T21:18:23] haku: but nothing beats american steak and eggs
[2024-08-07T21:18:25] crimeware: Stop making me hungry
[2024-08-07T21:19:15] crimeware: May I introduce everyone to Cevapcici & Ayvar with Kaymak?
[2024-08-07T21:19:47] haku: ive heard about those. very cool
[2024-08-07T21:20:02] crimeware: You need to try them, you will get addicted
[2024-08-07T21:20:25] crimeware: Even my vegetarian female friend comits sins when she sees me with it
[2024-08-07T21:22:16] crimeware: I swear bread is an underrated topic when its about food
[2024-08-07T21:34:53] cihan: I used to buy these brackets to hold the cells. But they seem to be too high compared to cell height and make welding harder. Should I file or cut the top part of the cell holder? I couldn't save photo from aliexpress, somehow I cannot give aliexpress file access authorization. https://a.aliexpress.com/_Ewj70FX

[2024-08-07T23:12:30] haku: yea i got mine from that vendor. better than amazon one tbh
[2024-08-07T23:17:44] cihan: Thanks a lot. 8 AWG seems suitable for my need. Battery power will never exceed 2kW. Phase cables are also 8AWG and controller cable is also 8AWG. Is there any benefit in getting 6 AWG?
[2024-08-07T23:40:25] GABE: Who said 801D welds 0.15 copper
[2024-08-07T23:40:45] GABE: It can't. 0.1 only, lol
[2024-08-08T00:34:18] cihan: @lBabacar told. By the way I bought 801H. I'm not sure if I'll be able to receive it though. I also bought 0.2mm copper. I feel like it'll be able to weld 0.2
[2024-08-08T00:38:48] cihan: Customs will be really busy in next 2 weeks. They'll either let many things pass or delay all deliveries and check all, I'm not sure what will happen. I'll claim a refund to bank if I cannot get it. I already paid the tax in advance. If the postman comes to the apartment and asks for extra tax I'll probably take the package from him and won't pay extra tax and tell him to make a criminal complaint because the recipient stole the package from him and didn't pay tax. I'm serious about this.
[2024-08-08T01:10:43] Rose: Hey there D, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-08-08T01:22:08] haku: always use paypal to pay for stuff
[2024-08-08T02:10:52] Paolo ⁭: You didn't paid any tax on AliExpress
[2024-08-08T02:11:13] Paolo ⁭: Over 150$ tax is paid on delivery
[2024-08-08T02:11:56] cihan: PayPal left Turkey in 2016. Turkish government asked PayPal to pay tax since they earn in Turkey. They didn't accept paying tax and left and all accounts in Turkey were closed some years later.
[2024-08-08T03:26:34] haku: holy crap china military using electric skateboards. wonder if its vesc or kelly?
[2024-08-08T03:26:38] haku: https://youtube.com/shorts/pafFnFfIcWY?si=3wAmhkXkk1xg-ckf
[2024-08-08T03:27:57] haku: ngl thats pretty cool but ill just shoot the battery so they can burst in flames
[2024-08-08T03:54:37] cihan: No, I paid it. I bought it from Banggood. Banggood ships items worth more than 150 USD including the tax. But I'm not sure if it'll be rejected by customs. I tried my chance.
[2024-08-08T04:53:59] cihan: Does this one work fine as a thermal glue ? https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006181447989.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.1.71ba26360b6xE3&algo_pvid=05e27ca7-4225-417f-a635-56605e62ca8d&algo_exp_id=05e27ca7-4225-417f-a635-56605e62ca8d-0&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%215.56%214.45%21%21%2139.68%2131.74%21%402103251317230855202372531e8f4f%2112000036165511647%21sea%21TR%21195302801%21X&curPageLogUid=Ji8JilwktfKF&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A
[2024-08-08T04:54:30] cihan: I also need recommendation for thermal pad too but I can buy it from Turkey if they are almost the same and not really effective.
[2024-08-08T05:18:43] cihan: He uses some kind of rubber roll here but I am not sure about the material he is using. Is any kind of such rubber sheet fine or is there a better type for wrapping the battery ? https://youtu.be/3dD5KmM8ciU?t=751
[2024-08-08T06:10:45] haku: fishpaper and insulation tape should do the same thing i think.
[2024-08-08T07:54:38] Yamal: Tomorrow new firmware ?

[2024-08-08T11:18:58] Yamal: I really don’t know about the trail,, What do you think ..? Material… components ,,, :( but no look really cool or good,,
[2024-08-08T11:20:28] haku: thats 11" tire?
[2024-08-08T11:20:43] Yamal: I think
[2024-08-08T11:21:02] haku: gay
[2024-08-08T11:21:43] Yamal: Maybe they try look William wallace f1 but 👎
[2024-08-08T11:22:15] haku: they took my idea of a laotie with wallace covers
[2024-08-08T11:23:13] Yamal: scottish spirit in laotie?!
[2024-08-08T11:24:50] haku: imo a scooter that huge in 11" tires is a fail
[2024-08-08T11:25:43] Yamal: On the other hand, a g30 with 11" is a goal?
[2024-08-08T11:26:00] haku: small frame big tires yes
[2024-08-08T11:29:39] 'lekrsu': Those welds don't look good ahh
[2024-08-08T11:30:38] Paolo ⁭: Ask to @Foujiwara
[2024-08-08T11:53:06] cihan: Sparks are a sign of current traveling on the surface?
[2024-08-08T11:54:26] 'lekrsu': Discoloring on the vid. Too long burst and likely steel instead of nickel.
[2024-08-08T11:54:27] cihan: By the way I still don't know how I'll be welding with the battery brackets and copper sheet bus. I think I'll have to use hot melt silicone.
[2024-08-08T11:55:21] cihan: . Maybe he used more than enough current?
[2024-08-08T11:56:22] 'lekrsu': Oh wait, he talked about it in the vid XD
[2024-08-08T11:56:26] 'lekrsu': https://youtu.be/3dD5KmM8ciU?t=196
[2024-08-08T11:57:35] 'lekrsu': He knows it's not a good setup at least, so that's nice of him to mention
[2024-08-08T12:04:09] cihan: I just listened. Is custom made cell holder a must with bus connection?
[2024-08-08T12:04:53] 'lekrsu': What's a bus connection?
[2024-08-08T12:05:04] 'lekrsu': I don't understand the question
[2024-08-08T12:17:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I don't know why ginger on wheels think it's a beautiful scooter it's very ugly

[2024-08-08T12:19:13] cihan: I could have used the wrong word. I wanted to mean covering all the connected cells rather than using strips.
[2024-08-08T12:20:08] 'lekrsu': Covering is of course better haha
[2024-08-08T12:54:53] cihan: I only don't know how I'll hold them together.)
[2024-08-08T13:24:19] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's good but it's not game changer, it's not perform very better than basic HY at the end
[2024-08-08T13:25:07] Paolo ⁭: And the spintend stock fet compared to these two?
[2024-08-08T13:25:22] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: that's shit
[2024-08-08T13:25:35] Paolo ⁭: Stock fet you mean?
[2024-08-08T13:25:43] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes
[2024-08-08T13:25:55] Paolo ⁭: So we both agree on same thing
[2024-08-08T13:26:00] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: even worst for the new light model
[2024-08-08T13:26:07] Paolo ⁭: I don't know why @jamessoderstrom love it so much
[2024-08-08T13:26:29] Paolo ⁭: New light model is with 2mR fet, it sucks
[2024-08-08T13:26:32] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: love what? the babibel magic fet? 😂
[2024-08-08T13:26:40] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes

[2024-08-08T13:27:16] cihan: https://youtu.be/EPTJg61_5mQ?si=zdh5v0HJLNhnYpx8&t=12m6s Isn't the way he connects positive terminal dangerous? It's very very close to the side of the cell.
[2024-08-08T13:27:26] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: oh yeah, it's very good, I have maybe more than 100 of them removed on the box very good 😅
[2024-08-08T13:27:51] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: so yeah it you don't put them to the limit it's good

[2024-08-08T15:52:44] puneDir: If you cant Glue paralels with hot glue Put fishpaper on side Glue the other paralels to fishpaper
[2024-08-08T16:19:25] Patrick: Fixed it i turned on this lever in the settings
[2024-08-08T16:19:34] Patrick: Somehow it messed up the button

[2024-08-08T16:28:49] cihan: Ahh yes, I didn't notice it. It seems something useful. What is it like ? Some kind of transparent heat shrink ? I would also like to use a similar insulator.
[2024-08-08T16:30:29] cihan: I got a similar holder but it is in honeycomb form. The ones I have extend too much over the cell height. Is there a link for the holder you showed on the photo ?
[2024-08-08T16:32:55] cihan: Do you separate the parallel groups with 5fishpaper ? In fact that would be great if I could find some proper battery making videos and watch them . There are many but somehow I don't think there was one made perfectly showing all the necessary details and showing what to pay attention while making the battery.
[2024-08-08T16:34:11] cihan: In fact I like the idea of gluing the cells together since I have limited space and gluing them together could let me add one more parallel cell and that will be great.
[2024-08-08T16:35:23] 'lekrsu': Yeah

[2024-08-08T16:36:37] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: This only exists in Spain, specifically Andalusia ☺️
[2024-08-08T16:37:58] Yamal: It is a mainly tomato drink that is usually drunk in summer.
[2024-08-08T16:38:07] cihan: Some kind of vegetables saved in olive oil ?
[2024-08-08T16:38:09] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: A drink made with tomato, bread, peppers... it is made specifically in summer.
[2024-08-08T16:38:15] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes
[2024-08-08T16:38:30] cihan: Could be tasty, I read extra virgin olive oil on it.
[2024-08-08T16:39:11] cihan: What is it ? How can I search for it ? Is this some kind of heat shrink ?
[2024-08-08T16:39:21] cihan: I'm sure it is something tasty but it also looks like something to mix with alcohol.
[2024-08-08T16:39:22] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: if it also has olive oil 🫒
[2024-08-08T16:39:35] 'lekrsu': e.g. 18650 heatshrink, if you have 18650 cells
[2024-08-08T16:40:07] 'lekrsu': you drink it as is? Oo
[2024-08-08T16:40:20] cihan: Thanks a lot . I am going to search for it. I need to be quick to get all I need before taxes are increased.
[2024-08-08T16:40:47] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: No, it does not contain alcohol.
[2024-08-08T16:40:53] Yamal: yes advisable to drink it with ice hehe

[2024-08-08T17:02:46] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I had to see an order with a bullet ☺️
[2024-08-08T17:03:20] haku: remember i had to get bigger 10mm bullet because spintend changed to dual 10awg phases
[2024-08-08T17:03:24] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I asked him for all the long cables…
[2024-08-08T17:05:39] Paolo ⁭: Isn't that frame bad?
[2024-08-08T17:06:37] haku: i got mine from ali
[2024-08-08T17:09:03] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Mine fron alibaba
[2024-08-08T17:10:20] 'lekrsu': Spending 10k on a 1000km range scooter is more reasonable than 50k on a car
[2024-08-08T17:10:31] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2024-08-08T17:10:48] haku: having both is also good.
[2024-08-08T17:10:53] cihan: Can someone show me how battery terminals are connected to the strips or sheets? I saw some videos but none of them looked firm enough to me.
[2024-08-08T17:11:08] 'lekrsu': Solder?
[2024-08-08T17:11:32] haku: cant take kid and dog to school.on a scooter
[2024-08-08T17:11:48] 'lekrsu': But if you've got neither
[2024-08-08T17:12:01] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2024-08-08T17:12:50] 'lekrsu': Uh time to spot-weld
[2024-08-08T17:12:56] haku: if i did not have a kid i would 100% mostly ride pevs everywhere. probably a emoto or surron
[2024-08-08T17:12:59] cihan: Yes, I'll solder but I want connection area as large as possible. I liked the one on this ebike battery video but it doesn't look firm enough to me or is it? https://youtu.be/EPTJg61_5mQ?si=zdh5v0HJLNhnYpx8&t=12m6s
[2024-08-08T17:13:35] haku: and a g30
[2024-08-08T17:13:39] sombre_enfant: Oh i get it must be easy to replace then
[2024-08-08T17:14:38] 'lekrsu': Yes, solder a stripped wire across the whole last group
[2024-08-08T17:15:08] 'lekrsu': Might be hard on copper, never tried
[2024-08-08T17:15:22] haku: i think that guy used really thin copper. like crafting copper
[2024-08-08T17:16:36] cihan: Solder will hold copper very very good and firm. However I don't like this design since that thick cable could stress the copper on the cells a lot. Can spot weld joints withstand that stress?
[2024-08-08T17:17:29] 'lekrsu': Why'd there be stress?
[2024-08-08T17:18:20] cihan: He used 0.1mm as I remember. I'm also pretty much confused about using copper. Some say 0.2 copper is hard to weld. There's a copper topic here and there are people welding 0.5 copper with spot welder. https://endless-sphere.com/sphere/threads/copper-nickel-sandwich-buses-for-series-connections.108006/
[2024-08-08T17:19:48] cihan: That 8-10 AWG cable will be tucked inside the deck and somehow will be touching the deck and will stress copper spot weld joints, am I wrong?
[2024-08-08T17:19:51] Paolo ⁭: This is not really needed, but if you like it's ok
[2024-08-08T17:20:53] 'lekrsu': You can do higher stranded cable for more flex
[2024-08-08T17:21:04] haku: i used .2 its not hard with glitter 811h or a good kweld setup i think
[2024-08-08T17:21:15] cihan: I also saw videos just soldering the terminal wire to one side of the nickel or copper too. But that area seems too small to me. All of current will pass on like 1 cm^2.
[2024-08-08T17:21:52] cihan: I also thought so and ordered 0.2mm copper. I still don't know how people got good spot welds with 0.5mm copper or thicker.
[2024-08-08T17:22:29] Paolo ⁭: You can just weld in the center of the strip, large copper strip like this is enough
[2024-08-08T17:23:05] haku: ive never heard that. you need solder paste for that. i think 811h can do .3
[2024-08-08T17:23:08] cihan: By the way the one I bought is not 811H, 801H. But it has a thick pen cable
[2024-08-08T17:23:40] haku: good cause 811h sucks
[2024-08-08T17:24:59] cihan: 811H was certainly out of my budget. I thought between 801D and 801H and decided 801H after seeing some reviews. However it's especially new tax law which forced me to get best I could.
[2024-08-08T17:25:21] cihan: And yes, your comments helped me a lot, thanks.)
[2024-08-08T17:25:41] haku: what cells are you using? why need .2?
[2024-08-08T17:25:41] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <photos/photo_16712@08-08-2024_17-25-41.jpg>
[2024-08-08T17:25:57] haku: nice. ty
[2024-08-08T17:27:20] GABE: And now its paying off.
[2024-08-08T17:27:56] GABE: Now only 2 more exams to worry about. Electrical i just did an entire exam paper without issues and got 100 on it. lol
[2024-08-08T17:29:21] GABE: they shouldve really chosen a better name than *complex* numbers, for us adhd people.
[2024-08-08T17:33:20] 'lekrsu': Only 240 welds left now
[2024-08-08T17:35:10] sombre_enfant: The hardest part is to connect the bms b- and output b+ been months im stuck at that step
[2024-08-08T17:43:12] cihan: 18650, i also don't need hight current, I have single motor. But I just wanted to have less heat generated if possible although it's negligible. I need at most 50 A battery current, not more than that. Battery could be 20S6P or 19S5P. I don't really know which one I can fit inside the deck. I'm obliged to 18650 because of deck height.
[2024-08-08T17:44:07] haku: you should be okay with nickel
[2024-08-08T17:58:40] haku: https://youtube.com/shorts/gQDkIypr3HQ?si=YP-3fTFRZizaQKNe
[2024-08-08T17:59:09] cihan: Probably. 0.2 nickel would be more than enough. However people say they didn't have any oxidation problem with copper.
[2024-08-08T18:03:38] cihan: 8mm or 10mm nickel strip more suitable for 18650?
[2024-08-08T18:20:33] 'lekrsu': Lol why
[2024-08-08T18:20:39] 'lekrsu': Just do it
[2024-08-08T18:21:22] 'lekrsu': 8mm is nice for the positive side

[2024-08-08T21:31:49] 'lekrsu': <photos/photo_16719@08-08-2024_21-31-49.jpg>
[2024-08-08T21:36:00] cihan: Why don't we solder parallel nickel strips over series nickel strips? Wouldn't this lower resistance between series connected cells?
[2024-08-08T21:37:45] 'lekrsu': These cells are only rated for 39A continuous so it won't matter.
[2024-08-08T21:51:37] haku: what cells?
[2024-08-08T21:51:48] 'lekrsu': 32e!
[2024-08-08T22:00:45] cihan: Isn't 39A already very high current? I got confused. 8mm wide 0.3mm nickel is rated at 9.4A according to the table shared.
[2024-08-08T22:01:17] 'lekrsu': 8mm 0.15 here
[2024-08-08T22:01:32] 'lekrsu': but there's 6 plates crossing
[2024-08-08T22:02:10] GABE: Explain
[2024-08-08T22:02:28] GABE: do you mean welding on uncut strips onto copper?
[2024-08-08T22:02:37] GABE: some people like me do that, it's called laziness.

[2024-08-08T22:03:55] GABE: Half the time they beat my ass, NGL.
[2024-08-08T22:05:12] cihan: Isn't one cell rated 39A continuous? There's one strip for each cell. I'm still confused.
[2024-08-08T22:06:02] 'lekrsu': No, all 6 are in total.
[2024-08-08T22:06:32] 'lekrsu': 6.5A per cell by datasheet if I remember correctly
[2024-08-08T22:06:36] haku: are you still doing the 70h g30? or you getting a different frame?
[2024-08-08T22:07:22] cihan: I mean spot welding for a battery only utilizing nickel strips. Almost all people spot weld nickel on parallel cells first and then they spot weld nickel strip between series cells. Shouldn't it decrease resistance between series connected cells if we spot weld series cells first and then parallel cells?
[2024-08-08T22:07:37] cihan: Ahh OK, I understood.
[2024-08-08T22:15:37] crimeware: The problem is, you bought makerbase...
[2024-08-08T22:16:47] Илья: Ahaha, it can't be
[2024-08-08T22:17:24] crimeware: Is this even VESC? Looks like a module for me
[2024-08-08T22:17:48] GABE: I have the frame, and I might get another.
[2024-08-08T22:18:24] GABE: I am still doing the g30 yes, it'll be doe soon, but no escs or tyres on it.
[2024-08-08T22:18:27] Илья: This is an encoder, it allows you to track the position of the rotor, connects directly to the VESC
[2024-08-08T22:18:31] GABE: That bastard took all my shit

[2024-08-08T22:20:12] haku: would be cool to see it on g30. ive only seen french do it. but after seeing that blue guy france disapointed me
[2024-08-08T22:20:26] haku: wow
[2024-08-08T22:21:22] haku: dam. horrible stuff.
[2024-08-08T22:21:40] 'lekrsu': Easier to work on it when the last welds have potential for shorts, and not the entire time building.
[2024-08-08T22:22:03] 'lekrsu': Only the last layers that increase voltage are dangerous
[2024-08-08T22:23:11] Yamal: that has stolen from you?

[2024-08-08T22:39:42] puneDir: How
[2024-08-08T22:40:18] GABE: Mailed them to him so he can put it into both of the scooters he had, as his flipsky and xescs died, and he had no money for fets.
[2024-08-08T22:40:32] GABE: He said I can use one of his scooters for transport when I'm there.
[2024-08-08T22:41:04] GABE: I offered James to Mail them directly there, as if James mailed them to me, there would be a chance they would come during my flight, and that would be a no-go.
[2024-08-08T22:41:17] Yamal: take your tunnig e-bike and take the route to paraway
[2024-08-08T22:41:46] haku: naw. i only ride in the land of the free.
[2024-08-08T22:43:52] GABE: IT is unfortunate that my only 80100, a week before my flight, got killed due to me not securing the logic board If this didn't happen, id fly with one, and probably lose one.
[2024-08-08T22:44:22] GABE: I opted to order two, as it would save postage costs. And I figured, when why not just mail them there, save a few bucks, and then come back home with two Better to just order two to my trusted friend, instead of one here, and one there, right?
[2024-08-08T22:48:11] Yamal: 🤦🏼‍♂️

[2024-08-08T22:55:15] GABE: So much.
[2024-08-08T22:56:20] haku: i want to see the 70h g30. yea thats unfortunate what happened. cant you just go back to germany and take it?
[2024-08-08T22:56:57] GABE: I'd have to bash his doors in to get there, also they could be at his dad's. So that's two houses To go into, rather than one.
[2024-08-08T22:57:08] GABE: the risk is too high. I've went into houses before, but this just isnt it
[2024-08-08T22:57:49] haku: man i thought germans were honorable people
[2024-08-08T22:58:18] GABE: Id so do it if they had a 100% chance being there, but 50% just won't cut it .
[2024-08-08T22:59:02] GABE: Going into a house, chances being something isn't there, is totally insane.
[2024-08-08T23:02:19] GABE: I should've cloned his keys. Then I could've waited till he got out. But thing is, I'm not mentally ill, so it didn't cross my mind
[2024-08-08T23:03:05] haku: no do not commit crime. not worth it buddy
[2024-08-08T23:03:20] GABE: I only need 700 More euros, which would've been like 300 if I didn't get robbed.
[2024-08-08T23:03:33] haku: remember to asses people when you meet em. never fully trust
[2024-08-08T23:03:33] GABE: 700, not a lot when I start getting paid September.
[2024-08-08T23:05:42] haku: only ones you should fully trust are the vendors here.
[2024-08-08T23:05:45] GABE: I assessed him hard, he lied all the time. I asked him if I could have some of his Adderall, next day his Adderall box on the shelf goes missing,, then he says "oh I only got a few left, I'll sell them to ya for 5 a pop" I paid, sure. I didn't really care. i had deadlines. Second time he lied majorly was the "G30 being at his dad's" yet I saw it in his basement Hidden away, lol.
[2024-08-08T23:06:03] GABE: Both fatal lies.
[2024-08-08T23:06:46] Jan: Who?
[2024-08-08T23:06:56] GABE: I went in there cos I locked myself out, and he was in the city, and I needed to piss lol, so I pissed in the community basement.
[2024-08-08T23:07:06] GABE: If I left to piss, the apartment door would lock me out
[2024-08-08T23:07:10] GABE: I was super fucked

[2024-08-08T23:08:32] GABE: I did it in a monster can, don't worry, I'm no monster.
[2024-08-08T23:08:37] GABE: Hah, no pun intended.
[2024-08-08T23:09:22] GABE: I just needed some privacy and the community basement was right there. I saw the scooter through the little cracks in the wall, which was kinda a locked fence that each tenant has.
[2024-08-08T23:09:39] GABE: If I didn't lock myself out, I would've never seen it there.. I was peering in and being a bit nosy, I had HOURS being locked out with no phone.
[2024-08-08T23:13:44] GABE: Eh fuck it, I'll tag the fucker. Hey @nosoudoppi, How do you like my VESCS? It's been what, 10-12 weeks now? and you haven't replied to me on anything, fuck you I guess. Enjoy your fun scooter that I funded.
[2024-08-08T23:13:44] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-08-08T23:18:14] GABE: @nosoudoppi @nosoudoppi @nosoudoppi
[2024-08-08T23:18:20] haku: i use to work at a nightclub. tiesto performing almost every saturday evening.
[2024-08-08T23:18:46] haku: he had a residence here for a while
[2024-08-08T23:19:59] NetworkDir: Teisto c0ncert is natural drug
[2024-08-08T23:21:16] GABE: sure sounds like it
[2024-08-08T23:21:39] haku: i used to like that stuff when i was younger.
[2024-08-08T23:21:46] GABE: Drugs?
[2024-08-08T23:21:54] haku: i did not know he still performed
[2024-08-08T23:22:38] NetworkDir: He have a concert tomorrow i think in las vegas
[2024-08-08T23:23:06] haku: alot of djs perform here.
[2024-08-08T23:23:49] haku: steve aioki lol. thats my time
[2024-08-08T23:47:13] Yamal: The truth is that I have never had a stage in electronic music but I worked one summer for the group Amnesia and I met quite a few DJs (2014) I remember Adam Beller or whatever they say and a duo of Romanians who had a lot of trouble
[2024-08-08T23:47:22] GABE: No, it won't decrease resistance, because the thicker layers act as a longer wire, so more heat is dissipated Think of this, you making a long coil, but you make it longer, and expect it to dissipate Less heat? The wiring of cells is a heating element by law, it is necessary to try to eliminate it
[2024-08-08T23:48:49] GABE: Plus, the "weld" is not a real weld, it's just a connection between 2 mini points, the alloy cannot be just be created all around. SAME power through more mini points (coils) (distance)= more power loss slipping through Ohms law. Copper = Mini points, or length reduced by 10x
[2024-08-09T01:06:55] cihan: I understood what you mean but I probably couldn't explain what I wanted to in the question. For example we use 0.2 mm nickel strips only for all connections. When we spot weld first group of parallel cells first and then spot weld connections to the next cell group, current has to pass through 0.4 mm nickel and then x length to next cell group. But when we spot weld series connections first and then parallel connections current has to pass 0.2 mm nickel and then same x distance to next cell. So we're adding a little bit of more nickel for the current to pass through. Since almost all current passes between series connected cells I thought it's better to make connections between series connected cells more conductive and connection between parallel connected cells less conductive.
[2024-08-09T01:10:00] haku: i dont think it matters but i did series first then parralel when nickle
[2024-08-09T01:11:25] haku: <photos/photo_16723@09-08-2024_01-11-25.jpg>

[2024-08-09T01:12:30] haku: i havent tested this battery yet. its only 18v
[2024-08-09T01:12:34] cihan: It probably reduces resistance a little bit.
[2024-08-09T01:16:09] cihan: I couldn't really understand how it looks like inside.) But you have a lot of insulation and I wonder how you insulated and how I should do it. I was thinking about only placing those round battery insulation gaskets on positive cell terminals but today I was also recommended to place same insulation paper between each cell group. My biggest worry is a failing and burning battery and I'm still not sure about making battery really safe.
[2024-08-09T01:17:25] haku: i just used round fishpaper.
[2024-08-09T01:17:50] haku: james designed these holders to provide extra insulation too
[2024-08-09T01:17:59] cihan: What are those purple areas?
[2024-08-09T01:18:19] haku: its 3d printed holder by james
[2024-08-09T01:19:30] haku: <photos/photo_16725@09-08-2024_01-19-30.jpg>
[2024-08-09T01:19:44] cihan: Ahh, OK now I understand. 3d printer is great for custom holder. I found ender 3 v3 se cheap lately but didn't buy after reading lots of problems.
[2024-08-09T01:20:12] haku: 3d printer can be useful for alot of things.
[2024-08-09T01:22:53] cihan: Sure, some time later it'll probably be something like a hand tool and take its place in most homes but good models are still expensive.
[2024-08-09T01:24:07] cihan: Did you place a square insulator on whole battery too? Whole battery is covered with something also covering the round fish papers.
[2024-08-09T01:24:32] haku: i used insulation tape and fishpaper.
[2024-08-09T01:25:02] haku: maybe i shouldve used more. never fully drained this battery but works good
[2024-08-09T01:26:32] cihan: Is this the kind of insulation tape you used? Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! US $1.31 | 1/3/5M 18650 Battery Insulation Gasket Barley Paper Li-ion Pack Cell Adhesive Glue Fish Tape Warp Electrode Insulated Pads https://a.aliexpress.com/_EvYlz6D It's just fish tape, same as the round ones but as a big tape.
[2024-08-09T01:26:54] haku: yes
[2024-08-09T01:31:55] haku: i think my mistake was wiring the + i shouldve moved to the side
[2024-08-09T01:33:34] cihan: Let me tell you what I have and please tell me what else I should buy for making the battery. 1. Spot welder 2. Cells 3. 0.2mm Copper sheet 4. 0.1mm nickel plated strip 5. Round insulation gasket 6. Kapton tape 7. Heat shrink battery wrap 8. Soft padding for wrapping over heat shrink 9. Solder, soldering iron 10. Amass as150 connectors 11. 8 AWG cable 12. Fish tape What else should I have?
[2024-08-09T01:34:22] haku: looks good! .2 copper only if pulling lots of amps
[2024-08-09T01:34:45] haku: im passing on my knowledge from the battery lords
[2024-08-09T01:34:59] cihan: Yes, positive and negative wires would probably better be both on side but it depends on how you'll place the battery.
[2024-08-09T01:36:23] cihan: Thank you, I forgot battery holder brackets. I also got them but probably won't use them since I cannot place copper sheet when I use those brackets.
[2024-08-09T01:36:25] haku: this forgotten guy is .2 copper. 10p 40t
[2024-08-09T01:36:48] cihan: 40s?
[2024-08-09T01:37:00] haku: no 20s 10p
[2024-08-09T01:37:37] cihan: What does 40t mean?
[2024-08-09T01:37:58] haku: sorry samsung 40t cells.
[2024-08-09T01:38:57] cihan: Sorry, I just understood. It looks very rigid. How do you plan connecting the wires to terminals?
[2024-08-09T01:41:09] haku: folded copper
[2024-08-09T01:41:45] haku: let me find it.
[2024-08-09T01:43:26] haku: i might just finish this battery to test the esc and motors before my frame comes in
[2024-08-09T01:43:36] cihan: What is the white insulation material between each parallel cell group? Do you just build one group of parallel cells and then wrap it with that insulation material on sides before making series connections?
[2024-08-09T01:44:34] haku: thats the printed holders.
[2024-08-09T01:45:02] haku: this is the folded main + and -
[2024-08-09T01:46:49] cihan: You use red cables for both positive and negative, right? At first I thought each cable was for positive connection to each controller in a dual controller dual motor design.
[2024-08-09T01:47:13] haku: no.
[2024-08-09T01:47:25] cihan: Ahh no, they're connected to same copper sheet, sorry
[2024-08-09T01:47:30] haku: these are just connections for +
[2024-08-09T01:48:51] cihan: Printed cell holder looks perfect. Each time I ask something I cannot understand answer is printed cell holder. It's something necessary for a good battery.
[2024-08-09T01:49:34] haku: no its not necessary.
[2024-08-09T01:50:31] cihan: For me it makes the battery more safe. Battery becomes much more rigid.
[2024-08-09T01:50:53] haku: it looks good with transparent wrap imo
[2024-08-09T01:53:19] cihan: Certainly. But Chinese holder I got covers cell tops. So I cannot use copper sheet with the bracket holder I bought. Brackets should hold cells on sides. But the one I have holds cells on top and bottom. So I cannot cover the cell terminals with copper sheet.
[2024-08-09T01:53:48] cihan: Do you mean the wrap wrapping whole battery?
[2024-08-09T01:54:42] haku: ive seen copper done with china cell holders
[2024-08-09T01:56:13] haku: im just not sure wich cell holder.
[2024-08-09T01:56:56] cihan: Picture is not very clear but holder extends on cell top. I don't know how I'll use copper sheet with this holder.
[2024-08-09T01:57:15] haku: i see what you mean
[2024-08-09T01:57:26] cihan: Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! US $4.88 | 18650 cell battery holder flat head dislocation bracket compact bracket can be spliced, module battery pack bracket https://a.aliexpress.com/_EIG21pn This one
[2024-08-09T01:57:46] haku: the photo also shows button top cells
[2024-08-09T01:57:58] cihan: Yes, they're not flat head

[2024-08-09T02:00:33] cihan: I can cut or sand down the parts holding the cells and then apply hot melt silicone to cells and make holders hold cells from sides but this probably doesn't make sense.
[2024-08-09T02:05:01] cihan: This one seems better choice. But it's never as rigid as a 3D printed one. I think hot melt silicone is rigid and strong however I'm still afraid of harming cell's original insulator on side and making 2 series connected cells touch each other. I should certainly have this fish paper between each series cell group.
[2024-08-09T02:13:52] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: especially when it's the gate pin the issue are explosive 💣
[2024-08-09T02:15:44] cihan: Why do we use this fish paper or barley paper instead of usual electric isolation tape?
[2024-08-09T02:15:56] cihan: It's cellulose paper as I read
[2024-08-09T02:16:18] haku: because regulae elecrtrical tape becomes sticky and loose i think
[2024-08-09T02:16:51] haku: this has been the standard for battery makers. idk why too
[2024-08-09T02:17:10] cihan: Good ones can resist 70-80 degrees for very long time but could be sticky in time, you're right.
[2024-08-09T02:20:19] haku: this also makes the battery rigid. just wrapped on the sides. Just found this amazing item on AliExpress.

[2024-08-09T02:27:22] cihan: Thank you, I always saw kapton tape being used for last wrap around the soft layer but I can use this one around the cells. It's like Amazon prime tapes. I always liked them, they're strong but probably they have kind of adhesive activated with water vapor so Amazon tape needs a vaporizer tool while using it.
[2024-08-09T02:28:21] haku: just use this for rigidity. kapton insulation tape for covering welds
[2024-08-09T02:29:20] haku: this also leaves a residue
[2024-08-09T02:30:16] haku: super strong though. i use em for weight handles
[2024-08-09T02:31:16] cihan: I read a little about kapton tape. It's probably preferred since it works in very wide temperature range.
[2024-08-09T02:32:14] cihan: Kapton is polyimide. Best motor winding insulations are also polyimide, withstands 250 degrees celcius.
[2024-08-09T02:34:00] Unknown: Yes, us 🏁🏁🏁
[2024-08-09T02:45:35] haku: <photos/photo_16729@09-08-2024_02-45-35.jpg>
[2024-08-09T02:45:46] cihan: What's it?
[2024-08-09T02:46:41] haku: sorry its a fiberglass board thingy. ive seen folks use this too for rigidity and insulation
[2024-08-09T02:47:51] haku: before applying shrinkwrap or put bms ontop
[2024-08-09T02:49:12] cihan: Seems useful, thank you. And thanks for all the information, it was very useful for me.
[2024-08-09T02:51:17] haku: ofcourse. all this stuff i learned from the battery lords. im just a disciple
[2024-08-09T02:57:20] cihan: Rep to the lords then :)
[2024-08-09T04:18:52] haku: can anyone reccomend a good usbc data cable that will work with vesc?
[2024-08-09T05:08:17] haku: is there a hall sensor cable adapter for halls in the package when you buy the 80/100 or ill have to crimp some? i bought mine a year ago. forgot where it is.
[2024-08-09T05:08:53] haku: this kind of jst doesnt fit. i remember having that for my dual 100/100
[2024-08-09T05:10:47] haku: this kind of jst.
[2024-08-09T05:41:32] haku: dam its all mixed up with all the spintend stuff. gotta look for it. is this jst gh or something?
[2024-08-09T05:42:42] haku: its the same one with 84/200 yea?
[2024-08-09T05:44:03] haku: cool ty
[2024-08-09T05:44:40] haku: for stock g30 motor should i still run halls?
[2024-08-09T05:46:03] haku: its will be a 36v maybe 30 or 40a only
[2024-08-09T05:54:38] Noname: You have to kick start if you dont
[2024-08-09T06:00:59] haku: oh. i see. ill wire the halls then. that would be difficult on a bike
[2024-08-09T06:02:10] Noname: Well it shudders without movement. And doesn't always start, have to know what your doing without
[2024-08-09T06:14:00] Yamal: 300A phase 🤩
[2024-08-09T06:14:23] haku: yea for a 36v 30a battery
[2024-08-09T06:16:58] haku: now i just need to design a battery and vesc mount for the bike.
[2024-08-09T06:17:03] haku: gl to me lol
[2024-08-09T06:22:26] haku: <photos/photo_16732@09-08-2024_06-22-26.jpg>
[2024-08-09T06:22:57] haku: heres gh 1.25. might be difficult crimping these
[2024-08-09T06:22:57] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-08-09T06:34:44] Yamal: You can open an Alliespress store in your neighborhoods now
[2024-08-09T06:35:37] Yamal: Hakutron industries
[2024-08-09T07:03:20] Noname: Just don't use dual ratchet crimper. Doing my Nucular connectors found manual pliers better. Did wire then sheathing holder. It's still a pita
[2024-08-09T07:03:49] haku: funny not alot of americans buy from aliexpress. if they only knew hehe
[2024-08-09T07:04:34] Noname: Store lists quantities but add to cart doesn't work
[2024-08-09T07:05:55] haku: i have used these for jst 2.0. i just dont know what to use for gh 1.25
[2024-08-09T07:06:23] Noname: Ah yeah fuck those things right in the bin
[2024-08-09T07:07:08] haku: i dont want to support chinaese tbh. but when your poor theres no other choice
[2024-08-09T07:07:44] haku: these ones i have suck or what?
[2024-08-09T07:08:23] Noname: Better results 1 at a time. The other ones are a complete fuck show.
[2024-08-09T07:09:10] haku: ill see if i have those
[2024-08-09T07:09:30] Noname: Hard to see as it covers the entire connector. Then it's dual so sometimes crushes the insulation till it splits but the wire is loose.
[2024-08-09T07:11:41] Noname: Also didn't fold the prongs correctly. I pinched them closed a bit first. Legs should be parallel not splayed out otherwise they smash and don't roll over and make an "m" shape crimp
[2024-08-09T07:12:32] Noname: Hope you got good eyes and a steady hand.
[2024-08-09T07:13:03] haku: ive done it before with jst 2.0. this gh is alot smaller. 😭
[2024-08-09T07:13:50] Noname: Well I used different jst also so idk mabey easier 4 u
[2024-08-09T07:14:29] haku: we will see. hopefully i find the spintend harness.
[2024-08-09T07:15:15] haku: i think all i need to crimp will be the bluetooth connection because 100/100 dual uses different connectors
[2024-08-09T07:15:40] Noname: These miniature things
[2024-08-09T07:16:06] haku: dude gh 1.25 is smaller
[2024-08-09T07:17:04] haku: ill use my microscopic asian eyes
[2024-08-09T07:17:04] Noname: Were Phd 2.0 good luck
[2024-08-09T07:17:17] Noname: Your already squinting
[2024-08-09T07:18:36] Yamal: Doesn't America get along well with China?
[2024-08-09T07:18:49] Noname: Well of you have extra cables mabey pull out the wires and plug into the 5 pin
[2024-08-09T07:19:00] Noname: I like Brad 😆
[2024-08-09T07:19:03] haku: yea. but i rather support american buissness
[2024-08-09T07:19:34] Yamal: Who is Brad
[2024-08-09T07:19:40] Noname: Haku
[2024-08-09T07:20:05] haku: if i buy this same things from amazon they get a huge cut and pay taxes to help economy
[2024-08-09T07:20:35] haku: buying straight to the source is smarter but i feel dirty
[2024-08-09T07:21:02] Yamal: You talk about freedom, you talk about love for your homeland and your country, but then you buy everything at Alliespress
[2024-08-09T07:21:18] Noname: It all comes from China anyway
[2024-08-09T07:21:42] haku: like i said when your poor thats the best option
[2024-08-09T07:22:10] haku: you pay triple in amazon
[2024-08-09T07:22:58] haku: i support local buissneses though. mom and pop shops.
[2024-08-09T07:23:16] Noname: Nice name for hookers
[2024-08-09T07:23:24] haku: hahaha
[2024-08-09T07:24:01] haku: no tax on tits
[2024-08-09T07:25:06] haku: anyway offtopic
[2024-08-09T07:28:47] Yamal: You could set up a store with two franchises, one for each of your cities, a workshop store
[2024-08-09T07:29:48] Yamal: East vs West
[2024-08-09T07:30:42] haku: someday. im sure pevs and evs will ve a huge thing one day. not here in vegas though. alien rides closed thier shop here. prolly did not get traction
[2024-08-09T07:32:16] Yamal: I think that in Las Vegas you have to do well sunflower cultivation
[2024-08-09T07:32:49] haku: i can open a cactus store.
[2024-08-09T07:33:07] Yamal: a good tractor and a woman who makes your bread every day haku days😎 xD
[2024-08-09T07:33:43] haku: no more women. headache and lost lots of money
[2024-08-09T07:35:15] Yamal: I had a friend who slaughtered 10/12 chickens and the women would peel them with hot water while he worked, or cut wood for a wood stove, amazing
[2024-08-09T07:36:50] haku: i cant even own chickens in my yard. not allowed in residencial areas
[2024-08-09T07:45:38] Yamal: Hakurider how long until your frame arrives?

[2024-08-09T09:53:17] puneDir: I wanted to test the shunt
[2024-08-09T09:53:21] puneDir: It was too much this time
[2024-08-09T09:54:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: For the base Policlor befenil beats all
[2024-08-09T09:55:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Which time it was not too much?😏
[2024-08-09T09:56:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If its a rod type shunt desolder and make it less long ,dont make it thicker
[2024-08-09T09:56:36] Yamal: Hey long time man
[2024-08-09T09:56:41] Yamal: All is okay ?

[2024-08-09T10:06:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like this Germann m365 Folding mechanism totaly dead guy drilled up to size 7 ,the pinhole Ble wire was repaired by tape ,no soldering It was damaged in two places Motor and rear rim both super died by Bearings Motor cable damaged Than i open it and this crap is inside,than i notice ut desoldered phase connetor
[2024-08-09T10:07:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than i turned it on, hold the connetor and start engine it works , than solder back and error4 😁

[2024-08-09T10:14:40] Yamal: Inokim still sleepy?
[2024-08-09T10:17:56] Finn: Yeah the connectors like to desolder themself. Also its a clone controller😁
[2024-08-09T10:18:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah crap xbot
[2024-08-09T10:19:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I saw an xbot now with ,4 wires where bms wire is normaly, that has turn signal😁
[2024-08-09T10:19:30] Finn: G30 controller should work but with custom.batt
[2024-08-09T10:20:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Partly done,need bug with front sus ,but no time also we have some insurance laws now and till not fixed cant be used ,coz i dont pay just to have it at home
[2024-08-09T10:21:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Ohh i replaced with same crap that's what owner wanted ,i could put normal contoller in but 🤷‍♂
[2024-08-09T10:22:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you get a g30 batt full naked and heat shrink it you can fit it in a pro
[2024-08-09T10:23:41] Finn: Yeah
[2024-08-09T11:49:18] GABE: 801D sadly not allowed to weld copper like that
[2024-08-09T11:50:54] crimeware: Germans are the worst, they don't know else then doing shit!
[2024-08-09T11:51:29] crimeware: They Preach Holy Water but drink Wine!
[2024-08-09T12:19:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Yeah pointless rules like 20... Any xiaomi can be easy driven by one hand with 25 ,even over speed bump or potholes Who cant, probably Should not scoot at all😅
[2024-08-09T12:23:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Nowdays there is a lot like this but let us notice that decision makers are not the ppl
[2024-08-09T12:26:45] puneDir: I fixed the 25 euro esc
[2024-08-09T12:26:53] puneDir: How can i adjust the shunt for 25a
[2024-08-09T12:27:09] puneDir: 270a is not needed
[2024-08-09T12:37:53] GABE: what ohm is it at now
[2024-08-09T12:39:56] puneDir: i have no clue
[2024-08-09T12:40:26] puneDir: I dont have ir meter
[2024-08-09T12:40:56] cihan: I have expectations from 801H. If it arrives 🙄
[2024-08-09T14:02:22] GABE: Huh, can you not measure the resistance with a meter
[2024-08-09T14:20:53] puneDir: No
[2024-08-09T14:20:59] puneDir: You need internal resistance tester
[2024-08-09T14:21:26] GABE: For.. resistors?
[2024-08-09T14:23:07] Yamal: <photos/photo_16739@09-08-2024_14-23-07.jpg>
[2024-08-09T14:30:49] puneDir: For shunt resistors
[2024-08-09T14:32:07] Rose: Hey there Saboor, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-08-09T14:41:55] haku: thats not copper. this is just nickel
[2024-08-09T14:47:26] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Bridge it's ok, just the mos will stay off, but the worst is if the gate are just not connected and as you said it's but visible sometime but it's just not connected and then that make big issue
[2024-08-09T14:48:11] Finn: Resistance is too low to measure with a normal device
[2024-08-09T14:48:55] Paolo ⁭: It's possible
[2024-08-09T14:56:05] puneDir: How?
[2024-08-09T15:04:47] Paolo ⁭: Power supply and put your voltmeter in "mV" mode
[2024-08-09T15:05:25] Paolo ⁭: Then put probes on the two side of shunt, and measure the vdrop.
[2024-08-09T15:05:25] puneDir: formula?
[2024-08-09T15:05:30] puneDir: Ahhh
[2024-08-09T15:05:54] Paolo ⁭: Then if u go to school there's easy calculation , just ohm law😂
[2024-08-09T15:06:10] puneDir: Ik 😁

[2024-08-09T16:12:30] GABE: I didnt know what ohms were till a few months ago, heh, I thought they worked in the opposite way
[2024-08-09T16:16:25] 'lekrsu': How

[2024-08-09T16:34:43] puneDir: I need to finish puneron asap Only have 84100hp on hand
[2024-08-09T16:38:20] NetworkDir: 60-80A
[2024-08-09T16:38:35] puneDir: theorically 120
[2024-08-09T16:43:47] Yamal: 80A battery
[2024-08-09T16:43:56] puneDir: Shit
[2024-08-09T16:44:02] puneDir: I need 120 min
[2024-08-09T16:46:54] Yamal: stock phase A 135
[2024-08-09T16:49:52] Yamal: Power solution 💸
[2024-08-09T16:50:36] puneDir: Its not about the money
[2024-08-09T16:50:45] puneDir: I cant order anything cuz 30 euro customs limit
[2024-08-09T16:52:18] Yamal: I mean, powerful Vesc controllers are worth money.
[2024-08-09T16:54:56] Yamal: but it's for the ebike right?
[2024-08-09T17:41:17] puneDir: Yes
[2024-08-09T17:43:58] 'lekrsu': If there wasn't a reason to move before, it is now
[2024-08-09T17:44:24] puneDir: What
[2024-08-09T17:44:48] 'lekrsu': Not being able to import is a deal breaker
[2024-08-09T17:48:34] puneDir: Yeah
[2024-08-09T17:48:47] puneDir: I need university first
[2024-08-09T17:50:58] 'lekrsu': You can move for that though.
[2024-08-09T17:51:39] puneDir: pfff

[2024-08-09T18:45:25] haku: we are accepting brown skin men of military age if you go thru mexico. free cirizenship
[2024-08-09T18:46:17] haku: hurry this deal wont last long
[2024-08-09T18:46:44] puneDir: 30 euro law fucked me up atm
[2024-08-09T18:51:06] haku: when you come to america dont forget to smuggle some stuff. i like coke
[2024-08-09T18:58:11] puneDir: turkey is fucked
[2024-08-09T18:58:18] puneDir: 30 euro limit Instagram ban
[2024-08-09T18:59:01] haku: if you cant import stuff then people selling stuff will inflate thier prices too
[2024-08-09T18:59:08] puneDir: yes
[2024-08-09T18:59:17] puneDir: but wtf is even instagram ban
[2024-08-09T19:01:02] haku: no idea whats going on there but time to get out while you still can
[2024-08-09T19:05:27] cihan: Try your chance, you'll get your money back anyway if package is rejected as t customs.
[2024-08-09T19:05:56] haku: are you in turkey too?
[2024-08-09T19:06:32] cihan: Yes
[2024-08-09T19:28:51] cihan: Is there any kind of not too expensive and big enough soft pad which is thermally conductive and electrically insulating for wrapping the battery? Can the battery sit tight inside the deck without screws or is there a screwless solution?
[2024-08-09T19:29:58] haku: idk use foam so it doesnt bounce around
[2024-08-09T19:31:49] haku: watching a youtube right now about the battle of berlin 1945. holy crap what a different time
[2024-08-09T19:32:20] cihan: This kind of foam? I think it will work but it certainly doesn't allow heat escape. Wouldn't it be a problem?
[2024-08-09T19:33:52] haku: no not that. i forgot wich foam. just cut little squares of it just to hold the battery
[2024-08-09T19:34:38] cihan: Thanks, I'll search more
[2024-08-09T19:37:57] GABE: He should genuinely consider, like unironically
[2024-08-09T19:39:30] haku: we need smart american speaking migrants.
[2024-08-09T19:39:54] haku: punedir perfect for that
[2024-08-09T19:43:55] haku: remember vote red when you get here
[2024-08-09T19:46:21] puneDir: This works too I use it to mount the battery temporarily
[2024-08-09T19:46:35] puneDir: <photos/photo_16742@09-08-2024_19-46-35.jpg>
[2024-08-09T19:46:39] puneDir: i guess this esc is fixable

[2024-08-09T23:17:53] crimeware: It's getting worse for him
[2024-08-09T23:18:52] crimeware: Massive W
[2024-08-09T23:19:25] haku: its very different in america. its war against the woke.
[2024-08-09T23:19:39] haku: doesnt matter the color.
[2024-08-09T23:21:01] haku: but the woke normally has a darker tone unfortunately. not all
[2024-08-09T23:21:14] crimeware: I am a transaprent person, I name the devil by the name :)

[2024-08-10T00:48:57] haku: dam why doesnt the US have cool stuff like this.
[2024-08-10T00:52:56] Yamal: Georg Simon…
[2024-08-10T00:56:50] 'lekrsu': Let's ask him by Swish messages😁
[2024-08-10T00:56:53] haku: so best cell as of the moment for high discharge is 40pl
[2024-08-10T00:57:29] NetworkDir: On market yes but produced and coming soon arrived no
[2024-08-10T00:57:36] NetworkDir: Moli do fuckeria things
[2024-08-10T00:57:40] NetworkDir: Like 60C
[2024-08-10T00:57:59] haku: but 40pl like 3mohms
[2024-08-10T00:58:26] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_16750@10-08-2024_00-58-26.jpg>
[2024-08-10T00:58:26] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_16751@10-08-2024_00-58-26.jpg>
[2024-08-10T00:58:53] NetworkDir: The 50C for charge and 100C peak crazy
[2024-08-10T00:58:59] haku: wow
[2024-08-10T00:59:32] NetworkDir: Capacity eh... bad But for values very fuckeria this cells used on racing and short distance things like drag cars - drag scooters and etc
[2024-08-10T01:00:08] Lisa: I have same tester as him haha
[2024-08-10T01:00:20] haku: thats prolly $10 a cell when it comes out.
[2024-08-10T01:00:20] NetworkDir: 125A charging 1 cell 250A dischagre XD The est mohm i think ~1.5mohm or 2mohm
[2024-08-10T01:01:02] NetworkDir: Also capacity yes low but you have a super fast charge you can charge instantly
[2024-08-10T01:02:10] Patrick: Yea, buying it more times probably
[2024-08-10T01:02:40] Patrick: buying better tester too then
[2024-08-10T01:02:52] Patrick: -50€ xD

[2024-08-10T01:04:14] haku: how long will it be till available to the market?
[2024-08-10T01:04:27] NetworkDir: SeX getting 1000A-100kW with 30s5p is crazy
[2024-08-10T01:04:38] haku: asking like i can afford it 😭
[2024-08-10T01:06:47] haku: 40pl has a waitlist to buy right now?
[2024-08-10T01:08:04] haku: im not even considering it. i can only afford cells on sale
[2024-08-10T01:08:36] haku: 3 weeks to 4 weeks i think
[2024-08-10T01:09:52] haku: yea. to test vesc and motor before i build battery. then ill use it as a range extender. thats the plan but no idea if gonna happen
[2024-08-10T01:10:48] haku: the bms on 40t is weak.
[2024-08-10T01:13:27] haku: not yet. its a 325peak ant.
[2024-08-10T01:14:01] haku: 120 is nominal i think
[2024-08-10T01:14:37] haku: that one is for sure gonna be completed. i really liked that frame since last year
[2024-08-10T01:15:12] haku: good idea
[2024-08-10T01:16:03] haku: unfortunately i just have 2 325 ants 22s and the other 20s
[2024-08-10T01:16:40] haku: my sons battery arriving today. thats gonna keep me busy for a while till frame arrives
[2024-08-10T01:18:01] haku: its the same as the 22s 325a peak
[2024-08-10T01:18:21] haku: i missed the last ali sale.
[2024-08-10T01:19:15] haku: nice. ill check it out.
[2024-08-10T01:19:19] haku: thanks bud
[2024-08-10T01:24:32] Yamal: When we observe the temperature of the BMS, it is really always a few degrees higher inside the cell,? How many approximately?
[2024-08-10T01:25:46] Yamal: I don't have download bms..
[2024-08-10T01:26:53] Yamal: <photos/photo_16752@10-08-2024_01-26-53.jpg>
[2024-08-10T01:27:53] 'lekrsu': how long?
[2024-08-10T01:28:44] 'lekrsu': Why's literally everything discounted
[2024-08-10T01:30:28] 'lekrsu': Eh, price reduction looks fake
[2024-08-10T01:31:35] 'lekrsu': strange
[2024-08-10T01:32:33] 'lekrsu': 40% off on Monorim products that cost the same, tf
[2024-08-10T01:33:39] 'lekrsu': some are higher than before uhh
[2024-08-10T01:36:23] 'lekrsu': It's nice when they have coupons that provide actual reduction in price
[2024-08-10T01:38:40] 'lekrsu': 50% off buy now!! Coins!!
[2024-08-10T01:42:58] haku: this one priced decent. would this be enough for 12p p42 the next one up is 1000 peak i think.
[2024-08-10T01:49:55] haku: i dont think that layout will fit. it has to be folded like surron bat
[2024-08-10T01:49:59] 'lekrsu': The way every bms size is random is trippy
[2024-08-10T01:50:34] 'lekrsu': and the lack of easily accessible wiring diagrams
[2024-08-10T02:06:03] sombre_enfant: Very good
[2024-08-10T05:51:06] haku: 500 samsung 35e for my little guys bike and future "projects".

[2024-08-10T12:54:44] Yamal: To start, good afternoon because it's already after 12... I am far above trying to pretend anything, or trying to capture anyone's attention, with 2 children and some gray hair already in my beard, I only like to share my experiences with vesc and some other routes, it is evident that I like the "reggae" music, tell you that I don't have social networks, so I will never chase followers for a "like", I have calluses on my hands from working and I'm happy about it, I also don't see that people share their experiences "a lot" and that is totally respectable, as is your reaction!! We are in a free country, I tell you this from the brotherhood or in case the video of him goes for me
[2024-08-10T13:02:14] Face de Pin Sucé: Damn

[2024-08-10T15:38:34] Dexter: Charles will be pleased
[2024-08-10T15:51:55] GABE: 40c charge? that is faster than fuel.
[2024-08-10T15:52:50] GABE: takes 5 min to get a full tank right, but 40c is 1.5 minutes.
[2024-08-10T15:58:36] 'lekrsu': Can't even charge at that speed in a normal house at 20S6P, not even close.
[2024-08-10T17:10:27] 'lekrsu': It's alive
[2024-08-10T17:18:37] GABE: Dont tesla based home chargers do that wattage?
[2024-08-10T17:20:08] 'lekrsu': You don't run car chargers on 10A fuses
[2024-08-10T17:20:22] puneDir: <photos/photo_16769@10-08-2024_17-20-22.jpg>
[2024-08-10T17:20:29] puneDir: Box is 1 cm bigger than supposed to be
[2024-08-10T17:20:35] puneDir: Cant finish puneron today
[2024-08-10T17:20:37] puneDir: ;(
[2024-08-10T17:20:44] puneDir: Box doesnt fit inside
[2024-08-10T17:20:44] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. puneDir has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-08-10T17:20:49] GABE: Where are they wired to.
[2024-08-10T17:21:16] GABE: im still relatively new to AC. it is impossible to wire 2 AC outputs in parallel or series, correct?
[2024-08-10T17:21:27] 'lekrsu': You've got higher current fuses at the phases.
[2024-08-10T17:21:43] GABE: that is actually too wide of a question, i dont think anyone can answer that.
[2024-08-10T17:21:57] 'lekrsu': 3 phases is common, 20A for the whole thing (I guess?), 10A for each.
[2024-08-10T17:22:14] GABE: as in, two 3kw outputs for 6kw, and so on, up until you can charge at 40c?
[2024-08-10T17:22:18] 'lekrsu': Needed to steal power via that to run our electrical wood cutter
[2024-08-10T17:24:28] 'lekrsu': phases are offset by 120deg
[2024-08-10T17:27:08] 'lekrsu': (tell me if I'm wrong but) seems as if it's 16A per house approximately @ 400V between phases, so 11.1kW?
[2024-08-10T17:27:50] 'lekrsu': So it's still not enough to charge XA3 6P at 20S
[2024-08-10T17:46:50] Rogerio Figueiredo: People used to change the flipksy fets
[2024-08-10T17:49:20] Paolo ⁭: Who buy flipsky is because have no budget, so in this case yes it worth to repair
[2024-08-10T18:07:01] Chris Culver: Just picked this up for uh... $30? Yeah roughly that...

[2024-08-10T18:19:41] GABE: Wait. that's a zero.
[2024-08-10T18:19:41] GABE: wtf
[2024-08-10T18:19:59] GABE: I thought that was a kugoo and was about to start laughing
[2024-08-10T18:20:21] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yes I have two 75100 box version I will send to a friend to see if he can fix it
[2024-08-10T18:20:43] puneDir: Fuck puneron I was gonna ride it but stupid box

[2024-08-10T18:20:59] puneDir: ONLY THING LEFT IS A FUCKING BATT BOX
[2024-08-10T18:21:17] GABE: show it running

[2024-08-10T18:21:22] Rogerio Figueiredo: The other it has the diode burned
[2024-08-10T18:21:36] GABE: Can't you make a temporary box
[2024-08-10T18:21:38] GABE: ghetto
[2024-08-10T18:22:02] puneDir: With what
[2024-08-10T18:23:39] GABE: Fucking tape dawg
[2024-08-10T18:23:44] GABE: that's what I did
[2024-08-10T19:06:51] Paolo ⁭: I doubt he was formally owner😂
[2024-08-10T19:07:50] GABE: sold for 0.3% of original price
[2024-08-10T19:07:51] GABE: handy
[2024-08-10T19:26:13] haku: what is the price difference between flipsky makerbase and spintend?
[2024-08-10T19:27:58] haku: wow. where do you find these things
[2024-08-10T19:36:41] 'lekrsu': Sometimes 2x
[2024-08-10T19:37:42] puneDir: This sucks
[2024-08-10T19:42:18] haku: is this the older model zero10?
[2024-08-10T19:42:29] haku: never seen a folding stem one

[2024-08-10T22:01:18] haku: that battery is 22s 10p yea? what cells again?
[2024-08-10T22:14:11] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 22s11p LG m50lt
[2024-08-10T22:14:37] haku: thats nice!
[2024-08-10T22:16:22] haku: anyone have the wiring diagram to this ant bms. need the 10s instead of 16s diagram please.
[2024-08-10T22:19:01] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I want to make a new same configuration but with molicel p45b we will do it when this battery is dead when we don't know ☺️
[2024-08-10T22:19:53] haku: good idea. you have the parts for all that power.
[2024-08-10T22:20:31] cihan: With many phase amps can I run a motor for 5 minutes if phase cables are 12AWG. I also wonder phase cable thickness of G30 too.
[2024-08-10T22:20:43] haku: or you can wait for the next gen cells

[2024-08-10T22:26:46] crimeware: Only positive thing is, we are allowed to do wheelies 😂
[2024-08-10T22:27:02] crimeware: No officer can stop you for doing wheelies
[2024-08-10T22:31:36] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I think we'll do it next year.
[2024-08-10T22:35:42] haku: i had to rewatch this. motivation for squat day lmao
[2024-08-10T22:36:52] crimeware: hahahahaaha
[2024-08-10T23:18:53] GABE: Those cells turn me on.
[2024-08-10T23:19:13] GABE: real fucking shit tho what he was saying
[2024-08-10T23:20:40] haku: lol. about being a bottom. gadam idk how people are proud to be that. funny to see what this woke culture is about
[2024-08-10T23:20:59] GABE: phase cable of 30 is just as shit as pro 2.
[2024-08-10T23:20:59] GABE: They have to supply it.
[2024-08-10T23:21:23] haku: i prolly accodentally threw it or lost it.
[2024-08-10T23:21:30] haku: im asking seller.
[2024-08-10T23:21:45] GABE: Main ground and go tip toe to the 10s
[2024-08-10T23:21:49] GABE: Main ground is always main ground
[2024-08-10T23:21:53] GABE: The first black wire..
[2024-08-10T23:21:56] GABE: work your way up to 10s
[2024-08-10T23:22:09] GABE: 11th wire is 10s..
[2024-08-10T23:22:09] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-08-10T23:23:44] cihan: 12 AWG?
[2024-08-10T23:27:02] GABE: Hah, stock g30 phase cable Is made from chinesium.
[2024-08-10T23:27:13] GABE: oh no no, 12awg for phase is overkill
[2024-08-10T23:27:23] GABE: well, not really but it's very good
[2024-08-10T23:27:37] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Do you know the maximum download they support?
[2024-08-10T23:27:48] GABE: The maximum load?
[2024-08-10T23:28:06] GABE: they do 20a cont as im aware? check specsheet if you wanna verify.
[2024-08-10T23:30:33] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I'm going to look
[2024-08-10T23:34:58] GABE: The fact you made a pack with cells but don't know their specs is quite frightening
[2024-08-10T23:38:25] crimeware: <video_file>
[2024-08-10T23:38:49] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <photos/photo_16783@10-08-2024_23-38-49.jpg>
[2024-08-10T23:39:55] cihan: Overkill? How? 12 AWG is rated for 20 amps as I read.
[2024-08-10T23:40:00] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: But that is not entirely true. I understood that it has 14.5 but I never knew the peaks.
[2024-08-10T23:42:39] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I have never known the maximum discharge
[2024-08-10T23:42:42] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Previously I always used the “normal discharge” that is why I never knew the maximum
[2024-08-10T23:43:33] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Previously I had 20s11p with same cell but the controller did not ask for more than 120 a
[2024-08-10T23:46:30] GABE: You're talking like a colllegetard. wires don't work that way
[2024-08-10T23:46:41] GABE: how do you think VESCS push 1000a phase with like 8awg phase Also it's AC not DC.
[2024-08-10T23:47:29] GABE: Yes, 12awg that is - non silicone -extremely long - running continuously for years those numbers are for industrial shite
[2024-08-10T23:49:12] GABE: LIPOS can output like 1000a peak and "200a" cont through like 12awg cos they're like 5cm long
[2024-08-10T23:53:57] cihan: I'm surprised since Navee n65 phase wires are 12 AWG and strangely battery cable is also 12 AWG.
[2024-08-10T23:55:47] cihan: It's fine for short durations but I'd use thicker wire anyway.
[2024-08-11T00:10:03] GABE: Always use more than is needed, wire is the last thing anyone should be skimping on, lol.

[2024-08-11T12:19:35] Paolo ⁭: I had 150a batt 350 phase 40a fw Same motors same voltage as you
[2024-08-11T12:20:06] Yamal: I removed the FW after doing the straight, and now I'm going with the 200A which are very fun, it seems that everything is correct, tonight we'll see if I go out on the straight without FW but you could see it 126...
[2024-08-11T12:20:29] Yamal: How is posible ? 🤯
[2024-08-11T12:20:46] Yamal: 150 batt x2 350A x2 🤯

[2024-08-11T17:02:32] GABE: May set the tyre on fire
[2024-08-11T17:14:19] GABE: These ones have the most volatile cells in them, the big vapes
[2024-08-11T17:14:57] GABE: It would burn a hole right through and set the entire truck on fire. I've tested the batteries.
[2024-08-11T18:04:56] GABE: ah fuck, i walked right into the g30 frame. pays off to have a full head. hurt a bit. I think its getting too cramped in here cause of 2 projects at once sitting there.
[2024-08-11T19:12:28] haku: why is the phase cables like that?
[2024-08-11T19:40:32] Paolo ⁭: Bigger wire, Less power loss and less heat
[2024-08-11T20:10:40] rosheee: 1. G30 single vsett motor with 20s 2. Nami eburn which got burned by g30

[2024-08-11T21:03:05] puneDir: (Shit esc /puneron 45h inrunner)
[2024-08-11T21:03:33] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-08-11T21:03:48] puneDir: It wasnt doing previously
[2024-08-11T21:03:58] puneDir: I did motor detection while chain is on
[2024-08-11T21:04:02] puneDir: Maybe because of that
[2024-08-11T21:05:07] Face de Pin Sucé: no
[2024-08-11T21:05:34] Paolo ⁭: No I mean insta lens is like that, they can't capture so fast frames

[2024-08-11T21:10:47] haku: only legit way
[2024-08-11T21:15:27] Paolo ⁭: Motor saturation, you are pushing very high current throught 1000w motor
[2024-08-11T21:15:38] puneDir: Its hearable at the end of the videp

[2024-08-11T21:16:11] Paolo ⁭: You are running con square wave controller?
[2024-08-11T21:16:31] puneDir: probably
[2024-08-11T21:16:39] Paolo ⁭: Is normal, if you mod shunt too much it does like this
[2024-08-11T21:16:42] GABE: dude, the motor is probably saturated
[2024-08-11T21:16:46] puneDir: Yes

[2024-08-11T21:17:01] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't care of dragy, we already calibrated our device based on dragy, and we are now running our tests in a tunnel, dragy doesn't work in tunnel
[2024-08-11T21:17:06] GABE: I had the same issue with the 800w.
[2024-08-11T21:17:06] puneDir: I fixed it

[2024-08-11T21:18:40] puneDir: What can i do to prevwnt it until i get a better esc
[2024-08-11T21:20:50] NetworkDir: Why you don't put 84100?
[2024-08-11T21:22:36] puneDir: Not enough batt amps
[2024-08-11T21:22:54] NetworkDir: Still better than this shitty esc
[2024-08-11T21:23:10] puneDir: Shit esc puts 100+ a easily

[2024-08-11T21:40:36] GABE: I thought so too, bitch professors not replying to emails during the most stressful times
[2024-08-11T21:40:45] GABE: just the now makes no sense .
[2024-08-11T21:40:59] puneDir: Wtf
[2024-08-11T21:41:27] 'lekrsu': Maybe showing strain at that specific moment
[2024-08-11T21:52:44] GABE: i was fretting again, all i have to do is learn 10 physics functions to get 100 on that stupid exam
[2024-08-11T21:52:51] GABE: i cant wait till this is over
[2024-08-11T21:52:58] GABE: ill never let the work stack up like this again

[2024-08-11T22:17:45] Давно пора: Someone knows how to make hard speed limit(with ebrake involved?)
[2024-08-11T22:27:53] GABE: @Mltra ill attempt to change the cells out tomorrow, i vividly remember taking them out and seeing they were all 4.00 or 4.01
[2024-08-11T22:28:13] GABE: So ill make the molis the same voltage and pray
[2024-08-11T22:33:22] Yamal: When you ride your proyect
[2024-08-11T22:33:46] Yamal: Now you are Haku 2°xD
[2024-08-11T22:33:49] GABE: October.
[2024-08-11T22:34:09] GABE: i get 700 and 700 is whats needed to finish
[2024-08-11T22:34:40] Yamal: G30 70h yes?
[2024-08-11T22:34:45] GABE: will function with half the battery.
[2024-08-11T22:34:55] GABE: singular 20s6p.
[2024-08-11T22:35:08] GABE: ah, this is why molicel is great. run with half the tank? no problem. crazy to think how powerful these cells are.
[2024-08-11T22:35:20] GABE: dont even need the other pack made till i get used to 20kw, ill prob die off the bat with 40.
[2024-08-11T22:36:39] Yamal: you promised 150kmh I won't forget it
[2024-08-11T22:36:47] GABE: Ill do it.
[2024-08-11T22:37:05] GABE: But with the second pack. i need enough power to get away from cops. range too
[2024-08-11T22:37:10] GABE: they WILL try pull me over.
[2024-08-11T22:37:28] GABE: meh actually possible with one pack ^ Molicel POWER
[2024-08-11T22:43:03] Yamal: The end you want to use ubox 85/250?
[2024-08-11T22:46:26] GABE: Yes. it'll be enough for 40kw. Just motors MAY Not handle it. Prob only up until 30kw
[2024-08-11T22:46:41] GABE: But motors are already bought, no going back
[2024-08-11T22:46:54] Jan: Cables cant handle it
[2024-08-11T22:47:24] GABE: They are made from glass fiber and silicone. Are you sure?
[2024-08-11T22:47:30] GABE: They're lonnyo 70h wires
[2024-08-11T22:47:33] Jan: Then if you fix all issues, tire grip is an issue at 35kW
[2024-08-11T22:47:39] GABE: <photos/photo_16796@11-08-2024_22-47-39.jpg>
[2024-08-11T22:47:47] Jan: Ah 11inch
[2024-08-11T22:47:47] GABE: PMT slicks won't like it?
[2024-08-11T22:47:58] Jan: 11inch pmt slicks ok
[2024-08-11T22:47:59] GABE: Yes, so I don't have to change?
[2024-08-11T22:48:05] Jan: All good
[2024-08-11T22:48:09] Jan: 10inch more issue
[2024-08-11T22:48:11] GABE: Motors won't like 35kw no?
[2024-08-11T22:48:45] Jan: I dont know
[2024-08-11T22:48:51] Jan: I thought it was about G30
[2024-08-11T22:49:24] GABE: That is so stupid, that 10 inch Has worse wires. they should really change that.
[2024-08-11T22:49:27] GABE: Kind of unacceptable.
[2024-08-11T23:00:32] haku: the i love china motors are the authentic ones. everything else is knockoffs
[2024-08-11T23:02:35] Yamal: I was referring to finishing the project.. :)
[2024-08-11T23:03:09] haku: my parts are in a chinese museum. endorsed by shi jin ping

[2024-08-11T23:04:56] GABE: what scooter do you have btw?
[2024-08-11T23:05:13] Yamal: It's going to be fun to challenge and beat the elegant surrons
[2024-08-11T23:05:30] GABE: it takes a 72v stock pro 2 to beat a surron
[2024-08-11T23:05:39] haku: he goin to lead that group someday
[2024-08-11T23:05:43] GABE: lmfao
[2024-08-11T23:05:46] GABE: speed wise
[2024-08-11T23:05:51] GABE: in a race
[2024-08-11T23:05:57] GABE: stock surron*
[2024-08-11T23:06:09] haku: modded scoot vs modded surron. idk man
[2024-08-11T23:06:22] haku: ive seen some crazy ones
[2024-08-11T23:06:29] GABE: ah, i meant like passing kids on surrons on the 72v mijia
[2024-08-11T23:06:30] GABE: lol
[2024-08-11T23:06:33] GABE: is just funny
[2024-08-11T23:07:18] haku: one pebble and that mijia flying. surron boys be laughing
[2024-08-11T23:09:22] haku: unfortunately scooters are a woke mans ride here. very sad

[2024-08-11T23:20:52] GABE: Guy seems to not be responding after i asked him to give me the money he owes me for that tyre change, lol. If he wants to end a friendship for a measly 30 euros, sure be it.
[2024-08-11T23:21:00] GABE: Weird cause he paid the last 10 times. I Told him to let me know if he doesnt wanna pay, cause i dont wanna sit around for money that isnt coming. id appreciate a heads up. Like if you cant pay just say that.
[2024-08-11T23:42:45] GABE: Physics is algebra from HELL
[2024-08-11T23:42:56] GABE: from the bottomest layer of hell

[2024-08-12T00:43:26] haku: whats your peak battery amps again?
[2024-08-12T01:12:47] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-08-12T01:16:56] haku: is that current on vesctool dc or phase? im noob
[2024-08-12T01:17:26] Yamal: Is phase
[2024-08-12T01:17:55] haku: how much do you have your dc amps set on vesctool?
[2024-08-12T01:18:06] Yamal: I just arrive home opening the scooter
[2024-08-12T01:19:01] Yamal: When he stopped, I thought I saw a bright light to the right of him. scooter...
[2024-08-12T01:19:13] haku: ive had that error before? is that bms cuttoff?
[2024-08-12T01:21:25] haku: is it too much amps? or what?
[2024-08-12T01:22:39] haku: when i finish my mini bike scooter. i want the honor of you tuning it.
[2024-08-12T01:24:44] Noname: We need to buy James a gift for tuning because we are 2 dumb.

[2024-08-12T01:26:32] Noname: I'll buy him the neighbors sheep.
[2024-08-12T01:26:48] haku: lmao
[2024-08-12T01:27:35] haku: dont do that he might turn my bike scooter into a bomb
[2024-08-12T01:28:12] Noname: If I could afford a hooker it's me first.
[2024-08-12T01:28:33] haku: come to vegas. very affordable rates
[2024-08-12T01:28:54] Noname: It's to hot 🔥

[2024-08-12T01:44:57] Noname: Damn that's some carnage. What controller?
[2024-08-12T01:45:41] haku: dam the pcb exploded
[2024-08-12T01:46:00] haku: @jamessoderstrom can fix that
[2024-08-12T01:46:43] Noname: I'm no arson investigator but I'd imagine it started where the giant hole is
[2024-08-12T01:47:18] haku: you just need to glue a new mosfet and off you go.
[2024-08-12T01:48:45] haku: im glad your safe @jamaludin_algarnati that couldve been dangerous at those speeds. BV almost gave you a viking funeral
[2024-08-12T01:51:52] Yamal: 60h22/3
[2024-08-12T01:54:26] Yamal: It's time to sleep, tomorrow I have to walk to work, until I clean everything and so on I can't go on a single engine, but I'm sure I can, I'm back on a single engine, I'm sorry guys
[2024-08-12T01:56:50] haku: your safety is my priority buddy. worry not about the scooter. elon is a generous man. he will provide
[2024-08-12T01:58:12] Yamal: I saw fireworks on my right under my feet today, a few thousandths of a second but I saw them...
[2024-08-12T01:58:55] Face de Pin Sucé: Hahahaha
[2024-08-12T01:59:02] haku: ive blown some gas engines before. the feeling is mutual
[2024-08-12T01:59:03] Face de Pin Sucé: Little focer / tronic250 classiq
[2024-08-12T01:59:25] Face de Pin Sucé: I've had this exact exploded pcb few times with those shitty controllers
[2024-08-12T01:59:50] haku: sleep tight dont let the blue man find you in your dreams
[2024-08-12T02:00:57] haku: how much battery amps can you really give these tronics?
[2024-08-12T02:04:54] haku: dang thats like the dual spintend 100/100
[2024-08-12T02:06:42] haku: so many blown up tronics 250 here ive noticed
[2024-08-12T02:07:22] haku: we should have a compilation album
[2024-08-12T02:10:04] Yamal: For me 2 have been enough, I will try to go with a motor as a utility vehicle until I can assemble something big if I ever can because now I just have to buy a plane ticket and it is impossible to buy ESC
[2024-08-12T02:10:38] haku: plane ticket for what?
[2024-08-12T02:10:48] haku: mexico?
[2024-08-12T02:11:18] Yamal: to reunite with my family, I'm going on vacation to Singapore for a month
[2024-08-12T02:13:45] haku: @jamessoderstrom is field weakening neccessary. ive never used it
[2024-08-12T02:17:04] haku: you need to set aside battery amps for that yea? wont work when you are already using peak amps?
[2024-08-12T02:17:54] haku: im not very educated in this matter
[2024-08-12T02:20:37] haku: big words. but i kinda understand
[2024-08-12T02:22:19] haku: no im good. 45miles is enough.
[2024-08-12T02:22:37] haku: what is back emf exactly?
[2024-08-12T02:22:59] haku: i keep reading that word. by vesclord council
[2024-08-12T02:24:59] haku: gotcha. i looked it up.
[2024-08-12T02:54:23] haku: that is pretty cool. https://youtube.com/shorts/ttw5ajRvpYk?si=SgVr_7vp-MSjkkzQ
[2024-08-12T03:31:30] Noname: @Bradhaku perfect for when ups drops off your Ali packages
[2024-08-12T03:43:10] haku: check this out boys. designed by james.
[2024-08-12T03:48:22] haku: need to rewrap 40cells.
[2024-08-12T04:30:57] rosheee: yah but they full sended 100A battery max he said so let's go 150-190A
[2024-08-12T04:31:18] rosheee: mosfets were sucé but caps blew up but they still sended
[2024-08-12T04:31:26] rosheee: even with 4 or idk 8 or so caps
[2024-08-12T04:31:43] rosheee: yes
[2024-08-12T04:31:46] rosheee: setup profile
[2024-08-12T04:31:46] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. roscheeee has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-08-12T04:32:12] Давно пора: For some reason ebrake does not apply
[2024-08-12T04:35:19] rosheee: send xml of config pls which fw version?
[2024-08-12T04:36:09] rosheee: 380A phase 150-220A battery 😆 and fw 0
[2024-08-12T04:36:12] rosheee: each m0t0r
[2024-08-12T04:37:20] haku: gotcha. this actually works really well
[2024-08-12T06:13:30] haku: dammit i was trying to be creative. murika and all but this looks more like the blue mans flag. 😭
[2024-08-12T06:13:42] haku: <photos/photo_16804@12-08-2024_06-13-42.jpg>
[2024-08-12T06:13:59] haku: too late to cancel print
[2024-08-12T06:17:59] Yamal: Goodbye, goodbye shaman! It was nice while it lasted!🫡❤️‍🔥
[2024-08-12T06:18:59] haku: was that the same broken one before?
[2024-08-12T06:19:50] Yamal: Before 250R
[2024-08-12T06:20:22] haku: the broken one.
[2024-08-12T06:20:48] haku: you were doing single motor for a while i remember
[2024-08-12T06:23:38] Yamal: The only thing I was not happy about is that they were not suitable for the circuit, since they were very stressed, now it is time to reconsider and think about which ones will be suitable for me,, candidates x12 and seven, the problem is that if you want infineon tolt in the seven they must be 30 seven, the (18) are tolt but not infineon tolt""
[2024-08-12T06:24:24] haku: did you have 250r? just use those
[2024-08-12T06:24:27] Yamal: 💸
[2024-08-12T06:25:18] haku: or get a 12fet spintend if your on a budget
[2024-08-12T06:25:23] haku: maybe a g30 too
[2024-08-12T06:27:02] Yamal: I don't have one, I have already decided not to use this plate anymore, I generally like to "run" and stress them a little with strong starts from time to time so it is better not to ride them anymore! Why say okay, I mount them and set the configuration soft,,! but it won't be like that, so it's better to use the money on something that will hold comfortably
[2024-08-12T06:28:15] Yamal: It's been a few months but I've spent it like a baby.
[2024-08-12T06:28:17] haku: get spintend 12fet. cheap and proven reliable by alot of folks
[2024-08-12T06:28:44] Yamal: Another option ,, shull another
[2024-08-12T06:29:27] haku: sure if you really want to go all out. might aswell get motors too
[2024-08-12T06:29:55] haku: 33x2 if you want fast. im not into that life
[2024-08-12T06:31:00] haku: maybe consider a g30. good frames
[2024-08-12T06:31:31] haku: lots of parts and alot of folks work on it
[2024-08-12T06:37:52] Yamal: 22/3 are very good, good torque!
[2024-08-12T06:39:11] haku: but you ride fast. racing speeds. racers use 33x2 i think.
[2024-08-12T06:39:34] Yamal: 33/2 for the future in projects with higher voltage batteries
[2024-08-12T06:39:35] haku: just using lots of amps
[2024-08-12T06:39:58] haku: what is your goal.speed exactly?
[2024-08-12T06:42:24] Yamal: My goal is like everyone's, having good torque, with a good top speed and that your battery can deliver it to you without trying too hard.
[2024-08-12T06:43:17] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-08-12T06:44:49] haku: when i test my motors hopefully hopefully it will still have torque. 570a should do it i think
[2024-08-12T06:45:30] Yamal: How good it is to walk ^^, it makes you lose fat without losing muscle mass....XD
[2024-08-12T06:46:02] haku: thats how i warm up. good stuff
[2024-08-12T06:47:17] haku: running is a different story. screw that
[2024-08-12T06:47:41] haku: thats why i have a scooter to run my dog
[2024-08-12T06:47:48] Yamal: Walk is just for big babys
[2024-08-12T06:48:33] haku: i make sure my pulse doesnt get too high.
[2024-08-12T06:51:29] Yamal: you are already a professional
[2024-08-12T06:51:52] haku: yea professional lazy.
[2024-08-12T08:40:57] puneDir: I want to make puneron dual motor
[2024-08-12T10:53:57] GABE: huh, why did this happen?
[2024-08-12T10:56:00] GABE: Yeeee cutoff during fwk kills everything, I don't think I'll use fwk ever again.
[2024-08-12T10:57:42] Yamal: too much time exceeding the controller limit,,; That controller comes for 5/8kw, I exceeded 20, that is, 10 per controller and also with fw...I also thought that the 200A would hold up well but in the end it broke, the ideal is 150A phase which is like it I have been carrying it all this time, when I can I will buy a 12 fet controller
[2024-08-12T10:59:37] GABE: Hah told you it would be a good idea
[2024-08-12T11:00:48] GABE: <photos/photo_16805@12-08-2024_11-00-48.jpg>
[2024-08-12T11:01:04] GABE: Do it this way. But im unsure if your frame will have space...
[2024-08-12T11:40:23] GABE: Look at this I found from 10 years ago lol that is one sick standing board
[2024-08-12T13:21:58] Rose: Hey there Yusuf, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-08-12T13:26:00] Yamal: Who
[2024-08-12T15:44:01] Diego: Guys, can you recommend me a vesc for a g30 to do dual motor 16S with stock g30 motors? I want to spend little. The battery absorption will be maximum 80A
[2024-08-12T15:44:53] GABE: Spintend purple dual box
[2024-08-12T15:45:03] GABE: max 17s I believe.
[2024-08-12T15:45:34] Diego: What is a more or less fair price?
[2024-08-12T15:45:40] GABE: Check website.
[2024-08-12T15:45:42] GABE: you'll see it
[2024-08-12T15:45:50] GABE: 250usd or so
[2024-08-12T15:46:02] Diego: Wow, I was hoping to spend a lot less
[2024-08-12T15:46:11] GABE: For vesc spintend is the cheapest best
[2024-08-12T15:46:16] GABE: Flip sky is risky
[2024-08-12T15:46:26] GABE: Buy cheap buy twice
[2024-08-12T15:46:58] Diego: Mmhh okay thx
[2024-08-12T15:47:36] Diego: If I spend 250 usd on the controller I will never get my money back
[2024-08-12T15:52:55] Lisa: Get dual ubox lite
[2024-08-12T15:53:03] Lisa: I think you come a bit cheaper out
[2024-08-12T15:54:56] GABE: I think thats it.
[2024-08-12T15:55:14] GABE: I got 350 usd of escs stolen from me, if that makes you feel better.
[2024-08-12T15:55:56] GABE: I think that's the one I mentioned
[2024-08-12T15:57:12] GABE: <photos/photo_16807@12-08-2024_15-57-12.jpg>
[2024-08-12T15:57:12] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-08-12T15:57:54] Yamal: This is no good for summer right.. ? :)
[2024-08-12T15:58:56] Diego: 🙈 no no.
[2024-08-12T15:59:08] Diego: https://a.aliexpress.com/_EyKWJFb This one at $70
[2024-08-12T16:01:52] Diego: 105,96€ | Makerbase VESC 75100 V2 84V 100A con PCB in alluminio basato su VESC per Controller di velocità elettrico per Skateboard/Scooter/Ebike https://a.aliexpress.com/_EGU3E3n
[2024-08-12T16:02:19] GABE: 80100 Is 127$ btw
[2024-08-12T16:03:01] Diego: One is full of capacitors, the other none at all. How can you get two similar results with such a noticeable difference?
[2024-08-12T16:03:10] Diego: 97€ to me
[2024-08-12T16:03:23] Diego: This 70€
[2024-08-12T16:03:38] GABE: Huh, for 80100?
[2024-08-12T16:03:48] Diego: Yes
[2024-08-12T16:03:51] GABE: Where
[2024-08-12T16:03:55] GABE: get 2 of them rhen
[2024-08-12T16:04:47] GABE: nvm that esc ist Shit
[2024-08-12T16:05:51] GABE: <photos/photo_16808@12-08-2024_16-05-51.jpg>
[2024-08-12T16:06:15] Diego: I got the wrong model, I meant this model here 97/99€
[2024-08-12T16:07:20] GABE: No need for the 200a Version If youll only be Pushing 2x g30 motors
[2024-08-12T16:07:29] Jason: <photos/photo_16810@12-08-2024_16-07-29.jpg>

[2024-08-12T16:09:08] Diego: Yes I know, I wanted to share the screenshots with the prices
[2024-08-12T16:09:11] GABE: This would work best and you save 60e
[2024-08-12T16:09:32] GABE: Itll Work for 16s perfectly
[2024-08-12T16:09:46] GABE: mid voltage
[2024-08-12T16:09:52] Diego: How come one doesn't have any capacitors? I'm ignorant
[2024-08-12T16:09:59] GABE: theyre INSIDE
[2024-08-12T16:10:21] Diego: Shouldn't they have external heads for safety reasons?
[2024-08-12T16:10:34] GABE: IT has room to Pop lol
[2024-08-12T16:11:06] GABE: If you want you can take it out though
[2024-08-12T16:11:17] GABE: Then you just place it how you want
[2024-08-12T16:11:22] GABE: but you have to secure it
[2024-08-12T16:12:04] Diego: None of the ones I showed you are dual motor...
[2024-08-12T16:12:39] GABE: I know you need two
[2024-08-12T16:12:45] GABE: you mentioned you had 2 motors earlier
[2024-08-12T16:13:28] GABE: dual vescs aren't that good
[2024-08-12T16:19:53] cihan: Rear wheel hub drive electric bikes almost always have higher top speeds than electric scooters with same power motor. Is it only because of tire rolling resistance?

[2024-08-12T16:28:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: How much battery amps do you give your controllers that you went with 14awg ?
[2024-08-12T16:29:40] 'lekrsu': Cells can only continuously do 39A by spec so not a lot. Only 30h motors.
[2024-08-12T16:30:37] 'lekrsu': Going single motor until suspension arrives.
[2024-08-12T16:31:08] 'lekrsu': Ironically charging to drive to install someone elses suspension
[2024-08-12T16:32:04] 'lekrsu': Within a month I'll be dual motor unless sip-scootershop.com delays my order
[2024-08-12T16:37:02] GABE: why is this so expensive.
[2024-08-12T16:45:05] GABE: a real engine is cheaper
[2024-08-12T16:45:18] GABE: right?
[2024-08-12T16:48:59] haku: what do you need a vespa motor for?
[2024-08-12T16:49:18] GABE: i was just checking out the site that leksru posted
[2024-08-12T16:58:05] Yamal: Vesc proyect :) :(
[2024-08-12T17:11:23] GABE: we need a car with vesc
[2024-08-12T17:11:31] haku: back in the day rebuilt honda b18 type r motors from japan was around that price. idk how much now
[2024-08-12T17:11:45] GABE: can 10000 fets in parallel work in harmony, even

[2024-08-12T18:09:46] GABE: this is Finals of first year Electrical Engineering
[2024-08-12T18:09:48] GABE: LOL
[2024-08-12T18:09:54] GABE: i just saw the question, i cant believe it.
[2024-08-12T18:09:54] Mirono escooters: Ah basic physics
[2024-08-12T18:10:05] Mirono escooters: We saw that in highschool lol
[2024-08-12T18:10:23] GABE: Yeah, the first year exams are a piss take. all anxiety gone now.
[2024-08-12T18:15:12] cihan: Is this glue good enough to fix the controller on the deck or should I use something else ? https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006181447989.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.main.1.71ba26360b6xE3&algo_pvid=05e27ca7-4225-417f-a635-56605e62ca8d&algo_exp_id=05e27ca7-4225-417f-a635-56605e62ca8d-0&pdp_npi=4%40dis%21USD%215.56%214.45%21%21%2139.68%2131.74%21%402103251317230855202372531e8f4f%2112000036165511647%21sea%21TR%21195302801%21X&curPageLogUid=Ji8JilwktfKF&utparam-url=scene%3Asearch%7Cquery_from%3A#nav-review

[2024-08-12T18:35:45] haku: thanks bro you designed it. i just colored it. yes super insulated.
[2024-08-12T18:36:36] haku: you will need to hoard lots of filament. its very wasteful
[2024-08-12T18:50:04] haku: fits perfect on the freedom walmart surron.
[2024-08-12T18:59:59] haku: thats pretty cool!
[2024-08-12T19:20:39] Diego: How do you position the cables so precisely while also taking into account the curve towards the bms. I could only do it if I cut the cables while I have the balancing connector connected to the bms
[2024-08-12T19:21:23] Jason: I just connect it and route it
[2024-08-12T19:21:26] Jason: and then cut
[2024-08-12T19:21:38] Jason: double sided tape helps
[2024-08-12T19:22:11] Jason: <sticker>
[2024-08-12T19:22:33] Diego: When you connect the cables to the series do you keep the balance cable disconnected?
[2024-08-12T19:22:43] Jason: nop
[2024-08-12T19:22:49] Jason: just always connected
[2024-08-12T19:23:12] Diego: If you use the wrong cable and accidentally go to the next series you don't damage the BMS right?
[2024-08-12T19:23:24] Diego: I dont know
[2024-08-12T19:23:34] Jason: yea
[2024-08-12T19:23:36] Jason: no damage
[2024-08-12T19:23:40] Diego: Ookay
[2024-08-12T19:24:14] Diego: It happens that the bms will not turn on. Reconnect the cables correctly and voilà
[2024-08-12T19:24:26] Diego: Thx
[2024-08-12T19:39:04] GABE: sounds cooler than a Tesla

[2024-08-12T21:03:08] Patrick: @Arne12348868 tell him what amazing values this thing gave you
[2024-08-12T21:03:38] Lisa: Hahah don’t buy this gave me 1200 Motor resistance then 500 then 1600 then 200
[2024-08-12T21:03:42] Lisa: It just can’t detect
[2024-08-12T21:03:45] Lisa: Buy ubox!
[2024-08-12T21:04:15] Lisa: Makerbase/flispky haha
[2024-08-12T21:04:26] Patrick: My flipsky 75200 not better😂
[2024-08-12T21:04:32] Paolo ⁭: Flipsky detection works shit
[2024-08-12T21:04:37] Paolo ⁭: I got a accident for this
[2024-08-12T21:04:48] Paolo ⁭: Then I always check parameters now and set manual
[2024-08-12T21:05:19] Lisa: Even Manuel doesn’t work perfect for me
[2024-08-12T21:06:16] Paolo ⁭: Not manual that you think, I mean I measure with my tools, not with vesc
[2024-08-12T21:06:39] Lisa: I mean ubox did detection But still
[2024-08-12T21:06:46] Paolo ⁭: I got 600 of inductance when it was 150
[2024-08-12T21:07:22] Paolo ⁭: Fuck shitsky
[2024-08-12T21:07:39] Patrick: Motor blocked?
[2024-08-12T21:08:01] Paolo ⁭: Strong brake
[2024-08-12T21:08:07] Paolo ⁭: But not shorted
[2024-08-12T21:08:16] Lisa: So Break is bad?
[2024-08-12T21:08:28] Lisa: Or what haha? Motor breaked hard?
[2024-08-12T21:08:38] Paolo ⁭: Flipsky works well when you manually set parameters
[2024-08-12T21:08:53] Patrick: My flipsky bad too if i use there detection values the vesc trys killing me once switching sensorless
[2024-08-12T21:09:04] Paolo ⁭: And only if you know what you are doing, but if you are beginner on beach I highly unrecommended
[2024-08-12T21:09:21] Paolo ⁭: People always want to try vrsc and buy flipsky, then after say vrsc is shit
[2024-08-12T21:09:44] Lisa: How can I manual measure motor settings?
[2024-08-12T21:10:07] Paolo ⁭: Just running , when was near to the top speed it brakes very strong
[2024-08-12T21:10:25] Paolo ⁭: You need tools, or measure with good vesc
[2024-08-12T21:10:38] Lisa: What tools?
[2024-08-12T21:10:56] Paolo ⁭: No is normal when you got fucked parameters by 3x times
[2024-08-12T21:11:14] Paolo ⁭: We're not talking about 30% wrong, that's 300%

[2024-08-12T23:08:55] GABE: The concept Parked very well though
[2024-08-12T23:10:07] haku: there are heavy duty roof racks for teslas now
[2024-08-12T23:10:44] haku: i just wonder what shit range you well get towing something this heavy
[2024-08-12T23:10:50] GABE: that is SUCH a good excuse for homelessness

[2024-08-12T23:15:59] Noname: Said I'm gonna put a gene on the NIU he way like that defeats the purpose. I'm like yeah no camping in hot parking lots
[2024-08-12T23:16:00] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Noname has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-08-12T23:18:18] haku: 3 wheel evs prolly cool. like a emoto with a sidecar. just for going around town. idk if street legal though.

[2024-08-13T02:46:57] cihan: Do you think measurement is incorrect?
[2024-08-13T02:48:08] haku: not just our allies but the whole world should get together against it. its starting!

[2024-08-13T10:30:10] Yamal: :(
[2024-08-13T10:33:04] 'lekrsu': Except than using some energy, no.
[2024-08-13T10:35:17] Yamal: Okay thanks @lekrsu ❤️‍🔥💸🫡
[2024-08-13T10:36:24] Yamal: Energy man, I say, that of the light on the license plate, little more
[2024-08-13T10:37:01] 'lekrsu': Just connect to the BMS and see if it's not drained from time to time
[2024-08-13T10:38:45] Yamal: That's complicated, I only have charging BMS, the download is free, but thanks anyway!

[2024-08-13T11:19:06] haku: these big acooters are going out of style. who buys these things. g30 only scooter that is really practical.
[2024-08-13T11:19:57] Yamal: Insert coin
[2024-08-13T11:22:14] haku: its like non american speaking countries that love it. they have good roads too
[2024-08-13T11:22:50] 'lekrsu': I see, check voltage by the charging port then? Or any other. VESC shows it as well if you've got ble on that one.
[2024-08-13T11:24:07] Yamal: g30 is for old school and professionals sector
[2024-08-13T11:24:24] haku: did you get your vesc fixed?
[2024-08-13T11:24:42] Yamal: 😂
[2024-08-13T11:24:45] Yamal: How?
[2024-08-13T11:25:00] haku: idk glue new mosfets?
[2024-08-13T11:25:47] Yamal: It takes more than a "picaso" to fix the little forcer, I have to wait for a while , I don't know how much...
[2024-08-13T11:26:54] Yamal: I don't know how many months it will be until I can acquire new controllers.
[2024-08-13T11:27:34] Yamal: but it has been good these "months" that I have had them
[2024-08-13T11:27:54] haku: just get a spintend practical and reliable
[2024-08-13T11:29:10] Yamal: a little more than €500 for the 12 spintend fet, I need to save but it would be a good option
[2024-08-13T11:30:29] haku: its good if you doing 20v. if you have $$ get the new ones and a new higher voltage battery
[2024-08-13T11:31:52] haku: higher voltage would be cool actually but when on budget batteries are expensive
[2024-08-13T11:32:33] Yamal: brother, my 20s10p 40t work great, new battery with more voltage equals speed motors and powerful electronics
[2024-08-13T11:32:50] Yamal: Not now😅
[2024-08-13T11:33:23] haku: you might need a new frame too to fit lots of batteries
[2024-08-13T11:33:44] Yamal: G30 maybe :)?
[2024-08-13T11:34:20] haku: sure. 20s is perfect. lots of folks here has done it
[2024-08-13T11:34:47] Yamal: 30s30p and 30 sEven 😂💸

[2024-08-13T11:36:02] haku: the whole olimpic crew plus blue guy and shemale boxer
[2024-08-13T11:37:58] haku: anyways whatever makes you happy i guess
[2024-08-13T11:41:32] haku: today i had to take my bike because im tired of standing.
[2024-08-13T11:43:13] Yamal: Just ride … Just ride…
[2024-08-13T11:54:55] cihan: Yes, they bought 5 BMW R71 and escaped them to Moscow and reverse engineered.
[2024-08-13T11:55:15] haku: how you fit 30s in that thing. 30s1p?
[2024-08-13T11:56:32] haku: smart. soviets used to be like china. reverse engineer everything western. lol
[2024-08-13T12:18:07] Rose: Hey there MF, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2024-08-13T18:46:29] haku: these youtubers are paid by these companies to promote scooters in the US. never have i seen any of thier scooters riden here.
[2024-08-13T18:48:29] haku: even when i went to LA and san diego california on a nice day. i never saw a single big scooter. just surrons and ebikes
[2024-08-13T18:48:58] haku: lots of g30 and g30 clones though
[2024-08-13T18:50:02] haku: maybe in east coast theres scooter riders
[2024-08-13T18:51:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: See rideout vids

[2024-08-13T18:53:58] haku: only time ive seen a nami in the wild was right before the pandemic.
[2024-08-13T18:56:01] haku: Noname do you have lots of scooter riders there?
[2024-08-13T19:13:54] Noname: Groups are mostly euc unfortunately. I run with the misfits whatever they have working at the moment, trike euc scoot bike etc. Surron groups are low lifes here, Ow get made fun of and have secret chats now. Ebike are slow and just dad/daughter rides.
[2024-08-13T19:17:48] haku: thats all i see here too. even in the heat. surron and emoto running in groups
[2024-08-13T19:18:34] haku: i saw a gt2 in the park once.

[2024-08-13T19:21:44] Noname: Unfortunately live to far from people so 😕 misfits are closest and I hate EUC anyway
[2024-08-13T19:22:07] puneDir: The one theyre making is better than qs138 :)
[2024-08-13T19:22:18] haku: i live in the the hood. the city.
[2024-08-13T19:22:24] puneDir: Also i cant buy qsmoto cuz customs
[2024-08-13T19:23:05] Noname: I have to load in truck ride and do it again to get home. So 70mi ride for a cheeseburger by myself it is.
[2024-08-13T19:24:23] haku: ive noticed big scooters were popular years back. way before i got into it. now its kinda frowned upon
[2024-08-13T19:24:44] GABE: Yes, the surron groups are always lowlives
[2024-08-13T19:25:11] GABE: <photos/photo_16825@13-08-2024_19-25-11.jpg>
[2024-08-13T19:25:18] puneDir: Shit esc gives 280a phase
[2024-08-13T19:25:31] puneDir: But heats up a lot
[2024-08-13T19:25:45] GABE: that's why the Kelly is so big
[2024-08-13T19:25:58] puneDir: Shit esc is good for 25 euro
[2024-08-13T19:26:06] GABE: those Chinese escs are literally just cheaper and better kellys
[2024-08-13T19:26:11] puneDir: 25 euro 100a batt 300+ a phase
[2024-08-13T19:26:19] GABE: insane how it is stable
[2024-08-13T19:26:22] GABE: Incredible
[2024-08-13T19:26:27] puneDir: it does more than 100a batt
[2024-08-13T19:26:41] GABE: so basically an 80100 spintend power wise.
[2024-08-13T19:26:55] Yamal: your scooter project, your studies!! your financing!!
[2024-08-13T19:26:58] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-08-13T19:27:41] GABE: Yeah, ive calculated how much I can smoke, And ill still have money Before November.
[2024-08-13T19:27:51] GABE: save 2/3 of my paycheck
[2024-08-13T19:27:57] GABE: use up 1/3
[2024-08-13T19:28:26] GABE: I just cannot do uni without being stoned cause it helps with socializing so damn much. Stops me from overthinking
[2024-08-13T19:28:35] puneDir: <photos/photo_16826@13-08-2024_19-28-35.jpg>
[2024-08-13T19:28:39] GABE: Socializing is the critical aspect for group projects etc..
[2024-08-13T19:28:46] puneDir: This just for 5-6 second but shit esc can do it
[2024-08-13T19:29:13] Yamal: Towards the stars Bowen, towards the stars
[2024-08-13T19:29:28] Noname: There's like 3 ebikes in my town. Think I'm the only scooter. 1 scoot guy I met at store was 30min away but not really friends with his type.
[2024-08-13T19:30:45] haku: theres 2 of us in the hood that use scoot to walk the dog. i think he has a g2 or g30. so that makes my vsett 9 the fastest in the hood
[2024-08-13T19:31:10] GABE: Will need 700 for the setup with 2x 80100s. I kinda wanna just make it and get it over with, and upgrade to 80250 later in the future.
[2024-08-13T19:31:36] GABE: Getting to uni is already hell as is, I need something that's reliable and goes 70kmh easily. (speed limit on that stretch)
[2024-08-13T19:32:00] GABE: The total cost is already 2.6k with 100a escs I'll be perfectly fine with 20s6p till I get used to it.
[2024-08-13T19:32:53] Yamal: Cowboy 🤠😂
[2024-08-13T19:34:51] Yamal: It will soon be a reality, who will be the brave one who will dominate the crazy bull with moli
[2024-08-13T19:36:46] haku: it will be a baby mustang horse
[2024-08-13T19:37:18] Yamal: beautiful breed
[2024-08-13T19:37:46] GABE: Oh yeah, yesterday at night I turned the lights on and saw a spider bigger than a 60a BMS
[2024-08-13T19:37:57] GABE: I was shaking so hard I couldn't vacuum it up
[2024-08-13T19:38:31] GABE: my mom is 50 she said it was the biggest spider she saw in the 50 years she was alive
[2024-08-13T19:38:58] Yamal: In America you have several races, among them the "pinto" typical of the American Indians.
[2024-08-13T19:39:40] haku: i think mustangs are decendants of spanish horses.
[2024-08-13T19:40:26] Yamal: There are many here, spiders are good insects, they eat mosquitoes in summer!
[2024-08-13T19:54:59] Yamal: I don't think it was a tarantula..?
[2024-08-13T19:55:23] GABE: Can't be. they aren't in Ireland
[2024-08-13T21:02:01] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-08-13T21:25:43] Diego: I never thought about having to worry about motor resistance as an important parameter to set. What can I expect if I buy vesc? I definitely don't want to spend more than $100-120 for a 16S 70-80A
[2024-08-13T21:56:52] haku: this is impressive https://youtube.com/shorts/T6lKWA0ybNw?si=xvpQmWXXCFalWjig

[2024-08-13T22:07:23] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: What I have been able to test, for my taste, is much better. This scooter assembly is completely loose. The hopes always give piston problems... hope pumps, punctures, magura 💣
[2024-08-13T22:15:25] Yamal: How the French listen to you is going to get angry...
[2024-08-13T22:22:23] Yamal: I never try hope before but look nice and dry :)
[2024-08-13T22:22:54] Yamal: magura is fresher and dirtier
[2024-08-13T22:22:59] haku: whos french?

[2024-08-13T22:23:51] haku: not after the olympics. my view of them has changed
[2024-08-13T22:24:07] Yamal: When the French went on scooters we still went on donkeys and this is the reality
[2024-08-13T22:24:28] haku: no wonder they like scooters. makes sense now
[2024-08-13T22:24:47] haku: i see the blue man riding a dualtron

[2024-08-14T13:19:12] NetworkDir: Because hardware limit 50H motor Stock motor cables Limited battery dischage 80150
[2024-08-14T13:19:50] NetworkDir: I thinking about put vsett super72 high kV motor on rear and push more currents
[2024-08-14T13:27:27] GABE: WE CAUGHT ANOTHER ON THE NIGHT CAMERA OMG ITTS HUGEEEE
[2024-08-14T13:27:40] GABE: THERE IS MORE OF THEM
[2024-08-14T13:32:52] Yamal: pick it up and throw it into the garden...
[2024-08-14T13:33:31] Yamal: Is it easy to buy LY engines in Turkey?
[2024-08-14T13:34:20] cihan: My spot welder order has been returned to Banggood without leaving China, We World Express, the company also doing the customs clearance in Turkey , probably cancelled shipping before package left China. :(
[2024-08-14T13:47:54] GABE: So, what are the options now?
[2024-08-14T14:06:49] cihan: I'm out of business.)) Maybe I go buy it myself from abroad or ask a friend living abroad to buy and bring me when coming Turkey some time.
[2024-08-14T14:07:57] cihan: Maybe I can't say it but people born after 2000 in Turkey could say "governing party is murderer of my youth"
[2024-08-14T14:09:05] GABE: any way to order something if it's marked value is cheaper?
[2024-08-14T14:09:13] GABE: at the cost of fucking up insurance.
[2024-08-14T14:12:04] cihan: No, not possible. It was possible maybe 15 years ago to declare value lower than real price or mark it as gift or commercial sample when less people used to shop from abroad. But now it's not possible, they just don't care what's written on it. If they find the value much cheaper than real value they can just make up a value for a similar item in Turkey and it's going to be more expensive than the real price.
[2024-08-14T14:15:10] Yamal: :(
[2024-08-14T14:17:19] cihan: 15 years ago posts with value lower than 75 euros were exempt of customs tax and over 75 euros tax was %18 for packages from European union and 20% from else world up to 1500 euros. Over 1500 euros you had to make declaration of import. Than they removed customs tax exemption and everything below 1500 euros was 18 and 20%. Then they made a change again and limited value to 150 euros and tax remained same. Another change was made later on and taxes were increased to 30% but they added extra 20% tax for hobby goods. Now tax is 60% and limit is 3p euros.
[2024-08-14T14:18:55] cihan: Price of Glitter 801H in Turkey, exactly double price of what I paid on Banggood. https://www.ankapil.com/glitter-801h-pil-punta-kaynak-makinesi?srsltid=AfmBOorD92YWbrGiZKaIBi3h7NWFozyv64pokJFkmi-Iikb6u0uMP7yQpEI
[2024-08-14T14:21:50] Yamal: 60%🤯
[2024-08-14T14:25:38] cihan: It's like 25-30% if I import it officially as a company. But that's for usual companies, governing party oligarchs don't pay that tax.
[2024-08-14T14:25:58] Yamal: Sad
[2024-08-14T14:26:23] Yamal: I hate taxes and customs
[2024-08-14T14:26:28] GABE: Jeez that's giving communist vibes.
[2024-08-14T14:29:51] cihan: They are necessary but should be applied properly according to necessities and equally for all citizens.
[2024-08-14T14:31:24] cihan: If Turks could comprehend what's happening in Turkey in last 20 years all of us would become communist already.)
[2024-08-14T14:37:47] Yamal: I had a colleague until recently studying in Turkey and he was very happy
[2024-08-14T14:40:41] Yamal: in Turkey studying Arabic xD
[2024-08-14T14:44:03] cihan: Studying bachelor's degree? And where is he from?
[2024-08-14T14:44:30] Yamal: He is from Spain
[2024-08-14T14:45:30] Yamal: studying Arabic without further ado,,, not at university or anything
[2024-08-14T14:46:29] cihan: But where does he study Arabic then, some kind of Islamic community giving education?
[2024-08-14T14:46:37] Yamal: Yes
[2024-08-14T14:47:15] Yamal: But now he is living in England,
[2024-08-14T14:47:59] NetworkDir: no
[2024-08-14T14:48:15] NetworkDir: anything hard
[2024-08-14T14:48:44] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: You mean everything?
[2024-08-14T14:48:48] Yamal: but the reason why he lives in England is very curious xD

[2024-08-14T14:51:15] puneDir: thanks customs i cant buy qsmoto
[2024-08-14T14:51:21] puneDir: What im gonna do now
[2024-08-14T14:51:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: At all ? Or it's just hard to import ?
[2024-08-14T14:51:58] puneDir: impossible to import actually
[2024-08-14T14:52:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So no surrons ?
[2024-08-14T14:52:28] puneDir: No
[2024-08-14T14:52:30] puneDir: Nothing
[2024-08-14T14:52:50] cihan: Well if he enjoyed being inside an Islamic community, I should question his likings and expectations from life. There is still 30-40 % of people supporting government considering this government is defender of Islam. :)
[2024-08-14T14:52:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Does the rules say like not more then 250w or somt ?
[2024-08-14T14:53:21] puneDir: Hes asking for 3000usd
[2024-08-14T14:53:27] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Bro goes deep
[2024-08-14T14:53:42] puneDir: Rules say if its more than 30 euro go suck my dick
[2024-08-14T14:54:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So u can import but high tax ?
[2024-08-14T14:54:33] NetworkDir: surrons avaliable for 10-15k$
[2024-08-14T14:54:37] puneDir: U cant import if its more than 30 euro
[2024-08-14T14:54:45] cihan: Middle East is an American saying so yes when you see it from USA. If you mean by culture and ethnically, no. Islam makes Turkey look similar to Arabs.
[2024-08-14T14:54:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Whaatatatatata ?
[2024-08-14T14:55:13] NetworkDir: you need a imports company for importing +30EUR and for example 150EUR product you should pay 400EUR at all xD
[2024-08-14T14:55:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm not from USA ahah I know the culture
[2024-08-14T14:55:34] cihan: You can import as a company or via an import company paying the tax and some commission.
[2024-08-14T14:55:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like what we have here but we sneek it bc customs people griddy
[2024-08-14T14:56:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Under the table sort of
[2024-08-14T14:56:34] cihan: Unfortunately
[2024-08-14T14:57:24] Yamal: He was simply learning Arabic because he wanted to learn it later on a trip to England they asked him to stay there, and he said if you find me a good woman to marry I'll stay, and they offered him a very beautiful half Pakistani and he stayed! ;)
[2024-08-14T14:57:25] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: We have yahno surrons vestt zero nami some of the dualtrons but not the big ones mukata and now we have one version of the wolf
[2024-08-14T14:57:51] cihan: Where are you from by the way?
[2024-08-14T14:57:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Who are they ahha
[2024-08-14T14:58:46] Yamal: friends and family of friends
[2024-08-14T14:59:25] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Offer sounds like a product bro
[2024-08-14T15:00:09] cihan: So is he a Muslim too?
[2024-08-14T15:03:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Finally a power bank for my stem deck
[2024-08-14T15:03:32] Yamal: Yes, but I remind you that you cannot talk about religion or politics among some other things in the group.
[2024-08-14T15:03:48] Yamal: Sound like natural thing bro
[2024-08-14T15:04:02] cihan: OK, I just wondered.
[2024-08-14T15:05:02] Yamal: More like cow 🐄
[2024-08-14T15:05:06] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-08-14T15:05:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's like shidochim oy yo yoy
[2024-08-14T15:07:12] cihan: Would heat exposure for very short duration with such a big soldering iron tip still harm the battery? https://youtu.be/hvaoEg8qn6g?si=qH4_UD4_Wliyv31m
[2024-08-14T15:07:55] NetworkDir: stupid idea
[2024-08-14T15:20:05] cihan: I'm sure cell top exceeds 200 degrees for very short duration but I have no idea how much heat will be transferred to the cell.
[2024-08-14T15:20:40] cihan: Of course that short duration is 20-30 milliseconds or less for spot welding, not comparable to soldering
[2024-08-14T15:21:42] puneDir: Why dont you buy aliexpress purple pcb spot welder
[2024-08-14T15:22:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Bro knows what shidochim?
[2024-08-14T15:23:42] Yamal: Sound like noddle
[2024-08-14T15:23:51] Yamal: Kimchi
[2024-08-14T15:24:17] Yamal: ^^'
[2024-08-14T15:24:50] cihan: Which one is it? Should I use it with a big lead acid or lipo?
[2024-08-14T15:26:54] cihan: This one? Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! US $25.63 | 12V Spot Welder DIY Kit 99 Gears of Power Adjustable Spots Welding Control Board for 18650 Battery 0.05-0.3mm Nickel Sheet https://a.aliexpress.com/_EzATuGh
[2024-08-14T15:28:48] puneDir: I use it with 72 amps car batt
[2024-08-14T15:28:49] puneDir: Yes
[2024-08-14T15:29:15] puneDir: I builded one 20s7p one 20s10p and much more packs with it Its pretty nice
[2024-08-14T15:29:22] puneDir: But you need a good battery
[2024-08-14T15:30:34] cihan: Can it weld 0.15 copper? It has 5 mosfets only.
[2024-08-14T15:33:43] puneDir: Not sure but it can weld 0.2 nickel easily
[2024-08-14T15:38:08] Yamal: 17 p ❤️‍🔥
[2024-08-14T15:54:10] cihan: Buying a car battery or taking car battery out for welding didn't seem practical. I would like to have something better with capacitor to use life long not to buy a spot welder again.
[2024-08-14T15:59:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No shidochim is the idea that the parents pair the wife and the husband (they do have some saying in it depends on how extraem is the family views)
[2024-08-14T16:03:56] cihan: What language is this word from?
[2024-08-14T16:04:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: German
[2024-08-14T16:04:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I think
[2024-08-14T16:07:56] Yamal: It has not been the case, but everything is very out of date lately and no one can stand anyone, so having trusted advice or opinion is good, and of course both must attract each other and be in agreement, I have seen cases of marriage and especially of divorce of a thousand types and it is a shame, I always say that we must return to the Origins and when respect, love and education flow they give way to success xD
[2024-08-14T16:09:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: (Sorry fix) the language origin is armic (lang spoken in 1320-1380)

[2024-08-14T17:04:35] Yamal: It's funny, a trip like that on an electric scooter carrying a gasoline generator
[2024-08-14T17:06:49] haku: sasha baron cohen is the OG troll.

[2024-08-14T17:11:35] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: That's in Jerusalem in a neighborhood called 100 gates a very extremist neighborhood but they won't harm him they will just get him off their area (unlike other anti LGBT out there )
[2024-08-14T17:12:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Aladin
[2024-08-14T17:13:17] haku: im glad jerusalem doesent approve these people.
[2024-08-14T17:14:11] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's not all Jerusalem its a small part in the end Jerusalem is a tourist city
[2024-08-14T17:16:31] haku: im also impressed how teenagers there can sling fully automatic rifles. we cant even own full auto in the US unless you have special licsenses
[2024-08-14T17:17:12] haku: civilian teenage men and women
[2024-08-14T17:18:28] haku: anyways vesc is awsome isnt it
[2024-08-14T17:20:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes they have a big vesc scene also
[2024-08-14T17:21:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like people installing vescs for their customers (I have a small part in the movement to dich ASI and go with vesc based controllers)
[2024-08-14T17:22:54] haku: here its fardriver. vesc is very rarely used in motos and surrons.
[2024-08-14T17:25:50] haku: it just needs one big youtuber to promote these new powerful vescs. the seven vesc and im sure it will catch on
[2024-08-14T17:26:03] GABE: It's black, but I don't wanna wake up in bed with that shit. I'd unironically have a seizure

[2024-08-14T19:51:54] GABE: Never thought I'd need motivation to finish a battery like @Bradhaku. I dont know, perhaps the fact it's such low power makes it anticlimactic to build, cause it's not THAT lit.
[2024-08-14T19:55:35] GABE: Hey guys, i think he finally blocked me.
[2024-08-14T19:55:45] GABE: Dude, I can't even get to uni cause you fucked me over. Dude, just get out of my face and block me already, because I'm not going to do it. Hope you're happy you lost the best friend you'll come across in a very, very long, long time.

[2024-08-14T20:31:34] GABE: True, but baggage will be 50, so 21+21=50
[2024-08-14T20:31:35] GABE: 100.
[2024-08-14T20:31:53] GABE: ive already thought about it.
[2024-08-14T20:31:57] 'lekrsu': & the effort 500
[2024-08-14T20:31:59] GABE: selling them here.
[2024-08-14T20:32:04] GABE: On this gc makes no sense
[2024-08-14T20:32:06] GABE: postage wise
[2024-08-14T20:32:11] GABE: and travel wise
[2024-08-14T20:32:32] GABE: even selling you that motor for 65 and the post being 60 was pretty cancer.

[2024-08-14T20:33:07] 'lekrsu': International shipping is a scam
[2024-08-14T20:34:19] 'lekrsu': Curious to see if they're profiting on it

[2024-08-14T20:35:23] Jan: Try it
[2024-08-14T20:35:26] GABE: Sure tho, if you find money, youll have to pay for the guy to come here + the post, and i will send it at no fee. cause whatever. you did me a favour, ill do one back.
[2024-08-14T20:35:31] Jan: Ground shipping probably safer
[2024-08-14T20:35:36] Hackintoshhhh: You bet i will try
[2024-08-14T20:35:49] GABE: ''officer its literally a hunk of metal''

[2024-08-14T20:36:55] GABE: not much work for me, just the guy comes with it, i pay, take out whatever you need to lower postage price, pack it and call UPS/DHL to pick it up.

[2024-08-14T20:40:58] puneDir: I mean no current and duty is having a crysis
[2024-08-14T20:41:11] Yamal: The las Sunday night controller die in speed test
[2024-08-14T20:42:10] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-08-14T20:43:38] Yamal: Also I ask you ,,,? Do you think my Focer early die with 200A ,, remember ? But it’s okay now I know yes!
[2024-08-14T20:45:34] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Foccer are piece of shit, i never liked it, but it should work for less than 250A without issue
[2024-08-14T20:45:36] Yamal: Yes
[2024-08-14T20:46:28] Jan: Everything blew over 200A for me

[2024-08-14T20:47:11] Jan: Even at 400A phase
[2024-08-14T20:48:32] 'lekrsu': How did that go?
[2024-08-14T20:50:11] puneDir: try to import batt to turley
[2024-08-14T20:50:52] 'lekrsu': DHL within Sweden should allow batteries if they're labeled at least
[2024-08-14T20:51:45] Yamal: I have been driving for a month and a half, 2, with 150A without fw without problem, going from 120kmh without effort, it was simply 2 nights of testing, the first with 27A fw with success and the second with 37A without success. with the intention to return to my sad 150A and continue living, the truth is that the scooter was going very very well until the controller exploded
[2024-08-14T20:53:07] 'lekrsu': !! Really? That's good to know. Doesn't their scans check size?
[2024-08-14T20:53:41] 'lekrsu': Have gotten parcels bounce back with a red label before 😁
[2024-08-14T20:55:00] 'lekrsu': Indeed
[2024-08-14T20:55:01] 'lekrsu': They shouldn't))
[2024-08-14T20:58:58] 'lekrsu': Ye the number of cell stuff is weird
[2024-08-14T21:00:08] 'lekrsu': they ship all this inside packages daily
[2024-08-14T21:05:30] NetworkDir: Anyway 2g battery can make a fire hazard
[2024-08-14T21:06:02] Noname: That's insane, I'd have a collection. Usually 3 to 400$ used and that's just dumb new is 600$.
[2024-08-14T21:07:02] GABE: do caps die when they recieve negative voltage? the capacitor on my xesc board that i reversed is not showing continuity? how is this possible?
[2024-08-14T21:08:08] GABE: the mosfets show correct continuity also, the back of the board is not burned.
[2024-08-14T21:12:44] GABE: 36v line has continuity but capacitor line doesnt, makes no sense, they are the same line.
[2024-08-14T21:13:22] GABE: Ah, it fried the internal metal lining
[2024-08-14T21:13:36] GABE: bud sent me 3 for free, so i dont have to fix this one.
[2024-08-14T21:13:45] GABE: i was just making sure i wasnt throwing out a working esc.
[2024-08-14T21:15:37] GABE: yeah, physics wont be as easy as electrical, ive forgotten the ordeal isnt over yet.
[2024-08-14T21:16:38] GABE: hah, who are they send to send physics equations to.

[2024-08-14T21:33:42] haku: buy tesla people. make the world a better place
[2024-08-14T21:33:44] Yamal: but does it pay something? sponsor?

[2024-08-14T21:35:10] 'lekrsu': elon os wen
[2024-08-14T21:35:21] Yamal: Have you ever been able to talk to him?
[2024-08-14T21:35:46] haku: no. i only pray to him
[2024-08-14T21:36:53] haku: his tesla gps is trash i have to admit
[2024-08-14T21:37:06] 'lekrsu': We need more ultra rich motivated people regardless of their products 👌
[2024-08-14T21:37:22] Yamal: What happens to you with Elon is what happens to me with the Viking of the northern lands BV
[2024-08-14T21:41:10] Yamal: It is a mutual feeling, but know that Elon is simply in the shadow of the king of kings and the lion of Judah
[2024-08-14T21:41:33] haku: tesla isnt for the rich in america. idk in other countries
[2024-08-14T21:41:44] haku: its a commuter electric vehicle
[2024-08-14T21:41:54] 'lekrsu': I mean founders xD
[2024-08-14T21:42:12] 'lekrsu': Teslas are relatively easy to finance, ppl take loans however.
[2024-08-14T21:42:19] 'lekrsu': Few buy outright.
[2024-08-14T21:50:25] Yamal: Have you ever tried El Rey's electronics?
[2024-08-14T21:52:16] haku: what the hell
[2024-08-14T21:53:32] Noname: Only 100 freedom units and they laugh at the price 😕
[2024-08-14T21:57:29] Yamal: I would love to see you release new/compact and powerful things for e-scooter, by the way the ubox are already being sold here in Spain with the mosfet changed to 100v which is exactly what you do, I was surprised when I remembered the conversation that took place a long time ago about the 500 controller, I don't remember its name with the box with bad cooling or something like that..😎😂
[2024-08-14T21:58:24] Yamal: making money is what really counts
[2024-08-14T22:00:31] Hackintoshhhh: That also goes for tronic 250r?
[2024-08-14T22:02:34] Yamal: The 250Rs do not work well at 100v,in fact, Tronic has removed them from their website.
[2024-08-14T22:06:57] Yamal: On the other hand, the x12 are a cake, they work very well, they are compact and powerful, we are waiting for a competitor to take them and be able to get the most out of them and give us their opinion and experience, all electronics deserve to be tested on a safe circuit. 1.5km straight test, it is not enough to determine the performance of the esc, you have to stretch it!!!
[2024-08-14T22:15:53] Yamal: I want too but 1$$$
[2024-08-14T22:18:01] Yamal: but there is hope, in fact why not try seven controller in the near future

[2024-08-15T00:24:12] Yamal: By the way, your red nami still lives, ? or you took off his clothes to pass him to the "thunder"xD
[2024-08-15T00:26:03] haku: has anyone here tested the str500 trampa. would be cool to see it in action
[2024-08-15T00:26:31] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: More or less alive, i take the brake to put on my Surron, and the C350 died, i already repaired it but i did not take motivation to assembly it again to the scooter, for the reste the Red Nami are complete, i used 0 Parts from the Nami to my SR-X
[2024-08-15T00:27:09] Yamal: Cool
[2024-08-15T00:30:59] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: i am confident of the X12, i ear that they push them to much more than 400A phase, but i suppose it should heat a lot because of the high rdsON, but i am curious to know the real capacity of that controller
[2024-08-15T00:31:06] haku: what surron is it?
[2024-08-15T00:31:19] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but the conception are totally new, not made by the same as the 250 one who was really a piece of shit
[2024-08-15T00:31:32] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Light Bee
[2024-08-15T00:32:10] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: C700, Sotion, 22S10P
[2024-08-15T00:32:43] haku: holy cow! thats awsome

[2024-08-15T00:34:55] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Yeah but i regret, it's too heavy for nothing, i looking for reducing that, Maybe 22S9P, 24 mos Vesc, like Torp 1000 more weight and compact for same performance, and motor i dont know, Sotion with higher KV, like TM25 or else
[2024-08-15T00:35:40] haku: what country are you from if you dont mind me asking?
[2024-08-15T00:37:05] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: i like evey vehicule who make me Fun, and i looking something else than "Patinette" "Escooter" because i am lazy by the community of morons, liars, scammers and stupid people found there, i hope it's better in Motorbike community, and for the moment it's true

[2024-08-15T00:41:36] Yamal: I think that if Vedder married a South Korean woman, it would give way to a cool community, like weped cafe but with vesc
[2024-08-15T00:42:23] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Hahaha, be careful south korean are buisness buisness, not friend
[2024-08-15T00:42:35] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: i think Vedder are the opposite of that
[2024-08-15T00:42:53] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: he make it by passion, and many other ppl take benefit of it (even me finally)
[2024-08-15T00:43:09] 'lekrsu': Vedder's married 👀
[2024-08-15T00:44:04] Yamal: vedder must now be living in a cave and making cave paintings like in Atapuerca

[2024-08-15T00:45:52] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: and they limit the evolution of vesc a lot i guess
[2024-08-15T00:46:04] Yamal: 😭
[2024-08-15T00:46:31] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: One exemple, the last one controller they sell after a years it's the STR500 who are a shit Design, and no-one buying it lol
[2024-08-15T00:47:24] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: They dont understand the market and they dont make interesting things, they still are in skateboard world and it's all
[2024-08-15T00:48:47] Yamal: what I don't understand. If some of you know so much about this, why don't you tell Vedder, man to man, without shame or trauma
[2024-08-15T00:52:02] Yamal: We do a campaign, instead of "freeing Willy" We call it "freeing Vedder"
[2024-08-15T01:00:08] haku: i was hoping thay str 500 would be a vesc alternative to fardriver and other big esc
[2024-08-15T01:01:09] haku: the vesc platform is just so good. too bad its not used in really high powered applications.
[2024-08-15T01:01:30] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: You have already other alternative, like 3Shul, Torp, EBMX and others i forget
[2024-08-15T01:02:14] haku: ebmx and torp can it be flashed to use vesc app?

[2024-08-15T01:08:28] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: All is possible with this joke cup

[2024-08-15T01:20:02] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: I use my compet scooter as a trash scooter to go in glocery store or else lol
[2024-08-15T01:22:45] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: And that's boring me because ppl ask me with entousiasm about my scooter, but i dont care myself so, i just want make a discrete and ugly scooter actually to be invisible
[2024-08-15T01:23:36] Yamal: That's something big, for me the stock scooters don't make sense when you get used to the high speed and good torque you don't want anything else.
[2024-08-15T01:24:35] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: i dont say origin scooter, i said ugly scooter, but with power inside

[2024-08-15T01:26:49] Yamal: That it is aesthetically beautiful, nothing happens, if they ask, they should ask the best It is always not to give speed data because it is typical. how much does it run? I always say the same thing 60kmh or something like that style
[2024-08-15T01:28:30] Yamal: The scooter in the times we live in has to always be by your side, that's clear! You can't even leave him chained and leave, that's how it is, they are very sweet.

[2024-08-15T15:34:07] GABE: Next time I'll definitely do 0.2.
[2024-08-15T15:34:15] GABE: Even at 4v it welds.
[2024-08-15T15:35:00] GABE: Literally 2p P42A equivalent
[2024-08-15T15:35:11] GABE: Well, P45B
[2024-08-15T15:36:02] Noname: Also short soldering station cable is very aggravating
[2024-08-15T15:36:13] haku: nickel should be enough for that.
[2024-08-15T15:37:13] haku: what cells are these?

[2024-08-15T15:38:54] GABE: I'm thinking to make the internal 10s, and the external I will charge with an RC charger.
[2024-08-15T15:38:57] GABE: unsure what is more clean.
[2024-08-15T15:39:26] GABE: I could transport the cell easier with 10s
[2024-08-15T15:39:28] haku: clean your copper is my opinion
[2024-08-15T15:39:55] GABE: It came like that haha i shouldve used the new copper. I'll change to it now

[2024-08-15T16:28:34] GABE: I'm using the stock one, unsure if another supply is safe even with same voltage.
[2024-08-15T16:31:52] Smart Repair: I have the same welding machine and the original power supply is rubbish. If I were you, I would attach a laboratory power supply to it and increase the current by 50%... Nothing will break.
[2024-08-15T16:32:20] GABE: I can find a supply, I have no laboratory supply.
[2024-08-15T16:32:31] GABE: It reuptakes faster yeah?

[2024-08-15T20:25:12] Yamal: In the Philippines there is a very strong Nami community, and they make routes of many many kilometers, but they would like to be on par with the Americans in terms of the routes of these countrymen.
[2024-08-15T20:26:35] haku: filipinos in america ride emotos

[2024-08-15T21:43:37] GABE: scooter language
[2024-08-15T21:45:20] GABE: Lol
[2024-08-15T21:47:06] GABE: its the concept of if mosfets will short when at a high temperature because the copper they are made of will expand
[2024-08-15T21:48:01] GABE: god forbid someone put mosfets that close, though

[2024-08-15T22:50:18] haku: the gray smaller g30 i kinda like
[2024-08-15T22:51:11] haku: the g30 l or whatever. the smaller frame one
[2024-08-15T22:51:25] Noname: I had a sharkset then another stock one and I didn't care. Fun to jump it over the bumps.
[2024-08-15T22:51:43] Noname: Lp
[2024-08-15T22:51:52] haku: that one
[2024-08-15T22:52:05] haku: you can fit 16s there i think
[2024-08-15T22:52:30] haku: dang. good to know
[2024-08-15T22:53:01] haku: that sucks
[2024-08-15T22:53:01] Noname: It's twitchy best cause it's short
[2024-08-15T22:53:42] haku: big g30 then. i have frame
[2024-08-15T22:55:49] Noname: Well it's less battery also and less foot room
[2024-08-15T22:55:51] haku: i failed elon with my bms wiring.
[2024-08-15T22:56:07] Noname: Lost your chance at space camp
[2024-08-15T22:56:15] haku: lol
[2024-08-15T22:56:35] Noname: Hey now obstacles get in the way
[2024-08-15T22:56:41] Noname: I can't say shit
[2024-08-15T22:56:43] haku: shaman said we cant storm the capitol on that.
[2024-08-15T22:58:26] haku: this is him.
[2024-08-15T22:58:40] Noname: That golf cart project died 8yrs ago
[2024-08-15T22:59:07] haku: so many vehicles in you garage
[2024-08-15T22:59:40] haku: agreed!
[2024-08-15T23:00:33] Noname: I built it and then moved nowhere to drive it
[2024-08-15T23:00:52] haku: thats awsome
[2024-08-15T23:00:58] Noname: Sold the red bike and green one needs a head gasket
[2024-08-15T23:01:23] haku: convert to electric.
[2024-08-15T23:01:40] Noname: That's my basement. I dint have a garage
[2024-08-15T23:01:51] Noname: It was originally lol
[2024-08-15T23:02:02] haku: wtf how did you get it down there.
[2024-08-15T23:02:32] Noname: Took cab off flipped sideways and a winch to the lolly column through door
[2024-08-15T23:03:37] haku: that yellow golf cart yea?
[2024-08-15T23:03:48] Noname: I'm broke because I have projects but have equity
[2024-08-15T23:03:52] haku: i would drive that around the hood
[2024-08-15T23:04:30] haku: you living the american dream dude.
[2024-08-15T23:04:59] haku: you can weld too.
[2024-08-15T23:06:11] Noname: Bought it like this
[2024-08-15T23:06:38] Noname: Got to this point and it died out. 200sx atv motor with a Ford 9" factory rear end. Have hydro steering from a Kubota mower left and it could drive again
[2024-08-15T23:07:19] Noname: Yeah. Can do lots just being poor holds me back. Paying for a house is a killer
[2024-08-15T23:08:03] Noname: Only reason I need a wife. Pay half and go away 😆 ill be in the garage
[2024-08-15T23:08:04] haku: this is the ultimate end of days transportation
[2024-08-15T23:08:48] Noname: No not doing the mad max lifestyle
[2024-08-15T23:09:35] Noname: Well now they import kei trucks so legal road riding took the wind out of my sail
[2024-08-15T23:09:40] haku: you can prolly fit a whole tesla battery console on that bed
[2024-08-15T23:09:54] 'lekrsu': Best place for a zombie apocalypse would be the Korean battery factories. Energy, covered! Bombs, covered!
[2024-08-15T23:09:57] Noname: Yeah easy
[2024-08-15T23:10:26] Noname: Ain't dealing with zombies either
[2024-08-15T23:10:39] 'lekrsu': yet
[2024-08-15T23:10:53] Noname: I. Mean when they come
[2024-08-15T23:11:08] haku: i need you in my team. i need a welder. james can fix electronics. ill do the heavy lifting
[2024-08-15T23:11:41] haku: i need someone that knows how to fly drones too
[2024-08-15T23:12:27] Forol1561: WHERE?!
[2024-08-15T23:13:12] Noname: I can fly drones
[2024-08-15T23:13:21] haku: your in!
[2024-08-15T23:13:35] haku: when it happens we meet in vegas
[2024-08-15T23:14:01] Noname: Were the E-Team? Like A-Team but new age shit
[2024-08-15T23:14:20] Noname: <animation>
[2024-08-15T23:14:37] haku: we need @Gabzy_x as cannon fodder too
[2024-08-15T23:14:58] Forol1561: I can do it a lot better🗿
[2024-08-15T23:15:09] haku: your also in
[2024-08-15T23:15:16] Forol1561: ?

[2024-08-15T23:27:00] GABE: Only 3 V2 forks left in available existence..
[2024-08-15T23:27:09] GABE: so you should grab one for your rear soon..
[2024-08-15T23:27:25] GABE: will probably be sold out in less than a week
[2024-08-15T23:27:59] Hackintoshhhh: Wait u have 3 more speedfork sets?
[2024-08-15T23:28:16] Hackintoshhhh: I will need to, incase the pigs impound my scoot
[2024-08-15T23:28:34] GABE: Last 3 on earth to be sold.
[2024-08-15T23:28:40] GABE: no more
[2024-08-15T23:28:43] GABE: anywhere ever
[2024-08-15T23:28:52] Hackintoshhhh: I need one more set just in case
[2024-08-15T23:28:56] GABE: I think everyone who is using them will never sell them.
[2024-08-15T23:29:09] GABE: Yeah you should nab 2 off him imminently
[2024-08-15T23:29:19] GABE: or whatever
[2024-08-15T23:29:33] Hackintoshhhh: I may have money but not that much
[2024-08-15T23:29:43] Hackintoshhhh: One set for my friend, other set for me
[2024-08-15T23:32:37] haku: i will buy the leftovers if theres any. money is funny right now
[2024-08-15T23:35:28] Noname: Think we're getting a Lazer cnc cutter thing at work. Just make some 4 u
[2024-08-15T23:38:06] Noname: We will start "Tiku" company selling cheap knock offs

[2024-08-15T23:56:28] haku: arent you jamaican and indian?
[2024-08-15T23:56:48] haku: i might need you on my team
[2024-08-15T23:57:07] Yamal: team benjamin vedder with the mission to free willy
[2024-08-15T23:57:54] Yamal: count on me!
[2024-08-15T23:58:15] Yamal: Spain conexion free lands
[2024-08-15T23:59:20] haku: you also know plants and farming. thats a bonus

[2024-08-16T00:03:18] Yamal: I am not Jamaican
[2024-08-16T00:03:55] haku: my bad. you like to post those jamaican songs. i thought you were
[2024-08-16T00:04:13] haku: raggae
[2024-08-16T00:05:32] Yamal: I am Spanish 100x100, what happens is that here we are all very mixed, everyone who has passed has been giving, but Persians, Arabs, Vikings, Romans have passed through here..
[2024-08-16T00:05:45] Yamal: I like the music xD

[2024-08-16T01:09:49] haku: those single fork axle motors how does that work?
[2024-08-16T01:15:33] Yamal: Apparently good, and it is stable but the truth is that 2 swingarms instead of 1 always give more confidence
[2024-08-16T01:16:43] haku: gadam not harley davidson! they went woke
[2024-08-16T01:17:10] Noname: My issue is the short distance between bearings. More so if ball bearings, my vsett 10 was a sloppy pos.

[2024-08-16T01:56:37] cihan: https://youtu.be/3tvygy0iqqI?si=-Vm7U9iSkbtwx27e This can be the reason why your Glitter 811H burned mosfet. They keep increasing mosfet count and also use higher current mosfet among similar models but capacitors remain the same. I'm not sure if capacitor could be insufficient and cause mosfets burn but this happens often with battery sourced spot welders. @Bradhaku
[2024-08-16T01:57:55] cihan: By the way channel has nice explanatory videos.
[2024-08-16T01:58:17] haku: capacitors on 811h are huge. like coke cans.
[2024-08-16T01:59:10] cihan: That's nice to know. 801D and 801H share same capacitors but 801H has twice current or more.
[2024-08-16T01:59:29] haku: nice!
[2024-08-16T01:59:42] haku: 801h is new i think.
[2024-08-16T02:00:30] haku: i did not see that option before
[2024-08-16T02:00:31] cihan: Probably, there's no latter number than H in 801 series.
[2024-08-16T02:00:47] cihan: If that makes sense
[2024-08-16T02:02:40] haku: <video_file>
[2024-08-16T02:03:12] haku: they even made a video because im sure im not the only one
[2024-08-16T02:05:33] cihan: I'm searching for a cheap spot welder with 10 or more IRL40SC228 or IRL40SC209 mosfets now. I'm not sure if having 10 of those mosfets make sense since car battery will probably not be able to supply enough current for them. IRL40SC228 is 557A silicone limited and 360A wire bond limited.
[2024-08-16T02:06:27] haku: im not much of a spot welder expert. but do not buy 811h.
[2024-08-16T02:07:08] Paolo ⁭: Doesn't exist sry
[2024-08-16T02:07:14] Paolo ⁭: Only way is diy
[2024-08-16T02:07:34] cihan: It's probably necessary but unacceptable for a top model with a high price. I'd find it acceptable if it costed 150 USD or less.
[2024-08-16T02:08:17] haku: atleast they were decent enough to supply me replacement parts and this video lol
[2024-08-16T02:08:44] cihan: Did they send you replacement parts free of charge?
[2024-08-16T02:09:13] Paolo ⁭: I agree, is very riskful
[2024-08-16T02:09:27] haku: yes. only paid $10 for shipping. they sent me every pcb but the capacitors
[2024-08-16T02:09:29] Paolo ⁭: Video da parte di Stop
[2024-08-16T02:09:46] Paolo ⁭: Welder off status, and acting as rod welder
[2024-08-16T02:09:47] cihan: I'll probably seek DIY. Do you have an idea how much current can a 60A car battery supply for such short welding durations and at 10V or above?
[2024-08-16T02:09:58] haku: aye caramba! thats crazy
[2024-08-16T02:10:15] Paolo ⁭: I don't recommend car batteries for weldijg
[2024-08-16T02:10:54] haku: what about transformer diy?
[2024-08-16T02:11:05] cihan: That's still not bad, they support their product.
[2024-08-16T02:11:46] cihan: So lipo only if not lead acid and not super capacitor?
[2024-08-16T02:11:49] Paolo ⁭: Car battery isn't truck battery
[2024-08-16T02:11:52] haku: i asked new capacitors assembly. they would not send it. they said every excuse not to
[2024-08-16T02:12:09] Paolo ⁭: 60Ah around you got 750a pulse
[2024-08-16T02:12:15] Paolo ⁭: With one of best brand
[2024-08-16T02:12:17] cihan: 240Ah 12V?
[2024-08-16T02:13:22] Paolo ⁭: Capacitor and kweld aren't friends
[2024-08-16T02:13:27] cihan: Strange, Glitter would probably have a much higher brand value for me if they did.
[2024-08-16T02:13:42] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2024-08-16T02:14:08] Paolo ⁭: Only way is put shit Chinese capacitors or use 14awg for welding😂
[2024-08-16T02:14:15] cihan: Do you have an idea about voltage of the battery when you draw 1300A impulse?
[2024-08-16T02:14:19] haku: im sure when they refine thier product it will be a really good welder. but china will always cut costs
[2024-08-16T02:14:25] Paolo ⁭: There's no way, you can put fake cable length but there's limit
[2024-08-16T02:14:38] Paolo ⁭: And they don't want to provide no limit firmwsre
[2024-08-16T02:14:55] cihan: Are Chinese capacitors that bad?)
[2024-08-16T02:17:06] Paolo ⁭: I see the datasheet, max current 2800A, you will got over current I think haha
[2024-08-16T02:17:18] haku: is low voltage better? by low you mean 6v?
[2024-08-16T02:17:52] Paolo ⁭: Bro is contrary, you have more welding current with high voltage than low voltage
[2024-08-16T02:18:40] haku: i did not know you can run kweld at that voltage. i really thought its fixed 12v
[2024-08-16T02:18:54] haku: good info
[2024-08-16T02:19:20] Paolo ⁭: Device don't even turn on at this voltage I think
[2024-08-16T02:20:10] Paolo ⁭: What losses? Overall losses or the current which will deliver on the welding tip?
[2024-08-16T02:20:21] haku: kweld pro. i see you being the testers
[2024-08-16T02:27:08] cihan: Not only battery, there is also more silicone power loss too.
[2024-08-16T02:27:53] haku: i shouldve went with kweld.
[2024-08-16T02:33:43] Paolo ⁭: I agree with everything, but the problem is the current which is passing throught the weld point, not the circuit. As it have to heat more possible a high voltage help to pass more current
[2024-08-16T02:34:03] Paolo ⁭: I mean 12v is perfect 😅
[2024-08-16T02:34:10] cihan: What are the mosfets on kweld?
[2024-08-16T02:34:35] Paolo ⁭: Don't focus on MOSFET, it's not a problem
[2024-08-16T02:35:56] cihan: V=I*R works everywhere. You can use any source voltage but voltage at contact will be lower.
[2024-08-16T02:36:06] Paolo ⁭: Btw himself made a capacitor module with 6s1p configuration instead of 3s2p
[2024-08-16T02:36:13] Paolo ⁭: Ok bro
[2024-08-16T02:37:06] Paolo ⁭: Mosfet doesn't even feel the heat if is under 60c lol
[2024-08-16T02:37:32] cihan: Higher quality mosfet with low Rds and high current heats less and allows more current, harder to burn. But I don't know how I can power it sufficiently and cheap.)
[2024-08-16T02:37:44] Paolo ⁭: Never happen, I welded like crazy with kweld
[2024-08-16T02:38:15] Paolo ⁭: Maybe you use box? I don't use box
[2024-08-16T02:39:22] Paolo ⁭: I mean on kweld, the current limit don't allow you to put load which it can't handle
[2024-08-16T02:40:15] Paolo ⁭: Xt150 don't have very good space for cable soldering
[2024-08-16T02:40:21] Paolo ⁭: Get qs8/ec8
[2024-08-16T02:42:29] Paolo ⁭: Better cable make you trigger overcurrent😂
[2024-08-16T02:42:48] Paolo ⁭: They suggest you to put thinner cable , what a joke lol
[2024-08-16T02:43:16] Paolo ⁭: Ah ofc, I use 25mm2 cable
[2024-08-16T02:43:57] Paolo ⁭: With Tig there's 0 heat, 0 loss
[2024-08-16T02:44:12] Paolo ⁭: Changed my life really
[2024-08-16T02:44:36] Paolo ⁭: Get a timer board on ali (30$) and cheap Tig (100$)
[2024-08-16T02:44:52] Paolo ⁭: You've all the necessary
[2024-08-16T02:46:14] cihan: Somehow you're using really high current. There's a current measuring tool the Russian guy used on spot welder reviews. Have you ever measured it? Somehow you use really high current or your cables have such a high resistance that most of the energy is spent on not the welding surface but on your cables.
[2024-08-16T02:47:16] cihan: I have seen some TIG welders about 300 USD. They're not more expensive than a good spot welder setup.
[2024-08-16T02:47:37] Paolo ⁭: Bro you still didn't understand the problem, if you put a bigger cable the overcurrent error will be triggered
[2024-08-16T02:47:52] Paolo ⁭: We know perfectly that much power is loss on the cables
[2024-08-16T02:48:28] cihan: What's the allowed max current for Kweld?
[2024-08-16T02:48:37] Forol1561: kay.... the shocks choice is pretty narrower now..... just need to know what LBS to get on the G2
[2024-08-16T02:48:37] haku: ill get a tig welder. ill meet you in the shadow realm with that one guy @PaoloWu
[2024-08-16T02:49:11] Forol1561: (I weigh like 60kg)
[2024-08-16T02:50:48] cihan: Somehow spot welder circuit has to adjust that current and time , that's why we use it. Otherwise you'll have to use different resistance cables for different tasks or will have to add a series resistance to a very thick cable.
[2024-08-16T02:51:20] Paolo ⁭: 2000
[2024-08-16T02:52:05] Paolo ⁭: I was very disappointed when I got 6s1p 3000f Maxwell pack, overcurrent error , wasted time
[2024-08-16T02:52:47] Lisa: @ESt1ft
[2024-08-16T02:52:56] cihan: It's not that big. 80 USD Chinese docreate capacitor welder can do 1700A. I cannot buy it, that's another story. :(
[2024-08-16T02:52:56] Lisa: Für dein 20s3p 😂😭
[2024-08-16T02:53:24] Paolo ⁭: Yes , I tried with 8v as well
[2024-08-16T02:55:30] cihan: Kweld is probably nice but seems a little overrated to me. Especially after I learned those Infoneon mosfets can pass 300A.
[2024-08-16T02:55:42] Paolo ⁭: https://a.aliexpress.com/_m0Xw25A
[2024-08-16T02:55:48] Paolo ⁭: I think this works better
[2024-08-16T02:57:16] cihan: It will work pretty well if those mosfets are low resistance. I wish they were all IRL40SC228.
[2024-08-16T02:57:48] cihan: Where do you buy good quality capacitors?
[2024-08-16T02:58:03] Paolo ⁭: Many of these cheap spot welder uses fake chips
[2024-08-16T02:58:15] Paolo ⁭: But as it works as original one who cares lol
[2024-08-16T02:59:03] Paolo ⁭: Tme.eu of mouser
[2024-08-16T02:59:25] cihan: They're good as long as mosfets are good and powered properly.
[2024-08-16T03:01:42] cihan: 😢 Mouser is great place as long as they ship to you. Mouser prices for Meanwell power supplies were cheaper than cheapest price for same power supply in Turkey.
[2024-08-16T03:04:53] haku: whats mouser
[2024-08-16T03:06:06] cihan: One of the biggest retail electronics seller
[2024-08-16T03:08:18] haku: ill check it out. straight off china?
[2024-08-16T03:08:25] cihan: Probably. I didn't read or watch a detailed review of it knowing I won't be able to buy.
[2024-08-16T03:09:12] Forol1561: anyone got an idea?
[2024-08-16T03:09:29] Noname: That Lil stuff what's that data cable from the tele company?
[2024-08-16T03:09:38] cihan: It's a US company. It sells almost all semiconductors from every manufacturer.
[2024-08-16T03:10:20] haku: thats good to know. thanks for the info. im noob at chips and electronics
[2024-08-16T03:11:10] haku: maybe possible turn spintend to 150v with changing some stuff
[2024-08-16T03:11:43] cihan: Mouser, Digikey and Farnell are all good and big
[2024-08-16T03:12:19] cihan: I'm not sure. Probably mosfets won't allow it.
[2024-08-16T03:13:14] Noname: You competing for biggest hole in pc board?
[2024-08-16T03:13:51] cihan: I just wondered and Googled it, there are 4500V mosfets.))

[2024-08-16T20:23:33] GABE: i wish it were just one
[2024-08-16T20:24:10] GABE: ill get 60kmh cont
[2024-08-16T20:24:21] GABE: well 50 without fwk and fuck fwk or this 250 will so burn
[2024-08-16T20:24:35] haku: can you do fwk on xiaomi esc?
[2024-08-16T20:24:42] GABE: yes and its very good.
[2024-08-16T20:24:50] GABE: it makes it so fast lol
[2024-08-16T20:24:54] haku: oh nice.
[2024-08-16T20:24:57] GABE: xiaomi fwk is faster than vesc
[2024-08-16T20:25:10] haku: ok.
[2024-08-16T20:25:17] GABE: idk why
[2024-08-16T20:25:21] GABE: leksru would know
[2024-08-16T20:25:37] haku: what is max voltage and amps on xiomi.esc?
[2024-08-16T20:25:49] GABE: 13s pro 2 will rip tho fr after months of no scoot
[2024-08-16T20:26:07] GABE: you can do 20s and have no issues if you dont use fwk.
[2024-08-16T20:26:19] GABE: 13s is max for stock
[2024-08-16T20:26:26] GABE: you have to change resistors etc for more
[2024-08-16T20:26:29] haku: word. thats crazy. how much amps?
[2024-08-16T20:26:32] GABE: not alot.
[2024-08-16T20:26:43] GABE: But enough for a 250w
[2024-08-16T20:26:49] GABE: even 800w is ok with it actually 40-50a ish
[2024-08-16T20:27:10] haku: xiaomi esc is the same as g30?
[2024-08-16T20:27:24] GABE: G30 esc has better build quality
[2024-08-16T20:27:30] GABE: but like its still xiaomi shit tho lol
[2024-08-16T20:28:49] haku: do you flash the xiaomi esc?
[2024-08-16T20:29:08] haku: or you can access it via app
[2024-08-16T20:30:18] 'lekrsu': I've not explored fwk on vesc a lot. I find it cringe.
[2024-08-16T20:30:31] 'lekrsu': Without is superior
[2024-08-16T20:31:31] haku: so many people saying fwk os not really neccesary
[2024-08-16T20:31:37] 'lekrsu': Xiaomi's and G30's can be easily killed by improper fwk use.
[2024-08-16T20:31:51] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <photos/photo_16883@16-08-2024_20-31-51.jpg>
[2024-08-16T20:32:01] 'lekrsu': Going 50kmh when w/o fwk does 30 isn't logical. So inefficient.
[2024-08-16T20:33:08] 'lekrsu': VESCs impl is based on ramp up time and duty. SHFW & XDFW does speed based fwk increase with approximated limits based on MCU timers giving voltage time.
[2024-08-16T20:33:22] haku: if you have big dick battery vesc and motor do you still need fwk?
[2024-08-16T20:33:30] 'lekrsu': No
[2024-08-16T20:33:47] Forol1561: anyone know the stifness of the stock g2 "dampener" springs? (back suspension)
[2024-08-16T20:33:47] 'lekrsu': Fwk kills hardware if it turns off from overcurrent.
[2024-08-16T20:34:18] 'lekrsu': Vesc & xesc alike. Somehow the G30 esc I gave away survived bms cut-off at 160kmh.
[2024-08-16T20:34:34] 'lekrsu': Meanwhile a freaking 36v unmodified esc died for no reason
[2024-08-16T20:34:46] haku: so fwk is only for that extra boost.
[2024-08-16T20:34:55] GABE: Non vesc on everything is better
[2024-08-16T20:35:09] GABE: fwk drains the cells so much for fuck all more speed.
[2024-08-16T20:35:17] haku: what?
[2024-08-16T20:35:24] GABE: Like I mean no fwk
[2024-08-16T20:35:31] Paolo ⁭: Not true
[2024-08-16T20:36:03] 'lekrsu': What does this sentence mean
[2024-08-16T20:36:03] haku: preach the vesc gospel mr paulo.
[2024-08-16T20:36:20] 'lekrsu': No just something that happened last week randomly
[2024-08-16T20:36:25] 'lekrsu': Never seen that before
[2024-08-16T20:36:35] 'lekrsu': 3.3v died
[2024-08-16T20:36:36] GABE: I'm so stoned
[2024-08-16T20:36:40] GABE: I said the wrong thing
[2024-08-16T20:36:56] Forol1561: AYO
[2024-08-16T20:36:57] GABE: Without fwk is beetter
[2024-08-16T20:37:05] 'lekrsu': Of course
[2024-08-16T20:37:07] Paolo ⁭: Probably your ESC is not very good
[2024-08-16T20:37:11] haku: if was was admin you banned right away for saying vesc is inferior. lucky im not a lord
[2024-08-16T20:37:15] 'lekrsu': AT32 G30 esc sucks.
[2024-08-16T20:37:33] GABE: Fuck all heat on baby motors if no fwk is used
[2024-08-16T20:37:36] GABE: Even at 20s
[2024-08-16T20:37:46] GABE: Just cruising at 50 it never heats
[2024-08-16T20:37:48] Finn: <photos/photo_16884@16-08-2024_20-37-48.jpg>
[2024-08-16T20:37:52] Finn: Lets go for a ride
[2024-08-16T20:38:14] haku: nice. where the motor?
[2024-08-16T20:38:33] 'lekrsu': Now, since I was ignored in the other group, how tight is these supposed to be set on Monorim?
[2024-08-16T20:38:33] 'lekrsu': Spacers here though? Going without. How freely should they move?
[2024-08-16T20:38:45] Finn: Front😂
[2024-08-16T20:39:07] Finn: Huh?
[2024-08-16T20:39:22] haku: that is stealthy.
[2024-08-16T20:40:20] Mirono escooters: Guys, it's going offtopic, hard
[2024-08-16T20:40:49] Paolo ⁭: Is good now?
[2024-08-16T20:46:47] haku: to be clear and staying on topic. vesc is a white mans creation. not some chinamans okay @Gabzy_x. thats why its better
[2024-08-16T20:52:47] Patrick: You lie
[2024-08-16T20:52:52] Patrick: 32E
[2024-08-16T20:53:06] Lisa: Bro what haha
[2024-08-16T20:53:18] Patrick: Nothing wrong with it
[2024-08-16T20:53:23] Lisa: How do you know I lie?
[2024-08-16T20:53:28] Patrick: Sncs
[2024-08-16T20:53:29] Lisa: Did I say so?
[2024-08-16T20:53:34] Patrick: Ebay verkäufe
[2024-08-16T20:53:39] Lisa: What’s that?
[2024-08-16T20:53:48] Patrick: Isolierband wrap
[2024-08-16T20:53:53] Lisa: @Mirono_escooters he speaks German idk please punish him hard type shit
[2024-08-16T20:54:02] Lisa: What’s that?

[2024-08-16T20:54:32] Mirono escooters: Chill
[2024-08-16T20:54:55] Lisa: I know he’s the bad guy here 😳😱
[2024-08-16T20:55:07] Mirono escooters: Idk, someone here pulled out of a deal tho
[2024-08-16T20:55:18] Mirono escooters: So, English, yes, but not warning worthy
[2024-08-16T20:55:35] Mirono escooters: Next time is
[2024-08-16T20:56:03] Lisa: Thx he did it to me too haha
[2024-08-16T20:57:00] Patrick: Building and selling batterys and then asking me how to connect a switch💀
[2024-08-16T20:57:11] Patrick: I still got the screenshots
[2024-08-16T20:57:25] Mirono escooters: Hey, if there's proof, we'd love to see it But don't talk air
[2024-08-16T20:57:42] Lisa: I ain’t selling battery’s no more
[2024-08-16T20:57:50] Mirono escooters: So much loving in this world
[2024-08-16T20:58:02] Lisa: We playing often warzone haha
[2024-08-16T20:58:20] Lisa: So hahaha idk we just need to punish
[2024-08-16T21:01:07] Patrick: And this guy sold batterys
[2024-08-16T21:01:08] Patrick: <photos/photo_16887@16-08-2024_21-01-08.jpg>
[2024-08-16T21:02:07] Lisa: I don’t understand this
[2024-08-16T21:02:11] Lisa: What especially is this?
[2024-08-16T21:02:16] Lisa: Can you please explain?
[2024-08-16T21:03:24] Patrick: Youre lucky that i deleated the screenshots of the 20s3p with 32E you sold to youre customer with the g30 with a incorrectly wired BMS
[2024-08-16T21:03:38] Lisa: Hmm what you mean?
[2024-08-16T21:03:46] Lisa: I only sell battery’s from Hans Albert
[2024-08-16T21:03:54] Lisa: Tg Name
[2024-08-16T21:03:56] GABE: will be funny tho when i have a 80250 in it at some point
[2024-08-16T21:03:57] Mirono escooters: Omg
[2024-08-16T21:04:05] Mirono escooters: Reseller? XD
[2024-08-16T21:04:14] Patrick: Yea looks like a premade one
[2024-08-16T21:04:14] Lisa: Yes I did and I say my error and paid Hans Albert to do my job
[2024-08-16T21:04:25] Patrick: I printed you the Cellholder for this one
[2024-08-16T21:04:47] Lisa: Never finished this pack I believe
[2024-08-16T21:04:59] Lisa: <photos/photo_16889@16-08-2024_21-04-59.jpg>
[2024-08-16T21:05:10] Lisa: As I said I no longer build battery’s
[2024-08-16T21:05:15] Patrick: Because you fucked the 20s3p
[2024-08-16T21:05:37] Lisa: Yes and I say my error? I don’t see the problem. I came up to my errors
[2024-08-16T21:05:53] Lisa: I don’t have the proper equipment and now I just don’t build them anymore
[2024-08-16T21:06:36] Patrick: Only after the customer with the G30 fucked you
[2024-08-16T21:07:40] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Now you can use it, there are some errors but nothing serious
[2024-08-16T21:08:40] Lisa: As I just stated, I say my error quit all my building projects and now I pay a guy.

[2024-08-16T21:24:59] haku: is it better to weld parralel first or series?
[2024-08-16T21:25:14] haku: or doesnt matter?
[2024-08-16T21:28:07] Lisa: Firstly S because there are the most A passing trough
[2024-08-16T21:28:31] haku: i do series first just because less sharp objects sticking out
[2024-08-16T21:37:12] Mirono escooters: Why not premade nickel
[2024-08-16T21:37:17] Mirono escooters: I cba to cut all them tiny pcs
[2024-08-16T21:37:41] haku: expensive.
[2024-08-16T21:38:10] haku: it looks more pro though
[2024-08-16T21:56:13] Mirono escooters: It's SO MUCH FASTER
[2024-08-16T21:56:30] Mirono escooters: It's not even a question if I buy it. The time saved justifies the little extra cost
[2024-08-16T21:56:41] Mirono escooters: Ignoring the lower risk of nickel welds failing
[2024-08-16T21:58:36] haku: ill get some but i have too many rolls of .1 .15 .2 nickel and nickel steel. i use them first. im not selling my stuff. for personal use
[2024-08-16T21:59:31] haku: idk why i bought so many rolls. i had to experiment whats best for .2 copper too
[2024-08-16T22:00:02] haku: i also have .3 pure nickel lol
[2024-08-16T22:02:32] 'lekrsu': Yes, Gabe told me they had to be on the inside
[2024-08-16T22:04:10] haku: is this ai or real but edited colors. i cant even tell anymore.
[2024-08-16T22:10:17] haku: nice.
[2024-08-16T22:10:51] haku: how many cm is the width for those?
[2024-08-16T22:11:31] haku: might be easier to get copper like this too.
[2024-08-16T22:22:01] Finn: Its a vesc discussion lol

[2024-08-17T01:09:20] haku: there are no xiaomis in the US ive looked everywhere. only clones

[2024-08-17T01:10:33] haku: a small portable scooter
[2024-08-17T01:15:48] Yamal: Why not g30
[2024-08-17T01:16:16] Yamal: a little more robust, with the possibility of putting larger engines in it
[2024-08-17T01:21:32] haku: i have one already (frame). smaller might be better.
[2024-08-17T01:22:41] haku: g30lp or xiaomi. same size i think
[2024-08-17T01:26:45] haku: i wont ride fast anyways. need a scoot to pick up my boy from school to school parking lot. 😂

[2024-08-17T02:06:02] Yamal: I say about the grapes at 12 bells,, Do you eat salty rice for your land at the end of the year?
[2024-08-17T02:06:49] Yamal: 🦃 maybe
[2024-08-17T02:07:04] haku: salt and rice is poor mans food in 3rd world country. thats what i eat.
[2024-08-17T02:07:29] haku: maybe add some eggs if i get lucky.
[2024-08-17T02:07:57] Yamal: Rice is a very good carbohydrate!
[2024-08-17T02:08:14] haku: gets me thru the day.

[2024-08-17T02:09:23] haku: no jasmine rice for me
[2024-08-17T02:10:08] Yamal: In Spain, round rice is typical, especially for paellas.
[2024-08-17T02:10:52] Yamal: In Mauritania I was eating broken rice and palm oil for a long timexD
[2024-08-17T02:10:52] haku: oh yea. same in pacific countries.
[2024-08-17T02:11:25] haku: im talkimg about dirty rice. the stuff you have to wash 5 times
[2024-08-17T02:11:28] Yamal: Basmati 👑
[2024-08-17T02:11:52] haku: there might or might not be any dead bugs.
[2024-08-17T02:13:35] haku: rice really good stuff if bulking though. its clean carbs
[2024-08-17T02:13:49] Yamal: here there is a culture of bread, not rice, unfortunately,,, Asia is another story, rice even for breakfast
[2024-08-17T02:14:47] Yamal: Baked potatoes and sweet potatoes are good carbohydrates too.
[2024-08-17T02:16:03] haku: sweet potato yes. very good stuff
[2024-08-17T02:16:13] Yamal: The topic of diet and nutrition has been going on for a while. how to open a new off topic channel
[2024-08-17T02:17:25] haku: i dont dare go to general chat. miro is watching me
[2024-08-17T02:17:47] Yamal: Here is a saying that says breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dinner like a beggar.
[2024-08-17T02:17:54] haku: i might get the hammer
[2024-08-17T02:18:33] haku: thats good though. you really have to limit your food intake at night.
[2024-08-17T02:19:03] haku: metabolism slows down when sleeping
[2024-08-17T02:19:26] Yamal: foods with casein protein ideal for night ,)
[2024-08-17T02:19:48] haku: any protien is good. cassien just absorbs slower.
[2024-08-17T02:20:18] haku: goat cheese and greek yogurt is the same thing
[2024-08-17T02:20:32] Yamal: clear so that the gorilla slowly assimilates
[2024-08-17T02:20:52] Yamal: cottage cheese
[2024-08-17T02:21:22] haku: thats same i think.
[2024-08-17T02:22:09] Yamal: You can also drink a shake with casein protein
[2024-08-17T02:22:24] Yamal: but if you don't train so that...
[2024-08-17T02:24:00] Yamal: In general and of great importance is that 90% of people do not take the necessary protein daily.
[2024-08-17T02:24:44] Yamal: one gram per kilo of weight for normal people
[2024-08-17T02:25:02] haku: they get it with american diet but it also comes with alot of other stuff lol
[2024-08-17T02:27:05] Yamal: Eggs, chicken and tuna, I would say that is what I consume the most now.
[2024-08-17T02:27:44] Yamal: I also have something, which we call nuclear mixture.
[2024-08-17T02:27:59] haku: this i use to buy but i stoped due to inflation. it like doubled in price.
[2024-08-17T02:28:14] Yamal: Good
[2024-08-17T02:28:15] haku: ill just buy eggs. same thing
[2024-08-17T02:28:59] haku: im not cutting anyway. forever bulk
[2024-08-17T02:33:20] haku: no red meat.
[2024-08-17T02:33:48] Yamal: Yes
[2024-08-17T02:34:44] haku: thats good you eat clean man.
[2024-08-17T02:35:09] Yamal: turkey too, rabbit, lamb I am 100x100. carniboro since I was born but I was referring to what I consume the most lately...
[2024-08-17T02:35:15] haku: i cant avoid junk food nowadays. specially candy
[2024-08-17T02:35:44] haku: no discipline
[2024-08-17T02:36:09] Yamal: to me the I like it sweet, but I'm undoubtedly more salty.
[2024-08-17T02:36:09] haku: i rock the dad bod.
[2024-08-17T02:37:08] haku: anyways. elon is good always
[2024-08-17T02:37:45] Yamal: and what I said before the nuclear mixture is a scrambled eggs (liver, heart, kidneys, lungs and bull's eggs) xD cut into small cubes and grilled
[2024-08-17T02:38:13] haku: dam wow!
[2024-08-17T02:38:39] haku: thats badass

[2024-08-17T02:39:10] Yamal: Last day I just take picture xD
[2024-08-17T02:39:35] Yamal: everything but without the lungs
[2024-08-17T02:39:45] haku: thats some natural testostorone booster
[2024-08-17T02:40:08] haku: liver is really good ive read.
[2024-08-17T02:40:25] Yamal: Livers have a lot of iron and are also a recipe for many people with anemia.
[2024-08-17T02:41:00] haku: dam you eat really clean
[2024-08-17T02:41:19] haku: they call that caveman diet i think here
[2024-08-17T02:43:54] haku: here beef organs are expensive. like delicacy.
[2024-08-17T02:44:59] Yamal: Mediterranean diet, I don't know here you eat a little bit of everything,, Now that I'm alone and I'm too lazy to cook, I eat during the meal. week based on salads with egg or tuna, and I want to start adding boiled legumes and a little faster, simpler, and if you don’t train, fill the green belly is good
[2024-08-17T02:52:57] haku: nice
[2024-08-17T02:58:29] Noname: To summerize everyone is broke and hungry here but we still buy scooter parts somehow. We're all the same 😆
[2024-08-17T03:18:13] Yamal: Let's see when my vacation comes, it will be more in Autumn
[2024-08-17T03:31:02] haku: dont forget the ebt and food stamps cant buy scooter parts
[2024-08-17T03:40:02] Noname: Damn. You can live in my shed for cheap rent. I'll give you extension cord and water hose
[2024-08-17T03:47:26] haku: you have access to gas? im cool with wood to keep me warm
[2024-08-17T03:47:56] haku: need 2 beds one for me and my boy
[2024-08-17T03:48:20] haku: is your house pet friendly?
[2024-08-17T03:54:50] Noname: I said shed
[2024-08-17T03:55:31] Noname: Need a renters agreement 🤝 fucker will try snuggling up in my bed
[2024-08-17T04:01:30] haku: i thought rent free. immigrants need a free place to stay
[2024-08-17T04:01:59] haku: minibike
[2024-08-17T04:02:08] haku: surron boys are here too
[2024-08-17T04:02:22] haku: and the gt2 spectrum guy
[2024-08-17T04:02:27] Noname: I don't even have a functioning kitchen
[2024-08-17T04:03:17] haku: <photos/photo_16902@17-08-2024_04-03-17.jpg>
[2024-08-17T04:03:30] haku: they are in the background
[2024-08-17T04:04:37] Noname: Those houses really 12ft apart?
[2024-08-17T04:05:48] haku: yep. no privacy
[2024-08-17T04:05:55] Noname: OK new plan we live in James's mop closet and build batterys 16hrs a day for a bowl of slop and a water
[2024-08-17T04:06:17] haku: good idea.
[2024-08-17T04:06:30] haku: my dog can use some snow
[2024-08-17T04:07:03] Noname: He'd flip out I bet, it's in his DNA
[2024-08-17T04:08:48] Noname: Buddy has a Chesapeake retriever only came in to eat and would cry to go out. Just slept in the snow, dog would not stop like 24hr energy
[2024-08-17T04:09:56] Noname: I love the time laps videos of snow dogs getting buried just chilling out on the porch
[2024-08-17T04:11:12] haku: yea. the dog i have is prolly the same. they are sled dogs in siberia or something
[2024-08-17T04:11:46] haku: thats why i have to run him on a scooter. to get all energy out
[2024-08-17T04:15:24] Noname: This is a retriever. He tried to get a bottle that was a marker for a rock in a lake. It was tied but thought he was making progress. Fucker almost drown he wouldn't stop.
[2024-08-17T04:16:05] haku: they good swimmers though. they have webed paws i think
[2024-08-17T04:17:43] haku: nvm the golden retriver has webbed feet
[2024-08-17T04:18:54] Noname: It's a water dog so prob
[2024-08-17T04:20:04] Noname: He'd go on 8 mile run to the water. We're like where's the dog he'd come back all wet like really dude.
[2024-08-17T04:21:08] haku: some breeds really need to get tired out. or they become restless
[2024-08-17T04:21:57] haku: my dog would chew plastic toys and bottles if he doesnt get walk/run
[2024-08-17T04:25:27] Noname: Well dog was free to roam so he didn't do that
[2024-08-17T04:26:29] Noname: They have scooters your dog pulls you on. Saw one for sale here before
[2024-08-17T04:27:16] Noname: But to hot anyways
[2024-08-17T04:31:10] haku: i ride on with his pace.
[2024-08-17T09:32:44] Yamal: <photos/photo_16903@17-08-2024_09-32-44.jpg>
[2024-08-17T10:35:00] Smart Repair: Does anyone know about the IMU configuration? I wonder if it would be possible to implement an anti-wheelie function.
[2024-08-17T10:54:19] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-08-17T11:19:48] Yamal: :)
[2024-08-17T11:43:28] Yamal: Whatever hehe
[2024-08-17T11:52:53] GABE: love those they're in my garden
[2024-08-17T11:55:02] 'lekrsu': :)
[2024-08-17T12:14:41] Yamal: They are not the same type of blackberry,, the one I showed is blackberry
[2024-08-17T12:15:10] Yamal: The plant itself has a lot of thorns.
[2024-08-17T12:17:54] Yamal: Anyway, they are all good and you can also make jam with them👌
[2024-08-17T13:27:23] cihan: Baldo is tastier. I don't know why people like basmati. Less tasty and more expensive. https://it.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldo_(riso)
[2024-08-17T13:33:52] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-08-17T13:34:18] Yamal: You are a gourmet, right?
[2024-08-17T13:34:32] Yamal: haute cuisine
[2024-08-17T13:35:12] Yamal: 🤙
[2024-08-17T14:06:14] cihan: No but I ate basmati a few times and it didn't have the taste of baldo. Basmati cannot absorb as much water and butter as baldo.
[2024-08-17T14:14:02] cihan: Maybe it depends on how you cook it. Afghans in Turkey all eat basmati and hate baldo but I don't know how they cook it. Most common cooking in Turkey is frying rice for a while with butter and then adding hot water and salt and let it absorb the water. It's not a meal when cooked this way. They cook rice with lots of ingredients and meat too and it's a meal itself.
[2024-08-17T14:18:34] Yamal: There are many ways to cook rice, basmati is usually washed before cooking
[2024-08-17T14:51:41] Finn: <photos/photo_16907@17-08-2024_14-51-41.jpg>
[2024-08-17T14:53:50] Finn: <video_file>
[2024-08-17T14:59:10] Smart Repair: this is beyond my capabilities... is there anyone here who can do the configuration for me? of course I will pay for it
[2024-08-17T15:22:51] Rose: Hey there wolfsnowrider, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-08-17T15:23:49] NetworkDir: also add cap on 12V
[2024-08-17T15:23:58] NetworkDir: :)
[2024-08-17T15:25:31] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: l'invention n'a pas bien fonctionné
[2024-08-17T15:29:40] Finn: I already put it back in the case
[2024-08-17T15:30:11] Finn: 10A phase is max without getting oversaturared
[2024-08-17T15:30:20] Finn: Phase cables are 1,5m long
[2024-08-17T15:59:42] cihan: We also wash baldo to remove excess starch on the surface.
[2024-08-17T16:34:25] Apo: Which observer type are u guys using? Currently I'm running Ortega original but I wonder if that's the best choice
[2024-08-17T16:34:31] Apo: <photos/photo_16908@17-08-2024_16-34-31.jpg>
[2024-08-17T17:50:19] GABE: Hey guys, best irl friend of mine wants his scoot modded. It's a kugoo with a 2000w motor (advertised) and he's looking into getting a VESC and a 20s6p moli.
[2024-08-17T17:51:24] GABE: He's asking what speed will it go, I said I don't know. Does anyone know how fast a 2000w 50-55h will go with 20s6p moli? (the most the motor can take anyways
[2024-08-17T17:51:36] GABE: It went 70 with the stock controller at 16s, the motor never heated.
[2024-08-17T17:52:04] GABE: I'm guessing 6kw on it absolute maximum but that's an upgrade from like 3kw with the stock controller
[2024-08-17T17:58:15] puneDir: What scooter is it
[2024-08-17T19:22:49] Rose: Hey there Dede, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-08-17T19:24:43] GABE: Kugoo g4
[2024-08-17T19:25:01] GABE: the motor is terribly oversized the 18650 pack inside that can only do like what 50a
[2024-08-17T19:25:10] puneDir: 60h?
[2024-08-17T19:25:20] GABE: i believe it is the 22x3 variant
[2024-08-17T19:25:34] puneDir: Nice then
[2024-08-17T19:25:44] GABE: its not split rim.
[2024-08-17T19:25:51] GABE: it needs a new tyre aswell
[2024-08-17T19:25:54] GABE: he wants PMTS on it
[2024-08-17T19:25:59] GABE: he said he has money to spend, the original tyre is tubeless btw
[2024-08-17T19:26:52] puneDir: Overkill
[2024-08-17T19:27:04] GABE: What would you recomend for a 60h at 20s with sufficient amps?
[2024-08-17T19:27:30] GABE: that is, even a 20s6p can work. he wants to go dual in the future, im helping him with the project.
[2024-08-17T19:28:17] GABE: damn, if someone knew for definite what speed will go, i think @the_hackintosh has a single 65h that does 100 and doesnt heat much. im sure a 60h will be no different, it will be on the rear also but im sure thats fine
[2024-08-17T19:29:34] GABE: purely because it does 70 at 16s.
[2024-08-17T19:29:34] Hackintoshhhh: Torque gonna be insane if he takes a balanced with 120A battery at least
[2024-08-17T19:29:51] GABE: og motor is 60h i believe, he wants to keep it for now
[2024-08-17T19:30:19] GABE: use up that motor before doing any new upgrades
[2024-08-17T19:30:32] GABE: yes, he says the acceleration is lacking.
[2024-08-17T19:30:34] Hackintoshhhh: Yeah 60H more than enough
[2024-08-17T19:30:45] GABE: even if its 50-55h im sure itll be lit with 6p moli
[2024-08-17T19:30:47] Hackintoshhhh: I scratched low 80‘s with 50H
[2024-08-17T19:30:57] Hackintoshhhh: 70A batt
[2024-08-17T19:31:02] GABE: thats nothing
[2024-08-17T19:31:04] GABE: did it heat?
[2024-08-17T19:31:08] Hackintoshhhh: No
[2024-08-17T19:31:20] GABE: 70a x 72v thats 5kw
[2024-08-17T19:31:20] Hackintoshhhh: With fwk yes
[2024-08-17T19:31:28] Hackintoshhhh: But no fwk needed
[2024-08-17T19:31:37] GABE: how much with none? acceleration insane?
[2024-08-17T19:31:45] Hackintoshhhh: If i don’t do insane speed runs i operate my scoots without fwk
[2024-08-17T19:32:04] Hackintoshhhh: Maybe 50C inside. Can only assume tho cuz no sensor
[2024-08-17T19:32:08] GABE: for 50h i think even 7kw is fine, thats like what triple wattage
[2024-08-17T19:32:21] Hackintoshhhh: I can say though that 65H was never above 65C
[2024-08-17T19:32:37] GABE: yeah his kugoo is gonna rip with moli and an 80100
[2024-08-17T19:32:57] GABE: itll be what a kugoo shouldve been
[2024-08-17T19:33:10] Hackintoshhhh: Oh please not the mks 80100 piece of shit
[2024-08-17T19:33:10] GABE: pleeeenty for that 50-60h
[2024-08-17T19:33:14] GABE: no, spintend
[2024-08-17T19:33:15] GABE: ew
[2024-08-17T19:33:22] GABE: haha
[2024-08-17T19:33:28] Hackintoshhhh: No idea why Izuna uses it
[2024-08-17T19:33:39] GABE: told him very possible itll hit 100
[2024-08-17T19:33:48] GABE: with single
[2024-08-17T19:34:07] GABE: 33x2?
[2024-08-17T19:34:24] Hackintoshhhh: Yeah 60H should saturate somewhere around 7kw making 100kmh possible
[2024-08-17T19:34:44] Hackintoshhhh: No idea, got the motor from Roger and even he didn’t know
[2024-08-17T19:35:05] GABE: Told him not much like only 450 for the batt or so and BMS and 150 for an esc lol
[2024-08-17T19:35:10] GABE: he said sure no problem
[2024-08-17T19:35:11] GABE: lmfao
[2024-08-17T19:35:33] Hackintoshhhh: I always name a sky high price and haggle from there
[2024-08-17T19:35:45] GABE: ill prob only charge him 100-200 for doing it cause hes my closest friend.
[2024-08-17T19:35:53] haku: that motor is 50h. 16x4
[2024-08-17T19:36:10] Hackintoshhhh: Lucky you, my friends expect it done for free
[2024-08-17T19:36:10] GABE: fr? how do you know
[2024-08-17T19:36:13] GABE: its not mentioned anyway
[2024-08-17T19:36:26] Hackintoshhhh: Prolly standard for 50H
[2024-08-17T19:36:33] haku: because only 72v scooters get 60h
[2024-08-17T19:36:33] GABE: Eh yeah but im not gonna say im doing x this y that im just gonna set a price
[2024-08-17T19:36:48] GABE: im not really lying its just like i said yeah itll cost x amount you knoiw
[2024-08-17T19:36:59] GABE: if he wants to see the price of every part then sure ask and we will sort something out
[2024-08-17T19:37:24] haku: 60v is normally 50h. or less
[2024-08-17T19:37:30] GABE: yeah its 16-17s
[2024-08-17T19:37:36] Andrei Albert: Zero 11x its 72v stock and 50h motors
[2024-08-17T19:37:38] GABE: Right, even so, that 50h is nowhere near saturated
[2024-08-17T19:37:40] Andrei Albert: But 11 inch
[2024-08-17T19:38:16] GABE: im surprised 16x4 goes that fast at at 16s low amps
[2024-08-17T19:38:31] GABE: maybe its 22x3 or some weird variation idk lol
[2024-08-17T19:38:57] haku: maybe. im not sure
[2024-08-17T19:39:05] haku: but not 60h
[2024-08-17T19:39:19] GABE: yeah 60h is usually a ''3kw equivalent'' for scooter companies
[2024-08-17T19:39:59] haku: kugoo uses the same as laotie i think
[2024-08-17T19:40:13] haku: or equivalent

[2024-08-17T19:53:59] Andrei Albert: Thunder 1 thunder 2

[2024-08-17T21:05:26] haku: all you need to know that hes a good man and will save humanity
[2024-08-17T21:05:28] Yamal: It has a perfume name

[2024-08-17T21:44:09] Finn: <video_file>
[2024-08-17T21:44:49] Finn: Weird is that the ppm input doesnt read the input continious only when selecting ppm as an app
[2024-08-17T21:45:56] haku: what tires are those. they look big
[2024-08-17T21:46:03] puneDir: 12 inch
[2024-08-17T21:46:08] puneDir: Front is 10 inch
[2024-08-17T21:46:12] haku: thats nice!.
[2024-08-17T21:46:18] puneDir: I will buy 12 inch for both
[2024-08-17T21:46:22] haku: link dude
[2024-08-17T21:46:23] puneDir: My tires are fucked
[2024-08-17T21:46:48] haku: that a 6.5 rim yea?
[2024-08-17T21:47:08] Finn: The script works perfect
[2024-08-17T21:47:58] puneDir: 6
[2024-08-17T21:48:05] puneDir: Xuancheng 90-65-6
[2024-08-17T21:48:15] puneDir: I only have link for local sites
[2024-08-17T21:48:40] haku: gotcha thanks
[2024-08-17T21:48:56] cihan: Sent to saved messages, nice info
[2024-08-17T21:48:59] puneDir: Without extender it looks like a baby
[2024-08-17T21:51:02] Andrei Albert: Cargo scooter
[2024-08-17T21:51:58] Finn: The ppm input from the vesc controller is disabled bc default and only enables when switching the app to ppm
[2024-08-17T21:52:06] Finn: Because its a vesc issue
[2024-08-17T21:54:13] Unknown: Kaabo Mantis 10 Pro 60v 1000w above
[2024-08-17T21:54:28] Unknown: 45H 20~23Kv
[2024-08-17T21:55:35] haku: is it possible to stretch a 6 tire to a 6.5 rim?
[2024-08-17T21:56:02] haku: has anyone done that?
[2024-08-17T21:58:50] Finn: The script is indeed working perfect with vesc
[2024-08-17T21:58:51] Yamal: zero 10 will soon be ready to make motorcycles nervous
[2024-08-17T21:59:02] Finn: I will try that but idk how to code in lisp
[2024-08-17T21:59:44] Finn: Because the ppm input used by my paddle assist is not enabled by default only when swithcing the app to it
[2024-08-17T21:59:48] Yamal: I think Network is starting to get nervous now...
[2024-08-17T21:59:56] NetworkDir: XD
[2024-08-17T22:00:07] Finn: Yes
[2024-08-17T22:01:33] NetworkDir: I dont want more 8kW because enough for me I just need comfortable and stable thing not like makerbase
[2024-08-17T22:03:10] Finn: <photos/photo_16925@17-08-2024_22-03-10.jpg>
[2024-08-17T22:03:23] Finn: Fixed it like i said
[2024-08-17T22:03:35] Yamal: That's like everything until you try 16kw, then you'll want 24... the power in scooters is always good to have even if you don't use it, you will use it!!!
[2024-08-17T22:03:47] Finn: Even after reboot works fine
[2024-08-17T22:04:04] Finn: Sure
[2024-08-17T22:04:17] Finn: https://vesc-project.com/node/3689
[2024-08-17T22:05:29] Finn: Doesnt work with 3pin pas
[2024-08-17T22:05:34] Finn: Only with 4 pin
[2024-08-17T22:05:45] Finn: Otherwise i would use that
[2024-08-17T22:06:36] Finn: Mine ist just a dumb magnet sensor and its registering the magnetd when they fly by
[2024-08-17T22:09:14] Finn: Yeah
[2024-08-17T22:09:26] Finn: Mine just does full power😂
[2024-08-17T22:09:39] Finn: But it isnt that bad. 10A phase is maximum anyways
[2024-08-17T22:10:41] NetworkDir: yeah of course
[2024-08-17T22:11:11] NetworkDir: it's just not for scooter it's happened on car motorcycle and etc
[2024-08-17T22:12:28] Finn: You mean paddle sensor?
[2024-08-17T22:12:41] Finn: Sure when you got the right gear ratio
[2024-08-17T22:13:04] Finn: Maybe a sensor to track which gear youre in would be nice too so it knows whats the speed
[2024-08-17T22:13:16] Finn: Theres an ebike
[2024-08-17T22:13:18] Finn: Goes up to 90
[2024-08-17T22:13:23] Finn: And it has paddle assist
[2024-08-17T22:13:56] Finn: https://shop.mysuperebike.com/products/ebike-v5
[2024-08-17T22:14:05] Finn: Lisp does the job
[2024-08-17T22:21:37] puneDir: It was already doing it :D
[2024-08-17T22:21:44] haku: that is expensive. you can get better parts for less on that frame
[2024-08-17T22:24:10] Yamal: Ready to gooo
[2024-08-17T22:24:57] haku: <photos/photo_16927@17-08-2024_22-24-57.jpg>
[2024-08-17T22:25:33] haku: get the trampa str500 if spending 6k
[2024-08-17T22:57:13] Yamal: <photos/photo_16928@17-08-2024_22-57-13.jpg>
[2024-08-17T23:02:47] Yamal: driving with willow
[2024-08-17T23:04:13] haku: your road signs so fancy there
[2024-08-17T23:32:42] Rose: Hey there km, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-08-17T23:40:42] crimeware: <video_file>
[2024-08-17T23:47:36] Yamal: Finish for today 😂
[2024-08-17T23:51:13] Paolo ⁭: Tronic is so lonely 😭
[2024-08-17T23:51:42] Yamal: Well, they are old signs, I would say.. Not everything that glitters is gold haku!
[2024-08-17T23:52:16] Yamal: Willy fog?
[2024-08-18T00:05:32] Yamal: Now I can't stop thinking of names for the electronics of the shaman :), but in the end it is what it is, you do what you can, luckily I can escape a little and do a few kilometers
[2024-08-18T00:08:06] haku: dam choices. vsett 50h motors or this. this is really good deal too.
[2024-08-18T00:08:49] haku: how much are vsett 50h motors in EU?
[2024-08-18T00:18:06] Yamal: Maybe in AliExpress there are ? I don’t know .. Paolo know …
[2024-08-18T00:19:45] haku: more than i can afford
[2024-08-18T00:20:23] haku: there was a clearance sale once on alien rides or rev rides i think. $100 ea
[2024-08-18T00:20:39] Yamal: Shipping 89…..
[2024-08-18T00:21:42] Yamal: <photos/photo_16932@18-08-2024_00-21-42.jpg>
[2024-08-18T00:24:13] Yamal: https://a.aliexpress.com/_EyYUmbJ

[2024-08-18T00:26:25] Yamal: https://a.aliexpress.com/_Ez4c3qZ
[2024-08-18T00:27:18] haku: i blame inflation. or tarrifs
[2024-08-18T00:28:06] Yamal: Ask in the group ninebot
[2024-08-18T00:30:02] Yamal: I have an original 11" Nami engine... but it is not suitable for G30
[2024-08-18T00:31:02] haku: nice. i have an 11 too. thats what i originaly wanted foe g30. but too much modifications and it will be too big
[2024-08-18T00:31:59] haku: i want it portable but still powerful
[2024-08-18T00:33:27] Yamal: For me, not exceeding 50kg is portable... I am in my monster stage""" looking forward to starting new projects with speed motors
[2024-08-18T00:39:15] haku: just waiting patiently for my minibike scooter frame. this is getting dusty and almost 1yr old and never used lol
[2024-08-18T00:41:09] haku: i wonder if the inside rusted. i have to check
[2024-08-18T00:42:28] haku: this is what i wanted for g30 because i want to recycle it
[2024-08-18T00:42:37] haku: <photos/photo_16935@18-08-2024_00-42-37.jpg>
[2024-08-18T00:46:43] Yamal: 70h/Moli/Ubox and las vegas will be totally yours
[2024-08-18T00:47:23] haku: lol true dat
[2024-08-18T00:48:12] haku: do stators get rusty when not used?
[2024-08-18T00:49:00] haku: prolly not. theres some fast emotos here
[2024-08-18T00:49:06] Lisa: Hello guys has anyone experience with Visual Studio code?
[2024-08-18T00:49:17] Lisa: Can’t seem to get com 3 to work can’t upload smth 😭
[2024-08-18T00:49:22] Lisa: First time idk 🤷‍♂️
[2024-08-18T00:52:03] haku: shaman said not safe
[2024-08-18T00:52:50] Lisa: I want to upload custom firmware to my 3d printer
[2024-08-18T00:52:57] Lisa: Tutorial says so
[2024-08-18T00:53:12] Lisa: But can’t get Access to com3
[2024-08-18T00:54:07] Lisa: Idk haha maybe you can help me? You got time?
[2024-08-18T00:54:40] Lisa: Windows :(
[2024-08-18T00:54:55] Lisa: Anycubic mega x haha
[2024-08-18T00:55:10] Lisa: 😭
[2024-08-18T01:00:24] Lisa: Ah just looked again visual studio code with the plug in Plattform IO
[2024-08-18T01:00:57] Yamal: HakuBike is coming
[2024-08-18T01:05:01] haku: yep i will call it the elon bike
[2024-08-18T01:05:31] haku: because it will have a giant elons face on the side
[2024-08-18T01:06:36] haku: one side elon and one side the real president 45,47
[2024-08-18T01:07:10] Yamal: contact him and tell him to pay you to show his face around Vegas ;), has money
[2024-08-18T01:07:15] haku: the message is make electric great again.
[2024-08-18T01:07:52] Yamal: I would do the same with Vedder but of course without charging, mine is pure love for Vesc
[2024-08-18T01:27:31] Yamal: And new controllers are not expected from spintend...? new models..
[2024-08-18T01:29:10] haku: im sure there will be
[2024-08-18T01:30:04] haku: mini spintend
[2024-08-18T01:31:04] haku: they need to cater to ebike emoto market
[2024-08-18T01:35:56] Yamal: The truth is that the minis look very good for a lot of scooters, but I didn't like seeing them break with 160A phase + fw
[2024-08-18T01:37:49] Yamal: It supposedly comes from the factory with a safe maximum of 135A.
[2024-08-18T01:39:30] Yamal: On the other hand, there are other people who have used them with 180A/200A without problem... so you don't know what to think anymore...
[2024-08-18T01:47:54] Yamal: https://youtu.be/vc82T4Y4rpE?si=kCimWlocA0pRxPOC
[2024-08-18T01:59:34] haku: what version vesctool is that
[2024-08-18T02:02:48] 'lekrsu': Whatever existed 3 years ago ))
[2024-08-18T02:03:13] haku: only the vesc vets know
[2024-08-18T02:03:20] 'lekrsu': Ordered the Magura & a 160mm disc. Hopefully the valve is reachable.
[2024-08-18T02:03:27] 'lekrsu': 💸
[2024-08-18T02:03:58] Yamal: For G30?
[2024-08-18T02:05:10] Yamal: Mt5?
[2024-08-18T02:05:29] 'lekrsu': mt sport
[2024-08-18T02:05:59] Yamal: Wouh
[2024-08-18T02:06:24] Yamal: <photos/photo_16936@18-08-2024_02-06-24.jpg>
[2024-08-18T02:07:00] Yamal: I’m really happy with mt7
[2024-08-18T02:09:00] Paolo ⁭: It cost notning
[2024-08-18T02:09:58] 'lekrsu': Heard it was good👍
[2024-08-18T02:11:07] Paolo ⁭: Not very good
[2024-08-18T02:11:13] Yamal: Paolo, do you think the motors I have can withstand 300A each? the phases and so on,?
[2024-08-18T02:11:15] Paolo ⁭: But better than china zoom yes
[2024-08-18T02:11:37] Paolo ⁭: Without cable mod I'd say no
[2024-08-18T02:11:47] Yamal: :( sad
[2024-08-18T02:11:52] Yamal: 250A?
[2024-08-18T02:12:14] Paolo ⁭: If you're cable is short yes
[2024-08-18T02:12:34] Paolo ⁭: But if you're cable goes from rear to the controller by original wire it will overheat
[2024-08-18T02:12:35] 'lekrsu': Beats no brakes!
[2024-08-18T02:13:09] Yamal: 200A okay :)?
[2024-08-18T02:14:24] Paolo ⁭: Why don't just put bigger wire:(
[2024-08-18T02:14:41] Yamal: best engine change😂
[2024-08-18T02:14:43] Paolo ⁭: Also Nami can fit 70h with big wire
[2024-08-18T02:14:54] Yamal: Yes!
[2024-08-18T02:15:16] Yamal: another €1000
[2024-08-18T02:15:21] Paolo ⁭: I don't get why you bought the Rion one , is good yes but only if you want light weight and space limited
[2024-08-18T02:16:44] Yamal: The truth is that the new ones from LY are a candy
[2024-08-18T02:17:13] Yamal: Yes I think..
[2024-08-18T02:18:27] Yamal: but welded from the winding I imagine
[2024-08-18T02:18:46] haku: i thought thick cables are gay. hard to fold
[2024-08-18T02:19:30] haku: how is the huameng 70h with thin cables?
[2024-08-18T02:19:39] haku: or 60h
[2024-08-18T02:20:09] haku: ive seen they have tbose new split rim tubelss
[2024-08-18T02:21:16] Yamal: LY 75H engines in my dreams
[2024-08-18T02:21:25] haku: gotcha
[2024-08-18T02:22:52] Andrei Albert: <photos/photo_16937@18-08-2024_02-22-52.jpg>
[2024-08-18T02:23:21] haku: so LY is pretty much the standard for 70h+ motors
[2024-08-18T02:23:25] Paolo ⁭: Just solder by outside is enough
[2024-08-18T02:25:01] Andrei Albert: 12awg from the phases and 8awg after axle
[2024-08-18T02:25:19] Andrei Albert: Didn’t want to drill the axle
[2024-08-18T02:25:42] 'lekrsu': Exposed 10awg
[2024-08-18T02:25:46] 'lekrsu': ))
[2024-08-18T02:25:53] Paolo ⁭: So same as stock :)
[2024-08-18T02:26:08] Andrei Albert: But with good isolation
[2024-08-18T02:26:15] Andrei Albert: Yep
[2024-08-18T02:26:25] 'lekrsu': pvc is fun to melt 🫠
[2024-08-18T02:26:37] Paolo ⁭: It's not pvc😂😂
[2024-08-18T02:27:03] Paolo ⁭: Only external insulation is PVC
[2024-08-18T02:27:04] Andrei Albert: I saw a guy that fitted 8awg through the axle
[2024-08-18T02:27:08] Andrei Albert: On thunder egines
[2024-08-18T02:27:22] Paolo ⁭: Inside is PTFE/Teflon and handle 200C
[2024-08-18T02:27:42] Paolo ⁭: And is expensive af, more than silicone
[2024-08-18T02:27:51] Andrei Albert: Still very thin
[2024-08-18T02:28:03] Paolo ⁭: It's what you think
[2024-08-18T02:28:15] Andrei Albert: I’m not expert
[2024-08-18T02:28:16] Paolo ⁭: Mm2 of cable mate's not how it looks
[2024-08-18T02:28:59] Paolo ⁭: Silicon wire is many many small copper wire covered by tin, so much gap between wires , that's why it looks bigger
[2024-08-18T02:29:40] Paolo ⁭: PTFE wire is with just few conductor but big copper wire, that's why looks small
[2024-08-18T02:30:16] Paolo ⁭: Don't worry, you're not the only
[2024-08-18T02:30:27] Andrei Albert: I know its same but the original wire protection broke
[2024-08-18T02:30:43] Andrei Albert: Had to change it
[2024-08-18T02:31:04] Paolo ⁭: You can just read the label, normally size are labeled as "awg" or mm^2
[2024-08-18T02:31:05] Andrei Albert: Anyway already sold that engines
[2024-08-18T02:31:42] Andrei Albert: Thats why a lot of people remove the pbc
[2024-08-18T02:31:43] Andrei Albert: Pvc
[2024-08-18T02:31:47] Paolo ⁭: Teorically is a protection to prevent cable short
[2024-08-18T02:33:06] Andrei Albert: I have some kids pushing 230 PA in stock engines
[2024-08-18T02:33:17] Andrei Albert: No wonder if they break it weekly
[2024-08-18T02:33:57] Andrei Albert: Thunder 1
[2024-08-18T02:34:29] Paolo ⁭: How it works at 230a without hall
[2024-08-18T02:35:14] Andrei Albert: Pretty well actually
[2024-08-18T02:35:36] Andrei Albert: Spinted 85250
[2024-08-18T02:36:44] Andrei Albert: We have a guy that knows pretty well to tune them
[2024-08-18T02:38:06] Yamal: How many kw do you reach with the spintend?
[2024-08-18T02:38:50] haku: this makes sense. i was wondering why diameter is smaller but same awg
[2024-08-18T02:39:09] Andrei Albert: Idk what they got but i know they have stock battery
[2024-08-18T02:39:15] Andrei Albert: So not much
[2024-08-18T02:40:45] Yamal: Let's see who is the first to prepare with Sevęn
[2024-08-18T02:41:01] Andrei Albert: Eheheheheeeeee
[2024-08-18T02:41:11] Andrei Albert: Who got the money
[2024-08-18T02:42:10] haku: seven vesc seems to cater more to emotos. scooters have smaller battery compartment. prolly cant use full power
[2024-08-18T02:42:49] haku: im just talking out my ass but thats my opinion
[2024-08-18T02:43:20] Andrei Albert: Not if u make a custom chasy
[2024-08-18T02:43:26] Andrei Albert: Chassis
[2024-08-18T02:43:49] haku: agreed but that will be a gigantic battery box
[2024-08-18T02:44:01] haku: might aswell get a seated moto
[2024-08-18T02:44:06] Andrei Albert: Depends on how much battery you want
[2024-08-18T02:44:16] Andrei Albert: Right
[2024-08-18T02:44:21] Yamal: 30s30p30seven
[2024-08-18T02:44:27] Andrei Albert: 😂😂
[2024-08-18T02:44:39] Andrei Albert: Gooffy ass scooter
[2024-08-18T02:45:33] haku: i tried making one of those. i have a huge battery box but i did not go thru with it
[2024-08-18T02:45:47] haku: looks weird
[2024-08-18T02:51:14] haku: the biggest gayest scooter if i went with it. blue mans scooter
[2024-08-18T02:51:27] Yamal: 18 seven no really big….
[2024-08-18T02:51:52] haku: but need a big battery to use it to its fullest
[2024-08-18T02:52:03] haku: unless 40pl
[2024-08-18T02:53:20] haku: i do want one someday though. for a moto
[2024-08-18T02:53:48] Yamal: Shull 350
[2024-08-18T02:55:29] Yamal: ..
[2024-08-18T02:56:09] haku: affordable and reliable though
[2024-08-18T02:57:25] haku: you have to look at it in a poor mans point of view. would you rather have expensive fancy vesc or affordable reliable vesc and a months worth of rice
[2024-08-18T02:57:44] haku: i choose the later
[2024-08-18T03:00:42] haku: its the governments fault that we have to choose between these options. 4 years ago i can by both. now i cant. i blame the government
[2024-08-18T03:01:35] Yamal: In the end everything has to go in harmony, since they are so powerful for motors with small phases, it is a waste just like using stock batteries, unless you think about the heat, the temperature of your controllers will never be a problem,, It will always be loose, but it's like having a Ferrari and pouring sunflower oil on it to make it run...
[2024-08-18T03:02:27] Yamal: but be clear that all these controllers must be tested in the future
[2024-08-18T03:03:04] Yamal: It is not something impossible, you just have to want it and your time will come.
[2024-08-18T03:04:30] Yamal: but yes, the rice is very delicious
[2024-08-18T03:04:59] haku: i blame the illegals. they taking my money.
[2024-08-18T03:06:54] Yamal: The problem of this world "" the fluss
[2024-08-18T03:11:28] Yamal: If I have the opportunity why not!
[2024-08-18T03:11:36] Yamal: You too xD
[2024-08-18T03:12:47] Noname: It's not all size but form factor. My nuculars fets are on the side so I would have had to stand them up. Needed a shim to have deck touch one side. The Vesc are longer? But flat so wiring went over the top.
[2024-08-18T03:13:39] Noname: Just the thin profile works so well for scooters
[2024-08-18T03:24:24] haku: i blame taylor swift
[2024-08-18T03:29:23] Finn: https://youtu.be/R0OVIQzvA4I
[2024-08-18T03:29:37] Finn: Interesting outrunner principe
[2024-08-18T05:54:03] haku: i want to build an mp2 vesc and ive heard the only problem is cooling with those. this will prolly fix that.
[2024-08-18T09:30:38] Izuna 生活: what

[2024-08-18T19:19:50] Yamal: Scooter ?
[2024-08-18T19:19:52] Hackintoshhhh: what spotwelder do you use?
[2024-08-18T19:20:16] GABE: 801D.
[2024-08-18T19:20:27] haku: yes. its kinda cool
[2024-08-18T19:21:27] Hackintoshhhh: https://de.aliexpress.com/i/1005003476031459.html?gatewayAdapt=glo2deu dis one?
[2024-08-18T19:30:52] Oreo huzky: On what setting?
[2024-08-18T19:44:05] GABE: absolute maximum.
[2024-08-18T19:44:11] GABE: 100%
[2024-08-18T19:45:02] GABE: Nickel is a nono, but iron/steel is doable.
[2024-08-18T19:45:37] GABE: Nickel possible with 0.8mm copper sure, that's 20% less impedance and will compensate for the nickel, even 0.15mm
[2024-08-18T19:55:40] Mirono escooters: .8mm copper??
[2024-08-18T19:56:13] Hackintoshhhh: Apparently yes. he showed me

[2024-08-18T21:22:32] haku: you mean. .1copper yea?
[2024-08-18T21:23:36] GABE: .1 copper only with iron or steel sandwich.
[2024-08-18T21:23:52] haku: let me guess? france?
[2024-08-18T21:24:02] GABE: nickel is too conductive so no go
[2024-08-18T21:24:06] GABE: hence
[2024-08-18T21:24:33] GABE: 1mm I use with steel 1mm
[2024-08-18T21:25:21] Smart Repair: I have the same device, it stops at 0.1 copper...
[2024-08-18T21:25:28] GABE: 0.1 copper with steel/iron is perfect and I believe steel is even better (because it's worse)
[2024-08-18T21:25:49] GABE: With nickel your battery will tear up with time.
[2024-08-18T21:26:24] Yamal: United States of course
[2024-08-18T21:26:31] GABE: the less conductive the sandwich metal the better because there's more heat = more fusion
[2024-08-18T21:27:04] Smart Repair: Glitter 801D 0.1 copper/0.1 plated
[2024-08-18T21:27:09] Andrei Albert: Off scooters tonight
[2024-08-18T21:27:17] GABE: plated means nickel plated steel, correct?
[2024-08-18T21:28:18] GABE: pure nickel strip sandwich tears away from cells with hand strength with 801D at 100 Wouldve been very bad if I made the moli pack with nickel+copper
[2024-08-18T21:29:57] GABE: Just clarifying so nobody tries it
[2024-08-18T21:30:00] haku: that copper has a nice patina
[2024-08-18T21:30:05] Yamal: a little lazy to take the scooter with only one engine, today I only climbed the Chinese with it to get a seven up and little else...😭
[2024-08-18T21:30:09] GABE: Patina? pattern?
[2024-08-18T21:30:26] haku: oxidation
[2024-08-18T21:30:28] GABE: it's low grade 99% copper so not even 99.9
[2024-08-18T21:30:29] GABE: Yees
[2024-08-18T21:30:37] GABE: prone to oxidation impure is
[2024-08-18T21:30:54] GABE: which is BETTER
[2024-08-18T21:31:23] haku: i did not know that. cool
[2024-08-18T21:31:43] GABE: if anything 100% copper would make welding even weaker.
[2024-08-18T21:32:00] GABE: 99% adds some extra headroom for the sandwich material
[2024-08-18T21:32:43] GABE: <animation>
[2024-08-18T21:51:42] haku: 50cent baby
[2024-08-18T21:53:55] haku: realest rapper speaks his mind.
[2024-08-18T21:55:35] Mirono escooters: Impedance is ac stuff
[2024-08-18T21:56:00] Mirono escooters: Or eh maybe it works for it, but not used xd
[2024-08-18T21:56:25] Mirono escooters: It does that after a while
[2024-08-18T21:56:27] Mirono escooters: Doesn't hurt it
[2024-08-18T21:56:52] haku: i liked polished. personal taste
[2024-08-18T21:58:46] haku: with all due respect to @Gabzy_x but that copper looks like it was salvaged from the titanic
[2024-08-18T21:58:50] Mirono escooters: But who will see it xD
[2024-08-18T21:59:03] Mirono escooters: If ya don't coat it it'll turn that color soon
[2024-08-18T21:59:15] haku: my concience will see it
[2024-08-18T22:01:13] haku: you cannot unsee it and will live in my head rent free like the blue man
[2024-08-18T22:32:24] GABE: You fooled me with the blue man

[2024-08-18T22:38:00] Noname: Sorry
[2024-08-18T22:38:20] haku: Noname
[2024-08-18T22:38:48] Noname: Wtf
[2024-08-18T22:40:33] Noname: Should prob stop driving mine through water. Wonder what the motor looks like
[2024-08-18T22:42:09] Yamal: 🤙⚡️
[2024-08-18T22:42:52] haku: now thats a seat
[2024-08-18T22:51:43] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: That's not your scooter 🤣
[2024-08-18T22:52:34] Noname: I'm assuming your asking what scooter? Niu sport
[2024-08-18T22:54:46] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Put sealed bearings plus a seal so water doesn't get in
[2024-08-18T22:55:23] Noname: <photos/photo_16952@18-08-2024_22-55-23.jpg>
[2024-08-18T22:55:36] Noname: Don't drive through floods
[2024-08-18T22:56:01] haku: just prolly just bearing grease amd rust
[2024-08-18T22:59:37] Noname: Poped the cover off the better side. Must have missed the grease part during assembly
[2024-08-18T23:03:34] GABE: What other 11 inch tyres would be good for 6~kw?
[2024-08-18T23:04:24] GABE: He said whats the best tyres there is abd I said PMTS and he was like sure but perhaps something cheaper for him would be better. But at the same time if he ever goes dual he will have 2 PMTS at the ready
[2024-08-18T23:04:56] GABE: Oh yeah also @Bradhaku the Kugoo G4 motor is 11" rim perhaps it's bigger than 50h therefore.
[2024-08-18T23:05:23] haku: i doubt it. measure it
[2024-08-18T23:05:32] GABE: I'd have to open the thing
[2024-08-18T23:05:36] GABE: right?
[2024-08-18T23:05:47] haku: yes.
[2024-08-18T23:05:57] GABE: He said he wants a temp sensor anyways, so I'll have to open it
[2024-08-18T23:06:19] haku: do you have a photo of the motor?
[2024-08-18T23:07:07] GABE: I'll ask him to take a pic
[2024-08-18T23:07:16] GABE: and DM you about it later
[2024-08-18T23:07:22] haku: measure it. only way to see
[2024-08-18T23:07:46] GABE: it's not split rim, that's for sure. I'm unsure if that's even physically possible.
[2024-08-18T23:07:56] GABE: Front is not split rim
[2024-08-18T23:08:03] GABE: And yet has a tubeless
[2024-08-18T23:08:11] haku: you can open any motor
[2024-08-18T23:08:23] GABE: Yeah, I just mean that changing tyres will be aids
[2024-08-18T23:08:41] GABE: I mean should be fine, do I need any other thing to put on tubeless?
[2024-08-18T23:08:47] GABE: a belt?
[2024-08-18T23:09:07] haku: you have to be strong like man. tubeless is easy
[2024-08-18T23:09:30] haku: need tire pry bars
[2024-08-18T23:09:43] GABE: I heard itll never be fully straight without a compressor and a belt
[2024-08-18T23:09:47] GABE: but I'm unsure on that
[2024-08-18T23:10:02] GABE: I'm sure Hella Lube and no belt will be fine
[2024-08-18T23:10:08] haku: take it to tire shop or ratchet straps
[2024-08-18T23:10:09] Yamal: Tubeles 😂
[2024-08-18T23:10:28] GABE: Ah so any belt works?
[2024-08-18T23:10:35] GABE: did you use a compressor
[2024-08-18T23:11:04] GABE: car garage down the road should be able to do this, but unsure if they'll rip me off
[2024-08-18T23:11:07] haku: ratchet straps. i got it to work with regular electric air pump
[2024-08-18T23:11:10] Yamal: He caught me coming from a long route at night, and I was able to save my skin like this
[2024-08-18T23:11:39] Yamal: many times the tires bead without anything, but other times it is good to use this
[2024-08-18T23:11:42] haku: ive seen some do it with zipties too
[2024-08-18T23:11:52] GABE: <photos/photo_16954@18-08-2024_23-11-52.jpg>
[2024-08-18T23:12:15] GABE: Yeah he's paying for that 😭😂
[2024-08-18T23:12:30] Yamal: <photos/photo_16955@18-08-2024_23-12-30.jpg>
[2024-08-18T23:12:44] GABE: yeah that's it
[2024-08-18T23:12:59] GABE: that looks like a waist belt
[2024-08-18T23:14:52] Yamal: That's called survival GABE, after about 330 km of the route about 70 km from home I had to come up with whatever...
[2024-08-18T23:14:58] haku: the bigger the tire diameter its easier with ratchet straps imo
[2024-08-18T23:15:52] haku: try this
[2024-08-18T23:17:02] haku: i will have 13" on my minibike scooter. this is 12
[2024-08-18T23:17:46] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: si pone un rodamiento sellado puede ir por agua no hay ningún problema.
[2024-08-18T23:17:53] haku: i wish they made 14 road tires

[2024-08-19T00:09:42] GABE: so i only need 1 strap

[2024-08-19T01:13:45] haku: good to see vesc used here too. this is badass
[2024-08-19T01:15:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I guess it's very hard to put such big tyre on ?
[2024-08-19T01:17:18] haku: maybe for non tubeless split rim. but even with normal rims its not that hard. hardest part maybe is to get it to bead
[2024-08-19T01:18:29] haku: first time i tried i cant figure it out but its actually easy with the right tools
[2024-08-19T01:49:23] haku: this pretty cool. https://youtu.be/h0it7F9VBWg?si=XicB08NpZVuFlcRI

[2024-08-19T11:38:23] Thierry: I just downloaded vesc 6.05 but I'm not able to launch it on windows 10, it was already the case for last beta versions. 6.02 works fine, any idea?
[2024-08-19T11:44:17] Thierry: But all good with ubuntu
[2024-08-19T14:02:25] Yamal: Eski BV !!!
[2024-08-19T14:47:30] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Hi friends, does anyone have a 22s battery voltage table?
[2024-08-19T14:48:38] 'lekrsu': Divide total voltage by 22 and you'll see per group voltage. Then you can compare it to a single cell graph.
[2024-08-19T14:56:05] 'lekrsu': Found some single cell data, so approximately this.
[2024-08-19T14:56:46] 'lekrsu': Based on this
[2024-08-19T14:58:10] 'lekrsu': Otherwise just try and memorize a linear increase of % between 3.1v - 4.2v * 22
[2024-08-19T15:00:17] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Memorizing is complicated for me🤣
[2024-08-19T15:00:39] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Thank you very much for the information
[2024-08-19T15:21:32] GABE: And for 6.5" there's CST and tovut too?

[2024-08-19T15:40:04] Paolo ⁭: 11 inch doesn't fit well on 11
[2024-08-19T15:40:13] Paolo ⁭: When the suspension work will touch the spring

[2024-08-19T16:53:19] Yamal: JREV fork! I don't know why they never use GPS for testing, it's a little sad.
[2024-08-19T16:58:13] Paolo ⁭: Why you want buy vsett motor when there's much better motor which can fit

[2024-08-19T17:00:08] Paolo ⁭: You can fit up to 65h motor, instead of 50h of vsett. You can have about 50-70% better performance
[2024-08-19T17:00:40] Forol1561: 65H+ 90-120 top speed on 72V

[2024-08-19T22:59:27] NetworkDir: Hmm maybe use ptc or 100k ntc
[2024-08-19T22:59:38] NetworkDir: Try 100k ntc and ptc 1k
[2024-08-19T22:59:52] Patrick: Ok i test it, thank you 😇

[2024-08-20T06:49:32] Dede Dede: ?
[2024-08-20T07:11:43] puneDir: What would be my performance gain if i put 60h motors to zero
[2024-08-20T07:11:46] puneDir: It has 50h now
[2024-08-20T08:35:17] GABE: I believe Paolo said 30-50% more speed and acceleration
[2024-08-20T09:11:45] haku: i think it will also depend on esc and battery
[2024-08-20T09:22:14] puneDir: Float the en
[2024-08-20T09:38:07] GABE: Assuming that needed amps are supplied.
[2024-08-20T09:38:56] GABE: but yes if his battery Is not enough he will see a decrease in performance.
[2024-08-20T11:15:04] GABE: @Mirono_escooters can I get away with jus welding copper over this?
[2024-08-20T11:15:20] GABE: I honestly CBA cleaning up another cell batch

[2024-08-20T11:18:42] puneDir: I traded punerons frame with some scooter called onvo rx7
[2024-08-20T11:18:46] puneDir: It has 60h motors
[2024-08-20T11:19:43] Yamal: Few days trottinette? :)
[2024-08-20T11:37:57] yoann tsobanoglou: Hello all, posting here after posting on vsett group. Friend had problems with his vsett10+, riding quality and controllers very harsh on acceleration and slow speeds created problems on his back and shoulders. He also was the only 60v scooter in the group so was being left behind on high speeds. We decided to convert to vesc. He didn’t want something crazy, just smooth and better top end. I updated the stock battery with 32extra cells to make it 20s8p plugged stock nami bms(for now) and installed dual vesc lite 100v100a from spintend. Used adc v2 but waiting for v3 to arrive as I need common ground for the lights(pain in the but because vesc light doesn’t have 12v and had to use 5v relay to 12v converter to power board).

[2024-08-20T11:38:03] yoann tsobanoglou: I have used a separate light bar for now to have rear and brake lights. Lisp code handles stock screen and throttle with 3 modes for speed and acceleration and all the stock screen menu works correctly. Most important request was that the scooter remain stock looking so crazy cable management was required. Will post final pictures once v3 board is installed. Still waiting for pmt tires and fz suspensions to arrive. Other than that, scooter runs crazy smooth and if you feel naughty, you can burn tires no problem.
[2024-08-20T11:48:01] sombre_enfant: Hi could you help me setup the screen while using two Throttle one for brake with hall and other as accelerator i kinda have the same setup
[2024-08-20T11:59:53] yoann tsobanoglou: On adc board? Or on vesc ?
[2024-08-20T12:04:59] yoann tsobanoglou: For this build am handling brake with adc v2 board on slave vesc, and throttle on main vesc directly on adc1 port. Setup is a pain because start voltage for throttle had to be adjusted manually after calibration, when both where connected, I had issues and could not get stable results.
[2024-08-20T12:07:57] haku: noooo. but whatever makes you happy bro
[2024-08-20T12:10:27] sombre_enfant: My two Throttle are connected to adc... I have the adc module but i didnt use it...
[2024-08-20T12:10:54] puneDir: I will build another one when i get into university
[2024-08-20T12:11:13] sombre_enfant: Brake u use the on off sensor of the hydro brake or a regular hall Throttle ?
[2024-08-20T12:14:36] 'lekrsu': Anything not working for you when selecting ADC 2 no reverse brake?
[2024-08-20T12:15:05] Yamal: But the zero or emoto..?
[2024-08-20T12:16:28] haku: i hope its not this one.
[2024-08-20T12:18:00] puneDir: No its not
[2024-08-20T12:18:06] puneDir: Emoto
[2024-08-20T12:18:13] puneDir: Zero is with me
[2024-08-20T12:18:28] puneDir: Maybe i will transfer 60hs to zero
[2024-08-20T12:20:44] sombre_enfant: Idk i didnt tried nun yet
[2024-08-20T12:46:06] GABE: Just got tased by the cell, ITS ALLIVEEEE. Lol, if this was a moli pack and the current went through my bleeding fingers...
[2024-08-20T12:46:09] GABE: 💀
[2024-08-20T12:46:32] GABE: Think my hand would be cooked now
[2024-08-20T13:08:14] Jason: mmmm
[2024-08-20T13:09:19] GABE: 8P 80a 13s quite beefy.
[2024-08-20T13:35:34] GABE: Is 2x 12awg good enough to route positive through the cell?
[2024-08-20T13:35:51] GABE: its super long, I should've done this another way, too late now, all is welded .
[2024-08-20T13:36:10] GABE: Maybe I'll do triple 12awg to make sure
[2024-08-20T13:37:14] Andrei Albert: Double for 80A more than enough
[2024-08-20T13:42:40] Rose: Hey there Lieven, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-08-20T14:02:35] puneDir: I had to
[2024-08-20T14:03:00] puneDir: I have university exam in few months I dont have time from studying
[2024-08-20T14:37:45] GABE: Try learning the entire physics course in 1 week
[2024-08-20T14:37:56] GABE: Not even a guarantee I'll pass tomorrow
[2024-08-20T14:38:06] GABE: Few months 😂
[2024-08-20T14:42:26] sombre_enfant: Yeah better use the dualtron 12v 3a converter if u need its cheap and reliable
[2024-08-20T14:48:21] GABE: What The Pro 2 shouldve been stock
[2024-08-20T14:48:47] GABE: Now to wire BMS and hopefully rideable
[2024-08-20T14:49:02] GABE: @the_hackintosh sent me a V3.1 so I don't have to reinforce
[2024-08-20T14:49:27] puneDir: Im in high school
[2024-08-20T14:49:36] puneDir: This exam is needed to switch to university
[2024-08-20T14:51:14] GABE: Piss take then, don't worry about it till a quarter.
[2024-08-20T14:51:26] GABE: Unless you know absolutely nothing, then do start now indeed
[2024-08-20T14:57:23] GABE: @punedir how do I wire JBD BmS for 13s?
[2024-08-20T14:58:00] GABE: is it keep total positive and negative and go down from each side?
[2024-08-20T15:05:43] puneDir: What
[2024-08-20T15:06:02] puneDir: I didnt understand what you meant
[2024-08-20T15:54:45] yoann tsobanoglou: I take 5v from vesc to Arduino relay, which triggers and opens line on converter plugged on battery to give 12v2a

[2024-08-20T16:04:03] yoann tsobanoglou: You can see the converter on the bottom of the picture. I try to avoid plugging things directly on vesc because we found out they are quite sensitive (especially the ignite port which burned 2 times while testing)
[2024-08-20T16:05:29] yoann tsobanoglou: Thankfully, it’s a common fuse on the bottom of the board, quite accessible and easy to replace
[2024-08-20T16:08:29] Yamal: What do you think of the geometry of this scooter?
[2024-08-20T16:15:22] GABE: It's fine, I found a pic
[2024-08-20T16:15:28] GABE: ugly.
[2024-08-20T16:16:12] GABE: Bad planning, lost 2mm of esc space cause wire placed in wrong place, now I gotta cut the XESC case. I'll simply put thermal paste under the case and cut off the screw holders and the press it down with foam Ugly, but works, and safe.
[2024-08-20T16:17:14] GABE: Imagine BMS doesn't work
[2024-08-20T16:31:35] rosheee: <video_message>
[2024-08-20T16:38:24] GABE: Wtf, I don't remember any cell being 3.6v
[2024-08-20T16:38:26] GABE: NOT GOOD
[2024-08-20T16:38:28] rosheee: Dualubox rofl on rear esc
[2024-08-20T16:38:35] GABE: I ALREADY PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER
[2024-08-20T16:38:54] GABE: OH I USED THAT 3S PACK AND FORGOTTTTT
[2024-08-20T16:39:32] GABE: HOPEFULLY ITS A GOOD ENOUGH BMS TO BALANCEITTT
[2024-08-20T16:44:39] puneDir: Bms would explode if you try to balance this
[2024-08-20T16:46:09] GABE: Yes.
[2024-08-20T16:46:32] GABE: Seems the Fiido L3 13s charger is broken, good riddance, fun over.
[2024-08-20T16:46:55] GABE: voltmeter is sperging out, it shocked me like it was AC. pretty weird. Perhaps it only adds voltage if it senses voltage. But I still don't know what Pos and Neg is therefore. so stupid
[2024-08-20T16:48:08] GABE: I suppose I can wire it 10s and charge the 3s externally
[2024-08-20T16:51:33] GABE: Can't find out what one is pos and neg cause stupid smart charger
[2024-08-20T16:51:34] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-08-20T16:54:22] GABE: Seems to only show voltage if it senses voltage
[2024-08-20T16:54:28] GABE: so no way to measure.
[2024-08-20T16:54:36] GABE: Means I'm locked out
[2024-08-20T16:55:04] GABE: I only got a 50/50 chance shot at this if I do plug in the cell
[2024-08-20T16:56:03] Noname: Dumb idea but hold it to a lightbulb for some resistance and measure?
[2024-08-20T16:56:10] GABE: <photos/photo_16992@20-08-2024_16-56-10.jpg>
[2024-08-20T16:56:29] GABE: I so don't trust this
[2024-08-20T16:56:43] GABE: don't think I have dc bulb lol
[2024-08-20T16:57:08] Noname: Any household 120v they don't discriminate
[2024-08-20T16:57:29] Noname: Not to light up but a controlled short mabey idk
[2024-08-20T16:58:04] Noname: A scoot headlight laying around?
[2024-08-20T16:58:19] Noname: Mine was 60v imput
[2024-08-20T17:04:45] GABE: It fucking worked the last time I used it. makes no fucking sense, piss annoying. It was just laying there.
[2024-08-20T17:04:55] GABE: Yeah, it seems the charger doesn't care
[2024-08-20T17:05:19] GABE: No luck
[2024-08-20T17:05:50] GABE: BUT HOW DID IT TASE ME IF ITS NOT OUTPUTTING VOLTAGE
[2024-08-20T17:06:07] 'lekrsu': You should either see positive of negative readings from the charger even if its low
[2024-08-20T17:06:11] GABE: Oh for fuck sake.
[2024-08-20T17:06:13] GABE: Fuck
[2024-08-20T17:06:16] GABE: You're so fucking right
[2024-08-20T17:06:18] GABE: LOL
[2024-08-20T17:06:50] GABE: It did
[2024-08-20T17:06:52] GABE: Wtf
[2024-08-20T17:07:00] GABE: I'll try again to make sure I'm not tripping
[2024-08-20T17:07:16] GABE: It does fucking tase wtf this is so bizarre
[2024-08-20T17:07:30] 'lekrsu': Did you check bms via app before enclosing it?
[2024-08-20T17:07:54] GABE: BMS is fine, only 3 cells need rebalancing but I can do that from the outside and add kapton in the holes I made.
[2024-08-20T17:08:01] GABE: this a charger issue now
[2024-08-20T17:09:19] GABE: Blue is positive.
[2024-08-20T17:09:31] GABE: Well, then, I KNEW THIS WAS WRONG
[2024-08-20T17:10:02] 'lekrsu': On my charger the one that was *kinda red* was positive
[2024-08-20T17:10:34] 'lekrsu': Why the zeroes then?
[2024-08-20T17:10:56] 'lekrsu': Would it even start if given DC? Never seen a bulb with those contacts
[2024-08-20T17:11:44] GABE: That's how it works.
[2024-08-20T17:11:56] GABE: Sees voltage and brown showed negative at millivolts
[2024-08-20T17:12:01] GABE: I'll try charge the battery now
[2024-08-20T17:12:08] GABE: Knowing that blue is positive.
[2024-08-20T17:12:23] 'lekrsu': Stupid app then honestly
[2024-08-20T17:12:39] 'lekrsu': It should arrange them by 1S to xS
[2024-08-20T17:12:53] 'lekrsu': Not randomly
[2024-08-20T17:12:53] GABE: Weird, I followed the diagram entirely.
[2024-08-20T17:13:05] GABE: <photos/photo_16994@20-08-2024_17-13-05.jpg>
[2024-08-20T17:13:21] 'lekrsu': Did you short them as instructions say?
[2024-08-20T17:13:24] GABE: may have done something wrong.
[2024-08-20T17:13:52] GABE: You're meant to short the middle white cables???
[2024-08-20T17:13:58] GABE: I thought it meant choose any wire
[2024-08-20T17:14:20] 'lekrsu': It's showing the literal wiring
[2024-08-20T17:14:37] GABE: What do I take off first so I don't fry the resistors
[2024-08-20T17:14:40] GABE: do I take off ground first
[2024-08-20T17:14:44] GABE: or just fuck the cables out
[2024-08-20T17:15:00] GABE: which one first, small or big? feels like I'm disarming a bomb
[2024-08-20T17:15:36] GABE: so I'm supposed to wire all the white ones onto one batt terminal
[2024-08-20T17:15:39] GABE: I'll do that now
[2024-08-20T17:15:58] GABE: thankfully it's the external one
[2024-08-20T17:15:58] 'lekrsu': which white ones?
[2024-08-20T17:16:16] 'lekrsu': Your white cables that are printed in red? Yes
[2024-08-20T17:17:14] 'lekrsu': Ah I see, JBD is white
[2024-08-20T17:20:30] GABE: Perfect!!! all works.
[2024-08-20T17:20:35] GABE: Now to see if the charger is good.
[2024-08-20T17:20:52] GABE: <photos/photo_16996@20-08-2024_17-20-52.jpg>
[2024-08-20T17:21:11] GABE: I was meant to put the low voltage batch as the external, but I forgot.
[2024-08-20T17:25:03] GABE: Yeah, I'll manually balance.
[2024-08-20T17:27:10] 'lekrsu': Awesome! Now your next bms will live as well!
[2024-08-20T17:30:04] GABE: <photos/photo_16997@20-08-2024_17-30-04.jpg>
[2024-08-20T17:30:15] GABE: <photos/photo_16998@20-08-2024_17-30-15.jpg>
[2024-08-20T17:30:24] GABE: Annoying but will patch it back up
[2024-08-20T17:30:42] GABE: Will 4.2 and 4v balance?
[2024-08-20T17:32:04] GABE: I set to Li ion so it cuts off at 4.1v
[2024-08-20T17:32:10] GABE: While I play dbd
[2024-08-20T17:32:22] GABE: 4.1v to 4.02v should be fine
[2024-08-20T17:32:24] GABE: I suppose?
[2024-08-20T17:32:29] GABE: I can discharge later if it's bad
[2024-08-20T17:32:45] GABE: Cough, true, indeed it's tomorrow
[2024-08-20T17:32:54] GABE: just gotta learn Boolean algebra today
[2024-08-20T17:32:58] GABE: shouldnt be too hard Going well so far
[2024-08-20T18:42:22] GABE: Barely went up by 0.15v after an hour lol, insane capacity
[2024-08-20T18:58:38] 'lekrsu': Why not set to Li-ion?
[2024-08-20T19:06:49] GABE: It is, so it cuts off at 4.1 then I monitor discharge to 4.02
[2024-08-20T19:07:07] GABE: Is it safe to even use li ion at 4.2v? stupid question
[2024-08-20T19:07:16] GABE: like I'm sure the cycles go down hella
[2024-08-20T19:07:21] puneDir: Yes
[2024-08-20T19:07:28] puneDir: Its deaigned for it
[2024-08-20T19:08:22] puneDir: <photos/photo_16999@20-08-2024_19-08-22.jpg>
[2024-08-20T19:08:22] puneDir: <photos/photo_17000@20-08-2024_19-08-22.jpg>
[2024-08-20T19:08:28] puneDir: Idk what im gonna do this
[2024-08-20T19:08:33] puneDir: It can fit 23s20p
[2024-08-20T19:08:33] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. puneDir has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-08-20T19:08:44] GABE: 2170???
[2024-08-20T19:09:17] 'lekrsu': Yes?
[2024-08-20T19:09:23] GABE: Jeez please don't make me go harder on my battery I already had to beat haku and he had 11p
[2024-08-20T19:11:01] puneDir: It also has 60h motors
[2024-08-20T19:11:28] GABE: so 77kw capacity with regular molis
[2024-08-20T19:11:35] GABE: Yeah, youll need 100h lol
[2024-08-20T19:11:45] GABE: I think they'll still burn anyway
[2024-08-20T19:11:48] GABE: 💀
[2024-08-20T19:12:15] puneDir: I will put its motors to zero maybe
[2024-08-20T19:12:30] GABE: why not just make a 12p g30 save money
[2024-08-20T19:13:12] GABE: Will be an incredible increase in speed and power
[2024-08-20T19:13:53] GABE: how much does this cost?
[2024-08-20T19:15:24] GABE: Oh shit The puneron is gone??? didn't you even have a chance to use it?
[2024-08-20T19:20:39] puneDir: sadly
[2024-08-20T19:20:46] puneDir: 2k euro in turkey
[2024-08-20T19:21:04] puneDir: Now i have zero and this
[2024-08-20T19:21:10] puneDir: I will put 20s10p to this
[2024-08-20T19:21:13] puneDir: Ez 8kw
[2024-08-20T19:21:13] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. puneDir has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-08-20T19:27:36] haku: puneron is better imo. but do what you lke
[2024-08-20T19:27:46] haku: big fan of puneron
[2024-08-20T19:30:59] haku: yea looks like you can fit alot of battery. did you measure it?
[2024-08-20T19:39:53] puneDir: 28 cm width
[2024-08-20T19:39:56] puneDir: Idk the length
[2024-08-20T19:40:02] puneDir: But a lot
[2024-08-20T19:50:44] Finn: Sadly not vesc😂
[2024-08-20T20:14:49] puneDir: Sabri will finish it
[2024-08-20T20:14:56] puneDir: Its still gonna be named as puneron
[2024-08-20T20:15:14] puneDir: <photos/photo_17002@20-08-2024_20-15-14.jpg>
[2024-08-20T20:15:21] puneDir: But it was pretty cool guy
[2024-08-20T20:20:21] Finn: Rip
[2024-08-20T20:23:15] sombre_enfant: Oh it was nice with the body
[2024-08-20T20:25:09] haku: one of the unique builds here in this telegram
[2024-08-20T20:45:16] puneDir: :(
[2024-08-20T20:55:06] haku: my bms says its delivered yesterday. gadam porch pirates.
[2024-08-20T20:55:19] haku: need to check the camera
[2024-08-20T20:55:51] haku: only wires arrived
[2024-08-20T21:04:51] haku: i have to move out the hood. somewhere rural close to water
[2024-08-20T21:07:03] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <video_file>
[2024-08-20T21:22:17] GABE: big boy territory
[2024-08-20T21:22:47] GABE: damnnn
[2024-08-20T21:32:56] GABE: I'm sure he will enjoy your BMS more than you woulve @Bradhaku
[2024-08-20T21:33:18] GABE: Honestly if I was a porch robber and it was some junk I'd just give it back lol
[2024-08-20T21:34:25] haku: i check my cameras. my hood all has cameras.i will track this woke fool down
[2024-08-20T21:35:07] GABE: drive around with a baseball bat at 50mph on scooter and bash his head in that way
[2024-08-20T21:35:22] GABE: Gone before he hits the floor
[2024-08-20T21:35:57] haku: i will have a talk with his mommy
[2024-08-20T22:03:18] Noname: Damn another bms gone to soon
[2024-08-20T22:03:53] haku: i ordered another one last night same 575a ant for my 40t
[2024-08-20T22:04:45] haku: hopefully that arrives
[2024-08-20T22:04:50] Noname: Should have them label box as adult diapers to detur thieves
[2024-08-20T22:32:08] Noname: https://youtu.be/nxnLryAItsk?feature=shared
[2024-08-20T22:32:33] Noname: This guy is gonna learn a hard lesson on range and solar charging 😆
[2024-08-20T22:32:44] Noname: Same scoot as me
[2024-08-20T22:32:58] haku: ill check it out
[2024-08-20T22:33:10] Noname: Kinda boring I skipped a bit
[2024-08-20T22:33:43] Noname: Just waisting time till Amazon arrives.
[2024-08-20T22:41:02] haku: i dont see any solar charging
[2024-08-20T22:41:30] Noname: He has them but used a portable charger so far
[2024-08-20T22:42:00] Noname: Well a solar charged power bank
[2024-08-20T22:42:15] haku: this guy clickbait. he cant even lift his fallen scooter up.
[2024-08-20T22:42:35] Noname: But charging at friends house because he died. Total scam so far. He had surgery
[2024-08-20T22:43:04] haku: nice to see what eu roads look like though
[2024-08-20T22:43:07] Noname: Need me one of these. When I get some cash
[2024-08-20T22:43:08] haku: so small
[2024-08-20T22:43:49] haku: eu countryside roads so different.
[2024-08-20T22:44:36] Noname: Much like here it's old cart paths.
[2024-08-20T22:44:58] Noname: Only your made up world has big roads that make sense
[2024-08-20T22:45:22] haku: 6lane freeways
[2024-08-20T22:46:46] haku: these country side roads are pretty though. i wonder if i go there they will thank me for liberating them
[2024-08-20T22:47:19] haku: or i will be met with pronoun warriors
[2024-08-20T22:49:33] haku: https://youtu.be/ES5SoEAuJvI?si=3VNIYf9Z8vEa7aB5
[2024-08-20T22:50:07] haku: thats pretty far. phoenix to vegas
[2024-08-20T22:50:07] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-08-20T23:20:31] GABE: @jamessoderstrom it looks like I'm violating the thing
[2024-08-20T23:26:11] haku: balancing?
[2024-08-20T23:27:41] haku: how do you balance p groups with a rc charger? i need to know this
[2024-08-20T23:29:02] GABE: You don't.
[2024-08-20T23:29:14] GABE: The entire P group that makes the series is 3.6v instead of 4v
[2024-08-20T23:29:14] haku: what are you doing then?
[2024-08-20T23:29:34] GABE: so I'm charging the entire p group
[2024-08-20T23:29:59] GABE: It's the same as a smart BMS but external
[2024-08-20T23:30:22] haku: i see. how many p groups can you charge at a time?
[2024-08-20T23:30:34] GABE: You mean S groups.
[2024-08-20T23:30:39] GABE: 6s with this charger
[2024-08-20T23:30:50] GABE: As soon as anything is in parallel it turns into one cell
[2024-08-20T23:31:22] haku: but you charge it all equally yea?
[2024-08-20T23:31:26] GABE: Theoretically infinite.
[2024-08-20T23:31:33] haku: cool
[2024-08-20T23:31:38] GABE: Yes it has to be.
[2024-08-20T23:31:53] GABE: Obviously if the cells were unbalanced in the Parallel stack that wouldn't be too good
[2024-08-20T23:32:02] GABE: like 3.4v + 4.2v
[2024-08-20T23:32:08] haku: cool. thats why i said balancing in the begining
[2024-08-20T23:32:09] GABE: They would technically balance I guess
[2024-08-20T23:32:20] Noname: Get a better bms none of that mah balancing. We need Amps
[2024-08-20T23:32:38] GABE: it's JBD
[2024-08-20T23:32:55] GABE: I just raped it with an external charger
[2024-08-20T23:33:04] GABE: Because it wont balance lol
[2024-08-20T23:33:07] haku: how you do it with a rc charger? i want to learn this
[2024-08-20T23:33:15] Noname: Jk is .6a minimum
[2024-08-20T23:33:33] GABE: It's the exact same as a smart BMS but a cable that goes into it
[2024-08-20T23:33:41] GABE: Nothing is different
[2024-08-20T23:34:03] GABE: Plus to minus
[2024-08-20T23:34:05] GABE: is 1s
[2024-08-20T23:34:08] haku: does your charger have jst connectors too?
[2024-08-20T23:34:13] GABE: Yes.
[2024-08-20T23:34:18] haku: cool
[2024-08-20T23:34:21] GABE: but for 1s you don't need any
[2024-08-20T23:34:27] GABE: which is what I'm doing
[2024-08-20T23:34:33] GABE: otherwise need to solder which I don't wanna do
[2024-08-20T23:34:43] Pandalgns: Hello friends, I have a small problem... today out of nowhere all the parameters of my vesc controller were deconfigured, I tried to do the motor recognition and go back to all the original parameters to see if I could start from scratch but in The app has been left in limited mode and it won't let me touch most of the parameters, which it did before, can someone give me a hand?
[2024-08-20T23:34:50] GABE: so I'm charging each series separately It's just manual torture
[2024-08-20T23:35:58] Noname: Had an active balancer for this but a temp wire popped off or something and it went up in smoke
[2024-08-20T23:36:18] haku: i have a bootleg version of that charger and want to learn it.
[2024-08-20T23:36:35] GABE: Nothing to learn, same as smart BMS
[2024-08-20T23:36:56] GABE: You set it to whatever parameters you want
[2024-08-20T23:37:09] GABE: Bootlegs prone to magiic smoke
[2024-08-20T23:37:32] haku: i have to charge my cells 4 at a time manually to full just to get it to the same voltage
[2024-08-20T23:37:36] GABE: You can charge a lithium ion as LIHV and it will blow
[2024-08-20T23:37:44] GABE: Itll ask you to verify if it's lihv
[2024-08-20T23:37:56] Noname: Why what's your bms capable of
[2024-08-20T23:38:06] haku: no idea
[2024-08-20T23:38:11] Noname: Look
[2024-08-20T23:38:16] GABE: You can do 6 with that charger, but it's limited by amps then because of PSU.
[2024-08-20T23:38:23] GABE: PSU will crash every single time
[2024-08-20T23:38:31] haku: its that ant i burned
[2024-08-20T23:38:38] GABE: I use a Wii u power brick for minee
[2024-08-20T23:38:40] GABE: it's so funny
[2024-08-20T23:39:22] haku: i have a jbd coming for boys bike
[2024-08-20T23:39:38] Noname: OK so what's balance amps?
[2024-08-20T23:39:52] Noname: On that
[2024-08-20T23:39:53] haku: its not here yet. im not sure
[2024-08-20T23:39:57] Noname: Link
[2024-08-20T23:40:02] GABE: you have no lipos so no balance leads lol
[2024-08-20T23:40:06] GABE: so 1s only
[2024-08-20T23:40:35] GABE: cause physically 1s doesnt need any
[2024-08-20T23:40:43] haku: Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! $15.69 | JBD Smart BMS 24V 36V 48V 20A 30A 40A 50A 7S 8S 9S 10S 11S 12S 13S 14S Built-in BT UART Li-ion NMC LiFePo4 Bms Balance Board https://a.aliexpress.com/_mtzLSr2
[2024-08-20T23:41:33] Pandalgns: on my vesc??
[2024-08-20T23:42:35] haku: balance current 20-50ma
[2024-08-20T23:43:21] haku: whatever that means.
[2024-08-20T23:44:23] rosheee: yes

[2024-08-20T23:44:35] rosheee: hold0on
[2024-08-20T23:44:49] rosheee: <animation>
[2024-08-20T23:44:49] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. roscheeee has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-08-20T23:45:49] Noname: Just found it myself lol. Very low balance power
[2024-08-20T23:46:02] Pandalgns: I am updating right now, I am installing the latest version v6.02 for my controller
[2024-08-20T23:46:49] Noname: 2 hundreds of an amp
[2024-08-20T23:47:09] rosheee: 6.05 newest
[2024-08-20T23:47:27] rosheee: newest vesc tool WINDOWS
[2024-08-20T23:47:50] rosheee: newest vesc tool ANDROID
[2024-08-20T23:48:23] Pandalgns: So why do I get v6.02 as the latest firmware version for the controller in the vesc tool?
[2024-08-20T23:48:31] rosheee: newest vesc tool LINUX
[2024-08-20T23:48:37] rosheee: u downloaded 6.05 then updated?
[2024-08-20T23:49:10] Pandalgns: i updated my firm controller with the vesc tool app from my phone
[2024-08-20T23:49:24] rosheee: deinstall the one u have - install this one and SEE MAGIC
[2024-08-20T23:50:09] Pandalgns: i pay 5 euros from an old version?? fuck google store
[2024-08-20T23:50:15] rosheee: rofl 😆
[2024-08-20T23:50:20] rosheee: it's free rofl
[2024-08-20T23:50:27] rosheee: https://vesc-project.com/
[2024-08-20T23:50:40] Pandalgns: in google play cost 5 euros
[2024-08-20T23:50:42] Pandalgns: fuck
[2024-08-20T23:50:59] rosheee: this is whatu pay if never used google or research if u need help me ❤️ to help u 😃 but if u never research (like 99.999999% here did) then vedder'z happy to receive ur 5 euro (i hope it's him xD)
[2024-08-20T23:51:16] haku: with my minibike scoot battery the cells are not all in the same voltage. thinking of cheating and do that rc charging technique
[2024-08-20T23:51:41] haku: some 3.2 some 3.4v
[2024-08-20T23:51:53] haku: but all the same IR
[2024-08-20T23:52:26] rosheee: <animation>
[2024-08-20T23:52:31] haku: i think i can also do it with a powersupply but that be dangerous
[2024-08-20T23:53:05] Pandalgns: The funny thing is that I have an account in the Vesc project.
[2024-08-20T23:53:25] rosheee: https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/
[2024-08-20T23:55:01] Pandalgns: My biggest problem is that I am Spanish and I don't understand much English... I use Google Translate but I barely understand what is being talked about here. I normally try to research what I can but there is little information about vesc in Spanish
[2024-08-20T23:58:23] rosheee: no problem 😊 but download the shizzl i've posted and the try again
[2024-08-20T23:59:58] Noname: Just Weld it leave balance mode on till it's fixed.
[2024-08-21T00:00:39] Pandalgns: I already installed the mobile app and the PC app... I'm testing the mobile app now and it seems to be perfect, what's more, I'm getting firmware version 6.05 for my controller... thank you a million
[2024-08-21T00:01:39] Pandalgns: This is the github of the creator of vesc?
[2024-08-21T00:02:00] rosheee: yas
[2024-08-21T00:04:04] Pandalgns: I understand that the Vedderb github explains well each function and each configuration that can be done in vesc, right?
[2024-08-21T00:05:28] crimeware: <photos/photo_17007@21-08-2024_00-05-28.jpg>
[2024-08-21T00:19:30] 'lekrsu': It's all open source so in a sense, yes?
[2024-08-21T00:19:52] 'lekrsu': The info button in the app is quite useful
[2024-08-21T02:15:02] Noname: Got a GPS speedometer today it's decent for 17$. Just need a volt meter and I'll be all set with gauges no phone needed now.
[2024-08-21T03:00:43] haku: is it precise.
[2024-08-21T03:01:26] Noname: Yeah drove my car with it. Just slightly laggy but bad service here.
[2024-08-21T03:02:28] haku: this the only thing vesc is lacking. i wish more displays available. from CHINA.
[2024-08-21T03:03:58] Noname: For a few dollars you have gauges. Not a big deal. Didn't know about GPS was gonna use a magnet one
[2024-08-21T03:04:46] haku: that trampa display looks awsome but thats equivalent to 5 sacks of rice. choices bro
[2024-08-21T03:05:54] haku: anywho my son started jiujitsu today. im gonna have him wrestle first i think.

[2024-08-21T15:44:14] Yamal: The old generation of Langfeite was of poor quality and rather ugly in my opinion, but this new generation looks solid...
[2024-08-21T16:11:39] yoann tsobanoglou: Are you still running with one vesc?
[2024-08-21T16:12:24] Yamal: Yes ,, 1 controller 1 motor :(

[2024-08-21T16:18:42] Yamal: I don't want any more spares XD, 12 fet solution and let the sun rise wherever it wants
[2024-08-21T16:20:18] yoann tsobanoglou: I also bought spare fets, but finding someone who can solder on alu board is harder than I thought
[2024-08-21T16:49:13] Yamal: here are people in this group who weld the fets with a blindfold and with one leg
[2024-08-21T18:47:06] puneDir: <photos/photo_17015@21-08-2024_18-47-06.jpg>

[2024-08-21T19:00:48] GABE: That was too close, this was the repeat final.
[2024-08-21T19:15:35] GABE: If I didn't have a blunt before that I would probably ended up tearing up in silence lmfao but I kept my ground
[2024-08-21T19:15:58] GABE: but you would not get a whimper from me
[2024-08-21T19:16:25] GABE: No bags no bullshit

[2024-08-21T20:43:34] haku: you can take it to professional rim place for cars.
[2024-08-21T20:48:25] haku: hard to make this things look good. just make it as powerful and fast as you can.

[2024-08-21T21:09:53] haku: i dont think they make 60h split rim
[2024-08-21T21:10:05] haku: not to sure
[2024-08-21T21:12:44] haku: just run it like that. aslong as it still beads
[2024-08-21T21:18:47] puneDir: i dont wanna kill the 60h
[2024-08-21T21:33:22] Yamal: rubber hammer
[2024-08-21T21:35:42] Yamal: You can try hitting it a little, to see if it hopefully turns out a little better, but there are indeed rings, even on Alliespress
[2024-08-21T21:36:32] Yamal: Are they from Nami? or no idea

[2024-08-21T22:14:05] Patrick: @Arne12348868 maybe one of the motors is something for youre g30

[2024-08-22T10:52:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: How do get brake light if I use brake throttle??? (Regen) (Should I use adc v2 for that small of a thing ???)
[2024-08-22T11:01:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: ?

[2024-08-22T11:25:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: If I use adc v2 adapter and run the brake input through and connect my brake light it'll be good but I don't want to use it just for that. It'll take a lot of space and it needs 12v adapter which I forgot to connect to the xt90(but I'll to connect it cuze all my lights rubon 12v )
[2024-08-22T11:25:35] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So...

[2024-08-23T11:21:43] haku: why is it wrapped in tape?
[2024-08-23T11:45:40] GABE: cause I'm lazy
[2024-08-23T11:46:31] haku: what do you mean. takes work to wrap it in tape
[2024-08-23T11:47:49] GABE: Nah not to drill and tap all M4 bolts because I killed every single m3
[2024-08-23T11:48:09] haku: ok. i see lol

[2024-08-23T11:54:14] GABE: don't even care cause I have transport now ill clean it later
[2024-08-23T11:55:43] haku: im not hating on the tape just wondering why its wrapped.
[2024-08-23T11:56:07] haku: i did not know theres no cover
[2024-08-23T11:56:19] GABE: there is a metal sheet under
[2024-08-23T11:56:34] GABE: it's water resistant
[2024-08-23T11:57:20] haku: i like xiaomis actually. just cant find one here

[2024-08-23T11:58:17] 'lekrsu': Drive it there
[2024-08-23T11:58:22] 'lekrsu': dual frame ximi
[2024-08-23T11:58:35] GABE: gave me an idea
[2024-08-23T11:58:46] 'lekrsu': no don't tape another frame to it
[2024-08-23T11:58:55] GABE: Nah fuse 2 frames into one
[2024-08-23T11:59:09] 'lekrsu': It's gon be horrible 😁
[2024-08-23T11:59:09] GABE: and make a new stem and rear adaptation
[2024-08-23T11:59:16] GABE: Not if it's done right

[2024-08-23T14:29:36] GABE: not enough time to fix it now

[2024-08-23T14:51:11] GABE: OMG water got In everywhere. I'm a retard
[2024-08-23T14:51:11] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-08-23T14:56:23] GABE: I think everything is fine, glad I pinpointed the voltage spasm as soon as it happened. If I'm lucky the BMS is OK. ESC is safe, is upside down
[2024-08-23T14:56:36] GABE: Cell is fine, nothing needs redoing.
[2024-08-23T14:56:56] GABE: Yeah, I'll tap the holes now. No cutting corners and being a bum.
[2024-08-23T15:00:51] GABE: I have another BMS anyways.
[2024-08-23T15:08:48] GABE: The Karton box I used to insulate quite literally took in ALL of the moisture.

[2024-08-23T18:14:06] Andrei Albert: Maybe because of kv?
[2024-08-23T18:14:11] 'lekrsu': Is the front touching the tire?

[2024-08-23T18:14:44] puneDir: This part looks like touching but its because of perspectibe
[2024-08-23T18:16:57] Andrei Albert: It is, 24s9P P45B
[2024-08-23T18:17:40] haku: you sure thats 80h? 80h has this bulge on the side. 70h is flat.
[2024-08-23T18:18:26] haku: is has a rounded edge i mean
[2024-08-23T18:22:50] haku: looks good. big tires i like

[2024-08-23T19:43:20] haku: how did you kill it?
[2024-08-23T19:47:02] 'lekrsu': Water
[2024-08-23T19:52:09] Patrick: Hello, so i have the problem some days ago my Flipsky just cutoff and the motor blocked when trying my new observer. First i thought the motor died but after some min of waiting the vesc runs again, wasnt a cutoff from the battery but this is not the question. My question is why the Ble now keeps disconnect once i push down the throttle, turning the motor by hand and settings everything up works perfect but once i push the throttle ble disconnects like in the picture without a error code or something
[2024-08-23T19:52:50] Patrick: It is known to me that flipsky and makerbase are bad controller and randomly die sometimes. I just want to know if there is any way to fix it or if the ble is broken
[2024-08-23T19:54:43] Patrick: Did you wire it according to the wiring diagram?
[2024-08-23T19:59:37] crimeware: Perfect
[2024-08-23T20:01:52] haku: martial arts just a backup strategy when he runs out of ammo for the woke bullies with knives that attack him.

[2024-08-23T20:07:23] haku: what is the axle size/fork opening for that motor?
[2024-08-23T20:08:18] GABE: No this was after
[2024-08-23T20:08:28] 'lekrsu': Still water
[2024-08-23T20:08:31] GABE: I was taking the cell apart fast and a series went loose on the cables
[2024-08-23T20:08:31] GABE: true
[2024-08-23T20:08:35] haku: how it was wrapped
[2024-08-23T20:08:36] GABE: got a spark
[2024-08-23T20:08:39] 'lekrsu': wtf
[2024-08-23T20:08:47] GABE: No idea I WENT OUT IN TTHE RAIN FOR 5 MINUTTES
[2024-08-23T20:08:54] GABE: 5 minutes
[2024-08-23T20:08:54] 'lekrsu': must be the tape
[2024-08-23T20:08:56] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2024-08-23T20:09:03] GABE: Omg
[2024-08-23T20:09:08] GABE: I just killed a G30 BMS
[2024-08-23T20:09:18] GABE: Because they had the same jst
[2024-08-23T20:09:22] GABE: so I just put it in
[2024-08-23T20:09:24] 'lekrsu': Dude
[2024-08-23T20:09:27] GABE: I'm so fucked
[2024-08-23T20:09:35] haku: maybe this is a sign that scooters not for you. your vescs your motor then this?
[2024-08-23T20:09:48] GABE: I don't care about it that much
[2024-08-23T20:09:52] GABE: Shit scooters
[2024-08-23T20:10:14] GABE: I have my last one.
[2024-08-23T20:10:16] haku: get a emoto or a ebike
[2024-08-23T20:10:36] GABE: just a skill issue honestly
[2024-08-23T20:10:36] 'lekrsu': Check voltage beforehand
[2024-08-23T20:11:20] Andrei Albert: 155
[2024-08-23T20:11:52] Andrei Albert: So they fit thunder 2
[2024-08-23T20:11:57] haku: thats 70h. 80h has is more
[2024-08-23T20:12:02] Andrei Albert: Nop
[2024-08-23T20:12:06] Andrei Albert: Theyre custom
[2024-08-23T20:12:14] Andrei Albert: Usually its 170
[2024-08-23T20:12:33] haku: nice. where you get it
[2024-08-23T20:13:12] haku: thats amazing to get 80h to fit a 155mm
[2024-08-23T21:02:53] GABE: Yeah makes sense
[2024-08-23T21:15:07] Andrei Albert: Tires done

[2024-08-23T21:48:17] GABE: Pissed I have to wait, thought.
[2024-08-23T22:51:06] Yamal: how about the scooter
[2024-08-23T22:51:34] GABE: You mean the g30?

[2024-08-23T22:56:48] GABE: All good just need a new low amp BMS
[2024-08-23T22:56:57] GABE: Range was insane today
[2024-08-23T22:58:45] GABE: Range was 50km with the 350w ebike motor, so 250w should bring that up to 60.
[2024-08-23T22:59:12] GABE: Felt like driving a nuclear reactor lol.
[2024-08-23T22:59:17] Yamal: Raphael has 75/80h engines with a 155 short shaft I think I remember 🍰
[2024-08-23T22:59:58] Yamal: Controller ?
[2024-08-23T23:00:14] GABE: The range.
[2024-08-23T23:00:25] GABE: Literally the percentage was not going down at all
[2024-08-23T23:00:32] GABE: 😂
[2024-08-23T23:00:36] Yamal: But what ESC you use
[2024-08-23T23:00:44] GABE: V3.0 xiaomi
[2024-08-23T23:01:02] Paolo ⁭: Not true
[2024-08-23T23:01:43] GABE: Yeah won't be done till November. May as well get 12fets for it. Make it right
[2024-08-23T23:02:20] GABE: Gotta pay back James before I buy anything else as well.
[2024-08-23T23:02:38] GABE: I'm super broke RN Passed exams so will start getting paid in 3 weeks.
[2024-08-23T23:03:53] Yamal: but all this will be for the g30 I imagine
[2024-08-23T23:04:02] Yamal: Nice
[2024-08-23T23:04:35] GABE: I'm already 2k in.
[2024-08-23T23:04:58] GABE: So only 1/3 left. makes me feel better
[2024-08-23T23:06:05] Yamal: I have to wait too, it even makes me want to look for new motors that support more phase, but well the first thing is the electronics to be able to move...
[2024-08-23T23:07:14] Yamal: 75 h would be great
[2024-08-23T23:07:22] GABE: You aren't satisfied with 70h?
[2024-08-23T23:07:24] GABE: Lmao
[2024-08-23T23:07:38] Yamal: I have 60h man
[2024-08-23T23:07:54] GABE: Not insane enough for ya?
[2024-08-23T23:08:02] GABE: Haha
[2024-08-23T23:09:21] Yamal: Yes, the problem is that with 12 fet you have to take the phase very low, and it is like wasting Musk's power
[2024-08-23T23:09:54] GABE: I do not understand
[2024-08-23T23:10:14] haku: my bad. that what i was told by LY. only difference is that bulge
[2024-08-23T23:11:14] haku: i guess you can ask for custom ones. i did not know that
[2024-08-23T23:11:38] GABE: is 250a phase not enough.
[2024-08-23T23:11:40] Yamal: Yes, in terms of temperature everything will be fine, but you can push much more than your motor phase can withstand.
[2024-08-23T23:11:49] GABE: makes sense
[2024-08-23T23:12:01] GABE: Motors are the bottlecap
[2024-08-23T23:12:11] NetworkDir: Moving motor with hand hard or normal ?
[2024-08-23T23:12:22] NetworkDir: I think your mosfets dead
[2024-08-23T23:12:22] GABE: So 12fet is too good
[2024-08-23T23:12:38] Yamal: yes, but with a view to being able to release 400
[2024-08-23T23:17:49] Patrick: Little hard
[2024-08-23T23:17:54] Patrick: And stutters

[2024-08-23T23:52:46] GABE: I saw sparks.
[2024-08-23T23:52:51] GABE: Didn't know what to do
[2024-08-23T23:56:01] 'lekrsu': Balancing then main power
[2024-08-23T23:56:06] haku: atleast you did not put red balance wire to battery -
[2024-08-23T23:56:48] haku: blue man haunting me

[2024-08-24T07:52:06] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Hello, good morning, what welder do you recommend to be able to weld copper to make a battery? We are not going to use it much, it is only to make one or two batteries, nothing professional.
[2024-08-24T07:53:00] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: the one we have is not strong enough
[2024-08-24T07:55:22] haku: kweld is reliable also glitter can do .1

[2024-08-24T07:58:58] haku: look up kweld. eu and US distributer is different and for glitter 801 series from aliexpress.
[2024-08-24T08:00:26] haku: if you need .2 copper and up glitter 811h i have one but do not recommend it.
[2024-08-24T08:01:20] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: We want to make a new battery, the one I have does not work well
[2024-08-24T08:02:08] haku: you can also have an experienced professional battery guy make it from this group. i recommend james if you in eu
[2024-08-24T08:02:27] haku: miro too can do copper
[2024-08-24T08:02:50] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I am in Spain
[2024-08-24T08:03:37] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: All the batteries we have made have been with pure nickel but it cannot solder copper
[2024-08-24T08:03:47] haku: idk ask them @jamessoderstrom @mironoscooter
[2024-08-24T08:04:39] haku: they are battery lords. they know thier stuff

[2024-08-24T09:18:05] haku: guys do you remember of spintend 80/100 comes with anti spark xt90 in the box?
[2024-08-24T09:18:07] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 0.20?
[2024-08-24T09:18:12] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: or refers to 1 mm
[2024-08-24T09:21:19] rosheee: Width of Copper Strip: 7-10 mm Thickness of Copper Strip: 0.2-0.5 mm
[2024-08-24T09:21:41] rosheee: Copper Strip Requirements: Since each cell connection needs to handle only about 45.45 A, the copper strip's size can be significantly smaller than if it were carrying the entire 500 A. Calculating the Required Cross-Section: Using a conservative current density of 2 A/mm² (which is typical for lower voltage, higher current connections): Practical Recommendation: Width of Copper Strip: 7-10 mm Thickness of Copper Strip: 0.2-0.5 mm For cell connections, these dimensions should be sufficient to handle the current without significant heating. It's common to use thinner strips (0.2-0.5 mm) with sufficient width (7-10 mm) to ensure flexibility and ease of installation while safely conducting the required current. Additional Considerations: Multiple Layers: For added current capacity and redundancy, you can use multiple layers of thinner copper strips stacked together. Temperature Management: Ensure proper cooling and avoid excessive lengths of the copper strips to minimize resistance and heating. This setup should be effective for connecting the cells in your battery pack while managing the expected current safely.

[2024-08-24T14:12:14] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/EZmCm4Bn1JU?si=0RJUXJ9QD3fHtWjo
[2024-08-24T14:54:59] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: We have never had any problems even when taking the battery to the discharge limit. We do not use the scooter for racing, we use it for everyday use.
[2024-08-24T14:57:49] Finn: There are several weakpoints. You dont notice it bc you got voltage drop
[2024-08-24T14:58:50] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, of course, but that battery that I put in the photo is not finished, then we reinforce it.
[2024-08-24T14:59:14] Finn: Hm okay. Still not ideal layout for high current
[2024-08-24T14:59:33] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: We are going to make a new one
[2024-08-24T16:01:54] haku: im not good at battery layout. some guys here can help. you do not want weak points like finn said.
[2024-08-24T16:02:40] haku: also you need copper sheets those kinds of layouts.

[2024-08-24T16:08:35] haku: .5 is too thick to weld imo. and you nees more than 10mm
[2024-08-24T16:09:45] haku: if your doing those kinds of layouts you need wide sheets
[2024-08-24T16:10:40] haku: this @AYO744

[2024-08-24T16:47:39] GABE: Literally looks like an escooter from 2120

[2024-08-24T16:48:59] haku: it looks well built. machined aluminum parts
[2024-08-24T16:52:12] haku: remember there is only one lord of the scooters. the g30. 1 scooter to rule them all. 1 scooter to find them. and one scooter to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them
[2024-08-24T16:55:03] Yamal: Well, the truth is that there are models or chassis to prepare that I prefer before the g30, I started with large scooter models and it seems strange to me to move on to small ones...
[2024-08-24T16:56:24] Yamal: I don't want to say that I don't like a G30 with more than 30kw, 700A power and 140 km h, I like it like any other G30 from the group capable of annihilating all the elegant chassis on the market. XD

[2024-08-24T17:32:15] haku: you can nickel steel to make it tougher. paulo does this. direct copper weld
[2024-08-24T17:35:58] GABE: Smaller tyres technically have more acceleration, right?

[2024-08-24T18:05:19] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: ok i understand it would be copper and then a little nickel

[2024-08-24T18:22:09] Noname: Was thinking water cooled for fun. Add a water block under the alum a rad and a dosing pump.
[2024-08-24T18:22:22] Noname: And a heat switch
[2024-08-24T18:23:42] Yamal: What phase amps do you have for battery and motor, by the way you have only one ubox...
[2024-08-24T18:23:55] Noname: It's easy enough to program for me. Enough power for average person and on the shelf have in days. Sold my big Nucular fuck that shit.

[2024-08-24T18:24:40] Yamal: Why not more phase motor ?,,,,

[2024-08-24T18:25:27] Noname: Don't want to melt it
[2024-08-24T18:26:52] Yamal: Well, a motor that supports 300/400A would be good.
[2024-08-24T18:29:46] Noname: I have a 10" rim for my segway but I'm ditching that build. The NIU is 12" but I can get tire to make up size. Need to build a swing arm though. We will see this winter. To many ideas and 1/2 done stuff.
[2024-08-24T18:32:06] Noname: Would be easier to sell and buy the right size but this is a monster
[2024-08-24T18:34:03] Yamal: Wou pretty
[2024-08-24T18:50:01] haku: dam i forgot you had that c80. you have so many pevs bro
[2024-08-24T18:50:23] Noname: Only 3
[2024-08-24T18:50:28] haku: maybe donate some to the needy 😜
[2024-08-24T18:51:26] haku: the economy and inflation is killing me

[2024-08-24T19:53:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Name of scoot ?
[2024-08-24T20:16:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Gpt review: is asked how do I connect brake light to 75200 makerbase here is his answer: You're right; my mistake. Most VESCs, including the Makerbase 75200, do not have a dedicated brake light output. However, you can still wire a brake light by using the VESC's available GPIO pins and configuring it through the VESC Tool software. Here’s how you can do it: ### Steps to Wire a Brake Light to a VESC 75200 1. Identify a GPIO Pin for the Brake Light: - The Makerbase 75200 VESC has several GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) pins that can be configured for various functions, including controlling a brake light. - Refer to the VESC 75200 manual to locate the GPIO pins on the board. You'll need to choose one that can be configured as an output. 2. Prepare the Brake Light: - Use an LED brake light that operates within the voltage range provided by the GPIO pin. Most GPIO pins output 3.3V or 5V, which is usually sufficient for triggering a small LED. 3. Connect the Brake Light to the GPIO Pin: - Connect the positive wire (anode) of the brake light to the chosen GPIO pin on the VESC. - Connect the negative wire (cathode) of the brake light to a ground (GND) pin on the VESC. 4. Configure the GPIO Pin in VESC Tool: - Connect your VESC to your computer using a USB cable. - Open the VESC Tool software and connect to your VESC. - Go to the "App Settings" section, then navigate to the "General" tab. - Find the section for GPIO configuration. Set the chosen GPIO pin to "Output" and configure it to activate when braking. - Save and write the configuration to the VESC. 5. Test the Brake Light: - Once the configuration is complete, test the brake light by applying the brakes on your VESC-powered vehicle. - The brake light should illuminate when the brake is engaged. 6. Secure the Wiring: - Use electrical tape or heat shrink tubing to secure the connections and protect them from moisture and vibration. - Route the wires neatly along the frame to prevent them from getting caught or damaged. ### Additional Tips: - Use a Relay for Higher Power Lights: If you want to use a more powerful brake light that requires more current than the GPIO pin can safely supply, use the GPIO pin to trigger a relay, which can then power the brake light from a separate power source. - Safety First: Always ensure your VESC is powered off and disconnected from any power source while making electrical connections to avoid shorts or accidental damage. By following these steps, you should be able to successfully add a brake light to your VESC 75200 setup. Let me know if you have any further questions or need more detailed instructions!
[2024-08-24T20:17:30] Finn: For delta use?
[2024-08-24T20:25:55] Maximus Brokus: Bro be patient, couldnt just wait 10 minutes
[2024-08-24T20:26:28] Maximus Brokus: If you use an ignition switch on the vesc you could just wire the light to 5v, than its just always on
[2024-08-24T20:26:53] 'lekrsu': Make sure to add a resistor if needed
[2024-08-24T20:35:58] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I need a brake light not running light bro
[2024-08-24T20:36:16] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yep I know that
[2024-08-24T20:38:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: He should have say make sure to ask someone else if needed haha (no but now on a Sirius note how do I do that without using adc v2 adapter????? and 2 more problems Im now on dual and brake light needs 12v )
[2024-08-24T20:39:39] 'lekrsu': Put a resistor in series and check brightness
[2024-08-24T20:40:02] 'lekrsu': If led doesn't have one it'll request infinite
[2024-08-24T20:40:02] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: In series to what bro ?
[2024-08-24T20:40:08] 'lekrsu': To limit current
[2024-08-24T20:40:48] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Vesc(mine at least) doesn't have brake light output
[2024-08-24T20:41:58] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: All of this fro brake light ? I'll just use adc v2 (my problem is that now I will need to split connections like input for each vesc)
[2024-08-24T20:42:37] cihan: I have questions about holding cells together. Can cell insulation withstand 180 celcius hot melt glue? Is neutral silicone enough to hold cells together for making a battery?
[2024-08-24T20:46:05] 'lekrsu': Hmm, idk.
[2024-08-24T20:52:43] Noname: Rated for 14kw but qs can take double
[2024-08-24T20:53:31] Noname: You think I have extra money?
[2024-08-24T20:54:50] Noname: Hot glue for tacking togeather it'll get gooey and battery can shift. Also it doesn't stick well to cold cells, Just snapps
[2024-08-24T20:55:25] Noname: Who has room for that
[2024-08-24T20:56:09] Noname: Wish I didn't buy it. Won't fit NIU either need to build a swing arm and I'd rather not
[2024-08-24T20:59:00] Noname: Haku-Depot home of the handyman

[2024-08-24T21:29:17] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: When you heat it, put that part down against the ground.
[2024-08-24T21:29:39] haku: good idea. i just let it be
[2024-08-24T21:30:11] haku: oh well it will be incased in a 3d printed box anyways.
[2024-08-24T21:30:27] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: heat it up again nothing happens
[2024-08-24T21:30:41] haku: no it just hardens
[2024-08-24T21:31:24] haku: the wrap is too big imo
[2024-08-24T21:33:11] haku: lessons learned today. do not cut + and - at the same time while bms is on. got it.
[2024-08-24T21:35:08] haku: lessons learned yesterday and last week do not wire bms backwards. got it
[2024-08-24T21:35:31] Rose: Hey there Hans-Albert, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-08-24T21:36:15] Tristan: After I have now contacted Sannio and Mirono privately, some misunderstandings and a lot of information have been clarified on my part. I was told complete bullshit from my client and had a wrong picture of the two. Mirono admitted making mistakes when building the shown battery. I can assure you that the other batteries, or current batteries, are definitely good in terms of quality. I apologize to them both for causing stress. They are very nice guys! :)
[2024-08-24T21:38:16] Yamal: Velity
[2024-08-24T21:39:17] haku: thanks for clariffying. im representing my client miro. he is inoccent of all charges. if more questions email antiwoke.lawfirm@blueman.com
[2024-08-24T21:51:16] cihan: I'll be using thermoplastic with higher melting temlerature like 180-190 degrees. I read they start to get soft at about 80-90 degrees so I thought they're safe to use and won't get soft during use but I'm concerned about harming insulation and also harming cell's with high temperature.
[2024-08-24T21:54:31] cihan: Yes, that's best option but not very usable with large foils with the type of cell holder I had. However there's another reason why I want to use hot melt glue. I can fit 6P without problem. I didn't check yet but If I could just sandpaper the deck inside I could be able to fit 7P and that's going to be great. Maybe it won't be 7P but I can say the battery will have about 16-19 more cells which is great.
[2024-08-24T21:54:58] cihan: That's best option without question and very solid.

[2024-08-24T22:02:07] Forol1561: elon only made it worse...... I was so hyped for it for YEARS but since that dumbass rushed it since it was behind schedule.... they shipped out a non functional untested prototypes basically....
[2024-08-24T22:06:42] haku: not really dumb for selling it. if its that bad people wont buy it. tesla is a great car company. same as the old version teslas they suck now they are polished and refined

[2024-08-25T17:14:22] Pandalgns: Guys, a question, to connect two controllers per can that connects white cable to white and black cable to black or the other way around?
[2024-08-25T17:17:52] Pandalgns: And when it comes to configuring them connected by can, I only have to configure the main one and the secondary one, copy the parameters, right? And finally, I have to put half the value of the battery, right? For example, my battery is 60A, would I have to set it to 30A so that each controller demands a maximum of 30A, right?

[2024-08-26T17:14:09] GABE: Small motors heat up too much to only use ebrake and no mech
[2024-08-26T17:14:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I was running the scot only Regen (45a) with a 800w motor
[2024-08-26T17:14:36] GABE: minimotor

[2024-08-26T17:15:09] GABE: Worked so well I didn't use brakes for months
[2024-08-26T17:15:29] GABE: Fine if you limit how much you brake tho
[2024-08-26T17:15:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But I have small mantis motor and no rear brake

[2024-08-26T17:20:18] Medhi Cantin: Hi, do you know how to spread the bullet without scratching the inside?
[2024-08-26T17:21:28] Medhi Cantin: I find these connections too easy to remove
[2024-08-26T17:23:20] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: With some hard plastic I could do it.
[2024-08-26T17:24:04] Medhi Cantin: Okay, I get it 👍
[2024-08-26T17:34:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Hope that is the issue

[2024-08-26T17:34:50] GABE: twice maybe
[2024-08-26T17:35:11] 'lekrsu': Or use other connectors, few cents
[2024-08-26T17:35:17] GABE: Bullets r cheapest
[2024-08-26T17:35:30] GABE: and I argue cleaner
[2024-08-26T17:35:46] GABE: looks sexier inside
[2024-08-26T17:35:55] 'lekrsu': I do like how the plastic clips in place

[2024-08-26T17:40:04] 'lekrsu': Most batteries aren't made for it either

[2024-08-26T22:47:27] Pandalgns: Probably have bad wheel diameter at the secondary vesc?
[2024-08-26T22:47:57] Pandalgns: 😂😂 no problem... only see main vesc 😂😂😂

[2024-08-27T15:38:02] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If the controller is placed in an aluminum box between the controller and the aluminum, it would have to have a 0.5 pack. If it is thicker, it does not dissipate heat well and would heat up instead of cooling.

[2024-08-27T20:10:34] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And we have a problem we have a local distributor that charge huge prices
[2024-08-27T20:10:56] NetworkDir: You can't buy from james?
[2024-08-27T20:11:05] NetworkDir: Custom or post problems?
[2024-08-27T20:11:15] haku: tesla is like the g30 of evs. or the 90s corolla
[2024-08-27T20:11:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's not dual (I think)
[2024-08-27T20:11:38] NetworkDir: Yes but you can but 2x and connect via can
[2024-08-27T20:11:55] NetworkDir: Also why you want 75200 Your phase current +180A ?
[2024-08-27T20:12:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Too expensive
[2024-08-27T20:12:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No
[2024-08-27T20:12:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But that is what I had before

[2024-08-27T20:13:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Why not one vesc dual motor
[2024-08-27T20:13:23] NetworkDir: More heat
[2024-08-27T20:14:37] Ric.R.M: If you press the left and right buttons at the same time, it activates reverse. Almost finished the project after 9 months of building. :)
[2024-08-27T20:16:27] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But if I'll buy you will help me set up ?
[2024-08-27T20:16:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm not familiar with spintend
[2024-08-27T20:17:03] NetworkDir: Mostly same with flipsky makerbase
[2024-08-27T20:17:15] 'lekrsu': Dual means two Vescs.
[2024-08-27T20:17:16] NetworkDir: At all james and me and spintend users will help you
[2024-08-27T20:19:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm tired of losing money on this I just lost 2 75200 and like 500$ on set up
[2024-08-27T20:19:39] NetworkDir: Me too i lose money for makerbase
[2024-08-27T20:19:59] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Bro I make 600$ a month now
[2024-08-27T20:20:17] NetworkDir: Ah
[2024-08-27T20:20:32] 'lekrsu': You can't run two motors on one controller
[2024-08-27T20:21:59] NetworkDir: Some ubox models available with 2 controllers bundled on 1 cass
[2024-08-27T20:22:28] 'lekrsu': Costs double, literally the case of one, twice.
[2024-08-27T20:22:36] GABE: lmao
[2024-08-27T20:28:05] Jeferson Rodriguez: What version should I download from the .bin?
[2024-08-27T20:28:05] Jeferson Rodriguez: I've tried several and they don't work.
[2024-08-27T20:28:09] haku: its true. thats why alot of people have it in my city. tesla use to be very expensive in 2016 now its pretty affordable because you get alot of government incentives to get an ev.
[2024-08-27T20:33:16] haku: only good thing this current administration has done tbh
[2024-08-27T20:35:53] NetworkDir: it's makerbase or flipsky?

[2024-08-27T21:29:27] Face de Pin Sucé: I experience a puncture every 3weeks approximately with my speedway leger single motor 8KW 8.5inch
[2024-08-27T21:30:08] Face de Pin Sucé: Today I test solid tyre (very soft one, managed to put in half rim) cross fingers that it will handle the torque
[2024-08-27T21:31:02] Face de Pin Sucé: Tried everything possible
[2024-08-27T21:31:15] haku: my vsett always flat too

[2024-08-27T21:32:41] Face de Pin Sucé: Even tried the semi offroad 8.5inch, 3 weeks and no rubber in the center x)
[2024-08-27T21:32:48] Face de Pin Sucé: 😂
[2024-08-27T21:34:13] haku: is it difficult to put a solid tire on a g30 motor?
[2024-08-27T21:34:24] Andrei Albert: Not quite
[2024-08-27T21:34:27] haku: never done it
[2024-08-27T21:34:45] haku: just boil for 15mins and install yea?
[2024-08-27T21:34:51] Andrei Albert: Microwave that thing
[2024-08-27T21:34:53] Andrei Albert: Or boil it
[2024-08-27T21:34:56] Andrei Albert: :))
[2024-08-27T21:35:24] haku: i just dont hava a vice to hold the motor
[2024-08-27T21:35:45] Andrei Albert: U need only 2 levers
[2024-08-27T21:35:56] Andrei Albert: Motor on the ground and thats it
[2024-08-27T21:36:06] Andrei Albert: And some force:))

[2024-08-27T21:36:25] Andrei Albert: And ifc soapy wataar
[2024-08-27T21:36:45] Face de Pin Sucé: Last time, they exploded at full speed, I'm trying to see if I'm too lazy to change them before it happens or not x)
[2024-08-27T21:37:16] Face de Pin Sucé: It's rear, so not a big deal if it happens
[2024-08-27T21:37:34] haku: your 8.5 inch motor will fit a vsett 9?
[2024-08-27T21:40:07] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, it's the same we use also on G30 with 10inch, or dualtrons 10inch
[2024-08-27T21:40:22] Face de Pin Sucé: If you have 125mm fork opening is okay
[2024-08-27T21:45:19] haku: has anyone used one of these? Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! $13.81 | Ebike Controller Box Case Kit Dust-proof Waterproof Hot Sale For Battery Controller Extra-Large Conversion PartAccessories https://a.aliexpress.com/_mqo7uVi

[2024-08-27T22:15:04] haku: she was like the brittney spears equivalent of france but much hotter
[2024-08-27T22:15:52] Yamal: 😳
[2024-08-27T22:29:19] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, it doesn't handle the torque :'( Had a big drift at 45Kmh while reaccelerating x)
[2024-08-27T22:39:37] haku: thats a good idea
[2024-08-27T22:39:47] haku: like tractor tires
[2024-08-27T22:40:16] haku: split rim would be a pain though unless tape the middle part

[2024-08-28T02:44:05] haku: yes. the old solid tire wasnt the right size and the bead is off

[2024-08-28T03:54:28] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I want to try getting 2 75100 instead but I don't think I used the same amps on rear but In front 75100 would be enough so or 2 75200/100 or one of each
[2024-08-28T03:55:11] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also how do I connect to a logic board that is disconnected from power stage ?
[2024-08-28T04:01:59] haku: my guess is switzerlandia
[2024-08-28T04:03:07] haku: still need to change my vsett tube. i forgot about that task
[2024-08-28T04:06:43] Izuna 生活: I never used vsett motor or Flipsky controller what
[2024-08-28T04:07:04] Izuna 生活: I have been using the 60h 22x3 since the beginning of the project
[2024-08-28T04:07:35] Izuna 生活: and for the ESCs, well started with MP2, then had MKS 75100 during winter season and now back to MP2 x 84100HP
[2024-08-28T04:11:50] haku: does this mean the motor can handle 70phase?
[2024-08-28T04:13:00] haku: im sure its less than that. what does this mean?
[2024-08-28T05:32:11] haku: how do you measure the exact distance of the holes on where to mount it.
[2024-08-28T05:36:21] haku: anyone has an stl file for the guide holes?
[2024-08-28T05:48:15] haku: is this m2.5 screw?
[2024-08-28T05:48:15] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-08-28T05:51:49] Yamal: Almost finish g30ebike!
[2024-08-28T05:53:30] haku: almost. dam spintend does not include mounting hardware. 😭
[2024-08-28T05:55:12] Yamal: spintend collection
[2024-08-28T05:55:58] Yamal: you need the 2 in 1 purple! for your collection
[2024-08-28T05:56:01] haku: this 80/100 i think is m2.5 if thats even a real screw size
[2024-08-28T05:56:31] Yamal: but what do you need, screws?
[2024-08-28T05:57:49] haku: to mount it to this bigger case so wires wont be dangling around.
[2024-08-28T05:57:49] haku: <photos/photo_17187@28-08-2024_05-57-49.jpg>
[2024-08-28T05:59:22] Yamal: How do you attach the box to the bike?
[2024-08-28T06:00:08] Yamal: that you want to place it under the seat
[2024-08-28T06:15:31] haku: yes over the seat. this will also be the on and off switch and all the other wires will be crammed in.
[2024-08-28T06:17:58] Yamal: I see you on the minibike every day going to buy bread! XD
[2024-08-28T06:18:42] haku: oh yes. i will be using it "for testing purposes" only 😂
[2024-08-28T06:20:25] Yamal: you keep the chassis of the g30?
[2024-08-28T06:21:04] haku: yep
[2024-08-28T06:22:27] haku: i keep everything yamal. everything
[2024-08-28T06:25:24] haku: i want it to be mounted this way.
[2024-08-28T06:25:56] haku: battery in the scooter bag infront. not alot of space
[2024-08-28T06:44:49] Yamal: You have to protect the battery well against possible falls….
[2024-08-28T06:47:22] haku: i have no choice but to mount it in a bag to make it all fit easy. or i need to design some cad stuff to make it work
[2024-08-28T06:49:46] Yamal: Which accelerator have you chosen?
[2024-08-28T06:55:37] haku: ali thumb throttle
[2024-08-28T06:56:31] haku: if i can fix my spinny that would be best for him since its easier to regen than using brake handles
[2024-08-28T06:58:03] Noname: Again you can have my gen1
[2024-08-28T07:07:51] Yamal: Throttle for trotinette
[2024-08-28T07:08:11] Yamal: Don’t like ebrake….
[2024-08-28T07:08:17] haku: thanks. lets see how this plays out. if he can brake properly
[2024-08-28T07:08:37] haku: hes on the spectrum like me
[2024-08-28T07:09:22] Noname: Can't you set up when throttle is off brakes go on?
[2024-08-28T07:09:26] haku: but im more of the retarded side not the smart side
[2024-08-28T07:09:46] haku: oh thats right. i think you can with vesc
[2024-08-28T07:14:15] haku: i like ebrake actually.
[2024-08-28T07:14:50] haku: my car does it automatically when you get your foot off the pedal
[2024-08-28T07:15:19] Yamal: Many controllers have been seen to break because of this, I prefer to use brake pads
[2024-08-28T07:15:38] haku: really maybe above 20s for spintend
[2024-08-28T07:16:30] haku: vesc lords said 20s is okay for 84/200 i think
[2024-08-28T07:17:04] haku: even 21s i think its okay
[2024-08-28T07:21:30] haku: Noname this bit is it suppose to spin to the right or left? when i spin it to the left the bit comes off.
[2024-08-28T07:26:13] puneDir: Are you happy with 84100s?
[2024-08-28T07:30:46] Yamal: Izuna is scary with his scooter, he drives everyone crazy with his speed, there is no one who can catch up with him 😂
[2024-08-28T07:31:12] Yamal: MoliMoli 🤙⚡️🚣‍♂️
[2024-08-28T07:40:01] Yamal: with him it has also been the first time I heard of carrying 2 different vesc controllers for the same scooter,,,
[2024-08-28T08:10:10] Jason: lol
[2024-08-28T08:10:46] Jason: mmmmm
[2024-08-28T08:11:47] haku: ?

[2024-08-28T09:06:58] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: @SibClimb Hello, good morning, could you look at the private message I sent you last week
[2024-08-28T09:39:07] Mir Aman Bahner: How could this be fixed?
[2024-08-28T10:02:06] Yamal: @Bradhaku
[2024-08-28T10:23:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: @jamessoderstrom u have a store don't u ? Give link
[2024-08-28T10:29:25] David: Where mby thé motor ?
[2024-08-28T10:42:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Guys used like new 330$ worth it ?
[2024-08-28T10:42:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_17192@28-08-2024_10-42-29.jpg>
[2024-08-28T10:42:48] Yamal: Why not 85/150?
[2024-08-28T10:43:16] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No shipping to my area since official importer
[2024-08-28T10:43:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And official is too expensive
[2024-08-28T10:46:44] David: This error
[2024-08-28T10:48:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: For
[2024-08-28T10:49:01] GABE: Na says Never ever ever use more than 85v on that
[2024-08-28T10:49:08] GABE: i mean if you have money then do experiment
[2024-08-28T10:59:57] FreehandZ: right i think
[2024-08-28T11:00:16] FreehandZ: look at which way the teeth are pointing
[2024-08-28T11:00:28] FreehandZ: and the direction of the drill bit spiral
[2024-08-28T11:07:45] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: That piece has to turn in the direction of the teeth, if it turns the other way it would be very difficult to make the hole
[2024-08-28T11:30:07] Rogerio Figueiredo: Mp2?
[2024-08-28T11:37:26] Ric.R.M: https://youtube.com/shorts/NSIB8DMjjv0?si=GmiYvjwX6BpvLpds
[2024-08-28T11:37:33] Rogerio Figueiredo: Nice witch motores is that?
[2024-08-28T11:38:05] Rogerio Figueiredo: Why do you change to 75100 on winter and get back to mp2
[2024-08-28T11:40:58] Rogerio Figueiredo: Can you get more speed with Mp2?
[2024-08-28T11:41:38] Mir Aman Bahner: I am new but perhaps you have set minimum voltage parameter too low?
[2024-08-28T11:51:24] Yamal: OzunAAHH unstoppable! I'm telling you!
[2024-08-28T11:54:48] GABE: Skill.
[2024-08-28T11:57:25] FreehandZ: Calipers?
[2024-08-28T12:39:20] Patrick: Not that hard, but there is also a drawing of the holes on the spintend website

[2024-08-28T13:11:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_17192@28-08-2024_10-42-29.jpg>
[2024-08-28T13:11:28] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The 100/100
[2024-08-28T13:11:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Black edition
[2024-08-28T13:15:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'll add some details on my setup 60v 28ah 200peak ant bms 80 continues dual motor one is mantis10 motor and one Zero10x motor
[2024-08-28T13:15:24] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Shlomozero10 has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-08-28T13:30:55] haku: just heating issues. its really hot where im from and mounted it without thermal paste
[2024-08-28T13:31:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Will mount with fan and paste
[2024-08-28T13:31:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But any more issues?
[2024-08-28T13:31:44] haku: paste should be fine if mounted to the frame
[2024-08-28T13:32:33] haku: it has other issues i think but cooling was my only one
[2024-08-28T13:33:19] haku: i was only using 50a battery per side
[2024-08-28T13:46:49] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Will do the same
[2024-08-28T13:47:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What are the others
[2024-08-28T13:48:13] haku: im not sure.
[2024-08-28T13:48:57] haku: spintend stopped selling it too
[2024-08-28T14:03:16] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What are selling?
[2024-08-28T14:03:23] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And whare ?
[2024-08-28T14:13:27] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Do u ave website?
[2024-08-28T14:17:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ship to Israel?
[2024-08-28T14:18:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What are your prices and what vescs do u hold
[2024-08-28T14:19:48] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I pay taxes if order from Ali
[2024-08-28T14:22:47] Paolo ⁭: Is Asia
[2024-08-28T14:27:35] El: No
[2024-08-28T14:27:48] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But do fallow some eu rules
[2024-08-28T14:28:51] El: Tax like every non eu countries
[2024-08-28T14:39:47] Ric.R.M: Hello everyone. My VESC died after 3 days, 2 MOSFETs... Is the VESC really that fragile? This is the first time I'm using a VESC controller.
[2024-08-28T14:41:30] Paolo ⁭: What vesc? Flipsky ?
[2024-08-28T14:45:31] GABE: less fragile than any other esc.
[2024-08-28T14:48:51] El: If more then 75$
[2024-08-28T15:01:58] Noname: To the Right like 99% of drill bits
[2024-08-28T15:04:05] Noname: I have my regen high enough to toss you over the bars at full speed. A Lil kid going 5mph should be fine.
[2024-08-28T15:47:14] Noname: https://www.facebook.com/share/r/rEpZ46dA2J2G4gMp/?mibextid=D5vuiz

[2024-08-28T15:58:43] Izuna 生活: Ofc lol
[2024-08-28T15:58:50] Izuna 生活: It's twice as powerful
[2024-08-28T16:02:44] Ric.R.M: I bought it for €130 on AliExpress. It lasted 3 days. Do you have any idea how to desolder the MOSFETs?
[2024-08-28T16:04:46] Ric.R.M: <photos/photo_17196@28-08-2024_16-04-46.jpg>
[2024-08-28T16:06:15] 'lekrsu': Why dont you say what you bought
[2024-08-28T16:08:41] GABE: bought what
[2024-08-28T16:08:44] 'lekrsu': https://www.lcsc.com/datasheet/lcsc_datasheet_2203031730_HUAYI-HYG015N10NS1TA_C2979263.pdf
[2024-08-28T16:11:27] Ric.R.M: vesc
[2024-08-28T16:11:37] Paolo ⁭: I guess is flipsky no?
[2024-08-28T16:11:48] Paolo ⁭: Hahaha makerbase
[2024-08-28T16:11:49] 'lekrsu': Just say the model next time.
[2024-08-28T16:12:01] 'lekrsu': Saying VESC is like saying "I drive car"
[2024-08-28T16:12:21] Paolo ⁭: Not vesc fragile, but if you buy super cheap controller with recycled or stolen parts how you pretend to have good controller
[2024-08-28T16:13:33] Ric.R.M: Sorry, I'm Portuguese, and my English is a bit weak.
[2024-08-28T16:13:54] Paolo ⁭: Is likely to say "android is shit" after you tried Ulephone , but there's phone like Samsung s24
[2024-08-28T16:23:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Look it's not smart to say flipsky is shit and not help some people don't have money to burn ubox controller or makerx and a like
[2024-08-28T16:24:13] 'lekrsu': It already burned however.
[2024-08-28T16:24:24] GABE: Ay guys we are going off the rails.
[2024-08-28T16:24:27] GABE: guy needs help
[2024-08-28T16:31:41] Ric.R.M: I heated it to 500° plus hot air at 500°, and it doesn't come off easily... everything burns out first.
[2024-08-28T16:35:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Or just the stove ahah
[2024-08-28T16:35:27] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_17198@28-08-2024_16-35-27.jpg>
[2024-08-28T16:35:55] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: https://www.makerx-tech.com/collections/x-esc/products/go-foc-d100s
[2024-08-28T16:36:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Comparable to spintend 100/100?
[2024-08-28T16:43:04] Ric.R.M: And how are you going to put it back? Everything will become fragile with so much heat!
[2024-08-28T16:47:25] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: On low setting
[2024-08-28T16:48:21] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So what do I do ? Bult it to the scooter?
[2024-08-28T16:50:58] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Paste fan and bolt will be ok ?
[2024-08-28T16:51:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_17199@28-08-2024_16-51-31.jpg>
[2024-08-28T16:52:25] Rogerio Figueiredo: So why do you trade them for the 75100?
[2024-08-28T16:53:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Aaaa shell
[2024-08-28T16:53:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: How is the 75200 is Alu PCB and this not
[2024-08-28T16:54:58] Ric.R.M: I think the PCB is aluminum, even the cheap ones are.
[2024-08-28T16:58:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What do u meaning fragile?
[2024-08-28T16:59:51] Ric.R.M: Too much heat to be able to solder all the components without damaging anything!
[2024-08-28T17:02:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: How do I know when I damaged some ?
[2024-08-28T17:03:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I tried with a soldering iron and a blower and not worked
[2024-08-28T17:04:06] Ric.R.M: Anything soldered at more than 360° for more than 10 seconds gets damaged. That's my opinion.
[2024-08-28T17:26:58] GABE: depends on tip size, more 360° is worse
[2024-08-28T17:27:13] GABE: Mini tip at 400 usually doesnt damage if you aren't an idiot
[2024-08-28T17:27:43] GABE: I use 450 with a big tip for disconnecting BMS and shit
[2024-08-28T17:27:51] GABE: otherwise it'll never come off for me.
[2024-08-28T17:32:45] David: 60v cut off
[2024-08-28T17:42:31] 'lekrsu': Depends what you're soldering
[2024-08-28T17:42:57] 'lekrsu': Wires? 400C is nice. An SMD resistor at 400C would disintegrate.
[2024-08-28T17:44:34] GABE: 300 max for short periods and letting it cool down after every failure to solder/unsolder
[2024-08-28T17:45:04] GABE: for non leaded
[2024-08-28T17:45:16] GABE: goes up to 480 acc
[2024-08-28T17:46:51] Rose: Hey there Genny, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-08-28T18:39:09] 'lekrsu': Rarely melts below 350 so I usually stay there
[2024-08-28T18:51:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Does someone have this on his scot

[2024-08-28T20:02:37] puneDir: Its fine
[2024-08-28T20:02:43] puneDir: Im waiting for escs
[2024-08-28T20:03:05] Yamal: But you really have before ,,?
[2024-08-28T20:03:12] Yamal: 84100,,?
[2024-08-28T20:03:17] puneDir: Yes
[2024-08-28T20:03:23] puneDir: My old escs were 84100s
[2024-08-28T20:04:25] Yamal: as You showed 2 new ones recently I thought it was for the zero
[2024-08-28T20:07:53] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Bro i don't know what to do 😭
[2024-08-28T20:08:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I need advice I want new vescs
[2024-08-28T20:08:51] Yamal: It was for a zero too, right?
[2024-08-28T20:08:58] puneDir: Yes theyre for zero
[2024-08-28T20:09:34] Yamal: budget vs availability

[2024-08-28T20:18:34] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Just for them to die again ?
[2024-08-28T20:19:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What caused it I think it's a bms cut off (bms80a and every vesc was on 50a battery)
[2024-08-28T20:20:20] haku: alot of those on off city interstate roads
[2024-08-28T20:31:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: How are they ?
[2024-08-28T20:32:33] puneDir: Good

[2024-08-28T20:37:22] puneDir: 100 is not possible with zero cuz geometry
[2024-08-28T20:37:25] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I more care about acceleration

[2024-08-28T22:42:58] 'lekrsu': How high does the temps go?
[2024-08-28T22:43:05] Andrei Albert: 90
[2024-08-28T22:43:09] Andrei Albert: 87
[2024-08-28T22:43:10] Pandalgns: Wow... u are the REAL CRAZY
[2024-08-28T22:43:14] 'lekrsu': My Ubox runs 30C 😁
[2024-08-28T22:43:36] Andrei Albert: They still run tho, in my friend scoot
[2024-08-28T22:44:47] Andrei Albert: Back in the days

[2024-08-28T22:46:41] Pandalgns: How many amps can resist that?? 😈😈🔥🔥🔥
[2024-08-28T22:49:33] Andrei Albert: 300 km range:)))
[2024-08-28T22:49:47] Yamal: Have you put caps on the capacitors?
[2024-08-28T22:50:00] Andrei Albert: Idk, you have to find out🤪
[2024-08-28T22:50:02] Yamal: Wait
[2024-08-28T22:51:28] Pandalgns: Yes becouse the controlers are infront 1 to other 1 and i dont like if the capacitors tuoch
[2024-08-28T22:51:31] Pandalgns: 😂😂
[2024-08-28T22:51:34] Pandalgns: Kaboom
[2024-08-28T22:51:37] Давно пора: How many wh?
[2024-08-28T22:51:40] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_17230@28-08-2024_22-51-40.jpg>
[2024-08-28T22:52:16] Andrei Albert: 60V 105Ah
[2024-08-28T22:52:31] Давно пора: 👍
[2024-08-28T22:53:19] haku: all the battery on the deck with that spacer or in the bag?
[2024-08-28T22:53:31] Andrei Albert: 2 in the deck
[2024-08-28T22:53:37] Andrei Albert: One in the bag
[2024-08-28T22:53:50] Andrei Albert: 3 thunder 1 batts
[2024-08-28T22:55:01] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-08-28T22:57:00] haku: what is that? suspensuon fork looks beefy
[2024-08-28T22:57:35] Yamal: 105ah
[2024-08-28T22:58:22] Yamal: Currus panther suspension
[2024-08-28T22:58:52] haku: 11" tire?
[2024-08-28T22:59:05] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 150ah ?
[2024-08-28T22:59:19] Yamal: The currus actually 130 about i thing ? @Josekass
[2024-08-28T23:00:06] Andrei Albert: 105
[2024-08-28T23:04:05] haku: luckily spintend selling just the pcb for the spinny but shipping is still alot for such a small thing.
[2024-08-28T23:04:54] haku: total would be $40 bucks. that a good price you guys think?
[2024-08-28T23:06:55] Pandalgns: I have a problem guys, from one moment to the next my controllers stopped recognizing each other by can and now when I connect one to the app I don't get the other one in can, what could it be?
[2024-08-28T23:08:16] 'lekrsu': Did you recently touch adc settings?
[2024-08-28T23:13:28] haku: thats 2 sacks of rice.
[2024-08-28T23:13:42] Pandalgns: No, before I connected them and accelerated and everything worked fine, but I changed the accelerator parameter instead of current to duty and it started to go wrong, and they stopped working by cannon, if I tried them separately they still worked perfectly but when I connected them one to another others are not recognized and only one works
[2024-08-28T23:14:18] Pandalgns: U know whats up?? 😭😭 pls help
[2024-08-28T23:14:20] Pandalgns: 😂😂
[2024-08-28T23:15:54] 'lekrsu': When you're in the adc tab, swapping between vescs won't correctly do the 'read' for you every time, allowing a 'write' with the wrong vesc id.
[2024-08-28T23:16:41] 'lekrsu': Seen it be incorrect quite a few times yesterday
[2024-08-28T23:17:05] 'lekrsu': Very inconsistent, read works though 😁
[2024-08-28T23:19:22] 'lekrsu': How are you cooling these?
[2024-08-28T23:21:24] Pandalgns: The little that I tried, they barely heat up to 35 degrees or so, but I don't have a cooling system.
[2024-08-28T23:23:09] haku: thats the alu pcb makerbase yea?
[2024-08-28T23:24:23] 'lekrsu': Interesting
[2024-08-28T23:24:45] Pandalgns: Yep
[2024-08-28T23:24:48] Pandalgns: 84100hp
[2024-08-28T23:30:50] Pandalgns: Dont work
[2024-08-28T23:30:52] Pandalgns: 😭😭
[2024-08-28T23:32:37] Pandalgns: I try to change id at the 2 vesc but dont work
[2024-08-28T23:32:38] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Pandalgns has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-08-28T23:38:03] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: @punedir i can see that it says on the 84100 antenna does it have built in Bluetooth?
[2024-08-28T23:38:53] Pandalgns: Yes
[2024-08-28T23:41:20] haku: how do you lower the nami? nami on the left it looks lowered
[2024-08-28T23:45:09] Yamal: with shorter suspensions, even though people who compete put aluminum or steel bars instead of suspension but it is not ideal, 165mm is what it comes from the factory
[2024-08-28T23:49:06] haku: in competition the completely remove it to make it stiffer? thats smart
[2024-08-28T23:50:05] haku: makes sense. track race cars have stiff suspension too
[2024-08-28T23:51:18] Yamal: lower, the suspensions, even if it is a little, it is always good to have them...
[2024-08-28T23:54:43] haku: does that have a big effect on handling turns?
[2024-08-28T23:55:56] haku: these race guys have a crazy turning lean angle.
[2024-08-28T23:56:25] haku: i tried it on my vsett. cant do it
[2024-08-28T23:58:42] Finn: Maybe buy rice instead
[2024-08-28T23:59:54] haku: thats right. its tonight
[2024-08-29T00:00:18] haku: biggest crush on galadriel. so hot
[2024-08-29T00:02:00] haku: agreed.
[2024-08-29T00:03:37] haku: what device you need to reflash it?
[2024-08-29T00:04:21] haku: that device when you brick a vesc.
[2024-08-29T00:04:22] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-08-29T00:06:56] haku: <photos/photo_17233@29-08-2024_00-06-56.jpg>
[2024-08-29T00:07:19] haku: this a good one?
[2024-08-29T00:10:29] haku: need to learn all this just incase
[2024-08-29T00:11:22] haku: one way to brick a vesc is when dl wrong firmware yea?
[2024-08-29T00:12:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So no need for Bluetooth module?
[2024-08-29T00:31:12] Pandalgns: No
[2024-08-29T00:31:21] Pandalgns: Have a Bluetooth integrated
[2024-08-29T00:31:47] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_17234@29-08-2024_00-31-47.jpg>
[2024-08-29T00:33:25] Pandalgns: But my vesc run well, only dont run can
[2024-08-29T00:34:14] Pandalgns: But if I connect it individually everything works perfectly
[2024-08-29T00:34:14] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Pandalgns has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-08-29T00:41:22] Pandalgns: I'm going to try to restore the cable to see if it's damaged. Why can the CAN bus transmitter be damaged? I didn't suffer any blows nor did I give the cable any tug or anything.
[2024-08-29T00:43:01] Pandalgns: It was suddenly, it all started as a result of changing the accelerator from current to duty and trying the different options. The engine started making a strange noise and I started getting that error.
[2024-08-29T00:44:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Sicko thing
[2024-08-29T01:13:19] puneDir: Yes
[2024-08-29T01:18:07] Pandalgns: I will do it tomorrow because in Spain it is already 1 in the morning and it is time to get up early to work
[2024-08-29T01:18:33] Pandalgns: Anyway, when I try I'll tell you to see if it works, thank you so much mate
[2024-08-29T01:22:27] haku: more upgrades to the elon bike boys. got a bigger seat because its my bike now.
[2024-08-29T01:44:57] Paolo ⁭: Bro if he ride this bike no suspension and small solid tire I think his ⚽⚽ will stop working haha
[2024-08-29T01:48:00] haku: its smooth roads i hope lol.
[2024-08-29T02:24:17] cihan: I wonder how many amps 80-100Ah lead acid starter battery supply for spot welding. Does anyone have an idea? Battery voltage should better not drop below 10V while supplying max current.
[2024-08-29T02:25:02] Paolo ⁭: About 1000A depends by brand
[2024-08-29T02:54:29] Z P: So today my heart was broken. My highly modified SCNC 2.0 was stolen… anyone have any suggestions on badass builds?
[2024-08-29T02:57:05] Z P: Isn’t new around $15 more?
[2024-08-29T03:01:30] haku: no idea. its 20 for the pcb and 18 for shipping.
[2024-08-29T03:13:18] haku: sorry to hear that. thieves everywhere nowadays
[2024-08-29T03:18:30] Z P: Yeah so it would cost you another $39 (assuming shipping is the same) for new
[2024-08-29T03:20:12] Jason: I'd go 100v rated components for 20s
[2024-08-29T03:20:37] Jason: 20s on 85v esc?... feels like bit edging ehehe
[2024-08-29T03:21:19] Jason: put some trackers ehehehe
[2024-08-29T03:31:14] haku: anyone know what size scooter bag this is?
[2024-08-29T03:31:46] haku: need a smaller one.
[2024-08-29T03:33:44] haku: a size that can fit a 10s4p 18650 battery
[2024-08-29T03:36:29] haku: 21s is limit or thats still risky?
[2024-08-29T03:49:53] Z P: Too true
[2024-08-29T04:15:51] haku: even without regen its 20s max
[2024-08-29T05:02:26] haku: @jamaludin_algarnati this is why we fat.
[2024-08-29T05:03:34] haku: 3000 calories for 1 meal
[2024-08-29T05:23:25] Z P: Anyone have shop drawings for any Rion?
[2024-08-29T06:19:08] haku: is there a big difference in performance or components witn 84/200 and 84/250? or its just a name change?
[2024-08-29T06:20:08] haku: also same question to 80/100 and 80/150
[2024-08-29T06:26:47] Yamal: This morning it's time to walk, it's raining a little, the chamber for the Xiaomi must come in Cargo from China...

[2024-08-29T08:23:21] puneDir: Buy from offical makerbase
[2024-08-29T08:26:02] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: How do I know who is the official?
[2024-08-29T08:47:57] puneDir: https://a.aliexpress.com/_onjjCGt
[2024-08-29T08:58:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Thank you but I have more question didn't you used 72v on them ? I'm using 60v so I will not get same top speed and acceleration the question is how close will I get (if u have a photo of how do they fit in the deck. Also do u wire them in can ?)
[2024-08-29T09:03:36] puneDir: Yes i use can
[2024-08-29T09:03:48] puneDir: 60v will give some good speed too
[2024-08-29T09:06:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Why ? What is the benefit to using can ?
[2024-08-29T09:06:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also do they both fit in deck ?
[2024-08-29T09:10:19] 'lekrsu': They'll communicate with each other
[2024-08-29T09:11:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What is giving me I don't think he uses traction control 😂😂
[2024-08-29T09:12:03] 'lekrsu': Who's he
[2024-08-29T09:25:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: @punedir
[2024-08-29T09:27:02] 'lekrsu': Why wouldn't you use it

[2024-08-29T09:34:00] puneDir: Otherwise how can 2 escs take gas at the same time
[2024-08-29T09:34:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Split input
[2024-08-29T09:34:26] puneDir: And i can config both escs with one bt
[2024-08-29T09:34:40] puneDir: Whats the point of it when you have can?
[2024-08-29T09:34:54] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes but it will mirror
[2024-08-29T09:35:11] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What if I want more power for the rear
[2024-08-29T09:35:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Not front ?
[2024-08-29T09:53:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: When you test each controller, you see that they have different CAN IDs ?
[2024-08-29T09:54:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: When you change the CAN IDs, be sure your controller are physically separared on the CAN bus from each other. If you don't, the same 'new id' will be applied to both controllers and the issue remains.
[2024-08-29T09:55:01] Pandalgns: 1 have ID 96 and the other have ID 36
[2024-08-29T09:55:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: Ok, probably dead transceivers then 🥴
[2024-08-29T09:56:01] puneDir: Just set it up like that?
[2024-08-29T09:58:55] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But if I change master slave will fallow
[2024-08-29T10:00:57] Pandalgns: And if the transceivers are dead, why could it be? They break down like that, why?
[2024-08-29T10:01:19] Pandalgns: I try today to reflash firmware
[2024-08-29T10:01:47] puneDir: Wtf
[2024-08-29T10:02:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It mirrors the settings so if I want to change rear and front I need the change rear and then connect to front and change it
[2024-08-29T10:04:23] puneDir: No it doesnt

[2024-08-29T10:11:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is the max of 84100hp 100 battery?
[2024-08-29T10:12:17] puneDir: Yes
[2024-08-29T10:12:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: Voltage spikes, ground issues 😟
[2024-08-29T10:17:05] Pandalgns: 100a battery?? In the especifications say 100a phase 120a peak
[2024-08-29T10:17:17] puneDir: no it can do
[2024-08-29T10:18:27] NetworkDir: Zero motors can't handle +60A (at least cables)

[2024-08-29T11:15:16] GABE: Esc wattage ratings is about as stupid as motor wattage ratings
[2024-08-29T11:30:03] Pandalgns: Ok i dont trust the esc ratings 😂😂 i put more amps and wait to fire

[2024-08-29T20:53:42] 'lekrsu': Might need a charger to wake up again.
[2024-08-29T20:54:10] 'lekrsu': Who uses a battery without a charger? User error.

[2024-08-29T22:13:10] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Do you know what app it is?
[2024-08-29T22:16:22] 'lekrsu': Cells are often fine down to 2.5V. But don't leave it there. Charge immediately.
[2024-08-29T22:23:45] puneDir: 57v is a lot
[2024-08-29T22:23:53] puneDir: i usually charge at 70

[2024-08-29T22:44:05] GABE: the way my heart jumped when I used the multimeter.
[2024-08-29T22:46:20] 'lekrsu': As expected at absolute min voltage rating, honestly.
[2024-08-29T23:42:06] Patrick: We extend our gratitude to Jan and Roger for their preliminary work. Although they couldn't continue, CEPP is committed to honoring and carrying forward their legacy. We’re excited to announce the release of our version of the JREV Speedfork. (If Jan prefers, we are open to renaming it, since rosche left the community 😞 ) Key fixes are the brake bracket issue and a comprehensive redesign, enabling the mounting of 11-inch motors. Additionally, we are launching forks for the G2 and SNSC models, compatible with both 10-inch and 11-inch motors. Rear Suspension for G30. Here’s a sneak peek at our reworked early stage rear brake bracket for the G30 and our newly reworked version of the original JREV Speedfork.

[2024-08-30T17:07:58] Dimos: i think so
[2024-08-30T17:53:18] ElectricPowa: Really good mosfets
[2024-08-30T18:17:10] 'lekrsu': Hey @jamessoderstrom, we talked about stuttering motors. I honestly suspected halls until I measured ADC right now. This explains why it's been stupidly weird lately when I use ADC & not control.
[2024-08-30T18:17:34] 'lekrsu': throttle about 0-25% of range does this
[2024-08-30T18:17:56] 'lekrsu': spamming 50-100% throttle does this
[2024-08-30T18:22:37] 'lekrsu': The inconsistency by readings explains so much
[2024-08-30T18:26:05] Jason: brrrrr
[2024-08-30T18:26:38] 'lekrsu': indeed, half my hardware isn't working properly
[2024-08-30T18:26:47] Jason: <photos/photo_17280@30-08-2024_18-26-47.jpg>
[2024-08-30T18:26:50] 'lekrsu': Bearings, cables, brr
[2024-08-30T18:26:54] Jason: test run success with 6.05
[2024-08-30T18:27:06] Jason: fffff i need new bearings
[2024-08-30T18:38:38] haku: they might be. but its still a better ride.
[2024-08-30T18:44:58] 'lekrsu': It's time for a more long duration disassembly until everything is resolved, if it will be.
[2024-08-30T18:48:26] haku: @roschee has this yea?
[2024-08-30T20:44:08] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-08-30T20:50:36] Pandalgns: fuck fuck and fuck a thousand times
[2024-08-30T20:50:56] haku: flat?
[2024-08-30T20:51:08] Pandalgns: Motor wires broken
[2024-08-30T20:51:11] Pandalgns: 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
[2024-08-30T20:51:27] haku: oh snap. sorry to hear that bro
[2024-08-30T20:51:48] haku: how did that happen?
[2024-08-30T20:51:48] Pandalgns: And i dont know if controller are burned
[2024-08-30T20:52:30] haku: check it
[2024-08-30T20:52:55] Pandalgns: I don't know why but the motor wires wound around the shaft until the cable touched the brake disc and cut them a little.
[2024-08-30T20:53:52] haku: those motors kinda wierd. cables same side as the disk brakes
[2024-08-30T20:54:20] haku: i dont know why they decided to make it that way
[2024-08-30T20:54:20] GABE: Always being wire clippers
[2024-08-30T20:54:33] GABE: Yeah, same design flaw in FIIDO
[2024-08-30T20:54:43] GABE: Phase wires were being chewed up by the brake disc
[2024-08-30T20:55:22] Pandalgns: Time to think in buy a lonyo 80h
[2024-08-30T20:55:37] GABE: What's wrong with the motors you have now?
[2024-08-30T20:56:04] GABE: Just fix it
[2024-08-30T20:56:19] haku: 70h will fit on front unless you buy modified motor or stem. the back will easilly fit 80h if you extend it
[2024-08-30T20:57:05] haku: would it be possible to do that? 80h back and 70h or75h front? or thats bad idea?
[2024-08-30T20:57:39] Pandalgns: Try to change wires but i think in lonyo motors
[2024-08-30T20:57:43] haku: also deck can only fit 200 cells max if esc mouted outside
[2024-08-30T20:58:02] Pandalgns: 20s10p molicel 😏
[2024-08-30T20:58:47] haku: this would be great. i had this planned before but i abort the project because too fat
[2024-08-30T20:59:26] haku: 70h and 20s10p 40t or p42
[2024-08-30T20:59:31] ElectricPowa: Yes 70h IS the best. No modificacion. 75h and 80h are more biggers. A lot
[2024-08-30T20:59:44] ElectricPowa: P42
[2024-08-30T20:59:49] ElectricPowa: Or p45.
[2024-08-30T21:00:01] haku: better yet new gen cells coming
[2024-08-30T21:00:16] haku: too much power to be standing up
[2024-08-30T21:00:56] ElectricPowa: Yesss i Hope see this in this year or start of the new year
[2024-08-30T21:02:46] Andrei Albert: But who’s got moneeyyyy for them?:))
[2024-08-30T21:03:46] haku: with this woke economy i rather just buy rice. why dp we have to choose. 4 years ago i can choose both

[2024-08-30T21:34:27] Yamal: that you really like to run fast
[2024-08-30T21:35:34] Yamal: In the end everything comes out burning!!! thank goodness it rains a lot in your land
[2024-08-30T21:36:24] Yamal: also magura, how much is left on the minimoto frame? Does it come in a pedal boat from China brother?
[2024-08-30T21:36:58] Pandalgns: I don't run, I fly, always at my maximum but the problem came from here
[2024-08-30T21:37:02] haku: its suppose to arrive in the port soon. alibaba always takes forever
[2024-08-30T21:37:15] haku: unless air freight
[2024-08-30T21:37:53] Pandalgns: Wait for video
[2024-08-30T21:37:55] Rose: Hey there Mall, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2024-08-30T21:39:07] haku: its same company. the seller sells in both platforms
[2024-08-30T21:39:13] Pandalgns: <video_file>
[2024-08-30T21:39:29] haku: ali express just has the shipping advantage
[2024-08-30T21:39:31] Yamal: Since you mention Elon so much, I'm reading something about him lately... I had never paid attention to him😂
[2024-08-30T21:40:14] haku: hes a good man. dont fall for mainstream media lies.
[2024-08-30T21:41:16] Pandalgns: I'm going to continue gutting the scooter and consider changing the controllers and all the electronics since I hate the wiring this shit has
[2024-08-30T21:41:23] haku: the fork might have broke
[2024-08-30T21:41:55] Pandalgns: I hope not, but if it turns over the engine is probably broken.
[2024-08-30T21:42:35] haku: that happens if fork or axle breaks
[2024-08-30T21:42:51] Pandalgns: Fuck i wanna cry
[2024-08-30T21:42:54] Pandalgns: 😭😭
[2024-08-30T21:43:17] Yamal: adapt QS engines, and buy some aviator glasses!! but please wear a helmet and not in flip flops like the Thais...
[2024-08-30T21:43:20] haku: i hope its not. just check it when you remove it. phase cables easy fix
[2024-08-30T21:49:26] haku: its the end of the month already friend.

[2024-08-30T22:58:28] Pandalgns: I find in wallapop all front suspension with supports 50euros
[2024-08-30T22:58:44] haku: theres lots of sellers for this generic frame.
[2024-08-30T22:59:26] haku: this is why im also scared to drive this thing
[2024-08-30T23:00:17] Pandalgns: I bought the complete suspension directly since my shock absorbers had not been working very well lately, it sounded like bubbles inside and it was softer
[2024-08-30T23:00:44] haku: you can take that part off the old one
[2024-08-30T23:00:51] Pandalgns: From langfeite but its the same
[2024-08-30T23:01:00] haku: it just screws in

[2024-08-30T23:06:03] Pandalgns: I was thinking of putting awg directly and putting in new hall cables one by one
[2024-08-30T23:06:41] haku: yea you can do that. custom wires. never done one
[2024-08-30T23:07:34] haku: idk if its possible to fit thicker wires but that would be great
[2024-08-30T23:19:42] Pandalgns: 60h 22x3

[2024-08-30T23:57:19] Yamal: Let’s go to Asia Haku !!!! 💃😂
[2024-08-30T23:58:05] haku: cant afford tickets. hope you enjoy and eat the best rice these chinamen can offer
[2024-08-30T23:59:56] Yamal: Chinese/Malay/Indian/Thai rice// If I had to choose, I would go with the indian and malay cuisine
[2024-08-31T00:00:09] Pandalgns: It may fit 3 awg 12 but I will try to make the hole larger to pass the hall cables since the awg 12 fit very tightly.
[2024-08-31T00:00:36] Yamal: Cooking soul, non stop 🔥⚡️🔥⚡️🔥⚡️
[2024-08-31T00:00:41] haku: i can only afford hard mexican rice atm.

[2024-08-31T00:01:18] Yamal: Rice and Tesla..
[2024-08-31T00:37:51] haku: how do you calculate wattage again? is it volts × amps?
[2024-08-31T00:45:15] Yamal: but nominal volts or the maximum that charges your battery,,?
[2024-08-31T00:45:31] Yamal: because the bills don't work out for me,,
[2024-08-31T00:47:22] 'lekrsu': Neither if you're talking phase
[2024-08-31T00:47:48] 'lekrsu': For battery however, whatever voltage it's currently at multiplied with whatever current you're drawing.
[2024-08-31T00:49:46] Yamal: What are we talking about A for battery?
[2024-08-31T00:50:24] 'lekrsu': The current is the amps, yes
[2024-08-31T00:51:18] Yamal: Well, the value it gives is higher than the reality achieved in the vesc tool App..
[2024-08-31T00:52:08] haku: is vesctool pretty acurate?
[2024-08-31T00:52:54] 'lekrsu': vesc tool on rt display shows phase not batt
[2024-08-31T00:53:27] 'lekrsu': nothing wrong there
[2024-08-31T00:53:30] Yamal: But we talking about watt peak
[2024-08-31T00:53:43] Yamal: Just the Formula..

[2024-08-31T12:33:42] iMarek: hello group. my ubox burned down but it's not that bad. Does anyone have experience with repairs. Is it possible to replace this part? I'll be happy for your answers
[2024-08-31T12:46:55] puneDir: Why daly
[2024-08-31T12:57:50] Pandalgns: Jk, ant... better
[2024-08-31T13:07:58] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: jk is different only because of its active balancing but if you set ANT to 0.001 what is the difference?
[2024-08-31T13:14:36] 'lekrsu': Ant does passive to resistor. Active means reusing the energy.
[2024-08-31T13:21:01] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: At the end of the day, for me, it is the same result to leave the series balanced and I have used jk and ANT Daly, for my taste it is the worst.
[2024-08-31T13:51:25] 'lekrsu': Both are a no-maintenance solution if cells are in good condition
[2024-08-31T14:04:17] Paolo ⁭: Every of us agree, Daly is worst BMS in the industry
[2024-08-31T14:16:50] Yamal: https://youtu.be/iqdZ6fSKljw?si=GP_XI_hIkMjQx3Dt
[2024-08-31T15:17:49] haku: jeez. these guys are nuts. i wonder wich fardriver that dude using to power that motor
[2024-08-31T15:32:22] Yamal: I have no idea but the QS motors are also impressive, man, what a shame there isn't an 11" to make it more portable and stuff.
[2024-08-31T15:33:43] Yamal: I think that, as in everything, it is talking to the Chinese, and telling him to make an 11"
[2024-08-31T15:41:13] haku: these are mopeds motors. the big qs or sotion. im not sure. but dam these southern boys know how to tune. that was insane
[2024-08-31T15:41:14] GABE: I never bought it because it was too expensive
[2024-08-31T15:48:58] haku: these are large stators. not tiny scooter ones

[2024-08-31T23:56:46] haku: not india unfortunately
[2024-08-31T23:59:27] Yamal: I think US?
[2024-09-01T00:03:34] Yamal: waiting to see if FOCforever tells us things about Seven...
[2024-09-01T00:04:17] haku: he talked about it in his youtube once
[2024-09-01T00:05:13] haku: that dude shits on KO moto everytime lol
[2024-09-01T00:09:09] haku: honestly i think elon would respect the opensource of vesc. he will just make his version under vedders approval.
[2024-09-01T00:10:04] Yamal: WhAt Chanel
[2024-09-01T00:11:27] haku: https://youtu.be/DlKkYlcHbWA?si=mBRa3tgy8spCRq6Z
[2024-09-01T00:11:39] haku: you prolly seen this
[2024-09-01T00:17:25] Yamal: Yes
[2024-09-01T00:18:05] Yamal: I didn't know it was the same guy
[2024-09-01T00:18:11] Pandalgns: 700usd
[2024-09-01T00:18:12] Pandalgns: Lol
[2024-09-01T00:18:18] haku: i believe so
[2024-09-01T00:18:49] Pandalgns: and that is the "worst"
[2024-09-01T00:18:56] Pandalgns: The Best 1500usd
[2024-09-01T00:18:58] Pandalgns: Watafak
[2024-09-01T00:18:59] haku: there will be a market for these. only vesc that can power bigger emoto motors
[2024-09-01T00:19:45] haku: aside from older shull. bit thats really not much used here in the US
[2024-09-01T00:20:16] Pandalgns: I expected more from vesc... sometimes I feel like it doesn't give me as much as I thought it would.
[2024-09-01T00:21:18] haku: 150v components
[2024-09-01T00:21:57] Pandalgns: @jamaludin_algarnati 🤷‍♂
[2024-09-01T00:22:03] haku: vesc is good for smaller pevs. it made for it
[2024-09-01T00:22:10] Yamal: You have to feel the power of vesc drivers with high discharge, with high discharge batteries, then your roads will become narrow paths...
[2024-09-01T00:22:42] Yamal: strong accelerations and speeds of more than 130 km/h
[2024-09-01T00:23:13] Pandalgns: Wich vesc i need?? 300euro for a vesc?? I need 2 vesc
[2024-09-01T00:24:26] Pandalgns: If i need to spend 600 700 800 euros in 2 controllers... i think about kelly or something else
[2024-09-01T00:26:06] Pandalgns: Now, i dont have good results but dont have bad results with my 84100hp.... is a bad controllers... yes... but 90 euros each controller.... good controllers how much?? 400 500 euros eaxh controller?? Im a normal guy with a normal work 😂😂 i cant afford a lot of money in controllers
[2024-09-01T00:27:02] haku: ive never used vesc in a high powered build before so i cannot say much. my spintend was perfect for 60v tgough
[2024-09-01T00:32:41] Pandalgns: For example, with my 84100 I don't know if I have them poorly configured or that the battery doesn't have enough for both but I expected more from them... for the 180 euros I spent on both I thought I would have a little more top speed and a little more torque but I think that with a jp or something similar it would have equaled the result right now, maybe with a good configuration and expanding the battery it will be better but at the moment they don't go very far either
[2024-09-01T00:34:25] haku: i did not tune mine properly too. it became slower actually but im okay with that aslong as the acceleration is smooth and has ebrake
[2024-09-01T00:35:04] haku: i went from stock 55mph gps to 47mph gps
[2024-09-01T00:35:16] haku: but very smooth ride
[2024-09-01T00:35:58] Pandalgns: Im 56kmh top speed with 2 janobike t10 motors 1000w
[2024-09-01T00:36:10] Pandalgns: At 14s
[2024-09-01T00:36:33] Pandalgns: But i think this is slower than stock janobike
[2024-09-01T00:37:05] haku: i did not want to push the battery because i did not make it.
[2024-09-01T00:37:42] Pandalgns: Acceleration is not bad but... i dont know... my expectations were higher
[2024-09-01T00:38:54] Yamal: How many phase amps do you carry in your configuration per motor?
[2024-09-01T00:39:06] Pandalgns: 120a phase
[2024-09-01T00:39:34] Yamal: So 240 total?
[2024-09-01T00:39:52] Pandalgns: Yep probably the battery cant carry with all dischargue
[2024-09-01T00:42:30] Yamal: Just one of your controllers, it has more phase than the whole of a DT Thunder 2, can you imagine? We are used to talking about many phase A's, but we must not forget where we come from! jp?Savoton? please
[2024-09-01T00:43:45] Pandalgns: For this reason, if I have more amps than a dt thunder 2 I expected more than what it is giving me
[2024-09-01T00:45:20] Yamal: We are talking about the future, about compact and small with a lot of power, we are talking about energy efficiency, we are talking about pure waves that take care of your engines "" in short we are talking about BV, this is its reflection and its legacy😂
[2024-09-01T00:47:02] Yamal: and don't worry about losing a license plate, look at my last one,,,
[2024-09-01T00:47:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What battery what motors ?
[2024-09-01T00:47:31] Pandalgns: 14s 4p Samsung 50e 2 52v 1000w janobike t10
[2024-09-01T00:47:36] Yamal: <photos/photo_17313@01-09-2024_00-47-36.jpg>
[2024-09-01T00:47:48] Pandalgns: But i want to spand my battery to 8p
[2024-09-01T00:48:08] Yamal: willy FOG couldn't resist it
[2024-09-01T00:48:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So I'll get a better top speed I have 16s 1p but somehow 28ah
[2024-09-01T00:48:37] haku: if i had extra money a esc or vesc that can do 30s would be great.
[2024-09-01T00:49:06] haku: but ill just go with 20s cause spintend is all i have atm
[2024-09-01T00:49:07] Pandalgns: Only 56kmh top speed
[2024-09-01T00:49:24] Pandalgns: I expected about 65-70kmh
[2024-09-01T00:49:38] Pandalgns: And a bit more acceleration
[2024-09-01T00:49:59] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: My bro on a zero10x 13s 18ah weakahh battery does 62 with no filed yet (on 75100)
[2024-09-01T00:50:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: His front wheel pops on acceleration can do a power whilee easy
[2024-09-01T00:51:37] Yamal: And stock halo?
[2024-09-01T00:51:45] Pandalgns: So I understand that either I don't have them configured correctly or there is something wrong here... I think I should have more top speed and more acceleration.
[2024-09-01T00:51:53] Pandalgns: With my stock halo??
[2024-09-01T00:51:59] Yamal: Top speed
[2024-09-01T00:52:00] Pandalgns: 90kmh top speed
[2024-09-01T00:52:11] Pandalgns: A bit more
[2024-09-01T00:52:15] Pandalgns: Probably 93
[2024-09-01T00:52:31] Yamal: Maybe something happens in the configuration...! it's not normal
[2024-09-01T00:53:10] Pandalgns: Do you think the Xiaomi should run more?
[2024-09-01T00:53:15] Pandalgns: I think
[2024-09-01T00:53:37] Yamal: I went over 70 km/h with an engine
[2024-09-01T00:53:53] Yamal: But sad..
[2024-09-01T00:54:16] Pandalgns: I cant over 56 with 2 1000w motors.... i cry
[2024-09-01T00:54:18] Yamal: Let’s see the route
[2024-09-01T00:54:54] Yamal: <photos/photo_17314@01-09-2024_00-54-54.jpg>
[2024-09-01T00:55:46] Pandalgns: What motor?
[2024-09-01T00:55:51] Yamal: The speed is not correct, the wheel must have skidded at some point, my speed is around 70/75 km/h
[2024-09-01T00:56:08] Yamal: 60h 22/3
[2024-09-01T00:56:28] Pandalgns: Volts and amps?
[2024-09-01T00:56:53] Yamal: 20s battery
[2024-09-01T00:57:01] Yamal: 100 A battery
[2024-09-01T00:57:10] Yamal: Phase 130 I think..
[2024-09-01T00:57:36] Pandalgns: 3000 nominal watts??
[2024-09-01T00:57:54] Yamal: Don’t know the nominal..
[2024-09-01T00:58:02] Yamal: Also the peak…
[2024-09-01T00:58:23] Pandalgns: Soy bro but i think its slow for a 20s 60h 22x3
[2024-09-01T00:59:40] Yamal: I hope to ride 12fet vesc soon to see how long it holds up but they will surely go out on fire on some highways,,
[2024-09-01T01:00:00] Yamal: and believe me it will happen
[2024-09-01T01:00:04] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-09-01T01:01:05] haku: dream bigger. 30fet
[2024-09-01T01:01:37] Jason: mmm
[2024-09-01T01:01:40] Yamal: For me now 12 it’s okay
[2024-09-01T01:02:12] Yamal: Future proyect everything can happen?
[2024-09-01T01:02:31] Yamal: But 30 seven
[2024-09-01T01:02:52] Yamal: Have Infineon tolt too
[2024-09-01T01:03:10] haku: trust in elon. electronics always gets better
[2024-09-01T01:04:53] Jason: mmm
[2024-09-01T01:04:54] Jason: TOLT
[2024-09-01T01:05:02] Yamal: As soon as I get back from vacation, I'm calling Sweden so the Viking King can send them to me on a charter flight.
[2024-09-01T01:05:06] haku: if you smart like vesc lords you can prolly design your own board.
[2024-09-01T01:05:35] Jason: I have to get my lazy ass up to make a vesc
[2024-09-01T01:05:55] Jason: planning for one that fits inside g30 controller case
[2024-09-01T01:06:02] Jason: to-247
[2024-09-01T01:06:05] Pandalgns: Halo is dead😭😭
[2024-09-01T01:06:06] Jason: or..TOLL
[2024-09-01T01:06:32] Pandalgns: But i can res that shit
[2024-09-01T01:06:34] Pandalgns: 😏😏
[2024-09-01T01:06:42] Jason: <photos/photo_17316@01-09-2024_01-06-42.jpg>
[2024-09-01T01:06:43] Pandalgns: And more stronger
[2024-09-01T01:06:49] Jason: I want vesc
[2024-09-01T01:07:00] Yamal: TOLT
[2024-09-01T01:07:01] haku: thats more of my style
[2024-09-01T01:07:11] Jason: yra but it's more expensive
[2024-09-01T01:07:26] Jason: also harder to get imo
[2024-09-01T01:08:08] Jason: went out to ride for 100km round trip, could've gone much further Caz I had 30% batt left rofl
[2024-09-01T01:09:07] Yamal: 😁
[2024-09-01T01:09:49] Jason: tolt so expensive
[2024-09-01T01:09:50] Jason: aaaaa
[2024-09-01T01:10:03] Yamal: Spintend?
[2024-09-01T01:10:09] Jason: that was
[2024-09-01T01:10:11] Jason: not tolt
[2024-09-01T01:10:17] haku: is tolt really that big of an improvement?
[2024-09-01T01:10:21] Pandalgns: With liquid cooling 😂😂
[2024-09-01T01:10:54] ElectricPowa: Tronic.....
[2024-09-01T01:11:00] Jason: you don't have to remove heat from the board you can just remove directly from the chip
[2024-09-01T01:11:09] Yamal: Yes..
[2024-09-01T01:11:30] Jason: arcing?
[2024-09-01T01:11:32] Yamal: Same ,, Willy FOCer
[2024-09-01T01:11:54] Jason: lol
[2024-09-01T01:13:17] haku: the chips cool itself with heatsink or what?
[2024-09-01T01:14:11] Jason: with TOLL heat traves through chip >solder > pcbs > heatsink with TOLT heat travels through chip > heatsink
[2024-09-01T01:14:23] Jason: much more heat transfer capable
[2024-09-01T01:14:45] haku: i see. makes sense now
[2024-09-01T01:16:31] Yamal: Why 18 seven don’t have same fet,,?
[2024-09-01T01:16:33] haku: talaria now 72v dang. https://youtu.be/1CBYZ1pbDt4?si=kdVsAu6ZlSIqp_-8
[2024-09-01T01:17:22] Yamal: <photos/photo_17318@01-09-2024_01-17-22.jpg>
[2024-09-01T01:27:23] Yamal: my cousin, Jason! 😁
[2024-09-01T01:27:53] haku: french?
[2024-09-01T01:28:21] Yamal: she doesn't look french
[2024-09-01T01:29:23] haku: i think this is one of the sports that women might have an advantage over men because of weight
[2024-09-01T01:30:04] haku: men have denser bones and bigger brains makes them heavier.
[2024-09-01T01:30:14] Yamal: Well yes... realize the ESC races, there were a lot of women...
[2024-09-01T01:31:30] haku: very true. but in france you never know. hormone blockers are a huge thing there i think
[2024-09-01T01:31:35] Yamal: Is it sad that the Williams F1 is so stopped? .. :(
[2024-09-01T01:32:41] haku: i stopped following scooter racing unfortunately
[2024-09-01T01:32:54] Yamal: In America, growth hormone is taken more for competitors, right?
[2024-09-01T01:33:00] haku: blue man is all that comes to mind
[2024-09-01T01:33:56] haku: pro athletes im sure but its in the banned list. they know a way around it though but sticter testing here
[2024-09-01T01:34:54] Yamal: Have you ever heard of Marcus Rühl the German beast?
[2024-09-01T01:35:04] haku: no
[2024-09-01T01:35:44] haku: i dont follow alot of sports now.
[2024-09-01T01:36:45] Yamal: 🤙
[2024-09-01T01:37:40] Yamal: Old school
[2024-09-01T01:38:55] haku: that juiced to the gills
[2024-09-01T01:41:40] haku: trying to finish the jr elon bike. figuring out a way to mount it perfectly.
[2024-09-01T01:41:49] haku: <photos/photo_17321@01-09-2024_01-41-49.jpg>
[2024-09-01T01:42:22] haku: idk why spintend went with this design
[2024-09-01T01:43:30] Yamal: no one more beast than this man
[2024-09-01T01:43:52] haku: that pure viking energy right there
[2024-09-01T01:44:38] haku: look at the size of his neck. superior genes.
[2024-09-01T01:45:38] Yamal: He seems to like silver chains.
[2024-09-01T01:47:05] haku: thats to show dominance
[2024-09-01T01:47:17] Yamal: Why do you say so, because of the anchoring system, maybe better in the 85/250?
[2024-09-01T01:47:41] haku: yes 85/250 has proper mounting holes
[2024-09-01T01:48:04] Yamal: Yes…
[2024-09-01T01:48:34] Yamal: Next gol 🤲
[2024-09-01T01:49:45] Yamal: The truth is that the anchors on the edge of the box are more comfortable and not just below...
[2024-09-01T01:53:10] Yamal: Nami “martini “
[2024-09-01T01:55:28] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-09-01T01:55:28] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-01T02:09:35] ElectricPowa: Are good this mosfets ??
[2024-09-01T02:39:39] Yamal: Very gud!?
[2024-09-01T02:44:45] haku: i can only aligned 2 screws in 😭 i messed up the other 2. oh well.
[2024-09-01T02:44:59] haku: witg thermal paste it woulndt matter i hope
[2024-09-01T02:50:36] Yamal: Tomorrow speed test ,,?
[2024-09-01T02:56:01] haku: maybe if i mount and everything properly
[2024-09-01T03:03:29] Yamal: https://youtu.be/YlYmiUuvUgY?si=rtOflMqaQKqh5LjQ
[2024-09-01T03:05:01] ElectricPowa: ?
[2024-09-01T03:15:46] haku: i think that will hold for now till i find a proper mount.
[2024-09-01T03:17:55] Yamal: I don't know, to be honest, but I suppose they will be quite good seeing that this electronics is very new...now when it comes to choosing, I chose the large 32...
[2024-09-01T03:18:34] Yamal: The seat is funny
[2024-09-01T03:19:25] haku: i have a smaller one but for the sake of testing im using bigger one
[2024-09-01T03:19:29] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-09-01T03:20:28] haku: i still have to adjust v brakes.
[2024-09-01T03:21:22] haku: and put thicker cables on the bat
[2024-09-01T03:46:52] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-09-01T03:52:06] ElectricPowa: Ok thanks 😁 the One i have bought have TOLT mosfet similar tecnólogy but less mosfets.....😅
[2024-09-01T03:52:48] haku: <photos/photo_17326@01-09-2024_03-52-48.jpg>
[2024-09-01T03:53:04] ElectricPowa: I want do One i Need study
[2024-09-01T03:53:11] haku: scooter still flat
[2024-09-01T04:08:56] haku: <video_file>
[2024-09-01T07:19:36] haku: jr elonbike is ready for testing boys.
[2024-09-01T07:25:34] Jhonny Nuñez: <photos/photo_17328@01-09-2024_07-25-34.jpg>
[2024-09-01T07:25:35] Jhonny Nuñez: <photos/photo_17329@01-09-2024_07-25-35.jpg>
[2024-09-01T07:26:27] haku: dang. thats ubox yea?
[2024-09-01T07:27:07] Jhonny Nuñez: Yes
[2024-09-01T07:27:53] Jhonny Nuñez: They covered the warranty, I don't know why the fault occurred, the capacitors burst.
[2024-09-01T07:27:56] haku: what were battery amps and voltage?
[2024-09-01T07:28:12] Jhonny Nuñez: 72v 47ah
[2024-09-01T07:28:52] haku: amps
[2024-09-01T07:28:57] Jhonny Nuñez: bms 150a download
[2024-09-01T07:29:14] haku: so 75a per vesc?
[2024-09-01T07:29:58] haku: is this single motor?
[2024-09-01T07:31:10] Jhonny Nuñez: I was going 40km/h when suddenly there was an explosion and I thought it was a rock, since I was going so slow, the scooter kept running, so I went to cross the street and hit the accelerator, the controller flashed red, indicating a voltage failure, I got home and turned off the controller
[2024-09-01T07:31:15] Jhonny Nuñez: Dual
[2024-09-01T07:34:03] Jhonny Nuñez: They sent me the new controllers, which presented firmware errors, I deprogrammed the controller, I found their service, they updated it to version 6.05 and they sent me the Windows - Mac and Android Vesc of the Vesc version 6.05
[2024-09-01T07:37:55] haku: thats good to know they honor thier warranty. they never honored my spinny throttle.
[2024-09-01T07:38:20] haku: how long have you had that spintend?
[2024-09-01T07:40:03] haku: this is from amy spintend or james?
[2024-09-01T07:45:02] Jhonny Nuñez: Spinterd
[2024-09-01T07:46:17] Jhonny Nuñez: The first ones lasted me 1 month, now I've had the new ones for 2 weeks, since they were installed.
[2024-09-01T07:53:16] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Good morning friends, do you know anything about @SibClimb? I can't get in touch with him. I've been waiting for a reply to a message for over a week, but if he does, he'll be the busiest person in the world. On August 25th, I sent him a message waiting for a reply. This is a joke.
[2024-09-01T07:54:52] haku: did you get your shul from him?
[2024-09-01T07:55:28] haku: he must be busy racing season. he drops in here once a while
[2024-09-01T07:58:33] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: In general, yes, he talks but he doesn't answer. It happens to more people, not just me. If he's in a rush, he can hire a secretary and serve customers 🤷‍♀️ so as not to leave people without knowing anything.
[2024-09-01T08:10:29] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It's a little frustrating

[2024-09-01T09:17:07] Yamal: Something must have happened there, there are more and more people who use them, very recently a boy with a GT2 was very happy, with 190A phase
[2024-09-01T09:20:55] Yamal: Anyway, how are those Chilean Namis doing?

[2024-09-01T10:40:28] Patrick: You have ERPM in Vesc, you can see it on the second RT data screen, logs or realtime data tab.
[2024-09-01T10:40:46] Patrick: You can just calculate the RPM
[2024-09-01T11:33:17] Rose: Hey there €upio, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2024-09-01T15:23:11] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Hi, open up if you can help me. Is there a way to know the winding of the motors? I bought some 33x2 motors but we think they sent 22x3. Is there a way to know? By rpm, by kg or with the Vesc app. Does anyone know a way?
[2024-09-01T15:24:55] Tobias Althaus: Hello everyone, I have the ubox85150 with ADC Board V3. Is it possible to use the switch from the throttle for the lights and the on/off switch for the ubox? Both are push buttons.

[2024-09-01T15:42:41] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Hello, I bought this welder https://www.keenlab.de/index.php/product/kweld-complete-kit/ but I realized that it does not connect to the normal current of a house. Could you tell me what type of battery I need to power the welder and be able to weld a 0.1 copper sheet?
[2024-09-01T15:45:59] 'lekrsu': They showed quite a few battery examples further down on the link
[2024-09-01T15:50:59] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, I have seen them but I was not sure if with such a small 3s battery I could do it.

[2024-09-01T15:55:28] ElectricPowa: You have a minimotors controller ? 🤣❤️
[2024-09-01T15:55:45] ElectricPowa: Is a good way for check
[2024-09-01T16:03:17] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: ☺️
[2024-09-01T16:04:13] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: minimotors was good in the 70🤣
[2024-09-01T17:21:25] Paolo ⁭: What vrand
[2024-09-01T17:35:30] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I bought some 33x2 engines but the scooter doesn't reach more than 126. We don't know if the engines are really 33x2 or 22x3 and we don't know how to check it.
[2024-09-01T17:37:13] Paolo ⁭: You have to open it
[2024-09-01T17:38:07] Paolo ⁭: But anyway if is 75h with 22x3 you won't reach even 120 without field weakening.
[2024-09-01T17:38:17] Paolo ⁭: So I think is 33x2
[2024-09-01T17:38:29] Paolo ⁭: Another way is buying yr1035+ and measure phases
[2024-09-01T17:46:17] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: When I bought it I ordered 33x2 70h
[2024-09-01T17:46:56] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: but I'm having a hard time reaching 130
[2024-09-01T17:47:36] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I have 22s 3schul v4 and the motors but the battery is not high discharge
[2024-09-01T18:08:17] Paolo ⁭: Can you share you configuration?
[2024-09-01T18:08:55] Paolo ⁭: Battery current motor current , and maybe field weakenjng
[2024-09-01T18:09:37] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I'm going to look and see now, I tell him
[2024-09-01T18:20:53] Tobias Althaus: It’s just a momentary switch, so it would only send a pulse. There is continuity only when I hold it down.
[2024-09-01T18:27:51] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Rear motor 200 phase 400 Front motor 180 phase 400 fw 70 in both engines
[2024-09-01T18:28:40] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I don't know where to look at this
[2024-09-01T18:29:39] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <files/Fron.csv>
[2024-09-01T18:29:53] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <files/Rear.csv>
[2024-09-01T18:33:15] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2024-09-01T18:33:20] Paolo ⁭: Do you have this?
[2024-09-01T18:40:29] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes
[2024-09-01T18:45:28] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <video_file>
[2024-09-01T18:48:56] Tobias Althaus: Oh, sorry 🤦🏼‍♂️ 5 volts is for the throttle. So, the throttle connection has 5 volts, 0 volts, and Ground. Then there are the two buttons: 1x for on/off, 1x for the light. They share the ground from the throttle and have a separate key wire. The throttle works since I’ve already done a test ride.
[2024-09-01T18:51:37] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: the second is the front engine
[2024-09-01T18:53:41] Paolo ⁭: Measure motors between two phase , and tell me how much resistance you see
[2024-09-01T18:54:09] Paolo ⁭: Vesc measured is not accurate, that's why I asked for this
[2024-09-01T18:59:35] Paolo ⁭: Yes because yr is 4 wire
[2024-09-01T19:00:24] Paolo ⁭: I think yes, but not sure
[2024-09-01T19:00:47] Paolo ⁭: I see someone with vsett motor 20mOhm, which is not true obviously
[2024-09-01T19:00:50] haku: how can you guys even tell the windings by the resistance?
[2024-09-01T19:01:14] Paolo ⁭: DC also is good , but you have to do manually
[2024-09-01T19:01:39] Paolo ⁭: Two wire for power supply and two wire in mV and measure voltage difference
[2024-09-01T19:02:40] Paolo ⁭: You can power with 10v and 1A anyway :)
[2024-09-01T19:04:30] Tobias Althaus: Yellow and Ground is On/off. Blue and Ground is The light.
[2024-09-01T19:05:34] haku: get lipos or truck battery
[2024-09-01T19:06:48] haku: also kweld facebook good place to learn
[2024-09-01T19:08:33] Tobias Althaus: Okay, then it unfortunately won’t work Last question 🫣 I have three wires for the e-brake on each of the two brake levers. However, the ADC board only has one connection for this. Can I just connect the wires in parallel so that both levers are connected to the analog brake detection input?
[2024-09-01T19:11:07] Tobias Althaus: Thank You 🙂
[2024-09-01T19:20:21] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I already ordered the battery from the link
[2024-09-01T19:23:26] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Then when I get home I measure it and I'll tell him I'll make a video
[2024-09-01T20:13:39] ElectricPowa: Yeah I know. Only for connect and know if is 22/3 or 33/2

[2024-09-01T21:41:09] Yamal: Is it okay for 250A or can I make pesto pasta with my motor cables?
[2024-09-01T21:43:05] Yamal: Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiresssssssssss
[2024-09-01T21:44:17] haku: idk what 4mm2 in awg but that might be too thin. not too sure
[2024-09-01T21:44:55] haku: that maybe 12awg or 10awg
[2024-09-01T21:46:38] Yamal: Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiresssssssssss
[2024-09-01T21:47:14] haku: just do it see what happens lol
[2024-09-01T21:47:34] haku: do it by feel. if it gets hot or not
[2024-09-01T21:47:54] Yamal: Hot really!!!
[2024-09-01T21:48:07] Yamal: Spaghetti don’t know ,,,
[2024-09-01T21:50:38] Yamal: but everything is wrong with my proyect, since if I mount powerful esc my motors, or phase motor rather, will not be ready, what does this mean? low configuration in programming,, and therefore not taking advantage of the power of it,,, good things? Well, heart attack temperatures when carrying esc that give 400A phase and 200 battery in. 200A phase 100 A battery right?
[2024-09-01T22:01:00] haku: i have no idea to tune vesc. you might want to ask vesc lords
[2024-09-01T22:01:18] haku: i just run basic motor config

[2024-09-01T22:12:55] haku: lol
[2024-09-01T22:14:17] haku: the strongest men in the world have viking dna and they have bellys.
[2024-09-01T22:19:08] haku: sad to see the men who built western civilization came to that. wokemind is the real enemy.
[2024-09-01T22:19:57] haku: there is still resistance. there will be a cure to that virus
[2024-09-01T22:21:33] haku: rainbow day shirt in schools are the problem. i had my boy wear red white and blue sleeveless shirt
[2024-09-01T22:39:29] haku: as a man who has mongol ancestry we mongoloids feel bad. we dont like wokeness
[2024-09-01T22:41:58] Yamal: you also hunt wolves with golden eagles
[2024-09-01T22:44:10] haku: we also killed 10% of the world population. this is why i dont want my people the chinamen to win.
[2024-09-01T22:44:12] Yamal: <photos/photo_17336@01-09-2024_22-44-12.jpg>
[2024-09-01T22:45:19] haku: we will have bald eagles going after the wokemind this time.
[2024-09-01T22:45:34] haku: while riding ebikes emotos
[2024-09-01T22:45:46] Yamal: I had eagles and falcons for some years, an exciting world...
[2024-09-01T22:47:25] haku: its cool to see the tamed falcons. kill on command
[2024-09-01T22:48:27] haku: i mean kill pest birds and rodents. not people
[2024-09-01T22:49:12] Yamal: especially in flight due to arrogance
[2024-09-01T22:49:17] Yamal: Translate just bad
[2024-09-01T22:50:05] haku: ive seen one have a tamed falcon relased to attack from a moving car. insane stuff
[2024-09-01T22:50:45] Yamal: There are two types of hunting with falcons: what is called hand-for-hand would be one, in which the falcon leaves your hand directly in pursuit behind the prey.
[2024-09-01T22:51:02] haku: https://youtube.com/shorts/1GAkiDDBsi8?si=o9Dt7f263IZyyZLh
[2024-09-01T22:51:51] haku: oldschool attack drones
[2024-09-01T22:52:40] Yamal: and the second and most prominent of the falcons is due to "haughtiness", the falcon makes its roof above you at what I know 100/200 meters, and when you lift a prey the falcon makes a swooping flight where it generally slashes down up,,
[2024-09-01T22:53:05] Yamal: Yankee kestrel
[2024-09-01T22:54:26] Yamal: I never had one, but it is fun to hunt small birds with them.
[2024-09-01T22:54:40] haku: i wonder how you train these birds. prolly when they are still hatchlings you raise them
[2024-09-01T22:55:19] Yamal: falconry is an art and a world, it requires a lot of time and money
[2024-09-01T22:56:08] haku: prolly have falcon breeders too. they prolly cost alot
[2024-09-01T22:56:35] haku: that be cool to have one though. just for protection against the woke.
[2024-09-01T22:57:55] haku: woke try to attack you with thier rainbows. you release your falcon.
[2024-09-01T22:58:41] haku: blue man comes to your house. swooosh falcon take out his nuts
[2024-09-01T22:58:52] Yamal: For that, a pitbull or a doberman is better.
[2024-09-01T22:59:57] Yamal: Falcons are very sensitive and nervous birds and we must try to raise them in such a way or rather give them a life as close as possible to their life in freedom.
[2024-09-01T23:00:32] haku: agreed my dog is woke i think. hes not a command dog but more of a feminish boy.
[2024-09-01T23:01:21] Yamal: paint a mustache

[2024-09-02T16:04:24] Yamal: I don’t understand ^^'
[2024-09-02T17:21:55] Jhonny Nuñez: Well well, I got 2 new ones, due to the failure that the previous controller presented, last week the controllers suffered a programming failure, every time you changed the controller to program them they were deprogrammed, so the same people from them updated them to version 6.05, and also the vesc tool app to 6.05 to program them, the app has new options, then Jesus helped me program the controllers and they were left with the new version, pulling out much better and the scooter feels smoother.
[2024-09-02T17:32:38] sombre_enfant: U wouldve won if u didnt had penalty, crash, and broke scoot
[2024-09-02T19:00:24] haku: why was that one guy so upset?
[2024-09-02T19:06:10] haku: i really dont understand because no english captions. it might be just how the french speak.
[2024-09-02T20:10:16] Finn: Lets go for a test run
[2024-09-02T20:10:55] haku: thats cool dude. you built that?
[2024-09-02T20:16:37] Finn: Yeah
[2024-09-02T20:16:42] Finn: <photos/photo_17348@02-09-2024_20-16-42.jpg>
[2024-09-02T20:17:54] haku: can u use high discharge liion cells on those instead of lipo or too heavy?
[2024-09-02T20:29:20] Lieven L.: Yeah no problem, these things have power for days.
[2024-09-02T20:30:58] Lieven L.: But if you fly 6S the pack is going to be quiet big. Pouch cells are way more compact.
[2024-09-02T21:13:40] Finn: I use lipo for that purpose
[2024-09-02T21:13:43] Finn: 120C 5s 1500mAh

[2024-09-02T21:18:34] haku: its impossible to fly these without goggles? or can you do dji mavic style app on phone?
[2024-09-02T21:19:52] Finn: Sure you can fly them without just difficult😂
[2024-09-02T21:19:59] Finn: My goggles still on the way
[2024-09-02T21:21:48] haku: i always see dudes in the park flying these and doing stunts. pretty cool
[2024-09-02T21:22:28] haku: its loud buzz too
[2024-09-02T21:23:28] haku: fpv style videography. is cool too
[2024-09-02T21:25:54] Yamal: with the scooter in single no,,, Besides, I had to buy some plane tickets that left me dry, but don't worry, I'll go visit you in France or we'll meet somewhere!

[2024-09-02T22:50:46] Yamal: Shamans also have email,,?
[2024-09-02T22:51:26] haku: mine does.
[2024-09-02T22:52:04] Yamal: Good! Is like modern Shaman
[2024-09-02T22:52:49] Yamal: but he Does the famous treatments with jungle vines??
[2024-09-02T22:54:01] Yamal: talk to him about vesc XD
[2024-09-02T22:54:43] haku: he said fast big standing scooter not a good idea but vesc is great
[2024-09-02T22:57:39] Yamal: Small and fast if that's a good idea?
[2024-09-02T22:58:11] haku: yea. portability he said is good idea
[2024-09-02T22:58:38] haku: just dont build it too fast
[2024-09-02T23:00:25] haku: in my vision it was so clear like post nut clarity. ive seen myself crash and my son adopted by the woke because he lost his dad

[2024-09-02T23:09:07] Pandalgns: I live in a gypsy neighborhood 😂😂
[2024-09-02T23:09:15] haku: i made mine because of necessity.

[2024-09-02T23:09:49] Pandalgns: I can find all of i need 😂😂 for free

[2024-09-02T23:28:20] haku: zooz pretty pricey for me for what your getting tbh.
[2024-09-02T23:30:51] Yamal: this man set up the bac controllers
[2024-09-02T23:32:46] haku: rich kids setup
[2024-09-02T23:33:54] haku: there some kids in our park with those bikes and super 73 aside from surrons. i want my son to feel the poverty in this economy
[2024-09-02T23:35:53] Yamal: <photos/photo_17355@02-09-2024_23-35-53.jpg>
[2024-09-02T23:37:26] haku: asi prolly one of the best but super expensive.
[2024-09-02T23:37:36] haku: you can get more for less
[2024-09-03T00:07:54] purp: I got a v2 nami frame if anyone wants to cop it for a custom build.
[2024-09-03T00:11:48] Yamal: Sale or start new projects, I don’t understand
[2024-09-03T00:13:15] purp: sale if anyone wanted it. i have 3 total but i’m using the other two for my projects. got one extra laying around
[2024-09-03T00:13:29] Yamal: Shull 1000 on KTM I loved that project with incredible power and temperatures of no more than 32°C, incredible
[2024-09-03T00:13:38] haku: whats a v2 and how many versions are there?
[2024-09-03T00:14:27] Yamal: 3 version
[2024-09-03T00:14:41] Yamal: Last one okeeeeee
[2024-09-03T00:14:54] haku: what are the major differences if you dont mind me asking?
[2024-09-03T00:15:16] purp: there’s actually a ton of versions. first version 1 had what i called the pringle frame which is the first version and then they reinforced some points and added the new metal battery box and then the newest version has even more reinforcements but basically the same frame
[2024-09-03T00:15:26] Yamal: https://youtu.be/7pjP3ZPumTI?si=5zDYEqR1RzGJ6zrJ
[2024-09-03T00:15:33] purp: i have over 20k miles on my version 1 frame so any of the newer ones are solid
[2024-09-03T00:15:38] Yamal: Frame , last version..
[2024-09-03T00:16:38] haku: burnie2 and burn e 2max same size frame?
[2024-09-03T00:17:28] Yamal: Yes
[2024-09-03T00:18:04] Yamal: I call the latest version "Tesla reinforcement"
[2024-09-03T00:18:41] Yamal: due to the type of reinforcement they gave him in the neck
[2024-09-03T00:19:30] Yamal: also have some plates on the front sides due to some chassis that broke,,
[2024-09-03T00:21:39] purp: yeah i trash my v1 frame hitting speed bumps at 65mph with forks on them and it handles it well. i’m going to change the rake angle to support the forks better on my v2 version of the dual stem nami
[2024-09-03T00:22:50] Yamal: Where are you from,,?
[2024-09-03T00:23:58] haku: what is nami frame made of? stainless steel?
[2024-09-03T00:26:36] Yamal: aluminum and magnesium alloy
[2024-09-03T00:27:14] Yamal: Is just Shaotao
[2024-09-03T00:27:54] Yamal: but today's ultra what a beauty
[2024-09-03T00:28:10] Yamal: portable and powerful
[2024-09-03T00:42:46] Yamal: Ebmx controller are vesc 🤯
[2024-09-03T00:42:47] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-03T00:49:44] haku: is it?

[2024-09-03T00:51:08] haku: can you access vesc tool and opensource these?
[2024-09-03T00:52:05] haku: thats cool
[2024-09-03T00:52:21] Yamal: I don't know exactly what they mean by using a modified vesc base,,
[2024-09-03T00:53:23] haku: how much is that vesc? i dont see prices on the website. must be expensive if thats the case
[2024-09-03T00:53:32] Yamal: 1000A phase continuous…
[2024-09-03T00:53:37] Yamal: 500A batt

[2024-09-03T01:06:26] Yamal: The issue is how many phase Amperes do the new generation of LY motors support efficiently and with stress??? 350//400A, from there they start to get very hot? @PaoloWu
[2024-09-03T01:07:25] haku: good question. i believe @jamessoderstrom said 33x2 70h around 300 400
[2024-09-03T01:09:35] Yamal: In the end, having more than enough power would allow us to be able to withstand those 300 to 400 phases in a more comfortable and lasting way with freezing temperatures.
[2024-09-03T01:14:02] Face de Pin Sucé: You could come to watch the races also
[2024-09-03T01:14:50] Yamal: and you let me take a spin in the lambo ^^
[2024-09-03T01:26:28] haku: thats why smaller vescs perfect for scooters. these huge escs just overkill i think
[2024-09-03T01:27:55] haku: dam neighbors dog bit me. i was just trying to help it get back in the house. so hot outside
[2024-09-03T01:31:17] haku: i forgive him. he was just protecting his house.

[2024-09-03T05:47:38] haku: this kind of bolt not to strong eh?
[2024-09-03T05:48:12] haku: need the big black bolts. alot stronger
[2024-09-03T07:39:11] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Good morning friends, yesterday I had to calibrate the throttle again and detect the rear motor. What parameters do I have to copy from the front motor? Only current an FOC or something else?
[2024-09-03T07:40:23] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: What problem do you have? Are you losing water?
[2024-09-03T07:49:43] Lieven L.: Performance models usually don't since smaller cells are easier to cool and therefore offer better performance. Plaid is still 18650.
[2024-09-03T07:52:04] puneDir: Guys i want to add wheelie controll to my vesc

[2024-09-03T13:06:45] 'lekrsu': The balancing connector is not identical.
[2024-09-03T13:09:06] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So ? What will I need to do ?
[2024-09-03T13:09:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And I don't know how to reprogram bmss
[2024-09-03T13:11:10] 'lekrsu': Your existing BMS seems to have two connections disconnected, meanwhile the other bms you linked does not, but rather have the last two bridged. Different JST size. So you'll need to solder it just as they say to the new connector.
[2024-09-03T13:11:41] 'lekrsu': You open their app and set the parameters you want. Default is mostly fine, but some things are up to the user.

[2024-09-03T13:14:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Couldn't find something more similar
[2024-09-03T13:14:35] 'lekrsu': Is discharge mos hitting higher temps than you want? Otherwise why even swap in the first place
[2024-09-03T13:15:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm planning to open 2 84100hp to 70 and 60 a battery
[2024-09-03T13:16:21] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And the continues of mine is 80a

[2024-09-03T13:20:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Or what I have is enough?
[2024-09-03T13:20:38] GABE: The ones that go into phase
[2024-09-03T13:22:07] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If I add 22s magnets and other things to the battery, would I have to add something else or just those 3 things?

[2024-09-03T13:23:35] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I mean 22s 54 ah I also added the magnetic poles of the motor wheel diameter….

[2024-09-03T13:37:48] 'lekrsu': Can your cells even deliver?
[2024-09-03T13:37:59] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes
[2024-09-03T13:48:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Nmc cells can be lithium ion yes ?
[2024-09-03T13:54:49] Mirono escooters: Huh?

[2024-09-03T13:59:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Lfp and nmc has lithium ok I just researched
[2024-09-03T14:28:17] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I added the battery data along with the engine data, wheel diameter and so on. I also added curren and FOC but I don't know if I'm missing something else.

[2024-09-03T17:51:19] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I am 22
[2024-09-03T17:51:21] haku: good idea. space so limited in this frame
[2024-09-03T17:52:46] ElectricPowa: My last set up was 22s....and with 22s impossible reach more of 135 km/h with 22/3 engine. But my old set up was with Kelly so whitout field wakening....I think with a good vesc and field you can reach similar result to a high speed engine. If you run controllers without field so 26s.
[2024-09-03T17:53:25] ElectricPowa: And obviously with a lot less Amps.....
[2024-09-03T17:54:11] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I have 22s motors 33x2 controller 3schul but not much discharge
[2024-09-03T17:55:01] ElectricPowa: Yeah is so little and cute 🥰 Try if possible make a base between the sit and the handle I think here is the best position. Near the sit no or is wheeles all the time 😢
[2024-09-03T17:55:16] ElectricPowa: Magnets ? 75h?
[2024-09-03T17:55:21] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 70
[2024-09-03T17:55:38] ElectricPowa: How speed you have reach?
[2024-09-03T17:56:13] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 126 with 70 fw
[2024-09-03T17:56:17] ElectricPowa: 22/3 work so good. I prefere a lot for do corners are more gentle in the exit of power
[2024-09-03T17:56:47] ElectricPowa: Not bad....
[2024-09-03T17:57:46] 'lekrsu': so much fwk
[2024-09-03T17:57:47] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2024-09-03T17:57:53] ElectricPowa: I don't know how.....my last project for a client with a 20s 10p of Samsung 50e 2 Kelly 7218n and 60h high speed engine have do 138 km/h gps.....the client was shocked
[2024-09-03T17:58:13] ElectricPowa: <video_file>
[2024-09-03T17:58:48] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: We are doing tests but I had to do the rear motor detection but I don't know how to do the configuration. I am copying the data from the front motor but I don't know if I am leaving something out. I copied Curren FOC and also put the battery data and wheel diameter but I don't know if I am leaving something out.
[2024-09-03T17:58:57] ElectricPowa: And mee too. I was thinking reach like 130.
[2024-09-03T17:59:23] ElectricPowa: You have anti slip control on you're shull ?
[2024-09-03T17:59:40] ElectricPowa: I have gear go foc go really good.
[2024-09-03T17:59:41] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: ?
[2024-09-03T18:00:25] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes I know that's why I set it to 0 to try it out little by little.
[2024-09-03T18:00:32] ElectricPowa: A think when you accelerate lock the spin of the front wheel and pass the power in Amps to the rear wheel . Anti slip.
[2024-09-03T18:00:53] ElectricPowa: You can go our a corner accelerate max and the front wheel don't spin.
[2024-09-03T18:01:06] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Well, I couldn't tell you that.
[2024-09-03T18:01:12] ElectricPowa: Is so so cool for sure stay people know of what I'm talking
[2024-09-03T18:01:38] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: traction control

[2024-09-03T18:02:10] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes my bike has it
[2024-09-03T18:02:35] ElectricPowa: You have try put off and see if reach more velocity?
[2024-09-03T18:03:00] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I couldn't tell you, I don't know how to program Vesc
[2024-09-03T18:03:32] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I understand more about mechanics and adapting things
[2024-09-03T18:04:58] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: But I don't want to try to make sure that the data I copied is correct and that I'm not missing any.
[2024-09-03T18:08:57] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: In short, I can't test anything without first making sure I haven't forgotten anything or someone would be kind enough to configure it.

[2024-09-04T23:08:37] haku: the motor on that is it geared hub or direct drive?
[2024-09-04T23:09:02] Finn: Its geared
[2024-09-04T23:09:18] Finn: And phase cable like 2m long so i cannot go over 11A phase
[2024-09-04T23:09:29] Finn: If i increase it ill get stuttering
[2024-09-04T23:09:36] haku: how does geared hub perform witg vesc?
[2024-09-04T23:09:41] Finn: Maybe anyone knows how to fix that😂
[2024-09-04T23:09:45] Finn: Good

[2024-09-05T11:16:05] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: How ?
[2024-09-05T13:20:06] GABE: What's the range?
[2024-09-05T13:20:44] Finn: Didnt test it yet
[2024-09-05T13:24:40] GABE: Why is it just not worth it to go over 20s? other than the components being so much more expensive.
[2024-09-05T13:24:55] GABE: is it because going faster is pretty much illogical?
[2024-09-05T13:39:54] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: that's the game, the first also get the same penalty then that change nothing, but what I am very angry it's last time I loose one race when I was 2th because I can't charge my scooter in there and I start at 50% of battery, I cut battery at 2 turn to end, I am very angry about it, I loose my podium that day because of the organization of shit and my kindness for the rest, it's my fault, I just had to check better my brake system but so, not 100% my fault, my hope brake caliper had factory default on one seal who make loose a bit of brake fluid, little by little it end the entire reservoir and then no brake anymore, that's what happened
[2024-09-05T13:44:21] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: <video_file>
[2024-09-05T14:00:48] Jason: <sticker>
[2024-09-05T14:10:18] Finn: 25kmh is legal in germany
[2024-09-05T14:10:24] Finn: Any faster wouldnt make sense
[2024-09-05T14:13:01] GABE: Assuming 20s already does 200kmh with 22x3, then like... is it even physically possible to go even faster?
[2024-09-05T14:13:12] GABE: Like probably not? wouldn't the scooter just act as a parachute
[2024-09-05T14:13:18] GABE: and fly upwards.
[2024-09-05T14:13:37] GABE: Perhaps, would be possible to add literal wings and 2 brushless turbines and fly with the thing
[2024-09-05T14:13:39] Yamal: Who is going to win the championship?
[2024-09-05T14:13:52] GABE: Not theoretical, I'm being dead fucking serious
[2024-09-05T14:14:02] GABE: the power is there
[2024-09-05T14:38:49] Finn: Sure?
[2024-09-05T14:44:03] Yamal: ……
[2024-09-05T14:45:15] Yamal: Here the maximum allowed is 25kmh too, but everyone goes faster, you just have to be careful, nothing more...
[2024-09-05T14:46:45] Yamal: Also going 25kmh in the middle of traffic is dangerous.
[2024-09-05T14:47:26] Yamal: 40/50kmh okeeeeeeeee😁
[2024-09-05T14:48:41] GABE: It's a joke. I was on a bus yesterday and some loser was going sub20kmh on an m365
[2024-09-05T14:48:45] GABE: with a gay ass helmet
[2024-09-05T14:48:55] GABE: Like please just run him over already

[2024-09-05T14:51:25] Finn: The problem is that the bike is for my mother and the motor oversaturated over 11A phase so no way to go faster
[2024-09-05T14:53:26] Yamal: tune it

[2024-09-07T23:26:23] Yamal: But if you like to pull on kilos and you're comfortable, go ahead! look for tribulus 2000 from excited nutrition 😂
[2024-09-07T23:27:37] haku: i do reps too after maxing out. front squats and lunges
[2024-09-07T23:27:59] Yamal: I don't know if your testosterone levels will increase, but I do know that you'll have to get a girlfriend quickly!
[2024-09-07T23:28:20] haku: aint nobody got time and money for that
[2024-09-07T23:28:38] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: How many A's are there in the front motor and how many phases are there in the rear motor?
[2024-09-07T23:31:37] Yamal: tribulus 2000 from scitec, very good! I had the opportunity to try it in 2014 during a training period, curiously, they withdrew it from the market in Spain, and I could never find it again, even online.
[2024-09-07T23:34:00] haku: some supplements they take out the market for some reason. its a cat and mouse game for these. when ban something else new comes out. i dont take anything else but creatine and preworkout atm.
[2024-09-07T23:34:36] haku: maybe time for testostorone replacement therapy. im about that age where it declines
[2024-09-07T23:36:31] haku: either go to the dr. and get it done for $500 a visit or diy it and shoot it myself lol
[2024-09-07T23:40:36] Yamal: Me the same, always take normal and ordinary sports supplements such as protein, bca, creatine, omega 3 pearls, good nutrition, etc. tribulos within what fits is natural, it comes from a plant.. I have always been against testosterone cycles, growth hormone, etc.,
[2024-09-07T23:42:24] haku: i agree. i will only consider that when competing in sports. right now im just doing this for health and maybe one day someone gets trapped in a car and i can dl it and save them.
[2024-09-07T23:43:03] ElectricPowa: Is double insulated
[2024-09-07T23:43:21] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 🏋️
[2024-09-07T23:43:28] haku: also teaching my boy proper form over weight is important to me
[2024-09-07T23:43:37] ElectricPowa: You can do it. Kwled can solder 0.4......of copper
[2024-09-07T23:44:37] ElectricPowa: But always put a 0.15 on the top of níquel for transfer more heat and use a good Flux.
[2024-09-07T23:45:07] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I think I know you, you are a friend of Estanco?
[2024-09-07T23:53:27] Yamal: The gym you have set up at home is cool, When you have the e-bike mini moto ready, you will be the one at the helm of the ship in your neighborhood xD
[2024-09-07T23:53:48] Yamal: haku rider strikes back😁
[2024-09-07T23:57:42] haku: this is the new boss. i did not even ask him to lift it. its his bodyweight.
[2024-09-07T23:58:10] Yamal: 😁🤙
[2024-09-07T23:58:24] Yamal: Look the boos
[2024-09-07T23:58:43] haku: i dont let him lifting heavy tbh.
[2024-09-07T23:58:58] haku: just bodyweight stuff
[2024-09-07T23:59:05] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-09-08T00:01:36] haku: also its good to have weights at home. unload anytime. no more driving or scooting to the gym just to wait for equipment to free up. lots of mongoloids there too
[2024-09-08T00:02:13] Yamal: you are like maui
[2024-09-08T00:05:06] Yamal: a lot of people taking photos in the mirrors and flirting with women😁
[2024-09-08T00:06:03] haku: exactly. gym is different now than how it used to be.
[2024-09-08T00:06:24] haku: unless its a mma gym.
[2024-09-08T00:06:25] Yamal: They don't know what the Romanian deadlift or the jaka
[2024-09-08T00:07:00] Yamal: They only do biceps and chest,,
[2024-09-08T00:07:18] Yamal: and the legs like two wires
[2024-09-08T00:07:38] haku: yes. dont get me wrong machines are good for isolation but it will not build stregnth
[2024-09-08T00:08:27] haku: good for looking good only pumped muscles
[2024-09-08T00:08:52] Yamal: I'm not saying that machines are bad, the pulleys are the rod, I love rowing for example.
[2024-09-08T00:09:59] Yamal: The rowing gives you body thickness, you widen the box, and the bullpi makes your heart bigger.😂
[2024-09-08T00:10:11] haku: agreed. folks think that legpress is the same as a back squat lol
[2024-09-08T00:11:35] Yamal: I know that one day I will get back into training hard, but first 170 on a scooter
[2024-09-08T00:12:25] haku: need agility training for scooters. very different muscles working
[2024-09-08T00:13:19] Yamal: having trained and strong legs is key for racing
[2024-09-08T00:15:47] Yamal: but yes for scooter you have to be agile
[2024-09-08T00:16:43] haku: agility and coordination if i was to train a scooter driver
[2024-09-08T00:25:53] Yamal: but come on now the priority is to see the flying scooter, and looking forward to starting a new project
[2024-09-08T00:26:26] haku: what frame are you thinking?
[2024-09-08T00:26:49] Yamal: All 😂
[2024-09-08T00:27:31] Yamal: I passed the day seeing scooter models and models,, vesc,, engines,,
[2024-09-08T00:28:05] haku: g30 baby
[2024-09-08T00:28:48] haku: do a lightweight one
[2024-09-08T00:28:49] Yamal: I want power, not too much weight, top torque, good cells, good brakes,
[2024-09-08T00:29:34] Yamal: I still haven't gotten the heavy scooter I want.
[2024-09-08T00:30:01] haku: do a 30s with seven all internal on a g30. that will be mindblowing
[2024-09-08T00:30:42] haku: 30s 3p lol
[2024-09-08T00:32:38] Yamal: the g30 comes late, with engines 75 h to go buy bread
[2024-09-08T00:33:30] Yamal: Actually the motors that I would like to buy are 75h speed
[2024-09-08T00:34:20] Yamal: neither 70 nor 80 nor 90 just 75
[2024-09-08T00:35:09] haku: does 5mm really make a huge difference in magnet size?
[2024-09-08T00:37:00] Yamal: supposedly the 75h has a little more torque than the 70h, however at top speed the opposite happens?
[2024-09-08T00:37:33] haku: does 10" and 11" motors have the same stator diameter?
[2024-09-08T00:37:45] haku: or only difference is the rim?
[2024-09-08T00:38:48] Yamal: I think everything is bigger on the 11", but I'm not sure.
[2024-09-08T00:40:02] haku: @jamessoderstrom is 11 and 10 inch motors have the same stator diameter?
[2024-09-08T00:40:10] haku: i must consult the wise
[2024-09-08T00:43:25] Yamal: It's also cool to take any type of scooter and put a vesc on it,, I would take all the dualtrons or kaboo or any halfway decent and cool scooter and I would put vesc on them xD
[2024-09-08T00:44:13] haku: it is cool. i just dont want to lose the display. thats ehats preventing me from doing that
[2024-09-08T00:44:20] Yamal: set up a shop for the "only vesc" transformation and free all our scooters from the curse
[2024-09-08T00:44:24] Yamal: XD
[2024-09-08T00:44:42] haku: show that photo of benjamin again
[2024-09-08T00:44:55] haku: i need to see the master
[2024-09-08T00:45:11] Yamal: <photos/photo_17415@08-09-2024_00-45-11.jpg>
[2024-09-08T00:45:16] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-09-08T00:45:36] haku: see that smile right there. that means trampa money baby
[2024-09-08T00:46:54] Yamal: Yes, but when I found out I was cheating, that their team is not very competent, and they don't represent Vedder.
[2024-09-08T00:46:58] haku: viking dna im telling you. they evolved with big brains. thats why they have big necks and shoulders
[2024-09-08T00:48:07] haku: dam i did not know that. such a smart man to be suckered
[2024-09-08T00:48:51] Yamal: It was talked about on the general Vesc channel, do you remember? this man We need a team of enthusiasts who want to work and make incredible things.
[2024-09-08T00:49:17] haku: i dont pay attention to general that much lol
[2024-09-08T00:51:43] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-09-08T00:52:06] haku: ok i see. makes sense now.
[2024-09-08T00:52:31] haku: i must be half asleep on candy when i read that
[2024-09-08T00:53:12] Yamal: Same stator diferent magnet
[2024-09-08T00:53:41] Yamal: but all the motor winding the same?
[2024-09-08T00:53:55] haku: how is that possible. same magnet count. its prolly just the rim is the difference
[2024-09-08T00:54:13] Yamal: I don’t now..
[2024-09-08T00:54:19] haku: maybe idk.
[2024-09-08T00:54:24] Yamal: Just I asking
[2024-09-08T00:54:45] haku: not me. im also curious
[2024-09-08T00:54:53] Yamal: @PaoloWu industries now
[2024-09-08T00:55:12] haku: comparing scooter motor wattage to ebike motor wattage. makes sense now
[2024-09-08T00:57:54] Yamal: well the problem with the gt2 is that there is no chassis
[2024-09-08T00:58:48] Yamal: I definitely don't like the inmoion rs, double mast, etc.,
[2024-09-08T00:59:17] haku: inmotion pretty cool imo. lowered stance
[2024-09-08T00:59:35] haku: never seen a upgraded motor one though
[2024-09-08T00:59:38] Yamal: The easiest thing is to prepare a dualtron but it would not be original because it is what everyone does...
[2024-09-08T01:01:09] Yamal: another nami? better than not my wife throws me out the window
[2024-09-08T01:02:44] Yamal: It would also be cool to take a klima and blast at the same time to put the vedder seal on them
[2024-09-08T01:02:45] haku: do something different. something that no one has done
[2024-09-08T01:04:45] haku: what is that scooter that won the el trott french champoinship?
[2024-09-08T01:05:02] Yamal: I don't really know, because this time I will give importance to the geometry and reliability of the scooter, but I'm telling you, there are no frames, only a second-hand scooter, and it is expensive to start that way.
[2024-09-08T01:05:53] Yamal: it hasn't finished yet championship
[2024-09-08T01:06:40] Yamal: MiniWalker tiger ?
[2024-09-08T01:09:36] Yamal: <photos/photo_17416@08-09-2024_01-09-36.jpg>
[2024-09-08T01:09:58] haku: isnt that a zero?
[2024-09-08T01:11:10] Yamal: <photos/photo_17417@08-09-2024_01-11-10.jpg>
[2024-09-08T01:12:11] Yamal: No is miniwaker tiger 10
[2024-09-08T01:12:18] haku: that thing is small
[2024-09-08T01:12:26] Yamal: <photos/photo_17418@08-09-2024_01-12-26.jpg>
[2024-09-08T01:20:39] Noname: https://www.facebook.com/share/r/VzBBSBjzkNPf2ZMq/?mibextid=D5vuiz
[2024-09-08T01:20:56] Noname: @Bradhaku your kid would loose his mind for this
[2024-09-08T01:23:54] haku: i will ride that lol. thats amazing dude
[2024-09-08T01:24:44] haku: i wonder if the stl files are available for that
[2024-09-08T01:40:25] haku: i thought the el trott rules nothing is suppose to be mounted in the stem? looks like that dude has esc on stem
[2024-09-08T04:06:13] Forol1561: yo guys what's the best 20S 5P 21700 cell layout on the G2 without the spacer removed?
[2024-09-08T06:00:01] ElectricPowa: I think you mean stanko. Yes we was friends.
[2024-09-08T06:00:13] ElectricPowa: And he have understand all from me.
[2024-09-08T07:32:08] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I'm not saying that you've taught him, I just think that you're friends, he knows me too, the world is a small place hehe
[2024-09-08T07:40:37] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: So you haven't taught him very well, he made this battery a few weeks ago 🤣 yesterday you told me not to do this design but his student does it ☺️
[2024-09-08T07:43:20] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: https://youtu.be/-WheMdSYVG0?si=MnrjTPJ7hCq34_N-
[2024-09-08T08:08:09] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Is this one fine or would I need more copper sheets? Or is just one fine for 22s11p molicel p45b?
[2024-09-08T09:37:18] Mirono escooters: Do the math, problably fine
[2024-09-08T10:56:34] sombre_enfant: Guys do NIU xqui3 is better than surron ?
[2024-09-08T11:04:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What do you guys say about drilling holes for cooling ? (Hub motor)
[2024-09-08T11:04:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And does a zero10x motor with vesc programed to 30a battery 70a motor and 20a field (75100) should get hot ? Cuze mine does
[2024-09-08T11:07:22] Yamal: No need drilling holes ,, for what ? ^^'
[2024-09-08T11:07:54] Pandalgns: I programed in my janobike motors (52v 1000w) 120phase amp 60a battery 50a field and dont ger hot
[2024-09-08T11:08:05] Pandalgns: With my 84100hp
[2024-09-08T11:08:28] Pandalgns: But only for test riding in the hood
[2024-09-08T11:16:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Cool down a motor
[2024-09-08T11:17:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Try and do 2 km long road and rest twice then let the heat reach motor shell then report to us (if you can)
[2024-09-08T11:19:09] Yamal: For a person who does not enter the circuit and who does not push 350/400A phase, I see it as unnecessary.
[2024-09-08T11:19:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Then why does my motor get too hot then
[2024-09-08T11:24:25] Yamal: By the way, do you know what range of temperatures are "normal" when the engines are working? perhaps on a long and happy route...
[2024-09-08T11:35:25] Yamal: Well, I have no idea... let's see if someone from the group answers, it would be good to learn something about motorcycles, electric bikes with vesc
[2024-09-08T11:37:32] Yamal: <photos/photo_17420@08-09-2024_11-37-32.jpg>
[2024-09-08T11:47:32] GABE: that's a real family
[2024-09-08T11:49:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Not really but I do know it doesn't supposed to give me a burn
[2024-09-08T11:53:05] Mirono escooters: Dont drive through dirt. Or rain. Or anything :)
[2024-09-08T11:53:14] Mirono escooters: Only good for track imo
[2024-09-08T12:05:33] Yamal: https://youtu.be/Aj25xrdOZE4?si=fUDX26M-aHx2JoZF
[2024-09-08T12:16:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm going to share my settings and if u can tell me what is wrong and why motor is getting hot pws
[2024-09-08T12:30:13] haku: no. surron has a big aftermarket
[2024-09-08T12:37:06] Yamal: https://youtu.be/DG_44758hV0?si=XZmg36Vh7o7xjSrr
[2024-09-08T13:11:54] ElectricPowa: You have more drop voltage like this. I have do the 2 version.....
[2024-09-08T13:13:07] ElectricPowa: I was putting down around 400 Amps and I'm 100 kilos. Definitely needed. Drop voltage was like 4 volts at 390 amps. Of battery . No phase.
[2024-09-08T13:13:51] ElectricPowa: With this draw was like 8-9 volts drop
[2024-09-08T13:14:56] ElectricPowa: And also the copper cutted like this....is a risk on the positive . A big risk
[2024-09-08T13:20:43] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, I have seen that some tips are very close to the negative
[2024-09-08T13:24:55] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Can't find the bt so it'll have to wait
[2024-09-08T13:27:41] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I weigh 75 I don't think I have that much voltage drop now I have 10 volts drop with the same battery but with LG m50lt cells
[2024-09-08T13:55:38] ElectricPowa: This is so dangerous. Not how much are near. Is like a knife in that's points. And if cut is fire. The guy have do the battery don't know really how work.
[2024-09-08T13:56:15] ElectricPowa: Just think is a heavy battery. And if stay pressure in that point.....
[2024-09-08T13:56:40] ElectricPowa: Stanko have do you the battery ?
[2024-09-08T13:56:55] ElectricPowa: I recognize the table hahahaha
[2024-09-08T13:57:25] Mirono escooters: I can't see much wrong?
[2024-09-08T13:57:28] Mirono escooters: He even got fishpaper
[2024-09-08T13:57:55] Mirono escooters: If the batt gets so much bend it cuts through that, you've got other issues
[2024-09-08T13:58:08] ElectricPowa: Never go with níquel orncopper on the positive sharped like this. Can cut and do a short circuit.
[2024-09-08T13:58:32] Mirono escooters: Yeah it's avoidable but 🤷
[2024-09-08T13:58:36] Mirono escooters: Without fishpaper I may agree
[2024-09-08T13:58:47] ElectricPowa: <photos/photo_17422@08-09-2024_13-58-47.jpg>
[2024-09-08T13:59:04] ElectricPowa: Better do a shape directly of the positive like this.
[2024-09-08T13:59:21] ElectricPowa: So the níquel don't is sharped and can't cut the protection
[2024-09-08T13:59:51] ElectricPowa: Think is a 14 kilos battery. I have see battery burned for this same issue. Is my work I do battery lithium for work.
[2024-09-08T14:00:35] Mirono escooters: Me too :)
[2024-09-08T14:00:40] ElectricPowa: <video_file>
[2024-09-08T14:00:43] Mirono escooters: Yes can agree
[2024-09-08T14:01:35] ElectricPowa: Really nice !!! A person for change of opinion is always good to know 😁
[2024-09-08T14:01:53] Mirono escooters: Many builders here
[2024-09-08T14:01:54] Mirono escooters: Big community
[2024-09-08T14:02:42] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: He doesn't have papers, he's illegal, hahaha
[2024-09-08T14:23:21] GABE: Just realized a 20s6p P42 can so fit in here. Making two of them will be so good cause it'll be interchangeable. Oh also, are there any smaller QS motors for these? Making it high power would be fun.
[2024-09-08T14:27:07] Yamal: Nice proyect
[2024-09-08T14:27:32] Yamal: Don’t know about mini QS..
[2024-09-08T14:28:21] GABE: Getting paid for the first 50% of the G30 project in a week.
[2024-09-08T14:28:26] GABE: Damn time flies tf
[2024-09-08T14:28:44] GABE: Been so much waiting
[2024-09-08T14:28:48] Yamal: Waiting to see 70h on g30
[2024-09-08T14:28:54] GABE: October.
[2024-09-08T14:29:01] Yamal: 🤲
[2024-09-08T14:29:02] Finn: Still 3d print cellholder have tight tolerances and are better vor overall heat transfer between the cells
[2024-09-08T14:29:26] Finn: If there is fishpaper on top of the battery theres no way for air to circulate
[2024-09-08T15:36:04] ElectricPowa: Yes stay but is white. Are two white protectors and two insulation transparent. The second one go on top of the second protector white. For have more protection.
[2024-09-08T15:36:28] ElectricPowa: <sticker>
[2024-09-08T15:38:10] ElectricPowa: Always better a holder. But sometimes the space don't permit. I put double thermo for have a 360 insulation. I don't put paper between series also for this.

[2024-09-09T00:14:06] haku: the first guy is that tiger miniwalker?
[2024-09-09T00:14:49] Yamal: Yes ,, we talk about he before

[2024-09-09T00:46:07] haku: cholo is not the same as the cartels. cholos are street gangs while cartels dont fuck around doing low key crime.
[2024-09-09T00:48:19] Yamal: MoliMoli !!!!!!!
[2024-09-09T00:49:08] haku: ive been procrastinating dam i thought i would finish the 40t before frame comes. but i guess ill just build the moli pack already
[2024-09-09T01:00:08] Yamal: Well, are you going to start with the 40t first? Do you already have the BMS installed?
[2024-09-09T01:01:27] haku: yes i have all the parts. just need to attatch the bms to the 40t or go straight to building the p42 and finish 40t after
[2024-09-09T01:01:52] haku: i dont even have an external bag for the 40t yet
[2024-09-09T01:03:06] Yamal: Your 40t almost ready..
[2024-09-09T01:03:39] haku: i must consult the battery lords
[2024-09-09T01:03:49] Yamal: The minibikemoto does not have a battery compartment?
[2024-09-09T01:04:29] haku: it does it fits 20s12p
[2024-09-09T01:04:45] haku: i have to double check its a wierd folded layout
[2024-09-09T01:06:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: @NetworkDir Bro got haircut in the middle of the street
[2024-09-09T01:06:40] Yamal: If it has a battery drawer you can put your 40t well wrapped up so it doesn't get cold.
[2024-09-09T02:39:44] Forol1561: Tpu
[2024-09-09T02:39:50] Forol1561: <sticker>
[2024-09-09T02:41:54] Forol1561: Guys....? What do yall say to silicone oil sealed passive pack immersion cooling?
[2024-09-09T04:17:05] Jason: hmmm vesc display with this would be grewt
[2024-09-09T04:45:55] GABE: weird layout? why?
[2024-09-09T04:46:27] GABE: 12p is basically only fold at cath-anodes on bottom
[2024-09-09T04:48:01] Forol1561: Just cause
[2024-09-09T04:48:08] Forol1561: <sticker>
[2024-09-09T04:48:55] Forol1561: Welp cause the cell spacing gona be like zero to none.... + 20S5P with dubble 65H on samsung 50S gona be wild🤣
[2024-09-09T04:49:13] haku: 2 of these folded like a surron battery.
[2024-09-09T04:49:27] GABE: too much work
[2024-09-09T04:49:43] Forol1561: Naah.... Just yeet seal and done
[2024-09-09T04:49:59] GABE: If you're insane then do it
[2024-09-09T04:50:29] haku: maybe there will be more space. idk but these are the dimensions of the battery case
[2024-09-09T04:50:49] GABE: thought you meant double 6p sandwich
[2024-09-09T04:50:58] Forol1561: Heheeee
[2024-09-09T04:50:58] GABE: or 12p decker
[2024-09-09T04:51:03] Forol1561: <sticker>
[2024-09-09T04:51:07] GABE: .
[2024-09-09T04:51:33] GABE: oh it is
[2024-09-09T04:51:35] GABE: I'm just stoned
[2024-09-09T04:51:52] haku: 12p folded. its suppose to fit this white box. the battery on the bottom is 20s10p
[2024-09-09T04:51:59] Forol1561: Btw..... I may have found a way to fit 20S 6P without floor extension with dubble motor 😑
[2024-09-09T04:52:13] Forol1561: Mabye even 7P
[2024-09-09T04:52:15] GABE: wait something is wrong with that picture
[2024-09-09T04:52:29] Forol1561: Anywhere
[2024-09-09T04:52:44] haku: its more of a square rectangle whatever this shape is identified nowadays
[2024-09-09T04:52:55] Forol1561: What do yall think of this?
[2024-09-09T04:52:55] Forol1561: <photos/photo_17451@09-09-2024_04-52-55.jpg>
[2024-09-09T04:53:00] GABE: <photos/photo_17452@09-09-2024_04-53-00.jpg>
[2024-09-09T04:53:05] GABE: this is 12p when doubled
[2024-09-09T04:53:06] GABE: tf
[2024-09-09T04:53:07] Forol1561: For a G2 20S 5P pack
[2024-09-09T04:53:10] GABE: this pack is all messed up
[2024-09-09T04:53:22] Forol1561: Without the removal of the spacer
[2024-09-09T04:54:08] haku: Noname is this right? idk i just follow the guide
[2024-09-09T04:54:28] haku: it looks right to me
[2024-09-09T04:54:39] Forol1561: This might also be an option... Tho a lot more anoyng one
[2024-09-09T04:54:53] GABE: 120 cells in one floor should be basically 20s6p reversed into 10s12p
[2024-09-09T04:55:02] GABE: doubled to therefore 20s12p as you said
[2024-09-09T04:55:18] GABE: therefore the layout with the X's I posted
[2024-09-09T04:55:25] haku: its 2 10s 12p stacked to make 20s 12p
[2024-09-09T04:55:30] GABE: exactly
[2024-09-09T04:55:44] haku: yes thats what im making
[2024-09-09T04:56:22] haku: we will see tommorow the real dimensions.
[2024-09-09T04:56:35] GABE: why is it 8x long
[2024-09-09T04:57:05] haku: what do you mean? its going to be stacked.
[2024-09-09T04:57:27] GABE: You'll know if it's right anyways
[2024-09-09T04:58:06] haku: nowadays who knows whats right and wrong. elon help these people
[2024-09-09T04:58:36] GABE: The word is prism
[2024-09-09T04:58:41] GABE: 💀

[2024-09-09T05:08:53] haku: i actually have ism too.
[2024-09-09T05:09:07] Noname: It's honeycomb layout
[2024-09-09T05:09:53] GABE: bms where
[2024-09-09T05:09:56] Noname: That pic is 12p 10s x2 = 12p 20s
[2024-09-09T05:10:08] Noname: How it's gonna fit white box idk?
[2024-09-09T05:10:11] GABE: this is just 120cell layout with extra steps most likely
[2024-09-09T05:10:17] haku: thats what i see too
[2024-09-09T05:10:44] GABE: wires and copper where
[2024-09-09T05:15:38] GABE: <photos/photo_17454@09-09-2024_05-15-38.jpg>
[2024-09-09T05:15:43] GABE: why not like this
[2024-09-09T05:16:04] haku: same layout
[2024-09-09T05:16:22] haku: its will not fit like that
[2024-09-09T05:18:01] Noname: Doesn't look like it will fit at all though
[2024-09-09T05:18:35] Noname: <sticker>
[2024-09-09T05:18:54] GABE: what is the cell for even
[2024-09-09T05:18:59] Noname: Hey needed to see layout lol
[2024-09-09T05:19:00] haku: that ones a victim of late term abortion.
[2024-09-09T05:19:17] GABE: both cells
[2024-09-09T05:19:19] GABE: this and that one
[2024-09-09T05:19:27] GABE: and why u not using it?
[2024-09-09T05:19:42] haku: ill use both.
[2024-09-09T05:19:59] haku: 40t as range extender and p42 internal
[2024-09-09T05:20:08] Noname: How if.it doesn't fit box
[2024-09-09T05:20:14] GABE: which scooter
[2024-09-09T05:20:25] haku: minibike scooter
[2024-09-09T05:20:34] GABE: do show
[2024-09-09T05:21:21] haku: <photos/photo_17455@09-09-2024_05-21-21.jpg>
[2024-09-09T05:21:31] haku: mans ride
[2024-09-09T05:21:51] haku: 13" tires
[2024-09-09T05:21:54] GABE: that with like 50kw would be insane
[2024-09-09T05:21:55] Noname: I went to the beach today. That is all, back to haku's non fitting battery
[2024-09-09T05:22:06] GABE: shit on motorbikes with that
[2024-09-09T05:22:29] haku: thats nice bro! hows the watee? cooling down a bit?
[2024-09-09T05:22:47] Noname: Idk I hate the ocean
[2024-09-09T05:22:52] GABE: Can't make the cell like this no?
[2024-09-09T05:23:00] haku: nono nothing like that. i dont think the motor can handle that
[2024-09-09T05:23:00] GABE: god knows how much that can fit
[2024-09-09T05:23:09] GABE: 2x 90h can
[2024-09-09T05:23:27] GABE: probably enough to saturate 2 100hs
[2024-09-09T05:23:34] haku: you a fancy boat boy
[2024-09-09T05:23:41] GABE: what ones you got

[2024-09-09T05:24:30] GABE: good project
[2024-09-09T05:24:34] GABE: where will you fit the external
[2024-09-09T05:24:44] GABE: I'd just make a killer internal
[2024-09-09T05:24:48] haku: no idea. im just buiding it from what parts i have atm
[2024-09-09T05:25:04] GABE: <photos/photo_17458@09-09-2024_05-25-04.jpg>
[2024-09-09T05:25:09] GABE: add more here
[2024-09-09T05:25:20] haku: you can buy a basket for the rear 😭
[2024-09-09T05:25:28] GABE: 20s18p deadaas
[2024-09-09T05:25:38] GABE: more
[2024-09-09T05:25:45] Noname: How about a powered wheel trailer with a mega battery
[2024-09-09T05:26:18] haku: i agree more witg this. a sidecar with a battery bottom
[2024-09-09T05:26:31] haku: for my boy and dog
[2024-09-09T05:26:44] GABE: how about an Etank with a kilowatt laser to literally blind an entire city and all military in 1 second (dont tip me off to FBI please)
[2024-09-09T05:27:26] GABE: Nah a drone with a 1kw laser
[2024-09-09T05:27:31] haku: the tech is not there yet. only "semi auto" on a tripod
[2024-09-09T05:27:33] GABE: And shine it across a whole country
[2024-09-09T05:27:41] GABE: Instablind
[2024-09-09T05:27:42] Noname: We just need more range not world domination
[2024-09-09T05:27:45] GABE: thousands of people
[2024-09-09T05:27:53] GABE: This would actually happen
[2024-09-09T05:28:13] GABE: And you only need 1kw of laser
[2024-09-09T05:28:29] GABE: dont even have to look at the beam
[2024-09-09T05:28:38] GABE: can be turned away from it
[2024-09-09T05:28:38] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-09T05:28:42] haku: we prefer bullets in US
[2024-09-09T05:49:45] Forol1561: With dubble esc, bms, 20S 6P
[2024-09-09T05:49:51] haku: im ready for mine now. graduation time baby
[2024-09-09T05:50:10] haku: i already passed the builders checklist for this badboy.
[2024-09-09T05:51:12] Forol1561: MABYE even 7P tho that would require tiny esc and bms
[2024-09-09T05:51:34] GABE: Impossible
[2024-09-09T05:51:51] GABE: 6p already uses 100% of space vertically and you need a spacer
[2024-09-09T05:51:58] GABE: do show the blue prints though
[2024-09-09T05:52:06] GABE: maybe Im just stupid
[2024-09-09T05:52:14] Forol1561: Not verticaly
[2024-09-09T05:52:35] GABE: Vertical Is 100% space efficiency, physics wise.
[2024-09-09T05:52:59] GABE: I stand to be corrected
[2024-09-09T05:53:01] GABE: though
[2024-09-09T05:53:10] Forol1561: Same.... Calculated it at 2am
[2024-09-09T05:53:28] GABE: I didn't figure out that pack was good and I'm sleep deprived.
[2024-09-09T05:53:43] GABE: no sleep makes you into a bell lend
[2024-09-09T05:54:28] Forol1561: Nah.... There is some heardoom for the g2.... Only issue is the lip... That's where u could shove the bms and esc with 6P
[2024-09-09T05:54:45] Forol1561: Real
[2024-09-09T06:12:14] Forol1561: ..... my ass.... I could fit over 20S 8P with room for ESC's and bms.... IF I really wanted to go thru that hastle
[2024-09-09T06:12:40] Forol1561: my calculations are based on an assload of 21700 3d printed dummycells
[2024-09-09T06:13:19] Forol1561: the only issue would be the lip opening.... but there are ways to get around that
[2024-09-09T06:13:19] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Forol1561 has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-09T06:13:45] Noname: Chinese kid on a Chinese made ebike with left over Chinese parts. Can't get more American than this
[2024-09-09T06:16:11] haku: hes chinaman.
[2024-09-09T06:16:19] Yamal: Magic compact and mini controller
[2024-09-09T06:16:21] haku: or chinaboy
[2024-09-09T06:17:29] Yamal: the rider increasingly masters the electric bike better ^^ 💪
[2024-09-09T06:17:44] haku: i up it to 12mph
[2024-09-09T06:17:45] Noname: OK so that's the 3rd Lil rear wheel vehicle I know of 😆
[2024-09-09T06:17:49] Forol1561: vertical cells without room for ESC's would be 147 cells
[2024-09-09T06:18:14] Yamal: The e-bike also looks fast and nervous!
[2024-09-09T06:19:57] Forol1561: horizontal would be 176
[2024-09-09T06:20:03] haku: ive actually seen dirtbikes or surrons with 17 rear 19 front. idk why
[2024-09-09T06:20:07] Forol1561: without ESC's
[2024-09-09T06:20:33] Forol1561: also.... that's without an efficient layout... that's just stacking em
[2024-09-09T06:20:42] Noname: <photos/photo_17459@09-09-2024_06-20-42.jpg>
[2024-09-09T06:21:00] Forol1561: so I think 7P would be NO problem and 8P would be pain in the ass but doable
[2024-09-09T06:21:56] Forol1561: ok.... it might be pain in the ass regardless but still.....
[2024-09-09T06:21:59] Noname: <photos/photo_17460@09-09-2024_06-21-59.jpg>
[2024-09-09T06:22:10] Noname: Dirtbikes are like that
[2024-09-09T06:22:25] Noname: I mean oddly different sizes
[2024-09-09T06:23:40] Noname: 8p 14s
[2024-09-09T06:23:46] Noname: G30 though
[2024-09-09T06:23:46] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Noname has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-09-09T06:24:25] Forol1561: different orientation tho
[2024-09-09T06:24:30] Yamal: Confortable ^^
[2024-09-09T06:24:34] haku: anythings possible baby. necessity is the father of all inventions
[2024-09-09T06:27:36] haku: i rode this around the hood. im suprised it could carry my weight. dropouts still intact
[2024-09-09T06:28:37] haku: you cant out minibike that
[2024-09-09T06:28:46] Yamal: all I'm referring to is the "mini spintend" is doing well in many places...

[2024-09-10T20:37:14] Yamal: I don't know, are there 10" LY motors with 10mm phases the same as the 11" ones? I suppose anything is custom made, but in normal stock I mean...
[2024-09-10T20:55:37] purp: when they were consistent with communicating on whatsapp i was told it was possible so if they can that would be awesome lol
[2024-09-10T20:58:40] Yamal: The klima is cool! The only thing is the battery compartment, if you can make one welded to the frame, with a removable deck, the better, there was already one on Facebook with 21 s, what kind of vesc have you thought about?
[2024-09-10T21:04:58] haku: cutie delivered my frame. idk how she got it up my porch.

[2024-09-11T01:04:43] haku: you can mount mt5 on the right? whuut?
[2024-09-11T01:08:28] haku: these ly cables are too thicc boy. its unnatural.

[2024-09-11T05:40:28] haku: the factory brakes fit if it doesnt. or switch to the thin rotors
[2024-09-11T05:40:29] haku: <photos/photo_17503@11-09-2024_05-40-29.jpg>

[2024-09-11T05:48:59] JPPL: <photos/photo_17504@11-09-2024_05-48-59.jpg>
[2024-09-11T05:50:00] haku: i also need to buy a cutter tool and nipple tool for the brake line. any recomendations?
[2024-09-11T06:14:08] haku: these brakes actually pretty nice. it has a big resiviour and a see thru hole so you can see if topped off.
[2024-09-11T06:15:09] haku: gotcha. thanks

[2024-09-11T07:03:35] Yamal: luxury teverun
[2024-09-11T07:04:21] Yamal: ? G2
[2024-09-11T07:06:22] Yamal: You need a smaller caliper support or a larger disc, which is a better idea for better braking.
[2024-09-11T07:07:13] Forol1561: Yup.... The stock "shocks" literary exploded after like 800km 😑 (I weight around 58-60kg)
[2024-09-11T07:08:11] Yamal: Why you no ask in ninebot group,,there are real geniuses
[2024-09-11T07:09:31] Yamal: a very interesting g2 is being cooked there

[2024-09-11T07:29:59] Yamal: I mean, what is the problem itself? I don't know any idea. By the way, do you have a vesc?
[2024-09-11T07:30:09] haku: im supriesed why scooter motors doesnt have those yet
[2024-09-11T07:31:08] haku: with those fast scooters it would be a big upgrade from bike brakes
[2024-09-11T07:56:14] haku: has anyone used this brakes before? it uses dot 3/4 fluid.
[2024-09-11T09:49:11] Forol1561: Well so far only plans and 3d prints for layout plans

[2024-09-11T14:36:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I checked with another motor (zero10x too) same results is this a firmware issue ?
[2024-09-11T14:42:21] Lieven L.: I'm still waiting for people to realize that bigger wheels are much better offraod. And then booom 21" / 19" wheels + a seat and we all ride e motos.
[2024-09-11T14:58:01] NetworkDir: Firmware - Controller issues yes
[2024-09-11T14:58:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: How do I diagnose if it's controller and not firmware?
[2024-09-11T15:00:48] NetworkDir: What controller are u using exactly?

[2024-09-11T15:03:13] Yamal: 🐬
[2024-09-11T15:03:50] Noname: 10" wheels and 2" suspension isn't great for offroad.
[2024-09-11T15:05:13] Lieven L.: And bigger wheels is better than bigger suspension
[2024-09-11T15:10:13] Yamal: What do you think about Mosphera
[2024-09-11T15:10:49] Yamal: <photos/photo_17509@11-09-2024_15-10-49.jpg>
[2024-09-11T15:13:23] Lieven L.: I'd rather use a Bike/Motorcycle with a seat and storage. I just don't see a real application for such a big scooter.
[2024-09-11T15:15:01] Yamal: But still nice xD
[2024-09-11T15:15:17] Yamal: Surron perfect for you I think heh
[2024-09-11T15:16:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_17510@11-09-2024_15-16-14.jpg>
[2024-09-11T15:16:15] Lieven L.: Surron is much better for comuiting. The only benefit you get from the scooter, it's easier to get on and off.
[2024-09-11T15:17:31] Lieven L.: I guess thats why they target industrial applications.

[2024-09-11T15:24:00] Lieven L.: Well what people like is up to them. But in the end you will see what's really better when you hand both to people for everyday use. aka A-B-Testing
[2024-09-11T15:26:21] Yamal: True
[2024-09-11T15:26:36] Yamal: Seat less accident
[2024-09-11T16:05:51] GABE: College messed up my details again and now I have to wait till Oct to get paid but at least it'll be double
[2024-09-11T16:06:16] GABE: At least I get almost all the money needed to finish the g30, though.
[2024-09-11T16:07:08] GABE: Issue is I would've gotten the first half in a week and proceeded to start the project then. so Thanks to my uni, a little delay.
[2024-09-11T16:07:23] GABE: Payment of over 700. what I need.

[2024-09-11T16:18:21] Rogerio Figueiredo: Hello guys
[2024-09-11T16:19:35] Rogerio Figueiredo: I know flipksy 75100 sucks but I have one laying around with blown gets and I had the fets so I changed it turn on but if you connect the motor it blows even in freewhell anyone knows why
[2024-09-11T16:19:39] Rogerio Figueiredo: <photos/photo_17511@11-09-2024_16-19-39.jpg>
[2024-09-11T16:19:54] Rogerio Figueiredo: What is the catch here anyone knows?

[2024-09-11T16:28:48] 'lekrsu': Well there's supposed to be, shouldnt it
[2024-09-11T16:28:53] Yamal: 70h , 85/250, battery ?
[2024-09-11T16:29:32] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: ought
[2024-09-11T16:30:00] Rogerio Figueiredo: What is the opamps?
[2024-09-11T16:34:53] puneDir: Some component on pcb
[2024-09-11T16:35:00] puneDir: Check fet drivers first
[2024-09-11T16:35:01] GABE: 2x 80100, and half of the 20s12p double.
[2024-09-11T16:35:21] Rogerio Figueiredo: Any schematics of this board?
[2024-09-11T16:36:11] GABE: 20kw, what's that like 0-100 in 3 seconds and 120kmh top speed. will be much too much for me, i have never went more than 70kmh
[2024-09-11T16:36:19] Rogerio Figueiredo: When the 75100 burns fets the should burn something else because 2 friends have same problem replace the fets mad never stay good
[2024-09-11T16:36:31] GABE: and that 70 Being 70 on an unstable stock ximi which will be incomparable.
[2024-09-11T16:36:37] GABE: Stock controller stock motor Surely this setup will satisfy me for months. It'll still be a real 70h g30, by all means I cannot even imagine how it would feel to drive a 20kw scooter, haven't dreamed of it.
[2024-09-11T16:43:03] Yamal: I think you have in your list, 85/250👍
[2024-09-11T16:43:18] GABE: With the double 6p I'll get 26kw with the 80100 which james says he has achieved with those controllers
[2024-09-11T16:44:03] GABE: then if I want to upgrade controllers for an extra 14kw 26->40 then so be it
[2024-09-11T16:44:47] Yamal: But you have 70h 33/2?
[2024-09-11T16:44:53] GABE: 22x3
[2024-09-11T16:45:19] GABE: so I don't need 12fet rpm
[2024-09-11T16:45:26] GABE: lucky me
[2024-09-11T16:45:39] Yamal: Nice proyect
[2024-09-11T16:45:42] GABE: 26kw will be fire pants on fire

[2024-09-11T16:51:03] Yamal: You will have to show us what a real Maserati is
[2024-09-11T16:51:06] GABE: perhaps getting 80250 will be viable if I ever buy 33/2 stators .
[2024-09-11T16:51:20] GABE: The extra power with medium KV won't be better.
[2024-09-11T16:51:26] GABE: not viable
[2024-09-11T16:51:42] GABE: that will be the next upgrade, which I probably will never do 😂😂😂
[2024-09-11T16:52:17] Yamal: never say never Gabe!! everything comes
[2024-09-11T16:53:30] GABE: So many possibilities when you make your own machine

[2024-09-11T17:00:41] haku: ill be that old guy in campus drinking with the irish girls
[2024-09-11T17:02:05] GABE: very hard to get chosen for a paid scholarship
[2024-09-11T17:02:28] GABE: have to be in the middle payment bracket and even then if you are like 1000$ over you don't get it
[2024-09-11T17:02:30] GABE: it's very rough
[2024-09-11T17:02:45] haku: oh i forgot about those. good work my boy. dont mess this up

[2024-09-11T21:50:23] puneDir: Jk 200a would be fine
[2024-09-11T21:51:08] puneDir: Or just leave it like that
[2024-09-11T21:51:27] puneDir: i must find a way to fit this in zero Rebuilding sucks
[2024-09-11T21:51:53] puneDir: stem?
[2024-09-11T21:51:58] Andrei Albert: Crazyyyyy mannn
[2024-09-11T21:52:26] puneDir: I want gt2rs
[2024-09-11T21:52:38] puneDir: Atleast that batt fits into that
[2024-09-11T21:53:09] Andrei Albert: See the yt videos
[2024-09-11T21:53:32] Andrei Albert: From rage, shows the motor temps too
[2024-09-11T21:53:41] haku: i cany find any. i dont know the french key words
[2024-09-11T21:54:14] Andrei Albert: https://youtu.be/FIRvMWQFl6A?si=fuCfFFErPDSXP_4i
[2024-09-11T21:54:37] Andrei Albert: 3:40 already 112 degrees
[2024-09-11T21:54:56] haku: dang
[2024-09-11T21:55:11] haku: these motors aint built for it
[2024-09-11T21:57:05] Andrei Albert: @SibClimb How he’s driving that hard without steering damp?
[2024-09-11T21:57:12] Face de Pin Sucé: A lot 😂
[2024-09-11T21:58:07] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, with a very well made setup, you can go really fast without steering damper
[2024-09-11T21:58:30] Yamal: But the red one have right
[2024-09-11T21:58:33] Face de Pin Sucé: My pilots use steering damper, not for wobble but for comfort when cornering, to feel better the scooter
[2024-09-11T21:58:52] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, but when I take it on streets, I remove it 😁
[2024-09-11T21:59:44] Yamal: Do you go out and do your errands on that scooter?
[2024-09-11T21:59:49] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-09-11T21:59:54] Yamal: ✍️💃
[2024-09-11T22:00:16] Yamal: Lyon ?

[2024-09-11T22:00:22] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-11T22:00:26] Face de Pin Sucé: Sometimes I use the pleasure of being Rage Mechanics CEO to take my RM-X on the streets, and it's wild 😁
[2024-09-11T22:00:57] Andrei Albert: U gotta flex that rocket
[2024-09-11T22:01:06] Andrei Albert: I would too
[2024-09-11T22:04:06] Yamal: You are going to have coffee and croissant at the RM-X with the 3/4 jacket
[2024-09-11T22:05:07] Face de Pin Sucé: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-YqVX3MsaP/?igsh=aWFjZm9iM2UwYzVm
[2024-09-11T22:05:15] Yamal: The bad thing is that if you flirt with a girl, she should walk
[2024-09-11T22:05:30] Yamal: 🤙🕊
[2024-09-11T22:05:33] Face de Pin Sucé: Sometimes we go out and cross the city very fast
[2024-09-11T22:05:44] Face de Pin Sucé: You can take the girl with you in front no problem
[2024-09-11T22:06:10] Yamal: Is it legal in France? I don't think so
[2024-09-11T22:06:40] Face de Pin Sucé: It's not
[2024-09-11T22:07:18] Face de Pin Sucé: But who cares haha, just smile to the cops and it's okay, as long as you have a cute girl with you 🫢
[2024-09-11T22:07:49] Face de Pin Sucé: I remember during covid lockdown we had very funny chase with cops during the nights haha
[2024-09-11T22:07:57] Andrei Albert: 😆😆 same here in Ro
[2024-09-11T22:09:51] Yamal: The big dilemma is why there are differences between scooters with the same voltage, the same electronics and maybe not the same motors,! professional secret ;) there are many who look and few who talk...😂
[2024-09-11T22:11:48] Yamal: as he once said big of Rafa, the difference makes the difference
[2024-09-11T22:16:20] Yamal: Likewise, the winner is the winner
[2024-09-11T22:19:33] Yamal: have you fled from the law on a scooter?
[2024-09-11T22:20:50] puneDir: And people call this gay
[2024-09-11T22:21:02] puneDir: mostly 125cc bikers 😃😃😃
[2024-09-11T22:21:10] haku: they call him jesse james for a reason
[2024-09-11T22:22:07] Yamal: rebel! like the flower that escaped from the pot
[2024-09-11T22:24:26] GABE: "Gas is cool because its polluting" *Electric more polluting* > Noooo! not like that!
[2024-09-11T22:25:07] GABE: Fled? they didn't even form a thought before you left
[2024-09-11T22:25:20] GABE: Hnm
[2024-09-11T22:25:49] puneDir: Gas is cool but electric is much better
[2024-09-11T22:26:52] Yamal: It's a shame that big scooters are so penalized in your country. :(
[2024-09-11T22:31:40] Face de Pin Sucé: So amazing 🤩
[2024-09-11T22:34:34] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-09-11T22:35:03] Yamal: escape in g30?
[2024-09-11T22:37:14] puneDir: Are they talking about you?
[2024-09-11T22:37:31] Yamal: G30 custom
[2024-09-11T22:39:59] puneDir: Keıekke
[2024-09-11T22:43:37] GABE: Once theres a way to limit heat on motors then RPM will be better on E.
[2024-09-11T22:44:08] GABE: Honestly air intake valve and cyclone type cooling on motors can do it and will be compatible with Nitrous Oxide.
[2024-09-11T22:44:36] GABE: Also can engineer motors to have a turbine turbocharger type fan inside to displace cooling even better DC motors already have this
[2024-09-11T22:45:06] GABE: Having both Gas and Electric compatible with Nitrous would be so much variation for street races etc Although both having different mechanism of action
[2024-09-11T22:47:49] GABE: Can achieve the turbocharger cyclone contraption if the stator is split in two Kind of what drone motors have but not. they have unlimited cooling So so much engineering togo into this but once it's finalizzed it should be 100% stable To be clear, heat is the problem.
[2024-09-11T22:47:49] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-09-11T23:09:36] Yamal: Have you not put the controllers on it yet?
[2024-09-11T23:10:32] Yamal: The Numo industry is very stopped…
[2024-09-11T23:13:23] Face de Pin Sucé: Not yet, but it's a real challenge to do something right inside
[2024-09-11T23:14:02] Yamal: In the same way, it is a shame that companies that make powerful scooters do not bet on vesc, until today only Rion and momen, we will see what the future holds
[2024-09-11T23:16:20] Yamal: It has a controller in front and another in the back, inmotion rs type, and I guess with very little space
[2024-09-11T23:17:06] Face de Pin Sucé: Very little space
[2024-09-11T23:17:11] Face de Pin Sucé: Kelly without enclosure
[2024-09-11T23:17:26] Face de Pin Sucé: And a fan pushing airflow inside, complete bullshit

[2024-09-11T23:22:12] Paolo ⁭: If anyone interested to Nami motor brand new, price is 200€ each.
[2024-09-11T23:23:23] Yamal: https://youtu.be/OGaId3JRdRo?si=8tZJlJflIwx1Ekt8
[2024-09-11T23:23:46] Yamal: Your song 😂
[2024-09-11T23:24:48] Yamal: How is the industry going, Mr. Paolo?
[2024-09-11T23:27:39] Paolo ⁭: Left many times ago, just selling what remains
[2024-09-11T23:29:05] haku: how is buissnes where your from if you dont mind me asking?
[2024-09-11T23:29:48] haku: thinking about being an american vendor
[2024-09-11T23:30:25] Paolo ⁭: Very bad, because of country limitation
[2024-09-11T23:30:41] Paolo ⁭: Everyday new law new rule, made impossible people to drive then
[2024-09-11T23:30:50] haku: dam.
[2024-09-11T23:31:13] haku: here its still the wild west. but im sure laws are coming
[2024-09-11T23:55:15] Yamal: The harassment and demolition against e-scooters is already a bit of a laugh, They are simple vehicles, light, and that do not harm anyone, why this?
[2024-09-11T23:55:44] haku: money baby. taxes and manufacturing
[2024-09-11T23:59:11] Yamal: But if they don't want to provide alternatives, then they should tax €100 a year, you'll see how everyone pays it, but they don't want to do anything.
[2024-09-12T00:00:38] Yamal: Scooters certified by DGT Traffic are now coming out here, which means that they are legal and of course they will continue to be legal after the famous January 2027.
[2024-09-12T00:01:49] Yamal: We have: mantis king gt/ dualtron victor ,, later I see more, but this two are interesting for the size..
[2024-09-12T00:06:51] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-09-12T00:06:53] haku: its all woke politics. tbh
[2024-09-12T00:07:41] Yamal: “Legal” scooter for tune,, I mean after 2027
[2024-09-12T00:15:07] haku: it will be g30 spanish edition
[2024-09-12T00:15:28] Yamal: Also there are G2
[2024-09-12T00:15:31] haku: different color like blue german one
[2024-09-12T00:15:42] haku: and yellow american
[2024-09-12T00:19:41] haku: surron in spain requires registration?
[2024-09-12T00:20:54] Yamal: Yes
[2024-09-12T00:20:58] Yamal: Like moto
[2024-09-12T00:21:06] Yamal: Mopped?
[2024-09-12T00:21:13] Yamal: Small one I mean
[2024-09-12T00:21:19] Yamal: But is good man
[2024-09-12T00:21:19] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-12T00:21:40] haku: how about a fiido seated scooter bike
[2024-09-12T00:23:57] GABE: at least you can get registration.
[2024-09-12T00:24:00] GABE: We can't.
[2024-09-12T00:24:01] Yamal: Fiido I think no can..
[2024-09-12T00:26:49] haku: i need to patch my vsett tubes. and sell it.
[2024-09-12T00:27:03] haku: or get solids. sorry @jamessoderstrom
[2024-09-12T00:27:28] GABE: why no tubeless
[2024-09-12T00:27:30] Yamal: <photos/photo_17536@12-09-2024_00-27-30.jpg>
[2024-09-12T00:27:39] haku: that has been flat 4 times in less than a year

[2024-09-12T00:28:28] haku: cant put tubless on vsett rims
[2024-09-12T00:29:00] puneDir: what would be my top speed with 23s zero
[2024-09-12T00:29:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 140^
[2024-09-12T00:29:23] haku: ide say 200
[2024-09-12T00:29:44] Yamal: <photos/photo_17537@12-09-2024_00-29-44.jpg>
[2024-09-12T00:29:44] puneDir: 100 is the ceiling for the zero ;(
[2024-09-12T00:29:48] puneDir: Tank slapper
[2024-09-12T00:30:26] haku: thats the goto setup for surrons. lol
[2024-09-12T00:30:49] haku: and a 20s battery sticking out
[2024-09-12T00:31:07] Yamal: Those photos are of surron that are sold in Spain
[2024-09-12T00:31:23] Yamal: ?
[2024-09-12T00:31:35] puneDir: 23s
[2024-09-12T00:31:59] Yamal: 23s is good ,, but your motors ?
[2024-09-12T00:32:02] puneDir: 50h
[2024-09-12T00:32:46] Yamal: Well, don't expect something out of the stratosphere, my humble opinion...
[2024-09-12T00:33:41] puneDir: wish i had nami with 60hs :D
[2024-09-12T00:34:00] Yamal: 33/2 other game…
[2024-09-12T00:34:07] haku: motors are mostly voltage agnostic. i learned that from the vesclords
[2024-09-12T00:34:22] puneDir: Motors doesnt care about voltage
[2024-09-12T00:34:38] haku: that what it means i believe
[2024-09-12T00:34:46] puneDir: Yeah
[2024-09-12T00:34:47] Yamal: Nami=17/4
[2024-09-12T00:34:55] puneDir: 16x4 is zero i believe
[2024-09-12T00:35:36] Yamal: buy a couple of speed motors
[2024-09-12T00:36:37] Yamal: The bad thing is that you also needed to change electronics, everything goes hand in hand and in the end all this translates into money
[2024-09-12T00:37:56] haku: this is why i sticked to 20s for this mini bike scooter
[2024-09-12T00:39:14] Yamal: ?
[2024-09-12T00:39:25] Yamal: Ah yea …
[2024-09-12T00:39:34] Yamal: 84v….
[2024-09-12T00:39:50] haku: i have 500 p42s and thought ide be making higher voltage. but need new electronics
[2024-09-12T00:40:12] haku: bms and esc
[2024-09-12T00:41:15] Yamal: Maybe you could start with 40t and spintend to get the hang of the mini ebike and then move on to 30/32s molicel and 3shul or seven, also you can buy tronicx12
[2024-09-12T00:41:45] haku: nah. ill do higher voltage on a real emoto
[2024-09-12T00:41:53] Yamal: :(
[2024-09-12T00:41:54] haku: ill finish tgis first
[2024-09-12T00:42:17] haku: by that time new gen cells are here. better options
[2024-09-12T00:42:45] Yamal: For you, buying x12 is simple... they come from your country and you don't pay taxes.
[2024-09-12T00:43:14] haku: dude. more taxes for american made products. lol
[2024-09-12T00:43:35] haku: i dont know how china/ali is getting away with no taxes
[2024-09-12T00:43:50] Yamal: The one I mean if the controller is 550$ is 550$
[2024-09-12T00:44:02] Yamal: For us no
[2024-09-12T00:44:13] haku: +10% sales tax and shipping
[2024-09-12T00:45:27] haku: this country is so fucked up right now so sad to see american made stuff get taken over by chinese stuff. but when you poor you poor. you feel me
[2024-09-12T00:46:32] haku: also america barely innovates on e scooters or e motos
[2024-09-12T00:46:48] haku: that is all china doing that
[2024-09-12T00:47:07] Yamal: Spain same
[2024-09-12T00:48:27] Yamal: here what is popular are bulls and women
[2024-09-12T00:48:37] haku: i think china is investing on a electric future and the west is still stuck on fossil fuel. like i said there is room for both. its all politics
[2024-09-12T00:49:19] haku: catherine zeta jones. my childhood sweetheart
[2024-09-12T00:49:39] haku: she from spain yea? penelope cruz too?
[2024-09-12T00:49:46] Yamal: Zorro?
[2024-09-12T00:49:51] haku: yes
[2024-09-12T00:50:24] Yamal: Penelope Cruz yes.. Catherine I think not
[2024-09-12T00:51:45] haku: but screw woke hollywood. ivanka trump is my bae now
[2024-09-12T00:51:51] Yamal: Uk girld,,
[2024-09-12T00:52:46] Yamal: Elsa pataky Spain..
[2024-09-12T00:52:59] haku: anyways. back to scooters and motors. western companies should make em too
[2024-09-12T00:53:30] Yamal: You see ?
[2024-09-12T00:53:42] Yamal: Macerati
[2024-09-12T00:53:45] Yamal: Sad….
[2024-09-12T00:54:25] Yamal: They make some brands here, but they are very bad.
[2024-09-12T00:54:31] haku: thats just rebranded chinese crap too
[2024-09-12T00:55:06] Yamal: In any case, China is the factory of the world, production costs, labor, materials...
[2024-09-12T00:55:23] haku: atleast elon invested on ev future.
[2024-09-12T00:55:46] Yamal: We have good components, like brakes, which I know...
[2024-09-12T00:55:55] haku: and i have nothing bad to say about his cars but the gps.
[2024-09-12T00:55:58] Yamal: Tyre..
[2024-09-12T00:56:13] haku: no motors tgough
[2024-09-12T00:56:17] Yamal: All about e-scooter
[2024-09-12T00:56:24] Yamal: Cars don’t care ,,
[2024-09-12T00:56:59] Yamal: I have Volkswagen Passat 2005, and it’s good,, no need more for the moment ..
[2024-09-12T00:57:34] Yamal: A van for the family would be good for the future, little more,
[2024-09-12T00:57:40] haku: im saying evs are good city commuters. short distances and long distances fuel is good
[2024-09-12T00:57:58] haku: price of gas here is insane
[2024-09-12T00:58:19] haku: and most trucks are v8s
[2024-09-12T00:58:44] haku: $200 to fill up a truck
[2024-09-12T00:59:19] haku: filled up my ganmas escalde once. horrible gas milage
[2024-09-12T00:59:19] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-12T01:00:39] Yamal: Lambo
[2024-09-12T01:01:06] Yamal: I get when I life in the north of Spain in 2020
[2024-09-12T01:01:49] haku: we dont get a wagon/hatch version of passat in US
[2024-09-12T01:02:26] haku: or ive never see one. very rare for euro cars to be wagons here. i like it more actually
[2024-09-12T01:03:39] Yamal: Good for family
[2024-09-12T01:04:28] Yamal: Also you can put your baby scooter behind
[2024-09-12T01:04:49] haku: your nami can fit folded?
[2024-09-12T01:05:01] Yamal: <photos/photo_17539@12-09-2024_01-05-01.jpg>
[2024-09-12T01:05:44] haku: cobblestone roads. you dont see that here. amazing
[2024-09-12T01:06:28] Martin Kaktits: What would be optimal amps/ setting for front motor in dual motor setup? Front motor spins out easily with any decent power. I either need to lower phase to something like 70A (booring)or turn on traction control. I wonder whats more optimal for acceleration. How much erpm diff should be allowed in the traction control settings.
[2024-09-12T01:07:22] haku: spain still has alot of old vintage buildings yea? from conquistador era?

[2024-09-12T08:22:08] Rose: Hey there Denis, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-09-12T08:26:53] Denis Shelema: Hello, fellow VESC people! I recently installed a new motor on my electric bike. Like most Chinese motors, it came without any documentation. The seller advertised it as 3000 - 3500 watts, up to 72 volts and 45 mm magnets. Since there is no documentation, I tried to find the right settings experimentally. My equipment: 1) VESC Spintend Ubox 100V 150A controller (FW: 6.05, no hw limits); 2) 48V battery (13s12p, 21700 cells). I gradually increased the battery current with 2A steps and checked how everything works. The phase current limit was set to 240A and did not change during the tests. Regenerative braking was enabled and the current was limited to -10A of battery current. Braking worked well. Eventually, I set the current to 62A and began to accelerate. The motor made a loud clicking sound (more like bang sound). VESC does not trow any error. I immediately stopped and reduced the current back to 60A. With such current everything works fine again. The motor does not make any extraneous sounds. But regenerative braking has stopped working completely. I tried to reduce the battery current, increase the braking current, but nothing helps. I do not understand. This is very strange. If the MOSFETs or motor windings are damaged, then nothing would work. But everything works fine, except for regenerative braking. If anyone understands what is happening, please help me.
[2024-09-12T10:01:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: @punedir when you setup the vescs if setup inside deck I would like to see if and how both vesx fit (if u can send a photo thanks) 🙏

[2024-09-12T11:29:40] 'lekrsu': You can set the foc observer to Ortega original and don't max out the phase values. Try and keep it within 1:1 and a 1:2 span in regards to battery current.

[2024-09-12T12:15:18] Yamal: It is better for the back part of the mast, in my opinion they are less exposed to a collision...

[2024-09-12T19:18:37] NetworkDir: I can help for upload code remotely
[2024-09-12T19:19:29] haku: for sure. ill let you know when i run these vescs. thanks bro
[2024-09-12T19:20:07] puneDir: Less than 20
[2024-09-12T19:25:50] haku: i really need to learn coding and cad. the world is leaving me behind
[2024-09-12T19:27:01] haku: i have vsett display but i think i will sell that scooter. no one will buy that without a display
[2024-09-12T19:29:45] NetworkDir: At least now we have a fixed shitty code lol
[2024-09-12T19:30:54] NetworkDir: Really need a time for rewrite this code
[2024-09-12T19:30:58] NetworkDir: Because cheap and cool
[2024-09-12T19:32:43] haku: what does the display look liks?
[2024-09-12T19:33:47] haku: spintend should really make an affordable display.
[2024-09-12T19:42:46] haku: is it okay for the slots in the disc brake to go this way?
[2024-09-12T19:58:27] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: front or rear?
[2024-09-12T19:59:26] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If it is front it is fine, if it is rear you have to turn it around
[2024-09-12T20:09:50] haku: rear
[2024-09-12T20:10:25] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: should change the meaning
[2024-09-12T21:52:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is it possible 1 vesc 2 motors ?
[2024-09-12T21:55:45] 'lekrsu': No

[2024-09-12T22:37:39] Paolo ⁭: Probably you loose the brake ADC settings, try to set adc again
[2024-09-12T22:37:55] Paolo ⁭: Anyway too high current as James said
[2024-09-12T22:57:21] haku: EU where can i find these knight classes and how much does it cost to join? https://youtube.com/shorts/821qP3HHT7s?si=bOOAkVB6nHrmXt2J
[2024-09-12T23:00:20] GABE: Dead by daylight
[2024-09-13T03:20:52] haku: lockwashers from lonnyo and huameng completely different. i need thier lock washer its taller.

[2024-09-13T06:35:24] Jason: which comm option on vesc is most used
[2024-09-13T06:35:54] Jason: planning for minimum connector vesc
[2024-09-13T06:55:07] Izuna 生活: Not me.
[2024-09-13T08:33:27] Lisa: Yeah yeah , double life
[2024-09-13T08:33:28] Lisa: 🤣🤣
[2024-09-13T11:21:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Why does the only bootloader I see is generic?
[2024-09-13T11:22:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I downloaded another firmware and it does not let me change settings and it says something about no bootloader or som shi
[2024-09-13T12:29:04] GABE: If anyone tries do that to me....
[2024-09-13T12:40:59] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: All the Vesc will use the same bootloader, so each one will have its own fw, I think that's not sure.
[2024-09-13T12:55:09] JPPL: <video_file>
[2024-09-13T12:56:23] JPPL: Obs: when WiFi and BT are both on, display don't have sufficient memory to show display, only shows vesc logo and goes black. Using only one type of connection works
[2024-09-13T12:57:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So I just need to download bootloader first then custom fw ?
[2024-09-13T13:16:14] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I think you have to add the two files and then update the driver. Let the experts confirm this.
[2024-09-13T13:17:14] Lisa: <sticker>
[2024-09-13T13:56:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I don't know which 2 files are u talking about and what drives sorry bro I'm a noob
[2024-09-13T14:06:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2024-09-13T14:25:11] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: These two
[2024-09-13T14:37:02] Patrick: I expected more from the GUI display looks good from the outside but the GUI just looks cheap I must say

[2024-09-13T16:24:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm jealous you got your 84100s before me ahhah
[2024-09-13T16:25:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Don't forget that he Is going to run them at their max amp and voltage
[2024-09-13T16:29:27] haku: that looks great
[2024-09-13T16:39:43] JPPL: Later I show voyager screen Vs official vesc display
[2024-09-13T16:42:39] haku: what?
[2024-09-13T16:43:47] haku: if that happened to me they better kill me because ima sue them biggly.
[2024-09-13T16:43:59] Pandalgns: 2 84100 more??
[2024-09-13T16:45:33] haku: what happened to the old ones?
[2024-09-13T16:46:00] GABE: Slamming their head into the floor.
[2024-09-13T16:46:13] GABE: done it multiple times to people who did shit like that to me.
[2024-09-13T16:46:29] GABE: I've done it to the same person twice
[2024-09-13T16:47:57] haku: i like that. you mean have them open thier mouth into the curb and stomp the back of thier head. then say not welcome. thats pretty badass
[2024-09-13T16:49:38] haku: i think ive seen that in a movie once
[2024-09-13T16:56:46] puneDir: One burned
[2024-09-13T16:56:49] puneDir: Other ones are spare
[2024-09-13T16:56:51] puneDir: Yes
[2024-09-13T16:57:49] haku: why keep buying the same one and expecting a different outcome? just get a different one. a reliable one
[2024-09-13T16:58:30] puneDir: Its already reliable
[2024-09-13T16:58:52] puneDir: Burned 2 times because of flying alu
[2024-09-13T17:14:33] haku: what vesc did you connect this too? g300?
[2024-09-13T17:20:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Already? How
[2024-09-13T17:20:51] puneDir: No old ones
[2024-09-13T17:21:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What do you mean flying Alu ?

[2024-09-13T17:29:54] Yamal: How is this programming possible in 85/150?^^'
[2024-09-13T17:30:47] Pandalgns: Alu dust
[2024-09-13T17:31:11] Yamal: Your friend !
[2024-09-13T17:31:42] Yamal: You know how to make them dance!
[2024-09-13T17:33:11] puneDir: :D
[2024-09-13T17:34:24] Yamal: 2?controller
[2024-09-13T17:37:15] Yamal: But 250A phase for 1 ESC? 🤯
[2024-09-13T17:37:34] NetworkDir: It's phase limit the low kv motor can't touch 250A
[2024-09-13T17:38:17] Yamal: And 150A battery like Fujiguara 85/150 🤯
[2024-09-13T17:44:19] GABE: Id do that but here that's attempted murder
[2024-09-13T17:44:41] GABE: I'm all for beating people but like death type fighting isnt moral.
[2024-09-13T17:45:07] GABE: I wouldn't wanna leave someone brain-dead and having their family take the burden of caring for them
[2024-09-13T17:45:43] GABE: There's a limit to self defense and unfortunately America doesn't see that.
[2024-09-13T17:46:27] Yamal: Let’s go !
[2024-09-13T17:59:36] haku: i agree with this. even as a person that has trained to fight i would never provoke a street fight and always back away. only way if its self defense and life threatening
[2024-09-13T18:00:34] haku: there is also a possibility of a knife in the fight or gun wich is completely different
[2024-09-13T18:13:59] Yamal: Let’s go!
[2024-09-13T18:31:54] haku: this yours?
[2024-09-13T18:32:58] Yamal: no, it's a” work motorcycle”
[2024-09-13T18:33:47] Yamal: We all use it when we need it.
[2024-09-13T18:34:05] Smart Repair: No HW Limit fw
[2024-09-13T18:34:19] Smart Repair: No, single
[2024-09-13T18:35:39] Yamal: on a segway g30?

[2024-09-13T18:36:11] haku: what brand moped is it?
[2024-09-13T18:36:39] Yamal: It's not mine, I'm no longer interested in e-moto only segway
[2024-09-13T18:36:43] Smart Repair: G2
[2024-09-13T18:36:45] Yamal: Silence ..?
[2024-09-13T18:37:04] Yamal: Woyoyoyoy ^^ 👍
[2024-09-13T18:37:36] Yamal: Is 125cc
[2024-09-13T18:38:12] haku: what motor is that if you dont mind me asking?
[2024-09-13T18:38:59] NetworkDir: looks like 65h low kv motor
[2024-09-13T18:39:48] haku: i want an electric moped so bad. ill just count my blessings and settle for seated laotie
[2024-09-13T18:41:14] haku: yep its a thickboi. i wonder wich company makes it
[2024-09-13T18:51:34] Yamal: I want a lambo scooter
[2024-09-13T18:55:16] Yamal: more than 30 kw comfortable and safe hehe
[2024-09-13T18:56:40] Yamal: I don't know how much it will be on the scooter with the new esc, maybe 22/23 kw
[2024-09-13T18:57:37] haku: too much power for standing commuter scooter imo. but pretty badass
[2024-09-13T19:01:50] Yamal: https://youtu.be/DI9-c20q21Y?si=DDBzyiLLZgTQswRu
[2024-09-13T19:01:53] Yamal: You don't like weped's g30?
[2024-09-13T19:03:01] haku: nah. not for me. even if its on sale 50%off i wouldnt buy one
[2024-09-13T19:03:40] haku: some of these scooters your just paying for the brand
[2024-09-13T19:04:07] haku: i like the folded mini bike they make though
[2024-09-13T19:12:45] NetworkDir: Weped is just very expensive don't worth
[2024-09-13T19:13:56] Yamal: :(
[2024-09-13T19:13:59] haku: i have never seen a weped in person. matyer of fact ive only seen a few "hyperscooters" here. maybe 3or 4
[2024-09-13T19:14:56] haku: a nami burn e in 2021 and a gt2 the others i cant identify
[2024-09-13T19:15:14] Yamal: What is a hyperScooter?
[2024-09-13T19:16:08] haku: its a gender of scooters thats big and go really really fast
[2024-09-13T19:16:25] Yamal: There are many points about this, and it's funny, well today it's already a joke...
[2024-09-13T19:16:31] haku: the scooters identify with that name.
[2024-09-13T19:17:18] Yamal: Nowadays companies call everything hyperScooter
[2024-09-13T19:17:37] haku: i did not make this up. its the scooters pronouns. i dont want to offend they/them
[2024-09-13T19:19:25] Yamal: For me, both Nami and the entire Dualtron series, teverun, kaabo, inmotion etc. are not hyperscooters.
[2024-09-13T19:20:07] haku: you have to call them that or you get cancelled
[2024-09-13T19:20:47] haku: we are in 2024. these are not my rules
[2024-09-13T19:21:05] Yamal: big, fast scooters, maybe some high-end models, but not hyperscooters, a hyperScooter has to have it all!!
[2024-09-13T19:22:18] Yamal: nutt brakes on hyperscooter? cst tires?
[2024-09-13T19:22:37] haku: they are called hyperscooters dude. thats thier gender
[2024-09-13T19:23:10] haku: a regular scooter is smaller. hyperscooters are bigger.
[2024-09-13T19:23:38] haku: dont get them/they mixed up
[2024-09-13T19:24:19] Yamal: For me this is a mistake, perhaps if we talk in terms of factory scooter Rion, Velity or momen they are...
[2024-09-13T19:25:05] Yamal: Slack..
[2024-09-13T19:25:11] haku: its not a mistake. they say its science
[2024-09-13T19:25:55] Yamal: These make the difference, without talking about the electronics etc etc that they mount, but they are clearly superior
[2024-09-13T19:26:49] haku: whatever what they call themselves just respect it. do not misgender them
[2024-09-13T19:26:58] Yamal: For me to call an inmotion rs hyperScooter, I don't see it brother!!!
[2024-09-13T19:28:14] haku: i just dont bother anymore arguing with them. i just know in my heart that they are all scooters.
[2024-09-13T19:29:11] haku: i know those scooters that identify as hyperscooters are out of thier mind.
[2024-09-13T19:29:26] haku: but they dont see it
[2024-09-13T19:30:56] Yamal: Hyper”””””” brother “”hyper”””
[2024-09-13T19:30:59] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-09-13T19:31:15] haku: 🤣
[2024-09-13T19:35:19] haku: anyone know what motors these thing use? https://youtube.com/shorts/m-ciiGPMh0A?si=DdnRiZ3XD5Fc3XNM
[2024-09-13T19:37:31] Yamal: You don’t like your 70h ? Or no fit well
[2024-09-13T19:37:56] haku: it fits perfect. im just wondering how this k6 is so fast.
[2024-09-13T19:38:23] Yamal: So much V
[2024-09-13T19:39:05] haku: my 20s setup will not outperform this i think
[2024-09-13T19:41:42] Yamal: 76mph
[2024-09-13T19:42:16] haku: yea. and the acceleration looks good
[2024-09-13T19:42:30] Yamal: 122kmh
[2024-09-13T19:43:20] haku: ill have someone lighter than me test my minibike and sign a waiver when its done.
[2024-09-13T19:43:59] haku: i cannot do it myself. im a pussy
[2024-09-13T19:44:04] Yamal: You eat it with fries, just like the entire Voro team
[2024-09-13T19:45:01] Yamal: I don't think you'll have a problem exceeding 130kmh.
[2024-09-13T19:46:03] Yamal: Seat safe ^^
[2024-09-13T19:46:06] haku: you think. only 20s
[2024-09-13T19:46:44] Yamal: Yes I do with 20 s , 65h 33/2 kelly and no good battery
[2024-09-13T19:46:58] Yamal: 132kmh gps
[2024-09-13T19:47:05] haku: my minibike has a built in damper in the stem. its pretty strange
[2024-09-13T19:48:28] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-09-13T19:49:55] haku: oh man! you got some brass balls boy
[2024-09-13T19:50:25] Yamal: Also now 126 with 22/3
[2024-09-13T19:50:56] Yamal: maybe you exceed 140 no idea
[2024-09-13T19:52:11] haku: did you have to do like half kneel stance to do that?
[2024-09-13T19:52:24] Yamal: speed tests are the best... I could spend the rest of my life doing illegal drag races just for those seconds of adrenaline.
[2024-09-13T19:52:43] haku: full gear yea?
[2024-09-13T19:53:18] Yamal: Full helmet,, ^^'
[2024-09-13T19:54:29] Yamal: The ideal is a complete leather biker suit.
[2024-09-13T19:55:13] Yamal: in case you have to crawl on the ground
[2024-09-13T19:55:50] haku: did you see that weped speed wobble video that i showed you. scary stuff
[2024-09-13T19:56:13] Yamal: Yes ,, first time I see weped like this ..
[2024-09-13T19:58:32] haku: i still need to buy leather gear. ive seen so many used ones that are cheap but it will not fit my fatass
[2024-09-13T20:04:42] Denis Shelema: This is not really a problem. The motor current never reaches the specified 240A. My display for the VESС has a real-time data monitor with the ability to view history (up to 30 minutes). During the test, I monitored the motor current values. They never exceeded 170A with a battery current of 60A. Here is an example of data for a standing start, full throttle. You can see that the motor current (yellow) did not exceed 162A. By the way, with the field weakening enabled, the controller incorrectly limits the battery current. You can see how the current increases to the set limit of 60A, and then the field weakening is triggered and the current smoothly begins to increase to 67A.
[2024-09-13T20:07:46] haku: battery safety tips for all pevs. https://youtu.be/5e7hfFgA7AE?si=AvfdOgmbocmHRz3j
[2024-09-13T20:08:48] Denis Shelema: It seems you are right. I reset all settings and re-ran the motor setup wizard, then re-set the rest of the settings. Everything worked fine again. This is very strange, because: 1) During the test, I only changed the battery current value and nothing else; 2) After realizing the problem with regenerative braking, I checked all the settings and they were fine. In general, something strange happened. The only thing that helped was a complete reset of the settings and their re-setting. Thank you, gentlemen!
[2024-09-13T20:14:49] Yamal: Paolo industries ……,,,
[2024-09-13T20:31:29] Denis Shelema: What do you guys think about my GUI? I developed my own display for VESС. 800x480 resolution. Capacitive touchscreen and external buttons on handlebar. Day/night themes, built-in GPS, fully customizable gauges, customizable driving modes, editable maintenance monitor, real time data monitor with 30 minutes history, FW updates via WiFi, etc.

[2024-09-13T20:34:18] Finn: Anyone got an idea how i can lower the oversaturation?
[2024-09-13T20:34:31] Finn: The phase cable is arround 2m long on my ebike
[2024-09-13T20:36:08] haku: you made that? with a computer?
[2024-09-13T20:36:29] haku: thats pretty cool
[2024-09-13T20:36:43] JPPL: Amazing work
[2024-09-13T20:41:02] Denis Shelema: It is based on ESP32-S3 display module with external GPS module (for precise speed and range measurements), EEPROM module (for odometer and settings data) and GPIO module (for handlebar buttons). I wrote a fairly large firmware. I designed the case, printed it on a 3D printer, sanded it and painted it.
[2024-09-13T20:41:34] haku: that is amazing dude! wow
[2024-09-13T20:44:09] Pandalgns: Wow... incredible
[2024-09-13T20:44:19] Denis Shelema: Not yet =) I'm thinking about making them and selling them, but each one takes a fair amount of time to make and I work full time at my day job, so I'm not sure if it's worth it.

[2024-09-13T20:47:06] haku: try it baby.
[2024-09-13T20:47:32] haku: im wondering too
[2024-09-13T20:48:40] Pandalgns: I think I'm going to need you to teach me something or another about them and about programming, it's a bit difficult for me to get good performance out of them.😅😅
[2024-09-13T20:56:23] 'lekrsu': strange values
[2024-09-13T21:03:15] Patrick: On scooters i like it more simple example ey3 Display, Vsett display and nami but overall this looks pretty good, are you planning to sell them?
[2024-09-13T21:03:48] Denis Shelema: https://t.me/VescHelpGroup/1/262356
[2024-09-13T21:05:05] Patrick: Please ping me if you ever sell them this would look perfect on a conversion bike i am planning
[2024-09-13T21:16:25] haku: hope so. this is what im trying to achieve. a generic k6
[2024-09-13T21:18:19] haku: i will need to build the battery soon.i will need your powers and spirit to guide me
[2024-09-13T21:18:53] haku: just need to balance cells before assembly
[2024-09-13T21:19:30] haku: i have no bag for it yet
[2024-09-13T21:19:55] haku: but yea ill do that first i guess just to get it running
[2024-09-13T21:23:14] haku: they will air ship my brake bracket and some other parts for the stuff they got wrong.

[2024-09-13T21:28:31] Smart Repair: Which settings are responsible for full torque from the start? currently I only do one backflip... but I would like to do a double one 😁
[2024-09-13T21:34:33] Smart Repair: I also go directly to the ADC module. Even with a 0.30 ramp time, the torque only increases slowly.
[2024-09-13T21:43:06] Yamal: <photos/photo_17590@13-09-2024_21-43-06.jpg>

[2024-09-13T21:57:43] Smart Repair: I have exactly the same settings. I will try again tomorrow with 0 seconds ramp time
[2024-09-13T21:57:43] Noname: 134 volt
[2024-09-13T21:59:07] Noname: My buddy's k6 just slightly faster he's a big boy and double the voltage of my vsett.
[2024-09-13T22:01:14] haku: how much do you weigh if you dont mind me asking?
[2024-09-13T22:01:45] Noname: Im a chunky 190 vs prob 300
[2024-09-13T22:02:02] haku: thats huge difference dude lol
[2024-09-13T22:02:22] Noname: He won't officially race though. Just a spirited run on the way home once
[2024-09-13T22:02:49] Noname: I could risk melting wires and accelerate as fast but he's got the top speed
[2024-09-13T22:03:40] Noname: He can't corner for shit though
[2024-09-13T22:04:08] haku: if i was 300 i would too haha
[2024-09-13T22:04:35] haku: luckily i havent peaked yet. 215lbs fatty atm
[2024-09-13T22:04:54] Noname: It's a weird steering and sitting position. I accelerate in corners he hits the brakes lol.
[2024-09-13T22:05:22] haku: folks say you can steer with your feet in the k6
[2024-09-13T22:05:52] Noname: No they're foot plates attached to frame in front
[2024-09-13T22:05:54] Noname: Not steering
[2024-09-13T22:05:56] haku: you know if its 7inch rims or 6.5?
[2024-09-13T22:06:29] Noname: Idk think it's 13" tire. Only segway has 7" right?
[2024-09-13T22:06:46] haku: inmotion too and teverun i think
[2024-09-13T22:12:32] haku: now i have proper bms.
[2024-09-13T22:13:24] haku: pretty much a bypassed battery if i push it

[2024-09-13T23:15:13] haku: all kinds of pussy fat, thin, thick lips, hairy, shaved, mohawk, landing strip, waxed, dyed, pierced, and so on
[2024-09-13T23:18:00] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: The drums you make look very, very good, you know you do it very well, but it is always better for others to give their opinion. If you do it yourself, it is really ugly, but your drums are super.
[2024-09-13T23:19:31] haku: this was my first baby. almost aborted it because it was for a different scooter
[2024-09-13T23:20:11] haku: but i will use it now till i build a proper one.

[2024-09-13T23:23:40] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Let's hope my new battery turns out well. We already have the copper cut to the shape of the series. We are just waiting for the nickel to start soldering.
[2024-09-13T23:24:01] haku: welding you mean yea?

[2024-09-14T14:21:09] Yamal: I cover it because the speed is not real, it is a front engine and the wheel slips sometimes, not for power due to some imperfection in the road
[2024-09-14T14:27:48] NetworkDir: Use traction control for correct max speed
[2024-09-14T14:33:22] Jason: ooh

[2024-09-14T20:24:22] GABE: smoke when i arrive at college, not before ride..
[2024-09-14T20:26:07] Yamal: They try to dehumanize, break up families and go against nature, do you want to fight this? Find yourself a young girl of 23/24 years old and start having children one after the other.

[2024-09-14T20:44:57] haku: do you consider this a hyperscooter?
[2024-09-14T20:45:06] Yamal: No..
[2024-09-14T20:45:38] Yamal: supposedly hyperScooters are not made in a home kitchen
[2024-09-14T20:46:20] Yamal: or that's what I understood a long time ago
[2024-09-14T20:46:35] haku: but that is thier identity
[2024-09-14T20:47:05] haku: must i explain again? the pronouns if these scooters?
[2024-09-14T20:48:35] haku: its like calling a surron an ebike. its not the same
[2024-09-14T20:48:52] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: the tire is upside down ☺️
[2024-09-14T20:50:16] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: change the direction of rotation

[2024-09-14T21:32:28] Yamal: Is that perhaps a monster?

[2024-09-14T21:40:28] haku: dam i need to finish my minibike to attend this.
[2024-09-14T21:44:15] haku: i cannot pullup on a vsett. i might get beat up

[2024-09-15T01:29:14] Yamal: 14 kw continuous... if you mount two you are bordering on 30 continuous...?
[2024-09-15T01:36:16] Yamal: interesting question: How many continuous kw do they give? ubox 85/150 ubox 85/250 ? We will see what power the different Esc have. but of course the continuous kw will vary if we have the scooter raised in the air or if it is circulating. Now I know how to bypass the "Rose" restriction, just have to edit the message .😂 drive safe and be happy! 🫡❤️‍🔥

[2024-09-15T08:35:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Am asking again because I didn't get a clear answer does 75200 dies of bms cut off (in case of hitting peak amps on ant bms)

[2024-09-15T09:47:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: This key
[2024-09-15T09:50:51] Pandalgns: probably removing that cover and making a 3d one with the key ignition in the center
[2024-09-15T09:51:34] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So need to find a 3d project cuz can't make one and dont have a printer
[2024-09-15T09:52:37] Pandalgns: I have 3d printer, and can design 🙄🙄
[2024-09-15T09:52:44] Pandalgns: But im from spain
[2024-09-15T09:53:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Can print in here and I think someone already has a file I don't know how to find
[2024-09-15T09:55:11] Pandalgns: If you find it, let me know, I'm also interested in turning the controllers on and off.
[2024-09-15T10:31:16] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: You can do it with switches. I have one to turn on and off lights and another for the controllers.
[2024-09-15T10:52:39] Pandalgns: Yes but i want a key switch for security 😂😂 gipsy hood
[2024-09-15T10:58:49] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: If he has the same vesc as me (84100hp) he needs normally closed momentary switch hard to find in an handlebar mount
[2024-09-15T12:03:47] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I have some 3D supports for the handlebars. You can find the switch on Aliexpress and then I'll send you a photo of the support.
[2024-09-15T12:04:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Please do
[2024-09-15T12:09:01] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If later when I got home I showed up
[2024-09-15T12:17:41] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: A keyless switch measures the same as a keyed switch: 12mm. I'll send you the photo later.

[2024-09-15T14:49:52] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Heat kills motors and everything we literally can't win
[2024-09-15T15:04:28] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Bearings can reach a working temperature of between 80 and 100 degrees or even more. The problem, as you say, can be water if the bearing is not sealed or does not use a rubber seal.
[2024-09-15T15:22:24] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If it reaches the maximum A the BMS cuts off due to overvoltage. This happens to me but on the contrary it cuts off due to discharge. For safety reasons I have the batteries at 2.9 V.
[2024-09-15T15:23:29] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If the BMS cuts off due to overvoltage or very high peaks, it cuts off the battery current and the controller turns off.
[2024-09-15T16:24:41] Paolo ⁭: Even without the cut off

[2024-09-15T23:38:25] haku: nice!
[2024-09-15T23:38:44] GABE: I'll take the risk to look baller
[2024-09-15T23:38:49] haku: you know your one of us. repent your sins boy.
[2024-09-15T23:42:28] haku: what is an octocupler? sorry
[2024-09-15T23:43:03] haku: gotcha. thanks
[2024-09-15T23:43:45] haku: i wont have a problem connecting in p 40t and p42 yea?
[2024-09-15T23:44:03] puneDir: Im going to get 125cc bike
[2024-09-15T23:44:16] haku: gotcha. thanks
[2024-09-15T23:45:28] Noname: But far is possible
[2024-09-15T23:46:11] Noname: I have 3 batterys connected
[2024-09-15T23:46:15] haku: that wont be an issue with 2 bms yea? never done parralel before
[2024-09-15T23:46:21] puneDir: Yes to 300cc
[2024-09-15T23:46:40] puneDir: <photos/photo_17625@15-09-2024_23-46-40.jpg>
[2024-09-15T23:46:43] puneDir: Really cheap
[2024-09-15T23:48:04] 'lekrsu': Just get both packs to the same voltage before
[2024-09-15T23:49:11] puneDir: 2000 euro
[2024-09-15T23:49:16] puneDir: Even less
[2024-09-15T23:49:20] Noname: Speaking of I charged 17s full had giant diode connecting the rest 16s and it cut out a few times. No backfeed between batterys but did it not like vesc programmed 16s with 17s attached?
[2024-09-15T23:49:29] puneDir: 1600
[2024-09-15T23:49:30] haku: that looks like a grom
[2024-09-15T23:49:37] puneDir: Its bigger actually
[2024-09-15T23:50:11] Noname: Did this with 2 batterys before just waited till lower v and then connected the 16
[2024-09-15T23:50:52] puneDir: We dont have that
[2024-09-15T23:51:26] Noname: Well if you don't know the difference between honda and Chinese you never will. Ride what's available
[2024-09-15T23:51:49] puneDir: We dont have decent 125cc honda
[2024-09-15T23:51:59] puneDir: Only pcx and dio
[2024-09-15T23:52:14] Noname: Pcx then
[2024-09-15T23:52:29] Noname: I want one
[2024-09-15T23:52:39] puneDir: I dont want scooter style and pcx costs 3-4x of this (because of weird taxing)
[2024-09-15T23:52:49] Noname: Oh
[2024-09-15T23:52:56] puneDir: if this blows up i would make it electric or 300cc xD
[2024-09-15T23:53:16] Noname: They hold togeather just not quality feeling
[2024-09-15T23:53:23] puneDir: Yes
[2024-09-15T23:53:34] puneDir: This overall have better quality than other china 125s
[2024-09-15T23:53:43] puneDir: Builded in turkey i guess
[2024-09-15T23:58:09] puneDir: no its actually not that bad
[2024-09-15T23:58:22] puneDir: No vibrations, weird sounds

[2024-09-16T01:26:27] Noname: Well if you can't win you have to cheat.
[2024-09-16T01:32:43] haku: what!
[2024-09-16T01:34:24] haku: hes a boss like me. they cant kill him. we are the same people.
[2024-09-16T01:40:51] haku: no tax on tips and tax the pronouns. 10% for each pronoun used aside from the basic ones
[2024-09-16T01:46:36] GABE: ICE's are exactly 4x less efficient, yet the power density of oil is exactly 4 times more.
[2024-09-16T01:46:44] GABE: The range is the same, you see it with electric cars
[2024-09-16T01:47:00] GABE: I guess you can refuel on the road
[2024-09-16T01:47:49] GABE: Massive one lmao
[2024-09-16T01:48:06] GABE: 1000km road trip when
[2024-09-16T01:48:06] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-16T02:07:32] haku: death row to the baby killers and titty and dick choppers
[2024-09-16T02:44:02] haku: protect the dogs cats and geese
[2024-09-16T02:44:34] haku: close the dam border
[2024-09-16T02:44:42] Noname: I get 300mi to a tank and 3 min to refill or carry gas in the bed for cross continental voyage. @Bradhaku how long to charge 300mi 😆
[2024-09-16T02:46:06] haku: not much depends on the speed or when going on highways. but in city i charge everynight. i never deplete a car
[2024-09-16T02:46:30] Noname: For a full charge time
[2024-09-16T02:46:34] haku: when long trips maybe charge at 250 miles just to be safe
[2024-09-16T02:47:19] haku: on fast charger to 100% maybe an hour and 15mins. from 20% im usually good at 80% i dont top it off
[2024-09-16T02:47:54] Noname: That's not horrible I guess
[2024-09-16T02:48:23] haku: city driving its pretty good imo. its the long trips that i hate
[2024-09-16T02:49:14] haku: i also barely charge on a tesla fast charger. always at home
[2024-09-16T02:49:22] Noname: 100mi total
[2024-09-16T02:49:25] Noname: I did 55 miles on like 1/2 battery insane throttle controll. K6 is equil the bike needed 3 charge stops he's a bitch. The trash scooter also needed 3 also a range bitch
[2024-09-16T02:50:10] haku: all sitting down like bosses
[2024-09-16T02:50:35] haku: i like that patriot k6
[2024-09-16T02:50:38] Noname: I am not standing for 100mi
[2024-09-16T02:50:57] Noname: Did it on the vsett and it hurts my old bones
[2024-09-16T02:51:18] haku: that frankenstien k6 lol
[2024-09-16T02:51:24] Noname: But sweaty ass sucks It's hard to stand and dry off
[2024-09-16T02:51:36] Noname: K4 and a razor trike
[2024-09-16T02:51:56] Noname: He ripped the front end off one night
[2024-09-16T02:51:59] haku: its humid there. dry here. we dry wick here buddy. no sweat
[2024-09-16T02:52:05] haku: lol
[2024-09-16T02:52:43] Noname: Went for a nature walk and got sweaty
[2024-09-16T02:53:09] haku: dang thats god country.
[2024-09-16T02:53:13] haku: beautiful
[2024-09-16T02:53:44] haku: we dont get green like that here
[2024-09-16T02:54:15] Noname: <photos/photo_17628@16-09-2024_02-54-15.jpg>
[2024-09-16T02:54:49] GABE: need double the capacity on those cars to compensate for the charging times
[2024-09-16T02:55:02] haku: are there bears there? bring a pistol. scary stuff
[2024-09-16T02:55:03] GABE: Unless new cell tech surpasses the C rate by double.
[2024-09-16T02:55:13] GABE: 30 minutes is max I'd rip my hairs out at more
[2024-09-16T02:55:24] GABE: which it HAS
[2024-09-16T02:55:34] GABE: Just Ecars still use outdated cells, even Tesla.
[2024-09-16T02:55:48] GABE: Can't name that cell off the top of my head
[2024-09-16T02:55:49] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-16T02:56:37] haku: yes older teslas. bad quality 18650/21700. some model y after 22 came out with new cells
[2024-09-16T02:57:10] Noname: Western part of the state although there a fee around but it's not Montana no pistol needed here
[2024-09-16T02:57:39] haku: thats still apalachia right that part of your state?
[2024-09-16T02:58:37] haku: i always think i can survive in these woods. but i have no clue when shit goes down.
[2024-09-16T02:59:05] Noname: There's no banjo playing hicks but my blue dot is in the area
[2024-09-16T03:00:57] haku: no too bad quality still good enough for evs
[2024-09-16T03:00:58] GABE: Nowhere near Samsung 30T quality
[2024-09-16T03:01:03] GABE: bit less than
[2024-09-16T03:01:14] GABE: And Power output is equatable to M50LT
[2024-09-16T03:01:39] haku: i think they are partnered with panasonic back then
[2024-09-16T03:01:47] haku: im not sure
[2024-09-16T03:02:09] GABE: If Tesla used molicel and air cooled motors then it would be insane but noooooo
[2024-09-16T03:02:13] GABE: gotta keep production costs low
[2024-09-16T03:02:18] GABE: like the roadster better have that
[2024-09-16T03:02:25] GABE: or I'll be severely disappointed
[2024-09-16T03:02:44] haku: they dont make electric sports/race car. its a commuter car but still capable of racing some ricers
[2024-09-16T03:03:13] GABE: can't beat a 1000hp hellcat in a drag race cause acceleration just isn't the same.
[2024-09-16T03:03:30] GABE: 1.9s stripped Tesla 0-60
[2024-09-16T03:03:38] haku: yea. i dont think so. never tried though.
[2024-09-16T03:03:38] GABE: Model S
[2024-09-16T03:03:45] GABE: as in 0-100 in 1.9s
[2024-09-16T03:03:58] haku: i always drive in chill mode.
[2024-09-16T03:04:18] Jason: mmm
[2024-09-16T03:05:01] haku: im done with racing stuff. but i saw this earlier and reminded me of my youth as dominic torreto
[2024-09-16T03:05:32] haku: american version integra type r
[2024-09-16T03:05:58] haku: very clean and maintained too
[2024-09-16T03:07:25] haku: it would be cool to convert these small hondas into a ev.
[2024-09-16T03:11:16] Noname: But V-tec bro
[2024-09-16T03:11:36] haku: lmao. back in those days. it was the shit
[2024-09-16T03:12:20] haku: 10krpm for days.
[2024-09-16T03:12:39] Noname: Yr 25 of owning trucks, no going back
[2024-09-16T03:13:33] haku: only truck ive driven is ganmas truck. not a fan of the gas milage. i like the v8 sound though. it gurgles gas
[2024-09-16T03:14:30] Noname: Love it when going slow and punch it. Instant economy goes to 4mpg I've seen 3 if you really try
[2024-09-16T03:15:27] Noname: Not as bad as my buddy's 8L dually it gets 8mpg. Highway city or pulling a house it's 8mpg
[2024-09-16T03:15:59] haku: those things can tow
[2024-09-16T03:16:00] Noname: Man I wish gas was 99c again
[2024-09-16T03:16:38] haku: dont waste your vote on nonsense. remember how it was 4yrs ago
[2024-09-16T03:16:57] haku: maybe theres a chance
[2024-09-16T03:17:31] haku: protect the dogs cats geese and ducks.
[2024-09-16T03:18:24] haku: crap i still need to fix my vsett tire.
[2024-09-16T03:21:32] haku: dam flyer on my door to remind me again.
[2024-09-16T03:21:33] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-16T03:23:54] Jason: moments before my phone flew out
[2024-09-16T04:17:01] haku: looking at this photo dam 13" still smaller than small moped tires. maybe its just the angle
[2024-09-16T04:18:12] Noname: Well my rims are 12" vs 13" tire 😆
[2024-09-16T04:19:20] haku: that frankenstien k4 also has 13" on rear
[2024-09-16T04:19:58] Noname: 12
[2024-09-16T04:21:19] haku: that ones hilarious setup. i like it
[2024-09-16T04:33:11] Noname: He got hand me downs as a kid I think that's why he uses old parts
[2024-09-16T04:44:31] haku: woke in the back patriot in the front.
[2024-09-16T07:30:19] Yamal: ⚡️🕴⚡️

[2024-09-16T10:07:12] Yamal: WAter cooling?
[2024-09-16T10:07:22] Yamal: weped Korea !!!!!!!!!!
[2024-09-16T10:17:16] Adam Boyle: Hey guys, I have a Vsett 10+ (60 V) and reckon I'm ready to upgrade the controller. Worth noting that I've also added a second battery in parallel. I'm not really looking to go faster (mainly not looking to go 72 V yet because of the expense) but I really do want more acceleration. I've considered upgrading to the 11+ controller which has a higher output of 40-45 A (compared to the 30-35 A of the 10+), but I hear it doesn't make use of the hall sensors, and without knowing the impacts on efficiency, I understand it also makes the motors noisy. So then I'm thinking about a VESC controller, but am really not sure which would even be most applicable. The usual output between Ubox/Spintend/Flipsky seems to be 100 A a side but I know even the two batteries will not be up for this with the 60/70 A BMSs. The Flipsky seems to be the only one with 50 A output but it also mentions that the voltage may not exceed 60 V. What do you guys think would be the most applicable VESC controller for me?
[2024-09-16T10:45:01] 'lekrsu': Hey, you'll configure whatever current you want via VescTool.
[2024-09-16T11:21:52] Lisa: What about Stock Esc? What is better stock g30 esc or flispky 75200? @ESt1ft
[2024-09-16T11:34:12] Adam Boyle: Ohhh, well that makes sense, great to know! Is there a general consensus on which is better/more user friendly one between Ubox/Spintend?
[2024-09-16T11:35:02] 'lekrsu': You'll need to solder the cables, shouldn't be to hard to configure after that
[2024-09-16T11:36:54] Patrick: Why you ping me i only told you that youre stock esc will never even be close to deliver such a power like the 75200 lol
[2024-09-16T12:06:22] Adam Boyle: Sweet, alright thanks for the info James and Lekrsu, I'll do some research on vesc setup! And will probably avoid the 11+ controller haha
[2024-09-16T12:15:54] Lisa: You said you gonna send flispky feet pics for free flispky
[2024-09-16T12:15:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Liquid cooling yes and it old scooter
[2024-09-16T12:16:06] Lisa: (Joke) 🤣🤣😅

[2024-09-16T12:41:33] Adam Boyle: Here's one actually, can you expect to maintain most of the functions from before, such as original throttle/horn/indicators/gears etc?
[2024-09-16T12:54:10] Adam Boyle: Oh awesome. What do people normally do otherwise for displays/throttles? Or is Vsett a bit special in being incompatible out of the box? 🤣.
[2024-09-16T13:12:17] Adam Boyle: Great info, thanks mate. I'll try find further info myself now since I'm sure all these questions have been asked before 😁
[2024-09-16T13:29:48] GABE: Guy is ghosting me for a week cause of 10€, whatever I guess. I spent the 10€ so he never talks to me ever again.

[2024-09-16T13:44:26] Noname: Rip stock wiring out throw in garbage. New throttle get a voltage meter and GPS speedometer for bars. Not worth risking phone as display only for tuning. Don't worry about display keep your eyes on the road.
[2024-09-16T13:47:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Do you recommend flipsky 80a switch?

[2024-09-16T20:23:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: (75100 or reading wrong vules or not really changing settings depends which firmware I go with not to mention I'm stuck with only generic bootloader to download)

[2024-09-16T21:02:12] haku: @jamessoderstrom p42 6p on a old dual 100v2 is overkill yea. best would be like m50lt or some in high capacity cells
[2024-09-16T21:03:12] haku: very nice. how much?
[2024-09-16T21:03:50] Yamal: Well those 100/100 duals look good, but if they get hot it's a bummer
[2024-09-16T21:03:54] Yamal: No idea
[2024-09-16T21:04:24] Yamal: vesc tool for me is great, the only thing that uses up the cell phone battery, just that...
[2024-09-16T21:05:26] Yamal: but a powerful dual vesc would be nice..
[2024-09-16T21:05:55] haku: yea i will not make it a super fast one like some of these g30s. just good enough to go places, fit in the car without folding seats and take inside stores
[2024-09-16T21:06:48] haku: i will use minibike for going fast
[2024-09-16T21:07:30] haku: i want it all internal too like the jrev ninebot

[2024-09-16T21:23:04] Yamal: I think I could push 150A batter per controller, with my 20s10p
[2024-09-16T21:24:29] Yamal: 300A battery between the two, I don't know if the cells will gain heat quickly or just work well...
[2024-09-16T21:25:11] puneDir: How is the 50e
[2024-09-16T21:25:18] haku: just get a spintend 80/100 temporarily.
[2024-09-16T21:26:06] Yamal: No need for the moment,, just I wait November
[2024-09-16T21:26:36] Yamal: Get big spintend one for enjoy like bebe
[2024-09-16T21:28:13] Yamal: I really want try it,, with 150 battery/ 200/250 phase
[2024-09-16T21:28:42] Yamal: I really ride 100A battery and 200 phase and is so fun
[2024-09-16T21:29:18] haku: when i build my bike i really want to push the capability of this vesc.
[2024-09-16T21:29:34] Yamal: Like what?
[2024-09-16T21:29:46] Yamal: 200battery 300 phase ?
[2024-09-16T21:29:52] haku: hoe much battery amps and phase
[2024-09-16T21:30:19] Yamal: You can push the max phase with your new LUNG YU
[2024-09-16T21:30:38] Yamal: ALSO BATTERY
[2024-09-16T21:30:43] Yamal: with molicel
[2024-09-16T21:30:47] haku: i also want to see if you can turn 33x2 into torque motors
[2024-09-16T21:31:09] Yamal: Pretty nice ebike
[2024-09-16T21:32:30] Yamal: You need to know what is the maximum safe configuration for the spintends,, and after there, go up little by little until they explode
[2024-09-16T21:33:25] Paolo ⁭: No but you can turn torque motor to speed motor
[2024-09-16T21:33:50] Paolo ⁭: But yes, you can change the stator only
[2024-09-16T21:35:09] haku: how do you turn torque into speed? more voltage?
[2024-09-16T21:36:00] GABE: stator
[2024-09-16T21:36:08] GABE: With 22x3 sure
[2024-09-16T21:36:20] Yamal: Is like new motor
[2024-09-16T21:36:31] haku: ofcourse.i mean without changing windings
[2024-09-16T21:36:31] Yamal: Buy a pair 22/3
[2024-09-16T21:37:05] haku: 33x2 just need more amps to get torque
[2024-09-16T21:37:22] Yamal: For my 300/400A in 22/3 it doesn't make sense...
[2024-09-16T21:37:34] GABE: I'll have 540a
[2024-09-16T21:37:42] GABE: So 270a batt per motor
[2024-09-16T21:38:27] haku: i can actually fit a 10" qsmotor in the rear lol
[2024-09-16T21:38:35] haku: maybe front too
[2024-09-16T21:38:47] Yamal: But it’s a lot for 85/250 right
[2024-09-16T21:39:07] GABE: I think is that plenty for 22x3 70h?
[2024-09-16T21:39:17] GABE: As for 33x2 is 270a even enough
[2024-09-16T21:39:31] haku: idk tbh. its all theories until we build it
[2024-09-16T21:39:58] Yamal: 270batteryx2 no can..
[2024-09-16T21:40:28] Yamal: Even 3Shul push 400battery for the 2 controller..
[2024-09-16T21:40:34] haku: @jamessoderstrom how much battery amps is safe for 85/200 250
[2024-09-16T21:40:47] Yamal: Merlín
[2024-09-16T21:43:00] haku: if 250 not enough theres always the dark side. fardrivers
[2024-09-16T21:43:40] haku: so much room in my bike to fit those giant pos
[2024-09-16T21:44:56] haku: has anyone done that lonnyo motors on fardrivers
[2024-09-16T21:45:47] haku: i just dont want to be banished by lord james
[2024-09-16T21:45:52] Yamal: Vesc better …. But giant vesc = 💰=🍚
[2024-09-16T21:47:11] haku: i want my bike to be all from china theme. no maguras or western parts aside from battery
[2024-09-16T21:47:31] ElectricPowa: Cool cell. But low discharge. 48x Samsung are better now.
[2024-09-16T21:47:50] Yamal: sells the Tesla and gives way to the fluidity of 7
[2024-09-16T21:47:55] haku: 48x is a new cell? do you have datasheet
[2024-09-16T21:48:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So I'm afed ?
[2024-09-16T21:48:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Get 60100 instead?
[2024-09-16T21:48:55] ElectricPowa: My last scooter was at 380 amp battery total and the feeling is like a dragster 🤣🤣
[2024-09-16T21:49:24] puneDir: Whats the max discharge of 50e
[2024-09-16T21:49:26] puneDir: 20a?
[2024-09-16T21:49:28] haku: is it 70h? or bigger
[2024-09-16T21:49:38] Noname: This near me lol
[2024-09-16T21:49:40] haku: 25 i thibk
[2024-09-16T21:50:05] haku: i know whos selling that. from ny yea?
[2024-09-16T21:50:44] ElectricPowa: Not new.
[2024-09-16T21:50:45] ElectricPowa: https://www.batemo.com/products/batemo-cell-explorer/samsung-inr21700-48x/
[2024-09-16T21:51:03] Noname: Springfield MA
[2024-09-16T21:51:39] ElectricPowa: Nnooooooooo 😵‍💫😵‍💫😵‍💫 14. And for not too much time or go hot in a moment the cell. And you have a lot of drop voltage.
[2024-09-16T21:52:10] Yamal: Supposedly 48x is the replacement for the 50E that have already been discontinued?
[2024-09-16T21:53:15] ElectricPowa: Is possible. I find this cells like Nkon with point of soldering at good price. But this cells at 14 Amps don't go bad. Lot better respect 50e.
[2024-09-16T21:53:31] ElectricPowa: Best cells for me now are P45B and 50s
[2024-09-16T21:53:46] ElectricPowa: P45B are in the fastest car in the world 🤣😵‍💫😵‍💫
[2024-09-16T21:54:06] Yamal: 50s don't have much life they say.."
[2024-09-16T21:55:54] ElectricPowa: I have in my unycicle and they go really really good. And have 5000 km
[2024-09-16T21:56:06] ElectricPowa: I charge at 18 amps in one hour 🤣
[2024-09-16T22:00:03] GABE: MP2 at that stage
[2024-09-16T22:00:06] haku: i see. i was looking at the datasheet. seems less that the 50s
[2024-09-16T22:00:17] GABE: Less than 300e Vs 1000-2000
[2024-09-16T22:00:26] GABE: pay with your soul tho
[2024-09-16T22:00:29] haku: i doubt mp2 can handle that
[2024-09-16T22:00:44] GABE: the 18fet or w/e?
[2024-09-16T22:00:59] GABE: the biggest one of course.
[2024-09-16T22:01:07] Yamal: Also 50E?
[2024-09-16T22:01:16] GABE: I've been considering changing to 24s10p with MP2 and get the true power of those 22x3s
[2024-09-16T22:01:29] haku: 50e is a poverty capacity cell
[2024-09-16T22:01:57] GABE: Since I have no escs now, I have options.
[2024-09-16T22:02:09] GABE: Getting robbed opened new possibilities
[2024-09-16T22:02:24] GABE: And cell shape would be the same, the square prism.
[2024-09-16T22:02:54] Yamal: Where is the MP2..?
[2024-09-16T22:03:11] GABE: Wdym?
[2024-09-16T22:03:17] GABE: Where it'll be located?
[2024-09-16T22:04:17] Yamal: Vesc mp2 is something to craft...?
[2024-09-16T22:04:51] haku: yes. have to be a genius to build those
[2024-09-16T22:05:38] haku: you need sofisticated tools like chopsticks
[2024-09-16T22:05:50] Yamal: Could you put infineon Tolt in it?
[2024-09-16T22:08:33] haku: maybe. idk
[2024-09-16T22:10:31] sombre_enfant: Yo yo i have 4mp2 to sell if u want
[2024-09-16T22:10:41] sombre_enfant: I sell it price i bought
[2024-09-16T22:10:47] haku: do you make those
[2024-09-16T22:10:53] sombre_enfant: From the group order
[2024-09-16T22:10:59] sombre_enfant: No still in kit
[2024-09-16T22:12:55] Face de Pin Sucé: <video_file>
[2024-09-16T22:12:55] Face de Pin Sucé: Slack Core logic : Adjustables holes to adjust the height, but not really 😂😂
[2024-09-16T22:14:50] GABE: Are they the biggest ones.
[2024-09-16T22:14:54] GABE: What amps are they for anyways.
[2024-09-16T22:14:58] GABE: At 24s
[2024-09-16T22:15:02] GABE: or whatever
[2024-09-16T22:15:08] GABE: 30s maybe.
[2024-09-16T22:15:09] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-16T22:15:19] haku: what country is that made?
[2024-09-16T22:15:50] Face de Pin Sucé: South Korea
[2024-09-16T22:15:54] Face de Pin Sucé: But it's all shit
[2024-09-16T22:16:07] haku: crap chink quality eh
[2024-09-16T22:16:27] Face de Pin Sucé: Casted aluminum parts everywhere, titanium for nothing, shitty electronics, shitty motors (not lonnyo) ...
[2024-09-16T22:16:56] haku: how much do they charge for one of those. wow
[2024-09-16T22:17:11] sombre_enfant: They re 100v one stop trippin
[2024-09-16T22:17:43] sombre_enfant: 350 400if u swap resistor for brk
[2024-09-16T22:17:49] Yamal: Why are the engines bad?
[2024-09-16T22:18:11] Face de Pin Sucé: 8900€
[2024-09-16T22:18:25] Face de Pin Sucé: Smaller diameter than others 75H
[2024-09-16T22:18:47] Yamal: Not 75h?
[2024-09-16T22:19:06] Face de Pin Sucé: <video_file>
[2024-09-16T22:19:22] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes 😂 but not huameng motors x)
[2024-09-16T22:20:10] Face de Pin Sucé: <video_file>
[2024-09-16T22:20:50] Yamal: How long is the magnet ..?
[2024-09-16T22:21:19] Yamal: Also show the stator xD,, directo
[2024-09-16T22:21:20] Face de Pin Sucé: 75H
[2024-09-16T22:21:28] Face de Pin Sucé: No temp sensors
[2024-09-16T22:21:38] sombre_enfant: Stator diameter ?
[2024-09-16T22:21:41] Face de Pin Sucé: Everything is shit on this scooter
[2024-09-16T22:21:51] Yamal: The winding they said was not 33/2, something different.
[2024-09-16T22:21:59] Face de Pin Sucé: Huameng size x)
[2024-09-16T22:22:12] sombre_enfant: 105mm?
[2024-09-16T22:22:36] sombre_enfant: Instead of 110? Not much change maybe for the heat...
[2024-09-16T22:22:57] Yamal: Nice if you change the magnet
[2024-09-16T22:24:59] Face de Pin Sucé: It's a lot of changes
[2024-09-16T22:32:37] Ric.R.M: https://youtube.com/shorts/dDfxYXs5MvA?si=V24l0RsVIK14tboD

[2024-09-16T22:35:03] Yamal: Nice!
[2024-09-16T22:35:25] Yamal: What electronics did you use?
[2024-09-16T22:37:28] Ric.R.M: Spintend 150A
[2024-09-16T22:38:05] Yamal: 85/150?
[2024-09-16T22:38:09] haku: is that a hyperscooter @jamaludin_algarnati slack core?
[2024-09-16T22:38:17] Face de Pin Sucé: Everything is a waste in this scooter
[2024-09-16T22:38:25] Face de Pin Sucé: Titanium frame ma bite
[2024-09-16T22:39:04] Ric.R.M: yes
[2024-09-16T22:39:15] Yamal: 3?
[2024-09-16T22:39:26] Yamal: Yes? 😁
[2024-09-16T22:39:30] 'lekrsu': what's the manufacturer so I know what never to get
[2024-09-16T22:40:05] Ric.R.M: only in the rear
[2024-09-16T22:40:37] Face de Pin Sucé: Numo Slack Core
[2024-09-16T22:40:57] 'lekrsu': 7000€?!
[2024-09-16T22:41:15] Yamal: but you have two motors in front
[2024-09-16T22:41:43] Yamal: Can have cambus for 3 controller ..? XD
[2024-09-16T22:41:48] haku: are those 13" the rear rotation is bacwards
[2024-09-16T22:42:05] Ric.R.M: no in front it's empty.
[2024-09-16T22:43:15] Yamal: Better non-motorized tire if you don't use them? less weight and perhaps no resistance at all.
[2024-09-16T22:43:35] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: That's a soldering job of a man that claims he is a pro

[2024-09-16T22:45:51] Ric.R.M: because I'm still thinking about an upgrade to put 3.
[2024-09-16T22:47:54] Ric.R.M: with a maximum engine speed of 95 km/h
[2024-09-16T22:48:39] 'lekrsu': omfgg
[2024-09-16T22:49:52] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ha ah
[2024-09-16T22:50:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'll show my soldering job in a sec
[2024-09-16T22:54:22] haku: this is why i need a crimper for multiple cables. im not too confident on my skills
[2024-09-16T22:54:54] haku: like combining 3 cables to one
[2024-09-16T22:57:58] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What if don't have crimper?
[2024-09-16T22:58:12] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What could I use to makeshift one ?
[2024-09-16T22:58:14] Face de Pin Sucé: 8900€ in Europe
[2024-09-16T22:58:21] haku: you have to master the art of soldering
[2024-09-16T22:58:39] Face de Pin Sucé: Damn
[2024-09-16T22:58:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm trying (that above is not my job)
[2024-09-16T22:58:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yep haha
[2024-09-16T22:59:49] 'lekrsu': But honestly, how does one do it this badly? No flux and 300c? XD
[2024-09-16T23:00:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Drugs when work that's how
[2024-09-16T23:00:49] 'lekrsu': I hear the reasoning being "but it sticks"
[2024-09-16T23:01:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Isn't it connected ?
[2024-09-16T23:02:04] 'lekrsu': hahah the self react xD

[2024-09-16T23:29:31] GABE: @jamessoderstrom @PaoloWu
[2024-09-16T23:36:04] Pandalgns: Guys, a question, the spinted u boxes, of the 85v, the most powerful is the 250? or is there something more powerful??? Do you see it as a good option to mount two in my halo? with 2 3000w motors and 20s 10p molicel? Or for a similar price do you see a more powerful option, with BT and fuse it costs about 285 USD more or less 260 euros, what do you think?
[2024-09-16T23:37:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is this ok or shit like his ?
[2024-09-16T23:40:55] Andrei Albert: Updates
[2024-09-16T23:44:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is 10awg ok ? For 2 vescs ?

[2024-09-17T00:10:09] GABE: 300a phase? is that around the 80200?
[2024-09-17T00:10:32] GABE: The 80100 gives what phase usually?
[2024-09-17T00:10:58] GABE: Nah not drugs not even I'd do that on Adderall
[2024-09-17T00:12:00] GABE: 20s12p with a 4s12p external would be better, actually
[2024-09-17T00:12:22] GABE: Miles better and fit in a 1.5/2L, very clean.
[2024-09-17T00:12:23] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-17T00:15:06] haku: is it hard to quit adderal?
[2024-09-17T00:15:16] GABE: I never get dependent.
[2024-09-17T00:15:29] GABE: I was dependent on ritalin, and you would become very irritated when withdrawing
[2024-09-17T00:15:41] GABE: Stupid
[2024-09-17T00:15:47] haku: thats what they all say. its okay.
[2024-09-17T00:16:17] GABE: Id binge or so, 5 days a week on or take every 3 days. I haven't taken it in 2 weeks.
[2024-09-17T00:16:37] GABE: Id go a month without it sometimes.
[2024-09-17T00:16:48] GABE: Makes you into a fool when doing projects and you rush, makes issues. You'd do it unknownigly even if you try not to and are aware.
[2024-09-17T00:17:44] haku: i dont know what that feels but cocaine is a hulluva drug
[2024-09-17T00:18:14] GABE: It feels better than that. I'm glad they control my monthly dosage, in America I could just call and get another batch.
[2024-09-17T00:18:34] GABE: More room for addiction.
[2024-09-17T00:19:01] GABE: Less room for addiction when it's controlled and thankfully in Ireland meth does not exist on streets so I can't get a substitute
[2024-09-17T00:19:02] haku: sugar is worse
[2024-09-17T00:19:21] GABE: if I use my monthly amount early, it's okay. I'm forced to wait ages.
[2024-09-17T00:19:27] GABE: Theyre strict about it.
[2024-09-17T00:19:55] GABE: Probably kills more but mentally wise those stimulants are very bad for you
[2024-09-17T00:20:25] GABE: It's impossible to overdose on stimulants, it's like coffee where the overdose LD50 is like 10g or so Even if you take your monthly dosage at once, you'll be fine. Be prepared to feel like a pile of shit for a week, though
[2024-09-17T00:46:38] haku: i dont fuck around with those anymore but there a was a time coke when will make you drive to the gym and bench press until morning
[2024-09-17T00:48:19] GABE: Yeah it'll be this, perhaps I can fit a 2s12p internally at front as well, tha would be 22s12p internal G30.
[2024-09-17T00:48:41] GABE: And then I can add a 2s12p or whatever in a 1L if I really want to, or 4s12p if I get the MP2s
[2024-09-17T00:48:46] GABE: so many options here
[2024-09-17T00:48:52] haku: 22s 12p internal? how?
[2024-09-17T00:49:02] GABE: Because the shit at the front can't be used
[2024-09-17T00:49:09] GABE: unless you make everything taller
[2024-09-17T00:49:19] GABE: which the spacer will be like 60-70mm ISH
[2024-09-17T00:49:49] GABE: You can make a nice pack that would've been external and plop it in the front, it'll be very tall most likely. Semi circle prism pack with triple copper sandwich or so
[2024-09-17T00:50:12] haku: is this fantasia how you fit that in a g30
[2024-09-17T00:50:25] GABE: We will see But if you can't then 20s12p it is
[2024-09-17T00:50:31] GABE: and 4p12p external
[2024-09-17T00:50:40] GABE: 12p is guaranteed already the blueprints are there
[2024-09-17T00:51:00] haku: do you know how big 20s 12p is?
[2024-09-17T00:51:01] GABE: going an extra 1s at external isn't worth the 5% extra power methinks
[2024-09-17T00:51:05] GABE: Yes.
[2024-09-17T00:51:30] GABE: But I know it'll fit within the original parameters with a spacer.
[2024-09-17T00:51:49] GABE: You need a spacer for 20s6p so we assume the cells go above the metal bridges so stacking two is possible If by some means it isn't, we do 9/10p in a different shape and the 11" and v1s will compensate
[2024-09-17T00:52:39] haku: here 20s12p stacked next to a g30 frame.
[2024-09-17T00:53:02] GABE: Same p and S but different geometry
[2024-09-17T00:53:30] haku: you will scrape the ground
[2024-09-17T00:53:44] GABE: Your cell Is 8WIDE, the G30 frame does 6, so WE assuume the Pack will be 25% less tall
[2024-09-17T00:53:56] GABE: Keep in mind ESCS and BMS will be external, here :
[2024-09-17T00:54:07] GABE: <photos/photo_17670@17-09-2024_00-54-07.jpg>
[2024-09-17T00:54:22] GABE: more space behind there, that's an underexaggeration
[2024-09-17T00:54:23] haku: okay cant wait to see this badboy
[2024-09-17T00:54:45] GABE: <photos/photo_17671@17-09-2024_00-54-45.jpg>
[2024-09-17T00:54:55] GABE: those metal shits will be grinded
[2024-09-17T00:55:12] haku: <photos/photo_17672@17-09-2024_00-55-12.jpg>
[2024-09-17T00:55:19] GABE: <photos/photo_17673@17-09-2024_00-55-19.jpg>
[2024-09-17T00:55:39] GABE: It'll have as much ground clearance as a regular 6p G30 with 10".
[2024-09-17T00:55:40] GABE: Lol
[2024-09-17T00:55:48] Paolo ⁭: I don't know how safe is store so much batteries in your bedroom
[2024-09-17T00:55:48] GABE: which Is BAD
[2024-09-17T00:55:53] GABE: But whatever
[2024-09-17T00:55:58] GABE: If it's super fucking bad we go with 10p
[2024-09-17T00:56:18] haku: agreed. its not in use or charging though
[2024-09-17T00:56:27] GABE: id rather prefer the escs be there in the newfound space, instead of on the sides.
[2024-09-17T00:56:50] GABE: Cengiz showed me that newfound space on his 20s12p G30 MH1
[2024-09-17T00:57:05] haku: when it gets cold. i will bury it like treasure
[2024-09-17T00:57:09] GABE: Only becomes available with Rear suspension but my build will emulate that
[2024-09-17T00:57:29] Paolo ⁭: <sticker>
[2024-09-17T00:58:30] GABE: Con: when I get 12p I'll have to get a new square like BMS instead of a long ass BMS which I bought specifically for the 8p Pro 2 build I tore apart .
[2024-09-17T00:58:51] GABE: so there goes 100euro or so
[2024-09-17T00:59:14] GABE: I'm still thinking about 24s10p but weird ass geometry copper wise but same blueprints though
[2024-09-17T00:59:47] GABE: same cell count
[2024-09-17T01:00:07] haku: elon help you. the point of g30 is a light scooter. not as heavy as a laotie
[2024-09-17T01:00:34] GABE: 60kg min with 288 cells
[2024-09-17T01:00:38] GABE: And everything else
[2024-09-17T01:00:57] GABE: 133 pounds for you
[2024-09-17T01:01:10] haku: well great minds like wild shit. i like it
[2024-09-17T01:01:20] GABE: Death if you hit someone
[2024-09-17T01:01:38] GABE: Like a man flying at you at 60kmh
[2024-09-17T01:01:47] GABE: Headfirst
[2024-09-17T01:05:16] GABE: Unsure how many cellls could fit here at 14cm tall, probably, 2tall 2170 and around 12 on a floor (probably won't) so only 24.... So perhaps 2s12p external internal MAY be possible.
[2024-09-17T01:05:17] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-17T01:06:16] haku: you are the educated one. going to college for gender studies. you will figure this out and blow our minds
[2024-09-17T01:11:52] haku: i will save my magura for this g30. i will not be using it on minibike. the brakes on the mini bike is dot4/5 fluid
[2024-09-17T01:12:17] haku: i want i love china theme. all china all day
[2024-09-17T01:12:44] haku: no western parts allowed exept for battery
[2024-09-17T01:13:40] Noname: What crack you smokin?
[2024-09-17T01:13:55] Noname: Pulling trailer of batterys behind you?
[2024-09-17T01:14:10] haku: this is exactly my thoughts. i think he needs a shaman
[2024-09-17T01:14:53] Noname: That's 112 21700 cells
[2024-09-17T01:14:59] haku: if he pulls this off. dang big salute from me
[2024-09-17T01:16:18] Noname: Well it's either a 5L bag on front or a 3" spacer
[2024-09-17T01:16:49] haku: he smoking it thru a potato
[2024-09-17T01:17:49] haku: you grinded these rails yea?
[2024-09-17T01:20:53] Noname: Drilled but yeah
[2024-09-17T01:21:16] haku: fancy ass milled rails
[2024-09-17T01:21:42] Noname: Hillbilly milled
[2024-09-17T01:30:49] haku: not mine. he is the voice of reason. we have the same values.
[2024-09-17T01:37:19] Adam Boyle: Sounds like valid points, now that I'm searching around I'm seeing more about what is available. I suppose Ive come to a crossroads and can't find much info about the differences between the Dual Ubox V2 and the Lite. There are a few YT vids featuring the V2 but very little about the Lite. I like the Lite because all the wires come out one side, and because it's smaller (plus cheaper), but the Spintend website doesn't mention regenerative braking on the Lite while it does for the V2. I've also come across the MakerX Go-FOC D100S but that might be a bit more extreme than I need. Any advice on which of these I should be looking at? If applicable, I'd also like to be able to hook up lights and a horn but that seems fairly common between them.
[2024-09-17T01:44:27] Noname: Lite is new. Buy 2 singles if one dies you replace 1. Should be enough for a vsett 10 if not modding. Horn and lights need a dc/dc off the battery as they draw a lot of power.
[2024-09-17T01:46:36] ElectricPowa: Better modules squared of 6 cells.
[2024-09-17T01:47:35] Noname: Still can't fit 288 cells
[2024-09-17T01:48:14] Noname: And 6 wide doesn't fit
[2024-09-17T01:48:19] ElectricPowa: <photos/photo_17676@17-09-2024_01-48-19.jpg>
[2024-09-17T01:49:22] Noname: OK so you can fit 120 in the frame. Where are the other 168 batterys and controllers going?
[2024-09-17T02:01:26] Adam Boyle: Good thinking. The Lite does have regen. braking then I assume? I'd also thought I would include the ADC Adapter for the lights, indicators, horn etc
[2024-09-17T02:01:52] Noname: I'd assume it does
[2024-09-17T02:10:51] haku: i need this for me and my boy.
[2024-09-17T02:10:51] haku: <photos/photo_17678@17-09-2024_02-10-51.jpg>
[2024-09-17T02:20:23] Jason: potential scooter gore spotted
[2024-09-17T02:20:39] Jason: can we fit 120
[2024-09-17T02:28:12] Noname: I've heard yes but it's all the space
[2024-09-17T02:29:04] Noname: My buddy has a chinese one its actually bad ass Lil unit. That's looks nicer though
[2024-09-17T02:30:40] haku: i saw it in tractor supply. i think it china too
[2024-09-17T02:30:57] haku: wich one of these patches tubes?
[2024-09-17T02:31:29] haku: ill just get the universal one
[2024-09-17T02:32:05] haku: never patched a tube. vsett woke ass tubes
[2024-09-17T02:33:23] Noname: Old and new packaging
[2024-09-17T02:34:07] haku: gotcha. this will fix tubes you think. it says its for the actual tire
[2024-09-17T02:35:39] Noname: Yeah glue and rubber work on rubber
[2024-09-17T02:36:03] Noname: Buy some Ulip tubes damn you
[2024-09-17T02:36:38] haku: im done keeping buying tubes. thats what i had
[2024-09-17T02:36:46] haku: ill fix and sell this
[2024-09-17T02:41:49] haku: im gonna buy this too just incase covid happens again
[2024-09-17T02:54:38] haku: yea its china mini jeep
[2024-09-17T03:00:03] Rogerio Figueiredo: Dualtron tunder frame?
[2024-09-17T03:01:44] haku: soon. i will not fail you this time bud.
[2024-09-17T03:03:28] haku: lol
[2024-09-17T03:12:32] Noname: Don't make him take the 15mph cap off when shaman isn't looking
[2024-09-17T03:13:11] haku: do you guys put thread lock on the motor nuts?
[2024-09-17T03:13:41] Noname: Uga dugga and sent it
[2024-09-17T03:14:09] Noname: Idk there might be residue lol
[2024-09-17T03:14:29] haku: still waiting on huameng lock washer. its different from lonnyo
[2024-09-17T03:14:46] Noname: Don't need for test
[2024-09-17T03:15:06] Noname: That's just a loose nut safety
[2024-09-17T03:16:36] haku: i dont have the balls to ride this balls to the walls anyways. some 16 yr old surron kid will speed test for me. with a waiver ofcourse
[2024-09-17T03:17:30] Noname: Don't think I'd want to do 80 on that either
[2024-09-17T03:18:33] Noname: I'm good with like 50 on Lil wheels
[2024-09-17T03:19:12] haku: same
[2024-09-17T03:20:59] haku: i need to save up for this. ive been wanting milwaukee or makita powertools. not a good deal as last time
[2024-09-17T03:21:27] haku: no grinder on this one. wich is the one i really need
[2024-09-17T03:29:00] haku: dam i just got jipped. got this exact threaded rod in tractor supply for $5. in HD its $2
[2024-09-17T03:30:47] Noname: How tf do you complain about 3$ but spend 400 on drill set?
[2024-09-17T03:35:39] haku: i pride myself in getting the best deals bro. it really fucks with my head knowing someome got it cheaper than me 😭
[2024-09-17T03:37:43] haku: maybe its an asian heritage thing
[2024-09-17T03:37:56] haku: or poverty
[2024-09-17T03:47:12] Noname: 8$ for a med coffee and a coffee roll pisses me off
[2024-09-17T05:56:17] haku: i wonder if i grind these tack welds on the storage compartment seperating the battery compartment if it will weaken the structural integrity of this minibike. if i do that i can put a bigger battery or put 40t i have inside.
[2024-09-17T05:57:35] haku: <photos/photo_17684@17-09-2024_05-57-35.jpg>
[2024-09-17T05:57:45] haku: this are all the compartments
[2024-09-17T06:04:12] Noname: Not much strength there is it just a cover?
[2024-09-17T06:04:21] Noname: Idk what I'm looking at
[2024-09-17T06:22:44] haku: yea pretty much metal divider
[2024-09-17T06:23:18] Noname: Remove it the tacks say it's not important anyway
[2024-09-17T06:23:40] Noname: <animation>
[2024-09-17T06:24:03] haku: agreed. need to make measurements
[2024-09-17T06:24:22] haku: hope this works.
[2024-09-17T06:26:04] Noname: Did you scuff the ruber?
[2024-09-17T06:26:12] haku: yes
[2024-09-17T06:26:31] haku: i also have 2 gallons of this shit.
[2024-09-17T06:26:42] haku: i got it $5 bucks a gallon i think
[2024-09-17T06:26:45] Noname: It'll make a mess
[2024-09-17T06:26:55] haku: have you used it?
[2024-09-17T06:27:25] Noname: Different stuff in a 5 gallon bucket. Idk never cared for slinging goop
[2024-09-17T06:27:42] haku: ill just use it and see what happens
[2024-09-17T06:28:08] haku: if a bike tire uses 4 pumps this tiny scooter prolly uses 1 pump
[2024-09-17T06:58:04] Jason: I think it's good idea to do tig welds on outside
[2024-09-17T06:58:09] Jason: after grinding away those
[2024-09-17T06:58:14] Jason: or do it in and out and grind
[2024-09-17T07:35:32] Yamal: Do you have the motors with a 155 axle?
[2024-09-17T08:23:09] puneDir: <photos/photo_17687@17-09-2024_08-23-09.jpg>

[2024-09-17T08:43:09] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: This corrodes the wheel
[2024-09-17T09:53:17] GABE: Oh yeah, con, I'll have to grind rails on my G30 due to the tech being external now.
[2024-09-17T09:53:28] GABE: the plan was to avoid that
[2024-09-17T09:53:45] GABE: Annoying, pain and tears to another level
[2024-09-17T09:55:12] GABE: Then also have to weld a box for the escs and BMS to slide in And also probably find metal with fins so it gets cooling from top AND bottom, one esc on top one esc on bottom, BMS at back. so a cube, @Happy_Giraffe will help with that I believe. Front part of the cube wont have anything. As for MP2, I think it's too big, but we will see. Worst case scenario they will be on sides of the scooter, but pro there is unlimited cooling. Could also have escs on sides of the scooter to fit even even even more cells in the newfound space, perhaps a 4s12p internal external, or 2s12p, and 2s12p in the semi circle place upfront, so 24s12p/26s12p 'all internal" which is unthinkable, 312 cells then "all internal" and if I do find a way to get MP2s then I can add a 4s12p external if I want and get 30s12p (360 cells) with a 1.5L and still have foot space, if I'm lucky, 30s12p total with external, absolute maximum of MP2, 32s is meh because then I need a 3L and that is BAD, I've tried, it's dirty. no foot space = unstable and unsafe so let's avoid that. Motors will be capped anyways, at about 18kw each. Impossible to fit 80h until @CEPP group manufactures a real rear suspension, which I am eager to see what they come up with So much engineering needed to keep ground clearance safe

[2024-09-17T12:35:32] GABE: I need to get another 80 cells to make the 12p pack asap, or the cells will age unevenly for when I eventually get MP2's and new BMS, which is costly, (March in cashbook) It'll have 80100 now at 6P. So the 80 cells I need are top priority rn after the 700e finalization, otherwise I need to make the pack with fresh cells and fuck that. 100 charges is the most I want for the cells to not age too much, 144 if charged daily... which it won't, possibly 50 charges if the range is 50km (should be)
[2024-09-17T12:35:55] GABE: Meaning I have to make the back steel box ASAP after I finalize the 6P build.
[2024-09-17T15:18:19] crimeware: Guys I have a quick queation, what connector is on the ubox?
[2024-09-17T15:18:33] crimeware: JST 2.0?
[2024-09-17T15:31:44] luffydnoob: Where do I find this titane pole for dualtron victor??
[2024-09-17T16:03:49] crimeware: Thaannkkks
[2024-09-17T17:07:44] Happy Giraffe: So you decided I can magically do something for you without asking me first?😃
[2024-09-17T17:29:05] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: After checking I don't have to remove case I can just put them one above the other one on the deck (taped somehow) one on the floor of scoot
[2024-09-17T17:30:47] puneDir: Drill the frame
[2024-09-17T17:32:21] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So the will not move ?
[2024-09-17T17:32:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: There is no space for them to move
[2024-09-17T17:44:21] puneDir: Yes
[2024-09-17T17:44:25] puneDir: And better heat
[2024-09-17T17:45:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Bottom one bolt top one scotch tape so I can open deck without problems
[2024-09-17T17:55:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is your scooter ready for the rain ?
[2024-09-17T17:57:46] puneDir: Yes
[2024-09-17T17:58:10] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Nail polish on vesc ?
[2024-09-17T17:58:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What's about battery and connections ?
[2024-09-17T18:08:17] haku: he said you will weld him a titanium frame
[2024-09-17T18:15:14] GABE: I have a welder, I can do it myself, but it'll look dirty.
[2024-09-17T18:15:52] GABE: It won't be geometrically perfect if I make it. One can weld but can one weld.
[2024-09-17T18:17:58] Noname: All welders are gods but not all gods can weld
[2024-09-17T18:20:23] GABE: Me assuming you're still in the box business.
[2024-09-17T18:20:31] GABE: am I wrong?
[2024-09-17T18:20:34] haku: just wanted to share to you fellas that my son is in the top 1% in the nation when it comes to math compared to all other kids his age. hes only 5yrs old boooya baby
[2024-09-17T18:20:42] GABE: Lit.
[2024-09-17T18:20:59] haku: hes got that good tism boy

[2024-09-17T18:30:29] sombre_enfant: These chinese yns too op
[2024-09-17T18:34:02] GABE: Literally possible at this point with the newfound space, sure.
[2024-09-17T18:34:30] GABE: 26s possible with no external bag, I want to avoid one.
[2024-09-17T18:34:37] GABE: But if the voltage is so high at this point, why not?
[2024-09-17T18:35:16] GABE: If MP2s fit in the newfound space, or on sides, which they may not fit In either. Unsureyet, have to take Hella measurements, may not fit on sides, their parameters are massive. 20s escs otherwise will be limited to 20s only, so only the 20s12p allowed. and will stay at 20s forevermore, As im not spending 500-1000 a piece on some pile of crystallised glass (esc) that is beyond me.
[2024-09-17T18:36:13] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-17T18:39:25] haku: no rice for him if he cant solve math problems.
[2024-09-17T19:01:33] Happy Giraffe: It depends on the work and I have less time available now that Im working full time
[2024-09-17T19:04:32] haku: are you a machinist of you dont mind me asking?
[2024-09-17T19:04:58] haku: or only fans?

[2024-09-17T20:37:09] Happy Giraffe: I make part for boss, not myself😂
[2024-09-17T20:38:54] haku: how much do you think this will cost to cut a flat brushed steel or brushed aluminum or hardwood to replace this cheesy panel.
[2024-09-17T20:39:22] haku: maybe flat brushed stainless like cybertruck
[2024-09-17T20:41:03] haku: chinese have no sense of style. dam
[2024-09-17T20:46:02] haku: cyberminibike
[2024-09-17T20:46:04] Happy Giraffe: If you make a machine drawing then not much
[2024-09-17T20:46:18] Happy Giraffe: Laser cutting not expensive
[2024-09-17T20:46:32] haku: good to know. thanks
[2024-09-17T20:46:46] Happy Giraffe: And stainless sheet typically should be around 5$/kg
[2024-09-17T20:46:57] haku: nice!
[2024-09-17T20:47:18] haku: how do you get the brushed effect?
[2024-09-17T20:47:53] Happy Giraffe: Ofcourse depends if there are some shitty companies next to you. Maybe 30$ for material as they will fuck you and then 20$ for cutting perhaps if you provide them the file needed for laser cutter
[2024-09-17T20:48:24] Happy Giraffe: Not sure, brushing?🤣
[2024-09-17T20:49:04] haku: i want it bulletproof too. and heavy af
[2024-09-17T20:49:45] haku: no one can shoot my battery in the hood
[2024-09-17T20:50:01] haku: exept the external
[2024-09-17T20:53:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Why don't do it with connectors ?
[2024-09-17T20:54:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm genuinely asking because I also struggling a bit
[2024-09-17T20:55:36] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeEawh1P/
[2024-09-17T21:10:02] Izuna 生活: Pretty sure it can, just build it properly, but there is also another version MP2 DFN (I think it's called like that), which 100% can do.
[2024-09-17T21:10:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: ? Like I have this ec8 connectors and thinking about using connectorrs instead of wire to wire
[2024-09-17T21:10:40] Noname: Router with bearing cutter and just copy it
[2024-09-17T21:10:40] haku: i dont know anything about it. thanks for the info
[2024-09-17T21:11:54] haku: ill go to chinatown theres alot of fabricators there and ask for an estimate

[2024-09-17T21:29:51] haku: i see. ive always wanted to make one of those and see what the fuzz was all about
[2024-09-17T21:30:05] haku: its always mentioned but i never see them
[2024-09-17T21:33:30] haku: is the board top mounted parts or through hole
[2024-09-17T21:34:05] haku: like need heat gun and oven for it?
[2024-09-17T21:34:56] haku: gotcha. have you messed with these before?

[2024-09-17T22:39:01] haku: where exactly is this wires from?
[2024-09-17T22:40:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Battery to 2 vesc
[2024-09-17T22:41:18] haku: oh i see. ive never done a splitter before. but i would just solder 2 new wires from the battery to 2 vescs. idk wait for someone with more knowledge to answer this
[2024-09-17T22:43:05] haku: spitter from 1xt90 to 2 is what your saying yea?

[2024-09-18T00:55:39] haku: i think i will do that bolt it into a aluminum block and bolt and thermal paste to the frame
[2024-09-18T01:43:27] haku: looks pretty woke but. it should work.

[2024-09-18T03:46:39] Noname: Alum clogs unless you have specific alu grinding wheels
[2024-09-18T03:47:41] haku: so grinder with alu grinding wheel is best? if no mill?
[2024-09-18T03:47:50] Noname: Be easier with an oiled chisel and a hammer
[2024-09-18T03:48:33] Noname: Probably the worst possible way but if you got time
[2024-09-18T03:48:51] haku: ill do the hammer
[2024-09-18T03:49:26] haku: after i finish minibike. ill deal with that.

[2024-09-18T09:29:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: @jamessoderstrom mantis 10 motor reading do u know what the normal results should be ?(You or anyone here)
[2024-09-18T09:37:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_17708@18-09-2024_09-37-04.jpg>
[2024-09-18T09:37:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Mine didn't read the same results (but I do have the old mantis motor
[2024-09-18T09:53:57] NetworkDir: Looks fine
[2024-09-18T09:54:21] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Not my results
[2024-09-18T09:54:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's results from someones video and he is using newer mantis motor (I'll show mine in a sec)
[2024-09-18T09:54:58] NetworkDir: Should fine because punedir results similar with mine ubox on same 16x4 50H motors
[2024-09-18T09:55:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: (I'm also on 84100)

[2024-09-18T10:15:39] NetworkDir: Mantis motor sure ?
[2024-09-18T10:15:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes
[2024-09-18T10:16:16] NetworkDir: Still looks fine because i think mantis motors 45H and low kv so 55mohm fine
[2024-09-18T10:17:43] GABE: I'm gonna go see if the battery is there
[2024-09-18T10:17:46] GABE: hasn't rained.

[2024-09-18T10:38:36] GABE: suppose the space is there.
[2024-09-18T10:39:26] GABE: Like yeah I can put the stock but it's saggy as hell, I think Xiaomi ESC would be great with it.
[2024-09-18T10:43:38] 'lekrsu': smartesc v2 or something then?

[2024-09-18T20:30:30] sombre_enfant: U know if the shocks are lowered?i wanna put a rod on my front of my vsett maybe dampened with an "elastometre"
[2024-09-18T20:32:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: U got all of the wrong sizes
[2024-09-18T20:34:32] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: The same thing happened to me, that's why I have more 🤣🤣🤣
[2024-09-18T20:35:49] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: For racing it is better rigid
[2024-09-18T20:38:30] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes they are
[2024-09-18T20:38:45] Face de Pin Sucé: This is what we did in a way
[2024-09-18T20:41:10] haku: they made me find out the hardway. no one told me what the correct size was. only you did lol
[2024-09-18T20:41:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I know
[2024-09-18T20:44:49] Lisa: Lower the khz?
[2024-09-18T20:47:28] NetworkDir: Can make noise but not enough
[2024-09-18T20:47:42] NetworkDir: Bldc mode also have a robotic sound I don't like it
[2024-09-18T20:47:54] Lisa: That’s the reason I like Stock Esc from Xiaomi and ninebot with many Volts
[2024-09-18T20:48:02] Lisa: Yea too high
[2024-09-18T20:48:37] NetworkDir: Maybe something on vesc values available for change sound with power algo or etc
[2024-09-18T20:48:52] NetworkDir: And this why i ask here maybe anyone knows
[2024-09-18T20:49:03] Lisa: If you find a way tell me!
[2024-09-18T20:49:05] haku: speaking of nami. where is our boy @jamaludin_algarnati. i hope the woke did not get to him. i already told him to join my side for protection
[2024-09-18T20:51:21] sombre_enfant: Wich plastic u used ? Im in plastic industry in cnc now i dont know one of them that have spring propriety
[2024-09-18T20:54:36] Face de Pin Sucé: PU
[2024-09-18T21:09:59] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: that will be brought in hand
[2024-09-18T21:11:23] NetworkDir: I thinking about play music when riding but looks dangerous maybe burn something

[2024-09-18T21:41:47] sombre_enfant: Wich kind might u dont mind giving me dia and lenght aprox for 75kg pilot + around 40kg scoot ?
[2024-09-18T21:42:05] Pandalgns: Guys, in these u box taking them to 20s and the maximum amperes would a heatsink be advisable??? and where should it be placed? I mean, which area needs to be dissipated/cooled more in these controllers?
[2024-09-18T21:42:43] sombre_enfant: I know french when i see one
[2024-09-18T21:43:10] sombre_enfant: On the back all the surface
[2024-09-18T21:44:18] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't remember
[2024-09-18T21:44:42] Pandalgns: From the bottom part that can be seen in the photo? I wanted to put that part attached to the chassis of the scooter since it has the plates to screw it there
[2024-09-18T21:44:56] sombre_enfant: U put it in between a rod acting as a shocks right ? I ll ask my boss he might know
[2024-09-18T21:47:44] Jan: No, dont sink (store) the heat, get it away from the scooter (Place it where you have airflow). 300A phase and 150A is alright for it, can do more than that
[2024-09-18T21:49:09] haku: how much have you pushed these?
[2024-09-18T21:50:07] haku: 150a battery can it do more?
[2024-09-18T21:50:49] Pandalgns: but I'm not going to put it inside, it's going to go outside, under the scooter and I'm starting to design a support with a cooling tunnel, that's why I was asking about the heatsinks
[2024-09-18T21:51:23] Jan: We pushed 150A per controller, thats it, im sure it could do more
[2024-09-18T21:51:43] Pandalgns: U have this u box?
[2024-09-18T21:51:45] Jan: You can also put it inside attached to a wall
[2024-09-18T21:51:54] Jan: two for G30
[2024-09-18T21:52:02] Pandalgns: Inside all battery
[2024-09-18T21:52:07] Jan: Yes
[2024-09-18T21:52:25] Pandalgns: I put 2 in my halo t107 pro
[2024-09-18T21:52:41] Pandalgns: With 20s10p molicel battery and 3000w motors
[2024-09-18T21:52:50] Pandalgns: 60h22x3
[2024-09-18T21:52:56] haku: all internal?
[2024-09-18T21:52:57] Jan: 2x 85250 Spintend + 20S6P P42a => 20kW 136kmh
[2024-09-18T21:53:02] Jan: All internal
[2024-09-18T21:53:28] Pandalgns: Im inside only put a battery
[2024-09-18T21:53:36] Pandalgns: Cant put more inside
[2024-09-18T21:53:38] Pandalgns: 😂😂
[2024-09-18T21:54:02] Jan: How does it look inside?
[2024-09-18T21:54:09] haku: true i tried that with the laotie. 20s10p takes the whole space unless theres spacer
[2024-09-18T21:56:28] haku: Me im on the fence where to mount it. maybe on a aluminum block then to bolyed to the walls
[2024-09-18T21:56:50] Jan: I need to make a flow chart: Is your internal space full? - No => Put more stuff into it - Yes => Can you put a coin into it and still be able to close it? — No => Its actually full — Yes => You have not used the space to its potential
[2024-09-18T21:57:23] Jan: If you dont need half an hour to close the lid, its not full ^^
[2024-09-18T21:58:30] haku: dang like inside a laptop or cellphone. everything tight
[2024-09-18T22:01:30] haku: so much room on mine i can fit 2 big fardrivers internal. but not doing that.
[2024-09-18T22:03:01] haku: that disc brake bracket you have in the rear. you made that?
[2024-09-18T22:03:15] Jan: Yes
[2024-09-18T22:03:33] Jan: Old stuff, would do my own bracket design now
[2024-09-18T22:03:36] haku: you have a mill?
[2024-09-18T22:03:40] Jan: No
[2024-09-18T22:04:36] Jan: Manual labour with some workshop tools like anglegrinder and band grinding machine
[2024-09-18T22:05:32] Jan: <photos/photo_17742@18-09-2024_22-05-32.jpg>
[2024-09-18T22:06:09] Jan: This is my design, if i ever do one again i will order a cnc of this
[2024-09-18T22:06:28] haku: way better
[2024-09-18T22:07:01] Jan: Got already copied
[2024-09-18T22:07:20] haku: i dont want to copy your design but this g30 big inspiration to build one
[2024-09-18T22:07:28] haku: very very nice
[2024-09-18T22:07:36] Jan: Got copied Rear fender Speedfork Rear brake adapter More is on the way 👏
[2024-09-18T22:08:26] Jan: Tbh if it inspires people than thats great, its just a shame when no one else comes up with ideas and just profits on ideas of others
[2024-09-18T22:08:52] Jan: A world like this doesnr go anywhere
[2024-09-18T22:10:25] haku: i agree with this.
[2024-09-18T22:11:15] haku: hopefully you made some money with your design before giving it away
[2024-09-18T22:12:22] Jan: No
[2024-09-18T22:12:24] haku: with my minibike i dont think im copying anyone.im the only fool that will try that frame
[2024-09-18T22:12:33] Jan: Not even covered the expenses cost
[2024-09-18T22:16:06] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Workie pokie

[2024-09-18T22:27:35] crimeware: I have G30 V5
[2024-09-18T22:28:25] crimeware: The Y Connector is for Charging using the original Charging Port on the G30.
[2024-09-18T22:30:40] Tristan: Based on the design, and reworked.
[2024-09-18T22:31:03] Tristan: Many improvements
[2024-09-18T22:31:16] Jan: Hopefully we see some great new designs of your group as well 😉

[2024-09-18T23:25:45] Pandalgns: Guys
[2024-09-18T23:28:49] Pandalgns: Wait a bit for the video
[2024-09-18T23:29:53] Pandalgns: I just quickly designed a first sketch of what I was telling you before to see what you think, the blue would be the controllers, the gray on top of the controllers custom heatsinks, the red and pink that goes on top would be the same piece and it would be The casing that seals everything against the chassis and makes it watertight, there are some holes and steps missing for the cables and to screw it to the chassis, but what do you think?
[2024-09-18T23:29:53] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_17744@18-09-2024_23-29-53.jpg>

[2024-09-18T23:32:32] Pandalgns: <video_file>
[2024-09-18T23:33:18] Pandalgns: turn it around.... the cooling tunnel would go at the bottom of the scooter
[2024-09-18T23:34:37] haku: i see
[2024-09-18T23:35:18] haku: never seen that on a scooter deck before. cool
[2024-09-18T23:40:56] Pandalgns: With bigger entrance, probably better
[2024-09-18T23:42:16] haku: Noname is this better quality than harbor freight brand?
[2024-09-18T23:48:59] Noname: I don't have HF wrenches but they're sockets and screwdrivers are good. Prob good enough your not working on rusty cars
[2024-09-18T23:51:24] haku: 30 bucks for these might be a good deal
[2024-09-18T23:51:34] haku: hf has similar prices
[2024-09-18T23:55:27] haku: how about this deal?
[2024-09-18T23:55:38] haku: its the old brushed model
[2024-09-18T23:56:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not bad
[2024-09-18T23:56:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not sure
[2024-09-18T23:56:35] Noname: Brushed drills just get hot if you torture them.
[2024-09-18T23:56:45] haku: gotcha.
[2024-09-18T23:57:10] Noname: Put batterys in bits and blades spin
[2024-09-18T23:57:18] Noname: It's cheap price
[2024-09-18T23:58:46] haku: i checked it doesnt come with a cordless grinder.
[2024-09-18T23:58:54] haku: i thought it did
[2024-09-18T23:59:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Even pics doesnt have one🤷‍♂

[2024-09-19T01:06:14] haku: how about our bms. can china just decide to explode that?
[2024-09-19T01:08:18] Mirono escooters: Man, if someone wants, sure
[2024-09-19T01:08:46] Mirono escooters: If you connected to BMS and they have access to your app and change max voltage over limits and disbalance it...
[2024-09-19T01:08:51] haku: damn thats a scary thought
[2024-09-19T01:09:02] Mirono escooters: It's not like a big Red button is there for them to just make it go boom

[2024-09-19T07:30:39] puneDir: You connected can and battery after?
[2024-09-19T07:38:22] Lisa: Maybe they have the same vesc ID? And they don’t show

[2024-09-19T08:23:56] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: if cam doesn't work for me configure the controller separately then put the throttle on one detect it do the same with the other make a bridge to accelerate but only use + on one throttle

[2024-09-19T17:47:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Thinking about mounting it standing up on the deck like the 2 battery hole will be laying down

[2024-09-19T18:06:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Stem ok
[2024-09-19T18:07:24] Yamal: Tail?
[2024-09-19T18:09:13] GABE: Say the G30 monorim, is everything the same on it as the M365 version, except the long tube that goes through the stem?
[2024-09-19T18:09:24] GABE: Spending 125 on something I don't need is so stupid
[2024-09-19T18:09:46] GABE: Are the bearing arms also the same length? The fork I obviously don't care about fyi.

[2024-09-19T19:44:54] GABE: Is the 12fet MP2 just as strong as the 80/250 12 fet spintend? I hear the 18fet 30s version can only do lower amps due to the nature of the FETs
[2024-09-19T19:44:58] GABE: @kawaiinekololis
[2024-09-19T19:45:55] Yamal: Are you still deciding electronics👍

[2024-09-19T19:50:54] haku: not at all. just trolling
[2024-09-19T19:51:09] haku: i can barely speak american
[2024-09-19T19:51:28] Yamal: I expected more than playing the ukulele
[2024-09-19T19:52:04] haku: we like small things baby. it enhances our size
[2024-09-19T19:52:18] haku: by size you know what i mean
[2024-09-19T19:53:40] Yamal: Hawaii must have a lot of wasa

[2024-09-19T19:55:40] sombre_enfant: Maybe put a titanium stunt scooter bar at this point
[2024-09-19T19:58:08] Yamal: You have to take James on that trip, so he can mess with the g30 chasing the police xD
[2024-09-19T20:00:13] Noname: Yeah it needs a clamp guide though you'll drift like a mofo. Or a table saw better. Spray a lil aluminum tapping fluid on blade to not clog it.
[2024-09-19T20:00:30] Noname: Bit dangerous but doable
[2024-09-19T20:03:14] haku: ill find a neighbor with a tablesaw

[2024-09-19T20:14:20] Rose: Hey there Christophe, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-09-19T20:14:21] haku: normally folks clamp it to the stem
[2024-09-19T20:14:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: One bump and scooter goes boom

[2024-09-19T20:37:57] haku: those tits are incredible though
[2024-09-19T20:52:42] GABE: 1. Are there only 100v and 150v FETs and nothing in-between for the 18fet MP2? 2. Just to clarify, 30s FETs have LESS amp power capability? FreehandZ Jason
[2024-09-19T20:54:26] GABE: So, 100v FETs can only do 20s (84v/100v headroom).
[2024-09-19T20:55:00] GABE: and 30s 150v respectfully, but say you use 24s on the 150v's, then would the amps still be limited because of MOSFET infrastructure?
[2024-09-19T20:59:46] Yamal: Is that a man or a woman?
[2024-09-19T20:59:53] Yamal: ^^'
[2024-09-19T21:00:02] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-09-19T21:00:07] haku: its a hyperscooter
[2024-09-19T21:00:23] Yamal: Hehe
[2024-09-19T21:00:42] Yamal: hyper boris
[2024-09-19T21:01:49] haku: these people are teaching kids schools here.
[2024-09-19T21:02:10] Yamal: Same here
[2024-09-19T21:02:34] Yamal: I guess someone has slipped in
[2024-09-19T21:06:26] haku: elon will cure these people
[2024-09-19T21:07:52] Yamal: Elon is very involved in his world and entangled with his schedule protocols, do you really think he is going to do something?
[2024-09-19T21:08:02] Yamal: NaaaaaAaaAaaaahhhhh🥲
[2024-09-19T21:08:15] Yamal: Make money yesss
[2024-09-19T21:08:21] haku: yes. he is for the future of humanity.
[2024-09-19T21:09:39] Yamal: The truth is that I don't trust Elon one bit either,, the people with great fortunes can be dangerous
[2024-09-19T21:09:47] Yamal: My opinion ..
[2024-09-19T21:10:35] haku: elon is more than just a billionare. he really cares about whats going on. if he didnt he wouldnt bother with twitter and just follow the money
[2024-09-19T21:11:23] haku: he endorsed the former president even though he doesmt like electric cars
[2024-09-19T21:12:05] haku: he also has the balls to say anything. free speech.
[2024-09-19T21:21:15] Yamal: The amperes issue can be observed in the specifications of the same controller with different voltage capacities.
[2024-09-19T21:21:39] Yamal: Can see in 3Shul, x12,seven..
[2024-09-19T21:26:09] Yamal: But ,, I don’t know confuse with this 3
[2024-09-19T21:28:27] Yamal: I need to send 5 photos of the specifications of these 3 models in the different voltages
[2024-09-19T21:31:30] Yamal: <photos/photo_17782@19-09-2024_21-31-30.jpg>
[2024-09-19T21:31:30] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-19T21:36:33] GABE: Who has the schematics for G30 with 6p; The height of the spacer with a given esc height.
[2024-09-19T21:36:55] Yamal: <photos/photo_17783@19-09-2024_21-36-55.jpg>

[2024-09-19T21:37:00] GABE: Need to know what to tell James to print in advance.
[2024-09-19T21:37:04] GABE: so he puts it in packet
[2024-09-19T21:40:53] Yamal: I don’t know seven 18 / 24s and 32s look the same
[2024-09-19T21:41:28] Yamal: <photos/photo_17785@19-09-2024_21-41-28.jpg>
[2024-09-19T21:41:28] Yamal: <photos/photo_17786@19-09-2024_21-41-28.jpg>
[2024-09-19T21:41:28] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-19T21:44:41] haku: you cant tell james what to do. he tells you what to do son.
[2024-09-19T21:44:55] GABE: Hes looking forward to it
[2024-09-19T21:45:49] haku: you will really build this mp2. it will take more time that just getting one built
[2024-09-19T21:46:06] GABE: STM is on it
[2024-09-19T21:46:09] haku: but you a gangsta so lets see it
[2024-09-19T21:46:17] GABE: only issue i had.
[2024-09-19T21:46:19] GABE: Now solved
[2024-09-19T21:46:28] GABE: not gonna get into heat gun shit.
[2024-09-19T21:46:50] haku: how much does a kit cost the biggest one?
[2024-09-19T21:47:01] GABE: i found a guy who sells it for same as JCB order price
[2024-09-19T21:47:16] GABE: 77 each, all parts included and STM soldered by JCB
[2024-09-19T21:47:18] haku: already pre built?
[2024-09-19T21:47:27] GABE: Just have to solder fets and like 2 resistors
[2024-09-19T21:47:36] haku: oh thats not too bad
[2024-09-19T21:47:37] GABE: easy stuff
[2024-09-19T21:47:38] GABE: yes
[2024-09-19T21:47:40] GABE: 150e
[2024-09-19T21:47:45] GABE: when i wouldve spent 540
[2024-09-19T21:47:49] GABE: almost 4x less
[2024-09-19T21:47:49] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-19T21:48:22] haku: so whats the setup now? 30s 15p?
[2024-09-19T21:50:55] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Can someone help ??
[2024-09-19T21:51:04] GABE: Undecided, 12p all forms though.
[2024-09-19T21:51:08] GABE: 20/22/24, want the brick to be 20s, so can do what i want later, add 2s or 4s int ext.
[2024-09-19T21:51:25] GABE: same clearance as 6p g30s (bad), clearance at 6p for now will be fire. peace of mind.
[2024-09-19T21:52:16] Yamal: https://youtu.be/LeBiXBic3sE?si=Tj9DhIIFYgGn1CdF
[2024-09-19T21:53:21] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Fixed it
[2024-09-19T21:53:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But now can bus always disconnect when switch on traction control
[2024-09-19T22:10:15] haku: is it okay for my phase cables to be like this or does it have to loop around like the other ones?
[2024-09-19T22:11:28] sombre_enfant: Well i would do the jan spacer it should fit easy with mp2 a 20s6p with ant 575A or jbd 600A
[2024-09-19T22:12:24] GABE: Perfect, what height is it?, 230a PK 575A Is the ANT I have. it's 2cm. @AJAJ1992
[2024-09-19T22:14:01] sombre_enfant: 30mm but u need to do the plate on jlcpcb metal side
[2024-09-19T22:14:25] sombre_enfant: For around 80€ or less u set
[2024-09-19T22:16:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: For testing
[2024-09-19T22:16:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_17788@19-09-2024_22-16-56.jpg>
[2024-09-19T22:17:26] GABE: I got access to one
[2024-09-19T22:18:36] GABE: Rails Cut or not? I could put BMS and escs up top
[2024-09-19T22:24:23] haku: i was wondering that. phase cables looped like that can catch on something and break.
[2024-09-19T22:24:43] haku: dog can also chew it easier
[2024-09-19T22:31:18] Andrei Albert: <photos/photo_17789@19-09-2024_22-31-18.jpg>
[2024-09-19T22:32:54] Yamal: Nice proyect
[2024-09-19T22:33:21] Yamal: He have 22/3 or 33/2? Can’t remember or maybe never say in the video ..
[2024-09-19T22:33:31] Andrei Albert: 22/3
[2024-09-19T22:33:51] Andrei Albert: 120 i reached with it
[2024-09-19T22:34:12] Andrei Albert: But dangerous on his setup
[2024-09-19T22:34:28] Andrei Albert: A lot of wobble
[2024-09-19T22:34:34] Yamal: A Battery A Phase ?
[2024-09-19T22:35:02] Andrei Albert: 200A batt 280 phase
[2024-09-19T22:35:09] Andrei Albert: And 70 fw i think
[2024-09-19T22:35:34] Yamal: Can make lower
[2024-09-19T22:35:55] Yamal: 35+35?
[2024-09-19T22:42:36] Yamal: How do you plan to combat wobbles in your project?
[2024-09-19T22:43:53] Yamal: <voice_message>
[2024-09-19T22:46:55] Pandalgns: 😂😂 yamal vibes 💪😜
[2024-09-19T22:52:42] Yamal: positive vibes so we don't get shit splashed
[2024-09-19T22:55:29] Yamal: Benjamin x amnesia haze
[2024-09-19T23:04:08] FreehandZ: Higher voltages usually have lower current ratings iirc. Mp2 uses to220 fets, and there are only a handful of specced voltages e.g. you won't have a 127v rated mosfet
[2024-09-19T23:07:09] haku: when they come to your hood you will splash that shit.
[2024-09-19T23:08:28] FreehandZ: Top?
[2024-09-19T23:08:48] FreehandZ: I think that's the one he has
[2024-09-19T23:10:41] Yamal: I don't live in a neighborhood, I live in the middle of the countryside xD
[2024-09-19T23:11:12] Yamal: But I have wifi xd
[2024-09-19T23:11:33] GABE: mp2s and bms inbetween rails
[2024-09-19T23:11:39] FreehandZ: Rails need to be cut for 20s6p 21700
[2024-09-19T23:11:52] GABE: Not with my setup
[2024-09-19T23:11:59] GABE: id rather leave them for now.
[2024-09-19T23:12:11] FreehandZ: Oh long extender?
[2024-09-19T23:12:20] GABE: 11'' tyres will compensate
[2024-09-19T23:12:20] FreehandZ: Mp2 likely might not fit
[2024-09-19T23:12:34] GABE: inbetween rails?
[2024-09-19T23:12:36] FreehandZ: It's 100mm, and space in between rails are 98 - just over 100mm
[2024-09-19T23:12:41] GABE: thats fine, i can put them on bottom anyways
[2024-09-19T23:12:59] FreehandZ: <photos/photo_17790@19-09-2024_23-12-59.jpg>
[2024-09-19T23:13:04] FreehandZ: This is how the jrev scoot is
[2024-09-19T23:13:52] GABE: So the rails are how many mm tall?
[2024-09-19T23:14:07] FreehandZ: I actually didn't measure that I think
[2024-09-19T23:14:12] FreehandZ: I can check later today
[2024-09-19T23:15:56] GABE: Any specced voltage for around 22-24s? not 30s fets, that will lower amp capability, or is it just 100v and 150v.
[2024-09-19T23:16:03] GABE: with to220 specifically
[2024-09-19T23:18:49] Jan: 6mm
[2024-09-19T23:19:36] GABE: so i need a 36mm extender.
[2024-09-19T23:19:40] GABE: heard yours was 30mm
[2024-09-19T23:19:50] GABE: OK perf.
[2024-09-19T23:20:02] Jan: You also need to grind the whole opening 1mm
[2024-09-19T23:20:09] GABE: thought so anyways.
[2024-09-19T23:20:15] Jan: Else you cant put the bat in
[2024-09-19T23:20:25] GABE: may have to grind even more
[2024-09-19T23:20:27] GABE: For my setup
[2024-09-19T23:20:29] GABE: annoying
[2024-09-19T23:20:48] Jan: The easiest is to cnc it all in one go
[2024-09-19T23:20:49] GABE: at the front or else cant place on batt on top of the other
[2024-09-19T23:20:53] GABE: Lol
[2024-09-19T23:20:55] GABE: 1000e
[2024-09-19T23:21:00] Jan: Rails out, opening too
[2024-09-19T23:21:09] GABE: All doable
[2024-09-19T23:30:39] FreehandZ: I have an angle grinder, a grinding disc, and myself
[2024-09-19T23:30:53] FreehandZ: Gonna straight grind the rails haha
[2024-09-19T23:32:50] FreehandZ: There are 120v MOSFETs etc
[2024-09-19T23:32:53] Yamal: https://youtu.be/5GYIEihLTZw?si=Esij2TXhyRkOMaMv
[2024-09-19T23:32:56] FreehandZ: But not as common I think
[2024-09-19T23:33:05] Yamal: Hood 😂
[2024-09-19T23:33:07] FreehandZ: Use the parametric search
[2024-09-19T23:33:19] FreehandZ: On mouser, digikey or lcsc or something similar
[2024-09-19T23:37:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: A bit of my music taste (and some dual 84100 when not open full )
[2024-09-19T23:37:52] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Thank you to god 🙏
[2024-09-19T23:40:19] Yamal: One controller ?
[2024-09-19T23:41:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Dual but half performance
[2024-09-19T23:43:44] GABE: Same voltage headroom as 100v fets at 20s. 16%.
[2024-09-19T23:43:50] GABE: This would be so good.
[2024-09-19T23:44:15] FreehandZ: I have found 100v 308a 1.8mohm rdson to220 mosfets lmao
[2024-09-19T23:44:19] FreehandZ: legs melt
[2024-09-19T23:44:28] Face de Pin Sucé: Numo... Rage Mechanics...
[2024-09-19T23:44:32] NetworkDir: Lmfao
[2024-09-19T23:44:39] GABE: why?
[2024-09-19T23:44:42] FreehandZ: I used them in my g30 esc
[2024-09-19T23:44:49] FreehandZ: not thick enough?
[2024-09-19T23:44:54] FreehandZ: package limit?
[2024-09-19T23:45:01] GABE: It's a g30 esc
[2024-09-19T23:45:12] FreehandZ: I know I got them for the low rdson
[2024-09-19T23:45:32] FreehandZ: my front esc did have 2 mosfets short (one phase), I used different mosfets
[2024-09-19T23:45:35] FreehandZ: much higher rdson
[2024-09-19T23:45:54] FreehandZ: so I guess its good?
[2024-09-19T23:46:39] FreehandZ: hey Jason https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/MOSFETs_HUASHUO-HSP0076A_C2903573.html
[2024-09-19T23:46:40] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. FreehandZ has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-19T23:47:13] Yamal: Do you fit the controllers with their box?
[2024-09-19T23:49:44] Jason: that's the current best with the spec but 308A to220? kinda sus 🤨
[2024-09-19T23:50:11] Yamal: By the way, as you have seen its stability and geometry on the circuit
[2024-09-19T23:50:13] Jason: on my g30 I use crst030n10n
[2024-09-19T23:50:17] Jason: 100v 180a
[2024-09-19T23:50:43] FreehandZ: Yes sus but you should test them on your mp2
[2024-09-19T23:51:02] Jason: I don't have boards to assemble aaaa
[2024-09-19T23:51:08] GABE: 125a each, 120v, 24s safe?
[2024-09-19T23:51:14] Face de Pin Sucé: No, we make a complete custom case and battery to fit everything inside
[2024-09-19T23:51:18] Jason: only working one I have is already assembled with crst073n15n
[2024-09-19T23:51:22] GABE: 125x3p, 375a batt?
[2024-09-19T23:51:28] GABE: Or am I wrong
[2024-09-19T23:51:37] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, it's stable, but it's handlebar is way too high, I can't judge the driveability of this
[2024-09-19T23:52:05] GABE: what is rdson
[2024-09-19T23:52:22] Jason: Resistance Drain-Source ON
[2024-09-19T23:52:37] FreehandZ: My friend got some mp2 boards, I'll tell him to try them
[2024-09-19T23:52:44] Jason: (7am thought)
[2024-09-19T23:52:53] Jason: try 400a phase
[2024-09-19T23:52:54] GABE: So how do I know if the fet has it
[2024-09-19T23:52:56] Jason: lol
[2024-09-19T23:53:12] FreehandZ: Realistically your usable current is probably more like <200a max
[2024-09-19T23:53:15] FreehandZ: I think
[2024-09-19T23:53:23] FreehandZ: All fets have an rdson spec
[2024-09-19T23:53:37] GABE: But it wont fuck shit up, the higher volt fets.
[2024-09-19T23:53:42] GABE: Right
[2024-09-19T23:53:44] GABE: so it's fine
[2024-09-19T23:53:59] GABE: Yeah the 70hs will be saturated at about 300a phase anyways each
[2024-09-19T23:56:13] Yamal: Rage Mechanic is in the kitchen?
[2024-09-19T23:56:30] FreehandZ: <photos/photo_17793@19-09-2024_23-56-30.jpg>
[2024-09-19T23:56:40] FreehandZ: 3x 150a rated fets as an example
[2024-09-19T23:57:33] GABE: Wow AC formulas becoming useful finally
[2024-09-19T23:57:53] GABE: single phase complex current mm
[2024-09-19T23:58:02] GABE: CRMS
[2024-09-19T23:58:04] FreehandZ: You'd want higher rated mosfets
[2024-09-19T23:58:13] GABE: Then they will heat apparently
[2024-09-19T23:58:34] FreehandZ: Wdym?
[2024-09-19T23:58:49] GABE: you mean amperage wise?
[2024-09-19T23:58:54] FreehandZ: Yes
[2024-09-19T23:58:58] GABE: I didn't see anything better than 125a 120v
[2024-09-19T23:58:59] GABE: right
[2024-09-19T23:59:19] GABE: and they must be low rdson which I dont know what value is acceptable
[2024-09-19T23:59:20] FreehandZ: Or, the shitty solution (that may not even work), moar fets
[2024-09-19T23:59:34] GABE: 18fet is max on mp2 anyways.
[2024-09-19T23:59:42] FreehandZ: On the current mp2
[2024-09-20T00:00:04] FreehandZ: Jlcpcb charges more extravagantly for pcbs larger than 100mm in any direction
[2024-09-20T00:00:14] GABE: f that lol.
[2024-09-20T00:00:19] FreehandZ: So, separate power stage?
[2024-09-20T00:00:22] GABE: I already got two sorted for 150.
[2024-09-20T00:00:25] FreehandZ: So much to do
[2024-09-20T00:49:11] haku: what do you mean by this.
[2024-09-20T00:55:40] FreehandZ: I'm guessing grind around the top lip? There's a lip at the top. 119mm, opens a couple mm past the lip
[2024-09-20T00:56:20] GABE: <photos/photo_17794@20-09-2024_00-56-20.jpg>
[2024-09-20T00:56:30] GABE: is this it?
[2024-09-20T00:56:47] FreehandZ: There's a lip yea
[2024-09-20T00:57:47] FreehandZ: <photos/photo_17795@20-09-2024_00-57-47.jpg>
[2024-09-20T00:57:59] haku: i see what your talking about. thanks
[2024-09-20T00:58:07] GABE: <photos/photo_17796@20-09-2024_00-58-07.jpg>
[2024-09-20T00:58:11] GABE: moreso like this no
[2024-09-20T00:58:34] GABE: I get it tho
[2024-09-20T00:59:07] FreehandZ: No? I don't think so
[2024-09-20T00:59:50] haku: 20s 6p will not fit unless you grind those lip?
[2024-09-20T01:00:04] FreehandZ: It's pretty much a perfect fit
[2024-09-20T01:00:28] FreehandZ: Nothing else fits, wire routing was a problem for Jan iirc
[2024-09-20T01:15:11] GABE: Have to grind a lil to do that
[2024-09-20T01:15:26] GABE: but yeah
[2024-09-20T01:15:48] GABE: As in the lip
[2024-09-20T01:16:04] GABE: .
[2024-09-20T01:16:14] GABE: Nah
[2024-09-20T01:16:29] GABE: if someone else done it it's possible anyways
[2024-09-20T01:16:40] GABE: And I know someone has
[2024-09-20T01:17:11] GABE: Oh also when 12p comes those will have to go 100%
[2024-09-20T01:17:37] GABE: <photos/photo_17797@20-09-2024_01-17-37.jpg>
[2024-09-20T01:17:43] GABE: Yes.
[2024-09-20T01:18:50] GABE: If not, it'll be this.
[2024-09-20T01:18:59] GABE: Same clearance as 6p g30
[2024-09-20T01:19:23] GABE: Compensation with frame.
[2024-09-20T01:20:22] GABE: Next cooling solution will have to be either on sides of frame, or the box at back with fins on top and bottom, escs respectfully. Box cleaner
[2024-09-20T01:21:35] GABE: The motors will be so capped bro
[2024-09-20T01:21:35] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-20T06:07:31] Yamal: Friday!!!!!
[2024-09-20T06:13:46] haku: found my headlights
[2024-09-20T06:17:11] Yamal: https://youtu.be/CtosjYj96Rs?feature=shared
[2024-09-20T06:17:58] Yamal: Pretty beast⚡️🔥
[2024-09-20T06:19:08] haku: we gonna brushed stainless steel the whole sides
[2024-09-20T06:22:03] haku: is that mexico spain or france?
[2024-09-20T06:22:20] Yamal: Spain , Valencia
[2024-09-20T06:23:20] haku: they have racing in spain too? why dont you join dude
[2024-09-20T06:28:59] Yamal: There is no scooter, no money and when the championship started the family was there and things become more difficult, it is a combination or accumulation of many things...
[2024-09-20T06:32:07] haku: when i see you race someday. ill fly there amd watch. ill be on my batman costume. just dont be embarassed im there cheering for you okay
[2024-09-20T06:33:19] haku: batman costume and a raising a giant face cutout of BV
[2024-09-20T06:34:24] Yamal: I really don't know what will happen in 2025, whether I will continue in Spain or not...
[2024-09-20T06:35:20] haku: wherever you end up bud. im sure there will be scooters there
[2024-09-20T07:18:58] Yamal: So you're not going to put the 20s 10p?
[2024-09-20T07:20:01] Yamal: You could give life to the minibike very soon with the 40t
[2024-09-20T07:43:56] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/QXty0gPwdBE?si=XKrC2YcGPjKk7l29
[2024-09-20T07:44:43] Yamal: I'm going to start giving life to the channel! without means, without cameras for the moment, but something will happen I say!
[2024-09-20T07:44:47] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-09-20T07:44:47] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-09-20T08:33:52] Mirono escooters: Wayoo
[2024-09-20T08:34:12] Mirono escooters: Valve through tire is funny 😂
[2024-09-20T08:42:54] Yamal: Do you think there is really a notable difference between 70h and 75h, both 33/2,,?
[2024-09-20T08:49:15] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2024-09-20T08:56:26] Yamal: Another thing we observed is that 90% of the races are on kart circuits, small circuits, where you can't really take the scooter to its extreme, 140/150kmh, referring to the speed engines.
[2024-09-20T08:58:04] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes because fast circuits are no fun to watch
[2024-09-20T08:58:36] Face de Pin Sucé: In the meantime we reached 134Kmh at Alès, while others didn't exceed 129Kmh
[2024-09-20T09:01:49] Yamal: Of course, any circuit that has the possibility of going over 120..22/3 would not work,,,,, but I think that these motors will do a good job on most small circuits
[2024-09-20T09:12:10] Face de Pin Sucé: We did over 120 on all circuitd
[2024-09-20T10:45:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 120?? What is your setup?
[2024-09-20T11:13:04] Yamal: Battery ~20s10p Samsung 40t Esc ~Little Focer v3.1 Motor ~60h 22/3 One controller die in August
[2024-09-20T11:16:27] Jan: <photos/photo_17803@20-09-2024_11-16-27.jpg>
[2024-09-20T11:16:32] Jan: Looked like this?
[2024-09-20T11:18:12] Oreo huzky: Looks crispy
[2024-09-20T11:22:55] Yamal: Wauh 😂
[2024-09-20T11:24:21] Yamal: Barbecue
[2024-09-20T11:24:56] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: TRONIC ?
[2024-09-20T11:25:28] Andrei Albert: Yea
[2024-09-20T11:26:21] Jan: Funny how the mosfet just cease to exist
[2024-09-20T11:34:52] Jason: xd
[2024-09-20T11:35:10] Jason: I like hvdc arcs
[2024-09-20T11:35:17] Jason: never forgives, 0 mercy
[2024-09-20T11:46:26] Rose: Hey there Kanax, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-09-20T11:46:35] GABE: Should run on F1 tracks
[2024-09-20T11:46:39] GABE: true potential then
[2024-09-20T11:46:51] GABE: if only tho amirite
[2024-09-20T11:47:21] haku: las vegas F1 track.
[2024-09-20T11:48:16] Jan: ESC on top is not so ideal as there is a silicone mat on top. Side works good, bottom works good
[2024-09-20T11:49:16] haku: <photos/photo_17805@20-09-2024_11-49-16.jpg>
[2024-09-20T11:57:36] puneDir: No tank slapper?
[2024-09-20T12:03:41] Face de Pin Sucé: We too slow for F1 track
[2024-09-20T12:05:23] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No have strong dumper
[2024-09-20T12:22:47] Patrick: How to make the ubox lite big again
[2024-09-20T12:23:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: This is not ubox
[2024-09-20T12:23:21] Patrick: Oh makerbase lol
[2024-09-20T12:23:41] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: TRONIC is kk I set it on fire it's the best
[2024-09-20T12:23:46] GABE: 200 kmh really?
[2024-09-20T12:23:46] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: TRONIC 250 R
[2024-09-20T12:25:10] GABE: Yeah, it'll be on bottom then.
[2024-09-20T12:25:32] Andrei Albert: Mines are running fine on a x2 up
[2024-09-20T12:34:16] Face de Pin Sucé: Nobody is going 200Kmh
[2024-09-20T12:36:59] Jan: Ask someone in your area to cnc the frame properly
[2024-09-20T12:37:20] Jan: Else you spend hours on it and also the result will be unsatisfying
[2024-09-20T12:37:49] Jan: Unless you wanna go for a guiness world record, its useless
[2024-09-20T12:38:07] 'lekrsu': My grinded rails are nice and smooth, but the time it takes is insane.
[2024-09-20T12:51:02] Face de Pin Sucé: I wouldn't say that, going 200kmh on track would be nice, considering how easy it is to drive 160+Kmh
[2024-09-20T13:01:08] Jan: On a gokart track? Our tracks in switzerland are too small for that
[2024-09-20T13:06:52] GABE: I've seen it
[2024-09-20T13:07:12] GABE: In chats.
[2024-09-20T13:07:48] GABE: what if you use a micro angle grinder
[2024-09-20T13:08:08] Face de Pin Sucé: No
[2024-09-20T13:08:11] Face de Pin Sucé: Never happened
[2024-09-20T13:08:24] Face de Pin Sucé: No, on a motorcycle track
[2024-09-20T13:08:38] GABE: Not gonna say who it was anyways.
[2024-09-20T13:08:50] GABE: Why so
[2024-09-20T13:09:00] Face de Pin Sucé: No matter who, never happened
[2024-09-20T13:09:09] GABE: physically impossible?
[2024-09-20T13:09:15] Face de Pin Sucé: It's possible
[2024-09-20T13:09:28] Face de Pin Sucé: But, it requires a real development
[2024-09-20T13:09:42] GABE: 33x2 is a must though I assume
[2024-09-20T13:09:55] Face de Pin Sucé: At 200kmh frame that we know will enter in resonance
[2024-09-20T13:10:05] Face de Pin Sucé: I think @AJAJ1992 understands what I mean
[2024-09-20T13:10:44] Face de Pin Sucé: And your driver will act as a sail and your scooter will become undrivable
[2024-09-20T13:10:58] Face de Pin Sucé: And also, the power needed is huge
[2024-09-20T13:11:22] GABE: Ah, so it's aerodynamically capped.
[2024-09-20T13:11:25] Face de Pin Sucé: Has anyone here seen someone push more than 40KW (or even 40KW) on 11inch scooter ?
[2024-09-20T13:12:09] GABE: don't think so
[2024-09-20T13:12:50] GABE: 40kw that's like 100h needed ye?
[2024-09-20T13:13:00] GABE: or 120h?
[2024-09-20T13:13:19] GABE: double 60h
[2024-09-20T13:14:42] GABE: How does Zuna go 120kmh with 9p P42A
[2024-09-20T13:14:55] GABE: smaller motors, more heat, higher speed
[2024-09-20T13:14:56] GABE: ?
[2024-09-20T13:15:57] Face de Pin Sucé: ;)
[2024-09-20T13:16:00] GABE: at 20s. Yeah I know it's fwk but we talk total amps here, he only pushes 10kw a motor or so
[2024-09-20T13:16:36] Face de Pin Sucé: It depends of motor kv, voltage and power
[2024-09-20T13:16:55] GABE: Smaller hall motors = more kv i think?
[2024-09-20T13:17:09] Face de Pin Sucé: I'm not surprised he goes 120Kmh, we used to do 147Kmh with 70H and 20S8P 40T
[2024-09-20T13:17:21] GABE: That's crazy
[2024-09-20T13:17:54] Face de Pin Sucé: Not really, it's only 25KW to achieve that type of speed
[2024-09-20T13:19:03] Jan: You will need aero to make it feasable
[2024-09-20T13:19:11] Face de Pin Sucé: Exactly
[2024-09-20T13:19:32] Jan: You cant bring 70kW down on the 11inch
[2024-09-20T13:19:37] Jan: And on aero you dont need
[2024-09-20T13:20:11] Face de Pin Sucé: Oh yes you can, at higher speeds
[2024-09-20T13:32:36] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It would be nice to do the races on 3km circuits twice as big as karting circuits. In karting you don't reach much speed but you can see the skill of the driver on the straights. Everyone is very brave.
[2024-09-20T13:33:48] Face de Pin Sucé: It's not really interesting, we did race on Carole motorcycle track circuit, really no fun to watch, only the fastest scooter is in front, and others are behind
[2024-09-20T13:33:54] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: The Guadix circuit in Granada “Spain” would be ideal
[2024-09-20T13:34:42] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: That's what I mean, on the straights we all accelerate to 100%.
[2024-09-20T13:35:31] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I stopped running in Jerez a long time ago
[2024-09-20T13:36:22] Face de Pin Sucé: https://youtu.be/FIRvMWQFl6A?si=o5g3CGAQFpkNkZVl
[2024-09-20T13:36:33] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes but really no fun racing on this type of tracks
[2024-09-20T13:36:50] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: if this video is very popular 🤣
[2024-09-20T13:37:02] Face de Pin Sucé: Really cool to be able to push on straights, but racing, boring x)
[2024-09-20T13:37:54] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Guadix
[2024-09-20T13:38:31] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuito_Guadix
[2024-09-20T13:42:53] GABE: @SibClimb
[2024-09-20T13:43:24] Face de Pin Sucé: This would be amazing for our racing scooter x) much top speed
[2024-09-20T13:54:14] puneDir: What is time out controller?
[2024-09-20T13:59:01] FreehandZ: Dremel + grinding disc
[2024-09-20T14:02:31] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: True but this circuit is not too big
[2024-09-20T14:11:37] GABE: Not worse than spending 12h on a Xiaomi esc which blows first try anyways
[2024-09-20T14:11:40] GABE: im used to it.
[2024-09-20T14:11:50] GABE: that's why i don't care how much time building an mp2 would take
[2024-09-20T14:11:56] GABE: or 24. 2 full days work
[2024-09-20T14:19:46] Face de Pin Sucé: Vesc fault code, driver kept pushing throttle instead of waiting the fault to reset, so it lasted longer than it should have
[2024-09-20T14:27:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Now is the time to start thinking about waterproofing your scooters
[2024-09-20T14:58:42] Face de Pin Sucé: They are
[2024-09-20T14:58:51] Face de Pin Sucé: We did 2 races under rain at Alès
[2024-09-20T15:00:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yours do not mine 😞

[2024-09-20T15:09:39] Yamal: How is posible you don’t have place,,?
[2024-09-20T15:09:59] Yamal: Your battery is 20s?
[2024-09-20T15:11:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No but still no space
[2024-09-20T15:11:21] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: (will put in a box on stem)
[2024-09-20T15:11:53] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: As u can see no space
[2024-09-20T15:12:09] GABE: did you bend the phase solder angle
[2024-09-20T15:13:43] Jan: Didnt you have grip issues after 40kW?
[2024-09-20T15:13:53] Yamal: If I remember correctly, Punedir had one in the hole below and the other top screwed to the deck,,
[2024-09-20T15:14:09] Jan: You can but it will take time
[2024-09-20T15:16:27] Yamal: But he get 40kw…? Show come on 😂
[2024-09-20T15:19:40] Face de Pin Sucé: We lost rear grip under rain once yes, but then driver arranged his position and didn't lose again the grip
[2024-09-20T15:25:27] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I know I'll try that maybe
[2024-09-20T17:31:24] haku: can spintend adc adapter support 2 powerfull 12v headlights? one regular and one fog lights?
[2024-09-20T17:31:55] haku: how many amps 12v rail
[2024-09-20T17:31:56] GABE: 13s is too unstable on Xiaomi esc, Im building a 12s6p pack right now, all internal, should be ready today even
[2024-09-20T17:32:55] GABE: Actually, these fets should synchronize with 13s, the other esc was 100v FETs, bad .
[2024-09-20T17:38:59] GABE: Using G30 battery as base.
[2024-09-20T17:40:15] Finn: Why not go higher in voltage?
[2024-09-20T17:45:17] GABE: Because I only need it for the city.
[2024-09-20T17:45:29] GABE: xesc modding, waste of time.
[2024-09-20T17:45:36] GABE: It's a daily.
[2024-09-20T17:45:36] Finn: More Voltage is more efficient
[2024-09-20T17:45:58] Finn: Running my daily 72V g30 for almost 2k km at max phase + 10A fw
[2024-09-20T17:46:12] 'lekrsu': Max phase?
[2024-09-20T17:46:16] Finn: 75A
[2024-09-20T17:46:23] GABE: Don't need it, massive cell and 250w motor.
[2024-09-20T17:46:23] Finn: Sorry Max Xiaodash Amps
[2024-09-20T17:46:32] 'lekrsu': Alright, yeah. Can't go much higher.
[2024-09-20T17:46:49] Finn: Motor resistance is whats limiting the current
[2024-09-20T17:47:00] GABE: Good
[2024-09-20T17:47:01] Finn: doesnt make any difference to go higher
[2024-09-20T17:47:04] 'lekrsu': Above that would just be burn territory for no reason.
[2024-09-20T17:47:18] Finn: PADH holds impressively long
[2024-09-20T17:47:35] 'lekrsu': Ran 65A phase on 35A battery current on a Gen 1 for a couple weeks. Ran well. However it got too hot when it was slightly sub 30C ambient in direct soaring sun.
[2024-09-20T17:48:12] GABE: I'm using zero FWK
[2024-09-20T17:48:22] 'lekrsu': I dont use FWK either.
[2024-09-20T17:48:22] Finn: Weirdly my motor also gets very hot and doesnt burn
[2024-09-20T17:48:50] 'lekrsu': Alright, technically my G2 on stock firmware does push 10A fwk for no reason. Rofl.
[2024-09-20T17:48:56] Finn: v4 has thicker wires
[2024-09-20T17:49:20] 'lekrsu': I've seen a v4 almost burn
[2024-09-20T17:49:33] GABE: 45kmh.
[2024-09-20T17:49:41] GABE: 50kmh with, fuck all. not worth extra amps
[2024-09-20T17:49:52] Finn: Also cant draw more then 35A continious
[2024-09-20T17:49:58] Finn: maybe good that its like this
[2024-09-20T17:50:20] GABE: Put 30% extra amps for 5% more speed
[2024-09-20T17:50:25] GABE: go figure
[2024-09-20T17:50:52] 'lekrsu': <video_file>
[2024-09-20T17:50:59] 'lekrsu': What an overheated Gen 4 sounds like
[2024-09-20T17:51:38] 'lekrsu': That was after Manux ran 35A max throttle in 35C weather for 30km.
[2024-09-20T17:51:49] 'lekrsu': That's what happens when neither the ESC nor the motor has temp sensors!
[2024-09-20T17:52:00] Finn: mine makes rubber noises when its hot xD
[2024-09-20T17:52:09] 'lekrsu': Yeah, the rubber seal will do that xD
[2024-09-20T17:52:24] Finn: Then i know i have to let it cool down before smth happens
[2024-09-20T17:52:28] Finn: coils look brand new
[2024-09-20T17:56:34] sombre_enfant: New shfw is very good with bigger motor more phase amps
[2024-09-20T18:03:25] GABE: damn, that 2s balance lead I threw out 2 years ago, I need it.
[2024-09-20T18:03:35] GABE: I knew I should've kept it
[2024-09-20T18:09:24] Mir Aman Bahner: I had PAAH and it lasted with 48v and max xdfw beta field weakening, until I decided to give my friend a ride, uphill on a hot summer day. It didn't burn but something broke in the motor ):
[2024-09-20T18:09:36] Noname: It's like 3a so I wouldnt
[2024-09-20T18:13:36] haku: lame. i want to blind people like gandalf riding down the orcs in lord of the rings 2
[2024-09-20T18:14:14] Noname: No Idea what that is but use a step down and a switch
[2024-09-20T18:21:52] haku: if you havent watched it 20yrs ago ill give you a breakdown and the moral of the story. the evil orcs= woke idiots. they are bad and you have to get rid of them by being good. run em down like the animals that they are.
[2024-09-20T18:23:02] haku: thats the authors perspective
[2024-09-20T18:23:20] Noname: My life is complete now, thanks
[2024-09-20T21:09:25] haku: how much do fabricators usually charge to weld a metal box like this?
[2024-09-20T21:13:25] Yamal: that looks like a block of flats brother
[2024-09-20T21:14:02] Yamal: you need to draw the windows
[2024-09-20T21:29:46] Noname: Fab shop tig welded? Prob 300$
[2024-09-20T21:32:58] haku: heck no. i shouldve just bought the china og box for $90
[2024-09-20T21:34:50] haku: how about to cut a small aluminum block? how much do those usually cost?
[2024-09-20T21:48:33] Noname: Like that bits and cut offs shop prob just cut it if you buy something
[2024-09-20T21:51:51] haku: ill get it from that metal shop
[2024-09-20T22:01:55] GABE: Gonna have to drive my shit with solids again
[2024-09-20T22:01:57] GABE: lol
[2024-09-20T22:02:38] GABE: At least itll be all internal
[2024-09-20T22:02:52] haku: banned
[2024-09-20T22:03:34] GABE: the 20% extra power will be nice
[2024-09-20T22:03:41] haku: ive thought about it though. on the vsett lol
[2024-09-20T22:03:52] GABE: 40kmh on demand with like 2A FWK
[2024-09-20T22:04:04] GABE: almost none
[2024-09-20T22:04:19] GABE: safe asf and with 12s it'll be gucci
[2024-09-20T22:04:48] GABE: outrun the kugoos with A 12s mijia
[2024-09-20T22:05:05] haku: solids with no suspension on offroad is horrible.
[2024-09-20T22:05:18] GABE: I'll get solids in like 10 days
[2024-09-20T22:05:21] GABE: I mean real tyres
[2024-09-20T22:05:34] GABE: just gotta buy a 10x2 tyre and a 2x 10x2 tubs
[2024-09-20T22:05:38] GABE: nothing speed up to 45kmh then. bigger tyres always = more speed same KV Motor wasn't burned, I assumed it was, stopped locking when I changed xesc
[2024-09-20T22:25:54] GABE: baby 4x4
[2024-09-20T22:25:54] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-20T22:28:27] haku: how many time have you rewelded this battery?
[2024-09-20T22:30:38] Yamal: https://youtu.be/Yep_H0GZ8sY?si=eHIF3KjM5tsJQQDt
[2024-09-20T22:30:45] Yamal: My cousin,,
[2024-09-20T22:31:26] haku: are you really indian?
[2024-09-20T22:33:10] haku: lol a warranty card.
[2024-09-20T22:39:48] Yamal: Pretty nice
[2024-09-20T22:39:57] Yamal: No but I like the food
[2024-09-20T22:40:08] Yamal: Indian breakfast is spectacular
[2024-09-20T22:40:25] Yamal: I don’t know many food
[2024-09-20T22:41:00] haku: i not a fan of curry unless its thai curry.
[2024-09-20T22:48:06] haku: i also rather have china quality than indian quality. with all due respect.
[2024-09-20T22:50:08] Yamal: indian girls,controller, food = 3Shul
[2024-09-20T22:51:41] haku: nah. chinese girls better imo. they will wash your feet
[2024-09-20T22:52:51] Yamal: Noooooooo
[2024-09-20T22:52:55] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-09-20T22:53:03] haku: 😂
[2024-09-20T22:53:15] Yamal: haku you break with any scheme
[2024-09-20T22:54:08] Yamal: You should buy a hat and cowboy boots
[2024-09-20T22:54:42] Yamal: You will become famous on the streets of Las Vegas with the minibike
[2024-09-20T22:57:24] haku: i will be cancelled real quick.
[2024-09-20T23:21:09] haku: dang we need this. https://youtube.com/shorts/PLelWrHHWcg?si=uRPBI-KSjphF2OL0
[2024-09-21T01:12:29] GABE: Once.
[2024-09-21T01:13:00] GABE: Will be rewelded a second time into 13s7p all int but I have no copper, drop a P to have it all internal.
[2024-09-21T01:13:35] GABE: this 2s8p will be internal with the 10s6p g30 battery so We looking at 670wh at 6p
[2024-09-21T01:14:25] GABE: I have no solder at the moment so I can't even solder battery connectors.
[2024-09-21T01:15:07] haku: i thought youd be doong p42
[2024-09-21T01:15:14] GABE: This is for the M365
[2024-09-21T01:15:26] GABE: 2 separate projects going on.
[2024-09-21T01:15:43] GABE: Need tyres for the mijia, idk how I'll find money for that.
[2024-09-21T01:15:50] GABE: If 8.5" is cheaper I go with that
[2024-09-21T01:16:09] GABE: The mass payment is going all towards the G30
[2024-09-21T01:16:09] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-21T01:16:25] haku: if you can buy cigarettes you can buy a tire 😂
[2024-09-21T01:20:13] GABE: Possibly 3 if I put the stock esc in the ebike back in. All doable, just no copper, kapton or solder money.
[2024-09-21T01:20:24] GABE: Those are the things you neeeeeeeed
[2024-09-21T01:20:45] GABE: Gotta wait 18 more days And still no money for Brakes. I'm not using that shit without Hydraulics, but the scooter will be running on the desk, excited to see how it'll sound with some fwk, those 70hs.
[2024-09-21T01:21:00] GABE: You think I buy em, that's funny. where do you think I get my weed from
[2024-09-21T02:09:37] haku: this guy ballin af.
[2024-09-21T03:00:38] haku: my boy got his footsoldiers to line up
[2024-09-21T03:23:07] Finn: Is it 20s?
[2024-09-21T03:26:05] haku: no lol
[2024-09-21T03:26:14] haku: i think only 1
[2024-09-21T03:55:40] Noname: Surron boys with ski mask and it's 120°
[2024-09-21T03:57:15] haku: lol. its cooling here. maybe 92f haha
[2024-09-21T03:58:19] Finn: I like the minecraft helmet😁
[2024-09-21T09:48:19] NetworkDir: Mini Surron on top! I swear this little bike is much better than the Surron.
[2024-09-21T12:36:58] Rose: Hey there Sour Diesel, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2024-09-21T14:33:36] GABE: hands bleedin
[2024-09-21T14:36:45] puneDir: Yeah :F
[2024-09-21T14:45:07] puneDir: Man that shrink
[2024-09-21T14:52:02] GABE: All will be rewrapped.
[2024-09-21T14:52:18] GABE: it's inevitable
[2024-09-21T15:11:13] Yamal: I don’t know bro..! 😂
[2024-09-21T16:01:14] Yamal: In that plate there are bull testicles bro xD😂
[2024-09-21T16:02:08] Yamal: nuclear mixture we call it
[2024-09-21T16:06:17] Yamal: It is very good only with salt and pepper of spices, it does not need more, heart, liver for the most part, kidney...
[2024-09-21T16:25:20] Kenzo Kazan: Hello, I need help URGENTLY, my g4's handlebars shake extremely when going only 60 km/h and I want to get the most out of it, does anyone have a solution for that or a steering damper. Link or tutorial on how to fix.
[2024-09-21T16:25:27] Kenzo Kazan: Kukirin g4

[2024-09-21T16:52:13] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Have a plate of snails 🤣
[2024-09-21T16:53:00] 'lekrsu': You need to switch timezone😅
[2024-09-21T16:53:36] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I tighten the spring preload I have in the front and rear
[2024-09-21T17:25:46] GABE: G4 has a factory issue where the rear/front tubeless tyre is not straight.
[2024-09-21T17:26:13] GABE: I've tried to straighten it, but it seems impossible. New tyres seem to be essential.
[2024-09-21T17:26:28] GABE: You can try straighten it out.
[2024-09-21T17:26:47] GABE: Death wobble at 60kmh and need immense arm strength to prevent death
[2024-09-21T17:27:07] Kenzo Kazan: Later i send foto it looks normal
[2024-09-21T17:27:19] GABE: You have to look at the lips of the tyres.
[2024-09-21T17:27:51] GABE: Check all bolts, check also for the bolt that holds the Front shock, one of my customers said that bolt snapped, could've killed him.
[2024-09-21T17:28:00] Kenzo Kazan: Okey I will send you foto later
[2024-09-21T17:28:08] GABE: The bolt imploded into the shock and it held for months after
[2024-09-21T17:28:16] GABE: I was so surprised he didn't notice.
[2024-09-21T17:28:54] GABE: You wont go faster than 69 under any circumstance. I am 69kg and couldn't go faster than 69, even when controlling the death wobble
[2024-09-21T17:29:18] GABE: The G4 needs a new cell entirely, along with a new controller (if you wish), 100v100a would be perfect, entirely after purchase. The motor though, is incredibly high quality and strong, keep it, but install a temp sensor.
[2024-09-21T17:31:29] Kenzo Kazan: I’m 50 kg
[2024-09-21T17:32:03] Kenzo Kazan: Do I need a steering damper?
[2024-09-21T17:32:14] Kenzo Kazan: Do you have a link and a tutorial?
[2024-09-21T17:32:32] Jan: Lmao
[2024-09-21T17:33:55] Rose: Hey there Zlatabanica, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-09-21T17:33:56] Jan: That steering geometry is straight for the garbage
[2024-09-21T17:38:42] NetworkDir: the reason
[2024-09-21T17:39:17] NetworkDir: maybe putting bigger suspension can help
[2024-09-21T17:39:33] Kenzo Kazan: Yeah????
[2024-09-21T17:39:40] Kenzo Kazan: Can you pass link?
[2024-09-21T17:40:04] Kenzo Kazan: The biggest that it can
[2024-09-21T17:40:27] NetworkDir: measure current suspension
[2024-09-21T17:40:48] Kenzo Kazan: Okey
[2024-09-21T17:40:58] GABE: Hardly
[2024-09-21T17:41:18] GABE: at that point just make a new fork entirely
[2024-09-21T17:41:32] GABE: It snaps. my customers life was I danger
[2024-09-21T17:42:22] Jan: It already looks like proper sheetmetal garbage
[2024-09-21T17:42:39] GABE: The G4 is 1000€ RPP, you could've pimped out a G30 for that.
[2024-09-21T17:42:47] GABE: for like 300ish more
[2024-09-21T17:42:52] GABE: if possible, I'd return it
[2024-09-21T17:42:55] Jan: I just bought a G30 again
[2024-09-21T17:42:56] GABE: ASAP
[2024-09-21T17:42:59] GABE: Lol
[2024-09-21T17:43:00] Jan: 280€
[2024-09-21T17:43:05] NetworkDir: good price
[2024-09-21T17:43:07] GABE: My goddd
[2024-09-21T17:43:15] Jan: For 1000€ i can buy 3 frames
[2024-09-21T17:43:32] 'lekrsu': Challenge: run stock parts 🥹
[2024-09-21T17:43:57] Kenzo Kazan: And can y turn it around? Will it fix that?
[2024-09-21T17:44:12] Jan: That guy mounted 30km ago solid tires
[2024-09-21T17:44:18] Jan: Need to change them
[2024-09-21T17:44:32] Jan: Probably will do a long range G30
[2024-09-21T17:45:00] 'lekrsu': Who needs PMT when you can have solids
[2024-09-21T17:45:04] 'lekrsu': <sticker>

[2024-09-21T17:46:03] Jan: No spacer
[2024-09-21T17:46:05] 'lekrsu': I'll just stay with my 1300wh 20s6p G2 PPAH motor someday, 100 km range
[2024-09-21T17:46:52] GABE: Death
[2024-09-21T17:47:35] Kenzo Kazan: Why?
[2024-09-21T17:48:25] Kenzo Kazan: Like turn the wheel and everything
[2024-09-21T17:49:35] Kenzo Kazan: The suspension
[2024-09-21T17:49:38] Kenzo Kazan: All
[2024-09-21T17:50:52] GABE: Already bad geometry is made for the other way
[2024-09-21T17:51:07] GABE: You can't make it double bad. It would be like reversing a monorim suspension
[2024-09-21T17:51:20] GABE: One bad is" fine" two bads isn't.
[2024-09-21T17:57:20] crimeware: Yummy

[2024-09-21T18:11:40] Kenzo Kazan: Will a steering damper work?
[2024-09-21T18:18:08] Jan: Nothing
[2024-09-21T18:18:28] Jan: Damn front axle is killing me everytime
[2024-09-21T18:18:45] Jan: Its expensive and not worth the rebuild effort for this
[2024-09-21T18:20:03] Jan: Yes
[2024-09-21T18:20:54] Jan: Would love to have the shock for research
[2024-09-21T18:22:28] 'lekrsu': The wheel wobbles slightly in the fork, I've not taken it apart yet to look what it's doing. But everyone I know has this, and I wonder where exactly the moving part is happening.
[2024-09-21T18:29:31] GABE: Perfect fit. So far so good. 40% extra runtime will be huge
[2024-09-21T18:44:09] GABE: <photos/photo_17828@21-09-2024_18-44-09.jpg>
[2024-09-21T18:44:17] GABE: Have to cut with a hot knife @jamessoderstrom Cells were at 4.01v when I took them out ages ago, if memory recalls. I could fake the BMS without having to hack it.
[2024-09-21T18:45:30] GABE: This is literally what they should've done. Omg, companies are such assholes

[2024-09-21T23:03:48] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-09-21T23:04:14] haku: when i went to sandiego beach theres some of these bikini scooter riders. not on hyperscooters though
[2024-09-21T23:05:42] Yamal: HyperScooter, little on the street
[2024-09-21T23:06:45] haku: this girl on EUC always rides with a cameltoe. i need to find that video.
[2024-09-21T23:06:57] Yamal: For me, the hyperscooters on the market are the following in my opinion and of course they can be improved.
[2024-09-21T23:07:06] haku: im sure that popped up on your feed
[2024-09-21T23:08:07] haku: whatever it takes to get views. lmao https://youtube.com/shorts/KlGZWtYzDoA?si=SbaWuyIhoLgPjILI
[2024-09-21T23:08:57] haku: this world is going to hell
[2024-09-21T23:13:11] Yamal: Are there better scooters in racing today? Of course, for me they are the scooters par excellence in terms of performance,, but they do not go through the "production chain" It's my opinion.... Would I buy some of the hypers on the market? probably not, The one that catches my attention the most is the tricher moment and it's not that sub aesthetics is amazing, so the solution is to mount it on a good frame...
[2024-09-21T23:13:36] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-09-21T23:14:46] haku: if i was ballin and dont care pricetags sure. but you can build a better one than those high end hyoerscooters
[2024-09-21T23:15:38] Yamal: Never say the brand Rion Apex Momen tricher Slack Velity Emove roadster I doubt it
[2024-09-21T23:15:44] haku: like this guy.
[2024-09-21T23:16:56] Yamal: 8000€ for this scooter ,?
[2024-09-21T23:17:13] haku: its a custom hyperscooter
[2024-09-21T23:17:36] Yamal: No no no
[2024-09-21T23:17:47] haku: according to reddit there is a difference
[2024-09-21T23:18:40] Yamal: Hyper build
[2024-09-21T23:22:29] haku: different scooter pronouns. commuter scooter and hyper scooter
[2024-09-21T23:23:09] haku: thats what i learned from reddit
[2024-09-21T23:23:50] haku: im sure there more scooter pronouns
[2024-09-21T23:26:17] haku: reddit wants you to buy thier brand of hyperscooter if you want to be cool amd fast

[2024-09-21T23:27:41] Noname: lol let me find something 4 you
[2024-09-21T23:30:16] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is it ok to put connectors in the middle?
[2024-09-21T23:30:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Because it's good for change tires
[2024-09-21T23:30:48] Lisa: Hello guys, I have a question the 84100 MKS how much A can it really output at 20S?
[2024-09-21T23:30:51] Noname: @Bradhaku check your dms. Lol cant post here
[2024-09-21T23:31:15] Yamal: but if you realize the phase cuts are at different heights, I recently saw it on other scooters
[2024-09-21T23:31:19] Pandalgns: Safe or unsafe??
[2024-09-21T23:31:21] Pandalgns: 😂😂
[2024-09-21T23:31:37] Lisa: Safe and unsafe 🤣
[2024-09-21T23:31:37] Yamal: Cool ⚡️
[2024-09-21T23:32:39] Pandalgns: Safe 120a... unsafe... pune knows how long they last but I have them with the firmware without limits and I have 180a phase
[2024-09-21T23:32:46] Yamal: I don't know but in my opinion it is safe so that there is never contact or am I hallucinating...?
[2024-09-21T23:33:21] Pandalgns: I think that after 200 they start to heat up a little
[2024-09-21T23:33:34] Lisa: On alixpress Peak says 200A I got a 75100 to 200A so I may think it could handle the same more or less
[2024-09-21T23:34:11] Pandalgns: Peak 200 a few seconds, nominal 120
[2024-09-21T23:34:34] Pandalgns: But fets can support more
[2024-09-21T23:34:46] Pandalgns: @punedir
[2024-09-21T23:35:06] Lisa: Also why would be the 84100HP better then 75100 or 75200 and 84200HP
[2024-09-21T23:35:10] Lisa: Cutoff right?
[2024-09-21T23:35:32] Pandalgns: Is better than 75 series
[2024-09-21T23:35:55] Pandalgns: But 84200 is better i think
[2024-09-21T23:36:31] Lisa: Yes but why is it better than 75 series
[2024-09-21T23:36:45] Lisa: Either 84100 or ubox lite but idk
[2024-09-21T23:36:53] puneDir: Hey
[2024-09-21T23:37:02] puneDir: 180 is safe
[2024-09-21T23:37:48] Yamal: 84/200 Safe ….?
[2024-09-21T23:38:02] Pandalgns: It has six and another six in parallel which means that if I'm not mistaken it is about 700a since they are mosfets with more than 300 amps and I think it comes with a 12v power supply and a few more things I think
[2024-09-21T23:38:11] NetworkDir: 250
[2024-09-21T23:39:12] Pandalgns: 84200?? I still buy the 84200 for the halo and add 350a phase to each motor, it is safe
[2024-09-21T23:39:20] haku: spintend?
[2024-09-21T23:39:32] Pandalgns: Or not 😂😂
[2024-09-21T23:39:40] NetworkDir: Yes idk about mks
[2024-09-21T23:40:08] NetworkDir: Spintend 12 fet version easily can handle 250A
[2024-09-21T23:40:23] Yamal: I asking about mks ^^'
[2024-09-21T23:40:29] haku: well ive seen the 12fet mks for $100. big price difference but maybe putting money in the trash
[2024-09-21T23:40:44] Yamal: Becaouse they talking about 84/100 mks
[2024-09-21T23:40:59] NetworkDir: Should same but who knows quality and life time
[2024-09-21T23:41:02] Pandalgns: Fets are 300a more true?
[2024-09-21T23:41:32] NetworkDir: Makerbase show the HQ and zero problems XDD
[2024-09-21T23:41:33] Lisa: 75200 exploded just today when I plugged them in
[2024-09-21T23:41:58] Lisa: I think even 400A peak
[2024-09-21T23:42:13] haku: dang so its that bad then
[2024-09-21T23:42:27] NetworkDir: Yeah rated 250A safe and can do more fuckeria amps
[2024-09-21T23:42:34] haku: maybe okay for 30-50a builds
[2024-09-21T23:42:40] Lisa: Yes motor detection bad af but the newer 75200 v2 did good detection tbh when it worked
[2024-09-21T23:42:43] NetworkDir: No bro
[2024-09-21T23:42:54] Yamal: I think big spintend 300A safe
[2024-09-21T23:42:57] NetworkDir: For 5-6kW builds just buy ubox lite
[2024-09-21T23:43:10] NetworkDir: Yeah depends cooling conditions
[2024-09-21T23:43:16] NetworkDir: But 250-300A ez
[2024-09-21T23:43:31] NetworkDir: Ubox is OG
[2024-09-21T23:43:32] Pandalgns: The makerbase mount mosfets of more than 300a... the 84100 has 6, the 84200 6 and 6 in parallel, so I understand that it supports more than 700a but it should not be safe
[2024-09-21T23:43:51] NetworkDir: Your math wrong about mosfets
[2024-09-21T23:44:00] haku: i wonder if spintend gonna come out with a 18fet. theres a market for those

[2024-09-22T00:30:39] haku: you also get tents on your yard
[2024-09-22T00:31:16] Noname: Could have a tiny house postage stamp yard on the lake here for 750k
[2024-09-22T00:31:42] haku: well when california gets the big earthquake theyve been saying las vegas will be beach front

[2024-09-22T00:56:02] Yamal: Pit bull terrier xD
[2024-09-22T00:58:10] haku: Noname whats the bit/chuck i need to turn this into an impact wrench?
[2024-09-22T01:03:42] Yamal: https://youtu.be/6FLVv4T46Ns?si=a4ILe3vFVf-N2QM
[2024-09-22T01:05:55] haku: i cannot trust those tiny tires and e brakes.
[2024-09-22T01:06:28] haku: i have trust issues with speed and small tires for some reason
[2024-09-22T01:06:59] Yamal: Yes …
[2024-09-22T01:07:12] Noname: 1/4" hex
[2024-09-22T01:09:33] haku: do you like using these for scooters or you rather use drill?
[2024-09-22T01:12:33] Noname: Hex drill bits no but socket adapter all day every day
[2024-09-22T01:13:29] Noname: To fast and impact chips drills unless it's wood
[2024-09-22T01:14:21] haku: ive never really used these. i always ratchet by hand and use drill bits for screws
[2024-09-22T01:34:45] haku: so impact wrench is good for tightening bolts for motors? its like lug nuts right?
[2024-09-22T01:35:21] Noname: So much to learn
[2024-09-22T01:35:49] haku: ive seen folks use these for lug nuts
[2024-09-22T01:36:41] Noname: Need throttle control for small bolts like split rim otherwise strip city. No for car lug nuts unless your just spinning them on fast not enough beans. Also a heavy socket "impact" rated gives more beans than a chrome one
[2024-09-22T01:37:33] Noname: A 1/2 or 3/8 impact can do lugs bit hex is good for lag bolts or screws and small hardware
[2024-09-22T01:37:52] haku: oh i see
[2024-09-22T01:38:35] haku: is it good for threading metal holes? or need control for that
[2024-09-22T01:38:48] Noname: Tapping
[2024-09-22T01:39:04] haku: yes thats the word
[2024-09-22T01:39:09] Noname: Can do but shouldn't. You cut threads not hammer threads
[2024-09-22T01:39:46] Noname: Literally a hammer that impacts the rotation of bit.
[2024-09-22T01:39:55] Noname: Taps are hard but shatter
[2024-09-22T01:40:03] haku: i see
[2024-09-22T01:40:34] haku: for rusty bolts
[2024-09-22T01:41:07] Noname: High speed has no torque until it starts hammering.
[2024-09-22T01:54:11] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Now I understand why you want phase amp high
[2024-09-22T01:54:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 60/170cm

[2024-09-22T03:30:19] Noname: Good thing scooters are chick repellent then
[2024-09-22T03:30:35] Noname: Although still a money pit
[2024-09-22T03:30:40] crimeware: I won't forget that sentence, it's stuck in my head and I repeat it when I see a cameltoe
[2024-09-22T03:30:47] haku: nah not about that life anymore.these are thirst traps. good girls go to church not for the streets
[2024-09-22T03:31:11] Noname: Craft stores too
[2024-09-22T03:31:24] crimeware: I just send the link to watch for free in case you are curious
[2024-09-22T03:32:02] crimeware: And yes, she rides euc naked
[2024-09-22T03:32:06] Noname: https://youtube.com/shorts/kAWWgckaRWQ?feature=shared
[2024-09-22T03:32:14] haku: ive already seen it. buddy showed me
[2024-09-22T03:32:23] Noname: I sent him the gif earlier
[2024-09-22T03:33:01] crimeware: Now you have the source in 4k 60fps dolby atmos WAV 44khz
[2024-09-22T03:33:24] crimeware: 7.1 surround sounds with extra goy
[2024-09-22T03:34:06] haku: shes made quite a following on youtube too
[2024-09-22T03:34:23] Noname: Cool that my phone can play it on my 75" tv
[2024-09-22T03:34:25] crimeware: "It always started with a slit & ended up with two kids a divorce & a money hell pit."
[2024-09-22T03:34:36] haku: she should review my mini bike
[2024-09-22T03:34:47] crimeware: Which way?
[2024-09-22T03:35:43] crimeware: I think her reviews arw worthless, if she fucks it people know not to buy. If she doesn't fuck it, people will also not buy.
[2024-09-22T03:36:16] Noname: She reviews things? 😆
[2024-09-22T03:36:25] crimeware: Depends who you ask
[2024-09-22T03:36:26] Noname: Mabey sound was off
[2024-09-22T03:36:39] crimeware: And the pants down?
[2024-09-22T03:37:01] Noname: Directions unclear penis caught in ceiling fan

[2024-09-22T03:40:34] crimeware: Do you expect me to be a law cuck?
[2024-09-22T03:40:41] Noname: Thought it was crime wave but read it and now it's not as good
[2024-09-22T03:40:58] crimeware: Runs down like a knife
[2024-09-22T03:41:18] Noname: Hey I J walk. We don't all follow rules
[2024-09-22T03:41:46] haku: damn my boy went full peasant battery died.

[2024-09-22T03:42:17] Noname: Need a lil exercise no 5yr old needs a dad bod
[2024-09-22T03:43:03] crimeware: We had fun today
[2024-09-22T03:43:10] Noname: Make him push the bike to regen. Say it's only way to charge
[2024-09-22T03:43:35] haku: that little bike what is it?
[2024-09-22T03:43:43] crimeware: Which bike?
[2024-09-22T03:44:07] haku: infront of you left of the scooter
[2024-09-22T03:44:35] crimeware: Forgot the brands name but I know em both
[2024-09-22T03:44:49] crimeware: That bike has max 15mph & can only reach 15miles
[2024-09-22T03:45:12] Noname: Sweet a ride out. Why you on rental?
[2024-09-22T03:45:25] haku: not if you upgrade battery
[2024-09-22T03:46:04] Noname: Piece of shit though
[2024-09-22T03:46:13] haku: how you disable gps on these?
[2024-09-22T03:49:01] haku: im not about theft but these big companies can afford them. they also have predatory practices
[2024-09-22T03:50:16] haku: i still want an snsc though. waiting for one to be right infront of me
[2024-09-22T03:52:32] Noname: This usa definitely good for the environment
[2024-09-22T03:52:51] haku: dang. thats insane
[2024-09-22T03:53:19] Noname: What happened to thousands of defunct Spin scooters https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/local-news/thousands-of-defunct-spin-scooters-that-were-headed-to-landfill-to-be-refurbished-in-akron
[2024-09-22T03:54:16] Noname: If I could deactivate them I could grab a truck full in the city NP
[2024-09-22T03:54:31] Noname: They're all over the place
[2024-09-22T03:54:59] Noname: Na thanks just haku
[2024-09-22T03:55:21] haku: ive heard this. thats crazy.
[2024-09-22T03:55:43] haku: i want snsc ninebot though not the other frames
[2024-09-22T03:58:40] haku: oh wow
[2024-09-22T03:58:55] Noname: Jail ain't worth a used sync
[2024-09-22T03:59:11] Noname: Bad enough he wanted the streetbike
[2024-09-22T03:59:56] crimeware: Stealing baaaad. Stealing from greedy company gooood. Stealing private baaad. Commiting tax fraud gooood.
[2024-09-22T04:00:30] haku: i just take free trash. sometimes i ask if it is
[2024-09-22T04:00:44] Noname: Lol just don't park it on your property. Otherwise it malfunctioned and idk I just rode it..
[2024-09-22T04:01:23] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Tax fraud I can understand but stealing no bro
[2024-09-22T04:01:24] crimeware: 😖 we haven't talked about shit, you guys don't know me
[2024-09-22T04:02:58] Noname: Probably shouldn't 😆
[2024-09-22T04:05:07] crimeware: I just came in here to ask if someone manages to get the Ninebot G2 dash working on VESC
[2024-09-22T04:07:10] crimeware: I just want working turn lights 😭
[2024-09-22T04:09:14] Noname: Girls theft and being poor were the nightly chats. No time left for that.
[2024-09-22T04:11:06] haku: what pisses me off is when kids ask to pet your dog with thier dirty hands buy you cant say no to them
[2024-09-22T04:12:35] crimeware: Just grab a bottle of tap water & soap with you
[2024-09-22T04:13:04] crimeware: So mommy & daddy can be happy they washed their hands TWICE
[2024-09-22T04:14:32] Noname: <animation>
[2024-09-22T04:15:41] haku: thats exaxtly it. chalk hands, dirt hands and food hands. but they are kids. it would be evil to deny them
[2024-09-22T04:17:57] crimeware: Claim ur dog is aggressive 😂😭
[2024-09-22T04:19:19] haku: they already know hes not lol. same kids everytime
[2024-09-22T04:22:19] crimeware: Ahhhhh

[2024-09-22T04:23:26] Noname: Giant happy fluff ball
[2024-09-22T04:53:06] crimeware: I am trying to make a ninebot G30 V5

[2024-09-22T05:56:07] haku: i dont have a tictok but saw this on telegram lmao.
[2024-09-22T05:56:57] haku: very true. when i was younger it gets competitive out there
[2024-09-22T05:57:56] haku: not even with 6pack abs and an alright asian face. cant compete with the whites

[2024-09-22T06:00:17] Noname: Contradicting yourelf
[2024-09-22T06:00:32] Noname: What you mean
[2024-09-22T06:00:50] haku: i dont want to say white privilage. because its not but its true when it comes to women
[2024-09-22T06:01:34] Noname: Don't even want to say how long since 😒 I'm invisable

[2024-09-22T13:50:15] FreehandZ: I counted 20 rows 🤔
[2024-09-22T13:50:17] puneDir: Its 20
[2024-09-22T13:50:19] puneDir: 21700

[2024-09-22T13:52:58] puneDir: Ye
[2024-09-22T13:52:59] puneDir: Cuz 21700
[2024-09-22T13:53:28] Yamal: but now I understand, I've been around for 20s but my batteries are not completely parallel.

[2024-09-22T13:55:32] Yamal: 40t
[2024-09-22T13:55:37] Pandalgns: nice
[2024-09-22T13:55:59] Pandalgns: i have a friend with vtc6a to sell
[2024-09-22T13:56:25] GABE: so hot
[2024-09-22T13:56:26] GABE: omg
[2024-09-22T13:56:27] Pandalgns: i dont know what use, vtc6a or molicel
[2024-09-22T13:57:58] GABE: Have to disassemble this, feels like killing my child.
[2024-09-22T13:57:58] FreehandZ: Slow ish, video is 600mm/s, 35k accel, 10 scv. I tested working up to 900mm/s 50k accel 20scv, not satisfactory or what I expected. I didn't check motor currents though
[2024-09-22T13:58:09] FreehandZ: Was default current from template
[2024-09-22T13:59:12] Pandalgns: wow... i have k1max at 300mms 10k acel and is so fast... ur printer is a fucking ferrari xDD
[2024-09-22T13:59:49] FreehandZ: When you get into custom printers or building printers you can start looking at the fast bois haha
[2024-09-22T14:00:06] FreehandZ: Or do you have a couple?
[2024-09-22T14:00:23] FreehandZ: Vorons are slow heh
[2024-09-22T14:01:14] Pandalgns: I have seen some custom printers but they are too much for me at least for now hehehe, sometimes I go crazy with this one to configure parameters to get into those that are another league
[2024-09-22T14:01:33] FreehandZ: K1 seems like a pretty good printer tbf
[2024-09-22T14:01:46] FreehandZ: It's a huge rabbit hole
[2024-09-22T14:02:07] FreehandZ: Servos are crazier, but you cannot participate in the speedbenchy challenge

[2024-09-22T14:16:11] Happy Giraffe: Ice cream box I think
[2024-09-22T14:16:56] Pandalgns: Flipsky flavor 😂😂
[2024-09-22T14:18:24] puneDir: I cant do like this cuz zero is small
[2024-09-22T14:23:07] 'lekrsu': nice sane values
[2024-09-22T14:30:03] haku: is the friend from this group?
[2024-09-22T14:30:27] haku: use molicel imo
[2024-09-22T14:34:54] Pandalgns: Nope
[2024-09-22T14:36:27] Pandalgns: He is a friend who is dedicated to the construction and sale of batteries and cells from here in Spain and has cells of all types, 18650, 21700, Samsung, LG, Sony, Molicel, etc.
[2024-09-22T14:38:16] FreehandZ: 40pl 👌
[2024-09-22T14:38:26] FreehandZ: I'm gonna get some in a month or 2
[2024-09-22T14:39:12] Pandalgns: He have 40t and vtc6a now i know and probably molicel in a time
[2024-09-22T15:06:14] GABE: Footrest will need incorporated intake valves for the MP2s to have cooling. Shouldnt be too hard to weld..
[2024-09-22T15:06:33] GABE: I knew I shouldn't have thrown away that GPU.... The Fins from that would be perfect for this.
[2024-09-22T15:06:56] GABE: Total fuckeria tho
[2024-09-22T15:08:15] GABE: BMS doesn't heat that much does it? I think it'll do with the back of the aluminium frame, no third intake valve needed.
[2024-09-22T15:13:21] Jan: Pls dont 😅
[2024-09-22T15:15:35] Jan: You dont need, technically the rear tire moves air radially around it
[2024-09-22T15:15:48] Jan: Aluminum block with fins towards the tire
[2024-09-22T15:28:09] GABE: Like this?
[2024-09-22T15:28:17] GABE: ESCS red, BMS purple fins blue duh
[2024-09-22T15:29:38] GABE: Or this
[2024-09-22T15:31:04] Jan: Fins radial along the rubber of the tire
[2024-09-22T15:31:27] GABE: so the second option
[2024-09-22T15:31:53] GABE: ?
[2024-09-22T15:32:23] Jan: The radial airflow is quite strong at higher speeds, thats for cars it can generate some weird lift behavior. Thats why race cars have slits to remove that airflow, but in your case you can use it to cool.
[2024-09-22T15:32:42] Jan: <photos/photo_17859@22-09-2024_15-32-42.jpg>
[2024-09-22T15:32:56] GABE: Ah, that would cause the car to lift.
[2024-09-22T15:32:59] GABE: a bit
[2024-09-22T15:33:04] GABE: meaning faster speeds
[2024-09-22T15:33:11] GABE: Okay so, the fins should be on sides instead? this is kinda confusing
[2024-09-22T15:33:50] GABE: which option
[2024-09-22T15:33:50] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-22T15:34:09] Jan: You need fins along the radial direction of the tire and have a closed airflow around the tire
[2024-09-22T15:34:37] Jan: It will generate a low pressure zone under the floor where the air is sucked along the rubber of the tire upwards over the fins
[2024-09-22T15:35:03] Jan: Cars dont want this as it generates lift and you need downforce, so you break that airflow away from the tire
[2024-09-22T15:35:20] Jan: But you dont need rear downforce
[2024-09-22T15:35:26] Jan: Repurpose that airflow
[2024-09-22T15:35:43] Jan: The tire acts its own as the fan
[2024-09-22T15:36:00] GABE: Fans? Banned .
[2024-09-22T15:36:07] Jan: Yes XD
[2024-09-22T15:36:12] Jan: You never need a fan
[2024-09-22T15:36:33] Jan: Tires spin and your vehicle is moving, that generates more airflow than any fan could
[2024-09-22T15:37:03] GABE: How closed would it have to be, will a regular mudguard like thing like a Bolt scooter be enough
[2024-09-22T15:37:13] GABE: enough to suction in
[2024-09-22T15:37:14] Jan: Why do cars have radiator fans is because when the car is not moving, the engine still runs and produces heat, while electric vehicles dont
[2024-09-22T15:37:39] Jan: Regular mudguard would be ok, the more you close it the stronger the flow
[2024-09-22T15:37:54] GABE: Surely don't need much to saturate 2x 70h anyways.
[2024-09-22T15:38:05] GABE: thanks for the help
[2024-09-22T15:38:08] GABE: Ur smart.
[2024-09-22T15:38:11] Jan: Fender with some rubber sideskirts would be the more optimal
[2024-09-22T15:38:15] Jan: But it works without
[2024-09-22T15:42:48] Jan: Like this
[2024-09-22T15:43:10] Jan: The tire and the mudguard form a tunnel and the spinning tire is the fan
[2024-09-22T15:43:55] GABE: i was just thinking about this. oh my god, so much engineering, its good tho.
[2024-09-22T15:43:56] Jan: The physics is boundary layer momentum transfer
[2024-09-22T15:44:24] Jan: The Tesla Turbine uses that concept with fluid, but very thin laminar layers
[2024-09-22T15:44:38] GABE: did you premake this?
[2024-09-22T15:44:40] GABE: lmao
[2024-09-22T15:44:45] Jan: I just did now in 20seconds
[2024-09-22T15:44:49] Jan: google slides
[2024-09-22T15:48:10] GABE: Exhausts on sides so the hot air doesn't mix with the new air.
[2024-09-22T15:48:29] GABE: Lemme draw more
[2024-09-22T15:49:22] Jan: You can also have the "intake" higher
[2024-09-22T15:49:44] GABE: <photos/photo_17862@22-09-2024_15-49-44.jpg>
[2024-09-22T15:50:02] GABE: BMS I just realized can be INTERNAL cause the cell will be so high lol OMG
[2024-09-22T15:50:09] GABE: I don't need an external BMS @lekrsu
[2024-09-22T15:50:14] Jan: I wouldnt over complicate things on the exhaust, that air temp is minimal higher
[2024-09-22T15:52:42] GABE: I prefer paper, idk how you use that computer shizzle.
[2024-09-22T15:52:48] GABE: Paper is paper
[2024-09-22T15:53:02] GABE: So a less bad looking mudguard.
[2024-09-22T15:56:42] Jan: Less complicated, => less time to build it needed
[2024-09-22T15:57:20] Izuna 生活: This looks amazing. Gosh I want one.
[2024-09-22T16:02:46] puneDir: Ev's got fans for cooling too
[2024-09-22T16:11:16] Jan: Yes not all
[2024-09-22T16:11:42] Jan: Then you additionally radiate the heat away from the sink while standing still
[2024-09-22T16:12:30] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I I find plastic electrical box is a fan enough for cooling?
[2024-09-22T16:12:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Or2
[2024-09-22T16:14:59] Patrick: Hi, does anyone here have experience with these cables? They are apparently rated at 800°C, which makes them interesting for me, mainly because the insulation looks much thinner than on classic silicone cables. If no one here has ever had experience with these cables, I would order 1x 10mm², 1x 20mm² & 1x 6mm² and send the external dimensions here and test them for temperature. If the insulation is really that thin, I'm also curious to see if you can get 6mm² in as motor phases for the 65h 33x2, then you can push a lot through the motor.
[2024-09-22T16:23:48] puneDir: Most of the power tools are brushed

[2024-09-22T16:37:24] Rose: Hey there Macel2001, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-09-22T16:41:47] haku: old ones are but the big brand new ones are not anymore
[2024-09-22T16:43:23] Jan: Factory doesnt do it, lots of people asked
[2024-09-22T16:43:35] Jan: Would be great to have
[2024-09-22T16:53:04] Paolo ⁭: The stock one is super thin and 200C capanle
[2024-09-22T16:57:38] GABE: EVS need a radiator for obvious reasons
[2024-09-22T16:57:45] GABE: ESC AND Motor fluid.
[2024-09-22T16:57:51] GABE: RC cars do it.
[2024-09-22T16:57:54] GABE: It's not fantasy.
[2024-09-22T16:58:06] GABE: It works surprisingly well, I mean very well.
[2024-09-22T16:58:06] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-22T16:59:09] Rose: Hey there Frah, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-09-22T17:07:03] Patrick: Found them on ebay after a long search
[2024-09-22T17:07:15] Patrick: While searching for a factory found a ebay seller
[2024-09-22T17:07:22] Jan: The cables?
[2024-09-22T17:07:23] Patrick: https://www.ebay.com/itm/Heat-Resistant-High-Temperature-Glass-Fibre-Wire-cable-800C-/153643691485?_ul=CO
[2024-09-22T17:07:27] Patrick: Yes
[2024-09-22T17:07:32] Patrick: Cheap too
[2024-09-22T17:07:41] Jan: The cables is not really the problem, the work is
[2024-09-22T17:07:51] Jan: It takes hours to do
[2024-09-22T17:08:15] Jan: If you wanna sell motors and you do each motor your own, you gonna waste time
[2024-09-22T17:08:18] Patrick: Ah yea i got time i mean lonnyo 65H fits 10awg
[2024-09-22T17:08:32] Patrick: If i can fit 6mm² with these wires it would be great
[2024-09-22T17:08:44] Patrick: Cant find Informations to the full diameter sadly
[2024-09-22T17:10:06] Patrick: Ordered 1x 6mm² for now if they are flexible enough i also get some thicker once for battery connections
[2024-09-22T17:28:12] puneDir: Battery too
[2024-09-22T17:32:53] GABE: Air filter works no? Tesla's have one anyways. it could just have two.

[2024-09-22T18:05:33] 'lekrsu': Having proper torque control is nice. Some older brushed ones are painful to use haha

[2024-09-22T18:43:12] puneDir: @jamessoderstrom @PaoloWu Elshan says makerbase 84100 uses fake mosfets and second hand chips
[2024-09-22T18:43:19] puneDir: Can someone shut him up?
[2024-09-22T18:43:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: We don't like him guess why?
[2024-09-22T18:44:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Who cares if it works ?
[2024-09-22T18:44:12] Yamal: You don’t like asi bac
[2024-09-22T18:44:18] puneDir: i care
[2024-09-22T18:44:23] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: On the point
[2024-09-22T18:44:33] puneDir: hes ubox fanboy
[2024-09-22T18:44:39] puneDir: with shit adc xD
[2024-09-22T18:44:43] Paolo ⁭: This is actually true, they does
[2024-09-22T18:44:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ubox has their problems too
[2024-09-22T18:44:55] puneDir: Fake mosfets?
[2024-09-22T18:45:03] puneDir: He crashed 2 times because adc noise
[2024-09-22T18:45:10] Paolo ⁭: MOSFET I don't think , but STM yes
[2024-09-22T18:45:19] puneDir: Hmm
[2024-09-22T18:45:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The dual 100/100 black one there is a reason why they don't sell it anymore
[2024-09-22T18:45:48] puneDir: Why
[2024-09-22T18:46:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Had problems with firmwares above 5.2
[2024-09-22T18:46:27] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: James knows he also uses them in his builds
[2024-09-22T18:46:41] Paolo ⁭: They used very much second hand STM
[2024-09-22T18:46:51] puneDir: Not fake right
[2024-09-22T18:46:55] Paolo ⁭: That's why many ESC failed randomly
[2024-09-22T18:46:59] Paolo ⁭: Some were fake, yes
[2024-09-22T18:47:10] puneDir: I had that too
[2024-09-22T18:47:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: How can u prove such thing ?
[2024-09-22T18:47:35] Paolo ⁭: Because when was global chip shortage and STM costing 28$ each , how you think they can sell unit for 75$?
[2024-09-22T18:47:54] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Was
[2024-09-22T18:48:06] puneDir: Yes but covid ended 3 years ago
[2024-09-22T18:48:39] Paolo ⁭: I know my things, I don't need to prove you. You don't believe your problem , just don't cry if controller randomly dies :)
[2024-09-22T18:48:57] puneDir: Paolo is pro
[2024-09-22T18:49:19] Paolo ⁭: I've no reason to blame flipsky and makerbase, I have 50 of their esc
[2024-09-22T18:49:41] puneDir: What you think about mks 84100
[2024-09-22T18:49:58] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Maybe the 75s they are old but 84100 is new
[2024-09-22T18:50:00] Paolo ⁭: And actually owning on my wolf. And I don't sell nothing else esc😅
[2024-09-22T18:50:32] puneDir: I love 75100 box
[2024-09-22T18:50:46] puneDir: My fav esc Idk why
[2024-09-22T18:52:23] Paolo ⁭: I don't know about 84100, I talking of 75100. But the brand is the same, if they did this, I wouldn't trust more anyway for my main scooter
[2024-09-22T18:52:52] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 75100alu is dumb can't read motor correct
[2024-09-22T18:53:05] haku: he is. he uses a good camera. thats my people
[2024-09-22T18:54:27] puneDir: were cooked

[2024-09-22T18:57:42] puneDir: Sucks
[2024-09-22T18:57:49] Yamal: Use until die
[2024-09-22T18:58:06] puneDir: If it dies Im trashing the scoot
[2024-09-22T18:58:27] puneDir: I rebuilded the thing for like 5 times
[2024-09-22T19:01:12] Yamal: You have to race Mizan and his colleague from Venon! destroy them in a straight line that I know you can!
[2024-09-22T19:02:06] puneDir: i got my new cells from the builder of venom :D
[2024-09-22T19:02:18] puneDir: Mizan etc are our friends

[2024-09-22T19:03:38] Yamal: Far
[2024-09-22T19:04:04] Yamal: How many kilometers is Turkey from end to end?
[2024-09-22T19:04:39] puneDir: 1650
[2024-09-22T19:04:49] Yamal: This man is funny
[2024-09-22T19:06:08] Yamal: looks like M.A
[2024-09-22T19:06:17] puneDir: hes volkan polat
[2024-09-22T19:06:22] puneDir: The builder of venom
[2024-09-22T19:06:44] puneDir: He has faster scoots to Hes new shit goes like yamaha mt07
[2024-09-22T19:06:47] Yamal: Spain south to north 1000 around,, a little more

[2024-09-22T19:09:50] Yamal: I have also been able to see Mizan in some videos helping people and such apart from the scooters,,👍
[2024-09-22T19:16:08] haku: anyone have this problem with ly phases its not completely covered with pvc theres an exposed part in the middle.
[2024-09-22T19:17:08] Paolo ⁭: It's not problem, the shrink is only needed to sign phase color.
[2024-09-22T19:18:39] Yamal: The end never buy x12,,?
[2024-09-22T19:22:38] haku: i see. i thought the colored shrink makes it waterproof
[2024-09-22T19:26:52] Happy Giraffe: Ice cream box junkie edition
[2024-09-22T19:28:17] Happy Giraffe: Bought 100€ ebike without battery today, thinking of slapping a tiny cheapo ubox and then using my old 48v pack on it. Stock electronics might not handle 48v and dont wanna burn the esc😁
[2024-09-22T19:33:34] Paolo ⁭: Idk how is x12, you will be our tester😁
[2024-09-22T19:38:20] Yamal: X12 They are good and they are powerful
[2024-09-22T19:41:35] Yamal: Also today some namis with g300 were seen in the wonderful races!
[2024-09-22T19:41:54] Finn: Hopefully you can push more amps. Mine with front motor saturates at 11A phase
[2024-09-22T19:42:25] Finn: <photos/photo_17867@22-09-2024_19-42-25.jpg>
[2024-09-22T19:47:56] Happy Giraffe: Interesting, Im hoping 30-40A phase
[2024-09-22T19:48:28] Finn: Maybe its just a setting issue i have
[2024-09-22T19:49:26] Happy Giraffe: I got a spare Gmac 10T rear geared motor I would like to try with 72v but it has a fuked bearing inside so gotta machine special tool for it at work...
[2024-09-22T19:49:45] Happy Giraffe: What settings did you try? Mostly observer etc
[2024-09-22T19:50:18] Finn: I tried both of the observer and one of them works better at low speed
[2024-09-22T19:50:34] Finn: saturation compensation factor to 15% but still cant draw more then 11A
[2024-09-22T19:50:44] Finn: also using Flipsky 75100
[2024-09-22T19:50:54] Happy Giraffe: Flipsky might be the reason
[2024-09-22T19:51:15] Finn: Im not investing more in the ebike xD
[2024-09-22T19:51:19] Finn: its just not worth it
[2024-09-22T19:51:58] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, investment needs to be beforehand haha. Thats why I also put some Ubox minimum and avoid all budget vesc
[2024-09-22T19:52:17] Happy Giraffe: Also got batt ready so max 150€ to make it running
[2024-09-22T19:52:25] Finn: got the flipsky for only 40€
[2024-09-22T19:52:40] Happy Giraffe: Not too bad
[2024-09-22T19:52:42] Finn: and 1kwh batt was almost free from a good friend
[2024-09-22T19:53:05] Finn: <photos/photo_17868@22-09-2024_19-53-05.jpg>
[2024-09-22T19:53:18] Happy Giraffe: Burned motor maybe
[2024-09-22T19:53:24] Finn: its brand new
[2024-09-22T19:53:30] Happy Giraffe: 200mOhm is insane
[2024-09-22T19:53:43] Finn: these phase wires are thin af
[2024-09-22T19:53:53] Finn: also 2 meter phase cable
[2024-09-22T19:53:58] Finn: <photos/photo_17869@22-09-2024_19-53-58.jpg>
[2024-09-22T19:55:31] Happy Giraffe: Mine too, will see what happens. I think I beef them up and use some more handy controller like this: Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! €46.06 | Higo L1019 Cable Connector Customade 10 Pin Motor Wire Waterproof 3 Phrase and 7 Signal Bafang RM G060.1000 Fat Hub https://a.aliexpress.com/_Ey62PXB
[2024-09-22T19:56:05] haku: thats a ebike? where is the motor?
[2024-09-22T19:56:16] Happy Giraffe: Front😂
[2024-09-22T19:56:41] haku: stealthy
[2024-09-22T19:56:48] Happy Giraffe: I leave stock cables max 20cm long. Damn thin ones
[2024-09-22T20:12:22] Patrick: Ordered 2m 6mm² now takes 1-2 months until they arrive😢
[2024-09-22T20:13:44] Happy Giraffe: Any reason for avoidin silicone coated wires? Shielding?
[2024-09-22T20:16:04] Patrick: Yes again to be on the safe side that nothing burns and the hope with the cables here is that the insulation is much thinner so that I can get 6mm² instead of 5.26mm²
[2024-09-22T20:17:10] Patrick: Cable is rated 800°C so i am 100% on the save side xD
[2024-09-22T20:17:36] Patrick: Also fitting 0.74mm² more would be good
[2024-09-22T20:18:06] puneDir: Is single core copper wire ok for motor cable?
[2024-09-22T20:20:17] Patrick: Not that flexible just take multi core wires
[2024-09-22T20:28:16] Happy Giraffe: Might break down if twisted or pulled too many times. Usually nobody uses it
[2024-09-22T20:34:36] Tortilla Végh: Hey does anybody know the 50h 21x3 saturation point?
[2024-09-22T21:35:56] haku: so fake fets? thats crazy. what are the actual capabilities of the fets and components

[2024-09-23T00:15:34] haku: i need to sell mine and get g30 parts. is that a bad idea?
[2024-09-23T00:17:00] haku: maybe resale value on g30 will be bad idk
[2024-09-23T00:17:43] haku: 50h g30 seems like a good idea
[2024-09-23T00:17:57] Yamal: but you want to prepare a g30

[2024-09-23T00:19:06] Lucky Luciano: 4kw is also no issue, i didnt got it over 50c no matter what 4,6kw was max Peak, someone else pushed 180A thru it and dint got over 70c
[2024-09-23T00:19:09] haku: i wanted 11 last year but i want the portability of 10
[2024-09-23T00:19:54] Lucky Luciano: I guess the Alu version is better than the old copper one, but dont know for sure
[2024-09-23T00:21:39] Yamal: Have 6 fet ?

[2024-09-23T00:32:57] Smart Repair: 10.3 kW was the maximum. I'll try to beat it again in the next few days with more phase current and a shorter ramping time 🤪
[2024-09-23T00:34:43] Smart Repair: or is there another brake? and what about FW? Is 50A too much or can I go even higher. the acceleration from 65kmh decreases noticeably
[2024-09-23T00:36:10] Noname: That could be a v3 idk
[2024-09-23T00:36:15] Noname: Mines a v4
[2024-09-23T00:36:46] Yamal: Top speed ?

[2024-09-23T00:48:07] Finn: https://youtu.be/OUydUh7Vc9Q
[2024-09-23T00:50:57] Smart Repair: Is there a rough guideline as to how high you can set the fw? Would 80-100A be too much? Or just test and monitor the temperatures?
[2024-09-23T00:53:21] Smart Repair: exactly the opposite is the case... the higher the speed, the lower the power consumption
[2024-09-23T00:56:06] Smart Repair: my next engine will be the Balance version... currently without fw it stops at 65kmh
[2024-09-23T00:57:04] haku: my boy in the spectrum non of that needed imo. but some parents i cant blame. its diffucult. need to channel thier brain on what stimulates them. like my boy loves numbers and can do 2nd grade math. hes only kinder

The way im flabbergasted to see a guy who ig from america happily posting his red haired kit with a whippet in his hands and say its the fix for his issue show alot about the mindfucked ppl in your country
[2024-09-23T01:10:03] haku: we had those in the 90s

[2024-09-23T04:36:34] haku: has it been done with a ali nfc reader before?
[2024-09-23T04:43:58] haku: @jamessoderstrom for these laotie motors is it possible to remove the axle and switch the phase cables to the other side? idk why the design is like this. same side phase and rotor. china design
[2024-09-23T04:54:10] haku: who is this dude. stop trolling fellas.

[2024-09-23T08:48:09] GABE: good to know there are some cheaper alternatives

[2024-09-23T09:05:22] purp: do y’all ever use two different KV motors for the front and rear? maybe less slip on the front?
[2024-09-23T09:29:14] GABE: My Fiido motor is like that.

[2024-09-23T10:32:59] GABE: Does anyone know of a TO220 (MP2) 24s safe MOSFET that isnt 150v?
[2024-09-23T10:33:22] GABE: E.g a 120-125v MOSFET with high RDSON or whatever tf 120v being 26.6s peak voltage safe and anything over that is over 20% voltage leverage

[2024-09-23T11:43:10] Tobias Althaus: Hello @all and Hello James, I need to ask you something again 😬. I’m still stuck with the on/off button issue. Maybe you remember, you suggested connecting the keyswitch to 5 volts, but I didn’t fully understand why. Does the original power button send a 5-volt signal to the UBox, or does the UBox already provide 5 volts to the power button connection? Also, I’ve been having trouble finding an NC switch in the right size. Because the way you described it, it seems like I would have a constant 5-volt supply.

[2024-09-23T12:51:03] Tristan: My G4 was doing 90 without any problems. Since a small fall it's been wobbling stupidly.
[2024-09-23T12:52:13] Tristan: Above 60 it is unstable. According to Kukirin, there is a screw on the front of the steering head bearing to tighten it.
[2024-09-23T12:52:17] Patrick: Kukirin moment
[2024-09-23T12:53:05] Tristan: The G4 frame is great in terms of space
[2024-09-23T12:53:11] Tristan: Unfortunately steel frame
[2024-09-23T12:56:22] GABE: New cell and vesc I assume
[2024-09-23T12:56:28] GABE: What did it do 90 with
[2024-09-23T12:56:34] GABE: my customer wants his to go 90 and he's 90kg
[2024-09-23T12:57:18] GABE: I believe the motor can handle 90kmh wattage
[2024-09-23T12:58:19] Patrick: Tell youre customer to get a good frame please
[2024-09-23T12:59:43] Tristan: <video_file>

[2024-09-23T13:00:14] GABE: He wants acceleration. The frame will be fine, scooter won't be hyper.
[2024-09-23T13:00:22] GABE: Motor on rear so no stress on front .
[2024-09-23T13:00:43] Tristan: The stock motor is really crap
[2024-09-23T13:00:45] GABE: I just have to know what power with the stock motor achieved 90kmh
[2024-09-23T13:00:52] GABE: Did it heat?
[2024-09-23T13:00:53] Tristan: 8kw xD
[2024-09-23T13:01:01] Tristan: Oven
[2024-09-23T13:01:09] Tristan: Very hot
[2024-09-23T13:01:18] GABE: What did it take to reach 70 (stock) and 80
[2024-09-23T13:01:21] Tristan: Very inefficient
[2024-09-23T13:01:24] GABE: stock controler isnt smart
[2024-09-23T13:01:26] Patrick: More scared of wobbles i mean kukirins are known for this
[2024-09-23T13:01:33] Tristan: I really don't know
[2024-09-23T13:01:52] GABE: Do you know if it can be paired with another?
[2024-09-23T13:01:55] Tristan: But the frame and especially the suspension is awesome
[2024-09-23T13:01:56] GABE: What's the H count
[2024-09-23T13:02:04] Tristan: 50h
[2024-09-23T13:02:11] GABE: That's fineeeeeeeee
[2024-09-23T13:02:24] GABE: I'll tell him his only option is another 50h and 20s5/6p moli
[2024-09-23T13:02:28] GABE: He said he doesn't care how much it costs
[2024-09-23T13:02:38] GABE: I told him maybe 1000 and he was like sure whatever
[2024-09-23T13:02:50] Tristan: I wanted to combine it with a laotie motor
[2024-09-23T13:03:04] GABE: new 50h is what 150-250e
[2024-09-23T13:03:07] Tristan: But the motor sucks
[2024-09-23T13:03:14] GABE: 50h sucks.
[2024-09-23T13:03:23] GABE: as a whole unless there's two
[2024-09-23T13:03:27] GABE: Oh also is it 16x4?
[2024-09-23T13:03:45] Tristan: <photos/photo_17902@23-09-2024_13-03-45.jpg>

[2024-09-23T13:03:46] Tristan: <photos/photo_17904@23-09-2024_13-03-46.jpg>
[2024-09-23T13:03:48] Tristan: Laotie Motor
[2024-09-23T13:04:04] Tristan: After 8kw
[2024-09-23T13:04:12] Tristan: Phase short killed my 85150
[2024-09-23T13:04:24] Tristan: Idk
[2024-09-23T13:04:24] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Tristan has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-23T13:04:39] GABE: My 350w pushed 3500w and then shorted inside and the 80100 spintend didn't die
[2024-09-23T13:05:02] GABE: Said 3500 on app idk how.
[2024-09-23T13:05:06] GABE: must be wrong
[2024-09-23T13:05:38] GABE: I'll have to open his shit. The front suspension, it may need to be replaced with something beefier, shouldn't be impossible though, just metalwork shizzle. He said he's open to dual 60h power the frame is so good, just not the front suspension shit, As for the wobbles, there's a fix for that (rear suspension mods and stock front suspension elimination) . It's such a good frame. Steel sure but whatever, so is G2 frame.
[2024-09-23T13:34:29] Yamal: Very nice man , congratulations,, ⚡️vesc proyect always strong🔥❤️‍🔥
[2024-09-23T13:36:57] Yamal: G30?
[2024-09-23T13:38:30] GABE: Does anyone have a dual vsett with 50h, what power did you achieve? @Bradhaku
[2024-09-23T13:58:34] haku: i dont have a 50h vsett. i have a 30/35h vsett 9
[2024-09-23T14:01:45] haku: the rainbow led lightstrip
[2024-09-23T14:04:27] Tristan: Kukirin G4
[2024-09-23T14:04:33] Tristan: Thanks :)
[2024-09-23T14:05:34] Tristan: The frame offers so many possibilities for modification. It also looks very stable, except for the handlebars.
[2024-09-23T14:06:10] Tristan: You don't have to do much at the front to install a motor
[2024-09-23T14:06:48] Tristan: Space for battery is 18.5cm x 45cm big af
[2024-09-23T14:06:49] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Tristan has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-23T14:17:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It looks like the phases is rgb
[2024-09-23T14:20:25] GABE: Does the suspension like it?
[2024-09-23T14:20:48] GABE: I'm sure a 50/60h at peak power will bend it into a ball
[2024-09-23T15:01:21] Noname: You should stash them at my place
[2024-09-23T15:19:33] Yamal: welcome to autumn 🍂
[2024-09-23T16:02:33] haku: riding season now here
[2024-09-23T16:06:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is it ok to go with plastic as a temporary box for vesc ?(I'll put an alu plate in)
[2024-09-23T16:17:37] haku: sure if its temporary
[2024-09-23T16:26:05] Yamal: Maybe winter too,, No there are a lot of rain there,,?
[2024-09-23T16:50:17] Tristan: I actually planned to drive 10kw each front and rear
[2024-09-23T16:57:59] GABE: How were you not scared, youre in CEPP
[2024-09-23T17:01:31] GABE: What exactly
[2024-09-23T17:16:00] GABE: I remember my babies
[2024-09-23T17:16:05] GABE: They're gone 🥲
[2024-09-23T17:18:38] 'lekrsu': make moah babies
[2024-09-23T17:29:47] Yamal: You have before in some proyect or just the one you “lost”
[2024-09-23T17:30:46] Yamal: But is dual right now?
[2024-09-23T17:31:53] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is the kw in rt data real ?
[2024-09-23T17:32:30] Yamal: real as life itself
[2024-09-23T17:34:12] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So I'm pushing 8.5kw through a 1000w motors. ?
[2024-09-23T17:34:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: God have mercy on my motors
[2024-09-23T17:36:35] Yamal: Maybe he is single motor ? Don’t know really I don’t understand
[2024-09-23T17:38:03] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Me ? On dual so it's like 4.2kw per motor
[2024-09-23T17:38:22] Yamal: I mean Tristan
[2024-09-23T17:38:34] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What about a bag?
[2024-09-23T17:41:09] sombre_enfant: Same as vsett 10 then
[2024-09-23T17:43:04] sombre_enfant: I do
[2024-09-23T17:45:39] haku: idk man. rather have metal for esc metal cools down.
[2024-09-23T17:46:40] haku: not yet but weather is perfect. not jacket season yet but not too hot
[2024-09-23T17:47:47] haku: forget about those. let it go dude. learn from past mistakes. repent your sins and move on. be a new man.
[2024-09-23T17:48:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Have metall plate to esc to bag
[2024-09-23T17:48:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Alos I sent u DMS
[2024-09-23T17:49:20] haku: you can try if thats all you have for now. just monitor temps
[2024-09-23T17:49:59] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: (had it running naked with scotch tape to deck wasn't getting hot at all
[2024-09-23T18:17:17] haku: oh snap. Noname check this out.
[2024-09-23T18:17:18] haku: <photos/photo_17907@23-09-2024_18-17-18.jpg>
[2024-09-23T18:18:18] Noname: Min order 10. And send the fucking link damn it
[2024-09-23T18:18:52] haku: https://m.alibaba.com/x/Axb9BY?ck=pdp
[2024-09-23T18:20:38] haku: i want a sidecar for the minibike
[2024-09-23T18:24:00] Noname: https://www.facebook.com/share/r/HVYmDmJFEZ7SnRwn/?mibextid=D5vuiz
[2024-09-23T18:24:06] Noname: Temu is better lol
[2024-09-23T18:25:06] GABE: The 2 I lost
[2024-09-23T18:25:31] GABE: They were my first two ever
[2024-09-23T18:25:37] GABE: therefore sentimental value.
[2024-09-23T18:25:43] GABE: Can't be replaced.
[2024-09-23T18:33:43] haku: how much she didnt say. also thats bs she carried that to the car
[2024-09-23T18:35:15] haku: my sister said temu is actually good prices. im an ali boy.
[2024-09-23T18:35:51] haku: she got my boy some clothes there. quality is not bad
[2024-09-23T18:37:47] haku: i think thats a rebrand of the walmart tool set. i forgot the name. hart i think
[2024-09-23T18:53:26] GABE: This iss probably the original brand
[2024-09-23T18:53:28] GABE: Lol
[2024-09-23T18:53:54] haku: it might lol.
[2024-09-23T18:57:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_17908@23-09-2024_18-57-33.jpg>
[2024-09-23T19:03:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Enough for cooling? (Vesc still in his case )
[2024-09-23T19:04:48] haku: looks good how thick is it?
[2024-09-23T19:14:03] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Not much
[2024-09-23T19:14:31] haku: like atleast 1cm 2cm?
[2024-09-23T19:14:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_17909@23-09-2024_19-14-31.jpg>
[2024-09-23T19:14:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 0.5 haha
[2024-09-23T19:15:06] haku: thats thin my guy. it might work. im not sure
[2024-09-23T19:15:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I can cut in half and stack
[2024-09-23T19:15:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: To think that this is the size of the vesc
[2024-09-23T19:16:06] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_17910@23-09-2024_19-16-06.jpg>
[2024-09-23T19:16:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Can fit 84100 4 times there
[2024-09-23T19:16:26] haku: you want a thick alu block atleast. but if your setup right now is working well just do that
[2024-09-23T19:17:05] haku: im not pro. wait for vesclord advice
[2024-09-23T19:17:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: This is kinda of a stress run
[2024-09-23T19:18:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And that is naked vesc (but it shows me only one of them I think)(it's dual)
[2024-09-23T19:19:55] haku: temps look good to me. im not sure
[2024-09-23T19:27:36] Yamal: https://youtu.be/dSCBSCDgiFw?si=9f204HcH_hPFa7w8
[2024-09-23T19:40:14] haku: dam thats the same one i have. so gay i need bigger wheels
[2024-09-23T19:40:49] haku: thats the old version though
[2024-09-23T19:42:54] haku: woke NY police
[2024-09-23T19:45:04] Patrick: Measurements of the small Seven
[2024-09-23T19:50:44] Tristan: German mentality
[2024-09-23T19:51:30] Tristan: 2 cuts to fit the motor and holes for the safety nut
[2024-09-23T19:51:39] Tristan: I would try it with a cnc
[2024-09-23T19:52:17] Tristan: My G4 is single drive in this vid
[2024-09-23T19:52:44] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-09-23T19:52:59] Tristan: Was supposed to be dual but I blew everything up before xD
[2024-09-23T19:53:16] Tristan: Ubox dead, both motors dead.
[2024-09-23T19:54:42] Tristan: <photos/photo_17912@23-09-2024_19-54-42.jpg>
[2024-09-23T19:54:42] Tristan: <photos/photo_17913@23-09-2024_19-54-42.jpg>
[2024-09-23T19:55:50] Yamal: amazing
[2024-09-23T19:55:57] Tristan: This is the new 70H ly motor that will go in a g30
[2024-09-23T19:55:57] Yamal: Of course 22/3,,?
[2024-09-23T19:56:07] Tristan: Yeah
[2024-09-23T19:56:58] Tristan: My G4 has been standing around for months, actually too bad for the beautiful frame
[2024-09-23T19:57:03] haku: wow. how will it fit?
[2024-09-23T19:57:22] Rose: Hey there LUIS CARLOS, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-09-23T19:57:23] Tristan: Custom rear Suspension
[2024-09-23T19:57:49] Tristan: And the new speedforks
[2024-09-23T19:58:26] Yamal: But now I thinking g4 is 10” stock
[2024-09-23T19:58:30] haku: been waiting for someone other than the one french guy to do this
[2024-09-23T19:58:38] Tristan: Its 11"
[2024-09-23T19:58:43] Tristan: 90/65
[2024-09-23T19:59:22] haku: front and rear 70h? 40pl battery and what vesc?
[2024-09-23T19:59:31] Tristan: We are trying to design something with adjustable dropout
[2024-09-23T19:59:51] Tristan: 20s8p Samsung 50S 360A peak
[2024-09-23T20:00:09] haku: ok
[2024-09-23T20:00:24] Tristan: But with the ubox 85150
[2024-09-23T20:00:40] Tristan: So the full power will not be usable
[2024-09-23T20:01:17] haku: everything needs balance. battery esc motor.
[2024-09-23T20:01:45] haku: power has to match or you dont get your moneys worth
[2024-09-23T20:03:10] haku: i learned that from the vesc lords
[2024-09-23T20:03:53] Yamal: Once again Ubox surprises! Filing out reports and collecting taxes
[2024-09-23T20:05:09] haku: lol. what does that mean. haha
[2024-09-23T20:06:05] haku: lets go back to offtopic where we belong yamal
[2024-09-23T20:06:22] Yamal: 😂
[2024-09-23T20:07:12] Yamal: Later I tell you I need to move ,, soon everything clouse… 🔙offtopic
[2024-09-23T20:08:09] Tristan: More possible amps prevent voltage drop
[2024-09-23T20:08:53] Tristan: I will only drive with the max 20kw until it gets boring xD
[2024-09-23T20:09:22] Tristan: I hope it will last long
[2024-09-23T20:12:01] haku: 6 fet spintend can do 20kw? wow
[2024-09-23T20:12:59] haku: dang thats crazy
[2024-09-23T20:13:23] haku: my sons bike can do 10kw then with the proper setup
[2024-09-23T20:14:42] haku: shouldve used a makerbase on his bike and kept spintend for myself
[2024-09-23T20:15:23] Tristan: The ubox 85150 is simply mega price-performance
[2024-09-23T20:16:08] haku: true. maybe get mini spintend
[2024-09-23T20:16:12] Tristan: My electronics instructor couldn't believe that the little thing could handle so much
[2024-09-23T20:16:31] Tristan: Even when I proved it
[2024-09-23T20:16:47] Tristan: He is a little older
[2024-09-23T20:17:20] Tristan: I want to show him the tronic x12, then he falls over
[2024-09-23T20:18:12] Tristan: He said it just doesn't work. He said that with a 150A battery the cables melt xD
[2024-09-23T20:18:52] Tristan: He says I should talk to him again in 4 weeks when I have learned more xD
[2024-09-23T20:19:03] Tristan: Yes!
[2024-09-23T20:19:16] Patrick: Seven*
[2024-09-23T20:19:19] Patrick: 30 fets
[2024-09-23T20:19:43] haku: with ly phase cables what is the max legnth on those to still have good resistance?
[2024-09-23T20:19:45] Tristan: We mainly work with high voltages above 11kV and there is hardly any current flowing
[2024-09-23T20:20:07] Tristan: So he probably has little idea
[2024-09-23T20:20:31] Patrick: Bad teacher = good teacher
[2024-09-23T20:20:37] Tristan: Then he gets a heart attack. On iphone size 80kw xD
[2024-09-23T20:20:51] Tristan: Actually, he is quite good
[2024-09-23T20:22:01] Tristan: In Germany everything is calculated with a huge buffer
[2024-09-23T20:22:24] Tristan: That's why 6mm² is probably unthinkable with 200A
[2024-09-23T20:22:29] Yamal: <photos/photo_17914@23-09-2024_20-22-29.jpg>
[2024-09-23T20:22:32] Tristan: Yeah
[2024-09-23T20:23:25] haku: dang i like that wood grain.
[2024-09-23T20:23:29] Tristan: Specific resistance (copper=0.0173) x length in meters : circular area in mm²
[2024-09-23T20:23:31] haku: you got class boy
[2024-09-23T20:23:38] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-09-23T20:24:58] haku: i want maple burl on the sides on mine or stainless sheet
[2024-09-23T20:25:42] Tristan: <photos/photo_17915@23-09-2024_20-25-42.jpg>
[2024-09-23T20:26:05] Tristan: He taught me xD
[2024-09-23T20:26:25] Tristan: Long time xD
[2024-09-23T20:27:55] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What first metall or thermall ?
[2024-09-23T20:28:21] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_17916@23-09-2024_20-28-21.jpg>
[2024-09-23T20:28:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_17917@23-09-2024_20-28-36.jpg>
[2024-09-23T20:30:23] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like this ?
[2024-09-23T20:30:30] Tristan: If I have calculated correctly, that is only 6.3 watts of heat at 150A
[2024-09-23T20:30:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Or
[2024-09-23T20:32:57] Tristan: The cable has a resistance of 0.000285 Ohm
[2024-09-23T20:33:45] Tristan: 150² x 0.000285 = 6.3W
[2024-09-23T20:34:25] Tristan: It's not perfect, but it should be about right
[2024-09-23T20:35:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ok
[2024-09-23T20:36:29] Tristan: Of course, you shouldn't forget the heat from the controller, but it shouldn't get hotter than 70c
[2024-09-23T20:36:58] Tristan: Dont forget, its just peak
[2024-09-23T20:37:08] Tristan: Not continues
[2024-09-23T20:37:28] Tristan: So it should be easy
[2024-09-23T20:37:49] Tristan: Or did i forget any factors?
[2024-09-23T20:38:10] Tristan: The xt90 could get hot
[2024-09-23T20:38:37] Tristan: How much resistance does it have? I'll take a quick look
[2024-09-23T20:40:05] Tristan: Is probably far too inaccurate due to the many other factors
[2024-09-23T20:40:40] Tristan: 6² x 100
[2024-09-23T20:41:19] Tristan: 600mm³ of copper
[2024-09-23T20:42:22] haku: dude you really need a thicker aluminum
[2024-09-23T20:43:19] haku: also metal enclosure to absorb heat and cool off
[2024-09-23T20:44:03] haku: @punedir where did you placed vescs on zero?
[2024-09-23T20:47:39] puneDir: Bag
[2024-09-23T20:47:55] haku: does it get hot?
[2024-09-23T20:48:05] puneDir: Didnt tried yet
[2024-09-23T20:48:12] puneDir: Theyre mounted on steel plate
[2024-09-23T20:49:01] haku: whats better to absorb heat? steel or aluminum or copper?
[2024-09-23T20:49:18] puneDir: Idk
[2024-09-23T20:49:28] puneDir: I just have that in hand
[2024-09-23T20:49:43] puneDir: I want 125cc bike

[2024-09-24T02:59:58] haku: atleast 1cm or 2

[2024-09-24T03:42:28] Noname: Higher voltage travels easier
[2024-09-24T03:43:00] haku: not even sweaty hands. just touching the copper ends
[2024-09-24T03:43:00] 'lekrsu': my 72v battery made tingles with dry hands
[2024-09-24T03:43:29] Noname: Accidently leaned on a 14s and got it through elbow

[2024-09-24T03:46:41] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2024-09-24T03:46:51] haku: how can you tell the difference between 220 and 110 outlet in the US. 3 holes vs 2?

[2024-09-24T03:47:41] 'lekrsu': the transformer on your elec poles give 220 via two phases
[2024-09-24T03:47:55] 'lekrsu': rarely 3 phase in us
[2024-09-24T03:48:03] Noname: Not a house

[2024-09-24T03:48:59] 'lekrsu': having elec poles & wires in the air is strange heh
[2024-09-24T03:49:19] 'lekrsu': transformer on the ends to houses for extra fluff

[2024-09-24T04:18:22] FreehandZ: Copper has the highest thermal conductivity
[2024-09-24T04:20:26] 'lekrsu': make sure it doesn't touch directly

[2024-09-25T00:20:59] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Vesc still running yes
[2024-09-25T00:21:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But don't have time to re wire throttle back to vesc it's 1.20am
[2024-09-25T00:21:30] haku: it was gifted from the heavens above. waiting for mans creativity
[2024-09-25T00:21:40] Andrei Albert: One brake away from heaven
[2024-09-25T00:22:22] haku: elon and trump endorsed g30
[2024-09-25T00:23:31] Yamal: I need to change the disc brakes
[2024-09-25T00:23:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Don't remember left the vesc room (but it should light up at least and it doesn't)
[2024-09-25T00:23:35] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: .
[2024-09-25T00:23:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Even after wiring correct
[2024-09-25T00:24:12] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: (with throttle connected to vesc ?)
[2024-09-25T00:27:07] haku: what is it normally?
[2024-09-25T00:28:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like 1.2 or something
[2024-09-25T00:29:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Not 0 not 3.2 not responding to throttle also if no light no work I think
[2024-09-25T00:29:06] Rose: Hey there Isabel, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-09-25T00:31:27] Isabel Sánchez: Hi group, can U recommend me a scooter to me. I just got my car license and I want one to move into the city
[2024-09-25T00:33:41] haku: g30
[2024-09-25T00:40:42] Yamal: https://youtu.be/G75JrPLKiAY?si=v6GA6xGqLXliULv-
[2024-09-25T00:44:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: All of this for breake lights ? Sometimes vesc is too complicated
[2024-09-25T00:46:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes look at their vids of the thing
[2024-09-25T00:47:03] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'll check that tomorrow
[2024-09-25T00:48:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But I do remember it not lighting up even when connected 12
[2024-09-25T03:31:52] haku: chingalo.
[2024-09-25T03:31:52] haku: <photos/photo_17946@25-09-2024_03-31-52.jpg>
[2024-09-25T03:51:05] haku: this new teslas look nice.
[2024-09-25T05:49:11] haku: its like i soldered that haha
[2024-09-25T06:09:27] Noname: Mistyped Gheey 😆
[2024-09-25T08:16:29] Yamal: hey good morning, do you have torque? I'm observing and I must have something wrong in my programming, because the e-scooter was really weak apart from being below 3kw in normal use, although later 6kw was registered in the app, I realize compared to yours, that something I'm missing in the programming...
[2024-09-25T08:18:09] Yamal: I remember that I changed all the parameters of the engine to what it already had before updating the firmware, perhaps this is the error, something else, my engine at start with a bit of a slope stays dead, it has a hard time starting...
[2024-09-25T08:21:03] puneDir: Normal
[2024-09-25T08:21:19] puneDir: Sucks
[2024-09-25T08:21:33] puneDir: But all of my 84100s were stm
[2024-09-25T08:22:00] puneDir: Guys how can i cool vescs in bag
[2024-09-25T08:46:16] Yamal: Maybe it is better not to touch these parameters after doing motor detection,?
[2024-09-25T09:07:03] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I have your parameters saved
[2024-09-25T09:07:22] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Son estos
[2024-09-25T09:07:25] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 24,1 48,93 10,67 10,467 0.0489 24,11 9,11
[2024-09-25T09:10:09] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: This is from when I asked you for them
[2024-09-25T09:24:54] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes but not going up
[2024-09-25T09:25:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Fans
[2024-09-25T10:05:02] Jan: Dont fans
[2024-09-25T10:15:25] Mihail: Any idea what the current limit is on Vsett 10+ battery? Mine appears to have no limit for whatever reason, but I've seen someone mention someting like 80A. I use 100-110A from my battery and have never had it cut, so I wonder if there is a limit.
[2024-09-25T10:22:25] NetworkDir: what version do you have
[2024-09-25T10:22:41] NetworkDir: 20.8Ah 60V CN cells?
[2024-09-25T10:23:45] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_17948@25-09-2024_10-23-45.jpg>
[2024-09-25T10:24:20] Mihail: I think so
[2024-09-25T10:26:55] NetworkDir: they use 2600mAh dynavolt or another noname 2600mAh 3C cells 16s8p setup you can get continuous 60A but on peak better use 80-90A for better cell life.
[2024-09-25T10:27:23] NetworkDir: also bms prob 60A cont but can give peak 100A
[2024-09-25T10:36:15] Tristan: The original G4 motor hardly has any torque anyway. Unfortunately I no longer have my old parameters and I'm on the road right now. I'll get back to you later.
[2024-09-25T11:08:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Any other idea ?
[2024-09-25T11:22:28] Yamal: I mean the ly 22/3 you have now
[2024-09-25T11:22:42] Yamal: Becaouse I’m 60h22/3
[2024-09-25T11:51:01] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/BPOAbsudM1c?si=1sEH-WZzfvhDbRH2
[2024-09-25T12:07:34] puneDir: Any other idea? I dont have any solution instead of putting escs in bag
[2024-09-25T12:21:14] Jan: Replace bag backside with a 5mm finned alu plate
[2024-09-25T12:21:49] Jan: But dont bag mount esc if possible
[2024-09-25T13:05:19] GABE: Do you mean with the stock controller, that's like 30a
[2024-09-25T13:30:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I did think about bags also but Ive gon with this even though it came out ugly
[2024-09-25T13:30:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_17937@24-09-2024_22-18-22.jpg>

[2024-09-25T13:31:05] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'll wrap it In carbon
[2024-09-25T13:32:07] puneDir: Looks good
[2024-09-25T13:58:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes but not water tight (nothing currently is water tight maybe the motors)
[2024-09-25T13:58:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Thank you 🙏
[2024-09-25T14:12:17] Tristan: Stock controller is 40A
[2024-09-25T14:12:25] Tristan: I mean with 8kw
[2024-09-25T14:12:46] Tristan: I never plugged it in yet xD
[2024-09-25T14:16:36] GABE: How often does one scratch the bottom plate on a 6p G30?
[2024-09-25T14:16:45] GABE: Is it really that annoying?
[2024-09-25T14:17:18] GABE: it's 16s
[2024-09-25T14:17:24] Tristan: Yes
[2024-09-25T14:17:42] Tristan: <video_file>
[2024-09-25T14:17:55] Tristan: The stock controller says 40A
[2024-09-25T14:17:55] GABE: esc can't acc be 140a
[2024-09-25T14:18:01] GABE: for 8kw
[2024-09-25T14:18:05] GABE: it's 16s at 56v
[2024-09-25T14:18:18] puneDir: Is 50a fwk dangerous?
[2024-09-25T14:18:48] Tristan: I pushed 8kw with my 20s8p
[2024-09-25T14:18:52] Tristan: Not stock battery
[2024-09-25T14:19:20] Tristan: Stock battery can push 70A without problems
[2024-09-25T14:19:28] Tristan: They use EVE 26V
[2024-09-25T14:20:07] GABE: Ah on that motor
[2024-09-25T14:20:07] GABE: how much do you weigh lo
[2024-09-25T14:20:16] Tristan: 80kgs
[2024-09-25T14:20:46] Tristan: Stock Motor
[2024-09-25T14:30:52] Yamal: Pretty nice man⚡️🔥
[2024-09-25T14:38:06] Yamal: 2 stock motor 16kw
[2024-09-25T14:42:42] Jason: ehehehehe
[2024-09-25T14:42:44] GABE: Pretty much with less heat
[2024-09-25T14:43:00] Jason: bone stock snsc 2.3
[2024-09-25T14:43:53] Jason: depends on motor but usually high current with fwk = coil burner
[2024-09-25T14:45:38] Jan: <photos/photo_17952@25-09-2024_14-45-38.jpg>
[2024-09-25T14:45:50] Jan: You need to be aware of what you can and what not
[2024-09-25T14:46:30] Jan: Then its alright, but ground clearance is an inconvenience
[2024-09-25T14:54:57] GABE: Needa power wash those fins
[2024-09-25T14:55:16] GABE: That'll be easy I think, clearance on my 20s pro 2 was the same.
[2024-09-25T14:55:24] GABE: used to it.
[2024-09-25T14:55:47] GABE: those fins seem like they'll cause a full on crash if you get stuck on them
[2024-09-25T14:57:07] Jan: I have a skirt for it, too lazy to mount
[2024-09-25T15:05:43] Yamal: WAYOOOOOOOO 🤩
[2024-09-25T15:09:21] Jason: also beans compartment works
[2024-09-25T15:09:26] Jason: <video_file>
[2024-09-25T15:09:31] Jason: <sticker>
[2024-09-25T15:24:20] Tristan: Wait until the G2 speedfork comes, should also fit the snsc
[2024-09-25T15:29:10] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm on 60
[2024-09-25T15:30:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But with 80a phase

[2024-09-25T15:40:49] puneDir: Welding the second layer
[2024-09-25T16:09:42] GABE: This will handle how much amps?
[2024-09-25T16:17:59] Yamal: It looks like a racing g30, and the way it behaves
[2024-09-25T16:20:53] Yamal: 🤙
[2024-09-25T16:29:59] Yamal: It is funny and at the same time surprising that a g30 devours all the high-end e-scooters and hyperscooters on the market
[2024-09-25T16:32:37] Yamal: not only in terms of power but also stability and performance, it is the scooter balance that everyone wants to find😂💃🪩
[2024-09-25T16:40:39] GABE: itll never stop being funny
[2024-09-25T16:42:16] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/DrszY37ajis?si=AfD1GdlGxXmQXgAl
[2024-09-25T16:42:30] Yamal: vesc and beach, nothing more is needed
[2024-09-25T16:43:23] Yamal: ¿G30/30kg/30kw?
[2024-09-25T16:43:41] GABE: the fact that g30s outperform any commercial high powered scooter.
[2024-09-25T16:43:49] GABE: at 6p.
[2024-09-25T16:44:02] GABE: as you said a second ago
[2024-09-25T16:44:36] Yamal: Yes but I mean is true?
[2024-09-25T16:44:53] Yamal: Is around 30kg and 30kw? Or more ,,?
[2024-09-25T16:45:06] GABE: idk the 6p g30s have 20kw at like 7.5kg cell and 20kg other shit
[2024-09-25T16:45:12] GABE: so prob 30kg 20kw sure on them
[2024-09-25T16:45:23] GABE: nvm forgot motors
[2024-09-25T16:45:25] Yamal: More than 20 man
[2024-09-25T16:45:25] GABE: they weigh
[2024-09-25T16:45:40] GABE: Groups g30s have 6p no more than 20kw therefore
[2024-09-25T16:45:44] GABE: at around 35kg maybe
[2024-09-25T16:45:48] Yamal: 20 kw with 700A ?
[2024-09-25T16:46:00] GABE: Whose has 700a batt
[2024-09-25T16:46:08] GABE: 6p x 45
[2024-09-25T16:46:10] Yamal: Phase ..
[2024-09-25T16:46:23] Yamal: Battery maybe 300
[2024-09-25T16:46:49] GABE: 1;1 power ac to dc means that itll never surpass 20kw
[2024-09-25T16:46:54] GABE: at 6p
[2024-09-25T16:47:13] GABE: cos it can be 700a phase and 40% batt voltage
[2024-09-25T16:47:15] GABE: for example
[2024-09-25T16:47:27] GABE: or 72v phase 300a phase
[2024-09-25T16:47:28] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-25T16:47:52] Yamal: I can see por than 20kw on this g30 irish man
[2024-09-25T16:49:27] Yamal: That scooter arrived in Switzerland on Elon's space x,They found it orbiting I think...
[2024-09-25T16:49:43] GABE: you mean on mine? Motors will be capped.
[2024-09-25T16:49:59] GABE: 60h about 10kw each with dual so with 70h assume 70/60 vol x 10kw =
[2024-09-25T16:50:29] GABE: 12000w / motor 24000w cap.
[2024-09-25T16:50:54] Yamal: I mean jrev performance scooter
[2024-09-25T16:51:04] GABE: the jrev was 7p
[2024-09-25T16:51:07] GABE: iirc isomeone said
[2024-09-25T16:51:13] GABE: ''7p or never 20kw'' apparently
[2024-09-25T16:51:38] GABE: cells cant do more
[2024-09-25T16:52:08] GABE: Zunas has 9p sure, and motors are still capped at 20kw or so, so he has extra KWH
[2024-09-25T16:52:08] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-25T16:56:09] Jan: It has always been 6p
[2024-09-25T16:56:18] GABE: i swore i heard someone say that
[2024-09-25T16:56:42] GABE: damn
[2024-09-25T16:56:52] Jan: I have seen so.many untrue fact about my scooter online its funny 😅
[2024-09-25T16:57:06] Jan: Like tiktok comments etc
[2024-09-25T16:57:07] GABE: are you inventor of the g30 schematic?
[2024-09-25T16:57:14] Jan: Which one?
[2024-09-25T16:57:14] GABE: or was zuna first
[2024-09-25T16:57:16] GABE: who was first
[2024-09-25T16:57:19] GABE: the 6p
[2024-09-25T16:57:24] GABE: 20kw g30
[2024-09-25T16:57:49] Jan: I was informed a 6p would fit
[2024-09-25T16:58:51] Jan: <photos/photo_17956@25-09-2024_16-58-51.jpg>
[2024-09-25T16:59:11] Jan: This layout how to place controllers and bms for g30 i did
[2024-09-25T16:59:14] GABE: whats the arduino for again
[2024-09-25T16:59:16] GABE: heat??
[2024-09-25T16:59:24] Jan: Light electronics
[2024-09-25T16:59:54] Yamal: Never know too when I see this picture
[2024-09-25T17:00:03] Yamal: Sound like “aladin”
[2024-09-25T17:00:23] Yamal: Peak watts you can get ,,?
[2024-09-25T17:00:38] Jan: <photos/photo_17957@25-09-2024_17-00-38.jpg>
[2024-09-25T17:01:05] Yamal: Always I read like 30/35kw
[2024-09-25T17:01:09] Jan: LEDs are directly driven from the vesc
[2024-09-25T17:01:24] Jan: No, like 3-5W per led ring
[2024-09-25T17:01:35] Jan: Its already brighter than any stock light
[2024-09-25T17:01:45] Yamal: I mean POWER
[2024-09-25T17:02:00] Jan: Of scooter?
[2024-09-25T17:02:48] Jan: On the current setup P42a 20S6P 550A peak bms 2x 85250 2x 65H 33x2 About 21kW Battery limited
[2024-09-25T17:04:32] Jan: If i just change cells to 40PL, depending if you believe they can do max 60A => 26kW 70A => 30kW 80A => 34kW Without changing anything else. However i would need better cables than the stock ones
[2024-09-25T17:05:14] Patrick: 100A work too on the 40PL for some sec
[2024-09-25T17:05:39] Jan: Yeah but my BMS would probably blow ^^
[2024-09-25T17:05:58] GABE: can 48 cells fit in a 2L?
[2024-09-25T17:05:59] Patrick: Ah yes the Ant 550A right?
[2024-09-25T17:06:00] GABE: 2170
[2024-09-25T17:06:22] Jan: 85250 i dont know if they like 300A bat either, i think 200-250A battery should be top
[2024-09-25T17:06:26] Patrick: Oh yea peak little low i look at the ANT 850A right now it would fit with 2 seven controllers
[2024-09-25T17:06:39] GABE: batt limited? THATS 10.5kw / motor 65h....
[2024-09-25T17:06:49] GABE: no way they dont heat no?
[2024-09-25T17:06:53] GABE: especially 33x2
[2024-09-25T17:07:25] Jan: You cannot just magnet size, it max magnet flux and winding
[2024-09-25T17:07:28] Patrick: Small peak😭
[2024-09-25T17:07:36] Jan: @jamessoderstrom knows better
[2024-09-25T17:08:15] GABE: is ntc3000 the thing for motors
[2024-09-25T17:08:17] GABE: or nct10000
[2024-09-25T17:08:22] Jan: The thing is with the heat is a bit weird to see. High KV motors need more current yes, but they have lower resistance too
[2024-09-25T17:08:27] Patrick: 10k and 100k
[2024-09-25T17:08:31] Patrick: 10k mostly
[2024-09-25T17:08:38] Jan: I got 6-7mOhm, show me another motor that has this with phase cables
[2024-09-25T17:08:41] GABE: need or want more current.
[2024-09-25T17:08:43] GABE: big difference
[2024-09-25T17:08:49] Jan: Needs
[2024-09-25T17:08:59] Patrick: Phase cables crying
[2024-09-25T17:09:11] GABE: but more heat unwillingly
[2024-09-25T17:09:12] Jan: They dont like it
[2024-09-25T17:09:13] GABE: Correct?
[2024-09-25T17:09:15] GABE: Ah

[2024-09-25T17:09:27] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-25T17:09:30] Patrick: I hope these 6mm² high temp cables fit it would be amazing for the motor
[2024-09-25T17:09:47] Jan: They run way more efficient at higher speeds than low kv
[2024-09-25T17:09:58] Jan: But on low speeds they kinda suck
[2024-09-25T17:10:21] Jan: Mine at 20kmh work perfectly fine but will stabilize at 50°C after an hour riding
[2024-09-25T17:10:42] Jan: Yes, lots of work to pull the motor apart and redo phase
[2024-09-25T17:11:06] Patrick: Yea i hope it fits need to check the outer diameter of the cable but takes nearly 2 months for them to arrive
[2024-09-25T17:11:39] GABE: meaning normal speeds
[2024-09-25T17:11:57] GABE: its disgusting how much misc costs
[2024-09-25T17:12:14] GABE: Like i forget the hidden costs of miscellaneous BS half the time
[2024-09-25T17:13:17] Jan: But for topspeed anything else sucks ass
[2024-09-25T17:13:43] GABE: we are highway illegal most places anyway
[2024-09-25T17:13:45] GABE: even germany right

[2024-09-25T19:42:54] GABE: Looks like they adapt to the motor itself

[2024-09-25T20:30:14] haku: it may or may not

[2024-09-25T22:56:17] Andrei Albert: A little messy but nice one
[2024-09-25T22:56:33] haku: i wonder if fardriver works well with ly motors. not that i will buy it. just wondering
[2024-09-25T22:56:50] Yamal: Also good Man, ! This man make my battery
[2024-09-25T22:57:34] Andrei Albert: U know him? Wanted to ask him if he vibropolished his parts

[2024-09-25T22:58:17] Yamal: The man do this scooter yes, also he make very well carbon fiber
[2024-09-25T22:59:01] Andrei Albert: It should work fine. One thing i hate about theese motors its the paint man, very low quality
[2024-09-25T22:59:38] Andrei Albert: I saw his footrest, very nive
[2024-09-25T22:59:42] Andrei Albert: Nice
[2024-09-25T22:59:50] haku: yea the paint sucks
[2024-09-25T23:00:10] haku: it scratches easy
[2024-09-25T23:01:08] haku: just paint the rim
[2024-09-25T23:03:04] haku: why do people put holes in ly motors? is it that bad it overheats?
[2024-09-25T23:04:28] Yamal: I would say that only those who compete do it, to dissipate heat.
[2024-09-25T23:05:04] haku: to bad LY is the only good scooter motor manufacturer
[2024-09-25T23:05:26] haku: this needs a competition
[2024-09-25T23:06:16] Yamal: I can't wait to get my LY motor
[2024-09-25T23:06:39] haku: arent you using one already?
[2024-09-25T23:07:12] haku: the one you have with the holes is ly isnt it?
[2024-09-25T23:08:04] Yamal: Ly but not new generation with pretty phases etc etc etc
[2024-09-25T23:08:40] haku: its just the phases and the tubeless split rim yea? stator still the same
[2024-09-25T23:09:27] Yamal: Maybe I don’t know,, Paolo know xD

[2024-09-25T23:09:51] haku: i want qs motor or ym om my next project.
[2024-09-25T23:11:55] Yamal: The good thing about these motors is that I suppose you can put 1000A into them without any problem, right?
[2024-09-25T23:12:22] haku: qs? and ym? yes
[2024-09-25T23:12:31] haku: depends on the kind
[2024-09-25T23:13:20] haku: big fat stators. chonky boys
[2024-09-25T23:22:10] Yamal: https://youtu.be/rhOBDrr6nWc?si=yEFkOTr3RnAOWSpL
[2024-09-25T23:24:45] haku: thailand have alot of ladyboys that will headkick you then steal your scooter ive heard
[2024-09-25T23:25:34] haku: pdiddy favorite spot i hear
[2024-09-25T23:26:56] Yamal: True
[2024-09-25T23:27:09] haku: he said it in mark 3.24 he said p diddy
[2024-09-25T23:34:58] haku: @jamaludin_algarnati is your plants all organic? or you inject it with stuff?
[2024-09-25T23:38:11] Yamal: They are organic, I just add water.
[2024-09-25T23:38:25] haku: no pesticides?
[2024-09-25T23:38:40] GABE: Na, Nickel strip under nickel plate
[2024-09-25T23:38:40] haku: and fertilizer?
[2024-09-25T23:39:03] Andrei Albert: U grow vegetables?
[2024-09-25T23:39:31] GABE: Physically true, it mimics estrogen. perhaps not make men turn into women but makes you prone to man boobs.
[2024-09-25T23:40:00] Yamal: Nothing
[2024-09-25T23:40:09] Yamal: For home yes
[2024-09-25T23:40:35] haku: living of the land. what a real G
[2024-09-25T23:41:08] Andrei Albert: My parents are farmes haha
[2024-09-25T23:41:43] haku: i need to learn this. everything i plant dies
[2024-09-25T23:42:20] haku: need to get ready for the end of days
[2024-09-25T23:42:34] GABE: It may also technically change emotion.
[2024-09-25T23:42:43] GABE: Hormone swaying etc.
[2024-09-25T23:42:50] Yamal: the garden and the farmyard animals are the best
[2024-09-25T23:43:06] GABE: I avoid plastic as much as I can.
[2024-09-25T23:43:07] haku: american people eat a credit card worth of microplastics a year.
[2024-09-25T23:43:18] GABE: It's more and it's everywhere
[2024-09-25T23:43:33] GABE: biggest culprit is the toothbrushes.
[2024-09-25T23:43:37] GABE: not water bottle shizzle
[2024-09-25T23:43:45] GABE: Literal bioweapon
[2024-09-25T23:44:29] haku: i dont really care but it turns our children to autistics though. it just depends if your kid is a smart autistic or the noisy ones
[2024-09-25T23:44:29] Andrei Albert: Yeaaaaa
[2024-09-25T23:44:33] GABE: "Yes civilian just mesh microplastics into your mouth and then whine about it being in food"
[2024-09-25T23:44:58] GABE: I think bad upbringing causes autism in kids who had such a small percentage of the gene, that it wouldn't have happened.
[2024-09-25T23:45:23] GABE: Or exasberates it.
[2024-09-25T23:45:43] Yamal: The good thing is that your wife likes this, and the truth is that most people prefer a modern apartment.
[2024-09-25T23:45:53] haku: i dont think so. ive noticed my son was already in the spectrum at 2. he could read wich is crazy.
[2024-09-25T23:46:18] haku: hes the smart spectrum kind
[2024-09-25T23:46:25] GABE: Keep him raised right, unsheltered, and allowed to voice his opinion, and his autism wont slow him down at all.
[2024-09-25T23:46:29] haku: like elon
[2024-09-25T23:46:48] GABE: Crucial to keep him in areas with children so he doesn't lose the flame
[2024-09-25T23:47:18] Andrei Albert: I dont have a wife haha but i do live in an apartment and regularly go to my parents to get some healthy stuff
[2024-09-25T23:48:40] Yamal: I speak in general hehe
[2024-09-25T23:48:52] 'lekrsu': our wife
[2024-09-25T23:51:06] Andrei Albert: My wife should be cooking and housekeeping better than me, then shell be worthy of me😆😆
[2024-09-25T23:51:17] Yamal: It's time for a modern city for a month soon
[2024-09-25T23:51:36] haku: https://youtube.com/shorts/KzPtmB9JiWQ?si=lVz5ZfF8hWk33Rl6 what an idiot this guy
[2024-09-25T23:51:37] Yamal: 😂🤙
[2024-09-25T23:52:29] haku: both car and scooter bad driver
[2024-09-25T23:53:11] Yamal: But the man is like Bruce Lee
[2024-09-25T23:53:21] Yamal: Nothing happens
[2024-09-25T23:53:26] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-09-25T23:54:02] haku: why dont they ride with traffic?
[2024-09-25T23:57:25] luffydnoob: How good is this motor vs dualtron victor factory motor https://lonnyomotor.com/product/10-inch-fast-scooter-hub-motor-60-120v-thin-tire-1000-3500w/
[2024-09-25T23:58:10] haku: thats the best 10" i think
[2024-09-25T23:58:59] luffydnoob: What speed can I achieve with this one ?
[2024-09-25T23:59:14] luffydnoob: Same configuration
[2024-09-25T23:59:34] haku: no clue. but fast with the right setup. g30 guys use this motor for upgrades
[2024-09-25T23:59:46] luffydnoob: 16s 60a controller 30a each
[2024-09-26T00:00:42] haku: no idea. you need more i think
[2024-09-26T00:04:46] haku: motors should be the last to upgrade imo. battery and esc first. your stock motor can do more
[2024-09-26T01:14:35] GABE: 0kmh
[2024-09-26T02:13:22] luffydnoob: What do you mean
[2024-09-26T03:16:47] haku: finished the wiring. finally. i am sad knowing i need to take apart this pack someday.
[2024-09-26T03:17:14] haku: years worth of my time spent into making this art. thanks @jamessoderstrom for the holders
[2024-09-26T03:18:28] haku: it took a year of my personal life just to make this and knowing children somewhere having thier dicks and tits cut.
[2024-09-26T03:20:33] haku: im sorry i coudve chose to save the children
[2024-09-26T03:24:40] Noname: The end has come. It was a good ride but we must part ways. So long Lil buddy you will be missed
[2024-09-26T03:25:29] haku: haha
[2024-09-26T03:49:00] haku: should i wire up vesc first or build the p42 pack while waiting for china to ship parts qs8 and bag
[2024-09-26T03:49:57] Noname: Both
[2024-09-26T03:50:48] Noname: You ride on one batt and you won't finish 2nd. You build 2nd we're dead before test ride 🤷‍♂️
[2024-09-26T03:51:44] haku: i only have 1 brake right now and still waiting on lock washers. need to be secure before test
[2024-09-26T03:52:00] Noname: Regen baby like 100a
[2024-09-26T03:52:06] Noname: No brakes needed
[2024-09-26T03:52:42] Noname: Vsett comes to a halt but like the last 3 ft it just rolls
[2024-09-26T03:52:45] haku: whats a good regen /ebrake for 85/250. how much amps
[2024-09-26T03:52:55] Noname: Think Mines 90
[2024-09-26T04:39:13] haku: wrapping fail.
[2024-09-26T04:39:28] haku: ill just tape over it. would that be okay?
[2024-09-26T04:41:01] haku: i use fiber tape now. its pretty sealed
[2024-09-26T04:59:40] Noname: Agh sketch wrap that thing like a burrito.
[2024-09-26T05:00:30] haku: im still missing 1 qs8. to make extension cables. so it will be a while maybe 2 weeks till i get it running
[2024-09-26T05:00:50] Noname: Trusting tape and micron thin pvc not to rub a hole and explode
[2024-09-26T05:01:59] Noname: Let's Venmo .05$ for a qs8 from hobby store
[2024-09-26T05:02:52] haku: i put fiber i tape
[2024-09-26T05:03:06] haku: maybe put a sticker
[2024-09-26T05:03:22] haku: its done 😭
[2024-09-26T05:04:17] haku: i will put this in a bag exterior bag. till i make the p42
[2024-09-26T05:08:51] haku: this battery fits the laotie perfectly.
[2024-09-26T05:08:51] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-26T05:43:51] Yamal: You can ride your miniemotobike
[2024-09-26T05:44:58] Yamal: You will have your autumn session
[2024-09-26T05:49:47] haku: still need wiring and some qs8
[2024-09-26T05:50:04] haku: and the temporary bag
[2024-09-26T05:53:30] Yamal: This is fast !and do motor detección 🤩😂
[2024-09-26T05:55:05] Yamal: Try not to get arrested on the first day like the video you posted of arrests in Las Vegas
[2024-09-26T05:55:42] haku: i will pull a james and never get me
[2024-09-26T05:59:06] Yamal: <photos/photo_17990@26-09-2024_05-59-06.jpg>
[2024-09-26T06:00:39] haku: love that stuff. but mine full of sugar.
[2024-09-26T06:01:56] Yamal: Yesterday just I forget buy bread for breakfast
[2024-09-26T06:04:31] haku: oats better imo
[2024-09-26T06:04:43] haku: it fills you up
[2024-09-26T06:05:48] Yamal: Oat flakes are also a very good carbohydrate, protein and ideal for those who want to gain weight.
[2024-09-26T06:08:59] haku: they are also low in the glycemic index. means you digest it longer. i learned that from the vesc lords
[2024-09-26T06:09:38] haku: unlike white bread, potato and sweet potato
[2024-09-26T06:12:29] Yamal: Bread is mostly a habit, but from a nutritional point of view it does not provide much, although there are good breads made with good flours, sourdough and seeds. I have some friends whose wives make their own bread at home almost daily.
[2024-09-26T06:13:29] haku: thats a good life. wife making food. women woke nowadays. all they want is get to go fastfood. junk stuff
[2024-09-26T06:13:49] Yamal: In short, there is no good breakfast culture in the UE
[2024-09-26T06:15:54] haku: this guy just said this scooter will make ninebot obsolete. never ever boy. ninebot gang here https://youtu.be/8_jrZu2pG_g?si=kVHA6Mw-mMGn93IU
[2024-09-26T06:15:59] Yamal: I will soon be able to show you what a good breakfast is ;)
[2024-09-26T06:16:56] haku: steak and eggs but thanks to kamala/biden that got reduced to nothing
[2024-09-26T06:18:09] Yamal: Next week ✈️
[2024-09-26T06:21:06] Yamal: 15 hours in the future from Las Vegas
[2024-09-26T06:29:38] Yamal: Good thing, back to the hot weather,, I don’t want cold really!
[2024-09-26T06:30:08] haku: im okay with warm. not 48c weather
[2024-09-26T06:59:31] Yamal: <photos/photo_17992@26-09-2024_06-59-31.jpg>
[2024-09-26T07:07:22] Yamal: Something is wrong with the programming, very little power I know...

[2024-09-26T22:29:35] haku: kids nowadays. back then we only had coke and meth and weed
[2024-09-26T22:29:54] GABE: I don't like that shit like that.
[2024-09-26T22:30:02] GABE: The feeling you can tell is synthetic and disgusting
[2024-09-26T22:30:15] haku: never tried it
[2024-09-26T22:30:52] haku: nowadays kids snortimg xanax. whats that about?
[2024-09-26T22:30:52] GABE: Like ya sure if you pop an Addy you can have a joint but you'll probably be so busy you won't be aware you're stoned
[2024-09-26T22:30:57] GABE: Stupid.
[2024-09-26T22:31:05] GABE: Waste
[2024-09-26T22:31:08] GABE: essentially
[2024-09-26T22:31:19] GABE: That makes no sense it's not water soluble
[2024-09-26T22:31:20] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-26T22:31:29] haku: what you like more edibles or smoking?
[2024-09-26T22:32:13] haku: what about the kids on galaxy gas. have you done that too?
[2024-09-26T22:32:34] haku: i hear it makes them chop off thier dicks and tits
[2024-09-26T22:33:46] GABE: Try keep it cleaner.
[2024-09-26T22:33:50] GABE: Ew no fuck that dude
[2024-09-26T22:34:16] GABE: That actually makes you brain dead, like not overtime with hard drugs, that just takes your brain then and there
[2024-09-26T22:34:24] haku: its the hottest thing in the hood ive heard.
[2024-09-26T22:34:32] GABE: ITS SO STUPID ITS LIKE 100 A CAN

[2024-09-26T22:34:59] haku: crazy
[2024-09-26T22:35:10] GABE: you can have MORE fun with a pack of cigarettes, a blunt or two and a few shots of whiskey.
[2024-09-26T22:35:14] GABE: I just dont get it
[2024-09-26T22:35:28] haku: old school good job
[2024-09-26T22:35:31] GABE: apparently the gas makes you laugh all the time, makes me think people who are susceptible to its use are incredibly depressed and empty inside.
[2024-09-26T22:35:34] GABE: exactly .
[2024-09-26T22:36:01] haku: what about tide pods. have you heard of that?
[2024-09-26T22:36:08] GABE: Id try it tho to put it on my drug list.
[2024-09-26T22:36:14] haku: it was hot in 2015
[2024-09-26T22:36:17] GABE: Every drug I've done I've never gotten addicted to
[2024-09-26T22:36:23] GABE: Only caffeine and weed
[2024-09-26T22:36:25] GABE: Lol
[2024-09-26T22:36:34] haku: nicotine?
[2024-09-26T22:36:34] GABE: I've tried heroin like substances and didn't care after.
[2024-09-26T22:36:40] GABE: Not addicted
[2024-09-26T22:36:55] haku: kratom is pretty good for muscle pain
[2024-09-26T22:37:06] GABE: It is a real opioid.
[2024-09-26T22:37:08] GABE: Don't get that wrong
[2024-09-26T22:37:20] haku: is it. i take it
[2024-09-26T22:37:25] GABE: Sure drink a glass of the green slob and it's like taking 1/20 of a heroin needle.
[2024-09-26T22:37:28] sombre_enfant: Tf
[2024-09-26T22:37:28] haku: its plant form
[2024-09-26T22:37:29] GABE: be extremely careful
[2024-09-26T22:37:44] GABE: Actual conversion rate.
[2024-09-26T22:37:45] haku: no way
[2024-09-26T22:37:48] GABE: Yes.
[2024-09-26T22:37:57] GABE: All turns into morphine
[2024-09-26T22:38:03] haku: you dont OD of it
[2024-09-26T22:38:11] GABE: Yeah cause you need hella
[2024-09-26T22:38:31] GABE: I know people who try get off the green slob and they CANT
[2024-09-26T22:38:42] GABE: don't get used to it in your life.
[2024-09-26T22:38:54] GABE: It's an extra, not a necessary
[2024-09-26T22:39:00] haku: its like a natural muscle relaxer
[2024-09-26T22:39:06] GABE: Yeah Ireland prices bro
[2024-09-26T22:39:57] GABE: If you use it daily then I'd recommend stopping that
[2024-09-26T22:40:06] GABE: If you use anything daily you're kinda fucked
[2024-09-26T22:40:09] GABE: even weed
[2024-09-26T22:40:13] haku: not daily only on heavy days
[2024-09-26T22:40:21] GABE: don't let tolerance build.
[2024-09-26T22:40:29] GABE: You'll know when it does, trust me.
[2024-09-26T22:40:46] haku: its very expensive. i cant afford too much of it
[2024-09-26T22:41:02] GABE: I've abused codeine, taking 12 at once, Day 1 I vomited when I got off my scoot, day 7: No effect.
[2024-09-26T22:41:14] GABE: Omg when those opioids hit on the scooter
[2024-09-26T22:41:21] GABE: I was like nah I'm not gonna try scot
[2024-09-26T22:41:28] haku: im sure kratom is not an opiod
[2024-09-26T22:41:28] GABE: I was swaying like fuck and then I went on a curb and PUKED
[2024-09-26T22:41:37] GABE: Opiate most likely
[2024-09-26T22:41:39] GABE: look into it
[2024-09-26T22:41:42] GABE: Psyched substance
[2024-09-26T22:41:48] haku: its a different substance
[2024-09-26T22:41:48] GABE: TDC the drug classroom
[2024-09-26T22:41:55] GABE: Emulator.
[2024-09-26T22:42:04] haku: ive never failed a drug test on it
[2024-09-26T22:42:31] haku: back when i use to compete they test for stuff
[2024-09-26T22:42:38] haku: and jobs too
[2024-09-26T22:43:21] haku: im natty baby
[2024-09-26T22:44:25] GABE: Insane, it should test positive for heroin
[2024-09-26T22:44:28] GABE: That man's
[2024-09-26T22:44:29] GABE: means
[2024-09-26T22:44:38] GABE: You use so little Its not in your body like that.
[2024-09-26T22:44:50] haku: never did. lol
[2024-09-26T22:45:03] haku: thats not heroin dude. its a alkaloid
[2024-09-26T22:45:49] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I rode in the night and saw 2 big cans of this shit I bacame extremely sad
[2024-09-26T22:46:07] GABE: It acts like an opioid but isn't one. Like bath salts act as speed but aren't actual amphetamines. Disgusting analogy tho, because kratom is tamer..
[2024-09-26T22:46:13] haku: you have that there too?
[2024-09-26T22:46:15] GABE: So yes, it's an alkaloid
[2024-09-26T22:46:19] GABE: mitragunine
[2024-09-26T22:46:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes I was sad to discover
[2024-09-26T22:47:03] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's started with the small CO2 like cans and now it's big f your brains ons
[2024-09-26T22:47:33] haku: next thing will be helium
[2024-09-26T22:48:00] haku: then they start rapping on helium.
[2024-09-26T22:49:46] haku: whatever happened to good ol glue and sharpies. happier times
[2024-09-26T22:52:18] haku: https://youtube.com/shorts/1MvuO2QWiw0?si=hTyuMa6olQMZIdZL looks like mine
[2024-09-26T23:12:49] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What do you say big or small ?
[2024-09-26T23:12:49] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <video_file>
[2024-09-26T23:13:41] Finn: Insta 360 on the back is missing 🔥
[2024-09-26T23:16:02] haku: lights are good for night time riding. not a fan of these dualtron style lights though
[2024-09-26T23:16:31] haku: its like angel wings very cool
[2024-09-26T23:16:51] GABE: <photos/photo_18011@26-09-2024_23-16-51.jpg>
[2024-09-26T23:18:48] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No money 😔
[2024-09-26T23:19:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Have lots don't worry
[2024-09-26T23:19:54] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Going to have 8 strips for LEDs 2 wings one big Ali flashlight
[2024-09-26T23:20:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ha and one more strip that has brake and turn signals
[2024-09-26T23:21:44] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So 1 each side 5 under one one the rear and 4 stock lights and with gods help (because it complicated) light up rear wheel
[2024-09-26T23:21:44] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Shlomozero10 has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-26T23:26:24] crimeware: <video_file>
[2024-09-26T23:32:47] Smart Repair: What are your experiences with the throttle? I installed it on the scooter today and am very disappointed. The power is very difficult to regulate precisely...
[2024-09-26T23:32:57] Finn: Boring
[2024-09-26T23:37:00] haku: american politics just so funny. https://youtube.com/shorts/7AWnByX4lec?si=LnEUQkJwPHgk81h_
[2024-09-27T00:41:05] luffydnoob: Guys does anybody here knows how modify dualtron victor controllers ?
[2024-09-27T00:47:22] 'lekrsu': meanwhile u said you take it 5-7 days a week xd
[2024-09-27T00:47:32] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2024-09-27T00:50:49] GABE: Weed yeah
[2024-09-27T00:51:07] GABE: others were one offs
[2024-09-27T00:51:35] haku: its good imo. its been a while since i used it but planning on using it again.
[2024-09-27T00:52:23] haku: what battery and vesc do you have
[2024-09-27T00:54:50] Smart Repair: 20s Ubox 85/150
[2024-09-27T00:55:28] haku: did you calibrate it? theres a video about that
[2024-09-27T00:55:32] Smart Repair: my performance is relatively high, which is why you can feel any change immediately
[2024-09-27T00:56:29] Smart Repair: the calibration is clean and the throttle response is good across the entire range. it simply lacks sensitivity
[2024-09-27T00:56:37] haku: im not to sure whats going on with yours. i had one break before but i like it still
[2024-09-27T00:56:54] haku: i see.
[2024-09-27T00:57:32] Noname: Version 1 or 2
[2024-09-27T00:58:28] Smart Repair: bought 1 week ago, so I assume version 2
[2024-09-27T00:59:02] Noname: OK version 1 had a worse ratio fw/brk.
[2024-09-27T00:59:07] Smart Repair: If I saw it correctly, V2 has a plug. Then I have v2
[2024-09-27T01:01:02] Smart Repair: I'll probably switch back to the 5€ throttle... too bad, I was really looking forward to it 😞
[2024-09-27T01:33:31] haku: ill prolly do this to my motor. cool idea. https://youtube.com/shorts/XJIgmKSv7HU?si=sA7WcjhD55Vr_Eex
[2024-09-27T01:34:02] haku: nvm its not good
[2024-09-27T02:17:03] Noname: Though I saw somewhere one spring failed
[2024-09-27T02:17:45] Noname: Should have a wire connected to it. Spring brakes throttle stops
[2024-09-27T02:42:25] haku: its really good if you like ebrake. if not dont even bother. 1 handed controls is good
[2024-09-27T11:41:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: @Bradhaku am I right?

[2024-09-28T01:32:11] haku: <photos/photo_18031@28-09-2024_01-32-11.jpg>
[2024-09-28T01:33:08] Noname: <photos/photo_18032@28-09-2024_01-33-08.jpg>
[2024-09-28T01:33:56] Noname: Or drill from the other side 😆
[2024-09-28T01:35:19] haku: i need to thread it too
[2024-09-28T01:35:41] haku: i need to get this adapter
[2024-09-28T01:36:18] Noname: Lot of needs
[2024-09-28T01:36:37] Noname: Put tap in angle drill too
[2024-09-28T01:36:42] haku: it has to be sturdy
[2024-09-28T01:36:58] Noname: Through bolt
[2024-09-28T01:37:04] Noname: That's not thick
[2024-09-28T01:37:10] Noname: For threads
[2024-09-28T01:37:19] haku: i have a tap drill bit.
[2024-09-28T01:38:11] Noname: Oh good lord
[2024-09-28T01:38:27] Noname: Qvc's finest impulse buy
[2024-09-28T01:38:35] haku: i can also remove the plate completly but its welded.
[2024-09-28T01:38:42] haku: i have to reweld it
[2024-09-28T01:39:11] Noname: You can't fit drill in battery compartment and go inwards to vesc
[2024-09-28T01:39:30] haku: maybe impact drill yes
[2024-09-28T01:40:14] Noname: Sure
[2024-09-28T01:40:15] haku: <photos/photo_18035@28-09-2024_01-40-15.jpg>
[2024-09-28T01:40:54] haku: so just bolt with nut? the nut will be sticking out on the battery compartment
[2024-09-28T01:41:09] haku: ugly and takes space
[2024-09-28T01:43:22] Noname: Countersink a flat head bolt and nut inward then
[2024-09-28T01:43:40] haku: good idea
[2024-09-28T01:44:04] Noname: Only kind I have
[2024-09-28T01:44:07] haku: i need to get that. all i have is hex key
[2024-09-28T01:44:23] haku: <photos/photo_18036@28-09-2024_01-44-23.jpg>
[2024-09-28T01:44:49] Noname: Socket head cap screw
[2024-09-28T01:45:18] haku: your smart man. didnt even think that
[2024-09-28T01:46:24] Noname: No thats what the bulbus ones are called
[2024-09-28T01:47:09] haku: forgot the impact has a different bit attatchment.
[2024-09-28T01:47:26] Noname: The taps fit that
[2024-09-28T01:47:48] haku: shit your right
[2024-09-28T01:47:57] Noname: No way
[2024-09-28T01:47:58] haku: my bad fellas
[2024-09-28T01:48:13] haku: i never use impact so i didnt know
[2024-09-28T01:48:18] Noname: 1/4 hex shaft with a detent slot fits an impact
[2024-09-28T01:48:32] Noname: Crazy
[2024-09-28T01:49:12] Noname: Good lord I'd pay for a day without using one at this point
[2024-09-28T01:49:17] haku: dam short by mm
[2024-09-28T01:49:32] haku: <photos/photo_18038@28-09-2024_01-49-32.jpg>
[2024-09-28T01:49:46] Noname: That's a cm
[2024-09-28T01:49:54] haku: can i drill by hand?
[2024-09-28T01:50:06] haku: lol
[2024-09-28T01:50:27] haku: seious question is there a hand tool drill thats small
[2024-09-28T01:50:35] Noname: Ambition level?
[2024-09-28T01:50:56] haku: use a punch tool first.
[2024-09-28T01:51:16] Noname: Pull the collar like releasing bit and push in anymore?
[2024-09-28T01:51:31] haku: thats the most
[2024-09-28T01:52:07] Noname: Start grinding it down then
[2024-09-28T01:52:34] haku: its just that 1 contriller location. the one in the bottom is easy
[2024-09-28T01:53:18] Noname: Brushless drill? Take the rubber cap off the back 😆
[2024-09-28T01:53:33] haku: yea ill try that
[2024-09-28T01:53:43] haku: its brushed
[2024-09-28T01:53:49] haku: i think not sure
[2024-09-28T01:53:49] Noname: Shit
[2024-09-28T01:54:35] Noname: So cut the tap where the notch is with dremel
[2024-09-28T01:54:43] Noname: Stuff in drill more
[2024-09-28T01:56:31] haku: dam still wont fit
[2024-09-28T01:57:01] haku: thats brushes yea
[2024-09-28T01:57:44] haku: i have to say this minibike is woke right now
[2024-09-28T02:00:44] Noname: OK that wouldn't work as the bearing holder is on the cap
[2024-09-28T02:01:24] haku: ill prolly mount both in the bottom
[2024-09-28T02:01:52] haku: nevermind need one ontop
[2024-09-28T02:02:50] haku: i think the best i think is mount vesc on aluminum block and screw from the side
[2024-09-28T02:08:04] Noname: Quitter
[2024-09-28T02:09:29] haku: i can drill in there. i hope local hf has that adapter
[2024-09-28T02:10:54] Noname: Try the internet
[2024-09-28T02:10:57] Noname: It's amazing
[2024-09-28T02:11:56] haku: i prolly mount both on bottom like this one on the plate and on the bottom frame.
[2024-09-28T02:11:57] haku: <photos/photo_18041@28-09-2024_02-11-57.jpg>
[2024-09-28T02:13:14] haku: water or dust will just go in it
[2024-09-28T02:13:45] Noname: <photos/photo_18042@28-09-2024_02-13-45.jpg>
[2024-09-28T02:14:17] Noname: If I haven't killed mine with water or dust your fine
[2024-09-28T02:14:23] haku: thanks dude
[2024-09-28T02:14:32] Noname: I forge rivers
[2024-09-28T02:15:02] haku: i will not use a fender too so it will be really fucked if it rains
[2024-09-28T02:15:28] Noname: Print a cover for it
[2024-09-28T02:16:01] haku: ill check out harbor freight later or tommorow.
[2024-09-28T02:16:03] Noname: <animation>
[2024-09-28T02:23:47] haku: can i just woke it and use thermal paste to make it stick?
[2024-09-28T02:32:30] Noname: I saw a guy's controller fall off on a group ride. It was awesome for me, not for him
[2024-09-28T02:46:30] haku: here i am thinking i can mount the big fardrivers inside. i cant even drill holes
[2024-09-28T03:00:05] haku: both fit ontop if i just mount it on a 1cm alu block and bolt from the side. i think this is the best idea. unless it will creat alot of heat
[2024-09-28T03:02:04] haku: or a water cooling plate/block if we are sassy enough
[2024-09-28T06:22:12] puneDir: Fuck

[2024-09-28T11:22:11] puneDir: Now i need to fill that shit with something
[2024-09-28T11:22:42] GABE: If it expands like that, the kmh is surely inaccurate, it's going faster than said.

[2024-09-28T20:09:38] haku: its a 18cm x18cm x1 sheet
[2024-09-28T20:18:20] Happy Giraffe: Bruh no need for 10mm alu sheet, 3mm is enough
[2024-09-28T20:22:33] haku: i want to bolt it like this.
[2024-09-28T20:22:44] haku: so it locks in position
[2024-09-28T20:23:25] haku: i dont think you can thread a 3mm im not sure if possible

[2024-09-29T14:26:35] GABE: For adapting the V1 on rear, should I use short bolts to just fasten the steel speedfork to sheets together, or Use Longer beams? (i don't know what one is safer), but perhaps a beam would have more rigidity??

[2024-09-29T18:39:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Peak ? 200a
[2024-09-29T18:39:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I think
[2024-09-29T18:39:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: (the bms is 80 continues 200 peak ) 8c Celles
[2024-09-29T18:40:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But it's 1p because each cell is 28ah so 16s1p
[2024-09-29T19:13:46] GABE: Faster IMO.
[2024-09-29T19:13:49] GABE: as well.
[2024-09-29T19:22:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I've got no experience and tried that it didn't went good also hard to get Celles in good price
[2024-09-29T19:35:01] GABE: It's just solder wires bro what's to get
[2024-09-29T19:35:09] GABE: 3 ac wires bla bla and 2 DC wires
[2024-09-29T19:36:05] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Puch cells are easy but 18650/21700 are complicated to get pro level
[2024-09-29T19:47:05] GABE: Just do pouch bro
[2024-09-29T19:47:24] GABE: Li ion doesn't expand like that
[2024-09-29T19:47:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No space for more then what I have currently
[2024-09-29T19:47:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 60/28
[2024-09-29T19:47:46] GABE: Israel doesn't allow?
[2024-09-29T19:47:49] GABE: Or what
[2024-09-29T19:48:01] GABE: Another totalitarian state, like Turkey. Amazing.
[2024-09-29T19:48:08] GABE: Big no no import
[2024-09-29T19:48:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The market is sort of controled by the big battery makers
[2024-09-29T19:48:48] GABE: what a market.
[2024-09-29T19:49:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: You can import it's just not worth it for single battery
[2024-09-29T19:49:17] GABE: so how much would it cost to import 120 cells of Molicels for example?
[2024-09-29T19:49:24] GABE: Tax percentage wise
[2024-09-29T19:49:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Battery making and all of the custom pev market
[2024-09-29T19:49:33] GABE: can you not just slap a sticker on it saying the package is worth 5x less
[2024-09-29T19:49:39] GABE: then Tax is minimal
[2024-09-29T19:49:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The weight is also problem
[2024-09-29T19:50:10] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: For shipping
[2024-09-29T19:50:21] GABE: Israel is very far I assume.
[2024-09-29T19:50:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Does not work any more (used to)
[2024-09-29T19:50:44] GABE: I sent a package to an Israeli before and the postage was insane.
[2024-09-29T19:50:44] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Not a lot of sellers the will agree to ship here yes
[2024-09-29T19:51:24] GABE: Box of 2 new Alexa's, and post was like 35e or so, but anpost is cheap, and it was uninsured also
[2024-09-29T19:51:56] GABE: I as seller took the risk, I agreed to posting it beforehand.
[2024-09-29T19:52:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: That if u didn't go through ems shipping they are thiefs
[2024-09-29T19:52:27] GABE: What's ems
[2024-09-29T19:52:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Official Israel post international shipping company
[2024-09-29T19:53:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: They charge tax and release also
[2024-09-29T19:53:01] GABE: Assumed so, ah, so stealing off their own people.
[2024-09-29T19:53:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's going to be privatized soon
[2024-09-29T19:55:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: You can choose other ones like chita FedEx ups hfd and more but if it's is your first time shipping here you will go for the first result and what looks legit
[2024-09-29T20:03:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: https://www.tiktok.com/@rechargy?_t=8q8G88TruT6&_r=1 This is a local battery maker here
[2024-09-29T20:03:30] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: (one of the best very expensivek
[2024-09-29T20:16:31] crimeware: If german police suspects ur scooter is modified, they open it and I believe adding this is gonna make a lot of cops suicidal xd

[2024-09-29T20:51:50] Mirono escooters: Priorities at the front
[2024-09-29T20:52:09] Mirono escooters: I don't like the sea but scooting around there/ longboard/ building something like that seems like a fucking dream..
[2024-09-29T20:52:41] Mirono escooters: In winter no one's there and beach hard.. it's a free to use road 🤤
[2024-09-29T20:53:07] GABE: she could be in the box also
[2024-09-29T22:08:38] haku: @jamaludin_algarnati i tried indian food. is it just curry, rice and veggies. not for me dude
[2024-09-29T23:05:21] haku: you are finnaly seeing what quality of life means. sitting like a boss
[2024-09-29T23:07:49] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: You have to try paella, it is typical of Spain, especially Valencia.
[2024-09-29T23:31:43] Rose: Hey there dnr, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-09-30T02:08:21] haku: i think i will mount it vertical the phase connectors might get caught in something if i mount it this way.
[2024-09-30T02:09:46] Paolo ⁭: Lol
[2024-09-30T02:10:58] Paolo ⁭: But anyway I think you jump it and do wheelies , otherwise it doesn't broken. It's bad? Yes But it doesn't broken like that with normal use
[2024-09-30T02:11:34] haku: better yea?
[2024-09-30T02:12:38] haku: @jamessoderstrom wich ports will i use for this with adc adapter?
[2024-09-30T02:22:40] haku: dammit. im too dam strong.
[2024-09-30T02:22:58] haku: shouldve drilled a pilot hole. fuck me

[2024-09-30T02:38:46] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. puneDir has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-09-30T02:47:22] haku: cant unfuck myself now just grinded the bit down. it just keeps breaking. this is steel im tapping.
[2024-09-30T02:47:23] haku: <photos/photo_18081@30-09-2024_02-47-23.jpg>
[2024-09-30T02:48:15] haku: im gonna have to live with this poop now
[2024-09-30T02:48:49] Mirono escooters: Did you drill it to the proper size? Used tapping oil?
[2024-09-30T02:49:00] Mirono escooters: And carefully hand tapped
[2024-09-30T02:49:08] Mirono escooters: Surely didn't just take a drill to it 🥲
[2024-09-30T02:49:24] haku: nope. its a drill tap in one
[2024-09-30T02:49:43] haku: the ali express dollar stuff
[2024-09-30T02:50:07] Mirono escooters: Bweh, garbage
[2024-09-30T02:50:19] haku: <photos/photo_18082@30-09-2024_02-50-19.jpg>
[2024-09-30T02:50:35] haku: i have a spare i think. i will oil and do pilot holes first
[2024-09-30T02:51:09] haku: this stuff worked on the aluminum laotie frame.
[2024-09-30T02:52:49] haku: Noname powertool world champ what should i do?
[2024-09-30T02:53:58] Noname: Lol
[2024-09-30T02:54:19] Noname: Does a magnet stick.to.it. thought was aluminum
[2024-09-30T02:54:51] haku: no but its pretty hard. harder than the laotie frame
[2024-09-30T02:56:45] Noname: Depends is it hammered in there? Sometimes you can get a screwdriver and tap it from an edge to reverse it.
[2024-09-30T02:57:12] Noname: Id say move it up a lil try again and paint over it
[2024-09-30T02:58:11] Noname: Wtf size it that other tap jesus
[2024-09-30T02:58:52] haku: m4 is the one that broke
[2024-09-30T02:59:07] haku: very skinny bit
[2024-09-30T02:59:14] Noname: Yeah 4 is fragile
[2024-09-30T02:59:47] Noname: Taps are hard but not strong
[2024-09-30T02:59:52] haku: pilot hole first then?
[2024-09-30T03:00:36] Noname: That's the trouble with those multi. As your drilling you end up smacking the tap in full send
[2024-09-30T03:01:12] Noname: Drill pilot. Tap it real gentle in and out to clear chips. And oil or lube
[2024-09-30T03:06:51] haku: ill use 5/32 for pilot hole
[2024-09-30T03:07:20] haku: ill use the harbor freight titanium coated bit
[2024-09-30T03:07:38] Noname: Only the best 👌
[2024-09-30T03:29:17] haku: i think this should be secure. now the hard part. mounting the top vesc.
[2024-09-30T03:39:44] haku: this is why i wanted to tap it. instead of putting a nut on the end. m4×8 is pretty flush on the battery compartment.
[2024-09-30T03:40:00] haku: <photos/photo_18084@30-09-2024_03-40-00.jpg>
[2024-09-30T03:48:50] Noname: Don't forget thermal paste
[2024-09-30T03:49:33] haku: ofcouse. i will take it off and test it first. im just measuring how long cables need to be
[2024-09-30T04:50:07] haku: nice and snug.
[2024-09-30T04:54:52] haku: those ali drill tap bits doesnt really need pilot holes. it just needs to be a slow drill and oil.
[2024-09-30T04:56:29] haku: i think alibaba stuff should be arriving soon and bags/qs8 should arrive next week. it should be done by then 😜
[2024-09-30T04:57:43] Noname: Yeah boi
[2024-09-30T04:57:56] Noname: Meanwhile I did like 180mi this weekend
[2024-09-30T05:01:26] haku: whut
[2024-09-30T05:01:45] haku: how many charge
[2024-09-30T05:03:52] Noname: Just a lil trickle charge the first night. For a few miles home. Had to wait for a friend to charge so filled it from 50%. 80mi per charge lol
[2024-09-30T05:04:57] Noname: But we've been cranking along
[2024-09-30T05:07:33] haku: 80 miles is good. at what speed?
[2024-09-30T05:07:46] Noname: 30 to 40
[2024-09-30T05:07:55] haku: thats not bad.
[2024-09-30T05:07:59] Noname: Nope
[2024-09-30T05:08:32] haku: thats what i want to do. ride the whole vegas from north to south
[2024-09-30T05:08:50] Noname: 4.2ah cells you have?
[2024-09-30T05:09:07] haku: 40t is 4ah i think
[2024-09-30T05:09:18] haku: p42 is 4.2
[2024-09-30T05:09:29] Noname: You have same wh with 20p
[2024-09-30T05:09:29] haku: it will be a mix of both
[2024-09-30T05:10:08] Noname: And flat there so you'll hit 80 np
[2024-09-30T05:10:37] Noname: Why cry
[2024-09-30T05:10:58] haku: flat tire?
[2024-09-30T05:11:04] haku: or flat land
[2024-09-30T05:11:09] Noname: Land
[2024-09-30T05:11:23] haku: theres a slight incline going north
[2024-09-30T05:12:29] Noname: 700ft elevation change on my ride
[2024-09-30T05:12:42] haku: wow
[2024-09-30T05:12:57] haku: lots of hills?
[2024-09-30T05:13:30] haku: ill just prolly end up doing burnouts in the hood
[2024-09-30T05:13:52] haku: 2 wheel burnouts
[2024-09-30T05:16:12] Noname: Your front will spin and drift while the rear trys to pass the front
[2024-09-30T05:16:16] haku: @jamessoderstrom you think its a good idea opening up vesc and check for solder balls before wiring? or i can trust amy?
[2024-09-30T05:16:53] Noname: Mine was fine
[2024-09-30T05:16:53] haku: it will be rear wheel going forward and front going backwards. ive seen it done before
[2024-09-30T05:17:21] haku: nice
[2024-09-30T05:17:21] Noname: Better the other way
[2024-09-30T05:36:52] haku: lots of space in the rear compartment for more batteries. its just a wierd configuration.
[2024-09-30T05:37:57] haku: it will be a heavy ass mini bike scoot if i fill the frame lol
[2024-09-30T05:49:32] Noname: What's the white box hold for cells again
[2024-09-30T05:51:52] haku: its a mock battery box.
[2024-09-30T05:52:08] Noname: Yea how many cells fit there
[2024-09-30T05:52:12] haku: how big the pack will be i think

[2024-09-30T05:54:19] haku: i think i might be able to fit more.we will see
[2024-09-30T05:54:32] haku: its 6
[2024-09-30T05:55:49] Noname: Sorry bout your small.penis
[2024-09-30T05:57:12] haku: i need to match its size with a minibike scoot
[2024-09-30T05:59:41] haku: longer handlebars really does help with stability yea? i might use my laotie handlebars. its longer
[2024-09-30T06:01:49] NetworkDir: I didn't jump really but i can accept wheelies. At all design issue their on new gens and something like X for reinforced lol

[2024-09-30T06:09:53] haku: is this correct the harder the aluminum. the more its prone to cracks and breaking?
[2024-09-30T06:11:30] Noname: Leverage
[2024-09-30T06:12:03] Noname: Yeah those Lil shocks scare me. Cut one to get the spring off, not impressed

[2024-09-30T07:01:48] NetworkDir: Rear ez but front shit
[2024-09-30T07:02:21] NetworkDir: 125mm very bad but if you can made 145mm for front should fine also better trail
[2024-09-30T08:33:26] GABE: Guys, it's Year TWO of electrical engineering and they're teaching us how DC motors work They want us to write a paper. Which is fine, I can do that without attending the laboratory.
[2024-09-30T08:33:40] GABE: I'm deadaas just not going in for now.
[2024-09-30T08:34:05] GABE: Like that is so fucking irrelevant, are they allergic to teaching AC?
[2024-09-30T08:34:41] GABE: Teacher "You can't get the wires wrong with an AC motor" Me: Yes and No and No and Yes. 🤣 They spent all fucking year teaching AC theory with multiple power sources in FIRST year but WONT tell us how an AC Motor works, incredible.

[2024-09-30T14:53:13] GABE: Can a scooter function on one motor? or will it create inefficiency due to the second motor acting like a dynamo with no output.
[2024-09-30T14:53:35] GABE: My Ebike, it's hard to cycle without a battery because the motor acts as a dynamo.
[2024-09-30T14:53:39] GABE: Even when phases are disconnected.
[2024-09-30T14:53:54] GABE: Obviously, that inefficiency is minimal when you have 20hp motor, but does it cause issues long term?
[2024-09-30T14:54:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So u afraid of water getting in through the sides ?
[2024-09-30T14:54:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Isn't nylon bag (or something similar) can solve it easy ?

[2024-09-30T19:25:29] Jan: You dont need to, packing space is tight enough that the battery doesnt move 1mm

[2024-10-01T11:20:35] NetworkDir: Also i forget to say this scooter weight like 100kg and rider 120kg so if you want compare with another scooter total weight is 220kg XD

[2024-10-01T14:54:29] puneDir: @NetworkDir 😆🤜🤛
[2024-10-01T15:33:17] puneDir: Yes
[2024-10-01T15:33:26] puneDir: James i want to ask you something
[2024-10-01T15:33:42] puneDir: My zero kinda saturates after 83 kmh
[2024-10-01T15:33:56] puneDir: I need to slightly release throttle to keep accelerate
[2024-10-01T15:34:07] puneDir: Vibrates slightly and doesnt accelerate more
[2024-10-01T15:34:13] puneDir: Keeps pulling amps but stucks
[2024-10-01T15:34:37] puneDir: No
[2024-10-01T15:34:49] puneDir: I can barely feel the vibration
[2024-10-01T15:34:53] puneDir: But it stucks at 83
[2024-10-01T15:35:14] puneDir: Yes same

[2024-10-01T16:28:33] Jan: Like when you hold vesc phase wires against a glassplate lol
[2024-10-01T16:29:10] puneDir: But it works
[2024-10-01T16:29:12] puneDir: Runs fine
[2024-10-01T16:29:28] NetworkDir: yes :D
[2024-10-01T16:29:38] puneDir: @jamessoderstrom can you listen the sound on dms

[2024-10-01T16:30:16] NetworkDir: makerbase :)
[2024-10-01T16:31:11] puneDir: Maybe wiring issue
[2024-10-01T16:31:44] NetworkDir: wiring issue for this result should connect phase with 0.001mm alu cable
[2024-10-01T16:33:55] puneDir: But how it has good performance then?
[2024-10-01T16:34:09] 'lekrsu': You say it doesn't
[2024-10-01T16:41:58] puneDir: <photos/photo_18121@01-10-2024_16-41-58.jpg>
[2024-10-01T16:42:02] puneDir: Fixed i guess
[2024-10-01T16:44:12] puneDir: 37
[2024-10-01T16:44:16] puneDir: Its because of temp
[2024-10-01T16:44:21] puneDir: My old one was 37 too
[2024-10-01T16:44:26] puneDir: But its cold now

[2024-10-01T17:31:46] haku: bro just use flush cutters on those. you dont want to remove the nickel.coat
[2024-10-01T17:32:22] haku: are you using this for a different build?
[2024-10-01T17:35:24] Patrick: Yes
[2024-10-01T17:43:23] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I took apart the battery to make 2 new ones to sell so I can recover some money
[2024-10-01T17:43:52] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: if only remove the nickel stuck to the cell
[2024-10-01T17:44:36] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <video_file>

[2024-10-01T17:48:41] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: A friend assembles it and I help him with everything else except soldering and installing the BMS.
[2024-10-01T17:48:48] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 🥲
[2024-10-01T18:22:29] puneDir: Grinding better
[2024-10-01T18:45:58] haku: you can weld over the little nickle or copper stuck in the cell.
[2024-10-01T18:46:03] GABE: I'm the only one that's allowed grind to save 1mm on clearance.
[2024-10-01T18:46:07] GABE: Not you guys
[2024-10-01T18:46:26] haku: 1mm on the battery?
[2024-10-01T18:46:44] GABE: about that with 2x sure
[2024-10-01T18:47:41] GABE: top and bottom
[2024-10-01T18:47:54] GABE: 4x so 2mm
[2024-10-01T18:48:07] haku: you grinding the + on the battery? what are yoi saying?
[2024-10-01T18:48:22] GABE: Molicel pack being rebuilt.
[2024-10-01T19:46:45] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It is not to save space, we have always cleaned the remains of Nikel this way.
[2024-10-01T20:47:40] GABE: only steel to steel right
[2024-10-01T22:01:46] Pandalgns: Ride with a little rain 😂😂 this shit gonna blow
[2024-10-01T23:14:06] haku: what motor is that? dualtron?
[2024-10-01T23:15:00] Pandalgns: Nope, are a janobike t10 motors 52v 1000w
[2024-10-01T23:28:49] haku: do you like that motor? what is magnet?
[2024-10-01T23:29:19] Pandalgns: I dont know, probably 40h
[2024-10-01T23:29:35] Pandalgns: I love this motors, so hard motors and powerfull
[2024-10-01T23:29:56] Pandalgns: I have 4000w peak with 52v 180a phase
[2024-10-01T23:29:59] haku: what voltage and current your using?
[2024-10-01T23:30:26] haku: nice
[2024-10-01T23:30:45] haku: thats a g30 or xiaomi?
[2024-10-01T23:30:56] Pandalgns: Xiaomi pro frame
[2024-10-01T23:31:14] Pandalgns: A bit small and ligth
[2024-10-01T23:31:23] Pandalgns: Than g30
[2024-10-01T23:31:28] 'lekrsu': If only it was a bit wider
[2024-10-01T23:33:48] Pandalgns: The truth is that it is already too small for me since I have the halo t107 pro, I gave it to my girlfriend, this Xiaomi was my first project and now I am updating it with better things but it is hers, although while I have the halo disassembled to update it I use this sometimes and I'm surprised how powerful the little one is
[2024-10-01T23:52:53] haku: is there a side by side comparison to g30. i always get this 2 confused
[2024-10-02T00:37:42] haku: good thing i opened. my drill particles got to it.
[2024-10-02T00:37:42] haku: <photos/photo_18125@02-10-2024_00-37-42.jpg>
[2024-10-02T00:39:00] haku: no solder balls though
[2024-10-02T00:40:55] haku: i dont understand why they wont just solder 1 6awg instead of 2 cables
[2024-10-02T00:49:44] haku: this a good price isnt it?
[2024-10-02T00:49:44] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-02T00:50:35] GABE: Because 6awg would make it taller.
[2024-10-02T00:52:19] haku: dam amy flashing me.
[2024-10-02T01:22:45] haku: now i see it yea
[2024-10-02T01:24:31] haku: flux splatters too
[2024-10-02T01:24:56] 'lekrsu': Flux won't really short anything though
[2024-10-02T01:36:43] 'lekrsu': The label says "no clean" and I live by those words 😁
[2024-10-02T01:52:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Well my scooter is officially scary
[2024-10-02T01:55:27] Noname: Max power?
[2024-10-02T02:01:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 8.5-9kw
[2024-10-02T02:01:54] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 104kmh
[2024-10-02T02:02:22] Noname: Nice

[2024-10-02T02:28:55] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: @Bradhaku
[2024-10-02T02:33:44] haku: i think its ready boys.
[2024-10-02T03:59:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: @Bradhaku (again)
[2024-10-02T04:58:48] haku: how are these detection results?
[2024-10-02T04:58:57] haku: wow.
[2024-10-02T04:58:57] haku: <video_file>
[2024-10-02T05:02:58] haku: thanks for the guidance @jamessoderstrom
[2024-10-02T05:11:00] Noname: Sweet now quickly duck tape that shit on the side and go for a spin like I would
[2024-10-02T05:13:20] haku: im trying to figure out the ebrake for the spinny. idk why its not braking
[2024-10-02T05:32:50] haku: i changed the bullet shrink wrap to this thick ones. the thin ones just slide out when you unplug it.
[2024-10-02T05:33:13] haku: it has like glue in it i think
[2024-10-02T05:38:33] haku: you have to be shitting me alibaba. damn.
[2024-10-02T05:38:43] Noname: I have some of that. It's like marine shrink or whatever but it's nice
[2024-10-02T05:43:39] haku: yea good stuff. its cheap too i think this is what ill use for batteries and scooters now
[2024-10-02T05:44:10] Noname: Well if you don't mind the glue
[2024-10-02T05:44:46] haku: it should be okay for battery cables and stuff i think
[2024-10-02T05:52:49] haku: so dissapointed at alibaba. i dont think they actually shipped it.
[2024-10-02T05:53:38] haku: ill ride without rear brakes. but ill use ebrake and front brake.
[2024-10-02T05:56:28] haku: well more time for me to make long shlong battery anyway.

[2024-10-02T07:28:56] haku: yea. it will be folded so it wont be that long.
[2024-10-02T07:29:10] Jason: mmm
[2024-10-02T07:29:11] Jason: nice
[2024-10-02T09:34:39] GABE: Maybe you will get your 35kw
[2024-10-02T09:36:47] GABE: Fuck.. that goes deep.
[2024-10-02T09:40:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <video_file>
[2024-10-02T09:46:27] GABE: Imagine 5pwide
[2024-10-02T10:32:04] Rose: Hey there Dj, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-10-02T11:10:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I only saw v1 ,but if wiring done right maybe setup is wrong for it, I really enjoyed to use spin- y ,even shit terrain, dirt roads With the cc function it was easy to speed up
[2024-10-02T11:38:05] haku: yes with dual motors and a ton of amps maybe
[2024-10-02T11:46:09] GABE: you got dual ya
[2024-10-02T11:46:15] GABE: Lol, our rides will be the exact same.
[2024-10-02T11:46:22] GABE: 20s11/12p and 70h 22x3 iirc.
[2024-10-02T11:46:30] GABE: Basically the same vehicle across sea.
[2024-10-02T11:50:54] haku: remember sit like a boss. then we can be the same vehicle
[2024-10-02T11:58:17] GABE: Oh bro I'll be sitting and I may even put two seats on it because elongated frame.
[2024-10-02T11:58:40] GABE: My IQ and understanding of physics is high enough to not die due to a fucking seat.
[2024-10-02T11:59:56] GABE: If I got 65h I would regret it. 75h would also cause so much issues because of fitting.
[2024-10-02T12:00:14] GABE: 70h is absolutely maximum for speed fork on rear Almost as if it was made for it.
[2024-10-02T12:00:38] GABE: sure can add metal blocks but fuck that amirite
[2024-10-02T12:00:38] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-02T12:01:25] haku: 65h is perfect for g30 imo. 11 70h requires alot of custom cnc and $$
[2024-10-02T12:03:03] haku: after i get this running ill work on g30. but need to sell my other scooters and bike to get funding
[2024-10-02T12:03:54] haku: vsett has served me well but its still too big imo. not too portable
[2024-10-02T12:17:13] GABE: Now that there's no more v1s it's not possible unless you Cnc it yourself
[2024-10-02T12:18:20] GABE: 70h 10" still fine
[2024-10-02T12:18:30] GABE: ACC, those don't fit on rear
[2024-10-02T12:18:38] GABE: Back to square 1.
[2024-10-02T12:19:27] haku: is there a 10" 70h?
[2024-10-02T12:20:08] GABE: Wait, there isn't? I didn't even know.
[2024-10-02T12:21:06] GABE: Tyres 150 V1s 230. Spring 80ish About 450€ just to mount a bigger battery pack.
[2024-10-02T12:21:11] haku: im not sure too. i think 65 is the most
[2024-10-02T12:21:20] GABE: motors about same price..
[2024-10-02T12:21:22] GABE: doesn't count.
[2024-10-02T12:21:57] haku: yea it all adds up. this hobby is expensive
[2024-10-02T12:22:12] GABE: I've spent 2000 and my scooter is In its parts rn lolz
[2024-10-02T12:22:22] GABE: Not even began yet but at least I know how to mount it all.
[2024-10-02T12:22:36] GABE: I'm so lucky I didn't choose 75h.
[2024-10-02T12:22:49] GABE: I never willingly agreed to this lol, it just happened.
[2024-10-02T12:22:54] GABE: Kek
[2024-10-02T12:22:54] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-02T12:23:00] haku: but it will be better and faster than any 5k "hperscooter"
[2024-10-02T12:24:27] 'lekrsu': I know the feeling 😁
[2024-10-02T12:24:47] 'lekrsu': I'm hotgluing my diy jst
[2024-10-02T12:25:12] haku: i wonder what the difference is on 70h and 75h.
[2024-10-02T12:25:23] GABE: No difference than me spending 1000€ on a brushless RC truck.
[2024-10-02T12:25:30] GABE: Then suddenly losing interest in the hobby.
[2024-10-02T12:25:47] GABE: 75/70 Kilowatts more.
[2024-10-02T12:25:50] haku: buy on sale. thats. the most advice i can give.
[2024-10-02T12:26:01] GABE: 8-10% more amps technically
[2024-10-02T12:26:08] GABE: but neeed more amps to push
[2024-10-02T12:26:13] haku: really wow
[2024-10-02T12:26:20] 'lekrsu': 🕷️🕸️
[2024-10-02T12:26:22] GABE: Volume works that way physically
[2024-10-02T12:26:27] GABE: if you assume the magnets work that way
[2024-10-02T12:26:33] GABE: with Math you must assume
[2024-10-02T12:26:42] 'lekrsu': G2 hall has temp on a separate jst
[2024-10-02T12:26:44] haku: i can fit 75h but ill do a qs motor next time fora bike
[2024-10-02T12:27:09] 'lekrsu': <video_file>
[2024-10-02T12:27:44] haku: you put temp sensor on your motor. nice
[2024-10-02T12:27:46] 'lekrsu': Sounds much better than the G2 controller does, lol.
[2024-10-02T12:27:51] 'lekrsu': Already has one
[2024-10-02T12:27:54] GABE: 50h has twice as less windings as 100h so in theory 100h can saturate 2x more amps in those windings.
[2024-10-02T12:28:03] GABE: But, dual 50h is still better than single 100.
[2024-10-02T12:28:34] haku: it comes from the factory like that?
[2024-10-02T12:28:37] GABE: So necessary for those little shits.
[2024-10-02T12:28:38] 'lekrsu': <photos/photo_18135@02-10-2024_12-28-38.jpg>
[2024-10-02T12:29:57] haku: the g1 g30 motor is actually really good
[2024-10-02T14:00:19] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-10-02T14:00:30] puneDir: 50-70 1 seconds:D
[2024-10-02T15:03:48] Noname: Not a scooterino but there's a polin mini streetbike near me.
[2024-10-02T15:27:41] puneDir: Traction controll is amazing
[2024-10-02T15:29:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Just saying, that i saw 3 motor like this irl what had problems ,rim broking near the valve ,so better keep an eye out
[2024-10-02T15:30:58] 'lekrsu': Some use "factory pressure" and just ride until the rim breaks.
[2024-10-02T15:32:23] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2024-10-02T15:41:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That can be true ,but i saw this also on a new motor after 1 week of use ,so some is surly factory defo. Also why this never happened with g30 rim🤷‍♂ Anyway i said this for you ,not against you
[2024-10-02T15:56:59] Noname: <animation>
[2024-10-02T15:59:07] 'lekrsu': <animation>
[2024-10-02T18:51:15] haku: do it
[2024-10-02T18:52:38] haku: what motor is in it? lawnmower?
[2024-10-02T19:55:10] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: The bike is a “vespino” brand 🤣
[2024-10-02T19:56:57] haku: my kid would enjoy that minibike. but damn too poor
[2024-10-02T20:04:23] Noname: Same
[2024-10-02T20:04:47] haku: how muxh do those usually cost?
[2024-10-02T20:08:49] Noname: Idk no price listed on website so I'd imagine I'd never afford a new one.
[2024-10-02T20:10:45] haku: anyway my boy wont know the difference between that and his peak g30 bike.
[2024-10-02T20:30:03] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: first steps
[2024-10-02T20:30:49] haku: i like that you put guides. good idea
[2024-10-02T20:32:22] haku: thinking about just cutting the copper for my new battery gives me a headache
[2024-10-02T20:41:23] haku: anybody know whats this guy doing measuring the magnets? what is that tool and what is he doing there? https://youtube.com/shorts/B_ocuZETOpg?si=N4bHmpDV-277xlqB
[2024-10-02T20:45:19] haku: any engineers explain what that is? or is that china secret tech
[2024-10-02T20:47:06] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I had to make the new battery no matter what, there is no cloud that does not come for good 🤣
[2024-10-02T21:59:40] GABE: It's like a little organism
[2024-10-02T22:00:20] GABE: You mean the heat proof silicone? that's whatever.
[2024-10-02T22:01:18] haku: no the magnet measuring device his using. what is that? i think he made the magnets stronger in the video
[2024-10-02T22:13:05] GABE: I think he put on new magnets
[2024-10-02T22:13:12] GABE: That is such a waste of time.
[2024-10-02T22:13:21] GABE: Cost of that probably more expensive than a new motor
[2024-10-02T22:26:10] haku: no look at the video. he made the magnets stronger with that yellow machine
[2024-10-02T22:27:18] haku: theres a machine that demagnetizes/magnetize magnets.
[2024-10-02T22:27:39] haku: my question is what that tool hes using to measure magnets
[2024-10-02T22:37:38] GABE: Yeah that was my second assumption
[2024-10-02T22:40:40] Noname: Gauss meter
[2024-10-02T22:41:03] haku: thank you ill take note of that.
[2024-10-02T22:41:26] haku: let me check ali
[2024-10-02T22:42:04] Noname: You haven't even poo'd your pants you need to strengthen motors?
[2024-10-02T22:42:17] haku: dam boy.
[2024-10-02T22:42:35] haku: im really fascinated with how these motors work
[2024-10-02T22:44:33] haku: the science behind it is very fascinating
[2024-10-02T23:03:38] GABE: Essentially same as DC.
[2024-10-02T23:04:04] GABE: Except imagine a DC motor with the brushes hardwired, and the magnet being the moving part.
[2024-10-02T23:04:25] GABE: It's just Electromagnetism in a circle
[2024-10-02T23:05:05] GABE: DC motors just add an extra step towards moving.
[2024-10-02T23:05:30] GABE: Brushes - Stator - Magnets Rather than Stator -> Magnets The brushes and the phases in the commutator are essentially a retro version of a Hall sensor, each stage to the next, perfectly timed. Extreme speed control like no other, not even a hall sensor is as good as speed control, it's an analog version.
[2024-10-02T23:05:30] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-03T04:47:29] haku: my ubox turned on without a battery plugged. capacitors do that?
[2024-10-03T05:03:12] Noname: For a second or two yeah. That's why you turn on after disconnect battery when doing wiring etc. can still short things
[2024-10-03T05:12:40] haku: what is the bit to make holes bigger? you know what im talking about yea?
[2024-10-03T05:12:53] Noname: Step drill
[2024-10-03T05:12:56] haku: i want to use this for power botton
[2024-10-03T05:13:06] haku: thanks
[2024-10-03T05:13:21] haku: not step bro right 😭
[2024-10-03T05:13:30] Noname: The harbor freight ones are really good. Regular drill bits prob not
[2024-10-03T05:13:46] Noname: Yeah drill your step bro
[2024-10-03T05:18:43] haku: dude this comes with a saw drill whatever its used for. is it for oval holes?
[2024-10-03T05:20:50] Noname: Idk about those bits. It's a drill you can side cut with like oblong a hole if your a hack or.work for my company
[2024-10-03T05:21:44] Noname: Get the Bauer ones
[2024-10-03T05:24:01] haku: i need to cut a rectangle hole for charging too. im using these mounted xt60.
[2024-10-03T05:25:36] haku: harbor freight prices has gone up. its not the same prices online. instore is more expensive
[2024-10-03T05:29:31] Noname: 😮
[2024-10-03T05:31:20] haku: powertool world champ. is this better for tightening axle nuts or drill is better?
[2024-10-03T05:31:29] haku: <photos/photo_18142@03-10-2024_05-31-29.jpg>
[2024-10-03T05:32:12] Noname: On a scooter? Use a ratchet you don't get a lot of feedback with impacts and can over do it
[2024-10-03T05:45:49] haku: its more masculine to hear the impact drill though
[2024-10-03T05:47:56] haku: its sounds very toxic masculine. so loud
[2024-10-03T05:59:24] haku: i can prolly fit 2p more.
[2024-10-03T05:59:25] haku: <photos/photo_18144@03-10-2024_05-59-25.jpg>

[2024-10-03T05:59:55] haku: lots of room
[2024-10-03T06:02:05] haku: holders by @jamessoderstrom baby
[2024-10-03T06:02:05] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-03T06:25:17] Rose: Hey there Keny, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-10-03T06:51:40] haku: so dissapointed in china right now. i dont love them atm.
[2024-10-03T06:52:39] haku: they say its a holiday like 4th of july. we only get 1 day. they get a whole month wtf
[2024-10-03T09:34:49] GABE: what tyres are on that vehicle
[2024-10-03T10:08:23] haku: 13 china tires
[2024-10-03T10:49:16] GABE: Not worried?
[2024-10-03T10:49:48] GABE: 11" pmts may help with centre of gravity or whatever. Could be safer. Less clearance does that.
[2024-10-03T10:50:00] GABE: Try the 13"
[2024-10-03T13:29:50] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGdJJf8Ao/
[2024-10-03T14:38:01] haku: not at all
[2024-10-03T16:20:44] Yamal: BREMBO👍
[2024-10-03T17:04:06] crimeware: Tiktok should stop existing
[2024-10-03T17:04:17] crimeware: I will not install their shit ass app for a 5s video clip

[2024-10-03T17:32:05] Face de Pin Sucé: Here you can feel the power of the most powerful Escooter in the world x)
[2024-10-03T17:32:50] Face de Pin Sucé: Considering that the BMS had a problem, we had to take a small 20S8P 40T battery (normally it has a 22S11P battery)
[2024-10-03T17:45:10] Yamal: 🤫
[2024-10-03T17:46:12] crimeware: <photos/photo_18147@03-10-2024_17-46-12.jpg>
[2024-10-03T17:47:36] Yamal: Why didn't you get the GPS speed in the tunnel?
[2024-10-03T17:52:27] Yamal: You said that it would be a project for 2025, why is there such a rush...? :)
[2024-10-03T17:52:31] crimeware: GPS... Tunnel...?
[2024-10-03T17:53:57] Yamal: He posted some speed tests in a tunnel
[2024-10-03T17:59:06] crimeware: Holidays....
[2024-10-03T17:59:23] crimeware: You need to remember, chinese people work harf as fuck for very little pay....
[2024-10-03T18:01:44] Face de Pin Sucé: Because in tunnel, no GPS Signal
[2024-10-03T18:01:52] Yamal: I'm sorry about your scooter brother, when I saw it I didn't believe it, I left you stranded in the middle of the night, I see that the scooter issue is moving a lot in your country, do you already have a new frame in mind,,?
[2024-10-03T18:02:13] Face de Pin Sucé: 16V sag somewhere in the records x)
[2024-10-03T18:02:18] Yamal: True ^^’
[2024-10-03T18:02:33] Yamal: We want to see 170kmh on scooter
[2024-10-03T18:02:54] haku: where you been. i thought the olympic blueman got you!.
[2024-10-03T18:03:32] haku: no rush just want to ride asap
[2024-10-03T18:04:02] Face de Pin Sucé: If weather is okay, next week we are on track with 800m straight line, so we will be able to make a proper video
[2024-10-03T18:04:06] Face de Pin Sucé: Including dragy too
[2024-10-03T18:04:11] NetworkDir: thanks ! if i found vsett 10+ frame i will swap but if not i will sell all parts on buy motorcycle or car ;)
[2024-10-03T18:05:17] Yamal: I have been busy in the days before the holidays, leaving things ready at work and preparing the house a little for a month that I will be alone, the blue man?? come now!!! You know it's not my style, I'm already looking for a way to get the second wife! xd
[2024-10-03T18:05:52] haku: good to hear from you bro
[2024-10-03T18:07:38] Yamal: Let's see if there's any luck, I don't think you'll have a problem finding a new frame, from what I see your country is full! a motorcycle or a car, no please!!!! more fun e-scooters, if anything a van to be able to put the e-scooters inside!
[2024-10-03T18:08:40] Yamal: Very little 800m
[2024-10-03T18:09:03] Face de Pin Sucé: more than enough for us
[2024-10-03T18:10:57] Face de Pin Sucé: We don't start from 0Kmh so will be very large
[2024-10-03T18:11:20] Yamal: Does it rain a lot in your city or what?
[2024-10-03T18:11:20] Yamal: France 🌧7 days
[2024-10-03T18:11:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Pilot told me that he can start the straight at around 90Kmh looking at the corner before
[2024-10-03T18:12:09] puneDir: <photos/photo_18148@03-10-2024_18-12-09.jpg>
[2024-10-03T18:12:11] Face de Pin Sucé: It depends, but we don't perform those kind of speeds on road with video, because we want to be """legal""" otherwise, I could tell you we already did those speeds x)
[2024-10-03T18:13:40] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-10-03T18:14:14] Yamal: You are the most legal, you have support from the federation, I don't think they will put you in jail on the team! If that were the case, I will bring you the tobacco and the sweets xD
[2024-10-03T18:15:41] Yamal: Nice !I really need to get a camera for November !
[2024-10-03T18:25:09] haku: how? you using 22x3 and everyone else on 33x2?
[2024-10-03T18:29:15] haku: i think you have the title of worlds fastest zero 10 now since the other one broke
[2024-10-03T18:41:01] puneDir: It was always the fastest but
[2024-10-03T18:41:47] NetworkDir: 😆
[2024-10-03T18:44:25] puneDir: Kes
[2024-10-03T18:44:32] puneDir: <photos/photo_18149@03-10-2024_18-44-32.jpg>
[2024-10-03T18:47:30] Yamal: you have won but it was downhill punedir zidane
[2024-10-03T18:48:23] Face de Pin Sucé: Haha especially because we are racers in federation, we can not post this type of videos on street
[2024-10-03T18:48:51] Face de Pin Sucé: Haha we made our own motor, it's faster and torquer than opponents
[2024-10-03T18:48:58] haku: get that grey lanfiete frame. it looks cool
[2024-10-03T18:49:34] Yamal: Is comp happening in martial arts? If you use them while you are federated, it is considered a "white weapon"
[2024-10-03T18:49:47] sombre_enfant: 🤥🤥
[2024-10-03T18:50:11] NetworkDir: bad trail also $$$$$
[2024-10-03T18:50:22] NetworkDir: i don't want invest for scooter again
[2024-10-03T18:50:45] haku: get something different but electric
[2024-10-03T18:51:06] Yamal: There are already French people working in LY?
[2024-10-03T18:51:29] NetworkDir: gasoline for ever :)
[2024-10-03T18:51:59] Andrei Albert: From photos it seems to be very custom made
[2024-10-03T18:52:05] haku: gas is good. the tech on electric stuff is just interesting
[2024-10-03T18:52:13] Yamal: Yes I know I see too
[2024-10-03T18:52:33] Yamal: Just let's see what he answers
[2024-10-03T18:52:33] Andrei Albert: When i saw the motors in think u can put a belt on it too😂
[2024-10-03T18:52:51] Andrei Albert: Im curious too
[2024-10-03T18:53:16] Yamal: looks like a silver iodine washing machine
[2024-10-03T18:53:49] Face de Pin Sucé: We made in our workshop for some parts, some others were machined, ..
[2024-10-03T18:54:13] haku: thats true. you have to keep it professional. but what if you say your scooter was stolen then that thief ran a speed test and gave it back to you. then post it
[2024-10-03T18:54:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Hahaha
[2024-10-03T18:55:42] Yamal: Well, they still have to work, they weren't the ones who won the championship. 🪩
[2024-10-03T18:56:19] Andrei Albert: They should
[2024-10-03T18:56:40] Yamal: Lambo lost the championship
[2024-10-03T18:57:59] Yamal: It would be good to know what motors/electronics and battery the winning e-scooter had
[2024-10-03T19:00:20] Face de Pin Sucé: Ambrosini motors RFP controllers RFP battery
[2024-10-03T19:00:56] Face de Pin Sucé: We had the most powerful scooter but we couldn't train on tracks before the last race (which we won)
[2024-10-03T19:01:11] Face de Pin Sucé: That's the game, having the best scooter doesn't mean you will win the championship
[2024-10-03T19:01:26] GABE: Real.
[2024-10-03T19:01:32] Face de Pin Sucé: Even the winner, Kilian, told that we had the best scooter x)
[2024-10-03T19:01:59] haku: driver skill plays a big role too. but having the best tuned scooter helps alot
[2024-10-03T19:02:18] Andrei Albert: Like in every other domain
[2024-10-03T19:02:36] GABE: Fast and furious
[2024-10-03T19:03:28] GABE: More chance to win with a slower scooter if you're insane.
[2024-10-03T19:04:07] Yamal: killian dances claque
[2024-10-03T19:04:11] GABE: fearless.
[2024-10-03T19:05:07] haku: track racing is a different beast compared to just straight lines. you have to know the apex of the corners and stuff like that. im too smooth brain to figure that out
[2024-10-03T19:05:14] GABE: Tech racism.
[2024-10-03T19:05:16] puneDir: That bike is 125cc
[2024-10-03T19:05:20] puneDir: No luck near zero
[2024-10-03T19:06:50] puneDir: @jamessoderstrom
[2024-10-03T19:07:17] haku: you have to learn stuff like this in the track.
[2024-10-03T19:07:41] GABE: Essentially you have to know physics and math lolz
[2024-10-03T19:07:42] Yamal: Your mini bike really try out side or not yet
[2024-10-03T19:07:55] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-10-03T19:08:27] GABE: 160kmh?
[2024-10-03T19:08:32] puneDir: Yes
[2024-10-03T19:08:41] puneDir: He maded 160 gps on that ride
[2024-10-03T19:08:56] haku: havent yet. waiting on temporary bag and some qs8. should be arriving this week. but the rear brake and battery lock is still being sent out
[2024-10-03T19:08:56] GABE: Would be impossible with bigger motors
[2024-10-03T19:09:01] puneDir: Thing is faster than mt07 in 0-140
[2024-10-03T19:09:03] Yamal: Wouh 🔥🔥!Venon Man😂
[2024-10-03T19:09:05] puneDir: No its not?
[2024-10-03T19:09:11] GABE: How many kw
[2024-10-03T19:09:11] puneDir: Volkan 🤜🤛
[2024-10-03T19:09:14] puneDir: 50+
[2024-10-03T19:09:19] GABE: Is that yours?
[2024-10-03T19:09:20] Yamal: I like !!!
[2024-10-03T19:09:24] puneDir: No volkans
[2024-10-03T19:09:25] GABE: Ah thought that was your zeroo
[2024-10-03T19:09:28] GABE: I was like
[2024-10-03T19:09:29] puneDir: No lol
[2024-10-03T19:09:31] puneDir: Gps
[2024-10-03T19:09:43] puneDir: He also have the dragger record 😃

[2024-10-03T19:10:34] puneDir: It really makes that speed
[2024-10-03T19:10:43] GABE: The video cuts a bit

[2024-10-03T19:11:17] GABE: I mean dual 70h should do that for sure right
[2024-10-03T19:11:20] GABE: 160

[2024-10-03T19:11:38] puneDir: 24s
[2024-10-03T19:11:49] GABE: i believe he said 24s20p so basically infinite amps
[2024-10-03T19:11:59] puneDir: 250sr on beginning also was racing
[2024-10-03T19:11:59] haku: im coming for the world title boys. after i make my battery and lord james tunes the shit out of it
[2024-10-03T19:12:09] puneDir: And eve 40pl
[2024-10-03T19:12:11] Yamal: If he get 166/167 display is really 160 gps..
[2024-10-03T19:12:18] puneDir: 75a discharge per cell
[2024-10-03T19:12:59] puneDir: I want 200kmh zero
[2024-10-03T19:13:01] GABE: with 24s that 160 should be without fwk, right?
[2024-10-03T19:13:09] puneDir: Theres 100a fwk
[2024-10-03T19:13:10] GABE: 33x2 time
[2024-10-03T19:13:11] puneDir: 50-50
[2024-10-03T19:13:14] Yamal: Langfeite superior just nice
[2024-10-03T19:13:40] haku: what magnet size and winding on that motor?
[2024-10-03T19:14:00] Yamal: No need gloves 😂
[2024-10-03T19:14:23] Face de Pin Sucé: Hard to believe, maybe with 13 inch and field weakening and 24S ?
[2024-10-03T19:15:33] Yamal: The Turks dethrone you brother!!!🔥😂
[2024-10-03T19:15:34] NetworkDir: i fixed the display but magnet counts wrong in normal this scooter have 40 but i set 30 :) so 39% of speed is wrong 165km/h = 100km/h
[2024-10-03T19:16:03] NetworkDir: but 120km/h gps is last record
[2024-10-03T19:16:37] NetworkDir: yeah
[2024-10-03T19:16:41] NetworkDir: max i say 140-150
[2024-10-03T19:16:42] Face de Pin Sucé: For me, all scooter with more than 11inch are not interesting as they are not escooter as we know, it's more like sit scooters, and speeds must be more than 200Kmh or no point of having those size tyres
[2024-10-03T19:17:13] NetworkDir: punedir always say bullshit and crap
[2024-10-03T19:17:18] haku: agreed
[2024-10-03T19:17:29] Face de Pin Sucé: And also, 160Kmh feels a little bit faster on video, but it depends so much of angle that cannot really say
[2024-10-03T19:17:42] NetworkDir: he will change to x ltd cst tires
[2024-10-03T19:17:51] NetworkDir: 7 rim moment:
[2024-10-03T19:17:51] Face de Pin Sucé: Oh okay haha
[2024-10-03T19:18:03] GABE: Only reason I decided for 11". Safety is #1 priority.
[2024-10-03T19:18:10] Yamal: 120? .. :(
[2024-10-03T19:18:25] puneDir: Volkan said it makes 150
[2024-10-03T19:18:35] puneDir: 160 might be true too
[2024-10-03T19:18:36] Face de Pin Sucé: We worked a lot to limit tyre size to 11inch on our federation so everything that is bigger, for me has no point
[2024-10-03T19:18:43] puneDir: Its fixed
[2024-10-03T19:18:53] NetworkDir: i fixed yes
[2024-10-03T19:18:55] GABE: That's average for 20s6p moli on G30
[2024-10-03T19:19:04] GABE: with 60/65h
[2024-10-03T19:19:06] GABE: right?
[2024-10-03T19:19:08] NetworkDir: accurate with gps
[2024-10-03T19:19:09] puneDir: It makes more
[2024-10-03T19:19:16] puneDir: Volkan said he maded 150 today
[2024-10-03T19:19:19] GABE: with 22x3?
[2024-10-03T19:19:30] puneDir: Idk its prob 70h
[2024-10-03T19:19:41] Yamal: I can do 125 with 22/3 and 20s …….
[2024-10-03T19:19:45] puneDir: Equal
[2024-10-03T19:19:48] GABE: With 6p and only 1.8kwh that would discharge like a Bugatti veyron at peak HP.
[2024-10-03T19:19:57] NetworkDir: i dont fixed odometer lol because very shitty coded maybe do little bit more or low for odo
[2024-10-03T19:20:11] GABE: 20kw / 2kw
[2024-10-03T19:20:15] GABE: 6 min
[2024-10-03T19:20:20] GABE: 1/10 of an hour
[2024-10-03T19:20:53] Andrei Albert: Me too, with 70h
[2024-10-03T19:21:10] Yamal: When you finish the monster ?
[2024-10-03T19:21:15] GABE: Literally Bugatti veyron discharge.
[2024-10-03T19:21:16] haku: dont you have 33x2?
[2024-10-03T19:21:31] Andrei Albert: Not with mine tho, my friend scooter
[2024-10-03T19:21:51] Andrei Albert: Work doesn’t let me, im relocated in other city now
[2024-10-03T19:21:57] Andrei Albert: So no work on the scooter
[2024-10-03T19:22:05] GABE: when you guys do such a run, how do you even get home????
[2024-10-03T19:22:10] GABE: You can't
[2024-10-03T19:22:27] Andrei Albert: Building highways to test them with my scooter haha
[2024-10-03T19:22:38] Andrei Albert: Mines yes
[2024-10-03T19:23:00] Yamal: <photos/photo_18153@03-10-2024_19-23-00.jpg>
[2024-10-03T19:26:05] NetworkDir: 136km/h gps last record but road ended :D
[2024-10-03T19:26:41] Yamal: It's funny Volkan, let's see if he does a GPS test, if he put LY 75/80h maybe another rooster would crow
[2024-10-03T19:26:50] Andrei Albert: Only @SibClimb can say
[2024-10-03T19:27:07] Face de Pin Sucé: We didn't push enough on CL350 on our side, but networkdir told me they push 330 phase amps, it's quite great for a 30S capable with 12 fets
[2024-10-03T19:27:25] Face de Pin Sucé: Past 160Kmh is another game x)
[2024-10-03T19:27:51] Yamal: has not yet been seen by GPS
[2024-10-03T19:29:00] Andrei Albert: So the max i should set its 350?
[2024-10-03T19:29:08] NetworkDir: 34kW isnt enough?
[2024-10-03T19:30:28] NetworkDir: yeah we push 330A phase and 170A batt also 100A fwk on 20KHz motor case 40-45C inside looks 60-65C max i think and ESC max 47C
[2024-10-03T19:30:44] NetworkDir: i know checking motor temp with case wrong but at all looks cold
[2024-10-03T19:31:32] Yamal: But why FW,,?
[2024-10-03T19:31:32] NetworkDir: Yeah true but first we would find road for test lol
[2024-10-03T19:31:59] NetworkDir: 22x3 :D without fw and 24s just do 108km/h at air
[2024-10-03T19:32:16] NetworkDir: he checked phases looks cold but yeah maybe cause drop and melt
[2024-10-03T19:32:17] GABE: during sun?
[2024-10-03T19:32:53] GABE: so the KV is 4kmh/1s?
[2024-10-03T19:33:10] haku: is that why ly uses those glassfiber stuff?
[2024-10-03T19:33:23] GABE: Only 11" right
[2024-10-03T19:33:26] Andrei Albert: Big ass cables
[2024-10-03T19:33:46] haku: makes sense now.
[2024-10-03T19:35:19] GABE: Not gonna say who did what but I've seen it in here.
[2024-10-03T19:35:30] Yamal: I really want to buy a couple of big LY engines.
[2024-10-03T19:35:49] Yamal: Where you buy ?
[2024-10-03T19:35:54] GABE: Always deleted immediately after.
[2024-10-03T19:35:55] Yamal: Your 70h
[2024-10-03T19:35:59] GABE: James.
[2024-10-03T19:36:20] Yamal: 🤯
[2024-10-03T19:36:32] Yamal: James have LY MOTOR?
[2024-10-03T19:36:38] Yamal: 🔥😂
[2024-10-03T19:37:15] GABE: Air cooled wires when
[2024-10-03T19:37:20] GABE: internal
[2024-10-03T19:37:21] puneDir: I want 4 motor zero
[2024-10-03T19:37:29] GABE: Digga you want a car
[2024-10-03T19:37:32] puneDir: @NetworkDir give your motors
[2024-10-03T19:37:43] NetworkDir: buy it
[2024-10-03T19:37:51] GABE: What I want is an Ultra high powered E-Quad.
[2024-10-03T19:38:06] GABE: Has anyone even done that????
[2024-10-03T19:38:16] NetworkDir: Because with abusing 12kW on zero motors he will burn they :D
[2024-10-03T19:38:49] haku: didnt you already had one?
[2024-10-03T19:39:12] Yamal: No..
[2024-10-03T19:39:14] haku: @jamaludin_algarnati the lord of gifts
[2024-10-03T19:39:14] Andrei Albert: <photos/photo_18154@03-10-2024_19-39-14.jpg>
[2024-10-03T19:39:29] GABE: You?
[2024-10-03T19:39:35] GABE: Wait are those hubs?
[2024-10-03T19:39:43] Andrei Albert: Nah, one of my friends
[2024-10-03T19:39:46] GABE: I was thinking of internal driveshaft 4wd.
[2024-10-03T19:39:50] GABE: still insane
[2024-10-03T19:39:56] Andrei Albert: I don’t have time to build my own scooter
[2024-10-03T19:40:04] Andrei Albert: Yes
[2024-10-03T19:40:05] haku: qs205 hubs?
[2024-10-03T19:40:18] GABE: I can only imagine the cost.
[2024-10-03T19:40:26] Andrei Albert: I think, he started 2 years ago
[2024-10-03T19:40:27] Yamal: My motors are old generation, I don't know if they are ly but the phases are barely 4mm thin,
[2024-10-03T19:40:32] GABE: can those push like 200kw or something?
[2024-10-03T19:40:32] Andrei Albert: But no finished
[2024-10-03T19:40:39] GABE: 50 each
[2024-10-03T19:40:49] haku: yes nami is ly motor i think
[2024-10-03T19:41:05] NetworkDir: for 200kw 30s10p 40pl needed lol
[2024-10-03T19:41:14] Yamal: My no is Nami
[2024-10-03T19:41:14] NetworkDir: also how this frame would handle 200kw
[2024-10-03T19:41:35] GABE: KW in speed, not torque.
[2024-10-03T19:41:37] Andrei Albert: He wanted to get like 50 kw total
[2024-10-03T19:41:39] Yamal: <photos/photo_18155@03-10-2024_19-41-39.jpg>
[2024-10-03T19:41:51] GABE: Asked 10000 times but how does this motor work with holes
[2024-10-03T19:41:54] GABE: it should clog immediately
[2024-10-03T19:42:02] haku: the one you gifted is nami ly motors
[2024-10-03T19:42:13] Yamal: This yes

[2024-10-03T19:42:34] Yamal: Nami 60h 17/4 My 60h 22/3
[2024-10-03T19:42:35] GABE: @jamessoderstrom
[2024-10-03T19:42:58] Yamal: ?
[2024-10-03T19:43:01] haku: racing guys do that they drill holes
[2024-10-03T19:43:16] haku: not for street use ofcourse
[2024-10-03T19:43:17] Yamal: This motor is like this ..
[2024-10-03T19:43:27] Yamal: For fresh? 😂
[2024-10-03T19:43:36] GABE: should drill on both sides and add fins to push air.
[2024-10-03T19:43:42] GABE: Absolute ventilation then
[2024-10-03T19:43:54] haku: i think thats what they do
[2024-10-03T19:44:21] Yamal: I want 75h 33/2
[2024-10-03T19:44:24] GABE: That has to increase kw by like 30%
[2024-10-03T19:44:33] GABE: surely
[2024-10-03T19:46:12] haku: where do you come up with these numbers.
[2024-10-03T19:46:57] Yamal: <photos/photo_18156@03-10-2024_19-46-57.jpg>
[2024-10-03T19:47:10] haku: how you calculate that
[2024-10-03T19:47:12] GABE: just imagine it
[2024-10-03T19:47:47] haku: maybe santa will drop 1 off your chimney if you a good boy
[2024-10-03T19:48:44] Andrei Albert: Why not 80
[2024-10-03T19:49:17] puneDir: Where can i find 100h
[2024-10-03T19:49:30] haku: how come i never hear of 80h being used much in racing. always 75h
[2024-10-03T19:49:34] Andrei Albert: Ly has 130
[2024-10-03T19:49:51] haku: just get 2 qs motors dam
[2024-10-03T19:49:52] Yamal: and we hope that the 3 wise men bring me the rim cnc tubeles
[2024-10-03T19:50:01] Andrei Albert: Better kv i think
[2024-10-03T19:50:37] Yamal: I like 75h number
[2024-10-03T19:50:43] Yamal: Hehe
[2024-10-03T19:50:52] Yamal: 7 always
[2024-10-03T19:51:12] Andrei Albert: Lottery numbers 😆
[2024-10-03T19:52:42] haku: santa needs to drop this in my porch. i have no chimney.
[2024-10-03T19:52:46] Yamal: From the beginning I liked the 75h, the problem is that the Chinese don't want to work to give it to you with an opening of 155, and it will be necessary to space out the swingarms
[2024-10-03T19:53:06] Yamal: Mini bike can fit ?
[2024-10-03T19:53:24] haku: yes. if i extend the rear swing arm
[2024-10-03T19:53:41] haku: or get a real bike frame
[2024-10-03T19:54:26] Yamal: Like Fiido?
[2024-10-03T19:54:55] haku: no. big moped or bike frame
[2024-10-03T19:55:39] Yamal: It's impressive what the Thais do with mopeds
[2024-10-03T19:55:56] haku: it is. crazy moped culture in asia
[2024-10-03T19:55:59] Yamal: in sandals and with anti-blizzard glasses
[2024-10-03T19:56:02] Andrei Albert: The crazy af
[2024-10-03T19:56:57] haku: that electric moped is also becoming a thing in the US
[2024-10-03T19:57:08] Yamal: Now I'm telling you, to go on a moped I prefer to go in a van brother
[2024-10-03T19:57:45] Yamal: e-scooter forever
[2024-10-03T19:58:14] Yamal: I see that in America scooters and motors get along well, right?
[2024-10-03T19:58:46] haku: yea.
[2024-10-03T19:58:58] Yamal: There is a good community, but they want to screw you! for the children surron!
[2024-10-03T19:59:27] haku: yep. alot of surrons here
[2024-10-03T19:59:50] haku: if you want to get in the pev buisness you have to know about them
[2024-10-03T20:00:07] Yamal: What is the best state in America to enjoy your e-scooter?
[2024-10-03T20:00:36] haku: not in mine for sure. its too hot and dusty. prolly california
[2024-10-03T20:00:51] haku: great weather all the time
[2024-10-03T20:01:04] Yamal: Nice
[2024-10-03T20:01:47] Yamal: The laws are the same for everyone, I imagine.
[2024-10-03T20:02:14] haku: every state has different laws on pevs. some strict some not
[2024-10-03T20:02:53] Noname: Aww your buying me a gift
[2024-10-03T20:03:19] Face de Pin Sucé: If only you knew where this picture comes from 😂
[2024-10-03T20:03:28] haku: in my city if your battery doesnt overheat in the sun and explode or you will die in a heat stroke
[2024-10-03T20:03:29] Yamal: Your home ?
[2024-10-03T20:03:42] haku: i was hoping you do 😭
[2024-10-03T20:04:07] Noname: Split it and I'll take odd weekends
[2024-10-03T20:05:31] Noname: What's the torque spec.on that? My 70h is 230ft/lb and my truck is 240ft/lb of torque.
[2024-10-03T20:05:31] Face de Pin Sucé: This was our second order after corrections made to the motors, back in 2021, had a huge argument with factory because after that they started to sell to chinese resellers on aliexpress with the pictures from our orders x) If you look closely, you will see Rage Mechanics engraved haha
[2024-10-03T20:07:21] Yamal: but those photos are not from Aliexpress, they are from our favorite Chinese friend
[2024-10-03T20:07:42] Yamal: By the way, is the slack finished?
[2024-10-03T20:07:46] haku: no idea. but that one moped you showed me before is using this for sure
[2024-10-03T20:08:32] Face de Pin Sucé: They were initially posted on AliExpress x)
[2024-10-03T20:08:58] Face de Pin Sucé: Very soon, we did some test and need to make some adjustments and finish the aesthetic

[2024-10-03T20:10:14] Yamal: Very nice , still 20s?
[2024-10-03T20:11:04] Yamal: For me I like slack frame …..
[2024-10-03T20:11:26] haku: thats not titanium yea?
[2024-10-03T20:11:27] Yamal: Weped too
[2024-10-03T20:12:55] Face de Pin Sucé: It's very BIG SHIT fork, suspension, frame, I truly hate everything on this scooter, and even more after took it on road
[2024-10-03T20:12:56] haku: yea that raw titanium look is nice
[2024-10-03T20:13:11] Face de Pin Sucé: Some parts are titanium yes
[2024-10-03T20:13:24] Face de Pin Sucé: Please don't say it's beautiful let me show you
[2024-10-03T20:14:23] Face de Pin Sucé: <video_file>
[2024-10-03T20:14:23] Noname: Lil less torque but 2x the speed
[2024-10-03T20:14:31] haku: yea kinda reminds me of laotie
[2024-10-03T20:15:16] haku: can you smooth that out atleast?
[2024-10-03T20:15:21] Yamal: Numooooooo
[2024-10-03T20:15:28] Face de Pin Sucé: <video_file>
[2024-10-03T20:16:44] haku: the surron in the back. i wonder what greatness rage mechanics done to it
[2024-10-03T20:16:53] Face de Pin Sucé: <video_file>
[2024-10-03T20:17:09] NetworkDir: lmfao looks zero have a better quality than slack
[2024-10-03T20:17:19] Face de Pin Sucé: That would take hours and need a new painting, and still be weak as fuck
[2024-10-03T20:17:58] Face de Pin Sucé: <video_file>
[2024-10-03T20:18:31] NetworkDir: wtf😂
[2024-10-03T20:18:57] Yamal: Very sad
[2024-10-03T20:19:03] NetworkDir: big sad
[2024-10-03T20:19:05] NetworkDir: for 7000euro
[2024-10-03T20:19:06] NetworkDir: xD
[2024-10-03T20:19:06] Yamal: Long time I like slack
[2024-10-03T20:19:47] Face de Pin Sucé: And trust me, I'm really not confident on this, use to the RM-X, I corner much more with RM-X, and even I have been able to touch the front fork on a corner, this Slack is just a scam, should be sold 4000€ not 8900€ as announced
[2024-10-03T20:21:25] Face de Pin Sucé: Basically the chassis is titanium
[2024-10-03T20:21:25] Yamal: Likewise, I think that Slack Factory is a bit dead.
[2024-10-03T20:22:30] GABE: UnIronically just imagine Windings having direct cooling
[2024-10-03T20:22:38] Face de Pin Sucé: <video_file>
[2024-10-03T20:22:44] Yamal: Nami is overwhelming the Korean scooters xD
[2024-10-03T20:23:22] GABE: Stalium
[2024-10-03T20:23:24] GABE: nice word for steel
[2024-10-03T20:23:32] GABE: French is fancy
[2024-10-03T20:23:39] GABE: I love the word.
[2024-10-03T20:23:41] Yamal: by the way dualtron korea, which they say is korean but it is more chinese than the rice three delicacies
[2024-10-03T20:24:07] Yamal: Weped why
[2024-10-03T20:24:10] NetworkDir: they write Designed by korea
[2024-10-03T20:25:28] Yamal: The new weped is crazy I think
[2024-10-03T20:25:44] Yamal: Sonic/sonic x
[2024-10-03T20:25:57] Face de Pin Sucé: Rage Mechanics won't fail 🙈
[2024-10-03T20:26:34] Yamal: Where is the 33kw weped
[2024-10-03T20:26:42] Face de Pin Sucé: Weped is shit
[2024-10-03T20:27:08] Face de Pin Sucé: Only Weped Fold 3 has a good riding, precise, but it's still plates screwed together so will never be right
[2024-10-03T20:27:38] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, with 20S9P 50E battery with BMS no temp sensor, 60H 33x2 48KV haha I remember
[2024-10-03T20:28:16] Face de Pin Sucé: For the record, first 75H in the world were installed on a SST at Rage Mechanics
[2024-10-03T20:28:20] Face de Pin Sucé: 7218S
[2024-10-03T20:29:14] Face de Pin Sucé: https://youtu.be/VCvH_Gem0R8?si=iiUJ32wgsWqNqMHa
[2024-10-03T20:29:17] Yamal: Which scooter factory use molicel /vtc6/ 40t cell………?
[2024-10-03T20:29:28] Face de Pin Sucé: That isn't completely trye
[2024-10-03T20:29:56] Face de Pin Sucé: Square shinko tyres are infinite grip, but it requires a lot of physic effort to take a good corner
[2024-10-03T20:30:29] Face de Pin Sucé: At 1.2bars, it was amazing on track, but you feel tired after 15mins full speed on track
[2024-10-03T20:32:03] Yamal: Velity / momen,,?
[2024-10-03T20:33:15] Face de Pin Sucé: 😏🙈
[2024-10-03T20:33:32] Face de Pin Sucé: https://www.instagram.com/tv/CbdaEIlgN8E/?igsh=MWNucnU2NGlnMnd0dA== I loved when she was screaming like this
[2024-10-03T20:35:16] Yamal: Nice weped sst or gts
[2024-10-03T20:36:26] haku: this is why we buy alibaba frames. these "hyperscooters" are scams
[2024-10-03T20:39:36] haku: have you seen any standing scooters on fardriver controllers?
[2024-10-03T20:40:37] Face de Pin Sucé: Gts, because SST was too instable, thanks to it's length and design
[2024-10-03T20:40:49] Yamal: And if we talk about frames, make them really interesting to prepare what you would think they would be? excluding g30/thunder/nami
[2024-10-03T20:40:50] Face de Pin Sucé: Weped fold 3 has far drivers
[2024-10-03T20:41:01] Yamal: Fold 3
[2024-10-03T20:41:07] Yamal: Is new or old?
[2024-10-03T20:41:09] haku: but not ly motors though
[2024-10-03T20:41:11] Face de Pin Sucé: You removed a lot of good ones 😂
[2024-10-03T20:41:17] Face de Pin Sucé: New
[2024-10-03T20:41:27] Face de Pin Sucé: Ly motor 60H 22/3
[2024-10-03T20:41:35] Yamal: One with the neck sonic?
[2024-10-03T20:41:41] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2024-10-03T20:41:46] Yamal: Nice
[2024-10-03T20:41:52] NetworkDir: inmotion rs - segway gt2 maybe
[2024-10-03T20:42:20] Face de Pin Sucé: Gt2 is trash also
[2024-10-03T20:42:34] Face de Pin Sucé: Inmotion RS seems all right but I never disassembled one
[2024-10-03T20:42:42] NetworkDir: why?
[2024-10-03T20:44:59] Face de Pin Sucé: Heavy as fuck, not much space, complicated to add big motors, 7inch rim if you keep original motors, not very strong front direction, I've seen some broke because it is a tube or something like that, pole is high and seems complicated to shorten, ... X)
[2024-10-03T20:45:41] GABE: I think cars have fake hp ratings as well.
[2024-10-03T20:45:59] GABE: some*
[2024-10-03T20:46:02] GABE: manufacturers
[2024-10-03T20:46:03] NetworkDir: yeah true ...
[2024-10-03T20:46:17] Yamal: But stability,, number 1 ONE
[2024-10-03T20:47:26] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, slack is really stable too, I release a hand at 90kmh no problem
[2024-10-03T20:47:52] NetworkDir: handlebar and stem looks poor
[2024-10-03T20:47:53] GABE: Hit the disposable going 90kmh
[2024-10-03T20:48:09] NetworkDir: i see 2-3x cracked handlebar and 2x fucked stem axle from bearings
[2024-10-03T20:49:30] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_18161@03-10-2024_20-49-30.jpg>

[2024-10-03T20:50:06] Face de Pin Sucé: No racing scooter with this please
[2024-10-03T20:50:26] NetworkDir: it's done with crash but at all shouldn't crack i think
[2024-10-03T20:50:27] Yamal: stability on scooters is très important
[2024-10-03T20:50:44] Face de Pin Sucé: <voice_message>
[2024-10-03T20:50:52] GABE: aren't these supposed to be the best
[2024-10-03T20:51:54] Face de Pin Sucé: Every scooter is supposed to be the best
[2024-10-03T20:52:10] NetworkDir: gt2 bit overrated
[2024-10-03T20:52:25] Yamal: You're on vacation?, I see you very active xD
[2024-10-03T20:59:31] Face de Pin Sucé: I've been on workshop since 9am, need to disconnect a little
[2024-10-03T20:59:54] Face de Pin Sucé: And I've finished some big urgent projects so I am able to release a little the pressure
[2024-10-03T21:01:16] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_18165@03-10-2024_21-01-16.jpg>
[2024-10-03T21:01:22] Face de Pin Sucé: This will also be very funny x)
[2024-10-03T21:01:51] Andrei Albert: Tell us something about ittt
[2024-10-03T21:04:13] haku: everyone knows g30 is the premiere racing scooter
[2024-10-03T21:04:32] haku: thats why im building one too
[2024-10-03T21:04:34] Face de Pin Sucé: 14S2P P45B 😂
[2024-10-03T21:04:37] Finn: <photos/photo_18166@03-10-2024_21-04-37.jpg>
[2024-10-03T21:04:45] Finn: Do eve 40p
[2024-10-03T21:04:49] Finn: Cheaper
[2024-10-03T21:05:01] Lisa: @ESt1ft would say Bad lifetime
[2024-10-03T21:05:07] Lisa: But uses it himself
[2024-10-03T21:05:12] Finn: Fuck lifetime
[2024-10-03T21:05:26] Finn: Its not relevant
[2024-10-03T21:06:07] Finn: If you go by specs and use the cells as intendet its not noticable
[2024-10-03T21:07:41] Yamal: <video_file>
[2024-10-03T21:10:03] Face de Pin Sucé: Battery already made
[2024-10-03T21:10:49] haku: have you tested 40pl yet?
[2024-10-03T21:11:41] Face de Pin Sucé: Nope
[2024-10-03T21:12:05] haku: james has em if you want to try it out.
[2024-10-03T21:12:30] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes we discussed about it already
[2024-10-03T21:12:35] Face de Pin Sucé: I also can buy some
[2024-10-03T21:12:44] Face de Pin Sucé: But too many projects together
[2024-10-03T21:15:14] Yamal: But what it’s the brand cell?
[2024-10-03T21:15:22] Lisa: Eve
[2024-10-03T21:16:21] Yamal: I only now Samsung , molicel and Chinese cell xD..
[2024-10-03T21:16:29] Yamal: Lg..
[2024-10-03T21:16:59] Yamal: Vtc6 is Sony?
[2024-10-03T21:17:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2024-10-03T21:18:19] Yamal: Sound nice
[2024-10-03T21:18:22] Yamal: Vtc6
[2024-10-03T21:18:32] Yamal: Is like cool
[2024-10-03T21:20:40] Yamal: a few hours of waiting... there are no trees here to rest for a while xD
[2024-10-03T21:21:08] haku: are you renting a scooter there?
[2024-10-03T21:22:53] Yamal: right now I'm like a hobbit in lindon
[2024-10-03T21:23:06] Yamal: I’m just in Madrid
[2024-10-03T21:23:27] Yamal: I arrived at my destination on Saturday morning
[2024-10-03T21:24:12] Yamal: No there are ,,, prohibited
[2024-10-03T21:39:28] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: finished this face
[2024-10-03T21:45:06] haku: can it pull 45a
[2024-10-03T21:46:35] haku: how long can pl do it
[2024-10-03T21:47:37] haku: pl can prolly do 45 continious
[2024-10-03T21:48:16] haku: just talking out of my butt. but the hype is real
[2024-10-03T21:48:25] Yamal: But eve is a good brand ?
[2024-10-03T21:48:58] haku: i beleive they are one of chinas best brand
[2024-10-03T21:49:31] Yamal: OhH from China 👍
[2024-10-03T21:49:46] haku: pl will complete my i love china theme
[2024-10-03T21:50:05] haku: but i already have cells
[2024-10-03T21:50:11] Yamal: Expensive cell?
[2024-10-03T21:50:30] Yamal: Pl I mean
[2024-10-03T21:50:37] haku: yes atm. in america atleast
[2024-10-03T21:51:41] haku: if i get pls i will also need new vescs or fardrivers too expensive. i havent even tested mine yet
[2024-10-03T21:53:09] haku: only person i know that makes good pl packs is james atm
[2024-10-03T21:54:15] Yamal: And what is the difference in discharge of p42a and pl?
[2024-10-03T21:54:43] haku: @jamessoderstrom is it big difference?
[2024-10-03T21:55:16] haku: its like double i think
[2024-10-03T21:55:18] Yamal: Hey man taxi Tesla
[2024-10-03T21:55:46] Yamal: <photos/photo_18168@03-10-2024_21-55-46.jpg>
[2024-10-03T21:55:48] haku: smart to have a tesla taxi
[2024-10-03T21:56:59] Lisa: 45A to 70A But they advertise 100A but on datasheet it’s 70A I believe
[2024-10-03T21:58:19] Yamal: So 10p is 700 A 🔥😂
[2024-10-03T21:58:34] Yamal: Seven!!! Where are you???
[2024-10-03T21:58:35] haku: yea boy. but only 4ah cells
[2024-10-03T21:58:59] Yamal: It’s okay
[2024-10-03T21:59:08] Yamal: Same I have now in 40t
[2024-10-03T21:59:09] haku: agreed.
[2024-10-03T21:59:54] haku: when will korean/ western battery makers produce something similar to pl. china is killing it
[2024-10-03T22:00:45] haku: and when will tesla release the 4860 cell. would be good to see
[2024-10-03T22:03:30] Yamal: <photos/photo_18169@03-10-2024_22-03-30.jpg>
[2024-10-03T22:04:36] haku: chonker
[2024-10-03T22:06:07] haku: would be cool to see someone use that cell in a build.
[2024-10-03T22:06:41] haku: it has to be america theme build though
[2024-10-03T22:07:40] Lisa: @ESt1ft would say 4680 have too low lifetime
[2024-10-03T22:08:10] haku: is it? dont know anything about it
[2024-10-03T22:08:49] Lisa: Yea no idk too It’s a joke because he says that 40P Eve have low lifetime wich is basically right but uses them in his own build
[2024-10-03T22:08:53] Lisa: It’s like am insider joke
[2024-10-03T22:10:09] Patrick: I said it one time to 40P because its true...
[2024-10-03T22:10:22] Patrick: The Cell has a shit lifetime
[2024-10-03T22:11:17] Lisa: @Bradhaku you see
[2024-10-03T22:11:21] Lisa: Always knowing better
[2024-10-03T22:11:39] Lisa: 🤣🤣
[2024-10-03T22:14:10] Yamal: But pl same?
[2024-10-03T22:14:20] Yamal: Short life time
[2024-10-03T22:14:58] Patrick: Is there even a datasheet available right now? Never found one
[2024-10-03T22:16:20] GABE: If you drain at stable amps, eg 90a cont, sure. Just cause it can do it CONT doesn't mean it = same lifetime.
[2024-10-03T22:16:25] GABE: Just means it can do it.
[2024-10-03T22:16:35] GABE: and not heat I believe
[2024-10-03T22:17:37] GABE: It's like Molicel has like 500 cycles apparently
[2024-10-03T22:17:39] Yamal: <photos/photo_18170@03-10-2024_22-17-39.jpg>
[2024-10-03T22:18:12] GABE: Need...
[2024-10-03T22:18:31] GABE: Do you only use one ketchup?
[2024-10-03T22:18:39] GABE: One for the burger also is good
[2024-10-03T22:18:49] Patrick: 30A discharge and after 300cycles only 60% capacity left is shit even on lower discharge...
[2024-10-03T22:18:54] Yamal: They only put one… it’s okay😂🔥
[2024-10-03T22:19:14] GABE: Why does that happen
[2024-10-03T22:19:21] GABE: surely high charge rate?
[2024-10-03T22:19:33] haku: how far do i have to smear the paste?
[2024-10-03T22:20:09] GABE: You all violate your cells with fast charging I know that
[2024-10-03T22:20:57] Patrick: Yes fast charge but it changes nothing p42a as example still have a way better lifetime...
[2024-10-03T22:21:06] Patrick: Even if you charge fast
[2024-10-03T22:21:37] GABE: I'll never charge more than at 5a
[2024-10-03T22:21:42] GABE: Literally no need for more.
[2024-10-03T22:21:54] GABE: Just charge before bed..
[2024-10-03T22:22:04] GABE: Cell is like 20ah what more do you need
[2024-10-03T22:22:05] Patrick: Literally doesnt change the fact that lifetime of 40P is shit compared to other cells
[2024-10-03T22:22:30] GABE: god awful, feels like driving a disposable vape then.
[2024-10-03T22:22:38] Patrick: Cheap but shit lifetime
[2024-10-03T22:22:50] GABE: thought they were the best cells at the moment
[2024-10-03T22:22:59] Patrick: 40P?😂
[2024-10-03T22:23:51] Patrick: Yes still like it price is good if you need "high" discharge for cheap
[2024-10-03T22:23:51] GABE: Those 90a cells make no sense to me because using their real power, you'll just discharge them in a 2 minute run.
[2024-10-03T22:24:00] GABE: their amperage makes no sense with 2170
[2024-10-03T22:24:19] GABE: don't get the reason behind them.
[2024-10-03T22:24:46] Patrick: The current is more for torque is my guess
[2024-10-03T22:25:35] Patrick: Interesting for E formula same like the new molicels
[2024-10-03T22:25:35] GABE: I don't think you can get more torque physically
[2024-10-03T22:26:17] haku: anyone have a good stl in ly phase cable holders?
[2024-10-03T22:26:44] GABE: True, light is the only valid reason to use these cells.
[2024-10-03T22:27:12] Patrick: Not sure how e formula cars are build up my guess is they use a higher voltage so the high discharge cells make sense
[2024-10-03T22:27:15] GABE: It's nice to have ultra high discharge cells that aren't LIPO, aswell.
[2024-10-03T22:27:31] GABE: well, compared to lipo they aren't that good
[2024-10-03T22:27:41] Patrick: Lipo G30 battery🔥
[2024-10-03T22:27:44] haku: theres uses for it. electric drag races
[2024-10-03T22:27:59] GABE: If you're focusing on such cells, disposability is like, a fact. The racer people should just use LIPO
[2024-10-03T22:28:05] GABE: Weight would be even less
[2024-10-03T22:28:31] Patrick: A crash with lipos is way worse then with liion probably
[2024-10-03T22:28:40] GABE: Shits the same
[2024-10-03T22:29:11] GABE: sure Ion has armour but the heat will blow every other cell anyways
[2024-10-03T22:29:21] GABE: Like dynamite.
[2024-10-03T22:29:35] Patrick: Liion cells still have some saftey vents etc and the cells get fucked in the races so makes sense to use liion instead of lipos
[2024-10-03T22:29:57] haku: do i just use a small dot in the middle like a cpu? 😭
[2024-10-03T22:30:11] haku: <photos/photo_18172@03-10-2024_22-30-11.jpg>
[2024-10-03T22:30:28] GABE: Keep in mind LIPOS are never stressed ever.
[2024-10-03T22:31:22] GABE: They wouldn't get fucked in races or heat at all.
[2024-10-03T22:31:42] Yamal: LIPOSolution?
[2024-10-03T22:31:57] GABE: Trash unless you have government funding like F1 or whatever
[2024-10-03T22:32:05] GABE: Cause then you can just get more
[2024-10-03T22:33:13] Yamal: And the g30 is already with one of the two eyes open?
[2024-10-03T22:33:51] GABE: whose g30
[2024-10-03T22:34:15] Yamal: Yours
[2024-10-03T22:34:35] Yamal: 70h/g30/mp2 performance
[2024-10-03T22:34:50] Yamal: Really October
[2024-10-03T22:34:53] Yamal: Wohooo
[2024-10-03T22:34:57] Yamal: Hehe
[2024-10-03T22:34:57] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-03T22:35:00] Pandalgns: Como te pones 😂😂 like a kiko 😂😂
[2024-10-03T22:35:14] GABE: 4 weeks...
[2024-10-03T22:37:31] Yamal: Put more man…

[2024-10-03T22:39:54] GABE: I will be assembling that shit immediately as soon as I get my stuff.
[2024-10-03T22:40:05] GABE: I won't even be thinking about food.
[2024-10-03T22:40:54] Yamal: THE END , Wich esc?

[2024-10-03T22:41:47] Yamal: Nice
[2024-10-03T22:42:00] GABE: I don't want anything blowing so why not oversize everything
[2024-10-03T22:42:22] NetworkDir: what about mp2 mini anyone tested?
[2024-10-03T22:42:42] GABE: Want it to be like a car.
[2024-10-03T22:42:52] Yamal: Same 18 seven/ or g300 right ?
[2024-10-03T22:42:56] GABE: I've had enough of shit blowing.
[2024-10-03T22:43:19] GABE: unsure what you mean. It's a v0.3
[2024-10-03T22:43:35] Yamal: I mean all have 18 fet……..
[2024-10-03T22:44:27] GABE: mp2 mini is 6fet iirc
[2024-10-03T22:44:33] Yamal: <photos/photo_18173@03-10-2024_22-44-33.jpg>

[2024-10-03T22:51:40] Patrick: 2x seven & ant 850A
[2024-10-03T22:52:18] GABE: As in I don't want it to stop working
[2024-10-03T22:52:27] haku: gotcha
[2024-10-03T22:52:35] GABE: As reliable as a Toyota
[2024-10-03T22:52:42] GABE: my dad's has 100k and nothing broke
[2024-10-03T22:52:49] haku: you dont like exploding fets?
[2024-10-03T22:53:17] haku: its kinda like how you get blowback from a car. sounds the same haha
[2024-10-03T22:53:21] Andrei Albert: Still going strong😂😂😂
[2024-10-03T22:53:54] haku: toyotas and hondas the best
[2024-10-03T22:54:12] GABE: Ecar conversion will not happen with me for a good fucking while. The G30 project has taken 80% of my yearly salary.
[2024-10-03T22:54:29] GABE: when I graduate and possibly be an engineer I'll look into funding that
[2024-10-03T22:54:32] haku: g30 is like the corolla of scooters
[2024-10-03T22:54:47] GABE: yeah lol
[2024-10-03T22:54:50] haku: so much stuff you can do to it and still keep it stock and be great

[2024-10-03T22:56:04] GABE: I'll be that kind of engineer that straight up says on my resume "If your company will require me to program code, I respectfully decline your acception to me working at your company"
[2024-10-03T22:56:19] GABE: I'd rather work at a plant.
[2024-10-03T22:56:35] GABE: My friend does, he likes it.
[2024-10-03T22:56:47] GABE: Electrical plant.

[2024-10-03T22:58:05] GABE: Just don't take any Adderall or you'll weld the entire cell upside down and then proceed to mix up positive and negative
[2024-10-03T22:58:07] Yamal: Nice
[2024-10-03T22:58:11] haku: also i swore an oath to lord james. i cant break that

[2024-10-03T23:04:41] haku: just 1 and a extra magazine is enough
[2024-10-03T23:04:45] GABE: If my ride got grabbed id literally hunt them down
[2024-10-03T23:04:55] GABE: I'd go clinically insane
[2024-10-03T23:05:11] GABE: I'd go knock on every hood house with a gun in my hand
[2024-10-03T23:05:37] GABE: There are people who do that here after their motorbikes get stolen. If you steal off the wrong guy he will post a story and say "whoever finds this guy will get paid 5000" and the entire mafia of Dublin will be after you.

[2024-10-04T01:21:55] haku: or whatever that side skirt is called
[2024-10-04T01:22:09] Yamal: I need to charge 1%!!
[2024-10-04T01:24:41] Yamal: here in Spain parts of everything are taken from the cow
[2024-10-04T01:27:58] Yamal: <animation>
[2024-10-04T01:28:40] Yamal: E-scooter is cool,! I tell you!
[2024-10-04T01:29:51] haku: that is crazy.
[2024-10-04T01:30:14] Yamal: Heheh😂🤣
[2024-10-04T01:31:56] Yamal: survives like can
[2024-10-04T01:32:40] haku: i would not attempt that with my kid.
[2024-10-04T01:33:41] Yamal: Imagine that you have to escape your city at all costs, wouldn't you do it?
[2024-10-04T01:34:23] Yamal: I would do it but off road
[2024-10-04T01:35:07] haku: yea not around cars.
[2024-10-04T01:36:13] Yamal: field wheels and backpack with water, nuts, dates and fig bread xD
[2024-10-04T01:42:02] Yamal: I want to test my fast charger on a long route, I only had time to test it at a small stop at 18A in the morning, the same day at night the controller exploded
[2024-10-04T01:42:32] Yamal: 20A I think is perfect for long route
[2024-10-04T01:43:06] haku: i need one. i only have 5a
[2024-10-04T01:43:13] haku: its so expensive
[2024-10-04T01:43:46] Yamal: 100
[2024-10-04T01:44:05] haku: its 200 nowadays
[2024-10-04T01:44:06] Yamal: Fast charger is the 🗝
[2024-10-04T01:44:57] Noname: And 2nd battery
[2024-10-04T01:45:43] Yamal: I was able to do 400km in a weekend with a 10A charger. Can you imagine if I carried the new charger? without a doubt it has been the route of this summer par excellence, I went alone, but the I enjoyed a lot
[2024-10-04T01:46:23] Noname: Damn that's a lot of riding
[2024-10-04T01:46:50] Yamal: With 40ah
[2024-10-04T01:47:14] Noname: Lot of charging too
[2024-10-04T01:48:18] Yamal: charge 2 times before reaching destination, and then leave the scooter charging slow at night and the Sunday back home with 2 stops too
[2024-10-04T01:50:20] Yamal: With a 40 ah battery I can do about 100km or so.It also depends if there are many hills and such because I have routes that I have done 100km and I have left over battery and others that I have arrived with very little battery.

[2024-10-05T22:21:03] Noname: Updates are just spread around, becomes an Easter egg hunt. The light board update was bugged and locked me in reverse. I said there's a prob and then need another update. Meanwhile I cut wires to bypass and forgot power was on. Clicky menu is a pain, jumbo sized controllers.Company is limited so suspended repairs. Hard to get anyway.
[2024-10-05T22:21:48] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: @punedir with bigger tire don't I lose performance?

[2024-10-06T00:05:17] Happy Giraffe: Was good? Can switch profiles? External speed sensor?😁
[2024-10-06T00:25:03] Happy Giraffe: With external speed sensor could make shimano nexus sleeper bikes with mid drive😁
[2024-10-06T00:46:43] haku: how do you guys attatch ebrake sensors to a regular brake handle?
[2024-10-06T00:51:25] haku: i need to make the vesc throttle stop working when applying ebrake. not for me for the peak g30 minibike
[2024-10-06T01:28:33] Happy Giraffe: Second throttle for adjustable regen or if mechanical disc then the lever that has a switch
[2024-10-06T01:34:25] haku: thats the thing i dont have a ebrake handle. i need to male regular brakes to be able to have ebrake sensor
[2024-10-06T01:35:39] haku: how do you guys put sensors on non e-brake brake levers?
[2024-10-06T01:40:58] NetworkDir: Simple switch
[2024-10-06T01:41:21] haku: how does that look like in a brake lever?
[2024-10-06T01:42:08] NetworkDir: Depend lever
[2024-10-06T01:43:24] NetworkDir: use spintend regen throttle or use 2x throttle right for current and left for brake
[2024-10-06T01:44:20] haku: its a regular kid brake levers.
[2024-10-06T01:44:54] NetworkDir: I think putting button would be hard maybe you need new lever

[2024-10-06T01:49:01] haku: what is voltage for ebrake is it 5v or 3.3?
[2024-10-06T01:49:29] haku: i might just use a simple button
[2024-10-06T02:03:07] haku: thats right i forgot about that. wich ports do i use for ebrake?
[2024-10-06T02:03:41] haku: thanks bro
[2024-10-06T02:05:35] Happy Giraffe: If you go for switches, why not get a handle that has them already. Maybe can find some smallers or modify the level
[2024-10-06T02:06:36] Happy Giraffe: Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! €10.99 | WUXING 115PDD Ebike Brake Lever Cut Off Power Electric Bicycle E-scooter Ebreak Waterproof SM Connector Plug https://a.aliexpress.com/_EuTofID

[2024-10-06T02:08:02] haku: kids hand tiny. i need to find kids size really small.

[2024-10-06T17:25:21] Rotatooor: I fried my controller. I'm not sure how. This was my first vesc controller (makerx m100). I installed it on an ebike with a geared hub motor. I did the motor and input setup, and it worked fine with no load. I took it for a test ride, it gave a brief initial push and then stopped working. I disconnected the battery cable, and checked the wiring but everything looked ok. When I reconnected the battery cable, it made a big spark and a good amount of black smoke came out the xt60. The controller never produced smoke but my guess is it's dead. I want to buy another controller but I must figure out what I did wrong. I don't want to burn another one. I think the vesc motor config set the phase amps to 70a. The controller is rated for 40a cont and 120a peak. I think I forgot to change the value to 40a. Could that be the reason it broke?
[2024-10-06T17:34:32] Yamal: What controller do you want to buy?
[2024-10-06T17:42:38] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 🤪
[2024-10-06T17:42:55] Rotatooor: I don't know. I'm not sure I want to mess with vesc again, tbh. If I don't figure out why the first one died, I'm afraid it will happen again.
[2024-10-06T17:45:19] sombre_enfant: Bet its too expensive for production with this design
[2024-10-06T17:59:49] sombre_enfant: Stock on 13s is the most reliable i had
[2024-10-06T18:38:35] GABE: What is the observer
[2024-10-06T18:59:48] Rotatooor: What controller would you recommend?
[2024-10-06T19:00:32] Rotatooor: Yeah, I didn't expect the thing to completely die
[2024-10-06T19:01:13] Yamal: UBOX 85/150 for the power you want to demand
[2024-10-06T19:04:26] Yamal: He is achieving medals and good fame with facts! For one that burned, 10 are stealing smiles from its owners, and I repeat, good fame is earned with facts and numbers on the table.
[2024-10-06T19:08:20] haku: what motor do you guys choose for geared hub on vesctool?
[2024-10-06T19:08:38] haku: small outrunner?
[2024-10-06T19:10:19] Rotatooor: Looks like it's unavailable
[2024-10-06T19:10:50] Rotatooor: What do you think of the flipsky 75100 pro V2?
[2024-10-06T19:12:29] Noname: Is that spintend website?
[2024-10-06T19:16:52] Yamal: Well, from what is said in the group, it is better to forget about Flipsky, poor quality first, and the last thing that has been heard in this group, that Flipsky has stopped being vesc because I don't know what stories about not paying "x" permits or what happy stories, now from the first moment I have never heard that flipsky is good electronics or that it uses good components in its construction...

[2024-10-06T20:57:35] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: You are brave with the slowing down I would not slow down like that on a highway with cars behind me
[2024-10-06T20:57:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes
[2024-10-06T20:58:09] GABE: Best.
[2024-10-06T20:58:58] Noname: On an antispark looks like there is a green line inside female. Is that a resistor connector before the main connection happens? Got a lil hot in there
[2024-10-06T21:03:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <animation>
[2024-10-06T21:05:39] Yamal: Total 120A?
[2024-10-06T21:06:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yep
[2024-10-06T21:06:30] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: U do know how to use a calculator Ill give you that 😉😉😉😉

[2024-10-06T21:13:15] Noname: Well those suck then 😆
[2024-10-06T21:14:05] puneDir: Less heat
[2024-10-06T21:15:13] NetworkDir: Why 80A phase?
[2024-10-06T21:17:46] puneDir: I did new settings i think they will fix my issue
[2024-10-06T21:22:19] Jansblog✨: Currently using the 85150 at 160A phase/ 120A batt. Abs. Max Amps 210A 25A Field weakening Heat at really abusing this ESC is max at 42 degrees C. With around 15 degrees outside
[2024-10-06T21:25:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Motors too hot
[2024-10-06T21:26:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: (After 1h drive with aggressive riding )
[2024-10-06T21:26:38] NetworkDir: 60A fwk should this reason ;)
[2024-10-06T21:26:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also the reason for the high speed
[2024-10-06T21:27:10] NetworkDir: you can reach to the "high speed" with more phase
[2024-10-06T21:27:20] NetworkDir: 80A low for 50A batt
[2024-10-06T21:27:39] NetworkDir: if with 120A phase and 50A batt your motors overheat something wrong with motors or controller
[2024-10-06T21:27:41] puneDir: <video_file>
[2024-10-06T21:27:53] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Maybe I'll try 50a filed and 100a phase
[2024-10-06T21:28:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Maybe observer (on ortage because I heard mexlimming burning controllers)
[2024-10-06T21:28:32] NetworkDir: try 120A phase 500A batt and 20A fwk and 35KHz freq
[2024-10-06T21:28:42] NetworkDir: who say mxlemming burn controllers?
[2024-10-06T21:28:48] NetworkDir: you can use it works fine
[2024-10-06T21:29:12] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: That what I was told but maybe it's only the 75s (I'm on 84100s)
[2024-10-06T21:29:41] NetworkDir: I don't think i use mxlemming on 75100 without any problem
[2024-10-06T21:29:53] NetworkDir: just fake shunts cause wrong current read lol
[2024-10-06T21:29:54] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm mantis 10 rear zero 10x front different khz for each no ?
[2024-10-06T21:30:04] NetworkDir: use 35KHz for both
[2024-10-06T21:30:07] NetworkDir: or 30KHz
[2024-10-06T21:30:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Im on 30
[2024-10-06T21:30:22] NetworkDir: so keep it
[2024-10-06T21:31:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So try mexlimming and more phase amps less fwk ?
[2024-10-06T21:31:30] NetworkDir: yeah
[2024-10-06T21:31:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I have a record of speed (in my city) I don't want to lose it 😉😉
[2024-10-06T21:31:53] NetworkDir: xD what speed?
[2024-10-06T21:32:08] NetworkDir: with more phase amps you should have a better acceleration
[2024-10-06T21:32:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Better ?
[2024-10-06T21:32:22] NetworkDir: yes
[2024-10-06T21:32:28] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I already got sick acceleration
[2024-10-06T21:32:29] puneDir: @NetworkDir
[2024-10-06T21:32:41] NetworkDir: with more phase you would have a better

[2024-10-06T22:03:26] haku: have you burned any of the ly motors? im sure you did pushing them to its limits.
[2024-10-06T22:04:08] haku: testing right now bud.
[2024-10-06T22:05:22] haku: 85/150 at 36v 30a is best setup 😂
[2024-10-06T22:06:11] haku: no need for field weakening. its opposite of weak son
[2024-10-06T22:13:11] haku: whats your opinion on it?
[2024-10-06T22:15:45] haku: oh i see. would you reccomend domino throttle for seated setups or thumb?
[2024-10-06T22:16:21] haku: idk if you would consider mine high power.
[2024-10-06T22:17:28] haku: gotcha. whats a good reccomendation. ill prolly save this for the g30
[2024-10-06T22:18:13] haku: for sure. thanks bud

[2024-10-06T22:23:59] Patrick: Ah any other throttle you can recommend? Spin-y looks cool but i have no use then
[2024-10-06T22:24:55] Patrick: A throttle with low Dead zones, but not a g30 thumb throttle
[2024-10-06T22:26:59] Patrick: I like these type of throttles but dead zones are bad
[2024-10-06T22:27:10] Patrick: Is there any throttle like this but in good?
[2024-10-06T22:31:16] Patrick: Or how is the rion spin throttle? Same problems like the spin-y?
[2024-10-06T22:31:38] haku: this is it yea? im not sure wich brand but checked what it looks like and looks the same.
[2024-10-06T22:32:43] haku: looks like wuxing
[2024-10-06T22:33:02] haku: do they counterfiet these?
[2024-10-06T22:33:34] Face de Pin Sucé: I've burnt many things x)

[2024-10-06T22:46:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What about the wuxing 108 ?
[2024-10-06T22:59:06] haku: idk if super secret racing stuff but what is the phase limit of these 70h 33x2. what burns first the phase cables or windings?
[2024-10-06T22:59:56] haku: or vesc lol

[2024-10-06T23:15:46] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I tried the surron, it's a matter of taste. I've been riding motorcycles for 8 years but I've never gotten used to this type of accelerator on a scooter 🛴 On a motorcycle we sit down, the weight of our body piles up on the seat. On the scooter our body goes backwards. They are different ways of riding.

[2024-10-07T03:25:35] Noname: I was riding a 90cc atv today
[2024-10-07T03:25:48] Noname: Kid wanted the 4x4 I wanted to ride the 90 secretly
[2024-10-07T03:26:03] haku: front. with a bigger bag. if i make 20s4p folded it might fit the 5l bag

[2024-10-07T03:26:51] Noname: Honda trx90
[2024-10-07T03:27:24] Noname: My friend would never own one

[2024-10-07T03:29:29] haku: no one sells one
[2024-10-07T03:30:02] Noname: Well the neighbors came over because we scared the horse so prob not a bad idea. But there was 6 of us
[2024-10-07T03:30:18] Yamal: I can't forget 3shull 700 on the KTM, not because of the bike itself, but because of the controller, the power it has and the cold temperatures...
[2024-10-07T03:30:40] Yamal: Also 3shull1000 or seven 🔥
[2024-10-07T03:31:47] haku: atv are cool its just so loud. you cant really ride it without being noticed
[2024-10-07T03:46:58] Noname: Yeah but 100% power from full to empty so 🤷‍♂️
[2024-10-07T03:50:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: @punedir have u done research about electro customs spacial zero10x (kugoo g1) parts ?
[2024-10-07T03:50:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: https://youtube.com/@electrocustom4772?si=AQes83g334fePgVr
[2024-10-07T03:54:18] haku: very true. i wonder what tech evs use because even wiyh low charge its the same power output. capacitors maybe
[2024-10-07T03:54:49] Noname: Higher voltage than needed, tune it down in programing
[2024-10-07T03:55:05] haku: gotcha.
[2024-10-07T03:55:59] haku: this is what i want for the peak g30.
[2024-10-07T03:56:28] haku: just need to stretch dropout. good thing its steel
[2024-10-07T03:56:41] haku: i can get a welder to reinforce frame
[2024-10-07T03:57:14] haku: or a 10" qs lmao
[2024-10-07T03:57:14] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-07T03:58:06] Noname: That's a 12" rim so tire would be 16" +
[2024-10-07T03:59:49] haku: oh is it? i thought be 13" total
[2024-10-07T04:00:13] haku: maybe vsett or zero motor with 12" then
[2024-10-07T04:00:53] Noname: It shows height on the pic
[2024-10-07T04:01:11] haku: metric dam. i have to compute
[2024-10-07T04:01:42] Noname: 25.4 =1 freedom
[2024-10-07T04:02:55] haku: we will see options once we get there and get money haha
[2024-10-07T04:03:29] haku: no more spending on scooter/bike parts for myself. its too much unless on sale or used
[2024-10-07T04:04:11] haku: no resale value on these modified scooters/bikes unfortunately. people like it factory
[2024-10-07T04:05:03] haku: thats why vsett and ebike is prestine baby. no mods.
[2024-10-07T04:07:43] Noname: You mod a 9 when you have to much money
[2024-10-07T04:08:08] Noname: I'm running out of things to sell
[2024-10-07T04:08:14] haku: only james ive heard do that
[2024-10-07T04:08:39] Noname: Artem the spinny guy did
[2024-10-07T04:08:40] haku: 9 doesnt have alot of motor options
[2024-10-07T04:09:38] haku: oh thats right. he did get intouch with me when spinny broke last year. asked to fix it for free.
[2024-10-07T04:13:23] haku: resale value in vegas is not bad. people asking too much. but in LA they pretty much giving it away.
[2024-10-07T04:13:23] haku: <photos/photo_18236@07-10-2024_04-13-23.jpg>
[2024-10-07T04:13:55] haku: i can prolly sell laotie for $600 and be sold
[2024-10-07T04:56:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: https://youtu.be/Q5fY1LcjAJE?si=H4H3-HCxrUWMc_gm
[2024-10-07T05:19:31] Jason: this chat

[2024-10-07T05:59:14] Yamal: 11”!!! 170kmh 🎇
[2024-10-07T05:59:58] Yamal: <photos/photo_18237@07-10-2024_05-59-58.jpg>
[2024-10-07T06:01:44] Yamal: 10”!!!! XD
[2024-10-07T06:03:30] Noname: I want to make this electric idk why 😆
[2024-10-07T06:03:42] Yamal: ……..
[2024-10-07T06:03:51] Yamal: 👍
[2024-10-07T06:04:42] Yamal: To much work heh
[2024-10-07T07:05:23] haku: alright the best part. cutting copper 😭
[2024-10-07T07:05:24] haku: <photos/photo_18240@07-10-2024_07-05-24.jpg>
[2024-10-07T07:07:52] Noname: That's ridiculous
[2024-10-07T07:08:53] haku: thanks for helping with the configuration i will.never figure it out and @jamessoderstrom with the holders.
[2024-10-07T07:09:53] haku: folding it will be the difficult part i think. im not sure how .2 will fold. i hope it doesnt snap
[2024-10-07T07:11:48] Noname: fiber board in between gives it some room so it's not a flat bend
[2024-10-07T07:12:54] haku: yea. i might also use a 3d printed T shape to separate the main + -
[2024-10-07T07:13:20] haku: it will be too close together when folded. scary stuff
[2024-10-07T07:14:06] haku: or maybe make one out of epoxy board
[2024-10-07T07:14:12] Noname: <animation>
[2024-10-07T07:18:21] haku: i hope its just like how i cut the 40t but with an extra step
[2024-10-07T07:20:02] haku: everyone claiming the fastest. whos the real slim shady?
[2024-10-07T07:21:59] haku: when folded this layout will fit a surron you think?
[2024-10-07T07:22:17] Yamal: I'm just kidding, I mean 170kmh in 11" is cool
[2024-10-07T07:23:05] haku: but who is the fastest? french im sure.
[2024-10-07T07:23:25] haku: or is it weped korea?
[2024-10-07T07:23:59] haku: or america mini bike scoot?
[2024-10-07T07:24:09] haku: or turkey zero?
[2024-10-07T07:26:29] Yamal: 11”?
[2024-10-07T07:27:29] Yamal: Becaouse weped is fast but weped sonic is = 🐄
[2024-10-07T07:27:33] haku: anything that you will consider a scooter
[2024-10-07T07:28:07] haku: imo the word scooter is a spectrum.
[2024-10-07T07:28:07] Yamal: The one I mean weped sonic no is 11”
[2024-10-07T07:29:01] Yamal: Is 20 inch
[2024-10-07T07:29:13] haku: michelin tires
[2024-10-07T07:29:26] haku: i think
[2024-10-07T07:30:03] haku: is that weped a scooter or a emoto or a land jetski? what is it?
[2024-10-07T07:30:05] Yamal: and many things must be clarified, a scooter brand/factory is not the same as making it yourself at home......
[2024-10-07T07:30:18] Yamal: I think………..
[2024-10-07T07:30:36] Yamal: You can fit QS motor on g30 right ?
[2024-10-07T07:30:51] Yamal: I don’t know how but I know CAN!
[2024-10-07T07:30:56] haku: very different responses from people. there should be a official rule book for the scooter olympics
[2024-10-07T07:31:20] haku: yea if you really want too haha
[2024-10-07T07:32:16] Yamal: he The topic is complicated /// and hyperscooters too

[2024-10-07T07:33:01] Yamal: Is E-minimotobike custom
[2024-10-07T07:33:10] haku: they market it as scooter
[2024-10-07T07:33:27] Yamal: But your frame come from factory with one name right ?
[2024-10-07T07:33:59] haku: i think. but i believe its generic like laotie. im not sure
[2024-10-07T07:34:18] haku: only 1 company sells the version 2
[2024-10-07T07:37:04] haku: is this considered a bike or a dirtbike? what are the rules. https://youtube.com/shorts/7LNnMGAseTA?si=LzlvQ5SucIlp6KmJ

[2024-10-07T07:57:36] haku: no way that style suspension is superior to bike forks
[2024-10-07T07:57:52] Yamal: Be careful, wear a helmet and weight on the handlebars xD
[2024-10-07T08:05:04] haku: that folding minibike is sick though. so compact when folded
[2024-10-07T08:07:24] Yamal: Nice, but more nice the old type like rhyno right

[2024-10-07T08:27:04] Yamal: Don't you have roads in your area that at certain times there are no cars? In my case it is a stretch of highway near home (1.7km) It is the perfect straight line that every man wants to max out his machine, 100x100 illegal xD certain days at certain times there is no traffic
[2024-10-07T08:27:08] haku: like a futuristic look

[2024-10-07T08:35:30] Yamal: raphael fujiguara was part of the ragemechanic team but became independent
[2024-10-07T08:36:10] haku: yea. i know. now its a friendly rivalry

[2024-10-07T08:43:01] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-10-07T08:47:01] haku: i wonder how much weight he stripped off using carbon or whatever that material is
[2024-10-07T08:47:28] Yamal: Cool scooter and his black brother too
[2024-10-07T08:47:45] Happy Giraffe: One day I will mill a bike frame from alu😁

[2024-10-07T08:53:23] Yamal: If I had money, I would send a surron to happy giraffe so that he could ride a vesc and enjoy it.

[2024-10-07T18:36:29] 'lekrsu': Interesting idea
[2024-10-07T18:41:16] haku: what is that crack frame?
[2024-10-07T19:23:34] Jason: g30 lip
[2024-10-07T19:23:35] Jason: the sides
[2024-10-07T20:38:03] haku: this lever will work for ebrake yea? it just needs 2 cables?
[2024-10-07T21:08:38] 'lekrsu': Get one with a hall sensor instead of a switch
[2024-10-07T21:08:46] 'lekrsu': Often 0.5-2€ for a lever anyway
[2024-10-07T21:09:01] 'lekrsu': (Three wires)
[2024-10-07T21:09:34] haku: this is the only one available for kids size hands. let me check for more
[2024-10-07T21:11:36] 'lekrsu': You can wire a throttle as a brake as well, otherwise.
[2024-10-07T21:12:03] 'lekrsu': Just in parallel, however regen needs to be quite high for any braking power by itself.
[2024-10-07T21:12:06] haku: good idea. but i want him to get used to using the lever for brakes
[2024-10-07T21:12:27] 'lekrsu': Yeah good idea
[2024-10-07T21:12:53] 'lekrsu': Are the normal Ninebot levers hard to reach for kids? Never thought about that until now
[2024-10-07T21:13:27] haku: i havent checked. i dont have one unfortunately

[2024-10-07T21:31:26] haku: what motor is that?

[2024-10-08T02:28:39] haku: vsett 9+ can prolly do it with a light rider downhill lol

[2024-10-08T02:30:43] haku: love empanadas
[2024-10-08T02:31:26] haku: different spanish colonized countries do it differently but similar concept

[2024-10-08T02:42:22] Yamal: There is a lot of food tradition here and a strong mix of cultures,
[2024-10-08T02:43:17] Yamal: Never tried squid or octopus?
[2024-10-08T02:43:27] Yamal: The 2 almost the same

[2024-10-08T02:59:51] haku: v brakes is so shitty. its destroying the paint on the rim.
[2024-10-08T03:00:02] haku: i dont think this brakes is meant to stop at 20mph
[2024-10-08T03:06:40] Yamal: If I had brakes on my bicycles when I was little, the only thing I can think of is to look for a wheel with a disc and attach a support for the caliper.
[2024-10-08T03:07:35] Yamal: But that brake system is really bad...
[2024-10-08T03:08:55] Yamal: I definitely don't like it, it may have good geometry and good construction, but the double stem is not my thing,,
[2024-10-08T03:11:10] Yamal: and the truth is that once you upgrade a scooter, acquiring a new stock scooter out of the box doesn't make much sense, perhaps there is a model that can really impress etc,,, but nobody is going to spend €8/9000 on it. a scooter......
[2024-10-08T03:19:37] haku: some rich folks do this. buy new bike and strip it just for the frame.
[2024-10-08T03:20:11] haku: like those super 73s
[2024-10-08T03:20:22] haku: and fiidos
[2024-10-08T03:22:15] haku: like that numo ragemechanics build. that stuff aint cheap
[2024-10-08T03:25:00] Yamal: I've only had 2 scooters, Dualtron Thunder and Nami Viper, both second-hand, it's really cool to get a new one out of the box xD

[2024-10-08T03:33:51] haku: since we only keep just the frame anyway
[2024-10-08T03:34:31] Yamal: Good frames// good cells // good ESC
[2024-10-08T03:34:31] haku: too bad resale value on modded scooter/bike is so bad here
[2024-10-08T03:35:15] haku: not in my state but in others like california.
[2024-10-08T03:40:49] Yamal: Waiting for this Sunday to see what ragemechanic can do,, break the limits of the unknown to make it known and silence those mouths that only spout shit, and have no idea about anything, just about deceiving people and taking money from them, shit!!!!!
[2024-10-08T03:41:51] haku: i need to work on my battery. wheres that photo of BV i need inspiration
[2024-10-08T03:42:03] Yamal: Sometimes it makes us angry how they tease us, I don't like to speak badly or use bad words xD
[2024-10-08T03:42:16] Yamal: Hehe xD
[2024-10-08T03:43:04] haku: im sure the french has the fastest 11" but need proof. to silence that NY youtuber
[2024-10-08T03:44:10] haku: all they work on is science behind racing scooters. but that olympic opening left a stain in my heart permanently thats why i dont hype much

[2024-10-08T03:45:18] haku: see that remote he has. he controls all the vescs in the world. if he decides to go fuck it and press that button we all explode.
[2024-10-08T03:46:05] Yamal: I'm not talking about New York youtubers at all, they do a great job, and they show us each scooter model, I'm talking about some scooter Brand’s

[2024-10-08T06:36:11] haku: how does he even ride that. stepping on esc?
[2024-10-08T06:36:41] Yamal: If I have I send you,, but don’t have waiting for my new ESC,,,,, in one year just I ride like 4 months in dual xD ,is sad
[2024-10-08T06:36:59] Yamal: but the beginnings are always difficult
[2024-10-08T06:37:41] haku: sometimes we learn from mistakes. only gets better. now you know the limits of vesc
[2024-10-08T06:39:17] haku: its what they call street cred. more esc you blow up the bigger the reputation.
[2024-10-08T06:39:43] haku: thats a good thing i think
[2024-10-08T06:40:00] Noname: That's stupid

[2024-10-08T06:43:16] Yamal: True man xD
[2024-10-08T06:44:35] Yamal: Burning vesc is not good at all, and even less good for your pocket, it is a true tragedy, the less it is repeated the better!
[2024-10-08T06:44:44] Noname: It was 12's sold the 24
[2024-10-08T06:45:25] Yamal: No more Nucc, now only Vesc?

[2024-10-08T09:41:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What do you guys think about fitting an 11x motor on the 10x ? And how better is it ?

[2024-10-08T09:47:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm taking a risk of the motor getting cought in customs anyway
[2024-10-08T09:48:53] Yamal: i think your zero 10x is complete
[2024-10-08T09:54:47] Yamal: 100kmh on zero 10x

[2024-10-08T10:02:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Running 4.5kw through a 1200w motor would get u some heat
[2024-10-08T10:03:20] Yamal: Which are your C° controller ?
[2024-10-08T10:03:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But maybe it's because of high fwk low phase amps
[2024-10-08T10:03:58] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Vesc temp didn't go over 50 after a 1 hour aggressive ride
[2024-10-08T10:09:39] Yamal: So you just change the esc,,? The rest of the scooter is stock..?
[2024-10-08T10:10:52] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No haha

[2024-10-08T11:19:23] GABE: Spending spree then.
[2024-10-08T11:20:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes with one motor in the rear and this at the front https://www.falconpev.com.sg/products/zero-10x-front-wheel-hub

[2024-10-08T11:27:59] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Singapore I think no ?
[2024-10-08T11:29:08] Yamal: Yea.. also carbonrevo… but the scooter market or industry is literally dead here
[2024-10-08T11:29:19] Yamal: 2019 dead
[2024-10-08T11:29:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Zero10x comes like that in my country
[2024-10-08T11:29:52] Yamal: Yea sorry , you tell me before

[2024-10-08T11:30:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Before it was haven for electric
[2024-10-08T11:31:11] Yamal: There are very few licenses left... they started with weight and power limitations and ended with them limiting practically all the ways to circulate with the scooter, sad but true...
[2024-10-08T11:31:45] Yamal: True
[2024-10-08T11:31:52] Yamal: Lookatthis
[2024-10-08T11:32:27] Yamal: https://youtu.be/oJkbOkFJfxo?si=3FPr3IiEuHCXJwvP

[2024-10-08T11:32:38] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-08T11:35:28] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: There are limitations here also but it not comie country so hard to enforce (they started enforcing licence plates on pevs)
[2024-10-08T11:44:15] Yamal: also visit the carbonrevo store last year,, and to tell you that it was difficult for me to get in xD, they didn't let me take photos and the atmosphere was a bit uneasy,,,
[2024-10-08T11:44:55] Yamal: <photos/photo_18269@08-10-2024_11-44-55.jpg>
[2024-10-08T11:46:42] Yamal: I also tried to locate a member of tuneextreme and they sent me to a "minimotors" bicycle store and I couldn't meet anyone,,, so the scooter issue is buried here
[2024-10-08T11:48:30] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Did they said ai will control us one day. ?
[2024-10-08T11:48:49] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Sad bro really sad
[2024-10-08T11:49:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So they try to hide the scooters and the stores ?
[2024-10-08T11:52:37] Yamal: Just no there are scooter now only “some” but dificult to see ,, electric bicicle a lot
[2024-10-08T12:05:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: They have something specific against scooters ?

[2024-10-08T12:29:29] Paolo ⁭: You need 145mm fork opening, original is just 125mm
[2024-10-08T12:30:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ohh
[2024-10-08T12:30:49] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So which motor will fit ? (Bigger then 50h)
[2024-10-08T12:30:59] Paolo ⁭: No One as 11 inch
[2024-10-08T12:31:17] Paolo ⁭: You can get up to 65h with 125mm fork opening, but 10 inch

[2024-10-08T12:54:20] GABE: it'll be better in just a second
[2024-10-08T14:23:43] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Acabo de encontrar este increíble artículo en AliExpress. ¡Échale un vistazo! 20,58€ | Sensor de freno hidráulico para bicicleta eléctrica, palanca de freno de corte de energía, palanca de cambios, enchufe de conector impermeable de 2 pines https://a.aliexpress.com/_EuhL997
[2024-10-08T14:24:01] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I use those sensors

[2024-10-08T15:42:26] Yamal: Accident or what man
[2024-10-08T15:42:59] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Btw switched to mexlimming no difference (that I can feel/see maybe motor even hotter) @NetworkDir
[2024-10-08T15:43:34] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No just with the zero10x at high speeds high wind it's hard to stay on straight line
[2024-10-08T15:44:30] Yamal: but you put the weight on the handlebars vs stem...?
[2024-10-08T15:51:13] TrentXWB: Hi - I have Flipsky 75200 Pro V2 + Fake 1000W Motor in Ultra 4 Scooter with Daly BMS. All fine but I have good acceleration - then some rattling in motor kicks in and at higher speed all fine. I found sweet spot with 110 phase amps and ca 25 amps battery power. But this is boring - is it a motor problem (too much phase amps?)

[2024-10-08T16:08:34] NetworkDir: 110A phase for 25A batt seems high yes. Try 80A phase and change observer mxlemming without ortega
[2024-10-08T16:09:23] TrentXWB: What does it mean observer mxlemming and ortega?
[2024-10-08T16:19:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Are u ok ?

[2024-10-08T19:53:07] Yamal: I have to change the steering axle, the chassis doesn't worry me
[2024-10-08T19:53:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's not it's a mod
[2024-10-08T19:53:11] haku: how about the smaller nami. the one that looks like the dualtron

[2024-10-08T19:54:14] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: We have had a problem with the control cables. We are waiting for the Chinese to answer us to solve it and tomorrow we will start cooking.
[2024-10-08T19:54:17] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: We have a 30s BMS ANT, we only use 22s, so that's our doubt.
[2024-10-08T19:55:55] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No what I meant
[2024-10-08T19:58:06] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I can't find it rn but there is a blue nami with kaabo wolf front fork

[2024-10-08T20:12:14] Lisa: At max speed battery current = phase current
[2024-10-08T20:12:27] Lisa: Also flispky doesn’t have a good motor detection maybe that’s also why idk
[2024-10-08T20:26:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Show us motor detection results
[2024-10-08T20:27:44] TrentXWB: Can I see it in the VESC app (iPhone) somewhere?
[2024-10-08T20:28:09] TrentXWB: Amp value from detection was 58 amps or something
[2024-10-08T20:36:47] Lisa: When you finished motor detection a pop up shows up
[2024-10-08T20:36:56] Lisa: There you can see all the details
[2024-10-08T20:37:00] Lisa: Like motor resistance
[2024-10-08T20:43:11] puneDir: Dio vs zero

[2024-10-08T22:39:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So how come no one modified zero10x stems ?
[2024-10-08T22:39:39] haku: i do call this battery the twin towers. in memory of the victims of 9/11

[2024-10-08T22:57:23] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: In the end I put 0.1 the welder can weld 0.2 without problem 0.1 welds it then it is impossible to remove the copper sheet without breaking it
[2024-10-08T22:57:28] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: also solder the copper on the cell steel nickel on top

[2024-10-08T23:05:32] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: ☺️
[2024-10-08T23:05:40] haku: also using lines is very smart unless you really know spacing really well
[2024-10-08T23:07:14] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: That is, if we did not put lines it was impossible to hit the cell.
[2024-10-08T23:08:27] haku: im using a cheat guide lol.
[2024-10-08T23:09:26] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: We could not finish because of the problem with the control cables. We measured the cables and they are all fine, they all have their voltage but the BMS does not show well. We think we chose the wrong cables since the BMS is for 30s.
[2024-10-08T23:09:31] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: cheater 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2024-10-08T23:38:04] GABE: you can't be serious with the single welds.
[2024-10-08T23:39:20] GABE: no guarantee that'll hold at all
[2024-10-08T23:39:32] GABE: <photos/photo_18290@08-10-2024_23-39-32.jpg>
[2024-10-08T23:40:10] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: We did tests before starting to solder, to remove the copper once soldered you have to break it, it is impossible to remove it without breaking it
[2024-10-08T23:40:39] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: there was not finished only some attachment points
[2024-10-08T23:41:02] GABE: If you pick it up / move mass it can deweld everyw
[2024-10-08T23:42:35] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: We put 4 points in all cells
[2024-10-08T23:43:24] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: At the end of a series we put barley paper on it
[2024-10-08T23:56:15] haku: what scissors do you use to cut that .2 so nice and round?
[2024-10-08T23:56:39] haku: im struggling rounding the corners

[2024-10-09T01:08:37] Yamal: you will end up making batteries for your entire city,, By the way, making batteries for the Surron guys might be a good business xD
[2024-10-09T01:09:17] haku: for myself first. we need a test dummy
[2024-10-09T01:16:13] Yamal: But could you go out and test your motorcycle, right?
[2024-10-09T01:24:54] haku: yes. bag is arriving tomorow. it identifies as a minibike scooter
[2024-10-09T01:25:13] haku: everything wired up just waiting for bag
[2024-10-09T01:25:43] haku: then this p42 should be done this weekend
[2024-10-09T01:26:14] haku: hopefully the welder participates and doesnt break or blow holes

[2024-10-09T02:31:01] haku: everything is beautiful
[2024-10-09T02:31:52] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: this disc is much more famous

[2024-10-09T02:32:55] haku: in scooters
[2024-10-09T02:33:03] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Thx you, but I just wanted shared a motor speaker, but I feel like it doesn't make you fun like me 😂😂
[2024-10-09T02:33:32] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yeah it's like triphase speaker then 🤣
[2024-10-09T02:34:01] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 10mm2 câble for speaker 🔊
[2024-10-09T02:34:08] 'lekrsu': Third one's the ground to the chassi 😅
[2024-10-09T02:34:13] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it start to be a big power speaker
[2024-10-09T02:34:34] 'lekrsu': connect and *touch*
[2024-10-09T02:40:57] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: <video_file>

[2024-10-09T02:43:14] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: I made it

[2024-10-09T02:44:24] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: the top of Type C cable are consumable for me
[2024-10-09T02:49:03] Yamal: But why happen this ,, broken or something
[2024-10-09T02:50:42] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: what ?
[2024-10-09T02:53:03] Yamal: I mean, why does the engine make noise? when I shouldn't do it
[2024-10-09T02:54:31] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Are you talking about the resonance of brake disc?
[2024-10-09T02:55:03] haku: its bass dude.
[2024-10-09T02:55:22] Yamal: Just I see again the videos …
[2024-10-09T02:56:07] Yamal: Resonance I mean ……..
[2024-10-09T02:56:21] Yamal: Not disc
[2024-10-09T02:56:22] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: all shaking in the scooter, it's a scooter not a subwoofer 🤣
[2024-10-09T02:56:50] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Resonance it's I play Mp3 music on the motor with the vesc controller
[2024-10-09T02:57:08] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: haha 😂
[2024-10-09T02:57:36] Yamal: Is like no okay the motor..
[2024-10-09T02:57:57] haku: all vesc can do this now yea? version 6.05?
[2024-10-09T02:58:05] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's motor not speaker, it's normal it make horrible sound with resonance of everything xD
[2024-10-09T02:58:14] 'lekrsu': Have you ever heard resonance on a scooter frame when the frame isn't completely bolted down? Sounds like a rattlesnake at times, 😁
[2024-10-09T02:58:39] Yamal: I can't play the sound too loud, the children are sleeping xD
[2024-10-09T02:58:50] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yeah, but it's not user friendly, you need use Vesctool to convert and stream the mp3 to the motor by using lisp code
[2024-10-09T02:59:12] Yamal: It it’s like something is bad..
[2024-10-09T02:59:30] Yamal: Working bad ,, 😅
[2024-10-09T02:59:57] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yeah the sound is bad, it's normal, even juste the sound we have are insane it's motor controller and moto dude xD
[2024-10-09T03:00:23] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's motor dude, someone can explain to him? 😂😂
[2024-10-09T03:00:33] 'lekrsu': bad speaker 😁
[2024-10-09T03:00:49] 'lekrsu': must buy better 75h for cinema
[2024-10-09T03:00:57] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2024-10-09T03:01:30] haku: only controller that can do that. amazing
[2024-10-09T03:01:46] Yamal: Let's say it's something you generate with the Vesc application for fun...?
[2024-10-09T03:03:25] 'lekrsu': I think my speaker amp identifies as a motor: - Runs 36V - Makes uiui sounds - Shocks you badly if you touch the bullet plugs
[2024-10-09T03:08:10] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's not me, I just using a exemple script are integrated in 6.05
[2024-10-09T03:08:26] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but yeah, I test it for fun
[2024-10-09T03:08:31] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's totally useless
[2024-10-09T03:10:35] Yamal: you go Sunday for 170kmh too or not?
[2024-10-09T03:11:47] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: my scooter can't go to 170 kmh, it's optimized for torque not speed
[2024-10-09T03:12:13] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but maybe I will go, maybe not I don't know, but I will not go to run on case just see
[2024-10-09T03:12:14] Yamal: I thought your are using 33/2
[2024-10-09T03:12:26] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: no
[2024-10-09T03:12:26] Yamal: I mean 170/160/150 just for fun
[2024-10-09T03:12:38] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: I use something custom
[2024-10-09T03:12:47] Yamal: Nice
[2024-10-09T03:13:11] Yamal: brute force
[2024-10-09T03:13:23] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: race is finish for me, I don't care now

[2024-10-09T03:13:40] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: I convert my race scooter to city actually, that's why it's partially disassembly
[2024-10-09T03:13:44] Yamal: Yes I know you say before ,, sad….
[2024-10-09T03:13:54] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: I change for upper handle bar, suspension, more light
[2024-10-09T03:14:06] Yamal: Thunder or nami
[2024-10-09T03:14:41] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Thunder, Nami I am lazy to reassembly it
[2024-10-09T03:15:27] Yamal: Nami is ready for the city man! ;)
[2024-10-09T03:16:09] Yamal: Will you continue with the website and as a preparer I imagine,?
[2024-10-09T03:16:21] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: no because the nami are not waterproof, and the thunder yes
[2024-10-09T03:16:31] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: yes
[2024-10-09T03:16:59] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: but more as esthetic and integrated middle power stuff
[2024-10-09T03:17:59] Yamal: Are you getting married and are you expecting a child or what? xd
[2024-10-09T03:19:24] Yamal: It seems perfect to me, that everyone does what they want at all times and is happy doing what makes them happy... we are not here to waste time, time is gold they say...
[2024-10-09T03:20:24] Yamal: but you really surprised me with the thing about torque motors xD

[2024-10-09T04:08:54] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's not torque as you think like 22x3 motor
[2024-10-09T04:09:06] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: it's just torque like 150 kmh
[2024-10-09T04:09:50] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: haha, no just boring about Cup of scooter community
[2024-10-09T04:41:50] haku: you can always move to custom e motos. you have lots of knowledge from scooters

[2024-10-09T05:17:57] Noname: Why in a bag? Under the seat doesn't fit
[2024-10-09T05:19:58] haku: the 40t will not. it has to be external. the size was originally made for the laotie
[2024-10-09T05:20:22] haku: the p42 is the one that will fit the main compartment
[2024-10-09T05:20:33] haku: the one im working on
[2024-10-09T05:21:18] haku: p42 should be done soon. this bag is needs to be reinforced and crimped in parallel

[2024-10-09T05:52:06] Noname: Or wavy
[2024-10-09T05:52:53] Noname: Slide it over edge of table so slightly bends the other way
[2024-10-09T05:53:04] Yamal: But you make 2X 20s 12 p right?
[2024-10-09T05:53:11] haku: thats right last time i weld copper it was curled. no issues once you get some welds in
[2024-10-09T05:53:44] haku: no. 1 20s12p and external 20s 10p

[2024-10-09T05:59:17] haku: everyone is doing it. i need some points too
[2024-10-09T05:59:56] Yamal: The bag has a lot of straps, ideally it had a solid base, like some battery bags seen on the stems of some scooters...
[2024-10-09T06:00:20] haku: this one has a wierd stem. not a pole like a standing scooter
[2024-10-09T06:01:58] haku: peak g30 is still my favorite ride. that thing is fun

[2024-10-09T06:27:47] haku: im a pussy when it comes to that stuff.
[2024-10-09T06:33:33] Yamal: You don't have to try top speed on the first day, relax, it's not an obligation either, make your wheels burn on the streets of your city doing donut... but try not to let the patrol take you like the jumping black dwarf.
[2024-10-09T06:34:04] Yamal: Hehe
[2024-10-09T06:34:11] haku: i need to test if its even stable at 50kmh
[2024-10-09T06:34:50] Yamal: In any case, you have to enjoy the vehicles and everything takes time.
[2024-10-09T06:35:15] haku: the manufacturer said they can reach 70mph on thier esc and motors and battery.
[2024-10-09T06:35:28] Yamal: Let's see how those 700A phase feel xD
[2024-10-09T06:35:31] Noname: Just be careful with throttle in corner. Your front tire might go for a side quest
[2024-10-09T06:36:04] Noname: Quest sounds better 😆
[2024-10-09T06:36:12] haku: thats the laotie. same thing happened thats how i messed up leg. squarewave esc when turning
[2024-10-09T06:36:39] haku: front tire slipped and i ragdolled

[2024-10-09T14:07:38] Yamal: I want to find for the nami and they are very expensive,,
[2024-10-09T14:08:19] Yamal: lazy to go to a turner, but in the end it will be the best remedy
[2024-10-09T14:10:08] GABE: I've used lonnyo motors and they're great.
[2024-10-09T14:10:20] GABE: Dunno why anyone would buy from someplace else

[2024-10-09T14:49:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Vesc sticker whare ?
[2024-10-09T14:51:15] GABE: If I got 1% less (39%) on any 3 of these subjects I would've not passed and have to pay 6K or so and also repeat Year 1.
[2024-10-09T14:52:02] GABE: I saved about 9k, (3.5k lost too, income) by going monk mode and locking in 4 weeks before exams. Wouldve lost the two next year's income too and have to pay for the year after that as well. So 18k ISH.
[2024-10-09T14:53:46] GABE: just realized this is super serious shit, I'm going in today even though I have one class, and the commute is 2.5h.
[2024-10-09T14:54:10] GABE: Never been like this before. Taking it 100% serious from now on.
[2024-10-09T14:54:31] GABE: Mhm. More work.
[2024-10-09T14:54:31] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-10-09T15:20:48] Andrei Albert: Whos BV?
[2024-10-09T15:20:59] Yamal: I'm in charge of stealing a smile from him xD
[2024-10-09T15:21:05] Yamal: ?
[2024-10-09T15:21:31] Andrei Albert: What BV means
[2024-10-09T15:23:25] Yamal: BV is the reason we are here talking today, or that Rage Mechanic reaches the moon with his scooter, or that Raphael Fujiguara makes music with his esc, and so on endless things xD
[2024-10-09T15:23:31] Yamal: Benjamin Vedder
[2024-10-09T15:23:39] Yamal: King of kings
[2024-10-09T15:23:47] Andrei Albert: Aaaahhh:))
[2024-10-09T15:23:52] Andrei Albert: My apologies
[2024-10-09T15:24:31] Yamal: Don't worry, I learned it recently xD
[2024-10-09T15:25:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: https://youtube.com/@electrocustom4772?si=dyKLWLFD78VTEM3u He has upgrades for dualtron also
[2024-10-09T15:25:31] Andrei Albert: I gotta learn everything about vesc
[2024-10-09T15:25:43] Andrei Albert: But he still sells?
[2024-10-09T15:27:23] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I do not know
[2024-10-09T15:27:31] Yamal: For as and Dualtron , Sonken engineering is the NUMBER ONE
[2024-10-09T15:28:03] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes I think some of his parts fit zero10x also
[2024-10-09T15:28:26] Yamal: https://sonken-engineering.com/
[2024-10-09T15:37:59] Andrei Albert: I know that

[2024-10-09T15:39:46] Yamal: Is yours?
[2024-10-09T15:43:47] Yamal: I wouldn't mind purchasing another Thunder chassis in the future.
[2024-10-09T15:45:29] Yamal: The problem is always money, and it costs me a lot to acquire things!
[2024-10-09T15:56:00] Face de Pin Sucé: This system is a pain to install, should be strong, but very complicated and will have some play during lifetime
[2024-10-09T15:56:06] Face de Pin Sucé: I've installed one, never another
[2024-10-09T15:59:42] Yamal: What battery fits in a Thunder with the ESC inside?
[2024-10-09T16:00:00] Yamal: maybe I'll jump into the water xD
[2024-10-09T16:00:23] Yamal: ESC out side No nice….
[2024-10-09T16:00:34] Yamal: Like this

[2024-10-09T16:02:11] Andrei Albert: 20s 8p
[2024-10-09T16:02:21] Andrei Albert: Depends what esc
[2024-10-09T16:02:54] Andrei Albert: It’s better the first version?
[2024-10-09T16:03:12] Andrei Albert: I mean the reinforced thunder 1 version
[2024-10-09T16:03:12] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Andrei has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-10-09T16:08:41] Yamal: No to mach
[2024-10-09T16:09:08] Andrei Albert: Why
[2024-10-09T16:09:18] Yamal: 100kmh zero 10x !👍
[2024-10-09T16:09:49] Yamal: Everything inside like French style pretty cool for Everything
[2024-10-09T16:10:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yep (105)
[2024-10-09T16:10:33] Yamal: Show hehe
[2024-10-09T16:10:51] Yamal: But need custom frame,,,,,
[2024-10-09T16:11:05] Yamal: = 💵💥
[2024-10-09T16:11:28] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Mexlimming gave me 2 kmh more but slower acceleration (I think I don't know)
[2024-10-09T16:11:55] Yamal: With ESC outside,, 22s11p right?
[2024-10-09T16:12:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Almost 9kw
[2024-10-09T16:14:14] Andrei Albert: The biggest problem with custom frame it’s that if its longer it will be harder to carry
[2024-10-09T16:14:30] Andrei Albert: I have small elevators in this city
[2024-10-09T16:16:21] Andrei Albert: It depends if u use spacers or not
[2024-10-09T16:16:52] Andrei Albert: 22s 11p or 24s9p like mine
[2024-10-09T16:17:13] Face de Pin Sucé: We can make 22S8P with C350 inside, but only with our system, custom inside case for C350
[2024-10-09T16:17:31] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes a lot
[2024-10-09T16:18:06] Andrei Albert: I thought that too, the thunder 2 version i dont like it
[2024-10-09T16:18:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Propastunt or dubface kity has a lengthen frame
[2024-10-09T16:18:42] Yamal: 💥
[2024-10-09T16:18:49] Face de Pin Sucé: To avoid the risk to break, we use a clamp that takes both big nuts and the stem, this way it is safe
[2024-10-09T16:19:48] Andrei Albert: And the higher hinge? I saw that it brakes under the 2 screw for column
[2024-10-09T16:21:58] Face de Pin Sucé: Well we didn't face troubles so far
[2024-10-09T16:22:22] Andrei Albert: Only the wheelie guys:))
[2024-10-09T16:31:07] Yamal: Can’t fit 10p ..?
[2024-10-09T16:31:31] Andrei Albert: 24s?
[2024-10-09T16:31:34] Yamal: 20s
[2024-10-09T16:31:55] Andrei Albert: U can without spacers
[2024-10-09T16:47:29] TrentXWB: Hello - this lemmingmx Setup fixed the problem. I found sweetspot now with 35 amps (what battery can deliver) and 90 phase amps. Thanks for your help guys 👍
[2024-10-09T17:02:16] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What is that gives you in terms of performance?
[2024-10-09T17:03:18] GABE: oh my god
[2024-10-09T17:03:20] GABE: someone dropped this
[2024-10-09T17:03:29] GABE: I'm so lucky kek
[2024-10-09T17:03:45] GABE: gonna get so fucked off this
[2024-10-09T17:04:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Sensorless erpm ? (My front motor is sensorless) Does it supposed to stay default (700erpm) ???
[2024-10-09T17:04:10] TrentXWB: No more noise/rattle from motor. Don’t know - 44 km/h (without field weakening, don’t need more speed). Acceleration is ok for 1 motor
[2024-10-09T17:04:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <sticker>
[2024-10-09T17:04:36] TrentXWB: <photos/photo_18329@09-10-2024_17-04-36.jpg>

[2024-10-09T17:17:28] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 44?? How much ware you getting before?
[2024-10-09T17:18:42] haku: 40ah. 40t is 4ah i think
[2024-10-09T17:37:50] GABE: unsure if this is enough to mount the speedfork on rear.
[2024-10-09T17:50:15] Rose: Hey there Felix, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-10-09T17:53:14] Felix: Hello I can't properly connect my Vesc to the Ninebot G30 The problem is that it doesn't recognize the throttle and brake
[2024-10-09T18:48:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You need to tell way more in details ,also help chat is where you should do this
[2024-10-09T18:53:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I can take look later the week on this for you, i know this motor ,just it's not in my hands Also speed is about right,but note that mx lemming heats your motor more than ortega original Also is other setting on bemf ? Noise mostly is from a wrong setting, probably when it swiches into sensorless
[2024-10-09T18:54:12] haku: show me how you mounting it.
[2024-10-09T18:54:48] GABE: Sure ill put the motor on and secure it with vices
[2024-10-09T18:55:00] GABE: just wait, eating
[2024-10-09T18:55:48] TrentXWB: It’s only in a special speed range / it starts normal - this rattle (like limited slip) kicks in and kicks off at higher speed
[2024-10-09T18:55:49] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Wait so I'm running 12hp ? Well when u look at that from this perspective doesn't sound dangerous at all I don't know what that cop wanted.
[2024-10-09T18:56:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Describe problem more ,can you connecti via cable on the different sides? If yes maybe just id problem
[2024-10-09T18:56:05] GABE: its like a dirtbike
[2024-10-09T18:56:06] TrentXWB: What do you mean other settings on bemf?
[2024-10-09T18:56:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than this what i said
[2024-10-09T18:57:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I am not near a vesc to show setting where you find this ,i think motor sensorless But need to make sure
[2024-10-09T18:58:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Open same window where you find ortega or mx lemming Its the decupling🤔 but i dont remember menu names
[2024-10-09T18:59:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That also can make noises if set wrong
[2024-10-09T19:01:23] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <video_file>
[2024-10-09T19:03:44] haku: is it possible to have a gps plugged in to the 5v or 12v adc adapter? has anyone done that?
[2024-10-09T19:04:12] haku: something that will run on your batteries/vesc
[2024-10-09T19:11:55] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Drop down menu with other settings
[2024-10-09T19:12:00] Finn: Step down would work
[2024-10-09T19:12:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: (apologies for the audio it recorded Spotify also)
[2024-10-09T19:15:28] haku: how does stepdown work. splice from 72v battery to stepdown then to 12v?

[2024-10-09T19:18:10] GABE: @Bradhaku
[2024-10-09T19:18:28] GABE: Holding it with the other hand, only have one vice thingy
[2024-10-09T19:19:56] haku: you prolly want long bolts for that and a long insert in the middle
[2024-10-09T19:20:10] haku: like strong steel bolts
[2024-10-09T19:21:14] haku: thats how i would do it. you can also do your style
[2024-10-09T19:23:08] haku: or get a new frame that will fit that
[2024-10-09T19:25:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Sick motor I wish
[2024-10-09T19:26:33] haku: you might also want a spacer in between fork and frame to mount a disk brake
[2024-10-09T19:27:40] haku: or maybe not. there is space
[2024-10-09T19:28:10] Finn: Yes
[2024-10-09T19:28:33] haku: how much amps does it use?
[2024-10-09T19:29:38] Finn: They claim 1mA no load currenr
[2024-10-09T19:29:41] Finn: Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! 1,99€ | DC 9V 12V 24V 36V 48V 72V 84V 120V to 5V 3A / 2A Step Down Module Power Supply DC DC Converter Buck Converter Step Up Converte https://a.aliexpress.com/_EGqKHzL
[2024-10-09T19:30:06] haku: thanks bud
[2024-10-09T19:30:07] Finn: Measure before receiving. Mine were wrongly labeld and i put a 12v onto 6V lamp😒
[2024-10-09T19:47:40] GABE: there is space.
[2024-10-09T19:52:08] haku: post that in g30 chat see what they can do to help
[2024-10-09T19:52:26] haku: i have no idea about engineering
[2024-10-09T19:53:36] haku: heres a my basic understanding of what your trying to do.
[2024-10-09T19:59:53] puneDir: <photos/photo_18338@09-10-2024_19-59-53.jpg>

[2024-10-09T20:06:51] haku: you still doing 12p on this build?
[2024-10-09T20:08:08] haku: i think you will scrape the floor or not be able to get some traction with how low its gonna be. 12p folded is thick dude. plus bms and vesc

[2024-10-09T21:52:41] GABE: 5-7cm clearance with 175mm spring and possibly more with a 200mm but unsure if the geometry will be good yet
[2024-10-09T21:53:44] GABE: Done the calculations on paper but just a visual representation here
[2024-10-09T21:55:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: As the guys said above From finger throttle type vsett/ minicrap could work but worst thing you can have if you dont wire out throttle , the one you linked is a flipsky after they made there own System,look still similar
[2024-10-09T21:56:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He could sell you even ,since he resell a brand of vesc in the Eu
[2024-10-09T21:58:59] GABE: Oh God, this is the normal clearance apparently, Yeah. I think good in comparison.
[2024-10-09T21:59:12] haku: yea theres space
[2024-10-09T21:59:13] GABE: that's 2-3x less than what I think I'll have.
[2024-10-09T21:59:15] GABE: Omg
[2024-10-09T21:59:43] haku: let me measure double decker battery later

[2024-10-09T22:00:31] GABE: In there yes.
[2024-10-09T22:00:45] GABE: <photos/photo_18344@09-10-2024_22-00-45.jpg>

[2024-10-09T22:02:01] haku: consider the thick wires too. 6awg
[2024-10-09T22:02:22] GABE: multiple 8awg can be fine
[2024-10-09T22:02:24] GABE: too
[2024-10-09T22:02:36] GABE: Need double qs8 which I have
[2024-10-09T22:02:41] GABE: possibly can do one qs8
[2024-10-09T22:03:10] GABE: Still enough space for Vesc and throttle shit
[2024-10-09T22:03:10] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-10-09T22:03:46] haku: dang this will be the craziest g30 so far if done.
[2024-10-09T22:04:31] haku: very hard to do with just bolt on stuff. need some type of welder
[2024-10-09T22:06:07] puneDir: My fav is jk

[2024-10-09T22:06:44] haku: limo g30
[2024-10-09T22:06:55] GABE: This wouldn't be possible at all if @fungus93 didn't show his escs in a welded box in the newfound space at the Back.
[2024-10-09T22:07:03] GABE: Id have to drop to 9/10p.
[2024-10-09T22:07:09] GABE: Now I don't need to
[2024-10-09T22:07:19] GABE: It's his idea, I just saw it in chat and was like omg. On his 20s10p G30 18650 with 10" tyres
[2024-10-09T22:08:34] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Not running vesc software
[2024-10-09T22:09:05] GABE: 20s10p LG MH1 on g30 :D

[2024-10-09T22:11:27] GABE: isn't the range insane
[2024-10-09T22:11:42] Cengiz Han GENÇALİ: My monorim gave me cancer
[2024-10-09T22:11:52] GABE: the rear?
[2024-10-09T22:12:25] Cengiz Han GENÇALİ: I fixed the rear, but this time there was a problem in the front.
[2024-10-09T22:14:15] Dede Dede: Understand
[2024-10-09T22:14:33] GABE: How is your spacer assembled like Legos, can you send the STL please?
[2024-10-09T22:14:45] GABE: can I recreate that with a different height? Does the STL consist of two separate pieces?
[2024-10-09T22:15:11] GABE: <photos/photo_18347@09-10-2024_22-15-11.jpg>
