[2024-12-19T23:46:45] GABE: It's so fucking bad dude like literally RC car accel
[2024-12-19T23:47:12] GABE: worked somewhat fine with pedals on my ebike
[2024-12-19T23:47:42] GABE: Sensorless and pushing the pedals at the same time synchronizes the phases very much and helps with real starts
[2024-12-19T23:47:44] GABE: Try it. Still cuts if you don't match the rpm of pedals to motor tho and the sound is awful U feel it like a car clutch WAIT THAT THING HAS NO PEDALS LOL Try push it with your legs before you use phase accel
[2024-12-19T23:52:05] GABE: HATE THAT
[2024-12-19T23:54:20] haku: nope. it doesent detect halls for some reason
[2024-12-19T23:54:59] haku: but once it gets going its smooth ride
[2024-12-20T00:00:07] GABE: Dead halls no
[2024-12-20T00:00:21] GABE: motor might be rotting inside
[2024-12-20T00:00:26] GABE: I'd take a look
[2024-12-20T00:00:52] GABE: Halls the only things that can actually cause a water damaged motor to "stop working"
[2024-12-20T00:01:39] haku: i opened. its prestine
[2024-12-20T00:01:54] GABE: Have you checked for continuity on each hall line?
[2024-12-20T00:02:17] haku: no because i ran it on stock esc and runs smoothly
[2024-12-20T00:02:27] GABE: Wtf
[2024-12-20T00:02:42] haku: vesc doesnt detect
[2024-12-20T00:02:44] GABE: Did you wire it randomised
[2024-12-20T00:03:11] haku: ofcourse not. i followed the rainbow
[2024-12-20T00:04:21] GABE: Wtf
[2024-12-20T00:04:23] GABE: and still no work
[2024-12-20T00:04:38] GABE: benign
[2024-12-20T00:04:40] haku: even if the green blue and yellow is not matching it should detect
[2024-12-20T00:05:29] GABE: did you prime the motor with motor wizard after plugging in the new hall wiring
[2024-12-20T00:05:50] GABE: Cause it won't work the other way around
[2024-12-20T00:07:22] haku: whats motor wizard i just use setup motor. what prime?
[2024-12-20T00:07:33] GABE: Yeah that's it
[2024-12-20T00:07:47] GABE: I assumed perhaps you plugged in the new halls without running motor detection
[2024-12-20T00:08:09] GABE: There's no other explanation
[2024-12-20T00:08:13] haku: right. thats woke af. ide never do that
[2024-12-20T00:08:36] GABE: Esc could be violated but hopefully not
[2024-12-20T00:08:42] GABE: It works with other motors ya?
[2024-12-20T00:09:00] GABE: if not then yikes
[2024-12-20T00:09:25] haku: yes. it works.
[2024-12-20T00:10:38] GABE: Last thing you could've wrong is soldered in such a way that creates impedance which fucks up the hall signals
[2024-12-20T00:10:47] GABE: There's nothing else
[2024-12-20T00:11:25] haku: thank you for the advice. finish g30 or you dont get any recognition
[2024-12-20T00:11:54] GABE: Like the copper wires being stuck in lead sure but the issue is the amount of length the electrons gotta flow to meet w the other copper
[2024-12-20T00:12:29] GABE: damn you can't check resistance either
[2024-12-20T00:12:39] GABE: Not unless you open that shit again
[2024-12-20T00:12:47] GABE: don't need any I just wanna help
[2024-12-20T00:12:58] haku: ty.
[2024-12-20T00:25:19] haku: @jamaludin_algarnati does your scooter have a massage chair? quality of life baby.
[2024-12-20T00:28:30] haku: another photo shoot christmas theme this time.
[2024-12-20T00:39:21] Noname: Want a fly by vid not sybian
[2024-12-20T00:41:05] haku: thats the best i can do
[2024-12-20T00:41:27] Noname: I'd doesn't drive?
[2024-12-20T00:42:00] haku: no halls. sensorless
[2024-12-20T00:42:13] haku: need to push
[2024-12-20T00:42:39] haku: cant even cary my weight at low speeds. so lame
[2024-12-20T00:45:31] haku: why doesnt it detect sensors? woke motor? broken halls?
[2024-12-20T00:52:14] haku: i get it now. its like a clutch. you cant just take your foot off. its to be gradual. like the throttle i push too much current it vibrates
[2024-12-20T00:52:14] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-20T01:12:54] haku: gotcha. ill try that. thanks
[2024-12-20T01:14:17] haku: @jamaludin_algarnati can you workout with your scooter? quality of life baby.
[2024-12-20T01:18:30] haku: where is this setting
[2024-12-20T01:25:15] haku: thanks
[2024-12-20T01:26:53] Noname: Quit dicking around. Where's the fly by
[2024-12-20T01:37:10] haku: after i fix halls. this shit slow.
[2024-12-20T01:38:06] Noname: Don't need halls after starting from 0. Only needed for direction
[2024-12-20T01:38:53] haku: dude it vibrates when you floor it even when moving at slow speeds
[2024-12-20T01:39:19] Noname: Something else wrong then.
[2024-12-20T01:39:25] haku: maybe yea
[2024-12-20T01:39:30] Noname: You missing a phase?
[2024-12-20T01:39:42] haku: let me check
[2024-12-20T01:44:45] haku: something really off. only when the motor has weight it cant push it.
[2024-12-20T02:12:44] haku: very weak
[2024-12-20T02:13:05] haku: gotcha
[2024-12-20T02:14:35] haku: ill try that. thanks
[2024-12-20T02:17:22] haku: ill ride it tommorow. and report. i will check for halls too if bad
[2024-12-20T02:35:33] Jason: set up vss
[2024-12-20T02:54:55] haku: tried it on 50a. same thing.
[2024-12-20T02:55:01] haku: whats that
[2024-12-20T02:55:23] Jason: sensorless zero start possible
[2024-12-20T02:55:29] haku: i cant help but ride it even though its stutters
[2024-12-20T02:55:39] haku: gotcha erpm loop to 0 yea
[2024-12-20T02:57:41] Jason: mmm
[2024-12-20T03:05:22] haku: thats that sexy jrev fender?
[2024-12-20T03:06:23] Jason: yea
[2024-12-20T03:06:32] Jason: sexy jrev fender but in PLA
[2024-12-20T03:06:36] Jason: 12 walls
[2024-12-20T03:06:45] Jason: at the bottom where it breaks
[2024-12-20T04:00:30] haku: very wierd i just check voltages on halls its perfectly fine. why does vesc not detect it
[2024-12-20T04:02:54] haku: nothing
[2024-12-20T04:04:09] haku: <photos/photo_20191@20-12-2024_04-04-09.jpg>
[2024-12-20T04:05:55] haku: its having a hard time even in very small incline
[2024-12-20T04:06:45] haku: even when wheel is rolling already
[2024-12-20T04:06:59] haku: yes
[2024-12-20T04:07:50] haku: where is that setting bro
[2024-12-20T04:08:04] haku: gotcha. thanks
[2024-12-20T04:11:27] haku: bothe these yea.
[2024-12-20T04:12:08] haku: this is some technical vesclord stuff.
[2024-12-20T04:14:47] haku: so 493 the inductance
[2024-12-20T04:15:45] Noname: Holy shit he did math
[2024-12-20T04:16:06] haku: 175 IR
[2024-12-20T04:16:36] haku: im so proud of myself tbh
[2024-12-20T04:18:25] haku: ill charge battery and test at full bat tommorow
[2024-12-20T04:27:17] haku: at 70 phase we pulled 3k baby.
[2024-12-20T04:29:43] Noname: Idk if I'd trust those numbers.
[2024-12-20T04:30:39] haku: need gps
[2024-12-20T04:31:37] Noname: Starting to feel the wind in your face is 12mph lol
[2024-12-20T04:31:48] haku: lmao
[2024-12-20T04:31:54] Noname: Serious
[2024-12-20T04:33:01] haku: i measured with gps. i have tire size all fucked up. im not to sure what mm diameter
[2024-12-20T04:34:05] haku: i set it a 320mm like the wepoor
[2024-12-20T04:53:22] Noname: Imput the height of tire aka diameter
[2024-12-20T05:17:08] haku: ok. ill check tommorow
[2024-12-20T05:22:00] haku: 30a
[2024-12-20T05:22:35] haku: 20s
[2024-12-20T05:23:04] haku: agreed. its getting warm on short rides already
[2024-12-20T05:24:03] haku: what should i set it at. on this kind of jetson motor? ir is too high. i dont even know what winding
[2024-12-20T05:24:22] haku: gotcha. thanks
[2024-12-20T05:26:53] haku: thanks bro. but no worries. its the holidays. this can wait. ill mess around with it.
[2024-12-20T05:36:59] Yamal: Jetson!!!!
[2024-12-20T05:41:06] haku: very sketchy at 30+mph. cant even ride one handed because of the long stem
[2024-12-20T05:42:02] haku: and handlebar so short. but its okay. good for short rides if i fix stutter on motor
[2024-12-20T05:42:23] Yamal: Better Peak g30?
[2024-12-20T05:42:37] haku: peak g30 i trust with my life
[2024-12-20T05:43:27] haku: if i had cruise control on that i could drive it with my elbows while texting. close enough to tesla auto steer
[2024-12-20T05:44:36] haku: peak g30v2 time will come. and that one im really excited for
[2024-12-20T05:45:42] Yamal: I am looking forward to starting a new project.
[2024-12-20T05:48:47] Yamal: I think I'll start training in January, there are very short holidays coming up, etc., but I'm also looking forward to starting the dance in the circuit
[2024-12-20T05:48:56] haku: project 2025 baby. lets see the dualtron
[2024-12-20T05:50:19] Yamal: and the routes continue! Probably tomorrow I will take a route to some natural hot water springs
[2024-12-20T05:50:53] haku: im only confined to the hood. lucky you have good routes
[2024-12-20T05:52:38] Yamal: You need your scooter bike
[2024-12-20T05:53:57] haku: even with the wepoor theres no where to go but desert. lots of dirt trails here though. need a e dirtbike
[2024-12-20T05:54:41] Yamal: Connect towns
[2024-12-20T05:55:12] haku: yea. i did that on wepoor. good stuff.
[2024-12-20T05:56:30] Yamal: 12p 🤯
[2024-12-20T05:56:39] Yamal: Moli🤯
[2024-12-20T05:57:13] haku: old tech. better ones for less now
[2024-12-20T05:57:48] haku: but cycle life is good on these p42s i think
[2024-12-20T05:57:57] haku: it will last a while

[2024-12-20T06:22:17] Yamal: Ragemechanic Winner Why James thunder storm,,?
[2024-12-20T06:22:17] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-20T07:03:46] haku: thata the kugoo pitbike i think. its a generic frame pitbike. goes by different names
[2024-12-20T07:04:38] haku: 112mph gps confirm and draggy like rage.
[2024-12-20T07:08:28] haku: how much do these cost?
[2024-12-20T07:14:50] Yamal: 180? Nahh
[2024-12-20T07:16:08] Yamal: I thought they declared 160 or so it is true that one of the models has quite a voltage but we actually need GPS tests
[2024-12-20T07:16:22] Yamal: I see
[2024-12-20T07:16:26] haku: thats what they claim in title
[2024-12-20T07:16:28] Yamal: But expensive
[2024-12-20T07:17:27] haku: right now i think rage mechanics has showed whos top dog. proven video, draggy, gps and telemetry
[2024-12-20T07:17:41] Yamal: https://fastride.fr/fr/309-velity
[2024-12-20T07:17:48] Yamal: Eu..
[2024-12-20T07:17:55] haku: also those velity comes with fardrivers yea
[2024-12-20T07:18:04] Yamal: …
[2024-12-20T07:18:12] Yamal: Only B
[2024-12-20T07:19:22] haku: well fardrivers bang for buck but if your spending alot on a premium "hyper scooter" it should come with the best vescs
[2024-12-20T07:19:53] haku: also tubeless split rim
[2024-12-20T07:20:46] Yamal: BV is the man of the moment, let's see if we find him one day
[2024-12-20T07:23:00] Yamal: Soon I will start opening accounts on everything related to vesc project until I find it!
[2024-12-20T07:23:51] haku: hes somewhere out there. i dont even know if he communicates
[2024-12-20T07:24:20] haku: maybe you can find him on eskate boards
[2024-12-20T07:24:37] haku: i think thats his thing.
[2024-12-20T07:24:59] Yamal: He really is someone great and brilliant and best of all he goes completely unnoticed, I take this one to the red Hollywood catwalk
[2024-12-20T07:25:16] haku: like vesc was originally made for eskate i think
[2024-12-20T07:26:08] haku: but the vesc platform is amazing. just up to the community to build the biggest baddest vesc
[2024-12-20T07:27:06] haku: too bad str500 was cancelled or flopped. not sure why its not sold anymore
[2024-12-20T07:27:13] Yamal: I don't know why Trampa doesn't talk more about King B
[2024-12-20T07:27:16] Yamal: True
[2024-12-20T07:27:27] Yamal: Never see again on the website
[2024-12-20T07:28:05] haku: thats not bvs work though. other guy made it.
[2024-12-20T07:28:52] Yamal: needs a good team of engineers who together with Benjaming magic could break the market, no more Trampa, just Vikings
[2024-12-20T07:29:46] haku: if i personally knew BV i would market his stuff. when i build my YT channel
[2024-12-20T07:30:16] Yamal: Trampa I think now have sad”” times
[2024-12-20T07:30:27] haku: vesc really needs to take off in the US
[2024-12-20T07:30:51] haku: sad fardriver is the generic option here
[2024-12-20T07:30:57] Yamal: Your work..
[2024-12-20T07:31:32] Yamal: Foc forever no it’s there now,, so yes YOU CAN
[2024-12-20T07:32:11] Yamal: Wepoor your best friend for show American people what it’s the POWAR
[2024-12-20T07:32:14] haku: but you know its good to know all controllers. just to see which has the best and most powerful tech
[2024-12-20T07:32:39] Yamal: Types VESC ?
[2024-12-20T07:33:20] haku: no all brands of controllers and how they work and see for yourself wich is best. right now im very vesc biased
[2024-12-20T07:33:28] Yamal: Start your YouTube channel
[2024-12-20T07:33:48] Yamal: VESC project paradise suport that chaneel
[2024-12-20T07:33:53] haku: 2025 i will. just need funds for go pro and insta 360
[2024-12-20T07:34:02] Yamal: Also have the new friend fresh charger
[2024-12-20T07:34:07] Yamal: Lestg0
[2024-12-20T07:34:44] haku: we will do podcasts about vescs/ scooters/ seated vs non seated debates.
[2024-12-20T07:35:58] Yamal: also some live shows, with the occasional Viking woman with a helmet and horns holding the microphone
[2024-12-20T07:36:00] haku: i can see it now. we will make vesc great again
[2024-12-20T07:36:28] haku: yes. YT channel has to be wild
[2024-12-20T07:37:58] Yamal: VESC scooter group live
[2024-12-20T07:38:53] haku: alright bedtime. goodnight bud.
[2024-12-20T07:39:05] Yamal: make it clear that I do not want to be the protagonist, here the protagonist is called BENJAMIN VEDDER
[2024-12-20T07:39:26] Yamal: Have a good rest big Haku 💪
[2024-12-20T07:48:05] Yamal: Y0
[2024-12-20T07:48:40] Yamal: The wife of a co-worker made it, and he has brought it now
[2024-12-20T08:25:47] Yamal: @Foujiwara we miss you
[2024-12-20T08:25:48] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-20T10:51:45] Lieven L.: What kind of light is that? looks really good
[2024-12-20T11:21:36] Yamal: Amazon ,, good light but little autonomy since it has two low capacity cells, I had to buy it a little urgently but the ideal is to look for it more carefully through Aliespress and with 10,000 mah capacity
[2024-12-20T12:00:59] Lieven L.: Got a link to it?
[2024-12-20T12:31:04] Yamal: I send before this group when it arrive
[2024-12-20T12:31:09] Yamal: I think
[2024-12-20T12:31:13] Yamal: Busy now ,,
[2024-12-20T13:29:07] Yamal: https://amzn.eu/d/4qx3Soz
[2024-12-20T13:29:32] Yamal: But better get in Aliespress 10.000 mah
[2024-12-20T13:29:32] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-20T13:40:25] Lieven L.: Well i have a similar looking one with 3 leds. But the lighting is somewhat shitty, because it creates a single bright spot and thats it.
[2024-12-20T13:41:48] Yamal: Me 6 leds

[2024-12-20T23:57:53] Yamal: Going to university is fine, but with the goal of starting your own company, not with the goal of being a qualified worker in my opinion.
[2024-12-20T23:58:41] haku: im just fucking with gabe. he should finish the g30
[2024-12-20T23:58:50] Yamal: It's sad, some with university degrees working at burgerking
[2024-12-21T00:00:47] haku: anyways jetson only stutters when motor hot. i let it cool down and got home
[2024-12-21T00:01:04] Yamal: Many leave this country because the job opportunities there are are sad, but living in a country where it rains almost every day and is cloudy so well is sad man.
[2024-12-21T00:01:27] Rose: Hey there Giuseppe, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-12-21T00:03:24] Yamal: Tonight a friend is traveling with a van loaded with olive oil to Germany. XD

[2024-12-21T00:57:30] GABE: Going to do 18s for more kWh cause that m365 cell would be so ass when working alone
[2024-12-21T00:58:08] GABE: 80% more Kwh
[2024-12-21T00:58:09] haku: why not 20s and have 1 charger

[2024-12-21T00:58:32] GABE: and an extra 2s Internal
[2024-12-21T00:59:01] GABE: Because the 2 cells 10S and 8S are separate cells you see
[2024-12-21T00:59:11] GABE: It's the only combination I found that would work with no welder
[2024-12-21T01:11:28] Rose: Hey there Giuseppe, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2024-12-21T01:52:35] haku: maybe yours different
[2024-12-21T01:52:50] GABE: the entire blade for this motor is the actual heatsink
[2024-12-21T01:52:51] haku: no just plug to vesc do motor detection
[2024-12-21T01:52:53] GABE: the dissipation is great
[2024-12-21T01:52:54] GABE: ah

[2024-12-21T09:42:02] Jason: yes
[2024-12-21T09:42:02] Jason: temp sensor in motor
[2024-12-21T09:42:05] Jason: and esc

[2024-12-21T09:42:36] Yamal: Temp motor sensor = Pro rider
[2024-12-21T09:44:56] Yamal: Going now natural hot water hot springs, they are in the middle of the countryside, I don't know what I'm going to find, I haven't been there for quite a few years, they're not too far from home...
[2024-12-21T09:48:02] Yamal: The prettiest ones are 55km away, so I have chosen to go to the closest ones, so as not to have to stop to charge the e-scooter.
[2024-12-21T10:29:18] Yamal: XD

[2024-12-21T11:25:46] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yesterday I arrived home but today when I left in the morning I saw that the scooter does not accelerate. I entered the Vesc app when my surprise is that the cam does not work.

[2024-12-21T11:50:55] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I'm going to look at the SMD values ​​to see if it's not broken but I don't understand. Yesterday I got home fine, everything was perfect. This morning when I left, it no longer works 😡
[2024-12-21T11:52:32] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Since it is better not to ask Racemecanic for anything, I will have to find a way to do it. I have been waiting for an answer to these messages, so why would I ask him anything again?

[2024-12-21T12:35:08] @£¥€π.: I try but it starts on it's oun and only engaged the break if it goes slow
[2024-12-21T12:35:44] @£¥€π.: And the pedal asist not working with ADC1 or RX or TX
[2024-12-21T12:36:38] @£¥€π.: ADC 2 I use for variable regen breaking only
[2024-12-21T12:39:25] Paolo ⁭: @SibClimb help needed
[2024-12-21T12:45:26] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Thank you very much Paolo, but I don't want your help. I just put it there so you can see that he is very, very informal. Since I bought the controllers from him, I had to ask for help from other places for programming. Nothing happens. It was just so you can see that there is no technical support on his part.
[2024-12-21T12:51:35] Yamal: 111 km you do on g30 today,,?
[2024-12-21T12:56:35] GABE: <photos/photo_20238@21-12-2024_12-56-35.jpg>
[2024-12-21T12:56:42] GABE: Ebike cell
[2024-12-21T12:57:38] GABE: 20s3p
[2024-12-21T12:57:46] GABE: Gonna foam it up.
[2024-12-21T13:01:54] Jason: yeah
[2024-12-21T13:02:12] Jason: did suffer from lack of capacity
[2024-12-21T13:02:15] Jason: had fun definitely
[2024-12-21T13:02:24] Jason: zooming around with 65h and torturing tf out of batt
[2024-12-21T13:02:48] Jason: I did like 3~4 charges
[2024-12-21T13:02:49] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jason has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-21T13:03:26] Yamal: Amazing
[2024-12-21T13:04:51] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: About two months ago I also tried it here but it happened to me the same way that I did it privately, meaning I don't know anything about it but this way I know where not to buy any product again.
[2024-12-21T13:06:55] Jason: also made a mistake of
[2024-12-21T13:06:59] Jason: not bringing adapters
[2024-12-21T13:07:16] Jason: brought spare batt, didn't bring adapter
[2024-12-21T13:44:33] ✨🇪🇸عمر: <video_file>
[2024-12-21T13:44:54] ✨🇪🇸عمر: the neighbors came to complain about the noise 🥲🥲🥲
[2024-12-21T14:00:37] Face de Pin Sucé: Don't get me wrong, I helped you in the past, look at the conversation, but people need to understand one thing : Buying a controller doesn't mean the seller will take free time to set up My customers paies me to install and make a configuration on their scooters, so those are guaranteed. When you buy a flipsky or anything else, you don't ask Flipsky to make your setup. Regarding the canbus broken, from my memories, you put B+ in wrong place in the controller. Repairing it doesn't mean it will work indefinitely, because all the components on the line that shouldn't be supplied with this voltage can be damaged. And changing a component by resoldering it, can work for a time, and break again. I apologize for not responding on your asking of help, but you need to understand, I have very much messages, and sometimes, I see them, then forget or no time to answer, and I don't put those asks in my to-do list.
[2024-12-21T14:02:01] Face de Pin Sucé: And this connector doesn't break by itself, it is a Molex Microclasp, very good quality connectors, and never broke one, so might be something wrong, like the cable is in tension or during disassembly
[2024-12-21T14:03:58] 'lekrsu': As for the configuration, hit the backup button and reset afterwards.
[2024-12-21T14:04:26] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I prefer not to answer a greeting
[2024-12-21T14:15:10] Face de Pin Sucé: No problem, but keep in mind : There is a Facebook group dedicated to 3Shul Help And Support This telegram group is called Vesc Help, meaning if you need help, you can ask in the dedicated channel. For the record, RFP Performance charges 30€/30min to his customers if they need help configuring their controllers Anyway, if any troubles regarding warranty, I will always answer
[2024-12-21T14:24:26] Paolo ⁭: By this statement (if fully true), unfortunately Sib is right. Since vesc is very easy to break if not Installed carefully, it can die in every moment. You can ask for support if he installed the controller , and the store got paid for the work.
[2024-12-21T14:25:32] Paolo ⁭: Since he is store, he charges customer for the time. We help for free because is community here, but unfortunately I don't have knowledge on 3shul
[2024-12-21T14:27:10] NetworkDir: High voltage/current controllers mostly need good knowledge because their very sensitive Normal scooter clients never can't setup without any problem unfortunately
[2024-12-21T14:27:26] NetworkDir: 3shul also need some tricks for works well

[2024-12-21T14:28:15] Face de Pin Sucé: I know I have my flaws, I'm not fast to answer messages, but I never lie
[2024-12-21T14:30:34] Paolo ⁭: Yes but even if u want to complain, you need someone that can manage after sale service. If you want good brand reputation.
[2024-12-21T14:31:29] Face de Pin Sucé: That is true
[2024-12-21T14:31:55] Face de Pin Sucé: Problem is, someone able to answer to those technical messages is not easy to find these days
[2024-12-21T14:34:17] Paolo ⁭: With good salary, everything is possible bro
[2024-12-21T14:39:29] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: The right one is broke itself by magic, and the multiple damage on the left one like screwdriver marking on top are also make itself ? 😂 Haha I don't understand how you can imagine that anyone will believe you
[2024-12-21T14:40:08] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: After the pros have a bad reputation but what to do with such dishonest customers...
[2024-12-21T14:40:11] Andrei Albert: Like in many technical jobs, the knowledge is the problem not the salary
[2024-12-21T14:41:09] 'lekrsu': All of us sit on knowledge that we don't have the effort to share without compensation.
[2024-12-21T14:42:17] Face de Pin Sucé: Not possible for now
[2024-12-21T14:42:42] Andrei Albert: Ofc, no one wants to work for free
[2024-12-21T14:43:25] Yamal: ….
[2024-12-21T14:43:57] Yamal: Nobody here has said that they were broken by magic
[2024-12-21T14:43:59] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Yeah the knowledge, the problem on electric stuff is people improvise themselves as technician and electronics, but on mechanic it's the same you have store to sell performance parts, who cost 1500- 10 000€ for one motor parts, and it's 0 warranty and 0 assistance with it, you have to pay company for assembly it for you, and if you do yourself and you broke it's your problem at all, not repair not change for free or even with reduction
[2024-12-21T14:44:10] Yamal: stop the car manes stop it
[2024-12-21T14:44:14] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: I think we have big misunderstood in electric game actually
[2024-12-21T14:44:19] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Ppl need wake-up
[2024-12-21T14:45:36] Yamal: We agree that you pay for everything and that nothing is free

[2024-12-21T14:46:58] Face de Pin Sucé: By the way it is the connector that has canbus
[2024-12-21T14:47:02] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Me i am clear with customer, if you but performance part you assembly yourself it's not warranty at all, mistake or not mistake I can't know I warranty only if it's all my parts assembly by me, in this case I warranty it work perfectly, Otherwise no
[2024-12-21T14:47:28] Yamal: Man
[2024-12-21T14:47:36] Paolo ⁭: Yes salary is the problem.
[2024-12-21T14:48:12] Face de Pin Sucé: Salary is always the problem
[2024-12-21T14:48:13] Yamal: I think he have a problem when he start staling just ask for help,
[2024-12-21T14:48:15] Paolo ⁭: Big company hire with no problem, but small company can't. There's reason
[2024-12-21T14:49:48] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Bug company make bit benefit, it's not with the margin of C350 + the time you loose to explain to customer how to use and config for free that you will her benefit and pay someone haha 😂
[2024-12-21T14:51:01] Paolo ⁭: You don't got me bro, was just talking to hire someone to manage after sales service
[2024-12-21T14:51:02] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: For that it's need to sell 1500€ the pair of controller and sell like +20/month and it will start to be something
[2024-12-21T14:51:25] Paolo ⁭: For the store, not vesc
[2024-12-21T14:52:55] Face de Pin Sucé: I didn't wanted to start a debate 😂 just making things clear about how it works 🫶
[2024-12-21T14:53:09] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: By the way the Torp TC500 was sell at 900€ the contrôler with the wiring for Surro TC500 are 12 mos toll on ims it's the exact typology of C350 then the factory price should be not so far Considering the volume of TC500 it's even more cheap to make than C350 So my estimation is maybe 100€ for factory production cost or even less Sell 900€, they can have very good marketing and after sale service At 400€ not
[2024-12-21T14:54:33] Yamal: everything has become very clear!
[2024-12-21T14:54:46] Paolo ⁭: Actually 30 fet flipsky for 200€ gg
[2024-12-21T14:56:05] 'lekrsu': The support needed to rescue Flipsky systems is a course in electric fire safety
[2024-12-21T14:59:27] GABE: My ximi charger is green when charging my 10s it should be red. But main cell line shows 42v, so clearly it's feeding voltage?,
[2024-12-21T14:59:41] GABE: Do I need to setup jbd BMS to charge or what

[2024-12-21T15:31:04] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: To be honest, it's more or less same, both advantage and disadvantage
[2024-12-21T15:31:08] Yamal: Not about the races a mean
[2024-12-21T15:31:37] @£¥€π.: The regen breaking with the throttle ADC2 works but the pas sensor signal wire has to be connected to ADC1 in order to work with negative values minim 1,50v and maximum 0.01v
[2024-12-21T15:31:43] Yamal: About quality , performance and POWAAAAAARRRRRRrrrRRRRR
[2024-12-21T15:31:44] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Both have customers who kill it 🤣

[2024-12-21T15:34:23] Yamal: Yo use 260A battery ,,?
[2024-12-21T15:34:33] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: C350 have little more caps, technically better mosfets, in practice I guess it's same R350 have nice cnc case, multiple smart latch, 12V3A useful
[2024-12-21T15:34:41] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Yes
[2024-12-21T15:35:04] Yamal: This is more than 3shul

[2024-12-21T15:35:12] Yamal: They use 200A battery right
[2024-12-21T15:35:32] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: I don't talk about claim specs, but until what we push it
[2024-12-21T15:35:45] @£¥€π.: But it does something strange when I release the throttle shortly after breaking it starts on it's oun once

[2024-12-21T15:36:52] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Then advantage for C350 who warranty it for 400A phase, me not
[2024-12-21T15:37:33] Yamal: But you use 400right
[2024-12-21T15:37:39] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: But we both use it at 400A yeah

[2024-12-22T02:11:27] Matthew: I have a single 65h 22x3 winding lonnyo motor and the motor is amazing but if you intend on cruising faster than 35mph it will get hot on you. 22x3 i found out is best for dual motor or if you cruise slower in general and just like to have spirited top speed runs and random acceleration single is fine. If you want to cruise 45mph you most definitely will need to have dual motor in my recent experience. If there's ways I'm doing things wrong I would really like to know because I'm quite a newb to be honest.
[2024-12-22T02:17:48] Matthew: I posted a while back that I get what I'd Iike to describe as a fluttering once I reach a certain speed. I'm using a single ubox 85150 on 18s 90 amp battery 150 amp phase with 70amps fw. Even when fw is turned off I still have the issue. I have a 65h 22x3 lonnyo motor and I had the same issue using a vsett 10+ motor. Going to post a video which the speed run starts almost 10 seconds into the video and approaching speed of ~40mph is when I start having the issue. When I back off the throttle and get back into it sometimes the fluttering completely stops or if not I seem to find a point to hover with the throttle that is just below the "issue" and then towards top speed i can go full throttle without feeling the fluttering. I'm also going to post a bunch of pics of my settings.

[2024-12-22T09:25:20] haku: i shall now welcome thee to the seated 2 gender rider lifestyle. are you ready to take the 2 gender oath of allegiance?
[2024-12-22T09:27:35] Yamal: Haku rider go sleep! XD
[2024-12-22T11:37:39] Rose: Hey there Casper1333, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-12-22T11:54:00] yoann tsobanoglou: Anyone receive seven vesc? Do we have any serious info on the small one ?
[2024-12-22T11:54:46] yoann tsobanoglou: I know @roscheeee pulled the plug on them but he is out currently and don’t want to bother him
[2024-12-22T11:57:12] Yamal: They are very new and expensive controllers,,, still little information, waiting to see if some coffee with croissants mounts them.. xD
[2024-12-22T11:58:04] Yamal: Roscheee where are you?? Maybe he will return in the spring full of strength,?
[2024-12-22T12:00:23] Yamal: Likewise if I had the money I would buy them and draw my own conclusions, possibly landing on the moon
[2024-12-22T12:00:50] Yamal: Ro
[2024-12-22T12:00:50] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-22T12:20:01] David: I'm guessing I can say bye bye to vesc? Showing 14V instead of 80V(20S pack)
[2024-12-22T12:20:09] David: Motor not spinning at all
[2024-12-22T12:37:20] Давно пора: If it's water damage try to dry it
[2024-12-22T12:37:34] Давно пора: And clean boards with alcohol
[2024-12-22T12:48:33] GABE: Hardware store closed on saturday, tf
[2024-12-22T13:06:28] David: No water damage
[2024-12-22T13:44:19] David: Now officially dead haha

[2024-12-22T13:44:27] David: Second cap that blow no reason
[2024-12-22T13:50:11] Yamal: FREE FLIPSKY
[2024-12-22T14:21:28] GABE: @jamessoderstrom
[2024-12-22T14:26:45] GABE: Will stacking a few alu plates here cause issues with heat transfer? I mean, it's a 250w motor, I could be lenient?
[2024-12-22T14:26:57] GABE: Make sandwiches with thermal paste?
[2024-12-22T14:31:35] GABE: We have brought down the schematics to 10mm spacer, @the_hackintosh will print them in the evening for me.
[2024-12-22T14:31:56] GABE: <photos/photo_20310@22-12-2024_14-31-56.jpg>
[2024-12-22T15:12:37] Face de Pin Sucé: Someone told me, they are performing well, not giving me much more informations But they bought 6 few 4 months ago and they got only 2 for now
[2024-12-22T15:23:49] 'lekrsu': Any idea why that is?
[2024-12-22T15:24:47] 'lekrsu': Time to throw the ESC out
[2024-12-22T15:28:45] yoann tsobanoglou: He bought a pair for a client I think, but was going to test them before
[2024-12-22T15:29:32] 'lekrsu': I don't know who runs the site, would like to see numbers and companions to the alternatives.
[2024-12-22T15:31:57] yoann tsobanoglou: Debodgery made an early video review based on images which is not ideal.
[2024-12-22T17:06:22] haku: there is no reviews anywhere for it. so unfortunate
[2024-12-22T17:09:19] Matthew: When something like that happens are you not able to just replace the cap and be good? I'm a newb
[2024-12-22T17:13:24] Matthew: Anyone have an idea to kinda mess with for my settings?
[2024-12-22T17:14:53] 'lekrsu': He did, and another blew.
[2024-12-22T17:33:35] haku: why is flispky so bad? is it the layout?
[2024-12-22T17:33:50] haku: or the parts used?
[2024-12-22T17:41:49] 'lekrsu': Parts
[2024-12-22T17:42:18] haku: what if you upgrade all parts does it still have a good layout?
[2024-12-22T18:15:49] Yamal: <photos/photo_20311@22-12-2024_18-15-49.jpg>
[2024-12-22T18:16:26] haku: push that badboy. can do 25kw
[2024-12-22T18:16:53] haku: nvm no motor temp sensor
[2024-12-22T18:25:21] Yamal: Any ly motor with "10" mm phases would be perfect to get the most out of the controllers and the battery, but I have to focus on the new project, maybe in the future if possible I will put them apart from new bearings and steering axle ^^'
[2024-12-22T18:26:46] GABE: Pro 2 frame seems to not wanna take new tap holes, it may go to the trash
[2024-12-22T18:26:52] GABE: I'm switching too the m365 frame
[2024-12-22T18:27:05] GABE: It has 100% working M3
[2024-12-22T18:27:10] GABE: worthy trade And will be ready sooner Monday I go buy the rest of the solder to solder some P42A and then we ride, ez
[2024-12-22T18:28:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Don't say vescs burn for no reason say some flipskys burn for no reason
[2024-12-22T18:37:41] Yamal: 🔥❤️‍🔥
[2024-12-22T18:41:30] haku: legend has it he is the real santa claus
[2024-12-22T18:42:08] haku: he has chinese elves working hard for christmas to make us happy
[2024-12-22T18:44:38] GABE: M365 frame way cuter
[2024-12-22T18:45:01] GABE: It has 500km solids I think or more I'm talking the risk
[2024-12-22T18:54:20] GABE: <video_file>
[2024-12-22T19:12:30] Yamal: Where is the g30 11” project ?
[2024-12-22T19:13:02] GABE: No welder bro when I get it fixed or a new one I'll make weld up the Battery.
[2024-12-22T19:14:31] Yamal: Anyway your m365 project, Okee for start move in your area and use daly
[2024-12-22T19:17:50] Yamal: He will help you tune the G30 Monster, facilitating quick trips to hardware stores, or aviation stores :)
[2024-12-22T19:28:54] haku: have you diagnosed welder?
[2024-12-22T19:30:02] Mirono escooters: <video_file>

[2024-12-22T19:36:45] haku: those plugs unscrew dude. you didnt have to break it
[2024-12-22T19:37:15] haku: if you look inside its a hex but anyways whats the problem?
[2024-12-22T19:37:26] GABE: Didn't see
[2024-12-22T19:37:38] GABE: <photos/photo_20315@22-12-2024_19-37-38.jpg>
[2024-12-22T19:37:53] haku: is the display not turning on?
[2024-12-22T19:37:58] GABE: it is
[2024-12-22T19:38:00] GABE: just E02
[2024-12-22T19:38:10] GABE: dead communicative Transistor or something
[2024-12-22T19:38:13] GABE: looks bad
[2024-12-22T19:38:15] haku: im not an expert but thats seems to be a mosfet issue like mine
[2024-12-22T19:38:23] GABE: mini one
[2024-12-22T19:38:24] GABE: bad
[2024-12-22T19:38:35] GABE: <photos/photo_20316@22-12-2024_19-38-35.jpg>
[2024-12-22T19:38:37] haku: i had that error before too then they gave me upgraded mosfets
[2024-12-22T19:38:47] GABE: What's the sellers name
[2024-12-22T19:38:59] GABE: I need a whole new ass board bro and that's the whole ass welder
[2024-12-22T19:39:02] haku: let me find out 1 sec
[2024-12-22T19:39:14] GABE: nvm the board is separated into 2 parts
[2024-12-22T19:40:50] haku: i still have beef with this seller because they wont send me caps but atleast my welder working for now. only charges to 5.4v instead of 6v. I just found this on AliExpress: $576.84 | Glitter 811H 811H Battery Aluminum to Copper Battery Spot Welding Machine Large Unit Aluminum to Nickel Welding Equipment https://a.aliexpress.com/_mPqqnnl
[2024-12-22T19:41:16] haku: but they did send all the boards though
[2024-12-22T19:41:30] NetworkDir: yeah but flipsky 75100 😭
[2024-12-22T19:43:03] Mirono escooters: It works
[2024-12-22T19:43:17] NetworkDir: you can't imagine what happend when cutoff?
[2024-12-22T19:43:24] NetworkDir: <sticker>
[2024-12-22T19:44:01] puneDir: Nothing
[2024-12-22T19:44:08] NetworkDir: ?
[2024-12-22T19:44:13] puneDir: It only dies from regen brake cutoff
[2024-12-22T19:44:17] puneDir: Not normal cutoff
[2024-12-22T19:44:20] NetworkDir: No
[2024-12-22T19:44:22] puneDir: Yes
[2024-12-22T19:44:45] puneDir: @Mirono_escooters
[2024-12-22T19:44:49] NetworkDir: You like badass old mans better go sleeping
[2024-12-22T19:45:13] puneDir: No

[2024-12-22T19:46:26] Mirono escooters: Been riding 9 months with one, no die
[2024-12-22T19:46:42] Mirono escooters: Soo, no I don't know
[2024-12-22T19:46:50] puneDir: Try it nothing happens
[2024-12-22T19:46:56] puneDir: Only regen brake cutoff kills it
[2024-12-22T19:47:19] NetworkDir: Depends to luck/speed and saturation
[2024-12-22T19:47:43] Mirono escooters: I must have massive luck
[2024-12-22T19:47:45] Andrei Albert: Spritz night
[2024-12-22T19:47:57] Mirono escooters: Anyway. It's vesc. It's cool. Why this Convo happening
[2024-12-22T19:48:02] puneDir: @NetworkDir
[2024-12-22T19:49:09] NetworkDir: Yeah it's good and cool because their sell it for 1500$ 48V 14Ah batt not bad but using flipsky for product is not good idea at all :D
[2024-12-22T19:49:16] NetworkDir: .
[2024-12-22T19:49:49] puneDir: 🫷
[2024-12-22T20:14:06] haku: i have a very important message later.
[2024-12-22T20:23:27] @£¥€π.: Thanks
[2024-12-22T20:24:28] @£¥€π.: I will try to set it up again
[2024-12-22T20:32:29] Yamal: 85/150?
[2024-12-22T20:33:23] Yamal: Yes,, you just write before ,,👍
[2024-12-22T20:34:09] Yamal: Show your motor man, 65h22/3🫰🤩
[2024-12-22T21:12:05] haku: this is strange. what is this error?
[2024-12-22T21:14:13] haku: i put maximum input voltage at 85v
[2024-12-22T21:20:42] haku: also vesc and bms not reading the same voltage.
[2024-12-22T21:20:43] haku: <photos/photo_20320@22-12-2024_21-20-43.jpg>
[2024-12-22T21:22:40] Yamal: Check your Max V on VESC tool
[2024-12-22T21:23:19] haku: <photos/photo_20321@22-12-2024_21-23-19.jpg>
[2024-12-22T21:23:35] haku: its at 85
[2024-12-22T21:24:40] Yamal: Once it happened to me that the scooter finished charging in the middle of the night, and it was half connected to the charger, and in the morning that error appeared when I picked it up, after the first acceleration it went away,,
[2024-12-22T21:25:29] haku: ill try that. ty
[2024-12-22T21:27:17] haku: it wont let me unfortunately
[2024-12-22T21:27:34] haku: ill ride it later. its just at freespin this happening
[2024-12-22T21:28:03] haku: i dont have regen. very strange error
[2024-12-22T21:29:23] Yamal: Wepoor battery?
[2024-12-22T21:29:40] haku: no lol. we reppin jetsons baby
[2024-12-22T21:29:54] Yamal: Jetson on 20s?
[2024-12-22T21:30:00] haku: yes
[2024-12-22T21:30:21] haku: 1 charger to rule them all
[2024-12-22T21:30:51] Yamal: 35E cells?
[2024-12-22T21:31:19] haku: yep
[2024-12-22T21:31:38] Yamal: Waiting for Wepoor man
[2024-12-22T21:31:50] haku: shit 3p but its okay for short trips aslong as it doesnt overheat.
[2024-12-22T21:32:09] Yamal: Dalydalydaly
[2024-12-22T21:32:36] haku: thats coming. i need to tune this properly before working on wepoor. cant have too many projects or i get sidetracked
[2024-12-22T21:33:04] haku: i have woke es3 and peakg30v2
[2024-12-22T21:33:15] haku: hard to do all at once
[2024-12-22T21:33:21] Yamal: In the end, your vedder speed controllers are not valid for 22s?
[2024-12-22T21:34:21] haku: no. according to foujiwara. but amy told me it can.
[2024-12-22T21:35:22] haku: i will believe mr.foujiwara or james since he knows this mosfets
[2024-12-22T21:36:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: On 72v or any voltage (also is this applicable for the 75200pro v2s?)
[2024-12-22T21:39:10] Finn: My 75100 died because i got a batt cutoff
[2024-12-22T21:39:22] Finn: didnt even drove 1 meter. Had a buggy bms at that time
[2024-12-22T21:50:08] Yamal: What is this ,?
[2024-12-22T22:01:49] Matthew: Oh hell... I thought the video posted
[2024-12-22T22:04:23] Matthew: <video_file>
[2024-12-22T22:08:01] Yamal: Nice hehe
[2024-12-22T22:08:41] Yamal: Your controllers get a little hot, why?
[2024-12-22T22:09:19] Yamal: Do you have a photo of your engines and your scooter?
[2024-12-22T22:10:34] Paolo ⁭: 60 c is ok
[2024-12-22T22:11:26] Yamal: But it wouldn't be the most optimal, considering that we are in winter, right?
[2024-12-22T22:12:27] Paolo ⁭: No problem
[2024-12-22T22:13:12] Matthew: That was a 2nd run at full throttle for about a mile. Then I turned around on the street since it's new and nice and stayed on throttle for a while. I now am very aware of the way I mounted my vesc was completely wrong. I used a thermo epoxy to mount the vesc unit base to the actual deck of the scooter so that's its heat sink.
[2024-12-22T22:13:25] Paolo ⁭: Keep it under 70/80C , but they are made to work up to 100/150C
[2024-12-22T22:13:39] Paolo ⁭: What vesc
[2024-12-22T22:14:57] Yamal: Less temperature = more power, right?
[2024-12-22T22:15:56] Matthew: I think the highest temp my other vesc got up to was 80c but that's because the thermo membrane i had the vesc stuck to to just do some test riding it came off and heated up really fast. The run I posted video of it about the hottest the vesc gets... normal vesc temp while out and about is ~40°c.
[2024-12-22T22:16:17] Yamal: My ubox working below 30°C
[2024-12-22T22:16:45] Yamal: winter, we will see in summer
[2024-12-22T22:17:12] Matthew: My other vesc just shorted out one day riding. Someone says that I likely had a bms cut. Because the inline fuse was fine and the slave vesc was fine. I'm using what was my slave vesc for dual motor.
[2024-12-22T22:17:31] Matthew: Yes, ubox 85150 on 18s
[2024-12-22T22:17:39] Paolo ⁭: Not really
[2024-12-22T22:17:58] Yamal: …
[2024-12-22T22:18:07] Paolo ⁭: It's more about the components life
[2024-12-22T22:18:07] Matthew: Ambient temp here is already 30°c
[2024-12-22T22:18:18] Matthew: I live in Phoenix, az usa
[2024-12-22T22:18:38] Paolo ⁭: But less temp yes you can put more power
[2024-12-22T22:18:58] Yamal: In some vesc specifications they say: - current 300A continuos""" with efficient cooling,,?0
[2024-12-22T22:20:01] Yamal: Yes I see near to Las Vegas 😂
[2024-12-22T22:20:35] Matthew: What the issues I'm running into as the scooter approaches 40mph it starts to flutter and lose power. I can back off the throttle and sometimes get back into full throttle slowly and it will continue to pull nicely. When it flutters I lose power. Most the time I have to back off and then hover my throttle at the point to where it doesn't flutter and eventually I can reach full throttle and it run smoothly
[2024-12-22T22:21:11] Yamal: Wich frame you use
[2024-12-22T22:21:15] Matthew: Yes, it's either comfortable or HOT 🔥
[2024-12-22T22:21:28] Matthew: G30lp

[2024-12-22T22:29:38] Matthew: 180amp battery when I get another 60v battery
[2024-12-22T22:29:38] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Matthew has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-12-22T22:33:25] Yamal: Nice g30 like moto
[2024-12-22T22:35:33] Yamal: rainbow chases you but you are looking for it
[2024-12-22T22:36:41] Yamal: you hate what you can't stop talking and watching
[2024-12-22T22:37:15] Yamal: I hope you're not looking for heels for the end of the year.
[2024-12-22T22:37:23] Yamal: XD
[2024-12-22T22:37:23] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-22T22:37:26] haku: i couldnt say the important message of the day because there are kids around but pretty much im doing 1 rep for every gender while we doing projects and getting swole over here boy.
[2024-12-22T22:37:42] haku: for you yamal. anything
[2024-12-22T22:39:39] Yamal: motivational speech is needed
[2024-12-22T22:41:03] haku: agreed. ill redo video
[2024-12-22T22:43:08] Yamal: By the way, what does the purple and red in your profile photo represent?
[2024-12-22T22:43:32] Yamal: guardians of the galaxy?
[2024-12-22T22:43:42] haku: no idea. i did t make this photo
[2024-12-22T22:44:41] Yamal: Well, anyone who sees your profile photo will think the opposite of what you fight for.
[2024-12-22T22:45:28] Yamal: I told you back in the day, that men grow beards and women grow tits"" don't punish yourself anymore
[2024-12-22T22:45:31] haku: im playing chess while they playing checkers baby
[2024-12-22T22:46:39] Yamal: The Mexican thing is better business friend
[2024-12-22T22:46:41] haku: anyways good to finally go on a park and ride with my boy.
[2024-12-22T22:47:16] Yamal: Peak g30 faster right ?
[2024-12-22T22:49:04] Matthew: That's been the goal. I want legit 100 miles range without having to be so slow to achieve the goal. I like to be able to just plug in when I get home like a normal proper built scooter. I like to have different power sources available. I no longer have to try and yell at people in front of me on the trail to pick a fuckin side to ride or walk on since they're right in the middle swerving slightly side to side. Have headlight and horn wired so far.... I need to get a relay to have my turn signals work and would like to also have a real brake light as I feel pretty sketched out when I need to stop quick in traffic and hope the cars behind me are paying attention to the brake lights on the car in front of me or me have enough space to pull to inside curb to turn.
[2024-12-22T22:52:08] Matthew: The steering damper i need to get a longer travel model. Rn as of for about close to a month now I put a 150mm bolt throught the bottom steering stem to attach the adapter for a steering damper and it actually works the way I feel the damper should be. It gets actual travel now to where as before you rely upon like a .5" travel from left to right turning on the damper.
[2024-12-22T22:53:12] haku: acceleration yes
[2024-12-22T22:56:11] Matthew: Ubox 85150
[2024-12-22T22:56:39] Yamal: very good with that project although this kind of content is better written in the general" channel of scooter vesc group, the admins of this group are all having an early end of the year party xD
[2024-12-22T22:57:09] Paolo ⁭: We maybe misunderstood
[2024-12-22T22:57:17] Yamal: Top speed ?
[2024-12-22T22:57:32] Paolo ⁭: I mean you don't get more power, but you are able to set more power
[2024-12-22T22:58:58] Yamal: but perhaps the continuous power will last longer over time with a cold vedder speed controller:/
[2024-12-22T22:59:24] Yamal: 🤌
[2024-12-22T23:03:33] Yamal: but you are absolutely right, there is power there is unless you upload parameters of your programming if you can upload it
[2024-12-22T23:09:35] Matthew: Me? I posted screenshots of my parameters I'm using. At least I think I posted everything that actually matters
[2024-12-22T23:11:28] Matthew: Seeing if anyone has had a chance to glance the video and my settings to see if there's something that stands out that I should try to change.
[2024-12-22T23:11:29] Matthew: <video_file>
[2024-12-22T23:12:56] Yamal: ask for help in general, post screenshots of the configuration to receive advice ok, but to expand on the projects at length there are the other two channels, it is my opinion, you can write wherever you want ^^',
[2024-12-22T23:14:34] Yamal: For me "vesc help" is a consecrated and expert channel where only magician and magician's apprentice communicate xD, I have a lot of respect for this channel, change and short hiuston
[2024-12-22T23:18:12] Matthew: Post on this group "Vesc Help"? Or post on general discussion vesc?
[2024-12-22T23:18:46] Matthew: All my parameters are loaded on this post above some of our conversations

[2024-12-22T23:24:34] Yamal: We need to know how far it extends or the limits of the "vesc help" channel 3shulc350 on g30/g2.. when?
[2024-12-22T23:27:24] Yamal: You are faster than Lucky Luke, I thought you were in Zamzibar
[2024-12-22T23:30:02] francois schempers: ahah x) well it's open to interpretation, but that channel was originally made to unclog the main chat from dialogues between 2 people, so if you need help, you come here so you don't "polute" the main chat
[2024-12-22T23:30:53] francois schempers: so for me, the Vesc help channel, as long as you need help and it's scooter related, you're good
[2024-12-22T23:31:09] haku: jetson faster cause 72v. it really sucks though. even right now in the park motor overheat
[2024-12-22T23:36:35] Yamal: waiting for your scooter with 3shul
[2024-12-22T23:37:37] Yamal: 🪩
[2024-12-22T23:39:25] haku: g30 motor is really good
[2024-12-22T23:41:47] haku: jetson motor just pure shit
[2024-12-22T23:43:23] haku: yes. gets a bit hot. need to reduce current
[2024-12-22T23:50:37] haku: frame is not even worth it tbh. small battery compartment
[2024-12-22T23:58:43] Matthew: When I start approaching 40mph I get what I'd describe as a fluttering. I lose power when that happens. Sometimes I'm able to just back off the throttle and "slowly" go back to full throttle and the power pulls smoothly and strong. Other times I will slowly get back to full throttle and it will keep having the fluttering issue and I can kinda hover on the throttle just below where it flutters and slowly I'm able to approach top speed and be full throttle and the scooter run SMOOTH.
[2024-12-22T23:59:22] Matthew: What does turning off mtpa do? Why is mtpa seem not for bldc motors?
[2024-12-23T00:00:01] Finn: <photos/photo_20349@23-12-2024_00-00-01.jpg>
[2024-12-23T00:00:51] Matthew: What rear fender are you using 😍
[2024-12-23T00:01:05] Finn: 🤫
[2024-12-23T00:01:27] Finn: Its 72V 30Ah Dual with 2x G30 Controller xD
[2024-12-23T00:02:48] Matthew: What modifications do you do to the controllers to run 72v?
[2024-12-23T00:02:59] Finn: <photos/photo_20350@23-12-2024_00-02-59.jpg>
[2024-12-23T00:03:09] Finn: ADC Swap mosfet swap caps swap and reinforced
[2024-12-23T00:04:50] haku: if it fits ill try. but thats going on the bmx
[2024-12-23T00:05:11] haku: yep
[2024-12-23T00:05:15] Matthew: Nice. Is there a reason you preferred to use factory esc instead of using a vesc unit?
[2024-12-23T00:05:24] Finn: Cheaper
[2024-12-23T00:05:37] Matthew: What rear fender do you have?
[2024-12-23T00:05:39] Finn: works very well. Already burned rear motor ^^
[2024-12-23T00:05:40] haku: that one i really want to rip
[2024-12-23T00:05:46] Finn: Cant say that
[2024-12-23T00:06:35] Matthew: 🥺
[2024-12-23T00:09:29] Paolo ⁭: It is also, if you have enough inductance difference, vescs will advise you too
[2024-12-23T00:11:49] Matthew: I'm using the lonnyo 65h motor. 28 poles has my speed correct
[2024-12-23T00:14:40] Matthew: What about iq measured parameters??
[2024-12-23T00:15:27] Matthew: Say again??
[2024-12-23T00:15:42] Matthew: I'm newb here
[2024-12-23T00:16:56] 'lekrsu': tldr don't use mtpa
[2024-12-23T00:17:46] Matthew: Ok
[2024-12-23T00:18:10] Paolo ⁭: Until you have spintend new fet it doesn't
[2024-12-23T00:18:46] Paolo ⁭: Pushed flipsky 21s with mtpa already, at 400A 12fet
[2024-12-23T00:19:02] Matthew: Bought my 85150 i think was July or August this year
[2024-12-23T00:19:03] Paolo ⁭: And flipsky is One of worst ever controller
[2024-12-23T00:19:20] Paolo ⁭: Yeah 85150 dies with mtpa
[2024-12-23T00:19:43] Matthew: Gotcha.
[2024-12-23T00:20:13] Matthew: That's what I'm trying to figure out. Why is mtpa an issue. I don't know these things??
[2024-12-23T00:20:41] Matthew: Some stuff is read just that conflicting material
[2024-12-23T00:20:50] Matthew: It's off. I'm just curious
[2024-12-23T00:21:04] Paolo ⁭: High Voltage peaks and current peaks
[2024-12-23T00:21:44] Paolo ⁭: It's not problem normally, but new fet is working really near voltage limit
[2024-12-23T00:21:46] Matthew: Ok.
[2024-12-23T00:22:57] Matthew: Do I modify q axis at all?
[2024-12-23T00:23:25] Paolo ⁭: Don't play with mtpa with 85150 if you using 20s
[2024-12-23T00:23:54] 'lekrsu': fast though ))
[2024-12-23T00:24:26] 'lekrsu': Best kind
[2024-12-23T00:33:32] Matthew: What does that accomplish?
[2024-12-23T00:33:59] Matthew: I have it off. I'm hoping that my ride here in a few minutes goes well
[2024-12-23T00:35:01] Matthew: What's the difference on the 2 different types of mtpa available to implement?
[2024-12-23T06:57:26] Yamal: We are almost done with the month and year!!!!!! B where are youuu

[2024-12-23T21:21:16] Finn: And use two wires for temp sensor
[2024-12-23T21:44:20] Yamal: I'm doing it as entertainment during the winter, I'm not in a hurry and I'm also afraid of doing it wrong, because any problem with the phases can break the controllers, and that's not what this is for xD

[2024-12-23T22:58:19] Yamal: I see in some videos scooter group
[2024-12-23T23:00:20] Yamal: Here things are changing quickly, many with large scooters are selling them due to the harassment of fines and the regulations that they promise for 2027
[2024-12-23T23:00:22] ✨🇪🇸عمر: yes 10-15 max 20 people 😭
[2024-12-23T23:00:56] ✨🇪🇸عمر: where are you from?
[2024-12-23T23:01:14] Yamal: Any scooter with a nominal power greater than 1000w will not be able to circulate, however in Portugal it is paradise right now for e-scooters
[2024-12-23T23:01:37] Yamal: Granada Spain
[2024-12-23T23:02:18] Yamal: here in my city if 5 of us get together it is a miracle
[2024-12-23T23:03:39] Yamal: To travel many kilometers, maximum 3 is recommended if not many things can happen, and 1 person cannot commit a group on a long route.

[2024-12-23T23:07:59] Yamal: Me neither, but it is evident that there is something wrong with his legs, I have always liked his revieus and his enthusiastic about them
[2024-12-23T23:09:04] Yamal: You have many scooters in France!
[2024-12-23T23:10:31] ✨🇪🇸عمر: I've never seen it before, in real life I'm quite shy, I've only been to Fastride once and another time to another scooter store
[2024-12-23T23:11:51] ✨🇪🇸عمر: yes we have a bit of everything surron, weped, nami etc... but no langfeite...
[2024-12-23T23:13:25] Yamal: The point is that entering a store full of high-end scooters has to be a treat for the eyes, but in reality when you immerse yourself in the world of modifications they lose incalculable value, whether minimotors, new controllers with simulated sine waves that We see so much that even Kelly is far from your ambition.
[2024-12-23T23:14:37] francois schempers: happy made me some pieces that is welded to the frame to adjust

[2024-12-23T23:16:26] Yamal: shame is a virtue in my opinion
[2024-12-23T23:20:47] Matthew: How well do group scooter rides normally go? People behave themselves and be safe? How are the general public reactions to group rides? Out here I'm at most people are respectful, friendly, safe, and curious. But I think like most anywhere there's times of the day you try to avoid the roads because of the bad road ragers that feel no scooter or bicycle should ever be allowed out... so they're scary delusional.
[2024-12-23T23:26:33] Matthew: G2 frame?

[2024-12-24T02:27:23] Adri: Hello, i just bought ubox 85v 250a controllers, but they are taking voltage error, is there any way to take out the limit or making a custom firmware??!
[2024-12-24T02:42:40] Noname: What voltage battery are you using
[2024-12-24T02:43:18] Adri: 92v battery, but the problem is still the same if i use a 84v battery, because the limit is on 82v
[2024-12-24T02:44:00] Noname: Set max voltage to over what your battery is like 90 for 85v.
[2024-12-24T02:44:29] Adri: Yes, the problem is that the firmware has a limit of that, and i can’t take it out
[2024-12-24T02:44:48] Adri: When i put 92v of limit it stays on 82v

[2024-12-24T05:35:26] Noname: I found a calculator it was 14.8 or something in the 1/4
[2024-12-24T05:36:04] Noname: Bravo 👏 your learning so much
[2024-12-24T05:37:11] Noname: My buddy's 6.0 f350 with a superchip did like a 14.4. That surprised a lot of street cars having ladder racks and paint on the side
[2024-12-24T05:39:53] haku: theres more brains than muscle here bud. dont underestimate my big brain abilities. i can see the future
[2024-12-24T05:40:30] Noname: But I only like you for your body.
[2024-12-24T05:42:43] Noname: Just crazy he's 100ft down track and pulling the front wheel
[2024-12-24T05:42:57] haku: 45h on a big stator is a big motor
[2024-12-24T05:43:32] haku: qs273 45h 50h motors and that can handle some power
[2024-12-24T05:43:44] haku: too bad phase cables are tiny
[2024-12-24T05:46:44] Noname: 4g that I saw
[2024-12-24T05:47:10] Noname: For a 6kw
[2024-12-24T05:47:56] Noname: Same as mine
[2024-12-24T05:48:11] Noname: They must just use stock image for the one black cable then
[2024-12-24T05:48:38] Noname: Freaking 16mm/sq is garden hose size
[2024-12-24T05:48:39] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Noname has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-24T05:49:21] haku: whats the difference with some qs with orange cables?
[2024-12-24T05:50:40] haku: that moped frame is nice too so much room seems like
[2024-12-24T05:51:31] Noname: Idk that's same size but orange. My stock motor is orange cable, mabey looks cool
[2024-12-24T05:52:41] Noname: Could be a cooling issue on bigger motors or noise with that much power
[2024-12-24T05:52:58] haku: wepoor is like that too with 33x2. if you floor the throttle at 30mph the front wheel pops up a bit
[2024-12-24T05:53:28] Noname: Oh god why did I get the torque model
[2024-12-24T05:53:37] haku: kinda scary actually
[2024-12-24T05:53:49] Noname: NPS
[2024-12-24T05:54:03] haku: thats the best one. burnouts for days
[2024-12-24T05:54:30] Noname: How dare you
[2024-12-24T05:54:37] Noname: Ruin a German tire
[2024-12-24T05:54:41] haku: if i can only fit that into any of my frames i would get one.
[2024-12-24T05:55:14] haku: i dont have big dick cash to spend on a emoped or e moto
[2024-12-24T05:56:08] Noname: Eh only part that touches the ground
[2024-12-24T05:56:31] Noname: I swear my pmt's saved my ass
[2024-12-24T05:57:43] haku: too expensive for burnouts
[2024-12-24T05:58:07] Noname: I don't anyway
[2024-12-24T05:58:11] haku: my next non jank project will probably be a midrive. just to see what its all about
[2024-12-24T05:58:36] Noname: Ugh chain noise on a near silent vehicle is horrid
[2024-12-24T05:59:03] haku: thats true. but its also cool you can change gear ratio easily
[2024-12-24T05:59:56] haku: whats nps btw
[2024-12-24T06:00:07] Noname: No pussy shit
[2024-12-24T06:01:25] haku: nah when we speed test we go balls to the walls. i already gave my will to my son. my only assets are 2 70h motors and a laotie frame. the dog will be sold at auction
[2024-12-24T06:02:18] Noname: I have debt and 3 used pev 2 in pieces
[2024-12-24T06:02:29] haku: same haha
[2024-12-24T06:02:42] haku: my son promised to pay the debt
[2024-12-24T06:03:07] Noname: He been racing for cash I see
[2024-12-24T06:03:54] haku: little guy bike is fast. thats also speed limited at 18mph.
[2024-12-24T06:04:21] haku: hes good at riding now
[2024-12-24T06:05:23] haku: he needs a suspension bike now. that can do offroad stuff
[2024-12-24T06:06:34] Noname: I enjoy watching the lil guy ride. Seems to love it
[2024-12-24T06:07:09] haku: yea dude. i built the jetson just so i can keep up with him. i cant even do that. so sad
[2024-12-24T06:07:31] haku: we have same batteries and vesc
[2024-12-24T06:08:01] haku: jetson motor just pure shit
[2024-12-24T06:12:08] Noname: I just found this on AliExpress: $167.74 | 12inch Wheel Hub Motor High Power 48V 72V 1000W 5000W Brushless DC Vacuum Tire Hub Motor for Electric Motorcycle Scooter https://a.aliexpress.com/_m0Rhv0f
[2024-12-24T06:23:58] haku: yea. was looking at that yesterday.
[2024-12-24T06:24:50] Noname: Only other choice it to ram a 6yr old into the ditch
[2024-12-24T06:26:14] haku: if i get that i might need a bigger battery
[2024-12-24T06:26:52] haku: but atleast it wont overheat

[2024-12-24T07:20:59] Yamal: Frame- Motors- Esc-85/250 Battery (cells) even interested in the tire pressure you have XD

[2024-12-24T07:22:44] Yamal: people share very little. little in this group as if they were Cinderella herself xD
[2024-12-24T07:24:01] Yamal: conclusion: - Don't ask someone who lives far north and in the cold to dance on a table because they won't do it.
[2024-12-24T07:24:01] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-24T07:53:38] haku: pedals? are we in 2015? we do legday with weight baby

[2024-12-24T09:30:14] Adri: The battery is from the nami that i have, but is going to be with a molicel battery also but in 84v peak
[2024-12-24T09:37:26] Rose: Hey there solal, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-12-24T09:38:10] ✨🇪🇸عمر: it's so true 🤣🤣 the first time I tested my nami 28ah I thought I was the fastest 🤣🤣
[2024-12-24T09:39:19] ✨🇪🇸عمر: In Paris, unfortunately, it's divided into two groups: the young and the "old". The old spend their time yelling at us because we burn out, we overtake, etc.
[2024-12-24T09:52:23] Face de Pin Sucé: Seriously? 🤣
[2024-12-24T09:52:57] Face de Pin Sucé: Come ride in Lyon with Rage Mechanics team, we will yell at you if you are too slow 😁

[2024-12-24T11:07:19] Patrick: Please cancel it the vesc is bad bad
[2024-12-24T12:13:20] Martin Kaktits: This comment on spintend website under ubox 85v 150A Anyone else gas experience pushing the little thing over 200A phase?

[2024-12-24T12:46:31] Cub🥱: Teverun fighter
[2024-12-24T12:46:44] Cub🥱: Yes exact
[2024-12-24T12:46:55] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Already on the way
[2024-12-24T12:47:05] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Some die some don't
[2024-12-24T12:47:08] Cub🥱: Yes 🥲
[2024-12-24T12:47:15] Yamal: 🏁🗝️🤓🥸
[2024-12-24T12:47:26] Face de Pin Sucé: Rear ?
[2024-12-24T12:47:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I believe in god if he wants my vesc to die I can buy a 3chull and it'll die on bootup
[2024-12-24T12:48:18] Yamal: Flipsky powder ?
[2024-12-24T12:48:27] Cub🥱: No front

[2024-12-24T12:53:12] Face de Pin Sucé: <sticker>
[2024-12-24T12:54:21] Yamal: 70h?
[2024-12-24T12:54:45] Patrick: Yea and the best is when it decides to Block youre motor will driving
[2024-12-24T12:55:32] Patrick: Kinda fun it first Starts to slow down and if you press the throttle the motor Blocks fully
[2024-12-24T12:57:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Depends on the unit depends on the programing
[2024-12-24T12:58:30] Yamal: 22/3 both ?
[2024-12-24T12:59:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like I had 2 75200 V1 and 1 75100 2 84100hp none did problems to me (except then 75100 but did not die) the 75200 both died in someone else's hands because he did not know how to work with vesc or electronics at all
[2024-12-24T13:01:12] Jason: mm
[2024-12-24T13:03:46] Face de Pin Sucé: 75H 33/2
[2024-12-24T13:07:59] Yamal: Wouh

[2024-12-24T13:10:30] ✨🇪🇸عمر: with a little magic it works 🤣
[2024-12-24T13:11:12] Yamal: Can
[2024-12-24T13:11:16] Yamal: Now I remember
[2024-12-24T13:11:30] Yamal: One time I wear 17/4 and 22/3
[2024-12-24T13:11:47] Yamal: But no it’s the good solution
[2024-12-24T13:12:02] Yamal: Better change fron engine
[2024-12-24T13:12:02] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-24T13:13:52] Jason: <photos/photo_20373@24-12-2024_13-13-52.jpg>
[2024-12-24T13:13:56] Paolo ⁭: Contact them and you will know xd
[2024-12-24T13:13:57] Jason: can torture the motor more
[2024-12-24T13:14:02] Jason: rwd more grip
[2024-12-24T13:14:30] bricobi5: the controller no longer wants to turn on it will be changed, but has anyone heard of this before?
[2024-12-24T13:15:07] Paolo ⁭: I hope lol, but them title and description is fraudolent
[2024-12-24T13:16:46] Paolo ⁭: You can just search mt5 on their website, and where the title is mean for full set, price is double
[2024-12-24T13:24:49] ✨🇪🇸عمر: How much temperature do you limit an original engine to?
[2024-12-24T13:24:56] ✨🇪🇸عمر: 90°C?
[2024-12-24T13:53:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What was your setup and was it the Regan brake that killed it?
[2024-12-24T14:00:59] Happy Giraffe: Why would they say brake hose lenght and tell to cut the hose before use if its only lever😁
[2024-12-24T14:02:10] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_20374@24-12-2024_14-02-10.jpg>
[2024-12-24T14:02:41] Happy Giraffe: Also braking pads included so no idea where you git the lever only from😁
[2024-12-24T14:41:12] Patrick: 0 regen, 40A Battery peak, 60-70A phase max & 35A fwk
[2024-12-24T14:41:20] Patrick: Small blade motor
[2024-12-24T14:42:06] Patrick: I cant Tell you why it died 0 cutoffs and 1 day before it fully died the BLE didnt work anymore when driving
[2024-12-24T14:44:54] Paolo ⁭: My bad then, but if they do that it's mean they're broke XD. Because nobody never sold at this price
[2024-12-24T15:22:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Never had that happened but maybe bad components or soldering
[2024-12-24T15:22:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like in their work
[2024-12-24T15:23:56] 'lekrsu': Bad engineering.
[2024-12-24T15:25:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No they just using 2d hand parts (sometimes)
[2024-12-24T15:25:22] Jason: shitsky
[2024-12-24T15:29:27] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Maybe but still everyone else is really expensive
[2024-12-24T15:29:43] 'lekrsu': Bad engineering too.
[2024-12-24T15:29:50] 'lekrsu': Can't defend them.
[2024-12-24T15:29:52] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And there is no reliable way to get spintend to Israel
[2024-12-24T15:30:03] 'lekrsu': Fly abroad and buy a few.
[2024-12-24T15:30:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm not defending I just don't like fear mongering
[2024-12-24T15:30:24] 'lekrsu': And what's stopping normal global import for private individuals?
[2024-12-24T15:31:28] 'lekrsu': Sure, list one product then that inherently isn't inferior to the rest.
[2024-12-24T15:33:02] Jason: mm
[2024-12-24T15:34:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Website doesn't ship to Israel and to trust a random guy to ship u one is not me
[2024-12-24T15:35:10] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also if it'll get cought in customs I'll pay higher price then if the website was shipping it ( also lower shipping cost on website)
[2024-12-24T15:35:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like for example I do trust James but untill he gave me a quote I already ordered from Ali flipsky
[2024-12-24T15:37:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Interior?
[2024-12-24T15:38:03] 'lekrsu': Edit, ^^'
[2024-12-24T15:39:53] 'lekrsu': If the esc breaks, the motor may be at great risk. I don't want to take that risk. Maybe a cheap 50€ Makerbase for cheaper systems where it wouldn't matter too much.
[2024-12-24T16:27:16] Ric.R.M: <photos/photo_20375@24-12-2024_16-27-16.jpg>

[2024-12-24T16:28:44] Ric.R.M: ubox single 80 fw: v6.05 no limits
[2024-12-24T16:29:03] GABE: Seems you didn't flash it
[2024-12-24T16:29:09] GABE: Try again
[2024-12-24T16:29:26] GABE: no limits should rid the fault
[2024-12-24T16:30:42] Ric.R.M: I loaded this firm. without limits and the error remains.
[2024-12-24T16:31:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It's over voltage not over current
[2024-12-24T16:31:58] Patrick: Ordered some too some weeks ago
[2024-12-24T16:32:23] GABE: Ahhh
[2024-12-24T16:33:11] Patrick: Mt5 & MT4 with Shimano BL-8100 and flexsteel you have an great setup for under 150€
[2024-12-24T16:33:12] Ric.R.M: Can I call you on my vesc and resolve it?
[2024-12-24T16:33:44] Ric.R.M: I don't understand much about this.
[2024-12-24T16:34:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Basically You need to set voltage
[2024-12-24T16:34:55] Ric.R.M: ok. i'll try. thanks.
[2024-12-24T16:35:02] yoann tsobanoglou: @PaoloWu I’ve been ordering from them for the past 2 years. Their prices on Magura is unbeatable
[2024-12-24T16:37:43] Paolo ⁭: Where the box?
[2024-12-24T16:37:49] Paolo ⁭: Good to know thanks
[2024-12-24T16:40:00] yoann tsobanoglou: It states on product description: Scope of delivery 1 x MT5e HIGO-Opener 3-Finger Brake Lever Disc Brake 950mm (no box packaging)
[2024-12-24T16:40:51] yoann tsobanoglou: But some offerings have different elements. The last I bought had angle adaptors on levers
[2024-12-24T16:49:37] Ric.R.M: my battery is 28A 20s 100A discharge.
[2024-12-24T16:49:41] Ric.R.M: <photos/photo_20377@24-12-2024_16-49-41.jpg>
[2024-12-24T16:50:20] Ric.R.M: Is this where I have to define it?
[2024-12-24T16:55:21] Ric.R.M: or can you tell me which option is where I change this voltage value?
[2024-12-24T17:01:18] Rose: Hey there Adam, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-12-24T17:02:00] Ric.R.M: what value do I put here?
[2024-12-24T17:02:12] 'lekrsu': How many brakes do you need, ^^
[2024-12-24T17:03:13] yoann tsobanoglou: I bought for friends to group shipping costs 😂
[2024-12-24T17:06:04] yoann tsobanoglou: I ordered again because they have the estop edition on electric
[2024-12-24T17:09:36] yoann tsobanoglou: Look, I always thought it was just sport pads and metal clamp on the levers. But a friend of mine told me they can actually fit 3mm disk without rubbing.
[2024-12-24T17:16:27] Ric.R.M: Thank you very much... it works now.

[2024-12-24T19:03:40] Paolo ⁭: Mt5e and mt5estop is not same
[2024-12-24T19:04:29] yoann tsobanoglou: They have added ebrake switch on estop brakes
[2024-12-24T19:04:59] Paolo ⁭: When
[2024-12-24T19:05:23] Paolo ⁭: Because stock from magura always come without
[2024-12-24T19:05:57] Yamal: Robocop or sine wave
[2024-12-24T19:07:34] yoann tsobanoglou: I don’t know if it’s stock from special order or what. But they have sometimes combinations of brakes that are not available as Magura stock catalog

[2024-12-24T19:16:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes Singapore is sad
[2024-12-24T19:17:01] Yamal: For e-scooter yes ,,
[2024-12-24T19:17:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Almost everything but yes also for pevs
[2024-12-24T19:17:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: How are they still exist?
[2024-12-24T19:17:36] Yamal: Singapore it’s fun
[2024-12-24T19:17:46] Yamal: Many thing interesting
[2024-12-24T19:17:52] Yamal: Yes
[2024-12-24T19:18:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm asking how
[2024-12-24T19:18:25] Yamal: but now almost everything is made to order
[2024-12-24T19:18:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: They must get a lot of orders
[2024-12-24T19:18:59] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Because most stores make more money from local
[2024-12-24T19:19:13] Mirono escooters: High pitched sound?
[2024-12-24T19:28:36] ✨🇪🇸عمر: No, in France a police officer is not like that, the vehicle has a yellow plate, I think in the Netherlands for the moment
[2024-12-24T19:32:06] Apo: They sell it with the lever so there's no difference there
[2024-12-24T19:32:17] Apo: Same lever as mt5e

[2024-12-24T19:57:07] Finn: Lowpass not playin
[2024-12-24T19:59:13] Luis: Hello everybody, Followed all 1zuna guides for connecting xiaomi pro 2 ble to 84100 Vesc. Applied the Lisp M365 Hack, almost everything works on the dis+play now but one detail: throttle works directly to adc but does nothing throught the ble. Brake does nothing also. Ive wired like the top following picture but ignored the bottom one, in 84100 esc what should I do? use just the top or have do make something with the adc pins? Ive tried playi with vesc tool UART APP settings but nothing give any usefull results. Can someone help?
[2024-12-24T19:59:34] Yamal: How much battery and how much phase do they push?
[2024-12-24T20:00:08] 'lekrsu': I'll use XT90 and XT150, just waiting for parts rn
[2024-12-24T20:00:20] 'lekrsu': These were used on Ninebot stock motors
[2024-12-24T20:00:29] Finn: How much cans can it push
[2024-12-24T20:00:37] 'lekrsu': one apparently)
[2024-12-24T20:00:46] Yamal: But you don’t know from other scooter ,,?
[2024-12-24T20:00:59] Luis: break doesnt work either
[2024-12-24T20:01:11] Yamal: A battery A phase
[2024-12-24T20:01:24] Yamal: Safe max configuration,,?
[2024-12-24T20:01:26] Luis: is like the UART comms is being ignored
[2024-12-24T20:01:58] 'lekrsu': Oh, the alu lite generally? Firmware limited to 150A
[2024-12-24T20:02:31] Luis: i think that, if connected directly toi ESC, the comms is done using adc, but if comming through BLE, the comms should come via UART protocols
[2024-12-24T20:03:10] Yamal: Battery and phase same ?
[2024-12-24T20:03:22] Finn: 100A batt 150A phase
[2024-12-24T20:03:33] Yamal: Nice
[2024-12-24T20:03:49] Yamal: Like Tronic 250 xD
[2024-12-24T20:04:12] 'lekrsu': I think it was symmetric 150A on both as per limits but it's not reasonable to do 150A on 6 fet
[2024-12-24T20:04:37] 'lekrsu': But 5000-10000w for 100€? Can't complain
[2024-12-24T20:05:24] yoann tsobanoglou: I wouldn’t try higher than 150 on the lite. We pushed a vsett to 180/200 and rear controller mosfets gave up after 400kms
[2024-12-24T20:05:59] yoann tsobanoglou: <video_file>
[2024-12-24T20:06:09] yoann tsobanoglou: Racing against nami
[2024-12-24T20:06:12] Yamal: You have Nami with 85/250 or I dream?
[2024-12-24T20:07:14] yoann tsobanoglou: I have, but I build many vesc scooters here
[2024-12-24T20:07:34] Yamal: Greece right
[2024-12-24T20:07:51] Yamal: Wich power VESC do you try
[2024-12-24T20:08:41] yoann tsobanoglou: I currently have built a e-bike with 750amp bafang cargo hub motor with ubox 85v150a and made 8800watts on it
[2024-12-24T20:09:17] 'lekrsu': On the alu lite, why?
[2024-12-24T20:09:29] 'lekrsu': Makes no sense
[2024-12-24T20:10:16] yoann tsobanoglou: <video_file>
[2024-12-24T20:10:48] yoann tsobanoglou: Because we needed to look stock on 72v battery
[2024-12-24T20:10:53] yoann tsobanoglou: No space
[2024-12-24T20:11:24] 'lekrsu': shouldn't have ran no-limit firmware that high then
[2024-12-24T20:11:42] yoann tsobanoglou: And lisp code to work with vsett screen and lights
[2024-12-24T20:12:03] Yamal: Alu lite monster nice to see
[2024-12-24T20:12:06] haku: today is christmas eve in america and happen to fall on a monday wich is good because monday is deadlift day. we doing real projects and getting swole for santa boy.
[2024-12-24T20:12:17] yoann tsobanoglou: We ran no limit, now we even changes mosfets on it with the ones from the 85v250a brother
[2024-12-24T20:13:55] Yamal: Some e-scooter with 33/2 engines ,,?
[2024-12-24T20:17:16] yoann tsobanoglou: Which one ? 70h, 75h or 80h ? 3 builds ongoing
[2024-12-24T20:17:48] Yamal: winding I mean
[2024-12-24T20:18:15] Finn: Doing 180 on 6fet. James did 220 on 6fet😄
[2024-12-24T20:18:32] yoann tsobanoglou: <video_file>
[2024-12-24T20:18:37] yoann tsobanoglou: This one is the smaller project with 70h on 20s battery
[2024-12-24T20:18:41] 'lekrsu': I'll feel fine continuing the torture of lite then, ;)
[2024-12-24T20:18:56] Yamal: But 22/3 right
[2024-12-24T20:18:57] Finn: I have 165 on my lite
[2024-12-24T20:19:12] Yamal: I remember, nice scooter
[2024-12-24T20:19:15] 'lekrsu': Did you steal that road tester from the spanish police or what
[2024-12-24T20:19:15] Finn: Motor cant handle more. Saturation😭
[2024-12-24T20:19:18] 'lekrsu': 🥹
[2024-12-24T20:19:36] yoann tsobanoglou: Not this one is 33/2- it reaches top speed.
[2024-12-24T20:20:06] yoann tsobanoglou: Mine was another video, tuner is a friends friend who allows us to use roller sometimes
[2024-12-24T20:20:41] Yamal: 70h / ubox 85/250?
[2024-12-24T20:20:49] Yamal: 20s10p?
[2024-12-24T20:21:55] yoann tsobanoglou: No 70h with Kelly 7218s 20s10p with lg 15amp cells so no torture available
[2024-12-24T20:22:09] Yamal: :(
[2024-12-24T20:22:19] Yamal: Mount ubox on THAT!!!!
[2024-12-24T20:22:26] Yamal: <sticker>
[2024-12-24T20:22:58] Yamal: Oh not power cells ,,?
[2024-12-24T20:23:00] yoann tsobanoglou: Th
[2024-12-24T20:23:09] yoann tsobanoglou: Then the biggest pain in my ass
[2024-12-24T20:23:12] Yamal: Also weped !!!!

[2024-12-24T20:23:40] yoann tsobanoglou: It’s just fucking problem after problem
[2024-12-24T20:23:44] Yamal: Weped ?
[2024-12-24T20:23:49] yoann tsobanoglou: Yes
[2024-12-24T20:24:07] Yamal: Nice man many scooter thanks for share
[2024-12-24T20:25:21] Yamal: 3shull / x12 or seven on the island,?
[2024-12-24T20:26:50] yoann tsobanoglou: X12 is shit, I would not use it even on rolling garbage bin - 3schull only
[2024-12-24T20:29:36] yoann tsobanoglou: And the 80h still in box
[2024-12-24T20:30:37] puneDir: <photos/photo_20389@24-12-2024_20-30-37.jpg>

[2024-12-24T20:30:50] puneDir: But i need that frame
[2024-12-24T20:30:52] puneDir: Where can i find
[2024-12-24T20:31:00] puneDir: Or anyone have models for it so i can diy it
[2024-12-24T20:31:00] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. puneDir has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-24T20:35:20] Yamal: Why ?
[2024-12-24T20:36:26] Yamal: interested in your explanation and response
[2024-12-24T20:37:23] Yamal: It is one of the current giants, and there are already people using it
[2024-12-24T20:38:14] Yamal: 12 Infineon tolt so it is a pleasure to compile experiences with these new Tronic
[2024-12-24T20:40:59] Yamal: XD
[2024-12-24T20:40:59] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-24T21:01:50] yoann tsobanoglou: When needed to tune tronics, their motor detection sucks, halls often fail to be detected without explanation. Phase amps software limits are not followed. If you push battery amps all hell breaks loose. And worse of all, gate noise! Sorry but not a fan! Components may be of quality, but they need to up their game with support and optimisation.
[2024-12-24T21:03:39] Yamal: 🤐
[2024-12-24T21:04:24] Yamal: Incredibly, I had heard about the halls in other cases,,,
[2024-12-24T21:04:54] Yamal: For now ruled out until proven otherwise, thank you very much
[2024-12-24T21:05:26] Yamal: I also heard that it can withstand 500 phase
[2024-12-24T21:07:40] yoann tsobanoglou: So does 3schull
[2024-12-24T21:09:44] Yamal: There is a lot of information and experiences about 3shul, they are very contrasted, and it should be noted that the fastest scooter in the world on 11" rides 3shul
[2024-12-24T21:10:40] Yamal: waiting for the giant seven
[2024-12-24T21:10:46] Yamal: What he can do
[2024-12-24T21:11:39] Yamal: I also find the mp2s very interesting and of course R350‼️❗️
[2024-12-24T21:22:54] haku: we feast tonight boys
[2024-12-24T21:24:16] Yamal: Woyoyoy

[2024-12-24T21:27:54] haku: the bomber frame very old though. you can diy better than that
[2024-12-24T21:29:27] puneDir: Any 3d models availabel?
[2024-12-24T21:30:03] haku: not that i know off.
[2024-12-24T21:58:21] Rose: Hey there Hohn, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-12-24T22:32:13] haku: @PaoloWu you cook real good yea? like a chef? do you use souvide?
[2024-12-24T22:33:12] Paolo ⁭: I am chef lol

[2024-12-24T22:37:28] haku: fuck it. its already cooking too late now
[2024-12-24T22:39:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Not everyone has money for 3chull
[2024-12-24T22:43:04] yoann tsobanoglou: Ok
[2024-12-24T23:24:01] ✨🇪🇸عمر: in ''control types'' do you have adc and uart?
[2024-12-24T23:24:09] ✨🇪🇸عمر: Or just uart
[2024-12-24T23:37:20] Luis: hey! I ve done several times, all the tests I could imagine. I am following strictly the 1zuna video so I am using now only ADC in "APP to use". DUMB me but Ive started having feedback after connecting the"stream realtime data and stream realtime app data"!!!!! Oh my god Ive missed those options until now.........
[2024-12-24T23:57:34] Yamal: VESC boys tomorrow holidays 🔥🎉
[2024-12-25T00:00:01] Yamal: and Benjamin, has anyone seen it yet?
[2024-12-25T00:07:42] haku: not yet. but i prepared cookies and milk
[2024-12-25T00:12:51] Yamal: I'm thinking that he could organize a Vesc week, a good opportunity to get to know each other and put our cards on the table.
[2024-12-25T00:17:53] Yamal: I'm just a little lazy to send an email and try to find it, but I know it can be found!
[2024-12-25T00:19:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yep tomorrow hunnuka
[2024-12-25T00:19:57] Yamal: I know I only need 3' of your time, only 3'
[2024-12-25T00:22:33] Yamal: A pure and uncut vesc movement is being generated that is unstoppable and BV has to be aware of it
[2024-12-25T00:25:57] Paolo ⁭: @Bradhaku trying to break the another arm😂
[2024-12-25T00:26:34] Yamal: Imagine that you create something that is breaking and taking electric mobility to an extreme level, yet you turn a deaf ear and worry about burning logs like scraping them in a good fire and you live as if it were not the issue with you. he is the fucking master
[2024-12-25T00:26:38] Yamal: You,,?
[2024-12-25T00:26:46] Yamal: 🤣
[2024-12-25T00:28:14] Paolo ⁭: Yes🤣
[2024-12-25T00:28:38] Yamal: ….

[2024-12-25T00:29:44] Yamal: What do you intend to injure yourself?
[2024-12-25T00:30:29] Yamal: In any case you train and that is = health, well done Mr Paolo
[2024-12-25T00:30:50] Paolo ⁭: I've one arm broken
[2024-12-25T00:31:07] Paolo ⁭: U can see plaster
[2024-12-25T00:31:18] Paolo ⁭: That's why doing single arm lift lol
[2024-12-25T00:32:02] Yamal: Yeah! and from what I see you want to break the other one, tired of the kitchen or what? you know more than the bad guy's horse xD
[2024-12-25T00:32:36] Yamal: luckily your back stays straight xD
[2024-12-25T00:32:43] haku: good grip dude!
[2024-12-25T00:33:17] Yamal: Big Paolo
[2024-12-25T00:33:37] Yamal: reminds me of bruce lee

[2024-12-25T00:40:25] haku: how do you guys fix a bent rotor? too poor to replace it. 😭
[2024-12-25T00:42:32] haku: and how does a rotor warp like that? it was straight when i first running it
[2024-12-25T00:51:58] Paolo ⁭: 120kg but with strap😂
[2024-12-25T00:52:26] Paolo ⁭: Wrist break
[2024-12-25T00:54:51] Yamal: Come on, now everyone trains in the gym

[2024-12-25T00:58:42] haku: you can train anywhere it doenst need to be in the gym. thats why i make those videos

[2024-12-25T07:15:59] Yamal: By the way, it would be very nice to be able to see MP2 controllers like the one Jason Bourne has taken to the extreme,,, that is, to be able to see them working with batteries and large motors...
[2024-12-25T07:15:59] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2024-12-26T13:52:07] puneDir: Yes
[2024-12-26T13:55:08] Yamal: :(
[2024-12-26T13:55:18] Yamal: Off road 24/7?
[2024-12-26T13:59:55] Давно пора: That is a nice hit

[2024-12-26T15:38:08] No: Hi guys, can someone help me ? My battery is 85v full and my flipsky only takes 84v. It worked when the battery was half empty but now it seems to protect it self but I can't even save my 84v max battery value... any help would be appreciated 🤞🏻
[2024-12-26T15:38:42] GABE: No limits firmware
[2024-12-26T15:39:04] GABE: with flipsky I wouldn't do 21s even.
[2024-12-26T15:39:12] GABE: I'd run 16s
[2024-12-26T15:41:26] No: By "s" do you mean series of cells?
[2024-12-26T15:41:38] GABE: yes
[2024-12-26T15:41:39] GABE: ofc
[2024-12-26T15:43:26] No: Charged it full, then I used voltmeter and it said 67v when empty and 85 when full
[2024-12-26T15:47:28] No: I think my voltmeter was faulty, I used another one and it says 72v now
[2024-12-26T15:47:50] No: It's supposed to be a normal 20s 😅
[2024-12-26T15:48:52] No: But now it's more curious, I really don't get what the problem is
[2024-12-26T15:49:18] No: <photos/photo_20420@26-12-2024_15-49-18.jpg>
[2024-12-26T15:49:45] 'lekrsu': 20S shouldn't charge to 85V. Is your multimeter broken?
[2024-12-26T15:50:38] No: I think so
[2024-12-26T15:50:50] 'lekrsu': If your multimeter is off by that much, xD, swap the batteries in it or throw it away
[2024-12-26T15:52:54] No: You know what ? I think I dont know how to use it, I wanted to take a picture for you guys and now it says 84 again (with the other voltmeter)
[2024-12-26T16:00:53] GABE: Can with the 'right" charger
[2024-12-26T16:01:10] GABE: 4.25v is total max
[2024-12-26T16:01:20] GABE: 4.4v u looking at dropping the cycles to 3 individual cycles
[2024-12-26T16:01:21] GABE: Haha
[2024-12-26T16:02:57] francois schempers: is anyone familiar with kuririn g2 max and what kind of battery space you have inside ?
[2024-12-26T16:03:27] No: Im using bluetooth and mobile app, should I install it from a computer ?
[2024-12-26T16:03:38] GABE: Better sure
[2024-12-26T16:03:42] GABE: mac doesn't work fyi
[2024-12-26T16:05:42] No: So you say it would allow to use the hardware at it's max capacity without safety error ? Sorry I may be little slow sometimes
[2024-12-26T16:09:03] Tristan: I only have a Kukirin G4 and Estift doesn't have a kugoo
[2024-12-26T16:14:57] Patrick: Nothing will make me ever buy a kugoo
[2024-12-26T16:21:27] francois schempers: we agree upon that xD but that's what my friend have, so lets upgrade it ^^
[2024-12-26T16:35:23] Yamal: esc/battery/motors pack to avoid crying is the best...
[2024-12-26T17:48:01] No: Well, no limit is installed and max voltage is set but nothing happens when I pull the throttle... just gonna Check the settings to be sure everything is correct
[2024-12-26T17:56:34] 'lekrsu': Did you configure your throttles?
[2024-12-26T17:58:22] No: I did it twice since the new firmware, didn't changed anything but as Im a bit stubborn I tried a third time
[2024-12-26T18:00:20] No: And it works now... next thing on the list, I would try to connect my LCD4 display, does anyone know if this wiring diagram is correct ?
[2024-12-26T18:01:02] No: Do I need to install something more on the vesc to get both running together ?

[2024-12-26T19:47:22] puneDir: White one
[2024-12-26T19:51:11] haku: just get a qs motor and get on with it.
[2024-12-26T19:51:23] haku: im sure you can source some local
[2024-12-26T19:56:58] haku: boys got a question. how reliable is mini ubox? im thinking about downgrading the peak g30 and jetson to mini ubox and put 2 85/150 on the mini bmx peak g30v2 and use the old dual 100/100v2 on some other project
[2024-12-26T19:57:40] haku: im not using the full power of the 85/150 so its pretty much wasted
[2024-12-26T20:05:31] Noname: Run what you have purchase more when needed
[2024-12-26T20:11:12] haku: true. ill try to push the old 100/100 v2 first see how it does
[2024-12-26T20:11:45] haku: i feel like the 85/150 is wasted on these batteries and motors on the jetson and peak g30
[2024-12-26T20:11:52] Noname: They are
[2024-12-26T20:12:36] Noname: Can you put enough battery on the Lil bike to punish the 100
[2024-12-26T20:13:27] haku: that peak g30v2 will rip. i want p42 on that and a 300a ant bms
[2024-12-26T20:14:14] Noname: Idk how deep is your wallet?
[2024-12-26T20:14:34] haku: i might even use the 40t thats just sitting on the table not used and bag it. then run that
[2024-12-26T20:14:42] haku: not deep. but i have parts
[2024-12-26T20:14:59] Noname: For more controllers I mean
[2024-12-26T20:15:13] haku: mini spintend is the cheapest one
[2024-12-26T20:16:25] haku: thats why i go with spintend. quality thats affordable
[2024-12-26T20:17:04] haku: or maybe i should baptize that bike in fardrivers
[2024-12-26T20:18:08] haku: I just found this on AliExpress: $48.16 | 72V 35A ND7235 Fardriver Controller Without Bluetooth https://a.aliexpress.com/_mrJzpgJ
[2024-12-26T20:27:51] Noname: <animation>

[2024-12-27T07:23:27] Yamal: Nice car man
[2024-12-27T07:23:30] haku: 1800 phase amps
[2024-12-27T07:23:49] Yamal: Compare with ?
[2024-12-27T07:24:01] haku: shul
[2024-12-27T07:24:10] Noname: Ramp
[2024-12-27T07:24:26] Yamal: More powa?
[2024-12-27T07:24:34] Yamal: 1000vs1800?
[2024-12-27T07:24:43] haku: im not sure how much phase the shul does
[2024-12-27T07:25:10] Yamal: They say 1000
[2024-12-27T07:25:14] haku: isnt it 1000 battery
[2024-12-27T07:25:20] Yamal: But the true max don’t know
[2024-12-27T07:25:28] Yamal: I mean phase man
[2024-12-27T07:25:36] Noname: The price omg
[2024-12-27T07:25:38] Yamal: I search
[2024-12-27T07:25:40] haku: theres even a 2600 fardriver
[2024-12-27T07:26:06] haku: china market only i think
[2024-12-27T07:26:53] Noname: I saw a huge one on the Indonesia scooter vids.
[2024-12-27T07:27:09] haku: maybe thats it.
[2024-12-27T07:27:12] haku: 2600
[2024-12-27T07:27:23] Yamal: C version
[2024-12-27T07:28:12] Yamal: Man it’s in the photo before
[2024-12-27T07:28:16] Yamal: All they say
[2024-12-27T07:28:26] Yamal: Battery and phase ^^'
[2024-12-27T07:28:45] haku: these fardrivers shiity engineering ive heard shit software. but shit tons of mosfets
[2024-12-27T07:28:49] Yamal: Also there are 1400 3shull
[2024-12-27T07:29:01] Noname: My friends use them
[2024-12-27T07:29:11] haku: wich one?
[2024-12-27T07:29:48] Noname: Nick and Brian
[2024-12-27T07:29:58] haku: i mean wich fardriver
[2024-12-27T07:30:00] Noname: 😆
[2024-12-27T07:30:09] Noname: I don't know off hand
[2024-12-27T07:30:18] Yamal: 700 battery 1400phase bailalo
[2024-12-27T07:31:15] haku: someday when i have all the vesc knowledge i will find a way to jank a vesc logicboard into a fardriver 2600 powerstage
[2024-12-27T07:33:21] haku: i might need all the vesclords knowledge for that
[2024-12-27T07:35:07] haku: you guys think BV will like that idea? or will he banish me into the woke prison
[2024-12-27T07:42:02] haku: Noname this is the one you so those thai ladyboys riding?https://www.cnqsmotor.com/product/fardriver-controller-nd722600-nd842600-nd962600-sine-wave-controller/
[2024-12-27T07:42:03] Yamal: Ask him
[2024-12-27T07:43:14] Noname: Idk just saw a fardriver the size of a Bible 😆
[2024-12-27T07:44:10] haku: look at the reccomended motor.
[2024-12-27T07:44:41] haku: perfect for your niu
[2024-12-27T07:45:55] Noname: I don't want to know the price
[2024-12-27T07:48:42] Noname: I think getting a cheeseburger in the neighboring state and making it home without charging is gonna have to be enough for now
[2024-12-27T07:49:00] haku: ive never seen anyone on youtube run this yet. maybe theres some bit they keep.itna secret for some reason
[2024-12-27T07:49:37] Noname: Idk they seem to have smaller motors that fly. Mabey weight?
[2024-12-27T07:49:45] haku: im completely fine with 72v vesc jetson with now 4 piston brakes haha
[2024-12-27T07:50:28] Noname: Not sure I want to drive a shitty plastic moped with 25kw
[2024-12-27T07:50:51] haku: i would
[2024-12-27T07:51:16] haku: so much torque the chasis bent -dominic torreto
[2024-12-27T07:51:35] Noname: Well I have a few miles on it and I'd find a better frame honestly. Would need a gas conversion.
[2024-12-27T07:51:59] Noname: No off the shelf elec frame is gonna be good
[2024-12-27T07:52:05] haku: honda ruckus with one of these motors would kick ass
[2024-12-27T09:43:17] Noname: Found one
[2024-12-27T11:18:59] KierreKikkeli: Cursed

[2024-12-27T19:58:26] Pandalgns: sorry to the mks haters 😃
[2024-12-27T19:59:44] Yamal: Wouh
[2024-12-27T20:00:26] Yamal: Max battery A Max phase A Safe””????? :)
[2024-12-27T20:00:40] Pandalgns: I dont know 😂😂😂
[2024-12-27T20:00:45] Yamal: :(
[2024-12-27T20:03:34] Pandalgns: I don't know about the battery, the manufacturer doesn't specify it, I'm worried 😂😂 about the phase, according to the manufacturer, 200 continuous 300 peak but I think you can get more
[2024-12-27T20:04:36] Pandalgns: If I am putting continuous 200 phases into the 84100 and it does not heat up, I think that 350 400 continuous phases will support me 🙄🙄
[2024-12-27T20:06:31] Pandalgns: The truth is that I picked them up this morning at the courier office and I just opened them now, they look good, they are big, robust, they weigh a little, 6awg cables... let's see what results they give
[2024-12-27T20:14:17] Yamal: From what I have in the memory album, we know that 12 mosfets work at 300A safe phase, I think that the limits of safe work in Vesc are something necessary to know and very interesting, both for battery and phase, I with ubox 12, I know I could work at 200A battery and 300 phase safely
[2024-12-27T20:15:28] Pandalgns: From what I understand, this version of mks I think they are "clones" of the ubox so I imagine it will have similar parameters
[2024-12-27T20:16:07] Yamal: Afterwards it is clear that this optimal performance may vary depending on the mounting and dissipation,,,
[2024-12-27T20:16:55] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_20456@27-12-2024_20-16-55.jpg>

[2024-12-27T20:16:55] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_20458@27-12-2024_20-16-55.jpg>
[2024-12-27T20:17:31] Pandalgns: Probablemente buena disipación, las 84100 las pruebas que les hice sacándole jugo a los parámetros, ni se calientan, y van dentro del chasis de xiaomi
[2024-12-27T20:17:35] Yamal: Mount on Halo?
[2024-12-27T20:18:17] Yamal: looking for maverick
[2024-12-27T20:18:19] haku: thats a big boy
[2024-12-27T20:18:32] Pandalgns: The 84200?? Yes, they are for the halo
[2024-12-27T20:18:44] 'lekrsu': Palabras en español muy confusas
[2024-12-27T20:19:03] Pandalgns: Oh shit I didn't translate it
[2024-12-27T20:19:05] Pandalgns: 😂😂😂
[2024-12-27T20:19:20] Yamal: 你在说什么？
[2024-12-27T20:19:21] 'lekrsu': I know some Spanish so my brain just breaks twice reading it
[2024-12-27T20:19:28] Pandalgns: Probably good dissipation, the tests I did on the 84100 taking advantage of the parameters, they don't even heat up, and they go inside the Xiaomi chassis
[2024-12-27T20:20:16] haku: in the US spanish is the 2nd biggest language
[2024-12-27T20:20:17] Pandalgns: Sorry guys, I didn't realize I sent it without translating 😂😂
[2024-12-27T20:20:48] Yamal: By the way, do you know that the current population of India is already larger than that of China? therefore 3shul has gained power
[2024-12-27T20:21:12] Yamal: XD
[2024-12-27T20:21:13] Yamal: Curry
[2024-12-27T20:21:20] 'lekrsu': Also the fourth most spoken language
[2024-12-27T20:21:31] 'lekrsu': 500 million people, more than the entire US population
[2024-12-27T20:22:23] 'lekrsu': 中国第一
[2024-12-27T20:22:45] Pandalgns: We should have a Spanish speaking chat in this group 😜😜
[2024-12-27T20:23:16] Yamal: 顺便问一下，你在附近见过本杰明吗？
[2024-12-27T20:25:01] Yamal: Mamasita
[2024-12-27T20:49:04] Pandalgns: What do you think about these mosfets?
[2024-12-27T20:49:22] Face de Pin Sucé: No problem
[2024-12-27T20:49:27] haku: thats the same mosfets i have
[2024-12-27T20:49:44] Pandalgns: On which controller?
[2024-12-27T20:50:07] haku: spintend
[2024-12-27T20:50:20] haku: the new powerstage i have
[2024-12-27T20:50:48] Pandalgns: Ohhh I have 2 of those same ones on my Xiaomi hehehe, what do you think about this series (84hp) of mks controllers?
[2024-12-27T20:51:20] haku: <photos/photo_20249@21-12-2024_17-59-12.jpg>
[2024-12-27T20:51:20] Pandalgns: I'm glad to know that mks mounts the same mosfets as spinted
[2024-12-27T20:51:57] haku: no this is a different powerstage. not on regular 12fets
[2024-12-27T20:52:18] haku: its a special order from a customer
[2024-12-27T20:52:37] haku: regular 12 fet powerstage doesnt use HY
[2024-12-27T20:53:05] Pandalgns: What do you want to tell me?? Are these better than the regular ones that spinted uses?
[2024-12-27T20:54:02] haku: what im trying to say the powerstage i have is a special order from spintend. regular 85/250 doesnt come with these mosfets
[2024-12-27T20:54:17] haku: i have no idea if its good or not. but we will test
[2024-12-27T20:54:40] haku: the old one was solid. can take 250 bat/300 phase
[2024-12-27T20:56:35] Pandalgns: So I understand that mks is making good controllers with good components, right?
[2024-12-27T20:56:56] haku: no idea. never tested one. personally
[2024-12-27T20:57:06] haku: i want to test one in the future
[2024-12-27T20:57:41] Pandalgns: There is still time until my halo is finished and I can try them, but I will tell you what the results are.
[2024-12-27T20:57:43] haku: but im spintend fanboy. but anything with vesc im a fan
[2024-12-27T20:58:24] haku: im a simple man. i only know 2 genders. but im open to any controllers
[2024-12-27T20:59:35] Pandalgns: 😂😂 you are open minded with the controllers hahaha
[2024-12-27T21:01:41] haku: if i have money. i will test all of em. but no monies
[2024-12-27T21:07:06] Pandalgns: I understand you, I'm kind of poor 😂
[2024-12-27T21:07:39] Yamal: +1
[2024-12-27T21:10:00] haku: can i please see the layout of the mks powerstage
[2024-12-27T21:12:05] Pandalgns: I tried to disassemble the logic part from the power part but I am not able to separate them, I don't know if I have to pull hard, desolder or what I have to do

[2024-12-27T21:18:26] Jason: at least dose some silkscreen arts lmao
[2024-12-27T21:19:31] haku: do you know of the new spintend 12fet comes with hy fets?
[2024-12-27T21:20:47] Jason: was those fets
[2024-12-27T21:20:50] Jason: 308a or 380a
[2024-12-27T21:20:54] Jason: datasheet max
[2024-12-27T21:21:04] haku: no idea
[2024-12-27T21:21:20] Jason: part number
[2024-12-27T21:21:57] haku: im a noob when it comes to specs of microcomponents
[2024-12-27T21:22:12] Jason: HYG015N10 100v 380a
[2024-12-27T21:22:15] Pandalgns: If I'm not mistaken because of some comment that punedir said at the time, I think these mosfets are 380a
[2024-12-27T21:26:53] haku: your 18fet design what mosfets?
[2024-12-27T21:27:22] haku: i have to do some research on this stuff
[2024-12-27T21:28:10] Jason: toll
[2024-12-27T21:28:26] haku: wich ones?
[2024-12-27T21:28:47] Jason: any
[2024-12-27T21:28:56] Jason: user choice but prob gonna be same
[2024-12-27T21:29:00] Jason: HYG015N10
[2024-12-27T21:29:01] haku: is toll a brand? i thought its the style of mosfets
[2024-12-27T21:29:08] Jason: yep
[2024-12-27T21:29:11] Jason: style of mosfets
[2024-12-27T21:29:26] Jason: it's name of the package to be precise
[2024-12-27T21:29:32] haku: gotcha
[2024-12-27T21:29:51] haku: lots to learn in this i depth microconpoments stuff
[2024-12-27T21:29:58] Face de Pin Sucé: I have this one on my desk since 2 weeks, didn't have time yet to test it
[2024-12-27T21:31:03] haku: so pretty much the main thing is. these mosfets have to have a good path and cooling yea
[2024-12-27T21:33:01] Pandalgns: At the moment what I have tried on my Xiaomi works quite well, 14s dual motor 1000w each motor, 180a phase, about 70kmh plus less and very good acceleration
[2024-12-27T22:06:02] Yamal: The one of uboX,,?

[2024-12-27T22:31:03] ✨🇪🇸عمر: 240a and 250a
[2024-12-27T22:49:19] haku: to the experienced guys that know mosfets wich one is better this or HY?

[2024-12-27T23:32:32] haku: i wish foc forever was still here to open and review this stuff. RIP legend
[2024-12-27T23:36:24] Noname: Yeah they went out of business. I saw a cake irl. Not the dirtbike one though
[2024-12-27T23:37:13] Noname: This weird ass thing
[2024-12-27T23:37:56] haku: very modern look
[2024-12-27T23:40:23] Noname: Damn Swedish designers. Think IKEA had a hand on it
[2024-12-27T23:40:53] haku: it does look like an ikea product haha
[2024-12-27T23:41:12] Noname: It's modular for seats or cargo
[2024-12-27T23:41:21] haku: i like the battery space
[2024-12-27T23:43:00] Noname: I like the dirtbike but designers fell asleep on their arms before drafting this thing apparently
[2024-12-27T23:43:24] GABE: Company make an electric vehicle look normal challenge (literally impossible) (Elon Did it, now he's a trillionaire)
[2024-12-27T23:44:15] GABE: The one singular token being used and no opportunity like this will ever happen again
[2024-12-27T23:45:14] Noname: Literally 99% of ebikes are weird AF
[2024-12-28T00:01:48] Matthew: I think it's for random appeal and then go along with which may actually sell. Folding smaller ebikes like the Lectric were just a pipe dream. They're based in the city I live in and you hardly ever seen a person riding a folding ebike.... it's either a Jetson or a giant fat tire ebike with a million too many accessories
[2024-12-28T00:12:09] Noname: A saw a smaller Lectric in a group ride didn't seem to bad. But I've tried bigger ones. Completely useless to pedal, seat height is odly high and the freaking tire noise is outrageous.
[2024-12-28T00:54:10] haku: failed message of the day. but you get the message.
[2024-12-28T00:54:48] haku: today lots of little jetson looking bikes in the park
[2024-12-28T00:59:06] haku: yea the big ones are heavy af. geared hubs too. like lectric and engwe. the generic folding 48v ones
[2024-12-28T01:01:34] haku: saw this one today. solid frame looks like.
[2024-12-28T01:04:25] Noname: Is that the key hanging out the side?
[2024-12-28T01:04:34] haku: yea lol
[2024-12-28T01:05:00] haku: its nice but not as portable as jetson
[2024-12-28T01:05:39] Noname: How far is the park from you?
[2024-12-28T01:11:33] haku: maybe a mile or 2
[2024-12-28T01:43:47] Noname: https://www.facebook.com/share/r/12CAZaZ8xq6/

[2024-12-28T01:54:17] haku: fuck me i thought the vsett nightmare flats are over.
[2024-12-28T01:54:52] haku: this going to be a bitch to change. no split rim with tubes
[2024-12-28T01:58:18] Noname: Easy. Get one side of bead in the valley of the rim and pry other side over. Remove one side slap in tube
[2024-12-28T01:59:09] haku: ill get a patch kit. ran out
[2024-12-28T02:00:03] GABE: I never have luck with those.
[2024-12-28T02:00:27] GABE: maybe I shoulvee considered that before tearing my last tube to pieces I a fit of rage
[2024-12-28T02:00:54] GABE: With a knife
[2024-12-28T02:01:16] GABE: This feeling is worse than finding out your gf cheated on you

[2024-12-28T02:08:55] GABE: Doesn't it turn into glass like shit no?
[2024-12-28T02:09:02] haku: patch should be enough yea
[2024-12-28T02:09:04] GABE: or am I dumb
[2024-12-28T02:12:21] Noname: Yeah but the hole will be under the patch. Super fast way to patch though

[2024-12-28T03:29:06] GABE: He's a real active user, he's on it all the time.

[2024-12-28T08:39:09] Noname: Long ago they took VW bug engines and put them in a sand buggy. This is just new EV
[2024-12-28T09:38:21] haku: it will get worked on soon
[2024-12-28T09:38:52] Yamal: FIRE‼️❗️‼️❗️‼️

[2024-12-28T10:20:15] haku: wish i can fit this on the jetson. I just found this on AliExpress: $206.97 | 12inch Electric Bike Brushless DC Hub Motor 60V 72V Quiet Operation Disc Brake Motor for Electric Scooter https://a.aliexpress.com/_mOfX58B
[2024-12-28T11:35:54] puneDir: I want to build some surron type e bike
[2024-12-28T11:36:12] puneDir: But i need some proper inrunner or hub motor first
[2024-12-28T11:36:15] puneDir: And 84200
[2024-12-28T11:36:27] puneDir: And plasma cutter
[2024-12-28T16:50:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Have 2 used them for 5-6 months good vescs no problem
[2024-12-28T17:44:23] Face de Pin Sucé: Good to know

[2024-12-28T17:48:56] Noname: Just need a jack again lol
[2024-12-28T17:51:18] Noname: @Bradhaku the jetson is a 12" tall tire?
[2024-12-28T17:57:20] puneDir: What kind of creature is this
[2024-12-28T18:07:40] Noname: No that motor
[2024-12-28T18:07:56] Noname: Idk if he realizes 12 rim vs 12 tire
[2024-12-28T18:44:27] haku: yes
[2024-12-28T18:45:09] Noname: Well that rim is 12" tall
[2024-12-28T18:48:13] haku: tell us more about the parts used
[2024-12-28T18:53:00] haku: i think 30+ mph on a jetson bolt is enough. i dont go that speed all the time anyway. i use this bike to walk dog and park rides with my boy.
[2024-12-28T18:53:20] haku: its very sketchy at 30mph
[2024-12-28T18:54:07] haku: but burnouts are weak af. sad but its okay
[2024-12-28T18:55:03] Noname: Well I think 80ft/lbs of torque might fold that frame into a pretzel
[2024-12-28T18:55:41] haku: its a steel frame. idk what steel prolly shit steel but better than alu
[2024-12-28T19:00:28] haku: 72v vesc all internal jetson bolt. like putting glitters on shit

[2024-12-28T19:34:15] haku: yea ching viet poop coffee is actually really good
[2024-12-28T19:35:23] Noname: Just saw a thing. They blend up grass straw put in bamboo seal with wax and put in outhouse poop for months. Then wash and eat
[2024-12-28T19:36:25] haku: the coffee i have was beans eaten by weasels and partialy digested. the viet harvest the poop and roast the poop beans
[2024-12-28T19:37:35] haku: it has a acquired taste
[2024-12-28T19:56:23] Noname: <animation>
[2024-12-28T19:59:38] haku: that viet poop coffee is pretty strong. im sure this is the stuff they are on when they were in the tunnels getting napalmed. good stuff
[2024-12-28T20:00:23] haku: thats prolly how they figured it out. some weasel poop in the jungle that got napalmed and roasted the beans

[2024-12-28T21:18:18] Andrei Albert: Probably yes
[2024-12-28T21:18:25] haku: votroll maybe
[2024-12-28T22:16:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: My 2024
[2024-12-28T22:33:57] haku: current and reigning worlds fastest zero champ.
[2024-12-28T22:34:05] haku: no contenders to the title
[2024-12-28T22:35:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yep but I'm selling the battery now to afford 72 for the dualtron
[2024-12-28T22:35:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The frame I'll maybe give my older bro
[2024-12-28T22:35:47] haku: is it a 72v battery. keep both my boy
[2024-12-28T22:36:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And he can get a new battery
[2024-12-28T22:36:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No the zero10x was 60v that's the thing

[2024-12-28T22:43:01] ✨🇪🇸عمر: <photos/photo_20475@28-12-2024_22-43-01.jpg>
[2024-12-28T22:43:03] ✨🇪🇸عمر: How many watts do you think this controller outputs?
[2024-12-28T22:43:08] ✨🇪🇸عمر: 15kw?
[2024-12-28T22:43:48] haku: expensive.
[2024-12-29T00:32:42] haku: what is trampa doing? i like it
[2024-12-29T00:33:24] haku: message for the boys
[2024-12-29T00:37:32] Matthew: Are those good controller to buy? I never know what to think when people mention they'll be utilizing one
[2024-12-29T00:43:56] 'lekrsu': going swol and becoming more swol, let's goo
[2024-12-29T00:46:32] Matthew: I have the 85150 units. I don't think you can go wrong with them. Not only do they handle a crazy amount of power for what they are dude I messaged recently is running 230amps phase out of a single 85150. I'm not like some of you that have 20kw at hand on the regular but 115amp battery and 150 amp per motor phase, that was very powerful and "jerky" with a thumb throttle, I understand a spin throttle takes care of the jerky inputs. I started with 60 amps phase per motor once installed and configured and kept going up. At the point I was at 120amps phase per motor i said fuck it and went to 160amp phase per motor and the front wheel came up off the ground. I was running 2 vsett 10+ motors at the time.
[2024-12-29T00:54:18] Matthew: There's lots of those around me. I want to try some stupid tall off-road tire with a big magnet 11" motor rated 3kw nominal in the rear. But I don't know what the dropout size is
[2024-12-29T01:03:52] haku: prolly same like jetson. very narrow
[2024-12-29T01:04:38] haku: jetson bolt 😭
[2024-12-29T01:08:06] haku: Noname look at this toyota tercell pickup haha
[2024-12-29T01:08:14] haku: i need one
[2024-12-29T01:10:09] Matthew: What's narrow? 125mm? Or?
[2024-12-29T01:11:20] Matthew: Looks like the car that won the limbo competition at a racing event i attended years ago... weeman(jackass) was the talk host haha
[2024-12-29T01:13:26] GABE: all spintend is good
[2024-12-29T01:13:31] GABE: except the 13s one
[2024-12-29T01:14:53] haku: yea i think so. havent measured
[2024-12-29T01:15:44] Noname: For only 9g You can have a bug truck
[2024-12-29T01:15:54] Noname: There's also a challenger one around here
[2024-12-29T01:17:13] Noname: 7500$
[2024-12-29T01:19:59] haku: when the dynos come the vescs will sell. https://youtu.be/2dPsUTrB6Ek?si=f4wQk-36bJOWUyER
[2024-12-29T01:38:21] Matthew: Far driver?
[2024-12-29T01:39:18] Matthew: <photos/photo_20480@29-12-2024_01-39-18.jpg>
[2024-12-29T01:40:37] haku: this is new. never seen this car before. owner said its made in US
[2024-12-29T01:40:40] Matthew: I like the spintend 85150 units I have been messing with. Do you guys have much input on their 85240 units? Seen caps are different and also more connections to the vesc.
[2024-12-29T01:42:19] haku: 4 door sports car seems like
[2024-12-29T01:42:31] Matthew: I'm a car guy but not up to date on modern machines
[2024-12-29T01:43:23] Jan: The company died
[2024-12-29T01:43:26] Jan: Fisker
[2024-12-29T01:44:01] haku: oh i see
[2024-12-29T01:44:13] haku: i dont even know that brand
[2024-12-29T01:44:14] Pandalgns: Guys, a question, what connector do you recommend for the 20s 10p molicel p45b battery... 450a more or less, I was thinking something a little larger than the xt90 since I am going to put 6awg cables and in an xt90 I don't think they will fit
[2024-12-29T01:44:49] Pandalgns: It would be to put two connectors, that is, double voltage output, one for each controller.
[2024-12-29T01:45:06] haku: qs8
[2024-12-29T01:45:26] Pandalgns: Is anti spark?
[2024-12-29T01:45:27] Noname: Great ✂️ though 😆
[2024-12-29T01:45:33] haku: yep
[2024-12-29T01:45:47] haku: what that mean? scisaors
[2024-12-29T01:45:54] Pandalgns: Oh perfect I'll look at it thanks brother
[2024-12-29T01:46:02] Noname: Fiskers brand scissors
[2024-12-29T01:47:49] haku: not really antispark if your using ant
[2024-12-29T01:48:25] Noname: Whats this screenshot for?
[2024-12-29T01:48:40] Noname: Bigger units more power
[2024-12-29T01:49:01] Noname: Not antispark from the backside
[2024-12-29T01:49:41] Noname: I get it though. The snap on cover has a gap and doesn't look pushed in fully
[2024-12-29T01:50:39] Noname: I was looking for an old fashioned lightbulb to test it was off. Settled for a 12v tractor light as incandescent bulbs died off
[2024-12-29T01:50:40] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Noname has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-29T01:51:08] haku: yea.
[2024-12-29T01:51:38] haku: i have logs to prove i turned it off. ant crazy
[2024-12-29T01:53:00] Noname: They snap in but that gap
[2024-12-29T01:55:08] haku: not with me unfortunately
[2024-12-29T01:55:09] haku: <photos/photo_20484@29-12-2024_01-55-09.jpg>

[2024-12-29T01:56:55] haku: i use a c clamp even then its difficult
[2024-12-29T01:56:57] Noname: @Bradhaku they regulate ebikes but not jet bikes yet. Found a loop hole
[2024-12-29T01:57:08] Noname: Wimps
[2024-12-29T01:57:23] Noname: <animation>
[2024-12-29T02:07:23] Matthew: Ok
[2024-12-29T02:07:53] Matthew: I was wondering is fardriver a good controller?
[2024-12-29T02:09:57] Noname: Have friends that use them. One thing is if multiple units they have a hard time disconnecting and connect to 2nd unit. Seems like more raw power than refined but I've never used one
[2024-12-29T02:10:15] Noname: Plus they're quite big
[2024-12-29T02:11:09] Matthew: Gotcha. Thank you. Seen someone recently in a different group talking about getting one and until him i didn't know the unit existed
[2024-12-29T02:26:58] Matthew: What got burned lol! I mean what happened? I accidentally wired something wrong recently like a month ago probably. Was an xt60 connector and when I went to plug it in there was an eventful spark that happened with some smoke too the cable and looked at male side and the electrodes become the fuse. It popped off at ~6000 free lipo amps.
[2024-12-29T02:30:36] Noname: He squeezed cover on with needle nose pliers. Somehow shorted the back with a 500a bms at 84v
[2024-12-29T02:30:59] Matthew: Dang
[2024-12-29T02:31:57] Noname: Bet that was a fun to see
[2024-12-29T02:32:45] Matthew: Yeah, made me want to 5x check my wiring before messing with that power again
[2024-12-29T02:33:54] Noname: Could always make a M/F adapter with a small replaceable fuse
[2024-12-29T02:34:36] Noname: To prevent explosions. Shit happens I think everyone has has at least a small spark here
[2024-12-29T02:38:38] Matthew: I was adding the lipo pack 2s6p 31.3ah. Instead of taking the lipo packs in had all together 6 in parallel, I plugged it in parallel Instead of series. I lucked out big time that connector blew as a fuse. It was plugged into 16s7p 31.5ah
[2024-12-29T02:38:48] Noname: I'm only buy Vesc because of the good chat group 😆
[2024-12-29T02:40:32] Matthew: Had it on there for thousands of miles. I had everything apart doing a rear compartment and different wiring with intention of getting rid of 2s pack and put another 16s7p battery in near future. I forgot to change the pigtail....
[2024-12-29T02:40:50] Noname: <animation>
[2024-12-29T02:42:11] Noname: Oof yeah luckily small connectors on that blew first. The qs8 is a bit more metal to burn through.
[2024-12-29T02:42:51] Noname: I know I rush sometimes and have 12 thoughts going in my head.
[2024-12-29T02:45:23] haku: yep what noname said but i swear i turned off bms. i have evidence
[2024-12-29T02:45:45] Matthew: Same here. Was just all ok, plug it in and close the "trunk" and call it a day POOF oh gahd. Before the closure of the circuit I'm overlooking everything again
[2024-12-29T02:46:08] Noname: We tought you well. But check with meter next time
[2024-12-29T02:47:08] Noname: I had fantom voltage. Said to myself dont haku yourself and used a lightbulb to short it
[2024-12-29T02:47:29] haku: yep lesson learned
[2024-12-29T02:47:47] haku: that was very memorable moment
[2024-12-29T02:47:49] Matthew: Haha
[2024-12-29T02:51:21] Matthew: I could have just seen my apartment complex on fire
[2024-12-29T02:52:04] Noname: I know a guy who did that
[2024-12-29T02:55:01] Matthew: Yeah, was seeing their price to their power capabilities and was just wondering what happens when you venture from spintend? I want a tronic for my yume y11+ but if a different controller could do 16s 500 phase amps and is adjustable. Or do those controllers just come as is connect a throttle and it's just raw and completely unrefined?
[2024-12-29T02:56:02] Matthew: ☠️
[2024-12-29T02:56:53] Noname: Same thing with set up and adjustability. I looked at the app before and seems OK but way different than vesc
[2024-12-29T02:57:24] Noname: 500 phase on what motor?
[2024-12-29T02:58:16] Matthew: Cool
[2024-12-29T02:59:51] Matthew: A yume y11+ ym60v3000w. I've ran 50 mph for 10 miles straight on the thing and the motor is barely above ambient temps. I have multiple to find out what they'll take for power haha
[2024-12-29T03:01:34] Matthew: I know 500 is way off from 50 but I honestly want to just find out for science lol
[2024-12-29T03:01:59] Noname: Careful idk if a wheel would lock up at those amps if it burns
[2024-12-29T03:02:19] Matthew: <photos/photo_20485@29-12-2024_03-02-19.jpg>
[2024-12-29T03:02:20] Matthew: <photos/photo_20486@29-12-2024_03-02-20.jpg>
[2024-12-29T03:02:24] Matthew: See, science
[2024-12-29T03:04:24] Matthew: Good to know for sure. I was not intending on balls to the wall kill myself. With my dual motor vsett I started at 60a per motor... then slowly up to 150a per motor.
[2024-12-29T03:04:52] Matthew: I am paranoid about the heat
[2024-12-29T03:05:45] Matthew: And most definitely going to fill that motor with statorade. Night and day difference using it
[2024-12-29T03:05:46] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Matthew has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-29T03:06:43] Noname: 10+?
[2024-12-29T03:07:07] Finn: Most of the time the plastic will deform so the cap cant fit anymore
[2024-12-29T03:25:09] haku: riding in the sidewalk and bike lanes and not going on streets going full blast is actually pretty relaxing. no cars to worry about. on the wepoor going on highways and 45mph streets needs alot of focus
[2024-12-29T03:26:03] haku: just doing 15-20mph isnt bad at all. just slow but you can listen to your headphones and not worry about cars
[2024-12-29T03:28:09] haku: i even rode the jetson inside a pharmacy. they dont care at all.
[2024-12-29T03:30:06] haku: i have to say im impressed with the range on a 20s3p 35e just going slow.
[2024-12-29T03:39:56] Noname: Yes that is fantastic range home to pharmacy wow
[2024-12-29T03:42:05] Noname: No headphones for me, safety hazard, I only listen to the sound of wind.
[2024-12-29T03:49:45] haku: in the sidewalk no cars
[2024-12-29T03:49:55] haku: just pedestrians 😜
[2024-12-29T03:51:43] Noname: Doesn't matter still won't wear em. Buddy's have intercoms and want me to get I'm like he'll no. Use your blinker and I'll follow just fine
[2024-12-29T03:53:56] haku: have you ridden in a sidewalk. theres no one there
[2024-12-29T03:54:27] Noname: Yeah still cars next to ya
[2024-12-29T03:55:31] Noname: Idk just never listened to music while riding. It's always the asshat that you have to give special instructions to in a group ride.
[2024-12-29T03:55:48] Noname: Oh what I had my music on
[2024-12-29T03:55:55] haku: i listen to podcasts
[2024-12-29T03:56:09] Noname: Weird
[2024-12-29T03:56:17] haku: or ebike videos
[2024-12-29T03:56:25] Noname: Weirder
[2024-12-29T03:56:31] haku: just random stuff
[2024-12-29T03:56:33] haku: lol

[2024-12-29T03:58:35] haku: they have all the tools.
[2024-12-29T03:59:29] haku: the chaoyang ev video is what makes me want to get one lol
[2024-12-29T04:41:57] haku: look at this thumb throttle. it has the power switch and light switch. I just found this on AliExpress: $3.77 | Electric Scooter Throttle Accelerator Replacement Parts 51005-5P E-Scooter Integrated Switch for X6/X7/X8 https://a.aliexpress.com/_mK1gA7h
[2024-12-29T05:03:46] haku: i like the simple design.
[2024-12-29T05:04:50] haku: do you know if its a latching button
[2024-12-29T05:38:06] haku: the lights need latching yea?
[2024-12-29T05:48:28] Noname: @jamessoderstrom thought you couldn't use illuminated in use buttons?
[2024-12-29T05:49:41] Noname: Forget exactly why but I had to use blank switches. Mabey I was getting voltage bleed?
[2024-12-29T11:28:38] Andrei Albert: Almost doneeee
[2024-12-29T12:16:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Sick dualtron bro can't wait to be done with mine

[2024-12-29T12:18:12] Rose: Hey there User, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-12-29T12:23:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Does bro have a problem I'm enjoying my life ?
[2024-12-29T12:25:57] Maximus Brokus: No
[2024-12-29T12:26:03] Maximus Brokus: Just ranting on dualtron
[2024-12-29T12:43:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like zero or kukirin is better
[2024-12-29T12:44:24] Maximus Brokus: Never said anything like that
[2024-12-29T12:44:32] Maximus Brokus: Post a kugoo and I rant that too

[2024-12-29T13:47:05] GABE: more connections? wdym lol
[2024-12-29T13:58:06] Maximus Brokus: Id just wish I knew the answer, im so desperate that imo still the only good option is ninebot g30
[2024-12-29T14:05:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Just compromise everything has problems
[2024-12-29T14:05:55] Maximus Brokus: Yeah, but frame stability is a point I wont make any compromise
[2024-12-29T14:07:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I think the thunder is one of the most strong dual suspension unmodified scooter
[2024-12-29T14:07:26] Maximus Brokus: Still the neck is pretty delicate
[2024-12-29T14:08:07] Maximus Brokus: Id wish there would be mroe scooter with a sturdy neck like this
[2024-12-29T14:16:48] Andrei Albert: When abused riding incorrectly
[2024-12-29T14:27:22] Maximus Brokus: Yeah, dualtron should know that their products get abused a lot
[2024-12-29T14:27:30] Maximus Brokus: Thats why G30 is so good
[2024-12-29T14:27:46] Maximus Brokus: First tough rental scooter, designed to withstand abuse
[2024-12-29T14:56:02] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Hugo scooters
[2024-12-29T14:56:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What is abused so I'll know not to do it ?

[2024-12-29T21:19:25] Noname: Matthew Hillbilly express? Where you going
[2024-12-29T21:34:17] Matthew: A yume y11+ scooter. I have extra motors.
[2024-12-29T21:36:43] Matthew: Yeah, so I either want 16s or 32s. 16s if I match what I have now will give me 63ah with 180amp bms. 32s I'd want to go with 90 amps battery. Or possibly a 72v 40ah with 300 amp battery.
[2024-12-29T21:38:57] Matthew: Has more 12v output connections. And the site says the vesc is slightly smaller than the 85250.
[2024-12-29T21:39:38] Matthew: <photos/photo_20493@29-12-2024_21-39-38.jpg>

[2024-12-29T23:05:56] Yamal: Thank you, there is nothing exceptional on the channel yet, it is something that is just starting, I try to share some outings that I do with the e-scooter and little else, between work/winter etc. complicated, well something will happen,,
[2024-12-29T23:07:11] haku: sit down when we ride lifestyle. i like it
[2024-12-29T23:08:00] Andrei Albert: A little bit than thunder 1

[2024-12-29T23:15:27] haku: thats what you call paractical my boy. sit down when we ride lifestyle
[2024-12-29T23:16:44] haku: just in time for new year speed test
[2024-12-29T23:23:15] Yamal: Tomorrow time for ride , last route 2024,,,, 31. Busy

[2024-12-29T23:23:41] Pandalgns: The cuts weren't very straight or perfect, but what do you think?
[2024-12-29T23:24:34] Pandalgns: I need a little paint to hide the cuts and seal it a little with silicone so that it is sealed
[2024-12-29T23:26:40] Pandalgns: And the other one here
[2024-12-29T23:29:40] Noname: This is the deck?
[2024-12-29T23:30:03] Noname: Wondering if he's going camping with all that luggage
[2024-12-29T23:30:49] Pandalgns: Yes, it's where I put my feet, the base
[2024-12-29T23:32:23] Pandalgns: I don't know whether to seal the gaps in the imprecise cuts with silicone, sicaflex or epoxy resin or something like that.
[2024-12-29T23:32:25] Noname: The controller has radiator built in or removable?
[2024-12-29T23:32:34] Pandalgns: Built in

[2024-12-29T23:33:35] Yamal: In the deck ?
[2024-12-29T23:33:42] Yamal: No place … sad
[2024-12-29T23:33:46] Noname: Flat bolted on would be better. You have a tripping point now
[2024-12-29T23:35:00] Noname: But radiator wouldn't work against flat metal
[2024-12-29T23:35:03] Pandalgns: If I put it at the same height I'm afraid that the heatsink won't cool well as it goes flat on the base, that's why I left it sticking out a few millimeters, anyway I positioned them where I don't put my feet, the right one in front and the left one behind
[2024-12-29T23:35:52] Noname: Well add rubber mat to deck and keep flush not so bad then
[2024-12-29T23:36:44] Noname: Backwards foot placement guy
[2024-12-29T23:37:32] Pandalgns: Why?? 😂😂
[2024-12-29T23:38:15] Pandalgns: I am right-handed, my right foot is the one in charge
[2024-12-29T23:41:05] Noname: You R foot forward?
[2024-12-29T23:58:03] Smart Repair: Is there anyone here who can write a Lisp script that reduces the battery amps by half?! Assuming the battery is set to 200A in the settings, then the controller should only allow a maximum of 100A.
[2024-12-29T23:59:31] Pandalgns: No
[2024-12-29T23:59:48] Pandalgns: My left foot forward
[2024-12-29T23:59:56] 'lekrsu': Set 100A instead then, or what's the issue with that?
[2024-12-30T00:00:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The 2 is the same ?
[2024-12-30T00:02:05] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_20501@30-12-2024_00-02-05.jpg>
[2024-12-30T00:02:29] Smart Repair: doesn't work.. I have a dual setup consisting of a 150 and 250 ubox. The battery amps are automatically written to the controller via UART. It is currently not possible to write 2 different values. Therefore I have to reduce the current on the 150 ubox by half

[2024-12-30T00:55:43] Pandalgns: What??😂😂
[2024-12-30T00:56:14] Pandalgns: Let's see, I'll show you another way

[2024-12-30T01:09:42] Pandalgns: I ride with my R foot on the front of deck

[2024-12-30T01:09:44] Noname: Sorry your confused 😆
[2024-12-30T01:10:47] Noname: Yeah that backwards from the norm. Like snowboarding right handed people go L foot first
[2024-12-30T01:12:22] Pandalgns: Oh damn I'm sorry brother you were right I was misunderstanding you 😂😂😂
[2024-12-30T01:12:37] Pandalgns: My bad
[2024-12-30T01:14:32] Pandalgns: 🤣🤣 that's why I'm not good at snowboarding, I go with my right foot in front
[2024-12-30T01:15:16] Noname: Idk if it matters your prob just not good at snowboarding lol
[2024-12-30T01:15:24] Noname: Kidding
[2024-12-30T01:15:47] Noname: I can't ride R first for more than a few miles. I can't carve a turn
[2024-12-30T01:16:04] Pandalgns: I like snowboarding but yes, I'm really bad 😂😂
[2024-12-30T01:16:32] Noname: How's your scootering 😆
[2024-12-30T01:17:15] Noname: Weird I wish I could go backwards my big toe bends and it hurts. Smashed it at work years ago
[2024-12-30T01:17:15] 'lekrsu': You confused me, now I don't even remember which way I usually stand
[2024-12-30T01:17:25] Pandalgns: When I finish the scooter I'll show you a video, you'll see that it's not as bad as snowboarding 😂
[2024-12-30T01:18:15] Noname: Blame Pandalgns for that.
[2024-12-30T01:18:30] Noname: It's subconscious don't think or you'll trip
[2024-12-30T01:19:05] 'lekrsu': Like remembering binds in games
[2024-12-30T01:19:21] Pandalgns: Sorry brother, you should give me a whip for that
[2024-12-30T01:20:45] Pandalgns: I didn't mean to confuse you, my fault, that's what it's like to be Spanish and use a translator, sometimes you get confused with the terms 😂😂
[2024-12-30T01:21:11] Noname: Ah Spanish, thought you were dumb lol
[2024-12-30T01:21:50] Pandalgns: 😐😐 I don't know whether to laugh or insult you 😂😂
[2024-12-30T01:22:03] Noname: I'm laughing so join
[2024-12-30T01:22:14] Noname: With you not at you
[2024-12-30T01:22:17] 'lekrsu': Go ahead, insult each other, 🍿
[2024-12-30T01:22:22] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2024-12-30T01:22:38] Noname: Na we having fun
[2024-12-30T01:22:53] Pandalgns: What you want is to see a little war
[2024-12-30T01:22:57] Pandalgns: 😂😂
[2024-12-30T01:23:11] Noname: 🔫
[2024-12-30T01:23:28] Pandalgns: <sticker>
[2024-12-30T01:24:12] Pandalgns: Typical Spanish village character😂😂
[2024-12-30T01:25:19] Pandalgns: Guys, I had fun and I laughed a lot but now I should sleep or tomorrow whoever I tell you is going to work hahahaha good night gentlemen
[2024-12-30T01:26:22] haku: surrons needed for 2025. peak g30 and 72vjetson aint cutting it.
[2024-12-30T01:28:21] Noname: Nothing stops the Emoped. OK except mabey this tree but we got past
[2024-12-30T01:29:58] Noname: Also this tree but a few scratches later we were moving
[2024-12-30T01:29:59] Noname: <photos/photo_20507@30-12-2024_01-29-59.jpg>
[2024-12-30T01:30:31] haku: you want a midrive for offroad. according to experts
[2024-12-30T01:30:41] Noname: Need a knobby
[2024-12-30T01:31:33] Noname: They didn't start as off road adventures but if google maps says it a road or path I'm going through
[2024-12-30T01:32:35] haku: lots of legit desert dirt trails here
[2024-12-30T01:32:57] Noname: Wish I took pics of the bad stuff but to winded from dragging 250# though rocks and bushes
[2024-12-30T01:35:21] haku: me and my son making a mew gang called dirt lords.
[2024-12-30T01:36:37] haku: whats the weight on the niu
[2024-12-30T01:41:43] Noname: 218lbs before adding 288 more batterys. Sorry EU I don't know Kg or metric weight
[2024-12-30T01:47:32] haku: dam. thats a heavy boy
[2024-12-30T01:48:02] haku: you need a portable that you can curl buddy
[2024-12-30T01:48:11] Noname: Heavier when stuck on a tree
[2024-12-30T01:48:33] Noname: Need to mount my winch on it
[2024-12-30T01:48:48] Noname: Why you think I'm weak?
[2024-12-30T01:49:17] haku: lets see you curl that niu lol
[2024-12-30T01:49:51] haku: jetson maybe 40lbs-45
[2024-12-30T01:50:17] Noname: I just dead lifted it without batterys
[2024-12-30T01:50:44] haku: the wepoor isnactually heavy. might be 150-200
[2024-12-30T01:52:31] Noname: 218 stock battery is 20lbs I calculated. So deadlift 200# also an awkward shape off the floor
[2024-12-30T01:53:26] haku: the jetson is as fast as vsett 9 but lighter
[2024-12-30T02:24:13] GABE: It seems the mosfets didnt blow on my 801D but this smaller sub mosfet. there seems to be 4 of them. the first blew, the wire from that one goes straight into the small circuit where the pedal and DC input. It could perhaps be a resistor that went off during the power surge with gates open. Perhaps a measure in place to prevent the mosfets from dying?
[2024-12-30T02:24:23] GABE: its labelled GEE, atleast i assume so because the other 3 beside it all look identical and that one is burned.
[2024-12-30T02:24:36] GABE: its probably not a mosfet but a capacitor or something.
[2024-12-30T02:27:07] GABE: Ill take a picture with my brothers phone tomorrow, my phone broke. Could be very hard to source/identify, and the seller doesnt seem to give a fuck at all. no matter how many msgs i send. Oh dear this may be the wrong channel, apologies.
[2024-12-30T03:10:42] haku: is 240 better than the 250? 250 is tested and true
[2024-12-30T03:12:18] haku: take a photo of your gey mosfets
[2024-12-30T05:15:12] Matthew: Everywhere lol. I have what feels like unlimited battery space and some cargo space. The black box also has a battery in it and charging ports. I am wanting to get enough capacity to go on a trip to the mountains to go camping and be able to charge with solar and whatever else I suppose. I'm on prototype #300 lol. I just keep changing stuff. Change one thing and don't like it then change it back or into a completely new something.
[2024-12-30T05:17:19] Noname: Yeah I want to do a camping trip. What's your range now?
[2024-12-30T05:20:24] Matthew: 18s 31.5ah and 14s 20ah get me about 100 miles not accelerating hard very often. We have good trails and some smaller hill til you want to get out of Phoenix valley. I want to make a trip to Sedona. I think my skinny ass can make that trip and be still enjoying myself
[2024-12-30T05:21:04] Matthew: I want to yank the 60v from my yume but I'd probably regret it since it is still under warranty
[2024-12-30T05:21:53] Matthew: That would let me switch around 16s14p and I will still have the 14s battery for backup.
[2024-12-30T05:57:59] Matthew: That's mainly what I wanted to hear. Something new isn't always better. I have the 150 and I still don't have all the power outlets used yet. Need to still use 1 for brake light/taillight and i need a relay for a turn signal to work with the switches I got
[2024-12-30T06:02:58] Matthew: If you only want 100 amps battery used then just enter 50 amps for battery. Otherwise enter 100 amps battery and each controller will pull up to 100 amps battery.
[2024-12-30T06:02:59] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Matthew has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-30T06:04:46] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: <animation>
[2024-12-30T06:08:10] Smart Repair: I write 150A to both ESCs via UART. Therefore I have to somehow limit the current from the small 150 ubox to 75A. Unfortunately I have no other option. I need 150A for the 250 ubox and 75A for the 150 ubox.
[2024-12-30T06:16:38] Matthew: I see what you're saying. The 85150 takes 150amps battery without issue if that's what you're worried about. Unless there's someone who shows you differently, which I'd like to know as well 😉
[2024-12-30T06:18:14] Smart Repair: Can't I just use the Q axis current limitation for this? At 50% it should reduce the power consumption by half. Or am I wrong?
[2024-12-30T06:18:59] Smart Repair: you are right, but then I have to limit the phase current, which in turn leads to an Abs overcurrent error
[2024-12-30T06:20:40] Matthew: I see. I'm thankful you're letting me know this stuff. I'm pretty new to a lot
[2024-12-30T06:22:32] Matthew: I wish I remembered which video I had watched a while back where dude had different settings front and rear. I'd get back in touch with them
[2024-12-30T06:23:24] Smart Repair: The 85150 should not run at maximum, but rather at half power in parallel to the main ESC. I will test it later to see if it works if I limit the q-axis current to 50%.
[2024-12-30T06:24:29] Matthew: I personally messaged spintend over the 150 battery amps current. They told me yes, warranty is 150 amps battery and 150 amps phase.
[2024-12-30T06:24:55] Smart Repair: Normally it is not a problem to use different settings. The only problem I have is that every time I change modes a new value is written to the ESC via UART. This overwrites the settings stored in the ESC and makes them useless.
[2024-12-30T06:25:04] Matthew: Another guy I'm communicating with is running 230 phase amps and 150 battery
[2024-12-30T06:25:22] Matthew: Oh
[2024-12-30T06:26:56] Smart Repair: I personally think that's too much. With 80A battery and 160A phase, the Mosfet temperature rises very quickly. Continuous operation is not possible with these values
[2024-12-30T06:29:30] Matthew: <photos/photo_20509@30-12-2024_06-29-30.jpg>
[2024-12-30T06:30:33] Matthew: That's what they are running. When you get to your top speed fast enough your amps drop off fast I top out 54mph at ~60 phase amps
[2024-12-30T06:31:15] Matthew: Dual motor 50mph was maybe 35 phase amps per motor
[2024-12-30T06:34:03] Matthew: Excuse that comment... ~65-70 phase amps per motor
[2024-12-30T06:39:21] Matthew: I'm currently single motor 65h 22x3 with the 85150 ubox 90 battery amps and 150 phase amps
[2024-12-30T06:39:21] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Matthew has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-30T06:44:54] Smart Repair: I'm running 70H at the back, 250 ubox with 150A battery and 280A phase. At the front I have the 150 ubox, which should run safely alongside. I don't want to run it at maximum, so 150A battery is definitely too much for the 150.
[2024-12-30T06:47:10] Smart Repair: I doubt that a 3p 40p configuration delivers 140A battery 😉 These are desired values and at most a few seconds peak values
[2024-12-30T07:27:06] Matthew: 😳🤯
[2024-12-30T07:27:46] Matthew: Yeah, that's mainly why I'm asking stuff. Don't take me wrong. Not being sarcastic. I am new to this stuff
[2024-12-30T07:33:23] Noname: Damn 100mi on a ninebot

[2024-12-30T13:43:25] Yamal: All okay,,?
[2024-12-30T14:09:30] Andrei Albert: Almost
[2024-12-30T14:09:43] Andrei Albert: It needs more fine tuning
[2024-12-30T14:11:48] Andrei Albert: <photos/photo_20511@30-12-2024_14-11-48.jpg>
[2024-12-30T14:15:19] Yamal: Phase filter?
[2024-12-30T14:15:49] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Any lisp script wizzards here? Trying to make a lisp script that multiply a current when a current has been set. (This is due the VESC bridge for the GT's we have that sends 1 current to all controllers but when using dual motor setup and heavier controller / motor we want to have higher current on that one. Unfortunate no memory in Bridge STM available to handle that so idea is to use a lisp script. This should do the trick but seems not to work :( (defun main () "Main function to read, modify, and set current with controlled looping when changed." ;; Define a multiplier value (let ((multiplier 1.5)) ; Replace with your desired multiplier (loop ;; Read current value (let* ((current (get-current)) (new-current (* current multiplier))) ; Multiply current value ;; Prevent setting the same value to avoid unnecessary loops (if (not (= current new-current)) (progn ;; Log the values for debugging (print (str-format "Current value: ~a" current)) (print (str-format "New current value: ~a" new-current)) ;; Set the new current value (set-current new-current)) ;; Exit the loop if values are the same (progn (print "No update needed; current value unchanged.") (return)))))))
[2024-12-30T14:15:51] Yamal: what a great scooter

[2024-12-30T14:21:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Never heard of such fault
[2024-12-30T14:50:03] Andrei Albert: Yes, i works but it cuts full throttle
[2024-12-30T15:01:47] Yamal: Cuts why
[2024-12-30T15:02:34] Yamal: What type observer you have , any way the teacher from here will help you
[2024-12-30T15:08:34] NetworkDir: Oretga original
[2024-12-30T15:14:08] Yamal: So what it’s the problem

[2024-12-30T18:09:47] GABE: Omg i forgot i have MP2s i can do 24s with the g30.. HELL, OR EVEN MORE
[2024-12-30T18:09:57] GABE: forgot the reason why i bought em
[2024-12-30T18:10:22] GABE: im gonna buy some shit chinese tyres for it for cheap and daniel is sending me free hydraulic brakes What a G, hes gonna let me get my g30 done even tho im broke.
[2024-12-30T18:10:45] GABE: with the shit tyres and monorim im looking at only 200 euro to get it running lmfao I get paid in exactly 2 weeks ;)))) Fixing the welder is now NO 1 PRIORITY NO 2 is Solder up the MP2s NO 3: replace the resistors on the BMS (easy)
[2024-12-30T18:10:45] Rose: Hey there Bgufy, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-12-30T18:15:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not sure if this is possible Also far as i know there is a dedicated lisp's for awd , If you want to use different power on your motors, that is possible

[2024-12-30T18:22:06] Marius: i actually thought of getting one
[2024-12-30T18:22:13] Marius: was before i knew about tuning
[2024-12-30T18:26:06] NetworkDir: Its phase filter error probably crap hardware so i think solution is turning phase filter off
[2024-12-30T18:45:46] GABE: its good i got mt200 coming soon.
[2024-12-30T18:45:54] GABE: just gotta bleed em
[2024-12-30T18:46:06] GABE: In the future very much so could change
[2024-12-30T18:47:37] haku: gj do some real projects and get swole over here boy
[2024-12-30T18:48:30] GABE: if i do a project thats a win bro
[2024-12-30T18:50:06] haku: you took that?
[2024-12-30T18:56:24] Finn: Yea but its too dark
[2024-12-30T18:56:35] Finn: Austria rn
[2024-12-30T18:59:25] haku: thats perfect actually
[2024-12-30T19:00:12] Finn: Its too dark for the lense. It makes better photos when theres more light

[2024-12-30T19:22:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Why do we have to disasmble every new toy we get ?
[2024-12-30T19:25:20] Andrei Albert: Good question
[2024-12-30T19:25:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_20516@30-12-2024_19-25-32.jpg>
[2024-12-30T19:25:48] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: For no reason at all 😉
[2024-12-30T19:50:50] NetworkDir: Vesc tool have a option can write for both controllers but motor setup resistances i think replace also
[2024-12-30T19:51:28] NetworkDir: Let me check documentation
[2024-12-30T19:56:46] NetworkDir: You can send packet over CANBUS with another id. and write a lisp for master vesc send a current value over can and slave vesc check can message if current value changes apply to controller :) i think you can't find easier way
[2024-12-30T19:58:36] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Bridge already sends them to both thats the main issue ... and both have same value ...
[2024-12-30T19:59:33] NetworkDir: Oh so you want for example rear motor use 1.5x of the front current amps
[2024-12-30T19:59:34] NetworkDir: Hmm..
[2024-12-30T20:02:11] NetworkDir: As far as I understand, because it doesn't have memory stm, you can't receive it instantaneously and use it in the loop. If you send with canbus in real time with lisp and you can apply 1.5x in vesc slave I hope I understood correctly
[2024-12-30T20:18:15] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Memory issue is in the STM of the VESC bridge .. anyway we are looking into different way to get it into the bridge so we can avoid lisp.

[2024-12-30T22:29:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What to use ? (Also need to keep hole same size )
[2024-12-30T22:29:34] Andrei Albert: Idk honestly
[2024-12-30T22:29:39] Andrei Albert: Dremmel
[2024-12-30T22:30:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Don't have one honestly
[2024-12-30T22:30:08] haku: my boy getting swole and doing projects here too
[2024-12-30T22:30:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also afraid that I'll ruin the swing arm totally
[2024-12-30T22:30:38] haku: file it slowly
[2024-12-30T22:30:50] Andrei Albert: Yea it will be damage the color
[2024-12-30T22:31:03] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: An Idea but need 14m sized file
[2024-12-30T22:31:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Not the color if I mess up and make the hole wider ?
[2024-12-30T22:31:41] haku: hand filing and not rushing it. dremmel has cut me too many times. not my fault dremmel woke
[2024-12-30T22:31:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Don't really care for small damage
[2024-12-30T22:32:20] Rose: Hey there Glotzkowski, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-12-30T22:41:35] Andrei Albert: Well then do it

[2024-12-30T22:48:41] Matte: circular file
[2024-12-30T22:54:51] Andrei Albert: Anyone has a adjustable charger for sale in eu?
[2024-12-30T22:54:59] Andrei Albert: Mines died
[2024-12-30T22:55:06] Andrei Albert: 😩
[2024-12-30T22:56:17] Yamal: 🤌
[2024-12-30T22:57:12] haku: mucho dinero adjustable chargers
[2024-12-30T22:59:17] Yamal: Mucho money
[2024-12-30T22:59:23] Andrei Albert: Yea but 100.8 V nothing cheap
[2024-12-30T22:59:43] Yamal: Around 100€
[2024-12-30T22:59:43] Andrei Albert: And i dont see any options
[2024-12-30T22:59:55] Yamal: 20A
[2024-12-30T23:01:28] Matte: Why does it need to be adjustable?
[2024-12-30T23:07:25] Andrei Albert: To use it for 20s and 24a
[2024-12-30T23:07:29] Andrei Albert: 24s*
[2024-12-30T23:14:54] Matte: ohh when you mentioned here only a single voltage i thought you were looking for current adjusting one
[2024-12-30T23:21:56] Rose: Hey there Bgufy, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2024-12-30T23:25:54] Yamal: He encontrado esto en AliExpress: 239,38€ | 20A voltaje Curren ajustar 24v 48v 67,2 V 72V Li-ion LiPo Lifepo4 cargador de batería de litio 8S 13S 14S 16S 20S 24S piezas de carga rápida https://a.aliexpress.com/_EGdxmbW
[2024-12-30T23:26:12] Yamal: Need be like 100/120€
[2024-12-30T23:26:30] Yamal: I don’t know why they put 239..
[2024-12-30T23:27:55] Andrei Albert: I just found this on AliExpress: RON507.76 | Adjustable Voltage Current 0-100V 20A 25A 30A Lithium Battery Charger LiFePO4 Battery Charging Charger for Delta https://a.aliexpress.com/_Ew3gaU0
[2024-12-30T23:28:04] Andrei Albert: This one i had, it exploded inside
[2024-12-30T23:28:42] Andrei Albert: Both voltage and amperage i need
[2024-12-30T23:29:11] Matte: https://www.amazon.de/WANPTEK-POWER-Type-c-Schnellladeanschluss-120V-360W/dp/B0CPLVCHYH
[2024-12-30T23:29:13] Matte: maybe
[2024-12-30T23:29:24] Andrei Albert: Only 3A
[2024-12-30T23:29:42] Andrei Albert: Good for home but not fast
[2024-12-30T23:30:08] Matte: its true but how often do you need it done faster
[2024-12-30T23:30:14] Andrei Albert: At least 10-15 A i want
[2024-12-30T23:30:23] Andrei Albert: Yea but its not portable
[2024-12-30T23:30:37] Andrei Albert: Most times i charge at 8-10 amps
[2024-12-30T23:31:11] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Wait are running 100v
[2024-12-30T23:32:08] Yamal: I charge 2,8A normally, 5-7A no time… 20A long travel ..
[2024-12-30T23:32:19] Andrei Albert: Full Yeah
[2024-12-30T23:32:22] Noname: Junk my friend bought one
[2024-12-30T23:32:49] Andrei Albert: It is good but not more than 84V max
[2024-12-30T23:33:02] Yamal: It’s really 20A , can see in BMS
[2024-12-30T23:33:08] Andrei Albert: I had mine for 8 months worked no problem at 72v sistem
[2024-12-30T23:33:24] Andrei Albert: Voltage its the problem
[2024-12-30T23:33:36] Noname: Mabey similar one then. It had that handle
[2024-12-30T23:34:49] Andrei Albert: The huawei r power source its good
[2024-12-30T23:34:57] Andrei Albert: But its a bit expensive
[2024-12-30T23:35:48] Noname: Yes I have one
[2024-12-30T23:35:49] Noname: It's a tank
[2024-12-30T23:37:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Wwoow bro
[2024-12-31T00:06:38] Noname: Yeah there ok just don't drop them. That's the old style now.
[2024-12-31T00:07:35] Noname: "Roger" is from Cali he had these made and then they kinda stole his name to sell them.
[2024-12-31T00:10:02] Noname: These modded power supply's work great. We have moved on to cnc cases and Bluetooth but that's just extra cost
[2024-12-31T00:12:04] Noname: <animation>
[2024-12-31T00:12:14] Noname: You missed on this one
[2024-12-31T00:12:14] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Noname has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-31T00:19:07] haku: as promised white cyber truck to match peak g30
[2024-12-31T01:25:39] Smart Repair: Does anyone know how many poles the 11" 70H lonnyo motor has?
[2024-12-31T02:33:04] haku: i will not do it. i think getting this will be the last straw to get me ban here.
[2024-12-31T04:11:42] Smart Repair: Dual Setup 250 + 150 ubox What could be the cause of the dropouts? The log file has the same dropouts. The motor runs normally. Could it be because the CAN cable is close to the phase cable?
[2024-12-31T04:11:42] Smart Repair: <video_file>
[2024-12-31T05:19:35] haku: everytime i ride the jetson. this is how i think i look like. https://youtube.com/shorts/joqBAbv07qI?si=V5HIwffSLWv8ngie
[2024-12-31T05:44:24] Yamal: 31!!!!!!!
[2024-12-31T05:45:39] Noname: Should be cooler this year. About the same weight but more surface area. The thermal pad I used only squished to 1.5mm on the R piece. L is paste
[2024-12-31T08:45:52] haku: 30
[2024-12-31T08:46:22] haku: where you buy thermal pads
[2024-12-31T08:46:39] Noname: Amazon
[2024-12-31T08:46:52] haku: link papi
[2024-12-31T08:47:15] Noname: Why paste better
[2024-12-31T08:47:51] haku: paste expensive. if fancy brand
[2024-12-31T08:48:43] haku: prolly need 2 noctua syringe for 85/250
[2024-12-31T08:50:35] Noname: Iceberg Thermal DRIFTIce Thermal Pad 120mm x 40mm (2.0mm) (13 W/mK) https://a.co/d/88IfSaF
[2024-12-31T08:51:33] Noname: I did 2 with 10g. Got 4g this time oops. Be a bit thin lol
[2024-12-31T09:57:34] yoann tsobanoglou: Anyone know what happened to bronco motors? Tried to make payment of some parts and the account details where of a partner that is closed now. Asked them and the person handling the chat seems lost. Fast ride and all other partners seem to have dropped their scooters off their catalog. Has someone ordered on their site lately?
[2024-12-31T10:00:47] Smart Repair: Thx
[2024-12-31T10:03:28] yoann tsobanoglou: Are your vesc setup independently?
[2024-12-31T10:14:59] Smart Repair: no, simultaneously via can
[2024-12-31T10:21:09] Yamal: ….
[2024-12-31T10:21:24] Yamal: Oficial web bronco can’t ?
[2024-12-31T10:24:30] rosheee: <voice_message>
[2024-12-31T10:42:27] Matte: Gd900 is 4 euros for 30 grams on AliExpress
[2024-12-31T10:47:53] Matte: Thermal double sided sticky tape would also work better than a thermal pad
[2024-12-31T10:48:07] Matte: Because it is only .2mm thick
[2024-12-31T11:01:39] yoann tsobanoglou: I don’t trust. They use a partner for wiring transaction that has struck off since September 2024
[2024-12-31T11:01:58] yoann tsobanoglou: And every partner they had has removed their product of their site
[2024-12-31T11:04:19] Yamal: Why bronco you want
[2024-12-31T11:07:04] yoann tsobanoglou: Can you tell me how you proceed to change modes ?
[2024-12-31T11:07:17] yoann tsobanoglou: You use spintend green board ?
[2024-12-31T11:08:16] yoann tsobanoglou: Why don’t you use profiles ?
[2024-12-31T11:09:02] yoann tsobanoglou: Profiles handle power attribute which is set in percentage and won’t affect stored values in phase and battery amps
[2024-12-31T11:09:42] yoann tsobanoglou: I want extreme 11 frames for projects
[2024-12-31T11:09:43] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. yoann has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-31T11:10:09] Yamal: Rose Rose
[2024-12-31T11:10:22] Yamal: Extreme 11 ?
[2024-12-31T11:10:41] Yamal: 11” motors or what you mean
[2024-12-31T11:12:42] yoann tsobanoglou: It’s a scooter frame
[2024-12-31T11:13:03] Yamal: Ah sorry
[2024-12-31T11:13:04] Yamal: Yes
[2024-12-31T11:13:12] Yamal: Bronco extreme 11
[2024-12-31T11:14:11] Yamal: I don't think it was very successful in the end.
[2024-12-31T11:14:35] Yamal: very similar to the dt thunder, As always, there is no space for a powerful battery and controllers inside...RFP solution, in lebocoin France there is some chassis,,
[2024-12-31T11:14:35] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2024-12-31T11:18:03] 'lekrsu': It's a percentage reduction of those values
[2024-12-31T11:21:45] 'lekrsu': The percentage value is stored elsewhere, not shown via batt & phase input fields.
[2024-12-31T11:22:54] yoann tsobanoglou: Yes, wouldn’t that solve his problem ?
[2024-12-31T12:17:34] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Enough space imo

[2024-12-31T12:49:30] Matte: Some of these scooters heavier than a motorcycle

[2025-01-01T01:04:04] Matthew: Can you change ramp time a bit? I changed my ramp time to .3 second from .1 and it's not as twitchy on me
[2025-01-01T01:07:21] ✨🇪🇸عمر: I wish you a wonderful year! and may your scooter be even more powerful this year!
[2025-01-01T01:12:06] Smart Repair: The throttle comes via UART. To me it looks like a problem in the CAN bus... but I'm not sure. I'll completely reinstall the system tomorrow and take a look.
[2025-01-01T01:13:16] GABE: Entire Fiido L3 (1000e ebike) seating mechanism broke after i was tightening it to stop the seat from wiggling front and back like a seesaw Snapped like an explosion
[2025-01-01T01:13:25] GABE: Perhaps the most worst ebike to ever be made
[2025-01-01T01:13:42] GABE: Absolute chinese jank with ape engineering Along with the dropouts being eaten alive because they are designed wrong. This shit can kill you.
[2025-01-01T01:14:06] GABE: tried to switch it out with another bike seat but they just had to make the pipe their own diameter. Phases got eaten by brakes too stock, esc not even secured, awful geometry
[2025-01-01T01:42:31] haku: show photo
[2025-01-01T01:42:58] haku: unfortunate you aint rockin a jetson bolt baby.
[2025-01-01T01:45:45] GABE: My phone broke, but its a 10mm bolt that snapped clean
[2025-01-01T01:46:04] GABE: its so stupid
[2025-01-01T01:48:33] haku: jeebus no phone? how you even buy weed. dude
[2025-01-01T02:04:05] GABE: Moms phone
[2025-01-01T02:04:20] GABE: Just gotta buy a new screen, its 25e cheap but like ali shipping takes 4w
[2025-01-01T02:09:49] haku: is it the seat clamp that broke?
[2025-01-01T02:10:21] haku: i need to help my sitdown when we ride bros
[2025-01-01T02:28:47] GABE: its gone
[2025-01-01T02:29:10] haku: you can get new seat clamps. its universal
[2025-01-01T02:29:31] haku: take one from a different bike you have
[2025-01-01T02:29:33] GABE: Im just gonna work on the m365 cos i hate that jank
[2025-01-01T02:30:11] haku: alright. i will cancel your 2 gender sitdown when we ride membership
[2025-01-01T02:30:22] GABE: nah im sitting on that hoe man
[2025-01-01T02:30:25] GABE: trust
[2025-01-01T02:30:37] GABE: sitting master race
[2025-01-01T02:31:22] Noname: I stood on the Vsett today I'm sorry @Bradhaku
[2025-01-01T02:31:37] haku: membership revoked
[2025-01-01T02:31:41] haku: declined boy
[2025-01-01T02:31:55] Noname: I didn't know I swear
[2025-01-01T02:32:17] Noname: As punishment I froze my ass off
[2025-01-01T02:32:54] haku: tbh joking aside. idk if i can keep up with my boy standing. ill prolly give up riding in 1 hr
[2025-01-01T02:33:34] Noname: Don't skip leg day
[2025-01-01T02:33:37] haku: its a me problem not a standing problem. but we blame our problems on tge scooter just cause
[2025-01-01T02:34:56] Noname: Yeah me elbow started to act up. No rest when your flying on bumpy ass shit roads
[2025-01-01T02:34:59] haku: i just cant ride a scooter properly for some reason
[2025-01-01T02:35:14] Noname: Fake it till you make.it
[2025-01-01T03:01:56] Matte: Probably 70
[2025-01-01T03:28:43] Patrick: 150A peak
[2025-01-01T03:28:59] Patrick: 3V per cell with Vdrop, they can deliver it for ~60sec+-
[2025-01-01T03:30:12] 'lekrsu': No you don't
[2025-01-01T03:31:04] 'lekrsu': fuck why did I get thrown to 2023 by telegram, sorry
[2025-01-01T03:52:00] Jason: maybe we can
[2025-01-01T03:52:08] Jason: make rear light as blinker
[2025-01-01T04:08:44] Jan: The problem is for somebody from 10meters+ he will probably just see a backlight flashing in yellow
[2025-01-01T04:09:28] Jan: Handlebar grip endcaps is technically the best blinker spot you can have
[2025-01-01T04:14:05] Jason: ah lol
[2025-01-01T04:14:19] Jason: I wonder
[2025-01-01T04:14:28] Jason: somehow fitting the g2 blinker on g30
[2025-01-01T04:14:31] Jason: is it possible
[2025-01-01T04:16:07] 'lekrsu': Has specific grips and bars just to mount their design, with a 5cm~ screw connecting them together.
[2025-01-01T04:19:05] Patrick: Buy the aliexpress turn signals
[2025-01-01T04:19:22] Patrick: <photos/photo_20529@01-01-2025_04-19-22.jpg>
[2025-01-01T04:22:37] haku: i have those. cant get em to fit for some reason
[2025-01-01T04:25:22] Jason: ooh link?
[2025-01-01T04:25:33] Jason: ffs
[2025-01-01T04:25:37] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-01-01T04:28:18] Patrick: They Rubber part little too small
[2025-01-01T04:28:27] Patrick: I am going to 3D print something for mounting them
[2025-01-01T04:28:47] Patrick: Ich habe das hier gerade auf AliExpress gefunden: 19,68€ | 2 Stück 12V Motorrad griff Blinker für 22mm Lenker Bernstein Signal Licht Handgriff Ende Blinker Motorrad Zubehör https://a.aliexpress.com/_EQBdGQM
[2025-01-01T04:29:12] Patrick: Bright enough too
[2025-01-01T04:31:20] haku: adc module will make that blink yea?
[2025-01-01T06:12:03] Yamal: Happy new year
[2025-01-01T06:13:31] Yamal: Yesterday sleep at 9pm very tired ..wake up now! Let’s G0 !! 😂
[2025-01-01T06:32:03] Jason: ah I gotta change the handlebar
[2025-01-01T12:32:19] Matte: 20% voltage drop from nominal is crazy.
[2025-01-01T12:41:36] Patrick: I am just going to use a esp
[2025-01-01T12:43:01] Patrick: 3V per Cell is not really crazy when you go to Cell limit
[2025-01-01T14:30:46] Matte: It indicates the battery pack is not adequate for the load
[2025-01-01T14:35:33] 'lekrsu': What do you mean 'from nominal'? Depends on your actual voltage, not whatever they run at half charge.
[2025-01-01T14:36:33] Patrick: 3V is completly normal if you want to use full Power
[2025-01-01T17:02:16] Matte: 3.6V is nominal liion cell voltage
[2025-01-01T17:03:41] Matte: 3V is normal only if you are overwhelming the cell. Hard to call it full power if voltage drops to 3V per cell

[2025-01-01T22:53:29] Patrick: If you want to pull the most out of a cell they nearly all go down to 3V or lower

[2025-01-02T21:08:29] haku: i dont want to go fast with jetson. small battery. i just dont want overheating motors climbing a slightly steep hill 😭
[2025-01-02T21:08:57] haku: stock motors complete shit
[2025-01-02T21:09:30] haku: might be overkill for a 20s3p 35e
[2025-01-02T21:09:35] haku: yep
[2025-01-02T21:10:08] haku: i still want it light weight
[2025-01-02T21:10:37] haku: its sad when i have to stop and walk 😭
[2025-01-02T21:10:38] Smart Repair: Dual torque is even better
[2025-01-02T21:18:02] haku: this guy commited a woke crime on a tesla. guess what. they have all the information now. all the routes and telemetry like vesc baby
[2025-01-02T21:18:18] GABE: Wokes are into electric
[2025-01-02T21:18:29] GABE: This was a oil industry setup most likely
[2025-01-02T21:18:35] haku: agreed. that is a woke vehicle
[2025-01-02T21:18:50] haku: why em i called radiclal
[2025-01-02T21:19:10] GABE: Ya a lefty dont worry about it
[2025-01-02T21:19:42] GABE: wonder how much tesla stock went down after that setup
[2025-01-02T21:19:44] GABE: 20% maybe
[2025-01-02T21:20:07] haku: no idea. but that woke idiot prolly lost money shorting it
[2025-01-02T21:20:18] GABE: Hopefully he messed it up
[2025-01-02T21:20:27] GABE: stocks are like bidding on horses to them
[2025-01-02T21:21:03] GABE: if he pulled it off he couldve bought a new cybertruck by now
[2025-01-02T21:21:05] GABE: and then some
[2025-01-02T21:21:06] haku: doesnt matter the stock value. i see tesla sales here in person and its good
[2025-01-02T21:21:34] haku: some houses have 2 or 3 model y
[2025-01-02T21:21:54] GABE: tesla is cool, i just dont like the cybertruck
[2025-01-02T21:21:59] GABE: their SEXY models are perfect
[2025-01-02T21:22:02] GABE: they look like cars
[2025-01-02T21:22:09] haku: when i make my yt video. ill make a video count all the teslas
[2025-01-02T21:22:56] haku: cybertruck is for the super fanboy tools that can afford it
[2025-01-02T21:23:08] GABE: tools, good name
[2025-01-02T21:23:50] haku: the other model teslas are affordable now
[2025-01-02T21:24:03] GABE: id never buy an ecar id rather convert
[2025-01-02T21:24:11] GABE: comes out to the same price lol
[2025-01-02T21:24:35] haku: its good for city driving. but if your a country boy good luck
[2025-01-02T21:25:16] haku: tesla fast chargers every 5 mile radius here
[2025-01-02T21:27:36] haku: tesla is for the law abiding citizens. if your woke it will self snitch on you
[2025-01-02T21:34:35] haku: i would salvage the 4680s still left in here. im sure they are still usable.
[2025-01-02T21:43:30] GABE: theyre only like 15a cells
[2025-01-02T21:43:33] GABE: not worth it
[2025-01-02T21:43:51] haku: still be cool though
[2025-01-02T21:43:55] GABE: Yeah sure giant ass cells
[2025-01-02T21:44:05] haku: perfect for wepoor
[2025-01-02T21:44:47] haku: i will wear those cells like a bandoleer just like rambo
[2025-01-02T21:47:04] haku: 22s worn like a bandoleer while riding jetson bolt
[2025-01-02T22:51:02] David: @jamessoderstrom Can you check DMs?
[2025-01-02T22:51:54] haku: james busy man!
[2025-01-02T23:11:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He checks and forgets 😁😂😭
[2025-01-02T23:11:51] haku: can you run a vesc without bluetooth?
[2025-01-02T23:12:23] haku: i only have 2 modules. and wepoor needs it atm
[2025-01-02T23:12:46] David: He is busy And our hours have big difference So when I send him a message he sleep and message disappear due overload on his account
[2025-01-02T23:14:30] haku: legend has it you dont ask james questions. he asks you.
[2025-01-02T23:16:11] NetworkDir: Yes but for setup you need to usb and pc
[2025-01-02T23:16:29] Noname: Just swap it back
[2025-01-02T23:16:30] David: 😂
[2025-01-02T23:16:31] haku: gotcha thanks
[2025-01-02T23:16:42] NetworkDir: Also 1 module enough for 2 controllers if connected together.
[2025-01-02T23:19:50] Noname: He sets up his away message with answer before you ask
[2025-01-02T23:21:41] NetworkDir: Also you can use esp32 via rx-tx or better solution with esp32-c3 + tja1050(can bus module) with vesc express Also you can recycle ninebot developed dashboards with nrf module
[2025-01-02T23:21:42] haku: man this terrorist attack on my city makes me want to join the armed forces. im thinking space force
[2025-01-02T23:22:00] haku: do you think they will take me?
[2025-01-02T23:23:14] Noname: Your not from space?
[2025-01-02T23:23:58] Noname: Anyone figure out simple cruise controll. I searched and found some code but I'm a computer moron
[2025-01-02T23:25:52] haku: i need to learn what those words mean first before i attempt it bit thanks
[2025-01-02T23:26:27] haku: i think i have a es3 dash with nrf
[2025-01-02T23:26:48] haku: get spinny
[2025-01-02T23:27:18] Noname: Fuck no. I have one
[2025-01-02T23:27:32] Noname: Although
[2025-01-02T23:27:34] haku: the v2?
[2025-01-02T23:27:39] Noname: 1
[2025-01-02T23:27:39] haku: v2 i like
[2025-01-02T23:27:59] haku: 1 handed controls
[2025-01-02T23:28:11] Noname: I could wire my throttle to it and use the button
[2025-01-02T23:28:29] haku: idk what difference is in v1 vs v2
[2025-01-02T23:28:33] Noname: Thanks for the idea
[2025-01-02T23:28:40] GABE: @the_hackintosh did you pack the 1kg leaded solder with the 3 motors?
[2025-01-02T23:28:52] GABE: i want all of it
[2025-01-02T23:29:00] GABE: check dms more often
[2025-01-02T23:29:03] Noname: More reverse
[2025-01-02T23:29:31] Noname: 50/50 and easier set up or whatever
[2025-01-02T23:30:39] NetworkDir: So you can use it
[2025-01-02T23:31:07] haku: do i have to remove nrf chip or i have to use the whole dash?
[2025-01-02T23:31:16] NetworkDir: Also if you have a spintend you can flash without stlink Because spintend have a flash pinouts
[2025-01-02T23:31:24] NetworkDir: You can remove it and use
[2025-01-02T23:33:15] NetworkDir: 1 3.3v 2-3 gnd 4-5 rx tx
[2025-01-02T23:33:31] NetworkDir: <files/nrf51_vesc_ble_16k_16m_rx11_tx9_led3.bin>
[2025-01-02T23:33:31] NetworkDir: rx 11 tx 9
[2025-01-02T23:33:32] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. NetworkDir has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-02T23:33:40] haku: gotcha thanks. i remember we had a talk about this
[2025-01-02T23:34:15] haku: someone please give network unlimited talk.
[2025-01-02T23:34:30] 'lekrsu': Wanna do that to this;)
[2025-01-02T23:34:47] haku: only me and @jamaludin_algarnati should be in rose jail
[2025-01-02T23:35:23] GABE: you do hahaha
[2025-01-02T23:35:26] 'lekrsu': Oh nice, where's this from?
[2025-01-02T23:36:20] NetworkDir: But i advice you before removing chip Flash with pcb pinouts and take it from pcb
[2025-01-02T23:36:36] NetworkDir: https://github.com/vedderb/nrf51_vesc/tree/master/build_all
[2025-01-02T23:37:59] 'lekrsu': Yeah, nice. I have the 16kb nrf
[2025-01-02T23:39:09] Smart Repair: How is it possible to log 2 ESCs that run dual via CAN individually? I can't get all the values from the second ESC via vesc express. Would it be possible to connect a Bluetooth dongle to both ESCs and use 2 mobile phones to log them?
[2025-01-02T23:39:33] David: Why??
[2025-01-02T23:39:52] Patrick: I have the same question very long time 😄
[2025-01-02T23:41:33] GABE: Whoever wants to beat me to it before i make it, a dual motor 60kw QS E-kart. now is your time to take the world record, because i wont be for another 18 months minimum.
[2025-01-02T23:41:49] GABE: 24*

[2025-01-02T23:43:12] NetworkDir: I think vesc express😄
[2025-01-02T23:43:17] haku: sit down or be a squatter. 2 choices
[2025-01-02T23:43:19] GABE: hyper m365 is getting a seat asap when cell is made
[2025-01-02T23:43:35] GABE: soldered with leaded solder*
[2025-01-02T23:43:55] haku: dont go all out bro. fix your welder dam
[2025-01-02T23:44:03] GABE: classes start too soon
[2025-01-02T23:44:05] GABE: i cant flunk this year
[2025-01-02T23:44:10] GABE: if it wont stick ill grind away anyways
[2025-01-02T23:44:20] GABE: try again with a welder
[2025-01-02T23:44:43] haku: like i said i have standards to my jank
[2025-01-02T23:44:50] GABE: ive already flunked semester 1 and will have to pay 3000 to repeat it so ill have to work full time in a quarter
[2025-01-02T23:45:14] GABE: if i flunk semester 2 its another 3000 on top
[2025-01-02T23:45:29] haku: yea dont do that.
[2025-01-02T23:45:46] GABE: daniel printed the spacer for me
[2025-01-02T23:45:48] GABE: 32.5mm
[2025-01-02T23:45:50] haku: but also dont believe what genders thier teaching in you uni
[2025-01-02T23:45:58] GABE: heh here theyre so neutral theres nothing
[2025-01-02T23:46:02] GABE: being taught at all
[2025-01-02T23:46:06] GABE: irish are pretty neutral
[2025-01-02T23:46:08] haku: good
[2025-01-02T23:46:31] GABE: the 20s2p uses 100% of the available space inside lol
[2025-01-02T23:46:34] GABE: no space wasted
[2025-01-02T23:46:38] GABE: like G30 6p
[2025-01-02T23:46:48] haku: nice
[2025-01-02T23:46:54] GABE: m365 can hold 600wh but come with 280
[2025-01-02T23:46:57] GABE: a joke
[2025-01-02T23:47:14] GABE: the new motor daniel sold me is a brand new 250w
[2025-01-02T23:47:18] GABE: never raped with fwk or anything its gonna last FOREVER 20s no fwk at all
[2025-01-02T23:47:36] haku: nice. what motor?
[2025-01-02T23:47:45] haku: daniel seems a good dude
[2025-01-02T23:47:46] GABE: M365 Essential motor
[2025-01-02T23:47:51] GABE: theyre so well made
[2025-01-02T23:47:55] GABE: they burn with fwk thp
[2025-01-02T23:47:56] GABE: tho
[2025-01-02T23:48:00] GABE: no issue i can go 60kmh anyways
[2025-01-02T23:48:00] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-02T23:48:01] haku: i see
[2025-01-02T23:49:03] haku: xiaomi motor good then.
[2025-01-02T23:51:06] GABE: Ximi motors are gas
[2025-01-02T23:51:10] GABE: @XAP2P can VOUCH
[2025-01-02T23:51:17] GABE: ill have 2 motors too
[2025-01-02T23:51:22] GABE: and that 2p can deliver
[2025-01-02T23:51:24] GABE: efficiency UP
[2025-01-02T23:51:24] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-02T23:51:59] haku: i like this. when i think of ireland connor mcgreggor comes to mind cocky based mfs. haha
[2025-01-02T23:53:26] Smart Repair: Manual logging with vesc tool via bluetooth only gives me the 6 values ​​as in the picture. And via VESC express I only get 1 ESC logged. Logui is installed on both ECS and auto log at start is activated.
[2025-01-02T23:54:09] GABE: issue is make blocks to mount motor on rear
[2025-01-02T23:54:14] GABE: have to be CNC'd unforch
[2025-01-02T23:54:16] GABE: prob not worth it
[2025-01-02T23:54:31] GABE: this isnt the scooter i wanna blow cash on, its the cheapo scoot
[2025-01-02T23:55:03] NetworkDir: Ah so for this you should enable vesc can messages
[2025-01-02T23:55:05] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is he brit ?
[2025-01-02T23:55:13] GABE: we talking 60km range idk how but they do it, those big 60h motors need mega amps to get started 2.1kw to get to 60kmh, gets simplified to 35w/km, but thats too much
[2025-01-02T23:56:33] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_20567@02-01-2025_23-56-33.jpg>
[2025-01-02T23:56:57] Smart Repair: A catch here?
[2025-01-02T23:58:37] NetworkDir: Yes I think but you should enable the messages from slave vesc
[2025-01-02T23:58:43] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_20569@02-01-2025_23-58-43.jpg>

[2025-01-03T00:00:35] Smart Repair: Among other things, I still miss the motor and Mosfet temperature
[2025-01-03T00:01:18] GABE: @TherealLizardDoggo has a dual essential motor m365, looks stock as fuck
[2025-01-03T00:01:55] Smart Repair: does can status rate also have to be set to 10Hz?
[2025-01-03T00:04:58] 'lekrsu': Flashed it with Reflasher, the other programs refused to work.
[2025-01-03T00:09:51] Smart Repair: I enabled Can value and it works. I thank you
[2025-01-03T00:10:36] Smart Repair: 👌
[2025-01-03T00:11:08] NetworkDir: No problem :)
[2025-01-03T00:11:37] NetworkDir: I flash with openocd
[2025-01-03T00:11:55] NetworkDir: You flash over BLE?
[2025-01-03T00:12:05] 'lekrsu': No, ST-linked it
[2025-01-03T00:12:12] NetworkDir: Ah ok
[2025-01-03T00:12:18] 'lekrsu': Used 3.3V, maybe thats why.
[2025-01-03T00:12:30] NetworkDir: Maybe..
[2025-01-03T00:12:35] 'lekrsu': STM32 Utility refused to work at all.
[2025-01-03T00:12:36] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: lol I did rear gen1 g30 and then broke frame again.
[2025-01-03T00:12:43] GABE: qhich frame
[2025-01-03T00:12:48] NetworkDir: Ah because nrf wasnt stm
[2025-01-03T00:12:59] NetworkDir: We just use stlink like bridge
[2025-01-03T00:13:02] NetworkDir: Yeah
[2025-01-03T00:13:15] NetworkDir: ScooterHacking reflasher use openocd also
[2025-01-03T00:13:20] 'lekrsu': Yeh
[2025-01-03T00:13:27] 'lekrsu': Can I connect it to 5V on the nrf vesc port?
[2025-01-03T00:13:54] NetworkDir: I don't test it but I don't recommend 😄
[2025-01-03T00:14:13] 'lekrsu': These duponts are so badly fitted
[2025-01-03T00:14:22] NetworkDir: Most mcu like stm, nrf, esp use 3.3V
[2025-01-03T00:14:31] NetworkDir: Shitty chinese ebike controllers 5V
[2025-01-03T00:18:28] 'lekrsu': I'll check out Vedders documentation on the nrf51 repo. He's got the openocd command included there ^^'
[2025-01-03T00:23:32] 'lekrsu': https://github.com/vedderb/nrf51_vesc?tab=readme-ov-file
[2025-01-03T00:27:13] 'lekrsu': No JST's of this kind left unused. Can I use nrf port's rx tx? I suppose it makes no difference
[2025-01-03T00:49:03] haku: sitdown when we ride is vegas strong baby.
[2025-01-03T01:07:16] 'lekrsu': Already flashed though, ;)
[2025-01-03T01:08:29] 'lekrsu': Is the swd port on the top otherwise or below the cover?
[2025-01-03T01:16:03] haku: wolves den.
[2025-01-03T01:17:54] haku: jetson perfect for walking dog but not commuting
[2025-01-03T01:18:13] 'lekrsu': Yeah @jamessoderstrom my Lite's don't have a jst for that
[2025-01-03T01:31:54] haku: why cant i post my very important message
[2025-01-03T01:43:42] Smart Repair: Would it be possible to connect this or another touch display to vesc and use it as a dashboard on the scooter? If so, it would be possible to switch via the display profile
[2025-01-03T01:58:27] Smart Repair: And what option is there if that exceeds my abilities?
[2025-01-03T02:18:34] Marius: paying someone that has the abilities to do it for you
[2025-01-03T02:18:57] Marius: or finding someone that does it for free ig
[2025-01-03T02:44:09] haku: finally riding at night. just the sidewalk like a bitch
[2025-01-03T02:51:22] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: General question why tf you need display
[2025-01-03T03:25:39] Smart Repair: I want to convert my GT1 to ADC and replace the stock dash with a display of approximately the same size
[2025-01-03T03:54:18] Smart Repair: The GT display is connected to the ESC via a bridge via UART. I was told that it is not possible to use temporal ADC
[2025-01-03T03:55:06] Smart Repair: I have installed the bridge, but I would like to have the throttle and brake directly on the ESC.
[2025-01-03T03:57:33] Smart Repair: For example, the GT does not have a variable e-brake and there is no way to adjust the throttle curve or ramping time.
[2025-01-03T04:02:28] Smart Repair: No, I haven't tested it yet. But I'll try it later. If it works, it would be perfect. Then I can leave the bridge in and continue to use its functions.
[2025-01-03T04:05:39] Mirono escooters: Suspect was far from "woke"
[2025-01-03T04:06:18] Mirono escooters: Wonder what his motive was here 😅
[2025-01-03T04:06:32] haku: eh. its a cover up. its very deep
[2025-01-03T04:06:37] Mirono escooters: Sure bud
[2025-01-03T04:07:01] haku: inform yourself miro. im worried about you
[2025-01-03T04:07:16] Mirono escooters: Dw, I just read facts and see from there
[2025-01-03T04:07:31] haku: where you find these "facts"
[2025-01-03T04:07:42] Mirono escooters: Camera footage ?
[2025-01-03T04:08:06] haku: las vegas metro cant even explain the vegas shooting back in 2018 i think
[2025-01-03T04:08:08] Mirono escooters: "facts" stop it buddy, I'm not that type of moron to repeat news articles 1:1
[2025-01-03T04:08:57] Mirono escooters: I see video, I see photo of suspect, I see flag of some known terrorist organisation, I see his old social posts I make my mind up from that. Not whatever you think is my source of info
[2025-01-03T04:09:28] haku: its a green beret guy thats suppose to be a trump supporter and deployed in germany and has ukraine ties.
[2025-01-03T04:09:36] Mirono escooters: Sergeant in US military. Special forces
[2025-01-03T04:09:39] Mirono escooters: High ranked dude
[2025-01-03T04:10:03] haku: those guys know how to make real bombs. not gas cans and fireworks
[2025-01-03T04:10:06] Mirono escooters: Again, I wonder what he wanted to achieve here lol
[2025-01-03T04:10:13] Mirono escooters: Didn't hurt anyone, only himself 😅
[2025-01-03T04:10:31] Mirono escooters: And made a spectacular firework And he kinda showed how badass the cyber truck is. That thing didn't have a dent.
[2025-01-03T04:10:46] Mirono escooters: Did you even see the vid? It was spectacular
[2025-01-03T04:10:47] haku: its still an act of terrorism in my city. i will not allow it
[2025-01-03T04:10:55] Mirono escooters: Yes but not done by your woke boys
[2025-01-03T04:11:09] haku: not my boys.
[2025-01-03T04:11:33] haku: what kind of my boys would choose a tesla and detonate infront of trump tower
[2025-01-03T04:11:40] Mirono escooters: Here's a insane idea: sometimes people go mad without political reasons..
[2025-01-03T04:11:43] haku: with gas cans and fireworks
[2025-01-03T04:12:00] Mirono escooters: Not yet
[2025-01-03T04:12:13] Mirono escooters: Gas can can be identified. Rest is speculations
[2025-01-03T04:12:17] Mirono escooters: Haha gas can
[2025-01-03T04:12:18] haku: fireworks and gas cans was on the bed of the truck
[2025-01-03T04:12:23] Mirono escooters: No
[2025-01-03T04:12:26] Mirono escooters: He shot himself
[2025-01-03T04:12:56] Mirono escooters: <video_file>
[2025-01-03T04:13:00] Smart Repair: The throttle is connected to the dashboard. I suspect that there will be an error if there is no throttle. But that should be able to be fixed with a resistor on the signal input. I'm curious
[2025-01-03T04:13:07] Mirono escooters: Anyone calling that a small explosion will be banned On a serious note, it's quite a boom
[2025-01-03T04:13:26] haku: ok here is just an idea. you know tesla has a summon and self drive feature yea. you can park any tesal on any building aslong as there is a body in the driver seat
[2025-01-03T04:13:29] Mirono escooters: Truck looked intact lol, insane Guess he hoped for battery fire?
[2025-01-03T04:14:02] Mirono escooters: It detects when you are asleep. It'll 100% detect a dead human. Let alone park itself that nice without any interaction
[2025-01-03T04:14:19] haku: not when your wearing sunglasses. i do it all the time
[2025-01-03T04:14:32] Mirono escooters: Explain how it parked like that then 😂
[2025-01-03T04:15:03] haku: it found a vallet spot
[2025-01-03T04:15:33] haku: its more to it than the news and fbi is telling us
[2025-01-03T04:15:47] Mirono escooters: Livelsberger was the only fatality and the blast lightly wounded seven others. Las Vegas Metropolitan #Police noted that “The fact that this was a Cybertruck really limited the damage that occurred inside of the valet, because it had most of the blast go up through the truck and out.”
[2025-01-03T04:15:55] Mirono escooters: Car quality 👍
[2025-01-03T04:16:31] haku: good for elon. but sad day still. terrorism of any kind will not be tolerated woke or not
[2025-01-03T04:16:49] Mirono escooters: Dude. Like you wouldn't go nuts after years of special deployment to the most extreme shitholes in the world. Leave it to be, we will see what new information emerges and then make up our minds
[2025-01-03T04:17:02] Mirono escooters: We share facts here, not conspiracies lol
[2025-01-03T04:17:13] Mirono escooters: If anything, cyber truck earned it's name
[2025-01-03T04:17:17] haku: dude was deployed in germany. we know what that country is about
[2025-01-03T04:17:29] Mirono escooters: I live right next to Germany. Wanna teach me about it?
[2025-01-03T04:17:32] Mirono escooters: You live in the US lol
[2025-01-03T04:17:48] haku: wokemind virus is spreading in germany
[2025-01-03T04:18:10] Mirono escooters: I'm tired of it, haku. Stop it. He didn't go woke from being deployed in Germany 😂
[2025-01-03T04:18:39] haku: we will find out more if they release it
[2025-01-03T04:19:04] Mirono escooters: Let's end the day on "any kind of terrorism will not be tolerated, woke or not" Terrorism is terrorism, and wrong. And we should not care who did it or why. We should pray for the injured ones instead
[2025-01-03T04:19:27] haku: thats just my opinion. look at @SirModAlot here. before he went to germany he believed in 2 gender policy. after that idk what happened to him
[2025-01-03T04:19:39] Mirono escooters: Poor Gabe
[2025-01-03T04:20:08] haku: new orleans had it worse tbh. that one was clear radical stuff
[2025-01-03T04:21:39] haku: this should unite americans. the wokemind virus is the real enemy -haku 2023
[2025-01-03T05:04:40] Mirono escooters: How about terrorists are the real enemy
[2025-01-03T05:04:46] Mirono escooters: That sounds a bit better
[2025-01-03T05:06:04] haku: i just said that
[2025-01-03T05:06:32] Mirono escooters: Why mention wokemind virus then? Seems to be drifting away from the main point
[2025-01-03T05:06:47] haku: terrorism is an act of violence from the woke
[2025-01-03T05:07:15] haku: only people that condone this has a woke mimdset
[2025-01-03T05:07:24] Mirono escooters: No one condones terrorism
[2025-01-03T05:07:31] Mirono escooters: And dont try and tell me ISIS is woke
[2025-01-03T05:07:45] Mirono escooters: You are jumping some steps buddy. It don't make sense
[2025-01-03T05:07:50] haku: it is. all terrorists
[2025-01-03T05:08:27] haku: 2 guy who shot on our president is woke af. thats an act of terrorism
[2025-01-03T05:08:40] Mirono escooters: Ah yes sure. The people with the beards who make their wife's dress up like curtains and are so strict they can't do anything alone? Ah yes. They are defenitely woke
[2025-01-03T05:09:14] Mirono escooters: Yeah no shit, no trumpie is gonna shoot his own president elect
[2025-01-03T05:09:32] haku: well thats what they do if they cant censor you they will do terrorist stuff
[2025-01-03T05:10:01] haku: thats the next logical step
[2025-01-03T05:10:13] Mirono escooters: I can censor you. So I'd advise you to stop talking gibberish and go walk your dog or go to sleep
[2025-01-03T05:10:20] Mirono escooters: This convo was useful till this point
[2025-01-03T05:10:37] haku: your not the big boss here. its a council here
[2025-01-03T05:10:54] haku: go ahead censor me
[2025-01-03T05:11:21] Mirono escooters: Now the mere mortal is gonna pester the gods
[2025-01-03T05:11:23] haku: your mind is infected miro.
[2025-01-03T05:11:41] Mirono escooters: And that's it. I'm not taking more personal bullshit
[2025-01-03T05:11:50] haku: good
[2025-01-03T05:11:52] Mirono escooters: I don't think you got anything to say about my mind
[2025-01-03T05:12:16] haku: all you guys do is censor
[2025-01-03T05:12:23] haku: nothing else.
[2025-01-03T05:13:00] Mirono escooters: Womp womp
[2025-01-03T05:13:48] haku: you shouldnt be admin here. with all due respect. you abuse your power
[2025-01-03T05:13:56] Mirono escooters: Stop talking about me or my thinking, and no conspiracy stuff that even 4chan is jealous about and we aren't censoring anyone
[2025-01-03T05:14:16] Mirono escooters: We've banned like 2 people in these past few years Don't go and be a crybaby
[2025-01-03T05:14:37] haku: im not a victim boy. i dont cry for the woke
[2025-01-03T05:14:39] Mirono escooters: I do nothing and you womp
[2025-01-03T05:15:14] haku: or girl. sorry if i got your pronouns wrong. with all due respect
[2025-01-03T05:15:23] Mirono escooters: I tried to be nice to you but I'm nearing some limits. Think we all are. You've changed over these past months. We've known you long enough to see past this
[2025-01-03T05:15:36] Mirono escooters: Oh fuck off, I don't do that stuff
[2025-01-03T05:15:51] haku: ive been talking like this since i fist joined
[2025-01-03T05:16:08] haku: suddenly im the bad guy after election 😭
[2025-01-03T05:16:52] Mirono escooters: Says who?
[2025-01-03T05:17:04] Mirono escooters: We don't care about politics. Or Amerika. 80% here doesn't even live in the US
[2025-01-03T05:17:10] haku: says you and your woke buds
[2025-01-03T05:17:14] Mirono escooters: Why would we fucking care. Get a grip
[2025-01-03T05:17:23] Mirono escooters: I'm far from woke
[2025-01-03T05:17:48] haku: didnt you say you dont watch anything but US polotics
[2025-01-03T05:18:54] haku: XD I follow us politics more then ours
[2025-01-03T05:19:04] haku: facts boys
[2025-01-03T05:19:27] Mirono escooters: I do, yes
[2025-01-03T05:19:31] Mirono escooters: Most here don't care about it
[2025-01-03T05:19:43] haku: then why watch it
[2025-01-03T05:19:48] Mirono escooters: I have stocks in US. Wouldn't it be logical I follow it?
[2025-01-03T05:19:55] haku: so you can be brainwashed
[2025-01-03T05:20:12] Mirono escooters: Oh yeah, that makes way more sense.
[2025-01-03T05:20:23] haku: i already told you wich stocks to invest. tesla and pltr
[2025-01-03T05:20:39] haku: but you said too late to jump on that train 😭
[2025-01-03T05:20:44] Mirono escooters: Tesla? The stock that reported a drop in deliveries? 🫠
[2025-01-03T05:21:01] Mirono escooters: I'm not your financial advisor
[2025-01-03T05:21:11] haku: you asked me remember
[2025-01-03T05:22:07] haku: it is what it is miro. kick me or block me.
[2025-01-03T05:22:23] haku: simple as that
[2025-01-03T05:23:01] haku: not even the owner of this group nor the other admins have any problems with how i talk
[2025-01-03T05:23:08] Mirono escooters: Shut up about far fetched woke theories and talk about scooters, like we all do
[2025-01-03T05:23:24] Mirono escooters: It's not that hard
[2025-01-03T05:23:33] haku: how many scooter projecta have i posted.
[2025-01-03T05:23:39] Mirono escooters: Bringing politics into stuff isn't helping. It doesn't add any value. It merely creates chaos
[2025-01-03T05:23:52] haku: it comes with the words. it aint free
[2025-01-03T05:24:39] haku: this is a safeplace for free speech not hate speech dont be a censor whore
[2025-01-03T05:25:24] haku: your starting to show your true colors miro. blueman or purpleman
[2025-01-03T05:25:31] Mirono escooters: You started with your hate speech
[2025-01-03T05:25:44] haku: what hate speech had i said
[2025-01-03T05:25:51] Mirono escooters: We were talking about a event with facts and you started talking far fetched conspiracy theories based on hot air
[2025-01-03T05:26:09] haku: use common sense miro
[2025-01-03T05:26:12] Mirono escooters: So far I've only shown a video and a dude's name

[2025-01-03T05:26:37] Mirono escooters: Ah yeah, forgot. Defenitely the libs
[2025-01-03T05:27:10] Mirono escooters: Who else would plant fireworks in a huge riding stainless steel car capable of murdering hundreds of people by driving over em /s
[2025-01-03T05:27:34] haku: i dont care libs or conservative. im center and my views are 2 gender policy plain and simple
[2025-01-03T05:28:43] haku: go join your woke buddy and sensor someone in that group. leave this group alome
[2025-01-03T05:28:45] Mirono escooters: Center is best. Common sense, no extremes. Peace out ✌️
[2025-01-03T05:28:58] Mirono escooters: And there it is. The personal attack Leave that out man

[2025-01-03T09:31:24] Finn: Personal atrack behine his back😁
[2025-01-03T09:33:44] Mirono escooters: Convince haku to leave it behind
[2025-01-03T09:34:07] Mirono escooters: You pick that one out?
[2025-01-03T09:34:23] Mirono escooters: Or is this sarcastic🤪
[2025-01-03T09:34:40] Finn: Why should it be sarcastic?
[2025-01-03T09:35:33] Mirono escooters: Half arsed screenshot leaving out context
[2025-01-03T09:35:58] Finn: You know the context
[2025-01-03T09:36:06] Finn: Dont need to explain more
[2025-01-03T09:36:07] Mirono escooters: Yes, so why post that screen without it?
[2025-01-03T09:36:33] Mirono escooters: I think it's ok to call him moron after he mocked me in every group he could lol
[2025-01-03T09:36:47] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_20578@03-01-2025_09-36-47.jpg>
[2025-01-03T09:36:51] Mirono escooters: Here, context 👍
[2025-01-03T09:36:52] Finn: An "admin" should behave different😂😂
[2025-01-03T09:37:15] Mirono escooters: That's all you got to say about this?
[2025-01-03T09:37:29] Mirono escooters: Thanks for the argument😂
[2025-01-03T09:37:48] Finn: Oh man yeah this is fucked
[2025-01-03T09:37:55] Mirono escooters: He left himself I didn't do shit behind his back Why am I having this discussion
[2025-01-03T09:38:16] Finn: You clearly did in the group
[2025-01-03T09:38:24] Mirono escooters: "haku left the group"
[2025-01-03T09:38:35] Mirono escooters: Not the sharpest tool in the shed are ya
[2025-01-03T09:39:03] Finn: Should that be an insult?
[2025-01-03T09:39:11] Finn: You arent really a competent admin arent ya
[2025-01-03T09:39:13] Mirono escooters: Yes, yes it should

[2025-01-03T09:39:32] Finn: Admin insulting members
[2025-01-03T09:39:47] Mirono escooters: Cuz I'm a admin I'm not allowed to do so?
[2025-01-03T09:40:10] Finn: <animation>
[2025-01-03T09:40:12] Mirono escooters: After he mocked me for hours? You nitpick 1 message? After he left voluntary? Did you miss his message above where he called me a "woke asshole"?
[2025-01-03T09:40:13] Finn: Youre this rn
[2025-01-03T09:40:16] Mirono escooters: That's ok in your opinion?

[2025-01-03T09:40:38] Finn: Look im like you
[2025-01-03T09:40:41] Finn: 1:1
[2025-01-03T09:40:48] Mirono escooters: It's not even your beef, why bother?
[2025-01-03T09:40:50] Mirono escooters: Bored much?
[2025-01-03T09:41:05] Finn: I just like to clarify things
[2025-01-03T09:41:12] Finn: And this is clearly going in the wrong direction
[2025-01-03T09:41:27] Mirono escooters: Uhm, you started with a out of context screenshot, ignoring his part of this whole discussion
[2025-01-03T09:41:34] Mirono escooters: I'm just clarifying and trying to be civil
[2025-01-03T09:41:37] Finn: Ypu knew the context exactly
[2025-01-03T09:41:56] Mirono escooters: The people here didn't, yet you thought it would be good to spread a out of context screenshot?
[2025-01-03T09:42:05] Mirono escooters: You really don't see the issue?
[2025-01-03T09:42:20] Mirono escooters: Anyway, it's not your problem, why make it? This is between haku, me, and the admins
[2025-01-03T09:42:55] Mirono escooters: That's up to the admin team. If they decide haku is in the right, I will publicly apologize and give up my admin powers
[2025-01-03T09:43:11] Finn: You should doing it anyways. Tbh
[2025-01-03T09:43:57] Mirono escooters: That's your opinion

[2025-01-03T12:28:17] Matte: What do you mean they are 15 amp cells?
[2025-01-03T12:32:56] Matte: how surprising
[2025-01-03T12:41:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: More or less the same

[2025-01-03T12:43:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But I'm 30kg less then sabi so I'll do on your zero10x probably 110kmh
[2025-01-03T12:43:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Oh and btw @punedir I sold the 10x battery to afford battery for my new beast

[2025-01-03T13:39:37] GABE: Not as powerful as M50LT by kwh, the 21700 tesla variant anyways.
[2025-01-03T13:40:05] GABE: i worded my statement wrong, i meant they dont have much power to weight, if they were 21700 they would be 15a cells ish
[2025-01-03T13:41:39] GABE: P45b is better if M50LT would be used for teslas they would have the same peak power to motors i can do the maths right now
[2025-01-03T13:41:51] GABE: what are the specs?

[2025-01-03T16:16:10] Yamal: I buy just the last month ?
[2025-01-03T16:18:23] Yamal: 30 November,,
[2025-01-03T16:33:45] Andrei Albert: Yess, freespin
[2025-01-03T16:33:51] Andrei Albert: But 120 tested now
[2025-01-03T16:35:33] GABE: <photos/photo_20594@03-01-2025_16-35-33.jpg>
[2025-01-03T16:36:15] GABE: Comes out to peak 700kw power plaid mode Told everyone Tesla cells are dog shit P45 would yield 2.5mw with the Tesla cell Layout @No1Matte
[2025-01-03T16:36:50] Yamal: Always connect to the rear motor, it is clear that your scooter is well above 120
[2025-01-03T16:38:11] Yamal: you are above 160 and below 200
[2025-01-03T16:39:10] Yamal: now every time your scooter goes out onto the street in Romania it stops time
[2025-01-03T16:39:19] Yamal: 🫰
[2025-01-03T16:40:06] Yamal: Roxe,?
[2025-01-03T16:40:06] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-03T16:42:28] No: Hi everyone, can someone telle me what setting im supposed to change to get more torque at start ? I tried different things with the throttle settings but nothing really convicing
[2025-01-03T16:46:20] Matte: 2.5 milliwatt? My watch battery does better.
[2025-01-03T16:47:05] Smart Repair: Are the 111kmh correct? I can't get over 95kmh with a 70 H 22x3 85/250.
[2025-01-03T16:47:32] Matte: Thing is Gabe, im not interested in what you got to say. Not now not ever.
[2025-01-03T16:49:05] GABE: we use assumption to assume megawatt no?
[2025-01-03T16:49:26] GABE: I have more important things to attend to than making sure some online buddy can figure out if I mean MW or mw power of an electric car.
[2025-01-03T16:50:05] GABE: I can't seem to find a replacement for this GEE TVs diode, None online match the design of this one. kinda stuck here, is there a datasheet for the 801D or am I delusional? @Mirono_escooters
[2025-01-03T16:50:46] GABE: This is my first time even seeing you here. do send the 4680 datasheet after you've tested the cells yourself, though. I do want to see the information on those. Also, this is offtopic for a reason, it's so I can spew shit and not interrupt general. You hanging out in offtopic just proves youre into this kind of speak. You're feeding yourself shit you don't wanna see and are being toxic in return and starting arguments and youre bitter.
[2025-01-03T16:51:14] Yamal: My top speed gps it’s 115kmh
[2025-01-03T16:52:11] 'lekrsu': More phase current, and throttle under adc to 0s rather than 0.2-0.3s.
[2025-01-03T16:52:42] Yamal: How it’s your battery , and how many A battery A phase you have ,,?
[2025-01-03T16:52:52] No: Thanks I'll try this
[2025-01-03T17:02:15] Smart Repair: 20s 450A cells with 500A peak BMS, 1#ESC 250 ubox, 70H, 170A Batt current, 250A Phase and 60A fw. 2#ESC 150 ubox, stock GT1 motor, 170A Batt, 120A Phase and 30A fw. I can't currently go higher with the current because the Batt current is the same in both ESCs and the software currently only accepts a maximum of 250A phase 🤷‍♂️
[2025-01-03T17:04:36] Smart Repair: If I go higher with the battery current, I'm afraid of destroying the 150 ubox. How much phase do you have?
[2025-01-03T17:26:02] GABE: Can only see precise detail on video so I provided one, I think Since caps are 5.8v it would be a 6V diode?? kicks it to ground said James so must be VDC
[2025-01-03T18:03:50] Yamal: 200 phase 150 battery
[2025-01-03T18:14:36] Yamal: Tom has also done the programming and that also has to do with it.
[2025-01-03T18:20:01] Happy Giraffe: 80kwh worth of 45B is around 800kw now stop the nonsense
[2025-01-03T18:21:09] GABE: Oh shit youre right, i stand corrected. Thanks for atleast proving my numbers wrong and not being an bum like the other guy.
[2025-01-03T18:21:20] GABE: +1.
[2025-01-03T18:23:04] Smart Repair: you have dual right?
[2025-01-03T18:24:40] Yamal: Yes
[2025-01-03T18:25:00] Yamal: My power max 21kw?
[2025-01-03T18:25:44] Yamal: always without field weakening
[2025-01-03T18:26:13] Yamal: Also traction control -5000rmp
[2025-01-03T18:26:53] Yamal: I really need new motor,, for be complete the Nami but can’t now, new project coming,, different frame

[2025-01-03T19:52:13] Smart Repair: I just noticed it now without fw
[2025-01-03T19:52:22] Andrei Albert: Will test it but its very cold now
[2025-01-03T19:52:23] Yamal: Fw no need
[2025-01-03T19:52:35] Yamal: 22/3 “””torque motor””
[2025-01-03T19:52:47] Finn: Its balanced at 70H
[2025-01-03T19:52:58] Yamal: 110/115/120 Max crazy,,
[2025-01-03T19:53:20] Smart Repair: mathematically, 29kv should result in 124kmh. On the road it should then be 110-115
[2025-01-03T19:54:10] Yamal: Share some photo man! Gt1!!!
[2025-01-03T19:54:32] Yamal: How you mount huboss xD

[2025-01-03T20:44:03] Finn: Still thinking if that makes sense for dual 22x3 65H. If ill go this route i will do 20s6p 40pl. Completely overkill😂 75150 is too weak sadly

[2025-01-03T22:19:06] Noname: Yours is super fast. What's max watts?
[2025-01-03T22:20:31] Yamal: I think you're overdoing it, a lot of drama for a few times, it's a matter of saving a little and finding a stroke of luck
[2025-01-03T22:20:38] Yamal: 21,,,,,,.
[2025-01-03T22:22:31] Noname: Yeah no tent, scooters got me into debt but YOLO I'll fix that eventually

[2025-01-03T22:25:42] Noname: Made some costly mistakes unfortunately. Mid life crisis hit and wanted some happy memory's. Sitting at coffee shop wasn't enough.

[2025-01-03T22:35:02] Noname: 2 vacations. Christmas week/ 4th July week. I went to Costa Rica for work. Didn't see much but sat outside at night and watched traffic.

[2025-01-03T22:43:35] Noname: Yes, they're around here but rare. Although one was in neighbors yard (chickens) saw one on side of highway and one was next town over in the town center.
[2025-01-03T22:43:55] Noname: More bear/ moose if you go north
[2025-01-03T22:46:27] Yamal: It surprises me how they teach you to defend yourself from a bear attack.
[2025-01-03T22:47:12] Noname: Kick in balls take wallet?
[2025-01-03T22:50:08] Yamal: roll into a ball floor

[2025-01-03T23:13:03] Yamal: We all make mistakes, and we are here, in this world I mean to improve and perfect ourselves, it is normal that many characters clash sometimes, this is something wonderful, you learn a lot from this
[2025-01-03T23:14:05] Yamal: We have not yet been able to contact Benjamin Vedder!!!!!!
[2025-01-03T23:15:06] Yamal: The day he joins this group, a new VESC era will begin.

[2025-01-04T00:17:07] Martin Kaktits: aa guys im lowkey going insane. About awg conversion to metric. Nothing makes sense and the conversion tables are always different on different websites. Even manual mesurement and calculation of area sometimes differ from the charts 😭
[2025-01-04T00:18:41] Martin Kaktits: engineeringtoolbox.com seems like a good source. But it also sayts 4mm^2 is 11awg, while most others say 4mm^2 is 12awg

[2025-01-04T00:22:41] Noname: Oh fine strand and coarse prob. My chart is silicone wire
[2025-01-04T00:26:15] Smart Repair: the list is correct

[2025-01-04T00:27:20] Martin Kaktits: ye
[2025-01-04T00:27:43] Martin Kaktits: awg is such abomination. Why is it used so widely :D
[2025-01-04T00:28:52] Smart Repair: I agree with you... more is less and less is more... total nonsense 🤷‍♂️
[2025-01-04T00:30:04] Martin Kaktits: that would be the least part. But put 2x14awg together, how much awg is it equivalent? 😆only god knows. Put 2x2mm^2 together - its equivalent to 4mm^2 😄
[2025-01-04T00:34:15] Martin Kaktits: acording to chart 2x14awg is 11awg 🤣👍
[2025-01-04T00:52:20] Rose: Hey there intensivecarebear, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2025-01-04T10:34:05] 'lekrsu': Phases will by the nature of our use never be a sustained load on all wires ^^'

[2025-01-04T13:32:35] Smart Repair: If the front wheel is at its maximum speed, then a negative current flow should be visible in the log. However, this is not the case

[2025-01-04T18:44:39] Yamal: What,,?
[2025-01-04T18:45:20] Andrei Albert: 270A phase
[2025-01-04T18:45:32] Yamal: Little only
[2025-01-04T18:45:45] Yamal: You can push 350 or 400?
[2025-01-04T18:46:39] Yamal: 400.. and 200a battery
[2025-01-04T18:46:50] Yamal: So far from your limit,,?
[2025-01-04T18:46:53] Marius: what motor?
[2025-01-04T18:58:05] Andrei Albert: @SibClimb whats max i can push?😁
[2025-01-04T18:58:09] Andrei Albert: 80h
[2025-01-04T18:58:17] Andrei Albert: Still a beast
[2025-01-04T19:00:20] Yamal: beast mode performance it’s my sad group of telegram xD
[2025-01-04T19:18:28] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Uncontrollabl
[2025-01-04T19:29:36] NetworkDir: GND from controller connected to NRF ?
[2025-01-04T19:29:46] 'lekrsu': Yes, of course.
[2025-01-04T19:30:04] 'lekrsu': 3.3v from comms port, gnd from nrf port, rx tx from nrf port
[2025-01-04T19:30:47] 'lekrsu': Tried rx/tx on port 11/9 vice versa
[2025-01-04T19:33:00] Yamal: <voice_message>
[2025-01-04T19:45:46] 'lekrsu': Thought that what was I flashed
[2025-01-04T19:49:42] 'lekrsu': I'll checksum them I guess
[2025-01-04T19:52:09] 'lekrsu': They're.. not identical
[2025-01-04T20:00:22] 'lekrsu': It's identical to the 6 year old commit
[2025-01-04T20:33:01] Face de Pin Sucé: CL350, normally 350A, but @NetworkDir seemed to have pushed up to 400A phase on CL
[2025-01-04T20:33:59] Andrei Albert: And fw?
[2025-01-04T20:38:38] Face de Pin Sucé: Can try up to 150A to see how it goes, don't forget to make some logs and tune right the motor
[2025-01-04T20:41:06] Yamal: But with 33/2 for what fw ..?
[2025-01-04T20:43:15] Yamal: 24s..
[2025-01-04T20:43:16] Andrei Albert: Just curious
[2025-01-04T20:44:24] NetworkDir: Yeah we try with 400 phase and +100A fwk but controller +70C
[2025-01-04T20:44:43] NetworkDir: 350A phase fine
[2025-01-04T20:45:01] Yamal: It would be nice if you found your top speed without fw t after starting to weaken the field, or start playing with the battery and phase A's...
[2025-01-04T20:45:45] Yamal: highway and leather jumpsuit xD
[2025-01-04T20:46:55] Andrei Albert: Clearlyyyyu
[2025-01-04T20:47:00] Andrei Albert: Today 130
[2025-01-04T20:47:04] Andrei Albert: But too cold
[2025-01-04T20:47:15] Andrei Albert: Also my front tire done
[2025-01-04T20:48:06] Yamal: 🪩
[2025-01-04T20:51:00] Face de Pin Sucé: Of course x)
[2025-01-04T20:51:56] Yamal: Hyper trottinet
[2025-01-04T20:55:55] GABE: @Bradhaku I can't do this 🤣

[2025-01-04T21:00:05] Yamal: ⚡️
[2025-01-04T21:00:24] Yamal: 🎩
[2025-01-04T21:00:38] Yamal: 💪
[2025-01-04T21:00:38] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-04T23:15:53] Andrei Albert: 😂
[2025-01-04T23:16:33] Pandalgns: guys, more or less how many phase amps can i handle with 100 battery amps¿?
[2025-01-04T23:18:52] Yamal: Really look very nice 👍
[2025-01-04T23:20:02] Yamal: you wear the kit the soken for him axis
[2025-01-04T23:22:17] Andrei Albert: What
[2025-01-04T23:22:41] Pandalgns: and another question... how many poles have a 22x3 60h motor?? anyone know?
[2025-01-04T23:24:34] Yamal: 30
[2025-01-04T23:25:45] Pandalgns: ok is for motor setup
[2025-01-04T23:25:48] Pandalgns: thx bro

[2025-01-04T23:27:34] Yamal: Ready to g0,,?
[2025-01-04T23:27:42] Pandalgns: nope xD
[2025-01-04T23:27:50] Yamal: :/
[2025-01-04T23:27:54] Pandalgns: im testing motors with new wiring
[2025-01-04T23:27:56] Pandalgns: xDD
[2025-01-04T23:28:51] 'lekrsu': You can always count by shorting two phases without a controller connected. Count the stutters in a complete rotation by hand.
[2025-01-04T23:30:35] Pandalgns: but I'm not really testing, I'm putting 60v 100 amps of battery to test that the motors are well wired but it will go with 72v 450 amps of battery
[2025-01-04T23:31:18] Yamal: Halo 🚀
[2025-01-04T23:35:36] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_20633@04-01-2025_23-35-36.jpg>

[2025-01-05T11:46:03] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Sounds like names from the Talmud
[2025-01-05T11:46:28] Pandalgns: What is Talmud?? 🧐
[2025-01-05T11:46:51] Yamal: I have already written him the letter worth more than €3000, hopefully...
[2025-01-05T11:47:34] Pandalgns: More or less like a bible but Jewish?
[2025-01-05T11:47:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Something very important to us (that shouldn't have the word fuck attached to it)
[2025-01-05T11:48:37] Pandalgns: Sorry brother, I just did some research on the Internet and I see that it is something important to you 😅😅😅
[2025-01-05T11:49:13] Pandalgns: Corrected, now without fucking around 😅 sorry

[2025-01-05T11:50:54] Pandalgns: Yes
[2025-01-05T11:52:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: You might be Jewish
[2025-01-05T11:53:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Because in the Spanish inquisition time a lot have converted out of fear
[2025-01-05T11:54:35] Pandalgns: They say that Jews are enormous economists and that they know how to control finances very well.... no, I'm not Jewish, no, 😂😂😂
[2025-01-05T11:55:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Maybe I don't also ahaha
[2025-01-05T11:56:03] Pandalgns: 😂😂😂
[2025-01-05T11:56:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I spend a lot more then I earn and everything on escooter and LEDs ahah
[2025-01-05T11:56:49] Pandalgns: Oh my god you're not Jewish you're Spanish!!

[2025-01-05T12:00:33] Pandalgns: Probably like the majority here regardless of our beliefs, races, color, age etc etc... we are different from the world 😂
[2025-01-05T12:02:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: One thing we are in common is spenders
[2025-01-05T12:03:09] Pandalgns: Let's make another group called, bankrupt people 😂😂😂
[2025-01-05T12:05:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The fastest bankrupt people ever 🤣🤣
[2025-01-05T12:06:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Now tbh as a Jew (Israeli Jew) this is the most respectful group I ever took part in
[2025-01-05T12:07:46] Pandalgns: In relation to what?? Racism?? Ungrateful people?? People who don't admit their mistakes?? Homophobic people?? Everything at once??
[2025-01-05T12:10:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Not racism we have something special for us haha it's called antisemitism
[2025-01-05T12:12:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ungeratfull people there is everywhere and mostly it's a misunderstanding between the two sides
[2025-01-05T12:12:50] Pandalgns: What you say could be directly called hatred of Jews?
[2025-01-05T12:21:35] GABE: 👍
[2025-01-05T12:22:10] GABE: Nazi cope
[2025-01-05T12:22:38] GABE: Yeah no racism on our watch :)

[2025-01-05T12:25:48] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Saying we control the world Jews are the cause of all economic problems Nazi stuff in short
[2025-01-05T12:26:35] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: That was a joke that's why I don't feel angry
[2025-01-05T12:33:03] Pandalgns: But what the hell, if you Jews are cool
[2025-01-05T12:35:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Not cool I'm normall what makes me cool is the thunder 2 I'm building and the zero10x I had ahaha
[2025-01-05T12:37:24] Pandalgns: Ur cool 😎

[2025-01-05T13:39:00] Pandalgns: Fuck it, I'm sick and tired of being without a scooter and since I still have a while between finishing the battery and reinforcing the chassis, I'll set it up with what I have and I'll update as I'm sick and tired of being without a scooter.
[2025-01-05T13:42:11] JPPL: Vruuuuum
[2025-01-05T13:42:21] JPPL: Come to Portugal, i borrow you one

[2025-01-05T14:26:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Do we have french that can translate this setup?
[2025-01-05T14:28:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Reinforce that folding system
[2025-01-05T14:31:57] Pandalgns: Better screws
[2025-01-05T14:32:16] Pandalgns: Security locking screw
[2025-01-05T14:32:58] Pandalgns: And when I reinforce the chassis I intend to remove the folding system and weld everything so that it is rigid in one piece, but thanks for the advice brother
[2025-01-05T14:33:25] Andrei Albert: 22s10p, vesc and 75h motors

[2025-01-05T17:06:15] RicharDON: Guys can anyone help me with an Ant BMS?
[2025-01-05T17:06:39] RicharDON: I mounted it but it only shows 29.7v
[2025-01-05T17:35:16] Smart Repair: you should provide a little more information... On Sundays the crystal ball stopped working
[2025-01-05T18:06:38] RicharDON: I don't know how to turn on the BMS
[2025-01-05T18:13:39] Smart Repair: and again, some more information! Nobody knows which BMS you have!? is everything wired correctly!?.... sorry, I don't know what you want to hear. just switch it on
[2025-01-05T18:14:51] RicharDON: <photos/photo_20640@05-01-2025_18-14-51.jpg>
[2025-01-05T18:16:07] RicharDON: I don't know how to turn it on
[2025-01-05T18:42:27] Yamal: MolicAn
[2025-01-05T19:11:18] Noname: Use switch in switch port?
[2025-01-05T21:40:11] GABE: lmfao
[2025-01-05T21:44:06] GABE: Wired wrong, check schematics
[2025-01-05T21:59:13] Noname: Do I have to set up my scooter again if I swap from 16s to 20?
[2025-01-05T22:00:00] Noname: Changing V on settings should only effect range estimates etc?
[2025-01-05T22:06:11] Rose: Hey there Nawfal, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-01-05T22:10:00] pasvik: 84100hp The driver is working properly, but the socket has melted and fused together.
[2025-01-05T22:10:36] pasvik: Ninebot G30 engine
[2025-01-05T22:24:46] 'lekrsu': Can be caused by your soldering, using clone connectors, the controller malfunctioning or going above rated current levels.
[2025-01-05T22:25:50] Smart Repair: I don't know how, but the GT still manages to fuck me dry in the ass every day 😖😮‍💨 Engine 5 days old

[2025-01-05T22:32:44] Yamal: robust engine ^^
[2025-01-05T22:33:30] Yamal: time for a tune-up and make it perfect
[2025-01-05T22:34:00] Smart Repair: and the workmanship is rubbish. An engine must not have holes where dirt and water can get in.
[2025-01-05T22:34:36] Yamal: Look
[2025-01-05T22:35:31] Yamal: <photos/photo_20645@05-01-2025_22-35-31.jpg>
[2025-01-05T22:38:22] Smart Repair: no loonyo or is there?
[2025-01-05T22:39:46] Finn: These motors are for dry use. Why you should drive 120kmh with that wheels at wet weather xD
[2025-01-05T22:40:35] Yamal: that's lonyo f1
[2025-01-05T22:42:08] Paolo ⁭: These motors are not waterproof, so I don't see the problem
[2025-01-05T22:42:26] Paolo ⁭: User can mod it and turn waterproof, but never will be 100% waterproof
[2025-01-05T22:42:40] Paolo ⁭: We always suggest to don't use in wet conditions
[2025-01-05T22:43:31] Smart Repair: in dry weather dirt gets in too... and you can drive 30kmh. They should have just used silicone or a seal. it's just rubbish if you drill an 8mm hole in the engine with a 4mm cable in it. an engine must not be left open, whether it's dry or not
[2025-01-05T22:43:55] cihan: Finally I've got a question about motor. I would like to decide how many series cells I need so I need to know Kv of the motor. It's navee n65. Can I turn the scooter upside down and run the throttle with full power and measure voltage on one of the phase wires? Then I can calculate turns and divide it to the voltage I measured?
[2025-01-05T22:45:00] Finn: They are not waterproof so dont complain about water and dirt to get inside. They dont have an ip rating😂
[2025-01-05T22:46:22] Smart Repair: 🤦🏼
[2025-01-05T22:50:18] Finn: what do you expect??
[2025-01-05T22:50:35] Finn: waterproof it yourself lol
[2025-01-05T22:51:26] 'lekrsu': Til, Lonnyo has exposed holes.
[2025-01-05T22:53:15] Marius: why is bro responding to a post that is 2.5+ years old
[2025-01-05T22:53:32] Smart Repair: a stone fits through the hole... respect
[2025-01-05T22:53:51] Finn: Then you should have looked for that hole
[2025-01-05T22:54:05] Finn: isnt a stone size hole obvious to spot?
[2025-01-05T22:55:31] Yamal: what a motoraco those

[2025-01-06T11:36:09] Yamal: New VESC
[2025-01-06T11:36:50] Yamal: I didn't know it existed, only Thor 300
[2025-01-06T11:37:21] Yamal: 18fet
[2025-01-06T11:38:40] Yamal: Tolt 😱 December 2023: A big problem in the community - folks want to build Higher Voltage builds, but there are no suitable ESCs available.. A few months later, an e-scooter/ e-bike controller emerges that people start using for HV builds. Great controller! However, it's big, bulky, doesnt fit most connectors/ enclosures. No dedicated footpad connector/ hall sensor ports dont match, no direct LED support, etc... Early 2024: I get on a call with our internal design team. Here's how the call goes: Me- We want a a controller capable of 32S/ 135V, and upto 400 amps abs. max. A DEDICATED Funwheel/ VESC-wheel controller. Designer - Sure that can be done. Me- ...and we want it in the same space and same bolt pattern and layout as the Thor300. Designer-..that...might be impossible... Well, that's how it began, a lot of impossible things later, the Thor400-32S was born. Here are some mind blowing specs: True 32S controller (with all HV components rated to 150V! perhaps the only one in the industry...perhaps). Extremely expensive and reliable OnSemi Dual cool Automotive Tech FETs. We have 18 of these FETs in this extremely small package. Providing unrivaled power with TOLT/ Dual cool technology. Forget overheating controllers. 400A abs. max current (depending on cooling/ Fungineers box is recommended). Same bolting pattern and size as the Thor300. Fits in the Fungineers box and still has space for 2S2P 21700 (400A in this package is unheard of!). Same onboard LED support as the Thor300 (just plug in the status, front, and rear led). Choice to run 5V or 12V LEDs (can be switched with a jumper!) ESP32 breakout pins to run additional functions. 12V/ 5V additional pads to run 5A (max with cooling) LEDs or other functions! Sin/Cos encoder Support. Additional temperature probe support (to monitor temperature of your split pack). ebike throttle support (Can be switched with a jumper). Roll to start: Currently in beta. Improved robustness and design - stronger, and more rigid than ever. Momentary button: Same button and pins as the Thor300, but improved hardware and logic. VESC Express onboard Bluetooth/ Wifi module; preconfigured. XT90 connector. In short, the Thor400 is NOT for Onewheels/ Funwheels. This is an ebike/ EUC worthy Controller that will turn your Funwheel into an absolute beast; and you can be sure your Funwheel is 100% future proof with the Thor400 due to the bleeding edge features.

[2025-01-06T12:41:36] JPPL: Its amazing how onewheel setups evolved along the years, helping escooter plataform to evolve further now, last year we got a lot of development! 🥳
[2025-01-06T13:41:28] Yamal: you are loaded with scooter with vesc xD
[2025-01-06T13:42:09] Yamal: It's great to be able to try different brands of vesc controller, it's ideal👍

[2025-01-06T14:42:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Not for off road
[2025-01-06T15:00:36] Matte: conformal coating and drowning all connectors in silicone

[2025-01-06T15:07:35] Maximus Brokus: Just got this piece of shit yesterday
[2025-01-06T15:07:37] Maximus Brokus: Its broken
[2025-01-06T15:07:52] Maximus Brokus: But has working motor, I dont need anything more :D
[2025-01-06T15:08:14] Maximus Brokus: Also its straight up china trash

[2025-01-06T17:38:02] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 12v 5A from 150v on this size.... Seem not true Not any Cooper busbar claim for 400 abs, hum I don't know this package but it seem very weak
[2025-01-06T17:46:20] JPPL: Yes, it seems not to handle what it claims, lets try to test it One day, Will wait for MOSFETs discord awnser
[2025-01-06T18:40:06] Pandalgns: Guys, a question, seeing that there is a way to make some displays of other scooters compatible with Vesc, like the Xiaomi display and I think the Nami or Kabbo one, I think it could also be done, do you know if there is a way to make a QS S4 display compatible? Programming lispbm or doing something else
[2025-01-06T19:03:50] Pandalgns: I never saw it but I was told at the time, I don't know who it was, that it could be compatible, so you say that the QSS4 could be compatible with Vesc?
[2025-01-06T19:40:22] Pandalgns: Thanks brother, I'm looking at the github to make it compatible, it's interesting because it has connection diagrams for the mks 84100hp and 84200hp, which are the ones I use, I'm going to investigate well to see if I can do it, thank you so much
[2025-01-06T19:41:17] Pandalgns: <video_file>
[2025-01-06T19:41:37] Pandalgns: For now the rear motor was wired well 😂
[2025-01-06T19:42:44] Mirono escooters: Shunts higher then MOSFETs?
[2025-01-06T19:42:47] Mirono escooters: Or just looks like it
[2025-01-06T19:43:05] Pandalgns: In one of the tests in the air the rear motor has reached more than 6000w 😂😂
[2025-01-06T19:52:41] JPPL: I Will check later on flat

[2025-01-06T22:33:34] Matte: Oh nice, trying to find a broken scooter myself to take the motors. Can only find xiaomi crap tho
[2025-01-06T23:13:14] Maximus Brokus: This is 50cc scooter
[2025-01-06T23:13:58] Matte: yuck
[2025-01-06T23:14:07] Maximus Brokus: But electric conversion
[2025-01-06T23:14:15] Maximus Brokus: Or smth
[2025-01-06T23:14:23] Maximus Brokus: Was cheap
[2025-01-06T23:15:49] Maximus Brokus: Some china scooter
[2025-01-06T23:16:21] Noname: Omg the handlebars 😆
[2025-01-06T23:17:31] Noname: Worst part about elec moped is the suspension sucks. I want a broken gas one for conversion
[2025-01-06T23:17:45] Maximus Brokus: Suspension felt right
[2025-01-06T23:17:57] Noname: Mine sucks
[2025-01-06T23:18:18] Noname: Price for that beauty?
[2025-01-06T23:18:22] Maximus Brokus: 150€
[2025-01-06T23:19:01] Maximus Brokus: But without working controller or batt
[2025-01-06T23:20:59] Noname: Stock Junk anyway
[2025-01-06T23:21:19] Maximus Brokus: Yeah, but it should fit some range
[2025-01-06T23:21:40] Maximus Brokus: Proably doesnt need much power
[2025-01-06T23:21:50] Maximus Brokus: Just build a bomb from few used e-scooter bats
[2025-01-06T23:22:29] Noname: Mine stock was 43a lol
[2025-01-06T23:22:35] Noname: 60v 35ah
[2025-01-06T23:22:40] Maximus Brokus: The sticker is washed out
[2025-01-06T23:22:47] Maximus Brokus: But I think its a 50A controller
[2025-01-06T23:23:03] Maximus Brokus: But just 48v 33ah lead bat
[2025-01-06T23:23:08] Maximus Brokus: Dunno if they even working
[2025-01-06T23:23:09] Noname: Off
[2025-01-06T23:23:22] Noname: Thats a slow ass scoot
[2025-01-06T23:23:26] Maximus Brokus: Yeah
[2025-01-06T23:23:52] Matte: ebike/emoped controllers usually state continuous amps, it doesnt mean its 50A phase amps
[2025-01-06T23:24:00] Maximus Brokus: Yeah
[2025-01-06T23:24:10] Matte: but it also could be 50A phase amps because shitty controller lol
[2025-01-06T23:24:15] Maximus Brokus: I think it means something like 50ampsish from batt
[2025-01-06T23:24:28] Maximus Brokus: Propably maybe half
[2025-01-06T23:26:04] Noname: Well even with a Vesc the motors have little torque. 4x battery and Mines ok but nothing exciting
[2025-01-06T23:26:14] Maximus Brokus: Im not sure
[2025-01-06T23:26:23] Maximus Brokus: But the wires are pretty thin too
[2025-01-06T23:26:29] Maximus Brokus: w8
[2025-01-06T23:26:44] Maximus Brokus: <photos/photo_20662@06-01-2025_23-26-44.jpg>
[2025-01-06T23:26:54] Maximus Brokus: Cheap ass chinese phase wires
[2025-01-06T23:26:54] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Maximus has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-06T23:27:09] Matte: people thing VESC causes low torque but its because of what i mentioned few minutes ago, VESC states phase amps, other controllers continuous battery amps
[2025-01-06T23:28:03] Matte: not unusual for a 50A ebike controller to give 200 phase amps
[2025-01-06T23:29:26] Maximus Brokus: The original hardware is shitt anyways in this shitbox
[2025-01-06T23:30:04] Matte: i was kinda replying to NoName with that message
[2025-01-06T23:30:13] Maximus Brokus: Oh sry
[2025-01-06T23:30:24] Matte: but i believe original hardware in that scooter is half garbage
[2025-01-06T23:30:32] Maximus Brokus: I thought you think, I try to make a rocket from this shitbox
[2025-01-06T23:31:16] Matte: Nah, that shitbox is born to have lifepo4 bricks in it
[2025-01-06T23:31:22] Maximus Brokus: Im happy if it doesnt brake, also thinking about voltage. Not sure if I benefit from 72v if I dont need it
[2025-01-06T23:31:31] Noname: https://youtu.be/T_o7NaIugUw?feature=shared
[2025-01-06T23:32:43] Noname: Is phase amps the same at different voltage?
[2025-01-06T23:33:00] Maximus Brokus: Basically yes
[2025-01-06T23:33:05] Maximus Brokus: Long answer no
[2025-01-06T23:33:24] Matte: the question isnt precise enough so the answer Maximus gave is correct lol
[2025-01-06T23:35:15] Noname: 200 phase amps are roughly the same torque it just uses less battery amps with higher voltage
[2025-01-06T23:36:07] Maximus Brokus: This should be correct
[2025-01-06T23:36:11] Noname: Because starting speed is low voltage high amps. And switches when speed increses
[2025-01-06T23:36:12] Maximus Brokus: *not an expert
[2025-01-06T23:36:27] Maximus Brokus: There are some real world valuables
[2025-01-06T23:36:38] Noname: Basic theory
[2025-01-06T23:37:08] Maximus Brokus: On Paper it should be near identical with identical bats
[2025-01-06T23:37:48] Noname: If your swapping lead for li ion sure
[2025-01-06T23:38:18] Maximus Brokus: The only question that remains for me is the voltage im going to pick
[2025-01-06T23:38:30] Maximus Brokus: I dont think its that good to make it that fast
[2025-01-06T23:38:39] Maximus Brokus: Maybe just stay at it with 13S bat
[2025-01-06T23:40:36] Noname: https://www.tradeindia.com/products/plain-black-electric-scooter-165626.html
[2025-01-06T23:40:50] Noname: What the he'll is max climbing capacity 20a
[2025-01-06T23:41:53] Noname: Think that was also a gas scooter. If it has a long ass swingarm it's a conversion. Bought a honda big ruckus ps250 conversion for a friend it looks funny with a 3 foot swingarm
[2025-01-06T23:44:01] Maximus Brokus: Thats what the seller told me too
[2025-01-06T23:44:47] Matte: if your motor has hall sensors https://vi.aliexpress.com/item/1005006293672713.html
[2025-01-06T23:44:59] Maximus Brokus: wtf
[2025-01-06T23:45:03] Maximus Brokus: Why should I buy this?
[2025-01-06T23:45:13] Maximus Brokus: 250A ubox
[2025-01-06T23:45:18] Maximus Brokus: Happy life
[2025-01-06T23:46:03] Matte: ubox is twice the price, probably more, isnt this a shitbox?
[2025-01-06T23:46:10] Maximus Brokus: Yes
[2025-01-06T23:46:19] Maximus Brokus: But if shitbox breaks I still have a good ubox
[2025-01-06T23:46:59] Matte: suit yourself
[2025-01-06T23:47:10] Maximus Brokus: Tbh
[2025-01-06T23:47:26] Maximus Brokus: I dont see any reason into buying some controller I can barely set any parameters
[2025-01-06T23:47:40] Maximus Brokus: Gives more headache than needed
[2025-01-06T23:48:24] Maximus Brokus: I also figured that vesc is very efficient, which would be very usefull if I can fit the desired 4kwh battery inside
[2025-01-06T23:49:30] Finn: Put in g30 controller with vesc😂
[2025-01-06T23:50:30] Maximus Brokus: Would be very funny
[2025-01-06T23:50:35] Maximus Brokus: Cant beat g30
[2025-01-06T23:50:48] Maximus Brokus: But I dont want to go the headache route here
[2025-01-06T23:54:42] Maximus Brokus: I think I know what im going for, just not sure about the voltage, the seller said "Its a very trouqy motor" maybe it has low kv and thats the reason its 48v, that would be much fun
[2025-01-06T23:54:51] Maximus Brokus: But also a reason to go 72v
[2025-01-06T23:54:51] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Maximus has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-06T23:55:31] 'lekrsu': You accelerate with wattage in the end.
[2025-01-06T23:55:49] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2025-01-07T00:03:31] Maximus Brokus: If it is low kv I dont see a reason to pump it with a lot of energy
[2025-01-07T00:10:48] Noname: Depends on layout too. I pushed the limits to what I could fit by mm's
[2025-01-07T00:11:01] Maximus Brokus: Which could heat up your motor and controller more as well
[2025-01-07T00:11:31] Noname: Moped are very different
[2025-01-07T00:11:44] Noname: Motors don't get hot like scooters. Lots of mass
[2025-01-07T00:11:51] Maximus Brokus: Layout no problem, I would go with less capacity too if neccessary, you can charge pretty quick almost all cells with at least 1c
[2025-01-07T00:12:52] Noname: Less capacity? We can't be moped friends
[2025-01-07T00:13:11] Maximus Brokus: Lets say I can do 200km range at least
[2025-01-07T00:13:18] Maximus Brokus: I can recharge that in under 1 hour
[2025-01-07T00:13:34] Noname: 120mi? Lol good luck
[2025-01-07T00:13:55] Noname: I need 100wh per mile or 1.6km
[2025-01-07T00:14:09] Maximus Brokus: 100wh?!
[2025-01-07T00:14:14] Maximus Brokus: With going fast?
[2025-01-07T00:14:29] Noname: 35mph
[2025-01-07T00:14:36] Maximus Brokus: How many smart units?
[2025-01-07T00:14:44] Noname: What
[2025-01-07T00:14:58] Maximus Brokus: ~56 smart units
[2025-01-07T00:15:14] Maximus Brokus: My mopeds legal speed is 25kph
[2025-01-07T00:15:24] Noname: Damn kmh
[2025-01-07T00:15:39] Noname: 27mph for me
[2025-01-07T00:15:52] Noname: I do 42 max 😆
[2025-01-07T00:16:17] Noname: What's a smart unit though
[2025-01-07T00:16:22] Maximus Brokus: I think like 30kph will be good enough to not be spotted from outside
[2025-01-07T00:16:32] Maximus Brokus: Metric units
[2025-01-07T00:17:22] Noname: ÷ 1.6 for smart units
[2025-01-07T00:17:50] Maximus Brokus: Im not asian bro 💀
[2025-01-07T00:18:06] Noname: Russian?
[2025-01-07T00:19:49] Matte: He does look slavic but dont think he looks russian
[2025-01-07T00:20:03] Matte: Polish maybe?
[2025-01-07T00:20:08] Noname: Hey now
[2025-01-07T00:20:24] Maximus Brokus: <photos/photo_20663@07-01-2025_00-20-24.jpg>
[2025-01-07T00:20:31] Maximus Brokus: Keep guessing
[2025-01-07T00:20:32] Maximus Brokus: :D
[2025-01-07T00:20:44] Matte: maybe more north than poland
[2025-01-07T00:20:49] Maximus Brokus: Close
[2025-01-07T00:20:53] Maximus Brokus: Germany
[2025-01-07T00:21:15] Noname: Germans can't do math?
[2025-01-07T00:21:38] Maximus Brokus: I dont think it suits my efficiency
[2025-01-07T00:21:44] Maximus Brokus: Also I drank some beer
[2025-01-07T00:21:51] Matte: you look like a polish football hooligan here
[2025-01-07T00:22:13] Maximus Brokus: Maybe its the piercing :D
[2025-01-07T00:22:18] Maximus Brokus: I removed that
[2025-01-07T00:22:24] Maximus Brokus: People got pretty violent
[2025-01-07T00:22:34] Maximus Brokus: That piercing is a health hazard
[2025-01-07T00:23:09] Matte: dont think it suits you anyways
[2025-01-07T00:23:20] Maximus Brokus: I really liked to play with it :D
[2025-01-07T00:24:06] Maximus Brokus: Still have a small ear pearcing to play around, not that much of a safety hazard
[2025-01-07T00:24:30] Maximus Brokus: Once a dude punched me and that eye piercing was bleeding a lot
[2025-01-07T00:25:18] Marius: why did you let him punch you
[2025-01-07T00:25:41] Maximus Brokus: Mentally ill people, not predictable
[2025-01-07T00:25:53] Marius: you always need to be prepared
[2025-01-07T00:26:22] Matte: oh yeah live life 24/7 prepared for someone to punch you. be real dude
[2025-01-07T00:28:14] Maximus Brokus: Believe it or not, it happend when I expected it the least

[2025-01-07T13:52:41] Maximus Brokus: Ah dang
[2025-01-07T13:52:47] Maximus Brokus: Looks like you got solder balls
[2025-01-07T13:52:47] Arnau Martinez Casals: Burned on 50a battery 130 phase with 20s battery 🫠🙃, not cooling issues

[2025-01-07T13:58:10] Smart Repair: 100/100 has shit Fets installed. I've already killed 2 of them. If you have the space, I'd rather go for 240/250
[2025-01-07T13:58:27] Marius: 🔥🔥
[2025-01-07T13:58:35] Arnau Martinez Casals: Now installing the 150a ones
[2025-01-07T14:00:43] Smart Repair: ok... then 100A battery and 180a phase with good cooling. I also drove the 150 for a long time with peak 11kW
[2025-01-07T14:58:55] Yamal: No use hall?
[2025-01-07T16:16:30] Yamal: ^^'
[2025-01-07T16:17:49] JPPL: Lets start building
[2025-01-07T16:30:10] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Anyone noticed in the VESC Express code that there is a new device mentioned?
[2025-01-07T16:32:04] Matte: What kind of phase amps do these smaller motors take?
[2025-01-07T16:35:31] Yamal: Yeah! but it's going to take me many months to be able to buy everything, it is what it is, good things come to wait...
[2025-01-07T16:37:39] Yamal: The good thing is that I am not going to invent anything new, it will be the closest thing to a thunder RFP xD
[2025-01-07T16:40:10] Maximus Brokus: <photos/photo_20680@07-01-2025_16-40-10.jpg>
[2025-01-07T16:40:19] Maximus Brokus: 103Nm doesnt sound bad
[2025-01-07T16:40:47] Maximus Brokus: Also good they included a wiring diagram
[2025-01-07T16:43:23] Maximus Brokus: But not sure what they mean by under pressure
[2025-01-07T16:43:43] Maximus Brokus: This vehicle doesnt have to build up oilpressure
[2025-01-07T16:43:43] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Maximus has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-07T16:45:43] Yamal: .
[2025-01-07T16:45:57] Maximus Brokus: F you :)
[2025-01-07T16:53:32] Maximus Brokus: More than a maxed out g30
[2025-01-07T17:07:50] Noname: Spring return throttle?
[2025-01-07T17:08:11] Maximus Brokus: Yes
[2025-01-07T17:21:21] Pandalgns: <video_file>
[2025-01-07T17:21:28] Pandalgns: I'm afraid to try this
[2025-01-07T17:21:42] Pandalgns: Will it work? Or everything will burn
[2025-01-07T17:25:33] Pandalgns: <video_file>
[2025-01-07T17:25:50] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Pandalgns has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-07T17:28:23] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Digging bit more into the code and figured out there will be some new Vesc Express called Express Plus. Device looks to be a display with 2 buttons and a resolution of 240x240 pixels> Screen similar like image
[2025-01-07T17:28:47] Pandalgns: In principle everything seems correct, the lispbm programming is missing and check that everything is well connected and working correctly
[2025-01-07T17:29:19] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): No .... its explicit called Express Plus in the commit of 2 weeks ago.
[2025-01-07T17:29:59] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): https://github.com/vedderb/vesc_express/blob/main/main/hwconf/vesc/express_plus/hw_express_plus.c
[2025-01-07T17:33:32] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Well likewise it's a new version of Vdisp thats for sure but based on what i can find doesnt have SD card. So again a pure just "Display" would be nice if it had SD card and GPS but nothing refers to it in the code (yet)
[2025-01-07T17:37:37] Maximus Brokus: i2c
[2025-01-07T17:37:50] Maximus Brokus: Or can
[2025-01-07T17:46:24] Tortilla Végh: Someone implemented that thing into vesc lisp?
[2025-01-07T17:47:06] Yamal: <photos/photo_20683@07-01-2025_17-47-06.jpg>
[2025-01-07T17:50:42] Pandalgns: From what I understand, ak's lisp code is valid for the qss4 screen as well.
[2025-01-07T17:52:14] Maximus Brokus: Btw
[2025-01-07T17:52:47] Maximus Brokus: Can I connect to ubox with my android using otg cable?
[2025-01-07T18:01:16] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): RP2040 FTW :) But yeah try to convice Vedder for that ......
[2025-01-07T18:07:41] Noname: I think that's what they mean by throttle under pressure
[2025-01-07T19:13:37] 'lekrsu': No
[2025-01-07T19:45:50] Andrei Albert: New tire innn

[2025-01-07T20:21:37] Pandalgns: not bad
[2025-01-07T20:33:49] Yamal: Only 1 motor ?
[2025-01-07T20:36:07] Pandalgns: For the moment yes
[2025-01-07T20:36:55] Pandalgns: I am testing the adaptation of the qss4 display to the vesc, the profiles, trying to enter the hidden mode of the profiles (which I have not been able to) but so far so good
[2025-01-07T20:38:07] Pandalgns: I have tried changing the code to enter hidden mode, the pulse command and turning on lights, but I have not been able to
[2025-01-07T20:38:38] Pandalgns: Can you help me James?
[2025-01-07T20:46:05] Pandalgns: And should the code start at gear 1?
[2025-01-07T21:33:56] Jason: nop
[2025-01-07T21:34:15] Jason: the limit of how vesctool access usb doesn't allow
[2025-01-07T21:34:19] Jason: fuck qt

[2025-01-07T23:01:18] Yamal: If I had money, I would buy this scooter for Haku Rider
[2025-01-07T23:06:46] Jan: Whats stopping you from having money?
[2025-01-07T23:11:26] Yamal: What I mean is that if I had a lot of money XD
[2025-01-07T23:12:23] Yamal: Hobbit Land?
[2025-01-07T23:12:40] Yamal: 🫰🤙
[2025-01-07T23:12:55] Andrei Albert: Smoked a bmw 540i tonight
[2025-01-07T23:13:04] Andrei Albert: 3/3 runs smoked ahahahaa
[2025-01-07T23:13:58] Andrei Albert: Still not a top speed yet
[2025-01-07T23:16:37] Jan: Lets say you instantly get 10k, what would you do?
[2025-01-07T23:19:33] Yamal: I would go to Singapore to meet my family
[2025-01-07T23:20:49] Noname: Hookers and Cocaine?
[2025-01-07T23:32:33] Jan: Thats kinda of the mindset that never gets you out of it. With 10k, do some smart investing and take some risks. Low risk ETF at 7% makes you 4k in 4 years. Then you would already have made 4k out of nothing
[2025-01-07T23:32:44] Jan: And you still got the 10k
[2025-01-07T23:33:25] Jan: The moment we get money we have to hold back on spending it and rather make emotionless plans on how to slowly accumulate wealth
[2025-01-07T23:34:31] Jan: It snowballs so hard, the more you have the more you make. But if you never start, zero you make
[2025-01-07T23:36:16] Mirono escooters: I'd invest it in my portfolio
[2025-01-07T23:36:24] Mirono escooters: Maybe 1k for something nice xd
[2025-01-07T23:36:38] Mirono escooters: Inflation a bich
[2025-01-07T23:37:48] Jan: This
[2025-01-07T23:38:05] Jan: Inflation and Taxes fucks everyone up
[2025-01-07T23:38:20] Jan: You can legally evade inflation
[2025-01-07T23:38:20] Mirono escooters: 4.4% in Belgium So a etf barely rewards you
[2025-01-07T23:38:30] Jan: You can move to a low tax region
[2025-01-07T23:38:42] Jan: Depends on the etf
[2025-01-07T23:38:52] Mirono escooters: What a joke. We have a proper economy and are second worst inflation in Europa I hate big guys who have millions in bank making decisions for us
[2025-01-07T23:39:03] Mirono escooters: Yeah but you understand what I mean🫂
[2025-01-07T23:39:11] Jan: I would choose something people have very needs right now. Computing Technology Power
[2025-01-07T23:39:25] Mirono escooters: Yep I'm all in technology
[2025-01-07T23:39:43] Mirono escooters: But let's say people don't care. Just choose worldwide ETF I see on FB all the time
[2025-01-07T23:39:54] Mirono escooters: 🤷 they just protect against inflation. Don't win anything
[2025-01-07T23:40:14] Jan: S&P500 is just your american inflation index 😅
[2025-01-07T23:41:18] Smart Repair: Can anyone tell me the dimensions of the MT5 brake caliper?
[2025-01-07T23:41:20] Jan: People dont care about how our current money system works. If you understand it, you will know what to do not to get rekt
[2025-01-07T23:41:23] Mirono escooters: As long as they keep printing.. I've just realised we are totally offtopic
[2025-01-07T23:42:01] Jan: If you read that, you will understand
[2025-01-07T23:42:08] Jan: True
[2025-01-07T23:42:32] Jan: Buy more vesc's with the money you made from investing 😬
[2025-01-07T23:56:42] Marius: is this the original version? or is english the translation
[2025-01-07T23:57:57] Jan: Its english originally
[2025-01-08T01:33:53] Matte: very cool but strange to own a scooter you cant lift over your head
[2025-01-08T01:39:38] Rose: Hey there Mario, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-01-08T02:05:18] Noname: Ah no, Unless your in EU or have ridiculous laws

[2025-01-08T09:01:46] Yamal: @Un_Jason I want to ask you something
[2025-01-08T09:03:19] Yamal: I don't understand the weped videos, why they move to areas where there are cars, put the scooter inside the car, move to another point with the car, leave it, take the scooter back to another point where there is another car, etc.
[2025-01-08T09:04:36] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Ever tried parking in South Korea near the place you want to go ...... Been there a few times (for business) and next visit i want finally to go to Weped and make a blast on one.
[2025-01-08T09:05:39] Yamal: Never go Korea man
[2025-01-08T09:06:58] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Why not ... great country ... everything mega clean, nice people chicks, nice food and tons of investment opportunities there. (Lotte is a mega investor in Seoul for example)
[2025-01-08T09:09:34] Pandalgns: Yamal: player 456 😂😂
[2025-01-08T09:16:02] Yamal: I mean I haven't gone, because I haven't had the chance to go yet.
[2025-01-08T09:16:18] Yamal: Why? 🫰😂
[2025-01-08T09:17:38] Pandalgns: 😂😂😂
[2025-01-08T09:18:01] Pandalgns: You would be a millionaire, think about it 😂
[2025-01-08T09:19:04] Yamal: 🧐
[2025-01-08T09:34:20] Jason: they are drivers for usually like drunk peoples and they use scooters to move to customers
[2025-01-08T09:34:33] Jason: fucked up education 😅
[2025-01-08T09:37:18] Yamal: XD
[2025-01-08T09:37:26] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): In that regards i cant say .. the people i work with are very skilled but that might be due the sector i work in. The clients i meet are mega friendly and not to forget the places i come are superb :)
[2025-01-08T09:37:48] Jason: yeah
[2025-01-08T09:38:01] Jason: those in seoul
[2025-01-08T09:38:07] Jason: tbh most
[2025-01-08T09:38:28] Yamal: Also kimchi nice
[2025-01-08T09:38:29] Jason: go to academy and study things before school teaches them and they have to do that so they get good grades
[2025-01-08T09:38:38] Jason: too long to explain anhway
[2025-01-08T09:39:41] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Kimchi = just sauerkraut + spices + radish
[2025-01-08T09:39:50] Jason: yeah
[2025-01-08T09:39:53] Jason: exactly
[2025-01-08T09:40:03] Jason: basic is same

[2025-01-08T09:45:57] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Also trying to recall at least there was some kimchi in it :)
[2025-01-08T09:46:12] Jason: is it chicken
[2025-01-08T09:46:16] Jason: or seafood
[2025-01-08T09:46:27] Jason: 😅
[2025-01-08T09:47:34] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Well i aint eating Seafood so surely it's chicken
[2025-01-08T09:48:20] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): View towards North Korea on 486m height
[2025-01-08T09:50:05] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): It was big fun cruising trough Seoul with Free scooters :)
[2025-01-08T10:03:19] Jason: lol
[2025-01-08T10:03:38] Jason: now the swing snsc is now in my city
[2025-01-08T10:03:59] Jason: swing stopped scooter business on seoul now only ebikes

[2025-01-08T12:18:22] Jason: well FUCK
[2025-01-08T12:20:54] Pandalgns: Spaghetti!!!!😜😜
[2025-01-08T12:21:07] Face de Pin Sucé: Pretty nice this one, who's making this ? 😁
[2025-01-08T12:25:35] Face de Pin Sucé: It is in spanish, but nothing interesting to be honest x) "Fastest in spain"
[2025-01-08T12:26:23] Andrei Albert: Do you agree with that?😆
[2025-01-08T12:28:53] Face de Pin Sucé: It has nothing close to fastest x)
[2025-01-08T12:29:14] Face de Pin Sucé: Basic configuration 22S10P with G300 and 75H 160Kmh I guess
[2025-01-08T12:30:00] Andrei Albert: Fast but no fastest
[2025-01-08T12:39:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Aahah I'm so dumb
[2025-01-08T12:40:25] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Not basic compare to my slow ass setup (60h 72/36 8c 140 continues 75200pro V2)
[2025-01-08T12:40:49] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: We all know who is the fastest @SibClimb 😉
[2025-01-08T12:42:47] Yamal: That thing about the fastest in Spain had to be seen, real data on the vehicles is needed, otherwise the word doesn't count.
[2025-01-08T13:30:47] Pandalgns: It is very easy to say I have this preparation and I am the fastest of.... everything is to prove it, yesterday with my halo doing tests in the air, stock engines 3000w 22x3 60h, mks 84200, 300 phase amps 100a field, 230kmh, eye, in the air
[2025-01-08T13:31:38] Pandalgns: All this with a 60v 100a discharge battery (the original halo one)
[2025-01-08T13:33:19] Pandalgns: And my wheel got stuck accelerating due to too much field and I had to brake the wheel with the sole of my shoe... it melted a little and I had a hard time stopping it 😂😂😂
[2025-01-08T13:37:10] Pandalgns: It's like the tik tok videos that come out in scooter stores with "trick" smartgyros in the air marking 90kmh... put it on the ground it doesn't go over 50 😉
[2025-01-08T13:46:15] Jason: lol
[2025-01-08T13:54:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm thinking about switching to the g300 if the flipsky will die (god willing it wouldn't happen)
[2025-01-08T14:31:22] Yamal: 36Fet on the snow?
[2025-01-08T14:31:33] Jason: it's snsc2.3
[2025-01-08T14:31:40] Jason: my 18fet g30 has fucked up tire
[2025-01-08T14:31:59] Jason: I might take it out for snow riding if roads are also filled with snow
[2025-01-08T14:43:11] Yamal: You don’t want make dual g30,,?
[2025-01-08T14:46:45] Jason: maybe
[2025-01-08T14:46:52] Jason: dual g30 too much weight for me
[2025-01-08T14:47:19] Jason: I have to lift it to carry it onto trains
[2025-01-08T15:54:26] Matte: Id like to see how that battery is built from inside
[2025-01-08T16:01:24] rosheee: rofl ^^ ambrosini hyper overpriced crep
[2025-01-08T16:14:33] Pandalgns: I don't know, it's the stock one of the halo t107pro 60v 38.4ah bms 100a
[2025-01-08T16:15:17] Pandalgns: But the one he is really going to wear is a 20s 10p moli p45b
[2025-01-08T16:15:54] Pandalgns: Now it's just a test run.
[2025-01-08T16:17:15] Matte: Is there a build log somewhere of that battery? Id love to see that as well
[2025-01-08T16:38:11] Yamal: time to weld the bottom plate of the nami

[2025-01-08T17:10:09] Pandalgns: 20s10p p45b
[2025-01-08T17:10:42] Yamal: Very nice 👍

[2025-01-08T17:27:25] Mirono escooters: I wouldn't trust my own welds o-o

[2025-01-08T17:50:35] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Why weld?
[2025-01-08T17:55:56] Paolo ⁭: I think easiest is tig

[2025-01-08T18:21:32] Noname: What? Tig is art, mig is pull trigger grind off excess lol.
[2025-01-08T18:22:30] Noname: This you welding?
[2025-01-08T18:32:35] Matte: Thanks for sharing, is this furthest you got for now? Are you sure you have enough space for everything else you need to finish it up
[2025-01-08T18:44:58] Yamal: That's a long story, I'll tell you later.
[2025-01-08T18:45:26] Yamal: I welded it because a few weeks ago some welding points on the sheet metal underneath the Nami that holds the battery broke off,
[2025-01-08T18:45:40] Yamal: It's another man who welds xD
[2025-01-08T19:40:52] Pandalgns: Yes, at the moment it's going like this, the truth is that I have little time for it but I'm going little by little and yes in principle, if my calculations don't fail, it's going to come in just right, but it's going to come in

[2025-01-08T23:33:23] Jan: Dualtron hasnt made a single innovation in years
[2025-01-08T23:33:41] Jan: They for sure dont understand steering geometries like 95% of the companies
[2025-01-08T23:33:52] Jan: There are a few picking it up though now
[2025-01-08T23:34:08] Jan: Segway, Inmotion
[2025-01-08T23:52:29] NetworkDir: So motorcycle companies also don't understand steering geometries?
[2025-01-08T23:55:14] Jan: This
[2025-01-08T23:55:50] Jan: And you cant translate the same geometry to a smaller wheel diameter
[2025-01-08T23:55:52] Jan: Example
[2025-01-08T23:56:11] NetworkDir: It's depend to bike top speed - suspension and rake/trail geometries e-scooters also put trail as speed but some really bullshit like zero and kugoo
[2025-01-08T23:56:23] NetworkDir: Yeah it's depends to anything
[2025-01-08T23:56:33] Jan: If you move the wheel forward on a scooter, gg
[2025-01-08T23:56:38] NetworkDir: on dualtron seris i think just ultra 2 fine
[2025-01-08T23:56:52] NetworkDir: but metal and neck quality 🤡
[2025-01-08T23:57:15] Jan: Dualtron is a clownshow regarding frame integrity
[2025-01-08T23:57:31] NetworkDir: i say 95% scooters on market bullshit
[2025-01-08T23:57:53] NetworkDir: <sticker>

[2025-01-08T23:58:01] NetworkDir: XD
[2025-01-08T23:58:03] Jan: There is no perfect scooter, just less shitty for certain applications
[2025-01-08T23:58:28] NetworkDir: Yeah e-scooter market need a good engineering teams like bmw and ..
[2025-01-08T23:58:37] NetworkDir: motocycles mostly perfect even chinese ones
[2025-01-08T23:58:52] Noname: Love my vsett 11 but needs to be 2" longer
[2025-01-08T23:59:03] Jan: Thats what she said
[2025-01-08T23:59:31] NetworkDir: I am very happy that I switched from an electric scooter to a gasoline motorcycle. Of course, I am preparing a snsc 16s to go to nearby places
[2025-01-08T23:59:58] NetworkDir: vsett 11+ good for 80-100km/h but very heavy frame
[2025-01-09T00:00:19] Noname: That's what I like it's a tank
[2025-01-09T00:00:40] cihan: When doing copper sandwich welding, is it better to use nickel plated strip on top or pure 304 steel strip on top?
[2025-01-09T00:00:43] NetworkDir: Yeah ideal frame for modding
[2025-01-09T00:00:51] Jan: For.me 20kg is the max upper limit, and g30 max upper limit size
[2025-01-09T00:00:57] NetworkDir: At least i think doesn't snap
[2025-01-09T00:01:34] Noname: I liked the g30 but idk about your speeds that's seems sketchy to me
[2025-01-09T00:02:09] NetworkDir: g30 need at least 48V i love g30 with stock motor and 48v mod
[2025-01-09T00:02:12] NetworkDir: very good and smooth power
[2025-01-09T00:02:20] NetworkDir: and if 60-72v it's very cool
[2025-01-09T00:02:22] 'lekrsu': You want the wheel in front of the fork or behind it?
[2025-01-09T00:02:24] NetworkDir: but 72v fuck motor
[2025-01-09T00:02:28] Jan: For the size it is, about the driving feeling its about the same as vsett10+ at 60kmh
[2025-01-09T00:02:37] Jan: Behind
[2025-01-09T00:02:48] Jan: But this pictures confuses so fast.
[2025-01-09T00:03:11] Jan: Bike wheels are so big that you cannot steer them agile anymore if you dont set it further to the front
[2025-01-09T00:03:15] Noname: Mabey with suspension I had g30 vsett10
[2025-01-09T00:03:22] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_20714@09-01-2025_00-03-22.jpg>
[2025-01-09T00:03:37] NetworkDir: More trail = more stability & hard turns
[2025-01-09T00:03:52] Jan: Imagine now you have a tiny tiny wheel
[2025-01-09T00:04:01] Jan: Cant set it under the axle
[2025-01-09T00:04:02] 'lekrsu': Looks like the G3 rear suspension is the exact same mechanics as G2.
[2025-01-09T00:04:22] Jan: G3 has the trail offset for highspeed stability
[2025-01-09T00:04:33] NetworkDir: :)
[2025-01-09T00:04:38] NetworkDir: lmfao
[2025-01-09T00:05:09] Jan: From a trail perspective.its actually better, but center of gravity is so wrong on this one
[2025-01-09T00:05:57] NetworkDir: Unfortunately, things like this are not child's play There are many things that must be observed Even this high altitude causes problems
[2025-01-09T00:06:28] NetworkDir: And the companies that make scooters are only thinking about $$$. This is because no organization or gov in the world defines a certificate for them.
[2025-01-09T00:07:32] 'lekrsu': G3 will arrive before I complete my G2
[2025-01-09T00:07:36] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2025-01-09T00:07:49] NetworkDir: Yeah "Fuck quality i want just ride who cares" and bang.
[2025-01-09T00:08:16] Noname: Stupid people?
[2025-01-09T00:08:43] NetworkDir: On turkiye mostly use this shitcooter and they like it because "CHEAP" lol
[2025-01-09T00:08:50] NetworkDir: cheap = quality/fine on people brain
[2025-01-09T00:09:18] Noname: To get to work it's fine
[2025-01-09T00:09:27] NetworkDir: sadly no
[2025-01-09T00:09:40] Noname: To get a day off from work it's fine
[2025-01-09T00:09:50] NetworkDir: i say xiaomi pro2 better
[2025-01-09T00:09:53] 'lekrsu': Another thing, the new F2 Plus E II will have the former China-only suspension, 'F3 style'. Former model had no suspension.
[2025-01-09T00:10:42] 'lekrsu': Ninebot went back to Aluminium frames on the G3, what's all your opinions on that?
[2025-01-09T00:10:51] Noname: Remember people support their weight on stem so...
[2025-01-09T00:11:51] NetworkDir: Yes but anyway bad design and quality
[2025-01-09T00:12:03] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_20718@09-01-2025_00-12-03.jpg>
[2025-01-09T00:12:24] 'lekrsu': Their site has a huge banner "Aluminium" on G3
[2025-01-09T00:13:09] 'lekrsu': https://xk-en.segway.com/products/max-g3-e
[2025-01-09T00:13:29] NetworkDir: Cool tehir remake front shitty fork
[2025-01-09T00:13:35] NetworkDir: now this scooter buyable
[2025-01-09T00:14:14] 'lekrsu': Their GPS system on dash will be an additional cost.
[2025-01-09T00:14:56] cihan: If you dig deep down on it, it's problem of free market economy. Free market economy has some axioms. One of them is "all consumers can reach enough knowledge about all goods being sold to compare them and also can reach all price tags." This is false, consumers cannot know enough to evaluate all goods being sold and also cannot reach all price tags for same goods. So this is one big disadvantage of free market economy. That's something unavoidable.
[2025-01-09T00:15:07] NetworkDir: Their advertise yesterday?
[2025-01-09T00:15:22] 'lekrsu': The official G3 E site I sent above
[2025-01-09T00:16:21] 'lekrsu': 7.5" on the G3 too?
[2025-01-09T00:16:27] 'lekrsu': Oh shit
[2025-01-09T00:16:38] 'lekrsu': GT3 Pro here ^
[2025-01-09T00:17:18] NetworkDir: Very shitty
[2025-01-09T00:17:38] 'lekrsu': It'll be their first 72V model with 80 km/h speeds, without any regional restrictions, because it'll be sold as private property only.
[2025-01-09T00:18:11] cihan: Is external battery of G3 connected in parallel during ride or just a charger you carry for off grid charging?
[2025-01-09T00:18:31] Noname: It's a p100 rear gt2 front and a one of the economy model frames mashed up
[2025-01-09T00:18:35] 'lekrsu': Likely PWM like Ninebot ESx
[2025-01-09T00:19:04] 'lekrsu': Thus, the old ESx has 8 fets, ;)
[2025-01-09T00:19:21] Noname: I need to build one myself
[2025-01-09T00:20:09] 'lekrsu': Quick way to capitalize on the DIY market, but the permanent connector and all the plastic, eh.
[2025-01-09T00:20:41] Face de Pin Sucé: Stock setup yes, but as long as you set the arms at right height, you can go 150+Kmh without any troubles and without steering damper
[2025-01-09T00:21:56] 'lekrsu': Just hoping we get a full tear down video anytime soon, would love to watch it.
[2025-01-09T00:23:01] Face de Pin Sucé: https://youtu.be/FIRvMWQFl6A?si=YCThaEscMrhX7uSU
[2025-01-09T00:23:24] Face de Pin Sucé: I know that I spam this video everytime someone ask about dualtron stability
[2025-01-09T00:23:31] Face de Pin Sucé: But guys, just look at it
[2025-01-09T00:23:35] Face de Pin Sucé: No steering damper
[2025-01-09T00:23:49] Face de Pin Sucé: 150Kmh, hard braking, then full throttle
[2025-01-09T00:24:01] NetworkDir: But short stem modded suspensions and ...
[2025-01-09T00:24:05] Face de Pin Sucé: And I rode this escooter on streets at those speeds
[2025-01-09T00:24:41] NetworkDir: Also dt thunder frame good frame
[2025-01-09T00:24:45] NetworkDir: New dualtrons crap
[2025-01-09T00:25:02] Jan: Who approves a design like this?
[2025-01-09T00:25:14] NetworkDir: wtf this
[2025-01-09T00:25:18] Face de Pin Sucé: Modded suspensions ? Come on The only reason the arms are too high on Dualtron is because it's shorter, so smaller package for the containers and they put more escooters, then reduce cost of shipping per unit
[2025-01-09T00:25:48] Face de Pin Sucé: I find it very ugly but it's my point of view x)
[2025-01-09T00:25:56] NetworkDir: You can adjust suspension weight with 2 nuts
[2025-01-09T00:26:12] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_20723@09-01-2025_00-26-12.jpg>
[2025-01-09T00:26:15] Noname: Prob a group effort where everyone needed to have a say
[2025-01-09T00:26:25] Face de Pin Sucé: And Dualtron made the unique choice regarding all other brands to make their arms adjustable, which is best idea ever on escooter so far
[2025-01-09T00:26:43] NetworkDir: Yeah but sadly you drive on plastic
[2025-01-09T00:26:47] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, and it's perfect to get the good trail needed
[2025-01-09T00:26:50] NetworkDir: if plastic fail you done
[2025-01-09T00:26:58] Face de Pin Sucé: Plastic never fail
[2025-01-09T00:27:15] Face de Pin Sucé: I have some suspensions here that are 5 years old
[2025-01-09T00:27:30] NetworkDir: Depends to how you use it
[2025-01-09T00:27:33] Face de Pin Sucé: PU is compressed inside, it can't really fail actually
[2025-01-09T00:27:43] NetworkDir: if someone use these for off-road it's should fucked
[2025-01-09T00:28:17] Face de Pin Sucé: Have you actually seen one fucked ?
[2025-01-09T00:28:26] NetworkDir: i see 1 fucked
[2025-01-09T00:28:31] Face de Pin Sucé: Because I know some were using their Ultras for Off-road
[2025-01-09T00:28:41] NetworkDir: if i remember correct it's thunder 2
[2025-01-09T00:28:58] NetworkDir: Ultras use very hard cartridge
[2025-01-09T00:29:11] NetworkDir: For example thunder 3 use soft and shit
[2025-01-09T00:29:30] NetworkDir: X series also most bullshit design for ever
[2025-01-09T00:29:58] NetworkDir: Ultra 2 good if you can make a strong neck and stem
[2025-01-09T00:29:58] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. NetworkDir has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-09T00:30:12] cihan: I saw the video first time. I fell down when I leaned side that much only once at 20-30 km/h.))
[2025-01-09T00:42:20] 'lekrsu': Every crack in the road is now a power pellet
[2025-01-09T01:09:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I dmd u if can answer
[2025-01-09T01:20:23] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What is the right arms level?
[2025-01-09T02:01:41] Matte: No difference in welding performance but nickel is much more resistant to corrosion
[2025-01-09T02:05:49] Matte: depends which part is aluminum. Battery box body, great. Part that connects body to front suspension, TERRIBLE
[2025-01-09T07:43:11] Andrei Albert: The 11x first version that break banana🫠
[2025-01-09T07:44:32] Andrei Albert: My friend, he fell badly
[2025-01-09T07:50:57] Andrei Albert: Pu destroied
[2025-01-09T07:51:10] Andrei Albert: Highest level, no wobble
[2025-01-09T07:51:42] Andrei Albert: Tested on my thunder 2
[2025-01-09T07:51:43] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Andrei has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2025-01-09T08:27:31] Yamal: 💰💸…
[2025-01-09T08:28:48] Yamal: I also look at the nami, and it makes me sad that it doesn't have decent engines for the load I can carry, it hurts my soul.
[2025-01-09T09:01:38] Andrei Albert: When u buy new motors?
[2025-01-09T09:04:07] Yamal: Don’t know yet
[2025-01-09T09:04:37] Yamal: Butt everybody tell me :—- focus on the new project , forget Nami.. xD
[2025-01-09T09:12:30] Yamal: but really, after this long time trying things in the nami, it gives me courage to have to carry Hubssx tied
[2025-01-09T09:18:48] Yamal: I lowered the phase of the motor from 200 to 180A, when I got to the place to weld the sheet, I realized that the phases were hot"" but the worst thing was the foam that was on top of the battery, it was melted and the hose the phases embedded inside,, nothing worrying is normal,,, it's that bad white foam,, but you realize things,,^^
[2025-01-09T09:20:15] Yamal: <photos/photo_20725@09-01-2025_09-20-15.jpg>

[2025-01-09T09:26:23] 'lekrsu': Must've been quite hot to have that effect on the foam
[2025-01-09T09:27:39] Andrei Albert: Shiieeeeett
[2025-01-09T09:32:02] Yamal: Well, my maximum phase amperes programmed in this esc have been 200A, never greater than this, and it has gone from 180 to 200 and from 200 to 180 all the time.
[2025-01-09T10:02:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Lowest is track mode ? Because I've seen most go very low on the arms
[2025-01-09T10:02:44] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I can't go low because kickstand
[2025-01-09T10:03:17] Andrei Albert: Idk honestly just look cool

[2025-01-09T21:58:36] Matte: eesh thats a bit too much $
[2025-01-09T22:03:26] Andrei Albert: Yeah, not mine, borrowed from a friend
[2025-01-09T22:03:33] Andrei Albert: But now i want one so badly
[2025-01-09T22:25:38] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Here one with a X4 :) (Dual VESC on GT2) https://youtu.be/xe8OYRCdFm4

[2025-01-10T04:41:35] Kron Vark: Hello, i have a problem with my vesc, 11 inch 60v hub motor. Problem is the speed which is completely wrong. I want a more accurate reading. Wheel diameter is set at 270mm
[2025-01-10T04:41:56] Kron Vark: Also feel like it doesn’t read any values correct
[2025-01-10T05:45:35] Yamal: FRIDAY!!!

[2025-01-10T08:48:31] NetworkDir: Probably now 3.0 but you should set 1.0
[2025-01-10T08:51:34] Pandalgns: How much field did you put? I have the same values ​​at 60v with 100a field 😂😂
[2025-01-10T12:31:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 88.8 battery not good for flipsky 75200 pro V2 right?
[2025-01-10T12:32:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like at full battery it's 100.8
[2025-01-10T12:49:11] Pandalgns: I wouldn't risk it too much, I think they support a maximum of up to 96v I think I remember, 23s
[2025-01-10T12:58:34] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What vesc is a bit more expensive and supports 88v ?
[2025-01-10T13:05:57] Pandalgns: I don't know, because ubox is like double the price but I think they support the same plus less so imagine where you would have to go

[2025-01-10T14:52:28] Kron Vark: What should i put in on motor poles? Will this be the size of the magnets or?
[2025-01-10T14:52:57] Kron Vark: Motor poles was at 16 lmao
[2025-01-10T14:58:47] 'lekrsu': Set your physical magnet count in the rotor, not their size.
[2025-01-10T15:12:11] Kron Vark: What is the standard for 11 inch wheels?
[2025-01-10T15:13:31] 'lekrsu': Short two phases without a vesc connected and count the ticks for a full rotation, likely 30 poles if you don't want to count

[2025-01-10T17:55:25] Pandalgns: Guys, a question, how can I check that the hall sensors on my engine are okay? And if there is one failing, how can I know which one is failing?
[2025-01-10T17:58:14] Finn: There are tools to identify bad hall sensors.
[2025-01-10T17:58:43] Finn: Mostly used for ebike motors. use vss for your motor. Hall is useless😄
[2025-01-10T18:02:41] Pandalgns: It is the motor of my halo t107 pro, after changing the phase cables and those of the hall sensor, the front motor instead gives me a hall sensor error and I wanted to know if there is a way to detect if the sensors are definitely damaged of no specific gadget
[2025-01-10T18:04:38] Pandalgns: The issue is that having the hall sensor cables connected to the controller and with everything turned on, the multimeteo shows 1.89v in the three sensors and I move the wheel and the voltage does not change and a friend told me that this should not be the case.
[2025-01-10T18:24:14] Pandalgns: Front without hall rear with hall
[2025-01-10T18:24:15] Pandalgns: <video_file>

[2025-01-10T18:46:00] Patrick: Since when does this throttle work
[2025-01-10T18:47:13] Pandalgns: I have used the ak script for the vsett screens, which is a protocol the same as that of the qss4
[2025-01-10T18:50:34] Pandalgns: It is also very good because it has 3 normal gears and 2 in hidden mode to delimit it.
[2025-01-10T18:52:08] Kron Vark: Wait what, can you show me how to do it? I have a Vsett 10+ with vesc, really missing my speedometer tbh, have the original display on hand

[2025-01-10T20:07:49] Matte: Would SKYRC GSM020 help you perhaps?
[2025-01-10T20:07:56] Yamal: 🚀

[2025-01-10T21:56:56] Pandalgns: This is fucking crazy
[2025-01-10T21:57:24] Yamal: Still single ?
[2025-01-10T21:57:31] Pandalgns: Dual test
[2025-01-10T21:57:38] Yamal: Wouh
[2025-01-10T21:57:42] Yamal: Share data

[2025-01-10T21:57:54] Yamal: ..:(
[2025-01-10T21:58:02] Pandalgns: 🤪🤪🤪
[2025-01-10T21:58:20] Pandalgns: It's raining I can't prove much
[2025-01-10T21:59:11] Pandalgns: But in hidden mode gear 2 150 phase amps the front wheel does not stop burning tire and in mode 3 300a phase it burns both wheels
[2025-01-10T21:59:31] Yamal: Battery A?
[2025-01-10T22:00:08] Yamal: Almost the same me , now I’m going 180phase
[2025-01-10T22:00:30] Pandalgns: I don't know how the battery is holding up, it is the standard 60v 100a but I have 100a of battery in each controller and 300 of phase
[2025-01-10T22:00:41] Pandalgns: And it's fucking crazy
[2025-01-10T22:00:55] Yamal: 200A battery both controller ?
[2025-01-10T22:01:13] Pandalgns: 100a on each controller
[2025-01-10T22:01:30] Pandalgns: 200 between the two
[2025-01-10T22:01:46] Pandalgns: And the battery is 100a discharge 🤣🤣🤣
[2025-01-10T22:02:00] Yamal: Yes ! 200 total

[2025-01-10T22:07:08] Yamal: Anyway halo is in the next lvl right now
[2025-01-10T22:10:46] Matte: Why not go for cells better than molicel?
[2025-01-10T22:15:15] Pandalgns: It cost me 3 euros for a cell from a supplier that I took 200 at a time.
[2025-01-10T22:16:39] Pandalgns: I know there are better cells, although the p45b are also very good high discharge cells and for the price they cost me I think they are very good and new
[2025-01-10T22:18:44] Pandalgns: I'll probably have to turn on traction control with the 20s
[2025-01-10T22:21:53] Matte: if i understood your issue, this could perhaps help you https://www.perfectpassrc.com/products/skyrc-gnss-performance-analyzer-bluetooth-gps-speed-meter-data-logger-gsm020-sk-500023
[2025-01-10T22:22:21] Matte: p45b are incredible cells indeed
[2025-01-10T22:23:14] Pandalgns: Yes, it's going to be a tremendous battery.

[2025-01-10T23:20:23] Pandalgns: Yes, the nominal watts of each motor
[2025-01-10T23:22:34] Yamal: I need new engines for Nami, then I can sleep at night

[2025-01-11T19:01:37] Yamal: the Vesc boys are one step ahead of the majority
[2025-01-11T19:02:57] Noname: Chickens in E coast yes

[2025-01-12T19:52:50] Andrei Albert: Also no steering damper
[2025-01-12T19:55:39] Yamal: I'm not so much referring to your top speed, you're fast even if you don't want to be! I mean more about POWARRRRRRRR,,,, watt data, discharge A-- temperatures of your controllers, etc., that for me is where the really important thing is, the top speed is the icing on the cake of your conteuction and configuration
[2025-01-12T19:59:01] Yamal: but of course you must find your top speed and your extreme acceleration from 0-100kmh
[2025-01-12T19:59:47] Yamal: don't be in a hurry,
[2025-01-12T20:00:29] Andrei Albert: Have to do dat before i sell it

[2025-01-12T22:49:24] Yamal: The camera it’s just amazing
[2025-01-12T22:49:33] Yamal: Also the torque on 33/2
[2025-01-12T22:50:08] Yamal: I can see in some e-scooter 33/2 how the torque is …. 🤐
[2025-01-12T22:53:03] Yamal: I love powerful e-scooters, and not only for the top speed and torque, but rather for the harmony between cells/controller and motor
[2025-01-12T22:53:03] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2025-01-13T05:52:33] Andrei Albert: Insta 360 x3 camera
[2025-01-13T05:56:13] haku: good quality footage
[2025-01-13T06:25:52] Andrei Albert: Yes, really good camera
[2025-01-13T06:26:07] Andrei Albert: Full moon this morning
[2025-01-13T06:39:18] Yamal: It’s like top secret or what the new project ? XD
[2025-01-13T06:39:36] Jason: my battery is breaking the harmony
[2025-01-13T06:40:38] Yamal: Why
[2025-01-13T06:40:50] Jason: WEAK
[2025-01-13T06:40:56] Jason: 16s6p of mh1
[2025-01-13T06:41:03] Jason: getting tortured by mp2 and 17x4 65h
[2025-01-13T06:41:26] Jason: I'm drawing like 80~90a at accel lmao
[2025-01-13T06:41:33] Yamal: Why not get moli or 40t
[2025-01-13T06:41:39] Jason: no money
[2025-01-13T06:41:49] Jason: id love to get 40t but yeah I prob go 50s
[2025-01-13T06:42:09] Yamal: Also it’s made from your country right ?
[2025-01-13T06:42:13] Jason: yeah
[2025-01-13T06:42:16] Jason: but hard to get
[2025-01-13T06:42:18] Jason: for normies
[2025-01-13T06:44:21] Yamal: My batery it’s 40t and it’s also the first power battery i have
[2025-01-13T06:51:48] Yamal: You need a high discharge battery for your powerful MP2s, there is no option in your country to get second-hand cells so to speak, many times they are semi-new, coming from accidents or things like that...
[2025-01-13T06:56:08] Jason: I can somehow contact people who works in batt building industry and get some...
[2025-01-13T06:56:16] Jason: but money still the problem lol
[2025-01-13T06:56:21] Jason: 30s4p 50s pack for single 17x4 gonna be fine right?
[2025-01-13T07:00:00] Jason: gonna fly down the road at zooming speed weee
[2025-01-13T07:00:11] Jason: gotta require tiny bit of field weakening to go past 100kph barrier
[2025-01-13T07:00:11] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jason has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-13T07:00:12] Yamal: Why 17/4?
[2025-01-13T07:01:58] Yamal: oh sorry! I forgot, I used 22/3 in single for a while and it went very badly, 17/4 works well as do 16/4 and 33/2 in single?
[2025-01-13T07:02:42] Jason: 33x2 must be dual
[2025-01-13T07:02:53] Jason: 17x4 16x4 quite undrivable(too much torque)
[2025-01-13T07:03:01] Jason: can easily lose grip at front and fly
[2025-01-13T07:03:19] Jason: if i go 30s it's definitely wheelie machine even at high speed
[2025-01-13T07:03:22] Yamal: .
[2025-01-13T07:04:32] Yamal: Nice
[2025-01-13T07:04:39] Jason: anyway very fun to drive even it's single motor
[2025-01-13T07:04:44] Yamal: Nerved see before e-scooter on 30s
[2025-01-13T07:04:44] Jason: climbs hill like monster
[2025-01-13T07:04:54] Jason: overheats batt like a blowtorch
[2025-01-13T07:05:07] Jason: esc still chilling staying under 10c
[2025-01-13T07:05:21] Yamal: 33/2 with Mp2 become torque motor
[2025-01-13T07:05:26] Jason: lmao
[2025-01-13T07:05:30] Yamal: Just amazing
[2025-01-13T07:05:32] Jason: it's gonna blow the mp2
[2025-01-13T07:05:43] Jason: I wanna push 600a phase thru 33x2
[2025-01-13T07:05:46] Yamal: 33/2 with 300/400A phas e
[2025-01-13T07:05:54] Jason: wonder if it becomes 17x4 torque lmao
[2025-01-13T07:06:17] Yamal: It is as if the 33/2 engines had a larger body
[2025-01-13T07:06:33] Yamal: I have before in Namy
[2025-01-13T07:06:40] Jason: oo
[2025-01-13T07:07:00] Yamal: I mean stock Nami = 17-4 by Shaotao
[2025-01-13T07:07:39] Yamal: You can push 500A safe ?
[2025-01-13T07:07:57] Jason: 18fet TOLL esc developing
[2025-01-13T07:08:20] Andrei Albert: Nah, i don’t know what scooter to choose for new project
[2025-01-13T07:08:30] Jason: seems like it can push 600a phase reliably but it currently has unknown problem
[2025-01-13T07:08:37] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-01-13T07:08:47] Yamal: ….

[2025-01-13T07:09:30] Yamal: :(
[2025-01-13T07:09:31] Jason: gotta see if boards faulty or smth else is
[2025-01-13T07:09:56] Jason: I'm happy at least it spun the motor and produced beautiful sinewave at phase
[2025-01-13T07:10:47] Yamal: I thought that the rush to get your new scooter is because you really knew the new project you want to undertake.
[2025-01-13T07:34:57] Andrei Albert: I have one
[2025-01-13T07:36:46] Andrei Albert: If i knew what will sell this one yes but didn’t expect to go that fast

[2025-01-13T10:54:11] GABE: i crashed more times than i can count and my knee is bashed in atm after final worst crash
[2025-01-13T10:54:42] GABE: that was on a bicycle cant imagine a scoot at triple speed
[2025-01-13T10:55:49] GABE: difficult to sleep couldve been worse

[2025-01-13T12:22:20] 'lekrsu': Is it possible to run VescTool's TCP bridge with your phone's screen off?
[2025-01-13T12:30:53] NetworkDir: I ride yes but very unstable bad geometry I don't feel safe on scooter
[2025-01-13T12:32:01] NetworkDir: 40kW on low kV motors and shitty tires feel bad 😂
[2025-01-13T12:41:23] Jason: yes
[2025-01-13T12:41:44] 'lekrsu': How do you do it?
[2025-01-13T12:41:46] Jason: holy
[2025-01-13T12:41:47] Jason: <photos/photo_20806@13-01-2025_12-41-47.jpg>
[2025-01-13T12:42:07] Jason: I disable any batt save thing and set battery usage to unrestricted
[2025-01-13T12:42:18] Jason: <photos/photo_20807@13-01-2025_12-42-18.jpg>
[2025-01-13T12:42:35] Jason: it also prevents log data from getting fucked up
[2025-01-13T12:42:46] 'lekrsu': I've already allowed background usage, however I'm not running some Samsung skin.
[2025-01-13T12:42:53] Jason: hmmm
[2025-01-13T12:42:57] Jason: mine ran very fine
[2025-01-13T12:42:59] Jason: no disconnects
[2025-01-13T12:43:22] 'lekrsu': It'll instantly cut the tcp connection if I don't have the app visible.
[2025-01-13T12:43:56] Jason: damn
[2025-01-13T12:44:28] JPPL: Android can block app, and other app maybe can turn off screen without lock
[2025-01-13T12:44:52] JPPL: Everything will still running with vesc tool blocked
[2025-01-13T12:45:15] 'lekrsu': What?

[2025-01-13T12:45:55] Jason: hmm
[2025-01-13T12:46:04] 'lekrsu': That's a Samsung skin thing.
[2025-01-13T12:46:14] 'lekrsu': I'm running close to source on Pixel.
[2025-01-13T12:46:17] 'lekrsu': I could of course throw scrcpy in the background with the param to turn my display off wirelessly via adb, but defeats the point of it.
[2025-01-13T12:46:47] 'lekrsu': VescTool doesn't provide any 'keep-alive' notifications.
[2025-01-13T14:20:19] Rose: Hey there ———-, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2025-01-13T22:20:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 🤔
[2025-01-13T22:21:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He did 130
[2025-01-13T22:21:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I bet
[2025-01-13T22:21:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: My cousin is a gym maniac

[2025-01-13T22:33:17] haku: this is the kind of lift that will literally shit your pants
[2025-01-13T22:33:45] Paolo ⁭: I'm skinny haha
[2025-01-13T22:34:33] haku: dam boi!
[2025-01-13T22:34:47] haku: stregnth comes in all shapes
[2025-01-13T22:35:54] haku: i cant even get it an inch off the ground. 405 is easy reps for me with conventional. 1 hand is another level
[2025-01-13T22:36:34] Paolo ⁭: Try with my weight 130, it will be a lot easier ahah
[2025-01-13T22:37:00] haku: doubt it. next week again. im done dl today

[2025-01-13T22:52:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Can I clean here? 😉
[2025-01-13T22:52:39] Paolo ⁭: Everyone can, I'm weak XD
[2025-01-13T22:52:53] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Naaah bro I can't
[2025-01-13T22:53:00] Paolo ⁭: I'm the wrong guy to say that ahhaha
[2025-01-13T22:53:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm 63 kg no muscle
[2025-01-13T22:53:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 170cm always skinny type a guy
[2025-01-13T22:53:45] haku: remember boys weight doesnt always equal stregnth but it helps
[2025-01-13T22:53:59] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ops now 63 musered 3-4 days ago now remsured
[2025-01-13T22:54:48] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I prefer being skinny and muscler (for now only skinny😭)
[2025-01-13T22:54:54] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 61 srry
[2025-01-13T22:55:43] haku: i use to be like that when i was young. i just dont care nowadays.a little dad bod is okay i guess
[2025-01-13T22:55:59] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm extomorfe
[2025-01-13T22:56:34] haku: my nephew like that. lean and mean
[2025-01-13T22:57:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <video_file>
[2025-01-13T22:57:31] Yamal: https://youtu.be/xF1wu2bAmlM?si=JHPxBvukT7iBZXnD
[2025-01-13T22:57:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: More extomorfe that that ectomofe no way My chest be like his
[2025-01-13T22:57:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Already sent here I'll watch when have time
[2025-01-13T22:58:21] haku: i already shared that. did you see the pegs 😭
[2025-01-13T22:58:35] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Why spoil ahhah
[2025-01-13T23:01:22] haku: did you see the position of the pegs. how do you even sit down with how far it is. thats what they said.
[2025-01-13T23:03:21] 'lekrsu': 4 seasons here, so..
[2025-01-13T23:03:24] 'lekrsu': oh no
[2025-01-13T23:06:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: With legs bent like a super sport
[2025-01-13T23:07:07] haku: i see. not for regular comfort riding then
[2025-01-13T23:08:22] haku: remember when i predicted standing scooters getting bigger and adding seats and emotos getting smaller. they will meet in middle. thats hilarious
[2025-01-13T23:08:58] haku: point of a scooter is portability. wtf are these guys thinking
[2025-01-13T23:12:43] 'lekrsu': Coffee solves this
[2025-01-13T23:13:54] 'lekrsu': cheers
[2025-01-13T23:17:25] Mirono escooters: Tis 23:13 and blud drinks coffee
[2025-01-13T23:19:59] Jan: I see the trend more and more Hyperscooter = Offroad 60kg+ scooter
[2025-01-13T23:20:20] Jan: Power and durability
[2025-01-13T23:20:31] Jan: And then lightweight portable dies with that
[2025-01-13T23:20:54] Jan: People tend to destroy their scooter, so durability up=weight up.
[2025-01-13T23:21:26] Jan: More weight for durability, more power needed, this increases weight and more power is needed again.
[2025-01-13T23:23:04] haku: thats true.
[2025-01-13T23:23:59] haku: but the pegs is hilarious. first time ive seen one built in a standing scooter. with that said if you want to go seated need a short stem imo
[2025-01-13T23:25:37] haku: and c suspension they said will be better than kaabo gtr moto fork style
[2025-01-13T23:26:08] haku: im not a pro. im just talking out of my ass
[2025-01-13T23:29:43] GABE: Feel sick without it.
[2025-01-13T23:30:04] GABE: kek
[2025-01-13T23:34:41] Jan: Cant say if its better, i think C suspension is a legit way, however it comes with complications on the wheel placement
[2025-01-13T23:40:14] NetworkDir: C suspension with good trail angle and 2 stems good
[2025-01-13T23:40:22] NetworkDir: but anything with 1 stem mostly shitty
[2025-01-13T23:43:40] haku: gotcha. need to study these things
[2025-01-13T23:54:25] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's not a comfort scooter
[2025-01-14T00:02:06] haku: when i create peak g30v3 gen2 (for 2 genders) all from scratch someday ill need all these knowledge
[2025-01-14T00:03:43] haku: people will need a birth certificate to purchase one.
[2025-01-14T00:05:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: My thunder 2 will be for 2 much power for a 60kg rider ahah
[2025-01-14T00:35:29] Noname: Who doesn't?
[2025-01-14T00:40:57] Noname: Why you guys trying to lift 400lbs. That's why I have a tractor
[2025-01-14T00:43:05] Noname: I swear auto part store just mess with you and give you the wrong parts for fun.
[2025-01-14T00:44:03] Noname: Would have been world's fastest toss brake pads in dilligaf style ever
[2025-01-14T00:51:25] haku: because we can
[2025-01-14T00:52:22] Noname: You know if you can do that there's people that pay you to carry shit on job sites
[2025-01-14T00:52:50] Noname: I'm good with the permanent spine damage
[2025-01-14T00:53:07] haku: god forbid someday you get stuck under a car and im not there
[2025-01-14T00:53:23] Noname: Hope so, I'll go quietly
[2025-01-14T00:53:55] haku: i will not allow it. thats why we lift 400lbs
[2025-01-14T00:54:19] Noname: I got stuck under a pile of snowmobiles once. Wasn't gonna be long till I faded.
[2025-01-14T00:55:07] haku: if you brace your core properly it will not cause spine damage.
[2025-01-14T00:55:28] Noname: Already have a hernia
[2025-01-14T00:56:53] haku: dl is not really a necessary excercise imo. i just like doing it.
[2025-01-14T02:56:23] Franchesco Carofano: What good controllers do you recommend 12 moffe?
[2025-01-14T03:20:35] Franchesco Carofano: He encontrado esto en AliExpress: CLP292.007 | Controlador de aluminio Spintend 85V 240A único Ubox basado en VESC Bluetooth fusible E-wheel adaptador ADC para Escooter Ebike Onewheel https://a.aliexpress.com/_mLJtjmf

[2025-01-14T03:27:31] haku: yea. i really dont know about these new ones. no reviews yet but spintend normally good affordable brand
[2025-01-14T03:32:53] Franchesco Carofano: Ready are the 250 but they are a little more expensive I found those cheaper

[2025-01-14T03:42:24] Franchesco Carofano: I ask what the difference is and they send me that
[2025-01-14T04:00:21] haku: i would suggest to buy the old one because thats been tested. but eithet one should be good. the new one is smaller. i kinda like the size
[2025-01-14T04:05:31] Franchesco Carofano: Yes, of course, it's because of the difference in money. Let's wait to see who else tells me something between now and tomorrow.
[2025-01-14T04:14:58] Noname: It's a 10$ difference
[2025-01-14T04:15:56] Franchesco Carofano: no dad look
[2025-01-14T04:16:08] Noname: Si senior I did look

[2025-01-14T04:37:48] haku: if your in EU james is the daddy of spintends
[2025-01-14T04:38:50] haku: he has alot of experience with these spintend vescs
[2025-01-14T04:43:26] Noname: Spintend.com
[2025-01-14T04:43:44] Noname: Only Haku calls me daddy
[2025-01-14T04:44:22] Noname: Gosh the internet is weird
[2025-01-14T07:02:50] Yamal: Good question
[2025-01-14T07:04:23] Yamal: they look very similar
[2025-01-14T07:05:15] Yamal: How's the summer going brother?
[2025-01-14T07:05:34] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-01-14T07:21:19] Yamal: Let's hope that the laws in the EU for e-scooters change, today in my country I can circulate with my e-scooter until January 2027, then it will not be legal to circulate on the street unless. let the law change...
[2025-01-14T07:21:19] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-14T07:22:38] Pandalgns: @jamaludin_algarnati good morning, right now we are already circulating illegally with our modified scooters 😂😂 we are fugitives from the law
[2025-01-14T07:23:51] Yamal: We will have to certify our e-scooters, an expensive and tedious task
[2025-01-14T07:24:50] Yamal: We are legal today! There is no power limit, the only thing is to be limited to 25kmh
[2025-01-14T07:25:34] Yamal: circulate in urban cycle etc.
[2025-01-14T07:30:29] Yamal: but we have 2 years without worries 25/26... to fully enjoy, if nothing comes out by then at the European level, it will depend on the price of the certification, hence the circuits are something interesting and fun for the powerful e-scooter! Maybe when the time comes, it is best to buy an e-scooter certified and approved by DGT and ride VESC to ride the wave.
[2025-01-14T07:44:27] Arnau Martinez Casals: Burned my spintend 100v 100a dual alubox at 20s(84max)with 50a battery 130 phase
[2025-01-14T07:46:33] Arnau Martinez Casals: They are Sending me the 85v 150a on warranty paying price difference, but i see diferent sites saying max 19s (83v)
[2025-01-14T07:46:59] Arnau Martinez Casals: It supports the 20s without regen?
[2025-01-14T08:03:32] Yamal: The way to come work !
[2025-01-14T08:04:01] Rose: Hey there Furkan, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-01-14T08:17:05] Yamal: <video_file>

[2025-01-14T09:29:05] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes
[2025-01-14T09:38:25] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-01-14T09:39:14] Pandalgns: At the moment, the insurance that I took out on the scooter allows me any size, any weight, without power limit or speed limit on the scooter, so I am covered by my insurance with my halo.
[2025-01-14T09:53:24] Matte: unfortunately. Scooters should be something you can lift to carry down the stairs and not weigh same as a smaller person jesus christ
[2025-01-14T09:58:40] Matte: So smol
[2025-01-14T10:21:55] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And that's dual
[2025-01-14T10:32:15] Matte: yep
[2025-01-14T10:38:00] Yamal: Big scooter like moto man
[2025-01-14T10:38:05] Yamal: Power and range
[2025-01-14T10:38:15] Yamal: Small one for Daly City,,
[2025-01-14T10:41:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But is it powerful?
[2025-01-14T10:43:03] Matte: there is literally numbers and letters on it
[2025-01-14T10:46:30] Jason: that's why I go only single motor
[2025-01-14T10:46:33] Jason: still heavy
[2025-01-14T10:46:41] Jason: but can carry down the stairs
[2025-01-14T10:47:46] Jan: I think scooters shouldnt be two digits weight 🤷
[2025-01-14T10:49:59] Matte: in pounds yea
[2025-01-14T10:55:30] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 100 battery amps?
[2025-01-14T10:55:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Or phase amps?
[2025-01-14T10:58:07] Alex: Hello guys
[2025-01-14T10:58:23] Jan: 😅
[2025-01-14T10:58:54] Alex: Today when i ride to work my bluetooth modul and maybe can gone and the front motor doesnt get throttle what can be the problem?
[2025-01-14T11:01:52] Matte: phase amps, its always phase amps
[2025-01-14T11:02:07] Matte: and its 2x 200A not 100
[2025-01-14T11:03:28] Yamal: ……
[2025-01-14T11:03:29] Matte: oh thats what you mean, my bad
[2025-01-14T11:03:31] Matte: <photos/photo_20823@14-01-2025_11-03-31.jpg>
[2025-01-14T11:03:37] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-01-14T11:06:32] Yamal: It all depends on the use that is given to it,
[2025-01-14T11:08:54] Yamal: My first scooter was the dt thunder with 35 ah, so I still haven't conceived the idea of a small scooter, I also live outside the city and my routes are always long or rather outside the urban center
[2025-01-14T11:09:28] Yamal: But I like all the e-scooter 🫰👍
[2025-01-14T11:09:51] Jason: my current scoot is 24kg
[2025-01-14T11:10:08] Yamal: Nice weight
[2025-01-14T11:11:34] Matte: 27kg here, new to scooters but definitely not new to EVs and batteries. The scooter will gain a kilo or two with battery im building for it tho
[2025-01-14T11:13:56] Jason: mm
[2025-01-14T11:14:05] Yamal: Frame ?
[2025-01-14T11:14:14] Matte: yes, it has one
[2025-01-14T11:14:28] Yamal: But what frame I mean ^^
[2025-01-14T11:16:06] Matte: i know im messing with you, i won this thing as a prize
[2025-01-14T11:16:27] Matte: bought an air fryer and entered the contest and won it
[2025-01-14T11:17:22] Yamal: XD
[2025-01-14T11:17:37] Yamal: Nice 🫰
[2025-01-14T11:18:02] Yamal: Where are you from Matte
[2025-01-14T11:18:30] 'lekrsu': I'm safe still 😇
[2025-01-14T11:18:48] Matte: Croatia
[2025-01-14T11:20:26] Yamal: Find BV man it’s just near you …
[2025-01-14T11:20:31] Pandalgns: My halo weighs around 55 kg 😅😅 I have a hard time getting on the chair to repair it, I can't imagine a second or third one on stairs
[2025-01-14T11:20:40] Yamal: Ask to come ❕
[2025-01-14T11:20:52] 'lekrsu': I approximate 31 kg on my G2 🥹
[2025-01-14T11:21:03] 'lekrsu': +- a couple kg
[2025-01-14T11:21:29] Yamal: Like toro”” :p
[2025-01-14T11:21:57] 'lekrsu': Is it a Flipsky? Bluetooth randomly malfunctioning?
[2025-01-14T11:22:19] 'lekrsu': Who's toro 😭
[2025-01-14T11:22:35] 'lekrsu': Heard that there were signs of a failing Flipsky
[2025-01-14T11:29:31] Maximus Brokus: The first sign is the billing on your bank account :D
[2025-01-14T11:30:13] Maximus Brokus: Sounds like my friends madmax problem, its propably a failing controller :D
[2025-01-14T11:31:24] Maximus Brokus: I hate him for that, he comes every week with a new problem and I keep on telling him to migrate to a new system. But he incist on borrowing my tools
[2025-01-14T11:31:36] Yamal: 🐂
[2025-01-14T11:32:04] Yamal: “ toro bravo “
[2025-01-14T11:46:45] GABE: Holy shit
[2025-01-14T11:47:43] Matte: its nice, im not complaining abou it much being that it was free. Its just that the battery compartment is a tube, there is no opening at the top. only opening from front or back where wheels are
[2025-01-14T11:48:28] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 200 per motor ?
[2025-01-14T11:48:38] Matte: yea
[2025-01-14T11:48:48] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But thats peak not continues
[2025-01-14T11:49:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: How much battery amps?
[2025-01-14T11:49:42] Matte: <photos/photo_20825@14-01-2025_11-49-42.jpg>
[2025-01-14T11:49:54] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Maybe it's a safe replacement to 2 75200
[2025-01-14T11:50:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So it's not the 75200 is theoretically better
[2025-01-14T11:50:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So if I want to go with go foc it's the g300 and 2 of them
[2025-01-14T11:50:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Which going to be expensive
[2025-01-14T11:51:05] Yamal: Sad
[2025-01-14T11:51:09] Yamal: Like Dt mini
[2025-01-14T11:51:30] Matte: You dont go vesc if you want cheap
[2025-01-14T11:51:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Mine is also going to be 36ah
[2025-01-14T11:51:49] 'lekrsu': Scooters, and phase current, does not operate continuously, so it wouldn't be accurate to say that.
[2025-01-14T11:52:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But 220 bms and Lishen 21700LA cells
[2025-01-14T11:52:43] Matte: you dont go vesc if you want continuous rating either lol
[2025-01-14T11:53:04] 'lekrsu': Then you get a DC motor generator 😁
[2025-01-14T11:53:30] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm ok with ubox pricing but the website doesn't ship to me
[2025-01-14T11:54:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes but I'm planning on setting battery amps 80a per vesc
[2025-01-14T11:54:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Would that thing handle that ?
[2025-01-14T11:54:37] Yamal: Ubox C?
[2025-01-14T11:55:58] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No 75200 pro V2
[2025-01-14T11:56:00] Matte: i dont have a crystal ball
[2025-01-14T11:56:17] Matte: i wouldnt even go VESC if i had the space
[2025-01-14T11:56:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes I know shit vesc but that's what I could afford
[2025-01-14T11:56:27] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Maybe upgrade after
[2025-01-14T11:59:07] Matte: would get two Kelly puma controlers and my life would be much easier
[2025-01-14T11:59:49] Rose: Hey there Dualtron, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-01-14T12:01:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Are they any good ?
[2025-01-14T12:02:03] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is the only reason people are going with vesc is the space ?
[2025-01-14T12:02:41] Arnau Martinez Casals: All ones brokes before Or after
[2025-01-14T12:02:42] Dualtron Achilleus: G300 really good can took 200A batterie and 500phase amp
[2025-01-14T12:02:53] Matte: vesc is open source and that is huge, but its not like other controllers are dumb nowadays, almost all of them have an app to adjust parameters
[2025-01-14T12:03:07] Dualtron Achilleus: But heat faster that ubox 85 250
[2025-01-14T12:03:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes but I like the feeling of vesc
[2025-01-14T12:04:21] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: If the 75200 (both of them) will die I'll get the g300
[2025-01-14T12:04:46] Maximus Brokus: Its not also that, in comparison and setup properly VESC ist way more efficient
[2025-01-14T12:04:51] Dualtron Achilleus: 75 200 v2 can only 110A batt and 270phase
[2025-01-14T12:04:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Because I also have 2 84100hp that worked perfectly fine for 7-8 months
[2025-01-14T12:05:12] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: My battery can do less I think so...
[2025-01-14T12:05:19] Dualtron Achilleus: 300phase max if only few peak
[2025-01-14T12:06:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I have 60h motors and 72/36 220a bms battery
[2025-01-14T12:06:11] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah useless to go g300 then
[2025-01-14T12:06:38] Dualtron Achilleus: What cells?
[2025-01-14T12:06:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Lishen 21700LA
[2025-01-14T12:06:50] Dualtron Achilleus: Hum
[2025-01-14T12:06:58] Dualtron Achilleus: What is the rated peak A of thid
[2025-01-14T12:07:00] Dualtron Achilleus: This
[2025-01-14T12:07:11] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 35a per cell
[2025-01-14T12:07:11] Matte: its a 35a discharge cell but equally important i want to see his interconnections on the battery
[2025-01-14T12:07:37] Matte: some of the "my battery is 300A discharge" posts ive seen were hilarious
[2025-01-14T12:07:46] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah sure if 0,2 nikel xd going to burn
[2025-01-14T12:07:49] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's made by a professional in this group
[2025-01-14T12:07:53] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Of course
[2025-01-14T12:08:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: @ReChargy show them your work
[2025-01-14T12:08:21] Dualtron Achilleus: Some guys goes crazy bypassing their bms
[2025-01-14T12:08:22] Matte: i dont know, a lot of people call themselves professional. Maybe this person is, i dont know
[2025-01-14T12:09:01] Dualtron Achilleus: Go sandwish cooper for hight discharge
[2025-01-14T12:09:21] Matte: but ive also seen someone claim their battery is xyz amps, and then they say their voltage drops to 3V per cell under that load. Like... Sir, no.
[2025-01-14T12:09:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: https://www.tiktok.com/@rechargy?_t=ZS-8t3cm6qHpU9&_r=1
[2025-01-14T12:10:02] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'll verify that is a genuine cells
[2025-01-14T12:10:26] Dualtron Achilleus: Nice job
[2025-01-14T12:10:36] Dualtron Achilleus: Now go tabless cell
[2025-01-14T12:10:43] Dualtron Achilleus: Can 70A per cell
[2025-01-14T12:10:56] Dualtron Achilleus: Like 40 pl jp40 and bak 45d
[2025-01-14T12:11:21] Matte: looks good, props to the builder
[2025-01-14T12:11:54] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Cost ?
[2025-01-14T12:12:10] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I can go Moli with that guy but price difference is a lot
[2025-01-14T12:12:31] Matte: need to be careful with those models because individual cells do hit those discharge rates while other do 10% less. They are not consistent
[2025-01-14T12:13:37] Dualtron Achilleus: https://www.nkon.nl/fr/rechargeable/li-ion/21700-20700-size/bak-n21700-45d-4400mah-60a.html

[2025-01-14T12:14:23] Dualtron Achilleus: I dont get it
[2025-01-14T12:15:06] Dualtron Achilleus: Ofc you not going to use then for max discharge
[2025-01-14T12:15:22] Matte: like out of 10 cells, 5 do discharge at 60A and dont overheat, but 5 do overheat
[2025-01-14T12:15:26] Matte: different internal resistance
[2025-01-14T12:15:30] Dualtron Achilleus: Then can even 100A for few sec
[2025-01-14T12:15:49] Dualtron Achilleus: Internal resistance should be constant
[2025-01-14T12:15:52] Matte: not as consistent as molicel rating
[2025-01-14T12:16:02] Dualtron Achilleus: Where did you see their is different?
[2025-01-14T12:16:07] Matte: should but arent
[2025-01-14T12:16:21] Matte: tested a batch at work
[2025-01-14T12:16:35] Matte: im not saying they are bad
[2025-01-14T12:16:48] Dualtron Achilleus: Okay
[2025-01-14T12:17:02] Dualtron Achilleus: But the drop voltage is sonlow compare to normal cellesp
[2025-01-14T12:17:14] Matte: yeah they are really powerful
[2025-01-14T12:17:36] Matte: almost lipo territory
[2025-01-14T12:17:55] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah like 18c
[2025-01-14T12:21:10] Dualtron Achilleus: I gonna build one this years with this
[2025-01-14T12:22:20] Matte: EVE INR21700-40P unbeatable price to performance
[2025-01-14T12:27:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Why people won't go with lipo ?
[2025-01-14T12:27:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Dengores?
[2025-01-14T12:31:10] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah, but pref are like 40t?
[2025-01-14T12:31:16] Dualtron Achilleus: Prefs

[2025-01-14T12:40:30] David: Not used 40pl yet. But did with JP40 IMO a bit better then the 40pl
[2025-01-14T12:45:31] Alex: Ubox 85v 200a The 2 ubox separetly works spins the motors but they dont communicate and the bluetooth modul dont work
[2025-01-14T12:47:10] Dualtron Achilleus: Its this art?
[2025-01-14T12:48:17] David: No JP40 photos Client wanted to stay anonymous and requested not to publish the work as due some designs add-ons will give him right away
[2025-01-14T12:48:53] David: The build you see now on the channel are Lishen 21700LA & Molicel P45B
[2025-01-14T12:54:51] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Sticking cells together with no cell holder? (ok you use glass fiber tape on each row as far as i can see.
[2025-01-14T12:59:33] David: Yes glass fiber tape Years of experience No problems yet.
[2025-01-14T13:04:54] Matte: Great builds, is copper 0.1, 0.15, 0.2mm?
[2025-01-14T13:06:59] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes imo
[2025-01-14T13:35:40] David: It changes from 0.15 and to 0.2 Depending on the max current
[2025-01-14T13:35:48] David: But soon will be 0.2 only
[2025-01-14T13:38:26] Dualtron Achilleus: And what nickel thinkness?
[2025-01-14T13:38:46] David: 0.15
[2025-01-14T14:54:04] Maximus Brokus: Maybe disabled CAN somewhere in settings
[2025-01-14T15:05:36] Noname: You think wood frame is good? Might buy one
[2025-01-14T15:10:03] David: Depends on what kind of wood. It's is very good wood but I forgot the the type. My father in law working with wood and suggest me to build from that specific type. I'll ask him once I'll land

[2025-01-14T15:25:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Here we go now we getting serious about a new battery 🔋🔋
[2025-01-14T15:25:53] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'll go mussre battery space in the thunder
[2025-01-14T15:26:01] Noname: Think it was bamboo or something Asian 😆
[2025-01-14T15:26:35] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Keep it kosher here if you like wood keep it to yourself 😉😉
[2025-01-14T16:25:25] Noname: It's Thai oak or resin not flesh wood
[2025-01-14T16:27:35] haku: this i 100% agree. the the only reason to stand is to fold the stem and light for portability
[2025-01-14T16:27:52] haku: otherwise you know my policy
[2025-01-14T16:41:19] haku: you into asians now eh.
[2025-01-14T16:46:21] haku: is this new? what cells this?
[2025-01-14T17:47:37] Smart Repair: Can someone tell me what this error means?
[2025-01-14T17:51:54] Smart Repair: The error occurred at high speed and max current. Unfortunately I forgot to open the terminal.

[2025-01-14T19:00:15] JPPL: Similar specs as previous but fieldweaking added, options to choose connectors etc
[2025-01-14T19:05:21] Yamal: 300A only 20s..
[2025-01-14T19:08:24] Smart Repair: everything still works. I suspect it's because of the two different motors. GT1 stock at the front, 70H 22x3 at the back. One motor has probably reached its limits 🤷‍♂️
[2025-01-14T19:08:33] Yamal: What good purchasing options! you can order them protected for water
[2025-01-14T19:09:35] Smart Repair: I will observe and log it in the next few days. So far it has not happened again
[2025-01-14T19:10:18] Yamal: 24kw….
[2025-01-14T19:11:18] Smart Repair: No.... Second Run 25 Peak 😁
[2025-01-14T19:11:21] Yamal: Real 135 kmh?
[2025-01-14T19:12:04] Smart Repair: 118 GPS. the 135 come from the spinning front engine
[2025-01-14T19:12:32] Yamal: Anyway 24kw’m
[2025-01-14T19:12:43] Yamal: How is your battery ,,?
[2025-01-14T19:14:17] Yamal: Run with 300A battery ,,?
[2025-01-14T19:14:19] Smart Repair: 20s9p 40p. Vdrop at 350A Batt is around 12V. I'm thinking about building a new battery from 40pl. Let's see how it is when it's warmer outside
[2025-01-14T19:15:33] Yamal: Your setting it’s 150A per controller
[2025-01-14T19:20:39] Smart Repair: I'm not entirely sure. 340A (250 ubox) at the back and 170A (150 ubox) phase at the front.
[2025-01-14T19:24:35] Yamal: A battery I mean
[2025-01-14T19:24:52] Yamal: 340 XD
[2025-01-14T19:33:53] Smart Repair: there is still some room for improvement 🤏
[2025-01-14T19:36:31] JPPL: Yes they upgraded a few things, seems nice overall! I'm reorganising my blade escooter with Kelly cuz I burned one somehow connecting, and studying and searching I noticed they have much more options now, manuals were upgraded, new app etc
[2025-01-14T19:43:36] Smart Repair: yes, IQ target is activated on the 70H

[2025-01-14T20:18:23] haku: based rappers only
[2025-01-14T20:32:46] Dualtron Achilleus: vest data sheet is fake , look at your bms stats that a real stat
[2025-01-14T20:33:14] Dualtron Achilleus: there is voltage peak on these data always making the stat bigger than there are for real
[2025-01-14T20:34:16] Smart Repair: It is clear that these are peak values
[2025-01-14T20:35:27] Dualtron Achilleus: no its voltage spike but not the real peak of power
[2025-01-14T20:36:19] Dualtron Achilleus: yeah
[2025-01-14T20:36:37] Dualtron Achilleus: look bms stat for real stat if you have ants bms for instance
[2025-01-14T20:36:52] Dualtron Achilleus: even if i dont doub you have lot of power😌
[2025-01-14T20:37:35] Smart Repair: According to the log it was around 22-23 kW continuously.
[2025-01-14T20:38:33] Dualtron Achilleus: what scooter you runnig
[2025-01-14T20:38:33] Smart Repair: thanks for the tip. I will deactivate it and see if the error comes back
[2025-01-14T20:39:02] Smart Repair: gt1 converted to dual
[2025-01-14T20:40:27] Dualtron Achilleus: gt1 idk
[2025-01-14T20:40:33] Dualtron Achilleus: brand?
[2025-01-14T20:42:53] Smart Repair: Segway
[2025-01-14T20:44:47] Dualtron Achilleus: your 70 H is speed?
[2025-01-14T20:44:57] Dualtron Achilleus: how much FW you put on your ubox
[2025-01-14T20:54:24] Smart Repair: No, Balance 22x3
[2025-01-14T20:54:36] Dualtron Achilleus: 22 3 is torque
[2025-01-14T20:54:46] Smart Repair: 30a fw per ESC
[2025-01-14T20:55:06] Dualtron Achilleus: okay tks
[2025-01-14T20:55:17] Dualtron Achilleus: you ubox is stock?
[2025-01-14T20:55:21] Smart Repair: Na... 17x4 ist Torque
[2025-01-14T20:55:31] Smart Repair: Yes
[2025-01-14T20:56:01] Dualtron Achilleus: how much kmh in free spin without fw
[2025-01-14T20:56:59] Smart Repair: I don't remember. I think around 90kmh. But I'm not sure anymore
[2025-01-14T20:58:53] Dualtron Achilleus: okay tks
[2025-01-14T20:58:53] Smart Repair: more torque than speed. I just call it balance because it has medium KV. 17x4, 22x3 and 33x2
[2025-01-14T20:59:13] Dualtron Achilleus: idk everyon say 22 by 3 is torque
[2025-01-14T20:59:19] Yamal: Difficult to find song for Vesc controller s
[2025-01-14T20:59:50] Dualtron Achilleus: mine goes 71 at on 16 S

[2025-01-14T21:01:24] haku: what about fardriver? what song is best suited for that?
[2025-01-14T21:02:25] Smart Repair: What diameter is your brake disc and which brake caliper do you have installed?
[2025-01-14T21:05:13] Dualtron Achilleus: i ahvent installed yet on my scooter
[2025-01-14T21:05:19] Dualtron Achilleus: this week end i wil
[2025-01-14T21:05:36] Dualtron Achilleus: i guess ihave 17by 4 then
[2025-01-14T21:05:40] Dualtron Achilleus: or maybe like you
[2025-01-14T21:05:57] Dualtron Achilleus: no i have 75H its different
[2025-01-14T21:05:58] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Dualtron has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-14T21:07:40] Yamal: Try to make post about different Vesc controller..
[2025-01-14T21:08:45] Dualtron Achilleus: lower KW than 70 h
[2025-01-14T21:09:43] Dualtron Achilleus: <photos/photo_20853@14-01-2025_21-09-43.jpg>
[2025-01-14T21:10:26] Dualtron Achilleus: torque is 22by 3 on this i guess according to you stats
[2025-01-14T21:12:18] haku: 3shull?

[2025-01-15T00:01:53] Matte: its a tiny controller, very impressive
[2025-01-15T00:16:26] Smart Repair: Is there a trick to using traction control with 2 different motors? 40 poles at the front, 30 poles at the rear. When I use traction control, it intervenes permanently and reduces the power, even when the tire is not spinning. (Video is without TC)
[2025-01-15T00:40:19] Smart Repair: I thought so... so I'll order a new tire for the front 😀
[2025-01-15T00:40:58] JPPL: I love those puma, will search more, don't forget about one thing, Kelly says kls7212 does 120a for 1 minut motor amp and 50 continuous, but in fact it shows this values on tool I attached, I think they are not for read values only... They hit this kind of values

[2025-01-15T01:13:15] 'lekrsu': Your doggo is fast! haha
[2025-01-15T01:31:06] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Only 118 in 24kw?
[2025-01-15T01:34:28] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Put at 50 at least
[2025-01-15T01:36:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I got 100kmh on 16s and 50h motors you should get wayy faster not 118kmh
[2025-01-15T01:36:20] haku: 18mph gps verified
[2025-01-15T01:36:52] 'lekrsu': Pigeon powered VESC competition
[2025-01-15T01:38:34] Smart Repair: how many KV? I have 29kv, a lot of torque but not a good top speed
[2025-01-15T01:38:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: That I don't know
[2025-01-15T01:39:15] JPPL: That's why less speed
[2025-01-15T01:39:19] Patrick: I got 113kmh at 22s and 22kw and 2x60H. It depends at motor winding. Tourqe motors stay much more cool and they more efficient. Speed motors use much more energy if you drive same speed, and get more hot.
[2025-01-15T01:39:25] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also rear motor was a mantis 10 and front zero10x
[2025-01-15T01:40:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Maybe push more fwk?
[2025-01-15T01:40:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Because I was pushing 60a fwk per motor in that zero10x
[2025-01-15T01:40:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And 85a phase amps
[2025-01-15T01:40:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 55a battery
[2025-01-15T01:40:47] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Shlomozero10🇮🇱 has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-15T01:41:36] Patrick: Field weakening 62A. Battery Amp100A and 200Phase.
[2025-01-15T01:41:43] Smart Repair: how much does your scooter weigh?
[2025-01-15T01:41:56] Matte: how many phase amps can mantis motor take?
[2025-01-15T01:43:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 45-50kg I think
[2025-01-15T01:43:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 80-100 depends how much is fwk also
[2025-01-15T01:44:26] Matte: zero 10x motor similar i assume?
[2025-01-15T01:44:33] Matte: 5kw is not bad for those lil motors
[2025-01-15T01:44:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Weird because I got 98kmh on gps and 105 against a car (in other run)
[2025-01-15T01:44:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Was running 9kw
[2025-01-15T01:45:10] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <video_file>
[2025-01-15T01:45:44] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Shittyier motor
[2025-01-15T01:46:02] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Hope I get better results
[2025-01-15T01:46:02] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Shlomozero10🇮🇱 has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-15T01:46:22] Matte: so almost 5kw per motor, thats great for those tiny phase wires
[2025-01-15T01:46:24] Smart Repair: Both esc together are 520A phase and 30A FW each. My scooter weighs around 65kg. The engines are simply not designed for high speeds
[2025-01-15T01:46:24] Smart Repair: <photos/photo_20858@15-01-2025_01-46-24.jpg>
[2025-01-15T01:46:35] 'lekrsu': 60A fw at 85A phase? Makes no sense. Build your setup to support the speeds more efficiently if that's your goal.
[2025-01-15T01:48:34] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I don't remember setup I did it long time ago
[2025-01-15T01:48:46] Matte: barely holding onto the bars while accelerating is more fun anyways
[2025-01-15T01:49:19] 'lekrsu': The goal is to not use any field weakening at all.
[2025-01-15T01:49:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But was like 110 phase amps rear (60fwk) And 80 phase amps front (60fwk)
[2025-01-15T01:49:35] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Was shit without
[2025-01-15T01:49:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I tried
[2025-01-15T01:49:51] 'lekrsu': Get larger, higher kV motors then.
[2025-01-15T01:50:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ive set like 180 phase amps and was shit
[2025-01-15T01:50:27] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Now I have 2 kaabo wolf 60h motors
[2025-01-15T01:50:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But I don't know winding and kv
[2025-01-15T01:51:07] Matte: why would that be the goal, field weakening is amazing
[2025-01-15T01:51:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I just found this on AliExpress: ₪1,332.75 | Original Kaabo Wolf Warrior 11 Motor/Engine Kaabo Wolf Warrior GT Motor/Engine 60V 1200W 11Iinch Motor for Wolf Warrior 11/GT https://a.aliexpress.com/_ooGa5w9
[2025-01-15T01:51:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Makes motor hot
[2025-01-15T01:51:36] Patrick: Why weird? I have 16x4 tourqe motors!
[2025-01-15T01:51:43] Matte: only if youre putting in more amps above saturation point
[2025-01-15T01:51:49] Patrick: They efficient how possible 🙂
[2025-01-15T01:52:01] 'lekrsu': Pushing current to just reduce bemf instead of generating torque. And if you have an error it'll fry everything.
[2025-01-15T01:52:39] 'lekrsu': Increase your supply voltage before pushing field weakening.
[2025-01-15T01:52:53] Smart Repair: Yes 😀
[2025-01-15T01:53:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ok now I'm 72v (20s) and Bigger motors Maybe I'll try only phase amps again
[2025-01-15T01:55:05] Matte: in case of lower kv motor, it has enough torque in this case, so there is no downside to field weakening. When it comes to misconfiguration, any kind of a mistake can fry everything
[2025-01-15T01:55:28] Matte: monster
[2025-01-15T01:55:40] 'lekrsu': Increased current draw, decreased range.
[2025-01-15T01:55:58] Matte: yeah so? as if 90% of builds here are practical
[2025-01-15T01:56:19] Smart Repair: I've asked everywhere and no one has been able to help me. Can one of you recommend a narrow brake caliper? The distance between the disc and the rim must not exceed 16mm. A maximum of 15mm would be better.
[2025-01-15T01:56:35] 'lekrsu': Practicality is the way to go.
[2025-01-15T01:56:47] Matte: this dude spins his wheels if he wants to riding at 50 kmh, i dont think hes worried about losing some range because he wants to go 150kmh
[2025-01-15T01:57:18] Matte: I agree, my build will be practicality first, i dont think practicality is what this dude is about lol
[2025-01-15T01:59:15] Matte: try looking here maybe https://www.ebikekit.com/products/narrow-disc-brake-calipers-f180-r160
[2025-01-15T01:59:32] Matte: they care about those dimensions cause ebike conversion and all

[2025-01-15T09:52:23] Smart Repair: I saw that. That's why I'm asking if you also have the 11" 70h. According to another user, the brake caliper has 16.5mm without the screw
[2025-01-15T09:53:11] Dualtron Achilleus: My 75h is on my scooter yet i will put it this week end and see
[2025-01-15T09:53:48] Smart Repair: I would like to... I have to look, with luck I can make 1mm spacers. Can you confirm that the brake calliper has 16.5mm without a screw between the disc and the rim?
[2025-01-15T09:54:04] Dualtron Achilleus: But there are a lot of different rims on lonnyo
[2025-01-15T09:54:38] Dualtron Achilleus: Spacer is easy found on aliexpress
[2025-01-15T09:55:19] Smart Repair: yes, that's what I meant. The translation is just crap.
[2025-01-15T09:55:23] Dualtron Achilleus: I have way more space than you i dont have this issues

My goal is to have fast 0-60mph times, and doing rear wheel burn with the torque haha
[2025-01-15T10:27:14] Dualtron Achilleus: My current stock build look like this
[2025-01-15T10:27:25] Smart Repair: 350A phase should be possible with the 250 ubox. Go slowly and keep an eye on the FET temperature

[2025-01-15T18:20:00] JPPL: Project rises but Kelly no field weak, could get more and between tests decided to go Vesc, new world arrived
[2025-01-15T18:21:13] JPPL: Teverun also had lunched it's supreme, I was one of the first batch, original no problems, just few tweaks, amazing power from factory
[2025-01-15T18:21:37] JPPL: Then came 7260 and I thought I could match a 11x setup on teverun

[2025-01-15T20:02:12] Jason: mmm tjny
[2025-01-15T20:02:44] Matte: @Dualtron_Achillleus @albeeeerttttt yeah I know it was a stupid question on the surface, but I know how it usually goes. It's never guaranteed even tho numbers fit.
[2025-01-15T20:07:53] Yamal: 20s.. :(
[2025-01-15T20:21:06] Jason: I wonder where's shunt
[2025-01-15T20:21:23] Jason: <photos/photo_20887@15-01-2025_20-21-23.jpg>
[2025-01-15T20:21:26] Jason: anyway good design
[2025-01-15T20:21:36] Jason: very good for adding capacitance
[2025-01-15T20:21:52] Jason: ah found shunt
[2025-01-15T20:21:53] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jason has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-15T20:27:35] Yamal: This is like Mp2 right
[2025-01-15T20:30:55] Jason: but way better
[2025-01-15T20:31:19] Jason: <photos/photo_20888@15-01-2025_20-31-19.jpg>
[2025-01-15T20:31:25] Jason: cap right close to the mosfet
[2025-01-15T20:31:30] Jason: epic
[2025-01-15T20:32:28] Yamal: How your mp2 600A going..?
[2025-01-15T20:34:14] Jason: not sure
[2025-01-15T20:35:14] Yamal: any coffee at weped cafe?
[2025-01-15T21:05:26] David: Hi guys Can any one suggest me a 4 piston hydraulic brake that will match for scooter's front? Almost all brakes i saw, tube goes to left side while I need it to go right
[2025-01-15T21:06:52] David: For example this is the left sided tube While I need a "mirrored" version Rotating the caliper won't help as it much wider on that side plus the screw holes goes into motor side and not "outside"
[2025-01-15T21:11:01] haku: i have that on jetson. i like it.
[2025-01-15T21:11:07] haku: better than zoom
[2025-01-15T21:13:24] haku: depends on the scooter. some maguras ive read you can mount right side
[2025-01-15T21:15:55] haku: right side brakes i believe is zoom and that one on the vsett forgot the name
[2025-01-15T21:16:52] haku: nutts
[2025-01-15T21:16:53] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-15T21:17:51] Andrei Albert: You can do banjo swap on magura
[2025-01-15T21:17:54] Andrei Albert: And hope too
[2025-01-15T21:18:27] Andrei Albert: <photos/photo_20890@15-01-2025_21-18-27.jpg>
[2025-01-15T21:38:37] David: It's rear which I've got already(same as picture I've sent)
[2025-01-15T21:38:47] David: I need tube go to right and not left
[2025-01-15T21:38:52] David: <video_file>
[2025-01-15T21:38:58] David: This video explain a bit better
[2025-01-15T21:40:04] David: Sorry for my bad Russian accent 😅
[2025-01-15T21:40:04] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Daniel has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-15T21:40:35] Andrei Albert: Where is the bleeding port?
[2025-01-15T21:42:56] David: <photos/photo_20891@15-01-2025_21-42-56.jpg>
[2025-01-15T21:43:38] Andrei Albert: Shit its too small
[2025-01-15T21:44:29] David: Yap
[2025-01-15T21:45:52] David: Maybe you can suggest something else? It worst I'll buy magura But I'm trying to be cheap Cuz this scooter will be sold once I'm finishing all setups haha
[2025-01-15T21:46:04] Andrei Albert: They didnt think about that:))
[2025-01-15T21:46:26] Andrei Albert: Look for a sh magura
[2025-01-15T21:46:30] Andrei Albert: They cheap
[2025-01-15T21:47:07] David: This is the second model I've got as well The one I'm holding on my hand in the video
[2025-01-15T21:47:34] David: So maybe the rear port can be used?
[2025-01-15T21:47:44] David: <photos/photo_20893@15-01-2025_21-47-44.jpg>
[2025-01-15T21:50:40] David: P.s. can you send me your front caliper?
[2025-01-15T21:52:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I have the same one I think

[2025-01-15T21:54:06] Andrei Albert: I have banjo there too
[2025-01-15T21:54:34] Andrei Albert: Another cheaper option its to use spacer to axle and brake disck
[2025-01-15T21:57:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: That's what I'm doing to space out the disk
[2025-01-15T22:16:08] Слава Радченко: Yes, I know. I won’t use halls. It’s test whell and I want testing vesc with out halls
[2025-01-15T22:24:37] JPPL: Space in or space out, each setup needs personal tweaks

[2025-01-15T23:54:46] Luis: Hi to all. Why my mks 84100hp Vesc works nice with an 36v battery but not even stay on if I Connect a 48v (13s) battery? It briefly turns the Blue Light and immediatly shuts the controller
[2025-01-15T23:56:01] Luis: It makes some spark, could the ESC being protecting against it???

[2025-01-16T00:32:52] haku: first time ive seen this one
[2025-01-16T00:33:04] haku: check this out. full self driving.
[2025-01-16T00:48:24] Noname: What's that a bus?
[2025-01-16T00:51:09] GABE: is that the Tesla car?
[2025-01-16T00:54:15] haku: no idea. it has no driver
[2025-01-16T00:54:46] haku: today i do my own investigations.
[2025-01-16T01:00:34] Noname: There ya go, act weird around the building with a recent terror attack 😆
[2025-01-16T01:06:53] 'lekrsu': There's a cop in the picture😁
[2025-01-16T01:22:33] NetworkDir: So you can't connect vesc tool ? Do you make resistor mod for ignition?
[2025-01-16T01:23:40] NetworkDir: XD
[2025-01-16T01:28:54] Noname: Idk looks sunny and warm there
[2025-01-16T01:29:08] Noname: Freezing my tits off here

[2025-01-16T01:48:34] haku: we protect our state monument thats why lots of cops. i will answer the call if i have too. wepoorman will find these woke criminals desicrating my city
[2025-01-16T07:14:27] Yamal: You are in Paris
[2025-01-16T07:14:31] Luis: No I cant. The board is shutdown. Resistor mod is the anti spark? No I dont have it
[2025-01-16T07:22:47] Luis: Do the Vesc logs internally any fault code history that i can read when Connected with the 36v battery?
[2025-01-16T07:29:02] Andrei Albert: Get a 360
[2025-01-16T07:29:10] Andrei Albert: Worthhh the priceee

[2025-01-16T07:50:08] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): You forget the most important one:
[2025-01-16T08:06:02] Yamal: Apart from the many problems that there are with this controller, I did not include it in the list mainly because I heard a long time ago that flipsky had stopped belonging to "vesc" due to the cessation of payments for certain licenses or I don't know what to call it linked sometimes
[2025-01-16T08:09:23] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Thats just Chinese beeing Chinese and just rip off stuff.
[2025-01-16T08:17:33] Yamal: Winter is the perfect time to take a vacation to a warm country and return in spring......
[2025-01-16T08:21:33] Andrei Albert: If u have money
[2025-01-16T08:22:58] Yamal: The heat and good weather is ideal and even more so when you drive an e-scooter every day of the year.
[2025-01-16T08:24:54] Yamal: Any time is good to go out for a ride or do a few kilometers, few clothes, cells at ideal temperature for greater performance, pretty girls with light clothing (this doesn't leave here, it kills me) in short, all the advantages
[2025-01-16T08:26:19] Yamal: By the way, it is not something impossible, it is a matter of proposing it.
[2025-01-16T08:34:14] Luis: Will use a tabletop PSU to increase gradually the input voltage to try to troubleshoot
[2025-01-16T08:34:30] Yamal: If I was going to go to Australia willingly now, I would get a scooter with 50/60ah and enjoy!!!
[2025-01-16T08:34:49] Luis: Starting at 12.5 v all the way until 60v

[2025-01-16T09:01:08] Yamal: will be hallucinating with your e-scooter
[2025-01-16T09:06:36] Yamal: By the way, I just remembered, what is the top speed of your friend with ubox on the Thunder and the watts that that e-scooter handles? the one from 70h/22/3 that Drei reviews? I ask you because it has more or less my configuration.
[2025-01-16T09:07:04] Yamal: The true like you see..
[2025-01-16T09:07:14] Andrei Albert: Have you go to him to show mine😆
[2025-01-16T09:07:29] Andrei Albert: I tested it and it was 119kmh
[2025-01-16T09:07:45] Yamal: Kw ?
[2025-01-16T09:07:52] Yamal: It’s your friend
[2025-01-16T09:08:14] Andrei Albert: To instead of you i wanted to write
[2025-01-16T09:08:32] Andrei Albert: About 30 I think
[2025-01-16T09:08:43] Yamal: How ..?
[2025-01-16T09:09:27] Andrei Albert: 220A batt per controller
[2025-01-16T09:09:38] Yamal: Wouh
[2025-01-16T09:09:49] Yamal: He it’s 9p right
[2025-01-16T09:09:51] Andrei Albert: No problems still working
[2025-01-16T09:09:53] Andrei Albert: Yes

[2025-01-16T09:10:07] Andrei Albert: P45
[2025-01-16T09:10:11] Yamal: Nice
[2025-01-16T09:10:12] Andrei Albert: Like mine
[2025-01-16T09:10:23] Yamal: My nominal it’s 350A
[2025-01-16T09:10:38] Yamal: Like i no go up 150A per controller
[2025-01-16T09:10:45] Yamal: I don’t know ..
[2025-01-16T09:50:51] Andrei Albert: It’s short time the peak
[2025-01-16T09:50:55] Andrei Albert: Și why not
[2025-01-16T09:51:08] Andrei Albert: I have mines at 170

[2025-01-16T17:14:04] Yamal: Better telegram than TikTok
[2025-01-16T17:15:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: He doesn't want bro u have TikTok no?
[2025-01-16T17:15:15] Yamal: Don’t have , only telegram
[2025-01-16T17:16:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Then we wait for who does
[2025-01-16T17:18:55] Yamal: What electronics does it have?
[2025-01-16T17:25:48] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: He can't connect vesc to PC for some reason
[2025-01-16T17:26:02] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I asked what does PC show/tell him
[2025-01-16T17:38:34] haku: whats this. proffessor BV or CEO BV
[2025-01-16T17:40:10] haku: rumor has it has 2 surrons to get swole and do projects over here boy. one for each arm
[2025-01-16T17:56:34] francois schempers: <video_file>
[2025-01-16T17:56:54] francois schempers: project started 😁💪
[2025-01-16T18:07:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: do u think it's a smart idea to get speed motor for front and torque rear and then you get acceleration and speed ?
[2025-01-16T18:14:59] Noname: Rear pushes front then front drags rear so no extra really.
[2025-01-16T18:24:32] Pandalgns: And you put more voltage at the back and more amps at the front 🤪🤪🤪
[2025-01-16T18:26:12] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I always more rear then front in everything fw battery amps and phase amps
[2025-01-16T18:26:41] Yamal: Finally 😭
[2025-01-16T18:43:35] Pandalgns: I have a problem with that, the front engine skids too much, I have 300a phase set on each engine and I was thinking of putting a little more at the rear and a little less at the front but I don't know if the difference in torque will negatively affect the performance and apart from That's it, with the ak script for the qss4 display I don't know if it would work for me to set different phase amperages or if it sets the same thing for each motor
[2025-01-16T18:47:38] Yamal: You can carry different phase amperes in each motor without problem, as far as I know, by the way, what a beast, right? Pass data from vesc tool so we can see how those controllers are doing, by the way, put the weight on the handlebars so it doesn't skid xD
[2025-01-16T18:49:47] Pandalgns: Skids the same even if I stand on the handlebars 😂😂
[2025-01-16T18:49:59] Yamal: 😂
[2025-01-16T18:51:46] Pandalgns: At the moment it is going very well, it has a lot of torque and a lot of speed, more than I expected, although less than what I want since it is with the original 60v battery and apart from the front motor I have it without halls because it gives me failure reading of the hall in vesc and they don't work for me, I don't know if because they have been damaged or because I have connected them wrong, in any case I was a little disappointed that it barely reaches 9kw
[2025-01-16T18:54:17] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_20902@16-01-2025_18-54-17.jpg>
[2025-01-16T18:54:53] Pandalgns: The maximum speed is due to the front wheel that skidded
[2025-01-16T18:55:31] Pandalgns: I didn't get to test maximum speed since I was going without lights at night and with everything set up in a hurry to do tests 😂
[2025-01-16T20:14:36] haku: getting swole and projects. yea buddy

[2025-01-17T07:57:55] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-17T09:35:57] haku: most powerful you say
[2025-01-17T09:38:53] Yamal: …
[2025-01-17T09:43:53] Yamal: these people like to say hyper scooter a lot
[2025-01-17T09:49:00] haku: i think its the same guy who made the fastest scooter in the world video
[2025-01-17T09:54:47] Yamal: I took out the Turkish Langfeite scooter, and then in a comment I put the link to the red rage scooter, but it didn't say anything xD

[2025-01-17T09:57:48] Yamal: wepoor is the best miniscoterbike in the entire American continent
[2025-01-17T10:46:31] Maximus Brokus: Sup
[2025-01-17T10:46:43] Maximus Brokus: Whats the safest option to power up a vesc?
[2025-01-17T10:47:33] Maximus Brokus: I have this one here visually inspected it meassured some points but nothing to see. When I plug it into a batt it makes some unbareable noise
[2025-01-17T10:48:00] Maximus Brokus: Some 12v 1A PSU is enough?
[2025-01-17T10:54:03] Mirono escooters: Cc psu
[2025-01-17T10:54:22] Mirono escooters: With 30-50ma current control. If something faulty, won't burn
[2025-01-17T10:54:54] Maximus Brokus: Hmmmm
[2025-01-17T10:55:06] Maximus Brokus: Shit cost money
[2025-01-17T10:55:10] Maximus Brokus: Me not much money
[2025-01-17T10:55:12] Maximus Brokus: Always :D
[2025-01-17T10:59:31] Maximus Brokus: Too bad I dont know anyone near by who would have that
[2025-01-17T10:59:32] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Maximus has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-17T11:00:13] Mirono escooters: A cheap adjustable psu +-40€
[2025-01-17T11:00:16] Mirono escooters: Diy 10€
[2025-01-17T11:21:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well normaly ,you pre charge before any connection if connection is not antispark by default What Networkdir ment is a diy way to turn on and off
[2025-01-17T11:37:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: there can be a protection,but no experience with mks from my side ,but i would not plug something in like that. Normaly you set your vesc work range up to S Check what your vesc can do to turn on ,if only factory way was antispark switch , Than there is a maybe that you find Diy solution In general chat there's a how to in the pinned list, but if i am right that's for 75100 ,but @NetworkDir may know a solution ,my guess is that's why he asked up
[2025-01-17T13:12:39] GABE: I've seen of the Xiaomi charger PSU able to be adjusted, do you think it's safe? Apparently up to 17s is possible before the Potentiometer is maxed.
[2025-01-17T13:13:19] GABE: Seen YouTube vids .
[2025-01-17T13:19:52] NetworkDir: Mostly on lower voltage should don't work but on his situation doesn't turn on 48V Maybe hardware issue or bad setup
[2025-01-17T13:22:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I never seen such, but we are always well prepared
[2025-01-17T13:35:50] Mirono escooters: Bweh, 13s max
[2025-01-17T13:36:09] Mirono escooters: And still, not a proper psu if u wanna test vescs and stuff. You wanna be able to set and read values
[2025-01-17T13:36:10] Luis: what options you sugest to precharge?
[2025-01-17T13:44:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well for now an xt90 antispark would do the trick ,but that's bot a turn on solution
[2025-01-17T13:48:01] Maximus Brokus: Does Ubox Lite has enough juice to charge a phone when there is nothing else on the 5v?
[2025-01-17T13:54:22] Finn: Dc dc from ignition port and into a buck converter
[2025-01-17T13:54:40] 'lekrsu': Batt voltage in ignition?
[2025-01-17T13:54:43] Patrick: Ali 12V dcdc fits in G30 pole too
[2025-01-17T13:55:52] Finn: Can you draw large currents through the B+ port at the Ignition port?
[2025-01-17T13:56:34] Finn: 1A already enough for phone charger
[2025-01-17T13:57:13] Finn: Put 12V on my 75150 and to a phone charger. Even fastcharging
[2025-01-17T13:57:38] 'lekrsu': Sounds sketchy
[2025-01-17T13:58:07] Maximus Brokus: when there is nothing else on the 5v
[2025-01-17T13:58:25] Finn: <photos/photo_20916@17-01-2025_13-58-25.jpg>
[2025-01-17T13:58:40] 'lekrsu': Exactly what he said.
[2025-01-17T13:58:41] Finn: Worked fine
[2025-01-17T13:59:14] 'lekrsu': I mean 'fast charging' is 15W and beyond.
[2025-01-17T14:01:22] Finn: On lite no exposed 12V port
[2025-01-17T14:01:54] Finn: Thats why im asking if maybe the ignition port can be used for that purpose as it switches vbatt
[2025-01-17T14:02:47] Finn: From this into this

[2025-01-17T17:15:28] Unknown: есть какой нибудь спидометр под vesc? желательно на Ali и очень дешевый, нету желания копаться и ебаться с ардуино 🙁
[2025-01-17T17:16:31] haku: nice. they will not pull you over?
[2025-01-17T17:16:46] haku: on a mtb frame
[2025-01-17T17:17:09] Unknown: )))
[2025-01-17T17:17:23] 'lekrsu': Keep it to English here
[2025-01-17T17:19:04] Unknown: I have telegram translates everything, I read everything in native language, I threw the screenshot)))) is there any speedometer for vesc? preferably on ali and very cheap, no desire to dig and fuck with arduino. 🙁
[2025-01-17T17:20:57] 'lekrsu': The rest of us shouldn't have to pay for telegram or use custom clients. It's in the group description.
[2025-01-17T17:22:55] Unknown: I'd like to hear something about the speedometer.
[2025-01-17T17:24:05] Unknown: kk
[2025-01-17T17:25:29] 'lekrsu': A Xiaomi dash would only cost a couple bucks but might not be perfect for other scooter frames. There's the m365 lisp repo on GitHub to make that compatible.
[2025-01-17T17:35:16] Noname: 49cc and a bike frame with padals is the law here anyway. Might get questioned but nothing they can do unless reckless driving or somehow speeding
[2025-01-17T17:39:20] haku: i see. actuall ebike guy his mtb has a nd961800 and a huge battery. you seen that monstrosity. big balls that guy for running no bms.
[2025-01-17T17:41:01] haku: dude so passionate about that bike he never upgraded frame just parts getting bigger. props to him
[2025-01-17T17:46:38] haku: 90ah p45battery i think.
[2025-01-17T17:52:50] GABE: cars on the other hand just need motor mounts, even gears can be kept, doesnt matter.
[2025-01-17T17:53:12] GABE: its a bit stupid but it works, if it works dont touch it.
[2025-01-17T17:54:29] haku: electric car layout will be completly different. thats a different beast to build too
[2025-01-17T17:54:47] GABE: builders put the cell in the trunk
[2025-01-17T17:54:59] GABE: some builders also put it in the back 2 seats but i find that silly.
[2025-01-17T17:55:12] GABE: changing it to a 2seat
[2025-01-17T17:55:20] GABE: i mean,, works if you have no children?
[2025-01-17T17:55:29] haku: weight distribution has to be considered aswell.
[2025-01-17T17:55:41] GABE: Assumed
[2025-01-17T17:55:45] GABE: Good observation tho
[2025-01-17T17:56:14] GABE: can put a cell where the engine was and a cell in the trunk
[2025-01-17T17:56:18] GABE: perf'

[2025-01-17T17:57:41] GABE: we need a car board based on vesc on god
[2025-01-17T17:57:46] haku: does it even have gears? never seen one with it. only the porche
[2025-01-17T17:57:57] GABE: I think they keep them on.
[2025-01-17T17:58:07] GABE: No downside just not needed at all
[2025-01-17T17:58:11] GABE: but if its already there fuck it
[2025-01-17T17:58:19] GABE: pain and tears getting rid of it
[2025-01-17T17:58:21] haku: one day i will fullfil my destiny and make one
[2025-01-17T17:58:32] GABE: its plausible
[2025-01-17T17:59:12] GABE: vesc can so work even if another form of transfer is used that arent MOSFETS. everything should be kept intact
[2025-01-17T17:59:24] GABE: code wise, imo
[2025-01-17T17:59:27] haku: i will make one dedicated to the realest vesclords
[2025-01-17T17:59:28] GABE: talking out my ass tho

[2025-01-17T18:22:14] haku: california never been about freedom. but laws will be laws
[2025-01-17T18:22:55] haku: that "W" governor doesent even know wtf hes doing. look at the children under 11 laws
[2025-01-17T18:24:03] haku: W stands for west side btw
[2025-01-17T18:24:09] haku: not to offend anyone

[2025-01-17T18:27:10] haku: i dont blame the surron boys not at all
[2025-01-17T18:27:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well since of speeds somehow you need to put these under laws
[2025-01-17T18:28:15] haku: agreed with that. there has to be laws but cant be too extreme

[2025-01-17T23:09:10] haku: what are you talking about. i actually have a trans dog. thats legal in america
[2025-01-17T23:09:57] haku: anyways my dog always there to blame. good to keep one around. very loyal
[2025-01-17T23:10:57] haku: why are you so offended im an ally. i love my dog
[2025-01-17T23:11:44] Matte: anyways finally prepared mystery cells i received without wraps or insulators, they measure 15 mOhm internal resistance so i approximate 10A continuous and 30A peak discharge rate until temperature limit.
[2025-01-17T23:12:09] haku: good for you. do some projects and get swole.
[2025-01-17T23:17:12] haku: why are you towing me Noname. what did i do?
[2025-01-17T23:29:58] haku: look at this group of 3 wheelers.
[2025-01-17T23:31:14] Patrick: Thats why i never pay tronic in future, i have 6controllers, only 1work as it should. Have 12spintend, they all work fine, stay cool, much better accurate. They can come out with what they want, they not help me, and not change the article. Very very bad company 😕
[2025-01-17T23:33:49] Mirono escooters: Esp fukd then
[2025-01-17T23:33:53] Mirono escooters: I'll try usbc
[2025-01-17T23:34:36] Yamal: Which Tronic you have ?
[2025-01-17T23:37:02] haku: we in the country now boys
[2025-01-17T23:37:36] Yamal: Nice view
[2025-01-17T23:40:37] Patrick: 250r, i know the x12 should be better, but the company is very bad! Two 250R not worked from stock, one bluetooth not work, one stop work after disconect and reconect battery. One one canbus not work. This one what work only give me 97kmh, and have a very bad duty cycle curve, unknown problem. Did the setup new 20times, nothing helped. Then i connect a spintend 150A and what i can say, first test ride 113kmh. At tronic also the voltage was off 1,2v wrong. And only what company said was:“we not repair controllers, and we not know what you did wrong.“ I did close to 20vesc conversstions, and i know what i doing, they company very VERY bad!
[2025-01-17T23:44:10] Yamal: fame long recognized with the 250 and 250r,,,, without further ado.! The x12 is giving very good expectations, new construction, new engineer and one of the best mosfets on the market
[2025-01-17T23:44:59] Patrick: I know, but i do not support a company wich absolute not care about people. 😁
[2025-01-17T23:45:19] Patrick: With Spintend you write them and they help very much 😇
[2025-01-17T23:45:42] Yamal: Spintend solution
[2025-01-17T23:46:08] Yamal: Power solution for you .! XD
[2025-01-17T23:54:51] Noname: How dare you, thats a Dodge truck
[2025-01-18T00:02:31] haku: why did you build this desert igloo. wtf.

[2025-01-18T00:33:37] Noname: Ooh, got caught being a bad boy
[2025-01-18T00:42:40] haku: he said i can ride my "ebike" on the highway. i said sir its a scooter
[2025-01-18T00:43:11] haku: almost confiscated it.
[2025-01-18T00:43:43] haku: its a park ranger that got me. local police doesnt care
[2025-01-18T00:46:11] haku: he was cool about it because he said people on surrons usually run and they ride in groups. i told him sir its a scooter and he said you still cant ride it on the highway. and i said now i know. then he said heres a 130 federal ticket. wtf
[2025-01-18T00:47:00] haku: ill have my friend donald take care of it
[2025-01-18T00:47:00] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-18T01:16:20] Noname: Saying scooter wasn't a good idea. Need registration for that. It's an "ebike"
[2025-01-18T01:18:01] haku: oh. he doesnt even know the rules. he said its. grey area
[2025-01-18T01:18:31] Noname: Most cops don't. It's not a high priority
[2025-01-18T01:19:35] haku: this one is park ranger. he doesnt have anything to do but chase yogi bear
[2025-01-18T01:19:44] Noname: We've had cops say keep it on the bike trail while others say can't ride on bike trail in the same day
[2025-01-18T01:20:09] Noname: Your yogi bear now
[2025-01-18T01:20:09] haku: yes this one said cant be on the highway lmao. obviously
[2025-01-18T01:20:56] haku: ill own up to my mistake. play stupid games win stupid prices
[2025-01-18T01:22:05] haku: good thing he didnt take it. he threatened me at first he said your not going home with that thing. he said do you have any weapons on you. i said ofcourse not im an ally
[2025-01-18T01:22:11] Noname: Caused such a ruckus with all that traffic
[2025-01-18T01:22:26] haku: i was going 65mph speed limit
[2025-01-18T01:22:37] haku: didnt even balls to walls

[2025-01-18T11:46:55] Yamal: I thought you had said before that you were going to modify a Victor with a long box
[2025-01-18T11:47:04] Yamal: Yes why?
[2025-01-18T11:48:02] Yamal: You have rage mechanic and RFP performance in your country ,, Ambrosini for what ? XD
[2025-01-18T11:48:06] Yamal: ^^'

[2025-01-18T11:49:57] Dualtron Achilleus: I say this cuz its spain

[2025-01-18T11:50:34] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Dualtron has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-18T11:51:25] Yamal: Nice !!!
[2025-01-18T11:51:55] Yamal: 11 “ engines right ?
[2025-01-18T11:52:19] Yamal: Don’t need to change anything for mount 11” engines
[2025-01-18T11:53:02] Yamal: My long frame for Dt thunder coming from RFP solution xD
[2025-01-18T11:56:37] Dualtron Achilleus: Depend of the engine
[2025-01-18T11:56:46] Dualtron Achilleus: Ho you buy from rfp
[2025-01-18T11:57:05] Dualtron Achilleus: I buy cheap for 100€ xd
[2025-01-18T12:01:35] Yamal: When it arrives I'm going to put it in a glass display case, It will be something unprecedented to have the framework with which the first and second from France won the competition last year, have you stopped to think about this? X)
[2025-01-18T12:04:30] Dualtron Achilleus: Hum
[2025-01-18T12:04:56] Dualtron Achilleus: It’s Just a aluminium dont get it
[2025-01-18T12:05:16] Dualtron Achilleus: You selling you nami for the dualtron?
[2025-01-18T12:07:01] Yamal: In the same way, it is a long story, which begins in Ningbo (China) which is followed by a Red Nami putting an entire country on the ropes in a Valencian circuit in Spain, this day more than one man understood what the word performance, and the 20" penalty was worthless
[2025-01-18T12:07:19] Yamal: Nop start second project
[2025-01-18T12:40:54] GABE: insulate andkapton over
[2025-01-18T12:51:20] GABE: Or big heat shrink over a separator
[2025-01-18T12:51:22] GABE: ez
[2025-01-18T13:00:52] 'lekrsu': Kapton around, then large heatshrink above xt, works quite well ;) Or desolder and redo xD
[2025-01-18T13:01:36] Matte: ofc you would advise someone to do it wrong
[2025-01-18T13:15:55] Yamal: <photos/photo_20938@18-01-2025_13-15-55.jpg>
[2025-01-18T13:36:05] Rose: Hey there Ary, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-01-18T14:04:45] Yamal: https://youtu.be/1o245-L1Yoc?si=4ZBkQQAkO4ZHYrH1
[2025-01-18T14:42:55] Rose: Hey there J, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-01-18T14:46:40] JPPL: Ordered one for 11x ❤️
[2025-01-18T14:47:17] haku: okay sir. what would you advice me. instead of hating on people just contrubute
[2025-01-18T14:48:19] Yamal: man, you don't stop buying high quality things and components, you are living a dream and earthly paradise xD
[2025-01-18T14:49:01] Matte: Kapton has incredibly poor resistance to abrasion and wear. You would never use it as outer layer
[2025-01-18T14:49:55] haku: what is it that you would use then my ally friend?
[2025-01-18T14:50:15] Matte: its great as electrical insulator and stable at wide range of temperature, makes no sense to use it as outside layer
[2025-01-18T14:50:17] JPPL: Its one of my few addictions
[2025-01-18T14:50:56] Matte: dude just needs a centimeter of electrical tape and thats it, no complications. his connector isnt unsoldered or anything, just wrap the exposed part and be done with it
[2025-01-18T14:50:58] haku: ofcourse not for cables. what would you use instead of shrink?
[2025-01-18T14:51:16] haku: exactlt what i was going to do thanks sir
[2025-01-18T14:51:50] Matte: no kapton on the outside, kapton breaks if you sneeze at it
[2025-01-18T14:52:21] haku: if i might ask how many batteries have you built
[2025-01-18T14:52:38] Yamal: Yeah! like mine but it takes a lot of money for all this, I spend my time digging deep in Khazad-dûm
[2025-01-18T14:53:10] Matte: hundreds
[2025-01-18T14:53:39] haku: great. you have photos of these batteries
[2025-01-18T14:53:55] haku: i just want to see
[2025-01-18T14:54:26] Matte: Signed NDA, buyers are huge companies
[2025-01-18T14:54:41] haku: oh i see.
[2025-01-18T14:55:32] haku: im a small balls personal battery maker. i want to learn from the big dawgs
[2025-01-18T14:55:54] haku: photos or it did not happen
[2025-01-18T14:56:09] JPPL: Your setup rocks, modding it's endless as our creativity, it's limited by our finances
[2025-01-18T14:56:37] Matte: Thats cool, i do laser on alu and copper so i dont think you could learn from me anyways
[2025-01-18T14:57:26] haku: fancy stuff. i cut my own copper
[2025-01-18T14:59:50] Andrei Albert: Lets gooooooo
[2025-01-18T15:01:04] Andrei Albert: 100s 2p pack🤣
[2025-01-18T15:02:26] Matte: i obv dont want to share my own photos so ill use public ones, imagine something similar to this
[2025-01-18T15:03:02] haku: thats an actual EV
[2025-01-18T15:03:11] GABE: I don't care, safety is number 1 priority.
[2025-01-18T15:03:12] haku: very cool
[2025-01-18T15:03:16] GABE: Aesthetic is second.
[2025-01-18T15:03:17] GABE: go argue.
[2025-01-18T15:03:51] GABE: Plus some of us have no money for new heatshrnk etc.
[2025-01-18T15:04:13] GABE: Not once have you actually posted something of material use Just contant complaining Anyway, to offtopic.
[2025-01-18T15:04:40] Matte: kapton is 10 times more expensive that heatshrink or electrical tape. As i said, kapton is incredibly weak to mechanical wear. Its like a napkin
[2025-01-18T15:05:10] Matte: if thats the case i at least didnt give bad advice like kapton as outer layer
[2025-01-18T15:06:08] GABE: 10 layers.
[2025-01-18T15:06:20] GABE: assumed
[2025-01-18T15:06:51] GABE: Temporary safety fix @No1Matte
[2025-01-18T15:07:05] GABE: is this real??
[2025-01-18T15:10:32] haku: hes gone haha. can run im in the middle of desert with big rocks. also these rangers dont fuck around. they will chase you even off road haha
[2025-01-18T15:10:45] Andrei Albert: https://hackaday.io/project/164932/gallery#aa6957301b95b335d89132d131c3c771
[2025-01-18T15:10:56] haku: whoa you got one
[2025-01-18T15:10:57] Andrei Albert: Idk honestly,

[2025-01-18T15:11:52] haku: its a real project ask @jamessoderstrom
[2025-01-18T15:14:21] Andrei Albert: Someone did it?
[2025-01-18T15:15:45] haku: no idea. i asked about this controller before. i dont know if anyone used it
[2025-01-18T15:16:47] haku: my question is what about for 6 phase motors. is there a vesc for that. for EV motors
[2025-01-18T15:20:32] Yamal: 40pl and seven controller
[2025-01-18T15:21:02] Andrei Albert: Like the taiwan guys

[2025-01-18T17:43:48] Noname: Comes with MCO for reregistration but also says for off road use only. That's just for atv registration. Need a title to register on road
[2025-01-18T17:44:14] haku: oh thats lame.
[2025-01-18T17:44:25] haku: what is a mco
[2025-01-18T17:44:43] Noname: Manufacturer certificate of origin
[2025-01-18T17:45:20] haku: i didnt know you need to register atv even for offroad. i thought its a free country
[2025-01-18T17:45:33] Noname: On private land
[2025-01-18T17:45:57] Noname: Do whatever
[2025-01-18T17:46:34] haku: oh. what about ultrabee that can be registered as moped?
[2025-01-18T17:47:37] haku: grom vesc conversion would be cool too but thats $$$. and wont do offroad but can be registered
[2025-01-18T17:51:05] haku: https://youtu.be/LhpdjxK0LTc?si=_F0IyKLCrZP5_Sf5

[2025-01-18T18:21:56] haku: i want offroad or road and legal

[2025-01-18T18:24:30] haku: no idea
[2025-01-18T18:25:10] haku: agreed. thats what the cop said. thats a motorcycle your riding not a scooter or ebike.

[2025-01-19T00:15:48] 'lekrsu': I see Ninebots ;)
[2025-01-19T00:18:03] NetworkDir: You can use original display/throttle with vesc it's possible but i think you can't find any public lisp code for Dualtron protocol. anyway maybe aka vsett lisp code works with some modifications i have a dualtron protocol doucments Also i don't recommend buy flipsky/makerbase i advice buy spintend ubox 80100
[2025-01-19T00:18:21] NetworkDir: https://github.com/aka13-404/VSETT-LISP
[2025-01-19T00:20:38] haku: i had to showcase for the boys
[2025-01-19T00:21:20] NetworkDir: Dualtron sniffed protocol and some doucment maybe you need ;)
[2025-01-19T00:21:30] haku: they have all the new "hyper" scooters
[2025-01-19T00:22:16] haku: i was checking this out

[2025-01-19T00:23:36] Yamal: Let race let race
[2025-01-19T00:24:21] luffydnoob: Does this require programing with PC I want to make sure everything works before spending money 😂??
[2025-01-19T00:24:38] haku: nah. gotta be humble first. then assert dominance
[2025-01-19T00:25:03] haku: ive read donalds book.
[2025-01-19T00:25:33] NetworkDir: Yeah need programing lisp & understanding protocol & encryptions
[2025-01-19T00:26:01] haku: ill attend one of thier group rides
[2025-01-19T00:27:17] haku: they also sell pmt
[2025-01-19T00:29:03] haku: i spread the good word of vesc though. as a vesc soldier im obligated to do it

[2025-01-19T01:37:43] haku: hope an affordable display comes out from the boys here
[2025-01-19T01:43:25] haku: emove roadster "worlds fastest" production scooter. i inspected it. its hwameng motor. but it is carbon covers

[2025-01-19T09:13:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Or the 85250 no ? (Like if he wants alternative to the 75200)
[2025-01-19T09:35:25] Unknown: No more brainrot 😭
[2025-01-19T09:36:53] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: For Americans we still have it but still sorry for u
[2025-01-19T09:50:54] Jason: lmao
[2025-01-19T11:43:08] Nawfal: Hey guys
[2025-01-19T11:44:22] Nawfal: I’ve just bought a mks 84100hp and I did al the setup of the motors and the accelerator. But the issue is that the motor doesn’t go above 41km/h. Someone knows why?
[2025-01-19T11:44:47] Nawfal: I’ve already updated to 6.05fw no limit btw
[2025-01-19T11:58:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Filed weakening did u set ?
[2025-01-19T11:58:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also how much motor amps and battery amps
[2025-01-19T12:17:55] GABE: what cell do you have?
[2025-01-19T12:22:38] Nawfal: Nope
[2025-01-19T12:22:59] Nawfal: 90A for the motor and 28A for the battery
[2025-01-19T12:23:07] Nawfal: Because it’s a dual motor
[2025-01-19T12:23:13] 'lekrsu': Which motor? What's your voltage?
[2025-01-19T12:23:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: In my experience small motors no fwk no movement
[2025-01-19T12:23:52] Nawfal: Hm 1000W and 52V 21Ah battery
[2025-01-19T12:24:07] Nawfal: Before the vesc it went 82km/h
[2025-01-19T12:24:16] Nawfal: Riding it 62km/h
[2025-01-19T12:24:35] Nawfal: I tried to put it but no changes appeared
[2025-01-19T12:24:56] 'lekrsu': Wrong motor pole number? Wrong tire size? Is 41 km/h by gps or in air?
[2025-01-19T12:25:07] 'lekrsu': If either of those two arent correct then speed wont be.
[2025-01-19T12:25:29] Nawfal: On air but it doesn’t sound like 80km/h for example
[2025-01-19T12:25:50] Nawfal: I put 254mm and 30 poles
[2025-01-19T12:26:14] Nawfal: I feel like the motor is limited
[2025-01-19T12:26:25] Nawfal: Idk how to explain
[2025-01-19T12:26:57] Nawfal: Could be some wrong connection?
[2025-01-19T12:27:00] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Nawfal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-19T12:28:26] 'lekrsu': Did you count your poles?
[2025-01-19T12:29:51] Nawfal: No but I was told that this motor had 30 poles
[2025-01-19T12:30:03] Nawfal: This could be the problem?
[2025-01-19T12:30:20] Nawfal: Because know in the web I searched and it has 10 pairs of poles
[2025-01-19T12:30:31] Nawfal: These are 20 poles right?
[2025-01-19T12:31:05] 'lekrsu': Short two phases without a vesc and count the ticks by hand for one whole rotation.
[2025-01-19T12:31:32] Nawfal: Okay
[2025-01-19T12:31:46] 'lekrsu': It won't affect your actual speed but rather just the reading.
[2025-01-19T12:32:13] Nawfal: But i think that it isn’t the problem
[2025-01-19T12:32:36] Nawfal: Because when I put more amps or less amps it goes to the same speed
[2025-01-19T12:32:45] Nawfal: I mean it doesn’t increase the speed
[2025-01-19T12:33:22] Nawfal: Even if I put 120A for phase motor
[2025-01-19T12:33:39] Nawfal: It’s like “limited”
[2025-01-19T12:33:39] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Nawfal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-19T12:36:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Firmware issue then
[2025-01-19T12:37:13] NetworkDir: Seems bad hardware (fake shunts/fake power) :) or bad config/setup
[2025-01-19T12:39:26] Pandalgns: look like bad config
[2025-01-19T12:39:40] 'lekrsu': As it should though? Your voltage affects your top speed in air, not the current.
[2025-01-19T12:40:10] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like 75100 I had the same issue
[2025-01-19T12:40:52] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Didn't know those can happen in the 84100 for me it worked perfectly I did 100 kmh on dual
[2025-01-19T12:40:59] Pandalgns: 75100 has a horrible assembly, I had to remove several shunt resistors to make it work "well"
[2025-01-19T12:41:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm not that pro
[2025-01-19T12:41:21] Pandalgns: 😂😂
[2025-01-19T12:41:46] Pandalgns: To be exact, 2 resistances per phase of the 3 that it comes with per phase.
[2025-01-19T12:57:51] GABE: why did you not reply?
[2025-01-19T12:59:59] 'lekrsu': He does not know 🍷
[2025-01-19T13:00:32] GABE: oh my god ive turned into fucking brieru at this point
[2025-01-19T13:01:04] GABE: wonder why only 41kmh then
[2025-01-19T13:39:57] Kenzo Kazan: Is it true that if I have a bigger handlebar, the scoter is going to be more stable?

[2025-01-19T14:35:38] Unknown: If you try to steer in the middle of the handlebar its harder than on the most out position
[2025-01-19T14:37:57] GABE: Stop filling wrong Channel.

[2025-01-19T15:52:11] GABE: vesc power
[2025-01-19T15:53:25] Jan: Lol steering damper
[2025-01-19T16:00:32] Face de Pin Sucé: Small battery 22S9P and shitty G300 in it ^^
[2025-01-19T16:00:54] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Dualtron almost doesn't need a damper also the hack that he did is better then bolting to deck in my experience
[2025-01-19T16:01:04] Face de Pin Sucé: Racing scooter, steering damper is mandatory to be on top But this one has never and will never see any podiums x)
[2025-01-19T16:01:23] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: If that what u call small mine is none existent ahah
[2025-01-19T16:01:37] Jan: But your steering damper has not the purpose to counter speed wobbles i suppose?
[2025-01-19T16:01:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I he a rival company?
[2025-01-19T16:01:45] Face de Pin Sucé: They have longer deck and put only 1P more than what we do in a stock deck x)
[2025-01-19T16:02:03] Face de Pin Sucé: No, it strengthen the direction for curves
[2025-01-19T16:02:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: If vescs outside can do more no ?
[2025-01-19T16:02:41] Face de Pin Sucé: So you delete the parasites movements of direction during very fast angle changes
[2025-01-19T16:03:05] Jan: Then it makes sense to use one
[2025-01-19T16:03:17] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes but what's the point ? We can do 22S11P in stock frame if controllers outside
[2025-01-19T16:03:41] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, I don't like steering dampers, but I have to admit that in racing condition, if you want to be efficient, it is mandatory
[2025-01-19T16:03:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I don't think it's something that can be explained I think you have to try track riding and u'll understand
[2025-01-19T16:04:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: That's what I'm saying hopefully mine will be stable (if I'll set it up correctly)
[2025-01-19T16:08:39] Jan: <animation>
[2025-01-19T16:09:05] Jan: This is how it looks though, im not sure why steering dampers that look like jousting lances are not banned
[2025-01-19T16:12:22] Jan: Imagine someone falls and the next spears the helmet down with his damper

[2025-01-20T17:30:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: You might be right but ull get in trouble
[2025-01-20T17:32:45] haku: the world will go back to normalcy again. there was a time when all colors and all religions or non faith worshipers were united against the wokes. we all believed in the same thing 2 genders only.
[2025-01-20T17:33:22] haku: establishment politicians have divided us

[2025-01-20T18:44:54] Dualtron Achilleus: Why you say g300 is shitty
[2025-01-20T18:44:54] Dualtron Achilleus: Low cooling?
[2025-01-20T18:44:54] Dualtron Achilleus: Or promoting 3shul
[2025-01-20T19:04:18] Yamal: I think the stock g300 has cooling problems, and a modification to its case or something is necessary.
[2025-01-20T19:20:19] JPPL: Will be?

[2025-01-20T19:22:46] Face de Pin Sucé: Amazing shot
[2025-01-20T19:24:43] Face de Pin Sucé: No modifications possible, those are 18fets, good for the streets, but when you start pushing them, then overheat
[2025-01-20T19:24:51] Face de Pin Sucé: Very low cooling possibility
[2025-01-20T19:25:22] Face de Pin Sucé: Do I know you IRL ?
[2025-01-20T19:25:51] Face de Pin Sucé: It is, overheat faster than any 12fets IMS, which is sad for a 18fets x)

[2025-01-20T19:45:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So u suggest go for ? (And don't say 3chull I'm yet to rob the local bank)
[2025-01-20T19:46:41] Dualtron Achilleus: 85 250 is good for the price
[2025-01-20T19:47:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm waiting for another 75200 but as it looks it's probably lost in the mail so I'm thinking about the 85/250 or 150 I'm not sure
[2025-01-20T19:47:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also do u think I can mix vescs with can ?
[2025-01-20T19:48:11] Dualtron Achilleus: Can work i guess bit not sur
[2025-01-20T19:48:47] Dualtron Achilleus: Or just two throttle
[2025-01-20T19:50:54] Face de Pin Sucé: Okay ☺️
[2025-01-20T19:51:36] Face de Pin Sucé: C350 if you want 22S and true 400A phase fully working If you are more on budget, Spintend 85 250
[2025-01-20T19:52:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No communication is more efficient
[2025-01-20T19:53:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm on 20s so no point to spend more money on features I can't use
[2025-01-20T19:53:41] Dualtron Achilleus: 85 250 can go 350 i guess
[2025-01-20T19:54:23] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like im not going to split throttle connection between vescs
[2025-01-20T19:54:39] Dualtron Achilleus: As you want
[2025-01-20T19:55:11] Dualtron Achilleus: Having two throttle good for turning fast
[2025-01-20T19:55:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm on 60h there is a low limit
[2025-01-20T19:55:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I already have 2 (one for brake)
[2025-01-20T20:02:26] Dualtron Achilleus: 60h hum need huge cooling
[2025-01-20T20:06:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: For motor ?
[2025-01-20T20:06:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Just push whatever I safely can

[2025-01-20T20:12:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: C350 200a battery my idk how much exactly my battery can give but its not 200 per side
[2025-01-20T20:19:52] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 72/36 lishen 21700la 35a discharge per cell can give me like 220a safe and 110 per vesc and that without fwk so no need to run a 200a vesc in 100a is just waste of potential for me
[2025-01-20T20:24:21] haku: one might ask. pardon me sir what are you doing on this special day. my answer to that is we do what we do on mondays. getting swole and doing projects.

[2025-01-22T11:37:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: In this vid they are bright because I put more LEDs in the tub itself but they are glitching because it's not the same type of LEDs (all the LEDs connected together to sync)

[2025-01-22T16:59:26] Jason: I wear full face and follow road laws
[2025-01-22T16:59:34] Jason: but technically my scoot can't drive on road
[2025-01-22T16:59:51] Jason: fuck dumbass laws that contradicts each other
[2025-01-22T17:00:57] Jason: law : pevs that go faster than 25kph is classified on different category needs license plate actual : nono we can't put license plate on electric scooter go away
[2025-01-22T17:00:58] haku: same with me. there real criminals that cops worry about. but i guess highways are off limit now 😭
[2025-01-22T17:01:40] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-01-22T17:01:54] Jason: yeah highways are not rly for scooters
[2025-01-22T17:01:56] Jason: imo
[2025-01-22T17:02:16] Jason: even if I can go 100+ I'd stay off the highway
[2025-01-22T17:06:15] haku: agreed. highway is a place for vehicles with plates. i was pushing the limits of my freedom. its so unsafe for little dinky scooter bikes on the highway anyway
[2025-01-22T17:06:33] Jason: id love to see you doing top speed runs on track
[2025-01-22T17:07:02] haku: when i can afford the track fee sure

[2025-01-22T19:58:26] Yamal: This means that only 2 hens are laying out of the 3 that are there
[2025-01-22T19:58:54] haku: its the same race hens? why are some brown and some white?
[2025-01-22T19:59:10] Yamal: the pedals?
[2025-01-22T19:59:30] haku: so i own a scooter then

[2025-01-22T20:04:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Don't like butter

[2025-01-22T20:10:08] Yamal: One solution
[2025-01-22T20:11:50] Yamal: I usually make them with olive oil, scrambled, fried or grilled.
[2025-01-22T20:12:29] haku: you make your own butter? what? how?
[2025-01-22T20:13:38] Yamal: No
[2025-01-22T20:13:47] Yamal: I say about cooking

[2025-01-23T01:48:32] haku: in eu do they have water fountain designated for dogs?
[2025-01-23T01:55:05] haku: howcome the wepoor i can ride no hands easily and the jetson its very difficult. is it because of the weight?
[2025-01-23T02:08:30] Happy Giraffe: @Bradhaku You heard the Bambu news? Or maybe it was already talked here
[2025-01-23T02:10:56] haku: yes james posted it. or is there a new one?
[2025-01-23T02:11:25] haku: i just use bambu software. idk nothing else

[2025-01-23T03:55:27] haku: also its only using 200 bat/300 phase. wtf unlike last time 250/300

[2025-01-23T06:42:37] Yamal: but what exactly happened
[2025-01-23T06:43:52] haku: just riding with my dog very very slowly. then dicided to gun it on the last street. 1 second in it died. bad luck or stupid setttings
[2025-01-23T06:44:56] Yamal: :(
[2025-01-23T06:45:20] Yamal: were your temperatures correct?
[2025-01-23T06:45:34] haku: yes. vesc was very cold
[2025-01-23T06:45:52] haku: i was riding at walking speeds with my dog
[2025-01-23T06:46:19] haku: last time it happened inwas with my dog too. i think its his fault. gadam trans dog
[2025-01-23T06:46:38] Yamal: That's strange, I don't think that because of your configuration you were at the "extreme" limit of your electronics.
[2025-01-23T06:46:51] Yamal: 200/300 okee
[2025-01-23T06:46:55] Yamal: Very sad
[2025-01-23T06:47:28] haku: maybe. i have a spare poweratage. ill try again
[2025-01-23T06:48:45] haku: i think for these motors and weight of vehicle 18fet would be ideal. the tires are heavy af
[2025-01-23T06:49:35] Yamal: I think weight is not a problem
[2025-01-23T06:50:30] Yamal: Time for Tronic x12?
[2025-01-23T06:50:59] haku: if i win lottery or black jack streak
[2025-01-23T06:51:41] Yamal: you can try to save..
[2025-01-23T06:52:41] haku: its always then front motor vesc too
[2025-01-23T06:53:43] haku: anyone have a size comparison of the x12 and the 85250? @roscheeee
[2025-01-23T07:39:12] Lieven L.: Yes
[2025-01-23T07:49:14] Lieven L.: Mostly steering geometry. It's the same reason why modern downhill focused mountain bikes are so hard to ride hands free.

[2025-01-23T12:55:04] Mirono escooters: Could cause a spike but it should handle that
[2025-01-23T12:57:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I had couple of vescs that died from battery cut off
[2025-01-23T12:57:29] 'lekrsu': 10 seconds to reach max current. why?
[2025-01-23T12:57:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like I hit max amps in bms and click dead
[2025-01-23T12:57:48] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Acceleration
[2025-01-23T12:58:04] 'lekrsu': It'll have less acceleration. I prefer zero.
[2025-01-23T13:02:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What do u guys say if I have the space and scared from vesc dying what other controller to go for ?(And not nuc/asi)
[2025-01-23T13:04:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: That is powerful enough to replace 75200
[2025-01-23T13:10:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like tbh the plan is if those die (which is very probable) I'll go for better more expensive vescs but if those die I'll try Kelly or som else
[2025-01-23T13:17:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: For 350$. only 45a continues ? That shit
[2025-01-23T13:21:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: That's based on asi they have one of the worst price to performance ratio

[2025-01-23T14:36:04] Lieven L.: They are stable as hell in terms of riding. But they are hard to ride hands free.
[2025-01-23T15:02:13] JPPL: For now as battery still making, I have original teverun supreme battery, so there's a few space at front, a put them parallel each other side down, no heatsink whatever
[2025-01-23T15:02:59] Lieven L.: Yeah due to the slack steering angle the wheel is somewhat trying to go left or right if you have no resistance to the handle bar. This isn't a big problem if you hold on to the bar. Although Canyon introduced a system to counteract this.
[2025-01-23T15:03:44] Lieven L.: https://www.bikeradar.com/news/canyon-syntace-kis-self-centring-steering-stabilisation-system
[2025-01-23T16:14:38] Lieven L.: Its mostly the steering angle. Trail is also depending on the wheel size.
[2025-01-23T16:15:35] Jan: Trail looks good, there are other influences that matter too though. There is a nice video on youtube. TED talk about stability of two wheeler
[2025-01-23T16:16:24] Lieven L.: But the slack steering angle will improve the bikes/forks performance when hitting rocks and other obstacles.
[2025-01-23T16:17:40] Lieven L.: I actually own the Intense sister bike with this geometry 😉
[2025-01-23T16:24:10] Jan: https://youtu.be/2Y4mbT3ozcA?si=OpmVHHPwcMNtO7hE
[2025-01-23T16:24:23] Jan: Probably the most important two wheeler video ever
[2025-01-23T16:34:41] Jan: You can make a two wheeler stable with zero trail
[2025-01-23T16:37:06] Lieven L.: They are pretty stable to speeds up to 100km/h.
[2025-01-23T16:47:59] Jan: Its like making a 10S12P 40PL pack with 60KV motors and sausage cable. It will work but there are easier options to achieve the same results
[2025-01-23T16:50:55] haku: dam they had jetson bolts in the 40s. https://youtube.com/shorts/0slkvBHHwgU?si=N2xFoa1_jBAuUUCb
[2025-01-23T16:55:42] Lieven L.: Do you want to do downhill stuff or more street riding?
[2025-01-23T16:57:15] francois schempers: burned the c350 😂😂 I'm waiting on @SibClimb 's diagnostic

[2025-01-23T17:30:27] Matte: Go fardriver and see what real phase amps are
[2025-01-23T17:32:49] Lieven L.: Okay then high power won't be an issue. Because for going downhill high power makes less sense since you can use gravity anway.
[2025-01-23T17:37:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Depends bro
[2025-01-23T17:37:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Old ones different
[2025-01-23T17:37:48] Lieven L.: Ah okay, really depends on the speed you want to go. My 450 enduro bike doesn't feel great at higher speeds above 120 km/h. The geo is just not good for that. While on my Ducati 120 km/h feels like you're parked.
[2025-01-23T17:37:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And in dh world if you dh ,for real
[2025-01-23T17:38:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: One frame is one year and not more
[2025-01-23T17:38:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That jumping is not for free any sus you have on these alu frames
[2025-01-23T17:38:34] francois schempers: it's a c350, 3shull Controller, 20s batt and FH60 3kw motor, all that cramed in a g2 max frame
[2025-01-23T17:38:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Than its good for a normal biker but not for dh
[2025-01-23T17:38:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: It would broke at some point
[2025-01-23T17:39:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: True thing
[2025-01-23T17:39:39] Matte: 100kmh on a downhill bike sounds super fun, but they aren't made to have 40kg of hardware on them plus a rider...
[2025-01-23T17:39:52] haku: what happened? just blew up? we are to heavy for electeic bro
[2025-01-23T17:40:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Mostly not
[2025-01-23T17:40:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But i did dh
[2025-01-23T17:40:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: 127 was top
[2025-01-23T17:40:28] Lieven L.: It's terrifying 😅
[2025-01-23T17:40:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But did 70 on neuser for a bet
[2025-01-23T17:40:48] haku: need to loose weight and get cut. not swole
[2025-01-23T17:41:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Every trip new brake pads in the end😁
[2025-01-23T17:41:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: When i was youth it was damn fun ,now you could not pay me to that shit again
[2025-01-23T17:42:00] Matte: Have a CF mid drive emtb. 100Nm on the chain, it eats cassettes and chains for breakfast. I can not imagine more power on that thing. The rear suspension likes to bend on load and it's all CF as well
[2025-01-23T17:42:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And never felt ever🤷 Just different toys came
[2025-01-23T17:42:41] 'lekrsu': My Lite hasn't blown up at 5kW yet
[2025-01-23T17:42:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's sounds nice
[2025-01-23T17:43:31] Happy Giraffe: Its how all cassette mid drives will do if chain has to go sideways
[2025-01-23T17:43:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But imagine an m12 milwaukee has more nm than a golf3🤷‍♂
[2025-01-23T17:43:50] Matte: Real 1000 phase amp fardriver that melts motors or a vesc that blows itself up because of the horoscope. Hmm decisions decisions
[2025-01-23T17:44:12] Happy Giraffe: Single gear 72v bafang bbshd pushing 5000w peak and been fine for 4-5000km using single speed chain and gear
[2025-01-23T17:44:19] Lieven L.: Yeah most of the MTB stuff is not meant for high torque applications. But people also new shift on a bike and let the motor do the work, so the torque is constantly killing components.
[2025-01-23T17:44:22] Matte: It's very enjoyable going effortless over the high grass fields
[2025-01-23T17:45:32] Matte: It doesn't feel like you're giving it gas, it feels like you're a superman pedaling
[2025-01-23T17:45:42] Matte: Very nice
[2025-01-23T17:47:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Lot depends on what you have and what you can use I mean ,you have a nice old dh frame ,whats a win already And if i remember good you upgraded that to have stronger fork arms And whole is kinda small for these powers in basic ,i mean bike stuff
[2025-01-23T17:47:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I got you 👍👍
[2025-01-23T17:47:55] haku: i peaked at 26kw no problem with these vescs. i think theres a problem with my settings
[2025-01-23T17:49:40] haku: also fardriver wiring looks horrible. vesc very simple. idk man. ill give it more chances i think its my fault
[2025-01-23T17:51:25] Matte: Bms cuts out vesc blows up
[2025-01-23T17:51:41] haku: not for spintend i believe
[2025-01-23T17:52:41] Happy Giraffe: Frame is stock, issue is just how these typical bikes are geared to have stress on chain that doesnt run straight
[2025-01-23T17:53:01] haku: the world is just cucking me atm. ticket on highway, broken phone, borken vesc and broke ass cant afford all these
[2025-01-23T17:53:30] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I don't need to worry about this as @Dualtron_Achillleus said I'm flight
[2025-01-23T17:53:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I get it now
[2025-01-23T17:53:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Cheapo bikes all like that
[2025-01-23T17:54:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: At that price i think they should provide a good warranty
[2025-01-23T17:54:27] Happy Giraffe: All 36-48v bikes are as they lack rpm (and field weakening) to use higher tooth chainrings on back
[2025-01-23T17:55:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: The super fun versions are bending pedal axle while onyl thing is your leg weight,you never pedal for real😂
[2025-01-23T17:55:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I would also add what was mentioned above
[2025-01-23T17:56:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I mean ppl want to much
[2025-01-23T17:56:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: A speed bike not for mountens and off road
[2025-01-23T17:56:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Here.
[2025-01-23T18:01:21] haku: do you guys think its possible for the feds to hack my vesc and blow it up? track me in the highway and break my phone?
[2025-01-23T18:02:11] haku: asking for a friend
[2025-01-23T18:04:05] haku: my dog is the fed im sure that guy snitching on me
[2025-01-23T18:14:27] haku: maybe china did this to me. im not sure anymore. the new bambu update mustve hacked me
[2025-01-23T18:18:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: First part unsure 😜🙈 They caught you again?
[2025-01-23T18:19:21] haku: no i avoid highways now. but everything happened in a span of a week. crazy stuff
[2025-01-23T18:20:28] haku: vesc never blew up on highway cruising. it always dies from dead stop and pinning throttle
[2025-01-23T18:21:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Sometimes shit storms happen , cant say such doesnt exist
[2025-01-23T18:21:45] haku: ill just count my blessings. crazy week
[2025-01-23T18:23:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Well if all was good and no overkills on top or each other Than maybe something died,honestly we never managed to kill a vesc ,but never try to overkill, coz we build for custormers and i dont want ppl coming back for such
[2025-01-23T18:23:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But i experienced blessing day
[2025-01-23T18:24:29] haku: yea my sons and jetsons never broke. even the 100/100v2. i think im too heavy for the power im asking it
[2025-01-23T18:24:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Huge Road crossing, you had cross 3 different parts when you have priority ,than you are on closed road for cars
[2025-01-23T18:25:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: All 3 depended on my self,that i could speed up not to be hit
[2025-01-23T18:25:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And than there was a fourth two corners away
[2025-01-23T18:25:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: While
[2025-01-23T18:25:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: The biker who was behind me got hit
[2025-01-23T18:25:54] haku: tbh i think riding in the bikelane is a faster way of transopration than riding tge wepoor on stoplights in peak hours
[2025-01-23T18:26:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Surly
[2025-01-23T18:26:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's what i was doing
[2025-01-23T18:27:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not to mention 😁😂
[2025-01-23T18:28:03] haku: i noticed this yesterday when i was stuck in traffic and another ebike i saw on the bilelane just passed me
[2025-01-23T18:28:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: My bambu life started with that Update
[2025-01-23T18:29:02] haku: i havent used printer yet so not sure how it is
[2025-01-23T18:29:16] Happy Giraffe: You had the slow absolute current turned on?
[2025-01-23T18:29:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I printed from yesterday 11 pm and still printing
[2025-01-23T18:29:54] haku: not sure. i have to check
[2025-01-23T18:30:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You awd?
[2025-01-23T18:30:43] haku: not on jetson and sons bike
[2025-01-23T18:31:01] haku: the wepoor thats the one that always blows the front motor vesc
[2025-01-23T18:35:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Not up to date in you vehicle names
[2025-01-23T18:35:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: What blow up on highway was awd?
[2025-01-23T18:35:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Hmmm🤔
[2025-01-23T18:36:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: If you like and have time list me in dm what is what and knowledge in short
[2025-01-23T18:37:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Your weight should not be a problem
[2025-01-23T18:37:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: I have 150+ kg customer scooting with a flip issules
[2025-01-23T18:37:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: He walks with it
[2025-01-23T18:38:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Recently coming coz he eats the tires
[2025-01-23T18:40:39] haku: this wepoor. my theory is the bms. this bms has cucked me before.
[2025-01-23T19:08:13] haku: the golden age is over. unfortunate stuff whats happening to these coast states. i predicted this back then. https://youtu.be/pE6lnV6mW8k?si=bu-p-92bxn2E3fAN
[2025-01-23T19:27:21] francois schempers: nah it's not about weight, I don't know yet what happen, I guess he will tell us, but the c350 can do up to 15kw, so we should be good 😂
[2025-01-23T19:29:15] francois schempers: we'll see, big chance is that it's my fault, misconfigured it surely, so I will pay what he ask me for repair, and if it's a warranty issue we will see, u bought it last year and it was sitting on a shelf, so we'll see
[2025-01-23T19:30:09] Yamal: <photos/photo_21023@23-01-2025_19-30-09.jpg>
[2025-01-23T19:33:13] francois schempers: not bad 👏
[2025-01-23T22:06:53] Yamal: ^^'
[2025-01-23T22:07:07] Yamal: Thanke shunt
[2025-01-23T22:51:29] Yamal: The way back,,,,,
[2025-01-23T22:57:34] Yamal: I know perfectly well that kw will not increase as long as I do not raise the phase amperes regardless of the fact that these are limited by the battery amperes.
[2025-01-23T23:20:20] haku: what bat and phase you have?
[2025-01-23T23:20:36] Yamal: 150/200
[2025-01-23T23:22:37] 'lekrsu': Your phase is above batt so peak wattage will be by battery current
[2025-01-23T23:26:00] haku: i wonder how accurate vesctool is when reading power. will it match a dyno
[2025-01-23T23:27:12] Matte: it would never match a dyno no matter which controller
[2025-01-23T23:27:30] 'lekrsu': Quite accurate
[2025-01-23T23:28:32] Yamal: This is the conclusion I have drawn by taking the battery at 200A/150A and the phase at 180/200A. I have seen that the maximum power fluctuates more with the variation of the phase current.
[2025-01-23T23:31:31] Yamal: With motors with phases that support it, it would take 300 phase and 175 battery + speed winding... it would be nice, but it can't be, life is hard; In the same way, now it is super fun and explosive, more than one pizza man has already been left frozen on his motorcycle xD
[2025-01-23T23:31:49] haku: why is that. wouldnt a dyno be the best one to measure power for all kinds of controllers
[2025-01-23T23:32:45] Matte: power in never equals power out, its just physics
[2025-01-23T23:33:02] haku: i mean measure in HP and torque
[2025-01-23T23:33:10] haku: power to the wheels
[2025-01-23T23:33:37] haku: im not a physician so i have no idea
[2025-01-23T23:38:55] haku: i would love LY 17x4 winding and smaller vesc and battery when laws come
[2025-01-23T23:38:55] Matte: yeah but to compare dyno to dyno results
[2025-01-23T23:39:27] Yamal: Or jumbo to jimbo
[2025-01-23T23:39:38] Yamal: Not the same
[2025-01-23T23:39:42] haku: 17x4 and less discharge battery can still prolly do burnouts with my weight
[2025-01-23T23:50:45] Noname: Mabey that 0 ramp time?
[2025-01-24T00:04:25] haku: maybe your right but i will not fuck up for the third time after this. we will see
[2025-01-24T00:47:07] Noname: https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1E8tCRrYCD/ @Bradhaku
[2025-01-24T00:48:13] haku: if i want to do this. it has to be built from frame only. i want to make my own battery
[2025-01-24T01:17:17] haku: if i can register wepoor that would be the move.
[2025-01-24T01:18:42] haku: 72v vesc jetson bolt gents. em i the only one that did this? is there any other like minded individuals like me? men of culture.
[2025-01-24T01:23:49] Noname: Here yes but you downloaded the battery holder somewhere
[2025-01-24T01:24:00] Marius: could do that on your g30 frame for sure
[2025-01-24T01:24:08] Marius: relatively low budget
[2025-01-24T01:32:37] haku: this is what i mean. this should be universal to everything with motors and wheels yea?
[2025-01-24T01:34:34] haku: i got it from a jetson expert and battery builder
[2025-01-24T01:42:14] Matte: google how same vehicle has different power on different dyno
[2025-01-24T02:03:43] haku: really? good to know
[2025-01-24T02:18:54] Noname: Dyno resistance is different between manufacturers. Your not pushing weight of vehicle but turning rollers
[2025-01-24T02:31:14] haku: i see. but only people speak in whp. it should be universal imo
[2025-01-24T02:59:13] Noname: Yeah your watts convert to hp
[2025-01-24T02:59:52] haku: is there a thing called watts to the wheels?
[2025-01-24T03:00:04] Noname: Yeah 26kw or whatever
[2025-01-24T03:00:17] Noname: Or 30hp ish
[2025-01-24T03:00:22] haku: thats to the wheels?
[2025-01-24T03:00:32] Noname: You can measure in lots of things
[2025-01-24T03:00:40] haku: or what the vesc is giving the motor
[2025-01-24T03:00:42] Noname: Yeah your wheels are the motors
[2025-01-24T03:00:57] Noname: There's no loss in transmission
[2025-01-24T03:01:02] Noname: Or driveline
[2025-01-24T03:01:04] haku: what about torque?
[2025-01-24T03:01:45] Noname: You can calculate with info you have
[2025-01-24T03:02:02] haku: gotcha. need to learn all this
[2025-01-24T06:04:32] Yamal: Friday very good
[2025-01-24T06:04:48] Yamal: But tomorrow maybe rain ,,,,,
[2025-01-24T07:35:24] Yamal: They say that at night all cats look brown
[2025-01-24T08:13:48] Yamal: <photos/photo_21027@24-01-2025_08-13-48.jpg>
[2025-01-24T08:14:59] haku: wild rider! sounds badass like a turbo spooling
[2025-01-24T08:16:17] Yamal: I don't go with a lot of voltage, so it doesn't end up being entirely killer
[2025-01-24T12:53:46] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <video_file>

[2025-01-24T13:18:13] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 120kmh 🤣🤣
[2025-01-24T13:27:04] GABE: Law be like yes this is very safe
[2025-01-24T13:33:57] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I was going 20 km/h. My Xiaomi is as it came out of the box. The time will come when it will bury me 🤣
[2025-01-24T14:02:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Claims he has more stable firmware then maker x themselves is he believable?
[2025-01-24T14:02:54] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_21030@24-01-2025_14-02-54.jpg>
[2025-01-24T14:05:16] GABE: Odd
[2025-01-24T14:05:27] GABE: I know nothing about this but feels fishy no
[2025-01-24T14:08:41] GABE: Where exactly do I go to get Aluminium welded?
[2025-01-24T14:08:51] GABE: Stupid question probably.
[2025-01-24T14:09:19] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I will talk to him, he is Spanish
[2025-01-24T14:09:26] GABE: Alu specifically requires a high power auto welder I believ
[2025-01-24T14:09:55] GABE: 30 euros ship, definitely not insured then.
[2025-01-24T14:10:00] GABE: 😆
[2025-01-24T14:11:38] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: But this boy doesn't understand much, maybe with him a few days ago
[2025-01-24T14:11:54] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The website gives free shipping
[2025-01-24T14:12:27] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: That's right, but there are people who want to earn money from the work of others.
[2025-01-24T14:12:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: He asked for help in vesc how can he claim to have a better firmware
[2025-01-24T14:13:55] Andrei Albert: 🤣🤣
[2025-01-24T14:14:14] Andrei Albert: Good question
[2025-01-24T14:14:28] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: He is from Barcelona and a few days ago he spoke to me for his configuration. I told him that I could help him with the little that I know, but this guy no longer helped me. I'm sorry.
[2025-01-24T14:14:56] Andrei Albert: Messaged me too
[2025-01-24T14:15:33] Yamal: A un “tornero” :)
[2025-01-24T14:16:08] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Well, he's just closing the doors on himself. I don't understand people like that.
[2025-01-24T14:17:03] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: In short if it's the g300 then maker x website is the answer
[2025-01-24T14:17:30] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: that's how it is
[2025-01-24T15:10:23] Unknown: When theres no bike lane 20 is too fast on a sidewalk and too slow for the street
[2025-01-24T15:10:44] Unknown: If there are people on the sidewalk
[2025-01-24T15:27:32] Noname: It's not that different than steel. Mig welding is easy but messy. Tig is pretty and clean but takes talent. Is there any fab shops around you?

[2025-01-25T23:05:14] Jan: However a tire like this at 3bar is still like 600-800kg force from the pressure trying to split the rim apart
[2025-01-25T23:05:32] Jan: If you split that on 5x M4 bolts its a bit lol
[2025-01-25T23:06:14] Jan: 1x M4 bolt is like 300kg ultimate tensile
[2025-01-25T23:06:31] Jan: <photos/photo_21060@25-01-2025_23-06-31.jpg>
[2025-01-25T23:06:56] Jan: Still on 5x M4 bolts its like a safety factor of 2
[2025-01-25T23:07:37] Jan: I have 15x 570kg max load on the bolts
[2025-01-25T23:07:52] Jan: Safety factor 10x

[2025-01-26T04:30:46] Mattia: the voltage is correct when not connected to the bms
[2025-01-26T04:30:54] rosheee: and cable correct connected?
[2025-01-26T04:31:00] rosheee: and soldered

[2025-01-26T04:31:03] Mattia: Yes
[2025-01-26T04:31:11] rosheee: why then show this sad voltage on 2+3?
[2025-01-26T04:31:27] rosheee: and nearly 5v on 4 xD?
[2025-01-26T04:31:35] Mattia: Look at the voltagge on 1 and 4

[2025-01-26T04:32:05] rosheee: u soldered like in manual xD?
[2025-01-26T04:32:14] Mattia: added together they make 10.5, which would be the total value of the voltage between series 1,2,3,4
[2025-01-26T04:32:24] Mattia: In what sense
[2025-01-26T04:32:32] Mattia: my english is not good

[2025-01-26T15:04:55] Mirono escooters: :(
[2025-01-26T15:34:16] 'lekrsu': gone?

[2025-01-26T16:15:28] haku: what?
[2025-01-26T16:19:41] GABE: 5%. Most beers are 4%... means if you buy a 12 pack, you're essentially buying 9...
[2025-01-26T16:19:53] GABE: I've seen 3.8

[2025-01-26T16:23:12] Mirono escooters: Start with finishing config
[2025-01-26T16:24:11] Mirono escooters: Then check. Showing 5v impossible, or it is missing a wire (wrong connected) or config wrong
[2025-01-26T16:24:43] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: what has happened
[2025-01-26T16:24:43] Mirono escooters: Unplug and measure on balance lead, mistake is ez made, especially with these Bluetooth bmses where you need to follow a specific diagram
[2025-01-26T16:31:41] Mattia: I follow the diagram
[2025-01-26T16:31:45] Mattia: Was all correct

[2025-01-26T17:11:46] haku: i just dont like the color and the big letter A on the side for asshole
[2025-01-26T17:15:57] Noname: Eh kinda fugly
[2025-01-26T17:20:33] haku: its not bad. if they sell just the frame you can prolly fit a big battery and motor on that
[2025-01-26T17:28:36] haku: very hard to do. pistol squats with a barbell. but shes wearing heels that makes it easier
[2025-01-26T17:28:48] Noname: This or nothing
[2025-01-26T17:31:32] haku: wheres the battery compartment?
[2025-01-26T17:33:35] haku: midrive is a plus though
[2025-01-26T17:34:07] Noname: <photos/photo_21089@26-01-2025_17-34-07.jpg>
[2025-01-26T17:35:27] haku: when i look at frames now. all i think is how much space for battery
[2025-01-26T17:36:41] Noname: 72v 58ah isn't bad
[2025-01-26T17:39:17] haku: look at this champ. built and welded frame. this is the way.
[2025-01-26T17:40:10] haku: if i can just afford the tools and the milling machines i would too
[2025-01-26T17:40:40] Jason: 16.92uF on this board lmao
[2025-01-26T17:41:30] haku: what does that mean? bad good?
[2025-01-26T17:41:45] Jason: uhh idk

[2025-01-26T17:42:12] haku: i see.
[2025-01-26T17:42:26] Jason: or is it
[2025-01-26T17:42:36] Jason: googled it
[2025-01-26T17:42:38] Jason: its correct
[2025-01-26T17:42:54] Jason: 36x 470nF
[2025-01-26T17:42:58] Jason: lolol

[2025-01-26T17:43:14] haku: isnt farad measurement for capacitors?
[2025-01-26T17:46:50] 'lekrsu': ;)
[2025-01-26T17:47:08] Jason: :)
[2025-01-26T17:47:36] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-01-26T18:01:20] Mirono escooters: Or wrong config
[2025-01-26T18:01:32] Mirono escooters: Ant does that sometimes
[2025-01-26T18:01:43] Mirono escooters: But weird it's first 4 cells
[2025-01-26T18:03:50] Noname: I can tell you from the weld on the edge of the seat pan his welds suck. And need some center support that will fold in half as is
[2025-01-26T18:05:03] Noname: You have a link to that
[2025-01-26T18:06:30] haku: no. its a invite only. i dont even know how ingot in tbh
[2025-01-26T18:07:22] haku: its not a free speech channel so im not participating much
[2025-01-26T18:07:37] Noname: Oh selective free speech
[2025-01-26T18:08:00] haku: im only active on free speech platforms
[2025-01-26T18:09:55] Mirono escooters: Still error
[2025-01-26T18:18:16] haku: ant bms woke just saying
[2025-01-26T18:20:37] haku: sorry i just had to get that off my chest
[2025-01-26T18:37:43] GABE: Woketard
[2025-01-26T18:39:48] GABE: Jahaha
[2025-01-26T18:41:43] Mirono escooters: Ant BMS config bit more fiddly
[2025-01-26T18:41:53] Mirono escooters: But I prefer over jbd if money or size no issue :-)
[2025-01-26T18:42:00] Mirono escooters: Usually both issue :)
[2025-01-26T18:48:04] Noname: Jk is king
[2025-01-26T18:48:11] Noname: But huge lol
[2025-01-26T18:52:28] haku: i wonder if its the ant bms configuration that keeps blowing my vescs
[2025-01-26T18:54:02] haku: i set it at 510 cuttoff
[2025-01-26T18:54:35] haku: the 2nd time idk what happened there
[2025-01-26T18:57:03] Jason: <photos/photo_21092@26-01-2025_18-57-03.jpg>
[2025-01-26T18:57:05] Jason: mmm
[2025-01-26T18:57:15] Jason: space for phase wire
[2025-01-26T18:57:23] Jason: i could go smaller tbh
[2025-01-26T18:57:39] Noname: He was walking dog it wasn't hot
[2025-01-26T18:58:59] haku: yea it was like 30c or less. cold day
[2025-01-26T18:59:27] haku: i blame the dog.
[2025-01-26T18:59:55] haku: everytime i take him on walks with that bike someshit happens
[2025-01-26T19:00:31] Mirono escooters: Meh, except with ebrake BMS really can't hurt a vEsc that much
[2025-01-26T19:00:55] haku: trans dog with a trans bike
[2025-01-26T19:01:25] haku: you know i also thought it might be the regen. i have spinny.
[2025-01-26T19:01:54] Mirono escooters: Did it die when u ebrake?
[2025-01-26T19:02:10] Mirono escooters: Funny looking scooter
[2025-01-26T19:02:29] Yamal: Nice table
[2025-01-26T19:02:31] haku: no idea. i mostly ride on spinny only when i walk dog. maybe i was regen then pinned throttle
[2025-01-26T19:02:36] Yamal: Really stone ,,?
[2025-01-26T19:02:46] haku: yes. my castle
[2025-01-26T19:02:52] Mirono escooters: MOSFETs died?
[2025-01-26T19:03:04] haku: yea. i think
[2025-01-26T19:03:17] haku: 1 phase
[2025-01-26T19:03:26] Mirono escooters: Need bigger vEsc obviously, tronic x12 time, tap your savings :)
[2025-01-26T19:03:45] Mirono escooters: Or a 3shul, go big
[2025-01-26T19:03:47] Jason: lol
[2025-01-26T19:04:03] Mirono escooters: Flipsky 75100 🔥

[2025-01-26T19:04:31] Jason: hah
[2025-01-26T19:04:33] haku: no i just need proper vesc config
[2025-01-26T19:04:35] Jason: different one
[2025-01-26T19:05:05] Jason: way better design than what rage tested
[2025-01-26T19:05:06] Mirono escooters: Why them ceramic caps over there
[2025-01-26T19:05:06] Jason: imo
[2025-01-26T19:05:12] Jason: no space
[2025-01-26T19:05:34] Mirono escooters: Every mm matters 👀
[2025-01-26T19:06:08] Jason: all under 140mm lol

[2025-01-26T19:06:18] Jason: 18fet toll
[2025-01-26T19:06:33] Mirono escooters: What vEsc is that, I haven't followed the past months
[2025-01-26T19:06:38] Jason: gesc
[2025-01-26T19:06:51] Jason: i originally named that for g30 drop in esc but...
[2025-01-26T19:06:56] Jason: things went quite sideways
[2025-01-26T19:06:59] Mirono escooters: J(ason)esc
[2025-01-26T19:07:05] Jason: should change to that lol
[2025-01-26T19:07:14] Mirono escooters: 75100 is drop in Esc for g30
[2025-01-26T19:07:17] Mirono escooters: Go biggur
[2025-01-26T19:14:33] Dualtron Achilleus: yes 200w
[2025-01-26T19:18:28] haku: can you weld like this Noname
[2025-01-26T19:18:56] haku: how much do welds like this cost per hour?
[2025-01-26T19:19:19] Andrei Albert: O sold it
[2025-01-26T19:20:45] Noname: That's tig and I have like 5 min experience. That's very expensive because it's slower and technical
[2025-01-26T19:21:03] haku: its pretty though.
[2025-01-26T19:21:16] haku: is it as strong as mig?
[2025-01-26T19:21:30] Noname: Yeah
[2025-01-26T19:21:55] haku: i remember the welds on my headers use to like like this
[2025-01-26T19:22:18] haku: exhaust too
[2025-01-26T19:22:39] haku: i want a bike with these kind of welds
[2025-01-26T19:22:58] haku: with the rainbow effect and all
[2025-01-26T19:26:40] Noname: That's usually stainless that does that
[2025-01-26T19:29:05] haku: very cool
[2025-01-26T19:29:32] haku: is it easy ti learn tig at home? or need to go to weld school?
[2025-01-26T19:30:39] Noname: Schools like a welding academy are usually a money grab. You might find a tech school that offers classes
[2025-01-26T19:31:16] haku: youtube academy
[2025-01-26T19:31:34] Noname: I learned by being handed a welder at 15 and here have fun
[2025-01-26T19:32:36] Noname: Prob a bit sloppy and I have no technical info.on what I'm doing but I make things and they hold
[2025-01-26T19:34:09] haku: i was rollerblading at 15 like a gay while you there doing man shit.
[2025-01-26T19:34:42] haku: i bet you cant skate like me though
[2025-01-26T19:39:29] Noname: Yeah we just built things. cb900 4cyl in an atv. And rode dirt bikes
[2025-01-26T21:51:35] haku: this is what hard work mexicans get in the US.
[2025-01-26T21:51:40] haku: prolly 100k in parts

[2025-01-26T21:58:19] Yamal: I don’t know why the sticker move xD
[2025-01-26T21:58:32] haku: is it an app?
[2025-01-26T21:59:26] Yamal: on iphone it is simply copying the image, gives you the option to generate the sticker..
[2025-01-26T21:59:57] haku: i see. im not tech savy. i have samsung

[2025-01-26T23:23:42] Patrick: xD
[2025-01-26T23:25:28] Matte: I mean, there is no replacing the sheer thermal mass 100W soldering iron has, no matter the price of a soldering station
[2025-01-26T23:26:09] Matte: thats like advertising how inadequate your tool is

[2025-01-27T01:52:01] JPPL: Makerbase
[2025-01-27T01:53:02] Finn: Mks going crazy
[2025-01-27T01:53:23] Finn: Working hardware with 0 errors when?
[2025-01-27T01:53:59] JPPL: Im just costumer 😭 dont know, but seems on final stage
[2025-01-27T01:55:06] haku: whoa. what makerbase is that
[2025-01-27T01:55:48] Finn: ^^
[2025-01-27T01:56:12] haku: board is alu?
[2025-01-27T01:56:49] haku: oh its epoxy
[2025-01-27T01:58:29] Finn: Tolt mosfets when
[2025-01-27T01:58:50] Finn: With alu heatspreader
[2025-01-27T02:07:35] haku: this one can take 300 battery? and how much phase?
[2025-01-27T02:07:58] Matte: its a vesc, i bet its not battery amps
[2025-01-27T02:08:53] haku: what? i dont understand. my old 12fet can do 250bat-300phase. only killed it because of stupidity
[2025-01-27T02:09:17] haku: its the 85250spintend
[2025-01-27T02:11:35] haku: i see
[2025-01-27T02:12:55] haku: need to study these vescs and how its cooled.
[2025-01-27T02:13:39] haku: when i continue focforevers legacy on future youtube i have to know these things.
[2025-01-27T02:14:04] haku: gotcha
[2025-01-27T02:15:23] haku: is it easy to replace those with tolt. or you need to do some other stuff to make it work?
[2025-01-27T02:16:17] haku: gotcha
[2025-01-27T02:16:57] haku: are tolt mosfets more expensive than regular toll like HY?
[2025-01-27T02:20:38] haku: last one. is it western made or china. sorry for all the noob questions bro
[2025-01-27T02:20:51] JPPL: Seema g300 style 😭
[2025-01-27T02:21:00] JPPL: China
[2025-01-27T02:21:21] haku: tolt mosfets
[2025-01-27T02:21:43] haku: gotcha
[2025-01-27T02:22:21] haku: i neef an engineer to design a 100fet tolt to be the end all be all of all vescs

[2025-01-27T02:22:58] JPPL: Go comment that kind of sugestiona
[2025-01-27T02:23:13] haku: we going to end torps false claims
[2025-01-27T02:39:42] Matthew: Is it same to a spintend unit 85150? I have 90bat even entering 180 phase it never goes much over 150 amps phase. Like 154-160phase.
[2025-01-27T02:47:39] Matthew: Yup
[2025-01-27T02:48:06] haku: dam some skills right there
[2025-01-27T02:48:34] haku: Noname is a mig peasant. ugly ass welds i bet
[2025-01-27T02:49:38] Matthew: Depending on the industry you're working in is the difference and location. Where I'm at $50hr is pretty much cap. If you land a job in full R&D you can demand more $60-80hr.
[2025-01-27T02:50:01] haku: gotcha.
[2025-01-27T02:50:51] haku: theres a technique to get beads looking like this yea
[2025-01-27T02:50:58] Matthew: Mig welding gets a bad rap but honestly there's some wire types and positions using mig and it definitely takes a talented/experienced hand.
[2025-01-27T02:51:20] Matthew: Yesir
[2025-01-27T02:53:45] Noname: Here's some trash truck parts I welded 50$ cash and it don't matter what it looks like
[2025-01-27T02:54:12] haku: i just fucking with you dude. looks good
[2025-01-27T02:54:48] Noname: <photos/photo_21104@27-01-2025_02-54-48.jpg>
[2025-01-27T02:55:00] Matthew: <photos/photo_21105@27-01-2025_02-55-00.jpg>
[2025-01-27T02:55:00] Matthew: <photos/photo_21106@27-01-2025_02-55-00.jpg>
[2025-01-27T02:55:01] Matthew: <photos/photo_21107@27-01-2025_02-55-01.jpg>
[2025-01-27T02:55:01] Noname: Well started like this so only got better
[2025-01-27T02:55:01] Matthew: <photos/photo_21108@27-01-2025_02-55-01.jpg>
[2025-01-27T02:55:02] Matthew: <photos/photo_21109@27-01-2025_02-55-02.jpg>
[2025-01-27T02:55:14] haku: oh wow
[2025-01-27T02:55:45] Matthew: The corner weld with color i weld in a certain order building up the weld. It's a rather deep bevel
[2025-01-27T02:56:20] haku: need to go to class for this stuff. always in my 2025 list
[2025-01-27T02:57:49] Matthew: We use a special gas where I'm at right now. Virtually no company in the world does this. The proprietary mix is called blueshield and it's a mixture of hydrogen gas and argon.
[2025-01-27T02:58:32] haku: can you buy that at a store or need special liscence to get it
[2025-01-27T02:58:51] Matthew: Learn how to tig weld and get good at it and there's lots of things you can do. Some native I used to work with would make native American jewelry. He was really godo
[2025-01-27T02:58:54] Matthew: Good
[2025-01-27T02:59:12] Matthew: Gas suppliers will have it
[2025-01-27T02:59:21] haku: tig can also do aluminum yea
[2025-01-27T03:00:02] Matthew: Tig you can basically weld anything any alloy. Most definitely the nicest process for aluminum
[2025-01-27T03:00:29] Matthew: You can actually braze using tig.
[2025-01-27T03:00:46] Matthew: Silicon bronze wire is interesting
[2025-01-27T03:01:31] haku: is this the stuff used for titanium too or thats a whole different machine?
[2025-01-27T03:02:34] Matthew: <photos/photo_21110@27-01-2025_03-02-34.jpg>
[2025-01-27T03:02:36] Noname: You Def can't mig Ti with steel set up I tried lol
[2025-01-27T03:02:44] haku: im jealous for the guys that can do this. very important skill
[2025-01-27T03:03:03] Matthew: Titanium is best with tig.
[2025-01-27T03:03:36] Matthew: Very sensitive alloy to weld, but get the gas shielding you need and it welds like steel
[2025-01-27T03:04:10] Noname: Haku needs a 100$ mig Yes welder and some backyard practice
[2025-01-27T03:04:17] haku: if i knew how to weld and had all the tools. you guys will see the wildest smallest bike ever
[2025-01-27T03:04:29] Matthew: We usually weld titanium in an actual chamber so we don't have to worry about scrapping a part from contamination
[2025-01-27T03:05:22] Matthew: With a multiprocess welding machine you can do a bit of everything in your own home garage
[2025-01-27T03:05:57] Matthew: Tig machine you can also stick weld with and also carbon arc gouge
[2025-01-27T03:06:48] haku: how much does a good machine that can do all cost?
[2025-01-27T03:07:12] haku: are those all in one any good?
[2025-01-27T03:08:04] Matthew: You can stick weld almost any alloy out there as well, but must be on certain parts generally thick. Inconel and titanium are amazing alloys and generally common use is aerospace and in aerospace we use very thin metal so you most definitely aren't stick welding. I used to weld this one part and it was only .018" thicn
[2025-01-27T03:08:05] haku: ill sell my dog for exotic meats and get one
[2025-01-27T03:10:15] Matthew: So what i think is way to go is the multiprocess tig, stick, plasma. And then have a separate mig welder.
[2025-01-27T03:10:19] Noname: Needs miler 135 wants a hi tec metal fusion machine
[2025-01-27T03:10:57] haku: yea ive seen youtube videos of those all in one machines. im not sure if paid review though
[2025-01-27T03:11:32] Noname: Yes unless there's a dog barking in the background never trust YouTube review
[2025-01-27T03:12:07] haku: noted haha
[2025-01-27T03:13:23] Matthew: <photos/photo_21111@27-01-2025_03-13-23.jpg>
[2025-01-27T03:13:26] Matthew: <photos/photo_21112@27-01-2025_03-13-26.jpg>
[2025-01-27T03:14:24] Matthew: The first mig/tig machine pic there would be something I'd personally buy. As long as you have 200+ amps you're set to weld
[2025-01-27T03:14:38] Noname: Even Amazon lies
[2025-01-27T03:14:42] Mattia: <photos/photo_21114@27-01-2025_03-14-42.jpg>
[2025-01-27T03:15:10] Mattia: when i click to update the firmware it gets stuck at 0.2%
[2025-01-27T03:15:13] haku: is that the same one?
[2025-01-27T03:15:40] Mattia: I can't even reset the BMS from the app
[2025-01-27T03:16:01] Noname: 2300$
[2025-01-27T03:16:10] Matthew: Yeah, you gotta watch that. If you get on welding groups and forums these everlast welders are good and have good reputation and customer service. My buddy ran a DIY garage spot in Miami and he used everlast products
[2025-01-27T03:16:11] Noname: Lol save them 1$
[2025-01-27T03:16:16] haku: ill keep an eye out onnthe beat deals on these
[2025-01-27T03:16:16] Mattia: <photos/photo_21114@27-01-2025_03-14-42.jpg>
[2025-01-27T03:16:17] Mattia: when i click to update the firmware it gets stuck at 0.2%
[2025-01-27T03:16:17] Mattia: I can't even reset the BMS from the app
[2025-01-27T03:16:38] Matthew: You pay for features and power
[2025-01-27T03:17:33] Noname: Update app?
[2025-01-27T03:17:36] Matthew: You also don't need to pay for red or blue(Lincoln electric or Miller)
[2025-01-27T03:17:59] Mattia: can you send me the link to download the latest version
[2025-01-27T03:18:01] Noname: New miller's have China boards
[2025-01-27T03:18:03] Matthew: Miller and Lincoln are good but you're paying extra money for a name.
[2025-01-27T03:18:12] Noname: Idk use app store
[2025-01-27T03:18:31] Noname: Mines 20+ yrs old
[2025-01-27T03:18:40] Noname: I was a kid
[2025-01-27T03:19:06] Matthew: Having a big name welder is for companies to boast to customers and also they normally contract out machines for like 4-5 yrs and then they get replaced with the latest and greatest.
[2025-01-27T03:19:09] haku: ive also read you can spot weld copper on these. no nickle needed
[2025-01-27T03:19:18] Noname: I was given an Eastwood I use for aluminum and can't complain
[2025-01-27T03:19:33] Noname: Tig
[2025-01-27T03:20:56] haku: why pack show 0v? are leads connected?
[2025-01-27T03:21:18] Noname: Lol what my company has the oldest shit possible
[2025-01-27T03:21:39] haku: what was that lazer china welder i linked you before
[2025-01-27T03:21:50] haku: what is that tech
[2025-01-27T03:22:36] Noname: It's just a laser instead of electrical arc
[2025-01-27T03:22:59] haku: no good or good?
[2025-01-27T03:23:07] Noname: Start small your not opening a fab shop
[2025-01-27T03:23:11] haku: buy before tarrifs
[2025-01-27T03:23:11] Mattia: yes
[2025-01-27T03:23:46] Mattia: it no longer shows the voltage after I tried to update the firmware
[2025-01-27T03:23:59] Noname: Idk its thousands of dollars I have .56 cents
[2025-01-27T03:24:19] haku: no its not. its less than 1k atleast
[2025-01-27T03:24:44] haku: its a gamble like buying glitter 811h you never know
[2025-01-27T03:24:54] Noname: Haku
[2025-01-27T03:25:28] haku: yes that one
[2025-01-27T03:25:33] Noname: Lol that's 30% deposit
[2025-01-27T03:25:36] haku: looks easy to use
[2025-01-27T03:25:40] haku: oh what
[2025-01-27T03:25:49] Noname: Read the fine print
[2025-01-27T03:26:14] Noname: <photos/photo_21116@27-01-2025_03-26-14.jpg>
[2025-01-27T03:26:17] Noname: <photos/photo_21117@27-01-2025_03-26-17.jpg>
[2025-01-27T03:26:28] haku: lawd nvm then
[2025-01-27T03:26:44] Noname: Look on marketplace for a mig
[2025-01-27T03:27:19] haku: mig is just weld straight lines yea. no more figure 8 beads
[2025-01-27T03:27:24] Noname: If you suck at welding it helps.your grinding skills win win
[2025-01-27T03:27:48] Noname: It's called stacking dimes
[2025-01-27T03:28:46] Noname: Depends on how you zig zag but learn to make things hold not designs
[2025-01-27T03:28:47] Matthew: Forgot to say. You have to pay more for the machine to be capable of ac and DC processes
[2025-01-27T03:30:42] haku: oh dang. you sure your bms leads are properly wired.
[2025-01-27T03:31:24] haku: im good with my hands 😜
[2025-01-27T03:31:57] Noname: <animation>
[2025-01-27T03:34:50] Noname: Long winded Matthew spit it out
[2025-01-27T03:34:53] Noname: Typing
[2025-01-27T03:34:57] Noname: Typing
[2025-01-27T03:35:32] haku: im all about presentation boys. it has to look good
[2025-01-27T03:36:20] Matthew: Different techniques for mig and Different alloys and processes. There's inner shield flux core wire that's basically the stick welding in the mig world. Dual shield flux core which can be an absolute dream to run at times. Certain alloys really suck to weld with mig. Then there's basic solid "hard wire" the hard wire is ran with different gas mixtures and different positions.
[2025-01-27T03:37:08] Matthew: Sorry. My fingers are fat and take 3x the time to text with all the corrections lol
[2025-01-27T03:37:25] Matthew: I wear xxxl gloves lol
[2025-01-27T03:37:55] haku: im asian size xl gloves.
[2025-01-27T03:38:21] haku: in american size thats a small
[2025-01-27T03:38:52] Mattia: yes
[2025-01-27T03:39:18] Matthew: Haha. When I started this job they tell me pick that chamber up with the crane. Said how?? They said stick your hand in there and pull a strap through. I showed them theres no way in hell that my hands are gonna fit through that hole
[2025-01-27T03:40:24] Noname: Sausage fingers. My boss has paws I make fun of him trying to use small hardware
[2025-01-27T03:41:48] Matthew: Lmaooo
[2025-01-27T03:42:28] Matthew: I have gorilla hands lol
[2025-01-27T03:42:39] Noname: If you don't we make you weld cattle fence
[2025-01-27T03:43:04] Matthew: Lol
[2025-01-27T03:43:04] Matthew: <photos/photo_21118@27-01-2025_03-43-04.jpg>
[2025-01-27T03:43:51] Matthew: Man, there's some beautiful mig you can do. Sometimes you almost wanna lick it haha
[2025-01-27T03:45:21] Noname: Honestly the nicest welding I've seen in my shop was a girl we had looked like a machine did it. Although she couldn't tig for shit but ours is a dinosaur
[2025-01-27T03:49:16] Matthew: Gotcha. A company i worked at for a while and tech school came and had a field trip to our aerospace facility. We sent them back a pallet of sheet metal coupons to weld. They signed their names and sent them back to us and our ndt department xray and penetrant tested and this one girl shined big time above the rest of her class.... so much so our company gave her a job offer and she was not even done with tech school yet
[2025-01-27T03:49:29] Matthew: <photos/photo_21119@27-01-2025_03-49-29.jpg>
[2025-01-27T03:49:31] Matthew: <photos/photo_21120@27-01-2025_03-49-31.jpg>
[2025-01-27T03:49:35] Matthew: <photos/photo_21121@27-01-2025_03-49-35.jpg>
[2025-01-27T03:49:39] Matthew: <photos/photo_21122@27-01-2025_03-49-39.jpg>
[2025-01-27T03:49:39] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Matthew has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-27T03:53:47] Noname: Hilarious part is they were the dirtiest workers. Just covered in grease. Even the machinist girl was an oil slob but they can't take the work load everyday
[2025-01-27T03:57:49] Matthew: <photos/photo_21123@27-01-2025_03-57-49.jpg>
[2025-01-27T03:57:58] Matthew: <photos/photo_21124@27-01-2025_03-57-58.jpg>
[2025-01-27T03:58:13] haku: nice man!
[2025-01-27T03:58:31] haku: how many hours of work to weld those
[2025-01-27T03:58:50] Matthew: Those are watertight doors for a military ship engine room. They are explosion and fireproof
[2025-01-27T03:59:19] Matthew: ~12hrs to tack and weld complete.
[2025-01-27T03:59:31] haku: wow
[2025-01-27T03:59:39] haku: bunker doors
[2025-01-27T03:59:55] Matthew: Before I was able to put the door together we had to cut, bevel, and prep all parts to be welded
[2025-01-27T04:01:54] Matthew: I was actually in Germany trying to help this company catch up on production and hopefully train a new welder to take my spot. How do they say? " everyone wants to be a welder until time to do welder shit"" lol
[2025-01-27T04:02:40] Matthew: We get paid for a skill, but depending on the job, the money comes from trying to not die
[2025-01-27T04:03:06] Matthew: Unless you're in a spot that makes smaller aerospace and semiconductor parts
[2025-01-27T04:03:26] Noname: I would not want to weld for a living
[2025-01-27T04:03:32] Noname: F that
[2025-01-27T04:05:05] Matthew: I've been burnt out since year #3 probably. And granted I had a few escapades of being drunk and not working for a couple year because of it... I don't recommend welding as a career
[2025-01-27T04:06:52] haku: good $$ ive heard
[2025-01-27T04:06:56] Noname: 50$/h cash in the summer heat and trash swill that'll give you a random infection. The money's great I can't deal with the heat
[2025-01-27T04:07:29] haku: pays more than some nurses get paid here
[2025-01-27T04:07:56] haku: you have to persue what you like man
[2025-01-27T04:08:02] Noname: I don't like people or heat. I'll just be an assembler forever
[2025-01-27T04:08:32] haku: im a proffessional bum. and i only do 2 things. you know what it is
[2025-01-27T04:09:06] Noname: How do you get into that. I want to be one
[2025-01-27T04:09:17] haku: just get swole amd do projects
[2025-01-27T04:09:50] Noname: Swole sounds like work. I want to just exist and sit quietly
[2025-01-27T04:11:07] haku: i actually might do food deliveries since i want to get paod riding my projects. you know active income
[2025-01-27T04:11:27] Noname: Sounds fun
[2025-01-27T04:11:34] Matthew: DIY garage. My buddy did that in Miami. You sit there and business comes to you. You answer a few questions and other than that it's the customers problem if anything happens
[2025-01-27T04:12:22] Noname: He had a shop and people came to use it lol that's cool
[2025-01-27T04:12:37] Matthew: I've about literally died in Florida mid summer inferno. 2 people died in 1 week from heat
[2025-01-27T04:12:43] haku: i still need to pay this dam ticket.
[2025-01-27T04:12:53] haku: las vegas dry heat also bad
[2025-01-27T04:13:19] Noname: I can't even stand still in Florida nevermind welding leathers
[2025-01-27T04:13:24] Matthew: Exactly. He just provided tools and a bay to work in. Daily, weekly, monthly rates
[2025-01-27T04:15:02] haku: you need leather suit for welding?
[2025-01-27T04:15:17] haku: ebike guy does it with a t shirt
[2025-01-27T04:15:40] Noname: You can use a t.shirt for tacks but yeah welding splatter hurts
[2025-01-27T04:15:46] Noname: It gives you a suntan
[2025-01-27T04:16:48] Noname: Depends I don't have any for sheetmetal at home but that trailer job yeah and leather boots. Molten metal in a tennis shoe sucks
[2025-01-27T04:17:13] Noname: Worst was a blob in my ear
[2025-01-27T04:17:22] haku: crocs safe im sure. you need ventilation to disipate body heat
[2025-01-27T04:17:37] haku: its closed toes
[2025-01-27T04:17:38] Noname: If you like plastic melted to skin sure
[2025-01-27T04:18:43] Noname: Depends heavy plate welding is a nightmare. My lil projects arnt bad but you'll burn poke holes in clothing
[2025-01-27T04:18:48] haku: what exact model ant is it?
[2025-01-27T04:19:31] Mattia: 22PHB1TB230A
[2025-01-27T04:19:41] haku: you have 2 red wires. never seen that
[2025-01-27T04:19:43] Matthew: Dude, the tip of my nose, an eyelid, my fat lips, slag popping off the wrld and stick itself to my parts of skin
[2025-01-27T04:20:11] Mattia: Idk
[2025-01-27T04:20:22] Mattia: This is my first battery pack
[2025-01-27T04:20:37] Noname: Yep all fun just protect the Jewls at all cost
[2025-01-27T04:20:56] Matthew: So many different levels of welding. High heat confined space pays well, but you just may die from heatstroke
[2025-01-27T04:21:17] haku: gotcha. all good i burned my first one too. 16s because wired bad
[2025-01-27T04:21:44] Mattia: the connections are well made
[2025-01-27T04:21:49] Mattia: And correct
[2025-01-27T04:22:01] Mattia: I think is the bms the problem
[2025-01-27T04:22:14] Noname: <animation>
[2025-01-27T04:22:38] Noname: Can't be hot if your wet
[2025-01-27T04:22:39] Matthew: We were told be in the hole for no longer than 15 minutes. I was drinking a 32oz Gatorade every 30 minutes and would not piss a drop for a 12hrs shift
[2025-01-27T04:22:54] Matthew: Buzzzzzzzzz
[2025-01-27T04:23:42] Noname: It's great when the sweat starts stinging and you get a rash.
[2025-01-27T04:23:53] Noname: 1 hr in to the day
[2025-01-27T04:24:19] Noname: Let's not scare Haku. Welding at home is fun
[2025-01-27T04:24:43] Noname: Just don't look at it without a shield
[2025-01-27T04:27:46] Matthew: Bro, shipyard..Tampa in mid July. My gloves and tant all sweat through and the whole ship is a ground... I was needing to cut out a weld carbon arc gouge. I sit down. I grab a rod. And when I went to attach the rod to the stinger. Yes, i grounded out through my gloves and taint. Fuck that hurt
[2025-01-27T04:28:49] Matthew: The war stories. Honestly be safe and you'll have fun. When you're paid to go kill yourself is when it's not really fun anymore
[2025-01-27T04:30:18] Matthew: This is also all in my first yr of welding
[2025-01-27T04:30:30] Matthew: Been in the bs for ~20yrs now
[2025-01-27T04:41:31] Noname: Don't drink fluids no sweat not conductive problem solved
[2025-01-27T06:06:50] Ev Pro World: You need to set the parameters
[2025-01-27T08:15:03] Yamal: We continue in January..! this month seems to have no end

[2025-01-27T08:32:33] GABE: They don't know what telemetry is. But that they will
[2025-01-27T08:33:38] GABE: LOL WHAT

[2025-01-27T08:52:56] Jan: Something is not right with the US Dollar since covid. Suddenly salaries and prices went up like crazy. Everybody seems to make suddenly 2-3x of swiss salaries which where the highest in the world. But still due to some unknown reasons the Dollae hasnt devalued as much as it should. 0.9$ = 1CHF but it should be more like 0.3-0.5$=1CHF
[2025-01-27T08:55:03] Yamal: Means US okay ?
[2025-01-27T08:55:19] Yamal: My cousin is there xD
[2025-01-27T08:57:38] Yamal: With the covid they tried to sneak a goal in, but we realized, right now they were planning to shoot at goal again 🤙
[2025-01-27T08:59:37] Yamal: My advice is not to believe anything you see on TV, and even less from a politician, it doesn't matter which side they are on, they are all scum.

[2025-01-27T10:16:18] Jan: 🤷
[2025-01-27T10:19:56] Andrei Albert: Worked my ass off to be an engineer ang get paid as much as a crane operator, shitty Romania

[2025-01-27T13:37:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Motor cable through here?

[2025-01-27T13:50:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_21132@27-01-2025_13-50-19.jpg>
[2025-01-27T13:53:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I think I'll remove a bit of the spacer and let the cable go up sooner
[2025-01-27T13:53:41] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Shlomozero10🇮🇱 has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-27T13:53:49] GABE: Fix it

[2025-01-27T21:46:37] NetworkDir: <animation>
[2025-01-27T21:46:49] haku: good idea
[2025-01-27T21:47:43] haku: i will charge my own batteries
[2025-01-27T21:52:21] Yamal: How good it is to train! I miss my vacations with morning training..
[2025-01-27T21:53:18] haku: its really not training for something. its a routine for me tbh
[2025-01-27T21:53:53] haku: when i use to really train for competitions the pace was alot harder. now i take long breaks
[2025-01-27T21:58:40] haku: cutting weight for weigh ins is the toughest shit. need to shit/sweat out 20lbs in a 2day span. then gain it all back next day
[2025-01-27T22:01:35] Yamal: you live the life of a bodybuilder
[2025-01-27T22:02:01] haku: nono. never. it was mma/bjj/wrestling
[2025-01-27T22:02:29] haku: body building is a whole different beast. not really into that back then
[2025-01-27T22:02:29] Yamal: Your refrigerator won't have two doors too, right?
[2025-01-27T22:03:16] haku: body building is impressive but imo thats not a sport but a beautypagent for men
[2025-01-27T22:04:07] haku: now im into it. round swole muscles look good
[2025-01-27T22:04:39] Felix: It's still on so everything good
[2025-01-27T22:04:50] Yamal: The trend of judges in Mr. Olympia has been changing for a long time
[2025-01-27T22:05:33] haku: yea. its like freakishly huge olympia.
[2025-01-27T22:06:30] Yamal: In my opinion, muscular grandeur is no longer sought so much without equity.
[2025-01-27T22:06:39] haku: i like more freak sports like strongman. fat dudes who lift heavy stuff
[2025-01-27T22:06:57] Yamal: Now perfection and muscular balance are sought a lot.
[2025-01-27T22:07:38] Yamal: an example was the Jamaican that I won a few years ago
[2025-01-27T22:08:08] haku: nothing is impossible nowadays. with all the ghormones and juice available. the knowledge is out there. proper diet and workouts
[2025-01-27T22:08:33] haku: ofcourse genetics play a factor to those competitions too
[2025-01-27T22:11:25] haku: i dont follow olympia. but huge respect to what they do
[2025-01-27T22:15:38] Yamal: I don't follow them either, but some year I find out who wins and so on...
[2025-01-27T22:23:54] haku: should i go by this disguise when i fight crime?
[2025-01-27T22:24:42] haku: or too obviious?
[2025-01-27T22:25:58] haku: im thinking of a disguise when i ride my bike. to blend in
[2025-01-27T22:28:47] Yamal: I think that with that hat you can party in Thailand.
[2025-01-27T22:29:03] haku: you think if i talk to amy looking like this ill get a bigger discount?
[2025-01-27T22:30:13] Yamal: Kung fu panda
[2025-01-27T22:30:30] haku: my crime fighting words when i kick them will be "ni hao bitches!"
[2025-01-27T22:31:29] Yamal: Seriously, with that hat you can go wherever you want, they will open doors for you anywhere
[2025-01-27T22:32:05] haku: good idea. ill make a video inside trump towers getting swole with this
[2025-01-27T22:33:17] Yamal: The hat is cool!
[2025-01-27T22:33:28] haku: i bet if i wore this when ingot pulled over i wouldnt get a ticket
[2025-01-27T22:34:09] haku: can you imagine me in the highway with this hat. aerodynamic
[2025-01-27T22:34:51] haku: in the highway "somewhere in mexico" btw
[2025-01-27T22:34:52] Yamal: A vacation with that hat must be tremendous!
[2025-01-27T22:36:28] haku: in the summer here i will need this hat
[2025-01-27T22:38:50] Yamal: The people there are amazed by you in the summer, with the Tesla and that hat, It's like Zeus in Monaco

[2025-01-28T05:00:13] Arnau Martinez Casals: It can be the fw on the esc? cause im using the limited one i think
[2025-01-28T05:09:34] Jason: could be too much current for motor or not well tuned setup
[2025-01-28T05:12:06] Noname: Damn tempting for 600$ needs a tune up

[2025-01-28T05:54:07] Noname: Why would I spend 3g to make it electric
[2025-01-28T05:54:19] Noname: It'll do 80 and prob 80mpg

[2025-01-28T09:01:42] Yamal: Likewise, you have a lot of e-scooters with Vesc, it would be cool if when you take them out for a ride, you share data from the Vesc tool and so on, to our delight :)

[2025-01-28T15:36:55] Yamal: with the plus of getting real 130kmh easily it is great
[2025-01-28T15:39:45] Yamal: What is your battery and phase configuration,,?0

[2025-01-28T16:27:48] haku: @jamessoderstrom i think carry em
[2025-01-28T16:29:02] haku: isnt this teverun 13"
[2025-01-28T16:42:30] Matte: I'm fine with used, I just have a feeling these stock motors won't want to even take 100A phase lol. Those phase wires are tiny.
[2025-01-28T17:01:33] JPPL: It's costum build
[2025-01-28T17:08:55] Dualtron Achilleus: Why?
[2025-01-28T17:27:42] Yamal: I was just asking, but thinking about it, I think that anyone has ridden or tested 22/3, since most "large" e-scooters come from the factory with 22/3
[2025-01-28T17:58:42] ✨🇪🇸عمر: <video_file>
[2025-01-28T17:59:10] ✨🇪🇸عمر: yes in the meantime I'm switching to 100v100a for a few days
[2025-01-28T17:59:31] ✨🇪🇸عمر: I take the opportunity to put a real BMS on my 28ah
[2025-01-28T18:57:25] haku: how about 17x4? on smaller scooter
[2025-01-28T18:57:34] haku: or bike
[2025-01-28T18:58:14] Yamal: Nami come with 17/4
[2025-01-28T18:58:39] haku: isnt that good? no need for big dick battery?
[2025-01-28T19:00:24] JPPL: So pretty
[2025-01-28T19:01:05] Yamal: Big controller/ big battery ,, 17/4 for what ? XD
[2025-01-28T19:01:05] haku: wow thats custom rim for LY?
[2025-01-28T19:01:17] Yamal: Expensive ..
[2025-01-28T19:01:33] Yamal: Rage/ Raphael cheaper..
[2025-01-28T19:01:48] haku: thats what i mean. small controller and small battery for 17x4. just for burnouts and daily
[2025-01-28T19:02:26] Yamal: But very nice , they sale in red color too right
[2025-01-28T19:02:48] haku: how much those custom milled rims cost?
[2025-01-28T19:04:37] Yamal: https://fastride.fr/fr/fastride/3563-jante-fastride-racing.html
[2025-01-28T19:04:42] haku: can someone make custom made spinner rims for a scooter
[2025-01-28T19:05:44] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Bro I'm on 22/3 why disappoint me
[2025-01-28T19:06:11] Yamal: Of the few that sell cnc wheels, I would say it is the most expensive
[2025-01-28T19:08:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I think my wolf motors are 22/3
[2025-01-28T19:08:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: As I was told
[2025-01-28T19:08:55] haku: i dont think any production scooter comes with 33x2. someone correct me on this
[2025-01-28T19:09:15] haku: the battery and the esc needed to power it is $$$
[2025-01-28T19:12:40] Dualtron Achilleus: For two motor of the same size but different KV : Hight Kv motor need more amp to have the same torque as a lower KW one Low KV motor need more tension/voltage to reach the same speed as the hight KV motor
[2025-01-28T19:13:38] haku: can yoi explain tension? voltage?
[2025-01-28T19:13:55] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah voltage
[2025-01-28T19:15:47] haku: what if you add more voltage to high KV motor?
[2025-01-28T19:17:51] haku: what is the bleeding edge right now for scooters? 33x2 80h, high discharge battery and big vesc?
[2025-01-28T19:18:16] Jan: A lot
[2025-01-28T19:18:35] Jan: Depending on size, material 150-300$ per piece production
[2025-01-28T19:19:17] haku: wow. if i want that made i want a wide lip on my scooter
[2025-01-28T19:19:24] Jan: Bleeding edge is not available in the scooter industry right now unless you make it yourself. The tech is already out for years
[2025-01-28T19:19:56] Jan: The costly thing isnt the end product, its the R&D to make a final product
[2025-01-28T19:20:09] haku: i see
[2025-01-28T19:20:23] Jan: Maybe you have 3-4 prototypes machined until you have what you want
[2025-01-28T19:20:30] Jan: Easily low 4 digit
[2025-01-28T19:20:35] Jan: For the trash
[2025-01-28T19:20:38] haku: golly.
[2025-01-28T19:20:54] haku: scooter culture in EU is crazy
[2025-01-28T19:21:09] haku: its like the ebike/surron culture here
[2025-01-28T19:22:15] haku: youre right. everything is cookie cutter style builds now
[2025-01-28T19:22:22] Jan: This is gonna cost me also 600-800$ until i have it right. I can assure that people who take the time and spend the money on it dont wanna release it for free afterwards
[2025-01-28T19:25:34] JPPL: Tell us more
[2025-01-28T19:27:17] haku: this is bleeding edge. imo
[2025-01-28T19:27:49] haku: you will bleed if you fall of an edge
[2025-01-28T19:27:53] haku: hehe
[2025-01-28T19:28:05] Jan: What do you wanna know?
[2025-01-28T19:28:29] Jan: Its Tubeless Splitrim with disc brake mount
[2025-01-28T19:28:52] Jan: <animation>
[2025-01-28T19:31:30] JPPL: 10" no hub I see ;) strong shape
[2025-01-28T19:50:38] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): P0rnHub?
[2025-01-28T20:09:08] haku: lawd thats a big scooter. https://youtu.be/4VfrmWyIR_s?si=_uduPHL2sdHHiALL
[2025-01-28T20:09:28] haku: american size
[2025-01-28T20:10:12] haku: i dont see the point in this tbh. who will buy this?
[2025-01-28T20:11:01] haku: if this comes out in my local pev shop ill check what motors and stuff they use
[2025-01-28T20:11:55] haku: not hating on the thing just saying
[2025-01-28T20:11:56] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-28T20:13:16] JPPL: I enjoy it, seems strong, a lot of views/attention since CES 2205
[2025-01-28T20:14:29] haku: this scooter makes 13" look like 10"
[2025-01-28T20:26:44] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): V6.06 Latst build 🥰
[2025-01-28T20:26:44] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): FOC overmodulation factor. Allows slightly higher speed at the expense of output voltage distortion. A factor of 1.15 results in a modulated hexagon, similar to trapezoidal commutation. Generally it does not make sense to go higher than 1.15
[2025-01-28T20:28:03] Jason: mmm
[2025-01-28T20:28:11] Jason: phase shape go hexagon
[2025-01-28T20:28:27] Jason: I wonder what shfw overmodulation looks like
[2025-01-28T20:28:37] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-01-28T20:29:34] Jason: murican sjze

[2025-01-28T20:58:16] haku: yea wtf rose. only 1 post then censor? you racist bitch
[2025-01-28T21:01:00] Marius: The censoring is Getting out of Hand...
[2025-01-28T21:08:13] haku: while scooters getting bigger amd adding pegs and seats. while bikes getting smaller. it will meet in the middle. either you go midrive or dual hubs. https://youtu.be/pD5xPD-yU3I?si=kP1cXyftJzBJj92Z
[2025-01-28T21:09:55] haku: i think thats the trend im seeing personally
[2025-01-28T21:16:38] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Damn loaded the latest beta ..... turned FW off motor runs 93km/h, turned overmod on motor runs 104km/h, added 40A FW motor runs 127
[2025-01-28T21:19:05] Jan: That 40A goes 0% into more power for the motor
[2025-01-28T21:23:46] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Yeah but adds bit more speed at the end with loss of torque
[2025-01-28T21:24:30] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): In normal drive i notice a gain of about 15Km/h from FW
[2025-01-28T22:43:23] 'lekrsu': Shfw had it first
[2025-01-28T22:44:07] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): <photos/photo_21156@28-01-2025_22-44-07.jpg>
[2025-01-28T22:44:17] 'lekrsu': I guess he got inspiration from Voxque
[2025-01-28T22:45:56] 'lekrsu': Without fwk, (because it makes it irrelevant imo), how much louder is your motor with ovm?
[2025-01-28T22:46:33] 'lekrsu': You'll likely see a speed increase in percentage equal to your increased power draw.
[2025-01-28T22:46:37] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): cant test now will make tomorrow audio recordings
[2025-01-28T22:47:43] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): When my scooter drives 110km/h the last thing i worry about is power draw (aka efficiency)🤣
[2025-01-29T01:46:06] JPPL: When its low Gravity center
[2025-01-29T02:07:23] haku: trans dogs get free food in america.

[2025-01-29T02:32:48] haku: does 33x2 motor have more rpms than 22x3?
[2025-01-29T02:55:16] JPPL: Yes
[2025-01-29T02:57:29] JPPL: 22*3 Its torque dedicated, 33*2 is speed
[2025-01-29T03:12:27] haku: wait 22x3 has more torque but 33x2 spins more rpms yea?
[2025-01-29T03:12:58] haku: im not really familiar with windings. and how rps are calculated depending on winding
[2025-01-29T03:38:35] JPPL: Exactly

[2025-01-29T07:35:59] j j: Need your help, I'm looking for a lighting system for a croquet or electric bike, but I need the system to have a high-beam flash in the headlight via a button or lever, like cars have, so I can signal to someone coming in front of me, has anyone encountered something like this?

[2025-01-29T07:40:36] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Now thats a nice looking screen! Beefy price although but seems they did quite some work for it. Whats not clear if it would work CAN only (Since the UART is already in use)
[2025-01-29T08:56:21] GABE: You'll usually be the one passing them. And sure, just make a MOSFET switch.
[2025-01-29T08:56:45] GABE: Make a little lever and bam
[2025-01-29T08:57:28] GABE: Adorable.
[2025-01-29T09:53:27] GABE: We had an African grey for over a decade, she was a family member. was devastating when she flew out as she was scared.
[2025-01-29T09:53:58] GABE: She was so home tamed never left with all the doors open etc. She had trust umongst us.

[2025-01-29T11:02:25] Matte: stupidly expensive
[2025-01-29T11:07:45] Dualtron Achilleus: More speed like torque one
[2025-01-29T11:49:23] JPPL: Its more: Ambrosini looks the same than this with rebrand. Ir can work with can or uart, have borh connections
[2025-01-29T12:10:18] ✨🇪🇸عمر: kaabo power 😔😔😔

[2025-01-29T13:12:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I tried opening from the opposite side didn't managed to
[2025-01-29T13:19:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like only from disk side then need to pull motor through and I don't like that
[2025-01-29T13:20:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also the wolf has 2 types of motors 1200w And 2000w I have the first (but it also had bolts from both sides

[2025-01-30T16:59:01] Yamal: Hello i have a question, the accelerator in ubox is the 7-pin one, what were the colors used?
[2025-01-30T17:23:02] Patrick: Friends, some of you stay around that places?
[2025-01-30T17:28:14] Matte: Zagreb
[2025-01-30T17:30:12] haku: why so many topics here now?
[2025-01-30T17:30:29] haku: off topic is the one topic to rule them all
[2025-01-30T17:31:19] Patrick: Yeah because i will test my vesc setup up to 3000km and want meet with people around that tour 🙂
[2025-01-30T17:31:56] Patrick: Yeah also Nami Croatia is based in Zagreb, i write with them for meet maybe 🙂
[2025-01-30T17:33:48] haku: i mean the vesc chat. theres 10 topics. general, offtopic, veschelp, buy and sell, mastubating adiction help, world views etc
[2025-01-30T17:59:35] francois schempers: we added a topic to sell or buy things, a topic to easily find trusted seller if you don't want the hassle of not being scamed, and we thought a topic to give feedback about sellers would be nice, everything still works the same, same topics for chatting with same rules, the added topic is just for selling stuff
[2025-01-30T17:59:56] haku: gotcha. thanks bro!
[2025-01-30T18:00:41] haku: what is feedback reputation? is that for vendors only?
[2025-01-30T18:03:32] francois schempers: examples, you buy goods from someone, if you get a bad exchange, or got scam, you can tell about it and help others better choose their vendor, if you buy from James and was pleased with the goods and service, you can also tell about it, to help futur transactions and build trust
[2025-01-30T18:04:06] haku: gotcha! good idea it will be documented
[2025-01-30T18:04:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I think @jamessoderstrom should be automatically in the trusted sellers

[2025-01-30T18:07:06] francois schempers: you can also tag an admin and ask to be posted on the group reals, would be the ultimate swole

[2025-01-30T18:18:41] GABE: It means I'm a valid vendor
[2025-01-30T18:19:01] GABE: Because people can vouch for me not being a scamming shit

[2025-01-30T18:21:57] haku: i only sell services to locals. 😜
[2025-01-30T18:22:16] Noname: What kind of service?
[2025-01-30T18:22:30] haku: depends on the $$

[2025-01-30T19:13:15] francois schempers: it will be a different bot ;)
[2025-01-30T19:13:45] francois schempers: I'll also think of a bot to count reputation points in the reputation topic
[2025-01-30T19:14:22] Yamal: put dreadlocks on him!!
[2025-01-30T19:15:44] Yamal: By the way, I see you more active than ever, Mr. Owner, perhaps the VESC era is about to explode
[2025-01-30T19:16:57] haku: it will. trust and believe
[2025-01-30T19:17:26] Yamal: don't add flipsky to your scheme and you might survive xD
[2025-01-30T19:19:59] Yamal: I'm joking, haku rider, each person is a world, and each of us has a thousand pending stories, work, family, what to do, and vesc is just the connection key to disconnect from worldly life.

[2025-01-30T19:25:03] haku: makes me really wonder tbh. the technology gap from roman age to medieval age is alot of centuries. but from industrial revolution to modern day we get microchips. i wonder where we got that tech from
[2025-01-30T19:25:47] francois schempers: I had some professional opportunities I had to see through, now that it's done I have more time to hang around and do stuff 😁

[2025-01-30T22:49:09] haku: i mean youtube setup look at the camera pointed down to the table. i was making a video but cutoff at 30min mark. sucks
[2025-01-30T22:49:46] Noname: Traxxas = instant poverty
[2025-01-30T22:51:39] Noname: Dude crawling is no joke now. I just watched a truck drive around a cliff of a rock with 1 tire then got on top
[2025-01-30T22:51:49] Matte: http://www.mjxrc.net/goodshow/10208-10208-brushless-3s-4s-color-black.html

[2025-01-30T22:53:33] haku: i poor dude. i cant afford fancy branded toys for my kid. walmart brand is enough he will not know the difference
[2025-01-30T22:54:01] Noname: Cybertruck RC Cars Alloy Truck https://a.co/d/46PWogg
[2025-01-30T22:54:08] Matte: you will when walmart brand breaks after you sneeze on it and there are 0 replacement parts
[2025-01-30T22:54:59] Noname: I literally broke my Tmaxx every time I used it
[2025-01-30T22:55:17] Matte: cause its traxxas lol
[2025-01-30T22:55:19] haku: he doesnt even play it. if he gets a liking to it maybe i would. right now he likes bikes and minecraft
[2025-01-30T22:56:47] Noname: I have an obsession I need to build it with aluminum and that's the worst material
[2025-01-30T22:57:06] haku: em i too messy if everytime i solder i leave this much flux
[2025-01-30T22:57:27] Noname: Crime scene
[2025-01-30T22:58:23] Matte: but to be honest, rc cars are like that
[2025-01-30T22:58:37] Noname: I'm actually annoyed just talking about rc trucks
[2025-01-30T22:58:49] Noname: Smallest screws ever
[2025-01-30T22:59:24] Noname: Basically you perpetually fix them look at them and drive em for 5 min

[2025-01-30T23:00:49] haku: ive seen those in the park. pretty cool
[2025-01-30T23:00:52] Noname: I build a steel frame with weed eater motor
[2025-01-30T23:01:06] haku: the guy brought ramps
[2025-01-30T23:01:13] Matte: electric are just faster than gas
[2025-01-30T23:01:14] Matte: lighter too
[2025-01-30T23:01:44] Noname: I still want to make an rc kids ATV
[2025-01-30T23:01:46] GABE: The gas Vs electric debate was very funny back then
[2025-01-30T23:01:58] Matte: gas turned to nitro vs electric
[2025-01-30T23:02:13] GABE: Only pro with nitro was able to carry a bottle
[2025-01-30T23:02:17] Matte: but then when you see guys trying to start their nitro for 10 minutes
[2025-01-30T23:02:27] GABE: LITERALLY 20 MINUTES LOL

[2025-01-30T23:03:03] Matte: its cool and all, and i understand why some like them
[2025-01-30T23:03:11] GABE: Then my brushless slammmer just pop the switch and bam
[2025-01-30T23:03:28] GABE: It's cause it's cool no pun intended
[2025-01-30T23:04:11] Noname: I still carry my tmaxx piston 20yrs later
[2025-01-30T23:04:28] Matte: anyone wants to know what happens when theres scooter amount of power in an rc car

[2025-01-31T01:49:33] haku: is it possible to make an aluminum board but with tolt mosfets? just for durability and extra cooling?
[2025-01-31T01:49:57] haku: cooled both sides
[2025-01-31T02:08:19] haku: gotcha
[2025-01-31T02:32:05] haku: you going to buy one?
[2025-01-31T05:44:06] Ev Pro World: Nice
[2025-01-31T06:02:52] Yamal: Finish the week , finally finish the month
[2025-01-31T06:03:46] Yamal: and the almond trees are in bloom, there is less left for spring
[2025-01-31T06:03:47] haku: dualtron when?
[2025-01-31T06:04:06] Yamal: Man waiting for the frame arrive
[2025-01-31T06:05:00] Yamal: but the project is going to be slowed down, I need to save for plane flights etc etc etc
[2025-01-31T06:07:00] haku: fly to china. check out factory
[2025-01-31T06:07:32] haku: i want to do that one of these days
[2025-01-31T06:08:36] Yamal: do it! Afterwards you can go to the Philippines to visit the family xD
[2025-01-31T06:09:51] Yamal: I intend to travel to Asia in May if everything goes well, but I will only be there for a few days, I'm only going to pick up my family back.
[2025-01-31T06:09:55] haku: i need a china speaking fella to tramslate
[2025-01-31T06:11:24] haku: a real china man that knows how chinese works. these people only conduct buissness and gives better deals with thier own
[2025-01-31T06:12:01] Yamal: Ningbo calls me from China,
[2025-01-31T06:13:16] Yamal: I mean Michael is there..
[2025-01-31T06:14:24] haku: learning china language is also cool. i had a buddy did that just because. he learned from an app and went to talk to chinese in chinatown everytime he can
[2025-01-31T06:16:22] haku: i think now he works concierge in a 5star china hotel
[2025-01-31T06:16:27] Yamal: your passion for China is tremendous!!
[2025-01-31T06:16:39] Yamal: How your spintend going ,,?
[2025-01-31T06:17:31] haku: good just made a video earlier soldering qs8 and bullets but video cut off at 30mins.

[2025-01-31T06:17:51] Yamal: But your really repair
[2025-01-31T06:18:08] haku: no. just soldering connectors
[2025-01-31T06:18:27] haku: and talk a bunch of bs
[2025-01-31T06:23:03] Yamal: and cow girld, is anyone out in the neighborhood? If she has money, even better! Can you imagine a wealthy cowgirl falling in love with you? You won't be short of Molicel/Eve cells and regional vesc... tell her that you're too lazy to pay customs, better local vesc! x12 and seven controller
[2025-01-31T06:24:46] haku: no cowgirls here only whalegirls
[2025-01-31T06:26:31] Yamal: nothing happens, we are totally adaptive, with the "sine" wave we just as likely put on a cowboy hat as we put on fisherman's clothes.
[2025-01-31T06:27:13] Yamal: As Bruce Lee said "be water my friend"
[2025-01-31T06:28:58] haku: lately everytime i go into aliexpress my feed is filled with fardrivers. the demons are whispering sweet nothing to my ears. help me yamal. cleanse me of these thoughts
[2025-01-31T06:31:03] Yamal: vesc is much more than a pure wave without cuts
[2025-01-31T06:31:24] Yamal: It is the heritage of a Viking
[2025-01-31T06:32:08] Yamal: After meeting Vesc, I don't want or think about anything else.
[2025-01-31T06:32:37] Yamal: If it is not natural VESC, I prefer to walk
[2025-01-31T06:33:52] haku: the demons said power comes in bigger forms. help me benjamin
[2025-01-31T06:35:17] Yamal: VESC is Monaco, and fardriver province of Yucatan
[2025-01-31T06:37:17] Yamal: Vesc are blonde girls with blue eyes and fardriver cave trolls
[2025-01-31T06:38:14] haku: thank you for snaping me back to reality.
[2025-01-31T06:38:19] Yamal: What is missing from your controller to work correctly?
[2025-01-31T06:39:07] haku: cooling. but i never go on speed runs anymore so vesc runs cool just riding normal speeds
[2025-01-31T06:44:13] Yamal: I think speed is not the problem,,
[2025-01-31T06:45:00] haku: i can feel it can reach 90mph. but cooling is not good
[2025-01-31T06:45:11] haku: 81 i think is my fastest
[2025-01-31T06:45:38] haku: but i dont care im not riding the highway anymore 😜
[2025-01-31T06:46:54] haku: i talked to a bunch of surron boys earlier. they said non of em ever got pulled over

[2025-01-31T08:16:43] Yamal: don't make yourself too tight

[2025-01-31T08:41:32] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): As you might have heard the VESC Bridge V2 is coming soon. Since there are many changes and the V1 had a massive limit in available memory we have decided to create the V2 version from scratch. This means no upgrade path available for the V1's but involves new hardware. First of all what is the VESC bridge ..... VESC bridge was originally made for the Segway GT1 & GT2 to be able to use VESC controllers but still keep most of the stock functions working. So at the end your dash, RGB, lights and even the original app kept working but you could use much more powerful speed controllers. Also you where able to convert a GT1 single motor to dual motor with it and it has some extra feature that are controlled by it's own VESC Bridge App (PowerNine). Here you where able to set power settings for each motor and define the speed for each driving mode. It could let a dual motor GT1 boot into 2WD mode and provided as hidden function a way to switch to 1 or 2 motors. Also it has a speed regulated mode where the scooter boots into speed limit mode and via hidden function this could be activated and would activate always when you where in a certain mode. The V1 bridge can do much more but would be a long list :). Anyway V2 is on it's way and like V1 it provides a plug & play solution to have VESC in your scooter but now it's not limited anymore to just the Segway GT1 & GT2 but also Ninebot G30 & G2 is now supported (Different bridge hardware for each although). With plug and play we mean take out original esc add VESC(s) and plug the original cables into the Bridge and hook up the bridge to the main VESC and done. (Note except Hall cable & Motor cable) What features will V2 have (some might be delayed or skipped) - Total redesigned hardware with own power stage (VESC 5V is a mess) - OTA firmware upgrades - Stock battery support & Unlock BMS for G30 (GT series is under investigation) - Real anti theft mode that locks the motors fully (using Handbrake function of VESC) - Power shifting (Torque curve) during first xx Km of speed where amps on front motor are reduced and given to rear motor (User adjustable) - DAC support for users that want to use the ADC function of VESC. No extra wiring required. - Cruise control support - Battery current Max regen per motor adjustable (v1 used same as regular motor current) - Speed regulated speeds & power adjustable (V1 was fixed) - RGB Function and Guard mode in Powernine app (Make it less dependent of Ninebot app) The might comes features: (no hard promise!) - Additional BMS support like JBD (Done), JK (WIP), Ant (WIP), Daly (WIP) - 2 inputs and 2 outputs to be able to add turn lights (G30, G2) - Per motor Battery & Phase settings (V1 could not set Battery amp per motor) When there are additions we will mention them in follow up posts. ETA for VESC Bridge V2 is roughly Mid April and the price is not fully clear yet but we expect not (much) more then the V1 bridge (+- 50 Euro + Shipping).

[2025-01-31T16:58:00] Morten Jensen: So I have to lower the motor amps
[2025-01-31T17:10:19] Morten Jensen: 70battery and 140 motor amps

[2025-01-31T18:04:48] Morten Jensen: Which parameters should I adjust?
[2025-01-31T18:09:47] haku: whoa. why is my commercial playing when i click the group.

[2025-01-31T20:03:14] Marius: @Bradhaku
[2025-01-31T20:03:20] Marius: the censorship...
[2025-01-31T20:05:45] Yamal: Which motor fits in the monorin fork that would be good for a Mijia, I have my brother's pending...
[2025-01-31T20:06:20] haku: is discord?
[2025-01-31T20:06:50] GABE: the stock motor is fine with no fwk bro
[2025-01-31T20:07:10] GABE: what motors do YOU have available for a monorim front?
[2025-01-31T20:07:13] Yamal: Little focer okee?
[2025-01-31T20:07:22] GABE: show
[2025-01-31T20:07:37] Yamal: It’s same 250 Tronic
[2025-01-31T20:08:15] GABE: keep the stock motor
[2025-01-31T20:08:20] Yamal: Still have one,, want to use on white Xiaomi
[2025-01-31T20:08:30] Marius: discord yes
[2025-01-31T20:08:38] Yamal: Maybe good battery right
[2025-01-31T20:08:49] Yamal: I mean make a good battery
[2025-01-31T20:08:52] GABE: need a new battery
[2025-01-31T20:08:55] GABE: yes.
[2025-01-31T20:09:07] Yamal: What type
[2025-01-31T20:09:08] GABE: 15-16s works best with little heat.
[2025-01-31T20:09:30] GABE: me 20s with temp sensor no fwk
[2025-01-31T20:09:54] Yamal: Where you mount the controller with 20s ….?
[2025-01-31T20:10:35] GABE: in the original location
[2025-01-31T20:10:52] GABE: battery is on the bottom of the scooter, laying on the plate.
[2025-01-31T20:12:36] JPPL: <photos/photo_21193@31-01-2025_20-12-36.jpg>

[2025-01-31T20:16:38] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-01-31T20:16:42] Yamal: You fit the battery up to the controller
[2025-01-31T20:16:52] Yamal: ROSE !!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!
[2025-01-31T20:19:17] GABE: G30 like clearance methinks.
[2025-01-31T20:19:45] GABE: 32.5mm spacer
[2025-01-31T20:21:23] Yamal: Mijia very practical for express travel
[2025-01-31T20:22:05] Marius: did u buy welder by now?
[2025-01-31T20:22:17] GABE: No this is being soldered with lead
[2025-01-31T20:22:36] GABE: Small enough to bring onto the bus, indeed why I chose this frame instead of Pro 2
[2025-01-31T20:22:38] Rose: Hey there Hghhgg, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-01-31T20:22:49] GABE: Lol
[2025-01-31T20:24:38] Yamal: Nice
[2025-01-31T20:25:06] Yamal: with a pro2 you go completely unnoticed
[2025-01-31T20:25:19] Yamal: that's a good thing
[2025-01-31T20:25:24] Eren: <video_file>
[2025-01-31T20:25:28] Eren: Any help
[2025-01-31T20:25:42] Yamal: Here it is prohibited to board e-scooters on means of transport.
[2025-01-31T20:26:00] Yamal: rose nock nock
[2025-01-31T21:03:04] haku: whos there?

[2025-01-31T21:25:02] Matte: then you go back to US chocolate and taste nothing but vomit lol
[2025-01-31T21:25:40] haku: theres some good ones. receese peanut butter cups i like
[2025-01-31T21:26:04] Matte: those are good, luckily its all peanut butter taste not the chocolate

[2025-01-31T22:08:33] francois schempers: buy a bag already 😂😂
[2025-01-31T22:09:34] Matte: he needs a 60 liter backpack

[2025-01-31T22:32:56] Eren: Now I have another problem
[2025-01-31T22:35:17] Eren: <video_file>
[2025-01-31T22:39:08] crimeware: Is it still under warranty?
[2025-01-31T22:54:37] Yamal: https://youtu.be/vGYPG4y9uaI?si=PjV2Paq2K9DmW5i1
[2025-01-31T22:55:12] haku: i cut it off. its too much once i eat one i have to eat the whole box.
[2025-01-31T22:55:52] haku: we working on projects. cant out project me boy! @SirModAlot
[2025-01-31T23:00:30] Mattia: can anyone tell me where i can buy these adapters online? are adapters for the kaboo wolf king gt to mount magura brake
[2025-01-31T23:01:52] Mattia: in the front wheel I was able to mount it by simply turning the engine backwards and putting the brake on the left, but in the back engine I can't do that

[2025-01-31T23:46:06] Yamal: Tomorrow I hope to go out on the route with the scooter
[2025-01-31T23:51:53] haku: it will be a while before ill ride the wepoor.
[2025-01-31T23:52:35] haku: Noname send me your 250. your not using you hoarder

[2025-01-31T23:58:05] haku: <video_file>
[2025-01-31T23:58:31] francois schempers: why is it soaked wet ? they are just kinda waterproof
[2025-01-31T23:59:05] francois schempers: you may have water that seeped in
[2025-02-01T00:00:14] haku: the aliens hacked my vesc
[2025-02-01T00:00:27] Yamal: What happen with wepoor
[2025-02-01T00:01:09] haku: maybe
[2025-02-01T00:01:29] haku: i set to 400 max current
[2025-02-01T00:01:36] haku: that bad?
[2025-02-01T00:01:40] haku: abs
[2025-02-01T00:03:17] haku: bms woke settings maybe
[2025-02-01T00:03:44] haku: yessir
[2025-02-01T00:03:54] haku: same one that scarred me for life
[2025-02-01T00:04:39] haku: <photos/photo_21202@01-02-2025_00-04-39.jpg>
[2025-02-01T00:04:45] Yamal: Time to get x12,,?
[2025-02-01T00:04:49] haku: short circuit
[2025-02-01T00:08:13] haku: yea. im sure i did. i ride wepoor like electric skateboard with spinny
[2025-02-01T00:08:21] haku: ebrake and throttle
[2025-02-01T00:09:51] Yamal: well much better than me,,, Some time ago I walked a kilometer on land with the wheels in different directions...
[2025-02-01T00:10:32] NetworkDir: Regen bms cutoff very bad
[2025-02-01T00:10:41] NetworkDir: Kill anything
[2025-02-01T00:12:05] NetworkDir: Charge over current is 100A and delay 5S For bms cut off 5sec 100A needed i don't think regen can make it
[2025-02-01T00:12:23] haku: i pinned it all the way i wanted tires to screech
[2025-02-01T00:12:59] haku: i ride like an idiot. my fault
[2025-02-01T00:13:20] NetworkDir: But mostly shouldn't cause kill idk..
[2025-02-01T00:13:25] NetworkDir: 33/3 motors ?
[2025-02-01T00:13:33] haku: yea 70h
[2025-02-01T00:14:18] NetworkDir: Seems high kV motors very bad idea for burnout or something Because their resistance very low and close to short circuit!
[2025-02-01T00:15:56] haku: i see. dam i shouldve got 22x3 if i only knew.
[2025-02-01T00:16:12] haku: im a burnout guy more than a speed guy
[2025-02-01T00:16:14] NetworkDir: Yes bro
[2025-02-01T00:16:28] haku: <video_file>
[2025-02-01T00:16:52] NetworkDir: Or make ebike with outrunner motor
[2025-02-01T00:17:08] haku: yea you meam midrive
[2025-02-01T00:17:16] haku: same thing yea
[2025-02-01T00:17:20] NetworkDir: Yeah chain power..
[2025-02-01T00:17:39] NetworkDir: You can find high nm torque motors on mid driver
[2025-02-01T00:17:46] NetworkDir: Very good for wheelie and burnout
[2025-02-01T00:17:50] haku: this wepoor costing too much trouble. tickets and blown vescs
[2025-02-01T00:18:07] NetworkDir: Unfortunately
[2025-02-01T00:19:22] 'lekrsu': discharge/lvl2/short all on the same value?
[2025-02-01T00:19:24] haku: ill get another powerstage. see if i can control my roding style
[2025-02-01T00:19:53] haku: yea. that bad?
[2025-02-01T00:20:12] 'lekrsu': Just makes little sense to me
[2025-02-01T00:20:33] 'lekrsu': Are you drawing close to 500A?
[2025-02-01T00:20:35] haku: i just crank it all up. i told you boys i will test
[2025-02-01T00:20:57] haku: balls to walls testing
[2025-02-01T00:21:07] 'lekrsu': This explains why you're seeing short protection rather than normal discharge protection every time.
[2025-02-01T00:21:07] haku: i believe so
[2025-02-01T00:21:25] haku: i see
[2025-02-01T00:21:35] 'lekrsu': Then discharge should a far bit above peak current, lvlv2 a lot further and short even further.
[2025-02-01T00:21:47] haku: gotcha
[2025-02-01T00:21:52] 'lekrsu': Maybe short protection won't allow charging and your vesc dies, is this true?
[2025-02-01T00:22:51] haku: no idea.
[2025-02-01T00:24:23] NetworkDir: Maybe yes
[2025-02-01T00:24:47] NetworkDir: Ant doesn't have logs for why cut off or something?
[2025-02-01T00:25:56] 'lekrsu': The why isn't reasonable when all three limits are set the same, it'll always log short.
[2025-02-01T00:25:59] haku: is x12 12 mosfets yea? prolly same power output as 85/250 but just cools better
[2025-02-01T00:26:48] haku: i never cleared my logs and its at page 200. i cant see it its lagging
[2025-02-01T00:27:05] 'lekrsu': Ant bms app is meh.
[2025-02-01T00:30:29] Eren: Yes
[2025-02-01T00:30:33] Eren: I think so
[2025-02-01T00:30:45] Eren: But it has been sleeping for like 5 months now
[2025-02-01T00:30:49] haku: so sad i really like how the wepoor rides and how fast it can go. need to replace powerstage
[2025-02-01T00:31:05] haku: maybe whole vesc. idk
[2025-02-01T00:31:07] Eren: Its soaked cause i was trying to test it
[2025-02-01T00:31:49] Eren: But on this video its weird cause when i accelerate or break it gives me an error
[2025-02-01T00:32:04] Eren: So I am 100% sure its water
[2025-02-01T00:33:31] Eren: <video_file>
[2025-02-01T00:33:32] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Hghhgg has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-02-01T00:36:48] haku: this will be the ultimate project. qs180 in this frame.
[2025-02-01T00:37:01] Smart Repair: Does anyone know what the 15Ah means? 6Ah per 10km is realistic. The 15Ah cannot be the consumption
[2025-02-01T00:40:03] Noname: We send you 2 stock g30 controllers for wepoor. Basically limp mode until you redeem yourself
[2025-02-01T00:41:43] haku: i wonder if the tarrifs already hit..
[2025-02-01T00:41:49] haku: im fucked if it did
[2025-02-01T00:45:16] Smart Repair: Phasen Ah, not Batt Ah
[2025-02-01T00:49:05] 'lekrsu': Are you sure? That could be reasonable. Source side it's return current_avg * count_time / 60.0 / 60.0; and is left without a comment when it's set as a val.ah()
[2025-02-01T00:49:34] haku: what should i set it next time
[2025-02-01T00:50:29] 'lekrsu': So high that it never engages.
[2025-02-01T00:50:45] haku: i see
[2025-02-01T00:50:56] haku: 500a lol
[2025-02-01T00:51:04] 'lekrsu': I regen 20A and leave it at 120A.
[2025-02-01T00:51:35] 'lekrsu': Stuff gets converted to smoke when regen is free
[2025-02-01T00:51:52] haku: i think i set my regen in vesc both battery and the other one -50
[2025-02-01T00:52:25] haku: so regen bad idea then
[2025-02-01T00:52:31] Smart Repair: Energy 485Wh / 82V = 5,9Ah The 15Ah can never be the battery current. Then I would only be able to go 25km with my 36Ah battery. All watt hour figures match 6Ah, not 15Ah
[2025-02-01T00:52:52] 'lekrsu': Regen is awesome, just don't let the bms turn charging off.
[2025-02-01T00:53:02] haku: gotcha
[2025-02-01T00:53:16] 'lekrsu': Smoothest braking power that there is
[2025-02-01T00:55:12] 'lekrsu': The app doesn't derive it from the same place.
[2025-02-01T00:57:32] haku: @jamaludin_algarnati
[2025-02-01T00:59:17] Smart Repair: definitely phase Ah. average phase current is 52A / 60 * 17Min = 14.73Ah
[2025-02-01T01:04:45] haku: i think burned vescs is a cheaper option that burnt motors.
[2025-02-01T01:05:33] haku: if you calculate cost. motors are pretty expensive. vesc is the cheapest part of the build
[2025-02-01T01:06:06] 'lekrsu': Mentioned it on the vesc Discord, the metric doesn't belong there
[2025-02-01T01:09:05] Finn: Almost ready for a rideout
[2025-02-01T01:12:26] 'lekrsu': Of course, so we already have an average phase. But phase hours.. aren't energy.
[2025-02-01T01:26:32] Smart Repair: thousands of users and no one has ever asked the question 🤣
[2025-02-01T01:28:33] GABE: Correct
[2025-02-01T01:28:54] GABE: Unless you have shuls or snth
[2025-02-01T01:36:42] GABE: Saved this message
[2025-02-01T01:42:40] Jan: People should not use phase amps for any energy calculation. Its not a constant, phase is a sine wave with a frequency
[2025-02-01T01:43:38] Jan: You would need to know a lot more than just the phase peak to calculate anything meaningful
[2025-02-01T01:43:52] Jan: Energy => Use whats in and out of battery
[2025-02-01T01:45:02] Jan: Correct me if im wrong
[2025-02-01T01:45:33] Jan: <photos/photo_21206@01-02-2025_01-45-33.jpg>
[2025-02-01T01:51:42] 'lekrsu': That's how your house outlets work, sure.
[2025-02-01T01:53:15] 'lekrsu': The amplitude is voltage and that's dependent on your rotation speed.
[2025-02-01T01:57:07] Finn: <photos/photo_21207@01-02-2025_01-57-07.jpg>
[2025-02-01T01:57:07] Finn: <photos/photo_21208@01-02-2025_01-57-07.jpg>
[2025-02-01T01:59:05] Jan: The left one yes unless you have heavy machinery plug
[2025-02-01T01:59:51] 'lekrsu': A modern building will have all three spread out.
[2025-02-01T02:01:12] 'lekrsu': And instead of a 50hz grid, you're doing 15000hz.
[2025-02-01T02:01:19] Jan: What?
[2025-02-01T02:01:26] 'lekrsu': On your scooter
[2025-02-01T02:01:32] Jan: Ah yes
[2025-02-01T02:01:46] 'lekrsu': Whatever your zero frequency is when divided by two.
[2025-02-01T02:02:33] Jan: But isnt that the on off switching frequency to try to get close to a sine wave form?
[2025-02-01T02:03:44] Jan: <photos/photo_21209@01-02-2025_02-03-44.jpg>
[2025-02-01T02:03:53] Jan: Something in that direction?
[2025-02-01T02:04:14] Jan: Makes sense
[2025-02-01T02:04:36] Jan: Else it would result in constant speed
[2025-02-01T02:04:58] Jan: Just torque more or less with amplitude
[2025-02-01T02:05:16] Jan: Diminishing returns though
[2025-02-01T02:05:57] Jan: The speedforkers
[2025-02-01T02:06:58] Jan: I wonder what i get out of that system in efficiency 16S6P M58T Spintend Alubox 100A Stock motor
[2025-02-01T02:06:58] 'lekrsu': Riding 4khz on Ninebot controllers is fun, it's very strange and sounds like a train.
[2025-02-01T02:07:07] Jan: 10Wh/km possible?
[2025-02-01T02:07:51] Jan: I have 23Wh/km on 25kmh 33x2 dual 65H
[2025-02-01T02:08:04] Jan: Its like idling a dodge viper
[2025-02-01T02:08:46] 'lekrsu': I have 30wh/km on 17x4 😭
[2025-02-01T02:09:02] 'lekrsu': no ;)
[2025-02-01T02:09:14] Patrick: What frequency you think is high enough for max efficiency?
[2025-02-01T02:09:27] Jan: I guess 30khz
[2025-02-01T02:09:33] Jan: On vesc settings
[2025-02-01T02:10:05] 'lekrsu': Your system will misbehave if set too high.
[2025-02-01T02:10:19] Patrick: Maybe possible, i had 11,8wh at my nami klima dual motor at rangetest 260km and 25kmh
[2025-02-01T02:11:26] Patrick: I also search the perfect setting, because i plan a 3000km trip and efficency are most important. Should be minimum 300km per day 😝
[2025-02-01T02:12:17] 'lekrsu': I run 33khz as even on 35, there's slight motor stutter on Mxlemming (without load), and as a bonus, outside of hearing range, ;)
[2025-02-01T02:13:52] Patrick: Have lonnyo 22x3 70H nami burn and two spintend 250A With my nami klima i had 45h stock motors, and now 60h 16x4, i will test it if weather in austria are better, and share results withyou 🙂
[2025-02-01T02:20:16] 'lekrsu': Allegedly better low rpm torque response on very low pwm.
[2025-02-01T02:20:24] Patrick: I drive 22s setup, i hope they will hold it. My klima also but with 150A spintend. No problems 😇
[2025-02-01T02:21:43] 'lekrsu': However the sounds and motor vibrations that causes isn't nice.
[2025-02-01T02:22:02] 'lekrsu': Leave the imperfections to overmodulation ;)
[2025-02-01T03:33:27] Finn: Best😁
[2025-02-01T03:53:03] haku: if torp is vesc. i know its a nono vesc. but can you run those in can dual motors?
[2025-02-01T04:46:25] haku: it sucks that they did that tbh.
[2025-02-01T04:46:52] haku: profit off benjamins work and not credit him
[2025-02-01T10:02:52] Eren: <video_file>
[2025-02-01T10:03:01] Eren: Typical xiaomi on the winter
[2025-02-01T10:03:08] Eren: Bought it 5months ago
[2025-02-01T10:09:23] GABE: Is it hacked?
[2025-02-01T10:09:56] GABE: Why is there smoke coming out of it? Those cells are by no means venting
[2025-02-01T10:10:15] GABE: So many questions so little backstory
[2025-02-01T10:10:35] Eren: No basically
[2025-02-01T10:10:49] Eren: I stoped using it for 5 months
[2025-02-01T10:10:59] Eren: Came back at it yesterday
[2025-02-01T10:11:05] Eren: Battery was at 0%
[2025-02-01T10:11:14] Eren: It started to act up
[2025-02-01T10:11:14] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Hghhgg has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-02-01T10:35:01] GABE: There is literally nothing in there to burn like that, other than the cells, yet they haven't exploded.
[2025-02-01T10:49:58] Eren: Idk man its weird cause its working now
[2025-02-01T10:52:51] GABE: No pal
[2025-02-01T12:07:23] Ev Pro World: Ill match any price
[2025-02-01T15:10:43] Noname: Plot twist he's poor and just window shopping
[2025-02-01T15:40:59] Noname: @Bradhaku when do you give up and buy a grom?
[2025-02-01T16:10:07] haku: idk when electric ban
[2025-02-01T16:26:52] haku: send me your 250 your not using
[2025-02-01T16:38:31] haku: i hate to brag but wepoor is faster than a stock grom.
[2025-02-01T17:00:23] Noname: Not faster than a Motorola
[2025-02-01T17:01:01] Noname: <animation>
[2025-02-01T17:01:35] Noname: Sure for the off season we split visitation rights

[2025-02-01T17:06:05] Franchesco Carofano: just one command
[2025-02-01T17:23:53] haku: what you too. what settings
[2025-02-01T17:25:14] haku: what battery and phase amps?
[2025-02-01T18:08:32] haku: can you open it please. i want to see which mosfets this has
[2025-02-01T18:09:58] GABE: open it.
[2025-02-01T18:27:16] Mirono escooters: I'm not sure I should say the obvious but Don't use a scoot that smoked?
[2025-02-01T18:27:21] Mirono escooters: Or it got a heater circuit lol
[2025-02-01T18:29:19] Mirono escooters: Outside
[2025-02-01T18:29:30] JPPL: Phase connections didn't touch eachother?
[2025-02-01T18:29:37] JPPL: Outside
[2025-02-01T18:41:45] haku: does it burn like that if it touches? or just short?
[2025-02-01T18:44:17] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Easy fix 2 items needed 🤣

[2025-02-01T19:56:18] JPPL: While riding if it touch yes
[2025-02-01T20:04:12] Patrick: Does someone know what happens there?
[2025-02-01T20:04:27] Patrick: Delta Pro2 motor, isnt even detected over the motor detection
[2025-02-01T20:05:34] Patrick: When doing Manuel detection it spins like this, but once trying to spin it over the keyboard it crashes like in the video above
[2025-02-01T20:06:33] Patrick: This is how its wired inside, i got told this is right
[2025-02-01T20:13:37] Yamal: Woyoyoyyyyyyyyyyy
[2025-02-01T20:14:01] Yamal: Beautiful scape today ,, just cutting the videos ….
[2025-02-01T21:11:59] Eren: Chinese bike small rev
[2025-02-01T21:12:44] Eren: The day before the battery fried
[2025-02-01T21:14:23] Eren: Small wheelie on a 300w motor
[2025-02-01T21:15:01] Eren: With that same scooter i go 2mins doing wheelie

[2025-02-01T21:22:38] Eren: Ever saw this irl or nah ?
[2025-02-01T21:22:51] haku: we have those where im from
[2025-02-01T21:23:05] Eren: Are u in L’as vegas ?
[2025-02-01T21:23:08] haku: yea
[2025-02-01T21:23:13] Eren: Knew it
[2025-02-01T21:23:23] Eren: I went there so nice
[2025-02-01T21:23:36] Eren: Espacially the toirist side

[2025-02-01T21:24:27] Eren: Ever went to Nyw ?
[2025-02-01T21:24:35] haku: exept sweden. we dont have those
[2025-02-01T21:24:53] haku: no farthest ive got is to texas
[2025-02-01T21:24:56] Eren: Yes
[2025-02-01T21:25:08] Eren: Thats still good tho
[2025-02-01T21:25:24] Eren: Is there alot of shooting there ?
[2025-02-01T21:25:30] Eren: No offense
[2025-02-01T21:25:50] haku: in other hoods yea
[2025-02-01T21:25:56] Eren: Oh ok
[2025-02-01T21:26:15] Eren: U probably next to casinos rn 😂
[2025-02-01T21:26:31] Eren: Living *
[2025-02-01T21:26:43] haku: nah. cant gamble if you have nothing to gamble with
[2025-02-01T21:26:51] Eren: Ye true
[2025-02-01T21:27:01] haku: i gamble with ali purchases
[2025-02-01T21:27:06] Eren: lol
[2025-02-01T21:42:20] haku: my new used jetson cover came in
[2025-02-01T22:18:26] GABE: Where the fuck did you get that frame from again?
[2025-02-01T22:19:25] GABE: Wrong channel for this you know this should go into the Scooter hacking or M365 channel right?
[2025-02-01T22:19:41] GABE: Nobody here does anything with non VESC tech
[2025-02-01T22:20:28] haku: i bet you guys cant do this eh?
[2025-02-01T22:32:54] haku: fellow sitdown rider. this one us wearing a mask for some reason.
[2025-02-01T22:46:29] haku: why em i getting asked the same questions over and over?

[2025-02-01T23:43:53] Matte: why is your thumb throttle so high? lower it for god sakes
[2025-02-01T23:51:18] Yamal: I want to put the sur ron accelerator on, I keep this one high because if it doesn't stop down on the brake lever... and that's the way to keep the brake lever a little low
[2025-02-01T23:55:51] haku: arent you from asturias?
[2025-02-01T23:56:12] haku: ive read about that place. the prince of spain

[2025-02-02T00:08:42] haku: never been. but ive read some history about it.

[2025-02-02T00:40:18] Smart Repair: How many amps can the 5v output of the x12 handle? Does anyone know?
[2025-02-02T00:43:04] Smart Repair: By the way, the ubox doesn't like salt water from the street 😬
[2025-02-02T00:57:08] haku: i will try to apply to the FBI
[2025-02-02T00:58:24] haku: Noname do you need law enorcement background for that job? like an investigator?
[2025-02-02T01:04:44] Eren: Ik i sent this 3 times but its a masterpiece lol its frying
[2025-02-02T01:32:35] Matthew: I have 22x3 and wish I would have gone 60h 17x4 instead of 65h 22x3. Once moving about 15mph and up single motor pushes well. But from 0 speed start the torque is definitely lackluster and should be used as dual motor though dual motor will be insane depending on the power you're throw at the motors. From what I've gathered 30mph cruise speed for 65h single motor runs great and acceleration is strong.. start going over 30mph the single motor for me starts getting hot. Input from someone the motor i should have bought is 60h 17x4 which was told 40mph doesn't get hot and with some fw ~50mph top speed capable.
[2025-02-02T01:34:58] Matthew: Where the Q axis under foc fw shows 2%. Is there anyway to change and make more power.. or just leave that alone?
[2025-02-02T01:36:11] Jan: You amps are lackluster, thats why its not going. Give it 200-300A phase, it will go
[2025-02-02T01:36:48] haku: dam my pregnant tire is on its 3rd term. i need to abort it.
[2025-02-02T01:36:49] Jan: I would buy a second 22x3, its the best setup
[2025-02-02T01:36:55] haku: this is bad
[2025-02-02T01:39:11] haku: how does that happen? shit tire?

[2025-02-02T01:52:50] haku: look at this wrap.
[2025-02-02T01:54:31] haku: thanks. give it more amps. thats how i felt with 70h 33x2 x2. too bad too much amps just keeps messing my vescs
[2025-02-02T02:11:12] Matte: ugly car ugly wrap damn
[2025-02-02T02:11:53] haku: walk of shame. what did i do lord.
[2025-02-02T02:12:35] haku: look like sunset color.
[2025-02-02T02:12:47] haku: it just needs some white 😜
[2025-02-02T02:17:45] Matte: looks like a used blue tampon
[2025-02-02T02:21:53] haku: tbh i do agree 100% i dont like that color way. it used to be cool
[2025-02-02T02:22:31] haku: colors in america have meanings behind it. so unfortunate. need something neutral
[2025-02-02T02:24:10] haku: why cant we go back to the good ol days when colors was for everyone. this is my childhood hero. https://youtube.com/shorts/T6WA0n_jk8o?si=shqa22L7OuBZXEy9
[2025-02-02T02:33:23] Rogerio Figueiredo: What is the price for that motor?
[2025-02-02T02:43:04] Rogerio Figueiredo: My teverun 7260r bright 33x2 motor is better for top speed right?
[2025-02-02T03:03:09] Matte: yes
[2025-02-02T03:39:12] haku: thank the for my hoarding skills. honestly my hoard is thinning down.
[2025-02-02T03:39:41] haku: the worse tire but it should do atleast 30mph
[2025-02-02T03:42:42] Rogerio Figueiredo: So why not use 33*2 instead of 23*3?
[2025-02-02T03:42:57] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is just a personal question because I don't know
[2025-02-02T04:30:41] haku: what top speed for teveruns?
[2025-02-02T06:02:31] Franchesco Carofano: Molicel battery 42ah 72 voll 10p 20s configure with 250 face 150 battery friend 350 obsolute
[2025-02-02T06:04:19] haku: oh thats strange. it should be able to take that
[2025-02-02T06:06:12] haku: i ran my first one for 250 battery and 300 phase no problems until burnout. the second set i had with the hy mosfets 200/300. that one failed
[2025-02-02T06:06:52] Franchesco Carofano: It came from the factory wrong, I couldn't get anything to run and on one side I smoked once and again the other one has the same configuration, it's the same on both controllers, the only fault is that one. I'm writing to the manufacturer to see if the warranty covers me.
[2025-02-02T06:07:13] haku: it should
[2025-02-02T06:07:50] haku: i think its time for a 18fet spintend
[2025-02-02T07:27:17] yoann tsobanoglou: Hello, been trying to play with vesc express and lisp code to build the spintend green board in small format. Have achieved brake lights and motor brake but getting small delay reaction from vesc. Anyone every tried to code with vesc express over can to trigger actions?
[2025-02-02T07:28:05] yoann tsobanoglou: <animation>
[2025-02-02T08:41:08] Yamal: 22/3 winding, it is nervous and fun (always dual), in single it is not ideal,, Conclusion from my experience with 200 A per motor there is a lot of torque """"" but a little without control, because if you are careless in deep accelerations the front wheel will slip in a dangerous way that on multiple occasions destabilizes the scooter
[2025-02-02T09:24:11] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Future project will be thunder dual 22/3

[2025-02-02T12:24:25] Rogerio Figueiredo: What controllers will u use?
[2025-02-02T12:27:52] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <photos/photo_21225@02-02-2025_12-27-52.jpg>
[2025-02-02T12:58:16] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 1 75200 pro V2 1 84100hp Have another 75200 pro V2 on the way but think post lost it
[2025-02-02T13:05:21] GABE: It's a clone, go check, just trash it.
[2025-02-02T13:47:01] Yamal: <photos/photo_21226@02-02-2025_13-47-01.jpg>
[2025-02-02T13:56:27] Rogerio Figueiredo: Why diferent controllers?
[2025-02-02T13:56:33] Rogerio Figueiredo: Why not spintend?
[2025-02-02T14:07:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Don't have 2 same currently
[2025-02-02T14:08:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Didn't have the money at the time but if I'll get the 75200 I wait for I'll sell both and buy spintend
[2025-02-02T14:19:40] GABE: Would a metal or sand Dremel bit be better for cutting off solder from cells?
[2025-02-02T14:20:04] GABE: To my memory the sand bits had a tough time. @jamessoderstrom @Mirono_escooters @punedir
[2025-02-02T14:20:39] GABE: <photos/photo_21227@02-02-2025_14-20-39.jpg>
[2025-02-02T14:35:51] GABE: Are those the metal or sand ones? I'm not kidding
[2025-02-02T14:36:37] Patrick: 65H 22x3 Lonnyo is ~315USD with shipping to germany
[2025-02-02T14:37:03] GABE: Yeah it had issues last time, it was catching in it and snapping. I'll grab the metal ones
[2025-02-02T14:37:03] Patrick: Motor itself is ~205USD
[2025-02-02T14:37:13] 'lekrsu': Are you now spotwelding all those soldered p42s?
[2025-02-02T14:37:35] GABE: Yeah soon. I was rushing. Now more work and more money to spend.
[2025-02-02T14:37:40] GABE: Smh
[2025-02-02T14:37:41] GABE: Lol
[2025-02-02T14:37:46] GABE: I'm Impulsive as hell
[2025-02-02T14:44:52] GABE: 230 euro for all shite
[2025-02-02T14:44:52] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-02-02T14:49:06] Matte: desolder with copper braid and then scrape the remainder
[2025-02-02T14:50:17] GABE: It's non leaded solder, so the heat required could kill the cells.
[2025-02-02T14:50:38] GABE: I've abused them alot.
[2025-02-02T14:50:41] Matte: yeah well heat couldve killed the cells when you soldered them first time anyways
[2025-02-02T14:50:58] GABE: I'm worried if I do it one more time they could be cooked.
[2025-02-02T14:51:34] GABE: I think I'll just Dremel it off
[2025-02-02T14:55:25] Matte: try carbide burr bits
[2025-02-02T14:56:46] Matte: <photos/photo_21229@02-02-2025_14-56-46.jpg>
[2025-02-02T15:03:05] Mirono escooters: Bruh, is it worth it
[2025-02-02T15:03:41] GABE: Yes
[2025-02-02T15:03:45] GABE: Sure.
[2025-02-02T15:03:57] Matte: No IMO, i would never trust a battery pack like that, but he dont seem like a common sense person anyways
[2025-02-02T15:04:25] GABE: Max draw 20a.
[2025-02-02T15:04:34] GABE: 10a a cell peak.
[2025-02-02T15:04:36] Matte: imagine having that battery pack in your house
[2025-02-02T15:06:15] GABE: I actually barely soldered on them, it wouldn't stick.
[2025-02-02T15:06:32] GABE: it's why I'm comfortable keeping them around.
[2025-02-02T15:06:39] GABE: It was low quality solder so I gave up.
[2025-02-02T15:06:46] Matte: nobody knows what youre talking about then, show us a photo
[2025-02-02T15:06:50] GABE: I know how much I microwaved them.
[2025-02-02T15:08:17] GABE: <photos/photo_21230@02-02-2025_15-08-17.jpg>
[2025-02-02T15:08:17] GABE: <photos/photo_21231@02-02-2025_15-08-17.jpg>
[2025-02-02T15:08:43] GABE: In my opinion very saveable.
[2025-02-02T15:09:34] Matte: yeah, for a small pack that is going to power your 100W headlight or something
[2025-02-02T15:09:34] GABE: The ones with the solder on the negative I'm a bit worried about, it's direct heat transfer. For the positive, it has less mass so the core doesn't get nearly as hot.
[2025-02-02T15:10:23] GABE: I'll see if I can source p42a
[2025-02-02T15:10:27] GABE: It's quite an old cell so hard to find
[2025-02-02T15:10:34] Matte: on the positive you can overheat the insulator between positive cap and negative can
[2025-02-02T15:12:52] Matte: get BAK 45D and make a new pack
[2025-02-02T15:13:16] GABE: Nkon has them yes?
[2025-02-02T15:15:18] 'lekrsu': Day 364 of waiting for Gabe to finish a project

[2025-02-02T16:09:55] Jan: Says even Lonnyo on the bottom right
[2025-02-02T16:12:51] Unknown: I need friends like this
[2025-02-02T16:16:34] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes but claims 90h at a radicalus price
[2025-02-02T16:17:06] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So maybe its 80/85h ?

[2025-02-02T16:21:17] Jan: i dont know
[2025-02-02T16:27:38] Yamal: Pretty nice the motor man
[2025-02-02T16:27:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's 700$
[2025-02-02T16:27:57] Yamal: But the ring ?
[2025-02-02T16:28:03] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Which is unrealistic price in here so hard to believe
[2025-02-02T16:28:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I don't know

[2025-02-02T16:47:51] Finn: Mini blade?
[2025-02-02T16:49:18] JPPL: It's not unrealistic I guess
[2025-02-02T16:49:38] JPPL: Completely new motors z new batch, minimum production because it will not sell a lot
[2025-02-02T16:49:54] JPPL: Will be around 700/800eur
[2025-02-02T16:49:57] Paolo ⁭: Yes but high torque winding
[2025-02-02T16:50:09] Paolo ⁭: If you turn delta will be same as the one u have
[2025-02-02T16:53:20] Patrick: My miniblade burned fast sadly 65km/h vmax i reached
[2025-02-02T16:53:34] Patrick: With a better esc that runs smooth maybe 70
[2025-02-02T16:57:41] GABE: 200 for 4? I'm confused
[2025-02-02T16:58:02] GABE: Are you finally pulling out of the business?
[2025-02-02T16:58:11] Paolo ⁭: Yes
[2025-02-02T17:02:15] Yamal: why don't you post it on the channel to sell things scooter parts vesc group?
[2025-02-02T17:05:28] Yamal: 1 day to complete a year! I still take a plane to Ireland and start looking for Gabe everywhere xD
[2025-02-02T17:11:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Not after shipping and Israeli tax and the risk that it'll get confiscated by customs
[2025-02-02T17:13:20] Finn: 10x6 or whats it called?
[2025-02-02T17:14:08] Paolo ⁭: Idk
[2025-02-02T17:17:27] Matte: ikr
[2025-02-02T17:18:14] Matte: Why did you delete your recommendation? Let it be seen we agree with eachother
[2025-02-02T17:18:36] Noname: It was posted already. Use carbide burrs
[2025-02-02T17:28:40] Finn: <photos/photo_21236@02-02-2025_17-28-40.jpg>

[2025-02-02T17:47:58] JPPL: Be prepare soon, everything will be taxed even hard
[2025-02-02T17:51:03] Finn: Sadly 1zunas😂
[2025-02-02T17:51:23] Finn: Mine looks better😁
[2025-02-02T18:03:55] haku: @SirModAlot use these.

[2025-02-02T18:04:04] haku: sand will just gunk up
[2025-02-02T18:05:39] haku: lord why did you do this? all your cells are like this?
[2025-02-02T18:07:04] GABE: Ew no just 10 of them haha
[2025-02-02T18:07:05] haku: the tarrifs are real boys. it will come. ive been preaching this since last year
[2025-02-02T18:07:11] GABE: you think I'd do this to my whole supply? Bruh
[2025-02-02T18:08:12] GABE: These look similar @Bradhaku
[2025-02-02T18:08:47] GABE: My engineer friend resolved the problem with the TVS diodes that blew in the welder. He said start with 6 volt ones first.
[2025-02-02T18:08:49] haku: yea its doea
[2025-02-02T18:09:50] haku: i see.
[2025-02-02T18:10:18] GABE: I'm getting 6, 6.5 and 7v ones.
[2025-02-02T18:10:23] GABE: See which work. this is technically off topic
[2025-02-02T18:11:08] haku: just get spare parts for glitter.
[2025-02-02T18:11:11] haku: way cheaper
[2025-02-02T18:11:23] GABE: This is an easy fix atp
[2025-02-02T18:24:15] haku: i hope it never comes tbh
[2025-02-02T18:50:49] Yamal: https://youtu.be/fNPpcjlt9-c?si=YjHVs-RpDcp-lxSP
[2025-02-02T19:10:55] haku: thats small
[2025-02-02T19:14:09] Yamal: Portable ?
[2025-02-02T19:15:18] GABE: Everything burned inside for sure
[2025-02-02T19:15:31] GABE: Motor could be fine with new phases
[2025-02-02T19:15:42] GABE: Frame also fine of course
[2025-02-02T19:16:20] GABE: Time for a new cell and VESC I guess
[2025-02-02T19:22:29] Yamal: I wanted to know your opinion and advice,, What do you think about putting 80h 33/2 engines in the Nami? As you can see, it is my vehicle for absolutely everything, until the family arrives, I will have to start using it. car and so on,,,, The truth is that I don't look for dirt routes with it, they simply present themselves without further ado,,, The issue is that on the one hand it makes me sad to put cream motors on this scooter, which doesn't stop,,, the other option is to leave it for the thunder project that really doesn't have a final date to be finished today.. .
[2025-02-02T19:36:20] haku: yes. tiny
[2025-02-02T19:37:10] haku: do it. you already have spare 22x3 incase. you need big dick vescs imo
[2025-02-02T19:37:33] haku: or your tune need to be 100% correct no mistakes
[2025-02-02T19:38:34] haku: god forbid fardriver demons whisper in our ears
[2025-02-02T19:43:22] Yamal: But if I mount 33/2 I sale my couple 22/3
[2025-02-02T19:44:26] Yamal: I don’t know … if I put on the Nami planing have 175A battery 300 A phase
[2025-02-02T19:44:56] Yamal: How do you think you'll walk like this?
[2025-02-02T19:45:33] Yamal: @jamessoderstrom you have the key
[2025-02-02T19:47:43] haku: he is the key
[2025-02-02T19:48:20] haku: last time i did not ask his council thats why kaboom
[2025-02-02T19:49:01] haku: i shouldve asked him to see what my settings was exaxtly
[2025-02-02T19:49:57] haku: why need 33x2 for daily driving. thats fast speeds
[2025-02-02T19:50:41] 'lekrsu': Inefficient for daily driving ;)
[2025-02-02T19:51:20] Yamal: ….😭
[2025-02-02T19:52:28] 'lekrsu': Unless your goal is constantly driving above 100km/h.
[2025-02-02T19:54:23] haku: yea its highway speeds needed for that motor
[2025-02-02T19:54:41] haku: need lots of amps just to accelerate
[2025-02-02T19:55:17] haku: if i had to redo my build i would go 22x3
[2025-02-02T19:55:25] Yamal: for the simple reason of being able to take my phase A to the "" limit of its possibilities, because 22/3 I have been using it for a few weeks in a row without traction control and although it is fun, sometimes the wheels spin without sense to make you lie down on the ground. ground with the scooter and to have stratospheric top speeds without having to hit the accelerator,,,
[2025-02-02T19:56:24] haku: remember you have to consider your vesc too.
[2025-02-02T19:58:11] Yamal: I think that ubox 85/250 will have no problems handling a 33/2 engine. There are scooters that achieved success like the JERV one, for example.
[2025-02-02T19:59:41] Yamal: Or look at Rapahel's ubox, they work like katanas in the French championship, okay, they are modified but the base is spintend
[2025-02-02T20:00:07] haku: true
[2025-02-02T20:00:37] Yamal: We see when they arrive…
[2025-02-02T20:01:58] 'lekrsu': Yeah but will you drive highway speeds?
[2025-02-02T20:02:25] 'lekrsu': Higher phase for the same torque without using the top speed, is quite useless.
[2025-02-02T20:02:55] Yamal: the new project at least and counting that it uses 80 h. I would have left battery/controllers/power adapter(handlebar)and brakes,,,
[2025-02-02T20:05:30] Yamal: When you have more power and top speed you end up using them but you are right,,,in the mornings to go to work I could only reach 120kmh xD
[2025-02-02T20:06:22] haku: oh if thats your riding style then 33x2 is for you
[2025-02-02T20:06:25] 'lekrsu': Using them?
[2025-02-02T20:07:43] Yamal: In short, all this is born from the idea of competition but the project/engines and other components are trapping the money, and the truth is that the circuit close to home is not worth €80 per month, compared to the prices out there. outside,, but I already told you I need to buy food,, there is no more
[2025-02-02T20:10:01] haku: yes if your competing for wold titles and standing ovations 33x2 with big amps
[2025-02-02T20:10:09] Yamal: I mean that if you have more top speed, in the end you end up running more... I have legal routes that are the ones that appear in the video but I also have straight routes of 25/35 km in which there are no barriers and of course They are not documented
[2025-02-02T20:10:29] 'lekrsu': You'll need higher wattage, that's it.
[2025-02-02T20:11:46] 'lekrsu': Phase amps is your motor amps, battery amps is self explanatory. Your battery amps * battery voltage = motor amps * motor voltage. Full speed, full motor voltage, means battery voltage = motor voltage, and phase current equals battery current.
[2025-02-02T20:12:13] GABE: You can get seperate stators btw
[2025-02-02T20:12:26] GABE: From Ly anyways
[2025-02-02T20:12:33] haku: i have learned alot using both jetson and wepoor. bikelane will get you there faster imo. wepoor i need to ride like a moto
[2025-02-02T20:12:45] haku: in the city atleast
[2025-02-02T20:12:48] 'lekrsu': 65H magnets scare me, 30H is already finger breaker
[2025-02-02T20:12:50] GABE: You could go on the bike lane.
[2025-02-02T20:12:53] GABE: I KNOW
[2025-02-02T20:13:05] GABE: I couldn't even take the 70h out dude
[2025-02-02T20:13:27] haku: true but i cant go highway speeds on the bikelane. i have to limit to 30mph.
[2025-02-02T20:13:44] GABE: You have 12p in that right?
[2025-02-02T20:13:46] Dualtron Achilleus: Already on rage mechics web site
[2025-02-02T20:13:56] GABE: That's enough wh that'll feed the 33x2 power wasters
[2025-02-02T20:14:05] GABE: With 6p you'd have Hella issues
[2025-02-02T20:14:10] haku: yea wepoor is 12p
[2025-02-02T20:14:12] GABE: What's the range on your ting?
[2025-02-02T20:14:21] GABE: Yeah no wonder the 33x2 is fine.
[2025-02-02T20:14:25] GABE: You're good just keep em bro
[2025-02-02T20:14:43] GABE: Big pack enables u
[2025-02-02T20:15:23] haku: very far. if i ride on street speeds 35-50mph. it starts draining on highway speeds. 65-80mph mph
[2025-02-02T20:16:04] GABE: Nah like what's the mileage on a full tank
[2025-02-02T20:16:32] GABE: U said mph
[2025-02-02T20:16:37] GABE: I mean miles here
[2025-02-02T20:16:41] haku: the limiting factor is the vesc now imo. i need bigger power i think or finely tuned vesc
[2025-02-02T20:17:01] GABE: Oh you mean street speeds u get 35-50 miles
[2025-02-02T20:17:11] haku: miles per hour
[2025-02-02T20:17:21] GABE: But what's the range on a full tank
[2025-02-02T20:17:23] haku: yea i get about 50 miles
[2025-02-02T20:17:30] GABE: That's great.
[2025-02-02T20:17:43] haku: maybe more if i ride bike lanes

[2025-02-02T20:18:21] haku: thats still with heavy tire screeching acceleration. i ride like an asshole
[2025-02-02T20:19:04] GABE: You have 22x3 ye
[2025-02-02T20:19:11] Yamal: Yes..
[2025-02-02T20:19:24] GABE: Makes sense why you get more range than him with less P
[2025-02-02T20:19:24] Yamal: Tiny wires :(
[2025-02-02T20:19:39] GABE: Change

[2025-02-02T20:22:05] haku: in the city atleast. sidewalk and bikelanes
[2025-02-02T20:22:08] Yamal: 80h on the way, my wife is definitely killing me. I hope I survive this month.

[2025-02-02T20:23:14] haku: thats how i got divorced. telling her
[2025-02-02T20:23:35] Yamal: I joke there is a good understanding, but it is better that I do not know until the summer

[2025-02-02T22:29:11] haku: but im.not sure about warranty. when i buy these things i dont consider those anyways
[2025-02-02T22:29:18] Yamal: There are people who travel with 12 feet with 35kw xD
[2025-02-02T22:29:51] haku: next one i get ill get james to help me fine tune it
[2025-02-02T22:30:02] Yamal: 35kw 160kmh okeee right
[2025-02-02T22:30:41] haku: but highway illegal. i need to do it in mexico. alright?
[2025-02-02T22:31:11] Yamal: My configuration is made by him after riding the scooter for a kilometer with the engines in the opposite direction and breaking the accelerator...
[2025-02-02T22:31:17] Yamal: xD
[2025-02-02T22:31:49] haku: i just put whatever my heart felt like. i need science not feelings
[2025-02-02T22:32:30] haku: hy powerstage didnt even made it 1 week. so unfortunate
[2025-02-02T22:33:29] haku: atleast i have a bunch of spare parts. i will fix in the future
[2025-02-02T22:51:45] Yamal: two and a half months exactly with spintend
[2025-02-02T22:52:44] haku: yes. spintend is great. peak g30 and jetson runs 6fet. never had any issues
[2025-02-02T22:53:03] haku: its the wepoor 33x2 need too much current
[2025-02-02T22:53:09] haku: and too heavy
[2025-02-02T22:54:30] Yamal: <photos/photo_21247@02-02-2025_22-54-30.jpg>
[2025-02-02T22:54:57] haku: i didnt even notice it has an odometer
[2025-02-02T22:55:20] Yamal: It’s 200A to much ?
[2025-02-02T22:55:32] haku: no idea tbh
[2025-02-02T22:55:51] haku: i ran 250/300 before no issues but heat
[2025-02-02T22:55:56] haku: bad mounting

[2025-02-02T22:57:34] JPPL: https://www.ennoid.me/esc/mk8-pro-esc
[2025-02-02T23:01:56] haku: thats new
[2025-02-02T23:12:35] Noname: Fixing my truck and this lil clip went flying fml
[2025-02-02T23:15:48] JPPL: Recent
[2025-02-02T23:57:19] GABE: that seems about right
[2025-02-02T23:58:22] GABE: no need to worry about it
[2025-02-03T00:14:05] haku: yea. but if you want tire screeching its necessart
[2025-02-03T00:41:33] GABE: it doesnt do enough? from the video you showed it was peak
[2025-02-03T00:42:21] haku: yea. you mean you really have to push vesc with alot of current to get the best out of it
[2025-02-03T00:42:54] GABE: ah vescs get hot
[2025-02-03T00:43:01] GABE: u mean
[2025-02-03T00:43:29] GABE: Is it working now?
[2025-02-03T00:43:30] haku: yea. also i like to ride like an asshole. burnouts all the time. make all the noise baby
[2025-02-03T00:43:52] haku: no need a new powerstage or replace mosfets
[2025-02-03T00:44:07] GABE: This happened cos of the BMS right
[2025-02-03T00:44:08] GABE: yikes
[2025-02-03T00:44:17] GABE: BMS and ebrake
[2025-02-03T00:44:20] GABE: forgot exactly why
[2025-02-03T00:44:20] haku: i think. im not sure tbh
[2025-02-03T00:44:28] GABE: it had to be
[2025-02-03T00:44:43] haku: maybe yea.
[2025-02-03T00:44:45] GABE: someone explained it in here
[2025-02-03T00:45:01] GABE: Regen is awesome, just don't let the bms turn charging off.
[2025-02-03T00:45:12] haku: the old powerstage did not have any problems. exept when i lock wheels for burnouts
[2025-02-03T00:45:53] GABE: what should i set it next time
[2025-02-03T00:45:53] GABE: So high that it never engages.
[2025-02-03T00:46:21] haku: i have to turn one motor off. the 2nd time it happened both vesc died i wasnt doing a burnout. just pinned throttle
[2025-02-03T00:46:47] GABE: don't forget to set it so the BMS won't turn off anyways
[2025-02-03T00:47:07] GABE: yes. two at once. definitely BMS brother
[2025-02-03T00:47:31] GABE: unless someone EMPed your vehicle we know what's up
[2025-02-03T00:52:48] Noname: Gonna check in a min but I think my bms is 40a charging and 90a brakes on my vsett 👀
[2025-02-03T00:53:44] Noname: Although overcharge time delay would help
[2025-02-03T00:55:11] haku: this might be the last photo of these badboys together.
[2025-02-03T00:55:56] haku: maybe it was right on my street. i wanted to make a statement to my onewheel riding neighbor
[2025-02-03T00:56:30] haku: makes me think now. it might be him or the dog
[2025-02-03T00:56:35] Noname: Yeah 50a and 30 sec might have saved my ass
[2025-02-03T00:57:16] haku: ebrake is amazing regen i dont really care for.
[2025-02-03T00:57:21] Jason: gotta ergo mech everywhere 😄
[2025-02-03T01:43:34] haku: gadam asians and thier private racetrack.

[2025-02-03T01:45:47] Noname: Hide in bushes toss a stick in the front rim, they fly over the bars. Swoop in and put them in a arm bar
[2025-02-03T01:46:32] haku: should i call ICE on these people? or they are okay in america?
[2025-02-03T01:46:43] Noname: Damn son look up a burromax show me what's avail

[2025-02-03T01:47:54] Noname: If so sorry you look like the criminal we were tipped off about, go on about your day. Take no responsibility for your actions
[2025-02-03T01:48:32] haku: these people keep property value high though. good to have em
[2025-02-03T01:49:09] Noname: Ok look up burromax I don't want to chance my search location
[2025-02-03T01:50:19] Noname: Busy looking up trans/midget/...well "movies"

[2025-02-03T02:29:03] Matte: id take it for 200 just for parts
[2025-02-03T02:30:18] haku: i actually have a frame that can fit his parts. maybe i can profit of it
[2025-02-03T02:36:43] haku: Noname i knew youd do it. good stuff man.
[2025-02-03T02:37:49] haku: just credit me please because this was my idea.

[2025-02-03T15:59:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's too expensive price to performance also big
[2025-02-03T16:01:51] Yamal: I start with Kelly in Nami
[2025-02-03T16:03:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is Kelly any good?
[2025-02-03T16:12:54] Yamal: Better Vesc man

[2025-02-03T16:15:55] Yamal: <video_file>
[2025-02-03T16:15:55] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-02-03T16:17:16] Jason: my controller xd

[2025-02-03T16:28:46] Hurriicane: Hello, I have 75100 v2. It does not turn on. When I give 3.3 from outside, the blue light is on and then the red light flashes. I can connect to the vesc tool but when I insert the battery, it does not turn on.

[2025-02-03T16:30:56] 'lekrsu': Keep it to one topic chat.
[2025-02-03T16:31:58] Dualtron Achilleus: What build
[2025-02-03T16:32:21] Dualtron Achilleus: Every vesc have this right?
[2025-02-03T16:32:39] Hurriicane: Should I post it to a topic?
[2025-02-03T16:32:59] Hurriicane: Jump to topic channel?
[2025-02-03T16:33:44] 'lekrsu': You posted in in vesc help, no need to cross post. Everyone will see it twice.
[2025-02-03T16:34:11] Hurriicane: Sorry, I didn't realize I put it there.
[2025-02-03T16:34:20] Hurriicane: 🙏

[2025-02-03T16:36:46] Dualtron Achilleus: I mean scooter frame and motor
[2025-02-03T16:37:14] 'lekrsu': What happened here?
[2025-02-03T16:38:02] Jason: not yet
[2025-02-03T16:38:15] Jason: typical flipsky moment?
[2025-02-03T16:39:10] Dualtron Achilleus: Custom made controlor?
[2025-02-03T16:40:20] Jason: yep
[2025-02-03T16:41:33] Hackintoshhhh: WHAT DAFUQ
[2025-02-03T16:41:34] haku: havent you already showed us the finished powerstage? can you show
[2025-02-03T16:41:44] Hackintoshhhh: How does it 🔥 so badly
[2025-02-03T16:42:12] Dualtron Achilleus: You are some serious knowledge
[2025-02-03T16:42:54] haku: thanks
[2025-02-03T16:43:22] Rose: Hey there interess, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-02-03T16:43:37] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: when it works lol
[2025-02-03T16:44:45] Jason: it's different
[2025-02-03T16:45:05] Jason: now with more capacitance
[2025-02-03T16:45:13] Jason: and better arrangement i think
[2025-02-03T16:45:13] haku: you showed an aluminum board before
[2025-02-03T16:45:19] haku: gotcha
[2025-02-03T16:45:19] Jason: yeah
[2025-02-03T16:45:28] Jason: this is newer alu board design
[2025-02-03T16:45:36] haku: nice!
[2025-02-03T16:46:02] haku: keep it up dude. only folks like you can improve these vescs
[2025-02-03T16:46:20] haku: likeminded folks
[2025-02-03T16:46:27] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-02-03T16:46:50] haku: can you try a fardriver powerstage compatible witg vesc?
[2025-02-03T16:47:00] haku: would that be possible?
[2025-02-03T16:47:11] Jason: it's 2 shunt
[2025-02-03T16:47:19] Jason: possible but uhh
[2025-02-03T16:47:22] Jason: not rly gokd
[2025-02-03T16:47:38] haku: oh ok
[2025-02-03T16:48:52] Hurriicane: <photos/photo_21264@03-02-2025_16-48-52.jpg>
[2025-02-03T16:48:55] haku: the thing about fd boards is they have so many attatchments that are cheap. watercooling blocks etc.
[2025-02-03T16:49:00] Hurriicane: The marked parts have changed
[2025-02-03T16:49:35] Hurriicane: The road exploded from below
[2025-02-03T16:49:59] haku: if someone can make a vesc logicboard to bolt on to these. it will sell. im not sure if vedder will approve though
[2025-02-03T16:50:08] Hurriicane: I spotted it from above and pulled the road
[2025-02-03T16:50:23] Hurriicane: But ESC does not open, I bought it broken
[2025-02-03T16:50:38] Jason: it's open source
[2025-02-03T16:52:38] haku: is it? so many mosfets. the 350 is 24fet i believe
[2025-02-03T16:55:22] Matte: Yeah but when fardriver says 300A battery current it's more like 500A peak
[2025-02-03T16:56:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes but is 75200 pro V2 is better?
[2025-02-03T16:58:18] Jason: no
[2025-02-03T16:58:33] Jason: prob bit better than original 75100
[2025-02-03T16:58:35] Jason: but still
[2025-02-03T17:00:53] haku: lies demon. i will not listen
[2025-02-03T17:01:28] Matte: Vesc is cool for its own reasons but it isn't an answer to everything
[2025-02-03T17:02:01] haku: vesc is end all be all. just need bigger versions for non scooters that are affordable
[2025-02-03T17:02:47] Matte: Why do all of them burn out after bms cutoff?
[2025-02-03T17:03:21] haku: is it? no idea tbh.
[2025-02-03T17:27:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is spintend cheap ? Because a lot die lately
[2025-02-03T17:51:06] 'lekrsu': Haven't seen lots of cases of that happening unless when they're pushed beyond sane usage cases. Such as force stopping a motor with hundreds of amps, accidental shorting, or so.
[2025-02-03T18:00:52] Yamal: What if you don't have download bms? as is my case
[2025-02-03T18:02:58] Yamal: free discharge cowboy 😥
[2025-02-03T18:03:54] Noname: Dumb bms?
[2025-02-03T18:04:20] Noname: Funny Vsett dumps regen into the controller till it overheats then shuts it off completley
[2025-02-03T18:05:41] Yamal: 40A charge only bms (ant)
[2025-02-03T18:07:16] Yamal: I have never used electric or regenerative brakes, it is not my style, I prefer to use brake pads and discs xD
[2025-02-03T18:08:12] Noname: Missing out then.
[2025-02-03T18:09:18] Yamal: I already tell you
[2025-02-03T18:09:41] Yamal: I buy brake pads by weight""
[2025-02-03T18:10:22] Noname: Only problem is you need to use pads or they get dirty and don't work well. I almost crashed
[2025-02-03T18:14:02] Yamal: we miss your routes in the kawa….
[2025-02-03T18:14:52] haku: he bypass king
[2025-02-03T18:15:34] haku: big balls @jamaludin_algarnati
[2025-02-03T18:15:38] Noname: So what's the concern then. Hard to have bms cut if it's on vacation
[2025-02-03T18:16:13] haku: thats right no cutoff if bypass. i didnt think about that
[2025-02-03T18:16:14] Noname: If you set Max battery amps on vesc it's not the worst idea
[2025-02-03T18:17:10] haku: my cutoff at 510 but battery can do more. i really want to use the whole power
[2025-02-03T18:17:29] 'lekrsu': Fixed your woke settings yet?
[2025-02-03T18:17:46] haku: no. still need to order powerstage
[2025-02-03T18:17:59] 'lekrsu': Can still improve the bms side until
[2025-02-03T18:18:27] haku: ill just set charge cutoff to 1k amps
[2025-02-03T18:18:34] Noname: You want 3rd failure?
[2025-02-03T18:19:00] 'lekrsu': Yes, and increase lvl2 discharge a lot, and short protec a lot higher than 510.
[2025-02-03T18:19:00] haku: ofcourse not. but there are ways
[2025-02-03T18:19:32] 'lekrsu': Reason to use a clone wago on powerstage, 💀
[2025-02-03T18:20:34] Noname: That'll melt in power stage not regen lol
[2025-02-03T18:20:57] 'lekrsu': Regen rarely causes failure. Uncaptured regen does, ;)
[2025-02-03T18:21:23] Noname: Use ninebot stock connector 😆
[2025-02-03T18:21:35] 'lekrsu': Those melt the 16 awg phases 😭
[2025-02-03T18:21:39] haku: spintemd 18fet when?
[2025-02-03T18:21:51] haku: amy told me they working on it.
[2025-02-03T18:21:56] Noname: Just get the brick controller
[2025-02-03T18:22:22] haku: nd72350? 450?
[2025-02-03T18:22:44] Noname: Idk about fartdriver
[2025-02-03T18:23:07] haku: no dude. the harness and parameters on that is mindboggling
[2025-02-03T18:23:57] Noname: Then shut up 😆
[2025-02-03T18:23:57] haku: they go by rpms to calculate speed. wtf
[2025-02-03T18:24:36] haku: what brick controller you saying then?
[2025-02-03T18:24:41] 'lekrsu': Woke Trump stole 400€ from me
[2025-02-03T18:24:52] Noname: Fartdriver
[2025-02-03T18:24:59] 'lekrsu': Tariffs nonsense
[2025-02-03T18:25:00] Noname: Pony up and get a 7
[2025-02-03T18:25:41] haku: sponsor me
[2025-02-03T18:25:47] haku: ill show you nudes
[2025-02-03T18:25:56] Noname: For drugs and alcohol rehab sure
[2025-02-03T18:26:05] Noname: Or chocolate addiction
[2025-02-03T18:26:09] Noname: Never money
[2025-02-03T18:26:14] Noname: I'm horrible at that
[2025-02-03T18:26:53] haku: right now im in a pickle. no working pev
[2025-02-03T18:26:58] Noname: That motorcycle got sold I'm irritated
[2025-02-03T18:27:00] haku: exept sons bike
[2025-02-03T18:27:17] Noname: <animation>
[2025-02-03T18:27:19] 'lekrsu': Revive esx, did the motor ever work?
[2025-02-03T18:27:35] haku: i forgot about that tbh
[2025-02-03T18:27:43] haku: good idea
[2025-02-03T18:27:59] Noname: Stand like a peasant once again
[2025-02-03T18:28:52] haku: im gonna find that guy with the snsc again and offer more this time
[2025-02-03T18:29:19] 'lekrsu': Does your G30 frame have handlebars and all that too?
[2025-02-03T18:29:36] haku: no stem and bars. just bare frame
[2025-02-03T18:30:39] haku: peak g30v2 mini bmx is what i really look forward to. just needs welding
[2025-02-03T18:31:11] Noname: Your fine without brakes for now
[2025-02-03T18:31:34] haku: no way. at 30+mph
[2025-02-03T18:31:41] Noname: Regen stops you until like 2mph anyway. Just jam your foot on rear tire like children do
[2025-02-03T18:31:51] haku: ebrake only is sketch
[2025-02-03T18:31:57] Noname: Why vsett does 50 and I use them
[2025-02-03T18:32:13] haku: regen only?
[2025-02-03T18:32:20] Noname: Yeah
[2025-02-03T18:32:34] haku: you trying to kill me you fed
[2025-02-03T18:32:36] Noname: 90a is brutal decel
[2025-02-03T18:33:12] haku: vsett has 12fet yea? ill be using dual 100 v2
[2025-02-03T18:33:16] Noname: Yeah. Vegas small I find your house take hoard sell and become rich
[2025-02-03T18:34:11] haku: you can try. my killer watchdog doesnt get you good luck
[2025-02-03T18:36:15] Noname: Treats and a good belly rub I will dismantle his killer instinct easily
[2025-02-03T18:36:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I don't have a working one for 2-3 months now I'm losing my mind for real
[2025-02-03T18:36:51] haku: hes trans remember. you have to do more than that. 😜
[2025-02-03T18:37:23] haku: what happened to yours
[2025-02-03T18:37:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Hopefully I'll start on the new build before I do something unrevesable
[2025-02-03T18:38:10] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Sold it's battery to afford battery for the thunder 2. waiting for battery to be made and one vesc to arrive
[2025-02-03T18:42:15] Hurriicane: Helpppppp please
[2025-02-03T18:42:45] haku: what papi. im here. what happened
[2025-02-03T18:44:16] Yamal: I only have a small ant bms to charge the scooter(40A), direct and free download
[2025-02-03T18:44:33] Hurriicane: Read General discussions
[2025-02-03T18:44:42] haku: unlimited power eh?
[2025-02-03T18:46:09] Yamal: I entered this world through the door of Rion, and Rion does not have discharge BMS, therefore it was not included in the construction of my battery, only to charge and balance the cells.
[2025-02-03T18:46:18] Yamal: ^^'
[2025-02-03T18:46:20] Hurriicane: Is there Fuse on Vesc?
[2025-02-03T18:46:43] Yamal: I think no fuse
[2025-02-03T18:46:48] haku: no
[2025-02-03T18:46:55] Yamal: Really don’t know ..
[2025-02-03T18:46:56] Hurriicane: Okay
[2025-02-03T18:47:03] Hurriicane: My vesc is not working
[2025-02-03T18:47:10] Hurriicane: What should I do
[2025-02-03T18:47:59] Hurriicane: Alupcb
[2025-02-03T18:48:26] Hurriicane: 75100v2

[2025-02-03T18:52:06] Hurriicane: Could Voltage Regulators Be Problematic?
[2025-02-03T18:52:13] haku: maybe laughing not sure
[2025-02-03T18:52:28] Hurriicane: When I give 40v it does not open normally
[2025-02-03T18:52:43] Hurriicane: It doesn't turn on when I give it 5v.
[2025-02-03T18:52:48] Hurriicane: It opens when you give it 3.3
[2025-02-03T18:52:49] haku: show the whole photo more badass
[2025-02-03T18:53:07] Hurriicane: It does not turn on when you connect the battery normally.
[2025-02-03T18:53:12] Yamal: I don’t know man the stiker catch like this ..
[2025-02-03T18:53:35] haku: what voltage your battery
[2025-02-03T18:53:42] Hurriicane: 36
[2025-02-03T18:53:54] haku: law abiding
[2025-02-03T18:54:06] Hurriicane: <photos/photo_21265@03-02-2025_18-54-06.jpg>
[2025-02-03T18:54:15] Hurriicane: When you give it 3.3 it's like this
[2025-02-03T18:54:40] Hurriicane: It works when you connect it to the PC via serial. I installed the software from the PC.
[2025-02-03T18:55:03] haku: all firmware updated? voltage dialed in? im no expert but those are basic stuff
[2025-02-03T18:55:22] Hurriicane: Doesn't open
[2025-02-03T18:55:32] haku: oh
[2025-02-03T18:55:52] Hurriicane: You can open it when you give 3.3 from outside
[2025-02-03T18:55:58] Hurriicane: Doesn't turn on when battery is connected
[2025-02-03T18:56:07] Hurriicane: There is a fault
[2025-02-03T18:56:20] haku: what does the fault say
[2025-02-03T18:56:32] Hurriicane: It won't open 😂

[2025-02-03T18:57:20] Hurriicane: Battery Not Connected
[2025-02-03T18:57:27] Hurriicane: There is a problem with the upper card
[2025-02-03T18:57:27] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Hurriicane has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-02-03T18:57:40] haku: it says fault code undervoltage
[2025-02-03T18:58:16] haku: i cant answer you bro. im a noob too
[2025-02-03T18:59:42] Hurriicane: Where is 12v?
[2025-02-03T18:59:58] Hurriicane: When I connect the battery there is no response and it does not turn on.
[2025-02-03T19:00:23] Hurriicane: Power comes when 3.3v is supplied from outside.
[2025-02-03T19:01:06] Hurriicane: Okay
[2025-02-03T19:01:33] Hurriicane: What should I do
[2025-02-03T19:02:04] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-02-03T19:02:09] Hurriicane: I tried almost all of them
[2025-02-03T19:02:28] Hurriicane: No short circuit
[2025-02-03T19:02:33] Hurriicane: There is no 12v though
[2025-02-03T19:02:45] Hurriicane: None of them give an exit
[2025-02-03T19:02:57] Hurriicane: Even with battery installed
[2025-02-03T19:03:17] Hurriicane: I couldn't find
[2025-02-03T19:03:29] Hurriicane: Even if I measure without knowing, I can't understand
[2025-02-03T19:03:50] Hurriicane: Hmm
[2025-02-03T19:04:00] Hurriicane: So what do we do if there is no exit?
[2025-02-03T19:04:45] haku: next one will be single 17x4 just for this purpose
[2025-02-03T19:04:53] Hurriicane: Because there is no way out
[2025-02-03T19:05:22] Hurriicane: I don't understand, it's so ridiculous
[2025-02-03T19:05:33] Yamal: Nice man I cacht 2 nice photos

[2025-02-03T19:06:40] Hurriicane: They don't publish their schematics
[2025-02-03T19:06:55] Hurriicane: Or I couldn't find it
[2025-02-03T19:06:57] Yamal: 🔥
[2025-02-03T19:07:14] Hurriicane: Makerbase?
[2025-02-03T19:07:15] haku: legend has it he lived by the gun and died by the gun. we will be gunning our scooter bikes boys
[2025-02-03T19:08:34] Yamal: Anybody know why he die ,,
[2025-02-03T19:08:43] Yamal: Maybe his family ..
[2025-02-03T19:09:10] haku: i dont know. i like to think building the biggest vesc but the ko moto guys got him
[2025-02-03T19:09:19] Hurriicane: V1.0
[2025-02-03T19:09:28] Hurriicane: This is not it
[2025-02-03T19:09:36] Hurriicane: Doesn't it have to be V2?
[2025-02-03T19:10:01] 'lekrsu': Are there even differences
[2025-02-03T19:10:17] haku: they dont want his product out. they sent china assasins thru a boat landing in san diego to find him
[2025-02-03T19:10:33] Hurriicane: V2 non-combined 2 cards
[2025-02-03T19:12:27] haku: then he had to run on his surron thru the colorado mountains and had a shootout ontop the peak
[2025-02-03T19:12:31] puneDir: hello sit on a cactus it might fix your problem
[2025-02-03T19:12:37] Hurriicane: This looks different
[2025-02-03T19:13:42] 'lekrsu': Must be the SCT2A23ASTER
[2025-02-03T19:14:46] 'lekrsu': Yes, and EN pin;)
[2025-02-03T19:14:58] puneDir: <video_file>
[2025-02-03T19:14:59] 'lekrsu': Similar to Ninebot diagrams
[2025-02-03T19:15:07] Hurriicane: I can't see 12v
[2025-02-03T19:15:18] Yamal: You buy ?
[2025-02-03T19:15:24] 'lekrsu': After R8
[2025-02-03T19:16:22] Hurriicane: Thank you
[2025-02-03T19:18:04] haku: how many cc?
[2025-02-03T19:26:31] Noname: Dumb question is the battery output on? Smart bms?
[2025-02-03T19:27:33] Hurriicane: Battery output is open smrt BMS not Xiaomi battery

[2025-02-03T19:56:10] Hurriicane: @jamessoderstrom
[2025-02-03T19:56:27] Hurriicane: NO VOLTAGE TO VCC LEG
[2025-02-03T19:56:45] Hurriicane: The same driver next to it comes with 1.2v
[2025-02-03T19:57:03] Hurriicane: EG3112 model
[2025-02-03T19:57:44] Hurriicane: Yes
[2025-02-03T19:58:19] Hurriicane: EG3112 shows 12v in the schematic
[2025-02-03T19:58:35] Hurriicane: Which is 12v buck?
[2025-02-03T19:59:15] Hurriicane: The other one gets 1.2v
[2025-02-03T20:00:42] Hurriicane: 1.2 comes to two of them but not to one of them
[2025-02-03T20:00:58] Hurriicane: The writings have been erased and I can't read them on the card.
[2025-02-03T20:01:27] Hurriicane: <photos/photo_21270@03-02-2025_20-01-27.jpg>
[2025-02-03T20:01:42] Hurriicane: I guess it must be this
[2025-02-03T20:01:47] Hurriicane: Because at the entrance
[2025-02-03T20:02:01] Hurriicane: But 40v comes from one leg
[2025-02-03T20:02:05] Hurriicane: Is it normal?
[2025-02-03T20:02:05] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Hurriicane has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-02-03T20:05:59] Hurriicane: Very strange
[2025-02-03T20:06:29] Hurriicane: Two of the Eg3112s got 12v on the VCC pin.
[2025-02-03T20:07:00] Hurriicane: So what will happen to the remaining 1? 0v
[2025-02-03T20:07:19] Hurriicane: EG3112 IS A MOTOR DRIVER ?
[2025-02-03T20:07:56] Hurriicane: So, will the failure of the card affect the blue LED?
[2025-02-03T20:09:16] Hurriicane: Hmm
[2025-02-03T20:09:26] Hurriicane: 1 drive has no power
[2025-02-03T20:09:34] Hurriicane: I should look at 5v
[2025-02-03T20:09:45] Hurriicane: Or 3.3
[2025-02-03T20:10:00] Hurriicane: 2 pieces of 12 and 1 piece of 0
[2025-02-03T20:11:19] Hurriicane: <photos/photo_21271@03-02-2025_20-11-19.jpg>
[2025-02-03T20:11:28] Hurriicane: This may be faulty, I need to check it out
[2025-02-03T20:15:18] Hurriicane: No voltage
[2025-02-03T20:16:03] puneDir: 125
[2025-02-03T20:16:13] puneDir: my ass

[2025-02-03T20:20:46] puneDir: <photos/photo_21272@03-02-2025_20-20-46.jpg>

[2025-02-03T20:22:03] Hurriicane: In what
[2025-02-03T20:22:26] Hurriicane: I checked the outputs, 5v is coming out of the sockets but there is no 3.3v
[2025-02-03T20:23:13] Smart Repair: In short, what problem do you have?
[2025-02-03T20:23:35] Hurriicane: Esc is not working, light is not on
[2025-02-03T20:23:45] haku: this is what ill use for now. true peasant.
[2025-02-03T20:26:04] Smart Repair: Was there mechanical damage or why are the caps so crooked?
[2025-02-03T20:26:48] Hurriicane: Hardware
[2025-02-03T20:30:36] haku: like 50cent said would you love me in a bentley? would you love me in a bus? i asked 21 questions and its all about us
[2025-02-03T20:32:13] Noname: We don't love you on a kick scoot

[2025-02-03T20:36:51] haku: yea dam. so cheap there. i wonder why
[2025-02-03T20:38:02] Noname: Needs money kids in hospital. There's another for 2 and a set for 6 others are 200mi away
[2025-02-03T20:40:40] haku: same here. but they are pretty much giving it away there

[2025-02-03T21:00:07] JPPL: Nice mounting, allow to take out split rim for mount, but for full rim out must pass on cables
[2025-02-03T21:00:22] JPPL: I'm from Porto, better north

[2025-02-03T21:07:42] haku: they are both similar yea. one just needs more voltage and the other one more current
[2025-02-03T21:07:57] haku: both can perform similar
[2025-02-03T21:07:58] 'lekrsu': Both want high voltage, free speed free acceleration ;)
[2025-02-03T21:07:58] Yamal: Torque people call 22/3 now..
[2025-02-03T21:08:10] Yamal: But 22/3 it’s standard

[2025-02-04T00:45:57] Face de Pin Sucé: Why ?
[2025-02-04T00:48:30] haku: cybertruck is a strange vehicle. automatic haters once you get it haha
[2025-02-04T00:49:26] haku: it already has a reputation. the other teslas are okay now. its the cybertruck that gets all the heat
[2025-02-04T00:50:10] haku: so many of those here in vegas
[2025-02-04T00:52:13] Matte: yeah you cant really extinguish lithium battery fire
[2025-02-04T00:54:25] Matte: good, as it should be
[2025-02-04T00:57:04] Smart Repair: Correct, I have installed it too. However, in order to use the function you have to disconnect the CAN connection.
[2025-02-04T00:57:22] haku: once the price goes down. people will buy it watch boys.
[2025-02-04T00:57:51] Matte: thw world is full of idiots so i dont doubt that
[2025-02-04T00:59:36] Smart Repair: That would be an option. For that I would need a 2-channel RF module. Currently the second ESC is switched on via CAN.
[2025-02-04T01:00:17] haku: true. its inevitable
[2025-02-04T01:00:28] haku: you might be driving one someday
[2025-02-04T01:01:25] Matte: i dont think ill ever hate myself enough to do that
[2025-02-04T01:01:55] haku: it will get ya.
[2025-02-04T01:04:30] haku: elon will save us. maybe not all of us

[2025-02-04T01:12:00] haku: its not for rural riding
[2025-02-04T01:12:33] Noname: So mall crawler but electric even worse
[2025-02-04T01:13:35] haku: if you a country boy its not for you. if you dont comply with 2 genders its not for you. theres alot of regulations for electric cars
[2025-02-04T01:14:53] haku: if the cameras cant identify your gender its not for you
[2025-02-04T01:22:44] haku: pedal jetson and non pedal. tires alot bigger

[2025-02-04T03:01:05] haku: show us your battery builds. let me be the judge and jury of your work.
[2025-02-04T03:02:49] Matte: wanna see my terminal?
[2025-02-04T03:03:01] haku: show something you built
[2025-02-04T03:03:05] haku: anything
[2025-02-04T03:03:51] Matte: <photos/photo_21290@04-02-2025_03-03-51.jpg>
[2025-02-04T03:04:02] Matte: Imagine not isolating between parallels
[2025-02-04T03:05:05] haku: what did you use for isolation?
[2025-02-04T03:05:11] Matte: Far side terminal just for you haku
[2025-02-04T03:05:46] haku: thank you
[2025-02-04T03:05:54] Matte: kapton and vulcanized fibre ofcourse

[2025-02-04T04:44:09] Noname: It's a gay Inmotion in a gay cyber so - + - not gay
[2025-02-04T04:50:52] haku: that inmotion looks good if your not modding it. but you know how it goes
[2025-02-04T04:59:14] Noname: Idk just watching youtube
[2025-02-04T05:14:38] haku: its just the g30 platform has so many parts and mods available already.
[2025-02-04T05:15:00] haku: when laws come that will be the scooter to mod
[2025-02-04T05:16:37] haku: stock looking builds. but i really hope we dont come to that extreme laws
[2025-02-04T05:44:49] haku: is this your hoard? Noname https://youtube.com/shorts/V2zJK0w5T08?si=fwgwGcV20DxUqPeZ

[2025-02-04T07:29:50] Eren: Bro the scooter is cooked
[2025-02-04T07:30:16] Eren: Shits not even reconignizable
[2025-02-04T07:55:53] Hackintoshhhh: Is there an option to swap to gate driver with uvlo protection?
[2025-02-04T08:02:51] Hackintoshhhh: I’m nervous now

[2025-02-04T08:21:40] Jason: I also got cutoff at 60 ish km/h with 50a fwk + overmodulation
[2025-02-04T08:23:38] Yamal: you are in another league

[2025-02-04T08:27:10] Jason: mp2 da best😀
[2025-02-04T08:28:20] Yamal: you need a weped sonic frame to tickle your ESC
[2025-02-04T08:29:57] Yamal: That is why when at a red light next to a weped, when you accelerate, the weped has surely loosened some nut.
[2025-02-04T08:30:45] Yamal: But don't tell the owner of a $15,000 vehicle because they'll probably look at you the wrong way.
[2025-02-04T08:33:06] GABE: wow
[2025-02-04T08:33:13] Yamal: Now I also think you can fit 3Shull C1400 on weped sonic?
[2025-02-04T08:34:15] Yamal: Can you imagine his drawer full of 40pl?
[2025-02-04T08:37:09] Yamal: and of course Qs motor, but without a seat, a seat only for the American continent, or rather the Vegas
[2025-02-04T08:43:10] Jason: my next esc is more powerful
[2025-02-04T08:43:18] Jason: 18fet TO-220 to 18fet TOLL

[2025-02-04T08:47:00] Yamal: Or only g30 frame ,,?
[2025-02-04T09:25:40] Jason: g30.
[2025-02-04T09:25:50] Jason: maybe surron thingy or electric motorcycle
[2025-02-04T09:27:33] Yamal: Nice !
[2025-02-04T09:45:11] Hurriicane: Good Morning 😁

[2025-02-04T10:48:24] GABE: schem wise
[2025-02-04T10:48:39] GABE: think it was Jan who came up with 6p or idk who it was
[2025-02-04T11:12:38] Jan: Cant remember every detail. At the time 16-17S 5P was already done but it seemed we could fill out the whole frame and place controllers on the bottom. For sure the first 20S6P G30
[2025-02-04T11:13:13] Jan: The controllers were not available at the time, it took over a year into the project until we could get the first 85250 spintends
[2025-02-04T11:31:41] Tristan: Is there a telegram group about batteries?
[2025-02-04T11:33:47] Mirono escooters: Yes

[2025-02-04T12:29:42] Jan: There is a swiss guy who did a 20S5P all internal no spacer
[2025-02-04T12:33:06] Yamal: Y00000000!!!!!
[2025-02-04T12:33:20] GABE: What's this?

[2025-02-04T13:04:01] Smart Repair: with or without rails?
[2025-02-04T13:05:59] Yamal: I like your 70h motors xD
[2025-02-04T13:06:11] Yamal: +add the rim
[2025-02-04T13:10:13] Finn: Without rails would be possible. Curious where he put the controller.
[2025-02-04T13:14:34] 'lekrsu': May have been the first 21700, but likely the first 18650 20s6p was done very early on.
[2025-02-04T13:15:00] Jan: Side

[2025-02-05T22:48:14] Yamal: Because your are in France
[2025-02-05T22:48:18] Eren: 50€ worth it ?
[2025-02-05T22:48:21] Yamal: XD

[2025-02-05T22:49:38] Eren: There is alot for 50 100
[2025-02-05T22:49:42] haku: i would get one just to mess with
[2025-02-05T22:50:26] Eren: <photos/photo_21335@05-02-2025_22-50-26.jpg>
[2025-02-05T22:50:31] Eren: 400€ worth it ?
[2025-02-05T22:50:57] Yamal: 400?
[2025-02-05T22:51:01] haku: maybe
[2025-02-05T22:51:04] Eren: Dualtron victoryluxury
[2025-02-05T22:51:11] Yamal: Very good price
[2025-02-05T22:51:15] Yamal: Still working ?
[2025-02-05T22:51:18] Eren: Ooooh i like it

[2025-02-05T22:53:13] haku: sure
[2025-02-05T22:53:46] Eren: Im gonna buy it just for fun lol
[2025-02-05T22:54:09] haku: good deals always fun
[2025-02-05T22:54:48] Yamal: Teverun mini very nice too
[2025-02-05T22:55:27] Yamal: But Dt víctor better for me
[2025-02-05T22:55:50] Eren: I live in Paris thats probably why there is good deals
[2025-02-05T22:55:53] Eren: Idk
[2025-02-05T22:55:54] Yamal: + add thing
[2025-02-05T22:56:00] Eren: Ohhh yea
[2025-02-05T22:56:05] Yamal: Well, you would need a longer aluminum box to put the electronics inside, discharge battery, new LY motors with 10mm phases and vesc controllers
[2025-02-05T22:56:08] Yamal: XD
[2025-02-05T22:56:11] Eren: Lol
[2025-02-05T22:57:27] Yamal: You brake with shoes later if you want, but components are all the best,, titanium mast by ragemechanics
[2025-02-05T22:57:46] Eren: Ye trie
[2025-02-05T22:58:00] Eren: But still would not want it lol
[2025-02-05T22:58:30] Yamal: I am clear from now on I am going to recommend all the best xD
[2025-02-05T22:59:26] Yamal: It doesn't matter """"""""" chassis, but batteries, motors and controllers the best on the market
[2025-02-05T23:01:17] JPPL: No need the best to rock, is good to know
[2025-02-05T23:03:40] haku: what about the shittiest frame but stable. but sleeper top of the line components
[2025-02-05T23:04:07] haku: if you have to choose. looks or performance?
[2025-02-05T23:05:18] Yamal: I mean that many times it is worth it and it is cheaper to go to the "top" in components than to try 40,000 cheap motors and electronics or obtained in a tombola, because as the saying goes::::: "in the end, cheap is expensive."
[2025-02-05T23:08:03] haku: wtf is a tombola haha
[2025-02-05T23:08:15] haku: i like that word haha
[2025-02-05T23:08:37] Yamal: Example about I mean
[2025-02-05T23:08:46] Yamal: Tómbola later XD
[2025-02-05T23:09:06] Yamal: <photos/photo_21337@05-02-2025_23-09-06.jpg>
[2025-02-05T23:09:08] haku: ill use that word. is the phrase tombola parts sound correct?
[2025-02-05T23:09:44] haku: good charging port. get the one with the cover
[2025-02-05T23:11:21] Yamal: I recently fall my new phone from this support for the first time, I've had it for a long time, but anyway that's another story, whatever! If instead of carrying this support I carried a quad lock it would not have happened to me
[2025-02-05T23:11:39] Yamal: 😂
[2025-02-05T23:13:06] Yamal: Tombola
[2025-02-05T23:13:32] haku: yea that phone holder is sketch. it cant hold a big phone
[2025-02-05T23:14:37] Yamal: So phone support — Quad Lock——
[2025-02-05T23:14:47] haku: hahaha
[2025-02-05T23:15:05] haku: i see
[2025-02-05T23:15:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is it hackable?
[2025-02-05T23:15:21] haku: the prizes wow

[2025-02-05T23:17:10] Yamal: you buy a ticket and you can get anything
[2025-02-05T23:18:21] haku: gambling. i live in that city

[2025-02-05T23:19:59] haku: very cool. yea we have this but different
[2025-02-05T23:20:37] haku: this is called theme park microtransactions
[2025-02-05T23:26:50] Eren: Yes
[2025-02-06T01:21:26] haku: if theres no reward. im not looking for it.
[2025-02-06T01:57:57] haku: Noname triggering?
[2025-02-06T01:58:04] GABE: James working his magic here
[2025-02-06T01:59:23] haku: Noname they said scooters are gay. i got flabbergasted
[2025-02-06T02:00:31] Noname: Consider the source
[2025-02-06T02:02:13] haku: how should i reply to them?
[2025-02-06T02:02:49] Noname: Middle finger 🖕
[2025-02-06T02:05:26] haku: surron boys already have that cybertruck rep
[2025-02-06T02:43:56] GABE: This sleeper is insane
[2025-02-06T02:44:17] GABE: I went 70 there it feels like my very first scooter
[2025-02-06T02:51:51] haku: good work my boy
[2025-02-06T02:51:59] haku: now send over those 22x3s
[2025-02-06T02:52:20] haku: motor only no need for the rim
[2025-02-06T02:54:05] haku: next time i need his pro tuning. i cant just put random numbers anymore
[2025-02-06T03:14:08] Matthew: I have my spintend single ubox 85150 set at 280 amps absolute max, 210 amps phase and 90 battery. I am on 16s. I still don't really get anything different in power.
[2025-02-06T03:14:16] Matthew: <photos/photo_21341@06-02-2025_03-14-16.jpg>
[2025-02-06T03:20:14] Matthew: I love the idea... I can't imagine how that feels. You guys vaguely speaking have dealt with some crazy amazing power. Most I've dealt with to date is 2 vsett 10 motors and 2 single ubox 85150. Turned up to 160amps phase and full throttle definitely made me say JEEEEEBUUUZZZZ! I can't imagine how 2 65h 22x3 motors would feel like haha. But stuck with the dilemma of just getting a 60h 17x4 motor, stick with my single 65h 22x3, or buy another 85150 since my other one shorted out but the slave ubox was fine. But I just want a rwd ripper! 🤔🤪 I'd imagine no hill is too steep with dual 65h 22x3 haha
[2025-02-06T03:22:53] Matthew: How did you get 309 amps but "only" 8500 watts??
[2025-02-06T03:24:23] haku: im on the opposite. i want single motor 17x4 now.
[2025-02-06T03:25:24] haku: not fast speeds but enough for burnouts and bikelanes
[2025-02-06T03:27:31] Matthew: Yeah, my big magnet yume y11+ has tried to throw me on the ground on multiple occasions. And it succeeded 1 time while going ~30mph thus far. That's the main reason I don't care for dual motor on these scooters. Growing up with everything rwd... rwd is second nature to me and predictable
[2025-02-06T03:28:04] haku: it has some science to do with battery amps too i believe. you can only increase phase so much. im not to sure though
[2025-02-06T03:28:55] Matthew: I have my single ubox 85150 set 280 max, 210 phase and 90 battery. I still don't go over ~150 amps.
[2025-02-06T03:28:59] Matthew: <photos/photo_21341@06-02-2025_03-14-16.jpg>
[2025-02-06T03:29:29] Matthew: And this is me running late today. Good thing we have safety cuts. Surprised me actually
[2025-02-06T03:29:36] Matthew: <photos/photo_21343@06-02-2025_03-29-36.jpg>
[2025-02-06T03:29:57] haku: i see. im not pro but what james said. you might blow the vesc if you increase more
[2025-02-06T03:33:42] Matthew: What size rear tire are you using?
[2025-02-06T03:47:05] haku: smart bms always cuttoff if goes over yea
[2025-02-06T05:46:35] haku: Noname what you think of this .380. i likey https://youtube.com/shorts/Cc2tN1SxKv4?si=2EA6t1vxNpeOHXsD

[2025-02-06T06:58:25] Yamal: The dual motors 22/3 ---17/4 we agree that they are very playful/nervous and for day to day and routes they go well,,, in fact I have tested the 3 windings in the nami
[2025-02-06T07:07:58] Yamal: It would be nice to have 6 motors, a pair for each winding/same magnet length, 10mm phase and competition CNC rim. ! xd You can test each winding with the same battery/phase amps and same voltage.
[2025-02-06T07:08:29] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-02-06T07:09:48] Yamal: 75h 17/4 75h22/3 75h33/2

[2025-02-06T11:13:06] Jason: I wish shipping scooter to overseas was easy
[2025-02-06T11:15:39] haku: your such a voro fanboy

[2025-02-06T11:16:41] Yamal: Now I see why no brakes ?
[2025-02-06T11:19:32] Jason: ig front motor disconnected
[2025-02-06T11:19:47] Jason: oh it wasnt
[2025-02-06T11:21:16] Yamal: Nahhhhhh
[2025-02-06T11:21:55] Yamal: Vesc project vs Benjamin Vedder fanboy
[2025-02-06T11:23:11] Yamal: I just want them to start pronouncing and hearing the word VESC
[2025-02-06T11:23:55] Yamal: Voro for what ,,, what Voro do or make ? 🤣 Jogi Steve okeeee cool man xD
[2025-02-06T11:24:14] Jan: I have a VESC question. How many motors does it support at the same time. Can i do 4 motors with torque vectoring + a downforce fan?
[2025-02-06T11:25:21] Jan: So basically 5motor in one environment?
[2025-02-06T11:25:24] Jason: I wonder
[2025-02-06T11:25:30] Jason: i this it's possible
[2025-02-06T11:25:48] Jason: but a downforce fan, I think it should be separate
[2025-02-06T11:26:22] Jan: Propably
[2025-02-06T11:26:45] Jan: Would be nice to increase run time when its gforce dependant
[2025-02-06T11:27:13] Jason: maybe slap on accelerometer and use lisp
[2025-02-06T11:27:32] Yamal: but my respects to voro motor, they promote electric mobility, this is great
[2025-02-06T11:27:42] haku: theya are us retailer i think
[2025-02-06T11:27:52] Jan: But 4 is possible?
[2025-02-06T11:28:03] Jason: I think so
[2025-02-06T11:28:23] haku: for emove and inmotion
[2025-02-06T11:28:28] Jason: can assign multiple can id soooo
[2025-02-06T11:29:54] 'lekrsu': VESC by default in CAN allows up to four VESCs, one parent and three children, however there doesn't seem to be an actual limit, and you can expand beyond the four. But do you mean four motors on one single VESC?
[2025-02-06T11:31:12] Jan: 4 controllers over can bus with one input throttle
[2025-02-06T11:31:20] Jan: Would be s setup for a kart
[2025-02-06T11:32:45] Jan: 30S18P 40PL kart with active downforce fan for time attack
[2025-02-06T11:33:07] Jan: 136kW
[2025-02-06T11:33:39] Jan: Maybe 20kW for the fan, rest is 25kW per wheel
[2025-02-06T11:34:13] Jan: Something in the direction of formula sae
[2025-02-06T11:34:17] Jan: <photos/photo_21353@06-02-2025_11-34-17.jpg>
[2025-02-06T11:35:40] Jan: Battery pack is 50kg
[2025-02-06T11:36:02] Jan: I think maybe close to 1:1 hp/kg ration feasable
[2025-02-06T11:36:12] Jan: Carbon sandwich frame
[2025-02-06T11:40:48] Jason: how bout 2:1 lol

[2025-02-06T20:46:35] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: First rule of scooter club ahahah
[2025-02-06T20:47:09] haku: last year my hairline was fine. idk what happened
[2025-02-06T20:47:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Feel for u I'm trying to get rid of dandruff
[2025-02-06T20:59:16] haku: elons tech is my only hope now

[2025-02-06T21:02:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <video_file>
[2025-02-06T21:31:21] Matthew: Which will blow up? I have a lonnyo 65h 22x3 motor. 85150 controller. 90amp battery and been running 150 amps phase. Someone else in here or another says they're running like 300 amps on a 100amps battery. They mentioned top end won't reach 300amps but starting out it can hit the amps commanded. I have 90amps battery and will not go over 150amps phase.
[2025-02-06T21:35:45] Matthew: What exactly do you want to see? I have 65h 22x3 lonnyo motor. I have spintend single ubox 85150 vesc. I have anywhere from 210-280 phase amps and 90 battery amps. FW And any other setting does absolutely nothing to change output and recorded rt max and avg
[2025-02-06T21:36:54] haku: maybe vesc is firmware limited to 150a. not sure
[2025-02-06T21:38:01] Matthew: I think i have unlimited 🤔 running 6.05fw.
[2025-02-06T21:39:52] Matthew: Anything over 150 amps phase would make me more than happy. I see people posting something wild like 70amps battery and 250 phase. Like how tf does that even work if I can't go over 90 battery and 150 phase, even with 70amps FW
[2025-02-06T21:40:54] Smart Repair: ok, then there is certainly no Mosfet temperature limitation etc... sorry
[2025-02-06T21:41:04] haku: whats your battery capable of?
[2025-02-06T21:44:48] Smart Repair: 65H lonnyo 85150 ubox

[2025-02-06T21:46:56] Jan: Nobody ever tried 33x2 65H 10inch?
[2025-02-06T21:46:59] Smart Repair: I'm not quite sure anymore. I think it was 110 batt
[2025-02-06T21:47:12] Basti: Oh nice 20s right
[2025-02-06T21:47:13] haku: single?
[2025-02-06T21:47:38] haku: single would suck balls
[2025-02-06T21:48:24] haku: unless with the new high discharge tabless cells and big vesc
[2025-02-06T21:49:38] Jan: Dual
[2025-02-06T21:49:54] Jan: Single 22x3 even sucks
[2025-02-06T21:50:11] haku: thats what Matthew running
[2025-02-06T21:50:33] haku: he needa more juice imo big vesc or dual motor
[2025-02-06T21:52:59] Smart Repair: 70h 22x3 + stock GT1
[2025-02-06T21:55:27] haku: it peels out? thats why it bounces like that?
[2025-02-06T21:55:51] haku: thats quick
[2025-02-06T21:57:07] Smart Repair: yes, the front is lifted and still spins even at 100kmh
[2025-02-06T21:57:35] haku: what battery and vesc on this
[2025-02-06T21:59:43] Matthew: How in the hell. All I keep seeing is people posting 3x battery and benfine where I can demand 1.2amps
[2025-02-06T22:01:36] haku: gps this badboy and claim world record in your area
[2025-02-06T22:01:49] haku: that acceleration is nuts
[2025-02-06T22:03:03] Smart Repair: 20s9p 40p, Front 150 ubox, rear 250. in 1-2 weeks I will convert to front 250 and rear x12
[2025-02-06T22:04:33] Smart Repair: GPS it was 115kmh. That is also the maximum. Vdrop is too high. I will have to build a new battery soon
[2025-02-06T22:06:21] haku: i boozled on how you guys do it. mine is 81mph and vesc and motor got hot
[2025-02-06T22:06:51] haku: and doesnt accelerate like yours

[2025-02-06T22:14:25] haku: the aftermath was worth it imo. blown vescs always a trophy
[2025-02-06T22:15:26] Yamal: In the end everything is experience gained
[2025-02-06T22:16:05] haku: i think you should put a chain on that blown tronic and wear it on your neck.
[2025-02-06T22:16:21] haku: ultimate flex
[2025-02-06T22:23:22] Smart Repair: Yes, I know... but it still has to be able to do a few km/h 🤏
[2025-02-06T22:32:32] Yamal: Cooking soul xD

[2025-02-07T04:30:15] Noname: I want one of these and you need a 500$ camera
[2025-02-07T04:36:30] haku: we need the best for youtube content. need good low light and stability
[2025-02-07T04:36:39] haku: whats the cheapest option for that
[2025-02-07T04:36:55] Noname: Idk rarley even take pics
[2025-02-07T04:37:27] haku: something can take sd cards and can record for long periods.
[2025-02-07T04:39:02] haku: i forgot who told me to buy a used go pro 11 to helmet mount
[2025-02-07T05:32:57] Yamal: I want to build
[2025-02-07T05:45:46] Yamal: I misunderstood, I thought you were referring to the new project,,, I'll probably try the engines in the Nami to see how they go,,
[2025-02-07T05:48:39] Yamal: and if I like how they go in the nami, well they stay in the,, I just hope it has enough phase and battery to be able to move them""
[2025-02-07T05:53:06] haku: i got 2 new power stages with older mosfets @jamessoderstrom. is there a possibility that the logic board is fried
[2025-02-07T05:54:03] haku: need to buy 3 more logic boards so i can repair my old ones. then have em as spares
[2025-02-07T05:54:55] haku: fucking hell who blows 3 vescs in less than a 6 months
[2025-02-07T05:55:06] haku: only yours truly baby
[2025-02-07T05:56:53] Yamal: Just thing happen
[2025-02-07T05:57:04] Yamal: Mount nice heatsink
[2025-02-07T05:57:42] haku: maybe ill have to make a custom case to fit both. kinda like dual with 1 heatsink
[2025-02-07T05:57:57] haku: or 1 cooling block
[2025-02-07T05:58:25] haku: or just get 22x3 and be done with it
[2025-02-07T05:59:44] haku: 2 powerstages still cheaper than 2 nd72450
[2025-02-07T06:00:58] Yamal: The truth is that I would love to give the nami 75h 22/3.. xD because I really don't have much voltage or a stratospheric discharge, but we'll see what happens
[2025-02-07T06:01:20] haku: wepoor is a money sinkhole
[2025-02-07T06:01:57] haku: riding the jetson with my boy gave me much more enjoyment tbh
[2025-02-07T06:02:44] haku: we need pitbikes now. offroading is our thing
[2025-02-07T06:02:50] Yamal: The only thing wepoor need it’s just heatsink
[2025-02-07T06:03:02] haku: true dat
[2025-02-07T06:04:41] haku: i just like building things man. thats why i really built the wepoor. riding too is fun but the tickets and always watching out for cars is not fun
[2025-02-07T06:05:31] haku: btw peak g30v2 sneak peak battery
[2025-02-07T06:08:05] Yamal: It is a very expensive hobby
[2025-02-07T06:09:26] Yamal: I make the excuse that it is my vehicle to go to work,,, XD,, my kawa
[2025-02-07T06:09:58] haku: its prolly faster way to get there than riding at traffic stops
[2025-02-07T06:12:07] haku: 18 fet needs to come out asap
[2025-02-07T06:12:36] haku: bigger vesc is needed for heavier vehicles imo
[2025-02-07T06:16:09] Yamal: For me, the e-scooter is full freedom of mobility without having to pay insurance/technical inspection/road tax and also refuel.
[2025-02-07T06:16:28] haku: its going to be mounted like this.
[2025-02-07T06:16:51] haku: agreed. no liscence too
[2025-02-07T06:17:59] haku: peak g30 v2 is dual 16x4 and p42 cells
[2025-02-07T06:18:22] haku: this gonna be the skatepark king
[2025-02-07T06:21:29] Yamal: Nice frame
[2025-02-07T06:21:58] haku: i really wanted to finish this but wepoor just keeps breaking
[2025-02-07T06:22:45] haku: need a welder to weld brake mounts
[2025-02-07T06:22:47] Yamal: but the batteries don't see it that way, any collision makes the battery a sandwich
[2025-02-07T06:23:20] haku: very true. need a hard case
[2025-02-07T06:23:41] Yamal: a custom box in the triangle Would the chassis be ideal?
[2025-02-07T06:23:47] haku: my initial thought is mounting to frame. but also need a welder for that
[2025-02-07T06:23:59] haku: triangle too small
[2025-02-07T06:24:20] Yamal: True
[2025-02-07T06:24:47] haku: you can prolly fit a 36v 2p on that triangle. i want 72v
[2025-02-07T06:25:10] Yamal: 30s better hehe
[2025-02-07T06:25:19] Yamal: Like Jason
[2025-02-07T06:25:27] haku: sure. if theres a cheap vesc out there
[2025-02-07T06:25:50] Yamal: 40pl and x12
[2025-02-07T06:26:16] Yamal: 80h 17/4
[2025-02-07T06:26:20] haku: is x12 even tested yet? all fantasies and imagination for now that vesc
[2025-02-07T06:26:57] haku: i wanted to get it tbh. they have a sale 2 boards no case for 500
[2025-02-07T06:27:17] haku: not bad deal but need to make a custom case
[2025-02-07T06:27:40] Yamal: It seems that the first generations of x12 came with some problem with the hall sensor module? I think it's resolved,
[2025-02-07T06:28:16] Noname: @Bradhaku found your next E vehicle since the wepoor keeps sticking it in your well...
[2025-02-07T06:28:23] haku: in the end of the day its still a 12 mosfet design
[2025-02-07T06:28:56] Noname: Watercolor that thing
[2025-02-07T06:29:03] haku: send it to me. ill start a buisness with it in the desert with no grass
[2025-02-07T06:29:08] Noname: Ali radiator and block is cheap
[2025-02-07T06:29:25] Yamal: But Infineon tolt I want to see x12 in racer scooter how they can work,,
[2025-02-07T06:29:45] haku: you know whats also cheap. nd72450
[2025-02-07T06:30:03] Noname: I just want warmth and sunshine, snow sucks
[2025-02-07T06:30:14] Yamal: Me too

[2025-02-07T06:34:44] haku: seven has that vesc controller been tested?
[2025-02-07T06:35:25] haku: i dont want to be a beta tester when buying these. it needs to be polished
[2025-02-07T06:35:57] Yamal: I think so, but we hope that their performances come to light soon..
[2025-02-07T06:36:13] haku: we need numbers here.
[2025-02-07T06:36:20] haku: for x12 and seven
[2025-02-07T06:36:30] Yamal: GPS too right
[2025-02-07T06:36:34] haku: yes
[2025-02-07T06:37:08] haku: like i said last year. whoever claims first dual seven and 40pl will be world champ of big dick scooters
[2025-02-07T06:37:33] haku: but numbers and gps has to be logged
[2025-02-07T06:38:25] haku: thats the champion of champs across the globe. not regional world champ but world world champ
[2025-02-07T06:39:37] haku: if i get sponsorship i will do it. i have the space in wepoor for all that 😜
[2025-02-07T06:39:37] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-02-07T06:40:01] Yamal: I was satisfied with Raphael's 150kmh torque engines.
[2025-02-07T06:40:08] Yamal: XD

[2025-02-07T07:06:18] Yamal: Don’t know 33/2 modified maybe
[2025-02-07T07:12:39] Yamal: The frame is on its way, Ups say.. , it will arrive on Monday..
[2025-02-07T07:32:51] Yamal: Nami 21st century

[2025-02-07T07:32:53] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2025-02-07T07:47:52] Yamal: But maybe because the speed motor you have,,?
[2025-02-07T07:49:26] haku: dunno maybe. windy day too lots of drag
[2025-02-07T07:49:55] Yamal: Pretty nice
[2025-02-07T07:52:37] haku: i think the old mosfets not the hy ones were better for high current
[2025-02-07T07:54:41] Yamal: 122kmh no it’s a lot for 33/2
[2025-02-07T07:54:52] Yamal: Now i see
[2025-02-07T07:56:42] Yamal: could you get 135 easy

[2025-02-07T07:58:51] haku: one and done
[2025-02-07T07:59:14] haku: 20s 525a discharge battery.
[2025-02-07T07:59:32] haku: just need proper cooling for one big pull
[2025-02-07T08:00:03] haku: who?
[2025-02-07T08:02:16] Yamal: We will see what speed I can reach with 33/2, I just hope that the torque is not greatly reduced,,
[2025-02-07T08:02:28] Yamal: Your torque okee?
[2025-02-07T08:02:58] haku: not bad with 250bat 300phase
[2025-02-07T08:03:14] haku: it just heats up when riding in highways
[2025-02-07T08:03:19] Dualtron Achilleus: Tjack a guys doinf race
[2025-02-07T08:04:33] Yamal: 250A batt I can’t
[2025-02-07T08:05:44] Yamal: I’m 10p 40t just i want confortable A for my battery , not be near to the limit..
[2025-02-07T08:05:49] haku: yes can. try and just feel motor temps
[2025-02-07T08:05:59] Yamal: Planing use 175max
[2025-02-07T08:06:44] haku: add a motor temp sensor dude
[2025-02-07T08:06:53] haku: ntc10k

[2025-02-07T08:11:16] haku: get 10mm imo.
[2025-02-07T08:11:53] haku: 10mm vs 8mm
[2025-02-07T08:13:29] haku: 8mm such a small hole to solder thick wires
[2025-02-07T08:14:59] Yamal: My roadmap is marked by rage-mechanichs and RFP performance, it is a clear example of doing things well and obtaining excellent results.
[2025-02-07T08:15:50] haku: i guess yea.
[2025-02-07T08:16:19] haku: copy and paste builds i guess
[2025-02-07T08:18:47] Yamal: OF COURSE
[2025-02-07T08:19:52] Yamal: They have the experience, on many occasions when we go, they already come back
[2025-02-07T08:22:14] Yamal: I have not seen scooters better prepared for competition than the ones they have, absolutely everything they build is made of the best components
[2025-02-07T08:22:15] haku: be original like jaguar commercial
[2025-02-07T08:22:32] Yamal: Yes

[2025-02-07T08:26:50] Dualtron Achilleus: 2500€batterie
[2025-02-07T08:26:58] Yamal: Lesss

[2025-02-07T08:27:25] haku: dooo iiit. ebike guy style
[2025-02-07T08:27:55] haku: less than 2k built. doubt it
[2025-02-07T08:28:18] haku: copper needed for that will be thick .3 atleast
[2025-02-07T08:29:15] haku: people that can weld that thick copper will not charge cheap
[2025-02-07T08:29:48] haku: unless you go with premade buss bars
[2025-02-07T08:29:48] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-02-07T08:29:55] Dualtron Achilleus: Made vy who.
[2025-02-07T08:29:57] Dualtron Achilleus: ?
[2025-02-07T08:32:13] Yamal: Another option is to buy the cells and all the material and give it to someone to make the battery.
[2025-02-07T08:33:32] haku: make sure its a trusted battery maker. your 40pl might come back welded 40p
[2025-02-07T08:34:44] haku: well you can always check the resistance of the pack to make sure you did not get jipped
[2025-02-07T08:35:31] Yamal: For me the battery the last Thing
[2025-02-07T08:35:58] Yamal: Because when all it’s ready just order the battery , put in and 🌋
[2025-02-07T08:36:03] haku: thats the most expensive part of the build imo
[2025-02-07T08:36:16] Yamal: Sevenx2
[2025-02-07T08:36:22] Yamal: 1200$
[2025-02-07T08:36:35] haku: batterys cost more
[2025-02-07T08:36:58] Yamal: Of course
[2025-02-07T08:37:16] Yamal: Very expensive project
[2025-02-07T08:37:31] Yamal: Need to find lucky strike
[2025-02-07T08:37:36] Yamal: Hehe
[2025-02-07T08:38:02] haku: if i was there ill weld it for you. too bad yours truly ismt your neighbor

[2025-02-07T08:39:33] Yamal: XD
[2025-02-07T08:39:58] haku: how much does that cost to build in shop
[2025-02-07T08:40:28] Yamal: Soon I can ✖️on the motor
[2025-02-07T08:40:42] Yamal: Shop impossible man
[2025-02-07T08:42:01] haku: do they sell all these or this is your list?

[2025-02-08T14:48:26] GABE: they'll melt
[2025-02-08T14:48:31] GABE: i need to get a 350w immediately
[2025-02-08T14:48:35] GABE: Daniel is giving me one
[2025-02-08T14:48:40] GABE: 300w melts
[2025-02-08T15:04:47] Smart Repair: MISO will be adc2 at least my guess
[2025-02-08T15:18:00] Jason: ehh
[2025-02-08T15:18:09] Jason: esx motor strong
[2025-02-08T15:32:20] GABE: This 2p would melt an 800w blade if I hooked it up. I think I just need to watch the phase amps
[2025-02-08T15:32:45] Smart Repair: spintend ubox has identical rx, tx, adc2, adc3
[2025-02-08T15:33:28] GABE: I was using 35 there and it was enough
[2025-02-08T16:53:44] Noname: Today we get snowstorm ❄️

[2025-02-08T18:24:45] Noname: It sounds fun but as an adult it sucks.
[2025-02-08T18:31:28] haku: you know what not cutting and arranging the bms wires might be an actual good idea. you can reuse the harness on another build without buying a new one
[2025-02-08T18:32:14] haku: i always think of the positive
[2025-02-08T18:36:16] GABE: that's why I kept em.
[2025-02-08T18:36:34] GABE: that's getting rebuilt when I have the time
[2025-02-08T18:37:46] haku: dude do you still have your 70h? work on that and leave this one be. that one should have all the amps
[2025-02-08T18:38:02] GABE: True
[2025-02-08T18:38:28] haku: dont let those motors be a display in your wall
[2025-02-08T18:39:28] haku: if you dont want to put it in a g30. lets be real its hard to fit. get a different frame
[2025-02-08T18:40:15] haku: i will still love you on a kuugo. no judgement here boy.
[2025-02-08T18:48:01] GABE: waiting to go on a run
[2025-02-08T18:48:09] GABE: It'll be fine.
[2025-02-08T18:48:45] GABE: There's less space in this m365 the cell is destroying the JST
[2025-02-08T18:49:03] haku: put padding
[2025-02-08T18:51:05] GABE: alr done
[2025-02-08T18:56:53] haku: i need to stop doing this to myself. i already quit this last year. the demons came back and got a hold of me.
[2025-02-08T18:58:22] haku: this is why no sixpack this summer
[2025-02-08T19:00:53] haku: do you think they will laugh at me if i go to rehab for chocolate?

[2025-02-08T20:39:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Lot looks similar
[2025-02-08T20:41:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Like cobra pz5 has full similar inner ring
[2025-02-08T20:41:24] haku: i know. this one from china and takes dot4 fluid. pretty good
[2025-02-08T20:41:56] haku: clone for sure

[2025-02-08T20:51:28] haku: no. i have mt5 i doesnt look like that
[2025-02-08T20:52:36] haku: i dont want to mount it to wepoor because wepoor theme is for chinamen by chinamen.
[2025-02-08T20:56:08] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: That's Magura ☺️

[2025-02-08T21:25:03] haku: looks very sleek
[2025-02-08T21:25:17] haku: you can convert to brembo for that price
[2025-02-08T21:26:15] haku: howcome we dont see moto brakes on scooters yet. these are faster than some motorcycles
[2025-02-08T21:26:37] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Brembo would be complicated to put on a scooter the calipers are very thick
[2025-02-08T21:28:10] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: To brake faster you need a larger disc when you try to brake the scooter at 150 km/h the discs get very hot and you can brake or force
[2025-02-08T21:30:07] haku: thats why moto brakes is a good idea right?
[2025-02-08T21:30:24] haku: just need a cnc conversion
[2025-02-08T21:30:39] haku: mounting 6hole to 3hole caliper

[2025-02-08T21:59:55] Face de Pin Sucé: Body kit, not frame 😊
[2025-02-08T22:00:53] haku: down force and some intake cooling holes eh
[2025-02-08T22:02:10] haku: thats actually a good idea. when going too fast you need aerodynamics
[2025-02-08T22:04:45] Lieven L.: Maxima might be good but there are no spare parts for it and they are way to expensive. I prefer Magura MT7 with HC3 Lever. 👌
[2025-02-08T22:05:31] haku: help me yamal. my lower back is fucked for some reason. i cant squat heavy
[2025-02-08T22:05:56] haku: how much that setup cost?
[2025-02-08T22:06:02] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Magura only likes the tweezers are the same mt5 and mt7
[2025-02-08T22:06:33] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: the difference between mt5 and mt7 is the bomb
[2025-02-08T22:06:56] Yamal: take on less kilos,,,
[2025-02-08T22:06:59] haku: whats bomb? big difference?
[2025-02-08T22:07:50] Lieven L.: Yeah they are not much different. But i have MT7s and they are sweet.
[2025-02-08T22:08:45] haku: is mt5 good enough for 130kmh stoping?
[2025-02-08T22:09:00] Lieven L.: I can get a used pair for like 220€
[2025-02-08T22:09:08] Lieven L.: Yes
[2025-02-08T22:09:35] haku: its just the mt5 levers is plastic
[2025-02-08T22:11:38] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: mt5 and mt5 are the same only the brake pump changes
[2025-02-08T22:11:47] haku: i will go to local gym and work legs there. i cant do complex movements. use machines. this is bad
[2025-02-08T22:12:19] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: mt7 you brake more because the brake pump pistons are larger everything else is the same one as the other
[2025-02-08T22:15:27] Yamal: Surely there are Mexican women there taking photos in the mirrors, don't talk to them about the Tesla! Tell him that you don't have money, that you are a student at VESC university
[2025-02-08T22:17:36] haku: i will walk there as a warmup
[2025-02-08T22:18:33] haku: the latinas dont like the chinos
[2025-02-08T22:18:50] haku: they like the black mambas
[2025-02-08T22:18:53] Yamal: You Hawaii right
[2025-02-08T22:19:11] haku: yea asian/pacific islamder
[2025-02-08T22:19:26] haku: the eyes cant lie
[2025-02-08T22:19:39] haku: thats why i always wear sunglasses to conceal
[2025-02-08T22:20:48] Yamal: Wear sunglasses, and tell them that you don't plan to sign anything, that you are a free soul
[2025-02-08T22:21:47] haku: i tell em you have to pay to play
[2025-02-08T22:21:55] Yamal: tell them you're bruce lee's cousin
[2025-02-08T22:22:16] Yamal: hehe
[2025-02-08T22:22:31] haku: i tell em if you go out with me its like a tombolo. you never know what you getting
[2025-02-08T22:23:50] Yamal: I'm kidding, enjoy the workout!
[2025-02-08T22:24:22] Yamal: Tomorrow I try to do something in homeee , let’s see with the cold lazy to train ..
[2025-02-08T22:24:32] haku: tombolo is true story though
[2025-02-08T22:24:43] Yamal: Tómbola
[2025-02-08T22:24:56] haku: yes that
[2025-02-08T22:25:04] Yamal: La vida es una tómbola

[2025-02-08T22:26:37] haku: lol
[2025-02-08T22:52:11] Jan: Full carbon fiber frame you have to know what you are doing. Full FEA, professional laminators etc. I think doing bodykits is really great. I would the same but my next projects too slow for that
[2025-02-08T23:05:22] Yamal: Jogi at work !

[2025-02-08T23:11:46] haku: jetson bolt would be perfect for this work
[2025-02-08T23:11:52] haku: lightweight
[2025-02-08T23:13:21] haku: it would suck in the summer though
[2025-02-08T23:13:59] Yamal: He always say inmotion rs,, his favourite
[2025-02-08T23:14:17] haku: are there inmotions in spain?
[2025-02-08T23:14:23] Yamal: Yes
[2025-02-08T23:14:26] Yamal: There are some
[2025-02-08T23:14:33] Yamal: In my city not..
[2025-02-08T23:14:49] haku: ive never seen anyone build on that frame
[2025-02-08T23:14:58] Yamal: Me too
[2025-02-08T23:14:59] haku: frame looks good
[2025-02-08T23:15:04] Yamal: Yes ..
[2025-02-08T23:15:26] Yamal: But not very pretty for me ..
[2025-02-08T23:15:40] Yamal: But stable …
[2025-02-08T23:16:00] Yamal: Like good geometry
[2025-02-08T23:16:01] haku: yea. looks very stable
[2025-02-08T23:16:11] haku: theres one in my local shop
[2025-02-08T23:16:27] haku: ill ask if i can test ride
[2025-02-08T23:17:40] haku: if i can get one. ill cut the stem and put a seat
[2025-02-08T23:18:09] Yamal: You can make lower the stem
[2025-02-08T23:18:14] Yamal: NO need to cut
[2025-02-08T23:18:20] haku: nice
[2025-02-08T23:18:36] haku: still too high for a seat though
[2025-02-08T23:18:36] Yamal: Never see some review? ..
[2025-02-08T23:19:08] haku: it also looks like a vsett display wich you can turn into vesc display
[2025-02-08T23:20:44] haku: some bicycles have carbon frames. crack it and its done son
[2025-02-08T23:21:10] haku: even carbon rims
[2025-02-08T23:23:07] haku: can full carbon carry the weight of big heavy batteries and parts?
[2025-02-08T23:36:58] Lieven L.: Well you can still repair them. But its not ideal yeah. You don't want the fibre to be broken at any point.
[2025-02-08T23:39:04] haku: carbon frame and rim
[2025-02-08T23:39:55] haku: its cracked thats why its for home use
[2025-02-08T23:41:03] haku: its good if your cycling or competing in the highest levels but for daily not ideal
[2025-02-08T23:44:57] Lieven L.: Yeah that's why all the racers have training bikes and racing bikes. But the carbon isn't the problem. It's the focus on saving weight anf making everything as light as possible.
[2025-02-08T23:45:38] haku: theres even carbon bmx trick bikes.
[2025-02-08T23:45:55] haku: idk how thats possible.
[2025-02-08T23:50:17] Lieven L.: It's just thick walls instead of coke can wall thicknesses
[2025-02-08T23:50:31] haku: oh i see
[2025-02-08T23:51:46] Yamal: https://youtu.be/iXW_tnz1lHs?si=D6MNhvR2VbSLwt_8
[2025-02-08T23:51:59] Yamal: Long time ! They are back!
[2025-02-08T23:53:31] Lieven L.: I actually prefer carbon over aluminum bikes since carbon is more durable over time and will last longer. Unless you overload it of course.
[2025-02-08T23:55:59] haku: steel for me. weight doesnt matter
[2025-02-08T23:56:07] haku: old school
[2025-02-08T23:59:08] Lieven L.: Well it really depends on the use case. Moving steel or any other weight uphill under your own power is quite exhausting 😉
[2025-02-09T00:00:14] Lieven L.: Modern cars have aluminum doors, hoods and fenders for a good reason.
[2025-02-09T00:00:23] haku: true
[2025-02-09T00:00:36] haku: for impact yea
[2025-02-09T00:04:04] Lieven L.: Mostly for weight.
[2025-02-09T00:11:35] Finn: Now put a motor in that bad boy

[2025-02-09T09:39:40] David: Ohh boy Where to begin. As of the right picture it a prior starting the battery, just a measurements for customer approval. You can clearly see in that video That each following group has isolation using 3 layers of kapton tape(green color,attaching picture) As of the left picture I think you need glasses as same here every following group has also 3 layers of kapton(orange color)

[2025-02-09T11:20:04] Jason: imho
[2025-02-09T11:20:20] Jason: sticking kapton/fish between the cells is more time waste than holder

[2025-02-09T17:38:29] Yamal: Let's say that there are several kinds of olive oils, in the sense that they reduce them, the worst being the olive pomace oil, and the old one and the purest "extra virgin"
[2025-02-09T17:40:32] Jan: Arne?

[2025-02-09T19:35:40] Yamal: Not really, everything remains the same, interurban roads and running more than 25kmh are not allowed, until 2027 we are still legal." I only move on roads outside of town.. but in the cities there are fines and people are tired of the pressure, also everyone with a large thunder ultra type vehicle: "Nami they are selling it because in 2027 it will not be legal to drive with it unless you homologate and certify it, so it is expected that it will be quite expensive..
[2025-02-09T19:39:00] haku: thats cool that highways are legal. atleast
[2025-02-09T19:39:43] Yamal: No legal man

[2025-02-09T21:21:26] Finn: I have designed an adapter for the Ubox 85150 and the Ubox Lite 100V 100A which is used instead of the original Ninebot controller. I am looking for at least 10 people who want this adapter, otherwise the unit price is too high. My asking price for the adapter with at least 10 people is about 40€ per piece + shipping (shipping from Germany) Im ordering a sample to confirm that everything fits then ill go out and collect everything for the main order. If yall interested leave a 100% emoji

[2025-02-10T21:26:55] Yamal: It does not suit you, if you want to continue training
[2025-02-10T21:30:55] haku: this has been my routine for a long time. when in pain lift less i guess

[2025-02-10T23:15:29] Yamal: RFP riding the wave
[2025-02-10T23:21:11] haku: how big is the battery box?
[2025-02-10T23:21:22] haku: compared to regular box?
[2025-02-10T23:24:49] Yamal: I think 15cm bigger
[2025-02-10T23:24:56] Yamal: For mount the controller
[2025-02-10T23:25:02] haku: dang thats alot more space
[2025-02-10T23:25:23] Yamal: Yes , also with 22s battery
[2025-02-10T23:25:56] haku: you into deep. i cant keep up with you papi
[2025-02-10T23:26:13] Yamal: is clearly specified
[2025-02-10T23:26:36] haku: 2 sevens for real?
[2025-02-10T23:27:24] Yamal: I think it is possible, they are only one centimeter longer than the ubox
[2025-02-10T23:27:42] haku: dam you will be worlds fastest boy!
[2025-02-10T23:28:10] haku: rolex wearing, limosine riding, jet flying son of a gun.
[2025-02-10T23:28:30] Yamal: <photos/photo_21476@10-02-2025_23-28-30.jpg>
[2025-02-10T23:28:58] Yamal: Nahh
[2025-02-10T23:29:01] haku: shuls are as big as sevens yea. or smaller?
[2025-02-10T23:29:08] Yamal: Smaller
[2025-02-10T23:29:19] Yamal: 13 point something
[2025-02-10T23:29:19] haku: perfecto
[2025-02-10T23:30:42] haku: lets see this badboy running boy
[2025-02-10T23:30:52] Yamal: Everything that is missing is very expensive, you have to go to sleep and dream for a while xD
[2025-02-10T23:31:08] haku: use your nami bat for now
[2025-02-10T23:31:08] Yamal: I need I mean
[2025-02-10T23:31:11] Yamal: XD
[2025-02-10T23:31:19] Yamal: Nop
[2025-02-10T23:31:36] Yamal: It’s my vehicle, can’t do this to the Nami ..
[2025-02-10T23:31:59] Yamal: In this frame only can go in 22s11p Eve 40pl
[2025-02-10T23:31:59] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-02-10T23:33:50] haku: dam you are the chosen one. i told the prophecy last year who will have 40pl and seven is world champ
[2025-02-10T23:34:16] haku: let me find the post
[2025-02-10T23:36:31] haku: mount 2 qs motors
[2025-02-10T23:36:58] haku: and seat
[2025-02-10T23:37:39] Yamal: Don't believe that I haven't thought about it, but that was resolved a few days ago... and I'm not going to dismantle the Nami to use the Thunder,,, the Nami is an excellent vehicle for daily use and routes, due to the cushioning, robustness, etc.,,, I'm going to take the Thunder slowly because it's very expensive to finish everything and I've decided to do it in a top way, for the Nami by mounting the speed motors and testing them. I agree, I have already spoken with the factory, in case it doesn't convince me and the torque seems very reduced, order about 75h 22/3,, if any case,,,, if I love the speed motors in the nami, then stop it! and in the future I ask for other similar ones for the thunder
[2025-02-10T23:38:29] Yamal: I plan to try them with 600A phase and between 350 \ 400A battery to see how it goes
[2025-02-10T23:38:31] haku: use the 80h motors and test em though
[2025-02-10T23:46:36] haku: i will call you big balls from now on
[2025-02-10T23:47:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 135mm shit the 75200 pro V2 is 130 and fits perfectly in my scot
[2025-02-10T23:47:52] Yamal: Just yamal haku rider
[2025-02-10T23:48:13] Yamal: The project it’s little by little
[2025-02-10T23:48:17] haku: now from this day on you shall be called big balls
[2025-02-10T23:48:36] Yamal: Tomorrow morning: -y0000000000000000
[2025-02-10T23:48:41] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-02-10T23:49:19] haku: where are todays riding videos big balls?
[2025-02-10T23:50:11] Yamal: Just waiting for the next Saturday 18°C max
[2025-02-10T23:50:21] Yamal: Very nice for ride the wave
[2025-02-10T23:50:25] haku: ill be tuned big balls
[2025-02-10T23:51:10] JPPL: <video_file>
[2025-02-10T23:52:19] haku: haha
[2025-02-10T23:52:37] Yamal: You can see the big balls there with 5 scooter ,,?xD
[2025-02-10T23:53:15] haku: i mean 1 big balls scooter. 7 and 40pl
[2025-02-10T23:54:08] Yamal: This the dream o the thing I want.. but for now no seven no 40pl
[2025-02-10T23:54:17] Yamal: XD mucha pasta
[2025-02-10T23:54:44] haku: dont let it be dreams. i can see it happening by this summer
[2025-02-10T23:55:25] Yamal: We see but with the kids and wife the money it’s fly
[2025-02-10T23:56:02] haku: they prolly land on your private jet. then picked up by a limosine
[2025-02-10T23:56:06] Yamal: But yes i try to do slowly
[2025-02-10T23:57:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: They cost a lot 2 of them is my monthly paycheck
[2025-02-10T23:58:09] Yamal: If I had a stroke of luck and became enormously rich, I would buy a pair of 7/18s from each of this group with a trip included to Benjamin's land to find him! find it!
[2025-02-10T23:58:23] haku: yes its pricey
[2025-02-10T23:59:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Less pricey then nuc (f12 and not from website rather local sellers)
[2025-02-10T23:59:36] haku: remember who loved you when you were not rich. yours truly. i want a harley
[2025-02-11T00:01:59] Yamal: qs motors for wepoor, seven 30/32s controllersx2 and 32s 12 p Eve 40pl battery
[2025-02-11T00:02:09] haku: thank you big balls
[2025-02-11T00:03:19] haku: i want a blank harley frame to convert to electric though
[2025-02-11T00:03:32] haku: thats what im expectimg from you
[2025-02-11T00:07:29] Yamal: You really like Harley Davison
[2025-02-11T00:08:02] haku: not really. i just chose the most expensive frame since we are expecting free stuff
[2025-02-11T00:09:02] haku: it looks so comfortable to ride on seems like
[2025-02-11T01:05:26] Matthew: That's what I'm wanting.... 60h 17x4 winding. I like rwd as it's predictable to me
[2025-02-11T01:13:40] Rose: Hey there Louis, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-02-11T01:55:14] haku: peak g30 owning all the kids.
[2025-02-11T09:17:09] Maximus Brokus: Hi friends. I wanted to install an ignition key on the old single heatbox 100v 100a, but the Ignition port doesnt give any voltage. Do I need to set a jumper somewhere or is it software shizzle?
[2025-02-11T09:25:04] GABE: no software shizzle. you wired it wrong. Careful.
[2025-02-11T09:25:16] Maximus Brokus: Me nothing
[2025-02-11T09:25:24] Maximus Brokus: I just put the wire into the plug
[2025-02-11T09:25:32] Maximus Brokus: It just read 0.3v
[2025-02-11T09:25:49] GABE: you must have switched a wire or ignite is fucked
[2025-02-11T09:26:43] Maximus Brokus: Litterly dunno what you can do wrong with that
[2025-02-11T09:27:11] GABE: does button work instead
[2025-02-11T09:27:15] Maximus Brokus: Yes
[2025-02-11T09:27:28] GABE: I'll leave this to the lords, sorry
[2025-02-11T09:27:51] Maximus Brokus: Dunno what you can do wrong on the ignition port besides wiring vbatt to gnd :D
[2025-02-11T10:06:02] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Wow so cringe ur not allowed to enjoy yourself too fast https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSMdT6E71/
[2025-02-11T12:07:13] Eren: <video_file>
[2025-02-11T12:07:17] Eren: Allthat for a g2
[2025-02-11T12:12:02] GABE: External micro pack maybe?
[2025-02-11T12:21:33] GABE: so small could put it on the railing
[2025-02-11T12:21:35] GABE: thin
[2025-02-11T12:30:59] JPPL: 3 cables, gnd to gnd, supply + maybe is not red, red Will give further power but can receive from "green"? Could be
[2025-02-11T12:31:06] JPPL: Show the Key
[2025-02-11T12:33:08] JPPL: Example:
[2025-02-11T12:33:12] JPPL: <photos/photo_21478@11-02-2025_12-33-12.jpg>
[2025-02-11T12:33:12] JPPL: <photos/photo_21479@11-02-2025_12-33-12.jpg>
[2025-02-11T13:52:17] Dualtron Achilleus: How do you guys modifie vesc controlor to get more power
[2025-02-11T13:52:38] Dualtron Achilleus: I ear guys changing mofstet and other thing
[2025-02-11T13:55:21] Dualtron Achilleus: Like ubox 85 150 doing 500phasr
[2025-02-11T13:55:22] Dualtron Achilleus: Phase
[2025-02-11T14:40:33] Jason: mmm
[2025-02-11T14:40:49] Jason: if it's 18650 I think I can put inside esx deck lol
[2025-02-11T15:05:07] GABE: Nah
[2025-02-11T16:29:45] haku: external to xiaomi?
[2025-02-11T16:30:19] Dualtron Achilleus: Argue
[2025-02-11T16:30:19] GABE: yeah a little cube
[2025-02-11T16:30:29] GABE: would fit in one hand
[2025-02-11T16:30:58] GABE: 900wh then total
[2025-02-11T16:31:14] GABE: just need a 20a 20s BMS or something
[2025-02-11T16:31:17] GABE: I want it micro yk
[2025-02-11T16:31:18] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-02-11T16:31:25] haku: just leave xiaomi alone and save cells for 70h
[2025-02-11T16:32:06] haku: youll end up putting 70h on that xiaomi if you dont stop
[2025-02-11T16:35:00] GABE: Only one for now
[2025-02-11T16:35:03] GABE: with the 2p
[2025-02-11T16:35:21] GABE: gonna have so much accel and so little range lol
[2025-02-11T16:38:03] Patrick: 500phase, not possible
[2025-02-11T16:39:41] Dualtron Achilleus: Why
[2025-02-11T16:39:56] Patrick: Because its to much
[2025-02-11T16:40:10] Patrick: Also the 250A version not can doing 500Phase
[2025-02-11T16:40:48] Patrick: Its ratet for around 411A, but on chinese paper
[2025-02-11T16:40:52] Yamal: 6fet..
[2025-02-11T16:40:56] haku: i will have 20s3p on my little minibmx peakg30v2. and thats dual motors. no range im sure you will be fine
[2025-02-11T16:41:18] Patrick: Yes but 500 its to much, not a question
[2025-02-11T16:41:25] haku: just dont pin it. p42 such a wasted cell on that motor
[2025-02-11T16:42:27] haku: get high capacity cells since your not using all the amps
[2025-02-11T16:44:00] Yamal: I mean It is true, some modify with 100v components for a higher voltage and thus a little more Amperes, but asking the 6 spintend fets to work with 500A phase safely is practically impossible, I think.
[2025-02-11T16:44:46] haku: good morning mr. big balls @jamaludin_algarnati! where is my harley
[2025-02-11T16:45:03] Yamal: 100v o 150v componentes think
[2025-02-11T16:45:28] Yamal: Morning haku rider
[2025-02-11T16:47:47] Yamal: Well, I don't know, the truth is I haven't had that stroke of luck yet, maybe you will have it before me and you will be the one who buys me the seven/ controllers and the 40pl battery.
[2025-02-11T16:48:32] haku: nono. you will have the glory of owning sevens first. i will not steal your glory
[2025-02-11T16:49:24] Yamal: I think you have to see people already testing these controllers! find them!
[2025-02-11T16:49:26] Dualtron Achilleus: Why bot put 500A mofset then?
[2025-02-11T16:49:27] Yamal: :)
[2025-02-11T16:49:29] Dualtron Achilleus: Bot
[2025-02-11T16:49:55] haku: no one so far. maybe im in the wrong place.
[2025-02-11T16:50:51] Yamal: 1250€…. Seven 18/24 x2
[2025-02-11T16:51:12] haku: mucho dineros. hope its quality stuff
[2025-02-11T16:52:38] Yamal: a lot of pasta,it would be good to see how they work with a battery capable of producing 700A continuous
[2025-02-11T16:53:26] haku: let my prophecy be fullfiled and do it
[2025-02-11T16:53:48] Yamal: The good thing I also think is the small size of this electronic, compared for example to 3shull (700-1000-1400)
[2025-02-11T16:54:12] haku: or compare to fardriver 2x size 😭
[2025-02-11T16:55:34] Jan: This
[2025-02-11T16:55:46] Yamal: Yesterday this guy from Singapore gave me a schematic of an electronics that makes you fall backwards, but of course he doesn't have the cut by Benjamin Vedder
[2025-02-11T16:56:01] Jan: Height is too much again
[2025-02-11T16:56:41] Dualtron Achilleus: What it means
[2025-02-11T16:56:56] haku: its too big? bigger than ubox?
[2025-02-11T16:58:05] Yamal: Yes, maybe x12 with 12fet could compete, but first you have to see both electronics working with 300A battery and 500 phase in a stress situation...
[2025-02-11T16:58:39] Jason: only 6 fets
[2025-02-11T16:58:45] Jason: like
[2025-02-11T16:58:51] haku: @Un_Jason release your beast 18fet
[2025-02-11T16:58:53] Jason: 6fet 500 phase? impossible
[2025-02-11T16:58:58] Jason: it always has been
[2025-02-11T16:59:06] Jason: someone need to build it and test
[2025-02-11T16:59:15] haku: oh i see
[2025-02-11T16:59:50] Jason: https://github.com/NormalHuman-Anything
[2025-02-11T16:59:51] Dualtron Achilleus: Okay jsut need more space that what it means
[2025-02-11T16:59:54] Jason: GESC_Logic and GESC
[2025-02-11T17:00:03] Jason: smolblabla branch on both
[2025-02-11T17:00:14] Jason: moar components also
[2025-02-11T17:00:30] Yamal: send 2 to desert to be tested by Kimbo with moli moli
[2025-02-11T17:00:50] Jason: lol
[2025-02-11T17:00:57] Jason: kinda waiting for daniel to build

[2025-02-11T17:00:58] Yamal: XD
[2025-02-11T17:01:03] Jason: but maybe ill build it first
[2025-02-11T17:01:06] Jason: xd
[2025-02-11T17:01:20] Jason: not sure if not properly working at 84v is fixed or not
[2025-02-11T17:01:31] Jason: hope it was just INA240 acting up
[2025-02-11T17:01:55] haku: someone build this badboy
[2025-02-11T17:02:04] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-02-11T17:02:14] Yamal: Kimbo..
[2025-02-11T17:02:23] Jason: ill gonna order the boards probably
[2025-02-11T17:02:28] haku: lmao. RIP kimbo
[2025-02-11T17:02:35] Jason: gotta see if local board builder can do IMS
[2025-02-11T17:02:35] Yamal: What
[2025-02-11T17:02:44] Jason: source components and then blabla
[2025-02-11T17:02:48] Jan: Height is an issue
[2025-02-11T17:02:56] Jan: Why everyone creating blocks
[2025-02-11T17:03:08] Jason: mines compac
[2025-02-11T17:03:12] Jason: hehe
[2025-02-11T17:03:26] Jason: can extend up to 6k uF if i stack the capacitor
[2025-02-11T17:03:34] Jason: wait 8k
[2025-02-11T17:04:46] Yamal: You need a great chassis to test your electronics and be able to sell them.
[2025-02-11T17:04:54] Yamal: Big chasis I mean
[2025-02-11T17:05:09] Yamal: For mount your 30s30p
[2025-02-11T17:05:20] Yamal: Seven 30
[2025-02-11T17:05:21] Jason: this esc is only 20s rn
[2025-02-11T17:05:30] Jason: gonna maybe try to redesign for 30s
[2025-02-11T17:05:42] Jason: ims and fr4 combo board
[2025-02-11T17:05:50] Yamal: I think you want make one for 30s..
[2025-02-11T17:05:58] Jason: yeah i really want to
[2025-02-11T17:06:10] Jason: after finishing open source 32s vesc bms
[2025-02-11T17:06:52] Jason: or i can just redesign logic board only xd
[2025-02-11T17:07:10] Jason: if current power board doesnt suffer at 30s lol
[2025-02-11T17:15:11] 'lekrsu': Too much torque, front lifts 🥂
[2025-02-11T17:15:45] Yamal: Single motor
[2025-02-11T17:17:11] Yamal: if good benjamin saw you..🥺
[2025-02-11T17:17:14] Yamal: 😭
[2025-02-11T17:17:27] 'lekrsu': 2025 goals, drive to Vedder
[2025-02-11T17:17:34] 'lekrsu': <animation>
[2025-02-11T17:17:58] Yamal: If you saw him on the street, you would stop it right?
[2025-02-11T17:19:45] Yamal: If I saw him on the street, time would stop
[2025-02-11T17:20:46] Yamal: I think it would be best if you suggested inviting him to lunch.
[2025-02-11T17:22:58] Yamal: Then it would be time to tell him how the scene of the global panorama around the Vesc world is, even if he already knows it, so that he knows your perspective and thus begins to make a roadmap
[2025-02-11T17:23:53] Yamal: what started with fire, may end with fire xD
[2025-02-11T17:23:53] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-02-11T17:27:55] Matte: Omg what a mess
[2025-02-11T17:30:53] Jason: 2025 goal fly to sweden
[2025-02-11T17:31:04] Jason: meet vedder you and some others
[2025-02-11T17:38:07] Yamal: Nice barnamish
[2025-02-11T18:21:29] haku: has anyone here met vedder personaly face to face?
[2025-02-11T18:27:04] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/rdav1rwXuWw?si=_5Kf_AZC-TZmP6yY
[2025-02-11T18:38:17] haku: now thats a ride right there

[2025-02-11T19:29:11] haku: senior bolas grandes! @jamaludin_algarnati
[2025-02-11T20:00:29] Yamal: Just yamal better
[2025-02-11T20:00:56] Yamal: Yamal Vedder Wallace
[2025-02-11T20:03:02] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Hey
[2025-02-11T20:03:41] Yamal: Hakimbo rider xD
[2025-02-11T20:03:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Buying a 85150 now how much phase amps does it rated for ?
[2025-02-11T20:04:33] Hackintoshhhh: Rated for 150
[2025-02-11T20:04:37] Patrick: 150A because the name is 85V 150A
[2025-02-11T20:04:48] Hackintoshhhh: Can do 380a on better fets 100%
[2025-02-11T20:05:01] Hackintoshhhh: I have tokmas 500a fets in mine
[2025-02-11T20:05:01] Patrick: But it can do more because have some room
[2025-02-11T20:05:12] Hackintoshhhh: Never tested 500a but hw is there
[2025-02-11T20:05:18] Patrick: I drive it with 230A and we will see how long it does that power
[2025-02-11T20:05:34] Patrick: I think 250A can also be possible
[2025-02-11T20:05:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 150 battery amps no ?
[2025-02-11T20:05:39] Hackintoshhhh: I drive on 240a since last august
[2025-02-11T20:05:53] Hackintoshhhh: No issues on jmsh1001atl or tokmas
[2025-02-11T20:06:31] haku: 240 battery?
[2025-02-11T20:06:50] Hackintoshhhh: 160-180a battery
[2025-02-11T20:07:02] haku: wow. thats good to hear
[2025-02-11T20:07:18] haku: its stock or modified?
[2025-02-11T20:07:26] Hackintoshhhh: Now, modified
[2025-02-11T20:07:30] Hackintoshhhh: 500a mosfet
[2025-02-11T20:07:35] haku: nice
[2025-02-11T20:07:52] Hackintoshhhh: He saw my tiktok where i said 500a 85150 he messaged me there
[2025-02-11T20:07:56] Hackintoshhhh: That’s why he asked
[2025-02-11T20:08:10] haku: i see
[2025-02-11T20:08:15] Hackintoshhhh: 500a output 100% not but mosfet 500a rated yes
[2025-02-11T20:08:37] haku: i dont have tiktok. would be cool if you can share it here
[2025-02-11T20:09:00] haku: can you do that to a 12fet? change fets to 500a?
[2025-02-11T20:09:14] Hackintoshhhh: <video_file>
[2025-02-11T20:09:35] Hackintoshhhh: Yes, but the fets are not good due to high RDSon, according to james
[2025-02-11T20:09:43] Hackintoshhhh: They heat a bit but reliable af
[2025-02-11T20:09:58] haku: oh i see
[2025-02-11T20:10:17] haku: i dont know what that means but what james says i believe
[2025-02-11T20:10:50] Hackintoshhhh: Haven’t had issues myself but james knows better 100%, i just like to fuck around if i know how to fix if i „find out“
[2025-02-11T20:11:12] haku: ide like to try. i have 3 spare dead stages
[2025-02-11T20:11:34] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I just spoke with u on TikTok u fallow me
[2025-02-11T20:12:16] Hackintoshhhh: Stage 1: Fix stock jmsh1001atl
[2025-02-11T20:12:28] Hackintoshhhh: Stage 2: Swap to sh1001atlq-13
[2025-02-11T20:12:46] Hackintoshhhh: Stage 3: James thai mosfet he recommended me to try
[2025-02-11T20:12:55] haku: ill be hakimbo just for black history month okay. but that guy only fought street bums. when he turned pro to fight in ufc. no ground game
[2025-02-11T20:13:15] Hackintoshhhh: ATL and ATLQ wayy diff mosfets, atlq can do 479a
[2025-02-11T20:13:35] haku: cant defend a takedown. only street brawler
[2025-02-11T20:14:06] Yamal: actually in my opinion you are more like Mauwi
[2025-02-11T20:16:30] haku: gotcha. ill mess around with it.
[2025-02-11T20:16:48] haku: i dont even know where to source these fets
[2025-02-11T20:47:40] Yamal: …… just change for the one come with Nami when i buy..
[2025-02-11T20:49:02] Yamal: <photos/photo_21481@11-02-2025_20-49-02.jpg>
[2025-02-11T20:49:09] haku: ali very very cheap
[2025-02-11T20:49:22] haku: no need for fancy grips
[2025-02-11T20:50:07] Yamal: Just mount this wepoor too xD
[2025-02-11T20:50:20] haku: save money for big balls parts
[2025-02-11T20:50:20] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-02-11T20:50:33] Yamal: 🤣
[2025-02-11T20:50:44] haku: i have all ali china everything
[2025-02-11T20:51:02] haku: exept cells
[2025-02-11T20:51:13] haku: but 40pl might complete the set
[2025-02-11T20:53:48] Yamal: But true , Ali have many tipes grips , nice and cheap
[2025-02-11T20:54:27] haku: the ones i use is from choice i think. very comfortable
[2025-02-11T20:54:44] haku: $2 grips
[2025-02-11T20:57:18] haku: i might also change my throttle to ali throttle. like my kids throttle instead of spinny
[2025-02-11T20:57:18] Yamal: 4-5 okee
[2025-02-11T20:57:19] Hackintoshhhh: Lcsc
[2025-02-11T21:10:35] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Hey I have 85150 is it ok for front motor (less power) 60h paired with 72/36 220a battery? Or too underpowered
[2025-02-11T21:10:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: *?
[2025-02-11T21:21:15] haku: here watch this before visiting vedder. you have to know the history and culture or you might accedentally be disrespectul. https://youtu.be/HrG6LNhoBTE?si=WqFpLNDYynjLRDTl
[2025-02-11T21:22:45] haku: according to history the vikings was very advanced. they used vesc boats and never rowed or sailed. they had the first machine guns
[2025-02-11T21:43:51] Eren: 1000w sound 💪❤️
[2025-02-11T21:57:38] Felix: Isn't that a ximi 4 lite gen 2? 24V thingy
[2025-02-11T22:11:28] Eren: Changed the battery just cant see it
[2025-02-11T22:11:37] Eren: But stock yea its 24v
[2025-02-11T22:14:26] haku: https://youtube.com/shorts/iV56EhdxTPU?si=PJbB0w0BSNn4GuLB
[2025-02-11T22:14:56] haku: this is why learning to weld is necessary
[2025-02-11T22:28:52] Matthew: https://youtu.be/ekmCbElS5hU?si=eAczswPbtfqVa7f9
[2025-02-11T22:29:27] haku: that dude is a legend
[2025-02-11T22:29:57] haku: thats why i dont lift heavy in public gyms. he might be mopping
[2025-02-11T22:30:23] Matthew: Hahaha
[2025-02-11T22:31:04] Matthew: Dude, i was strong working in the shipyard.... but this dude i think is made of steel lol
[2025-02-11T22:37:52] Matthew: Both phase and battery is 150 amps each
[2025-02-11T22:38:12] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Thanks
[2025-02-11T22:40:25] Matthew: You're welcome.
[2025-02-11T22:45:46] Matthew: What do you want to do again? You have a 85150 ubox paired with 60h motor? And battery is 220 amps bms? 150amps battery max and if your vesc unit stays cool enough someone told me they're running 230amps phase and I do believe was 150amps battery
[2025-02-11T22:47:16] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'll be very happy if I can get such high settings on it without overheating
[2025-02-11T22:50:22] Matthew: As far as someone was telling me is use good thermal paste and make sure good heat sink and I suppose a fan wouldn't hurt. I've looked into some all-in-one liquid cooling options computers use and seem like would be good. But space can be limited for your setup
[2025-02-11T22:51:35] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Cooling plate half outside the scooter with the air cooling it is what I want to do
[2025-02-11T22:54:03] Matthew: I'm assuming you should be good. There's thermal max parameters you set so that if it starts getting hot it throttles back on power and if it keeps getting hotter it will shut off.
[2025-02-11T22:54:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also are thermal pads ok ?
[2025-02-11T22:54:32] Matthew: <photos/photo_21343@06-02-2025_03-29-36.jpg>
[2025-02-11T22:54:35] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like instead of paste
[2025-02-11T22:55:04] Matthew: That ride spooked me when power cut out
[2025-02-11T22:55:16] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Sorry bro but 48mph for me not enough
[2025-02-11T22:55:38] Matthew: I'm just showing the temps
[2025-02-11T22:55:55] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm going for something like 120-130kmh
[2025-02-11T22:56:56] Matthew: I'm able to go faster... but I'm just running 65h 22x3 single motor. Jan from jrev is running 65h 33×2 dual motor and 20s is hitting him around 85mph.
[2025-02-11T22:57:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I see 96c
[2025-02-11T22:57:44] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Mine is 60h 22/3 but dual and 72 with high discharge
[2025-02-11T22:58:55] Matthew: Yeah, was running late to work and was going 40+ mph for a while and then the vesc cut power fast based on what I had programmed so your vesc will be fine.
[2025-02-11T22:59:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And it's only for the front also
[2025-02-11T23:00:46] Matthew: Someone was letting me know that single 60h 17x4 with field weakening he could hit around 50mph. Not sure what dual 60h 22x3 will get you. But I'd imagine you should be close to the speeds you want.
[2025-02-11T23:01:07] Matthew: Mine is just rwd
[2025-02-11T23:02:39] Matthew: Was told 65h 22x3 dual will get me around 70mph on 16s
[2025-02-11T23:02:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 80mph is My target but with those motors I don't know
[2025-02-11T23:03:15] Matthew: Yeah that's pretty fast haha.
[2025-02-11T23:03:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I did 62 on 50h zero10x motors but lot of fwk
[2025-02-11T23:04:28] Matthew: Basically same here. I was running dual vsett 10+ motors with a lot of fw and hit 63mph, it was still climbing a bit in speed but that was plenty fast for me
[2025-02-11T23:05:16] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: That's a thunder 2 it can handle those speeds stock is 110 so need faster to justify not going for stock escs
[2025-02-11T23:07:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 110kmh 68mpg *
[2025-02-11T23:25:50] haku: boys it has begun.

[2025-02-11T23:26:22] haku: bask in the beauty of this peak g30v2
[2025-02-11T23:26:45] haku: its james holders 20s3p p42
[2025-02-12T00:15:04] Eren: I have a thunder 4 and it can handle with ease
[2025-02-12T00:21:45] Matthew: Yeah, I'm on a g30lp haha. And I don't have the speedforks on mine
[2025-02-12T00:40:59] Noname: It's half the size of the bike
[2025-02-12T00:41:26] Noname: Should have used 2 g30 motors
[2025-02-12T00:47:58] Rose: Hey there skrtt, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-02-12T01:04:27] haku: nah this is 50h can handle more current
[2025-02-12T01:04:37] haku: this is 10"
[2025-02-12T01:28:38] JPPL: Lets rock!
[2025-02-12T02:22:32] haku: you a navyman or coast guard?
[2025-02-12T03:20:47] Rose: Hey there skrtt, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-02-12T03:21:43] skrtt: Hello guys
[2025-02-12T03:21:55] skrtt: I have one question if u could help
[2025-02-12T03:23:15] haku: ask away buddy
[2025-02-12T03:23:19] skrtt: Does anyone know how much peak power can i put on victor motors
[2025-02-12T03:23:23] skrtt: At 60v
[2025-02-12T03:24:30] skrtt: Im gonna install c350 from 3shul and for now im limited to 100A cuz of the bms. And im not sure if 50A on one motor would be too much
[2025-02-12T03:25:13] skrtt: It will jump from 2,1Kw to 3.3Kw
[2025-02-12T03:33:51] haku: do you know the magnet size and winding by any chance?
[2025-02-12T03:34:40] skrtt: I dont bro :/. A friend of mine that is in this group said that its “maybe” (maybe) 50h
[2025-02-12T03:35:14] haku: im guessing 16x4. 50a sounds about right
[2025-02-12T03:35:37] skrtt: I cannot find any specification abt that motor. Some people say its 800/1000w nominal power. Thats all i know
[2025-02-12T03:35:46] haku: idk wait for the dualtron owners to chime in
[2025-02-12T03:36:04] skrtt: I dont know what 16x4 referes to
[2025-02-12T03:36:30] haku: winding
[2025-02-12T03:36:51] haku: not sure though. might be 22x3 then you can push more amps
[2025-02-12T03:37:42] skrtt: Whats its winding? I just know basic stuff :\
[2025-02-12T03:43:19] haku: lets say its like gears. some take little amps to accelerate fast and some need big amps to get the same acceleration
[2025-02-12T03:48:13] Noname: That's fine. It's a good quality scoot. I'm at 4x power on my vsett stock motors
[2025-02-12T03:48:49] skrtt: Hmmm gonna check that out. So bigger numbers like 22x3 takes less amps to have same acceleration compared to 16x4?
[2025-02-12T03:49:15] Noname: Backwards
[2025-02-12T03:49:26] skrtt: Oh ok i get it
[2025-02-12T03:49:36] Noname: Fast motor 22x3 needs lots of power to get rolling
[2025-02-12T03:50:11] Noname: Like starting car in 3rd gear
[2025-02-12T03:50:36] skrtt: So its like de difference between the same motors ex 70h and manufactur says “torque” “medium” and “speed”?
[2025-02-12T03:51:12] haku: yep
[2025-02-12T03:51:26] skrtt: Im still scared because i see that almost all the motors can peak at double their rated power (maybe a little more)
[2025-02-12T03:51:26] Noname: Yeah winding is like gearing slow med high
[2025-02-12T03:51:40] Noname: 70h is magnet that's horse power
[2025-02-12T03:52:17] skrtt: So it has to do with the size of the little cables inside (¿copper?)
[2025-02-12T03:52:39] haku: if you have a temperature sensor thats best way to see
[2025-02-12T03:52:46] skrtt: Smaller size bigger top speed Bigger sizer more torque
[2025-02-12T03:53:02] skrtt: I do not have
[2025-02-12T03:53:11] skrtt: Dualtron 🥲
[2025-02-12T03:53:52] haku: 16 is the copper strands turned 4 times i think is what 16x4 means
[2025-02-12T03:54:54] skrtt: Another thing. Will i benefit that much in installing hall sensors so i can have sine wave instead of square?
[2025-02-12T03:55:10] haku: imo yes
[2025-02-12T03:55:22] skrtt: Is that easy?
[2025-02-12T03:55:33] Noname: You don't need halls
[2025-02-12T03:55:36] skrtt: And cheap 😅
[2025-02-12T03:55:48] Noname: You just have to push start without
[2025-02-12T03:55:51] skrtt: To have sinewave?
[2025-02-12T03:56:24] skrtt: i do think i need hall sensors to have sinewave
[2025-02-12T03:56:26] haku: big balls halls is what they say.
[2025-02-12T03:56:33] haku: need em
[2025-02-12T03:56:36] skrtt: Mixed opinions my guys
[2025-02-12T03:56:46] Noname: Nope
[2025-02-12T03:57:03] skrtt: Thats what my engineer said
[2025-02-12T03:57:12] Noname: I have my shut off after a certain rpm
[2025-02-12T03:57:35] Noname: Just to start from 0mph yes
[2025-02-12T03:57:36] skrtt: But thats not truly sinewave ig
[2025-02-12T03:57:53] skrtt: Oh u have ur sensor turned of

[2025-02-13T07:41:24] Arnau Martinez Casals: Its different, you can use it in All brakes but you gonna broke it if they aren’t prepared for dot4 Or 5.1. The lip seal is not prepared for dot4/5.1 they are too corrosive for the sealents

[2025-02-13T13:32:48] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Hello friends, as you well know, I have the 3-schul v4 controllers damaged. My question is if anyone has the schematic to be able to solve the problem or otherwise I wouldn't know what to do to repair it.
[2025-02-13T13:44:46] Paolo ⁭: I have also 11 for sell 60h, but this is 50h
[2025-02-13T13:46:04] Smart Repair: Do you have a photo of the 11" 60H? Price and windings?
[2025-02-13T13:47:02] Smart Repair: is it a lonnyo with 138mm dropout?
[2025-02-13T14:47:20] GABE: I'll take it for 125.

[2025-02-13T15:25:59] Andrei Albert: I dont have 3d print
[2025-02-13T15:27:33] Jan: Ah the "big name university" people, think they ate knowledge with a spoon and now know it all better than everyone else. Fresh out from the school. Always a classic 👏
[2025-02-13T15:32:14] Patrick: No bigger dropout
[2025-02-13T15:32:22] Patrick: 120mm i think
[2025-02-13T15:34:19] skrtt: Fresh out of school?? Hes fckng 37 bro. And graduated with prestige. If u dont know ur stuff better stay quiet my guy
[2025-02-13T15:35:05] Finn: knowledge =! knowledge
[2025-02-13T15:35:08] Jan: Someone is triggered af
[2025-02-13T15:36:06] Jan: I wont engage in electrical engineering discussions since im a mechanical engineer. Always open to learn from people but it has to be a common consensus and not a whack opinion
[2025-02-13T15:36:19] skrtt: Im not triggered u just talk shit for no reason bro. And even u are a mechanical engineer so ur beefing yourself too?
[2025-02-13T15:36:50] Jan: What?
[2025-02-13T15:37:12] Mirono escooters: You need halls to start from 0 or low speed Above x kmh (around 5) you witch to sensorless and rely on backemf feedback
[2025-02-13T15:37:51] skrtt: So i do need
[2025-02-13T15:38:08] Mirono escooters: I'd suggest to move this stupid discussion to offtopic, this spam isn't helping. You can read up on how sine works and what halls do. Also, encoders exist. so no, halls aren't needed. Ever
[2025-02-13T15:38:18] Mirono escooters: You can't push start a few kmh?
[2025-02-13T15:38:48] Mirono escooters: The only reason bldc "works" better at 0 start is because it throws a shit ton of amps at it in hopes it will go to the right direction. It's bullshit and stupid. No one should use bldc in this day and age.
[2025-02-13T15:38:48] Finn: Sure you can push uncontrolled amps in the controllee to get the rotor in position but thats not a good way😂
[2025-02-13T15:39:55] Finn: Just throw amps at it and it will fix the problem😄
[2025-02-13T15:44:32] Mirono escooters: Yes no prob

[2025-02-13T17:43:12] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I saa only 130h not 100
[2025-02-13T17:43:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 130 will be too wide
[2025-02-13T18:00:09] Pandalgns: I asked China to buy them
[2025-02-13T18:00:47] Pandalgns: But it has a lot of modification to adapt them
[2025-02-13T18:02:51] Dualtron Achilleus: Mia say tonme they now produc 100h
[2025-02-13T18:02:57] Dualtron Achilleus: Its 183mm open size
[2025-02-13T18:03:10] Dualtron Achilleus: I want to know the kv rated of these
[2025-02-13T18:03:57] Pandalgns: He told me that right now there are the 80h and the following are 100h
[2025-02-13T18:05:13] Dualtron Achilleus: Are you going to take a 100h?
[2025-02-13T18:05:37] Dualtron Achilleus: Do you thing its work with the tubless rims
[2025-02-13T18:08:50] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: he is very crazy
[2025-02-13T18:09:47] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I would put 75/80h 22s but he wants 24s100h 🤣🤣🚀🚀🚀
[2025-02-13T18:29:08] Pandalgns: Probably, for now I am going to stay with my 60h, the MKS 84200 and 20s molicel but in a time I intend to put 100h, 3shul 400A phase controllers, 30s adapt the front and rear suspension and reinforce the chassis
[2025-02-13T18:31:12] haku: what 100h?
[2025-02-13T18:31:52] haku: is it a same size stator or bigger?
[2025-02-13T18:34:12] haku: @jamaludin_algarnati cancel 80h order and go 100h
[2025-02-13T18:35:53] haku: halls or kick start like peasants is what i was told
[2025-02-13T18:57:27] Pandalgns: Need 33mm more 🤔🤔
[2025-02-13T18:57:35] Pandalgns: I have 150mm
[2025-02-13T19:09:29] Dualtron Achilleus: Hum sad , with dualtron its easy to have 183mm
[2025-02-13T19:11:20] Dualtron Achilleus: Same i guess
[2025-02-13T19:26:03] Noname: It's not even kick like a stock g30. Literally 1/2 inch forward and take off
[2025-02-13T19:31:36] haku: still have to use force. is it good to use in stop and go traffic?
[2025-02-13T19:43:09] Pandalgns: With the halo I need to make the shock absorbers supports ... 200 or 300 euros in a metal workshop 😂😂 nice 😉
[2025-02-13T19:43:29] Pandalgns: Money, money and more money
[2025-02-13T19:43:32] Pandalgns: 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
[2025-02-13T19:45:27] haku: just add a little get more get a new frame. 300 euro crazy
[2025-02-13T19:46:21] haku: i can vouch for wepoor frame.
[2025-02-13T19:47:52] Smart Repair: What are the alternatives to the 250 ubox with a little more power?
[2025-02-13T19:48:30] Pandalgns: Yes, I know ... with 70h I do not need to enlarge the space, with 80h if and with 100h.... bfff
[2025-02-13T19:49:04] haku: just get lomger bolts
[2025-02-13T19:51:28] Face de Pin Sucé: I say so
[2025-02-13T19:52:03] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_21521@13-02-2025_19-52-03.jpg>
[2025-02-13T19:52:39] Pandalgns: I need to separate the shock absorbers to be able to put more than 70h, the supports have to be made from zero larger
[2025-02-13T19:59:05] skrtt: Im sure u are the best then
[2025-02-13T19:59:23] haku: oh thats right. i forgot the front
[2025-02-13T19:59:36] haku: the rear just needs longer bolts
[2025-02-13T19:59:55] haku: well custom cnc is expensive
[2025-02-13T20:01:20] Face de Pin Sucé: You say something wrong, don't take it personally 🤣
[2025-02-13T20:01:36] Andrei Albert: Someone who can help me with a spinted setup?
[2025-02-13T20:01:54] haku: theres a 13" version of that frame that has wider ones. bigget frame too
[2025-02-13T20:05:15] Dualtron Achilleus: So sad dor you mf
[2025-02-13T20:05:42] skrtt: I came here saying that i dont know that much about electronics. And for some reason u say that my mechanic (which is also a very good friend) is not an engineer
[2025-02-13T20:05:49] skrtt: So yes i take that personally
[2025-02-13T20:13:22] Mirono escooters: He is wrong.. soo, we corrected him
[2025-02-13T20:13:47] Mirono escooters: Now this discussion is over or I'm muting
[2025-02-13T20:13:50] haku: do you need to kick still?

[2025-02-13T20:15:05] haku: i also need to get educated on this topic
[2025-02-13T20:29:43] Mirono escooters: It's just throwing shit at each other
[2025-02-13T20:30:05] Mirono escooters: We told the facts, you can continue with facts, but not with replying to each other and bitching
[2025-02-13T20:30:18] Mirono escooters: I said discussion over, not subject Aanyway
[2025-02-13T20:35:30] haku: im in no position to help but just wondering what this new project of yours is. what exactly the motors and battery?
[2025-02-13T20:37:25] Noname: Yes seated is annoying. But on scoot you end up moving your body forward and "Hit the ground running" as they say.
[2025-02-13T20:37:52] Noname: Not trotting along like walking your show pony g30 stock bs
[2025-02-13T20:38:30] haku: you do you even kick going uphill sitting down. i used jetson with no halls. i have to run then jump and sit
[2025-02-13T20:38:48] haku: i guess it has its uses
[2025-02-13T20:44:18] haku: son of a dick. its raining outside.
[2025-02-13T20:44:36] haku: peak g30 is not fully waterproof

[2025-02-13T21:07:23] Smart Repair: I need a Mosfet board for the 250 ubox and a logic board for the 150. Spintend charges a fortune including shipping to Germany. Does anyone happen to have anything in stock?
[2025-02-13T21:13:03] Pandalgns: T107max
[2025-02-13T21:13:28] Pandalgns: But I don't know if the front shock absorbers come more separate
[2025-02-13T21:25:41] Noname: Small rotor big wheel you have less rotation vs travel than a scooter motor. Jetson sucks too
[2025-02-13T21:41:30] haku: holy shitballs. this guy is doing too much. https://youtube.com/shorts/rFefoAyTEEM?si=dLFOX9F2aI5CYdqg

[2025-02-13T23:35:22] Matte: what cell is that
[2025-02-13T23:45:02] Matte: They have them all facing the same way. What you have on the photo is normal orientation of cells in that battery pack.

[2025-02-14T01:33:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Already uploaded the firmware for 85200 so I think itl not show the same anymore
[2025-02-14T01:34:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I tried he insisted on not letting me use 72 Eeven after changing voltage
[2025-02-14T01:35:12] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is having that firmware problematic?
[2025-02-14T01:35:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Because that works for me
[2025-02-14T01:35:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: With 72 I mean

[2025-02-14T15:04:25] Noname: Messed up and missed bluetooth module on a vesc order. Emailed and got "ok no problem" to add one to my order. Is that a gift item 🤔 👀
[2025-02-14T15:21:13] 'lekrsu': Maybe, they're very cheap to manufacture 👀
[2025-02-14T15:25:25] Patrick: More amps
[2025-02-14T15:45:35] GABE: very nice
[2025-02-14T15:47:20] Noname: Yeah buying after + shipping forget that
[2025-02-14T15:48:33] Noname: @lekrsu you have alu lite vesc
[2025-02-14T15:49:09] 'lekrsu': yeah?
[2025-02-14T15:49:15] GABE: are there small transformers for 72v to 230v AC?
[2025-02-14T15:50:27] Noname: Usb-c is for programming?
[2025-02-14T15:50:48] Noname: How's temps on it
[2025-02-14T15:51:12] Noname: The new single?
[2025-02-14T15:51:15] 'lekrsu': yeah or their nrf5 bt dongle
[2025-02-14T15:52:17] 'lekrsu': Temps are great, using a 0.5mm thermal pad against steel chassi of G2
[2025-02-14T15:52:20] 'lekrsu': <photos/photo_21531@14-02-2025_15-52-20.jpg>
[2025-02-14T15:52:33] Noname: Does the regular one plug in also. Hope they send right one
[2025-02-14T15:52:53] 'lekrsu': The bt? Same for all
[2025-02-14T15:53:14] Noname: Nice I got the cooling plate 5$ why not
[2025-02-14T15:53:57] Noname: 3kw is prob max for now so it'll be nice if your at 5kw

[2025-02-14T18:17:43] Noname: You ask 4 2 much
[2025-02-14T18:18:04] Noname: Idk yet prob 4th vesc need 16$ part
[2025-02-14T18:26:34] haku: dude ive spent almost 2k with them

[2025-02-14T22:13:42] Smart Repair: I plan to equip my ESC with water cooling. Would it be possible to integrate an external temperature sensor into vesc?
[2025-02-14T22:14:24] Smart Repair: so that the performance can be throttled from a certain water temperature
[2025-02-14T22:19:09] haku: good idea
[2025-02-14T22:33:58] haku: gadam dog.
[2025-02-14T23:30:01] Noname: If not could you parallel another
[2025-02-14T23:33:16] haku: im on my wits end with this dog. dam he chewed my sons ipad pen.
[2025-02-14T23:42:53] Smart Repair: eg? I can't use Mosfet and motor sensor 🤔
[2025-02-14T23:43:10] Martin Kaktits: Son of a dog. Well, yeah 😃
[2025-02-14T23:43:59] haku: he is
[2025-02-14T23:44:41] haku: no wonder these kinda dogs are put up on adoption. i would never do that though
[2025-02-15T00:13:25] Noname: Food then?
[2025-02-15T00:30:25] haku: when the end of days. ill consider it
[2025-02-15T00:39:53] Noname: You'll prob get dog hair in your dog meat lol
[2025-02-15T00:53:01] haku: that boy will be skinned and i will wear his fur. thats how he will repay all the damages hes done. keeping me warm atleast
[2025-02-15T01:28:41] GABE: i mean if it has contact with air sure if it has fins
[2025-02-15T01:39:41] haku: i believe everything you say. you know that
[2025-02-15T02:15:26] haku: i found a new speciment for swole and project boys.
[2025-02-15T02:15:46] haku: its the pedal version of the bolt baby
[2025-02-15T02:17:42] haku: my man want 100 for it. its my neighbor
[2025-02-15T02:25:59] Noname: Supreme Jetson master v4 deluxe
[2025-02-15T02:26:53] haku: ill prolly end up removing pedals until laws come
[2025-02-15T02:33:26] Noname: But that's another 🍌 battery
[2025-02-15T02:34:00] haku: true. there is an stl for a bigger battery box. might fit 21700
[2025-02-15T02:34:39] Noname: I'm just worried about your street cred
[2025-02-15T02:35:56] haku: this can fit 14 wheels
[2025-02-15T02:36:07] haku: bigger motor is available for these.
[2025-02-15T02:36:22] haku: unlike the other bolt
[2025-02-15T06:00:16] NetworkDir: You can do it with motor sensor input and some lisp codes
[2025-02-15T06:04:02] haku: 1 water block for 2 vescs? is that a good idea?
[2025-02-15T06:05:26] Noname: Why not
[2025-02-15T06:05:49] haku: just wondering. i might do that actually
[2025-02-15T06:06:13] Noname: Be the same as 1 20kw controller or 1 for each basically
[2025-02-15T06:06:21] Noname: As far as size
[2025-02-15T06:06:38] Noname: Ohh mini radiator on the stem
[2025-02-15T06:06:49] Noname: Gonna be cooler than a polar bears paw
[2025-02-15T06:07:19] haku: yea i can fit that. it might be a cheaper solution that making cnc heatsink mounts
[2025-02-15T06:07:42] Noname: I saw one that was like perfect bolt holes for vesc
[2025-02-15T06:08:04] haku: wich vesc 12fet?
[2025-02-15T06:08:51] Noname: I just found this on AliExpress: $7.09 | 80mm Aluminum Water Cooling Radiator Computer PC Water Cooling System Part https://a.aliexpress.com/_mt68Ao7
[2025-02-15T06:09:26] haku: thats a radiator. where is the block
[2025-02-15T06:12:52] Noname: Looking
[2025-02-15T06:17:34] Noname: Idk.look tmrw need sleep.gotta work in few hours
[2025-02-15T09:05:57] Smart Repair: I plan with these components. The block fits perfectly for x12
[2025-02-15T10:45:07] Dualtron Achilleus: Active cooling nice
[2025-02-15T10:51:39] Rose: Hey there Joy, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-02-15T12:18:56] Smart Repair: Is there anyone here who has installed a water cooling system or has experience with it? I am not sure about the required flow rate of the pump. Currently I am leaning towards 800L/h which can/should be controlled via PWM depending on the temperature
[2025-02-15T12:29:36] Mirono escooters: Why would you get water cooling?
[2025-02-15T12:30:03] Mirono escooters: Overcomplicating stuff and just increases risk of disaster
[2025-02-15T12:32:50] GABE: wind cooling with extra steps
[2025-02-15T12:34:12] Smart Repair: In the summer I had the problem that the sun's rays heated the frame to over 50°C. Because of the water cooling, I want to get rid of the frame so that I can use the full power in the summer too. And I don't see water cooling as critical. Millions of vehicles are water-cooled, so why should it be bad in a scooter? 🤷‍♂️
[2025-02-15T12:35:09] Jan: Water cooling is to transport energy to somewhere where you have more space to do air cooling
[2025-02-15T12:35:34] GABE: In science terms
[2025-02-15T12:35:38] GABE: Yea
[2025-02-15T12:35:41] Jan: It can take up huge amounts of energy, making it perfect for localized heatspots
[2025-02-15T12:36:38] Arnau Martinez Casals: Any specialist on fieldweaking?
[2025-02-15T12:37:07] Arnau Martinez Casals: How many A I can put with 50h motor on 85150 spintend
[2025-02-15T12:38:46] Arnau Martinez Casals: <video_file>
[2025-02-15T12:41:56] Jan: Another question about field weakening. Why though? The way i see it, people have too powerful setups for their low kv motors, needing then to compensate the magnetic field with "wasted counter" current just to go faster. Why not just a higher kv motor to begin with when you have the powerful setup. Isnt the loss of power to field weakening just about the extras power you could pump into a higher kv motor to get the same acceleration?
[2025-02-15T12:42:21] Mirono escooters: It's a simple way to get more speed when you have leftover amps
[2025-02-15T12:42:41] Jason: it depends
[2025-02-15T12:42:44] Jason: it varies
[2025-02-15T12:43:03] Mirono escooters: And with it, you can have high torque with low kv motor, but still decent speed 🤷 I'm not the biggest fan of it, but see the point of it. My G30 will go awd and FW soon too. Gen1 motors xD
[2025-02-15T12:43:15] Arnau Martinez Casals: I recently burned the 100v100a with 20a fieldweaking
[2025-02-15T12:43:16] Jason: also seems like dash app doesn't have fwk setting so I really recommend using vesctool
[2025-02-15T12:43:44] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: You have to take into account several factors: the thickness of the cable, the A of the battery and Anything else
[2025-02-15T12:44:01] Arnau Martinez Casals: Yes it has All the parameters but is not added to rapid parameters
[2025-02-15T12:44:20] Arnau Martinez Casals: Quick* parameters
[2025-02-15T12:44:43] Arnau Martinez Casals: I can add more parameters
[2025-02-15T12:44:57] Jason: I wish i knew that 17x4 won't satisfy my speed desire earlier
[2025-02-15T12:45:02] Jason: 😭
[2025-02-15T12:45:14] Jan: The left over amps could also have been used for more accel on higher kv motors, thats what im saying
[2025-02-15T12:45:16] Jason: I maybe should've gone 22x3
[2025-02-15T12:45:25] Jason: single.
[2025-02-15T12:45:37] Jan: Daniel has 22x3 single
[2025-02-15T12:46:18] Jason: nearly everyone said 22x3 65h single wasn't a great idea
[2025-02-15T12:46:22] Jason: idk why
[2025-02-15T12:46:45] Jason: mm
[2025-02-15T12:46:53] Jan: Works fine i thinl
[2025-02-15T12:46:55] Jan: k
[2025-02-15T12:47:01] Mirono escooters: Yeah but amps
[2025-02-15T12:47:10] Jason: amps?
[2025-02-15T12:47:11] Jason: easy
[2025-02-15T12:47:13] Jan: I do dual 33x2, thats amp 😅
[2025-02-15T12:47:15] Mirono escooters: You can scale everything down with low kv
[2025-02-15T12:47:17] Jason: just use stronger esc
[2025-02-15T12:47:28] Jason: mine is capable of 22x3 already
[2025-02-15T12:47:32] Yamal: Doctor Jan speaking xD 🎩
[2025-02-15T12:47:37] Jason: maybe if I torture 33x2 😉
[2025-02-15T12:47:39] Mirono escooters: And this is why I have low kv on purpose 🤷
[2025-02-15T12:47:48] Mirono escooters: And also no desire for stupid high speed
[2025-02-15T12:47:51] Jan: 33x2 isnt as bad as people believe
[2025-02-15T12:47:54] Jason: I want
[2025-02-15T12:47:56] Jason: 100kmh
[2025-02-15T12:47:58] Jason: that's it
[2025-02-15T12:48:06] Jan: That thing has like 6-9mOhm resistance
[2025-02-15T12:48:12] Jason: going 30s with 17x4 for dpeed
[2025-02-15T12:48:44] Jason: I wanna illegaly import some 120x 40pl
[2025-02-15T12:48:45] Jan: 30S4P would be a great config if bms and controllers existet in that size required for g30
[2025-02-15T12:48:46] Jason: seriously
[2025-02-15T12:48:55] Jason: controller mp2
[2025-02-15T12:49:01] Jason: bms? random ant 32s one
[2025-02-15T12:49:09] Jason: Doing single so it's fine
[2025-02-15T12:49:12] Jan: 22-25mm height requirement
[2025-02-15T12:49:13] GABE: mp2s are taller than 85250 no?
[2025-02-15T12:49:20] Jason: gotta chec
[2025-02-15T12:49:36] Jan: If its thicker than 85250, it wont work
[2025-02-15T12:49:53] Jan: It can be like 110mm width or so
[2025-02-15T12:49:56] Mirono escooters: Tronic x12?
[2025-02-15T12:50:02] Jan: 24S
[2025-02-15T12:50:21] Mirono escooters: Am I going insane or did they have a 150v version
[2025-02-15T12:50:25] Mirono escooters: Problem the first
[2025-02-15T12:50:28] GABE: bad news for 10 inch enjoyers
[2025-02-15T12:50:35] Jason: did they?
[2025-02-15T12:50:40] Mirono escooters: I enjoy 10 inch a lot
[2025-02-15T12:50:50] Jason: same
[2025-02-15T12:50:52] Jan: <photos/photo_21543@15-02-2025_12-50-52.jpg>
[2025-02-15T12:50:53] Jan: Ah
[2025-02-15T12:50:57] Jan: But ita probably too tall
[2025-02-15T12:51:04] Jason: yeah
[2025-02-15T12:51:05] Jason: caps
[2025-02-15T12:51:14] Jan: Its always that damn caps
[2025-02-15T12:51:17] Mirono escooters: Did they just solder to the screw terminals Bwuh
[2025-02-15T12:51:28] Mirono escooters: Tronic already has so little
[2025-02-15T12:51:34] GABE: I believe 10 inch and mp2 is a no go height wise
[2025-02-15T12:51:34] Jason: mp2 is under 25mm
[2025-02-15T12:51:40] GABE: or am I wrong
[2025-02-15T12:51:42] GABE: wow
[2025-02-15T12:51:44] GABE: so it's good
[2025-02-15T12:51:45] Jason: about 22~23mm
[2025-02-15T12:51:47] Jan: Then it could work
[2025-02-15T12:51:54] Jason: yeah and it will work
[2025-02-15T12:52:06] Jason: glad I went wirh
[2025-02-15T12:52:08] GABE: mind showing pic?
[2025-02-15T12:52:10] Jason: only 5t alu plate

[2025-02-15T12:53:21] Jason: pills can be mounted lower by removing the headers
[2025-02-15T12:53:29] Jason: (no usb access anymore)
[2025-02-15T12:53:34] Jason: 😝
[2025-02-15T12:53:34] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jason has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-02-15T12:55:32] Smart Repair: When it comes to the 10" I was actually very satisfied. a good compromise
[2025-02-15T12:56:38] Jason: mmm
[2025-02-15T12:56:47] Jason: money has already been spent
[2025-02-15T12:57:00] Jason: so gonna extract what I could best from the motor
[2025-02-15T12:57:08] Jason: lets try to kill my mp2 ehehehe
[2025-02-15T12:57:24] Jason: lets see what fails first batt? motor? esc?
[2025-02-15T12:57:24] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jason has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-02-15T13:27:40] Hackintoshhhh: Very good idea
[2025-02-15T13:27:52] Hackintoshhhh: 500w mode 22kmh takes 7.4wh
[2025-02-15T13:28:07] Hackintoshhhh: Ulim when i push it takes 33wh
[2025-02-15T13:29:25] Jason: mmmmm
[2025-02-15T14:12:29] Noname: Volts and speed?
[2025-02-15T14:12:41] Jason: 60v
[2025-02-15T14:13:00] Jason: 73kph max with intense fwk w overmodulation
[2025-02-15T14:41:03] Smart Repair: for me it was ~85kmh with 72V and FW
[2025-02-15T15:30:08] francois schempers: the problem isn't generally with the motor but with the voltage, a 13s setup can't go much past 50km/h regardless of the Kv, FW is the hack to go past it without investing in a new esc and battery
[2025-02-15T15:49:52] Unknown: You dont need no extra hardware to go faster with field weakening
[2025-02-15T18:15:36] haku: good morning! wheres my offtopic buddies! @jamaludin_algarnati did the feds get you?
[2025-02-15T18:17:34] Noname: <animation>
[2025-02-15T18:19:19] haku: great! but @jamaludin_algarnati senior bolas grandes is absent
[2025-02-15T18:20:46] Noname: Probably doing things with stuff
[2025-02-15T18:21:30] 'lekrsu': batt😁
[2025-02-15T18:21:48] haku: true. need to get swole then weld the battery today
[2025-02-15T18:26:13] Marius: Sounds like a Plan
[2025-02-15T18:29:05] Noname: Ugh skip the swelling and focus on Haku industries
[2025-02-15T18:29:50] haku: is it riding season yet there?
[2025-02-15T18:30:32] Noname: Ha lol 28f and forecast of 5-8" snow tonight
[2025-02-15T18:40:21] haku: when does snow end there?
[2025-02-15T18:40:58] haku: when is riding season?
[2025-02-15T18:44:54] Noname: Another month and 1/2 snow mostly gone but freak storm here mabey. Day riding mabey April still cold at night till October days
[2025-02-15T18:57:43] Yamal: Morning ! No yet ! hehe
[2025-02-15T19:00:09] Yamal: https://youtu.be/rXmP9BtgxCE?si=O89u7cXpQpePbVMu
[2025-02-15T19:03:18] haku: dam that guy knows his scooter well
[2025-02-15T19:04:33] haku: thats my idea. taking mini bmx peak g30v2 to skatepark
[2025-02-15T19:11:24] haku: what is his name! his pretty good
[2025-02-15T19:31:27] Yamal: Thibaud
[2025-02-15T19:35:27] haku: what team does he scoot for?
[2025-02-15T19:36:08] Yamal: Ragemechanich
[2025-02-15T19:36:31] haku: wow. amazeballs. good for them. this dude looks like an athlete
[2025-02-15T19:36:36] francois schempers: Good evening boys !
[2025-02-15T19:37:20] haku: good evening! thats right i always forget time difference
[2025-02-15T19:42:10] haku: where did you get that block? custom cnc?
[2025-02-15T19:46:53] ✨🇪🇸عمر: <video_file>
[2025-02-15T19:46:53] ✨🇪🇸عمر: <video_file>
[2025-02-15T19:48:46] ✨🇪🇸عمر: So, I've had several CAN bus issues. When I was doing my motor detection, my front motor was running normally, but the rear one was completely going out of control. My motor was also vibrating when stationary, moving left and right. When I released my throttle, it would suddenly accelerate at full speed for about half a second. My ADC was going crazy, jumping from 20% to 100%. This happened since I switched to a 300X throttle instead of the Spin Y2.
[2025-02-15T19:49:08] ✨🇪🇸عمر: All of this started when I switched to the 300X because the Spin Y2 failed on me.
[2025-02-15T19:50:00] ✨🇪🇸عمر: I was able to partially solve the problem by separating the Bluetooth module, the CAN bus, and the throttle because I had them tied together with a plastic zip tie. I spaced them out properly, kept them away from the motor phases as well, and switched to BLDC mode to reduce the jerks caused by the throttle.
[2025-02-15T19:51:12] ✨🇪🇸عمر: Do you think all of this is caused by FOC interference, or should I shield my CAN bus or throttle to fix it, or maybe change something else?
[2025-02-15T19:51:12] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. ✨🇪🇸عمر has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-02-15T19:51:35] Smart Repair: from Ali. do you want the link?
[2025-02-15T19:52:30] haku: absolutely. thanks
[2025-02-15T19:53:18] haku: if i cant mount vescs without expensive custom cnc mounts this will be my next option
[2025-02-15T19:53:35] haku: gets up to 48c in the summer here
[2025-02-15T19:55:23] Smart Repair: 40*80mm https://a.aliexpress.com/_EHDDfQG
[2025-02-15T19:55:34] haku: thanks bro
[2025-02-15T19:55:55] haku: is it pretty heavy? with the water pump and radiator?
[2025-02-15T20:01:48] Smart Repair: I don't think so. I can tell you exactly in 1-2 weeks. about 300g liquid + 500g parts
[2025-02-15T20:02:38] haku: thats not too bad. thanks dude
[2025-02-15T20:03:15] haku: i thought a watercooled setup would be really heavy
[2025-02-15T20:03:58] haku: do you need a fan for the radiator too? or no need?
[2025-02-15T20:05:06] Smart Repair: Do you have a pulldown resistor on the signal line?
[2025-02-15T20:15:06] Smart Repair: ok, maybe a bit heavier. but under 1 kg. Pump 300g, liquid 300g, Radiator 100g, aluminum block 80g, expansion tank 120g + hoses/small material
[2025-02-15T20:17:16] Smart Repair: I will first test it with a small radiator without a fan. If that is not enough, I will add a larger radiator. I don't want to install a fan because it is a daily scooter.
[2025-02-15T20:20:01] haku: gotcha
[2025-02-15T20:27:21] ✨🇪🇸عمر: in the controller probably, but otherwise I haven't added any
[2025-02-15T20:28:59] Noname: @Bradhaku mount in the front forks. More speed more wind. Less speed less cooling needed
[2025-02-15T20:29:31] Smart Repair: add a 2k pull down
[2025-02-15T20:30:38] haku: what about when idle? stop and go traffic?
[2025-02-15T20:30:57] Noname: Your not using alot of power
[2025-02-15T20:31:06] Noname: Pushing snow back for more to come. Just did my whole front yard I was having fun 😁
[2025-02-15T20:31:09] haku: but burnouts
[2025-02-15T20:31:25] Smart Repair: so the plan
[2025-02-15T20:31:53] Noname: If there's a pump with tank you have enough time vs fluid volume
[2025-02-15T20:32:05] Smart Repair: for burnouts simply make the expansion tank larger 😅😅
[2025-02-15T20:34:54] Noname: I just found this on AliExpress: $51.49 | Syscooling bitcoin miner machine water cooling aluminum water block https://a.aliexpress.com/_msAdMYL
[2025-02-15T20:35:04] Noname: Something like this with bolt holes
[2025-02-15T20:37:40] haku: is this necessary in snowy places?
[2025-02-15T20:37:57] haku: cant you just wait for it to melt or pour water on it?
[2025-02-15T20:38:10] Noname: It melts and freezes on the driveway so less snow less ice and I was bored
[2025-02-15T20:38:38] haku: gotcha. alot of work in snowy climates.
[2025-02-15T20:38:42] Noname: Do you think my tractors sexy?
[2025-02-15T20:38:53] haku: absolutely
[2025-02-15T20:39:02] Noname: Songs don't lie
[2025-02-15T20:49:02] Smart Repair: In my case I don't need a big block. The Mosfet bank is 40x70mm
[2025-02-15T20:49:49] Smart Repair: I put the screws outside
[2025-02-15T21:29:50] haku: very nice. you what voltage are you doing on that setup?
[2025-02-15T21:30:17] haku: i always wonder about how to cool these x12s. how to mount cooling
[2025-02-15T21:48:29] Smart Repair: <photos/photo_21548@15-02-2025_21-48-29.jpg>
[2025-02-15T21:50:04] Smart Repair: For now I'll stick with 20s. Maybe later, when I have the time and inclination, I'll build a new battery. But then I'll have to replace the 250 ubox for the front 😭
[2025-02-15T22:02:54] haku: so you just put some capton tape on these parts here. the green kapton tape for pcb's?
[2025-02-15T22:03:22] haku: i wonder if the busses stick out as much as the fets
[2025-02-15T22:06:57] Smart Repair: I don't believe..
[2025-02-15T22:07:59] Smart Repair: kapton tape + coating like here
[2025-02-15T22:08:14] haku: i see gotcha
[2025-02-15T22:08:51] haku: thats easily removable if repairs needed? will it void warranty?
[2025-02-15T22:12:03] Smart Repair: is special circuit board varnish and can be soldered without removing it. It is unlikely that this will void the warranty.
[2025-02-15T22:12:17] haku: cool
[2025-02-15T22:12:45] haku: that a ubox logic yea?
[2025-02-15T22:13:00] haku: i need to do that too
[2025-02-15T22:13:17] haku: so somewhat waterproof
[2025-02-15T22:14:15] Smart Repair: yes, a 250. After an ESC broke after cleaning the scooter recently, I will now coat all the circuit boards including the BMS
[2025-02-15T22:14:34] haku: good idea
[2025-02-15T22:15:04] haku: i didnt know this can happen to logic boards
[2025-02-15T22:15:12] Smart Repair: After assembly, I will also seal all connectors waterproof. The GT is not waterproof and I want to have peace and quiet
[2025-02-15T22:15:59] Smart Repair: Buy a Segway GT and ride through the rain... then you know that it can happen 😅
[2025-02-15T22:16:53] haku: mines pretty bad too. no waterproofing at all
[2025-02-15T22:17:16] haku: are you in US?
[2025-02-15T22:17:44] Smart Repair: no, Germany
[2025-02-15T22:23:23] Lieven L.: Will be sufficient. Unless you use tiny tubing. For the radiator make sure you use an aluminum one if you're block is aluminum.
[2025-02-15T22:26:48] Lieven L.: Bigger Pumps don't really make much more sence unless you have a big loop with higher flow restrictions or if you want a very quiet setup. But I think a quiet Scooter isn't really a thing yet 😂
[2025-02-15T23:32:37] haku: i just got myself a leg pump. time to weld this badboy.
[2025-02-15T23:38:16] Noname: Safety glasses thank you
[2025-02-15T23:54:24] Smart Repair: interesting arrangement
[2025-02-16T00:06:54] haku: yea. first time doing this layout. but easy to cut
[2025-02-16T00:33:00] haku: i dont mistreat my dog boys. we and him just had a little misunderstanding. i forgive him for eating the apple pen.
[2025-02-16T00:44:46] Noname: Damn I got dog hair on me from watching this
[2025-02-16T00:45:52] haku: i apologiesed for calling him a heathen son of a dog
[2025-02-16T00:52:27] haku: my ali thermal paste arrived. its missing the needle dam
[2025-02-16T01:25:10] haku: is this jacket worth 150. moto jacket. i found in a garage sale
[2025-02-16T01:28:51] haku: they are asking 100 for this. i want it.
[2025-02-16T01:30:15] Noname: <photos/photo_21556@16-02-2025_01-30-15.jpg>
[2025-02-16T01:30:33] haku: what the shit. fucking scam
[2025-02-16T01:30:40] haku: they almost got me
[2025-02-16T01:31:34] haku: that one is leather yea?
[2025-02-16T01:32:01] Noname: Idk
[2025-02-16T01:32:28] haku: leather too hot anyway.
[2025-02-16T01:34:25] Noname: 275 retail on leather
[2025-02-16T01:35:06] haku: gotchta
[2025-02-16T01:36:20] haku: wearing full leather on a jetson bolt looks cool
[2025-02-16T01:37:32] Noname: I have a riding jacket send me 150$ its Alpinestar
[2025-02-16T01:38:39] Noname: Ooh 300$ weird mid drive e bike
[2025-02-16T01:39:44] haku: i would dam
[2025-02-16T01:40:04] haku: nvm thats just bmx frame
[2025-02-16T01:40:10] Noname: K leave the yardsale and find a jetson
[2025-02-16T01:54:47] haku: holy shit. they wilding out in the hood.
[2025-02-16T01:55:50] haku: fuck im not the king of the burnouts no more
[2025-02-16T02:09:37] haku: i just asked what is the special occassion of this free show. they said thier fellow motorcyclist died. RIP
[2025-02-16T02:10:07] haku: everyones burning rubber and doing runs up the street
[2025-02-16T02:12:18] haku: when i pass on a scooter gents. please do the same. please gather around my tomstone. i want streaming tears okay. i want someone to sing the national anthem. and everyone doing burnouts
[2025-02-16T02:12:18] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. haku has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-02-16T02:29:01] Noname: Not to be insensitive but I'd bet doing 150mph wheelie on the highway was the cause
[2025-02-16T02:30:33] haku: was that the cause
[2025-02-16T02:30:38] haku: lawd
[2025-02-16T02:30:46] Noname: I'm asking
[2025-02-16T02:31:01] haku: maybe. he did pass in the highway
[2025-02-16T02:31:52] haku: it was alot of motos. and alot of sorrow in this gathering seems like
[2025-02-16T05:27:52] Rose: Hey there Cristian, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-02-16T13:17:35] Lieven L.: Jacket: Speed +100mph Sunglasses: Coolness +50 Shoes: Safty -1000 Dog: Cuteness +50
[2025-02-16T14:43:58] Rose: Hey there Antonio, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-02-16T17:16:41] haku: crocs is ventilation

[2025-02-16T22:15:00] haku: what is this?
[2025-02-16T22:29:41] haku: need a working scooter or bike asap. peak riding season
[2025-02-16T22:41:15] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: are the errors according to how many beeps
[2025-02-16T22:59:38] Eren: Ik the controller is broken
[2025-02-17T00:11:30] Matte: any concensus regarding vesc traction control? Good, bad, stay away?
[2025-02-17T00:15:53] JPPL: Its ok, you Will Loose torque, prevent much spining
[2025-02-17T00:16:10] JPPL: ONLY need to BE activated on master
[2025-02-17T00:33:47] Finn: My own experience with Traction control is that i cant turn it off. Else i need to buy new tires every day. No traction at the front at all even when i lean forward.
[2025-02-17T01:10:13] 'lekrsu': It's awesome. Benefits rule out the downsides. Very seamless.

[2025-02-17T03:04:14] haku: who wants to place a bid on my latest art piece?
[2025-02-17T03:04:45] haku: is that a laotie. whats that sound
[2025-02-17T04:53:54] Matthew: Is that in a 125mm dropout?
[2025-02-17T04:59:25] Matthew: I do believe there's a material that's more robust than leather and is used on riding jackets... but like most things.... I'm probably wrong
[2025-02-17T04:59:46] haku: kevlar maybe
[2025-02-17T05:00:09] haku: those are super expensive. stuff that batman wears
[2025-02-17T05:14:03] Matthew: Yeah man. Real protection is expensive... but it's honestly 1000% necessary. I wrecked multiple times and only thing I've dealt with is being sore and really embarrassed that I've wrecked and get back up and keep going..
[2025-02-17T05:32:58] haku: agreed
[2025-02-17T05:41:29] haku: dont mind the black spot. its just spilled ink okay.
[2025-02-17T10:38:57] Smart Repair: does not work with different motors that do not have the same number of poles
[2025-02-17T11:53:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also have to be sensored
[2025-02-17T12:00:04] Finn: Traction control needs hall sensors?
[2025-02-17T12:00:25] Smart Repair: I couldn't get the traction control to work. That's one of the reasons why I'm going to replace the front stock motor with a lonnyo
[2025-02-17T12:00:49] Mirono escooters: I thought backemf was enough
[2025-02-17T12:00:56] Finn: Yeah it is
[2025-02-17T12:01:08] Finn: Else it wouldnt work on my sensorless scooter
[2025-02-17T12:04:07] Mirono escooters: That's solved then
[2025-02-17T12:14:58] GABE: Want to avoid using fwk in general imo
[2025-02-17T12:15:11] GABE: If you want record breaking just go 32s and 33/2
[2025-02-17T12:15:22] GABE: asking for issues
[2025-02-17T12:22:24] Jan: There are no 10inch motors for over 160kmh
[2025-02-17T12:22:47] GABE: Ah so only 11+" rim is capable
[2025-02-17T12:22:57] GABE: must be more copper mass.
[2025-02-17T12:22:59] Jan: Lonnyo is only partially feasable. The precision on the motor is terrible, its all sand cast
[2025-02-17T12:23:11] GABE: I noticed.
[2025-02-17T12:23:17] GABE: Best not to even open those
[2025-02-17T12:23:23] Jan: You will have wobbles and the phase cables are too small
[2025-02-17T12:23:32] GABE: I have the 11inch
[2025-02-17T12:23:56] GABE: Wouldnt recommend opening them. But the phase wires are as much kw as you need
[2025-02-17T12:23:57] Jan: Ill do my own motors this year when the project is finished
[2025-02-17T12:24:01] GABE: So you don't have to open them ever
[2025-02-17T12:26:49] GABE: I just use sensor less all the time atp
[2025-02-17T12:27:08] GABE: Just can't go less than 20kmh or it clonks up. So you have to sacrifice cruising.
[2025-02-17T12:30:09] 'lekrsu': They don't need hall sensors, as you're by default not even using them at higher speeds.
[2025-02-17T12:46:03] GABE: A few kicks to 20 is nothing but stop lights are a tad of a pain It works like a car clutch kinda Can't let people drive it or they let the motor clonk up. I've done burnouts Infront of my uni and people asked to try and I forgot it's sensorless they also can't grasp the fact the accel sensor is super sensitive
[2025-02-17T12:46:11] GABE: I also kick it while accelerating
[2025-02-17T12:46:20] GABE: it makes accel like +300%
[2025-02-17T12:46:25] GABE: Unironically
[2025-02-17T13:53:01] GABE: Slow
[2025-02-17T13:53:01] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-02-17T15:57:00] Lieven L.: Well dand casting isn't bad by default. But they don't seem to balance the motors. CNCed motors would be somewhat overkill. I don't think many people would be able to afford them.
[2025-02-17T16:00:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: How necessary is sensors in vescs (I'm talking especially about acceleration ) because wolf thunder and a lot more high powered scooters come sensorless
[2025-02-17T16:03:36] Jan: Lonnyo will do the bare minimum as long as people are not buying better more expensive products. They will just adapt to the market needs. They are not pioneers
[2025-02-17T16:06:12] 'lekrsu': As said, nobody is using hall sensors except for very low RPM here, unless manually configured to have them permanently active.
[2025-02-17T16:06:47] Lieven L.: Yeah. I'd like to see some axial flux motors. Should allow for a lot more power. But requires higher tolerances.
[2025-02-17T16:06:50] 'lekrsu': We're talking sub 10 km/h range, where sensorless has some slight stutter, which can be medicated by signals and almost ruled out.
[2025-02-17T16:06:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Expound?
[2025-02-17T16:07:12] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Kick to start ?
[2025-02-17T16:07:34] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like it will not accelerate from 0 so no real drag races
[2025-02-17T16:08:13] 'lekrsu': It can accelerate from zero as well.
[2025-02-17T16:08:21] 'lekrsu': <photos/photo_21562@17-02-2025_16-08-21.jpg>
[2025-02-17T16:09:26] 'lekrsu': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-6qzmeCNtw
[2025-02-17T16:12:22] 'lekrsu': If you go sensorless start at zero speed without any of the additional configuration that is possible, then it'll spam high current until it generates enough bemf to track your position with the observer.
[2025-02-17T16:24:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Look Al of this looks complicated to me I prefer to get my motors sensored and that it All I know that when I tried dual sensorless on my 84100 makerbase the vescs went crazy
[2025-02-17T16:25:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: However when I was only front sensorless it was okish
[2025-02-17T16:29:13] Rose: Hey there Rasolzada, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-02-17T17:24:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Can I use this as a heatsink?
[2025-02-17T17:25:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <animation>
[2025-02-17T17:33:23] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Without the electronics off course
[2025-02-17T18:05:48] haku: if its aluminum sure.
[2025-02-17T18:06:07] haku: but why not get one with fins
[2025-02-17T18:10:29] haku: i use halls. big ball halls is what they call me
[2025-02-17T18:11:32] Noname: I don't or shut them down at low speed. They call me no halls all balls
[2025-02-17T18:12:21] puneDir: No
[2025-02-17T18:35:11] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): And the 11" is just "summer" motors ... stay far far far away from any drop of water 🤣
[2025-02-17T18:39:32] Jan: Solution would be custom motors 🤷
[2025-02-17T18:39:38] Jan: Lots of dev time again
[2025-02-17T19:32:25] Rose: Hey there ❤️, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2025-02-17T20:16:41] 'lekrsu': -78W? :)
[2025-02-17T20:25:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Don't know ask him
[2025-02-17T20:25:53] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But if he got 110 on 18s wonder how fast I'll get with 20s
[2025-02-17T22:05:03] haku: you cannot fool these cops lmao. https://youtu.be/SafLJbIQrAA?si=9ltewizcMlLuTSA6
[2025-02-17T22:09:13] Eren: Taking it on its last ride before selling
[2025-02-17T22:18:43] NetworkDir: Regen (Brake)
[2025-02-17T22:19:15] 'lekrsu': Just fun seeing 300A numbers but the RT showing negatives
[2025-02-17T22:19:17] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2025-02-17T22:38:32] haku: back pain is temporary. swole is forever!
[2025-02-17T22:59:00] haku: dam my son accedentally hit my head with a stick. it hurts like hell but i cant show weakness infront of him. i wanted to cry fuck
[2025-02-17T23:03:28] Yamal: be careful cowboy
[2025-02-17T23:07:29] haku: where did you go yamal!
[2025-02-17T23:10:10] Yamal: nowhere man! busy you know with daily work, housework, time to rest and relax and sailing in a sea full of vesc controllers, motors, high discharge cells, chassis types :)
[2025-02-17T23:11:54] Yamal: I am also trying to find an international school for my little daughter for the year she is coming to see if she can enter one where 95% of English is spoken to facilitate her integration and make her more comfortable.
[2025-02-17T23:12:27] Yamal: difficult task in my city..
[2025-02-17T23:12:35] haku: good man. english pretty easy to learn.
[2025-02-17T23:13:09] haku: hows the new project? any updates
[2025-02-17T23:13:25] Yamal: he problem is that she only speaks English, I didn't worry about teaching her Spanish when she was younger.
[2025-02-17T23:13:36] Yamal: Nop.. no money man
[2025-02-17T23:13:56] haku: same.
[2025-02-17T23:14:23] haku: well im excited for you brother! when that badboy hits the streets/circuit

[2025-02-17T23:15:19] haku: fitment in the chasis
[2025-02-17T23:15:52] Yamal: The nami needs some maintenance, and I'm considering transferring everything to the new chassis with the new engines but I don't know yet.
[2025-02-17T23:16:35] haku: thats actually a great idea. and see how it rides compared to nami
[2025-02-17T23:17:53] Yamal: he RFP chassis has countless positive things about everything, but Nami's chassis has me eternally captivated!
[2025-02-17T23:18:11] haku: nami still better looking imo

[2025-02-18T00:48:02] Noname: Buy and put a vsett 11 forks on it
[2025-02-18T01:45:44] haku: this is the highway legend yea?
[2025-02-18T01:46:02] haku: is this that same dude?
[2025-02-18T01:50:12] haku: nice
[2025-02-18T02:10:49] haku: electric hummer. gay af.
[2025-02-18T02:12:28] haku: this will never compete head to head with the legendary cybertruck
[2025-02-18T02:28:45] Noname: What how. Cybertruck is such a nerd vehicle
[2025-02-18T02:29:13] haku: what are you talking about. thats a chad vehicle
[2025-02-18T02:29:23] Noname: Like an Aztec knocked up a DeLorean
[2025-02-18T02:29:56] haku: its a symbolic truck. its the first of its kind
[2025-02-18T02:29:59] Noname: I'd rather the Chad mobile. People be laughing at me for being a Chad not a tesla owner
[2025-02-18T02:30:11] Noname: Hopefully last
[2025-02-18T02:30:31] Noname: But both can burn in hell honestly
[2025-02-18T02:31:16] haku: yes. ev trucks is dumb as shit i agree
[2025-02-18T02:32:03] haku: but the name tesla will always be legendary
[2025-02-18T02:33:06] haku: i doubt this. i see so many here now.
[2025-02-18T02:34:10] Noname: There's one here, everyone points and laughs at it
[2025-02-18T02:35:16] haku: maybe tucker carlsons. he lives by that area
[2025-02-18T04:09:52] Rose: Hey there Branch, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-02-18T04:33:07] haku: good morning vesc chat!
[2025-02-18T06:47:49] Yamal: Superchat
[2025-02-18T08:10:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And the top speed was 100+ on 18s?
[2025-02-18T09:56:08] KierreKikkeli: <video_file>
[2025-02-18T09:56:22] KierreKikkeli: What is this god forbidden behaviour and how do i fix it?
[2025-02-18T09:58:42] KierreKikkeli: the vesc and adc v2 detect the input correctly, however when pulling the brake lever 85% in it disengages the break and while hovering on the brink of on off (on button blinking) it starts doing all kinds of weird crap as in trembling and such while sometimes it just tries to go forward?
[2025-02-18T09:59:30] KierreKikkeli: anyone have any clue on whats going on? Also randomly turns on and off without a pattern or any damage to the wires or wiring?
[2025-02-18T10:06:00] 'lekrsu': Is it just normal 3.3v/gnd to adc2 and the button is wired to what?
[2025-02-18T10:12:52] francois schempers: can we see the input wizard and the range of adc's while you brake and accelerate ?
[2025-02-18T11:49:13] KierreKikkeli: basic adc v2 wiring with stock xiaomi brake and throttle

[2025-02-18T11:56:06] Smart Repair: Can you make a short video showing the input?
[2025-02-18T11:56:12] KierreKikkeli: the ranges have always been wack, even tho im just running signal wire to xiaomi headers
[2025-02-18T11:56:41] KierreKikkeli: as in when it does the weirdness or just the values?
[2025-02-18T11:56:53] Smart Repair: What position is the small switch on the ADC module in?
[2025-02-18T11:58:02] KierreKikkeli: no clue, havent touched it since i installed it a year ago or so and it worked then
[2025-02-18T11:58:02] Smart Repair: ADC mapping and then apply the brake a few times and hold it briefly when the problem occurs
[2025-02-18T12:00:38] JPPL: <video_file>
[2025-02-18T12:00:38] JPPL: 2 years memory
[2025-02-18T12:00:42] Smart Repair: why inverted? I would remove the hook and recalibrate ADC
[2025-02-18T12:01:37] KierreKikkeli: <video_file>
[2025-02-18T12:02:30] KierreKikkeli: was scouring some forums of ppl who had a similiar issue and it was advised to test the inverted, also what hook? And by recalibrating you mean the controller setup?
[2025-02-18T12:02:39] KierreKikkeli: didnt really do anything
[2025-02-18T12:05:24] Smart Repair: I wrote you a PM
[2025-02-18T14:50:05] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 70 to be exect
[2025-02-18T15:26:11] Marius: 😱😱👍
[2025-02-18T15:43:57] Jason: I wanna fkn seal the motor with silicone
[2025-02-18T15:43:59] Jason: mmmm
[2025-02-18T15:57:17] haku: tell me more about this build
[2025-02-18T16:23:26] Face de Pin Sucé: Discover in exclusivity the first 100H motor from RAGE MECHANICS ❤️ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Vx4KrizSM0&ab_channel=RageMechanicsEngineering
[2025-02-18T16:25:57] Jan: It sounds so accent free to me, i can basically understand 100%, or im used to toulouse accent and you are from that area? 😅
[2025-02-18T16:35:22] Face de Pin Sucé: I'm from Lyon x)
[2025-02-18T16:57:24] haku: bonjour. have you tested these yet?
[2025-02-18T16:58:06] Face de Pin Sucé: Tonight I test on bench to see the speed
[2025-02-18T17:01:39] haku: i wonder if it runs cooler than the 70h
[2025-02-18T17:05:30] Yamal: 200kmh let’s goo
[2025-02-18T17:05:44] haku: 200h lets go
[2025-02-18T17:06:27] haku: motors getting wider but stators size stay the same why is that?
[2025-02-18T17:06:49] Yamal: Who is electric fox?
[2025-02-18T17:07:35] Yamal: He say I use his picture
[2025-02-18T17:08:21] haku: he is a vesc enthusiast
[2025-02-18T17:08:34] haku: many trampa projects
[2025-02-18T17:08:49] Yamal: Maybe he know Ben
[2025-02-18T17:09:02] haku: i dont know him personally but ive seen some of his builds
[2025-02-18T17:09:23] haku: maybe yes
[2025-02-18T17:10:52] haku: maybe @jamessoderstrom know him personally im not sure. they hail from the same region of the world
[2025-02-18T17:12:05] haku: you have my permission to use my personal builds ;). on your videos
[2025-02-18T17:12:36] Yamal: I don't know but I like the song in that video
[2025-02-18T17:12:54] haku: link video

[2025-02-18T17:15:32] Yamal: When he tells me what images they are, I delete them and that's it, but that is the most important video on the channel
[2025-02-18T17:15:36] Yamal: xD
[2025-02-18T17:17:54] haku: just an elitist dork. this video is good showcase of vesc options
[2025-02-18T17:18:42] haku: ask him wich photos are his
[2025-02-18T17:18:54] haku: he shouldve put a watermark
[2025-02-18T17:30:39] Face de Pin Sucé: He does
[2025-02-18T17:31:00] haku: he is elite then
[2025-02-18T18:23:14] haku: you removed the video dam
[2025-02-18T18:24:07] haku: how is america going to know about vesc but thru yamals videos
[2025-02-18T18:25:18] Smart Repair: you can share the video here?
[2025-02-18T19:32:10] Yamal: I will make another one for later
[2025-02-18T19:49:01] haku: lawd so long video. just check IR and open if serial number checks out.

[2025-02-18T22:28:48] Yamal: Why not
[2025-02-18T22:30:16] haku: i agree. a hero needs to do it. he is here. i might be talking to him at this very moment
[2025-02-18T22:32:05] Yamal: The hero here is called Benjamin Vedder, and he is still missing. Perhaps he will hear some rumor about a channel called "Vesc project paradise"
[2025-02-18T22:32:41] Yamal: If this happens, the curtain rises.
[2025-02-18T22:34:13] haku: perhaps. legend has it there was a man who escaped a well looking prison. and became an excomunicated member of raz agul. then he tried to bring order to gotham.
[2025-02-18T22:35:56] Yamal: speechless! you are number one in curling the curl. thanks
[2025-02-18T22:59:58] haku: lets not stand on ceremony here. mr. wayne
[2025-02-18T23:11:26] Yamal: https://youtu.be/T__7oDAJdxE?si=ywRr_t7JjjyeFXbD
[2025-02-18T23:11:32] Yamal: Nice song xD
[2025-02-18T23:12:01] Yamal: ￼😂
[2025-02-18T23:13:59] Yamal: They say: "find yourself a girlfriend who knows how to cook and iron" and who can raise children, what does it matter what they think?xD
[2025-02-18T23:22:43] haku: i cook and carry iron to protect my child. thats all that matters in the end my boy. someone to continue your bloodline
[2025-02-18T23:24:07] haku: the children needs protection from these heathens. a woman has softer hearts than men. -geoffrey from game of thrones
[2025-02-19T00:31:27] Face de Pin Sucé: Nope sorry
[2025-02-19T00:40:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I have now if you want
[2025-02-19T00:59:30] haku: look at this new land cruiser. this looks cool af
[2025-02-19T01:27:43] haku: drag races in the hood is our lifestyle. my boy race for pinks.
[2025-02-19T01:55:35] Matthew: What does q-axis current factor do? Mine is set 2%.
[2025-02-19T02:00:16] Matthew: I did what grin tech said and used a very thin drill bit just wide enough to fit the syringe to push the statorade into it. Then I sealed the motor back up with a bit of non shrinking silicone. My 65h motor is sealed for sure... but I don't know if lonnyo always seals them or not.
[2025-02-19T04:44:53] Matthew: My family hates decisions my brothers and I chose. Zero kids and the 3 of us are the only boys to carry the Garcia name. They've faced the fact of it a good while back when I said I'm getting a vasectomy that no grandkids will be coming. I'm 41 and my brothers are 37 and 30
[2025-02-19T04:46:21] haku: all good dude. im sure you have other relatives that can continue it. for me im the literally the last one
[2025-02-19T04:47:58] haku: and ex wife wants to raise my son like a little bitch. to hell with that. im raising a man
[2025-02-19T04:48:35] Matthew: World is crazy. We need to go back to a more mellow era but keep modern medicine haha. My father would have to have more children and he is 74yrs old and stepmother is 62... my mother had tubes tide when she had my 37yrs brother
[2025-02-19T04:49:48] Matthew: Dude. I am bi, but ain't no bitch. I work with a dude that just has sisters... he's basically a straight girl lol(guy and not gay)
[2025-02-19T04:50:32] haku: right now my boy is grounded and needs to learn consiquences. he threw a white board eraser at a girl. maybe his crush im not sure yet.
[2025-02-19T04:50:44] haku: 🤣
[2025-02-19T04:51:40] haku: no electronics and treats exept ebikes
[2025-02-19T04:51:50] Matthew: Hahaha. Yeah, that's honestly a huge problem with today's kids growing up. Most parents these days are stuck in their phone and don't do anything about raising a child that has manners, respect and integrity
[2025-02-19T04:52:37] haku: i agree 100% no hands on with thier children seems like
[2025-02-19T04:53:32] haku: also internet plays a big role in todays youth/children
[2025-02-19T04:53:47] haku: i limit that for my boy.
[2025-02-19T04:54:11] haku: back in the day we had to go outside to get entertained
[2025-02-19T04:59:20] Matthew: I feel that internet and gaming is extremely toxic for younger individuals if things are not kept in check. My best friends basically family had 5 boys. Now that they're sophomore and junior they are fine to play in the evening if homework is done. But when they were younger she made them go outside to fun. The choice was go out and have fun with all the neighborhood kids or stay in the home and start cleaning haha.
[2025-02-19T05:00:38] Matthew: I see a lot of people talk crazy to others. Like they've never been punched in the face. When you attack them is when they finally realize "i fucked up"
[2025-02-19T05:01:30] haku: yea. i balance it all out. he likes minecraft and since thats a kinda smart game i encourage him. also alot of time outside on bikes and other kids is important
[2025-02-19T05:02:03] Matthew: I've had my own road rage on these scooters but it is only when the driver threatens to hit me. I go after them with a steel baton and they don't know what to do.
[2025-02-19T05:03:04] haku: becareful out there bro. we always have to watch out for crazy drivers. lots and lots here
[2025-02-19T05:04:04] Matthew: I know.... I am careful as can be and follow the laws. I got ran over by a truck last year around this time.
[2025-02-19T05:05:38] haku: tbh this is why i dont ride in the street at night here. not the best city to bike or scoot.
[2025-02-19T05:05:53] Matthew: Sadly seen someone I am pretty sure died shortly after getting hit by someone going over 50mph. Dude was doing cartwheels in the air. He hit the ground and moved a little bit and then didn't move anymore and a puddle of blood was coming out under him.... and the car that hit him.. ran and did not come back
[2025-02-19T05:06:25] haku: dam. rip
[2025-02-19T05:06:44] haku: thats sad to hear. no chance vs cars
[2025-02-19T05:06:58] Matthew: I try to stick to canal trails if possible. People think they're the only person on the street and forget they're in a 4000lbs weapon
[2025-02-19T05:07:44] haku: thats the problem too in vegas. public transportation sucks. busses always late
[2025-02-19T05:08:06] Matthew: Yeah man, really sad. We were all so confused. Like where did that fuck go. I really hope there was survalence cams at the light and find the murderer
[2025-02-19T05:08:18] haku: people use pevs to go to work but they have to ride safely
[2025-02-19T05:09:19] haku: if i ever get hit by any idiot they better end me or ill have all the money to buy all the surrons
[2025-02-19T05:09:31] haku: after suing ofcourse
[2025-02-19T05:09:40] Matthew: Hell, our busses sometimes don't even show up. Or if they're running early, they don't stop and abide by the schedule. It's dumb. When I was in Germany working If I'm not mistaken every 15 minutes a bus was coming
[2025-02-19T05:10:49] Matthew: Yeah, my only transportation is my scooters or bus or uber.
[2025-02-19T05:11:10] Matthew: Uber has a $200 monthly budget as if I have a car payment
[2025-02-19T05:22:51] haku: if it was just up to me i would do the same. so convinient in the city pevs. i just cant take my boy to school on a bike or scooter. his school is far.
[2025-02-19T06:15:46] Noname: How far
[2025-02-19T09:32:28] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes if you want to share ☺️
[2025-02-19T10:10:14] Smart Repair: the 70H are definitely 0.00% sealed. and the bearings are also rubbish. I can only recommend that everyone replace the bearings before assembly and seal everything properly

[2025-02-19T10:42:06] Jason: <photos/photo_21578@19-02-2025_10-42-06.jpg>
[2025-02-19T10:42:13] Jason: solves water issue 😁
[2025-02-19T11:04:04] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): For applications like battery you maybe better use Plasti Dip. Much easier to remove and can be sprayed on controllers.
[2025-02-19T11:08:04] Jason: I wish i could find smth similar like that here
[2025-02-19T11:08:10] Jason: 😇
[2025-02-19T11:13:05] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Here you go ..... https://global.gmarket.co.kr/item?goodscode=294389102
[2025-02-19T11:14:58] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Just ordered my bottle (in Germany) as i noticed my black one dried out after 2 years :) ...... Well it was cheap (6 euro) so who cares the color 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2025-02-19T11:14:59] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-02-19T11:29:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Then answer me in dm ahahaha
[2025-02-19T11:34:02] GABE: Banning electric is like banning home cooking lol.
[2025-02-19T11:34:08] GABE: Anyone can make it
[2025-02-19T11:45:20] Rose: Hey there yellowelep, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-02-19T11:49:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Shit work. But if u drive only in summer u can seal only from outside motor. Also replacing the bearings on phase side will be headache
[2025-02-19T12:02:53] Smart Repair: I don't understand why loonyo doesn't install a shaft seal on the phase side. There is one on the other side, so the bearing there was intact.
[2025-02-19T12:14:46] Jan: Because its cheaper
[2025-02-19T14:17:11] Yamal: Not driving when it's raining is cheap in the end too
[2025-02-19T14:19:37] Jan: I agree but lonnyo doesnt, that means people are not willing to pay extra for it or havent asked
[2025-02-19T14:21:19] Yamal: Maybe it is possible to speak with the factory and ask for the sealed water pumps before buying them, if not, do it yourself at home.
[2025-02-19T16:46:17] haku: no idea but next hood over maybe 5 miles
[2025-02-19T16:47:04] haku: regulations and taxations on government roads man.
[2025-02-19T17:01:41] Matte: Jelly of these scooter bodies that open from top. Mine is just alu extrusion tube
[2025-02-19T17:08:59] Noname: Get a trailer and pull him with wepoor
[2025-02-19T18:21:11] haku: i had that. not the safest
[2025-02-19T18:21:40] Noname: Ok finish grandma trike as a 2 seater
[2025-02-19T20:48:58] haku: senior @jamaludin_algarnati any updates

[2025-02-19T20:59:22] Yamal: after being fighting with Customs since Thursday of last week
[2025-02-19T20:59:45] haku: why customs put it on hold?
[2025-02-19T21:00:45] Yamal: The typical thing is to attach an invoice, payment method, verify that the price corresponds to the invoice, etc.
[2025-02-19T21:02:36] haku: dam. complicated stuff
[2025-02-19T21:02:50] haku: you pay taxes there?
[2025-02-19T21:05:05] Yamal: I need to pay now ,online or tomorrow when they come
[2025-02-19T21:05:33] haku: lawd taxations for the malaysians
[2025-02-19T21:05:56] Yamal: Malaysians? ^^'
[2025-02-19T21:06:09] haku: it rhymes with taxations.
[2025-02-19T21:07:25] haku: rumor has it. we getting a $5k tax bonus ive heard from cutting some other spendings

[2025-02-19T21:19:06] GABE: You only need one male hamster to breed 1000 :D
[2025-02-19T21:19:32] Yamal: I don't understand you, you're about to receive a large amount of money, you say?
[2025-02-19T21:19:33] haku: whoa. no need for females?
[2025-02-19T21:19:35] GABE: give him a week
[2025-02-19T21:19:42] GABE: put one male in a box of 1000

[2025-02-19T21:20:05] haku: not me all american taxpayers.
[2025-02-19T21:20:14] haku: rumor has it
[2025-02-19T21:21:16] haku: just curious. can male hamsters refuse to breed?
[2025-02-19T21:21:51] Yamal: No
[2025-02-19T21:21:54] GABE: LOL
[2025-02-19T21:21:55] GABE: No
[2025-02-19T21:22:01] GABE: even yamal says no
[2025-02-19T21:22:04] haku: ok gotcha. thats good news
[2025-02-19T21:23:09] Yamal: they are animals
[2025-02-19T21:23:10] GABE: Put one man into a vault with 1000 women and see what happens. that happened in the fallout lore by the way
[2025-02-19T21:23:19] GABE: Vault 23 Iirc
[2025-02-19T21:23:19] haku: that be buissness model. hamsters and batteries. just like yamaha. motorcycle and pianos. makes no sense
[2025-02-19T21:23:29] GABE: us too.
[2025-02-19T21:26:20] haku: well lets not get too deep in the rabbit hole.
[2025-02-19T21:27:13] Yamal: I'm not going to get into this topic. I'm not going to say that eggs are the menstruation of chickens or honey is the vomit of bees, it's not my style!
[2025-02-19T21:27:31] haku: im just curious of hamster sexuality is all. if the males refuse to breed. and choose other males. what should i do?
[2025-02-19T21:27:44] GABE: They'll breed whats available
[2025-02-19T21:29:46] haku: can you cross breed a hamster with a mouse?
[2025-02-19T21:30:16] haku: i might do the unthinkable horror experiments.
[2025-02-19T21:31:18] haku: maybe a miniature hamster sized samoyed
[2025-02-19T21:52:33] Yamal: https://youtu.be/wZEdwyNtvUA?si=bIGUUxrxwJG0eJSo
[2025-02-19T22:13:05] Matthew: How good is results? I have my handlebar id like to coat because the manufacturer of it just spray painted it and the paint flakes off in chunks 😭
[2025-02-19T22:15:07] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_21581@19-02-2025_22-15-07.jpg>
[2025-02-19T22:15:31] Mirono escooters: Any things I should know about the pro v2.0? I see they added phase filters and build quality seems ok PS: how do you wire PAS to vesc?
[2025-02-20T00:12:30] Yamal: <photos/photo_21582@20-02-2025_00-12-30.jpg>
[2025-02-20T00:13:38] haku: oh yea. those squares are the suspension blocks yea?
[2025-02-20T00:30:01] Yamal: Dt suspension
[2025-02-20T00:38:35] haku: is it better than spring. compare to nami when build is done
[2025-02-20T03:38:50] haku: challenged accepted. where is this. wepoor needs a comparisson. https://youtube.com/shorts/sx9YUJNkbzo?si=XG2Mo8E_urb_UKaS
[2025-02-20T03:47:18] haku: no idea lmao
[2025-02-20T03:47:30] haku: its a k6 bull race
[2025-02-20T03:49:11] haku: thats americas best looks like. im sorry gents this is the best we can do
[2025-02-20T04:03:41] haku: pain is the best teacher boys. always remember. https://youtube.com/shorts/8sJxJClpodg?si=kuPSdpOHnh3A4bin
[2025-02-20T05:14:29] Noname: It's the steering. Fighting a hard corner and what feels like square tires.
[2025-02-20T05:25:22] Matthew: Looks like me trying to take corner on my yume y11 that has the off-road tires on. But I drive on the streets and the wear patch in the middle has basically turned the tire into a square. It's fricken horrible. I have some different 11" hybrids i want to put on but I can't even get the brake rotor off. There's a screw stuck. And surprisingly I didn't strip that allen threads.... the little screw literally bent my allen wrench. So I just put all the other screws back on and decided it's gonna be a bicycle shop issue soon 🤫😵
[2025-02-20T05:26:53] haku: steering on these things is bad?
[2025-02-20T05:27:09] Noname: Yup and the tires are way to wide
[2025-02-20T05:29:59] Noname: Use heat they have locktite.
[2025-02-20T05:33:36] Noname: I would race with my friend at night on the twisty bike paths. I can absolutely murder him in turns with the vsett 11 but I can't get around his fat ass on a 3' wide path lol
[2025-02-20T05:34:11] Noname: Although on the straights k6 is fast AF
[2025-02-20T05:35:40] haku: i bet its 30s isnt it?
[2025-02-20T05:36:35] Noname: Yeah. With the power of Vesc I can almost keep up but 16s vs 30s is a challenge
[2025-02-20T05:37:30] haku: i need to find someone in town. and see for myself. good challenge for wepoor
[2025-02-20T05:37:32] Noname: 20s and I got him but he also weighs a lot so be prepared to race a k6
[2025-02-20T05:38:01] haku: i always wondered about this k6
[2025-02-20T05:38:03] Noname: I'd imagine you'd win easily
[2025-02-20T05:38:43] haku: no idea. i havent seen one but that thing can do rolling burnouts wich is cool
[2025-02-20T05:38:50] haku: winding prolly 22x3
[2025-02-20T05:39:00] Noname: Front tire spins because your sitting on the back one 😆
[2025-02-20T05:39:11] haku: oh makes sense
[2025-02-20T05:45:47] haku: what happened here
[2025-02-20T05:47:16] haku: lmao
[2025-02-20T05:48:03] haku: no chance they can chase you on foot lmao
[2025-02-20T05:49:23] Matthew: Lmaoooooo
[2025-02-20T05:51:00] haku: thats just a regular street. why would they even pull you over. wtf.
[2025-02-20T05:53:00] haku: lmao. these cops have nothing better to do. jeez
[2025-02-20T05:54:53] Matthew: I've heard it's hit and miss with flipsky. Total miss on the one i had... flipsky found out their unit was bad AND fried 2 motors of mine. When they knew their product was bad I got ghosted... that was pretty much a year ago from now....
[2025-02-20T05:56:57] Matthew: They don't want to try and fight real crime. They'd rather nickel and dime you to death for state revenue.

[2025-02-20T06:23:23] Noname: Great chocolate but gets arrested for breathing
[2025-02-20T06:23:28] haku: well go there for the culture and history
[2025-02-20T06:23:50] Noname: I'm an uncultured asshole and I hate people
[2025-02-20T06:24:29] haku: europe such an old continent. so much history
[2025-02-20T06:25:34] haku: i always watch historical stuff about it. yea thats my thing
[2025-02-20T07:15:42] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): It's like a thin latex layer so not suited for handlebar
[2025-02-20T07:43:50] Patrick: Yes the big LY once arent recommended for rain
[2025-02-20T09:27:52] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I recommend. and use the scooter in water☺️
[2025-02-20T09:31:31] Mirono escooters: I didn't buy it, just have to help someone. Already flashed better firmware, not much more I can do
[2025-02-20T09:31:38] Mirono escooters: They got phase filters It seems

[2025-02-20T11:11:48] Hackintoshhhh: 1 time rain and bearings go to shit
[2025-02-20T11:12:09] Hackintoshhhh: Have a friend also on ly 65h bearings sound like a rattlecan
[2025-02-20T11:12:28] Hackintoshhhh: 240
[2025-02-20T11:20:23] Jason: damn
[2025-02-20T11:35:52] Patrick: Yea the bearings arent rated good for outdoor use anyways
[2025-02-20T11:36:19] Hackintoshhhh: Wtf are they rated for then
[2025-02-20T11:36:26] Patrick: They have like 1 star from 5 regarding weather resistance on the 1 side
[2025-02-20T11:36:27] Hackintoshhhh: Am i supposed to drive it in my corridor?
[2025-02-20T11:37:12] Hackintoshhhh: When i was 13s 350w these motors looked like the world to me
[2025-02-20T11:37:21] Hackintoshhhh: Now i hate almost everything about them
[2025-02-20T11:37:37] Patrick: Yea not good quality
[2025-02-20T11:37:40] Patrick: But best for this price
[2025-02-20T11:37:50] Eren: This 30y old does not wanna run
[2025-02-20T11:38:13] Hackintoshhhh: They should hit the ppl making the motors more
[2025-02-20T11:38:22] Hackintoshhhh: Then they would be better
[2025-02-20T11:51:48] Jason: check carb
[2025-02-20T12:00:08] Eren: Its clean i think its spark plug
[2025-02-20T12:46:52] GABE: guaranteed they'll try do it.
[2025-02-20T12:54:01] Jason: see if it sparks
[2025-02-20T12:54:14] Jason: pull it out plug it into the lead and see
[2025-02-20T13:08:30] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): One reason i wont buy a LY motor ..... if they just make them a bit better (More waterproof, better bearings) it would be an instant buy.
[2025-02-20T13:19:32] Patrick: You could make them waterproof new bearings & Lots of silicone cause of the bad tolerances
[2025-02-20T13:24:58] Jan: Well.made billet cnc housing is already 200$ alone. If people people are not ready to drop 500-600$ per good quality motor, nobody will.make one
[2025-02-20T13:38:45] haku: hawt dawg! 80h
[2025-02-20T13:39:10] haku: senior bolas grandes indeed

[2025-02-20T13:41:51] haku: agreed!
[2025-02-20T13:42:28] Yamal: I thought they were going to be bigger but they are super compact
[2025-02-20T13:42:29] haku: ok back to sleep for me!
[2025-02-20T13:43:01] haku: fitmemt later. okay need to go back to bed
[2025-02-20T13:44:43] Smart Repair: Yes, Abs
[2025-02-20T14:15:25] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Keep in mind there people that have access only to lonnyo motors/AliExpress
[2025-02-20T14:36:08] Jan: There arent really any other brands for scooters i know of except huameng
[2025-02-20T14:36:31] Smart Repair: what is a good alternative under 1000€
[2025-02-20T14:37:20] Jan: There is none to my understanding of the market, thats the problem
[2025-02-20T14:38:18] Jan: Technically Bosch does but its B2B only as far as i know
[2025-02-20T14:59:51] GABE: imagine this converted to a 700hp electric
[2025-02-20T15:03:10] Noname: 😮 spintend mini is being delivered today 🙌
[2025-02-20T15:12:01] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): So we should send a poll to LY to make better quality motors (with of course impact on the price)
[2025-02-20T15:15:38] Hackintoshhhh: After i finish snsc, okay?
[2025-02-20T15:15:46] Hackintoshhhh: I don’t want to have obsolete motors alr
[2025-02-20T15:23:16] Smart Repair: lonnyo should at least clearly point out that the motors are not sealed. An official tutorial on which steps are necessary for this would be sufficient in my opinion
[2025-02-20T15:36:02] Mirono escooters: Is the servo pin on a 75100 pro V2 5v tolerant?
[2025-02-20T15:48:55] Noname: Testing a spark plug against clean frame might produce spark. But if threaded in dirty hole 😆 it might not. I've had that happen where the oil and junk kept it from sparking but you don't know because it's now installed and can't see it.
[2025-02-20T15:50:13] Eren: Okk
[2025-02-20T16:28:33] Mirono escooters: <video_file>

[2025-02-20T17:45:01] haku: like i said when im admin there will be deportations
[2025-02-20T17:45:04] Mirono escooters: No clue how you do PAS on vesc. Throttle ftw
[2025-02-20T17:45:14] Mirono escooters: Starting with you😛👌
[2025-02-20T17:46:18] haku: yes why is there no western alternatives to motors. atleast custom ones
[2025-02-20T17:47:10] Jan: No market outside of B2B
[2025-02-20T17:47:18] haku: true
[2025-02-20T17:47:25] Jan: Anyone dropping 600$ for motors?
[2025-02-20T17:47:29] Jan: Per piece
[2025-02-20T17:47:59] haku: not i unfortunately. there will be some. some wants the cream of the crop components
[2025-02-20T17:49:54] haku: just get new plugs jeez
[2025-02-20T17:50:22] haku: throw the old one on the ops window. happened to me once

[2025-02-21T03:02:47] Rose: Hey there Blade, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-02-21T04:26:26] Rose: Hey there Jefferson, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-02-21T05:37:34] Yamal: Good news!!!!
[2025-02-21T05:43:29] Yamal: Minimotors has certified and approved the thunder III, the first 72v scooter to be modeled
[2025-02-21T05:48:13] haku: isnt there a thunder 3 already?
[2025-02-21T05:50:07] Yamal: We are talking about legal scooters starting in January 2027 in Spain, the Thunder 3 has just been added, the first 72v to do so.
[2025-02-21T05:51:15] haku: nice! you are safe my boy. you got the thunder from down under
[2025-02-21T05:51:26] haku: rfp thunder
[2025-02-21T05:51:47] haku: 80h seven and tabless cells
[2025-02-21T05:52:16] Yamal: Need thunder 3 for 2027 xD
[2025-02-21T05:52:38] haku: but you wont be 72v yea. 96v?
[2025-02-21T05:54:01] haku: im praying laws dont come for us. but it highly likely. surron kids out of hand
[2025-02-21T05:54:22] Yamal: The first thing would be to acquire a legal scooter, because currently the Thunder 3 on the market are not legal before the law, only those that begin to be released as certified
[2025-02-21T05:54:31] haku: someone needs to rule em and make em law abiding
[2025-02-21T05:55:23] haku: can be modded? but how can cops know if its thunder 3 or 2?
[2025-02-21T05:55:34] haku: it looks similar

[2025-02-21T08:18:00] Yamal: Did you not see the appearance of the PCB? a melted jst connector in any place on the board, some blackened parts or components, it is better that you buy ubox 85150, I assure you
[2025-02-21T08:18:39] Mirono escooters: No?
[2025-02-21T08:21:46] Yamal: For what …
[2025-02-21T08:50:46] Finn: Pas is paddle assist
[2025-02-21T09:03:52] Mirono escooters: I can only select quadrature PAS sensor in vesc.. I wonder if it'll work with a normal 3 pin
[2025-02-21T09:04:23] Mirono escooters: Quadrature detects pedal speed and direction 3 pin only pedal speed
[2025-02-21T09:05:02] Jason: that has rings with magent
[2025-02-21T09:05:05] Jason: and sensor reads it
[2025-02-21T09:09:09] Jason: hmmm

[2025-02-21T21:23:06] haku: mine came with the rims though. i didnt read yamals other post. 100mm rim i think for 12 or 13" tires
[2025-02-21T21:34:26] Yamal: It came to me without a rim
[2025-02-21T21:39:28] Smart Repair: for me also including rim
[2025-02-21T21:42:16] Yamal: How much ?
[2025-02-21T21:42:28] haku: mucho dineros
[2025-02-21T21:43:10] Yamal: Pretty nice
[2025-02-21T21:43:14] haku: why no funny branding
[2025-02-21T21:43:28] haku: it have to say i love xi

[2025-02-21T21:45:11] Yamal: the name of my engines is a promise
[2025-02-21T21:45:33] Yamal: commitment/loyalty
[2025-02-21T21:45:46] haku: good branding
[2025-02-21T21:46:15] haku: my next one will be haku industries world wide
[2025-02-21T21:46:40] haku: or big big balls 100h
[2025-02-21T21:47:06] Yamal: Or “menuda loba”
[2025-02-21T21:48:25] haku: are you in US?
[2025-02-21T21:49:39] Smart Repair: Germany 20kmh 🤷‍♂️
[2025-02-21T21:49:42] haku: 100h 22x3 is that a good idea?
[2025-02-21T21:50:01] Yamal: 17/4 better
[2025-02-21T21:50:08] haku: burnouts and bitches will be the next moto
[2025-02-21T21:51:22] haku: the rear will have branding "burnouts and bitches" the front truly big big balls
[2025-02-21T21:52:03] Yamal: Controller ?
[2025-02-21T21:52:19] Smart Repair: 70H is the maximum for the GT. For 75H or more, the axle must be extensively reworked. for 70h I had to grind and heat both sides with a burner to bend them apart
[2025-02-21T21:52:26] haku: 12 fet will do for sure. not alot of amps
[2025-02-21T21:52:31] haku: 22x3

[2025-02-21T21:54:08] Smart Repair: I would also like
[2025-02-21T21:55:02] Yamal: 20s?
[2025-02-21T22:00:46] haku: just for burnouts wihout too much amps sure
[2025-02-21T22:02:02] Yamal: I mean gt2
[2025-02-21T22:02:52] haku: is your battery being built by a legend among men?
[2025-02-21T22:03:10] haku: or you making it yourself?
[2025-02-21T22:04:31] Smart Repair: yes, for now. next month I will probably build a new 22s battery. Now I have 20s9p 40p and -12V drop at 500A phase and I plan around +700A phase
[2025-02-21T22:06:11] Smart Repair: self-made
[2025-02-21T22:08:07] Dualtron Achilleus: Its 100v mofset i guess so
[2025-02-21T22:08:19] Yamal: X12?
[2025-02-21T22:08:30] Dualtron Achilleus: 23 should work
[2025-02-21T22:10:19] Smart Repair: currently front 85150, rear 85250. Tomorrow front 85250, rear x12

[2025-02-21T22:15:48] haku: thats pretty
[2025-02-21T22:15:59] haku: what cells in it?
[2025-02-21T22:19:54] Smart Repair: I think so too 😊 Let's see how much I can get out of the battery. The BMS should allow 550A battery current
[2025-02-21T22:20:03] Smart Repair: Eve 40
[2025-02-21T22:20:28] Smart Repair: officially gt1 converted to dual
[2025-02-21T22:21:57] haku: 40p?
[2025-02-21T22:23:02] Yamal: You get 33/2 ?

[2025-02-21T22:26:39] Smart Repair: .2
[2025-02-21T22:27:04] Smart Repair: plus and minus poles 3x 0.2
[2025-02-21T22:27:10] haku: yea printed seperators. ive seen it. i think @TherealLizardDoggo does it the same way. so nice
[2025-02-21T22:28:08] Adri: <photos/photo_21603@21-02-2025_22-28-08.jpg>
[2025-02-21T22:28:20] Adri: This controller with 100v mosfet will support 96v???

[2025-02-21T22:31:00] haku: yes jeebus. its just a term i like to use.
[2025-02-21T22:33:04] haku: bms outside is smart. easy to diagnose if out balance.
[2025-02-21T22:34:46] haku: i will shut my trap and start working too. need to stive for the bestest.
[2025-02-21T22:35:07] Dualtron Achilleus: these are not 100v they only 20s max
[2025-02-21T22:49:32] Yamal: I mean your new 70h

[2025-02-21T23:01:09] Smart Repair: that's true... but most of the time you are bound to the circumstances
[2025-02-21T23:01:50] Smart Repair: Yes, 22x3
[2025-02-21T23:23:03] Smart Repair: Mosfets according to datasheet 100V, Caps 100V. I think 22s max without ebrake
[2025-02-21T23:26:03] Smart Repair: I noticed earlier that Spintend uses two types of Mosfets. But both should be 100V
[2025-02-21T23:26:03] Smart Repair: <photos/photo_21609@21-02-2025_23-26-03.jpg>

[2025-02-22T01:40:50] haku: is this safe? to do? when actual 6.6 comes out do i need to re update it?
[2025-02-22T01:52:52] Izuna 生活: MXV is already available in 6.05. 6.06 BETA is interesting because of the PWM modulation - but don't know how much it does even benefit at these kind of speeds.
[2025-02-22T01:53:06] Izuna 生活: But sure, it's safe.
[2025-02-22T01:55:29] Izuna 生活: It's probably not much different to mxlemming, besides seemingly more fluent with higher current, but @Oreohuzky was pushing a lot of current on Ortega and probably just dumping a portion of it into heat. 😅
[2025-02-22T01:59:48] haku: how much current we talking here
[2025-02-22T02:00:31] haku: if its better than 6.5 for high current ill try
[2025-02-22T02:02:10] Izuna 生活: The version doesn't change much, it's just that we've optimized his efficiency and the observer works better than MXLEMMING lambda comp (in his case).
[2025-02-22T02:02:38] haku: gotcha. technical stuff
[2025-02-22T02:33:32] haku: would i notice anything better on my motors?

[2025-02-22T19:54:27] francois schempers: Short Answer The q-axis current factor (often shown in VESC as foc_fw_q_current_factor) is a small fraction of your field-weakening current that gets applied against the motor’s usual torque direction. In simpler terms, it’s a tiny built-in “negative torque” or braking effect whenever field weakening is active, helping the controller avoid overshoot or runaway speeds near top RPM. A typical default (like 2%) means you add about 2% of the FW current as a controlled braking force on the q-axis. Deeper Explanation Context: Field Weakening (FW) Field Weakening injects negative d-axis current so you can spin the motor faster than its natural “base speed.” For example, you might see a 10–20% higher top speed. However, once you’re above that base speed (i.e., in FW territory), the motor can become less stable if there’s zero demand on the torque axis (q-axis). The controller might lose some control or let the motor “spin freely” if you abruptly close the throttle. What the Q-Axis Factor Does Q-axis is your main torque-producing axis. The parameter foc_fw_q_current_factor says, “Take a small portion of the field-weakening current and apply it negatively on the q-axis.” Effect: This small negative torque counters freewheeling or overshoot at high speed. In essence, it provides a light, automatic braking when you’re in high-duty or field-weakening conditions and not demanding forward power. Why It’s Helpful Safety Net: If you have no q-axis braking at all (i.e. factor = 0), you can get situations where the motor coasts above the desired speed or the firmware is slow to respond if you suddenly let go of throttle. Smoother Transitions: With a small factor (like 2%), you get a gentle “drag” that keeps the controller’s observer stable, preventing big “wind-up” or random jerkiness in the transition from acceleration to coasting. Typical Values 2% is often used as a default so you don’t even notice the braking under normal riding; it’s just enough to help with control and keep everything stable during field weakening. Higher Values (5–10%) result in a stronger negative torque at top speeds, which might feel like early “engine brake.” If you find you’re losing too much top-end or it’s too draggy, you’d lower this factor. When to Adjust If you’re happy with how your scooter coasts at high speed and see no weird surging, you can leave it. If you experience overshoot (the motor spinning uncomfortably fast the moment you ease off throttle) or any “flutter” after letting go of throttle near top speed, increasing this factor a bit might help. If you feel you have too much engine braking and it’s hurting top-end performance, reducing this below 2% (or going to 0%) will remove that slight auto-brake effect—but be careful not to let the FW “run away.” In Summary Your “2%” q-axis current factor is basically a gentle negative torque added on top of field weakening. It’s there to keep the motor stable and avoid free-spinning or overshooting. Most riders find the small default value a good balance between retaining smooth coasting and preventing unwanted drifting or surging at high speeds. If your scooter feels fine, 2% is usually right where you want it.

[2025-02-22T21:00:48] francois schempers: Overmodulation is a technique in Field-Oriented Control (FOC) where the ESC deliberately drives the motor beyond the standard 100% modulation limit. In typical FOC: You apply three-phase sinewaves whose peak amplitude never reaches the full DC-bus voltage. If you think of “100% duty cycle” as the maximum continuous sine amplitude you can swing, then going beyond it would distort that sine wave into a trapezoid (or hexagon shape in space-vector modulation). By overmodulating (e.g., setting foc_overmod_factor to 1.05 or 1.15), the controller: 1. Pushes the motor voltage higher at peak demand, effectively approaching or briefly exceeding the normal “sinewave boundary.” 2. Gains a slight speed or torque benefit near the motor’s upper RPM range, because it can supply a bit more voltage to overcome back-EMF. 3. However, introduces distortion in the waveforms. Instead of a pure sine, you end up with partial “6-step” behavior at the top end. Why Use It? Extra Top Speed: Overmodulation can give you 5–15% more RPM without requiring full Field Weakening. Simpler Implementation: You don’t have to inject much (or any) negative d-current. Overmod is mostly a software tweak in the PWM space-vector routine. Downsides Wave Distortion → extra motor noise or potential torque ripple. You might feel slightly rougher operation at high throttle. More Switch Stresses: You’re running very close to bus voltage, so big transients (like letting off throttle quickly) can spike the ESC. Limited Gain: It’s just a small margin (say 1.05 to 1.15). If you want significantly higher speed, you still need Field Weakening or higher battery voltage. Practical Setting in VESC The parameter foc_overmod_factor typically defaults to 1.0 (disabled). If you set it to 1.1 or 1.15, it means at max throttle, the controller can stretch beyond 100% sine amplitude up to 110–115%. That yields a small “overdrive” zone. In sum, overmodulation is a way to squeeze extra RPM or power from the same voltage, but at the expense of more waveform distortion and potential extra stress on the system. It’s often a smaller, simpler “boost” compared to full-blown Field Weakening.

[2025-02-22T21:51:12] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Ok here is one .... When using MTPA (yeah i know ......) it gives massive torque but trips overcurrent (regardless of IQ Measured or IQ Target) to keep that under control i use input current map limit (95%). But what would be better solution to reach similar torque but stay within the limits of the ESC? We are just trail & error busy with the GT rebuilds and just want to squeeze out the max but still have torque to be able to get quick enough to top speed. (If required can send set of motor / app cfg's)
[2025-02-22T21:57:02] francois schempers: Q: *“When using MTPA (IQ Target or IQ Measured) on our scooter, we get incredible torque but keep tripping overcurrent. We tried limiting input current to ~95% as a workaround, but is there a better way to achieve strong torque without blowing the ESC?”* Below is a deeper look at *why* MTPA can overshoot current and *what* alternative tweaks or techniques you can do to keep peak torque high but avoid ESC faults. --- ## 1. Why MTPA Causes Overcurrent 1. Negative D-axis Injection - By design, MTPA injects negative d-axis current to exploit the motor’s Ld–Lq difference (saliency). This can produce a *very* high torque spike when the motor is in the right speed/load zone. 2. Instantaneous Current Surges - If your motor’s inductance is not large enough, or if your ESC sees a sudden jump in Q-axis demand plus the negative D-axis from MTPA, the *actual phase current* can spike well beyond your usual limit. - Even though the *average* might be under your setting, the *peak* can briefly exceed l_abs_current_max or cause “abs_over_current” faults. 3. Battery vs. Motor Current - At partial duty, the ESC is “stepping down” voltage, so the motor can pull large phase amps. In MTPA, you’re pushing negative d-current in addition to normal q-current. If that’s not carefully clamped, the phase amps can blow past safe levels. --- ## 2. Approaches to Control MTPA Overshoot ### 2.1 Limit the Negative d-axis Injection (MTPA Strength) If your firmware supports it, you can: - Use a smaller Ld–Lq difference: Some advanced builds artificially lower the “foc_motor_ld_lq_diff” parameter (e.g. from 0.000004 to 0.000003) so the controller calculates less negative d-current. - Cap the negative d-current: Certain VESC forks or more recent versions let you define a maximum negative d-axis (like a “d-axis clamp”). That’s a direct way to “soften” MTPA’s injection so it’s not so aggressive. > Effect: You keep *some* benefit from MTPA, but you won’t see huge over-shoot. The motor won’t produce the absolute peak torque, but you’re less likely to pass overcurrent thresholds. --- ### 2.2 Shorten the MTPA Range (Duty or Speed) If your motor only benefits from MTPA in a certain RPM window (e.g., mid-speed), you can: - Use standard torque at low RPM (where overcurrent is biggest risk). - Enable MTPA above a certain duty cycle or speed threshold. > This can be done by hacking observer code or using scripting to turn on MTPA partially. It’s more advanced, but it effectively reduces the times you combine large q-current + big negative d-current. --- ### 2.3 Use a Smaller “Input Current Map Start” You mentioned you’re at 95% (0.95). You can try: - Go lower, e.g. 80–90%. Then your Q-axis is forced to scale back earlier, preventing the huge torque spikes that occur if MTPA is piling on negative d-current at the same time. - Pros: You still have MTPA for quick torque below that fraction of max input current, but it ramps down so you don’t cross ESC’s safety margin. - Cons: You might lose some top-end grunt if you rely on that last 10–20% of input amps for big speed runs. --- ### 2.4 More Conservative Current Limits (Phase or Battery) 1. Phase Current: If you suspect MTPA pushes you from, say, 150–160 A to 200–220 A “spikes,” reduce “Motor Current Max” to ~120–130 A. The negative d-current still yields strong torque, but the absolute peak is now clamped. 2. Battery Current: If your BMS or battery can’t handle sudden surges, you can’t rely on l_in_current_max alone. Overcurrent is often *phase* limited, so it’s the “l_current_max” (motor amps) that helps more. > Tip: In many high-power setups, simply lowering phase amps by 10–20% still gives 90% of the seat-of-pants torque, but drastically lowers the chance of blowouts. --- ### 2.5 Softer Throttle or Torque Ramp
[2025-02-22T21:57:02] francois schempers: - Throttle Curve: Setting a non-linear throttle ramp so that the last 20% of throttle is “expanded.” This means the motor doesn’t jump from 60% to 100% q-current instantly, giving the controller time to catch the big surge. - Current Ramp Step (cc_ramp_step_max or “throttle ramp”): If you let the current build up slightly slower, MTPA won't spike as violently in the first milliseconds of throttle. > Benefit: You can preserve high max amps but avoid a short spike that triggers ABS Overcurrent. Just a small smoothing factor can help. --- ## 3. Which Is “Best”? 1. If you want maximum mid-range torque: *Limiting negative D-axis injection* is probably the more direct approach. It stays within your ESC capabilities, but still harnesses MTPA. 2. If you’re already comfortable with partial torque: *Reducing motor current max* is simplest. 3. If your main problem is short surges: *Slowing throttle ramp or setting a more advanced ramp curve* can keep you from crossing that overcurrent threshold in the first place. 4. Combining: Some do both partial negative-d clamp and a smaller input current map start (maybe 80–85%) to ensure you never jump into meltdown territory. --- ## 4. Additional Debug Steps 1. Log Actual Phase Current - If your firmware or VESC variant can, record real-time stats. See exactly how high the phase amps go during your MTPA “blow past limit” event. That helps you pick a new clamp more precisely. 2. Try Slightly Lower “foc_motor_ld_lq_diff” - If detection gave you, e.g., 3.7e-6, experiment with 2.9–3.0e-6. That artificially reduces the MTPA injection. If the motor is truly IPM, you still get a torque boost, just not as extreme. 3. Recheck Overmodulation / Field Weakening - If you are also using a big “overmod factor” or “field weakening,” the combined effect with MTPA can cause bigger overshoots. Maybe reduce FW or keep it only for high RPM so you don’t stack them at mid speeds. --- ## 5. Conclusion - Input Current Map Limit is a decent workaround but can sometimes strangle the last bit of acceleration you want. A more elegant solution is capping the negative D-axis used by MTPA or slightly lowering phase amps** so your ESC never sees those lethal current spikes. - In short, if you aim for “squeeze-out” performance but keep reliability: 1. Reduce MTPA aggression (Ld–Lq or negative-D clamp) 2. Modulate ramp (throttle / torque ramp) 3. Tune your input current map more narrowly (80–90% instead of 95%), or 4. Lower motor max amps by ~10–15% That way you still get excellent torque and decent top speed but avoid immediate overcurrent triggers. A lot of *trial & error* is normal: watch your real-time logs, see what peak phase amps appear, and fine-tune from there.

[2025-02-22T21:58:01] francois schempers: it's currently being done I'll soon ask the community to double check it
[2025-02-22T22:00:25] Patrick: Amazing is it explained that way everyone can understand it?
[2025-02-22T22:06:04] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Damn ..... This is amazing food for reading and mostly spot on .... (now searching for that damn "Cap the negative d-current" using 6.06 but doesnt look it has it (or me stupid)
[2025-02-22T22:13:41] francois schempers: Q: *“In firmware 6.06, I can’t find the ‘Cap negative d-current’ parameter you mentioned—am I missing something? Or is it simply not there?”* Below is some background on that feature and what you *can* do in the standard firmware: --- ## 1. Official Firmware Doesn’t Directly Expose a “Negative D Clamp” - As of 6.0x (including 6.06), the mainline VESC code hasn’t offered a user-facing parameter called “d-axis clamp” or “max negative Id.” Instead, MTPA is toggled by: - Setting foc_mtpa_mode = IQ_TARGET or IQ_MEASURED, - Using foc_motor_ld_lq_diff to define saliency, - Possibly adjusting foc_motor_flux_linkage, etc. The firmware then calculates negative d-current automatically, based on real-time torque demands. There’s *no direct slider* to say “don’t exceed -20A on d-axis,” for example—unless you modify the code or use a specialized branch. --- ## 2. Workaround Approaches ### 2.1 “Fake” Lower Motor Saliency (foc_motor_ld_lq_diff) - The simplest, though indirect, method is to slightly reduce foc_motor_ld_lq_diff from your measured value. - Result: The firmware believes the motor’s Ld–Lq difference is smaller, so it calculates less negative d-axis current. - Practical Example: - If detection gave you 3.7e-6, try 2.8–3.0e-6. - You’ll get a milder MTPA effect, thus fewer big spikes. Caution: Reducing it too much may practically disable MTPA. If you want some MTPA, you have to find a sweet spot by trial & error. --- ### 2.2 Lower the Overall Phase Current - If your biggest problem is short spikes, one broad approach is to set l_current_max to a modest number. Because negative d-current *adds* to the Q-axis current for total phase amplitude. - Even dropping motor amps by ~10% can push the peaks below the ESC’s overcurrent threshold. - Not as “surgical” as a d-axis clamp, but easy to do in the VESC Tool. --- ### 2.3 Throttle/Torque Ramp Adjustments - In the “Current” or “Duty” control page, look for cc_ramp_step_max or “acceleration” settings. - By limiting how fast the ESC can demand full torque, you give MTPA less chance to cause a sudden blow-up. - End result: You still see near the same torque, but it might take a fraction of a second longer to ramp up—lowering the instantaneous current spike. --- ### 2.4 Experimental Code Forks - Some “private” or alternative VESC forks (for instance, certain e-bike or e-scooter dev branches) do have a negative d clamp or partial MTPA scaling. - If you’re comfortable compiling custom firmware, you could edit “fw/applications/app_mtpa.c” or the relevant portion in mcpwm_foc.c to forcibly limit negative id. - For example, something like: if (id < -my_d_current_limit) { id = -my_d_current_limit; } - This is more advanced, but if you or someone in the community codes for the VESC firmware, it’s feasible to insert. --- ## 3. Final Thoughts - Out-of-the-box: VESC 6.06 lacks a simple “Max Negative D-Axis Current” slider. - Pragmatic Fix: Try faking lower saliency (foc_motor_ld_lq_diff) or simply reduce total motor amps by ~10–20%. Coupled with a gentle torque ramp, you’ll probably avoid overcurrent while still enjoying a chunk of MTPA’s torque boost. - If you crave a more “perfect” negative d clamp, you’ll likely have to patch the source code or find a specialized firmware fork—so until that lands in official VESC, the best you can do is tune around it. That said, for most high-power builds, even partial MTPA gains are substantial. As long as you keep logs and test carefully, you can strike a balance between big torque and reliable hardware. here is some examples on how you could implement d clamp Below is a minimal, example patch illustrating how you might implement a negative d-axis clamp in the VESC firmware (6.06 or similar). This snippet assumes basic familiarity with building VESC firmware from source and modifying mcpwm_foc.c (or the relevant FOC control file).
[2025-02-22T22:13:41] francois schempers: > Disclaimer > 1. This code is example-only—not official or guaranteed safe. > 2. The VESC code is released under the GNU GPL v3 license. Make sure any changes you distribute remain GPL-compliant. > 3. Actual line numbers/variable names can differ between firmware versions. You’ll likely need to search for the relevant function(s) (mcpwm_foc_run_filters, mcpwm_foc_control_current, or a portion that calculates MTPA). > 4. Testing on a dev setup (motor on bench, low voltage) is crucial before going full throttle on a high-power build. --- ## 1. Find Where MTPA D–Q Currents Are Set In mcpwm_foc.c (around functions that handle the current loops, often near mcpwm_foc_set_idq(), mcpwm_foc_control_current(), or MTPA logic), you’ll see something like: `c // Original logic to set the d and q reference currents float id_set = /* computed or retrieved from MTPA logic */; float iq_set = /* main torque request (q-axis) */; Somewhere after MTPA calculation but before running the final current controller, you can inject a check to clamp negative d-current. For example: // If MTPA or some negative d injection is used // you might see an id_set that goes below a certain negative threshold // Introduce a user-defined clamp, e.g., -d_clamp_value float d_clamp_value = 20.0f; // Example limit in AMPS, tune as needed Then right before the function sets the final id_set, do: // [Pseudo-code snippet] // Some user-defined negative clamp, e.g. -20A // If id_set < -20, we clip it to -20. if (id_set < -d_clamp_value) { id_set = -d_clamp_value; } --- 2. Example Patch Below is a more concrete example. Suppose you define a new parameter conf_general.h or you hard-code it. Let’s assume you do it inline. You might add something like: // File: mcpwm_foc.c // 1) Add a small “user clamp” for negative d-axis static float d_axis_neg_clamp = 20.0f; // 20 A negative limit void mcpwm_foc_some_current_logic(float *id_target, float *iq_target) { // ... code computing MTPA, or retrieving id_target from mtpa // For example, if *id_target is negative: if (*id_target < -d_axis_neg_clamp) { *id_target = -d_axis_neg_clamp; } // Then proceed with setting up the FOC control // ... } You’d call this logic after the MTPA routine that sets d-axis. The exact location differs by version, but typically VESC code does something like: // ... // [MTPA logic in i_d_set, i_q_set] i_d_set = <some negative if using MTPA>; i_q_set = <normal torque command>; // Insert clamp if (i_d_set < -d_axis_neg_clamp) { i_d_set = -d_axis_neg_clamp; } // Then the code goes on to run current controller mcpwm_foc_set_idq(i_d_set, i_q_set); --- 3. Configurability You might want to make d_axis_neg_clamp a real configuration parameter. 1. Put it in the mc_configuration structure. 2. Expose it in conf_general.h or as a new UI field in the VESC Tool. That requires you to do a bit more coding: read from the JSON/app config, store it in the RAM config, etc. So, simplest is just a static float for your personal firmware. --- 4. Additional Notes 1. Units: The clamp is in Amps. Decide what maximum negative Id you can handle—maybe 10–30 A. You’ll have to test in real scenario. 2. Tradeoff: The more you clamp negative d, the less “aggressive” your MTPA torque. 3. Observer Impact: This doesn’t rewrite the observer itself. The sensorless observer might see slightly different actual d–q currents, but it’s typically stable. --- 5. Testing & Verification Steps 1. Low-Voltage Bench Test: Use a small battery or lab supply, spin the motor at partial speed, watch for overcurrent faults. 2. Watch Logs: Confirm the actual id_set never drops below the clamp. 3. Tune: If 20 A is still causing short surges, reduce it to 15 or 10. If it’s too timid, raise it slightly. --- Final Thoughts
[2025-02-22T22:13:41] francois schempers: This negative d clamp is basically a quick guard rail: “No matter what MTPA wants, we never set d-axis below -X amps.” While not an official “slider” in 6.06, the patch above shows where you’d insert the logic. With it, you can mitigate violent current spikes while still leveraging MTPA—just not as far into the negative-d territory. Remember: always keep your ESC’s thermal and electrical headroom in mind. Even with a clamp, huge torque requests can produce borderline or repeated overcurrent events. Adjusting your overall motor/battery amps, throttle ramp, or motor saliency can further refine things. Good luck hacking the firmware. With careful testing, this snippet can help you keep MTPA workable, safer, and more predictable under VESC 6.06!

[2025-02-23T22:11:15] haku: i told you do research first dam you. dont believe me 100%
[2025-02-23T22:11:25] francois schempers: Below is a concise explanation of why your motor may be saturating (thus limiting current to ~100 A) and a few practical approaches to mitigate that saturation. --- 1. Motor Saturation Explained Magnetic saturation happens when the iron (or ferrite) in the motor’s stator core reaches a point where it can’t magnetize any further. At that point, feeding more current does not yield additional torque; instead, energy is lost to heat, and voltage/current waveforms can become distorted. In a typical BLDC hub or outrunner motor: The stator’s laminations have a certain thickness and quality (silicon steel or similar). When phase current is low or moderate, the stator can guide the magnetic field without issues. At high phase current (e.g., above 100–120 A in certain motors), the material can saturate, limiting how much additional torque (or current) can flow effectively. --- 2. Why Saturation Limits Motor Current When the motor saturates, the motor’s inductance actually drops because of the nonlinear magnetic path. This can: 1. Cause excessive current ripple in the windings, forcing the ESC firmware to clamp or reduce actual current to keep safe control loops. 2. Prevent any net torque increase beyond that saturation point—so even if the ESC tries to push more amps, you won’t see an actual rise in “measured motor current” or real torque output. Thus, from the VESC/Spintend’s perspective, it might see an overcurrent risk or observe that further command is “ineffective,” and the real motor current readout hovers around 100 A, no matter if you request 120–150 A. --- 3. Possible Solutions 1. Upgrade to a Larger Motor Physical Size/Volume: A physically bigger stator (with more iron mass and/or higher-quality laminations) will saturate at higher currents. Lower kV Winding: Motors with more turns per stator tooth can handle higher phase current before hitting saturation (though it does shift the speed/voltage trade-off). 2. Lower (or Accept) the Phase Current Limit If your motor is saturating at ~100 A, pushing it to 150 A or 200 A seldom yields more torque or performance. You can safely reduce your Motor Current Max in the ESC to ~100–110 A to avoid wasted energy and potential overcurrent faults. 3. Improve Cooling While more efficient cooling (ferrofluid, hubsinks, better airflow) does not truly raise the magnetic saturation threshold, it can slow down or prevent overheating from near-saturation operation. You may sustain 100 A longer without thermal throttling. If temperature was your limiting factor, better cooling helps. If purely magnetic saturation is the issue, cooling alone won’t let you surpass that 100 A barrier by much. 4. Magnetic Rework or “Better Motor Iron” In extreme DIY, some advanced users might re-laminate or rework stators, but that’s rarely practical. Easier to pick a motor known for higher current capacity. 5. Check FOC Settings In VESC Tool, ensure your detection is correct—misconfigured flux linkage or saturations can mislead the controller, artificially limiting current. Re-run detection or slightly tweak observer gain. If using MTPA or field weakening, big negative d-axis current can force the core deeper into saturation. Disabling or reducing MTPA or FW amplitude sometimes stabilizes higher q-axis current (but at a cost of top speed or torque efficiency). --- 4. Bottom Line If your Spintend 85150 or similar VESC-based ESC is capping around 100 A motor current, the most common reason is that the motor itself physically can’t handle more before hitting magnetic saturation. To solve it: 1. Use a bigger motor (larger or better stator). 2. Limit your motor current to the saturation point for efficiency. 3. Optimize cooling to maintain performance near saturation current. 4. Double-check your firmware detection and advanced settings so you aren’t artificially limiting current by an incorrect parameter.
[2025-02-23T22:11:25] francois schempers: This ensures you get maximum stable torque from your existing setup while avoiding wasted energy, overheating, or random cutouts caused by trying to push the motor beyond its magnetic limits.

[2025-02-24T05:45:17] francois schempers: this is llm generated, so take it or leave it but double check, this time it even gave me some code for custom traction control, didn't test it
[2025-02-24T05:45:55] francois schempers: Q: Is there any way to use traction control depending on the speed and not via ERP?! For example, current-dependent or with an external wheel speed sensor? Since I have two different motors, I also have different ERP, which the TC interprets as spinning. Yes, there are multiple ways to implement traction control without relying solely on electrical RPM (eRPM). The main issue with eRPM-based traction control is that different motors (especially with different KV ratings, winding configurations, or wheel diameters) will produce different eRPM values for the same actual wheel speed. This leads to false slip detection when using a naive eRPM-based approach. Alternative Methods for Traction Control To make traction control more accurate and adaptable, you can use the following methods: 1. Back-EMF Based Traction Control (Internal Method) By comparing the actual back-EMF voltage against the expected voltage (calculated from speed), we can estimate slip without needing an external sensor. This is useful for sensorless operation, where direct wheel speed readings are unavailable. 2. External Wheel Speed Sensor (External Method) A hall-based, optical, or magnetic encoder placed on the wheel can measure actual ground speed. This allows for more reliable slip detection, especially if you have mismatched motors. 3. Current-Based Slip Detection If one motor is drawing significantly more current than expected for a given speed while another motor draws less, this suggests one wheel may be slipping. However, this method is less direct and may require complex filtering. Recommended Approach: Back-EMF Based Traction Control The Back-EMF method provides a built-in, sensorless solution without needing external hardware. Below is a complete implementation that refines traction control using back-EMF voltage as a slip indicator. --- Code: Traction Control Using Back-EMF The following C-based traction control algorithm smooths out back-EMF readings, detects sustained slip events, and adjusts motor current gradually to restore traction. // ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- // Improved Traction Control using Back-EMF // ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- // Tunable Constants – Adjust these based on your motor and hardware tests. #define MOTOR_CONSTANT 0.02f // [V/(eRPM)] Converts motor speed (ERPM) to expected back-EMF. #define TRACTION_SLIP_THRESHOLD 0.8f // Slip ratio threshold below which slip is considered occurring. #define TRACTION_MIN_REDUCTION 0.5f // Minimum reduction factor (i.e. never reduce below 50% of original current). #define FILTER_ALPHA 0.1f // Low-pass filter coefficient (0<alpha<1). Lower alpha = slower response. #define SLIP_DETECT_CYCLES 5 // Number of consecutive cycles with slip before engaging traction control. #define CURRENT_RATE_LIMIT 0.05f // Maximum fractional change (per cycle) allowed in current setpoint (e.g. 5%). #define RECOVERY_TIME_CYCLES 10 // Number of cycles to wait before beginning to restore full current. // Global variables (these would typically be members of your motor control data structure) float motor_speed_erpm; // Measured electrical RPM of the motor. float raw_back_emf; // Raw measured back-EMF (in Volts), updated each control cycle. float filtered_back_emf; // Filtered back-EMF value. float original_current_setpoint; // The original desired current (target) setpoint (in Amps). float current_setpoint; // The current commanded motor current (in Amps). bool traction_control_enabled; // Flag to enable or disable traction control. // Internal counters for persistent slip detection and recovery. int slip_counter = 0; // Counts how many consecutive cycles slip condition is detected. int recovery_counter = 0; // Counts cycles since slip condition ended.
[2025-02-24T05:45:55] francois schempers: // ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- // Low-Pass Filter Function // Applies a simple exponential smoothing to reduce noise in the raw back-EMF reading. float lowpass_filter(float previous, float new_val, float alpha) { return (alpha * new_val) + ((1.0f - alpha) * previous); } // ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- // Rate Limiter Function // Gradually adjusts a value (here, current_setpoint) toward a target value // by a maximum fractional step per cycle. float rate_limiter(float current, float target, float rate_limit) { if (current > target) { float diff = current - target; float max_step = original_current_setpoint * rate_limit; if (diff > max_step) return current - max_step; else return target; } else if (current < target) { float diff = target - current; float max_step = original_current_setpoint * rate_limit; if (diff > max_step) return current + max_step; else return target; } return current; } // ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- // update_traction_control() // This function should be called at each control cycle after updating raw sensor // values. It uses a filtered back-EMF measurement and compares it to the expected // back-EMF (calculated from motor speed) to determine if slip is occurring. // It then gradually scales down the current_setpoint if persistent slip is detected, // and slowly restores full current when slip is resolved. void update_traction_control(void) { // 1. Filter the raw back-EMF to smooth out noise. filtered_back_emf = lowpass_filter(filtered_back_emf, raw_back_emf, FILTER_ALPHA); // 2. Calculate the expected back-EMF based on the current motor speed. float expected_back_emf = MOTOR_CONSTANT * motor_speed_erpm; // 3. If expected back-EMF is very low, skip traction control. if (expected_back_emf < 0.1f) { return; } // 4. Compute the slip ratio (filtered measured back-EMF divided by expected back-EMF). float slip_ratio = filtered_back_emf / expected_back_emf; // 5. Traction control logic: if (traction_control_enabled && (slip_ratio < TRACTION_SLIP_THRESHOLD)) { slip_counter++; recovery_counter = 0; if (slip_counter >= SLIP_DETECT_CYCLES) { float reduction_factor = slip_ratio / TRACTION_SLIP_THRESHOLD; if (reduction_factor < TRACTION_MIN_REDUCTION) { reduction_factor = TRACTION_MIN_REDUCTION; } float target_current = original_current_setpoint * reduction_factor; current_setpoint = rate_limiter(current_setpoint, target_current, CURRENT_RATE_LIMIT); } } else { if (slip_counter > 0) { recovery_counter++; if (recovery_counter >= RECOVERY_TIME_CYCLES) { current_setpoint = rate_limiter(current_setpoint, original_current_setpoint, CURRENT_RATE_LIMIT); if (current_setpoint >= original_current_setpoint) { slip_counter = 0; recovery_counter = 0; } } } else { current_setpoint = original_current_setpoint; } } } --- How This Code Works 1. Back-EMF Filtering A low-pass filter smooths the back-EMF readings to remove noise. 2. Slip Detection Logic If filtered back-EMF is significantly lower than expected, it suggests loss of traction. Uses slip_counter to ensure traction control doesn’t trigger from a single bad reading. 3. Current Reduction Mechanism If slip is detected for multiple cycles, it gradually reduces motor current using a rate limiter to prevent sudden loss of power. 4. Recovery Mechanism If slip stops, it slowly restores full motor current rather than an abrupt jump back. --- Why Use This Over eRPM-Based Traction Control?
[2025-02-24T05:45:56] francois schempers: Works even if you have mismatched motors with different ERPM values. More reliable on slippery surfaces where wheels spin but eRPM fluctuates inconsistently. Doesn’t require additional sensors, unlike an external wheel encoder. Smoother response, thanks to filtering and gradual recovery. --- Final Considerations If using two motors, apply this logic independently to each motor to prevent mismatches. Test in real conditions, log slip ratios, and adjust TRACTION_SLIP_THRESHOLD. Future improvements could include: Adaptive slip thresholds based on torque demand. Combining current sensing and back-EMF to improve slip detection. This sensorless traction control is a step forward for VESC-based scooters and e-bikes, especially for high-power builds with unevenly matched motors!

PWM & COMMUTATION -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 1.1 PWM Mode Param: pwm_mode What It Does • The PWM mode to use for BLDC motors. Synchronous is the most tested and recommended mode. • Possible Values: Nonsynchronous HISW, Synchronous, Bipolar Deeper Insights • Synchronous ensures both high-side and low-side transistors are used in each switching cycle, often giving better efficiency and lower noise. • Nonsynchronous HISW is older: only high-side transistors do PWM, the low-side is fully on or off. • Bipolar is typically for specialized or academic contexts. How / When to Modify • Most modern VESC hardware is stable with Synchronous. • Only choose Nonsynchronous or Bipolar if your hardware or documentation explicitly recommends it. Potential Side Effects • Switching Synchronous → Nonsynchronous can raise MOSFET temperatures or trigger partial conduction issues at certain duty cycles. • Bipolar is untested in many mainstream VESC contexts, so proceed with caution. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 1.2 Commutation Mode Param: comm_mode What It Does • Used in BLDC sensorless mode to define how zero-cross detection and commutation timing is handled. • Values: Integrate, Delay Deeper Insights • Integrate samples back-EMF continuously after a zero crossing, integrating the waveform. More robust at low speed. • Delay is simpler: detect zero-cross, then add a fixed time offset. It’s less accurate under heavy load. How / When to Modify • Integrate is better for typical e-scooters or e-bikes with frequent low-speed starts. • Delay might suffice if your motor rarely sees low RPM or if you prefer a simpler approach. Potential Side Effects • Delay can lead to stuttering at very low speed or heavier loads. • Integrate might require more accurate BEMF coupling parameters from detection. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 1.3 Motor Type Param: motor_type What It Does • Chooses the fundamental commutation approach: BLDC (Trapezoidal), DC (brushed motor), or FOC (Field Oriented Control). Deeper Insights • BLDC = trapezoidal commutation, somewhat louder, slightly less efficient. • DC is only for brushed DC motors. Rare in modern setups. • FOC is advanced: quieter operation, better torque control, supports field weakening & MTPA. How / When to Modify • If the hardware supports it, FOC is usually best for noise & efficiency. • BLDC is still used on older or simpler VESC boards. Potential Side Effects • If your ESC can’t handle FOC well, you may see DRV or MOSFET errors at high load or voltage. • DC motor mode is irrelevant for typical brushless scooter/e-bike setups. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 1.4 Sensor Mode Param: sensor_mode What It Does • Applies only in BLDC mode. Chooses between Sensorless, Sensored, or Hybrid (low speed with sensors, high speed sensorless). Deeper Insights • Hybrid = halls at startup, then reverts to sensorless for efficiency. • Pure sensored means halls are used throughout the RPM range. • Sensorless is for motors without sensors or if you prefer no hall wiring. How / When to Modify • For a BLDC build with hall sensors, Hybrid is recommended for smooth takeoff. • If no hall sensors exist, sensorless is your only option. Potential Side Effects • Sensorless can cause rough startup on heavy loads. • Sensored-only might have overhead or timing offsets at high RPM, but it’s minor in practice. -------------------------------------------------- 🔹 2. CURRENT & BATTERY LIMITS --------------------------------------------------
[2025-02-24T06:24:43] francois schempers: 🔧 2.1 Motor Current Max Param: l_current_max What It Does • Maximum positive (forward) phase current into the motor. Defines peak torque. Deeper Insights • Phase current can exceed battery current at partial throttle due to duty cycle step-down. • Setting too high can overheat the motor or saturate the ESC’s thermal limits. How / When to Modify • Check motor’s continuous & peak ratings. • Watch motor temperature on test rides before going higher. Potential Side Effects • Excessively high = thermal runaway in motor windings or ESC MOSFET burnouts. • Too low = weak acceleration, under-utilized motor. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 2.2 Motor Current Max Brake Param: l_current_min (negative) What It Does • Maximum negative phase current (braking torque). The energy from braking goes back to the ESC and potentially the battery. Deeper Insights • Large negative phase current can generate very strong braking torque even if your battery regen limit is smaller. The difference is dissipated as heat in MOSFETs. How / When to Modify • Increase negativity if you want stronger e-brake. • If your hardware or motor overheats on repeated downhills, reduce it. Potential Side Effects • Overstress of the ESC if the negative phase current is too high. • If battery can’t accept that much regen, you might see BMS cut or overvoltage fault. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 2.3 Battery Current Max Param: l_in_current_max What It Does • The maximum drawn from the battery side. Major factor in your “forward” power limit. Deeper Insights • This must respect your BMS or cell’s discharge capability (continuous/peak). • The battery current is usually lower than the motor current except at high duty cycles. How / When to Modify • If your BMS is rated 60A, set ~60A here. • If your battery is large and robust, you can push it higher. Potential Side Effects • Battery or BMS overload if set too high, triggering abrupt BMS cut mid-ride. • If set too low, your top speed might still be fine at high duty, but acceleration will be limited. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 2.4 Battery Current Max Regen Param: l_in_current_min (negative) What It Does • Maximum negative battery current. Limits how much regenerative current is fed back into the battery. Deeper Insights • If your battery can handle 10A charging, set about -10A. • This is separate from motor braking current max: the ESC will limit battery current accordingly. How / When to Modify • If your BMS or cells can handle more charge current, you can set a bigger negative number for stronger regen. • If your battery is frequently near full, high regen can cause overvoltage. Potential Side Effects • If set too negative, you risk BMS triggers or cell damage from large charge bursts. • If set not negative enough, your regen braking power is minimal. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 2.5 Input Current Limit Map Start Param: l_in_current_map_start What It Does • Tells the ESC to begin limiting Q-axis current once battery current hits some fraction (like 80–90%) of max input current. Default is 1.0 (off). Deeper Insights • Helpful if you do field weakening or MTPA and see battery current overshoots near top speed. • E.g., setting 0.8 means at 80% of battery limit, it starts restricting additional torque. How / When to Modify • If your logs show battery current spikes to 100% instantaneously causing oscillation, set around 0.8 or 0.9. • If no issues, leaving it at 1 is fine. Potential Side Effects • If set too low, you artificially reduce max power well before full capacity. • If set too high, you might see minor current oscillations at top-end. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 2.6 Input Current Map Filter Param: l_in_current_map_filter What It Does • A filtering constant (0–1) that smooths battery current data before applying Q-axis limit in the “map start” feature.
[2025-02-24T06:24:43] francois schempers: Deeper Insights • A smaller number (0.005) = heavier smoothing. • A bigger (0.1) = minimal filtering, more real-time reaction but can be noisy. How / When to Modify • If you see “hunting” or surging at high speed, use heavier filtering (like 0.005–0.01). • If you need snappier response, go higher. Potential Side Effects • Too much filtering can let short battery spikes slip through. • Too little filtering can cause torque pulsing near the limit. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 2.7 Absolute Maximum Current Param: l_abs_current_max What It Does • A hard fault threshold. If current magnitude exceeds this, the ESC disables output instantly. Deeper Insights • Typically set higher than normal to avoid nuisance trips from short spikes (150–300A, for instance). How / When to Modify • If you get random ABS_OVER_CURRENT faults, either raise this or enable slow filtering (l_slow_abs_current). • Keep it sufficiently above your normal current to handle transients. Potential Side Effects • Setting it too high can let a real short-circuit go on longer, risking hardware damage. • Setting it too low = repeated overcurrent faults on normal spikes. -------------------------------------------------- 🔹 3. RPM & DUTY LIMITS -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 3.1 Max ERPM Reverse Param: l_min_erpm What It Does • Maximum negative electrical RPM if reversing is allowed. Deeper Insights • For no reverse, set 0. • For partial reverse, set a negative eRPM that matches desired reverse speed. How / When to Modify • Most e-scooters do not use reverse: set it 0 if you want to disable reversing. • For small vehicles needing reverse, pick a negative limit aligned with safe speeds. Potential Side Effects • If reversing is enabled but user is unaware, accidental negative throttle can jerk you backward. • Large negative eRPM can cause mechanical stress if you force full speed reverse. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 3.2 Max ERPM Param: l_max_erpm What It Does • The maximum electrical RPM. The ESC enforces a speed cap. Deeper Insights • eRPM = mechanical RPM × number_of_pole_pairs. • E.g., 14 magnet motor => 7 pole pairs, so 6000 mechanical RPM => 42000 eRPM. How / When to Modify • If you want an artificial top-speed limit, reduce it from your default. • If you have a large motor that can spin beyond 100k eRPM, set a suitably high number. Potential Side Effects • If too low, you’ll never reach your mechanical potential. • Hard limit can feel abrupt if l_erpm_start is high (like 0.95 or 1.0 fraction). -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 3.3 ERPM Limit Start Param: l_erpm_start What It Does • The fraction of l_max_erpm where the current begins to ramp down. So 0.8 means at 80% of max eRPM, torque is gradually limited. Deeper Insights • This yields a soft approach to top speed rather than an abrupt cutoff. How / When to Modify • 0.8 is typical if you want a smoother cap. • 1.0 means no soft zone: a harsh limit near max eRPM. Potential Side Effects • If set too low (like 0.5), you lose mid-range power unnecessarily. • If set 1.0, the cutoff can be jarring. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 3.4 Max ERPM Full Brake / Max ERPM Full Brake Current Control Param: l_max_erpm_fbrake, l_max_erpm_fbrake_cc What It Does • BLDC-specific parameters for controlling or disallowing a full brake or direction change below certain ERPM thresholds. Deeper Insights • Typically used if you allow reversing in BLDC mode. • In FOC, these are generally ignored or less relevant. How / When to Modify • If you don’t plan on reversing, default is fine. • If you do reversing, be sure you set safe speeds for direction changes. Potential Side Effects • Setting them too high can let you attempt direction reversals at dangerous speeds in BLDC. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 3.5 Minimum Input Voltage / Maximum Input Voltage Params: l_min_vin, l_max_vin What It Does • ESC throws fault if supply voltage is below min or above max.
[2025-02-24T06:24:43] francois schempers: Deeper Insights • For 36/42V nominal, a typical max is 57V. • For 72V setups (84V full), you must raise l_max_vin to ~90–95V. How / When to Modify • Always match your battery’s highest charge voltage plus margin. • Set l_min_vin slightly below your normal cutoff. Potential Side Effects • If l_max_vin is too low for a 20S battery, you’ll get Over_Voltage fault at full charge. • If l_min_vin is too high, you get Under_Voltage cutout even if battery is still partially usable. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 3.6 Battery Voltage Cutoff Start / End Params: l_battery_cut_start, l_battery_cut_end What It Does • Gradually reduces motor power as voltage nears the cutoff. Full braking is still allowed. Deeper Insights • Example: For 10S Li-ion, set start ~34V, end ~30V. • This helps avoid abrupt BMS cut. How / When to Modify • Base on your cell’s recommended min voltage (like 3.0V/cell for Li-ion). • If your BMS cuts at 2.8V/cell, set a slightly higher end for safety. Potential Side Effects • If set too high, you lose performance with significant capacity left. • If too low, you risk damaging cells or hitting BMS cutoff anyway. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 3.7 Battery Voltage Regen Cutoff Start / End Params: l_battery_regen_cut_start, l_battery_regen_cut_end What It Does • Similar concept but for regenerative braking on a full battery to prevent overcharge. Deeper Insights • For a 20S battery (84V fully charged), you might set start=82V, end=84V. • If left default (1000 & 1100), it never triggers, risking overvoltage on steep downhills with full charge. How / When to Modify • Set according to your pack’s max voltage. • If you live in hilly areas, ensure this is correct or BMS may force a dangerous cutoff mid-brake. Potential Side Effects • If start is set too low, you rarely get regen. • If not configured, you could blow the BMS or see “OverVoltage” faults at full battery. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 3.8 Slow ABS Current Limit Param: l_slow_abs_current What It Does • Uses a filtered measurement for the absolute max current fault, preventing triggers on very short spikes. Deeper Insights • If you frequently see “ABS_OVER_CURRENT” on fast throttle changes, this can help. • Great for large inductive motors or big short bursts. How / When to Modify • If random overcurrent faults appear with no real sustained high current, enable or keep it on. • If you truly want immediate fault on any spike, keep it off. Potential Side Effects • If you rely on the absolute max to protect hardware from short, you might allow small spikes. Usually harmless for typical usage though. -------------------------------------------------- 🔹 4. THERMAL PARAMETERS -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 4.1 MOSFET Temp Cutoff Start / End Params: l_temp_fet_start, l_temp_fet_end What It Does • The ESC reduces output current once the MOSFET temperature hits “start”, fully shutting down or faulting at “end”. Deeper Insights • Default often 85°C start, 100°C end. Some hardware can go 110–120°C safely, verify specs. How / When to Modify • If you have big heatsinks or forced cooling, you can push it higher (90/110). • In hot climates or limited cooling, keep a safer margin. Potential Side Effects • Setting too high can degrade MOSFETs or let them approach meltdown. • Setting too low leads to frequent thermal throttling when it might still be safe. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 4.2 Motor Temp Cutoff Start / End Params: l_temp_motor_start, l_temp_motor_end What It Does • If the motor has a temperature sensor, it lowers motor current at start, then full fault at end. Deeper Insights • Some motors have an NTC (10k or 100k) or PTC sensor. Others have none, so these do nothing. • Typical start ~85°C, end ~100°C or 110°C, depending on magnet grade. How / When to Modify • If your motor is high-grade (120°C capable), you can set 100–120°C as the end. • Watch logs to see if you approach these thresholds.
[2025-02-24T06:24:43] francois schempers: Potential Side Effects • If set incorrectly low, you lose power even though the motor can handle more. • If set too high, you risk permanent magnet damage or winding insulation issues. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 4.3 Acceleration Temperature Decrease Param: l_temp_accel_dec What It Does • Decrease MOSFET/motor temperature limits by a percentage during acceleration, preserving some headroom for braking torque. Deeper Insights • If set to 0.15 (15%), then under acceleration, your 100°C limit effectively becomes ~85°C. Once you release acceleration, you get full limit again. How / When to Modify • If you do repeated accelerate-brake cycles and want guaranteed braking torque left, keep it around 0.15–0.2. • If you rarely need that, set 0 for no difference. Potential Side Effects • Too high = acceleration is thermally limited early, sacrificing performance. • 0 can lead to strong acceleration but no safety margin for braking if near temp limit. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 4.4 Minimum Duty Cycle / Maximum Duty Cycle Params: l_min_duty, l_max_duty What It Does • Forces a clamp on the PWM modulation ratio. For instance, max 0.95 means the ESC never hits full 100% duty. Deeper Insights • Some designs do l_max_duty=0.95 or 0.99 to avoid saturating sampling windows. • l_min_duty=0.005 is default so you can release to near zero torque. How / When to Modify • If you want maximum possible speed, set ~0.99. Check hardware stability near 100% duty. • If motor stalling issues at zero, raising l_min_duty slightly might help. Potential Side Effects • Setting max_duty=1.0 can cause issues with current sampling if your hardware can’t handle near 100% well. • High min_duty can produce a “push” at idle, not fully freewheeling. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 4.5 Maximum Wattage / Maximum Braking Wattage Params: l_watt_max, l_watt_min What It Does • A power-based limit on output or braking. Usually overshadowed by current-based limits. Deeper Insights • Some e-bike regulations want 250W or 750W nominal. This tries to enforce it, but dynamic conditions can still spike currents. • If set very high, it effectively does nothing. How / When to Modify • If local laws or personal preferences require a watt cap, set accordingly. • If you want no power-based cap, leave them near default (1.5e6 W). Potential Side Effects • Pure watt-limiting can behave oddly with partial duty cycles or hills. • If braking wattage is also limited, you might lose needed braking force. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 4.6 Max Current Scale / Min Current Scale Params: l_current_max_scale, l_current_min_scale What It Does • Multipliers that scale your current limits on-the-fly without rewriting them permanently. Deeper Insights • 1.0 means no scale. 0.5 means half your configured max or min current effectively. How / When to Modify • If you want an “eco mode” at half torque, set 0.5. • If you only run one profile, keep it 1.0. Potential Side Effects • Forgetting these are not at 1 can cause confusion about why you have low torque or weak brakes. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 4.7 Duty Cycle Current Limit Start Param: l_duty_start What It Does • At high duty cycle, the motor can approach battery voltage. This param sets at which duty fraction the ESC starts limiting current. Deeper Insights • 1.0 means no limit. If your hardware or motor saturates near 90–95% duty, you might set 0.9 so you never truly saturate. How / When to Modify • If your motor or ESC acts strangely near full duty, set 0.9 or 0.95. • If stable at 100% duty, keep it at 1.0. Potential Side Effects • Lowering it to 0.8 or 0.85 can reduce top-speed torque in that last portion of the duty range. • If you do advanced field weakening, you might keep it at 1.0 and let FW handle it. -------------------------------------------------- 🔹 5. BLDC SENSORLESS (BLDC-Mode Specific) --------------------------------------------------
[2025-02-24T06:24:43] francois schempers: Many people use FOC, so this is only relevant if you specifically run BLDC sensorless. 🔧 5.1 Minimum ERPM, Min ERPM Cycle Int Limit, Max Brake Current at Direction Change • Control how the ESC transitions to open-loop or prevents reversing at certain currents in BLDC mode. • Typically set automatically or by detection. Deeper Insights • If stuttering at low RPM, experiment with these or re-detect your motor constants. Potential Side Effects • Wrong settings can cause stalling or rough commutation at low speeds. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 5.2 Cycle Integrator Limit, Phase Advance, BEMF Coupling Params: sl_cycle_int_limit, sl_phase_advance_at_br, sl_bemf_coupling_k, etc. What They Do • Define the zero-cross detection method and commutation timing in BLDC sensorless. Deeper Insights • Usually set by detection. • If you have an unusual motor (very high KV or very low), manual tuning might help. Potential Side Effects • Incorrect values => early or late commutation => large noise, stutter, or poor efficiency. -------------------------------------------------- 🔹 6. FOC PARAMETERS -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 6.1 Current KP / KI Params: foc_current_kp, foc_current_ki What It Does • The D/Q current controller gains in FOC. • Typically found automatically by the “detection” procedure. Deeper Insights • If KP is too high, you might get overshoot or audible squeals. • If KI is too high, drifting or low-frequency hunting can occur. How / When to Modify • If detection is stable, no need to tweak. • If you see “ABS OverCurrent” or poor torque response, try lowering KP or re-running detection. Potential Side Effects • Wrong gains = serious stutter, noise, or slow current loop response. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 6.2 Zero Vector Frequency Param: foc_f_zv What It Does • The fundamental switching frequency for SVM zero vectors in FOC. • Typically 20–30 kHz to stay above audible hearing range. Deeper Insights • Going to 30 kHz can make the drive silent but raises switching losses and CPU load. • 25 kHz is a common compromise. How / When to Modify • If you hear a whine at 20 kHz, try 30 kHz. • If your hardware overheats at 30 kHz, step down to 20–25 kHz. Potential Side Effects • High f_zv => extra MOSFET heat, potential CPU overhead. • Low f_zv => audible noise. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 6.3 Dead Time Compensation Param: foc_dt_us What It Does • Compensates for the small off period between high and low MOSFET conduction. • Typically ~0.08–0.2 µs on many designs. Deeper Insights • Proper compensation yields smoother torque at low speed. • Overcompensation can cause negative torque or offset. How / When to Modify • Usually auto-detected or based on hardware suggestions. • If you suspect poor low-speed performance, tweak in small increments. Potential Side Effects • Setting it wrong => stuttering or minor torque inefficiency at very low speeds. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 6.4 Encoder Inverted / Offset / Ratio Params: foc_encoder_inverted, foc_encoder_offset, foc_encoder_ratio What It Does • For an external encoder (ABI, etc.), define orientation, offset degrees, ratio of mechanical to electrical rotations. Deeper Insights • For a 14-pole motor with an encoder on the shaft, ratio might be 7. • If the motor spins backward, toggling invert or offset can fix it. How / When to Modify • After detection, if the angle is 180° off, invert or shift offset. • If a gear is in between, set ratio accordingly. Potential Side Effects • Wrong offset or ratio => the ESC can’t track rotor, leading to stalling or rough motion. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 6.5 Sensor Mode (FOC) Param: foc_sensor_mode What It Does • For FOC, chooses “Sensorless, Encoder, Hall Sensors, HFI, VSS, 45 Deg HFI, Coupled HFI,” etc. Deeper Insights • Hall Sensors = instant start with no guess. • HFI or VSS helps sensorless start from 0 rpm if the motor has enough saliency.
[2025-02-24T06:24:43] francois schempers: How / When to Modify • If you have physical halls, choose “Hall Sensors.” • If sensorless is desired with high torque from standstill, consider 45 Deg V0V7 HFI or Coupled HFI. Potential Side Effects • HFI is more CPU-intensive and can fail if Ld≈Lq with low saliency. • Hall-based might skip if the signals are noisy at high speed. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 6.6 Speed Tracker Kp / Ki Params: foc_pll_kp, foc_pll_ki What It Does • Gains for the speed observer in FOC. Usually 2000 / 30000 by default. Deeper Insights • If you see speed readout delay or overshoot, tweak. • Usually no need to change unless advanced debugging. How / When to Modify • Double or halve them if you suspect observer “lag” or “noise.” Potential Side Effects • Overly big = speed reading hunts or flickers. • Too small = slow response in the speed estimate. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 6.7 Motor Inductance, Lq-Ld Diff, Resistance, Flux Linkage Params: foc_motor_l, foc_motor_ld_lq_diff, foc_motor_r, foc_motor_flux_linkage What It Does • Fundamental motor parameters for FOC. Usually auto-detected. Deeper Insights • For IPM motors, Ld ≠ Lq. That difference enables MTPA. • If detection is off, you get poor torque or observer misalignment. How / When to Modify • Usually detection is fine. If a weird motor, you might measure manually with “measure_res/ind” in VESC Tool. Potential Side Effects • Wrong values => stuttering, huge current spikes, or inaccurate field weakening behavior. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 6.8 Observer Gain / Slow Gain Params: foc_observer_gain, foc_observer_gain_slow What It Does • Controls how strongly the sensorless FOC observer tracks rotor angle. • If too high, overshoot. If too low, lag. Deeper Insights • Gains ~ your motor’s L, R, flux. • Lower slow gain can help at low duty cycles. How / When to Modify • If big cogging or losing sync at certain speeds, try halving the main observer_gain. • If everything is stable, no changes needed. Potential Side Effects • Not enough gain => no reliable torque at low speed. • Too much => random current or angle spikes. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 6.9 Duty Downramp Kp / Ki Params: foc_duty_dowmramp_kp, foc_duty_dowmramp_ki What It Does • In “duty cycle mode” (rare usage), prevents current overshoot when throttle is reduced quickly. Not used much in standard current control. Deeper Insights • If purely in “current control mode,” these might be irrelevant. How / When to Modify • If duty-based control is your mode, adjust to avoid big spikes on throttle release. Potential Side Effects • Overly large gains => slow speed decrease. • Too small => abrupt current surges. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 6.10 Start Current Decrease / Openloop Settings Params: foc_start_curr_dec, foc_openloop_rpm, etc. What It Does • For sensorless FOC, you can do partial open-loop at start, limiting the current to avoid saturating the observer. Deeper Insights • If your motor saturates easily at 0 rpm, a big current can ruin observer tracking. How / When to Modify • If stalling or big jerk at zero speed, set a start_curr_dec < 1 or add some openloop ramp time. • If stable, keep default. Potential Side Effects • Lower start current means weaker launches. • 1.0 means no reduction but might cause stutter at heavy load zero speed. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 6.11 MTPA Algorithm Mode Param: foc_mtpa_mode What It Does • Allows negative d-axis current for IPM motors, improving torque-per-amp. • Values: Disabled, IQ Target, IQ Measured Deeper Insights • IPM motors have Ld < Lq. MTPA can significantly boost torque. • IQ Measured can be more reactive but noisier. How / When to Modify • If you have a known IPM motor (like many QS hub motors), enable MTPA. • Try IQ Target first, or IQ Measured if transitions feel off.
[2025-02-24T06:24:44] francois schempers: Potential Side Effects • Negative d-current can raise motor’s back-EMF at sudden fault events => high bus voltage risk. • If Ld = Lq, MTPA is pointless. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 6.12 Field Weakening Params: foc_fw_current_max, foc_fw_duty_start, etc. What It Does • Injects negative d-axis current at high speed to exceed base motor speed. Increases top RPM but with caution. Deeper Insights • Great for “overdrive” ~10–30% more speed. • Watch for overvoltage if throttle is cut at high RPM. How / When to Modify • For 5–30A FW as a start, set duty_start ~0.9. • Validate logs on actual rides. Potential Side Effects • Excessive FW => bus volt spikes, MOSFET damage, or battery BMS triggers. • Motor might overheat if run at high speed heavily. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 6.13 Speed Tracker Position Source Param: foc_speed_soure What It Does • Position source for the speed trackers: “Corrected Position” vs. “Observer” only. Deeper Insights • If you have sensors or HFI, corrected uses that data. • Observer might drift slightly at 0 speed but can be smoother at high speed. How / When to Modify • If you see speed bounce from sensor noise, pick “Observer.” • If observer lags at very low speed, “Corrected” might help. Potential Side Effects • With poor sensor data, “Corrected” can degrade. • “Observer” alone might have small offset at near-zero. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 6.14 Short Low-Side FETs on Zero Duty Param: foc_short_ls_on_zero_duty What It Does • When duty=0 in FOC, the ESC can short the motor windings via the low-side MOSFETs or leave them open. Deeper Insights • Shorting can create mild braking torque at zero & reduce driver power. • Leaving them open gives freewheel. How / When to Modify • If you want less rolling at 0 throttle, enable short. • If you want free coasting, disable. Potential Side Effects • Could concentrate heat on the low-side MOSFETs. • Slight drag if short is active. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 6.15 Overmodulation Factor Param: foc_overmod_factor What It Does • Allows SVM to exceed 100% modulation, e.g., hexagonal wave up to 1.15. Gains slight speed without full field weakening. Deeper Insights • 1.0–1.15 typical. • 1.15 approaches trapezoidal-like conduction at high speed. How / When to Modify • If you want a small top-speed bump, try 1.05–1.10. • At 1.0, no overmod. Potential Side Effects • Slightly rougher waveforms = more motor heat or noise at top speed. -------------------------------------------------- 🔹 7. SPEED & POSITION PID -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 7.1 PID Loop Rate Param: sp_pid_loop_rate What It Does • Rate for position & speed controllers. Values: 25Hz to 10000Hz. Deeper Insights • Higher = more CPU load but faster response. • 250–1000Hz is typical for e-scooter. How / When to Modify • If speed-limiting feels laggy, increase. • If CPU is overwhelmed, reduce. Potential Side Effects • Too high => stuttering if CPU can’t keep up. • Too low => slow reaction to load changes. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 7.2 Speed PID Kp, Ki, Kd, Filter Params: s_pid_kp, s_pid_ki, s_pid_kd, s_pid_kd_filter What It Does • The speed controller in VESC, layered over the current controller. Deeper Insights • Usually small because the underlying current loop is already fast. • High Kp can overshoot or surge around target speed. How / When to Modify • If you see big oscillations near set speed, reduce Kp or add Kd. • If it’s too slow to respond to hills, raise Kp/Ki carefully. Potential Side Effects • Excessive gains => jerkiness or noise. • Too low => sluggish speed corrections. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 7.3 Minimum ERPM, Allow Braking, Ramp eRPM Params: s_pid_min_erpm, s_pid_allow_braking, s_pid_ramp_erpms_s What It Does • Additional rules for speed control: no speed PID below min ERPM, whether braking is permitted, how fast the speed reference can ramp.
[2025-02-24T06:24:44] francois schempers: Deeper Insights • If allow_braking is off, the speed controller never commands negative torque. • Ramp_erpms_s is how quickly the speed setpoint can climb. How / When to Modify • For typical e-scooter usage, keep braking on. • If you want a soft spool-up in speed mode, define a ramp limit (e.g., 25000 erpms/s). Potential Side Effects • Disabling braking in speed PID = no slowing under speed commands, coasts downhill. • Overly small ramp => slow acceleration requests from the speed loop. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 7.4 Speed Source Param: s_pid_speed_source What It Does • PLL vs. Fast / Faster Estimator for deriving speed in the speed PID. Deeper Insights • PLL is stable but slightly slower. • Fast or Faster can be more immediate but noisier. How / When to Modify • If you want crisp speed-limiting and can handle some noise, pick fast. • If you prefer stable readouts, pick PLL. Potential Side Effects • Too noisy => torque oscillations or speed readout jitter. • Too slow => mild speed-limiting lag. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 7.5 Position PID Params: p_pid_kp, p_pid_ki, p_pid_kd, etc. What It Does • For servo-like position control applications. Less common for e-scooters. Deeper Insights • Typically used in robotics/CNC. • If you only do speed or current control, you may ignore this. Potential Side Effects • Overly high gains => severe oscillations. • Usually not relevant for normal PEV usage. -------------------------------------------------- 🔹 8. CURRENT CONTROL (BLDC/DC) -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 8.1 Startup Boost Param: cc_startup_boost_duty What It Does • In BLDC/DC current control, it’s the minimum duty fraction when throttle is first engaged, to ensure some torque at zero speed. Deeper Insights • If 0.02, you get a mild “jump.” • Too high and it can jerk from standstill. How / When to Modify • If your motor has trouble launching from zero, raise slightly. • If you want gentler starts, lower it. Potential Side Effects • Too big => unstoppable jump from standstill. • Too small => possible stalling under load. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 8.2 Minimum Current Param: cc_min_current What It Does • The threshold below which the ESC stops driving in BLDC/DC current mode, effectively releasing the motor. Deeper Insights • If set 0.1A, you might have a small idle hold. • If 0.01, it’s basically free-coasting under that level. How / When to Modify • If you want a bit of “hold” at near-zero throttle, raise. • If you want full freewheel, keep it very low. Potential Side Effects • Larger min current wastes energy or creates mild forward push at minimal throttle. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 8.3 cc_gain, cc_ramp_step_max • Additional BLDC/DC current control parameters for ramping the duty cycle under load. • Typically 0.0046 for cc_gain, 0.04 for cc_ramp_step_max. Deeper Insights • If you have a super low inductance motor, you might reduce cc_gain. • If acceleration is jerky, tweak ramp_step. Potential Side Effects • Wrong gain => overshoot or sluggish throttle response in BLDC/DC mode. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 8.4 Fault Stop Time / Duty Ramp Step Params: m_fault_stop_time_ms, m_duty_ramp_step What It Does • How long the motor is disabled after a fault. • The max ramp step in duty mode for BLDC/DC. Deeper Insights • Typical fault stop is 500 ms. • If you want quick auto-recovery, you can reduce it. Potential Side Effects • Too short => repeated fault triggers rapidly. • Too long => annoying downtime if a minor fault occurs. -------------------------------------------------- 🔹 9. ENCODERS & SENSOR PORTS -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 9.1 Encoder Counts, Sin/Cos Gains, Offsets • For advanced encoders: specify amplitude ~1.0, offsets ~1.65 V for sin/cos, etc. • If you see weird offset, correct it here.
[2025-02-24T06:24:44] francois schempers: Potential Side Effects • Wrong offset => angle errors, stutter. • Wrong amplitude => poor angle resolution. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 9.2 Sensor Port Mode Param: m_sensor_port_mode What It Does • Mode for the sensor port: Hall, ABI, AS5047, Sin/Cos, TS5700N8501, BISSC, etc. Deeper Insights • Must match your physical sensor wiring or you get garbage signals. Potential Side Effects • If you pick AS5047 but physically have halls, no reading. • Some sensors need advanced or different wiring. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 9.3 Invert Motor Direction Param: m_invert_direction What It Does • Flips the commanded direction in software. Alternative to swapping two motor phases physically. Deeper Insights • Great if detection found reversed rotation or if dual-motor setups need opposite directions on front vs. rear. Potential Side Effects • If you rely on directional logic for braking or reversing, ensure you also account for inverted direction. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 9.4 DRV8301 OC Mode / DRV8301 OC Adjustment • For DRV8301-based hardware, define how hardware overcurrent protection is triggered or latched. • Usually "Current Limit" is standard. Potential Side Effects • If the oc_adj is set too low, you get easy fault triggers. • If too high, real shorts might not be interrupted fast enough. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 9.5 Min/Max Switching Frequency in BLDC Params: m_bldc_f_sw_min, m_bldc_f_sw_max What It Does • If using adaptive switching in BLDC, it can move between min & max freq. Deeper Insights • Default range ~3 kHz to 35 kHz. • Lower freq => audible noise, higher => more heat in MOSFETs. Potential Side Effects • Too high freq on old boards => driver errors or MOSFET overheating. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 9.6 Beta Value for Motor Thermistor, etc. Param: m_ntc_motor_beta, m_ptc_motor_coeff, etc. What It Does • If the motor has an NTC or PTC sensor, set the correct beta or coefficient. • Some motors use KTY or PT1000. Potential Side Effects • Wrong sensor settings => inaccurate temperature reading => poor thermal throttling. -------------------------------------------------- 🔹 10. BMS SETTINGS -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 10.1 BMS Type Param: bms.type What It Does • If using a CAN-based “VESC BMS,” you can unify data. If none, ignore. Deeper Insights • “None” means the ESC ignores BMS comm. • “VESC BMS” uses messages from the official hardware or similar. Potential Side Effects • If incorrectly enabled, you might see spurious limiting if no real BMS data is present. -------------------------------------------------- 🔧 10.2 BMS Limit Mode, Temperature Limit, SOC, VCell Min/Max Params under bms.* What It Does • The ESC can reduce current smoothly based on battery’s temperature, SOC, or cell voltages from the BMS over CAN. Deeper Insights • Overtemp or low SOC => input current is scaled down. • This prevents abrupt BMS cut at cell-level constraints. How / When to Modify • If you have an advanced BMS that shares data, set these for gentle limiting. • If your BMS is standalone or simple, these do nothing. Potential Side Effects • If BMS data is invalid or missing, the ESC might clamp power incorrectly. • Misconfigured voltage or SOC limits can hamper performance or cause weird cutouts. -------------------------------------------------- # WRAP-UP & FINAL NOTES • Always Start with Detection: Let the firmware auto-detect motor parameters (R, L, flux, hall table, etc.). • Test in Steps: Increase or adjust current limits incrementally, watching temperature logs. • Thermal & Voltage Headroom: Large negative braking or field weakening can produce bus voltage spikes. Ensure safety margins.
[2025-02-24T06:24:44] francois schempers: • Hall vs Sensorless vs HFI: - Hall = simpler immediate start, - Sensorless/HFI = advanced but can be just as good if tuned well, - Keep an eye on noise or offset at high speeds. • Smart BMS: If you have a CAN-based BMS, you can coordinate battery info for smooth limiting. If not, the ESC only sees battery voltage and can’t individually protect cell groups. Ride Safely and enjoy the benefits of a finely tuned VESC-based controller. If something behaves oddly, revert to your last known stable config. Detailed logs are your friend!

[2025-02-24T15:54:53] Finn: Thats a lot for that motor
[2025-02-24T15:55:06] Finn: Flipsky moment?
[2025-02-24T15:59:58] Patrick: Pro2 motor?
[2025-02-24T16:00:08] Patrick: Or what
[2025-02-24T16:00:21] Patrick: Cause the resistance is insane low
[2025-02-24T16:00:36] Patrick: I have 13mOhm but with a delta 65H...
[2025-02-24T16:00:47] Chen Simhony: Pro 2 motor
[2025-02-24T16:01:03] Chen Simhony: Flipsky 75100
[2025-02-24T16:01:24] Patrick: Wait i think i still have mp2 values from pro2 motor
[2025-02-24T16:02:31] Chen Simhony: Ok
[2025-02-24T16:04:15] Patrick: <photos/photo_21649@24-02-2025_16-04-15.jpg>
[2025-02-24T16:04:30] Patrick: This was still from the false Firmware i had on the mp2
[2025-02-24T16:04:41] Patrick: Idk if the values changed from the detection with the other firmware
[2025-02-24T16:05:09] Patrick: Would try these values though when doing the detection the motor worked normal
[2025-02-24T16:06:21] Chen Simhony: Wil do im on 6.02 no limit
[2025-02-24T16:06:26] Chen Simhony: Thanks
[2025-02-24T16:06:33] Patrick: R: 44.22mOhm, L: 99.6t, Lq-LD: 11.65, weird A : 9.6u8mh/b, KP, 0.0997, KI: 44.22
[2025-02-24T16:06:44] Chen Simhony: Need to figure out if solder the sensors correctly 😔
[2025-02-24T16:07:02] Unknown: Thats a 12 right?

[2025-02-24T19:02:13] puneDir: 25
[2025-02-24T19:02:27] puneDir: I have 3 Of them
[2025-02-24T19:04:01] haku: rewind em good idea. if i just knew how i would too
[2025-02-24T19:35:06] GABE: you can know how it's just after you're finished that it doesn't work properly
[2025-02-24T19:35:14] GABE: One wrong weave and it's fucked I think
[2025-02-24T19:35:34] haku: you know i believe everything you say.
[2025-02-24T19:35:35] GABE: yeah definitely
[2025-02-24T19:35:52] GABE: Waste 24 hours winding then it doesn't work because of one fuckup
[2025-02-24T19:36:16] haku: you need to be high functioning like me.
[2025-02-24T19:36:37] GABE: waterproofing the Ebike today and going on a spin
[2025-02-24T19:36:43] GABE: Couldn't go out yesterday it rained
[2025-02-24T19:36:46] haku: what is IR
[2025-02-24T19:36:52] GABE: I'll check when I get home
[2025-02-24T19:36:56] haku: how many times must i ask
[2025-02-24T19:36:59] GABE: take the chain off and run motor detection
[2025-02-24T19:37:06] GABE: yeee I'll show
[2025-02-24T19:37:08] haku: no need.
[2025-02-24T19:37:21] haku: its on a freewheel isnt it?
[2025-02-24T19:37:57] haku: your right take it off
[2025-02-24T19:40:00] GABE: need on this bike.
[2025-02-24T19:40:14] GABE: Surprised the chain hasn't snapped tbf
[2025-02-24T19:40:19] haku: yes agreed
[2025-02-24T19:40:21] GABE: I push 100a phase
[2025-02-24T19:40:25] GABE: 75 cont
[2025-02-24T19:40:30] GABE: almost throws me off
[2025-02-24T19:40:33] haku: i forgot motor detect goes reverse
[2025-02-24T19:40:33] GABE: i gotta lean forward
[2025-02-24T19:40:57] haku: no motor heat?
[2025-02-24T19:41:00] GABE: I raped it at 50a and the shell was cold But also Ebike motors have better cooling
[2025-02-24T19:41:02] GABE: Fuck all
[2025-02-24T19:41:05] GABE: Shell is cold 247
[2025-02-24T19:41:09] haku: wow
[2025-02-24T19:41:15] haku: i wonder what motor they use
[2025-02-24T19:41:21] GABE: There's a whirlwind at the shell so perhaps it has ultimate cooling
[2025-02-24T19:41:24] haku: jetson shit motor
[2025-02-24T19:41:33] GABE: <photos/photo_21653@24-02-2025_19-41-33.jpg>
[2025-02-24T19:41:41] GABE: this can't be that one
[2025-02-24T19:41:46] GABE: it's too good
[2025-02-24T19:41:51] haku: it looks like the same as the pedal jetsons
[2025-02-24T19:42:00] GABE: can't wait to check ir
[2025-02-24T19:42:18] GABE: the wheel fins are technically a heatsink
[2025-02-24T19:42:21] GABE: it's all one metal mass
[2025-02-24T19:42:21] haku: pedaled vs non pedal jetson has different motors
[2025-02-24T19:42:50] haku: have you opened and measured magnet mm?
[2025-02-24T19:42:54] GABE: I'm gonna go on a drive with 100a phase.
[2025-02-24T19:42:58] GABE: I don't wanna open that shite
[2025-02-24T19:43:20] GABE: Pedaling when accelerating = Rocket
[2025-02-24T19:43:22] GABE: btw
[2025-02-24T19:43:26] GABE: Pedal assist
[2025-02-24T19:43:26] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-02-24T19:43:38] haku: how you wire pedal assist?
[2025-02-24T19:44:28] haku: ive seen this model fiido before. i just dont like the folding mechanism in the middle. how light is it?
[2025-02-24T19:45:05] Arnau Martinez Casals: How can i solve this
[2025-02-24T19:45:39] GABE: I didn't
[2025-02-24T19:45:39] Arnau Martinez Casals: I can t see anything
[2025-02-24T19:46:00] GABE: It just helps it push along because sensorless but I noticed it works when accelerating also
[2025-02-24T19:46:08] Arnau Martinez Casals: How can i solve this
[2025-02-24T19:46:09] GABE: Gotta be careful cos it can flip you over
[2025-02-24T19:46:25] Arnau Martinez Casals: Cant see anything
[2025-02-24T19:46:39] GABE: I forgot my crystal ball at home.
[2025-02-24T19:47:01] Arnau Martinez Casals: Video charging
[2025-02-24T19:47:19] Arnau Martinez Casals: <video_file>
[2025-02-24T19:47:58] haku: adjust your computer display settings
[2025-02-24T19:48:09] Arnau Martinez Casals: How?
[2025-02-24T19:48:13] GABE: 70a phase no saturation issues.
[2025-02-24T19:48:53] haku: i forgot tbh. i think right click on windows then go to display settings
[2025-02-24T20:08:23] Rose: Hey there Artem, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-02-24T20:15:01] Yamal: I better keep quiet, otherwise more than one person will start crying xD
[2025-02-24T20:18:01] haku: let em cry. words are just that my boy. they cant hurt us
[2025-02-24T20:57:55] Yamal: If I say G2 o zt3 ?
[2025-02-24T20:58:28] haku: ive seen a zt3 here in the hood. the headlight looks cool
[2025-02-24T20:58:47] haku: but a bit too bulky
[2025-02-24T21:00:01] Yamal: Nice words xD bulky””
[2025-02-24T21:02:52] haku: its fat. needs to go on a diet
[2025-02-24T21:02:58] haku: there i said it
[2025-02-24T21:03:33] Yamal: is he more fat than strong?
[2025-02-24T21:04:16] Yamal: It’s like “bull terrier or “” bull
[2025-02-24T21:06:30] haku: lets just say. theres excess plastic
[2025-02-24T21:07:09] haku: needs to be trimmed a bit
[2025-02-24T21:07:09] Yamal: Battery box look metal
[2025-02-24T21:07:21] Yamal: But I don’t know ..
[2025-02-24T21:07:34] haku: i didnt inspect that close
[2025-02-24T21:33:21] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/CLVjfOByWac?si=T6KH3oE9PusWgMH1
[2025-02-24T21:35:47] haku: i didnt know you can do that to scooter tires. cool
[2025-02-24T21:40:14] Yamal: Very good hehe
[2025-02-24T21:41:09] haku: have you tried the gasoline bead method?
[2025-02-24T21:41:13] Yamal: I want to try split ring tubeless tires
[2025-02-24T21:41:24] Yamal: No..
[2025-02-24T21:41:43] haku: good stuff. i dont know why you didnt get ly ones
[2025-02-24T21:42:02] Yamal: Expensive man
[2025-02-24T21:42:12] Yamal: Like 150$ 1
[2025-02-24T21:42:19] haku: what rim you using? the expensive custom ones?
[2025-02-24T21:42:20] Yamal: 2=300..
[2025-02-24T21:42:30] Yamal: Really don’t know yet
[2025-02-24T21:42:40] haku: rim is $100 for 11
[2025-02-24T21:42:41] Yamal: But 300€
[2025-02-24T21:42:46] haku: ok
[2025-02-24T21:42:59] Yamal: Never see that price..
[2025-02-24T21:43:07] haku: back then
[2025-02-24T21:43:18] haku: 2023
[2025-02-24T21:43:31] haku: 12 is 110 and 13 is 120
[2025-02-24T21:43:33] Yamal: Anyway I talk with them
[2025-02-24T21:43:58] Yamal: And the minimum size inside |<>| 80mm
[2025-02-24T21:44:02] Yamal: Too big ..
[2025-02-24T21:44:23] haku: tubeless split rim is so convinient but i dont mind changing normal tubless
[2025-02-24T21:45:21] haku: too bad i cant even use my motors atm
[2025-02-24T21:46:15] Yamal: Need to repair soon
[2025-02-24T21:46:25] Yamal: Big monster for fun
[2025-02-24T21:46:38] haku: easy repair. its the tuning i need help
[2025-02-24T21:46:49] Yamal: Tuning ?
[2025-02-24T21:46:56] haku: yea vesc tuning
[2025-02-24T21:46:59] Yamal: Programming?
[2025-02-24T21:47:18] haku: im giving it too much amps i think. something is wrong if i killed 2 vescs at the same time
[2025-02-24T21:47:35] haku: vesc not even hot
[2025-02-24T21:47:54] haku: maybe cuttoff im not sure
[2025-02-24T21:48:06] Yamal: I am clear that I will not drive the 80 h until a teacher gives me the green light to do so.
[2025-02-24T21:48:30] Yamal: I planing use the same A…
[2025-02-24T21:48:46] haku: just use it. we dont need the green light.
[2025-02-24T21:48:46] Yamal: Lower battery I think..
[2025-02-24T21:48:53] Yamal: But A phase same 300
[2025-02-24T21:48:57] haku: yes hopefully
[2025-02-24T21:49:05] haku: we will see
[2025-02-24T21:49:38] haku: i prolly wont have it cutoff next time
[2025-02-24T21:50:47] haku: raise battery charging cuttof maybe
[2025-02-24T21:51:22] Yamal: What I mean is that I prefer to wait a bit and make sure that the programming is optimal and safe before breaking anything hastily.
[2025-02-24T21:51:50] haku: just run it with what your battery can push
[2025-02-24T21:52:23] haku: 200a battery per motor maybe
[2025-02-24T21:52:42] haku: ask an expert
[2025-02-24T21:56:55] Yamal: I really plan on not going above the rated v..
[2025-02-24T21:57:05] haku: we sitdown today. guaranteed. blasted my legs
[2025-02-24T21:57:08] Yamal: Like my nominal it’s 350A
[2025-02-24T21:57:17] Yamal: 175A per controller
[2025-02-24T21:57:26] Yamal: For good life to my cells..
[2025-02-24T21:57:29] haku: nice
[2025-02-24T21:57:53] haku: good idea
[2025-02-24T21:58:03] Yamal: Yo can run 200A right
[2025-02-24T21:58:15] haku: 250 per esc once
[2025-02-24T21:58:27] haku: my first set of spintends
[2025-02-24T21:58:29] Yamal: I see
[2025-02-24T21:58:34] Yamal: Very good
[2025-02-24T21:58:44] haku: 300 phase
[2025-02-24T21:58:45] Yamal: 500A battery
[2025-02-24T21:58:51] haku: yea
[2025-02-24T21:59:00] Yamal: Imagine the peak ? Hehe
[2025-02-24T21:59:02] haku: cutoff at 510 i think
[2025-02-24T21:59:23] haku: it was good man. just needed proper cooling
[2025-02-24T21:59:51] haku: i wont go above 45a per cell on p42
[2025-02-24T22:00:27] haku: some people have balls. im not that big balls when it comes to cells
[2025-02-24T22:00:41] Yamal: You have time to mount a good heatsink, that's all
[2025-02-24T22:01:22] haku: agreed need custom enclosure though if i want it looking clean
[2025-02-24T22:02:13] haku: i will not spend on that
[2025-02-24T22:02:14] Yamal: Maybe you could also eat some more salad, so as not to burden Spintend so much.
[2025-02-24T22:02:30] haku: at that point the fardriver demons will win
[2025-02-24T22:02:47] haku: lol
[2025-02-24T22:02:54] haku: veggies are for pussies
[2025-02-24T22:02:57] Yamal: Why man
[2025-02-24T22:03:20] haku: no dude. its a cheap ass frame
[2025-02-24T22:03:40] haku: generic china frame seated laotie
[2025-02-24T22:03:41] Yamal: Yes but need cooling solution
[2025-02-24T22:03:54] Yamal: You have nice battery/controller/ engines
[2025-02-24T22:03:59] Yamal: Just do it
[2025-02-24T22:04:07] haku: watercool maybe
[2025-02-24T22:04:14] haku: we will see
[2025-02-24T22:04:48] Yamal: or even a Mexican who fans you
[2025-02-24T22:05:51] haku: i love mexicans dude. but some of them that raise the mexican flag can stay in mexico
[2025-02-24T22:06:32] haku: in this country you fly the red white and blue
[2025-02-24T22:07:15] Yamal: Why do you say this? I mean a pretty young girl who will fan your controllers after burning the tires
[2025-02-24T22:07:48] haku: that be cool.. not too young and aslong as she flies the right colors were good
[2025-02-24T22:08:00] haku: she can pay for my meals
[2025-02-24T22:08:32] Yamal: Cool imagine ?
[2025-02-24T22:08:51] Yamal: Cooling solution and free food xD
[2025-02-24T22:09:17] haku: right now focused on raising a man.
[2025-02-24T22:09:22] haku: cant be distracted
[2025-02-24T22:09:40] Yamal: And all this without taking off your sunglasses! You are a real cowboy.
[2025-02-24T22:09:46] haku: a man that will save gotham someday
[2025-02-24T22:10:17] haku: sunglasses is needed in my city
[2025-02-24T22:12:26] haku: too bright also blue polarized lenses is good imo
[2025-02-24T22:13:33] Yamal: lentils?
[2025-02-24T22:14:58] haku: <video_file>
[2025-02-24T22:15:55] haku: im a crosseyed chink
[2025-02-24T22:18:56] haku: you still love me yamal?
[2025-02-24T22:19:10] Yamal: 😂
[2025-02-24T22:20:25] Yamal: my respects
[2025-02-24T22:20:55] Yamal: haku rider strikes back,,
[2025-02-24T22:21:50] haku: its not to shield my eyes. its to shield your eyes from my eyes
[2025-02-24T22:22:10] haku: you understand the logic there?
[2025-02-24T22:23:04] Yamal: Don't go looking for jealous women, have 7 at once without any of them knowing, when your life is in danger, flee to Asia
[2025-02-24T22:23:46] haku: no women can look me in the eye and say i love your eyes
[2025-02-24T22:24:06] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Still fucking 🥶❄️❄️❄️❄️❄️🥶
[2025-02-24T22:25:30] haku: dont mean to brag but 24c here. too hot honestly
[2025-02-24T22:25:31] Yamal: What's wrong with your eyes, man? You've limited yourself to looking at your nose to make fun of it. Bruce Lee had the same eyes and they called him "the Asian tiger"😂
[2025-02-24T22:26:27] haku: call me the tiger king then if we comparing to bruce lee
[2025-02-24T22:27:52] Yamal: Speaking of Asia, the hobbit is returning to Asian Monaco right now, but only for a few days.
[2025-02-24T22:28:17] haku: where is asian monaco?
[2025-02-24T22:28:29] Yamal: Singapore;)
[2025-02-24T22:28:36] haku: thats right! nice
[2025-02-24T22:30:19] Yamal: When I return I disappear like the illusionist, time for family or sleeping on the street XD
[2025-02-24T22:30:50] haku: family time very important. need balance
[2025-02-24T22:35:32] Yamal: Still okay the scooter ?
[2025-02-24T22:36:51] Yamal: I mean it’s finish ?
[2025-02-24T22:36:53] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Waiting for a spacer to get printed
[2025-02-24T22:37:25] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And maybe I'll wait for 85240(currently have 85150 and 75200)
[2025-02-24T22:37:47] Yamal: You can fit two 85/240?
[2025-02-24T22:38:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes I can but my wallet can't 😉
[2025-02-24T22:38:09] francois schempers: solve what ?
[2025-02-24T22:38:35] Yamal: You have 85/150 x2?

[2025-02-25T04:28:37] Noname: 180,000$ no
[2025-02-25T04:31:41] haku: what materials do you use it for
[2025-02-25T04:31:47] haku: why so expensive?
[2025-02-25T04:32:20] haku: stainless steel okay to cut?
[2025-02-25T04:55:40] Noname: German one was like 800k. Mainly stainless, galvanized, aluminum, steel basically any metal up to like 3/4"
[2025-02-25T04:58:33] Noname: Ours is the cheap Chinese one we don't need super accuracy or anything crazy. Using a 30yr old cnc punch until now
[2025-02-25T05:20:19] Jason: aaa too HOOOOOT
[2025-02-25T05:49:46] haku: wow. pretty thick
[2025-02-25T07:19:54] Yamal: Good morning, how are you? Do you use the Github application or the website directly?
[2025-02-25T07:23:00] Yamal: https://youtube.com/shorts/PkpyDlAFENo?si=IVhFblUZZ1A5IdrO
[2025-02-25T07:23:15] Yamal: XD be careful
[2025-02-25T07:44:35] Arnau Martinez Casals: <photos/photo_21662@25-02-2025_07-44-35.jpg>
[2025-02-25T07:45:13] Arnau Martinez Casals: Too happy with results 60v 150fase 80 batery
[2025-02-25T07:49:58] Arnau Martinez Casals: No fieldweaking only mpta
[2025-02-25T08:02:58] Yamal: Nami Bombadil
[2025-02-25T08:59:31] Jan: That was a really painful part to design. There is like not a single straight line for reference
[2025-02-25T09:13:29] Smart Repair: yes, I think so.. But it turned out well 👍
[2025-02-25T10:55:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: How bad is a backwards tire ?
[2025-02-25T11:07:37] francois schempers: Well instead of guiding water outside, you send it right in the middle
[2025-02-25T11:31:13] Jason: fun happens after
[2025-02-25T11:31:33] Jason: tire hydroplanes and slips
[2025-02-25T11:31:42] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-02-25T11:38:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So in summer not that problematic?
[2025-02-25T11:52:56] francois schempers: same goes for debris and dirt but yes less problematic
[2025-02-25T12:17:15] Давно пора: On moto front tyre almost always backwards
[2025-02-25T12:55:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: My rear is backwards
[2025-02-25T14:01:28] Yamal: https://youtu.be/9B-Xt6l8GlQ?si=O6TNnikcNnhII67k
[2025-02-25T16:24:42] haku: you designed this?
[2025-02-25T16:25:22] haku: oh yea thats right i remember the orange prototype
[2025-02-25T16:26:43] haku: i like that halmet. what is that looks like astonaut
[2025-02-25T16:27:59] haku: my peak g30v2 minibmx will be superior and smaller than this
[2025-02-25T16:32:00] Jan: Was part of the GT2 platform push
[2025-02-25T16:33:05] Jan: GT2 has a great steering geometry, great space, but it has a weak main bearing on the stem and the axles need quite some work to fit bigger motors
[2025-02-25T16:33:22] haku: you also coded that rasberry pi?
[2025-02-25T16:33:29] Jan: No
[2025-02-25T16:33:32] haku: i see
[2025-02-25T16:33:47] Jan: I dont like to code at all. I only wrote the code for the JREV light system
[2025-02-25T16:33:51] haku: do you thing the new gt3 fixed this issue?
[2025-02-25T16:34:10] Jan: I havent looked into the new 3 series from segway yet
[2025-02-25T17:25:20] 'lekrsu': The GT3 is just a 48V scooter with a G3/F3/E3/ZT3Pro controller inside. Different front suspension to the GT3 Pro as hell. Smaller bay. Tube frame 😭, they are for sale already right?
[2025-02-25T17:26:13] 'lekrsu': GT3 Pro seems to have a significantly deeper chassi, would be important for any modding. Completely different hardware to the GT3, waiting for controller pics 👀 Still a tube frame.
[2025-02-25T17:26:29] Yamal: But there are 72v version or I dream
[2025-02-25T17:26:36] 'lekrsu': Yes, the GT3 Pro is 72V.
[2025-02-25T17:26:43] Yamal: Nice
[2025-02-25T17:26:54] Yamal: Also no so so expensive
[2025-02-25T17:26:54] 'lekrsu': Better if it was 0V so we'd save money for an eventual purchase.
[2025-02-25T17:27:05] 'lekrsu': Isn't it thousands of euros for the Pro?
[2025-02-25T17:27:20] Yamal: …
[2025-02-25T17:27:38] Yamal: Normal g3 around 900€
[2025-02-25T17:28:11] 'lekrsu': G3 is a complete Aluminium chassi in comparison
[2025-02-25T17:29:23] 'lekrsu': The base model GT3 is already launched at 1700 USD
[2025-02-25T17:30:49] Yamal: 900= single …
[2025-02-25T17:31:05] Yamal: https://www.imoveblue.es/patinetes-electricos-certificados-dgt/1472-ninebot-max-g3.html
[2025-02-25T17:31:07] 'lekrsu': Wdym? G3 isn't GT3 or anything
[2025-02-25T17:31:22] Yamal: G3 single
[2025-02-25T17:31:33] Yamal: And dual
[2025-02-25T17:31:46] 'lekrsu': GT3 is also single innit
[2025-02-25T17:32:15] Yamal: You say it’s good scooter frame ..?
[2025-02-25T17:32:49] 'lekrsu': For double the price of a G3, you get a less appealing frame with almost the same hardware. :D
[2025-02-25T17:33:32] 'lekrsu': Hopefully, compared to the G2, the G3 is aluminium instead of steel, improved rear suspension and a non-faulty front suspension.
[2025-02-25T17:33:44] 'lekrsu': But the exact usable dimensions xyz inside, no idea.
[2025-02-25T17:35:19] 'lekrsu': https://www.youtube.com/shorts/HiAMehDaIPQ
[2025-02-25T17:35:25] 'lekrsu': Here's the only video I've seen inside
[2025-02-25T17:35:25] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. 'lekrsu' has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-02-25T17:35:54] Yamal: Can you imagine a g3 with hope tech4v4?
[2025-02-25T17:36:59] Yamal: Pretty nice , very clean
[2025-02-25T17:38:39] 'lekrsu': Like custom brakes front and back? Their support team won't enjoy all the bent disc brakes the upcoming years.
[2025-02-25T17:38:57] Yamal: Of course
[2025-02-25T17:39:13] Yamal: Molimoli and x12
[2025-02-25T17:39:31] Yamal: Need to know size open fork
[2025-02-25T17:39:38] Yamal: 11” engines right ?
[2025-02-25T17:40:42] 'lekrsu': Yes, for some reason they are. 7.5" rim though, cursed. Hopefully wider base dropout than G2.
[2025-02-25T17:42:06] Yamal: I still haven't seen the dual for sale in Spain, only the single, the good thing is that they are all certified and approved, that is, it is legal today and after 2027, and this is important
[2025-02-25T17:42:38] 'lekrsu': GT3 Pro is not for sale yet, but they wont be approved in most countries, yet still sold for private land use. 80 km/h, one model, no regional ones.
[2025-02-25T17:45:38] Yamal: you know you're going to buy it
[2025-02-25T17:47:46] Yamal: okay I was confused,, g3 single gt3pro dual
[2025-02-25T17:53:35] Yamal: https://youtu.be/ekhfI-VbDRc?si=GNRNm39HPC9MyYsl
[2025-02-25T17:56:58] 'lekrsu': Likely above 3k€ so eh, pass haha
[2025-02-25T18:04:56] Yamal: https://youtu.be/gqixGsNy2zE?si=aee1hvmmAD95zjZY

[2025-02-25T18:14:16] Yamal: This haku hides something from us and does not say who he really is
[2025-02-25T18:14:20] Yamal: 🤓

[2025-02-25T18:21:57] haku: first thing ill do is not pay off debt but buy 2 used surrons
[2025-02-25T18:22:38] haku: they cutting off some govt spending bullshit and giving it to the people

[2025-02-25T18:23:20] Yamal: Or every month
[2025-02-25T18:24:04] haku: one time. im not to sure on details
[2025-02-25T18:24:18] Yamal: we live in the jungle

[2025-02-25T21:11:32] GABE: sensorless is bad
[2025-02-25T21:12:02] haku: balls to walls but focus. use your high functioning powers
[2025-02-25T21:13:42] haku: this is how i imagine our trip to sweden will be like @jamaludin_algarnati https://youtu.be/uiaRYQlsjy4?si=bnVeBdVrbPXVeeVu

[2025-02-25T21:21:56] haku: the minibike scene was the best
[2025-02-25T22:30:10] Awyba: Hey guys, I’m looking to build a new scooter since I sold my Pro 2 a few months ago. Been riding the Talaria Sting R instead, which is plenty of fun, but a scooter just hits different, so I want one again. Haven’t decided on a base yet, most important for me is good handling and a platform that’s easy to upgrade without having to mess too much with the body.
[2025-02-25T22:31:03] Jan: G30
[2025-02-25T22:32:48] Dualtron Achilleus: Is there any parameter that affect torque att the begining, like reduce or higher it?
[2025-02-25T22:38:22] haku: my brothers in vesc. its mind boggling to me that dual mini spintend just uses a single xt90 when its dual 100a
[2025-02-25T22:38:43] haku: what is the real rating for this little guy?
[2025-02-25T22:39:20] haku: vesc your talaria. 72v it
[2025-02-25T22:42:38] Awyba: already mounted a c700 to it but running stock battery, can pull 11kw out of it instead of 8kw stock
[2025-02-25T22:42:58] haku: there you go. battery and motor next
[2025-02-25T22:43:07] haku: where you from?
[2025-02-25T22:43:19] Awyba: Germany
[2025-02-25T22:43:52] Awyba: looking foward to it but its not quite cheap haha
[2025-02-25T22:44:11] haku: sting r has a bigger battery bay than light bee yea? should be able to fit more cells
[2025-02-25T22:44:49] Awyba: maybe a little bit bigger but not that much
[2025-02-25T22:45:07] haku: wich version sting R you have?
[2025-02-25T22:45:35] Awyba: what do you mean?
[2025-02-25T22:45:44] haku: mark 3 4 or 5?
[2025-02-25T22:45:48] Awyba: mx4
[2025-02-25T22:46:39] haku: good bike. but yea if you want portablility i would go with a g30 scooter.
[2025-02-25T22:47:02] haku: or get big ones like nami and dualtrons.
[2025-02-25T22:47:36] Awyba: Yeah i would keep the Talaria for sure but i would also like riding a scooter again
[2025-02-25T22:48:05] haku: talaria street legal in germany?
[2025-02-25T22:49:22] Awyba: yes there is a L1e version thats like a 50cc limited to 45 kmh and a L3e version which is like 125cc without speed limit but both have the same power
[2025-02-25T22:49:32] Awyba: but mine is not legal anymore xD
[2025-02-25T22:49:53] haku: oh i see. very cool. they wont check though wont they
[2025-02-25T22:52:14] Awyba: They do speed checks some times not for electric bikes only they do that in general because you have to get a motorcycle license if you want to drive faster than 45 and have more than 4kw of power
[2025-02-25T22:52:29] haku: i see
[2025-02-25T22:53:13] Awyba: but i have a profile that is limited to 45 that i can quickly switch too in that case
[2025-02-25T22:53:25] haku: good idea!.
[2025-02-25T22:54:24] haku: alot of electric dirt bikes in germany? big culture there?
[2025-02-25T22:55:33] Awyba: no not at all in the us its way bigger i think i might be the only one in my region riding a talaria or surron
[2025-02-25T22:56:47] Awyba: many people ask me about it when they see it because they never saw something like that
[2025-02-25T22:57:26] haku: big community in US
[2025-02-25T22:58:00] haku: its a good bike but im afraid laws will come for these
[2025-02-25T22:58:30] haku: just some states
[2025-02-25T22:59:35] Awyba: yes i heard about it they are not quite legal in most states right? Only if they had pedals or something like that i think
[2025-02-25T23:00:19] Awyba: too much power to be an electric bicycle also i think
[2025-02-25T23:01:42] haku: yes. coast cities
[2025-02-25T23:01:50] haku: true
[2025-02-25T23:02:15] haku: also teens and kids abuse em. riding in the street on highways popping wheelies
[2025-02-25T23:05:54] haku: im not hating or anything. if i had one ill prolly do the same
[2025-02-25T23:09:24] Smart Repair: Rampingtime, Phasen current
[2025-02-25T23:41:40] Dualtron Achilleus: Tks i will look, cuz my torque seems lower under 15km/h that strange
[2025-02-25T23:43:43] Smart Repair: There are definitely people here who know more about the topic. The ramping time is just a basic thing that can influence it. However, there are many more settings that affect the torque.
[2025-02-26T00:19:12] haku: now thats a car

[2025-02-26T10:52:37] GABE: Ebike motor is cold after I bombed it to uni
[2025-02-26T10:52:38] GABE: Lmfao
[2025-02-26T10:52:42] GABE: Incredible
[2025-02-26T10:52:47] GABE: I'm in love with this ebike already sitting is so comfortable too
[2025-02-26T10:56:43] 'lekrsu': At high speeds? Sensorless isn't the cause then, reduce your motor current and shorten your wires.
[2025-02-26T10:59:32] francois schempers: get a graph reading of when it happen and give us the XML file so you can check what's up
[2025-02-26T11:07:11] GABE: it's when I'm doing a slow manuever
[2025-02-26T11:07:21] GABE: Nah sub 20
[2025-02-26T11:07:31] GABE: It's just sensorless.
[2025-02-26T11:07:41] GABE: all my wires are twisted, I mean ALL of them
[2025-02-26T11:07:56] 'lekrsu': Buy some solder then.
[2025-02-26T11:08:03] GABE: and taped up with fragile tape
[2025-02-26T11:08:17] GABE: I need leaded for the mp2 and Dan doesnt have any more.
[2025-02-26T11:08:20] GABE: dunno where to get it from
[2025-02-26T11:08:29] GABE: might aswell just get leaded for everything
[2025-02-26T11:08:30] 'lekrsu': You don't need leaded for wires.
[2025-02-26T11:09:01] GABE: There will be solder nuts everywhere
[2025-02-26T11:09:08] GABE: Should be fine tho
[2025-02-26T11:09:14] GABE: Long as it's all saturated in solder
[2025-02-26T11:09:33] GABE: I need more wire. damn, I don't wanna make a third solder nut on each line. I don't have new cables. Shits gonna be mad ugly
[2025-02-26T11:11:22] Jason: maybe if I shorted the phase on my motor I might go more than 130a
[2025-02-26T11:11:23] Jason: maybe 150 xd
[2025-02-26T11:11:46] 'lekrsu': Are your wires long?
[2025-02-26T11:12:04] Jason: I didn't cut what lonnyo sent me
[2025-02-26T11:12:11] Jason: lol
[2025-02-26T11:12:16] 'lekrsu': The hell, why not
[2025-02-26T11:12:20] Jason: full length coiled inside g30
[2025-02-26T11:12:22] Jason: never know
[2025-02-26T11:12:27] GABE: Bad
[2025-02-26T11:12:29] Jason: yeah
[2025-02-26T11:12:30] Jason: it's bad
[2025-02-26T11:12:34] GABE: Missing out on some energy
[2025-02-26T11:12:37] Jason: extra resistance and shit
[2025-02-26T11:12:45] 'lekrsu': I cut off a meter or more
[2025-02-26T11:13:09] Jason: I planned to cut the wire when I do 120cell batt
[2025-02-26T11:13:10] GABE: measure how much you need
[2025-02-26T11:13:15] Jason: but well it ain't gonna happen quick

[2025-02-26T18:16:54] Justiinx B: Hello
[2025-02-26T18:17:05] Noname: Send link
[2025-02-26T18:17:26] Justiinx B: I want to drive 70-80kmh with my G2 it's full Stock and I don't know what is the best to buy and which motor for 10 inches tires
[2025-02-26T18:21:36] francois schempers: stock batterie too ? for 70km/h depending on your weight you may have to change that too, are you new yo modding or no ?
[2025-02-26T18:22:32] Justiinx B: No I want other battery maybe 72v but don't find one that fits or smthg
[2025-02-26T18:22:46] Justiinx B: Yes I never did something like that
[2025-02-26T18:22:51] Justiinx B: Just installed shfw
[2025-02-26T18:23:21] Justiinx B: I weight 73 kg
[2025-02-26T18:24:03] francois schempers: okey, what's your budget first of all, because, going Vesc means you're changing à lot of hardware
[2025-02-26T18:24:32] Justiinx B: I say 500-800€
[2025-02-26T18:27:05] Yamal: time for seven, make the wires dance
[2025-02-26T18:29:14] Justiinx B: 😂😂
[2025-02-26T18:31:52] Yamal: ￼🐦‍🔥
[2025-02-26T18:34:37] Yamal: Now there is no sticker, and it is less fun, let's see if Scarlet arrives and fixes the matter,,
[2025-02-26T18:36:33] 'lekrsu': What's this emoji supposed to look like xD ￼
[2025-02-26T18:36:55] haku: you plan single or dual motor?
[2025-02-26T18:37:00] Yamal: Dragon on fire ? Don’t know xD
[2025-02-26T18:37:45] Justiinx B: Idk dual is better but single is alright
[2025-02-26T18:37:55] Justiinx B: Beter single first
[2025-02-26T18:38:25] Justiinx B: I hear about an 65h 17×4 motor
[2025-02-26T18:38:34] haku: you can prolly get a dual setup with 1k. but sourcing used parts. buy a good battery though. dont skimp out on that
[2025-02-26T18:38:47] Justiinx B: And an 72v 30ah 20s6p battery
[2025-02-26T18:38:47] Yamal: 40pl
[2025-02-26T18:38:49] 'lekrsu': Suspension widening, vesc, 65h 22x3, compartment separator plate grinding, 20s5p 21700.. that's it, for those speeds realistically 😁👍
[2025-02-26T18:39:08] Justiinx B: Yes and where can I find an battery
[2025-02-26T18:39:19] haku: my brother. lets help this man. his budget might not allow for that
[2025-02-26T18:39:20] 'lekrsu': Ends up at a total of more than 1000€
[2025-02-26T18:39:35] haku: are you in eu or us?
[2025-02-26T18:39:38] Justiinx B: And will the battery and motor fit or do I need the battery to be extern
[2025-02-26T18:39:41] Justiinx B: Eu
[2025-02-26T18:39:54] haku: there are sellers here. very good battery makers
[2025-02-26T18:39:54] Justiinx B: I just want to go 80kmh
[2025-02-26T18:40:00] Justiinx B: Where
[2025-02-26T18:40:04] haku: very possible
[2025-02-26T18:40:19] Justiinx B: Yes and fast acceleration to 50kmh
[2025-02-26T18:40:26] 'lekrsu': You need other bolts for the rear suspension to move it outwards, James can build the battery for you, 🥰
[2025-02-26T18:40:46] Justiinx B: What do you mean
[2025-02-26T18:40:49] Justiinx B: Which battery?
[2025-02-26T18:40:53] Justiinx B: And price
[2025-02-26T18:41:20] haku: battery always needs to pair well with vesc and motor
[2025-02-26T18:41:35] haku: cant be underpowered or overpowered
[2025-02-26T18:41:41] Justiinx B: Yes then which setup would you recommend
[2025-02-26T18:41:48] Justiinx B: For having 7k watt
[2025-02-26T18:41:53] Justiinx B: Or going 80
[2025-02-26T18:42:10] Yamal: All depends the money you can spend
[2025-02-26T18:42:29] Justiinx B: Yeah what's good budget?
[2025-02-26T18:42:33] haku: for an affordable single motor maybe alu ubox 85/150 and single 17x4 ive seen people do 80 on those
[2025-02-26T18:42:49] Justiinx B: Where can I get one of them
[2025-02-26T18:42:57] haku: james sell em in eu
[2025-02-26T18:43:09] Yamal: All from james ^^’
[2025-02-26T18:43:14] Justiinx B: I see
[2025-02-26T18:43:20] Justiinx B: And battery
[2025-02-26T18:43:21] Yamal: also cap
[2025-02-26T18:43:24] haku: james main supplier in eu i think
[2025-02-26T18:43:29] Justiinx B: Nice

[2025-02-26T18:54:12] haku: and dual motors you might need a monorim too
[2025-02-26T18:54:13] Justiinx B: That means 150€ vesc 250€ motor and 500+ for battery

[2025-02-26T19:00:52] Jason: the steer tube is bent, thread on aliminium c thingy is stripped, bearings shot and the alignment of it is crooked
[2025-02-26T19:00:52] Justiinx B: Or not
[2025-02-26T19:01:11] Jason: only thing great on there is plate
[2025-02-26T19:01:12] Justiinx B: Fat tires
[2025-02-26T19:01:21] Jason: 10x3
[2025-02-26T19:01:29] Justiinx B: Like vsett
[2025-02-26T19:01:48] Justiinx B: Does it fit on G2 back?
[2025-02-26T19:01:51] Yamal: but are you talking about your scooter or the fork plates?
[2025-02-26T19:01:56] Jason: @lekrsu
[2025-02-26T19:02:05] Jason: the monorim parts
[2025-02-26T19:02:18] Yamal: Thanks ..
[2025-02-26T19:02:20] Jason: fork plate is the only intact thing on that suspension (and air shock)

[2025-02-26T19:06:44] 'lekrsu': uh
[2025-02-26T19:06:51] Jan: I wonder if anyone got a G3 already
[2025-02-26T19:07:03] Jason: I'm curious
[2025-02-26T19:07:40] 'lekrsu': After swapping the bolts to have 150mm dropout sure
[2025-02-26T19:08:01] 'lekrsu': Original dropout is 115mm
[2025-02-26T19:08:34] Yamal: Pretty scooter for Daly
[2025-02-26T19:10:17] haku: my powerstage stuck on customs. hopefully soon too
[2025-02-26T19:12:01] haku: if g3 has an X stlye headlight ive prolly seen one in town. need to take a closer look
[2025-02-26T19:12:55] Jan: I dont know what it has tbh
[2025-02-26T19:14:22] haku: like the headlights on the zt3
[2025-02-26T19:22:17] Jason: try fitting 90h
[2025-02-26T19:22:21] Jason: or 100h
[2025-02-26T19:23:55] haku: i didnt know you can widen dropout on these g2. very cool
[2025-02-26T19:24:02] Rogerio Figueiredo: That is the easier part
[2025-02-26T19:26:50] 'lekrsu': otherwise you can't even fit a G30 motor heh
[2025-02-26T19:27:10] 'lekrsu': G2 is 25h originally
[2025-02-26T19:27:17] 'lekrsu': "Xiaomi motor size"
[2025-02-26T19:27:31] francois schempers: you can, I went the extra mile and made the other side supported, you know, for extra oumf
[2025-02-26T19:27:33] haku: is it easy to do? or need lots of welding and cnc
[2025-02-26T19:27:54] haku: nice. good to know

[2025-02-26T19:28:01] 'lekrsu': Just swap 2 or 4 bolts and add bushings
[2025-02-26T19:28:01] puneDir: Theres no info
[2025-02-26T19:28:17] 'lekrsu': don't remember how many, brain dead

[2025-02-26T19:29:00] haku: g2 will be in my scooter list then. thats amazing
[2025-02-26T19:29:29] francois schempers: thats h60, but I think I can fit h80
[2025-02-26T19:30:54] 'lekrsu': from this
[2025-02-26T19:30:59] 'lekrsu': to this
[2025-02-26T19:31:32] GABE: I'm a retard
[2025-02-26T19:31:33] francois schempers: you can ask @Happy_Giraffe for the perfect spacer size, he machined mine
[2025-02-26T19:31:44] haku: very cool
[2025-02-26T19:31:46] GABE: I'm bedridden for over a month surely
[2025-02-26T19:31:53] GABE: Fuck
[2025-02-26T19:31:58] GABE: I can't even go get a glass of water
[2025-02-26T19:32:04] GABE: can't even crawl
[2025-02-26T19:32:05] 'lekrsu': But front suspension needs to be swapped out as it'll break within no time.
[2025-02-26T19:32:09] haku: your good. stay strong
[2025-02-26T19:32:25] francois schempers: go get some medical attention maybe a good idea ?
[2025-02-26T19:32:41] 'lekrsu': Hopefully G3 front can be retrofit, would be awesome.
[2025-02-26T19:32:44] GABE: Yeah I'm gonna request a scan to see if it's dislocated
[2025-02-26T19:32:58] GABE: I'm so happy i didn't snap the shit
[2025-02-26T19:33:01] GABE: I got letoff easy any way you see it
[2025-02-26T19:33:04] francois schempers: that's for sure
[2025-02-26T19:33:04] GABE: Or head on
[2025-02-26T19:33:22] haku: fracture is bad dude. even hairline fractures need time healing
[2025-02-26T19:33:33] GABE: Yeah
[2025-02-26T19:33:39] GABE: Id assume so
[2025-02-26T19:33:42] GABE: never felt pain like this before
[2025-02-26T19:33:54] haku: you bruised up tomorrow

[2025-02-26T19:34:06] GABE: no smoking either
[2025-02-26T19:34:09] GABE: can't get to the door
[2025-02-26T19:34:10] 'lekrsu': Go to the hospital

[2025-02-26T19:46:28] Mirono escooters: Where can I see Rt hall data info again?
[2025-02-26T19:46:42] 'lekrsu': There's a hall tab for calibration
[2025-02-26T19:46:50] Jason: mmm
[2025-02-26T19:46:53] Jason: didn't knew that

[2025-02-26T19:47:34] Jason: mmh shitsky
[2025-02-26T19:48:07] 'lekrsu': probably motor tab, can't check rn
[2025-02-26T19:48:19] 'lekrsu': phone app doesn't show the tab while disconnected
[2025-02-26T19:48:32] Jason: same
[2025-02-26T19:48:39] Mirono escooters: Detect foc hall sensors?
[2025-02-26T19:48:47] Mirono escooters: None detected seem. Sus. All 3 ded? Eh.

[2025-02-26T19:49:09] haku: flipsky really that bad even at low currents? like 72v 20bat 50phase
[2025-02-26T19:49:40] haku: ive always wondered this
[2025-02-26T19:50:24] Mirono escooters: Meh
[2025-02-26T19:50:26] Mirono escooters: It works fine
[2025-02-26T19:50:36] Jason: <photos/photo_21695@26-02-2025_19-50-36.jpg>
[2025-02-26T19:50:37] 'lekrsu': Bad qc, high failure rate on some. Too random.
[2025-02-26T19:50:38] Jason: hmm
[2025-02-26T19:50:39] Mirono escooters: My scoot has flipsky for months, push pretty hard, alive
[2025-02-26T19:50:49] Mirono escooters: We talk about flipsky not Spintend
[2025-02-26T19:50:54] Jason: had flipsky on gokart
[2025-02-26T19:51:00] Mirono escooters: Yeh 0 halls detected ig 5v died
[2025-02-26T19:51:00] haku: ill try for myself and see the truth
[2025-02-26T19:51:03] Matte: a lot of them have errors from factory, if they dont die first month they are okayish
[2025-02-26T19:51:07] Jason: shit
[2025-02-26T19:51:14] Jason: it died after one accel
[2025-02-26T19:51:31] Jason: fets shorted and ninebot bms saved the further gore
[2025-02-26T19:51:38] haku: push those flipskys at 250 battery amps
[2025-02-26T19:51:53] 'lekrsu': Most flipsky buyers also suffer from skill issues, doesn't help the failure rate.
[2025-02-26T19:52:39] haku: happened to me on spintend. no idea why
[2025-02-26T19:52:47] haku: 2 stages died

[2025-02-26T23:31:28] Face de Pin Sucé: There are no margins to make on Spintend because you can buy on their direct website, same as G300, or other controllers 😊 G300 also is shit for racing, Spintend doesn't like 22S, Tronic is fuckin hell expensive, Seven is already private for EU, there is not much left x)

[2025-02-27T15:26:56] Yamal: Something to keep in mind about spintend 85/250 is that it has a lot of battery current, comparable to first class or high-end ones.
[2025-02-27T15:28:15] Yamal: porsche Taycan uses 85/250

[2025-02-28T00:39:54] GABE: no pun intended
[2025-02-28T00:39:58] GABE: with that ah
[2025-02-28T00:40:19] Yamal: How is the formul@
[2025-02-28T00:40:32] 'lekrsu': Wh = Ah * V
[2025-02-28T00:40:41] Yamal: Nominal?
[2025-02-28T00:40:46] Yamal: O total
[2025-02-28T00:41:29] Yamal: 40x84=3360 wh?
[2025-02-28T00:42:21] Yamal: Yes ..
[2025-02-28T00:42:26] 'lekrsu': On batteries you'd keep the voltage to nominal (counts of 3.6) and Ah as per amps it takes to discharge or charge, within the span of one hour.
[2025-02-28T00:44:34] Smart Repair: The best option would be an Arduino that sends different profiles via UART. I'm currently looking for the same thing. I would also pay for a corresponding script.

[2025-02-28T14:46:01] Justiinx B: Hello is James am legit seller I'm just asking
[2025-02-28T14:46:57] francois schempers: Below is an in‐depth review of your script with several points to note. Overall, the structure is roughly correct for toggling between two profiles and sending commands via a VESC UART interface. However, there are some issues and potential pitfalls: 1. Inconsistent Profile Logic Comment vs. Code: Your comment states: “Profile state (false = Profile 1, true = Profile 2)” But in your sendVescCommand(bool profile) function the code does: if (profile) { // Sends Profile 1 values vesc.setRPM(rpmMaster1); // … } else { // Sends Profile 2 values vesc.setRPM(rpmMaster2); // … } This means that when profile is true you are sending what you’ve labeled as Profile 1 values and when profile is false you send Profile 2. You should either update the comments or invert the if/else logic so that they agree. 2. Button Debouncing No Debounce Handling: The code reads the button state with: bool buttonState = digitalRead(buttonPin); if (buttonState == LOW && lastButtonState == HIGH) { profile = !profile; sendVescCommand(profile); } lastButtonState = buttonState; Without any debouncing (hardware or software), mechanical bouncing may cause multiple toggles on a single press. This could lead to erratic profile switching. It is advisable to implement a debounce delay (for example, a delay of 50–100 ms after a detected press) or use a software debounce routine. 3. Potential Division by Zero Using v_in Without Check: In your commands you calculate current as: vesc.setCurrent(powerMaster1 / vesc.getVescValues().v_in); If, for any reason, vesc.getVescValues().v_in returns zero (for instance, if telemetry hasn’t been received yet or there is a communication glitch), this division will result in a divide‐by‐zero error. It is best to check that v_in is nonzero before using it or to cache the value once and verify it. 4. Multiple Calls to getVescValues() Inefficient/Non‐Deterministic Telemetry Calls: In your sendVescCommand function, you call vesc.getVescValues() several times. If these calls fetch data from a volatile source (or if they have side effects), you might get slightly different readings between calls. It is better to store the returned values in a variable and use that variable throughout the function. 5. HardwareSerial and Board-Specific Pins Pin Assignment Issues: You initialize the serial port with: vescSerial.begin(115200, SERIAL_8N1, 16, 17); This assumes that pins 16 and 17 are available for UART on your board. On some boards (especially standard Arduino Uno or similar), pins 16 and 17 may not exist or might conflict with other hardware. Ensure that your target board supports these pins as RX and TX. (On an ESP32, for example, you can often reassign UART pins, but you must be sure your wiring matches your board’s capabilities.) 6. Assumptions About the VescUart Library CAN Communication Support: Your script uses: vesc.setRPM(rpmSlave1, slaveID); and similarly for setting current with a second parameter for slave ID. This implies that your version of the VescUart library supports sending commands to a VESC via CAN by providing an ID. Not all forks of VescUart have that feature, so make sure your library version does. No Error Checking on Communication: The code assumes that calls like vesc.getVescValues() will always return valid data. In practice, you might want to check for communication errors or timeouts to ensure that your commands are actually reaching the VESC. 7. Data Types and Scaling Integer Literals for Power Values: You’ve defined power values (e.g., const int powerMaster1 = 1250;). Ensure that these values are in the units you expect (Watts). Dividing by v_in (which is in Volts) to get current is mathematically correct if you want current in Amps (since I = P/V). However, check that the VESC expects a float value for current and that your division does produce a float (for example, at least one of the operands should be a float to avoid integer division).
[2025-02-28T14:46:57] francois schempers: Summary Profile Logic: Fix the inconsistency between the comment and code logic. Debounce the Button: Implement a debounce mechanism. Check v_in: Validate that v_in is not zero before using it in a division. Cache Telemetry: Consider storing the result of vesc.getVescValues() in a local variable rather than calling it multiple times. Board-Specific Setup: Ensure that the chosen UART pins are correct for your hardware. Library Verification: Make sure that your VescUart library version supports the CAN slave commands and returns valid telemetry. Conclusion: The script is a good starting point but may not work robustly as written because of the issues mentioned above. If you address the debounce, profile logic, and potential division by zero, and verify that your hardware setup (pins, library functions) matches your target, it should function more reliably.
[2025-02-28T14:49:16] francois schempers: here is a corrected version from the llm
[2025-02-28T14:49:18] francois schempers: Below is a revised version of your script with improvements and corrections based on the issues identified. This version uses a non‐blocking debounce, caches telemetry values, checks for division by zero, and clarifies the profile logic (in this version, we define “useProfile1” as true for Profile 1 and false for Profile 2). #include <HardwareSerial.h> #include "VescUart.h" // UART interface for the VESC HardwareSerial vescSerial(1); VescUart vesc; // Button pin and debounce variables const int buttonPin = 0; bool lastButtonState = HIGH; bool useProfile1 = true; // true = Profile 1, false = Profile 2 unsigned long lastDebounceTime = 0; const unsigned long debounceDelay = 50; // milliseconds // VESC IDs (Master = 0, Slave = 1) const int masterID = 0; const int slaveID = 1; // Profile 1 values (e.g., for low-speed mode) const int rpmMaster1 = 2000; // Master VESC target RPM (e.g., ~22 km/h) const int powerMaster1 = 1250; // Master target power in Watts const int rpmSlave1 = 2500; // Slave VESC target RPM const int powerSlave1 = 1500; // Slave target power in Watts // Profile 2 values (e.g., for high-speed mode) const int rpmMaster2 = 15000; // Master VESC target RPM (e.g., ~150 km/h) const int powerMaster2 = 25000; // Master target power in Watts const int rpmSlave2 = 15500; // Slave VESC target RPM const int powerSlave2 = 25500; // Slave target power in Watts void setup() { // Initialize the button pin with an internal pull-up resistor. pinMode(buttonPin, INPUT_PULLUP); // Begin UART communication on UART1 with baud rate 115200 on pins 16 (RX) and 17 (TX). // (Ensure these pins are available on your board.) vescSerial.begin(115200, SERIAL_8N1, 16, 17); vesc.setSerialPort(&vescSerial); } void loop() { // Read the current state of the button. bool currentButtonState = digitalRead(buttonPin); // If the button state has changed, reset the debounce timer. if (currentButtonState != lastButtonState) { lastDebounceTime = millis(); } // If the button state is stable beyond the debounce delay... if ((millis() - lastDebounceTime) > debounceDelay) { // If the button is pressed (active LOW) and was previously released... if (currentButtonState == LOW && lastButtonState == HIGH) { // Toggle the profile state. useProfile1 = !useProfile1; sendVescCommand(useProfile1); } } // Save the current button state for next iteration. lastButtonState = currentButtonState; } // Function to send commands to both VESCs based on the selected profile. void sendVescCommand(bool useProfile1) { // Cache the battery voltage (v_in) from the VESC telemetry. float v_in = vesc.getVescValues().v_in; // Avoid division by zero; if v_in is too low, skip sending commands. if (v_in < 1.0) { return; } if (useProfile1) { // Profile 1: Low-speed mode vesc.setRPM(rpmMaster1); // Calculate current from power (I = Power / Voltage) vesc.setCurrent((float)powerMaster1 / v_in); // Send commands to the slave VESC via CAN using its ID. vesc.setRPM(rpmSlave1, slaveID); vesc.setCurrent((float)powerSlave1 / v_in, slaveID); } else { // Profile 2: High-speed mode vesc.setRPM(rpmMaster2); vesc.setCurrent((float)powerMaster2 / v_in); vesc.setRPM(rpmSlave2, slaveID); vesc.setCurrent((float)powerSlave2 / v_in, slaveID); } } Explanation of Improvements 1. Debounce Implementation: Instead of a simple delay in the loop, the code now uses a non-blocking debounce using millis(). The debounce delay is set to 50 ms. This prevents false toggles due to button bounce. 2. Profile Logic Clarification: The boolean variable useProfile1 now clearly indicates that true selects Profile 1 and false selects Profile 2. The sendVescCommand() function uses this flag accordingly. (Adjust the values if you want the reverse mapping.) 3. Telemetry Caching and Division Check:
[2025-02-28T14:49:18] francois schempers: The function caches the battery voltage (v_in) from vesc.getVescValues() and checks that it is not near zero. This prevents division by zero when computing the current command. 4. Floating-Point Division: The division for calculating current uses a float cast to ensure proper floating-point arithmetic rather than integer division. 5. Code Comments: Additional comments have been added throughout the code to clarify each section and the purpose of variables and functions. 6. UART Initialization Note: The code now reminds you to verify that the chosen UART pins (16 and 17) are available on your target board. --- This improved script should work more reliably and is better documented. Please test it in your environment and let me know if further adjustments are needed.

[2025-02-28T16:33:59] GABE: fiido l3 motor is proper.
[2025-02-28T16:34:09] GABE: very good heat dissipation and surface area for venting is over twice that of micro motors because the tyres dont impede dissipation
[2025-02-28T16:36:32] Morten Jensen: I already have the bike…. I just need another projekt. I have just finished my g30
[2025-02-28T16:36:43] GABE: which ebike?

[2025-02-28T16:43:50] Morten Jensen: I don’t think so, its just for fun, don’t use it very often,
[2025-02-28T16:44:17] GABE: you can burn a shit motor in one ride

[2025-02-28T21:17:18] Yamal: Your solution is to travel with a couple of suitcases and do the shopping.
[2025-02-28T21:17:33] Jason: cant carry batts
[2025-02-28T21:17:36] Jason: onto planes
[2025-02-28T21:17:41] Yamal: Ah yess
[2025-02-28T21:17:42] Jason: maybe boat but also customs
[2025-02-28T21:17:45] Yamal: Engines okee
[2025-02-28T21:17:51] Jason: mmm
[2025-02-28T21:17:53] Jason: magnet
[2025-02-28T21:18:24] Yamal: There have to be cheap cells somewhere in the country.
[2025-02-28T21:18:29] Yamal: Is okeee
[2025-02-28T21:18:34] Yamal: 😂
[2025-02-28T21:18:55] Jason: only shit cells
[2025-02-28T21:19:30] Yamal: Mine came with UPS on the plane, economy class.
[2025-02-28T21:19:31] Jason: the mh1 I'm using
[2025-02-28T21:19:42] Yamal: Weped use ?
[2025-02-28T21:19:47] Jason: is gathered from like 5 lime packs
[2025-02-28T21:19:48] Yamal: Only 50E
[2025-02-28T21:20:08] Jason: and it somehow is in balance lmfao
[2025-02-28T21:20:11] Jason: idk
[2025-02-28T21:20:17] Jason: 50e weak for me
[2025-02-28T21:20:36] Yamal: Let's see, it can also be sent to you from Europe,
[2025-02-28T21:21:11] Yamal: zero customs costs, I think... if you send on a personal level as a friend
[2025-02-28T21:21:21] Jason: i hope
[2025-02-28T21:22:54] Yamal: Well, I am not the best person to offer you cells, rather the people who make batteries from this group
[2025-02-28T21:23:04] Jason: yeah
[2025-02-28T21:23:26] Jason: maybe ill also test drive my charge only 32s bms in the g30
[2025-02-28T21:23:45] Jason: imagine vesc exploding and unstoppable dc arcs ruins everything lol
[2025-02-28T21:23:56] Yamal: I can know how much the transportation price will be.
[2025-02-28T21:24:09] Jason: I should put fuse and contactors to my g30
[2025-02-28T21:24:15] Jason: expensib
[2025-02-28T21:24:47] Yamal: I work with countless transportation companies and we ship internationally to practically all over the world.
[2025-02-28T21:24:54] Jason: holy
[2025-02-28T21:35:17] Rose: Hey there Thejesh, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-02-28T22:08:45] GABE: Who has a link for leaded Ali solder? @Mirono_escooters maybe you?
[2025-02-28T22:24:46] haku: have you had vietnam civet coffee? shit coffee?
[2025-02-28T22:25:05] Mirono escooters: Nothing good on ali so far
[2025-02-28T22:25:54] Yamal: I haven't tried it
[2025-02-28T22:30:58] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): https://www.eleshop.nl/premium-soldeertin-60-40-loodhoudend.html
[2025-02-28T22:31:11] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): They ship inside of Europe
[2025-02-28T22:31:43] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): Good material i use it contains enough flux and lead ;)
[2025-02-28T22:31:52] GABE: is this shit from pre ww2?
[2025-02-28T22:32:03] GABE: tysm
[2025-02-28T22:32:14] GABE: will be great for mp2 then
[2025-02-28T22:32:38] haku: its good shit
[2025-02-28T22:33:04] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): No clue but at least if flows very well and cant handle very high temps if needed (when you heat your busbar :) )
[2025-02-28T22:40:01] Jason: outside has become
[2025-02-28T22:40:02] Jason: bright
[2025-02-28T22:40:14] Jason: 6:40am fuck
[2025-02-28T23:09:04] Jan: Breh
[2025-02-28T23:09:14] Jan: 23:09 Switzerland
[2025-02-28T23:09:41] Jan: Rip your saturday i guess
[2025-03-01T07:39:08] David: Hi Guys Anyone here with Inokim OXO (With original front swing arm)
[2025-03-01T07:39:38] David: What 4 piston brake you put over there? All brakes im seeing matching only rear arm While for front I can't find anything
[2025-03-01T07:40:22] David: The only solution coming in my mind Is replacing original front arm with rear arm(that I'll flip) So clipper will sit on the bottom and not up like usually
[2025-03-01T09:28:30] Yamal: You could also make a custom adapter for the caliper.
[2025-03-01T09:36:42] Jason: <photos/photo_21726@01-03-2025_09-36-42.jpg>
[2025-03-01T09:37:15] Jason: why is this bms have goddamn drain connected to positive and sources connected to each other
[2025-03-01T09:37:38] Jason: I have 0 fkn idea why it's like this
[2025-03-01T09:40:47] Yamal: Hi Jason, but really, what project are you involved in now?
[2025-03-01T09:42:34] Jason: 32s vesc bms
[2025-03-01T09:42:37] Jason: charge only
[2025-03-01T09:42:58] Jason: gotta earn money for my scoot projects
[2025-03-01T09:48:50] Yamal: You can spend spare hours working at weped caffe! it would be fun xD
[2025-03-01T09:59:27] Yamal: @SibClimb you compete in Valencia?
[2025-03-01T10:24:56] Face de Pin Sucé: Nope
[2025-03-01T10:25:26] Face de Pin Sucé: And regarding the weather, I think they won't drive
[2025-03-01T10:25:41] Face de Pin Sucé: There's only in France that they drive even if there is rain
[2025-03-01T10:40:39] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Valencia Ricardo torno? hey yes I have raced as a guest driver in the cev ☺️
[2025-03-01T10:42:55] Yamal: Albaida i mean xD
[2025-03-01T12:27:45] Arnau Martinez Casals: I passed to go cause rain prediction on the 2 days event, and not having finished the nami,… I was going to go under 38kg category with my g30 with 85150 but guys told me only 3 Or 4 participants in under 38 cattegory so we will have to race with big ones lol 😂 i was scared i dont wanna be disturbing on the track at 60v 50h motors 80kmh to the big machines 92v 100h 80h +100kmh fastly etc… 😅🤣
[2025-03-01T12:29:05] Dualtron Achilleus: Its that phase current right? I have set 220 but its goes only to ~135A in full trhottle
[2025-03-01T12:29:07] Yamal: You have Nami ?
[2025-03-01T12:29:10] Dualtron Achilleus: I have 95 A bat
[2025-03-01T12:29:24] Dualtron Achilleus: Any advice?
[2025-03-01T12:29:25] Arnau Martinez Casals: Its was absurd to go so i passed this one next month going full with nami
[2025-03-01T12:30:02] Yamal: Tell us your project Nami , nice frame xD
[2025-03-01T12:30:21] Arnau Martinez Casals: <animation>
[2025-03-01T12:30:25] Arnau Martinez Casals: 22s 10p g300 75h
[2025-03-01T12:30:46] Yamal: Wooouh nice
[2025-03-01T12:30:49] Arnau Martinez Casals: Only have waiting the battery
[2025-03-01T12:31:04] Arnau Martinez Casals: Its the original one inside xd
[2025-03-01T12:31:47] Face de Pin Sucé: You shouldn't be scared, in France, Light and Racing categories drive together
[2025-03-01T12:32:00] Yamal: Wait not 22s11p?
[2025-03-01T12:32:36] Arnau Martinez Casals: I have p45b
[2025-03-01T12:32:58] Arnau Martinez Casals: And the maximum kg in absolute cattegory is 65kg i think
[2025-03-01T12:33:48] Yamal: Can ..
[2025-03-01T12:34:08] Arnau Martinez Casals: Its sufficient 45ah 450A,much peak
[2025-03-01T12:35:00] Yamal: Motor and rim by Ambrosini ?
[2025-03-01T12:36:22] Face de Pin Sucé: Are you approaching this weight ?
[2025-03-01T12:37:49] Yamal: There are a lot of people riding g300s in Spain and they seem to be doing well.
[2025-03-01T12:39:38] Yamal: It scares me a little that the heat dissipation solution is not good or optimal..
[2025-03-01T12:40:44] Arnau Martinez Casals: My friend one is 62 i think with 75
[2025-03-01T12:40:59] Yamal: but many people use them / compete / and it seems that they are robust,, 18fet..
[2025-03-01T12:41:45] Arnau Martinez Casals: I have RTR aluminium disipator, pure 10mm aluminium
[2025-03-01T12:42:06] Yamal: Pretty project
[2025-03-01T12:45:32] francois schempers: could be saturation
[2025-03-01T12:45:35] Arnau Martinez Casals: Yes, its a large histori , i didnt payed, i borrowed to a local workshop who races 2 NEW rion 60h motors and broke it bolts, smashed a lot a rim and payed me with ambrosini ones cause They colaborate with him y only payed the price difference (300€)
[2025-03-01T12:46:05] francois schempers: what's the rest of your setup ? what motor ? what battery
[2025-03-01T12:46:17] Yamal: Very good
[2025-03-01T12:47:02] Dualtron Achilleus: 16s 7P 100A peak bat
[2025-03-01T12:47:06] Yamal: Rion engines are good engines, but they are not competition engines.
[2025-03-01T12:47:31] Dualtron Achilleus: 75H lonnyo 22by3 winding
[2025-03-01T12:47:46] Dualtron Achilleus: 10 awg cable phase
[2025-03-01T12:47:50] Dualtron Achilleus: 12 awg bat
[2025-03-01T12:50:08] Jason: yeah I know buuut
[2025-03-01T12:50:33] Jason: like why's it in reverse
[2025-03-01T12:50:45] Jason: <photos/photo_21728@01-03-2025_12-50-45.jpg>
[2025-03-01T12:50:46] Jason: <photos/photo_21726@01-03-2025_09-36-42.jpg>
[2025-03-01T12:50:46] Jason: <photos/photo_21730@01-03-2025_12-50-46.jpg>
[2025-03-01T12:50:47] Jason: <photos/photo_21731@01-03-2025_12-50-47.jpg>
[2025-03-01T12:51:10] Jason: drains conncted to each other vs source connected to each other on vfbms32
[2025-03-01T12:51:19] francois schempers: can you redo motor detection so we have info on it ?
[2025-03-01T12:51:25] Dualtron Achilleus: what is this
[2025-03-01T12:52:02] francois schempers: in Vesc, the motor detection wizard
[2025-03-01T12:52:43] Dualtron Achilleus: yeah ok i wil try and share it
[2025-03-01T12:52:45] 'lekrsu': You'll only reach 220A initially then linearly reduced by you reaching top speed, down to phase equalling battery current.
[2025-03-01T12:53:12] Dualtron Achilleus: no reach 135 peak then slow down like you say
[2025-03-01T12:53:28] Jason: anyway we'll see about that after mosfet or AFE bursts into flame after i order the test boards
[2025-03-01T12:54:16] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-03-01T12:56:07] 'lekrsu': Tried out mxlemming?
[2025-03-01T12:56:40] Dualtron Achilleus: no i dont know what it is
[2025-03-01T12:56:50] francois schempers: you either have big voltage sag on battery witch prevent esc to go full 220A, or your motor saturate and can only take in 135A, with motor info we will have more clue, you could also graph battery current and voltage under load to see if it comes frome battery
[2025-03-01T12:57:01] francois schempers: the observer
[2025-03-01T12:57:03] Dualtron Achilleus: when my motor reach max speed its seems there is a litlte weird sound
[2025-03-01T12:58:38] 'lekrsu': In air? The wrong settings can quickly indicate as regen spam via RT dash on max speed.
[2025-03-01T12:58:39] Dualtron Achilleus: my motor is big he cant take a lot more
[2025-03-01T12:58:46] Jason: 2 mosfets should be opposing each other right?
[2025-03-01T12:58:56] Dualtron Achilleus: in the air and on also on riding
[2025-03-01T12:58:58] Jason: and my knowledge is correct then
[2025-03-01T12:59:19] Jason: does it's direction matter
[2025-03-01T12:59:37] Jason: drains connected to each other or source connected to each other
[2025-03-01T12:59:42] Jason: mmmh thanks
[2025-03-01T12:59:51] Jason: you finally solved my answer
[2025-03-01T12:59:59] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-03-01T13:00:34] Jason: mmh
[2025-03-01T13:02:04] Jason: time to complete
[2025-03-01T13:02:31] Jason: soon
[2025-03-01T13:02:43] 'lekrsu': And the wonders of why some boards turn on discharge with charge, vice versa
[2025-03-01T13:02:55] Jason: diode vdrop
[2025-03-01T13:03:17] 'lekrsu': The diode can only oppose so much current before it pops. Safety my beloved.
[2025-03-01T13:03:22] Jason: mmm
[2025-03-01T13:03:33] 'lekrsu': ANT uses overkill mosfets or they just do not care.
[2025-03-01T13:03:38] Jason: lmao
[2025-03-01T13:03:48] Jason: doesn't it charge "less"
[2025-03-01T13:03:54] Jason: vdrop over diodes
[2025-03-01T13:03:59] Jason: (that's what I had with my jbd)
[2025-03-01T13:05:58] Jason: prob gonna order the eval board tmrw
[2025-03-01T13:05:58] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Jason has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-03-01T13:05:59] Face de Pin Sucé: Wtf, how possible? We were 58Kg last year with bigger motors, battery, ... You guys need to work on weight loss
[2025-03-01T13:06:26] francois schempers: he can be big, but with wrong settings, can be saturated just as easy
[2025-03-01T13:11:31] Jason: nmm
[2025-03-01T13:15:20] Jason: https://youtu.be/LAbWsqS51Tk
[2025-03-01T13:15:23] Jason: damn
[2025-03-01T13:17:30] francois schempers: I'm 140kg, there is some weight you just can't loose on my side 😂😂
[2025-03-01T13:18:05] Yamal: Really ?
[2025-03-01T13:20:21] Yamal: You need Dualtron X limited with dual 3Shull1400
[2025-03-01T13:21:29] Yamal: XD
[2025-03-01T13:23:01] francois schempers: Im 2m tall too ^^
[2025-03-01T13:23:49] francois schempers: @SibClimb any news from my hardware ? 😁
[2025-03-01T13:28:38] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes 😜 pm
[2025-03-01T13:29:18] Yamal: Now I have an impossible mission, to go shopping in a supermarket that is really full, to buy provisions, there is a window of good weather now I read that it will soon start to rain again, and I say impossible mission because I have to go in with the scooter inside
[2025-03-01T13:29:41] Yamal: Xiaomi can’t go and back
[2025-03-01T13:34:11] Arnau Martinez Casals: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZNdJbt8X4
[2025-03-01T13:35:08] Arnau Martinez Casals: My friend one x coming with vesc g300 and big motors hahah
[2025-03-01T13:35:49] Yamal: Wouhhh
[2025-03-01T13:35:54] Arnau Martinez Casals: My like 1,90 100kg
[2025-03-01T13:36:11] Yamal: Can’t see
[2025-03-01T13:36:20] Yamal: Don’t have tiktok
[2025-03-01T13:36:24] Yamal: Is ready ?
[2025-03-01T13:36:57] Arnau Martinez Casals: And Wis his own programed display (hes pc hacker 🤣) im losed after word Or paint lol
[2025-03-01T13:37:14] Arnau Martinez Casals: Idk private account?
[2025-03-01T13:37:29] Yamal: I mean the scooter
[2025-03-01T13:37:36] Arnau Martinez Casals: No
[2025-03-01T13:38:00] Arnau Martinez Casals: He has to down voltaje he has 96v full
[2025-03-01T13:39:25] Yamal: The g300 look like they fit perfectly in the place of the stock controllers
[2025-03-01T13:40:51] francois schempers: I'm building my scooter with rage-mechanic's part, h60 motor and c350 controller, with 20s battery, all cramed in a max g2, should be enough to carry me around 😂
[2025-03-01T13:42:16] Yamal: Very nice project ,, i know.for me your g2 is “ THE G2” you understand
[2025-03-01T13:56:31] Finn: Saw that on my fyp too😂
[2025-03-01T14:16:24] francois schempers: thanks ^^
[2025-03-01T14:16:46] francois schempers: it got a new screen too thanks to @koxx3
[2025-03-01T14:33:34] Yamal: …
[2025-03-01T14:42:46] Mirono escooters: Wich screen? O o
[2025-03-01T14:47:45] Yamal: Daly with Sossusvlei

[2025-03-01T15:11:14] GABE: @PaoloWu hooking me up with some lead, chad.
[2025-03-01T15:15:32] A.P: Vesc 😍
[2025-03-01T15:44:52] Jason: mmm is that the now closed source display thingy
[2025-03-01T15:47:10] francois schempers: yup, but I saw some more open source info pass through this chat
[2025-03-01T15:48:03] Jason: yeah someone cloned it before it got closed source
[2025-03-01T16:01:09] Yamal: hehe
[2025-03-01T16:46:49] haku: you can carry all that on a scooter?
[2025-03-01T16:58:16] Yamal: Yes, the backpack on the back and the box in the middle of the feet exerting pressure so that it does not move
[2025-03-01T17:04:23] Jason: my head hurts
[2025-03-01T17:04:35] Jason: and i didnt even fully consider any important thingy
[2025-03-01T17:04:45] Jason: its evaluation board anyway YOLO
[2025-03-01T17:06:24] Jason: just gotta see if it works and then decrease size very much and bam product
[2025-03-01T17:42:46] skrtt: Does anyone know if i a 18s9p pushing 350A from battery will be to much? Should i go to 20s?
[2025-03-01T17:43:15] skrtt: Cuz i have limited space on the deck and i wanted the most in paraller for more range
[2025-03-01T17:45:39] Dualtron Achilleus: Not about the s but about the P
[2025-03-01T17:45:47] Dualtron Achilleus: And the cells
[2025-03-01T17:46:51] skrtt: Yeah that i know
[2025-03-01T17:47:16] skrtt: Is just worried it will be too much current and “low” voltage
[2025-03-01T17:47:52] skrtt: Thats why i asked if its better to upgrade to 20s to handle high current better

[2025-03-01T17:57:11] francois schempers: what cells are we talking about
[2025-03-01T17:57:35] skrtt: P45b

[2025-03-01T18:04:30] Giorgio: Hi to all
[2025-03-01T18:05:23] francois schempers: 350A means you're pushing ≈ 40A per cell, witch is in the higher side of things but can be sustained with good heat dissipation
[2025-03-01T18:05:49] francois schempers: for short burst your fine, you'll Vdrop a bit but your fine
[2025-03-01T18:06:28] francois schempers: and going to 20s won't change anything, you'll still be pushing 40A per cells
[2025-03-01T18:06:59] Noname: Dry goods are easy. Try carrying a coffee in a foam cup with a sipping hole and vent
[2025-03-01T18:08:40] haku: on a standing scooter?
[2025-03-01T18:13:19] Jan: With 9P P45B you are worried about 350A?
[2025-03-01T18:15:56] Jan: Its below the rated spec even
[2025-03-01T18:21:15] haku: look at this midrive minibike frame. https://youtu.be/Hs1GSbozFXc?si=jmQ6OaJ1O4mVXTr3
[2025-03-01T18:21:57] skrtt: No im worried if the voltage is to low. From what i know having 36v and 700A is a little diferent that having 72v and 350A
[2025-03-01T18:39:15] francois schempers: voltage mostly define your top speed, not your top torque, your first phase amps limited at low speed, then battery amps limited at higher speed and THEN only max speed is reached and limited by voltage
[2025-03-01T18:42:08] Arnau Martinez Casals: 60v molicel 85150 50h torque motors
[2025-03-01T18:44:14] Basti: How much ah
[2025-03-01T18:44:32] Arnau Martinez Casals: 150 phase 80 bat

[2025-03-01T19:06:52] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Problem the geared rear hub motor spins backwards- controller hard to disassemble- will probably have to operate on the intermediate cable extension...
[2025-03-01T19:06:52] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Little intermediate project, electrification of a guest bike... Bafang C961 Controler Model: C-WZKD4818A-LS-T1

[2025-03-01T19:54:29] Yamal: Get vesc ?
[2025-03-01T19:54:32] haku: i cant track it locally for some reason. it says picked up by carrier
[2025-03-01T19:55:35] Jason: bms
[2025-03-01T19:56:26] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Shure some day maybe if I try the trike project one with dual channels maybe?
[2025-03-01T19:56:55] Yamal: You are creating an empire in your country, soon girls in bison coats will open the car doors for you
[2025-03-01T19:57:30] Yamal: Single / dual okee important thing is mount VESC
[2025-03-01T19:58:16] haku: bms that can work with vesc?
[2025-03-01T19:58:26] Jason: yep
[2025-03-01T19:58:33] Yamal: pure wave without cuts, greater power with lower energy current and smaller size xD
[2025-03-01T19:58:37] haku: oh boy
[2025-03-01T19:58:39] Jason: donate some dollars i need to pay for shipping aaaa
[2025-03-01T19:58:40] Jason: xd
[2025-03-01T19:59:04] haku: i wish i can fund you dude.
[2025-03-01T20:02:42] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: What is the status of regen capacity on these? Programable - i wouldn't even waste a regen controller on that guest bikes geared hub. Maybe on my main bike with a front wheel from grin tech for fat front motor generator? Are they using VESC?
[2025-03-01T20:05:12] Yamal: The truth is that I am not the best person to talk about the regenerative or electric brake, I have never used one and also in any electronics, but they can be used with the correct configuration
[2025-03-01T20:06:34] Yamal: I always say that I prefer to use brake pads, and more so on our drives, which are somewhat Viking.
[2025-03-01T20:07:22] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: I hate wasting break pads...
[2025-03-01T20:07:38] Yamal: but I have to admit that in the Xiaomi I have an electric brake
[2025-03-01T20:07:46] Yamal: Man
[2025-03-01T20:07:54] Yamal: You are Asian?
[2025-03-01T20:08:00] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: The entire mech brake should be just safety...
[2025-03-01T20:11:14] Yamal: I ask you because maybe you live nearby or have ever seen BV and you don't know it and neither do we xD
[2025-03-01T20:15:18] Yamal: <photos/photo_21749@01-03-2025_20-15-18.jpg>

[2025-03-01T21:10:05] Yamal: Look very nice
[2025-03-01T21:11:35] haku: little by little. use current parts then upgrade

[2025-03-02T14:54:34] JPPL: Take it easy 😂
[2025-03-02T14:56:40] francois schempers: How to Reduce the Delay: 1. Reduce Throttle Ramp Time: - Lower the throttle ramp time (or increase the ramp step) so that the duty cycle increases faster. - Example: If your current ramp time is set to 0.3–0.5 seconds per step, try reducing it to around 0.1–0.2 seconds. - *Note:* This change should be done gradually to avoid sudden current spikes. 2. Increase the Startup Boost: - Adjust cc_startup_boost_duty upward so that the ESC gives an immediate higher current at zero throttle. - For instance, if the default is 0.01 (1%), try increasing it to 0.04–0.06. - *Caution:* Too high a boost can cause abrupt, jerky launches or overstress the components.

[2025-03-02T16:42:53] Dualtron Achilleus: 120km/h in the air and only 60 riding?
[2025-03-02T16:43:08] Dualtron Achilleus: and on much phase amp
[2025-03-02T16:43:28] SchweigePflicht: What do you mean
[2025-03-02T16:43:46] Dualtron Achilleus: battery amp 55 and phase amps?
[2025-03-02T16:43:53] SchweigePflicht: 80A
[2025-03-02T16:44:05] SchweigePflicht: FW 25A
[2025-03-02T16:44:06] Dualtron Achilleus: that really low
[2025-03-02T16:44:38] SchweigePflicht: how high should I
[2025-03-02T16:44:53] SchweigePflicht: I Head it on 130 But still 60
[2025-03-02T16:45:29] Dualtron Achilleus: how much you had before vesc
[2025-03-02T16:46:06] SchweigePflicht: Scooter is completely custom built directly with VESC
[2025-03-02T16:46:18] SchweigePflicht: Spintend 85V 150A
[2025-03-02T16:46:58] SchweigePflicht: I Really think its the battery
[2025-03-02T16:47:53] Dualtron Achilleus: 20s with 21.5kv you should be more
[2025-03-02T16:48:12] Dualtron Achilleus: i have 16s and and 23.5 kv i go same speed wihtout fw
[2025-03-02T16:49:52] SchweigePflicht: But i a 13s and a 7s in serial
[2025-03-02T16:49:54] SchweigePflicht: Yk
[2025-03-02T16:50:20] SchweigePflicht: How many A
[2025-03-02T16:50:48] Dualtron Achilleus: so 20 s
[2025-03-02T16:51:04] Dualtron Achilleus: what is voltage vesc is saying
[2025-03-02T16:51:14] Dualtron Achilleus: 95a and 200phase
[2025-03-02T16:51:32] Dualtron Achilleus: but even with 50 A i was same near same top speed

[2025-03-02T17:15:30] Arnau Martinez Casals: Cells and bms max? Which motor you running? Single Or dual?
[2025-03-02T17:16:47] Arnau Martinez Casals: If both batterys are same cells you will have to put 6p in the 7s more than on the 13s
[2025-03-02T17:17:41] Arnau Martinez Casals: Cause your scooter dies but the 48v battery still having working voltaje
[2025-03-02T17:19:19] SchweigePflicht: Single
[2025-03-02T17:19:26] SchweigePflicht: Mini Blade Motor
[2025-03-02T17:20:23] Arnau Martinez Casals: Its a 500w/800w motor i think
[2025-03-02T17:20:47] Arnau Martinez Casals: I dont think you will had more speed
[2025-03-02T17:21:38] Arnau Martinez Casals: For 55a battery put 100/120 phase
[2025-03-02T17:22:47] Arnau Martinez Casals: And absolute like 170/180

[2025-03-02T17:46:50] haku: so thats how much you apply thermal paste. ive been doing it wrong then lol
[2025-03-02T17:47:47] JPPL: This is too much
[2025-03-02T17:48:07] haku: 18fet on a small package
[2025-03-02T17:48:20] JPPL: G300 design
[2025-03-02T17:48:39] haku: is it alu pcb you know?
[2025-03-02T17:49:04] Noname: Gotta back butter those ceramic tiles else they don't bond lol
[2025-03-02T17:52:49] JPPL: Wich One?
[2025-03-02T17:53:53] haku: are you going to clean it up and apply your own or just leave it?
[2025-03-02T17:55:59] JPPL: For now just leave it, all board os completou submerged on this paste 😂

[2025-03-02T17:57:43] JPPL: Did
[2025-03-02T17:57:54] Jason: prob pcb
[2025-03-02T17:58:13] haku: whats your input on this design?
[2025-03-02T17:58:29] Jason: tf
[2025-03-02T17:58:37] Jason: looks
[2025-03-02T17:58:37] Jason: fine
[2025-03-02T17:58:44] haku: did they steal your open source creation?
[2025-03-02T17:58:48] Jason: nah
[2025-03-02T17:58:59] Jason: they prob wont
[2025-03-02T17:59:09] haku: you never know
[2025-03-02T17:59:22] haku: china sneaky but i like it
[2025-03-02T18:00:04] haku: ballsy but they should inovate
[2025-03-02T18:00:26] JPPL: This is really similar with g300 layout
[2025-03-02T18:01:07] Jason: is it
[2025-03-02T18:01:11] Jason: like uhh phase shunt
[2025-03-02T18:01:24] Jason: really seems like phase shunt imo
[2025-03-02T18:05:31] haku: spintend 18fet where are you
[2025-03-02T18:06:07] JPPL: They need to sell 250a and 240a batch 😂
[2025-03-02T18:06:29] haku: true
[2025-03-02T18:07:23] haku: they shouldve developed the 18fet and kept the old 250a
[2025-03-02T18:11:39] Jason: i should
[2025-03-02T18:11:45] Jason: develop 150v 18fet
[2025-03-02T18:11:47] Jason: real quick
[2025-03-02T18:13:10] haku: would that be possible?
[2025-03-02T18:13:18] Jason: ajust gotta

[2025-03-02T18:13:30] Jason: n good shit
[2025-03-02T18:13:37] haku: that be cool dude
[2025-03-02T18:14:01] haku: what would the cost of that be?
[2025-03-02T18:14:31] haku: prolly as expensive as seven you think?
[2025-03-02T18:25:41] Jason: i dunno man

[2025-03-02T20:35:34] haku: im pretty amazed they havent cloned seven design yet. maybe too expensive parts
[2025-03-02T20:37:30] haku: does tolt fets come from china?
[2025-03-02T20:38:54] haku: they have a 30fet lol
[2025-03-02T20:39:56] haku: how about torp? is that design stolen? or just non open source vesc?
[2025-03-02T20:43:07] haku: dont get me wrong folks. there are innovative chinamen companies. flipsky isnt one of em
[2025-03-02T20:49:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But why do spintend stop at 85-250 why not go nuc power so we can answer those with 500a phase at least (nuc f12)

[2025-03-04T13:28:36] Yamal: @St0fzuiger Spintend has commented on your video, you are the boss!!!
[2025-03-04T14:12:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Spintend has no TikTok so on mine they can't comment
[2025-03-04T14:24:57] Matte: Is fun and chill on emtb
[2025-03-04T14:26:49] Matte: Any insulation between parallel groups?
[2025-03-04T14:50:22] GABE: Nevermind the solder isn't the issue Balance was off 🤣🤣
[2025-03-04T14:50:30] GABE: That's some sexy balance for solder NGL
[2025-03-04T16:28:40] Jerome (St0fzuiger 🛴 ): I am in close contact with them :)
[2025-03-04T17:46:09] GABE: E brake not allowed if you even wanna stand a chance
[2025-03-04T17:46:42] GABE: I don't think you have to mod anything. Maybe beefier caps would be good tho
[2025-03-04T17:48:02] GABE: MOSFETs will be edged
[2025-03-04T17:51:14] Arnau Martinez Casals: <video_file>
[2025-03-04T17:51:40] Arnau Martinez Casals: Selling my g30, with spintend 85150, 16s 5p molicel p42a, 50h torque motors, WITHOUT DISPLAY. 1500€
[2025-03-04T17:52:05] Arnau Martinez Casals: Barcelona, Spain
[2025-03-04T17:54:07] GABE: I think you can replace them but the logic board won't do more than 22s anyways iirc
[2025-03-04T17:54:19] Jason: tbh
[2025-03-04T17:54:25] Jason: better off making entire new vesc
[2025-03-04T17:54:31] GABE: it would make it more stable I think? technically
[2025-03-04T17:54:33] GABE: Yeah
[2025-03-04T17:54:56] GABE: If you're gonna change parts then just get an mp2 lmfao cause you already know what you're doing
[2025-03-04T17:56:07] Jason: and don't destroy the board while soldering lol
[2025-03-04T17:56:57] Jason: <animation>
[2025-03-04T18:18:10] haku: is this the 2p?
[2025-03-04T18:26:01] Arnau Martinez Casals: Only mosfets have to be replaced is it only thing that limits me?
[2025-03-04T18:26:56] Arnau Martinez Casals: I want 22s with 150battery almost
[2025-03-04T18:27:13] Arnau Martinez Casals: Which esc recommend
[2025-03-04T18:27:41] Arnau Martinez Casals: Think 85150 cant handle it i will meed 85250 modified probably?
[2025-03-04T18:32:52] GABE: You can't use ebrake and would prob still be hyper unstable even if you switch fets cos board
[2025-03-04T18:33:00] GABE: Id recommend switching caps
[2025-03-04T18:33:10] GABE: they usually have lesser real headroom than the MOSFETs do
[2025-03-04T18:33:17] GABE: 150v cap is fine.
[2025-03-04T18:40:53] francois schempers: https://rage-mechanics.com/controleurs-generiques/1231-c350.html
[2025-03-04T18:40:53] francois schempers: can go 30s
[2025-03-04T18:51:06] GABE: Yess brother
[2025-03-04T18:51:20] GABE: Amazing range when not commuting. almost doubled even.
[2025-03-04T18:51:26] GABE: Commute = Bomb it
[2025-03-04T18:52:47] haku: when you pull lots of amps sometimes on these 2p 3p config. some p groups seem to pull more than others
[2025-03-04T18:52:57] haku: i notice on mine too
[2025-03-04T18:53:24] haku: but that voltage difference isnt bad at all. on yours
[2025-03-04T19:01:54] GABE: I only used small motors on mine
[2025-03-04T19:09:51] Arnau Martinez Casals: Not rich

[2025-03-04T23:31:21] Arnau Martinez Casals: How about capacitors, needed with bigger mosfets no?
[2025-03-04T23:32:19] haku: im not sure tbh. i thought your just swapping the broken ones. i have no experience with it
[2025-03-04T23:32:39] Arnau Martinez Casals: Prefer change all to big ones
[2025-03-04T23:33:02] Arnau Martinez Casals: Cause i were limited on power beacuse fets

[2025-03-05T15:02:24] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. JPPL has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-03-05T15:05:37] Noname: Weirdo
[2025-03-05T15:07:48] Noname: Guess the thing I printed. I Love the Majic oven for this stuff.
[2025-03-05T15:24:35] Matte: :/ noise when regen braking and noise when trying to spin. FOC, been trying to play with observers and gain but perhaps I need to downgrade 6.05 firmware to 6.00? One member here said they had most luck with 6.00 on go-foc d100s
[2025-03-05T15:24:59] Matte: Any ideas? I'm at work now and will try your suggestions when I'm home later
[2025-03-05T15:33:48] Roby MacGyver: Wow fantastic🤩
[2025-03-05T15:37:47] Roby MacGyver: Can anyone tell me why when I start with my 3000 watt 58 amp scooter putting everything 100% it starts slowly not on one wheel, I have a motor with 50 magnets 11 rims,The scooter weighs only 24kg and is single motor
[2025-03-05T15:38:05] JPPL: 6.05 Will work same, makerx already published it. You can use it. Meanwhile i would clear all settinga and reprogram everything
[2025-03-05T15:59:52] haku: what is that
[2025-03-05T16:08:01] JPPL: <photos/photo_21810@05-03-2025_16-08-01.jpg>
[2025-03-05T16:13:38] Noname: I said guess.
[2025-03-05T16:14:00] Noname: It's a siphoning valve. Aka one way valve
[2025-03-05T16:27:14] francois schempers: you can adjust ramp up time if you want more torque faster, it will make the esc run hotter
[2025-03-05T16:27:48] francois schempers: tesla valve ?
[2025-03-05T16:29:00] Yamal: XD
[2025-03-05T16:29:38] Yamal: 🤙
[2025-03-05T16:33:36] Matte: It is 6.05 on the video. 5.03 was quieter but slight issue with making it start spinning. It's been reprogrammed a dozen times already.
[2025-03-05T16:33:55] haku: but plug?
[2025-03-05T16:34:48] Matte: Tried observer gain all the way from 4.5 default down to 0.9. More or less all the same
[2025-03-05T16:36:18] Hugo: <video_file>
[2025-03-05T16:36:37] Hugo: someone can help me? i have It on 60a discharge and I have to be at 20kmh aprox to notice that power

[2025-03-05T16:53:12] Smart Repair: 22s should not be a problem without ebrake. Mosfets and caps are up to 100V
[2025-03-05T16:58:54] Smart Repair: some more information please. Which battery? which controller, which settings? post motor xml
[2025-03-05T17:15:04] haku: if thats all wood your transporting im very impressed with the weight these xiaomis can hold
[2025-03-05T17:36:02] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Pro I think
[2025-03-05T17:37:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Stick vesc to frame what glue?

[2025-03-05T17:58:29] Noname: That's a series of hart shaped tubes
[2025-03-05T17:58:49] Noname: If your brave enough, yes

[2025-03-05T18:18:29] Matte: Yep
[2025-03-05T18:45:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Can I use dead 75200 bottom plates for cooling?
[2025-03-05T18:45:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like how good will it be
[2025-03-05T18:45:53] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: (to cool 85150 and 85240)
[2025-03-05T18:47:09] Oreo huzky: Bro I just got a whole fucking bowl of ice cream from the ice cream man
[2025-03-05T18:47:58] Mattia: does anyone have the passwords for the ant bms app?
[2025-03-05T18:48:04] Mattia: Lvl 1 2 3 4 5
[2025-03-05T19:06:58] Matte: Will as soon as I get home from work. Thanks!
[2025-03-05T19:08:04] Matte: Might I downgrade to 6.00 first? A scooter user with same controller stated they had problems with other fws but 6.00 works.
[2025-03-05T19:30:55] JPPL: Pro
[2025-03-05T19:32:05] Arnau Martinez Casals: Isn’t too little?
[2025-03-05T19:32:16] JPPL: Agree that involvea more cooling, that 1cm +- block case aluminium right on top of both sides of fets who know if it works, probabily better to stick some heatsink on top, wven better with fan
[2025-03-05T19:32:20] Arnau Martinez Casals: Lets see your resuslts
[2025-03-05T19:32:26] JPPL: Crazy little, compact
[2025-03-05T19:33:00] JPPL: Simple compact design, little goles on SIDE to stick out cables, and top pcb board for i dont know what 😊
[2025-03-05T19:35:33] JPPL: They are very Nice! But sizes matters, it hás a little boarder inside, ia not 100 flat

[2025-03-05T19:38:14] haku: please show how you mount tolt fets to the heatsink
[2025-03-05T19:39:06] haku: what did you use to mount it? im thinking of this setup too
[2025-03-05T19:53:38] haku: gotcha. how about the main busses. isnt it too close to touch on heatsink?
[2025-03-05T19:54:16] haku: very thick thermal pad i guess
[2025-03-05T19:58:05] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Need to make holes and that
[2025-03-05T19:58:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also will be Threadless can't be bother to theread
[2025-03-05T20:02:18] JPPL: 1mm max, 0.5 i think it works with preassure
[2025-03-05T20:02:33] JPPL: Maybe i go for 0,75 but isnt too much?
[2025-03-05T20:02:57] JPPL: 24w max i found
[2025-03-05T20:04:17] JPPL: This setup Will BE inside a onewheel CNC box, perfect fit, i Change inside aluminium player for a hea y One and make costum holes to make aluminium(tronic heatsink) on aluminium(case)
[2025-03-05T20:05:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'll bolt them
[2025-03-05T20:06:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ill use paper to mark holes ?
[2025-03-05T20:06:07] JPPL: <photos/photo_21822@05-03-2025_20-06-07.jpg>
[2025-03-05T20:06:51] JPPL: All aluminium parts Will BE with No thermal pad, its flat metal on metal then thermal pad on tronic
[2025-03-05T20:07:35] JPPL: Little 3D to prevent bend
[2025-03-05T20:07:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_21824@05-03-2025_20-07-46.jpg>

[2025-03-05T20:09:08] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also what do u say about using those as thermal blocks ?
[2025-03-05T20:09:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_21826@05-03-2025_20-09-15.jpg>

[2025-03-05T20:09:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Those are from dead 75200 (rip)
[2025-03-05T20:10:55] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ok good to know
[2025-03-05T20:11:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm planning on making blocks that connect to that red heatsink so cooling from outside
[2025-03-05T20:12:16] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: (And writing also )
[2025-03-05T20:12:52] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Instead of the red dualtron radiatora
[2025-03-05T20:13:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: If this was to fit
[2025-03-05T20:13:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_21827@05-03-2025_20-13-39.jpg>

[2025-03-05T20:14:40] haku: smart. what fillament?
[2025-03-05T20:15:03] haku: is it high temp stuff or no need?
[2025-03-05T20:15:31] haku: amazing work your doing there bud
[2025-03-05T20:17:06] JPPL: No need high temp, i think it Will BE cool :)
[2025-03-05T20:17:30] JPPL: Doing nicely 😘 Will sharing how it goes
[2025-03-05T20:17:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So I'll try making something like that just from those dead 75200 radiators?
[2025-03-05T20:17:48] JPPL: Today Will polish the aluminium player
[2025-03-05T20:17:51] haku: share stl files if i decide to do this haha.
[2025-03-05T20:18:13] haku: if tarrifs hit china biggly this is next option

[2025-03-05T20:20:09] haku: gotcha
[2025-03-05T20:20:13] haku: thanks man
[2025-03-05T20:26:55] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Thanks brother
[2025-03-05T20:34:58] Matte: I did absolutely nothing to it when i got home and it sounds way better now?
[2025-03-05T20:38:23] Matte: https://controlc.com/98a1989f
[2025-03-05T20:38:31] Matte: i pasted the motor configuration here right after wizard
[2025-03-05T20:39:06] Matte: Maybe you notice some crazy values for a cheap 10 inch hubs that i have no experience with.
[2025-03-05T20:46:10] Matte: Print it in PC and be worry free about temperature
[2025-03-05T20:46:10] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Matte has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-03-05T20:54:35] haku: whats pc?
[2025-03-05T20:54:43] haku: poly carbonate?
[2025-03-05T21:05:08] Matte: yea
[2025-03-05T22:14:32] Matte: Took a few short starts in my aparment and seems like no issues. Funny how it fixed itself ???
[2025-03-05T22:14:41] Matte: will test more tomorrow morning
[2025-03-05T22:22:06] Matte: rode it for two meters inside my work room inside my apartment, seems okay. I will take it outside tomorrow morning and try it properly + with changes you advise and will see. A bit tired right now after work + its late for me. Thanks for the help James, will update you here with my findings
[2025-03-05T22:22:41] Matte: it was default after the motor wizard, i did adjust those values after
[2025-03-05T22:22:56] Matte: 50 bat, 100 phase, 150 absolute
[2025-03-05T22:23:13] Matte: but wanted to send you literal exact numbers wizard gives me
[2025-03-05T22:24:37] Matte: I do check values update before i do anything. i suspect as i updated the firmware over the vesc tool app on my phone, it perhaps input some insane values. I didnt think app was so limited compared to desktop....
[2025-03-05T22:25:08] Matte: it is yea, i do make sure i set up both
[2025-03-05T22:25:15] 'lekrsu': Never had read issues on single, however constantly on dual.
[2025-03-05T22:26:30] 'lekrsu': That was a cursed experience last summer, soft locked them constantly, ;)
[2025-03-05T22:27:05] Matte: i also notice my usb connection drops if i regen
[2025-03-05T22:27:10] 'lekrsu': This can only mean one thing - Vedder runs single motor
[2025-03-05T22:56:13] JPPL: Good info shared , some details are what vesc is about
[2025-03-05T23:29:41] Rose: Hey there Sergio, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-03-06T02:23:16] JPPL: From chat gpt long talk, best way to dissipate heat from MOSFETs is capton tape with carbonaut
[2025-03-06T02:23:46] JPPL: Almost back to old Xiaomi Times besides carbonaut 😊
[2025-03-06T02:28:28] haku: i want to visit tronic headquarters in california. maybe in april. need to talk to those fellas and ask some real deal questions

[2025-03-06T03:59:10] haku: thats cool. for make up?

[2025-03-06T04:08:42] haku: designing your own stuff is next level though
[2025-03-06T04:09:04] Noname: I was but idk what happened to my cad

[2025-03-06T12:01:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: You tell there is lithium inside
[2025-03-06T12:01:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: How big scooter
[2025-03-06T12:01:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: And where do you ship this also a fact
[2025-03-06T12:01:57] Mirono escooters: No, no lithium inside
[2025-03-06T12:02:02] Mirono escooters: France
[2025-03-06T12:02:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: But would maybe say ups
[2025-03-06T12:02:12] Mirono escooters: No ups. Fuck them
[2025-03-06T12:02:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: That's close atleast
[2025-03-06T12:02:16] Mirono escooters: I don't want anything to do with them
[2025-03-06T12:02:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player 🇪🇺: Try

[2025-03-06T12:39:56] Matte: never touching mobile vesc for anything else but telemetry. Thanks for the help James. When i catch a day off ill perhaps mess with it more. I definitely need lower amps on front wheel or traction control
[2025-03-06T12:43:19] Matte: is it safe to assume these values are for both motors added up?
[2025-03-06T12:53:01] Hugo: Hey, how does the profiles in vesc do?
[2025-03-06T12:53:13] Hugo: or how do they work?
[2025-03-06T12:54:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Twist throttle-whiskey throttle
[2025-03-06T13:01:11] Yamal: Moto throttle,,, I want to try
[2025-03-06T13:04:27] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: On a scooter?
[2025-03-06T13:04:52] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Try carefully
[2025-03-06T13:05:20] Yamal: Yes it’s type sur-ron
[2025-03-06T13:21:58] Finn: You got gls in your region?

[2025-03-06T13:35:53] Jason: mm
[2025-03-06T13:36:01] Jason: multiplication is done first guys
[2025-03-06T13:36:04] Jason: lolol
[2025-03-06T13:36:26] Mirono escooters: Yes, box too big
[2025-03-06T13:40:22] Yamal: Do you want to send or have sent to you?
[2025-03-06T13:45:16] Mirono escooters: Send
[2025-03-06T13:48:15] Yamal: Weight?
[2025-03-06T13:48:22] Mirono escooters: 25kg
[2025-03-06T13:49:28] Yamal: Belgium - France ?
[2025-03-06T13:55:26] Jan: I cant use a normal calculator, ive been using RPN calcs all my life
[2025-03-06T13:55:49] Jan: This cannot happen on RPN
[2025-03-06T15:09:16] Matte: Cool thanks, I'm glad I didn't yet hit 2x200A haha
[2025-03-06T15:11:23] Matte: Mirono don't they have busses between those destinations? Over here we buy a bus ticket and just load up a package with receiving person waiting for the bus at their stop
[2025-03-06T15:12:46] GABE: absolute max current saved the cell from exploding lolz
[2025-03-06T15:12:54] GABE: vesc ftw.
[2025-03-06T15:13:03] GABE: bms protection was OFF
[2025-03-06T15:14:08] GABE: chain in the drivetrain triggered it
[2025-03-06T15:19:39] Martin Kaktits: Hello. I have dual motor scoot where front motor has no working halls. Sensoreless works mpstly fine, except from 0 start - little bit of brrrt while rear motor pushes it up to speed. Question: can i somehow disable front motor up until x rpm alltogether? Then would have no brrrt even at 0 start (rear motor would do work)
[2025-03-06T15:40:52] Jason: maybe setup vss at front?
[2025-03-06T15:41:11] Jason: I have 0 knowledge of dual 😇
[2025-03-06T15:44:41] Martin Kaktits: Vss doesnt seem to be any good
[2025-03-06T15:46:10] Jason: then maybe that
[2025-03-06T15:46:17] Martin Kaktits: Na its not 😃
[2025-03-06T15:46:23] Jason: mmm
[2025-03-06T15:46:38] Jason: btw you need to tune vss
[2025-03-06T15:47:26] Martin Kaktits: This tho. Yes. I think.
[2025-03-06T15:47:29] Martin Kaktits: Smoothrr
[2025-03-06T15:57:02] Mirono escooters: Sounds dangerous to be stolen
[2025-03-06T16:08:26] Yamal: Mirono by courier is very expensive, I don't know why... you have to look for a company that moves pallets, and you will surely find a good price...
[2025-03-06T16:10:34] Mirono escooters: :(
[2025-03-06T16:12:40] Dimos: they stole the zbms too
[2025-03-06T16:18:43] francois schempers: I use pc thermal past, very good thermal conductivity and is not electrically conductive
[2025-03-06T16:19:15] Jason: lmao
[2025-03-06T16:19:51] Jason: mine will be much better
[2025-03-06T16:42:03] francois schempers: and what about high frequency detection ? so you start for 0 as if you had halls
[2025-03-06T17:16:40] Martin Kaktits: Fok it. Ima fix halls. Redo all wires
[2025-03-06T17:50:36] francois schempers: try HFI, it does wonders
[2025-03-06T19:05:20] francois schempers: you must have big saliency for it to work well
[2025-03-06T19:36:10] francois schempers: Well, he can always try ^^ but best way would be to have halls, or disable pwm until à certain speed is reach with the other motor, but would need to code à script for it
[2025-03-06T19:53:03] haku: lets go!
[2025-03-06T19:53:52] haku: what is this? air purifier?
[2025-03-06T21:32:05] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Bolted
[2025-03-06T21:32:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Now what do u say about this just use long bolts and spacers in the middle?
[2025-03-06T21:32:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_21838@06-03-2025_21-32-43.jpg>
[2025-03-06T21:32:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Every vesc has a line on that
[2025-03-06T21:52:53] Yamal: Nice
[2025-03-06T22:08:53] Yamal: <photos/photo_21839@06-03-2025_22-08-53.jpg>
[2025-03-06T22:09:26] Yamal: It's simply wonderful
[2025-03-06T22:11:21] Rose: Hey there Manuel, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-03-06T22:11:22] Yamal: It's helping me a lot these rainy days. By the way, today I came across a Segway G2 in the rain on my way out of work. The scene was amazing.
[2025-03-06T22:11:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes I got it to work just need paste and done for cooling
[2025-03-06T22:11:49] 'lekrsu': Wonderful)
[2025-03-06T22:12:08] 'lekrsu': Best frame ;)
[2025-03-06T22:12:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <video_file>
[2025-03-06T22:12:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Shitty camera integration by telegram
[2025-03-06T22:37:51] Yamal: Why did you put a front fork, do you want to mount a double engine?
[2025-03-06T22:39:19] 'lekrsu': Stock G2 suspension will break from normal use within no time.
[2025-03-06T22:39:37] 'lekrsu': Happens to every owner.
[2025-03-06T22:43:13] Yamal: but now could you mount another 65h in that fork?
[2025-03-06T22:43:44] 'lekrsu': I guess I could
[2025-03-06T22:44:00] Yamal: It's really bigger than I thought the G2, very nice scooter 👍
[2025-03-06T22:44:39] 'lekrsu': It's like your Xiaomi times three 😁
[2025-03-06T22:44:48] Yamal: He's really muscular xD
[2025-03-06T23:39:21] haku: mount it yet?
[2025-03-06T23:44:02] Yamal: G2 never
[2025-03-06T23:44:40] Yamal: The first time I saw scooter in person was today
[2025-03-06T23:45:41] haku: like that particular model? i thought you ride with others?
[2025-03-06T23:46:45] Yamal: The rider was Asian, I'd say Chinese, and he was wearing a long orange raincoat, I was wearing a garbage bag as a raincoat with 3 holes xD
[2025-03-06T23:47:53] haku: fuckin asians man. they wear wierd shit
[2025-03-06T23:48:11] haku: mask in cars and neon hats
[2025-03-06T23:48:17] Yamal: I liked it, I would say it is prettier than the legendary G30
[2025-03-06T23:48:46] haku: but more moving parts
[2025-03-06T23:49:38] haku: i think the segway evolution is pretty good. the new models look good imo
[2025-03-06T23:50:35] haku: g30 is just tested. tried and true. looks like the choice of frame for ninebot modders
[2025-03-06T23:59:40] puneDir: Anybody has pics Of stock vsett battery?
[2025-03-07T00:10:42] Jason: exactly
[2025-03-07T01:44:25] Matte: Could minimum duty cycle be used here?
[2025-03-07T01:44:30] Matte: as a dirty fix
[2025-03-07T04:41:36] ✨🇪🇸عمر: 👀👀
[2025-03-07T05:28:43] Yamal: 🤩
[2025-03-07T05:39:55] Yamal: They are amazingly pretty! The only thing we Nami owners need is to come up with some kind of box to protect the electronics a bit from water or anything that could damage them,
[2025-03-07T05:42:25] Jason: easy, make esc waterproof
[2025-03-07T05:42:28] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-03-07T05:42:36] Yamal: Easy?
[2025-03-07T05:42:47] Yamal: Like 3D box ?
[2025-03-07T05:42:59] Jason: conformal coat or pour silicone xd
[2025-03-07T05:43:10] Jason: or proper sealed enclosure with waterproof connectors
[2025-03-07T07:09:44] Yamal: cheer up those faces boys, today is Friday

[2025-03-07T10:24:37] Arnau Martinez Casals: No, g300 declares its splash proof i don’t know the IP grade
[2025-03-07T10:28:06] JPPL: High
[2025-03-07T10:28:37] JPPL: All almost seeled but cant submerge
[2025-03-07T10:29:35] JPPL: Its CNC perfect with rubber rings arround connector, closing box and USB port
[2025-03-07T10:31:10] Yamal: Nice
[2025-03-07T10:33:45] Jason: mmmm
[2025-03-07T10:33:53] Jason: use automotive connectors
[2025-03-07T10:45:46] francois schempers: on your controller you have a power on/off pin, by shorting it to vbat generally, depending on hardware it turn on, that signal you can put it behind à key lock, you can buy key made for that on Aliexpress
[2025-03-07T10:47:23] francois schempers: if your phase current is at let's say 100A put abs current to 150, if you still have fault, come back to us
[2025-03-07T10:57:40] ✨🇪🇸عمر: I had started one!
[2025-03-07T10:59:45] ✨🇪🇸عمر: <photos/photo_21846@07-03-2025_10-59-45.jpg>
[2025-03-07T11:22:25] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Why do they put the controllers so far ahead?
[2025-03-07T11:25:14] Jason: literally
[2025-03-07T11:25:14] Jason: just put them apart and connect batt and CAN only
[2025-03-07T11:27:18] Roby MacGyver: ok perfect thank u i try
[2025-03-07T11:29:03] francois schempers: double check how the on/off pin works on your controller
[2025-03-07T11:29:05] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I think it will be because of the battery model but I have 22s11p
[2025-03-07T11:34:51] Matte: yay finally spinning tires
[2025-03-07T11:37:06] JPPL: Wich ctrl it is? Bms on/off is always a Smart way but not pratical for users
[2025-03-07T11:37:48] JPPL: Almost all vesc have on/off, but different ways used also
[2025-03-07T11:42:10] Roby MacGyver: i know🥲
[2025-03-07T11:43:08] Roby MacGyver: this is the diagram Can you please tell me which wires I have to connect to turn on with the key? or with a button?
[2025-03-07T11:46:01] JPPL: <photos/photo_21848@07-03-2025_11-46-01.jpg>
[2025-03-07T11:46:02] JPPL: So
[2025-03-07T11:46:19] JPPL: Dc-dc switch, number 9 must BE in control
[2025-03-07T11:46:49] JPPL: Then then number 5 contains a15
[2025-03-07T11:47:01] JPPL: Than PIN need voltage to Turn on
[2025-03-07T11:47:02] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. JPPL has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2025-03-07T13:15:57] Yamal: Pallet yes
[2025-03-07T13:17:02] JPPL: Ad15 needs 5v to Turn on, so Bridge it on your Key setup or button
[2025-03-07T13:17:05] JPPL: From ctrl
[2025-03-07T13:17:54] Yamal: <video_file>

[2025-03-07T17:52:42] Yamal: Cardio man
[2025-03-07T17:53:15] haku: thats what im doing atm.
[2025-03-07T17:53:21] haku: but only walk haha
[2025-03-07T17:55:49] Yamal: ATM or ATP?
[2025-03-07T17:56:00] haku: at the moment.
[2025-03-07T17:56:30] haku: blood pressure not too good. all the junk food
[2025-03-07T17:57:05] Roby MacGyver: Ah ok I have to go and set it on the vesc tool
[2025-03-07T17:57:05] haku: quadriple bypass candidate
[2025-03-07T17:57:31] Roby MacGyver: right here?
[2025-03-07T17:59:30] haku: when i visit europe before i get assasinated i will eat every chocolate from all the region.
[2025-03-07T18:01:04] Roby MacGyver: yes
[2025-03-07T18:01:56] Yamal: Very good
[2025-03-07T18:02:02] Yamal: Also walk it’s good
[2025-03-07T18:02:32] Yamal: I starting train too little by little
[2025-03-07T18:02:56] haku: good dude. a little bloodflow is important imo
[2025-03-07T18:03:53] haku: no need for swole. just basic stuff like pushups pullups and bodyweight squats can do alot
[2025-03-07T18:04:29] haku: training for scooter racers
[2025-03-07T18:05:00] Yamal: I am losing weight and I want to build muscle mass, but I focus on cardio (slow jogging, bullpis) and exercises with my own weight, with the goal of being fit and strong for the scooter.
[2025-03-07T18:05:55] Yamal: It's fun as you lose weight you are able to do more things
[2025-03-07T18:06:08] haku: thats the way. endurance. these racers do half squats by the looks of it
[2025-03-07T18:06:32] haku: theres benefits of both losing and gaining
[2025-03-07T18:07:07] Yamal: More push-ups, more jumps, more of everything, the weight is a burden even though it's cool to be "goose"
[2025-03-07T18:07:24] haku: burpees 😭
[2025-03-07T18:07:58] Yamal: Burpees good
[2025-03-07T18:08:10] haku: you loose weight real fast doing that
[2025-03-07T18:08:40] Yamal: Food is also key
[2025-03-07T18:08:49] haku: ofcourse
[2025-03-07T18:09:25] haku: nutrition and exercise is like swole amd projects. or peanut butter and jelly
[2025-03-07T18:09:43] haku: it goes hand in hand
[2025-03-07T18:10:20] haku: discipline and iron will my boy
[2025-03-07T18:11:32] Yamal: True
[2025-03-07T18:12:02] Yamal: You just now everything about "body cult"
[2025-03-07T18:13:29] haku: yes but some of these people just do it for aesthetics. dont get me wrong it looks cool. but when your competing in combat sports and need to maintain a certain weight. discipline will kick in
[2025-03-07T18:13:53] haku: idk if theres a weight requirement for scooter drivers
[2025-03-07T18:18:10] haku: competition will always give you the drive to win and not fuck up your weight
[2025-03-07T18:21:22] Yamal: I say this as a bit of a joke about scooters, man! Simply put, when you lose weight, as is my case, you gain agility in general and that's cool. I've done acrobatics and mountain sports all my life, then I went to the gym for various periods of time in different years, then you get married and everything changes, now I'm trying to be agile again, which is always fun, and no! There's no weight limit for riders, so it's logical that, with the same scooter preparations, the lighter rider is faster?
[2025-03-07T18:23:45] haku: yes. agility very important. thats what happens when you have kids man. ive gained all this weight because i choose to. i would not go on a diet infront of my boy. that be weird im eating salmon and veggies while hes eating a cheeseburger
[2025-03-07T18:24:34] haku: bringing a food prep container to fast foods lol
[2025-03-07T18:25:24] Yamal: WHAT
[2025-03-07T18:25:33] Yamal: 🦦
[2025-03-07T18:25:53] haku: just saying its unfair if i also put my son on a diet and not enjoy his food
[2025-03-07T18:26:36] Yamal: Man
[2025-03-07T18:27:10] haku: you have to prepare your endurance and balance man. if you plan on competing
[2025-03-07T18:27:27] Yamal: Protein foods are key to good health, you have to reduce the amount of carbohydrates you eat
[2025-03-07T18:27:27] haku: pistol squats and squat holds
[2025-03-07T18:27:52] haku: i eat it all. diet not a priority
[2025-03-07T18:28:22] haku: all these foods i was restricted to eat when i was competing is now on the table
[2025-03-07T18:28:35] Yamal: Salads are good, especially if they are green, they cleanse the blood and provide minerals and fiber, but meat and eggs are necessary
[2025-03-07T18:28:57] haku: agreed. ive eaten that with just balsamic vinegar for years
[2025-03-07T18:29:09] haku: not no more
[2025-03-07T18:29:28] Yamal: I'm telling you these things to myself too xD
[2025-03-07T18:29:54] haku: ive prolly gained 50lbs walking weight
[2025-03-07T18:30:11] haku: i use to walk around 170lbs
[2025-03-07T18:31:34] haku: also i stoped training bjj and wrestling. that stuff burns alot of calories when practicing
[2025-03-07T18:31:37] Yamal: 🐾
[2025-03-07T18:32:03] Yamal: True, just a lot
[2025-03-07T18:32:34] haku: you dont even noticed your drenched in sweat. after practice
[2025-03-07T18:32:42] Yamal: Since they banned stickers I need to see what emojis look like in real life
[2025-03-07T18:32:45] Yamal: Okee?
[2025-03-07T18:33:01] haku: good ol days. staph infected mats and ringworms.
[2025-03-07T18:33:24] Yamal: What
[2025-03-07T18:33:32] Yamal: 🦦
[2025-03-07T18:33:38] Yamal: This is nice xD
[2025-03-07T18:34:02] haku: nvm. its the mats you wrestle in. if not cleaned you get some infections
[2025-03-07T18:34:21] Yamal: What you mean
[2025-03-07T18:34:28] Yamal: Clean what
[2025-03-07T18:34:38] haku: wrestling mats
[2025-03-07T18:34:58] Yamal: Ah
[2025-03-07T18:35:01] Yamal: XD
[2025-03-07T18:35:08] Yamal: 🤼
[2025-03-07T18:35:16] haku: ill find some photos of my old fights
[2025-03-07T18:37:16] haku: i dont know if my son is ready for that life yet. 5 years old. bones still fragile but i want him to learn discipline thru that
[2025-03-07T18:37:35] Yamal: Nice
[2025-03-07T18:38:30] Yamal: All fights are good, some more harmful than others. I used to do somersaults and sing in Portuguese in the capoeira circles.
[2025-03-07T18:38:38] Yamal: XD
[2025-03-07T18:38:59] haku: some parts of eastern europe have them train as early as 5
[2025-03-07T18:39:00] Yamal: There were very explosive female bodies xD
[2025-03-07T19:51:25] Roby MacGyver: please help me to configure control switch on vesc tool 🙏

[2025-03-07T20:30:34] haku: i like to do that too. keep batteries next to flamable liquid. i get a rush
[2025-03-07T20:31:13] haku: you may or may not ignite it. who knows
[2025-03-07T20:35:20] Yamal: I just take out the liquid sorry teacher
[2025-03-07T20:35:26] Yamal: 🦦
[2025-03-07T20:36:21] haku: no dont say sorry. i do the same
[2025-03-07T20:36:47] Yamal: <video_file>
[2025-03-07T20:37:00] haku: specially while welding. watching the sparks fly might or might not ignite it.
[2025-03-07T20:37:47] haku: looking good
[2025-03-07T20:41:56] haku: you lied to me you said you were from eu. this looks like america. fed help
[2025-03-07T20:43:25] haku: true
[2025-03-07T20:43:43] haku: i imagine eu with beautiful historical buildings
[2025-03-07T20:51:01] Matte: thank god we dont have suburbia

[2025-03-07T21:18:24] haku: its just rural and city life there?
[2025-03-07T21:18:31] haku: no hood?
[2025-03-07T21:19:13] Matte: either rural or city, there isnt a law forbidding a market in the neighborhood for example
[2025-03-07T21:34:26] Yamal: <video_file>
[2025-03-07T21:35:33] Yamal: Just there is not enough space
[2025-03-07T21:35:36] Yamal: Lolololol
[2025-03-07T21:35:44] Yamal: 😂
[2025-03-07T21:43:31] haku: ooh yea.
[2025-03-07T21:44:13] haku: fitment is perfect. try with a disc brake
[2025-03-07T21:45:26] Yamal: Can’t
[2025-03-07T21:45:49] haku: why not? dont you have extras somewhere?
[2025-03-07T21:46:28] Yamal: I need longer screws, I have attached it to see them, but I need more space, I can't even put the nut on top.
[2025-03-07T21:46:39] haku: oh i see
[2025-03-07T21:46:59] Yamal: 🕊️💸
[2025-03-07T21:47:18] haku: blessings will come. just wait. it always comes

[2025-03-07T22:17:39] Roby MacGyver: no nothing changes for the moment
[2025-03-07T22:18:01] JPPL: Need good studing and costum work
[2025-03-07T22:18:48] Roby MacGyver: I also set it to turn off after 10s and nothing stays on, I'm definitely doing something wrong
[2025-03-07T22:19:26] JPPL: Did tou write it? Try Turn off by Hand and then Turn again on and check if turns off
[2025-03-07T22:19:46] JPPL: Btw wich button you are using?
[2025-03-07T22:20:46] Roby MacGyver: yes i try
[2025-03-07T22:21:05] Roby MacGyver: no button I thought worked like that
[2025-03-07T22:22:50] Roby MacGyver: if I join the two wires without using a button after ten seconds should it turn off?
[2025-03-07T22:23:24] Roby MacGyver: but on the five volt I connected the accelerator
[2025-03-07T22:38:55] JPPL: Need to be momentary on that One
[2025-03-07T23:09:23] Roby MacGyver: sorry I didn't understand what you mean
[2025-03-07T23:40:02] Mattia: hi, can you recommend me a vesc that supports at least 200/250a from battery and 300a phase?
[2025-03-07T23:43:11] 'lekrsu': Spintend 85240 enough? ;)
[2025-03-07T23:45:45] Mattia: do the mosfets support 300a?
[2025-03-08T00:31:07] haku: dam lowered cybertruck.
[2025-03-08T00:31:07] haku: <photos/photo_21853@08-03-2025_00-31-07.jpg>
[2025-03-08T00:33:04] JPPL: Just little Touch, no need to BE permenently
[2025-03-08T00:33:36] JPPL: You can do that test, Touch cables 1 sec, and seperate, ctrl must Turn on
[2025-03-08T00:33:50] JPPL: To Turn off, Touch cables again 3 sec
[2025-03-08T00:34:21] JPPL: Phase yes
[2025-03-08T00:43:36] JPPL: Testing inputs, ADC all checked, can shared, on/off
[2025-03-08T00:43:36] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. JPPL has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.

[2025-03-08T02:18:52] JPPL: I dont know
[2025-03-08T02:19:22] haku: i expect a good warranty with these tronics since its local
[2025-03-08T02:19:33] JPPL: Im protectong their stuff also só it should cover. But not easyyy to remove for repair maybe
[2025-03-08T02:21:32] haku: that setup you have is so compact. good job dude. what motors and battery you using?

[2025-03-08T03:30:08] JPPL: Overmodulation
[2025-03-08T03:30:12] haku: thats should be plenty. that vehicle is broken atm.
[2025-03-08T03:30:22] JPPL: Even Higher speed capable
[2025-03-08T03:31:02] haku: i want to try these x12s someday though. the "sale" price on the boards isnt too bad
[2025-03-08T03:31:04] JPPL: So all theory can make it beat 173 world record
[2025-03-08T03:31:10] JPPL: That i never Saw video Proof.

[2025-03-08T03:32:25] haku: i just want burnouts to be honest
[2025-03-08T03:32:44] haku: that old zero build you had made me build one just like it
[2025-03-08T03:34:43] JPPL: 😍 lovely to hear that it works!
[2025-03-08T03:34:51] JPPL: Good building time
[2025-03-08T04:25:51] Dimos: Where is this option? Are you running beta?
[2025-03-08T05:40:31] Yamal: 👏
[2025-03-08T05:44:01] Yamal: What madness, that 11x is unstoppable
[2025-03-08T05:56:46] Yamal: There is a new tourist attraction in your country! JPPL scooter, vesc museum! 🦦
[2025-03-08T06:00:19] Yamal: I will try to fit the 80h for a few hours, and if it really cannot be achieved, I will have to make longer screws for the swingarms.
[2025-03-08T06:00:19] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-03-08T07:45:57] Roby MacGyver: ahh ok perfect i doing to try

[2025-03-08T13:16:15] JPPL: It need to BE larger a little bit? Yeahh main Axis fom arms need to BE longer, suspnsion part is more easy
[2025-03-08T13:17:01] GABE: Too long!
[2025-03-08T13:17:08] GABE: Thought I'd get away with 2 drills but I'll need 4.
[2025-03-08T13:17:32] GABE: The length makes these motors look small asf everything fits according to blueprint
[2025-03-08T13:17:40] GABE: <photos/photo_21858@08-03-2025_13-17-40.jpg>

[2025-03-08T13:25:32] GABE: Glad its here.
[2025-03-08T13:32:53] GABE: jan, youre the physicist, draw for me where the motor should be.
[2025-03-08T13:32:58] GABE: please.
[2025-03-08T13:33:17] GABE: seems i wont be fitting 4s6p behind there for sure, itll be too long then..
[2025-03-08T13:40:22] Jan: See daniels project
[2025-03-08T13:40:30] Jan: 11inch
[2025-03-08T13:44:39] Finn: Hey Guys, I turned "Pairing Done" on my Rear Vesc to on. Do i really need to connect it via usb now to turn it off?
[2025-03-08T13:49:39] Yamal: Y0000000000000000
[2025-03-08T13:49:45] Yamal: 😭
[2025-03-08T13:49:54] Yamal: Finally man
[2025-03-08T13:52:30] GABE: Even half this space would be killer
[2025-03-08T13:52:33] GABE: <video_file>
[2025-03-08T13:54:22] GABE: I gotta fix that goddamn welder dawg my cash is so dry

[2025-03-08T13:56:03] GABE: I'm already 2.4k in.

[2025-03-08T14:04:00] JPPL: Yes :(
[2025-03-08T14:04:55] JPPL: Wait for Seven products
[2025-03-08T14:09:43] Yamal: I am really confused about your projects, there are so many scooters and so many electronic things that I get lost, a tourist guide is needed.
[2025-03-08T14:12:00] JPPL: Im Addicted, i Will get married, need to buy now 😂
[2025-03-08T14:14:10] JPPL: My projects Change time to time, my main One is speed chasse and performance. then i love to make experiments, since drones beggining time i build stuff
[2025-03-08T14:24:16] Yamal: You can open a television channel if you want, I would watch it 🦦

[2025-03-08T14:51:15] Roby MacGyver: What setting should I use to be able to give more thrust at the start and more torque?
[2025-03-08T14:56:24] JPPL: Nor running yet, its new on 6.06 beta and Saw some good reports on speed increase
[2025-03-08T15:04:08] JPPL: APP cfg, ADC menu, positive ramping time to 0.1
[2025-03-08T15:04:58] JPPL: Throthle curve mode add some %
[2025-03-08T15:05:33] JPPL: Also batt amps and phase amps in motor cfg , current tab
[2025-03-08T15:07:23] Finn: shit
[2025-03-08T15:28:33] Roby MacGyver: this ok
[2025-03-08T15:28:45] Roby MacGyver: also this
[2025-03-08T15:29:09] Roby MacGyver: but this i dont understand
[2025-03-08T15:53:50] JPPL: How much are you using batt amps and current amps? On motor cfg tab on vesc tools/current tab
[2025-03-08T15:57:40] GABE: No space for 4s6p after remeasuring. Only 2s6p. Still 22s6p all internal tho?
[2025-03-08T15:57:49] GABE: Kinda cool.
[2025-03-08T15:58:17] GABE: motor gonna be pulled up front ALOT. for accurate geometry
[2025-03-08T16:00:58] Yamal: You have speed motors right
[2025-03-08T16:14:09] GABE: no 22x3
[2025-03-08T16:14:16] GABE: 70h
[2025-03-08T16:15:48] JPPL: Draft mode 😍
[2025-03-08T16:21:52] Yamal: 🌫️
[2025-03-08T16:24:28] Yamal: 🇸🇪
[2025-03-08T16:56:12] haku: i drew you one. thats very offensive to me boy.
[2025-03-08T16:57:40] haku: daniel is 11?
[2025-03-08T17:00:44] haku: atleast you can fit 13 tires with that gap. you be the first g30 on 13"
[2025-03-08T17:02:38] Yamal: Good idea
[2025-03-08T17:03:45] haku: why not fit a qsmotor. huge gap.
[2025-03-08T17:04:24] GABE: Nah cos front can only hold 11
[2025-03-08T17:04:34] GABE: If it could hold more I would've done so
[2025-03-08T17:04:49] haku: true
[2025-03-08T17:04:50] Yamal: <video_file>
[2025-03-08T17:05:10] GABE: Im thinking of thinner side PMTS for more range.
[2025-03-08T17:05:12] haku: im jealous of these spring projects you guys doing
[2025-03-08T17:05:22] GABE: so not 110
[2025-03-08T17:05:26] GABE: 100 or 90 maybe
[2025-03-08T17:05:26] GABE: 95
[2025-03-08T17:06:27] GABE: accel scares me on 25h single
[2025-03-08T17:06:41] haku: 70h is a different beast
[2025-03-08T17:07:00] GABE: I can't fathom what the performance will be dude
[2025-03-08T17:07:17] GABE: jetson Vs dual 70h 22x3
[2025-03-08T17:07:36] haku: qsmotor jetson sure
[2025-03-08T17:07:38] GABE: 4.7kw to 20kw
[2025-03-08T17:07:42] GABE: 4x more power
[2025-03-08T17:08:11] GABE: I'll be peaking and monitoring those poor p42as so hard
[2025-03-08T17:08:53] haku: what configuration you doing again?
[2025-03-08T17:08:54] GABE: 22s should compensate.
[2025-03-08T17:09:00] GABE: 20s6p
[2025-03-08T17:09:16] GABE: I'll make a 10s P45b when I get a job
[2025-03-08T17:09:27] GABE: those motors shouldn't handle 30kw tho
[2025-03-08T17:09:48] GABE: 40hp
[2025-03-08T17:09:48] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. GABE has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-03-08T17:09:56] haku: the new bak is comparable to p45 but more affordable but less cycle life
[2025-03-08T17:10:27] haku: dam i wish we had these china cells in the US
[2025-03-08T17:22:52] haku: be sure to get a prenup just incase or she will take half your scooters
[2025-03-08T17:56:53] Roby MacGyver: i tryed this set but i dont like because it gives a sharp blow to the engine but as a torque it doesn't change much
[2025-03-08T17:58:42] francois schempers: phase amps mostly define the torque you have, what's your controller ?
[2025-03-08T18:04:23] Roby MacGyver: makerbase 75100
[2025-03-08T18:05:22] Roby MacGyver: I can't find this phase amp in the settings
[2025-03-08T18:07:09] Jan: Not daniel.from switzerland, thr other one
[2025-03-08T18:08:42] haku: i see
[2025-03-08T18:08:52] haku: the rion looking one. i remember
[2025-03-08T18:18:08] GABE: customer wanted new tyres
[2025-03-08T18:18:17] GABE: i said does 35 a pop sound good
[2025-03-08T18:18:27] GABE: I'm getting paid 70 :)
[2025-03-08T18:18:55] GABE: Mijia is out of service I'll take the tyres from that.
[2025-03-08T18:34:53] francois schempers: current tab, motor cfg, current
[2025-03-08T18:45:00] haku: yes!
[2025-03-08T18:46:24] haku: dam they did not provide thermal pads
[2025-03-08T18:55:57] Yamal: Finally
[2025-03-08T18:56:10] Yamal: Yes !
[2025-03-08T18:56:12] Yamal: Hehe
[2025-03-08T18:56:32] haku: sorry when i get excited i call my dog names
[2025-03-08T18:57:01] Yamal: It’s okay , is your friend
[2025-03-08T18:57:12] haku: its a very rare medical disorder
[2025-03-08T18:58:13] Yamal: It’s just easy to install ?
[2025-03-08T18:58:36] haku: yes. very easy. just solder new plugs and paste or pads
[2025-03-08T18:59:15] haku: i will not break this one.
[2025-03-08T19:02:34] haku: first and formost before i start on fixing wepoor. need to change tire on jetson because once i focus on one i cant multitask
[2025-03-08T19:03:44] Yamal: Help him with Wepoor scooterBike
[2025-03-08T19:04:02] haku: in the name of vedder i will
[2025-03-08T19:04:24] haku: cast out these fardriver demons into the void where they belong
[2025-03-08T19:05:19] haku: everything that ive created is vesc based so im not straying away from it
[2025-03-08T19:06:48] Yamal: Hehe🔥
[2025-03-08T19:06:53] Yamal: 🦦
[2025-03-08T19:07:36] haku: if this breaks ill fix the next one or get x12 and have em deal with it
[2025-03-08T19:08:33] Yamal: you could have found a good heat sink in all this time, man!
[2025-03-08T19:09:37] haku: that dual x12 like @XgunaX is very compact.
[2025-03-08T19:14:20] JPPL: Show morrer
[2025-03-08T19:15:10] haku: its just 12 fet spintend powerstage
[2025-03-08T19:15:23] haku: my 6th one
[2025-03-08T19:16:28] haku: 18fet spintend im still waiting
[2025-03-08T19:16:45] haku: i was hoping before tarrif
[2025-03-08T19:17:50] Yamal: We are talking about the spintend solution, not the x12, which even seeing that square PCB gives me chills, I think time will heal it xD
[2025-03-08T19:18:49] haku: cooling solution for my wepoor need custom mounting.
[2025-03-08T19:18:57] haku: cnc is expensive
[2025-03-08T19:21:12] GABE: Therefore me doing 4 steel beams
[2025-03-08T19:21:45] GABE: No space for exterinternal 2s 🥲
[2025-03-08T19:21:55] GABE: 6p is enough anyway lmao
[2025-03-08T19:21:58] GABE: who cares
[2025-03-08T19:22:34] haku: <video_file>
[2025-03-08T19:22:47] haku: i will try. it will cost alot for cnc solution
[2025-03-08T19:24:15] haku: like watercool?
[2025-03-08T19:24:47] haku: oh gotcha. thats the thing i cant design shit haha
[2025-03-08T19:26:02] haku: here is another option.
[2025-03-08T19:29:05] haku: gotcha. i have some alu heatsink fins. need it cut
[2025-03-08T19:29:58] haku: i have to measure. but it can fit 85250 i believe
[2025-03-08T19:30:07] haku: just 1
[2025-03-08T19:30:34] haku: theres alot of space just needs special cnc mounting
[2025-03-08T19:30:47] GABE: Show the freewheel Raw accel power
[2025-03-08T19:30:52] GABE: what's the max you've peaked on it?
[2025-03-08T19:30:57] GABE: You have 12p after all sooo
[2025-03-08T19:31:05] haku: yes i have something similar
[2025-03-08T19:31:11] GABE: with FWK. Just you better have mech brakes
[2025-03-08T19:31:11] haku: ill try get it cut
[2025-03-08T19:31:26] haku: gotcha.
[2025-03-08T19:31:33] GABE: I wanna hear that baby whine
[2025-03-08T19:31:43] GABE: If you get it you get it
[2025-03-08T19:32:17] haku: im not even running it hot @jamessoderstrom. im just walking dog speeds and decided to gun it. it might be cutoff maybe woke bms settings
[2025-03-08T19:32:41] haku: i will need you powers to figure this out the settings
[2025-03-08T19:33:13] haku: true. i will not go on highways anymore. learned my lesson
[2025-03-08T19:33:40] haku: i see
[2025-03-08T19:37:44] haku: i never did that
[2025-03-08T19:37:58] haku: i always test on road
[2025-03-08T19:38:24] haku: 26kw on the hy mosfets
[2025-03-08T19:45:05] Yamal: VESC inside maybe,,?
[2025-03-08T19:49:17] haku: maybe yes. ill figure something out
[2025-03-08T19:54:50] Yamal: Maybe,,? Don’t know
[2025-03-08T19:55:49] haku: i considered that too. but jank looking
[2025-03-08T19:56:52] haku: anyways enough thinking about this for now. squat day baby.
[2025-03-08T19:57:15] Yamal: But I guess that direct VESC mounted on the heatsink is the most efficient.
[2025-03-08T19:57:18] haku: swole and projects. it goes hand in hand
[2025-03-08T19:59:20] Yamal: When you can, make a full wepoor video where we play tetris
[2025-03-08T20:01:13] Yamal: Don't worry, helicopters usually fly in the morning, there are no raids now.
[2025-03-08T20:02:04] Yamal: I did squats and shoulders before, but of course not with 200kg
[2025-03-08T20:03:20] Yamal: I hope that your training goes well, think about the chocolate bars you will eat afterwards as a reward.
[2025-03-08T20:05:07] haku: this is the mood right now @jamaludin_algarnati https://youtu.be/iWa-6g-TbgI?si=WfEnIcs8lczSYGig
[2025-03-08T20:06:19] haku: rick james bitches!
[2025-03-08T20:08:41] Yamal: https://youtu.be/tMYBTSm-Hx0?si=wX61seQsrSpXLILb
[2025-03-08T20:09:01] Yamal: 🙂‍↔️👌
[2025-03-08T20:18:53] Yamal: https://youtu.be/EUcwTITY4wE?si=VrvJRryA9_pnHTNF
[2025-03-08T20:19:24] Yamal: It’s just from my city 😑🫨🤣
[2025-03-08T20:19:34] haku: idk about these new rappers man. they are doing too much
[2025-03-08T20:20:22] haku: i dont listen to it. i have no idea who these new rappers are
[2025-03-08T20:21:43] haku: here. my politics has changed over the years but this still a banger. https://youtu.be/GdTiZB0wjs0?si=iEW9FzKE688MBAJX
[2025-03-08T20:23:58] Yamal: Me too 😅/ I’m reggae music 24/7
[2025-03-08T20:24:43] haku: this one i listen too when pick my dogs poop. https://youtu.be/3sQOOZv_CYM?si=ljZp2b7ih-OtNTRy
[2025-03-08T20:25:06] Yamal: You started with the word bitches, he keeps saying that word, that's why I remembered xD
[2025-03-08T20:35:08] haku: you prolly dont know about the legendary rick james
[2025-03-08T20:35:33] Yamal: Don’t know man
[2025-03-08T20:35:40] haku: ok. no worries
[2025-03-08T20:36:04] Yamal: You know about Camarón de la Isla ?
[2025-03-08T20:36:13] haku: no no
[2025-03-08T20:36:24] Yamal: Same
[2025-03-08T20:36:25] Yamal: XD
[2025-03-08T20:36:27] haku: but i like the french singer alizee.
[2025-03-08T20:36:34] haku: you know her?
[2025-03-08T20:36:55] Yamal: Alizze ? I seach
[2025-03-08T20:37:13] Yamal: Nop
[2025-03-08T20:37:17] Yamal: Never listen
[2025-03-08T20:37:32] haku: ok. i listen to everything
[2025-03-08T20:37:45] Patrick: I want to try a 85240 in my pro2 to push the full 250A
[2025-03-08T20:37:53] Yamal: Wouh
[2025-03-08T20:37:59] Patrick: Would a cap swap work
[2025-03-08T20:38:08] Patrick: On 85240 could fit it then with a full custom heatsink
[2025-03-08T20:38:10] Yamal: When ?
[2025-03-08T20:38:19] haku: do it. what motor?
[2025-03-08T20:38:27] Patrick: 65H 17x4 delta
[2025-03-08T20:38:56] haku: 17x4 can take 250. impressive
[2025-03-08T20:39:14] Patrick: But what caps
[2025-03-08T20:39:22] Patrick: Delta should make it possible
[2025-03-08T20:39:33] Patrick: Need little smaller once if possible
[2025-03-08T20:39:58] haku: i dont know anything about it. try dude. might be good stuff
[2025-03-08T20:40:12] Yamal: The best option for a single engine is 17/4 and 16/4, right? 22/3 and 33/2 are not available?
[2025-03-08T20:40:30] Patrick: First i do the 150A test run probably next weekend should be 100km/h+. After the run i put a external 20s2p on it and a New v0.6 mp2 build for higher discharge
[2025-03-08T20:40:31] Yamal: asking
[2025-03-08T20:40:42] Patrick: And of the v0.6 limits me i would try 85240
[2025-03-08T20:40:52] haku: 22x3 with alot of amps im not sure but defenitely not 33x2
[2025-03-08T20:40:52] Patrick: 16x4/17x4>>>
[2025-03-08T20:41:24] Patrick: Or wait
[2025-03-08T20:41:34] Yamal: 🦦
[2025-03-08T20:41:38] Patrick: I have 40mm height at the 1 Spot where the caps are
[2025-03-08T20:41:52] Patrick: 8mm heatsink & 85240 without case barely fits but could work
[2025-03-08T20:41:58] Patrick: Hmm
[2025-03-08T20:42:12] Patrick: Should i try it
[2025-03-08T20:42:40] Patrick: 3d printing test parts then and if they fit i order a 85240 next month after external is finished
[2025-03-08T20:42:40] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Patrick has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-03-08T20:43:00] haku: yea only way is to test
[2025-03-08T20:43:01] Yamal: The pro2 is taking you a long time to finish, but it will definitely remain Maseratti
[2025-03-08T20:43:40] Yamal: Also i really like the color
[2025-03-08T20:44:36] Yamal: He will be a wolf in sheep's clothing and will cut more than a katana
[2025-03-08T20:48:20] Patrick: Money only
[2025-03-08T20:49:57] Yamal: I'm getting more and more excited about small scooter projects, how difficult it is to put everything together,
[2025-03-08T20:51:33] Yamal: Now is when Jan would come in saying: - if you had 10k euros what would you do ^^' he is an expert in twisting the twist
[2025-03-08T20:52:19] haku: yea man. build a small one
[2025-03-08T20:52:53] Yamal: To this day there is no one who has won his project
[2025-03-08T20:53:07] haku: but dont get sidetract on the project big balls
[2025-03-08T20:53:43] Yamal: I have sold the dt thunder😭
[2025-03-08T20:53:52] Yamal: 🦦😂
[2025-03-08T20:54:00] haku: really dam
[2025-03-08T20:54:03] haku: why?
[2025-03-08T20:54:15] haku: i thought 80h was for it
[2025-03-08T20:54:33] Yamal: I told you, I'm running out of alone time"
[2025-03-08T20:54:57] haku: understandable. hopefully you did not sell on a loss
[2025-03-08T20:56:02] Yamal: No, I sold it for a little profit, I'm also selling the RFP frame,
[2025-03-08T20:56:46] Yamal: The G2 era is coming
[2025-03-08T20:56:53] haku: ok good.
[2025-03-08T20:57:04] haku: no monetary loss is good
[2025-03-08T20:57:14] haku: just time
[2025-03-08T20:57:22] Yamal: I have the nami disassembled
[2025-03-08T20:57:50] haku: you bought a g2?
[2025-03-08T20:57:59] Yamal: Yes today xD
[2025-03-08T20:58:06] Yamal: Monday they send me
[2025-03-08T20:58:09] haku: make a bike dude. wtf
[2025-03-08T20:58:49] Yamal: No feel
[2025-03-08T20:59:15] haku: since your going stock g2 speeds might aswel sit down
[2025-03-08T20:59:20] Yamal: The laws in my country for electric bikes are also complicated.
[2025-03-08T20:59:29] haku: i see
[2025-03-08T21:00:13] Yamal: I bought it to see if my wife is motivated to drive the G2
[2025-03-08T21:00:29] haku: thats the way. get her into scooters
[2025-03-08T21:00:37] haku: then buy the parts haha
[2025-03-08T21:00:55] Yamal: But also for me, as of today I am without a vehicle and my little brother's mijia is cursing me
[2025-03-08T21:01:20] haku: xiaomi isnt bad. but your so used to nami
[2025-03-08T21:01:45] haku: like wepoor to jetson. same feeling i guess
[2025-03-08T21:02:38] Yamal: The Nami never ends, I need to change the axle to steel and longer "axles" for the arms, I'm a little tired
[2025-03-08T21:02:41] haku: small is good man. so portable. throw it anywhere
[2025-03-08T21:06:19] Yamal: The good thing about big vehicles is the routes and the glorious 11" engines. I have done 2500km with the Spintend in just a few months.
[2025-03-08T21:06:55] haku: yes you live in rural area not city. thats really fun. no rules
[2025-03-08T21:07:12] haku: you dont have to worry about cars too seems like
[2025-03-08T21:08:12] Yamal: I will soon go to live in the city, leaving the region behind, but from my city it is easy to escape to the mountains or the countryside.
[2025-03-08T21:08:21] haku: if i was you. you live in the country side buy a surron.
[2025-03-08T21:08:37] Yamal: I like kick scooter

[2025-03-08T21:09:23] haku: sitdown lifestyle even with kick scooter
[2025-03-08T21:09:34] Yamal: E-scooter for me it’s fun absolutely freedom
[2025-03-08T21:11:05] haku: dangerous here in america. road speeds 35-45mph. on tiny tires potholes is a deathwish
[2025-03-08T21:11:46] haku: highway speeds 65-75mph but cant do it now unfortunately
[2025-03-08T21:12:11] Yamal: The truth is that I wouldn't buy an electric motorcycle or bike, not for nothing, they have never attracted me, although I have had a motorcycle and a bike but I don't know, to have a good time the e-scooter motivates me, it was born out of necessity, from necessity it became a hobby and the hobby became a passion
[2025-03-08T21:12:37] haku: thats good man! passion of the nami
[2025-03-08T21:13:13] haku: i fell inlove with a laotie once
[2025-03-08T21:13:20] Yamal: If I think about a large vehicle for the future, it is a van to enjoy with the family.

[2025-03-08T21:13:52] haku: then bikes in the back

[2025-03-08T21:14:14] haku: i want to get him a scooter too
[2025-03-08T21:14:29] haku: but last time he wiped out and cut his chin
[2025-03-08T21:14:44] haku: my boy
[2025-03-08T21:14:56] Yamal: Look for a 4 in case you fall in love again xD, you don't want to take her tied up in the back of the car

[2025-03-09T11:15:27] GABE: pic 1 (new) is pushed about 15cm up. "fixes geometry" because it's close to where the original dropouts are. Original dropouts will be CUT or no space for brakes
[2025-03-09T11:16:28] GABE: I need to sand that orange, looks disgusting. I'll have to paint to the same colour as rear.
[2025-03-09T11:19:01] GABE: @AJAJ1992 why on earth must they be orange 😭😭😭 Btw turns out this wouldn't be possible with v2 forks. thank god I was greedy and have two v1s.

[2025-03-09T11:26:55] Jan: I didnt paint them
[2025-03-09T11:44:32] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Try changing the controller throttle if when detecting the engine it works well I think the problem is in the throttle
[2025-03-09T11:45:22] Arnau Martinez Casals: No, it was bad hall
[2025-03-09T11:45:42] Arnau Martinez Casals: Burned the hall when burned the 85150 esc
[2025-03-09T11:46:23] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Then you know how to push the engine with your hand.
[2025-03-09T11:46:40] Arnau Martinez Casals: I cant set it well sensorless, going very bad
[2025-03-09T11:47:03] Arnau Martinez Casals: <video_file>
[2025-03-09T11:47:36] Arnau Martinez Casals: No, it won’t , it starts when it wants most of times doing bad
[2025-03-09T11:47:39] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: use vss sensor but you will have to configure it
[2025-03-09T11:47:56] Arnau Martinez Casals: What is that
[2025-03-09T11:48:59] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It is another type of sensor that Vesc uses
[2025-03-09T11:50:15] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: That's not Hall's problem
[2025-03-09T11:50:34] Arnau Martinez Casals: Bad detection
[2025-03-09T11:50:54] Arnau Martinez Casals: When do motor detection say sensorless
[2025-03-09T11:51:01] Arnau Martinez Casals: <photos/photo_21881@09-03-2025_11-51-01.jpg>
[2025-03-09T11:52:16] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: When it stops, it gives you some parameters. If those parameters are almost equal, the motors are fine, that is, the detection was done well.
[2025-03-09T11:52:30] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: but they have to be configured
[2025-03-09T11:53:24] Arnau Martinez Casals: Not detecting
[2025-03-09T11:53:53] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If you push the engine and then accelerate does it work fine?
[2025-03-09T11:54:01] Arnau Martinez Casals: No
[2025-03-09T11:54:15] Arnau Martinez Casals: When it wants spin when it wants no
[2025-03-09T11:54:26] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: That's not a sensor problem
[2025-03-09T11:54:37] Arnau Martinez Casals: Bro
[2025-03-09T11:54:46] Arnau Martinez Casals: Is not detecting the hall
[2025-03-09T11:55:27] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: The engine works with or without hall that is not a problem for Vesc
[2025-03-09T11:55:36] Arnau Martinez Casals: I know
[2025-03-09T11:55:52] Arnau Martinez Casals: But runs better with hall
[2025-03-09T11:56:41] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, but if you push the engine with your hand and then accelerate but the engine does not work, that is not the problem.
[2025-03-09T11:58:01] Tristan: <video_file>
[2025-03-09T11:58:01] Tristan: Why do i keep getting over current cuttoffs

[2025-03-09T12:35:20] Smart Repair: maybe Fets broken
[2025-03-09T12:41:22] Arnau Martinez Casals: Says faul overvoltaje, not abs
[2025-03-09T12:42:06] Arnau Martinez Casals: Check out your battery voltaje and discharge capacity

[2025-03-09T12:48:46] Tristan: It says undervoltage, BC the bms cuts off
[2025-03-09T12:49:18] Tristan: From the controller?
[2025-03-09T12:49:22] Arnau Martinez Casals: So its bms discharge?
[2025-03-09T12:50:01] Tristan: Yes, you can see in the clip
[2025-03-09T12:57:09] Smart Repair: BMS Fet
[2025-03-09T12:57:40] Arnau Martinez Casals: Which bms is it?
[2025-03-09T12:57:51] Smart Repair: If the settings are correct, BMS are replaced and the problem is gone
[2025-03-09T12:58:06] Tristan: JBD-SP17S005
[2025-03-09T12:58:10] Arnau Martinez Casals: I only use JK Or Ant
[2025-03-09T12:58:26] JPPL: What a beast! Would BE Nice to have their config
[2025-03-09T12:58:32] Tristan: Fuck
[2025-03-09T12:59:05] Arnau Martinez Casals: Or daly
[2025-03-09T12:59:37] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: For me Daly is the worst ☺️
[2025-03-09T13:00:11] Arnau Martinez Casals: Daly is good for low current discharge until 60a
[2025-03-09T13:00:32] Arnau Martinez Casals: My 20s running JK 100a peak200
[2025-03-09T13:00:45] Arnau Martinez Casals: My 16s jk 200 peak 300
[2025-03-09T13:03:12] Tristan: What does that have to do with it?
[2025-03-09T13:03:59] Arnau Martinez Casals: <video_file>
[2025-03-09T13:04:32] Basti: yes but i don,t have the amps and controller fot it
[2025-03-09T13:06:57] Smart Repair: Open ADC mapping and see if you get a brake signal.
[2025-03-09T13:07:21] Arnau Martinez Casals: No brake regen Or input setted
[2025-03-09T13:07:29] Arnau Martinez Casals: Only adc input
[2025-03-09T13:08:10] Arnau Martinez Casals: It finally spins but it has problems to start running as you can see
[2025-03-09T13:08:48] Arnau Martinez Casals: Giving a push is not all
[2025-03-09T13:09:16] Jason: how many mosfet does it have
[2025-03-09T13:09:22] Jason: my 40a version has 4
[2025-03-09T13:10:10] Tristan: 6
[2025-03-09T13:10:23] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: As I told you before, it is not a sensor problem, but I will still tell you how to configure VSS.
[2025-03-09T13:11:28] Arnau Martinez Casals: How is not to be a sensor problem, other thing is that can i set without it
[2025-03-09T13:11:39] Arnau Martinez Casals: But it not recognizes hall
[2025-03-09T13:13:03] Jason: mmm
[2025-03-09T13:13:08] Jason: thanks
[2025-03-09T13:13:44] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: The engine does not turn when you push it, that problem is not with the sensors.
[2025-03-09T13:15:06] Arnau Martinez Casals: Im saying it finally spins
[2025-03-09T13:15:10] JPPL: Save it and send me 😊💋💋💋💋

[2025-03-09T15:49:50] Yamal: I know, man, just a simple video. I found them and I thought it was funny to see so many together.
[2025-03-09T15:52:50] Yamal: This is called "bikini operation"
[2025-03-09T15:54:52] Yamal: The truth is that I knew they were poisonous and that you can't touch them, but I didn't know about the noise and that you expel hair.🎩
[2025-03-09T16:06:14] Pandalgns: Yes, if you are looking for videos ... they move very sharply to the rhythm of the noise and with those movements they expel the hair
[2025-03-09T16:39:46] haku: go to a local machine shop. talk to the machinist tell em its for a school project. im sure they will cut it at a low cost. maybe free.

[2025-03-09T21:43:16] haku: its not turning on?
[2025-03-09T21:44:41] haku: see if you burnt anything
[2025-03-09T21:44:51] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Open now
[2025-03-09T21:45:23] haku: this is beyond my expertise
[2025-03-09T21:45:41] haku: a higher power needs to take a look at this
[2025-03-09T21:46:26] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Who is available this time ?
[2025-03-09T21:46:43] haku: just wait. dm james
[2025-03-09T21:48:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: How do I check what died ?
[2025-03-09T21:48:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_21899@09-03-2025_21-48-22.jpg>
[2025-03-09T21:54:49] haku: my guess is somewhere here is fucked. not sure
[2025-03-09T21:55:22] haku: thats a guess.
[2025-03-09T21:56:29] haku: how did you short it? wrong wires? are you using adc module?
[2025-03-09T21:57:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Not using I tried to take power from that for lights and stuff
[2025-03-09T21:57:44] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And I'm a moron
[2025-03-09T21:57:54] haku: oh dam
[2025-03-09T21:57:56] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The wires touched eace others
[2025-03-09T21:58:37] haku: whatever the stepdown on that 12v rail is my guess. im not sure
[2025-03-09T22:02:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Maybe I'll replace the upper stage?
[2025-03-09T22:02:29] Yamal: Always ask before touching anything, what a shame, the new VESC
[2025-03-09T22:03:20] Yamal: I prefer to go to bed to sleep, without first confirming that everything is correct.
[2025-03-09T22:03:21] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'll see what's fixable for now I have 75200
[2025-03-09T22:03:32] Yamal: Sorry man
[2025-03-09T22:03:48] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And does the make problems when can (85150x75200?)
[2025-03-09T22:04:06] francois schempers: <video_file>
[2025-03-09T22:04:51] Yamal: 85/240 was your big goal for the thunder with the intention of putting 2 x 85/240 in the future
[2025-03-09T22:05:02] haku: ask the experts. im sure it can be fixed
[2025-03-09T22:06:11] haku: did you hear a popping sound when shorted?
[2025-03-09T22:06:59] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I saa sparks
[2025-03-09T22:07:11] haku: dang
[2025-03-09T22:08:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I think I'll do 75200x85150 and try to get them to work in can
[2025-03-09T22:09:22] haku: wait answers first.
[2025-03-09T22:18:49] Yamal: Well, things happen to all of us... I drove the scooter for more than a kilometer with the motors facing in different directions, that is, the front wheel was turning forward and the back wheel was turning the other way, breaking the accelerator. I still don't know how I managed to do that.
[2025-03-09T22:20:14] Yamal: I thought... the scooter seems to be going slow, it has little power""....
[2025-03-09T22:20:30] Yamal: Hehe😓
[2025-03-09T22:24:28] Yamal: Shortly after putting the iron solutions in, a tremendously charged ray of light came through the storm, crossing an aurora borealis to save the situation. It came from somewhere in Sweden.,.,.,. ⚡️❤️‍🔥🫰
[2025-03-09T22:24:33] Yamal: 🦦
[2025-03-09T22:24:34] Rose: Yeah, I don't like your flooding. Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-03-09T22:47:36] haku: nothing beats 3 dead 85/250
[2025-03-09T22:47:45] haku: i still win
[2025-03-09T22:48:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What died power stage ?
[2025-03-09T22:49:07] haku: yep
[2025-03-09T22:49:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So u have upper pcb?
[2025-03-09T22:49:30] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Spare
[2025-03-09T22:49:40] haku: yea logic boards okay. just the mosfets
[2025-03-09T22:49:55] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But not spare
[2025-03-09T22:49:57] haku: fixable with proper tools and skill
[2025-03-09T22:50:01] haku: nope
[2025-03-09T22:50:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Whare do I get new logic board?
[2025-03-09T22:50:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: James said replace 12 buck
[2025-03-09T22:51:40] haku: james prolly has logic. or replace 12buck. im not a pro dude. ask him
[2025-03-09T22:52:02] haku: wich one is 12buck @jamessoderstrom
[2025-03-09T22:52:34] Yamal: Luckily I didn't break the VESC, only the accelerator. After that incident I have put more than 2500km on the indomitable one, stepping on the accelerator without fear and for a few days taking my configuration to 200A battery 200A phase as if the sun weren't going to come out tomorrow.
[2025-03-09T22:52:49] haku: on this board
[2025-03-09T22:53:19] haku: only idiots break vescs. no offense to anyone
[2025-03-09T22:53:28] Yamal: No no no
[2025-03-09T22:53:48] haku: my 6 fets running perfectly fine
[2025-03-09T22:53:55] Yamal: vesc is like a posh lady, you have to treat her well
[2025-03-09T22:54:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: What do u think
[2025-03-09T22:54:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Just do 75200*85150?
[2025-03-09T22:54:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And pray that can will be ok ?
[2025-03-09T22:54:44] haku: sure.
[2025-03-09T22:56:55] haku: the fardriver demons. they are whispering yamal. what should i do?
[2025-03-09T22:57:39] Yamal: But you have new power stage
[2025-03-09T22:57:54] Yamal: Why
[2025-03-09T22:58:12] haku: the demons said think 2 steps ahead. what if this blows up again
[2025-03-09T22:59:33] Yamal: Make sure you do it right, make sure that where you do the operation is clean and there are no pieces of tin hanging around and make sure that the configuration is correct.
[2025-03-09T22:59:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: @Bradhaku how hard is it to replace a logic board ?
[2025-03-09T23:01:50] haku: for mine. 2 screws
[2025-03-09T23:02:05] haku: <photos/photo_21902@09-03-2025_23-02-05.jpg>
[2025-03-09T23:02:40] Yamal: Before you press the power button, let me know! and I will send you a photo of the King
[2025-03-09T23:03:06] haku: the demons said phase cable melting power in your hands. just take it. its yours. i said back of demon in the name of vedder
[2025-03-09T23:06:14] Yamal: If everything goes well we will go in your Wepoor to Aspen
[2025-03-09T23:06:33] haku: yes. with a suitcase of money
[2025-03-09T23:08:59] Yamal: Sometimes I think it's hard to keep track of us
[2025-03-09T23:09:02] Yamal: 🦦
[2025-03-09T23:10:14] haku: i need to get this heatsink cut.
[2025-03-09T23:10:15] haku: <photos/photo_21904@09-03-2025_23-10-15.jpg>
[2025-03-09T23:10:39] haku: yea
[2025-03-09T23:10:56] haku: find a solution to mount it
[2025-03-09T23:11:51] haku: thats right. good idea
[2025-03-09T23:16:23] haku: yea mount like this.
[2025-03-09T23:16:24] haku: <photos/photo_21906@09-03-2025_23-16-24.jpg>
[2025-03-09T23:16:48] haku: need to jank something
[2025-03-09T23:21:11] haku: you are right
[2025-03-09T23:21:58] haku: i wish i had a metal bender machine.
[2025-03-09T23:22:05] haku: ill make something work
[2025-03-09T23:26:42] Yamal: <photos/photo_21907@09-03-2025_23-26-42.jpg>
[2025-03-09T23:27:54] Yamal: Maybe you could cut it leaving a strip, and cutting the first fin under the heatsink so you can screw it on?
[2025-03-09T23:29:06] Yamal: Your heatsink has the fins quite far apart, so I think it will be fine.
[2025-03-09T23:29:11] Yamal: Don’t know ..
[2025-03-09T23:33:09] haku: yea something like that. it has too look flush or i cant sleep
