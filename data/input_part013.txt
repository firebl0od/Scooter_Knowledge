Ptfe works, i was able to pull trough 6mm2 phases, but the insulation is soo fragile, its very easy to tear it. Even if its super duper heat resistant, its not bendy and sharp corner resistant.

[2025-06-05T14:22:06] Jose: Just some reprogramming and you have it
[2025-06-05T14:22:28] Yamal: The truth is that I'm not going to touch it until I put the complete Vesc kit on
[2025-06-05T14:23:23] Jose: Vesc at 36v?
[2025-06-05T14:23:33] Yamal: 3Shull 700/ or 3Shull 1400 dual 100h 33/2 engines and 50pl battery

[2025-06-05T14:25:19] Jose: 😂😂😂
[2025-06-05T14:25:38] Jose: I will have to modify for my motor and its just 50mm magnet
[2025-06-05T14:25:55] Yamal: I'm just kidding, ,, and why not?

[2025-06-05T14:27:08] Jose: Im so sure it fits 6p
[2025-06-05T14:27:20] Yamal: But 6 p dual okee

[2025-06-05T14:28:51] Jose: More p more autonomy

[2025-06-05T14:31:49] Yamal: Vesc scooter group
[2025-06-05T14:32:00] Yamal: English always
[2025-06-05T14:32:08] Jose: Aaah i dont know that rule
[2025-06-05T14:32:28] Jose: My fault

[2025-06-05T14:37:39] Jose: And more discharge current 😈
[2025-06-05T14:39:52] Yamal: I don't think they have a TikTok. They're serious people. There must be plenty of photos of their project in this group, but they're immersed in thousands of photos.
[2025-06-05T14:40:20] Jose: Aaah but how can i look for them
[2025-06-05T14:40:39] Yamal: Going the Segway Ninebot group

[2025-06-05T14:42:33] Jose: You have link?
[2025-06-05T14:43:10] Yamal: I was there before, but not anymore, I'll come back when I've installed 100 h
[2025-06-05T14:43:13] Yamal: No
[2025-06-05T14:43:37] Jose: 😔
[2025-06-05T14:43:45] Yamal: Let's see if someone shares a link
[2025-06-05T14:47:16] Yamal: What controllers do you plan to use?
[2025-06-05T14:47:23] Jose: 🙏🙏🙏
[2025-06-05T14:47:31] Jose: I have no idea yet
[2025-06-05T14:47:43] Jose: But something not really expensive
[2025-06-05T14:47:50] Jose: Like 100€
[2025-06-05T14:48:45] Jose: Do you recomend some models to me?
[2025-06-05T14:49:08] Jose: Because ive never touched vesc, other electronics yes but not vesc
[2025-06-05T14:50:02] Yamal: low price and high quality / spintend only
[2025-06-05T14:51:03] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Haaaa haha
[2025-06-05T14:51:17] Yamal: After you drive a Vesc, you'll be unable to drive anything else, and when you see minimotors and things like that, you'll want to cry, with all due respect.
[2025-06-05T14:51:21] Jose: https://a.aliexpress.com/_EGSkog6
[2025-06-05T14:51:28] Jose: What about this one
[2025-06-05T14:51:32] Dualtron Achilleus: True aha
[2025-06-05T14:52:01] Jose: Thats the idea
[2025-06-05T14:52:07] Jose: I want a definitive scooter
[2025-06-05T14:52:17] Jose: Ive had like 10 diferent scooters
[2025-06-05T14:52:23] Jose: And tried more than 30
[2025-06-05T14:52:47] Jose: And i want one wich destroys everyone ive tried yet
[2025-06-05T14:53:01] Jose: More torke more aut9nomy more speed more everything
[2025-06-05T14:53:14] Yamal: In the end, you decided on Ninebot, that's elegant.
[2025-06-05T14:53:25] Pandalgns: Buy a tesla 😂😂
[2025-06-05T14:54:37] Jose: The idea is not to pay anytipe of tax and electricity or assegurance
[2025-06-05T14:54:41] Jose: 100%

[2025-06-05T14:56:51] Yamal: We are also waiting for 2 admins from this group to finish their g2max.
[2025-06-05T14:57:07] Pandalgns: Naaah
[2025-06-05T14:57:08] Yamal: Single both
[2025-06-05T14:57:19] Pandalgns: A bronco
[2025-06-05T14:57:33] Pandalgns: Like a nami but bigger
[2025-06-05T14:57:51] Yamal: Bronco extreme?
[2025-06-05T14:57:55] Pandalgns: A beast of war armed to annihilate anyone
[2025-06-05T14:58:37] Pandalgns: I love the Bronco, my next chassis in the future will be that one.
[2025-06-05T14:58:49] Jose: Why you want bigger and bigger things
[2025-06-05T14:58:56] Jose: For city use majes no sense
[2025-06-05T14:59:07] Jose: Do you know langfeite?
[2025-06-05T14:59:07] Pandalgns: Big donkey walk or not walk
[2025-06-05T14:59:26] Jose: I live in a bug city
[2025-06-05T15:00:58] Jose: And police are not happy with escooters
[2025-06-05T15:02:52] Pandalgns: Come to asturias 😂😂
[2025-06-05T15:05:47] Pandalgns: I walk around my town quietly as I want and there's no problem, they don't look at the scooters
[2025-06-05T15:10:34] Jose: Come to barcelona lets see how many streets you can run without getting caught
[2025-06-05T15:14:46] skrtt: U just need to be faster than the blue guys. Thats one reason to get vesc :p
[2025-06-05T15:16:48] TrentXWB: Is there a setting to have an acceleration boost at low speed (e.g. 200 phase amps up to 8 km/h and 80 phase amps from 8 to …) ?
[2025-06-05T15:16:52] Jose: Cars okay but if two or more motorbikes are looking for you...
[2025-06-05T15:26:53] Diego: Guys, what front suspension and rear motor do you recommend for the ninebot g2?
[2025-06-05T15:27:27] Jose: Front suspension monorim with exa
[2025-06-05T15:27:42] Jose: What battery and electronics are you going to use
[2025-06-05T15:28:00] Diego: Monorim have shitty screws. I need to find all the new screws
[2025-06-05T15:28:20] Jose: Not dificult to find haha
[2025-06-05T15:28:27] Jose: All M6 i think
[2025-06-05T15:28:32] Diego: Now I just finished doing 16s with original controller. Nice
[2025-06-05T15:29:34] Diego: I'll keep it like this for a while but I want to put 18-20S. It depends on how many cells will fit in the battery compartment. I'll use a vesc
[2025-06-05T15:31:12] Jose: Original controler supports 16s?
[2025-06-05T15:31:34] Diego: With replaced capacitors yes
[2025-06-05T15:35:13] Diego: What engine is this?
[2025-06-05T15:36:13] 'lekrsu': LonnYo 65H 17x4
[2025-06-05T15:38:43] Diego: Can I find it for sale with this code?
[2025-06-05T15:38:49] Jose: Aaah okay
[2025-06-05T15:39:04] Jose: Where are you from?
[2025-06-05T15:40:42] 'lekrsu': You need to contact LonnYo directly to custom order what you want inline with your needs.
[2025-06-05T15:41:26] 'lekrsu': They have a website, whatsapp somewhere. Otherwise order via James.
[2025-06-05T16:01:11] Rose: Hey there Everything is temporary, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-06-05T16:05:37] Yamal: G2max!
[2025-06-05T16:18:23] Pandalgns: Generally, in the maximum torque range, the scooter puts out more amps and once it picks up speed and doesn't have as much torque, the phase amps drop, or so I understand.
[2025-06-05T16:29:49] Yamal: https://youtu.be/Vkv83i_mPF4?si=YckizoraISNFWq1V

[2025-06-05T20:41:39] haku: any trottinette look good on her.
[2025-06-05T20:44:17] Rob Ver: China produce them all so China is the 🥇
[2025-06-05T20:45:37] haku: you are absolutely right. but have faith in western products
[2025-06-05T20:45:57] haku: when china cuts us off we are fucked

[2025-06-05T20:52:56] haku: sad.
[2025-06-05T21:03:08] Smart Repair: Single ?
[2025-06-05T21:06:07] Marius: how much of that is rear?
[2025-06-05T21:06:08] Marius: 25kw?
[2025-06-05T21:10:21] Yamal: Dual for sure………
[2025-06-05T21:12:47] Yamal: This guy has done a beautiful job with the new Ubox! He installed other high-quality FETs with higher voltages and was able to operate safely at 22s, installed inside the scooter's box, with spectacular temperatures and powerful power
[2025-06-05T21:20:01] Smart Repair: Are there any pictures?
[2025-06-05T21:21:52] Marius: i remember he said he only puts really low power on front
[2025-06-05T21:21:57] Marius: so im wondering how much of that is rear power
[2025-06-05T21:22:29] Smart Repair: The rear phase is 420A and the front phase is 120A. Next week I'll try to find space for Express somewhere, then I'll make some good log files
[2025-06-05T21:23:13] Yamal: Yes
[2025-06-05T21:23:26] Yamal: Check on the other Chanel’s

[2025-06-05T21:23:54] Yamal: Your g2 monster when
[2025-06-05T21:24:01] Yamal: 😣
[2025-06-05T21:26:38] Smart Repair: Yes... unfortunately, the pins for an external card reader aren't accessible either. This would require removing the ESP from the board.
[2025-06-05T21:27:02] haku: i barely workout arms @jamaludin_algarnati but the reason for the season is here. the suns out guns out is here. need that horseshoe triceps yamal

[2025-06-05T22:06:26] Rob Ver: But it would be nice if deck is at least 210mm wide and more than 400mm long. I have a battery from my last year build

[2025-06-05T22:21:43] Smart Repair: <photos/photo_23800@05-06-2025_22-21-43.jpg>
[2025-06-05T22:26:22] Noname: Idk if it's just the controller. Bring it home and Vesc it lol

[2025-06-05T22:34:32] Smart Repair: Germany
[2025-06-05T22:35:02] Rob Ver: So nich so weit))

[2025-06-05T22:36:11] Rob Ver: Abber ich probiere es
[2025-06-05T22:36:25] Smart Repair: Dropout 125mm. For larger engines, the swingarm must be extensively redesigned.
[2025-06-05T22:37:07] Rob Ver: 60h is more than enugh
[2025-06-05T22:37:14] Smart Repair: hehe.. but you can write English. Others speaking English are not welcome here

[2025-06-05T22:37:34] haku: unlike segway chat
[2025-06-05T22:37:51] Rob Ver: OK ok kein problem
[2025-06-05T22:37:54] Rob Ver: 😆
[2025-06-05T22:38:08] Smart Repair: 60h for a 65kg scooter? I think that's a bit too small
[2025-06-05T22:38:30] Rob Ver: 60H magnets
[2025-06-05T22:39:03] Smart Repair: I use translation because my English is shit 😅
[2025-06-05T22:39:10] Rob Ver: I use them on frend modded dualtron and till 80kmh he is werry fast
[2025-06-05T22:39:16] Noname: I don't pay for them and I use it as a hammer
[2025-06-05T22:39:49] Rob Ver: How much for the frame
[2025-06-05T22:43:07] Jose: Spain
[2025-06-05T22:43:18] Jose: You dont have dgt in italy?
[2025-06-05T22:44:15] luffydnoob: Guys mixing 2 controllers with different amps would that affect anything. thunder 2 45a front controller and thunder 2 60a rear. Someone told me one would block the other because of different speeds they go
[2025-06-05T22:47:18] Jose: They will go same speed but less power
[2025-06-05T22:47:43] Jose: Speed depends on voltage, not on amps
[2025-06-05T22:48:01] Jose: But why would you do that?
[2025-06-05T22:49:37] haku: @skrt15 @jamaludin_algarnati michelin star workouts only.
[2025-06-05T22:49:38] luffydnoob: There is no other option I can't find a 45a controller that matches the other. On the other hand 60a version is there on AliExpress and second hand too
[2025-06-05T22:49:39] Jose: How did you adapt the lonnyo motor to the g2max?
[2025-06-05T22:49:46] Jose: From your profile photos
[2025-06-05T22:50:21] luffydnoob: I bought one for 85 euros second hand so it wasn't that expensive
[2025-06-05T22:50:21] Jose: <photos/photo_23802@05-06-2025_22-50-21.jpg>
[2025-06-05T22:50:40] Jose: Which controllers are you using?
[2025-06-05T22:51:42] Noname: It's fine just put smaller in front. I've turned my front down to keep from spinning the tire
[2025-06-05T22:53:45] luffydnoob: Before thunder 2 controllers 45a amp each
[2025-06-05T22:54:03] luffydnoob: Now would be 60a rear and 45a front
[2025-06-05T22:54:08] Noname: Oh at what power?
[2025-06-05T22:54:48] luffydnoob: All of them are thunder 2 controllers
[2025-06-05T22:55:03] luffydnoob: Only difference is the amp
[2025-06-05T22:56:29] Jose: Just make some shunt on the 45A controller and you have it
[2025-06-05T22:57:08] Jose: Are you intersted on a janobike t85?
[2025-06-05T22:57:10] luffydnoob: I don't wanna mess around with something I don't know well 😅
[2025-06-05T22:57:26] Jose: 😔
[2025-06-05T22:57:29] Jose: Makes sense
[2025-06-05T22:57:49] Jose: Its not difficult
[2025-06-05T22:58:12] Jose: Just a little conection and you have it
[2025-06-05T22:58:22] Noname: What's the problem?
[2025-06-05T22:58:46] Jose: If you send some images i can tell you what to do
[2025-06-05T22:59:08] Jose: You just need to know how to use a welder
[2025-06-05T23:00:02] Rob Ver: 100A and 220A phase
[2025-06-05T23:01:55] Rob Ver: I prefer the nami burn this frame is big enugh for battery i have
[2025-06-05T23:02:02] luffydnoob: Ok as soon I receive the other one, I install and see how it works. If everything is fine I keep it like that. if not I try to send you a picture thanks buddy 👌👌👌

[2025-06-05T23:05:31] skrtt: https://youtu.be/aurfJ4miHT0?si=DqH755PfRSjx40nj
[2025-06-05T23:06:03] skrtt: Keep in mind that when u go down the chest dont touch the ground. U need to do plank
[2025-06-05T23:06:47] skrtt: Get a thunder
[2025-06-05T23:06:54] skrtt: I think u have space
[2025-06-05T23:08:15] haku: the michelin star way is to curl for the girls
[2025-06-05T23:08:32] haku: suns out guns out
[2025-06-05T23:10:28] haku: we only do non functional workouts here. only for aesthetics thats the michelin star way
[2025-06-05T23:16:11] Smart Repair: I'm not sure yet if I'll finish the second GT... if not, I'll get back to you
[2025-06-05T23:17:25] Smart Repair: The g2 is easy... just turn two bolts and two sleeves. It's pretty self-explanatory. And a 3D-printed mudguard mount to properly reattach it.
[2025-06-06T00:14:43] Yamal: <video_file>
[2025-06-06T00:54:32] Yamal: Nice !

[2025-06-06T03:08:38] Noname: You putting baby powder on the tube?
[2025-06-06T03:09:15] Noname: Ulip tubes baby powder and no burnouts is the answer
[2025-06-06T03:13:06] haku: no burnouts is ilegal in my city
[2025-06-06T03:14:27] haku: tubeless or go home
[2025-06-06T03:15:12] Noname: I've had 3 flats in like 4 years. Glass nail and wood.
[2025-06-06T03:15:53] Noname: But can't argue tubeless is prob better
[2025-06-06T03:25:36] haku: i did not get a flat due to nails. my airpump siked uno me. instead of adding air it took air out
[2025-06-06T03:26:00] haku: i had to go to gas station pay the dollar fitty
[2025-06-06T03:26:16] Noname: Oh thought you got a flat again.
[2025-06-06T03:26:24] Noname: Manual pump always works bud
[2025-06-06T03:30:54] haku: electric pump. need another
[2025-06-06T03:31:41] haku: its hard to bead tubeless with straps on manual pump i bet
[2025-06-06T04:07:43] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Depends on rim and tire
[2025-06-06T04:07:52] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: G30 with chaoyand is pain in ass
[2025-06-06T04:08:06] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: some sharing "bolt" motor with ulip tire is perfect
[2025-06-06T04:17:39] skrtt: Pay to get air?????
[2025-06-06T04:27:09] haku: ya. michelin star always pays

[2025-06-06T04:31:17] haku: thats a delicacy here. cheaper to buy fast food
[2025-06-06T04:31:46] skrtt: 3:30am eating papaya 😗
[2025-06-06T04:31:59] haku: fancy
[2025-06-06T04:32:05] skrtt: That burguer looks good ngl
[2025-06-06T04:32:10] haku: papaya is imported fruit here
[2025-06-06T04:34:12] skrtt: Here too
[2025-06-06T04:36:20] haku: it only grows in tropocal climates. as you can see only michelin stars would know that
[2025-06-06T04:38:58] Matthew: Have you ever had the pleasure of eating green papaya Thai salad?
[2025-06-06T04:39:22] haku: nope. i dont eat veggies unfortunately
[2025-06-06T04:39:49] haku: only when on a calorie deficit diet
[2025-06-06T04:47:07] Matthew: Gotcha. Its different. I like it when they make it with big ol sweet shrimp 🤤🤤🤤
[2025-06-06T04:48:05] Matthew: It is rare to find and generally pretty expensive. Pretty good authentic Thai restaurants will have it usually.
[2025-06-06T04:56:54] skrtt: Why not?
[2025-06-06T06:01:00] haku: because im not vegan
[2025-06-06T06:01:58] haku: im reverse vegan actually. i think murduring plants is bad for carbon footprint

[2025-06-06T07:16:19] Rob Ver: I don't need it for high speed
[2025-06-06T07:16:23] haku: yea
[2025-06-06T07:16:53] Yamal: 80h 17/4 on it
[2025-06-06T07:16:57] haku: i didnt realized g30 is as long as vsetts until i got one
[2025-06-06T07:17:04] Yamal: 1000A phase / 600A battery
[2025-06-06T07:17:45] Rob Ver: I think they can't hold so much amps tho
[2025-06-06T07:18:03] Yamal: I mean dual 80h xD
[2025-06-06T07:18:14] haku: not 17/4 i wonder what saturation on those
[2025-06-06T07:18:57] Rob Ver: Guys if someone put us all in one place we will make a 🚀
[2025-06-06T07:19:02] haku: dual 80h 17x4 would be badass for burnouts
[2025-06-06T07:19:43] Yamal: True
[2025-06-06T07:20:04] Yamal: No need Willy wonky,! Now we have ubox custom performance xD
[2025-06-06T07:20:54] haku: i have 3 12 fet powerstage to experiment new fets on. but i dont have logics
[2025-06-06T07:21:14] Rob Ver: Aaaa nicee
[2025-06-06T07:21:15] haku: too bad they stopped making the old version
[2025-06-06T07:21:39] Rob Ver: Haku tolt one
[2025-06-06T07:21:54] haku: tolt on alu boards haha
[2025-06-06T07:22:15] Yamal: If someone asks you what Willy Wonky is, it's just this :

[2025-06-06T07:44:08] Rob Ver: I need compact small size controllers
[2025-06-06T07:44:44] Rob Ver: But if we could add 6 fets per phase shuld be crazy
[2025-06-06T07:45:22] Rob Ver: Total 18
[2025-06-06T07:46:03] Rob Ver: And thicker copper bus drives or how are they called
[2025-06-06T07:50:03] Yamal: Bus drives XD

[2025-06-06T08:08:28] Yamal: Really?
[2025-06-06T08:08:51] haku: yea. his zero 11bbuild rolling burnouts inspired me
[2025-06-06T08:09:06] Rob Ver: <photos/photo_23805@06-06-2025_08-09-06.jpg>
[2025-06-06T08:09:14] Yamal: Never know
[2025-06-06T08:09:22] Rob Ver: Those places
[2025-06-06T08:09:26] Yamal: You long time here right

[2025-06-06T08:11:02] Yamal: vesc soldiers
[2025-06-06T08:11:40] Rob Ver: And harder to replace them 😆
[2025-06-06T08:12:10] Rob Ver: <photos/photo_23806@06-06-2025_08-12-10.jpg>
[2025-06-06T08:12:19] Rob Ver: Here are tolt fets
[2025-06-06T08:13:00] Rob Ver: But now we need allso bigger caps
[2025-06-06T08:13:04] haku: phd in cad. batchelor engineer in batteries. peak g30v2 pilot training for g forces, phd in swole and projects, and many more achievements
[2025-06-06T08:13:19] Rob Ver: And it's probably 22s max
[2025-06-06T08:13:32] haku: i cannot list it all. too many
[2025-06-06T08:13:42] Yamal: Hey man
[2025-06-06T08:13:56] Yamal: What you wanna do with your 70h ?
[2025-06-06T08:14:00] Rob Ver: But it's quite hard to do
[2025-06-06T08:14:22] Yamal: Wepoor 👍👎
[2025-06-06T08:14:23] haku: i will get wepoor working soon and see if it gets confiscated
[2025-06-06T08:14:26] Yamal: ?
[2025-06-06T08:14:37] Rob Ver: And after you need microscope to check all legs of the MOSFET'S
[2025-06-06T08:14:43] Yamal: Good election man
[2025-06-06T08:14:51] Yamal: Is nice and powerfully
[2025-06-06T08:15:16] haku: 33x2 70h on a peak g30 frame sounds ubsurd. but you never know what inspires me
[2025-06-06T08:16:23] Yamal: You need torque motor
[2025-06-06T08:16:30] Yamal: Talk with Amy
[2025-06-06T08:16:35] haku: yea
[2025-06-06T08:16:57] haku: big titty amy is my only hope now
[2025-06-06T08:18:00] Rob Ver: And I put original MOSFET'S to the 100v 100A x2
[2025-06-06T08:18:16] Rob Ver: To replace those shitty one
[2025-06-06T08:18:21] haku: i think 20s 4 or 5p 50pl can run those motors
[2025-06-06T08:18:35] haku: on 11 tire
[2025-06-06T08:18:56] Rob Ver: <photos/photo_23807@06-06-2025_08-18-56.jpg>
[2025-06-06T08:19:13] haku: i want 17x4 or 22x3 though
[2025-06-06T08:20:50] haku: we shall see.
[2025-06-06T08:23:02] Rob Ver: I will report how it will hold. This is controller from my frend. His original mosfet did die quite fast. And he has not even high power on them. About 60A per controller and 120A phase. With good cooling
[2025-06-06T08:25:30] haku: where tolt?
[2025-06-06T08:30:16] Yamal: Nice work
[2025-06-06T08:32:20] Rob Ver: You are looking at them
[2025-06-06T08:32:48] Rob Ver: All 12 of them
[2025-06-06T08:45:39] Rob Ver: Guys what max battery Amps did you load to the 80H 22x3
[2025-06-06T08:48:49] haku: where. looks like regular fets
[2025-06-06T08:49:18] haku: toll
[2025-06-06T08:58:14] Yamal: Maybe tolt but not Infineon tolt
[2025-06-06T08:58:18] Yamal: ?
[2025-06-06T08:58:23] Yamal: I really don’t know
[2025-06-06T09:08:10] Hackintoshhhh: Bro that’s PG-HSOF-8
[2025-06-06T09:08:13] Hackintoshhhh: TOLL
[2025-06-06T09:08:20] Hackintoshhhh: This aint TOLT lmao
[2025-06-06T09:09:11] Hackintoshhhh: TOLL-8L/PG-HSOF-8 def not TOLT
[2025-06-06T09:10:08] Yamal: Ok thank you ^^’
[2025-06-06T09:10:52] Yamal: This type of fet
[2025-06-06T09:11:18] Yamal: Same power than tolt ?
[2025-06-06T09:13:55] Marius: Nahhhh
[2025-06-06T09:16:27] Hackintoshhhh: Tolt way better for cooling
[2025-06-06T09:16:41] Hackintoshhhh: I didn’t go much into high amp tolt as i don’t have a x12
[2025-06-06T09:16:48] Hackintoshhhh: This might change soon tho
[2025-06-06T09:17:09] Hackintoshhhh: Im thinking jasons esc rear and x12 front then i can do 20-25mm spacer only
[2025-06-06T09:17:28] Hackintoshhhh: I push 480a phase per 85250
[2025-06-06T09:17:33] Hackintoshhhh: No issue so far
[2025-06-06T09:17:38] Yamal: Crazy.. hehe
[2025-06-06T09:17:45] Hackintoshhhh: But modded
[2025-06-06T09:17:48] Hackintoshhhh: MOT1111T
[2025-06-06T09:17:52] Hackintoshhhh: Cool and powerful
[2025-06-06T09:17:56] Yamal: I know

[2025-06-06T09:18:38] Hackintoshhhh: My friend daily activity
[2025-06-06T09:19:07] Yamal: traveling around your country on a lime scooter?
[2025-06-06T09:19:31] Hackintoshhhh: Well that’d my weekend activity
[2025-06-06T09:19:42] Hackintoshhhh: During the week it’s at home enjoying the peace
[2025-06-06T09:19:58] Hackintoshhhh: On weekend mosfets get ass whoopin

[2025-06-06T09:21:41] Marius: I need a miracle rn from nkon
[2025-06-06T09:21:48] Hackintoshhhh: Wdym
[2025-06-06T09:21:58] Marius: Does someone know how they transport cells from China to EU
[2025-06-06T09:22:07] Hackintoshhhh: Just like vapcell
[2025-06-06T09:22:11] Hackintoshhhh: DHL Express
[2025-06-06T09:22:17] Hackintoshhhh: By air
[2025-06-06T09:22:19] Marius: The preorder is for 10th of July 😂😂
[2025-06-06T09:22:29] Hackintoshhhh: What cell do u need
[2025-06-06T09:22:34] Marius: Then why does it take a Month
[2025-06-06T09:22:45] Marius: I ordered them already 40pl
[2025-06-06T09:23:12] Hackintoshhhh: Well they go directly from factory, maybe they don’t have stock? And restocking at nkon also takes time
[2025-06-06T09:23:56] Marius: I thought when preorder is possible it means its already on its way to nkon
[2025-06-06T09:24:18] Marius: Maybe itll be quicker tho is what im hoping for
[2025-06-06T09:24:30] Marius: 10th of July is madness
[2025-06-06T09:24:39] Hackintoshhhh: Never
[2025-06-06T09:24:49] Hackintoshhhh: I had preorder 50E for a friend

[2025-06-06T09:25:11] Marius: Ok im cooked
[2025-06-06T09:25:41] Hackintoshhhh: Vapcell is like 70€ more expensive BUT shipping is insane
[2025-06-06T09:25:44] Hackintoshhhh: And cells are cheaper
[2025-06-06T09:25:49] Hackintoshhhh: But shipping more expensive
[2025-06-06T09:25:54] Marius: And theres not much i can do without cells
[2025-06-06T09:25:56] Hackintoshhhh: Get em from vapcell next tome
[2025-06-06T09:26:05] Hackintoshhhh: They alr proved they legit
[2025-06-06T09:26:29] Hackintoshhhh: Dubai daniel ordered 10s of thousands of cells from them and i got 130 legit 50PL‘s
[2025-06-06T09:26:35] Hackintoshhhh: So
[2025-06-06T09:26:59] Marius: Nah im only in a rush rn cuz peak Weather is coming soon

[2025-06-06T09:28:26] Marius: I got everything just need cells
[2025-06-06T09:28:44] Dualtron Achilleus: What mean peak g30 lul
[2025-06-06T09:28:52] Dualtron Achilleus: I only know g30
[2025-06-06T09:29:10] Hackintoshhhh: Oh nice. 33x2 you will fall in love
[2025-06-06T09:29:32] Hackintoshhhh: You want but motors dont xd
[2025-06-06T09:29:42] Hackintoshhhh: 30kmh cruise they heat so fkn much
[2025-06-06T09:30:07] Marius: Didnt u say temps are fine
[2025-06-06T09:30:19] Hackintoshhhh: Temps are fine over 60 cruise
[2025-06-06T09:30:34] Marius: Ah good then
[2025-06-06T09:30:38] Hackintoshhhh: But 30kmh they struggle a bit heat wise.
[2025-06-06T09:31:01] Marius: Gota be careful since i only know the xiaomi
[2025-06-06T09:31:16] Hackintoshhhh: 27-33 when going up a hill heat but more than 50 uphill no heat

[2025-06-06T09:32:11] Marius: I dont wanna end up like all These ppl that crashed after 1 week
[2025-06-06T09:34:16] Hackintoshhhh: Yeah, tbh just don’t be stupid
[2025-06-06T09:34:26] Hackintoshhhh: Ppl that crash overestimate themselves
[2025-06-06T09:34:31] Marius: I can Control myself
[2025-06-06T09:34:48] Hackintoshhhh: I can but barely
[2025-06-06T09:35:49] Marius: With more driving experience u can push it more
[2025-06-06T09:36:06] Marius: Doesnt Roger have like 30k km on his g30
[2025-06-06T09:36:21] Hackintoshhhh: Idk he has no scooter as of now tho

[2025-06-06T09:36:49] Hackintoshhhh: 97kmh comfortably
[2025-06-06T09:37:02] Marius: I imagine that doesnt help u with awd
[2025-06-06T09:37:09] Hackintoshhhh: Yeah true
[2025-06-06T09:37:10] Marius: Fwd so much slower
[2025-06-06T09:37:29] Hackintoshhhh: Well, after 30+ handling pretty much same
[2025-06-06T09:37:45] Hackintoshhhh: But getting it up to 30 is hard and awd has fuckeria tork
[2025-06-06T09:38:19] Marius: Yeah Accel must be way different
[2025-06-06T09:39:37] Hackintoshhhh: dont drive it when u need to poop
[2025-06-06T09:39:50] Hackintoshhhh: it will push the shit out ur ass on accel
[2025-06-06T09:42:35] Marius: Are the 40pl from them same grade as nkon?

[2025-06-06T09:44:04] Marius: Thats cheaper bruh
[2025-06-06T09:44:25] Rob Ver: Becouse they looks the same on outside
[2025-06-06T09:45:30] Hackintoshhhh: drop model number or never happened
[2025-06-06T09:45:52] Hackintoshhhh: there are none infineon 120v 331a toll fets out there
[2025-06-06T09:45:59] Marius: How long does it take

[2025-06-06T09:59:41] Hackintoshhhh: as a company its much easier to do taxes if you have documents from nkon
[2025-06-06T09:59:51] Marius: So its more than the 2.2 and 150 shipping?
[2025-06-06T10:00:04] Hackintoshhhh: probably import tax on top

[2025-06-06T10:01:27] Marius: Hmmm
[2025-06-06T10:02:07] Marius: They Tell u before what u have to pay? Or do the Customs randomly come after ordering
[2025-06-06T10:02:39] Hackintoshhhh: customs can be calculated accurately with chatgpt, need to pay at ur door tho

[2025-06-06T10:05:27] Marius: So how do the cells differ?
[2025-06-06T10:06:27] Hackintoshhhh: they dont, only manufacture date

[2025-06-06T22:55:57] haku: <sticker>
[2025-06-06T22:57:09] Smart Repair: sure? not BT?
[2025-06-06T22:57:45] Pandalgns: Oh, sorry, yes, it's true, I was confused 😅😅 sorry
[2025-06-06T22:58:24] Pandalgns: I'm doing other things and I didn't focus on what you asked, sorry, I think I burned a controller and I'm thinking about it.
[2025-06-06T23:00:15] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_23826@06-06-2025_23-00-15.jpg>
[2025-06-06T23:00:32] Pandalgns: I'm a little screwed 😅😅
[2025-06-06T23:00:48] Pandalgns: <video_file>
[2025-06-06T23:03:05] Pandalgns: At times it accelerates a little from the PC and at times not even that, but whether I accelerate from the PC or move the wheel, when it reaches 5 km/h everything goes to shit. I have to say that before I plugged in the battery a little smoke came out more or less around the LED area.
[2025-06-06T23:05:08] Pandalgns: I'm getting a little fed up with vesc, lately I see a lot of burns, including mine... they are too delicate, more than it seems.... 🤦‍♂🤦‍♂
[2025-06-06T23:45:04] Yamal: Uy yuy yuyiiiiiiiiiiiiii
[2025-06-06T23:45:14] Yamal: 😁
[2025-06-06T23:50:32] Pandalgns: I see this motherfucker burned
[2025-06-06T23:51:37] Pandalgns: Could the problem be coming from there? The smoke came out more or less from that area, although it seems to be a component of the can and the communication between controllers is detected by the vesc program.
[2025-06-06T23:55:17] Yamal: Broken controller
[2025-06-06T23:55:20] Yamal: ?
[2025-06-07T00:00:56] Pandalgns: It's failing, but I don't know why, some microcomponent that said enough
[2025-06-07T00:06:48] Pandalgns: I'll try to remove that component from the one I had burned and put it on this one... wish me luck
[2025-06-07T00:13:54] skrtt: 😔
[2025-06-07T00:14:54] skrtt: Im a little heavy so this means i need to be carefull not to burn them?
[2025-06-07T00:15:58] Yamal: Let's hope it can be fixed!
[2025-06-07T00:16:17] Gt Pro Karl: When is to much to much?

[2025-06-07T00:18:28] haku: what is kelly? fossils?
[2025-06-07T00:18:32] Yamal: Just talk about Kelly VS Vesc

[2025-06-07T00:32:30] Gt Pro Karl: This freewheel spin. And I'm messing with the field weakening settings dunno how high up I should go
[2025-06-07T00:32:32] Gt Pro Karl: Safely
[2025-06-07T00:32:48] haku: open source is michelin stars
[2025-06-07T00:32:52] Gt Pro Karl: Currently fw each motor is 55a
[2025-06-07T00:33:04] Gt Pro Karl: And the current is 210 amp each motor
[2025-06-07T00:33:13] Gt Pro Karl: Battery current 50amp each side
[2025-06-07T00:33:52] Gt Pro Karl: It was making at 77 mph freewheel
[2025-06-07T00:33:57] haku: one day i will be able to contribute to the community. haku observer. use it only for burnouts
[2025-06-07T00:34:02] Gt Pro Karl: Rw conditions hit 66mph
[2025-06-07T00:34:03] skrtt: But more weight=more probability to burn at the same settings
[2025-06-07T00:34:19] Gt Pro Karl: 72v battery dual 100amp output
[2025-06-07T00:34:39] Gt Pro Karl: Dual ubox 150 with custom fw for 250amp
[2025-06-07T00:34:52] Gt Pro Karl: 85v 150amp uboxes
[2025-06-07T00:35:05] Gt Pro Karl: Motors are hard to say
[2025-06-07T00:35:27] Gt Pro Karl: Both 2000w kaabo wolf king gt pro motors

[2025-06-07T00:36:30] Gt Pro Karl: I can push 200 amps normally with no issues
[2025-06-07T00:36:40] Gt Pro Karl: Max temp had been 55 Celsius
[2025-06-07T00:36:55] Gt Pro Karl: That's what I've been running with zero field weakening
[2025-06-07T00:37:04] Gt Pro Karl: But I need more from her atp
[2025-06-07T00:37:21] Gt Pro Karl: I just can't figure out how much field weakening amps is to much
[2025-06-07T00:42:58] Gt Pro Karl: No it's set at 210 amps each right now
[2025-06-07T00:43:08] Gt Pro Karl: With 55a field weakening
[2025-06-07T00:43:24] Gt Pro Karl: Now it may not be hitting that as you allude
[2025-06-07T00:43:37] Gt Pro Karl: But it's not set at 200amps currently
[2025-06-07T00:43:42] Gt Pro Karl: ..
[2025-06-07T00:44:35] Gt Pro Karl: So what will happen running it like u say if it's 50a battery can't support 200a?
[2025-06-07T00:44:42] Gt Pro Karl: Will slow me down while riding?
[2025-06-07T00:46:04] Gt Pro Karl: Also if I should clarify I'm not expecting to hit 90 mph I just want more torque and speed out of the setup
[2025-06-07T00:46:14] Gt Pro Karl: The motors can handle power for sure

[2025-06-07T01:03:11] 'lekrsu': Faster reduction of phase as phase voltage increases (speed, if you want to call it so)
[2025-06-07T01:03:11] Gt Pro Karl: It's peaking at almost 400amps total
[2025-06-07T01:04:02] 'lekrsu': Approximately: 50A batt at full speed = 50A phase.
[2025-06-07T01:04:17] Gt Pro Karl: So increasing battery amps will keep me from losing speed faster
[2025-06-07T01:05:28] 'lekrsu': You see on the RT screen during riding, beginning at 200A with a very quick reduction down until it eventually hits 50A. You're adding field weakening so it won't be exactly this now.
[2025-06-07T01:06:26] 'lekrsu': Phase current is your acceleration power.
[2025-06-07T01:06:41] 'lekrsu': Does it make sense?
[2025-06-07T01:07:05] Gt Pro Karl: Yes but the field weakening is making me faster?
[2025-06-07T01:07:10] Gt Pro Karl: As well?
[2025-06-07T01:07:17] 'lekrsu': Don't confuse speed with acceleration.
[2025-06-07T01:07:37] Gt Pro Karl: Ahhh
[2025-06-07T01:08:06] Gt Pro Karl: So 210 amps is faster acceleration
[2025-06-07T01:08:15] Gt Pro Karl: Battery and field weakening affect speed
[2025-06-07T01:08:42] 'lekrsu': You can be speed limited by battery amps not being able to generate the power you need.
[2025-06-07T01:09:15] 'lekrsu': Increasing battery current will increase your phase current between the span of standstill and top speed, to be higher at any speed.
[2025-06-07T01:09:53] Gt Pro Karl: No we are getting somewhere! Thankyou so much guys!
[2025-06-07T01:11:34] 'lekrsu': <photos/photo_23835@07-06-2025_01-11-34.jpg>
[2025-06-07T01:11:47] 'lekrsu': Not to scale ^^
[2025-06-07T01:12:17] 'lekrsu': Phase current will always bottom out at battery current limit eventually.
[2025-06-07T01:12:24] Gt Pro Karl: <photos/photo_23836@07-06-2025_01-12-24.jpg>
[2025-06-07T01:12:34] Gt Pro Karl: Increasing battery amps giving me lower speed
[2025-06-07T01:12:54] Gt Pro Karl: But that means will sustain higher speeds longer if I understand correctly
[2025-06-07T01:13:01] 'lekrsu': No?
[2025-06-07T01:13:58] Matthew: Voltage is what gives you rpm(speed) amps help push you forward(torque)
[2025-06-07T01:16:08] Gt Pro Karl: If useless why am I getting like a 20mph increase with it?
[2025-06-07T01:16:21] Gt Pro Karl: Is that false?
[2025-06-07T01:16:40] Gt Pro Karl: Ahhhh ok
[2025-06-07T01:16:41] 'lekrsu': It's true but it's a useless metric specifically in the air.
[2025-06-07T01:17:00] 'lekrsu': Easiest way to kill a controller, field weakening in air.
[2025-06-07T01:17:40] Pandalgns: Guys, after testing the controller several times, I've noticed that it seems that the power is not reaching the control part properly, that is, the board where the connectors and the microchip are, etc. Could it be that the voltage controller in that area has burned out?
[2025-06-07T01:17:40] Gt Pro Karl: I had no clue
[2025-06-07T01:18:26] Gt Pro Karl: That's insane
[2025-06-07T01:19:03] 'lekrsu': Touch the phases during this, I dare you
[2025-06-07T01:19:20] Gt Pro Karl: Ive had this thing up to 70 on the interstate. That's going off displayed speed not GPS. My max is usually 65 any faster is scary asf I'm not gl
[2025-06-07T01:19:40] Gt Pro Karl: But I've had issues for awhile now
[2025-06-07T01:19:48] Gt Pro Karl: Due to hall sensor cables and phase etc
[2025-06-07T01:20:00] Gt Pro Karl: Needing reglued etc
[2025-06-07T01:20:05] Pandalgns: I have seen that in the error list I have sometimes seen a low voltage error or something like that.
[2025-06-07T01:20:14] Gt Pro Karl: Now I'm trying push as hard as I can without burning stuff up
[2025-06-07T01:21:07] Pandalgns: 2 or 3 times under voltage error but not always
[2025-06-07T01:21:40] Gt Pro Karl: Try ratchet strap?
[2025-06-07T01:21:48] 'lekrsu': Long ago ^^
[2025-06-07T01:22:29] 'lekrsu': Surprised the observer could handle it, which ESC was it?
[2025-06-07T01:22:52] Gt Pro Karl: <photos/photo_23837@07-06-2025_01-22-52.jpg>
[2025-06-07T01:23:03] Pandalgns: It turns on but there are times when the LED lights up very weakly and flashes as if it is not receiving the power properly and when I have it connected to the PC it detects it and suddenly stops detecting it and detects it again as if it turns on and off because it is not receiving the power properly.
[2025-06-07T01:23:05] Gt Pro Karl: The scooter in question
[2025-06-07T01:23:22] Gt Pro Karl: See that's why I'm asking u guys what max i can go with it is
[2025-06-07T01:24:46] Pandalgns: But it started to fail me today while driving, it would turn on or not, or it would turn on and suddenly turn off and fail
[2025-06-07T01:25:15] Pandalgns: Could it be the voltage regulator on the logic part?
[2025-06-07T01:26:51] Pandalgns: I don't feel anything getting hot, what did happen is that one of the resistors under the CAN connector burned out even though I already changed it. I think it was one of the resistors in the CAN's security system.
[2025-06-07T01:27:33] Pandalgns: This
[2025-06-07T01:28:00] Pandalgns: But I already changed it and the can seems to work fine.
[2025-06-07T01:28:31] Gt Pro Karl: Tysm
[2025-06-07T01:28:41] Gt Pro Karl: I'll probably aim to lower it a bit then
[2025-06-07T01:29:44] Pandalgns: Yes, apart from one of the symptoms is that if it lets me accelerate, when it goes over 5 or 10 km/h it turns off and when it doesn't let me accelerate if I move the wheel with my hand it also turns off
[2025-06-07T01:31:22] Pandalgns: But it also happens to me without having it connected to the PC.
[2025-06-07T01:32:27] Pandalgns: The failure started today when I went out to test it.
[2025-06-07T01:33:40] Pandalgns: .
[2025-06-07T01:34:03] Pandalgns: And this is the error log
[2025-06-07T01:34:46] Pandalgns: On/Off mod for adapting the QSS4 display
[2025-06-07T01:34:58] Pandalgns: It has been working perfectly since I installed it.
[2025-06-07T01:36:04] Pandalgns: With the DC DC switch??
[2025-06-07T01:37:06] haku: thats luxury right there. michelin stars, forbes 5 star
[2025-06-07T01:37:41] Pandalgns: Likewise, the last tests I did were without the display connected, directly to the battery, the motor and nothing else, accelerating from the keyboard as if there was no display mod connected and it fails the same.
[2025-06-07T01:37:50] Gt Pro Karl: Got 2 100amp batteries so I'll up each controller to 70-80 amps and lower phase as u said see how it goes.
[2025-06-07T01:38:21] Gt Pro Karl: Hey thanks! All thanks to tanakorn wila in thailand!
[2025-06-07T01:39:20] Gt Pro Karl: Definitely one of the most durable gt pros available. More durable than stock for damn sure!
[2025-06-07T01:40:04] Gt Pro Karl: I put steel rods on both sides instead of the original aluminum bar that ran on sides and she can handle up to 400 pounds atp
[2025-06-07T01:40:32] Gt Pro Karl: Ive put a 270 pound rider before
[2025-06-07T01:40:46] Gt Pro Karl: Im only 160 totaled weight of scooter 180 pounds
[2025-06-07T01:41:04] haku: crazy. all battery inside that box?
[2025-06-07T01:41:10] Gt Pro Karl: Sure is
[2025-06-07T01:41:14] Pandalgns: @jamessoderstrom I'm going to sleep now since I have to work tomorrow and I wake up in a little over 4 hours. If I talk to you privately tomorrow, would you mind helping me with this problem?
[2025-06-07T01:41:15] haku: good stuff
[2025-06-07T01:41:18] Gt Pro Karl: Got enough space for the charger
[2025-06-07T01:41:20] Gt Pro Karl: That's it
[2025-06-07T01:41:24] Gt Pro Karl: And light controllers
[2025-06-07T02:34:48] haku: no inferior light bar mount designed in my office Noname. thats why im president and ceo of HIW.
[2025-06-07T03:12:18] Noname: Bitch please I'll clean out my desk. Open a bodega I don't need this job
[2025-06-07T03:12:51] haku: no dont leave HIW. you will be promoted soon
[2025-06-07T03:13:12] haku: no he needs me. i dont need him

[2025-06-07T03:17:03] Noname: Idk what I gotta put magnets or steel in it to stay put lol
[2025-06-07T03:17:12] haku: told you to just weld and make it out of steel. plastic inferior
[2025-06-07T03:17:18] haku: not bulletproof
[2025-06-07T03:55:17] Face de Pin Sucé: Never listen to what say this guy 😂
[2025-06-07T04:00:14] haku: i never listen to non michelin stars.
[2025-06-07T04:02:46] skrtt: Some with kelly
[2025-06-07T04:19:56] skrtt: So its ok to be fat?
[2025-06-07T04:20:10] skrtt: Or do i need to keep the power down?
[2025-06-07T04:25:25] haku: dont fat shame boy. some michelin star chefs are fat because they are michelin stars
[2025-06-07T04:25:35] skrtt: Im am fat
[2025-06-07T04:25:54] haku: identify as fat or fat fat?
[2025-06-07T04:26:02] skrtt: But i lost 4kgs in 1.5 month
[2025-06-07T04:26:08] skrtt: Im fat fat
[2025-06-07T04:26:13] skrtt: So thats a start
[2025-06-07T04:26:15] haku: same
[2025-06-07T04:26:24] haku: rock the fat bod
[2025-06-07T04:26:32] skrtt: I think some were water retencion
[2025-06-07T04:26:56] skrtt: No. It started to be unhealthy
[2025-06-07T04:27:04] skrtt: 115 is no joke
[2025-06-07T04:27:09] haku: thats normal. you might have thyroid issues or too much salt
[2025-06-07T04:27:25] haku: 115 is average american
[2025-06-07T04:27:31] skrtt: 250 pound for burguer land
[2025-06-07T04:27:35] skrtt: 😌
[2025-06-07T04:27:51] Noname: That's not bad nearing 300 is
[2025-06-07T04:28:02] skrtt: That is bad bro
[2025-06-07T04:28:20] skrtt: For EU “standarts”
[2025-06-07T04:28:21] Noname: The 130lb stick man at work makes comments to me im 185
[2025-06-07T04:28:35] haku: thats good news imo. look at it in a positive way. you can vesc an electric wheelchair and you get disabled parking
[2025-06-07T04:28:53] Noname: Our office guy is like 350+
[2025-06-07T04:29:12] haku: thats america boy land of the free
[2025-06-07T04:29:48] haku: your 185lbs?
[2025-06-07T04:30:04] skrtt: My mechanic is making a electric wheel chair for a friend. Im trying to convince him to vesc it but his friend budget is not that high so its a no
[2025-06-07T04:30:26] haku: i saw a fancy one. but they want too much for it
[2025-06-07T04:30:30] skrtt: Cuz he needs sum power to get it up on a ramp
[2025-06-07T04:30:32] haku: it has a joystick

[2025-06-07T10:46:48] Pandalgns: I'll try today to see if Master James can help me, but I have my suspicions that it's the voltage module of the logic part that's failing.
[2025-06-07T10:46:58] Yamal: But always is 💸
[2025-06-07T10:47:08] Yamal: Cant for the moment

[2025-06-07T17:23:38] Izuna 生活: I will modify this MKS 84200HP with laid down capacitors, so instead of 6 small ones I will place two either fat or long and solder them on the side. This will allow it to fit into a G30 with ease.
[2025-06-07T17:25:02] Izuna 生活: Original is 2820uF. After modification only 2000uF probably, but the height will be halfed.
[2025-06-07T18:35:32] Noname: @jamaludin_algarnati We don't need a zoo there's a bear in town
[2025-06-07T19:07:26] Rose: Hey there ︎ ︎ ︎ ︎Настояши влад а4, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-06-07T19:41:20] Matthew: My ex boyfriend weighed 255lbs and was 6'2".... scooters had no issues with his weight
[2025-06-07T19:48:16] Matthew: I randomly bricked a 85150 early in march this year. Messed up while trying to update and stopped mid update. I was never able to get it revived. But before that my Bluetooth kept cutting out and the scooter would stop working then work again until one day after viewing an apartment it died like 1 city block down the road. It ended up being the power button that went bad. Definitely not related to me ruining the vesc
[2025-06-07T19:56:27] Smart Repair: Many small capacitors are better than two large ones. Small ones react much better to voltage fluctuations
[2025-06-07T20:03:51] haku: it be funny if that bear mauls you. but you will survive so its all good
[2025-06-07T20:45:32] Arnau Martinez Casals: Idk
[2025-06-07T20:47:07] skrtt: Mechanically and electronically?
[2025-06-07T20:47:40] Arnau Martinez Casals: I was going downhill with no throttle only braking and when I push throttle doesn’t response. Button stays green. Try to do reset, but it starts bad, doesn’t do the vesc check only the green light on. My bt module receive voltaje cause i can see on phone but can’t connect
[2025-06-07T21:07:05] Matthew: So the experience with him. I was building the ninebot g30lp for him. I figured if it works for him there would be no issues for me as im ~190lbs. So the g30lp was fine with him. I even upgraded to 52v on a stock motor for him. We ended up getting him a tiny and light amazon volpram or whatever brand it carried him around fine. But if you have hills and like a 500watts max motor then you may overheat it. But if its like a 1000+ watts motor then you vaguely dont need to worry about things. Only time we worried about the motor too hot was going into field weakening and 40mph. Could do that regularly but not nonstop. I swear most these motors are all happy until you want to cruise 40mph. They just seem to slowly heatsoak. If youre really worried about it statorade is a very good product to thing about using.
[2025-06-07T21:14:39] Noname: Where the he'll is ebrake set up?
[2025-06-07T21:15:05] Noname: Got the brake throttle mapped but can't find where to implement
[2025-06-07T21:15:43] Matthew: App configurations- adc- adc2 current no reverse brake

[2025-06-07T22:25:59] haku: feel so tired today for some reason
[2025-06-07T22:26:07] Smart Repair: Let's see what the log file says 😀
[2025-06-07T22:26:18] haku: i used all my brain powers yesterday
[2025-06-07T22:26:30] haku: its taking a toll on my body
[2025-06-07T22:26:54] Yamal: work your legs like Kai Greene
[2025-06-07T22:26:59] Yamal: Tired why
[2025-06-07T22:27:05] haku: no idea
[2025-06-07T22:27:18] haku: maybe lazy
[2025-06-07T22:27:42] Yamal: It's normal, sometimes we feel more tired and other times more energetic
[2025-06-07T22:28:18] Yamal: Y0!!!!

[2025-06-07T22:55:17] Yamal: XD
[2025-06-07T22:55:53] Rob Ver: How much volts
[2025-06-07T22:56:08] Rob Ver: And total A battery
[2025-06-07T22:58:40] Yamal: This beast is coming ,,
[2025-06-07T23:02:35] Smart Repair: Front 85A Batt, rear 150A at ~102V
[2025-06-07T23:03:17] Marius: damn boi
[2025-06-07T23:03:33] Marius: what is the top speed so far?
[2025-06-07T23:04:12] haku: this on x12?
[2025-06-07T23:10:47] Smart Repair: I think 118 without fw. I haven't dared to go any further than that yet. But I think with engine power it should be able to do 130-140 km/h. It's just a 22x3, and the GT1 engine in the front has even less KV.
[2025-06-07T23:19:34] Yamal: Imagine that with a brutal torque
[2025-06-07T23:22:57] Rob Ver: So max 23970W 😉
[2025-06-07T23:32:24] Yamal: for now ..
[2025-06-07T23:32:43] Yamal: 26s9p? Wich cells?
[2025-06-07T23:40:58] Smart Repair: Sorry, front 100A and rear 200A Batt
[2025-06-07T23:41:14] Smart Repair: 26s8p p42
[2025-06-07T23:45:24] Yamal: So your nominal is 360A ?
[2025-06-07T23:46:16] Yamal: ?????
[2025-06-07T23:48:06] haku: so looks like 22x3 on higher voltage is the trend now
[2025-06-07T23:48:20] haku: we 20s 33x2 users are so 2022
[2025-06-07T23:49:56] haku: wait till you see @Un_Jason 40s on 17x4
[2025-06-07T23:50:16] Yamal: Even so, 33/2 seems great for a lot of phase.
[2025-06-07T23:50:20] Rob Ver: I have 200A front 200A rear on max settings
[2025-06-07T23:50:51] Yamal: 400x79,2?
[2025-06-07T23:52:21] Rob Ver: But then you get not high phase A. Now I'm at 310A testing if it works and absolute max 390A. For now no overcourrent
[2025-06-07T23:53:11] Yamal: Why no 400abs
[2025-06-07T23:53:24] Rob Ver: 400 on more like 86
[2025-06-07T23:53:24] Yamal: I do 300A phase 400abs
[2025-06-07T23:53:38] Rob Ver: That's the power sag
[2025-06-07T23:54:09] Yamal: I need go up with abs before
[2025-06-07T23:54:31] Rob Ver: I went up and i blow them

[2025-06-07T23:55:00] Rob Ver: 320A 400A
[2025-06-07T23:55:25] Rob Ver: But tolt shuld be stronger but not on the paper
[2025-06-07T23:55:30] Yamal: I never go up 300 A phase with ubox (stock) for safe ..
[2025-06-07T23:56:10] Rob Ver: When I had 150A batt I could bu not at 200A batt
[2025-06-07T23:56:18] Yamal: All good /// temperatures good /// but on a light walk at 30km/h it caught on fire
[2025-06-07T23:56:32] Yamal: Don’t know why
[2025-06-07T23:56:39] Yamal: Now I want mount good BMS

[2025-06-07T23:57:53] Rob Ver: Can't belive that no one did not create foot rest for g30

[2025-06-09T04:05:38] Izuna 生活: Lol. At this point I think I just keep the original capacitors and put a bit of rubber isolation between the bottom plate and spacer and only screw on very loose.
[2025-06-09T04:06:38] haku: it be fun to ride peak g30 in a middle of riots
[2025-06-09T04:07:43] Izuna 生活: 190°C heatbed and soldering iron to the max got them desoldered. Replaced with 8 AWG battery cables now. I still have the 6 AWG Phase wires though...

[2025-06-09T04:45:32] Noname: Extra batterys upgraded suspension etc. It's not horrible actually
[2025-06-09T04:45:53] haku: ill give em 600 max
[2025-06-09T04:46:40] haku: extra batteries not built by me. no thanks
[2025-06-09T04:47:32] haku: also that blue rim should reduce price to 500
[2025-06-09T04:48:07] haku: look like something tim waltz would drive
[2025-06-09T06:30:27] Franchesco Carofano: I broke one, ordered another one and left them at 200ah, they just look good brother.
[2025-06-09T06:35:50] Yamal: 200A phase motor you mean

[2025-06-09T10:13:00] 'lekrsu': Just cut a few strands off the wire.
[2025-06-09T10:13:38] Yamal: ?????
[2025-06-09T10:29:15] Pandalgns: Aliexpress 🤷‍♂
[2025-06-09T10:29:31] Pandalgns: And bad delivery men above all
[2025-06-09T10:47:19] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: do an evolution the same until you keep the BMS
[2025-06-09T11:08:32] Yamal: I've already started the return process. It's worth almost €100, and I'm not going to set up a BMS with a dent like that.😭😫
[2025-06-09T11:15:28] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Someone has experience??? I just ordered one
[2025-06-09T11:17:02] Yamal: <animation>

[2025-06-09T11:49:07] ausias: if anynody knows i would love to know, im interested in buying one of those
[2025-06-09T11:49:11] ausias: or the mks version
[2025-06-09T11:49:28] ausias: IS that for a single motor?
[2025-06-09T13:11:28] Pandalgns: The flipsky one seems to have similar features but a larger screen.
[2025-06-09T14:09:42] Pandalgns: Guys, a question, regarding the throttle settings, to get the most torque and aggressiveness, which of the three types of throttle do you recommend? And the acceleration line at maximum? At zero? How?
[2025-06-09T14:37:47] Smart Repair: Current, 0,00 sec rampingtime
[2025-06-09T14:39:49] Pandalgns: Ok, I'll keep that in mind, but is the type of accelerator very noticeable when accelerating and getting maximum torque from the start?
[2025-06-09T14:48:25] Smart Repair: Rear 450A phase, 200A battery, and 10% saturation compensation. So far, no ABS failures. 💪 Next, I'll go back with the compensation bit by bit.
[2025-06-09T14:48:46] Smart Repair: currently without BEMF
[2025-06-09T14:54:04] Yamal: Nice to see ^^
[2025-06-09T15:12:47] Marius: good shit
[2025-06-09T15:15:03] Marius: kinda crazy how much phase the 22x3 can take

[2025-06-09T16:00:57] Jason: it work
[2025-06-09T16:04:05] Franchesco Carofano: It was the last thing I could get with 200 curren max and it gave a little more without fw
[2025-06-09T16:06:43] Franchesco Carofano: Yes
[2025-06-09T16:07:47] Franchesco Carofano: Those drivers don't support more than that, it's risky.
[2025-06-09T16:13:08] Rose: Hey there Ben, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-06-09T16:15:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes
[2025-06-09T16:16:08] Yamal: Only one controller ?
[2025-06-09T16:16:45] Yamal: Nice power
[2025-06-09T16:20:34] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <sticker>
[2025-06-09T16:20:37] Pandalgns: I guess it's marking the 2 controllers, but it's in the air
[2025-06-09T16:20:55] Yamal: and how much battery discharge do you have per controller?
[2025-06-09T16:24:16] Yamal: I plan to carry 300 A per controller as before, let's see what happens ^^’ I need more phase to move the motors..
[2025-06-09T16:25:14] Yamal: I thought you had a broken controller, I'm glad they're still alive!
[2025-06-09T16:27:09] Pandalgns: It wasn't the controller in the end, it was the front motor hall board that came loose and touched the motor casing and when it shorted out the controller turned off to protect itself, I changed the hall, glued it well so it wouldn't move and reconfigured everything again with some new parameters, let's see the result.
[2025-06-09T16:33:49] ausias: with doble phase cables?
[2025-06-09T16:49:25] Yamal: XD
[2025-06-09T17:00:29] Jason: damn
[2025-06-09T17:02:05] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: that's how it is
[2025-06-09T17:04:21] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: You used to have 250 if I remember correctly.
[2025-06-09T17:11:48] Yamal: I use 300phase /175 battery
[2025-06-09T17:11:52] Yamal: Ubox 85/250
[2025-06-09T17:39:52] Pandalgns: Guys, does saturation compensation work with Hall sensors? Or is it only for sensorless?
[2025-06-09T17:42:47] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I do 100 battery for 350 pahse
[2025-06-09T19:16:30] Matthew: ??? What model scooter you got?
[2025-06-09T19:17:56] Noname: Niu nqi sport
[2025-06-09T19:19:44] Matthew: I used 10% compensation ran as foc
[2025-06-09T19:21:03] Matthew: Foc hall sensors is very good full torque from start zero speed.
[2025-06-09T19:29:23] Matthew: Man, new adjustable shocks are pretty pricey for that scooter
[2025-06-09T19:33:29] Pandalgns: The problem is that with 300a phase and 100 of battery at 60v in my 60h 22x3 of 3000w I give it full throttle from a standstill and they saturate and come out in jerks until the maximum torque section passes, then when it demands less amps it goes well or for example after a time riding that the battery is more discharged like at 60% it no longer saturates the motors. I understand that because the battery cannot offer so much discharge and does not put so much phase to the motors.
[2025-06-09T19:42:16] Noname: Not horrible for 2 large shocks.
[2025-06-09T19:43:07] Matthew: True
[2025-06-09T19:47:11] haku: beatiful
[2025-06-09T19:48:17] skrtt: Anyone here have the rage stem??
[2025-06-09T20:05:48] Yamal: Crazy good
[2025-06-09T20:09:36] Franchesco Carofano: They can't handle that, I had 230 and they burned, it's better to sell it and buy something bigger brother, that control for the engines you have is not going to work for you.
[2025-06-09T20:31:48] Yamal: Time for x12
[2025-06-09T20:32:08] Yamal: But no money bro we poor xD
[2025-06-09T20:34:35] Yamal: We'll see what happens, but if it burns again it will be time to move the parts to the ninebot xD
[2025-06-09T20:34:53] Rob Ver: I had 150A batt and 340A phase on ublox 240
[2025-06-09T20:35:27] Yamal: He burned with 230A
[2025-06-09T20:35:31] Yamal: Stock fet
[2025-06-09T20:35:32] Rob Ver: It depends how high you go with the battery A becouse more battery A less phase A
[2025-06-09T20:35:57] Yamal: I burnet , but my is something strange
[2025-06-09T20:36:10] Yamal: Like waking with the scooter 30kmh
[2025-06-09T20:36:17] Yamal: But we see
[2025-06-09T20:36:49] Rob Ver: I always had same low speed mosfet failing 😆
[2025-06-09T20:38:36] Rob Ver: Well tolt fets are fine for now
[2025-06-09T20:38:42] Yamal: Modifying some uboxes after seeing your results motivates me too!
[2025-06-09T20:38:47] Yamal: EhhhhhHHHHH
[2025-06-09T20:38:53] Yamal: hehe
[2025-06-09T20:39:18] Rob Ver: Allso my frend Patric went to 3000km trip to the Greece
[2025-06-09T20:39:26] Rob Ver: All good with tolt
[2025-06-09T20:39:48] Rob Ver: He had them in ublox 150
[2025-06-09T20:41:13] Yamal: I see that these modifications are excellent, Raphael... he also got them with more than 400 phase and more than 260 drums, meaning it's a very good option for future projects.
[2025-06-09T20:41:36] Rob Ver: What bike is it
[2025-06-09T20:41:54] Rob Ver: <photos/photo_23698@02-06-2025_04-16-58.jpg>
[2025-06-09T20:41:59] Rob Ver: I have this one
[2025-06-09T20:42:13] Yamal: What do you think is good phase A when using 175A battery per controller
[2025-06-09T20:42:16] Yamal: ?
[2025-06-09T20:42:16] Rob Ver: But it's only 48v for now
[2025-06-09T20:42:40] Yamal: My goal is use 300 because my motors 33/2
[2025-06-09T20:43:05] Yamal: They need a path to move xD
[2025-06-09T20:44:34] Rob Ver: I have 200A batt and 310A phase
[2025-06-09T20:44:46] Rob Ver: On 22x3

[2025-06-09T20:47:43] Yamal: I mean with stock fet man ! ^^’
[2025-06-09T20:47:49] Franchesco Carofano: I think what caused the damage was the natural cave, now I left it as it came from the factory.
[2025-06-09T20:48:16] Franchesco Carofano: Because of the temperature, they didn't burn
[2025-06-09T20:48:27] Rob Ver: O had 200A batt and 290A on Hyg015n10ns1ta
[2025-06-09T20:48:39] Rob Ver: On 22s
[2025-06-09T20:49:04] Yamal: For you ,max setting on stock ubox I mean?
[2025-06-09T20:49:14] Yamal: Yours is like xMen controller

[2025-06-09T20:49:39] Franchesco Carofano: I received those from a client
[2025-06-09T20:49:41] Yamal: Wouh get the new one
[2025-06-09T20:50:46] Rob Ver: If some one is near me I can change them for TOLT
[2025-06-09T20:51:07] Rob Ver: It's quite delicate procedure
[2025-06-09T20:51:46] Yamal: We will send you a pallet of controllers so you can change them.
[2025-06-09T20:51:47] Rob Ver: You must always check mosfets under the microscope if all is ok
[2025-06-09T20:51:48] Yamal: ^^

[2025-06-09T20:54:36] Franchesco Carofano: How much have you gotten out of your speed vsett, what controls and battery and motors do you have?
[2025-06-09T20:54:47] Rob Ver: 132kmh
[2025-06-09T20:55:02] Rob Ver: <video_file>
[2025-06-09T20:55:20] Rob Ver: I started slowly to get traction
[2025-06-09T20:55:21] Franchesco Carofano: It's okay, how the parameters go and what controls do you use, battery and motors?
[2025-06-09T20:55:37] Rob Ver: 22s9p ampace jp4p
[2025-06-09T20:55:56] Rob Ver: 80H rear 70H front 22x3
[2025-06-09T20:56:58] Franchesco Carofano: I've been in Nami for 70 hours and I had to open the scissors anyway.
[2025-06-09T20:58:36] Franchesco Carofano: My battery is Molicel 20s 10p p42 motors 70h 22x3 3500watt each motor I managed to get 142km with fw without fw 130
[2025-06-09T21:01:14] Rob Ver: I use 80A FW
[2025-06-09T21:01:43] Rob Ver: Then you have probably 33x2
[2025-06-09T21:02:04] Rob Ver: 22x3 wil free spin 110kmh on 22s
[2025-06-09T21:02:10] Rob Ver: 80H
[2025-06-09T21:02:41] Rob Ver: But now I manage to get them to the 213kmh
[2025-06-09T21:03:04] Rob Ver: But I will not try high speed run

[2025-06-10T11:29:24] Aviv Turg: Hey I have a question, I'm running makerbase 75100 maxed out, I wanted to understand the relation between battery current and phase current, when I input 1 amp of battery I get 20 phase amps, does this make sens?
[2025-06-10T11:29:48] Aviv Turg: <photos/photo_23924@10-06-2025_11-29-48.jpg>
[2025-06-10T11:36:52] Yamal: Well, in my short experience, I think the first thing would be to determine how many phase Amps your motors + phase wiring can handle, how much your battery is capable of discharging safely... and then your controller, what are its safe limits for A battery and A phase and based on all this, put it in a pot and cook it xD
[2025-06-10T11:42:13] Aviv Turg: The motor can run 50 amp dc, so I'm not sure how much ac that means, the relation between dc to ac current is 0.707 for pure sin wave, but, he can also run 100 dc amps for short amount of time so I want to max it as much as possible. I have a 75200 to fit , just curious 🤔
[2025-06-10T12:10:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Weird I do 300a phase 110 battery on the shitsky I have 85240 stashed somewhere that it needs new logic board I plan to fix it and replace the 75200 with it ( you are saying no good idea for the power I want to run?)
[2025-06-10T12:33:26] Jose: What is this 😭😭
[2025-06-10T12:38:47] Jose: Is that scooter yours? @Himkdb

[2025-06-10T13:37:30] Smart Repair: 380A Phase, 480A Abs and 200A Batt That's my absolute maximum, I wouldn't demand more from the controller
[2025-06-10T13:38:13] Yamal: You mean x12
[2025-06-10T13:38:15] Yamal: ?
[2025-06-10T13:39:05] Smart Repair: 85250 had double cables, the new 85240 no longer
[2025-06-10T13:40:04] Smart Repair: No, 85250/240
[2025-06-10T13:40:07] Dualtron Achilleus: He ´s speaking about 85 250
[2025-06-10T13:40:26] Marius: Only 200batt?
[2025-06-10T13:40:30] Marius: Damn
[2025-06-10T13:40:48] Dualtron Achilleus: No need more?
[2025-06-10T13:41:41] Dualtron Achilleus: Crazy
[2025-06-10T13:41:53] Marius: Need more to not have Phase drop
[2025-06-10T13:42:06] Marius: U need more Phase at high speed not less
[2025-06-10T13:42:15] Dualtron Achilleus: Inokim rider are pushing things hard
[2025-06-10T13:42:48] Smart Repair: A 200A battery generates a lot of phase amperes, so I always keep the battery current a little below that.
[2025-06-10T13:43:33] Yamal: 380A phase 🥴🫠🤔🤩
[2025-06-10T13:43:52] Smart Repair: These are my personal experiences, but I'm happy to be proven wrong.
[2025-06-10T13:44:09] Marius: Depends on Motor
[2025-06-10T13:44:34] Smart Repair: Yes, that would be 190A for the 85150. I think that's within the limits.
[2025-06-10T13:44:50] Marius: Sure. Im just saying the more batt amps the Later Ur Phase amps Drop
[2025-06-10T13:45:31] Marius: Close to 100% duty u will only have 200phase
[2025-06-10T13:49:28] Smart Repair: A lot also depends on the cooling. With very good cooling alone, you can achieve at least twice the performance compared to if the ESC is loose. I've also seen people simply glue their controllers to the frame without removing the paint, etc., and then they wonder why their system constantly crashes.
[2025-06-10T13:50:41] Smart Repair: with 26s I haven't managed to get to 95% yet 😅
[2025-06-10T13:51:45] Marius: Yep all depends on how Regularly u drive top speed
[2025-06-10T13:55:16] Smart Repair: And that depends on the motor 🤷‍♂️ It's simply impossible to make a reliable general statement. How much current you can push through the ubox depends on too many factors. It does make a difference whether you're constantly driving at 120 km/h with a 17x4 and 60A fw, or a 33x2 without fw.
[2025-06-10T13:55:49] Smart Repair: what are your maximum values for the 250/240, I would also be interested
[2025-06-10T14:01:47] Smart Repair: What would also be cool is a list of battery, ESC, and motor data, such as maximum speed at a certain amount of current. Basically, a list where everyone can enter their setup. Anyone interested in something like that?
[2025-06-10T14:05:44] Yamal: 80h33/2
[2025-06-10T14:08:20] Smart Repair: 2x 80h 33x2 would be a dream... unfortunately I decided too late for a dual setup, 22x3 was already bought
[2025-06-10T14:22:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Copying dualtron haha
[2025-06-10T14:51:15] Yamal: Thanks for sharing your opinion❤️‍🔥⚡️
[2025-06-10T15:44:03] 'lekrsu': Did you measure thermal glue temps on your steel G2 chassis? Interested in the thermal temps your controller MOSFETs reached!
[2025-06-10T16:21:47] Marius: yep unfortunately too big for g30
[2025-06-10T16:21:58] Marius: gota replace magnets at some point, better than nothing
[2025-06-10T16:26:54] Smart Repair: No, with the G2, I always use a 50x100x10mm (85150) aluminum plate, which I mount between the frame and the ESC with thermal paste. It's important to remove the paint from the frame. I've achieved good results with this.
[2025-06-10T16:27:14] 'lekrsu': What's your temps when you did that?
[2025-06-10T16:28:40] Smart Repair: It's been too long since I last drove the G2. But I have a few customers whose temperatures have always stayed below 50°C.
[2025-06-10T16:30:32] Rose: Hey there fry the guy, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-06-10T16:48:34] Marius: hmmm why the plate?
[2025-06-10T16:48:41] Marius: woudlnt it be better to have direct contact to the frame?
[2025-06-10T16:48:58] Marius: or only for g2 cuz its steel?
[2025-06-10T16:49:37] 'lekrsu': Good to hear, I'm seeing just high of 50C through the paint with thermal pad. If it can go below 50 that sounds great.
[2025-06-10T17:04:01] Yamal: Mount big controller / the problem is finish ?
[2025-06-10T17:05:01] Yamal: Dual x12/ dual 80h33/2 20s6p 50pl xDDDDDDDDDDD

[2025-06-10T19:11:17] A.P: I have a vesc already configured makerbase, now I received the second one identical etc, I connected it via can it reads it etc, how can I take the firmware from the vesc already configured and pass it on
[2025-06-10T19:11:57] A.P: Vesc? I have android phone, vesc tool
[2025-06-10T19:27:22] Pandalgns: In the mobile app I don't know if there is one, I imagine there is, on PC you have an option at the top that is to save engine configuration and another that is to save app configuration, then with the new vesc in the same save section you have another one that is to load the configuration that you have saved
[2025-06-10T19:45:05] Marius: yes dream

[2025-06-10T19:45:52] Marius: what is planned?
[2025-06-10T19:46:07] Rob Ver: Nothing special to keep it light
[2025-06-10T19:47:04] Rob Ver: Wider handle bar, front speed suspension, maybe front motor, vesc 150A and proper brakes
[2025-06-10T19:47:37] Smart Repair: It works very well. Make the back panel metallically bare and place a 10mm aluminum block between it as a buffer.
[2025-06-10T19:48:03] Rob Ver: And battery is now 15Ah instead 10Ah

[2025-06-11T20:26:39] haku: why like weped so much
[2025-06-11T20:42:13] Yamal: I like from before
[2025-06-11T20:43:45] Yamal: I like how they enjoy their e-scooters
[2025-06-11T20:49:25] Aviv Turg: It was the motor rated rpm set too low, if anybody needs that in the future 👍
[2025-06-11T21:00:13] haku: as you can see yamal. im redesigning peak g30v2 from the ground up.
[2025-06-11T21:01:27] haku: as a tester. vesc on nuts phenomenon is real. endless ejaculation feeling
[2025-06-11T21:01:57] haku: my future customers cannot experience that

[2025-06-11T22:12:53] Matthew: V-twin. Cult following. Generally pushing the engine boundaries. I used to go to the drag strip often and some dude on a Ducati he was having issues keeping the front end down even with extended swingarm at 130mph. Has to be a wild ride
[2025-06-11T22:19:30] Matthew: In the subtopics theres a parameters guide. Check it out. And any questions from it someone will chime in and answer a question of yours.

[2025-06-11T23:15:49] haku: its freecad. learning is free
[2025-06-11T23:16:42] haku: if you really want to learn cad and get a diploma @lekrsu has a school
[2025-06-11T23:17:15] Pandalgns: Really?? He's a 3D modeling master?

[2025-06-12T07:14:22] Yamal: @SibClimb
[2025-06-12T07:18:30] Yamal: Are competitors in France using the Tronic X12? Are we looking at what could be one of the best Vesc controllers on the market right now?
[2025-06-12T07:21:21] Yamal: are we obliged to buy them?

[2025-06-12T08:37:28] Lieven L.: The motor concept and dry clutch makes it much more exciting than any other sports bike. Especially the older ones.

[2025-06-12T19:15:58] Noname: @Spintend hurry up with a bigger controller. We're impatiently waiting
[2025-06-12T19:27:21] skrtt: @jamaludin_algarnati
[2025-06-12T19:27:46] skrtt: I think u told me that i cant put 33x2 motors in minimotors controller
[2025-06-12T19:27:59] skrtt: Is that because its a squarewave controller?
[2025-06-12T19:29:15] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, don't know, still say c350
[2025-06-12T19:33:20] Yamal: What you mean
[2025-06-12T19:33:44] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes some are using X12
[2025-06-12T19:33:46] Yamal: No
[2025-06-12T19:33:56] Yamal: Is because 33/2
[2025-06-12T19:33:56] Face de Pin Sucé: I will still recommend C350 as controllers
[2025-06-12T19:34:33] Yamal: With that winding you will heat the controllers a lot.
[2025-06-12T19:34:44] Yamal: Until cooking soul

[2025-06-12T19:36:07] Yamal: correct me if I'm wrong
[2025-06-12T19:37:38] Yamal: Why
[2025-06-12T19:37:59] Yamal: I want to learn really! And listen new things and opinions
[2025-06-12T19:38:13] Yamal: For me they are all valid
[2025-06-12T19:39:54] Finn: More amps for same torque
[2025-06-12T19:40:35] Marius: needs more fets daniel said
[2025-06-12T19:40:37] Marius: something something physics
[2025-06-12T20:54:48] Matthew: That's what im wondering about. What makes 33x2 dangerous for controllers other than needing to push high current for torque. If youre just cruising with spirited runs, is that configuration dangerous?
[2025-06-12T20:55:13] Marius: apparently the low resistance
[2025-06-12T20:55:25] Marius: according to daniel
[2025-06-12T20:55:40] Marius: can be dangerous for certain escs
[2025-06-12T20:55:54] Matthew: Big voltage spikes?
[2025-06-12T20:56:03] Marius: idk ask him

[2025-06-12T21:32:12] Marius: gonna be worse no?
[2025-06-12T21:32:18] Marius: ur not voltage limited rn

[2025-06-12T22:21:38] Dualtron Achilleus: xdd why you write this
[2025-06-12T22:21:54] Dualtron Achilleus: yeah could be good if other brand

[2025-06-12T22:44:03] haku: people just buy a stock inmotion RS or whatever is the most reccomended and run with it. mostly china generic frame scooters
[2025-06-12T22:44:50] haku: but let me tell you something. im a trendsetter peak g30v2. best of both worlds my boy.

[2025-06-13T00:24:06] Jose: Molicel
[2025-06-13T00:24:18] Jose: Makes sense
[2025-06-13T00:24:33] Dualtron Achilleus: but 2p is like 100 A peak
[2025-06-13T00:24:36] Jose: 80p with 4p my failt
[2025-06-13T00:24:39] Jose: Fault
[2025-06-13T00:24:58] Jose: 180A nominal
[2025-06-13T00:25:11] Dualtron Achilleus: 45A per cell peak
[2025-06-13T00:25:14] Dualtron Achilleus: if 45 b

[2025-06-13T00:25:22] Jose: Em
[2025-06-13T00:25:34] Jose: Its late hahah srry
[2025-06-13T00:25:45] Dualtron Achilleus: but how the fuck
[2025-06-13T00:25:51] Dualtron Achilleus: you got 80 hp power
[2025-06-13T00:25:55] Jose: Cause its 300v
[2025-06-13T00:25:56] Dualtron Achilleus: with such low disharge
[2025-06-13T00:26:10] Dualtron Achilleus: but V is for speed
[2025-06-13T00:26:11] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Bro has better motors then me and ask for sponsor 😉
[2025-06-13T00:26:12] Jose: V×A=W

[2025-06-13T00:26:38] haku: on 50pl
[2025-06-13T00:26:48] Jose: Makes no sense

[2025-06-13T00:27:16] Jose: So much voltaje so litl capacity
[2025-06-13T00:29:04] Dualtron Achilleus: yeah but
[2025-06-13T00:29:11] haku: in the end isnt it watt hours?
[2025-06-13T00:29:27] Dualtron Achilleus: torque isnt about A disharge?
[2025-06-13T00:29:44] haku: depend on winding
[2025-06-13T00:29:45] Dualtron Achilleus: or maybe the motor kv is really lowww
[2025-06-13T00:29:58] Dualtron Achilleus: like 10kv or less
[2025-06-13T00:30:04] Dualtron Achilleus: and only need 100A bat
[2025-06-13T00:30:08] Jose: I dont think so
[2025-06-13T00:30:30] Dualtron Achilleus: but phase amp relate also to batterie amps
[2025-06-13T00:30:43] Dualtron Achilleus: so the motor kv should be really low
[2025-06-13T00:32:11] Dualtron Achilleus: okay yeah voltage matter
[2025-06-13T00:32:31] Dualtron Achilleus: dude what controlor for 300 V xd

[2025-06-13T00:46:12] 'lekrsu': Some wobble, loud from oversized holes, fender doesn't fit :)
[2025-06-13T00:46:55] 'lekrsu': Stock felt like a dream after switching back :)
[2025-06-13T00:47:08] 'lekrsu': That is, if yours isn't bent
[2025-06-13T00:48:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But if u get battery made from those cells brooooo
[2025-06-13T00:48:52] 'lekrsu': Hoping the thermal epoxy holds up or else scooter teardown tomorrow again :)
[2025-06-13T00:50:00] Jose: How did you adapt the motor support
[2025-06-13T00:50:03] skrtt: Then send me some shekel so i can make it
[2025-06-13T00:50:20] 'lekrsu': By picking info from James mind
[2025-06-13T00:50:52] Jose: Do you think you can make another one?
[2025-06-13T00:50:55] Jose: 👉🏻👈🏻
[2025-06-13T00:50:56] 'lekrsu': Involves bushings, longer shoulder bolts and moved forks
[2025-06-13T00:51:12] Jose: But no different pieces?
[2025-06-13T00:51:15] 'lekrsu': Couple bucks on Ali
[2025-06-13T00:51:19] Jose: Like
[2025-06-13T00:51:33] Jose: You just extended the ejes
[2025-06-13T00:51:46] 'lekrsu': 115mm dropout to 150mm dropout:)
[2025-06-13T00:51:50] Jose: My english is horrible in tecnical vocabulary
[2025-06-13T00:53:14] Jose: But just make bigger the space between chasis and motor arms?
[2025-06-13T00:53:32] Jose: With washers and longer bolts
[2025-06-13T00:53:40] 'lekrsu': bushings, not washers
[2025-06-13T00:53:55] 'lekrsu': Was about 1cm bushings if I'm not mistaken

[2025-06-13T00:54:10] Jose: Aaah

[2025-06-13T00:54:18] Jose: Washer
[2025-06-13T00:55:09] 'lekrsu': Softer material, self lubricating
[2025-06-13T00:55:27] 'lekrsu': Such as copper/brass to steel frame. Steel to steel would rip themselves.
[2025-06-13T00:55:58] skrtt: Dualtron guys

[2025-06-13T17:23:27] Ken Kaneki: <photos/photo_23972@13-06-2025_17-23-27.jpg>
[2025-06-13T17:23:30] Ken Kaneki: please help me, and it's the first time I use these control units how do I connect them together and also to bluetooth thanks
[2025-06-13T17:57:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Connector with black and white wires from each vesc together to communicate between them
[2025-06-13T18:15:25] Ken Kaneki: and with Bluetooth?
[2025-06-13T18:16:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Bluetooth the connector might need modding
[2025-06-13T18:17:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also didn't u got an instruction page ?
[2025-06-13T18:19:10] Ken Kaneki: It’s new for me sorry hahahah
[2025-06-13T18:19:22] Noname: I never have and I own 5 vesc
[2025-06-13T18:20:09] Ken Kaneki: I have and i don’t understand the tipe wire conection
[2025-06-13T18:20:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Flipsky and makerbase gives them incloded
[2025-06-13T18:21:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: They show there how to roughly connect
[2025-06-13T18:21:53] Ken Kaneki: Have the link video?
[2025-06-13T18:23:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Bluetooth is there
[2025-06-13T18:23:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But the cable going out from there has different connector
[2025-06-13T18:25:15] Ken Kaneki: and also for the display
[2025-06-13T18:25:56] Ken Kaneki: <photos/photo_23974@13-06-2025_18-25-56.jpg>
[2025-06-13T18:26:14] Ken Kaneki: I should invert the orange with the green
[2025-06-13T18:26:20] Ken Kaneki: Right?
[2025-06-13T18:28:46] Ken Kaneki: then last question is it enough to connect the white and black to make them work together or do I have to connect something else together for the accelerator
[2025-06-13T19:24:32] Matthew: No, the vesc units will communicate with the single line
[2025-06-13T19:27:13] Matthew: The vesc units operate as a main and secondary. Secondary just follows the values you have programmed for primary vesc. But for programming each unit individually for more power split say 50amps front motor and 100amp rear motor. Others here should know how to program each individually
[2025-06-13T19:28:50] Ken Kaneki: Okay tnx
[2025-06-13T19:29:20] Ken Kaneki: Because I have difficult for wiring

[2025-06-13T21:52:16] haku: lean haku is a mean haku. might not be funny videos anymore. very intimidatimg
[2025-06-13T21:52:17] Marius: yes but with higher bf that asian chiseled jawline will be less visible
[2025-06-13T21:58:14] Rogerio Figueiredo: She is a minor so not allowed 😂 😂
[2025-06-13T21:58:55] haku: what is minor in france?
[2025-06-13T21:59:14] haku: 15 according to bridgette right?
[2025-06-13T21:59:18] Marius: do the women have their own racing division?
[2025-06-13T21:59:58] haku: who cares. im not a creep. im here for the athlete
[2025-06-13T22:00:52] haku: how old is she for real? i might be monitored by international feds. fuck
[2025-06-13T22:01:30] haku: imo i think scooter racing is the best female sport
[2025-06-13T22:02:17] Marius: i cant think of a single sport thats fun to look at tbh
[2025-06-13T22:03:04] Marius: dw you have been under our surveillance for a long time now
[2025-06-13T22:03:14] haku: fuck
[2025-06-13T22:03:48] skrtt: They are jealous with rage 🤓
[2025-06-13T22:03:49] haku: i love bridgette
[2025-06-13T22:04:34] haku: this is what i mean! didnt i tell you boys. they will only get more fans if female only
[2025-06-13T22:05:00] haku: i think men shouldnt compete in womens sports
[2025-06-13T22:05:16] Marius: are women actually superiour in these sports?
[2025-06-13T22:05:28] Marius: is it because the scooters are power limited so weight makes a huge difference?
[2025-06-13T22:05:49] skrtt: Thats true. But skill is skill no matter the gender imo
[2025-06-13T22:05:54] Marius: idk anything about scooter racing
[2025-06-13T22:05:54] haku: yes dude. i had a whole article written about this backed by science data
[2025-06-13T22:06:31] haku: female biology is superior for racing scooters
[2025-06-13T22:06:39] haku: balance and coordination
[2025-06-13T22:07:06] Marius: idk how the genders compare im just curious on how this works
[2025-06-13T22:07:20] Marius: i havent looked into this at all, i only know these ppl drive fatass scooters which i dont like
[2025-06-13T22:08:39] Marius: tomorrow i shall assemble the kweld, german quality none of that china shit
[2025-06-13T22:08:52] haku: thats just eu propaganda
[2025-06-13T22:09:17] haku: glitter 811h undefeated champ
[2025-06-13T22:09:19] Marius: so tell me which china welder can control energy in the welds
[2025-06-13T22:09:38] haku: who cares aslong as it can weld .3
[2025-06-13T22:09:45] Marius: consistent welds is the key
[2025-06-13T22:10:05] haku: it is consistent. need to learn the technique
[2025-06-13T22:10:14] Marius: scientifically doenst make sense
[2025-06-13T22:10:28] Marius: controlled total energy is the most important thing
[2025-06-13T22:11:11] Marius: maybe i will believe you after you actually test top speed of the peak g30v2
[2025-06-13T22:11:19] haku: no idea. if it welds and sticks thats good in my book. and glitter 811h is permanent welds
[2025-06-13T22:11:21] Marius: get some gear and go test it, land of the free after all
[2025-06-13T22:11:55] haku: need to go to a track. pay fees and shit
[2025-06-13T22:12:09] haku: road is dangerous full of cars
[2025-06-13T22:12:21] Marius: whats the speed limit on normal roads?
[2025-06-13T22:12:25] Marius: go at night
[2025-06-13T22:12:28] haku: i bet peak g30 v2 can go 60mph
[2025-06-13T22:12:30] Marius: or sunday morning
[2025-06-13T22:12:40] Marius: normal road sunday morning
[2025-06-13T22:12:43] haku: no zombies will catch you at night
[2025-06-13T22:12:50] Marius: so ur scared
[2025-06-13T22:12:57] haku: sunday is the lords day
[2025-06-13T22:13:06] haku: ofcourse
[2025-06-13T22:13:16] Marius: and the lord doesnt want you to drive the peakg30 on sundays?
[2025-06-13T22:13:29] haku: he does but not speed testing
[2025-06-13T22:13:41] Marius: sounds like bunch of excuses
[2025-06-13T22:13:56] Marius: i thought haku industries is all about pushing the boundaries of electric vehicles
[2025-06-13T22:14:15] haku: lol. wait till i weld physical brakes. i blow my fets im fucked
[2025-06-13T22:14:25] Marius: gear
[2025-06-13T22:14:32] Marius: at 60mph u can slide and be totally fine
[2025-06-13T22:14:39] haku: helmet only requirement here
[2025-06-13T22:14:47] Marius: cant slide with helmet
[2025-06-13T22:15:00] haku: dont have pesos for gear
[2025-06-13T22:15:24] haku: and who wears gear anyway? you want a gun show when riding
[2025-06-13T22:15:25] Marius: lend some from friends
[2025-06-13T22:15:34] Marius: only for top speed test
[2025-06-13T22:15:47] haku: that time will come
[2025-06-13T22:15:55] Marius: promise?
[2025-06-13T22:15:58] haku: peak g30v3 will super refined
[2025-06-13T22:16:03] haku: yes
[2025-06-13T22:16:09] Marius: no i wanna see it on the v2
[2025-06-13T22:16:16] Marius: the claimed 60mph doesnt mean anything without testing
[2025-06-13T22:16:29] haku: 50mph is already proven
[2025-06-13T22:16:38] Marius: u have vid?
[2025-06-13T22:16:47] haku: no i have logs
[2025-06-13T22:16:52] Noname: And the surrons just went by my house to the cemetery
[2025-06-13T22:16:56] Marius: for the 60mph run u need a vid
[2025-06-13T22:16:59] Marius: i hate logs its boring
[2025-06-13T22:17:00] haku: and gps side by side
[2025-06-13T22:18:09] haku: <photos/photo_23172@11-05-2025_03-14-34.jpg>
[2025-06-13T22:18:46] haku: i only believe gps. you can always cheat speed on logs
[2025-06-13T22:19:05] Marius: agreed
[2025-06-13T22:19:22] Marius: also cant have the anus exposed standing riders have higher topspeed than tactical seat
[2025-06-13T22:20:24] haku: top speed is not my thing. cant go on highways nowadays
[2025-06-13T22:20:37] Marius: need to test it once then never again
[2025-06-13T22:20:42] Marius: just to know what the vehicle is capable of
[2025-06-13T22:22:47] haku: peak g30v2 is not meant for top speed. its a urban tactical vehicle thats meant to carve corners and avoid drones
[2025-06-13T22:23:09] haku: thats whats its designed for
[2025-06-13T22:23:10] Marius: what if multiple drones are coming from all the small streets and force u onto the highway?
[2025-06-13T22:23:14] Marius: then you need to outrun them
[2025-06-13T22:23:17] Marius: topspeed needed
[2025-06-13T22:23:38] haku: no need. just shoot em
[2025-06-13T22:24:02] Marius: cant shoot themm all
[2025-06-13T22:24:11] Marius: they also might be loaded with all kinds of explosives
[2025-06-13T22:24:33] Marius: theres a reason tanks can go 60mph
[2025-06-13T22:24:52] haku: trust me i can
[2025-06-13T22:25:04] Marius: vehicles need to be versatile
[2025-06-13T22:25:20] haku: mine is bulletproof up to 9mm
[2025-06-13T22:25:52] Noname: Here at Haku industries we strive to build the most Versatile urban assault vehicles man has ever seen
[2025-06-13T22:26:12] Marius: yes, and versatility included top speed
[2025-06-13T22:26:26] haku: thats right. thats my vice lead engineer right there @NewTurtle7815
[2025-06-13T22:26:49] Noname: Top speed is relevant to vehicle size and use case on the battlefield.
[2025-06-13T22:27:07] haku: its designed for recon missions
[2025-06-13T22:27:11] Marius: u never know what kinds of situations u could end up being in
[2025-06-13T22:27:21] Marius: even if its just one time, it could save some soldiers life
[2025-06-13T22:27:56] haku: self driving will be implimemted too
[2025-06-13T22:28:00] Noname: We can't overcome physics but as head of the moped department I can assure you we have the speed

[2025-06-13T23:32:19] haku: the dualtrons?
[2025-06-13T23:32:59] Pandalgns: Have you really never looked at Dualtron prices?
[2025-06-13T23:33:23] haku: no. never been interested in c type suspension style scooters
[2025-06-13T23:33:59] haku: maybe alot in new york or LA. not sure.

[2025-06-13T23:37:18] haku: i sourced my own batteries
[2025-06-13T23:37:25] haku: most expensive part
[2025-06-13T23:38:05] Pandalgns: Although I also get the impression that here in Spain (I don't know about the rest of Europe) scooters and accessories etc etc are much more expensive than in other countries.
[2025-06-13T23:38:14] haku: i see
[2025-06-13T23:38:38] haku: scooters very trendy there eh?
[2025-06-13T23:38:57] Pandalgns: It depends on the city
[2025-06-13T23:40:06] haku: what about euc and surrons style bikes?
[2025-06-13T23:40:16] ausias: surrons naa
[2025-06-13T23:40:21] ausias: euc not that much
[2025-06-13T23:43:15] Pandalgns: I couldn't tell you, in fact, here where I live, compared to other more populated cities like Madrid, Barcelona, ​​southern Seville and places like that, there are hardly any scooters and the ones that there are are mostly low-end scooters that are used to travel to work and little else, here there is no passion for scooters or modifying them, in all my time on scooters I only saw a Dualtron X from a Chinese guy who owns a restaurant and a BMW M4 Competition and a Dualtron Victor Luxury, and little else, a lot of smartgyro and junk like that, in fact, apart from the Dualtron X, I think the most powerful and modified thing I saw is mine 😅😅

[2025-06-14T20:53:56] Matthew: This guy showed up in our group earlier this week but he says he isn't able to post or respond in the group. He was saying he may need special permission from a moderator I think???

[2025-06-14T22:57:13] Unknown: 150 Battery Amps and 250 Phase Amps
[2025-06-14T22:58:42] Anthony Meza: U already slacked idk how u still walking. Yes me talking shiiii didn't u call me out when I first got in. Calling me a fed! 🖕
[2025-06-14T22:58:57] Yamal: What happened to me in a Ubox was something strange, ruled out that it was due to excess amps because I was going 30kmh at that time and before that while driving since I turned it on I had not given any strong acceleration or anything, that is to say I was going for a walk. We assume that it could be something that got into the controller, "dirt" from having them so exposed. However, I am going to continue like this, since we are almost in summer and nothing will happen, we will see how it goes! I hope you do not encounter any more problems, enjoy the season of good weather!
[2025-06-14T22:59:25] haku: get fucked then. your not my friend

[2025-06-14T23:02:29] skrtt: I regret inviting u here
[2025-06-14T23:04:27] Matthew: So for detection for the motors should run on vesc tool. Go to setup wizard
[2025-06-14T23:04:41] Matthew: Setup motors click
[2025-06-14T23:04:43] Dualtron Achilleus: You can already do it by register real data from vesc
[2025-06-14T23:05:00] Dualtron Achilleus: If speed is correct
[2025-06-14T23:05:23] Matthew: Use generic direct drive. Use large outrunner for the type of motor
[2025-06-14T23:08:23] Matthew: Click run or detect i forget specific and make sure your motors are secured and off the ground or anything touching the wheels because the setup wizard is going to make the motors spin to detect what it needs to. Once detection is finished theres a tab to select for fwd motor movement and click that and make sure motors are spinning correct direction. You may need to invert directions to have proper forward rotation

[2025-06-15T01:49:29] Matthew: After you do motor configuration see what the detection results are. Sometimes running the wizard again can help fix an issue
[2025-06-15T01:49:32] Anthony Meza: Wym gyro shiii
[2025-06-15T01:49:42] Anthony Meza: Where's the gyro

[2025-06-15T01:50:23] Matthew: Euc and one wheel is most popular and I guess older standing segways
[2025-06-15T01:51:06] Anthony Meza: Gimmy a sec I screen shot

[2025-06-15T01:52:39] Matthew: I know nothing about balance boards and euc. I would love to ride one of them surf board things that have a ton of power
[2025-06-15T01:53:24] Anthony Meza: Honestly I think I have a fw misconfiguration. But I'm trying to eliminate everything else. My vesc is a flipskys dual alu pcb 200a 75100 V2

[2025-06-15T02:19:37] Anthony Meza: Halls are alive but cant be detected . I'm starting to believe I got a bad sensor . And I'd hate to have to dissect motor.
[2025-06-15T02:20:01] haku: maybe halls bad. its hard to tell tbh
[2025-06-15T02:21:44] Anthony Meza: Ooh ok na it's a scooter 🛴 k14 K-Cloud

[2025-06-15T02:23:03] haku: yea. not reading the halls looks like
[2025-06-15T02:23:16] haku: its only on front motor?
[2025-06-15T02:23:31] haku: rear motor okay?
[2025-06-15T02:23:55] Anthony Meza: It's a no name generic brand motor but it's rating is 5kw 15 pole pairs. ~2000g
[2025-06-15T02:27:01] Anthony Meza: So esc has all greens lights no blinking red lights. I'm trying to test master (rear) halls/foc (all settings and values I believe are well under limits for testing but I still get this nasty ass error. So to answer ur question I think I'm doing both rear n frnt
[2025-06-15T02:27:53] haku: it should have separate detection results
[2025-06-15T02:31:35] Anthony Meza: There's values generated. some rule about doing one at a time and generating values then running senserless mode first then switch to sensors and apply (motor config) run and still get that error .

Which esc Is best use with vesc_tool and my build? I think flipsky has a few bugs. Ubox | spintend | makerX | stormcore Or what about the esc's that surron uses. Not sure which are they if any body can send some knowledge this way, ill read all yalls feedback.

[2025-06-15T21:02:51] Anthony Meza: So I learned how to calculate watt rating by going volts (100v) times amps(100) can POSSIBLY (with cooling) get you up to 10kw.
[2025-06-15T21:03:35] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If it's the stock battery, I think it will suffer.😉
[2025-06-15T21:04:25] Anthony Meza: This one on the other hand, can produce (85v x 240a) 20kw (I assume with cooling too) man it seems someone put these here for me to check em out. 🤙 I rather buy this one for sure.
[2025-06-15T21:05:19] Anthony Meza: Ooh OK. . I can't set it to config my battery spec? Then when I upgrade battery pack I can switch up values?? Or no?

[2025-06-15T21:09:05] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Of course you can, man, why can't you tell us the specifications of your battery? Hehe. Do you have a 20s? If it's a 40Ah battery, it's an 8p with LGM50LT cells. I don't recommend more than 135A in total.
[2025-06-15T21:24:10] Anthony Meza: Kinda blurry ..
[2025-06-15T21:25:26] Anthony Meza: Ayo How do I determine the max amps my battery take do. It's a 40ah . Thanks

[2025-06-15T21:36:29] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: You need to know the type of cell you have, but if it's a Nami 40ah, they are LGM50LT 14.5x8 parallel cells. The battery has a discharge capacity of 116A, no more. You can play a little with the peaks, but it's not advisable, which is why I didn't want to say much more than 135A before.
[2025-06-15T22:29:11] Matthew: From people here and my own experience spintend has been good and I recommend their stuff. Their customer support is good too. If you want controllers you won't outgrow i recommend the 85250 and you would need 2 of them. But for space reasons and also reasons the the 85150 can produce some amazing numbers. These guys got some crazy power but for my experience 50 battery per motor on 85150 and vsett 10 motors was wild. I was getting around 10kw @ 18s
[2025-06-15T22:30:18] Matthew: Spintend throttle is directly compatible with their vesc units. Others would have to give you their input on the dedicated 75100v2 controllers... I don't know them

[2025-06-16T04:41:02] Anthony Meza: Yo that's exactly what's going on. Lol tryna be supper careful.

[2025-06-16T07:54:27] D: If I want to use VESC with a original Ninebot G30 dashboard, can I just plug in the dashboard and my e-brake and throttle will work? (They are connected with the dashboard) Or do I have to plug them seperately into the VESC?
[2025-06-16T07:59:20] Yamal: XD❤️‍🔥
[2025-06-16T08:40:51] Anthony Meza: Almost there.
[2025-06-16T08:43:02] Anthony Meza: With my experience, when i changed or upgraded one part, if affects others components either wire config or re mapping of device and esc. But if you have an idea what ur doing, I think u can find workarounds. Best of luck bro don't fry ur shii and remember to switch out if 10ADC when probing . I popped my qs-s4 throttle once

[2025-06-16T10:53:32] Anthony Meza: Does a phenomenal job explaining to me what every aspect of these shiits do .🫤 just gta tell it the right shit . And dude, fuk the education system. Knowledge should be free. But aye.. to each there own .

[2025-06-16T12:04:03] Rob Ver: To big for me I can bearly fit 240A inside. But I will probably not gain any performance with them anyway.

[2025-06-16T12:22:28] francois schempers: someone has the manual for ubox alu 85v 240A ?

[2025-06-16T19:06:31] cihan: I have a question. When building a split battery which is better option? External battery connected in series or parallel? I'll use regen brake and it's a must. I'll use like 2000W for front wheel regen. Thanks in advance
[2025-06-16T19:12:04] haku: not sure @Un_Jason and @NetworkDir did
[2025-06-16T19:13:15] cihan: Another option is making the battery fully external and leaving the deck for controller, BMS. I think I can mount 200 18650 on the stem. It'll add extra 10 kg on the stem. Would it make steering too hard and create high speed stability problems?
[2025-06-16T19:24:51] Jason: oo
[2025-06-16T19:25:16] Pandalgns: This display you say guys
[2025-06-16T19:25:55] Pandalgns: <video_file>
[2025-06-16T19:31:23] Matthew: Yes, I need this hehe
[2025-06-16T19:31:29] Matthew: 😍
[2025-06-16T19:31:50] Pandalgns: But this one is not even touch-sensitive and has no functions other than those you see in the video, only speed information, phase and battery amps, voltage, and odometer.
[2025-06-16T19:32:41] Noname: Parallel. You can have one stop working or removed for temporary space and scoot still works.
[2025-06-16T19:32:46] Pandalgns: But, for 10 euros it's a good display 😂😂
[2025-06-16T19:45:56] haku: i think also @SmartRepair_NRW made one i think
[2025-06-16T19:46:15] haku: waiting for jason to make mini one
[2025-06-16T19:53:26] skrtt: What pads do u use?
[2025-06-16T19:53:33] skrtt: Galfer?
[2025-06-16T19:54:41] Yamal: Aliespresssssss one xD
[2025-06-16T19:54:56] Yamal: Semimetalic for the moment
[2025-06-16T20:01:37] cihan: Parallel connection creates issues with charging, regen. I'll need separate wires for charging, regen and motor power probably or use ideal diode and schottky diode together. Fully external battery seems to be less complicated and better design. Problem is adding too much weight to stem. Or I could make a rack on top of the rear wheel for battery which is much better and lowers center of gravity compared to stem mount.
[2025-06-16T20:06:21] Noname: Parallel is + to + and - to -. I have 3 batterys in parallel 2 are huge beasts 1 is 3p. They all charge/ discharge togeather
[2025-06-16T20:07:29] Noname: Series is. pos neg+pos neg. That's the pain in the ass way

[2025-06-16T20:39:49] 'lekrsu': why's it so good for cleaning
[2025-06-16T20:40:21] 'lekrsu': <sticker>
[2025-06-16T20:44:33] Noname: I've used silicone spray to clean stuff too. If it penetrates into substance it makes that thing slick.
[2025-06-16T20:45:10] 'lekrsu': Depends on the use :) I use silicone spray too but not for this
[2025-06-16T20:52:34] Matthew: Always plotting his revenge. He wants anus exposed owner
[2025-06-16T20:55:00] skrtt: Hmmm
[2025-06-16T20:55:30] skrtt: Im gonna change to purple galfer tomorrow lets see if they are any good
[2025-06-16T20:56:13] Matthew: Touch would be nice but I honestly have my vesc parameters set where I like and would prefer to just turn the scooter on and have telemetry so I can see how hot stuff get, soc, and speed. Those are all things I hate guessing, I trashed an external lipo not know what state of charge it was at and "guessed" it would make the last few miles without issues... $300 pack into the trash was 2s6p 31.3Ah 😭😭😭😭
[2025-06-16T20:58:36] Matthew: That's why dude said chat gpt isn't good for vesc. You can ask for battery specs and I guess what controllers are available and industry used in.
[2025-06-16T20:59:04] Pandalgns: Well, if all you want is telemetry, this display will be good for you since it only has telemetry and it's super cheap. Besides, you have my handlebar support design (for standard MTB handlebars) on the networkdir github.
[2025-06-16T20:59:52] ✨🇪🇸عمر: 220a???
[2025-06-16T20:59:56] Matthew: Lemme know because I need to get pads. Also for xiaomi brake caliper pads I use sintered metal pads and they work great on a 140mm rotor.
[2025-06-16T20:59:56] ✨🇪🇸عمر: on 6mos?
[2025-06-16T21:00:13] Pandalgns: Now I'm thinking about how to design the display for this handlebar, but it's complicated.

[2025-06-16T21:01:43] Matthew: I had spikes up that high when first learning my 85150. Someone else told me they're demanding 230phase and 150battery on 20s. I have a 85250 rn and 90 battery and 220phase.
[2025-06-16T21:02:56] Matthew: Them handlebar is sexy
[2025-06-16T21:05:22] haku: inmotion euc already bought him and contracted to kill me in my sleep
[2025-06-16T21:05:56] Matthew: I bought this for my g30p build. Chopping the pole down quite a bit and got a cruiser handlebar

[2025-06-16T21:17:00] skrtt: Try to use the 2 bolts underneath the handlebar
[2025-06-16T21:17:40] Pandalgns: I'm missing the thread of one of them 😭😭

[2025-06-16T21:18:23] haku: tbh when these dogs are in full gallop. EUC riders need skills to slow down. thats why i tie him to my hip seated. if i go down he goes down with me. ride or die
[2025-06-16T21:20:08] haku: they can run up to 17-18mph full gallop
[2025-06-16T21:42:23] cihan: Parallel connection is more like 2 batteries working together, series is more like still one battery but there's high resistance problem. Making one big external battery seems to be best of both worlds but I don't know where to put it. I think making stem too heavy won't be any good. Is there anyone who has made the battery completely external before?
[2025-06-16T21:43:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes
[2025-06-16T21:45:31] Noname: Yeah have a 16s6p on my Vsett 11 stem
[2025-06-16T21:49:23] Noname: Tricycle handlebars?
[2025-06-16T21:51:37] Jose: How much is that?
[2025-06-16T21:53:04] cihan: With 21700 cells? How is riding/stability with extra weight on the stem and front wheel?
[2025-06-16T21:53:55] skrtt: #carbonfiber 😭😭
[2025-06-16T22:11:11] Noname: 18650. You don't notice after a while. Just can't put helmet on kickstand side it'll topple over lol
[2025-06-16T22:14:58] Noname: But vsett 11 Is kind of a tank. On a g30 the weight would suck

[2025-06-17T01:32:47] Jose: 30€ you have it
[2025-06-17T01:32:58] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: bruh
[2025-06-17T01:33:05] Jose: Or some machinists make them for 20€
[2025-06-17T01:33:06] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Why y'all shortening bars?
[2025-06-17T01:33:18] Jose: Stability

[2025-06-17T01:33:53] Matthew: Man, my pit bull years ago. I had to ride a dawned bicycle to exercise him. He would go for miles on end fast. So we ride around the neighborhood until he just sat down at the intersection to go home... then hes done 😵
[2025-06-17T01:33:55] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: So it's already low xD
[2025-06-17T01:35:00] Jose: A litl
[2025-06-17T01:35:08] Jose: But thw most important is the interior
[2025-06-17T01:35:16] Jose: What are you using
[2025-06-17T01:35:21] Jose: Electronic
[2025-06-17T01:35:59] Matthew: <photos/photo_24053@17-06-2025_01-35-59.jpg>
[2025-06-17T01:38:57] Matthew: There's 3d printed brackets for different sized bags to securely hold a battery pack.
[2025-06-17T01:41:38] Matthew: Damn. Yeah, I kinda dont know where to go at times. Sometimes I remember things I wanted to try and my blank mind forgets I can ask the groups.... but it seems this will work for me. Its just expensive. I think being in usa some of our options are very limited to some options you guy got on that side of the puddle.
[2025-06-17T01:42:09] Jose: Ask to a machinist
[2025-06-17T01:42:21] Jose: Its a easy piece to make
[2025-06-17T01:44:05] Matthew: Yeah, I ain't got no hook ups for machinist. A machines would charge well over $100 here. Hell, some of the machines these guys have are charging over $200hr. I wanted to 3d print but titanium and stainless steel were both insanely expensive.
[2025-06-17T01:45:55] Jose: 💀💀
[2025-06-17T01:46:16] Jose: You can make it with a monorim adaptor and some bolts
[2025-06-17T01:46:19] Jose: At least on xiaomo
[2025-06-17T01:46:23] Jose: Xiaomi
[2025-06-17T01:46:32] Jose: At ninebot im kot sure
[2025-06-17T01:46:34] Jose: Not*
[2025-06-17T01:47:55] Matthew: Im 5'9". I am the perfect mold for most anything designed in this world... so most everything works well size wise for me. My hands just big af xxxl size glove 😵
[2025-06-17T01:47:57] Noname: I put a tin pie plate in my pants to protect my anus. I tried using a old steering wheel but it "drove me nuts"
[2025-06-17T01:48:26] Jose: And dont you have aliexpress on usa?
[2025-06-17T01:48:45] Matthew: I know how to use manual mill and manual lathe.... it's just not my equipment or shop
[2025-06-17T01:48:59] Matthew: Its from ali order
[2025-06-17T01:49:13] Jose: Just buy it from there then
[2025-06-17T01:49:28] Matthew: I did. Same price
[2025-06-17T01:49:44] Matthew: That's the part I have. Bought from ali
[2025-06-17T01:49:45] Jose: Criminal

[2025-06-17T01:54:04] Noname: It's gay af
[2025-06-17T01:55:29] Matthew: Medical and recreational is everywhere in the states these days. Im "out of town" so thats why im using a cart. I normally consume live resin extracts, flower, and Kief. Kief is only $6 per gram and that last a long while. $10 for 3.5 grams flower.

[2025-06-17T01:56:56] Matthew: Oh.
[2025-06-17T01:57:51] Matthew: Well, it keeps me straight. 4yrs away from alcohol and drugs. I have issues. Psychiatrist prefers i smoke than go spend $500 in a weekend on cocaine
[2025-06-17T01:59:30] Matthew: It also helps my chronic pain.... my body is really tore up. Very physically active growing up. Lots of injuries. And the cherry on top was rear ended around 55mph and I was at a dead stop and I flew under the suv in front of me
[2025-06-17T02:08:17] Jose: 500 on cocaine is crazy
[2025-06-17T02:08:43] Jose: In spain that are eaay 10g
[2025-06-17T02:09:12] Jose: Like 0.35oz
[2025-06-17T02:09:30] Rogerio Figueiredo: Any idea why eletric brake ruin the data of the display?
[2025-06-17T02:09:34] Matthew: Dude, im an addict. I'll use 1/8 ounce in an evening
[2025-06-17T02:09:45] Jose: 😧
[2025-06-17T02:09:57] Jose: That is big money
[2025-06-17T02:10:06] Jose: How are the prices on usa
[2025-06-17T02:10:09] Matthew: Yeah, thats why just a puff of weed here and there keeps me good
[2025-06-17T02:10:23] Matthew: $100 for 3.5gram
[2025-06-17T02:10:31] Jose: Cocaine?
[2025-06-17T02:10:36] Matthew: Yeah

[2025-06-17T02:10:43] Jose: Really good price
[2025-06-17T02:10:44] Matthew: Cocaine
[2025-06-17T02:10:51] Jose: 😂😂
[2025-06-17T02:11:04] Matthew: Haha
[2025-06-17T02:11:11] Jose: In spain ot goes between 50-100€ depends of quality
[2025-06-17T02:11:21] Jose: But its not the most common
[2025-06-17T02:11:28] Matthew: So yeah, im addicted to everything, I dont discriminate lol.
[2025-06-17T02:11:35] Jose: Hahaha
[2025-06-17T02:12:18] Matthew: Cocaine turned into a rich person's drug out here. Meth is like $50 for 3.5g
[2025-06-17T02:12:39] Matthew: That's why you see so many zombies talking to people that ain't there
[2025-06-17T02:12:57] Matthew: That mexico crap is i dunno... no comment
[2025-06-17T02:13:01] Matthew: Haha
[2025-06-17T02:14:25] Jose: But is there not base?
[2025-06-17T02:14:39] Matthew: I got scared straight in 2021. I just finished a 90 days rehab. Had a lapse a few weeks later and my heart rate was crazy high. I went to the er and they couldn't stabilize me. My heart rate was ~180bpm
[2025-06-17T02:15:36] Matthew: The best cocaine comes up through mexico. It depends who gets it and what they do with it. So many middleman out there stomping on stuff
[2025-06-17T02:16:12] Matthew: For meth. The world has banned a bunch of chemicals that used to be used. Now they got some other way to make stuff.
[2025-06-17T02:16:50] Jose: Man you need to be exigent with yourself
[2025-06-17T02:16:56] Jose: And get out of all that
[2025-06-17T02:17:13] Jose: Probably you know it but its difficult
[2025-06-17T02:17:21] Jose: But idk
[2025-06-17T02:17:22] Matthew: Im not in it. I've happily been sober 4.5yrs now again
[2025-06-17T02:17:29] Jose: Tjere is no future on druggs
[2025-06-17T02:17:45] Jose: Aaaah ive understood you actually were an addict
[2025-06-17T02:18:14] Matthew: I relapsed when my grandmother passed away in 2019.... was sober 4yrs before that. I spent like 2yrs trying to kill myself. I just can't die
[2025-06-17T02:19:09] Matthew: I couldn't handle my grandmother's passing. Was bad
[2025-06-17T02:19:45] Matthew: A chain of events made her passing even worse for me mentally
[2025-06-17T02:22:15] Matthew: Here she is. Her and my grandfather raised me
[2025-06-17T02:22:53] Matthew: Grandfather was born 1925 and he passed away 2 years ago
[2025-06-17T02:29:56] fry the guy: 😢
[2025-06-17T02:31:14] Matthew: For real?
[2025-06-17T02:31:48] fry the guy: no, i would had shot at em 😅
[2025-06-17T02:54:35] Anthony Meza: How do like makerbase ?? Compared to flipsky I guess it's all I had so far. But I'm learning a ton about order sequence in flashing master/slave and enabling constraints on master and disabling values in slave. It's still a lil confusing but I'm getting it now more than ever that I'm 1.5y clean. Fw and hw and versions. It's a lot. But I fkn love it.
[2025-06-17T02:59:17] Rogerio Figueiredo: For me makerbase ams flipksy is the same
[2025-06-17T03:00:10] Matthew: Go spintend, tronic, ummmm. I dont know
[2025-06-17T03:02:40] Matthew: These guys customer service has been good for their vesc express. @jamessoderstrom they are sending me a free vesc express that they verified for usb-c is functional. I asked if they want the other back so they can repair it and sell it and they said if its working for you consider it a gift

[2025-06-17T12:46:47] Yamal: O really don’t know
[2025-06-17T12:46:55] Yamal: Long time no light

[2025-06-17T12:47:11] Yamal: Free ride
[2025-06-17T12:47:25] Yamal: Let’s see what they say
[2025-06-17T12:47:32] Yamal: 😋
[2025-06-17T12:47:56] Yamal: LETS G000000000 FRANCOIS !!!!!

[2025-06-17T12:48:09] Yamal: ❗️
[2025-06-17T12:48:10] Yamal: ❗️
[2025-06-17T12:48:11] Yamal: ❗️
[2025-06-17T12:48:11] Rose: Slow down with the flooding! Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-06-17T12:59:37] 'lekrsu': They'll surely go to the same 12v buck regardless.
[2025-06-17T13:00:27] 'lekrsu': 30W is quite a lot of draw, can your buck handle that?
[2025-06-17T13:00:34] Pandalgns: @jamaludin_algarnati you love to fuck with Rose 😂😂
[2025-06-17T13:00:52] francois schempers: yeah I think too but better ask since doc is down
[2025-06-17T13:13:59] 'lekrsu': Check continuity of the 12v pins.
[2025-06-17T13:17:29] Yamal: Just kidding ^^’
[2025-06-17T13:17:46] Pandalgns: 😂😂
[2025-06-17T14:41:19] Anthony Meza: on a 20s 😳😲😮
[2025-06-17T14:41:25] Anthony Meza: ?
[2025-06-17T14:45:21] Anthony Meza: <video_file>
[2025-06-17T14:58:22] Yamal: xD, the electronics on top of the water bottles
[2025-06-17T14:59:34] Yamal: your accelerator works?
[2025-06-17T15:03:52] Pandalgns: I didn't understand much 😂😂 This Spaniard doesn't understand spoken English well, but what's your problem? Doesn't the accelerator recognize it?
[2025-06-17T15:05:28] Noname: Mabey when you set up throttle your not saving as "write" in vesc and it resets?
[2025-06-17T15:09:46] Pandalgns: Did you take throttle readings and adjust the maximum and minimum voltage? Did you save the app settings?
[2025-06-17T15:10:50] Matthew: I see the throttle has power to the power button. Take a pic of how you have the throttle wired. Are you being able to map the throttle and see fluctuations when you turn the nob on setup input?
[2025-06-17T15:20:35] Matthew: On the side bar. When in motor configuration. Click read, change value you want. After you change a value you need to hit write for the change to be programmed. The M with an arrow pointing down is the motor configuration write. Bottom right corner will confirm motor configuration or app configuration write successful i do believe are the terms. The letter A with downward arrow is for the app configurations. Same here as with motor configurations click read, change the value and then click the letter A with a downward pointing arrow.
[2025-06-17T15:47:06] Anthony Meza: Yes yes 💪💫🤗🙆🤖 dude I wish I can make a vid and talk but I'm stoned been up all night ..
[2025-06-17T15:53:32] Anthony Meza: That's Gold🥇🥇 I never heard of an XML document until like 3 days ago. When I save them, cus I save like 4-5 of em. They land as web pages. How can I move a laptop copy on mobile . Cus I been doing a hoe lotta work on my laptop . Do you know much about c headers and h headers??? U gta think
[2025-06-17T15:56:32] Anthony Meza: M with the arrow pointing downwards. Got it. What's up with the other 2 next to M⬇️ there's read default and read something else. I stay away from those. They fucked my whole night up.
[2025-06-17T15:59:16] Anthony Meza: Does any body know how to move around the Realtime Data under data analysis ? My charte look like garbage and just want to see an example of what a good wave supposed to look like . I looked it up I guess its like a two spirals with a line going thru it
[2025-06-17T16:04:41] Matthew: Yeah, you need to make sure you click write after the value is changed. Default just let's you know Default. For current settings programmed click read, then change the value then click write. The M is for the motor configurations. When you go to app configuration it is basically same as for motor configurations. You can see value programmed, Default, and write but with the icons with arrow Labeled A downward facing arrow is write.
[2025-06-17T16:07:41] Anthony Meza: Daaam. It's confusing. This is good tho. I'm just tired . I'll re-read it later. Thanks mat
[2025-06-17T16:09:41] Matthew: I dony know what I did when I finally was able to configure my ubox 85250. I configured on the laptop and saved the programming and then I went to go for a ride and got Bluetooth connected to my phone and go and hit the accelerator and I barely started moving when it should have been quite powerful. I check my phone vesc tool display and it doesn't have any of the parameters I set. So I reprogrammed everything on my phone and only thing ive change since that is field weakening on or off with amps value and change motor current to a little less power than I had from 240amps down to 220amps phase and it runs solid and smooth and if I wanna travel longer and faster distances that the vesc and motor doesn't really heat up much. I can go many miles higher speed and be fine
[2025-06-17T16:09:58] Anthony Meza: I do understand it that much more tho thank y'all. So I hit read them change value, hit write and motor or app config...
[2025-06-17T16:10:46] Matthew: Get some rest. I know how that stuff goes. I've done spent countless hours and at times you honestly need to walk away for a day or 2 for mental sanity.
[2025-06-17T16:11:37] Matthew: Correct. So app configuration is the letter "A" and motor configuration is "M".
[2025-06-17T16:14:44] Anthony Meza: Ohh ok . Them Default throw some crazy numbers . Dude I seen my resistance launch up to triple digits . Fawk yea it's scary I had a runaway last night Thank him I put scooter on Jack. Phew. I ran a test and exits app closed USB's heard windows chime and my scooter at full send , 3 inches off the ground yo I think it was 65 battery ampa I tested man Yo that was super scary
[2025-06-17T16:15:18] Anthony Meza: Gotcha 👌
[2025-06-17T16:20:30] Anthony Meza: Question: Are these called signwave (sinewave) or sometign different? I searched the hell outa real-time data waves on vesc_tool and this is the best I found. So I got an idea but one photo does me no good lol #showmeyallsscreensss 😅

[2025-06-17T18:43:30] Matthew: What does it mean. I see 2 torque and two high speed motors
[2025-06-17T18:44:30] Pandalgns: As you can see, xhs lonnyo for speed with the ring separately, xht the same but for torque, mhs lonnyo with the ring together for speed and mht the same but for torque
[2025-06-17T18:47:18] Pandalgns: Whatafak.... a lot of drug addicts addicted to scooters.... 🤔🤔 including me
[2025-06-17T18:47:21] Pandalgns: 😂😂😂
[2025-06-17T18:48:47] Matthew: Life is an interesting thing for sure. I have questions and answers that leads to me being a toddler and my immediate parents doing me a life's disservice. I ended up an addict and in and out of mental institutions, arrested I dont even know how many times. Have internationally od and I just wake up half a day later. Woke up once in a hospital handcuffed to the bed and my father was next to me.. my father lives in a different state. So I wonder if my parents would have taken the Dr's words seriously instead of pretending I didn6 have issues. I graduated from a college but I dropped out of school when I was 16yrs old. So I often wonder
[2025-06-17T18:51:10] Anthony Meza: Idk where ur mind is dude 🚬🥦💨
[2025-06-17T18:52:14] Matthew: Im am sober these days. But addict behavior with some stuff. Scooters and cars lol
[2025-06-17T18:52:45] Matthew: Instant gratification is really bad for the human mind
[2025-06-17T18:55:16] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ring together is pain In my asshoels
[2025-06-17T18:56:22] 'lekrsu': Scooter addiction is quite nice )
[2025-06-17T18:56:28] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Does bro know by any chance length of the axle og those motors ?
[2025-06-17T18:56:57] Pandalgns: Lonnyo?
[2025-06-17T18:57:14] Matthew: I think the worse gotta be that nicer kaabo mantis rim. Them screw are cut to length thats barely long enough to thread into the nuts. I ended up buying c-clamps to compress the rim together so I can get the bolts started.
[2025-06-17T18:57:50] Dualtron Achilleus: 155 or 170 depend version you want

[2025-06-17T19:20:24] Pandalgns: But 155 aperture would only be up to 70h, right? Since the 75h casing itself doesn't allow you to have 155 aperture, I think
[2025-06-17T19:20:46] Pandalgns: You would already move to 175mm aperture, I think.
[2025-06-17T19:22:11] Face de Pin Sucé: Up yo 80H it is 155mm 70H is somewhere around 145mm, don't remember exactly
[2025-06-17T19:22:31] S1m 0n: <photos/photo_24066@17-06-2025_19-22-31.jpg>
[2025-06-17T19:23:12] Pandalgns: 80h with 155mm arm opening and space for the disc and everything??
[2025-06-17T19:26:14] Pandalgns: Are you sure @SibClimb ?? If I remember correctly, the Lonnyo up to 70h have 155mm of opening, 75 and 80 I even think that a little more use 175mm of opening and I repeat if I remember correctly and if I am not mistaken, basically because my Halo fits 70h without modifying the opening of the front shock absorbers but for example 80h as I want to put I have to order in a metal workshop to make me in CNC the supports of the new shock absorbers with more opening
[2025-06-17T19:26:40] Anthony Meza: there it is.. theres a trade off in almost EVERYTHING (i think🤔).. I put a lil thought into it, but it's fukn hard to explain, so I rather not employ myself and lease a 2025 car or live in a gated community in the suburbs.. I did once tho, mom step-dad did there dam best. 200AMPS BRO ?? GOOD GAWD that's a alot
[2025-06-17T19:34:44] Anthony Meza: In my 30's bro. I come to a realization there's far worst shiii 1can partake in life other than a addict. . Were all Addicts in our own little way. addicts, believe it or not u can do ur research , but some of us . Not all, can make the best geniuses dude. #lookitup
[2025-06-17T19:35:33] Anthony Meza: Thx
[2025-06-17T19:37:05] Pandalgns: Brother, I don't consider myself a genius but by investigating and learning on my own I know how to modify, repair and prepare very crazy scooters, surely there are people who know more than me but I consider that I have learned a lot, also in the same way I learned to print in 3d and design my own parts, even if it is in a basic way and I consume every weekend 😂😂😂😂
[2025-06-17T19:37:45] Anthony Meza: Yea they don't mix. I stay in FL . And every towns got bike lanes out here . I love it. I feel so boss wen I pass traffic at 45-50 mph. Respectfully of course .
[2025-06-17T19:39:14] Anthony Meza: Whats that come out to like $7-$800 usd?
[2025-06-17T19:42:58] Face de Pin Sucé: That depends of how is mounted the brake disc, but yes
[2025-06-17T19:51:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I think free shipping
[2025-06-17T20:03:46] 'lekrsu': Here's what you would've seen if you want
[2025-06-17T20:43:55] skrtt: If its 70h with tubeless rim (143mm opening) same for 175mm
[2025-06-17T20:45:57] Justiinx B: With handlebars?
[2025-06-17T20:46:14] Matthew: Had 240amps but it was starting to saturate and just getting way too hot. Turned 220phase. Turned fw down from 80amps to 60 amps. 90amps battery and she's a solid cruiser now
[2025-06-17T20:46:52] Justiinx B: Does someone sell 17×4 65h ly motor?
[2025-06-17T20:48:24] Pandalgns: Yes, 70h 143/145 more or less, 75h 80h.... 170 and washers total 176mm more or less
[2025-06-17T20:48:25] Matthew: I have 65h 17x4
[2025-06-17T20:48:50] Matthew: On 16s
[2025-06-17T20:51:04] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But lonnyo can do 155 I was told
[2025-06-17T20:52:06] L000: Yeah
[2025-06-17T20:52:23] Justiinx B: How much for it
[2025-06-17T20:52:25] Pandalgns: Yes, it depends on the size of the magnet you order, I think it has an opening of 145, 155, and 175.
[2025-06-17T20:52:28] Justiinx B: Is the middle part gone?
[2025-06-17T20:53:35] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Guys, which escs supports 22s? ofc no regen
[2025-06-17T20:56:33] skrtt: C350, g300, tronic, seven etc

[2025-06-17T21:15:15] Yamal: Bigger
[2025-06-17T21:15:35] Pandalgns: 🤔🤔 aren't they figs?
[2025-06-17T21:56:09] haku: the bigfoot. his taint lmao. chode the part inbetween nuts and anus
[2025-06-17T21:57:52] haku: how wide is your custom cnc rim?
[2025-06-17T22:17:33] Face de Pin Sucé: 65mm inside
[2025-06-17T22:18:12] haku: nice
[2025-06-17T22:28:48] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 11inch then
[2025-06-17T22:31:34] haku: yes. im torn between 10 or 11 inch for peak g30v3
[2025-06-17T22:31:37] haku: <video_file>
[2025-06-17T22:32:01] haku: i dont want to gamble and buy parts and its not flush fit.
[2025-06-17T22:32:22] 'lekrsu': MP2 can do 30S with regen
[2025-06-17T22:32:56] 'lekrsu': The newer ubox lite should do 22S without as well.
[2025-06-17T22:38:26] haku: my rim right now is 11. but 70mm
[2025-06-17T22:40:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Then u can fit 7/55/100 like the 90h tires
[2025-06-17T22:41:09] haku: show link

[2025-06-18T00:06:21] haku: no way haha
[2025-06-18T00:06:35] haku: Noname look at this
[2025-06-18T00:07:44] haku: the hide seat is badass
[2025-06-18T00:08:46] Pandalgns: 110/55/6.5
[2025-06-18T00:09:38] haku: i think il be trying the 90/65 of that
[2025-06-18T00:11:16] Pandalgns: Put it on offroad and hit the dirt roads like a real man 😏😏
[2025-06-18T00:11:50] haku: no suspension on peak g30v2. hardtail
[2025-06-18T00:12:19] haku: very stiff. designed for cornering
[2025-06-18T00:13:30] haku: its suppose to be a DOD contract for urban recon vehicle. need agility.
[2025-06-18T00:14:04] haku: also short wheelbase.
[2025-06-18T00:24:08] Pandalgns: Federal Haku.... you are the law now 😂😂
[2025-06-18T00:30:20] cihan: Seems like a really solid mount. I'm satisfied with this design. What's the capacity of this battery?
[2025-06-18T00:31:18] Kafka Luke: It's a g2 with a g2 or g30 battery, they are identic 10s6p
[2025-06-18T00:35:15] 'lekrsu': Very space & weight inefficient 500wh on steering pole.
[2025-06-18T00:36:04] cihan: Having lots of free space inside deck will be really beneficial for me. I think about having a big battery like 18s10p. I'm not sure how that much weight on stem will feel like when riding. Somehow I should add 10kg to the stem and ride that way for a while to see how it feels like.
[2025-06-18T00:36:56] cihan: That's what I'm concerned about. I think it will be better if I can somehow add a rack on top of rear wheel and place the battery there.
[2025-06-18T00:37:24] 'lekrsu': It doesn't. Use a BMS with common charge/discharge.
[2025-06-18T00:38:23] 'lekrsu': JBD/ANT/JK all does unified. So does Ninebot on "discharge" port.
[2025-06-18T00:38:56] 'lekrsu': Charge port? More like all port.
[2025-06-18T00:41:34] cihan: I'll check. I have one big JK BMS already which was too big to fit inside the deck. Do you use one BMS or 2 BMS for each battery connected parallel?
[2025-06-18T00:41:53] 'lekrsu': Always one bms per battery. So two in your case.
[2025-06-18T00:42:31] cihan: Do those BMS communicate with each other or work completely individually?
[2025-06-18T00:42:47] 'lekrsu': Physics takes care of the equalization.
[2025-06-18T00:42:56] 'lekrsu': Just needs to be connected at the same voltage.
[2025-06-18T00:44:32] 'lekrsu': 20S + 20S in parallel means two individual paths of current to discharge from, both working together, optimally never disconnected. 10S + 10S (per example) in series means a not self equalized voltage on both, needing two separate 10S chargers, and your wiring is longer.
[2025-06-18T00:45:59] 'lekrsu': Would only add another battery in series, of equal capacity and current capabilities, if the internal battery is already done and won't be re-done.
[2025-06-18T00:46:36] cihan: Don't you use ideal diode module for parallel batteries?
[2025-06-18T00:46:54] 'lekrsu': You don't need any hardware do put batteries in parallel
[2025-06-18T00:48:27] cihan: By the way I should read the pdf shared here by Francois, there's lots of information there.
[2025-06-18T00:49:19] cihan: But what if when batteries are discharged to different voltage levels? One of them will have higher voltage than the other and the one will higher voltage will start charging the other one.
[2025-06-18T00:49:53] 'lekrsu': It'll charge the other as fast as the resistance of wiring allows and enter short protection. Without a bms it'd be a likely fire risk.
[2025-06-18T00:52:06] cihan: Don't you need to reset BMS when it enters short protection? What happens when this happens during riding?
[2025-06-18T00:52:41] 'lekrsu': Won't ever normally happen unless battery malfunctions if connected initially at the same voltage.
[2025-06-18T00:53:01] 'lekrsu': Most good boards have Bluetooth apps to reset through.
[2025-06-18T00:56:46] cihan: I'm thinking about a scenario like this. Internal battery is 10s4p. And I'll connect an external battery which is 10s10p. External battery will have less resistance and supply more current during high power demand. However when I end climbing a hill and come to flat ground again I'll draw less power and the bigger external battery will probably still have higher voltage than the internal battery. Or voltage drop on the external battery will be low during climbing and external battery will start charging internal battery. Doesn't it ever happen?
[2025-06-18T00:58:04] cihan: On the other hand I don't know if I can completely rely on BMS without any other protection.
[2025-06-18T00:58:40] 'lekrsu': What else would you rely on if not a BMS?
[2025-06-18T00:59:26] 'lekrsu': Fuse is like a BMS but travel back a hundred years of technology advance.
[2025-06-18T01:02:48] cihan: İdeal diode seems like a great protection to me not allowing batteries charge each other. Maybe I can add a fuse too. Is it unnecessary to add another fuse?
[2025-06-18T01:06:07] 'lekrsu': You need them to charge each other to be in parallel. All to have unified ground throughout.
[2025-06-18T01:11:29] haku: https://youtube.com/shorts/kWDVe6ke7Qc?si=tIImdDOXYBeuHpIZ
[2025-06-18T01:11:55] cihan: So do you limit charging current on the BMS? Does BMS allow switching between charging and discharging state fast enough?
[2025-06-18T01:12:20] 'lekrsu': Yes, they do switch between faster than you can fathom. Or one may even just call it simultaneous. You can charge and discharge at the same instance.
[2025-06-18T01:14:20] 'lekrsu': You can't decrease charging current, only out a dead stop max limit and you want the limit to be something you never reach.
[2025-06-18T01:16:33] Crazy scoots: <video_file>
[2025-06-18T01:16:56] 'lekrsu': I'm sure the difference in battery resistance helps to reduce the mismatch draw to some degree.
[2025-06-18T01:17:12] cihan: That's great. I'll also need regen so I need to allow BMS have high enough charge current limit. I think voltage imbalance during ride will be small and will never ever need such high charge current as the regen needs. I think about an alternative for regen braking. I don't want to charge battery with such high current even for short times. Can I add a big power resistor or somehow use the chassis of the scooter as a resistor for regen? What do you think?
[2025-06-18T01:17:55] 'lekrsu': No, no resistors. You set the charging current in your VESC.
[2025-06-18T01:18:06] 'lekrsu': Set 10A and it'll do 10A.
[2025-06-18T01:18:29] cihan: Somehow I'll try to make batteries have similar resistance. External battery will have longer path to the motor so even if the external battery has less resistance inside, cable resistance will add to it.
[2025-06-18T01:20:16] cihan: Is there anyway to monitor and save charge /discharge currents with smart BMS with Bluetooth connection so I can see how things worked and if there was something wrong after a ride?
[2025-06-18T01:20:59] 'lekrsu': Depends on the BMS, JBD has graphs if you stay connected with app open, afaik. Haven't tried it.
[2025-06-18T01:22:09] cihan: OK, I'll check it. Thank you so much for all the answers, it was really enlightening.
[2025-06-18T02:33:53] Anthony Meza: I tried calibratiing and tuning my motors on a flispy using vesc_tool6.5 Almost had success. Well I did actually. In fact, I successfully tuned the master with vesctool last night using openai / 4.omini , they feel I'm pretty advanced these days than traditional trade schools. I didn't know you couldn't just swap out bolt on motors, check tire pressure & ride out. Nope NEVER EVER SWAP YOUR MOTORS OUT FROM ONE VEHICLE TO ANOTHR half way through configs TIMING, RESISTANCE THAT UPSIDE DOWN X 'Y' THING. YOURE NIGHT RIDES PRETTY MUCH WONT BE THE SAME. SO CAN SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME WHATS GOING ON INSIDE THOSE MOTORS EXACTLY? & THEY STILL WORK. THEY RUN. HIT 56MPH A FEW HRS AGO BUT ITS THE START THATS ROUGH and loud. AND ONCE I GET UP TO 3RD MODE, SINGLE MOTOR, IT GETS SOFTER AND MORE RESPONSIVE . WHEN I SLOW DOWN IT GETs pulsive and ROUGH. What could this be I HOPE THEY'RE NOT DEAD. 🙏 ANY JABS ANYBODY.
[2025-06-18T02:52:21] Noname: Mabey to much phase current. Thats your start power.
[2025-06-18T02:54:21] Noname: Just need to bolt on rack and tail lights when paint dries and the swingarm covers but so close to done
[2025-06-18T02:54:36] Noname: Night adventures also
[2025-06-18T02:54:51] haku: you need to mount the qs thats what you need to do

[2025-06-18T02:56:17] Noname: It'll put the jetson in the gulag
[2025-06-18T02:56:46] haku: wait till i get proper motors for jetson
[2025-06-18T02:57:05] Noname: Enhancing isn't a fair fight
[2025-06-18T02:57:05] Kafka Luke: I just liked the idea and how it looks they are cheap and water resistant Or just a nice add on to the rebuilt one that is inside
[2025-06-18T02:57:07] haku: all funding relocated to peak g30v3 though
[2025-06-18T02:59:13] Noname: Oh forgot gotta print ebike plate
[2025-06-18T02:59:15] haku: i just had a genius idea. maybe a printed spacer on the jetson case would be nice. fit more cells
[2025-06-18T02:59:47] haku: since i know a bit of cad. just need to figure out angles and stuff
[2025-06-18T03:00:19] Noname: Why isn't the penis big enough
[2025-06-18T03:00:30] Noname: It's 3p?
[2025-06-18T03:00:37] haku: no. need push more amps.
[2025-06-18T03:00:47] haku: for future bigger motor
[2025-06-18T03:01:33] haku: but thats just an idea right now. focused on future peak g30 itterations

[2025-06-19T09:17:58] Yamal: The truth is that in my free time I can't stop thinking about escaping on the e-scooter and enjoying the scenery, it's my best personal leisure activity.
[2025-06-19T09:19:32] Yamal: Because as you know, everyone needs some time for themselves every day, time to reflect, escape, or whatever you want to call it, and I spend it either in a park doing bars or on the e-scooter.

[2025-06-19T12:17:00] Lisa: 22x3 60H with PMT 10x3 Tires – €200 I’m selling my motor, which is capable of speeds over 100 km/h, depending on setup and rider weight. I personally reached 81 km/h (speedometer reading, not GPS) using a 20S battery at 80 A. The motor has a medium KV, right between typical setups like 16x4 and 33x2 – a great balanced option. It is labeled as “250 W” to avoid any legal issues (drive safely and avoid public roads). Included are PMT 10x3 tires mounted on 22x3 60H Please write pm if any questions

[2025-06-19T23:41:53] Lisa: from paolo wo back in the times
[2025-06-19T23:42:00] haku: i see
[2025-06-19T23:42:19] haku: phoebeliu is LY sister company i thinks
[2025-06-19T23:42:30] Lisa: yes he said it sometime
[2025-06-19T23:42:51] haku: phase cables cut short om these?

[2025-06-19T23:45:39] haku: i see.
[2025-06-19T23:45:46] haku: how short is it?
[2025-06-19T23:47:29] Lisa: penis short
[2025-06-19T23:47:37] Lisa: career short
[2025-06-19T23:47:55] Lisa: money short
[2025-06-19T23:48:05] Lisa: future short
[2025-06-19T23:52:24] haku: dam my kind of short
[2025-06-19T23:54:28] haku: just dont short palantir. you will loose
[2025-06-20T00:03:59] haku: this is a legit question btw. i want to build on a 22x3
[2025-06-20T00:24:59] Lisa: idk you can have long or short cables
[2025-06-20T00:48:50] cihan: I would like to have opinions on a parallel battery design. Internal battery will be at C capacity. External battery will be at 2C capacity, voltages will be same when connecting them if it matters . I'll disable charging of internal battery at BMS and optionally add an ideal diode to output of internal battery to prevent back flow. I'll enable charging on external battery for regen so regen current will flow completely to external battery. External battery will always have higher current than the internal battery and internal battery will never be able to charge external battery. Could there be any problems during ride? Will this make riding jerky since internal battery will start supplying current suddenly when external battery voltage drops to the same level of internal battery?
[2025-06-20T01:01:35] Noname: Just connect them it doesn't matter if they're the same voltage. I have 2 16p connected with a 3p
[2025-06-20T01:14:11] Jose: Yes

[2025-06-20T01:23:13] skrtt: My personal record. 6 1/2 min to change tubed tire
[2025-06-20T01:32:15] haku: james ai since your here would 12v tailights and brake lights work with spinny and adc v2?
[2025-06-20T02:12:54] cihan: Thanks, what if I add an ideal diode to the internal battery output? Won't it completely disable regen charging? Would it still cause problems with internal battery BMS?
[2025-06-20T02:29:05] cihan: What I want is somehow not allow parallel batteries charge each other while keeping the regen current higher than the max regen current small internal battery can accept. I want this not to lose power unnecessarily and not let the batteries heat up unnecessarily.
[2025-06-20T02:32:50] Anthony Meza: Measured from center hole to center hole. Who needs em
[2025-06-20T04:07:17] Noname: Regen is phase amps? You'll probably heat the controller faster than a battery.
[2025-06-20T04:10:10] Noname: They sometimes balance each other with mabey 1 amp for a few seconds untill they level out. The excess power on regen will be split between the two more on the bigger batt and also power output. So for regen just don't go over the sum of the two batterys.
[2025-06-20T04:12:15] Noname: Did some range testing today
[2025-06-20T04:13:21] Noname: Was out till I saw zombies. 38miles 13v used probably gonna need the 2nd battery for my trip this thing sucks to pedal 😆
[2025-06-20T04:13:44] Noname: FYI that's a different pond
[2025-06-20T04:16:46] Noname: I tried a diode pairing a 17s and 16s battery. I had some weird throttle cuts so I just charged the 17 short or ran it down before connecting.
[2025-06-20T04:19:43] haku: those baskets custom mounting?
[2025-06-20T04:20:21] Noname: Front came with it. Rear had a 2up seat I just welded a plate and bolted an Ali rack on it
[2025-06-20T04:22:49] haku: jank but clean
[2025-06-20T04:23:48] Noname: I'm so bad with tires was at 20psi lol

[2025-06-20T06:05:51] Yamal: Nice also can get more top speed
[2025-06-20T06:05:52] haku: what other choices?
[2025-06-20T06:06:19] Yamal: Best choice
[2025-06-20T06:06:29] Yamal: 11”?
[2025-06-20T06:06:29] haku: i just want whiter smoke you feel me dawgs
[2025-06-20T06:06:53] haku: no idea yet. are you telling weped my secrets.
[2025-06-20T06:07:09] haku: you better not yamal. they always try to copy.me
[2025-06-20T06:07:53] Noname: Shut off rear motor then
[2025-06-20T06:09:26] haku: this little shit already isnfast enough. why crave more fuck me
[2025-06-20T06:10:06] haku: so dangerous. short wheelbase. meant for cornering and skateparks not speed
[2025-06-20T06:47:38] Yamal: <photos/photo_24135@20-06-2025_06-47-38.jpg>
[2025-06-20T06:49:29] Yamal: Those kilowatts are more in line with the battery discharge I have ❤️‍🔥
[2025-06-20T07:10:30] haku: boys is it possible to powdercoat a motor casing? or the oven will cook the magnets? https://youtu.be/mjyMxPn4sWo?si=QW9upKnObYnxMgvA
[2025-06-20T07:33:54] Anthony Meza: This is probably why I was getting some noise when I turned my throttle on. Time to look into shielding wire and how they really work.
[2025-06-20T07:37:03] Arnau Martinez Casals: I don’t know how this guy measured his one 🤣🤷🏻‍♂️
[2025-06-20T07:37:21] Arnau Martinez Casals: 🤨
[2025-06-20T07:38:37] Arnau Martinez Casals: Yes is good
[2025-06-20T07:38:50] Arnau Martinez Casals: Its 50h 17x4
[2025-06-20T08:42:24] S1m 0n: Hey, what are the different backup functions in the Vesc tool for? Is there a difference in the settings saved if I choose XML or c? And what's the deal with the UUID backup? This backup only works with the ESC key... but it's stored internally somewhere in the Vesc tool, so it's not a file that can be backed up externally?
[2025-06-20T09:30:32] S1m 0n: Just Check with Multimeter Output of Throttle .. 3Pins.. 3,3/5V, GND & Output. Output should Not Higher than 3,3V.. 3,5V is max ADC reading of Vesc, but risky to damage something in the Future
[2025-06-20T10:44:53] Rogerio Figueiredo: My Victor has not hm and is 50mm
[2025-06-20T10:45:22] Rogerio Figueiredo: Lol
[2025-06-20T10:45:28] Rogerio Figueiredo: U want a video?
[2025-06-20T10:45:46] Rogerio Figueiredo: I cns open the motor again measure again and show you a video
[2025-06-20T10:45:59] Rogerio Figueiredo: You know how many versions of Victor there is?
[2025-06-20T10:46:12] Arnau Martinez Casals: With vernier
[2025-06-20T10:46:31] Rogerio Figueiredo: <photos/photo_24137@20-06-2025_10-46-31.jpg>
[2025-06-20T10:46:47] Rogerio Figueiredo: My Victor used normal disc brakes
[2025-06-20T10:46:55] Arnau Martinez Casals: Motors are same hahahahaha
[2025-06-20T10:47:03] Rogerio Figueiredo: Lol
[2025-06-20T10:47:08] Rogerio Figueiredo: So if you say so
[2025-06-20T10:47:10] Rogerio Figueiredo: Lol
[2025-06-20T10:47:18] Arnau Martinez Casals: And yours are the old ones
[2025-06-20T10:47:22] Arnau Martinez Casals: Not the new ones
[2025-06-20T10:47:26] Arnau Martinez Casals: 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2025-06-20T10:47:31] Rogerio Figueiredo: My friend has a victor thsy used dualtron disc's
[2025-06-20T10:47:42] Rogerio Figueiredo: Mine used normal discs
[2025-06-20T10:47:51] Rogerio Figueiredo: I don't open his
[2025-06-20T10:48:00] Rogerio Figueiredo: But I can guarantee you
[2025-06-20T10:48:05] Arnau Martinez Casals: Lol
[2025-06-20T10:48:05] Rogerio Figueiredo: That is 50mm
[2025-06-20T10:48:19] Rogerio Figueiredo: If you wanna bet a made a video
[2025-06-20T10:48:19] Arnau Martinez Casals: Only motors with different size of disc is thunder
[2025-06-20T10:48:26] Arnau Martinez Casals: Sure
[2025-06-20T10:48:41] Rogerio Figueiredo: So what you wanna bet
[2025-06-20T10:48:56] Arnau Martinez Casals: I bet a 50h
[2025-06-20T10:49:06] Arnau Martinez Casals: So if it isnt you have to buy me one
[2025-06-20T10:49:16] Arnau Martinez Casals: If it is i send you one
[2025-06-20T10:49:22] Arnau Martinez Casals: I hace torque and speed

[2025-06-20T10:50:36] Arnau Martinez Casals: 17x4 Or 21x3 what you prefer
[2025-06-20T10:51:14] Rogerio Figueiredo: Ok then
[2025-06-20T10:51:29] Rogerio Figueiredo: Monday I open it
[2025-06-20T10:51:53] Rogerio Figueiredo: I'm not with scooter now
[2025-06-20T10:54:17] Arnau Martinez Casals: I have 2 DT Spider 2 motors. One with broken axle other with bad nutt. 100€ twice
[2025-06-20T10:54:28] Arnau Martinez Casals: <photos/photo_24140@20-06-2025_10-54-28.jpg>
[2025-06-20T10:54:55] Arnau Martinez Casals: This is nutt bad other is axle broken. Stator is ok
[2025-06-20T10:55:20] Arnau Martinez Casals: For someone Who has a Burned spider one…
[2025-06-20T10:56:20] Rogerio Figueiredo: Im waiting to my 20s7p molicel battery for the Victor
[2025-06-20T10:57:03] Rogerio Figueiredo: To see how the motors do because I have 2 vsett 10 motors that I can use instead
[2025-06-20T11:01:10] Arnau Martinez Casals: Its different, if you ride stock controller is better victor ones
[2025-06-20T11:03:20] Arnau Martinez Casals: If you riding vesc Better vsett 10, bigger magnet and widing, victor is 45h but winding is intermedium/speed, vset is more torque. Victor has more RPM
[2025-06-20T11:16:06] cihan: Thanks, I don't know what regen current I'll have in phase amps but 2000W regen power will be enough for me. I'll adjust regen once I build and measure resistance of batteries including cable resistance. 15A regen current never caused controller heat problem before when riding at 32 km/h. However it could be problem at higher speeds.
[2025-06-20T11:22:57] cihan: I wanted to mean ideal diode module. It has like 50 miliohm resistance when forward biased and won't consume more than 10W for me. What I wonder is blocking charge current this way will harm BMS or not. I don't think it would because external battery will take regen current without letting voltage increase on internal BMS. But not sure
[2025-06-20T11:34:25] Rogerio Figueiredo: I have 75200 makerbase
[2025-06-20T12:03:41] Rogerio Figueiredo: If Victor is more rpm with vesc will be better no?
[2025-06-20T12:04:07] Rogerio Figueiredo: I just need fast 100kmh
[2025-06-20T12:43:11] Rogerio Figueiredo: Can I use this washer to put vsett motor on dualtron Victor? I just found this on AliExpress: 7,26€ | Nut washer of MINIMOTORS DUALTRON THUNDER THUNDER II STORM ACHILLEUS MINI electric scooter epassion https://a.aliexpress.com/_EHxCZHk
[2025-06-20T12:43:51] Jose: 3: Victor (30A) Victor luxury (32A) Victor luxury plus (35A)
[2025-06-20T12:49:15] Rogerio Figueiredo: That's the controllers
[2025-06-20T12:56:03] Arnau Martinez Casals: Is more rpm cause but less torque 🤷🏻‍♂️
[2025-06-20T12:56:29] Rogerio Figueiredo: But the winding is different
[2025-06-20T12:56:41] Rogerio Figueiredo: More rpm means more speed right?
[2025-06-20T13:00:28] Arnau Martinez Casals: Its almost the same
[2025-06-20T13:02:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: With 75200 what motor you thinks is best for reach 100/110 kmh?
[2025-06-20T13:05:06] Arnau Martinez Casals: You wont reach that speed with any of these 2 motors at 72v
[2025-06-20T13:09:41] Arnau Martinez Casals: 95-100 probably
[2025-06-20T13:33:57] Jose: With a q5evo wich is 50h im prety sure you can
[2025-06-20T13:34:21] Jose: That motor reaches +100kmh withouth wheight
[2025-06-20T13:34:32] Jose: At 52v with original electronic
[2025-06-20T13:40:11] Arnau Martinez Casals: 🤣🤣🤣
[2025-06-20T13:41:34] Arnau Martinez Casals: Mine on vesc at 72v spinning 104/105 freewheel and you reach 100 at 52v with original electronic
[2025-06-20T13:42:35] Arnau Martinez Casals: Please stop liyng about speeds, thanks
[2025-06-20T13:43:21] Arnau Martinez Casals: At 72v its posible reach 100kmh with victor vsett10 Or iceq5 Evolution
[2025-06-20T13:43:22] Yamal: Stop police
[2025-06-20T13:43:26] Yamal: ^^
[2025-06-20T13:43:45] Arnau Martinez Casals: 110 absolute no
[2025-06-20T14:49:17] cihan: Thanks
[2025-06-20T15:30:21] Rose: Hey there Pasdebrrr, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-06-20T15:31:39] 'lekrsu': Oh hey, welcome!
[2025-06-20T15:52:36] skrtt: Luxury plus is 32A
[2025-06-20T15:52:45] skrtt: Not 35
[2025-06-20T15:57:10] Unknown: phases also dont look good lol

[2025-06-20T16:39:37] Nobrrr: Hello guys has anyone tried huashou hsp0076a on mp2 vesc?
[2025-06-20T17:30:09] Jose: Then what is the diference between luxury and luxury+
[2025-06-20T17:31:39] skrtt: Luxury have 30A luxury plus have 32. Luxury plus have blinkers, horn, light and bigger deck
[2025-06-20T18:10:54] Jose: A friend of mine has luxury and 32A
[2025-06-20T18:10:58] Jose: Why
[2025-06-20T18:15:27] skrtt: Maybe changed controllers
[2025-06-20T19:07:45] Anthony Meza: I wonder if this is the universal sequence in hall sensor wires to controllers. 🤔 Because I labeled every wire, I jus reverted back to China esc's to catch the right order sequence using phase high low energy/logic state there in and which one fires first. Man that diagnostic was nuts. I had .3v readings on everything ...shorting the shit outta shit catching errors E o7's . My display screen kept turning off every 20 min. But shes ready now. ⚠️ Hall FOC Detection Error Recieved alert ⚠️ 🙈🙉🙊
[2025-06-20T19:12:22] Paolo ⁭: Hall phases has no order with vesc since is auto detected
[2025-06-20T19:12:46] Paolo ⁭: Probabile your halls are gone
[2025-06-20T19:15:39] Anthony Meza: <photos/photo_24142@20-06-2025_19-15-39.jpg>
[2025-06-20T19:15:48] Paolo ⁭: I have vesc with hsp0076a but not on mp2
[2025-06-20T19:17:36] Paolo ⁭: What happened? Why selling

[2025-06-20T22:13:32] Matthew: Youre giving this hall sensor stuff way too much thought at this point. Contact the company you bought the motors from and have them replace them or just run sensorless
[2025-06-20T22:15:06] Yamal: Is just kidding
[2025-06-20T22:15:11] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-06-20T22:15:23] Yamal: This with Nami perfect combination
[2025-06-20T22:26:08] haku: you need atheletes yamal. not aesthetics only

[2025-06-20T22:59:00] haku: whats the difference between 90/65/6.5 and 90/60/6.5. is it less wider?
[2025-06-20T23:00:14] Apo: nah
[2025-06-20T23:00:19] Apo: 90 is the width
[2025-06-20T23:00:25] haku: i see
[2025-06-20T23:00:29] Apo: 60 is the height of the sidewall
[2025-06-20T23:00:36] haku: gotcha
[2025-06-20T23:00:39] Apo: so the 65 is slightly higher
[2025-06-20T23:00:44] haku: i see
[2025-06-20T23:01:29] Apo: better explanation from google AI XD but thats stuff i knew already myself

[2025-06-20T23:26:16] Anthony Meza: <video_file>
[2025-06-20T23:26:41] haku: scooters getting bigger while bikes smaller. it will meet in the middle like i said back then.
[2025-06-20T23:27:21] Apo: id prefer if scooter would be build in such a way that we can easily use bike parts such as suspension and brakes without issues
[2025-06-20T23:27:22] Anthony Meza: Thats what I did. I switch over to bldc. I was on foc thos whole time gettong that hall foc error
[2025-06-20T23:27:40] haku: this guy stealing my swag boys. https://youtube.com/shorts/MXIf9nkeOyE?si=4r-yleo8OvoTTk5p
[2025-06-20T23:27:43] Apo: as things are atm its a hassle to put on proper brakes/suspension from good brands such as FOX / Rockshox etc.
[2025-06-20T23:28:22] haku: UK is competing with haku industries worldwide

[2025-06-20T23:41:39] haku: you can throw it over a fence. its light af.
[2025-06-20T23:43:57] Noname: We only have stone walls and a fence might have farm animals on the other side so not worth jumping
[2025-06-20T23:44:54] haku: remember i built mine for recon missions under DOD strict contracts. it needs to be easily concealed
[2025-06-20T23:50:54] Noname: There's a wildcat for 50$ but kinda far away
[2025-06-20T23:53:52] Noname: @Bradhaku do that youtube thing where you drive through the hood and look for hookers and see if you get chased out
[2025-06-20T23:55:04] haku: thats the plan
[2025-06-20T23:55:29] haku: i wonder if alibaba has these frames for bulk order
[2025-06-20T23:55:41] haku: no paint just bare steel
[2025-06-20T23:56:24] Matthew: Sounds good. Maybe bug the company you purchased the motors from and maybe they will give you credit for another purchase or something.
[2025-06-20T23:57:13] haku: american made okay. but need china for now
[2025-06-21T00:02:16] Anthony Meza: Yea I emailed them but I don't think it's going any where. Honestly I think I probly messed up a phase wire.

[2025-06-21T00:03:14] Yamal: China lover

[2025-06-21T03:08:18] Matthew: A baby is growing haha
[2025-06-21T03:08:48] Matthew: This turned red throughout today, was all green this morning
[2025-06-21T03:09:09] Matthew: Snap peas 🫛
[2025-06-21T03:18:04] Noname: Felt a lil weird but legal riding today. Thought I was getting pulled over first 5 min dude whipped around then ended up passing me when I pulled over. That particular town has asshole cops
[2025-06-21T04:51:27] skrtt: What happend??
[2025-06-21T04:51:55] Noname: Ran red light
[2025-06-21T04:52:10] skrtt: He or the other mf?
[2025-06-21T04:52:16] Noname: Other
[2025-06-21T04:52:20] skrtt: Ffs
[2025-06-21T04:52:32] skrtt: Hope haku got a good insurance
[2025-06-21T04:52:47] Noname: Doesn't matter other is at fault
[2025-06-21T04:53:14] skrtt: I see
[2025-06-21T04:53:43] Noname: You just need to have insurance and be inspected. Otherwise you shouldn't have been there and now it's your fault
[2025-06-21T04:54:46] Noname: Plus he went to hospital. Always go so you can add to severity of accident and any problems later on
[2025-06-21T04:57:36] skrtt: But is he ok?
[2025-06-21T04:58:05] Noname: Believe so but they might do gender reassignment to be sure
[2025-06-21T04:58:54] Matthew: Yes, normally the accident is just the start of problems. I should have gone to the hospital for my wreck.
[2025-06-21T04:59:57] Noname: Yeah but you generally get screwed unless it's a loss of limb or something
[2025-06-21T05:00:31] skrtt: @Bradhaku tell us if ur good
[2025-06-21T05:02:03] Matthew: Yeah, but at least the lawyers have more to work with. Im fucked from my wreck. Fought for 3yrs to get a settlement. I got $10k... yes, im fucked for life and all I was compensated is moving into an apartment
[2025-06-21T05:03:05] skrtt: I need this month to end
[2025-06-21T05:03:34] Matthew: The other thing was I was gonna go after the family because it was a minor who ran into me. The lawyer said they will just claim bankruptcy and it will cost me money
[2025-06-21T05:06:29] Noname: Yeah even fender benders suck. I gave a guy to opportunity to pay cash for a new bumper when his kid hit me. He was like I know your just gonna jeep the money. Yeah no shit but you damaged my property. Shortly after my gas tank started leaking. Can't win
[2025-06-21T05:10:48] Noname: @Bradhaku did they find residual vesc penis radiation? Still a boy?
[2025-06-21T05:15:42] skrtt: Maybe they realized something was wrong with him and now he is in the psychiatric ward full of antidepressants whispering “i need burnouts”
[2025-06-21T05:16:15] Noname: I'm not a doctor and I could tell you he ain't right
[2025-06-21T05:17:21] Noname: Depends on the severity of the head trauma could go.either way Mabey he got reset idk

[2025-06-21T05:29:19] Noname: I believe he's homo-fabric now?
[2025-06-21T05:29:38] skrtt: Nice
[2025-06-21T05:29:51] Noname: Not as nice as that dress he made
[2025-06-21T05:30:29] Noname: He's gonna wake up to 100 ball busting messages tmrw but he's annoying so whatever

[2025-06-21T09:16:18] Anthony Meza: I tried using ChatGPT on vesc . It helps a little. Ive learned a ton. But I feed it a ton of info and that causes it to start mixing up prompts forgetting goals and making shit up.

[2025-06-21T15:25:34] cihan: Did anyone measure how long it takes to stop from 60 km/h to full stop with emergency brake without risking face plant? İ wonder how much regen I need and how much can controller handle. Will 30A regen current be too much for controller for 3 seconds? I mean 30A battery current to 60V battery.

[2025-06-22T04:47:43] Matthew: Would converting to vesc on a dual motor scooter, which is best to get for the most user-friendly integration for horns, lights, signals, ect. The ubox 85150 units or the dual 75100v2.1 ubox? Will be running on 60v 90amps battery. Dual 3kw motors.
[2025-06-22T04:48:27] Matthew: This or 2 of the 85150 units with which accessories?
[2025-06-22T04:49:06] Matthew: Trying to go as plug and play as possible
[2025-06-22T05:01:07] haku: get 2 85/150
[2025-06-22T05:01:23] haku: never duals because if one side breaks your fucked
[2025-06-22T05:01:27] Noname: Matthew you just posted wanting a 20s battery
[2025-06-22T05:01:45] Noname: Also fitment you can move 2 around

[2025-06-22T05:04:20] Matthew: I still want a 20s battery. Someone is modifying his yume raptor and hes wondering to go for the dual unit or 2 go with 85150 units. He's not wondering much past that.
[2025-06-22T05:06:17] Noname: Gonna get about 6kw out of 90a60v
[2025-06-22T05:56:22] Matthew: Yeah, hes just looking for better acceleration and use of some field weakening
[2025-06-22T05:57:39] Matthew: Yume imo builds good scooters but they're a cookie cutter scooter without some nice refinements in control
[2025-06-22T05:58:57] Matthew: The y11 i have is basically the same. When I ran dual 85150 on vsett motors on my g30lp it made my factory y11 weak af
[2025-06-22T06:01:43] haku: yume/ laotie ti 30 is easy to build. generic frames. lots of parts available
[2025-06-22T06:03:08] haku: might need a spacer to fit vesc inside though if you want max battery space 20s 10p 21700

[2025-06-22T07:02:03] haku: @Un_Jason while im in recovery. guide me through this buddy.
[2025-06-22T07:02:42] haku: if die on peak g30 for real. its your fault
[2025-06-22T07:22:31] skrtt: What is needed to make a 66x1 motor run?
[2025-06-22T07:26:02] skrtt: Compared to “normal” windings

[2025-06-22T08:51:51] A.P: Hello
[2025-06-22T08:52:25] A.P: Is this the parameter to change the acceleration?
[2025-06-22T09:26:19] haku: not the same? shit balls.

[2025-06-22T15:24:02] Rose: Hey there Dariusz, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-06-22T15:25:30] haku: will this work? do i need a different one?
[2025-06-22T15:26:20] Anthony Meza: Well, I learned last night what pull up and pull down resisters are, learned the hard way.
[2025-06-22T15:28:07] Anthony Meza: Hell yea looks super nice so far man. Are you building electric scoot??
[2025-06-22T15:37:11] Anthony Meza: Do these model use a fw called 75_300_r1 and r2 for vesc_tool_6.05
[2025-06-22T15:37:45] Anthony Meza: WhTs this ???
[2025-06-22T15:38:34] Anthony Meza: Faaaawk that looks a lil sus broskie
[2025-06-22T15:42:59] Anthony Meza: Positive Ramping Time in vesc_tool is the amount of time it takes to smoothly transition from zero throttle to full throttle. It acts like a filter on your throttle input, preventing sudden jumps and delivering a gradual increase in motor power. .30 seems to give you a snappy lil pull. What version are you on?
[2025-06-22T15:45:43] Anthony Meza: Yea dont worry about c or h . That's next level shiiit Use motor and app config xml. Ok you'll be saving and clicking in and out I think 4 times. 2 for master and 2 for slave. Each of 2 are for motor and app config.
[2025-06-22T15:46:48] Anthony Meza: How do u like ur ubox. I'm browsing for another one I shorted my flipsky.
[2025-06-22T15:53:21] Anthony Meza: Also I think what your trying to look for is not available. The speed is not controlled the speed is a result of parameters you set. I say if you want to tinker with Motor Settings for power limits & speed. Then hit App Settings for throttle/switches profiles and such to control that power. Hope that helps a.p
[2025-06-22T15:54:02] haku: esp32 according to ali
[2025-06-22T15:55:36] Anthony Meza: Did you find out if you can combine these two.? I think u can . But you'd need a multimeter to check . Bit how would you do it tho.
[2025-06-22T16:05:09] Anthony Meza: MY TIP OF THE WEEK : I made I rookie mistake guys. I shorted my vesc (or esc I should technically call it) and I can only think of 2 possible scenarios that may have caused this. 1) ALWAYS, ALWAYS , ALL- WAYS CHECK WHAT SETTING YOURE ON before probing. a) VOLTAGE b) OHM c) CONTINUITY d) AC/DC e) RESISTANCE thank the man up there I'm still here 🙏
[2025-06-22T16:06:54] Anthony Meza: I think my duty % may be to high here who agrees? Or is it user based values case by case?
[2025-06-22T16:09:32] Anthony Meza: I've been learning those. I couldn't recognize it. Why? I don't think these are original 🤔 but still effective I believe. Are these difficult to work with?
[2025-06-22T16:10:24] haku: tbh. this my first time getting one
[2025-06-22T16:10:46] Anthony Meza: Esp32 vs ardiuno I'd chose esp32! I know that much . My use case is fan control at certian temperature activate automatically
[2025-06-22T16:11:28] Anthony Meza: Hell yea bro git it . Have fun but be safe. What are your plans
[2025-06-22T16:12:00] Anthony Meza: Where do u live???
[2025-06-22T16:12:27] Anthony Meza: Uh oh, somebody got that message 😳
[2025-06-22T16:13:17] Anthony Meza: An IED lmao 🤣 jk jk

[2025-06-22T16:21:20] Anthony Meza: Time to loan-pawn the laptop since my controller died. I need food now. 😩
[2025-06-22T16:24:41] haku: they say you can make a vesc display out of these
[2025-06-22T16:24:46] Anthony Meza: Dude don't listen to them 😒. Use of eps32's (based on my research and understanding) are used EVERYWHERE!
[2025-06-22T16:26:15] Anthony Meza: Yea man you can throw sound too. A lil 'beep beep beep' when u put the key in, like a regular car does. Faawk yea! 💪
[2025-06-22T16:27:37] Anthony Meza: I blew my master side last night
[2025-06-22T16:29:15] Anthony Meza: Ooowie. Yikes . What happened Mind me asking .. .
[2025-06-22T16:31:15] Anthony Meza: I was in the mix of 2 different jobs checking for connection and then checking how much of it. And didn't turn dial. 🫣🤦 💥
[2025-06-22T16:37:29] Anthony Meza: Have you tested 100a???
[2025-06-22T16:38:04] Anthony Meza: Ok.. thx
[2025-06-22T16:40:35] Anthony Meza: Shheeei I need to get out of xt60 world and upgrade xt90 for battery at lease or AS150's for phases I think are better. For phases these 12awg are weak
[2025-06-22T16:41:08] Anthony Meza: <photos/photo_24170@22-06-2025_16-41-08.jpg>
[2025-06-22T16:50:38] cihan: Yes, you can do it for sure and it's going to be useful. I don't know why but VESC enthusiasts don't like active cooling. :)
[2025-06-22T17:08:03] Anthony Meza: This is my ride. I'm farely new here and looking fwd to learn more about yalls builds and setups. I own a K-Cloud k14, super slow in stock form . So I'm rebuilding it to bring me joy my way. Enjoy yall ! Stay vigilant out there.
[2025-06-22T17:08:31] Anthony Meza: Ok thx jppl
[2025-06-22T17:09:11] Anthony Meza: How u like tc
[2025-06-22T17:09:40] Happy Giraffe: If you are not super tight on space, definitely get QS-8 as it has more robust resistor for the antispark feature. If you have 60v->
[2025-06-22T17:09:54] Anthony Meza: U own one of these vesc's in dual?? O no
[2025-06-22T17:11:25] Anthony Meza: Man I wish I new how to manuever github. Then I can say "mom I made it" formal foreal..
[2025-06-22T17:16:22] Anthony Meza: I got <84v bro I should been upgraded already. That's probably the problem why my halls don't work any more. My wires are stock 12awg too. I'm just scared to do the upgrade . Feels like something always goes wrong. So i slowed down and studied up. Now I'm in full learning mode. Thanks H.G I'll look em up
[2025-06-22T17:16:57] Smart Repair: Salt water from the street
[2025-06-22T17:20:01] Anthony Meza: That's like saying ," I do construction work in 90° F heat and i hate air conditioning 😑 " Well buddy then fry away homie, fry away. It only makes sense if u got half a brain lol

[2025-06-22T17:23:30] Jason: yes
[2025-06-22T17:23:32] Jason: works
[2025-06-22T17:23:50] Jason: arduino is merely a name of the platform
[2025-06-22T17:24:32] Happy Giraffe: If halls dont work usually its loose sensor from vibration, not fully plugged cable to vesc or broken wire as they are quite thin.
[2025-06-22T17:24:44] Yamal: Today Sunday yes hehe
[2025-06-22T17:24:58] Yamal: How your scooter going
[2025-06-22T17:25:05] Happy Giraffe: But sensorless is very good on vesc, no need for the halls imo
[2025-06-22T17:25:29] Yamal: Has he come out of the operating room yet?
[2025-06-22T17:26:31] Anthony Meza: Yea and the way I had it to be able to tap in and probe to get reading was causing brownouts. I gotta be more careful for sure. 😬
[2025-06-22T17:28:56] Anthony Meza: I heard. I'm kinda understand vesc tool and the order it needs to go to achieve other methods. I'm trying to figure out the difference with setting BLDC > DC > FOC > (and there's one last option I forgot) but I been on foc all along with errors and when I switch over to bldc, Maan that roar I got was something special
[2025-06-22T17:30:50] Anthony Meza: When I run sensorless, that next sensors tab is still open with 0.001 values . They stay at that level sensory is unavailable. Is that true? Wish they can just remove the "sensors" tab so user don't feel they need to fill that part out.
[2025-06-22T17:31:48] Anthony Meza: Ahh ok 👍
[2025-06-22T17:33:47] Anthony Meza: It's at the doctor's office right now getting brain work done. Haha I bought a k14 k-cloud. stock is soo nice. And it wasn't max potential. My project I love it. And yours ? What are you working on?
[2025-06-22T17:39:18] Chen Simhony: How it happened?
[2025-06-22T17:43:37] Yamal: I'm not working on anything right now. I'd love to start with the Ninebot G2 Max project, but I can't yet. So now I'm just planning routes to go to and I have a pending account on the highway with my e-scooter
[2025-06-22T18:04:02] Anthony Meza: the hall wires shorted on master when plugged into comm master I got weird values. Diagnose comm port master 5v rail the wrong way and blew entire master 💥 .because slave/mstr are isolated i turned slave to master and thought nothing of the halls being an issue so swapped jst connect pin over to slave side and the same thing happened. But this time I went I probe any adc to gnd I get .2 👎 About the master side mistake : I think when it asked me to probe gnd and the faulty hall to see reading I tapped the 5v and gnd pad on pcb but forgot to switch over to dc volts. And ir went boom . 😬 don't tell mom. Lol

[2025-06-22T18:47:04] Anthony Meza: I knw u need a dc dc step down convertor get your battery peak voltage and find a converter that drops your voltage down to the rated accessory.
[2025-06-22T18:47:27] Anthony Meza: Hold on rq .. u got a weird one lol
[2025-06-22T18:48:04] Anthony Meza: Does it have a temp probe?
[2025-06-22T18:49:45] 爆弾 👹💣⚠️ ...: I think that if it has a temperature probe it is the most complete, it supports up to 300A and 300V (8V up to 300V), so it is not worth it without modifying anything?
[2025-06-22T18:59:59] Paolo ⁭: This display is big, why do that when you can read current and voltage with vesc?
[2025-06-22T19:00:48] 爆弾 👹💣⚠️ ...: I don't use vesc
[2025-06-22T19:01:01] Anthony Meza: I thought it was a temp gauge. My fault. The big ones go to power the small ones go to what ur measure and the other pair control display. Thick wires go to appliance 1st set thin wires measures volts for it 2nd set thin wires give power to meter.
[2025-06-22T19:02:01] 爆弾 👹💣⚠️ ...: Are they all battery-powered?

[2025-06-22T20:32:53] Happy Giraffe: Just stay foc, run motor calibration on medium inrunner and set amps correctly as the detection values are always stupid
[2025-06-22T20:41:44] L000: g30D Gen 1 Motor for sale tyre needs to be changed because it has 0 profile but motor is perfect

[2025-06-22T20:45:21] Anthony Meza: Wym set amp correctly on motor setting?
[2025-06-22T20:49:06] Matthew: Xt90 handles 100amps no issues but not for a long extended period of time. The xt90 connector normally just have 10-60amps running through them regularly for a scooter so a burst of 100 amps with proper wire gauge and soldering job 10-20 seconds of 100amps is fine. Going over 120amps I would do xt150 or qs8 or similar
[2025-06-22T20:58:23] Matthew: I got some light bar to set lower on the front stem pole since the lightbar i had on the handlebar was blinding drivers. Its nice that it catches their attention that I exist but its directly in their eyes...
[2025-06-22T20:59:53] Matthew: This is an alternative. I bought a different unit rated for 20amps.... about to try it soon.
[2025-06-22T21:08:28] Happy Giraffe: Ofcourse, had it too but adds a lot of bulk to ebike
[2025-06-22T21:16:12] Matthew: Gotcha. I have yet to try what I got
[2025-06-22T21:17:46] Matthew: The default parameters after running setup wizard are a bit funky. You always need to go through the configuration settings to make sure everything is correct. The vesc stuff isn't completely plug and play
[2025-06-22T21:21:34] Matthew: The speed is controlled. You have parameters for rpm. That's speed. You have so many functions capable off of vesc
[2025-06-22T21:35:00] Matthew: Every build if they have a horn is different. Some lights actually have a horn built in. I bought some little disc looking horn that's for scooters and waterproof. Little 12v low draw horn

[2025-06-22T22:07:24] haku: did you see all superior cad designs. let me teach you noob
[2025-06-22T22:07:51] haku: constrains is the goal
[2025-06-22T22:08:02] haku: but it can also be a pain
[2025-06-22T22:08:58] Noname: Listen to me he says
[2025-06-22T22:11:46] haku: i learn from mistakes. no repeat mistakes
[2025-06-22T22:23:02] Happy Giraffe: I meant to say outrunner, got them mixed. Good that Haku typed in
[2025-06-22T22:23:07] Noname: Let's not repeat your low on extra lifes
[2025-06-22T22:23:49] Happy Giraffe: I always used medium just to avoid too much current into the detection
[2025-06-22T22:24:23] Happy Giraffe: Maybe e-moto styles benefit from large option as they are heavier

[2025-06-22T22:59:43] Anthony Meza: Be nice kids 🤭
[2025-06-22T23:03:17] Anthony Meza: Mine stopped working . Never seen it never took it out. Think it's a sound produced by controllers maybe in the lights like u said. No idea haha #whostolemyhorn
[2025-06-22T23:03:50] Noname: We are being nice lol. You haven't been here long enough it's normal
[2025-06-22T23:05:25] Anthony Meza: <video_file>
[2025-06-22T23:08:16] Noname: Ditch the gtp use your brain. That shit just summarizes internet info.
[2025-06-22T23:10:47] Anthony Meza: All those parameters are all for speed dude. He's asking (from what I think) is how fast he can go. Like a MPH/ MPK value that says aye I wna go 75mph . No it doesn't. It's a combo of shiits Idk it's a little confusing at this point if we don't understand the proper terminology either. Soo 🙄 my fault don't listen to me .just my thoughts and we all got em
[2025-06-22T23:16:37] Anthony Meza: Ramp timing is the time it takes for current to rush through from the moment u hit the throttle to achieve your value in motor current or duty cycle. Someone correct me if I'm wrong .
[2025-06-22T23:17:03] Anthony Meza: Hit the help button see what it tells you
[2025-06-22T23:17:44] Anthony Meza: U do u no name

[2025-06-23T00:40:02] Noname: New olight baton 4 because I lost my Lil edc. We'll see if I like it.
[2025-06-23T00:40:17] haku: nice
[2025-06-23T00:40:24] haku: is it 18650?
[2025-06-23T00:40:37] Noname: No
[2025-06-23T00:40:54] Noname: 16340
[2025-06-23T00:41:08] Matthew: For flipsky. I just hear they're in it for the profit and use horrible components to build their units. Quality control is crap. So i hear you either get a great unit which is rare, or you get a unit that just causes you issues which is generally more money out of your pockets. I think they can do well for rc cars or drones. I really don't know. But the experience i had with flipsky and the issues I keep seeing people have is just bad.
[2025-06-23T00:41:33] Noname: What I carry it all day every day
[2025-06-23T00:41:34] haku: i didnt know that size exist.
[2025-06-23T00:41:49] haku: asian size battery
[2025-06-23T00:49:06] Matthew: Yeah, if hes looking for top speed combination then they can get an idea off of kv rating of their motor and voltage. But if looking on how to control limit of rpm theres the setting for erpm. Pretty cool functions to mess with. The erpm settings help a lot with the balance boards like 1 wheel for when approaching the top speed you limit/set the way the power tapers off so you can keep balance easier.
[2025-06-23T01:03:40] Matthew: Wild. Haku did it for r&d and lost some skin... but where do you build the confidence to carve on a turn like that with your scooter knowing if it slides out youre probably out money? 🤯😵‍💫🥴
[2025-06-23T01:05:03] Matthew: They need to get a bigger booty 🙄
[2025-06-23T01:06:49] haku: yea these folks crazy. no wonder they cut thier stems or have short ones
[2025-06-23T01:13:53] Matthew: @Bradhaku has anyone built one kinda like this horrible sketch? Be sitting on the deck with a padded seat and back of seat is high for maximum support haha.
[2025-06-23T01:14:38] haku: theres one guy in reddit i think
[2025-06-23T01:15:15] haku: but yes ive seen it like that or similar
[2025-06-23T01:36:36] Jeferson Rodriguez: Do you ship to Colombia?
[2025-06-23T01:38:41] Noname: @Bradhaku fusion works again downloaded update

[2025-06-23T04:30:10] Matthew: 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 what's this?👀
[2025-06-23T04:39:44] Matthew: I've worked some dod contract jobs..... they waste so much money
[2025-06-23T04:45:21] Noname: There was a guy selling turbo euc things. It was a capacitor for like 300$
[2025-06-23T04:45:40] Noname: Said it prevented cutouts etc
[2025-06-23T04:46:24] Noname: I was like no it might just help it a bit but you can still cutout.
[2025-06-23T05:12:16] haku: you know i had that idea back then so no Vdrop. but james explain its dumb
[2025-06-23T05:14:14] haku: hey payless shoes is good. i wonder what happened to that brand. ali prolly killed it
[2025-06-23T05:16:44] Paolo ⁭: What you mean? I still see flipsky on ali
[2025-06-23T05:22:54] haku: payless shoes. its an american store for cheap shoes. its gone i think. ali prolly killed that brand

[2025-06-24T03:18:48] Matthew: Nice nice
[2025-06-24T03:20:03] Matthew: I have a big frame scooter but I just can't get on board with dual motor. Everytime ive almost crashed bad was because the front wheel tried to throw me to the ground. I really like rwd

[2025-06-24T04:41:24] haku: maybe cuttof killed your vesc. not sure dude.
[2025-06-24T04:53:41] haku: im not a math man but looking at the battery its a 40ah so divide that by the capacity of the cells. so it should be 8p and multiply that by continious orpeak discharge im not sure wich is 150a. this is just pseudo mathematician okay
[2025-06-24T04:54:35] haku: is my meth right boys?
[2025-06-24T04:56:14] haku: if 48g can peak at 18a. thats what im basing my meth
[2025-06-24T05:00:23] haku: i doubt factory will set it at 150a bms though

[2025-06-24T11:45:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So u connected wrong at first ? That was the problem?
[2025-06-24T11:48:34] Rogerio Figueiredo: I used tx and rx instead of TX2 and rx2

[2025-06-24T11:56:26] Rogerio Figueiredo: Only diference is the rx and TX
[2025-06-24T11:56:39] Rogerio Figueiredo: What controller do you have?

[2025-06-24T12:17:27] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Can I turn screen horizontal?
[2025-06-24T12:20:48] Rogerio Figueiredo: From flipksy?
[2025-06-24T12:20:55] Rogerio Figueiredo: Nop
[2025-06-24T12:40:27] S1m 0n: Correct. On my first try i added to much. The motor was overheating. Just a little bit, something as thick as 3-4 hairs between the magnets is perfectly sufficient.
[2025-06-24T12:41:20] S1m 0n: but if the engine gets too hot, it dries out anyway.. it doesn't do as much as you'd expect from it, in my experience
[2025-06-24T12:44:23] Arnau Martinez Casals: I told you haha
[2025-06-24T12:47:31] S1m 0n: Which settings can I test for more torque? I'm using a Kaabo Mantis 10 single motor with 45H magnets and a Makerbase 84100hp. 55A battery current, 90A phase current, speed ramp 0.11, and expo throttle +30%. I'm happy with it. I'm faster, sportier and more efficient than with the original controller (+ShuntMod to 35A) But when starting uphill, it feels weak. The speed only increases very slowly. It was different with the original controller... it just kept going uphill, too.
[2025-06-24T12:49:26] S1m 0n: I also set it to "sensored" up to around 20 km/h. This made a small improvement, but it was still far from the original controller.
[2025-06-24T12:57:53] Paolo ⁭: Of course, original controller is set to 150A phase，you can get same performance if you change phase current
[2025-06-24T13:02:00] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-06-24T13:02:09] Yamal: Better 🫰
[2025-06-24T13:02:49] S1m 0n: I'm not sure if that works? The Makerbase 84100 is rated up to 100A, and I can set the absolute overcurrent to a maximum of 150A. That means I can't set the phase to 150A as well, or I'll have to do without the e-brake, right?
[2025-06-24T13:05:12] Arnau Martinez Casals: If absolute is 150 you can try 120 phase
[2025-06-24T13:05:44] Arnau Martinez Casals: If gets overcurrent low phase keeping the absolute
[2025-06-24T13:07:04] Arnau Martinez Casals: I got one little 100v100a spintend and cant push more than 90a phase without overcurrent with 130 absolute
[2025-06-24T13:07:34] S1m 0n: Thanks, i will try IT Out 👍
[2025-06-24T13:20:01] Martin Kaktits: Is it rated only for 100A? I pushed 170A peak in shitsky 75100
[2025-06-24T13:20:43] Martin Kaktits: Phase amps will be what detrrmine the low speed torque. No way around it
[2025-06-24T13:22:29] Martin Kaktits: From my experience the FF gets in the tiny gaps, crevices between magnets so it always looks like i need more
[2025-06-24T13:26:47] S1m 0n: I understood that the designations are the ratings (conservative) 75100 = 75V/100A
[2025-06-24T13:28:26] S1m 0n: Try it, but check it. I'm sure that if there's too much in there and the engine is spinning fast, it will be pushed everywhere else and not just stay in the gaps.

[2025-06-24T14:55:24] S1m 0n: I'm using a Lisp script to use the Kaabo display (an adaptation of the Vsett Lisp script). I'm not sure if I can change the firmware... it explicitly states to use version 6.05. Or do you mean No Limits?
[2025-06-24T14:56:21] Paolo ⁭: No limits one
[2025-06-24T15:09:01] francois schempers: so with conservative Amps and half full batterie I did 0-60 in 10sec, didn't go faster because no anti wobble, keep in mind that I'm 140kg too ^^ so à skinny dude could do a much better time

[2025-06-24T19:18:24] Yamal: Your light scooter
[2025-06-24T19:21:16] Noname: <animation>
[2025-06-24T19:21:24] Face de Pin Sucé: oh the RM-Light
[2025-06-24T19:23:08] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, it has C350, 22S4P tabless cells, RM-X 2024 motor on rear, small motor on front, Beringer Br4ve brakes, brakestuff discs, extended deck (soon available for Dualtron Victor on our website) carbon fiber deck, titanium pole, smartdisplay, 25KW of power and topspeed 140Kmh when fully charged, but because of small battery it's more often 130+Kmh
[2025-06-24T19:23:32] Face de Pin Sucé: And of course less than 38Kg (37.2Kg actually)
[2025-06-24T19:24:55] Nobrrr: Did you swap phase cables?
[2025-06-24T19:25:01] Nobrrr: 65H LY?
[2025-06-24T19:39:32] Yamal: Nice built
[2025-06-24T19:43:34] francois schempers: yup, for 6mm²
[2025-06-24T19:43:52] francois schempers: no those are the 60h from rage-mechanics
[2025-06-24T19:44:13] francois schempers: but it's LY based
[2025-06-24T20:18:12] Pandalgns: Why in Spain? It will be very expensive.

[2025-06-24T20:47:15] haku: maybe chale express?

[2025-06-24T20:58:02] haku: ask james or rage. he might carry thos motor
[2025-06-24T20:58:37] haku: i am a 50h 16x4 enthusiast. the true alpha motor
[2025-06-24T21:01:32] 爆弾 👹💣⚠️ ...: I bought an 80H engine, but something bigger wouldn't be bad. If I find something bigger, I'll put the 80 in the front and the 90H in the back.
[2025-06-24T21:14:22] Yamal: Frame ?
[2025-06-24T21:18:35] haku: arianna is fast girl yea?
[2025-06-24T21:19:06] haku: yes keep her in your roster. definetely talented
[2025-06-24T21:48:58] Anthony Meza: Yes. Each vesc reads 60a.
[2025-06-24T22:07:35] Martin Kaktits: thats why i ask here
[2025-06-24T22:07:39] Nobrrr: Could you show me the cable intake?
[2025-06-24T22:11:14] Anthony Meza: I did a lil research and found out about Rion tronic curve throttle. Thank you bro that throttle is like my spintend spin y v2 throttle
[2025-06-24T22:12:24] haku: to answer that question as a vesc enthusiast with no hate in my heart. maybe chat gpt is right
[2025-06-24T22:16:05] Noname: It can be drawn to magnets lol no shit it's magnetic.
[2025-06-24T22:17:00] Yamal: That accelerator is very cool
[2025-06-24T22:42:01] 'lekrsu': G2? ^^
[2025-06-24T22:44:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: How do I know what is what ?
[2025-06-24T22:50:30] haku: @SibClimb with all due respect i think in my opinion it would be the best choice for you to have all female racers. it will grow the sport. just from a fans point of view
[2025-06-24T22:52:51] Anthony Meza: I also learned about the davega screen display. It goes to rx TX . I did not know that. Thank you again. 😊
[2025-06-24T23:15:22] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I think the Rion accelerator is like any other accelerator, the only difference is that it is CNC.
[2025-06-24T23:21:23] Yamal: Maxxxxxxxxx
[2025-06-24T23:29:07] Anthony Meza: You're absolutely right it has its tiny little magnet and tiny little sensors tiny little m1.25 screws
[2025-06-24T23:30:00] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 200€ if the CNC sensor is a hall sensor that costs cents 🤷‍♀️
[2025-06-24T23:42:32] Mirono escooters: I'm going insane. This is the input of a throttle into controller. Noise only happens when the vesc BOOTS, not turns on. I am not touching throttle rn, but it has spikes of 2!v Anyone have a clue.. why? First time I see this. It has to be noise from surrounding stuff, but? Wtf? How can I filter that?
[2025-06-24T23:50:44] Rogerio Figueiredo: Connect if no data reverse it

[2025-06-25T01:07:31] Noname: Looks like a garage build. And 42lbs but talks about doing tricks 😆. Project bmx cleaner but small battery.
[2025-06-25T01:11:30] haku: im sure its skatepark capable. but peak g30v2 has the advantage
[2025-06-25T01:12:07] haku: when i heal up. skatepark will be the next video
[2025-06-25T01:13:46] haku: @jamaludin_algarnati where g2 nami videos
[2025-06-25T03:48:01] Matthew: Used some tubeless sealant like I use on everythin tubed or tubeless.
[2025-06-25T04:17:16] haku: looks like the same motor i have on peak g30v2
[2025-06-25T04:17:51] haku: but i doubt it because my phase cables come out off the brake side. wich is stupid
[2025-06-25T06:00:51] Yamal: ? Weekend
[2025-06-25T06:00:58] Yamal: Work / family /
[2025-06-25T06:06:53] Paolo ⁭: Spintend throttle is copied from the rion one
[2025-06-25T06:12:39] haku: spintend throttle is not bad tbh. i dont have physical brakes. so if it dies i die. trust baby
[2025-06-25T06:15:14] haku: all peak g30 variants moving forward will use that throttle
[2025-06-25T06:15:37] skrtt: Hows recovery?
[2025-06-25T06:17:02] haku: sucks but thanks for asking. just watching alot of cad stuff

[2025-06-25T06:18:54] haku: if i shrink atleast my brain grows. you feel me
[2025-06-25T06:19:09] skrtt: U will shrink
[2025-06-25T06:19:46] skrtt: Depending on the amount of time that takes u to recover
[2025-06-25T06:20:08] haku: how about your michelin star project. how is it?
[2025-06-25T06:20:38] skrtt: But for ex i broke my left foot a few years ago and my leg became half of its normal size
[2025-06-25T06:20:47] skrtt: Just muscle loss
[2025-06-25T06:21:14] haku: yea. if its not used or stressed it will shrink. like my cock
[2025-06-25T06:21:30] skrtt: Need some sponsor

[2025-06-25T15:02:05] AG.racing: ah ok these are the values for the 2 controllers
[2025-06-25T15:03:08] AG.racing: Yes would be crazy 🤯 but max speed would be 30kmh without fwk 🤣
[2025-06-25T15:04:11] skrtt: But crazy torque and acceleration
[2025-06-25T15:06:17] AG.racing: yes but the tires could not transfer this power to the ground it will skid

[2025-06-25T15:38:29] AG.racing: no he said the values were for the 2 controllers together
[2025-06-25T15:46:14] Yamal: ^^!
[2025-06-25T15:49:11] Yamal: When using the cambus, it seems that the information is from both controllers together, but the temperature changes in both and the speed, the phase A's also change, but it doesn't make sense when both are close to 500A phase and they actually carry 250A per controller.
[2025-06-25T15:50:20] Yamal: @jamessoderstrom
[2025-06-25T15:50:40] AG.racing: ok I see so the values are for the 2 controllers
[2025-06-25T15:50:59] Yamal: How to find separate information for each controller?
[2025-06-25T15:51:51] AG.racing: That's a good question, it would be nice to be able to have separate information from each controller.

Task: make a LISP script that allows me to use a 3 wire PAS from ebike on vesc. Vesc only supports quadrature. It also has to work with a throttle (which will be mapped to lower speed), so has to work with the adc + pas setting I tried online lisp scripts which are not working anymore, and currently using an arduino to convert the signal, which is silly If you can do this, please PM me
[2025-06-25T17:42:53] Matthew: I dont get why the some companies put the split ring on the cable side. Its a yume y11 motor

[2025-06-25T20:14:15] Yamal: Nice
[2025-06-25T20:17:12] cihan: I'm asking for opinion if I should regrease the headset bearing or not. I used to apply carbon paste on the fork tube where folding clamp holds it since the folding clamp was slipping on the fork tube. Carbon paste really works and it's great. However I accidentally put little amount of carbon paste on the headset bearing too. Now stem right /left movement is really stiff and I find myself leaning more when turning. Do you think I should clean headset bearing and regrease or continue as it is now? By the way I liked how front wheel firms more rigid when turning but I somehow feel I need to balance the scooter often with my body more often now. I recommend carbon paste (I bought Motorex brand if it makes sense) to anyone who has such issues. I was going to apply weakest Loctite retaining compound if carbon paste didn't work which is still too strong to dismantle later on.
[2025-06-25T20:46:34] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I would change everything, put in new bearings.
[2025-06-25T20:55:11] cihan: Thanks. I feel like the bearing gets stiffer by time and will get even more stiff. I don't know how damper feels like when riding but how it feels like a damper is added however with same stiffness on every turning angle.
[2025-06-25T21:03:01] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: When the steering becomes stiff when turning, the bearing or seat is broken.

[2025-06-25T21:05:21] cihan: Do you mean stiff bearings will cause bearing break on the long term? Reason of stiffness now is not broken bearing, it's because of carbon paste inside the bearing.
[2025-06-25T21:15:56] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If the internal paste is dry, it is because dirt gets in and over time it breaks the bearing, which means it becomes stiff when turning.
[2025-06-25T21:18:02] Yamal: Nice project man
[2025-06-25T21:21:20] Yamal: When I joined the vesc group, I thought Ninebot was too small, even strange, currently I have one and I find it very fun, it's cool, and I would love to do a project in it
[2025-06-25T21:22:12] Yamal: I think it's bad that it doesn't have disc brakes.
[2025-06-25T21:22:53] Yamal: and even more to increase its power with the VESC wave
[2025-06-25T21:24:12] Yamal: But it will definitely be my next future project. Why buy a certified, approved Dualtron to prepare it? If I already have a legal one!
[2025-06-25T21:47:41] cihan: Thanks. It's not dry at all but carbon paste creates lots of friction even when there's a lot of grease inside.

[2025-06-26T15:33:48] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: To know the data that must be entered in each section, you must know what kind of beater you have, what voltage you have... it is not just about entering the engine data, that is why you burn the engines due to a bad configuration.

[2025-06-26T17:30:18] Jason: hmm
[2025-06-26T17:30:28] Patrick: 12V idk how to Check since i cant go below the pcb without unscrewing it
[2025-06-26T17:30:39] Jason: check input of 5v buck
[2025-06-26T17:30:41] Jason: its 12v
[2025-06-26T17:30:54] Patrick: Could it be just a firmware problem?
[2025-06-26T17:30:59] Jason: nop

[2025-06-26T21:17:54] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Only 3 pins are used from the UART2 connector. If you have a 4-pin connector, you will have to change it. I think so. 😉☺️
[2025-06-26T21:19:02] Dualtron Achilleus: Hum ok tks
[2025-06-26T21:19:08] Dualtron Achilleus: But why my power button

[2025-06-26T23:03:01] 'lekrsu': You set per controller, per motor. There's a button to enter the second vesc.

[2025-06-26T23:05:52] skrtt: It means that the thickness of the rubber is 30”
[2025-06-26T23:06:06] skrtt: Whatever 30” means 😭
[2025-06-26T23:06:09] Noname: 10" tall x pie 3.14 length of rubber x contact patch
[2025-06-26T23:06:20] Noname: Sorry freedom units lol

[2025-06-26T23:11:42] haku: i think in metric now
[2025-06-26T23:11:51] Noname: Just saying the ammount of rubber that is used is about the surface area of your hand
[2025-06-26T23:12:04] haku: i see.
[2025-06-26T23:19:55] 'lekrsu': <photos/photo_24266@26-06-2025_23-19-55.jpg>
[2025-06-26T23:20:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The more rounded the less good?
[2025-06-26T23:20:53] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Like I can get those at 100/55
[2025-06-26T23:25:15] Noname: The tires lives a short and quick.life because its small
[2025-06-26T23:31:17] Yamal: Why , what happen with monorin?

[2025-06-26T23:33:06] Yamal: Did you find slack in monorim?

[2025-06-26T23:33:52] Yamal: and makes the e-scooter more stable
[2025-06-26T23:38:06] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: How many motors are you using? If you use two, you have to make two configurations.
[2025-06-26T23:38:25] Yamal: https://youtu.be/KkfRh3LYgxA?si=HOHlJR5Gc5jVtROo
[2025-06-26T23:39:43] 'lekrsu': hehe :)
[2025-06-26T23:42:48] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: That depends on your controller and battery. Then you have to check the temperature of both the motor and the controller. If you don't do this, the controller or the motor will burn.
[2025-06-27T00:09:36] Eduuuuuuuuu: Ok thanks, I just installed 100 phases and a 35A battery and it's working fine. After using it for 5m, I noticed the motor was warm.
[2025-06-27T00:10:00] Eduuuuuuuuu: and now I feel a decent torque
[2025-06-27T00:14:44] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: but very hot? or just hot, can you leave your hand on?
[2025-06-27T00:15:17] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Could improve?
[2025-06-27T00:45:44] Matthew: I use a sealant and it helps
[2025-06-27T00:46:03] Matthew: Muc-Off is the brand
[2025-06-27T00:57:57] haku: i have a tiny air leak. i cant find it.
[2025-06-27T03:07:41] Eduuuuuuuuu: I left my hand and it was warm, not even hot.
[2025-06-27T03:08:16] Eduuuuuuuuu: but I used it for a very short time
[2025-06-27T03:08:52] Eduuuuuuuuu: if it burns my hand and I can't stand the heat, then I should lower the power, I imagine
[2025-06-27T03:47:31] haku: burn hands? where? who?
[2025-06-27T04:55:24] Anthony Meza: Fukn funny man 😩I hate tht they sit too high. I'm cuttin' the column for sure. 🪚😎
[2025-06-27T05:25:35] haku: holy crap. please dont find me dude

[2025-06-27T05:31:28] haku: more yamal videos
[2025-06-27T05:31:43] Matthew: I swapped over to 65h 22x3 and I actually hit 9970 watts but I didnt screenshot. This screenshot no field weakening. The 9kw run i had 60amps field weakening. 90amps battery 240phase 16s. After running 65h 17x4 this ride was rather boring. Is the acceleration difference with 20s same settings as my 16s that drastically different?
[2025-06-27T05:34:32] Noname: Thursday
[2025-06-27T05:34:46] Anthony Meza: 🤦

[2025-06-27T09:26:51] Eduuuuuuuuu: Ok thanks
[2025-06-27T09:36:44] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: When you increase the parameters it controls the temperature
[2025-06-27T09:37:37] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Have you changed the phase cables on the motor or does it have the factory ones?
[2025-06-27T10:17:52] haku: ok enough is enough. projects continue tomorrow.
[2025-06-27T10:18:52] haku: 1 am. im a tweaker if i dont work out. fuck me

[2025-06-27T10:21:22] Eduuuuuuuuu: I use factory cable, it's very small, I think it's AWG16, look at the size difference between the vesc and the motor phases
[2025-06-27T10:21:47] Eduuuuuuuuu: <photos/photo_24281@27-06-2025_10-21-47.jpg>

[2025-06-27T10:54:54] Yamal: Wherever
[2025-06-27T10:55:03] Yamal: Almost the same controller and power *

[2025-06-27T11:00:24] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: The cables of the small motors are very thin but if they do not heat up you can leave them
[2025-06-27T12:06:31] Yamal: Almost weekend!!! let’s g0
[2025-06-27T12:06:50] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-06-27T12:31:12] Eduuuuuuuuu: It's better to change them and put in AWG 10, that would improve the winding temperature a lot, wouldn't it?
[2025-06-27T12:36:19] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It will lower the temperature in general, but we are only stipulating the temperature. You have to control it, but it is easy to know where you live. Go up and down the longest hill 2 or 3 times, then touch the engine with your hand. If you can't leave your hand on it for about 10 seconds, I would lower the phase a little. Some say that the engine can reach 100 degrees, but I don't trust it. I prefer to run it colder, to be honest.
[2025-06-27T12:37:50] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If you put AWG 10 plus the hall wires, I don't think the 8 wires in total will fit. It's better to put AWG 11, but the AWG wires are not used for the motors. They can be used, but it's not the best.
[2025-06-27T12:38:59] Eduuuuuuuuu: Okay, thanks. It's just that where I live it's summer and it's very hot. I'm from Seville. I imagine you're Spanish, and you know how hot it is here. Hahaha, I'll do the kickback test.
[2025-06-27T12:39:46] Eduuuuuuuuu: What cables are used for the motors?
[2025-06-27T12:44:48] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If I imagine I'm from Malaga, it's a little less hot because of the sea, so if you're from Seville you'll be able to do the tests well, although it would be better in Cordoba, it's warmer 🤣🤣🤣
[2025-06-27T12:46:21] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Copper wires are better or tinned copper wires
[2025-06-27T12:47:12] Eduuuuuuuuu: I'm confused, I thought AWG wires were pure copper.
[2025-06-27T12:48:13] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Can you send us a link to the cables?
[2025-06-27T12:48:16] Paolo ⁭: I won't repeat again: awg is not a wire type, it just mean American wire gauge, is a measure unit 😅
[2025-06-27T12:48:48] Eduuuuuuuuu: Aaa ok thaks
[2025-06-27T12:48:51] Eduuuuuuuuu: Yes
[2025-06-27T12:49:20] Eduuuuuuuuu: https://patineteplus.com/products/cable-bateria
[2025-06-27T12:49:23] Paolo ⁭: Anyway silicon wires are tinned copper, that's why it's bigger than PVC wire
[2025-06-27T12:49:28] Eduuuuuuuuu: Am buy the awg 8
[2025-06-27T12:49:49] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, there are, sorry, I thought there were only the typical ones with fine wires, meaning you can use copper awg, sorry.
[2025-06-27T12:50:33] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: That's how it is
[2025-06-27T12:51:55] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: for the engine?
[2025-06-27T12:53:39] Eduuuuuuuuu: No, I'll buy AWG 11 like you told me, just in case the cable doesn't fit.
[2025-06-27T12:54:06] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: He encontrado esto en AliExpress: 2,33€ | Cable de cobre PVC cable eléctrico Flexible cable de hilo muy suave altavoz led automático Audio potencia cableado de coche 1 2 4 6 8 10 AWG negro rojo https://a.aliexpress.com/_EyTeYoA
[2025-06-27T12:56:03] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I put AWG 11 in the Wolf 2000w motors because AWG 10 didn't fit and it was too tight.
[2025-06-27T14:19:34] Eduuuuuuuuu: "And did you notice a considerable improvement in the motor temperature

[2025-06-27T22:19:55] Rose: Hey there Yusuf, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-06-27T22:33:54] Yusuf: Hey everyone! My big brother and I are planning to start a project and build our own electric scooter from scratch. We want to use a dual motor setup and we’ve already found a suitable controller for it. The problem is, we’re not sure what software we need to run on the controller or how to set it up properly. Does anyone know what kind of firmware or configuration we need to get everything working? Alternatively, are there any good controllers out there that are already pre-flashed and ready to go for these kinds of DIY projects? That would make it much easier for us to just buy and install them. Any advice is appreciated!
[2025-06-27T22:43:17] 'lekrsu': Mines not broken, today ⛓️‍💥
[2025-06-27T23:01:11] skrtt: 7inch rim yes?

[2025-06-28T00:09:21] Matthew: Vesc units spintend ubox are pretty good. If you have space and money 85250 controllers are stout. But spintend ubox 85150 is a very good controller for its size. People push out 13kw per controller with proper setup.
[2025-06-28T00:14:34] Matthew: Took the 100/100 out on a quick rwd ride with yume y11+. I honestly expected more acceleration than I got. Maybe its the big ass tires, my fat belly, and the scooter weighing 130lbs.
[2025-06-28T00:16:08] Yusuf: Can you send my a link can i buy this on AliExpress ?
[2025-06-28T00:23:59] Matthew: I mean I can give you a link... but i think ordering direct from the company is a better price than ali
[2025-06-28T00:24:15] Matthew: Prices are almost double on ali for me
[2025-06-28T00:26:42] Matthew: Directly from company website

[2025-06-28T20:13:05] Happy Giraffe: How much of a suicide it is to mix Magura and Shimano mineral oil? Doesnt build up any gunk?
[2025-06-28T20:16:03] haku: my mind is telling me no but my body is telling me yes -Rkelly
[2025-06-28T20:24:55] Happy Giraffe: Found my magura oil😁👍
[2025-06-28T20:27:56] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If they are both mineral, nothing happens, except that each brand says that you use their liquid in order to sell something.

[2025-06-28T21:27:26] haku: where do i even see these races. gadam.

[2025-06-28T21:45:25] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I have used Shimano mineral oil in Magura for 2 years without any problems. In fact, when I changed the oil I put in a different mineral oil, it was not Magura but not Shimano either. I had no problems either.
[2025-06-28T21:46:33] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: The rubber seal can be damaged as in all brakes, sometimes it has maintenance to avoid these things.
[2025-06-28T21:48:12] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It's like using dot4 or 10/40 oil if a vehicle uses that oil density, where is the problem if we put in the same oil but from another brand?
[2025-06-28T21:51:32] Yamal: ?
[2025-06-28T21:52:07] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: To prevent the magura from being so spongy, you can use a needle with a higher flow rate, thus sending more force and not having as much dead angle.
[2025-06-28T21:52:10] 'lekrsu': So random
[2025-06-28T21:52:10] skrtt: What maintenance can prevent damage in seals of the lever
[2025-06-28T21:52:20] Happy Giraffe: I meant really mixing them up like 75/25%
[2025-06-28T21:52:24] skrtt: Can u dm me?
[2025-06-28T21:52:32] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: yes for info
[2025-06-28T21:52:45] Happy Giraffe: Interesting, is there a video of this?
[2025-06-28T21:53:04] Happy Giraffe: Maybe you over torqued
[2025-06-28T21:53:10] skrtt: The thing is from what i heard mineral oils is a really vague term
[2025-06-28T21:53:19] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I can do it tomorrow

[2025-06-29T01:37:22] Happy Giraffe: Magura MT5 deal was so nice 40€/$ per piece. Only need to cut hose and bleed as its some weird version thats not ready to use
[2025-06-29T01:42:07] skrtt: The hose is to short. Just buy another one and its good
[2025-06-29T01:42:26] skrtt: I seen one time mt5 for 27€ in that website
[2025-06-29T02:06:19] Happy Giraffe: Oh, I've got an ebike and it was perfect to just cut a bit off from front brake and lot more from rear
[2025-06-29T02:06:54] Happy Giraffe: Damn, I need to have more of them I guess😁
[2025-06-29T02:07:38] skrtt: The 40€ deal have a really short hose i think
[2025-06-29T02:34:41] cihan: How much would you pay for a Vsett 11+ at 1800 km and a dead battery? Seller claims battery is dead because of being unused for months. Somehow battery shouldn't be dead and there should be a BMS protection and battery could be revived.
[2025-06-29T02:34:58] cihan: Seller claims scooter is in pristine condition except the battery.
[2025-06-29T03:43:12] skrtt: Whats the price new

[2025-06-29T11:02:43] Yamal: By the way, have you used a wheel centering kit for motors or not? They recommend it for 80h motors. They say centering them increases the scooter's stability and mostly eliminates the wobbling.
[2025-06-29T11:03:02] Yamal: 100h xD
[2025-06-29T11:03:37] Arnau Martinez Casals: No, i have to put it cause discs will touck floor on track curve

[2025-06-29T11:07:14] Arnau Martinez Casals: It will be a pleasure
[2025-06-29T11:08:19] Yamal: It's impressive where this chassis has come, I hope Michael Sha is watching all this
[2025-06-29T11:09:42] Yamal: We have to take advantage of it, because 2027 is approaching, and we don't know if Nami will finally be left only for the circuits.
[2025-06-29T11:11:18] Yamal: There are a lot of people using G300 from what I see.
[2025-06-29T11:14:12] Yamal: The truth is that today there is not much variety in VESC of controllers for more than 20s that are compact and powerful
[2025-06-29T11:15:30] Yamal: tronic is still inoperative, we don't know what's happening

[2025-06-29T13:11:24] Olexander: Thanks 🤝
[2025-06-29T14:13:42] cihan: Pretty high in Turkey, 3500 USD but I would never pay that price for vsett 11 plus.
[2025-06-29T14:14:21] cihan: You're absolutely right.
[2025-06-29T14:16:57] cihan: Thanks. I also think that BMS triggered protection. I don't think BMS will allow battery voltage drop to dangerous levels when riding. And even if battery voltage was like 3V /cell when left unused it wouldn't drop to 2.5V/cell in some months. What confuses me is could it be controller mulfunctioning. I don't think I'll be able to buy VESC controller for this scooter if I buy it so I'll be using the stock controller for a long time.
[2025-06-29T14:31:46] skrtt: I know that garage eheheheh

[2025-06-29T18:45:36] Yamal: What happened to Punedir and Networkdir? Have they lost their passion for e-scooters? Have they preferred women?
[2025-06-29T18:49:24] Arnau Martinez Casals: Hii anydody can help me with Xiaomi lisp, temperature indicador!
[2025-06-29T18:51:37] Arnau Martinez Casals: Is it setted to turn on display warning when controller Or motor hits 60C? Only modifing the temps warning, it will turn on when it has higher temperature i was thinking in 75C controller and 120C motor.

[2025-06-29T20:07:33] Yamal: O like the idea to make a legal Dualtron like this
[2025-06-29T20:07:39] Yamal: Dt achilleus maybe
[2025-06-29T20:08:06] ausias: thunder and achilleus are the same innthe chasis?
[2025-06-29T20:10:42] skrtt: No
[2025-06-29T20:10:47] skrtt: Different ancho
[2025-06-29T20:11:47] Yamal: Victor the same ?
[2025-06-29T20:15:59] Yamal: What matters is that the front and rear supports of the Achilleus fit into the Thunder case
[2025-06-29T20:16:17] Arnau Martinez Casals: No
[2025-06-29T20:16:20] Arnau Martinez Casals: Mine is dt3

[2025-06-29T20:16:33] Arnau Martinez Casals: Is same as achilleus on wide
[2025-06-29T20:16:56] Arnau Martinez Casals: Difference is dt3 is short like victor, achilleus large like Thunder
[2025-06-29T20:17:04] haku: they ride seated now seems like
[2025-06-29T20:17:16] Arnau Martinez Casals: Fits a 9p, in a Thunder 11,…
[2025-06-29T20:17:35] skrtt: It doesnt fit
[2025-06-29T20:17:57] Arnau Martinez Casals: In my dt3 im building long chasis like Thunders to fit 22s 9p and controller 85250 inside
[2025-06-29T20:18:24] Arnau Martinez Casals: 9p is enough molicel p45b. 92v 40ah
[2025-06-29T20:18:25] haku: who is this failiure @Mirono_escooters?
[2025-06-29T20:18:31] Yamal: Pretty good no need more for Daly and some track
[2025-06-29T20:18:51] Arnau Martinez Casals: Yes i think its enough 9p

[2025-06-29T21:46:09] cihan: It's a ninebot f2 pro. I don't really like it but does the job. Front suspension would better not exist, that wobble on front wheel is annoying. I'll either install a parallel battery for longer range or buy a bigger and faster scooter sometime.
[2025-06-29T21:48:42] Unknown: wdym u dont like the f2pro
[2025-06-29T21:48:45] Unknown: best scooter ever
[2025-06-29T21:50:10] cihan: I have no idea, i didn't talk to them for a long time. Importing things to Turkey via mail is impossible now. You either need to buy yourself from abroad and bring with yourself or ask somebody traveling abroad to buy for yourself so modification is almost impossible. You can buy with mail only via a trade company of someone you are familiar with.
[2025-06-29T21:51:32] Yamal: Maybe some shop there or other people with good staff
[2025-06-29T21:51:37] Yamal: Many scooter there
[2025-06-29T21:51:48] cihan: Front wheel wobble, front disc rotor not parallel to direction of travel and touches the brake pad on some point, hard to adjust. Not good for modification, small deck space. Headset lower bearing in hard pressed with a metal piece inside fork tube, I cannot remove it for degreasing. Not big problems but annoying.
[2025-06-29T21:52:44] cihan: I don't think so. Scooter modification is a hobby very little amount of people like here. And if someone imports a good controller he'll want to sell with big profit.
[2025-06-29T21:53:23] Unknown: i have the same problems
[2025-06-29T21:53:31] Unknown: but tuned it goes 45kmh
[2025-06-29T21:55:44] cihan: Maybe there will be new laws legislated soon about scooters. They want to bring plate and make insurance mandatory for electric scooters so you cannot ride fast, have to obey traffic lights and pay for insurance each year. Cheap Chinese motorbike costs less than scooter and goes faster so electric scooter loses all advantages of new law is legislated.
[2025-06-29T21:55:51] cihan: With Xiaodash?
[2025-06-29T21:57:09] cihan: If you dismantle the front fork never ever tighten the stopper screw on side of the fork tube. Screw head breaks. I have this problem too. I need to find a similar screw and take the one without head out. I should learn the old screw size.
[2025-06-29T21:58:26] Unknown: shu
[2025-06-29T22:00:27] cihan: 45 km/h is not enough for me. I'll still need to ride on the right side of the road and it will be dangerous. Someone always open a car door, join the main road without checking the traffic. In fact riding on right side of the road slow is more dangerous than joining the traffic with scooter and at high speed. F2 pro is hard to stop with that front brake at 45 km/h.
[2025-06-29T22:01:07] cihan: Does it have support for f2 pro? I didn't know.
[2025-06-29T22:01:50] Unknown: no i flashed my dash to be a max g2 dash
[2025-06-29T22:02:09] Unknown: so i could flash g2 firmware
[2025-06-29T22:02:26] Unknown: idk maybe it supports it now
[2025-06-29T22:02:29] cihan: And does it run without problems?
[2025-06-29T22:02:37] Unknown: yeah runs perfectly fine
[2025-06-29T22:02:43] Unknown: range is absolute shit tho
[2025-06-29T22:02:56] Unknown: 15kmh at 40+ continuos
[2025-06-29T22:30:13] K3BAB: https://rescue.company.site/products/rESCue-s3-p580765102
[2025-06-29T22:30:22] K3BAB: this working on ubox lite?
[2025-06-29T22:34:29] cihan: Well, it's expected with such a small battery but it would be fine with a 1000wh external parallel battery. That's what I'm thinking of. However f2 pro is not really worth spending time to modify it probably if you won't use that battery somewhere else later. I need 60+ km/h to join the traffic
[2025-06-29T23:23:56] Dualtron Achilleus: Dt3 - achilleus same frame 18,1 cm width
[2025-06-29T23:24:16] Dualtron Achilleus: Thunder 1-2-3 22,1 width
[2025-06-29T23:24:39] Dualtron Achilleus: Victor smaller that achilleus and dt3
[2025-06-29T23:35:42] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: sl victor I risk that it is smaller than a xiaomi the length of the base
[2025-06-29T23:35:54] skrtt: This battery can theoretically push 75kw right?
[2025-06-29T23:37:00] skrtt: Its 60mm smaller than a thunder
[2025-06-29T23:48:31] ausias: what IS that for
[2025-06-30T00:14:18] cihan: Did you flash with stlink?
[2025-06-30T00:19:02] Unknown: yes
[2025-06-30T00:36:45] cihan: Did you ever notice power usage is less efficient with SHU even when you limit the speed to the same speed stock firmware had before you installed SHU?
[2025-06-30T00:40:31] Unknown: to be honest i never went 22kmh on a trip after tuning it
[2025-06-30T00:52:44] cihan: Thanks. It seems like f2 pro motor has very low Kv. I changed serial number so stock firmware does 32 km/h. However speed starts dropping when battery is 45% full. If Kv was 18, battery voltage would be 25V when speed started to drop which is impossible. I don't know higher or lower Kv is better.
[2025-06-30T00:53:51] Unknown: <photos/photo_24325@30-06-2025_00-53-51.jpg>
[2025-06-30T00:54:09] Unknown: check the serial number on your motor
[2025-06-30T00:54:26] Unknown: i have UMBH for some reason
[2025-06-30T00:55:30] Unknown: yes for me too. after dropping to like 65% the acceleration suddenly gets really bad but topspeed kinda remains the same but it takes some time to get there
[2025-06-30T00:58:39] cihan: Thanks, I'll check.
[2025-06-30T01:00:14] cihan: Battery is too small even for 45 km/h. By the way higher Kv could be better suited for me since I weigh 105-110 kg. It'll have more torque probably. I guess heat won't be a problem at 45-50 km/h.
[2025-06-30T01:01:18] Unknown: Usually higher kv means less torque
[2025-06-30T01:01:58] Unknown: but i can get 45kmh with field weakening set to max frequently
[2025-06-30T01:02:16] cihan: I didn't want to stlink until now since I'm afraid I'll harm water insulation. I'll also need parallel battery together with SHU. Do you know how much current and voltage can stock controller handle? I read 30A and 60V somewhere but not sure.
[2025-06-30T01:02:39] cihan: Ahh, did you try without field weakening?
[2025-06-30T01:02:39] Unknown: no there is a rubber insulation that is permanent
[2025-06-30T01:02:52] Unknown: yes i think like 33 or 34 kmh
[2025-06-30T01:03:04] Unknown: but i weigh 58kg
[2025-06-30T01:03:37] Unknown: no idea tbh. it does 48v tho
[2025-06-30T01:04:55] cihan: I guess it's not worth installing SHU for me unless I also change battery with higher voltage one. It can already do 32 km/h now and acceleration with full battery isn't bad. I would desire higher initial acceleration though.
[2025-06-30T01:06:13] cihan: I like traction control by the way. I used it a few times on ice in winter and it works. I felt safe at 20km/h.
[2025-06-30T01:06:26] cihan: I also felt it working time to time.
[2025-06-30T01:06:36] Unknown: i never used Traction conrol 😭😭
[2025-06-30T01:08:00] cihan: It's jot worth using unless you're on ice or some very slippery ground. I also don't use it when raining too. But I wouldn't be able to get back home without it on icy roads in the morning. I saw many cars skidding.)
[2025-06-30T01:08:40] Unknown: yeah well its summer in germany rn so i definitely wont use it hahah
[2025-06-30T01:15:01] cihan: I wonder if police ever checks scooters for high speed there.
[2025-06-30T01:18:57] Unknown: no not at all

[2025-06-30T14:30:55] Tristan: Application and worried Girlfriend
[2025-06-30T14:33:15] Tristan: Mijia?
[2025-06-30T14:34:50] Yamal: ….
[2025-06-30T14:35:01] Yamal: I mean Xiaomi
[2025-06-30T14:44:23] Tristan: You mean Florian
[2025-06-30T14:45:57] Yamal: I mean your belton project with Mp2 performance
[2025-06-30T14:46:23] Yamal: Cowboy !!!!!!!!
[2025-06-30T15:11:28] Marius: u mean patrick?
[2025-06-30T15:29:08] Yamal: I thought it was Tristan, maybe they have the same profile picture, it doesn't matter this is a buying and selling channel, sorry!
[2025-06-30T15:51:40] Noname: Good morning
[2025-06-30T15:54:16] cihan: I think it's fun to ride on gravel. I really enjoy that sound with bicycle and car. However gravel eats up tires fast.
[2025-06-30T15:58:14] cihan: Well I think it's lower but I'm not sure. I just found diameter of tire and calculated if motor Kv was 18 then I found that battery voltage would be 2.5 V/cell at 32km/h if Kv was 18. However I don't know the diameter of the tire while it's mounted on the scooter and has weight on it, it will be lower, maybe that's why I found a wrong result. Do you have any idea about max voltage stock controller can handle? I thought I'd make an external battery with higher voltage than the original battery and throw away original battery once it gets close to the end of life however internal battery seems like to be working fine until 15000 km.

[2025-06-30T18:51:46] ausias: god bless you
[2025-06-30T18:51:47] ausias: jajaja
[2025-06-30T18:53:05] Matthew: As far as I understand you dont want to go over 240 battery amps. Same for 85250, don't go over 250amps. When I contacted spintend for #'s on 85150 and they told me 150 battery and phase max. But people i believe are running up to 150 battery and 230phase
[2025-06-30T18:54:12] Matthew: If others would please chime in to verify my knowledge
[2025-06-30T18:55:38] Matthew: On my 85250 on 16s rn I have 270phase and 90 battery
[2025-06-30T18:56:08] Yamal: Maybe make fat legal achilleus and g2max Daly single scooter vesc

[2025-06-30T19:24:32] Yamal: ^^’
[2025-06-30T19:26:04] Dualtron Achilleus: This rule so strange
[2025-06-30T19:26:18] Yamal: What
[2025-06-30T19:26:21] Dualtron Achilleus: In France no special rules about 2027 legal or not
[2025-06-30T19:26:27] Yamal: Nice
[2025-06-30T19:27:06] Yamal: Here we are like stupid xD
[2025-06-30T19:27:17] Yamal: All about money i think
[2025-06-30T19:28:47] Dualtron Achilleus: Sell your nami before 2027 to not loss money so
[2025-06-30T19:29:00] Dualtron Achilleus: Like 2026 summer
[2025-06-30T19:33:10] Matthew: @jamessoderstrom and some others here are super familiar with what fries the controllers with certain battery amps and phase amps
[2025-06-30T19:34:11] ausias: i dont have time either but in my job ive asked my manager about gettin some weekends to do that, and for the moment he IS okey bout that

[2025-06-30T20:08:17] haku: what project was this for? what width rim?
[2025-06-30T20:12:34] Tristan: 90/65-6.5
[2025-06-30T20:54:49] 'lekrsu': I'd say 13S before capacitors is an issue, 16S before ADC is, and above that mosfets are.
[2025-06-30T21:25:15] ausias: but, for what is it for
[2025-06-30T21:29:07] skrtt: @SibClimb u back on business?
[2025-06-30T21:49:46] Yamal: I selling, but espensive
[2025-06-30T21:54:33] haku: you breaking up nami. or selling whole
[2025-06-30T22:01:45] Yamal: I've had it for sale for a while, but it's expensive, I really don't want to sell it because it's finally finished and it's super fun... a long time testing engines/electronics etc to get to what it is today, that's why if I sell it it's at a price that I consider good to start new projects and even be able to enjoy something with the family, if not, I won't sell it, there are many experiences with the e-scooter and I really don't think there is a better or more effective chassis
[2025-06-30T22:33:51] ✨🇪🇸عمر: Yes, it's 100% normal, he's tired of selling to individuals.
[2025-06-30T22:34:34] ✨🇪🇸عمر: but don't worry, there is my friend who is an official reseller! 🤣

[2025-06-30T22:41:04] Yamal: Wouhhh
[2025-06-30T22:41:09] Yamal: Eu Tronic
[2025-06-30T22:41:14] Yamal: But 600€……..
[2025-06-30T22:42:33] skrtt: No
[2025-06-30T22:44:42] skrtt: Im trying to rent a circuit for one day
[2025-06-30T22:44:47] skrtt: But they dont let me
[2025-06-30T22:44:52] Dualtron Achilleus: plus not that much motor can take 500 phase atm
[2025-06-30T22:44:59] Dualtron Achilleus: for standing scooter scooter i mean
[2025-06-30T22:52:42] Yamal: But better to have too much, than not enough, besides its temps are great, imagine having 450/475A phase on the rear wheel
[2025-06-30T22:53:17] Yamal: Also 500
[2025-06-30T22:53:37] Yamal: How many time you think can push 500A continuos
[2025-06-30T22:53:45] Dualtron Achilleus: i think only 90h and100h can take this
[2025-06-30T22:54:00] Dualtron Achilleus: but not even sur cuz they are low kV
[2025-06-30T22:54:22] Dualtron Achilleus: maybe 10 min racing
[2025-06-30T22:54:47] Dualtron Achilleus: but you need to target
[2025-06-30T22:54:52] Dualtron Achilleus: effficiency
[2025-06-30T22:55:06] Dualtron Achilleus: rfp even lower his phase from 400 to 350
[2025-06-30T22:55:20] Dualtron Achilleus: he say that cuz more heat that real gains
[2025-06-30T22:55:28] Yamal: Dual 100h and x12 on g2 is crazy?
[2025-06-30T22:55:44] skrtt: Their spinted?
[2025-06-30T22:55:46] Dualtron Achilleus: why on g2 xd
[2025-06-30T22:55:50] skrtt: Humble
[2025-06-30T22:56:02] Dualtron Achilleus: yeah the one he modify
[2025-06-30T22:58:02] Yamal: Make something cute
[2025-06-30T22:59:36] Dualtron Achilleus: where you put a real battery here 😂
[2025-06-30T23:01:54] Yamal: 20s6p 40or50pl xD
[2025-06-30T23:03:28] Dualtron Achilleus: can be fun yeah
[2025-06-30T23:03:45] Dualtron Achilleus: i guess will be light weight
[2025-06-30T23:03:59] Dualtron Achilleus: good to break some 0-100 draggy
[2025-06-30T23:12:30] Yamal: Hehe
[2025-06-30T23:12:36] Yamal: Draggy!
[2025-06-30T23:12:41] Yamal: Brembo!
[2025-06-30T23:12:44] Yamal: ^^
[2025-06-30T23:15:01] ✨🇪🇸عمر: exact !
[2025-06-30T23:15:19] Yamal: How your beast going man !!
[2025-06-30T23:15:22] Yamal: ❗️
[2025-06-30T23:15:24] Yamal: ❗️

[2025-06-30T23:15:26] Yamal: ❗️
[2025-06-30T23:15:26] Rose: Slow down with the flooding! Yamal has been temporarily muted for 2 minutes.
[2025-06-30T23:16:16] ✨🇪🇸عمر: I had a problem with the technical inspection 🥲🥲🥲
[2025-06-30T23:18:41] ✨🇪🇸عمر: the controller told me that my circuit breaker is not working correctly, so I redid the entire wiring, but my ADC no longer worked 🤣 so I moved everything to the 2nd controller, and it was impossible to redo my motor configuration. I chained the cut abs over current so I had to lower it to 260a phase 🥲🥲
[2025-06-30T23:20:24] ✨🇪🇸عمر: unfortunately @Foujiwara, is not a standard to follow, look at his driving completely different from everyone else, but he manages to make high scores, same for his machine
[2025-06-30T23:20:59] ✨🇪🇸عمر: It's not because you put 350A as RFP that you will have the same power
[2025-06-30T23:39:35] Yamal: But 300A work okay
[2025-06-30T23:40:32] Yamal: Price / performance spintend is really cool
[2025-06-30T23:42:18] Noname: Oof might rain tomorrow. In the NW corner or Maryland at a hotel 😔

[2025-07-01T09:19:49] Jason: xd
[2025-07-01T09:20:19] Hackintoshhhh: Tbh for what im driving daily tenpower 40tg would’ve been more than enough

[2025-07-01T09:26:11] Yamal: Heavy?
[2025-07-01T10:01:07] Yamal: What is your autonomy? How many kilometers can you get out of Lima?

[2025-07-01T10:19:05] Yamal: Maybe profile ?
[2025-07-01T10:20:54] Marius: accel as in phase amps?
[2025-07-01T10:23:55] Yamal: I'm referring to a profile in Vesc Tool. You can decide the maximum kW you want to work with.
[2025-07-01T10:27:39] Yamal: Pretty cool
[2025-07-01T10:28:48] Marius: i know. im just asking which settings specifically he is referencing
[2025-07-01T10:36:26] Yamal: Which is your vehicle Marius

[2025-07-01T11:01:56] ausias: this one IS coming soon
[2025-07-01T11:03:52] Yamal: You have the second controller
[2025-07-01T11:03:55] Yamal: Or no yet
[2025-07-01T11:06:28] Yamal: Try to make custom case(box) for the controller
[2025-07-01T11:06:50] Yamal: I don’t have ,, and I really need
[2025-07-01T11:14:06] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: @SibClimb -Vesc- Tronic750 start with observer ortega original giving full throttle error with high phase amps (500) abs over current but after 20kmh i can give full throttle without problems if using observer mxlemming good start but cant pass 40kmh after that making sound in motor and same error Has a friend has same problem with 3chull Am asking if you had same problem and if do how fix ?(Anyone who knows how to help feel free to chime in)
[2025-07-01T11:15:49] Yamal: What I mean is, Nami users have their electronics very exposed. It's clear that we're not going to ride e-scooters when it's raining, but you never know if you might get caught in a drizzle, step in a puddle or ride on dirt tracks. In short, it's good to have it insulated. Currently, after the last Ubox breakdown, I absolutely don't step on a sandy track and I'm always aware of the water.
[2025-07-01T11:17:41] Face de Pin Sucé: It's a parameter problem from what I read, but which one, complicated to tell with not much informations
[2025-07-01T11:25:33] Rose: Hey there Леон, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-07-01T11:26:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ma guuuuy
[2025-07-01T11:31:21] леон: Can i know what information will help you?
[2025-07-01T11:39:06] ausias: not yet
[2025-07-01T11:39:18] ausias: im part of wepoor right now jajajaja
[2025-07-01T11:39:56] ausias: im talking to a guy Who designs in 3d to make something
[2025-07-01T11:40:28] ausias: but i want It with some holes to get air in and in a way to prevent water gettin in
[2025-07-01T11:40:44] ausias: yup
[2025-07-01T11:41:21] ausias: i was with the kelly on the bottom and the cables where full of dust and i dont go in sand or nothing like that
[2025-07-01T11:42:23] ausias: Who in the group had the 3d case for the spintend?
[2025-07-01T12:49:47] Paolo ⁭: Did you adjusted inductance by reducing 30-35% ?
[2025-07-01T12:52:43] Martin Kaktits: Try motot detection when motor is warm. Increase hall sensor erpm.
[2025-07-01T12:52:52] ausias: <video_file>
[2025-07-01T12:55:01] Yamal: 💃
[2025-07-01T13:13:21] Yamal: You have to reverse the engine so that the valve falls to the phase part.?
[2025-07-01T13:32:08] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 💣

[2025-07-01T14:01:38] леон: where im changing that?
[2025-07-01T14:18:34] Paolo ⁭: Foc sensorless
[2025-07-01T14:26:22] леон: thank you
[2025-07-01T14:31:39] Yamal: Good afternoon, everyone. Would you mind starting to showcase your projects on Vesc Project Paradise? I'd need a one-minute video, a screenshot of Vesc Tool, specifications, and your choice of music! My channel isn't meant to go "viral," but rather to show people the excellence of electric mobility.
[2025-07-01T14:45:01] Noname: @Bradhaku that car new

[2025-07-01T16:59:54] ausias: i Will once i get the both controllers
[2025-07-01T17:17:01] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Someone who has the g300 could tell me how to configure the on/off button in the Vesc app. The only thing I know is that it is in the IMU tab, but whoever buys them doesn't know it, like many other things 🤷‍♀️
[2025-07-01T17:17:40] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: He doesn't know it or doesn't want to say it, everything is possible in this life 🤣🤣
[2025-07-01T17:25:41] Dualtron Achilleus: I asked to julien (fastride)
[2025-07-01T18:06:55] Paolo ⁭: What do you mean configure on/off button?
[2025-07-01T18:25:53] Arnau Martinez Casals: Its a push-botton not a on off button
[2025-07-01T18:26:26] Arnau Martinez Casals: So you have to change it
[2025-07-01T18:26:56] Arnau Martinez Casals: I dont remember how exactly, it was on adc i thick
[2025-07-01T18:31:18] Arnau Martinez Casals: Mine doing that on single motor 6.06
[2025-07-01T18:32:02] Arnau Martinez Casals: When i hit more than 70% throttle starts making sound motor
[2025-07-01T18:33:27] Arnau Martinez Casals: My friend say me cause firmware 6.06 is not too good for “small” motors 50h 17x4. Other scooter i recently build with 6.06 doesn’t make that sound but he has a 75h 22x3
[2025-07-01T18:33:42] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: to configure the button
[2025-07-01T18:34:16] Arnau Martinez Casals: I thinck its just for amps Or like he said bad parameter
[2025-07-01T18:34:51] Arnau Martinez Casals: Cause with less amps it doesnt start making noise motor
[2025-07-01T18:35:51] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It's temporary like a PC. I know it has to be configured, but again, nobody knows or doesn't remember. 🤷‍♀️☺️
[2025-07-01T18:43:06] Paolo ⁭: Ah maybe I know what you want
[2025-07-01T18:43:43] Paolo ⁭: App->general->shutdown mode-> shutdown after 0 seconds
[2025-07-01T18:44:00] Paolo ⁭: Or something similar, I don't remind since I'm not on pc
[2025-07-01T18:47:09] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: The controller has auto shut off but I want to use the button to turn it on and off.
[2025-07-01T18:52:14] Paolo ⁭: What is the current setting of autoshutoff?
[2025-07-01T19:00:02] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I didn't look at it, the only thing I know is that it has an auto-off feature because I read it.
[2025-07-01T19:25:48] haku: yea

[2025-07-02T07:20:16] Yamal: I dedicate this song to Mirono Scooter, in the same way I dedicated it to him last summer, maybe he doesn't remember it anymore :)
[2025-07-02T07:51:40] cihan: I recommend sintered metal brake pads to anyone desiring the same stopping force with less pressure on disc. Ninebot f2 pro has wobble problem when braking and it's reduced a lot with sintered brake pads and cheap (probably softer metal) disc rotor. I guess sintered brake pad had higher friction with a cheap soft metal disc rotor compared to higher quality harder metal rotor. I feel the same when sharpening knives. Softer metal cheap knives always have higher friction between the sharpening tool. Braking feel is different compared to semi metallic brake pads. Light braking has almost no effect but harder braking instantly increases braking power after 1/2 turns when pad and rotor gets warmer probably. I also like the sound of the brake and feel how pads are eating away the rotor. I don't care about the rotor since each 120 mm rotor costs me 2 USD from Temu. I guess I've solved the wobble problem when braking forever and feeling happy.)
[2025-07-02T07:55:36] cihan: Now the brake has Voith retarder like sound which I always enjoyed during bus trips.)

[2025-07-02T08:05:50] cihan: I asked chatgpt and it told me tightening the screws of disc rotor with more than manufacturer recommended torque can warp the rotor. Did anyone experience it before?
[2025-07-02T08:09:11] Arnau Martinez Casals: It has to change a button selection i thinck only
[2025-07-02T08:13:44] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It's like saying buy something but you don't know where to do it, with James' explanation I think I understood it, in a few days I will try it, thanks
[2025-07-02T08:18:57] Paolo ⁭: The button probability already works, but you have to wait the auto shut off time. The auto shutoff start from when you click the switch and turn it off, I guess

[2025-07-02T23:31:04] Dualtron Achilleus: yeah sur
[2025-07-02T23:32:27] Yamal: I think that if you have a MoliCel battery capable of supporting 400A of battery with 600A of phase, it's amazing.
[2025-07-02T23:35:16] Noname: Mabey cruise around this town of 1500 people later

[2025-07-03T01:33:25] Rogerio Figueiredo: Tubed is nice
[2025-07-03T01:33:54] skrtt: Tubed might explode with a lot of rotation and heat
[2025-07-03T01:35:05] Rogerio Figueiredo: For racing yes
[2025-07-03T01:35:19] skrtt: Even daily if u push it a lot
[2025-07-03T01:35:35] skrtt: Thats why i payed more to get tubeless
[2025-07-03T01:35:50] skrtt: That and smaller opening
[2025-07-03T01:42:54] Rogerio Figueiredo: I will not do that if I bought new motors
[2025-07-03T01:43:02] Rogerio Figueiredo: I'm using vsett with tubs for so long

[2025-07-03T01:54:46] skrtt: I dont think is that much of a difference to go tubeless already with rim
[2025-07-03T02:15:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Can't convert them to tublless somehow?
[2025-07-03T02:34:46] skrtt: Nop cuz half of the rim is the motor

[2025-07-03T07:50:01] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: You just have to know how much wider one engine is than another to know how much to separate the arms.
[2025-07-03T08:42:10] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm more talking about how much spacers for motor axle itself

[2025-07-03T09:09:43] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If I understood you, I didn't put spacers on my scooter. I have 70h engines. To know what spacers are needed, you just have to know how much wider the new engine is.

[2025-07-03T09:57:12] Patrick: As i know you shouldnt increase protection values in this case, motor parameters i can fix but the restarts are more important to me
[2025-07-03T09:57:24] Patrick: Restart is a Hardware Problem i got told
[2025-07-03T09:57:25] Eduuuuuuuuu: How much is your BMS?

[2025-07-03T09:58:36] Eduuuuuuuuu: Increase the absolute max current and it should be fixed.
[2025-07-03T09:59:28] Eduuuuuuuuu: What engine do you use?
[2025-07-03T10:00:14] Patrick: 65H 17x4 delta
[2025-07-03T10:00:21] Patrick: But my problem is the self restart
[2025-07-03T10:00:31] Patrick: Abs overcurrent i will get fixed at some point
[2025-07-03T10:00:36] Patrick: But self restart i neef help
[2025-07-03T10:00:45] Patrick: Asked 3 people noone was able to help me yet
[2025-07-03T10:02:00] леон: yoo its fully restarting?
[2025-07-03T10:02:21] Patrick: Yea got told some Hardware problem
[2025-07-03T10:02:30] Patrick: But no idea what
[2025-07-03T10:02:39] Patrick: I mean cant really check voltages while driving aswell
[2025-07-03T10:02:40] леон: tryed to use other hw versions?
[2025-07-03T10:02:59] Patrick: I even use a tested Version right now
[2025-07-03T10:03:04] Patrick: All saftey Features on
[2025-07-03T10:04:28] леон: try re-uploading the same version, if I have any errors, this fixes everything, for example, my can bus didn't work, re-uploading the firmware helped
[2025-07-03T10:04:44] леон: but you need to set all from 0
[2025-07-03T10:04:47] леон: after
[2025-07-03T10:14:36] леон: or motor noise problems or lisp didnt work fixed aswell
[2025-07-03T10:16:09] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Harder for me then u think my eyes play with me and prescription also if someone already done that why no copy their homework
[2025-07-03T10:16:18] леон: i seen testing with it on enduro with 650a phase 350battery amps and 350a field on dirt was hard trsting with overheats

[2025-07-03T10:37:16] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: All the 75h 155 lonnyo are same And all the dualtron thunders stock suspension are same

[2025-07-03T10:43:06] Paolo ⁭: Can you share test data?
[2025-07-03T10:44:31] Paolo ⁭: Tronic 750 it's on 24 to-247 fet and they were not really good
[2025-07-03T10:46:41] Face de Pin Sucé: He's right, only one thin on wire side
[2025-07-03T10:47:18] Face de Pin Sucé: And you must know one thing, all motors from LY have differences on axles, up to more than 5mm
[2025-07-03T10:55:56] леон: ok when i be home
[2025-07-03T11:01:30] Paolo ⁭: Just saying vesc like 3shul 4 fet is better at my opinion

[2025-07-03T12:28:49] haku: sad to see. fardriver winning the esc here. american vescs no more seems like
[2025-07-03T13:18:54] V: up
[2025-07-03T13:21:06] V: Hello, just wondering what’s better for a stock vsett 11+ 60v 31.2ah 1500w motors *2 A flipsky 75100 dual with alu pcb or flipsky ft85bd?
[2025-07-03T13:26:55] леон: i have 2 controllers
[2025-07-03T13:27:15] леон: 600 rear 400 front i will use
[2025-07-03T13:27:19] леон: yea sure
[2025-07-03T13:27:25] леон: im not that crazy
[2025-07-03T13:27:53] леон: there is no motors for scooter that will hold 1000a phase)
[2025-07-03T13:30:37] 'lekrsu': Mosfet rating is often at low temps such as 25C as well
[2025-07-03T13:30:46] Nobrrr: Since the motor has very low resistance my guess is that there are high current spikes which cause abs to trigger
[2025-07-03T13:30:58] Nobrrr: I would just set it at 300A
[2025-07-03T13:31:23] Nobrrr: I guess that just a problem with delta and a low resistance
[2025-07-03T13:33:17] Patrick: Yea also if we consider that i had restarts already without a abs overcurrent
[2025-07-03T13:44:55] V: 75100 dual it is then I assume?
[2025-07-03T13:47:01] Unknown: Hi my LY 65H axle is broken I am from Denmark and I wanted to ask if someone in here could replace it with a new one I already have access to new axle. Name me a price on how much the service would cost. Thanks

[2025-07-03T18:55:32] haku: you just need a hydraulic press i think
[2025-07-03T18:56:37] Unknown: yea but il try with the one i have access to but if not then yea i would need someone else to do it
[2025-07-03T18:56:46] Unknown: just found it someone in my family had a old one

[2025-07-04T18:45:09] Arnau Martinez Casals: Try here putting voltage series and ah
[2025-07-04T19:17:28] Matthew: Most people in here are using spintend products. Flipsky is more hit or miss with their poor quality control. But someone else can correct me if I'm wrong. For 72v(20s) you would need spintend higher voltage controllers. They have 3 different models 85v controllers max and there is a 100/100 alu lite model and i suggest not getting the 100/100 as its decent for lower power builds and it is super small so if space is an issue then it can be and option for lower power but people definitely recommend 85150 ubox over the 100/100 lite.. 1 model is 85250 ubox single. 85240 ubox single. 85150 ubox single. The 85150 ubox is a stout controller for its size. People are pushing 13kw on 72v and the controllers are significantly smaller than 85250/240 so you have more options for installation space. I have not used this other adc3 device but it is supposed to allow more accessories and extra function capabilities.
[2025-07-04T19:19:25] Matthew: There's this dedicated dual controller but max voltage is 18s. But it has all the other adc3 add on device capabilities. The guys say its a dated controller but still good. Youre also limited to 100amps per motor.
[2025-07-04T19:21:03] Matthew: This guy here is a ripper. People are pushing ~13kw @72v per controller.... so unless you want more power than that this controller is the one I like the most. 85250 is obviously a stout controller but its giant compared to 85150.
[2025-07-04T19:23:26] Matthew: This is device to add on to the 85250/240/150. As far as I understand that device will basically have the capabilities that the 75100 dual controller has. Or there's the option of getting a stepdown converter to 12v. I got a 20amps 12v stepdown converter for my build and am going to try it out today I think.

[2025-07-04T21:27:25] Matthew: Is this the motor that some of you guys are running?
[2025-07-04T21:34:17] Matthew: How do or what do you do to have the access some of you guys have for machinists type of work?
[2025-07-04T21:37:14] Yamal: But ,,,,,,,,
[2025-07-04T21:37:18] Yamal: Why……
[2025-07-04T21:37:30] Yamal: E-scooter ,, no seat
[2025-07-04T21:37:32] Yamal: Stand ..?
[2025-07-04T21:38:09] Yamal: 😆
[2025-07-04T21:50:39] haku: someone made me this. i just wanted to share
[2025-07-04T21:51:09] haku: i cant find his name here. shoutout to the ai simone
[2025-07-04T21:55:37] Yamal: Must put Minibmx frame
[2025-07-04T21:55:47] haku: yea but get tubeless split. easier
[2025-07-04T21:57:53] haku: if i knew how i would
[2025-07-04T21:58:10] haku: peak g30v2 silouhuette
[2025-07-04T22:13:53] Matthew: Do you happen to know if company website or direct contact has a better price?
[2025-07-04T22:20:33] haku: no idea man tbh
[2025-07-04T22:26:06] Matthew: All good.
[2025-07-04T22:27:56] haku: i bought mine off ali because of impulsivness. no reseaerch. there are better deals seems like
[2025-07-04T22:30:27] Rogerio Figueiredo: I did that
[2025-07-04T22:35:54] Yamal: Now you can ride at night with the new mini BMX lights around the neighborhood
[2025-07-04T22:36:35] Yamal: follow old Tom
[2025-07-04T22:36:45] haku: its a scooter yamal
[2025-07-04T22:42:00] Yamal: Vesc scooter bike
[2025-07-04T22:42:31] Yamal: Still have your G30 right
[2025-07-04T22:44:29] Yamal: You have a lot of electric vehicles and completed projects ^^
[2025-07-04T22:45:14] Yamal: I would love to see the G2 on the wave
[2025-07-04T22:45:40] Yamal: But no yet 💰💰💰
[2025-07-04T22:47:12] Matthew: Ok cool cool
[2025-07-04T22:49:00] Matthew: When I bought my first vsett motor off alien rides they were only $100usd and then when I went for 2nd motor it went up to $160... me thinking i should have bought like 4 of them. Lonnyo direct contact was $330 to my spot.
[2025-07-04T22:55:03] haku: yea. 2
[2025-07-04T22:55:25] haku: need to sell. collecting dust. maybe ill ride it later we will see
[2025-07-04T22:56:55] haku: yea i got tagged in that deal. but didnt bite. idiot mistake
[2025-07-04T22:57:31] haku: that was before the peak g30 idea
[2025-07-04T22:58:12] haku: now i think dual 50 16x4 is perfect for these little shits. maybe 22x3
[2025-07-04T23:19:59] Yamal: 22/3 is nice ,, nicely torque , nicely top speed
[2025-07-04T23:22:32] Yamal: I've never tried 16/4, 17/4 yes, but I think they have to be similar...
[2025-07-04T23:23:13] Yamal: Your 70 h are your spearhead, sharpen it! XD
[2025-07-05T00:03:10] Yamal: Looking forward to seeing the results of the many projects in this group, and Noname continues traveling with her e-bike?
[2025-07-05T00:05:09] haku: always need projects yamal. remember an idle mind is the devils playground
[2025-07-05T00:12:50] Yamal: Projects are wonderful, but if you don't have money for parts etc, there is no project.
[2025-07-05T00:15:35] Yamal: Apart from the G2, I would like a large certified Dualtron and power it with VESC and good components. I would also like an e-scooter for dirt and country roads, because there are many interesting routes and the routes on this medium are usually fun and there is no one who can bother you or fine you.
[2025-07-05T00:22:46] Noname: And that's it folks driving home tonight
[2025-07-05T00:22:47] Noname: <photos/photo_24449@05-07-2025_00-22-47.jpg>
[2025-07-05T00:22:47] Noname: <photos/photo_24450@05-07-2025_00-22-47.jpg>
[2025-07-05T00:22:48] Noname: <photos/photo_24451@05-07-2025_00-22-48.jpg>
[2025-07-05T00:25:03] Yamal: Wouh man pretty adventure
[2025-07-05T00:25:30] Yamal: How many days driving ?
[2025-07-05T00:25:50] Noname: 9-10 hours
[2025-07-05T00:34:59] Yamal: but I've seen you many days on the road
[2025-07-05T00:38:43] Noname: We were on the Great Allegheny passage and C&O rail trail. Its like 300+ miles
[2025-07-05T00:40:25] Noname: So you drive on bike trail and stop at these little towns along the way. I think its they're only income lol
[2025-07-05T01:00:30] Matthew: I need to experience the vsett again soon... I put this 65h 22x3 motor on like a week or 2 ago just to see how it did with the 85250 since I unlocked to no limits. The motor is a different feeling all together for me. It takes off decent now from zero speed. I was limited to 150amps phase and it was extremely lackluster from zero speed. Its more well rounded now imo with 260phase it leaves a lot better and then the push keeps increasing and around 35mph its like a turbo just spooled up and it starts pushing pretty nice 😁. I got used to the backflip torque on the 65h 17x4 motor and it is way more fun to me. But youre running dual motor i am assuming so if 65h 22x3 dual and a good battery its gonna be wild lol
[2025-07-05T01:02:01] Oreo huzky: New vesc display background
[2025-07-05T01:06:48] Matthew: Wouldn't 17x4 have a slight bit higher speed? Im learning...
[2025-07-05T01:20:52] Paolo ⁭: In the reality there's no difference
[2025-07-05T02:36:21] haku: guys this is 50h 16x4 motor yea but 6" rim? I just found this on AliExpress: $250.43 | 60V 2800W Brushless Motor E-Bike Hub Wheel for Front/Rear Drive Electric scooter https://a.aliexpress.com/_mNae7YR

[2025-07-05T03:11:35] haku: you own all the tools
[2025-07-05T03:12:40] Noname: Bought that suff a long time ago
[2025-07-05T03:29:34] Matthew: In case anyone is wondering how it is to have two bloodhounds... this happens all the time. Volume up a bit...
[2025-07-05T03:37:13] Matthew: I am gonna see if I can find that dudes post for the dragster vespa scooter haha. I believe hes using those motors and goes like 80mph with some amazon controller
[2025-07-05T03:43:26] haku: yep this is the begining of the end boys. https://youtu.be/_auYNqWXA38?si=BaBwglXjFPb07sOK

[2025-07-05T03:46:50] Noname: Always do
[2025-07-05T03:49:18] Noname: If they were only smart enough to buy the road legal models but then you can't be a deuche when your plated

[2025-07-05T03:54:16] haku: its actually feds that got me. not local pd. park rangers
[2025-07-05T03:55:36] haku: little peak g30v2 flies under the radar even going car speeds
[2025-07-05T03:56:06] Noname: Well our group got a talking to by a park employee. Couldn't do anything but say not allowed. I showed him my class 2 badge. He said 15mph I said yeah its 20 bevause that's the class your park is different. We went slow 😆
[2025-07-05T03:59:33] haku: my biggest concern is if my city becomes like one of those eu countries. like crackdowns and dynos
[2025-07-05T03:59:46] haku: ive predicted this in 2023
[2025-07-05T04:00:24] haku: dynos even on pedal assist bikes 😭

[2025-07-05T04:05:14] haku: i really like odd vehicles though. the smallest of small
[2025-07-05T04:13:30] haku: ive already amassed a wealth of knowledge on these things. but still lots to learn
[2025-07-05T04:17:11] haku: need to figure out a way how to put cranks chain and gears on a scooter hub
[2025-07-05T04:19:18] Matthew: I couldn't share a link... and he doesn't say other that Amazon stuff
[2025-07-05T04:42:29] haku: american made boys! happy 4th

[2025-07-05T05:36:28] haku: that 20x3 60h ali huameng motor really makes me wonder.
[2025-07-05T05:43:29] Yamal: Ly better right

[2025-07-05T05:45:45] Yamal: I am happy with the choice of 80h
[2025-07-05T05:46:42] haku: good motor. your comparing a $500 to a 100 motor
[2025-07-05T05:47:14] Yamal: Me 250 if I remember well
[2025-07-05T05:47:23] haku: yes no rim

[2025-07-05T05:53:21] haku: it will be built asoon as all this ebike laws calm down
[2025-07-05T05:54:18] haku: i have foresight when it comes to these things you know. i can feel it in my gut. its comfiscatable
[2025-07-05T05:55:00] haku: specially now surron boys in hiding. ill be the odd one
[2025-07-05T05:56:27] haku: thats what they get wilding up and calling my vsett gay
[2025-07-05T05:58:05] haku: to be fair vsett9 is kinda gay
[2025-07-05T05:58:18] Yamal: The laws here are also delicate, and they often fine us for no reason, but we go out there and drive! We are the resistance, and we love driving our vehicles! Because when our last foot flies and leaves the ground, we are free!
[2025-07-05T05:59:14] Yamal: 5:58 am Saturday, finished breakfast to get out there!
[2025-07-05T05:59:41] Matthew: They are and its because most driving them are irresponsible kids
[2025-07-05T06:01:38] Yamal: What I'm trying to say is, don't be intimidated! Enjoy every second and be happy
[2025-07-05T06:02:11] Yamal: Haku rider 💪
[2025-07-05T06:02:57] Matthew: Dude.... hearing about pedal assist only and 250 watts and im thinking would 250watts even move my fat ass
[2025-07-05T06:03:17] Noname: On flat yes
[2025-07-05T06:03:46] Yamal: Voro motor is nothing compared to your industry!!!!
[2025-07-05T06:03:48] Yamal: XD
[2025-07-05T06:04:00] Noname: Not fast better off 250w + downhill
[2025-07-05T06:04:50] haku: yea 250 is ridiculous
[2025-07-05T06:05:04] Matthew: Dude, do a dead setup lol. I seen people flying along in motorized bicycle with pedals setup but no chain and they just pretend theyre kinda pedaling lol.
[2025-07-05T06:05:28] haku: i can do 500w on a bike machine
[2025-07-05T06:05:48] Noname: I was doing that today. Chain is there but pedals geared for 3mph lol
[2025-07-05T06:06:03] Matthew: I dont know, fat tire bike me 230lbs with my gear... I guess flat would happen
[2025-07-05T06:06:42] Noname: I was running 600w going 20 downhill on chipstone
[2025-07-05T06:08:25] Matthew: Nice
[2025-07-05T06:11:42] Matthew: That stuff works haha. Even at work if youre a welder and the office is clueless... one dude i worked with tacked up a couple plates in different spots on a welding fixture we put tubing and whatnot to build frames. We literally are dead no work or parts to do anything. He'd just smoke cigarettes and go and pull the mig gun trigger to just look like hes tacking frames together... had me rolling when I finally found out what he was doing. I was a new employee. Hilarious
[2025-07-05T06:12:45] Noname: Just walk fast nobody questions you
[2025-07-05T06:12:46] Matthew: Point is he stayed there smoking cigarettes all day while the rest of us are sweeping and organizing crap lol
[2025-07-05T06:13:22] Noname: If my boss is in the shop I just fly by and go smoke a butt out back lol
[2025-07-05T06:13:37] Matthew: Haha. Nice
[2025-07-05T06:15:53] Noname: I was on a job with a bunch of assholes as an electrician. I was asked to do fire alarm wiring as my work was the nicest. I would just walk around when my shit was done and if I saw someone I just looked up and kinda pointed like I was counting something in the ceiling
[2025-07-05T06:16:37] Matthew: I haven't given a new metal song today. Here is a cover of a song by Iron Maiden. If you ask me and many others, the song cover definitely doesn't kill the song... very good cover
[2025-07-05T06:16:42] Matthew: https://youtu.be/XU0bpLyw764?si=gd7UcRqQ7aVhZP6h
[2025-07-05T06:28:10] Matthew: Happy 4th!!
[2025-07-05T06:29:00] Matthew: Whats the opening for it?
[2025-07-05T06:30:48] Matthew: Im in the same boat. Tomorrow taking good pictures of everything and putting up on fb marketplace, craigslist too hell, maybe even go sit at the flea market haha
[2025-07-05T06:35:06] Yamal: 155
[2025-07-05T06:44:15] haku: i was tailing a cop. didnt bat an eye. peak g30 is safe.
[2025-07-05T06:45:18] haku: cop going to pull me over when 100s of illegal fireworks getting lit. get fucked
[2025-07-05T08:52:50] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Hello, good morning, could you tell me where to get the FW for the G300? I can't find anything in the Vesc app.
[2025-07-05T10:01:56] Arnau Martinez Casals: You got the right one alredy
[2025-07-05T10:02:47] Arnau Martinez Casals: Its a G300 Or a “RTR”?
[2025-07-05T10:03:12] Arnau Martinez Casals: If its rtr i think its alredy shipped with custom firmware
[2025-07-05T10:03:30] Arnau Martinez Casals: If its G300 it will have to be included
[2025-07-05T10:05:33] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I have already obtained 6.3 and a bug was fixed, with version 5.3 the accelerator remained accelerated after accelerating
[2025-07-05T10:07:43] Arnau Martinez Casals: It doesnt to be needed, you can also do it with a ham Or something but you have to be careful to not damage thread of the new axle, the old one you can hit hardly. Take out the lock washer and hit out.
[2025-07-05T10:09:43] Arnau Martinez Casals: Its more difficult to install the new one witthout damaging the thread. Its need to be a calm work. Carefully with rubber ham
[2025-07-05T10:10:49] Arnau Martinez Casals: Ive done several like these…
[2025-07-05T10:11:42] Arnau Martinez Casals: It doesnt
[2025-07-05T10:12:07] Arnau Martinez Casals: Not all accelerator works well
[2025-07-05T10:12:52] Arnau Martinez Casals: My nami rides with 5.3 RTR and theres no issues
[2025-07-05T10:13:28] Arnau Martinez Casals: Also ambrosini firmware is 5.3. Probably very similar
[2025-07-05T10:14:49] Arnau Martinez Casals: The only issues i have now is mosfet temp. I have to redo conf. And try out

[2025-07-05T13:26:10] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: You know what foot to be
[2025-07-05T13:30:31] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I think the motor detects low voltage. I hit the controller and the red light blinks 6 times.
[2025-07-05T13:33:37] Paolo ⁭: I think 70-75 is the best
[2025-07-05T13:33:50] Paolo ⁭: 80h is double magnet not really suce
[2025-07-05T13:37:27] Yamal: 70 getting hot faster
[2025-07-05T13:41:53] Paolo ⁭: Not really big difference
[2025-07-05T13:42:16] Paolo ⁭: Double magnet not good for Foc
[2025-07-05T13:46:15] Yamal: So, 70H and 80H motors handle the same temperatures and amps? And are the 70H better for Vesc controllers? Well, that's good to know! For the next time I have to buy motors.
[2025-07-05T14:02:39] Paolo ⁭: Technically 80h has more torque and since it is bigger it can dissipate more heat. But unfortunately ly choose to make 80h with double 40h magnet, so it's not really good. 70-75-90h are unique magnet instead
[2025-07-05T14:20:28] Yamal: Thanks
[2025-07-05T14:20:34] Yamal: Good to know !

[2025-07-05T19:47:27] haku: fuck ill put it on credit
[2025-07-05T19:51:36] Rose: Hey there Samsara, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-07-05T19:51:44] haku: thats bs you can only buy 1
[2025-07-05T19:52:10] haku: but theres multiple listings by the same vendor
[2025-07-05T19:52:26] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: <photos/photo_24458@05-07-2025_19-52-26.jpg>
[2025-07-05T19:55:07] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Is this a compatible product with potential to drive 1500W direct fatbike front hub and regenerate to the 13S battery?
[2025-07-05T19:55:25] haku: this one you can buy multiples but idk what magnet and winding. i bet 16x4 50h
[2025-07-05T19:55:32] haku: <photos/photo_24459@05-07-2025_19-55-32.jpg>
[2025-07-05T20:12:43] Matthew: So... I have this throttle. I have 2 of them ive been using. I was just now going to send a link to someone for it and i see it says its a 5v throttle... but ive had it connected to 3.3v. Would I get better results connecting to 5v or does vesc not want 5v with adc?
[2025-07-05T20:17:18] Matthew: Only one motor?? What if you want 3wd
[2025-07-05T20:18:39] haku: there is another vendor that you can buy 10 haha. but its $102. this one is $91. every dollar counts in ali haha
[2025-07-05T20:19:41] 'lekrsu': You can't connect a throttle to 5v into ADC1 or ADC2, that will burn the STM.
[2025-07-05T20:20:16] haku: build me a motor witg tank threads if i knew how to weld
[2025-07-05T20:20:42] 'lekrsu': Broke the threads on yours?
[2025-07-05T20:20:51] Matthew: Nice! And every dollar really counts. Got in so many arguments with my ex. I'll just go buy another one he says on so many things, I said that is beyond the point. I said that money never comes back and when it's a sauce that is fine and not even close to the date and smells proper since his nose was sensitive he say I dont like it im dumping it.
[2025-07-05T20:21:10] haku: no. i just want to build another project with these
[2025-07-05T20:21:15] Matthew: Use 3/32 wire haha
[2025-07-05T20:23:19] Matthew: Like a 10x10 winding haha
[2025-07-05T20:23:58] Matthew: Wouldn't that be a lot of torque? Still learning this stuff
[2025-07-05T20:24:54] Matthew: I remember like maybe 2 years ago when I was getting the itch to get different esc and a custom motor... someone said the thickest wire you can get for high amps
[2025-07-05T20:25:53] haku: same. never seen this 20x3 winding though. seems like they cheaped out on copper and didnt go 22
[2025-07-05T20:26:25] haku: its the turns that gives torque i think
[2025-07-05T20:26:53] 'lekrsu': The total amount, both parallel strands and the turns define your torque
[2025-07-05T20:27:12] 'lekrsu': but the order changes your kV and the current needed to create the torque
[2025-07-05T20:27:43] haku: so what is this 20x3 winding? would it be similar to 22x3?
[2025-07-05T20:27:55] 'lekrsu': It's 20 parallel strands instead of 22
[2025-07-05T20:28:03] 'lekrsu': Just less copper overall, less torque.
[2025-07-05T20:28:11] haku: lame
[2025-07-05T20:28:19] 'lekrsu': Is that ali listing 20x3?
[2025-07-05T20:28:23] haku: yes
[2025-07-05T20:28:30] haku: maybe typo.
[2025-07-05T20:28:46] haku: im gonna have to open and count
[2025-07-05T20:28:47] 'lekrsu': But you don't know the width of the strands
[2025-07-05T20:29:05] haku: let me.check
[2025-07-05T20:29:05] 'lekrsu': Why not just Lonnyo, or will import torture you?
[2025-07-05T20:29:26] haku: dude. these motors dirt cheap. 90 ea
[2025-07-05T20:29:33] 'lekrsu': Truee
[2025-07-05T20:29:40] haku: lonnyo will triple that
[2025-07-05T20:29:51] 'lekrsu': USA based too? damn
[2025-07-05T20:29:55] haku: yes
[2025-07-05T20:29:57] 'lekrsu': Didnt know ali had shipping centers there
[2025-07-05T20:30:03] haku: i think its overstock
[2025-07-05T20:31:20] haku: i would love lonnyo 70h 22x3 but dam. that will be 900
[2025-07-05T20:31:24] haku: or 700
[2025-07-05T20:31:51] 'lekrsu': Tf
[2025-07-05T20:31:57] 'lekrsu': Why so much?
[2025-07-05T20:32:10] haku: because lonnyo
[2025-07-05T20:32:18] 'lekrsu': That's double EU cost of 65H
[2025-07-05T20:32:28] haku: tubeless split rim is already 120 ea
[2025-07-05T20:34:15] Matthew: Lonnyo costs me $330 usd and thats before may... issues with office at the home I sent the motor to about lazy bitch didnt want to check shipping lockers because she just couldn't be bother3d to do her job. I ended up filing lost package. Tuesday the motor the carrier says picked up and being returned to sender. I dont even know if lonnyo went through the trouble to even pay to get it back.... so in essence with the screw up it cost me $660 to get my single 65h 17x4 motor. And the contact says they're not sure how new tarrifs are gonna be
[2025-07-05T20:35:02] Patrick: Tristan sells some Brand new
[2025-07-05T20:35:12] Patrick: 700€
[2025-07-05T20:35:44] haku: i already got my lonnyos too rich for my blood. i considered it but it has a brand on it.
[2025-07-05T20:36:32] haku: if it said haku industries world wide weld you little shits on the brand then i would buy
[2025-07-05T20:40:31] haku: you guys should know by now. im about cheap thrills
[2025-07-05T20:41:02] Dualtron Achilleus: lul whatt
[2025-07-05T20:41:27] Dualtron Achilleus: got my 90h 127mm for "only" 550€
[2025-07-05T20:42:18] haku: estimate. i think i got my 70h in 2023 for 600. now with inflation and tarrif thats what im thinking
[2025-07-05T20:42:42] Matthew: 127mm for opening?
[2025-07-05T20:43:35] Matthew: Its 5mm more, why is the motor double that of a 65h lonnyo ?
[2025-07-05T20:43:44] Dualtron Achilleus: 127mm stator
[2025-07-05T20:44:03] Dualtron Achilleus: unlike CASUAL 110mm stator lonnyo
[2025-07-05T20:44:32] Matthew: Is there a significant difference in performance?
[2025-07-05T20:44:57] Matthew: Like a night and day difference between 65h 22x3 and 65h 17x4?
[2025-07-05T20:45:46] Matthew: What size stator is in older original vsett 10+motor?
[2025-07-05T20:53:00] haku: your 90h is tubeless split? i think the removable motors make it expensive
[2025-07-05T20:53:11] Noname: Can't claim poverty you rich bastard
[2025-07-05T20:54:00] haku: you shut it. if i was rich i wouldve bought it not complaining about buying it
[2025-07-05T20:54:38] haku: i have that ali fomo
[2025-07-05T20:54:49] haku: everytime that timer it gets me
[2025-07-05T20:56:01] Noname: Yeah you would
[2025-07-05T20:56:32] haku: buy these im telling you. good investment
[2025-07-05T20:56:41] haku: haha
[2025-07-05T20:58:05] Noname: Wtf am I gonna use that on?
[2025-07-05T20:58:24] haku: make peak g30.
[2025-07-05T20:58:26] Noname: Spintend where's that 18 fet?
[2025-07-05T21:01:30] haku: big titty amy will deliver. wait and see
[2025-07-05T21:02:27] haku: she knows what the boys want
[2025-07-05T22:22:09] Matthew: Ok, thats something I think i remembered but I bought the 1st unit a year ago and about a month ago bought the same and put on a different scooter and wired to 3.3v and its good. Thank you, good to know
[2025-07-05T22:36:37] 'lekrsu': You can run 4 wheel tc, just sayin'
[2025-07-06T00:10:29] haku: its getting cheaper by the hour.
[2025-07-06T00:11:17] haku: <photos/photo_24462@06-07-2025_00-11-17.jpg>
[2025-07-06T00:21:53] haku: fuck it i got 2 from 2 different vendors. hope it matches 😭
[2025-07-06T00:22:06] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Who has 75h 22/3??
[2025-07-06T00:22:11] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_24463@06-07-2025_00-22-11.jpg>
[2025-07-06T00:22:28] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Wtf I get 80c+ at 400a ?
[2025-07-06T00:22:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And 3-4 min ride?
[2025-07-06T00:23:35] haku: ly motors can take up to 120c make sure you have the right temp sensor setup though
[2025-07-06T00:25:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I checked
[2025-07-06T00:25:49] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's the right one
[2025-07-06T00:26:28] haku: 400a is alot dont you think?
[2025-07-06T00:26:39] haku: im not a pro
[2025-07-06T00:36:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I did 300 on my 60h same winding
[2025-07-06T00:36:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Not even close to that heat
[2025-07-06T00:37:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Cables I used for phases maybe also problem?
[2025-07-06T00:37:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <photos/photo_24465@06-07-2025_00-37-42.jpg>
[2025-07-06T00:40:20] Roland 11x: 400a motor or absolute?
[2025-07-06T00:48:02] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Motor
[2025-07-06T00:48:13] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I think my problem is shit cables
[2025-07-06T00:48:48] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Those aren't meant for motors also motor cable itself is thicker so bottleneck
[2025-07-06T00:55:44] haku: @lekrsu look at these spec sheet. that copper wire diameter normal?
[2025-07-06T00:59:07] Roland 11x: In 75h hub 11 inches, i believe 200-250a motor is more then enough.
[2025-07-06T01:02:31] 'lekrsu': I don't know what lonnyo uses tbh
[2025-07-06T01:02:49] 'lekrsu': Paolo would know this
[2025-07-06T01:03:00] 'lekrsu': Maybe James 😅
[2025-07-06T01:04:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I did 300 on 60h
[2025-07-06T01:04:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also one connector is broken
[2025-07-06T01:13:58] Roland 11x: Its doesnt means its right.
[2025-07-06T01:14:37] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Weren't the same bad results
[2025-07-06T01:14:43] Roland 11x: 60h around 150 to 180 motor and around 50-60a current as i know
[2025-07-06T01:15:37] Roland 11x: Ive opened 200a phase on my rear motor and didnt connected the front one Around 4-5 kmh and the motor died
[2025-07-06T01:16:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No fwk
[2025-07-06T01:16:25] Roland 11x: With the F12 i had 170a phase rear, 130a front and the resault was incredible
[2025-07-06T01:16:30] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I do no filed weakening
[2025-07-06T01:16:46] skrtt: Do it 😎
[2025-07-06T01:16:58] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Not yet need to re wire phase
[2025-07-06T01:17:09] skrtt: U have spare battery A for fw?
[2025-07-06T01:17:13] Roland 11x: Intresting, maybe i will learn something new over here :)
[2025-07-06T01:17:22] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: They are shit cables that are getting my motor too hot
[2025-07-06T01:17:31] skrtt: What esc u have?
[2025-07-06T01:17:47] Roland 11x: 75450 shitsky 😁
[2025-07-06T01:17:58] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No fwk is better for acceleration (off the line ) if use lot phase also better for vesc and battery
[2025-07-06T01:19:52] Roland 11x: When i open more then 300a motor in mine im getting little crushes wgen pulls full throttle from start, only god knows why.
[2025-07-06T01:20:48] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Observer problem and erpm sensorless problem
[2025-07-06T01:20:52] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Can be either
[2025-07-06T01:21:47] Roland 11x: Battery can push 700a Motor stays cold because 8000w nominal 310n.m middle strong motor. Only vesc limits me to 300a phase for smooth start. Sad story. It was 200a phase but. I played with the software till got 300a to work well but couldnt ooen more because of the reasons ive mantioned
[2025-07-06T01:22:32] Roland 11x: Tried all the observers, But the secind thing you said may be, im really sensorles at this one.
[2025-07-06T01:23:02] Roland 11x: Ways to fix it?
[2025-07-06T01:38:57] skrtt: What motor?
[2025-07-06T01:40:14] skrtt: U plan on changing to smaller one,
[2025-07-06T01:42:23] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm talking about people that have that problem but they are sensored
[2025-07-06T01:54:17] Noname: That's gotta be hall wire
[2025-07-06T01:54:37] Noname: .5mm 😆
[2025-07-06T01:57:49] Roland 11x: If im sensirless and i got this problem so? What can it be?
[2025-07-06T01:58:05] Roland 11x: Caofen f80 off road Stock motor

[2025-07-06T03:02:52] haku: oh thats fine
[2025-07-06T03:02:55] Noname: A fucking link would help
[2025-07-06T03:03:29] Noname: Yeah .5mm phase would instantly explode with 100w lol

[2025-07-06T04:38:41] skrtt: Maybe i have to change the handlebars cuz mine have 9° down angle
[2025-07-06T04:38:56] skrtt: If i change it to normal handlebars maybe it helps
[2025-07-06T05:05:59] haku: oh this is what those surron boys are talking about. https://youtu.be/jfcbRtK774o?si=Xa2dWjDxxMQW7dOm

[2025-07-06T08:14:19] Yamal: Today, of the two attempts, I was only able to fully accelerator and hold it for a few seconds on the second attempt. I'm still not comfortable at 100%, and the acceleration was more or less gradual for added safety! But yes! Today is a day of celebration 🎉🎊

[2025-07-06T14:20:03] Yamal: I think I can reach a higher top speed... I wasn't at 84v either, and my settings aren't at their safe maximums! Little by little, the important thing is to enjoy it! Hehe, but of course, with 20s, the limit is close.
[2025-07-06T14:38:19] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: We want to see the limit 🤣🚀

She says hold on one minute and comes back with 3 jars and 6 seeds in each one. She says its a donation thing but we dont expect it. He gave her a few bucks

[2025-07-06T21:55:12] Matthew: I feel that so much. Its almost like the pev laws around the world. Some of them laws are just absolutely bs. Government "we want to go green". "OH shit, now we dont get to rob people blind taxing gasoline... make up some new fees at registration and name them something odd and customers won't question". Get an ebike or scooter.... 250 watts like seriously?

[2025-07-06T22:00:55] Noname: Kinda yeah
[2025-07-06T22:03:49] Matthew: There was some v8 sandrail that showed up at these big sand dunes that banchie 4wheeler, 250 and 450 dirt bikes and not one person was making it to the top. Person in sandrail probably told his buddy hold my beer lol. He practically idled up that hill and to top it off there was like a little cliff face and he just blipped the gas like twice and he was up and over that came back down and parked lol

[2025-07-07T05:42:37] Yamal: This is a bit sad, it really seems like they finally got a good controller, I don't know why they disappear, but a project with them would have been nice

[2025-07-07T06:48:17] Yamal: have a beautiful day
[2025-07-07T06:49:12] haku: lawdy

[2025-07-07T06:54:42] haku: i wish i could
[2025-07-07T06:56:18] haku: what i was wondering about is why seven vescs also died
[2025-07-07T06:56:42] haku: and the answer is....... fardriver 😭
[2025-07-07T06:57:12] haku: murika should support thier own. sad
[2025-07-07T06:57:21] Yamal: I don't understand why it has such high peak watts" carrying only 300A total battery
[2025-07-07T06:57:39] Jason: fuck fardriver

[2025-07-07T09:32:53] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I'm leaving for work this afternoon. Let's continue.
[2025-07-07T09:33:07] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <photos/photo_24487@07-07-2025_09-33-07.jpg>
[2025-07-07T09:33:10] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: the km/h are not correct
[2025-07-07T10:36:54] ausias: you sure??? jajajaa
[2025-07-07T10:55:40] Dualtron Achilleus: 0/100 in above 8sec nice!
[2025-07-07T11:01:03] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, sure 100x100 ☺️☺️
[2025-07-07T11:02:34] Yamal: we have to lower that figure!
[2025-07-07T11:08:44] Yamal: But very happy only 250 phase on 33/2!
[2025-07-07T11:08:48] Yamal: I need a good app for acceleration and to practice a little so I don't lose grip, also all this is on the way to work xD
[2025-07-07T11:17:07] ausias: with the g300 Rober says its like 170 top speed xddd
[2025-07-07T11:17:48] ausias: why you dont use traction control?
[2025-07-07T11:18:51] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah you can push to 350easy
[2025-07-07T11:18:56] Dualtron Achilleus: On 33/2
[2025-07-07T11:24:49] Yamal: Because lose power 😆
[2025-07-07T11:25:13] ausias: i didnt know
[2025-07-07T11:28:23] Yamal: From what I could see at the beginning of installing the new engines, the traction control reduced the watts.
[2025-07-07T11:33:01] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah you loos a bit of torque using traction, but you can use gaz a lot easier when turning
[2025-07-07T11:37:20] Yamal: waiting for your projects to be completed!
[2025-07-07T11:40:22] Yamal: @Dualtron_Achillleus @xoausias @skrt15
[2025-07-07T11:41:00] Yamal: Dualtron/Nami/dualtron ? :)

[2025-07-07T11:54:06] Dualtron Achilleus: Batterie comming this week i hope
[2025-07-07T12:06:51] Yamal: I really want to try hope
[2025-07-07T12:06:57] Yamal: Nice battery man ;)
[2025-07-07T12:07:03] Yamal: 22s11p?
[2025-07-07T12:09:49] Dualtron Achilleus: 21s11
[2025-07-07T12:10:00] Dualtron Achilleus: Nonmoney for 22xd
[2025-07-07T12:20:18] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Bongo

[2025-07-07T12:23:59] ausias: @AYO744 in your mantis you had hope?
[2025-07-07T12:24:12] ausias: wich ones??? ive got a bad review of the tech3
[2025-07-07T12:33:02] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If I had hope in Mantis, now I have hope again. Before, I had Magura pincer, Logan bomb.
[2025-07-07T12:34:12] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Tober doesn't have a 450 phase, I talk to him some days
[2025-07-07T12:35:25] Rogerio Figueiredo: Guys I still need help for this ant 30s bms with 22s pack
[2025-07-07T12:35:25] Rogerio Figueiredo: <photos/photo_24489@07-07-2025_12-35-25.jpg>
[2025-07-07T12:37:04] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I have the same
[2025-07-07T12:37:40] Patrick: If LY motor very sure problem there, the once for 10inch have offset rims
[2025-07-07T12:38:24] Patrick: Few big design mistakes on the small LY wouldn't be a surprise if it's the same for the 11inch one
[2025-07-07T12:43:19] ausias: how are they going
[2025-07-07T12:43:24] ausias: wich ones you have
[2025-07-07T12:54:21] AG.racing: yes even on 11" engines the rims are offset towards the brake side
[2025-07-07T12:57:45] Patrick: Ly is special
[2025-07-07T13:31:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Hey. Vesc disconnecting when push throttle
[2025-07-07T13:33:56] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: now Hope
[2025-07-07T13:47:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Does the same at motor detection
[2025-07-07T13:51:59] Nobrrr: Which of you have the most powerful scooters? Are there any 30kW builds?
[2025-07-07T13:52:10] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 150 batery

[2025-07-07T15:48:09] Yamal: <video_file>
[2025-07-07T15:58:31] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 🚀
[2025-07-07T16:30:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Pahse ?
[2025-07-07T16:40:46] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 250
[2025-07-07T16:41:11] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: So I'm exaggerating
[2025-07-07T16:41:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm trying to run 75h on 300a
[2025-07-07T16:41:25] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 120batt
[2025-07-07T16:44:01] Dualtron Achilleus: 300A careful on 22/3 you can burn it
[2025-07-07T16:45:02] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But I said to 75200 do 300a on the 60h and was fine
[2025-07-07T16:45:19] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Maybe it didn't give him 300a because stock phase wire
[2025-07-07T17:11:29] skrtt: For 70/75h 33x2 350phase is good?
[2025-07-07T17:21:38] Finn: 😊
[2025-07-07T17:23:13] Dualtron Achilleus: Seems weird that you reach that much no?
[2025-07-07T17:24:31] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: That's what I'm saying maybe because was thin pahses it didn't really have me 300 to motor idnno
[2025-07-07T17:44:38] Dualtron Achilleus: So phase were hot
[2025-07-07T17:47:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Didn't check tbh
[2025-07-07T17:47:53] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But motor never choked or some
[2025-07-07T17:52:37] Paolo ⁭: This current will pass only for less than half of second
[2025-07-07T17:52:56] Paolo ⁭: If you go uphill you will definitely burn it
[2025-07-07T18:49:44] Mirono escooters: Flipsky 75100 V2 (Yes I know, flipsky, I'm just using what I have) Can ride fine, then just stop, not turn off, try again, and motor just vibrate, doesn't drive, even with a push start (has halls) Anyone a clue?
[2025-07-07T19:17:16] Mirono escooters: Absolutely makes 0 sense Rides fine, then breaks itself when I pause. Will just vibrate and not drive. Write settings (not change any, just write) and it will move again fine. Pause, and the problem starts over again This is the only way I can fix it and reproduce the issue lol
[2025-07-07T19:21:32] Yamal: you had x12, apart from other good vesc, right?
[2025-07-07T19:41:44] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Try reinstall firmware
[2025-07-07T19:42:55] Mirono escooters: Already on a clean flash
[2025-07-07T19:43:57] Mirono escooters: Somehow, it works fine on lower amps. It is only when going over a set amount of phase, it will do this behaviour Absolutely ridiculous
[2025-07-07T19:44:16] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Mine now has problem with staying connected to bt when ride and motor detection
[2025-07-07T19:44:18] Mirono escooters: It's not the amps that are the issue, as I can go and drive around with throttle without the script for pedals. But that is not legal
[2025-07-07T19:44:30] Mirono escooters: Noise on BT, add ceramic cap
[2025-07-07T19:44:30] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Observer maybe?
[2025-07-07T19:44:36] Mirono escooters: Good call actually
[2025-07-07T19:44:53] Mirono escooters: Just weird it would stay broken until I write the motor config again. Not change values. Just write config.
[2025-07-07T19:44:54] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But before new motor was working fine
[2025-07-07T19:45:06] Mirono escooters: Pedalling shouldn't break it. If anything, the throttle should
[2025-07-07T19:45:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Maybe try to motor detection use PC ?
[2025-07-07T19:45:09] Mirono escooters: Ow
[2025-07-07T19:46:45] Mirono escooters: Didn't fix it. Good call though
[2025-07-07T19:47:02] Mirono escooters: Absolutely driving me nuts. Something with the higher amps is fucking up my lisp script with the PAS
[2025-07-07T19:47:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Don't fix what ?
[2025-07-07T19:47:25] Mirono escooters: My issue
[2025-07-07T19:47:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ah you already tried
[2025-07-07T19:47:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: U fast
[2025-07-07T19:48:13] Mirono escooters: I'm on bike hehe
[2025-07-07T19:48:35] Mirono escooters: It has to be something in the lisp script. Something with pedalling and amps. Good thing I absolutely suck at reading code
[2025-07-07T19:48:51] Mirono escooters: I've pinned it down to high amps and pedalling
[2025-07-07T20:12:25] Marius: 😳😳😳
[2025-07-07T20:12:48] Marius: not real speed tho right
[2025-07-07T20:15:48] haku: holy fuck. 37kw. what battery setup again?

[2025-07-07T20:19:49] Yamal: But why , what you mean ? Can’t push more than 300A phase in 22/3
[2025-07-07T20:20:03] Yamal: New Ly engines generation ?
[2025-07-07T20:20:36] haku: i want to get 1 first and measure and look at quality
[2025-07-07T20:20:39] Yamal: by the winding?
[2025-07-07T20:39:43] Arnau Martinez Casals: This 75h single on 200a phase 100batt

[2025-07-07T20:40:19] Arnau Martinez Casals: On first rt data motor sensor was on 10k not on 100k thats why show only 6 grades
[2025-07-07T20:41:05] Arnau Martinez Casals: This is single motor on 200a phase no overheat over 85/90 grades
[2025-07-07T20:41:27] Yamal: Pretty nice
[2025-07-07T20:42:40] Yamal: 86kmh//// 10.000w///36 fet temp
[2025-07-07T20:42:52] Yamal: Crazy good for Daly
[2025-07-07T20:43:05] Yamal: Do you have some picture of this scooter
[2025-07-07T20:43:12] Yamal: 75h rear..
[2025-07-07T20:43:14] Yamal: Dream
[2025-07-07T20:44:59] Yamal: Something like that on my G2 would be great, James' e-scooter will come out something similar to that.
[2025-07-07T20:45:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Single motor?
[2025-07-07T20:46:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 85-90 my motor lowering power

[2025-07-07T20:46:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: That's why I'm a bit disappointed from the 75h
[2025-07-07T20:46:58] Yamal: You say 22/3 ?

[2025-07-07T20:51:50] Arnau Martinez Casals: No but its seems a rental scooter, police don’t look at it
[2025-07-07T21:09:52] cihan: Are screws holding the disc rotor on ninebot scooters m5x0.8? Any ideas?
[2025-07-07T21:21:30] haku: dam long gone are the days that you get a $700 laotie ti30 deals. never seen it since
[2025-07-07T21:24:17] Yamal: everything is getting more and more expensive
[2025-07-07T21:25:02] Yamal: That's why the second-hand market is so interesting
[2025-07-07T21:26:58] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <video_file>
[2025-07-07T21:27:00] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: There is less left
[2025-07-07T21:32:09] Yamal: Nami Viper Competition, we missed him a lot!
[2025-07-07T21:38:29] Matthew: I was just saying this in a different group on fb
[2025-07-07T21:38:50] Matthew: Very nice!
[2025-07-07T21:42:01] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yeah I did connect everything well the problem if software not hardware
[2025-07-07T21:42:24] Matthew: Yes. Im running 90amps battery and 260 phase. 270phase something was not happy when I went full throttle from a stop. Throttle in instant noise instant release. Dropped to 240 and was nice. Went up to 260 and its been great
[2025-07-07T21:50:13] Noname: How the hell, 200 battery 300 phase and it only hits 220 phase when accelerating off the line
[2025-07-07T21:57:23] Matthew: I came up with i didnt have hw no limits firmware and I was stuck at 150amps phase even on the 85250 and once I got no hw limits the scooter is a different animal
[2025-07-07T22:08:50] haku: your motor needs more buddy
[2025-07-07T22:09:49] haku: do you have temp sensor on motor Noname
[2025-07-07T22:12:41] haku: i did this once. the wind blew it away and broke it
[2025-07-07T22:17:25] Finn: <photos/photo_24501@07-07-2025_22-17-25.jpg>
[2025-07-07T22:17:44] haku: good idea. your smarter than me
[2025-07-07T22:18:08] haku: i was devastated when it happened
[2025-07-07T22:27:30] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-07-07T22:28:35] Noname: Yeah
[2025-07-07T22:30:07] haku: motor stays cool?
[2025-07-07T22:30:40] haku: qs motors are paired with far fars. dont do it. it will end our partership
[2025-07-07T22:46:35] Noname: Its weird. Temp increases instantly with throttle idk if its coil heat or weird electric phenomenon. But I hit like 70 ripping down a highway on a hot day. Prob would have went higher but got into the city traffic
[2025-07-07T22:47:23] Noname: Its a kyt-83 sensor. I want to try ferrofliluid even to stop the air raid siren noise
[2025-07-07T22:47:42] Noname: Its fucking loud at 40-45
[2025-07-07T22:52:22] Rose: Hey there riekcn, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-07-07T22:57:14] haku: idk what that sensor is
[2025-07-07T22:59:47] Noname: Not an ntc
[2025-07-07T23:00:50] haku: does vesc work well with this type of sensor?
[2025-07-07T23:07:28] Noname: The ntc stays steady temp. Idk what this one is doing half the time
[2025-07-07T23:12:32] Rose: Hey there riekcn, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-07-07T23:13:56] riekcn ordicjr.: Do you know which version of the vesc should I buy for a ninebot g2? And will I have all the functions, for example the horn or the indicator? And do I have to change anything?
[2025-07-07T23:26:18] Noname: God damn its hotter than a doorknob at a brothel on nickle night outside
[2025-07-07T23:44:57] haku: if you touch it its not yea
[2025-07-08T03:24:19] Matthew: If you're in usa ^^
[2025-07-08T03:32:21] Matthew: Are you using the factory battery?
[2025-07-08T03:33:58] Noname: Restored though
[2025-07-08T03:37:45] Matthew: https://a.co/d/1NPEg5m I use this brake handle and others will have to let you know about your left brake handle if the factory one is easy to wire up.
[2025-07-08T03:40:50] Matthew: I use left and right of the brake handle and theyre variable so works great for regen if you're using cable brakes. Im using cable disc. But I went to a bicycle store and got a pretty nice cable kit thats so smooth. I used sintered metal pads and a hardened 140mm rotor and it seriously is easy to front flip with 1 finger ☝️
[2025-07-08T03:41:35] Matthew: This is a product that spintend sells that expands your options
[2025-07-08T03:43:13] Matthew: I personally like Spintend single 85150 ubox. Basically your battery is gonna dictate what it is capable of. People are running 13kw output on 72v.
[2025-07-08T03:44:28] Matthew: This price on screenshot includes Bluetooth module and a 120amps fuse.
[2025-07-08T03:54:37] Matthew: Yeah, thats the only thing... but it is $200 less than when I bought mine..
[2025-07-08T03:55:42] Matthew: I kinda feel i should have bought another g30lp when Walmart was selling for $250
[2025-07-08T03:56:29] Noname: What
[2025-07-08T03:56:39] Noname: Oh lp fuck that
[2025-07-08T03:56:47] Matthew: I've really really really been wanting one of them dampers. Do they work well?
[2025-07-08T03:57:17] Noname: 400$ or wait till marketplace has one with a flat tire for 150
[2025-07-08T03:58:09] Matthew: Statorade is pretty good.
[2025-07-08T03:58:09] Noname: <photos/photo_24505@08-07-2025_03-58-09.jpg>
[2025-07-08T04:00:02] Noname: Id hope so they're like 500$
[2025-07-08T04:00:58] Noname: I have some in my ebike. I should say I have a lot in my ebike lol prob need to take some out. Or motor just cooks with 5kw on a 750w idk
[2025-07-08T04:02:07] Matthew: Yeah, well at least it feels that way. I think $50+ shipping 🤦‍♂️
[2025-07-08T04:02:46] Matthew: I can send you a few drops
[2025-07-08T04:02:59] Matthew: Did 2 motors
[2025-07-08T04:03:34] Matthew: But jk for sending that little bit. Feel bad to throw it away.
[2025-07-08T04:04:01] Matthew: Oh
[2025-07-08T04:05:16] Noname: I put like 4ml or whatever in a 12" hub motor
[2025-07-08T04:05:51] Noname: Its 35$ on Amazon for statorade
[2025-07-08T04:07:12] Matthew: I would overheat and get a temp cut way before id finish the 6 miles if riding hard. Now I can drive pretty hard and motor temp if getting high just cruising the temp goes down well on them lonnyo 65h
[2025-07-08T04:07:24] haku: statorade is a scam you fool
[2025-07-08T04:08:16] Unknown: no it keeps the motor cool
[2025-07-08T04:08:18] Matthew: I was thinking synthetic mobile 1 would work... but i aint brave enough to see if it gets ruined
[2025-07-08T04:08:35] Unknown: or cooler than without
[2025-07-08T04:09:03] haku: ive heard different. it seals air gaps and destroys magnets
[2025-07-08T04:09:05] Noname: No its not dickhead
[2025-07-08T04:09:58] Matthew: Makes a significant difference. If motor starts getting HOT reducing speed a bit for a couple minutes it will drop from 100°c to 70° in 2-3 minutes
[2025-07-08T04:10:03] Noname: Prob not good for a 100mph motor no
[2025-07-08T04:10:06] haku: ask these racers. they dont use em.
[2025-07-08T04:10:39] Matthew: Lol. They got liquid cooling dont they?
[2025-07-08T04:10:49] haku: nah
[2025-07-08T04:10:58] haku: air cooled
[2025-07-08T04:11:18] Matthew: My vesc is liquid cooled 😎
[2025-07-08T04:11:58] Matthew: Its on a track through. Like I uncapped my turbos air filter at the drag strip...
[2025-07-08T04:12:21] haku: i wanted to say the dom torreto line. ask these racers. it doesnt matter if you win by an inch or a mile. winning is winning
[2025-07-08T04:12:39] Matthew: BahaHahaha
[2025-07-08T04:12:45] Matthew: Love it
[2025-07-08T04:13:05] Matthew: Spoon turbos and stuff
[2025-07-08T04:13:53] Matthew: I forgot what that Jap club had them saying but Honda s2000 ✊️💦💦💦
[2025-07-08T04:14:28] Matthew: I still to this day haven't had the pleasure of driving that go kart

[2025-07-08T04:26:39] Matthew: Derf and my buddy Tuning Tricks were in Florida. Amongst some other tuners Imo them 2 are some of the best engine tuners in the world. People fly these guys around to be at the racetrack to tune while racing.
[2025-07-08T04:28:04] Matthew: The dude ireson motorsports was another phenomenal professional at basically anything automotive. He restored some big wood trolley.

[2025-07-08T06:12:45] Yamal: 40pl or 50 pl
[2025-07-08T06:12:47] Yamal: But
[2025-07-08T06:12:58] Yamal: For me p45b is the dream too
[2025-07-08T06:13:04] haku: 10p 50pl is insane
[2025-07-08T06:13:20] haku: can you even use all that amps

[2025-07-08T06:16:14] haku: boys let me just tell you what the future might look like. i gazed into my crystal ball. im thinking higher voltage like 30s/40s on torque motors might be the most optimal
[2025-07-08T06:16:40] Yamal: <photos/photo_24517@08-07-2025_06-16-40.jpg>
[2025-07-08T06:16:43] haku: like 40s5p 50pl
[2025-07-08T06:17:56] haku: higher voltage. better efficieny. look at the range on tiny euc batteries
[2025-07-08T06:18:28] haku: amps is heat boys. just saying

[2025-07-08T07:03:27] skrtt: Why?
[2025-07-08T07:03:37] haku: varg and euc already proven efficient
[2025-07-08T07:03:45] skrtt: I think the opposite its better
[2025-07-08T07:04:02] skrtt: Speed motors with tones of amps
[2025-07-08T07:04:04] skrtt: :p
[2025-07-08T07:04:20] Yamal: 33/2 is really amazing
[2025-07-08T07:04:34] haku: we will see what te future holds. my bet is higher voltage when the tech is available
[2025-07-08T07:04:38] skrtt: How much discharge u have?
[2025-07-08T07:04:42] Yamal: I only use 250A per controller
[2025-07-08T07:04:52] Yamal: Imagine 400A
[2025-07-08T07:04:54] skrtt: Battery?
[2025-07-08T07:04:57] Yamal: 150
[2025-07-08T07:05:12] Yamal: And is really Fun
[2025-07-08T07:05:14] skrtt: How u got that much watts then
[2025-07-08T07:05:25] skrtt: Math not mathing
[2025-07-08T07:05:28] Yamal: I ask yesterday
[2025-07-08T07:05:41] Yamal: But anybody replay
[2025-07-08T07:06:23] skrtt: There is a guy with elongated thunder. He posted on fb that his project will be double 80h 66x2 at 22s
[2025-07-08T07:06:34] skrtt: Unknown controller
[2025-07-08T07:06:51] Yamal: 66/2?
[2025-07-08T07:06:56] Yamal: What that mean ?
[2025-07-08T07:06:57] skrtt: 1 sorry
[2025-07-08T07:07:06] skrtt: 66x1
[2025-07-08T07:07:20] skrtt: Winding
[2025-07-08T07:07:27] haku: im a noob when it comes to these motors. i just have a feeling that higher voltage is where its headed
[2025-07-08T07:07:32] Yamal: Never listen before
[2025-07-08T07:07:35] Yamal: Speed ?
[2025-07-08T07:07:42] skrtt: Yesss
[2025-07-08T07:07:51] skrtt: Raphael have them
[2025-07-08T07:08:16] skrtt: Wont try to write its full name out of respect
[2025-07-08T07:08:38] skrtt: Maybe
[2025-07-08T07:08:59] skrtt: I think this is evolving very fast
[2025-07-08T07:09:27] haku: specially with denser cells now.
[2025-07-08T07:09:34] skrtt: But i also think bigger tension will be the future
[2025-07-08T07:09:46] skrtt: Maybe prismatic cells
[2025-07-08T07:10:00] skrtt: But they are big
[2025-07-08T07:10:17] haku: no. cylindrical is what im talking about. the tabless cells
[2025-07-08T07:10:34] haku: 21700s
[2025-07-08T07:10:35] skrtt: Wth are tabless cells
[2025-07-08T07:10:47] skrtt: Duracell?
[2025-07-08T07:11:16] haku: not sure what the science is on those but jp40 50pl 40pl jp30 all tabless
[2025-07-08T07:12:27] skrtt: The thing with prismatic cells is that u only need 1/2p to have good ah and A from what i know
[2025-07-08T07:12:31] haku: jp30 is 18650 my bad
[2025-07-08T07:12:42] skrtt: So everything else is series
[2025-07-08T07:13:19] haku: but its huge. takes up alot of space. if you get them in pouch form they bloat
[2025-07-08T07:13:39] skrtt: True
[2025-07-08T07:18:44] Yamal: After the summer, I'll go up a gear with the configuration, but I still don't see the need to increase the amps on the front motor, honestly. I don't know how people with 400A phase can get the most out of their scooters, maybe always with traction control?
[2025-07-08T07:22:49] haku: 400 phase on 85/250 possible?
[2025-07-08T07:23:58] skrtt: Just tune the rear to max
[2025-07-08T07:24:04] skrtt: First
[2025-07-08T07:24:26] skrtt: Then go brrrrrr with front :p

[2025-07-08T07:26:54] skrtt: How many?
[2025-07-08T07:39:47] Yamal: Yes
[2025-07-08T07:39:55] Yamal: Now using 300A total
[2025-07-08T07:40:05] Yamal: Back to 350A ? XD
[2025-07-08T07:40:23] Yamal: I don’t want go up to my nominal
[2025-07-08T07:40:58] Yamal: to take care of my battery,,, maybe 400 now and then for fun

[2025-07-09T03:36:11] ausias: Will be the best
[2025-07-09T03:36:15] skrtt: But i think from 75 to 80 will be a huge step

[2025-07-09T03:57:06] haku: no
[2025-07-09T03:57:28] haku: what fardriver you get?
[2025-07-09T04:04:26] skrtt: <photos/photo_24545@09-07-2025_04-04-26.jpg>
[2025-07-09T04:04:31] skrtt: No steering wheel
[2025-07-09T04:05:12] haku: whut lol
[2025-07-09T04:05:49] haku: tesla self drive. its very good now
[2025-07-09T04:06:18] haku: back then it was shit
[2025-07-09T04:33:22] Matthew: I've had a few. Im building now on a ninebot max g30p. I have a g30lp thats been a disastrous test-bed over the past year or so. Newb type disastrous. I had a single and also dual motor setup with vsett 10+ motors on 85150. 1 controller fried on me and I bricked the other one months later. Was using 85150 for a while with a lonnyo 65h 22x3 motor. Had 18s until I ruined external pack. So 16s all this year. Now a few months ago grabbed me a 65h 17x4 motor. I have no interest in going over 50mph on these escooters... put the power and more in a caged gokart and sign me up but otherwise 55mph is about my nope speed. I now have 85250 and a 100/100 lite. And a yume y11+
[2025-07-09T04:34:52] skrtt: I like torque better that speed
[2025-07-09T04:35:11] skrtt: So i get u
[2025-07-09T04:35:15] Matthew: G30lp is going to be 52v 40amps battery on 100/100 light with single vsett motor. G30p will be 85250 with speedforks
[2025-07-09T04:35:40] skrtt: Why not dual?
[2025-07-09T04:36:23] Matthew: 85250 is a bit overkill for 65h 17x4 with 16s... but i bought it to be able to power my yume when that time comes.
[2025-07-09T04:37:07] skrtt: I like that yume frame
[2025-07-09T04:37:13] skrtt: Can u put big motors?
[2025-07-09T04:38:17] Matthew: I dont like dual... ive tried on g30 and on yume y11. Both of them tried to kill me. Everytime I almost had a bad accident was from the front wheel trying to throw me into the ground. Dual vsett ran 18s 55amps battery per motor using 2- 85150 controllers
[2025-07-09T04:39:32] Matthew: Yes, my rear opening i think is 150mm because theres washers taking up the extra space on the axles. And I want to put a big magnet high amps rwd build
[2025-07-09T04:40:01] Matthew: But I don't have anything to measure
[2025-07-09T04:40:27] Matthew: <photos/photo_24542@09-07-2025_03-04-09.jpg>
[2025-07-09T04:48:27] Matthew: He was just asking for biggest bang for the buck with the least amount of confusion possible. From random fardriver research, very brief... sounded like the best bet for this dude. He says he a mechanic so he can follow diagrams but he said Iike least programming possible. Seen fardriver enter some values and then put it to self learn and go for a ride. Then it says you can fine tune for more phase. And hes running 48v and I suppose he said his battery is 35amps because I told him fardriver has 2 lower power models that should be self explanatory. He wasnt looking for fast. He is just trying to get a bit more acceleration and range and if field weakening is available that hed welcome a bit higher top speed.
[2025-07-09T05:02:16] haku: $80 motors just arrived. doesnt look promising. doesnt look like 60h.
[2025-07-09T05:02:37] Noname: Dang shipping faster than that wind
[2025-07-09T05:02:51] haku: ships from US
[2025-07-09T05:03:13] haku: if this is 50h ill be pissed
[2025-07-09T05:04:16] Noname: Would cover to cover measurememt be close?
[2025-07-09T05:04:49] haku: no idea. ill open later or tomorow and measure magnets
[2025-07-09T05:05:29] Noname: Quick look my segway was like that
[2025-07-09T05:05:44] haku: fuck it ill open and double check
[2025-07-09T05:06:03] Noname: Yeah you open that motor you dirty boy
[2025-07-09T05:07:04] Matthew: How big are the magnets with that huge stator?
[2025-07-09T05:07:19] Noname: Idk mabey 30 lol
[2025-07-09T05:07:41] Noname: Thing sucks it just heats
[2025-07-09T05:08:21] Matthew: Oh, damn.
[2025-07-09T05:09:14] Noname: Stock people complain about heat and remove the rear fender lol
[2025-07-09T05:14:47] haku: 60h whew
[2025-07-09T05:15:39] haku: <video_file>
[2025-07-09T05:27:28] haku: now that i know. time to stock up boys
[2025-07-09T05:27:42] haku: these are once in a moonlight deals boys
[2025-07-09T05:29:04] Noname: Oh dual magnets
[2025-07-09T05:29:07] Noname: Not good
[2025-07-09T05:29:09] Matthew: Each side of the axle has these washers and I think the dropout opening on the motor is 142mm
[2025-07-09T05:30:17] skrtt: I think 65h fits
[2025-07-09T05:32:45] haku: doesnt matter. 100bucks shipped
[2025-07-09T05:32:54] Matthew: I think lonnyo has a fairly big magnet i thing 75h
[2025-07-09T05:32:59] haku: now its $116
[2025-07-09T05:33:28] haku: i can see the hate and jealousy right now
[2025-07-09T05:34:10] haku: ill open the other one too just to be sure.
[2025-07-09T05:34:49] Matthew: Not sure
[2025-07-09T05:35:59] Matthew: Im honestly clueless on how that performance would be. These strong 65h guys impress the heck out of me
[2025-07-09T05:36:11] haku: 70h 142mm ly will fit
[2025-07-09T05:36:41] haku: thats was my first "project" on 12 tires.
[2025-07-09T05:37:25] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-07-09T05:38:21] haku: yams i can still finish the supreme laotie. battery i still have never used. i just need more of these cheapy 60h motors
[2025-07-09T05:39:26] Matthew: Im confused with the way lonnyo advertises on their website. Cause 1 area say 70h. Another says 75h. And in the same page 75h but 170mm opening
[2025-07-09T05:39:50] haku: yams im telling you nothing will beat this. best build so far.
[2025-07-09T05:40:07] haku: better ask the seller

[2025-07-09T06:00:01] Matthew: I had the motor shipped to my old roommate. He has other family and friends do the same thing since his apartment complex has a really nice locker system setup so there's no worries of stuff being stolen. He told me he didnt get a locker code like he always does for the packages. Next day he went to talk to the office and bitch worker decided she's just gonna close early. He asked her on Saturday and she says she'll check. He told me she couldn't be bothered to do her job and open the lockers to see if a package was there. She never responded until Tues afternoon. By then a lost package was filed. Come to find out ups just went straight to the lockers where my package was and had it on a return trip to China at 6am. I wanted to take an Uber to just got punch that cunt in her face
[2025-07-09T06:02:18] Matthew: Glad youre getting better. Good thing youre in pretty good shape otherwise accident could have been even worse. And body seems to have a muscle memory to grow quicker. I can go from can't stand for a full 8 hrs onto feeling pretty good about the muscle build in like eh, 1.5 Months max.
[2025-07-09T06:03:40] Matthew: Saying im built like anatoly is kinda a misrepresented example but ibe never got huge bulk... just build and lean

[2025-07-09T06:10:38] Yamal: did you like third world? XD
[2025-07-09T06:10:55] haku: even 6cyl is so impractical for daily driving.
[2025-07-09T06:10:57] Noname: Me
[2025-07-09T06:11:26] Noname: Because I work 8 miles away and I like driving over shit 😆
[2025-07-09T06:11:37] Matthew: Working in risor, Norway i was there for one trip there was some sort serious sailboat racing going on. They even fired the canons
[2025-07-09T06:11:38] Noname: I can't car
[2025-07-09T06:12:03] Noname: Id rather walk then drive a car
[2025-07-09T06:12:39] haku: true american right there
[2025-07-09T06:13:06] Noname: Cars just feel so gay to drive
[2025-07-09T06:13:15] Matthew: Risor, Norway. Hamburg, Germany. Malta, Europe
[2025-07-09T06:13:29] Noname: There's like a bunch of seats and cupholders
[2025-07-09T06:14:11] Yamal: Nice
[2025-07-09T06:15:14] Noname: After driving that space ship.rental van it felt like a warm hug getting into my 21yr old shitbox. Smelled of dripping gas, mushy brakes and that disconnected steering feel is out of this world.
[2025-07-09T06:16:17] Noname: Also the broken dimmer switch said let's party with the flashing dash lights as I hit bumps
[2025-07-09T06:17:19] Matthew: Lmao. Some people are weird. I loved everywhere i went. Some other fucks that I was the welder for in Malta just kept talking shit. I've gone from drugged up and homeless to buying a house at 25yrs old. So I can deal with just about anything. People are much more social. So yeah, I loved all my trips. Well taken care of. Stayed at San Antonio resort.

[2025-07-09T06:20:16] Matthew: Malta had a full island blackout. Some people has some amazing sound system and was bumping the music and many turned on their cars headlights. People dancing and enjoying themselves
[2025-07-09T06:20:49] Noname: Stay straight drive a V8
[2025-07-09T06:21:58] Matthew: Just compromise and go 2jz inline 6 😈😈😈

[2025-07-09T06:26:37] Matthew: Hamburg i literally lived at work. I was in charge of open 430am and close 9pm... walking around bored over the weekend. There was like a small apartment upstairs with the engineers
[2025-07-09T06:27:45] Noname: Oh god theres gonna be a baby boom of peak.g30s
[2025-07-09T06:27:48] Matthew: High pressure explosion proof watertight doors for the military
[2025-07-09T06:28:02] Matthew: Oh, and the tits are the bosses desk haha
[2025-07-09T06:29:18] Matthew: Some of the dual shield flux core welds of mine. 2 hours to fabricate and 8hrs to weld.
[2025-07-09T06:30:33] Matthew: My first job making commercial mining dump trucks... the ones the size of a house
[2025-07-09T06:30:46] Matthew: Rolling

[2025-07-09T06:30:58] Matthew: Rolling ^^
[2025-07-09T06:31:45] Matthew: Don't work in shipyards, you'll thank me later
[2025-07-09T06:32:12] haku: haku industries executives are all present. we shall mass produce these badboys
[2025-07-09T06:32:40] Matthew: 2 people died in there from the heat. I didn't stay much longer after that.
[2025-07-09T06:32:58] haku: the right pairing vesc battery is now the obstacle
[2025-07-09T06:33:06] Matthew: <photos/photo_24567@09-07-2025_06-33-06.jpg>
[2025-07-09T06:33:26] Noname: @jamessoderstrom stop giving him.ideas
[2025-07-09T06:33:29] haku: nice
[2025-07-09T06:33:42] Noname: He makes me make things for him
[2025-07-09T06:34:00] Noname: Tf is wrong with you lol
[2025-07-09T06:34:08] haku: you hush it. moped department is shutting down all funds for peak g30s
[2025-07-09T06:34:09] Noname: 7am 😆
[2025-07-09T06:34:29] Noname: No I having a walk out see what gets done
[2025-07-09T06:36:28] haku: no dont. you will be rich when this pops off
[2025-07-09T06:37:06] Noname: All assets go to moped department
[2025-07-09T06:37:18] Matthew: The red 4 door civic has a oem parts built d15b7/y8 mini-me engine. My buddy tuned it. 126whp 4-2-1 header, if I had 4-1 header I probably would have touched ~130whp. 8,000 rpm drove it wild most everyday. Tuned on Hondata s300. Got avg 35mpg and had a 6 puck sprung clutch held the high rpm launches. Around 13.5:1 compression pistons with decked head and single layer metal head gasket
[2025-07-09T06:37:53] haku: im telling you bro ive been asked so many times where i got peak g30. if produced im sure it can be sold
[2025-07-09T06:38:31] Noname: Ok and I can sell pictures of my butt hole too
[2025-07-09T06:38:53] Noname: Nobody asked yet though
[2025-07-09T06:39:21] haku: maammoddeeznuts might @SirModAlot
[2025-07-09T06:39:55] Matthew: My old partners in crime 🙄
[2025-07-09T06:40:03] haku: i wanted to buy his 22x3 but too bad. hes a hoarder
[2025-07-09T06:40:12] Noname: Hes smoking butts off the ground and chasing girls
[2025-07-09T06:40:23] Matthew: Compromise haha 🤣🤣🤣
[2025-07-09T06:41:07] Matthew: @Bradhaku that titan supra was at hot import nights
[2025-07-09T06:41:34] Matthew: I wanted to touch it so bad
[2025-07-09T06:43:02] haku: mk4 one of my dream cars
[2025-07-09T06:43:03] Matthew: When people ask how I get along alone at work so many hours... im like its the best time every. Ain't no one there to bother me
[2025-07-09T06:43:14] Matthew: Same here
[2025-07-09T06:43:48] Matthew: Toyota really outdid themselves developing that mk4
[2025-07-09T06:44:07] haku: yep. even the one before that was a good car
[2025-07-09T06:44:19] haku: hell even the celica
[2025-07-09T06:48:36] Yamal: Wohooo!I felt good driving today!
[2025-07-09T06:49:51] Yamal: <video_file>
[2025-07-09T06:51:58] Matthew: Yeah, their turbo mr2 was a good hit too
[2025-07-09T06:52:45] Matthew: 2jz they're out there spitting out 1500whp on stock block.
[2025-07-09T06:54:18] Yamal: 0-100 :)
[2025-07-09T06:54:43] Matthew: I can't remember if ive shared this... rip headphones
[2025-07-09T06:54:48] Matthew: https://youtu.be/914hzQeTnw0?si=5oB4PTEKyBq9bPHt
[2025-07-09T06:56:31] Matthew: https://youtu.be/wN7OFX84Ziw?si=bNHR7h4mNT6L-qhR This dude aint human. Other racers say that the man is nutz and they would give up on the race when the front end lifts haha.
[2025-07-09T06:58:54] Noname: @Bradhaku How do you have 500a current
[2025-07-09T06:59:41] Matthew: 1.2seconds 60' time. My sc300 was pathetic from its non built automatic transmission and my 60' was 2.4 seconds lol.
[2025-07-09T07:02:12] Matthew: Are you building the battery?
[2025-07-09T07:06:54] Yamal: Can the graphs be viewed in the vesc tool app from a mobile phone after saving the log file?
[2025-07-09T07:07:55] Yamal: Chat gpt say Not”.. :(
[2025-07-09T07:14:18] haku: yep
[2025-07-09T07:15:23] haku: yea
[2025-07-09T07:15:41] haku: dont know if i should use up p42 or get 50pl
[2025-07-09T07:16:23] haku: 20s3p or 4p 50pl should be able to run these motors
[2025-07-09T07:16:43] haku: 500a?
[2025-07-09T07:17:07] haku: battery amps?
[2025-07-09T07:57:48] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: We will do them soon.
[2025-07-09T11:03:30] Face de Pin Sucé: Hello guys, question regarding Ubox 85V 240A, is it working well with 21S battery fully charged ?
[2025-07-09T11:03:55] Face de Pin Sucé: Precisely this one
[2025-07-09T11:06:36] AG.racing: No 500a phase

[2025-07-09T12:56:33] Face de Pin Sucé: We tried to keep price as low as possible even if there is a carbon fiber plate
[2025-07-09T13:03:02] Yamal: Dt achilleus limited have ?
[2025-07-09T13:03:43] Yamal: Wich battery you can fit in victor one ?
[2025-07-09T13:23:54] Noname: Yeah how the hell is he pushing 500 phase
[2025-07-09T13:30:45] Unknown: even comparing 50pl to p42 should be a crime
[2025-07-09T13:37:49] Dualtron Achilleus: The guys with the vstt here has them running 22s but he changed mosftets
[2025-07-09T13:38:25] Dualtron Achilleus: Ask him if he tried them stock
[2025-07-09T13:39:58] Dualtron Achilleus: I guess 6 or 7 p max
[2025-07-09T13:45:18] Face de Pin Sucé: No, it's a different size
[2025-07-09T13:46:23] Face de Pin Sucé: Can fit 21S6P (maybe 7P) with Ubox 240A

[2025-07-09T15:14:54] Nobrrr: Wait There are reall 66x1 Motors?
[2025-07-09T15:19:10] Nobrrr: If I remember correctly 21S without E brake works
[2025-07-09T15:19:39] Marius: 300kmh 😳✌️
[2025-07-09T15:32:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Should I buy 80h?
[2025-07-09T15:40:31] Noname: Why not you can wind whatever fits in slots. But a lot of current on 1 strand of wire
[2025-07-09T15:42:12] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I have question for u about this one tbh. how much phase and batt can it do max?
[2025-07-09T15:46:39] Noname: Max safe or unrestricted
[2025-07-09T15:49:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Max safe
[2025-07-09T15:50:34] Noname: Well its not really any smaller than 85/250 and that's 200/300 roughly
[2025-07-09T15:53:50] Yamal: From what some people say, 200A is safe, which is already a lot, they think it is the same in a C350 battery, but I could think it could work in 220/230 without any problem, 300 seems too much (my opinion) ^^'
[2025-07-09T15:55:34] Yamal: I used them for a week with 200 batteries per controller and it was amazing, but I decided to lower it to 175 because my battery isn't huge either and to prevent excessive degradation.
[2025-07-09T15:55:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 200 battery yes
[2025-07-09T15:55:46] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: ?
[2025-07-09T15:55:59] Yamal: 200 battery really no problem
[2025-07-09T15:56:06] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And phase ?
[2025-07-09T15:56:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 350? 400?
[2025-07-09T15:56:23] Yamal: And phase for “me” 300 max safe
[2025-07-09T15:56:37] Yamal: Don’t know never try more than this ..
[2025-07-09T15:56:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: For u not for me 😂
[2025-07-09T15:56:57] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I'm going to try 400 in god's help
[2025-07-09T15:58:04] Yamal: From what I see, to push the controller to the limit, changing the MOSFET is something very interesting.
[2025-07-09T15:59:32] Yamal: If I had plenty of money, I would take it to the extreme to see results/temp etc, but I can't xD
[2025-07-09T15:59:34] Nobrrr: Yes I know but I didn’t think they get produced
[2025-07-09T16:01:02] Yamal: For me, safe values are 200/300 until someone with "data" proves otherwise, argues, vesc tool etc..
[2025-07-09T16:02:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: U on 22s or20?
[2025-07-09T16:05:05] Yamal: 20s
[2025-07-09T16:10:05] Noname: Why yours says 500 then
[2025-07-09T16:10:09] Noname: Is that both?
[2025-07-09T16:11:23] Noname: I run the 85/250 at 200/300 on a 400lb moped no problems. Probably less heating on a medium scooter
[2025-07-09T16:21:16] Yamal: 500 is phase motor and yes 2 controller
[2025-07-09T16:23:22] Noname: Ok mabey moped is actually 300 but feels heavy then me at near 200 rolling down a highway it gets pushed hard
[2025-07-09T17:16:49] ausias: its pretty good
[2025-07-09T17:17:10] ausias: do you sell carbon plates por nami? 🤔🤔
[2025-07-09T17:18:35] haku: im not 600 on 2 escs
[2025-07-09T17:18:55] haku: 250 battery per esc
[2025-07-09T17:19:47] haku: because i have lots of p42 left.
[2025-07-09T17:21:00] Noname: Yeah but yours blow up at 600
[2025-07-09T17:21:30] haku: it didnt. just got hot. it blew up when i burnouts
[2025-07-09T17:21:44] haku: thy 2nd hy mosfets ones was a mystery
[2025-07-09T17:22:44] haku: need proper cooling. but those 85/250s might go to peak g30 v3 baby
[2025-07-09T17:25:03] Noname: What power are you at on v2?
[2025-07-09T17:27:01] haku: peak g30v2? 60bat 120phase 😁
[2025-07-09T17:27:17] haku: 16x4 50h

[2025-07-09T22:04:36] Matthew: Trampa sent me. Vesc express for free since my other one wasnt working with all specific functions. I haven't configured it yet but they said they verified usb-c cable functions
[2025-07-09T22:05:22] Hackintoshhhh: Trampa hardware imo way too big and expensive for what it is
[2025-07-09T22:05:32] Hackintoshhhh: I never understood the schematics either
[2025-07-09T22:05:37] Hackintoshhhh: HW4 uses drv
[2025-07-09T22:05:40] Hackintoshhhh: So obsolete
[2025-07-09T22:05:48] Hackintoshhhh: HW6 schematic is weird
[2025-07-09T22:06:04] Hackintoshhhh: 75_300 schematic is what everyone is using for power vescs
[2025-07-09T22:06:08] Hackintoshhhh: But it’s flawed
[2025-07-09T22:06:52] Matthew: Yeah, their jst cables are the large model. But I've never seen their vesc units...
[2025-07-09T22:07:38] Hackintoshhhh: Way too big

[2025-07-09T22:40:55] Yamal: Single why
[2025-07-09T22:41:01] Yamal: Only have one motor ?
[2025-07-09T22:41:26] Dualtron Achilleus: i have both but jsut making test in single then use CAN BUS

[2025-07-10T00:46:58] Matthew: So, on this ride the vesc overshot by 23amps... should I be concerned about that. I have set 260amps phase.
[2025-07-10T00:47:02] Matthew: <photos/photo_24589@10-07-2025_00-47-02.jpg>
[2025-07-10T00:53:55] Matthew: Yeah, you guys know them rims and motors more than me... still learning. The newest thing in my head small magnet huge stator dd bicycle hub motor makes so much torque? And geared hub, is there a way to regear its ratio? How do you calculate torque from it when the advertised torque is just say 70nm but its a 700watt motor? And then we use small stator big magnet high rpm motors be it hub or mid-drive unit... 🤔🤔
[2025-07-10T01:09:26] haku: geared hubs are wierd dude. i dont really like those. the delrin/plastic grear can wear out

[2025-07-10T11:00:35] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It's only when you go at maximum speed at more than 125
[2025-07-10T11:01:26] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I made the video to see if I could see it when I'm going 120 I can't see anything just the road☺️
[2025-07-10T11:03:13] Marius: what motor ?
[2025-07-10T11:43:08] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: LY 33x2 70h rear engine only makes that noise if we hit a pothole on the road at high speed

[2025-07-10T12:39:18] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: mmm the configuration was done by James
[2025-07-10T12:40:14] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I don't want limits, I want everything open.
[2025-07-10T12:40:39] Paolo ⁭: But I think is something about the motor
[2025-07-10T12:41:11] Paolo ⁭: If it happens only when you hit pothole
[2025-07-10T12:41:44] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: previously with shul it did not happen
[2025-07-10T12:46:13] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: When I hit a pothole the current cuts off but it only goes at high speed
[2025-07-10T12:51:33] Paolo ⁭: What's the error?

[2025-07-10T13:31:51] Paolo ⁭: At my opinion is hardware defect, something bad welded maybe but I don't know what
[2025-07-10T13:34:29] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Thanks Paolo, I'll check the cables sometimes. I think they're connected, but they're not completely connected.

[2025-07-10T18:39:15] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: The Schuls are more powerful than the G300s. They have more power with the same parameters. The scooter with Schuls goes crazy. It seems that the chassis doesn't work with the G300s. They don't have as much nerve.
[2025-07-10T18:47:34] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: What 60v bicycle motor do you recommend? Do you know anyone?
[2025-07-10T18:49:51] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: engine with chain teeth
[2025-07-10T19:07:30] Paolo ⁭: There's many motor like qs90 for "light" application

I said damn it... and was gonna go check them out. Then she tells me don't go over there. I say why? She said the squirrel that ate your flowers elly got it. Elly is a bloodhound and has been barking at the squirrels most the day. The squirrel is now her stuff animal toy. I said good job elly, get his girlfriend too!
[2025-07-11T04:20:42] Matthew: Bicycle motor? What kind of bicycle? Cruising or mtb stuff? Mtb stunt stuff then mid drive. The other good motors to get are on the mtx rims

[2025-07-11T05:02:14] Eduuuuuuuuu: It's worse, right? Supposedly, lower is better because it heats up less and the engines have more power.
[2025-07-11T05:04:02] Matthew: I overshot by 23amps phase. I have programmed 260phase. Do I need to change something or be worried about that? It has normally logged within 4amps of preset value...

[2025-07-11T05:15:34] Matthew: Which is best for dual motor. 30amps battery per controller.
[2025-07-11T05:20:09] haku: killing the tires even burned me gadam.
[2025-07-11T05:43:33] skrtt: “Ahhh my ass” he said
[2025-07-11T05:57:36] haku: i want to put fender but just too many jank already

[2025-07-11T05:59:11] skrtt: Ulips?
[2025-07-11T05:59:32] haku: nb power sells all kinds of stuff rebranded. they also sell qs kits
[2025-07-11T05:59:57] haku: no. the $19 ones
[2025-07-11T06:02:01] haku: im just trying to find the best fitting shape tire for this little shit
[2025-07-11T06:02:31] haku: im sure the real pmt stardale 90/50/6.5 will be flush
[2025-07-11T06:06:41] Noname: I just found this on AliExpress: $35.45 | ROCKBROS Bicycle Fenders Resilient Retractable Cycling Mudguard Adjustable Front Rear Bike Fender MTB Wings Bicycle Accessories https://a.aliexpress.com/_mL6GWAf
[2025-07-11T06:06:53] Noname: Jank or clean it gives you options
[2025-07-11T06:07:24] haku: fenders are lame imo
[2025-07-11T06:07:35] haku: i rather wetback
[2025-07-11T06:08:14] haku: too much accessories. will look like it can get confiscated
[2025-07-11T06:09:29] Noname: <animation>
[2025-07-11T06:24:08] haku: get 2 x 100/100 these dual vesc is good for space but if one dies. your fucked
[2025-07-11T06:43:45] haku: dammit alixpress why you reccomending me this.
[2025-07-11T06:45:00] haku: fetch me a bottle of cambodian breastmilk -pdiddy
[2025-07-11T08:49:13] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 💣🚀
[2025-07-11T09:14:01] 'lekrsu': That one is just two lites that can be swapped out inside.
[2025-07-11T09:34:50] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: When activating the FW the error is removed so I think it is a problem with the motor magnets, some of them will be a little loose
[2025-07-11T10:21:54] haku: thats good to know.
[2025-07-11T10:22:43] haku: it would be better if they change the guage wires and to qs8 though
[2025-07-11T10:28:49] Paolo ⁭: It's called lite for some reason lol
[2025-07-11T10:29:19] Paolo ⁭: Why buy lite version if the qs8 is big like the controller
[2025-07-11T10:30:28] haku: true. ive heard you can do up to 80bat per side. xt90 might not be enough for dual
[2025-07-11T10:31:09] haku: im not pro though. i overbuild
[2025-07-11T10:31:34] Paolo ⁭: I want to remind that the 75v 100x2 version was both connected on the single xt90
[2025-07-11T10:32:10] Paolo ⁭: It was more performat and people was pushing 270a total haha
[2025-07-11T10:32:47] Paolo ⁭: These MOSFET are crap, something else will die before
[2025-07-11T10:33:12] haku: oh is it? for the lites?
[2025-07-11T10:34:10] Paolo ⁭: Lite has magnachip if I'm not wrong
[2025-07-11T10:34:27] Paolo ⁭: Half performance of 150a version
[2025-07-11T10:35:48] haku: im downgrading my boys next build to that. hes using 150 right now. on 10s4p 35e
[2025-07-11T10:36:13] haku: i think i set to 35 bat

[2025-07-11T12:53:17] Face de Pin Sucé: Using Shul or G300 ?
[2025-07-11T13:18:45] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: G300
[2025-07-11T13:43:03] Noname: You click on one hot Asian ad on ali and your done
[2025-07-11T13:43:30] Noname: Kinda hot though what size you wear?
[2025-07-11T14:52:17] Rose: Hey there DB, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-07-11T14:56:41] Zillo_arx: Hello, I have some problems. So I really want Pedal assist on my ebike and I have a Vesc Ubox 85V 150A Controller would it be possible and how?
[2025-07-11T15:02:12] Noname: I tried one of those it was quite smooth for a stock controller. I only went around a parking lot though
[2025-07-11T15:15:16] Oreo huzky: Yes the standard hobbywing controller is very nice
[2025-07-11T15:53:06] cihan: When connecting an external battery parallel to the internal battery, I should connect external positive to internal positive and external negative to the internal negative, right? Or should I make one of the terminal connections of external battery after the controller?
[2025-07-11T15:55:41] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: for a walk
[2025-07-11T15:57:34] skrtt: What motors u have?
[2025-07-11T15:58:19] Noname: Before controller
[2025-07-11T15:58:36] Noname: Just straight battery to battery ++ and --
[2025-07-11T15:59:54] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 70h 33x2
[2025-07-11T16:00:08] skrtt: 22s10p?
[2025-07-11T16:00:13] skrtt: With p45b?
[2025-07-11T16:00:53] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 22s11p p45
[2025-07-11T17:10:52] cihan: Thanks. Shool I also connect external battery to internal before BMS?
[2025-07-11T17:11:53] Noname: No
[2025-07-11T17:12:18] Noname: They're independent batterys with each having a bms?
[2025-07-11T17:12:54] Noname: Then just output power is connected. As long as they charge and discharge on same wire correct?
[2025-07-11T18:19:28] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Typical in hope they stay stopped. I did maintenance and lubricated the pistons with lithium grease, but they return to the same problem.
[2025-07-11T18:36:11] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: We will put Magura tweezers back on.
[2025-07-11T19:07:31] Dualtron Achilleus: Really?
[2025-07-11T19:07:46] Dualtron Achilleus: For a 270€ brake that sad
[2025-07-11T19:12:11] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, I have had 3 Hopes of the same model, all of them have had the same problem, it stops, so I go back to Shigura
[2025-07-11T19:13:16] Dualtron Achilleus: I was looking at buying one xd
[2025-07-11T19:17:38] AG.racing: Sensor with 2 wire
[2025-07-11T19:17:45] AG.racing: On/off
[2025-07-11T19:26:16] AG.racing: Ok not 5v ?
[2025-07-11T19:26:45] AG.racing: what setting option to disable regen but cut acceleration when I brake
[2025-07-11T19:26:56] AG.racing: Ok 😅
[2025-07-11T20:13:20] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-07-11T20:20:19] haku: yams. kimbo slice is not a good representation of mma
[2025-07-11T20:20:42] haku: may he rest in piece. he tried
[2025-07-11T20:21:18] haku: if i was just admin here like i said. many many deportations
[2025-07-11T20:22:04] Yamal: For me kimbo no is mma
[2025-07-11T20:22:15] Yamal: Is street fight
[2025-07-11T20:22:26] Yamal: I know him like this
[2025-07-11T20:24:29] haku: agreed. but he steped in the cage with real fighters not street bums. and got destroyed
[2025-07-11T20:25:45] Yamal: On the street it looks better, it was a real spectacle 😂
[2025-07-11T20:26:08] Yamal: follow old Tom, don't get distracted
[2025-07-11T20:27:49] Yamal: Kimbo or Tom ,,? Clearly Tom xD
[2025-07-11T20:28:57] haku: tom aspinal? or bombadil?
[2025-07-11T20:30:40] Yamal: Likewise, there are always losses! You lost Kimbo, and we lost Juan Joya Borja, better known as "El Risitas."
[2025-07-11T20:31:42] haku: you have a new spanish superstar seems like. topuria
[2025-07-11T20:32:19] haku: beast. i dont follow mma nowadays but ive seen some clips. mma evolved
[2025-07-11T20:37:31] Rose: Hey there Darione77🇮🇹, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-07-11T20:48:09] haku: what the hell 10" 45h with 33x2 winding. who does that
[2025-07-11T20:49:20] Unknown: that shit has no torque at all😭
[2025-07-11T20:50:53] haku: i was hoping torque motors
[2025-07-11T20:52:04] Unknown: hehe
[2025-07-11T20:52:11] haku: gadam you want to start today you little shit
[2025-07-11T20:53:32] haku: ill meet you in the segway chat. ill need aome coffee
[2025-07-11T21:12:21] Marius: 250kmh at 20s and 0 torque 👍👍👍
[2025-07-11T21:17:02] AG.racing: Ok thanks you
[2025-07-11T21:53:56] Matthew: Dude's literally got me lol rn 🤣🤣🤣
[2025-07-11T21:56:11] Matthew: I was thinking they used qs products since qs sells spoked hub motors and 5kw+ on some of them ratings on them mtx rims kit. And i guess with legendary qs fashion that they take power like a champ
[2025-07-11T21:59:14] Matthew: 1st harvest
[2025-07-11T22:01:51] haku: im sure this seller is a noob. theres no way its 33x2
[2025-07-11T22:07:50] Matthew: This is what im finding
[2025-07-11T22:12:04] Matthew: I understand the higher the magnet count the more seamless operation should be so the motor kicks in before long rotation of the pedals. Sometime ive seen videos where people talk about 1/4-1/2 complete rotation. And i don't know how to integrate a torque sensor type for pas. I see the best setups advertised as cadence + torque sensor to help not be full power kicking in when all you are trying to do is just pedal a bit to navigate ares like sideways and pathways.
[2025-07-11T22:12:09] Matthew: <photos/photo_24626@11-07-2025_22-12-09.jpg>
[2025-07-11T22:12:51] Matthew: Other gurus are going to need to chime in on vesc integration and the proper items to purchase.
[2025-07-11T23:05:19] haku: i bet you can 40kw
[2025-07-11T23:06:14] Noname: This is bull shit hes 3x my max 😆
[2025-07-11T23:06:43] haku: 38kw on 70h 33x2 i didnt know its possible
[2025-07-11T23:06:45] haku: crazy
[2025-07-11T23:06:58] haku: that must burnout like a mofo
[2025-07-11T23:08:06] haku: making me want rebuild wepoor battery
[2025-07-11T23:16:37] haku: what is 38kw in hp mr Noname
[2025-07-11T23:17:39] Noname: ÷746
[2025-07-11T23:18:16] Noname: Its fucking absurd is what it is
[2025-07-11T23:19:02] haku: 50hp gadam
[2025-07-11T23:19:04] Noname: On a scooter that's gotta kick a Stark Varg's ass
[2025-07-11T23:19:27] haku: maybe. but the heat on motors
[2025-07-11T23:19:34] Dualtron Achilleus: not really 50hp
[2025-07-11T23:19:39] Dualtron Achilleus: cuz its two motor
[2025-07-11T23:19:50] haku: 25hp per motor
[2025-07-11T23:19:54] Dualtron Achilleus: you put two 20hp motor
[2025-07-11T23:19:59] haku: i see
[2025-07-11T23:20:02] Dualtron Achilleus: you dont get real 40 hp
[2025-07-11T23:20:05] haku: i hate meth
[2025-07-11T23:20:16] haku: whats whp on that?
[2025-07-11T23:20:22] Dualtron Achilleus: a single 40hp motor destroy 2 20hp motor
[2025-07-11T23:20:33] haku: oh is it?
[2025-07-11T23:20:47] haku: i thought awd is better
[2025-07-11T23:20:53] Dualtron Achilleus: yeah cuz two motor jsut help each other
[2025-07-11T23:21:01] haku: i see

[2025-07-11T23:27:27] Noname: I want gas dripping out the tailpipe and birds dropping out the sky from fumes as I pass
[2025-07-11T23:28:17] Noname: Ok well my truck smells like gas but idk where it comes from 😆
[2025-07-11T23:28:29] haku: 8cyl just gurgles gas on idle
[2025-07-11T23:29:41] Noname: Sips on idle chugs any other throttle position
[2025-07-11T23:30:17] Noname: I love when my instant economy says 3mpg off the line lol
[2025-07-11T23:31:01] Noname: I prefer wd40

[2025-07-11T23:32:51] haku: thanks bud. illl send spread ass photos later
[2025-07-11T23:33:31] Noname: I was clocked in but wanted to leave my nuts were stuck to my leg
[2025-07-11T23:33:59] haku: you lucky to have all the machines available to you
[2025-07-11T23:34:13] Noname: And no desire to build
[2025-07-11T23:34:24] Noname: I want a nap at my age now

[2025-07-11T23:39:52] Matthew: I dont even know how any of it is figured out. Cause from zero speed depending on your setup throws all the torque down instantly. Like a Tesla car at the drag strip if not the plaid model the Tesla car destroys competition to the 1/8 mile and higher horsepower vehicles take the top end speed of the track.
[2025-07-11T23:41:29] Matthew: That's modern Nissan gtr specs there hehe. Definitely alpha
[2025-07-11T23:42:46] Matthew: My first car. Noname
[2025-07-11T23:47:36] cihan: Yes, they are independent batteries. Internal battery already has a built in BMS. External battery will have a BMS of its own too. I don't know how BMS is connected to battery on ninebot. I should better see a dismantle video. Internal battery BMS has a separate charge connection so if I connect like this "external battery - - - > BMS - - - > internal battery" BMS shouldn't trigger charging because external battery will have higher voltage than internal battery when I stop.
[2025-07-11T23:51:02] Noname: Why higher voltage?
[2025-07-11T23:51:24] Noname: Nice my parents gave me the old minivan 😆
[2025-07-11T23:51:32] Noname: I think my dad hated me
[2025-07-11T23:53:33] Matthew: Bought it for $700.... and it definitely did not look like that when i bought it

[2025-07-12T00:00:23] Matthew: Until I got a car I was driving my stepfather tan f250 5.0 inline 6 and my mother had a Plymouth voyager van I would also drive. My father had an early 90s toyota camry. He had a 1985 Saab 900 turbo model which I learned first car before I ever even taken any driving school. I learned how to drive Saab 900 turbo when my father was in San Francisco and I was 12yrs old. And they also had a Lexus es250 that they rarely let me drive. They know I have a heavy foot lol and that Lexus had a nice v6 motor for the time. I didnt like driving any of them really except the Saab 900 turbo so I was always asking to drive it. I was working with my aunty restaurant and saved half the cost of $700. Then my stepfather taught me how to do more mechanic work.
[2025-07-12T00:00:39] haku: look this classic. right hand drive. is it a toyota crown what is it?
[2025-07-12T00:01:45] Noname: Plymouth voyager you know me lol
[2025-07-12T00:02:03] Noname: Was it blue
[2025-07-12T00:02:16] Matthew: Hard parked... I feel same as seeing the trend of trucks and suv raising the front end and lowering back end 🤢🤮🤮
[2025-07-12T00:03:59] Matthew: Haha good old red faded clear coat peeling from dodge/Plymouth/ of the era.

[2025-07-12T01:10:45] haku: actually the 60h might have narrower axles
[2025-07-12T01:12:23] Noname: So those going on green bike?
[2025-07-12T01:13:37] haku: no. 60h will go on future frame
[2025-07-12T01:13:54] haku: maybe green bike can have single 50 16x4

[2025-07-12T01:31:32] Noname: Ask james
[2025-07-12T01:31:51] Noname: Its 2.5 atmospheric pressure
[2025-07-12T01:31:55] Noname: I think
[2025-07-12T01:32:00] haku: @jamessoderstrom help the metrics got me

[2025-07-12T01:57:06] haku: $50 pump gtfo
[2025-07-12T02:04:26] cihan: Because external battery will have longer path to controller compared to internal battery and will supply less current compared to its capacity (probably 10s10p or 10s14p). Maybe I can solve this making the cable of external battery thicker since internal battery cables are probably 13awg. Theoretically if batteries supply current proportional to their capacity and has same type of cells with same resistance and age, they should not have voltage difference because of use, isn't it so?
[2025-07-12T02:04:45] cihan: Enjoy your new vehicle
[2025-07-12T02:16:44] fry the guy: Hey guys, so I am getting a voltage in balance fault code and my front motor feels like it has brakes on, but it’s the magnets is the controller blown?
[2025-07-12T02:18:20] haku: <video_file>
[2025-07-12T02:56:01] haku: yep this is the tire profile ive been looking for. if real 90 stardale has this profile im sold. flush fit. no rub.
[2025-07-12T03:08:43] ausias: how are those tires @Bradhaku
[2025-07-12T03:15:08] haku: no idea. but i know it will not last
[2025-07-12T03:15:41] haku: i like the tire profile and shape. perfect fit no rub on my peak g30
[2025-07-12T03:22:06] ausias: aint you tested them yet?
[2025-07-12T03:28:52] haku: not yet. 😭
[2025-07-12T03:40:24] haku: that white smoke boys
[2025-07-12T03:42:34] haku: it works womderful is what i can say.
[2025-07-12T03:43:32] ausias: do a launchhh!!!
[2025-07-12T03:43:54] haku: its quiet
[2025-07-12T03:44:01] haku: it doesnt chirp
[2025-07-12T03:50:33] haku: me too. its quiet this one. cant do the rizzcalls the chirps
[2025-07-12T03:50:45] haku: more smoke per dollar though
[2025-07-12T03:55:58] Matthew: Is the actual thickness of the slick pretty thick?
[2025-07-12T03:56:55] Matthew: I expected it too
[2025-07-12T03:57:33] haku: i like the squeels but this smokes more
[2025-07-12T03:58:19] haku: the shape is also flush on this peak g30
[2025-07-12T03:58:39] Matthew: @Bradhaku 65h and big one is yume y11... wtf??? The size is crazy. I wish I had calipers
[2025-07-12T03:59:20] haku: no idea tbh
[2025-07-12T03:59:54] Matthew: Gotcha. Did you use the 60h on your new setup?
[2025-07-12T04:00:08] Matthew: The ali ones
[2025-07-12T04:02:49] haku: no. that motor needs all new parts. peak g30v3
[2025-07-12T04:03:14] haku: new or used is what im saying. you know what i mean
[2025-07-12T04:05:07] haku: @jamessoderstrom so fill this tire to 35psi. i dont want it to square
[2025-07-12T04:06:30] haku: gotcha thanks
[2025-07-12T04:07:04] haku: yea i noticed
[2025-07-12T04:07:28] haku: yea. it might not be the ideal tire for vegas riding
[2025-07-12T04:08:12] haku: yep. 19 per tire. im not sure about safety lol
[2025-07-12T04:09:06] haku: 3rd set of tires on this vehicle
[2025-07-12T04:09:26] haku: this is smokier than the snakeskin
[2025-07-12T04:10:26] haku: im not sure. didnt really check.
[2025-07-12T04:10:52] haku: yea im hoping there are pmt with harder compounds with this same profile
[2025-07-12T04:11:08] haku: for future 22x3 peak g30
[2025-07-12T04:11:39] Matthew: Found it
[2025-07-12T04:16:37] haku: true.
[2025-07-12T04:19:52] haku: nice. toyota century
[2025-07-12T04:20:41] Matthew: The phase wires ok? If they cross the engine will brake. On your controller, did you go into the setup and put your voltage and amps values? Have you setup the throttle?

[2025-07-12T04:23:52] Matthew: I am running 85250 spintend on 16s
[2025-07-12T04:27:23] Matthew: I guess they say ride quality is better with pmt... I want to think it is like car tires. You be able to stop faster and lean further. But with how quick them slicks went up in smoke me thinking they're a fairly soft grippy compound
[2025-07-12T04:27:28] Noname: Let us know but I dont think it matters. Your using less power from the small battery then when it was alone. I have 2 16p and a 3p connected that play nice
[2025-07-12T04:32:30] skrtt: Gawd damn
[2025-07-12T04:32:39] skrtt: Looks like rubber to me
[2025-07-12T04:34:02] Noname: Pmt stick like glue but those prob ok.
[2025-07-12T04:34:37] Noname: I've slid on wet leaves and instantly regained traction
[2025-07-12T04:37:45] Matthew: Hopefully those are more than half decent. If they're ulip I feel they try to put out better products that some of their competitors
[2025-07-12T04:38:55] Matthew: Will this controller communicate with its lesser option model for a dual motor setup? Price difference is huge.
[2025-07-12T04:38:59] Matthew: <photos/photo_24653@12-07-2025_04-38-59.jpg>
[2025-07-12T04:39:28] Noname: I've seen ulip. Tubes are thick af tires seemed good, passed the smell test anyway
[2025-07-12T04:42:14] Matthew: If the lower options one will communicate with higher options vesc that will save $55... every penny counts
[2025-07-12T04:56:04] Noname: I don't see why not.
[2025-07-12T04:56:52] skrtt: Have u tried juniors,
[2025-07-12T04:57:23] skrtt: I would like to try t41 but im afraid to use them on a daily basis
[2025-07-12T04:57:58] Noname: Just stardale think Jr only has small size
[2025-07-12T04:58:19] skrtt: Junior only 90/65
[2025-07-12T04:59:18] Noname: Besides noticing they are flattening I dont race in corners they last a long time
[2025-07-12T05:01:21] skrtt: Flattening?
[2025-07-12T05:01:24] skrtt: Wym?
[2025-07-12T05:01:46] Noname: Tread worn flat on the top
[2025-07-12T05:01:53] Noname: I mainly drive straight
[2025-07-12T05:01:58] skrtt: I liked the stradale very much. Front one lasted me 3k kms
[2025-07-12T05:02:06] skrtt: But juniors grip better
[2025-07-12T05:02:28] skrtt: Cant wait to fit them in the new rim. I think they will be rounder
[2025-07-12T05:02:41] Noname: I have plenty of grip although I don't drive like a nut job
[2025-07-12T05:03:11] skrtt: U dont like cornering?
[2025-07-12T05:10:01] Noname: Im not a racer
[2025-07-12T05:17:21] Matthew: Ok, I just dont want to say wrong stuff. 🙂
[2025-07-12T05:28:13] skrtt: 🤨🤨
[2025-07-12T05:32:37] Noname: If they'd quit fucking around with "new case" and made m.o.a.c. "mother of all controllers' id be happy
[2025-07-12T05:40:57] haku: this tires are so quiet. i need abnoxious ones
[2025-07-12T05:41:21] haku: no more chirps. you can only hear the motor

[2025-07-12T06:28:28] Matthew: You got some pretty decent tires there 👌 🙂
[2025-07-12T06:36:46] haku: i need to do more tests. tommorow. cornering and grip
[2025-07-12T06:37:24] haku: if its good i will stock up. its insanely cheap
[2025-07-12T06:42:27] haku: i bet its gonna last 2 weeks the most with my riding style and vegas heat lol

[2025-07-13T05:53:42] Noname: Went to a pev cookout then the beach. Got pulled over today too
[2025-07-13T05:54:10] Noname: They pinned us with cruisers from both directions
[2025-07-13T05:57:04] Noname: Someone called prob because my buddy was going slow as fuck blocking the road. They claimed electric vehicles, cops didn't know what to do let us go. But cop asked me if I was the only one registered, yep. Then they split to go on the bike path across a bridge and I hit the highway with my 30mph moped and did 65 across it
[2025-07-13T06:02:24] haku: haha. the boys need that batteries
[2025-07-13T06:02:44] haku: or controllers

[2025-07-13T06:44:56] Yamal: I don't know what tires to buy, Manolo
[2025-07-13T06:46:59] Yamal: But in the end all okay right
[2025-07-13T06:47:59] Noname: Yeah
[2025-07-13T06:50:05] Yamal: 45 nominal right peak more
[2025-07-13T06:50:24] skrtt: That is what i think
[2025-07-13T06:52:23] Noname: Pev's are such a pain in the ass
[2025-07-13T06:53:15] Noname: We were swapping at the cookout. Rode some one wheels euc and tried a Honda Navi was fun.
[2025-07-13T06:55:02] skrtt: Juniors :p
[2025-07-13T06:57:22] Yamal: Like 140€ the two tires 😭
[2025-07-13T06:57:35] skrtt: Cant u get cheaper??
[2025-07-13T06:57:51] skrtt: I can get it here from 45 each
[2025-07-13T06:58:15] Yamal: Good price

[2025-07-13T07:05:08] haku: havent try that.
[2025-07-13T07:05:16] Yamal: but I would really like to go back to slashed tires
[2025-07-13T07:05:36] haku: same. no noise on slicks
[2025-07-13T07:05:45] haku: just hear motor humm

[2025-07-13T07:06:11] skrtt: @shlomda2 said that they are shit
[2025-07-13T07:06:36] skrtt: Kinda. I just get them without overpay
[2025-07-13T07:06:53] haku: dont even know where to get the ones i want in the US
[2025-07-13T07:07:13] skrtt: Maybe voromotors or minimotorsusa
[2025-07-13T07:07:54] haku: my local shop is sponsored by voro. they only carry one size of pmt. stardale 100
[2025-07-13T07:07:58] skrtt: Either go pmt or xuangxeng

[2025-07-13T07:09:38] Yamal: Xuancheng i know very well
[2025-07-13T07:09:56] skrtt: And tranfer everything to new frame
[2025-07-13T07:10:03] Yamal: This time want to try junior tire, but need to wait ….
[2025-07-13T07:10:35] skrtt: I love them. I only think i will use slicks on track
[2025-07-13T07:10:39] skrtt: Maybe one day 🥲
[2025-07-13T07:10:47] skrtt: Money problems?

[2025-07-13T07:18:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And they are they'll die fast especially the front one
[2025-07-13T07:19:11] haku: is it very soft
[2025-07-13T07:33:14] haku: Noname how hard is it to engineer somethinf like this but with motors
[2025-07-13T07:33:14] haku: Who is the first to try it?
[2025-07-13T07:33:56] Noname: Oh its hard
[2025-07-13T07:33:59] haku: peak g30 triple motors douchebag edition
[2025-07-13T07:34:12] Noname: Na front to back
[2025-07-13T07:34:23] Noname: 1 in the front 2 in the back
[2025-07-13T07:34:50] haku: thats a trike
[2025-07-13T07:35:08] haku: ive seen motorcycles like this dual fronts
[2025-07-13T07:35:46] Noname: Gay
[2025-07-13T07:36:35] haku: i know
[2025-07-13T07:36:48] haku: but would be cool to have a tiny one
[2025-07-13T07:37:02] haku: handicap edition
[2025-07-13T07:37:06] Noname: Ever seen a cycleboard
[2025-07-13T07:37:14] haku: no
[2025-07-13T07:38:51] haku: i saw. its still standing anus exposed
[2025-07-13T07:39:02] haku: need seated
[2025-07-13T08:04:00] cihan: Thanks. Cells will also be different. I'm not sure if it's going to be big problem. External battery cells will have less resistance and will probably surge less compared to internal cells. External battery cells are lower capacity but rated for 5C while internal is 2C or 3C. I want to simulate it but I cannot know exact battery resistance before I dismantle battery and measure it.

[2025-07-13T08:24:54] Yamal: 3 attempts today, let's say that with this configuration it's easy to reach the real 130km/h, I would need to increase the amps to achieve something more, which if I do it will not be to reach 140 but rather for extreme torque, I really need to do 11km for the speed tests, and it's the torque that's really exciting, these tests would be good to do in leather overalls xD there's no margin for error... but I'm very happy with the little pony.
[2025-07-13T08:27:08] Yamal: Stop speed test until change the tire ^^’

[2025-07-13T10:09:49] Dualtron Achilleus: Overvoltage fault at 84v?
[2025-07-13T10:15:14] Dualtron Achilleus: How can i change that
[2025-07-13T10:31:57] Paolo ⁭: Motor -> voltage limit
[2025-07-13T10:37:20] Dualtron Achilleus: Here?
[2025-07-13T10:56:18] Paolo ⁭: Ehm no
[2025-07-13T10:56:37] Paolo ⁭: Can you share me your remote settings credential in dm?
[2025-07-13T11:57:00] Yamal: You are 22/3 right
[2025-07-13T12:52:18] Dualtron Achilleus: always
[2025-07-13T13:14:03] Yamal: Is okay now the single monster ? Working well ?^^
[2025-07-13T13:16:53] Dualtron Achilleus: tryed at 250a phase yesterday
[2025-07-13T13:16:53] Dualtron Achilleus: Si okay now the single monster ? Working well ?^^
[2025-07-13T13:17:13] Dualtron Achilleus: its crazy i faster than thunder 3
[2025-07-13T13:17:27] Dualtron Achilleus: can't imagine a 350 phase or 400A
[2025-07-13T13:18:57] Yamal: Nice man
[2025-07-13T13:19:01] Yamal: Happy for you
[2025-07-13T13:19:30] Dualtron Achilleus: i wish on day you could try 90h 127mm
[2025-07-13T13:19:51] Dualtron Achilleus: its another lvl of torque compare to standart 110mm lonnyo motor
[2025-07-13T13:21:57] Yamal: But only I your type 90h
[2025-07-13T13:22:14] Yamal: 127 mm posible in the normal “ Ly
[2025-07-13T13:22:28] Yamal: Like my engines but 90mm magnet ?
[2025-07-13T13:22:38] Yamal: Share photos man !!!!!
[2025-07-13T13:22:42] Yamal: 😆🤣
[2025-07-13T13:22:44] Dualtron Achilleus: not 127 mm stator i have
[2025-07-13T13:22:47] Dualtron Achilleus: your is 110
[2025-07-13T13:26:40] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: When we buy the schul, they only send us the connectors and the pins so that the buyer can mount these connectors. Our friend James went to the trouble of looking for them after repairing my controllers. He got upset without saying anything. From here, new sales, thank you very much, James.
[2025-07-13T13:26:42] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: He encontrado esto en AliExpress: 3,46€ | 513532400 Arnés de cables, cable de paso de 2,00 mm con microcierre MOLEX, 51353-2400, 24P, listo para usar, entrega rápida https://a.aliexpress.com/_EGaYGtG
[2025-07-13T13:28:16] Dualtron Achilleus: did you already see a teverun 7260r motor?
[2025-07-13T13:28:24] Dualtron Achilleus: its exactly the same look
[2025-07-13T13:28:36] Paolo ⁭: No
[2025-07-13T13:28:58] Dualtron Achilleus: its not magnet size is about stator size
[2025-07-13T13:29:11] Dualtron Achilleus: bigger the stator is more torque you have
[2025-07-13T13:49:48] Yamal: And you can order that one 17/4—22/3—33/2?
[2025-07-13T13:50:01] Yamal: Still 11” engine ?
[2025-07-13T14:01:57] Paolo ⁭: It's 40x2 winding only
[2025-07-13T14:41:24] Yamal: Is like speed winding right
[2025-07-13T14:41:39] Franchesco Carofano: molicel
[2025-07-13T14:42:25] Yamal: I mean 20s 10p?
[2025-07-13T14:44:31] Franchesco Carofano: Yes
[2025-07-13T14:44:34] Franchesco Carofano: Ubox 85 240 & Ubox 85 250🔥the two fastest and most armed nami in south america
[2025-07-13T14:45:49] Franchesco Carofano: <video_file>
[2025-07-13T14:45:58] Yamal: Pretty nice
[2025-07-13T14:46:14] Yamal: 60h and 70 h engines right
[2025-07-13T14:46:17] Yamal: Both 22/3
[2025-07-13T14:47:05] Yamal: Two rocket ^^
[2025-07-13T14:47:11] Yamal: Nice
[2025-07-13T14:47:17] Franchesco Carofano: Yes 22x3, both the one I recently built has the kaabo ones of 2000 and mine has the lonnyon ones of 4000, one is 65 and the other is 70h
[2025-07-13T14:47:24] Yamal: And the look of both amazing
[2025-07-13T14:47:36] Yamal: Winter there !! XD
[2025-07-13T14:48:05] Yamal: Spintend flowing ;)
[2025-07-13T14:48:09] Yamal: Hehe
[2025-07-13T14:48:51] Franchesco Carofano: They work similarly, I feel like my motors need a larger controller.
[2025-07-13T14:50:37] Franchesco Carofano: Yes king well let's see how it goes to get peaks we have to upload some fw now I only have 200 curren max 400 or solved original ortega 170ah battery
[2025-07-13T14:51:25] Yamal: I use 150battery 250 phase
[2025-07-13T14:51:35] Yamal: Soon 175/300
[2025-07-13T14:51:44] Yamal: Or 200/300 xD for enjoy
[2025-07-13T14:51:55] Yamal: But my battery no is molicel
[2025-07-13T14:52:44] Franchesco Carofano: I took it at 230 once they didn't last, I broke Yamal, how do you do it?
[2025-07-13T14:53:48] Paolo ⁭: Not really , with 20s you can do like only 100 I think
[2025-07-13T14:54:05] Paolo ⁭: Because it's intended for bigger wheel like 16inch and not 11
[2025-07-13T14:56:28] Dualtron Achilleus: Its 25kv rated
[2025-07-13T15:00:00] Yamal: I've said it several times here, when my Ubox caught fire, I was going 35km/h without any acceleration and without having previously accelerated since I turned the scooter on at noon after leaving work. Before, I was doing 200/300 and without any problems, and I still don't understand the temperatures! They're simply mind-blowing! And even more so with high-speed motors. I currently have that configuration and everything is the same as before: correct temperatures, torque, top speed! Very fun! I'll upload the configuration again soon.
[2025-07-13T15:01:10] Yamal: Maybe dirt or moisture, but you don't stress the Ubox 250 with 230A phase. Of course, that's not its limit, and even less a "safe working limit."
[2025-07-13T15:02:29] Yamal: I can't stop thinking about having a UBox with an Infineon 22s MOSFET! It must be amazing.
[2025-07-13T15:08:00] Yamal: Feel free to share screenshots of Vesc Tool to compare temperatures, power, etc.! I do this daily and store them so we can see how each Nami works!
[2025-07-13T15:08:22] Yamal: Okay
[2025-07-13T15:08:37] Yamal: The goal of this engine is the torque extreme right
[2025-07-13T16:19:07] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah basicaly
[2025-07-13T17:50:04] skrtt: Be careful even when driving “normally”
[2025-07-13T18:00:37] Noname: Is there a way to change when power gets limited from low battery? Vesc shows 30% but battery will still be like 50%
[2025-07-13T18:10:15] 'lekrsu': <photos/photo_24682@13-07-2025_18-10-15.jpg>
[2025-07-13T18:10:53] Noname: Well the vesc thinks battery is lower than it is
[2025-07-13T18:11:08] 'lekrsu': Is your battery voltage not accurate?
[2025-07-13T18:11:08] Noname: I set my bms to like 3v
[2025-07-13T18:11:25] 'lekrsu': Ignore % in VESC, check RT voltage
[2025-07-13T18:11:53] Noname: Just seems when vesc shows 30% its slower
[2025-07-13T18:12:03] 'lekrsu': <photos/photo_24683@13-07-2025_18-12-03.jpg>

[2025-07-13T18:40:21] док187: Hello, I have a question about bearings. What bearing clearance do you use? CN or C3?
[2025-07-13T18:45:22] Yamal: Cut - off start , what that means?
[2025-07-13T18:45:36] Yamal: Power start going down ,,?
[2025-07-13T18:46:06] 'lekrsu': Ignore %, only voltage matters.
[2025-07-13T18:46:48] 'lekrsu': Yes
[2025-07-13T18:47:57] Noname: Its just annoying
[2025-07-13T18:48:50] Noname: So if I need to get home on low battery change to 16s or somethimg?
[2025-07-13T18:49:25] 'lekrsu': Wdym?
[2025-07-13T18:49:43] Noname: So it thinks battery is higher and doesnt start limiting power
[2025-07-13T18:49:59] 'lekrsu': Ignore that this exists
[2025-07-13T18:50:07] 'lekrsu': This is what matters
[2025-07-13T18:50:29] 'lekrsu': Have to check source to what Vedder does with that %, it's never accurate.

[2025-07-13T19:05:34] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Mine open 250 pahse 150 battery it acts fine but after long use feels like vesc(75200) don't want to give full power anymore and temp cut off set to 100-110
[2025-07-13T19:14:03] Franchesco Carofano: Yamal
[2025-07-13T19:14:40] Yamal: Tell me man
[2025-07-13T19:15:00] Franchesco Carofano: only one controller because the cam of the 85voll 240ah came broken I had to make the bridge I look how much it marks for my client

[2025-07-13T19:19:19] Yamal: You can't go very high with the A phase, because of the Wolf's engines, right?
[2025-07-13T19:19:30] Franchesco Carofano: If the temperature is fine, it's clear that it's cold here now.
[2025-07-13T19:20:13] Yamal: I think in both cases, yours and your friend's, the phases are "enlarged," but not from the windings themselves? Or are they? Did you solder them inside?
[2025-07-13T19:20:19] Yamal: Temp amazing
[2025-07-13T19:20:22] Franchesco Carofano: yes you can but he's afraid to break them he broke it already at 150ah
[2025-07-13T19:21:20] Franchesco Carofano: what about the bullets
[2025-07-13T19:21:26] Yamal: That's why I changed engines, I was tired of being scared of frying the cables, that is, having a lot of power and not being able to use it
[2025-07-13T19:22:00] Yamal: My bullet is Amass crazy good and big
[2025-07-13T19:22:28] Franchesco Carofano: Mine are horrible, the cables, my motors are bigger, the other ones I used 300 cables, nothing but medad fear, the remote control
[2025-07-13T19:22:56] Franchesco Carofano: My client's Kaabo motors don't even heat the cables, everything is fine.
[2025-07-13T19:24:48] Franchesco Carofano: the bullets are 8mm to install
[2025-07-13T19:25:16] Franchesco Carofano: he. The fear is the Vesc controls, not the motors or the battery.
[2025-07-13T19:25:52] Franchesco Carofano: The kidney motors you had are similar to the original 1500watt Bami ones.

[2025-07-13T20:07:41] Paolo ⁭: These are fake ratings, according to the rating they claimed for 75h which they say is 3.5kW, this is not more than 6kW
[2025-07-13T20:18:12] Face de Pin Sucé: KV not KW x)
[2025-07-13T20:23:13] Paolo ⁭: 25kV is surpassing the insulation of the copper wire so I doubt haha
[2025-07-13T21:09:04] 'lekrsu': Prob talkin' rpm/volt which is kV instead of what it writes out as.

[2025-07-14T23:17:31] haku: you a 30kw rider now yams. balls to walls!
[2025-07-14T23:23:07] Yamal: Little Pony still needs to make some programming adjustments
[2025-07-14T23:24:56] haku: next video you make. this should be the background music. https://youtu.be/XYM8VeOUolw?si=C26WyJiRmCzL-J2j
[2025-07-14T23:26:46] Yamal: O need nice camera for make nice video xD
[2025-07-14T23:41:14] haku: still cant believe you did it on a 20s. good job!
[2025-07-14T23:42:46] haku: 30kw peak g30. you inspire me yams
[2025-07-14T23:43:33] haku: i have alot of catching up
[2025-07-14T23:46:18] Yamal: Tomorrow again morning
[2025-07-14T23:46:25] Yamal: Hopefully all okay xD
[2025-07-15T00:07:01] Rose: Hey there D.​S.​, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-07-15T00:12:39] Yamal: Do you have wheel spacers? Do you experience wobbling at high speeds, or is it more or less stable? @elvis08014
[2025-07-15T00:13:41] Yamal: <photos/photo_24710@15-07-2025_00-13-41.jpg>
[2025-07-15T00:40:53] haku: hey just wondering. i know this sorta talk is prohibited here but has someone tested fardrivers on the track? or have you tested em on your camp?
[2025-07-15T01:33:34] skrtt: I know a guy that have
[2025-07-15T01:41:33] Rose: Hey there Mario, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-07-15T01:59:03] Matthew: On its way to 16s14p 63Ah 180amps battery. Spintend single ubox 85250.
[2025-07-15T02:01:23] Matthew: Test ride on 14s 35amps battery 100 phase. Zero field weakening. 100/100 lite
[2025-07-15T02:01:38] Matthew: Water cooled hehe
[2025-07-15T02:02:40] Matthew: What would be considered doing detection on lower amps? I mean how do you choose that?
[2025-07-15T02:05:15] skrtt: 14p is crazy
[2025-07-15T02:09:55] Matthew: Maybe I can go camping now.
[2025-07-15T02:10:28] Matthew: Have a tow hook mounted to take bicycle trailer
[2025-07-15T02:10:39] Noname: Just put battery in trailer too
[2025-07-15T02:10:56] Matthew: What model?!?!?!
[2025-07-15T02:11:05] Noname: With a powered wheel of course
[2025-07-15T02:11:52] Matthew: Is that you racing ?
[2025-07-15T02:12:47] Matthew: Dude that was having issues is cruising around and happy with acceleration but his top speed 25mph on 48v
[2025-07-15T02:14:05] Matthew: Hehehe. Run me 4 packs and 126Ah lol
[2025-07-15T02:15:04] Noname: Im gonna snitch Haku is a traitor
[2025-07-15T02:15:30] Matthew: Would be interesting on how a powered wheel would be on a bicycle trailer. How would you control it? Will a 3rd vesc unit communicate off 1 main vesc?
[2025-07-15T02:16:03] Noname: Well that tell us nothing. Is rpm limited? Battery sufficient? What wind motor?
[2025-07-15T02:16:28] Noname: <animation>
[2025-07-15T02:16:35] Matthew: Will 85250 be ok 16s 180amps battery and 300 phase?
[2025-07-15T02:17:14] Noname: Shit im 112ah 72v lol
[2025-07-15T02:17:42] Noname: Why not? Master tells slave what to do
[2025-07-15T02:18:15] Noname: Id def turn down the power on the back wheel. Could get interesting
[2025-07-15T02:19:01] Matthew: Oh, I mean hes kinda happy. He is running on a caroma 48v 1000watts scooter. He wanted mainly more acceleration but would like maybe 30mph but I told him check out how to program the field weakening and he should get there. He's using nd4835 controller
[2025-07-15T02:20:03] Matthew: And he hasn't messaged me back... I guess I'll shoot him a message tonight see if hes had luck with getting some more speed
[2025-07-15T02:20:34] Matthew: He integrated everything into the fardriver.
[2025-07-15T02:20:46] Noname: Its 48v 35a? Thats like a hardware hacked g30
[2025-07-15T02:20:56] Matthew: If im saying that right
[2025-07-15T02:20:58] Noname: Its not gonna be fast
[2025-07-15T02:21:28] Matthew: Yeah, I told him hed need a different kv motor but better is higher voltage
[2025-07-15T02:22:30] Noname: Well that's like 1600w so my 750w segway maxed at that and it was slow af but hit almost 30mph
[2025-07-15T02:23:11] Noname: Thats a big controller for little output. If he had more battery Vesc
[2025-07-15T02:23:54] Matthew: This stuff is all new. Im just finally getting better at wiring and understanding battery and controller capabilities. I haven't done more than dual motor yet
[2025-07-15T02:24:34] Noname: Well i haven't done it but heard talk of 4wd so I'd assume its doable
[2025-07-15T02:24:56] Noname: If they dont interconnect you could always splice throttle signal
[2025-07-15T02:25:08] Matthew: I wish I were 20s. If @Bradhaku still has his battery later this year I may end up buying it from him. 20s10or 12p I forgot.
[2025-07-15T02:26:00] Noname: Yeah but he's a hoarder
[2025-07-15T02:26:04] Matthew: Yeah, it will happily supply multiple motors. His 20s
[2025-07-15T02:26:11] Noname: With a weird battery obsession
[2025-07-15T02:26:19] Matthew: Lmaooo
[2025-07-15T02:27:03] Matthew: They give him balls and cauliflower anus exposed relief some how.. thats why he keeps that box
[2025-07-15T02:27:52] Matthew: We have motors and batteries and money to exchange if he still has it... but told him if hes got a sale sell it
[2025-07-15T02:28:24] Matthew: BTW qs8 😭
[2025-07-15T02:28:45] Matthew: I swear it took half a spool of my solder
[2025-07-15T02:31:13] Matthew: I think the controller he has will take more voltage just not amps. But also yeah, my g30lp with 36v and field weaking a full charge id hit 32mph and it dropped to like 24-25mph when 30% battery left. Just shu. But ninebot esc and 2nd gen motor are kinda amazing to me
[2025-07-15T02:32:19] Matthew: Deltamod is running 8500watts 20s gen 2 motor 🤯
[2025-07-15T03:38:13] haku: be quiet
[2025-07-15T05:26:38] Yamal: Wich racing ?
[2025-07-15T05:41:36] Matthew: What does this mean. I did setup. I rode around a little bit. All it did is was shutter and vibrate when giving throttle. Slowly rolled into it and it started moving decent. Then I just shuttered on me. I changed observer to see if anything positive. Then it just decided it was going to shutter. I changed observer back... now I can't even run the detection. Yume y11+ 3kw 11" motor had it on 280phase 180battery. Going down to 100 amps did nothing but go very slow. 300amps phase started from zero speed good but wouldn't really gain speed. No matter how slow I rolled into the throttle and it would shutter. And... like I said I can't even run detection now
[2025-07-15T05:47:34] Matthew: Now it says sensorless and the wheel doesn't even turn for detection. Why tf can I just not get something so simple done.... 😭
[2025-07-15T05:48:57] Matthew: <photos/photo_24714@15-07-2025_05-48-57.jpg>
[2025-07-15T05:52:34] Noname: I think this is the issue I had. I just unplugged battery restarted phone etc
[2025-07-15T05:56:48] Matthew: Yeah? Alright. Gives me a little hope for tomorrow the 100/100 lite just didnt seem enough and put it to use for 65h 17x4 and that ride this morning was great. Will try again tomorrow after some job application handouts and blood draw....
[2025-07-15T05:57:09] Yamal: Nop
[2025-07-15T05:57:17] Yamal: France race
[2025-07-15T05:57:50] Noname: Its good to replace a stock g30 with lol
[2025-07-15T05:58:13] Noname: Need those higher volts to get power out of it, it seems
[2025-07-15T06:01:38] Matthew: Yeah, i am figuring that once I get a couple checks I would like to throw a little external 6s pack on to compliment the low 40amps battery i have. I lowered amps this morning to 35amps battery because I threw in that 12v stepdown converter and figured 5amps is enough buffer for tiny fan and water pump.
[2025-07-15T06:02:45] Matthew: 65h 17x4 ran really nice this morning. The acceleration was actually better than I thought it would be
[2025-07-15T06:03:46] Matthew: And I would rather get more speed from voltage than from field weakening
[2025-07-15T06:04:38] Matthew: Here tonight I expected to throw a wheelie with 85250 280phase 180battery
[2025-07-15T06:04:41] Matthew: Lol
[2025-07-15T06:13:47] Matthew: Gotcha
[2025-07-15T06:14:09] Jason: 280 phase on 17x4???
[2025-07-15T06:14:14] Matthew: How much money does one spend on the scooter to have a worthy racing vehicle?
[2025-07-15T06:14:43] Matthew: Oh god no. On a yume y11+ motor
[2025-07-15T06:15:56] Jason: lol
[2025-07-15T06:16:01] Matthew: 90amp battery and 220phase was making me backflip lol. I threw the 65h 17x4 back into my g30lp this morning. That im running on 14s 40amps battery on 100/100 lite
[2025-07-15T06:17:04] Matthew: When I get a job i would like to do a 6s external pack for the 100/100 lite paired with 65h 17x4.
[2025-07-15T06:18:41] Matthew: I think im going to do 20s for 65h 22x3 on the g30p i am building which will be the one getting the speedforks.
[2025-07-15T06:18:47] haku: my guess atleast 20+k
[2025-07-15T06:19:06] haku: all the rage stuff is custom
[2025-07-15T06:19:36] haku: custom milled shit is $$$$
[2025-07-15T06:20:17] Matthew: This is what I did this morning
[2025-07-15T06:20:40] haku: and the question is how many spare scooters on the bench just incase one fucks up during a race
[2025-07-15T06:21:17] Matthew: 14s battery and tire repair kit in the white trunk. Orange seat thing is new as of today.
[2025-07-15T06:21:38] Matthew: And its a watercooled vesc setup.
[2025-07-15T06:22:34] Matthew: Thats what I did this morning. 100/100 lite 14s 35amps battery 100phase
[2025-07-15T06:40:01] Yamal: Traction control 11.000 rpm
[2025-07-15T06:46:55] Yamal: I think less, but the work on it is money too
[2025-07-15T06:47:19] Yamal: The more expensive 2 motor/1 battery/2 controller
[2025-07-15T06:54:17] Matthew: Just like any other powerful speed type of sport... crazy how expensive stuff can get in a blink of the eye
[2025-07-15T06:55:04] Matthew: I want that power.... in a gokart...

[2025-07-15T07:50:56] Nobrrr: Hello guys does anybody have a QS205 Motor?
[2025-07-15T07:51:18] Nobrrr: How good does it handle power and is it reliable?
[2025-07-15T08:22:31] Yamal: @SibClimb
[2025-07-15T08:23:45] Yamal: Good morning, how much voltage does the average drop in racing scooters usually occur when you demand maximum power? Perhaps in your creations or those of friends?
[2025-07-15T08:31:53] Sviatoslav: Hello! Just installed 75200 v2 pro to my bike. But it has wrong software (from 75300 ? ) Is it normal? Or i should update firmware?
[2025-07-15T09:21:12] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, it depends of many things We have some with 4V drop at 22S, some with 8V drop at 22S
[2025-07-15T09:21:26] Face de Pin Sucé: More than 10V at 22S starts to be a lot in my opinion
[2025-07-15T09:22:43] Face de Pin Sucé: I tested fardriver long time ago It's working, but it's not as good as vesc
[2025-07-15T09:24:36] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, if you go for Light category and are able to make your scooter, you can have something for 3-5000€ For Racing category, it's more about 5-10K€ (or more but not necessarily)
[2025-07-15T09:33:30] Yamal: Thanks
[2025-07-15T09:34:03] Yamal: 20 s easy to drop more with high power ?
[2025-07-15T09:39:37] Dualtron Achilleus: You can calculate it easy by yourself
[2025-07-15T09:39:53] Dualtron Achilleus: Just look at the cell data sheet and vdrop graph
[2025-07-15T09:44:48] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It also depends on the shape of the battery, if it has more copper or less copper, my battery drops to 6v.
[2025-07-15T09:50:43] Yamal: Me , easy to drop now 10-13 ? O need see well
[2025-07-15T09:50:55] Yamal: Of course with 200A battery por controller
[2025-07-15T09:51:03] Yamal: My nominal “ is 350
[2025-07-15T09:51:12] Yamal: And I ask for 400
[2025-07-15T09:51:15] Yamal: XD
[2025-07-15T09:51:18] Yamal: But okee
[2025-07-15T09:51:22] Yamal: Temp okee
[2025-07-15T09:51:34] Yamal: I mean temp of battery
[2025-07-15T09:51:41] Yamal: Esc okee too
[2025-07-15T09:52:15] Yamal: I really need computer for see well all the graph ,, is just amazing
[2025-07-15T09:54:55] Jason: I will build 30kw gokart at univ someday
[2025-07-15T09:54:56] Jason: ehehehe
[2025-07-15T10:00:22] Sviatoslav: hello! where i can find a stable firmware for flipsky 75200 pro v2.0 ?
[2025-07-15T10:26:27] Face de Pin Sucé: No, if you are with 20S should drop less volts as it has smaller voltage range, if you understand what I mean
[2025-07-15T10:36:52] Yamal: ^^’
[2025-07-15T10:47:03] quack: Sup guys?someone tried makerx g300 with qs205 bicycle motor?
[2025-07-15T10:47:17] quack: Till now tried only with scooter motor
[2025-07-15T11:22:20] Yamal: About 10 v //// 150A per controller
[2025-07-15T11:26:09] Yamal: 200A per controller ^^’, just a lot
[2025-07-15T11:27:30] Yamal: Don’t have computer …
[2025-07-15T11:27:52] Yamal: Hehe

[2025-07-15T12:27:51] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes but you need to see the exact current drawn at this particular moment Is it 300A as shown on the right of the tabs ?
[2025-07-15T12:28:46] Yamal: Need check
[2025-07-15T12:28:56] Yamal: Just I’m nob xD

[2025-07-15T15:25:12] Yamal: You can see A current from 1 or both controller ?
[2025-07-15T15:33:30] ✨🇪🇸عمر: 2!
[2025-07-15T15:39:50] JPPL: Any auto tune settings for motor 70h? Seems was talked that x12 ctrls are shitty in detecting, giving overall Times Over current abs
[2025-07-15T15:49:25] Yamal: I really need a computer ..😑
[2025-07-15T15:53:08] JPPL: You can install vesc full on phone to see logs
[2025-07-15T15:53:41] Yamal: For iPhone ?
[2025-07-15T15:53:57] Yamal: I can see current motor and is only one
[2025-07-15T15:54:12] Yamal: The maximum I can see about 303A
[2025-07-15T15:54:18] Yamal: So is one motor
[2025-07-15T15:54:21] JPPL: Send log to chatgpt to see if it describes
[2025-07-15T15:55:01] Yamal: I really do for see the graph,, but only one per day xD
[2025-07-15T15:55:13] Yamal: Every day the home cinema at phone
[2025-07-15T15:55:22] Yamal: I love it
[2025-07-15T15:55:23] Yamal: XD

[2025-07-15T16:40:26] Marius: what scooter?
[2025-07-15T16:40:34] skrtt: Dualtron victor
[2025-07-15T16:49:15] Yamal: Current in”” is both controller ?
[2025-07-15T16:49:47] Yamal: I see the maximum I use is like 300 A
[2025-07-15T16:49:55] Yamal: Like 150 per controller
[2025-07-15T16:50:13] 'lekrsu': Logs in Spanish 😅
[2025-07-15T16:50:22] Yamal: And English man
[2025-07-15T16:51:14] 'lekrsu': Is my phone wrong or does this not have anything in it? There's no numbers
[2025-07-15T16:51:29] Noname: Did you have stock electronics? Know a guy says gets stuck in eco mode idk if you've ever heard of that
[2025-07-15T16:52:09] Yamal: Is just the translate

[2025-07-15T19:12:02] skrtt: Have u ever tried the slack core?
[2025-07-15T19:12:48] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: The carbon kidney is a bit bad for the price you pay, the carbon breaks, I would feel scammed if I bought one.

[2025-07-15T20:26:10] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: to do a speed test if they let me tonight
[2025-07-15T20:28:02] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, I've tried, disassembled, prepared then thrown to trash the frame It's a BIG SHIT Frame brakes at 3 different parts : steering, front and rear plates Shitty kelly controllers, front suspension is basic springs, no oil, bad design Scooter is heavy for nothing, battery has BMS on top out of the wrap Fans are useless because against the wall
[2025-07-15T20:28:22] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes definitely 😁
[2025-07-15T20:28:47] Face de Pin Sucé: I don't like it, but it's personal haha
[2025-07-15T20:28:54] Face de Pin Sucé: Tronic 250
[2025-07-15T20:29:26] Face de Pin Sucé: My RM-Light is far more superior than this Rion in terms of power, handling, braking ,...
[2025-07-15T20:30:12] Yamal: Must change the mosfet
[2025-07-15T20:30:25] Yamal: I want to see working
[2025-07-15T20:36:30] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Rion was good when it was launched on the market, but today I don't see anything special about it. The carbon cracks and is of poor quality.
[2025-07-15T20:38:12] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: The good one is already different, he would realize that they didn't do it right and switched to aluminum 🤷‍♀️
[2025-07-15T20:38:55] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It's nice, yes, but nothing more, nothing special.
[2025-07-15T20:41:26] Yamal: New project
[2025-07-15T20:42:20] ausias: are you looking to seel the rs500? 🥺

[2025-07-15T20:56:19] Face de Pin Sucé: But that's it

[2025-07-15T21:49:18] Yamal: I ask you because I've been told that they improve the scooter's stability (wobble).
[2025-07-15T21:50:24] Arnau Martinez Casals: Idk, i thinck it wont if wheels are well aligned
[2025-07-15T21:50:27] Yamal: For 80h engines and up

[2025-07-15T21:58:19] Matthew: @jamessoderstrom when I get to top speed the power display and output is all wild. I am running 100/100 lite 14s 35amps battery and 100amps phase 20amps field weakening @ 85%
[2025-07-15T22:04:28] Paolo ⁭: It's just field weakening
[2025-07-15T22:06:46] haku: <photos/photo_24728@15-07-2025_22-06-46.jpg>

[2025-07-15T22:54:26] Noname: Winner of slowest accel vid on tele 😆

[2025-07-15T22:59:45] haku: some might call it master ragebaiter
[2025-07-15T23:03:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: This or fixing the 85240 with logic board from @jamessoderstrom
[2025-07-15T23:03:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: ?
[2025-07-15T23:04:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Well Sometimes the scammers lose
[2025-07-15T23:10:41] Yamal: It's sad, there aren't that many VESC controllers on the market, and X12, despite some shortcomings, promised a lot due to its power and small size.
[2025-07-15T23:30:59] Face de Pin Sucé: Haha nope 😂
[2025-07-15T23:42:20] Dualtron Achilleus: Not many but not really need more
[2025-07-15T23:45:42] Yamal: What?
[2025-07-15T23:47:20] Yamal: more vesc means more variety/different powers/different dimensions, and the more on the market I think the better prices, there are not that many vesc controllers that are 100x100 reliable
[2025-07-15T23:52:32] Noname: Where's that 20+kw model @spintend
[2025-07-16T00:11:11] haku: trust in big titty amy. the far fars cant whisper that long
[2025-07-16T00:14:13] Matthew: 😜
[2025-07-16T00:15:25] Matthew: Even when field weakening is off its doing the same thing and stutters and stuff. 80% and below its great
[2025-07-16T00:16:54] Matthew: Probably doesn't help i am using 11" offroad tire in the front with a vsett motor as well that's not hooked up...
[2025-07-16T00:20:05] Matthew: From 50 seconds in the video is where I am more referring to... it doesn't like being there... 80% and under is great.
[2025-07-16T00:33:55] Matthew: 1st person cam over drone is pretty intense 😳
[2025-07-16T01:31:05] Rose: Hey there Mario, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-07-16T01:44:39] Yamal: Okay, so I was wrong before. The values I see correspond to only one controller (the master), coinciding with maximum programming values of 300A of phase motor and 200A of battery current.
[2025-07-16T04:05:29] Anthony Meza: He did it. He traded up the flipsky
[2025-07-16T06:50:37] haku: no way hes comparing it to 1000cc bike. gadam https://youtu.be/5QnivJMayWM?si=uGWzPq1GALdQ_vt1

[2025-07-16T06:53:47] haku: this video is pretty much just ramp time in vesc. so much work on fars fars
[2025-07-16T06:54:23] haku: qs268. i wonder what amorge pack that is

[2025-07-16T09:24:43] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It gets choked in like 250+ pahse and 150 battery (not overheating though)
[2025-07-16T10:50:25] Face de Pin Sucé: You must have heard about the trial against Numo Slack no ?

[2025-07-16T21:27:30] 'lekrsu': Scroll down in rt to see more of it
[2025-07-16T21:27:53] 'lekrsu': It can be pitch adjusted in the app imu tab if you've installed the esc sideways
[2025-07-16T22:21:57] Rose: Hey there Tuba, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-07-16T22:47:28] haku: i will not budge. ship it or we will have a problem. listing said ships from united states and free shipping. gtfo with that customs fee.
[2025-07-16T22:48:35] haku: all this for a $70 10" motor lol
[2025-07-16T22:50:07] haku: chinamen catfishing me gadam. not today
[2025-07-16T23:05:04] Yamal: ^^
[2025-07-16T23:05:22] Yamal: You want to buy another 2 motors ?
[2025-07-16T23:17:14] haku: yea
[2025-07-16T23:17:18] haku: and 1 10"
[2025-07-16T23:18:15] haku: i want to make a triple motor yams
[2025-07-16T23:36:35] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Don't tell me to tighten up the bolts it tight as possible
[2025-07-17T00:28:06] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <video_file>
[2025-07-17T00:34:08] Matthew: I redid everything with 100/100 and it rides great now.
[2025-07-17T01:02:09] Matthew: Here I thought 63Ah was big lol. My yume is heavy af with 2 60v packs lol
[2025-07-17T01:04:12] Noname: Yeah that's almost 13kw so like 4 vsett 11 batterys.
[2025-07-17T01:04:46] Noname: But adding battery adding weight idk when its becomes more of a problem than a benefit
[2025-07-17T01:07:36] Matthew: I hear you on that. When riding my scooter i often wonder how quick my setup would be if it had factory skinnies and 50lbs instead of 90lbs of how much faster would I possibly go. My yume now is like 150lbs... maybe 140lbs... heavy af for a folding scooter lol
[2025-07-17T01:09:06] Matthew: Does the writing 51v and under it is 120. Does that mean these controllers are capable of 120v? Yume y11+ controllers
[2025-07-17T01:18:13] skrtt: Maybe u have some play either on the suspension block or the “hole” that cover the suspension
[2025-07-17T01:30:29] Noname: Yeah my vsett is chonky af. Funny the emoped frame I can lift easily its all battery weight
[2025-07-17T01:33:13] Noname: 880 cells is about 110lbs of battery
[2025-07-17T02:05:09] haku: all that weight single motor ubox can do it?
[2025-07-17T02:05:21] Noname: Yep
[2025-07-17T02:05:39] Noname: Think the saving grace is the slow start acceleration.
[2025-07-17T02:06:01] Noname: Putting it on the center stand is redicilious
[2025-07-17T02:22:23] Matthew: Do you know if those yume controllers mean they can run 120v? Or is that number irrelevant?
[2025-07-17T02:22:31] Matthew: <photos/photo_24749@17-07-2025_01-09-06.jpg>
[2025-07-17T02:23:27] Noname: <photos/photo_24751@17-07-2025_02-23-27.jpg>
[2025-07-17T02:24:06] haku: im not sure what exactly yume uses. my laotie is squarewave. they say max is not even 84v. i think 18s if remember
[2025-07-17T02:25:21] haku: i wouldnt mess with these controllers after using vesc. the wiring looks like a headache
[2025-07-17T02:26:19] haku: also these has to pair up with the right display i think. there different kinds
[2025-07-17T02:45:53] Matthew: Yeah, its interesting to me on how the dash is basically the controller. Shortly after I received my new scooter which was replacement for a truck running me over. I got home and the scooter wouldn't turn off. Someone chimed in on Facebook group and said just unplug the display. Did that and plugged it back in and haven't had issues with it.
[2025-07-17T02:46:39] Matthew: <photos/photo_24752@17-07-2025_02-46-39.jpg>
[2025-07-17T02:49:22] haku: yours sinewave atleast. my laotie squarewave. its like a on/off switch throttle. no inbetween. balls to walls or stop
[2025-07-17T03:02:52] Noname: Its not the wave its how it interpreted throttle
[2025-07-17T03:03:06] Noname: Vsett has that to theres no ramp time
[2025-07-17T03:03:07] haku: i see.
[2025-07-17T03:03:32] haku: my laotie almost killed me because of that
[2025-07-17T03:03:44] Noname: Damn so close
[2025-07-17T03:03:48] haku: i ragdolled and fucked my knee.
[2025-07-17T03:03:55] haku: remember the photo
[2025-07-17T03:03:58] Noname: Writing mean email to laiotie now
[2025-07-17T03:04:21] Noname: Bruised ass pic yeah

[2025-07-17T06:03:48] Yamal: I'm still not clear about taking different cars to travel between two points and folding the scooter. Are they rental cars from some app? Why does it do that? I asked you once, but it's not clear to me////@Un_Jason
[2025-07-17T06:07:40] Jason: they drive for the car owner
[2025-07-17T06:07:53] Jason: the owners are drunk so they pay them to drive the car to their home

[2025-07-17T06:50:39] haku: why are scooters getting bigger? is it only in america? or they have huge ones in spain too

[2025-07-17T23:11:04] Matthew: Premeditated suicide. Why strap a bomb to your chest when you can just turn the fuel switches off... someone was telling me the soul survivor of that wreck had 100+ persons of human pulp that cushioned his fall and luckily got flung from the flame... pretty dark.

[2025-07-17T23:59:58] Rose: Hey there Patracy, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-07-18T00:04:19] Patracy: Hello, I'm trying to find a solution for a controller for a project of mine. I'm planning to at least go 24s, but I'd like to go 36s with the battery modules I have. (Jeep PHEV's good for 400A each at 45v) The motor I'm using is a generator/starter motor from a Hyundai PHEV that originally worked at 270v. I've been looking at the MP2 controller. That seems like the best option to not leave me stuck with no headroom when it comes to voltage like my flipsky controller. Who's knowledgeable with the MP2?
[2025-07-18T00:06:43] Unknown: selling almost brand new spintend ubox 85V 150A havent driven a single Km (only tested free wheel) was meant for my xiaomi project but didnt have money to finish it. 105 Eur excluding shipping. (shipping price will be discussed in dm's) (price and also be discussed if u think its unfair)' write to me in dm if interested located in denmark

[2025-07-18T00:09:59] Patracy: Anyone have any premade MP2 boards available?
[2025-07-18T00:10:40] haku: peak g30 copier right there.

[2025-07-18T00:35:04] Yamal: They are all nice to ride, in my country the problem is that there are too many restrictions for too many electric vehicles
[2025-07-18T00:36:08] skrtt: Viva la policia
[2025-07-18T00:36:50] Yamal: For example, we cannot use your vehicles on public roads. Surrons can be registered as small mopeds, but of course you must like motorcycles.
[2025-07-18T00:37:40] haku: oh i see. but 32kw nami legal haha
[2025-07-18T00:38:37] skrtt: Less than 1yr and a half
[2025-07-18T00:40:08] Yamal: Sad
[2025-07-18T00:40:14] Yamal: I will pretend to be clueless, as if I knew nothing
[2025-07-18T00:41:46] Yamal: I also think it will take a while before they start issuing fines.
[2025-07-18T00:45:20] haku: yes. it will be chaos at first. thats the stage we are in too. only asshole cops will pull you over. but better safe than sorry you feel me dawgs
[2025-07-18T00:45:42] haku: 10k scooter/ebike hurts when confiscated
[2025-07-18T00:45:56] Yamal: In a year and a half, if the Nami doesn't sell, it would be time to be in the circuit or transfer everything to the Ninebot and remove 4p from the battery
[2025-07-18T00:46:03] Yamal: ^^’
[2025-07-18T00:47:18] haku: im not gonna lie. im an asshole rider sometimes, sometimes okay. so if you be that guy it will get confiscated
[2025-07-18T00:48:07] haku: i so chirps on slow bikes and scooters as my horn
[2025-07-18T00:49:15] Yamal: I stop at every red light, but on roads outside of town, don't ask me to stop
[2025-07-18T00:51:58] Yamal: A year and a half gives you a lot of time, and many things can happen
[2025-07-18T00:54:24] Yamal: Drive fast/be respectful and don't look back! If there's a police checkpoint and they have a car, watch your battery voltage; you might be able to escape! If they're on a motorcycle, it's better to stop, because they'll catch you
[2025-07-18T00:54:39] Patracy: The shipping costs, 26% tarriffs, and actual cost make it unappealing to me.
[2025-07-18T01:16:34] ausias: (or no)
[2025-07-18T01:26:37] skrtt: I cant wait to mount them 😭😭😭

[2025-07-18T10:21:06] Yamal: But what you mean
[2025-07-18T10:21:21] Yamal: 15 just front?

[2025-07-18T11:48:21] V: hey guys, any fix as to why my acceleration is so soft? I want that rip the ground type of acceleration and I can’t seem to get it. I’ve already tuned my throttle ramp time to 0 pos and 0 neg and honestly it became softer??
[2025-07-18T11:49:03] V: btw Im running sensorless
[2025-07-18T11:52:15] V: wanna get that wheel spin burnout sensation. honestly my square wave 40a had more umph to the acceleration
[2025-07-18T11:54:37] Paolo ⁭: Lol of course, square wave don't have current limit on phases
[2025-07-18T11:55:23] Paolo ⁭: If you want more acceleration you can try hall sensor and maybe try mxlemming observer, or simply increase the phase current
[2025-07-18T11:55:57] Paolo ⁭: But you can't compare sine wave with square
[2025-07-18T11:56:40] V: I see, so basically unless I get more phase amps in I wont get that type of acceleration
[2025-07-18T11:57:46] V: I mean while working on it no load it had the hard acceleration, but soon as I ride it it became soft. Im 75 kg
[2025-07-18T12:01:13] Paolo ⁭: Also 40s
[2025-07-18T12:04:08] Face de Pin Sucé: those are the ones from LY factory We stopped making our rims long time ago there because of bad machining precision, many rims have the defect of having the holes for the mounting on motor not perfectly centered in diameter, bringing small movement and vibrations. At high speed it's annoying. Not all rims, but too many for our quality standards. Also, they don't have the tire bead seat in the rim. So basically it's a "bad rim" And even more, you have the fully standards ones, so you have to remove the brake disc if you want to remove the whole rim, they are inverted, it's a non-sense
[2025-07-18T13:04:41] Rose: Hey there William, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2025-07-18T13:49:38] Face de Pin Sucé: All rims from LY are standard basic ones

[2025-07-18T17:49:50] Marius: damn
[2025-07-18T17:49:51] Marius: where is that
[2025-07-18T18:30:31] Matthew: I am close on my lp. Its not really going to look any different... just gonna get accessories like headlight, horn, brake and turn signals. And last but not necessary is getting a 6s external pack to help out the 100/100 65h 17x4 with a bit more acceleration and higher top speed without fw
[2025-07-18T18:55:30] Matthew: Really won't look much different at all. So far happy now with all the components onto the scooter. Just need to run some lines from my bus bars on the 12v stepdown converter for the accessories. So ninebot max g30lp 100/100 single ubox. 14s 20ah battery running 40amps battery and 100amps phase and fw at 20amps at 85%. Lonnyo 65h 17x4 single motor with statorade. Monorim v4 front suspension and since I had extra forks laying around from a kit I bought for parts that I just did a double laminate type setup so there is really not much flex at all in the front. Aoy-36rc 165mm front shock. Ulip generic rear suspension with 291r coil-over 150mm with 450lbs spring. Skateboard deck tape cut by hand, if you look close its definitely not perfect. Watercooled system made by myself to keep vesc cool. Vesc does not overheat at all. 140mm brake rotors. Monorim non hydraulic front disc brake. Rear only using regen rn but when I get a paycheck ill be able to buy a generic bracket to bolt on a basic disc setup. Motorcycle handlebar 26" length. Locking blue handles. There's a scooter installed lightbar and on the handlebar theres another rechargeable lightbar thats pretty frickin bright. Vsett front motor is my rim for now since I can't seem to put the mantis rim back together so I just threw it in the trash. Tire on it is 11inch offroad in the front and basic 10x3 rear tire. Segway ninebot seat and case setup that ali had for $60 and not advertised full price of $160. Luggage rack rated 50lbs. Generic scooter trunk that has expansion foam layer over the bottom half and plasti-dip coated. The foam has a cut out area that holds a battery pack. It has the 14s battery sitting in there but the space cut out will also fit my yume 60v pack. There's actually enough room in that trunk to fit both the 14s and 16s on top of each other so if I need extra distance its easy to just throw a battery in there. Shock absorbing/floating cellphone holder. Cable brake handles from generic budget scooter that has hall sensors so regen brake is variable. So thats basically that full build as it sits now which i just finished this week.

[2025-07-18T20:00:21] Paolo ⁭: So you have 100a phase per controller it's normal, 40a square wave deliver about 200a phase current. So just set the phase current to 200
[2025-07-18T20:18:05] Yamal: X12 where
[2025-07-18T20:43:54] Morten Jensen: If I want to mount a fan on my flipsky 75200 pro for extra cooling, can I use the 5v output on the controller?
[2025-07-18T20:50:22] Paolo ⁭: No
[2025-07-18T20:50:51] Paolo ⁭: It's useless since scooter is moving, you can just use external airflow
[2025-07-18T20:57:59] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 😘
[2025-07-18T21:00:16] Morten Jensen: Okay, but its not easy to do when it’s raining sometimes
[2025-07-18T21:05:34] Morten Jensen: I have mounted the controller on the inside of the scooter with thermal tape. Heat spreaders on the outside of the frame
[2025-07-18T21:06:58] Paolo ⁭: Yes I mean you can just put a heatsink outside it will be fine

[2025-07-18T21:29:30] Paolo ⁭: Because the front tire is just slipping
[2025-07-18T21:30:35] Paolo ⁭: Otherwise you set wrong parameters, because is impossible to do 0-100 in less than 6 seconds cuz of the grip
[2025-07-18T21:30:50] Marius: wdym
[2025-07-18T21:30:54] Marius: on g30 u mean?

[2025-07-18T21:32:33] Marius: its traction limit not power
[2025-07-18T21:32:36] Marius: so weight is good actually
[2025-07-18T21:33:01] Paolo ⁭: You didn't
[2025-07-18T21:33:12] Paolo ⁭: I told you it's grip problem not power
[2025-07-18T21:33:55] Paolo ⁭: You know that it meaning nothing right?
[2025-07-18T21:35:50] Nobrrr: I will do gps video then
[2025-07-18T21:36:09] Marius: gps isnt good for accel times
[2025-07-18T21:36:11] Marius: only for top speed
[2025-07-18T21:36:59] Marius: i can feel the accel in my clio too
[2025-07-18T21:37:09] Paolo ⁭: Hate for what btw
[2025-07-18T21:37:17] Paolo ⁭: Just want to let you know the reality
[2025-07-18T21:37:23] Marius: paolo
[2025-07-18T21:37:25] Marius: what is ur scooter btw?
[2025-07-18T21:38:53] Paolo ⁭: Okay brother important is believing
[2025-07-18T21:39:26] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: for the law you already know ☺️
[2025-07-18T21:39:38] Paolo ⁭: None
[2025-07-18T21:39:56] Marius: u plan to build one or not?
[2025-07-18T21:41:20] Paolo ⁭: It's because of the grip, nothing else , my friend mantis front tire still slip at 100kmh and is PMT
[2025-07-18T21:41:38] Paolo ⁭: Same scooter weight as you, same bodyweight as you
[2025-07-18T21:42:21] Marius: u have cst right?
[2025-07-18T21:42:47] Paolo ⁭: Yes I didn't said you set parameters wrong, I just say tire is slipping
[2025-07-18T21:44:13] Unknown: obviously isnt 😭
[2025-07-18T21:44:53] Unknown: Get some pmts and try again
[2025-07-18T21:44:56] Unknown: better grip
[2025-07-18T21:45:12] Marius: yes pmts are amazing
[2025-07-18T21:45:14] Marius: can confirm
[2025-07-18T21:46:03] Unknown: 😭😭
[2025-07-18T21:46:09] Paolo ⁭: Only dragy can confirm the test, I was very happy when I saw 0-100 in 5 seconds, but in reality was 7,2 XD
[2025-07-18T21:46:39] Paolo ⁭: I had over 15 scoot, I don't like them anymore
[2025-07-18T21:46:44] Marius: see thats why we need innovative engineering like @Bradhaku g30
[2025-07-18T21:46:48] Marius: 11inch and fast as a rocket
[2025-07-18T21:46:51] Marius: china slicks
[2025-07-18T21:46:52] Paolo ⁭: Unfortunately there's no freedom to use them legally
[2025-07-18T21:47:04] Marius: ah sad
[2025-07-18T21:47:11] haku: i believe i can fly, i believe i can touch the sky -Rkelly
[2025-07-18T21:56:44] Face de Pin Sucé: Ah you mean with 10inch
[2025-07-18T22:00:11] Paolo ⁭: Yes, also he uses cst not pmt
[2025-07-18T22:00:32] Paolo ⁭: Is almost impossible to do that with nylon tire
[2025-07-18T22:03:31] Nobrrr: I will do a video on rear and look
[2025-07-18T22:05:56] Paolo ⁭: It's useless anyway only Dragy can certificate it
[2025-07-18T22:06:25] Yamal: Easy torque with 10” than 11”?
[2025-07-18T22:06:46] Yamal: Because 0-100 in less 5 second is crazy super torque
[2025-07-18T22:08:17] Paolo ⁭: Technically with 10 inch you have more torque , but tire have less grip, so not, 11 is better for acceleration
[2025-07-18T22:09:57] Marius: who has that
[2025-07-18T22:10:02] Marius: i only saw rage mechanics
[2025-07-18T22:10:05] Marius: or are there ppl here too?
[2025-07-18T22:16:07] Yamal: To improve the numbers, I first need new tires, put less pressure on them, and maybe remove the traction control, I don't know...
[2025-07-18T22:17:04] Paolo ⁭: And preheat the tire😁
[2025-07-18T22:17:28] Yamal: also that no car comes
[2025-07-18T22:17:31] Marius: are there even better tyres than pmt?
[2025-07-18T22:17:35] Marius: or do they use the best material
[2025-07-18T22:17:47] Yamal: Out tracción control ,, more power right ?
[2025-07-18T22:18:20] Yamal: I want get Chinese slick tire xD
[2025-07-18T22:18:26] Yamal: Very cheap
[2025-07-18T22:18:30] Yamal: Just try
[2025-07-18T22:18:34] Marius: ask haku to give u a review
[2025-07-18T22:18:36] Marius: he has them
[2025-07-18T22:18:52] Yamal: Anyway ninomotos ones they use some Chinese brand
[2025-07-18T22:21:28] Paolo ⁭: For racing purpose not
[2025-07-18T22:21:56] Marius: do u know why they dont make 10inch slicks?
[2025-07-18T22:21:58] Marius: is it just no demand?
[2025-07-18T22:22:07] Paolo ⁭: But if I'm not wrong some kart slick tire can fit too , but it's hard to control
[2025-07-18T22:22:26] Marius: interesting
[2025-07-18T22:22:55] Paolo ⁭: Yes, because 11 inch are for minimoto, and there's no 10 inch minimoto
[2025-07-18T22:23:55] Marius: oh lo
[2025-07-18T22:23:59] Marius: i thought they specifically are for scooters
[2025-07-18T22:24:01] Marius: 😭😭
[2025-07-18T22:24:10] Paolo ⁭: But I'd you want best possible grip on 10 inch you can get Nami klima style motor and use pmt 10x3.5
[2025-07-18T22:24:24] Marius: yeah but no fit on g30
[2025-07-18T22:24:25] haku: best burnout tire so far that ive tried.
[2025-07-18T22:24:43] Paolo ⁭: Front fits😁 rear have enough grip
[2025-07-18T22:24:55] Marius: whats the dropout?
[2025-07-18T22:25:05] Paolo ⁭: 130-135
[2025-07-18T22:25:30] Marius: speedfork is made for 125mm dropout i think
[2025-07-18T22:25:33] Marius: id have to ask jan about that
[2025-07-18T22:25:36] haku: its for the poorest of the poor that cant afford ulip the bootleg of pmt slicks
[2025-07-18T22:26:59] Marius: what kind of motor is it?
[2025-07-18T22:27:10] Marius: like windings and h

[2025-07-19T16:08:56] Morten Jensen: If I set the motor current max brake high, and the battery current max regen. Low, where do all the current go to, when it can’t go to the battery?
[2025-07-19T16:09:58] 'lekrsu': It's phase current, not batt.
[2025-07-19T16:10:11] 'lekrsu': Same wattage, different ratios.
[2025-07-19T16:11:11] Morten Jensen: Where do the heat from phase current go when breaking
[2025-07-19T16:11:29] 'lekrsu': The wattage goes in your battery
[2025-07-19T16:13:03] Morten Jensen: But I can only se 8 amps on the BMS, I don’t think my BMS can charge anymore?
[2025-07-19T16:13:18] 'lekrsu': Did you set 8A battery regen amps?
[2025-07-19T16:13:22] 'lekrsu': In VESC
[2025-07-19T16:13:35] Morten Jensen: No 20
[2025-07-19T16:13:49] 'lekrsu': A bms can't limit you, btw.
[2025-07-19T16:15:16] 'lekrsu': But you have to make sure bms is set to allow more, else trips and vesc burns.
[2025-07-19T16:15:16] Morten Jensen: I was just searching why I did blow a mosfet on my flipsky 75200 pro v2.0
[2025-07-19T16:15:34] 'lekrsu': Well, Flispky doesn't make great products that last.
[2025-07-19T16:15:44] 'lekrsu': Clone parts and copied designs.
[2025-07-19T16:16:33] Morten Jensen: Okay, but I don’t think I can change anything in the BMS setting to allow more amps
[2025-07-19T16:17:32] 'lekrsu': Really? I can
[2025-07-19T16:17:50] 'lekrsu': Have it set to 100 to never trigger 😁
[2025-07-19T16:18:03] Morten Jensen: JBD BMS
[2025-07-19T16:18:27] Morten Jensen: Could I be therefor I burned a MOSFET
[2025-07-19T16:20:44] 'lekrsu': If it trips over current on regen then yes things likely burn
[2025-07-19T16:20:58] 'lekrsu': You can change settings on JBD if you bought the Bluetooth versions
[2025-07-19T16:21:21] Morten Jensen: I have the Bluetooth versions
[2025-07-19T16:24:37] 'lekrsu': Download their xiaoxiang app and check
[2025-07-19T16:25:02] Morten Jensen: I have that, I will check now

[2025-07-19T16:31:31] Jason: 2 sec of regen and bam
[2025-07-19T16:32:14] Morten Jensen: Battery regen. voltage is is set to 84v in vesc
[2025-07-19T16:32:28] Jason: max regen voltage?
[2025-07-19T16:32:53] Morten Jensen: Yes
[2025-07-19T16:37:14] Morten Jensen: Is there something in the BMS settings I have to change

[2025-07-19T19:12:13] Yamal: Your caliber vs disc look crazy good
[2025-07-19T19:12:51] Yamal: Also your controller are amazing 😃
[2025-07-19T19:13:55] Yamal: Your chassis was the downfall of Dualtron
[2025-07-19T19:15:28] Yamal: I repeat it again, how a man in an apartment in China managed to do this, there was no one else there, his wife and maybe some children, the beast was born that would change the concept forever.
[2025-07-19T19:15:44] Dualtron Achilleus: 270A phase only on 90H, 50kg dualtron + 70 kg rider. The ground grip a lot
[2025-07-19T19:16:14] 'lekrsu': You could increase the cell over voltage timer above 2s
[2025-07-19T19:16:24] 'lekrsu': the rest is surprisingly solid
[2025-07-19T19:17:26] 'lekrsu': green pcb™
[2025-07-19T19:20:03] Morten Jensen: What should I set the “motor current max brake” ?
[2025-07-19T19:20:28] 'lekrsu': It can be as high as your controller, and motor supports.
[2025-07-19T19:20:44] 'lekrsu': Go too high and it just grip glides
[2025-07-19T19:21:22] 'lekrsu': I do -19A batt (cells aren't rated for more) and -100A phase as -115A slides on ground. Very setup dependant, don't copy.

[2025-07-19T19:22:56] Morten Jensen: I have set it to -160a and -20 is that why my mosfet burned
[2025-07-19T19:28:47] Yamal: You say still have 75h engine for mount infront right
[2025-07-19T19:30:48] Dualtron Achilleus: yeah waiting to go up to 350 phase
[2025-07-19T19:31:32] 'lekrsu': Could be, hard to say
[2025-07-19T19:33:35] Yamal: You have your on special vesc?
[2025-07-19T19:40:32] 'lekrsu': temp sensor in Narnia
[2025-07-19T19:41:39] Yamal: Motor you mean
[2025-07-19T19:53:01] haku: thats hot my boy
[2025-07-19T19:53:39] haku: this one
[2025-07-19T20:03:08] Dualtron Achilleus: You teached me how to
[2025-07-19T20:09:11] Paolo ⁭: There was no temp sensor lol
[2025-07-19T20:16:29] Matthew: If youre running 160regen to each motor id be surprised if you dont fly off the front haha. Single motor and dual motor i utilize 100amps max and it slows pretty well with 50h and ive only used up to 65h motor torque and standard motors and they both provide good brake power too.
[2025-07-19T20:18:27] Morten Jensen: <photos/photo_24803@19-07-2025_20-18-27.jpg>
[2025-07-19T20:18:48] Morten Jensen: I use single vsett10 motor
[2025-07-19T20:19:36] 'lekrsu': What the fuck
[2025-07-19T20:20:21] 'lekrsu': Your bms is configured so far below this
[2025-07-19T20:20:46] 'lekrsu': OCP at 120A but VESC set to 300?!
[2025-07-19T20:21:50] Morten Jensen: I have 2 BMS’s
[2025-07-19T20:22:49] Morten Jensen: When I read the bms’s I pull 40A + 85A
[2025-07-19T20:22:51] Finn: 85150 easy
[2025-07-19T20:23:38] 'lekrsu': Your vesc settings are so wrong for this
[2025-07-19T20:24:52] 'lekrsu': When you set 50A, you get 50A. Settings values as high as they go is just expecting failure.
[2025-07-19T20:25:42] Matthew: If variable regen single motor shouldn't be too crazy. I think I ran 60amps per motor regen when I had dual motor vsett 10+ and more that that was too abrupt the way i was still learning
[2025-07-19T20:27:18] Morten Jensen: It does not brake like crazy at all
[2025-07-19T20:27:32] 'lekrsu': Because it's -20A
[2025-07-19T20:28:21] Morten Jensen: How high should I go
[2025-07-19T20:29:16] haku: Noname this is why! these are the boys. they will bring the hammer down https://www.fox5vegas.com/2025/07/19/outraged-disturbed-group-e-motorcycle-riders-caught-video-tearing-up-county-park/
[2025-07-19T20:29:19] 'lekrsu': Check cell datasheet and multiply by peak rating * P count
[2025-07-19T20:29:57] 'lekrsu': That would be the max by battery, completely ignoring other factors like bms, vesc model, welding etc
[2025-07-19T20:31:19] Morten Jensen: I use a lot of different cells, so its not easy 😅
[2025-07-19T20:31:55] 'lekrsu': Mixed cells in the the same batteries?
[2025-07-19T20:32:13] 'lekrsu': You shouldn't do that

[2025-07-19T20:35:00] Morten Jensen: Sorry guys 🙈
[2025-07-19T20:37:46] Morten Jensen: The vesc say I use 200A peak
[2025-07-19T20:48:45] Matthew: 120 and 20 on 16s was fine for my pack but 120amps was just too much for my setup and lowered it to 100.
[2025-07-19T20:48:55] Noname: Guess where I am.
[2025-07-19T20:48:57] Matthew: I have 85250 spintend
[2025-07-19T20:49:20] haku: gulf of america. good for you

[2025-07-19T23:13:52] haku: thats pork. the marbling is insane
[2025-07-19T23:13:58] skrtt: Yes
[2025-07-19T23:14:02] haku: wow
[2025-07-19T23:14:13] skrtt: Im stupid with this new suplier
[2025-07-19T23:14:26] skrtt: Got to keep it under my payment eheheh
[2025-07-19T23:15:05] haku: the color looks like beef. never seen pork this red
[2025-07-19T23:36:55] 'lekrsu': Never use Slow ABS, it's dangerous
[2025-07-19T23:52:02] Rose: Hey there 0001, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-07-20T00:15:27] Eduuuuuuuuu: Hello, I have 110A phases and 60A battery installed, and I don't feel like it has a fast output, it has less torque than with the original controller, does anyone know if the torque can be configured?
[2025-07-20T00:25:06] 'lekrsu': ADC tab has a 0.2 second throttle delay by default, and changing observer to ortega original or mxlemming without lambda does do a difference.
[2025-07-20T01:13:43] haku: need to make these kind of videos but with scooters. how?? https://youtube.com/shorts/21vulbuuYQk?si=GpoDwtW-2oxSp9Ol

[2025-07-20T06:19:02] Chen Simhony: same 300w xiaomi motors
[2025-07-20T06:48:40] haku: wheres the legendary 18fet jason vesc. my fellow intellectual friend.
[2025-07-20T07:01:00] Noname: 370 miles. Im not the fastest but ya cant beat my new high score for miles
[2025-07-20T07:20:44] haku: now new goal. coast to coast only using niu
[2025-07-20T07:21:15] Noname: Is the pavement better there? I need a new spine
[2025-07-20T07:22:14] haku: get better cushioned seats
[2025-07-20T07:22:29] haku: custom
[2025-07-20T07:24:39] haku: do you take highways?
[2025-07-20T07:27:33] Noname: Yeah "Routes" and made a mistake and ended up on the highway for an exit then back
[2025-07-20T07:28:07] Noname: I could have driven from Vegas to San Diego to put things in perspective
[2025-07-20T07:28:46] haku: jeez. thats crazy on alectric moped
[2025-07-20T07:29:01] Noname: Need a hybrid
[2025-07-20T07:29:24] haku: nah. just need a solar trailer
[2025-07-20T07:30:24] haku: you prolly be guinness world record for coast to coast on electric moped
[2025-07-20T07:30:49] Noname: 18 hrs 23kw my trip. If I had a 1kw gene that's 18kw I'd need a 5kw battery
[2025-07-20T07:31:07] Noname: It'd weigh a lot less
[2025-07-20T07:31:46] haku: also vesc staying cool
[2025-07-20T07:32:09] haku: lots of incline?
[2025-07-20T07:32:24] Noname: Yeah it did great I was ripping for a while at 50
[2025-07-20T07:32:42] Noname: Yeah its Appalachia
[2025-07-20T07:34:30] Yamal: Nice man
[2025-07-20T07:34:39] Yamal: Too many kilometres
[2025-07-20T07:34:53] Yamal: Ride in group or alone ?
[2025-07-20T07:36:21] Noname: With one friend on Ninja 250 to the beach for most of it then met friends for a charge and went home
[2025-07-20T07:36:46] Noname: Like 150 miles alone
[2025-07-20T10:12:30] Rose: Hey there владік, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-07-20T10:39:06] Rogerio Figueiredo: E don't see 100 kmh
[2025-07-20T10:39:11] Rogerio Figueiredo: 😂😂😂
[2025-07-20T10:55:51] владік: where is sensorless start speed in vesctool mobile? anyone knows?
[2025-07-20T11:12:46] Paolo ⁭: Sensorless page, then sensorless erpm
[2025-07-20T11:27:17] владік: thanks, is it ok at start my motor does like brr and then its ok
[2025-07-20T11:29:31] владік: brr for half a second btw, its like switching from halls to sensorless
[2025-07-20T12:10:42] 'lekrsu': You're probably running sensorless without halls
[2025-07-20T12:26:33] владік: is it ok tho ?
[2025-07-20T12:28:46] 'lekrsu': It's fine to ride only sensorless, yeah.
[2025-07-20T12:29:28] владік: thanks!

[2025-07-20T12:43:01] Nobrrr: Does the eggrider display work with Vesc? Or is there a script to get it work with?
[2025-07-20T12:46:15] Rogerio Figueiredo: Sensorless is better
[2025-07-20T12:46:18] Rogerio Figueiredo: Less problems

[2025-07-20T13:00:51] Rogerio Figueiredo: Any one use it?
[2025-07-20T16:24:54] Patrick: Yesterday I tried a test run again on the current setup that worked well the other days before, and I already went 104 km/h with it. I tried a top speed run yesterday again and I got an ABS overcurrent for the first time. ABS is set to 255A, 170A Phase & 150A Battery. What can I do to fix this? And maybe go to the 200A phase I tried 200A phase once, it pulls way better, but I got an ABS overcurrent there.
[2025-07-20T16:24:54] Patrick: <photos/photo_24815@20-07-2025_16-24-54.jpg>
[2025-07-20T16:26:44] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It seems like the same problem
[2025-07-20T16:28:18] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: lower the phase amps
[2025-07-20T16:28:56] Patrick: There has to be a other way, the 170A Phase are also way below what the motor can even handle
[2025-07-20T16:29:06] Patrick: What settings do i need to play around with
[2025-07-20T16:31:47] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: With Schul I can put 400 phase and 200 battery. With G300 I can't put more than 350 phase because the error pops up. Same motors, same cables.
[2025-07-20T16:32:39] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: try lowering the phase amps and test
[2025-07-20T17:48:40] Rose: Hey there Mario, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-07-20T18:08:00] Paolo ⁭: @SibClimb did the fast girl perform better than aymard?
[2025-07-20T18:41:09] cihan: How's scooter hacking utility on ninebot f2 pro compared to original firmware? Any bugs, glitches? How much battery current can controller handle? @Supremeavocado225
[2025-07-20T18:45:40] Unknown: <files/Screen_Recording_20250404_141019_m365 Tools.mp4>
[2025-07-20T18:46:18] Unknown: Its still pretty controlled. There is some limit i guess. Even when i set current to 80A nothing changes in speed or whatever. Bugwise there isnt anything i can complain about. Current u can see in the screen revording here. I think i set it to 35 or smth but i believe its limited to som other current a little lower than that
[2025-07-20T18:53:00] cihan: Thanks a lot. It has pretty good acceleration. Are you using the throttle with current control? I guess acceleration can be even slightly better with parallel battery especially when battery has less charge.
[2025-07-20T18:53:14] cihan: By the way what's your weight?
[2025-07-20T18:53:39] cihan: Xiaodash reports battery current as 25A maximum with stock firmware.
[2025-07-20T18:54:04] 'lekrsu': F2 likely trips ocp at 30.
[2025-07-20T18:54:13] cihan: Even if I can have 25A from start and until 45 km/h, it's probably enough for me.
[2025-07-20T18:55:03] cihan: Probably, at some moment SHU reports power close to 2000W, is it true? Maybe it's when BMS trips.
[2025-07-20T18:55:50] cihan: Will I be able to supply even more current with parallel battery if I draw most current from the external battery?
[2025-07-20T18:55:56] 'lekrsu': You mean on dash wattage showing 20?
[2025-07-20T18:56:15] 'lekrsu': We don't offer live data through shu
[2025-07-20T18:56:43] cihan: On the video William uploaded it's something close to 2000W as seen on SHU app.
[2025-07-20T18:56:51] 'lekrsu': The firmware is called shfw, not shu
[2025-07-20T18:57:07] 'lekrsu': He didn't record the shu app
[2025-07-20T18:57:25] cihan: Ahh sorry, I thought it was SHU.
[2025-07-20T18:57:35] 'lekrsu': Utility is the app.
[2025-07-20T18:57:57] 'lekrsu': <photos/photo_24818@20-07-2025_18-57-57.jpg>
[2025-07-20T19:00:00] Dualtron Achilleus: how much torque ? YES
[2025-07-20T19:00:01] cihan: I understand now. William used to tell he used SHU. Is SHU and SHFW developed by different developers?
[2025-07-20T19:00:33] 'lekrsu': No, SHU is ScooterHacking Utility - the Android app. SHFW is ScooterHacking Firmware, the DRV firmware on your actual scooter.
[2025-07-20T19:00:46] 'lekrsu': One would say too much xD
[2025-07-20T19:01:33] Marius: no such thing
[2025-07-20T19:03:18] Marius: what tyres are these?
[2025-07-20T19:05:02] Dualtron Achilleus: for 90H no pmt
[2025-07-20T19:05:03] cihan: Thanks. Can controller or BMS somehow sense externally parallel connected battery? Is it the BMS tripping at 30A? Maybe I can use some more current with parallel battery.
[2025-07-20T19:05:18] Marius: hmmm
[2025-07-20T19:05:25] Marius: i thought they got really wide slicks
[2025-07-20T19:05:41] Dualtron Achilleus: pmt dont make 7 inch tire or i missed something
[2025-07-20T19:05:42] skrtt: But u have 7” rim
[2025-07-20T19:05:47] Marius: oh
[2025-07-20T19:05:50] Marius: i thought its 6.5 inch
[2025-07-20T19:06:14] Dualtron Achilleus: hey i mean the 90h 127 mm stator version
[2025-07-20T19:06:28] Marius: i thought 6.5 is the standard
[2025-07-20T19:06:38] Marius: whats the upside of having 7inch?
[2025-07-20T19:07:31] Dualtron Achilleus: lot more torque cuz the magnet are more far from the center
[2025-07-20T19:07:51] Unknown: i weigh 58-60kg
[2025-07-20T19:08:03] Dualtron Achilleus: giving more lever streng
[2025-07-20T19:08:15] Marius: ah so bigger stator right?
[2025-07-20T19:08:35] Dualtron Achilleus: yeah bigger 127mm vs 110 mm for standar 75h 80H 90H and 100H
[2025-07-20T19:09:03] Dualtron Achilleus: MIA from lonnoy say its the most torquey motor from all i quoted
[2025-07-20T19:09:21] Unknown: Ah yeah my bad. I used Scooter Hackinh Utility (App) to flash Scooter Hacking FirmWare :)
[2025-07-20T19:09:24] skrtt: How is g300 going?
[2025-07-20T19:09:49] Marius: makes sense
[2025-07-20T19:09:57] Dualtron Achilleus: didnt try yet i waiting for 7aWG wire atm
[2025-07-20T19:09:58] Marius: dont tell haku about this one
[2025-07-20T19:10:02] cihan: I certainly need more current than you. :) You flashed SHFW for max g2 on ninebot f2 pro, right?
[2025-07-20T19:10:14] skrtt: So what esc now?
[2025-07-20T19:10:23] Dualtron Achilleus: 85 250
[2025-07-20T19:10:23] Marius: he will go into bankruptcy
[2025-07-20T19:10:25] cihan: Thanks, I just noticed your message.
[2025-07-20T19:10:47] skrtt: He already declared it
[2025-07-20T19:11:03] Marius: burned too many china slicks i see?
[2025-07-20T19:11:09] 'lekrsu': it can't detect something like it
[2025-07-20T19:11:12] skrtt: Cuz he is avoiding taxes
[2025-07-20T19:14:36] Dualtron Achilleus: more like china CST haha
[2025-07-20T19:14:51] Marius: idk what brand he uses
[2025-07-20T19:14:59] Marius: he always says china slicks
[2025-07-20T19:15:02] Marius: too broke for pmt
[2025-07-20T19:15:05] Unknown: yes i did exactly that
[2025-07-20T19:15:06] Dualtron Achilleus: i guess standart cst
[2025-07-20T19:15:12] Dualtron Achilleus: 6,5
[2025-07-20T19:15:17] Marius: cst makes slicks?
[2025-07-20T19:15:19] Marius: didnt know that
[2025-07-20T19:16:23] Dualtron Achilleus: no only shit nilon tire
[2025-07-20T19:16:28] Dualtron Achilleus: stradale shape
[2025-07-20T19:16:57] Marius: haku has slicks
[2025-07-20T19:16:58] Marius: so cant be cst
[2025-07-20T19:17:07] Dualtron Achilleus: on mini bike?
[2025-07-20T19:17:10] Marius: yeah
[2025-07-20T19:17:35] Marius: <photos/photo_24820@20-07-2025_19-17-35.jpg>
[2025-07-20T19:17:49] Dualtron Achilleus: hum yeah
[2025-07-20T19:17:52] Marius: peakg30 u mean
[2025-07-20T19:17:56] Marius: its not a bike
[2025-07-20T19:17:58] Dualtron Achilleus: he changed resently so
[2025-07-20T19:26:50] JPPL: No limit hardware firmware
[2025-07-20T19:27:19] JPPL: Can BE a try if we cant put more amps, dependint on Controller it can handle
[2025-07-20T20:02:20] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes on this race
[2025-07-20T20:02:50] Face de Pin Sucé: Stop pressing front brake 😂😂😂😂
[2025-07-20T20:07:59] Dualtron Achilleus: 🤣🤣 cant burn then
[2025-07-20T20:50:37] cihan: Thanks, I can try too. But you used to tell you use field weakening to reach 45 km/h. I still wonder how fast I can go without field weakening and with parallel battery at 37V for example. F2 pro can do 32km/h at 36V under load. But I'm not sure how fast it can be at 37V.
[2025-07-20T20:51:57] Face de Pin Sucé: 33kmh ? x)
[2025-07-20T20:55:55] cihan: I'm afraid of that too. :) I can either install a parallel battery now or wait for the internal battery to wear and then make a 11s or 12s battery if controller supports and continue with it. However I feel like internal battery is good enough for 15K km and I'll die before internal battery is dead.)
[2025-07-20T20:57:37] cihan: My helicoil from Temu arrived. I'll fix disc rotor screws soon before I get screwed up because of loose screws holding the rotor.
[2025-07-20T21:04:16] Unknown: yeah stock i can go 34kmh maybe
[2025-07-20T21:04:26] Unknown: no fwk
[2025-07-20T21:07:54] cihan: Resistance of motor sometimes surprises me. It's so small, little voltage difference creates lots of current.
[2025-07-20T21:11:47] cihan: Today I saw someone listing many used SNSC models but price was expensive. He was asking for 350 usd each.
[2025-07-20T21:50:25] haku: this is 22x3 yea
[2025-07-20T21:51:21] haku: <sticker>
[2025-07-20T21:52:02] Dualtron Achilleus: 40 by 2
[2025-07-20T21:52:13] haku: 40x2 dam
[2025-07-20T21:52:24] haku: didnt even know that winding existed
[2025-07-20T21:52:38] Dualtron Achilleus: me also until @PaoloWu say it
[2025-07-20T21:52:46] haku: thats the 7" ly
[2025-07-20T21:53:10] Dualtron Achilleus: yeah the mythic one
[2025-07-20T21:53:38] Dualtron Achilleus: by one you will love it
[2025-07-20T21:53:43] haku: like bigfoot and the kraken
[2025-07-20T21:54:30] haku: ive considered it before. when that was the only option for 100h
[2025-07-20T21:56:02] haku: nowadays $80 60h 21x3 motors should be enough to safisfy my needs 😭
[2025-07-20T21:56:15] haku: those motors are like 500
[2025-07-20T21:56:41] Dualtron Achilleus: haha yeah everything can be fun with good battery

[2025-07-20T23:11:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 80h max run ??? 400-500a?? 22/3
[2025-07-20T23:13:59] Dualtron Achilleus: hard to say just wacht temperatur
[2025-07-20T23:14:17] Dualtron Achilleus: and look if when you had A phase it really increase torque or only heat
[2025-07-20T23:15:53] Dualtron Achilleus: also depend the widing

[2025-07-21T19:50:54] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I ran it not for long maybe 50sec
[2025-07-21T19:53:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: @SibClimb how much you open on 22/3 80h???
[2025-07-21T19:56:22] Paolo ⁭: If the motor reached 144c it probably was around this temperature for long time
[2025-07-21T19:56:40] Paolo ⁭: The motor is sealed, no active cooling

[2025-07-21T21:25:47] skrtt: Guys i need your help figuring out whats wrong with this shit motor
[2025-07-21T21:27:31] skrtt: <video_file>
[2025-07-21T21:28:18] skrtt: Im guessing its either the rim or the bearing
[2025-07-21T21:37:11] haku: wood creeking? lol
[2025-07-21T21:37:35] haku: bearings maybe
[2025-07-21T21:39:09] skrtt: I really cant figure it out
[2025-07-21T21:39:33] skrtt: I just hope its nothing major otherwise scootee will be out until i vesc it
[2025-07-21T21:39:52] haku: diagnose dude. take motor out.
[2025-07-21T21:40:10] haku: before it gets worse. maybe just bearings
[2025-07-21T21:40:42] skrtt: Motor is out
[2025-07-21T22:20:12] Dualtron Achilleus: like all motor you can open it
[2025-07-21T22:20:13] Izuna 生活: Very off-topic and I hope it's OK to post here: If you are 18 and under and you're programming a lot, you can currently get a bunch of "free" tools and electronics through Summer Hack Club when spending hours of time programming. That's all you have to do basically. They got Pinecil Soldering Iron (just 14 hours), Raspberry Pi, Chargers and Flash Drives and a lot of actual expensive stuff (but that takes a whole lot of hours). I'm too old to participate :( - but I get tickets for referrals.
[2025-07-21T22:20:21] Dualtron Achilleus: by yoursellf
[2025-07-21T22:25:21] skrtt: He wants to know the opening needed to fit the motor
[2025-07-21T22:25:52] Dualtron Achilleus: its 176mm something like this
[2025-07-21T22:26:53] skrtt: 3,3cms more than 70h?

[2025-07-22T00:02:07] 'lekrsu': Structural integrity seems to go bye
[2025-07-22T00:02:26] Patracy: Anyone assembled a MP2 in a 150v build with watercooling?
[2025-07-22T00:04:45] Marius: thats crazy
[2025-07-22T00:06:13] Dualtron Achilleus: phoebe motor bend
[2025-07-22T00:08:42] Dualtron Achilleus: no but one guys and hight performance pev already had this issue long time ago
[2025-07-22T00:08:55] Dualtron Achilleus: benji
[2025-07-22T00:09:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: He sold me that
[2025-07-22T00:09:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Heat
[2025-07-22T00:09:29] Dualtron Achilleus: 😂😂
[2025-07-22T00:11:09] skrtt: U seem to know limits pretty good.
[2025-07-22T00:12:02] skrtt: How many phase amps before it becomes unhealthy for a 75h 33x2?
[2025-07-22T00:12:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Might have also need bad design
[2025-07-22T00:13:02] skrtt: Back to 75 🥲
[2025-07-22T00:13:27] Dualtron Achilleus: 350 /400 for 33*2
[2025-07-22T00:13:39] Yamal: Can you really see the 40mm double magnet, so are the 75h and 90h better because of the fact that their magnet is a single piece?
[2025-07-22T00:13:48] Dualtron Achilleus: after its more about heat and not much torque
[2025-07-22T00:14:34] skrtt: “Bigger” winding can handle more phase amps?
[2025-07-22T00:14:53] Yamal: I mean about magnet
[2025-07-22T00:14:57] skrtt: Like a 33x2 can handle more phase than a 22x3?
[2025-07-22T00:15:05] Marius: higher kv winding = more phase amps rrequired for same torque
[2025-07-22T00:15:08] Marius: has to
[2025-07-22T00:15:27] skrtt: Yes i know it requires.
[2025-07-22T00:15:34] skrtt: But can it handle?
[2025-07-22T00:15:50] Marius: it has to handle more, otherwise the max torque would be differnt
[2025-07-22T00:15:59] skrtt: Hmmmm
[2025-07-22T00:16:19] Marius: like if 33x2 and 22x3 both had 250a max, then 33x2 would always have way worse torque
[2025-07-22T00:16:21] skrtt: Maybe 300/350 would be the sweet spot for my 70/75 33x2
[2025-07-22T00:16:44] Dualtron Achilleus: yeah
[2025-07-22T00:17:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is 75 and 80h same stator??

[2025-07-22T00:20:22] ausias: absolutly
[2025-07-22T00:22:36] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: If 80h can't give me the turqe I want then need 90
[2025-07-22T00:23:17] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Is there 90n with split rims?
[2025-07-22T00:23:22] skrtt: Yes
[2025-07-22T00:23:35] skrtt: Why your little ass needs more torque 🤨
[2025-07-22T00:24:05] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Link for one
[2025-07-22T00:24:07] skrtt: Btw since u have the bigger suspensions why not just go for 100h
[2025-07-22T00:24:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: 100h worse then 90
[2025-07-22T00:24:32] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ask lonnyo/ @Dualtron_Achillleus

[2025-07-22T01:13:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: @SibClimb some discrimination 😉
[2025-07-22T01:13:22] haku: no america?
[2025-07-22T01:13:39] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: No Israel yes america
[2025-07-22T01:13:47] haku: oh i see
[2025-07-22T01:14:28] haku: anyways someone more intellectal than me explain how one twist a motor
[2025-07-22T01:14:47] haku: like i said ive seen that twice
[2025-07-22T01:17:10] haku: thats cool but why cant china stay away from that jank cover designs. its so tacky not classy
[2025-07-22T01:17:27] haku: need to keep it sleeper
[2025-07-22T01:20:07] skrtt: Black one is a sleeper. Double phase gives it away
[2025-07-22T01:22:46] haku: i was first sub. right yams @jamaludin_algarnati
[2025-07-22T01:22:59] skrtt: No need to flex
[2025-07-22T01:30:56] skrtt: In the back brake we trust
[2025-07-22T01:37:24] haku: atleast you have it
[2025-07-22T01:37:27] haku: hahahah
[2025-07-22T01:38:11] skrtt: Front is leaking and got air inside. Im just using it if i see a wall or a curb calling my name
[2025-07-22T01:45:32] Matthew: I am today years old to find out this kinda exists
[2025-07-22T01:50:44] haku: you know i have a theory. maybe that guy did the old switcheroo on your motors?
[2025-07-22T01:53:58] haku: before you buy 90h remember donate some shekels to the best charity organization haku industries
[2025-07-22T01:55:42] haku: charity will go to feed all the hungy jews in the US with 50pl
[2025-07-22T01:56:42] JPPL: Acabei de encontrar isso no AliExpress: 325,18€ | Makerbase controlador de veículo elétrico 100v 300a vesc benjamín esc luz motocicleta skate acessórios https://a.aliexpress.com/_EjR5GUW
[2025-07-22T03:45:03] Paolo ⁭: Can you show picture
[2025-07-22T04:11:57] Paolo ⁭: This is more factor combined
[2025-07-22T04:12:56] Paolo ⁭: It's more high temperature that melt the glue between stator core , too high current and also the double magnet
[2025-07-22T04:13:27] Paolo ⁭: But the double magnet is the smaller problem
[2025-07-22T04:14:30] Paolo ⁭: Anyway first time seeing it on escooter ahahah
[2025-07-22T04:25:50] haku: can it be a bad batch of motors from factory?
[2025-07-22T04:28:15] Paolo ⁭: Nope , not first time seeing that but normally happens on high power motors for moto
[2025-07-22T04:30:33] haku: i must protect my babies from high heat.
[2025-07-22T04:49:24] Paolo ⁭: All double magnet 😭
[2025-07-22T04:51:39] haku: haha
[2025-07-22T04:53:18] Paolo ⁭: Let .e know how much lonyyo ask you for new stator, because magnets has lost power , so if it's not worth don't buy
[2025-07-22T04:53:31] haku: LY said they have a 11" 60h with 130 axle openings. but that be expensive im sure
[2025-07-22T04:54:24] Paolo ⁭: It's just a 135mm version with reduced axle
[2025-07-22T04:56:03] haku: i see
[2025-07-22T04:56:34] haku: its it thick phases or regular thin noodle phases?
[2025-07-22T05:46:10] Yamal: Also 100h have doble magnet ?
[2025-07-22T05:47:02] Yamal: Maybe 90h could be a good option for the next time you have to buy engines
[2025-07-22T05:49:21] Face de Pin Sucé: I don't know, never use 22x3 for 80H
[2025-07-22T05:49:26] haku: not i. maybe @shlomda2
[2025-07-22T05:49:45] Face de Pin Sucé: With what controller do you push 450A to this motor ?
[2025-07-22T05:50:03] haku: at that pricepoint ill just mount a qs motor on a bmx
[2025-07-22T05:50:44] haku: flipsky i think
[2025-07-22T05:51:52] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes I've seen it a lot on LY motors Sadly nothing really to do, but motor still works, you loose a little of torque That is one of the reasons we make our own motors x)
[2025-07-22T05:52:15] haku: btw. @SibClimb ambriosini is coming for my championship titles. they are coming to the US
[2025-07-22T05:52:28] haku: help me defend my belt
[2025-07-22T05:55:10] haku: his motors reached 141 degree is that okay?
[2025-07-22T05:55:27] Face de Pin Sucé: That is weird, we have sent to Israel before, was available, remind me during the day, I'll look
[2025-07-22T05:56:28] Yamal: Is a lot ?
[2025-07-22T05:56:38] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, but it's old technology end of 2023
[2025-07-22T05:57:36] Yamal: 80h33/2 really cool
[2025-07-22T05:57:49] Yamal: Torque and high speed
[2025-07-22T05:58:13] Face de Pin Sucé: No, single magnet
[2025-07-22T05:58:26] Yamal: Nice to know
[2025-07-22T05:58:45] Face de Pin Sucé: What ?
[2025-07-22T05:58:59] skrtt: They shipped a nami to the us
[2025-07-22T05:59:18] Face de Pin Sucé: They did a post ?
[2025-07-22T05:59:36] skrtt: I think stories
[2025-07-22T05:59:58] Face de Pin Sucé: Oh, can't see, Ambrosini blocked my accounts on Instagram, don't know why 😂
[2025-07-22T06:00:13] skrtt: They jealous eheheh
[2025-07-22T06:00:32] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, they don't have to be, they win all races 😂
[2025-07-22T06:00:35] Yamal: You use before 80h in competition, push 400A phase right ?
[2025-07-22T06:00:42] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2025-07-22T06:00:52] skrtt: Ly or costum?
[2025-07-22T06:01:04] Face de Pin Sucé: Thibaud used 80H last year
[2025-07-22T06:01:17] Face de Pin Sucé: His stator is twisted too now
[2025-07-22T06:01:29] Yamal: Crazy…
[2025-07-22T06:01:46] Yamal: But all about the doble magnet ?
[2025-07-22T06:04:02] Face de Pin Sucé: No, I've seen with 70 and 75H tol
[2025-07-22T06:04:03] Face de Pin Sucé: Too
[2025-07-22T06:04:51] Face de Pin Sucé: When it comes to racing, standard high performance products are not perfect
[2025-07-22T06:05:12] Face de Pin Sucé: That's why we manufacture our own motors
[2025-07-22T06:05:17] Face de Pin Sucé: Including stator
[2025-07-22T06:05:52] Yamal: I really had no idea about this, if I had known I would have asked for 75 or 90 h instead of 80 h . In the end, the prices are more or less the same.
[2025-07-22T06:06:07] skrtt: Even with big error margins?
[2025-07-22T06:06:23] Face de Pin Sucé: What do you mean ?
[2025-07-22T06:07:13] skrtt: Try to make something capable of “way more” than it’s supposed to
[2025-07-22T06:09:58] Face de Pin Sucé: That's what we do with our motors designed for racing
[2025-07-22T06:10:21] Face de Pin Sucé: Huge amount of torque, low temperature
[2025-07-22T06:10:42] Face de Pin Sucé: We would need to push a lot more to start having troubles
[2025-07-22T06:10:57] Face de Pin Sucé: (we would need better drivers to win races too)😂
[2025-07-22T06:11:27] skrtt: U planning on a production for the outside?
[2025-07-22T06:12:04] Face de Pin Sucé: But RM-X 2025 is 3.7s in racing setup for 0-100kmh, could be 3.5s if maxxed parameters with current setup, but it needs to be drivable in corners
[2025-07-22T06:12:24] Face de Pin Sucé: 2025 motor isn't planned to be produced
[2025-07-22T06:12:51] Face de Pin Sucé: It's too much work to assemble one
[2025-07-22T06:14:06] haku: i just found out recently you guys are competitors. just wanted to inform you as an informer
[2025-07-22T06:14:25] skrtt: Im waiting to see what comes in 2026 😌
[2025-07-22T06:17:09] Yamal: I imagine you normally use traction control, otherwise it's almost impossible to drive without skidding.
[2025-07-22T06:19:12] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes, traction control is mandatory
[2025-07-22T06:19:24] Face de Pin Sucé: If you have screenshot I'm happy to see
[2025-07-22T06:20:27] Yamal: doing less than 5" from 0-100 is really amazing
[2025-07-22T06:20:28] haku: <photos/photo_24835@21-07-2025_14-12-25.jpg>
[2025-07-22T06:22:07] haku: they cannot conquer the US. las vegas will be the battle ground
[2025-07-22T06:22:22] haku: i will hold the line boys
[2025-07-22T06:22:51] Face de Pin Sucé: Is there some races planned in US ?
[2025-07-22T06:23:01] haku: no idea tbh lol
[2025-07-22T06:23:09] Face de Pin Sucé: I've seen something at beginning of July, but it seemed small
[2025-07-22T06:23:26] haku: maybe so. i have to look it up
[2025-07-22T06:23:29] Face de Pin Sucé: "pure torque" is quite funny actually x)
[2025-07-22T06:24:14] haku: they use LY factory motors yea?
[2025-07-22T06:24:29] haku: but the g300 controllers modded?
[2025-07-22T06:24:43] Face de Pin Sucé: https://www.instagram.com/p/DKdj5IPpvUw/?igsh=MWV0c3M1ZnFrZHUxYQ==
[2025-07-22T06:24:56] Face de Pin Sucé: G300 with Ambrosini writing
[2025-07-22T06:25:00] Face de Pin Sucé: Nothing modded
[2025-07-22T06:25:06] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes
[2025-07-22T06:25:37] haku: oh yea these guys. just alien rides promo. nothing serious like in france
[2025-07-22T06:26:42] Face de Pin Sucé: Okay that's what I thought
[2025-07-22T06:26:54] Face de Pin Sucé: But it's nice that something comes from them at least
[2025-07-22T06:28:28] Face de Pin Sucé: https://www.instagram.com/p/DMTMcTVSoPj/?igsh=czl6enJxZHd5bWds
[2025-07-22T06:28:36] Face de Pin Sucé: Something in october is happening
[2025-07-22T06:29:27] Face de Pin Sucé: Oh it's Canada ?
[2025-07-22T06:35:51] haku: north california maybe
[2025-07-22T06:36:15] haku: yea sonoma CA

[2025-07-22T06:53:56] Yamal: 0-100
[2025-07-22T06:55:04] Yamal: Voltage no good in the graph ,, don’t know why maybe a lot of parameter for 1 graph
[2025-07-22T06:56:29] Yamal: Or maybe it's fine but you can't see the voltage drop well.
[2025-07-22T07:03:35] haku: gadam yams. not 1 single day missed. balls to walls logs and gps
[2025-07-22T07:04:10] Yamal: GPS no
[2025-07-22T07:04:15] Yamal: Only VESC tool
[2025-07-22T07:04:42] haku: well at 30kw on 33x2 i believe it
[2025-07-22T07:05:35] Yamal: For me no real” 30kw they are peak
[2025-07-22T07:05:53] Face de Pin Sucé: Interesting, are you going there ?
[2025-07-22T07:10:46] haku: we will see
[2025-07-22T07:14:17] haku: your motor temps stay cool too. good tune

[2025-07-22T07:17:23] леон: yeah
[2025-07-22T07:17:31] леон: but idk if it was like that
[2025-07-22T07:17:52] леон: i was not overheating it over 80° at this moment
[2025-07-22T07:18:05] haku: crazy
[2025-07-22T07:18:29] леон: and that 60h after 500amps
[2025-07-22T07:18:50] леон: works fine
[2025-07-22T07:19:23] haku: 500a on a 60h you crazy
[2025-07-22T07:19:29] haku: 22x3?
[2025-07-22T07:19:34] леон: not overheating that much
[2025-07-22T07:19:36] леон: nope
[2025-07-22T07:20:16] леон: there is 0-100 with this 60H
[2025-07-22T07:20:19] леон: 1 motor
[2025-07-22T07:21:04] haku: thats a lonnyo?
[2025-07-22T07:21:08] леон: nope
[2025-07-22T07:21:39] леон: but after that looks like new
[2025-07-22T07:21:50] леон: used it like that for 7 months
[2025-07-22T07:26:45] haku: you guys are wild running 500a
[2025-07-22T07:27:56] haku: why not use fw instead?
[2025-07-22T07:28:07] haku: on 22x3
[2025-07-22T07:28:14] леон: what is fw
[2025-07-22T07:28:23] haku: field weakening
[2025-07-22T07:28:53] леон: we want more torque
[2025-07-22T07:28:59] haku: i see
[2025-07-22T07:29:05] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Hey @DRAGON_PEET @SibClimb @jamessoderstrom @PaoloWu @Dualtron_Achillleus now problem I have long time is bzzzzzz(/brrrrrrr) feeling when accelerating sometimes and scooter can feel it a lot
[2025-07-22T07:29:22] леон: im using fw too
[2025-07-22T07:29:32] леон: on 60h
[2025-07-22T07:29:48] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But I don't remember if it was after or before I pushed 350+
[2025-07-22T07:29:54] haku: 33x2 with fw?
[2025-07-22T07:30:04] леон: its not 33x2

[2025-07-22T07:30:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Results from today morning
[2025-07-22T07:30:53] леон: idk its more torque than 22x3 but lower high speed
[2025-07-22T07:31:08] леон: without fw did 107kmh
[2025-07-22T07:31:17] леон: on 1 motor
[2025-07-22T07:31:38] леон: what bout torque?
[2025-07-22T07:31:50] леон: and now its more heating?
[2025-07-22T07:32:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: But still stuck with the bzzzzzzt feeling
[2025-07-22T07:32:16] haku: well ill be using 60h 21x3 for the first time. thats my next build. need all the advice
[2025-07-22T07:32:20] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: You can see there how long I drove
[2025-07-22T07:32:39] леон: 3km?
[2025-07-22T07:32:51] леон: and after that 90°
[2025-07-22T07:32:55] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Off the line is less a bit but when start rolling have goodish acceleration
[2025-07-22T07:33:11] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes I didn't turn it off since start ride
[2025-07-22T07:33:23] haku: i want burnouts all day everyday. rolling burnouts of possible
[2025-07-22T07:35:23] леон: <video_file>
[2025-07-22T07:40:02] Yamal: 100h rear 90h front 1000A phase 500A battery Posible ?
[2025-07-22T07:40:12] Yamal: 😆
[2025-07-22T07:40:43] леон: nope
[2025-07-22T07:41:12] леон: bigger motor for 1000amps
[2025-07-22T07:41:20] Paolo ⁭: 500a each
[2025-07-22T07:41:25] леон: oh, yea sure
[2025-07-22T07:46:18] Yamal: Paolo know 🤙⚡️
[2025-07-22T07:46:28] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-07-22T07:46:29] haku: what is axle opening for 90h and 100h?
[2025-07-22T07:46:41] Face de Pin Sucé: Could be magnets unglued
[2025-07-22T07:46:46] haku: 180mm?
[2025-07-22T07:54:50] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: I opened no magnet unplugged
[2025-07-22T07:54:55] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: <video_file>
[2025-07-22T08:05:26] Face de Pin Sucé: That doesn't mean they are not unglued
[2025-07-22T08:05:41] Face de Pin Sucé: You need to take wood and hammer to check
[2025-07-22T08:36:22] 'lekrsu': They're held in place by the orientation themselves if one's unglued.
[2025-07-22T08:41:59] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes but when pushing torque, they move a little and it makes a noise
[2025-07-22T08:42:05] Face de Pin Sucé: I've seen that many times before
[2025-07-22T09:01:23] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Then they should move if I push easy with screwdriver?
[2025-07-22T09:01:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Also can I get stator from u since you say it "custom"
[2025-07-22T09:06:25] Face de Pin Sucé: Kilian is french and a lot better driver than Jordi
[2025-07-22T09:07:01] Yamal: In send you message:)
[2025-07-22T09:10:00] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: @SibClimb is your 90h same as lonnyo just split rim? Or it's different size/winding stator
[2025-07-22T09:30:30] Paolo ⁭: No problem, today vw owns all of these supercar

[2025-07-22T09:46:01] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: The easiest it can be done Is maybe shipping stator rim etc separately every part
[2025-07-22T09:46:12] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Then wouldn't classify as motor
[2025-07-22T09:48:02] Face de Pin Sucé: Oh woaw
[2025-07-22T09:48:07] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: However I think it's a headache for seller to do no?
[2025-07-22T09:49:05] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: People have and do ship to here full motors but from china and if it's from eu you want to be the safest u can

[2025-07-23T21:07:41] JPPL: Makerx website update yesterday firmware page, they added K900 firmware, i neves heard about it but seems new Controller because firmware is 6.05 only

[2025-07-23T21:22:51] Yamal: Hi group, this guy finds that his Nami isn't reaching very high watts even though he's configured with a 170A battery and 200A phase. Do you know what could be the cause?
[2025-07-23T21:25:34] Yamal: Is like the maximum watts can get
[2025-07-23T21:27:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Q1 pro
[2025-07-23T21:31:28] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I think so, but have you tried it with a fully charged battery?
[2025-07-23T21:34:42] JPPL: <photos/photo_24884@23-07-2025_21-34-42.jpg>
[2025-07-23T21:34:49] JPPL: New PMT
[2025-07-23T22:08:34] Yamal: Full battery I think
[2025-07-23T22:36:48] haku: ooh armadillo threads. is it for rain?
[2025-07-23T22:46:50] Dualtron Achilleus: Reached 330a phase for the first time!🥰(single motor)
[2025-07-23T22:56:56] Matthew: What motor are you using?
[2025-07-23T22:57:27] Dualtron Achilleus: speed is wrong
[2025-07-23T22:57:38] Dualtron Achilleus: 90h 127 mm as always
[2025-07-23T22:57:40] Matthew: What frame/model is that?
[2025-07-23T22:58:25] Matthew: What speed did you get to ?
[2025-07-23T22:58:44] Dualtron Achilleus: its less that this i guess
[2025-07-23T22:58:51] Matthew: What opening is the dropout for your motor?
[2025-07-23T22:59:01] Dualtron Achilleus: idk is set 260mm wheel size but seens so fast to be real
[2025-07-23T22:59:15] Dualtron Achilleus: 180mm something like this
[2025-07-23T22:59:16] Matthew: Cool cool. Just wondering if speed was close even though not accurate
[2025-07-23T22:59:33] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Fiido q1 with extended fixed arms
[2025-07-23T23:02:21] Matthew: I got you. I am wanting to figure something out for my yume y11+. The factory motors i thought would perform significantly better and I guess 100phase is about all theyre happy with. So with that I am wanting a much more torque-y motor. I am guessing lonnyo be decent with 142mm dropout... don't know magnet size though
[2025-07-23T23:03:01] Dualtron Achilleus: 142mm is to narrow
[2025-07-23T23:03:41] Matthew: Washers each side filling open space though and I dont have calipers to measure.
[2025-07-23T23:05:03] Matthew: I was wondering if a 75h or 80h would be a nice motor to use. I really dont need faster speed than ~50mph. I have spintend 85250 to use. I am on 16s 180battery
[2025-07-23T23:05:30] Matthew: Love it
[2025-07-23T23:06:02] Matthew: That's why I ask... your acceleration is wild hehe!
[2025-07-23T23:06:13] Dualtron Achilleus: there is 80H with 155mm dropout
[2025-07-23T23:07:04] Dualtron Achilleus: yeah wild need to put whole body weight on front
[2025-07-23T23:07:18] Dualtron Achilleus: but speed is exagerate here
[2025-07-23T23:07:52] Matthew: Road tire is lonnyo 65h 22x3 125mm dropout and big one is yume y11+ motor
[2025-07-23T23:08:17] Matthew: Nice nice!
[2025-07-23T23:15:24] Dualtron Achilleus: you want single or dual build
[2025-07-23T23:22:33] Matthew: Single rwd
[2025-07-23T23:23:08] Dualtron Achilleus: 65H 22by3 on single will heat too much
[2025-07-23T23:24:23] Dualtron Achilleus: my 75H lonyo 22by3 at 130phase was getting hot in single
[2025-07-23T23:27:21] Matthew: Isn't max possible around 23kw? I would think he should be able to pull some more out of the setup but not much more. Wonder what voltage drop it is getting if that's much happening there.
[2025-07-23T23:30:33] Matthew: I have ran 16s 260 phase on my 65h 22x3 motor but it has statorade in it which helps significantly but temps just keep going up if I am going 40mph... 35mph with statorade stays more stable and not get hotter. Recently been using my 65h 17x4 motor and its a solid low powered setup. Next I want to have proper wheelie making power for my yume y11+
[2025-07-23T23:31:23] Dualtron Achilleus: the torque was nice?
[2025-07-23T23:33:12] Matthew: Yes, I just had to make sure I was rolling just a little bit before going full throttle but not much... but if full power from stop the motor saturates and yeah... but makes the ride enjoyable. When I was stuck at 150amps phase the 65h 22x3 was extremely lackluster
[2025-07-23T23:34:12] Matthew: Full charge 90amps battery 260 phase and was around 8kw.
[2025-07-23T23:34:49] Dualtron Achilleus: good
[2025-07-23T23:35:05] Dualtron Achilleus: i will try to have the right speed and send it here
[2025-07-23T23:35:16] Dualtron Achilleus: but i have 75 also
[2025-07-23T23:35:23] Dualtron Achilleus: 75H 22by3
[2025-07-23T23:35:33] Dualtron Achilleus: when i juped to 90H
[2025-07-23T23:35:38] Dualtron Achilleus: i was chocked
[2025-07-23T23:35:41] Matthew: Pretty fun! I just really don't have much interests in going faster than like 55mph
[2025-07-23T23:36:13] Matthew: Significantly more powerful i take it?
[2025-07-23T23:36:24] Dualtron Achilleus: yeah same my goal inst to go 70mph
[2025-07-23T23:37:00] Dualtron Achilleus: i tryed both at 130 phase only cuz was stocb battery
[2025-07-23T23:37:21] Matthew: Yeah, thats fast haha. Id like the power to know i can go that fast but likely would not be trying to find out vmax
[2025-07-23T23:37:21] Dualtron Achilleus: 90h 127 mm smoked 75h 110mm
[2025-07-23T23:37:34] Matthew: Nice
[2025-07-23T23:37:35] Dualtron Achilleus: the torque is like 45% more
[2025-07-23T23:38:16] Matthew: Thats wild. And you fit avg 100/65-6.5?
[2025-07-23T23:38:18] Dualtron Achilleus: i will put 75 on the back again to try
[2025-07-23T23:38:20] Matthew: Tire*
[2025-07-23T23:38:22] Dualtron Achilleus: i will tell you
[2025-07-23T23:38:42] Dualtron Achilleus: 75h yeah
[2025-07-23T23:38:49] Dualtron Achilleus: 90h need 7inch tire
[2025-07-23T23:39:00] Matthew: Got you.
[2025-07-23T23:39:39] Matthew: Some day soon ill be able to get the yume straight the way i want
[2025-07-23T23:39:57] Dualtron Achilleus: hope for you
[2025-07-23T23:43:27] Matthew: My lp is basically done. It will just get fine touches to make everything going on there more clean and functional. I just need to run some wires to my busbar to power accessories and stuff. Orange bag has a tire repair kit along with a new tire, a regular tire pump, and air shock pump.
[2025-07-23T23:43:57] Dualtron Achilleus: ho no you put a seat..
[2025-07-23T23:44:18] Dualtron Achilleus: that yume here or another
[2025-07-23T23:44:26] Dualtron Achilleus: i dont know every model
[2025-07-23T23:52:14] Matthew: This guy is gonna be the speedforks build and all the other stuff you guys have designed. Gonna run 65h 22x3 with p30b internal 15ah 120amps nominal and 200amps burst from amorge or maybe see if haku industries would take on the job of making me a battery pack.
[2025-07-23T23:58:35] haku: <video_file>
[2025-07-23T23:58:46] haku: self drive is so good now.
[2025-07-24T00:18:50] Matthew: Haha, how's @Bradhaku say non anus exposed Americans haha
[2025-07-24T00:18:50] Matthew: The orange bag one is g30lp.
[2025-07-24T00:18:50] Matthew: The regular g30p is whats getting all the expensive goodies...
[2025-07-24T00:18:51] Matthew: This is whats in the works yume y11+
[2025-07-24T00:26:54] Rose: Hey there Patrick, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-07-24T00:46:54] Matthew: Is the amps ok for 100/100? Im on 16s 85 battery 110phase 30 amps field weakening @90% 65h 17x4
[2025-07-24T00:48:03] 'lekrsu': 0 is doable, but that means zero delay.
[2025-07-24T00:49:06] 'lekrsu': High fet temps, otherwise fine
[2025-07-24T00:55:33] Matthew: Had a heavy headwind and was pushing close to full throttle for a few miles and then I decided to go up the more or less steepest hill in town. The scooter weighs ~100lbs and I weigh with my backpack on ~200lbs.
[2025-07-24T00:55:54] Matthew: Temps drop quick
[2025-07-24T00:57:20] 'lekrsu': Not inoperable amounts of torque at that wattage
[2025-07-24T00:57:44] 'lekrsu': Can actually drive full throttle on some stretches I suppose
[2025-07-24T00:58:00] Matthew: <photos/photo_24892@24-07-2025_00-58-00.jpg>
[2025-07-24T00:58:00] Matthew: Went from 52°c to 39°c in 1 minute. I have liquid cooling but didnt think the vesc would get that hot.
[2025-07-24T01:18:53] haku: those motors on the yume i like man. same ones i have on peak.g30
[2025-07-24T01:20:26] Arnau Martinez Casals: Only works well with traction control🙃
[2025-07-24T02:02:19] haku: i have a few p42s left for a g30 build. just need to order bms
[2025-07-24T02:08:03] 'lekrsu': That's actually an insane choice
[2025-07-24T02:10:27] Noname: https://www.facebook.com/reel/1129198935778270/?mibextid=9drbnH
[2025-07-24T02:29:32] haku: enough
[2025-07-24T02:29:56] haku: less than 200 enough for g30
[2025-07-24T02:31:05] haku: its suppose to make a u turn but it pussied out haha
[2025-07-24T02:32:22] haku: thats peak investment. batteries
[2025-07-24T02:34:46] haku: once the end of days come. the man with batteries and ammo will be king
[2025-07-24T02:37:12] 'lekrsu': Batteries can serve both purposes
[2025-07-24T02:50:12] Noname: Anyone have a 3d print file for 18650 sabot round?
[2025-07-24T02:50:35] Noname: Think that'd be like dragons breath round if full charged

[2025-07-24T04:57:32] haku: holy shit dudes! someone ran on a scooter. gadam. bloody scene.
[2025-07-24T04:58:20] haku: boys see that bloody towel. rip
[2025-07-24T05:00:15] Unknown: front wheel still spinning?
[2025-07-24T05:00:21] haku: gadam vegas is the devils anus indeed
[2025-07-24T05:00:27] haku: gotta be cafeful
[2025-07-24T05:00:27] Unknown: is the driver alright?
[2025-07-24T05:00:52] haku: they are taping it off like a crime scene
[2025-07-24T05:00:59] Unknown: damn he flew across the street
[2025-07-24T05:01:13] haku: yea
[2025-07-24T05:01:29] haku: they blocked the whole street
[2025-07-24T05:01:58] haku: i think ive seen that kid before too. he drives on the opposite lane
[2025-07-24T05:03:04] haku: always something in my hood. gotta be careful
[2025-07-24T05:24:20] Noname: Damn wheel still spinning
[2025-07-24T05:25:08] Noname: How tf do you not see a car there ain't no bushes or anything in the way
[2025-07-24T05:26:03] Unknown: Hey i said that
[2025-07-24T05:26:20] Noname: Hey I said that
[2025-07-24T05:28:31] Noname: https://youtube.com/shorts/Jp0WcyU-lKU?si=vUjg54StDG0O7gxv @Supremeavocado225
[2025-07-24T05:34:05] haku: if i know who i think who this kid is. hes reckless. i see him when i drive
[2025-07-24T05:34:27] haku: may he rip
[2025-07-24T05:35:12] Noname: Reckless on a 12mph scoot?
[2025-07-24T05:35:32] haku: also i asked cops what new ebike/scooter laws are. anything that goes over 35mph is fucked
[2025-07-24T05:35:47] haku: he carves corners on the other side without looking
[2025-07-24T05:36:10] haku: retarded move with all due respect.
[2025-07-24T05:38:13] haku: he rides heading towards traffic and carving corners without looking
[2025-07-24T05:38:42] haku: yes hes black. if thats what your thinking.
[2025-07-24T05:55:19] Yamal: There is a problem with e-scooters, and that is their easy access, and then you find many people driving on the roads who are not car or motorcycle drivers and therefore do not know anything about the highway code
[2025-07-24T05:55:42] Yamal: I mean traffic regulations
[2025-07-24T05:55:50] haku: agreed. i talked to the cop about this. kids dont know
[2025-07-24T05:56:13] haku: i also snitched on a few surron boys
[2025-07-24T05:56:55] haku: he told me exactly how they trap em lmao
[2025-07-24T05:57:52] haku: im a rat. thats right. stone cold snitch
[2025-07-24T05:58:28] Yamal: snitches don't usually end up well xD
[2025-07-24T06:00:23] haku: we will see. i sing like a bird
[2025-07-24T06:00:50] Yamal: 🫣

[2025-07-24T06:07:41] Yamal: Also waiting to upload your project to the channel
[2025-07-24T06:09:24] Yamal: Battery -? Motor? Esc ?
[2025-07-24T06:09:37] Yamal: I will take some picture from this group
[2025-07-24T06:09:50] Yamal: But need the VESC tool data
[2025-07-24T06:11:14] Yamal: Molicel 20s3p 50h 16/4 100/100 dual ubox ?
[2025-07-24T06:13:05] haku: thats right i forgot. i will take some professional looking photos yams.
[2025-07-24T06:13:16] haku: remember its called peak g30
[2025-07-24T06:14:06] Yamal: Okay

[2025-07-24T06:45:22] KierreKikkeli: I have surfaced from my hole yet again, Tl;dr: Old vesc settings and setup with a 12s 20a battery , ubox 100v 80A, Vsett 10+ motor goes around 35-45kmh Every time i re do em it cuts my speed off by half, and testing field weakening produced no results but made the motor spin scarily fast, i have also set the wheel size to 255mm as using 10x2.5 or 10x3 tires.. Like the rpm sounds similiar but it only goes around 20-24kmh on air.... Any ideas what might be the problem?
[2025-07-24T06:49:05] KierreKikkeli: My motor wire broke so i had to fix it... And re do the setup as i cant use the old one.... I tried tho and it went the usual 60kmh on air but started complaining about abs over load current, shut off, and killed my hall sensor im guessing as it cant be found anymore by the software but everything seems fine physically
[2025-07-24T06:50:26] KierreKikkeli: Like what kind of black magic did Happy, izuna and mirono do to it when i was learning and they remoted in to do the setup xd

[2025-07-24T07:07:45] Noname: You dont even need to understand rules of the road. Do you get run over by shopping carriages?
[2025-07-24T07:07:58] Noname: How?
[2025-07-24T07:11:54] haku: they chase em and over that new bridge the just built. theres no escape. then they trap em on the other side haha.
[2025-07-24T07:12:50] haku: patrol cars waiting on the other side. they get blocked in. the thing is with these surron boys they ride the same streets everytime
[2025-07-24T07:13:44] KierreKikkeli: .........
[2025-07-24T07:13:57] haku: now i know not to get on that bridge. see peak g30 i can talk to cops they think its a clown bike

[2025-07-24T13:49:10] Yamal: Is Teverun want or Ly classic ? XD
[2025-07-24T13:49:20] Yamal: Interesting about this engine
[2025-07-24T14:03:06] Dualtron Achilleus: I think it is
[2025-07-24T14:03:19] Dualtron Achilleus: That because there is 40magnet and not 30 i guess
[2025-07-24T14:03:42] Dualtron Achilleus: 25KV motor so its slow top speed
[2025-07-24T14:04:24] Dualtron Achilleus: Teverun 7260r is 33*2 motor but 60h magnet
[2025-07-24T14:06:34] Yamal: But yours is 90h
[2025-07-24T14:06:43] Yamal: And the look same Teverum!
[2025-07-24T14:06:58] Yamal: But true teverum one 60h
[2025-07-24T14:07:33] Dualtron Achilleus: I noticed that mine is larger a bit
[2025-07-24T14:08:02] Dualtron Achilleus: On the 7260 the motor shape is same size as the rims
[2025-07-24T14:08:32] Dualtron Achilleus: On mine the motor is a bit wider
[2025-07-24T14:12:08] Yamal: How the beast going
[2025-07-24T14:12:23] Yamal: Never mount the another motor
[2025-07-24T14:12:28] Yamal: And second Esc

[2025-07-24T16:11:35] JPPL: What is comming!
[2025-07-24T16:26:26] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes
[2025-07-24T17:03:24] Dualtron Achilleus: Spec?
[2025-07-24T17:34:45] bricobi5: Is anyone interested in a promo code for the Flipsky website?
[2025-07-24T18:39:57] KierreKikkeli: Did i kill the vesc with either 20a field weakening with a 20a battery, or by my shitty wire fixing job on the motor?
[2025-07-24T18:40:17] KierreKikkeli: Moments before it did this it would just beep loud as fuck, so i tried to connect it to the pc to see whats up with it but now it wont even turn on :c Edit: battery fuse is all ok so its not that
[2025-07-24T18:50:40] KierreKikkeli: Did i burn the capacitors on it??
[2025-07-24T19:21:57] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I don't know how sensitive it is, but it doesn't indicate the pedestrian's speed.
[2025-07-24T19:34:20] KierreKikkeli: Got it to beep again
[2025-07-24T19:43:07] KierreKikkeli: Indeed, wondering how tf as there has never been moisture inside?
[2025-07-24T19:43:13] KierreKikkeli: And i keep it in my apt
[2025-07-24T19:46:16] 'lekrsu': Looks like the caps & screws took a trip in the ocean
[2025-07-24T19:46:36] KierreKikkeli: Ah now i know.... winter
[2025-07-24T19:48:06] 'lekrsu': Xiaomi was never that protected against ingress to begin with, usually a puddle in there
[2025-07-24T20:06:51] KierreKikkeli: God damn telegram x and sub groups xd
[2025-07-24T20:07:31] KierreKikkeli: "Yuup, so the caps are likely the issue? As in corrosion and then i redid the motors wires inside and blew the caps
[2025-07-24T20:16:46] Matthew: I need to give the motors a bit more chance once I get a new tire on it. When I was pushing off getting a little speed before giving throttle I noticed it moved pretty well. But trying to take off from dead stop single motor flat tire it would just keep saying overcurrent and not even going. I even ran .5 sec upramp and progressively more and more throttle and overcurrent. I dont know what would be other than just too much load with a person like me that weighs 200lbs and scooter has to be ~150lbs now with the second battery pack and waterproof box.
[2025-07-24T20:28:10] Yamal: <sticker>
[2025-07-24T20:29:23] haku: yamal mentor this segway kids on how to balls to walls all day everyday. they must know

[2025-07-24T20:41:03] Matthew: Dude, ive seen horrible. Red light. Crosswalk light was on go for the people crossing. Dude rolled through with his scooter and someone going like 50mph hit the dude. He flew like 20' in the air flipping. He hit the ground and moved a little bit and that was it. Blood started to puddle underneath him pretty quick. There's absolutely no way that kid lived. And hit and run. Hoping the intersection had cameras and they catch the people and they go to jail for life.
[2025-07-24T20:42:26] Matthew: Do they need to run dual motor to operate ideally?
[2025-07-24T20:45:48] Yamal: What happen with Segway group man
[2025-07-24T20:46:22] Yamal: You can do normal gps and cut later

[2025-07-25T00:59:38] Noname: When the hay tractor stops for gas you know its a small town
[2025-07-25T01:30:55] Yamal: For me it's not 32kw real output xD
[2025-07-25T01:31:07] Unknown: haku said 32kW tho
[2025-07-25T01:32:14] Yamal: 32 was once "peak peaks" so to speak
[2025-07-25T01:35:04] Yamal: For 20s, 450A of total battery power is needed to have 32kw of battery power and controllers that demand it xD
[2025-07-25T01:35:09] Unknown: 32 is 32
[2025-07-25T01:45:54] haku: thats just being humble yams

[2025-07-25T01:55:03] haku: ask james if you can push it more. im sure its possible
[2025-07-25T01:55:25] Yamal: And I'm also looking forward to removing the traction control to unleash the beast.

[2025-07-25T06:44:29] Yamal: I need to remove the traction control, soon, the beast awaits
[2025-07-25T06:44:40] haku: beast indeed
[2025-07-25T06:44:59] haku: you have proven it time and time again

[2025-07-25T06:52:42] Yamal: One controller Ubox 85/250V1
[2025-07-25T06:57:06] Yamal: I mean that they are data from my rear controller, the master "where I have the Bluetooth module connected"
[2025-07-25T09:40:32] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: the g300 doesn't work well or it's not suitable for 22s I can't go up more than 320 phase or I have the problems that you know well for me in operation it's better I don't mean how you are if not working schul I could put 400 phase and 200 battery without any problem in this one I can't put more than 320 🥲
[2025-07-25T09:47:53] Dualtron Achilleus: What setting you set?
[2025-07-25T09:47:59] Dualtron Achilleus: Current
[2025-07-25T09:52:08] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <video_file>
[2025-07-25T09:53:37] Dualtron Achilleus: Did you try like 400phase and 500absolute?
[2025-07-25T10:05:08] Rose: Hey there Unlatch, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-07-25T10:07:47] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It can't be done, it saturates the engines, it doesn't work well
[2025-07-25T10:10:39] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: With 380 phase and 200 battery it doesn't work well. I tried to lower the battery to compensate with the phase but it doesn't work. This controller isn't very good but the scooter works.
[2025-07-25T10:12:44] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: With 20s I think it will work well but with 22s I don't see it working well.
[2025-07-25T10:16:21] Dualtron Achilleus: No parameter to compensante saturation?
[2025-07-25T10:17:12] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: The experts know that, I'm a beginner.
[2025-07-25T10:18:00] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: could it work with unlimited fw I don't know
[2025-07-25T10:30:46] Dualtron Achilleus: Install it
[2025-07-25T10:31:07] Dualtron Achilleus: I will try my g300 in one week i will tell you if same
[2025-07-25T10:34:10] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I think I sent you the unlimited fw, install it so we'll have different data
[2025-07-25T10:34:30] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah
[2025-07-25T10:46:01] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: will you use 20s or 22s?
[2025-07-25T10:50:12] Dualtron Achilleus: 21^
[2025-07-25T10:50:40] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Jijiji
[2025-07-25T11:12:22] Face de Pin Sucé: G300 isn't suited for 22S
[2025-07-25T11:12:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Sometimes it works well
[2025-07-25T11:12:32] Face de Pin Sucé: Sometimes not
[2025-07-25T11:12:39] Face de Pin Sucé: That's why we don't sell this
[2025-07-25T11:12:46] Face de Pin Sucé: (despite the heating problems )
[2025-07-25T11:17:27] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, well, but the ones you sell don't have good components. Every controller has some problem, but I will put back the ones you sell. If everything continues like this, I can't raise the phase with your controller. There is no problem putting 200 battery 400 phase. Now I can't raise the phase to have more power. I am a little limited with G300.
[2025-07-25T11:25:10] Dualtron Achilleus: 3shul bad components?
[2025-07-25T11:33:40] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Several people told me this
[2025-07-25T11:39:14] bricobi5: TER core
[2025-07-25T11:46:51] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, I sold like 300 this year, if I had problems with those controllers, I wouldn't sell nor use these on my racing scooters/customer scooters When wiring is right (on all scooter, including phases not touching frame, hall sensors, ...) and parameters well done, those controllers never die, I have scooters running with same C350 from April 2023 (that were at coma-ruga first race in spain) and they did 2023 all races, 2024 all races and many many many rides here in Lyon, scooter is around 10 000km with it
[2025-07-25T11:47:06] Face de Pin Sucé: But I agree that CL1000 seem to have some problems depending on batches
[2025-07-25T11:47:57] Face de Pin Sucé: C350 is the most solid 12 fets in this size that I know, and trust me, if I could stop working with 3Shul, I would, but there is no controllers equal in performance, reliability and size on market
[2025-07-25T11:56:29] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: You know a lot more about components. I'm just sharing the information that several people gave me.
[2025-07-25T11:57:05] Yamal: Why do you say if you could stop working with 3shull, you would do it?
[2025-07-25T11:58:53] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: But I repeat, if I continue with the problems, I will put your controllers back on. They never heated up more than 50 degrees in the G300. The same does not happen. We reached 70 degrees doing an acceleration test in 400 m. If I do not solve the saturation problem, I will put 3schul back on.
[2025-07-25T12:26:12] Dualtron Achilleus: Low margin
[2025-07-25T12:34:02] Yamal: I really want to try 3Shull in the future
[2025-07-25T12:35:02] Yamal: Also ubox with diferent mosfet like you
[2025-07-25T12:35:21] Yamal: Man you try 200a batt and 400 phase like 3shul
[2025-07-25T12:35:25] Yamal: Jus do it
[2025-07-25T12:38:40] Yamal: Or 230
[2025-07-25T12:50:41] Face de Pin Sucé: Low margins on one side, but that's okay, it's more about the professional relationship
[2025-07-25T12:53:19] JPPL: 100v 1200a peak from makerx soon

[2025-07-25T15:54:19] KierreKikkeli: Yeah i guess the ubox is a paperweight now, no matter how i try i cant get it to connect to the pc to see any specific error codes -.-. Edit, seems like the "low voltage sources" broke.. My fan header is giving 220 volts XD
[2025-07-25T18:14:36] JPPL: Short Steam have some advantages 😃

[2025-07-25T19:26:10] Matthew: What would be the next winding after 17x4? Like 13x5 or 11x5? Something like that??

[2025-07-25T22:33:39] skrtt: How much? And is the seller trustable?
[2025-07-25T22:33:51] Dualtron Achilleus: 80€ for 4
[2025-07-25T22:33:55] skrtt: Hmmm

[2025-07-25T22:34:09] Dualtron Achilleus: I will tell you next week
[2025-07-25T22:34:33] skrtt: Maybe i buy them to use thunder arm with victor motors
[2025-07-25T22:34:42] skrtt: Where is he located?
[2025-07-25T22:34:45] skrtt: Eu?
[2025-07-25T22:35:27] Dualtron Achilleus: Idk but he post a lot on pev group on facebook
[2025-07-25T22:35:30] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah eu
[2025-07-25T22:35:40] Dualtron Achilleus: The issu v’with victor
[2025-07-25T22:35:43] Dualtron Achilleus: Is that
[2025-07-25T22:35:51] Dualtron Achilleus: For the brake support
[2025-07-25T22:36:00] Dualtron Achilleus: So badly made
[2025-07-25T22:36:05] Dualtron Achilleus: Unlike thunder arms
[2025-07-25T22:47:00] skrtt: Why
[2025-07-25T22:47:09] skrtt: I dont have any problems with mine
[2025-07-25T22:47:44] Dualtron Achilleus: Hard to explain need to show diffence

[2025-07-26T02:06:13] haku: good man. still not 100% but almost there
[2025-07-26T02:07:34] haku: doing cad shit designing holders for dual 12fet to fit in triangle.
[2025-07-26T02:07:59] haku: not alot of space
[2025-07-26T02:09:11] haku: <photos/photo_24928@26-07-2025_02-09-11.jpg>
[2025-07-26T02:09:29] haku: mindfuck design
[2025-07-26T02:18:10] Noname: Why dual 12f
[2025-07-26T02:18:26] Noname: Cooling issues and doesnt even sand the paint off how dare you
[2025-07-26T02:19:05] haku: no i will put fins on it
[2025-07-26T02:19:25] haku: for peak g30v3
[2025-07-26T02:20:18] haku: 21x3 motors need 12fets i think
[2025-07-26T02:20:39] Unknown: 22x3 dont need 12fet
[2025-07-26T02:20:41] Unknown: only 33x2
[2025-07-26T02:20:58] haku: its 60h
[2025-07-26T02:21:15] haku: 12fet rear 6fet front maybe
[2025-07-26T02:22:04] Unknown: idk if the size will do any difference
[2025-07-26T02:22:24] Matthew: Man, them 85250 are frickin giants compared to 85150
[2025-07-26T02:22:57] haku: @jamessoderstrom what do you think is best option for 60h 21x3 12 fet or 6fets?
[2025-07-26T02:23:08] Matthew: I never looked at the size and just ordered it. Fits in the yume fine
[2025-07-26T02:24:25] Matthew: 100/100 got pretty hot on me running 16s 90amps battery 110phase and i am liquid cooled
[2025-07-26T02:24:46] haku: oh dang need more
[2025-07-26T02:26:11] Matthew: Fets were 54°c when I rolled into my "shop" and I screenshot this asap to try and see how long for it to cool off. 1 minute
[2025-07-26T02:26:20] Matthew: <photos/photo_24891@24-07-2025_00-55-54.jpg>
[2025-07-26T02:26:51] Matthew: 1 minute 54°c to 39°c. 100/100
[2025-07-26T02:27:09] haku: yea. need the 85/150
[2025-07-26T02:27:16] haku: also single motor yea
[2025-07-26T02:27:32] Noname: Compared to a stock vsett cube its better as its flat. Better than Nucular because they have fets on the side
[2025-07-26T02:28:11] Noname: Yeah the 100/100 is prob good for a stock ninebot
[2025-07-26T02:28:19] Matthew: Yes single motor for me. 100/100 you need more voltage.
[2025-07-26T02:28:39] Matthew: 85150 ubox are rippers imo especially for the size.
[2025-07-26T02:30:23] haku: see this is how i picture the design. i know im not the best artist nor engineer but engineer non the less.
[2025-07-26T02:30:36] haku: side by side 12 fets
[2025-07-26T02:32:28] Matthew: It pushes the 17x4 really well. It just needs more voltage and 80-100 battery will move quite nice... nothing like an 85150 or larger would push but its the size of a disposable nicotine vape pushing decent power. I was wondering if there's alternative fets to install to run a bit more amps or to run same setup, just cooler
[2025-07-26T02:33:12] haku: no enchanted fets man. just get the next step up
[2025-07-26T02:33:52] haku: idk my opinion on enchanted fets but 12 fet will be a 12 fet no matter what
[2025-07-26T02:34:02] Matthew: How many fet is 85150?
[2025-07-26T02:34:08] haku: 6
[2025-07-26T02:34:37] Matthew: Oh. And 100/100 same 6 fet?
[2025-07-26T02:34:52] haku: not sure.
[2025-07-26T02:34:58] haku: i think yes
[2025-07-26T02:35:13] Noname: Its an amazing size though
[2025-07-26T02:35:28] Noname: Could use it on an rc car easily
[2025-07-26T02:35:36] haku: yea i would get it for my boys next build
[2025-07-26T02:35:44] Noname: You want mine
[2025-07-26T02:35:50] haku: 85/150 overkill
[2025-07-26T02:35:52] Noname: Discounted
[2025-07-26T02:35:58] haku: ooh easy now
[2025-07-26T02:36:10] haku: im out of pedicure money
[2025-07-26T02:36:35] Matthew: I know dual 85150 with vsett 10 motors i ran 115amps battery and 160amps phase. The motors barely even got warm and they both had statorade in them. 110°f+ in Phoenix and controllers were fine. Id imagine cruising 85250 the controllers will stay cool
[2025-07-26T02:37:06] haku: 85/250 is very very good vesc
[2025-07-26T02:37:25] haku: noname and yams can pull 16kw per motor
[2025-07-26T02:37:34] haku: on 20s
[2025-07-26T02:38:09] Noname: Mine has no problem with 230battery 300 phase
[2025-07-26T02:38:29] haku: on 6fets?
[2025-07-26T02:38:33] haku: wait what
[2025-07-26T02:38:38] Noname: 85/250
[2025-07-26T02:38:43] haku: oh ok
[2025-07-26T02:39:09] haku: mine i had no problems on stock mosfets. the hy one was a mystery
[2025-07-26T02:39:29] haku: never lock motors on burnouts. lesson learned
[2025-07-26T02:40:35] Matthew: I was ripping max of 10.3kw with a single vsett motor and 85150 lol
[2025-07-26T02:41:19] Noname: My 100/100 r u confused
[2025-07-26T02:41:52] Matthew: Single vsett motor? 😮
[2025-07-26T02:41:56] haku: i know. i have 85/150 on sons old peak g30. i will downgrade him.
[2025-07-26T02:42:12] Noname: 10" emoped
[2025-07-26T02:42:15] haku: he wont need all that power yet
[2025-07-26T02:42:25] Matthew: I am blown away on what them guys are pulling out of their wild setups
[2025-07-26T02:42:43] haku: i cant tune shit
[2025-07-26T02:42:43] Noname: Its all about batterys
[2025-07-26T02:43:12] Noname: Batterys = money. Money = fun. No money = no fun 😕
[2025-07-26T02:43:41] haku: its sad the most expensive part of the build is battery
[2025-07-26T02:43:59] haku: and once its welded its hard to put on another vehicle
[2025-07-26T02:44:28] Noname: Na just cut the seat tub.lol
[2025-07-26T02:44:41] Noname: I gotta start the vsett battery ugh
[2025-07-26T02:44:49] Noname: Mabey sell that thing
[2025-07-26T02:44:53] haku: ripping off copper is difficult dude
[2025-07-26T02:45:28] haku: i thought about repurpousing the 40t pack
[2025-07-26T02:45:30] Noname: Need that chisel guillotine
[2025-07-26T02:45:51] haku: yea. may he rest in peace. i wish had files for it
[2025-07-26T02:46:48] Matthew: Its got me in the feels... I think I will have a job offer monday... fingers and toes crossed
[2025-07-26T02:47:10] haku: you gots this dude!
[2025-07-26T02:47:24] haku: your resume speaks more
[2025-07-26T02:47:44] Noname: Ah you'll still be broke. Pev is an addiction lol
[2025-07-26T02:48:07] haku: yea this hobby is crazy expensive
[2025-07-26T02:48:16] haku: i should just go back to bjj
[2025-07-26T02:48:34] haku: might aswell get my black belt
[2025-07-26T02:48:35] Noname: I was looking at cheap motorcycle 👀
[2025-07-26T02:48:59] Matthew: Im ok with that. I was gifted $100 from my father... and i have a jar of coins
[2025-07-26T02:49:20] Matthew: As long as money is coming in I can save for stuff
[2025-07-26T02:49:35] haku: god will always provide my boys
[2025-07-26T02:49:59] haku: look at me proffessional bum

[2025-07-26T02:53:55] Matthew: Me too lol. I know how this goes. I used to build cars. I can't afford them shits these days. But throwing $600 for ecu, $1k for an exhaust header. $80 for 4 sparkplugs. 20k mile synthetic oil. Built motor goes boom. I lost $30k trading in my Lexus sc300. I ate $7k when my Honda motor went boom. Transmissions I didn't like. Ect
[2025-07-26T02:54:24] Noname: Yeah I dont fuck with cars lol
[2025-07-26T02:54:57] Noname: Not that electric doesnt suck up cash

[2025-07-26T02:57:36] haku: true
[2025-07-26T02:57:45] Noname: There was some shit in CT about ebike laws

[2025-07-26T03:04:28] Matthew: Guys at work would ask me how much to charge. Said like 10 cents per day. Said it costs more to run a load of laundry than it does for me to charge for a full weeks commute lol
[2025-07-26T03:04:33] Noname: Gay
[2025-07-26T03:04:59] Noname: Idk what a kw is here forgot to look

[2025-07-26T03:07:08] Noname: Idk im not looking at.my bill rt now
[2025-07-26T03:10:20] Matthew: I bought in the recession. I had a solid booming job where I was getting to travel. I bought a 3 car garage 1720sqft 3bdrm + a den which i made into a rec room for playing drums and working out. Value to rebuild was $480k. I bought the home for $85k. 15yr mortgage and I was at 8yr left to pay in full within 3.5yrs owning the home. I was a hustler back then, 20yr old energy. Id work on cars on the side too. Id get home do what I need to do. Go start wrenching on the cars and be underneath them, fall asleep, wake back up and continue wrenching away even though I needed to be up for work in a couple of hours
[2025-07-26T03:11:57] haku: remember my dude. life is a wheel. up and down and back up
[2025-07-26T03:12:22] Noname: 20 more years and this shed is mine
[2025-07-26T03:12:27] haku: atleast boys didnt marry
[2025-07-26T03:12:37] Noname: Fuck no
[2025-07-26T03:12:46] Matthew: Yeah, the house sold 3rd day on the market lol. Cash buyer
[2025-07-26T03:12:50] Noname: Im dumb not stupid
[2025-07-26T03:12:51] haku: shit made me ugly and grow white hairs. inwas such a beautiful lad
[2025-07-26T03:13:11] haku: but still handsome non the less
[2025-07-26T03:13:21] Noname: I hate people with 500k cash 😆
[2025-07-26T03:13:52] Matthew: I was trying to get a nice used 5th wheel rv because fuck apartment living and homes cost way too much rn
[2025-07-26T03:14:43] Noname: Its just parking problems honestly. I like my house but im a.slave to it
[2025-07-26T03:16:40] Noname: Ok quit bothering me I need to map out a ride for tmrw
[2025-07-26T03:16:58] Noname: Mabey a quick nap first
[2025-07-26T03:17:36] Matthew: Still can't beat it. I just budget while living in Phoenix for Uber was like $200 per month. It cost me $700 per month just to own a car in Phoenix at one point.. gas and maintenance was above that $700 per month to use it.
[2025-07-26T03:18:28] Noname: I dont commute on it
[2025-07-26T03:19:19] Noname: Just vs a gas bike i dont care about 2$ or 10$ per weekend in gas. If I meet up with friends 40mi away its 20$ in my truck I've started just riding the 40mi there
[2025-07-26T03:20:35] Matthew: My ex asked about marriage. I said I dont believe in marriage unless it gives us free money lol. He felt the same
[2025-07-26T03:25:28] Matthew: Lol. Most money ive had in my hand was ~$35k. Thats what I pocket from the sale. I basically just go what I put into the house. The new owners basically had a brand new home. I had also just installed a standalone maintenance free water system to where company just rolls up every 6 months and makes sure everything was still good. Only thing necessary was that softener salt. Before that was a nightmare to keep up the well system. New ac, new appliances, new waterheater, you get the picture.
[2025-07-26T03:27:10] Noname: Gimme more phase amps I dont care about stability need tire smoke
[2025-07-26T03:27:29] Noname: I want to be like those Indonesian homies
[2025-07-26T03:29:55] Noname: Can almost smoke my buddy's ninja 250
[2025-07-26T03:30:18] Matthew: Thats what made me sell my home. I ended up going back to an aerospace company i worked before and they wanted me back so I took the job. That made my work commute go from 45 miles per day to 100 miles per day commute. I did that for a few years straight and then I had enough of it.
[2025-07-26T03:31:18] Noname: I kinda envy people who work remote. Id so travel and ride possibly visit Haku and kick his ass for no reason
[2025-07-26T03:32:28] haku: lmao wear fishnet stockings when you do
[2025-07-26T03:32:41] Noname: Mine tore
[2025-07-26T03:32:46] Noname: Need new ones
[2025-07-26T03:36:15] Matthew: I have a "recent" past bullshit in life im trying to recover from. 2019 til about 3-4 years ago was absolutely fucked for me. I spent that 2019 til 2021 I spent the time trying to kill myself. I dont remember much of 2020 at all. Lots of legal trouble so I don't have a driver's license and been trying to survive since so haven't been able to pay all them legal fees to get my driver's license back. I have a car now, '98 monte carlo. Past 5ish years have been pretty interesting for me to say the least.
[2025-07-26T03:37:32] haku: yea man. i stay out of trouble nowadays. but it just finds me for some reason
[2025-07-26T03:37:56] Matthew: Talking of remote. My brother just got a fully remote job but has to have an Arizona address. He got an apartment 20 miles in the border and moved today lol. So hes only 2 hours from me
[2025-07-26T03:38:07] Noname: Yeah I have a friend who rides to work even in winter because of warrants and driver bs
[2025-07-26T03:38:25] haku: dui? 4 strikes?
[2025-07-26T03:38:28] Noname: Hes late 50's I dont want to be like that
[2025-07-26T03:39:07] haku: alot of las vegas folk have that 3 strike dui shit
[2025-07-26T03:39:14] Noname: Crashed a company car couldn't pay bills went to warrants or whatever
[2025-07-26T03:39:30] Noname: Was texting and driving

[2025-07-26T03:42:25] Matthew: Same man! I DO NOT GO OUT ON HOLIDAYS. I am cursed. Any time ive decided let's go out for this holiday I get in trouble.
[2025-07-26T03:42:49] Noname: Ok ill erase that from our date night activity list
[2025-07-26T03:43:17] haku: look up thunder from down under. trully the best vegas show
[2025-07-26T03:44:02] Noname: Don't get me wrong driving drunk is fun af but so bad. Need a closed course where you pretend to get chased by cops
[2025-07-26T03:44:25] haku: that i never do because i dont drink
[2025-07-26T03:44:38] haku: once i had weed. i had to uber home

[2025-07-26T03:45:14] Noname: Ever since trying gas station weed shit
[2025-07-26T03:45:24] Noname: Like 15yrs ago

[2025-07-26T03:46:18] haku: thats not real weed is it? synthetic?
[2025-07-26T03:46:26] Noname: Synth
[2025-07-26T03:46:48] Noname: It was fucking horrible I felt like such a piece of shit
[2025-07-26T03:47:10] Noname: That was my last day
[2025-07-26T03:47:20] haku: yea i cant weed man. i get too paranoid. im already paranoid enough
[2025-07-26T03:47:30] Noname: Ya dont say
[2025-07-26T03:48:14] haku: i am self diagnosed autistic though. i know it for a fact
[2025-07-26T03:48:59] Matthew: Mine was me being bipolar and lost will to live when my grandmother passed. Id wake up in hospitals. Id wake up handcuffed. Id wake up on the floor face all fucked up from od and falling over. I dont even know how many times I od and still woke up. The one im really paying for is I went to a liquor store, bought 40 99apple shooters. I parked and put some music i liked on. It was cold outside so the car was running also so battery didnt die. I cracked open them packs of 10. Swallowed a bunch of pills and kept drinking. Yeah, I wasnt supposed to wake up. Police wake me up. Well car is running so theres my dui
[2025-07-26T03:49:50] haku: i like to instigate shit. like i was talking to cops the other day. i was instigating shit haha
[2025-07-26T03:50:20] Noname: I was at a hooters in Missouri some dude was like oh from out of town Wana smoke. Well I was already drinking and he has some Cali weed unfortunately it was strong af. I had to walk to the holtel down the side of a highway as I didnt have a car for a day. Walked by reception like I was hiding from my parents and somehow landed in the bed. Its shit like that, that made me rethink what I was doing
[2025-07-26T03:50:25] haku: im like sure ban the surrons. but look at me law abiding
[2025-07-26T03:51:26] haku: small bike cant go fast mr. officer. look at the lights. law abiding
[2025-07-26T03:51:27] Noname: We all go through tough times
[2025-07-26T03:51:34] Matthew: I didnt drink and drive and if I was having a drink it was 2 beers and chill out drink water eat some snacks and 2 hrs later leave. My dui was from being parked and falling asleep
[2025-07-26T03:52:01] haku: dang.

[2025-07-26T03:56:06] haku: we have rodeo championships too
[2025-07-26T03:56:10] Noname: There's bands in the common sometimes
[2025-07-26T03:56:14] haku: depends on the time of the year
[2025-07-26T03:56:58] haku: you can also go in a 5 star spa. if you want to see euro cock. they go balls out
[2025-07-26T03:58:20] haku: but as a local its tiring. not even want to go even if its free
[2025-07-26T03:59:48] Matthew: You dont even need to be over the limit. Phoenix is zero tolerance. The laws for the dui was i was in access to the keys to operate the vehicle and vehicle is running with key in ignition. They knew what I was doing. Someone called them saying I think that guy is dead. I got to wrestle with 2 weak officers, that was funny. I had my 12ga shotgun with me too...
[2025-07-26T04:00:23] Noname: Been to phoenix and no thank you
[2025-07-26T04:00:54] Matthew: Scorpions in Phoenix lol
[2025-07-26T04:08:38] Matthew: Phoenix was nice when I moved there in 2015.... 2020 happened and that place is nothing like it was. All the people escaping California changed Phoenix bad
[2025-07-26T04:10:56] Noname: Idk it was -10 here and 100f there I was dying and it was the hood. And my friends neighbors killed a small party we were having by inviting themselves till Everyone left
[2025-07-26T04:11:43] Noname: So 2 fights couldn't breathe and boring ass development
[2025-07-26T04:11:50] Noname: Did I mention it was hot af
[2025-07-26T04:12:41] Matthew: I won't blame it all on cali though.... People after the pandemic just got so used to being on the internet talking shit until they meet people like me or you guys will straight turn their heads sideways. People become so shitty vaguely speaking after the pandemic lockdowns
[2025-07-26T04:13:44] Matthew: That blows! There's so many bad areas out in Phoenix. My pistol was always on me. People so sketchy out there.
[2025-07-26T04:15:16] Matthew: The heat is something else. My mother and brother are dying at 90°f and I am like its quite nice out here. I lived in south Florida for 10yrs, the Arizona heat was nothing compared to humid climate where sweat doesn't do the job intended
[2025-07-26T04:16:10] Noname: Well jump on a plane and instantly gain 100 degrees and your body is like wft is this shit
[2025-07-26T04:16:42] Noname: Legit went from snowstorm to baking in an oven
[2025-07-26T04:17:28] Noname: I couldn't breathe my cigaretts lit up like firecrackers and any less clothes I'd be on a list
[2025-07-26T04:21:05] Matthew: Yeah man, thats drastic lol! When I was in casper, wy 2005 winter into 2006 we had a solid week of -45° with the windchill factor and Daytona was 90°f..... when I moved to Florida, I about moved out because the 1st year there was brutal
[2025-07-26T04:22:27] Matthew: <photos/photo_24932@26-07-2025_04-22-27.jpg>
[2025-07-26T04:23:00] Noname: Yeah wy etc is no joke cold. Fuck welding for a living id die
[2025-07-26T04:23:19] Noname: 40 to 75 is my zone
[2025-07-26T04:24:25] Matthew: I have been spoiled with aerospace and semiconductor having good climate controlled facilities because of parameters for welding and also for machine shop cnc to keep proper consistent dimensions
[2025-07-26T04:25:41] Noname: This fucking reservoir is fucking up my route lol
[2025-07-26T04:26:03] Matthew: But I aint afraid to roll around and get dirty and weld heavy hot stuff... just if I can be picky I am. Like rn I am waiting for white sands missile range to run through everything they need to know about me. In past similar jobs they have to get your full in depth background before you can even interview.
[2025-07-26T04:26:25] Noname: My gold bond reserve is getting used well this nonth
[2025-07-26T04:27:44] Matthew: We had to use these flame throwing torches to preheat our metal and I made my own flame warmed radiator like half a foot from me lol. You'll never see so many welders excited to get to work ASAP until winter lol
[2025-07-26T04:28:57] Noname: Yeah when you keep your water bottle in your jacket because you can't drink ice. Been there
[2025-07-26T04:30:35] Matthew: It aint fun
[2025-07-26T04:35:57] haku: bigger light lets see.
[2025-07-26T04:36:44] haku: peak g30 never stops upgrading
[2025-07-26T04:37:39] Matthew: Noway, 11ish pm
[2025-07-26T04:38:39] Matthew: <photos/photo_24936@26-07-2025_04-38-39.jpg>
[2025-07-26T04:39:31] Matthew: @Bradhaku
[2025-07-26T04:40:04] Matthew: <photos/photo_24938@26-07-2025_04-40-04.jpg>
[2025-07-26T04:41:28] Matthew: <photos/photo_24939@26-07-2025_04-41-28.jpg>
[2025-07-26T04:44:42] Matthew: @Bradhaku Noname 572"bbc ~720rwhp through a modified turbo 400 trans. I haven't messaged him in a while. Kid that grew up while I worked for the Norwegians his family owns the business. He said trans is good for 1500whp and had a nitrous setup he wants to use
[2025-07-26T04:46:42] Matthew: <photos/photo_24941@26-07-2025_04-46-42.jpg>
[2025-07-26T04:47:45] haku: corvette?
[2025-07-26T05:10:57] Matthew: Yes
[2025-07-26T05:14:10] Matthew: He actually did all the work. He did body work and painted it and did all the mechanic work, obviously he has money to get whatever he wants. All the owners sons are share holders and certain family members have more invested. The 2 oldest actually drilled and machined parts with his father. So they kinda worked more for their share in the business. The father is a billionaire, I dont know how wealthy the kids are now. He said they'd re hire me to work in norway.... I would retire there... not work
[2025-07-26T05:14:16] Noname: Ok I think 230mi should be doable in 10 to 12 hrs. Limited by only 40a charging 😒
[2025-07-26T05:15:23] Matthew: Strap a generator to a side car lol
[2025-07-26T05:15:30] Noname: I know
[2025-07-26T05:15:39] Noname: Believe me I've thought of it

[2025-07-26T06:21:16] Noname: Paint looks good though. Id paint it perfectly then drop it in the dirt lol
[2025-07-26T06:43:15] haku: 12" make it fit Noname is it possible?
[2025-07-26T06:43:29] haku: lol

[2025-07-26T06:43:47] haku: so many bad choices in buying parts. dam
[2025-07-26T06:44:08] haku: mini bike frame prolly will be the best for 12"

[2025-07-26T07:00:20] Yamal: New record /// today off tracción control
[2025-07-26T07:11:43] Yamal: These days I'm experiencing new sensations, by far this is the fastest I've ever been on an e-scooter.
[2025-07-26T07:14:12] Noname: Ah so close 88mph

[2025-07-26T07:43:00] haku: nipples get hard. need to focus
[2025-07-26T07:43:33] Yamal: I'm more than satisfied. I can't ask for more for the 20s. These speeds can't be achieved in everyday life, unless you take a detour on your way to work.
[2025-07-26T07:44:00] haku: agreed. dude do it in a controlled emvironment yams
[2025-07-26T07:44:14] skrtt: We want to see that detour from monday to friday

[2025-07-26T07:45:22] Yamal: Likewise, programming is Swedish! And therefore, the closer you are to the source, the closer you are to perfection :)
[2025-07-26T07:45:23] skrtt: Us shipping 👌
[2025-07-26T07:45:29] haku: still need need to post it on marketplace. but i doubt no one will buy

[2025-07-26T07:52:57] haku: he can graduate vesc university with honors
[2025-07-26T07:52:58] skrtt: He will reach 200kmh when he switches to 22s 😆
[2025-07-26T07:53:47] skrtt: @jamaludin_algarnati u have stock nami stem
[2025-07-26T07:53:51] skrtt: De aluminium one

[2025-07-26T08:05:28] Yamal: Stock one is carbon fiber
[2025-07-26T08:06:13] Yamal: and I cut it several times, so it is in bad condition. In the afternoon I will try to send some photos
[2025-07-26T08:32:37] skrtt: So u make aluminium one?
[2025-07-26T08:33:16] Yamal: Is from Ambrosini
[2025-07-26T08:33:42] Yamal: Anatoly stem

[2025-07-26T08:36:45] Yamal: XD
[2025-07-26T08:38:20] Yamal: Just kidding, we once compared it to the Rage Titanium, and it was quite a bit heavier, but it works great for me, perfect fit and quite solid since it's solid.
[2025-07-26T09:04:25] haku: Noname https://youtube.com/shorts/WPt60MNPjVQ?si=nsEN44Gwdj29CRV4

[2025-07-26T11:24:09] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: How is it possible that magnets bend?
[2025-07-26T11:27:48] Face de Pin Sucé: Many end up like this x)

[2025-07-26T11:57:57] Dualtron Achilleus: Its @shlomda2 he posted here also
[2025-07-26T12:58:47] AG.racing: Hi everyone, I have Flipsky 75100 Pro v2.0 and 75200 Prov2.0 on the back. 2-pin basic brake sensor connected to 3.3V and ADC2 for the kill switch, which option should I choose? Adc2 low or adc2 high ?
[2025-07-26T13:03:27] Noname: I think it was because 2 piece magnets. One side pulled more
[2025-07-26T13:18:24] skrtt: Paolo answerd saying that it was a combination of factor. Too much heat, too much amps
[2025-07-26T13:34:06] Yamal: But this is not magnet
[2025-07-26T13:34:12] Yamal: Just stator ?
[2025-07-26T13:49:08] skrtt: I think magnet is oke
[2025-07-26T13:49:37] skrtt: He told he is going to try to swap just the inside
[2025-07-26T14:17:27] Dualtron Achilleus: Is this safe to put dualtron front and back light on 12v 3A port of spinted?
[2025-07-26T14:17:51] Dualtron Achilleus: How much comsuptio is one led
[2025-07-26T14:18:22] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I wouldn't do it
[2025-07-26T14:19:16] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: At school I only had the rear brake light, I had no problems, but I wouldn't risk the spotlight and the light.
[2025-07-26T14:25:22] Dualtron Achilleus: Okay
[2025-07-26T14:44:10] Mike Schwab🇨🇭: This is the stator, the magnets are in the rim. These are lamination stacks with a thin layer of varnish in between each layer. Done to minimize eddy currents.

[2025-07-26T20:12:40] Yamal: But for now I don't find any temperature problems or anything, let's hope everything stays well, but it's clear that after the events and the things that have been said, I wouldn't choose them again, although now 80h is single magnet right?
[2025-07-26T20:15:09] Yamal: I have to say the torque on the 80h is fun, I can't even imagine. 400/450 A on them!
[2025-07-26T20:15:32] Yamal: I could say that you've also had some bad luck.
[2025-07-26T20:16:15] IMWurden: guys, which Is the max battery amps and maximum motore current, the makerbase 75200 pro can support at 20s
[2025-07-26T20:16:32] skrtt: 65km done and still at 56v (~40%) 35ah at 60v is wonderfull
[2025-07-26T20:16:44] Yamal: We use e-scooter on the street, their requirements are not high.
[2025-07-26T20:18:09] Yamal: I've heard that the Swiss have been running the 80h for a year without any problems on the circuit, but it wasn't until now that he encountered this problem
[2025-07-26T20:19:04] Yamal: If I had 400A or 450A of phase, believe me, I would have it, but that's not the case!
[2025-07-26T20:20:18] Yamal: Let's see if after the summer I can start going to the track and start frying eggs on the engine covers ^^
[2025-07-26T20:22:46] haku: this vermont?
[2025-07-26T20:23:51] skrtt: I need the opinions of the 22s moli people
[2025-07-26T20:24:31] skrtt: How much range do u guys get at 60kmh+
[2025-07-26T20:25:01] skrtt: @jamaludin_algarnati how is your range? At good speed
[2025-07-26T20:29:11] Noname: Mt Greylock North Adams MA
[2025-07-26T20:29:23] Yamal: 45/50kmh =80/100 km
[2025-07-26T20:29:37] Noname: I stepped on the Appalachia trail just for you
[2025-07-26T20:29:46] skrtt: U have 40ah?
[2025-07-26T20:29:48] IMWurden: guys, which Is the max battery amps and maximum motore current, the makerbase 75200 pro can support at 20s

[2025-07-26T20:30:02] Yamal: Yes
[2025-07-26T20:30:56] skrtt: So at 22s with 45ah i can expect 120km going 50kmh and prob 65km going 80kmh?
[2025-07-26T20:35:03] haku: what you been up to big dawg!
[2025-07-26T20:42:38] puneDir: I finally graduated from high school And i passed the turkish university exam Now im moving to istanbul for electric electronics engineering collage

[2025-07-26T20:47:19] Yamal: Ok now understand
[2025-07-26T20:47:29] Yamal: Maybe more than 120
[2025-07-26T20:48:30] puneDir: Thank you brother
[2025-07-26T20:48:31] Yamal: but I think 50/55kmh is a good average to do many kilometers and not fall asleep,
[2025-07-26T20:50:07] Yamal: The truth is that it must be amazing to have a 22s MoliCel battery, because imagine an Eve 22s 10p or 11p, you have infinite margin to play
[2025-07-26T21:03:54] skrtt: Maybe i will go with 11p
[2025-07-26T21:04:06] skrtt: Cant go wrong with more Ah and A
[2025-07-26T21:04:21] skrtt: But need to buy 22 more cells

[2025-07-26T21:10:40] Yamal: If you can just do it !
[2025-07-26T21:10:55] Yamal: Better 11 than 10
[2025-07-26T21:40:07] haku: isnt p45 very cheap in spain/portugal. so much supply?

[2025-07-28T00:09:26] haku: you can adjust for speed or torque
[2025-07-28T00:09:27] Dualtron Achilleus: More torque than hub
[2025-07-28T00:10:05] skrtt: Can u change both?
[2025-07-28T00:10:37] skrtt: I dont know the name in english but the little thing with teeth

[2025-07-28T00:10:48] haku: idk man. this fiido modding culture is a whole different rabbit hole
[2025-07-28T00:11:07] skrtt: Im talking abour the motor
[2025-07-28T00:11:57] skrtt: Its possible to change the thing where the chain connects to the motor
[2025-07-28T00:12:05] skrtt: To bigger or smaller

[2025-07-28T00:37:43] Dualtron Achilleus: i dont even put current in it
[2025-07-28T00:38:11] Dualtron Achilleus: guess its uselless
[2025-07-28T00:38:44] haku: what winding?
[2025-07-28T00:38:44] Dualtron Achilleus: 60h with large stator outmatch everything here
[2025-07-28T00:38:56] Dualtron Achilleus: like 10 inch motor 60h crazy
[2025-07-28T00:39:11] Dualtron Achilleus: idk its minimotor stock engin

[2025-07-28T00:39:31] haku: i see. isnt minimotor huameng?
[2025-07-28T00:39:38] Dualtron Achilleus: around 30kv guess
[2025-07-28T00:40:00] Dualtron Achilleus: huameng?
[2025-07-28T00:40:14] haku: huameng motors. rebranded
[2025-07-28T00:40:48] haku: is that right @PaoloWu @jamessoderstrom minimotors is rebranded huameng?
[2025-07-28T00:41:04] Dualtron Achilleus: idk this motor brand
[2025-07-28T00:42:00] Dualtron Achilleus: axial motor are the best
[2025-07-28T00:42:57] Dualtron Achilleus: 13 kg motor can peak at 124kw
[2025-07-28T00:43:04] Dualtron Achilleus: 75 kw rated
[2025-07-28T00:43:24] Dualtron Achilleus: only issue is that it cost like 4k€

[2025-07-28T01:14:34] Rose: Hey there Mr, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-07-28T01:14:52] skrtt: Stock. But they identified themselfs with vesc
[2025-07-28T01:15:26] skrtt: I know i have "eabs" from minimotors but i dont like it
[2025-07-28T01:19:55] luffydnoob: What do you mean by identified themselves with vesc ? 😅
[2025-07-28T01:28:02] skrtt: They are gay
[2025-07-28T01:51:38] NetworkDir: Electronic ABS (dualtron shitty tak tak tak shorting phase method) :D
[2025-07-28T02:46:49] haku: dam they confiscated them all. idk know what to say about this. freedom has limits. just saying. https://youtu.be/eJyiJuGFuKk?si=OURXzgeR8oR13_E-
[2025-07-28T02:47:35] haku: vegas about to look like this very very soon 😭
[2025-07-28T02:51:12] haku: very impressed with that asian dude speaking fluent spanish @28min mark
[2025-07-28T04:00:54] skrtt: @jamaludin_algarnati u change the strength of the damper mid ride? Crazy skills
[2025-07-28T05:33:01] Yamal: just easy man ,,, you try
[2025-07-28T06:12:53] skrtt: I dont trust me nor the roads
[2025-07-28T06:48:20] Yamal: Good morning group, I'm going to be away for a few weeks. Those who have been in the group for a while know that from time to time I make a "smoke bomb" and disappear. xD, be happy
[2025-07-28T07:05:12] haku: okay yams. atleast you warned me this time. last time i went all out. i called the interpol

[2025-07-28T07:33:58] skrtt: Enjoy and get some rest
[2025-07-28T10:17:19] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah minimotor 11 inch are 60h
[2025-07-28T10:25:13] beh.....bz.....: Have you guys somthing that can handle over 150A or over 4KW ? 10 inch would be optimal! And dropout most be maximal 130 !
[2025-07-28T10:25:52] Dualtron Achilleus: Th3 is 65h
[2025-07-28T11:29:42] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Remind me what u have on it ?
[2025-07-28T11:37:25] Marius: 65h?
[2025-07-28T13:03:52] luffydnoob: And victor 50h ?
[2025-07-28T13:05:33] Dualtron Achilleus: Idk
[2025-07-28T13:34:22] Dualtron Achilleus: I was thinking, does someone already build or buy a converter, like you have 16s batterie and you want 100v
[2025-07-28T13:35:07] JPPL: Enjoy your time brother, we all need it! See you soon dont vanish 😜
[2025-07-28T15:40:27] ✨🇪🇸عمر: so it's TMW's machine, it's very reduced, because it has a battery not warned of base for the nami, but it has 2 75h in speed, 2 r350, but it only has 240 A of discharge in total...
[2025-07-28T15:57:43] IMWurden: guys i need to request to lonnyomotor a custom motore for High torque, i don't know how It works, so i want to ask you guys what can i request (the specs the motor needs to be as a high torque motore). the distance between the forks of the scooter Is the same of the forks of the Blade gt
[2025-07-28T16:07:42] IMWurden: my config Is 300A phase and 100/150A battery current, the battery Is 20s
[2025-07-28T16:31:12] Dualtron Achilleus: If your max is 300A take more a torque widing 22*3
[2025-07-28T16:31:41] Dualtron Achilleus: But also have to know what max speed you want
[2025-07-28T16:31:48] Dualtron Achilleus: And if dual or single build
[2025-07-28T16:54:00] IMWurden: im in a dual motor build, now with the stock Blade gt motor (the One i want to change) and a motor from paolowu, i can hit about 115kmh
[2025-07-28T16:54:08] IMWurden: what 22*3 mean?
[2025-07-28T16:54:39] IMWurden: the max Speed maybe about 110-120kmh
[2025-07-28T16:57:29] Rose: Hey there Raphael Winkler, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-07-28T17:14:25] Dualtron Achilleus: Widing of motor ,
[2025-07-28T17:15:22] Dualtron Achilleus: 22*3 have approximalty same torque at 200/250phase than a 33*2 at 350 400phase
[2025-07-28T17:15:31] Dualtron Achilleus: But 33*2 is faster
[2025-07-28T17:24:56] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is faster or gets more speed
[2025-07-28T17:26:03] Dualtron Achilleus: Faster but less torque if same amps as 22*3
[2025-07-28T17:34:35] francois schempers: we are in south Africa, that's my sister, I couldn't do it because I'm too heavy for it ^^'
[2025-07-28T17:34:44] francois schempers: <video_file>
[2025-07-28T17:36:13] IMWurden: oh ok, so which type of motor do i Need to request? like the Number of pole, stator dimensioni, type of magnet and all those other things about i don't know much
[2025-07-28T17:38:06] IMWurden: i don't even know which specs a torque motor needs, im not an expert on those things, sorry
[2025-07-28T17:46:12] Dualtron Achilleus: First what is the space btw your two arms?
[2025-07-28T17:47:39] IMWurden: i didn't measur It but when i'll be home i Will check
[2025-07-28T17:51:10] Dualtron Achilleus: You need 155m minimun
[2025-07-28T17:51:34] Dualtron Achilleus: And lonnyo not really made custom i guess, or it will be so expensive
[2025-07-28T17:51:55] Dualtron Achilleus: But for you config just take on of there product already build for scooter
[2025-07-28T17:53:37] IMWurden: so, to Who can i request for a custom motor?
[2025-07-28T17:53:43] IMWurden: i prefer a custom one
[2025-07-28T17:59:07] Dualtron Achilleus: Why custom man? For 300phase you dont need custom
[2025-07-28T17:59:55] Dualtron Achilleus: Juste take a 80h speed and you will be happy
[2025-07-28T18:01:58] Dualtron Achilleus: I dont even know if there is custom brand for esccoter
[2025-07-28T18:11:20] skrtt: Fat shaming 😔
[2025-07-28T18:13:48] francois schempers: Well I'm 30kg above the max, I won't even try to bargain xD
[2025-07-28T18:14:12] skrtt: Whats max? 80?
[2025-07-28T18:14:54] francois schempers: 120 😂😂
[2025-07-28T18:15:34] skrtt: Big boy right here ehehehehe
[2025-07-28T18:18:20] francois schempers: I'm a big man 😂😂
[2025-07-28T18:18:24] francois schempers: <photos/photo_24989@28-07-2025_18-18-24.jpg>
[2025-07-28T18:28:07] IMWurden: what 80h mean?
[2025-07-28T18:28:58] IMWurden: which High torque motor you suggest to buy for my 72v build?
[2025-07-28T18:45:59] skrtt: Magnet size
[2025-07-28T18:46:21] skrtt: Maybe go with a 80h 22x3 as he told u before
[2025-07-28T18:47:54] skrtt: What paolo motor u have
[2025-07-28T18:49:02] IMWurden: i don't know, because the old owner of the e scooter bought It, i only knows that It has 30 pole and 70mm stator
[2025-07-28T18:49:30] IMWurden: more the magnet are big more the torque Will be? can you explain to me how It works? thanks
[2025-07-28T18:49:40] skrtt: Cant u take a photo of it?
[2025-07-28T18:49:44] IMWurden: yeah
[2025-07-28T18:49:56] skrtt: Yes bigger magnet more torque
[2025-07-28T18:49:57] IMWurden: <photos/photo_24990@28-07-2025_18-49-57.jpg>
[2025-07-28T18:50:01] IMWurden: oh oks
[2025-07-28T18:50:18] IMWurden: this one
[2025-07-28T18:50:31] skrtt: Ask paolo
[2025-07-28T18:50:38] skrtt: He might remember
[2025-07-28T18:51:06] skrtt: "Smaller" winding more torque less speed
[2025-07-28T18:51:07] Paolo ⁭: He already asked and I already answered, I don't know why he is still asking same question everywhere
[2025-07-28T18:51:27] skrtt: I asked the motor specs
[2025-07-28T18:52:22] IMWurden: i asked to him and he only said to me this
[2025-07-28T18:52:28] IMWurden: 30 poles and 70mm stator
[2025-07-28T18:53:27] skrtt: @PaoloWu whats the winding and magnet size?
[2025-07-28T18:53:53] Paolo ⁭: 22x3
[2025-07-28T18:54:10] skrtt: 60h?
[2025-07-28T18:54:46] Paolo ⁭: 70
[2025-07-28T18:55:07] skrtt: There u go
[2025-07-28T18:55:12] IMWurden: thanks
[2025-07-28T18:55:21] IMWurden: but i don't really know what all those things mean
[2025-07-28T18:55:27] skrtt: If u can fit a 75 or 80h is bettet cuz more torque
[2025-07-28T18:55:42] Paolo ⁭: But I already said to him
[2025-07-28T18:55:42] skrtt: Keep the 22x3 winding
[2025-07-28T18:55:43] IMWurden: i Just Need a good High torque motore that doesnt Blow up ad 300A phase
[2025-07-28T18:55:49] IMWurden: ok
[2025-07-28T18:55:56] Paolo ⁭: He can't fit bigger motor until he swap arms axle
[2025-07-28T18:56:28] skrtt: Not even the small 75h version?
[2025-07-28T18:56:30] skrtt: .
[2025-07-28T18:57:56] Paolo ⁭: It even fatigues to fit 60h

[2025-07-29T12:09:56] Face de Pin Sucé: Because poorly installed
[2025-07-29T12:10:55] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah shity , i am waiting these
[2025-07-29T12:19:47] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: There's something you don't understand, personal problems have nothing to do with the administrators of any group. When a member is expelled, it's for creating bad vibes or insulting, which I don't think I've ever done. I've only been informed about their poor work or personal treatment, which is unmatched. You have to take many information and personal treatment courses.
[2025-07-29T12:19:49] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Fin
[2025-07-29T12:41:09] Paolo ⁭: Don't be surprised if the controller randomly dies when you push throttle
[2025-07-29T13:07:25] 'lekrsu': Are you kidding? You nailed all those criteria!
[2025-07-29T13:17:29] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: referring to him yes but never to another person in the group
[2025-07-29T13:36:18] 'lekrsu': You brought private matters into the group so you have to expect some responses
[2025-07-29T13:40:43] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: No, you deserve to be expelled for defamation, it's illegal, I could even take you to court for that and I would win, but I wouldn't for reasons of time and cost, on the other hand you deserve to be expelled at least to let's you diffaming anyone
[2025-07-29T14:09:03] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I prefer to be pointed at for that reason😘
[2025-07-29T14:14:10] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I repeat, if you fixed the controllers because they don't work, I sent them back for repair. I already made a video at the time of the installation of all the cables. I showed the videos but the controllers don't work.
[2025-07-29T14:18:27] IMWurden: which controller are those?
[2025-07-29T14:25:03] Happy Giraffe: I had this same issue once as I accidentally clicked "pairing done". Connecting by USB to PC solved it. Maybe should have a warning of this somewhere in group as app didnt warn about it last time
[2025-07-29T14:28:52] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 3chul-4

[2025-07-30T04:35:19] Matthew: So you would recommend no higher than 20s "reliably"? So far 14s 20ah 40amps battery was enough to get me up some of the steepest hills in my area so I dont expect or want high power, I just want to get much better performance for what its potential may be? Its the 1st 100/100 ive ever used.
[2025-07-30T04:40:29] Matthew: 16s 90amps battery 110phase 30amps field weakening @ 88% has been the most smooth for me and definitely no issues with hills around me. 65h 17x4 BTW
[2025-07-30T04:42:13] Matthew: <photos/photo_25021@30-07-2025_04-42-13.jpg>

[2025-07-30T13:17:08] skrtt: Guys where can i find this piece but the newer version without the bearings
[2025-07-30T13:17:48] skrtt: Chinese seller took 2 weeks to send it and sent old version
[2025-07-30T13:31:25] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: AliExpress
[2025-07-30T13:31:40] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Sue him 🤣
[2025-07-30T13:32:18] skrtt: As i said he took to long and send the wrong version
[2025-07-30T13:34:10] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: How much is too long ?
[2025-07-30T13:35:44] skrtt: 13 days
[2025-07-30T13:35:58] skrtt: Just to send the package
[2025-07-30T13:36:52] skrtt: I also bought the steering dampet kit and he took 20 days to send it
[2025-07-30T13:38:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Fast imo
[2025-07-30T13:39:22] Dualtron Achilleus: Do you have picture of the new?
[2025-07-30T13:40:21] skrtt: Fast? Every single thing i bought there was no more than 3 days apart from that seller
[2025-07-30T13:40:32] skrtt: <photos/photo_25025@30-07-2025_13-40-32.jpg>

[2025-07-30T13:43:18] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Aaaah to send
[2025-07-30T13:43:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Yes lately they take their time in sending orders
[2025-07-30T13:43:44] skrtt: Skill issue
[2025-07-30T13:44:01] skrtt: It depends on the seller
[2025-07-30T13:44:39] skrtt: I bought some car lights and the brake levers protectors at the same time as the suspension
[2025-07-30T13:44:48] skrtt: Both took 2 days to send
[2025-07-30T13:45:15] skrtt: Except suspension cover
[2025-07-30T13:49:32] 'lekrsu': Can't do more than 135A phase on the 100100.
[2025-07-30T15:21:17] Dualtron Achilleus: Hum sad
[2025-07-30T16:41:51] Matthew: Is 135phase legit to run daily and not pushing it to where it is going to fry? With 90 battery on my 85250 I was running 220phase and definitely backflip power. But for 100/100 I am wanting best performance without it being on the edge of infant fry.
[2025-07-30T16:44:14] 'lekrsu': Your temps are higher than expected unless your climate is ungodly warm. I've ran 135A phase as long as I've had the Lonnyo, but at 20S and 60A battery current.
[2025-07-30T16:50:06] Matthew: Ambient temps are around 35°c for the logs thats me pushing it full potential for really steep hills or for heavy headwind with slight uphill. The vesc will go from 54°c to 40°c in 1 minute since I have a liquid cooling system for it. I rode around 35-38mph for around 3 miles straight and by the end of it thats where my motor temp got up to. I will change to 135amps phase. What is your absolute max set at?
[2025-07-30T16:51:19] 'lekrsu': Set it to 180 but no underlying thought behind it.
[2025-07-30T16:51:24] Matthew: I want to eventually have 20s running so I dont need field weakening to go faster. Whats your top speed without field weakening?
[2025-07-30T16:51:33] 'lekrsu': Ungodly ambient temps indeed if it's 35C! :D
[2025-07-30T16:51:56] 'lekrsu': cuz of shitty batt top speed is 65 without fwk
[2025-07-30T16:52:39] Matthew: Gotcha lol. Im used to Phoenix, az weather which gets between 46-50°c ambient
[2025-07-30T16:53:32] Matthew: Perfect for me. I want to go that speed without field weakening to feel safer electronics wise.
[2025-07-30T16:54:02] Matthew: Also I am running rear suspension so I dont want really powerful
[2025-07-30T16:54:19] 'lekrsu': Batt without insane voltage drop should go at least 70 without.
[2025-07-30T16:57:42] Matthew: Oh, I got you 👍
[2025-07-30T16:58:11] Matthew: Even better to know for voltage. And you are using 65h 17x4 right?
[2025-07-30T16:59:00] 'lekrsu': What's your top speed without fwk, ovm and mtpa?
[2025-07-30T17:02:21] Matthew: ~35mph 16s no ovm and mtpa is disabled
[2025-07-30T17:02:32] Matthew: How do you use ovm?
[2025-07-30T17:03:12] Matthew: 30mph on 14s
[2025-07-30T17:03:22] Matthew: ~ ^
[2025-07-30T17:06:39] skrtt: Can i dm u?
[2025-07-30T17:06:58] Matthew: Yes
[2025-07-30T17:15:27] 'lekrsu': Need beta however can't get it to work without stuttering.
[2025-07-30T18:21:00] Matthew: Oh, I dont need that haha. I finally tuned the stuttering out of my setup.
[2025-07-30T18:29:25] 'lekrsu': What'd you need to adjust on yours?
[2025-07-30T18:34:12] Matthew: I changed the top duty to 98% and duty cutoff start 95%. And put field weakening to start at 88% instead of 90% and 85% i lost too much torque. I use original Ortega observer and bemf coupling factor correct position. Upramp 0.3 seconds. I messed around in there to finally run smoothly and at top speed there is not hard cuts doing horrible stuff up top.

[2025-07-31T16:07:38] Noname: My friend went to a race there. They actually blocked off roads for it. My friend went out of controll and rammed a cop car with his euc. Cop didnt even care. Basically dont run over any old lady's and its whatever

[2025-08-01T00:01:14] Matthew: If your speed telemetry display is off you will need to change the diameter of the tire to get correct. Basic 10x3-6 tires are 243mm diameter
[2025-08-01T00:14:42] Paolo ⁭: He just did holes on the motor cover

[2025-08-01T00:50:40] Face de Pin Sucé: It's shit 😂
[2025-08-01T00:51:03] Face de Pin Sucé: If having 2 brake discs like this were a good idea, we would use it 🙃
[2025-08-01T00:53:12] skrtt: Why is that?
[2025-08-01T00:53:33] 'lekrsu': 4x the failure rate?
[2025-08-01T00:53:59] skrtt: Isnt the theory principal the same as in motorcycles?
[2025-08-01T00:54:20] skrtt: We need technical details here
[2025-08-01T00:54:56] haku: thats alot of space. it doesnt need to be flush it can stick out both sides a bit
[2025-08-01T00:56:58] Paolo ⁭: Why? The same thing is used on motogp and give way better performance due to less heating
[2025-08-01T00:57:35] Face de Pin Sucé: Calipers aren't designed to work on this way, the discs aren't same size, ...
[2025-08-01T00:57:49] skrtt: if the motor is designed to suport 2 disks maybe it would work
[2025-08-01T00:58:46] Face de Pin Sucé: On motoGP (or just classic sport bikes) they use dual disc with dual calipers designed for this use
[2025-08-01T00:58:58] Face de Pin Sucé: That's not for nothing if the calipers doesn't have same pistons size
[2025-08-01T00:59:13] Face de Pin Sucé: Having 2 different disc size is a non-sense
[2025-08-01T00:59:20] Face de Pin Sucé: Especially using those shit discs btw
[2025-08-01T01:00:06] Paolo ⁭: Yes but the concept is ok, just change disc and caliper and it's ok
[2025-08-01T01:00:14] skrtt: Brembo calipers for dual are the same as the single ones
[2025-08-01T01:00:33] skrtt: I dont think they are different
[2025-08-01T01:00:41] Paolo ⁭: This make way more sense than dual caliper on single disc which can cause excessive heat
[2025-08-01T01:02:28] Face de Pin Sucé: No
[2025-08-01T01:02:47] Face de Pin Sucé: Of course concept of dual disc is good, but read again my first answer
[2025-08-01T01:03:03] Face de Pin Sucé: Here, I'm saying, having it like this
[2025-08-01T01:03:54] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes it does, but first of all, try to overheat the first brake disc, then add the second one, we were using dual caliper on 180mm brakestuff 3mm disc and overheat wasn't an issue
[2025-08-01T01:04:15] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Ah that's My bros
[2025-08-01T01:04:16] Face de Pin Sucé: Braking Power is the same with 1 or 2 discs
[2025-08-01T01:09:20] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_25037@01-08-2025_01-09-20.jpg>

[2025-08-01T01:09:29] haku: donate some shekels to yours trully
[2025-08-01T01:11:18] haku: how do i get in the 140-150kmh club?
[2025-08-01T01:11:36] haku: is it possible with 20s?
[2025-08-01T01:21:45] Paolo ⁭: It does overheat, you just don't notice it because you have two caliper and the loosen power due to the heat is compensated . It's of course better than single caliper but not than dual disc
[2025-08-01T01:27:58] Mehmet Öz: where to do it ,where is the setting location ,give me picture please
[2025-08-01T02:38:42] Face de Pin Sucé: We were doing 147kmh with 20S back in the days
[2025-08-01T02:39:13] haku: nooo. 80mph only.
[2025-08-01T02:39:16] Face de Pin Sucé: We are using french made ceramic brake pads to improve that thing
[2025-08-01T02:39:51] haku: only yams that i know off i think 140+ on 20s

[2025-08-01T06:29:48] Matthew: In vesc tool under motor configuration. Under additional info click setup. In setup if youre running a basic 10x3-6 tire then 243mm is the value to enter and should be pretty accurate. On my setup running with GPS and also road radar readout on the road.

[2025-08-01T11:31:37] Face de Pin Sucé: But even in french it doesn't mean anything it's like "you have the face of a sucked tree"

[2025-08-01T14:36:14] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Both no dumper or the compact is better
[2025-08-01T15:01:19] Face de Pin Sucé: Both no damper
[2025-08-01T15:01:33] Face de Pin Sucé: Damper is useful only on track circuit to have better cornering
[2025-08-01T15:01:48] Face de Pin Sucé: But going full speed without it is easy when setup is right
[2025-08-01T15:02:04] Face de Pin Sucé: When I use RM-X in town, I set damper to lowest possible
[2025-08-01T15:04:22] Paolo ⁭: Low engineering 😂 I would put 4 steering damper
[2025-08-01T15:13:37] Face de Pin Sucé: Hahaha
[2025-08-01T16:09:12] Matthew: No it doesn't. I am using a 12v stepdown converter
[2025-08-01T16:13:34] Matthew: Red bar is both neg and pos bus bar from the 12v stepdown converter. So far running water pump, radiator/fan, horn, headlight. I still am going to setup brake lights, running lights, and turn signals.
[2025-08-01T16:15:46] Matthew: For people that are curious on why ive mentioned i don't really have any inside deck space because of the 2 85150 that are epoxy to the deck.
[2025-08-01T16:15:56] francois schempers: my SA cousin's scooters xD
[2025-08-01T16:38:31] Dualtron Achilleus: Nice water cooling
[2025-08-01T16:39:08] Dualtron Achilleus: Does it is needed for this config?
[2025-08-01T16:44:14] Matthew: I heard 100/100 gets hot fast so decided to try it out. I had first made the setup for the 85250 ubox because of the limited inside deck space i couldn't mount to the deck for a heatsink and it worked really well. I find it keeps the 100/100 stable with the heat. Heat does go a bit high for the fets but goes from 54°c to 39°c in 1 minute so thats nice and cruising is low 40°c. Ambient Temps out here is ~35°c.

[2025-08-01T19:08:05] Massimo: Good morning everyone, What connectors do you recommend for a 3000-watt 72V motor (20S4P and VESC 75100)?
[2025-08-01T19:11:02] Face de Pin Sucé: No, impossible
[2025-08-01T19:15:25] Matthew: Xt90 for battery will be fine with 10awg cable.
[2025-08-01T19:16:37] Matthew: And for the motor phase use bullet connector are good
[2025-08-01T19:18:05] Roby MacGyver: I imagined, do you know what to do?
[2025-08-01T19:18:12] Matthew: Going over 110amps battery i would recommend double xt90 or single qs8 connectors for the battery
[2025-08-01T19:19:09] Matthew: And these for phase work quite well.
[2025-08-01T19:22:13] Massimo: 6.5mm?
[2025-08-01T19:23:48] Matthew: 4mm.
[2025-08-01T19:25:36] Matthew: Others can correct me if I am wrong. Highest I have ran is 260amps phase and no issues. 6mm and 8mm are giant and dont make sense unless youre changing the phase cable size in the motor.

[2025-08-01T20:21:51] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Technically two caliper with two disc dont make more brake force but offer more endurance (more energy dissipation and inertia), but for my expérience I loose the limit of tyre grip before going to heat limitation of my single disc on hard compétition condition so, it's good but not necessary And in that case the disc is smaller so less brake force, just more endurance
[2025-08-01T20:22:52] skrtt: Why doesnt it offer morr braking power?
[2025-08-01T20:23:57] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 2 calipers, same friction rate with 1 or two disc
[2025-08-01T20:26:10] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: 2 discs double the dissipation capacity and half the heat up time at same brake power (it's what I said more endurance) but not more torque or power braking
[2025-08-01T20:26:28] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Just same power more long time if necessary
[2025-08-01T20:27:40] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Basic physics
[2025-08-01T20:35:26] skrtt: So double calipers on moto gp have the same theory? They have the same braking power but the endurance is better?
[2025-08-01T20:44:43] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Yes of course, but they going to the heat limit on each disc with Red double brake disc so it's necessary ...
[2025-08-01T20:45:08] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: But ~200kg at 300kmh it's not same as 130 at ~120
[2025-08-01T20:45:30] Paolo ⁭: Also more brake power, they have special brake lever for dual caliper.
[2025-08-01T20:45:46] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: That is another topic
[2025-08-01T20:46:04] Paolo ⁭: If you use the same brake lever so yes, same brake power
[2025-08-01T20:46:14] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: Of course size, calipers pistons pad etc affect everything
[2025-08-01T20:46:41] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: We dont compare différents brake we compare one vs two
[2025-08-01T20:47:21] Paolo ⁭: Of course I just talking about MotoGP :)
[2025-08-01T20:47:22] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: One but double size have more brake power capacity it's obvious
[2025-08-01T20:48:01] 🆁aphaël 🅵ou🅹iwara: They have carbone brake disc who cost the price of the entire our scooter lol
[2025-08-01T20:49:27] Matthew: 100/100 ubox. 16s 85amps battery 130amps phase 40amps field weakening. Lonnyo 65h 17x4 with statorade. ~80lbs scooter g30lp.
[2025-08-01T20:53:35] Matthew: The calipers heating up is also another huge concern when higher heat is involved so caliper and fluid doesn't overheat and fail.
[2025-08-01T20:58:28] haku: so much science in brakes. what about regen-ebrake only? bad?
[2025-08-01T20:58:36] haku: foot brakes bad?
[2025-08-01T21:00:54] Dualtron Achilleus: Dont use brake just go full speed on curves
[2025-08-01T21:02:40] Matthew: Regen is great in combo or emergency. I implemented regen on a Sunday. Monday heading to work going around 40mph pull the brake lever and the brake cable snapped and I was frantically trying to quickly hit the lever I have bolted to handlebar expander for accessories. I was about to run through an intersection and was able to stop
[2025-08-01T21:02:54] haku: im not gonna lie regen-ebrake only works. sketchy but no need physical brakes because its all mental and spiritual. you feel me dawgs
[2025-08-01T21:03:43] Matthew: How you will see on some cars the location of the calipers on performance cars the position to enhance/perfect weight distribution on the car for front/rear
[2025-08-01T21:04:55] haku: on electric cars tesla for example. its alot of ebrake-regen. you barely use your physical brakes
[2025-08-01T21:05:20] haku: once you get of the throttle its automatic ebrake
[2025-08-01T21:06:09] Matthew: Old es4-800 e-brake only

[2025-08-01T21:08:32] Face de Pin Sucé: Extended Deck + carbon plate for Dualtron Thunder 1/2/3 Now with carbon fiber plate 390€ Availabe to delivery in 2 weeks
[2025-08-01T21:10:15] Matthew: Nice, was curious how that car functions to be most efficient. The few times I drove a prius YEARS ago I remember there was some energy button you could push and get a significant amount of regen brakes
[2025-08-01T21:10:27] skrtt: Yes but imagine a hopetech4 v4 with motorcycle lever with 3mm disk single setup. And a dual hopetech4 v4 with 2 3mm disks with same motorcycle lever. Braking power is the same then?
[2025-08-01T21:13:03] Paolo ⁭: Imagine having a 10kw controller (as brake lever) on 300w motor (as caliper)
[2025-08-01T21:13:16] Paolo ⁭: It won't work
[2025-08-01T21:20:11] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: How is it better to stop with a warm or cold engine or is it indifferent?
[2025-08-01T21:22:17] Matthew: I have not felt a difference...
[2025-08-01T21:24:01] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I think if you do it hot the engine runs cooler but I'm not sure about that, that's my question.
[2025-08-01T21:25:21] haku: very efficient. specially when you let car drive itself. i think it only uses regen-ebrake.
[2025-08-01T21:25:48] Matthew: Regen stopping sends current back through the controller so its actually the controller that gets hotter. I have never seen the motor temps go up while using regen. Ive been up as high as 105°c for motor.
[2025-08-01T21:28:50] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Let's change the question 🤣🤣 Is it better to do hot or cold detection?
[2025-08-01T21:50:03] skrtt: Speaking of brakes
[2025-08-01T21:52:16] skrtt: Can anyone give me a guide on how to bleed magura properly? Yesterday i change the lever to a new one. Thought it was well bled but it wasnt. Tried to bleed once more and results were the same. I bleed them the same way all the time but results are not the same
[2025-08-01T21:52:51] skrtt: Im willing to pay if someone teach me how to bleed them good
[2025-08-01T21:54:12] skrtt: For ex my back brake is always well bled after changing pads. I only have problems with the front one
[2025-08-01T21:56:17] Matthew: https://youtu.be/DsqlEYJeLQU?si=nSrP1kMm8fzKk2AL
[2025-08-01T21:56:44] Matthew: I have zoom brakes and similar to the video
[2025-08-01T21:57:47] Matthew: Normal ambient temps is what you should be setting things up so that temp compensation can be more accurate.
[2025-08-01T22:19:39] skrtt: Is it important to have the caliper the same height as the lever?

[2025-08-01T22:38:20] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I don't have any more highway, I always have the same speed between 140/145
[2025-08-01T22:38:41] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: rs500 🤣
[2025-08-01T22:39:43] 爆弾 👹💣⚠️ ...: Yes, I saw that you don't exceed 145 but it's not bad at all but it should deliver a little more power. I don't understand much about vesc but a g300 according to its characteristics should weld a little more.

[2025-08-02T02:08:19] Rose: Hey there ༒ xUnkn0wn™ ༒, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-08-02T06:04:56] Roby MacGyver: How is it better to stop with a warm or cold engine or is it indifferent?
[2025-08-02T06:04:56] Roby MacGyver: Good morning, before I do something stupid, I ask, if I connect ADC1 to GND with a button, every time I press the button does it change the profiles? Thanks
[2025-08-02T06:05:35] Roby MacGyver: Can someone please help me install this key to turn on the VESC control unit and also power the lights that work at 58.8 volts? Thank you very much.
[2025-08-02T06:22:26] Matthew: No, you just need to work with gravity. Flicking or tapping the brake line helps move tiny air bubbles up. And for the handle you want it level mainly to fill it completely with zero air bubbles and then close the screw on the handle and it should be good. Sometimes theres still some remaining bubbles that just you need to repeat the procedure and hopefully 2nd time is good.
[2025-08-02T06:27:38] Matthew: Someone told me theyre running 135amps max phase and absolute is 180amps phase. I have mine set at 130amps phase and 150abs. I am running 85 or 90 battery and temps for vesc are staying good. This person has been running their setup for like 8 months almost daily and they told me they are good. This is my first 100/100 so thats why I am sharing more, also because it seems almost no one buys the 100/100 because they mainly all want high power. The purpose i built the g30lp to is good and it goes up hills i want. With it having a rear suspension i dony really trust going really fast like that
[2025-08-02T06:54:03] Jason: it does have but not exposed
[2025-08-02T06:54:16] Jason: using a external like you prob is much better
[2025-08-02T07:44:50] Roby MacGyver: pleaseee help meeee😭
[2025-08-02T07:49:23] Jason: who told that info
[2025-08-02T07:49:35] Jason: because its very wrong
[2025-08-02T07:49:54] Roby MacGyver: ok if you know how to put it right tell me please thanks
[2025-08-02T07:54:16] Franchesco Carofano: <sticker>
[2025-08-02T16:05:42] Rose: Hey there Manuel, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-08-02T19:22:13] skrtt: Its perfect now
[2025-08-02T19:23:42] skrtt: I think the trick is to be patient when flicking the lever and do it for a long time. Also flicking the line when pressing the lever helps with the smaller bubbles
[2025-08-02T19:36:58] Matthew: Yeah, very important to take time and make sure all bubbles of air are out. Any tiny bubbles compound the squishy feeling and reduced pressure
[2025-08-02T19:44:12] Matthew: Where would it be?
[2025-08-02T19:45:01] Matthew: I have this one
[2025-08-02T19:50:18] Matthew: This one has the 12v ports.... I missed that there is a 100/100 model with 12v ports. So far this stepdown converter is working well, I am just concerned that the converter will draw too much power and cause a bms cut. My battery is internal basic 60v pack bms without lines or Bluetooth for me to connect
[2025-08-02T19:52:05] skrtt: I think the magura royal blood is thinner than shimano oil for ex. I think is easier to bleed with shimano oil
[2025-08-02T19:56:00] Matthew: I gotcha. I have the zoom brakes and it is the kit used with Shimano i purchased.
[2025-08-02T20:29:43] Paolo ⁭: This model has the mos temperature rising faster than the speed
[2025-08-02T20:38:36] Matthew: Gotcha. Glad I got the other version. Mine is the model with caps exposed.
[2025-08-02T20:39:02] Matthew: He's a tiny water cooled guy...

[2025-08-02T23:38:38] Mattia: Wich motor do u have?
[2025-08-02T23:48:41] 'lekrsu': Looks great
[2025-08-03T02:50:45] Noname: 5a on a 12v dc/dc is only like 1a on a 60v pack
[2025-08-03T03:29:09] Matthew: So 12v 20amps converter off 60v only like 4-5 amps from big pack?
[2025-08-03T03:29:28] Matthew: Am i understanding correctly?
[2025-08-03T03:29:38] Noname: Yeah if you use 20a
[2025-08-03T03:30:10] Noname: Might be more like 6a with losses etc
[2025-08-03T03:30:31] Matthew: Ok, great to know. Yes, I got a 20 amps converter so that in my mind thinking the load that will be on it will be under 20amps so hopefully not get hot
[2025-08-03T03:30:48] Matthew: Ive never used the converter before
[2025-08-03T03:31:04] Noname: High voltage low amps
[2025-08-03T03:31:26] Noname: And vice versa for equivalent power or watts
[2025-08-03T03:32:15] Matthew: Would you personally leave battery amps at 90 which is bms rating from yume without Bluetooth or cable bms to communicate with... or should I program 85amps because of the converter?
[2025-08-03T03:33:31] Noname: Should always be lower power draw than bms supply's but they do have peak for safety
[2025-08-03T03:33:36] Matthew: I dont want to have all accessories pull the 20amps when I push the horn and trip a bms cut
[2025-08-03T03:33:58] Noname: 20a is a lot
[2025-08-03T03:34:06] Noname: What you powering
[2025-08-03T03:34:13] Noname: A toaster
[2025-08-03T03:34:49] Matthew: Lightbar, horn, fan, water pump, (signals and brake lights in near future).
[2025-08-03T03:35:00] Noname: Led bulbs?
[2025-08-03T03:35:58] Matthew: Running lights as well. Yes led. Running lights will be very low watt + the led chip i will install in jrev fender.
[2025-08-03T03:36:10] Matthew: "Running lights"*
[2025-08-03T03:36:24] Matthew: <photos/photo_25062@03-08-2025_03-36-24.jpg>
[2025-08-03T03:36:46] Matthew: Top lightbar is rechargeable device
[2025-08-03T03:37:04] Noname: Biggest draw is gonna be a horn
[2025-08-03T03:37:53] Matthew: I will lower battery amps to 84amps to feel safer
[2025-08-03T03:38:21] Noname: Pump is 4 watts lol
[2025-08-03T03:38:29] Noname: .1a on 60v
[2025-08-03T03:38:32] Matthew: I was not knowing the vdrop I get and yesterday 90amps battery i was losing 4v
[2025-08-03T03:38:48] Matthew: Haha. Nice.
[2025-08-03T03:39:09] Matthew: I am just blind trying to figure stuff out. Thank you
[2025-08-03T07:18:16] Matthew: I guess this is a motor up my alley for the yume....

[2025-08-03T19:28:25] Matthew: It is gonna be a bit before I have money for the motor, but I do believe that will be the motor i get when I have the money. Ill let you know. I got the 65h 17x4 in end of April and didnt have any customs tax.
[2025-08-03T19:38:46] Matthew: I have this
[2025-08-03T19:38:56] Matthew: This
[2025-08-03T19:39:03] Matthew: This
[2025-08-03T19:39:27] Matthew: Getting something like these for jrev fender.
[2025-08-03T19:39:57] Matthew: Running lights and brakes and signals should be extremely low draw.
[2025-08-03T19:40:50] Matthew: This fan i can't find a power rating but tiny tiny wires must mean power draw is low...
[2025-08-03T19:55:18] Pandalgns: Hi guys, how's everything going? I have a question: what BMS do you recommend for a MoliCel P45B 22S10P battery? I'm going to order the BMS now, but I can't decide which one to buy. I haven't seen any ant models with more than 420A continuous, and according to the datasheet, my battery for these cells would be at 450A continuous. Any recommendations?
[2025-08-03T19:58:13] Noname: Use 2 bms
[2025-08-03T19:58:33] skrtt: Isnt 450 peak?
[2025-08-03T19:58:56] Pandalgns: I'm planning to put two download ports since they are two controllers, so the option you propose doesn't seem bad to me, to be honest.
[2025-08-03T19:59:22] Pandalgns: According to the Molicel datasheet, the P45B states 45A of continuous discharge.
[2025-08-03T20:01:07] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_25080@03-08-2025_20-01-07.jpg>
[2025-08-03T20:01:34] skrtt: Yeah i see
[2025-08-03T20:01:53] skrtt: So whats the peak discharge on those cells
[2025-08-03T20:01:53] Pandalgns: What I find strange is that they don't specify the peak.
[2025-08-03T20:02:02] skrtt: Jean
[2025-08-03T20:02:05] skrtt: Yeah
[2025-08-03T20:02:40] Pandalgns: 🤷‍♂
[2025-08-03T20:05:33] skrtt: <photos/photo_25082@03-08-2025_20-05-33.jpg>
[2025-08-03T20:07:01] skrtt: Ive seen somewhere 90A for like 5s
[2025-08-03T20:23:47] Paolo ⁭: Continuos means maximum continuos
[2025-08-03T20:24:41] skrtt: So max they can discharge is 45a?
[2025-08-03T20:26:19] Paolo ⁭: It's the suggested max current
[2025-08-03T20:27:13] Paolo ⁭: For example Samsung 50e is suggested for 15A max, but Numo discharge them at 50A peak🤣
[2025-08-03T20:28:01] skrtt: But is there any limit?
[2025-08-03T20:29:29] Paolo ⁭: There not exist a limit, the limit is cell overheating. Of course using at more than recommended will cause earlier degradation and internal chemical damage
[2025-08-03T21:50:01] haku: Noname weld my g30 dropouts to fit this badboy.
[2025-08-03T21:50:40] Noname: Sure send
[2025-08-03T21:50:45] Pandalgns: I don't intend to ask the battery for more than 300-350 amps 😂😂 I'll be able to sleep peacefully
[2025-08-03T21:51:01] haku: send all including frame and brakes yea?
[2025-08-03T21:51:02] Noname: Buy my stock bosch
[2025-08-03T21:51:18] haku: eew
[2025-08-03T21:51:50] haku: bosch is german brand. im not a fan
[2025-08-03T21:52:02] Noname: Du hast
[2025-08-03T21:53:01] Noname: @Bradhaku that wheel.is bigger than the bike
[2025-08-03T21:53:16] haku: 12"
[2025-08-03T21:53:42] Noname: 12" rim with 16.5" tire vs 6" and 11 tire
[2025-08-03T21:53:51] haku: i see
[2025-08-03T21:55:39] Noname: <photos/photo_25084@03-08-2025_21-55-39.jpg>
[2025-08-03T21:56:57] haku: thats not the same motor is it?
[2025-08-03T21:57:03] Noname: Does this clear up 11" tire vs 12" rim
[2025-08-03T21:57:32] haku: dam
[2025-08-03T21:57:40] haku: need a 16" bmx frame
[2025-08-03T21:58:01] Noname: Thats a cement barricade that holds back water
[2025-08-03T21:58:32] haku: good answer my intellectual friend. but im no longer an intellectual
[2025-08-03T21:59:05] Noname: <animation>
[2025-08-03T21:59:56] Noname: @Bradhaku that bosch motor has sprocket threads on it
[2025-08-03T22:00:06] haku: oh thats right
[2025-08-03T22:00:21] haku: how wide is it? the dropout?
[2025-08-03T22:00:42] Noname: Idk 200 or something
[2025-08-03T22:02:11] Noname: Pay shipping you can have it
[2025-08-03T22:02:23] Noname: New one is 200 so same then
[2025-08-03T22:23:32] haku: ill find a frame for it first. thanks big dawgs
[2025-08-03T22:28:20] Matthew: That puts things into real perspective 😮
[2025-08-03T22:30:10] Dualtron Achilleus: Its 6,5 vs 12??
[2025-08-03T23:11:37] haku: no suspension. peak cornering
[2025-08-03T23:27:23] Noname: Yeah and that's actually a front emoped tire
[2025-08-03T23:38:08] ✨🇪🇸عمر: <video_file>
[2025-08-03T23:38:09] ✨🇪🇸عمر: 🥲🥲🥲
[2025-08-03T23:39:38] haku: those are super sticky tires.
[2025-08-03T23:41:27] Matthew: Damn, I had to weld up a huge batch of parts many years ago because the cut was barely off in dimension to where once the part itself was welded every single rivet type hole had cracked outer edge
[2025-08-03T23:49:51] ✨🇪🇸عمر: I had custom discs made, I'm waiting and I'll get some more, there's more on the market which is interesting
[2025-08-03T23:52:54] AG.racing: For a 20s battery, I advise you to put a little more than 84v.
[2025-08-04T00:08:49] Pandalgns: That wouldn't be worth it for me 😂😂 Just leaving the house I have such a jump that both wheels go up in the air 😂😂
[2025-08-04T00:14:24] haku: yea why do racing dudes prefer really hard or no supension is it because of cornering?
[2025-08-04T00:15:28] haku: i can live with no suspension got used to it. my wepoor rear always bottomed out i remember
[2025-08-04T00:17:21] Dualtron Achilleus: yeah no front rear move when no suspension
[2025-08-04T00:17:41] Dualtron Achilleus: also help for front tire to get more grip cuz the rear
[2025-08-04T00:17:48] haku: i see
[2025-08-04T00:17:51] Dualtron Achilleus: wont down
[2025-08-04T00:18:06] Dualtron Achilleus: i use soft cuz street
[2025-08-04T00:18:29] Dualtron Achilleus: but on track no suspension is easy to master and more performing
[2025-08-04T00:18:43] Pandalgns: Similar to cars with low and hard suspension
[2025-08-04T00:19:47] Matthew: https://youtube.com/shorts/_wzuf95kreU?si=xF0JrDoonAK1WZhj
[2025-08-04T00:20:10] Pandalgns: That's the problem, on the track you can afford to have a suspension like that, on the street it's crazy 😂😂 although I have to change the oil in the front shock absorbers for a denser one so that they go a little harder, in a curve I accelerate and when I lift the shock absorber it loses grip and I almost fall 2 or 3 times now
[2025-08-04T00:20:12] haku: i cut the springs on my civic. didnt help lol
[2025-08-04T00:20:25] haku: made it bouncy
[2025-08-04T00:20:33] Pandalgns: Cutting springs doesn't usually work out well 😂😂
[2025-08-04T00:20:45] haku: but i put tein coilovers after. haha
[2025-08-04T00:22:00] Dualtron Achilleus: yeah street no choice to use soft will be slow asf on sheety road
[2025-08-04T00:22:37] Dualtron Achilleus: scary to lose grip on cornering
[2025-08-04T00:22:50] Pandalgns: In my town there are many speed bumps, bad roads, paths... I can't go without support 😊
[2025-08-04T00:23:15] Dualtron Achilleus: what scooter you have
[2025-08-04T00:23:15] Matthew: https://youtube.com/shorts/PAEQ5p7jdTc?si=AOVTRKGRPHXhQtgl
[2025-08-04T00:23:55] Pandalgns: A few days ago, I took a sharp bend at 50km/h, on shiny worn asphalt... I accelerated and crossed from one lane to another, losing the front wheel. My balls were in a knot 😂😂
[2025-08-04T00:24:06] Pandalgns: Halo t107 pro
[2025-08-04T00:24:30] Dualtron Achilleus: on vesc?
[2025-08-04T00:24:32] haku: how is it now with the new axles and phases?
[2025-08-04T00:24:38] Pandalgns: Yep
[2025-08-04T00:24:44] Pandalgns: Always
[2025-08-04T00:24:47] Pandalgns: 😂😂
[2025-08-04T00:24:49] Dualtron Achilleus: what battery
[2025-08-04T00:25:22] Pandalgns: The original one is a piece of shit 😂😂 that's why I don't have as much power as I would like but I have this one on the work table
[2025-08-04T00:25:34] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_25087@04-08-2025_00-25-34.jpg>
[2025-08-04T00:26:05] Dualtron Achilleus: good
[2025-08-04T00:26:09] Dualtron Achilleus: p45b?
[2025-08-04T00:26:21] Pandalgns: It's going very well, I fixed the hall sensors and it's going great, although the battery is getting weaker and weaker, the original one is dying 😂
[2025-08-04T00:26:25] Pandalgns: Yep
[2025-08-04T00:26:26] Dualtron Achilleus: yeah stock bat iknow this i was on it for 4 month
[2025-08-04T00:27:08] Pandalgns: It doesn't even reach 66.5v maximum charge anymore 😂😂
[2025-08-04T00:27:21] Pandalgns: He has little life left
[2025-08-04T00:27:27] Dualtron Achilleus: why not offset design to gain place ?
[2025-08-04T00:28:02] Pandalgns: The block is 20s10p but in the box I have another 20 cells, it will be 22s10p
[2025-08-04T00:28:12] Pandalgns: 2 sets lying down
[2025-08-04T00:28:23] haku: that layout can fit?
[2025-08-04T00:28:27] Pandalgns: And the remaining space in front of the lying series the bms
[2025-08-04T00:29:01] Pandalgns: I have a drawer extender in the halo, gain extra space
[2025-08-04T00:29:06] haku: dang very different from laotie frame then.
[2025-08-04T00:29:34] Pandalgns: 20s10p fits into my original drawer with just a finger's margin ahead
[2025-08-04T00:30:00] haku: yea same. but my layout zigzag
[2025-08-04T00:30:28] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_20701@08-01-2025_16-49-55.jpg>
[2025-08-04T00:30:33] Pandalgns: 20s10p
[2025-08-04T00:30:40] haku: nice
[2025-08-04T00:31:09] Pandalgns: And there are a few millimeters left on the sides, just enough for the heat shrink.
[2025-08-04T00:31:33] Dualtron Achilleus: thats really close haha
[2025-08-04T00:31:44] Pandalgns: Too close 😂😂
[2025-08-04T00:31:57] Dualtron Achilleus: didnt you take in count box around battery
[2025-08-04T00:32:05] Dualtron Achilleus: i mean vrap
[2025-08-04T00:32:33] Pandalgns: It is not visible in the photo but there is about 1 millimeter on each side.
[2025-08-04T00:33:20] Pandalgns: Yes, it will come in under pressure 😂😂
[2025-08-04T00:33:47] Pandalgns: But better, that way it won't move inside 😂😂
[2025-08-04T00:34:11] Dualtron Achilleus: yeah haha
[2025-08-04T00:49:49] ausias: custom discss???
[2025-08-04T00:49:59] ausias: where did you get those

[2025-08-04T10:47:18] Dxniel: All fiido frames. They either cut and add suspension. Or add extenders.
[2025-08-04T10:47:38] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: And how much he charge ?(Maybe after I build q1 some others friends will want too)
[2025-08-04T10:47:45] Dxniel: But everyones throwing their frames, mostly swapping to q2

[2025-08-04T10:53:20] Dxniel: Ill check for you
[2025-08-04T10:53:29] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: As you can see here instead of weld there is bults

[2025-08-04T12:01:48] Chen Simhony: Wheel is 8.5 with 10 inch tire are you sure 203?
[2025-08-04T12:04:30] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <photos/photo_25112@04-08-2025_12-04-30.jpg>
[2025-08-04T13:33:42] Roby MacGyver: to configure the speed you also act on the poles in this case I saw 30 pole written. For example I have 14 and I set the wheel to 100 mm
[2025-08-04T13:41:46] Noname: <animation>
[2025-08-04T13:42:10] Roby MacGyver: <photos/photo_25113@04-08-2025_13-42-10.jpg>
[2025-08-04T13:42:45] Roby MacGyver: so the speed is perfect with GPS
[2025-08-04T13:47:29] Roby MacGyver: now I have it set up like this at the same speed but the wheel is more correct because I put 250 mm I have an 11 inch rim 90/80/6.5 is it correct?so in the end my motor has 36 poles?
[2025-08-04T13:55:14] ausias: this week has to be ready 🥺😭
[2025-08-04T13:55:41] skrtt: U paint it??
[2025-08-04T13:56:08] ausias: not yet, but its painted from the previous owner
[2025-08-04T13:56:20] skrtt: Btw it will be only for circuit after this year?
[2025-08-04T13:56:32] ausias: i dont think
[2025-08-04T13:56:48] skrtt: Its 2027 sorry
[2025-08-04T13:56:54] ausias: i know

[2025-08-04T15:16:05] Dxniel: What tyres? My pmt slick is accurate at 265/266
[2025-08-04T15:18:44] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, to be more precise, you would have to measure with a meter, but the measurement of 11 inches is 279.4, Siri told me 🤣
[2025-08-04T15:19:51] Dxniel: Yes sure but 279 will show 150kmh topspeed 🤣 in gps you are doing 60 🤣
[2025-08-04T15:22:22] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Measure the wheel with a meter, that is the exact measurement of your wheel, but the 11-inch one is this one.
[2025-08-04T15:40:08] ausias: dammm
[2025-08-04T15:40:29] ausias: could i send you dm?

[2025-08-04T16:51:31] Roby MacGyver: ok thanks
[2025-08-04T16:53:38] Roby MacGyver: I'm still waiting for an angel fall to the sky to help me to configure a button or a switch that allows me to change profiles, thanks
[2025-08-04T16:54:18] Roby MacGyver: siri?😱hoo my god🤣
[2025-08-04T16:58:27] Massimo: What size air chamber is needed for a 10*3 CST tire? In the kit they gave me a 10*2
[2025-08-04T17:02:02] Face de Pin Sucé: 272mm to have the real speed with PMT 90 T41 for example
[2025-08-04T17:49:31] Dxniel: At what psi?? I have my t41 90 at 266mm to be accurate
[2025-08-04T18:03:29] Matthew: The vesc doesn't count pole pairs. Count amount of magnets and enter that value. Lonnyo 65h motor is 30 poles. Vsett 10+ motor is 30 poles. And as someone else mentioned for the 6.5" rim is 30 pole. Then you want direct drive in the setup. Then enter the diameter of your tire. Then check GPS while riding to verify that your tire diameter is correct. Just also to know the vesc vaguely speaking doesn't care about speed unless you're trying to use traction control or set max rpm for speed. Otherwise the correct diameter helps give you correct estimates of power consumed avg and estimated range left. I keep it accurate since i depend on all the different read outs
[2025-08-04T18:10:24] Matthew: This is available but I am not sure if it requires using a dedicated dual controller combo thats 2 units in 1.
[2025-08-04T18:10:43] Matthew: I dont know if it must pair with these vesc units to work properly
[2025-08-04T18:14:35] Roby MacGyver: Thanks, but a friend of mine bought this board and burned 2 of them, and it's very expensive. They told me that by connecting a button to the wires of the Makerbase 75100 board you can change the profiles.
[2025-08-04T18:17:03] Matthew: They burned the adc3 board itself? What are you connecting on the maker 75100 to change profiles?
[2025-08-04T18:17:38] Matthew: I am wanting to buy that adc3 board so I can get brake lights and turn signals.
[2025-08-04T18:18:52] Roby MacGyver: my motor kukirin g4 engine with 11 inch wheel 90/80/6.5,with makerbase vesc 75100 set to 250 mm and 36 poles is perfect with the gps
[2025-08-04T18:20:49] Roby MacGyver: I don't know why but he burned 2 of them by themselves, he is an expert and connected them perfectly, we don't know why they burned
[2025-08-04T18:21:52] Matthew: Ok. Interesting.
[2025-08-04T18:22:06] Roby MacGyver: I change profiles with my cell phone, but I would like something more practical
[2025-08-04T18:29:07] Matthew: You mentioned a button for maker to change profiles, what are you connecting to?
[2025-08-04T18:29:59] Matthew: Why does the power bounce all over the place?
[2025-08-04T18:32:50] Roby MacGyver: this is exactly what I don't know artificial intelligence tells me to put adc1 with gnd, I would like to try if nothing burns
[2025-08-04T18:33:27] Matthew: 10x3. or 10x2.5 minimum. Slightly smaller tube can make install a little easier to not pinch the tube
[2025-08-04T18:33:30] skrtt: Maybe 1.9-2 bars for track
[2025-08-04T18:35:52] Dxniel: I have rear 1.9 T41 100 and 1.4 on front.
[2025-08-04T18:36:16] Dxniel: What psi do you suggest for street/road
[2025-08-04T18:44:33] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I don't know, I accelerate at full speed 🤷‍♀️
[2025-08-04T18:45:00] Matthew: Gotcha. Interesting
[2025-08-04T18:47:49] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I only stop accelerating for 1 or 2 seconds at 130/135 then I accelerate back to full speed.

[2025-08-04T20:54:58] haku: thats sick
[2025-08-04T20:55:45] Pandalgns: Oh, I didn't know this. Can it be done with any switch? I have a 3-mode switch (1, 2, and 3). I understand I could put 3 profiles on it and configure it in the ADC1 so I could change them, right?
[2025-08-04T20:56:02] haku: if i cant even understand all of vesc. theres no way ill understand fardriver ui
[2025-08-04T20:56:16] skrtt: Cst need more pressure i think
[2025-08-04T20:56:29] skrtt: Specially to get them as round as possible
[2025-08-04T20:56:41] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Naaaa I like life and teeth
[2025-08-04T20:56:42] Roby MacGyver: I don't know, I haven't tried it yet

[2025-08-04T20:57:19] Roby MacGyver: if I inflate them more they become like stone too hard,remember they are tubeless
[2025-08-04T20:58:12] Roby MacGyver: with my weight of 85 kg it flows very well
[2025-08-04T20:58:18] skrtt: But their are not good for cornering. Specially under inflated
[2025-08-04T20:58:18] Pandalgns: I'll have to try it, although a 2-mode switch would also work, hiding it somewhere so I can have 2 speeds, one at 25km/h and another completely unlimited due to the police issue here in Spain.
[2025-08-04T20:58:28] skrtt: If it works for u good
[2025-08-04T20:58:37] skrtt: Im just yapping
[2025-08-04T20:59:27] Roby MacGyver: no trust me they are pretty hard, to do curves with your knee on the ground
[2025-08-04T20:59:54] Pandalgns: But first I should fix the connector for the hall sensors on the rear controller to get it to start 😭😭 although in the mks hp series they start by themselves, poor connector design
[2025-08-04T21:00:37] Roby MacGyver: same problem here in Italy in fact I would like two maps one 25 km per hour the other unlimited
[2025-08-04T21:00:59] Roby MacGyver: 👍
[2025-08-04T21:01:32] Pandalgns: Exactly the same as me, if you do any tests before me, show me 😁
[2025-08-04T21:01:45] haku: how no helmet and no physical brakes just foot brakes?

[2025-08-05T02:59:56] Noname: Would need to sleep over its 460mi trip
[2025-08-05T03:00:44] Noname: Hard to get someone to go long distance. Just around to get food is it really. And I live 40miles from everyone
[2025-08-05T03:01:18] Noname: Id even get a side car so Haku could nap if he were close
[2025-08-05T03:01:54] Noname: Just always alone 😔 I dont mind most of the time but seeing cool shit by yourself sucks
[2025-08-05T03:07:34] Matthew: I am right there with you. I found a strip in scottsdale when in that area living and there was just a bunch of people on the trails so it half way felt like I was out with someone lol.
[2025-08-05T03:08:51] Matthew: Since im a metal head I end up basically going to every single concert in my life alone

[2025-08-05T03:22:24] Noname: Ya gotta earn the adventure there ain't no drive up windows for these treats
[2025-08-05T03:22:52] skrtt: How far from civilization do u go?
[2025-08-05T03:23:41] Noname: Um that was a rocky muddy swamp road thet then popped out on a tolerable gravel path lol
[2025-08-05T03:24:33] Noname: Literally not far from civilization but it was an abandoned road after the bridge. The other side is a camp road
[2025-08-05T03:25:04] Noname: I try not to die alone in the woods but I get lost sometimes

[2025-08-05T18:38:35] GABE: Just to be certain
[2025-08-05T18:38:59] GABE: Motor is cooked, he said he doesn't wanna deal with it anymore. I'm pretty sure I got myself a free frame.

[2025-08-05T19:05:17] 'lekrsu': Mosfets can be left open and do that, sure. Make sure probes aren't mismatched, then it'll always show continuity regardless.
[2025-08-05T19:09:16] Paolo ⁭: Is more likely capacitor, is normal when is full discharged

[2025-08-05T21:14:25] Paolo ⁭: It's a scam, they will email you and ask you to pay outside of Amazon. Then the scam will happen.

[2025-08-05T21:15:29] Paolo ⁭: When you see so good offer and it's sold and shipped by third part it's 100% scam
[2025-08-05T21:16:11] haku: i dont use amazon anymore.

[2025-08-05T21:33:05] Chen Simhony: i don't believe it would "explode" check there is no leaking from the cable or caliper then do a full bleed from caliper and out from handle might make it stiffer
[2025-08-05T21:37:21] haku: bus is battery and phase is phase

[2025-08-05T21:39:22] Paolo ⁭: Nobody work to lose money, the price error are only for Amazon shipped product. That's why I said if it's shipped by third part it's 100% scam

[2025-08-05T23:48:21] Smart Repair: Putting a 10mm aluminum plate under the ESC and throwing out the entire water cooling system is utter nonsense.
[2025-08-06T00:00:41] Smart Repair: ANT BMS That should meet all your requirements
[2025-08-06T00:01:11] Matthew: What are you meaning?
[2025-08-06T00:05:19] Smart Repair: That you don't need water cooling for your setup. ESC - thermal paste - thick aluminum block of thermal paste - frame. I've never had any problems with it. And certainly not with a 130A phase. 😅

[2025-08-07T01:59:02] haku: no way nd 72450 will pair well with a qs motor
[2025-08-07T01:59:13] haku: theres no way. its not made for it
[2025-08-07T02:00:44] haku: never in my life ive seen qs motors paired with far fars. only vesc
[2025-08-07T02:00:49] Noname: I would never
[2025-08-07T02:01:00] haku: do not!
[2025-08-07T02:01:17] haku: never at that price
[2025-08-07T02:01:31] Noname: I just wanted to see what evil looked like. Now I know for science and unicorns alike
[2025-08-07T02:03:12] haku: dam yesterday it was $5 less too bad

[2025-08-07T03:58:27] Noname: Please I've been looking for change in my couch since before it was cool
[2025-08-07T03:58:56] Noname: I'll have 12$ after paying my mortgage late this month
[2025-08-07T03:59:27] haku: late fees is normal
[2025-08-07T03:59:35] haku: thats the new norm
[2025-08-07T03:59:39] Noname: Only after 2 weeks
[2025-08-07T03:59:43] Noname: Or so
[2025-08-07T04:28:29] Matthew: The little i looked seems nice. What price did you say the powder coat estimate was for something 🤔
[2025-08-07T04:30:24] Matthew: How difficult is it to run 32s?
[2025-08-07T04:30:37] Matthew: What do I need to do 32s?
[2025-08-07T04:35:19] Matthew: I know i asked this a good while back, but I dont remember how much should it cost to change fets on spintend 100/100? Is it possible to achieve 85150 capabilities?
[2025-08-07T05:43:37] haku: wtf elon
[2025-08-07T05:49:18] Noname: Ooh that heart rate buddy it knows
[2025-08-07T05:51:23] haku: he can read my vitals
[2025-08-07T05:52:47] Noname: All blood flow has stopped to penis. Lack of testosterone is keeping you from driving to fast
[2025-08-07T05:56:14] Noname: https://www.facebook.com/share/r/1BBDZtPWwN/
[2025-08-07T05:56:35] Noname: Ok ordered a 7000mm motor for my vsett should be here soon
[2025-08-07T06:49:52] haku: this is why no abs this summer.
[2025-08-07T07:34:44] Jason: there will be a abs overcurrent tho
[2025-08-07T07:34:50] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-08-07T07:39:50] Paolo ⁭: They are two different board, they have different board so no. But if you mean heat performance yes, changing MOSFET is enough. You can ask local electronic store or contact @jamessoderstrom , che k which one is cheaper
[2025-08-07T07:42:19] Roby MacGyver: adc1 gnd,you have to try a lot, nothing happens, either it works or it doesn't
[2025-08-07T07:49:48] Roby MacGyver: Screenshot (7 ago 2025 07:49:37)
[2025-08-07T07:50:07] Roby MacGyver: this is what I wrote on Google
[2025-08-07T09:33:00] Dualtron Achilleus: Cl350
[2025-08-07T10:53:45] Paolo ⁭: It's possible but you have to know coding , and you have to mod firmware. There's easier way like buying Xiaomi display and use the ready lisp
[2025-08-07T11:02:26] 'lekrsu': You can 'switch gears' through adc2. Shared a proof of context script in this group with similar features. Can't personally use it because of adc line noise though. https://t.me/VescHelpGroup/1/328397
[2025-08-07T11:58:07] Jason: its easy
[2025-08-07T11:58:27] Jason: mp2 is best for price

[2025-08-07T13:38:03] Jason: 10k
[2025-08-07T13:38:27] Jason: 100k doesn't work with ubox
[2025-08-07T13:43:37] David: I see
[2025-08-07T13:43:42] David: Thanks ;)
[2025-08-07T13:44:12] Pandalgns: I hadn't seen it hehehe and that same method could not be used but with a siwtch? Instead of using the brake, because I understand that this method is having the brake connected to the ADC2 something that I do not have connected
[2025-08-07T14:46:33] haku: what. i have 100k
[2025-08-07T14:51:50] Paolo ⁭: It works, but has low accuracy on low temperature
[2025-08-07T15:29:10] Jason: guess than Daniel's wrong

[2025-08-07T16:30:43] haku: oh boy. the end is near
[2025-08-07T16:31:16] haku: class one is pedal assist only? what about scooters?
[2025-08-07T16:32:39] Noname: Idk don't really care I dont ride the paths anymore
[2025-08-07T16:32:54] Noname: Im sure a g30 is fine but Vsett might get looks
[2025-08-07T16:33:23] haku: i do. but all i get is smiles and greetings on peak g30. because i slow down when dogs and pedestrians are close
[2025-08-07T16:34:25] haku: who would hate on a clown bike? it blends in boys. looks funny af
[2025-08-07T16:34:44] Noname: Its just the kids ripping around on whatever. I've seen mopeds dirtbikes etc. A middle aged man on a class 2 I dont think is a problem. They put the sign so they can say your def wrong when they catch the kids
[2025-08-07T16:35:53] Noname: We cross a bike bridge to get past the highway as a shortcut. We'll they put cameras there lol

[2025-08-07T16:38:15] Noname: I blew up part of a P group nickle I can't sell it like that. I'll finish it and sell.
[2025-08-07T16:38:51] haku: sell with vescs?
[2025-08-07T16:39:24] haku: no display its hard to sell unless. its a scooter modder
[2025-08-07T16:47:59] Noname: Idk won't be till spring anyway
[2025-08-07T16:48:31] Noname: Yeah needs some sort of controller
[2025-08-07T16:49:45] Noname: Plated rides from here on out though
[2025-08-07T16:52:29] Jason: hope i can finish g30 before fall begins
[2025-08-07T16:53:05] Rose: Hey there S, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-08-07T16:54:46] S Phin: doing awesome, thx
[2025-08-07T17:48:33] Roby MacGyver: all this is interesting so it can also be done with the brake but it seems to me that you have to copy and paste that program
[2025-08-07T17:59:12] 'lekrsu': Adc2 as button? Haven't explored it but I'm sure it's doable somehow ^^, button option exists after all :)
[2025-08-07T18:01:10] Pandalgns: Exactly, leave the ADC1 for its normal use of the accelerator and use the ADC2, with a programming similar to that of the use with 5 brake presses, but with a switch, style on limited off unlimited
[2025-08-07T18:01:51] Pandalgns: I understand that it would be using the same programming but instead of with pulses, acting with continuity in the adc2
[2025-08-07T18:03:48] 'lekrsu': Variable voltage vs just 3.3v/0v
[2025-08-07T18:04:02] GABE: Bet I'll finish before you
[2025-08-07T18:04:26] Jason: probably
[2025-08-07T18:04:26] Jason: I need to order bms test board
[2025-08-07T18:04:27] Jason: and esc
[2025-08-07T18:04:49] 'lekrsu': Can probably get away with vibe coding away half of the back & forth profile switch
[2025-08-07T18:04:57] GABE: Escs you mean
[2025-08-07T18:05:28] Jason: 1 esc
[2025-08-07T18:05:29] Jason: and bms
[2025-08-07T18:05:31] Jason: and dash
[2025-08-07T18:07:29] Roby MacGyver: i need only 2 brake presses,1 for 20kmh 1000watt and 2 for 70kmh 5000watt😁
[2025-08-07T18:12:12] GABE: Single motor?
[2025-08-07T18:15:44] Jason: ye
[2025-08-07T18:15:48] Jason: single build
[2025-08-07T19:08:11] Rose: Hey there Gerald GR, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-08-07T19:15:39] Gerald GR: Hello, I have a VESC 75100 and I would like to use it with a 700w Skateflash motor. It is my first controller of that type. Thank you in advance.
[2025-08-07T19:31:38] Pandalgns: And what is your question or your doubts?
[2025-08-07T19:34:00] Gerald GR: Is my First vesc controller i havent idea about Is your configuration
[2025-08-07T19:35:37] IMWurden: guys Is flipsky good or suck?
[2025-08-07T19:39:14] Слава Радченко: maybe someone has a pin out for flipsky 75100, specifically stm32, I need to connect the light to the free pins, I know that quite a few pins are involved and in theory you can add additional pins for light, etc.
[2025-08-07T19:39:46] Слава Радченко: maybe someone has a pin out for flipsky 75100, specifically stm32, I need to connect the light to the free pins, I know that quite a few pins are involved and in theory you can add additional pins for light, etc.
[2025-08-07T19:41:00] IMWurden: i have a lot of cable for it
[2025-08-07T19:41:53] Слава Радченко: What do u have
[2025-08-07T19:42:03] IMWurden: i should check if i have the one you are looking for
[2025-08-07T19:42:14] IMWurden: when i'll be home i'll check
[2025-08-07T19:42:27] Слава Радченко: Ok
[2025-08-07T19:43:21] Слава Радченко: I think for 75100 box, it is old
[2025-08-07T20:13:42] Roby MacGyver: Setting up and installing a vesc is simple and there are many videos on YouTube that will explain step by step what to do.
[2025-08-07T20:30:17] Face de Pin Sucé: Wow so much heating in controllers :o
[2025-08-07T20:31:42] Rose: Hey there Mario, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-08-07T20:34:45] Matthew: What would I be expecting off of a mosfet change on 100/100? Definitely be nice to keep heat down... does the change allow more phase amps? Like say maybe 150amps phase on 16s 90amps battery?
[2025-08-07T20:35:03] skrtt: 50/60 too much?
[2025-08-07T20:36:42] Paolo ⁭: Less heat doesn't mean more amps, because other parts of the hardware are different too. But technically for 90/150 you shouldn't have any problem
[2025-08-07T20:38:26] Matthew: Thank you for reply 🙂

[2025-08-07T20:43:04] 爆弾 👹💣⚠️ ...: sell
[2025-08-07T20:45:16] Matthew: People in here with the most issues I see are almost all related to flipsky. I hear you either get a unit that is great or you get a unit with variable levels of trash. Flipsky focuses on pure profit and quality control is trash. They sent me a bad unit. It burned up 2 of my motors. They found out their unit was bad and fried 2 of my motors and they ghosted me. I only have experience with spintend. Spintend has good quality units that just plain work every time. And their cost is reasonable. Theres some people running ~37kw dual motor on 20s
[2025-08-07T20:50:18] JPPL: No, but not as eficiente as 25
[2025-08-07T20:52:21] Paolo ⁭: He mean the temperature rising speed😂 if he continue to accelerate probably would reach 100
[2025-08-07T20:53:18] skrtt: Why that happens?
[2025-08-07T20:53:28] skrtt: Single with too much phase?
[2025-08-07T20:53:45] Paolo ⁭: I don't know which controller does he have
[2025-08-07T20:55:54] skrtt: 85250 i might be wrong
[2025-08-07T20:57:11] Paolo ⁭: For single motor setup is normal to have higher temperature specially with this engine
[2025-08-07T20:57:50] Gerald GR: I not speak English i'm using translate and i havent Programming knowledge
[2025-08-07T21:05:57] skrtt: Is this fixable? Asking for a friend
[2025-08-07T21:07:34] Dualtron Achilleus: Its g300 here not my ubox
[2025-08-07T21:08:03] skrtt: So its already installed
[2025-08-07T21:08:29] skrtt: Ive seen people saying that g300 have heating problems
[2025-08-07T21:08:36] Dualtron Achilleus: He is not really air colled by the deck
[2025-08-07T21:08:54] Dualtron Achilleus: Just fixed on the side of the U shape
[2025-08-07T21:09:03] Dualtron Achilleus: Inside
[2025-08-07T21:09:25] skrtt: Why not down
[2025-08-07T21:09:36] skrtt: Why on the side
[2025-08-07T21:09:50] Dualtron Achilleus: Because i bought like this xd
[2025-08-07T21:10:00] Dualtron Achilleus: I will put down laybe after
[2025-08-07T21:10:04] skrtt: I think ive seen the scooter that had those controllers
[2025-08-07T21:10:56] skrtt: Are they mounted on the right side of the deck?
[2025-08-07T21:11:03] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah
[2025-08-07T21:11:13] Matthew: <photos/photo_25185@07-08-2025_21-11-13.jpg>
[2025-08-07T21:11:22] Dualtron Achilleus: <photos/photo_25186@07-08-2025_21-11-22.jpg>
[2025-08-07T21:11:23] skrtt: Ive seen it then
[2025-08-07T21:11:28] Dualtron Achilleus: I bought it lik this
[2025-08-07T21:11:38] Dualtron Achilleus: For 450 € all xd
[2025-08-07T21:11:48] skrtt: Thats not the same
[2025-08-07T21:12:09] Dualtron Achilleus: Okay wasbt me so
[2025-08-07T21:12:35] Paolo ⁭: Then it's explained the temperature
[2025-08-07T21:13:15] skrtt: Just mount them down with heatsink below the deck and u good
[2025-08-07T21:13:28] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah i do it in futur
[2025-08-07T21:13:39] Dualtron Achilleus: Even if i dont need cuz i dont race
[2025-08-07T21:13:53] Matthew: https://youtu.be/QM5_vCy_uWk?si=TV5C7OQBUjRYYe1x
[2025-08-07T21:14:02] skrtt: Yes but better do it
[2025-08-07T21:14:45] Matthew: https://youtu.be/vOkU4mDSdu4?si=fLpkb3eWDt96hS7T
[2025-08-07T21:14:54] Dualtron Achilleus: Yea
[2025-08-07T21:15:22] Matthew: https://youtu.be/GbAmoEqjEhw?si=RdP6ZItcfJNC0iNV
[2025-08-07T21:15:43] skrtt: I dont know wth makerx was thinking on putting that port
[2025-08-07T21:15:55] Paolo ⁭: It won't change anything with this setup
[2025-08-07T21:16:28] Paolo ⁭: MOSFET doesn't transfer correctly the heat to aluminum plate
[2025-08-07T21:17:05] Dualtron Achilleus: I will put a serveur fan on it xd
[2025-08-07T21:17:23] Paolo ⁭: .
[2025-08-07T21:17:49] Paolo ⁭: You need Alu PCB controller
[2025-08-07T21:18:04] Dualtron Achilleus: I will open the g300 and put fan on mosfet xd
[2025-08-07T21:18:11] skrtt: Then how people race with them?
[2025-08-07T21:18:29] skrtt: They mod them or just pray they dont melt
[2025-08-07T21:18:33] Matthew: If you are using spintend, go to their website and search the unit you have and scroll down and wiring diagrams are there as well. https://spintend.com/blogs/news/diy-dual-motor-scooter-diagram-with-two-single-20s-150a-controller
[2025-08-07T21:18:40] Paolo ⁭: He's running single motor with giant 90h engine
[2025-08-07T21:18:48] Dualtron Achilleus: They put ice the deck xdd
[2025-08-07T21:19:06] skrtt: He will eventually go dual
[2025-08-07T21:19:23] Paolo ⁭: Yes with dual you will have much better temperature
[2025-08-07T21:19:31] Dualtron Achilleus: I will yeah
[2025-08-07T21:19:32] Rose: Hey there Dreuzzz, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-08-07T21:19:32] skrtt: Do u plan on keep 400phase when u go dual
[2025-08-07T21:19:57] Dualtron Achilleus: Yea maybe more cuz other motor willhelp
[2025-08-07T21:20:02] Paolo ⁭: But the big 90h eat much more current continuously than the one that people use for race
[2025-08-07T21:20:47] skrtt: More than 400phase for rear??
[2025-08-07T21:20:50] haku: @everyone look at this. here we go again. lmao
[2025-08-07T21:20:57] Dualtron Achilleus: I will go 80h 147mmstator mayb on day xd
[2025-08-07T21:21:10] Dreuzzz: new vesc user 😉🛴💨
[2025-08-07T21:21:19] Dualtron Achilleus: I will look if i gain only heat or torque
[2025-08-07T21:21:43] skrtt: Whats max? 500?
[2025-08-07T21:22:10] Dualtron Achilleus: Dont wat to go 450phase if i gain like only few torque than at 400
[2025-08-07T21:22:30] Dualtron Achilleus: Idk what g300 can go
[2025-08-07T21:22:50] skrtt: Put 500 for both and pray for the best
[2025-08-07T21:23:01] Dualtron Achilleus: Lul😅😅
[2025-08-07T21:23:26] Dualtron Achilleus: If i do 400 in my 75h 22*3 i guess it will frie really fast
[2025-08-07T21:23:50] Dualtron Achilleus: 90h is monster next to this small pp
[2025-08-07T21:26:34] skrtt: Big pp make esc too hot
[2025-08-07T21:26:58] skrtt: What winding your 90h?
[2025-08-07T21:28:43] Dualtron Achilleus: 40by2
[2025-08-07T21:28:49] Dualtron Achilleus: 25KV rated
[2025-08-07T21:31:29] haku: what is minimum now in 2025? 90h?
[2025-08-07T21:32:20] haku: 2026 100h?
[2025-08-07T21:32:27] haku: or thats the norm now?
[2025-08-07T21:32:43] Dualtron Achilleus: 2nd quarter of 2025 is 90 rewided minimum required
[2025-08-07T21:32:56] Dualtron Achilleus: with changed magnet
[2025-08-07T21:32:56] 'lekrsu': 101h

[2025-08-07T21:36:54] Dualtron Achilleus: rear wheel will look like a karting tire xd
[2025-08-07T21:38:23] Dualtron Achilleus: The way to go to be faster that others 🤣
[2025-08-07T21:51:44] Face de Pin Sucé: From 45 to 60 in less than 6s is very bad cooling
[2025-08-07T21:52:01] Face de Pin Sucé: Because G300 poor design
[2025-08-07T21:52:23] haku: everyone listen. there is a judas amongst us. a traitor. a tresonous snake that bought fardrivers. you guys will find out soon enough. prepare the gilloutine
[2025-08-07T21:52:50] Dualtron Achilleus: yaeh i noticed my ubox 85 250 temps go down lot faster
[2025-08-07T21:53:01] 'lekrsu': Angled kitchen knife enough?
[2025-08-07T21:53:15] haku: butcher knife minimum
[2025-08-07T21:53:15] 'lekrsu': Guillotines are not easy to buy
[2025-08-07T21:53:16] Dualtron Achilleus: since G300 temps isnt going under 45
[2025-08-07T21:53:29] 'lekrsu': Katana, minimum 500 year old?
[2025-08-07T21:53:40] 'lekrsu': Hell yeah
[2025-08-07T21:53:47] haku: no to fancy for this traitor

[2025-08-07T21:54:45] haku: im not gonna call him out
[2025-08-07T21:54:48] 'lekrsu': Blood Eagle then
[2025-08-07T21:54:54] haku: hes a traitor.
[2025-08-07T21:55:14] Matthew: Whats the difference? Its fresh charge and freshly powered on.
[2025-08-07T21:56:32] haku: i hope this traitor frys his motors
[2025-08-07T21:58:15] haku: Noname you are guilty of treason
[2025-08-07T21:59:30] 'lekrsu': the bottom one is phase amp hours which isn't a thing, ignore it

[2025-08-07T22:05:08] haku: thats my nature. im a born snitch. i have to report to the boys. my loyalty is to the vesc brotherhood
[2025-08-07T22:07:18] Noname: Because I throw him under the buss any chance I get 😆
[2025-08-07T22:07:52] Noname: Don't hate me guys but Vesc isnt enough girth anymore Im an "experienced" lady now
[2025-08-07T22:08:14] haku: you traitor. good deal though
[2025-08-07T22:08:17] skrtt: Gaben is watching u

[2025-08-07T22:08:34] skrtt: Vedder
[2025-08-07T22:08:45] Dualtron Achilleus: what max phase is this
[2025-08-07T22:08:45] Noname: Honestly I love Vesc but they belong on scooters etc not 300lb Emopeds
[2025-08-07T22:08:49] haku: @jamaludin_algarnati scold this non foc rider
[2025-08-07T22:09:10] skrtt: Cl1000?
[2025-08-07T22:09:24] haku: whaaat? qs motors are paired witg vesc. not fardriver.
[2025-08-07T22:09:48] 'lekrsu': Go straight DC
[2025-08-07T22:10:13] 'lekrsu': Fuck it, go steam
[2025-08-07T22:10:24] 'lekrsu': Coal moped
[2025-08-07T22:11:36] Noname: Probably can't hate this as much as my Nucular controllers
[2025-08-07T22:11:36] Noname: 680?
[2025-08-07T22:12:08] Noname: Recharge time is finding a stream and wood 😆
[2025-08-07T22:12:55] haku: the demons has whispered in your ears you let him. becaise i am that demon
[2025-08-07T22:13:05] Noname: If I could have made the emoped 2wd vesc would work

[2025-08-07T23:53:37] haku: if i can afford it all ill test em all. far far, all the vescs, bac, and sabvoton lol
[2025-08-08T00:05:24] Noname: Ok James spilled the beans. Peak g30 department is in troubled water and as a last ditch effort to gain customers Haku paid him to bug my Vesc. Right before my big debut at the Emoped convention. I feel like an Ice skater with a bum knee. 😢
[2025-08-08T00:06:13] haku: you are still vice president of haku industries. until i learn how to weld okay

[2025-08-08T00:08:57] haku: hes good dude. trust
[2025-08-08T00:20:06] Matthew: I have a question. I asked this a while back but I dont remember the answer. I have the 100/100 and I was wondering how much mosfet change would cost. What mosfets would be required. What power can I expect out of 16s-20s with a mosfet change on 100/100? Currently using 16s 90amps battery and 130amps phase
[2025-08-08T00:20:32] Matthew: <photos/photo_25196@08-08-2025_00-20-32.jpg>
[2025-08-08T00:21:17] Noname: Why not just get a bigger vesc?
[2025-08-08T00:22:16] Matthew: Even if I remove the little water cooling system I rigged up theres not room to mount an 85150... I would much more prefer to use the 85150.
[2025-08-08T00:22:40] Matthew: <photos/photo_25041@01-08-2025_16-15-46.jpg>
[2025-08-08T00:22:47] Noname: Ok I hate my Olight flashlight. Keeps unlocking and turning on in 5th pocket at full blast. Fucker gets hot
[2025-08-08T00:24:02] haku: what battery it uses?
[2025-08-08T00:24:19] haku: strong flashlights get hot
[2025-08-08T00:24:32] Noname: Idk people usually put 100 batterys there
[2025-08-08T00:25:06] Matthew: I epoxy 2 85150 in there. Thats what im trying to point out
[2025-08-08T00:25:15] Noname: Its not a huge difference if the 150 is smaller
[2025-08-08T00:25:15] Matthew: <photos/photo_25199@08-08-2025_00-25-15.jpg>
[2025-08-08T00:26:10] Matthew: I need to measure. I have it in my head that one won't fit. But now that you have me looking closer I think I can mount 85150 in there.
[2025-08-08T00:26:15] Noname: Theres so much going on in there lol
[2025-08-08T00:26:34] Noname: Well pic is a 240 also
[2025-08-08T00:26:54] Noname: I showed you
[2025-08-08T00:26:59] Noname: Short boi
[2025-08-08T00:27:04] Matthew: I mainly just want to keep the stepdown converter for my accessories
[2025-08-08T00:27:38] Noname: My rovyvon never turned on but I lost like 3 of those
[2025-08-08T00:27:51] Matthew: I have a grinder. Im afraid to pry on the 85150 for fear of bending the frame...
[2025-08-08T00:28:19] Matthew: I think I need to break down and gear up and grind them bastards out of there
[2025-08-08T00:28:51] Matthew: There
[2025-08-08T00:29:33] Matthew: Im a welder.... I break stuff lol
[2025-08-08T00:29:50] Noname: Its thick af
[2025-08-08T00:30:06] Matthew: Epoxy with squeeze out
[2025-08-08T00:30:16] Matthew: Theres no lack of epoxy
[2025-08-08T00:30:58] Matthew: I have not. Would a heat gun maybe get it hot enough to pry out?
[2025-08-08T00:31:18] Matthew: Ive never in my life dealt with removing something with epoxy
[2025-08-08T00:32:25] haku: remove the boards from the case. then pry it off
[2025-08-08T00:32:27] Matthew: I can possibly just grind a portion of the inside rail out and then I will have deck space to mount 85150
[2025-08-08T00:34:07] Matthew: Its epoxy down the side where screws are
[2025-08-08T00:34:35] haku: yea thats right my bad. im a idiot
[2025-08-08T00:35:02] Matthew: Youre all good man. Not an idiot. Im the one who epoxy the thing lol
[2025-08-08T00:35:38] haku: that 100/100 looks lonely
[2025-08-08T00:36:07] Matthew: It is. Im feeling froggy to go dual motor again 🙄
[2025-08-08T00:36:14] haku: peak g30 little chihga edition needs one
[2025-08-08T00:36:18] Matthew: All the shit I talk about dual motor lol
[2025-08-08T00:37:10] Matthew: Vsett motor +statorade is already installed
[2025-08-08T00:37:50] Matthew: Rear one fried from an assumed bms cut. Front slave survived. I bricked the front one early spring.
[2025-08-08T00:39:42] Matthew: I decided I was going to update something. Was talking to a person while that was happening and then I turned Bluetooth off. After that couldnt get anything to revive it. Tried st link thing.
[2025-08-08T00:41:43] Matthew: My brother was following everything people were saying to do and we would get stopped at a spot and couldnt continue to program as some failed error came up no matter what.
[2025-08-08T00:42:05] Matthew: He's a computer guy. It
[2025-08-08T00:42:25] Matthew: He was just following what people were guiding us on

[2025-08-08T00:49:15] haku: oh yea. tiny one
[2025-08-08T01:00:35] Matthew: Ok. I will see what I can do. Do you just connect through can like running dual vesc/ dual motor.

[2025-08-08T20:07:47] Dualtron Achilleus: no
[2025-08-08T20:08:00] Dualtron Achilleus: modified 75h
[2025-08-08T20:09:46] skrtt: Whats the difference? On being stock 66x1 and modified to 66x1
[2025-08-08T20:09:58] Dualtron Achilleus: he is 33*2 not 66*1
[2025-08-08T20:11:21] Matthew: What kind of speed mph/rpm does that motor spin?
[2025-08-08T20:11:44] Dualtron Achilleus: no one know
[2025-08-08T20:12:09] skrtt: They say its 66x1
[2025-08-08T20:12:21] Dualtron Achilleus: who they
[2025-08-08T20:12:36] Dualtron Achilleus: cuz he tell his motor KV is around 80 speed
[2025-08-08T20:12:41] Dualtron Achilleus: so 34.8KV
[2025-08-08T20:12:59] Dualtron Achilleus: and amp phase start falling at 100kmp
[2025-08-08T20:13:52] Paolo ⁭: That's when you set low batt current but high phase
[2025-08-08T20:14:12] Matthew: No, he us up around 70mph I believe. 12" rim so I think 16 inch tall tires I think 🤔
[2025-08-08T20:14:48] Paolo ⁭: Rpm not erpm
[2025-08-08T20:14:58] Dualtron Achilleus: we talk about rfp 😂
[2025-08-08T20:15:05] Matthew: No issues with track use and dust?
[2025-08-08T20:15:59] Paolo ⁭: It's meant for racing only since it would be illegal hahaha
[2025-08-08T20:16:51] skrtt: Rfp
[2025-08-08T20:17:30] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: The G300 is not very good when it heats up, which by the way, it does so very quickly and loses a lot of power. The 3chul never reached 55 degrees.
[2025-08-08T20:20:35] Dualtron Achilleus: 77 mean it start cut
[2025-08-08T20:21:41] Paolo ⁭: Why you don't put 3shul again
[2025-08-08T20:22:28] Matthew: Gotcha, here in usa we can still kinda hide under the radar depending city and state people reside
[2025-08-08T20:23:22] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I can't now, I'm working alone, I'm waiting for the summer to end.
[2025-08-08T20:23:55] Dualtron Achilleus: cuz he gift me the two😂
[2025-08-08T20:24:18] skrtt: U have 3shul also???
[2025-08-08T20:24:33] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If it loses a lot of power, this is the rear controller; the front is at 51 degrees.
[2025-08-08T20:25:45] Paolo ⁭: I don't think nobody gift 3shul for free hahaha
[2025-08-08T20:26:18] Paolo ⁭: Don't they shot you?
[2025-08-08T20:26:24] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: With the same parameters as the G300 & Schul, the rear engine only has to fire.
[2025-08-08T20:26:59] skrtt: He is not black so they only arrest him
[2025-08-08T20:27:01] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I did it to whoever I managed 🤣🤣🤣I gave him 2
[2025-08-08T20:28:07] skrtt: Bro went from 85250 to having 2x g300 and 2xc350
[2025-08-08T20:28:46] Paolo ⁭: Working One or broken one
[2025-08-08T20:29:08] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: From tronic I went to schul now g300 after vernal schul hahaha
[2025-08-08T20:29:10] Paolo ⁭: What was wrong with 85250 @AYO744 ?
[2025-08-08T20:29:48] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I've never had a ubox.
[2025-08-08T20:30:29] Paolo ⁭: I think they are the cheapest and the best choice for you

[2025-08-08T20:31:21] Matthew: Lmao! TV spreads too much bullshit. The only people that get shot are generally those asking for it. Simple traffic stop you dont just jump out of the vehicle waving your hands or items around, that gets you shot
[2025-08-08T20:33:01] Paolo ⁭: I see people get blocked by officers on motorcycle without doing nothing, and put the handcuffs on you. Is that real? Because is scary lol
[2025-08-08T20:33:24] Matthew: Albuquerque, new mexico is notorious for trigger happy inexperienced police force though. But if you dont give a cop a reason to shoot you they won't be. You shoot and injure or kill another officer then well, theyre guaranteed to be killed.
[2025-08-08T20:33:56] Matthew: Police handcuff individuals for both their safety.
[2025-08-08T20:34:51] Matthew: I mean I carry a pistol. All I have to do is make the police officer aware of where the firearm is and dont reach for it.
[2025-08-08T20:35:48] Matthew: Police are humans with family, they just decided to want to help make a hopefully positive difference in society.
[2025-08-08T20:36:18] haku: im pro police but there are bad apples. they need proper training imo
[2025-08-08T20:38:55] haku: they all need to be atleast minimum blue belt in bjj and learn how to wrestle.
[2025-08-08T20:43:22] haku: i applaud the cops that have good trigger discipline and dont result to shooting right away.
[2025-08-08T20:44:03] Matthew: I think high profile, high risk like swat gets different training than common everyday police officers. When I got woken up by 2 police officers and arrested they tried getting all physical with me. I was ~260lbs and lifted steel all day being a welder. Was hilarious the way they tried to drop me on the floor. Told them keep at it, I have you guys on camera and I will sue the fuck out of you 2. They quit trying to get me on the floor at that point. Fuckin weak inexperienced people
[2025-08-08T20:45:03] Matthew: Same man, rookies need way more training. Rookies and women are usually the worst officers you can ever deal with.
[2025-08-08T20:45:42] Matthew: Ive been in trouble with the law many times, im a veteran in getting in trouble 🙄
[2025-08-08T20:49:24] haku: spill the beans bud

[2025-08-09T17:51:12] Paolo ⁭: That's why you need skill to let it work correctly
[2025-08-09T17:51:17] Rogerio Figueiredo: But I know is not reliable
[2025-08-09T17:51:25] 'lekrsu': So many builds are also using 99.9% of the limit of their VESC models

[2025-08-09T17:52:03] Rogerio Figueiredo: So you are the one with skills and 10 people that I know all burned they don't have skill
[2025-08-09T17:52:14] Paolo ⁭: I arranged to let flipsky 75100 working over 5000km with 270a phase setting
[2025-08-09T17:52:27] Rogerio Figueiredo: Luck
[2025-08-09T17:52:46] 'lekrsu': Not luck if you can recreate it
[2025-08-09T17:52:46] Rogerio Figueiredo: Min makerbase is at 22s and has 2000km
[2025-08-09T17:53:06] Paolo ⁭: That's why you are burning much then
[2025-08-09T17:53:18] Paolo ⁭: Running 22s makerbase is suicide
[2025-08-09T17:54:09] 'lekrsu': Peak voltage rating, continuously, at peak current; turns into peak coal
[2025-08-09T17:54:49] Gerald GR: Hey guys, I have a MKSESC 75100 v1 and I have a Bluetooth module connected and it doesn't appear in the mobile app, but it appears on the computer.
[2025-08-09T17:55:54] Paolo ⁭: If you want a stable controller just get a fardriver, but forget about that power density and efficiency, and all these features
[2025-08-09T17:55:56] Rogerio Figueiredo: 2000km say otherwise
[2025-08-09T17:56:27] Rogerio Figueiredo: My friend just burned ubox dual with 16s stock firmware 50a battery and 130 phase
[2025-08-09T17:56:53] 'lekrsu': Probably caused a cutoff or other factors, killing it.
[2025-08-09T17:56:57] Rogerio Figueiredo: That was exactly what I'm saying that slvesc is not stable
[2025-08-09T17:57:01] Rogerio Figueiredo: No
[2025-08-09T17:57:14] 'lekrsu': No cutoff, no field weakening, no mtpa, no weird tuning?
[2025-08-09T17:57:22] Paolo ⁭: Many people never admit their errors
[2025-08-09T17:57:38] Paolo ⁭: My spintend 85150 also gone in 20s but with mtpa
[2025-08-09T17:58:02] Paolo ⁭: It's pretty shit that they don't tell you mtpa can't be turned on
[2025-08-09T17:58:09] Paolo ⁭: And you have to do own research
[2025-08-09T18:01:57] 'lekrsu': At least you can limit current with MTPA & FWK to some degree nowadays on 6.05+
[2025-08-09T18:03:54] Paolo ⁭: Voltage spike are high with mtpa, with currently spintend MOSFET you can't run mtpa on 20s or MOSFET will gone
[2025-08-09T18:04:26] 'lekrsu': I wonder if overmodulation with a factor of 1.15 can cause issues, I imagine it can
[2025-08-09T18:05:05] Paolo ⁭: I won't take any risk to try , just swap MOSFET if you use mtpa
[2025-08-09T18:05:19] 'lekrsu': Tried MTPA and it felt like a throttle delayed snail
[2025-08-09T18:06:12] 'lekrsu': Didn't feel like checking why it did, didn't want it either way

[2025-08-09T22:19:08] Paolo ⁭: I don't know, but in this type of scam they give you a fake track code of other people's package. So when the track shows "delivered" and you didn't received nothing, you have to dispute immediately

[2025-08-10T02:15:04] Noname: Its a zero sr/f
[2025-08-10T02:15:19] Jason: mmm
[2025-08-10T02:16:09] Noname: Ok need a motorcycle for longer trips. The Emoped is good for 100-130 miles and then I dont Wana sit around
[2025-08-10T02:16:22] Jason: I also dont wanna sit around
[2025-08-10T02:16:29] Jason: charging for 1h
[2025-08-10T02:16:38] Jason: every 40~70km
[2025-08-10T02:17:15] Jason: and the problem is when I go 40s there's no easy way to add bunch of range easily
[2025-08-10T02:17:27] Jason: need to build another pack😇
[2025-08-10T02:17:58] Jason: maybe i should stay at 30s but I went top far already
[2025-08-10T02:18:26] Matthew: Wtf
[2025-08-10T02:20:10] Matthew: It ran down the road for around 3 miles and was fine. I accelerate hard and it cut out and now its broken...
[2025-08-10T02:20:53] Matthew: 16s 180amps battery and 180amps phase
[2025-08-10T02:21:08] Matthew: Yume y11 motor
[2025-08-10T02:26:24] Matthew: For PayPal, if others are interested in something you have for sale on fb marketplace. If they say they want to only do PayPal and no other type transaction, are they looking to scam?
[2025-08-10T02:26:57] Matthew: With 30s do you get good range?
[2025-08-10T02:28:55] Jason: I want speeeeed
[2025-08-10T02:29:13] Jason: and yes I still get good range when going slow
[2025-08-10T02:31:47] Matthew: Nice
[2025-08-10T02:31:56] Matthew: What motor do you use?
[2025-08-10T02:34:07] Noname: This is what controller?
[2025-08-10T02:35:24] Noname: 2hr 45min charging today. Also 276 miles so I did go far
[2025-08-10T02:37:26] Jason: damn
[2025-08-10T02:37:37] Jason: at least you got more charging to drive ratio
[2025-08-10T02:38:00] Jason: I need to push at like 25a charging to go somewhat far relatively quick
[2025-08-10T02:42:36] Matthew: 85250
[2025-08-10T02:44:18] Matthew: The vesc im confident is fine. The motor, this is the 2nd motor to do same shit under acceleration. Acceleration is strong then cut out then junk. Cant even do a setup on the motor either
[2025-08-10T02:45:08] Matthew: Throw 300amps at a lonnyo motor and it doesn't give a fuck
[2025-08-10T03:36:09] Noname: Oh fried the motor well that's not fun

[2025-08-10T03:43:12] Jason: I wanted to go fast but batt kept hot
[2025-08-10T03:43:16] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-08-10T03:43:20] Noname: 160km is about my limit with standing
[2025-08-10T03:43:26] Jason: mmmh
[2025-08-10T03:43:31] Noname: My motor gets hot
[2025-08-10T03:43:42] Noname: Pos

[2025-08-10T03:51:20] Matthew: I suppose that's what I did. Guess yume single motor and heavy me and scooter was just too much. I honestly didnt think the motor would have fried at 180amps
[2025-08-10T03:52:06] Matthew: I haven't actually ran 300amps on my lonnyo motors but these other guys running 37kw
[2025-08-10T04:10:19] Noname: 🔫 pew pew

[2025-08-10T17:47:11] Nobrrr: n009n10t ≠ hsbl009n10 Or is it just another name?
[2025-08-10T17:50:16] Paolo ⁭: Hsbl009n10 is the technical part number, n009n10t is what you find printed on the MOSFET

[2025-08-10T19:43:42] haku: hey have you tried anodizing aluminum before? i want black heatsinks
[2025-08-10T20:08:18] skrtt: Check this video
[2025-08-10T20:08:54] haku: yea i watch it. needs lots of chemicals
[2025-08-10T20:09:15] skrtt: Basicly just clean it good. Put on a sulfuric acid for 15 min. Rinse it. Sulfuric acid again with current. And then add colour
[2025-08-10T20:09:15] skrtt: No
[2025-08-10T20:09:34] haku: lye, dye, distilled water and powersupply
[2025-08-10T20:10:05] skrtt: What u expect?
[2025-08-10T20:10:21] skrtt: Just the heatsink and some prayers?
[2025-08-10T20:10:23] haku: spray
[2025-08-10T20:10:40] skrtt: U cant anodize with paint
[2025-08-10T20:10:46] haku: spray and pray
[2025-08-10T20:10:46] skrtt: 😐

[2025-08-10T20:11:24] skrtt: Worst decision ever after 2 days
[2025-08-10T20:11:26] haku: black anodized looks good on aluminum imo
[2025-08-10T20:11:30] Noname: Don't paint a heatsink
[2025-08-10T20:11:57] skrtt: Just wrap it
[2025-08-10T20:12:18] Noname: Your gonna seal in the heat
[2025-08-10T20:12:29] skrtt: And then wait for the heat to transform the wrap in another thing
[2025-08-10T20:12:38] skrtt: And what?
[2025-08-10T20:12:50] haku: even with anodize?
[2025-08-10T20:12:54] Noname: He lives in the desert

[2025-08-10T20:13:07] Noname: No with paint
[2025-08-10T20:13:19] haku: thats why i want anodize
[2025-08-10T20:13:38] Noname: You need a cover that makes a wind tunnel
[2025-08-10T20:13:40] skrtt: Is it possible to laser it?
[2025-08-10T20:13:58] Noname: I dont care lol

[2025-08-10T20:15:28] haku: no when i design mounts for dual 12fets. the heatsinks will be big. i want it to be not to be obvious
[2025-08-10T20:19:19] Noname: Make an aluminum box
[2025-08-10T20:19:46] Noname: Heatsinks poking out are for the gays

[2025-08-11T00:00:34] William the Second Educk: Hello, I'm basically finished building an MP2 vesc. However, it gives an error code when I try it out, and when I connect a battery, there's a short circuit between two phases. Does anyone know what I should do?
[2025-08-11T00:07:57] skrtt: Is that icecream in a cup?
[2025-08-11T00:16:24] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: It's a bit blown up
[2025-08-11T00:18:44] Matthew: Lmaoooo! My scooter with big 13x5 tire aired down to 20psi and scooter weight around 150lbs. And I weigh ~200lbs with my gear on. My 85250 vesc is fine. This is same results on a 2nd motor. I was figuring id at least get similar results i have had with vsett 10 motors. I was running 10.3kw on single vsett motor with statorade on 18s. I ended up going dual because crusing 40mph the motor would get hot.
[2025-08-11T00:38:19] Nobrrr: Pill is wrong on there
[2025-08-11T00:38:41] Nobrrr: Rotate 180° 😭🙏🏽

[2025-08-11T00:53:20] Jason: I think uhh
[2025-08-11T00:53:31] Jason: smth close to capacitor decided to bye bye
[2025-08-11T00:53:34] Jason: and short
[2025-08-11T00:53:45] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Probably cut off

[2025-08-11T00:58:10] Jason: poor 6fet
[2025-08-11T00:58:41] Jason: but i though mosfets would give up earlier and get decapitated
[2025-08-11T00:58:47] Jason: than smth else
[2025-08-11T01:05:39] William the Second Educk: Naahhh😂 i really hope nothing is broken

[2025-08-11T01:56:51] Matthew: I have regen brakes adc2 2 brake handles
[2025-08-11T01:58:04] Arsenus Pro🇺🇦: Change lisp or reset all settings(do again)
[2025-08-11T01:58:09] Matthew: I used some compressed air or air duster and flicked the throttle lever for just in case dust or something is causing issues
[2025-08-11T01:58:36] Matthew: I guess I should have asked whats lisp?
[2025-08-11T02:03:06] Matthew: 85150?
[2025-08-11T02:16:56] Star / Delta Master: Its working now, after doing setup procedere again 👍
[2025-08-11T02:20:21] Eduuuuuuuuu: any way to make the motors sound the same as the dualtron?

[2025-08-11T05:13:29] Jason: that cant protect properly in a crash now
[2025-08-11T05:14:50] haku: is the foam cracked?
[2025-08-11T05:14:56] Jason: yes
[2025-08-11T05:15:07] Jason: tbh even if its not cracked it should be replaced

[2025-08-11T13:07:59] Dualtron Achilleus: i guess its same as standard
[2025-08-11T14:38:34] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I've been thinking about this for a few days because my rear motor makes a little noise, not much but a little, so I understand that it could be from there my rear motor temperature problems, I will try to play with the resistance in inductance
[2025-08-11T14:39:58] Shlomozero10🇮🇱: Was told there is a 90h version for one of these
[2025-08-11T14:48:02] Dualtron Achilleus: Possible

[2025-08-11T17:11:48] Jason: LMAOO
[2025-08-11T18:16:44] Face de Pin Sucé: Capacitors legs couldn't handle the amount of current
[2025-08-11T18:17:03] Jason: <sticker>
[2025-08-11T18:19:33] Paolo ⁭: That's the effect not the cause, bms probably cutted while field weakening was running and crazy amount of reverse current come back
[2025-08-11T18:38:16] Massimo: Hi everyone! A question... I own a scooter with a 20S4P battery, LG M50LT cells, and a VESC 75100 (soon to be a 75200 Pro) with 90A max motor current and 50A max battery current. I can only reach 57km/h. The motor is a 500W monorim. 😮‍💨😮‍💨... Is the problem with the motor or do I not have enough power to reach higher speeds? Thanks.

[2025-08-11T20:22:26] IMWurden: change the motor
[2025-08-11T20:22:48] IMWurden: you could burn It with those amps

[2025-08-12T19:56:33] haku: need draggy.
[2025-08-12T19:57:13] skrtt: Only way to go if they wanna claim something
[2025-08-12T19:58:11] haku: this is powdercoat or car paint?
[2025-08-12T19:58:21] haku: this is well done
[2025-08-12T19:59:14] haku: i need to make a tiktok and insta. and claim my clout. its long overdue
[2025-08-12T19:59:27] skrtt: Red on its one of the slickest paints ive seen. That and one from racing boy that have t3 and nami
[2025-08-12T19:59:42] Arnau Martinez Casals: Car paint
[2025-08-12T19:59:56] Arnau Martinez Casals: Mine is Mitsubishi color code
[2025-08-12T20:00:03] Arnau Martinez Casals: The white
[2025-08-12T20:00:12] haku: the red is nice. its like chrome red
[2025-08-12T20:03:17] Paolo ⁭: Well he would need 65kw continuos power to get that performance by physic calculation in the best conditions, without considering the bad grip of the tire . No engine can support that power actually :(
[2025-08-12T20:06:13] skrtt: Whats the limit of these engines? 25kw each more or less? And even if scooter have 65kw aceleration will not go up cuz of small tire (size) and low weight. Thats what i think
[2025-08-12T20:10:24] Arnau Martinez Casals: You have to see his burned 100h lol
[2025-08-12T20:10:30] Arnau Martinez Casals: 🥵🤣
[2025-08-12T20:12:10] Paolo ⁭: 100h has same current limit as 70h
[2025-08-12T20:12:36] Arnau Martinez Casals: Yes and more heat dissipation
[2025-08-12T20:12:52] Arnau Martinez Casals: Im saying burned not abs
[2025-08-12T20:14:00] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes 70h 33x2 22s 11p
[2025-08-12T20:17:09] Paolo ⁭: 20kw each is already too much and you are working near 60% or less of efficiency
[2025-08-12T20:17:54] Arnau Martinez Casals: Is enough to burn it
[2025-08-12T20:18:05] Arnau Martinez Casals: Depends on track
[2025-08-12T20:19:00] Arnau Martinez Casals: With 70h, controller is cutting after 3 accelerations with 90/100 its cooler (it heats up too)
[2025-08-12T20:21:37] Paolo ⁭: Kelly heats more
[2025-08-12T20:25:11] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: The GPS signal has been lost, that's why it won't let me set it.
[2025-08-12T21:44:53] Face de Pin Sucé: Doesn't seem very fast, but je claims 0-100 2.5s 😂
[2025-08-12T21:45:25] Face de Pin Sucé: I bet he doesn't do better than 4.5s 0-100 and top speed is like 120kmh
[2025-08-12T21:47:29] Face de Pin Sucé: Burning a motor says a lot about how it's badly used and inefficient
[2025-08-12T21:48:54] Arnau Martinez Casals: Burned at track, at albaida smell toasted yours motors too
[2025-08-12T21:51:57] Arnau Martinez Casals: It doesnt care how inefficient is it, if he races and achieves win…
[2025-08-12T22:21:04] Marius: 2.5 😂😂
[2025-08-12T22:21:10] Marius: Is a joke right
[2025-08-12T22:21:40] Marius: Glued tires to the road ?
[2025-08-12T22:23:25] skrtt: Maybe he make 2,5s but the scooter was in the trunk of tesla
[2025-08-12T22:23:34] Marius: Is this legal where u are?
[2025-08-12T22:24:13] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: not at all

[2025-08-12T23:15:42] IMWurden: Hi guys, I'm having a problem with my steering damper on my scooter. When I turn the handlebars, I have to turn the steering a few millimeters before the damper becomes stiff, but that's enough to cause me a death wobble at high speed. Is there a way to eliminate this dead zone in the steering damper? What if I replace it with a better one?

Is there a way to eliminate this dead zone in the steering damper? What if I replace it?
[2025-08-12T23:45:17] Matthew: Is the spintend 100/100 capable of 150amps phase 90amps battery 16s and not worry about it frying itself? Temps haven't been higher than 62°c for me when ive pushed it hard 16s 130amps phase
[2025-08-12T23:46:34] Matthew: Are those scooters really good for HIGH power and racing?
[2025-08-12T23:59:49] Unknown: I mean everybode uses them so idk
[2025-08-12T23:59:55] Unknown: speaks for itself kinda
[2025-08-13T00:28:15] Matthew: The only way to have a proper damper working is expensive dampers. Youre better off getting a wide handlebar. And if you have to have a damper the ones worth buying are around $400usd.
[2025-08-13T00:29:19] Matthew: Yeah, was just curious as random people will want to ask about building something and I honestly dont have frames to suggest other than g30
[2025-08-13T00:30:23] Unknown: Nami frame
[2025-08-13T00:49:09] Matthew: <photos/photo_25292@13-08-2025_00-49-09.jpg>
[2025-08-13T00:50:35] Face de Pin Sucé: No we didn't burn a motor at albaida
[2025-08-13T00:50:57] Matthew: Thats not necessarily the specific model you will need. Just posting for a quality damper. I used 3 different dampers of generic no name 10 inch dampers all did the same. @IMWurden no damper and wide handlebar works well.
[2025-08-13T00:50:59] Face de Pin Sucé: That's a bad way of seeing things
[2025-08-13T01:02:42] Arnau Martinez Casals: Nami and longThunder are best chasis in my opinion
[2025-08-13T01:27:36] Matthew: I used 2 small ones and this big one. They all did the same and got horrible dead zone.
[2025-08-13T01:34:50] skrtt: Dont say that only the 400$ is worth it.
[2025-08-13T01:35:04] skrtt: Better have 15$ one that dont have
[2025-08-13T01:35:23] skrtt: My scooter doesnt need it and i still have it
[2025-08-13T01:35:36] skrtt: But yeah they have a shitty deadzone
[2025-08-13T01:39:52] Matthew: Just randomly curious. How much power/range from full charge would have been depleted with this run
[2025-08-13T01:42:47] Matthew: The deadzone for me makes the damper pointless and inconsistent and it was more dangerous to me connected than off. I was seeing people selling high dollar used units for reasonable price.
[2025-08-13T01:43:54] skrtt: Deadzone doesnt make it useless
[2025-08-13T02:57:52] LiquorHole .: I need some tips or Pointers on what to change, ive been researching On how and what i need to make a 21.1kw build as for the most part I BELIEVE i have everything Down the only 2 things that Kinda Bug me is The wire temperatures and Controller temps
[2025-08-13T02:58:57] LiquorHole .: Rn Im not entirely sure if 6awg Wires with Qs8 V2 connectors can handle that discharge even though it would be for 10-15 seconds im the type of rider to be doing Aggressive riding more times then not
[2025-08-13T02:59:57] LiquorHole .: And the controllers As well since they would Be in the controller compartment on the stem that has Natural air flow I thought about adding heatsinks with built in fans if that would be enough
[2025-08-13T03:09:56] skrtt: What frame?
[2025-08-13T03:10:39] LiquorHole .: R8 from yisuntrek but geofought has a more raw photo of it
[2025-08-13T03:11:04] LiquorHole .: The battery also uses Catl Nmc cells so 20s1p
[2025-08-13T03:11:22] skrtt: Same bat as geofought then
[2025-08-13T03:11:25] LiquorHole .: I know that the peak discharge is 300a but the Constant is around 100-150a from what i can gather about it
[2025-08-13T03:11:42] LiquorHole .: Geofought get that scooter from yisuntrek but Essentially yes
[2025-08-13T03:12:00] skrtt: Just buy spinted 85250
[2025-08-13T03:12:14] skrtt: I think they use 60h yes?
[2025-08-13T03:12:15] LiquorHole .: Thats the controller i was buying
[2025-08-13T03:12:24] LiquorHole .: I bought Hm 70h motors
[2025-08-13T03:12:40] LiquorHole .: But i was going to upgrade to Lonnyo 70h from spintend as well
[2025-08-13T03:12:57] LiquorHole .: Cause theirs 2 other people with custom r8 and both did a top speed of 78-79mph gps
[2025-08-13T03:13:10] LiquorHole .: Yeeb yam cinema and a random facebook user on fardriver controllers
[2025-08-13T03:13:14] skrtt: Ffs is you my boy
[2025-08-13T03:13:34] skrtt: Did u buy another frame??
[2025-08-13T03:13:45] LiquorHole .: Yeeb yam has the stock 80ah battery just ant bms so ik it can handle some power, sadly he wont disclose how much power he uses
[2025-08-13T03:13:53] LiquorHole .: Not yet
[2025-08-13T03:13:56] LiquorHole .: In September
[2025-08-13T03:14:07] LiquorHole .: Im getting it from geofought cause they got 10 day shipping
[2025-08-13T03:14:38] skrtt: Nice. Since u already have hm try them first before thinking on changing
[2025-08-13T03:15:19] LiquorHole .: They heat up to fast
[2025-08-13T03:16:26] skrtt: Hmmm
[2025-08-13T03:16:49] skrtt: @Bradhaku do u have 70h to sell?
[2025-08-13T03:17:19] LiquorHole .: I wasn’t planning on selling them because they aren’t damaged at all
[2025-08-13T03:17:55] LiquorHole .: Cause since i Want to buy those lonnyo motors that will make me have 3 motors cause yisuntrek sent me Torque winded motors they want me to test out
[2025-08-13T03:18:01] LiquorHole .: They asked before the crash
[2025-08-13T03:18:14] LiquorHole .: <photos/photo_25294@13-08-2025_03-18-14.jpg>

[2025-08-13T03:23:02] haku: i want to keep 70h 33x2 just incase i mount it on a peak g30 frame one day
[2025-08-13T03:25:37] LiquorHole .: Is a 7 inch rim
[2025-08-13T03:25:48] LiquorHole .: But I won’t be using it any time soon
[2025-08-13T03:26:02] LiquorHole .: It has More acceleration then the hm motors but Less speed
[2025-08-13T03:26:02] skrtt: They have little cables
[2025-08-13T03:26:29] haku: are you in US
[2025-08-13T03:26:32] LiquorHole .: Both hm and whatever motors those are have 5.5mm bullet connection the wires themselves look like 12awg possibly
[2025-08-13T03:26:35] LiquorHole .: Yup
[2025-08-13T03:27:24] skrtt: Buy some 70 or 75 lonnyo with thick cables 22x3 or 33x2 depending on your preference. Put that on a dual 85250 setup and u will be smoking haku
[2025-08-13T03:28:18] LiquorHole .: 70h is the biggest The r8 frame can do 75h is to wide, The wires are 10mm so theyre thick and spintend said they can install the Bullet connection AND qs8 connection if i Buy it from the website along with it
[2025-08-13T03:28:20] haku: my balls shrunken these days. spain boys put me to shame
[2025-08-13T03:28:54] LiquorHole .: Im looking for speed rn so im getting those 33x2 winding
[2025-08-13T03:29:12] LiquorHole .: They said the kv is 43 but from rage mechanics estimate their kv is 50
[2025-08-13T03:29:24] LiquorHole .: But cost a shit ton more
[2025-08-13T03:29:28] haku: wich state you from?
[2025-08-13T03:29:33] LiquorHole .: Jersey
[2025-08-13T03:29:45] skrtt: Check rfp page. To see the opening of their motors
[2025-08-13T03:30:07] skrtt: I think 70 and 75 have the same body
[2025-08-13T03:30:11] LiquorHole .: The opening needa be 150mm or less so anything past 70h wont fit
[2025-08-13T03:30:16] skrtt: Only 80h is different
[2025-08-13T03:30:20] LiquorHole .: Everywhere i checked 75h was 171mm
[2025-08-13T03:30:21] skrtt: Jus check bro
[2025-08-13T03:30:27] LiquorHole .: Alr hang on
[2025-08-13T03:30:28] haku: 70h is 143 i think
[2025-08-13T03:30:52] haku: but you can get custom axles like yamals
[2025-08-13T03:31:38] skrtt: Yeah 75h is 155mm
[2025-08-13T03:31:49] skrtt: Not for that frame
[2025-08-13T03:31:50] LiquorHole .: Id need to make custom rear swing arms and Custom Fork mounts for that and plus dont the 75h and bigger have lower kv then the 60-70h motors?
[2025-08-13T03:32:04] LiquorHole .: Or that depends on who sells
[2025-08-13T03:33:11] skrtt: Maybe rear u can put 70h and try to make costum cnc for the front forks
[2025-08-13T03:33:14] skrtt: Ive seen it done
[2025-08-13T03:34:20] LiquorHole .: Either way from the rfp Page it says the 70h motor got more kv then the 75h
[2025-08-13T03:34:29] LiquorHole .: And for my build i want more kv lol
[2025-08-13T03:34:37] LiquorHole .: So the 70h will do
[2025-08-13T03:35:06] LiquorHole .: <photos/photo_25295@13-08-2025_03-35-06.jpg>
[2025-08-13T03:35:47] LiquorHole .: The only thing i wonder is how Rage’s lonnyo motor has a 50 kv
[2025-08-13T03:36:13] LiquorHole .: <photos/photo_25296@13-08-2025_03-36-13.jpg>

[2025-08-13T11:58:24] Paolo ⁭: Not really, you can do for 2000€ budget , setup that kills 70% of riders
[2025-08-13T11:58:37] Paolo ⁭: Of course you have to do everything by yourself
[2025-08-13T11:58:53] Jason: rest 30%, hmmm

[2025-08-13T12:27:44] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: When you have a budget of 2000 you won't be able to choose from 10000 and you'll be at the back of the pack. I've been in the world of competition for a few years or do you think that all GP motorcycles are worth the same money or some part costs the same money from a Ducati to a Honda? I don't think you're joking because you know it's like that 🤣🤣🤣🤣
[2025-08-13T12:27:55] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes
[2025-08-13T12:29:08] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: But it's not all about driving. We can't give a driver an ice cream cart and tell him you have to win. 🥇 🤣
[2025-08-13T12:30:08] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: of course That's when you realize that you were no good no matter how much money we have.

[2025-08-15T01:48:57] Matthew: I am just curious for what they cost. I still intend on grinding the rail and getting the other bad unit out
[2025-08-15T01:49:55] Matthew: I like the 85150 a lot.
[2025-08-15T01:50:08] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes it's 50KW haha but it's quite complicated to reach that power
[2025-08-15T01:50:24] Face de Pin Sucé: 40-42KW is "quite easy" when you drive fast
[2025-08-15T01:56:30] Matthew: I haven't done anything yet.

[2025-08-15T11:39:31] Paolo ⁭: They are almost the same , but I would stick to huashuo as they are more tested and more reputable
[2025-08-15T11:40:07] Paolo ⁭: I wouldn't risk for so small difference
[2025-08-15T11:41:57] Nobrrr: And Rds on isn’t everything right?

[2025-08-15T22:30:27] Marius: Never heard of that
[2025-08-15T22:30:38] Marius: Ig its higher kv than 33x2?
[2025-08-15T22:30:49] Dualtron Achilleus: Cuz its 40magnets i guess
[2025-08-15T22:31:00] Dualtron Achilleus: Its 25kv only
[2025-08-15T22:31:14] Marius: Well 90h and big stator
[2025-08-15T22:31:31] AG.racing: ah yes the kv is small
[2025-08-15T22:31:44] Dualtron Achilleus: But lot mor torque than 110mm classical lonnyo
[2025-08-15T22:31:48] AG.racing: What is the difference with 40 magnets?
[2025-08-15T22:32:35] AG.racing: more torque than a basic 110H 11" 33×2 motor?
[2025-08-15T22:32:50] AG.racing: but maybe less max speed no?
[2025-08-15T22:33:05] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah cue stator bigger so more leverage from magnet
[2025-08-15T22:33:28] Dualtron Achilleus: Top speed slow yeah cuz 25kv
[2025-08-15T22:33:41] Dualtron Achilleus: Bit still faster that 75h 22*3 that is 23,5kv
[2025-08-15T22:34:10] Dualtron Achilleus: Idk that how ite made
[2025-08-15T22:34:20] AG.racing: How much kv does the 90h 33×2 basic motor have?

[2025-08-15T22:57:50] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: The GPS doesn't work very well inside the long tunnel.
[2025-08-15T22:59:54] haku: these are adults here. not german children @NewTurtle7815
[2025-08-15T23:00:04] haku: this is the balls to walls channel

[2025-08-16T00:03:11] Paolo ⁭: Make 30s setup
[2025-08-16T00:12:21] Dualtron Achilleus: To reach 200kph?😅😂
[2025-08-16T00:13:03] Dualtron Achilleus: More like 170 but that too muchh
[2025-08-16T00:15:11] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: When you go 150 you say, oh my god, I have problems.
[2025-08-16T00:17:12] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah just go on motorcycle if we want to go 200
[2025-08-16T00:17:33] Dualtron Achilleus: 150 is already crazy
[2025-08-16T00:18:40] AG.racing: Yes 🤯🤣
[2025-08-16T00:21:57] Marius: To not use fw
[2025-08-16T00:22:46] Marius: U feel like those speeds on Such low kv and 21s must be quite inefficient
[2025-08-16T00:27:58] Paolo ⁭: With 20s it does barely 100, with 30s maybe you can do 140
[2025-08-16T00:28:23] Paolo ⁭: How did you calculated 200 lol
[2025-08-16T00:39:15] haku: when i make my youtube. i will shill to thr fullest. pay me i will shill for whoever. you feel me dawgs. best scooter on the planet shill https://youtube.com/shorts/q5G9h-HtVTM?si=uIYjKe1g6TXlckoB

[2025-08-16T01:23:41] Rose: Hey there Imran, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2025-08-16T04:24:58] haku: is that legit enchanted fets?
[2025-08-16T04:25:13] Jason: idk looks fake
[2025-08-16T04:25:17] haku: i might do this 120v upgrades
[2025-08-16T04:25:18] Jason: completely bogus rating
[2025-08-16T04:25:23] haku: i see
[2025-08-16T04:25:42] Jason: or maybe they forgot some words after
[2025-08-16T04:25:55] Jason: like pulsed
[2025-08-16T04:26:17] haku: 1 sec burst maybe
[2025-08-16T06:01:36] haku: as a worldwide connoisseur of diabetes. what are we having? swiss or japanese?

[2025-08-16T10:28:32] Paolo ⁭: I'm in love with them ❤️
[2025-08-16T10:29:18] Jason: mmm
[2025-08-16T10:29:41] Paolo ⁭: They are very stable on 3shul
[2025-08-16T10:30:09] Jason: do they have tolt mosfets btw
[2025-08-16T10:30:43] Paolo ⁭: Only magnachip make them, but 80v only
[2025-08-16T10:30:54] Jason: f
[2025-08-16T10:31:38] Paolo ⁭: If I got enough money I can ask them to make it tolt XD
[2025-08-16T10:36:00] Paolo ⁭: You can use this
[2025-08-16T11:06:09] Dualtron Achilleus: I calculaded going downhill😂
[2025-08-16T11:06:37] Dualtron Achilleus: G300 340phase on video
[2025-08-16T11:08:21] Jason: oma gawd
[2025-08-16T11:08:25] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah maybe, my goal is just 0-100 draggy, i dont care of going 160 on a standing scooter
[2025-08-16T11:08:45] Jason: its gonna be perfect for phase shunt or current transducer
[2025-08-16T11:09:04] Jason: low or high side shunt doesnt seem reasonable for those packages
[2025-08-16T11:09:41] Paolo ⁭: Unfortunately they are not good for high frequency switch
[2025-08-16T11:10:01] Paolo ⁭: But you can make a 1000a BMS with only 2 of these fet maybe haha
[2025-08-16T11:10:06] Jason: yeah lmao
[2025-08-16T11:10:18] Jason: Hella great for bms
[2025-08-16T11:13:08] Paolo ⁭: I mean, the size is same of 4 toll MOSFET , so no advantage in the reality. But they have cooling surface on top , that's good
[2025-08-16T11:20:52] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I have 380 phase in g300
[2025-08-16T11:21:54] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Last night we made some adjustments, it seems to be going better, this afternoon I will try again.
[2025-08-16T11:22:40] Dualtron Achilleus: Good it work better?
[2025-08-16T11:23:00] Dualtron Achilleus: I was running 340here but i have also 400 phase mode
[2025-08-16T11:25:04] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If it seems that the ABS error is corrected or at least not as strong, I will try again this afternoon.
[2025-08-16T11:47:52] Yamal: We want to see
[2025-08-16T12:37:50] Dualtron Achilleus: I will put front motor and gooo
[2025-08-16T12:52:40] Felix: Does anyone know why vesc never saves these settings
[2025-08-16T13:08:17] Unknown: u have to write motor settings on the right side
[2025-08-16T13:20:08] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 🚀❤️
[2025-08-16T13:32:46] Dxniel: M⬇️
[2025-08-16T13:42:40] Felix: Okay I already did it It worked But not it won't take the throttle 😂
[2025-08-16T14:11:02] JPPL: Temp esc need to chill , summer time right?
[2025-08-16T14:14:07] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If it is summer in Spain now, the rear controller is the one that increases the temperature a lot.
[2025-08-16T14:14:30] Unknown: this is insane
[2025-08-16T14:16:16] Marius: Coulda been you if u had balls
[2025-08-16T14:16:45] Unknown: no
[2025-08-16T14:17:50] Marius: Aight
[2025-08-16T14:32:17] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes
[2025-08-16T14:32:21] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: ☺️
[2025-08-16T14:32:55] Unknown: dont have the balls
[2025-08-16T14:36:14] Marius: @Bradhaku wheres the Belt
[2025-08-16T15:03:55] Yamal: We really see a circuit e-scooter here
[2025-08-16T17:17:00] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: It's frankly a motorcycle
[2025-08-16T18:09:39] Yamal: Lots of people on vacation living the crazy life, right? Sleeping in the mornings ///waking up late, then swimming constantly in beaches, rivers, and lakes with hearty meals and cold drinks, and at night, beautiful nighttime routes in electric vehicles equipped with Vesc controllers!
[2025-08-16T18:10:20] Yamal: Wave boys, you are unbeatable 😄
[2025-08-16T18:19:39] Yamal: Who in this group uses vesc profiles?
[2025-08-16T18:22:37] Yamal: XD
[2025-08-16T18:23:24] Yamal: Best one ///23kmh .. I use permanently
[2025-08-16T18:23:36] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I haven't done it yet 🥲
[2025-08-16T18:23:47] Yamal: 23 kmh necessary man
[2025-08-16T18:24:05] Yamal: If they stop just turn off the scooter
[2025-08-16T18:24:18] Yamal: save life
[2025-08-16T18:25:01] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes, that's why I say I have to do it.
[2025-08-16T18:25:55] Yamal: If you have Fast and Furious mode on permanently, you better accelerate and never look back
[2025-08-16T18:27:26] Yamal: "seven routes" is a very fun profile for 14 kw and powerful routes, enough to cover more than enough kilometers.
[2025-08-16T18:28:31] Yamal: This name is in honor of "7 days /// 7 routes" The name comes from the movie 7 days and 7 nights xD
[2025-08-16T18:31:18] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Let's see if I can look at it. I always wanted to activate it.
[2025-08-16T18:34:17] Yamal: Hot Summer profile. I made it at the beginning of summer when temperatures reached 40°C practically every day. I used it at midday to get home. It's insurance against the accelerator and a mental insurance against the possibility of fireworks in a U-Box. I really push the limits of the controller, but the limits are safe. 😏
[2025-08-16T18:36:17] Yamal: 351km/h is the no-limits profile and it was set to that by default. I haven't baited it with a name yet! But it's clearly the extreme profile.
[2025-08-16T18:36:35] Yamal: Long time man
[2025-08-16T18:36:39] Yamal: How are you
[2025-08-16T18:40:57] Yamal: How is your bull scooter going?
[2025-08-16T18:41:33] Yamal: You will be conquering your country apart from some blondes :)
[2025-08-16T18:42:45] Yamal: To much torque xD
[2025-08-16T18:43:16] Yamal: What autonomy have you gotten from those 5p?
[2025-08-16T18:58:38] haku: as you can see my leige i am a loyal vesc subject unlike some other traitors. is there any updates on spintend new stuff?
[2025-08-16T18:59:20] haku: would putting enchanted mosfets help the 12 fets?
[2025-08-16T19:02:38] Noname: You never share
[2025-08-16T19:02:45] haku: treason doesnt go unpunished
[2025-08-16T19:03:00] haku: speaking of treason there he is

[2025-08-16T19:09:40] haku: indeed. even wtf is erpm shit
[2025-08-16T19:15:27] Noname: Electric revolutions per minutes
[2025-08-16T19:20:51] 'lekrsu': If you design some, add a brake mount to the flat sheet :D
[2025-08-16T19:21:15] 'lekrsu': G2's fortunately such an easy shape without bends needed
[2025-08-16T19:22:54] 'lekrsu': Russian's are replacing the oem bushings too, might be a good idea
[2025-08-16T19:23:12] 'lekrsu': That and G3 springs, done deal
[2025-08-16T19:23:36] 'lekrsu': Frick, G3's already got the G3 parts. Aah! :D
[2025-08-16T19:24:24] 'lekrsu': My G2 rear is a clonk machine on severe bumps
[2025-08-16T19:25:04] 'lekrsu': Surprised the motor hasn't rotated from the blue threadlock since before June
[2025-08-16T19:25:37] 'lekrsu': When it does it's a krr kraa krr kraa acceleration xD
[2025-08-16T19:25:59] 'lekrsu': O.o

[2025-08-16T20:05:13] Marius: Did u give William his spanking. I heard He joined the ranks of the puss army
[2025-08-16T20:05:40] haku: you know i have too look at those frames. they have a different style rear dropout. also the pro version is the longer one that might fit 20s. need to see it in person and do measurements
[2025-08-16T20:19:35] Noname: Idk if I'd trust those lil swimgarms

[2025-08-17T06:35:58] Yamal: So is broken your Esc ?,,, :(
[2025-08-17T06:37:26] Yamal: I have to check my bullet connectors for the front engine and so on... there are no apparent faults in the electronics, so I have to see where that strange sound is coming from.
[2025-08-17T06:38:03] LiquorHole .: Did you check the bullet connectors on the front engine?
[2025-08-17T06:38:09] Noname: I took one of of my vsett
[2025-08-17T06:38:40] Noname: But yeah it had a tantrum 😆
[2025-08-17T06:41:32] Yamal: Last night I looked over, but I'm going to open all the heat shrink to see if any are unsoldered a little or something.
[2025-08-17T06:43:45] Yamal: Sorry man, C700 would be a good option for a motorcycle, but expensive, also a Ubox with a Tolt MOSFET? If you had someone who could change them for you
[2025-08-17T06:45:18] Yamal: Unfortunately there are not too many powerful vesc types on the market, and the two American ones have fallen
[2025-08-17T06:52:19] Noname: They weren't American anyway
[2025-08-17T06:54:12] Yamal: ?
[2025-08-17T06:54:25] Noname: Lies

[2025-08-17T06:57:39] Noname: @Bradhaku boy or girl?
[2025-08-17T07:13:33] Yamal: I'm looking forward to starting new projects, the g2 project is something necessary, but I've been thinking for a while that if I had to do a project on a large "legal chassis" e-scooter I would probably do it with a long range, meaning that it would have a 60/70ah electronic battery, well insulated to be able to do off-road and dirt roads too, as in my area there are a lot of routes and they are cool, and nothing less than focusing it on the circuit or speed, but rather on peak torque and more battery to do longer routes, of course with good cells to be able to also do super fast charges if necessary.
[2025-08-17T07:16:26] haku: i can be whatever the internet wants me to be. you want white power haku? you want a nigga bang bang hard haku? you want a mexican hard working haku?

[2025-08-17T07:37:01] Yamal: I've been going to the country house in G2 for a while now, to avoid driving the Nami on dirt roads and to protect the electronics, since I don't have them well insulated.
[2025-08-17T07:37:20] Noname: I see the dirt
[2025-08-17T07:37:53] Noname: Yeah I might have blown mine up with road dirt not 100% sure though
[2025-08-17T07:37:55] Yamal: I'm happy I was able to plant potatoes and some autumn and winter fortifications before starting work.
[2025-08-17T07:38:15] haku: yams the humble 32kw farmer

[2025-08-17T07:40:06] Yamal: There is no electronic product equal in price and performance
[2025-08-17T07:40:43] haku: tell that to Noname hes a noob. he got a fardriver can you believe that yamal??

[2025-08-17T08:24:58] Paolo ⁭: Prepare 489€ hehe
[2025-08-17T08:25:24] LiquorHole .: Cause they wont let you buy the display by it self gotta buy the damn controller and display
[2025-08-17T08:25:29] LiquorHole .: That part is something i hate
[2025-08-17T08:25:43] LiquorHole .: But the display is So Nice and got some features i like 😭
[2025-08-17T08:25:49] Paolo ⁭: It's a very good display but the producing must be reviewed, too expensive
[2025-08-17T08:26:15] LiquorHole .: I might buy it anyway letter next year when My build is 100% done
[2025-08-17T08:26:21] haku: i think thier displays you can wifi since its racing
[2025-08-17T08:26:33] haku: im not sure how that works tbh
[2025-08-17T08:27:05] LiquorHole .: Yeah they got an app, But is More like a regular display you plug it into the controller and stuff then turn on the bluetooth the display has and stuff
[2025-08-17T08:27:08] LiquorHole .: Im assuming
[2025-08-17T08:27:49] haku: maybe. im not sure. but he said the rest of the team can see the telemetry

[2025-08-17T08:32:11] Jason: the code however...
[2025-08-17T08:32:17] Jason: hehe
[2025-08-17T08:32:26] Jason: make one by yourself
[2025-08-17T08:32:36] LiquorHole .: Software engineer over here
[2025-08-17T08:33:15] Jason: <photos/photo_25365@17-08-2025_08-33-15.jpg>
[2025-08-17T08:33:52] Jason: still wip
[2025-08-17T08:34:25] LiquorHole .: Cause i was gonna either use my phone as a display or buy that flipsky tft display if I couldnt or didn’t want the rage display
[2025-08-17T08:34:41] LiquorHole .: Shouldnt be bad, the flipsky display right?
[2025-08-17T08:35:16] Jason: idk
[2025-08-17T08:35:27] Jason: <photos/photo_25366@17-08-2025_08-35-27.jpg>
[2025-08-17T08:35:31] Jason: id just buy cyd
[2025-08-17T08:35:46] Jason: and just flash the firmware
[2025-08-17T08:36:04] Jason: https://github.com/NetworkDir/SimpleVescDisplay
[2025-08-17T08:38:23] haku: release the files dammit
[2025-08-17T08:38:41] Jason: not yet done
[2025-08-17T08:38:45] haku: open source like a true vesc lord
[2025-08-17T08:39:03] Jason: I havent even finished all features yet
[2025-08-17T08:39:12] haku: alright my bad
[2025-08-17T08:39:31] haku: i will not mooch off your success
[2025-08-17T08:39:54] haku: but i thats a badass display. size is perfect
[2025-08-17T08:53:38] Paolo ⁭: They actually struggle to make the hardware cheap I think
[2025-08-17T08:53:55] Paolo ⁭: You are not getting back engineering cost in 10 unit, that's logical
[2025-08-17T08:54:52] Jason: hmm wasn't the display pre-built except the case
[2025-08-17T08:55:15] Jason: <photos/photo_25367@17-08-2025_08-55-15.jpg>
[2025-08-17T08:56:09] Paolo ⁭: Because it's built in with the smart controller, it does have much capabilities
[2025-08-17T08:56:33] Paolo ⁭: Even the humidity sensor if I'm not wrong
[2025-08-17T08:56:44] Jason: mm
[2025-08-17T08:57:47] Paolo ⁭: so ... raw costs (PCB, components, glass, enclosure, cables, assembly ...) + enginering costs + VAT + company taxes ... + sales costs + margin we'll see, but I don't think it will be under 300€ ... yeh ... I know.
[2025-08-17T09:00:03] Jason: cant beat china easily
[2025-08-17T09:00:09] Jason: they just
[2025-08-17T09:00:21] Jason: cost is insane
[2025-08-17T09:00:42] Jason: labors, parts or anything
[2025-08-17T09:04:17] Paolo ⁭: I think 200€ is the right price
[2025-08-17T09:04:44] Paolo ⁭: If you sell 1000 and earning 50$ is better than selling 50 and earning 150 maybe
[2025-08-17T09:14:00] Rose: Hey there Баба-яга, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2025-08-17T13:52:11] LiquorHole .: Are those types of steering dampers better then traditional ones?

[2025-08-17T15:03:07] Yamal: In the end never mount ubox v2?
[2025-08-17T15:11:27] Yamal: Last night I was thinking, if you decide to activate an electric brake by surprise, give full throttle or whatever, I'm a dead man
[2025-08-17T15:20:01] Rose: Hey there Betty, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2025-08-17T17:12:50] IMWurden: oh, why a lot of Nami owner have It?
[2025-08-17T17:13:41] skrtt: Smaller stem better stability, better to lean and better to lean forward when accelerating
[2025-08-17T17:14:24] IMWurden: oh ok i understand
[2025-08-17T17:19:25] Noname: No that'll snap in half
[2025-08-17T17:30:27] Rose: Hey there Emilio, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-08-17T18:42:40] Face de Pin Sucé: It was designed by Ambrosini, then some did the same. Main problem, it is a full aluminium, not a tube, so it weight extremely high, 1.7Kg We make a titanium pole and it's 0.8Kg basically
[2025-08-17T18:45:01] Yamal: Anatoly stem
[2025-08-17T18:45:14] Face de Pin Sucé: Hahaha true
[2025-08-17T18:45:15] Yamal: But the look nice
[2025-08-17T18:45:18] Yamal: 😏
[2025-08-17T18:46:06] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_25369@17-08-2025_18-46-06.jpg>
[2025-08-17T18:49:17] Yamal: 🤐
[2025-08-17T18:54:26] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 😉
[2025-08-17T18:54:37] haku: stock
[2025-08-17T18:56:05] haku: what?
[2025-08-17T18:56:48] Face de Pin Sucé: <photos/photo_25370@17-08-2025_18-56-48.jpg>
[2025-08-17T18:56:54] Face de Pin Sucé: RM-X / RM-Light / Rion Thrust
[2025-08-17T18:57:33] skrtt: Wait really?? Its not a tube?
[2025-08-17T18:57:42] Face de Pin Sucé: Tronic 250 Rion Thrust
[2025-08-17T18:57:47] Face de Pin Sucé: No 😂
[2025-08-17T18:59:34] skrtt: Are hopetech better than beringer?
[2025-08-17T19:00:41] Face de Pin Sucé: No
[2025-08-17T19:01:16] Face de Pin Sucé: But Beringer price is too high compared to the performance difference in braking power honestly
[2025-08-17T19:01:41] skrtt: Why not have them on the faster scooter?
[2025-08-17T19:01:58] skrtt: Yeah 1 beringer = 4 hopetechs
[2025-08-17T19:02:14] Face de Pin Sucé: No haha, it's 999€ for the pair
[2025-08-17T19:02:34] skrtt: I thought just 1 piece not pair
[2025-08-17T19:02:39] Face de Pin Sucé: Because we don't need that braking power on the rear, and on front we were using Double Hope, now we using something different
[2025-08-17T19:03:00] Face de Pin Sucé: Another thing, Beringer is wider so you can't get it as close as Hope from the rim
[2025-08-17T19:06:10] skrtt: For back u basically need brakes with most modulation possible. Cuz almost all hydraulic brakes skid the rear tire
[2025-08-17T19:07:20] haku: this one has 33x2 70h
[2025-08-17T19:36:20] Yamal: RM LIGHT, base thunder ?
[2025-08-17T19:38:44] Rose: Hey there Samuel, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?

[2025-08-17T20:26:36] haku: any good
[2025-08-17T20:26:46] Yamal: Don’t know look good
[2025-08-17T20:28:13] Yamal: I got them at a motorcycle shop near my work that had forgotten them by chance. The bad thing is that the other one was Chinese, Feng Shuang or whatever it's called, but they're also well-known for mini-bikes, and the heel came with a defect.
[2025-08-17T20:29:29] Yamal: I really wanted to try both 90 wheels
[2025-08-17T20:29:34] skrtt: They are. Not as good as pmt tho. My friend have t41 rear and sava front
[2025-08-17T20:29:50] Yamal: Same me xD

[2025-08-17T20:30:17] skrtt: Probabily
[2025-08-17T20:30:32] Yamal: Ulip yes
[2025-08-17T20:30:35] Yamal: Sava no
[2025-08-17T20:30:49] Yamal: Amazing man
[2025-08-17T20:30:50] haku: i want the stardale 90 for my next build just to try pmt
[2025-08-17T20:31:05] Yamal: Look really nice
[2025-08-17T20:31:44] skrtt: Stradale good cuz they last but not as grippy as t41 or juniors. I really notice the diference
[2025-08-17T20:32:23] Yamal: It's really what I'm passionate about, circuit scooters, I can't help it
[2025-08-17T20:32:48] Yamal: Slick for 24/7 no good
[2025-08-17T20:33:05] skrtt: Same 😭

[2025-08-17T21:08:33] Yamal: I am in a very small city where large e-scooters are almost completely disappearing, it would be a very different thing if I were in Barcelona/Madrid/Valencia.
[2025-08-17T21:10:55] Yamal: The laws for e-scooters are also taking their toll. I am like the last Mohican in my land and I will resist until 2027. After that, it will be time to change the scooter// voltage // mosfet// but not the controllers
[2025-08-17T21:11:00] Yamal: :)
[2025-08-17T21:11:23] skrtt: I know. They saying that as your weight is mostly on rear u need it to be higher 🤓

[2025-08-17T23:20:17] LiquorHole .: Since your here, to buy your display i gotta also buy a controller with it right? Or I can just buy the display by itself 😏
[2025-08-17T23:20:29] Face de Pin Sucé: This is first and only prototype for now of RM-Series with 100% Rage Mechanics parts for frame
[2025-08-17T23:21:16] Face de Pin Sucé: For the rear I don't really care about the disc honestly, I put what I have in stock
[2025-08-17T23:21:37] Face de Pin Sucé: But for the front, only BrakeStuff (or Rage Mechanics ones coming)
[2025-08-17T23:22:06] Face de Pin Sucé: Yes you need to buy controller with it, but soon, display will be open to sales without controllers
[2025-08-17T23:22:08] skrtt: Why is the second scooter full of sonken parts 🤨

[2025-08-17T23:23:31] Dualtron Achilleus: What value should i put instead?
[2025-08-17T23:23:38] skrtt: .
[2025-08-17T23:25:19] Face de Pin Sucé: Ah this one is a customer scooter, we only did preparation for motor + controller + battery, display, brakes, he already had the frame But recently we removed the Sonken Swingarm because it's shit, took play by time, so we put our own swingarm and now it's fine haha
[2025-08-17T23:26:18] skrtt: U plan on selling swing arm and neck?
[2025-08-17T23:28:59] Face de Pin Sucé: I wanted to, but it's not in the plans for now
[2025-08-17T23:34:13] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah 3,3 v

[2025-08-18T00:18:09] Rose: Hey there Quentin, and welcome to Vesc / Scooter group! How are you?
[2025-08-18T00:19:11] skrtt: Guys i have a question. My friend conected shitsky 75200 but it says its 75300. Any problem with that?
[2025-08-18T00:39:59] Yamal: Can 22s fit in the long chassis for the DT Victor, the new one you're selling?
[2025-08-18T00:52:08] Face de Pin Sucé: Well, we fit 21S7P
[2025-08-18T00:52:17] Face de Pin Sucé: But 22S can fit if I remember correctly
[2025-08-18T01:11:42] skrtt: Buy a thunder cheap ass
[2025-08-18T01:11:45] skrtt: Eheheheh
[2025-08-18T01:13:13] skrtt: No im wrong. I think its cheaper to buy victor dgt and transform it into a thunder
[2025-08-18T01:14:11] skrtt: 240€ arms and 400€ for the front and back piece. I dont think the thunder is 640€ more expensive than the victor
[2025-08-18T03:29:50] ausias: ive seen the sava in 80€ Juniors aint cheaper???
[2025-08-18T05:29:57] Yamal: <photos/photo_25381@18-08-2025_05-29-57.jpg>
[2025-08-18T05:30:27] Yamal: 2=80?
[2025-08-18T05:41:34] Yamal: It is possible, I see it as good, once in a while, Victor front and rear supports, Thunder arms, long box 21 s 50 pl ubox with custom mosfet and 90 or 100h speed motors, 100x100 legal scooter, certified and approved by the DGT
[2025-08-18T05:47:06] Yamal: It's clear that Thunder 3 is the big goal! But who would pay €3,890 to remove the battery, motors, and controllers?
[2025-08-18T06:00:16] skrtt: How much for the victor?
[2025-08-18T06:02:03] skrtt: My point is that if u planning on buy extended deck either for victor or thunder is cheaper to just buy victor and put arms and deck holders from thunder
[2025-08-18T06:12:25] Yamal: The point is buy certificate victor
[2025-08-18T06:12:33] Yamal: Now second hand market
[2025-08-18T06:12:50] Yamal: 1500€/1600 €
[2025-08-18T06:13:12] Yamal: We see in one year how is the prices
[2025-08-18T06:16:05] skrtt: Thats fair
[2025-08-18T06:17:05] skrtt: Can even make some money back with selling all electronics
[2025-08-18T06:17:09] Yamal: The other option I have is to forget about the circuit a bit and simply mount 2 VESC controllers with 55/60/70 Ah batteries to make long and large routes.
[2025-08-18T06:18:12] skrtt: And keep 16s?
[2025-08-18T06:19:06] skrtt: Cuz i doubt that u can put 55ah at 20s
[2025-08-18T06:19:53] haku: 50pl
[2025-08-18T06:20:16] LiquorHole .: Those cells are Super steroids

[2025-08-18T06:26:10] LiquorHole .: Is a good battery honestly dont need to Buy/make a whole new battery
[2025-08-18T06:27:18] skrtt: Just change bms and u good to go

[2025-08-18T06:47:33] skrtt: Whats happening in my area is that people are upgrading those 60v generics frame to 72v used to ride at the same speeds
[2025-08-18T06:48:17] LiquorHole .: The frames are good on a budget depending on what frame it is
[2025-08-18T06:48:29] haku: more voltage is more efficient imo
[2025-08-18T06:48:43] haku: depending on riding style ofcourse

[2025-08-18T06:56:17] skrtt: Their marketing guy said 24s without regen but i doubt it
[2025-08-18T06:56:19] haku: you can always design a 3d printed mount then if you like it have it milled
[2025-08-18T06:56:24] skrtt: But less phase and bat amps
[2025-08-18T06:56:57] LiquorHole .: Was thinking about that but for a later time lol
[2025-08-18T06:57:08] LiquorHole .: Especially now since i gotta spend thousands on a frame
[2025-08-18T06:57:18] skrtt: That would look sick. 2 boxes on each side of the slimmer part of the stem
[2025-08-18T06:57:36] haku: nothing impossible nowadays with 3d printing
[2025-08-18T06:57:56] LiquorHole .: Wanted to like entirely redesign the front end, Like the Hooga daytona design kinda
[2025-08-18T06:58:07] haku: yea or one box with side to side vescs or god forbid far fars
[2025-08-18T06:58:45] LiquorHole .: Id just need to Learn how to design the Neck, And fork mounts
[2025-08-18T06:58:54] skrtt: Farfar is waterproof so fuck the box
[2025-08-18T06:59:17] skrtt: And do it how? U have cnc or laser?

[2025-08-18T06:59:58] LiquorHole .: Was gonna pay someone to do it
[2025-08-18T07:00:02] haku: yea.
[2025-08-18T07:01:15] skrtt: But u want a dual stem with c suspension?
[2025-08-18T07:02:13] LiquorHole .: No
[2025-08-18T07:02:15] haku: tbh im a fan of motorcycle style forks
[2025-08-18T07:02:25] LiquorHole .: How do I explain it kinda
[2025-08-18T07:02:40] haku: c suspension not too much
[2025-08-18T07:02:53] haku: it looks cool though
[2025-08-18T07:03:06] LiquorHole .: Think about the Hooga daytona if it was a Full fork setup
[2025-08-18T07:03:08] LiquorHole .: Basically
[2025-08-18T07:03:10] skrtt: I think mars gtr is the best cuz it have that 3rd suspension to eliminate the smaller vibrations
[2025-08-18T07:04:00] skrtt: So u want a nami with forks
[2025-08-18T07:04:50] skrtt: U want to change the neck/folding system? I wouldnt mess with that
[2025-08-18T07:04:51] haku: the racing boys got the c suspension dialed in. idk i think they use no suspension i think yea
[2025-08-18T07:05:17] LiquorHole .: No i was gonna remove that entirely 😂
[2025-08-18T07:05:23] LiquorHole .: Or have the forks fold
[2025-08-18T07:05:45] LiquorHole .: The folding system is already flawed out the box on my scooter
[2025-08-18T07:05:45] skrtt: No suspension on namis and dualtron suspension are the best for track
[2025-08-18T07:06:14] haku: dualtron super hard suspension
[2025-08-18T07:06:26] skrtt: Thats what im saying. U need to check the mounts and design a hole new thing
[2025-08-18T07:06:57] skrtt: Unfortunately yes to hard for shitty roads
[2025-08-18T07:07:16] LiquorHole .: The mounts for a New Neck should be easy, is The Geometry I need to figure out.
[2025-08-18T07:07:38] skrtt: Ive even seen a person here putting a bolt on those cartuches
[2025-08-18T07:07:40] haku: im used to no suspension haha
[2025-08-18T07:07:46] LiquorHole .: My main inspiration was basically like the vsett 11+ with a Controller Box on the stem basically
[2025-08-18T07:08:12] skrtt: U have nice roads there
[2025-08-18T07:08:27] haku: not the best but its not bad
[2025-08-18T07:09:32] haku: makes sense for racing guys though. eliminates wobbles and cornering stiffness
[2025-08-18T07:10:01] skrtt: Come to eu to experience this on 11” wheels
[2025-08-18T07:10:19] haku: beautiful cobblestone but dam
[2025-08-18T07:11:05] LiquorHole .: And then i wanted to redesign the kick plate as well, It basically doesn’t exist on my scooter, Wanted to make it Larger and more useable, along with Making it big enough house My rear brake light or Ig For me to custom make one then I could have a Prettier mud guard and a Cleaner look
[2025-08-18T07:11:06] skrtt: Apart from the cooblestone is the fact that the road is like this ~~~~~
[2025-08-18T07:11:13] skrtt: ~~
[2025-08-18T07:11:17] skrtt: wth
[2025-08-18T07:12:18] LiquorHole .: Basically want as little amount of visible screws as possible, a more functional design and also a Prettier design with equal stability lol

[2025-08-18T15:23:53] Yamal: I am delighted with my G2 Max, the bad thing is that it doesn't go over 25 km/h.
[2025-08-18T15:55:15] Dualtron Achilleus: Light is more acceleration in a way
[2025-08-18T16:23:25] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I'm going to change the rear engine for 100h. The 70 gets very hot. I returned home the day before yesterday due to engine problems. Let's hope we don't have any more temperature problems
[2025-08-18T16:28:09] Paolo ⁭: You will get much less top speed with 100h
[2025-08-18T16:33:54] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: In the front I will leave 70 but well the rear engine will push the front one to its maximum speed
[2025-08-18T16:34:53] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: My problem is the temperature of the rear engine. The front one works well and does not heat up more than 60/70 degrees.
[2025-08-18T16:38:09] Dualtron Achilleus: Take 2 and gift me one please🤣
[2025-08-18T16:38:36] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah 70h is small so 2023 like @Bradhaku say
[2025-08-18T16:39:24] Paolo ⁭: No haha it doesn't work like that, to keep the speed as the front engine you will need a lot of field weakening, and this will heat you engine even more
[2025-08-18T16:40:29] Paolo ⁭: It's normal for the engine to get hot in the summer , just make sure that it doesn't go over 110degrees
[2025-08-18T16:42:13] haku: whats the temps on your 70h?
[2025-08-18T16:44:04] haku: i cant keep up with the boys. i have 2023 tech.
[2025-08-18T16:44:27] Dualtron Achilleus: @AYO744 is your motor open?or ferofluid
[2025-08-18T16:44:41] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: The rear engine temperature sensor is broken. I check the temperature as before by putting my hand on it, but it's impossible to get close. You burn your hand in less than a second.
[2025-08-18T16:45:20] Dualtron Achilleus: You can also pee on your motor too cool it 🤣
[2025-08-18T16:45:39] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: closed
[2025-08-18T16:47:04] haku: 70h in 2023 $400 with rim. 2025 $700
[2025-08-18T16:47:19] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: The front doesn't heat up, I can put my hand on it for a long time, if I remember correctly, it doesn't reach 70 degrees.
[2025-08-18T16:47:28] haku: i wonder how much 100h is imported to US
[2025-08-18T16:47:56] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 100h x1
[2025-08-18T16:48:36] haku: what is axle size on those?
[2025-08-18T16:48:37] Dualtron Achilleus: Inflation
[2025-08-18T16:48:45] Dualtron Achilleus: 180
[2025-08-18T16:49:53] haku: when i ran 70h mine got up to 106c highway riding
[2025-08-18T16:49:58] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 180
[2025-08-18T16:50:16] Dualtron Achilleus: Where is you 70h now
[2025-08-18T16:50:28] haku: not used.
[2025-08-18T16:50:34] Dualtron Achilleus: I guess you sell it for a futur 130h
[2025-08-18T16:50:35] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: <photos/photo_25387@18-08-2025_16-50-35.jpg>
[2025-08-18T16:50:48] haku: but ill get it running in the near future
[2025-08-18T16:50:58] Dualtron Achilleus: Take 100h in 66*1 widing
[2025-08-18T16:51:04] Dualtron Achilleus: What frame
[2025-08-18T16:51:08] haku: thats 2026 tech
[2025-08-18T16:51:27] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: 100h33x2
[2025-08-18T16:52:22] Dualtron Achilleus: 66*1 so kv will match with your 70h
[2025-08-18T16:52:28] haku: wepoor frame. too dam heavy.
[2025-08-18T16:53:01] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Mmmm
[2025-08-18T16:53:33] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: If in the future we put 80/90/100 h what do we do 🧐🤣🤣
[2025-08-18T16:54:18] Paolo ⁭: Do you have traction control
[2025-08-18T16:55:20] haku: ill mount this 70h on a mini bmx frame peak g30 frame. i just need tabless cells and a skinny rim
[2025-08-18T16:55:27] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: Yes
[2025-08-18T16:56:23] Paolo ⁭: It heats more rear engine, it's better to set more max erpm difference, and manage better your weight
[2025-08-18T16:56:44] Dualtron Achilleus: You already have a bmx bro
[2025-08-18T16:57:14] Dualtron Achilleus: Build a dragster suron
[2025-08-18T16:57:22] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: understood, I'll go on a diet🤣 and increase rpm
[2025-08-18T16:57:52] haku: flies under the radar. cops dont give bat an eye. haha

[2025-08-18T17:02:12] Dualtron Achilleus: Its made for drag or 300lbs seatedscooter
[2025-08-18T17:02:17] haku: its cheaper than lonnyo.
[2025-08-18T17:02:27] Dualtron Achilleus: Yeah i see

[2025-08-18T17:02:56] Dualtron Achilleus: 12inch too much torque
[2025-08-18T17:03:49] Dualtron Achilleus: Plus bmx frame narrow no?
[2025-08-18T17:04:00] Dualtron Achilleus: So it will wheelie all day xd
[2025-08-18T17:04:25] Paolo ⁭: I mean, put your weight more possible on the front
[2025-08-18T17:16:18] 🇪🇸AYO#74🏁: I'll put a beer keg 🍺 in the front to compensate, I weigh 70/75kg
[2025-08-18T18:39:25] haku: can stretch or jank weld a swingarms
[2025-08-18T18:40:04] haku: there is something about bmx frames gives me nostalgia. small bikes
