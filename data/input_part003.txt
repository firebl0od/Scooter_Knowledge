[2022-08-16T14:30:26] Thierry: Yes its what I've done but I wanted to try detect and calculate but doesn't seem to work properly. Thanks
[2022-08-16T15:05:12] Artem Bulashev: Finally, last piece of a puzzle came in today - black screws üòú

[2022-08-16T15:05:23] Mirono escooters: Beautiful
[2022-08-16T15:05:29] Artem Bulashev: Shipping all100 pre orders this week
[2022-08-16T15:05:29] Mirono escooters: Even wire looks badass
[2022-08-16T15:06:34] Artem Bulashev: Man that is busy ass throttle internals ü§£ 7 wires are not easy to solder - doing manually by head engineer him self and testing every single one before shipping Top case clamps on the wire as cable retaintion üëå
[2022-08-16T15:07:04] Mirono escooters: Poor him
[2022-08-16T15:07:10] Mirono escooters: Hzad engineer? Spintend? :P
[2022-08-16T15:07:46] Artem Bulashev: The main electrical guy yeah
[2022-08-16T15:07:57] Artem Bulashev: Not one of employees that usually assemble pcb
[2022-08-16T15:17:00] Face de Pin Suc√©: 100 preorders ?
[2022-08-16T15:21:44] Jan: yeah üéâ
[2022-08-16T15:35:38] Artem Bulashev: Without wholesales to distributors yeah
[2022-08-16T15:36:37] Artem Bulashev: Over all over 500 units ordered
[2022-08-16T15:48:51] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2022-08-16T15:50:53] Luis Magalhaes: Shit üëÄ
[2022-08-16T15:51:13] Luis Magalhaes: Very nice üòÅ i will buy one latter too üòÅ
[2022-08-16T17:10:32] Artem Bulashev: Will be on retail in eu soon üëå
[2022-08-16T17:15:57] Mirono escooters: Jaj
[2022-08-16T19:13:34] Luis Magalhaes: Nice üòÅ
[2022-08-16T21:40:24] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I love both combos
[2022-08-16T21:41:05] Artem Bulashev: Will get two 100v copper single UBOX and 2 throttles this week or Monday
[2022-08-16T21:41:39] Artem Bulashev: Will share photos and videos and make YouTube tutorial on ‚Äúfirst set up guide‚Äù
[2022-08-16T21:41:50] Artem Bulashev: Yeah all ship this week
[2022-08-16T21:42:17] Artem Bulashev: Busy times if you didn‚Äôt specify color, they will be emailing you
[2022-08-16T21:42:32] Artem Bulashev: Which one you got ?
[2022-08-16T21:43:07] Artem Bulashev: That watch out for email they will ask you
[2022-08-16T21:43:45] Artem Bulashev: Those above Yeah red accents or naked accents
[2022-08-16T21:44:06] Artem Bulashev: Silver one is uncoated pure cnc aluminum :)
[2022-08-16T21:44:38] Artem Bulashev: I really wonder how well those will do Glad to see they spent more money and paid second time to get copper instead of brass
[2022-08-16T21:47:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: Copper is easy to get oxide :/
[2022-08-16T21:48:11] Mirono escooters: I don't get why it's exposed tho
[2022-08-16T21:48:32] Mirono escooters: Weird design choices i keep saying it. Pass for me
[2022-08-16T22:08:26] Konstantin: 30ah, vtc6, 15s10p ;)
[2022-08-16T22:08:35] Mirono escooters: Gg
[2022-08-16T22:18:28] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: ~1.7kWh approximately...
[2022-08-16T23:50:12] Unknown: <photos/photo_5683@16-08-2022_23-50-12.jpg>
[2022-08-16T23:50:15] Unknown: m365 original bms broke down i will buy new bms will i have any problem if i buy this product
[2022-08-16T23:53:27] Mirono escooters: Wrong group No bms communication
[2022-08-16T23:53:37] Mirono escooters: Find out why it "broke down"
[2022-08-17T00:00:00] Artem Bulashev: Also easy to polish, it should not oxide unless you get water inside deck, which should not happen in first place.
[2022-08-17T00:00:50] Artem Bulashev: Copper oxides 25 microns per year on open air, so with thermal past / pad it won‚Äôt oxidize where it matters
[2022-08-17T00:01:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is so easy to oxide
[2022-08-17T00:01:44] Mirono escooters: -_-
[2022-08-17T00:01:56] Artem Bulashev: This cooling should offset higher IR of 100v fets (those are best 100v fets already), thus you should be able to pump same phase and battery amp limit settings as on 75100 dual I suspect
[2022-08-17T00:02:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: it is enough to touch it with a sweaty hand
[2022-08-17T00:02:24] Mirono escooters: Since sweat is salty, thats quite logical
[2022-08-17T00:02:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: copper oxidizes only on the surface, but if the surface is oxidized the heat transfer will be much worse
[2022-08-17T00:02:44] Artem Bulashev: Yeap also it doesn‚Äôt evaporate as easy as water
[2022-08-17T00:02:52] Artem Bulashev: So it is a lot worse than water
[2022-08-17T00:03:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: So at all aluminium is better, cheaper, no oxide , and more light
[2022-08-17T00:03:37] Artem Bulashev: Yeah so place into deck with heat paste or pad and it won‚Äôt be exposed to almost any air where it matters
[2022-08-17T00:03:57] Artem Bulashev: Heat transfer is twice better if I‚Äôm not mistaken
[2022-08-17T00:04:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: And even as I always told, copper touch resin no mos metal part üòÇ so you can use also silver but will be the same lol
[2022-08-17T00:04:12] Artem Bulashev: Also heat capacity
[2022-08-17T00:04:36] Artem Bulashev: True that
[2022-08-17T00:04:39] Unknown: <photos/photo_5684@17-08-2022_00-04-39.jpg>
[2022-08-17T00:04:57] Artem Bulashev: One step at a time :)
[2022-08-17T00:05:02] Unknown: This is the reason for the breakdown
[2022-08-17T00:05:07] Mirono escooters: Id prefer alu bottom same its wekrd design but thats me
[2022-08-17T00:05:08] Mirono escooters: Weird design choices nr 69
[2022-08-17T00:05:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, but if you haven‚Äôt heat contact with them, so no sense
[2022-08-17T00:05:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you have flipsky alu pcb, then make sense
[2022-08-17T00:05:39] Artem Bulashev: I hope I will co design next vesc that will be targeted for escooters specifically - ideally a line up with multiple power levels
[2022-08-17T00:06:06] Artem Bulashev: They reblooking into alum pcb yeah
[2022-08-17T00:07:15] Artem Bulashev: Agree, resin doesn‚Äôt take heat away well at all But we should expect 75100 dual level of amps settings I suspect
[2022-08-17T00:07:20] Mirono escooters: Pls yes
[2022-08-17T00:07:27] Artem Bulashev: Which is fairly good level for most of us considering it so after all 100a rating
[2022-08-17T00:07:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Alu pcb only one layerü•≤
[2022-08-17T00:07:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs the problem
[2022-08-17T00:07:40] Unknown: If I replace the burned ones, will it be okay?
[2022-08-17T00:08:22] Artem Bulashev: 100v pcb contains high thickness copper btw
[2022-08-17T00:08:33] Mirono escooters: Prob not
[2022-08-17T00:08:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: So?
[2022-08-17T00:08:54] Artem Bulashev: Thicker than 75100 dual ubox
[2022-08-17T00:08:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: Problem isn‚Äôt electrical conductivity, that can be resolved with bus bar
[2022-08-17T00:08:59] Artem Bulashev: Which should help as well
[2022-08-17T00:09:11] Artem Bulashev: Heat transfer away from die
[2022-08-17T00:09:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: But only one face can be worked, then you need bigger or more pcb
[2022-08-17T00:09:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: One side can‚Äôt made circuit or solder components
[2022-08-17T00:09:34] Artem Bulashev: Yes that is the reason Spintend didn‚Äôt do it
[2022-08-17T00:09:39] Artem Bulashev: They said
[2022-08-17T00:09:51] Artem Bulashev: Flipsky put logic on other pcb and that is bad design
[2022-08-17T00:10:04] Artem Bulashev: I think they meant gates
[2022-08-17T00:10:14] Artem Bulashev: Which if so, is baaad idea
[2022-08-17T00:10:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: Xd spintend did the same
[2022-08-17T00:10:37] Artem Bulashev: On which one ?
[2022-08-17T00:10:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: They have mosfet drivers on another pcb
[2022-08-17T00:10:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: 75100
[2022-08-17T00:10:57] Artem Bulashev: Single ?
[2022-08-17T00:11:19] Artem Bulashev: Guess that‚Äôs how they figured that it is too bad üòÑüòÑ
[2022-08-17T00:11:32] Artem Bulashev: He said he doesn‚Äôt want to do it
[2022-08-17T00:11:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_5685@17-08-2022_00-11-41.jpg>
[2022-08-17T00:11:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_5686@17-08-2022_00-11-53.jpg>
[2022-08-17T00:11:55] Artem Bulashev: What it‚Äôs not on other side ?
[2022-08-17T00:11:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Mos drivers here
[2022-08-17T00:12:17] Unknown: Where can I find the m365 bms motherboard elements diagram?
[2022-08-17T00:12:22] Mirono escooters: Not
[2022-08-17T00:12:47] Artem Bulashev: This is not xiomi group sorry, try one of many dedicated groups for xiomi
[2022-08-17T00:12:54] Artem Bulashev: There are like 5
[2022-08-17T00:13:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_5687@17-08-2022_00-13-08.jpg>
[2022-08-17T00:13:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: Another wolf catched fire
[2022-08-17T00:13:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: Omg kaabo
[2022-08-17T00:13:33] Artem Bulashev: I see, they do look like they built logic board front those to be as close to fets as possible but still yeah
[2022-08-17T00:13:43] Artem Bulashev: Shit company
[2022-08-17T00:13:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: No engineering
[2022-08-17T00:14:04] Artem Bulashev: Both in one day reported on one group
[2022-08-17T00:14:04] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5689@17-08-2022_00-14-04.jpg>
[2022-08-17T00:14:15] Artem Bulashev: That new one too
[2022-08-17T00:14:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Their group admin deletes post after 10h of catched fire scooters
[2022-08-17T00:14:31] Artem Bulashev: May be customized?
[2022-08-17T00:14:47] Artem Bulashev: üòÑüòÑ
[2022-08-17T00:14:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Nope, there‚Äôs about 30 cases , nots the only
[2022-08-17T00:15:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: Their solution is 40A fuses (on 55A consumption)
[2022-08-17T00:15:45] Artem Bulashev: Well there is reason why in France Kaboo Mantis is the only escooter that was BLACK listed on National level!
[2022-08-17T00:16:34] Artem Bulashev: I think battery is not up to the task and over draw cells, that‚Äôs the only way to ignite it like that under load
[2022-08-17T00:17:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: They catch fire not during use, but when Parked xd
[2022-08-17T00:17:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: So 0 consumption
[2022-08-17T00:17:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: I still don‚Äôt know how is possible
[2022-08-17T00:17:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: Who told you this?
[2022-08-17T00:17:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: True @lBabacar ?ü•≤
[2022-08-17T00:18:35] Artem Bulashev: What
[2022-08-17T00:19:17] Artem Bulashev: That was wildly discussed 2-3 years ago, I used to live in Swiss french part so it was well talked
[2022-08-17T00:19:44] Artem Bulashev: I also don‚Äôt understand how it can be possible if nothing is moved
[2022-08-17T00:21:56] Mirono escooters: Thats allowed?
[2022-08-17T00:21:59] Mirono escooters: Just take it
[2022-08-17T00:22:12] Mirono escooters: Should take all xiaomi clones tooüò¥
[2022-08-17T00:22:55] Mirono escooters: F
[2022-08-17T00:23:15] Artem Bulashev: Yeap heard that about fake CE too but it was ultimately the multiple collective law suits that forced government to take that action under other pretenses
[2022-08-17T00:23:24] Artem Bulashev: True as well
[2022-08-17T00:23:38] Artem Bulashev: People getting shocked just by touching scooter handle bar
[2022-08-17T00:23:49] Artem Bulashev: Nuts
[2022-08-17T00:24:02] Mirono escooters: Lol gg well build
[2022-08-17T00:24:06] Artem Bulashev: Don‚Äôt even know how that is possible - guess hence the fires when nothing is happening
[2022-08-17T00:24:27] Artem Bulashev: ü§£ü§£
[2022-08-17T00:24:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: No way
[2022-08-17T00:24:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: @roscheeee love kaabo
[2022-08-17T00:25:22] Mirono escooters: How much tho, üòÇ
[2022-08-17T00:25:42] Artem Bulashev: 250‚Ç¨ a pop ? üòÑ
[2022-08-17T00:25:57] Artem Bulashev: Pun intended üòÇ
[2022-08-17T00:26:14] Mirono escooters: I mean hmu for a cheap ass price, some parts good for mod üòÇüòÇ
[2022-08-17T00:26:42] Artem Bulashev: ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
[2022-08-17T00:28:37] Artem Bulashev: I mean sniping stem alone in all 5y long revision, told me all I need to stay away üòÇüòÇ they can‚Äôt design shit. 60v on frame is just great shocking way to start away lol
[2022-08-17T00:29:58] Artem Bulashev: I actually remember what put me off Kaboo at time of choosing my first scooter
[2022-08-17T00:31:26] Artem Bulashev: It was that Kaboo first refused to acknowledge stem issue for 6 month, than blamed all the users that broke stems for a year, and only later released update that they said solved stem issue - only for stem assembly to break in other place ü§£
[2022-08-17T00:32:00] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-08-17T00:32:07] Artem Bulashev: F copy VSETT t that point
[2022-08-17T00:32:12] Artem Bulashev: Oh wait they did
[2022-08-17T00:32:56] Mirono escooters: Recycled coke aluminium can
[2022-08-17T00:35:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: Bms bad engineering
[2022-08-17T00:36:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: They got custom bms I think
[2022-08-17T00:36:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: Their cable are pressed
[2022-08-17T00:36:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: High risk of short circuit
[2022-08-17T00:36:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not exactly. faults found by french inspectors on kaboo exists on most escooters (unprotected gx16, poor wiring quality). inspectors just didn't look at other brands.
[2022-08-17T00:37:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: let's be honest, most escooters are built like shit...
[2022-08-17T00:37:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: So no kaabo in france?
[2022-08-17T00:38:18] Artem Bulashev: Yeah because there was no demand from community to block other brands due to constant life endangering failures - what you described was exactly what I meant ‚Äúunder other pretenses‚Äù
[2022-08-17T00:38:33] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5690@17-08-2022_00-38-33.jpg>

[2022-08-17T00:38:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: only mantis is banned

[2022-08-17T00:39:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: Look this xd
[2022-08-17T00:39:23] Artem Bulashev: I do like the look of that mantis gt pro max though
[2022-08-17T00:39:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: IQ 90000000
[2022-08-17T00:39:37] Artem Bulashev: What is that?
[2022-08-17T00:39:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_5693@17-08-2022_00-39-51.jpg>
[2022-08-17T00:39:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: Badly copied vsett
[2022-08-17T00:41:42] Artem Bulashev: ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è why did they make it spiral like üòÇüòÇ looks like it would weaken it structurally, but not sure to be honest‚Ä¶ ‚Äúbest part is the part that is not used because not needed‚Äù - first rule of engendering. ‚ÄúKISS - keep it stupid simple‚Äù second most important rule üòÇüòÇ I think they missed the memo
[2022-08-17T00:41:53] Tommy: Stole my photo!!!!!üòÇüòÇ
[2022-08-17T00:42:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: If people knew here I made a 24S7P 40T inside a Kaabo Mantis with high speed 10inch dual phase motors .. üòÇ
[2022-08-17T00:42:34] Tommy: I will report what u said to mattimei @PaoloWu
[2022-08-17T00:42:52] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5694@17-08-2022_00-42-52.jpg>
[2022-08-17T00:43:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it made nice flames too ? üòÅ
[2022-08-17T00:43:36] Artem Bulashev: I wonder more about this. Looks like multi part assembly, AGAIN üòÑ so that lock is holding not the stem but separate part of stem assembly ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è KISS again
[2022-08-17T00:43:59] Artem Bulashev: Yeap, they don‚Äôt learn it seems, try to copy without understanding why one or another works. The hinge they copied may be pure marketing decision. To get people thinking it is now designed as well as OG
[2022-08-17T00:44:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: Dual phase means dual cable ?
[2022-08-17T00:45:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: I hope you reinforced the frame with tig welding
[2022-08-17T00:45:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: <sticker>
[2022-08-17T00:47:54] Tommy: Vsett is the same i think
[2022-08-17T00:48:34] Tommy: Just not sanded
[2022-08-17T00:53:16] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes I burnt half of the battery 12S on the 24S üòÇ
[2022-08-17T00:53:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes

[2022-08-17T00:54:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: Don‚Äôt recommend dual cable motor, I had bad experiences
[2022-08-17T00:54:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: No problem kelly, with high frequency vesc something was wrong
[2022-08-17T00:54:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: Omg huameng motor
[2022-08-17T00:55:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: I used it with VESC no problem, vut last I used I rewired with 8AWG
[2022-08-17T00:55:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: 2 in one side last phase on other side
[2022-08-17T00:55:20] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes 50mm magnets
[2022-08-17T00:55:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: Vsett motor :)
[2022-08-17T00:55:44] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, now Vsett motor
[2022-08-17T00:55:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: But at this time, Vsett didn't even exist üòÇ
[2022-08-17T00:55:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Even in further dont use double cable
[2022-08-17T00:56:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: You have now 65h 10mm wire
[2022-08-17T00:56:21] Face de Pin Suc√©: I know üòÇ
[2022-08-17T00:56:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: Put it on oscilloscope
[2022-08-17T00:56:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: The goal was to use higher power by having double wires
[2022-08-17T00:56:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Just check what shit you get
[2022-08-17T00:57:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ask too at your friend raphael
[2022-08-17T00:57:40] Face de Pin Suc√©: But best was to rewire, 2 big phases on one side and last big phase on other side
[2022-08-17T00:58:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: I don't have anymore, only one left on my speedway leger rewired with 9AWG
[2022-08-17T00:58:34] Face de Pin Suc√©: No, I was using YYK 120100
[2022-08-17T00:58:39] Face de Pin Suc√©: Was 2 years ago
[2022-08-17T00:59:07] Face de Pin Suc√©: No no haha
[2022-08-17T01:46:10] sombre_enfant: Kinda
[2022-08-17T02:27:37] Artem Bulashev: Running two alternative time dependent lines with same frequency of alteration
[2022-08-17T02:27:41] Artem Bulashev: What can go wrong
[2022-08-17T02:30:33] Artem Bulashev: Oh right harmonics -> resonance in signal -> resonance in back-emf feed -> clock loss -> boom
[2022-08-17T02:30:36] Artem Bulashev: ü§£ü§£
[2022-08-17T02:30:54] Artem Bulashev: That is only potentially of course :))
[2022-08-17T02:31:56] Artem Bulashev: I never had such experience in high power applications, only in acoustic engineering field, which is different, but base principles should apply similarly
[2022-08-17T02:35:45] Artem Bulashev: Unless motor is wired those those as 6 phase motor and not double wiring for 3 phase
[2022-08-17T02:37:06] Artem Bulashev: There is also double voltage 3 phase wiring but I‚Äôm not too verst in that
[2022-08-17T02:42:29] rosheee: Lol
[2022-08-17T02:42:48] rosheee: Never received the controllers rion ceo told me
[2022-08-17T02:43:59] rosheee: Yah it is 15 days now
[2022-08-17T02:44:07] rosheee: Amyway Feels like 2 months
[2022-08-17T02:44:46] rosheee: Sadly the 6 phase motors gone..
[2022-08-17T06:55:20] Luis Magalhaes: My battery when ubox fail and short-circuit bms did not cut power i had to disconnect the xt90 and after disconecting i see a on top of a cell nikel getting hot was short-circuit above one cell
[2022-08-17T06:57:49] Luis Magalhaes: The niquel from battery didn't handle the amps it was discharged before bms cuts power, i think same thing appends in the GT, they say its a short-circuit on controllers üòÖ but a 40A fuse is just strange shen using 50A controller i think
[2022-08-17T09:18:38] rosheee: What
[2022-08-17T09:18:43] rosheee: XD kaabo?
[2022-08-17T09:47:55] Unknown: Did someone get trouble with this fuckish company Spintend? Instead of replacement of their faulty controller, they want me to ship this controller to them for repair and sure postal fees will be on my side!
[2022-08-17T09:48:14] Mirono escooters: Yes, as usual
[2022-08-17T09:48:43] Unknown: Gov here would fuck them for such practice

[2022-08-17T09:52:44] rosheee: Or try flipsky next time xD like 0 warranty
[2022-08-17T09:53:24] Unknown: Some another fuckish Chinese company doesn't mean it should be OK for another Chinese one too
[2022-08-17T09:54:38] Unknown: Nothing covered and yes fault happened even before 60 days
[2022-08-17T09:55:05] rosheee: They paid the shipping back to me
[2022-08-17T09:55:24] rosheee: It is their law there ^^

[2022-08-17T09:58:50] rosheee: They replaced it
[2022-08-17T09:59:02] rosheee: They gave u solution ^^'
[2022-08-17T10:01:23] Unknown: Nothing 'replaced', they want their controller, after "repair" this fuckish communist chinese garbage will quote me crazy sum of money even it is under warranty protection and for sure if I no pay, no see my controller back too
[2022-08-17T10:01:26] Mirono escooters: Sounds fair to me.. thats normal business practices
[2022-08-17T10:01:32] Mirono escooters: Calm down.
[2022-08-17T10:01:37] rosheee: No
[2022-08-17T10:01:46] rosheee: Omg..
[2022-08-17T10:01:49] Mirono escooters: Its spintend we know them. Dont be a dick
[2022-08-17T10:01:58] rosheee: I send them 1 esc back
[2022-08-17T10:02:02] rosheee: Replaced

[2022-08-17T10:02:43] Mirono escooters: Rofl
[2022-08-17T10:02:45] rosheee: They do the same lol
[2022-08-17T10:02:47] Mirono escooters: Sure buddy
[2022-08-17T10:03:25] rosheee: I cut me out here
[2022-08-17T10:04:20] Unknown: I have to run on only one motor then(esca), I will not plan to send anything to these scammers otherwise I will lose money as well as controller and no movement here on scooter for months
[2022-08-17T10:04:33] rosheee: Dude wtf u talking
[2022-08-17T10:04:42] rosheee: I send back

[2022-08-17T10:05:29] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2022-08-17T10:05:34] rosheee: Now shipping to eypensive and they csnt send me a new one
[2022-08-17T10:05:35] rosheee: Wow
[2022-08-17T10:05:40] rosheee: That american business model
[2022-08-17T10:05:49] Mirono escooters: This reminds me of a fb group "Conservatives making shit up then getting mad about it"
[2022-08-17T10:06:11] Unknown: At least it is honest business by americans, not these fuckish chinese
[2022-08-17T10:06:17] rosheee: Lol xD
[2022-08-17T10:06:20] rosheee: <sticker>

[2022-08-17T10:13:53] Mirono escooters: Hahahaha
[2022-08-17T10:13:59] Unknown: Spintend controller has faulty escb part(Vcc on SWD port has 0.68V instead of 3.3V) so this Amy from Spintend wrote that is likely their microroccesor fault and nothing can be done on my side
[2022-08-17T10:14:12] Mirono escooters: Cheap, but upgradable
[2022-08-17T10:27:57] Unknown: I started to work on their controller on 7th of July, it is proved by emails with them..even from this date no 60 days passed for no question replacement! And now these Spintend scammers want their controller firstly and sure to pay for postage to China as well as repair fee
[2022-08-17T10:29:10] Mirono escooters: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2022-08-17T10:29:39] Mirono escooters: I cant with you
[2022-08-17T10:30:33] Unknown: What you can't? I am not fanboy of scooters, controllers etc, I only connected it, no firmware programming etc, simple riding only
[2022-08-17T10:31:01] Mirono escooters: Your biased blabla about spintend is what i cant with you
[2022-08-17T10:32:50] Unknown: I hoped that these vesc 'cool' controllers are better than stock ones, which I refused to replace after stock got faulty..as result another, triple expensive Spintend to comparing to stock one, got faulty!
[2022-08-17T10:33:10] rosheee: Spintend send me new stuff fpr frew
[2022-08-17T10:33:10] rosheee: For rion stuff i wait since 2 weeks
[2022-08-17T10:33:11] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2022-08-17T10:50:03] Unknown: Can someone examinate if this PCB has something suspicious? Escb is faulty(bottom part)
[2022-08-17T11:02:44] Gigolo Joe: Not bad throttles Can be better tho
[2022-08-17T11:05:36] Unknown: LEDs if switched on
[2022-08-17T11:21:09] Luis Magalhaes: Kabummmm üòÇ
[2022-08-17T13:00:24] rosheee: Badab00m
[2022-08-17T13:28:41] Mohammad: Send a better picture And describe your problem. Does it take too much current? Do anything get hot? Or just it doesn't drive motor
[2022-08-17T13:45:58] rosheee: XD just send it back omg
[2022-08-17T13:46:31] rosheee: Is it powerstage or mainboard related?
[2022-08-17T13:46:55] rosheee: YES
[2022-08-17T13:47:02] rosheee: They have best support so far
[2022-08-17T13:48:32] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: These are Vesc boards or hoverboard controllers?
[2022-08-17T14:20:19] Unknown: Sorry..here is night..maybe on sunlights I will take better quality. It doesn't start motor at all(escb outputs), no lights on 3 LEDs(escb) although Vcc on ESCB has 3.3V, Vcc on SWD(ESCB) has 0.68V(has to be 3.3V too).
[2022-08-17T14:21:18] Unknown: It is Spintend controller - Ubox V2 75V100A X2
[2022-08-17T14:22:41] Unknown: Under this board is another board with power transistors/capacitors
[2022-08-17T14:27:18] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Why are those so expensive, should you not get a discount for buying more at once?
[2022-08-17T14:28:54] Unknown: What do you mean buying more? I bought only one. Now their website shows lower price for it, these scammers explain that they use another elements now and decreased price..still want to buy from them?
[2022-08-17T14:29:16] Mirono escooters: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2022-08-17T14:33:43] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: I was comparing cheap single controllers to duals and found it is cheaper to do it all twice than to sell half the numbers of duals that have much worse replacement rate ...
[2022-08-17T14:35:44] Unknown: I guess you are right, I just was advised to buy this one. From the logic of this controller, it has connection by canbus, so yes, it seems two controllers in one case. I can ride my scooter even escb part is faulty(one motor instead of two)
[2022-08-17T14:56:04] rosheee: Just send them the esc back xD
[2022-08-17T15:06:23] Mirono escooters: He rather bitch about made up stuff
[2022-08-17T15:11:34] Mohammad: Possible mcu problem. Mcu gets hot when connected?
[2022-08-17T15:22:12] Unknown: Where is mcu?
[2022-08-17T15:26:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: mcu = microcontroller
[2022-08-17T15:27:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: = stm32 on vesc
[2022-08-17T16:08:40] sombre_enfant: Water damage go crazy and i dont even have torx set with me...
[2022-08-17T16:09:02] Mirono escooters: Water dmg where
[2022-08-17T16:10:00] sombre_enfant: There was water till my feet on the board
[2022-08-17T16:10:12] sombre_enfant: Idk how its still alive
[2022-08-17T16:11:17] sombre_enfant: I stay a few day in a place without tool so idk id it will survive
[2022-08-17T16:12:56] Mirono escooters: Oof
[2022-08-17T16:13:04] Mirono escooters: Shouldve siliconed it.. :)
[2022-08-17T16:13:27] Mirono escooters: I always silicon batt and bottom fully shut
[2022-08-17T16:48:02] Luis Magalhaes: Put it on rice at home üòÇ
[2022-08-17T17:10:24] Artem Bulashev: Guys
[2022-08-17T17:10:41] Mirono escooters: Mm
[2022-08-17T17:10:43] Artem Bulashev: I started working with Spintend on next vesc idea design
[2022-08-17T17:11:00] Artem Bulashev: Fets mounting / cooling solution comes first to discussion.
[2022-08-17T17:11:02] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5705@17-08-2022_17-11-02.jpg>
[2022-08-17T17:11:10] Artem Bulashev: This is what we have
[2022-08-17T17:11:32] Artem Bulashev: So new single 100v will be equal or even better than best before 75200 ubox
[2022-08-17T17:11:40] Artem Bulashev: üôÇüôÇ
[2022-08-17T17:12:24] Artem Bulashev: Question is what would be ideal shape on controller, to fit each escooter - dedicated to Escooters!
[2022-08-17T17:13:40] Artem Bulashev: One of ideas was 90 degree fets down to the deck - with psb verticals. So it would be around 25mm thick, 52mm high, 85mm long, cooling mass is less but heat transfer ALOT better to deck
[2022-08-17T17:15:10] Artem Bulashev: Or flat smt fets with aluminum pcb ( than 25mm -30mm high, 52 wide and 85mm long) Dimentions are just sort of maximum target dimentions to try fit in
[2022-08-17T17:15:31] Artem Bulashev: Idea is that two singles with strong can line are better than one dual. Do you agree? (If no sacrifice on size)
[2022-08-17T17:16:24] Artem Bulashev: Any input is highly welcome, we have chance to design community driven vesc on professional manufacturing powers
[2022-08-17T17:17:17] Mirono escooters: Agree
[2022-08-17T17:23:28] Artem Bulashev: On
[2022-08-17T17:24:07] Artem Bulashev: Aluminum pcb on long term has higher heat up over long term, than new 100v copper
[2022-08-17T17:29:13] Artem Bulashev: - current path I think he refers to traces on that vesc being thinner than what Spintend used on new 100v single or May be just the way they arranged. But cool info regardless
[2022-08-17T17:35:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: kelly/nucular seems to have interesting designs : mosfets at 90¬∞ of pcb, logic board on another pcb at 90¬∞ of the power pcb
[2022-08-17T17:37:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: main issue : logic board is soldered to pcb with very complicated access. really hard to repair. the same, but removable would be perfet
[2022-08-17T17:37:15] Mirono escooters: So they say.. the alu Flipsky is.. better?
[2022-08-17T17:38:55] Artem Bulashev: Second idea is - remove all the extra shit from vesc, like 2.4ghz, Bluetooth, dc-dc 12v, break light ports outputs, horn output, and other extras, all beside Button operation - creat a port for snap on module (All in one Integration module - brake/throttle input with 3.3v logic conversion, lights and horn, input/outputs, addressable led support, oem screen integrator, Bluetooth to be used for OEM Integrator configuring and Vesc configuring. Result in theory, smaller vesc it self with optimal cooling solution. All extras we need concentrated in snap on module (optionally small extension cable to go between one vesc integrator module). May be price reduction on vescs there for.
[2022-08-17T17:39:55] Artem Bulashev: In burst Aluminum perform about same, amazingly well 200a phase. But on long term new 100v copper block Ubox single wins - keeps it cooler
[2022-08-17T17:42:00] Artem Bulashev: Removable has danger of loosing connection due to shakes, but I will def also look into that May help creat more volume dense vesc ‚úÖ
[2022-08-17T17:45:53] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Finally
[2022-08-17T17:46:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: there are some nasty connectors for automotive... i ap not talking about classic 2/2.54 pich connectors üòú
[2022-08-17T17:59:00] Artem Bulashev: üòÅüòÅ
[2022-08-17T18:00:57] Artem Bulashev: Will look into possibilities for sure. I like idea of vesc that occupies less Surface. I would prefer it to occupy hight, as there are so many that require surface but nearly non that do not
[2022-08-17T18:02:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: don't remove 12v ! very usefull for accessories (and smartdisplay üòÅ)
[2022-08-17T18:02:29] Artem Bulashev: If we were to split it into two that would - allow for more variations of install (back to back together / one closer to each wheel) - smaller size of unit, May be fit more scooters thus
[2022-08-17T18:02:58] Konstantin: 12v it's anyway for drive drivers...
[2022-08-17T18:04:12] Artem Bulashev: How much you require ?
[2022-08-17T18:04:42] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Well about the Flipsky "it doesn't die on it's own", mine died without any particular reason. üòÖ Regular Flipsky 75100, came back from a ride all good, charged and wanted to go for a ride the next day, not booting anymore. Had to replace it with another one.
[2022-08-17T18:05:10] Artem Bulashev: Any idea how much amps those require?
[2022-08-17T18:06:29] Artem Bulashev: I was thinking we could reduce size of 12v dc-dc because in spit set up it doesn‚Äôt make much sense to have 3amps 12 twice. Better off have 12v 4amp in integration module
[2022-08-17T18:09:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 3a is good. enought for general front/rear lights
[2022-08-17T18:09:57] Artem Bulashev: Oh so full power. Do you know how big is 75- 12v 3a circuite?
[2022-08-17T18:10:21] Artem Bulashev: Would we save a lot of space if we reduced it down to only what needed for drivers?
[2022-08-17T18:10:30] Artem Bulashev: On each of single vesc
[2022-08-17T18:11:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes
[2022-08-17T18:11:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but i also know it's a nightmare to have external dc-dc
[2022-08-17T18:12:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: either they are 'always on', or you need an enable signal from another circuit. both cases are bad from my point of view.
[2022-08-17T18:13:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: on ubox, the main dc-dc must be what... 3/4cm2 ?
[2022-08-17T18:14:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and violent step-down from vbat to 5v is also an issue (need bigger capacitors to stabilize the voltage if i understood correctly), and effeciency is often reduced.
[2022-08-17T18:18:09] Artem Bulashev: As said above 12v would still need to be on board for drivers, so 5v could be step down from that I suppose.
[2022-08-17T18:18:31] Artem Bulashev: But I get your drift, May not worth trhe trouble
[2022-08-17T18:20:16] Artem Bulashev: Idea is to try minimize size and cost without cutting out 50% of the design components on vesc, that‚Äôs what flip sky does
[2022-08-17T18:21:15] Artem Bulashev: That‚Äôs why they cost less and burn out randomly I suppose vs Spintend does it a lot less and trampa who know, rarely see any one use it (seem to be solid too of course)
[2022-08-17T18:32:41] Konstantin: 2k I'm, flypsky, all ok...mb something wrong w me ;) How people burn them ü§£ If use correct firmware+ inspection and fix small issues...
[2022-08-17T18:33:39] Konstantin: 1 day my motor spin...cut all hall wires +5v lines... Just throw them, enable sensosless mode, and continue drive....
[2022-08-17T18:34:55] Konstantin: For this price...it's assume... sometimes need only reinforce few things
[2022-08-17T18:35:39] Mirono escooters: Im Flipsky too
[2022-08-17T18:35:42] Mirono escooters: (sry)
[2022-08-17T18:38:24] rosheee: <photos/photo_5707@17-08-2022_18-38-24.jpg>
[2022-08-17T18:38:28] rosheee: Solution xD
[2022-08-17T18:42:10] Mirono escooters: 8mm banana?
[2022-08-17T18:50:33] rosheee: Yo
[2022-08-17T18:51:09] Mirono escooters: Das for the real o'es
[2022-08-17T18:52:05] rosheee: Biggest i got
[2022-08-17T18:52:18] rosheee: <photos/photo_5708@17-08-2022_18-52-18.jpg>
[2022-08-17T19:03:32] Artem Bulashev: I can‚Äôt imagine using it without on/off button.
[2022-08-17T19:13:02] Konstantin: Smart bms, 1 button. Or...few ways...
[2022-08-17T19:13:55] Konstantin: T12, 15-20 sec, and ready to go ;)
[2022-08-17T19:15:20] Konstantin: Key, button, nfc, nfc(smartfone), key less sysnet, fingerprint.... Any card...
[2022-08-17T19:16:38] Mirono escooters: We got cheap card activated buttons yet?
[2022-08-17T19:16:47] Mirono escooters: Like on some scootd i like concept
[2022-08-17T19:17:50] Konstantin: 20$-40$ and you can. Use any available way for access;)
[2022-08-17T19:18:28] Konstantin: Chinese 'D
[2022-08-17T19:36:47] Artem Bulashev: How would you use it with vesc?
[2022-08-17T19:36:50] Artem Bulashev: Any links?
[2022-08-17T19:37:22] Artem Bulashev: With flipsky. With ubox I can imagine should be easy to use something else instead of button as circuitry is there
[2022-08-17T19:38:29] Konstantin: Will receive my flypsky, show ;). Or tomorrow then come to city, how it works at the moment in my solution
[2022-08-17T19:40:04] Artem Bulashev: Ok üëå because I thought to shut off flipsky you need to shut BMS off add external circuitry
[2022-08-17T19:40:40] Mirono escooters: Bluetooth bms luckily shutoff option
[2022-08-17T19:40:51] Artem Bulashev: 65‚Ç¨?? üòÇüòÇ
[2022-08-17T19:41:02] Artem Bulashev: Da hell is wrong with them :))
[2022-08-17T19:41:03] Mirono escooters: Scam 35‚Ç¨ normal
[2022-08-17T19:41:16] Konstantin: Any way it's easy to add enable pin ;))) And use all like u wish. Default flipsky don't use it, dc-dc has internal pull up resistor, and it's always enable
[2022-08-17T19:41:49] Konstantin: Llt bms has option to install button (switch)
[2022-08-17T19:41:55] Konstantin: I use it ;)
[2022-08-17T19:41:59] Mirono escooters: Flipsky just to sell antispark, only thing i dissaprovr
[2022-08-17T19:42:11] Artem Bulashev: Yeah ant as well, I think all main smart BMS do
[2022-08-17T19:42:23] Mirono escooters: Daly.. :)
[2022-08-17T19:42:53] Artem Bulashev: Big and fat and bad ü§¢
[2022-08-17T19:44:26] Mirono escooters: ;)
[2022-08-17T19:46:50] rosheee: @Joondalup this is scam xD
[2022-08-17T19:47:16] rosheee: Fat?
[2022-08-17T19:47:29] Mirono escooters: Fuk daly
[2022-08-17T19:47:31] rosheee: Dimensions of 150a cont. Bms pls @artBula
[2022-08-17T19:47:39] rosheee: Need advice
[2022-08-17T19:47:44] rosheee: For kaab00
[2022-08-17T19:48:29] rosheee: I run for testing 1 motor and esc with 1x20S So 2x20S each motor 1x 20S lol
[2022-08-17T20:18:22] Artem Bulashev: Yeah thick
[2022-08-17T20:21:20] sombre_enfant: How i clean water damage?
[2022-08-17T20:21:27] Artem Bulashev: Look this size
[2022-08-17T20:22:35] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5711@17-08-2022_20-22-35.jpg>
[2022-08-17T20:33:05] Konstantin: Nice, use assume fets inside üí†;)
[2022-08-17T20:33:53] Konstantin: <photos/photo_5712@17-08-2022_20-33-53.jpg>
[2022-08-17T20:33:53] Konstantin: <photos/photo_5713@17-08-2022_20-33-53.jpg>
[2022-08-17T20:36:15] Konstantin: Test one unit, üëç
[2022-08-17T20:36:42] Konstantin: And 6-22s, 4...no...
[2022-08-17T20:36:52] Mohammad: If water is inside your board yet use air compressor to blow water off the board, then use a brush and isopropyl alcohol to clean oxides on board, double check tiny components as they may be corroded. by poking them slightly make sure they're not desoldered. If they come off you should replace them
[2022-08-17T20:43:12] Mirono escooters: Not 4s?
[2022-08-17T20:43:57] Konstantin: No, 6 minimum, looks like 6, if use lto or something, and need voltage to open fets ;)
[2022-08-17T20:45:00] Konstantin: And u can decrease lower than 6. PC/phone software, don't matter
[2022-08-17T21:24:13] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Any idea how much phase amps the Spintend Ubox Single 100v is going to handle? "Current 100A max" is most likely battery current?
[2022-08-17T21:25:52] sombre_enfant: 60/170
[2022-08-17T21:26:13] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 60A Batt, 170A Phase?
[2022-08-17T21:28:30] sombre_enfant: Yes
[2022-08-17T21:28:39] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Ok good.
[2022-08-17T21:30:36] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Hope they ship soon... Already 17th of August.
[2022-08-17T21:30:54] rosheee: For 240A cont.?
[2022-08-17T21:31:09] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: They say 100A continuous.
[2022-08-17T21:31:16] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I ordered one too, might try it as well.
[2022-08-17T21:33:00] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @lBabacar I sent 3 mails to Flipsky about the issue with the BMS cut-outs... No response so far. üòê
[2022-08-17T21:34:06] rosheee: Write them in instagram
[2022-08-17T21:34:09] rosheee: Or aliexpress
[2022-08-17T21:34:26] rosheee: I need 240A cont.
[2022-08-17T21:34:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Ah good idea, I could do that. Maybe they answer there. I don't have Instagram tho.
[2022-08-17T21:34:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: At least my current Flipsky 75100 is lasting well.
[2022-08-17T21:35:07] rosheee: What hsppened?
[2022-08-17T21:36:01] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Not sure, the last one died randomly after my ride, not booting anymore and before that I was dealing with BMS cut-outs which always kill MOSFETs, which I solved by swapping BMS.
[2022-08-17T21:47:36] Mirono escooters: Why run that through a bms
[2022-08-17T21:47:40] Mirono escooters: Powerwall level amps
[2022-08-17T22:09:08] rosheee: 150A bms is eZ
[2022-08-17T22:09:16] rosheee: Set 240A max
[2022-08-17T22:09:38] rosheee: Doing 12.5kw cont. No pron
[2022-08-17T22:10:06] Luis Magalhaes: My ant 300A is not complaining üòÇ
[2022-08-17T22:13:32] Kris: I was in the same boat 2x 75100 on two 2800w motors and want to get more amps and had to get bigger bms couldn't find small size and bluetooth smart bms
[2022-08-17T22:14:07] Kris: <photos/photo_5714@17-08-2022_22-14-07.jpg>
[2022-08-17T22:14:20] Kris: Now I willbe stuck with the right one
[2022-08-17T22:14:29] Mirono escooters: Good choice
[2022-08-17T22:16:34] Konstantin: What wrong w left one?)
[2022-08-17T22:16:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: The right one is 250A the left is 100A.
[2022-08-17T22:17:03] Kris: Only 100A
[2022-08-17T22:17:23] Konstantin: This 6fets, like usual*3, 18 fets, ~ 180a
[2022-08-17T22:18:09] Konstantin: And 20+ fets
[2022-08-17T22:18:31] Mirono escooters: The llt has alot of fets
[2022-08-17T22:18:51] Konstantin: But trash ant, and all Chinese usually count like 1 fet 10+ amps
[2022-08-17T22:18:57] Konstantin: Y
[2022-08-17T22:19:05] Konstantin: I have 20-30 one
[2022-08-17T22:19:41] rosheee: In what?
[2022-08-17T22:21:33] Konstantin: <photos/photo_5715@17-08-2022_22-21-33.jpg>
[2022-08-17T22:21:40] Konstantin: 20+20

[2022-08-17T22:22:46] rosheee: Aha
[2022-08-17T22:24:04] Kris: And that would go on xiaomi m365 pro which now has 2x1000w
[2022-08-17T22:24:19] Kris: <photos/photo_5717@17-08-2022_22-24-19.jpg>

[2022-08-17T22:36:58] Kris: To make it fit
[2022-08-17T22:37:10] Mirono escooters: On my m365 classic i machined custom longer axles, then it fitted
[2022-08-17T22:37:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Oh ok.
[2022-08-17T22:38:05] Kris: And offcourse longer bolts

[2022-08-17T22:41:17] Mirono escooters: 350w Xiaomi is 60
[2022-08-17T22:41:20] Kris: And had it on generic 72v ebike controllers and it is about right 85-90kmh
[2022-08-17T22:42:49] Kris: But I am going to cross that 100 km/h line with that frameüòÇ
[2022-08-17T22:42:59] Mirono escooters: Oh oh
[2022-08-17T22:43:04] Mirono escooters: Good luck :p
[2022-08-17T22:43:24] Mirono escooters: Monorim, stock spring, xtech Xiaomi frame Good for 150 id say
[2022-08-17T22:44:01] Kris: üòÇüòç
[2022-08-17T22:48:16] Kris: Front is different but I have a pair of those cheapish ones,that annoybike store on AliExpress,I bought a kit 48v had them laying around and said lets use them for something but they are holding up nicely the only problem is wheelspin
[2022-08-17T23:08:11] Artem Bulashev: I think new manual says 21s max
[2022-08-17T23:09:11] Artem Bulashev: but still even if 6-21s 100a üòÑüòÑ that hell of tiny BMS, the only BMS 100a smart in 10mm thickness!
[2022-08-17T23:09:57] Mirono escooters: Indeed And limited by connectors lol
[2022-08-17T23:10:04] Jan: Length and width? 10mm thickness is insane :D
[2022-08-17T23:10:05] Artem Bulashev: No idea, use, two of those 20mm still will be very good
[2022-08-17T23:10:12] Artem Bulashev: On photo
[2022-08-17T23:10:27] Artem Bulashev: 130 X 60 X 10mm
[2022-08-17T23:10:43] Artem Bulashev: Untypically Small in all dimentions for 100a smart
[2022-08-17T23:11:07] Jan: hmm well with 10mm height 130mm should not be an issue
[2022-08-17T23:11:16] Artem Bulashev: True and wire awg
[2022-08-17T23:11:28] Mirono escooters: Otherwise even mpre
[2022-08-17T23:11:32] Jan: 100a per motor continuous for G30 is ok
[2022-08-17T23:11:51] Artem Bulashev: Yeah but use stock 350w motor please
[2022-08-17T23:11:54] Mirono escooters: Per motor jezus

[2022-08-18T00:52:39] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: If ya know about thunder 2, so gt2 in race+boost mode is faster than thunder 2 until 50 km/h in about 100-200ms. Then thunder 2 is faster than gt2 until 60 km/h in about 300-400ms. Thunder 2 is rated 72v 120A battery summed peak. Gt2: 52v and 60A battery summed peak
[2022-08-18T00:52:40] Artem Bulashev: I‚Äôm confused, you just said you run 135a front and rear setting
[2022-08-18T00:53:21] Artem Bulashev: Now you say 180a front and 200a rear and 250a absolute on each You are so confusing üòÑ
[2022-08-18T00:53:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: The difference is in just great implemented code and algorithms;)
[2022-08-18T00:54:25] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Also guys, gt2 has 2 motors, but 1 mcu on esc
[2022-08-18T00:55:35] Artem Bulashev: Makes perfect sense
[2022-08-18T00:55:46] Artem Bulashev: That‚Äôs incorrect you didn‚Äôt loose it to heat
[2022-08-18T00:56:12] Jan: No not 30%
[2022-08-18T00:56:55] Jan: 30% less power. Generated heat was a lot more than before but unknown how much
[2022-08-18T00:58:53] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 30A battery per motor, yes
[2022-08-18T00:59:08] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Not phase
[2022-08-18T01:00:39] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Thats peak summed phase
[2022-08-18T01:01:15] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Battery only delivers 60A max
[2022-08-18T01:01:44] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Phase currents (motors currents) are always more than battery current
[2022-08-18T01:02:44] Artem Bulashev: 1. Heat up on fets happen because of constant motor regen to slow down the wheel that starts to spin faster than it should
[2022-08-18T01:03:12] Artem Bulashev: Loss of acceleration for same reason, you get micro ebrakes
[2022-08-18T01:04:13] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I mean. Thunder 2 is claimed twice more powerful than gt2
[2022-08-18T01:04:15] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Thats it
[2022-08-18T01:04:31] Artem Bulashev: Correct
[2022-08-18T01:04:32] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But its not
[2022-08-18T01:04:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: 12kw vs 6kW
[2022-08-18T01:04:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: Lol
[2022-08-18T01:04:43] Artem Bulashev: Correct
[2022-08-18T01:05:17] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Correct
[2022-08-18T01:05:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: Motors are ok
[2022-08-18T01:05:52] Artem Bulashev: Higher voltage give advantage of full phase amps being available for up to higher speed
[2022-08-18T01:06:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: Controller is 20$ chinese controller with better mosfers
[2022-08-18T01:06:23] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Its just poor system overall
[2022-08-18T01:06:26] Artem Bulashev: And thus full acceleration pulls not only up to 40kmh but up to 60kmh for example the
[2022-08-18T01:06:26] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Not worth
[2022-08-18T01:07:41] Artem Bulashev: Wats calculate full charge voltage -10% * (controllers amp rating together *1.2 peak above rating)
[2022-08-18T01:08:43] Artem Bulashev: In theory rear wheel should not spin faster than front at any time so yeah
[2022-08-18T01:09:06] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I think when custom firmware comes out and it will be possible to remove the speed limit on gt2, then it will generally bypass thunder 2 completely, with only slightly adding current
[2022-08-18T01:09:06] Artem Bulashev: -10% is battery voltage sag
[2022-08-18T01:09:36] Artem Bulashev: 1.2 is how much you should expect to go above rated battery amps on peak load
[2022-08-18T01:09:46] Artem Bulashev: Marketing
[2022-08-18T01:10:03] Artem Bulashev: Thir calculation is wrong
[2022-08-18T01:10:26] Artem Bulashev: Which is evident by performance not being as different as paper spec make it look
[2022-08-18T01:11:08] Artem Bulashev: Nominal of of the motor
[2022-08-18T01:11:16] Artem Bulashev: It‚Äôs easy
[2022-08-18T01:11:22] Artem Bulashev: Same math
[2022-08-18T01:11:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, they want to sell it for sure
[2022-08-18T01:11:43] Artem Bulashev: 60v*35= 2100w
[2022-08-18T01:12:02] Artem Bulashev: Which is what VSETT claim is more peak continius power
[2022-08-18T01:12:30] Artem Bulashev: They claim Nominal 1400 peak 2100
[2022-08-18T01:12:44] Artem Bulashev: VSETT9 650w 1100w
[2022-08-18T01:13:34] Artem Bulashev: Peak is basically max controller power can do
[2022-08-18T01:13:54] Artem Bulashev: Nominal is calculated according to specific way and conditions
[2022-08-18T01:14:05] Artem Bulashev: Simple
[2022-08-18T01:14:24] Artem Bulashev: VSETT calculates nominal power properly as per some standard
[2022-08-18T01:14:40] Artem Bulashev: But Chinese shits often put random value
[2022-08-18T01:15:16] Artem Bulashev: I have seen standardized procedure for nominal power testing
[2022-08-18T01:15:31] Artem Bulashev: No no it so opposite supposed to be
[2022-08-18T01:15:43] Artem Bulashev: They supposed to measure nominal
[2022-08-18T01:15:45] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Chineneers*
[2022-08-18T01:15:47] Artem Bulashev: Per standard
[2022-08-18T01:16:48] Artem Bulashev: And than peak is claimed of what ever they think motor will survive or will experience in that system- so can be very different depending on what manufacturer implies
[2022-08-18T01:17:14] Artem Bulashev: But those are useless as per reason above
[2022-08-18T01:17:39] Artem Bulashev: 10000 peak on one scooter can be equal to 6000 peak on other
[2022-08-18T01:18:25] Artem Bulashev: Because one scooter meant that is where it will burn and other meant that is what you will actually experience at most on this system (like what VSETT does)
[2022-08-18T01:18:58] Artem Bulashev: I find nominal to be more consistent
[2022-08-18T01:19:07] Artem Bulashev: Across brands and models
[2022-08-18T01:19:17] Artem Bulashev: Yeah easy
[2022-08-18T01:20:03] Artem Bulashev: Well not easy but it does
[2022-08-18T01:20:45] Artem Bulashev: Thing about max speed is that you actually stop accelerating
[2022-08-18T01:20:54] Artem Bulashev: And that lowers amp draw
[2022-08-18T01:21:08] Artem Bulashev: So just before max speed you do draw max
[2022-08-18T01:23:39] Artem Bulashev: This doesn‚Äôt actually show exactly correct what happens at the end
[2022-08-18T01:27:05] Artem Bulashev: This is how it would look on saturated motor Motor can‚Äôt gain more speed as motor voltage is already at its highest - losses from battery voltage To maintain that speed you don‚Äôt require as much amps as you need to get to it.
[2022-08-18T01:29:59] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: And the rest is going to overtake wind. More speed = more battery current
[2022-08-18T01:30:39] Artem Bulashev: Well let me develop further because it is missleading abit what you said
[2022-08-18T01:30:57] Artem Bulashev: More amps will get you closer to free air wheel spin speed at specific battery voltage
[2022-08-18T01:31:02] Artem Bulashev: But never above
[2022-08-18T01:31:13] Artem Bulashev: Only higher voltage can get you above that
[2022-08-18T01:31:15] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, sure
[2022-08-18T01:31:23] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Right
[2022-08-18T01:31:29] Mirono escooters: And field weakening
[2022-08-18T01:31:44] Artem Bulashev: That basically simulates higher voltage
[2022-08-18T01:31:51] Artem Bulashev: If I undersnd correctly
[2022-08-18T01:31:53] Mirono escooters: Fair enough
[2022-08-18T01:31:58] Artem Bulashev: Not 100% sure about it
[2022-08-18T01:31:59] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I meant if we dont have speed limit by voltage limit
[2022-08-18T01:32:34] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I dont like itü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2022-08-18T01:32:42] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Prefer higher voltage
[2022-08-18T01:33:56] Mirono escooters: But ksh cool woodoo shit
[2022-08-18T01:34:27] Artem Bulashev: One thing i don‚Äôt know is how changing nothing but battery voltage to higher one will effect acceleration at the lower end before battery amp limit used to kick in
[2022-08-18T01:35:08] Artem Bulashev: In theory performance 0-> speed where battery limit started to cut phase amps should remain same
[2022-08-18T01:35:48] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I think its where pwm comes in
[2022-08-18T01:35:53] Artem Bulashev: But higher voltage battery will provide higher watts available in input so it should maintain full phase for longer there for (till higher speed)
[2022-08-18T01:36:28] Artem Bulashev: Or you will have an option to use more phase amps till same speed level where it will than be cut as well
[2022-08-18T01:36:36] Artem Bulashev: No
[2022-08-18T01:36:43] Artem Bulashev: That‚Äôs the thing
[2022-08-18T01:36:49] Artem Bulashev: Does it?
[2022-08-18T01:37:20] Artem Bulashev: What you are saying is that motor will be gaining voltage faster
[2022-08-18T01:37:25] Artem Bulashev: But that should not happen in theory
[2022-08-18T01:39:36] Artem Bulashev: So if 48v battery limits 100a phase at 40kmh than 60v battery will in fact have identical performance 0-40kmh if all settings remain the same on VESC (because phase and battery amps are limited and controlled, unlike basic controllers where phase amps ARE NOT limited and not controlled)
[2022-08-18T01:40:05] Artem Bulashev: That‚Äôs the thing, it should not
[2022-08-18T01:40:11] Artem Bulashev: Because motor KV is same
[2022-08-18T01:40:15] Artem Bulashev: We didn‚Äôt change it
[2022-08-18T01:40:36] Artem Bulashev: And thus motor voltage = to rpm so motor watts remain same
[2022-08-18T01:42:03] Artem Bulashev: Yeah because more watts now avaible on input = similar as if you were to increase phase amps propositional to battery voltage increase (60v/48v= 1.25times )
[2022-08-18T01:42:32] Artem Bulashev: Again at same watt level yes
[2022-08-18T01:42:56] Artem Bulashev: But if you keep same amps pushed you make more watts but also more losses
[2022-08-18T01:43:25] Artem Bulashev: Generally speaking 6000w will be more efficient on 75v battery than 48v battery
[2022-08-18T01:43:48] Artem Bulashev: Heat come from amps not watts
[2022-08-18T01:43:52] Artem Bulashev: So that‚Äôs why
[2022-08-18T01:45:50] Artem Bulashev: I have not seen any log that would confirm my opinion on that or deny. No one really tried identical set up on different voltage batteries :(
[2022-08-18T01:46:59] Artem Bulashev: I think xiomi community does a lot of over voltage external 3s packs, may be they have log of before and after connecting extra 3s without changing settings - basic controller though
[2022-08-18T01:47:40] Artem Bulashev: Voltage sag a lot less
[2022-08-18T01:48:05] Artem Bulashev: That is how I felt
[2022-08-18T01:48:29] Artem Bulashev: But theory says it should not be the case
[2022-08-18T01:48:45] Artem Bulashev: Have you changed settings ?
[2022-08-18T01:49:53] Artem Bulashev: Voltage sag at 0-8kmh should not effect as battery current limit is not reached yet, this phase amps still should have sam curve
[2022-08-18T01:51:12] Artem Bulashev: From my experience I also concluded same - as if motor got up to full phase amps faster. But I don‚Äôt know why it would feel this way
[2022-08-18T01:51:37] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-08-18T01:52:09] Artem Bulashev: Same settings full high voltage battery and than same place like underground garage (No wind)
[2022-08-18T01:52:34] Artem Bulashev: Why would they ramp up faster, I don‚Äôt know what it depends on
[2022-08-18T01:52:42] Artem Bulashev: Any one ?
[2022-08-18T01:55:05] Artem Bulashev: My first impression was that scooter watts output increased from 0kmh - since phase amps remained same, I first concluded that motor voltage growth curve because steeper, but than it should not as motor kv dictates it based of rpm, so curve should have same slope justvshould go further till higher rpm/volt
[2022-08-18T01:57:56] Artem Bulashev: Need to plot phase amps and motor voltage both against time on bottom
[2022-08-18T01:58:34] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2022-08-18T01:59:00] Artem Bulashev: Sounds like with higher voltage battery, peak phase amp goes higher above phase setting value
[2022-08-18T01:59:06] Artem Bulashev: May be that‚Äôs why
[2022-08-18T01:59:17] Artem Bulashev: So we experience higher punch -
[2022-08-18T01:59:23] Artem Bulashev: This better 0-8kmh
[2022-08-18T02:00:12] Artem Bulashev: Interesting
[2022-08-18T02:00:41] Artem Bulashev: So you did change abs phase current setting
[2022-08-18T02:00:44] Artem Bulashev: But nothing else
[2022-08-18T02:01:05] Artem Bulashev: And you did get abs error vs before you did not
[2022-08-18T02:01:25] Artem Bulashev: Interesting üßê
[2022-08-18T02:02:03] Artem Bulashev: Why would higher voltage battery cause peak phase current to go higher ? üßêüßê
[2022-08-18T02:03:23] Artem Bulashev: I know why
[2022-08-18T02:03:24] Artem Bulashev: Hahah
[2022-08-18T02:03:26] Artem Bulashev: Damm
[2022-08-18T02:03:32] Artem Bulashev: PID control!
[2022-08-18T02:04:08] Artem Bulashev: You needed to re do motor tune
[2022-08-18T02:04:42] Artem Bulashev: Pid control controls how fast changes take place
[2022-08-18T02:04:57] Artem Bulashev: P stands for Proportional
[2022-08-18T02:05:32] Artem Bulashev: At higher voltages P values on quadcopter need to be lowered to prevent over shoot and flip out
[2022-08-18T02:06:25] Artem Bulashev: So I think we were right saying ‚Äúit rumps up faster‚Äù because we get Phase current over shoot a lot higher and that‚Äôs why acceleration is better 0-8
[2022-08-18T02:07:05] Artem Bulashev: I suppose than 8-40kmh should be same
[2022-08-18T02:07:30] Artem Bulashev: If nothing charged and PID controller re obtained control after a split second over shoot
[2022-08-18T02:08:21] Artem Bulashev: True
[2022-08-18T02:08:53] Artem Bulashev: You should have hit batte try amp limit by around 20-25kmh before
[2022-08-18T02:19:36] Artem Bulashev: For absolute ?
[2022-08-18T02:20:37] Artem Bulashev: Oh phase yeah don‚Äôt remember135 phase o think on stock fw
[2022-08-18T02:20:52] Artem Bulashev: And absolute 260a I think
[2022-08-18T02:21:34] Artem Bulashev: May be 100v dual fw has lower limit than my old 75200 Ubox
[2022-08-18T02:23:13] Artem Bulashev: I think abs is around 180a max on standard
[2022-08-18T02:32:04] Artem Bulashev: Thanks yeah, I think we got somewhere today üòÅüòÅüëå good night

[2022-08-18T22:37:53] Artem Bulashev: Guys any one knows where did @SibClimb go?
[2022-08-18T22:38:48] Artem Bulashev: Texted him for past few days, no reply. He shipped vesc a while ago but didn‚Äôt give tracking and it is still no delivered - has been a lot longer than it typically takes inside EU
[2022-08-18T22:39:55] Artem Bulashev: He also said he put my email in shipping documents, but again didn‚Äôt get any notification
[2022-08-18T22:40:59] Artem Bulashev: 9 days central eu to central eu is nearly impossible time, usually 2-4 days at most
[2022-08-18T22:42:01] rosheee: Idk
[2022-08-18T22:42:08] rosheee: Also adam xD

[2022-08-19T02:27:33] Artem Bulashev: I think messages not delivered since 17th
[2022-08-19T02:28:47] Artem Bulashev: No no haha :) sure he is ok will wait for him to get back to civilization:)
[2022-08-19T07:29:01] Quinn Foster: I have this problem
[2022-08-19T09:08:13] rosheee: Whut

[2022-08-19T09:08:37] rosheee: Canbus connect?
[2022-08-19T09:21:04] Quinn Foster: Both sides of the UBOX v1 don't see each other over can
[2022-08-19T09:23:34] rosheee: U connected correct
[2022-08-19T09:24:05] rosheee: U set different vesc IDs?
[2022-08-19T09:24:17] rosheee: U set communication over can?
[2022-08-19T09:26:48] Quinn Foster: I set one to can non and the other 1234
[2022-08-19T09:27:29] Quinn Foster: I legit just reflashed fw so idk what besides default they expect.
[2022-08-19T09:28:03] rosheee: ^^
[2022-08-19T09:28:52] rosheee: what u set CAN MODE?
[2022-08-19T09:28:55] rosheee: vesc?
[2022-08-19T09:30:45] rosheee: CAN STATUS MESSAGE MODE ?
[2022-08-19T09:31:16] rosheee: on master can_status_disabled on slave ? what u set
[2022-08-19T10:07:25] rosheee: omg no manual for 7230ST üòÜhow connect these 2 mofos together over can

[2022-08-19T10:23:43] rosheee: hmm go deeper into manual
[2022-08-19T10:25:09] Quinn Foster: Just finished riding the backup board
[2022-08-19T10:25:27] rosheee: ?
[2022-08-19T10:29:47] Quinn Foster: Yeah I checked again it's all set right there
[2022-08-19T10:30:06] rosheee: send screenshots pls ^^
[2022-08-19T10:30:08] rosheee: of both escs
[2022-08-19T10:37:21] Quinn Foster: You mean of each side of the UBOX not showing any can devices
[2022-08-19T10:51:33] rosheee: configuration screen shots of ubox 1 and ubox 2
[2022-08-19T10:51:40] rosheee: u use 2x single?
[2022-08-19T10:52:00] Quinn Foster: Nope dual V1 ubox
[2022-08-19T10:52:03] rosheee: ah lol
[2022-08-19T10:52:04] rosheee: XD
[2022-08-19T10:52:07] Quinn Foster: The first batch basically
[2022-08-19T10:52:13] rosheee: then u don't have to setup can
[2022-08-19T10:52:21] Quinn Foster: Mhm
[2022-08-19T10:52:31] rosheee: it's auto
[2022-08-19T10:52:39] rosheee: no can cable needed as well üòÜ
[2022-08-19T10:52:40] rosheee: hmm
[2022-08-19T10:52:56] Quinn Foster: There's two different power switch Morse code things to input
[2022-08-19T10:53:01] Quinn Foster: I've definitely done those plenty
[2022-08-19T10:53:13] rosheee: ?
[2022-08-19T10:53:27] Quinn Foster: Normally weird stuff like this is fixed when you reflash firmware but not in this case
[2022-08-19T10:53:35] rosheee: and bootloader
[2022-08-19T10:53:48] Quinn Foster: Idk how to reset that
[2022-08-19T10:54:27] rosheee: here

[2022-08-19T10:58:25] Quinn Foster: Yeah I think this circuit is broken
[2022-08-19T10:59:01] Quinn Foster: This didn't happen randomly, it happened after I connected another UBOX via CAN

[2022-08-19T12:18:40] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: When specifying the motor poles, I need to count the magnets?
[2022-08-19T12:18:40] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: <photos/photo_5743@19-08-2022_12-18-40.jpg>
[2022-08-19T12:19:01] rosheee: yas
[2022-08-19T12:20:37] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: And not divide it by 2?
[2022-08-19T12:22:17] rosheee: no
[2022-08-19T12:35:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: not
[2022-08-19T12:36:44] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: ?
[2022-08-19T12:36:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: short the phase, rotate it, then count how much times engine jerks
[2022-08-19T12:37:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: 2 random phase are ok
[2022-08-19T12:38:09] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Ok, but it should relate to something I can count on the open motor picture...
[2022-08-19T12:39:34] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: By the way is there a way in the vesc app to tell me results of a self test ( like if the FETs are ok) ?
[2022-08-19T12:40:06] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Motor poles = X magnets Pole pairs = X/2
[2022-08-19T12:40:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: not
[2022-08-19T12:40:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: depends by stator
[2022-08-19T12:40:51] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Always works ok
[2022-08-19T12:40:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: the fastest way is count with 2 phase shorted
[2022-08-19T12:41:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: normally in escooter yes
[2022-08-19T12:41:05] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, it will be good too
[2022-08-19T12:41:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: bike not always
[2022-08-19T12:41:59] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Cause something changed and the motors detection setup doesn't work well anymore...
[2022-08-19T12:42:20] Mirono escooters: Motor poles don't care
[2022-08-19T12:42:46] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ye, used only for speed and travel calculating
[2022-08-19T13:00:27] Artem Bulashev: Oh
[2022-08-19T13:29:11] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: You know, how initially it was running ok during detection, and knocking when on throttle? I then tried swapping hall phases without improvement... now I suspect a FET is faulty already... the Vesc app should have a self diagnosis feature???
[2022-08-19T15:13:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: Sorry for that, was working in Paris then working in mountains, I texted you back
[2022-08-19T18:14:57] Luis Magalhaes: He is alive üòÇ

[2022-08-20T02:07:25] rosheee: and our cooling solution
[2022-08-20T02:07:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs made just for short time peaks
[2022-08-20T02:07:44] rosheee: 12.5kw no prob not even 50% of cont. power
[2022-08-20T02:07:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: Xd 600uf total
[2022-08-20T02:07:50] rosheee: for 2 motors üòÜ

[2022-08-20T02:13:34] rosheee: also 50 degrees vesc temp. is to high
[2022-08-20T02:13:46] rosheee: but they use 40'000rpm fans + copper heatsink and shit
[2022-08-20T02:13:47] rosheee: anyay

[2022-08-20T02:19:26] Unknown: Your case is different. My spintend works on one motor, at least I do riding everyday on it here..scammers from spintend want to pay me for repair when even fucking Chinese 60 days warranty period is not passed yet. Here they would be fucked by government if this shit Chinese company stepped in this land.
[2022-08-20T02:48:41] Artem Bulashev: amazing
[2022-08-20T02:49:06] Artem Bulashev: it should be better than best UBOX - dual 75200 red was
[2022-08-20T02:49:18] Artem Bulashev: according to the bench tests and stress tests
[2022-08-20T02:50:06] Artem Bulashev: hard to say
[2022-08-20T02:50:17] Artem Bulashev: for few runs I woudl say yes
[2022-08-20T02:50:30] Artem Bulashev: not continus
[2022-08-20T02:51:06] Artem Bulashev: well will see
[2022-08-20T02:51:24] rosheee: i've done 135A phase front + rear and 70A battery rear + 65A battery front for +20k km
[2022-08-20T02:51:33] rosheee: no issues
[2022-08-20T02:51:45] Artem Bulashev: i think with best thin thermal pad between copper and deck it may be able to do it long
[2022-08-20T02:52:05] Artem Bulashev: on which ubox?
[2022-08-20T02:52:10] rosheee: ubox v1 75V
[2022-08-20T02:52:25] rosheee: best so far
[2022-08-20T02:52:31] Artem Bulashev: yeah for sure
[2022-08-20T02:52:33] rosheee: better than 100v 75v2 and else
[2022-08-20T02:52:45] Artem Bulashev: yeap
[2022-08-20T02:52:45] rosheee: even changed thermalpads cuz @Happy_Giraffe XD
[2022-08-20T02:52:56] rosheee: then asked spintend to send me their originals teh pls
[2022-08-20T02:52:56] Artem Bulashev: and this one should be better than v1, slightly because fets are 100v higher IR, but cooling is that much better
[2022-08-20T02:53:16] rosheee: v1 beta version üòú
[2022-08-20T02:57:40] Artem Bulashev: I should get 100v UBOX singles this week a pair - if you decide you want to buy those I can ship them locally - I don‚Äôt need them right now, so i can order them again and wait
[2022-08-20T02:58:10] rosheee: nah i stay ubox v1 until it dies
[2022-08-20T02:58:15] rosheee: had 100v beta
[2022-08-20T02:58:18] rosheee: 75v v2 beta
[2022-08-20T02:58:30] rosheee: but kept v1
[2022-08-20T03:21:26] Artem Bulashev: Doesn‚Äôt really work with connectors as on ubox
[2022-08-20T03:46:57] Luis Magalhaes: Always pushing it?
[2022-08-20T03:51:58] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-08-20T03:52:12] rosheee: ubox v1? always
[2022-08-20T03:52:18] rosheee: next tuesday with new battery
[2022-08-20T03:52:19] rosheee: all new
[2022-08-20T03:52:24] rosheee: new fuckeria
[2022-08-20T03:52:26] rosheee: more amperia

[2022-08-20T17:12:50] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: What would this BMS do, to interrupt an overcurrent condition at >260A?
[2022-08-20T17:13:03] rosheee: idk
[2022-08-20T17:14:01] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-08-20T17:14:02] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Die if you do, die if you don't..
[2022-08-20T17:15:25] Artem Bulashev: Close fets
[2022-08-20T17:20:39] rosheee: what
[2022-08-20T17:29:52] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Indeed it would have to have an extra set of FET to short out the external circuit... According to the law of induction you can not simply interrupt a current without the inductance insisting on the current and if necessary increasing the voltage till it creates new conduction...
[2022-08-20T17:30:52] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Which is the trick on regenerative braking...
[2022-08-20T17:33:41] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: There are probably no significant snubber capacitors either... Actually if you love your BMS and think it could need to ever interrupt such current add a fat capacitor...
[2022-08-20T18:07:55] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: To my knowledge BMS have two parallel FET banks, in order to overcome the body diode problem, but to my knowledge they don't have FET to take out the inductive reaction energy out there...
[2022-08-20T18:08:38] sombre_enfant: @artBula short big jk bms in video
[2022-08-20T18:10:52] Mirono escooters: How so "take out" Dissapeated in heat
[2022-08-20T18:11:01] Mirono escooters: And smaller caps
[2022-08-20T19:02:02] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: I had published some alternative ideas for redundant fault tolerant BMS years ago: https://prezi.com/qibqej3sqqy1/open-source-battery/
[2022-08-20T19:17:53] Artem Bulashev: I have shorted circuited and reset my JKBms 15 times in 2h
[2022-08-20T19:17:58] Artem Bulashev: No issues
[2022-08-20T19:22:14] Artem Bulashev: Charging was disabled why discharge was on -> that caused over voltage protection on VESC when it built up to 75v regen that could not go to battery -> that OV on vesc shut vesc into Dort circuit -> BMS reacted faster than vesc and cut power -> that cause vesc to reset OV and than go to Under voltage protection = slight short circuite as that how it tests voltage in case it comes back up high. BMS would not reset as short circutr was detected during vesc Low Voltage protection. Running with scooter increased voltage high enough through phases on VESC = vesc than can be turn on without stopping and than battery SC protection also gets reset and you can drive again. That happened 15 times in 2h :)
[2022-08-20T19:22:47] Artem Bulashev: That is not same as OC protection but I‚Äôm sure it can handle it well if set accordingly
[2022-08-20T20:05:46] rosheee: D
[2022-08-20T20:05:47] rosheee: XD
[2022-08-20T21:34:15] Artem Bulashev: I would not trust FlipSky in the air ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

[2022-08-20T21:34:55] Artem Bulashev: Unless you are above forest or water
[2022-08-20T21:35:09] Mirono escooters: Id trust flipsky
[2022-08-20T21:35:11] Mirono escooters: But thats me
[2022-08-20T21:35:25] Artem Bulashev: May be that one model
[2022-08-20T21:35:34] Mirono escooters: 75100 sure

[2022-08-20T22:36:49] Luis Magalhaes: If it was cheaper üëÄ, great job anyways üëåüëå
[2022-08-20T23:21:25] Konstantin: Even If gasoline, and u fly under water, when something go wrong 90%+ u a dead ;)
[2022-08-21T00:32:15] Artem Bulashev: Fair point. But gasoline is fully analog system. You can fully inspect it for flaws, if doesn‚Äôt glitch or die for no reason or suddenly - it is always a development like oil liking for a while and than engine braking
[2022-08-21T00:33:19] Artem Bulashev: I just think that I would trust basic controller more than overly complex for the task controller. Though maybe FOC has efficiency gains there as well
[2022-08-21T00:40:54] Mirono escooters: Ehh oil can fail ffom nothing
[2022-08-21T00:41:08] Mirono escooters: Idk, basic isn't engineered well either
[2022-08-21T00:41:21] Mirono escooters: Buttt id have a backup controller surely
[2022-08-21T01:00:34] Artem Bulashev: Wonder I that is possible to hook up to controllers at once to one motor and one battery, but only drive one of them at the time - without other circuitry
[2022-08-21T01:07:37] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: I think it would be ok, especially if only one of them was turned on at a time (ignition hack) or at least only one had throttle signal at a time...
[2022-08-21T01:08:03] Mirono escooters: Yes only 1 on at time
[2022-08-21T01:23:53] Artem Bulashev: Not possible
[2022-08-21T01:24:51] Artem Bulashev: Second one will turn on because motor voltage will make its way back to the second controller via phase wires and will be able to power up second controller, just like in regen
[2022-08-21T01:25:25] Artem Bulashev: I think so at least
[2022-08-21T01:25:41] Artem Bulashev: May be wrong but that would be my expectation
[2022-08-21T01:27:36] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: I said ignition hack...

[2022-08-21T21:06:17] Artem Bulashev: It must eat those 1.5kWh super fast lol
[2022-08-21T21:06:52] Artem Bulashev: Any one knows what are contorller ratings ?
[2022-08-21T21:19:38] Artem Bulashev: And Nami controllers how many amps rated?
[2022-08-21T21:22:29] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Gt2? 30a battery per motor. 60A peak from battery, summed. Maybe around 100-120A per motor phase when accelerates in race+boost mode
[2022-08-21T21:22:52] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Controller officially rated at 60a, thats all
[2022-08-21T21:25:05] Artem Bulashev: Sure ? That‚Äôs less than VSETT10+, phases are not controlled on those controllers
[2022-08-21T21:25:27] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Phase?
[2022-08-21T21:26:05] Artem Bulashev: Unlimited, peaks likely around 145a
[2022-08-21T21:26:14] Artem Bulashev: Impossible to tell
[2022-08-21T21:26:23] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Thats different algorithms and great code i think
[2022-08-21T21:26:26] Artem Bulashev: Only comparing to vesc configuration
[2022-08-21T21:26:27] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: High efficiency
[2022-08-21T21:26:57] Artem Bulashev: It is higher frequency controller - that is why vsetts are quite, emulated Sinewave
[2022-08-21T21:27:14] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Gt2 has 15kHz pwm
[2022-08-21T21:27:33] Artem Bulashev: If gt2 is has 30a only than it will have slower acceleration
[2022-08-21T21:27:46] Artem Bulashev: But battery is 72v?
[2022-08-21T21:27:59] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: And when you ride it it sileneter than noctua fans
[2022-08-21T21:28:07] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-08-21T21:28:13] Artem Bulashev: Can‚Äôt hear it
[2022-08-21T21:28:16] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 52v (14s)
[2022-08-21T21:28:22] Artem Bulashev: What
[2022-08-21T21:28:37] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: S-1X also has 14s
[2022-08-21T21:28:37] Artem Bulashev: Gt2 is 52v
[2022-08-21T21:28:46] Artem Bulashev: No way
[2022-08-21T21:29:13] Artem Bulashev: Damm
[2022-08-21T21:29:13] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, it is. The battery building is lit and from another planet in comparing
[2022-08-21T21:29:17] Artem Bulashev: That is low voltage
[2022-08-21T21:29:31] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: And static 65-70 kmh till 30%
[2022-08-21T21:29:31] Artem Bulashev: That means high KV motor
[2022-08-21T21:29:57] Artem Bulashev: That mean lower torque acceleration at lower end
[2022-08-21T21:30:13] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But depends on software limits from official upgrades of fw
[2022-08-21T21:30:14] Artem Bulashev: So it is optimized for top speed and not acceleration
[2022-08-21T21:30:43] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Tha acceleration the same as thunder 2
[2022-08-21T21:30:48] Artem Bulashev: VSETT 10+ is 60v battery and 72kmh max top speed
[2022-08-21T21:30:57] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Im already talked about this earlier
[2022-08-21T21:31:04] Artem Bulashev: Thunder 2 is slower acceleration yeah
[2022-08-21T21:31:07] Artem Bulashev: Ok got it
[2022-08-21T21:31:10] Artem Bulashev: Thanks for info
[2022-08-21T21:31:50] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Segway overall not about fastest and high acceleration
[2022-08-21T21:32:53] Artem Bulashev: Actually I have not seen thunder 2 vs 10+
[2022-08-21T21:32:58] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: The building, the geometry (thats the safest 70 kmh in your life on this scooter) and 200+ pages on passing certifications and tests
[2022-08-21T21:33:04] Artem Bulashev: Only thunder 1 vs 10+
[2022-08-21T21:33:21] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Gt2 has biiig trail lenght
[2022-08-21T21:33:42] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Its like cruiser around motorcycles
[2022-08-21T21:34:00] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-08-21T21:34:04] Artem Bulashev: It‚Äôs huge
[2022-08-21T21:34:37] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You can ride 60+ kmh without one hand and make turns, no problem. Like real
[2022-08-21T21:35:18] Artem Bulashev: I honestly don‚Äôt like concept of big and heavy scooter with higher top speed but lower acceleration. I‚Äôm also against going 60+ kmh on escooters
[2022-08-21T21:35:47] Mirono escooters: Yess
[2022-08-21T21:35:56] Mirono escooters: High accel>high speed
[2022-08-21T21:36:03] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Agreed
[2022-08-21T21:36:10] Artem Bulashev: Yeah that is fork / axis geometry, VSETT did not get it well. Glad to see they got front axis in leading position
[2022-08-21T21:36:17] Artem Bulashev: Agree
[2022-08-21T21:36:32] Mirono escooters: Boring acceling 1 min lol, wanna shooot off
[2022-08-21T21:36:34] Artem Bulashev: Hope that will become trend
[2022-08-21T21:37:10] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes!
[2022-08-21T21:37:22] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Is a must. More safety
[2022-08-21T21:38:41] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Or you will get this like no problem. Gt1/Gt2 doesnt know whats wobble no more
[2022-08-21T21:38:44] Artem Bulashev: Yeah self centering physics
[2022-08-21T21:40:05] Mirono escooters: Oof thats just bad

[2022-08-21T21:43:40] Artem Bulashev: Yeah that‚Äôs fine but they were caught miss measuring top speed / acceleration of some scooters - DT and Earlier Kaboo had them paid to pose their scooters as better once than others.

[2022-08-21T22:25:17] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, the battery in gt2 is working at nominal peak values. 3kw peak. 60A from 52v battery. Each motor gets limited to 3kw per motor phase watts
[2022-08-21T22:25:46] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Its the same as all others

[2022-08-21T22:26:17] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: And only in race+boost mode and from aggressive start from 0
[2022-08-21T22:27:09] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: If this logic, than roschee gets 20kw from battery, when he is showing screens

[2022-08-21T22:40:02] rosheee: size
[2022-08-21T22:40:34] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Hmm, m365tools telling no more than 60A from battery. Maybe it cant produce real measurements yet. Official segways docs said esc is 60A. Battery is 14s12p. So, for 6kw very very peak needs ~115A 52v. So 2 escs is doing 60A battery per wheel then. And only on lower speeds the phase amps is getting higher then batteries, but i dont know how much phase here. I guess its around 120-130A, in comparing to vesc configs on dualtrons projects etc
[2022-08-21T22:40:35] Artem Bulashev: Strong frame and good suspention and good wheel size with great acceleration for stock, good high speed, and huge battery

[2022-08-21T23:00:37] Artem Bulashev: And amp limit settings ? I think 140a total?
[2022-08-21T23:00:41] Luis Magalhaes: if they dont burn its ok for him hahaha
[2022-08-21T23:01:04] Artem Bulashev: 40t can take abuse
[2022-08-21T23:01:10] sombre_enfant: P42
[2022-08-21T23:01:11] Artem Bulashev: 6p will be ok
[2022-08-21T23:01:17] Artem Bulashev: Basically same
[2022-08-21T23:01:23] Artem Bulashev: Heat map is identical

[2022-08-21T23:02:59] rosheee: idk why motors or system cuts at 110-120
[2022-08-21T23:03:28] Artem Bulashev: 50s is similar heat up to p42a at 20a
[2022-08-21T23:03:32] Artem Bulashev: Abit worse
[2022-08-21T23:03:47] Artem Bulashev: Continues yes
[2022-08-21T23:03:56] Artem Bulashev: Amps
[2022-08-21T23:04:17] Artem Bulashev: At 35a t they over heat with in 5min to critical
[2022-08-21T23:04:22] rosheee: kmh
[2022-08-21T23:04:25] rosheee: no error
[2022-08-21T23:04:26] Artem Bulashev: But good luck doing that load for 5min non stop unless high way or 3p lol
[2022-08-21T23:04:32] rosheee: ah no prob
[2022-08-21T23:04:39] rosheee: idk

[2022-08-21T23:06:27] rosheee: 16s faster top speed with bit FW
[2022-08-21T23:06:30] rosheee: like + 35A fw
[2022-08-21T23:06:31] Artem Bulashev: Looks like Duty cycle limit
[2022-08-21T23:06:34] Artem Bulashev: Bellow 95%
[2022-08-21T23:06:39] rosheee: i set 96

[2022-08-21T23:07:02] Artem Bulashev: If it is same
[2022-08-21T23:07:06] Artem Bulashev: Should have same top speed
[2022-08-21T23:07:09] rosheee: ubox 16S 135A phase max 180A current motormax
[2022-08-21T23:07:12] Artem Bulashev: On gps
[2022-08-21T23:07:15] rosheee: 20s without fw = 91kmh
[2022-08-21T23:07:38] rosheee: BUT
[2022-08-21T23:07:44] rosheee: dude
[2022-08-21T23:07:45] Artem Bulashev: 180a phas you mean peak phase on logs?
[2022-08-21T23:07:52] rosheee: XD OMG

[2022-08-21T23:10:10] rosheee: BUT
[2022-08-21T23:10:16] Artem Bulashev: That‚Äôs too much for vsett motor
[2022-08-21T23:10:21] Artem Bulashev: And Rion vesc I suspect
[2022-08-21T23:10:24] rosheee: no

[2022-08-21T23:11:03] rosheee: yes ^^'
[2022-08-21T23:12:14] Artem Bulashev: 250a phase with 90a battery on rear wheel of 10+ should not be possible to control
[2022-08-21T23:12:22] rosheee: why?
[2022-08-21T23:12:26] Artem Bulashev: üòÇüòÇ

[2022-08-21T23:13:09] Luis Magalhaes: whats the specs on that machine ?
[2022-08-21T23:13:47] Artem Bulashev: You can be slower if you have anti slip on
[2022-08-21T23:13:56] Artem Bulashev: Because motor constantly shuts off
[2022-08-21T23:14:02] rosheee: i fixed at 250a battery
[2022-08-21T23:14:02] Artem Bulashev: Both front and rear

[2022-08-21T23:15:20] rosheee: on bms
[2022-08-21T23:15:41] Artem Bulashev: So no anti slip?
[2022-08-21T23:15:53] Artem Bulashev: What is top speed on 16s battery Ubox ?
[2022-08-21T23:16:07] rosheee: over 100
[2022-08-21T23:16:11] Artem Bulashev: 72kmh should be
[2022-08-21T23:16:15] Artem Bulashev: Wait what

[2022-08-21T23:16:29] Artem Bulashev: Man VSETT 10+ motor
[2022-08-21T23:16:48] Artem Bulashev: At full 16s dual motor goes 72kmh max on square wave original controller 100% duty
[2022-08-21T23:17:00] rosheee: here
[2022-08-21T23:17:06] Artem Bulashev: It‚Äôs incorrect
[2022-08-21T23:17:10] Artem Bulashev: It doesn‚Äôt do it
[2022-08-21T23:17:12] Artem Bulashev: It can‚Äôt
[2022-08-21T23:17:24] Artem Bulashev: Calculate KV of motor vs voltage of battery
[2022-08-21T23:17:31] Artem Bulashev: It is physically impossible
[2022-08-21T23:17:40] rosheee: not
[2022-08-21T23:17:42] rosheee: so gps also
[2022-08-21T23:17:42] Artem Bulashev: Unless you do magic with vesc ‚Äú Nitro Boost‚Äù

[2022-08-21T23:18:30] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2022-08-21T23:18:41] Artem Bulashev: Because without it will only do 70-72kmh
[2022-08-21T23:18:43] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 96% duty is frozen already at 70
[2022-08-21T23:18:47] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: look
[2022-08-21T23:18:58] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: so fw, yes

[2022-08-21T23:19:09] rosheee: bitches
[2022-08-21T23:19:48] Artem Bulashev: Do you do Field aweskening on Rion?
[2022-08-21T23:20:21] Artem Bulashev: Look 1S adds 3-6kmh
[2022-08-21T23:20:36] rosheee: 16S
[2022-08-21T23:20:40] Artem Bulashev: So 20s should do +24KMH MAX = 94kmh give it take
[2022-08-21T23:20:41] rosheee: lol
[2022-08-21T23:20:53] rosheee: after stuck at 117kmh i put 110A FW front + rear
[2022-08-21T23:21:14] rosheee: omg sad 5P
[2022-08-21T23:21:52] Artem Bulashev: With field weakening sure
[2022-08-21T23:21:53] rosheee: lol
[2022-08-21T23:22:01] rosheee: yah
[2022-08-21T23:22:02] Artem Bulashev: It emulates Higher KV motor

[2022-08-21T23:22:36] rosheee: I DO 110A FW ON RION
[2022-08-21T23:22:44] Artem Bulashev: I don‚Äôt know what it is
[2022-08-21T23:22:53] rosheee: never tested field weakening?
[2022-08-21T23:22:58] Artem Bulashev: Nope
[2022-08-21T23:23:07] rosheee: check the video
[2022-08-21T23:23:34] rosheee: there still high wattage at high speecdx
[2022-08-21T23:23:36] Artem Bulashev: Wihtout field weakening how much top speed?!
[2022-08-21T23:23:41] rosheee: idk
[2022-08-21T23:23:46] Artem Bulashev: On Rion

[2022-08-21T23:24:57] rosheee: 100A battery
[2022-08-21T23:25:00] Artem Bulashev: How much top speed with field weakening on Rion?
[2022-08-21T23:25:10] rosheee: so far
[2022-08-21T23:25:17] rosheee: something cuts at 117
[2022-08-21T23:25:19] Face de Pin Suc√©: I never saw a Rion reaching more than 125Kmh
[2022-08-21T23:25:30] Artem Bulashev: So it is faster than ubox
[2022-08-21T23:25:37] Artem Bulashev: No mastery
[2022-08-21T23:25:46] Artem Bulashev: What was the point than you made?

[2022-08-21T23:27:09] rosheee: 55 degrees with 20kw peak in closed frame is to hot they say
[2022-08-21T23:27:19] rosheee: at 35C degrees ambient
[2022-08-21T23:27:33] rosheee: and we don't use 40'000rpm fans + copper + blablbalal
[2022-08-21T23:27:34] Face de Pin Suc√©: I've run 143Kmh on my small 20S setup ^^
[2022-08-21T23:27:35] Artem Bulashev: But you push a lot more the Rion, of course it heats up more, what you expect?
[2022-08-21T23:27:40] rosheee: send sc000ter
[2022-08-21T23:27:47] rosheee: lol

[2022-08-21T23:31:06] rosheee: dis discko
[2022-08-21T23:31:16] Artem Bulashev: That‚Äôs bull shit
[2022-08-21T23:31:17] rosheee: then whe need @SibClimb esc
[2022-08-21T23:31:24] rosheee: i think so as well
[2022-08-21T23:31:28] rosheee: maybe temp. sensor not g00d
[2022-08-21T23:31:33] rosheee: but battery wasn't warm
[2022-08-21T23:31:41] Artem Bulashev: Temp inside deck is higher
[2022-08-21T23:31:42] rosheee: sometimes my motors are below ambient temp üòú
[2022-08-21T23:31:45] Face de Pin Suc√©: also here
[2022-08-21T23:31:57] rosheee: we need the video by night
[2022-08-21T23:31:59] Artem Bulashev: With 300a phase ?
[2022-08-21T23:32:01] Artem Bulashev: ü§£ü§£
[2022-08-21T23:32:10] rosheee: 300A each
[2022-08-21T23:32:21] Face de Pin Suc√©: don't remember where it is x) lemme search
[2022-08-21T23:32:23] Artem Bulashev: My point exactly
[2022-08-21T23:32:38] rosheee: üòú no the motors are fcking hot ^^'
[2022-08-21T23:32:44] rosheee: and the amps is for both escs
[2022-08-21T23:33:17] rosheee: pushing over 200A phase on 1 motor
[2022-08-21T23:33:50] rosheee: this my phase amps of 1 motor ^^'
[2022-08-21T23:34:33] rosheee: this is 20S phase for 1 motor
[2022-08-21T23:34:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: Hahaha Dualtron Compact Rage Mechanics
[2022-08-21T23:35:13] rosheee: this also 20s and 1 motor if pushing 200A on rear then g00d luck

[2022-08-21T23:37:21] rosheee: lol no
[2022-08-21T23:37:21] Artem Bulashev: What
[2022-08-21T23:37:24] Artem Bulashev: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2022-08-21T23:37:34] Artem Bulashev: Man I do more phase amp on my VSETT9
[2022-08-21T23:37:34] rosheee: what?
[2022-08-21T23:37:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: I was laughing with adrenalin and stress üòÅüòÅ
[2022-08-21T23:37:41] rosheee: yes this is 1 motor
[2022-08-21T23:37:48] rosheee: but it spinns
[2022-08-21T23:37:56] rosheee: but this is front motor ^^'
[2022-08-21T23:37:59] Artem Bulashev: That makes no sense
[2022-08-21T23:38:01] rosheee: why?
[2022-08-21T23:38:15] rosheee: i do 250A phase amps
[2022-08-21T23:38:18] rosheee: 100A front 150A rear
[2022-08-21T23:38:23] Artem Bulashev: Ohh
[2022-08-21T23:38:28] Artem Bulashev: I though you show rear
[2022-08-21T23:38:28] rosheee: <photos/photo_5798@21-08-2022_23-38-28.jpg>
[2022-08-21T23:38:32] rosheee: idk
[2022-08-21T23:38:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: Oh that's okay
[2022-08-21T23:38:35] Artem Bulashev: Why only 100a front ?
[2022-08-21T23:38:38] rosheee: IDK
[2022-08-21T23:38:41] rosheee: I SET 250 XD
[2022-08-21T23:38:45] Face de Pin Suc√©: You won't explod any mosfets then
[2022-08-21T23:38:50] rosheee: AND IF U PUSH THROTTLE MAX then it spinns
[2022-08-21T23:38:56] rosheee: front + rear
[2022-08-21T23:39:01] rosheee: this is WHY I ASK
[2022-08-21T23:39:06] rosheee: HOW CAN PUSH 200A REAR MOTOR XD?
[2022-08-21T23:39:09] Artem Bulashev: Never mind
[2022-08-21T23:39:14] Artem Bulashev: It brakes it
[2022-08-21T23:39:18] Artem Bulashev: Anti slip
[2022-08-21T23:39:28] rosheee: antislip
[2022-08-21T23:39:32] Artem Bulashev: That‚Äôs why it is 100->0
[2022-08-21T23:40:03] rosheee: at least he also achieved same speed
[2022-08-21T23:40:05] rosheee: 117.4821 kmh
[2022-08-21T23:40:07] rosheee: with 20s
[2022-08-21T23:40:10] Artem Bulashev: üëç
[2022-08-21T23:40:29] rosheee: ok
[2022-08-21T23:40:32] rosheee: i go for a short spin now
[2022-08-21T23:40:35] rosheee: and connect to rear esc
[2022-08-21T23:40:35] Artem Bulashev: 180a phase rear is very nice and high on 19s
[2022-08-21T23:40:42] Artem Bulashev: What is Abs on rear?
[2022-08-21T23:40:44] rosheee: and take logfile
[2022-08-21T23:40:50] rosheee: yah ^'^' omg
[2022-08-21T23:41:13] rosheee: XD
[2022-08-21T23:41:35] rosheee: BUIT @SibClimb U HAVE TO SEND MORE PORN
[2022-08-21T23:41:37] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2022-08-21T23:41:42] rosheee: mr. keep it secret
[2022-08-21T23:41:48] Artem Bulashev: I can give you few great lights
[2022-08-21T23:41:54] Artem Bulashev: Links
[2022-08-21T23:42:32] rosheee: Adam DID your motors cut @73mph?
[2022-08-21T23:42:46] rosheee: cuz that is exactly where i have problems atm
[2022-08-21T23:43:18] Artem Bulashev: Best light pattern i found - didn‚Äôt test yet watt output though https://a.aliexpress.com/_DdKUgNd
[2022-08-21T23:43:55] Artem Bulashev: Potentially best all in one (close beam and high beam) - have not tested watt output https://a.aliexpress.com/_DDTJU59 Great SIZE! 2 of those will be smaller than most lights!
[2022-08-21T23:44:31] rosheee: if u want compact good light with REAL LM's...then fenix
[2022-08-21T23:45:02] Jan: Absolute psycho üòÇ
[2022-08-21T23:45:11] rosheee: he has 11"
[2022-08-21T23:45:18] rosheee: and suc√© driver he is
[2022-08-21T23:45:56] Artem Bulashev: Need lower I can make a 3d print mount bar for them
[2022-08-21T23:46:47] rosheee: Guys
[2022-08-21T23:46:49] rosheee: 1 question
[2022-08-21T23:46:50] Artem Bulashev: Owls - actually only 17.5w from my test :( not bad but expected more https://a.aliexpress.com/_DkKM6KJ
[2022-08-21T23:47:07] rosheee: Front ESC shows different max peak power than rear
[2022-08-21T23:47:17] rosheee: How dis can be?
[2022-08-21T23:47:26] rosheee: Like 200-300w difference
[2022-08-21T23:47:32] Artem Bulashev: Battery amp you mean ?
[2022-08-21T23:47:41] Artem Bulashev: Of course because it consumes less
[2022-08-21T23:47:42] Jan: Out of context that would sound so wrong üòÖ
[2022-08-21T23:47:45] Artem Bulashev: Less phase
[2022-08-21T23:48:03] rosheee: Do frotn shows 20kw and rear 20.2kw
[2022-08-21T23:48:08] rosheee: So i have 20kw per wheel?
[2022-08-21T23:48:15] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-08-21T23:48:25] rosheee: Yup
[2022-08-21T23:48:25] Artem Bulashev: Remember phase * motor voltage must equal to = battery voltage * XX amps
[2022-08-21T23:48:42] rosheee: But why different values?
[2022-08-21T23:48:52] Artem Bulashev: Oh total
[2022-08-21T23:49:02] rosheee: Yes
[2022-08-21T23:49:05] rosheee: Total is different
[2022-08-21T23:49:12] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-08-21T23:49:18] Artem Bulashev: 1%
[2022-08-21T23:49:22] Artem Bulashev: It‚Äôs ok
[2022-08-21T23:50:00] Artem Bulashev: Many vesc have voltage measurement off by a significant amount
[2022-08-21T23:50:44] Artem Bulashev: I found BMS to be inaccurate often
[2022-08-21T23:50:47] Artem Bulashev: On amps
[2022-08-21T23:50:54] Artem Bulashev: But voltage very good
[2022-08-21T23:50:59] Artem Bulashev: Vesc opposite
[2022-08-21T23:51:09] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2022-08-21T23:51:56] Artem Bulashev: Because it doesn‚Äôt care that much about voltage precision, unlike BMS, and BMS doesn‚Äôt care that much about amps measurement accuracy. So circuitry is designed accordingly
[2022-08-21T23:52:37] Artem Bulashev: That seems excessive
[2022-08-21T23:53:00] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2022-08-21T23:53:13] Artem Bulashev: So do that
[2022-08-21T23:53:27] Artem Bulashev: I guess you got batch before they implemented fix
[2022-08-21T23:53:37] Artem Bulashev: I will ask John
[2022-08-21T23:53:51] Artem Bulashev: On newer batch those are soldered
[2022-08-21T23:54:07] Artem Bulashev: They broke it to separate grounds but it didn‚Äôt work as expected
[2022-08-21T23:54:27] Artem Bulashev: It was supposed to improve isolation
[2022-08-21T23:54:28] rosheee: Suce light

[2022-08-21T23:55:04] Artem Bulashev: Where?
[2022-08-21T23:55:13] Artem Bulashev: Hall in Ubox?
[2022-08-21T23:55:23] Artem Bulashev: Ohh
[2022-08-21T23:55:25] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2022-08-21T23:55:43] Artem Bulashev: It‚Äôs not hall sensor though
[2022-08-21T23:56:00] Artem Bulashev: Shunt resistor
[2022-08-21T23:56:39] Artem Bulashev: Hall sensor is in throttle and can be used in wireless current measuring devices
[2022-08-21T23:57:01] Artem Bulashev: I see
[2022-08-21T23:57:06] Artem Bulashev: I had issue on 5.02
[2022-08-21T23:57:13] Artem Bulashev: But never on 5.3
[2022-08-21T23:57:19] rosheee: <photos/photo_5800@21-08-2022_23-57-19.jpg>
[2022-08-21T23:57:40] Artem Bulashev: Damm
[2022-08-21T23:57:52] Artem Bulashev: Oh
[2022-08-21T23:57:57] Artem Bulashev: Those are not shunt
[2022-08-21T23:58:02] Artem Bulashev: Those are just resistors
[2022-08-21T23:58:03] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2022-08-21T23:58:15] Artem Bulashev: Sort of like filtering
[2022-08-21T23:58:23] Artem Bulashev: Intersting
[2022-08-21T23:58:30] Artem Bulashev: They were not well soldered?
[2022-08-21T23:58:47] Face de Pin Suc√©: <sticker>
[2022-08-21T23:58:57] Artem Bulashev: Shit true
[2022-08-21T23:59:04] Artem Bulashev: Good to know
[2022-08-21T23:59:15] Artem Bulashev: Will be watching out as well during inspection
[2022-08-21T23:59:28] Artem Bulashev: üëåüëå
[2022-08-21T23:59:32] Artem Bulashev: I bet good job

[2022-08-22T00:45:20] rosheee: How warm battery?
[2022-08-22T00:45:35] rosheee: I record tomorrow morning daly
[2022-08-22T00:52:22] Mirko Boni: good evening everyone, the 4mm phase connectors already installed in the ubox can be fine or should they be replaced with 6.5mm connectors?
[2022-08-22T00:54:27] Luis Magalhaes: 30¬∫ max i think
[2022-08-22T01:09:54] Luis Magalhaes: have to check it more carefully
[2022-08-22T01:48:08] Mirko Boni: I could get to 120A
[2022-08-22T21:30:56] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: No idea what to look for...
[2022-08-22T21:59:40] Mirko Boni: Thanks james
[2022-08-22T22:02:55] Mirko Boni: I have the 6.5mm gold plated connectors! Better to mount those?
[2022-08-22T22:05:04] Artem Bulashev: No
[2022-08-22T22:05:08] Artem Bulashev: They don‚Äôt
[2022-08-22T22:05:15] Artem Bulashev: May be avaible on website
[2022-08-22T22:05:25] Artem Bulashev: If not will ask them to add
[2022-08-22T23:40:34] Mirko Boni: No no it is not included! I have to buy the other part!
[2022-08-22T23:41:12] Mirko Boni: To save money! üòÇüòÇüòÇ

[2022-08-23T00:25:16] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Nice one
[2022-08-23T08:17:25] Unknown: I asked for xt150 when did order, these scammers refused, so I did soldering xt150 myself, anyway AS150 is much better, I mean more secure when soldered, I ordered ones for my next controller
[2022-08-23T08:23:43] Federico77: As150 are anti spark üëç
[2022-08-23T08:25:11] Unknown: Yes(for positive part, red color only) but when you do soldering it is more convenient to solder wire in it and less chance if soldering was not good to fall out the wire as it happened with xt150
[2022-08-23T08:27:39] Federico77: I've never had an As150 in my hand, I trust what you say. üëç
[2022-08-23T08:28:02] Unknown: On YouTube you can find videos for both connectors
[2022-08-23T08:28:38] Federico77: I'm going to see, but already from the photo you understand what you say is correct
[2022-08-23T08:29:43] Mirono escooters: Stop it, no one doing free labour and free connectors for your assüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2022-08-23T08:30:54] Unknown: Shut up yourself, chinesium defender, I am wondering how much they pay you(do discounts) to protect them
[2022-08-23T08:31:10] Mirono escooters: Lmao

[2022-08-23T09:15:20] Artem Bulashev: There is 0 reason to use anti spark on Phase wires
[2022-08-23T09:15:40] Artem Bulashev: Getting same filling, but blocking him for his opinion is not really good way to go about
[2022-08-23T09:15:59] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2022-08-23T09:21:21] Unknown: And it got broken inside THEIR 60 days warranty period!
[2022-08-23T09:22:51] Mirono escooters: Rofl and you dont wanna send it back bcs of some made up bs About that they keep itü§°
[2022-08-23T09:23:24] Unknown: Mate, just out if you don't understand English

[2022-08-23T09:23:46] Mirono escooters: Says the guy who cant read mails and makes up stuff

[2022-08-23T09:24:38] Mirono escooters: Man problably killed his vesc and doesnt wanna send it back bcs he knows he did it üòÇüòÇ
[2022-08-23T09:24:40] Unknown: I don't need anyone on "my side". Just aware people of average Chinese seller, and how they deal inside warranty period.
[2022-08-23T09:24:52] Mirono escooters: Ahahahahahaha, sure buddy
[2022-08-23T09:25:07] Mirono escooters: Makes up stuff, shits on hard working chineses with bs
[2022-08-23T09:26:35] Mirono escooters: I cant stand people who try to destroy a hard working business, without any evidence. Worst people. People trying to make a living, small business. And entitled idiots like you spread made up shit. As a business myself, you guys are the worst. And i can not stand that, its not fair. This is my last message, you are not worth it.
[2022-08-23T10:20:52] Artem Bulashev: What happened with it?
[2022-08-23T10:21:09] Artem Bulashev: Why you think it was a defect ?
[2022-08-23T10:22:23] Artem Bulashev: I had one vesc fail with in first week, I collected evidence- like photo of solder balls inside (it was old assembly before they fixed it) and they repaired / replaced it for free
[2022-08-23T10:24:04] Unknown: As this Amy from spintend wrote to me, it is their CPU failed. ESCB part has no lights on LEDs and Vcc on SWD connector is 0.7V when it has to be 3.3V
[2022-08-23T10:24:40] Artem Bulashev: That actually sounds like dc-dc fail
[2022-08-23T10:24:45] Artem Bulashev: And not mcu
[2022-08-23T10:24:56] Artem Bulashev: Which usually happens because of wrong connection
[2022-08-23T10:25:03] Artem Bulashev: 99.9% of the time
[2022-08-23T10:25:14] Unknown: I don't know..these words of this Amy
[2022-08-23T10:25:31] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I would conclude same as they did from my experience
[2022-08-23T10:25:37] Mirono escooters: Or pulling too much current, but comes down to same thing
[2022-08-23T10:26:05] Artem Bulashev: 3.3v LTO dais normally from wrong connection, very hard for it to Fail on its own - breathy impossible
[2022-08-23T10:26:22] Artem Bulashev: Unless there was a solder ball
[2022-08-23T10:26:24] Artem Bulashev: That short it
[2022-08-23T10:26:52] Artem Bulashev: Any what they are correct to suspect it was not defect so you should send it to be inspected and repaired
[2022-08-23T10:27:06] Artem Bulashev: Only than they can tell if it was defect or user error
[2022-08-23T10:27:13] Unknown: Escb port Vcc has 3.3V, only SWD Vcc has voltage drop so noway for me to flash firmware or how it is usually get fixed
[2022-08-23T10:27:14] Mirono escooters: Yes, its normal to suspect you killed it :)
[2022-08-23T10:28:46] Artem Bulashev: Sounds like you have burned component so they would have to reflow new mcu and likely 3.3v circuitry
[2022-08-23T10:29:02] Artem Bulashev: Like LDO
[2022-08-23T10:29:18] Artem Bulashev: There are guys in EU who do repairs as well
[2022-08-23T10:30:23] Unknown: How could I burnt it if I have never touched their controller before it get broken, I mean I didn't try these firmwares, I rided on their old 5.2 firmware
[2022-08-23T10:31:18] Unknown: And this trip was very short, half kilometer under 80kg load
[2022-08-23T11:35:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Somehow it was connected together, so you must have touched it ü§∑As was said above if there was something connected bad ,even half km is a lot Not saying to talk against you ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ

[2022-08-24T11:56:19] Jan: Im glad im not in customer support business
[2022-08-24T11:56:35] Mirono escooters: Im still voting for ban :)
[2022-08-24T11:57:05] Mirono escooters: But be careful, his gov will fuck them if they come to his landüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2022-08-24T11:57:19] Mirono escooters: Man thinks hes a dictator
[2022-08-24T11:57:33] Mirono escooters: Pin dat, lets see
[2022-08-24T11:57:49] Mirono escooters: Before you vote, read his msg and his proffesional email first

[2022-08-24T11:59:30] rosheee: Here
[2022-08-24T11:59:39] Mirono escooters: Entitled dude, im tired of his shit.
[2022-08-24T11:59:46] rosheee: They dont even know what the prob is.
[2022-08-24T11:59:50] Mirono escooters: Lets see what vote says üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è
[2022-08-24T11:59:55] Mirono escooters: Indeed
[2022-08-24T11:59:55] rosheee: He just said send new esc
[2022-08-24T12:00:05] Mirono escooters: Hes stubborn , doesnt listen, and just lies
[2022-08-24T12:00:10] Mirono escooters: And i cant stand that
[2022-08-24T12:00:15] rosheee: No hate xD
[2022-08-24T12:00:22] rosheee: Dis
[2022-08-24T12:00:23] Mirono escooters: st send me money or my gov will fuck u
[2022-08-24T12:02:49] S1m 0n: Have something similar with Flipsky right now. Of 2 devices one broken... no LED lights, no connection with USB or Bluetooth. But support is also playing dumb. Keeps wanting videos... first my USB cable was to blame. Then the USB ports from the laptop. Now the battarie should not provide enough power... meanwhile, they have understood what my problem is, but slowly my patience is also over and if necessary I get me the money via PayPal back
[2022-08-24T12:04:31] rosheee: my last words on this had 6 flipsky -> send videos everything -> no warranty no one of them worked -> no replacement even after sending back spintend -> since day 1 best support 1 was broken -> send it back -> paid shipping -> received new one they paid shipping
[2022-08-24T12:07:26] S1m 0n: Same with them
[2022-08-24T12:07:26] S1m 0n: <photos/photo_5825@24-08-2022_12-07-26.jpg>
[2022-08-24T12:07:36] sombre_enfant: 4 75100 classic 2 died on mosfet bc battery cut 2 survived 40 cm drowned in water
[2022-08-24T12:07:56] sombre_enfant: Buy on banggood for flipsky
[2022-08-24T12:09:20] sombre_enfant: I repaired one but i need to clean with alchool and solder braid
[2022-08-24T12:10:43] S1m 0n: I don't really need Flipsky because I found another alternative for me. But a colleague would have taken it and now I can mess around with the Chinese one
[2022-08-24T12:13:15] sombre_enfant: But i would never buy vesc with smd fet impossible to cool or repair
[2022-08-24T12:14:59] Mirono escooters: Possible to repair
[2022-08-24T12:15:03] Mirono escooters: Hotair :))
[2022-08-24T12:15:18] Mirono escooters: Cooling is true, maybe alu pcb
[2022-08-24T12:17:12] S1m 0n: I come from the Kaabo Mantis and there's no way to increase the voltage. Besides, I live in Germany, in a big city, so everything has to be legal. Fortunately, Vsett and Kaabo have the same protocol and the vsett 8 is based like the German version of the Kaabo Mantis on 48V single motor ‚Üí But can without modifications up to 17s and with modifications up to 35A. For me 16s/30A is enough, so I will install the vsett controller in the Mantis and can continue to use the official display.
[2022-08-24T12:18:33] S1m 0n: That was the only reason I ordered Flipsky, with the option of eventually going to DualMotor or one as a replacement.
[2022-08-24T12:19:26] sombre_enfant: Really hard
[2022-08-24T12:19:51] sombre_enfant: Depend on the package but most are
[2022-08-24T12:20:43] S1m 0n: With the right tools and soldering creame it's easy
[2022-08-24T12:23:32] Mirono escooters: I succeeded before
[2022-08-24T12:23:34] Mirono escooters: Its doable
[2022-08-24T12:25:58] rosheee: üòÜi write nvidia, amd, porsche all to send me new 3090ti, 5950x and new car because old one broke
[2022-08-24T12:45:51] Artem Bulashev: Man your issue is 99% caused by user connection error so stop it already and get it fixed for 50$ (mainly in shipping)
[2022-08-24T12:46:48] Artem Bulashev: You Damm duck
[2022-08-24T12:47:46] √óÔº°ÔºØÔº≤ÔºµÔº≥√ó: Oh no, Daly bms
[2022-08-24T12:48:32] Artem Bulashev: @Joondalup Do you know difference in REPAIR and Replacement ? VSETT doesn‚Äôt repair contorllers, Spintend do repair controllers! Why? Because VSETT sold you 2500‚Ç¨ scooter and it has 50$ contorller, while Spintend sold you 350$ controller that costs 250$! I vote not to ban you, but please wake up, the only scamming person here is LIKELY you, Spintend can‚Äôt be sure till they get your controller to inspect damage and what it was caused by (LIKELY because that problem appears due to user error in most cases, but you refuse to send to be inspected and repaired)
[2022-08-24T12:49:11] Mirono escooters: Hes too ignorant, don't try :/
[2022-08-24T12:53:58] Artem Bulashev: No you would not. Don‚Äôt kid your self. You would have to extensively prove it was not your fault of connecting it wrong - with what you showed here you have absolutely no idea how to build your case in electronics.
[2022-08-24T12:55:20] Artem Bulashev: Man they kept their cool well haha well done Spintend ü§£
[2022-08-24T12:55:37] Artem Bulashev: Fuck that shit I‚Äôm banning his ass
[2022-08-24T12:56:52] sombre_enfant: Miskine
[2022-08-24T12:57:12] Artem Bulashev: @Her0DasH @koxx3 @Happy_Giraffe @francois_schempers @Mr_Star_Delta_Motor If you disagree then unblock him, but he is toxic
[2022-08-24T12:57:41] Mirono escooters: Thanks artem, finally someone seeing it
[2022-08-24T12:58:45] Mirono escooters: Hes toxic, and ignorant. Worst people Dumb people cant do anything about it Ignorant can but won't. I hate liars. I fucking do

[2022-08-24T13:01:12] Artem Bulashev: About shippings guys, single 100v will finish shipping this week
[2022-08-24T13:03:45] Mirono escooters: Jajü•∞
[2022-08-24T13:35:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: Money perfume
[2022-08-24T13:44:47] sombre_enfant: Wich mosfet package? Tell them to put the size
[2022-08-24T13:45:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: üò≥ü§Ø
[2022-08-24T13:48:00] Mirono escooters: Well dont we know MOSFETs name already?
[2022-08-24T13:48:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: agree with blocking
[2022-08-24T13:51:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think always the JM model , the super cheap that they use actually
[2022-08-24T13:51:13] Mirono escooters: Ok
[2022-08-24T13:51:19] Mirono escooters: But is it good? Cheap?
[2022-08-24T13:52:03] Artem Bulashev: Dimensions of the controller ?
[2022-08-24T13:52:08] sombre_enfant: No
[2022-08-24T13:52:19] Artem Bulashev: We do I think
[2022-08-24T13:52:21] Artem Bulashev: I check
[2022-08-24T13:52:26] Artem Bulashev: Moment
[2022-08-24T13:52:29] sombre_enfant: Yeah lenght height wide
[2022-08-24T13:53:12] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5827@24-08-2022_13-53-12.jpg>
[2022-08-24T13:53:13] Artem Bulashev: Damm
[2022-08-24T13:54:15] sombre_enfant: Also again they did shit size not made for scooter and no mount...their pic are confusing its all copper then say its alu...
[2022-08-24T13:54:33] Mirono escooters: Thic copper plate
[2022-08-24T13:54:48] Mirono escooters: They made alu version too or smth
[2022-08-24T13:55:00] Artem Bulashev: Two options - aluminum is cheaper, coming abit later
[2022-08-24T13:55:16] sombre_enfant: Tell them to do alike litte foccer for around same size without any case would be the best for real
[2022-08-24T13:55:23] Jan: Why is the copper so thick?
[2022-08-24T13:55:28] Jan: 2mm is enough
[2022-08-24T13:55:41] Artem Bulashev: It‚Äôs budget target vesc mate 119$
[2022-08-24T13:55:45] sombre_enfant: Or 12 to220 mosfet but single and conpact
[2022-08-24T13:56:03] Artem Bulashev: But with higher performance
[2022-08-24T13:56:11] Artem Bulashev: So size was sacrificed
[2022-08-24T13:56:21] sombre_enfant: For around 150euro and they would be on top
[2022-08-24T13:56:40] sombre_enfant: Too thick not enough wide and long
[2022-08-24T13:56:40] Artem Bulashev: Working in that direction
[2022-08-24T13:57:10] sombre_enfant: Its skateboard size they made its a cube....
[2022-08-24T13:57:39] Artem Bulashev: It‚Äôs hard to compete with Flipsky that skips 40% of components that should be there üòÑ and also it is huge company which allows them to have make cheaper products easier
[2022-08-24T13:57:55] Jan: Looking for 20s or 24s controller (preferred up to 10kW) that have a thickness 10mm. Is there anything vesc based?
[2022-08-24T13:57:58] sombre_enfant: Little foccer seems bedt vesc out here in size/power they should follow that
[2022-08-24T13:58:09] Artem Bulashev: 10mm unlikely
[2022-08-24T13:58:33] Artem Bulashev: Beside it dies non stop it seems
[2022-08-24T13:58:38] Jan: If i bend the caps over on the focer i would be close
[2022-08-24T13:58:54] Artem Bulashev: Naked May be
[2022-08-24T13:58:58] Jan: But now its 30mm
[2022-08-24T13:58:58] sombre_enfant: Or make possible to have logic at a side and power on other pcb
[2022-08-24T13:59:25] sombre_enfant: Not stacked so around 20mm thick
[2022-08-24T13:59:47] sombre_enfant: And better cooling if naked and allow to screw
[2022-08-24T13:59:58] sombre_enfant: Its caps prkblem
[2022-08-24T14:00:10] Jan: <photos/photo_5828@24-08-2022_14-00-10.jpg>
[2022-08-24T14:00:32] sombre_enfant: Thx i needed that
[2022-08-24T14:00:46] Jan: Its an estimate !
[2022-08-24T14:01:03] Jan: <photos/photo_5580@10-08-2022_18-19-58.jpg>
[2022-08-24T14:01:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: Idk why they soldered cable like this lol
[2022-08-24T14:01:11] sombre_enfant: I have around 27mm on caliper with flipsky....
[2022-08-24T14:01:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Cable pressing capacitors
[2022-08-24T14:01:17] Jan: Its 18mm+mosfets
[2022-08-24T14:01:33] sombre_enfant: But need to add fich paper etc
[2022-08-24T14:01:35] Jan: Its ass anyway with 12awg
[2022-08-24T14:01:42] Artem Bulashev: Why do you need such low hight?
[2022-08-24T14:01:55] sombre_enfant: Small scooter
[2022-08-24T14:02:05] Artem Bulashev: For scooters I always through better have less surface and use hight abit more
[2022-08-24T14:02:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: Upgrade it with 4awg
[2022-08-24T14:02:22] Jan: Most compact and most efficient Battery BMS Controller Cooling solution requires super low height of BMS and controller
[2022-08-24T14:02:29] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 3shulmotors? But its new and unknown
[2022-08-24T14:02:34] Artem Bulashev: Or even make vesc with side fitment (smd fets down)
[2022-08-24T14:03:02] sombre_enfant: No more smd fet
[2022-08-24T14:03:15] sombre_enfant: Do a scooter version
[2022-08-24T14:03:19] Artem Bulashev: Smt is better yeah but takes up more surface
[2022-08-24T14:03:33] Artem Bulashev: Working on that together with Spintend
[2022-08-24T14:03:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: Smd is good
[2022-08-24T14:03:46] Artem Bulashev: But dimentions / proportions are at question
[2022-08-24T14:04:11] Artem Bulashev: What would be optimal (less surface, more hight?)
[2022-08-24T14:04:19] sombre_enfant: Through hole with tined copper like every bike scooter esc
[2022-08-24T14:04:43] Artem Bulashev: Example ?
[2022-08-24T14:05:00] Artem Bulashev: Those are SMD normally
[2022-08-24T14:05:37] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5830@24-08-2022_14-05-37.jpg>
[2022-08-24T14:06:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: Crap fets
[2022-08-24T14:07:35] Artem Bulashev: Yeah stock vsett9 23a only so it‚Äôs ok
[2022-08-24T14:07:48] Artem Bulashev: What is difference of SMT and smd?
[2022-08-24T14:07:51] Artem Bulashev: I don‚Äôt know
[2022-08-24T14:07:53] sombre_enfant: Pink pcb Blue 12 fet to 220 Other side Black caps Yellow phase wire And the logic stuff
[2022-08-24T14:08:30] sombre_enfant: Surface mount...
[2022-08-24T14:08:50] sombre_enfant: Thats the package needed
[2022-08-24T14:09:12] Artem Bulashev: Yes that‚Äôs what I think too
[2022-08-24T14:09:25] Artem Bulashev: But smt and smd what is different ?
[2022-08-24T14:09:32] Artem Bulashev: Both surface mounted
[2022-08-24T14:09:35] Artem Bulashev: No?
[2022-08-24T14:09:36] sombre_enfant: Ye
[2022-08-24T14:09:48] sombre_enfant: Other are through hole
[2022-08-24T14:10:05] sombre_enfant: Copy little foccer and we good
[2022-08-24T14:10:27] Artem Bulashev: They use smt?
[2022-08-24T14:10:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Same, smd means component, smt means the mounting process
[2022-08-24T14:11:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: Example: ‚ÄúThis esc is smt assembled‚Äù Or ‚ÄúThis mosfet is SMD‚Äù
[2022-08-24T14:11:43] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2022-08-24T14:11:47] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2022-08-24T14:12:24] Artem Bulashev: Wouldn‚Äôt focer be smaller if they used second PCB sandwich like ubox does?
[2022-08-24T14:12:34] Artem Bulashev: To separate logic
[2022-08-24T14:12:41] sombre_enfant: No through hole package
[2022-08-24T14:12:56] sombre_enfant: Nah bigger
[2022-08-24T14:13:25] Artem Bulashev: How come if there would be less components on one surface ?
[2022-08-24T14:13:44] sombre_enfant: Look at jan picture u will get it
[2022-08-24T14:15:30] Artem Bulashev: Dimention: 29*68*83mm, FETS: MDT10N023RH
[2022-08-24T14:15:35] Artem Bulashev: 100v single
[2022-08-24T14:16:26] sombre_enfant: 29mm seems ok may jan and roshee could try it on their g30
[2022-08-24T14:16:58] Artem Bulashev: Dual ubox would be 1.5cm less wide than two of those next to each other. But this one you can split so may be easier to fit
[2022-08-24T14:17:22] sombre_enfant: They need tho change case to make it screwable the side theres alu block
[2022-08-24T14:17:43] sombre_enfant: Add hole and thread
[2022-08-24T14:17:51] Artem Bulashev: Also 100v with ampacity of 75v at the price of flipsky, but with all the ubox extra functions, so guess slight size trade if acceptable
[2022-08-24T14:18:00] sombre_enfant: For now glue a nut can help..
[2022-08-24T14:18:38] sombre_enfant: Smaller then flipsky naked
[2022-08-24T14:18:51] Artem Bulashev: Really?
[2022-08-24T14:19:03] Artem Bulashev: Oh ok nice than
[2022-08-24T14:19:19] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Technology / Device...
[2022-08-24T14:19:21] sombre_enfant: Flipsky pcb dimension enght 76mm Wide 46mm Height 27mm Deport heatsink 10mm
[2022-08-24T14:19:57] Artem Bulashev: So flipsky is smaller
[2022-08-24T14:20:31] sombre_enfant: Yeah around same thing
[2022-08-24T14:20:46] Artem Bulashev: I would call that significantly smaller
[2022-08-24T14:21:05] Artem Bulashev: But will see how those perform soon enough I guess
[2022-08-24T14:21:35] sombre_enfant: Flipsky alu pcb is too long
[2022-08-24T14:21:43] sombre_enfant: They did better
[2022-08-24T14:22:22] Artem Bulashev: Ubox does have extra features that take space so I guess that‚Äôs why - you do get basically 6a DC Dc from dual set up
[2022-08-24T14:22:42] Artem Bulashev: And on off and other things
[2022-08-24T14:22:54] sombre_enfant: True
[2022-08-24T14:23:00] Mirono escooters: 6a nice
[2022-08-24T14:23:18] sombre_enfant: On off is kinda useless if bms has it...
[2022-08-24T14:23:31] Artem Bulashev: I think 100v single used cheap case - not cnc to lower cost - with custom case and adjusted pcb it likely could be same size
[2022-08-24T14:24:25] Artem Bulashev: Oh, well yeah May be, not sure, never used BMS with button. Always ubox with button. But May be fair point. Than again I do think 50% of users have such BMSs
[2022-08-24T14:24:50] sombre_enfant: I wait for next spintend naked and no smd fet
[2022-08-24T14:25:32] Artem Bulashev: This one was targeting Hoover boards and eskates and such and mono wheels
[2022-08-24T14:25:52] Artem Bulashev: I will ensure next one we all make together
[2022-08-24T14:26:11] sombre_enfant: No imu and useless stuff also

[2022-08-24T20:25:49] rosheee: what i have wolf king gt pro
[2022-08-24T20:25:56] rosheee: they start fuckeria at 60kmh

[2022-08-24T20:33:27] asyan4ik: And custom disk ;)))
[2022-08-24T20:33:30] Luis Magalhaes: so i fitted 2 75mm motors on the wolf ?
[2022-08-24T20:33:39] rosheee: lol XD
[2022-08-24T20:33:46] rosheee: you fitted?
[2022-08-24T20:33:47] Luis Magalhaes: the rear is easy to modify fit but how did the front one
[2022-08-24T20:34:04] Luis Magalhaes: im stock motors with bigger cables just
[2022-08-24T20:35:51] Luis Magalhaes: but larger magnets give you more torque right ?
[2022-08-24T20:35:57] rosheee: @PaoloWu
[2022-08-24T20:36:04] rosheee: we need more teh top speed
[2022-08-24T20:36:44] rosheee: or find chinese who does customeria 10" vsett like motor with le higher kV
[2022-08-24T20:39:17] rosheee: Adam what topspeed u had so far with vsett motors? faster than 73mph?
[2022-08-24T20:39:57] Luis Magalhaes: a modified interior winding for my motors should do it ü§£

[2022-08-24T20:59:30] Jan: I have written a guide (to my understanding as a mechanical structural engineer) about the most efficient layout for your scooter project from a electrical and thermal side. I thought it would be the best to just share it and have your opinions on this. It is for sure more efficient than anything Rion Scooters ever came up with. So have a look:

I understand nobody would expect anything from a scooter, so maybe 'authorities' ignore them? Are there insurance offers to cover them? I am looking for insurance for other vehicle prototypes too, help me find it at @createMovement ...

[2022-08-25T01:26:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: @roscheeee connect in parallel two batteries, don‚Äôt use one battery per motor until you see fire. In dual configuration ground always should be common
[2022-08-25T01:28:12] Luis Magalhaes: <animation>
[2022-08-25T11:37:29] Artem Bulashev: BMS on front
[2022-08-25T11:37:39] Artem Bulashev: Just like all scooters usually
[2022-08-25T11:38:40] Jan: Ok but then it still leaves you with a 500-800mm motorcable for the back motor
[2022-08-25T11:39:19] Jan: You could switch in all 180¬∞ but then you get the cable issue for the front motor
[2022-08-25T11:39:34] Jan: Also the radiator surface is a lot smaller this way
[2022-08-25T11:40:14] Jan: Its a worse layout üòï
[2022-08-25T14:00:15] Artem Bulashev: I see
[2022-08-25T14:05:32] Artem Bulashev: <voice_message>
[2022-08-25T14:37:04] Jan: I totally get your point. Indeed that layout i mentioned requires a battery with two outputs (i have this in the G30 project i do), so its a very specific highly optimized case, which would not get a lot of people to buy the product unless they have a custom battery with double cables. But it is the most efficient layout. What me & @roscheeee are currently doing for another project is a vertical esc in front of the battery. I would also suggest here to have 90¬∞ bent heat pipes transfering the heat to the whole bottom plate as it is way more efficient than copper. But this would require on length of the esc to be shorter than 70mm. Also an option if the esc is mounted on the back to have at least short battery cable + short phase cables for the back motor
[2022-08-25T15:42:04] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: üôèüôè
[2022-08-25T15:55:08] Artem Bulashev: Hey transfer away only needed when there is no cooling avaible in direct proximity
[2022-08-25T15:55:14] Artem Bulashev: We have the deck
[2022-08-25T15:56:19] Artem Bulashev: So best possible cooling would be if fets were directly on the deck without any extra layers
[2022-08-25T15:57:10] Artem Bulashev: The second best would be copper block to speed up heat take away from fet core
[2022-08-25T15:58:09] Jan: Thats the point i was making on the pictures
[2022-08-25T15:58:57] Jan: Copper 398W/m*K vs Heatpipes 100'000 W/m*K spreading heat instantly over the the whole deck for maximum exchange
[2022-08-25T15:59:12] Jan: Its just limited by TDP
[2022-08-25T16:00:22] Artem Bulashev: Yeah but that is per Meter
[2022-08-25T16:00:40] Artem Bulashev: But if you go across top to bottom ?
[2022-08-25T16:00:55] Artem Bulashev: Because we are not trying to take heat and move it
[2022-08-25T16:00:59] Jan: Its a volume
[2022-08-25T16:01:02] Artem Bulashev: We try to pass it through
[2022-08-25T16:01:09] Jan: Z axis is also super high
[2022-08-25T16:01:16] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2022-08-25T16:02:28] Artem Bulashev: For example 1x1x1cm copper block under fet Vs 1x1x1cm heat pipe
[2022-08-25T16:02:39] Artem Bulashev: Transfer heat from fet to deck
[2022-08-25T16:03:02] Artem Bulashev: I suspect simple copper would do equal or better job?
[2022-08-25T16:08:25] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: From fets to copper plate and then to heat pipes right to outside of the deck, then some needles there. that?
[2022-08-25T16:09:09] Jan: No i dont think copper would outperform a heatpipe here as well. The condensation in the pipe would work the same
[2022-08-25T16:10:13] Jan: This
[2022-08-25T16:10:24] Jan: Yes
[2022-08-25T16:17:13] Jan: The heatpipes are really optional as the tests on the G30 at 13kW continuous and 21kW peak concludes that it wont overheat. 50¬∞C max after several minute long pushes. Bringing that further down makes no sense to me
[2022-08-25T16:17:47] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Its already seems very good
[2022-08-25T16:20:37] Jan: The less thermal capacity your system has, the faster a heat exchanger can cool it down
[2022-08-25T16:20:57] Jan: Keep plates thin
[2022-08-25T16:22:01] Jan: Mount vesc on 2mm bracket and then press it on heatpipes and directly on bottom plate which is the radiator with fins outside
[2022-08-25T16:22:46] Jan: Lowest thermal mass with highest thermal conductivity with highest heat exchanger due to largest surface on the scooter

[2022-08-25T18:20:07] Artem Bulashev: Will ask them tomorrow 23:20 there now
[2022-08-25T18:20:21] Artem Bulashev: But for me aluminum pcb sound like a step in right direction.

[2022-08-25T19:00:41] Artem Bulashev: Dc-dc will be moved as well (controversial, but only way to compete, and it makes sense - read further) and will creat new ADC adapter - Call it like integration adapter It will talk to vesc over uart or can, and it will - Auto Configure with push commend for configuring vesc to what adapter requires automatically! - dc-dc 4amps or more built in - all adc adapter current functions - May be Bluetooth modular connection! So it is all in one integration that‚Äôs the idea that should allow to make great performance vesc at low price equal to flipsky but proper quality and with on / off circuits
[2022-08-25T19:01:49] Artem Bulashev: True but making custom order case for 4cm2 less is not possible
[2022-08-25T19:02:31] sombre_enfant: We asked for naked..
[2022-08-25T19:03:34] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2022-08-25T19:03:40] Artem Bulashev: I missed that part
[2022-08-25T19:03:44] Artem Bulashev: To sell naked
[2022-08-25T19:03:47] Artem Bulashev: Intersting
[2022-08-25T19:03:52] Artem Bulashev: Ok will discuss
[2022-08-25T19:04:19] sombre_enfant: .
[2022-08-25T19:05:01] sombre_enfant: Just let ppl screw the fet where they want...
[2022-08-25T19:05:03] Artem Bulashev: Naked aluminum means without anodizing
[2022-08-25T19:05:56] sombre_enfant: .
[2022-08-25T19:06:18] sombre_enfant: .
[2022-08-25T19:10:37] Artem Bulashev: Ok good
[2022-08-25T19:27:03] Ofek üê•: Sounds good! I like built in adc input, but it's not a must if the ADC adapter is compact üëå
[2022-08-25T20:17:08] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I feel like adc with all the fictions like horn and front and blinkers and brake light outputs and inputs is better suited (more logical) place for dc-dc to be vs in each vesc smaller amps I said to make 4amps continues minimum dc-dc since we are moving it out to ‚Äúintegration adapter‚Äù
[2022-08-25T20:18:22] Artem Bulashev: Intersting package choice is in trampa 75300 - dual cooling I guess https://www.infineon.com/cms/cn/product/power/mosfet/n-channel/irf7748l1/
[2022-08-25T20:18:56] Artem Bulashev: Not exact model, link is to 60v, they use 80v version
[2022-08-25T21:14:03] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-08-25T21:19:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Very bad package.
[2022-08-25T21:19:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: Flipsky 75200 use this too
[2022-08-25T21:43:50] Luis Magalhaes: Is vanishing üòÇ
[2022-08-25T21:44:00] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-08-25T22:01:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i had such package on first flipsky 75100. a nightmare to repair ü•≥
[2022-08-25T22:24:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: My was on 75200 and boom in the detection
[2022-08-25T22:24:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: Both
[2022-08-25T22:27:01] Artem Bulashev: Top cooling, why is it bad? Trampa 75300 is bad?
[2022-08-25T22:27:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: They don‚Äôt handle big current
[2022-08-25T22:27:42] sombre_enfant: Worst type
[2022-08-25T22:27:52] Artem Bulashev: Something tells me issue is not the package but flipsky again removing 50% of needed components
[2022-08-25T22:27:53] sombre_enfant: Ask through hole pls
[2022-08-25T22:27:55] Artem Bulashev: I see
[2022-08-25T22:28:31] Artem Bulashev: May be was fake btw on flipsky
[2022-08-25T22:28:50] Artem Bulashev: Any one used trampa 75300?
[2022-08-25T22:29:09] Artem Bulashev: Why would they use that one for 300a version if it can‚Äôt handle high current / have bad heat deception - trampa is sort of No-Price-compromise brand
[2022-08-25T22:31:52] Artem Bulashev: I‚Äôm just trying to learn about different packages advantages and disadvantage - outside of their possibly poor implementation. Flipsky could have used bad or fake driver which caused it to lock up and boom than - that is if trampa works well, if not than could be the package yeah
[2022-08-25T22:32:13] Artem Bulashev: https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/mosfetpackageeepn0204.pdf?fileId=5546d462533600a40153574455f93f58
[2022-08-25T22:32:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: I had them
[2022-08-25T22:33:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Same problem too
[2022-08-25T22:33:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: Very fast heat
[2022-08-25T22:33:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: Are so small package
[2022-08-25T22:33:21] sombre_enfant: They maybe used more than two per phase...
[2022-08-25T22:34:54] Artem Bulashev: I think I found
[2022-08-25T22:34:56] Artem Bulashev: Why
[2022-08-25T22:36:07] Artem Bulashev: Top surface on DirectFet is the drain, and that goes directly off there die. Thermal mass is not there to carry heat away as quickly as in other packages
[2022-08-25T22:36:45] Artem Bulashev: So peak amps can over heat die easier perhaps
[2022-08-25T22:37:01] Artem Bulashev: They are made to compete vs to-8
[2022-08-25T22:37:06] Artem Bulashev: And not to-220
[2022-08-25T22:37:56] sombre_enfant: The one package similar to soc-8 was actually very good for heat and repair...
[2022-08-25T22:38:01] Artem Bulashev: But I guess it may be possible to use 12 fet system on suraface of 6 fet of to-220 (basically more power dense, but smaller)
[2022-08-25T22:38:36] Artem Bulashev: Interesting any way to learn :)
[2022-08-25T22:39:27] sombre_enfant: Check b-esc his board are perfect
[2022-08-25T22:39:27] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5855@25-08-2022_22-39-27.jpg>
[2022-08-25T22:39:41] Artem Bulashev: That is crazy progress
[2022-08-25T22:40:33] Artem Bulashev: Link?
[2022-08-25T22:40:56] sombre_enfant: No link its @PaoloWu student
[2022-08-25T22:42:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_5856@25-08-2022_22-42-07.jpg>
[2022-08-25T22:42:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs good package for high power
[2022-08-25T22:43:35] sombre_enfant: La taille elle est coquine tho
[2022-08-25T22:43:35] sombre_enfant: Domani provo questa
[2022-08-25T22:43:54] sombre_enfant: But same princip as foccer
[2022-08-25T22:45:10] Jan: üëç
[2022-08-25T22:45:52] Jan: Soldering XT90 true pain
[2022-08-25T23:03:39] Artem Bulashev: BESC has maximum 200a and 125 battery but it is HUMAGUS
[2022-08-25T23:04:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: Our can 150A battery and 250 phase ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2022-08-25T23:04:54] Artem Bulashev: It is not that much more amps than 100v single new can handle. But it is 5 times the side and 10 times the volume üòÑ
[2022-08-25T23:05:45] Artem Bulashev: If it would be 12 fet it would do it easy as well but be 5 times smaller
[2022-08-25T23:06:19] Artem Bulashev: I was expecting more from BESC size, thats what I‚Äôm saying
[2022-08-25T23:07:36] Artem Bulashev: I guess they down rate that monster
[2022-08-25T23:10:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think you made some confusion. Handle mean run at 250A and temp goes down . Not like 100v single that set 130A and heat up to 80C in 3 second
[2022-08-25T23:12:41] Artem Bulashev: Oh ok
[2022-08-25T23:13:45] Artem Bulashev: Because on his page he says 200a rating phase max and 125a battery max on 150v200a (not 100v400a version)
[2022-08-25T23:14:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: When big power the circuit should be stable
[2022-08-25T23:15:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Here can reach 13.200uF capacitance and super low ESR
[2022-08-25T23:15:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: Other like spintend or TRONIC has like 600/700uF üòÇ
[2022-08-25T23:16:04] Artem Bulashev: Yeah hence the size
[2022-08-25T23:16:16] Artem Bulashev: Nearly 20cm by 9cm I think it is
[2022-08-25T23:16:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: All components are in, not removed components by vesc schematic
[2022-08-25T23:16:41] Artem Bulashev: Of course
[2022-08-25T23:16:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you reduce number of components , the worse control and security
[2022-08-25T23:16:56] Artem Bulashev: Say hi to flipsky
[2022-08-25T23:17:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: In the fact mtpa don‚Äôt work well on flipsky or never worked
[2022-08-25T23:17:42] Artem Bulashev: Spintend claim they do not remove components and update pcb as per updates of vesc official schemes
[2022-08-25T23:18:05] Artem Bulashev: Don‚Äôt know if they do some or really do not at all
[2022-08-25T23:18:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: Spintend has bad cooling
[2022-08-25T23:19:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: They are still working to cooling the resin üòÇ
[2022-08-25T23:21:37] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5859@25-08-2022_23-21-37.jpg>
[2022-08-25T23:21:47] Artem Bulashev: üòÅ
[2022-08-25T23:21:54] Artem Bulashev: Some crazy shit going on
[2022-08-25T23:22:10] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5861@25-08-2022_23-22-10.jpg>
[2022-08-25T23:22:42] Mirono escooters: That cap
[2022-08-25T23:39:51] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5862@25-08-2022_23-39-51.jpg>
[2022-08-25T23:39:51] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5863@25-08-2022_23-39-51.jpg>
[2022-08-25T23:39:51] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5864@25-08-2022_23-39-51.jpg>
[2022-08-25T23:40:27] Mirono escooters: Oof
[2022-08-25T23:40:53] Artem Bulashev: So yeah they used 18 fets to be ‚Äú300a‚Äù Would not belive that rating though because that means 2fets = 6fet contorller can have rating of 100a equal to a pair of to-220 haha
[2022-08-25T23:41:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: Trampa is one of vesc with major number of exploded
[2022-08-25T23:41:34] Artem Bulashev: No wonder with such design
[2022-08-25T23:42:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: These mos handle 30A continuously and 70A peak in their design
[2022-08-25T23:42:02] Artem Bulashev: Not even a reinforcement with copper on 300a rated controller lol
[2022-08-25T23:42:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: The thermal pad is thick 5mmüòÖüòÖüòÖ very very bad thermal transfer
[2022-08-25T23:42:48] Artem Bulashev: 6*50= 300a
[2022-08-25T23:42:54] Artem Bulashev: Seems like issue was not fets
[2022-08-25T23:43:00] Artem Bulashev: But design and implementation
[2022-08-25T23:43:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: Max thickness for fet is 1mm
[2022-08-25T23:43:32] Artem Bulashev: Yeah should not be designed to have more
[2022-08-25T23:43:35] Artem Bulashev: 0.5 better
[2022-08-25T23:43:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: What?
[2022-08-25T23:43:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Why 6*50?
[2022-08-25T23:44:14] Artem Bulashev: 6 fets * longer term max power (in between nominal 30a and max 70a)
[2022-08-25T23:45:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: They are 3 fets in parallel
[2022-08-25T23:45:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: So why *6?
[2022-08-25T23:45:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: I see here 18 mos, 18/6 = 3
[2022-08-25T23:46:03] Artem Bulashev: Emm
[2022-08-25T23:46:09] Artem Bulashev: 3 outputs
[2022-08-25T23:46:13] Artem Bulashev: 18 fets
[2022-08-25T23:46:25] Artem Bulashev: üòÖ = 6 per phase
[2022-08-25T23:46:34] Artem Bulashev: Or at I missing something
[2022-08-25T23:47:04] Artem Bulashev: One of us is having brain fart üòÑ
[2022-08-25T23:50:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: The current is divided with parallel fets
[2022-08-25T23:56:40] Artem Bulashev: Yes you mean there Are 2 in series ?
[2022-08-25T23:56:53] Artem Bulashev: So Ubox has 1 in parallel and 2 in series ?
[2022-08-25T23:57:16] Artem Bulashev: Why they use fets in series
[2022-08-25T23:57:52] Artem Bulashev: How da hell they expected those 3 in p to do 300a max even üòÖüòÖ thats crazy
[2022-08-25T23:58:46] Artem Bulashev: <animation>
[2022-08-26T00:20:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: Omg
[2022-08-26T00:20:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: Why trying to learn me that I already know
[2022-08-26T00:21:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, 300A is divided with 3 mos, 100A each mos
[2022-08-26T00:21:57] Mirono escooters: We are hear to learn -_-
[2022-08-26T00:22:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ask to your friend John, maybe he is able to . Sorry but I‚Äôve very bad English knowledge, so I can‚Äôt learn the group:/
[2022-08-26T00:30:45] sombre_enfant: If it was divided by 6 it would mean we could use 3 fet to pilot a motor....
[2022-08-26T00:30:56] sombre_enfant: Think about it
[2022-08-26T00:32:06] sombre_enfant: Now controller with 15 and 9 fet ....
[2022-08-26T00:32:31] Mirono escooters: Eh how
[2022-08-26T00:45:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: Just adding a mos in some phase
[2022-08-26T00:45:18] Mirono escooters: Bruh why
[2022-08-26T00:45:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: Reduce little quantity of heat
[2022-08-26T00:45:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: No too useful
[2022-08-26T00:45:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: Just help a little
[2022-08-26T00:47:04] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2022-08-26T00:47:12] Mirono escooters: China
[2022-08-26T00:48:27] D J: Where is it?üôÇ
[2022-08-26T01:03:30] Artem Bulashev: Im not teaching you, i ask you. I didn‚Äôt know controllers have 2 fets in series, why do we need fets in series ?
[2022-08-26T01:05:51] Artem Bulashev: Now I‚Äôm completely confused
[2022-08-26T01:06:48] Artem Bulashev: So Ubox for example uses 6 fets. 2s1p mosfets per phase Or just 2 in parallel? Why do we need 2 in series, what does it do?
[2022-08-26T01:09:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because controller work like this: The current pass as the first step in the source of first mosfet and regulate the current (negative), and drain output the current, then current pass in the resistance (motor phase) and return to the source of mosfet of second phase , the drain of the second phase mosfet is connected with positive
[2022-08-26T01:09:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: I‚Äôm really no able to explain, I never learned English , just in telegram chats xd
[2022-08-26T01:15:47] Artem Bulashev: Yes, this expansion says one fet in series per phase, than motor than other phase mosfet
[2022-08-26T01:18:03] Artem Bulashev: But you said it is only 3 parallel, so 2 in series per phase. That‚Äôs why I asked you why we need series. (I always thought that those mosfets are all in parallel)
[2022-08-26T01:18:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes so if you have 18 fet, you can calculate the current / 3 . is complex how three-phase motor works, but is the most efficient :) So yes, in single mos will pass 100A if you have 300A phase signed on vesc
[2022-08-26T01:19:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_5866@26-08-2022_01-19-30.jpg>
[2022-08-26T01:19:37] Artem Bulashev: I thought they are all in parallel
[2022-08-26T01:19:44] sombre_enfant: Motor work on 2 phase only in load after a speed it just switch wich is actived
[2022-08-26T01:19:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: Here, each box‚Äôs mosfet are in parallel
[2022-08-26T01:20:20] Artem Bulashev: True, so technically 300a per phase, but due to quick phase switching it averages to 200a per phase
[2022-08-26T01:20:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: Bldc is alternate
[2022-08-26T01:20:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: Very fast current switching
[2022-08-26T01:21:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: In the fact not all mosfet are ok for motor drive, they should be for fast switching use
[2022-08-26T01:21:30] Artem Bulashev: Yea
[2022-08-26T01:21:40] sombre_enfant: Then on 15 or 9 they do this but on 1/2 2/3
[2022-08-26T01:22:29] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-08-26T01:22:42] Artem Bulashev: Question is how does current flow through them
[2022-08-26T01:22:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: In the 9 mos controller they add just 1 mos more in the low phase
[2022-08-26T01:23:22] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5868@26-08-2022_01-23-22.jpg>
[2022-08-26T01:23:27] Artem Bulashev: Like so?
[2022-08-26T01:23:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_5869@26-08-2022_01-23-49.jpg>
[2022-08-26T01:23:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt know if you can understand this
[2022-08-26T01:24:00] Artem Bulashev: 3 parallel going through 2 series of fets?
[2022-08-26T01:24:07] Artem Bulashev: Moment
[2022-08-26T01:24:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: But is very clearly
[2022-08-26T01:24:32] Artem Bulashev: Yeah that is same as
[2022-08-26T01:24:35] Artem Bulashev: This
[2022-08-26T01:24:55] Artem Bulashev: Ohhhh
[2022-08-26T01:24:57] Artem Bulashev: Wait
[2022-08-26T01:24:57] sombre_enfant: Seems alike
[2022-08-26T01:25:15] sombre_enfant: Flipsky do 9 fet controller i think
[2022-08-26T01:25:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: Did u know how mosfet work?
[2022-08-26T01:25:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: What are source drain and gate?
[2022-08-26T01:25:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is important to learn how the controller work
[2022-08-26T01:26:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Did anyone bought the newest 75200?
[2022-08-26T01:26:29] sombre_enfant: Not seen
[2022-08-26T01:29:28] Artem Bulashev: Understood
[2022-08-26T01:30:07] Artem Bulashev: So phase wires come out of positive end of one fet and negative end of other fet
[2022-08-26T01:30:23] Artem Bulashev: So 2 fets per phase wire minimum needed
[2022-08-26T01:30:44] Artem Bulashev: But they are not in series
[2022-08-26T01:32:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: Source of N-Channel mosfet is always negative
[2022-08-26T01:32:31] Artem Bulashev: Well ok one side and than other fet on other side
[2022-08-26T01:33:19] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5870@26-08-2022_01-33-19.jpg>

[2022-08-26T01:36:37] Artem Bulashev: Or not
[2022-08-26T01:36:42] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5871@26-08-2022_01-36-42.jpg>
[2022-08-26T01:37:17] Artem Bulashev: Here is seems like gain 3 in parallel as well and gain to grain so 2 series connection

[2022-08-26T01:39:28] Artem Bulashev: That makes sense wiring topology wise
[2022-08-26T01:41:03] Artem Bulashev: Or not actually üòÅüòÅ
[2022-08-26T01:52:12] Artem Bulashev: So it seems inflows like this (two examples, first like light brown and than at another moment it might be like dark brown)
[2022-08-26T01:53:10] Artem Bulashev: So all six fets on one phase are never utilized at the same moment only yellow or blue box at once on one phase

[2022-08-26T14:51:38] Face de Pin Suc√©: Can it has 2 5V output for the 2 way ?
[2022-08-26T15:40:57] Face de Pin Suc√©: Also, why 22.9mm ?

[2022-08-26T15:55:06] sombre_enfant: Pm
[2022-08-26T17:03:03] Artem Bulashev: Hi
[2022-08-26T17:03:11] Artem Bulashev: Yes it has many outputs
[2022-08-26T17:03:23] Artem Bulashev: You should have a small qr paper with manual online
[2022-08-26T17:04:45] Artem Bulashev: - 3.3v bi directional for vesc - 5v throttle - 5v variable regen - On off NO signal unless you scroll back over -20%
[2022-08-26T17:05:24] Artem Bulashev: About size of clamp. It has 3mm space between surfaces so it should clamp on any handle bar from 22.0 up to 23.0mm
[2022-08-26T17:11:17] Artem Bulashev: <voice_message>
[2022-08-26T17:20:12] Face de Pin Suc√©: It doesn't work, my friend has 22.3mm handlebar and it doesn't work :/
[2022-08-26T17:23:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: so it can do 5v throttle and 5v variable regen at same time for non VESC ?
[2022-08-26T17:26:03] Artem Bulashev: Yeap
[2022-08-26T17:26:41] Artem Bulashev: Can you please show me video how it seats fully tightened ?
[2022-08-26T17:26:52] Artem Bulashev: Thanks for feed back
[2022-08-26T17:27:37] Artem Bulashev: That will be easy fix but unfortunate
[2022-08-26T17:30:19] Artem Bulashev: That will be used on controllers like ninebot, xiaomo, etow and other. Controllers like zero/ VSETT / minimotors do not support variable regen (only on / off type )
[2022-08-26T17:36:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes but Kelly does ;)
[2022-08-26T17:48:16] Artem Bulashev: Right! Kelly too! Forgot about those
[2022-08-26T17:55:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: great
[2022-08-26T19:12:24] Artem Bulashev: One guy cut old tube, and added it as spacer üòÑ Another guy said one layer of fish paper was enough to clamp it well
[2022-08-26T19:13:22] Artem Bulashev: I will change design for future batch and increase compressing distance by extra 1.5mm üëç
[2022-08-26T19:19:29] Artem Bulashev: Also grip tape strip
[2022-08-26T19:21:21] Artem Bulashev: Also 25-40mm heat shrink tube one layer üòÑ that‚Äôs creative one, protect handle bar from cretches as well
[2022-08-26T21:37:33] Luis Magalhaes: And it works, üòÇ a friend have tested and will buy another for the other scooter
[2022-08-26T21:39:23] Face de Pin Suc√©: okay great
[2022-08-26T21:43:21] Luis Magalhaes: Will have to buy one too
[2022-08-26T21:43:25] Luis Magalhaes: üòÇ
[2022-08-26T22:06:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what is 5v variable regen ?
[2022-08-26T22:08:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you should draw graphs with wheel position and output voltages to help users to understand. personally, i didn't understand all available modes üòÖüòÖ
[2022-08-26T22:32:52] Artem Bulashev: Like xiaomi variable ebrake adc
[2022-08-26T22:33:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ???
[2022-08-26T22:33:35] Artem Bulashev: Emm ok
[2022-08-26T22:33:44] Artem Bulashev: Hall sensored brake lever
[2022-08-26T22:34:02] Artem Bulashev: Understand ?
[2022-08-26T22:34:26] Artem Bulashev: ü´∂
[2022-08-26T22:36:52] asyan4ik: 18s , catl 53ah . Maybe next week I will try alu PCB 75100
[2022-08-26T22:38:14] asyan4ik: now 16s , waiting for the controller
[2022-08-26T22:39:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hummmm. ok, but not from spiny then ? may be i missed the documentation from spintend website üòÖ
[2022-08-26T22:41:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but found nothing really clear here : https://spintend.com/products/two-way-throttle-spiny-for-diy-escooter-diy-ebike
[2022-08-26T22:58:27] Artem Bulashev: Instead of second throttle on left that is used for brake or brake lever with hall you will be able to simply scroll back to start motor braking (variable regen brake)
[2022-08-26T22:59:56] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_5878@26-08-2022_22-59-56.jpg>
[2022-08-26T23:00:35] Luis Magalhaes: Switch supports cruise and others, what is other @artBula
[2022-08-26T23:00:37] Luis Magalhaes: ?
[2022-08-26T23:00:44] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5879@26-08-2022_23-00-44.jpg>
[2022-08-26T23:01:18] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5880@26-08-2022_23-01-18.jpg>
[2022-08-26T23:01:54] Artem Bulashev: There is a wire that allows you to use rear button for any other function you want it connected to. Like horn for example
[2022-08-26T23:01:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: sorry, but i really need to see voltages to fully understand
[2022-08-26T23:02:11] Artem Bulashev: 0-4.2v normal throttle
[2022-08-26T23:02:34] Artem Bulashev: 0-4.2 variable regen brake
[2022-08-26T23:02:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lol
[2022-08-26T23:02:51] Luis Magalhaes: And how do you make "cruise controll" from it?
[2022-08-26T23:02:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: still not clear for me ü§£ü§£ü•≥
[2022-08-26T23:03:19] Artem Bulashev: It is by default if you do not use that wire that allows external function
[2022-08-26T23:03:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: seriously, make small graphs, it will be much easier to understand. it takes 30 minutes to draw and everyrhing will clear
[2022-08-26T23:03:44] Artem Bulashev: Ok you know how on xiaomi there are 2 throttles?
[2022-08-26T23:03:53] Artem Bulashev: Will do
[2022-08-26T23:03:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes
[2022-08-26T23:03:58] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2022-08-26T23:04:13] Artem Bulashev: To you wire this throttle as this:
[2022-08-26T23:06:03] Konstantin: Nice!!! I can use brake while driving by 1 hand!!!
[2022-08-26T23:07:37] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5881@26-08-2022_23-07-37.jpg>
[2022-08-26T23:07:37] Artem Bulashev: Throttle to RED / Black / Green and than add left throttle signal wire that is used for motor brake to blue wire
[2022-08-26T23:07:41] Artem Bulashev: Done
[2022-08-26T23:07:50] Artem Bulashev: Sure simple wiring :-)
[2022-08-26T23:08:05] Artem Bulashev: Now you have throttle scrolling forward
[2022-08-26T23:08:12] Luis Magalhaes: Understand thanks üòÅ
[2022-08-26T23:08:13] Artem Bulashev: And motor braking scrolling back
[2022-08-26T23:08:32] Artem Bulashev: It‚Äôs got to be most feature intense throttle to date ü§£ü§£ü§£
[2022-08-26T23:09:06] Artem Bulashev: Don‚Äôt recommend that but yeah üòÇüòÇ
[2022-08-26T23:09:50] Luis Magalhaes: If he has strong arm üòÇ
[2022-08-26T23:09:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok. i think i understand. but what about min-max voltages and dead bands ?
[2022-08-26T23:11:02] Artem Bulashev: All fully adjustable digitally
[2022-08-26T23:11:25] Artem Bulashev: I will explain how it is adjusted, moment
[2022-08-26T23:11:39] Konstantin: People now not clearly understand how things work, it's fine
[2022-08-26T23:12:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok. good. but it really needs a pdf or webpage to explain all that. currently, spintend website is really poor
[2022-08-26T23:12:27] Artem Bulashev: There is
[2022-08-26T23:12:36] Artem Bulashev: It comes with QR code to manual
[2022-08-26T23:13:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not really 'fine'... why do you think people burn so much vesc ? poor documentation, false specs are major factors from my point of view.
[2022-08-26T23:14:22] Artem Bulashev: http://175.178.7.90/index.php?title=Spin-Y_manual
[2022-08-26T23:14:44] Artem Bulashev: See point 3 - calibration
[2022-08-26T23:14:56] Artem Bulashev: It is pretty simple way to do it
[2022-08-26T23:15:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_5883@26-08-2022_23-15-35.jpg>
[2022-08-26T23:15:53] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2022-08-26T23:16:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: there is a step-up converter to output mote than 3.3v if you power it with 3.3v?
[2022-08-26T23:17:36] Artem Bulashev: No
[2022-08-26T23:17:50] Artem Bulashev: 3.3v power up is only for vesc
[2022-08-26T23:18:24] Artem Bulashev: But even if you use 5v vesc throttle wire will be going 0-3.3v remapped signal üôÉü´∂ so no need for adc adapters
[2022-08-26T23:19:15] Artem Bulashev: All other controllers use 5v supply by default for their throttles so no need to have step up
[2022-08-26T23:19:22] Artem Bulashev: Stupid proof
[2022-08-26T23:19:30] Artem Bulashev: Well mostly
[2022-08-26T23:21:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: exact
[2022-08-26T23:22:44] Artem Bulashev: Well I really hope I didn‚Äôt miss anything at least, it hard to try satisfy every single scooter out there, but I tried to make it so that it can work perfectly for any controller what so ever
[2022-08-26T23:30:24] Luis Magalhaes: @artBula one more question about the cruise control, did not see how to use it on that manual, so if i use kelly with it i just push the rear button and it activates the cruise to the speed i ride like xiaomi? Have to maintain x seconds in one position for it to activate? And if i want to turn off the cruise option i just push the rear button again?
[2022-08-27T00:04:04] Artem Bulashev: it is independant
[2022-08-27T00:04:26] Artem Bulashev: it is fully integrated inside controller, you don‚Äôt need to do anything to have it working
[2022-08-27T00:05:06] Artem Bulashev: Tap the button at wheel possition you want and it will ‚Äúfreez‚Äù that position siganl untill you start to operate wheel again in any direction
[2022-08-27T00:06:10] Artem Bulashev: this means it will work by defult on ANY controller, even if controlelr didn‚Äôt have cruise or had only Timer Based (hate those) cruise control
[2022-08-27T00:08:41] Luis Magalhaes: Hum ok i understand, but is it easy to tap the rear button using the throttle same time?
[2022-08-27T00:15:26] sombre_enfant: Could u add a boost mode like on thunder 2
[2022-08-27T00:47:37] Artem Bulashev: Should be yes
[2022-08-27T00:48:00] Artem Bulashev: In my testing it was easy enough
[2022-08-27T00:48:26] Artem Bulashev: And I had space to integrate button, so I figured why not :)
[2022-08-27T00:49:08] Artem Bulashev: Cruise in a tap is long standing dream - hate timer based cruise controls on normal controllers
[2022-08-27T00:49:18] Artem Bulashev: Can you elaborate ?
[2022-08-27T00:53:10] Artem Bulashev: ‚ÄúWant even more? Double-click the throttle for a 1280W boost.‚Äù this means that if you scroll throttle forward twice quickly you will activate boost as well - if spin-y installed on Thunder 2. that function increases Amp limit of the controller - throttle is simply a mean to enter that mode.
[2022-08-27T00:53:52] Artem Bulashev: like sport mode on vsett - it sets controller into over drive - 35amps limit instead of 30amps limit for 2 minutes
[2022-08-27T00:56:53] Luis Magalhaes: I like that too üëå
[2022-08-27T17:58:26] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: The other thing - how are you not burning motors by these overpower times?
[2022-08-27T17:59:57] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: So I started searching how to go about liquid cooling the coils?
[2022-08-27T17:59:57] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Why does he not focus on cooling the windings? Why not run the liquid right through the windings. Not necessarily hollow copper tubes (inside cooling) but seal the windings area and flood the stator windings with a similar circulation scheme? https://youtu.be/R-obxFq0bKs
[2022-08-27T18:01:04] Mirono escooters: Yes depend on situation
[2022-08-27T18:01:24] Mirono escooters: Thats some crazy shit
[2022-08-27T18:17:23] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Yes it looks like he is cooling the stator core thoroughly, but the coil will have to radiate or conduct the heat to the stator laminate first. So I am thinking one could first fill the coil spaces with a flow pattern in vax, then either glue in space or cast the external housing of the flow pattern (remember the stator stays static->doesn't spin) then the administration can either be one way focused (liquid nitrogen) or circulation... Why are there no halbach based rotors?
[2022-08-27T18:20:51] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: I also saw something about phase change for enhanced energy absorption but anyways I be thinking about that including on @SolarElectromobility or you guys have further good recommendations for groups with vehicles inventors who might share good solutions?

[2022-08-28T15:34:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: <sticker>
[2022-08-28T15:34:43] Mirono escooters: I thinn it looks pretty slick
[2022-08-28T15:35:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: Please, tell me what scooter display you find beautiful and original, so we can enhance our display
[2022-08-28T15:35:18] S1m 0n: Not for german police
[2022-08-28T15:35:33] Mirono escooters: Germany police state almost. With all stories i hear.
[2022-08-28T15:35:47] S1m 0n: Yes, they are fun breaker
[2022-08-28T15:35:56] Mirono escooters: Police state
[2022-08-28T15:36:10] Mirono escooters: Controlling, (ab)using powers. Dangerous game.
[2022-08-28T15:36:23] S1m 0n: Something round like that
[2022-08-28T15:36:44] Mirono escooters: Eh that looks ugly tbh
[2022-08-28T15:36:57] Mirono escooters: Small and weird curves. Smartdisplay nice size
[2022-08-28T15:37:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: Round LCD like that, 5+ years old design
[2022-08-28T15:37:06] S1m 0n: Yep, but it's legal
[2022-08-28T15:37:10] Mirono escooters: Agree
[2022-08-28T15:37:25] Mirono escooters: Why tff they care about a display??
[2022-08-28T15:37:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's weird
[2022-08-28T15:38:04] Face de Pin Suc√©: SmartDisplay has a police mode settable
[2022-08-28T15:38:37] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's only a central screen, can even be with same fixations as you have with your rounded LCD
[2022-08-28T15:38:41] Mirono escooters: Not like police care about car internals as long as its road legal.
[2022-08-28T15:38:41] S1m 0n: Because a teschnicher intervention from the outside is to be suspected. I would lose my license and would no longer have insurance coverage. I do not live in the country, but directly on the outskirts of a big city.
[2022-08-28T15:39:02] Mirono escooters: Eh, Germany. No further explanation needed
[2022-08-28T15:39:07] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes true
[2022-08-28T15:39:14] S1m 0n: I know üòÇ
[2022-08-28T15:39:31] Mirono escooters: Never am i moving there
[2022-08-28T15:40:03] Face de Pin Suc√©: France is good x)
[2022-08-28T15:40:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: it's all about luck
[2022-08-28T15:40:16] Luis Magalhaes: Portugal better
[2022-08-28T15:40:22] Luis Magalhaes: Police dont care yet
[2022-08-28T15:40:25] Luis Magalhaes: üòÇ
[2022-08-28T15:40:26] Mirono escooters: Belgium too
[2022-08-28T15:40:46] S1m 0n: Portugal or Spain will be the paradise
[2022-08-28T15:40:50] Face de Pin Suc√©: Portugal too far x)
[2022-08-28T15:41:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: Spain not always, I've heard they were hard on escooters and now seems better
[2022-08-28T15:41:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: Who wants to come to F1 circuit in Barcelona with escooter end of october ?
[2022-08-28T15:42:33] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-08-28T15:45:59] Luis Magalhaes: Spain have rulles and police in city's going after scooters i think
[2022-08-28T15:46:21] Luis Magalhaes: Portugal even in lisbon or porto no police after you
[2022-08-28T15:46:47] Luis Magalhaes: Vacation üòÇ
[2022-08-28T15:49:10] Luis Magalhaes: F1 scooter going out now üòÇ
[2022-08-28T15:49:41] Face de Pin Suc√©: hahaha
[2022-08-28T15:59:24] Luis Magalhaes: #slowasfuck üòÇ
[2022-08-28T16:00:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: Now we're going for a ride x)
[2022-08-28T16:06:45] S1m 0n: Is deleted
[2022-08-28T16:06:56] Mirono escooters: :?
[2022-08-28T16:06:59] Mirono escooters: What
[2022-08-28T16:08:56] S1m 0n: <video_file>
[2022-08-28T16:10:33] Mirono escooters: @koxx3
[2022-08-28T16:10:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: @SibClimb
[2022-08-28T16:26:46] Face de Pin Suc√©: Weird
[2022-08-28T16:27:31] Luis Magalhaes: https://www.smartelec.eu.org/
[2022-08-28T16:27:35] Luis Magalhaes: This one?
[2022-08-28T16:32:36] S1m 0n: Yes looks like
[2022-08-28T16:50:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, since nobody understood that it was a old/dead project on this github, and app was not working with it, i received many messages. i moved it to private.
[2022-08-28T16:50:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and nobody ever contributed except friends...
[2022-08-28T16:57:05] sombre_enfant: Leech onlyüòÅ
[2022-08-28T16:57:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: exactly. pissed me off a bit...
[2022-08-28T17:22:30] S1m 0n: So how much does smartelec cost and when will it be available? Vsett is compatible with it? why not kaabo? the protocol is very similar.
[2022-08-28T17:23:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: Likely 400‚Ç¨
[2022-08-28T17:23:54] Mirono escooters: Id go Vesc not bother original esc
[2022-08-28T17:43:20] Luis Magalhaes: What kaabo? If it is minimotors it works now
[2022-08-28T17:43:35] S1m 0n: Minimotors and Kaabo is not the same
[2022-08-28T17:44:05] S1m 0n: Some Kaabo's use minimotors, but not all
[2022-08-28T17:44:06] Luis Magalhaes: Only one that does not use it is the new sinewave and the chineses version
[2022-08-28T17:44:20] S1m 0n: And the German version
[2022-08-28T17:44:24] S1m 0n: üòÇ
[2022-08-28T17:44:44] Luis Magalhaes: Or it is the chineses low cost or it is minimotors
[2022-08-28T17:45:14] S1m 0n: I think is the low cost version, only 48V and single motor
[2022-08-28T17:45:36] S1m 0n: But this version is very similar to vsett 8
[2022-08-28T17:45:58] S1m 0n: Not Vsett 8+.. vsett 8 with 48V and single motor too
[2022-08-28T17:46:10] Luis Magalhaes: Ok
[2022-08-28T17:51:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: written on the website üòÅ works for kaboo with minimo controllers. for the other kind, i don't have any for reverse engineering
[2022-08-28T17:53:48] Luis Magalhaes: If he sends you the controller you can work that out as you done it before üòú
[2022-08-28T17:54:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: sure !
[2022-08-28T17:55:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but for now, the main goal is to manage to get it to production... and not increase the price ü•π
[2022-08-28T17:55:52] Luis Magalhaes: üí™ go for it
[2022-08-28T17:57:57] S1m 0n: Like this?
[2022-08-28T17:58:17] S1m 0n: https://github.com/teixeluis/escooter-lcd-esc-decode
[2022-08-28T18:00:01] S1m 0n: I have been told with the software HTerm
[2022-08-28T18:01:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes. or simply logic analyzer
[2022-08-28T18:16:21] Face de Pin Suc√©: <photos/photo_5891@28-08-2022_18-16-21.jpg>
[2022-08-28T18:16:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: That was a good ride
[2022-08-28T19:41:23] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2022-08-28T19:41:57] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb track or street ?
[2022-08-28T21:28:49] Face de Pin Suc√©: Street
[2022-08-28T23:29:00] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2022-08-29T17:32:20] Artem Bulashev: Man I think you are the only one with spin-Y for now
[2022-08-29T17:32:37] Artem Bulashev: Need to ask you or any one else who got one
[2022-08-29T17:34:10] Artem Bulashev: I found that 22.9 ring has hard time clamping on 22.2mm handle bar because as up part bends it become angled to the other side and bites the screw - so you can‚Äôt tight it fully without excessive force
[2022-08-29T17:35:23] Artem Bulashev: I reduce ring size 22.6mm - that should help greatly and in edition I‚Äôm considering creating bending points to help alumium to bend without being so stiff
[2022-08-29T17:40:16] Artem Bulashev: Like that, do you/ think that should won‚Äôt, it is still 1.75mm left, so not weak by any mean but should help I think greatly
[2022-08-29T17:44:51] Artem Bulashev: Generally need your guys experience on typical handle bar diamter. I see some carbom 21.8 and some handlebar go up to 22.6 -
[2022-08-29T18:14:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: I don't have one, you spoke with Sonken that has one, I need to order but always forget üòÇ
[2022-08-29T18:22:21] Artem Bulashev: Oh ok my bad
[2022-08-29T18:22:59] Unknown: @Artem Adam got his mine says shipping from 3 states away, can't wait
[2022-08-29T18:30:54] Artem Bulashev: Looks like all first batch May require too much force to have it tight on 22m hand bar, so solution is to add layer of anything like fishpaper/used tube piece/heatshrink 25-40mm between handlebar and throttle. ‚úÖ done It would clamp properly if aluminum would flex easier than I Predicted, minor aspect, but optimizing it before batch 2
[2022-08-29T18:46:52] Luis Magalhaes: My friend used some rubber to tight it up too
[2022-08-29T19:03:06] Luis Magalhaes: @koxx3 when will you have more smartdisplays, a friend of mine want to know the price and when you will have to sell?
[2022-08-29T19:15:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: still looking for suppliers for 3D parts. electronic & software are ready. chinese attitude for quoting disappoint me... currently, I can't give time frame until this is solved. but IT WILL BE SOLVED ! for price... it will greatly depend of those parts price.
[2022-08-29T20:29:49] Luis Magalhaes: Can i send this message to him? üòÅ
[2022-08-29T20:31:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: of course !
[2022-08-29T20:31:57] Luis Magalhaes: Ok üëç tks
[2022-08-29T21:59:51] Thierry: Which material for 3D parts?
[2022-08-29T22:33:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: plastic & aluminium
[2022-08-29T22:39:14] Oliver Eliasson: I use some electrical tape for my phone-mount. Easy to do one or more layers and is black so you barely see it
[2022-08-29T23:13:45] Artem Bulashev: Yeah it‚Äôs easy to solve indeed. Only need like 0.15mm layer thickness to add to get good grip (because a circle come to 0.3mm result)
[2022-08-30T02:42:42] Unknown: Shim from soda can mabey, tape might get gooey and slip.
[2022-08-30T05:41:57] Thierry: At work we ordered several times to https://www.hubs.com They propose instant quotation from 3d file for 3d print and cnc machining. You can easily check if this fit your need.
[2022-08-30T08:06:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: thanks. i perfectly know this site. but if i remember correctly, prices are excessivily high. i'll make a quote to check
[2022-08-30T08:54:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_5893@30-08-2022_08-54-29.jpg>
[2022-08-30T08:54:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: looooool
[2022-08-30T08:55:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_5894@30-08-2022_08-55-38.jpg>
[2022-08-30T08:55:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: by 100, it's much more interesting
[2022-08-30T09:02:29] Mirono escooters: Then it gets cheap
[2022-08-30T09:03:32] Mirono escooters: Metal would make it soo good
[2022-08-30T09:08:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes. anodized in black ... just the display back in black plastic for bluetooth & wifi.
[2022-08-30T09:10:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: total cost for 3D parts ... (not exactly total. joint is missing)
[2022-08-30T09:10:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 8440‚Ç¨ üòÖ
[2022-08-30T09:10:56] Mirono escooters: Jezus
[2022-08-30T09:11:10] koxx / Francois Deslandes: üòÖüòÖ yes
[2022-08-30T09:11:27] Mirono escooters: Just start a farm yourself at this point
[2022-08-30T09:12:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: just showing this to make people understand why we announce 400-500‚Ç¨ price üòÖ
[2022-08-30T09:13:52] Mirono escooters: I understand ;)
[2022-08-30T09:25:14] Thierry: I know that there is some company based in China which could be cheaper but I prefer to not advise as I have no clue of quality and reliability
[2022-08-30T09:25:24] Thierry: You can also check https://vcetasia.com/index-e.html
[2022-08-30T09:26:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: their website burnt my eyes üòú
[2022-08-30T09:27:44] Thierry: üòÇ
[2022-08-30T14:44:06] Juice: Jlcpcb?
[2022-08-30T14:44:47] Juice: Haven't tried myself yet but they seemed cheap for non-metal prints
[2022-08-30T15:02:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs aluminium price, why don‚Äôt use 3d print?
[2022-08-30T16:03:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: tried ... some parts reveived broken üßåüßå
[2022-08-30T16:04:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: because it's shit for commercial product... tried all FDM, SLS, SLA, MJF ... all crappy, at least for a real product. for prototypes, no pbs...
[2022-08-30T16:33:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you really want made big quantity, need at least 1000 unit
[2022-08-30T16:33:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: Then die casted aluminium piece
[2022-08-30T16:45:49] Thierry: I have a question related to field weakening. The set value corresponds to motor amps so it is apply in addition of cirrent amps. And why when I set field weakening maximum battery Current is exceeded?
[2022-08-30T19:21:04] rosheee: Whut
[2022-08-30T19:21:23] rosheee: Sry was hospital
[2022-08-30T19:21:28] rosheee: Back now
[2022-08-30T20:43:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: they shipped my ubox üéâ now let's hope I get it this week. üôè
[2022-08-30T20:51:58] Artem Bulashev: Yes mine as well few days ago
[2022-08-30T20:59:32] Artem Bulashev: Also two 100v single copper and few spin-y and adc board and buttons module
[2022-08-30T21:00:45] Artem Bulashev: Made a lot of small optimizations on batch 2 throttle Also sent LLT website link to Spintend to see if they can work out same shipping - free slow - 5$ slow with vat incl Or similar
[2022-08-30T21:00:53] Artem Bulashev: That would be game changer
[2022-08-30T21:14:30] rosheee: Magura trial sl carbon not recommend
[2022-08-30T21:21:47] sombre_enfant: So they send with alu or copper ??
[2022-08-30T21:33:20] Mirono escooters: Vat pls
[2022-08-30T22:15:40] Artem Bulashev: Copper is default I think
[2022-08-30T22:36:07] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-08-30T22:36:50] Tommy: <animation>
[2022-08-30T22:37:27] Artem Bulashev: Da hell?
[2022-08-30T22:38:46] Jan: Lol
[2022-08-30T22:39:14] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-08-30T22:42:53] Artem Bulashev: Crazy how much I redesigned the wheel - lost 45% of weight = less inertia = faster and more precise centering üòõüòõ
[2022-08-30T22:42:53] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5897@30-08-2022_22-42-53.jpg>
[2022-08-30T22:42:53] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5898@30-08-2022_22-42-53.jpg>
[2022-08-30T22:43:44] Artem Bulashev: Batch 2 goes into production today, for now sold out
[2022-08-30T22:44:01] Luis Magalhaes: Upgrade and test it then i buy the best one üòÇüòÇüòÇüòú
[2022-08-30T22:45:02] Artem Bulashev: Added flex points for optimal conformal flexing around handle bar, and optimized diameter it self for 21.8-22.6mm handle bar diameter now üòé (because some CF bars are 21.8mm)
[2022-08-30T23:10:28] S1m 0n: Are there any other alternatives to the Smartdisplay by koxx3 and the Vesc Display?
[2022-08-30T23:13:28] S1m 0n: What are ur settings to get 47kmh with 36V Ninebot? Gen2 or Gen2 Engine? On street ?
[2022-08-30T23:14:20] S1m 0n: Someone told me something about a metr module. But I am not sure if I really need it
[2022-08-30T23:14:29] rosheee: it was 52kmh but with blade
[2022-08-30T23:14:41] rosheee: with g30 motor only done delta mod
[2022-08-30T23:14:44] rosheee: 13S 70kmh
[2022-08-30T23:14:58] rosheee: but in 1.5months i can test vesc + stock g30
[2022-08-30T23:15:00] rosheee: even stock battery
[2022-08-30T23:15:03] rosheee: and stock motor
[2022-08-30T23:15:08] S1m 0n: Here is written with 36V stock Ninebot battery
[2022-08-30T23:15:36] S1m 0n: Work the delta Mod together with vsec üôà
[2022-08-30T23:15:43] rosheee: never tested üòÜ
[2022-08-30T23:15:53] rosheee: i have to buy new vesc and shit that can explode to test
[2022-08-30T23:16:54] rosheee: <photos/photo_5901@30-08-2022_23-16-54.jpg>
[2022-08-30T23:17:09] rosheee: yeh i set parameters but not magic
[2022-08-30T23:17:18] rosheee: i set 50 battery i think
[2022-08-30T23:17:27] rosheee: 130A phase max 150A current max
[2022-08-30T23:17:31] rosheee: and some other shizzl
[2022-08-30T23:17:38] S1m 0n: I have read again and again that Flipsky does not tolerate the cut off of the battarie well. What exactly is meant by this ? If the battarie abschlatet because it is empty, or because you draw too much amperes ?
[2022-08-30T23:17:56] rosheee: who
[2022-08-30T23:18:12] S1m 0n: Zuna wrote it in a forum
[2022-08-30T23:18:20] Mirono escooters: Its weird sometimes it dies after battery cutoff
[2022-08-30T23:18:35] Mirono escooters: We dont know why but since they skip some components.. eh
[2022-08-30T23:18:43] Mirono escooters: Alu pcb no problems uet
[2022-08-30T23:19:30] S1m 0n: So that's mean, when I never drive the battery empty, I'm more or less safe?
[2022-08-30T23:19:53] Mirono escooters: Ye
[2022-08-30T23:24:15] sombre_enfant: Uhh u got blade motor now ?
[2022-08-30T23:24:28] rosheee: nope is from german friend
[2022-08-30T23:24:34] rosheee: he waiting for 16s
[2022-08-30T23:25:44] sombre_enfant: Thats mad fast for 10s theres field weakening ?
[2022-08-30T23:26:49] sombre_enfant: Bms cuttoff setting need to be as off of real batterie limit so it dont disconnect ground
[2022-08-30T23:37:02] rosheee: yes but not much
[2022-08-31T00:22:45] S1m 0n: But can be. Kaabo motor 60V/1000W with 13s and 31A reach 57kmh under good conditions. Normal are 50-53kmh. Without Vesc, stock controller only with shuntmod
[2022-08-31T00:24:53] S1m 0n: So if the battarie switches off at 39V, enter 40V at vesc?
[2022-08-31T00:25:07] S1m 0n: Is one volt enough?
[2022-08-31T00:25:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: Lol, 16s can‚Äôt reach 64kmh , how you can reach 57 with 13s
[2022-08-31T00:26:08] S1m 0n: Don't know? Low voltage drop?
[2022-08-31T00:26:33] S1m 0n: I'm not the only guy who get this with kaabo Mantis in Germany ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2022-08-31T00:26:45] sombre_enfant: Nope
[2022-08-31T00:27:08] sombre_enfant: Its really on bms setting
[2022-08-31T00:27:49] S1m 0n: I will come back to it later when the time comes
[2022-08-31T00:28:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: Fucked wheel / magnet settings
[2022-08-31T00:29:06] S1m 0n: Nope
[2022-08-31T00:29:38] S1m 0n: Display and gps is same ... When its a different the display shows lower than rally is
[2022-08-31T00:30:41] S1m 0n: I have unfortunately no dashcam, but you can take my word for it. 53 Kmh are normal, 57kmh when the asphalt is smooth and no wind blows
[2022-08-31T00:30:41] rosheee: @PaoloWu 10S
[2022-08-31T00:31:21] rosheee: German xD
[2022-08-31T00:32:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: Be sure not a mantis motor
[2022-08-31T00:32:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: Mantis has a high torque motor, then no much speed
[2022-08-31T00:32:57] S1m 0n: It's shows in idle 64kmh with 13s
[2022-08-31T00:33:14] S1m 0n: I don't have the 500W Gear Engine
[2022-08-31T00:33:23] S1m 0n: I have 60V/1000W
[2022-08-31T00:33:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: I know
[2022-08-31T00:33:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: I had mantis 60v dual motor
[2022-08-31T00:34:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: Max free wheel at 16s was 67kmh
[2022-08-31T00:34:32] S1m 0n: On free wheel? üòç
[2022-08-31T00:34:38] S1m 0n: üòÇ

[2022-08-31T00:35:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yah, road speed can‚Äôt > freewheel
[2022-08-31T00:35:40] Luis Magalhaes: Mantis have 2 motor one with lower kv in the first and some model after came with higher kv and can get more speed
[2022-08-31T00:36:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: 3 version lol
[2022-08-31T00:36:05] S1m 0n: Yes I know.. free wheel is 63-64kmh
[2022-08-31T00:36:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: One max 67, one max 74 , one max 117 (minimotors dash)
[2022-08-31T00:36:27] S1m 0n: 4 or more
[2022-08-31T00:36:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: Even was so slow
[2022-08-31T00:36:53] S1m 0n: 48V/500W 48V/800W 48/1000W
[2022-08-31T00:36:55] Luis Magalhaes: Yes but i think only the last one comes with the higher kv right?
[2022-08-31T00:36:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: 64 with 60v double motor lol
[2022-08-31T00:37:05] S1m 0n: And 60V/1000W looks same
[2022-08-31T00:37:11] Luis Magalhaes: Ok üëç
[2022-08-31T00:37:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: My 13s single motor can goes more

[2022-08-31T00:38:15] Luis Magalhaes: Stock mantis..
[2022-08-31T00:38:51] S1m 0n: Stock Mantis sucks.. less power (single motor/48V) 25A only
[2022-08-31T00:38:58] Luis Magalhaes: @PaoloWu wheres the ducati?
[2022-08-31T00:39:20] rosheee: @PaoloWu where g30?

[2022-08-31T00:39:49] Luis Magalhaes: He has a g30 now?
[2022-08-31T00:40:02] Luis Magalhaes: I should get one to ride in the city üòÇ

[2022-08-31T23:36:44] Mirono escooters: Ah
[2022-08-31T23:37:04] Mirono escooters: Are those heat shrink with solder?
[2022-08-31T23:37:13] Mirono escooters: 99% sure connection sucks. Solder it properl
[2022-08-31T23:37:25] FrizerSeb: Yes
[2022-08-31T23:37:50] FrizerSeb: Ok i do

[2022-08-31T23:39:48] rosheee: ^^'
[2022-08-31T23:39:51] rosheee: just asking
[2022-08-31T23:54:30] Artem Bulashev: Guys what is oem throttle output you have seen ? 3.9v ? 4.2v if so what scooter ?
[2022-08-31T23:54:46] rosheee: less
[2022-08-31T23:54:50] Artem Bulashev: Current default end point is 4.2v
[2022-08-31T23:54:58] rosheee: never had that on throttle
[2022-08-31T23:55:09] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2022-08-31T23:55:14] Artem Bulashev: Minimotors
[2022-08-31T23:55:27] Artem Bulashev: Any one tested what is the output on max press ?
[2022-08-31T23:55:34] Artem Bulashev: Xiomi?
[2022-08-31T23:55:42] S1m 0n: Between 2,5V-5V
[2022-08-31T23:55:47] Artem Bulashev: Ninebot
[2022-08-31T23:55:52] S1m 0n: Nope
[2022-08-31T23:55:53] Artem Bulashev: Never above 4.2
[2022-08-31T23:56:00] Artem Bulashev: It is not possible
[2022-08-31T23:56:01] rosheee: ninebot hmm..3.59
[2022-08-31T23:56:11] Artem Bulashev: Max ? Damm
[2022-08-31T23:56:15] sombre_enfant: Thats only for brake
[2022-08-31T23:56:26] sombre_enfant: Throttle go higher
[2022-08-31T23:56:27] Artem Bulashev: No no for throttle
[2022-08-31T23:56:51] Artem Bulashev: Hall sensor can not give signal higher than 4.2 from 5v supply
[2022-08-31T23:57:05] rosheee: or less
[2022-08-31T23:57:06] Artem Bulashev: I thought so at least
[2022-08-31T23:57:12] rosheee: i use 3.3v üòÜ
[2022-08-31T23:57:20] rosheee: 0.82V low and then idk
[2022-08-31T23:57:29] Artem Bulashev: With vesc it doesn‚Äôt matter as you can configure
[2022-08-31T23:57:59] Artem Bulashev: Any example where you saw higher than 4.2v?
[2022-08-31T23:58:43] Artem Bulashev: Don‚Äôt remember seeing May hall sensor with output above 4.2 on 5v supply
[2022-08-31T23:58:49] rosheee: never
[2022-08-31T23:59:07] rosheee: i tried use X300 throttle btw with tronic üòÜesc not even booted
[2022-08-31T23:59:41] Artem Bulashev: :))
[2022-08-31T23:59:52] Mirono escooters: Impossible 0.8v drop hall sensor
[2022-09-01T00:00:15] Artem Bulashev: Yeah low is easy to configure and I just have it at safe 0v by default so scooter don‚Äôt run away
[2022-09-01T00:00:48] rosheee: but flipsky was best
[2022-09-01T00:00:57] rosheee: idk maybe no throttle filter
[2022-09-01T00:01:14] rosheee: all 0.5sec it set throttle to 15% duty
[2022-09-01T00:01:20] rosheee: was epic to drive
[2022-09-01T00:03:28] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5910@01-09-2022_00-03-28.jpg>
[2022-09-01T00:03:43] Artem Bulashev: 49e is most common hall sensor in throttles
[2022-09-01T00:04:03] Artem Bulashev: Output high fixed (cut) at 4.2v max
[2022-09-01T00:04:43] Artem Bulashev: It‚Äôs not v drop, it is by design to prevent output fluctuations from supply voltage fluctuations as I understand (as it can not step up, only step down the voltage)
[2022-09-01T00:05:19] Mirono escooters: Ah
[2022-09-01T00:07:49] FrizerSeb: sensor perfectly welded and I still have the error
[2022-09-01T00:07:58] FrizerSeb: <photos/photo_5909@31-08-2022_23-36-37.jpg>
[2022-09-01T00:08:16] Mirono escooters: 3 phases also ok?
[2022-09-01T00:08:42] FrizerSeb: <photos/photo_5913@01-09-2022_00-08-42.jpg>
[2022-09-01T00:09:20] FrizerSeb: the motor operated normally
[2022-09-01T00:11:12] FrizerSeb: is the problem with the engine?

[2022-09-01T00:19:21] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: I understood that you need to power hall sensors on Vesc so their max. Output is 3.3V because of the MCU being s 3.3V type?
[2022-09-01T00:22:59] Artem Bulashev: Correct
[2022-09-01T00:23:11] Artem Bulashev: Beside smart throttle like Spin-Y
[2022-09-01T00:23:26] Artem Bulashev: That one will give you 0-3.3v output even if you power it 5v or 3.3v minim supply

[2022-09-03T21:04:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: hey, I have a small issue, when enabling field weakening and letting it go in the air, it will constantly accelerate for ever when letting go of the throttle. It just stays at the maximum speed, is that normal? Because I have disabled e-brake by setting max phase brake to 0A and well, that makes it impossible to stop üòÖ

[2022-09-03T21:07:10] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @roscheeee tell me, you should know, is it the same for you or is it maybe because it doesn't know throttle input (not using ADC, but set-current instead).
[2022-09-03T21:16:20] Ofek üê•: I am using ebrake at 0A but have ADC2 connected to the low brake switch with pull up resistor. (Also inverted ADC2) This way it disables the throttle without applying brake

[2022-09-03T22:53:11] sombre_enfant: 203 on scoot is kinda hard
[2022-09-03T22:53:16] Mirono escooters: Ebike
[2022-09-03T22:53:24] sombre_enfant: Maybe on dualtron city
[2022-09-03T22:54:12] sombre_enfant: Well more ez with big 29"
[2022-09-03T23:22:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: noise on adc wire due to high current phase wires too close ?
[2022-09-03T23:24:57] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No, I use m365 dashboard with my VESC. No ADC wires to the VESC, only data from dashboard.
[2022-09-03T23:28:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it can do the same with usart. i have some troubles with controllers transmitting in uart and/or adc. it depends how much phase current you use and how far are your phases wires. use a shielded wire to test... if you have one (shield linked to gnd on 1 side only)
[2022-09-03T23:29:40] sombre_enfant: Thats where the dash freeze come from ?
[2022-09-03T23:29:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: fyi, on uart transmitting at 0-5v, we see spike at 12v on the line...
[2022-09-03T23:32:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, but that's not the issue guaranteed. I repeat, when enabling field weakening and push throttle, it goes max speed, I let go of the throttle, it still holds this speed until I press brake (with e-brake enabled, without ur basically fucked). This is in air of course, on ground you don't have this. Just was wondering why it does that.
[2022-09-03T23:33:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hummm. ok. not using field weakening. can't tell about that
[2022-09-03T23:34:07] sombre_enfant: It does the same thing on xiaomi firmware on ground it does nothing aswell
[2022-09-04T00:06:49] Luis Magalhaes: I already told him a friend of mine has the same issue in air but on the ground it doesn't do it, dont know why üòÖ

[2022-09-04T11:44:18] S1m 0n: wheel diameter, just means the rim, right? So for a 10" tire with a 6.5" rim 185mm, right?
[2022-09-04T11:47:24] Jan: 10"
[2022-09-04T11:48:17] S1m 0n: What 10"?
[2022-09-04T11:51:18] S1m 0n: 10" is 255mm.. it shows me a speed of 120kmh
[2022-09-04T11:51:37] Jan: Magnets set to 30?
[2022-09-04T11:51:47] S1m 0n: Oh

[2022-09-04T11:52:07] Jan: üòÖ
[2022-09-04T11:52:32] Jan: Most accurate measurement is 9.8" wheel diameter and 30magnets
[2022-09-04T11:53:12] Jan: Ah wait this is not the vsett group, nevermind üò¨
[2022-09-04T11:53:38] Jan: But still check amount of magnet for your motor
[2022-09-04T11:53:48] Jan: 15 is oddly low
[2022-09-04T11:54:45] S1m 0n: Yes, I have 30 too. But I remembered the 15 from the Pro2
[2022-09-04T11:55:16] Konstantin: 15 pairs, not poles;)
[2022-09-04T11:55:42] Konstantin: Pro2, has 30 üß≤ too
[2022-09-04T12:16:05] Federico77: Personally I found a reliable speed measurement with 9.5" wheel diameter

[2022-09-05T15:25:20] S1m 0n: Your upcoming smart display is supposed to have on/off detection? How is that implemented? By software or hardware? @koxx3
[2022-09-05T15:25:20] S1m 0n: <video_file>
[2022-09-05T15:58:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Mostly analog throttle and brake's need adc modul
[2022-09-05T16:12:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what do you mean by on/off detection ?
[2022-09-05T16:21:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: either the display trigger the power on of the controller with internal latch (require to send vbat to display). it act as 'master'. or it is a slave and use power from the controller (12v to 100v needed). if the controller has a power off signal, it can control it (for automatic power off for example)
[2022-09-05T16:22:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: example with smart + spintend :
[2022-09-05T16:24:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i cabled the power on button 'directly' to the vesc (still goes throught smartdisplay pcb). the smart is powered in 12v from the vesc. when vesc is powered, it powers the smart. the smart use the internal relay to simulate the power button press to automatically power off the vesc after x minutes of inactivity.
[2022-09-05T16:25:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: this cabling is a bit complicated but allows maximum flexilibity.
[2022-09-05T16:25:12] Federico77: Thank you
[2022-09-05T16:25:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it can be more simple
[2022-09-05T16:40:46] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Finally...
[2022-09-05T16:41:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: well someone should wear gloves
[2022-09-05T16:44:28] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: whoever touched the heatsink will now stay forever on my heatsink, don't know if that is so good...

[2022-09-05T16:53:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: This is normal for copper

[2022-09-05T16:54:24] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes of course it is normal, but I mean when they use copper they should at least be careful not to touch it straight on the back and leave their fingerprints all over it.
[2022-09-05T17:00:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes you‚Äôre right
[2022-09-05T17:00:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: But even design is totally wrong and useless

[2022-09-05T19:08:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: It should stay on
[2022-09-05T19:12:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, but only for that long that I short SW and GND with the screwscrew. Maybe I can find sum cables and wrap them up. Let me rewire the plug and always short the cable.
[2022-09-05T19:13:22] Face de Pin Suc√©: It should stay on without holding the short
[2022-09-05T19:19:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: That's how it stays on.
[2022-09-05T19:20:23] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <photos/photo_5949@05-09-2022_19-20-23.jpg>
[2022-09-05T19:21:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: wtf ! the power button stay pushed on this version ??? no more power latch inside this ubox ? ü§¢ü§¢
[2022-09-05T19:21:57] Mirono escooters: Weird weird ubox..
[2022-09-05T19:23:36] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes. That's most likely why I have to always short SW and GND to keep it on.
[2022-09-05T19:23:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: look at the button behavior. it must stay pushed tonbe powered ü§¢
[2022-09-05T19:24:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: when I pull the plug it will turn off instantly
[2022-09-05T19:24:46] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but what ever I got it to turn on. Now I look into upgrading the firmware to 6.0
[2022-09-05T19:24:52] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: or should I try it first...
[2022-09-05T19:32:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: The Single Ubox 100v is based on 100v 250A. So I can just compile it for "trampa/100_250" and flash it without any changes?
[2022-09-05T19:34:50] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: well ... try and see if it works I guess.
[2022-09-05T19:36:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/blob/master/hwconf/Ubox/100v/hw_ubox_single_100.h oh wait
[2022-09-05T19:36:42] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: there is actually a hw conf for the ubox single 100v
[2022-09-05T19:44:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: great
[2022-09-05T19:45:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: I think it is a dead latch
[2022-09-05T19:45:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ???
[2022-09-05T19:49:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Oh that's new I think.
[2022-09-05T19:49:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Cool
[2022-09-05T19:54:00] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Everything else I do tomorrow. Too late to fuck up my scooter.
[2022-09-05T20:19:22] rosheee: No cuz switch
[2022-09-05T20:27:30] sombre_enfant: Phase filterüò¨
[2022-09-05T20:33:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Oh yeah, what about phase filter on ubox single 100v? Should I turn it off or can I leave it on, no idea what it does.
[2022-09-05T20:34:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It is supported unlike what Flipsky does.
[2022-09-05T20:37:06] Mirono escooters: Not too many vescs support it
[2022-09-05T21:06:58] Artem Bulashev: Oh man how da hell
[2022-09-05T21:07:15] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5952@05-09-2022_21-07-15.jpg>
[2022-09-05T21:07:33] Artem Bulashev: üòÑüòÑ I wonder if it is dead now
[2022-09-05T21:07:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: What?
[2022-09-05T21:07:52] Mirono escooters: Potat
[2022-09-05T21:07:57] Artem Bulashev: You black wire is on wrong side
[2022-09-05T21:08:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No, all good üòÇ
[2022-09-05T21:08:18] Artem Bulashev: Oh hahaha
[2022-09-05T21:09:01] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Don't know why it looks blackish there
[2022-09-05T21:09:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But it is all good.
[2022-09-05T21:09:10] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Nothing wired bad.
[2022-09-05T21:09:26] Artem Bulashev: Record video
[2022-09-05T21:09:29] Artem Bulashev: Of power up
[2022-09-05T21:09:38] Artem Bulashev: BMS discharge is on? Get error ?
[2022-09-05T21:09:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I already figured out the issue. It was the button, it is broken.
[2022-09-05T21:10:05] Mirono escooters: F
[2022-09-05T21:11:16] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: There was nothing else wrong. Just button issue.
[2022-09-05T21:11:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and now I made it always pressed to keep it on
[2022-09-05T21:11:52] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: even updated the firmware to 6.0
[2022-09-05T21:12:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It is black shrink tube.
[2022-09-05T21:13:09] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: You see?
[2022-09-05T21:14:34] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-09-05T21:15:14] Artem Bulashev: Sure ?
[2022-09-05T21:15:19] Artem Bulashev: I go check now
[2022-09-05T21:15:40] Artem Bulashev: It is cheap version of 100v - 119$
[2022-09-05T21:15:50] Artem Bulashev: So cost cuts need to come some where
[2022-09-05T21:16:02] Artem Bulashev: One thing I have to say
[2022-09-05T21:16:14] Artem Bulashev: It doesn‚Äôt look doesn‚Äôt feel like cheap version
[2022-09-05T21:19:01] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but it broke
[2022-09-05T21:19:07] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2022-09-05T21:19:12] Mirono escooters: Doesnt feel like, but is
[2022-09-05T21:28:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Wash it down broüòÖ
[2022-09-05T21:28:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Does not work lol
[2022-09-05T21:28:42] Mirono escooters: Scrub off
[2022-09-05T21:28:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What you wash with ?
[2022-09-05T21:29:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But would be easier just to sand with soft ü§î unsure how you call this
[2022-09-05T21:30:07] S1m 0n: why exactly should you turn off the phase filter?

[2022-09-05T21:30:24] Mirono escooters: Some vescs dont support it and go boom
[2022-09-05T21:30:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also only one way to wash Cooper
[2022-09-05T21:31:04] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yep, maybe I could try that.
[2022-09-05T21:31:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If you are able to remove and really want to wash
[2022-09-05T21:32:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You can use l√∂twasser or if you dont have use the base thing, hydrochloric acid
[2022-09-05T21:33:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: It will clean back to new
[2022-09-05T21:33:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But you need to wash that down also
[2022-09-05T21:33:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Both acid
[2022-09-05T21:34:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: With alkaline water so ph back to normal or whole starts again
[2022-09-05T21:39:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Looks strange
[2022-09-05T21:43:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: @Cassseius is your button stay pushed, what you recieved from vesc? Or comes back to neutral position after pushing it?
[2022-09-05T22:06:16] Cass: Stay
[2022-09-05T22:06:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But for you it works ,i hope?

[2022-09-05T22:26:19] Artem Bulashev: Copper even on positive across caps
[2022-09-05T22:26:36] Artem Bulashev: They put a lot of effort into this one
[2022-09-05T22:26:51] Artem Bulashev: No solder balls
[2022-09-05T22:51:00] Artem Bulashev: Hm, if caps were to look up, it would be 61x50x40mm 100v 150a phase 60a battery capable VESC for 119$ or cheaper without case, only would need to re design logic, from. Single side to Double side to fit all components. Would that size be better for escooters ? 83x70x30?
[2022-09-05T22:51:00] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_5965@05-09-2022_22-51-00.jpg>
[2022-09-05T23:00:44] Mirono escooters: But more surface area more cooling tho
[2022-09-05T23:02:16] Jan: Flatter the better thrust me
[2022-09-05T23:02:34] Artem Bulashev: Not always
[2022-09-05T23:03:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: No
[2022-09-05T23:03:23] Artem Bulashev: Put caps up and it reduces surface by 35% right away and will allow for more copper contact area actually in design
[2022-09-05T23:04:03] Artem Bulashev: I also think it‚Äôs best to have direct heat transfer to the air cooled deck instead of dissipating heat inside deck
[2022-09-05T23:04:27] Jan: Yes
[2022-09-05T23:04:34] Face de Pin Suc√©: No
[2022-09-05T23:04:42] Jan: Or please explain what you mean
[2022-09-05T23:04:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes this is completely logic
[2022-09-05T23:04:52] Artem Bulashev: Large block inside doesn‚Äôt help transferring heat to the air outside it simply eats the spikes and heats up air inside, if anything it actually creates addition heat transferring resistance on the path to the air
[2022-09-05T23:05:54] Jan: Yes absolutely you dont want too much thermal mass, you need to transfer the heat away as fast as possible. That you do with large surfaces and short distance from mosfet to air
[2022-09-05T23:07:41] Artem Bulashev: If you put fets down directly onto aluminum deck without anything else in between, May be ALN insulator only with 180 m/k and nothing else it will be best
[2022-09-05T23:08:19] Jan: W/m*K doesnt matter that much if you keep distances short
[2022-09-05T23:08:23] Artem Bulashev: Deck is the largest surface we have - that‚Äôs my understanding
[2022-09-05T23:08:29] Jan: Yes
[2022-09-05T23:08:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: Using deck is not suitable for high power vesc
[2022-09-05T23:08:39] Jan: Why
[2022-09-05T23:08:41] Artem Bulashev: Why not ?
[2022-09-05T23:08:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: You need heatsink
[2022-09-05T23:08:54] Artem Bulashev: Max power comes when air speed is 40+kmh
[2022-09-05T23:08:56] Jan: You keep the cables short to an absolute minimum like rhis
[2022-09-05T23:08:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: Fixed on the deck
[2022-09-05T23:09:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: Deck is just 3mm or less , and if you don‚Äôt add heatsink it hasn‚Äôt good cooling effect
[2022-09-05T23:09:48] Jan: This layout
[2022-09-05T23:09:48] Jan: <photos/photo_5845@24-08-2022_20-59-34.jpg>
[2022-09-05T23:10:03] Jan: Can also single Vesc in the back with one battery cable
[2022-09-05T23:10:08] Artem Bulashev: That another question. Would you prefer to have vesc cables alit shorter than they are now ?
[2022-09-05T23:10:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: Here‚Äôs radiator
[2022-09-05T23:10:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: Then is ok
[2022-09-05T23:10:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Deck only isn‚Äôt good
[2022-09-05T23:10:29] Jan: <photos/photo_5847@24-08-2022_20-59-53.jpg>
[2022-09-05T23:10:53] Jan: Thats the largest surface area with shortest cable possible
[2022-09-05T23:11:00] Artem Bulashev: You realize this is not commercially viable solution üòÑ? Let‚Äôs speak reasonably
[2022-09-05T23:11:09] Mirono escooters: Watercooling is what i wantüòÜ
[2022-09-05T23:11:18] Jan: You can single vesc in the back
[2022-09-05T23:11:27] Artem Bulashev: Heat pipes is basically passive watercollig
[2022-09-05T23:12:04] Jan: You dont need it if controller tdp is below 500W. You can heatpipe it (heatpipe = "thermal superconductor")
[2022-09-05T23:12:31] Mirono escooters: Fair
[2022-09-05T23:12:38] Mirono escooters: But for fun
[2022-09-05T23:12:55] Mirono escooters: I am experimenting with pumps and stuff for my watercooled escs on my rc boat. So next step maybe
[2022-09-05T23:12:59] Jan: The chance of a leak is there
[2022-09-05T23:13:59] Mirono escooters: I know
[2022-09-05T23:14:54] Mirono escooters: Radiator infront, air-cooling when riding ü•∞
[2022-09-05T23:18:43] Artem Bulashev: I think problem is that we need to make a family Like 1. Ubox-S for up to 1000w (35a battery 125a phase setting) 2. Ubox-M for up to 1500w (55a 175a setting) : same but optimized cooling with no $$ saved 3. Ubox-L for for 2000+w (90a battery 220a phase setting) : 12 fet version
[2022-09-05T23:19:03] Artem Bulashev: Looks like aluminum PCB is the way to go for Ubox-M (maybe we skip the lower case and have alum pcb go into copper bottom (similar to ubox 100v, but not as thick, or even have heat pipes)
[2022-09-05T23:21:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: Tell him to made 12 fet alu pcb
[2022-09-05T23:22:45] Artem Bulashev: Narrow market but if we make it Modular design - same logic, only different power board, it can be very easy and cheap to do
[2022-09-05T23:23:15] Artem Bulashev: What price target is for those? 220$ for single would be good? (Flipsky is 250$?)
[2022-09-05T23:27:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: 12 v output is good to have adc2 feeded
[2022-09-05T23:28:44] Oliver Eliasson: If you do copper block on mosfets. Could you make it with standard PC CPU cooler mounting? Could mosfets be close enough to be able to screw in a tower cooler?
[2022-09-05T23:29:22] Artem Bulashev: Question is about Fan port - it takes space
[2022-09-05T23:29:44] Artem Bulashev: 12v in that questions remains same as now 3a
[2022-09-05T23:31:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: On spintends you have 12 v for fan but only reason to have that is pluging in adc2
[2022-09-05T23:32:03] Oliver Eliasson: So for maxmimum cooling you could drill a hole either underside of deck or on top. Only for really hardcore ofcousre but if mounting for original copper block could be same as standard cpu without to much truble that Whould be really fun
[2022-09-05T23:34:35] Artem Bulashev: Ignition is NOT same as on/off switch

[2022-09-05T23:35:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: For outside use copper is not the best ,will start to oxide soon as gets in touch in air moisture, in a pc this is different
[2022-09-05T23:56:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: For the same reason ,i dont really like there idea,you must isolate copper from aluminium, This is clear thing for me since , i work with these metals basically But honestly this is basic chemistry, periodic table tells you. Basically if its clear aluminium and copper, they never should meet directly only if they are alloys or with isolation . Also imagine you bolt mosfet on best heat bridge surface than connect to less good and maybe there is a heatsink outside Usually i use thicker, better alu sheet than the body is made from, than after doing holes ,i polish them to mirror ,than isolation, bolts and paste under it, Than from outside u put a huge heatsink what's a taller type and less densely ribbed But this is meü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2022-09-06T00:05:13] Jan: Maybe consider nickel plating then?
[2022-09-06T00:05:46] Jan: Just an idea ü§∑
[2022-09-06T00:19:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Try to made it for 199$ , will be overkill
[2022-09-06T02:08:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: üòçüòçüòç
[2022-09-06T02:08:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Adam
[2022-09-06T15:30:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If you isolate it with silicone pads its all fine ,just make sure you dont let moisture in , another you could do is add some silica gel , that picks the minimal moisture if there is
[2022-09-06T15:33:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: This is another?
[2022-09-06T15:34:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Last time i saw 50 s sdi was blue and only 9,8 Aü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ Or maybe i mix something?
[2022-09-06T15:46:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: 50e is 9.8
[2022-09-06T15:46:57] Artem Bulashev: You mix something up
[2022-09-06T15:47:15] Artem Bulashev: 50s is abit less capable than 40T in terms of amps
[2022-09-06T15:47:22] Artem Bulashev: 20a continues without over heat
[2022-09-06T15:47:28] Artem Bulashev: Vs 25a on 40t
[2022-09-06T15:48:15] Artem Bulashev: Yeah 50e3 is 10a (12a) M50lt 12a (15a in real life)

[2022-09-06T15:52:06] sombre_enfant: 30t better than 40t?
[2022-09-06T15:52:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: Current yes

[2022-09-06T16:16:41] rosheee: My seitch now also fucked
[2022-09-06T16:16:50] rosheee: Switch
[2022-09-06T19:16:37] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Just like BMSs should have a fan and heater (pre winter charging) output too
[2022-09-06T19:17:07] ToBeAsIAm InfiniteOne: Is there an open BMS out there?
[2022-09-06T20:28:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: M365 dash script running on Ubox Single 100v 100A üëç
[2022-09-06T20:28:03] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <photos/photo_5973@06-09-2022_20-28-03.jpg>
[2022-09-06T20:28:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Now I just need to put it back into my scooter and go for a test ride. üôè
[2022-09-06T20:37:53] sombre_enfant: What parameter u put ? Pls record bms vesc tool and ride
[2022-09-06T20:42:05] Luis Magalhaes: Nice üòÅüëå
[2022-09-06T21:01:02] Artem Bulashev: Also be careful as @koxx3 said that this project is in Beta stage so May have unexpected consequences
[2022-09-06T21:01:42] Artem Bulashev: I don‚Äôt know any one who actually uses fan :) that‚Äôs why was asking
[2022-09-06T21:02:01] Artem Bulashev: Beside 1-2 crazy projects using 100a to 200a
[2022-09-06T21:06:19] Jan: I would not use a fan ever, even for crazy projects
[2022-09-06T21:22:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: 125v 30A charger üòÅ
[2022-09-06T21:44:31] Luis Magalhaes: Fast charge on üòÅ
[2022-09-06T22:16:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: You mean the dash script? üòÖ I am the one who is maintaining/updating it so don't worry, it is in a stable state.
[2022-09-06T22:19:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: For the first ride I tried 15s 60A batt, 130A phase (had to turn down to 100A cuz somehow motor vibrating???). Temps are not that good, but I'll look into it when I have the time. The dash was working fine so far and always starts on start-up no problem. But why it vibrates at 130A phase...?
[2022-09-06T22:21:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @lBabacar and for 22s I still have to make the battery but I don't really have time atm.
[2022-09-06T22:25:25] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: when set to >130A motor current. goes b rrrrrrrrrrrrr (not the good brrrr)
[2022-09-06T22:27:09] Luis Magalhaes: @kawaiinekololis is there a page to see how to do that mod for the display with vesc?
[2022-09-06T22:28:38] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I made a German forum post, but well it is German. Might try using a Translator... and it's for Flipsky 75100 but is like 1to1 similar setup on Ubox. https://rollerplausch.com/threads/vesc-controller-einbau-1s-pro2-g30.6032/
[2022-09-06T22:29:58] Luis Magalhaes: Thanks i will try using the translator üòâ its a friend who is using flipsky 75100 in a xiaomi, so great üòÅ
[2022-09-06T22:43:01] Luis Magalhaes: @kawaiinekololis So you just have to make the connection cables using the resistors and capacitors to conect to a COMM port and put the script on vesc?
[2022-09-06T22:44:47] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes
[2022-09-06T22:46:16] Luis Magalhaes: Nice thanks mate
[2022-09-06T23:03:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: The clip was with Phase filtering disabled. With phase filtering I think it get's less worse, but it's really bad sometimes.
[2022-09-06T23:07:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: You need repeat hall detection , and set hall up to 10.000ERPM
[2022-09-06T23:07:36] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: kk will try tomorrow
[2022-09-06T23:07:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt remind what‚Äôs the parameter name
[2022-09-06T23:07:55] Mirono escooters: Yea needed this too
[2022-09-06T23:08:03] Mirono escooters: Sensorless erpm
[2022-09-06T23:08:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: Oh yes
[2022-09-06T23:08:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: This is due to motor saturation
[2022-09-06T23:08:45] Mirono escooters: Me at 200a.. 600erpm or smth
[2022-09-06T23:09:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: Too much current for the motor steel stator, the vesc don‚Äôt can know motor position, then goes crazy . The only way to resolve is hall sensor
[2022-09-06T23:10:24] Mirono escooters: Sad
[2022-09-06T23:36:02] rosheee: ubox king
[2022-09-06T23:36:46] rosheee: thought i fucked it up today morning üòÜbut some solder from qs8 desoldered itself and made its way to the 3 pin servo ^^' and soldered all 3 pins together lol
[2022-09-06T23:37:05] Mirono escooters: How
[2022-09-06T23:37:11] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: what the hell
[2022-09-06T23:37:29] Mirono escooters: How much power u run
[2022-09-06T23:37:30] rosheee: then tnght i took the 3 pin shit off and the solder crap
[2022-09-06T23:37:37] rosheee: worked again üòÜ
[2022-09-06T23:37:41] rosheee: not much
[2022-09-06T23:37:47] Mirono escooters: How u melted that solder
[2022-09-06T23:37:49] rosheee: 80A rear battery 65A front battery
[2022-09-06T23:37:50] Mirono escooters: Thats like 200*
[2022-09-06T23:37:56] rosheee: yah 200A max battery
[2022-09-06T23:38:13] rosheee: 220A current max front + rear 180A rear motor + 55A FW 160A front motor + 55A FW
[2022-09-06T23:54:51] Artem Bulashev: Change the Pwm frequency
[2022-09-06T23:55:10] Mirono escooters: Rlly?
[2022-09-06T23:55:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt think so
[2022-09-06T23:56:37] rosheee: 20khz easy + less temp. but vibrations not cuz dat
[2022-09-06T23:56:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: I use 15khz
[2022-09-06T23:57:03] rosheee: try out tomorrow after work
[2022-09-06T23:57:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: Suce sound, like tram
[2022-09-06T23:57:08] Artem Bulashev: PWM frequency change helps Also detecting with 50a setting helped me
[2022-09-06T23:57:37] Mirko Boni: Good evening everyone! Processing on the G30 continues as slow as a snail üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2022-09-06T23:57:41] rosheee: my motors sounded smoother with more
[2022-09-06T23:57:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: Just change sensorless erpm and will help you
[2022-09-06T23:57:51] Artem Bulashev: Expected
[2022-09-06T23:57:53] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_5974@06-09-2022_23-57-53.jpg>
[2022-09-06T23:57:53] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_5975@06-09-2022_23-57-53.jpg>
[2022-09-06T23:58:01] Artem Bulashev: Higher PWM is more efficient for motor
[2022-09-06T23:58:02] Artem Bulashev: But
[2022-09-06T23:58:07] Artem Bulashev: Heats up fets more
[2022-09-06T23:58:26] Artem Bulashev: So you can balance heating up of motor vs fets with pwm
[2022-09-06T23:58:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Motor vibration is caused by stator saturation
[2022-09-06T23:58:50] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_5976@06-09-2022_23-58-50.jpg>
[2022-09-06T23:58:53] rosheee: true dat
[2022-09-06T23:58:54] Artem Bulashev: Super low PWM is basically Square wave control
[2022-09-06T23:59:23] Artem Bulashev: Yes (can‚Äôt detect position due to saturation) but some how it helps
[2022-09-06T23:59:32] rosheee: nice üòÜbut to aggressive for rear :D take wire inside
[2022-09-07T00:00:04] Artem Bulashev: May be it was 50a setting during motor configuration and not pwm, don‚Äôt remember now
[2022-09-07T00:00:13] Mirko Boni: Ha ha ha ha ha! It is not finished yet! Tomorrow I'll fix the brake calipers with the hydraulic cable!
[2022-09-07T00:00:57] Artem Bulashev: Also I had brrrr on 5.2 at 85a phase
[2022-09-07T00:00:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: No true
[2022-09-07T00:01:09] Artem Bulashev: But with 5.3 no more even with 120a
[2022-09-07T00:01:17] Artem Bulashev: Don‚Äôt know why
[2022-09-07T00:01:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: Square wave also works normally at 15khz
[2022-09-07T00:01:35] Artem Bulashev: Sure yea
[2022-09-07T00:01:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: And square wave even heat 40% more fetsüòÇ
[2022-09-07T00:01:47] Artem Bulashev: I mean in terms of effect on ride
[2022-09-07T00:01:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: U talked about lower fet temp
[2022-09-07T00:02:00] Artem Bulashev: Low pwm has more punch low torque
[2022-09-07T00:02:12] Artem Bulashev: High pwm has less torque at low
[2022-09-07T00:02:18] Artem Bulashev: But more efficient same on quadcopters and same on escooter
[2022-09-07T00:02:28] Mirko Boni: Today I got the ergal plate! I have to cut it and work like a computer heatsink!
[2022-09-07T00:02:33] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_5977@07-09-2022_00-02-33.jpg>
[2022-09-07T00:02:56] rosheee: nice ^__
[2022-09-07T00:04:27] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I realize I should have said more exactly what I mean by like square :-) it effect on riding I meant not how it works
[2022-09-07T00:05:16] Artem Bulashev: Breaking news vesc is not true Sinewave though
[2022-09-07T00:05:29] Mirono escooters: üò±
[2022-09-07T00:06:03] Mirono escooters: Brr at low speeds or high
[2022-09-07T00:06:56] Artem Bulashev: Around 8kmh

[2022-09-07T00:09:22] rosheee: use PMT 10X3 tires :D
[2022-09-07T00:09:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: We had bad experience with pmt :(
[2022-09-07T00:10:07] rosheee: yep ^^
[2022-09-07T00:10:09] rosheee: once :D
[2022-09-07T00:10:57] Mirko Boni: Help Paul! I don't want to remember!
[2022-09-07T00:11:00] Mirko Boni: <animation>
[2022-09-07T00:11:47] rosheee: u bend the monorim that it is straight?
[2022-09-07T00:11:48] Mirko Boni: However Roger, there was no need to apply the banjo kit! Everything worked fine!
[2022-09-07T00:12:01] rosheee: i know on rear
[2022-09-07T00:12:06] rosheee: no problem
[2022-09-07T00:12:15] rosheee: but when u use 10x3 tires then ^^'
[2022-09-07T00:12:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: I need remade too axle of monorim
[2022-09-07T00:12:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: Too shit ur axle @roscheeee
[2022-09-07T00:12:34] rosheee: what?
[2022-09-07T00:12:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: Monorim axle
[2022-09-07T00:12:59] Mirko Boni: Because? Is the monorim installed badly in your opinion?
[2022-09-07T00:13:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is butter made
[2022-09-07T00:13:27] Mirko Boni: Paolo what happened to you?
[2022-09-07T00:13:31] rosheee: send pic from front pls
[2022-09-07T00:13:48] rosheee: where u see brake disc and tire
[2022-09-07T00:13:59] Mirko Boni: How do you want the photo? I have not understood
[2022-09-07T00:14:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: Frontalmente
[2022-09-07T00:14:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: Da davanti

[2022-09-07T00:15:04] Mirko Boni: I've done it before! I sent it to you
[2022-09-07T00:15:08] rosheee: Here with 10x2.5
[2022-09-07T00:15:14] rosheee: Where?
[2022-09-07T00:15:41] rosheee: Need exatly like my pic

[2022-09-07T00:16:59] rosheee: u don't use washer inside?
[2022-09-07T00:17:14] rosheee: and u see
[2022-09-07T00:17:46] Mirko Boni: Oops! I don't understand what you want to tell me! The translator tells me the washing machine üò±üò±üò±
[2022-09-07T00:17:53] rosheee: <photos/photo_5985@07-09-2022_00-17-53.jpg>
[2022-09-07T00:17:58] rosheee: Not straight
[2022-09-07T00:17:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: Che manca una rondella dentro
[2022-09-07T00:18:22] rosheee: Recommend also washer inside
[2022-09-07T00:18:34] Mirko Boni: But it comes in just perfect! Why do i have to put a washer?
[2022-09-07T00:18:50] rosheee: Security
[2022-09-07T00:19:01] rosheee: But up 2 you
[2022-09-07T00:19:04] rosheee: Just saying
[2022-09-07T00:19:12] Mirko Boni: Parli di rondella con il fermo di sicurezza?
[2022-09-07T00:19:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ha pi√π presa , la rondella segue la forma quadra del perno
[2022-09-07T00:19:32] Mirko Boni: Are you talking about washer with safety catch?
[2022-09-07T00:19:48] rosheee: no
[2022-09-07T00:19:56] rosheee: i used 2 washers outside ^^'
[2022-09-07T00:20:00] rosheee: safety + normal
[2022-09-07T00:20:08] rosheee: also washer inside cuz cable
[2022-09-07T00:20:14] Mirko Boni: A simple square section washer?
[2022-09-07T00:20:45] rosheee: otherside the one with outcut for cable
[2022-09-07T00:20:48] rosheee: <photos/photo_5986@07-09-2022_00-20-48.jpg>
[2022-09-07T00:20:56] rosheee: and 1 safety spacer each side outside
[2022-09-07T00:22:34] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_5987@07-09-2022_00-22-34.jpg>
[2022-09-07T00:22:46] Mirko Boni: Are these okay?
[2022-09-07T00:29:20] rosheee: yes but just front where motor is
[2022-09-07T00:29:25] rosheee: rear no washer
[2022-09-07T00:29:50] rosheee: and better (my opinion) use front 1 inside + 1 outside each side and rear only 1 outside each side
[2022-09-07T00:30:00] rosheee: not washer on washer ^^
[2022-09-07T00:30:35] Mirko Boni: OK perfect! Now I understand!
[2022-09-07T00:31:04] Mirko Boni: @roscheeee purtroppo ho problemi con l'ammortizzatore ROCKSHOX monarc RL!
[2022-09-07T00:31:34] Mirko Boni: The pin has a larger diameter than the exa 291r!
[2022-09-07T00:31:59] rosheee: Yes
[2022-09-07T00:32:02] rosheee: U have to buy
[2022-09-07T00:32:12] Mirko Boni: I had to order a pin!
[2022-09-07T00:32:31] rosheee: 23.0x8mm

[2022-09-07T00:33:51] rosheee: problem is
[2022-09-07T00:34:21] rosheee: maybe to wide
[2022-09-07T00:34:24] rosheee: <photos/photo_5988@07-09-2022_00-34-24.jpg>
[2022-09-07T00:34:36] Mirko Boni: Il problema √® che non si trova il 23,8x8 ho dovuto acquistare il 25x8
[2022-09-07T00:34:47] Mirko Boni: The problem is that you can't find the 23.8x8 I had to buy the 25x8
[2022-09-07T00:35:14] Mirko Boni: üò±
[2022-09-07T00:35:15] rosheee: <photos/photo_5989@07-09-2022_00-35-15.jpg>
[2022-09-07T00:35:33] Mirko Boni: In Italy it is not found!
[2022-09-07T00:35:42] rosheee: original rockshox
[2022-09-07T00:35:51] rosheee: i gonna test this one
[2022-09-07T00:36:10] Mirko Boni: Yes, yes! I looked for! But I can't find it in any store!
[2022-09-07T00:36:20] Mirko Boni: Woow! Fantastic
[2022-09-07T00:36:30] rosheee: you just have to grind a bit off
[2022-09-07T00:36:32] rosheee: then it fits
[2022-09-07T00:36:58] Mirko Boni: Ho un amico che lavora il ferro ed ha l'attrezzatura!
[2022-09-07T00:37:16] Mirko Boni: I have a friend who works the iron and has the equipment!
[2022-09-07T00:38:48] rosheee: ah then no problem
[2022-09-07T00:38:58] rosheee: do it urself
[2022-09-07T00:39:02] Mirko Boni: <video_file>
[2022-09-07T00:39:08] rosheee: yup ^^
[2022-09-07T00:39:16] rosheee: had same problem :D
[2022-09-07T00:39:18] Mirko Boni: Yeahhh
[2022-09-07T00:39:24] rosheee: received üòÜmounted and then OMG
[2022-09-07T00:39:32] Mirko Boni: I was really sad! üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2022-09-07T00:39:34] rosheee: then my friend made 2 until arrived
[2022-09-07T00:39:35] rosheee: XD IT'S WORST
[2022-09-07T00:39:41] rosheee: btw
[2022-09-07T00:39:43] Mirko Boni: Exactly üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2022-09-07T00:39:48] rosheee: when u add washers on front inside
[2022-09-07T00:39:52] rosheee: that monorim is straight
[2022-09-07T00:40:25] Mirko Boni: So now it's crooked inward? It's wrong?
[2022-09-07T00:42:16] rosheee: <photos/photo_5991@07-09-2022_00-42-16.jpg>
[2022-09-07T00:42:17] rosheee: when washers inside on front monorim is / to brake disc
[2022-09-07T00:43:05] rosheee: RED has to be 160mm
[2022-09-07T00:43:05] rosheee: <photos/photo_5992@07-09-2022_00-43-05.jpg>
[2022-09-07T00:43:14] rosheee: then | straight
[2022-09-07T00:44:04] Mirko Boni: Mmmm ok ok! But 160 mm is 16 cm!
[2022-09-07T00:44:44] Mirko Boni: Because you have the bespoke monorim made by you!
[2022-09-07T00:46:50] rosheee: i bend it by hand XD
[2022-09-07T00:46:55] rosheee: NO
[2022-09-07T00:47:05] rosheee: sry
[2022-09-07T00:47:07] rosheee: 16mm XD
[2022-09-07T00:47:08] Mirko Boni: Woow!

[2022-09-07T00:47:35] rosheee: ZERO10X LM 6phase motors were suc√©
[2022-09-07T00:47:41] Mirko Boni: I have to measure then!
[2022-09-07T00:47:46] rosheee: yes
[2022-09-07T00:47:58] rosheee: u have to bend here

[2022-09-07T00:48:18] Mirko Boni: Woow
[2022-09-07T00:48:29] Mirko Boni: Ok ok perfect
[2022-09-07T00:53:13] rosheee: btw nice bolts on monorim
[2022-09-07T00:56:20] Jan: These brackets üò¨ I bought some of those. Worst material and the cheapest manufacturing process known to mankind. Be careful with it
[2022-09-07T00:57:09] Mirko Boni: @roscheeee I measured according to your directions! I removed the front wheel bolts! I measured 15mm
[2022-09-07T00:58:07] Mirko Boni: Hello, are you talking about the dualtron adapter for the caliper?
[2022-09-07T00:58:25] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_5995@07-09-2022_00-58-25.jpg>
[2022-09-07T00:58:31] rosheee: yep ^^'
[2022-09-07T00:58:36] Mirko Boni: Am I talking about this?
[2022-09-07T00:58:45] rosheee: but they worked for me
[2022-09-07T00:58:50] rosheee: the dualtron adapters
[2022-09-07T00:58:54] rosheee: use m6
[2022-09-07T00:59:12] Mirko Boni: Not fit M5?
[2022-09-07T00:59:13] rosheee: if your friend can make u new ones then make new ones xD
[2022-09-07T00:59:26] rosheee: original is m5, right?
[2022-09-07T00:59:44] Mirko Boni: I have to ask him if he can produce them!
[2022-09-07T00:59:59] Mirko Boni: No! M4 original
[2022-09-07T01:00:40] Jan: If you can, make a steel bracket
[2022-09-07T01:00:42] Mirko Boni: Se faccio il foro M6 allora mangio tutto il ferro attorno al foro originale!
[2022-09-07T01:00:53] Mirko Boni: If I make the M6 ‚Äã‚Äãhole then I eat all the iron around the original hole!
[2022-09-07T01:01:17] Mirko Boni: OK! I got it!
[2022-09-07T01:01:24] Jan: 0.1cent chinesium adapter is separating your life from death
[2022-09-07T01:01:33] Mirko Boni: Are these bought from China dangerous?
[2022-09-07T01:02:05] Mirko Boni: Grazie jan! Ho capito cosa intendi tu!
[2022-09-07T01:02:05] rosheee: <photos/photo_5839@24-08-2022_19-27-21.jpg>
[2022-09-07T01:02:24] rosheee: ^^ i had no probs but yah xD
[2022-09-07T01:02:33] Mirko Boni: Grazie jan! Ho capito cosa intendi tu!
[2022-09-07T01:02:38] Jan: Dualtron bracket aluminium in a stamping process. It would not be so critical wouldnt it be for the sharp corners. Chance for a crack starting there
[2022-09-07T01:02:40] rosheee: Btw@jan u used them rear
[2022-09-07T01:02:44] Mirko Boni: Thanks jan! I understand what you mean!
[2022-09-07T01:02:49] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-09-07T01:03:12] rosheee: So i had luck for 25000km xD with same adapters
[2022-09-07T01:03:18] Jan: The Comet Airplanes from the 1950 had sharp corners. All failed, all humans died
[2022-09-07T01:03:24] Mirko Boni: But now I'm afraid! Is it sure it breaks?
[2022-09-07T01:03:43] Jan: No its not certain that it breaks but it can
[2022-09-07T01:04:22] Mirko Boni: So tomorrow I take the piece to my mechanic friend and ask him to make two in steel!
[2022-09-07T01:04:44] Jan: Avoid sharp corners
[2022-09-07T01:05:09] Mirko Boni: I'll show him your photos!
[2022-09-07T01:05:49] rosheee: friend and me also made one for jan
[2022-09-07T01:05:50] rosheee: for rear

[2022-09-07T01:05:55] rosheee: i stick to dualtron xD
[2022-09-07T01:06:21] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-09-07T01:06:36] Jan: Steel is 3x stronger than aluminium
[2022-09-07T01:06:51] Mirko Boni: Are you speaking German? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2022-09-07T01:07:17] Mirko Boni: Yes jan, I'll have them made in steel
[2022-09-07T01:07:21] Jan: Dont forget that saving 15grams while going there on aluminium on a 30kg scooter isnt worth it
[2022-09-07T01:07:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: 6 wire*
[2022-09-07T01:07:52] Mirko Boni: Ninth! I understand! I don't do anything that can kill me!
[2022-09-07T01:08:16] rosheee: i still use dualtron on 20s

[2022-09-07T01:10:13] Mirko Boni: Roger, can you sell me 2 steel adapters?
[2022-09-07T01:10:50] Jan: Pictures might be a bit dated
[2022-09-07T01:11:10] rosheee: have to ask friend if he can make more
[2022-09-07T01:11:11] rosheee: ^^
[2022-09-07T01:11:47] Mirko Boni: Thank you! If you can ask, I would need it! So no disturbing my friend!
[2022-09-07T01:12:00] Jan: I can scan and make a production run
[2022-09-07T01:12:11] Mirko Boni: Anche a te @AJAJ1992! Se ne hai te li compro!

[2022-09-07T01:12:57] Mirko Boni: Ha ha ha ha ha it's true you told me you were going on vacation!
[2022-09-07T01:13:23] Jan: The idea is to make a monorim kit for 10x3 hub motors
[2022-09-07T01:13:37] Jan: But i need to buy a scanner first
[2022-09-07T01:13:38] Mirko Boni: Woow!
[2022-09-07T01:14:12] Mirko Boni: Do you manufacture these parts for G30?
[2022-09-07T01:14:55] Jan: I outsource manufacturing, i will only do design
[2022-09-07T01:15:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: Xbox 360 scanner is really good lol
[2022-09-07T01:16:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: I send you for free in rosche package if u want

[2022-09-07T07:05:55] sombre_enfant: It fit
[2022-09-07T07:55:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I repeated motor setup and increased sensorless erpm, works much better now. Still a little bit of vibration, but I will just increase it a little further.
[2022-09-07T07:57:07] Mirono escooters: Increases erpm? I lowered it
[2022-09-07T08:01:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: You did? Hmm
[2022-09-07T08:01:27] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I have it on 6000 atm
[2022-09-07T08:01:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: from 4000
[2022-09-07T08:04:24] Mirono escooters: üò±
[2022-09-07T08:04:28] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I will try it as well later.
[2022-09-07T11:23:48] rosheee: Hallsensor sensorless?
[2022-09-07T11:24:11] rosheee: I use 600 sensorless 400 int.
[2022-09-07T11:24:22] rosheee: Works better
[2022-09-07T11:24:33] rosheee: What values u get when do motortest?

[2022-09-07T11:41:30] rosheee: Vibration only when start
[2022-09-07T11:41:33] rosheee: Until sensorless
[2022-09-07T11:41:43] rosheee: And hallsensor detect all good?
[2022-09-07T11:45:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes only at start, but I have now changed settings and will retry when it's dry outside.
[2022-09-07T11:45:14] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Should be alright.
[2022-09-07T11:45:47] rosheee: Strange Pid. Settings? What u changed?
[2022-09-07T11:46:05] rosheee: Had that with cheap motors

[2022-09-07T11:46:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and enabled bemf
[2022-09-07T11:47:24] rosheee: Try also sensorless mode
[2022-09-07T11:47:28] rosheee: These values
[2022-09-07T11:47:49] rosheee: <photos/photo_6007@07-09-2022_11-47-49.jpg>

[2022-09-07T11:50:54] rosheee: <photos/photo_6009@07-09-2022_11-50-54.jpg>
[2022-09-07T11:51:01] rosheee: Otherwise reflash FW xD bootloader and go again

[2022-09-07T12:39:31] rosheee: ABS OVERCURRENT
[2022-09-07T12:39:32] rosheee: lol xD
[2022-09-07T12:39:47] rosheee: can u show the full settings
[2022-09-07T12:39:50] rosheee: everything
[2022-09-07T12:39:57] rosheee: send xml?
[2022-09-07T12:40:01] rosheee: and reflash the firmware
[2022-09-07T12:40:13] rosheee: absolute over current error lol
[2022-09-07T12:52:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: one sec
[2022-09-07T12:54:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Setting sensorless erpm to 8000 works the best, but the down side of it is poor acceleration and it feels unsmooth and noisy. Will send settings when I get back
[2022-09-07T12:54:38] rosheee: hallsensor maybe teh setting
[2022-09-07T12:54:44] rosheee: will see when u send xml file ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2022-09-07T12:55:08] rosheee: but something rly not g00d reflash firmware as well btw u use spintend fw, right?
[2022-09-07T12:59:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: compiled from their github hwconf
[2022-09-07T12:59:09] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: they do not offer 6.0 firmware
[2022-09-07T12:59:19] rosheee: ^^ maybe that's the problem
[2022-09-07T12:59:27] rosheee: try with 5.3fw from spintend
[2022-09-07T12:59:36] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_6010@07-09-2022_12-59-36.jpg>
[2022-09-07T12:59:38] Mirono escooters: Jaj magura
[2022-09-07T12:59:38] rosheee: spintend will be in version 6.0
[2022-09-07T12:59:40] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I can't.
[2022-09-07T12:59:49] rosheee: why u can't xD?
[2022-09-07T12:59:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I need 6.0
[2022-09-07T13:00:00] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: because of Lisp
[2022-09-07T13:00:42] rosheee: ^^ sad
[2022-09-07T13:00:54] rosheee: try fw 5.3 and if same issue then we know more
[2022-09-07T13:01:09] rosheee: maybe it is rly 6.0 issue
[2022-09-07T13:02:21] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I don't think so tbh. They even made the hwconf for the single 100v and 6.0 was working for me on Flipsky without any issues.
[2022-09-07T13:02:33] rosheee: yes but this fliposky
[2022-09-07T13:02:36] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: man shit I should have left a usb cable out of the frame.

[2022-09-07T13:03:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yeah I am connected over bridge
[2022-09-07T13:03:49] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: over phone no problem, but no idea where the files are going
[2022-09-07T13:05:38] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: ok I am dumb
[2022-09-07T13:05:40] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: wrong button

[2022-09-07T13:12:01] rosheee: jup
[2022-09-07T13:12:01] rosheee: sry
[2022-09-07T13:12:02] rosheee: saw it
[2022-09-07T13:12:07] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: with these settings it does not work at all
[2022-09-07T13:12:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: not even when motor current set below 100
[2022-09-07T13:12:24] rosheee: ^^
[2022-09-07T13:12:27] rosheee: just for a try
[2022-09-07T13:12:31] rosheee: upload 5.3 and see if works
[2022-09-07T13:12:36] rosheee: xd then it works 1337%
[2022-09-07T13:12:40] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but I can't test it
[2022-09-07T13:12:53] rosheee: why xd?
[2022-09-07T13:13:00] rosheee: u can test if motor and shit works
[2022-09-07T13:13:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: because no throttle connected to vesc
[2022-09-07T13:13:05] rosheee: ah lol
[2022-09-07T13:13:05] rosheee: XD
[2022-09-07T13:13:08] rosheee: #fail
[2022-09-07T13:14:47] sombre_enfant: What it do ?
[2022-09-07T13:14:52] sombre_enfant: N
[2022-09-07T13:14:56] rosheee: what
[2022-09-07T13:28:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Ok interesting ü§î Redone motor setup, this time set everything back to default. Means it is back to 30kHz, which overloaded CPU and killed the script.
[2022-09-07T13:34:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Not so good. Lost throttle control for 1 sec... Anyone knows what chip the Single Ubox is using? It has to be less powerful than the Flipsky 75100.
[2022-09-07T13:51:14] Mirono escooters: Oof
[2022-09-07T13:52:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Shrinked whole script to the most essential parts and still using 25-30% CPU.
[2022-09-07T13:53:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I can only try if it will work now, but my guess is that the Single Ubox is not powerful enough (in terms of cpu power) for 30kHz (with a Lisp script running).
[2022-09-07T13:54:48] Mirono escooters: üòÜ
[2022-09-07T13:54:53] Mirono escooters: F
[2022-09-07T13:54:58] Mirono escooters: Thats pretty shit
[2022-09-07T13:55:50] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, it is. It would be a deal breaker for me, tbh it already is at the current state.
[2022-09-07T13:56:22] Mirono escooters: Flipsky beat it with cheaper esc üíÄ
[2022-09-07T14:00:16] sombre_enfant: Put 16khz
[2022-09-07T14:01:25] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 20 works fine with full script
[2022-09-07T14:01:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 30 works too, but only with throttle input and display data. No button logic or anything else or it will crash
[2022-09-07T14:02:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: What cpu ubox use?
[2022-09-07T14:06:16] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I don't know. Wondering the same.
[2022-09-07T14:06:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: So how ubox use more cpu than others?
[2022-09-07T14:06:57] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: By having worse cpu?
[2022-09-07T14:07:40] Mirono escooters: Cheeaping out
[2022-09-07T14:07:49] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: man I should have not ruined my flipsky heatsink by drilling holes into it for the Ubox. Did not expect it to be so bad.
[2022-09-07T14:08:02] Mirono escooters: F
[2022-09-07T14:08:03] sombre_enfant: üòÇüòÇ
[2022-09-07T14:08:09] Mirono escooters: Its pretty shite if i hear it
[2022-09-07T14:09:28] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: temps worse cpu performance worse motors goes BrBrbRbRBbRbRB (shake) bRbRBBr at least they have official hw conf for firmware upgrade.
[2022-09-07T14:10:00] sombre_enfant: Do 20s flipsky
[2022-09-07T14:10:31] S1m 0n: more appearance than reality, as so often? hyped by someone and when you have it in front of you everything is completely different
[2022-09-07T14:11:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: That's where the MOSFETs of the Flipsky 75100 sit normally, but no I thought I would go for the ubox and drilled two fat holes into it üòµ‚Äçüí´
[2022-09-07T14:11:31] sombre_enfant: Damn
[2022-09-07T14:11:50] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Hope I can cover it up with something thermally conductive in case I cannot manage to fix my motor vibration issue.
[2022-09-07T14:34:13] Mirono escooters: Nooo
[2022-09-07T14:40:38] rosheee: just use 5.3
[2022-09-07T14:41:06] S1m 0n: 5.3 don't support lisp !
[2022-09-07T14:41:13] rosheee: Yes
[2022-09-07T14:41:18] rosheee: but I SAY THEN IT WORKS 99%
[2022-09-07T14:41:47] S1m 0n: Without Dash from Mi he can't throttle
[2022-09-07T14:42:01] rosheee: he can unsolder it for testing ^^
[2022-09-07T14:42:10] rosheee: or even try it with keyboard
[2022-09-07T14:42:13] S1m 0n: Yes that's possible ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2022-09-07T14:42:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It will only happen under load.
[2022-09-07T14:42:33] S1m 0n: Keyboard is not real behavior like on the street
[2022-09-07T14:43:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and "John" did publish these hwconfs.
[2022-09-07T14:43:19] rosheee: or u can mix 6.0 x 5.3 from spintend
[2022-09-07T14:43:36] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: wdym mix?
[2022-09-07T14:43:47] rosheee: this is 6.0?
[2022-09-07T14:43:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes.
[2022-09-07T14:44:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: these files are used to compile 6.0 firmware for ubo single 100v (or other uboxes)
[2022-09-07T14:44:31] rosheee: ok
[2022-09-07T14:44:37] rosheee: what motor u use?
[2022-09-07T14:44:39] rosheee: the blade one?
[2022-09-07T14:44:45] rosheee: reflash firmware and bootloader
[2022-09-07T14:44:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes. Blade 1200w.
[2022-09-07T14:45:01] rosheee: then do whole setup again u know how it works right
[2022-09-07T14:45:10] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Of course lol
[2022-09-07T14:48:07] rosheee: what observer type u using?
[2022-09-07T14:49:09] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <photos/photo_6015@07-09-2022_14-49-09.jpg>
[2022-09-07T14:49:13] rosheee: u have ortega?
[2022-09-07T14:49:25] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: set by default
[2022-09-07T14:49:32] rosheee: try ortega
[2022-09-07T14:49:45] rosheee: and take out FW
[2022-09-07T14:49:49] rosheee: and redo hall sensor
[2022-09-07T14:49:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: which one?
[2022-09-07T14:50:02] rosheee: original
[2022-09-07T14:50:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: ok
[2022-09-07T14:50:13] rosheee: and redo hallsensor detection with 10A
[2022-09-07T14:50:32] rosheee: and set sensorless erpm and interpo. to default
[2022-09-07T14:50:54] rosheee: <photos/photo_6017@07-09-2022_14-50-54.jpg>
[2022-09-07T14:51:13] rosheee: and this
[2022-09-07T14:51:14] rosheee: <photos/photo_6018@07-09-2022_14-51-14.jpg>
[2022-09-07T14:51:22] rosheee: and go to laptop
[2022-09-07T14:51:26] rosheee: and then realtime data
[2022-09-07T14:52:14] rosheee: then rotor position
[2022-09-07T14:52:20] rosheee: PID position
[2022-09-07T14:52:28] rosheee: then the degrees u get ther u put in PID controllers
[2022-09-07T14:52:53] rosheee: <photos/photo_6019@07-09-2022_14-52-53.jpg>
[2022-09-07T14:53:00] rosheee: set there the degrees and apply
[2022-09-07T14:53:36] rosheee: and
[2022-09-07T14:53:39] rosheee: to 0.05
[2022-09-07T14:53:42] rosheee: then test
[2022-09-07T15:10:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I think it works
[2022-09-07T15:11:25] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No vibration at all, done everything you told me. Pulls less now, about 129A max motor current, setting is still set to 135A. But
[2022-09-07T15:11:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: it feels smooth
[2022-09-07T15:17:31] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @roscheeee But why? Like, what on earth is different with this observer?
[2022-09-07T15:18:15] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: There is also one thing that I noticed, my Ubox always shows a duty of ~-0,7% duty. ü§®
[2022-09-07T15:22:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Here, deep slope upwards, constantly ~130A motor current but no vibration anymore.
[2022-09-07T15:31:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and I hope I can fix thermals tomorrow with new paste.
[2022-09-07T15:33:21] rosheee: ^^
[2022-09-07T15:33:26] rosheee: it works with the observer?
[2022-09-07T15:34:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes.
[2022-09-07T15:34:13] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It does. Thank you.
[2022-09-07T15:37:39] S1m 0n: Roscheee üî•üíì
[2022-09-07T15:38:29] Mirono escooters: Observer does what exactly?
[2022-09-07T15:39:17] sombre_enfant: Temp higher than fs
[2022-09-07T15:39:30] rosheee: checks ur anus
[2022-09-07T15:39:36] rosheee: no :D
[2022-09-07T15:39:46] rosheee: rifk temo
[2022-09-07T15:39:48] rosheee: NOW
[2022-09-07T15:39:53] rosheee: put the hall sensor values
[2022-09-07T15:39:55] rosheee: and 20khz
[2022-09-07T15:39:58] rosheee: ZVF
[2022-09-07T15:40:03] rosheee: 600 and 400 for hall
[2022-09-07T15:40:08] rosheee: then fuckeria + 1
[2022-09-07T15:40:12] rosheee: + back emf decoupl.
[2022-09-07T15:40:14] rosheee: more fuckeria
[2022-09-07T15:40:20] rosheee: then allow brake false
[2022-09-07T15:40:24] rosheee: and all other crap i wrote
[2022-09-07T15:41:30] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, but I think that's because I had to reuse the old thermal paste on my scooter frame... Tomorrow I get new one. It heats up the copper heatsink but heat does not go to frame.
[2022-09-07T15:41:41] rosheee: and XD BRAKE CURRENT OMG and the other current which has "-"
[2022-09-07T15:41:46] rosheee: put that lower or to 0
[2022-09-07T15:42:24] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @roscheeee alright üëç
[2022-09-07T15:44:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It determines the rotor position, but I don't know what exactly the different methods do.
[2022-09-07T15:44:56] Mirono escooters: Guess ill mess with it
[2022-09-07T15:47:05] Artem Bulashev: You don‚Äôt need to compile
[2022-09-07T15:47:20] Artem Bulashev: Ubox will be in official Vesc Tool
[2022-09-07T15:47:35] Artem Bulashev: Just selectable thus
[2022-09-07T15:47:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, I know. It is there.
[2022-09-07T15:48:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <photos/photo_6021@07-09-2022_15-48-02.jpg>
[2022-09-07T15:49:04] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But that's what I meant with they provide official hwconf.
[2022-09-07T16:14:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: I do üòÅ
[2022-09-07T16:15:29] Jan: <animation>
[2022-09-07T18:11:31] S1m 0n: is this data variable?
[2022-09-07T18:11:32] S1m 0n: <photos/photo_6023@07-09-2022_18-11-32.jpg>
[2022-09-07T18:12:08] rosheee: but looks good
[2022-09-07T18:12:23] rosheee: yes
[2022-09-07T18:12:28] S1m 0n: That's two different motors, but I'm sure they are same
[2022-09-07T18:12:41] rosheee: never use fan
[2022-09-07T18:12:47] rosheee: i send video of bms temp
[2022-09-07T18:12:59] rosheee: max 40 degrees at +30C ambient
[2022-09-07T18:13:35] rosheee: yes
[2022-09-07T18:15:54] S1m 0n: So looks like same motor, right ?

[2022-09-07T18:16:21] Artem Bulashev: I think I found perfect light
[2022-09-07T18:16:28] rosheee: all is good
[2022-09-07T18:16:31] Mirono escooters: With this info only not sayable
[2022-09-07T18:16:32] rosheee: the resistance is a bit ^^' very high
[2022-09-07T18:17:06] S1m 0n: Maybe coz how I test üòÖ
[2022-09-07T18:17:27] rosheee: lol wtf phase connectors
[2022-09-07T18:17:33] S1m 0n: How I can check it clearly ?
[2022-09-07T18:17:43] rosheee: what u wanan check?
[2022-09-07T18:18:08] rosheee: can u send closeup pic from how u connected phase?
[2022-09-07T18:18:11] S1m 0n: Is 48V/1000W Motor the same as 60V/1000W Motor
[2022-09-07T18:18:19] rosheee: no
[2022-09-07T18:18:31] rosheee: I THINK NO XD mabe i am wrong
[2022-09-07T18:18:39] S1m 0n: I'm think yes
[2022-09-07T18:18:50] rosheee: rated 60V 1000W
[2022-09-07T18:18:55] rosheee: the other is 48V @ 1000w
[2022-09-07T18:19:08] S1m 0n: The 48V/1000W motor not realy exist. It's a 48V/800W Engine
[2022-09-07T18:19:23] rosheee: so what is the question ^^'?
[2022-09-07T18:19:42] rosheee: and what is that green shizzl on phase?
[2022-09-07T18:19:46] S1m 0n: 48V/800W = 16,666667A 60V/1000W= 16,66666,7A
[2022-09-07T18:20:05] rosheee: what 16A?
[2022-09-07T18:20:07] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6031@07-09-2022_18-20-07.jpg>
[2022-09-07T18:20:14] Artem Bulashev: 30w real
[2022-09-07T18:20:29] rosheee: still don't like that beams
[2022-09-07T18:20:44] rosheee: but i stfu about beamz and lampz 4ever
[2022-09-07T18:21:12] S1m 0n: From kaabo
[2022-09-07T18:21:36] Artem Bulashev: Focus is 8x3m (that is wider than almost all AliExpress lamps in both direction) + good additional bright area under
[2022-09-07T18:21:40] S1m 0n: But i have bullet
[2022-09-07T18:22:13] rosheee: i compared the 4mm bullets to 5,6 ,7 and 8 ^^
[2022-09-07T18:22:36] S1m 0n: No I don't need with 13s and maybe wanted 35-40A
[2022-09-07T18:23:06] Artem Bulashev: Also have this
[2022-09-07T18:23:17] Artem Bulashev: A lot higher beam
[2022-09-07T18:23:24] Artem Bulashev: 40w
[2022-09-07T18:23:47] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6035@07-09-2022_18-23-47.jpg>
[2022-09-07T18:24:11] Artem Bulashev: But size is not small though 50 x56 is ok
[2022-09-07T18:24:47] S1m 0n: You won't make any friends with it if you set the angle too high ü§£. I have the IQ-X E (do not know how many watts that has) and since I hear again and again from cycling that hurts the eyes
[2022-09-07T18:25:53] Artem Bulashev: Those are sharp shadow line - so won‚Äôt hurt eyes - and to see higher there is high beam
[2022-09-07T18:26:05] Artem Bulashev: I‚Äôm - one lamp scooter person
[2022-09-07T18:26:14] Artem Bulashev: Don‚Äôt want 4 lamps all over place
[2022-09-07T18:26:59] Artem Bulashev: Holly shit
[2022-09-07T18:27:08] Artem Bulashev: It does 60w with high + low
[2022-09-07T18:27:47] S1m 0n: ü§£
[2022-09-07T18:28:03] Artem Bulashev: Well it makes sense
[2022-09-07T18:28:08] Artem Bulashev: 3 20w leds
[2022-09-07T18:28:32] Artem Bulashev: It takes 8-90v
[2022-09-07T18:28:39] Artem Bulashev: But 60‚Ç¨ lamps hmmm
[2022-09-07T18:29:06] S1m 0n: When you take a break and leave the lamp on, you can also cook something on it
[2022-09-07T18:33:37] S1m 0n: How to determine this accurately? Someone tells me to measure the consumption at idle (0.6A both in first gear). In second gear both 1A and in third gear both 1.4A). Is this meaningful ? (via SmartBMS)
[2022-09-07T18:34:17] Mirono escooters: Well i bet 60v and 48v only diff kv
[2022-09-07T18:35:39] S1m 0n: How to check that? I could not notice any difference when driving. Not in acceleration or terminal velocity. Also not when starting on the hill
[2022-09-07T18:35:52] rosheee: speed
[2022-09-07T18:35:57] rosheee: low kv = more torque less topspeed
[2022-09-07T18:36:03] rosheee: high kv = less torque and more speed0
[2022-09-07T18:36:34] S1m 0n: Look how similar ü§£
[2022-09-07T18:37:22] S1m 0n: So both in idle 64kmh, means not same KV?
[2022-09-07T18:42:05] rosheee: with 13S?
[2022-09-07T18:42:36] Mirono escooters: Excactly the same the'
[2022-09-07T18:45:06] rosheee: yes
[2022-09-07T18:45:08] rosheee: so cam
[2022-09-07T18:46:16] S1m 0n: I said on idle, not on street. And my battery is not full now.. maybe I can found a old video
[2022-09-07T18:49:39] S1m 0n: Okay my bad 62kmh with stock china battery
[2022-09-07T18:53:21] S1m 0n: That's from the weekend for testing, but I'm not sure, how accurate 255mm as Wheeldiagram is ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2022-09-07T18:58:16] rosheee: not very
[2022-09-07T18:58:25] rosheee: tuovt?
[2022-09-07T18:58:30] rosheee: i use 244 on pmt
[2022-09-07T19:00:40] S1m 0n: Dont know it's printed HT
[2022-09-07T19:00:59] rosheee: HT

[2022-09-07T19:02:42] rosheee: ah
[2022-09-07T19:02:48] rosheee: @artBula how many LUX?
[2022-09-07T19:03:23] Mirono escooters: Thats tuovt rebrand
[2022-09-07T19:20:01] sombre_enfant: Put 246
[2022-09-07T19:20:08] rosheee: size of ur dick?
[2022-09-07T19:32:58] rosheee: LOL TRONIC BLOCKED MY IP ADRESS XD
[2022-09-07T19:33:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: Reboot modem xd
[2022-09-07T19:33:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: Then air mode ur phone and turn off
[2022-09-07T19:37:28] Mirono escooters: Impossible. Hard working americans.. they would never do that
[2022-09-07T19:37:55] Mirono escooters: U got scammed
[2022-09-07T19:39:23] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I am using 242 on 10" CST
[2022-09-07T19:46:25] S1m 0n: Yes, I know that 255 is not correct. but without an extra throttle I can't test on the street either (or is it too much work for me, take the display apart, adapt the plugs in the battery compartment)
[2022-09-07T19:57:40] rosheee: Now I neeed dash as well omg
[2022-09-07T19:59:13] rosheee: Cuz mobile wont fit on scooter omg
[2022-09-07T19:59:38] Artem Bulashev: How many you killed ?
[2022-09-07T19:59:59] Artem Bulashev: It doesn‚Äôt state
[2022-09-07T20:00:04] Artem Bulashev: None of them do
[2022-09-07T20:00:34] Artem Bulashev: The one with 3 double-led has 15000lumen
[2022-09-07T20:01:01] Artem Bulashev: So 5000lumen per eye is quite fair rating
[2022-09-07T20:01:29] Artem Bulashev: There are some leds that can do 7000 and 10000 but more expensive
[2022-09-07T20:01:46] Artem Bulashev: 8-90v converter comes with it
[2022-09-07T20:20:46] Luis Magalhaes: Use a vpn üòÇ
[2022-09-07T20:23:45] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6038@07-09-2022_20-23-45.jpg>
[2022-09-07T20:28:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: all vescs use stm32f405rgt6
[2022-09-07T20:30:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: did you save the official firmware. recompile without the exact/good h file is pretty risky (many params in this file, should use any alternative file if not the official or hacked/decompiled file)
[2022-09-07T20:31:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: good !
[2022-09-07T20:32:27] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: From what I think now is probably the new merged changes of the Lisp branch the reason for it to take up more CPU utilisation, compared to my Flipsky 75100 running firmware from a month ago.
[2022-09-07T20:33:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: good !
[2022-09-07T20:35:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: lisp suport is still beta and it's interpreted, not compiled, so yes, it need a lot of cpu ü´§
[2022-09-07T20:36:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it would be better to build a vesc firmware with additionnal c/c++ code to support xiaomi dash
[2022-09-07T20:37:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: I see the software can be adapter in more type of cpu like f407, I‚Äôm not sure
[2022-09-07T20:37:27] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, that would be awesome. Maybe I do it. But if I remember correctly there is a way to load native code via Lisp, so maybe that could be an alternative.
[2022-09-07T20:38:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: port is always possible. jens ported many parts of vesc code on stm32f103 and gd32f103/303... but it's not so simple üòÖ
[2022-09-07T20:39:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i doubt vesc integrate a lisp compiler, but may be i'm missing something üòÖ
[2022-09-07T20:40:19] Mirono escooters: Jens boss
[2022-09-07T20:40:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, I don't think so as well, but there was something in the changes about calling native libraries, so maybe interop compatibility.
[2022-09-07T20:52:58] Artem Bulashev: What did you do to solve ?
[2022-09-07T20:53:16] rosheee: the shizzl i told him observer
[2022-09-07T20:54:01] Artem Bulashev: What is observer ?
[2022-09-07T20:54:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: How fixed
[2022-09-07T20:54:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: this shit helped a lot, read down below everything
[2022-09-07T20:55:11] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: When thermals fixed tomorrow. I will apply no hw limits firmware and try to push more current üòÖ
[2022-09-07T20:56:27] Artem Bulashev: Which controller you use ubox 75100?
[2022-09-07T20:56:39] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: ubox single 100v 100a
[2022-09-07T20:56:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if i understood correctly, it's how raw data are monitored and give feedback to regulation loops (speed/position/torque). it can integrate different algorithms/filters.
[2022-09-07T20:56:52] Artem Bulashev: Copper ?
[2022-09-07T20:56:53] rosheee: how much u push now ^^'?
[2022-09-07T20:57:21] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: ~130A, settings set to 135A. I need more.
[2022-09-07T20:58:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Hw limit in firmware is set to 135A so I cannot set it higher, need to compile no limits fw tomorrow.
[2022-09-07T20:58:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes
[2022-09-07T20:58:21] rosheee: lol u need more xD?
[2022-09-07T20:58:23] rosheee: i use 135A
[2022-09-07T20:58:25] rosheee: 16S
[2022-09-07T20:58:29] rosheee: and how many battery xD?
[2022-09-07T20:58:36] Artem Bulashev: And how many battery amps set?
[2022-09-07T20:58:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 15S 60A, when done with batt 22S 60A/70A.
[2022-09-07T20:58:56] rosheee: lol
[2022-09-07T20:58:57] rosheee: XD
[2022-09-07T20:59:03] rosheee: PUT 90A BATTERY
[2022-09-07T20:59:11] rosheee: then use 135A phase
[2022-09-07T20:59:16] sombre_enfant: Bruh
[2022-09-07T20:59:20] rosheee: me boi
[2022-09-07T20:59:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Don't know how much 60A LLT can handle.
[2022-09-07T20:59:35] sombre_enfant: Put 180A phase then
[2022-09-07T20:59:41] rosheee: daly 60A can handle 200A
[2022-09-07T20:59:45] rosheee: 120A cont.
[2022-09-07T20:59:49] rosheee: but daly shit ^^
[2022-09-07T20:59:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: For my other batt no problem, going to be 100A LLT, but my internal is only 60A.
[2022-09-07T20:59:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: <sticker>
[2022-09-07T21:00:01] Artem Bulashev: That will only change top speed acceleration only (above 40kmh)
[2022-09-07T21:00:24] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: on front motor? rip my wheels üòÖ
[2022-09-07T21:00:26] Artem Bulashev: 70a at most I would not push too much
[2022-09-07T21:00:26] sombre_enfant: 100A llt do 22s?it say 21s on their site
[2022-09-07T21:00:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: That depends by motor type
[2022-09-07T21:00:45] rosheee: i use 60A front 70A rear
[2022-09-07T21:00:46] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It does to from 4s to 22S, but it is going to be used for additional 7s.
[2022-09-07T21:00:50] sombre_enfant: Yeah un-drivable on front
[2022-09-07T21:00:53] rosheee: no
[2022-09-07T21:00:54] rosheee: me fat
[2022-09-07T21:00:56] rosheee: so weight front
[2022-09-07T21:01:01] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-09-07T21:01:20] sombre_enfant: 60kg wheel spin at 90A
[2022-09-07T21:01:27] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I am fat. I accelerate so slow.
[2022-09-07T21:01:36] rosheee: me2
[2022-09-07T21:01:39] rosheee: i am fatter than you
[2022-09-07T21:01:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Bet üò¨
[2022-09-07T21:01:52] Artem Bulashev: 60a battery and 135a phase is perfectly good
[2022-09-07T21:01:58] Artem Bulashev: It should not over heat
[2022-09-07T21:02:25] rosheee: yes
[2022-09-07T21:02:26] Artem Bulashev: Put 0.5mm thermal pad beteen vesc and deck 15m/k
[2022-09-07T21:02:27] rosheee: it doesn't
[2022-09-07T21:02:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But I don't know, it does not feel like 130A-135A with the other observer, probably too smooth now lol üòÇ
[2022-09-07T21:02:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I will try to put graphite thermal pad
[2022-09-07T21:02:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: See how it performs ü§∑
[2022-09-07T21:03:15] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But I have no deck, it is mounted to yet another copper heatsink... which is then mounted to scooter.
[2022-09-07T21:04:16] Artem Bulashev: Why?
[2022-09-07T21:04:26] Artem Bulashev: Why not directly to scooter body?
[2022-09-07T21:05:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Because I don't want to drill more holes into scooter and because the heatsink was already designed to be mounted there. Was made for Flipsky 75100, which was mounted directly with MOSFETs, but now Ubox sits on it.
[2022-09-07T21:05:38] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2022-09-07T21:06:11] Artem Bulashev: Mounting fets directly to heatsink should be more effective
[2022-09-07T21:06:35] Artem Bulashev: 90 degree standing fets ? from flipsky 75100 black brick like?
[2022-09-07T21:07:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you prepare escooters for customers or it's for you ?
[2022-09-07T21:07:50] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: .
[2022-09-07T21:07:57] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Always for me.
[2022-09-07T21:08:20] Artem Bulashev: Dammm üòÑüòÑüòÑ
[2022-09-07T21:08:59] Artem Bulashev: 100v fets have higher IR so will heat up more on its self than 75v fets
[2022-09-07T21:09:31] Artem Bulashev: So that‚Äôs why you will see worse thermals from 100v ubox single VS 75v controller
[2022-09-07T21:09:45] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Flipsky is 100v as well
[2022-09-07T21:10:00] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and I had other MOSFETs on there too.
[2022-09-07T21:10:24] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <photos/photo_6039@07-09-2022_21-10-24.jpg>
[2022-09-07T21:10:24] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <photos/photo_6040@07-09-2022_21-10-24.jpg>
[2022-09-07T21:11:15] Artem Bulashev: Says 84v yeah
[2022-09-07T21:12:08] Artem Bulashev: Wonder if it will live long
[2022-09-07T21:12:24] Artem Bulashev: 100v single ubox says 93v max
[2022-09-07T21:12:36] Artem Bulashev: 22s
[2022-09-07T21:13:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ü§£ü§£ü§£
[2022-09-07T21:13:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, I hope so, but they even said that regenerative braking would work (I will not use it, too risky).
[2022-09-07T21:16:25] S1m 0n: if you always push things to the limit, they just break down faster. rather calculate larger ones and use less
[2022-09-07T22:23:35] francois schempers: finally replaced the bms in a friend's scooter, it's a Vesc sleeper, I didn't do any cable management because fuck it, if it work, it's good ü§£ü§£

[2022-09-08T02:24:20] Artem Bulashev: Damm that is nice and High beam and wide too‚Ä¶ 26w real power i seems. Only downside it doesn‚Äôt have Low+high together
[2022-09-08T02:34:50] Artem Bulashev: This one has low + high = in that mode it does 60w supposedly üòÖ comes with dcdc relay driver ready In that size for 35$ looks like a bargain
[2022-09-08T02:39:34] Luis Magalhaes: Whats the name of this one?
[2022-09-08T02:48:05] Artem Bulashev: LX18 by cnsunnylight
[2022-09-08T02:59:53] Artem Bulashev: I didn‚Äôt like yellow
[2022-09-08T03:00:03] Artem Bulashev: But asking now if they can sell white + white
[2022-09-08T03:00:34] Artem Bulashev: In their video they show such, but they don‚Äôt have such option on Aliexpress
[2022-09-08T03:09:26] Luis Magalhaes: üëç
[2022-09-08T03:09:39] Luis Magalhaes: They look good

[2022-09-08T03:10:15] Artem Bulashev: I will let you know when they tell me if available
[2022-09-08T03:10:40] Artem Bulashev: ‚ÄúIf you need dual white, you need wait about 10days.‚Äù

[2022-09-08T03:17:34] Luis Magalhaes: 35 looks a good price
[2022-09-08T03:18:03] Luis Magalhaes: The low and high beam is on or the other on right?
[2022-09-08T03:24:19] Luis Magalhaes: Cant find them at AliExpress üòÖ do you have a link to them?
[2022-09-08T03:37:19] Artem Bulashev: this one LX18 has LOW / HIGH / BOTH
[2022-09-08T03:38:28] Artem Bulashev: looks like it should be able to do one lamp in place of 2-3 of typical lamps
[2022-09-08T03:41:52] Artem Bulashev: they said - remark ‚ÄúDUAL-WHITE (I can wait 10 days)‚Äùin comemnt to the order https://a.aliexpress.com/_DkaVDwT

[2022-09-08T03:58:52] Luis Magalhaes: I just need some better light for the high beam, the wolf lights are not bad but only have one position üòÖ
[2022-09-08T03:59:31] Luis Magalhaes: With something like this i could even replace my stock light and have high and low beam would be nice

[2022-09-08T17:38:36] rosheee: Not?
[2022-09-08T17:39:23] Artem Bulashev: Doesn‚Äôt matter
[2022-09-08T17:39:37] Artem Bulashev: Between 100v single ubox and other scooter
[2022-09-08T17:42:16] rosheee: Yup
[2022-09-08T17:42:25] rosheee: Then where thermalpaste?
[2022-09-08T17:42:35] rosheee: Inside?
[2022-09-08T17:44:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Well, actually it sits on another copper heatsink before it sits on frame.
[2022-09-08T17:52:15] rosheee: √úhuu
[2022-09-08T17:52:18] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-09-08T17:52:30] rosheee: I use 17wmk thermalpad
[2022-09-08T17:52:43] rosheee: Not even frame mounted or bpttomp√∂ate
[2022-09-08T17:52:55] rosheee: It just sits on bottomplate
[2022-09-08T17:58:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yeah lol, now I know why the heat was storing... üòÇ Zero pasta left, had hoped the pasta on the scooter frame would have been enough for reuse. (Ran out of pasta when installing).
[2022-09-08T18:02:14] Mirono escooters: <animation>
[2022-09-08T18:05:13] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and this is where the thermal pad is going instead of the paste.
[2022-09-08T18:07:57] Mirono escooters: Why?
[2022-09-08T18:08:00] Mirono escooters: No good contact?
[2022-09-08T18:11:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: not regular thermal pad, it is graphite thermal pad.
[2022-09-08T18:11:37] rosheee: Ya
[2022-09-08T18:11:39] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Not sure if it is better or worse than paste.
[2022-09-08T18:11:44] rosheee: Better lol
[2022-09-08T18:11:56] rosheee: Why j not use liquid metal?
[2022-09-08T18:12:03] rosheee: Depends how flat the 2 surfsces are
[2022-09-08T18:15:11] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I wanted to use liquid metal once, still have some lying around but hell nah. Annoying to apply and expensive. Pad can be reused at least.
[2022-09-08T18:16:03] rosheee: Lol
[2022-09-08T18:16:10] rosheee: XD u need like 0.1
[2022-09-08T18:16:15] rosheee: Like nothing
[2022-09-08T18:16:27] Mirono escooters: Anddd if it goes around in frame. Liquid metal flying
[2022-09-08T18:16:33] rosheee: No lol

[2022-09-08T18:25:41] Mirono escooters: Ye
[2022-09-08T18:27:21] Gigolo Joe: Depends on motor, for scooter 5mil, for ebike like qs205 - 10mil
[2022-09-08T19:27:10] S1m 0n: Liquid Metal on Alu frame? U think its realy a good idea?
[2022-09-08T19:29:28] Mirono escooters: Forgot that
[2022-09-08T19:30:37] S1m 0n: So liquid metal for cooling is gallium or not ?
[2022-09-08T19:30:45] S1m 0n: üòÖ
[2022-09-08T20:28:04] Jan: Anybody knows if the Segway GT1 is available in Europe and when?
[2022-09-08T20:53:49] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: nah temps still suck
[2022-09-08T20:54:02] Mirono escooters: ü´°
[2022-09-08T21:02:57] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Went from 28¬∞C to 60¬∞C and man acceleration feels really slow. Maybe graphite pad was not the best idea?
[2022-09-08T21:05:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and man, it's really cold outside and so much fog.
[2022-09-08T21:13:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Well it only pulls 120A, even tho it is set to 135A. Hmmm
[2022-09-08T21:16:15] Jan: Ugh üòÖ when temperature rises faster than speed. Do you have pictures of your cooling solution? I could maybe help there
[2022-09-08T21:17:53] Mirono escooters: Well cooling through epoxy of MOSFETs.. has its limits
[2022-09-08T21:18:09] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Basically it is mounted on another copper heatsink, which is mounted to the scooter frame. In between the Ubox Single and the copper heatsink is a graphite thermal pad and between copper heatsink and scooter frame thermal paste. I have been running this solution with Flipsky 75100 for months now and temps were good, but with Ubox and their copper core it just sucks.
[2022-09-08T21:19:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Like this
[2022-09-08T21:19:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: You see the small holes, that's where the Flipsky MOSFETs were mounted, so I basically reused it.
[2022-09-08T21:20:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: (and made it worse)
[2022-09-08T21:20:55] Jan: Can you draw a picture of it from the side? Like a schematics on where mosfets are and how mounted
[2022-09-08T21:21:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: hmm I can try. One sec.
[2022-09-08T21:22:50] Jan: This was even without thermal paste at the most critical point and it still worked as a concept. Something about your concept or vesc setup may be wrong here
[2022-09-08T21:23:22] Jan: <photos/photo_5845@24-08-2022_20-59-34.jpg>
[2022-09-08T21:23:25] Jan: This layout
[2022-09-08T21:23:47] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yeah but that layout is rather impractical for me
[2022-09-08T21:24:02] Jan: Single vesc back works as well
[2022-09-08T21:24:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and it was good before, it just that the design of the Ubox sucks
[2022-09-08T21:24:59] Jan: @roscheeee You have an Ubox video with good temps?
[2022-09-08T21:25:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: he does not have the ubox single ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2022-09-08T21:30:09] rosheee: Ofc on aluframe The best u can do
[2022-09-08T21:30:36] rosheee: Like fucking without condom with someone who has aids n shit
[2022-09-08T21:32:01] rosheee: Who dis
[2022-09-08T21:32:15] rosheee: Sky is the limit
[2022-09-08T21:32:39] rosheee: Legend
[2022-09-08T21:33:04] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I think the best chance is to get rid of the (case) of the Ubox... red is graphit pad, green is thermal paste. With Flipsky it was the same layout but fairly good temps, unlike the ubox
[2022-09-08T21:34:07] Jan: Mosfet directly on the frame if its 2-3mm thick
[2022-09-08T21:34:45] Jan: You have so much stuff in between that just does nothing except storing heat
[2022-09-08T21:37:27] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yeah that's why I think putting ubox directly on my copper heatsink would be better. The only issue is.. how should I mount it.
[2022-09-08T21:38:52] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Flipsky had much better temps like this.
[2022-09-08T21:38:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <photos/photo_6073@08-09-2022_21-38-53.jpg>

[2022-09-08T21:42:23] Mirono escooters: Yes directly bolted
[2022-09-08T23:04:45] rosheee: What temps xD?
[2022-09-08T23:21:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 150A phase/65A batt, but meh acceleration still slooow
[2022-09-08T23:24:39] rosheee: Lol
[2022-09-08T23:25:03] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and temps are üìà

[2022-09-08T23:25:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but nah Ubox weird
[2022-09-08T23:25:27] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: that's not what 140A phase feels like
[2022-09-08T23:25:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 130A with Flipsky was rocket
[2022-09-08T23:25:57] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and outplayed police
[2022-09-08T23:26:17] Mirono escooters: Weird. maybe bad fw?

[2022-09-08T23:55:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Anyone got pics of the inside of the Ubox Single how they have mounted their MOSFETs? I need to figure something out.
[2022-09-08T23:55:30] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Do the same what I have done with the Flipsky.
[2022-09-09T00:13:16] Mirono escooters: Problably with the resin
[2022-09-09T00:13:40] Mirono escooters: Id open it up and check for bad contact with the thermal pads anyway.. weve seen bad contact

[2022-09-09T12:02:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: üòÖ really after buggin so much to give copper not brassüòÖ
[2022-09-09T12:02:39] Mirono escooters: Brass would've been even worse
[2022-09-09T12:02:50] Mirono escooters: Alu is enough and no problems with corrision
[2022-09-09T12:02:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Surly ,even idea is dumb
[2022-09-09T12:03:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: <animation>
[2022-09-09T12:04:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Sorry had to laugh
[2022-09-09T12:04:54] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2022-09-09T12:06:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I dont understand how they can produce anything while things happen like this and prevorius single was crap also
[2022-09-09T12:08:31] Mirono escooters: Yes me too
[2022-09-09T12:08:39] Mirono escooters: Such good opportunities but always bad execution
[2022-09-09T12:08:49] Artem Bulashev: that becuase of Bat limit I guess is around 30a per controller?
[2022-09-09T12:09:04] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: single motor
[2022-09-09T12:09:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: single esc
[2022-09-09T12:10:04] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and it is not because of bat limit. It's just like that. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I set 150A phase, now 140A.
[2022-09-09T12:11:01] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It is since I am using otega observer.
[2022-09-09T12:13:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but what ever, everything better than BRbRBBRbRBRBr.
[2022-09-09T12:14:15] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But I really want to know what causes duty to report -0,7% when not doing anything
[2022-09-09T12:14:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: that bothers me
[2022-09-09T12:18:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: crazY temp grows faster than speedü§î
[2022-09-09T12:23:14] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yeah, temps almost identical to speed üòÖ It would probably overheat when I start using field weakening or go with 22S (15s right now)...
[2022-09-09T12:26:18] Artem Bulashev: 65a battery single motor
[2022-09-09T12:26:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Total crazY,? Did you ask them and that fill in was the answer?
[2022-09-09T12:26:50] Artem Bulashev: 140a phase
[2022-09-09T12:27:04] Mirono escooters: Thats what happens when u cool through resinüòó
[2022-09-09T12:27:22] Mirono escooters: Not gonna do shit
[2022-09-09T12:27:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Crazy
[2022-09-09T12:27:27] Mirono escooters: Eh spintend weird choices
[2022-09-09T12:27:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Surly not
[2022-09-09T12:27:35] Mirono escooters: Id check contact with pad if i was him
[2022-09-09T12:27:51] Artem Bulashev: I would pot it
[2022-09-09T12:27:57] Artem Bulashev: that should drasically help
[2022-09-09T12:28:01] Mirono escooters: Rip if it dies then
[2022-09-09T12:28:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes üòÇ
[2022-09-09T12:28:14] Mirko Boni: @roscheeee the ROCKSHOX bushings are here!
[2022-09-09T12:28:14] Mirono escooters: Still limited by whatever pcb and resin conductivity is
[2022-09-09T12:28:18] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_6082@09-09-2022_12-28-18.jpg>
[2022-09-09T12:28:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I would stick that shit up in amy's ass deep
[2022-09-09T12:28:32] Mirono escooters: Yea not happy with this design shite
[2022-09-09T12:29:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What do you mean ,i am lost in translation
[2022-09-09T12:29:32] Mirono escooters: Fill with conductivity glue silicon
[2022-09-09T12:29:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Ohh
[2022-09-09T12:30:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well ,if esc would be closed ,you could fill with better stuff
[2022-09-09T12:30:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Non conductive , liquid like trafo oil
[2022-09-09T12:30:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Made for that
[2022-09-09T12:30:56] Artem Bulashev: there is special Heat conductive fill that you can do for controllers
[2022-09-09T12:31:16] Artem Bulashev: it will allow PCB to trasfer heat to the copper and alum case
[2022-09-09T12:31:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Link
[2022-09-09T12:31:36] Mirono escooters: Still far from optimal
[2022-09-09T12:31:42] Artem Bulashev: next 100v single will be made differently - Alumium PCB
[2022-09-09T12:31:49] Artem Bulashev: yeah
[2022-09-09T12:32:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What i say is transfer liquid,made for high v electronics
[2022-09-09T12:32:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: meh now I bought a very expensive paperweight
[2022-09-09T12:32:20] Mirono escooters: Jaj
[2022-09-09T12:32:26] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2022-09-09T12:32:38] Mirono escooters: Risks of preorders
[2022-09-09T12:33:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Modify it , that's only way
[2022-09-09T12:33:16] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yeah I will see what I can do.
[2022-09-09T12:33:17] Artem Bulashev: Well it is rated 100a üôÇ not 150a but I agree it is worse than expected
[2022-09-09T12:33:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Have to check out the inside.
[2022-09-09T12:33:24] Mirono escooters: Still..
[2022-09-09T12:33:31] Mirono escooters: 100a wouldnt work good either
[2022-09-09T12:33:38] Mirono escooters: With his nice cooling solution, should be fine
[2022-09-09T12:33:48] Mirono escooters: Shouldn't need
[2022-09-09T12:33:51] Artem Bulashev: any one tried to shave off resin
[2022-09-09T12:33:52] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2022-09-09T12:34:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: True
[2022-09-09T12:34:04] Artem Bulashev: we did that on PC CPU
[2022-09-09T12:34:06] Mirono escooters: üò±
[2022-09-09T12:34:20] Artem Bulashev: it was very effective
[2022-09-09T12:35:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: This is up to him to open that shit and make what's possible,nonsense like this
[2022-09-09T12:35:28] Artem Bulashev: yeah
[2022-09-09T12:41:15] rosheee: Noiiic3
[2022-09-09T12:42:01] rosheee: Resin?
[2022-09-09T12:42:09] Mirko Boni: What is Noiiic3? I don't know this word!
[2022-09-09T12:42:29] rosheee: Nice
[2022-09-09T12:42:31] Mirono escooters: "nice"
[2022-09-09T12:42:48] rosheee: I took off the black color and that it is
[2022-09-09T12:42:55] rosheee: Idk why it heats up so aggro
[2022-09-09T12:43:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If you open make pictures bro ,the more the better I mean If you make footprint others can follow if its a success and meanwhile maybe we can give ideasü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2022-09-09T12:43:26] Mirko Boni: <video_file>

[2022-09-09T13:13:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Is blue and red ,what i show is same color?
[2022-09-09T13:14:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Or is it one piece?
[2022-09-09T13:29:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: From pics look more yellowish what could mean brass or bronze
[2022-09-09T13:30:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But maybe i see wrong
[2022-09-09T13:31:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: By John kills me
[2022-09-09T13:36:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I regret so much not staying on Flipsky 75100 (not Alu) and 75200 too big I think
[2022-09-09T13:37:47] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and idk if 75200 would require new firmware once again, so even more woork
[2022-09-09T13:43:03] Artem Bulashev: yes one
[2022-09-09T14:58:14] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Hmm shit, means capacitors will block the way when I would try to mount it directly to my heatsink.
[2022-09-09T15:02:56] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6091@09-09-2022_15-02-56.jpg>
[2022-09-09T15:03:02] Artem Bulashev: You can bend them up
[2022-09-09T15:03:40] Artem Bulashev: But there is pcb above, so gues
[2022-09-09T15:09:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Ooh ok
[2022-09-09T15:20:40] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: One thing I have noticed with the otega observer, it will somehow still brrr at the first acceleration after turning VESC back on. ü§®
[2022-09-09T15:52:50] S1m 0n: My Mantis does that too, without vesc. Since I changed the shunt, he makes at first throttle also sometimes brr for a small moment
[2022-09-09T15:54:38] francois schempers: hey guys, my friend for who I worked may want a stronger motor, you guys have any recommendations for the Vesc spintend 75v 100A and on a monorim fork ?
[2022-09-09T15:56:32] Mirono escooters: 1200w blade
[2022-09-09T15:56:56] francois schempers: any link for a good priced one ?

[2022-09-09T18:26:13] Artem Bulashev: 4.3 is abit too much, but again good price and small bezels
[2022-09-09T18:27:59] Mirono escooters: Even. Touch
[2022-09-09T18:28:01] Mirono escooters: Never too much
[2022-09-09T18:28:14] Mirono escooters: Maybe "cheap" vesc display? 3d print housing

[2022-09-09T18:30:07] Artem Bulashev: That‚Äôs my thinking if it has enough power to have at least 2 or 3 FPS it will be great
[2022-09-09T18:39:11] S1m 0n: Touch Screen and rain will not nice, remember ur smartphone ü§£
[2022-09-09T18:49:23] S√©bastien Michon: Hi, anyone have any ideas on how to get the tail light to work on a Xiaomi m365 with vesc flipsky?
[2022-09-09T19:09:40] rosheee: How much V has light
[2022-09-09T19:09:42] rosheee: Use 12V
[2022-09-09T19:10:58] S1m 0n: https://a.aliexpress.com/_mNMGmF6 Add this in front and switch it manuel
[2022-09-09T19:11:24] rosheee: Just put on 12v
[2022-09-09T19:11:34] rosheee: U need daylight anyway
[2022-09-09T19:11:55] Artem Bulashev: True

[2022-09-09T19:12:23] rosheee: Smartphone best
[2022-09-09T19:12:35] rosheee: With touchscreen
[2022-09-09T19:12:48] rosheee: Or the shit i develop
[2022-09-09T19:12:54] rosheee: Got waterproof case now

[2022-09-09T19:13:10] rosheee: Gps n all shit üòò
[2022-09-09T19:13:23] rosheee: Can even play games on it
[2022-09-09T19:13:30] Artem Bulashev: And cost less
[2022-09-09T19:13:39] rosheee: How much the other?
[2022-09-09T19:14:01] Artem Bulashev: Used android 50‚Ç¨

[2022-09-09T19:15:03] rosheee: But 64bit 8gigabyte and u can game on it xD
[2022-09-09T19:15:12] S1m 0n: If it reacts to pressure and is not capacitive, it would work. But the operation is usually bad (remember the first smartphones, how hard you sometimes had to press).
[2022-09-09T19:15:13] rosheee: I do smoll version as well for g30 dash
[2022-09-09T19:15:15] Mirono escooters: Wish i could program, the rest i can for display.. :/

[2022-09-09T23:18:12] Mirko Boni: Wow! I was thinking a size of 40!
[2022-09-09T23:18:29] Mirono escooters: If anyone interested in it.. i habe no project for it.
[2022-09-09T23:18:35] Mirono escooters: Opened to check condition and ff it
[2022-09-09T23:18:46] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_6105@09-09-2022_23-18-46.jpg>
[2022-09-09T23:20:23] Federico77: 35 It can't be 1000w real
[2022-09-09T23:21:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yah it‚Äôs the peak
[2022-09-09T23:21:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: Rated is 500w
[2022-09-09T23:21:19] Mirono escooters: Aha
[2022-09-09T23:21:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: This brand made 40mm too
[2022-09-09T23:21:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is the cheapest motor brand, that made laotie etc or similar motor
[2022-09-09T23:21:52] Mirono escooters: Good to note
[2022-09-09T23:23:08] Mirono escooters: 64A hall?
[2022-09-09T23:26:54] Mirono escooters: Eh halls work, good to trst always
[2022-09-09T23:27:02] Mirono escooters: Quality is nice even if its cheap

[2022-09-10T00:00:20] rosheee: now g30 smoll
[2022-09-10T00:00:21] Mirono escooters: With enough mods it iNt
[2022-09-10T00:00:29] rosheee: ja the 15S was nice
[2022-09-10T00:01:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yah can 110kmh then super suce
[2022-09-10T00:02:46] rosheee: I hope new motors can go more than 117
[2022-09-10T00:02:49] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-09-10T00:04:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: If TRONIC don‚Äôt catch fire maybe yes
[2022-09-10T00:05:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: Xd 117kmh with monorim
[2022-09-10T00:05:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: Suicide
[2022-09-10T00:05:09] rosheee: lol
[2022-09-10T00:05:13] rosheee: now rion CEO said
[2022-09-10T00:05:16] rosheee: he sends 2x 250
[2022-09-10T00:05:18] Mirono escooters: Nah never
[2022-09-10T00:05:18] rosheee: and 250R
[2022-09-10T00:05:53] rosheee: i told him he just should send what he told i dont need 2 250 i need warranty replacement and not even the 250r's he wanna gift
[2022-09-10T00:06:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: U paid with PayPal?
[2022-09-10T00:06:12] rosheee: lol
[2022-09-10T00:06:17] rosheee: doesn't matter
[2022-09-10T00:06:21] rosheee: even if he sends nothing
[2022-09-10T00:06:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes or not?
[2022-09-10T00:06:26] rosheee: NO
[2022-09-10T00:06:28] rosheee: xD
[2022-09-10T00:06:31] rosheee: and it is months ago
[2022-09-10T00:06:34] rosheee: IF
[2022-09-10T00:06:35] rosheee: he never sends
[2022-09-10T00:06:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: No good
[2022-09-10T00:06:37] rosheee: i fly to usa
[2022-09-10T00:06:46] rosheee: i have evidence and post online
[2022-09-10T00:06:50] rosheee: and i fly over
[2022-09-10T00:06:54] rosheee: believe me
[2022-09-10T00:07:03] rosheee: and pay him visit
[2022-09-10T00:07:05] rosheee: also NORDBOT
[2022-09-10T00:07:09] rosheee: then he can show me his guns
[2022-09-10T00:08:43] rosheee: <photos/photo_6108@10-09-2022_00-08-43.jpg>

[2022-09-10T00:09:41] rosheee: funny thing is
[2022-09-10T00:10:14] rosheee: i film it then üòÜcuz like nordbot they don't believe that a fucker gets to USA just for this
[2022-09-10T01:19:52] rosheee: Best
[2022-09-10T01:20:13] rosheee: <video_file>
[2022-09-10T01:25:57] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: ye, very useful on 100+ km/h
[2022-09-10T01:26:07] rosheee: i need it
[2022-09-10T01:26:15] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: who are you trying to fool
[2022-09-10T01:26:16] rosheee: last few days i needed it couple times
[2022-09-10T01:26:18] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: ahahah
[2022-09-10T01:26:18] rosheee: NO RLY
[2022-09-10T01:26:24] rosheee: i had to ge tof scooter
[2022-09-10T01:26:29] rosheee: and say sry i have no bell
[2022-09-10T01:27:02] rosheee: i hate it without bell
[2022-09-10T01:27:04] rosheee: was worst
[2022-09-10T01:27:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Someone else with the Single 100v 100A with a different cooling solution (g30 with deck) tried it as well and it performs exactly the same, so it is a limitation of the ESC design, not with my solution.
[2022-09-10T01:27:17] rosheee: no lol
[2022-09-10T01:27:18] rosheee: xD
[2022-09-10T01:27:43] rosheee: no limitation
[2022-09-10T01:27:57] rosheee: idk why u get that heat
[2022-09-10T01:28:14] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: it did, didn't he sent video?
[2022-09-10T01:28:25] rosheee: maybe u failed
[2022-09-10T01:28:33] rosheee: i buy now ubox 100v from @TurboSasch
[2022-09-10T01:28:35] rosheee: if he gives me
[2022-09-10T01:28:40] rosheee: then test
[2022-09-10T01:28:50] rosheee: 78
[2022-09-10T01:35:25] rosheee: then test
[2022-09-10T01:35:29] rosheee: with 20S and 16s
[2022-09-10T01:36:10] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: How am I supposed to fail? @TurboSasch his ESC gets already to 48¬∞C with only 60-80A phase and ~1,5kW. Now imagine he would have to brake and accelerate again without letting it cool. It will get even worse. I have used it now on longer trips and it heated up more and more.
[2022-09-10T01:36:44] rosheee: 2.5kw
[2022-09-10T01:36:52] rosheee: i test it
[2022-09-10T01:38:29] rosheee: u mounted the ubox on frame?
[2022-09-10T01:38:31] rosheee: or bottomplate?
[2022-09-10T01:41:24] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I have no bottom plate, it is on frame.
[2022-09-10T01:41:29] rosheee: ja lol ^^'
[2022-09-10T01:41:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But frame is good enough, was for my Flipsky 75100 very good.
[2022-09-10T01:41:36] rosheee: hast du angeschliffen?
[2022-09-10T01:41:41] rosheee: ok
[2022-09-10T01:41:57] rosheee: u mounted same like flipsky?
[2022-09-10T01:42:06] rosheee: or with the crap thermalbear shizz√∂?
[2022-09-10T01:42:12] rosheee: i upload now 300A 5.3fw
[2022-09-10T01:42:14] rosheee: and go retard
[2022-09-10T01:43:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, it is basically mounted the same way, but Flipsky MOSFETs were directly mounted to my heatsink, while the Ubox still sits inside the case.
[2022-09-10T01:44:50] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: You mean the thermal pad? Yes, it is still there. I could try again with paste instead, maybe that would help. (Or make it worse who knows).
[2022-09-10T01:46:31] rosheee: maybe it isnt flat ^^
[2022-09-10T01:46:40] rosheee: but the pad is lol ^^'
[2022-09-10T01:46:41] rosheee: shiz
[2022-09-10T01:47:08] rosheee: use alphacool 0.5mm 14 or 17
[2022-09-10T01:47:13] rosheee: w/mK
[2022-09-10T02:11:54] Artem Bulashev: Spintend said that they made it same as other Ubox BUT
[2022-09-10T02:12:04] rosheee: ?
[2022-09-10T02:13:57] Artem Bulashev: Aperantly fets in 75200 dual were very good at heat dissipation through the top resin, those fets in 100v single are not so great at it - they didn‚Äôt expect to see such difference from model to model in terms of how well it is able to dissipate through resin (I also would think it is about same between all fets of that design, guess it is not)
[2022-09-10T02:14:23] rosheee: idk why ppl buy 100V
[2022-09-10T02:14:44] Artem Bulashev: 18-22s set ups
[2022-09-10T02:14:52] rosheee: where?
[2022-09-10T02:14:59] Artem Bulashev: Intention should be
[2022-09-10T02:15:03] Artem Bulashev: But honestly
[2022-09-10T02:15:12] Artem Bulashev: Properly cooled it should be win win
[2022-09-10T02:15:14] rosheee: yes
[2022-09-10T02:15:23] rosheee: i bought now ubox from @TurboSasch
[2022-09-10T02:15:28] rosheee: i test it with 20S and 16S
[2022-09-10T02:15:31] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2022-09-10T02:15:37] rosheee: mounted to 5mm bottomplate ^^
[2022-09-10T02:15:43] rosheee: this time with screws üòÜ
[2022-09-10T02:15:59] rosheee: not just "hope it touches the bottomplate"
[2022-09-10T02:16:04] Artem Bulashev: I believe there is only one way to solve heat issue on it well
[2022-09-10T02:16:10] Artem Bulashev: Pot it
[2022-09-10T02:16:32] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6110@10-09-2022_02-16-32.jpg>
[2022-09-10T02:17:03] Artem Bulashev: In between here. So that pcb is cooled down via copper, not only resin of fets
[2022-09-10T02:17:17] Artem Bulashev: That should reduce heat well
[2022-09-10T02:17:39] rosheee: i will open and checl
[2022-09-10T02:17:41] rosheee: check
[2022-09-10T02:18:26] rosheee: but solder job def. much better than tronic xD
[2022-09-10T02:18:36] Artem Bulashev: Also add thermal paste her, so that heat is transferred from copper to aluminum case and than scooter.
[2022-09-10T02:18:53] rosheee: i mount without case
[2022-09-10T02:18:59] Artem Bulashev: Amount of ‚Äúdesigning effort‚Äù is really impressive
[2022-09-10T02:19:24] Artem Bulashev: Still wrong cooling but Damm impressive amount of mounting solutions and over all design for 119$
[2022-09-10T02:21:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: Copper only I think cost around 10$, not cheap for production
[2022-09-10T02:21:22] rosheee: 0.5$
[2022-09-10T02:23:59] Artem Bulashev: Yeah copper block cost in this ubox is same as entire casing and mounting they told me
[2022-09-10T02:25:41] Artem Bulashev: It is definitely an experience- specially when they first bought brass and CNCed it for full batch ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÅ
[2022-09-10T02:25:58] Artem Bulashev: Brass would be terrible on this
[2022-09-10T02:26:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Worse than aluminium xd
[2022-09-10T02:26:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yeah I know China don‚Äôt have good
[2022-09-10T02:26:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: But they have even a browserüòÇüòÇ
[2022-09-10T02:26:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: Just type ‚Äúbrass thermal conduction‚Äù
[2022-09-10T02:29:15] Jan: Google is blocked there
[2022-09-10T02:29:24] Jan: Only chinesium search engines
[2022-09-10T02:29:42] rosheee: "stone best thermal compound"
[2022-09-10T02:31:15] rosheee: so i gonna do fuckeria now
[2022-09-10T02:31:25] rosheee: 300A phase max 300A current max 90A battery max ubox 75V v1
[2022-09-10T02:31:31] rosheee: <animation>
[2022-09-10T02:31:34] rosheee: let's see
[2022-09-10T02:32:11] rosheee: If police or baguettez
[2022-09-10T02:35:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: No with vpn
[2022-09-10T02:52:11] rosheee: 60A bms no fuckeria xD
[2022-09-10T03:03:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It gets better, still sticking like glue to the ground, but in a good way. Will try again later when ground is not wet anymore.
[2022-09-10T03:04:28] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Maybe I can try 21S tomorrow if my friends let me use his batt, before I regret building my batt for 22S. üòÖ
[2022-09-10T03:04:46] rosheee: TAKE THAT BRAKE CURRENT AWAY
[2022-09-10T03:04:46] rosheee: xdD
[2022-09-10T03:04:53] rosheee: u set -1 and rbake off?
[2022-09-10T03:05:55] rosheee: allow breaking
[2022-09-10T03:07:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: xdd yes it is off, but it seems set-brake current will ignore it
[2022-09-10T03:07:27] rosheee: make 0
[2022-09-10T03:07:33] rosheee: and the battery shit also
[2022-09-10T03:11:14] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: well 4p of vtc6a but 14awg... was not very happy about it either (bought it), but now at least it works after I had to swap the BMS.
[2022-09-10T03:14:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Why you choose vtc6a cells?
[2022-09-10T03:16:10] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I did not choose them, I bought the batt. First and last time I done that üòÖ
[2022-09-10T03:16:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Well ok, he offered me to use VTC6A instead of what I told him Molicel P42A (which I use).
[2022-09-10T03:17:14] rosheee: Where battery?
[2022-09-10T03:17:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: what
[2022-09-10T03:17:28] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: in my scoot
[2022-09-10T03:17:31] rosheee: 22S?
[2022-09-10T03:17:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: noo
[2022-09-10T03:17:40] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: this is 15s
[2022-09-10T03:17:58] rosheee: @PaoloWu 15S 100kmh
[2022-09-10T03:18:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 22s will be a combination of 15s4p (vtc6a) + 7s5p (molicel p42a)
[2022-09-10T03:18:38] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: cannot fit 22s into pro frame
[2022-09-10T03:18:46] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and don't want to tbh
[2022-09-10T03:18:47] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: üòÖ
[2022-09-10T03:20:40] rosheee: Sad
[2022-09-10T03:20:51] rosheee: what u gonna build?
[2022-09-10T03:21:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: what
[2022-09-10T03:22:00] rosheee: battery
[2022-09-10T03:22:04] rosheee: u talked about 22S
[2022-09-10T03:22:09] rosheee: switch to g30?
[2022-09-10T03:22:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: no, will stay on pro for now. But going to do this ^
[2022-09-10T03:22:45] rosheee: @PaoloWu can i use this switch as well for powerup kelly?
[2022-09-10T03:22:53] rosheee: ok
[2022-09-10T03:23:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: would love to switch to g30 tho, but still hoping for even better frame being released in Germany.
[2022-09-10T03:23:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but nah nothing here
[2022-09-10T03:23:41] rosheee: p65
[2022-09-10T03:24:08] rosheee: ?
[2022-09-10T03:24:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: was hoping for p100 but I don't think they will modify it for Germany.
[2022-09-10T03:25:04] rosheee: i wrote segway 10x never replied
[2022-09-10T03:25:06] rosheee: these fuckers

[2022-09-10T12:47:29] Mirono escooters: My finger confirmed its that chipüòÜ
[2022-09-10T12:47:39] Mirono escooters: Its right at 5v output
[2022-09-10T12:47:48] Mirono escooters: Can i Remove it and give it artificial 5v?
[2022-09-10T12:47:49] Mirono escooters: Problably
[2022-09-10T12:49:16] Konstantin: Macro lens for the Seek Thermal Pro https://multi-com.eu/,details,id_pr,22722,key,macro-lens-for-the-seek-thermal-pro.html
[2022-09-10T12:49:22] Konstantin: Something like this
[2022-09-10T12:49:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: vp232 = can transceiver. if you didn't use can bus, it would be weird if dead
[2022-09-10T12:50:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: any burn trace ?
[2022-09-10T12:51:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: are 5v and 3.3v present ?
[2022-09-10T12:51:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: (multimeter check)
[2022-09-10T12:51:45] Mirono escooters: 5v ded
[2022-09-10T12:51:54] Mirono escooters: Wait what
[2022-09-10T12:51:58] Mirono escooters: üòÜüò±
[2022-09-10T12:52:06] Mirono escooters: The only thing that happend is shorted halls
[2022-09-10T12:52:14] Mirono escooters: All cables went grrr
[2022-09-10T12:52:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: then 5v regulator is dead.
[2022-09-10T12:53:01] Mirono escooters: I can replace it
[2022-09-10T12:53:45] Mirono escooters: Aight noobie mistake i desoldered it while still connected to power. Good i didnt short shit. Lets see thermal cam now
[2022-09-10T12:55:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ü§Øü§Ø
[2022-09-10T12:55:51] Mirono escooters: I need more coffee
[2022-09-10T12:55:56] Mirono escooters: Short stikk present. 8w of heat

[2022-09-10T12:57:00] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_6119@10-09-2022_12-57-00.jpg>
[2022-09-10T12:57:18] Mirono escooters: I recognize it from xiaomi. Isnt it 3.3v?
[2022-09-10T12:57:19] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if the stm heat so much, good chance he's dead
[2022-09-10T12:57:26] Mirono escooters: No its under stm
[2022-09-10T12:57:32] Mirono escooters: Its the 5 pin chip
[2022-09-10T12:57:43] Mirono escooters: The picture is shifted, i need to calibrate it
[2022-09-10T12:58:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 5 pins... good chance it's a regulator
[2022-09-10T12:58:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what's the marking on it ?
[2022-09-10T12:58:33] Mirono escooters: Recognize it from xiaomi
[2022-09-10T12:58:46] Mirono escooters: L033
[2022-09-10T13:00:08] Mirono escooters: Ill get kapton and my Xiaomi chips and hope its the same lol
[2022-09-10T13:00:34] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_6120@10-09-2022_13-00-34.jpg>
[2022-09-10T13:03:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if it's written l033 on xiaomi too, yes. if not, don't try.
[2022-09-10T13:04:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: (xiaomi often use tps regulator if i remember)
[2022-09-10T13:05:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but if the regulator is dead, good chance something else powered from it is dead too...
[2022-09-10T13:13:48] Mirono escooters: F
[2022-09-10T13:14:22] Mirono escooters: I rather try, 1: saves money 2: less waste 3: i train my microsolderi scills
[2022-09-10T13:16:59] Mirono escooters: Its ... Working.. but still 8w and a very hot chip
[2022-09-10T13:17:07] Mirono escooters: Something else is draining the poor chip
[2022-09-10T13:27:36] Mirono escooters: Okay stm problably fucked. Onto next
[2022-09-10T13:27:55] Mirono escooters: How i st link a spintend single? I fail to find anything
[2022-09-10T13:28:17] Mirono escooters: It actually powers on but stm does go to 50* so guess its just stressing poor 3.3v chip
[2022-09-10T14:14:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i already had partially dead/damages stm32. adc was dead but some things still worked üòÖ
[2022-09-10T14:19:59] Mirono escooters: Guess that's this
[2022-09-10T15:17:32] Artem Bulashev: On higher frequency pwm we loose some of the low end torque?
[2022-09-10T15:18:00] Ofek üê•: Change MSX settings so the image tracing match the thermal
[2022-09-10T15:19:37] Artem Bulashev: Any one ever considered to take QS-S4 display and reprogram it to work on Vesc UART ?
[2022-09-10T15:27:43] Mirono escooters: Where?
[2022-09-10T15:29:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it would be a crazy work. need to do retro-enginering of the pcb and segment display, check if the mcu is not locked/encrypted (preventing refleshing like some display i know), and program this shitty renesas mcu üòÖ
[2022-09-10T15:31:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: also, there is a lot of issue with really high current and uart. it's gets too easily noisy. needs at least shield cable... and it's not even enought sometime. uart show serious limits.
[2022-09-10T15:33:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: we observed spikes at 12v arriving on the uart line of the mcu with high current phases (200-300A)
[2022-09-10T15:33:53] S1m 0n: https://github.com/teixeluis/escooter-lcd-esc-decode QS-S4 Inside there are also 4 test points which are directly connected to the MCU (At least that's the case with the Vsett display and Kaabo LT01.)
[2022-09-10T15:35:37] Artem Bulashev: It is not 12v
[2022-09-10T15:35:44] Artem Bulashev: It‚Äôs vbat powered
[2022-09-10T15:35:48] Artem Bulashev: Low current
[2022-09-10T15:36:08] Artem Bulashev: That‚Äôs how all standard displays are wires and they seem to work
[2022-09-10T15:36:57] Artem Bulashev: CPU likely locked, but considering amount of fake qs-s4 there should be fw some where
[2022-09-10T15:37:14] Artem Bulashev: Chip May need to be replaced by unlocked one yeah
[2022-09-10T15:37:45] S1m 0n: Who can this better do than koxx3 or Netzpfuscher üòÅ
[2022-09-10T15:38:36] Artem Bulashev: I was thinking that producers of qs-s4 could do required changes to the FW under a bit of guidance
[2022-09-10T15:39:45] Ofek üê•: On my camera it's located where the two boxes
[2022-09-10T15:41:10] S1m 0n: That would be ingenious
[2022-09-10T15:41:57] S1m 0n: <photos/photo_6122@10-09-2022_15-41-57.jpg>
[2022-09-10T15:47:06] Mirono escooters: Damn you, flir. I already adjusted to max still 1cm off
[2022-09-10T15:47:07] Mirono escooters: Bs
[2022-09-10T15:47:29] Artem Bulashev: They would only need to re work messages to correspond and read few things - speed - brake used - would be awesome if eeprom could to save current settings as mode 2 while mode 1 would be over writing settings with additional speed limit and power limit (mode two would save only those 2 parameters to restore them when selected)
[2022-09-10T15:48:07] Artem Bulashev: We don‚Äôt really need display for anything beside keeping OEM look and seeing current speed + battery level (which is done independently but on board voltage reader)
[2022-09-10T15:48:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no, no, uart lines must be 3.3v or 5v on display side (5v for qss4/eye)... and we see spikes at 12v. of courses there is vbat arriving, but it's not an issue
[2022-09-10T15:48:57] Artem Bulashev: Uart logic yes.
[2022-09-10T15:49:10] Artem Bulashev: What I mean is that uart doesn‚Äôt run along 3amp 12v, it runs next to 60v 0.3a So not sure where and why it would get spikes
[2022-09-10T15:51:20] Artem Bulashev: You mean inside display 5v regulator has spikes to 12v on occasion ? (That seems hardly possible, that would burn out displays own mcu thang
[2022-09-10T15:52:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no, the spkies were on uart rx
[2022-09-10T15:52:19] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2022-09-10T15:53:14] Artem Bulashev: How does display survive that üòÑ
[2022-09-10T15:54:54] S1m 0n: they are resistant. I fiddled a lot with my rum and even if a lot broke, the display is still alive
[2022-09-10T15:56:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no idea. i started to analyze the pcb, but i didn't had time to finish
[2022-09-10T16:30:53] Artem Bulashev: Surprisingly considering cheap shit that it is
[2022-09-10T17:54:38] S1m 0n: probably because it is not custom made it has a lot of buffers
[2022-09-10T17:55:03] S1m 0n: made for a wide audience
[2022-09-10T19:49:56] Artem Bulashev: Hard to say, but sounds like it could be grate option potentially
[2022-09-10T20:03:27] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Just have done my first "fast" ride with the Ubox Single 100v with some friends on their moped, still enough to over take their sport mopeds but man somehow I am slower than Flipsky even tho I push more power and casually hitting 83¬∞C üò¨
[2022-09-10T20:04:47] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @artBula Ok, so when I open it and take off the heatsink, I should do what? Fill in-between the MOSFETs with paste? Or is there something specific I have to use?
[2022-09-10T20:11:55] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_6123@10-09-2022_20-11-55.jpg>
[2022-09-10T20:11:56] Mirko Boni: Good evening everyone, can you help me? Do the data that I have marked with the red marker refer to a single engine? or do I have to double the value because it refers to two motors?
[2022-09-10T20:13:14] Mirko Boni: I can't connect the vesc tool yet because I haven't installed the battery yet!
[2022-09-10T20:13:35] Mirko Boni: So I started studying!
[2022-09-10T20:26:32] sombre_enfant: One tab one esc
[2022-09-10T20:26:45] sombre_enfant: Then you go to can and go to esc B
[2022-09-10T20:34:46] Mirko Boni: Thanks Sombre now I understand! So if I create new profiles then can I modify them with new different data?
[2022-09-10T20:34:52] rosheee: YAS
[2022-09-10T20:34:58] rosheee: omg i pushed daly bms 2 hard
[2022-09-10T20:35:01] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-09-10T20:35:31] Mirko Boni: For example, if I create legal and full power profiles, can I adjust them differently for each profile?
[2022-09-10T20:35:37] rosheee: yes
[2022-09-10T20:35:42] rosheee: like when u make sauce
[2022-09-10T20:35:46] rosheee: u can adjust the sauce
[2022-09-10T20:35:47] Mirko Boni: Perfect!
[2022-09-10T20:36:07] rosheee: and best is
[2022-09-10T20:36:15] rosheee: police don't know how the sauce(profile) is setted up
[2022-09-10T20:36:20] rosheee: cuz they can't see
[2022-09-10T20:36:40] Mirko Boni: Fantastic üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2022-09-10T20:37:02] Mirko Boni: Did you put 500w and 20 km / h?
[2022-09-10T20:37:09] rosheee: i put
[2022-09-10T20:37:12] rosheee: that it is police comfy

[2022-09-10T20:39:23] Mirko Boni: @roscheeee can you sell shaped monorim pieces for my G30?
[2022-09-10T20:40:47] Jan: Oh the misery of bending them. I would never do that again lol üòÇ
[2022-09-10T20:40:57] Jan: The work is just painful
[2022-09-10T20:41:10] Mirko Boni: Why jan?
[2022-09-10T20:41:25] Jan: But maybe i do already bent new monorim from scratch. New design already for 10x3 tires
[2022-09-10T20:41:32] Jan: Its hand bent
[2022-09-10T20:41:32] Mirko Boni: Is it complicated to do the folding?
[2022-09-10T20:41:40] Jan: Takes 2hours to bend one
[2022-09-10T20:42:00] Mirko Boni: Wow! I did not imagine!
[2022-09-10T20:42:14] rosheee: LOL

[2022-09-10T20:42:16] rosheee: bullshit
[2022-09-10T20:42:18] rosheee: 5min
[2022-09-10T20:42:28] rosheee: when u can concentrate
[2022-09-10T20:42:33] rosheee: and nobody asks dumb questions
[2022-09-10T20:42:38] Jan: üòÇüòÇ
[2022-09-10T20:42:45] rosheee: XD not u
[2022-09-10T20:42:52] rosheee: but last time i had 5min on the left side
[2022-09-10T20:42:53] rosheee: then
[2022-09-10T20:42:55] Mirko Boni: I do not understand! üò≠üò≠üò≠
[2022-09-10T20:43:02] rosheee: 15min on 2nd one
[2022-09-10T20:43:23] Mirko Boni: But do you have any to sell?
[2022-09-10T20:44:20] Gigolo Joe: Yes @Calip3r did it

[2022-09-11T01:07:23] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/tree/master/lispBM#native-libraries Yes, it is possible. I think I look into it when I have the time.
[2022-09-11T13:28:46] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahahah ... C code calling lips calling C code üôà
[2022-09-11T13:46:07] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Still wondering why they not have gone with c code anyway instead of Lisp when they even allow to use native libs. ü§®
[2022-09-11T13:50:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i guess it's for compatibility, even when vesc builders doesn't provide h files for their hardware. but yeah, it think it's messy at the end.

[2022-09-11T15:34:51] Ofek üê•: Nice find! The best part is that we can write Arduino code for Pi Pico, interesting to get it working with this display
[2022-09-11T16:21:10] S1m 0n: why n pi pico? there is a Pi with all the necessary interfaces in the display
[2022-09-11T16:33:10] Artem Bulashev: Yeah it is Not Just display
[2022-09-11T16:33:58] Artem Bulashev: It is Pi on the back - Cortex m0+
[2022-09-11T16:34:26] Artem Bulashev: It also has gyro built in. So we can use it to make alarm code
[2022-09-11T16:35:04] Artem Bulashev: And there is GPIO so in case of VSETT display we can use RFID, which communicates over Uart!
[2022-09-11T16:35:41] Artem Bulashev: Just an idea on top of simple read out of Vesc parameters
[2022-09-11T16:36:11] Artem Bulashev: In theory we could even rub usb cable from vesc to display üòÑ

[2022-09-12T19:48:29] rosheee: Ortega that it works
[2022-09-12T19:48:32] rosheee: Be discussed here
[2022-09-12T19:48:51] rosheee: Is v6.0 better than 5.3,
[2022-09-12T19:49:29] Nome: in my case v6.0 MXLEMMING works better at low rpm instead ortega at high rpm
[2022-09-12T19:50:21] rosheee: Depends on motor
[2022-09-12T19:51:41] Nome: with ortega i do a little more erpm, but mxlemming is more fluid and maybe it has more torque, i have to log to better evaluate
[2022-09-12T21:57:31] rosheee: what motor'
[2022-09-12T21:57:50] rosheee: @kawaiinekololis can't use motor with mxlemming
[2022-09-12T22:03:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: On ubox, yes. On Flipsky was no problem. But from my experience now with both, I can confirm otega is less smooth and maybe you're right with the torque as well.

[2022-09-15T19:53:56] rosheee: then also take scooters with me
[2022-09-15T19:53:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: Who cares, it's fun to go full speed
[2022-09-15T19:54:01] rosheee: but no space in my car üòÜ
[2022-09-15T19:54:06] rosheee: i reach fullspeed so fast
[2022-09-15T19:54:16] rosheee: fucking rion + vsett 10+ motor only 117
[2022-09-15T19:54:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ah... yes. always originals for official papers
[2022-09-15T19:54:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yah but who knows EU to EU country has dogane

[2022-09-15T19:55:43] rosheee: then maybe 118 XD
[2022-09-15T19:55:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: üòÇ
[2022-09-15T19:56:05] rosheee: ALSO Adam had topspeed 117
[2022-09-15T19:56:06] rosheee: 73mph

[2022-09-15T19:59:58] rosheee: rear 20S6P molicel front 20s7p m50lt
[2022-09-15T20:37:56] Luis Magalhaes: Why not the two in parallel
[2022-09-15T20:39:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: Parallel isn‚Äôt series
[2022-09-15T20:39:14] rosheee: I know
[2022-09-15T20:39:21] rosheee: Me brain
[2022-09-15T20:39:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: And even you need connect in parallel
[2022-09-15T20:39:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you don‚Äôt , your esc will catch fire
[2022-09-15T20:39:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: Gnd always common in dual configuration
[2022-09-15T20:40:04] rosheee: <voice_message>
[2022-09-15T20:40:07] Mirono escooters: Series must be fun
[2022-09-15T20:40:40] rosheee: <voice_message>
[2022-09-15T20:58:42] Luis Magalhaes: I would put the two in parallel üòÇ
[2022-09-15T22:12:48] Artem Bulashev: Oh shit
[2022-09-15T22:20:51] Artem Bulashev: Only?? It is low kv motor man üòÅüòÅüòÅ well not so low for 72v battery but you get what physics tell us :) What did you expect to get from VSETT 10+ motor that goes 72kmh on 60v ? 1s gives about 3-6kmh gain. So on 20s you should only get 98kmh AT MOST - likely 88kmh at most
[2022-09-15T22:21:17] Jan: Its 93kph
[2022-09-15T22:21:52] Jan: Torque is nice but wheelspin up to 80kph
[2022-09-15T22:22:00] Artem Bulashev: To cross ANY eu broader you are obliged to have passport or will be fined. To cross Swiss - Eu boarder have to have passport because Switzerland is not in EU
[2022-09-15T22:22:59] Artem Bulashev: So in my guesstimation. Better gain than I would expect in real life. Need higher KV motor if you want to go faster
[2022-09-15T22:23:29] Mirono escooters: Half not true
[2022-09-15T22:23:39] Mirono escooters: Belgium to sweden Passport not obligated, but recommenddd
[2022-09-15T22:23:43] Mirono escooters: I dont know English name
[2022-09-15T22:23:46] Mirono escooters: Its a agreement
[2022-09-15T22:24:26] Artem Bulashev: Yeah because batteries will start to try to equalize through interconnecting wires like can and power button üòÇ
[2022-09-15T22:24:41] Jan: Which 10inch hub? Hubmotor-Master @PaoloWu probably knows
[2022-09-15T22:24:48] Artem Bulashev: You need at least your Residence ID card, same as passport because it is your identification document
[2022-09-15T22:25:57] Artem Bulashev: I got fined once for crossing slovakia - Austrian boarder without ID card.
[2022-09-15T22:26:01] Jan: I mean 16kW continuous should be handle more than 117kph with the right motor on G30
[2022-09-15T22:26:11] Artem Bulashev: No
[2022-09-15T22:26:19] Artem Bulashev: Kw is irrelevant to speed
[2022-09-15T22:26:32] Artem Bulashev: It only will get it closer to free spin speed
[2022-09-15T22:26:34] Jan: Air drag <= ?
[2022-09-15T22:26:52] Jan: 120kph+ air drag is quite relevant
[2022-09-15T22:26:59] Artem Bulashev: G30 motor on 20s will have higher air speed
[2022-09-15T22:27:07] Artem Bulashev: Because it is made for 13s
[2022-09-15T22:27:13] Artem Bulashev: So it has higher KV
[2022-09-15T22:27:17] Artem Bulashev: There is no magic
[2022-09-15T22:28:09] Artem Bulashev: You can increase Kv by removing one spin around each tooth üòÅ
[2022-09-15T22:28:15] Jan: <animation>
[2022-09-15T22:28:23] rosheee: 16S 80kmh something
[2022-09-15T22:28:40] rosheee: 117kmh
[2022-09-15T22:28:49] rosheee: Adam also has 73mph
[2022-09-15T22:29:07] rosheee: 16S over 100kmh
[2022-09-15T22:30:06] Artem Bulashev: Adam has 20s
[2022-09-15T22:30:22] Artem Bulashev: I designed his battery
[2022-09-15T22:30:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: What
[2022-09-15T22:31:05] Jan: Need more HIgh speed 10in hub than Vsett10+
[2022-09-15T22:31:14] Jan: What exists?
[2022-09-15T22:33:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: I send already 2 prototypes to rosche
[2022-09-15T22:34:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ask him about tests
[2022-09-15T22:36:59] Jan: Ah i remember
[2022-09-15T22:38:10] rosheee: XD
[2022-09-15T22:38:25] rosheee: I unpacked today
[2022-09-15T22:38:41] rosheee: Didnt even looked at motors rly and rest
[2022-09-15T22:39:15] rosheee: He said 73mph top speed
[2022-09-15T22:39:36] rosheee: Something cut when I reach 117kmh
[2022-09-15T22:40:13] S1m 0n: Too fast to generate the magnetic field ü§£
[2022-09-15T22:40:27] rosheee: 117kmh to slow
[2022-09-15T22:41:04] S1m 0n: Is there already a world record for tip speed on an eScooter?
[2022-09-15T22:41:09] S1m 0n: üòÅ
[2022-09-15T22:41:11] rosheee: 3x2 pmts to test
[2022-09-15T22:41:39] rosheee: After g30 20S finished we write them
[2022-09-15T22:42:18] rosheee: If @PaoloWu motors more fuckeria then we use them
[2022-09-15T22:43:13] rosheee: @PaoloWu need again 3x2 10x3 pmt n3xt month

[2022-09-15T23:25:02] rosheee: we need
[2022-09-15T23:25:03] Jan: Do you need some special material for the housing?
[2022-09-15T23:25:17] Jan: Never thought about making a custom one but maybe consider
[2022-09-15T23:25:18] rosheee: i give 1 vsett motor to @Star_Delta_Master
[2022-09-15T23:25:25] rosheee: then he tries delta mod on it
[2022-09-15T23:25:32] rosheee: then 160kmh and more possible
[2022-09-15T23:27:35] Jan: Stator stack in sheets to reduce eddie currents?
[2022-09-15T23:32:15] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-09-15T23:34:47] Jan: ok two upgrades i would made. Correct me if im wrong here but the main issues with todays modern motors are: Eddie Currents and Copper Wire temperature ? So: - Amorphous Metal Sheet as a Stator Stack - Hollow enameled copper wires with coolant in it Would be a custom motor, more efficient, runs with higher power density
[2022-09-15T23:35:07] Mirono escooters: Enameled copper, hollow?
[2022-09-15T23:35:38] Mirono escooters: Ur loosing awg of the copper wire, and how would yo cool it.? Even make that? üò±
[2022-09-15T23:35:53] Jan: it somehow exists according to wiki
[2022-09-15T23:36:08] Jan: Channel could be super tiny
[2022-09-15T23:40:40] Mirono escooters: üò±
[2022-09-15T23:40:43] Mirono escooters: Thats sick
[2022-09-15T23:42:48] Jan: Amorphous Metals will generate a lot less eddie currents therefore higher efficiency. Also cooled copper wires would take a lot more load
[2022-09-15T23:43:07] Jan: They are fatter for sure but not by a lot since surface is quadradic to radius ^^
[2022-09-15T23:43:14] Mirono escooters: Guess both is ‚Ç¨ related
[2022-09-15T23:43:19] Jan: But will need less windings for higher speed anyway
[2022-09-15T23:43:22] Jan: Yes
[2022-09-15T23:43:24] Jan: Fuck ‚Ç¨
[2022-09-15T23:43:30] Jan: If you want WR
[2022-09-15T23:43:38] Jan: Costs is secondary
[2022-09-15T23:43:52] Mirono escooters: Yea, my wallet doesnt like it
[2022-09-15T23:43:53] Mirono escooters: :)
[2022-09-15T23:44:02] Jan: Same lol
[2022-09-15T23:44:06] Jan: Need own company
[2022-09-15T23:44:23] Mirono escooters: I need a job not school üòÄ
[2022-09-15T23:44:33] Jan: I maybe go to france
[2022-09-15T23:45:11] Jan: Toulouse for half a year for a project
[2022-09-15T23:45:44] rosheee: I HAVE WALLET XD
[2022-09-15T23:45:50] Mirono escooters: üò±
[2022-09-15T23:45:52] Mirono escooters: Pass by in Belgium :)
[2022-09-15T23:45:54] rosheee: but u never accept
[2022-09-15T23:46:01] Mirono escooters: You shit money you
[2022-09-15T23:46:09] rosheee: what?
[2022-09-15T23:46:17] Mirono escooters: You shit money üòÇ
[2022-09-15T23:46:31] Mirono escooters: Or spend alot on scooters :p

[2022-09-15T23:55:22] Jan: Amorphous Metal Stator
[2022-09-15T23:55:26] Jan: by Hitachi
[2022-09-15T23:55:40] Jan: But not hollow copper wires
[2022-09-16T01:17:38] Artem Bulashev: Not gonna work hollow because reduced effective cross-section vs outer diamter Increase outer diamter = less parallel threads = less ampacity, or will offset gain from hollow with fluid
[2022-09-16T01:20:02] Artem Bulashev: I‚Äôm sure there are motors that can use such for benefit but typical escooter motor is likely too packed up to get it to benefit amapcity
[2022-09-16T01:45:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: To add information, this was 2 batteries 16S6P 50E so, power is half because I only connect to one battery, not the second :)
[2022-09-16T01:55:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: Xd?
[2022-09-16T01:56:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: How much can reach stock WEPED sst with Kelly and 16s6p?
[2022-09-16T01:56:16] Face de Pin Suc√©: I mean, I only display half of real power
[2022-09-16T01:56:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: Sst is 20S9P
[2022-09-16T01:56:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: This is GTS with 2 16S6P
[2022-09-16T01:56:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: GTS stock is like 95Kmh
[2022-09-16T01:57:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt remind, but someone told me isn‚Äôt WEPED official model but numo made

[2022-09-16T23:58:37] Face de Pin Suc√©: 250R will be shit Still 6 FETS To247 But 24S capable so 125V mosfets meaning worst rdson than 100V mosfets that were already not that good üòÇ
[2022-09-16T23:59:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: Problem is already 250 normal version can‚Äôt handle 250A , 250R never can lol
[2022-09-16T23:59:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: I know, I exploded 4 of them
[2022-09-16T23:59:49] Face de Pin Suc√©: So 250R will be worst
[2022-09-17T00:00:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yah the right maximum current is about 220A max absolute
[2022-09-17T00:00:22] Face de Pin Suc√©: If only it were 6 toll mosfets with proper cooling, it could handle but to 247...
[2022-09-17T00:00:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: And about 180 phase
[2022-09-17T00:00:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: If more will catch fire
[2022-09-17T00:00:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: To 247 is a good package
[2022-09-17T00:00:59] rosheee: Fuck them rly
[2022-09-17T00:01:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes but not as good as toll
[2022-09-17T00:01:08] rosheee: Better we build here suc√© esc
[2022-09-17T00:01:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: The ubox type package can handle more current but worst cooling
[2022-09-17T00:01:16] rosheee: I send ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨
[2022-09-17T00:01:22] rosheee: Then build suc√©
[2022-09-17T00:01:29] rosheee: Flat
[2022-09-17T00:02:19] rosheee: I think rion ceo drunk
[2022-09-17T00:02:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: If your setup is based for no continuos use, ubox type package better . If you have a continuos use then need Suce cooling, to247 better
[2022-09-17T00:02:41] rosheee: Tronic esc doesnt work well
[2022-09-17T00:02:47] rosheee: Failorama FW
[2022-09-17T00:02:57] rosheee: Put 300A phase max current and 100A FW
[2022-09-17T00:03:10] rosheee: Not more boost than 50% of that
[2022-09-17T00:03:22] rosheee: If little focer more suce
[2022-09-17T00:03:26] rosheee: Then use this FW

[2022-09-18T13:19:51] Jan: The color of the disc gives you the temperature
[2022-09-18T13:20:17] Jan: Temper colors
[2022-09-18T13:28:05] Mirono escooters: Alot of kinetic energy
[2022-09-18T13:28:20] Mirono escooters: My brain cannot comprehend we can stop all that weight with some tiny pads and rotors
[2022-09-18T13:28:47] Mirono escooters: Better keep rolling or it can bend from uneven cooling (slow)
[2022-09-18T13:50:27] rosheee: Thanks that u went back to 4th may Btw i didnt made them..i bought them.u csn reach out to swaytronic and help them to get better. Btw dont forget to spotweld battery correct before send to customer. It safes u money and not explpding battery ;-P
[2022-09-18T13:51:09] Jan: Speed is more significant than weight
[2022-09-18T13:55:02] Jan: Energy in the disc in some scenarios: 110kg & 20m/s => 22kJ 110kg & 40m/s => 88kJ 220kg & 20m/s => 44kJ 220kg & 40m/s => 176kJ
[2022-09-18T13:55:54] Jan: From the mass of the disc and the material you can more or less estimate the heat up temp when you transfer the energy into the disc
[2022-09-18T14:01:28] Mirono escooters: Well yea, but i mean that much weight from 60kmh ->0
[2022-09-18T14:02:00] Mirono escooters: My brain just goes doodoo when i think about it that we dissapate all that Into heat
[2022-09-18T14:06:36] Jan: A tank with 50tons at 10m/s has half of the energy of a 1 gram sandgrain at 100'000m/s

[2022-09-19T13:39:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Plug is the cheapest easy solution
[2022-09-19T13:39:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And even that has magic feature soon as its full in no resistance

[2022-09-19T23:33:09] Mirko Boni: But @AJAJ1992 is just the bolt head part! It's not a problem!
[2022-09-19T23:33:16] Mirono escooters: I love mirko enthousiasm with his "!" And energy

[2022-09-19T23:50:39] Mirono escooters: What can go wrong?
[2022-09-20T00:01:22] Artem Bulashev: Guys vesc
[2022-09-20T00:01:27] Jan: I mean PPSU 3D printed plastic works up to 200¬∞C.
[2022-09-20T00:01:27] Artem Bulashev: üòÑüôè
[2022-09-20T00:01:45] Jan: Guys bed
[2022-09-20T00:01:50] Jan: Its midnight
[2022-09-20T00:01:55] Jan: üòÇ
[2022-09-20T00:03:01] Mirono escooters: Nah at midnight brain awake
[2022-09-20T00:07:01] Mirko Boni: Yet it worked very well! It has never been ruined! It never melted! Because it has aluminum discs to dissipate the heat!
[2022-09-20T00:08:35] Mirko Boni: Yes exactly! Plus you add an aluminum disc and bolts that together manage to remove the heat! In fact, I used it for 2000 km without any problem!
[2022-09-20T00:10:35] Artem Bulashev: Disk can get hot to 300 degrees easy!
[2022-09-20T00:11:04] Mirko Boni: It's true! But why have I never had any problems?
[2022-09-20T00:11:04] Artem Bulashev: I would not dare :)
[2022-09-20T00:11:37] Artem Bulashev: Easy going driver I guess. I had my disk go red and shine like a sun on occasion :))
[2022-09-20T00:12:00] Mirko Boni: Do you see the one with the red circle? It's an aluminum disc! There is no direct contact with the brake disc!
[2022-09-20T00:12:10] Mirono escooters: Wait until roschee tries his disks smoke
[2022-09-20T00:12:17] Mirono escooters: You problably just dont get disk hot
[2022-09-20T00:12:34] Mirono escooters: Thats already better, insulation
[2022-09-20T00:12:36] Artem Bulashev: Oh
[2022-09-20T00:12:38] Mirko Boni: But I never manage to destroy the brake disc!
[2022-09-20T00:12:40] Mirono escooters: But still
[2022-09-20T00:12:43] Artem Bulashev: You have aluminum behind
[2022-09-20T00:12:49] Artem Bulashev: And than plastic
[2022-09-20T00:12:50] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2022-09-20T00:13:03] Artem Bulashev: It is likely it won‚Äôt be about 150c there so you should be good
[2022-09-20T00:13:04] Mirko Boni: Yes! Exactly
[2022-09-20T00:13:15] Artem Bulashev: But still sketchy experiment
[2022-09-20T00:13:17] Artem Bulashev: :)
[2022-09-20T00:13:33] Mirko Boni: I never brake so hard that I turn the disc red!
[2022-09-20T00:13:48] Artem Bulashev: Nor would you :)
[2022-09-20T00:14:01] Artem Bulashev: But it gets red around 400c
[2022-09-20T00:14:10] Artem Bulashev: Typical temp can be 250c easy
[2022-09-20T00:14:32] Artem Bulashev: That‚Äôs why I said plastic would not work but with aluminum ring it should be ok
[2022-09-20T00:14:38] Mirko Boni: Yes, you're right!
[2022-09-20T00:15:24] Mirko Boni: In any case, for my safety, I bought a new rim with a disc brake attachment!

[2022-09-20T10:21:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Where do you get this rim and how do you mount it? Do you insert the inner pole thingi?
[2022-09-20T10:24:17] Mirko Boni: Purchased in England! The axle is made to measure with an M10 steel bolt
[2022-09-20T10:25:16] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Ah okay, it is the rim from VTA England(or something?) right?
[2022-09-20T12:57:02] Unknown: Should i avoid ubox single v2 at all cost?
[2022-09-20T12:57:13] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-09-20T12:57:16] Mirono escooters: @kawaiinekololis
[2022-09-20T12:57:28] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes
[2022-09-20T12:57:46] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: You will deal with high temps due to poor thermal design.
[2022-09-20T12:57:57] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I hit 80 degree all the time
[2022-09-20T12:59:16] Unknown: O damn. But you Can choose copper or alumium cooling plate
[2022-09-20T12:59:32] Unknown: Is that new thing or doesnt matter?
[2022-09-20T13:02:23] Mirono escooters: Doesn't matter
[2022-09-20T13:02:33] Mirono escooters: Their fets to heatsink suck.. as i said
[2022-09-20T13:02:58] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2022-09-20T13:04:00] Unknown: O damn
[2022-09-20T13:04:26] Unknown: Yeaa just wanted to double check üòÅ
[2022-09-20T13:08:50] Unknown: But is v1 still better than 75100 ? I did read that it also has heat problems
[2022-09-20T13:11:49] Unknown: Same problem with pcb version?
[2022-09-20T13:12:48] Mirko Boni: Good boy! Just from VTA!
[2022-09-20T13:17:01] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 75100 was cool af on my copper heatsink especially after swapping out MOSFETs
[2022-09-20T13:20:34] Unknown: Is there Any pictures/guides/something about mods?
[2022-09-20T13:21:47] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: The only mod I have done on my Flipsky 75100 is swapping out the MOSFETs with HUASHUO HSP0076A 100V 308A 429W 1.8mŒ©
[2022-09-20T13:22:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and the custom made heatsink
[2022-09-20T13:24:02] Artem Bulashev: Wait for new single to come soon enough
[2022-09-20T13:25:01] Artem Bulashev: Or get flipsky alum but it is missing good features and needs to be checked and re applied to the case
[2022-09-20T13:25:20] Unknown: I have defact v1 controller. They offered me warranty repair or 30% off from v1 or 40% from v2
[2022-09-20T13:25:41] Unknown: I have normal 75100 also
[2022-09-20T13:26:08] Unknown: But is it moddable to make better cooling?
[2022-09-20T13:26:53] Unknown: Does it need to be rechecked?
[2022-09-20T13:27:55] Unknown: Mirono said that its like same as alu and i bought normal
[2022-09-20T13:41:49] Unknown: Do you have picture? üòÑ
[2022-09-20T13:50:57] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: There are just more cheaper fets in single one
[2022-09-20T13:51:36] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ubox dual has better - fairchild ones
[2022-09-20T14:07:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Sure. Let me find them.
[2022-09-20T14:07:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: this
[2022-09-20T14:08:09] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: it was designed for pro2 controller spot
[2022-09-20T14:22:14] Luis Magalhaes: How many amps you push on that and how was the temperature?
[2022-09-20T14:24:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I have used Flipsky 75100 pushing 130A phase and 60A Batt. Temps was about 45-50 worst case on acceleration, but cooled down immediately when reaching top speed/power or when letting go of the throttle.
[2022-09-20T14:25:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: heat transfer from the mosfets to heatsink was very nice
[2022-09-20T14:26:19] Luis Magalhaes: Nice and did you test it befores replacing mosfets?
[2022-09-20T14:26:40] Luis Magalhaes: Just to have an idea üòÅ

[2022-09-20T14:36:41] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Also i have 200A phase and 80-100A each channel battery on ubox dual, no more than 45-50¬∞ fets temp
[2022-09-20T14:42:37] Artem Bulashev: Is it outside??
[2022-09-20T14:43:02] Artem Bulashev: No way for dual ubox to handle 200a phase with 80-100a battery on each channel
[2022-09-20T14:43:12] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: No, roschee helped me with heatsink solutions
[2022-09-20T14:43:21] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2022-09-20T14:43:27] Artem Bulashev: What is front wheel setting ?
[2022-09-20T14:43:43] Artem Bulashev: And that is through resign back of the fet
[2022-09-20T14:44:23] Artem Bulashev: Guess that is what they expected to get on new 100v (but those new fets are a lot worse in conducting heat through resin unlike fets they had in dual ubox)
[2022-09-20T14:44:51] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, the fets on new ones are way cheaper
[2022-09-20T14:44:58] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Dual ubox has good fdbl
[2022-09-20T14:47:54] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Lower it more until it barely freespins on ground
[2022-09-20T14:48:30] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Or load front wheel better with your weight
[2022-09-20T14:50:48] Jan: Would be nice to have a power curve related to rpm
[2022-09-20T14:51:02] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: As @AJAJ1992 said here already, traction control works not so good in vesc, not effective. Turn it off and try to work with phase amps and your throttle manipulation with hands until you feel better grip
[2022-09-20T14:51:06] Jan: Traction control on vesc is crap
[2022-09-20T14:55:17] Jan: On G30 cannot apply more than 30% until 80kph else front wheel goes somewhere ü§∑ Traction control heats up the controllers like 8x. Need power cap to rpm for front motor. Else im not getting the power down
[2022-09-20T14:58:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: Xd? Where u see traction control heat more?
[2022-09-20T14:58:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: Never happen
[2022-09-20T14:58:44] Mirono escooters: 75100 better screwed mos
[2022-09-20T14:58:50] Mirono escooters: Screw like @kawaiinekololis
[2022-09-20T14:59:59] Jan: Ambient: 30¬∞C 2x Pulls from 0-100kph (no traction control) =>30 - 33¬∞C 2x Pulls from 0-100kph (with traction control) =>30 - 70¬∞C
[2022-09-20T15:00:40] Jan: Didnt measure time but it did not feel any faster
[2022-09-20T15:01:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: Traction control is just an algorithm that limit wheel rpm , how can that happen?
[2022-09-20T15:01:30] Jan: ü§∑ i dont know
[2022-09-20T15:01:56] Jan: It felt like the energy got dumped into heat
[2022-09-20T15:01:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: The only possibility is you waste power without it, then less power used without
[2022-09-20T15:27:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: you can't say that, traction control gives you feeling not fast, but when you accelerate side to side with someone you see you're fast So take some time measurements and you'll see if you're faster or not
[2022-09-20T15:27:56] Face de Pin Suc√©: (might feel aggressiv but it's not the idea haha)
[2022-09-20T15:27:59] Jan: Sure i would need to measure time. But for now it doesnt matter when it melts mosfets
[2022-09-20T15:32:27] Jan: Now its like this, credit @roscheeee
[2022-09-20T15:34:43] rosheee: 75v handle
[2022-09-20T15:35:13] rosheee: 100v ubox handled 110A battery each
[2022-09-20T15:35:15] rosheee: and 400A phase
[2022-09-20T15:35:18] rosheee: <animation>

[2022-09-20T15:43:32] Luis Magalhaes: Does traction controll requires halls or it run sensorless?
[2022-09-20T15:56:43] Artem Bulashev: It depends on the mode
[2022-09-20T15:56:54] Artem Bulashev: Both calculate rpm
[2022-09-20T15:57:43] Artem Bulashev: Traction enables when one wheel rpm is higher than other wheel rpm more than than configure threshold value
[2022-09-20T15:59:29] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Sorry, missed this. Mine front is 120A phase and 80A batt
[2022-09-20T16:01:44] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: There is almost no slippage, and a good increase in torque is already with a set of speeds gradually with an increase in battery current
[2022-09-20T16:04:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: And i really working with throttle handling
[2022-09-20T16:04:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Not just on/off thing
[2022-09-20T16:20:57] Artem Bulashev: Strange.
[2022-09-20T16:21:16] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Why
[2022-09-20T16:21:24] Artem Bulashev: My front motor starts slipping at 80a phase and go crazy at 90a phase
[2022-09-20T16:21:58] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: It is thunder motors
[2022-09-20T16:22:11] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: They are heavy
[2022-09-20T16:22:26] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: And ofc center of weight
[2022-09-20T16:22:30] Artem Bulashev: Guess hight kv and higher inertia / diameter
[2022-09-20T16:22:49] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yep, heavier motors
[2022-09-20T16:22:53] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: And tires
[2022-09-20T16:23:13] Artem Bulashev: Yeah mine are 8.5inch and low kv
[2022-09-20T16:23:24] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ah, ok, got itüëç
[2022-09-20T16:23:34] Artem Bulashev: Intersting how large the effect is
[2022-09-20T16:24:14] Artem Bulashev: Guys any other feed back on aluminum single ?
[2022-09-20T16:24:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: You can make slip a etwow motor with 60A
[2022-09-20T16:25:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: While you'll barely move a Weped motor with 60A
[2022-09-20T16:29:06] Mirono escooters: Almost is not enough
[2022-09-20T16:29:06] Mirono escooters: We want fire
[2022-09-20T16:38:06] Artem Bulashev: üòÇ
[2022-09-20T17:05:56] Artem Bulashev: Have intersting news from Spintend - Ubox Single 100a will come with TWO options fets! 1. 80v fets that will result in higher performance than dual ubox v1 2. 100v fets that will result at about same amp setting / temp result as v1 dual ubox That you would like that info üòÅ - dcdc 3a stays for this version as new ‚Äúintegration board‚Äù not yet ready

[2022-09-20T20:41:01] Oliver Eliasson: What is the setting that makes the motors more efficient? And where do i find it. I think some frequency that vesc samples motors with or something?
[2022-09-20T20:41:16] rosheee: ZERO vector
[2022-09-20T20:41:20] rosheee: but u need sweet spot
[2022-09-20T20:41:24] rosheee: ZVF
[2022-09-20T20:41:32] rosheee: and pid and phase settings
[2022-09-20T20:41:36] rosheee: measure phase
[2022-09-20T20:43:41] Oliver Eliasson: What should i put? Can check later tonight. Because now motor heats up to 80-85C¬∞ pretty quick (no ff yet and temp sensor under winding) but vesc go from 28-35C¬∞ so can push that harder
[2022-09-20T20:43:59] rosheee: add FF ^^
[2022-09-20T20:44:12] sombre_enfant: Wich motor ?

[2022-09-20T22:48:14] rosheee: hmmm
[2022-09-20T22:48:22] rosheee: then @PaoloWu send more tires
[2022-09-20T22:48:40] rosheee: where near paris?
[2022-09-20T22:50:30] rosheee: when end of oct?
[2022-09-20T22:50:34] rosheee: need date
[2022-09-20T22:50:41] Face de Pin Suc√©: 22 october

[2022-09-20T22:51:23] rosheee: hmm...maybe to cold
[2022-09-20T22:51:51] rosheee: 4h with tgv or 6h with car (by night without polisisi)
[2022-09-20T22:52:21] rosheee: when u know 100%?
[2022-09-20T22:52:27] rosheee: then we arrive but it was all scam
[2022-09-20T22:52:38] Face de Pin Suc√©: next week I think
[2022-09-20T22:53:54] rosheee: ok
[2022-09-20T23:11:17] Artem Bulashev: Higher pwm max it out
[2022-09-20T23:11:39] Mirono escooters: Max for vesc?
[2022-09-20T23:11:54] rosheee: find it out
[2022-09-20T23:13:35] Artem Bulashev: Yes 30k = 15k in real life and that will make motor most efficient but fets will heat up more
[2022-09-20T23:14:56] Mirono escooters: My vesc overheat, motor not Guess lower frequency lol
[2022-09-20T23:17:24] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2022-09-20T23:17:29] Artem Bulashev: Will help
[2022-09-20T23:21:23] rosheee: My 60A bms cuts
[2022-09-20T23:21:41] rosheee: Specially when low ZVF
[2022-09-20T23:25:42] Artem Bulashev: What is zvf?
[2022-09-20T23:26:02] rosheee: Zero vector frequency
[2022-09-20T23:26:13] Artem Bulashev: Oh ok
[2022-09-20T23:41:51] Oliver Eliasson: 30 battery per motor 85 phase back 80 front
[2022-09-20T23:46:22] Artem Bulashev: That should not over heat without hills
[2022-09-20T23:46:55] Artem Bulashev: Not with dual motor set up
[2022-09-20T23:46:58] Oliver Eliasson: I think so
[2022-09-20T23:47:14] Oliver Eliasson: But many hills hereüòÖ
[2022-09-20T23:47:19] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2022-09-20T23:47:24] Artem Bulashev: Ferrofluid?
[2022-09-20T23:47:29] Oliver Eliasson: Not yet
[2022-09-20T23:47:39] Artem Bulashev: Ok do that and it will solve it as well
[2022-09-20T23:47:47] Artem Bulashev: But better inclrease frequency first
[2022-09-20T23:48:00] Artem Bulashev: Will have to re do motor set up
[2022-09-20T23:48:26] Artem Bulashev: Use higher amps during set up, for some reason I get better motor operation with higher amps during set up instead of standard 10a
[2022-09-20T23:48:33] Oliver Eliasson: Motor att like 60-70 when riding normal and accelerating. Only got on fast accelerating or long hill
[2022-09-20T23:48:56] Oliver Eliasson: What you mean?
[2022-09-20T23:49:33] Artem Bulashev: Mine was 50-60 normal aggressive riding
[2022-09-20T23:49:45] Artem Bulashev: But could be different frequency setting
[2022-09-20T23:50:27] Oliver Eliasson: Okey, could be temp sensor also? As james said the one he got (i have same shows wrong in ambient

[2022-09-21T10:39:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: Fits?
[2022-09-21T10:43:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: No it‚Äôs the tax, more than 150 you pay at delivery
[2022-09-21T11:15:24] Artem Bulashev: That‚Äôs because of Under voltage protection on VESC which BMS reads as Short circuit protection
[2022-09-21T11:15:48] Artem Bulashev: You can run with scooter for 30 sec or more and than jump on it and power on vesc
[2022-09-21T11:15:55] Artem Bulashev: That will work
[2022-09-21T11:19:02] Artem Bulashev: But it happens due to -> over amps = shut BMS off -> voltage drops slowly over 3 seconds = vesc goes to under voltage protection -> BMS reads vesc under voltage as short circuite and goes to Short circuited protection. Running with scooter charges VESV and increases voltage inside VESC -> vesc exits Ubder voltage protection = BMS checks for short circuit every 30sec (check settings) and thus exist SCP after 30 sec -> you can start vesc again
[2022-09-21T11:20:21] Artem Bulashev: Man 200a in logs or in settings?
[2022-09-21T11:21:33] Artem Bulashev: Because I remember your setting was 110-135a front / rear phases if I‚Äôm not mistaken
[2022-09-21T12:33:21] rosheee: 300-400A in log
[2022-09-21T12:33:28] rosheee: Yes for 16S
[2022-09-21T12:33:32] rosheee: But not for 100V
[2022-09-21T12:33:48] rosheee: With 100V ubox in kaabo before rion
[2022-09-21T12:34:37] rosheee: Vesc reads normal voltage then Duty goes 1.5-2% over limit
[2022-09-21T12:39:21] S1m 0n: This is also 200A ü§£
[2022-09-21T12:41:07] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-09-21T12:46:33] S1m 0n: Why is there more amps in the logs or is that correct? With a friend says vesc that he pulls about 65A but the BMS shows only max 30A
[2022-09-21T12:47:05] Mirono escooters: Phase or batt Shit bms or accurate
[2022-09-21T12:52:52] S1m 0n: He had probably converted that from the max watts
[2022-09-21T12:52:53] S1m 0n: <photos/photo_6225@21-09-2022_12-52-53.jpg>
[2022-09-21T12:55:58] S1m 0n: someone else replied that a BMS rarely measures the values, but mostly calculates them and that the vesc is probably more accurate?
[2022-09-21T12:56:33] Mirono escooters: BMS is not as accurate as vesc, but not that much off
[2022-09-21T12:56:36] Mirono escooters: Or its a shite bms
[2022-09-21T12:56:57] S1m 0n: It's LLT (Apple Version app)
[2022-09-21T12:59:01] Mirono escooters: If its been properly assembled.. shouldnt be much off

[2022-09-21T14:45:21] Konstantin: Calibration...and all show ok....
[2022-09-21T15:10:33] Artem Bulashev: It is not 13c too high! It is 50% too high
[2022-09-21T15:11:17] Artem Bulashev: This means when it shows 82c motor 55c
[2022-09-21T15:11:37] Artem Bulashev: Should have used sensor i proposed 100k ntc

[2022-09-21T15:38:59] Artem Bulashev: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NMvH76iks4N1SNl8wmcOBEDCrAd4h6nQ/view?usp=sharing That is the data sheet for J version fets
[2022-09-21T15:40:13] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ubox dual v2 100v has also fdbl0200n100 fets
[2022-09-21T15:40:33] S1m 0n: stupid to use customers as cheap beta testers
[2022-09-21T15:45:19] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: That is the same fets that has 75v v1, but for 100v application
[2022-09-21T15:45:20] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6230@21-09-2022_15-45-20.jpg>

[2022-09-21T15:45:49] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: No cheap shit that in single 100v
[2022-09-21T15:46:54] Artem Bulashev: Non of those were available unfortunately, I wonder how good it would be with proper fets
[2022-09-21T16:02:58] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yea, unfortunately
[2022-09-21T16:13:18] Artem Bulashev: What fets are in 100v single ?
[2022-09-21T16:13:41] Artem Bulashev: Any one tested 75100 Ubox dual J ?
[2022-09-21T16:17:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Same in the ubox j
[2022-09-21T16:18:03] Artem Bulashev: Oh

[2022-09-21T16:21:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: Based in datasheet jmsh should be better, but yeah fake data.
[2022-09-21T16:47:45] Artem Bulashev: Well it may not be because cooling though resin is not intended use
[2022-09-21T16:48:01] Artem Bulashev: J May simply have poor conductivity there
[2022-09-21T16:48:05] Artem Bulashev: Or thicker layer

[2022-09-21T18:34:05] Mirono escooters: Openloop means?
[2022-09-21T18:36:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: Freewheel test current
[2022-09-21T18:36:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: Vesc has that feature that you can test mos efficiency and motor
[2022-09-21T18:36:48] Mirono escooters: Ah
[2022-09-21T18:37:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: 300A on 50mR winding is a lot
[2022-09-21T18:40:23] rosheee: Daly bms shows real data
[2022-09-21T18:44:17] S1m 0n: How u know?
[2022-09-21T18:44:39] Mirono escooters: <animation>
[2022-09-21T18:44:52] Jan: ? 50mŒ© and 300A. I was just U=R*I and its 15V
[2022-09-21T18:45:31] Mirono escooters: Power losses is I^2 √ó R tho?
[2022-09-21T18:46:30] Jan: Can be
[2022-09-21T18:46:49] Jan: P=U*I
[2022-09-21T18:46:51] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_6235@21-09-2022_18-46-51.jpg>
[2022-09-21T18:46:53] Mirono escooters: :)
[2022-09-21T18:47:13] Jan: And then you can replace U with the U=R*I formula
[2022-09-21T18:47:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: The resistance from vesc should be about 20mR per phase
[2022-09-21T18:47:33] Mirono escooters: Just extra step, same result
[2022-09-21T18:47:40] Jan: P=I^2*R
[2022-09-21T18:47:43] Jan: Yes
[2022-09-21T18:47:44] Mirono escooters: :)
[2022-09-21T18:49:32] Face de Pin Suc√©: "during transmission"
[2022-09-21T18:49:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: Problem, Openloop is 100% power losses x)
[2022-09-21T18:49:50] Mirono escooters: Rlly?
[2022-09-21T18:49:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: You push currents with no torque at all
[2022-09-21T18:50:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: Motor is spinning at 100ERPM
[2022-09-21T18:50:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes only for test
[2022-09-21T18:50:22] Mirono escooters: Same formula should apply, no?
[2022-09-21T18:50:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: But output is likely 1v and 300A
[2022-09-21T18:51:18] Mirono escooters: =4500w
[2022-09-21T18:51:21] Mirono escooters: Problably correct
[2022-09-21T18:51:47] Mirono escooters: I am intrigued by efficienty testing motor. How can i do it non destructive?

[2022-09-21T19:16:14] Face de Pin Suc√©: <sticker>
[2022-09-21T19:32:14] Mirono escooters: Where do you set MOSFETs frequency?
[2022-09-21T19:35:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: What mosfet frequency?
[2022-09-21T19:35:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Mosfet frequency is same as mktor
[2022-09-21T19:35:38] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Foc -> advanced. Zero vector freq
[2022-09-21T19:36:53] Mirono escooters: Ok, lower, mosfets heat less motor more
[2022-09-21T19:37:05] Mirono escooters: Bcs my vesc overheating
[2022-09-21T19:37:20] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Set it to 25-30kHz
[2022-09-21T19:37:54] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 40kHz by default is too much
[2022-09-21T19:38:04] Mirono escooters: Oki
[2022-09-21T19:53:20] sombre_enfant: 16khz best
[2022-09-21T19:54:53] Artem Bulashev: Lower PWM frequency ALSO should improve ow end torque
[2022-09-21T19:55:06] Mirono escooters: Rlly??
[2022-09-21T19:55:21] Artem Bulashev: 16 kHz setting or 32khz setting ? Because vesc does 1/2 sample I believe
[2022-09-21T19:56:49] Artem Bulashev: That is a case in drones - ALOT of difference between 32 and 8khz
[2022-09-21T19:57:33] sombre_enfant: No 16/8
[2022-09-21T19:58:47] Artem Bulashev: Motors are cooler USUALLY on higher kHz, but on rare cases motor may not work well on high khz due to some kind electromagnetic resonances. Don‚Äôt think this will happen with larger escooter motors due to low rpm
[2022-09-21T19:58:56] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2022-09-21T20:00:22] Mirono escooters: Ebike* here
[2022-09-21T20:00:33] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 32kHz zero vector freq will be 16kHz pwm
[2022-09-21T20:00:53] Mirono escooters: Ok. I try diff settings, vesc just too hot. Waiting for time in winter to mod heatsink
[2022-09-21T20:02:37] Artem Bulashev: That‚Äôs what I thought yeah
[2022-09-21T20:03:33] Artem Bulashev: I see
[2022-09-21T20:03:37] Artem Bulashev: That explains

[2022-09-22T20:20:14] Mirko Boni: Hi @ AJAJ1992, I haven't measured yet! I'll do it in half an hour!
[2022-09-22T21:37:46] Mirko Boni: @AJAJ1992 I measured! Without the weight of the pilot, 7.5 cm from the ground to the radiator
[2022-09-22T21:38:42] Jan: And from frame bottom?
[2022-09-22T21:39:41] Mirko Boni: I didn't measure that figure! I do it immediately!
[2022-09-22T21:42:44] Mirko Boni: 10,5 cm
[2022-09-22T21:48:12] Jan: Ah thats with frame
[2022-09-22T21:49:04] Mirko Boni: Yess exactly
[2022-09-22T21:49:11] Mirko Boni: 1,5 cm frame
[2022-09-22T21:49:20] Jan: This distance
[2022-09-22T21:49:20] Mirko Boni: 1,5 cm radiator
[2022-09-22T21:49:29] Mirko Boni: 3 cm
[2022-09-22T21:49:36] Jan: Ah ok nice
[2022-09-22T21:49:52] Jan: I see most extension are about 30mm(+-10mm)
[2022-09-22T21:50:06] Mirko Boni: Aesthetically silver with black? I'm not sure!

[2022-09-22T23:04:21] Artem Bulashev: We need to get 120$ vesc dash done
[2022-09-22T23:04:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: üò±
[2022-09-22T23:05:01] Artem Bulashev: With police mode settings stored on eeprom and activated on power up + over write by a combination of the inputs
[2022-09-22T23:05:23] Artem Bulashev: Ideally not even dash board - not display
[2022-09-22T23:05:45] Artem Bulashev: But integrator so that cheap common displays can be used
[2022-09-22T23:05:57] Artem Bulashev: Mini motor / qs-s4 to begin with, later can be FW updated to include more
[2022-09-22T23:06:53] Artem Bulashev: Display + case + glass + custom wires are the most expensive parts. Integrated needs non of those
[2022-09-22T23:10:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: Xd, before clone rion now clone @koxx3 , should invent something new üò¢
[2022-09-22T23:28:46] asyan4ik: OMFG
[2022-09-23T00:21:19] Artem Bulashev: 1. There is not high of Rion on Spin-Y. 2. There is nothing on koxx display, I asked him for his plans on integrator, but he said it won‚Äôt be done. Also kind of impossible to clone what doesn‚Äôt exist. (Idea of using oem display for vesc have been discussed for over 5 years now)
[2022-09-23T07:33:11] S1m 0n: Yep üëç
[2022-09-23T07:51:43] Mirono escooters: How you made it?
[2022-09-23T07:53:05] S1m 0n: I would also like to have such a translated board. for the vsett/kaabo display. the vesc display is out of the question for me.. it's ugly and you can see that it doesn't originally belong to the scooter
[2022-09-23T07:54:27] S1m 0n: I'm from Germany, stupid guidelines and laws. everything must be insured and standardized
[2022-09-23T07:55:27] Mirono escooters: I need one
[2022-09-23T07:55:42] S1m 0n: It's not really known but it's very similar to a other display witch is documentary
[2022-09-23T07:55:46] S1m 0n: Yep this one
[2022-09-23T07:56:14] S1m 0n: http://github.com/teixeluis/escooter-lcd-esc-decode
[2022-09-23T07:56:40] S1m 0n: a few memory addresses are different, but overall it's the same
[2022-09-23T07:59:56] S1m 0n: that's a great idea too. I also find ePaper displays very interesting, but my knowledge is not sufficient to design something like this from scratch :/
[2022-09-23T08:03:44] S1m 0n: Yes I know. but ePapers are still relatively new. maybe the technology will be further in a few yearsüòç
[2022-09-23T10:52:13] S1m 0n: Perhaps this will also help later. The red P-Settings are from Kaabo. The P-Settings from Kaabo and the QS display are the same @Mihail
[2022-09-23T11:40:24] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Oh that's nice. You've done exactly what I wanted to do (and already started with it) before the Lisp implementation came up.
[2022-09-23T11:41:39] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and after that I just threw it into the garbage. üòÖ
[2022-09-23T11:45:16] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, it's all done by software trickery.
[2022-09-23T11:45:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Your solution is probably better, but you done it the "hard way".
[2022-09-23T11:46:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: BMS can be possible as well, but you would need more UART ports on the VESC itself.
[2022-09-23T11:47:01] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: by software
[2022-09-23T11:48:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No üòÖ That's what I meant with software trickery, but for a normal user it actually feels like it is off or it's exactly like xiaomi button behaviour. The off function only has use for like train etc
[2022-09-23T11:48:58] S1m 0n: Is it also possible to make a lisp script for Kaabo/Vsett?
[2022-09-23T11:49:09] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, if protocol is known, very easy.
[2022-09-23T11:49:23] S1m 0n: A speed indicator would be enough for me
[2022-09-23T12:04:59] Artem Bulashev: Awesome, now we need to add more protocols to this :) so that it can work with other scooters screens :) Amazing one mate!
[2022-09-23T12:06:15] Artem Bulashev: Vsett and zero qs-s4 (which is used on many other scooters) have same protocol and cross compatible), so adding simple qs-s4 would add about 20 scooters and even vsett display support by definition üôÇ
[2022-09-23T12:08:10] Artem Bulashev: So true that, but must look oem to use vesc, that‚Äôs the point + ease of conversion for new people
[2022-09-23T12:08:40] Artem Bulashev: There is new vsett display though 120$ large TFT panel in the center
[2022-09-23T12:08:56] Artem Bulashev: <video_file>
[2022-09-23T12:09:36] Artem Bulashev: Rfid is independent system inside display, so it would still work as well as a lock
[2022-09-23T12:10:53] Artem Bulashev: This display is also same protocol as all qs-s4 and vsett old diplay and even new MUKUTA scooters
[2022-09-23T12:25:23] S1m 0n: Yes ist segment Display. It's not a TFT or lcd
[2022-09-23T12:26:33] S1m 0n: U also can call it analog dispaly .. new cover but old technology
[2022-09-23T12:29:21] S1m 0n: Yes I have already heard that the readability has been significantly improved at least the speed and the gear should always be legible. My new Vsett display will arrive today :D
[2022-09-23T12:29:48] Mirono escooters: Ohh the big new released?
[2022-09-23T12:49:13] Konstantin: Need nfc and possibly unlock by phone, w/o physical tag
[2022-09-23T12:50:31] Mirono escooters: Nfc so cool
[2022-09-23T12:51:58] S1m 0n: I no longer need the NFC since I know how easy you can bypass the lock ü§£.. and that had not even I found out myself, but n colleague who has not even n eScooter ü§£
[2022-09-23T12:52:37] S1m 0n: NFC is cool, but poorly implemented
[2022-09-23T12:53:45] S1m 0n: Maybe also good if you have lost all your NFC tags somehow, to reset. But the way is made too easy, 30seconds and anyone can steal your scooter, without extra tools.
[2022-09-23T12:54:20] S1m 0n: Big City Life
[2022-09-23T12:58:47] Artem Bulashev: Ok, so would work like xiomi - speed / error/ light on off / brake indicator / battery indicator
[2022-09-23T13:00:20] Artem Bulashev: Don‚Äôt know if the new one has same trick to reset
[2022-09-23T13:05:43] S1m 0n: I will try it later üëç
[2022-09-23T13:13:57] Artem Bulashev: Nfc is implemented on second uart (first for communication with controller )
[2022-09-23T13:16:57] Artem Bulashev: In theory it could be passed through integration board but Neh, that is than vsett specific rather than all sq-s4/vsett type in general. Though nfc could than be used for alarm as well if accelerometer is added. Any one touches scooter in Armed condition without putting tag with with in 5sec = alarm output on
[2022-09-23T13:17:04] Artem Bulashev: Just thinking ahead
[2022-09-23T13:18:03] Artem Bulashev: You can use any Bank card with PayPass or put 0.1mm thick rfid sticker under phone case üôÇ
[2022-09-23T13:23:02] S1m 0n: Or like the rental scooters, when you move the tires, they lock up.
[2022-09-23T13:23:32] S1m 0n: Like that
[2022-09-23T13:25:37] Artem Bulashev: Yeah some android support natively actually passive tag emulation
[2022-09-23T13:26:09] Artem Bulashev: Also yeah but that would require adc to uart conversion than on board
[2022-09-23T13:27:18] Artem Bulashev: Actually yeah you can set amp via uart while throttle is connected via adc
[2022-09-23T13:28:11] Artem Bulashev: Accelerometer could be good I think as it can be carried over air without alarm. To be honest all of this is useless
[2022-09-23T13:28:46] Artem Bulashev: Unless there is IMMEDIATE notification to your phone as soon as scooter is moved. Only than you can save it, thieves cut locks with angle grinders in the middle of London busy streets‚Ä¶
[2022-09-23T13:34:27] S1m 0n: Same :/
[2022-09-23T13:53:50] Konstantin: Can unlock by card/phone. Googluck bypass it ;)
[2022-09-23T13:58:10] S1m 0n: I'm sure flipper can do it, if it's copy ur card ü§™

[2022-09-23T15:53:21] S1m 0n: What's the diffrent to normal charger ?
[2022-09-23T15:55:18] Mirono escooters: Adjustable 0-90v 0-5a 350w max
[2022-09-23T15:55:36] Mirono escooters: Since i got soo many different batteries and stuff, having 1 all in 1 Charger...
[2022-09-23T15:55:44] Mirono escooters: Otherwise 6 different wich you always loose
[2022-09-23T16:01:17] Artem Bulashev: How well it switches CC to CV? At what cell voltage?
[2022-09-23T16:01:45] Artem Bulashev: Mine does at like 4.17v per cellüòÑ but I was able to get FULL refund because of it
[2022-09-23T16:01:56] Artem Bulashev: So best free goody to date ü§£

[2022-09-23T21:48:42] Mirono escooters: Is 99% duty ok? Safe?
[2022-09-23T21:48:51] asyan4ik: I use
[2022-09-23T22:07:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: Max 98 as my recommendation
[2022-09-23T22:07:45] Mirono escooters: Ok
[2022-09-23T22:12:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: already tried 99% once, but I keep it maximum 96%
[2022-09-23T22:18:22] Mirko Boni: Thank you Paolo!
[2022-09-23T22:18:53] Mirko Boni: In your opinion @PaoloWu with 16s 79 km / h with the wheel raised is not little?
[2022-09-23T22:35:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: 1kmh more maybe at freewheel
[2022-09-23T22:35:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt have vsett motor, but i think it‚Äôs normal
[2022-09-23T22:36:22] Mirono escooters: Whats the point then
[2022-09-23T22:44:01] Unknown: Can i get 100a discharge rate from like 13s3 battery and is it benefical and what motor i need like? Monorim 500w ok?
[2022-09-23T22:45:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: Depends by cell, if you are talking about monorim shit pack be sure not
[2022-09-23T22:50:20] Unknown: Yea but if you buy right cells
[2022-09-23T22:51:09] Unknown: Like cell with 35discharge current
[2022-09-23T22:52:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: With p42a/40T/VTC7A yes
[2022-09-23T22:52:55] Unknown: I have 16s4p 18650 battery with 30A discharge? Can i series it with 21700 battery with like 70A discharge
[2022-09-23T22:53:17] Unknown: Do i end with somekind of problem?
[2022-09-23T22:54:14] Unknown: I have like 30 diacharge rate on my current battery. Do i have series it with 3 batteries to get good 100A
[2022-09-23T22:54:19] Unknown: That works
[2022-09-24T02:23:45] rosheee: ???
[2022-09-24T02:41:43] rosheee: @SibClimb looks like @AJAJ1992 and me coming
[2022-09-24T02:41:49] rosheee: checking for car tomorrow
[2022-09-24T05:27:29] Face de Pin Suc√©: For track ?
[2022-09-24T08:40:03] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Its hard, but possible. Need a lot of phase and battery current here
[2022-09-24T09:07:26] sombre_enfant: Seems normal
[2022-09-24T09:09:27] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Depends on kv and voltage. Seems no problem at all here
[2022-09-24T09:09:39] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: FW can be used
[2022-09-24T09:11:49] sombre_enfant: He on 16s 80 freewheel is about right and 70 on road
[2022-09-24T09:12:08] sombre_enfant: Yeah rosheee mysteriously reach 100kph
[2022-09-24T09:12:12] sombre_enfant: But its fw
[2022-09-24T09:56:06] Mirko Boni: Are you sure it's a mystery?

[2022-09-24T10:40:23] Face de Pin Suc√©: I happened once on a very torque setup I did but because I was putting a lot of weight on the front to prevent it slip üòÇ
[2022-09-24T10:41:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's about motors, I reached 118kmh on 10.5inch 16S on my Weped
[2022-09-24T10:41:26] sombre_enfant: I mean not 100% same but 95% alike same motor(Vsett10) , same battery potential16s5p murata ant mirko 16s6p p42A 16s5p 50g, same controller just newer model for mirko
[2022-09-24T10:42:24] sombre_enfant: They're same...
[2022-09-24T10:42:54] sombre_enfant: Answer pm pls
[2022-09-24T10:43:07] Face de Pin Suc√©: If they have same motors, it means roschee is pushing more amps to match the max speed
[2022-09-24T10:43:09] sombre_enfant: Need suc√© advise
[2022-09-24T10:44:00] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Roscheee uses a lot of fw, means a lot of current on top
[2022-09-24T10:44:13] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: He said. About 35-50A of fw
[2022-09-24T10:44:31] sombre_enfant: Try without field weakening and normal current first then adjust dont focus on other ppl setup
[2022-09-24T10:46:39] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, without fw you will have more efficiency, less heat at final rpms on road. So its very optional function and use it only when you know what you are doing
[2022-09-24T10:48:42] sombre_enfant: Without fw and similare motor not same vesc nor batterie i had about same speed
[2022-09-24T13:51:27] rosheee: Idk how many fw i used...xD 16S6P i never reached ovwr 90kmh ahahha
[2022-09-24T13:51:31] rosheee: 16S5P did ut

[2022-09-24T20:13:40] sombre_enfant: But great
[2022-09-24T20:14:17] Jan: 100kph+ is possible
[2022-09-24T20:14:20] Jan: With FW

[2022-09-24T22:42:20] Artem Bulashev: That is not how you suppose to use thermal paste üòÖ
[2022-09-24T22:43:02] Face de Pin Suc√©: @artBula what's going on with spin-Y I read somewhere that spintend stop sales
[2022-09-24T22:44:40] Jan: Better than an air gap between Vesc housing and radiator plate ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2022-09-24T22:44:42] Artem Bulashev: Yes stoped it till batch 2 is ready
[2022-09-24T22:46:29] Artem Bulashev: A lot of changes to FW - custom throttle curve - new calibration process - changed CNC parts to optimize for different aspects - cruise button now will have internal connection to work by it self Only will start selling once batch 2 is finished. Any one with batch 1 that will want solution will get be able to get new PCB+lower case + wire = all pre assembled. So it is simply a matter of swapping it by 2 screws (15sec job)
[2022-09-24T22:51:15] Mirko Boni: I did not understand your sentence! I use the translator!
[2022-09-24T22:51:37] Jan: Deepl.com
[2022-09-24T22:51:43] Jan: best translator in existance
[2022-09-24T22:52:04] Mirko Boni: Jan, I don't understand! But is thermal paste a problem?
[2022-09-24T22:53:43] Mirko Boni: Why isn't that how it's used? Under the control unit the thickness of the dough is very small!
[2022-09-24T22:55:00] Mirko Boni: Jan, I used very little thermal paste! That outside is accumulated material!
[2022-09-24T22:55:28] Mirko Boni: In fact, the vesc temperature is perfect!
[2022-09-24T22:55:38] Jan: In my opinion its totally fine
[2022-09-24T22:56:00] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_6267@24-09-2022_14-19-43.jpg>
[2022-09-24T22:56:36] Jan: Yeah i did the same to bridge a thermal surface
[2022-09-24T22:57:37] Jan: For me purpose, transfer heat, apply it where else would be an air gap ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2022-09-24T22:57:56] Mirko Boni: Did it work well in your vesc?
[2022-09-24T22:58:50] Jan: Yeah for me its between an alu mounting plate and the radiator as i could not manufacture those in one piece
[2022-09-24T22:59:10] Jan: i mean in switzerland i would pay for a cnc floorplate 300‚Ç¨+
[2022-09-24T22:59:16] Mirko Boni: Ok ok perfect! I understand!
[2022-09-24T22:59:36] Jan: Lasercut floor plate + radiator as extruded profile is just a lot cheaper
[2022-09-24T22:59:47] Mirko Boni: My plate cost 170 euros
[2022-09-24T23:00:35] Jan: My floor costed me 80‚Ç¨ in switzerland complete.
[2022-09-24T23:00:56] Jan: 4x cheaper than cnc
[2022-09-24T23:01:01] Mirko Boni: 80 euros ergal, 90 euros the person who made the cut
[2022-09-24T23:01:18] Mirko Boni: Woow! Fantastic
[2022-09-24T23:01:39] Jan: Lasercut alu plate and extruded profile radiator would cost probably 20‚Ç¨ in china if i order 4pcs+
[2022-09-24T23:01:56] Jan: but then you need thermal paste in between
[2022-09-24T23:02:32] Mirko Boni: Yes exactly!
[2022-09-24T23:02:49] Mirko Boni: Your project is great too!
[2022-09-24T23:03:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: Why ergal ? Ergal is more expensive and conduct less than standard anticorrodal 6061‚Ä¶
[2022-09-24T23:07:56] Mirko Boni: No Paolo! You are wrong! Ergal is the best conductive material! And it is the most resistant to blows!
[2022-09-24T23:08:22] Mirko Boni: It is the best corrosion resistant aluminum!
[2022-09-24T23:59:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_6271@24-09-2022_23-59-28.jpg>
[2022-09-24T23:59:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_6272@24-09-2022_23-59-40.jpg>
[2022-09-25T00:00:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ergal is stringers in the mechanical application , but not at thermal conductivity
[2022-09-25T00:00:38] Mirko Boni: Ergal 7075 L'Alluminio 7075, il cui nome commerciale √® Ergal, √® una lega di alluminio e zinco nata per l'utilizzo in aereonautica nelle parti strutturali dei veicoli. √à la lega d'alluminio pi√π leggera ma anche la pi√π resistente agli urti, agli sforzi, al peso e alla torsione. Quindi risulta essere la migliore dal punto di vista meccanico. Inoltre √® la lega meno soggetta a "termodilatazione", risulta quindi molto utile per utilizzo in ambienti esterni dato che meglio sopporta cambiamenti di temperatura (caldo e freddo).
[2022-09-25T00:01:01] Mirko Boni: Ergal 7075 Aluminum 7075, whose trade name is Ergal, is an aluminum-zinc alloy created for use in aircraft in structural parts of vehicles. It is the lightest aluminum alloy but also the most resistant to impact, stress, weight and torsion. So it turns out to be the best from a mechanical point of view. It is also the alloy least prone to "thermodilation," so it is very useful for outdoor use since it better withstands temperature changes (hot and cold).

[2022-09-25T00:03:15] Mirko Boni: However Paul, we are talking about small differences, even if it were as you say! To me, it's enough to see how the temperature of the Vesc holds up perfectly to the efforts and the large current delivery!
[2022-09-25T00:03:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: Non ce nulla di scritto a riguardo della conducibilit√† termica
[2022-09-25T00:04:49] Mirko Boni: But have you seen my video? Did you see the temperature? It doesn't exceed 50¬∞, this is a small video, but I used the scooter for half an hour and it never got hot!
[2022-09-25T00:08:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: At the first point, i was talking about the cost, 6060/6061 is best for your use. And the ubox v2‚Äôs thermal sensor is an smd chip that read temperature from thermal pad, then the temperature you see is wrong and no real time, this is fixed in new ubox single.
[2022-09-25T00:13:58] Jan: Lets not go too deep into material, i mean the topic is still scooters and not aircrafts. 6061 is cheaper than 7075 and that is why you probably never see 7075 outside of high end applications/ aerospace.
[2022-09-25T00:15:10] Jan: What i learned in my years as an engineer: There is usually almost always a way to solve a problem without going into high-end materials or insane machining tolerances.
[2022-09-25T00:15:45] Mirko Boni: Sorry Paul, but why did you make me buy the Ubox if it has these problems? I bought it on your precise recommendation! Now it turns out to be no good?
[2022-09-25T00:16:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: Was the better on the market
[2022-09-25T00:16:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: Otherwise you don‚Äôt want spend 2 x 1200$ for a TRONIC 750
[2022-09-25T00:17:09] Mirko Boni: ok ok....

[2022-09-25T00:17:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Times ago was no available
[2022-09-25T00:17:46] Jan: Still needs testing, ill do next week
[2022-09-25T00:18:10] Mirko Boni: Jan, I'm keeping this one now! If I had known earlier I would not have taken ubox V2..
[2022-09-25T00:19:31] Jan: The ubox should be bad either. @roscheeee did some insane things already
[2022-09-25T00:19:52] Jan: Like 16s Ninebot G30 at 108kph with Ubox
[2022-09-25T00:20:28] Jan: Im no electronics specialist. This would probably be @artBula here
[2022-09-25T00:22:01] Mirko Boni: I talked to Rosheee and he told me that ubox V2 is fine! It is not a bad product!
[2022-09-25T00:22:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: For your use is very good
[2022-09-25T00:22:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: We using different power and have different problems
[2022-09-25T00:24:24] Mirko Boni: Paul, I am 47 years old and a good guy! I am not reckless! So I will not do the scooter races!
[2022-09-25T00:25:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yeah, ubox is pretty enough for you
[2022-09-25T00:26:54] Mirko Boni: Thanks Paul, I don't think it will warm up that much with me!
[2022-09-25T02:40:16] rosheee: WITH THE SETTINGS I GAVE YOU XD? what
[2022-09-25T02:40:43] rosheee: why shit in the pants xD? the settings are just normal :D

[2022-09-25T02:42:47] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-09-25T02:42:47] Mirko Boni: Skid the wheel in front
[2022-09-25T02:42:58] rosheee: then we change some parameters
[2022-09-25T02:43:03] Mirko Boni: I reached 84 km / h
[2022-09-25T02:43:18] rosheee: XD AND U CRIED BECAUSE THE SCOOTER IN YOUTUBE REACHED 191KMH
[2022-09-25T02:43:25] rosheee: XD AND NOW U SHIT UR PANTS AT 84KMH?
[2022-09-25T02:43:26] Mirko Boni: The scooter is very stable!

[2022-09-25T02:44:56] Mirko Boni: Yess exactly
[2022-09-25T11:09:00] Artem Bulashev: Best heat transfer is meta to metal
[2022-09-25T11:10:32] Artem Bulashev: How ever due to metal not being 100% flat and even, we need to use thermal paste, but only, and only to fill in the gap! We don‚Äôt want thermal paste to be like a pad, we want to maintain metal to metal contact where it is possible
[2022-09-25T11:10:51] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6273@25-09-2022_11-10-51.jpg>
[2022-09-25T11:10:56] Artem Bulashev: Example
[2022-09-25T11:11:12] rosheee: direct die better ^^
[2022-09-25T11:21:39] Mirko Boni: Thanks for your advice! But I repeat that I used very little thermal paste!
[2022-09-25T16:50:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: re-designed for CNC manufacturing finished ... I'll be able to launch a new prototype production
[2022-09-25T16:55:31] Jan: My opinion: Would be nice if you could get rid of the black frame
[2022-09-25T16:56:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: totally impossible. we already cut to the minimum
[2022-09-25T16:56:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: needs room for glass adhesive & CNC "square corners"
[2022-09-25T16:57:10] S1m 0n: Can you deselect individual elements? The maximum speed could be your undoing ü§™
[2022-09-25T16:57:13] Jan: <photos/photo_6275@25-09-2022_16-57-13.jpg>
[2022-09-25T16:57:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and for left/right, there are no "no border" LCD available for such technology
[2022-09-25T16:57:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it you engage speed limiter, max speed is reduced to legal limit üòú
[2022-09-25T16:58:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, and if you look at it, there is also a big border for the TFT controller
[2022-09-25T16:59:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: believe me, we looked at a looooot of options. unless you want to spend a LOOOOOT of $$$ for premium manufacturing (like smartphones), it's simply not possible to get few millimeters less üòî
[2022-09-25T20:19:36] Mirono escooters: Question @SibClimb why you race with weped frame? Is it best, or rules?
[2022-09-25T22:02:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: I don't anymore haha
[2022-09-25T22:02:23] Face de Pin Suc√©: But I liked a lot racing with it
[2022-09-25T22:02:46] Mirono escooters: Aha wich frame u use?
[2022-09-25T22:02:48] Mirono escooters: Why?
[2022-09-25T22:02:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: Dualtron compact
[2022-09-25T22:03:13] Mirono escooters: ü•µ
[2022-09-25T22:03:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: I drove it for a very long time, so I was used to it
[2022-09-25T22:03:31] Mirono escooters: Aha
[2022-09-25T22:03:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: But dualtron compact/thunder much better for racing purposes
[2022-09-25T22:03:51] Mirono escooters: So its more preference then how good it is
[2022-09-25T22:03:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes
[2022-09-25T22:04:29] Mirono escooters: Ok Racing w xiaomi

[2022-09-25T22:21:53] Mirono escooters: Who cares about that
[2022-09-25T22:22:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yah my battery dead after holiday when I forgot unplug qs8 because was so hard xd
[2022-09-25T22:23:17] asyan4ik: Smart BMS :) Today was the first trip and test. I don't even have a charger for my battery. I charge with a charger from a 20s monocycle 1.5a , my battery is 55a/h
[2022-09-25T22:25:07] Mirono escooters: Bruh its 5-8mah
[2022-09-25T22:25:13] Mirono escooters: Smart BMS for the W

[2022-09-25T22:34:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: Smart bms self turn off Bluetooth after 3hour normally
[2022-09-25T22:34:32] Mirono escooters: Nah u disable it
[2022-09-25T22:34:53] Mirono escooters: Ant bms all day on Bluetooth..
[2022-09-25T22:35:11] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-09-25T22:35:19] Mirono escooters: Daly u can disable it 15300 sleeptime
[2022-09-25T22:35:30] Mirono escooters: Llt disable sleeptime
[2022-09-25T22:37:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yah then ant bms consumpt current
[2022-09-25T22:37:34] Mirko Boni: Woow! Interesting!
[2022-09-25T22:37:53] Mirono escooters: Bluetooth ultra low sleep? Yea dont think so
[2022-09-25T22:37:59] Mirono escooters: Microamps.. dont shit on nothing
[2022-09-25T22:38:08] Mirono escooters: Ant is the best
[2022-09-25T22:39:18] Mirono escooters: Well with it still fire hazard, if itd build bad
[2022-09-25T22:39:55] Konstantin: Depends on settings...all like usual, can fix all ;)
[2022-09-25T22:40:13] Mirono escooters: Indeed..
[2022-09-25T22:40:26] Mirono escooters: But ignorance is worse then dumb.. üò≥üôÉ
[2022-09-25T22:40:42] Mirono escooters: Bms is ofcourse quicker then a fuse.
[2022-09-25T22:40:47] Konstantin: It's consuming not much, led blinking...
[2022-09-25T22:40:57] Konstantin: Cut led;))
[2022-09-25T22:41:19] Mirono escooters: If your batt is drained by that Consider a new battery
[2022-09-25T22:42:16] Konstantin: Use LLT, it's has on/off switch, and easy to connect, not like trash ant
[2022-09-25T22:45:24] Mirono escooters: Its not on Allieexpress with that name
[2022-09-25T22:51:30] S1m 0n: Yep üëç

[2022-09-25T22:51:57] Mirono escooters: Indeed
[2022-09-25T22:52:51] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-09-25T22:52:54] Mirono escooters: As all bmses do
[2022-09-25T23:00:18] Mirono escooters: Botox is problably programmed worse then official
[2022-09-25T23:00:33] Mirono escooters: It reactivates, or worst case manually through Bluetooth
[2022-09-25T23:00:43] Mirono escooters: U can eben set how long delay is before activating..
[2022-09-25T23:10:34] Mirko Boni: Is this product for sale? Do you have any demonstration videos?
[2022-09-25T23:11:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not yet for sale. for end of year. i've made some videos. check my facebook group. https://www.facebook.com/groups/smartelec/?ref=share
[2022-09-25T23:12:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: or the webpage : smartelec.eu.org
[2022-09-25T23:24:14] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_6284@25-09-2022_23-24-14.jpg>
[2022-09-25T23:24:18] Mirono escooters: Ubox go brr
[2022-09-25T23:24:35] Mirono escooters: Nvm not Ubox
[2022-09-25T23:24:38] Mirono escooters: Still vesc
[2022-09-26T00:00:29] Mirko Boni: Can it also be used with vesc?
[2022-09-26T00:01:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2022-09-26T00:01:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: vesc, minimotors, vsett, kelly, kaboo, apollo...
[2022-09-26T00:03:04] Mirko Boni: Ok! I like this! In the vesc configuration, what do the buttons allow you to set?
[2022-09-26T00:05:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: change speed, max current, accel, lights, cruise control, turn indicators... fully configurable from ios/android app
[2022-09-26T00:06:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: some people even asked if it could to change the smartphone music from thoses buttons. what do you think about such option ?
[2022-09-26T00:16:25] Mirko Boni: I honestly don't think it's important to change the music, but I'm interested in changing the power profiles on the vesc and selecting single or dual motor!
[2022-09-26T00:17:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: power profiles, no pb
[2022-09-26T00:17:31] Mirko Boni: Wonderful! üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
[2022-09-26T00:18:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: single/dual, bad idea (already explained multiple times here and many groups üòÖ)
[2022-09-26T00:18:26] Mirko Boni: Sorry I didn't know!
[2022-09-26T00:19:57] Mirko Boni: This is not a problem, I have the spinted ADC module that allows the installation of the button to select the motors!
[2022-09-26T00:20:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no problem, to make it quick : single/dual have 0 interest (and can damage controllers/motors). most people use it only to have something less agressive, but with power modes, no need any more.
[2022-09-26T00:21:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: Italy is no legit 2 motor
[2022-09-26T00:21:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: Max 1 power motor
[2022-09-26T00:21:31] Mirko Boni: Ok perfect! So are you planning to sell it in 2023?
[2022-09-26T00:21:39] Mirko Boni: Exactly!
[2022-09-26T00:21:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: end of this year, yes
[2022-09-26T00:22:15] Mirko Boni: Is the price top secret? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2022-09-26T00:22:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok, but when they see a motor instead of a simple wheel, police doesn't react ?
[2022-09-26T00:22:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: More than 300‚Ç¨ if not wrong
[2022-09-26T00:22:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for legel purpose, ok, it could be interesting
[2022-09-26T00:22:54] Mirko Boni: Ok! Thank you
[2022-09-26T00:23:22] Mirko Boni: The police could seize the scooter
[2022-09-26T00:23:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 300e, it was for prototypes üòÖ final product will be 400e
[2022-09-26T00:23:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: Law talking only about power motor, not brake motor.
[2022-09-26T00:23:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: You can tell they it‚Äôs only for e-brake
[2022-09-26T00:23:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: <animation>
[2022-09-26T00:23:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: good !
[2022-09-26T00:23:55] koxx / Francois Deslandes: then we can do something interesting üòÅ
[2022-09-26T00:24:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: when in legal mode : 1 motor... and outside, 2 motors üòÅ
[2022-09-26T00:24:34] Mirko Boni: Interesting
[2022-09-26T00:24:51] Mirko Boni: Exactly
[2022-09-26T00:25:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i'll check what can be done.
[2022-09-26T13:22:25] Oliver Eliasson: Maybe wrong place to ask, but how is this switch wired internerly?
[2022-09-26T13:23:35] Oliver Eliasson: I thought, when in middle only one wire connected. When to left left and middle shorted, when to right, right and middle shorted?
[2022-09-26T13:24:33] Oliver Eliasson: Thinking if i can use latching switch in spiny throttle to have high mode and lov mode on adc v2 adapter?
[2022-09-26T13:25:51] Oliver Eliasson: <photos/photo_6286@26-09-2022_13-25-51.jpg>
[2022-09-26T13:26:49] Oliver Eliasson: Something like that, when presssed its in high mode and full throttle is full. When unpressed its in medium and can set that to about 50% full throttle
[2022-09-26T13:51:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I think no way for that
[2022-09-26T13:52:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Not possible together
[2022-09-26T13:52:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Adc2 plays with virtual limits of throttle
[2022-09-26T13:53:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So imagine if 1 is normal speed
[2022-09-26T13:53:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Second already some way pushing it
[2022-09-26T13:54:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Better do different profile
[2022-09-26T13:56:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Near this i find Spin Y pretty cool, I was worried how it will work But its like charm Deadzone is good also After a bit of usage i got use to it
[2022-09-26T13:59:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Not sure how to describe this but its Really easy to dose throttle with it
[2022-09-26T14:00:25] Oliver Eliasson: No 1 is slow speed, high i normal speed and medium you can set lower. So highpower is regualar throttle and medium full throttle outputs 50 to vesc
[2022-09-26T14:01:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also cc works great Pretty easy to activate If you add more gas It will keep higher speed On a bad terrain it really makes your life easier
[2022-09-26T14:01:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You dont understand what i say
[2022-09-26T14:04:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But in short If you have spin y Than you cant have gears like that with a switch
[2022-09-26T14:05:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Coz adc plays it while you have center throttle
[2022-09-26T14:05:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Basically what happens when you have 1-2 or 1-2-3 is adc cheats throttle virtual lvls
[2022-09-26T14:06:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So 3 speed from zero to maximum all power
[2022-09-26T14:06:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: 1 and 2 is what you set While throttle still works full route
[2022-09-26T14:06:52] Oliver Eliasson: You can but with diffrent conection, use hall for regualar esc on adc v2 and regen. Not bi direction wire
[2022-09-26T14:06:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But adc lets like 1/3 power on full throttle work range
[2022-09-26T14:07:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: With spin y you are throttle and brake with regen by adc 1 port üòè
[2022-09-26T14:08:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Did you tried
[2022-09-26T14:08:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Do you have spin y? Also
[2022-09-26T14:08:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: ?
[2022-09-26T14:08:37] Oliver Eliasson: Have not tried yet but spindtend said it will work and have in thier manual
[2022-09-26T14:08:41] Oliver Eliasson: Yes have two
[2022-09-26T14:08:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Coz we did and have both
[2022-09-26T14:08:48] Oliver Eliasson: <photos/photo_6287@26-09-2022_14-08-48.jpg>
[2022-09-26T14:08:51] Oliver Eliasson: <photos/photo_6288@26-09-2022_14-08-51.jpg>
[2022-09-26T14:08:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Manual is crap
[2022-09-26T14:09:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: There own shitty light switch wont work properly
[2022-09-26T14:09:26] Oliver Eliasson: Will try this week maybe if i have time
[2022-09-26T14:09:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also
[2022-09-26T14:09:35] Oliver Eliasson: But regarding the switch
[2022-09-26T14:09:54] Oliver Eliasson: Is it like that? Shorted in one positon and not in middle
[2022-09-26T14:12:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: This had nothing to do with the swich ,it has how center works
[2022-09-26T14:13:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: The two things speak different languages lets say
[2022-09-26T14:14:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: @SirGeoff maybe can explain you better if he has time
[2022-09-26T14:15:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But to tell all about what we experienced with spin y
[2022-09-26T14:16:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I tried to run into a pothole Was interested what will happen Will i add more gas I will brake Or?
[2022-09-26T14:16:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Turned out finger jumped off throttle so nothing bad
[2022-09-26T14:17:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And to say some negative üòÖ
[2022-09-26T14:20:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Wiring was short for me, From throttle to contoller and adc2 final position i was missing like 30 cm , but it didn't count coz was made differently

[2022-09-26T14:23:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Diameter should be bigger like 1 cm or more
[2022-09-26T14:28:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Near this, i can say its super comfy to use,soon as you get familar you fall in love in a way
[2022-09-26T14:30:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also there was 3 ppl trying near me who scoots a lot , all loved it
[2022-09-26T14:42:10] Oliver Eliasson: I know, have janky setup now with same wheel. Spintend remote with zip tiesüòÖ
[2022-09-26T14:45:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Be safe mate üòÅ
[2022-09-26T14:46:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Is that a Brake lever mount near it ,that ring i mean Just we dont see the rest
[2022-09-26T14:46:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Atleast i hope its thatüôà
[2022-09-26T21:18:46] S1m 0n: Maybe it's a silly question: But I can install vesc next to my orginal controller? I am concerned about the display... I thought I connect both controllers on the HALL cable to ground. Positive there is from vesc and the remaining 3 signal outputs I split between both controllers. Then I drive practically via vesc and the original controller transmits only the speed to the orginal display (at least in theory, because when pushing the speed is also displayed when the 3 phases are not connected).
[2022-09-26T21:21:16] Face de Pin Suc√©: Hello, does someone here interested with 2 75100 flipsky V2 not aluminum PCB, never drove on road ? (one is still on his way to me, other, did some tests on table) ?
[2022-09-26T22:15:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Sounds silly,but what contoller or Scoot you talk About
[2022-09-26T22:17:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Honestly you can be only sure if its true v2 if you open the box and check the back ,there is a mix version
[2022-09-26T22:21:35] sombre_enfant: Ye u can
[2022-09-26T22:21:58] sombre_enfant: Gabriel was doing it with xiaomi board
[2022-09-26T22:22:47] Mirono escooters: Price
[2022-09-26T22:27:43] S1m 0n: Kaabo Mantis 10 The controller only requires to be connected to the Hall sensors. Light, phases, brake unplugged, does not interest him and makes no errors
[2022-09-26T22:28:22] Mirono escooters: Nice
[2022-09-26T22:28:28] Mirono escooters: Good Idea

[2022-09-27T07:18:30] Stan: make the wheel bigger please in gloves it‚Äôs hard to scroll but otherwise it‚Äôs a awesome throttle
[2022-09-27T08:35:18] S1m 0n: Do you really believe in this if all scooters were given the same setup ? ü§™ Or in other words: how much do you have to rebuild the Ninebot so that it can first keep up with the other scooters ü§î
[2022-09-27T12:44:40] Jan: Delta mod to hit 30mph Complete rebuild to hit 75+mph
[2022-09-27T12:45:00] Jan: Thats why it was labeled G30 (20s)
[2022-09-27T12:47:34] S1m 0n: Yes I know. but that's futile en about the same as comparing a high-bred Golf versus a launch Mercedes
[2022-09-27T12:50:43] S1m 0n: as the saying goes "don't trust any statistics you haven't falsified yourself" (No front) üòò
[2022-09-27T12:52:12] Jan: ESG is for sure a sponsored content but it would make no sense to have random modified test data for certain products. I think they did the best they could to test real world range/topspeed/accel.
[2022-09-27T12:53:22] S1m 0n: no, that was not related to the delta mod. only on the "statistics" of rocheee üëç
[2022-09-27T13:07:19] S1m 0n: Is the Delta Mod only done on the Ninebot motor ? Or is it also applied to other motors in combination with the Ninbot controller ?
[2022-09-27T13:07:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: Any motor
[2022-09-27T13:12:24] S1m 0n: But a Ninebot controller is always needed as long as you don't have your own solution for a Star-delta starter ?
[2022-09-27T13:33:55] Mirono escooters: Nop
[2022-09-27T13:34:01] Mirono escooters: Ninebot controller nothing to do w it

[2022-09-27T22:47:45] Artem Bulashev: This guy polished alum pcb to be perfectly flat and than applied thermal paste and mounted it onto 10mm front. 300a phase setting, 100a batte try setting, 450a absolute setting All on 75300a FW and temps are 42c maximum!
[2022-09-27T22:49:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: Xd no
[2022-09-27T22:49:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: The 453A current was from 2 vesc
[2022-09-27T22:52:41] Artem Bulashev: Vesc stat report is from one controller
[2022-09-27T22:52:55] Artem Bulashev: 454a peak
[2022-09-27T22:53:30] Artem Bulashev: Seems correct considering absolut 450 - which is the setting for peak limiting
[2022-09-27T22:53:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: No, it‚Äôs from both vesc
[2022-09-27T22:54:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: I asked directly to vedder, vesc main developer
[2022-09-27T22:54:57] Artem Bulashev: So how do we know which parameter it shows per vesc and which from both?
[2022-09-27T22:55:06] Artem Bulashev: That is stupid that there is no indication
[2022-09-27T22:55:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes is badly developed at that point
[2022-09-27T22:55:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: Otherwise our vesc is good
[2022-09-27T22:55:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: 500A and 36¬∞CüòÇ
[2022-09-27T22:56:08] Jan: Lol
[2022-09-27T22:56:25] Artem Bulashev: Which one is that?
[2022-09-27T22:56:44] Artem Bulashev: Vesc outside ?
[2022-09-27T22:57:07] Konstantin: If from both, speed was be a same, but not.
[2022-09-27T22:57:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: Custom
[2022-09-27T22:57:43] Artem Bulashev: If Vader said than what is there to argue?
[2022-09-27T22:57:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ask your self to vedder
[2022-09-27T22:58:07] Artem Bulashev: He is vesc creater
[2022-09-27T22:58:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: You can know this with log
[2022-09-27T22:59:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: Main vesc current - second vesc current = single esc current of main
[2022-09-27T23:11:22] Jan: That would be a cool last name lol
[2022-09-27T23:11:41] Jan: <animation>
[2022-09-27T23:11:58] Artem Bulashev: Those won‚Äôt match exactly either
[2022-09-27T23:12:24] Artem Bulashev: Due to calculation error
[2022-09-27T23:12:29] Artem Bulashev: I know they normally don‚Äôt
[2022-09-27T23:12:43] Artem Bulashev: Tried to figure it that way too
[2022-09-27T23:17:23] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Different tab
[2022-09-27T23:17:59] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: There is second window where Ibatt and there current per one esc

[2022-09-28T02:09:53] Artem Bulashev: This is different
[2022-09-28T02:09:58] Artem Bulashev: This is live monitor - shows what you use at this moment
[2022-09-28T02:10:41] Artem Bulashev: That is result since last power up - how many km, what was max during that time, what was average
[2022-09-28T03:24:21] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ok. Ye, here are current summed from both esc
[2022-09-28T15:11:53] Mirko Boni: Good morning everyone and good afternoon! I have a curiosity, but does vesc tool on my smartphone save mileage data like other apps do? Is there an archive where I can find the routes?

[2022-09-28T22:07:23] rosheee: maybe if i put rion motors on g30 then more fuckeria than slack topspeed
[2022-09-28T22:07:39] rosheee: but happy with g30 we build not the fastest top speed but 0-100
[2022-09-28T22:07:59] S1m 0n: Coz look not to big, for the city by bus, tram or train
[2022-09-28T22:08:12] rosheee: if happy then nice

[2022-09-28T22:09:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: Then 920R is dedicated to track circuit only
[2022-09-28T22:09:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: No offroad

[2022-09-28T22:44:28] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes something like that x)

[2022-09-29T13:33:18] Artem Bulashev: Finally custom order lamp is done and produced
[2022-09-29T13:35:07] Artem Bulashev: Customization was to make it White Low + White High
[2022-09-29T13:35:07] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6304@29-09-2022_13-35-07.jpg>
[2022-09-29T13:35:50] Artem Bulashev: This supposed to be 60w lamps 9-80v
[2022-09-29T13:39:44] Mirono escooters: ü•µ how much it costed
[2022-09-29T13:42:44] Artem Bulashev: 43‚Ç¨
[2022-09-29T13:42:47] Artem Bulashev: üôÉüôÉ
[2022-09-29T13:42:56] Artem Bulashev: Incl shipping
[2022-09-29T13:43:30] Mirono escooters: Damn
[2022-09-29T13:43:38] Mirono escooters: Really 60w tho?
[2022-09-29T13:45:53] gil guy: A link?
[2022-09-29T13:49:50] Artem Bulashev: Waiting for public link
[2022-09-29T13:50:04] Artem Bulashev: Supposedly yeah
[2022-09-29T13:50:11] Artem Bulashev: But we all know China, in many years I found only two lights on Aliexpress that did correct Watts - 16w and 20w
[2022-09-29T13:52:25] Artem Bulashev: If this one can do 20w +20w this will be MORE than enough for midnight rides without need for 2-3 lights installation that Looks stupid as hell Honestly true 18w Low+High together lamps was enough for me to ride at night. 30w would be crazy a lot of light, 40w ? üòÉ Damm. 60w too much likely even
[2022-09-29T13:56:38] Artem Bulashev: For me most important is beam pattern, from 5m, you get 8m wide, 5m high when Low + High (Unlike 99% of lamps are like 0.5m hight of the light beam üòÑ)
[2022-09-29T14:01:31] S1m 0n: I can't find any better information about mine and twice the price. I'm also very happy with it, but in the depths of darkness (without street lighting, etc.) this shadow bothers me
[2022-09-29T14:02:24] Artem Bulashev: What is that light? How high from the flor is it ?
[2022-09-29T14:02:52] Artem Bulashev: Your photo?
[2022-09-29T14:02:56] S1m 0n: No
[2022-09-29T14:03:04] S1m 0n: From manufacturer
[2022-09-29T14:03:19] S1m 0n: <photos/photo_6307@29-09-2022_14-03-19.jpg>
[2022-09-29T14:03:45] S1m 0n: It's call IQ-X E ‚Üê importend is the E for E-Bike
[2022-09-29T14:04:01] Artem Bulashev: 199‚Ç¨
[2022-09-29T14:04:04] Artem Bulashev: Auch

[2022-09-29T14:04:58] S1m 0n: It's not my one

[2022-09-29T14:05:34] Artem Bulashev: On your photo it says ixon space that‚Äôs why I checked
[2022-09-29T14:06:06] Artem Bulashev: Well I should get mine in 2 weeks
[2022-09-29T14:06:17] Artem Bulashev: Will see how 43‚Ç¨ lamps can do
[2022-09-29T14:06:34] Artem Bulashev: But it is best (all in one) that I can find to date based on manufacturer data
[2022-09-29T14:06:55] S1m 0n: Same picture
[2022-09-29T14:07:24] S1m 0n: But it's also wrong on amazon the call 6-60V
[2022-09-29T14:07:30] S1m 0n: Don't know üòÇ
[2022-09-29T14:07:47] Artem Bulashev: Also tiny ass lamp without cooling fins or anything like that
[2022-09-29T14:07:55] Artem Bulashev: How many watts it pulls?
[2022-09-29T14:08:13] S1m 0n: Never test it ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2022-09-29T14:08:32] Artem Bulashev: Can you point it straight at the wall from 5m and take photo please ?
[2022-09-29T14:08:53] S1m 0n: I can do it in tonight
[2022-09-29T14:09:25] Artem Bulashev: Thanks! May be put something to reference like 1M tape meter
[2022-09-29T14:25:40] Artem Bulashev: Found more info!
[2022-09-29T14:26:26] Artem Bulashev: Low beam 40w, high beam 20w. Together 55-60w real life. A pair such draws 115-120w with low+high!
[2022-09-29T14:27:08] Mirono escooters: I have 1 100w led diode at home It lights up my whole garden w 120* beam lens lol
[2022-09-29T14:27:18] Artem Bulashev: 9-80v dc dc comes as such on the cable
[2022-09-29T14:27:46] Artem Bulashev: So this 60w should be f a lot and enough to be the only lamp needed üëçüëç
[2022-09-29T14:27:54] Mirono escooters: Very fun toy
[2022-09-29T14:28:01] Mirono escooters: Lol more then enough

[2022-09-29T14:28:22] Mirono escooters: Just weird if i see how much my 100w needs cooling wise To believe theirs is that high
[2022-09-29T14:28:45] Mirono escooters: The radiator is big and a fan, and still alittle hot
[2022-09-29T14:28:46] S1m 0n: makes a lot of friends at night if set too high angel
[2022-09-29T14:29:12] Mirono escooters: I got my normal small led and fog lamps wich i turn on off, when cars come i toggle off
[2022-09-29T14:32:01] Artem Bulashev: 40w low beam sounds awesome, double of what I had is commonly what people use any way, dual lamp from aliexpress is 32-35w But + 20w high beam , that sounds ideal frankly speaking, should be putting good lumens on the road
[2022-09-29T18:13:23] S1m 0n: unfortunately not an issue for me. no street legal in Germany.. how else should it beü§£

[2022-09-29T22:01:42] S1m 0n: how often should it be renewed? and how? first pull out the old one or just put the new one over it?

[2022-09-29T22:15:51] S1m 0n: So I found to diffrents cheap ferrorfluid.. one water based, the oder oilbased
[2022-09-29T22:16:00] S1m 0n: I think oilbased is better?
[2022-09-29T22:22:53] Mirono escooters: Waterbased? No
[2022-09-29T22:26:48] S1m 0n: Ferrofluid can dry out after some time. The durability depends on various factors. The carrier liquid of our ferrofluid M-FER-10 evaporates if the liquid is in the air for too long. This process is highly temperature dependent. At room temperature, the concentration changes within a few months. This influences the distribution of the iron particles in the carrier liquid and leads to partial sedimentation, i.e. to the settling of the iron particles. However, if the ferrofluid is stored in a sealed glass container, it can have a shelf life of up to ten years.
[2022-09-29T22:27:06] rosheee: ^^' still not dried out
[2022-09-29T22:27:31] Mirono escooters: Same here

[2022-10-01T18:55:01] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I use it (8502) on my ferry 72v, already 3 years passed, all is ok
[2022-10-01T18:55:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Max voltage i have is around 82.5-83v
[2022-10-01T19:05:15] Mirono escooters: 8502 is fine..
[2022-10-01T19:08:56] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: It will be fine if you dont go stupid with charging to 4.2-4.25 per cells. As not serious companies do. I have a personal rule for dont go above 4.15-4.17v max charge per cell. Never had problems
[2022-10-01T19:16:45] Mirono escooters: Same
[2022-10-01T20:14:29] sombre_enfant: U need to clean as soon as it get to water

[2022-10-01T21:08:38] rosheee: Bah xD
[2022-10-01T21:09:33] rosheee: I msybe do the other 3 phase connectors Then connect throttle Throttle to both escs? Or only adc to 2nd esc?
[2022-10-01T21:45:40] Luis Magalhaes: Throttle you have to connect 5v from one of the controllers, signal to both in parallel and negative to both in parallel
[2022-10-01T22:35:54] rosheee: XD tomorrow
[2022-10-01T23:12:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What you mean by filtering?

[2022-10-01T23:42:11] Luis Magalhaes: Normally with the "plus" version is minimotors
[2022-10-01T23:43:00] Luis Magalhaes: On the new Gt you have sinewave or minimotors, @roscheeee buy his with crappy minimotors üòÇ

[2022-10-02T00:19:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: most escooter cabling are awful üòÖ
[2022-10-02T00:41:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So true,but some beats the other in craparia,like kugoo style All cables same color ,same plugs üòÜüòÖ

[2022-10-02T11:19:47] Mirono escooters: Huh
[2022-10-02T15:55:55] Oliver Eliasson: Is there a way to calibrate tempsensor in vesc app?
[2022-10-02T16:27:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Thermal throttle you mean?
[2022-10-02T17:55:47] Artem Bulashev: Interesting :) but isolated, for lights should be ok
[2022-10-02T17:56:02] Artem Bulashev: 8amps is great
[2022-10-02T17:56:24] Mirono escooters: Real amps tho
[2022-10-02T17:57:03] Artem Bulashev: Hmm 110 X 70mm x 23mm in the case
[2022-10-02T17:57:10] Artem Bulashev: That ubox dual size üòÅüòÅ
[2022-10-02T17:57:28] Artem Bulashev: Wonder how big ubox 3a dc-dc than ‚Ä¶
[2022-10-02T19:54:11] rosheee: @Mirono_escooters
[2022-10-02T19:56:48] Mirono escooters: Hows that me
[2022-10-02T20:44:54] Oliver Eliasson: My temp sensor displays wrong temperature. Maybe 50% to much (in 22C¬∞ room it displays 35C¬∞)
[2022-10-02T20:45:32] Oliver Eliasson: Is there a way to tell it now it is 22C¬∞ and then same at 100 in boiling water?
[2022-10-02T20:45:55] Oliver Eliasson: Ubox dual 75v
[2022-10-02T20:46:08] Oliver Eliasson: 100k ntc sensor
[2022-10-02T20:47:16] Oliver Eliasson: Yeah but if possible to calibrate then good, nice if not needed to switch
[2022-10-02T20:54:37] Artem Bulashev: Dip it into well boiling water and see what it shows should be 100 degrees Celsius (-1 degree if you live at 1000m above see level, -2 degree at 2000m, linear relation)
[2022-10-02T20:56:08] Artem Bulashev: Yes connected to vesc
[2022-10-02T20:56:23] Artem Bulashev: Just plug in same sensor (spare one)
[2022-10-02T20:56:28] Artem Bulashev: No need to dismount wheel
[2022-10-02T20:57:16] Artem Bulashev: It is just put a cattle to boil near scooter and boil it few times (on second time put sensor in)
[2022-10-02T20:57:29] Artem Bulashev: It is 100degrer exactly when it is fully boiling
[2022-10-02T20:57:47] Artem Bulashev: Hah :) preaty easy if you have cattle
[2022-10-02T20:58:03] Artem Bulashev: With a pot and gas stove I would not haha put escooter above stove
[2022-10-02T20:58:51] Artem Bulashev: Why?
[2022-10-02T20:58:57] Artem Bulashev: Unplug on vesc side
[2022-10-02T20:59:02] Artem Bulashev: And plug in new sensor
[2022-10-02T20:59:13] Artem Bulashev: Oh you don‚Äôt have spare
[2022-10-02T20:59:39] Artem Bulashev: Temp
[2022-10-02T20:59:54] Artem Bulashev: I have same one ? Don‚Äôt think so
[2022-10-02T21:00:32] Artem Bulashev: Only need temp sensor (activate live monitor in vesc tool and you will see live reading
[2022-10-02T21:00:52] Oliver Eliasson: Tip, cat 6 cable perfect fit for button module for spiny throttle
[2022-10-02T21:01:08] Artem Bulashev: Ferrofluid you guys still have but temp sensor I got since long ago of my own
[2022-10-02T21:01:46] Artem Bulashev: Nice üòÅ I was shocked they ship it unassembled
[2022-10-02T21:02:00] Artem Bulashev: In theory
[2022-10-02T21:02:15] Artem Bulashev: But best to check at 100c any way because that is what matters
[2022-10-02T21:02:35] Oliver Eliasson: Will do tomorrow maybe
[2022-10-02T21:03:45] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-10-02T21:03:58] Artem Bulashev: Yes differently
[2022-10-02T21:04:11] Artem Bulashev: I‚Äôm working on custom remapping of throttle curve
[2022-10-02T21:04:22] Artem Bulashev: Luckily MCU can handle such task
[2022-10-02T21:04:56] Artem Bulashev: Right now it is exponential
[2022-10-02T21:05:01] Artem Bulashev: Due to physics
[2022-10-02T21:05:47] rosheee: @artBula would it be possible to get more way @ spinny?
[2022-10-02T21:05:51] rosheee: left and right
[2022-10-02T21:05:56] Artem Bulashev: Magnet doesn‚Äôt appliance sensor linearly - distance along circumference is not constantly 1 to 1 to direct distance between magnet and sensor
[2022-10-02T21:06:03] Artem Bulashev: It is exponential
[2022-10-02T21:06:34] Artem Bulashev: Yes I think later this year
[2022-10-02T21:07:19] Artem Bulashev: Fist objective batch 2 refinement
[2022-10-02T21:07:34] Artem Bulashev: Even on 9+ is not good
[2022-10-02T21:08:44] Artem Bulashev: A lot of space on low speed 1-5 I‚Äôm than ok but fast changes on 5-20kmh and than super sharp changes 20-40kmh
[2022-10-02T21:09:01] Artem Bulashev: Instead of linear
[2022-10-02T21:09:25] Artem Bulashev: Also found calibration not friendly
[2022-10-02T21:09:39] Artem Bulashev: Changing it to be selective by 0.05 steps
[2022-10-02T21:10:32] Artem Bulashev: This will make it easier. Got close, than tap one for one step up, wheel jerks on its own than simple hold 1 sec to go one step down
[2022-10-02T21:10:48] Artem Bulashev: Yeah no need on vesc
[2022-10-02T21:11:26] Artem Bulashev: Through you can calibrate travel (first calibration in manual) - it will calibrate center point.
[2022-10-02T21:12:02] Artem Bulashev: One more change will be cruise button actually will work internally - as i intended but Spintend didn‚Äôt understand and so left it out of batch 1 FW code
[2022-10-02T21:12:56] Artem Bulashev: Lost of changes and improvements - also red wheel rubs bottom case, so I changed tolerance there
[2022-10-02T21:13:21] Oliver Eliasson: Thats why it does not work for me
[2022-10-02T21:13:24] Artem Bulashev: Silver is ok but will be better too
[2022-10-02T21:13:29] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-10-02T21:13:56] Oliver Eliasson: How do i connect it for it to work?
[2022-10-02T21:14:03] Oliver Eliasson: I use adc v2 adapter
[2022-10-02T21:14:03] Artem Bulashev: Got to run now, have a good one guys ü§ó
[2022-10-02T21:14:28] Artem Bulashev: I don‚Äôt know on adapter - if it has input for cruise than it is possible
[2022-10-02T21:14:42] Oliver Eliasson: It hase but two ports
[2022-10-02T21:14:55] Oliver Eliasson: Back button only one cable
[2022-10-02T21:15:06] Artem Bulashev: It was meant to be internal - fw code is missing. External wire was to be used as ‚Äúgeneric button‚Äù for what ever you want like horn
[2022-10-02T21:15:09] rosheee: better
[2022-10-02T21:15:12] Oliver Eliasson: Do i split ground cable?
[2022-10-02T21:15:22] Artem Bulashev: Think so
[2022-10-02T21:15:22] rosheee: also the quality of the wheel could teh pls be better xD
[2022-10-02T21:15:28] Artem Bulashev: But ground should be common
[2022-10-02T21:15:29] Oliver Eliasson: Yes
[2022-10-02T21:15:31] Artem Bulashev: So no need
[2022-10-02T21:15:42] Oliver Eliasson: Will try more tommorow
[2022-10-02T21:15:47] Artem Bulashev: Of metal / cnc?
[2022-10-02T21:16:06] rosheee: no not that the mechanics
[2022-10-02T21:16:10] Artem Bulashev: I thought quality it self is good, just design flawed
[2022-10-02T21:16:14] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-10-02T21:16:21] Artem Bulashev: Fixed it already
[2022-10-02T21:16:21] rosheee: when u push it a bit up then it blocks
[2022-10-02T21:16:23] rosheee: ah lol
[2022-10-02T21:16:29] rosheee: XD BUT JAN's not
[2022-10-02T21:16:47] Artem Bulashev: Only matter of the creating the curve now- fw is being finished this week hopefully
[2022-10-02T21:17:08] Artem Bulashev: Yeah it rubs over the lower case - you have red one?
[2022-10-02T21:17:12] rosheee: i have no one
[2022-10-02T21:17:16] rosheee: but jan has the black one
[2022-10-02T21:17:19] rosheee: that made me sad
[2022-10-02T21:17:27] Artem Bulashev: Wheel red or silver?
[2022-10-02T21:17:37] rosheee: @AJAJ1992
[2022-10-02T21:17:46] rosheee: silver if i remember correctly
[2022-10-02T21:18:29] Artem Bulashev: Ok, new design has better tolerance on wheel mount so it won‚Äôt tilt and touch the case
[2022-10-02T21:18:46] Artem Bulashev: And case is 0.2mm lower - so won‚Äôt be possible to touch by wheel on batch 2
[2022-10-02T21:19:10] Artem Bulashev: Was 0.16mm now 0.36mm gap between wheel and lower case
[2022-10-02T21:19:14] rosheee: i don't use spinny
[2022-10-02T21:19:18] rosheee: i use ^^' the sharkset
[2022-10-02T21:19:28] rosheee: with +20% and natural @ 16s
[2022-10-02T21:19:34] rosheee: or +30% now
[2022-10-02T21:19:40] rosheee: and 20S i use +15%
[2022-10-02T21:19:42] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I use on vsett9 stock and it‚Äôs ok but would not use on anything above likely
[2022-10-02T21:21:20] Jan: Its the crap stock controller that have no usable throttle curve
[2022-10-02T21:21:40] Artem Bulashev: Oh on vesc May be better
[2022-10-02T21:21:42] Jan: Vsett10+ on lvl5 accel. Press 1mm and its full throttle
[2022-10-02T21:21:58] Artem Bulashev: On stock controller vsett it‚Äôs ok but not sure on 9+ how it would be on stock
[2022-10-02T21:22:03] Jan: 21kW vesc i can drive around pedestrians 3-7kmh all day
[2022-10-02T21:22:38] Artem Bulashev: Prob not :)
[2022-10-02T21:25:45] Ofek üê•: Looks good! Is the core single or multi strand wire?
[2022-10-02T21:26:37] rosheee: <photos/photo_6361@02-10-2022_21-26-37.jpg>
[2022-10-03T00:17:55] Artem Bulashev: What ever is opposite of exponential over X
[2022-10-03T00:18:26] Artem Bulashev: Meath dictates it would be logarithmic curve
[2022-10-03T00:18:48] Jan: No didnt try it yet. I have it on my desk since august
[2022-10-03T00:21:04] Jan: But 21kW with that short travel on spin-y is critical for me. Wish i could change the zero point. Now its center for accel/e-brake but i dont use e brake so half of necessary throttle zone is unusable. What are the plans for the future? @artBula
[2022-10-03T00:21:13] Artem Bulashev: Basically due to physics throttle curve is green (ignore numbers) If I make throttle curve that is logarithmic (blue), result will be linear response (red)
[2022-10-03T00:22:16] Jan: I dont think i would want linear with high power scooter
[2022-10-03T00:22:48] Jan: 100-300W i need lots of fine control but 8-20kW it doesnt matter as the wheel spin anyway ü§∑
[2022-10-03T00:23:20] Mirono escooters: Agree. Love quadratic
[2022-10-03T00:23:34] Artem Bulashev: Thing is that if you start slow, you need some where to catch up, to than get to max
[2022-10-03T00:23:56] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2022-10-03T00:24:06] Artem Bulashev: I see
[2022-10-03T00:24:40] Mirono escooters: In Xiaomi quadratic is e^x
[2022-10-03T00:24:46] Mirono escooters: +-
[2022-10-03T00:25:14] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6363@03-10-2022_00-25-14.jpg>
[2022-10-03T00:25:18] Mirono escooters: Just good to have low power precision control, like in city And when u wanna go Vroom u go vroom
[2022-10-03T00:25:33] Artem Bulashev: Ok will target that
[2022-10-03T00:25:35] Artem Bulashev: I agree
[2022-10-03T00:26:24] Artem Bulashev: Right now it is like this
[2022-10-03T00:26:38] Artem Bulashev: Too much üòÑ
[2022-10-03T00:28:58] Jan: Quadratic is x^2 Exponential is a^x (here a=e~2.72)
[2022-10-03T00:29:21] Mirono escooters: Yea i know, its just some stupid incorrect name that kept hanging
[2022-10-03T00:29:43] Mirono escooters: Aka Russian power control (don't ask whyü§∑)
[2022-10-03T00:32:17] Artem Bulashev: E^—Ö is exponential
[2022-10-03T00:32:23] Artem Bulashev: Not quadratic
[2022-10-03T00:32:33] Mirono escooters: I know
[2022-10-03T00:32:36] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2022-10-03T00:32:39] Mirono escooters: The name is inaccurate :)
[2022-10-03T00:32:45] Artem Bulashev: But I get what you mean
[2022-10-03T00:32:53] Mirono escooters: Idk who named it. But i mean, the feature is called that
[2022-10-03T00:32:55] Artem Bulashev: Slower but not totally flat at the low
[2022-10-03T00:32:58] Mirono escooters: Guess it sounded cooler
[2022-10-03T00:33:16] Artem Bulashev: Exponential doesn‚Äôt sound like good idea
[2022-10-03T00:33:31] Mirono escooters: To the average stock Xiaomi modderü§∑
[2022-10-03T02:59:46] rosheee: I lnow
[2022-10-03T02:59:58] rosheee: Depends on battery and boost u want
[2022-10-03T03:00:11] rosheee: Also on whole setup
[2022-10-03T03:05:59] rosheee: Not for spinny
[2022-10-03T03:06:44] rosheee: But i have my 13S, 16S, 17S and 20S fuckeria curves besides other custom settings incl. PID
[2022-10-03T08:14:05] Jan: Second one is done

[2022-10-03T09:07:03] Jan: Focer Vesc works perfectly üëå
[2022-10-03T09:15:41] Federico77: Wow really interesting, obviously dissipated with your system with platform etc etc
[2022-10-03T09:22:15] Federico77: Alternative https://customwheel.shop/de/high-voltage-vesc-based-speed-controllers/little-focer-v31-esc-84v-20s-chassispanel-mount
[2022-10-03T09:27:12] Jan: Thats the one installed üëå
[2022-10-03T09:27:20] Jan: 2x
[2022-10-03T09:28:13] Jan: 21.8kW peak
[2022-10-03T09:54:28] Federico77: I saved your message, when you posted the link, it seems to me it is very well dissipated by firing mosfets and Capacitor from opposite sides
[2022-10-03T10:51:31] Jan: Our first test with exact setup confirms that
[2022-10-03T10:52:02] Jan: Tronic removed individual mosfet temp sensors, did a worse soldering job overall
[2022-10-03T11:07:23] Jan: It is big time
[2022-10-03T11:08:44] Jan: - empty promises - poor quality of parts - years delay of customers order (some people deposited 10k$ and never got their order) - scamming other companies (kelly for example) - unprofessional behavior of the CEO in many examples
[2022-10-03T11:08:58] Jan: Its just pcb
[2022-10-03T11:09:16] Jan: Mounted it directly on the floor
[2022-10-03T11:09:35] rosheee: there is no stock cooling
[2022-10-03T11:09:36] rosheee: XD
[2022-10-03T11:10:10] rosheee: how else u wanna cool?
[2022-10-03T11:10:56] rosheee: customwheel.shop
[2022-10-03T11:10:58] rosheee: there u can see
[2022-10-03T11:11:03] rosheee: the case is brand new
[2022-10-03T11:38:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: They pushed up price again
[2022-10-03T11:38:16] rosheee: it was 300 euro
[2022-10-03T11:38:19] rosheee: now 340euro
[2022-10-03T11:39:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: Xd
[2022-10-03T11:39:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: Was 280
[2022-10-03T11:39:50] S1m 0n: does anyone know what happened on Aliexpress with the "merge delivery"? somehow it doesn't appear to me anymore
[2022-10-03T11:42:25] Mirono escooters: ü§î no problems for me
[2022-10-03T11:42:30] Mirono escooters: Maybe Germany
[2022-10-03T11:42:41] Mirono escooters: Packages real slow tho.. your bms not moving
[2022-10-03T11:43:02] Jan: 265.64‚Ç¨
[2022-10-03T11:43:14] rosheee: ah sry XD
[2022-10-03T11:43:17] rosheee: HAD SOMETHING ELSE IN MIND
[2022-10-03T11:44:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes because you see the price without vat
[2022-10-03T11:44:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: Vat will applied at Switzerland custom I thought
[2022-10-03T11:47:15] Unknown: <video_file>
[2022-10-03T11:47:37] Unknown: Bearings?
[2022-10-03T11:55:00] Jan: 8%
[2022-10-03T11:55:40] Jan: ~ 290‚Ç¨ end price
[2022-10-03T11:57:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: Price is easy for Swiss workers ü´£
[2022-10-03T15:33:28] T·ëå·ñá·ó∑O·îï·ó©·îï·ëï·ïº: Is there a way, that i can use the iOS VESC Tool with the 6.0 version?
[2022-10-03T15:33:57] Mirono escooters: 8% only??
[2022-10-03T15:34:03] Mirono escooters: 21% be go brrrrr
[2022-10-03T15:38:28] Federico77: <photos/photo_6367@03-10-2022_15-38-28.jpg>
[2022-10-03T18:03:50] Artem Bulashev: Yeap and no tax on what is GIFT under 100euro/chf incl shipping cost
[2022-10-03T18:13:59] Artem Bulashev: Looks like new industry standard now Basically identical
[2022-10-03T18:13:59] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6369@03-10-2022_18-13-59.jpg>
[2022-10-03T18:28:38] Oliver Eliasson: Whould it be possible to have two settings? With cruise button being handled by mcu in throttle (Press to hold throttle position). Could it be possible to have two different throttle curves? One linear and one quadratic or exponential (switch by holding cc button for maybe 5 seconds?)
[2022-10-03T20:14:49] Artem Bulashev: I can‚Äôt say if this y will be possible - memory can be the limiting factor
[2022-10-03T20:16:11] Mirono escooters: Prob same factory
[2022-10-03T20:16:56] Artem Bulashev: Think so too
[2022-10-03T20:17:11] Artem Bulashev: Guess that is new qs-s4
[2022-10-03T20:18:13] Artem Bulashev: Wonder if they all will have same protocol cross scooters - that would be good for vesc translator board development
[2022-10-03T20:18:50] Mirono escooters: Ye display looks good
[2022-10-03T20:20:22] S1m 0n: All the display /controllers cums from same factory or same china Kataloge
[2022-10-03T20:20:47] S1m 0n: Frame and Electronic parts different
[2022-10-03T20:21:03] Artem Bulashev: Yeah question which one
[2022-10-03T20:21:11] S1m 0n: Oh yes
[2022-10-03T20:21:32] Artem Bulashev: If we could find we could give them directly an idea to make display with VESC messages readout
[2022-10-03T20:21:38] Artem Bulashev: That would be the best
[2022-10-03T20:21:59] S1m 0n: Looks like a secret
[2022-10-03T20:22:04] Artem Bulashev: And super easy for them to accomplish with nearly 0 cost
[2022-10-03T20:22:39] S1m 0n: Have found many manufacturers on board, but they seem to produce onlythe boards and not the software
[2022-10-03T20:22:52] Artem Bulashev: What board?
[2022-10-03T20:22:58] Artem Bulashev: Inside display?
[2022-10-03T20:23:11] S1m 0n: Controllers, Displays, SmartHubs
[2022-10-03T20:23:15] Artem Bulashev: Oh
[2022-10-03T20:23:15] S1m 0n: Not the new one
[2022-10-03T20:23:16] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2022-10-03T20:23:26] Artem Bulashev: Examples?
[2022-10-03T20:23:38] Artem Bulashev: May be useful
[2022-10-03T20:24:09] S1m 0n: I can check in the next few days.. most things somewhere stored online
[2022-10-03T20:26:08] S1m 0n: I think vsett controllers say "keysang" or something like that. the same can be found with zero controllers.
[2022-10-03T20:32:26] S1m 0n: Not sure maybe this one
[2022-10-03T20:34:31] S1m 0n: Jipin manufacturer (J&P)
[2022-10-03T21:03:11] S1m 0n: https://m.alibaba.com/product/60805864541/detail.html?channel=minisite_a2706.wshop_index.82.i7&otherparams=https%3A%2F%2Fm.alibaba.com%2Fproduct%2F60805864541%2Felectric-bicycle-dc-motor-speed-controller.html&scenery_id=2&tracelog=a2706.wshop_index.82.i7&spm=a2706.wshop_index.82.i7&wx_navbar_transparent=true

[2022-10-03T21:09:53] S1m 0n: The display looks different on the pictures. But you can also find controllers with the tf-100 display
[2022-10-03T21:09:54] S1m 0n: <photos/photo_6372@03-10-2022_21-09-54.jpg>
[2022-10-03T21:10:35] S1m 0n: Similar designations of the soldering points as for kaabo, vsett and Zero
[2022-10-03T22:33:59] Artem Bulashev: I start to think used Android phone for 70‚Ç¨ is the ultimate diplay for vesc üòÖüòÅ
[2022-10-03T22:34:57] Artem Bulashev: Just need to cnc enclosure that would make it non removable and hold usb cable which we connect to 5v üëçüòä
[2022-10-03T22:35:56] Mirono escooters: Yea i got a old gps/vesc phone

[2022-10-03T22:38:35] Artem Bulashev: I know what we are missing. An android FW made for vesc
[2022-10-03T22:40:54] Artem Bulashev: Than we could flash a phone - so that it turns on with power charger - goes directly into monitor of vesc tool - can only be switch over to maps applications / music - secret combo to switch to normal mode so that you can download app you want - load police mode setting from vesc tool up on boot up
[2022-10-03T23:00:36] Mirono escooters: Yesss
[2022-10-03T23:00:42] Mirono escooters: Cant be hard todo
[2022-10-04T07:15:57] S1m 0n: in Germany that might only be possible if you have a nice 3D print that makes the smartphone look like a display üòÅ. but I wouldn't want to have to unscrew the display every time to be able to charge the battery. bruhh USB Micro.
[2022-10-04T10:05:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: main issue with phone os : it takes forever to boot...
[2022-10-04T12:19:31] Artem Bulashev: True - need some sort of deep sleep mode until charger connects with all functions shut almost, so that OS doesn‚Äôt need to boot fully
[2022-10-04T12:21:27] Mirono escooters: 1 minute bootü§∑ doesnt matter
[2022-10-04T12:42:44] S1m 0n: The idea is great, but I'm still not a fan of it. it's easy to take a cfw and create your own rules with root (automatically open vesc app, turn on bluetooth), but what makes it unattractive are all the extra drivers that come with it. be it for mobile communications (I don't think anyone is in the mood for a second SIM card), or all the sensors. even if you don't use it, all the processes still run in the background. vesc should also offer the option of locking the screen
[2022-10-04T12:45:01] S1m 0n: I meant that the screen is on, but does not accept touches (e.g. when it rains)
[2022-10-04T12:46:39] S1m 0n: also, the readability on mobile phones is pretty miserable in direct sunlight. not to mention how the phone likes to bask in the sun for a few hours
[2022-10-04T12:47:34] S1m 0n: I'm sure it will shut down. at least mine does after a few hours in the sun and I already have liquid cooling

[2022-10-04T19:30:35] Jan: Almost done Ninebot G30
[2022-10-04T21:16:46] Luis Magalhaes: Clean look love it üëå
[2022-10-04T21:32:51] Artem Bulashev: Guys!!
[2022-10-04T21:33:41] Artem Bulashev: What do you think of Throttle to be 70 degrees accel and 20 degrees ebrake vs current 45/45 degrees!!
[2022-10-04T21:34:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: 60 30üëç
[2022-10-04T21:35:33] Mirono escooters: Yes, need more precise throttle and use more then ebrake
[2022-10-04T21:35:40] Mirono escooters: 60 30 good
[2022-10-04T21:36:56] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6377@04-10-2022_21-36-56.jpg>
[2022-10-04T21:37:26] Artem Bulashev: I will go try 25degree
[2022-10-04T21:37:27] Mirono escooters: Or can you make it adjustable ü§∑ Screw or something
[2022-10-04T21:37:33] Artem Bulashev: Impossible
[2022-10-04T21:38:04] Artem Bulashev: Design of the arm be stoppers/limiters all ties to that
[2022-10-04T21:38:23] Artem Bulashev: It was extremely hard to change from even 45/45 split
[2022-10-04T21:38:47] Artem Bulashev: I now found the way to do it, but it has to be fixed value
[2022-10-04T21:38:53] Artem Bulashev: I‚Äôm creating group
[2022-10-04T21:39:05] Artem Bulashev: Will add Every one who bought batch 1
[2022-10-04T21:39:46] Artem Bulashev: I tested 70/20 and it is great split, could use 25 on reverse I guess
[2022-10-04T21:43:38] Artem Bulashev: Will collect feed back on the group yeah that is the objective, also don‚Äôt want to flood this chat
[2022-10-04T21:45:35] Oliver Eliasson: Got two questions regarding throttle: for us that got batch one, whould it be possible to install the new fw on old throttle or change the logic board? (Would be nice with cc built in) Is it the arms or the wheel that decides one split it has? 45/45 70/30 etc? If it is the wheel maybe could have options (but maybe to complicated to have to many variants)
[2022-10-04T22:00:57] Artem Bulashev: It‚Äôs everything
[2022-10-04T22:01:40] Artem Bulashev: I just found that with such split even new arm doesn‚Äôt work because of mechanics
[2022-10-04T22:02:16] Artem Bulashev: Need more design changes - may require to change shape of the body even
[2022-10-04T22:02:43] Artem Bulashev: I will try to find a way to archive it with same body
[2022-10-04T22:02:58] Artem Bulashev: So that you guys all can update by easy swapping
[2022-10-04T22:44:12] Mirko Boni: Jan congratulations! It's a work of art üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
[2022-10-05T01:52:37] Artem Bulashev: Oh my f god
[2022-10-05T01:52:41] Artem Bulashev: Managed
[2022-10-05T02:54:47] Artem Bulashev: But 60/30 is ABSOLUTELY maximum I could getü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è a lot than 45/45, I want to have. This requires nothing beside new wheel - which will be required any way because we are gonna switch to new magnet üëç so easy swap to fix 2 major problems
[2022-10-05T10:05:37] Oliver Eliasson: So people with version one could just get new wheel for different travel. New logic board available for swap?
[2022-10-05T10:08:24] Mirono escooters: Thats cool
[2022-10-05T10:15:31] Jan: I will update my spinY when its available and test on G30
[2022-10-05T10:16:52] Jan: That Nami thumb throttle i have now is nice but dead zone is too large and jittering can be an issue
[2022-10-05T10:19:27] S1m 0n: I don't really understand what the Y-spin is for... is that a kind of gas/brake in one or how is that to be understood?
[2022-10-05T10:30:21] Jan: Accel/E-Brake
[2022-10-05T10:30:36] Jan: At the moment 45/45 deg
[2022-10-05T10:30:51] Jan: Changes to 60/30 on its way
[2022-10-05T10:56:27] Artem Bulashev: It‚Äôs amazing feeling to have acceleration and ebrake under one thumb even on ON/OFF type ebrake controllers like vsett. (With variable ebrake like Ninebot/xiaomi/etow and some other it is just beautiful ‚úÖ) On my vsett9 even with ebrake set to 5 it doesn‚Äôt ebreak much, but I end up using mechanical break about 50% less.
[2022-10-05T11:04:31] S1m 0n: sounds interesting. maybe I'll be part of the next version üëç
[2022-10-05T11:05:21] S1m 0n: What kind is the connector? Higo / Julet 3pin? 4pin?
[2022-10-05T11:08:57] Artem Bulashev: None
[2022-10-05T11:09:11] Artem Bulashev: It‚Äôs 7 wires cable
[2022-10-05T11:09:38] Artem Bulashev: People select what they need and add connector or solder to display
[2022-10-05T11:11:44] S1m 0n: why 7? what is the technology behind it? I would have thought there were just 2 Hall sensors in there
[2022-10-05T11:11:49] Artem Bulashev: There are 2 brake wire versions, 2 throttle wire versions, extra wire for cruise button external function (not many people will use it for some thing else but wire is there if you want it to be horn or what ever you put it on)
[2022-10-05T11:12:06] S1m 0n: Ah üëç
[2022-10-05T11:12:36] S1m 0n: is it a push button or a switch?
[2022-10-05T11:12:43] Artem Bulashev: There is one hall. But we have on board MCU that handles signal outputs - which allows it to work on any type of controller
[2022-10-05T11:13:16] Artem Bulashev: Push (momentary) - tap and throttle hold activated, until you spin wheel again
[2022-10-05T11:14:28] S1m 0n: so some technology inside. switch button would be interesting because the light is simply switched on and off with a switch
[2022-10-05T11:15:33] S1m 0n: or could you simply loop through 48V?
[2022-10-05T11:17:15] Artem Bulashev: You could yes
[2022-10-05T11:17:29] Artem Bulashev: If low amps pull - under 25w at 48v = 0.5a should be ok But it would be on than only when you hold button, not sure it‚Äôs ideal for light
[2022-10-05T11:21:56] S1m 0n: no, that would not be comfortable, unless you wanted to have a headlight flasher. toggle mode would be great
[2022-10-05T11:22:37] S1m 0n: But i know makes no sense for horn or cruise controll
[2022-10-05T11:26:07] Artem Bulashev: Not the intended use :) For toggle there is buttons module, that goes on top of throttle and there is one toggle switch üëç
[2022-10-05T11:27:24] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6378@05-10-2022_11-27-24.jpg>
[2022-10-05T11:29:35] S1m 0n: üî•
[2022-10-05T11:59:07] S1m 0n: What's the price for y spin & buttons?
[2022-10-05T12:05:16] S1m 0n: Or no, just the y spin is enough
[2022-10-05T12:08:43] Stan: https://spintend.com/collections/frontpage/products/two-way-throttle-spiny-for-diy-escooter-diy-ebike
[2022-10-05T12:38:35] Artem Bulashev: Retail is 69$, for now it is 59$ as it is early samples. (Plan was only for batch1, but it is still 59$ now even though will be shipping batch 2)
[2022-10-05T12:38:51] Artem Bulashev: But NOT until I have tested it
[2022-10-05T12:46:12] Stan: When will batch 2 be ready? And what is updated ?
[2022-10-05T13:05:26] Artem Bulashev: Good question. Can‚Äôt say now
[2022-10-05T13:05:40] Artem Bulashev: We started manufacturing of the modified parts
[2022-10-05T13:09:27] Artem Bulashev: Ring and lower case already manufactured. Upper case we paused today, because I made very slight changes to allow lever to move freely with 60/30 degree proportion - btw any one who got batch 1 will be able to to use their upper body - just need to cut 0.5mm from plastic lever ‚úÖ (3min job altogether)
[2022-10-05T13:39:56] S1m 0n: So if I order one now I will automatically get batch 2?
[2022-10-05T14:07:32] Artem Bulashev: That is correct, though as I said I can‚Äôt say when it will be ready, this month though
[2022-10-05T14:07:36] Artem Bulashev: 2 weeks likely
[2022-10-05T15:43:15] S1m 0n: nice. and what about water resistance?
[2022-10-05T15:43:49] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-10-05T15:47:49] S1m 0n: is there a way to buy it from you? ‚Öì of the price, just for shipping üòî
[2022-10-05T15:49:04] Mirono escooters: Dont forget taxzs
[2022-10-05T15:49:21] S1m 0n: Fuckinell
[2022-10-05T15:59:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: @artBula ask them to use YunExpress, cheap company and fast. 10$ and 2 week delivery
[2022-10-05T15:59:45] Mirono escooters: Yunexpress slow af for me
[2022-10-05T16:03:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: How much time takes?
[2022-10-05T16:06:00] Mirono escooters: 1 month ü§∑
[2022-10-05T16:06:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: Where are you ?
[2022-10-05T16:07:28] Mirono escooters: North korea
[2022-10-05T16:07:31] Mirono escooters: Belgium.. ,:)
[2022-10-05T16:56:37] Artem Bulashev: It is fully coated with a transparent coating
[2022-10-05T16:57:01] Artem Bulashev: Issue is Belgium
[2022-10-05T16:57:12] Artem Bulashev: Worst National post in EU
[2022-10-05T16:57:27] Artem Bulashev: Get it to Austria with in 7-10 days.
[2022-10-05T17:00:04] Mirono escooters: ;)
[2022-10-05T17:00:26] Mirono escooters: Alot of post for eu gets processed here ü§∑
[2022-10-05T17:00:31] Mirono escooters: And we getting better but still shit
[2022-10-05T17:00:58] Mirono escooters: But not Belgi fault here. Tracking showed super long to here Inside Belgium.. few days .
[2022-10-05T17:01:10] Mirono escooters: Allieexpres usually 1-2 weeks AliExpress max!
[2022-10-05T17:01:14] Mirono escooters: Rather quickly
[2022-10-05T17:04:15] Artem Bulashev: True but even post from and to BE from EU take 3 time longer than from Austria to Spain or Portugal
[2022-10-05T17:08:22] Mirono escooters: ü§∑ alot of work
[2022-10-05T22:41:26] Gigolo Joe: Tips on eliminating front wheel spin without reducing power? Lunch control reduces acceleration, already on pmt tyres. A friend suggested to install a longer stem so I'll be able to move more weight over the handlebars
[2022-10-05T22:41:53] Mirono escooters: Traction control
[2022-10-05T22:42:00] Mirono escooters: Oh shit without reducing power lol
[2022-10-05T22:42:04] Mirono escooters: Batt on pole
[2022-10-05T22:42:13] Mirono escooters: Eat more MacDonald

[2022-10-06T07:06:51] Oliver Eliasson: @artBula did you make a group for throttle?
[2022-10-06T14:47:28] Rogerio Figueiredo: Hello
[2022-10-06T14:48:32] Mirono escooters: Bonjour
[2022-10-06T14:55:13] Rogerio Figueiredo: Thanks for having me here

[2022-10-06T17:26:52] –ê–ª–∫–µ–∫—Å–∏–π: vesc - top!!!
[2022-10-06T18:04:21] Oliver Eliasson: Must have missed it, can you invite me
[2022-10-06T19:45:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What new about it there?
[2022-10-06T19:46:16] Rogerio Figueiredo: Vesc should be stock in a lot of scooter
[2022-10-06T19:46:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well would be nice but will probably never happen
[2022-10-06T19:50:23] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yes
[2022-10-06T19:50:44] Rogerio Figueiredo: I think that is true to go at 25kmh not worth the money
[2022-10-06T19:53:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well , i only gave him here , unsure he readed it or notü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ Throttle works great but i find it small ,if you are in looser gloves, you dont feel it
[2022-10-06T20:18:12] Artem Bulashev: Why would it
[2022-10-06T20:18:17] Artem Bulashev: It can‚Äôt be
[2022-10-06T20:18:31] Artem Bulashev: Economically makes no sense
[2022-10-06T20:18:56] Artem Bulashev: Also performance wise. People MOSTLY use 250-800w scooters
[2022-10-06T20:19:19] Artem Bulashev: Little kick is the most exciting part of it.
[2022-10-06T20:19:24] Artem Bulashev: Fitting vesc will remove it
[2022-10-06T20:19:35] Jan: Vesc is like, 250-800W heat from mosfet üò¨
[2022-10-06T20:19:52] Jan: at 98% efficiency
[2022-10-06T20:20:06] Artem Bulashev: Yeah will be smooth, but other than that no real benefit and def cost more than 25-30$ in cost
[2022-10-06T20:21:09] Jan: Testrun from today, battery at around 75% full
[2022-10-06T20:21:09] Jan: <files/IMG20221004192534.jpg>
[2022-10-06T20:21:19] Jan: <photos/photo_6380@06-10-2022_20-21-19.jpg>
[2022-10-06T20:21:38] Jan: About 12'500W average
[2022-10-06T20:22:15] Artem Bulashev: I have created group and marked like 2 people that popped up as subjected. Group is not ready yet. Will set it up and than share link
[2022-10-06T20:23:46] Rogerio Figueiredo: That is to mutch power
[2022-10-06T20:25:44] Jan: I can hit 0-100kph in about 200meters
[2022-10-06T20:27:01] Jan: The traction control worked a lot better. 7¬∞C increase in mosfet temp during 6x 12.5kW pulls is ok for me
[2022-10-06T20:27:08] Jan: Hubmotors will get warmer anyway
[2022-10-06T20:27:35] Jan: <video_file>
[2022-10-06T20:28:13] Jan: But the traction control feeling is weird af
[2022-10-06T20:29:46] Artem Bulashev: I swear, video looks speed up ü§£ü§£
[2022-10-06T20:31:08] Jan: I need to rebleed the rear brake. Brake power was like 80/20 front causing insane brake wobble when i hit hard from 100-zero
[2022-10-06T20:33:11] Jan: Power delivery is not that smooth, jittering
[2022-10-06T20:35:39] Jan: @roscheeee did the Vesc setup. I did CAD and Design of mechanical components
[2022-10-06T20:35:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think u are seeing temp from front controller, because is really stranger traction control add 7¬∞CüòÖ
[2022-10-06T20:53:47] Gigolo Joe: Sounds good, give us some gps data via draggy or dragracer app
[2022-10-06T20:54:25] Gigolo Joe: Like this one for example
[2022-10-06T21:33:50] Luis Magalhaes: @AJAJ1992 the video really looks speed up üòÇ, it have to be powerful thenüí™ make it with sound next time so we can hear it üòú
[2022-10-06T21:34:51] Luis Magalhaes: Your not using max specs in that right?
[2022-10-06T21:35:46] Jan: There is a tiny clock in the vesc app, its not speed up üòÖ
[2022-10-06T21:36:24] Jan: I think thats about it with the current config, roger can try another setup tomorrow and see how that performs
[2022-10-06T21:36:31] Luis Magalhaes: Yes i know it isn't but i think the same as @artBula when i see it üòÇ
[2022-10-06T21:37:00] Luis Magalhaes: Should be a beast in that frame üëå
[2022-10-06T21:38:54] Luis Magalhaes: No front wheel spin with traction controll right?
[2022-10-06T21:39:32] rosheee: wait
[2022-10-06T21:39:52] rosheee: app?
[2022-10-06T21:44:00] Luis Magalhaes: Looks like drag racer
[2022-10-06T21:44:02] Luis Magalhaes: Gps app
[2022-10-06T21:44:19] rosheee: ok maybe i go out again xD
[2022-10-06T21:45:13] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_6382@06-10-2022_21-45-13.jpg>
[2022-10-06T21:45:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Cant measure speed from phone
[2022-10-06T21:45:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Total wrong stats
[2022-10-06T21:45:36] Luis Magalhaes: Not the most precise, yet you can test the diferences but not real time
[2022-10-06T21:45:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: Gps in the phone is good to measure speed but not the acceleration
[2022-10-06T21:45:46] rosheee: HMM
[2022-10-06T21:45:55] rosheee: send dragy @PaoloWu

[2022-10-10T23:53:29] rosheee: Send
[2022-10-10T23:53:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think if I use right batt pack I can reach 25kw no prob
[2022-10-10T23:53:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: But not sure about flipsky capabilities
[2022-10-10T23:54:01] rosheee: Nice xD 20s tronic cant do it
[2022-10-10T23:54:23] rosheee: I gonna use 2x 20S battery with kelly
[2022-10-10T23:54:25] asyan4ik: If you have any questions about the ninebot, go to the rocheeee
[2022-10-10T23:54:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: I bought from him
[2022-10-10T23:54:41] rosheee: He bought 1 fe

[2022-10-10T23:54:45] rosheee: XD shit u were fasta
[2022-10-10T23:54:49] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-10-10T23:55:26] asyan4ik: I want to go up to 350 and then 400. Or as much as he'll let me.
[2022-10-10T23:55:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: I still idk how use flipsky without smart bms
[2022-10-10T23:55:49] asyan4ik: Xt90 amas
[2022-10-10T23:56:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt like plug and unplug connector :(
[2022-10-10T23:56:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: I will made a double rele circuit , first one enable precharge circuit, second one power circuit
[2022-10-10T23:57:02] asyan4ik: If u use smart BMS , Plugging in the charger will wake up the scooter
[2022-10-10T23:57:21] rosheee: When i connect kelly to battery..will it spark?
[2022-10-10T23:57:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Fortunately I‚Äôve fuckeria rele with 1inch solid copper for 250A continuos with 0w power loose

[2022-10-10T23:59:03] asyan4ik: Why do you need this shit
[2022-10-11T00:15:08] rosheee: Battery?
[2022-10-11T00:15:16] rosheee: Kelly?
[2022-10-11T00:18:13] Artem Bulashev: Vsett 9 /9+ dual motor fits 52v30ah üòÅüòÅ 21700 with no spacer basically If you put 25mm spacer you will fit standing 21700 than you can do 20s8p inside with dual ubox, all inside üòÇüòÇ - because it opens on top no clearance loss and 160km range lol
[2022-10-11T00:19:18] Artem Bulashev: Battery would weight 12kg vs scooter without battery 19 kg ü§£

[2022-10-11T15:15:03] Gigolo Joe: Anyone run traction control on dual setup? Is there a sweet spot for the rpm for maximum performance? So far i run on 12k erpm, feels good but looking for more opinions
[2022-10-11T15:16:52] Mihail: What does traction control have to do with erpm?
[2022-10-11T15:17:12] Jan: Difference trigger limit
[2022-10-11T15:17:24] Gigolo Joe: U set an erpm difference at which one motor gets less power
[2022-10-11T15:17:32] Gigolo Joe: So less wheelspin
[2022-10-11T15:17:38] Mihail: Hmm, I didn't know there was such setting
[2022-10-11T15:18:06] Gigolo Joe: App cfg->adc-> traction control
[2022-10-11T15:18:17] Mihail: Where can I find it? Im using traction control but I thought it was a toggle with no settings
[2022-10-11T15:18:30] Gigolo Joe: <photos/photo_6442@11-10-2022_15-18-30.jpg>
[2022-10-11T15:18:46] Mihail: Tnx
[2022-10-11T15:19:00] Gigolo Joe: <sticker>
[2022-10-11T15:19:34] Mihail: Mine is set to 3000, probably default
[2022-10-11T15:20:07] Mihail: Works well, I may test using lower value like 1000
[2022-10-11T15:22:02] Gigolo Joe: 3000 doesn't accelerate fast enough
[2022-10-11T15:47:38] Mihail: Weird. I'll try setting it to 100 to see how it behaves.
[2022-10-11T16:05:59] Artem Bulashev: remember
[2022-10-11T16:11:43] Artem Bulashev: Erpm is not RPM Erpm/magnet pairs = RPM So 3000 /15 motor pole pairs =200rpm That is 8kmh variance for 215mm wheel (8.5inch)
[2022-10-11T16:12:31] Artem Bulashev: 9.6kmh for 10 inch
[2022-10-11T16:13:33] Artem Bulashev: I would leave it at that I guess, as Lower will over heat controller and hight May be too much but worth a try
[2022-10-11T16:21:26] Gigolo Joe: So if go with 13000(erpm that is), what speed would it be?
[2022-10-11T16:23:38] Konstantin: Depends on motor (magnets + hell diameter)
[2022-10-11T16:24:00] Konstantin: Erpm/magnets/2 = rpm
[2022-10-11T16:26:31] Mihail: If something Is overheating I would guess it should be the front controller, right? But I have no heat issues with it. The rear controller is hotter in my setup
[2022-10-11T16:29:16] Gigolo Joe: Calculating rpm wasn't my question, i asked about speed aka km/h
[2022-10-11T16:29:59] Gigolo Joe: I knew those formulas when i was studying couple years ago, haven't used them since...
[2022-10-11T16:30:24] Mirono escooters: Well rpm is easily converted to kmh
[2022-10-11T16:30:45] Artem Bulashev: If your VESC or motor is running hot I didn‚Äôt advice it
[2022-10-11T16:31:08] Mihail: <photos/photo_6443@11-10-2022_16-31-08.jpg>
[2022-10-11T16:32:03] Gigolo Joe: Nah, dual system stays pretty cool
[2022-10-11T16:32:13] Gigolo Joe: Thank you
[2022-10-11T16:32:50] Konstantin: –û–Ω–ª–∞–π–Ω –∫–∞–ª—å–∫—É–ª—è—Ç–æ—Ä: –£–≥–ª–æ–≤–∞—è –∏ –ª–∏–Ω–µ–π–Ω–∞—è —Å–∫–æ—Ä–æ—Å—Ç—å https://planetcalc.ru/556/
[2022-10-11T16:33:24] Gigolo Joe: –ï—â—ë –ª—É—á—à–µ
[2022-10-11T16:35:00] Konstantin: It's very simple... Now y can understand erpm, rpm, and how to convert it to kmh mph
[2022-10-11T16:35:41] Gigolo Joe: Motor after long runs (10+km) on highway are warm to touch, controllers reach max 70-75 depends on which controller
[2022-10-11T17:10:23] Artem Bulashev: That same as I said (magnet pole pair = magnets /2)
[2022-10-11T17:10:50] Artem Bulashev: What diameter?
[2022-10-11T17:12:03] Artem Bulashev: 75 is as high as you may want it to go
[2022-10-11T17:12:44] Gigolo Joe: 240mm
[2022-10-11T17:12:48] Konstantin: Y
[2022-10-11T17:13:12] Gigolo Joe: On lower power it goes upto 60, but i have smol pp so need Big power
[2022-10-11T17:17:02] Artem Bulashev: How many magnets or magnet pole pairs?
[2022-10-11T17:18:02] Gigolo Joe: 30 magnets aka 15 pair
[2022-10-11T17:20:31] Artem Bulashev: 13000Erpm = 42kmh delta in speed between wheels before anti-slip engages
[2022-10-11T17:20:42] Artem Bulashev: I would say that is too much ü§£
[2022-10-11T17:21:04] Artem Bulashev: May be 6000erpm at most would be some what reasonable
[2022-10-11T17:24:19] Mihail: Ok, I did some testing and I feel like 2-3k erpm feels the best. 5k was slipping too much. I also tried 300 but it linited the power a lot
[2022-10-11T18:08:46] Jan: 2-3k is fine but i cant live with the power loss and sometimes its cutting all power if the slip is too much
[2022-10-11T18:12:12] Mihail: I would think that slipping tire would be slower.
[2022-10-11T18:13:36] Jan: The traction control just doesnt work right in my experience
[2022-10-11T18:14:32] Jan: And in the first case like @roscheeee came up with the idea that you dont need it if you address a power per erpm curve to the front motor
[2022-10-11T18:44:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: üò≥üò≥ü§™
[2022-10-11T18:52:44] Jan: Vesc software for it is not written yet
[2022-10-11T19:20:59] Mihail: Isn't that the same as setting lower phase current? Power will increase gradually, while maintaining set current
[2022-10-11T19:29:13] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Easy, if your battery set to 70A for front, then you can set 70A phase fo front. No freespins. Speed increases and battery amps increases then you dont lose torque on higher speed
[2022-10-11T19:29:18] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I use like that
[2022-10-11T19:29:44] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Rear amps can be anything with phase before it starts freespins
[2022-10-11T19:36:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Nah, not working out, have 70A batt. I set 90A to keep my Ubox Single cool enough, but had not enough torque to gain more speed. With 170A phase no problem, will go down to 120A.
[2022-10-11T19:36:47] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: So minimum I can set is about 120A phase, if not I can not reach more speed.
[2022-10-11T19:44:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: Problem is you running single motor
[2022-10-11T19:45:13] Mirono escooters: Overheating shit esc is
[2022-10-11T19:46:39] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: This
[2022-10-11T19:47:19] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Im talking about dual only and 2 motors
[2022-10-11T19:48:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Rear has 200A phase and 100A batt, front is 70A batt and 70A phase. I.e
[2022-10-11T19:48:45] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Works pretty well. Didnt use traction control ever
[2022-10-11T19:48:46] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yeah ok
[2022-10-11T20:47:28] Face de Pin Suc√©: Not possible
[2022-10-11T20:47:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: You kept same current settings?
[2022-10-11T20:48:47] Face de Pin Suc√©: Meaning you have now lower current settings on rear motor ?
[2022-10-11T20:53:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Not really, it got better after opening it up, placing a lot of pads and paste on it and now it is not heating up that fast, but still I reach 80¬∞C occasionally.
[2022-10-11T20:53:45] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: And always have to throttle down to keep it somewhat cool
[2022-10-11T20:55:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes sure. One sec.
[2022-10-11T20:57:23] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <photos/photo_6444@11-10-2022_20-57-23.jpg>
[2022-10-11T20:57:24] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: That's what I did. I replaced the pads on the MOSFETs with paste and put in-between the MOSFETs shitty pads (use better ones instead of me, but these were the only one I could get cheap and quick) and it works better than stock...
[2022-10-11T20:59:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 70A battery, ~160A Phase. On how quick it heats up, well...
[2022-10-11T21:07:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think you should try 80A batt and 130A phase, solder bigger phase wire. I can reach 90kmh no prob with 18s
[2022-10-11T21:08:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: Flipsky 75100 with stock mos with original case
[2022-10-11T21:09:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: alright, can try, but don't know how much the LLT 60A BMS can keep up.
[2022-10-11T21:09:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Maximum I pulled from it is 74A so far.
[2022-10-11T21:09:26] Konstantin: Give me a photo
[2022-10-11T21:09:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: of what
[2022-10-11T21:09:36] Konstantin: Bms
[2022-10-11T21:09:42] Konstantin: Or link

[2022-10-11T21:12:47] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but should be probably fine, only 37¬∞C after my session.
[2022-10-11T21:13:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But I should swap out the cables first...
[2022-10-11T21:19:21] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: And my external battery is fine anyway.
[2022-10-11T21:23:50] Konstantin: 160a easy keep
[2022-10-11T21:56:04] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: ah yes, when you give the scooter to a friend and he immediately goes smoking your tyre üòÖ
[2022-10-11T21:57:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ask to @roscheeee , he change tire every month, pmt 10x3 50‚Ç¨üòÇ

[2022-10-12T04:40:51] Rogerio Figueiredo: Besides the pirate build
[2022-10-12T04:40:56] Rogerio Figueiredo: I have pirate videos
[2022-10-12T09:14:59] Kris: Yes I am building on laotie ti30/boyueda frame but huge amount of modifications needed and folding mechanism is crap,factory handlebar too small for bigger speeds(running without steering damper as I think it takes away feeling for the scooter) currently building better battery for it,still running dual flipsky 75100, when battery is build I am putting no limit firmware on them with better cooling offcourse,anyway the scooter full of flaws(I have laotie es18 aswell and it is shit aswell)
[2022-10-12T11:34:59] Mirono escooters: They handle abuse

[2022-10-12T13:19:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You try ti mix something without knowing and thinking,while all said like its good But do yOu know how this works ,,how its made ,for what? Xiaomi and Ninebot contoller a like keeps all powered up only , main chip is cutted by enable leg ,this is a protected circuit There is no such thing in vesc ,in non And fancy shit comes up really when you may accidently use brake or throttle while using enable leg burns immidiatly

[2022-10-12T13:23:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: While all what Mihail trying to do is really interesting!
[2022-10-12T13:27:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yeah they have dedicated circuit for that ,hope you get it now
[2022-10-12T13:30:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: üëÜüëÜüëÜ
[2022-10-12T13:31:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: I want to understand what's happening when you push throttle while powering the VESC with enable pin
[2022-10-12T13:31:30] Mirono escooters: We never said its ez/you shouldnt know basic electtronicsü§¶
[2022-10-12T13:31:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: Like, what makes it burn
[2022-10-12T13:34:46] Mihail: Regulator turns off, so voltage on gate drivers goes under 8V. The transistors can't fully open and they burn because of that. Flipsky uses shitty gate drivers,this doesn't happen on xiaomi because they have 10v uvlo on their drivers.
[2022-10-12T13:34:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Imagine how much ppl had any, when he started this , just had the idea to upgrade his Scooter , Imagine how much burnt back in time just in a diag
[2022-10-12T13:37:40] Face de Pin Suc√©: Why regulator turns off ?
[2022-10-12T13:38:25] Mihail: In normal circumstances it shouldn't
[2022-10-12T13:38:35] Mihail: But there is always risk
[2022-10-12T13:38:54] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Exact the same as you pull full throttle when you plug the main Power, if the Enable pin is not trigged, the 12V is at 0v Driver can't turn on the mosfet, the uC is at 0V the uC can't order the driver to turn on the Mosfet.....
[2022-10-12T13:39:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: Okay, but what about when powering on as said ?
[2022-10-12T14:03:27] Artem Bulashev: I know this has nothing to do with vsett but the new kaabo dispaly is already very sexy . Hopefully the protocol is correct üòÑ
[2022-10-12T14:03:38] Artem Bulashev: Would be awesome to get this one to work on vesc

[2022-10-12T14:53:08] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: That's at least something

[2022-10-13T00:25:20] Mirono escooters: A round tire is kinda a key feature
[2022-10-13T00:25:31] Mirono escooters: Im no expert but feel like oval would ride funny
[2022-10-13T00:25:35] Mirono escooters: *this is sarcasm*
[2022-10-13T05:25:01] Cass: <sticker>
[2022-10-13T13:50:53] Mirono escooters: I forgot where you change frequency of mosfets in vesc
[2022-10-13T13:51:09] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2022-10-13T14:05:15] Ofek üê•: FOC->Advanced
[2022-10-13T14:08:33] Mirono escooters: And it was /2 right
[2022-10-13T14:08:43] Mirono escooters: Is there a min/max?
[2022-10-13T14:21:25] Gigolo Joe: <photos/photo_6474@13-10-2022_14-21-25.jpg>
[2022-10-13T14:22:00] Mirono escooters: :)
[2022-10-13T14:24:26] Ofek üê•: Only in BLDC if I remember correctly
[2022-10-13T14:24:49] Mirono escooters: Well esc overheats Motor not So lower khz?
[2022-10-13T14:25:30] Ofek üê•: Yes I use 20kHz, I think you can go as low as 16kHz
[2022-10-13T14:25:54] Mirono escooters: Ok
[2022-10-13T14:26:05] Mirono escooters: 16khz/2 Lol thats default Xiaomi
[2022-10-13T14:26:07] Mirono escooters: Ill try 20
[2022-10-13T14:26:15] Mirono escooters: Dont mind loud motor sounds coolüòÇ
[2022-10-13T14:26:58] Gigolo Joe: Yes
[2022-10-13T14:27:06] Mirono escooters: Ok
[2022-10-13T14:27:06] Ofek üê•: If its high pitch I hate it. In low frequency sound is BEEFY üòÑ
[2022-10-13T14:27:12] Mirono escooters: Yes true
[2022-10-13T14:27:15] Mirono escooters: Angry motor
[2022-10-13T14:27:30] Gigolo Joe: U can go as low as 16khz
[2022-10-13T14:27:47] Gigolo Joe: If 20 won't be enough
[2022-10-13T14:27:55] Mirono escooters: Ok lets see
[2022-10-13T14:27:57] Mirono escooters: Idk what im at
[2022-10-13T14:28:01] Gigolo Joe: I run on 20khz both escs
[2022-10-13T14:28:50] Gigolo Joe: Maybe even lower, for example ASI BAC controllers run on 15khz
[2022-10-13T16:21:32] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Zero vector here is 30kHz
[2022-10-13T16:21:48] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: So you need to type 30kHz for 15khz pwm of motors
[2022-10-13T16:22:16] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Please, dont confuse it
[2022-10-13T16:25:42] Gigolo Joe: People in this group been running 20khz zero vector and some even lower
[2022-10-13T16:28:23] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Me and roscheee running at >25kHz zero vector freq. It is >12.5kHz motor pwm
[2022-10-13T16:28:36] Gigolo Joe: <video_file>
[2022-10-13T16:29:17] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Also by default in vesc it is 20kHz pwm. Means 40kHz zero vector
[2022-10-13T16:29:29] Gigolo Joe: How to i find what my motor pwm is?
[2022-10-13T16:29:38] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You dont find it
[2022-10-13T16:29:39] Gigolo Joe: Or what's the optimal?
[2022-10-13T16:29:44] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You set what freq you want
[2022-10-13T16:31:19] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Sorry, this is set by zero vector freq
[2022-10-13T16:31:41] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Check info boxes in vesc tool
[2022-10-13T16:32:02] Gigolo Joe: So far i run both on 20khz zero vector, no strange sounds, and smooth acceleration
[2022-10-13T16:33:53] Gigolo Joe: I know what i said. Asi bac855 runs at 15khz zero vector. At least from the files i have for them
[2022-10-13T18:08:12] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Sooo its 10kHz pwm for motors
[2022-10-13T18:18:34] Artem Bulashev: You don‚Äôt find it you choose
[2022-10-13T18:19:18] Artem Bulashev: Lower frequency = less heat on fets, but more on motor (less efficient motor drive) Higher frequency = more heat on fets, less heat on motor
[2022-10-13T18:19:41] Artem Bulashev: So you can use it to balance the temp if one heats up too much while other is cool
[2022-10-13T18:20:20] Gigolo Joe: This is know üëåüòÑ That's why i lowered to 20khz on the vector, front controller was reaching high temps for some reason...
[2022-10-13T18:20:26] Jan: Yeah will try 30khz-40khz as motors are more the issue
[2022-10-13T18:21:10] Jan: I got the feeling that the benefits are not linear
[2022-10-13T18:21:37] Jan: Motors wouldnt not be much more efficient if you could 1Mhz or 1Ghz lol
[2022-10-13T18:22:43] Artem Bulashev: Some vesc + motor combos can get into issue at specific frequency
[2022-10-13T18:22:53] Artem Bulashev: That is worth keeping a note about
[2022-10-13T18:23:24] Jan: So its try and error ? ü§∑
[2022-10-13T18:23:40] Artem Bulashev: Normally no issues regardless of motor
[2022-10-13T18:23:49] Artem Bulashev: But on rare cases it Can happen
[2022-10-13T18:23:58] Artem Bulashev: About efficiency
[2022-10-13T18:24:23] Artem Bulashev: 10 kHz PWM is extremely old School üòÇ
[2022-10-13T18:24:37] Jan: 20khz 30¬∞C controller 80¬∞C motor
[2022-10-13T18:25:05] Jan: The question is at 40khz is it 70¬∞C and 70¬∞C?
[2022-10-13T18:25:38] Artem Bulashev: This days most power systems run at 16khz pwm or 32pwm Some even do 64pwm for great sine wave modulation
[2022-10-13T18:26:44] Artem Bulashev: Higher pwm reduces low throttle torque btw
[2022-10-13T18:27:26] Artem Bulashev: Not sure if it will be noticeable in Escooters though (vesc doesn‚Äôt support high enough pwm to get into this aspect I think)
[2022-10-13T18:28:04] Artem Bulashev: Is that a question or stats you got?
[2022-10-13T18:28:12] Jan: A question
[2022-10-13T18:35:40] Artem Bulashev: Oh no ideal
[2022-10-13T18:36:02] Artem Bulashev: But 2x pwm I would say about -20% temp
[2022-10-13T18:36:43] Artem Bulashev: So 20 kHz setting to 40khz setting should change max temp from 70c down to 55c
[2022-10-13T18:37:22] Artem Bulashev: Controller temp likely + 40% I would estimate - it will depend on FET model I guess and driver model
[2022-10-13T18:38:38] Jan: Ok
[2022-10-13T18:38:42] Jan: Will try
[2022-10-13T19:00:13] Jan: Gonna be a while, i go to japan on saturday until november
[2022-10-13T19:00:22] Jan: Then testing
[2022-10-13T19:00:58] Mirono escooters: Cant go on forever tho?
[2022-10-13T19:01:03] Mirono escooters: I mean sucg simple formula
[2022-10-13T19:01:10] Mirono escooters: Have fun, for god knows what :)
[2022-10-13T19:01:51] Jan: Thanks
[2022-10-13T19:59:38] –û–ª–µ–≥ –ö—É–Ω—á–µ–Ω–∫–æ: Hi. How to use this pins with three position switch?
[2022-10-13T21:03:25] Oliver Eliasson: With nothing connected its in M mode. To get H mode you bridge M and H and for L mode you bridge M and L. Then do that on your switch. I just use a normal latching switch for high mode and normal mode. Dont need three modes o feel

[2022-10-13T22:55:06] asyan4ik: Yeap
[2022-10-13T23:44:24] rosheee: What ks problem?
[2022-10-14T00:14:34] asyan4ik: Watch the video with sound
[2022-10-14T00:14:43] asyan4ik: Sound from the motor and current -1-5a

[2022-10-14T00:16:33] asyan4ik: <photos/photo_6478@14-10-2022_00-16-33.jpg>
[2022-10-14T00:18:53] asyan4ik: The problem occurs at full throttle
[2022-10-14T00:20:15] asyan4ik: If 60-70% ok Else >70 no ok , noise from motors
[2022-10-14T00:22:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I think I had a guy with a similar issue, but he solved it by flashing my 6.0 beta firmware (mine for the Flipsky). Don't know about what VESC you are using. @Asyan4ik
[2022-10-14T00:23:53] asyan4ik: Yeap , I use 75100 alu PCB
[2022-10-14T00:24:41] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, this looks similar to your issue.
[2022-10-14T00:24:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: What firmware are you using? Stock 5.2, jaykup 5.3, jaykup 6.0, 1zuna 6.0?
[2022-10-14T00:25:05] asyan4ik: I flashed from wizard 6.0 to drive home. I drove slowly and I don't like it, it's long, very long
[2022-10-14T00:25:50] asyan4ik: Oh fck This is it.
[2022-10-14T00:26:40] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: from wizard? You mean from the VESC Tool?
[2022-10-14T00:26:55] asyan4ik: 5.2 stock no limits , 5.3 no limits , jaykup and build it myself
[2022-10-14T00:27:06] asyan4ik: Y
[2022-10-14T00:27:58] asyan4ik: Mb share u firmware?;)
[2022-10-14T00:28:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: https://github.com/m365fw/vesc_bldc You can merge the latest changes into it and compile it yourself or get the last built firmware from the "Actions" tab (requires the VESC Tool it was built for...), it is no HW limits anyway.
[2022-10-14T00:37:47] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I wish there would be a History of all VESC Tool builds ... so annoying
[2022-10-14T00:38:38] asyan4ik: 75_100 build &
[2022-10-14T00:44:56] asyan4ik: tomorrow I'll try, but I seem to have already tried these firmware.
[2022-10-14T00:45:02] asyan4ik: thank u

[2022-10-14T00:55:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Hello @Asyan4ik do you have a custom firmware for flipsky? As stock what is the current limit?
[2022-10-14T00:58:58] asyan4ik: Hello . I use custom frmwr 500 absolute ,200 battery. But now I run into a problem
[2022-10-14T00:59:46] asyan4ik: Normal for 75100 200-250 phase 450-500 absolute 100-150 bat
[2022-10-14T01:00:22] asyan4ik: And hopefully it won't explode.
[2022-10-14T01:00:40] asyan4ik: I use 18s battery
[2022-10-14T01:01:33] asyan4ik: Stock no limits
[2022-10-14T01:05:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: Each esc? What battery you have?
[2022-10-14T01:11:02] asyan4ik: Catl 53ah
[2022-10-14T01:12:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: Oh right you are using lifepo4? Then your rated voltage is likely 16s? Amazing to see lifepo4 in escooter
[2022-10-14T01:13:05] asyan4ik: No
[2022-10-14T01:14:08] asyan4ik: <photos/photo_6479@14-10-2022_01-14-08.jpg>

[2022-10-14T01:28:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: I like it, but this cell is 100A continuos, you are using it at 400A ? Isn‚Äôt too much?
[2022-10-14T02:09:47] rosheee: Like me using 5x 50G at 200A peak
[2022-10-14T04:35:09] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yeah nah fuck wet sidewalk üòÇ I'll try it later when everything is dry again...

[2022-10-14T08:10:24] Face de Pin Suc√©: If you use Rion motors, you won't be able to reach more than 120 maybe 125Kmh
[2022-10-14T08:10:31] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: https://youtu.be/EHbLnpGt-Tw
[2022-10-14T08:10:38] Face de Pin Suc√©: Rion Thrust 20S maxed at 116Kmh
[2022-10-14T08:10:57] Face de Pin Suc√©: 21S, haven't got the chance to test it
[2022-10-14T08:11:04] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: My motors are 43Kv, max speed on them is 160km/h

[2022-10-14T08:12:32] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, that doesn't mean they have the torque to reach that speed
[2022-10-14T08:13:00] Face de Pin Suc√©: I know these motors, I think you won't go more than 125Kmh with those
[2022-10-14T08:13:13] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: They have plenty of torque ‚Ä¶ üòÖüòÖüòÖ but i‚Äôm sure too they will not go that much either
[2022-10-14T08:13:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: But, when you try, we will know üòÅ

[2022-10-14T08:15:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: Honestly, 9.8s 0-100Kmh with 7230S controllers, is not what I call plenty of torque To compare, Weped with RageMechanics motors with 7218S and 20S9P 50E (can't max current settings because of shitty battery) did less than 7s 0-100Kmh, dragy approuved
[2022-10-14T08:16:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: I think you should work on your 0-100, with 7230s and 21S battery, you can do much better I think

[2022-10-14T09:08:26] Mirono escooters: How u smoke em
[2022-10-14T09:15:32] Artem Bulashev: You only can do 10 to 20khz on vesc (20-40khz setting)
[2022-10-14T09:26:36] Jan: The benefits have to get smaller and smaller the higher you go
[2022-10-14T09:26:56] Jan: At some point its just not worth it anymore for the motor
[2022-10-14T09:27:26] Jan: And the controller is it enjoying less and less
[2022-10-14T09:30:53] Artem Bulashev: On vesc spread is not that high
[2022-10-14T09:30:59] Artem Bulashev: 10-20khz pwm
[2022-10-14T09:31:32] Artem Bulashev: I don‚Äôt think vesc does higher
[2022-10-14T09:31:43] Artem Bulashev: That is very small selection
[2022-10-14T09:32:38] Artem Bulashev: On custom build copters we used 8-16, 16-32, 32-64khz controllers
[2022-10-14T09:33:25] Mirono escooters: Xiaomi 8-16khz lol
[2022-10-14T09:33:41] Artem Bulashev: üëç
[2022-10-14T09:34:00] Artem Bulashev: Pwm or zero vector?
[2022-10-14T09:35:02] Artem Bulashev: If pwm Because that is 16-32khz zero vector than. Which is close to vesc
[2022-10-14T09:35:49] Mirono escooters: Pwm
[2022-10-14T09:36:16] Mirono escooters: Well we did mod vesc firmware on it and a adequate chip replacement even
[2022-10-14T09:36:22] Mirono escooters: Crazy what they do to it ü§∑
[2022-10-14T09:41:44] Artem Bulashev: Btw found info that vesc supports up to 150khz ? (75khz pwm)
[2022-10-14T09:41:54] Mirono escooters: Thafak? Really?
[2022-10-14T09:42:06] Mirono escooters: Poor MOSFETs but must be ultra quiet
[2022-10-14T09:42:17] Mirono escooters: Does pwm have any influence on halls
[2022-10-14T09:43:29] Artem Bulashev: That doesn‚Äôt sound right
[2022-10-14T09:44:03] Jan: Vesc doing 150khz
[2022-10-14T09:44:04] Jan: <animation>
[2022-10-14T09:44:16] Artem Bulashev: ‚ÄúMax reliable frequency is 30Khz with V7 or 60Khz without it‚Äù
[2022-10-14T09:47:03] Artem Bulashev: ‚Äúnew feature in the firmware let the PWM frequency be a multiple of the control loop so you can have 100 kHz PWM and 20 kHz current control.‚Äù
[2022-10-14T09:47:10] Artem Bulashev: What is that feature ?
[2022-10-14T17:53:44] Luis Magalhaes: Dam fat cable üòÇ

[2022-10-15T09:23:16] pinkflozd: Do i need a PRO2 dash to run the lisp script or does it work also with PRO1 dash running 0.90ble?
[2022-10-15T12:48:11] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I cannot tell. Do you mean the 4 dot display? Probably won't work very well, but you can give it a try.
[2022-10-15T12:50:56] Mirono escooters: No
[2022-10-15T12:51:02] Mirono escooters: Works fine :)
[2022-10-15T14:22:43] Nome: The lisp works on ble 0.90 but is a slow shit ... with the code is full it gets slow on first start
[2022-10-15T14:24:12] Nome: then sometimes it freezes and you have to restart the controller üòì
[2022-10-15T14:29:53] Nome: however i saw that in the latest version of the beta firmware, on the lisp it should be better but i have not tried it...
[2022-10-15T15:24:38] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: For me on BLE 1.2.9/1.3.2 (I actually don't really know which one I am running) it works very well. Can you not flash it on the PRO1 BLE?
[2022-10-15T15:58:50] pinkflozd: It's like the new dashes but has ECO instead of the walking man
[2022-10-15T15:59:18] pinkflozd: gonna try with 0.90 first. Still waiting for the connectors so i can mutilate the original connections :D
[2022-10-15T15:59:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Oh ok. I thought the walking man is a only Germany thing
[2022-10-15T16:00:03] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: üëç
[2022-10-15T17:08:26] Mirono escooters: So original dashes lol
[2022-10-15T17:08:38] Mirono escooters: Pro1 Pro2/1s is walkman
[2022-10-15T17:50:11] Luis Magalhaes: In Portugal exist too üòÇ
[2022-10-15T17:55:23] Thierry: I tried with purple 0.90 and didn't work so I switched to pro 2 dashboard with 129 without any issue
[2022-10-15T17:57:18] Mirono escooters: Purple cheap and shit
[2022-10-15T17:59:13] Thierry: Maybe i was lucky, I used it for thousands of km without any problem
[2022-10-15T17:59:27] Mirono escooters: Well normal xiaomi sure..
[2022-10-15T17:59:49] Thierry: So maybe original 090 ble will work with lisp
[2022-10-15T18:00:15] Mirono escooters: Probably
[2022-10-16T13:03:02] asyan4ik: It's strange. what am i doing wrong?
[2022-10-16T13:03:02] asyan4ik: <photos/photo_6489@16-10-2022_13-03-02.jpg>
[2022-10-16T13:03:21] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: wrong vesc tool version
[2022-10-16T13:03:48] asyan4ik: ESC¬Æ Tool 4.00 Test Version 9 Original Version
[2022-10-16T13:04:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: So it is the latest beta you downloaded?
[2022-10-16T13:04:46] asyan4ik: yeap
[2022-10-16T13:05:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yeah then firmware a lil older. One sec.
[2022-10-16T13:07:41] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yeah it was 2 commits behind, there you go: https://github.com/m365fw/vesc_bldc/actions/runs/3259246060 (still building it)
[2022-10-16T13:09:25] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I should just bundle the VESC Tool with the firmware, fuck vedderb with his download page. ü§î
[2022-10-16T13:55:32] asyan4ik: Great. I'll try it tonight to see if it makes that sound again.
[2022-10-16T16:20:07] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: my friend on wet road going 88km/h with 80A / 130A phase without any field weakening
[2022-10-16T16:24:52] Nome: @kawaiinekololis is the firmware of the latest beta of vesc?
[2022-10-16T16:27:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes.
[2022-10-16T16:27:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 3 hours ago
[2022-10-16T16:33:40] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: still ubox single
[2022-10-16T16:34:12] Nome: just last night i was trying to do it, but with my windows computer i couldn't üòÖ
[2022-10-16T16:34:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: it works out, max was 78 degree before he let go of the throttle
[2022-10-16T16:35:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yeah much better with the thermal pads and paste now
[2022-10-16T16:35:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but only for lightweight people
[2022-10-16T16:35:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I need to push more phase to accelerate and then it sucks ass
[2022-10-16T16:35:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 22S
[2022-10-16T16:36:00] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: no blade 50mm 1200w
[2022-10-16T16:36:02] T·ëå·ñá·ó∑O·îï·ó©·îï·ëï·ïº: Big balls i would say
[2022-10-16T16:36:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yeah
[2022-10-16T16:36:42] Mirono escooters: Quality
[2022-10-16T16:38:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: from car looks sloow xdd
[2022-10-16T16:39:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: this
[2022-10-16T16:40:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: making light from behind
[2022-10-16T16:40:42] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yeah
[2022-10-16T16:40:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: i was like "huh is he even pushing"
[2022-10-16T16:44:25] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yeah and he was not even close to battery power limit
[2022-10-16T16:44:36] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: still pushing 120A phase with only 6kW at 88km/h
[2022-10-16T16:44:42] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: ü§î
[2022-10-16T16:45:28] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: absolutely
[2022-10-16T16:47:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: somewhat, it still accelerates at 88 but not fast enough to reach it before he lets go of the throttle
[2022-10-16T16:47:36] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but for wet road condition it was pretty good
[2022-10-16T16:48:20] Mirono escooters: Wind resistance go brr
[2022-10-16T16:48:26] Mirono escooters: Single motor
[2022-10-16T16:48:27] Mirono escooters: F
[2022-10-16T16:48:31] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: this man has balls of steel. I told him to be careful and the wind was pushing him around
[2022-10-16T16:48:45] Mirono escooters: Id volunteer
[2022-10-16T16:49:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I only go fast with helmet and dry road at daylight
[2022-10-16T16:49:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: no
[2022-10-16T16:49:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: don't know
[2022-10-16T16:49:47] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but is it alright
[2022-10-16T16:49:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: never too hot to touch
[2022-10-16T16:50:03] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: no ferrofluid
[2022-10-16T16:51:13] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: should be alright. I never go fast that long, there is pretty much no use of going 80 kmh for longer than a few km (which u basically reach in 3-5min max.)
[2022-10-16T16:52:50] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I might add a temp sensor in the future when I upgrade the phase cables, but with ubox single makes no sense. But that should be the limit of power I will go on the single motor. I might try increasing phase amps and turn on field weakening but that's it.
[2022-10-16T16:53:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: pro2
[2022-10-16T16:54:00] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: will do another g30 with dual motor
[2022-10-16T16:54:35] Mirono escooters: Vsett wins
[2022-10-16T16:57:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: no sadly not
[2022-10-16T16:57:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: with bag
[2022-10-16T16:58:15] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: that's why I will go with g30 cuz too much space limitiation
[2022-10-16T16:58:48] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Need like big triangle shield thing in front of you to cut the wind to the sides and then you will be in a "vacuum", then it will be as slow as in a car tooüòÖ
[2022-10-16T17:01:05] Mirono escooters: "s" makes little space "P" matters too 22s3p or 12s5p is almost same space xd
[2022-10-16T17:02:41] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I don't know if 20S6P will make sense in G30 or I try going with 24S5P.
[2022-10-16T17:03:03] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but 24S asss cuz too close to 100v and uncommon
[2022-10-16T17:03:32] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: No, will not work
[2022-10-16T17:03:36] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Too much

[2022-10-16T17:03:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 20S6P will fit
[2022-10-16T17:03:57] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 120 cells
[2022-10-16T17:04:01] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 24S5P
[2022-10-16T17:04:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 120 cells
[2022-10-16T17:04:07] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but maybe ass layout
[2022-10-16T17:04:18] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Esc will not work at 24s
[2022-10-16T17:04:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yeah maybe use 150v mosfets
[2022-10-16T17:04:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but ass rdson
[2022-10-16T17:04:30] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: No
[2022-10-16T17:04:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: why no
[2022-10-16T17:04:43] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You need to recompile every components
[2022-10-16T17:04:54] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Every capacitors, resistors, fets, dc dc
[2022-10-16T17:04:57] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: that's no problem
[2022-10-16T17:05:01] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Firmware also
[2022-10-16T17:05:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: the vesc I am planning to use is basically custom
[2022-10-16T17:05:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I have to make it anyway
[2022-10-16T17:05:18] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Then no problemüëç
[2022-10-16T17:05:59] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Right now no 24s escs besides rion
[2022-10-16T17:06:14] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: And 3shulmotors one
[2022-10-16T17:06:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: what mosfets is rion using?
[2022-10-16T17:06:33] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I dunno
[2022-10-16T17:06:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 150v ones or are they doing risky with 100v
[2022-10-16T17:06:48] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 150v is excellent
[2022-10-16T17:07:00] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But very expensive if good rds and current
[2022-10-16T17:07:23] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Or use more fets in parallelü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2022-10-16T17:07:30] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: = Bigger box
[2022-10-16T17:07:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: ready for 30S4P in g30 üòù jk
[2022-10-16T17:08:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but before I do anything I have to check if the vesc going to work out
[2022-10-16T17:09:01] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Really like that people here are trying to create something more powerful and with good knowledge
[2022-10-16T17:22:17] Mirono escooters: 20s cool
[2022-10-16T17:22:27] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-10-16T17:22:31] Mirono escooters: Wh important not qh
[2022-10-16T17:22:41] Mirono escooters: Just more wind resistance more drain blabla
[2022-10-16T17:34:00] Mirono escooters: Controller limits, safety, good layout.ü§∑
[2022-10-16T17:34:10] Mirono escooters: Im limited to 16s.. makerx vesc :/
[2022-10-16T17:34:22] Mirono escooters: Fully charged or almost empty feels so different :/
[2022-10-16T17:34:47] Mirono escooters: And amps is heat so yea
[2022-10-16T17:35:09] Mirono escooters: Oh and still need some p for good batt ampsü§∑
[2022-10-16T17:35:16] Mirono escooters: Want sum torque
[2022-10-16T17:37:47] Jan: From my experience, do 20s5p
[2022-10-16T17:38:58] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Because of expensive components
[2022-10-16T17:39:11] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: and larger sizes
[2022-10-16T17:39:52] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Also, until they use up all the stocks of what they have now, they will not move on to new things
[2022-10-16T17:40:13] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: just business
[2022-10-16T17:43:28] Mirono escooters: ü§î
[2022-10-16T17:43:32] Mirono escooters: Still need batt amps
[2022-10-16T17:50:16] Jan: P45B in a 5p layout is still 225A battery
[2022-10-16T17:50:30] Jan: Thats 20kW easy
[2022-10-16T17:56:04] Jan: Really depends on what battery
[2022-10-16T17:56:19] Jan: P45B is probably the best cell today for that
[2022-10-16T18:32:24] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yes g30 is good because of that
[2022-10-16T18:40:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: "we are going 90?" üòÇ
[2022-10-16T18:41:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Are there any seller? Because NKON does not seem to sell them. Is it possible to get from Molicel directly as a consumer?
[2022-10-16T18:41:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: Best is 30T
[2022-10-16T18:46:34] Rogerio Figueiredo: This cells are to mutch expensive
[2022-10-16T18:46:39] Rogerio Figueiredo: For my wallet
[2022-10-16T18:46:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: for me too üòÇ
[2022-10-16T19:26:46] Rogerio Figueiredo: I use only 18650
[2022-10-16T20:24:10] asyan4ik: No acceleration dynamics
[2022-10-16T21:06:53] Jan: No not for discharge current
[2022-10-16T21:14:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, 30T is the best for discharge current than any cell in the market. 45B has very good density but not discharge rate than 30T.
[2022-10-16T21:15:31] Jan: 30T = 35A P45B = 45A ?
[2022-10-16T21:17:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: The rated discharge current isn‚Äôt the effective discharge capability that the cell can do. Likely 50S is 30A rated but can 20A max without overheat it, likely 48X that 10A rated but can do much more.
[2022-10-16T21:20:31] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 50s 25A
[2022-10-16T21:20:54] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But yea, its the best right now about balance
[2022-10-16T21:21:32] Jan: How much then?

[2022-10-16T21:22:11] Mirono escooters: ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨
[2022-10-16T21:22:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: Even the real discharge capability depends by the internal resistance, that‚Äôs inversely proportional

[2022-10-16T21:27:11] Jan: I still do not see how the 30T is better. Do you have a comparison for continuous discharge?
[2022-10-16T21:30:52] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: For me 40T, p42a and p45b right now are the most powerful
[2022-10-16T21:31:54] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Also, commercial 40T can be found with 6mOm internal. Then shit kicks ass
[2022-10-16T21:33:32] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: My p42a pack has only 7.95-8mOm in all 180pcs
[2022-10-16T21:48:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: 30T also 5mohm in the last batch
[2022-10-16T21:48:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: Molicel I found at higher resistance too
[2022-10-16T21:49:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: But I bought molicel in 2021, maybe the newest are a bit better
[2022-10-16T21:50:54] Jan: P45B claims 20% less internsl resistance than P42A
[2022-10-16T22:08:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: Molicel rated resistance is about 10mOhm
[2022-10-16T22:08:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: -20% is then 8mOhm like 40T
[2022-10-16T22:12:50] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 8-9 in real
[2022-10-16T22:13:20] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But depends on batch and time

[2022-10-16T22:20:18] Jan: In the sheet P45B is higher
[2022-10-16T22:21:28] Jan: So when you have limited space, want maximum power density and budget has no limit => P45B
[2022-10-16T22:22:51] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Omg, those irs... why are they so high here
[2022-10-16T22:23:14] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Maybe its dc testing

[2022-10-17T18:48:14] sombre_enfant: Same shii
[2022-10-17T20:36:52] Nome: 16x4 would 16 strands be wound 4 times?
[2022-10-17T20:37:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: 4 turn, 16 in parallel
[2022-10-17T20:38:33] Nome: ok, that's what i meant üòâ
[2022-10-17T20:40:35] Nome: Is it better to use more wires in parallel but with a lower thickness?
[2022-10-17T20:44:30] S1m 0n: What is the difference between installing a motor the right way around and running it backwards and installing it the wrong way around and running it forwards?
[2022-10-17T20:45:05] Mirono escooters: On paper nothing
[2022-10-17T20:45:48] S1m 0n: And for software?
[2022-10-17T20:47:45] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You are tied to wire section. If you take more thin wires and will make same or lower mmq, then its useless work
[2022-10-17T20:48:16] Nome: i noticed this in xiaomi m365 motor, the phase wires are connected to the end of the winding, and the start is star connected
[2022-10-17T20:48:56] S1m 0n: I have a Vsett9 and Zero 9 controller... both motors have the brake disc (left when viewed from the front). I have a Mantis 10 controller and motor (brake disc on the right) When I connect the Vsett9 / Zero 9 controller the Mantis 10 motor turns backwards. I have found 3 positions as the motor rotates forwards when I swap the reverb & phases... but the motor makes funny noises (brrrrrr) and has hardly any power to drive (free wheel no problem )
[2022-10-17T20:49:20] Nome: more thin wires that make the same diameter should heat less?
[2022-10-17T20:52:00] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: No, if its same section in mmq, then its no difference at all
[2022-10-17T20:57:13] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You can have 1 single wire with 4mmq section or 20-21 wires in parallel with 0.5mm thickness. Same results.
[2022-10-17T20:59:30] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Or 127 wires in parallel with 0.2mm thickness
[2022-10-17T20:59:36] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Same 4mmq section
[2022-10-17T20:59:40] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Same results
[2022-10-17T20:59:47] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Etc
[2022-10-17T21:24:14] Nome: I remember reading the opposite ü§î
[2022-10-17T21:26:06] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Just calculate wire sections mmq and you will be fine
[2022-10-17T21:26:14] S1m 0n: "a thick core = high torque, low kV". I read that many "small wires, less torque, more kV"
[2022-10-17T21:26:16] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: more mmq = less heat, less resistance
[2022-10-17T21:26:33] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Low kv, balanced or high kv is only turns per coil
[2022-10-17T21:31:15] S1m 0n: Thanks üëç
[2022-10-17T21:35:25] S1m 0n: Why this than works?
[2022-10-17T21:35:54] S1m 0n: Someone told me it's like a "hardware based Foc"
[2022-10-17T21:36:34] S1m 0n: the field is weakened, making it easier to swallow errors in the circuits
[2022-10-17T21:36:55] S1m 0n: Don't know if this translation makes sense ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[2022-10-18T19:22:13] sombre_enfant: Motor wont move
[2022-10-18T19:22:59] Jan: ?
[2022-10-18T19:26:21] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Delta will transfer torque/speed by sqrt(3). So with delta motor will have 1.73 less torque and 1.73 more speed. It is way more effective to automatically change star to delta after certain high speed. But its not effective as more voltage with battery tho. It can be compared like a lot of field weakining thing. So will need more and more current
[2022-10-18T19:26:33] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: To me it sucks
[2022-10-18T19:26:50] Jan: Ok
[2022-10-18T19:26:58] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: There is software that can do the same
[2022-10-18T19:27:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, then need 1.73 more current and 1.73 more motor heat üòÇ

[2022-10-20T22:16:15] Mirono escooters: Im always confused with "u need high balancing big pack" Nah if its build properly u dont even need balancing half the time.. or im lucky with my cells..
[2022-10-20T22:16:31] Mirono escooters: Always around 0.008v delta max, balanci set to start 0.015
[2022-10-20T22:17:20] asyan4ik: I'm just testing, this bms was for another battery. But it didn't go according to plan ;)
[2022-10-20T22:19:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes but this is different balancing method
[2022-10-20T22:20:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Jk transfer current from one cell to the near with lower voltage cell
[2022-10-20T22:20:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ant I think is different
[2022-10-20T22:20:58] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-10-20T22:21:07] Mirono escooters: But still u usually dont need balancing..
[2022-10-21T02:48:22] Rogerio Figueiredo: How u can do some coding
[2022-10-21T02:49:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: I code only with php
[2022-10-21T02:49:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Cant be applied to our use :/

[2022-10-21T13:02:34] Mirono escooters: Active balancer?
[2022-10-21T13:02:40] Mirono escooters: Only for powerwalls with refurb crlls
[2022-10-21T13:08:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yes or some similar name , i read this somewhere That some uses it to have better balace all time while bms does it with a small number at the end only ,i mean some
[2022-10-21T13:09:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Why?
[2022-10-21T13:10:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I mean what he just described , not best balace ,near fast charging mostly ü§î I mean it would help ,if there is something like that ,what's good

[2022-10-21T13:12:00] Mirono escooters: High balancing needed there..
[2022-10-21T13:12:12] Mirono escooters: Better then with BMS
[2022-10-21T13:35:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ no idea i am just asking did any saw or did similar

[2022-10-21T19:11:56] Mirono escooters: Typ
[2022-10-21T19:12:05] Mirono escooters: Vesc and cheap.. Powerful and cheap..
[2022-10-21T19:12:08] Mirono escooters: Remove cheap
[2022-10-21T19:12:25] Unknown: Not cheap cheap, something with a good value for money
[2022-10-21T19:12:32] Mirono escooters: 75100 flipsky
[2022-10-21T19:12:44] Unknown: No need to be vesc
[2022-10-21T19:16:30] Mirono escooters: Wrong group then
[2022-10-21T19:29:33] Unknown: Maybe just wrong person, maybe someone else might have a more open minded and positive approach to my initial question. Or maybe my question might seem too stupid for you, but someone might have experience with escs and could point me to the right direction
[2022-10-21T19:31:29] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2022-10-21T19:31:59] Mirono escooters: *goes to vesc group* *Asks question* *Gets answer* *Oh but doesn't need to be vesc. In vesc. Group.
[2022-10-21T19:32:07] Mirono escooters: Maybe its me but sure, logic
[2022-10-21T19:32:14] Mirono escooters: Flipsky 75100 is cheap and good
[2022-10-21T19:32:22] Mirono escooters: Otherwise any china ali controller works ü§¶
[2022-10-21T19:32:38] Mirono escooters: Ps a vesc is a esc. Just advanced
[2022-10-21T19:34:40] Unknown: If you are a vesc expert, then you should know a thing of 2 about non vedder escs, you said it yourself, a vesc is an esc, vedder electronic speed controller,
[2022-10-21T19:35:07] Rogerio Figueiredo: Waiting for mine at√© century's
[2022-10-21T19:35:19] Unknown: My question was going to develop into something else,
[2022-10-21T19:35:29] Mirono escooters: üòÇ i know a thing or 2 about em buddy
[2022-10-21T19:35:32] Mirono escooters: Ok, ask
[2022-10-21T19:35:51] Unknown: Cool, virtual handshake and peace made?
[2022-10-21T19:36:11] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2022-10-21T19:36:25] Mirono escooters: Thats a yes in my language
[2022-10-21T19:37:36] Unknown: I have a makerx dv6 for my eskate, based on vesc 6, is capable of 120 phase amp, each side, the manufacturer doesn't specify battery amps, but in the esk8 community we know not to exceed 60 per side,
[2022-10-21T19:38:44] Unknown: Now, my skate has a very very good acceleration, and a top loaded speed of 30mph, this is the current gearing, if I change gearing, i can probably go up to 40/45 mph having still a good torque,
[2022-10-21T19:39:23] Unknown: But I see scooters doing 60mph with deadly acceleration,
[2022-10-21T19:39:43] Unknown: What esc do they use
[2022-10-21T19:41:05] Unknown: And, are those esk8 vesc value real, or is it possible that manufactures can use different components so we, on the vesc tool, put 120 motor amps, 60battery amp (per side) but in reality, the esc is only using part of it me
[2022-10-21T19:41:38] Mirono escooters: Vesc, mostly
[2022-10-21T19:41:40] Mirono escooters: Rion vesc
[2022-10-21T19:42:11] Unknown: Because as far as I know, on the vesc tool I'm pulling 6.5kw per side, but my battery has a continuous 150a, and that's 5kw in total based on 50v
[2022-10-21T19:42:27] Mirono escooters: Well yes. If wrong shunt values are used :) But that happens little. Flipsky did once change shunts mid production so that was something to remember when flashing
[2022-10-21T19:42:40] Mirono escooters: I think you are calculating with phase amps?
[2022-10-21T19:43:18] Unknown: Yes when I say motor amps I mean phase amps, sorry wrong terminology
[2022-10-21T19:44:34] Mirono escooters: No no correct
[2022-10-21T19:44:42] Mirono escooters: But calculate kw with batt amps not phase
[2022-10-21T19:52:03] Unknown: See, that's interesting this is a long story but I'll try make it short short short; i bought a vesc, makerx dv4, based on 4.20 arch, on first use, I wasn't getting much power through, I was going at 80/90 amp phase, 45 motor, and the power just wasn't there, did a lot of troubleshooting around the throttle remote controller, checked wiring, soldering etc, battery was very good, p42 molicell 12s5p, lots of amps, but no initial torque, just very weak. Then I update the FW, and all of a sudden 50 amp phase, 30 battery, and the board was popping wheelies, alongside drv and abs errors like no tomorrow, eventually blew the caps. When I spoke to the manufacturer, they apologized telling me that that very esc should have a custom fw due to different resistors being used. When I put the fw he sent me and replaced the caps, i was back at square one, weak, eventually drv gave up and POP, and they refunded me, now I have a 6 version from them and it has been very solid, but I keep living with this doubt that my vescs amps are not the same as for example a focbox unity amps,
[2022-10-21T19:52:12] Unknown: Sugar I wrote a lot
[2022-10-21T19:52:51] Unknown: Does vesc tool calculate them with battery amps or phase?
[2022-10-21T19:53:07] Mirono escooters: 99% of times it shouldn't happen :)
[2022-10-21T19:53:11] Mirono escooters: Batt
[2022-10-21T19:53:22] Mirono escooters: You dont calculate kw with phase
[2022-10-21T19:53:34] Mirono escooters: Since if you would do it with phase voltage and current , it would be same
[2022-10-21T19:53:39] Mirono escooters: Hard explanation phase vs batt
[2022-10-21T19:54:15] Unknown: Vesc is telling me I pull 6.5 per side, the figure comes from the app, not my own calculation
[2022-10-21T19:54:27] Mirono escooters: Kw?
[2022-10-21T19:54:28] Unknown: Maybe is referring to peak power
[2022-10-21T19:54:33] Mirono escooters: Yes surely possible
[2022-10-21T19:54:35] Unknown: 6.5 lw
[2022-10-21T19:54:37] Unknown: Kw
[2022-10-21T19:55:45] Unknown: My understanding is that the phase amps reduce with the increase of voltage which is the result of rpm increase,
[2022-10-21T19:56:03] Unknown: So totally get what you mean
[2022-10-21T19:56:16] Mirono escooters: Correct :)
[2022-10-21T19:57:38] Unknown: You refer to the "'fake amps thing"?
[2022-10-21T19:57:55] Mirono escooters: Hes
[2022-10-21T19:57:56] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-10-21T19:58:11] Unknown: Ius there a way to test it.,
[2022-10-21T19:58:25] Mirono escooters: Smart bms or shunt to measure
[2022-10-21T19:59:28] Unknown: Smart bms can't work since I'm hardwired and my bms outlet is an xt60, the bms itself couldn't handle more than 60a so that could affect the results
[2022-10-21T19:59:37] Unknown: What's the second one, shunt to measure
[2022-10-21T19:59:46] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_6505@21-10-2022_19-59-46.jpg>
[2022-10-21T19:59:54] Mirono escooters: Funny enough i searched it today for friend
[2022-10-21T20:00:27] Unknown: Uh, you'd put that on the phase wires?
[2022-10-21T20:00:34] Mirono escooters: Vatt
[2022-10-21T20:00:36] Mirono escooters: Batt
[2022-10-21T20:00:53] Unknown: Gotcha,
[2022-10-21T20:03:44] Unknown: Another question, last one I promise
[2022-10-21T20:04:25] Unknown: Surron, theyr motor is 2.9kw, my 2 flipsky are 3.5each,
[2022-10-21T20:04:34] Unknown: Surron is a lot more powerful than my eskate
[2022-10-21T20:05:03] Mirono escooters: Bigger magnets motor
[2022-10-21T20:05:14] Unknown: Is this because flipsky gives peak kw and sur ron gives continuos kwnrating?
[2022-10-21T20:05:33] Mirono escooters: Thats also possible. Depends on fw setup
[2022-10-21T20:05:50] Unknown: So the reality is your can throw a lot more than 3kw at it
[2022-10-21T20:05:58] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-10-21T20:06:46] Unknown: Probably a spintend or any high voltage vesc is not a bad idea for me eh
[2022-10-21T20:07:23] Mirono escooters: Yes :)
[2022-10-21T20:07:24] Unknown: Or is the flipsky 75100 even more powerful
[2022-10-21T20:07:35] Mirono escooters: 180a phase we do
[2022-10-21T20:07:45] Unknown: On the fs?
[2022-10-21T20:07:51] Unknown: Battery?
[2022-10-21T20:08:01] Mirono escooters: Phase
[2022-10-21T20:08:12] Unknown: That will capsize my drift trike
[2022-10-21T20:08:24] Unknown: How much you set for battery
[2022-10-21T20:08:46] Mirono escooters: Im at 60/200a on makerx
[2022-10-21T20:09:15] Unknown: 60b 200ph?
[2022-10-21T20:09:18] Unknown: That's a lot
[2022-10-21T20:09:23] Unknown: Very good torque
[2022-10-21T20:09:40] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-10-21T20:09:43] Mirono escooters: Ebike go brr
[2022-10-21T20:09:47] Unknown: Which makerx and what's your voltage
[2022-10-21T20:09:55] Mirono escooters: Verified with BMS Bluetooth

[2022-10-21T20:10:29] Unknown: 200 phase is loads, that's a single vesc I'm assuming
[2022-10-21T20:10:35] Mirono escooters: Just overheats bcs bag . I got heatsink to mod
[2022-10-21T20:10:39] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-10-21T20:11:07] Unknown: That's basically the equivalent of flipsky 75100 right?
[2022-10-21T20:11:36] Mirono escooters: No
[2022-10-21T20:11:38] Mirono escooters: Better
[2022-10-21T20:11:48] Mirono escooters: Flipsky won't like 60/200
[2022-10-21T20:17:42] Unknown: Thanks, lots of useful informations, makerx probably is the best option at the moment
[2022-10-21T20:18:04] Mirono escooters: I like it

[2022-10-22T21:40:52] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Pmt are very good at cornering, much better than stock
[2022-10-22T21:40:55] S1m 0n: I would also like to travel that fast üòÑ
[2022-10-22T21:41:20] T·ëå·ñá·ó∑O·îï·ó©·îï·ëï·ïº: @roscheeee does make more top end with his vsett and 16s i mean.
[2022-10-22T21:41:39] S1m 0n: And 10" i think
[2022-10-22T21:41:45] T·ëå·ñá·ó∑O·îï·ó©·îï·ëï·ïº: Yes
[2022-10-22T21:42:00] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Because difference are motors itself, tires, weight
[2022-10-22T21:42:02] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Etc
[2022-10-22T21:42:08] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Also, thunder motors are low kv
[2022-10-22T21:42:13] T·ëå·ñá·ó∑O·îï·ó©·îï·ëï·ïº: I believe with my blade 90 is possible with 16s too
[2022-10-22T21:42:26] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: And the battery was at 54V sag here
[2022-10-22T21:42:46] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I mean, its not charged at all
[2022-10-22T21:42:51] T·ëå·ñá·ó∑O·îï·ó©·îï·ëï·ïº: Make mew Video full charged

[2022-10-22T21:44:23] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But accelerating is not even close to the latest dualtron or similar
[2022-10-22T21:44:50] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I mean, they are much slower
[2022-10-22T21:48:00] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Very happy with that project. Also @roscheeee and @AJAJ1992 have contributed in terms of consultations. You guys are rock
[2022-10-22T22:19:27] Luis Magalhaes: It can go more and without FW, my wolf with ubox and 16S was doing 101kmh uphill and 103kmh in same place downhill 70Ax2 batt and 220Ax2 motor no FW at that time
[2022-10-22T22:19:58] Luis Magalhaes: Its a similar setup but you have there a better battery üòÅ
[2022-10-22T22:30:31] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Different motors can be
[2022-10-22T22:31:05] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But ye, need to charge it
[2022-10-22T22:38:56] Luis Magalhaes: I think they are similar but dont know the cooper diameter

[2022-10-23T03:35:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Totally wrong how they goes to cool the controller
[2022-10-23T03:35:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: Thermal dissipation from their case is equal to 0
[2022-10-23T03:36:05] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yeah pirate has that
[2022-10-23T03:36:16] Rogerio Figueiredo: And if you gona tell him is wrong
[2022-10-23T03:36:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is gona wanna kick you
[2022-10-23T03:41:34] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is possible to make this build with 75100 and cool it down?
[2022-10-23T03:41:53] Rogerio Figueiredo: Vsn you guys share how you cool down yours?
[2022-10-23T03:44:37] Jan: Sounds like people with zero knowledge doing random shizzle as a how to tutorial to teach others, and when somebody points them out they get aggressive?
[2022-10-23T03:46:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Then continue to watch their video
[2022-10-23T03:46:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: And no helps from us xd
[2022-10-23T03:56:28] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yes
[2022-10-23T03:57:02] Rogerio Figueiredo: I just share is videos because there is no other video of mods on VESC
[2022-10-23T03:57:09] Rogerio Figueiredo: I don't like him either

[2022-10-23T19:53:50] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: flipsky as always
[2022-10-23T19:54:10] Mirono escooters: Lets blame water damage on Flipsky now?
[2022-10-23T20:49:44] Rogerio Figueiredo: Haha
[2022-10-23T20:50:06] Rogerio Figueiredo: What do you do do to cooldown Flipsky?
[2022-10-23T20:50:23] Mirono escooters: Bolt to frame
[2022-10-23T20:53:24] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is enough?
[2022-10-23T20:53:34] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-10-23T20:59:33] Rogerio Figueiredo: Maybe use some aluminum bar before?
[2022-10-23T21:05:05] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Use less details as possible. More thin as possible and right to air convection
[2022-10-23T21:14:04] Rogerio Figueiredo: Any pictures that I can see
[2022-10-23T21:16:06] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Fets > isolated thin as possible thermalpads > frame
[2022-10-23T21:16:22] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: This
[2022-10-23T21:19:22] Rogerio Figueiredo: How you isolate? Thermal tape
[2022-10-23T21:25:16] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: By thermalpads and plastic washer on screws
[2022-10-23T21:27:20] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You must not allow to short body of fets and frame
[2022-10-23T22:06:59] Rogerio Figueiredo: How mutch amps can I have ush trought 75100?
[2022-10-23T22:09:06] Thierry: I Screwed flipsky to aluminum base then screwed it to frame. I don't use lot of power but never get warm.

[2022-10-23T22:10:25] Rogerio Figueiredo: Thanks for sharing
[2022-10-23T22:10:45] Rogerio Figueiredo: What you call low power?
[2022-10-23T22:11:35] Thierry: 30A battery and 65A phase on each flipsky
[2022-10-23T22:11:44] Mirono escooters: Oh thats low
[2022-10-23T22:12:12] Thierry: Yes I have monorim motor üòÖ

[2022-10-23T22:14:26] Thierry: I just made it, 20s3p
[2022-10-23T22:15:35] Rogerio Figueiredo: You have the monorim with torque or tge speed?
[2022-10-23T22:16:06] Thierry: The old ones with torque
[2022-10-23T22:20:08] Rogerio Figueiredo: I have a speedy one
[2022-10-23T22:20:47] Rogerio Figueiredo: With stock controller and 20s 74kmh GPS
[2022-10-23T23:14:52] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Awesome. This looks very similar to what I have done! Well done.
[2022-10-23T23:26:05] Rogerio Figueiredo: Do you have the pictures

[2022-10-23T23:40:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: made for xiaomi mounting
[2022-10-23T23:43:03] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but ruined it with ubox single üòÖ
[2022-10-23T23:49:08] Rogerio Figueiredo: Very nice looking
[2022-10-23T23:49:23] Rogerio Figueiredo: What about the temps?
[2022-10-23T23:50:29] Rogerio Figueiredo: That is flipky 75100 to?
[2022-10-23T23:51:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes
[2022-10-23T23:52:01] Rogerio Figueiredo: But u use ubox on yours?
[2022-10-23T23:52:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes now, but it sucks.
[2022-10-23T23:52:38] Rogerio Figueiredo: Because of the temps?
[2022-10-23T23:52:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, Ubox temps suck. I tried improving it a little bit, which helped but still hitting 80¬∞C when trying to reach max speed.
[2022-10-23T23:53:19] Rogerio Figueiredo: And Flipsky is better?
[2022-10-23T23:53:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: A lot. Much better. Not as reliable as Ubox, but muuuch better temps especially with the HUASHUO MOSFETs that I used.
[2022-10-23T23:56:09] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: The only issue I had with Flipsky is that I frequently fried them due to BMS cut-outs (which I fixed afterwards) and once a board did not boot up anymore out of nowhere.
[2022-10-23T23:56:42] Rogerio Figueiredo: Oups that is not good
[2022-10-23T23:57:06] Rogerio Figueiredo: How many amps do you have
[2022-10-23T23:58:04] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: On my Ubox Single I am currently using 170A Phase w/ 80A battery amps.
[2022-10-23T23:58:35] Rogerio Figueiredo: What is strong
[2022-10-23T23:58:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: what
[2022-10-23T23:58:54] Rogerio Figueiredo: That*
[2022-10-23T23:58:59] Rogerio Figueiredo: Strong amps
[2022-10-23T23:59:18] Rogerio Figueiredo: I will use that mutch since I have a monorim motor
[2022-10-24T00:17:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: Try 120A phase and 85A battery, you will get better speed with less heat. Zero vector frequency 16khz and enable mtpa alghoritm, I think with 21s you can get 100kmh
[2022-10-24T00:23:35] Rogerio Figueiredo: Vsett more has a lot os speeed and power
[2022-10-24T00:23:41] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 16kHz check 120A phase for max speed tests 80A battery 22s 50-60kg driver maximum measured so far 88 km/h Ubox Single can't get faster, it will overheat before u even reach 80A of battery power, so power is not the limiting factor.
[2022-10-24T00:25:28] Rogerio Figueiredo: 60kg
[2022-10-24T00:25:39] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is nice door speed I have 100kg
[2022-10-24T00:25:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I am 120kg, but still managed to get to 85km/h.
[2022-10-24T00:26:03] Rogerio Figueiredo: I can't compete with no one with my xiaomi
[2022-10-24T00:27:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Hopefully I get a better VESC soon, but for now I will have to be limited by the shitbox.
[2022-10-24T00:29:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: You need another motor bro
[2022-10-24T00:29:41] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: get focer
[2022-10-24T00:30:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: 120kg for single motor is so much lol
[2022-10-24T00:30:10] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: and dont use single uboxes
[2022-10-24T00:30:14] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: lol one motor
[2022-10-24T00:30:16] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: ok
[2022-10-24T00:30:39] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yeah that's why I will make another g30d with dual
[2022-10-24T00:30:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: Now I get, my test was with 18s, and no problem 85kmh gps with 80A/120A
[2022-10-24T00:31:49] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: will never use anything from Spintend again. Don't care if their dual shit works better, bad experience, not again.
[2022-10-24T00:32:02] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: ubox dual are good only
[2022-10-24T00:33:14] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: We are using right now 75v version with 200a phase and 120A battery rear and 120A phase 90 battery front
[2022-10-24T00:33:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: On ubox dual you don‚Äôt see the real temperature that mosfet is
[2022-10-24T00:33:34] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Literally no problem, Temps no more than 60
[2022-10-24T00:34:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ubox single v1 75v has same issue
[2022-10-24T00:34:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Good cooling is your friend
[2022-10-24T00:34:30] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: always
[2022-10-24T00:34:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: When I see 50 degree ubox get immediately fire
[2022-10-24T00:34:44] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: me dont
[2022-10-24T00:35:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yah but that‚Äôs is to let you know the temperature sensor design is bad , in the fact they fixed in the newest version
[2022-10-24T00:35:36] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: yes, we have newer one
[2022-10-24T00:35:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: 100A x 2 J?
[2022-10-24T00:36:21] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I will wait for the CCC VESC project and if that works out on my pro2 build my dual g30 with it.
[2022-10-24T00:37:10] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: If not I'll get Little Foccer or 2x Flipsky 75100 Alu PCB
[2022-10-24T00:37:11] Rogerio Figueiredo: Wjag is your wight?
[2022-10-24T00:47:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: 80
[2022-10-24T00:48:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: 75200 alu pcb
[2022-10-24T00:49:36] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yeah or maybe 75200 but could be difficult to fit in, depends on how much space I can get out of it.

[2022-10-24T15:52:15] S1m 0n: Why u not use m365 too ?I think the Bluetooth is also only available through camible

[2022-10-24T15:54:52] üçâQuartziiüçâ/ü¶åZaqü¶å/ü¶äArakkiü¶ä @NFC@EF29: I'll try to flash ble 555
[2022-10-24T15:55:38] S1m 0n: I do not know. I no longer have an m365, but I read in the group from time to time. I thought because the dash works, the bluetooth would also work
[2022-10-24T16:00:17] Luis Magalhaes: I was thinking about the same but didn't know if i will say shit so shut up üòÇ
[2022-10-24T16:00:53] Luis Magalhaes: You should be able to conect from vesc tools on Bluetooth right?

[2022-10-24T16:10:54] Mirono escooters: No
[2022-10-24T16:20:14] Luis Magalhaes: Don't like vesc without Bluetooth üòÇ that app is the best dashboard
[2022-10-24T16:20:39] üçâQuartziiüçâ/ü¶åZaqü¶å/ü¶äArakkiü¶ä @NFC@EF29: Jup,.I'll probably buy a vesc 75100 for it with the Bluetooth module
[2022-10-24T16:29:00] Luis Magalhaes: Its a good way to go
[2022-10-24T23:34:41] Newuser G: Guys Rion throttle can work with vesc? And if yes, where I can buy it? üôè

[2022-10-26T06:03:08] sombre_enfant: Wich factory does the cnc parts? What tolerance u need on size?
[2022-10-26T09:24:36] Jan: Its about 2x from the rated current üëå
[2022-10-26T09:54:41] Federico77: I understand, so an 80A holds 160A, manil bms is a smarth bms or a bms without communication?
[2022-10-26T09:55:21] Jan: You can have it with bluetooth
[2022-10-26T10:52:16] rosheee: ry guys me hospital nto atm
[2022-10-26T11:37:57] Mirono escooters: Tf
[2022-10-26T11:37:59] Mirono escooters: U ded?
[2022-10-26T12:07:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Any who uses this in a case is üôà
[2022-10-26T12:08:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I already told him,he doesnt reply to me anymore üòÖ
[2022-10-26T12:11:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Kinda nice if this shape fits yours body
[2022-10-26T12:11:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I mean cable management by that
[2022-10-26T12:12:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: <photos/photo_6524@26-10-2022_12-12-46.jpg>
[2022-10-26T12:16:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I usually make similar holders, this is like 1,2 cm thick, not sure of name of the alu type , it's used for stage builds , pretty good for heat that's why you can weld it with AVI, cools back really fast
[2022-10-26T12:18:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If you like i can tell you about how it performs in a t29
[2022-10-26T12:18:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But even body was hardly moded
[2022-10-26T12:20:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Anyway that keeps cool 90 batt amps and 120 phase , Only time it get hot is 10 minutes uphill,on a 60% long uphill what was around 80c than
[2022-10-26T12:28:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: On 16 s 60a daly he ask atleast 120 üòÖ
[2022-10-26T12:31:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Probably long story ,hard to be Rs
[2022-10-26T12:35:23] Jan: Gueti besserig !
[2022-10-26T12:37:22] Rogerio Figueiredo: This is nice can you share the build
[2022-10-26T13:03:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: abs+alu or full alu üòâ
[2022-10-26T13:21:57] Thierry: Yes it does and even without spacer on m365 pro but would prohably be hard to sort cables. I have a 25mm spacer that contains 20s3p.
[2022-10-26T13:24:38] Mirono escooters: Full alu better doe
[2022-10-26T13:24:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I am willing to share information ,but few pictures wont tell all stuff what's made , like for this model we hardly modifyed whole , like main pole has solid insert from a steel ,so you whole stem is different, folding mechanism is strongened ,all bolts changed to proper strong ones even with size changes
[2022-10-26T13:26:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I show you something near simple awd i made with xiaomi esc's ,the way they sit is interesting for you, this way you get lot space in the middle
[2022-10-26T13:27:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: <video_file>
[2022-10-26T13:31:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If you take a closer look , blocks made to sit in the frame and than bridged heat , these contollers you see were just for building time not the final ones , could not stress this above 50 c anything you do , but this only does 55 kmh , but for xiaomi that's far than enough on tiny xuanchengs
[2022-10-26T13:33:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, bit i think it will block wifi & bluetooth communications üòµ‚Äçüí´
[2022-10-26T13:33:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also what you wont see on any pics that Before instalion all heat surfaces polished to mirror
[2022-10-26T13:33:47] Mirono escooters: Oempf
[2022-10-26T13:33:50] Mirono escooters: Antenna outside?
[2022-10-26T13:33:54] Mirono escooters: üòÖüòÖüòÖ
[2022-10-26T13:34:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: One side is screen
[2022-10-26T13:34:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Not aluüòè
[2022-10-26T13:34:34] Mirono escooters: ü§î
[2022-10-26T13:34:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Tell signal to go that way ü§£
[2022-10-26T13:36:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Bt modul what @PaoloWu sells or sold earlier easy reaches out from a laotie closed body , what's way more thick than this case and closed all sides ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ i think this will be able also
[2022-10-26T13:36:19] Thierry: Before I switched to flipsky I used to install original esc on a similar way but facing each other to fit without spacer
[2022-10-26T13:37:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Maybe limits how far ,but it should work
[2022-10-26T13:38:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Battery was there already from prevorius build of the owner
[2022-10-26T13:38:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But i get you ,but kinda no reason for awd if you dont have power to feed it ,i mean small or stock battery
[2022-10-26T13:40:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also separeted way or more surface gives you better heatbridge in the end if the day
[2022-10-26T13:41:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like on a build like this above, i could rewire esc temp cables to be temp sensor cables for engine's what i could monitor with xiaomi app, instead of controllers temp what i already know, that wont have a problem
[2022-10-26T13:42:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Or with Xiaogen or cami to have it on screen
[2022-10-26T13:43:31] Thierry: I made the previous build an it has evolved a lot since I bought it. Before manufacturing my 20s3p I had 2x10s and 2x6s in serie to supply both motors. With monorim monorim motor I don't really need lot of amps, 2x30A is already too much for monorim
[2022-10-26T13:43:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also i have fancier plan where you can even cool these type of mosfets even better,but never has time to play with such a thing nowdays
[2022-10-26T13:44:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: To be honest i saw more Monorim motors burnt than working ones
[2022-10-26T13:45:26] Thierry: On single kptor config I agree but awd is pretty robust at low power üòÇ
[2022-10-26T13:45:47] Thierry: I'm looking for better motor that can be fitted on rear pro2 frame
[2022-10-26T13:46:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: The build above has 2*350 w on 13s and gets like 55 a in rabbit ,not totally sure how much is that in batt A 13sp13 Internal+ external
[2022-10-26T13:46:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Without suspension ,i guess
[2022-10-26T13:47:08] Thierry: Yes but not possible as far as I now
[2022-10-26T13:47:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Ali 350 is faster but if you do nothing to cool it and endless maximum,you will melt isolations
[2022-10-26T13:47:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Limited by engine's
[2022-10-26T13:48:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: G30 frame lot more options
[2022-10-26T13:49:18] Thierry: I know but had to know it 2 years ago üòÖ
[2022-10-26T13:49:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Or sell this and get another
[2022-10-26T13:50:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Some pplüòÖ keep just getting new stuff and than has 4-5 scootersü§£
[2022-10-26T13:51:24] Thierry: Yeah but g30 are expensive and I just finished my battery pack which fit my pro2
[2022-10-26T13:52:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well i cant say its an easy one, depends on $ and addiction lvlüòÖ
[2022-10-26T13:53:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I cant say i am rich but talented in way and very addicted ü§£
[2022-10-26T13:54:16] Rogerio Figueiredo: Very nice
[2022-10-26T13:54:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And i like some big and small also Like there is some nice stuff in bigger body scoots,like the space you have for your stuff
[2022-10-26T13:54:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But also there is nothing like
[2022-10-26T13:57:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: When you go to a Scooter meetup with a small sleeper , what's a hidden madafaka And do wheelspins while keeping up the speed of others rolling together The hate lvl you get is so sweat ü§£ i mean you ashame lot ppl with $$$$$$$$ price scooters
[2022-10-26T13:59:14] Thierry: Yes I agree but it's not like wife, I cannot leave my pro2 and find a younger one üòÇ
[2022-10-26T13:59:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What i suspected in common, the most of the biggest price scoots owned by noobs or daddy rich etc and they are pretty much assholes around here ,( near this there are cool ppl also)
[2022-10-26T14:01:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also last years scooter Meetup was fun only guy felt was with nami , it was Really noobs a like ,i mean 400 Other ppl went same way üòÖ
[2022-10-26T14:02:16] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what does it mean ?
[2022-10-26T14:02:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, but installation can be tricky (ipex connector...)
[2022-10-26T14:03:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: sandwitch : glass - screen - alu front case - alu or abs back case
[2022-10-26T14:03:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well just tell you scooter that she will have another ho near her ü§£ Harem mod ,but this how you end up with 5-7 scooters
[2022-10-26T14:04:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's why i ordered full all to. to be able to test
[2022-10-26T14:04:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I ment that's a cheap bt solution, what works easy over 5mm alu
[2022-10-26T14:05:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So your should be good
[2022-10-26T14:05:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i hope üòÅ
[2022-10-26T14:05:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I think in any scenario
[2022-10-26T14:06:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also imagine xiaomi or ninebot screen, all sits in an alu body ,they work cool
[2022-10-26T14:07:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well you will test out i guess
[2022-10-26T14:07:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But i kinda bet you will have zero issues with this
[2022-10-26T14:39:39] Thierry: Then it is my wife who sill leave if I have 6 scooters in living room üòÇ
[2022-10-26T15:16:04] Mirono escooters: Wifes are temporary Scooters are forever
[2022-10-26T15:22:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Does she hate scooters? Or not really a fan of it ?
[2022-10-26T15:26:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I mean if you can bring her into the fun, you have less to worry about,i dont mean to get her some beast but something, what's dedicated to her ,maybe a paintjob to pinkü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2022-10-26T15:27:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Alsoü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ nowdays some ppl merry Stupid things like a dog ,can of beans ,so there is Always a chance to merry your scoot and live happily afterüòÇ

[2022-10-26T15:33:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well we usually have one bigger meetup once an year ,i live in Budapest,Hungary
[2022-10-26T15:34:16] Rogerio Figueiredo: I like that to but the money you spend on the project is more some time then a good scooter
[2022-10-26T15:36:03] Mirono escooters: You miss the point The project is a good scooter
[2022-10-26T15:36:05] Mirono escooters: Actually better

[2022-10-26T16:54:54] Mirono escooters: Well, "possible" Since any brushless esc is possible brushed
[2022-10-26T16:55:10] Mirono escooters: But i dont think vedder ever even considered And this shit isnt worth it
[2022-10-26T16:55:48] Luis Magalhaes: What were you thinking of use as a brushed motor?
[2022-10-26T16:56:16] Mirono escooters: Its a old motorbicycle modded to electric
[2022-10-26T16:56:29] Luis Magalhaes: Thats like the 90`s scooters that come brushed hehe
[2022-10-26T16:56:31] Mirono escooters: Its not worth it/i couldnt weld aluminium/i had it laying around :)
[2022-10-26T16:56:35] Mirono escooters: Indeed
[2022-10-26T16:57:17] Luis Magalhaes: Put it on a brushless mid motor üòÇ
[2022-10-26T16:57:59] Mirono escooters: Couldnt weld that
[2022-10-26T16:58:11] Mirono escooters: I've directly welded the motor to frame, kinda pitty
[2022-10-26T16:58:35] Mirono escooters: Maybe later but then id need to put it somewhere super custom or some big mounting plate and for now its all a test
[2022-10-26T16:58:52] Mirono escooters: Some projects are good as is without too much overkill

[2022-10-26T18:23:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Frame would turn into gold just by time and keeping it in a good shape
[2022-10-26T18:24:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like a rusty old stey car body with lot missing parts by Rothing is like 2000 euros

[2022-10-26T18:27:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Did you ever open an engine like that? Its kinda fun from the inside also will be dirty as Hell
[2022-10-26T18:29:11] Face de Pin Suc√©: I would go for a Dualtron second hand clearly if price is a big matter
[2022-10-26T18:32:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What Type you suggest? also seen few dualtrons neck broken ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ what about that ?
[2022-10-26T18:33:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Price matters if you get some shit for Higher price and still have to improve a lot feels even worse maybe
[2022-10-26T18:33:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Butü§î
[2022-10-26T18:35:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: To explain my self It's nice thing that scooters are foldable but after an amount of power it's not the best idea
[2022-10-26T18:36:18] Mirono escooters: The weight isn't even practical
[2022-10-26T18:41:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also what i hate ,i could say, as they join front and rear parts on lot scooters like the one who "invented" that idea was bad at lego evenüòÖ
[2022-10-26T18:42:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Maybe this only comes up from my metal head ,but i look inside and i could cry sometimes üòÖ

[2022-10-27T11:59:28] J√°nos T√≥th: Hi. I experimented with the smartESC V2, comolied my own version, changed in the product folder the max ABS current, but after flashing, in the vesc tool, if I put my ABS current above 100, it throws instantly ABS overcurrent fault. And if I incrieas it above 210A, than its gone, but gut triggered easely. Seems like an overflow thing. What did I forget to do?
[2022-10-27T12:18:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: wrong group to talk about smartesc üòâ
[2022-10-27T12:23:54] J√°nos T√≥th: Accidentü§≠

[2022-10-27T13:14:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Far as i remember he changed to iPhone, Than replies slowed than turned to zero ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ saying this according to my own messages
[2022-10-27T13:16:25] S1m 0n: I didn't know anything about a phone change, but I can also confirm this behavior

[2022-10-27T13:19:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Maybe he just super busy and iphoneü§£
[2022-10-27T13:21:45] S1m 0n: It may be that he is busy, but I also have deadlines that I have to meet and sending someone information after it has already been postponed twice is certainly not too much to ask
[2022-10-27T14:10:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well my chat's with him just friendly, not business

[2022-10-28T17:44:21] Rogerio Figueiredo: I never tried vesc before
[2022-10-28T17:45:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Motor diag
[2022-10-28T17:46:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I cant say that ,ask @PaoloWu
[2022-10-28T17:55:22] Rogerio Figueiredo: When is here maybe he help me out
[2022-10-28T17:55:47] Rogerio Figueiredo: On Flipsky what are the diferences between 75100 and 75200
[2022-10-28T17:58:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: Much better
[2022-10-28T18:00:41] Rogerio Figueiredo: So I should quit of waiting for Flipsky 75100 and get this clone of clone 75200?
[2022-10-28T18:04:11] Luis Magalhaes: 75200 has more motor amps, dont know if you will use it with your motor üòÖ
[2022-10-28T18:04:24] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse let it smoke
[2022-10-28T18:04:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Maybe that has phase filtering also?
[2022-10-28T18:04:47] Luis Magalhaes: It cools better if you use low amps?
[2022-10-28T18:05:06] Luis Magalhaes: That i dont know
[2022-10-28T18:05:21] Rogerio Figueiredo: I have a a poor motor
[2022-10-28T18:05:27] Mirono escooters: Problably
[2022-10-28T18:05:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well hard one ,coz different scenario would end different
[2022-10-28T18:05:34] Rogerio Figueiredo: But maybe I change in future
[2022-10-28T18:05:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like normal road flat drives less heat ,but to climb a big hill
[2022-10-28T18:06:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Unsure you would not fry engine's
[2022-10-28T18:06:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What's poor?
[2022-10-28T18:06:54] Luis Magalhaes: I think the 75100 is enough for the amps you want, but dont know if theres is something else that makes it better then
[2022-10-28T18:07:20] Luis Magalhaes: Monorim
[2022-10-28T18:07:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What motor he has ?
[2022-10-28T18:07:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Ohh
[2022-10-28T18:07:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Now i get you ü§£
[2022-10-28T18:07:43] Mirono escooters: Yea lets not do over 80phase on dat
[2022-10-28T18:07:51] Mirono escooters: It doesnt deserve more
[2022-10-28T18:08:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well motor diag would tell what she measures for it
[2022-10-28T18:08:49] Rogerio Figueiredo: This is not 75200 is only 75100 v2
[2022-10-28T18:08:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also do you smoke? @marine_tugah
[2022-10-28T18:09:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Coz after you burn it, you can make nice ashtray
[2022-10-28T18:09:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Just joking üòÖüòÅ

[2022-10-28T18:10:44] Rogerio Figueiredo: I for know I have that motor in the future I can change it maybe
[2022-10-28T18:10:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well both has enough power to burn it soü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2022-10-28T18:11:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I would may say , meanwhile you order ,order thicker engine cabling,that will fail first
[2022-10-28T18:11:40] Rogerio Figueiredo: So the question where is 75100 Flipsky vs 75100 V2 makerboard @PaoloWu?
[2022-10-28T18:12:50] Luis Magalhaes: @PaoloWu gogogo üòÇüí™
[2022-10-28T18:13:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: They says it‚Äôs the same
[2022-10-28T18:13:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: So idk
[2022-10-28T18:13:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well We know more about the smaller, also his answer is not for the brand you show
[2022-10-28T18:14:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I would try it ,but also would open it up at first moment i get my hands on itüòÅ
[2022-10-28T18:19:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Let's go in it a bit If you would get single 75100 ,you would need a Custom mount a box is a joke
[2022-10-28T18:20:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: With this you show you have some chance
[2022-10-28T18:21:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also i would say get there button also to be able to swich on off ,since its your First
[2022-10-28T18:22:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Compared with flipsky 75200 ,just in price you go double ,while it knows more ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2022-10-28T18:25:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: @Mirono_escooters you said something you know the brand already?
[2022-10-28T18:35:53] Mirono escooters: Yea
[2022-10-28T18:35:56] Mirono escooters: Always copies flipsky
[2022-10-28T18:41:29] Rogerio Figueiredo: II have a 3d touch to my 3 printer from them
[2022-10-28T19:00:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: ü§î üòÖ well ,there is nothing we can loose if you try it

[2022-10-29T20:17:08] rosheee: Had 100kmh 105 kmh peak
[2022-10-29T20:17:18] rosheee: <3
[2022-10-29T20:17:54] rosheee: Sry for delay I used 60a daly but the 60A i use atm can push less amps than the older version
[2022-10-29T20:18:00] rosheee: Old version 200A peak no prob
[2022-10-29T20:18:07] rosheee: New 130-150A cont

[2022-10-29T20:37:28] Oliver Eliasson: What temps are safe for motor without ff? My temp sensor is also not accurate but on good side. Shows 35C¬∞ in 22C¬∞ room. But now it start to limit power at 85c and reach that pretty fast if pushing it. Can i set 90-95 degree limit without damaging anything?
[2022-10-29T20:41:36] Artem Bulashev: M Temp protection start 90, end 105
[2022-10-29T20:42:13] Artem Bulashev: With FF Start 75 / end 85 (80-90 will be pushing it to the magnets loosing charge zone, unless you know what magnets are used)
[2022-10-29T20:56:35] S1m 0n: My engine has recently had slight traces of rust. i removed it when i put ferrorfluid in it. since ferrorfluid is oil-based, shouldn't it also protect against new rust?!
[2022-10-29T20:56:46] rosheee: fack the temp
[2022-10-29T20:57:05] rosheee: my rear 20s motor goes super retard fuckeria overboosted nutz
[2022-10-29T20:57:15] rosheee: at some point it begins to sounds not healthy
[2022-10-29T20:57:21] rosheee: but as soon it cools down it works again
[2022-10-29T20:57:26] rosheee: i wanna push it until it makes poff
[2022-10-29T20:57:32] rosheee: but not possible until now damn
[2022-10-29T20:57:37] S1m 0n: Most what u do sounds not healthy üòÇ
[2022-10-29T20:57:43] rosheee: quality shit motor still living
[2022-10-29T20:58:08] rosheee: i check le logs now
[2022-10-29T20:58:10] rosheee: 25km max b00st
[2022-10-29T21:00:18] rosheee: <photos/photo_6538@29-10-2022_21-00-18.jpg>
[2022-10-29T21:00:57] Artem Bulashev: It doesn‚Äôt creat coating residue, so it should not I think, not sure
[2022-10-29T21:01:28] rosheee: omfg rion gets abs over current now
[2022-10-29T21:02:42] rosheee: and le fuck daly bms 60A new version max 150A and 125cont.
[2022-10-29T21:05:18] S1m 0n: when I took the engine out again later, ferrous fluid was already spread everywhere.. or did I put too much in?
[2022-10-29T21:06:11] S1m 0n: I didn't even have to press the tweezers, the magnets pulled the ferrofluid out by themselves üòÇ
[2022-10-29T21:06:24] Oliver Eliasson: Even with my faulty sensor? Will swap during winter
[2022-10-29T21:20:04] Mirono escooters: Abit
[2022-10-29T22:46:29] rosheee: why didn't used antirust?
[2022-10-29T22:57:04] Rogerio Figueiredo: Guys I question from a noob. Why vesc does not care about lights and turn off button? I know that power is the main thing we all want. But we nett the rest to
[2022-10-29T22:58:45] Rogerio Figueiredo: I'm just a noob guys that doesn't even have a vesc yet
[2022-10-29T23:22:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: You pull that on Tronic and didn't explode yet ?
[2022-10-29T23:22:59] rosheee: Nope
[2022-10-29T23:23:13] rosheee: But motor ..rear motor sounds sad xD
[2022-10-29T23:23:24] rosheee: Soon temp.sensor...xyd
[2022-10-29T23:23:28] rosheee: I think went over 100C
[2022-10-29T23:23:54] rosheee: I did 4 runs now 25km up down and straight hill
[2022-10-29T23:24:06] rosheee: Throttle as much as possible 100%
[2022-10-29T23:24:36] rosheee: Worst is when u accelerate out of a curve
[2022-10-29T23:24:47] rosheee: Front wheel spins and u 'drift' xD
[2022-10-29T23:25:00] rosheee: Added new pmt 120km ago..
[2022-10-29T23:25:14] rosheee: 1.5mm profile left on front 2m rear
[2022-10-29T23:26:13] rosheee: And trickstuff disc was best so far..but compared to brake stuff it is worst... Like Yugo GT brakes vs GT3R LMS
[2022-10-29T23:26:33] rosheee: Put brakestuff on 16S for daily test...the hotter it gets the harder it brakes
[2022-10-29T23:27:02] rosheee: Best
[2022-10-29T23:27:24] rosheee: And the new kool stop pads for mt5/7 are also best
[2022-10-29T23:27:28] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes amazing discs
[2022-10-29T23:27:33] Face de Pin Suc√©: But damn so expensive
[2022-10-29T23:27:35] rosheee: U want some @SibClimb ? But u use shimano
[2022-10-29T23:27:43] rosheee: U use differents
[2022-10-29T23:27:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: I use Shimano Saints
[2022-10-29T23:27:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: With ceramic pads
[2022-10-29T23:28:15] rosheee: Damn
[2022-10-29T23:28:23] rosheee: But u use the cheaper discs
[2022-10-29T23:28:29] rosheee: Not the punchout
[2022-10-29T23:29:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: I don't have same brakestuff disc ?
[2022-10-29T23:32:45] rosheee: Yes
[2022-10-29T23:32:50] rosheee: Show pic
[2022-10-29T23:33:00] rosheee: U have the cheaper and lighter i think
[2022-10-29T23:33:14] Face de Pin Suc√©: Maybe, I don't remember, don't have pic now
[2022-10-29T23:33:24] Face de Pin Suc√©: I'm in Fontainebleau, rock climbing trip

[2022-10-30T01:50:38] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-10-30T10:57:31] Artem Bulashev: Simply put it into fully boiling water to find out the offset and than account for it
[2022-10-30T10:58:16] Artem Bulashev: Never put duty cycle above 95% on vesc
[2022-10-30T12:02:46] Quinn Foster: yeah you might meet GOD then
[2022-10-30T15:54:11] Face de Pin Suc√©: It was with 4.12
[2022-10-30T15:54:20] Face de Pin Suc√©: Now you can run 99% duty no problem
[2022-10-30T16:01:17] Mirono escooters: Rlly?
[2022-10-30T19:03:32] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, I rode a lot with 99% duty x)
[2022-10-30T19:04:43] Mirono escooters: OwO
[2022-10-30T19:04:48] Mirono escooters: Any vesc? What improvement
[2022-10-30T22:21:48] Cass: Rode with 98% also without problem ü§®
[2022-10-30T22:28:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, back when I used 15s it was fine with 99% duty. Now doesn't matter anyway.
[2022-10-30T22:28:22] Mirono escooters: What improvements
[2022-10-30T22:30:15] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It increases top speed a little bit.
[2022-10-30T22:30:51] Mirono escooters: And power?
[2022-10-30T22:31:00] Mirono escooters: If i remember right from electronics school lol
[2022-10-30T22:32:01] Konstantin: 99% duty 2000+ km, all ok
[2022-10-30T23:18:55] Artem Bulashev: 4% top speed increase ?
[2022-10-30T23:19:29] Artem Bulashev: Good info! Didn‚Äôt know
[2022-10-30T23:19:36] Artem Bulashev: 100% no no right?
[2022-10-30T23:20:49] Luis Magalhaes: Dont be greedy üòÇ
[2022-10-30T23:26:59] Artem Bulashev: Just wondering hah
[2022-10-30T23:27:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: Duty cycle is basically your throttle
[2022-10-30T23:29:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: 100% you have risk goes out of rpm, if anyone of you have xiaomi you will know. When you reach max speed it will start brake
[2022-10-30T23:36:08] Luis Magalhaes: I know i was just messing with you ü§£
[2022-10-31T03:30:46] Rogerio Figueiredo: Guys what do you think about JBD bms?
[2022-10-31T04:31:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Isn't JBD LLT?
[2022-10-31T09:23:52] Konstantin: 99% rebrand, inside+soft 1:1
[2022-10-31T15:20:34] Rogerio Figueiredo: Ia good on no good m
[2022-10-31T21:51:48] S1m 0n: do other Hall sensors in the motor make themselves felt? I have from the factory, 61A.. now wanted to order 41F and then read;
[2022-10-31T21:52:02] S1m 0n: 3144 hall, mainly for low-power motors below 1000w, with relatively low sensing sensitivity, low price and low cost, mainly for the electric vehicle maintenance market. 41F Hall is mainly used for low-power motors below 1000w. It has moderate sensing sensitivity, relatively stable performance, high cost performance and economical advantages. It is mainly supplied to electric vehicle manufacturers and one of the major suppliers of hall elements in the electric vehicle maintenance market. 43F Hall, with good sensing sensitivity and stable performance, is mostly used in electric tricycles from 800w to 2000w, and a small number of them are used in electric two-wheel vehicles and four-wheel vehicles. 413 hall, high sensing sensitivity, faster response, superior performance, high temperature resistance, working temperature -40-150 ¬∞ C, suitable for high-power motors and low-power motors.
[2022-10-31T21:53:31] S1m 0n: 413 is said to be best, but does a faster response time do anything?
[2022-11-01T00:22:13] Mirono escooters: Felt?
[2022-11-01T00:22:20] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-11-01T10:35:32] S1m 0n: a noticeable difference, or only on paper ?
[2022-11-01T11:11:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: After 20kmh normally is no more used hall

[2022-11-01T12:20:23] Mirono escooters: Lol me at like 5
[2022-11-01T12:27:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: That means you have low Kv motor
[2022-11-01T12:28:44] Mirono escooters: Ye
[2022-11-01T12:32:19] S1m 0n: Thanks
[2022-11-01T13:00:15] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: that can't be a reason cuz the VESC have Max and Min voltage cutoff, so the battery can cut the voltage will increase and the ESC will stop the commutation and stay safe
[2022-11-01T13:01:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs easily overcurrent
[2022-11-01T13:02:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: 450A abs on this design is absolutely extreme
[2022-11-01T13:10:24] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: at how much current it break ?
[2022-11-01T13:14:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think the maximum safe absolute current limit is 300A
[2022-11-01T13:14:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is very much 450 for single fet design, 12awg cable and those tracks
[2022-11-01T13:16:52] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: you talking about wish controller ?
[2022-11-01T13:17:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: 75100 flipsky
[2022-11-01T13:17:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: Based on 6 TOLL fets
[2022-11-01T13:19:10] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Ah, no you are crazy, just by the mosfet it's something like 250A 300Abs but i can be limited more by the track, caps, how the mosfet is drived etc ...
[2022-11-01T13:20:30] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: and at this current it's only on dynamic, at that current you broke the mosfet if you do full throttle at 0 speed with brake
[2022-11-01T13:23:19] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it's more 200A 250Abs the real max settings to dont break it
[2022-11-01T13:29:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2022-11-01T13:29:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: But not mineüòÇ

[2022-11-01T13:50:03] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yes ok, so it's normal it's die
[2022-11-01T13:50:25] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it's not like that we config a VESC
[2022-11-01T13:51:08] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Abs dont have to be more than 10~15% of the Motor current Max, and if you trigg the Abs it's because your others settings is wrong
[2022-11-01T13:53:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: LOL
[2022-11-01T13:54:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Can‚Äôt do this even on a 12fet üòÇ
[2022-11-01T13:58:56] asyan4ik: These were tests to see what he could do before he died. Now I know his limit.

[2022-11-01T14:06:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: Are good huayi mosfet?
[2022-11-01T14:08:40] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: for the one with 3 mos yes for the two Mosfets one no it's OI 1.2/1.5A I think it's not enough... but it's not my conception, I just buy make test and feedback and try to increasing the things, but actually too much mistake...
[2022-11-01T14:08:43] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yes
[2022-11-01T14:10:05] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: on my Spinted I ride at 220A 250abs it's more or less fine, but if you do full throttle with brake it die

[2022-11-01T14:11:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs the fet with lowest Rdson in the market I think, even less than the top of ONSEMI FDBL series. So I don‚Äôt know if the HUAYI fet resistance spec is fake or onsemi one is fake ü§î
[2022-11-01T14:11:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: 220 motor current?üôÄ
[2022-11-01T14:13:06] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yeah, so actually I don't see better results with amazing 380 get than my classic on semi 300A to be honest, I burn lots of them with very less current than expected but it's can be cuz of the circuit not the mosfet, but I would like test them on my Spinted to have good comparaison
[2022-11-01T14:13:22] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yeah, since lots of months
[2022-11-01T14:14:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: My spintend single died at 250A xd , my fault :/
[2022-11-01T14:14:20] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yeah, it die at 250 you can't go at that level
[2022-11-01T14:14:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: In single motor
[2022-11-01T14:14:41] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: 200~220 it's fine will very very very big work on the cooler and it's not safe if the motor is blocked
[2022-11-01T14:15:14] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: you are crazy it's too much
[2022-11-01T14:15:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: Paid also 198$ üò§üò≠
[2022-11-01T14:15:53] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: even 200A it's fine if it's not long, after it's limited but the temperature (even with big cooling work)
[2022-11-01T14:15:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: One burnt at 110A phase, spintend says was overcurrent then no warranty
[2022-11-01T14:16:25] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yeah it's normal it's warranty for 100A...
[2022-11-01T14:16:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: <sticker>
[2022-11-01T14:16:50] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: if you decide to go upper than that it's not warranty it's make sense
[2022-11-01T14:17:37] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: we try to dev our esc also, if we win and sell it also we will refuse the warranty if customer don't use the product in the area its making for
[2022-11-01T14:19:07] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but 110A it's really not high xD you probably do a mistake somewhere else, like Abs too high with wrong parameters
[2022-11-01T14:19:14] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: or short circuit
[2022-11-01T14:19:18] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: I don't know
[2022-11-01T14:20:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes in the fact they are right, I no contested even more like other customersüòÇ
[2022-11-01T14:20:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: I know my fault
[2022-11-01T14:21:25] Mirono escooters: Im at 200 too on makerxü§∑
[2022-11-01T14:21:29] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yeah and also Spinted make very short margin, if they have to change one they pay for sell üòÇ
[2022-11-01T14:22:12] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: setting at 200 doesn't mean you go to 200 be careful about it üòÇ
[2022-11-01T14:22:28] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but yeah, it's possible makersx seem good conception
[2022-11-01T14:22:38] Mirono escooters: I watched log and real life data its 200 :)
[2022-11-01T14:22:44] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but less than Spinted for the power by mos observation
[2022-11-01T14:22:51] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: good üëç
[2022-11-01T14:22:56] Mirono escooters: Im happy with it Quick heat but ye 60/200 lol, i need mod heatsink

[2022-11-01T14:23:35] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: for compacity it's good, but yeah I don't like so much too
[2022-11-01T14:23:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is much delicated than other package
[2022-11-01T14:24:23] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yes sure it's more hard to remplace
[2022-11-01T14:24:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: We even wait at rage vesc
[2022-11-01T14:24:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: But still no infoüò§
[2022-11-01T14:25:05] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: haha...
[2022-11-01T14:25:26] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: actually nothing work as we expect
[2022-11-01T14:25:45] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but we sill work on that, find solution by cabinet of expert etc...
[2022-11-01T14:25:45] Artem Bulashev: Guys @S1m0n_420 sent intersting thing, after analyzing it I realized that with minimal modification to the pcb and minimal altering of the code we can get amazing device
[2022-11-01T14:25:58] Artem Bulashev: https://github.com/thankthemaker/rESCue
[2022-11-01T14:26:16] Artem Bulashev: Here is my analysis Based on this we could - repurpose led bar as wled blinkers by adding 3 pin connector for L and R buttons input (and changing trigger) or keep front and brake wled and add trigger and output for left right blink - repurpose buzzer to alarm (add armed mode into blynk app, with ebrake full up on movement ) (or one of normal light output can be used for alarm siren, freeing buzzer io) - uart is used to speak to display (display button used to turn on headlight over uart light) (can to vesc) - up on mode change message (1/2/3) push vesc parameter change over can ? May be possible (no need to store specific setting in eprom, just push specific message to set rpm limit 1 rpm limit 2 rpm limit 3) - than creat if command based on different triggers like (twice brake over 50%, + mode one, + mode hold sec) to send 9999 rpm limit = result is default police mode with quick and hard to guess unlock Best part is that all of that looks doable as speed calculation already known as per link above! Mode and light from display to cotnorller is not encrypted. Adc and brake go to vesc directly ‚Äî‚Äî- More over display has VBAT - after rfid unlock it send wake up to controlle, so we can use same line to wake up rESCue as it takes up to 75v Or we can wake it up with display and use rfid activation line as alarm on / off. - if rfid was not unlocked / no controller wake up signal but motion detected than alarm and controller is woken and ebrake max message sent for 5sec after no more movement (ebrake will over power adc by default), if rfid was unlock than operation as normal
[2022-11-01T14:27:29] Mirono escooters: We talking about what?
[2022-11-01T14:27:37] Artem Bulashev: Link in next message
[2022-11-01T14:31:41] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: the interesting things it's to have working high power esc first for my case üòÇ
[2022-11-01T14:34:46] Artem Bulashev: Code change for transcoding will need to be some, but vesc communication already there for throttle and brake, so adding an extra command for rpm limit in response to uart message is half way done it seems
[2022-11-01T14:38:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Our almost finished, if not for stock short
[2022-11-01T14:38:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: But lol 3 fet will be overkill
[2022-11-01T14:39:31] Mirono escooters: The one from badgineerüò≥üò≥
[2022-11-01T14:39:36] Artem Bulashev: This is so far most realistic starting point for 90% or what we want. Adding an accelerometer should be also ok as we don‚Äôt connect display directly but simply use uart to speak with one: More one Kaaba/qs-s4/zero all seem to be cross compatible enough for speed and mode 1/2/3 so it would work with any of those in theory using same code
[2022-11-01T14:42:53] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it's depend for what, you know we tester the 2 & 5 fets from HESC to be distributor in France, but for the moment it fail, Even the Big one (too big) it fail a 1/3 of power and never run the motor properly, but, he will send to us another revision with phase filter, it should be work better, the Small 2 fets work well but not as the power it making for, and also too much defaults on the conceptions, but ... maybe we will arrive at good product
[2022-11-01T14:45:07] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: after burn the oem origin fets I try to put mine toll on the pcb üòÇ it working only on Hall sensor commutation and I kill them quickly üòÇ but it's normal it's not optimized for it
[2022-11-01T15:25:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: Lol TOLL on 263 pads
[2022-11-01T15:26:20] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yeah, it can fit

[2022-11-01T15:31:57] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it's ESC making by Indien guy

[2022-11-02T09:44:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Seen 41f above 1000w ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ Also vesc turns to sensorless after 20 kmh or such , doesnt really get you anywhere changing them
[2022-11-02T09:52:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: There is several ways , already few of us was showing, you need to make a Custom mount , shitbox it comes with is a joke , you will have extreme high temps with that, also all depends on how it's build , the more weak heatbridge,the more heat you gain
[2022-11-02T10:00:49] S1m 0n: Found in a description of hall sensors at Ali Express
[2022-11-02T10:03:27] S1m 0n: is not special because of Vesc. I would like to use a Vsett controller in my Kaabo.. but now I found out that kaabo uses an angle of 120¬∞ and vsett 60¬∞.. the motor jerky because of that. So before I re-solder the Hall sensors, I wanted to get a replacement in case something breaks @Her0DasH
[2022-11-02T10:04:47] S1m 0n: but there are people in here who have a clue and may have already dealt with such things
[2022-11-02T10:23:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I get you
[2022-11-02T12:43:25] Artem Bulashev: Yes people with version 1 and who are not happy with it - apparently some people enjoy and daily drive batch1 even on 10+ vsett ‚Ä¶.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è guess we are all different. Will get discount to get gen2
[2022-11-02T12:51:07] Artem Bulashev: - implemented Software compensation for standard controllers that force you to have 0.1-0.2v of dead zone or they won‚Äôt boot up - redesigned magnet system in throttle to create linear response without 5 degree dead zone around neutral like it was on dual magnet system in batch 1 - new calibration of start point, 0.025v steps from 0.5-1.4 (shipped with 0.8v). And now it is relative, so you can go one step up or one step down without starting from 0 every time. Makes it super easy to get perfect result with in 2min (Same for end point calibration) - vesc do not need any of that of course but now Crusie button also wired in internally, so will work without any wiring or vesc or on standard controllers
[2022-11-02T13:37:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Nice, For my side basically spinner felt small, near this i am big guy ,but problems started When i was in gloves ,if they were not tight as fuck ,i didn't feel throttle I tried it with Vesc so calibration was not hard Cc button worked pretty smooth, other down side was cable lenght ,was a bit short
[2022-11-02T13:57:25] Artem Bulashev: How short ? (How much more needed ? )
[2022-11-02T13:58:18] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2022-11-02T14:01:17] Artem Bulashev: So not high spring tension but higher general motion resistance like on vsett trigger throttle (there is fair bit of plustic rubbing on it self so throttle doesn‚Äôt move from where you put it too easily
[2022-11-02T14:02:26] Artem Bulashev: Thanks for feed back will adjust cable length
[2022-11-02T14:16:46] Artem Bulashev: Gen2 has about 2x increase in useful motion range (after deadzone of batch1 and hard to get calibration) Physically it is 50% more throttle range = used to be 45 degrees (in reality only 35 degrees were used) , now 65 degrees will be huge improvement And regen break is 35 degrees. (Total 100 degrees motion now) with 120 degree magnet should make it extremely linear unlike batch 1 which was sharply exponential
[2022-11-02T14:21:05] Artem Bulashev: Intersting I was trying to minimize resistance - premium quality and all, even used high viscosity Lubricant inside to make it smoother. Batch 1 was rubbing the bottom case on red wheel especially. I wonder what creates high resistance on all cnc Rion- sounds like it‚Äôs a bag that because a feature üòÑüòÑ Maybe I should add a pair of Nylon screws that would put adjustable pressure onto the scroll wheel ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èhmm thanks for feed back
[2022-11-02T14:40:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: It was like 30cm missing
[2022-11-02T14:41:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: It was a customers, laotie t29 Or more like it was made from that
[2022-11-02T14:47:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: True, high stem What has modded inside And also right on handlebar, coz it's big one also, some mtb type i dont remember
[2022-11-02T14:50:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: ü§£ü§£ and yeah its like that
[2022-11-02T14:51:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You well overthinked it or see's in my head ü§£
[2022-11-02T15:42:33] Artem Bulashev: It needs to be consistent and needs not to fade as time goes. I will try to find a solution. I may have one actually. Drilling a hole right into shaft from the bottom where wheel seats, than screwing in nylon screw with same hu viscosity lube inside. = adjustable vertical pressure at the center, not a side and should be consistent üôÇüòò
[2022-11-02T15:42:37] Artem Bulashev: I will test it
[2022-11-02T15:58:22] Artem Bulashev: Will do
[2022-11-02T17:17:28] D J: will we have a discount or will we have batch2 free? I had the idea that it would be free for those who bought batch1 and didn't like it
[2022-11-02T17:21:13] Artem Bulashev: We are working out
[2022-11-02T17:22:12] Artem Bulashev: I wanted to make it free upgrade kit completely, but the end product of batch 2 doesn‚Äôt have any single part that is same as batch 1 üòÑüòÑ
[2022-11-02T17:24:26] Artem Bulashev: So because of that it‚Äôs hard to say what the final solution will be for those who are unhappy with batch 1 completely. Because some people use it and they like it so it‚Äôs hard to stay fair and yet equal. Once batch 2 is finished we will get back to this financial side. I‚Äôm donating my full profit of batch 2 into compensation of batch 1 users to reduce price
[2022-11-02T17:28:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: How nice of you üòäüôåüëèüëèüëè
[2022-11-02T17:35:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also unsure how much % this whole is your child , but Spin should understand that the Monorim way is not the good way
[2022-11-02T17:37:03] asyan4ik: MOSFET 75100 alu inside :)
[2022-11-02T17:37:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What i mean under that is sell a product than from feedbacks you know you need to modify or add extra part and you make next setup like that while you offer ppl to buy the extra pieces for a high price, while they (and in this case there is a lot ppl ww) get free labor
[2022-11-02T17:38:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If i would be mean ,i would say still crying? But no i dont say thatüòÖ also just tell how much you overscored numbers in %?
[2022-11-02T17:39:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: roughly
[2022-11-02T17:40:31] asyan4ik: No, I was ready for that. ~80-100%
[2022-11-02T17:42:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Thats in general ? Duty cycle? Or amps? Also doenst Sound good at all
[2022-11-02T17:43:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: It's worse than little sis or super box of there not so super

[2022-11-02T17:52:11] asyan4ik: 75100 alu PCB flipsky
[2022-11-02T17:53:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yeah i see no overscore on rated numbers üòÖ
[2022-11-02T17:54:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Are motors ok? Did u tried if are braked?
[2022-11-02T17:55:16] asyan4ik: Yeap , It must have been defective.

[2022-11-02T18:41:13] asyan4ik: Yes, 3kW motors, 18s battery
[2022-11-02T18:42:23] T·ëå·ñá·ó∑O·îï·ó©·îï·ëï·ïº: Ah ok. I thought you run Vsett or Blade with so much ampere üòâ
[2022-11-02T19:17:31] asyan4ik: I have a scooter originally Blade 10 with motors 60mm magnets
[2022-11-02T19:19:47] T·ëå·ñá·ó∑O·îï·ó©·îï·ëï·ïº: Very nice üëå
[2022-11-02T19:20:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: Good notice is 60mm can fit also in g30
[2022-11-02T19:21:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: I send prototypes to @roscheeee , but seems dead üòê @AJAJ1992 u know if he‚Äôs still alive?
[2022-11-02T19:26:02] Artem Bulashev: Those where doing 200a phase and 150a battery each üòÑ
[2022-11-02T19:26:07] Jan: He does that sometimes. I will drive to him this week
[2022-11-02T19:26:21] Jan: üî•
[2022-11-02T19:29:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yah but idk if he just don‚Äôt stay on telegram or he has no phone . Because if UPS call him and he no get answer, they will return package
[2022-11-02T23:39:37] Stan: I agree regarding using gloves even thinner gloves doesn‚Äôt grip great and slips often bit annoying at times would it be possible to increase wheel on batch 2 like possibly push it out words more or simply make it larger to have more room for the thumb to contact the wheel? Thats the only comment from me otherwise love it thanks @artBula
[2022-11-03T07:29:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Ohh shit

[2022-11-03T12:58:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the front ?
[2022-11-03T12:59:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and for aliens, it's a multipurpose icon üòâ
[2022-11-03T13:02:38] Mihail: The text font. But thats easy to change
[2022-11-03T13:02:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, it could be changed
[2022-11-03T13:12:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: Isn‚Äôt it rage logo?üòè
[2022-11-03T13:13:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, rage mechanics will handle the commercial/sales üòâ
[2022-11-03T14:01:36] Artem Bulashev: Unfortunately it is not possible without making casing larger - inside everything moves as close as 0.15mm from other components
[2022-11-03T14:01:59] Artem Bulashev: You mean make wheel taller ? To give more surface ?
[2022-11-03T14:02:46] Artem Bulashev: You should make a Police icon when speed camera ahead üòÇ
[2022-11-03T14:05:53] Oliver Eliasson: How hard whould it be or whould it work to just i increase the side by say 50% of all components? Maybe have two options, small more compact throttle with better clearance etc. and big edition with huge wheel but also more bulky case etc?
[2022-11-03T14:06:29] Oliver Eliasson: Would also be nice to have it a bit taller
[2022-11-03T14:08:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hehehe... the police mode icon is more discrete üòú
[2022-11-03T14:11:22] Artem Bulashev: I will explore making it taller but no promises. Enlarging whole thing is possible but also would have to be at a later stage I think with 200% throttle motion and new FW 99% or people will now be very happy even on high power. I will try to maximize wheel grip area upwards
[2022-11-03T14:15:09] Oliver Eliasson: Yeah thought more for for future, maybe having one normal and one that is really large and intended to be used with glowes
[2022-11-03T14:20:22] Artem Bulashev: Could be yeah
[2022-11-03T15:42:42] Unknown: Does front hydraulic brake set work on 1200w blade and monorim v2 suspension with only that monorim adapter? And i also need rear brake for back. I have konyk suspension so 2m is right size? Is there Any good set i should buy? I have normal m365
[2022-11-03T15:43:03] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-11-03T15:43:18] Mirono escooters: Better ask in m365 group tho/konyx
[2022-11-03T16:13:31] Stan: I would say both would help simply to have more contact with the thumb and the wheel
[2022-11-03T16:19:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I dont like These microfon portsü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2022-11-03T16:19:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Something like that
[2022-11-03T17:58:24] Artem Bulashev: checked and there is not much 0.3mm at most can be gained (can‚Äôt extend it down as spce is needed for wires - pcb placement.
[2022-11-03T17:59:16] Artem Bulashev: if we make later an XL version it will be possible to make it larger in all dimentions yes
[2022-11-03T18:00:46] Artem Bulashev: that will have to wait till gen2 released and feedback collected - if at least 66% will than reply in favor of 25% wheel increase I will make it happen
[2022-11-03T18:09:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Can you email survey all owners,just asking?
[2022-11-03T18:10:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also some ideas , unsure if they help or not
[2022-11-03T18:11:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Unsure now what is the shape and size of the wheel
[2022-11-03T18:12:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: <photos/photo_6575@03-11-2022_18-12-52.jpg>
[2022-11-03T18:13:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So to get it, you have the round shape ,what if all back side is not there if its full round
[2022-11-03T18:14:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also wheel maybe could have bigger gripping surface
[2022-11-03T18:16:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: <photos/photo_6576@03-11-2022_18-16-07.jpg>
[2022-11-03T18:16:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Less close cuttings and maybe deeper
[2022-11-03T18:17:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Maybe it would help in second ü§î
[2022-11-03T18:19:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Maybe if does are bigger a bit and not so close ,you get a better grip all time
[2022-11-03T18:19:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Coz some drives in gloves in winter only ,i wear gloves kinda almost and have like 5 kindüòÅ
[2022-11-03T20:34:55] Artem Bulashev: We can yes
[2022-11-03T20:37:19] Artem Bulashev: Won‚Äôt do much, I show some details from cad :) If I make it 180 degree only the wheel than when scroll 100 degree on latest (65 degree throttle / 35 degree ebrake) will make a hole visable after scrolling to one end or another
[2022-11-03T20:52:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I see ,just brainstorming
[2022-11-03T21:06:05] Artem Bulashev: Made a long video showing Gen2 design if any one is interested üëç
[2022-11-03T21:06:05] Artem Bulashev: Wheel design is very complex is to account for a lot of different aspect ü´£ not a single curve is by chance üôÇ
[2022-11-03T21:13:17] Artem Bulashev: 15min üòÑ May be some one will like to see behind the scenes
[2022-11-03T21:18:55] Jan: 440MB üò≥ i can pirate Avatar 2 in 4k for that
[2022-11-03T21:28:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well atleast we see it
[2022-11-03T21:33:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well it was pretty detailed and informative
[2022-11-03T21:36:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: As it's size so limited for now , only possible difference you could make is to play with spin button outer shape maybe less dense and bigger gaps get you better grip possible ü§î
[2022-11-03T21:38:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: <photos/photo_6578@03-11-2022_21-38-05.jpg>
[2022-11-03T21:38:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So maybe double that gap size ,but dont go out from the size you have nowü§îü§î
[2022-11-03T21:40:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: @artBula what you think about that ?
[2022-11-03T22:01:22] Artem Bulashev: Other people were asking for Rion type texture. I decided not to and take larger things because in gloves mine was still ok for me vs Rion completely not sensible. Also Rion one gets greased during summer and start to slip even on bare hand. (Many people reported such) So I‚Äôm not sure jacking even larger while deciders would work well. However 2 times longer travel should help alot with operation in gloves as well it is possible for me to release a wheel individually later during winter when I get a chance to test drive in gloves gen2 - than May be I will understand what is needed for gloves and manufacture ‚Äúalternative wheel‚Äù that will be possible to buy individually
[2022-11-03T22:18:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Sounds nice what you say ,rion surface even worse as i see ,its Really simple texture what it has ,it comes from tools
[2022-11-03T22:21:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also imagine a colder day with loose gloves or not so thin ones , you cant really feel where is the spinner and have to look down, but in summer gloves i didnt have problems
[2022-11-03T22:55:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: boosted use the same kind of texture, and i confirm it has a good grip with 'heavy' gloves.
[2022-11-03T22:58:30] Artem Bulashev: That‚Äôs unexpected - most people I asked reported it was not useable in gloves
[2022-11-03T23:00:18] Artem Bulashev: Interesting - wheel texture is hard one to get perfect for all occasion. But it is also cheap for me to produce new wheel later and give you guys upgrade option to texture like this or May be even a mix of my dipper groves + diamond finish
[2022-11-03T23:03:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i always use such gloves :

[2022-11-03T23:09:46] Artem Bulashev: Amazing üòª
[2022-11-03T23:10:18] Artem Bulashev: I don‚Äôt see how spiny would be less controllable than Rion texture in gloves like this
[2022-11-03T23:11:12] Artem Bulashev: May be in ski gloves even spin-y texture won‚Äôt be large enough though
[2022-11-03T23:11:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the texture act like 'glass paper', sorry, i don't known the proper word, but search google, you'll see what i meanüòÖ

[2022-11-03T23:19:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes. really a good grip.
[2022-11-03T23:20:54] Artem Bulashev: Ok got you I feel like I may need to mix my wheel with such finish and May be make spacing 50% larger between 25% less deep
[2022-11-03T23:21:09] Artem Bulashev: Auf that‚Äôs hard of to re do üòÖüòÇ

[2022-11-04T02:11:25] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-11-04T02:11:47] Artem Bulashev: with dimon cut pattern it may be optimal
[2022-11-04T02:12:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What you would think of

[2022-11-04T02:14:06] Artem Bulashev: opening is wider at the center
[2022-11-04T02:14:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Making this two closer , maybe it would improve more grippy ,unsure what's the good word
[2022-11-04T02:14:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yeah see that
[2022-11-04T02:14:41] Artem Bulashev: so that finger meat can naturally stay centered
[2022-11-04T02:14:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I see
[2022-11-04T02:15:07] Artem Bulashev: and top end is not as long curve = more surfce by about 20%

[2022-11-04T02:18:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Can we make take a look from the side like thisü§îjust to see difference more
[2022-11-04T02:18:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: To see difference in siluette ü§îü§î
[2022-11-04T02:19:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like old and new in different color
[2022-11-04T02:19:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Unsure how to describe better
[2022-11-04T02:21:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So a similar pics like i pointed,just totaly sideways so the one " behind" the other and only surface are shows in different color

[2022-11-04T02:32:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: True
[2022-11-04T02:33:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If this would do better job ,they could only upgrade button right?
[2022-11-04T02:34:10] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2022-11-04T02:34:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I mean if gen2 would have this surface and it would turn out it does have a better grip
[2022-11-04T02:35:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Gen1 owners could just change spinner by there self to upgrade gen 1 with gen 2 spinner?
[2022-11-04T02:37:36] Artem Bulashev: wheel shape is totaly differe from gen 1 - alot of optimisations and weight diet
[2022-11-04T02:38:10] Artem Bulashev: new one is made for 65/45 degree travel vs old one simple 45/45

[2022-11-04T03:03:18] Artem Bulashev: I think it very much micht be better than current with narrow deep grooves
[2022-11-04T09:38:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahhh. better !
[2022-11-04T12:27:43] Artem Bulashev: You like it more as well? :)
[2022-11-04T12:30:43] Artem Bulashev: We will use this design. It is growing on me too. - not sure about that finishing, serrations, if manufacturer won‚Äôt charge us too much will do them. Question remains on serration depth / frequency / pattern I suppose. No idea how they are manufactured
[2022-11-04T12:31:44] Artem Bulashev: If you have Rion throttle could you upload uncompressed close up photo please
[2022-11-04T12:41:46] Jan: If possible pls black wheel option
[2022-11-04T12:42:10] Jan: I have first gen colorless
[2022-11-04T12:48:59] Artem Bulashev: I hear you. I can promise that to happen now as we still have a lot of die from batch 1. But the reason why I offer naked version is that you can locally anodize it for cheap
[2022-11-04T12:49:40] Jan: Nothing is cheap in switzerland
[2022-11-04T12:49:57] Jan: I probably pay more to anodize it than the whole throttle
[2022-11-04T12:58:01] Artem Bulashev: I think most likely we will make small batch 2 same colors 100pc. And than once it has been sold and people report that all work as expected. Than will make larger batch 300-500pc with 3 color options ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2022-11-04T14:24:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You mean gen 1 ?
[2022-11-04T14:29:05] Artem Bulashev: Rion
[2022-11-04T14:29:32] Artem Bulashev: Too see that finishing pattern
[2022-11-04T14:30:01] Artem Bulashev: I‚Äôm worried that this pattern is not going to work with anodizing
[2022-11-04T14:30:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Anodizing dont mind pattern
[2022-11-04T14:30:46] Artem Bulashev: Because anodizing I think polishes sharp edges if I‚Äôm not mistaken
[2022-11-04T14:31:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I love that,just dont have it my workshop
[2022-11-04T14:31:19] Artem Bulashev: @koxx3 has
[2022-11-04T14:31:27] Artem Bulashev: Was repling to him on that
[2022-11-04T14:31:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Not really
[2022-11-04T14:31:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Damn , i have to be jealous now
[2022-11-04T14:32:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: üòÅ
[2022-11-04T14:32:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I have to make something for my self ,i hate these painted Engine's to be honest
[2022-11-04T14:34:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: On muggle lvl it doesnt really count ,but counts if you keep engine's hot
[2022-11-04T14:38:36] Artem Bulashev: Painted engines?
[2022-11-04T14:41:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yeah all is painted ,paint coated
[2022-11-04T14:41:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Doesnt help you cool at all
[2022-11-04T14:42:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Anodizing is same material,just oxid
[2022-11-04T14:42:50] Artem Bulashev: Polish it to perfect silver
[2022-11-04T14:42:57] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-11-04T14:43:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yeah i can show you engine caps like that now ,i have them üòÅ
[2022-11-04T14:43:31] Artem Bulashev: When you oxidizes a very edge of sharp corners is shaved off I believe
[2022-11-04T14:43:40] Artem Bulashev: Will double check that
[2022-11-04T14:44:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Just they start to roth back like alu rims ,time to Time needs to be polished
[2022-11-04T14:46:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: The more time it stays in the "bath" the thicker oxid layer becomes,if there is added coloring (some colors needs kinda paint) it ,than sure it gets thicker
[2022-11-04T14:47:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like this oilish mirrored a like for sure brown ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ But @koxx3 will tell best , it's like years when i was using

[2022-11-04T19:41:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: When you oxidizes a very edge of sharp corners is shaved off I believe
[2022-11-04T19:42:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: We were talking about does he loose sharp edges or not
[2022-11-04T19:43:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: On this, if they will make it anoized,will they loose some texture, that's what @artBula was asking about
[2022-11-04T19:52:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i think it's more the sanding process that remove sharp forms. i don't think boosted and rion throttle wheels are sandblasted or anodized. just raw aluminium
[2022-11-04T20:09:27] Artem Bulashev: Yeah they are just cnc naked
[2022-11-04T20:10:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Both can be true also ,and word aluminium is a wide thing from shitty alloys to pretty Strong ones
[2022-11-04T20:11:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, there are various quality in alloys üòÖ
[2022-11-04T20:11:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Even hard be sure what is what
[2022-11-04T20:12:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like what i can tell you for sure ,like randomly
[2022-11-04T20:12:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Xiaomi claims it's some plain quality type
[2022-11-04T20:12:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Lot times we put there rims in the lathe and true Strong
[2022-11-04T20:13:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Compared that with gbooster
[2022-11-04T20:13:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I was crYing in the result
[2022-11-04T20:15:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also the sheet pieces i use to mount contollers is from a company who makes huge house size stages for party concerts etc

[2022-11-04T20:16:54] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i used 6061 for smartdisplay seems pretty good for the usage
[2022-11-04T20:17:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_6591@04-11-2022_20-17-30.jpg>
[2022-11-04T20:18:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But in 1,2 cm thickness you weld it with AVI and heat bridges up to all surface in miliseconds , pretty funny that you just welded it with 400 A and you can touch it in seconds
[2022-11-04T20:18:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: That's nice
[2022-11-04T20:18:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: This was cutted by cnc ?
[2022-11-04T20:19:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes
[2022-11-04T20:19:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: + sandblasted + anodized
[2022-11-04T20:19:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well best quality can come out only like that
[2022-11-04T20:21:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I mean the things they shape cast cant be this material quality
[2022-11-04T20:21:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: That would be more fragile
[2022-11-04T20:23:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Lot work in it and its only the case üòÅ
[2022-11-04T20:25:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also was looking up on rion throttle,its the normal work tool shape what you see in it
[2022-11-04T20:25:50] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes üòÖ
[2022-11-04T20:25:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: <photos/photo_6592@04-11-2022_20-25-58.jpg>

[2022-11-04T20:26:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: This looks like 13 year old mexican kid made it
[2022-11-04T20:26:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: custom silicon joint... vaccum casted
[2022-11-04T20:26:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Nice
[2022-11-04T20:27:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I have company who could vacum cast kinda anything
[2022-11-04T20:28:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: <video_file>
[2022-11-04T20:29:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like one of this was broken on our car and ,he remade it with our numbers etc ,you cant tell it's not the original one
[2022-11-04T20:29:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Hardest maybe i saw is a copy off hella transparent light cap with numbers and focus
[2022-11-04T20:30:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Unsure how you call that dedicates light in the direction
[2022-11-04T20:31:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But i can share company link for you if you would like
[2022-11-04T20:44:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So if you take closer look it's not polished or something like that
[2022-11-04T20:46:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Only good i see is wheel size is bigger , but only eye measured to the hand Also top is grinded maybe for an easier position find where is itü§î
[2022-11-04T20:52:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And pattern on some steel stuff, as material is different,it changes how deep it is On the left 1-2 year old tool , Right one is like 50 year old ,so nothing new
[2022-11-04T20:52:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But this is an easy pattern by a machine ,done in seconds or less
[2022-11-04T21:28:11] rosheee: Tronic ESCs measure/calculate battery % wrong btw
[2022-11-04T23:50:55] Rogerio Figueiredo: Haha
[2022-11-05T02:22:00] rosheee: rion faget shit
[2022-11-05T02:22:04] rosheee: the motherfucker blocked me
[2022-11-05T02:23:10] rosheee: but we all here (i make video) gonna see if he got true benis like all here (most here) and can stand his benis and give me 2x 250R ESC like he promised when i pay him visit i know where his fucking address is and i gonna stream it live next year üòÜ
[2022-11-05T02:24:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: 250R üßêüßê

[2022-11-05T02:30:53] rosheee: in workshop 17:50
[2022-11-05T02:30:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: Why train
[2022-11-05T02:31:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: Use g30
[2022-11-05T02:31:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: üåù

[2022-11-05T02:32:19] rosheee: g30 20S can do 45km max boost 100% retard until 52V
[2022-11-05T02:32:36] rosheee: with 95kg rider up and downhill with 1.8bar tire pressure
[2022-11-05T02:32:40] rosheee: front+ rear
[2022-11-05T02:33:04] rosheee: <video_file>

[2022-11-05T07:57:19] rosheee: üôàüòÇ
[2022-11-05T09:48:46] sombre_enfant: Vsett is 120¬∞ it can be used on ninebot g30 esc or xiaomi... Change sensor wont change hall inclinaison its the shell of stator where theyre
[2022-11-05T09:50:27] S1m 0n: the only difference between 60 and 120 degrees is that the middle hall sensor is turned around. so why shouldn't it work?
[2022-11-05T09:50:52] S1m 0n: <photos/photo_6598@05-11-2022_09-50-52.jpg>
[2022-11-05T09:54:22] S1m 0n: and isn't it circumvented exactly as you say? vsett uses 60¬∞ not 120¬∞
[2022-11-05T09:55:09] S1m 0n: Looks for me like 60¬∞
[2022-11-05T09:55:34] sombre_enfant: Link ?
[2022-11-05T09:56:01] S1m 0n: https://www.falconpev.com.sg/products/vsett-motor-hall-sensor-pcb
[2022-11-05T09:57:10] sombre_enfant: Thanks will u replace wiring harness ? Now idk about the ¬∞ but if u change u will need to grind the stator shell to fit different
[2022-11-05T10:05:03] S1m 0n: no i will not replace the wiring harness. I'll just break out the middle reverb on the kaabo motor quick and dirty and turn it around and solder it to fit. it's just a test, don't hurt me if it breaks this motor or the vsett controller
[2022-11-05T10:05:49] S1m 0n: What u mean with "grind the stator shell?
[2022-11-05T10:07:21] S1m 0n: U mean that holes?
[2022-11-05T10:17:33] sombre_enfant: Ye
[2022-11-05T10:17:57] sombre_enfant: Og 1400w 10+?
[2022-11-05T10:33:31] S1m 0n: No, just kaabo Motor 60V/1000W
[2022-11-05T11:44:58] Mirono escooters: Finally down?
[2022-11-05T11:46:30] Mirono escooters: Yea just Dremel it abit out to turn sensor
[2022-11-05T14:14:51] S1m 0n: There already is extra hole üòú
[2022-11-05T14:21:18] Luis Magalhaes: Mine was like that, didn't have sensors but have the holes for them , 4 holes
[2022-11-05T16:59:55] Artem Bulashev: That‚Äôs very low pressure :) we run 50PSI in vsetts = 3.5 bar aprox
[2022-11-05T17:01:24] Artem Bulashev: Moment
[2022-11-05T17:04:16] Luis Magalhaes: Pmt says 2bar max or something like that üòÇ
[2022-11-05T17:16:43] Artem Bulashev: PMT need less yeah 35psi 10x3inch I think people use minimum on it = that‚Äôs about 2.4bar
[2022-11-05T17:18:19] Luis Magalhaes: He must be wanting to get more grip üòÇ
[2022-11-05T17:45:31] Artem Bulashev: Rubbing too low pressure causes tire to compress in and out every rotation - that breaks inner cord and than you will see tire having uneven hight
[2022-11-05T17:47:49] Luis Magalhaes: True
[2022-11-05T17:48:04] Luis Magalhaes: But i think it didn't last much km üòÇ
[2022-11-05T17:48:48] rosheee: i heaten the tire up ^^
[2022-11-05T19:27:00] Rogerio Figueiredo: Xiaomi here wand with 4.5 bar
[2022-11-05T19:27:04] Rogerio Figueiredo: Wanda rullz
[2022-11-05T19:28:19] Mirono escooters: Ohboy
[2022-11-05T19:28:59] Rogerio Figueiredo: Haha
[2022-11-05T19:29:16] Rogerio Figueiredo: I love the tires because they are very easy to Mont
[2022-11-05T19:29:28] Rogerio Figueiredo: Since I can't pass 45kmh
[2022-11-05T19:29:34] Rogerio Figueiredo: It's all good
[2022-11-05T19:33:57] Mirono escooters: Massage over
[2022-11-05T19:41:13] Luis Magalhaes: Any one know if theres a easy way to disable esc B on a red ubox?
[2022-11-05T19:42:03] Luis Magalhaes: I have the one i use to uso on my wolf there but the stm32 of side b is damage
[2022-11-05T19:42:33] Luis Magalhaes: If i could disable i would put it on my xiaomi üëÄ
[2022-11-05T20:09:12] Artem Bulashev: Holly shit guys
[2022-11-05T20:34:37] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_6602@05-11-2022_20-34-37.jpg>
[2022-11-05T21:01:08] Luis Magalhaes: any help on that ubox problem ?
[2022-11-05T21:01:09] Luis Magalhaes: lolol
[2022-11-05T21:10:58] Artem Bulashev: This is Spin-Y batch 1 linear test - raw hall out put per 5 degree. You can see how nearly 1/3 was dead zone due to hall sensor saturation, so result was short ‚ÄúUseful travel‚Äù + dead zone in the beginning of usual controllers. Now I make one change, add 1mm spacer to put magnets 1mm further away from hall. = saturation is gone almost completely!
[2022-11-05T21:12:24] Artem Bulashev: That is amazing to see how 1mm extra airgap can effect hall sensor output!
[2022-11-05T21:13:26] Mirono escooters: That's nice
[2022-11-05T21:40:09] Artem Bulashev: 1mm airgap removes 2/3 of the dead band! F insane.
[2022-11-05T21:41:29] Mirono escooters: Any physics explanation?
[2022-11-05T21:45:12] Artem Bulashev: Well for the dead band it‚Äôs simple, hall sensor can only take specific amount of magnetic energy. At max it will give max voltage out. If you have too strong magnetic field than sensor will be saturated earlier than we designed. The further away you are from magnet the weaker the field will be. So moving further removed that excess of magnetic force If I more it twice as far than field will be too week at hall output will never be Full.
[2022-11-05T21:45:32] Mirono escooters: Sounds logical! Thanks
[2022-11-05T21:46:46] Artem Bulashev: Yeah, physics tend to be logical. Unless you go into quantum physics lol
[2022-11-05T21:47:19] Mirono escooters: We didnt learn about saturation and magnets yet
[2022-11-05T21:47:23] Mirono escooters: <sticker>

[2022-11-06T00:29:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: Escooter wheel is very easy to break if pressure is no enough. Adam had this problem already
[2022-11-06T00:30:17] Mirono escooters: Ive got tons of damaged rims here. From tubeless without air
[2022-11-06T00:48:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I always put 4.2 bar no matter what
[2022-11-06T00:49:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: aslong it doesn't make boom

[2022-11-06T00:55:26] Mirono escooters: Front wheel drive doesn't help
[2022-11-06T01:29:32] Luis Magalhaes: 4.2 üò±
[2022-11-06T01:29:47] Luis Magalhaes: I use 2.8 to 3 bar üòÇ
[2022-11-06T01:55:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: fine with my weight surprisingly
[2022-11-06T02:19:10] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: fuck my temps
[2022-11-06T02:19:13] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and my ass acceleration even tho pushing 165A phase constantly... my fat ass should go running instead. To be fair it is very, veeery fucking windy.

[2022-11-06T10:46:27] rosheee: never hit 100% throttle...rofl WTF can't be real...why they shit their pants at 70?!
[2022-11-06T10:56:38] Face de Pin Suc√©: Few things : - very expansive scooter - carbon doesn't allow a fall, or your frame is dead with a crash - Rion isn't stable at all, FastRide, when they tested Rion thrust, they weren't very confident at high speed
[2022-11-06T12:33:12] Luis Magalhaes: But that will not cut power just to esc B, it will only disable the can bus connection from the two esc's right?
[2022-11-06T13:27:34] Newuser G: Guys hello An MT60 connector for cables phase motor is ok for 12AWG of cable of vesc?

[2022-11-08T14:10:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I re read you now about stm above, replacement needs high skill of soldering and more can be defo and its stm32 shortage
[2022-11-08T14:39:52] Luis Magalhaes: I have one of the burned ubox i think it was ok but it get some smoke from the mosfets burning üòÇ

[2022-11-09T19:39:06] Artem Bulashev: Fdbl is best in heat conducting - those were used in 75v dual red - which is to date is best back-conducting heat a vesc
[2022-11-09T19:40:54] Artem Bulashev: Aluminum pcb vesc from Spintend is coming soon

[2022-11-09T21:01:39] Artem Bulashev: You act actually yes
[2022-11-10T12:20:22] rosheee: Copper better?
[2022-11-10T13:20:58] Artem Bulashev: Aluminum pcb is pcb with full aluminum on one side - acts as heat transfer layer from pcb. - it‚Äôs a one layer pcb then for. Mosfets on top with heat decipation into PCB
[2022-11-10T13:27:54] Artem Bulashev: Target is by end of the year
[2022-11-10T13:28:12] Artem Bulashev: I think it is in prallel t spin-Y2
[2022-11-10T14:50:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: already thought about doing it to my ubox single but man I'd better sell it. Much better replacement is on the way anyway üòÅ
[2022-11-10T15:48:31] Artem Bulashev: This one works well for 45a-110a phase
[2022-11-10T15:49:00] Artem Bulashev: At 22s it is a lot
[2022-11-10T15:49:11] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: nah

[2022-11-10T16:13:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 100v 300A, but yes it can use 150v components
[2022-11-10T16:13:30] Luis Magalhaes: <animation>
[2022-11-10T16:13:51] Luis Magalhaes: üòÅ

[2022-11-10T16:14:42] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: The PCBs we ordered for now are with 100v capacitors
[2022-11-10T16:14:48] Mirono escooters: Noice
[2022-11-10T16:20:49] Luis Magalhaes: Nice üëå
[2022-11-10T16:20:58] Luis Magalhaes: Its your build?
[2022-11-10T16:21:38] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No, badgineer did the PCB and Owen the f405 pill
[2022-11-10T16:21:42] Mirono escooters: Badgineer and other guy
[2022-11-10T16:21:51] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2022-11-10T16:22:01] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I am just taking care of the EU group order
[2022-11-10T16:22:20] Mirono escooters: The mvp
[2022-11-10T16:22:39] Luis Magalhaes: How much it costs? Just to know üòú
[2022-11-10T16:24:09] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 14.29‚Ç¨ for 1x SMD assembled MP2 board and 23.40 ‚Ç¨ for the pill. MOSFETs, dc-dc, busbar etc have to be bought as well.
[2022-11-10T16:25:51] Luis Magalhaes: That total you have there is one assembly?
[2022-11-10T16:26:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: the total down below?
[2022-11-10T16:26:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: no that's the price I paid for production
[2022-11-10T16:27:16] Luis Magalhaes: The 455‚Ç¨
[2022-11-10T16:27:27] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: .
[2022-11-10T16:27:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 15x mp2 PCBs and 10x f405 pills
[2022-11-10T16:27:41] Luis Magalhaes: Ok üëå
[2022-11-10T16:28:04] Luis Magalhaes: Expensive but looks good üòÅ
[2022-11-10T16:28:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No, not at all
[2022-11-10T16:29:52] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It's 15 pieces, 15!!! Not one or two.
[2022-11-10T16:30:12] Luis Magalhaes: For the specs yes not expensive
[2022-11-10T16:30:37] Luis Magalhaes: 100v capable material is more expensive too right?
[2022-11-10T16:33:27] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: uhm components, not sure, probably?
[2022-11-10T16:36:14] Mirono escooters: Abit

[2022-11-10T16:56:04] Mirono escooters: Bet
[2022-11-10T16:56:06] Mirono escooters: Ebike tho sry
[2022-11-10T16:58:18] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no more order possible üò≠üò≠
[2022-11-10T16:58:28] Mirono escooters: How come
[2022-11-10T16:58:42] rosheee: @koxx3 send screen pls
[2022-11-10T17:03:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I will have a few mp2 PCBs over, but yeah no more f405 pills (there were only 10 available) sorry.
[2022-11-10T17:04:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: actually maybe I can give one of mine f405 pills away
[2022-11-10T17:05:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @koxx3 I can offer you one F405 pill and if needed ~2 MP2 ESC PCBs.
[2022-11-10T17:14:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: one f405 pill & 1 mp2, yes, interested
[2022-11-10T17:57:23] Mihail: Why use pill and not stm32 on the board? It is better for signal integrity and size.
[2022-11-10T17:58:03] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: modular, can be swapped out with anything else
[2022-11-10T17:58:27] Mihail: I dont get why tho
[2022-11-10T17:59:23] Mihail: As far as I know vesc is compiled only on f405 and runs on antique version of chibios
[2022-11-10T18:00:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It can be used with many different chips as well and there are ports of VESC to other chips or different software projects.
[2022-11-10T18:00:46] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: VESC with STM32F405 pill VESC with GD32F303CG pill (Netzpfuscher mod, note CG) EBICS with F103 Bluepill (Stancecoke) SmartESC V3 (Casainho) SmartESC V2 (Netzpfuscher/Koxx3) MESC with F401 Blackpill (MxlemmingFOC) STM32 Motor Control Workbench (F401, F103)
[2022-11-10T18:01:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: f405 chips expensive you know
[2022-11-10T18:01:19] Mihail: Not that expensive
[2022-11-10T18:01:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yeah but still, it's about availability and modularity. And side effect, if you burn the board u still have the pill and can swap it out into another
[2022-11-10T18:01:53] Mihail: It can also be replaced with gd32 variant
[2022-11-10T18:02:03] Mihail: But usb doen't work
[2022-11-10T18:02:41] Mihail: You can also swap the chip
[2022-11-10T18:04:09] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Even Spintend uses this kind of approach.
[2022-11-10T18:04:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Not that I would say that they are a good example but yeah, it's not bad to use a extra board
[2022-11-10T18:08:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: even the dc-dc are modules, if something fails, swap it out and you are good to go.
[2022-11-10T18:11:12] Luis Magalhaes: ebike is good too, send video haha
[2022-11-10T18:30:49] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I will do it on my Pro2 üòÅ
[2022-11-10T18:31:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: hope I won't burn the blade motor or my cables, if I am not limited by ESC temp anymore üòÖ
[2022-11-10T18:33:28] Luis Magalhaes: will be waiting for videos on youtube haha
[2022-11-10T18:34:21] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I post much more on Tiktok, YouTube only re-upload üòÖ

[2022-11-11T09:09:09] Luis Magalhaes: @marine_tugah i know that miguel had or has tronic in is 11x but it gets hot, dont know how many amps he is pushing (will not ask about him about that for some reasons) but its a 20s setup it should make more power then mine did with 16s
[2022-11-11T09:17:08] D J: Ask...ask and tell him that these controllers are crap ü§£
[2022-11-11T09:24:47] Luis Magalhaes: He already think everyone is envy, thats why he won't talk about his setups in chats, things breaks because of envy of you all!! üòÇ
[2022-11-11T09:25:23] Luis Magalhaes: Only show something when he need to share he can do better, what we gona do..
[2022-11-11T09:37:11] Jan: It gets hot? Lol just bad cooling solution
[2022-11-11T09:44:01] Luis Magalhaes: Yes, its in stock case outside
[2022-11-11T09:45:09] Luis Magalhaes: Dont know much of the project..If you do that coment to him your envy üòÇ
[2022-11-11T09:47:53] Luis Magalhaes: In the other day a guy shows his new setup testing doing 130kmh and he attacked the guy o did the battery saying thats no need yo use cooper because it has 10v of sag anywayüòÇ
[2022-11-11T09:53:06] Jan: Lol
[2022-11-11T09:56:03] Luis Magalhaes: Your buy your controller from foccer or tronic? Foccer right?
[2022-11-11T10:01:23] Jan: I bought from Focer but Focer 3.1 and Tronic 250 are basically identical controllers. I think Tronic has a worse soldering job
[2022-11-11T11:07:10] rosheee: And worser temp sens
[2022-11-11T11:54:39] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes very soon trust me üòÇüòÇ

[2022-11-11T11:55:16] rosheee: 200A battery per esc + 250A CONT.
[2022-11-11T11:56:12] rosheee: but @SibClimb motors are crazy
[2022-11-11T11:56:47] Face de Pin Suc√©: ??
[2022-11-11T11:57:02] Face de Pin Suc√©: 200A battery per esc on Tronic ?
[2022-11-11T11:58:15] rosheee: yes
[2022-11-11T11:58:22] rosheee: but i set 100A
[2022-11-11T11:58:39] rosheee: 180A peak so far lul
[2022-11-11T11:59:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: That is so weird
[2022-11-11T11:59:35] rosheee: u had scam tronics
[2022-11-11T12:00:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: I've seen like 10-30A peak more than the value for battery amps, but never saw almost the double when you set a value
[2022-11-11T12:00:26] rosheee: me all time
[2022-11-11T12:00:35] rosheee: i set 55A front and 71A rear with 16S
[2022-11-11T12:00:42] rosheee: and got 200A
[2022-11-11T12:00:57] rosheee: also phase and battery amps mostly same L:S
[2022-11-11T12:01:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: Never saw that, with many VESC x)
[2022-11-11T12:01:19] rosheee: XD
[2022-11-11T12:01:41] rosheee: next year on track u see suc√© overtaking with tronic g30

[2022-11-11T12:03:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: Hahaha I hope so
[2022-11-11T12:03:16] rosheee: but the motors are fuckeria
[2022-11-11T12:05:48] Jan: Send video üòÅ
[2022-11-11T12:05:56] rosheee: yes
[2022-11-11T12:05:59] rosheee: XD i go home soon
[2022-11-11T12:06:09] rosheee: i then i do videos
[2022-11-11T12:06:11] rosheee: if i don't shit my pants
[2022-11-11T12:07:19] Face de Pin Suc√©: Which one do you have now ?
[2022-11-11T12:07:26] rosheee: 10" 60H

[2022-11-11T12:08:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yah
[2022-11-11T12:08:02] Face de Pin Suc√©: Nice ones yes
[2022-11-11T12:08:03] rosheee: but cover says 250W
[2022-11-11T12:08:09] rosheee: @PaoloWu special fuckeria
[2022-11-11T12:08:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: If we can 80h in g30 then really good
[2022-11-11T12:08:36] rosheee: rofl
[2022-11-11T12:08:38] rosheee: then stem breaks
[2022-11-11T12:08:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Maybe don‚Äôt use brake xd
[2022-11-11T12:08:56] rosheee: even now if u do 100% throttle rear spins when wet at high speed
[2022-11-11T12:09:14] Face de Pin Suc√©: 80H are dual 40mm magnets :/ not so good
[2022-11-11T12:10:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: Practically no problem , dualtron always had 30mm x 2 on their
[2022-11-11T12:11:21] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes and shitty torque and very bad efficiency
[2022-11-11T12:11:29] rosheee: yes
[2022-11-11T12:11:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: That not due to dual magnet
[2022-11-11T12:11:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs due to shit control unit
[2022-11-11T12:11:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's a complete nonsense to have fual magnets, because it troubles the magnetic field and reduce the torque

[2022-11-11T12:46:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: Good copy hahah
[2022-11-11T12:46:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: But why even using shit fet
[2022-11-11T12:50:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: Looks so much like flipsky x)
[2022-11-11T12:52:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: 1:1
[2022-11-11T12:52:38] rosheee: Maybe better HW
[2022-11-11T12:52:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: Mosfet are worse
[2022-11-11T12:53:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: But hope can turn off hahaha
[2022-11-11T12:53:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: Hahaha
[2022-11-11T12:53:16] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-11-11T13:11:07] Artem Bulashev: Yeah I mean there is only like 4 components üòä not much difference you can make lol Have flip sky power board photo?
[2022-11-11T13:11:49] Artem Bulashev: Yeah all same ports as 100100 ubox single, incl built in IMU, fan port, and all other ports
[2022-11-11T13:14:59] rosheee: 0-300C in. 5sec
[2022-11-11T13:23:06] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6641@11-11-2022_13-23-06.jpg>
[2022-11-11T13:23:25] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6642@11-11-2022_13-23-25.jpg>
[2022-11-11T13:26:42] Artem Bulashev: Looses like Flip sky - has one resistor and one capacitor per mosfet - has some odd amount of connectors to logic - one ceramic capacitor and smaller cap on the end + Spintend has 4 components per fet Spin + has one quadruple connector per fet and a pair likely dedicated for logic board power / ground + dual ceramic capacitors and larger cap on the end
[2022-11-11T13:28:45] Artem Bulashev: I know that Spintend is using 1oz copper in the pcb, don‚Äôt know about flipsky
[2022-11-11T13:30:12] Artem Bulashev: I guess reverse polarity protection diod will be added as there is space but it is not needed for in-house testing
[2022-11-11T13:32:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: This is a tvs diode no reverse polarity protection
[2022-11-11T13:33:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: 1oz is the smaller size available, then the worse ü§î
[2022-11-11T13:35:13] Artem Bulashev: ?
[2022-11-11T13:35:18] Artem Bulashev: Didn‚Äôt understand
[2022-11-11T13:39:39] Artem Bulashev: What do you mean? 1oz is less than other ubox or FlipSky?
[2022-11-11T13:40:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: 1oz is the basic copper thickness for pcb
[2022-11-11T13:41:13] Artem Bulashev: I check with him
[2022-11-11T13:41:21] Artem Bulashev: Oh he recalled that message
[2022-11-11T13:41:38] Artem Bulashev: Guess that is May be for prototype purpose
[2022-11-11T13:41:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ask him to made the design with fdbl
[2022-11-11T13:41:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: Then we can buy spintend
[2022-11-11T13:41:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: Don‚Äôt use shit magnachip please
[2022-11-11T13:42:26] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Support it
[2022-11-11T13:42:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: With 1oz you will blew tracks with less than 100A
[2022-11-11T13:43:49] Artem Bulashev: What does flipsky use for mosfets ?
[2022-11-11T13:46:59] Artem Bulashev: I asked
[2022-11-11T13:48:06] Artem Bulashev: About pcb copper Oz, about possibility of fdbl fets, and about bending issue - suggested to add one screw in the middle perhaps
[2022-11-11T14:54:03] rosheee: I TOLD AMY
[2022-11-11T14:54:05] rosheee: MAKE BIGGER
[2022-11-11T14:54:07] rosheee: MAKE FATTER
[2022-11-11T14:54:10] rosheee: but not to fat
[2022-11-11T15:03:20] Artem Bulashev: There will be 12 fet version as well
[2022-11-11T15:04:23] Artem Bulashev: This one will target 140a phase and 70a battery give or take (equal to flipsky performance
[2022-11-11T15:04:33] Artem Bulashev: Will exist with 2 versions 80v and 100v
[2022-11-11T15:05:50] Artem Bulashev: ‚Äú1oz is because it is sample just for logic verify. Fets will have few fdbl, we still have some. Other option is j version fets. Proven in our 75v dual.‚Äù
[2022-11-11T15:06:02] rosheee: WE NEED 8OZ
[2022-11-11T15:06:04] rosheee: at least
[2022-11-11T15:06:15] Artem Bulashev: I don‚Äôt know what final oz will be
[2022-11-11T15:06:21] Artem Bulashev: This is just for logic test
[2022-11-11T15:06:42] Artem Bulashev: I know that oz in ubox was always higher than in flipsky
[2022-11-11T15:06:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: J fetüôÅ
[2022-11-11T15:07:19] Artem Bulashev: ‚ÄúIn aluminum. The difference of fets will not as much as FR4 pcb. But still have a little, the fdbl is the best.‚Äù
[2022-11-11T15:07:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: No, flipsky 75200 I had has more than my spintend 75v 100ax2
[2022-11-11T15:08:00] Artem Bulashev: So keep on look out for release with fdbl fets at first
[2022-11-11T15:08:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: In the fact flipsky was impossible to solder cable due to too much oz
[2022-11-11T15:08:35] Artem Bulashev: Which flipsky? 75200 single?
[2022-11-11T15:10:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: 75200 not alu pcb one, the one copy from as
[2022-11-11T15:10:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: With 3 xt90 plug
[2022-11-11T15:34:40] Artem Bulashev: Well it‚Äôs power rating doesn‚Äôt have any Spintend to put against so of course pcb oz should be more. But if you take Apple to apples like 75100 Spintend to 75100 flipsky (100a to 100a versions) than Spintend has higher Oz I believe every time or equal ?
[2022-11-11T16:02:11] rosheee: Yah but then fuckeria fets
[2022-11-11T16:02:18] rosheee: The tronic fets if they good
[2022-11-11T16:38:09] Artem Bulashev: So oz
[2022-11-11T16:38:32] Artem Bulashev: This is test sample for logic testing that‚Äôs why 1oz, but final will be 3-5oz
[2022-11-11T16:38:55] Artem Bulashev: Depending on final cost, because they need to be competitive to flipsky
[2022-11-11T16:39:49] Artem Bulashev: J fets are not bad at all
[2022-11-11T16:40:02] Artem Bulashev: Are they?
[2022-11-11T16:40:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: I pay 90‚Ç¨ flipsky üòã
[2022-11-11T16:40:23] Mirono escooters: Nice price
[2022-11-11T16:40:31] Artem Bulashev: Exactly, hard to compete while including extra futures
[2022-11-11T16:41:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: Makerbase 80‚Ç¨
[2022-11-11T16:41:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: But don‚Äôt know if is scam or not hahahah
[2022-11-11T16:41:18] Mirono escooters: Makerbase..

[2022-11-11T17:30:16] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: single - yes dual - yes too, can work with one motor
[2022-11-11T17:44:22] Rogerio Figueiredo: Okk so the one in sale is the single version right?
[2022-11-11T17:53:20] Artem Bulashev: And 3amp dcdc
[2022-11-11T18:20:34] Mirko Boni: On offer there is both the dual and single version.

[2022-11-11T18:25:32] Mirko Boni: In what sense wrong?
[2022-11-11T18:25:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: I bought the same as the your
[2022-11-11T18:26:15] Mirko Boni: I talked to Amy! She told me buy this because she doesn't heat up!
[2022-11-11T18:26:43] Mirko Boni: He told me not to buy the other version because it heats up
[2022-11-11T18:27:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, the same person told me no warranty due to overcurrent
[2022-11-11T18:27:24] Luis Magalhaes: They should sell the one that gets hot as less amps üòÇ
[2022-11-11T18:27:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: With 110A phase mine blewüòÇüòÇ
[2022-11-11T18:27:43] Mirko Boni: That's right Paolo
[2022-11-11T18:28:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: You happy to use vesc that blew at 110A?
[2022-11-11T18:28:15] Luis Magalhaes: Shit üëÄ the first's dual where the best ones so?
[2022-11-11T18:28:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: With 110A can‚Äôt even push a 500w motor üôÅ
[2022-11-11T18:28:25] Mirko Boni: That's what I told him too!
[2022-11-11T18:29:33] Mirko Boni: You should take the ubox 100v black, and install the ADC module with single/dual motor control and use it in single!
[2022-11-11T18:30:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: üëç
[2022-11-11T18:30:27] Mirko Boni: But that's stupid!
[2022-11-11T18:30:36] Mirko Boni: This makes no sense!
[2022-11-11T18:30:55] Luis Magalhaes: The dual to use as single?
[2022-11-11T18:31:04] Luis Magalhaes: Why? Because the bigger board?
[2022-11-11T18:31:25] Mirko Boni: Exactly! It is money spent in vain
[2022-11-11T18:31:41] Mirko Boni: For an economic discourse
[2022-11-11T18:33:45] Mirko Boni: @PaoloWu did you buy the 75V single today?
[2022-11-11T18:35:40] Luis Magalhaes: Yes its strange üòÖ
[2022-11-11T18:36:12] Mirko Boni: üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ
[2022-11-11T18:36:14] Luis Magalhaes: Someone has to put in market some better esc with vesc it will sell üòÇ
[2022-11-11T18:36:52] Mirko Boni: They exist, but they have high prices! Or that the flipsky 75100, but it is of low quality!
[2022-11-11T18:38:17] Luis Magalhaes: True too
[2022-11-11T18:39:40] Luis Magalhaes: But from what i know is flipsky and spintend (low cost) tronic/foccer and what more ? Trampa?
[2022-11-11T18:40:10] Mirko Boni: Foccer wonderful
[2022-11-11T18:42:43] Luis Magalhaes: With good cooling right?
[2022-11-11T18:43:21] Mirko Boni: Yess! An aluminum plate!
[2022-11-11T18:43:44] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_6646@11-11-2022_18-43-44.jpg>
[2022-11-11T18:43:44] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_6647@11-11-2022_18-43-44.jpg>
[2022-11-11T18:43:53] Luis Magalhaes: Like what they are doing with flipsky too
[2022-11-11T18:44:01] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_6648@11-11-2022_18-44-01.jpg>
[2022-11-11T18:44:16] Mirko Boni: Look at my photos
[2022-11-11T18:44:28] Luis Magalhaes: Yeah thes a good way acts as a cooler with wind too üëå
[2022-11-11T18:44:50] Luis Magalhaes: But you have spacer for battery too ?
[2022-11-11T18:45:00] Luis Magalhaes: Aluminium or 3d printed?
[2022-11-11T18:45:19] Mirko Boni: In dual motor with a battery of 70A x2 and a motor phase of 190A x2 I do not exceed 52 ¬∞
[2022-11-11T18:45:33] Mirko Boni: Full aluminum
[2022-11-11T18:45:44] Mirko Boni: Exactly
[2022-11-11T18:47:47] Luis Magalhaes: Nice i had some aluminium block under ubox and bolt to frame and even then i had to open a bit the deck to pass air as it looks like it sacturate the heat inside and get 65¬∞ max stressing full throttle at 70A batt and 220A phase 16S
[2022-11-11T18:48:05] Luis Magalhaes: 52¬∞ is excellent
[2022-11-11T18:48:17] Luis Magalhaes: Nice thats very cool
[2022-11-11T18:48:27] Mirko Boni: Could it be because my soleplate is very large?
[2022-11-11T18:48:48] Mirko Boni: The thickness of my plate is 15mm
[2022-11-11T18:49:15] Luis Magalhaes: Maybe better aluminium too then my frame üòÖ
[2022-11-11T18:49:49] Mirko Boni: In my opinion, yes! Because aluminum is an excellent conductor
[2022-11-11T18:50:34] Luis Magalhaes: I'm wanting to do something vesc related to my xiaomi 1s üòÇ but this time single motor üòÅ just to be a fun not heavy scooter
[2022-11-11T18:51:29] Luis Magalhaes: And the design of yours is more like a cooling plate my deck is just straight
[2022-11-11T18:51:49] Mirko Boni: It's the same thing I want to do!
[2022-11-11T18:52:04] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_6649@11-11-2022_18-52-04.jpg>
[2022-11-11T18:52:15] Mirko Boni: This is my single motor
[2022-11-11T18:52:32] Mirko Boni: I want to change the motor and battery with the single vesc!
[2022-11-11T18:52:33] Luis Magalhaes: Love those g30 üòç
[2022-11-11T18:52:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ora che monorim ha fatto il supporto per disco in alluminio puoi prendere quelloüåù
[2022-11-11T18:53:17] Mirko Boni: No Paolo, ho un cerchio davanti diverso
[2022-11-11T18:53:32] Luis Magalhaes: Same i want to do, plus rwd
[2022-11-11T18:53:44] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_6650@11-11-2022_18-53-44.jpg>
[2022-11-11T18:53:49] Mirko Boni: @PaoloWu guarda
[2022-11-11T18:54:03] Mirko Boni: Wonderful
[2022-11-11T18:54:25] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_6651@11-11-2022_18-54-25.jpg>
[2022-11-11T18:54:26] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_6652@11-11-2022_18-54-26.jpg>
[2022-11-11T18:54:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: Figo
[2022-11-11T18:54:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: Tubeless ?
[2022-11-11T18:54:51] Mirko Boni: @PaoloWu non ho bisogno di adattatore monorim
[2022-11-11T18:55:01] Mirko Boni: No no camera d'aria
[2022-11-11T18:55:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: Potresti farlo tubeless volendo
[2022-11-11T18:55:12] Mirko Boni: L'ho preso da tudor in Inghilterra
[2022-11-11T18:55:19] Mirko Boni: Tudor mi ha detto che potrei
[2022-11-11T18:58:21] Mirko Boni: @PaoloWu have you already tried the single spinted? Are the mosfets below or above?
[2022-11-11T18:58:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: Mosfet fdbl
[2022-11-11T18:59:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: Good mosfet but shit cooling
[2022-11-11T18:59:12] Mirko Boni: What does fdbl mean?
[2022-11-11T18:59:44] Mirko Boni: A me serve capire dove sono questi mosfet! Per sapere come posizionare la vesc!
[2022-11-11T19:00:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: Nella parte opposta di dove si fissa
[2022-11-11T19:00:12] Mirko Boni: Se sono sotto faccio una piastra
[2022-11-11T19:00:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: No in Cima
[2022-11-11T19:00:26] Mirko Boni: Merda... Allora la piastra non serve ad un cazzo
[2022-11-11T19:00:34] Mirko Boni: Fan culo
[2022-11-11T19:00:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: √à fatto per montare la ventola
[2022-11-11T19:00:55] Mirko Boni: @PaoloWu Ma la ventola non serve a nulla! L'aria sarebbe sempre la stessa üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2022-11-11T19:03:53] Mirko Boni: This fan thing pisses me off !!
[2022-11-11T19:04:09] Luis Magalhaes: This word i learn üòÇüòÇ
[2022-11-11T19:04:17] Mirko Boni: üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ
[2022-11-11T19:04:34] Mirko Boni: Luis where do you live?
[2022-11-11T19:04:41] Luis Magalhaes: Portugal
[2022-11-11T19:04:47] Mirko Boni: Woow ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2022-11-11T19:05:22] Mirko Boni: I am a photographer, I have traveled to many European countries, I have to go to the Algarve ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2022-11-11T19:05:43] Luis Magalhaes: @PaoloWu no way to cool down single ubox then? Just the trash can? üòÇ
[2022-11-11T19:06:12] Luis Magalhaes: You will like it üòú im from Alentejo
[2022-11-11T19:06:19] Mirko Boni: You need to install the air conditioning you have at home üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2022-11-11T19:07:39] Mirko Boni: Luis as soon as the vesc card arrives I will take it apart and with @PaoloWu let's try to invent something!
[2022-11-11T19:10:32] Luis Magalhaes: Will be waiting üòÅ
[2022-11-11T19:11:21] Luis Magalhaes: Im goint to scoot yo work now üòÇ back soon
[2022-11-11T19:12:45] Mirko Boni: Hi good evening
[2022-11-11T19:36:19] Luis Magalhaes: Red ubox
[2022-11-11T19:36:31] Luis Magalhaes: Just flashed firmware 75300
[2022-11-11T19:37:01] Luis Magalhaes: Old one
[2022-11-11T19:39:31] Luis Magalhaes: No just the open deck to have air flow
[2022-11-11T19:55:07] Mirko Boni: I put the artick dough
[2022-11-11T19:55:30] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_6653@11-11-2022_19-55-30.jpg>
[2022-11-11T19:59:12] Luis Magalhaes: Was going to put in ubox case to the aluminium block but i did shit and damage it üòÇ
[2022-11-11T19:59:41] Luis Magalhaes: That helps i think üòÅ
[2022-11-11T20:01:18] Luis Magalhaes: In my case the deck was getting hot, ubox was cooling slow after it got hot inside, with 3mm open deck it get cooler fast and the deck was not saturating, i think the material of chassis is not that good dissipating heat inside üòÖ
[2022-11-11T20:01:25] Luis Magalhaes: Of my wolf
[2022-11-11T20:03:09] Mirko Boni: I confirm! The frame is not good for dissipating heat!
[2022-11-11T20:18:46] Rogerio Figueiredo: Gmax power
[2022-11-11T20:19:03] Rogerio Figueiredo: Same paste that I use
[2022-11-11T20:24:14] Mirko Boni: Great thermal paste!
[2022-11-11T22:40:37] Artem Bulashev: What is the maximum 10+ motor was pushed to do here?
[2022-11-11T22:40:52] Artem Bulashev: @roscheeee ?
[2022-11-11T22:42:33] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6654@11-11-2022_22-42-33.jpg>
[2022-11-11T22:47:26] Artem Bulashev: @roscheeee do you have 0-100kmh with your 10+ motor 250a phase and how many battery amps?
[2022-11-11T22:48:59] Rogerio Figueiredo: I love it until I meet liquid on my pc that was what I used
[2022-11-11T22:49:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: He had registered 320A battery current
[2022-11-11T22:50:10] Mirko Boni: Why liquid? How come?
[2022-11-11T22:50:33] Rogerio Figueiredo: That was no cpu on scooter o never used
[2022-11-11T22:50:52] Rogerio Figueiredo: Because is conductive
[2022-11-11T22:51:16] Mirko Boni: Is artick a conductive paste?
[2022-11-11T22:51:28] Rogerio Figueiredo: No
[2022-11-11T22:51:41] Rogerio Figueiredo: Artic silver is not conductive
[2022-11-11T22:51:50] Mirko Boni: Ok! Wonderful
[2022-11-11T23:18:38] Artem Bulashev: Remaining toys arrived for custom cooling of MacBook Pro 2019 and build of custom lamps üòÑ Those 7070 (50w max) leds are BEAUTIFUL!
[2022-11-11T23:18:58] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6655@11-11-2022_23-18-58.jpg>
[2022-11-11T23:18:58] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6656@11-11-2022_23-18-58.jpg>
[2022-11-11T23:18:59] Artem Bulashev: So much better than 3570 30w
[2022-11-11T23:23:25] Artem Bulashev: 7070 emit even more lumen than 3570 from same watts I plan to make 2 led low beam (will shine at different level to creat tall beam pattern) and 1 led high beam Will run them in series = each square is 3v *3= 9v per half = 18v per led wires in series So low beam will be 36v, powered by 1amp driver = 36watt (super efficient, no heating) Hi beam 18v * 1.4amp driver = 25.2watt high beam (also efficient 50% of max üòÅ
[2022-11-11T23:24:26] Mirono escooters: Shite das nice
[2022-11-11T23:24:38] Artem Bulashev: Also got that 1.5mm copper bar, if I will want to make one led beam larger in all directions will be able to use that copper as spacer üôÉ and that will make beam wider and higher for the selected led
[2022-11-11T23:27:02] Artem Bulashev: Inside is stock 3570, outer line is stock 3570 with 1.5mm spacer and leds shifted higher and lower - a lot better beam pattern. Expect 7070 to further improve it Want to get ALL in one lamp 60w total without over heat
[2022-11-11T23:27:29] Artem Bulashev: If succeed will try to mass produce 100pc
[2022-11-11T23:28:00] Mirono escooters: Hopefully without overheat
[2022-11-11T23:28:06] Mirono escooters: Passive cooling or ride cooling?
[2022-11-11T23:37:27] Artem Bulashev: Efficiency would be very good with those leds and that set up
[2022-11-11T23:37:36] Artem Bulashev: Dc-dc driver is external
[2022-11-11T23:38:16] Artem Bulashev: Will see May be I can fit it inside lamp
[2022-11-11T23:38:31] Mirono escooters: Always handy
[2022-11-11T23:38:55] Artem Bulashev: I want it to be simple, dc-dc outside is not best for that)
[2022-11-11T23:39:06] Mirono escooters: Yes

[2022-11-12T02:28:43] rosheee: NEVER LET ME DOWN

[2022-11-12T08:54:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: I told him with those values it would die soon üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2022-11-12T12:41:46] Mirono escooters: Was to be expected
[2022-11-12T12:52:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: seriously ? what's wrong with you man ? constructor says : - 250A phase - 300A phase max for 3s and you complain because it burnt at 452A phase ? why a manufacturer should assume your wrong usage ?
[2022-11-12T12:52:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: by the way, I think it's a main issue with VESC vs other controllers. vesctool allows a lot of tweaking but doesn't constrain enought the user. a LOT of things can be wrongly configured and lead to burning VESC.
[2022-11-12T12:53:00] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's dual, so values divided by 2 to have for one
[2022-11-12T12:54:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok, ok, if dual, my mistake then
[2022-11-12T13:00:20] Jan: It also did not break under full power
[2022-11-12T13:00:40] Jan: It broke under the usage of traction control on a very slipper surface
[2022-11-12T13:11:36] Mirono escooters: Is that tronic fault or vesc..
[2022-11-12T13:13:16] Jan: Thats a good question, but tronic does not want cover it anyway
[2022-11-12T13:14:48] Mirono escooters: Understandable after the misery xD
[2022-11-12T13:14:59] Mirono escooters: I don't think its their fault, it would b weird
[2022-11-12T13:15:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: I can understand traction control fail
[2022-11-12T13:15:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: But xd 170A batt current instead 120AüòÇüòÇ
[2022-11-12T13:16:16] Mirono escooters: Roschee pushes them shits alot
[2022-11-12T14:48:47] Luis Magalhaes: <animation>
[2022-11-12T14:59:45] Artem Bulashev: His set up is single no?
[2022-11-12T15:00:20] Artem Bulashev: Even if dual - can‚Äôt put more than 150a phase on front. So that means 300a on rear out of 450a phase
[2022-11-12T15:01:58] Artem Bulashev: Battery 220a for 6 fet is too much
[2022-11-12T15:17:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: Battery amps when you reach high speed is exatly same as rear , if both same settings
[2022-11-12T16:19:42] Artem Bulashev: ubox dual red os 5Oz
[2022-11-12T16:21:15] Artem Bulashev: I gave my recommendation about Aluminum PCB ubox to be +1Oz from ubox dual 75v red (+20%)
[2022-11-12T16:23:11] Artem Bulashev: Don‚Äôt know if they will do it but at least hope that will convince not to fuck up and make less than 5Oz
[2022-11-12T16:24:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not is needed that much oz
[2022-11-12T16:24:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Existing bus barüòÇ
[2022-11-12T16:30:13] Artem Bulashev: So what‚Äôs your recommendation ? Wonder what flipsky uses in Alum
[2022-11-12T16:31:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: 5oz is even enough with right design and bus bar
[2022-11-12T16:32:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: But more is better will be, more copper surface also help cool
[2022-11-12T16:32:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: But we don‚Äôt want that instead high prices
[2022-11-12T18:12:42] rosheee: Dude u have no fcking clue
[2022-11-12T18:13:09] rosheee: 452A on 2 ESCS 2X250A is 500 right
[2022-11-12T18:13:13] rosheee: Thr FW is locked

[2022-11-12T18:13:41] rosheee: Set 250A phase max 300A current max
[2022-11-12T18:13:45] rosheee: Omfg xD
[2022-11-12T18:13:55] rosheee: Then i would be a facking dumbass

[2022-11-12T21:25:55] Mirono escooters: How can 6 fet be rated so high
[2022-11-12T21:26:15] Mirono escooters: But what happend, fet decided it wanted to be a smoke machine?
[2022-11-12T21:26:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I was joking of course. may the STM32 can be alive ? but I doubt üòÖ
[2022-11-12T21:26:55] rosheee: I turned on TCS Then 100% throttle
[2022-11-12T21:26:59] rosheee: Then smokemachine
[2022-11-12T21:27:15] rosheee: As u hear here

[2022-11-12T21:27:43] rosheee: Mobilephone was in my backpack btw
[2022-11-12T21:47:21] rosheee: Battery all good
[2022-11-12T21:47:24] rosheee: Thx 2 kapton
[2022-11-12T21:47:35] rosheee: And tudor battery always godmode
[2022-11-12T21:47:49] rosheee: When dejans house burned only his battery survived
[2022-11-12T21:48:18] rosheee: <photos/photo_6665@12-11-2022_21-48-18.jpg>
[2022-11-12T22:18:06] Jan: There is a reason that NASA uses Polyimide insulation. Thats why we used it as well everywhere multiple layers. The stacking of controller and battery is so close, if anything burns, polyimide survives. If you want full protection, aramide sheets with polyimide
[2022-11-12T22:26:08] Luis Magalhaes: Seeing this my ubox burn was nothing üòÇ
[2022-11-12T22:26:21] rosheee: ubox had case
[2022-11-12T22:26:24] rosheee: this not
[2022-11-12T22:26:28] rosheee: but this was just 1 mosfet burning
[2022-11-12T22:27:16] Luis Magalhaes: Yes that's true too but seem worts them mine üòÖ i did unplug it like 2 seconds after burn üòÇ
[2022-11-12T22:27:41] Luis Magalhaes: But had niquel damage in battery too üòÖ
[2022-11-12T22:27:45] rosheee: i just pressed powerbutton while burning
[2022-11-12T22:28:16] Luis Magalhaes: Mine burn with open deck and wheels in air, it had a problem üòÇ
[2022-11-12T22:29:04] rosheee: xD
[2022-11-12T22:29:52] Luis Magalhaes: @roscheeee what goes in next? Don't have any vesc to put in?
[2022-11-12T22:31:05] Jan: He gave the two replacement to me
[2022-11-12T22:31:17] Jan: I will send in focer for warranty

[2022-11-12T22:33:42] Mirono escooters: Ohh yess
[2022-11-12T22:33:49] Mirono escooters: Mm fit
[2022-11-12T22:33:55] Mirono escooters: Bye-bye bad cooling :)

[2022-11-12T23:10:03] rosheee: Never
[2022-11-12T23:10:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: With g30 yes
[2022-11-12T23:10:44] rosheee: We use aramid as additional layer between edc and battery now
[2022-11-12T23:10:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: Other scooter i put external
[2022-11-12T23:12:19] Luis Magalhaes: All in üòÇ
[2022-11-12T23:12:23] rosheee: Maybe that is why rion puts it outside
[2022-11-12T23:12:35] Mirono escooters: Good bukake cooling now+waterproof
[2022-11-12T23:12:44] Mirono escooters: Before in wildman bag hotter then roschee stuff
[2022-11-12T23:12:50] Luis Magalhaes: Cold air üòÇ
[2022-11-12T23:13:18] rosheee: We have as well
[2022-11-12T23:14:22] Jan: From an engineering and safety point of view its great, from design and aesthetics perspective its terrible. I cannot have cables and stuff outside on the g30 build
[2022-11-12T23:15:06] Mirono escooters: Aesthetics are for jan nr1 priority Safety second
[2022-11-12T23:15:06] Mirono escooters: ;)
[2022-11-12T23:15:21] rosheee: Absolute
[2022-11-12T23:15:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yea, but my priority safety, I learned that after tested much vesc
[2022-11-12T23:15:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: So rosche‚Äôs vesc blew don‚Äôt surprise meüòÇ
[2022-11-12T23:15:40] rosheee: 1cm spacer on 16S is omfg
[2022-11-12T23:15:45] rosheee: Ubox v1 never
[2022-11-12T23:16:03] rosheee: Since over 25k km
[2022-11-12T23:16:10] Mirono escooters: Bluetooth reciever inside alu heatsink case How bad will range be? I need 3M
[2022-11-12T23:16:27] Luis Magalhaes: G30 clean build looks great
[2022-11-12T23:17:01] rosheee: 16S5P was clean
[2022-11-12T23:25:43] rosheee: 16S never let me down with vsett motors and ubox v1 ..never since build
[2022-11-12T23:26:13] rosheee: BUT i rly wanna know what happens when u set 110A max battery current per ESC (default warranty firmware)
[2022-11-12T23:30:47] Luis Magalhaes: On ubox?
[2022-11-12T23:31:25] rosheee: yes
[2022-11-12T23:31:33] rosheee: u can set 110A in stock FW
[2022-11-12T23:33:53] Luis Magalhaes: Did never pass above 70A batt per esc
[2022-11-12T23:34:02] rosheee: 71A i done max no problem
[2022-11-12T23:34:18] Luis Magalhaes: I did not have battery for more üòÇ
[2022-11-12T23:34:19] Mirono escooters: Boring
[2022-11-12T23:34:25] rosheee: but if they say 110A max battery / 135A max motor current and 180a max current i believe 110A max battery ^^ (lol) should work
[2022-11-12T23:34:32] Luis Magalhaes: Now i have.. but not using uboa
[2022-11-12T23:34:34] Luis Magalhaes: Ubox üòÖ
[2022-11-12T23:35:48] Luis Magalhaes: Yes but 135A on my motors was too slow üòÇ
[2022-11-12T23:35:59] rosheee: on vsett perfect
[2022-11-12T23:36:03] Luis Magalhaes: 220A was a sweet apot üòÇ
[2022-11-12T23:36:08] Luis Magalhaes: Spot

[2022-11-12T23:50:41] Mirono escooters: Safety
[2022-11-12T23:59:38] Luis Magalhaes: Wtf? üòÇ
[2022-11-12T23:59:57] rosheee: lol tire very safe
[2022-11-13T00:00:53] Mirono escooters: And i thought i did sketchy shit
[2022-11-13T00:28:55] Artem Bulashev: You should not
[2022-11-13T00:29:22] Artem Bulashev: It is not the that type of controller / price range to support such high output reasonably speaking
[2022-11-13T00:30:12] Unknown: Stock doesn't let me go above 160
[2022-11-13T00:30:21] Artem Bulashev: Though temp is not defined by Phase amps only, it is battery amps that determin how long Phase amps will be at FULL, so they work together If you set 160a phase and 35a battery it will be fine
[2022-11-13T00:30:55] Unknown: Makerx rate lt for 120 motor 80 battery
[2022-11-13T00:31:12] Unknown: We all had good experience with makerx, in terms of reliability and cs
[2022-11-13T00:31:23] Artem Bulashev: No wonder. It is FW locked than. For a good reason :) Also don‚Äôt forget Phases are HUGE source of EMI, and it can effect how well controller can calculate. One mistake and pfff
[2022-11-13T00:31:39] Artem Bulashev: That‚Äôs great ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2022-11-13T00:31:42] rosheee: spintend 75V ubox v1 is locked at 110A battery per esc
[2022-11-13T00:31:48] rosheee: + 135A phase and 180A current max
[2022-11-13T00:31:55] rosheee: phase + current max is ok but 110A battery xD?
[2022-11-13T00:32:01] Artem Bulashev: The fact that they limit it at that level says a lot
[2022-11-13T00:32:30] Artem Bulashev: Yeah lol
[2022-11-13T00:33:00] Artem Bulashev: Unlikely it can survive that
[2022-11-13T00:33:16] Artem Bulashev: Not 75v single, not with that design
[2022-11-13T00:33:28] rosheee: 75v dual ubox v1
[2022-11-13T00:33:32] rosheee: the beta version üòÜ

[2022-11-13T00:34:42] Mirono escooters: Ye I like zm
[2022-11-13T00:34:48] Mirono escooters: Maybe roschee should try
[2022-11-13T00:35:17] rosheee: zm?

[2022-11-13T00:48:48] rosheee: No
[2022-11-13T00:49:33] rosheee: I stick to LF (remaining tronic) LF had better temp. Lol
[2022-11-13T01:09:15] rosheee: I put 100A battery in 30min on ubox v1 75v
[2022-11-13T01:44:19] Rogerio Figueiredo: Lol

[2022-11-13T01:52:10] Rogerio Figueiredo: I think vesc is good for the xiaomi style
[2022-11-13T01:52:52] Luis Magalhaes: You have here scooters doing more amps then mine with vesc üòÅ
[2022-11-13T01:53:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: I know
[2022-11-13T01:53:59] Rogerio Figueiredo: Here is a gmax doind more speed that you wolf
[2022-11-13T01:54:30] Luis Magalhaes: Yes, i have stock motors not high kv üò≠üòÇ
[2022-11-13T01:54:43] Rogerio Figueiredo: Money spend is high
[2022-11-13T01:59:02] rosheee: problem was TCS
[2022-11-13T01:59:16] rosheee: i pushed the ESCS before activated TCS to max
[2022-11-13T01:59:20] rosheee: no problem
[2022-11-13T01:59:35] rosheee: phase + battery amps gone higher everytime
[2022-11-13T02:37:51] rosheee: that it can be mounted to frame?
[2022-11-13T02:37:55] rosheee: why not thicker mosfets
[2022-11-13T02:37:56] rosheee: i write amy about this

[2022-11-13T02:39:05] rosheee: use tronic mosfet
[2022-11-13T02:39:15] rosheee: XD they are bigger and have smoke feature
[2022-11-13T02:40:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: These are better than TRONIC mosfet
[2022-11-13T02:45:41] Artem Bulashev: Because it is meant to be 100a controller man
[2022-11-13T02:45:45] Artem Bulashev: Not 200
[2022-11-13T02:46:00] Artem Bulashev: And mosfets are not the problem
[2022-11-13T02:46:13] Artem Bulashev: Cooling through the back has its limitations
[2022-11-13T02:48:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Need double side cooling
[2022-11-13T02:48:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: This should be good feature
[2022-11-13T02:48:29] rosheee: but the ubox v1 75V or the ubox 100V also 100A
[2022-11-13T02:48:32] Mirko Boni: In fact I was talking about it with Roger, I'm studying a system to mount it without a case to attach the mosfet to an aluminum plate!
[2022-11-13T02:48:33] rosheee: dual
[2022-11-13T02:48:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ask spintend if possible double side cooling
[2022-11-13T02:48:46] rosheee: i write amy now about it
[2022-11-13T02:48:56] rosheee: I TOLD HER TO GET ESC THAT U CAN MOUNT MOSFETS TO FRAME
[2022-11-13T02:48:58] rosheee: because us idiots here
[2022-11-13T02:49:20] Mirko Boni: I ignorant üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2022-11-13T02:50:31] Mirko Boni: I am sure that if I can install the mosfets in contact with the aluminum plate then there will be no problems!
[2022-11-13T02:50:39] Artem Bulashev: Those mosfets had some other issue
[2022-11-13T02:50:48] rosheee: why they use them?
[2022-11-13T02:51:04] Artem Bulashev: I mean double side cooling mosfets
[2022-11-13T02:51:22] Artem Bulashev: I think price is def one of the problems
[2022-11-13T02:51:29] Artem Bulashev: Availability is second
[2022-11-13T02:51:46] rosheee: why not put the NCR shit on it like little focer?
[2022-11-13T02:51:55] rosheee: then they never have cooling issues
[2022-11-13T02:51:55] Artem Bulashev: Try find such with suitable specifications
[2022-11-13T02:52:09] rosheee: NCR can do 200-250A i think without TCS on
[2022-11-13T02:52:10] Mirko Boni: So if it doesn't exceed 100A it doesn't overheat?
[2022-11-13T02:52:19] Artem Bulashev: Correct
[2022-11-13T02:52:32] Artem Bulashev: It can do 110a phase 45a battery no over heat
[2022-11-13T02:52:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: NCE xd
[2022-11-13T02:52:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: You mean to247 package
[2022-11-13T02:52:51] Artem Bulashev: Still suboptimal design
[2022-11-13T02:53:14] Artem Bulashev: Yeah that package seems like the way to go
[2022-11-13T02:53:29] Artem Bulashev: But I think Alum design proved it t wrong
[2022-11-13T02:53:37] rosheee: NCE XD
[2022-11-13T02:53:40] Mirko Boni: What if you mount a heatsink with a fan and let air in?
[2022-11-13T02:54:11] Artem Bulashev: If you mount it open air in from of the scooter than cooling is no issue and off you go to 200a phase 100a battery
[2022-11-13T02:54:13] rosheee: why they don't do beta and send 5-10 pre production ESCS to guys who test them until burns?
[2022-11-13T02:54:22] rosheee: then they know " ok esc runs hot with 10A phase and 2A battery"
[2022-11-13T02:54:35] rosheee: then they can change dfesign and not getting issue like with last single
[2022-11-13T02:54:45] Artem Bulashev: What you don‚Äôt know is that escooter is only 15% or sales
[2022-11-13T02:54:59] Mirko Boni: Ok perfect! I have to study a system!
[2022-11-13T02:55:14] Artem Bulashev: Mono wheels of different types take up 70% of the sales
[2022-11-13T02:55:35] Artem Bulashev: That‚Äôs why they keep on putting IMU inside
[2022-11-13T02:55:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: There‚Äôs much manufacturer of alu pcb manufacturer That I want to know is: What‚Äôs the heat transfer between copper layer and alu plate? Normally is 1w/mk
[2022-11-13T02:55:55] Artem Bulashev: That‚Äôs how they retain that market over Flipsky
[2022-11-13T02:55:56] rosheee: monowheels are crap
[2022-11-13T02:56:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: If they can made 2-3w/mk should be perfect , I don‚Äôt know if exist
[2022-11-13T02:56:12] rosheee: depends
[2022-11-13T02:56:25] rosheee: their thermalpads are much better than the ones i have btw
[2022-11-13T02:56:25] Artem Bulashev: No idea
[2022-11-13T02:56:30] Artem Bulashev: All I know it‚Äôs amazing
[2022-11-13T02:56:36] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6670@13-11-2022_02-56-36.jpg>
[2022-11-13T02:56:51] Artem Bulashev: Those leds are on 1.5mm Copper pcb
[2022-11-13T02:56:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: U don‚Äôt understand anything lol
[2022-11-13T02:57:16] Mirko Boni: Sorry, at this point we need to find a material that allows air to pass but not water! For example technical fabric!
[2022-11-13T02:57:20] rosheee: how?
[2022-11-13T02:57:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: Alu pcb are 3 layer : -copper layer -insulation layer -aluminium layer
[2022-11-13T02:57:34] Artem Bulashev: That is a mystery
[2022-11-13T02:57:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: Need to know what‚Äôs the heat conduction
[2022-11-13T02:57:49] Artem Bulashev: I will ask
[2022-11-13T02:57:57] rosheee: i even told them that the 17w/mK pads for 100chf never fucked like theirs
[2022-11-13T02:58:19] rosheee: then they send me new fuckeria pads and ubox was cool again
[2022-11-13T02:58:27] Artem Bulashev: Considering that separation layer is like 0.05mm it has to be good
[2022-11-13T02:58:42] rosheee: but best is when u do tests they've never done
[2022-11-13T02:58:55] rosheee: 100V ubox going 2x200A phase @ 20S
[2022-11-13T02:59:00] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6671@13-11-2022_02-59-00.jpg>
[2022-11-13T02:59:02] rosheee: or higher
[2022-11-13T02:59:04] Artem Bulashev: Me yesterday
[2022-11-13T02:59:12] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6672@13-11-2022_02-59-12.jpg>
[2022-11-13T02:59:20] rosheee: lol
[2022-11-13T02:59:35] rosheee: coollaboratory liquid metal = more fuckeria
[2022-11-13T02:59:54] Artem Bulashev: Liquid Metal on CPU Liquid Metal on GPU die and CYY paste on GPU around Die - MASSIVE difference by the way!
[2022-11-13T03:00:57] rosheee: sry üòÜi read again
[2022-11-13T03:01:22] Artem Bulashev: Difference is 2x the fps üòÅüëç
[2022-11-13T03:01:29] rosheee: word
[2022-11-13T03:02:41] rosheee: on older intel cpus (9700 and older before they weld cpux heatspread) direct die just gave u 5-10C better temps
[2022-11-13T03:02:59] rosheee: CYY =how many w/mK?
[2022-11-13T03:03:06] Mirko Boni: Roger, what if we take the lid off? And do we mount it upside down? Is it possible in your opinion?
[2022-11-13T03:03:20] rosheee: idk üòÜ
[2022-11-13T03:03:33] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_6673@13-11-2022_03-03-33.jpg>
[2022-11-13T03:03:35] Artem Bulashev: The best, beat Grizzly by 3 degrees
[2022-11-13T03:03:40] rosheee: how many xD?
[2022-11-13T03:03:44] rosheee: gorilla?
[2022-11-13T03:03:53] rosheee: 16 w/mK?

[2022-11-13T03:04:56] Mirko Boni: As I get home I take it apart and do experiments!
[2022-11-13T03:06:46] Artem Bulashev: Thats + 46% 55% gain on GPU ü§£ü§£üëç
[2022-11-13T03:07:14] rosheee: ^^
[2022-11-13T03:07:17] Artem Bulashev: Now playing GTA5, all setting Very High, x8, game goes at 60FPS non stop

[2022-11-13T03:18:38] Rogerio Figueiredo: The m1 is better than i9
[2022-11-13T03:19:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: Very long autonomy and small and light
[2022-11-13T03:19:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: And fast üòç
[2022-11-13T03:19:27] rosheee: ^^' ok....
[2022-11-13T03:19:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yah when I‚Äôm in train is very Suce
[2022-11-13T03:19:45] rosheee: super
[2022-11-13T03:19:57] rosheee: most applications faster on windows
[2022-11-13T03:19:58] rosheee: or linux
[2022-11-13T03:20:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: My asus with similar performance is 3kg :(
[2022-11-13T03:20:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: But 2h autonomy
[2022-11-13T03:20:32] rosheee: and fagetbook?

[2022-11-13T03:20:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: I have
[2022-11-13T03:20:45] rosheee: and macfagbook?
[2022-11-13T03:20:48] rosheee: 30h?
[2022-11-13T03:21:56] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6676@13-11-2022_03-21-56.jpg>
[2022-11-13T03:21:56] Artem Bulashev: 5 and 6th fastest in the world from all people who tested with this computer üòÅüòÅ Should I try to get 25 points more to be n2 ? üòÑü§£
[2022-11-13T03:22:38] Artem Bulashev: Not for games, at least not right now :)
[2022-11-13T03:22:42] rosheee: download gpu oc tool
[2022-11-13T03:23:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Omg who buy MacBook for gaming
[2022-11-13T03:23:29] rosheee: most applications are slower on macbook ^^'
[2022-11-13T03:23:41] rosheee: but omfg i stop here
[2022-11-13T03:24:15] rosheee: my 1st and last macbook pro burned my legs
[2022-11-13T03:25:11] Artem Bulashev: Because ecosystem is so much better. I can access my computer folders at any time from iPhone or ipad I can press copy something on Ipoh and and simple press Past on computer and it will past what I copied on the phone. - super useful Also I never have to do back ups, all files are backup every instance anything is changed to the iCloud. And it works for nearly 11h on battery of movie watching And I can game at maximum settings now üòéüòÅ
[2022-11-13T03:27:10] Artem Bulashev: This one doesn‚Äôt and with my settings even less now. Ubdervoltaging GPU = increasing efficiency = same amp produce same result, but less watts consumed = less heat üòé
[2022-11-13T03:27:57] Artem Bulashev: That‚Äôs because all aluminum. Cheap computers are hotter but you don‚Äôt fill because plastic is as thick as entire MacBook pro Off topic though haha
[2022-11-13T03:29:25] Artem Bulashev: It‚Äôs not it is for work, but now I can play any modern game at High or Maximum settings with good fps what else one can need for occasional gaming session Honestly was more of challenge
[2022-11-13T03:29:44] rosheee: same windows ^^
[2022-11-13T03:29:55] rosheee: but stop here xD
[2022-11-13T03:30:08] Artem Bulashev: Agree
[2022-11-13T03:30:12] rosheee: i hate mac
[2022-11-13T03:30:22] Artem Bulashev: üòÅüëå
[2022-11-13T03:30:23] rosheee: and stopped pimpin' PCs
[2022-11-13T03:30:39] rosheee: fuck that shit ...jesus spend nights on RAM timings for shit anyway
[2022-11-13T03:30:46] rosheee: but pimpin' RAM = more b00st
[2022-11-13T03:33:12] Artem Bulashev: I have it stock config, it‚Äôs fast enough 2666 MHz DDR4 64gb
[2022-11-13T03:33:25] rosheee: what cl?
[2022-11-13T03:33:26] rosheee: timings?
[2022-11-13T03:34:05] Artem Bulashev: I check
[2022-11-13T03:40:47] rosheee: highest fire strike i had is 18k but not optimized
[2022-11-13T03:41:00] rosheee: but u can' t change ram timings on laptop üò¢

[2022-11-13T03:43:00] rosheee: oh ^^'
[2022-11-13T03:43:09] rosheee: cl19 worst
[2022-11-13T03:43:14] rosheee: not worst but yah
[2022-11-13T03:43:29] rosheee: but if u not looking for +10cm virtual penis enlargement don't cjhange ram
[2022-11-13T03:44:01] Artem Bulashev: Not planning 64gb is a lot to change and it is not changeable
[2022-11-13T03:44:06] Artem Bulashev: Lol
[2022-11-13T03:44:20] Artem Bulashev: Let‚Äôs stop that computer class for now haha
[2022-11-13T03:44:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: My last intel was with 8700k 5.7ghz overlocked
[2022-11-13T03:44:27] Artem Bulashev: Or not :))
[2022-11-13T03:44:41] Artem Bulashev: I realize I don‚Äôt need cpu power
[2022-11-13T03:44:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Now no more gaming the ryzen 3600 :(
[2022-11-13T03:44:51] Artem Bulashev: I removed cpu boost
[2022-11-13T03:45:00] Artem Bulashev: To give room for gpu
[2022-11-13T03:45:08] Artem Bulashev: Now they have good balance
[2022-11-13T03:45:47] Artem Bulashev: Honestly amazing what it does with 70w total!
[2022-11-13T03:46:21] Artem Bulashev: Cpu limited to 25w - so gpu is constant 45w
[2022-11-13T03:46:24] rosheee: lol 70W XD
[2022-11-13T03:47:03] Artem Bulashev: Yeap lol but yet Gta5 on 1920x1200 on maximum settings 60FPS
[2022-11-13T03:47:27] Artem Bulashev: 50-60FPS ok
[2022-11-13T03:47:29] rosheee: I have laptop i've never used next to me i7 11850H + 32gb ram + nvida quadro t1200
[2022-11-13T03:47:45] rosheee: pc use up to 800-1000W when fully gone benchmarking
[2022-11-13T03:48:24] rosheee: but pff
[2022-11-13T03:48:26] rosheee: wanna sell it
[2022-11-13T03:49:12] Artem Bulashev: :) this guy works from 75w highest I saw between cpu and gpu Very efficient lol, good considering those electricity bills
[2022-11-13T03:49:57] Artem Bulashev: After Liquid Metal CPU idle temp went down from 58c to 44c
[2022-11-13T03:50:02] Artem Bulashev: Nice

[2022-11-13T15:04:41] Mirono escooters: Hey if it works! Thats from llt bms right?
[2022-11-13T15:05:43] Cass: ant smart bms
[2022-11-13T15:06:01] Mirono escooters: Ohh richt
[2022-11-13T15:06:09] Mirono escooters: Mine also ant but old version. I like more
[2022-11-13T15:06:42] Cass: yea yours looks much better
[2022-11-13T15:11:59] Mirono escooters: More work
[2022-11-13T15:18:32] Mirono escooters: Cable management sucks but better then 7 loose cables

[2022-11-13T16:42:57] Artem Bulashev: Ubox 200a single on Alum is testing now as well
[2022-11-13T16:43:21] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6688@13-11-2022_16-43-21.jpg>
[2022-11-13T16:43:21] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6689@13-11-2022_16-43-21.jpg>
[2022-11-13T16:44:25] Artem Bulashev: I believe target is to do 250a (300a max) and 150a battery without cooling
[2022-11-13T16:50:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: Finally something serious
[2022-11-13T16:50:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: But please if possible 2/2.5cm max height
[2022-11-13T16:50:28] Artem Bulashev: I push them for 6awg power with SH8 plug
[2022-11-13T16:50:43] Artem Bulashev: They are trying to keep hight low as you can see yes
[2022-11-13T16:50:55] Mirono escooters: Without?? Jezus
[2022-11-13T16:50:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: Then have vesc for @roscheeee
[2022-11-13T16:51:45] Artem Bulashev: Well 6 fet aluminium does 200a phase and 100a battery no? Without active cooling
[2022-11-13T16:52:37] Artem Bulashev: So 12 fets I think is reasonable to target 280a phase 150a bat, am I wrong?
[2022-11-13T16:53:19] Artem Bulashev: I proposed them to release a line up of 3 power levels vesc
[2022-11-13T16:53:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: Xd release immediately the 12 fet
[2022-11-13T16:53:43] Artem Bulashev: Categories good or no? Ubox S - 6 fet, 3-4oz, cheaper fets (130a phase max, 60a bat max, settings locked) Ubox M - 6 fet, 5oz, best fets (180a phase max, 100a bat max, settings locked) Ubox L - 12 fet, 5-6oz, (300a phase max, 170a bat max)
[2022-11-13T16:55:28] Mirono escooters: Without cooling i doubt?
[2022-11-13T16:56:13] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Oh wow
[2022-11-13T16:56:18] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Good things
[2022-11-13T16:56:27] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: üëç
[2022-11-13T16:57:56] Artem Bulashev: Who has Aluminum flipsky pushed to high temp? What can it do
[2022-11-13T16:58:01] Artem Bulashev: Without active cooling
[2022-11-13T16:59:08] Artem Bulashev: S to do 120-130a phase and 60a battery should be easy even with cheap fets and thinner pcb
[2022-11-13T16:59:52] Artem Bulashev: Ubox M 180a 100a settings, I based it off flipsky experience that is saw, is that too high ?
[2022-11-13T17:56:48] Mirko Boni: Artem, are you producing this?
[2022-11-13T17:59:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: Artem = spintend
[2022-11-13T17:59:21] Mirko Boni: Uaoo! I did not know
[2022-11-13T17:59:22] Mirko Boni: üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ
[2022-11-13T18:05:17] Artem Bulashev: No no
[2022-11-13T18:05:28] Artem Bulashev: I‚Äôm just trying to help Spintend
[2022-11-13T18:05:38] Mirko Boni: Ahh ok ok
[2022-11-13T18:05:56] Artem Bulashev: I‚Äôm not employed, they are the manufacturer I selected to partner for Spin-Y throttle
[2022-11-13T18:06:04] Mirko Boni: After our discussion last night, I'm worried
[2022-11-13T18:06:30] Mirko Boni: Ok I understand Artem
[2022-11-13T18:06:34] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Dont be shy with it
[2022-11-13T18:06:36] Artem Bulashev: And since than I try to help them to get product correctly for what we all want
[2022-11-13T18:07:03] Mirko Boni: I bought the single vesc! But I'm afraid it won't work well
[2022-11-13T18:07:08] Artem Bulashev: Because being in China they have hard time overseeing people desires
[2022-11-13T18:08:06] Mirko Boni: I will have to use a vesc with 70A of battery and 150A of phase
[2022-11-13T18:08:27] Mirko Boni: I'm afraid I bought the wrong product
[2022-11-13T18:09:05] Mirko Boni: Maybe I should have bought a focer vesc!
[2022-11-13T18:09:59] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2022-11-13T18:10:07] Artem Bulashev: What motor ?
[2022-11-13T18:10:22] Mirko Boni: Blade 10 1200w
[2022-11-13T18:10:26] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2022-11-13T18:10:33] Artem Bulashev: Have temp sensor in it ?
[2022-11-13T18:10:54] Mirko Boni: I don't think there is a temperature sensor!
[2022-11-13T18:11:05] Mirko Boni: Or I can fit a vsett 10 engine
[2022-11-13T18:12:09] Artem Bulashev: Which vesc you got?
[2022-11-13T18:12:17] Artem Bulashev: 100v or 75v?
[2022-11-13T18:12:31] Mirko Boni: 75v 100A
[2022-11-13T18:12:58] Mirko Boni: https://spintend.com/collections/frontpage/products/75v-100a-single-esc-single-ubox-based-on-vesc
[2022-11-13T18:14:40] Artem Bulashev: Ok
[2022-11-13T18:15:28] Artem Bulashev: I would recommend - install temp sensor into motor regardless of which motor (10+ is better) - set vesc to 130a phase 50a battery (should be ok) - add thermal pads between pcb and case like shown in blue - remove black paint bottom of the case and escooter body
[2022-11-13T18:16:19] Mirko Boni: Do you think it is better to make an aluminum plate to install the vesc?
[2022-11-13T18:16:19] Mirono escooters: Wiring me temp sensor up rn, very curious how hot my motor i
[2022-11-13T18:16:23] Artem Bulashev: If controller over heats abit than reduce PWM abit, try again. Motor will heat up more, that‚Äôs why sensor recommended. So it‚Äôs balancing tool of sort
[2022-11-13T18:17:17] Artem Bulashev: But you should be able to use this vesc for those settings or close to them ‚úÖ
[2022-11-13T18:17:29] Mirko Boni: Does the engine suffer because it is in single motor?
[2022-11-13T18:17:46] Artem Bulashev: Vsett10+ won‚Äôt care. Blade I don‚Äôt know
[2022-11-13T18:18:00] Mirko Boni: I also bought the fan with the heatsink
[2022-11-13T18:18:29] Mirko Boni: Ok ok perfect
[2022-11-13T18:18:46] Artem Bulashev: That would be last resort, main issue is that a lot of heat goes to pcb, so you need to give phone a way to conduct heat away to the case
[2022-11-13T18:19:29] Mirko Boni: Because I now have a stainless steel lid!
[2022-11-13T18:20:00] Artem Bulashev: Good
[2022-11-13T18:20:05] Artem Bulashev: How thick?
[2022-11-13T18:20:12] Mirko Boni: Do I think aluminum is better than steel?
[2022-11-13T18:20:27] Mirko Boni: Now I measure it!
[2022-11-13T18:21:14] Artem Bulashev: While steel has higher heat resistance, aluminium conducts heat better. In fact, aluminium dissipates heat up to 15 times faster than stainless steel.
[2022-11-13T18:21:46] Mirko Boni: Exactly! In the G30 dual motor I made an aluminum heatsink!

[2022-11-13T18:27:00] Mirko Boni: Yes exactly! The second G30 mounts the single vesc
[2022-11-13T18:27:46] Mirko Boni: Yess exactly
[2022-11-13T18:27:58] sombre_enfant: If u can still cancel i advise to do it... 1zuna had hard time with single 75100
[2022-11-13T18:28:28] Artem Bulashev: Nice
[2022-11-13T18:28:33] Mirko Boni: I bought some pieces on Amazon
[2022-11-13T18:28:47] Mirono escooters: Nono this single vesc diff
[2022-11-13T18:29:02] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_6699@13-11-2022_18-29-02.jpg>
[2022-11-13T18:29:15] Mirko Boni: Exactly
[2022-11-13T18:29:19] Mirono escooters: Smart
[2022-11-13T18:29:30] Mirono escooters: Mirko does badass stuff
[2022-11-13T18:29:34] Mirko Boni: This system works very well
[2022-11-13T18:29:36] Mirono escooters: He gonna beat roschee
[2022-11-13T18:29:37] sombre_enfant: Spinted made second revision of their thing ?
[2022-11-13T18:29:49] Mirono escooters: Nooo They have. 2 versions single vesc
[2022-11-13T18:29:53] Mirko Boni: Thanks @Mirono_escooters
[2022-11-13T18:29:57] Mirono escooters: 1 shit 1 happy and i used and "ok"
[2022-11-13T18:30:18] Mirko Boni: üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ Roger is the best
[2022-11-13T18:30:34] sombre_enfant: Roger too suc√©
[2022-11-13T18:30:40] Mirko Boni: That's right @Mirono_escooters
[2022-11-13T18:31:11] sombre_enfant: Ah ye 1zuna had 100v...but happy wasnt happy with 75v...
[2022-11-13T18:31:59] Mirko Boni: The 100v version is not good! It heats up a lot
[2022-11-13T18:32:13] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse through resin always bad and had bad contact from factory xD double bad
[2022-11-13T18:32:23] Mirono escooters: He was ok, but cooling went brr
[2022-11-13T18:33:06] Mirono escooters: Nop
[2022-11-13T18:33:08] Mirko Boni: @artBula ho misurato la piastra in acciaio inox, 2,5 mm
[2022-11-13T18:33:11] Mirono escooters: Through resin=shit
[2022-11-13T18:33:56] Mirko Boni: The only thing I will do is install a fan and a heatsink
[2022-11-13T18:34:07] Mirono escooters: Nop
[2022-11-13T18:34:15] Mirono escooters: T0-220 mosfets Directly to casing!
[2022-11-13T18:34:26] Artem Bulashev: Of course he is not üòÅüòÅ
[2022-11-13T18:34:35] Mirono escooters: Me too
[2022-11-13T18:34:41] Artem Bulashev: With his demands nonsuprised
[2022-11-13T18:34:50] Mirko Boni: @Mirono_escooters https://spintend.com/collections/diy-electric-scooter-parts/products/12v-mini-fan-with-protection-cover-for-cooling-esc-vesc
[2022-11-13T18:35:11] Artem Bulashev: Well‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs 100a‚Ä¶. It does 100a üòÅüòä
[2022-11-13T18:35:42] Artem Bulashev: Just people expect it to do 150a and than not every one can prepare it to get to 130a
[2022-11-13T18:36:15] Mirono escooters: Better bolt to frame,no need fan
[2022-11-13T18:36:20] Artem Bulashev: Not sure but 120/60a does
[2022-11-13T18:36:51] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-11-13T18:37:08] Artem Bulashev: But who actually uses over 60a for single controller üòÑ
[2022-11-13T18:37:32] Artem Bulashev: 5-10% of people can have such battery
[2022-11-13T18:37:48] Artem Bulashev: That‚Äôs why I push for new line up
[2022-11-13T18:38:03] Mirko Boni: What do you mean by bolt is best by frame?
[2022-11-13T18:38:04] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: It would be harder to sell them
[2022-11-13T18:38:04] Artem Bulashev: With clear S/M/L names
[2022-11-13T18:38:25] Artem Bulashev: Even in this group May be 30%
[2022-11-13T18:38:42] Artem Bulashev: Btw
[2022-11-13T18:38:59] Artem Bulashev: I think M will be more than 180a/100a rated
[2022-11-13T18:39:03] Mirko Boni: I have a 16S. 5P with Sony vtc6a cells
[2022-11-13T18:39:12] Artem Bulashev: I think will go for 200a/120a
[2022-11-13T18:39:46] Mirono escooters: Heyyy ;)
[2022-11-13T18:39:53] Artem Bulashev: L 350a/ 180a
[2022-11-13T18:40:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Me
[2022-11-13T18:40:13] Mirono escooters: Same
[2022-11-13T18:41:03] Mirono escooters: Ebikes need high power Single We rarely do dual
[2022-11-13T18:41:08] Mirono escooters: Escooters way more dual
[2022-11-13T18:41:18] Artem Bulashev: Photo above ;-)
[2022-11-13T18:41:23] Artem Bulashev: True
[2022-11-13T18:43:20] Mirono escooters: Nah i like repair
[2022-11-13T18:43:24] Mirono escooters: Just silicon edges
[2022-11-13T18:44:29] Mirono escooters: True
[2022-11-13T18:46:45] Mirko Boni: However if I had noticed it before I would not have taken spinted but the vesc focer!
[2022-11-13T19:04:58] Artem Bulashev: Just noticed
[2022-11-13T19:05:22] Artem Bulashev: Screw hole
[2022-11-13T19:06:27] Artem Bulashev: 5 screws to ensure good pressure, good thermal paste spread. Looks like Spintend listened :) I advised on 6 fet as well
[2022-11-13T19:06:39] Mirko Boni: Does this overheat in your opinion?
[2022-11-13T19:06:51] Artem Bulashev: May be at 400a phase
[2022-11-13T19:07:06] Mirono escooters: Finally
[2022-11-13T19:07:07] Artem Bulashev: 6fet I expect to do 200a phase with 120a bat
[2022-11-13T19:07:10] Mirko Boni: But when will it go on sale?
[2022-11-13T19:07:34] Mirko Boni: Woow
[2022-11-13T19:09:09] Artem Bulashev: Don‚Äôt know sorry, development recess it tricky, but based on purely what I see, I think big update announcement will be coming in early Dec - new line up of vesc (2 or 3 power levels, each will have 75v and 100v selectable as option) - spin-Y2
[2022-11-13T19:09:39] Mirko Boni: Ok ok thanks Artem
[2022-11-13T19:10:12] Artem Bulashev: M and L for sure. Spintend says S would not be much cheaper than M, not sure it needs separate product with low power
[2022-11-13T19:10:26] Mirono escooters: If price diff small.. ü§∑
[2022-11-13T19:11:54] Artem Bulashev: Yeah maybe other design is needed for S product. Something more simple, more compact, cheaper for such lower power level, 250-800w motors)
[2022-11-13T19:22:15] Mirono escooters: 75v i nstead of 100?
[2022-11-13T19:27:39] Artem Bulashev: Idea was to make each available with 75 and 100v fets
[2022-11-13T19:28:34] Mirono escooters: Aha
[2022-11-13T19:29:05] Artem Bulashev: Because objectively make people won‚Äôt need over 50a battery current and 130 phase ever. So if they can get such lower power with 20$ cheaper it may be great
[2022-11-13T19:29:27] Artem Bulashev: That the idea. But not sure if production cost would be even 20$ cheaper
[2022-11-13T19:33:47] Mirono escooters: Most likely
[2022-11-13T19:33:59] Mirono escooters: 20‚Ç¨ eh, idk

[2022-11-13T23:10:24] Mirono escooters: Vesc doesnt transition to sensorless well
[2022-11-13T23:10:36] Mirono escooters: When i increase sensorless erpm , the brbrbrbr happens later
[2022-11-13T23:11:36] Mirono escooters: It never happend
[2022-11-13T23:11:40] Mirono escooters: Till i did maintenance xD

[2022-11-13T23:14:31] Mirono escooters: Now detected
[2022-11-13T23:14:34] Mirono escooters: I try agaon
[2022-11-13T23:15:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: Without are much more space saved and less power loss
[2022-11-13T23:16:56] Mirono escooters: Same but abit less bad
[2022-11-13T23:17:20] Mirono escooters: With sensorless erpm 300, it wants to go backwards or smth at the sensorless speed
[2022-11-13T23:17:21] Mirono escooters: Bukake
[2022-11-13T23:21:32] Mirono escooters: Listen
[2022-11-13T23:21:44] Mirono escooters: <video_file>
[2022-11-13T23:21:49] Mirono escooters: Worked fine until maintenance xd
[2022-11-13T23:24:00] Mirono escooters: Detection 250a Before 60 ...
[2022-11-13T23:24:57] Mirono escooters: I try sensorless
[2022-11-13T23:26:37] Mirono escooters: Nop not working. At all
[2022-11-13T23:26:44] Mirono escooters: Seems like only senslred works

[2022-11-13T23:40:36] Mirono escooters: With halls it rides until sensorless
[2022-11-13T23:41:18] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-11-13T23:42:33] Mirono escooters: I just did maintenance, and replugged vesc.. reran detection.. now detection gives totally wrong values
[2022-11-13T23:43:42] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-11-13T23:43:51] Mirono escooters: Idk if i saved original settings i could try

[2022-11-13T23:46:20] Mirono escooters: It works with halls until sensorless So.. tf? Before max 600 sensorless erpm Now 2000 ezpz. L
[2022-11-13T23:46:38] Mirono escooters: Something wrong. But i mean. Its 3 phase wires, how wrong can wrong be? Setup is fine
[2022-11-13T23:47:00] Mirono escooters: I rode 60/200 fine before..

[2022-11-13T23:47:24] Mirono escooters: Its not correct with sensorless it doesnt work at all
[2022-11-13T23:47:37] Mirono escooters: Like tf, its like it doesnt know how to drive it. It just makes noise
[2022-11-13T23:48:44] Mirono escooters: Yes diff motor type maybe bugged
[2022-11-13T23:48:49] Mirono escooters: If i go find
[2022-11-13T23:50:17] Mirono escooters: Nop
[2022-11-13T23:50:30] Mirono escooters: I think. Think. I had this before. But can't remember..
[2022-11-13T23:50:56] Mirono escooters: I remember paolo saying "such low resistance impossible bcs magnetic field blabla"
[2022-11-13T23:51:05] Mirono escooters: Idk how i fixed.. i hope just motor setup
[2022-11-14T01:23:34] Mirono escooters: I mean.only difference is cable routing
[2022-11-14T01:24:15] Mirono escooters: I did wrap it around a part of frame 3√ó for testing. As cable was too long. Maybe. I created a inductor. Problably. But if that could be the sole cause.. see tomorrow
[2022-11-14T02:11:30] Mirono escooters: We shall see
[2022-11-14T02:11:37] Mirono escooters: Im just thinking of whats different then last timr

[2022-11-14T17:59:13] Mirono escooters: The firmware from makerx isn't working
[2022-11-14T17:59:36] Mirono escooters: Lol it did spin me motor!!
[2022-11-14T17:59:46] Mirono escooters: Im apperantly too dumb to find 5.2 on github
[2022-11-14T17:59:48] Mirono escooters: If it works. Lets see
[2022-11-14T18:01:19] Mirono escooters: Same motherfucking shit
[2022-11-14T18:01:24] Mirono escooters: When sensorless goes brr
[2022-11-14T18:03:02] Mirono escooters: Again bldc works.. not foc...
[2022-11-14T18:04:46] Mirono escooters: Sensorless foc just doesnt work, at all

[2022-11-14T18:06:46] Mirono escooters: Heres what i do Before i destroy this whole esc, i email makerx. üòä
[2022-11-14T18:43:10] Mirono escooters: Without halls plugged in, it just makes hifh pitch noise on setup motor, it however does do the slow wheel steps
[2022-11-14T18:43:24] Mirono escooters: Pls, let it just bd firmware.. what else can it be. It worked
[2022-11-14T18:54:43] Mirono escooters: Flux linkage detection failed
[2022-11-14T18:54:43] Mirono escooters: <sticker>

[2022-11-14T19:05:58] Mirono escooters: Just, hit me or something
[2022-11-14T19:06:06] Mirono escooters: With a big ass torque arm
[2022-11-14T19:06:48] Mirono escooters: I saw my axle was abit loose Woop, nut loose. Tightened, and removed chain. My ebike arm was touching the chainthing and preventing from going backwards Anyway. It works now. Full foc with halls
[2022-11-14T19:06:54] Mirono escooters: Just. Grr. Something so simple.
[2022-11-14T19:07:01] Mirono escooters: Off to test my cooling Thanks for everyones help
[2022-11-14T19:07:38] Mirono escooters: My best bet is that, the axle was loose, giving bad precise results, and the hard going back made it go doodoo
[2022-11-14T19:07:42] Mirono escooters: Jaj bike works
[2022-11-14T19:31:06] Luis Magalhaes: Thats the problem, maintenance üòÇüòú

[2022-11-14T20:21:29] Mirono escooters: 75100 good and alu pcb
[2022-11-14T20:21:33] Mirono escooters: Rest i dont vouch for
[2022-11-14T20:21:53] Mirono escooters: OwO
[2022-11-14T20:23:07] Mirono escooters: True
[2022-11-14T20:23:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I am always so suprised how you guys do these
[2022-11-14T20:23:25] Mirono escooters: 1500w for 55kmh, seems bit low, or i wrong?
[2022-11-14T20:24:04] Mirono escooters: Cooling is why i stay away from em
[2022-11-14T20:24:18] Mirono escooters: Makerx and community it is
[2022-11-14T20:24:58] Mirono escooters: Yeap
[2022-11-14T20:25:01] Mirono escooters: But ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨ üò¢
[2022-11-14T20:25:42] Mirono escooters: Vesc in general expensive but u pay for quality :)
[2022-11-14T20:25:58] Mirono escooters: Yea, if i ever build motorbike electric i choose those i think
[2022-11-14T20:26:15] Mirono escooters: For now ill keep modding ebike to death xD, i love smooth halls now
[2022-11-14T20:26:40] Mirono escooters: They basic and outdated Except nucular, abit Vesc still miles ahead
[2022-11-14T20:26:51] Mirono escooters: Its not vesc itself, its bad makers+users
[2022-11-14T20:27:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: There ali support is hi dear lvl
[2022-11-14T20:27:46] Mirono escooters: Sometimes
[2022-11-14T20:27:54] Mirono escooters: Thats hardware! :)
[2022-11-14T20:27:57] Mirono escooters: Noise
[2022-11-14T20:28:14] Mirono escooters: Yeaaa, this. Although it can be user error kuch.
[2022-11-14T20:28:24] Mirono escooters: :/
[2022-11-14T20:28:25] Mirono escooters: Sucks
[2022-11-14T20:28:35] Mirono escooters: I still swear by vesc
[2022-11-14T20:29:57] Mirono escooters: Sounds annoying
[2022-11-14T20:32:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Which brand you had this?
[2022-11-14T20:35:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Seen similar,but i dont remember much about it, but that was flypsky
[2022-11-14T20:36:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Mmm interesting
[2022-11-14T20:39:37] Artem Bulashev: Better of eu th ubox dual. Same size but on vesc 6.6, and not 60a
[2022-11-14T20:40:33] Mirono escooters: ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨‚Ç¨
[2022-11-14T20:40:35] Artem Bulashev: Though I guess +85$
[2022-11-14T20:41:25] Mirono escooters: Yeap
[2022-11-14T20:42:35] Artem Bulashev: Add anti spark add 3amp dcdc add separate shipping for adc2 board that you would still need to get standard light features
[2022-11-14T20:42:52] Mirono escooters: I use a 5‚Ç¨ breaker xD
[2022-11-14T20:43:33] Artem Bulashev: That takes a lot of space no?
[2022-11-14T20:43:45] Mirono escooters: Ebike bolted to frame, nop
[2022-11-14T20:43:52] Artem Bulashev: I see ok
[2022-11-14T20:46:10] Artem Bulashev: It‚Äôs 12s max
[2022-11-14T20:46:13] Artem Bulashev: ;))
[2022-11-14T20:47:04] Artem Bulashev: They have one on vesc6 based 250$ - same as ubox price
[2022-11-14T20:47:39] Artem Bulashev: But 12s
[2022-11-14T20:49:25] Mirono escooters: I dont say all their deals are good deals
[2022-11-14T20:49:33] Mirono escooters: For alot of projects good
[2022-11-14T20:49:41] Mirono escooters: My driftkart needs 12s max :)
[2022-11-14T20:50:28] Artem Bulashev: Yeah just seem 250$ too much for 12s when you get 75v for same and on better Hw
[2022-11-14T20:51:33] Jan: Focer 265‚Ç¨
[2022-11-14T20:52:36] Mirono escooters: I know
[2022-11-14T21:56:08] Mirono escooters: He mean on Off i think
[2022-11-14T21:56:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: For Switzerland only :(
[2022-11-14T21:56:17] Mirono escooters: Yea me too
[2022-11-14T21:58:45] Mirono escooters: Belgium takes 25‚Ç¨ just processing it
[2022-11-14T21:59:04] Jan: 35‚Ç¨ processing fee here
[2022-11-14T21:59:26] Mirono escooters: Jezos
[2022-11-14T22:56:27] Artem Bulashev: Belgium posts should take 10
[2022-11-14T22:56:39] Artem Bulashev: 25‚Ç¨ is couriers like Fedex / dhl
[2022-11-14T22:57:16] Artem Bulashev: Post processing is 6-10‚Ç¨ in Austria, unless documents were missing and had to be requested and processed again that is 10‚Ç¨ more
[2022-11-14T22:57:23] Artem Bulashev: Same in switzerland
[2022-11-14T22:57:27] Mirono escooters: Nop they dont
[2022-11-14T22:57:31] Artem Bulashev: I thought it is same EU wide
[2022-11-14T22:57:42] Artem Bulashev: Crazy for post minimal to be 25‚Ç¨
[2022-11-14T23:09:00] Mirono escooters: Sadly not :/
[2022-11-14T23:09:06] Mirono escooters: Then taxes and pft. ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨
[2022-11-14T23:09:08] Mirono escooters: Scammers
[2022-11-15T07:10:43] S1m 0n: as the saying goes? the state is a gang of thieves (I don't know if the translation makes any sense)
[2022-11-15T07:52:15] Gigolo Joe: We run them all day at 70-100a battery and 150 phase, works like a charm, both single and dual setups
[2022-11-15T07:55:53] Jan: MakerX looks decent, however im not sure if they are any good or not. Has anybody tested them? For me controller dimension (height) is not working in my project. Needs to be flat
[2022-11-15T07:56:10] Jan: Agree on this
[2022-11-15T07:57:14] Mirono escooters: Me
[2022-11-15T09:30:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: And need 20s
[2022-11-15T09:42:28] Mirono escooters: Mp2 üòä
[2022-11-15T10:40:15] Artem Bulashev: True
[2022-11-15T10:40:28] Artem Bulashev: I would prefer hight and less surface
[2022-11-15T10:40:44] Artem Bulashev: Not building battery on top of VESC
[2022-11-15T11:00:53] Jan: Same flatness required i guess but lets see
[2022-11-15T19:23:49] asyan4ik: Blade 10 controller
[2022-11-15T19:23:54] asyan4ik: <photos/photo_6719@15-11-2022_19-23-54.jpg>

[2022-11-15T19:24:36] asyan4ik: 75100 white PCB :)
[2022-11-15T20:58:06] Rogerio Figueiredo: Better controller on earth
[2022-11-15T20:58:15] Rogerio Figueiredo: Blade ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2022-11-15T21:01:01] Gigolo Joe: Fyi, Blue pcb has the same ones
[2022-11-15T21:02:00] Gigolo Joe: Also nucular 6 and nucular 12 run the same ones, don't know about nucular 24 as i never opened one
[2022-11-15T21:02:21] Mirono escooters: Must be good/cheap xD
[2022-11-15T21:03:12] Gigolo Joe: Yep, another important thing is to use good drivers for the mosfets
[2022-11-15T21:42:14] Konstantin: Russian scamers ;)))
[2022-11-15T21:42:28] Konstantin: Kelly to;) Probably... Same brand 99%
[2022-11-15T21:42:42] Mirono escooters: Kelly not even close to those companies
[2022-11-15T21:43:21] Gigolo Joe: Yep
[2022-11-15T21:44:15] Gigolo Joe: Those fets are really good considering price/performance/quality
[2022-11-15T21:44:25] Gigolo Joe: Can't agree with that
[2022-11-15T21:44:44] Gigolo Joe: Much better software
[2022-11-15T21:45:01] Gigolo Joe: And better pcb layout
[2022-11-15T21:45:43] Mirono escooters: Indeed. With this crisis rn..
[2022-11-15T21:45:53] Mirono escooters: Problably not much choice
[2022-11-15T21:46:00] Mirono escooters: Check datasheet
[2022-11-15T21:47:25] Mirono escooters: Eh would b negligible
[2022-11-15T21:48:27] Gigolo Joe: U can't just upgrade mosfets to more powerful ones and call it a day They gotta match other components of the pcb for maximum gain
[2022-11-15T21:49:26] Mirono escooters: Haha Xiaomi modding go brr
[2022-11-15T21:54:23] Gigolo Joe: <sticker>
[2022-11-15T21:54:24] Mirono escooters: MDP10N027
[2022-11-15T21:54:52] Gigolo Joe: Lower the zero vector a little bit and voila it heats less
[2022-11-15T21:55:00] Gigolo Joe: <sticker>
[2022-11-15T21:55:34] Mirono escooters: 2.8mohm
[2022-11-15T21:55:42] Mirono escooters: I mean. Theres almost nothing better t0-220
[2022-11-15T21:55:58] Mirono escooters: So idk what we crying about the mosfets, magnachip maybe not best reputatio. But certainly not worst
[2022-11-15T21:56:34] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-11-15T21:56:41] Mirono escooters: 100v 120a
[2022-11-15T21:58:08] Mirono escooters: Pretty damn good
[2022-11-15T22:12:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Kelly uses much worse one, 5.2mOhm
[2022-11-15T22:12:41] Mirono escooters: Oempf
[2022-11-15T22:12:43] Mirono escooters: Thats shit
[2022-11-15T22:12:50] Mirono escooters: Explains why use so many and big heatsink
[2022-11-15T22:27:58] Konstantin: Soso... Nuclear can't spin few motors, vesc can... And you can write all what you need on vesc... Set nuclear, need bullshit display....
[2022-11-15T22:28:33] Mirono escooters: Orr ppl use what they likd
[2022-11-15T22:29:21] Gigolo Joe: Agree on display Vesc can spin few motors because the dual ones are literally 2 controllers fused together
[2022-11-15T22:30:05] Gigolo Joe: Vesc is way easier to work with imo once u know what you're doing
[2022-11-15T22:30:39] Konstantin: Few motor, I mean what some type of motor. Nuclear üé∑üé∂
[2022-11-15T22:31:19] Gigolo Joe: Ok, didn't quite understood you the first timeüëåüèª
[2022-11-15T22:31:27] Konstantin: But y, ppl free to choose, what they want
[2022-11-15T22:32:32] Gigolo Joe: Still nuc24 with qs205 and lipo battery Big pp power
[2022-11-15T22:32:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: Nucular *
[2022-11-15T22:33:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think it‚Äôs even a part vesc based firmware
[2022-11-15T22:33:16] Konstantin: I'm too ;)
[2022-11-15T22:33:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: More or less identical hardware
[2022-11-15T22:33:23] Gigolo Joe: Thought the same
[2022-11-15T22:34:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: I know much thing are different, but they did or anyone will know their secretüòÇ
[2022-11-15T22:34:03] Gigolo Joe: Gotta try read the chip one day on one of those
[2022-11-15T22:34:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: You‚Äôve already firmware
[2022-11-15T22:34:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: But you should able to reverse
[2022-11-15T22:34:46] Gigolo Joe: Not firmware
[2022-11-15T22:34:52] Gigolo Joe: Read the hex
[2022-11-15T22:35:25] Gigolo Joe: To get some deeper understanding on how they implement what does what
[2022-11-15T22:36:15] Gigolo Joe: Same as u do with a bricked vesc when u use stm32 programmer to read/re-write it
[2022-11-15T22:36:46] Gigolo Joe: In example - st link
[2022-11-16T02:59:05] Artem Bulashev: Behold!
[2022-11-16T03:04:21] Artem Bulashev: The ultimate dream for escooter button! Why have I not thought about it earlier ü´£ - left / right momentary = blinkers - center momentary = horn - up with level hold = high beam on, second time off (or what ever you connect to) - down with level hold = low beam on, second time off (or what ever you connect to)
[2022-11-16T03:07:26] Artem Bulashev: The only other function on escooter are - mode switch momentary usually (could use center to cycle thought or left / right) - cruise, already on spin-Y back Any other fiction people do?
[2022-11-16T13:00:42] Mirono escooters: Vesc again 23* after good ride. Normally id be at 60ish, even 80 when i ride agressive
[2022-11-16T13:00:43] Mirono escooters: Succes
[2022-11-16T13:05:52] Martin Kaktits: what do you mean by "normally"
[2022-11-16T13:06:10] Mirono escooters: Without casing
[2022-11-16T13:06:11] Mirono escooters: In a bag
[2022-11-16T13:06:19] Mirono escooters: Without my mod casing**
[2022-11-16T13:06:24] Martin Kaktits: oh, lol, ok. Massive didf, nice
[2022-11-16T13:06:40] Mirono escooters: Yeap well see in Summer
[2022-11-16T15:07:48] Luis Magalhaes: It was a sauna bag üòÇ
[2022-11-16T15:08:12] Mirono escooters: It was pretty toasty lets say that
[2022-11-16T15:08:22] Mirono escooters: Cooling was opening bag on warm day for aircooling
[2022-11-16T15:08:25] Mirono escooters: Didnt work the best
[2022-11-16T15:11:50] Luis Magalhaes: So it was a good upgrade üòÅüí™
[2022-11-16T15:12:05] Mirono escooters: Oh the best
[2022-11-16T15:12:09] Mirono escooters: Now i got unlimited powa
[2022-11-16T15:12:31] Luis Magalhaes: Until batt goes off üòÇ
[2022-11-16T15:12:39] Mirono escooters: And i experience more smooth riding/accel Think that fw helped , its tuned for this esc xD
[2022-11-16T15:12:46] Mirono escooters: :(
[2022-11-16T15:12:51] Mirono escooters: *cries in 1400wh*
[2022-11-16T15:13:04] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: If it has not been voiced before, add such a function for the turn signals for the ADC green board, to the firmware, so that you press the turn signal once, it blinks 3 times, then turns itself off, and if you hold the turn signal button, blinks occur non-stop until the button is released. What do you think?
[2022-11-16T15:15:20] Luis Magalhaes: What batt you have?
[2022-11-16T15:15:57] Mirono escooters: 16s6p lg mj1
[2022-11-16T15:16:04] Mirono escooters: 60a only sadly :/
[2022-11-16T15:22:11] Luis Magalhaes: Similar to my stock wolf but 10P üòÅ
[2022-11-16T15:22:29] Mirono escooters: :(
[2022-11-16T15:22:44] Luis Magalhaes: You need 30t or 40T üòÇ
[2022-11-16T15:22:54] Luis Magalhaes: Or something like that üî•
[2022-11-16T15:22:57] Mirono escooters: I didnt have any space Already went 1p higher then id originally do, and grinded tabs off ebike frame
[2022-11-16T15:23:01] Mirono escooters: Lol my wallet crying
[2022-11-16T15:23:24] Mirono escooters: Problem is this battery so custom i would never be able to do anyth iwth it
[2022-11-16T15:23:28] Luis Magalhaes: Wallet cry so much üòÇ
[2022-11-16T15:23:31] Mirono escooters: And stripping with that copper.. oh no no
[2022-11-16T15:55:19] Mirono escooters: Anyone got ubox v2 unlimited files ?
[2022-11-16T16:03:24] Artem Bulashev: Is there no blinkers on adc2 now?
[2022-11-16T16:03:40] Artem Bulashev: I think blinkers should be part of it yeah
[2022-11-16T16:05:02] Artem Bulashev: Not even those are 7a at best
[2022-11-16T16:05:15] Artem Bulashev: Sag on mj1 at 7a is already nearly too much
[2022-11-16T16:08:12] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6722@16-11-2022_16-08-12.jpg>
[2022-11-16T16:08:20] Artem Bulashev: Turn signals are there
[2022-11-16T16:09:15] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6723@16-11-2022_16-09-15.jpg>
[2022-11-16T16:14:35] Mirono escooters: Since when
[2022-11-16T16:14:55] Mirono escooters: 10a rated, and i monitor sag on ant display. nothing concerning
[2022-11-16T16:31:42] Luis Magalhaes: Some signal lights have blinkers, just have to feed them to battery
[2022-11-16T16:35:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, its there, but what they are, latch or no?
[2022-11-16T16:36:02] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Neutral button means they are in latch mode maybe..
[2022-11-16T16:42:51] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: i.e we have 2 momentary buttons. Only left and right. No neutral
[2022-11-16T16:51:28] Artem Bulashev: Over 10% sag at above 7amp load per cell
[2022-11-16T16:51:39] Artem Bulashev: 60v->54v
[2022-11-16T16:53:41] Artem Bulashev: 35e Samsungs do 10a with 10% sag, mh1 and mj1 do 7-8a before going above 10%
[2022-11-16T16:54:28] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6724@16-11-2022_16-54-28.jpg>
[2022-11-16T16:54:53] Artem Bulashev: 4 to 3.5v at 10a load = 12.5% sag
[2022-11-16T16:56:05] Mirono escooters: I can live with 10% sag, i want oempf

[2022-11-16T16:56:24] Mirono escooters: I got em cheap, so happy
[2022-11-16T16:56:41] Mirono escooters: Ofc no way i pay nkon prices for em xD
[2022-11-16T16:56:48] Artem Bulashev: They will do well for price
[2022-11-16T16:56:49] Artem Bulashev: :)
[2022-11-16T16:56:53] Mirono escooters: Indeed
[2022-11-16T16:56:55] Artem Bulashev: Just not best performer
[2022-11-16T16:57:08] Mirono escooters: And since battery isnt sellable, its until its dead/i replace whole bike
[2022-11-16T16:57:11] Artem Bulashev: That‚Äôs the most popular choice in Chinese scooters
[2022-11-16T16:57:29] Mirono escooters: I can add rack and battery but, vesc at limit of (official) specs anyway. Poor bike not made for it
[2022-11-16T17:41:10] Mirono escooters: Man, id love to have such a stealth bomber ebike with for example makerx controller Seen those bikes? Battery space is huuge compared to any scooter üò≥ and motor space ü§óü§ó
[2022-11-16T17:41:21] Mirono escooters: But 3k+ for a illegal thing , eh

[2022-11-16T17:45:21] Mirono escooters: Jan has experience üòÇ
[2022-11-16T17:46:02] Mirono escooters: Even if u want, cant legalise in belgium. Even if u rebuild a 125cc for example. Its possible in law, but theres 0 certified companies to Do it.. maybe later. I hope
[2022-11-16T17:46:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: Longer life with mj1
[2022-11-16T17:46:25] Mirono escooters: For now illegal ebike go brr. I dont even have a chain anymore . Idk who im tricking but he must be severely blind
[2022-11-16T17:46:40] Mirono escooters: Before i hit 600 ish cycles i think im grandpa
[2022-11-16T17:46:54] Jan: If you obey laws and not endanger anyone, police is usually fair
[2022-11-16T17:47:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: Molicel p42a is like 150-200 cycles
[2022-11-16T17:47:16] Jan: If you go recklessly 120kph through the city, well
[2022-11-16T17:47:42] Jan: thats like 6000-10000km
[2022-11-16T17:47:44] Mirono escooters: Uhhh

[2022-11-16T17:48:12] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse i drive sensible and around ppl/dense areas not fast
[2022-11-16T17:48:17] Mirono escooters: All it takes is 1 shit cop tho
[2022-11-16T17:48:31] Jan: Thats where stealth comes into play
[2022-11-16T17:48:35] Mirono escooters: But yea i passed alot in cars and shit, sometimes thry even look and dont give shit
[2022-11-16T17:48:41] Jan: Build it like it could be stock
[2022-11-16T17:48:49] Mirono escooters: And fake pedal xD But with my wire bukake and big light mods, its becoming obvious
[2022-11-16T17:48:54] Mirono escooters: Impossible
[2022-11-16T17:49:02] Mirono escooters: Battery clearly there, motor is also super visible
[2022-11-16T17:49:07] Mirono escooters: (Ebike)
[2022-11-16T17:49:15] Jan: E bikes are legal right?
[2022-11-16T17:49:25] Mirono escooters: Yea.. 250w..
[2022-11-16T17:49:45] Jan: Yeah just do vesc with switchable profiles
[2022-11-16T17:49:52] Mirono escooters: The 250w are usually front (ieuw) motor or middrive Front just wants to kill you and middrivr is maw 1500w+- for chain reasons
[2022-11-16T17:50:02] Mirono escooters: No ones believing that when u see me ebikr

[2022-11-16T17:50:41] Mirono escooters: U get it
[2022-11-16T17:50:57] Jan: Red light in the front is the first give away for illegal stuff going on
[2022-11-16T17:51:00] Mirono escooters: I wonder, what are consequences of trying to run away? I mean, fleeing is a pretty heavy illegal thing
[2022-11-16T17:51:05] Mirono escooters: XD devils eyes
[2022-11-16T17:51:24] Mirono escooters: When i get stopped, they will take ebike, + some fee, problably But if i run?
[2022-11-16T17:51:27] Jan: The front red lights are already breaking laws
[2022-11-16T17:51:34] Jan: They always get you
[2022-11-16T17:51:36] Mirono escooters: I know my city on my thumb, i give myself 30% change
[2022-11-16T17:51:45] Mirono escooters: And the rest isnt?
[2022-11-16T17:51:52] Mirono escooters: When you go for it, you go well for it
[2022-11-16T17:51:59] Mirono escooters: Twist throttle too, anyway
[2022-11-16T17:52:03] Jan: There is too much going on to look stock
[2022-11-16T17:52:12] Mirono escooters: Yeap so that's impossible
[2022-11-16T17:52:32] Mirono escooters: Im going to make side covers to make it sleeker and less yeet together some stuff But still, clearly modded
[2022-11-16T17:52:53] Jan: I know this guy, he did a full vesc child trailer lol
[2022-11-16T17:53:03] Jan: you cant see that it is an e bike
[2022-11-16T17:53:06] Mirono escooters: When i get stopped i think i just rip cables with my feet, so they cant put it on rollers. But still, what can they do without proof? Idk
[2022-11-16T17:53:09] Mirono escooters: Indeed
[2022-11-16T17:53:17] Mirono escooters: I like the concept xD
[2022-11-16T17:53:31] Jan: The problem is, you will get stopped in the first place because it draws crazy attention
[2022-11-16T17:53:32] Mirono escooters: But for 4kw+, only viable thing is that it has to be visible :/
[2022-11-16T17:53:41] Mirono escooters: I know
[2022-11-16T17:53:43] Jan: or a child trailer ^^
[2022-11-16T17:53:57] Mirono escooters: Well we are 1y later and still nothing, and i do pass wome
[2022-11-16T17:54:07] Mirono escooters: But with every mod im being more scared then ever
[2022-11-16T17:54:22] Jan: ^^
[2022-11-16T17:54:38] Mirono escooters: I think im just collecting illegal things at this point on ebike
[2022-11-16T17:55:09] Mirono escooters: Like, removing my chain 3 days ago was the final legal thing, now i can just pedal in air. Id better just mount feet standers bcs fuck it
[2022-11-16T17:55:34] Mirono escooters: Tidying wiring will help, and the rest.. oh well
[2022-11-16T17:55:49] Mirono escooters: Still dont know changes of fleeing. Its not like u can ask em
[2022-11-16T18:13:59] Mirono escooters: They tried already?

[2022-11-19T20:43:31] Mehmet √ñz: hi ,I bought a new controller Flipsky 75100, I have a problem ,controller gives low current when motor is under load ,whereas I edited the software as high current. i use e-bike ,golden motor magic pie 5 with 75100
[2022-11-19T20:44:31] Mirono escooters: Show, your settings
[2022-11-19T20:44:58] Mehmet √ñz: wait

[2022-11-19T20:57:43] Mirono escooters: 50a?'
[2022-11-19T20:57:44] Mirono escooters: Only??
[2022-11-19T20:57:47] Mirono escooters: Try 120, xD
[2022-11-19T20:58:00] Mirono escooters: And batt current, 100 your batt handles?
[2022-11-19T20:58:09] Mehmet √ñz: Only need 20-25A
[2022-11-19T20:58:42] Mirono escooters: Motor current, 120 Set battery 25
[2022-11-19T20:58:43] Mirono escooters: Try
[2022-11-19T20:59:03] Mehmet √ñz: Okey ,trying
[2022-11-19T21:12:25] Mehmet √ñz: thanks low current problem fixed
[2022-11-19T21:16:00] Mehmet √ñz: but at low speed it draws low current (10km/h 12-15 amps) and high speed draws high amps (20-22 amps at 25km/h)
[2022-11-19T21:18:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also -100 is a lot
[2022-11-19T21:22:27] Mirono escooters: Explain
[2022-11-19T21:25:29] Mehmet √ñz: Continuous full throttle, current increases as you accelerate. current is not constant
[2022-11-19T21:26:23] Mirono escooters: Tell settings

[2022-11-19T21:34:15] Mirono escooters: Batt current rather low
[2022-11-19T21:34:23] asyan4ik: Octtain wait u
[2022-11-19T21:34:26] Mirono escooters: Whats your battery
[2022-11-19T21:34:31] asyan4ik: <photos/photo_6750@19-11-2022_21-34-31.jpg>
[2022-11-19T21:35:46] Mehmet √ñz: 25A
[2022-11-19T21:38:09] Mehmet √ñz: because my battery can supply 25 amps at most
[2022-11-19T21:38:18] Mirono escooters: :/
[2022-11-19T21:41:03] Mehmet √ñz: If I can get full torque, hard start at 0 rpm, I will replace the battery. now i should be able to get what i want from this controller.
[2022-11-19T21:42:00] Mirono escooters: Phase amps are hard start
[2022-11-19T21:46:38] Mehmet √ñz: I did not understand

[2022-11-20T18:15:29] Luis Magalhaes: Doest that snow scooter have battery heating? üòÇ
[2022-11-20T18:15:56] Luis Magalhaes: That's yours?
[2022-11-20T18:17:28] Mirono escooters: I wish
[2022-11-20T18:17:49] Mirono escooters: Thats a interesting topic
[2022-11-20T18:21:17] Mirko Boni: Hi @artBula , I need some help! in the vesc ubox v2 75V is it possible to enable traction control in Esc A and Esc B? I read that if I enable traction in both, the mosfets burst....
[2022-11-20T18:21:24] Luis Magalhaes: In those temperatures i dont know how batt performs
[2022-11-20T18:21:43] Mirono escooters: Battery heater i heard intersting things from
[2022-11-20T18:21:50] Mirono escooters: Cant test since. It doesnt get cold here. :(
[2022-11-20T18:22:16] Luis Magalhaes: Here i can see changes in temperatures like 8¬∞c and 0¬∞C
[2022-11-20T18:22:35] Mirono escooters: I will check for that, with display
[2022-11-20T18:22:38] Luis Magalhaes: In the morning like 6Am
[2022-11-20T18:22:41] Mirono escooters: I do notice more vdrop now with colder temps
[2022-11-20T18:22:44] Mirono escooters: Alittle
[2022-11-20T18:22:52] Luis Magalhaes: Yes thats what i see
[2022-11-20T18:23:37] Luis Magalhaes: Vdrop and if i push it it won't performe the same
[2022-11-20T18:24:00] Mirono escooters: Minimal here
[2022-11-20T18:25:19] Luis Magalhaes: The 30T battery I don't know but when i was using the mj1 battery i see that happening, it suffered more them the external mh1 i had
[2022-11-20T18:25:32] Mirono escooters: Mj1 me have
[2022-11-20T18:25:45] Luis Magalhaes: And the mh1 was a 6P the mj1 was 10P, maybe colder on deck then in bag
[2022-11-20T18:26:20] Mirono escooters: Possible
[2022-11-20T18:26:26] Mirono escooters: Its a big chunk metal needs heating
[2022-11-20T18:26:56] Luis Magalhaes: Good for summer bad for winter üòÇ
[2022-11-20T18:27:34] Mirono escooters: I just want snow to test this stuff ü•≤
[2022-11-20T18:42:02] Mehmet √ñz: for constant current independent of rpm ,I don't think square wave is needed ,I used a kt sine wave controller before, I also used the internal controller (magic pie 5), both were starting with high current. I think it's a mistake to get low current at low rpm with Flipsky 75100 now.
[2022-11-20T18:42:30] Rogerio Figueiredo: Tu n√£o √©s do Alentejo? A√≠ a temperatura m√≠nima s√£o 20 graus
[2022-11-20T18:51:28] Artem Bulashev: Don‚Äôt recommend it, try to reduce phase or battery amps to the point where it nearly doesn‚Äôt sleep, thab adjust curve for the front motor to give optimal throttle at low mid and high without slippage (nearly slipping or minimally slipping) Only Than turn on traction
[2022-11-20T18:51:44] Artem Bulashev: Because tractions seems to be killing controllers more often than not
[2022-11-20T18:51:54] Artem Bulashev: I think in 5.3 it‚Äôs better
[2022-11-20T18:52:27] Mirko Boni: I have 5.3
[2022-11-20T18:52:49] Mirko Boni: But can I enable traction control only on the front engine?
[2022-11-20T18:54:19] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2022-11-20T18:54:26] Artem Bulashev: I would think that is the intended way
[2022-11-20T18:55:13] Mirko Boni: So activating traction control only at the front is safer than activating both engines?
[2022-11-20T18:57:24] Mirono escooters: Traction control rear kinda useless
[2022-11-20T18:58:22] Mirko Boni: Exactly! But I have the ADC module connected to vesc A (rear engine)
[2022-11-20T19:02:18] Luis Magalhaes: i think you can tune the controller for higher demand on trotlle input
[2022-11-20T19:02:38] D J: you are wrong...i like snow and electric scooter too üòÅ

[2022-11-20T19:20:56] Rogerio Figueiredo: Fake news
[2022-11-20T19:21:21] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_6758@20-11-2022_19-21-21.jpg>
[2022-11-20T19:21:25] Luis Magalhaes: 2021
[2022-11-20T19:21:30] Luis Magalhaes: üòÇ
[2022-11-20T19:22:05] Mirono escooters: The main problem with going this way is that it will dive when you brake, because the force going into the caliper is now going the wrong way. All of that mass is going to try to get behind the pivot point during acceleration, making the front end wiggle on the throttle. On the other hand, all of that mass will try to stay in front of the pivot point during braking, making it more stable on the brakes. It should handle big bumps like a champ though.
[2022-11-20T20:04:12] Mirono escooters: Conflicting opinions here
[2022-11-20T20:04:30] Mirono escooters: Am concerned about braking
[2022-11-20T20:08:05] Mirono escooters: Yeap for bumbs makes. Way more sense
[2022-11-20T20:08:14] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2022-11-20T20:08:19] Mirono escooters: Engineering go brr
[2022-11-20T20:10:10] Artem Bulashev: Damm
[2022-11-20T20:10:13] Artem Bulashev: Didn‚Äôt know that
[2022-11-20T20:12:23] Konstantin: my mechanic want make like this for me... improve performance
[2022-11-20T20:14:10] Konstantin: it works alot better
[2022-11-20T20:14:33] Mirono escooters: Ok so looks ugly, is better
[2022-11-20T20:14:46] Mirono escooters: Except braking makes sense
[2022-11-20T20:15:37] Artem Bulashev: My take on this suspention is that - it will be better on bumps - will behave as self centering because wheel hub is behind stem line - looks ugly but functional over all - will not have have negative effect on braking, actually will have positive effect due to trailing position again braking force will be pulling it daters forward while brake is sort of behind (like how stable scooter is with rear brake - doesn‚Äôt wiggle)
[2022-11-20T20:16:06] Artem Bulashev: I would argue it can‚Äôt be worse.
[2022-11-20T20:16:38] Mirono escooters: Weped same design
[2022-11-20T20:16:55] asyan4ik: <sticker>
[2022-11-20T20:17:29] Artem Bulashev: There is one possible downside I see
[2022-11-20T20:17:50] Artem Bulashev: over loading front wheel during braking will be easier
[2022-11-20T20:18:00] Artem Bulashev: But it will be more stable
[2022-11-20T20:18:51] Artem Bulashev: There is one more benefit
[2022-11-20T20:19:09] Artem Bulashev: No creat he‚Äôs up swing arms
[2022-11-20T20:19:18] Artem Bulashev: And less stress on lower swing arm
[2022-11-20T20:19:37] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6759@20-11-2022_20-19-37.jpg>
[2022-11-20T20:19:51] Artem Bulashev: But single high density compression point here
[2022-11-20T20:20:01] Artem Bulashev: Looks thick enough not to fail though
[2022-11-20T20:20:21] Artem Bulashev: I also can imagine
[2022-11-20T20:20:37] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6760@20-11-2022_20-20-37.jpg>
[2022-11-20T20:21:30] Artem Bulashev: Breaking at the red marks over time, but Nami is not casted like most Chinese scooters, those parts are forged, so I would not expect that to happen on it
[2022-11-20T20:31:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_6761@20-11-2022_20-31-00.jpg>
[2022-11-20T20:31:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: This is diecasted
[2022-11-20T20:31:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: Also nami is diecasted, they call it ‚Äúforging‚Äù but it‚Äôs casting
[2022-11-20T20:35:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: As I know nothing company
[2022-11-20T20:36:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Normally the more used is extruding, die casting and cnc milling in our field
[2022-11-20T20:39:41] Jan: Not the best design but its probably fine, i think the stem bolt would snap before that as there is a weird reaction force on the bolt from that suspension geometry.
[2022-11-20T20:41:19] Jan: I know it gets a little hate, but i like the monorim suspension idea the most for now, even if it is not perfectly executed
[2022-11-20T20:41:40] Jan: Same on the GT2
[2022-11-20T20:41:47] Jan: there its inversed monorim
[2022-11-20T20:41:54] Mirono escooters: Gt2 is awesome
[2022-11-20T20:42:17] Jan: Segway GT gets also so much hate
[2022-11-20T20:42:20] Mirono escooters: Monorim suspension doesnt do much For little bumbs. Only big oempf for me
[2022-11-20T20:42:53] Jan: eww Segway 4000$ and it only goes 70kph
[2022-11-20T20:43:02] Jan: "too heavy for the power"
[2022-11-20T20:43:04] Jan: etc
[2022-11-20T20:43:22] Jan: I think its still the best power scooter frame outthere
[2022-11-20T20:43:51] Mirono escooters: Those just uneducated boring ppl
[2022-11-20T20:44:26] Jan: Also the "GET A NAMI!" guys are a bit lol
[2022-11-20T20:44:46] Mirono escooters: Those ppl only love nami and ignore all its obvious problems
[2022-11-20T20:45:58] Jan: I mean the frame is ok, it will probably not break (maybe the stem is too thin but rest is fine)
[2022-11-20T20:46:00] Jan: but
[2022-11-20T20:46:17] Jan: High speed stability is very debatable
[2022-11-20T20:52:39] Jan: Its probably nice for offroad but thats it
[2022-11-20T20:52:51] Jan: Different purpose that i am looking for
[2022-11-20T20:53:16] Jan: I wont carry anything a floor over 20kg daily
[2022-11-20T20:53:32] Jan: The G30 will be 34kg with the new motors
[2022-11-20T20:53:38] Jan: super compact and small but heavy af
[2022-11-20T20:53:58] Stan: It‚Äôs crap tried my friends one with no steering dampener wobbles at 55kph
[2022-11-20T20:55:27] Stan: I set his rebound to low and still wobbles like a mf he later got a steering dampener and it‚Äôs better but still for the price unacceptable engineering
[2022-11-20T20:57:16] Jan: I think thats the tradeoff, soft => tends to wobble
[2022-11-20T20:57:39] Jan: Wheel position and caster angle are super critical
[2022-11-20T20:57:47] Jan: Will do some experiments
[2022-11-20T20:58:00] Jan: Then CAD a High speed monorim
[2022-11-20T21:01:32] Jan: Cannot say a lot about trail, looks like any other scooter. Folding mechanism is a stemclamp, so its worst. I dont know how the stem is attached to the deck. Kaboo had it with 4 screws lol. Maybe here its better, i cant see
[2022-11-20T21:02:32] asyan4ik: @roscheeee ????
[2022-11-20T21:03:09] Mirono escooters: Defenitiely him
[2022-11-20T21:03:28] Mehmet √ñz: hi ,i will try firmware 6.0 beta , can use 3.01 vesc tool?
[2022-11-20T21:03:46] Jan: This guy in the video has too much safety gear for @roscheeee 's taste üòù
[2022-11-20T21:04:45] Jan: >100kph yes
[2022-11-20T21:05:47] Jan: Not integral, more in this style
[2022-11-20T21:06:26] Jan: I'll buy him so kevlar sweatpants ^^
[2022-11-20T21:07:33] Jan: true
[2022-11-20T21:08:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: New motors üî•
[2022-11-20T21:08:52] Jan: Xiaomi 350W motors ^^ ?
[2022-11-20T21:09:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: Monorim 500w
[2022-11-20T21:14:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_6767@20-11-2022_21-14-00.jpg>
[2022-11-20T21:14:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: World better suspension
[2022-11-20T21:15:56] Jan: <sticker>
[2022-11-20T21:16:44] Mirono escooters: Lol i wanna give making a suspension a go later on, but that looks horrible even to my standards
[2022-11-20T21:35:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: Let‚Äôs try to fix

[2022-11-20T21:55:42] Jan: how heavy?
[2022-11-20T21:58:52] Luis Magalhaes: This would be you on wolf+kelly üòÇüòÇüòÇüòú
[2022-11-20T22:01:06] Luis Magalhaes: Thats like those sharkbite or wtf they name it üòÇ

[2022-11-20T22:04:38] D J: Looks good!
[2022-11-20T22:56:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: Flipsky vs TRONIC
[2022-11-20T22:57:33] Mirono escooters: Both blow up, no difference there
[2022-11-20T22:59:27] Mirono escooters: Theres a top piece missing on flipsky. Thats only power board
[2022-11-20T23:00:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: Even so naked hahaha
[2022-11-20T23:02:30] Mirono escooters: Kinda both
[2022-11-20T23:02:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: Both miss much components
[2022-11-20T23:02:42] Mirono escooters: Integrated Bluetooth is 1 Flipsky removing components is 2
[2022-11-20T23:02:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: Original design much more components
[2022-11-20T23:03:05] Mirono escooters: Where the tronic MOSFETs drivers?
[2022-11-20T23:06:41] Jan: <photos/photo_6772@20-11-2022_23-06-41.jpg>
[2022-11-20T23:07:54] Mirono escooters: 6 fet only
[2022-11-20T23:09:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_6773@20-11-2022_23-09-41.jpg>
[2022-11-20T23:09:56] Mirono escooters: That small???
[2022-11-20T23:10:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, maybe that why fet are that unstable and always blow up
[2022-11-20T23:12:05] Mirono escooters: Looks way to small to me
[2022-11-20T23:20:09] Jan: They are fine at 10kW, just dont use traction control
[2022-11-20T23:21:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Will see how flipsky perform with wolf warrior
[2022-11-20T23:21:52] Jan: 5kph with traction control
[2022-11-20T23:22:12] Jan: After hours at 10kW
[2022-11-20T23:22:28] Mirono escooters: Looks fine to me üòä
[2022-11-20T23:22:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is not because traction control
[2022-11-20T23:22:35] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2022-11-20T23:22:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: Controllers was working already at limit
[2022-11-20T23:22:54] Mirono escooters: Poor controller
[2022-11-20T23:23:01] Jan: At 5kph pressing a bit on the throttle = limit?
[2022-11-20T23:23:01] Mirono escooters: It must not have liked 10kw
[2022-11-20T23:23:12] Jan: It did not happen at 10kW
[2022-11-20T23:23:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: He says full throttle
[2022-11-20T23:23:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: These mosfet driver are no good
[2022-11-20T23:23:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: So small :)
[2022-11-20T23:23:48] Mirono escooters: Thats what i think too
[2022-11-20T23:23:57] Jan: The power cuts on the OTHER esc when the erpm difference gets too much. WHY?
[2022-11-20T23:24:40] Jan: I do not understand double esc traction control at this point. Why would it cut power to zero?
[2022-11-20T23:24:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: I always used traction control , never problems . Only benefit
[2022-11-20T23:25:08] Jan: How many esc?
[2022-11-20T23:25:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt know I used it only with own vesc, that followed original vesc hardware design
[2022-11-20T23:25:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: No shitteria with micro drivers
[2022-11-20T23:25:54] Jan: Ok
[2022-11-20T23:26:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: Could be just hardware design issue
[2022-11-20T23:26:33] Jan: If there is any other controller that can withstand the power and is not higher than 10mm, let me know
[2022-11-20T23:27:48] Mirono escooters: Mp2?
[2022-11-20T23:28:16] Jan: Mp2?
[2022-11-20T23:28:45] Mirono escooters: The community vesc
[2022-11-20T23:28:50] Mirono escooters: 18 fet big joy
[2022-11-20T23:30:51] Mirono escooters: https://github.com/badgineer/CCC_ESC
[2022-11-20T23:31:03] Mirono escooters: Size problably too big. Since bluepill chip sticks out abit
[2022-11-20T23:35:51] Jan: If its over 15mm, its out
[2022-11-20T23:36:05] Jan: I dont care if its 500mm long
[2022-11-20T23:36:44] Jan: A cube is just the worst shape for any project
[2022-11-20T23:37:59] Jan: For any scooter you want nice dense packaging
[2022-11-20T23:38:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: New spintend could to it I think
[2022-11-20T23:39:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: But next year
[2022-11-20T23:40:55] Jan: I will do the cooler
[2022-11-20T23:41:17] Jan: Already have an idea for more efficiency
[2022-11-20T23:42:40] Jan: @roscheeee
[2022-11-20T23:42:58] Jan: Traction control makes it heat up way faster
[2022-11-20T23:43:34] Luis Magalhaes: I used ubox on mine for some time üòÇ
[2022-11-20T23:45:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: At low kmh / rpm, when you full press the throttle is the time when the higher current is pushed , more ampere than when you full throttle at 100
[2022-11-20T23:46:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2022-11-20T23:50:28] Jan: Rear
[2022-11-20T23:50:38] Jan: The controller had set limit
[2022-11-20T23:51:36] Jan: Hmm maybe because the front is shut off, way too much power from the bat goes to rear
[2022-11-20T23:51:47] Jan: Maybe 300-500battery amps?
[2022-11-20T23:52:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: 300A phase current is enough to burn it
[2022-11-20T23:57:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: this
[2022-11-20T23:57:32] Mirono escooters: That
[2022-11-20T23:57:46] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but don't know about height yet
[2022-11-20T23:57:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: need to assemble first
[2022-11-20T23:58:00] Mirono escooters: Well with bluepill high If we could put it on board then low
[2022-11-20T23:58:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: dumb idea but couldn't we put the pill under the board? I mean there is nothing anyway?
[2022-11-20T23:58:42] Mirono escooters: Lol i like dumb ideas
[2022-11-20T23:58:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: not sure if MOSFETs height enough to fit pill
[2022-11-20T23:59:03] Mirono escooters: Problably not
[2022-11-21T00:00:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Actually. It is.
[2022-11-21T00:00:49] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: When U remove the headers and solder the pill directly on the bottom board
[2022-11-21T00:00:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: it would take away zero space
[2022-11-21T00:00:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Literally zero space
[2022-11-21T00:03:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: For even more saving on height you could use cables on the pin outs instead of the connector sockets
[2022-11-21T00:05:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: hmm but DC DC converter is big boi
[2022-11-21T00:06:03] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but could be placed somewhere else with cables
[2022-11-21T00:10:04] Mirono escooters: Messy tho
[2022-11-21T12:58:18] Artem Bulashev: I told you they skip half the components
[2022-11-21T12:58:28] Artem Bulashev: See alum Ubox I posted before
[2022-11-21T12:58:56] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6776@21-11-2022_12-58-56.jpg>
[2022-11-21T13:17:27] Konstantin: Y, but they has minimum, for ride... I don't need gyro, Bluetooth not a problem. Soft start switch - easy, 3a 12v... For few diodes... Aux..etc..
[2022-11-21T13:18:21] Konstantin: Last 100/100 balls, missed üî©, and 130g useless cooper...
[2022-11-21T13:18:24] Konstantin: Ok...
[2022-11-21T13:20:17] Artem Bulashev: 3amp continues dc-dc from 100v to 12v are not easy to find in good size and good price, they usually heat up a lot as well
[2022-11-21T13:21:54] Artem Bulashev: Yeah it that 100/100 ubox single is a half designed half made product indeed
[2022-11-21T13:22:28] Artem Bulashev: It‚Äôs like we swim in shit üëå
[2022-11-21T13:29:15] Artem Bulashev: Yeah the only wish I still have is to have anoption to make it taller and less surface (put capacitors Up vertically) but won‚Äôt be possible on that one as logic occupies more space than FlipSky for proper design reason and extra things like 3amp dc dc
[2022-11-21T13:29:34] Artem Bulashev: What you mean ? Photos?
[2022-11-21T13:34:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: It is shit, like Weped Fold series, tried all, it's a perfect suspension to be ejected from the scooter when hard braking. But 90+% of people don't ride hard and never brakes hard so everybody think it's good üòÇ
[2022-11-21T13:37:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: I blown like 5 Focer (same as tronic) and all have been used at 10+KW and it always blown at low speed except for one at 90Kmh üòÇ It's not about traction control it's about poor little fets being overused with high currents
[2022-11-21T13:38:20] Face de Pin Suc√©: But we all have to know that @roscheeee BMS is completely useless A proper BMS cuts way before destroying a board like that
[2022-11-21T13:40:14] Konstantin: Bms need only for charge;) for discharge need only few ‚ö†Ô∏èüö®.
[2022-11-21T13:42:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: Good mosfet piloting need also Suce drive
[2022-11-21T13:55:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: ?
[2022-11-21T14:01:00] Konstantin: Sometimes, when bms do cut off, esc don't like it.... Fuse+ magic, and fly üöÄ...fly...
[2022-11-21T14:05:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: BMS never cuts off for no reason
[2022-11-21T14:06:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: All my flipskys that died because of malfunctioning BMS software üòµ‚Äçüí´
[2022-11-21T14:08:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: well only MOSFETs but yeah was annoying
[2022-11-21T14:09:19] Konstantin: Good bms - take a lot of space, cost amount of dollars... Search photo....
[2022-11-21T14:09:51] Konstantin: –ü–æ—á—Ç–∏ –Ω–µ—Ç —Ä–∞–∑–Ω–∏—Ü—ã ;)
[2022-11-21T14:10:15] Konstantin: Llt/LLT/daly
[2022-11-21T14:10:17] Jan: Any better bms?
[2022-11-21T14:11:14] Konstantin: <photos/photo_6778@21-11-2022_14-11-14.jpg>
[2022-11-21T14:11:16] Jan: 20kW application, preferred flat footprint
[2022-11-21T14:11:20] Konstantin: Ant / llt
[2022-11-21T14:12:17] Jan: I would need 300A battery
[2022-11-21T14:12:18] Konstantin: Fuse + logic by can to vesc and fly....
[2022-11-21T14:12:25] Artem Bulashev: Hm
[2022-11-21T14:12:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: I use ANT which is good Only once had a cut because setted 300A and peaked at 400A
[2022-11-21T14:13:16] Artem Bulashev: I never noticed soldering issue on Spintend before, what controller you saw that on? (Beside solder balls, that are now rare on new products)
[2022-11-21T14:13:27] Jan: The 300A BMS?
[2022-11-21T14:14:12] Artem Bulashev: It is not continuous rating
[2022-11-21T14:14:27] Artem Bulashev: 300a ant BMS is is 120a continuous I think
[2022-11-21T14:14:35] Jan: Ok than i need bigger
[2022-11-21T14:14:39] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, it depends of cooling mostly
[2022-11-21T14:14:42] Jan: 500A or so
[2022-11-21T14:14:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, but there's 400A that is very good
[2022-11-21T14:15:05] Artem Bulashev: What are you building ?
[2022-11-21T14:15:13] Artem Bulashev: 500amps god
[2022-11-21T14:15:14] Jan: Second G30
[2022-11-21T14:15:20] Artem Bulashev: ‚Ä¶.
[2022-11-21T14:15:24] Jan: P45B
[2022-11-21T14:15:25] Artem Bulashev: ü§£ü§£ü§£
[2022-11-21T14:15:34] Face de Pin Suc√©: 300A one will be enough for your use honestly
[2022-11-21T14:15:50] Jan: 20s6p again
[2022-11-21T14:15:58] Artem Bulashev: Are you kidding ?
[2022-11-21T14:16:02] Artem Bulashev: What motor ?
[2022-11-21T14:16:03] Face de Pin Suc√©: Even with big 75mm dual motor I never overheated it
[2022-11-21T14:16:04] Jan: 300A discharge
[2022-11-21T14:16:37] Artem Bulashev: It will only be a let to do 210a continues
[2022-11-21T14:16:51] Artem Bulashev: It will over heat quickly above
[2022-11-21T14:16:57] Jan: Nobody ever uses continuous in scooter applications
[2022-11-21T14:17:13] Artem Bulashev: Yes I know
[2022-11-21T14:17:26] Artem Bulashev: Continues I mean 5-7min non stop
[2022-11-21T14:17:31] Artem Bulashev: Like high way use
[2022-11-21T14:17:31] Jan: Ok
[2022-11-21T14:17:39] Jan: üòÖ
[2022-11-21T14:17:44] Artem Bulashev: 35a is all it can do
[2022-11-21T14:17:52] Artem Bulashev: 45a will over heat it with in 1min
[2022-11-21T14:17:56] Jan: Trailblazing on a highway 120kph non stop for 7min
[2022-11-21T14:17:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: Power falls at max speed
[2022-11-21T14:18:01] Jan: Not going to happen
[2022-11-21T14:18:31] Artem Bulashev: Depends, not on all setups
[2022-11-21T14:18:50] Artem Bulashev: Also what will you use to weld it?
[2022-11-21T14:18:50] Face de Pin Suc√©: Then it's not max speed
[2022-11-21T14:19:18] Artem Bulashev: Even 0.2mm copper will barely be enough for 35a, and if all in single line
[2022-11-21T14:19:58] Artem Bulashev: Welding 0.25mm copper May be not possible with normal tools
[2022-11-21T14:20:13] Artem Bulashev: Fair point
[2022-11-21T14:22:04] Artem Bulashev: Will need like dual xt150 output I guess at least
[2022-11-21T14:22:30] Artem Bulashev: Or May be 8mm bullet will do
[2022-11-21T15:00:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: worst case is contiuous climb at 'max' speed, no ?
[2022-11-21T15:01:14] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes absolutely
[2022-11-21T15:01:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: Hill races are worst case
[2022-11-21T15:01:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: so, i wouldn't say it's never used
[2022-11-21T15:01:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: mountain rides exists üòâ
[2022-11-21T15:02:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: Power needs to be adjusted to the use
[2022-11-21T15:02:23] Mirono escooters: My poor ebike
[2022-11-21T15:03:02] Mirono escooters: Me go from 60a to 45a max speed. Still alot but defenitiely noticeably
[2022-11-21T15:03:08] Mirono escooters: Good indicator ur at max speed
[2022-11-21T18:31:37] Mirono escooters: 40khz max for vesc? Got good cooling now
[2022-11-21T18:57:10] Artem Bulashev: Not sure
[2022-11-21T18:57:22] Artem Bulashev: Isn‚Äôt it 35 max recommended ?
[2022-11-21T18:57:49] Artem Bulashev: Ideal is to use 8th
[2022-11-21T18:57:57] Artem Bulashev: Vesc pwm is half of zero value
[2022-11-21T18:58:12] Artem Bulashev: So if you set 16 that is 8khz pwm
[2022-11-21T18:58:27] Artem Bulashev: 32 would be 16khz
[2022-11-21T18:58:30] Artem Bulashev: Ideal
[2022-11-21T19:00:28] Mirono escooters: Whats it default?
[2022-11-21T19:01:17] Mirono escooters: 30 vector default
[2022-11-21T19:01:30] Mirono escooters: Why? Default isnt even that
[2022-11-21T19:01:56] Mirono escooters: Btw found info that vesc supports up to 150khz ? (75khz pwm)
[2022-11-21T19:01:56] Mirono escooters: ‚ÄúMax reliable frequency is 30Khz with V7 or 60Khz without it‚Äù
[2022-11-21T19:01:57] Mirono escooters: ‚Äúnew feature in the firmware let the PWM frequency be a multiple of the control loop so you can have 100 kHz PWM and 20 kHz current control.‚Äù
[2022-11-21T19:01:59] Mirono escooters: Old chat
[2022-11-21T19:05:16] Mirono escooters: Ill go ask makerx what their recommended max is
[2022-11-21T19:05:30] Mirono escooters: Whats even worst case? MOSFETs blow or just do weird?
[2022-11-21T19:05:43] Mirono escooters: If Xiaomi can do 32khz zero vectorüò≥
[2022-11-21T19:06:23] Konstantin: <photos/photo_6779@21-11-2022_19-06-23.jpg>
[2022-11-21T19:06:27] Mirono escooters: I mean, 30khz zero vector is already quiet and shit Its just, less motor heat is what i need, vesc now ultra low temp
[2022-11-21T19:06:35] Konstantin: Ubox single 30... stock....
[2022-11-21T19:07:33] Mirono escooters: Seems default vesc
[2022-11-21T19:12:37] Jan: Other question, are there any flat Vescs out there or in development? Can be 2separate ones over CAN or single one for two motors. ~20kW (20-24s) Only requirement, height < 17mm
[2022-11-21T19:13:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: New alu pcb ubox
[2022-11-21T19:13:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: In development
[2022-11-21T19:13:47] Jan: Design from @artBula / @SibClimb / @PaoloWu ? :D
[2022-11-21T19:14:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: No
[2022-11-21T19:14:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: From spintend
[2022-11-21T19:14:22] Mirko Boni: <video_file>
[2022-11-21T19:14:47] Jan: ok, i hope they dont fuck up the cooling ^^
[2022-11-21T19:14:51] Artem Bulashev: Try higher 24khz pwm, 48khz setting might be better
[2022-11-21T19:15:01] Jan: I just need the fets on one side
[2022-11-21T19:15:20] Jan: Any pictures of new Spintend alu vesc?
[2022-11-21T19:15:23] Artem Bulashev: Those things have resonances and specific ranges that can not coexist with specific motors
[2022-11-21T19:15:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: We decided to made our design for continuos intense use, so it it‚Äôs bigger
[2022-11-21T19:15:33] Artem Bulashev: Posted above
[2022-11-21T19:16:26] Jan: ok thanks
[2022-11-21T19:16:57] Jan: I hope its this, 2x 25kWüòù
[2022-11-21T19:16:57] Jan: Behold!
[2022-11-21T19:17:04] Artem Bulashev: Wonder why they use round numbers
[2022-11-21T19:17:31] Artem Bulashev: Pwm best works at 8th frequencies as far as I know
[2022-11-21T19:17:58] Jan: ok nice
[2022-11-21T19:17:58] Jan: <photos/photo_6688@13-11-2022_16-43-21.jpg>
[2022-11-21T19:18:11] Jan: Any expected pricing ?
[2022-11-21T19:18:11] Jan: <photos/photo_6689@13-11-2022_16-43-21.jpg>
[2022-11-21T19:19:11] Artem Bulashev: Flipsky competition
[2022-11-21T19:19:17] Jan: k
[2022-11-21T19:19:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think will be about 200‚Ç¨ around
[2022-11-21T19:19:46] Jan: Thats the single vesc right?
[2022-11-21T19:20:15] Artem Bulashev: I would guess abit over that value due to built in on/off switch that flip sells separately and 3-4amp dc-dc and other futures
[2022-11-21T19:20:52] Artem Bulashev: They will be good big step in right direction
[2022-11-21T19:21:42] Artem Bulashev: that‚Äôs 96 kHz setting
[2022-11-21T19:22:07] Artem Bulashev: I don‚Äôt think any ubox can live with that at high loads
[2022-11-21T19:22:18] Artem Bulashev: That should be possible indeed
[2022-11-21T19:24:11] Jan: Yes
[2022-11-21T19:26:21] Jan: Any dimensions yet?
[2022-11-21T19:26:28] Jan: So i can cad that
[2022-11-21T19:28:30] Jan: If the cooling is less needed, than 3mm alu lasercut is enough
[2022-11-21T19:29:20] Jan: with ANT bms could reduce spacer with floor from 40mm (outside) to 18-23mm
[2022-11-21T19:29:48] Jan: With an even stronger/safer setup
[2022-11-21T19:30:15] Jan: 20s6p P45B
[2022-11-21T19:30:55] Jan: ANT 500A
[2022-11-21T19:31:02] Jan: But its only 250A cont rated
[2022-11-21T19:31:07] Jan: I need 300A
[2022-11-21T19:31:15] Jan: But maybe works
[2022-11-21T19:33:08] Artem Bulashev: Not yet
[2022-11-21T19:33:22] Artem Bulashev: It is still in testing and optimizing phase
[2022-11-21T19:33:59] Artem Bulashev: They asked me not to share dimentions yet as they may change things around
[2022-11-21T19:34:22] Jan: JK
[2022-11-21T19:36:16] Jan: ANT
[2022-11-21T19:37:10] Jan: ANT 205x70x16 250A / 500A JK 162x102x20 200A / 350A
[2022-11-21T19:37:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: But why lol, continuos use means for more day without stop, like for powerwall. Your battery at this current can work like 5/10 min continuously , way no sense .
[2022-11-21T19:39:16] Konstantin: Llt top
[2022-11-21T19:39:19] Jan: Or 30s4p config and go for less amps ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2022-11-21T19:40:02] Jan: 120cells max 20s6p 24s5p 30s4p
[2022-11-21T19:40:34] Konstantin: ;) forever;) use them 6+y all OK. + Very much Info... Like simple logging all data. Cell / average... Best setting + Information...
[2022-11-21T19:40:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Your reasoning is wrong, efficiency will be much lower, and bms will be even bigger because FET of same size will support half of current . Same for the controller
[2022-11-21T19:41:01] Jan: True
[2022-11-21T19:41:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: So 20s60 with ant 300A is more than enough
[2022-11-21T19:41:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Or maybe 400A if you really love big bms
[2022-11-21T19:42:35] Jan: For racetrack use?
[2022-11-21T19:43:16] Jan: 300A is 30mm than 400A and 400A is 30mm shorter than 500A
[2022-11-21T19:43:35] Jan: I will have a look how long the new spintend esc is
[2022-11-21T19:43:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, problem will be controllers
[2022-11-21T19:44:00] Mirono escooters: But what's (theoretical) max? Not bcs vesc support it it will work tho?
[2022-11-21T19:44:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: Bms current will bigger when higher speed
[2022-11-21T19:44:02] Konstantin: For racing need another solution... Coming probably soon, need finish 1 project, sell it, and then...
[2022-11-21T19:44:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: In track you‚Äôve more phase current peaks, so controller is the more stressed part
[2022-11-21T19:44:27] Mirono escooters: Go drift
[2022-11-21T19:44:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: Motor too
[2022-11-21T19:45:12] Jan: Hmm i have 415x120mm. Height the less the better
[2022-11-21T19:45:53] Jan: Too big
[2022-11-21T19:46:01] Jan: 25is too much
[2022-11-21T19:46:32] Jan: Daly is 20already
[2022-11-21T19:46:39] Jan: 16mm
[2022-11-21T19:47:06] Konstantin: No, choose llt
[2022-11-21T19:47:12] Konstantin: More power
[2022-11-21T19:47:33] Konstantin: More stable... More software+hardware protection
[2022-11-21T19:47:46] Jan: Daly 212x95x20
[2022-11-21T19:47:53] Mirono escooters: Go ant bms, it handles way over rating and heatsink pretty damn good
[2022-11-21T19:48:11] Jan: Probably 400A ANT
[2022-11-21T19:48:11] Mirono escooters: Llt?? Stabler then ant?
[2022-11-21T19:48:25] Konstantin: <photos/photo_6785@21-11-2022_19-48-25.jpg>
[2022-11-21T19:48:54] Konstantin: Toll8 fets
[2022-11-21T19:49:09] Jan: 25mm is out for me
[2022-11-21T19:49:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: Jk best
[2022-11-21T19:49:48] Jan: 23mm spacer compared to the 40mm will be a huge packing pain
[2022-11-21T19:49:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: Can‚Äôt fit in g30 :(
[2022-11-21T19:50:03] Artem Bulashev: 50mm tall!!?? üòÄüòÄ
[2022-11-21T19:50:20] Artem Bulashev: Huge
[2022-11-21T19:50:29] Artem Bulashev: Better of with jK
[2022-11-21T19:53:01] Artem Bulashev: Skip BMS on discharge for racing
[2022-11-21T19:53:42] Artem Bulashev: Use charge only - any amps rating BMS there for that can fit of your S count
[2022-11-21T19:53:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: There is like motor, the declared current not always like real current
[2022-11-21T19:53:53] Artem Bulashev: Or use BMS with vesc integration
[2022-11-21T19:54:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: This is jk 150A bms
[2022-11-21T19:55:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: 21 MOS 3.4mOhm (typical), same capability like ant 400A
[2022-11-21T19:56:16] Artem Bulashev: Those tiny copper rods give me chills
[2022-11-21T19:56:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: And 1A balance with inside Bluetooth
[2022-11-21T19:56:23] Artem Bulashev: It‚Äôs on an other level of quality
[2022-11-21T19:56:39] Artem Bulashev: 2amp on top version
[2022-11-21T19:57:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Problem is just can‚Äôt fit in g30 üòÇ
[2022-11-21T19:57:53] Artem Bulashev: People that build BMS and vesc say it‚Äôs a lot harder for some reason to design good BMS than good vesc
[2022-11-21T19:58:30] Mirono escooters: Who needs that much anyway
[2022-11-21T19:59:24] Artem Bulashev: People with 100ah packs at home
[2022-11-21T19:59:39] Artem Bulashev: Power walls are their main target market
[2022-11-21T19:59:49] Mirono escooters: I mean in scooter
[2022-11-21T19:59:55] Mirono escooters: Powerwall yea i got 2a too
[2022-11-21T20:00:17] Artem Bulashev: Yeah
[2022-11-21T20:00:27] Artem Bulashev: 500ma is more than we need :)
[2022-11-21T20:00:41] Mirono escooters: 160 even
[2022-11-21T20:00:49] Mirono escooters: My balancing didnt turn on in a month i think xD
[2022-11-21T20:01:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: Jk balance only 2 cell together
[2022-11-21T20:01:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: So it‚Äôs not that fast how you think
[2022-11-21T20:02:10] Artem Bulashev: Same though hard to notice it
[2022-11-21T20:02:15] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6787@21-11-2022_20-02-15.jpg>
[2022-11-21T20:02:32] Artem Bulashev: 0.004mv when ever I check my pack
[2022-11-21T20:02:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: What app is this ?
[2022-11-21T20:02:50] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6788@21-11-2022_20-02-50.jpg>
[2022-11-21T20:03:08] Artem Bulashev: The only app that allows to configure new LLT BMS on iPhones
[2022-11-21T20:03:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: With which bms
[2022-11-21T20:03:15] Artem Bulashev: Beside one in WeChat
[2022-11-21T20:03:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Oh ok
[2022-11-21T20:04:18] Artem Bulashev: I can still do 10km on that ü´£üòÅüòÅ
[2022-11-21T20:05:07] Artem Bulashev: My son plays on my phone
[2022-11-21T20:05:21] Mirono escooters: Same max 0.008v i saw yet
[2022-11-21T20:05:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: Daly no balance function üòÇ
[2022-11-21T20:05:56] Artem Bulashev: Daly = stupid in my book
[2022-11-21T20:06:04] Mirono escooters: Daly poopoo only 30mah charge balance And it acts like powerwall BMS
[2022-11-21T20:06:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: But @AJAJ1992 like it :(
[2022-11-21T20:06:20] Mirono escooters: Ban him
[2022-11-21T20:06:28] Artem Bulashev: I‚Äôm sure there are many people that like it
[2022-11-21T20:06:37] Artem Bulashev: It‚Äôs red
[2022-11-21T20:06:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: Was mine favorite too when beginner
[2022-11-21T20:06:45] Jan: im open to any BMS that has better performance
[2022-11-21T20:06:52] Jan: i dont care if its more expensive
[2022-11-21T20:06:59] Mirono escooters: Daly at bottom of performance book for me
[2022-11-21T20:07:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: But when you do much battery you will get how shit it‚Äôs
[2022-11-21T20:07:35] Jan: There are two thing hard to find life: -Something decent for the money -The best in existance no matter the price
[2022-11-21T20:07:41] Artem Bulashev: I always choose 1. JKBMS 2. LLT 3. ant In that order until I find the one that fits dimentions at needed power level
[2022-11-21T20:07:56] Artem Bulashev: LLT is always best price
[2022-11-21T20:08:12] Artem Bulashev: Always smart
[2022-11-21T20:08:17] Mirono escooters: Also customer service sucks Order 2 bmses from official story Get send from some aftermarket seller with their logo on it. I forgot name 1 dead out of box, didnt read 1 row Plugged in second, its Bluetooth module dead. Tried from first, that one worked No help at all, overpriced bs
[2022-11-21T20:08:25] Artem Bulashev: I Never use non smart BMS
[2022-11-21T20:08:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: Best is rele bms
[2022-11-21T20:08:49] Mirono escooters: 1: ant bms 2: llt 3: jkbms For me
[2022-11-21T20:09:09] Mirono escooters: Considering everything, especially money. Jkbms I like but its usually bit more expensive
[2022-11-21T20:09:17] Mirono escooters: I like ant 8-22s universal xD makes job ez
[2022-11-21T20:09:24] Artem Bulashev: I find ant to be bigger and more expensive usually, beside one or two units
[2022-11-21T20:09:32] Jan: 20mm JKBMS is probably out
[2022-11-21T20:09:43] Jan: depends on final new vesc height
[2022-11-21T20:10:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: Whut, jk is much smaller than Daly
[2022-11-21T20:10:16] Jan: Daly is 20mm as well
[2022-11-21T20:10:45] Mirono escooters: I only order 1 from em fits 90% projects and cheap. Its also habit, i know their quality and wiring from head, and app Its like every weekend same grocery store
[2022-11-21T20:10:47] Jan: i dont care the footprint as long as it is flat
[2022-11-21T20:11:11] Artem Bulashev: Why?
[2022-11-21T20:11:38] Artem Bulashev: What if it is thinner but has one space that goes up to 20mm, is it not better?
[2022-11-21T20:12:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: Oh I thought you have the version with the fan
[2022-11-21T20:12:15] Jan: no
[2022-11-21T20:14:24] Jan: I think i need to get cables left and right next to bms. So it should be less than 100mm wide. Length is 415mm with 2x Vescs. (If the vesc have sticking out caps and they are less than 70mm width than can be up to 480mm i think)
[2022-11-21T20:33:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Jk is made for motorcycle
[2022-11-21T20:34:37] Mirono escooters: Ant bms has nice motorcycle display But sad they don't bother making speed display work on newer bms.üôÑ
[2022-11-21T20:36:18] Mirono escooters: The display has a hall sensor Input wire, and display has kmh display thing In bms configure tire settings and it should work But display freezes when i try Their answer: "we didnt try on new BMS Version" Thanks. Why advertise it then
[2022-11-21T20:36:52] Mirono escooters: Still useful for batt % (i ran out of power alot before) and batt temp, cells Voltage, blabla. But pitty i wanted to see speed
[2022-11-21T20:37:02] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_6789@21-11-2022_20-37-02.jpg>
[2022-11-21T20:38:44] Mirono escooters: This is how kmh would look+other info
[2022-11-21T20:39:07] Mirono escooters: Was a replacement for non existing vesc display xD
[2022-11-21T20:39:18] Mirono escooters: And im not that desperate to see speed to install flipsky display üôä
[2022-11-21T20:39:33] Artem Bulashev: That is one ugly ass screen
[2022-11-21T20:39:52] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2022-11-21T20:40:02] Artem Bulashev: Yeah looks like Tv from 2006
[2022-11-21T20:40:10] Mirono escooters: Its simple and 15‚Ç¨ xD
[2022-11-21T20:40:19] Mirono escooters: How much time u look at display anyway at 60kmh
[2022-11-21T20:40:38] Mirono escooters: I just need to know before i go out i have battery left, and for fun see sag and Amps I'm pulling.
[2022-11-21T20:40:38] Artem Bulashev: For 15‚Ç¨ that is practically free
[2022-11-21T20:40:44] Mirono escooters: Indeed
[2022-11-21T20:41:01] Mirono escooters: I have no chain, so i cant even pedal home anymore xD
[2022-11-21T20:42:11] Mirono escooters: Not too bad i see no kmh anyway since i like the other display more. Bigger v and a reading. Other model need to find with magnifier glassü•≤
[2022-11-21T20:43:07] Jan: Not much but a lot when its standing still
[2022-11-21T20:45:48] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse then
[2022-11-21T20:45:55] Mirono escooters: So then I check batt and temps
[2022-11-21T20:46:02] Mirono escooters: And when riding for fun amps and sag
[2022-11-21T21:07:39] Gigolo Joe: Been there, done that
[2022-11-21T22:07:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: considering the number of good vesc vs good bms we have on the market, i seriously doubt that.
[2022-11-21T22:08:26] Artem Bulashev: Me too
[2022-11-21T22:08:48] Artem Bulashev: But than again we don‚Äôt see solder balls in BMS
[2022-11-21T22:08:53] Artem Bulashev: But all the time in the vesc
[2022-11-21T22:09:07] Artem Bulashev: Sooo looks more like QC / skill issue
[2022-11-22T04:06:24] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6791@22-11-2022_04-06-24.jpg>
[2022-11-22T04:06:24] Artem Bulashev: Size of 12 fet Ubox Alum. And they said they will consider selling Naked version, without case üëåüôÇ
[2022-11-22T11:45:02] Artem Bulashev: Just under the size of Ubox Dual
[2022-11-22T11:55:59] Jan: Looking forward
[2022-11-22T11:56:39] Jan: G30 with 20s6p 400 A ANT BMS 2x new spintend alu vesc Only 20mm spacer
[2022-11-22T12:11:16] Artem Bulashev: I see no reason why this nearly same power stage could not be converted into Dual on a later date
[2022-11-22T12:20:00] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Why not
[2022-11-22T12:21:37] Artem Bulashev: I proposed to try that = same case = less expensive
[2022-11-22T14:47:02] Artem Bulashev: Holly shit guys
[2022-11-22T14:47:06] Artem Bulashev: Look at this
[2022-11-22T14:47:10] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6793@22-11-2022_14-47-10.jpg>
[2022-11-22T14:47:59] Artem Bulashev: Black is the first test of new design magnet üß≤üòÖüòÖüòÖ it is a touch too weak / too far, but look how smooth and linear the output is üòÑüòÑ
[2022-11-22T14:48:27] Artem Bulashev: Compare to other designs I tried before üëåüëå
[2022-11-22T14:49:10] Jan: Is this spin-y throttle response curve?
[2022-11-22T14:49:27] Jan: What am i seeing here?
[2022-11-22T15:18:51] Artem Bulashev: Yea
[2022-11-22T15:19:10] Artem Bulashev: Different magnet designs for spin-y / spin-y2
[2022-11-22T15:21:25] Artem Bulashev: Black is the newest magnet too weak but curve is just f strait as an arrow, and that is based on 19 measuring points! Other colors are old dual magnet design that just didn‚Äôt work as i expected (was Spintend original solution from v1 remote, vs black my own magnet design)
[2022-11-22T15:29:11] Artem Bulashev: Response curve is identical
[2022-11-22T15:31:11] Artem Bulashev: Output is identical, with identical dead zones and curve, difference is that remote used only with vesc and has output processing to send signal over radio.
[2022-11-22T15:31:55] Artem Bulashev: On vesc it is less apparent and yeah lower power scooters mainly used v1 remote as throttle
[2022-11-22T16:42:36] Artem Bulashev: Have you don‚Äôt calibration ?
[2022-11-22T16:43:09] Artem Bulashev: Because some people drive it on 10+ stock controller and like it
[2022-11-22T16:43:52] Artem Bulashev: I would not, but some do apparently
[2022-11-22T16:44:17] Artem Bulashev: It does
[2022-11-22T16:44:35] Mirono escooters: In vesc you can set middle point then u can cheat and make it non linear
[2022-11-22T16:45:01] Artem Bulashev: But regardless v2 will be miles ahead
[2022-11-22T16:51:16] Artem Bulashev: I promised a perfect throttle, but in a hurry, allowed to be produced before fully testing my self (trust that Spintend would test basic functionality, but we know now they didn‚Äôt go beyond ‚Äúit moves ok‚Äù)
[2022-11-22T16:55:10] Mirono escooters: Spintend always dissapoint me
[2022-11-22T16:56:07] Artem Bulashev: And I failed to see magnet design flaw that Spintend was using originally as I was not knowledgeable enough on dual magnet system and how magnetic field changes in specific case. Sucks but at least it pushes me to study and design new system that works amazingly in preliminary testing already
[2022-11-22T16:56:38] Mirono escooters: Basic things they miss/dont do. Just, potential. Missed potential
[2022-11-22T16:56:39] Artem Bulashev: I think they are good, but they are missing one more person that would be checking their work
[2022-11-22T16:56:55] Mirono escooters: Indeed. Potential but wasting it and some simple things are being missed
[2022-11-22T16:58:35] Artem Bulashev: It‚Äôs like they have only one head of electrical engineer, very narrow skill set, and because of that they miss a lot of points or make silly mistakes that any low level physicist would spot right away
[2022-11-22T16:59:04] Artem Bulashev: That is true yes
[2022-11-22T16:59:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_6794@22-11-2022_16-59-31.jpg>
[2022-11-22T17:00:17] Mirono escooters: I also see em as serious contender but, the basic mistakes (in my eyes..) idk. I see makerx above em. Flipsky is debatable (pls not)
[2022-11-22T17:00:56] Artem Bulashev: I think they experience problems with scaling
[2022-11-22T17:01:01] Mirono escooters: Well even i know basic stuff they miss, or atleast check. Like the brass heatsink xD
[2022-11-22T17:01:10] Artem Bulashev: They need to grow their staff
[2022-11-22T17:01:42] Artem Bulashev: But don‚Äôt do that because they can do the job nearly but always fail without that ‚Äúsecond head‚Äù to watch over
[2022-11-22T17:01:49] Artem Bulashev: That‚Äôs what I try to do
[2022-11-22T17:02:05] Mirono escooters: I have and posted internal design
[2022-11-22T17:02:10] Artem Bulashev: Little things like proper alum pcb mounting with screw in the middle and 4 corners
[2022-11-22T17:02:17] Mirono escooters: G300 is üíö
[2022-11-22T17:02:27] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6795@22-11-2022_17-02-27.jpg>
[2022-11-22T17:02:49] Artem Bulashev: They used to be total shit
[2022-11-22T17:03:00] Artem Bulashev: But don‚Äôt know anything about new line up they released
[2022-11-22T17:03:02] Mirono escooters: Ps, no resin directfets, with proper cooling and case, stay super cool, low price, and handles alot
[2022-11-22T17:03:21] Face de Pin Suc√©: Have you tried already ?
[2022-11-22T17:03:23] Mirono escooters: Makerx is my nr1 now actually xD
[2022-11-22T17:03:40] Mirono escooters: I wish. Just looking and hearing from ppl using it :/ My bike has no point for it. Need bigger
[2022-11-22T17:04:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: I ordered one but not shipped yet, I'm about to cancel my order
[2022-11-22T17:04:35] Mirono escooters: Actually nr1 vesc producer is ofcourse badgineer
[2022-11-22T17:04:39] Mirono escooters: Why
[2022-11-22T17:05:23] Mirono escooters: When i make big motorcycle someday it will be community or makerx, for now
[2022-11-22T17:06:48] Mirono escooters: Yeap but i want to see results first
[2022-11-22T17:07:52] Artem Bulashev: Well electrical is all on them. But they do that well on their own always
[2022-11-22T17:08:11] Mirono escooters: Finally
[2022-11-22T17:08:19] Mirono escooters: Ubox was great Then went down, xD
[2022-11-22T17:08:43] Mirono escooters: Yea
[2022-11-22T17:08:51] Artem Bulashev: This heating solution is well tested now, so only remaining question is ‚Äúproduction to the high standard‚Äù that‚Äôs what I try push them to archive.
[2022-11-22T17:08:51] Mirono escooters: And thermal
[2022-11-22T17:09:02] Mirono escooters: And no solderballs. Pls.
[2022-11-22T17:09:08] Artem Bulashev: Thermal is already taken care of so should be ok
[2022-11-22T17:09:25] Artem Bulashev: Yes I already told John about this -
[2022-11-22T17:10:11] Artem Bulashev: <photos/photo_6796@22-11-2022_17-10-11.jpg>
[2022-11-22T17:10:26] Artem Bulashev: That soldering that like this will result in ALOT of solder balls
[2022-11-22T17:10:35] Artem Bulashev: To be careful
[2022-11-22T17:10:37] Artem Bulashev: But
[2022-11-22T17:10:46] Artem Bulashev: Logic won‚Äôt be soldered on
[2022-11-22T17:10:57] Artem Bulashev: So it will be free of solder balls.
[2022-11-22T17:11:14] Artem Bulashev: And we can inspect power board easily on top side only üëç
[2022-11-22T17:11:49] Artem Bulashev: This photo is only for testing Logic board - it used 1oz copper power board here :)
[2022-11-22T17:12:15] Artem Bulashev: You don‚Äôt ultrasonicly solder Alfa versions
[2022-11-22T17:12:46] Artem Bulashev: Dual 6 fet is not yet in the design btw
[2022-11-22T17:13:05] Artem Bulashev: But I already pitched it to him to make it on same case / pcb size as 12 fet
[2022-11-22T17:13:22] Artem Bulashev: Not yet
[2022-11-22T17:13:35] Artem Bulashev: But it is logical to move dual to Alum Design in future
[2022-11-22T17:14:21] Artem Bulashev: Yeah but not 220a phase / 120a battery good - which is what single alum will be able to do without issues
[2022-11-22T17:15:00] Mirono escooters: Wait until you see soldering of community vesc lolol
[2022-11-22T17:16:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: Because 400$ sleeping and already a week late
[2022-11-22T17:16:57] Mirono escooters: Its high demand i saw
[2022-11-22T17:17:37] Mirono escooters: Indeed
[2022-11-22T17:17:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: They said new batch 15/11 and it's 22/11 and nothing shipped yet
[2022-11-22T17:18:26] Mirono escooters: I got the nudes of my makerx somewhere xD
[2022-11-22T17:18:39] Face de Pin Suc√©: To be honest I ordered while waiting my prototypes, but if it's not shipped in 5 days, I'll cancel, or maybe someone interested here to buy at full price x)
[2022-11-22T17:19:27] Mirono escooters: MOSFETs of hi100
[2022-11-22T17:20:37] Mirono escooters: Here
[2022-11-22T17:21:43] Mirono escooters: Cooling on die directly no stupid resin, and with a good heatsink (this one tbh stayed pretty "cool". But i needed oempf) it stays 26* max xD
[2022-11-22T17:22:05] Mirono escooters: 60/200a and 45a continuous, 70-80* in a Wildman bag without cooling
[2022-11-22T17:27:21] Artem Bulashev: I will ask for dimention. Yeah that is what flipsky can do in real life, so no reason for Spintend won‚Äôt be able.
[2022-11-22T17:28:02] Mirono escooters: Talking about Community vesc

[2022-11-22T17:39:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: I just used 4 small point of glue
[2022-11-22T17:39:30] Mirono escooters: Thats gonna hold?
[2022-11-22T17:39:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, this glue is very strong
[2022-11-22T17:49:12] Mirono escooters: Smort

[2022-11-22T19:37:57] Mirono escooters: Nono wait
[2022-11-22T19:38:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: If made with right fet I think it can do 180A battery and 300 phase too
[2022-11-22T19:38:56] Face de Pin Suc√©: Send me first üòã
[2022-11-22T19:41:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: even if you pay the list price?üòÇ

[2022-11-23T07:22:29] SirGeoff: No, but why did you connect the two pin and three pin connector together?
[2022-11-23T07:22:47] SirGeoff: They are the 12V supply connectors.
[2022-11-23T07:23:29] Kevin: 2 pin is running direct to fan, 3 pin to Ubox
[2022-11-23T07:26:01] SirGeoff: Ok. How much current do you consume on the 12V line? (Just an idea wether to overload it or not)
[2022-11-23T11:44:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Looks shorted

[2022-11-23T13:42:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But how is this possible, no antispark?
[2022-11-23T13:47:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: üôàohhh and sad ,i Always keep 8 eyes out for all this shit
[2022-11-23T14:27:05] Artem Bulashev: Over loaded 12v bus?
[2022-11-23T14:27:24] Artem Bulashev: Or short circuite due to something
[2022-11-23T14:27:28] Kevin: No idea waiting to hear back from spintend they don‚Äôt know
[2022-11-23T14:27:46] Kevin: I followed their instructions
[2022-11-23T14:28:15] Kevin: <photos/photo_6804@23-11-2022_14-28-15.jpg>
[2022-11-23T14:28:42] Artem Bulashev: The only way this can do that is if wiring is wrong or something conductive shorted it
[2022-11-23T14:29:02] Artem Bulashev: Make sure you didn‚Äôt reverse wires
[2022-11-23T14:29:12] Kevin: This time I might just splice the 12v fan directly to the cable pluging into Ubox and insulate the entire Adc adapter
[2022-11-23T14:29:26] Kevin: Yeah I double checked all that
[2022-11-23T14:30:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: That seems voltage regulator
[2022-11-23T14:32:09] Artem Bulashev: You think so? Like 3v step down from 5v ?
[2022-11-23T14:32:29] Artem Bulashev: Looks like part of throttle circuitry
[2022-11-23T14:35:24] Gordan Gizdic: This works? Anyone tested?
[2022-11-23T14:37:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: I ordered another 5 board to test, but you can‚Äôt turn on/off it without smart bms
[2022-11-23T14:38:17] Mirono escooters: Or antispark or breaker
[2022-11-23T14:38:17] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2022-11-23T14:42:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: I will use a simple as150 connector
[2022-11-23T15:22:53] Rogerio Figueiredo: Why not?
[2022-11-23T15:23:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: You‚Äôve no on off button üòÇ
[2022-11-23T15:23:28] Rogerio Figueiredo: I connect and disconnect the battery
[2022-11-23T15:23:37] Rogerio Figueiredo: I make a serial cable
[2022-11-23T15:24:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: With xt90?
[2022-11-23T15:24:12] Mirono escooters: Indeed. Good
[2022-11-23T15:24:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Xt90 after some times you do it , the resistor will fail
[2022-11-23T15:24:50] Rogerio Figueiredo: Xt60
[2022-11-23T15:25:03] Mirono escooters: Since when
[2022-11-23T15:26:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: No antispark so
[2022-11-23T15:26:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt know but xt90s sucks

[2022-11-23T17:36:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: This is the one with outside cutts?
[2022-11-23T17:37:41] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Antispark ones
[2022-11-23T17:39:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Not really sure what that's needed at all at phases
[2022-11-23T17:39:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I ment the outside look of it is cutted
[2022-11-23T17:39:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: <photos/photo_6805@23-11-2022_17-39-59.jpg>
[2022-11-23T17:41:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Outside is the bigger and cutted I actually dont use any of this type As and if it gets hot will surly get loose coz its designed like that ,the other way around ones better if mounted correctly
[2022-11-23T17:41:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Maybe used better word
[2022-11-23T17:45:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But as you like ,unsure if you get what i was trying to say
[2022-11-23T17:47:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Near all When i ment antispark above, i ment the module what flipsky and makersbase sells also for there products to be able to safe turn on and off Unsure what he did above since spin has this by default,looks more like a screwdriver touch ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2022-11-23T17:51:03] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: They both good, xt150 and as150
[2022-11-23T17:51:11] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: No problem at all
[2022-11-23T17:51:25] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But i use it only on phases
[2022-11-23T17:51:57] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Battery i use xt60-90, xt120, as300, qs8, qs10
[2022-11-23T17:53:35] Artem Bulashev: Yeah to compensate for loss of contact curface that is occupied by added resistor that does anyispark job
[2022-11-23T17:54:17] Artem Bulashev: Qs8 qs10 are awesome
[2022-11-23T17:56:28] Gordan Gizdic: QS8 are great also. 200A nominal, will hold short term up to 600A.
[2022-11-23T18:07:02] Artem Bulashev: Yes

[2022-11-24T07:12:45] Face de Pin Suc√©: Same
[2022-11-24T18:24:37] rosheee: Bms didnt done anything it was traction control

[2022-11-24T18:46:11] Face de Pin Suc√©: BMS should have cut before destruction
[2022-11-24T18:46:54] Mirono escooters: Its daly soo
[2022-11-24T18:47:00] Mirono escooters: Overcurrent protection non existent xD
[2022-11-24T19:05:00] rosheee: Lol
[2022-11-24T19:05:08] rosheee: How should bms cut
[2022-11-24T19:05:16] rosheee: When it back emf to mosfets?
[2022-11-24T19:05:31] rosheee: It is tronics fault
[2022-11-24T19:05:35] rosheee: Not daly
[2022-11-24T19:05:53] rosheee: Happened at not even 100A battery
[2022-11-24T19:05:55] rosheee: Lol
[2022-11-24T19:11:46] rosheee: Inset bms to 410A max discharge
[2022-11-24T19:11:49] rosheee: So where bms cut?
[2022-11-24T19:11:55] Mirono escooters: 410?? Jezos

[2022-11-24T19:16:22] Mirko Boni: @roscheeee l traction control in vesc A now works fine
[2022-11-24T19:24:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: when the mosfet blows, it is short-circuited, if your BMS triggers quick, it only blows the mosfet, not the entire PCB, trust me, I blowed fets at more than 500A and this never happened, because BMS triggers at very high speed
[2022-11-24T19:25:08] rosheee: Then why mosfet blew at 20kmh not even 10% throttle?
[2022-11-24T19:25:21] rosheee: I dont care if shit blew out
[2022-11-24T19:25:32] rosheee: Btw why dis now topic?
[2022-11-24T19:25:41] rosheee: Spintend never blew btw
[2022-11-24T19:25:57] rosheee: Mosfet burned so hard 2nd time that pcb burned
[2022-11-24T19:26:59] rosheee: Did Gal3on wrote u?
[2022-11-24T19:27:19] rosheee: It had hardc8re hole Bit if it burns it burns
[2022-11-24T19:27:32] rosheee: Why even possible taking that much amps?
[2022-11-24T19:27:45] rosheee: Firmware is blocked at 100A
[2022-11-24T19:29:08] rosheee: Buy them at ali and solder
[2022-11-24T19:35:10] Mirono escooters: I got crimping tool but soldering extensions to signal cables/5v low power cables no problemo
[2022-11-24T19:51:09] rosheee: Crimp for the rich Solder the true fuckeria

[2022-11-25T00:03:37] Artem Bulashev: Kind of makes me want it as turn signals though :))
[2022-11-25T00:03:40] Mirono escooters: Thats pretty nifty
[2022-11-25T00:06:10] Gordan Gizdic: Was thinking about it but this led requires a lot of power and that complicates things. Im already using 2 buck converters to power the osram light and this led strip.
[2022-11-25T00:11:15] Gordan Gizdic: But!
[2022-11-25T00:11:44] Gordan Gizdic: I could use 2 smaller strips on the side. That would help a lot with visibility during turns.
[2022-11-25T00:11:47] Gordan Gizdic: Hmmm...
[2022-11-25T00:11:55] Gordan Gizdic: Thnx for the idea. üòÅ

[2022-11-25T08:49:57] Mirono escooters: I would guess 90 is max of your motors? What you hit in air?
[2022-11-25T08:50:06] Mirono escooters: Or more battery oempf. Wind resistance
[2022-11-25T08:50:06] Kevin: 130
[2022-11-25T08:50:12] Mirono escooters: Then batt amp

[2022-11-25T09:05:19] Mirono escooters: You cutted back
[2022-11-25T09:05:32] Mirono escooters: Do longer

[2022-11-25T09:55:42] Kevin: What should temps sit at during full cycle?
[2022-11-25T09:57:08] Kevin: Hasn‚Äôt gone above 70 luckily. I put thermalright extreme Odysses pads in vesc and use big aluminium heatsink with fan ontop too
[2022-11-25T09:57:16] Kevin: <photos/photo_6815@25-11-2022_09-57-16.jpg>
[2022-11-25T09:57:21] Kevin: Any recommendation ?
[2022-11-25T09:58:17] Mirono escooters: Fan wont do much
[2022-11-25T09:58:30] Mirono escooters: Thermalepaste and good contact frame
[2022-11-25T09:59:07] Kevin: Fan make loud fuck boi noise

[2022-11-25T09:59:16] Kevin: Link brand pls x
[2022-11-25T09:59:48] Mirono escooters: Better just to frame
[2022-11-25T09:59:51] Mirono escooters: Frame big heatsink
[2022-11-25T09:59:55] Jan: 40¬∞C
[2022-11-25T10:00:54] Jan: Lol please no fans, you blow it just into the scooter where i cant go anywhere, its also not efficient
[2022-11-25T10:01:24] Jan: You have the best fan in the world on a scooter (the air that passes your scooter when driving) so please use this instead
[2022-11-25T10:03:33] Jan: An example without any fans whatsoever, very simple efficient cooling method. (6fet Rion tronic esc)
[2022-11-25T10:04:15] Jan: <video_file>
[2022-11-25T10:04:22] Kevin: Okay I take off fan thank you :)
[2022-11-25T10:06:49] Jan: Fets directly on an aluminum floorplate
[2022-11-25T10:06:51] Jan: Thats it
[2022-11-25T10:07:05] Jan: With a very thin thermal pad between
[2022-11-25T10:07:11] Gordan Gizdic: I dont think you got the point. Taking off the fan wont do much. You need to evacuate the heat away from esc and theres a problem with your setup because its not mounted to any reasonable cooling surface. That heatsink you have is not transfering heat to outside fresh air.
[2022-11-25T10:07:28] Mirono escooters: Bolt to frame..
[2022-11-25T10:07:56] Gordan Gizdic: Yes, to some metal surface, than heatsing on top of that.
[2022-11-25T10:08:40] Gordan Gizdic: Like this.
[2022-11-25T10:09:00] Gordan Gizdic: <video_file>

[2022-11-25T10:32:36] Kevin: Oh I see thank you :)
[2022-11-25T10:33:07] Konstantin: Not safe, but can increase duty, 95 to 99
[2022-11-25T10:33:10] Kevin: We‚Äôre not allowed to go faster than people riding kangaroos
[2022-11-25T10:33:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Riding kangaroos? Lol This whole gets interesting
[2022-11-25T10:33:54] Gordan Gizdic: Than give kangaroos some speed.
[2022-11-25T10:34:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Here 5 year old kids race with 50 cc pocketbikes
[2022-11-25T10:34:16] Kevin: No but really it‚Äôs the most bullshit laws here. $1000 fine for using phone while riding, $350 for doubling with someone, $350 for speeding, $350 for not wearing helmet, $350 for not having a bell
[2022-11-25T10:34:32] Kevin: The politicians here are soft cocks
[2022-11-25T10:34:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Lol ,crazy

[2022-11-25T10:37:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: These laws are up on a bike also? Or what's there speed limit in the path?
[2022-11-25T10:38:04] Kevin: Bicycles can do what they want
[2022-11-25T10:38:09] Kevin: They fly past us doing 50km
[2022-11-25T10:38:14] Kevin: And they can ride on rode

[2022-11-25T10:39:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What about Ebike's ?
[2022-11-25T10:39:44] Jan: Cant you just add mini pedals (as axle sliders) to the rear axis and call it an ebike?
[2022-11-25T10:40:50] Kevin: E-bikes are hit and miss, usually cops can‚Äôt tell
[2022-11-25T10:41:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Lets wait what's his answer, Rules with does and non for bike , probably would make me change to ebike Or as he said run for president
[2022-11-25T10:41:06] Kevin: More so the scooters are cracked down
[2022-11-25T10:41:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Than üòè

[2022-11-25T13:37:14] S1m 0n: in Germany we have IO Hawk who market the Vsett 10. Maybe they will have the needed spare part "soon". at least with the kaabo Mantis 10 they have many spare parts and mostly cheaper than with Ali. but so far the vsetts division is still relatively empty

[2022-11-25T21:07:17] Gordan Gizdic: From there it goes to adapter and than to stock lights and stuff.
[2022-11-25T21:12:07] Gordan Gizdic: Ah, i get it now, it could be...
[2022-11-25T21:12:25] Gordan Gizdic: Yeah, its not controlling + side but negative side.
[2022-11-25T21:12:31] Gordan Gizdic: That could be the issues.
[2022-11-25T21:12:36] Gordan Gizdic: Issue*
[2022-11-25T21:12:42] Gordan Gizdic: Ill let you know.
[2022-11-25T21:14:22] Gordan Gizdic: Nope, they dont work.
[2022-11-25T21:14:25] Gordan Gizdic: Damn!
[2022-11-25T21:14:34] Gordan Gizdic: Now i gotta fuck with that also.
[2022-11-25T21:22:45] Gordan Gizdic: Brake lights work.
[2022-11-25T21:22:58] Gordan Gizdic: For some reason rear blinkers are on also.
[2022-11-25T21:23:31] Gordan Gizdic: Argh.
[2022-11-25T21:41:16] Unknown: Believe there are nuts on the bottom
[2022-11-25T21:42:28] Unknown: How do the L/R buttons work? Momentary?
[2022-11-25T21:43:51] Gordan Gizdic: Classis switch. Pushed is closed, open i open.
[2022-11-25T21:43:56] Gordan Gizdic: If that makes sense?
[2022-11-25T21:48:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I had similar problem, till i didn't used proper wired switch for lights and indicator/ horn I mean china cheap ones have few wires only, proper one all wired separeted
[2022-11-25T21:49:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I throw that away alsoüòÖ
[2022-11-25T21:49:20] Unknown: Push on/ push off and then green bar shows blinker is on.
[2022-11-25T21:49:36] Gordan Gizdic: So the cluster is controlling the signal with 3.3v?
[2022-11-25T21:49:41] Gordan Gizdic: Weird i got to say.
[2022-11-25T21:50:04] Gordan Gizdic: 3.3v is on the input side.
[2022-11-25T21:50:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Not momentary ,stays sadly
[2022-11-25T21:50:21] Gordan Gizdic: Documentation says it should be 12v
[2022-11-25T21:51:02] Gordan Gizdic: <photos/photo_6838@25-11-2022_21-51-02.jpg>
[2022-11-25T21:51:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I think your problems are the same
[2022-11-25T21:51:19] Gordan Gizdic: Possibly, i need to check this a bit.
[2022-11-25T21:51:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I tried this and its a joke

[2022-11-25T21:51:39] Gordan Gizdic: Like that theres a 12V input missing.
[2022-11-25T21:51:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I show u what i used
[2022-11-25T21:52:13] Gordan Gizdic: <photos/photo_6839@25-11-2022_21-52-13.jpg>
[2022-11-25T21:52:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I just changed cheapo to moped one what has separeted wires
[2022-11-25T21:52:31] Gordan Gizdic: I could change to that, but this should work.
[2022-11-25T21:52:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: All shit worked like magic
[2022-11-25T21:52:36] Gordan Gizdic: Something is missing.
[2022-11-25T21:53:47] Gordan Gizdic: I honestly think that fuckers forgot to add 12V input to the schematics.
[2022-11-25T21:53:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Show u what i mean
[2022-11-25T21:53:51] Gordan Gizdic: I do, i really do.

[2022-11-25T21:54:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Wiring off what i used and worked immidiatly
[2022-11-25T21:54:32] Gordan Gizdic: Yeah, thats mechanical, ofc that would work.
[2022-11-25T21:54:37] Gordan Gizdic: But!
[2022-11-25T21:54:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Problem is the same
[2022-11-25T21:54:59] Gordan Gizdic: I tested all the lights outside wiht a separate power supply. And they work.
[2022-11-25T21:55:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Sure they work
[2022-11-25T21:55:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Switch is joke catergory,that makes the problem
[2022-11-25T21:55:49] Gordan Gizdic: That could be it. But, im not giving up just yet.
[2022-11-25T21:55:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: When you individualy wire all swich it works

[2022-11-25T22:08:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Than position and wiring lenght ,than solder all needed wires Than test ,than add 704 pcb silocone on solderings and put whole adc modul into antistatic bag what you 704 silicone secure on body or battery, remove all unneeded wiring ,704 silicone all small plugs so they cant shake out ,also secure wiring nothing can move or jump and finaly i use to add silica gel pads ,what picks an moisture if it gets in
[2022-11-25T22:08:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: This second family and problems of it üòÅ

[2022-11-25T22:12:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: That's why better tighten and solder and secure that ,bolts killed us once,and they are not Secure ,stupid solution
[2022-11-25T22:13:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Atleast it would be push button type ,so it would hold
[2022-11-25T22:13:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Coz they are brainless idiots üòÖ
[2022-11-25T22:14:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also why it doesnt have a case or an option to bolt it
[2022-11-25T22:15:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: <animation>
[2022-11-25T22:15:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Wish this would be possible, to give feedbacks ü§£
[2022-11-25T22:16:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Just go cheapo and doesnt even think of ,coz they never used it
[2022-11-25T22:16:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I mean they tested on a table ,never build in
[2022-11-25T22:16:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Same as monorim
[2022-11-25T22:17:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Some day i wish if i would be Chinese
[2022-11-25T22:17:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Legs too long ,easy to solder on them
[2022-11-25T22:18:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Just use and antistatic bad bro ,like you get adc in
[2022-11-25T22:18:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Think over the wiring so you can put in it afterwards

[2022-11-25T22:20:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: This why you need to smart out the where and how
[2022-11-25T22:20:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I use to spend like days on that part
[2022-11-25T22:21:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Something is longer is easier to handle than if something is short
[2022-11-25T22:22:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But this comes from clothing for me ,but you should know this ,like If it's cold ,u have warm stuff what you wear or you have ina bag ,but if you have nothing and you are not dressed well ,you cant do nothing just freeze üòÖ
[2022-11-25T22:22:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I cant argue
[2022-11-25T22:25:29] Gordan Gizdic: Test them
[2022-11-25T22:25:34] Gordan Gizdic: Its not that hard.
[2022-11-25T22:25:45] Gordan Gizdic: Either you have continuity or dont.
[2022-11-25T22:26:54] Gordan Gizdic: Each button?
[2022-11-25T22:26:56] Gordan Gizdic: Cant be.
[2022-11-25T22:27:10] Gordan Gizdic: Ok, lets eliminate.
[2022-11-25T22:27:19] Gordan Gizdic: 2 of those must be + and -
[2022-11-25T22:27:30] Gordan Gizdic: So youre left with 3
[2022-11-25T22:27:47] Gordan Gizdic: What do the buttons do? Switch color when pressed?
[2022-11-25T22:28:00] Gordan Gizdic: What kind of a switch is it?
[2022-11-25T22:28:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well , I think it should be easy as i took a closer look ,one of it momentary as i see Doesnt look bad if it has enough long cabling
[2022-11-25T22:29:10] Gordan Gizdic: Do you have the switch close by?
[2022-11-25T22:29:16] Gordan Gizdic: Can you take a photo?
[2022-11-25T22:30:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Probably some for indicator lights on swich in each Rest switch
[2022-11-25T22:30:31] Gordan Gizdic: @Her0DasH, do you know rhe switching type of the input on the adc adapter?
[2022-11-25T22:30:54] Gordan Gizdic: Is it a simple shorted connection? Does it need specific voltage?
[2022-11-25T22:32:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Unsure what you mean
[2022-11-25T22:32:20] Gordan Gizdic: You said to said with tweezers?
[2022-11-25T22:32:35] Gordan Gizdic: So when you short the input than it turns on the lights?
[2022-11-25T22:32:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: With tweezers, i ment to use as the switch
[2022-11-25T22:32:56] Gordan Gizdic: You said to short the pins with tweezers. Im stupid, forgive me.
[2022-11-25T22:33:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yes
[2022-11-25T22:33:11] Gordan Gizdic: Yeah, than i know what the fuckers did.
[2022-11-25T22:33:16] Gordan Gizdic: Stupid motorn.
[2022-11-25T22:33:18] Gordan Gizdic: Morons
[2022-11-25T22:33:27] Gordan Gizdic: <photos/photo_6841@25-11-2022_22-33-27.jpg>
[2022-11-25T22:33:35] Gordan Gizdic: This is the pinout.
[2022-11-25T22:34:06] Gordan Gizdic: Ima talking about light cluster.
[2022-11-25T22:34:11] Gordan Gizdic: I figured it our.
[2022-11-25T22:34:13] Gordan Gizdic: Out.
[2022-11-25T22:34:38] Gordan Gizdic: Or at least im fairly certain. Ill test ofc.
[2022-11-25T22:34:41] Gordan Gizdic: But.
[2022-11-25T22:34:55] Gordan Gizdic: <photos/photo_6838@25-11-2022_21-51-02.jpg>
[2022-11-25T22:35:04] Gordan Gizdic: This is stupid/drunk and wrong.
[2022-11-25T22:35:17] Gordan Gizdic: If you take a look at the image before.
[2022-11-25T22:35:29] Gordan Gizdic: They supplied separate 12v input and ground.
[2022-11-25T22:35:48] Gordan Gizdic: Mutherfuckers did the wrong drawing on the schematics.
[2022-11-25T22:35:53] Gordan Gizdic: 12 goes to 12v
[2022-11-25T22:36:14] Gordan Gizdic: Each of the light, horn... Etc... Wires goes to input.
[2022-11-25T22:36:30] Gordan Gizdic: But ground needs to be connected to multiple points. Not 12V!
[2022-11-25T22:36:55] Gordan Gizdic: That way the cluster gets 12v for leds and the switches close to ground.
[2022-11-25T22:37:13] Gordan Gizdic: Im 99% sure they fucked it there
[2022-11-25T22:37:32] Gordan Gizdic: That would make sense and be logical.
[2022-11-25T22:37:41] Gordan Gizdic: Yup, gonna try it and test it.
[2022-11-25T22:38:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Try i dont remember if we tried that ,but probably
[2022-11-25T22:38:28] Gordan Gizdic: A couple of my friends have those switches and they work fine.
[2022-11-25T22:38:43] Gordan Gizdic: What tipped me off is that their leds are much much brighter.
[2022-11-25T22:39:04] Gordan Gizdic: Thats why i see 3.3v and not 12V
[2022-11-25T22:39:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I used a moped one at the end of the day ,better in usage and alu houseing
[2022-11-25T22:39:24] rosheee: <photos/photo_6843@25-11-2022_22-39-24.jpg>
[2022-11-25T22:39:26] Gordan Gizdic: Yeah, but i kinda really like this one.
[2022-11-25T22:39:39] Gordan Gizdic: I know, im stubborn. üòÇ
[2022-11-25T22:39:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I think its shitty in function
[2022-11-25T22:40:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Turn right push button,than indicator only goes off if you push same button againüòÖ
[2022-11-25T22:40:59] Gordan Gizdic: I dont mind. I wont be using it much but it looks nice.
[2022-11-25T22:41:06] Gordan Gizdic: So i can live with it. üòÇ
[2022-11-25T22:41:30] Gordan Gizdic: I know, think of it like its made in soviet era. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2022-11-25T22:42:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Wolf has it i think also ,some version of it atleast,but i dont like it only thing is few leds on whats kinda useless ,like no time to look down when you use it ,so i prefer function
[2022-11-25T22:42:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Wait i link you this i used

[2022-11-25T22:43:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Left one was it
[2022-11-25T22:43:34] Gordan Gizdic: That would work.
[2022-11-25T22:43:49] Gordan Gizdic: But, i have to order it and it takes a month to get to Croatia.
[2022-11-25T22:44:01] Gordan Gizdic: Than i have to do the wiring again.
[2022-11-25T22:44:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well it's winter bro
[2022-11-25T22:44:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also neighbor

[2022-11-25T22:44:42] Gordan Gizdic: Nah, cant do it. I wanna get it done.
[2022-11-25T22:44:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Do you use it in the winter?
[2022-11-25T22:44:53] Gordan Gizdic: Yup.
[2022-11-25T22:45:17] Gordan Gizdic: Limited though... To get to the shop and stuff like that. Time is a problem, parking also.
[2022-11-25T22:45:21] Gordan Gizdic: This solves it.
[2022-11-25T22:45:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Where do you live there ? Me Budapest, Hungary
[2022-11-25T22:45:35] Gordan Gizdic: Zagreb/Croatia.
[2022-11-25T22:45:46] Gordan Gizdic: Was to Balaton this summer.
[2022-11-25T22:45:56] Gordan Gizdic: Whats with the soviet era vibe there?
[2022-11-25T22:45:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Cool ,i was there like 5 times, neat city
[2022-11-25T22:46:05] Gordan Gizdic: Or is it just me? üòÇ
[2022-11-25T22:46:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Unsure what you mean under that
[2022-11-25T22:46:37] Gordan Gizdic: Its all grey.
[2022-11-25T22:46:42] Gordan Gizdic: Idk how to describe it.
[2022-11-25T22:46:49] Gordan Gizdic: Just the vibe o got. üòÅ
[2022-11-25T22:47:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: We buildings in the inner city what's way more older than soviet Era ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ

[2022-11-25T22:49:01] Gordan Gizdic: It must be me than. Still, was fun.
[2022-11-25T22:49:06] Gordan Gizdic: Kids liked it a lot.
[2022-11-25T22:49:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like Zagreb temple or castle are is old also
[2022-11-25T22:49:16] Gordan Gizdic: Might come back next year
[2022-11-25T22:49:41] Gordan Gizdic: Maybe i saw just a small part of it.
[2022-11-25T22:49:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Balaton is fun also depends on where you go and when
[2022-11-25T22:50:01] Gordan Gizdic: Northern part, cant remember the name of the place.
[2022-11-25T22:50:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: There is party weeks ,like you wont sleep for sure even if you live on the otherside üòÖ
[2022-11-25T22:50:23] Gordan Gizdic: Siofok

[2022-11-25T22:51:11] Gordan Gizdic: Yeah, south.. i looked it up now.
[2022-11-25T22:51:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I mean there
[2022-11-25T22:51:39] Gordan Gizdic: Going to garage to test this pos.
[2022-11-25T22:51:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: üëåüëç
[2022-11-25T22:51:58] Gordan Gizdic: My hands are cold. give me 10mins.
[2022-11-25T22:52:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Take your Time,dont rush and forget something
[2022-11-25T23:14:02] Gordan Gizdic: <video_file>
[2022-11-25T23:14:05] Gordan Gizdic: It has to be powered by 12V
[2022-11-25T23:14:11] Gordan Gizdic: Thats whats missing.
[2022-11-25T23:14:21] Gordan Gizdic: In their schematics theres no 12V input.
[2022-11-25T23:14:33] Gordan Gizdic: Im gonna investigate a bit more.
[2022-11-25T23:19:11] Gordan Gizdic: Ok, i fogured it out.
[2022-11-25T23:19:47] Gordan Gizdic: You have to supply 12V to orange wire and gnd to white wire.
[2022-11-25T23:20:02] Gordan Gizdic: Then it lights up and its functional.
[2022-11-25T23:20:23] Gordan Gizdic: When the led on the cluster is on, then it gives 12V to vesc input.
[2022-11-25T23:20:35] Gordan Gizdic: When the led is off, than it disconnects.
[2022-11-25T23:20:41] Gordan Gizdic: Thats how its working.
[2022-11-25T23:20:51] Gordan Gizdic: By providing 12v to output.
[2022-11-25T23:21:12] Gordan Gizdic: Now, as far as i know, vesc cant work with that input?
[2022-11-25T23:21:15] Gordan Gizdic: Or can it?
[2022-11-25T23:21:56] Gordan Gizdic: If it cant, than this has to have a relay after the output from the cluster thats NO.
[2022-11-25T23:22:03] Gordan Gizdic: If it can work, how?
[2022-11-25T23:22:16] Gordan Gizdic: Does it accept 12v input?
[2022-11-25T23:48:39] Gordan Gizdic: Yup, tested everything.
[2022-11-25T23:49:00] Gordan Gizdic: This cluster outputs 12 and thats it.
[2022-11-25T23:49:16] Gordan Gizdic: If the input accepts 12v trigger, than thats great.
[2022-11-25T23:49:27] Gordan Gizdic: If not, you have to put a NO relay.
[2022-11-25T23:49:44] Gordan Gizdic: NC relay. Srry
[2022-11-26T00:03:07] Gordan Gizdic: <photos/photo_6844@26-11-2022_00-03-07.jpg>
[2022-11-26T00:03:12] Gordan Gizdic: Only with relays.
[2022-11-26T00:03:40] Gordan Gizdic: Depending if you want leds on or off you choose NC or NO relays.
[2022-11-26T00:03:48] Gordan Gizdic: Thats it. Thats how you make it wprk.
[2022-11-26T00:04:00] Gordan Gizdic: 4 relays and the cluster works.
[2022-11-26T01:58:25] rosheee: ok @SibClimb
[2022-11-26T02:00:15] rosheee: I MET 2 old friends today and they gonna prepare me for next year fuckeria @ france normally here in switzerland we say when u gonna be fit and get fuckeria body "u gonna be a closet" but since they're both ex body builders and true closets they said "we gonna make u an aerodynamic ""desk/table""" !

[2022-11-26T15:54:07] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2022-11-26T15:55:23] Gordan Gizdic: Scoot?
[2022-11-26T15:55:44] Gordan Gizdic: I know, a lot of questions. üòÇ
[2022-11-26T15:56:42] Mirono escooters: Ebike
[2022-11-26T15:56:44] Mirono escooters: Dont worry lol
[2022-11-26T15:59:41] Gordan Gizdic: Ah.. nice.
[2022-11-26T15:59:41] Gordan Gizdic: Wifey wants an ebike.
[2022-11-26T15:59:41] Gordan Gizdic: Im considering still
[2022-11-26T15:59:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: Faster than @kawaiinekololis ‚Äòs ubox lol
[2022-11-26T16:00:02] Mirono escooters: His overheats, mine not
[2022-11-26T16:00:04] Mirono escooters: üòò
[2022-11-26T16:00:12] Mirono escooters: Its super
[2022-11-26T16:00:13] Mirono escooters: Do it
[2022-11-26T16:00:20] Mirono escooters: But diy not buy crap
[2022-11-26T16:01:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes because you set 60a batt
[2022-11-26T16:01:24] Gordan Gizdic: Yeah, diy always
[2022-11-26T16:01:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: If u same settings as him then your will be worse I think
[2022-11-26T16:02:47] Mirono escooters: Nah never
[2022-11-26T16:03:00] Mirono escooters: He cools through resin i directly to die.
[2022-11-26T16:03:18] Mirono escooters: Stupid sabvoton case bend but im not doing anything to it it works ans doesn't overheating
[2022-11-26T16:07:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes but your die smaller
[2022-11-26T16:07:14] Mirono escooters: Abit
[2022-11-26T16:07:25] Mirono escooters: As lonh as no overheating im good. :)

[2022-11-26T16:16:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: Why you have that much steel
[2022-11-26T17:29:35] Luis Magalhaes: Similar to mine?
[2022-11-26T17:38:31] Jan: Temp sensor broken, it not a realistic step response
[2022-11-26T17:38:45] Mirono escooters: How tf broken?
[2022-11-26T17:39:03] Mirono escooters: Its on the pcb, it heats up quick with 200a
[2022-11-26T17:39:24] Mirono escooters: I dont understand how it can be "broken" if works fine and reads normal C
[2022-11-26T17:39:33] Jan: The temp drop off would not happen that quickly and also not negative
[2022-11-26T17:39:40] Mirono escooters: Negative?
[2022-11-26T17:39:52] Mirono escooters: The cooling is quick, its direct die
[2022-11-26T17:40:04] Mirono escooters: How can it read badly? Magnetic interference?
[2022-11-26T17:40:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: Wrong beta coefficient
[2022-11-26T17:40:38] Jan: It jumps from 20 to 51 and stops and then gradually going down is not realistic for any system in my opinion
[2022-11-26T17:40:39] Mirono escooters: Wrong what?
[2022-11-26T17:41:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: At 25 degrees all type (10k) temp sensor are same
[2022-11-26T17:41:35] Mirono escooters: OwO
[2022-11-26T17:41:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: The resistance variation is different depends by beta coefficient
[2022-11-26T17:41:54] Mirono escooters: Then i try different firmware
[2022-11-26T17:42:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: Beta value *
[2022-11-26T17:45:31] Mirono escooters: Try diff fw now
[2022-11-26T17:46:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: Useless
[2022-11-26T17:46:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: You have to know beta value of the temp sensor
[2022-11-26T17:47:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: I'm not sure it's similar to yours
[2022-11-26T17:47:27] Mirono escooters: I try official fw versus the regular
[2022-11-26T17:47:56] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, you ask all the info you need, you tell me, and I'll tell you if I can get at better price for you ;)

[2022-11-26T17:48:12] Mirono escooters: Whateverthefuck?
[2022-11-26T17:49:56] Luis Magalhaes: Ok,mine i think its made from ly too 60H but smaller diameter then the new ones on wolf king
[2022-11-26T17:50:32] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes exactly
[2022-11-26T17:50:37] Luis Magalhaes: Don't know the kv of this too but im only able to do 100+- at 16S
[2022-11-26T17:50:48] Mirono escooters: 78v, its totally off. Where do i set it?
[2022-11-26T17:50:50] Face de Pin Suc√©: That is not bad üòÇ
[2022-11-26T17:51:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Same motor resistance between the 60v one and 72v one, the new one has less Kv.
[2022-11-26T17:52:02] Luis Magalhaes: Yes at 60v is not the lower kv i have seen, some laotis are doing like 85 at 16S and 11"
[2022-11-26T17:53:24] Luis Magalhaes: It looks like lower kv to me too but can't compare directly because they are at 20S and im at 16S
[2022-11-26T17:53:32] Luis Magalhaes: Should upgrade too üòÇ
[2022-11-26T17:53:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: I have both motor here
[2022-11-26T17:53:57] Face de Pin Suc√©: Just measure the max RPM at a certain voltage and we will know the KV you have
[2022-11-26T18:13:37] Luis Magalhaes: 2100rpm at 61v on kelly app, i measure this when it first start with kelly

[2022-11-26T18:21:25] Luis Magalhaes: 22x3 wolf warrior , 33x3 wolf king gt is this the winding? It's what it has written on the stator
[2022-11-26T18:22:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: 33x3 or 33x2 wolf king GT ?
[2022-11-26T18:22:45] Face de Pin Suc√©: 34KV
[2022-11-26T18:38:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: 30x4 they says, but I think is 22x4 , because same resistance as 22x3
[2022-11-26T19:01:58] Luis Magalhaes: A friend of mine says they wrote 33x3
[2022-11-26T19:04:34] Luis Magalhaes: Strange üòÖ
[2022-11-26T19:11:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: They do also 33x3
[2022-11-26T19:11:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: But the 2000w is 30x4
[2022-11-26T19:11:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: 1500 idk
[2022-11-26T19:12:48] Luis Magalhaes: Mine says 1200W from the warrior, the king is 1500w and the gt says 2000w
[2022-11-26T19:13:05] sombre_enfant: Wich model u got ?
[2022-11-26T19:13:14] Luis Magalhaes: 1200w
[2022-11-26T19:13:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: I‚Äôve both model, just never seen 1500w one
[2022-11-26T19:13:24] sombre_enfant: Wich scooter name ?
[2022-11-26T19:13:30] rosheee: My GT had 2000w
[2022-11-26T19:13:36] rosheee: Suc√©
[2022-11-26T19:13:52] sombre_enfant: Less suc√©
[2022-11-26T19:14:37] Luis Magalhaes: The one that has wrote inside 33x3 are the GT or he bought as the gt dont know üòÖ
[2022-11-26T19:14:49] Luis Magalhaes: Wolf warrior from kaabo
[2022-11-26T19:15:31] Luis Magalhaes: Not suce you didn't like it üòÇ
[2022-11-26T19:16:05] Luis Magalhaes: @roscheeee your suce is g30 fuckeria üòÇüòú
[2022-11-26T19:16:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: Gt impossible 33 parallel
[2022-11-26T19:16:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: Resistance is same as 22x3
[2022-11-26T19:17:27] Luis Magalhaes: Maybe he bought as GT and they send king 1500W üòÖ
[2022-11-26T19:17:57] Luis Magalhaes: But i think he mesure it, the gt is larger them 60h or not?
[2022-11-26T19:18:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Both are 60h
[2022-11-26T19:18:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: But idk winding
[2022-11-26T19:18:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: Maybe they used smaller copper
[2022-11-26T19:19:40] Luis Magalhaes: So GT just use larger case in motor?
[2022-11-26T19:19:58] Luis Magalhaes: I thought they where 65h üòÖ
[2022-11-26T19:20:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: They‚Äôve longer axle because they fit bigger wire
[2022-11-26T19:20:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: 5mm2 instead 4mm2
[2022-11-26T19:20:28] Luis Magalhaes: Oh my bad then üëå
[2022-11-26T19:20:56] Luis Magalhaes: Mine have 6mm ones and was a pain in the ass üòÇ
[2022-11-26T19:21:35] Luis Magalhaes: The weeped that has LY has what kv you know?
[2022-11-26T19:24:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: @SibClimb WEPED expert
[2022-11-26T19:28:05] Luis Magalhaes: But isn't this weeped motor same as the rion you had?

[2022-11-26T20:26:21] sombre_enfant: @Her0DasH Gordan is it worth to take the spintend adc for 10+?
[2022-11-26T20:27:03] Gordan Gizdic: It is to me. All get almost all the stock funcionality and remain "legal".
[2022-11-26T20:28:34] sombre_enfant: Checked to get one but shopping is as expensive as the product itselfüòë
[2022-11-26T20:29:27] Gordan Gizdic: Yup. I mean you can go without it if you dont need lights or you are going to have lights always on.
[2022-11-26T20:29:40] Gordan Gizdic: But for turn signals and stuff, you need it.
[2022-11-26T20:29:59] Gordan Gizdic: Also do you plan on having single/dual switch?

[2022-11-27T15:16:56] Artem Bulashev: Shunt mod on stock controller (+25% amps reading on BMS) resulted also in equally stronger Regen ebrake
[2022-11-27T15:17:07] Mirono escooters: Sounds logical
[2022-11-27T15:18:56] Artem Bulashev: Yeah just never thought about it. It‚Äôs good actually as it was too weak

[2022-11-27T18:20:25] rosheee: If less weight then maybe better
[2022-11-27T18:22:10] rosheee: Nope
[2022-11-27T18:22:51] rosheee: Bms says 40C max but then 20km hard push up down and mostly full throttle
[2022-11-27T18:23:05] rosheee: Anyone connected bms to vesc?
[2022-11-27T18:31:05] Luis Magalhaes: And what ambient temperature? üëÄ
[2022-11-27T18:32:31] rosheee: 15-20C idk

[2022-11-27T21:37:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Nice ,but pls secure adc ,to avoid shorts when you finalise position
[2022-11-27T21:37:35] Gordan Gizdic: I didnt, older kid did. üòÇ
[2022-11-27T21:37:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also what was solution to lights
[2022-11-27T21:38:04] Gordan Gizdic: Relays. 3 relays controller by light cluster. No othe way around it.
[2022-11-27T21:38:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Ohh ok ,he likes stickers
[2022-11-27T21:38:07] rosheee: idk i think temp. sensor on cells
[2022-11-27T21:38:24] Gordan Gizdic: She, both are girls. 10 and 4 y.o.

[2022-11-27T21:39:22] Gordan Gizdic: Also, no other way to make rear lights work. Commond ground is the issue.
[2022-11-27T21:39:40] Gordan Gizdic: Maybe after some time ill disassemble and rewire.
[2022-11-27T21:39:49] Gordan Gizdic: For now, i got all i need.
[2022-11-27T21:39:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Normaly I never use stickers like that ,like fuck magura Sent me nothing for free so i will not put a huge sticker on my shit with there name

[2022-11-27T21:41:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Show me or us when you have time
[2022-11-27T21:41:20] rosheee: no XD LOL just have 75V ubox
[2022-11-27T21:41:30] rosheee: if suc√© weather next weekend both 20S should be ready then a friend films us with drone lol
[2022-11-27T21:41:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But kinda Jesus fucking Christ
[2022-11-27T21:41:38] Gordan Gizdic: Relay cluster i made?
[2022-11-27T21:41:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yes whole
[2022-11-27T21:42:00] rosheee: XD not wanna fuck it also have no battery to test
[2022-11-27T21:42:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Its for the future ppl who suck with it
[2022-11-27T21:42:11] Gordan Gizdic: Ufff.. if i remember in the morning, i will.
[2022-11-27T21:42:24] Gordan Gizdic: They are small 2A relays... 2cm by 2cm.
[2022-11-27T21:42:40] Gordan Gizdic: Im taking 12V from the light cluster to turn them on/off.
[2022-11-27T21:42:48] Gordan Gizdic: Actualy really simple.
[2022-11-27T21:42:54] rosheee: 16S6P but crap idk why never over 90kmh maybe cuz battery maybe cuz new motors
[2022-11-27T21:43:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I get it
[2022-11-27T21:43:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Or i think,i do üòÅ
[2022-11-27T21:43:39] rosheee: can't deliver amps if take 300-350A phase battery current is nearly 1:1 with phase
[2022-11-27T21:43:53] rosheee: so he took battery voltage and then converted down to 12v?
[2022-11-27T21:44:32] rosheee: i'm not wanna test it üòÜneed spintend 16s as daily
[2022-11-27T21:44:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: No from the light
[2022-11-27T21:44:50] rosheee: from the 12v?
[2022-11-27T21:45:07] Gordan Gizdic: You take ground and use it as common, 12v wire goes to 12v, than you are left with signal wires from the cluster. Those wires go on to the relays. Thats how you short pins. By using NO relays. So for all functions you need 4 of them, im using only 3. Fuck horn. I can shout.
[2022-11-27T21:45:09] Gordan Gizdic: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2022-11-27T21:45:17] rosheee: XD
[2022-11-27T21:45:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But so annoying,like its a scam from them deeply
[2022-11-27T21:45:44] rosheee: put in delta mod then 50kmh with 10s
[2022-11-27T21:46:10] rosheee: or u can have the 16S6P üòÜchange bms to 80-120A ant
[2022-11-27T21:46:15] rosheee: buy from @Star_Delta_Master
[2022-11-27T21:46:25] Gordan Gizdic: Yup, and it is a scam. Theres no full info. That i call a scam.
[2022-11-27T21:47:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Not just ,not full info ,you needed to add stuff to make it work partly
[2022-11-27T21:47:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Atleast modul is working, i mean it could be worseüòÅ
[2022-11-27T21:48:38] Gordan Gizdic: Well, vsett is specific with the common ground so ill give them benefit of the doubt about that but for everything else, lets say i wont be trusting them anymore.
[2022-11-27T21:50:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: As i learnt from @SirGeoff never trust these ppl always measure out all
[2022-11-27T22:23:07] rosheee: without spacer would be best but then need 5P üòû
[2022-11-27T22:24:13] rosheee: samsung 50S maybe suc√© for 5P or 6P with ant bms on front or top for 16S6P i need 10mm spacer -_- cuz rear motor cables
[2022-11-27T22:39:16] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: man I want 50S so bad for my G30D project but hella expensive
[2022-11-27T22:39:29] rosheee: 50S XD?
[2022-11-27T22:39:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: no Samsung 50s
[2022-11-27T22:39:58] Mirono escooters: Expensive af
[2022-11-27T22:40:06] sombre_enfant: 40t
[2022-11-27T22:40:42] sombre_enfant: On dual u wont consume as much as your single
[2022-11-27T22:51:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: <animation>
[2022-11-27T22:58:00] Mirono escooters: And, what purpose?
[2022-11-27T22:58:08] Mirono escooters: Paolo being weird
[2022-11-27T22:58:21] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-11-27T22:59:43] Jan: Is it transitioning into meme? üòÖ
[2022-11-27T23:02:04] Mirono escooters: Only he is, so.. is it?
[2022-11-27T23:02:24] Mirono escooters: I have the slightest idea why he spams my gif xD
[2022-11-27T23:03:11] Mirono escooters: A hammer and luck? ;)
[2022-11-27T23:03:22] Mirono escooters: Best bet is finding a lokal makerspace to bend it tbh
[2022-11-27T23:42:39] Mirko Boni: good evening to all my G30 seems to have some battery problem, I have a 16S 5P battery with sony Vtc6A cells and a bms smart Ant. I ask you a question, if you charge the battery, after 2 days the voltage you find is the same? I charged the scooter on Friday night at 67.2, this afternoon it was at 66.5. Do you think this is normal? Then I thought it might be the Bluetooth of the bms smart always on, I put it in freeze mode after 180 sec and put the battery back on charge! After an hour the battery dropped from 67.2 to 67.1
[2022-11-27T23:44:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs pretty normal
[2022-11-27T23:44:23] Mirono escooters: Cells can "settle" but usually with new batteries, its little
[2022-11-27T23:44:39] Mirono escooters: It sounds good enough tho
[2022-11-27T23:44:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: Battery cell always goes down from 4.2 at 4.15 per charge after charging
[2022-11-27T23:45:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because the voltage is no stabilized, if you want stabilized need to put in CV for at least 2 days
[2022-11-27T23:45:29] Mirko Boni: So Paul, should it stop?
[2022-11-27T23:45:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: Should be goes down slower at 66.4v
[2022-11-27T23:46:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: But even Bluetooth of ant use much battery
[2022-11-27T23:46:20] Mirono escooters: Much?? üòÇüòÇ
[2022-11-27T23:46:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Sorry I‚Äôm wrong
[2022-11-27T23:46:29] Mirko Boni: what does CV mean?
[2022-11-27T23:46:38] Mirono escooters: Constant voltage
[2022-11-27T23:46:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: I mean stanby mode of vesc
[2022-11-27T23:46:44] Mirono escooters: Aha
[2022-11-27T23:46:56] Mirono escooters: Thats why i use breaker now i noticed that too
[2022-11-27T23:47:22] Mirko Boni: bluetooth is off now
[2022-11-27T23:49:08] Mirko Boni: @Mirono_escooters @PaoloWu But if I use the throttle with the off key, does that disconnect the voltage to the vesc?
[2022-11-27T23:49:19] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-11-27T23:49:30] Mirono escooters: If you mean vesc with onoff function
[2022-11-27T23:50:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt know where is connected to the key on ubox
[2022-11-27T23:50:55] Mirko Boni: I use ubox 75 v2 with throttle and key off
[2022-11-27T23:51:31] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_6862@27-11-2022_23-51-31.jpg>
[2022-11-27T23:52:01] Mirko Boni: @PaoloWu questo sistema
[2022-11-27T23:53:49] Mirko Boni: thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2022-11-27T23:58:24] Mirko Boni: @Mirono_escooters In your opinion, is it better to keep the bluetooth of the bms smart always on mode?
[2022-11-28T00:01:14] Mirono escooters: Always on i do
[2022-11-28T00:04:11] Mirko Boni: i get it now, thank you
[2022-11-28T00:26:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Depends on lot things,near your build
[2022-11-28T00:32:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: From bms side, guys told the best
[2022-11-28T00:44:39] Mirko Boni: thank you
[2022-11-28T01:33:46] Rogerio Figueiredo: Does the v√™s support key?
[2022-11-28T01:36:24] Mirko Boni: yes yes absolutely! i have been using it for 2 months now
[2022-11-28T01:36:51] Rogerio Figueiredo: And works fine
[2022-11-28T02:02:42] Mirko Boni: yes yes very well
[2022-11-28T07:23:00] rosheee: Eheheh i found out why have cuts and lower speed
[2022-11-28T07:23:13] rosheee: Daly bms autocut at 2.7V cell voltage..ehheh
[2022-11-28T07:25:26] rosheee: I set vesc ti cutoff start at 2.65V XD and end 2.6V
[2022-11-28T07:25:46] rosheee: Now changed and wh00p 10kw 95kmh life back
[2022-11-28T09:46:21] Artem Bulashev: Your brake is rubbing like crazy fyi :) some people seem to be able to ignore it so much so that they don‚Äôt realize Great job though on 12v
[2022-11-28T10:03:15] Gordan Gizdic: Nah, i know what it is. It just takes a second with a dremel tool. Brake disc has imperfection on 2 spots, 0.1mm in width and its rubbing ever so slightly. Ill fix it when im done with vesc. It annoys me also but focus is on wiring since im not driving it. üòÅ
[2022-11-28T10:59:20] Artem Bulashev: Ok good because some people some how do not hear it / realize it is not supposed to do that sound üòÑ
[2022-11-28T11:46:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Sry felt a sleep, on of my scooters i have shunt mode ,it measures amps etc That eats even it's turned off, do you have anything similar?
[2022-11-28T11:49:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You just change it to key from button , but he has spintend Also i dont really see ,but i am Guessing it doesnt show Correct voltgate also
[2022-11-28T11:52:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I hate it also, but his in the Middle of wiring, so i didn't mention but noticed üòÖ
[2022-11-28T11:59:52] Rogerio Figueiredo: Never seen a way of turning off a vesc
[2022-11-28T12:00:03] Rogerio Figueiredo: That is why I ask
[2022-11-28T12:00:14] Rogerio Figueiredo: I thought u have allways to remove the battery
[2022-11-28T12:00:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Let me laugh
[2022-11-28T12:01:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So once again here we are
[2022-11-28T12:03:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: However i tell ppl to buy antispark swich modul ,no we dont Its for that,to be able to swich on off vesc And still spintend has this build in Flipsky doesnt Makersbase doesnt
[2022-11-28T12:03:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So no wonder you cant turn off
[2022-11-28T12:04:02] Gordan Gizdic: <photos/photo_6863@28-11-2022_12-04-02.jpg>
[2022-11-28T12:04:18] Gordan Gizdic: Look what i got for a test.
[2022-11-28T12:04:25] Gordan Gizdic: Let the trolling commence.
[2022-11-28T12:04:28] Gordan Gizdic: PS
[2022-11-28T12:04:38] Gordan Gizdic: Its awfull and terrible. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2022-11-28T12:05:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I Always have confusing feeling that we are the only who builds for Customers, Like how you give it to them Sry on off ,you spent x $$$ but no turn off Other joke here you have xt90 key
[2022-11-28T12:05:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also with xiaomi screen mod you turn screen off ,vesc stays on
[2022-11-28T12:06:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: Just use a as150
[2022-11-28T12:06:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: ?
[2022-11-28T12:06:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Still same
[2022-11-28T12:07:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I will not give a plug to customer,here is your key
[2022-11-28T12:07:20] Gordan Gizdic: Heavy, unresponsive, no hall so it wants to go backwards, feels like a truck.
[2022-11-28T12:08:07] Gordan Gizdic: Also, just a tiny bit of throttle input, it jolts like a rocker for 0.5s that throttles back.
[2022-11-28T12:08:16] Gordan Gizdic: Finesse? Non existant.
[2022-11-28T12:08:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well for sec ahe doesnt know direction,but you Should not feel that
[2022-11-28T12:08:32] Gordan Gizdic: But you do, yes you do.
[2022-11-28T12:08:34] Gordan Gizdic: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2022-11-28T12:09:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Not sure what you mean coz strange words you use
[2022-11-28T12:09:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But should able to set throttle also
[2022-11-28T12:11:12] Gordan Gizdic: English is not my native language so sorry
[2022-11-28T12:11:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Same from here
[2022-11-28T12:11:33] Gordan Gizdic: When you are driving slow... Like in the range of 10-20kmh.
[2022-11-28T12:11:59] Gordan Gizdic: And you apply throttle input, but just a little bit, to lets say accelerate from 12kmh to 18kmh.
[2022-11-28T12:12:20] Gordan Gizdic: It pulls hard for 0.5s, than it lets go.
[2022-11-28T12:12:25] Gordan Gizdic: Like it has epilepsy.
[2022-11-28T12:12:42] Gordan Gizdic: Theres no smoothness in throttle control at all, not even a little.
[2022-11-28T12:13:19] Gordan Gizdic: Its like you are trying to apply throttle with a hammer.
[2022-11-28T12:13:21] Gordan Gizdic: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2022-11-28T12:13:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What throttle you have?
[2022-11-28T12:13:41] Gordan Gizdic: Finger. Stock one on vsett 11 super 72.
[2022-11-28T12:15:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I have no idea which type is that, point finger type? If yes i dont use any like that
[2022-11-28T12:15:52] Gordan Gizdic: Point finger, yes.
[2022-11-28T12:16:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well usually all works shitty to be honest
[2022-11-28T12:16:36] Gordan Gizdic: Also, when it does that to the trottle, epilepsy mode as i call it, scoot rushes and it makes you pull on the throttle just a bit more. Making it worse. üòÇ
[2022-11-28T12:16:46] Gordan Gizdic: Lets just say im terrified of it.
[2022-11-28T12:16:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yeah most unsafe throttle you can have
[2022-11-28T12:17:05] Gordan Gizdic: Not because if the power but because the inputs and response are that terrible.
[2022-11-28T12:17:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I would say change it
[2022-11-28T12:17:35] Gordan Gizdic: Like driving a truck with hyper sensitive rocket engine.
[2022-11-28T12:17:53] Gordan Gizdic: I cant, i took it for a test for a couple of weeks.
[2022-11-28T12:17:57] Gordan Gizdic: Its not mine.
[2022-11-28T12:18:27] Gordan Gizdic: Im building my vsett 10, this is a vsett 11, super 72 that i took for a test.
[2022-11-28T12:19:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Sometimes we use to rewireü§î Not the best word, I mean we add xiaomi type throttle so it will be thumb throttle but still keeps screen Imagine on stock mantis or any Sensor better in that
[2022-11-28T12:19:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Ohh
[2022-11-28T12:19:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: That's normal
[2022-11-28T12:19:33] Gordan Gizdic: Again, i cant. Its a demo vehicle. Must not touch anything on 11 super 72.
[2022-11-28T12:19:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: All point finger is crap
[2022-11-28T12:19:57] Gordan Gizdic: Amen, i agree.
[2022-11-28T12:20:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Probably near that its shit bldc
[2022-11-28T12:20:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Fun when you buy a crap like that üôà
[2022-11-28T12:21:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Ment to be shitü§£
[2022-11-28T12:22:35] Gordan Gizdic: I expected a bit of smoothness, i mean its a 72V super 72, top model after all.
[2022-11-28T12:22:52] Gordan Gizdic: But nope, crap. Undrivable on sidewalks and slow speeds.
[2022-11-28T12:23:08] Gordan Gizdic: Meant to go full throttle, im scared, straight line speeds.
[2022-11-28T12:23:11] Gordan Gizdic: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2022-11-28T12:23:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Even this super 72 is stolen name bro
[2022-11-28T12:23:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: From the ebike
[2022-11-28T12:23:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Super 73

[2022-11-29T02:12:49] Unknown: I bought some of this for the vape batteries of my wife.. they're funny...

[2022-11-29T02:28:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I am unsure how it would perform with me ,i think my attitude would destroy heat lines and fuck it up, also it could be nice I usually dress up to weather, i use to being Outside all day when its 40 and when its -10 If you plan to be outside a lot ,u need to dress up good, than things change. Like even if i dont have helly hansen on My work pants and its top is x% water and windproof also, so even does do the job when its not that cold
[2022-11-29T02:30:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Usually when everything is ice i dont scoot If there is fresh snow i surly go Out and also like early winter forest paths with 30 cm high wet leaves ü§£

[2022-11-29T08:00:28] Jan: I assume the place where the controller is, is so far away from any radiator that you decided to make a waterloop?
[2022-11-29T08:01:10] Mirono escooters: Not me
[2022-11-29T08:01:24] Mirono escooters: But yeap
[2022-11-29T08:01:28] Mirono escooters: Fb guy
[2022-11-29T08:03:42] S1m 0n: Saw something similar yesterday üòÑü§ò
[2022-11-29T08:09:15] Jan: The question is also how much tdp heat in watts do you need to remove from the controller that it is worth it to go for watercooling
[2022-11-29T08:09:58] Jan: Im fine with direct air cooling at 20kW not getting above 45deg
[2022-11-29T08:10:14] Jan: Any other thing gets hotter ü§∑
[2022-11-29T08:10:36] Jan: M365 with water loop sounds a bit questionable to me tbh
[2022-11-29T08:10:43] Jan: The frame is so tiny
[2022-11-29T08:10:55] Jan: <sticker>
[2022-11-29T08:24:21] Mirono escooters: Its that post ;)
[2022-11-29T08:24:47] Mirono escooters: Worth for me is Boat. Obviously When u need silence
[2022-11-29T08:25:38] Mirono escooters: And powerful machines xD
[2022-11-29T08:25:46] Jan: Yeah boat makes sense as it is open loop
[2022-11-29T08:25:51] Mirono escooters: Hey cant hurt to try
[2022-11-29T08:25:57] Jan: You dont need a radiator
[2022-11-29T08:26:08] Jan: True
[2022-11-29T08:26:09] Mirono escooters: I mean, looad of wotter Boat motors tiny for their power
[2022-11-29T10:51:09] Artem Bulashev: I would recommend heat pipes as they works passively and extremely well
[2022-11-29T11:44:50] Gordan Gizdic: Im stoopid. Need halp.
[2022-11-29T11:44:55] Gordan Gizdic: <photos/photo_6883@29-11-2022_11-44-55.jpg>
[2022-11-29T11:45:19] Gordan Gizdic: These values from real time monitoring, arr they per motor or both combined?
[2022-11-29T11:51:02] S1m 0n: I think I would also rely on an air cooling solution. easy to implement. Value for money 10/10
[2022-11-29T11:54:02] S1m 0n: water cooling, would bring one block per fet. I don't know if water cooling is really that much more efficient if you cool the entire controller block?
[2022-11-29T11:54:42] S1m 0n: head pips would certainly be interesting, but also a lot of work
[2022-11-29T11:55:24] S1m 0n: the next one will probably come with liquid nitrogen as cooling üòÑ
[2022-11-29T11:59:19] Mirono escooters: https://a.aliexpress.com/_mOQ4qNm
[2022-11-29T11:59:21] Mirono escooters: Whattefak
[2022-11-29T11:59:42] Mirono escooters: And no water and pump and shit
[2022-11-29T11:59:46] Jan: Heatpipes are really really powerful in transfering heat away, but they have a power limit where they fail. If you need to transfer more heat than that powerlimit, you would need water
[2022-11-29T11:59:47] Mirono escooters: Less moving parts. Less to fail
[2022-11-29T12:00:30] Jan: As water and heatpipes, both are for heat-transfer, they are not the radiator
[2022-11-29T12:29:32] Gordan Gizdic: <photos/photo_6884@29-11-2022_12-29-32.jpg>
[2022-11-29T12:29:44] Gordan Gizdic: 10mm2. Will be enough, i guess? üòÇ
[2022-11-29T12:41:31] Gordan Gizdic: Im connecting external pack. 80A continuous. Got to have a nice thick wire. 80A is no joke.
[2022-11-29T12:42:57] Mirono escooters: Indeed
[2022-11-29T12:51:29] Gordan Gizdic: Once more. These values are per side or together? Ubox is connected with can so im guessing total valus for both.
[2022-11-29T13:35:53] Mirono escooters: Together
[2022-11-29T13:43:08] Gordan Gizdic: Thnx. So i got up to 1.6k today and it was nice. Felt smooth, controllable and awesome. So far not oushing anything untill i connect my second pack.
[2022-11-29T13:43:50] Gordan Gizdic: Phase current was set to 80A and pack current to 60A. Had nice grunt but i did not push anything on a small parking lot.
[2022-11-29T13:44:31] Gordan Gizdic: Took it up to maybe 35kmh.
[2022-11-29T13:44:36] Gordan Gizdic: Yup.
[2022-11-29T13:45:05] Gordan Gizdic: Actuall, wanted less, forgot to lower from the test i did before when it was suspended in air.
[2022-11-29T13:49:02] Gordan Gizdic: I connected the BT module to the dedicated port and that port is actually on rear esc.
[2022-11-29T13:49:09] Gordan Gizdic: So good here.
[2022-11-29T13:49:23] Gordan Gizdic: Also, i made some profiles with speed limitations.
[2022-11-29T13:49:31] Gordan Gizdic: But it goes faster than that.
[2022-11-29T13:49:37] Gordan Gizdic: And help with that?
[2022-11-29T13:49:41] Gordan Gizdic: Legal reasons.
[2022-11-29T14:11:09] rosheee: only for possis
[2022-11-29T14:11:44] rosheee: dude 10kw life
[2022-11-29T14:15:29] Gordan Gizdic: Easy. Easy there horsey. ü§£ü§£
[2022-11-29T14:16:00] Gordan Gizdic: Ah, could be that the profiles are not set to both vescs... Yup, forgot about that. Thnx mate.
[2022-11-29T14:36:43] Gordan Gizdic: Nah, it is for sure.
[2022-11-29T14:37:04] Gordan Gizdic: I forgot to switch escs when applying profiles.
[2022-11-29T14:37:12] Gordan Gizdic: My mistake, too much on my mind
[2022-11-29T15:04:24] Unknown: A nice warm one üëå 20km lol try 65-150km.

[2022-11-29T23:18:59] Mirono escooters: Me too when i arrive at school i need to remember to turn em off

[2022-11-29T23:21:31] Mirono escooters: Since i drive offroad daily i need to see potholes in advance
[2022-11-29T23:22:49] Artem Bulashev: Yeah mine is triple. One will be up close + one above as upper low beam with sharp shadow And 3rd will be high beam with no sharp shadow, for off-road on no cars
[2022-11-29T23:23:12] Mirono escooters: OwO i got beaten

[2022-11-30T14:20:06] Artem Bulashev: Neh, would not over heat battery pack before connector disintegrated and lost the short (usually welding on the connector melts and falls off)
[2022-11-30T14:21:14] Gordan Gizdic: I know that but my 10 y.o. kid doesnt. Add smoke, add flash... She wasnt happy at all.
[2022-11-30T15:59:47] Artem Bulashev: Which lamp?
[2022-11-30T16:01:40] Mirono escooters: L√§mp
[2022-11-30T16:02:02] Mirono escooters: <animation>
[2022-11-30T16:42:00] B√≥br Kurwa: The motors are excellent, only they are assembled terribly. The stator is wound with a different number of turns. somewhere 4, somewhere 3.
[2022-11-30T16:42:20] Mirono escooters: What. How
[2022-11-30T16:43:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs the seller fault
[2022-11-30T16:43:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: never saw that x)
[2022-11-30T16:44:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: Different Kv
[2022-11-30T16:44:18] Mirono escooters: Efficienty go brr
[2022-11-30T16:45:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: .
[2022-11-30T16:47:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Mine compared in price what was linked
[2022-11-30T16:47:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: The seller choose what type of winding to buy
[2022-11-30T16:48:35] B√≥br Kurwa: for rewinding the most it. I plugged in 24 wires of 4 turns
[2022-11-30T16:48:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: Less turn = more speed, obviously they put more parallel
[2022-11-30T16:49:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: That mean more current supported
[2022-11-30T16:50:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: Whut
[2022-11-30T16:50:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think he mean dome motor comes with different turns winding
[2022-11-30T16:56:01] Mirono escooters: I think he means that
[2022-11-30T16:56:23] B√≥br Kurwa: Yes..
[2022-11-30T16:57:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: So that‚Äôs normal
[2022-11-30T17:25:11] Artem Bulashev: If I ever will re windy motor will be using this
[2022-11-30T17:25:29] rosheee: Lol
[2022-11-30T17:25:35] rosheee: Fakce tunis ahahaha

[2022-11-30T17:25:54] rosheee: 8 guys vs 1 naked boi
[2022-11-30T17:39:52] Mirono escooters: Thats cool
[2022-11-30T17:44:13] Artem Bulashev: Some people use square silver
[2022-11-30T17:44:32] Artem Bulashev: To gain 2.5 Efficency gain
[2022-11-30T17:45:39] Artem Bulashev: But motor that is 90% efficient and capable of 1000w will do over 1800w if it‚Äôs effiebcy increased by 2.5%
[2022-11-30T17:46:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ps. Don‚Äôt exist free energy
[2022-11-30T17:46:46] Artem Bulashev: Also square wire is known to kill skin effect
[2022-11-30T17:46:58] Jan: 90% eff and 1000W overall energy input is 100W heat and 900W kinetic energy
[2022-11-30T17:47:30] Jan: 92.5% eff and 1000W overall will be 75W heat and 925W kinetic energy
[2022-11-30T17:48:16] Jan: Skin effect is part of the conductor area and not shape right?
[2022-11-30T17:48:49] Jan: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect
[2022-11-30T17:49:13] Artem Bulashev: Yeah read about high power transformers
[2022-11-30T17:49:22] Artem Bulashev: They use square winding for that property
[2022-11-30T17:49:42] Artem Bulashev: Don‚Äôt know much more than that as to why it is less on square wire core
[2022-11-30T17:50:48] Artem Bulashev: Considering we are trying to got for higher kHz for small motors to be more Efficient it may be beneficial I figure
[2022-11-30T17:52:30] Jan: Hmm i think many small enameled wires will do more than a square shape for efficiency
[2022-11-30T17:52:39] Artem Bulashev: Sort yes. I calculated it from 95% to 97.5% just for random example = 1k watt to 2k watt
[2022-11-30T17:53:01] Artem Bulashev: But they will luck heat transfer
[2022-11-30T17:53:50] Jan: Square could be higher package density but i think its neglectable small
[2022-11-30T17:53:52] Artem Bulashev: Never saw any one do that winding. Makes me wonder
[2022-11-30T17:54:16] Artem Bulashev: Well easy ebough to draw it / simulate
[2022-11-30T17:54:32] Jan: The stator is a 3phase ac current right?
[2022-11-30T17:54:42] Artem Bulashev: Silver being 10% more conductive could do a lot in theory
[2022-11-30T17:54:47] Artem Bulashev: Yes
[2022-11-30T17:54:53] Mirono escooters: Silver?? The price must be absurd
[2022-11-30T17:54:58] Artem Bulashev: Alternating current with about 16khz
[2022-11-30T17:55:07] Jan: The frequency depends on the rpm of the rotor right?
[2022-11-30T17:55:07] Artem Bulashev: 100‚Ç¨ per motor in material
[2022-11-30T17:55:18] Mirono escooters: Jezos
[2022-11-30T17:55:20] Artem Bulashev: Controller setting I mean
[2022-11-30T17:55:28] Mirono escooters: Why no motor manufacturer use square wire?
[2022-11-30T17:55:29] Jan: 16khz is only the mosfet on/off signal but not the sinewave it self
[2022-11-30T17:55:30] Artem Bulashev: Not sure if it changes with rpm
[2022-11-30T17:55:32] Mirono escooters: Tesla? For e cars?
[2022-11-30T17:56:07] Jan: The sinewave current introduces the EM field
[2022-11-30T17:56:07] Artem Bulashev: Above my pay grade
[2022-11-30T17:56:35] Artem Bulashev: Only casually researching it for now
[2022-11-30T17:56:37] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-11-30T17:56:39] Jan: 16kHZ is in my understanding the mosfet speed as it can only switch on or off and has to produce a sinewave
[2022-11-30T17:56:39] Artem Bulashev: But intersting topic
[2022-11-30T17:56:56] Artem Bulashev: That‚Äôs my understanding
[2022-11-30T17:57:16] Jan: But the sinewave itself must travel in the stator as fast as the rotor
[2022-11-30T17:57:33] Jan: Die EM field interacts with the rotor magnets
[2022-11-30T17:57:39] Artem Bulashev: No
[2022-11-30T17:57:49] Artem Bulashev: Control loop can be a lot faster
[2022-11-30T17:58:11] Artem Bulashev: Actually not sure
[2022-11-30T17:58:27] Artem Bulashev: Never saw sine wave frequency in relation to motor
[2022-11-30T17:58:29] Artem Bulashev: Sorry
[2022-11-30T17:58:46] Mirono escooters: I will test that at school :)
[2022-11-30T17:58:47] Artem Bulashev: There are 2 frequency loops in controllers
[2022-11-30T17:59:32] Mirono escooters: Frequency shouldnt change, since a ac motor on mains voltage is fixed 50hz :)
[2022-11-30T17:59:45] Mirono escooters: But that is not smart controlled, and the most basic thing ever. So.
[2022-11-30T18:00:09] Mirono escooters: And with the current before 90*
[2022-11-30T18:00:14] Mirono escooters: I cant translate it well
[2022-11-30T18:01:20] Mirono escooters: It still need to match with magnets, so it shouldn't change either, but theoretically it could. But i see no point
[2022-11-30T18:01:30] Mirono escooters: With my basic understanding xD
[2022-11-30T18:02:25] Mirono escooters: Since a 60Hz voltage supply switches polarity 20% faster than a 50Hz supply, a motor rated for 50Hz will spin at 20% higher rpm. Motor torque stays relatively constant, and a higher speed results in a higher shaft power
[2022-11-30T18:02:36] Jan: Each stator section gets turned on and off in the right moment, and then it looks like the EM field is traveling along the rotor magnets
[2022-11-30T18:02:46] Mirono escooters: Yes you are correct
[2022-11-30T18:02:59] Mirono escooters: The frequency cant and isnt changed
[2022-11-30T18:03:17] Jan: Im not sure about the frequency
[2022-11-30T18:03:34] Jan: For me sounds like frequency = rpm
[2022-11-30T18:03:55] Jan: Im no electrical engineer ü§∑
[2022-11-30T18:04:27] Jan: A wall socket is not 3phase
[2022-11-30T18:05:19] Jan: Yes
[2022-11-30T18:06:28] Mirono escooters: I talk 3 phase motors
[2022-11-30T18:06:41] Mirono escooters: From machinery yk
[2022-11-30T18:06:42] Jan: If we talk about the same, one is mosfet switch frequency and one is the frequency generated to control motor rpm
[2022-11-30T18:07:10] Jan: Constant frequency should result in constant speed right?
[2022-11-30T18:07:22] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-11-30T18:07:28] Mirono escooters: Those are prefixed speed
[2022-11-30T18:08:58] Mirono escooters: But very basic only a capacitor and it turns xD Idk how much we can compare them
[2022-11-30T18:09:01] Mirono escooters: But principle same
[2022-11-30T18:49:18] Artem Bulashev: More like constant acceleration?
[2022-11-30T18:49:42] Mirono escooters: Yesnt
[2022-11-30T18:49:43] Artem Bulashev: Also there is vectors in play determining acceleration and I guess speed.
[2022-11-30T18:50:18] Artem Bulashev: Than it doesn‚Äôt change with RPM
[2022-11-30T18:50:21] Mirono escooters: Your current/voltage sinewave is shifted according to capacitor, aka 90*. So yes, acceleration will be constant since fixed current
[2022-11-30T18:50:46] Artem Bulashev: Voltage on motor is not constant
[2022-11-30T18:51:01] Mirono escooters: It is with a simple 3 phase motor we were talking :)
[2022-11-30T18:51:03] Artem Bulashev: It is increasing from 0 to nearly battery voltage at full air speed
[2022-11-30T18:51:09] Mirono escooters: I know
[2022-11-30T18:51:24] Mirono escooters: On vesc i have little idea. More magic happening
[2022-11-30T18:51:51] Mirono escooters: There will still be a correlation, but wich, i dont think is defined simply like a normal motor
[2022-11-30T18:53:06] Mirono escooters: Although. If you shift your phase At example 5v more phase current availble, it should be pretty linear yea since it compensates
[2022-11-30T18:53:10] Mirono escooters: Hard to explain xD
[2022-11-30T19:00:39] Artem Bulashev: In the early days of VFDs, PWM was successfully used to control motors at less than 10 times the frequency of the synthesized sine wave. At that frequency, motor losses were increased a little, but careful selection of motor ratings to suit the duty compensated for that. The acoustical noise made by the motors was ok for factory environments. PWM at 30 or 40 times motor frequency is sufficient to reduce motor losses to an almost insignificant increase above pure sine wave losses. Offering a customer adjustment in the range of 30 X to 300 X provides the opportunity to find an operating point at which acoustical noise is not a problem. Operating in the upper end of that range may come at the cost of reduced VFD efficiency and the need to upsize the VFD for a given motor.
[2022-11-30T19:01:29] Artem Bulashev: Doesn‚Äôt answer what motor sine wave frequency depend on, but still interesting read on the proportion
[2022-11-30T19:02:29] Mirono escooters: Learning is good
[2022-11-30T19:03:10] Mirono escooters: Paolo go brr
[2022-11-30T19:03:28] Artem Bulashev: Looks like FW of the controller determines what frequency of sine wave it will be
[2022-11-30T19:04:44] Mirono escooters: What would vesc one be?
[2022-11-30T19:04:54] Artem Bulashev: No idea
[2022-11-30T19:05:27] Artem Bulashev: Hahah
[2022-11-30T19:05:28] Artem Bulashev: Man
[2022-11-30T19:05:31] Artem Bulashev: Easy
[2022-11-30T19:05:48] Mirono escooters: When i have mp2 i take to school and do measurements
[2022-11-30T19:05:50] Artem Bulashev: if I want to have 20000RPM (for example) I'd need a sine-wave of (20000RPM*5pole-pairs) / 60seconds = 1.666 kHz
[2022-11-30T19:05:52] Mirono escooters: Need todo anyway
[2022-11-30T19:07:53] Mirono escooters: But going of that logic, ,we can just get more speed with more khz
[2022-11-30T19:08:05] Artem Bulashev: True FOC requires exact knowledge of the position of the rotor, hall sensors is not enough since the position is known only six times per electric revolution. Most controllers that call themselves FOC are actually a simulated sinewave so the output is sine shaped but the field oriented control is not done. An example of true FOC is the VESC where there is a sensorless position algorithm that‚Äôs accurate enough and a processor powerful enough to do FOC (if parameters are set correctly )
[2022-11-30T19:08:08] Artem Bulashev: ü´£
[2022-11-30T19:08:29] Mirono escooters: Vesc go brr
[2022-11-30T19:08:36] Artem Bulashev: So senseless can be true foc but hall sensored is simulated FOC
[2022-11-30T19:08:46] Mirono escooters: Sounds logical
[2022-11-30T19:08:56] Mirono escooters: Vesc true magic autodetecting it all
[2022-11-30T19:09:41] Mirono escooters: With some tries I learned when i do motor detection, and i. The beginning yk it spins it and does BRR sound? If it doesnt spin at beginning. I get 300A rating If it does spin in beginning and then sound, rating fine and motor works perfectly
[2022-11-30T19:09:52] Mirono escooters: (look idk, must be a bug but it works)

[2022-12-01T00:46:10] Gordan Gizdic: <files/Screen Recording (1.12.2022. 0-39-45).wmv>
[2022-12-01T00:47:52] Gordan Gizdic: I designed a cover for ubox v2. Basically its a cover that goes over the stock cooling fins and it also houses the stock ubox 50mm fan.
[2022-12-01T00:48:22] Gordan Gizdic: Idea is to cover the cooling fins when you mount your ubox to the bottom plate of you scoot.
[2022-12-01T00:48:38] Gordan Gizdic: Fml. Ill recode.
[2022-12-01T00:48:41] Gordan Gizdic: Gimme a min.
[2022-12-01T00:52:00] Gordan Gizdic: Stupid recording but hey, at least you can see what it is.
[2022-12-01T00:52:09] Gordan Gizdic: <video_file>
[2022-12-01T00:52:40] Gordan Gizdic: Its meant to be printed, it goes over the aluminium cooler for ubox v2 and it has a mounting point for stock 50mm fan inside.
[2022-12-01T00:52:47] Gordan Gizdic: Yup.
[2022-12-01T00:52:51] Gordan Gizdic: Exactly.
[2022-12-01T00:53:03] Gordan Gizdic: To protect from dust and debris.
[2022-12-01T00:53:30] Gordan Gizdic: It is, thats why i left the front a rear openings.
[2022-12-01T00:53:39] Gordan Gizdic: Those use airflow as you ride.
[2022-12-01T00:54:01] Gordan Gizdic: But when you stop or you are pushing it up the hill, than the fan will help.
[2022-12-01T00:54:25] Gordan Gizdic: Set it to extract air outwards and to turn on at 50 degrees and you are golden.
[2022-12-01T00:54:57] Gordan Gizdic: Also, ill use something over the openings to protect from leaves and dust. I just have to see what will work best.
[2022-12-01T00:55:07] Gordan Gizdic: This way you got best of both worlds.
[2022-12-01T00:55:20] Gordan Gizdic: Natural airflow at speed and forced cooling if needed.
[2022-12-01T00:55:42] Gordan Gizdic: So yeah, if anyone needs stl, feel free to ask. Its free.
[2022-12-01T01:04:42] Gordan Gizdic: Why not? Im not here to make money, im here to help and learn.
[2022-12-01T01:04:48] Gordan Gizdic: So fuck yeah, its free.

[2022-12-01T23:30:09] Mehmet √ñz: Hi
[2022-12-01T23:30:27] Mehmet √ñz: I got an error in the installation. The memory was deleted.how do i upload with stlink.
[2022-12-01T23:32:08] Mehmet √ñz: now ,it is brick
[2022-12-01T23:33:59] Mehmet √ñz: Flipsky 75100 no longer recognizes
[2022-12-01T23:34:56] Mehmet √ñz: But I think it can be installed directly with VESC software with STLink.
[2022-12-01T23:35:12] Mehmet √ñz: is it true?
[2022-12-01T23:36:37] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-12-01T23:37:50] Mehmet √ñz: how?
[2022-12-01T23:38:45] Mehmet √ñz: https://github.com/vedderb/nrf51_vesc
[2022-12-01T23:39:28] Mehmet √ñz: I couldn't find an explanation for stlink
[2022-12-01T23:40:50] Mehmet √ñz: only said vedder ;The code can be build with the NRF51822 sdk by changing the path in Makefile, but for convenience a prebuild hex file is also included. It can be uploaded with openocd by running the following script: ./upload_merged
[2022-12-01T23:44:25] Mehmet √ñz: vedder said openosd
[2022-12-02T00:06:47] rosheee: Vedder scam

[2022-12-02T12:07:59] Gordan Gizdic: I dont wanna do this in the garage, so i have to wait untill the rain goes away so i can do it in open space.
[2022-12-02T12:07:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Picture tells differentüòÅ

[2022-12-02T12:10:03] Gordan Gizdic: Just if something goes to fuckerino, to not burn down the car/garage/equipment.
[2022-12-02T12:10:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Unsure about something? Like i cant imagine i do such outside ü§î
[2022-12-02T12:10:26] Gordan Gizdic: Im never sure about anything. Especially with lipos
[2022-12-02T12:10:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Ohh just measure and think over

[2022-12-02T12:11:59] Gordan Gizdic: Charging ports and to power the buck converters.

[2022-12-02T12:15:24] Gordan Gizdic: I do that but theres always that 0.1% that i missed something. If i can avoid, ill go for that option. Not because im scared or because of some trauma. Its because my brain works on logic and thats fucked up sometimes.
[2022-12-02T12:15:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: There is a few stock scooters i love ,what has same plugs Kugoo is the best in this ,same plugs same color ,instaled like puked spagetti üòÅ
[2022-12-02T12:20:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I get you and here we make things like double,tripple check With 4 eyes, usually i am maniac securing stuff coz mainly it's not mine , it's for Customers
[2022-12-02T12:27:53] Gordan Gizdic: The worst. I dont do anything for anyone. I got a couple of job offerings to do on others peoples scooters. Fuck no. No way, turned them all down.
[2022-12-02T12:28:22] Gordan Gizdic: Too much time, they dont know what and how and everything in 5mins or less for a dollar or euro max.
[2022-12-02T12:28:31] Gordan Gizdic: Thats not how you do things proper.
[2022-12-02T12:39:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yeah i get that

[2022-12-02T12:46:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also building is one thing and ti finalise cable's another,not to mention if body will let you keep water Outside
[2022-12-02T15:45:22] Gordan Gizdic: <video_file>
[2022-12-02T15:45:24] Gordan Gizdic: Almost done. Shitload of support.
[2022-12-02T15:50:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I am not a fan of fans , body is closed

[2022-12-02T15:50:28] Gordan Gizdic: Thats support.
[2022-12-02T15:50:32] Gordan Gizdic: For rhe roof.
[2022-12-02T15:50:47] Gordan Gizdic: Front, rear and fan are all open.
[2022-12-02T15:50:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Roof üòÖ me lost
[2022-12-02T15:51:03] Gordan Gizdic: Ah, depends how you look at it.
[2022-12-02T15:51:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What
[2022-12-02T15:51:17] Gordan Gizdic: <photos/photo_6900@02-12-2022_15-51-17.jpg>
[2022-12-02T15:51:25] Gordan Gizdic: Its gonna look like this.
[2022-12-02T15:51:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I ment Scooter body is closed ,kinda reasonless to use fans
[2022-12-02T15:51:53] Gordan Gizdic: <photos/photo_6895@01-12-2022_01-06-38.jpg>
[2022-12-02T15:52:05] Gordan Gizdic: Ah..
[2022-12-02T15:52:18] Gordan Gizdic: But vesc is directly connected to this heatsink.
[2022-12-02T15:52:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: After air is warm no effect
[2022-12-02T15:52:37] Jan: You blow the warm air nowhere
[2022-12-02T15:52:39] Gordan Gizdic: So all of the heat will go out of the body
[2022-12-02T15:52:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I use to do it like this
[2022-12-02T15:53:10] Jan: Its not effective with the fan sorry
[2022-12-02T15:53:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But everyone is doing ad they want
[2022-12-02T15:53:20] Gordan Gizdic: Again.
[2022-12-02T15:53:25] Gordan Gizdic: Ill repeat.
[2022-12-02T15:53:30] Jan: üòÇüòÇ
[2022-12-02T15:53:37] Gordan Gizdic: Air will flow through it all the time.
[2022-12-02T15:53:47] Gordan Gizdic: But fan will assist this airflow.
[2022-12-02T15:53:51] Gordan Gizdic: Not restrict it.
[2022-12-02T15:54:47] Jan: Ok we will be happy to see vesc temps and power üëçüòÅ
[2022-12-02T15:55:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Fix vesc with good thermal solution to body or an adapter depends on vesc and polish surfaces to mirror, than other side of it (outer side gets the heatsink coz there us airflow
[2022-12-02T15:55:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Thought body you mean üòè
[2022-12-02T15:56:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: ?
[2022-12-02T15:56:06] Gordan Gizdic: <photos/photo_6902@02-12-2022_15-56-06.jpg>
[2022-12-02T15:56:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Ok
[2022-12-02T15:56:47] Gordan Gizdic: No, this is going over the heatsink. Heatsink is outside of the body.
[2022-12-02T15:56:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I am with Jan
[2022-12-02T15:56:55] Gordan Gizdic: Its under the scooter.
[2022-12-02T15:57:08] Gordan Gizdic: And vesc is connected to this heatsink.
[2022-12-02T15:57:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So half way you did like said above,just put this fan on top thingy
[2022-12-02T15:58:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I mean inside,will have no real effect
[2022-12-02T15:58:25] Gordan Gizdic: <video_file>
[2022-12-02T15:58:40] Gordan Gizdic: Outside. All of this is going outside.
[2022-12-02T15:58:45] Jan: Im just gonna wait for logfiles. We had some world record worthy ones already. From 0-100¬∞C in 5sec üëå
[2022-12-02T15:58:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But you get zoom effect fast
[2022-12-02T15:59:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I mean small fan not desingned to shake short time it will make noise
[2022-12-02T15:59:15] Gordan Gizdic: This is just a protection with fan on it.
[2022-12-02T16:00:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: As you like ,we dont speak against you believe me
[2022-12-02T16:00:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I see you want best solution We say fan will not improve
[2022-12-02T16:01:04] Gordan Gizdic: Fan is meant to help only with hill climbs.
[2022-12-02T16:01:09] Gordan Gizdic: Slow hill climbs.
[2022-12-02T16:01:30] Gordan Gizdic: When there is not enough airflow being generated by speed.
[2022-12-02T16:02:01] Gordan Gizdic: Thats why i left the front and back opened. To get that airflow at speed.
[2022-12-02T16:02:17] Gordan Gizdic: Also, im not gonna push near as much as you do.
[2022-12-02T16:02:33] Jan: I see your logic and it totally makes sense. But the motors will be then the second problem
[2022-12-02T16:02:56] Gordan Gizdic: Overheating?
[2022-12-02T16:03:09] Jan: Depends on which one you have
[2022-12-02T16:03:19] Gordan Gizdic: 1400w, stock vsett 10.
[2022-12-02T16:03:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Starts like thisüòÅ

[2022-12-02T16:03:46] Jan: While controller at 30¬∞C
[2022-12-02T16:04:15] Gordan Gizdic: I know, i know. But im not a push it hard rider. Im long distance rider. üòÅ
[2022-12-02T16:04:22] Jan: Ok
[2022-12-02T16:04:43] Jan: If possible, install a temp sensor in the rear motor
[2022-12-02T16:05:02] Jan: They get pretty hot under load
[2022-12-02T16:05:31] Gordan Gizdic: Yup, will do. Also, i talked to my dealer here in Croatia. Told them to get a few motors in stash for me. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2022-12-02T16:05:54] Gordan Gizdic: Im friends wirh them and i do this in coop with them.
[2022-12-02T16:05:58] Jan: Nice

[2022-12-02T16:25:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: From you ?
[2022-12-02T16:25:24] Jan: Yes
[2022-12-02T16:25:42] Jan: I'm developing one
[2022-12-02T16:26:01] Jan: Either i go for a one off carbon fiber build or i design a mass produced product for later
[2022-12-02T16:26:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: They are 50km near me, my friend tried it.
[2022-12-02T16:26:05] Jan: yes from scratch

[2022-12-02T16:27:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: 50mm
[2022-12-02T16:27:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: Hahaha rion inspiration
[2022-12-02T16:27:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is like a vsett motor in 11inch
[2022-12-02T16:28:04] sombre_enfant: How they do 120kph on this setup ???
[2022-12-02T16:28:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Fake specs I think
[2022-12-02T16:28:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: But even could be possible with vesc
[2022-12-02T16:29:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: 15s and reached 112kmh with 14kW around
[2022-12-02T16:29:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: 16S 118Kmh 10.5inch
[2022-12-02T16:29:55] sombre_enfant: With flipsky 75100ü§î
[2022-12-02T16:30:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: W?
[2022-12-02T16:30:26] Jan: The carbon fiber is even more unprofessional than Rion Motors
[2022-12-02T16:30:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: 16kW
[2022-12-02T16:30:59] Jan: Maybe, for now i stick with the P42A
[2022-12-02T16:31:44] Jan: Maybe another G30, with more ground clearance
[2022-12-02T16:32:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: Suce, with rage vesc?
[2022-12-02T16:32:29] Face de Pin Suc√©: Kelly üòÇ
[2022-12-02T16:32:37] Jan: In some rare cases i touch the floor when going down a ramp or changing to pedestrian walk
[2022-12-02T16:32:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: Which motor? The 33x2 65h of WEPED?
[2022-12-02T16:33:00] Face de Pin Suc√©: You don't remember my videos on Weped a year and a half ago ?
[2022-12-02T16:33:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: 75H
[2022-12-02T16:33:08] Jan: So 17-20mm more groundclearance could be possible. But need new alu spintend esc and ant bms
[2022-12-02T16:33:42] Jan: Yes
[2022-12-02T16:33:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: Oh now I get, our stats was with 22x3 60h + vesc
[2022-12-02T16:33:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: Using Field Weakening?
[2022-12-02T16:33:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yah
[2022-12-02T16:34:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: Otherwise freewheel can‚Äôt even reach this speed
[2022-12-02T16:35:23] Jan: Underneath the frame is 40mm. It works fine but have more clearance makes it more daily usable
[2022-12-02T16:49:50] Jan: Yes but better design
[2022-12-02T16:56:18] Jan: Yes
[2022-12-02T16:56:23] Jan: Target weight 8kg
[2022-12-02T16:57:06] Jan: They will follow
[2022-12-02T16:57:12] Jan: Everythibg
[2022-12-02T16:57:32] Jan: You have a target in mind and see how far the rest goes
[2022-12-02T16:57:44] Jan: Battery and motors making the most weight
[2022-12-02T16:58:04] Jan: So small light motor
[2022-12-02T16:58:14] Jan: Small bat
[2022-12-02T16:59:55] Jan: RWD
[2022-12-02T16:59:59] Jan: only
[2022-12-02T17:00:08] Jan: and a drum brake front
[2022-12-02T17:00:18] Jan: 500W spec
[2022-12-02T17:00:20] Jan: for production
[2022-12-02T17:01:24] Jan: Yes
[2022-12-02T17:01:43] Jan: I was thinking about it for weeks, its really really hard to solve
[2022-12-02T17:02:30] Jan: Its a balance between -price / weight / durability
[2022-12-02T17:03:17] Jan: Also lightweight suspension
[2022-12-02T17:03:22] Jan: Yes
[2022-12-02T17:03:59] Jan: Suspension reduces fatigue failure on the frame
[2022-12-02T17:04:40] Jan: Yeah looks fine for what it does
[2022-12-02T17:06:51] Jan: Yeah
[2022-12-02T23:00:52] Gordan Gizdic: <video_file>
[2022-12-02T23:01:05] Gordan Gizdic: Not the best video and it was just a test fit. But you get the idea. Fan was turned on manually just to hear how loud it is.
[2022-12-02T23:02:57] Jan: how loud?
[2022-12-02T23:08:42] Gordan Gizdic: Actually not that bad.
[2022-12-02T23:08:57] Gordan Gizdic: If you had you helmet on, you wouldnt even hear it.
[2022-12-02T23:09:33] Gordan Gizdic: Yeah, its not the most powerful fan but than again, its just a help and not the main way of cooling
[2022-12-03T00:05:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Ohh you ment all this outside,not on vesc
[2022-12-03T00:06:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well i am sure still that fan is useless,just for now it will die from dust üòÅ Yeah i am such positive fella
[2022-12-03T00:08:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Just for an example, maybe you have a room fan or had back in the day When fan gets dirty ,even smallest layer of dust sits on it ,pushes much less air
[2022-12-03T00:08:20] Gordan Gizdic: I know but like i said, this is just a test fit.
[2022-12-03T00:08:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If you just get dust off ,magic fan effective again
[2022-12-03T00:08:54] Gordan Gizdic: Im gonna use mesh on all of the openings and ill dust it here and there.
[2022-12-03T00:09:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also bit worried about Outside 5 v there
[2022-12-03T00:09:26] Gordan Gizdic: 12V there.
[2022-12-03T00:09:36] Gordan Gizdic: Its 12V, 0.6A fan.
[2022-12-03T00:09:42] Gordan Gizdic: Has some grunt to it.
[2022-12-03T00:10:15] Gordan Gizdic: But ill go again, this is just a proof of concept done in 5min.
[2022-12-03T00:10:23] Gordan Gizdic: Even the fan is not screwed in.
[2022-12-03T00:10:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also dont take these bad ,i am just brainstorming,like imagine as siting next to you with a beer , Sometimes saying looks dry but just enough rich in nice words
[2022-12-03T00:10:34] Gordan Gizdic: I wanted to test and hear how loud it is.
[2022-12-03T00:11:01] Gordan Gizdic: Nah, mate. No worries. Not taking any neg energy from this.
[2022-12-03T00:11:18] Gordan Gizdic: Would like to have a beer with you, would be better.
[2022-12-03T00:11:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Listens after a dirt road üòÅ I would bet money on sound change üòÖ
[2022-12-03T00:11:34] Gordan Gizdic: But i guess the mileage is kinda big. üòÇ
[2022-12-03T00:11:59] Gordan Gizdic: Ofc, i had like 10 RC cars, i know what dirt it.
[2022-12-03T00:12:01] Gordan Gizdic: Trust me.
[2022-12-03T00:12:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well if you come ,let me know
[2022-12-03T00:12:34] Gordan Gizdic: https://youtu.be/SnlRz7J67rY
[2022-12-03T00:12:46] Gordan Gizdic: This thingy gave me shitload of issues wirh heat.
[2022-12-03T00:13:05] Gordan Gizdic: Leaves and grass would go into cooling ducts and cause tons of problems.
[2022-12-03T00:13:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Small possibility that i go Zagreb again
[2022-12-03T00:13:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: According , the fan will no help, fan is used only if you don‚Äôt have airflow. Specially for small fan
[2022-12-03T00:13:27] Gordan Gizdic: If you do, pls let me know. Well arrange something. üëç
[2022-12-03T00:14:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: You can help cooling with peltier cells if you want üòÅ
[2022-12-03T00:14:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: But the consumption is big
[2022-12-03T00:14:48] Gordan Gizdic: Fan is not meant to do the work. Its primary job is to help at slow climbs and after stopping. Nothing more and nothing less.
[2022-12-03T00:14:57] Gordan Gizdic: Its not even active below 50 degrees.
[2022-12-03T00:15:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yeah true
[2022-12-03T00:15:24] Gordan Gizdic: Thought about it. Nah, not gonna fck with that now.
[2022-12-03T00:15:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I was thinking on trying that,but long term doesnt worth it
[2022-12-03T00:15:55] Gordan Gizdic: Im down with anything that requires brainstorming.
[2022-12-03T00:16:08] Gordan Gizdic: Apart sex. I somehow managed to make 2 kods.
[2022-12-03T00:16:16] Gordan Gizdic: At least i think i made them.
[2022-12-03T00:16:20] Gordan Gizdic: üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2022-12-03T00:16:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also ,if you mounted vesc good , thermal pads inside not dried also pasted outside a d maybe all was shiny like mirror all should be fine
[2022-12-03T00:21:09] Gordan Gizdic: I did all that, yes.
[2022-12-03T00:21:28] Gordan Gizdic: All new pad, new paste and stuff.
[2022-12-03T00:21:45] Gordan Gizdic: So yeah, in normal usage i dont expect problems.
[2022-12-03T00:27:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Did any of you tried geared type hub engine with vesc?
[2022-12-03T11:48:33] Konstantin: Daly 400a. Will install new logic board, stock is boolsht
[2022-12-03T11:48:56] Konstantin: 40+40 fets, 100v 190a 3mOhm
[2022-12-03T11:48:59] Mirono escooters: Which logic board?
[2022-12-03T11:49:04] Mirono escooters: Big af 400a
[2022-12-03T11:49:05] Konstantin: Llt ;)
[2022-12-03T11:50:03] Jan: Why would you need a 400A Daly BMS?
[2022-12-03T11:50:10] Konstantin: 40 shunts, like 0.05mOhm in total, wayting patrs, will be fun ;)
[2022-12-03T11:51:52] Konstantin: Sometimes they shing time Is awful... They don't care about us. Shot story: purses one, wait 90 days, and they told me, sorry, out of stock;)))
[2022-12-03T11:52:06] Konstantin: 4*kls7218
[2022-12-03T11:53:28] Konstantin: Epic soft/hard part...

[2022-12-03T11:53:42] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: looks brand new
[2022-12-03T11:54:18] Konstantin: Y, not used... And work mb few min.... Haha...
[2022-12-03T12:10:14] Mirono escooters: Looks fun
[2022-12-03T12:25:12] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Looks like mr.Venom is very interested in those boards. Be careful with them
[2022-12-03T12:25:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: ü§£
[2022-12-03T12:25:39] Mirono escooters: Waterproofing seems working xD
[2022-12-03T12:26:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Maybe i ovethink,but sounds like venom cumü§£
[2022-12-03T22:53:17] Gordan Gizdic: Wohoo.. wiring. Fun moments that extend to eternity. üòÇ
[2022-12-03T23:00:42] Gordan Gizdic: Idk, chinese way of thinking. Who knows.
[2022-12-03T23:03:15] Mirono escooters: It isnt
[2022-12-03T23:03:20] Mirono escooters: That vesc is their worst overheating
[2022-12-03T23:03:29] Mirono escooters: On dual it's not latching
[2022-12-03T23:03:50] Mirono escooters: Indeed
[2022-12-03T23:05:21] Mirono escooters: F
[2022-12-03T23:09:00] koxx / Francois Deslandes: üò±üò±
[2022-12-03T23:09:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: whouhouuuu ! geniouses !
[2022-12-03T23:11:05] koxx / Francois Deslandes: less components ... just have to route power stage enable signal for a "latched switch"...
[2022-12-03T23:15:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Led in the switch ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2022-12-03T23:17:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What you mean 3 pin , it's late for me
[2022-12-03T23:17:47] Mirono escooters: Probably
[2022-12-03T23:20:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And you dont have there button?
[2022-12-03T23:20:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Flip also has this mix of buttons,4 -5 wire with resistor loop
[2022-12-03T23:21:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Probably cant be done,but ask them
[2022-12-03T23:23:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Actually ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ Makers and flip has kinda same ,but most expensive flip had 4 pin and half size button ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ but was much easy for us , coz changed to key
[2022-12-03T23:27:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well i love my older spintend button thats true, i will take closer look when i modify that setup ,but that's few weeks atleast Also these stupid buttons drive us nuts
[2022-12-03T23:29:11] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: he has to be confused üòü
[2022-12-03T23:31:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: In some scenario if you would like to use a key ,it takes like 20 seconds to turn off , however you turned off already power runs out in that time ,so if you have lights on They are on, If you press throttle it accelerates Till it empty circuits power ,you can consume energy from battery,all coz not used stupid button
[2022-12-03T23:34:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I cant explain to you ,maybe @SirGeoff but there can be so much differences and when you start to mix brands üôà even worse
[2022-12-03T23:35:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like some has red to show you error or it loads ,some keeps same blue color however its frozen to shit and you have to power off
[2022-12-03T23:40:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Ppl Could explain who speaks fluently in electronüòÅ me metal head
[2022-12-03T23:42:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well somebody has to do it
[2022-12-03T23:44:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Usually i like to smart out where and how all enters and where things can sit ,than fix them and step by step ,before hand is Sometimes wiring is longer But i hate to redo or modify And usually pissed and angry if that happens üòÖ
[2022-12-03T23:51:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Todays fun like that was to power a induction heater to fuck with smaller metal parts so i dont need to use flame welder to heat stuff to red
[2022-12-03T23:52:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Kinda fun stuff and gas prices are high ,but welding gases were never cheapüòÖ so imagine now
[2022-12-03T23:55:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And motherfuckers now want to make all gases with time limit ü§î so gas cylinder is not yours ,they land you for a time and u need to use up gas or loose that gas üòí
[2022-12-03T23:56:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I mean in that time period ,instant Will kill all small business Some of the gases already like this ,like the one what you fill in air conditioner
[2022-12-03T23:57:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: From money side yes ,if you use it all day it doesnt change your life
[2022-12-03T23:58:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But if you use out a full cylinder in an year not worths it to have at all
[2022-12-03T23:59:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also nowdays to make stupid decisions is contagious wwüòÖ
[2022-12-04T12:15:15] Unknown: Wtf How i get this out?
[2022-12-04T12:17:16] Mirono escooters: Slide
[2022-12-04T12:17:26] Mirono escooters: U forgot 3 mosfet screws
[2022-12-04T13:13:36] Gordan Gizdic: Take out those 3 screws on the right than you should be able to slide it out.

[2022-12-04T13:35:52] Gordan Gizdic: Done, finished and ready for driving.
[2022-12-04T13:36:17] Gordan Gizdic: Now all i got to survive is this shitty rain period. Hope to end soon.
[2022-12-04T13:36:23] Gordan Gizdic: Thnx for all the help.

[2022-12-04T13:52:36] francois schempers: guys, i had an idea, since riding a scooter is more start and stop when you ride in a city or when you have a hills to climb, you only need loads of power for an instant, what about using those, you can discharge at 4Kw for 10s, and have rudiculously fasft charge, so here is the idea, you combine both technologie, a few graphene capacitor for big power need, like a crazy strong acceleration, then continue with regular battery, and you charge back de graphene in the mean time, so you can have huge torque and acceleration for short burst. the new graphene capacitor have a 30 min of autonomie before recharge, so this could really be use to maximise power and only have power when you need it, you dont need 4kw of power for your whole run, you don't use that much when maintaining speed. so you can have burst of power only when needed. plus you could have crazy strong motor brakes if you make it fill up the supercapacitor
[2022-12-04T13:53:23] francois schempers: plus it does 8kw 1s burst
[2022-12-04T13:57:57] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it seem too incredible to be true
[2022-12-04T13:58:29] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: and if it's true, it's probably fucking expensive like 100~0‚Ç¨/cell
[2022-12-04T13:58:32] francois schempers: we don' have prices yet, so graphene could be crazy expensive too x)
[2022-12-04T13:58:42] francois schempers: yeah
[2022-12-04T13:59:10] francois schempers: here is their website https://www.skeletontech.com/
[2022-12-04T14:01:06] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: have lots of company like that with impossible crazy project to get invest but.. nothing real
[2022-12-04T14:01:38] francois schempers: yeah, that's the story of graphene product for the past 30 years xD
[2022-12-04T14:02:05] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: graphene and other.. üòÑ
[2022-12-04T14:02:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: Years ago was talking about sand battery, nuclear diamond battery, sell from next year bla bla and nothing true
[2022-12-04T14:02:33] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: of course
[2022-12-04T14:02:40] Happy Giraffe: I think F22 Raptor becomes available in Aliexpress before graphene batts/cells
[2022-12-04T14:02:50] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: they know at start its not possible it's just to get money
[2022-12-04T14:03:38] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it's scam at level of invest
[2022-12-04T14:04:05] francois schempers: so, if we exclude graphene capacitor, is it possible with regular super capacitor ? or is to too short to produce any meaningfull torque burst
[2022-12-04T14:07:14] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: no
[2022-12-04T14:07:48] Mirono escooters: Super caps are heavy and still lack capacity for any real power
[2022-12-04T14:08:32] Mirono escooters: Maybe a second if u fill half ur frame lol
[2022-12-04T14:09:16] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it's useless, size / weight / capacity is shit, so if you use only capacitor you will have 1km autonomy and if you mix cell and caps you will reduce your capacity but also can't using the caps cuz of internal resistor of the cells and the voltage drop
[2022-12-04T14:10:03] Mirono escooters: And those caps aren't cheap
[2022-12-04T14:10:14] Mirono escooters: Then u better of lipo and being careful
[2022-12-04T14:11:11] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yes or normal cell
[2022-12-04T14:11:21] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: like my scooter or wheel
[2022-12-04T14:11:41] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: I regen until 4.5kw
[2022-12-04T14:11:52] Mirono escooters: Add pedals for b≈ìst
[2022-12-04T14:13:10] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: or mechanical inertia, you saw one guy try that on bike? üòÇ
[2022-12-04T14:13:21] Mirono escooters: Yeap
[2022-12-04T14:13:27] Mirono escooters: Was fun physics
[2022-12-04T14:15:04] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: https://youtu.be/gahKxbwUcYw
[2022-12-04T14:15:11] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: he also try with capacitors
[2022-12-04T14:15:22] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: https://youtu.be/V_f8Q2_Q_J0
[2022-12-04T14:15:30] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: conclusion, everything is shit
[2022-12-04T14:15:38] Mirono escooters: Tom is a special person
[2022-12-04T14:15:41] Mirono escooters: But very smart
[2022-12-04T14:15:58] Mirono escooters: We knew that before he build it, it's more curiosity and learning
[2022-12-04T14:17:46] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yeah sure
[2022-12-04T14:18:02] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it's nice the d√©monstration like that
[2022-12-04T14:18:34] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: for shut up the free energy believer
[2022-12-04T14:19:32] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but by concept it should be good to can get the energy at brake in accumulator and use that same energy to accelerate the problem is the efficiency of conversion and storage
[2022-12-04T14:20:37] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: super cap have very low density of energy so if you put that in place of battery to reduce a lot of range, and the best batt cell actually it's still not a lot density of energy üòÇ

[2022-12-05T00:05:02] Gordan Gizdic: It does.. but like i said, its just material. I mean, i dont wreck my stuff like a moron but i dont personalise my stuff... never thought about it. Yeah, no... its just stuff. :)
[2022-12-05T00:23:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: As you like bro
[2022-12-05T00:23:39] Mirono escooters: Scooter is bae

[2022-12-05T10:48:28] gil guy: Yes . Place an AC voltmeter on phases ..you will see it.
[2022-12-05T11:07:35] Jan: Someone suggested "G30 Widowmaker" as a reminder of how dangerous it is.
[2022-12-05T11:07:42] Jan: Bit long but seems fit
[2022-12-05T11:52:34] Mirko Boni: Woow fantastic...
[2022-12-05T17:37:35] Happy Giraffe: If I connect the 12v Torque sensor that outputs 1.5-3.3v will it be ok like this? I don't know if I should use the adc1 gnd or the 12v aux gnd for it.
[2022-12-05T17:37:53] Mirono escooters: Adc1 i say
[2022-12-05T17:41:28] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, people said something about creating loops so I am very careful
[2022-12-05T20:24:20] sombre_enfant: @thierry333 hi do you remember spacing of mosfet hole on flipsky 75100 ? 10.46?
[2022-12-05T21:03:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Want me to measure it ?
[2022-12-05T22:56:48] Thierry: 10.8mm
[2022-12-05T23:16:24] rosheee: Yo 14awg OK for charging 8-10A?
[2022-12-05T23:16:32] rosheee: Cable like 10cm max
[2022-12-05T23:17:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: I use 14awg for 30A too üòÇ cable hot but ok
[2022-12-05T23:17:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: 20A continuos rated
[2022-12-05T23:17:57] rosheee: XD so ok for 10A
[2022-12-05T23:17:59] rosheee: Nice thx
[2022-12-06T09:33:51] Happy Giraffe: Lenght increases resistance
[2022-12-06T09:34:10] Happy Giraffe: If cable is 5cm then it survives much more than 3m
[2022-12-06T09:35:05] Happy Giraffe: I got massive vdrops using long cables, then switched the extension to thicker cable and vdrop disappeared
[2022-12-06T09:38:54] Mirono escooters: Logical
[2022-12-06T12:57:42] rosheee: Yes ^^' but that is normal
[2022-12-06T13:47:32] Happy Giraffe: Didn't receive the message about it being so short, it's good for that
[2022-12-06T13:53:59] rosheee: Here
[2022-12-06T13:54:06] rosheee: Here
[2022-12-06T13:54:58] Gordan Gizdic: <video_file>
[2022-12-06T13:55:02] Gordan Gizdic: Test drive went fine. Everything works.
[2022-12-06T13:55:28] Gordan Gizdic: Current settings are 90A batt, 45x2 so 90 in total and motors are at 130A.
[2022-12-06T13:55:55] Gordan Gizdic: But, it cut out on me 2 times when punching it from stand still.
[2022-12-06T13:56:08] Gordan Gizdic: I tested more and it didnt happen after anymore.
[2022-12-06T13:56:22] Gordan Gizdic: Not a single cut at speeds above 10kmh.
[2022-12-06T13:56:32] Jan: The temps üò≥
[2022-12-06T13:56:35] Gordan Gizdic: Just those 2 times at the begginig.
[2022-12-06T13:57:15] Gordan Gizdic: No error also recorded anywhere. Just like overcurrent cut. At least it felt like that.
[2022-12-06T13:58:07] Jan: 4.7kW at 250A bat. Thats not even 19V
[2022-12-06T13:58:51] Gordan Gizdic: Honestly, i guess not. Was to busy testing to see if all works.
[2022-12-06T13:59:02] Gordan Gizdic: Huh?
[2022-12-06T13:59:13] Gordan Gizdic: Dont know. Ill check.
[2022-12-06T13:59:17] Jan: <photos/photo_6920@06-12-2022_13-59-17.jpg>
[2022-12-06T14:00:06] Gordan Gizdic: Could be, happened twice and i couldnt make it happen after even though i tried many times.
[2022-12-06T14:00:36] Gordan Gizdic: Yup, exactly.
[2022-12-06T14:00:50] Gordan Gizdic: Thats motor current.
[2022-12-06T14:00:55] Gordan Gizdic: Combined.
[2022-12-06T14:01:03] Gordan Gizdic: So around 125A per motor.
[2022-12-06T14:01:32] Gordan Gizdic: Nah, batt current is at 90A and it goes to 90A than slowly goes down to 80ish.
[2022-12-06T14:01:57] Gordan Gizdic: Batt packs can deliver max 160A so no worries there.
[2022-12-06T14:02:04] Gordan Gizdic: Not even sagging that much.
[2022-12-06T14:03:28] Gordan Gizdic: I did set the slow abs overcurrent but i left the amps stock.
[2022-12-06T14:03:39] Gordan Gizdic: Probably around 20ish amps if i recall.
[2022-12-06T14:03:50] Gordan Gizdic: But i could be saying something stupid.
[2022-12-06T14:03:58] Gordan Gizdic: Havent checked. I know its stock.
[2022-12-06T14:04:21] Gordan Gizdic: Ill check, cant atm.
[2022-12-06T14:05:16] Gordan Gizdic: Ok, thnx a lot. Ill check later.
[2022-12-06T14:05:28] Gordan Gizdic: Im sure that i left this setting stock.
[2022-12-06T14:05:35] Gordan Gizdic: I just did the slow part.
[2022-12-06T14:05:49] Jan: üëç
[2022-12-06T14:06:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You can view few things even without that , forgets menu name ü§îü§îü§î
[2022-12-06T14:07:41] Gordan Gizdic: I agree.
[2022-12-06T14:07:46] Gordan Gizdic: I noticed same things.
[2022-12-06T14:08:03] Gordan Gizdic: Its stupid you cant customise this setting.
[2022-12-06T14:08:13] Gordan Gizdic: But hey, at least it works.
[2022-12-06T14:12:45] Gordan Gizdic: Whats like safeish setting with the vsett 10 motors for phase current?
[2022-12-06T14:12:58] Gordan Gizdic: 130/140/150?
[2022-12-06T14:13:27] Gordan Gizdic: I mean, dont wanna push it but just to know what it can sustain long term and short term. Kinda...
[2022-12-06T14:14:16] Gordan Gizdic: Without temp probe its hard but lets say what kind of amps should it sustain in prolonged driving and what kind of amps are not good for longer drives.
[2022-12-06T14:14:40] Gordan Gizdic: I feel like 130 should be quite ok and i shouldnt need to expect overheating.
[2022-12-06T14:15:10] Gordan Gizdic: But can it hold more for idk.. 50kmh drives with a short full beans short bursts?
[2022-12-06T14:16:37] rosheee: Voltage 2 low or bms amps
[2022-12-06T14:16:47] rosheee: 250
[2022-12-06T14:16:51] rosheee: With 20S
[2022-12-06T14:16:57] rosheee: Nah 180A is peak
[2022-12-06T14:17:18] rosheee: We get 250A-290A peak with 2 motors Phase
[2022-12-06T14:17:22] Gordan Gizdic: Neither. Have got 160A available, 90A shouldnt be a problem.

[2022-12-06T14:18:11] rosheee: Hmm
[2022-12-06T14:19:17] Gordan Gizdic: I also think that this is the issue here.
[2022-12-06T14:19:23] Gordan Gizdic: Ill test that later.
[2022-12-06T14:19:38] Gordan Gizdic: Im more worried about settings that are not gonna shred motors.

[2022-12-06T14:19:56] Gordan Gizdic: Because im stupid and adrenaline took over
[2022-12-06T14:20:23] Gordan Gizdic: I need some pointers how to limit myself from destruction but not to limit the fun. üòÅ
[2022-12-06T14:21:41] Gordan Gizdic: Havent touched this.
[2022-12-06T14:22:01] Gordan Gizdic: Ofc.
[2022-12-06T14:22:14] Gordan Gizdic: Will do it but in time.
[2022-12-06T14:22:17] Gordan Gizdic: Cant atm.
[2022-12-06T14:22:32] Gordan Gizdic: I hardly found time to finish this...
[2022-12-06T14:23:10] Gordan Gizdic: I dont do water at all... Luckily. ü§£
[2022-12-06T14:23:36] Gordan Gizdic: üëç

[2022-12-06T14:51:30] Gordan Gizdic: Thats it?
[2022-12-06T14:51:33] Gordan Gizdic: Was 140A
[2022-12-06T14:51:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yes
[2022-12-06T14:52:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Try put higher like 250
[2022-12-06T14:52:13] Gordan Gizdic: Ok
[2022-12-06T14:52:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: As rs said
[2022-12-06T14:52:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: He not Always says big number coz his RS üòÅ He wants good
[2022-12-06T14:53:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also in few i am near one mine ,and check what i was talking about in menu
[2022-12-06T14:59:46] Gordan Gizdic: Abs current max 170, wont allow more.
[2022-12-06T15:00:03] Gordan Gizdic: Also, phase current max is 135A. Wont allow more.
[2022-12-06T15:00:19] Gordan Gizdic: Hw limits?
[2022-12-06T15:00:39] Gordan Gizdic: <video_file>

[2022-12-06T15:10:54] Gordan Gizdic: Ah.. not gonna fuck with that for now.
[2022-12-06T15:17:10] Gordan Gizdic: Cant set it. It limits me to 135.
[2022-12-06T15:21:26] sombre_enfant: Use no limit fw
[2022-12-06T15:26:33] Gordan Gizdic: This.
[2022-12-06T15:26:56] Gordan Gizdic: Max that it allows me is 135 phase and 170 absolute max.
[2022-12-06T15:27:05] Gordan Gizdic: So i guessed its fw locked.
[2022-12-06T15:31:45] Gordan Gizdic: I did it like that, no issues at all. Plenty fast for this weather and smooth as silk. Loving it. Wont be using no limits fw for now untill i sort ntc sensor. This is just enough for me.
[2022-12-06T15:37:16] Gordan Gizdic: Thnx. üëç

[2022-12-06T15:55:04] Gordan Gizdic: Went for a drive, 15ish mins of throttling and shit. This is the max temp i got.
[2022-12-06T15:55:14] Gordan Gizdic: Its 8degrees C outside.
[2022-12-06T15:55:40] Gordan Gizdic: Fan hasnt kicked in once. I guess cooling is working fine for my aplication. üòÅ
[2022-12-06T15:57:47] Gordan Gizdic: I mean its gonna go up a lot more but i cant see the problem here yet with this. Usually if it doesnt go up more than this at this weather, it shuldnt go more than 75ish in the summer. I maybe wrong ofc but from other applications i did, its usually this way.
[2022-12-06T15:58:11] Gordan Gizdic: And yeah, im not pushing that much power as you do. So this is just fine for me.

[2022-12-06T17:44:59] Jan: Resonance frequency
[2022-12-06T17:45:25] Jan: You have a couple of those along the way
[2022-12-06T17:45:28] Mirono escooters: Aha
[2022-12-06T17:46:07] Jan: Every machine has it
[2022-12-06T17:46:42] Jan: You always want to stay out of those over longer periods of time
[2022-12-06T17:47:09] Mirono escooters: Sounds logical
[2022-12-06T17:47:24] Mirono escooters: Didn't know our motors have resonating frequency at our speeds
[2022-12-06T17:47:32] Mirono escooters: Well 250kmh sure is alot xD
[2022-12-06T17:47:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: Because too high speed x)

[2022-12-07T00:01:30] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: man I want this for so long, but too lazy to make myself and to find one which can be disconnected again for a normal price is such a pain
[2022-12-07T00:03:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs pretty easy to mod it, if you want send me just the plug and I do it for you for free
[2022-12-07T00:05:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yeah i spent 1 month to understand how this shit works, they did a wrong schematic
[2022-12-07T00:06:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Don't have any plug here anyway, how much did you pay for yours?
[2022-12-07T00:07:00] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I have a schematic somewhere too, but well never took the time to build it
[2022-12-07T00:08:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: 70‚Ç¨ and though was working without any mod instead 39‚Ç¨ just for the plug

[2022-12-07T00:08:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: They used random resistance values, and I goes crazy for 2 weeks to understand why don‚Äôt work

[2022-12-07T00:12:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: And can‚Äôt change status because no button, so the charger block the plug even.

[2022-12-08T17:50:24] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_6934@08-12-2022_17-50-24.jpg>
[2022-12-08T17:51:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: Normal for that purpose we use carbon steel.
[2022-12-08T17:51:48] Mirko Boni: So mine are breaking down? correct?
[2022-12-08T17:52:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: No break, will bend. But is already much better than stock
[2022-12-08T17:53:05] Mirono escooters: XD way better
[2022-12-08T17:53:11] Mirono escooters: Stainless will work fine

[2022-12-08T18:11:24] Konstantin: 50/50. For my tasks 5.3 ok
[2022-12-08T18:12:22] Mirono escooters: Ok I just gotta fix my temp sensor mosfets being off before I burn it

[2022-12-08T18:15:14] Mirono escooters: It shoots up to 50 and down too easily
[2022-12-08T18:15:26] Mirono escooters: And reads 20 when not 20
[2022-12-08T18:15:35] Mirono escooters: I use different then original fw so

[2022-12-08T18:18:06] Mirono escooters: Ok ok I'll do it
[2022-12-08T18:18:13] Mirono escooters: It should be 75300/R3
[2022-12-08T18:18:16] Mirono escooters: But apperantly not
[2022-12-08T18:18:19] Mirono escooters: Other functions work
[2022-12-08T18:18:26] Mirono escooters: Tried some makerx firmware but then v was off. ü§®

[2022-12-08T18:31:45] Mirono escooters: They should atleast put that next to the big "HI100 needs custom firmware" text
[2022-12-08T18:36:54] Mirono escooters: "try 100250, old version use 75300"
[2022-12-08T18:37:05] Mirono escooters: Feel like I'm gonna brick it just trying shit
[2022-12-08T20:09:14] Mirono escooters: Hi100 is for newest apperantly..

[2022-12-08T20:17:11] Mirono escooters: Or not this one from helpdesk. He's useless :)
[2022-12-08T20:18:30] Mirono escooters: I will use 75300/R2. Temp sensor ok now, 11* read and garage +- that
[2022-12-08T20:18:37] Mirono escooters: Tomorrow I check how quickly goes up
[2022-12-08T20:18:47] Mirono escooters: Maybe was bug with old fw
[2022-12-08T20:29:23] Mirono escooters: Me too
[2022-12-08T20:29:32] Mirono escooters: 75300 fw works fine tho, it was just temp thing
[2022-12-08T20:29:48] Mirono escooters: But problably bugged now I se. Before it read 20* always, garage and on road before accel
[2022-12-08T20:29:54] Mirono escooters: It now gets to me it was 20* stuck
[2022-12-08T20:29:55] Mirono escooters: Now not
[2022-12-08T22:28:26] Santiago: I just measured mine cuz replacing them too, small ones are 25mm long (not counting the head), two 90mm and one 100mm long
[2022-12-08T22:30:12] Santiago: Nope since I'm not running a xiaomi motor anymore
[2022-12-08T22:31:02] Santiago: The zero 10x motor requires longer shoulder bolts for the suspension
[2022-12-08T22:31:23] Santiago: The shaft is longer so it barely fits without washers
[2022-12-08T22:31:51] Santiago: M365 pro 2
[2022-12-08T22:32:18] Mirono escooters: Don't ali got the longer ones u need?
[2022-12-08T22:32:22] Santiago: I think they are a bit longer but not sure
[2022-12-08T22:32:25] Mirono escooters: Inverted suspension?
[2022-12-08T22:32:38] Santiago: It's already inverted
[2022-12-08T22:32:51] Santiago: With longer bolts too
[2022-12-08T22:33:11] Santiago: From something a bought from monorim but idk what it was
[2022-12-08T22:33:33] Santiago: But hey longer bolts for the suspension üòÇ
[2022-12-08T22:33:49] Mirono escooters: Just good steel so it no bend
[2022-12-08T22:34:36] Santiago: I'll pay you that beer if I can't find anybody that ships fasterüòÇ
[2022-12-08T22:35:21] Santiago: Nope
[2022-12-08T22:35:43] Mirono escooters: Wrong time if u were a week sooner
[2022-12-08T22:36:24] Santiago: I could have done the measurements before but I couldn't be bothered, now I regret not doing it
[2022-12-08T22:43:54] Santiago: The inner washer here is missing and the plate is a bit bent so when you mount the caliper it isn't straight which means fucked
[2022-12-08T22:44:18] Mirono escooters: Oof
[2022-12-08T22:44:59] Santiago: I pray to God going downhill with rear brake onlyü•π
[2022-12-08T22:45:28] Mirono escooters: Oh boy
[2022-12-08T22:45:42] Mirono escooters: Brakes need good tolerances and monorim makes it a challenge not having it
[2022-12-08T22:46:53] Santiago: What dym?
[2022-12-08T22:49:21] Santiago: This should do the job
[2022-12-08T22:49:54] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2022-12-08T22:53:06] Jan: üò≥
[2022-12-08T22:53:14] Jan: Those chinesium brackets again
[2022-12-08T22:53:30] Jan: Worst quality ive ever seen
[2022-12-08T22:53:33] Mirono escooters: For 90% of users (Xiaomis) enough
[2022-12-08T22:53:49] Santiago: Do they break??
[2022-12-08T22:53:55] Mirono escooters: Making that custom would be fun. Would need the mill
[2022-12-08T22:53:56] Mirko Boni: Ha ha ha ha ha because of you I had to make them in steel.. Jan, do you remember? üòÇüòÇüòÇ

[2022-12-08T22:55:01] Santiago: In 4 weeks
[2022-12-08T22:55:10] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-12-08T22:55:14] Jan: We have not broken one but thr material is bad, the load paths are bad
[2022-12-08T22:55:25] Mirono escooters: Or it would be with a angle grinder but uh, let's do mill
[2022-12-08T22:56:31] Santiago: I want it steel but requires painting and the Chinese is already paintedüòÖ
[2022-12-08T22:57:10] Mirono escooters: And its alu I think
[2022-12-08T22:57:12] Santiago: They bend??
[2022-12-08T22:57:16] Mirono escooters: Painting steel isn't even that bad
[2022-12-08T22:57:42] Santiago: Thing is buying paint
[2022-12-08T22:57:48] Santiago: Just for one piece
[2022-12-08T22:58:22] Mirono escooters: I have paint :)
[2022-12-08T22:58:28] Mirono escooters: A spray bottle is here like 3‚Ç¨ lol

[2022-12-08T23:02:36] Mirono escooters: Vacation between
[2022-12-08T23:15:52] Jan: No they would probably just crack under too much load as there are stupid 90¬∞ angles in the loadpath
[2022-12-08T23:19:42] Santiago: I'll find out when it arrivesüòãüòã
[2022-12-08T23:23:37] Santiago: I bought from dualtron official store in Ali, hopefully it's good enough
[2022-12-08T23:26:01] Jan: Dualtron doesnt understand any mechanical engineering. There products are one of the worst mechanical engineering offenders in the market today
[2022-12-08T23:26:28] Jan: There stem design is the worst in the market
[2022-12-08T23:26:48] Jan: Hey but it least they got LED so people buy it
[2022-12-08T23:30:19] Santiago: RGB LEDs look so bad on any scooter

[2022-12-09T08:16:14] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: There are two different options. Cut-off which do not affect battery percentage and under "Additional Info", where you can select the series count of your battery (the same like u do, on setup), this is what the percentage is calculated on. It goes from 4,2v to 3v (0%), has a specific tuned curve (I think Samsung 30Q or smth idk)

[2022-12-09T21:37:18] Face de Pin Suc√©: You will need the motors and rim for those tyres
[2022-12-09T21:40:33] Face de Pin Suc√©: Only Weped I think
[2022-12-09T21:42:03] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes we are a little crazy about escooter here

[2022-12-09T21:48:19] Face de Pin Suc√©: I don't think so
[2022-12-09T21:49:11] Face de Pin Suc√©: No, I think it can be better
[2022-12-09T21:49:20] Face de Pin Suc√©: It depends of the whole geometry
[2022-12-09T21:50:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes we made a "100x" long time ago
[2022-12-09T21:50:41] Face de Pin Suc√©: Because many escooters has the front wheel too much backward

[2022-12-09T21:56:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's all about geometry and mass transfer
[2022-12-09T21:56:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes
[2022-12-09T21:57:39] Face de Pin Suc√©: Lowered the pole, wider the handlebar, lowered a little the shocks with good rigidity
[2022-12-09T21:57:57] Face de Pin Suc√©: It was cruising 115Kmh without problems at all
[2022-12-09T21:58:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, you can have a better position to be more aggressive on your escooter and you can put a lot of weight on the front, which helps to reduce wobble
[2022-12-09T22:00:12] Face de Pin Suc√©: <photos/photo_6953@09-12-2022_22-00-12.jpg>

[2022-12-10T11:34:47] S1m 0n: Does anyone know the AI ChatGPT? Sick shit I tell you üòÇ.. have me yesterday everything about kV explained by the AI. This is really sick shit, I tell you https://chat.openai.com/chat
[2022-12-10T11:35:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: Can you tell us what it says ?
[2022-12-10T11:38:04] S1m 0n: Not really. I communicated with him in German. If I now run everything through the translator again, something else will come out in the end. I asked the AI how to increase the KV or what happens when you remove a wire of the phases. I also asked how to make a Delta motor out of a Star motor, but the AI screwed up a bit and always referred to an expert person.
[2022-12-10T11:40:12] Mirono escooters: Thats cool
[2022-12-10T11:40:28] S1m 0n: Mega cool
[2022-12-10T11:41:36] S1m 0n: Can write code, can write an apologetic for your girlfriend.... explain technical things... I am not easily impressed, but the AI really amazes me
[2022-12-10T11:41:59] S1m 0n: Never do homework üòÇ
[2022-12-10T11:42:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I use it for school atm

[2022-12-10T11:42:30] Mirono escooters: Idk if dutch would work
[2022-12-10T11:42:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It should work
[2022-12-10T11:43:25] S1m 0n: Yes it can
[2022-12-10T11:43:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: The trick is to force the AI to do smth for you. We had a question in class, but the only response of the AI was "that makes no sense", but I told him "tell me even tho it makes no sense", and it did ... very well.
[2022-12-10T11:46:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But it always suprises me. I've used Replika for a while which was already pretty good talking to but man ChatGPT is next level.
[2022-12-10T11:47:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Replika has a different use-case of course and is not supposed to be as smart as ChatGPT, but the way how ChatGPT understand literally everything makes it so much better.
[2022-12-10T11:50:54] S1m 0n: I had seen a video where someone had programmed a simple ChatGPT website. if someone enters his birthday it will show how old you are. he told the AI ‚Äã‚Äãto make the website "prettier" and it actually did. however, it didn't show the correct age.. the guy in the video said "the code doesn't work, please revise the code"... and the website worked üòµ‚Äçüí´

[2022-12-10T15:24:10] Mirono escooters: Boring
[2022-12-10T15:25:06] S1m 0n: It works. When it becomes more specific about the individual components and compositions of various explosive powders, the AI becomes more talkative.

[2022-12-11T03:32:20] rosheee: When we started the Spintend, the first product we designed was targeting the V6 grade dual ESC without DRV8302. Benefited by the low material cost, and the new 75 300 project at that time, we adopted the excellent MOSFETs and drivers with 75 300 HW design principles. The design result was a surprise. We are not fast learner, the market and the money in our pocket did not allow us to have much time to maturing a single version. The Uboxes have two fields in changing: The VDD and the MCU IO.
[2022-12-11T03:32:25] rosheee: fuck the shit

[2022-12-11T09:43:59] Mirono escooters: Heatsink won't handle temperature like the white thing does
[2022-12-11T09:46:25] Mirono escooters: Huh? Open a door with bank card??
[2022-12-11T10:44:49] S1m 0n: Yesterday I checked my steering after just under 10k km. So far so good, except for a little rust. I had greased the shaft well at the time, but it does not seem to have prevented the rust completely... can you recommend something so that the part is not rusting again in a year ?
[2022-12-11T10:44:49] S1m 0n: <photos/photo_6985@11-12-2022_10-44-49.jpg>
[2022-12-11T10:55:59] Mirono escooters: Make from stainless steel ü•∏
[2022-12-11T10:56:02] Mirono escooters: Wd40?
[2022-12-11T10:58:15] Jan: Is that one of those famous Mantis collar clamp stems?
[2022-12-11T11:30:57] S1m 0n: Hehe yes. But I had a stainless steel bolt in it, instead of the hardened 12.9 steel. Is broken again after 1800km and far 800km. With stainless steel bolt now over 8000km
[2022-12-11T11:32:03] S1m 0n: I was actually going to upgrade to titanium, but titanium has about the same elongation at break as 12.9 hardened steel, so titanium would probably crack similarly quickly at this point
[2022-12-11T11:38:49] S1m 0n: actually not a bad idea ü§î.. I should ask the CNC people if it's "just like that" possible
[2022-12-11T11:42:37] Mirono escooters: If u can draw it ye sure
[2022-12-11T11:52:07] S1m 0n: No I do not..but I am currently refreshing a few welding certificates, which is why I "work" a training center. In the hall run around a lot of masters (otherwise I would not have known about the breaking strain at all üòÇ) and I know that all the trainees will soon have vacations, and most of the hall will be empty. So if someone can make me such a part "just on the fly", then one of the masters who teaches it every day üí°
[2022-12-11T11:54:01] S1m 0n: They also learnig about star-delta-starter üòÑ
[2022-12-11T11:54:11] Mirono escooters: For a engineer its ezpz drawing
[2022-12-11T11:54:37] S1m 0n: I hope üòÑ
[2022-12-11T11:54:38] Mirono escooters: Even i problably can if Id have it in hand
[2022-12-11T11:54:59] S1m 0n: But perhaps complete stainless steel is also too soft for the range ü§∑üèΩ‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2022-12-11T11:55:15] Mirono escooters: What other alternatives are there
[2022-12-11T11:55:32] Mirono escooters: 12.9 should B plenty
[2022-12-11T11:55:44] S1m 0n: I will check it tomorrow Nothing üòÇ Better grease
[2022-12-11T11:57:06] Mirono escooters: Grease is no wonder stuff tho
[2022-12-11T12:15:55] gil guy: Many time i want to make that with mosfets .. a 2nd speed for our motors..ü§™
[2022-12-11T12:17:44] gil guy: Is delta coupling eat more current than field weakening ? At high speed of course..üßê
[2022-12-11T12:18:36] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-12-11T12:19:26] gil guy: Ok. I note it..
[2022-12-11T12:22:57] gil guy: In delta , speed increase tehorically by 1.73(sqr3) .current too,and Torque decrease by 1.73 too. In field weakening, no torque reduction at high speed?
[2022-12-11T12:44:07] Mirono escooters: Original thing
[2022-12-11T12:44:10] Mirono escooters: Find in bigger
[2022-12-11T12:44:25] Mirono escooters: You weaken your magnetic field, wich requires more amps to compensate
[2022-12-11T12:44:30] Mirono escooters: Without compensation, yes
[2022-12-11T12:47:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, it is 24/7 shop and sometimes the doors lock after no-use and has to be opened again with bank card (stupid cuz imagine I only pay with smartphone...)
[2022-12-11T12:47:30] Mirono escooters: Yes I find it weird
[2022-12-11T12:47:44] Mirono escooters: Local hardware store should habe

[2022-12-11T21:09:49] Happy Giraffe: I should have had that today but didnt have motor cableüòÖ
[2022-12-11T21:10:15] Happy Giraffe: Basically they dont have regen braking because of the clutch
[2022-12-11T21:10:46] Happy Giraffe: Mine has a special one that allows it, should be super punchy brake with the 5:1 ratio
[2022-12-11T21:11:06] Happy Giraffe: Low speed torque and weight savings
[2022-12-11T21:12:20] Happy Giraffe: You can play around with the motor simulator at ebikes.ca
[2022-12-11T21:12:52] Happy Giraffe: https://ebikes.ca/tools/simulator.html
[2022-12-11T21:13:20] Happy Giraffe: Then you sacrifice topspeed and lose torque quickly
[2022-12-11T21:14:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: No, depends by how u gear itüòÇ
[2022-12-11T21:14:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: Maybe reduction , maybe contrary
[2022-12-11T21:16:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: True,but that's other lvl
[2022-12-11T21:17:18] Happy Giraffe: Ofc but this is what I have on my motor. Its lighter than Mxus 3k turbo 6t and has same torque from 12kmh~ and +10 topspeed
[2022-12-11T21:18:10] Happy Giraffe: Ofcourse you can pump bit more current to the Mxus but yeah heavier motor
[2022-12-11T21:18:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well expect some noise
[2022-12-11T21:18:35] Happy Giraffe: Should be silent, gotta test first tho
[2022-12-11T21:18:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I ment if you coult do custom gearing inside
[2022-12-11T21:18:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Nah
[2022-12-11T21:19:01] Happy Giraffe: Nylon gears
[2022-12-11T21:19:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Gears have a sounds
[2022-12-11T21:19:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Believe me
[2022-12-11T21:19:30] Happy Giraffe: Yeah but its always tradeoff between torque and speed
[2022-12-11T21:19:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I tried a stock scooter what has it
[2022-12-11T21:19:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You notice noise First
[2022-12-11T21:20:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: True
[2022-12-11T21:20:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also you have better brand motor probably

[2022-12-11T21:35:49] Mirono escooters: The idea of nylon gears is They strip and die before motor burns

[2022-12-11T21:35:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: If don‚Äôt need to save weight , steel is more durable for gears
[2022-12-11T21:35:53] Mirono escooters: So it's a bad fuse

[2022-12-12T17:11:35] Santiago: 20km away from Marbella
[2022-12-12T17:14:34] Face de Pin Suc√©: GTK
[2022-12-12T17:15:52] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: variable voltage & current until 100v 45A (4Kw)
[2022-12-12T17:16:59] Santiago: WATE chargers on ali are also variable voltage but idk about current
[2022-12-12T17:17:44] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: depend the version, but yes this one at beggening it's not connected to the earth but i did it
[2022-12-12T17:17:57] Santiago: Sheesh
[2022-12-12T17:18:30] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: because chinese dont care
[2022-12-12T17:18:50] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it's Telecom PSU modified by them to be ajustable CC/CV
[2022-12-12T17:19:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Did it has precharge circuit?
[2022-12-12T17:19:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: Mine when plug battery then big spark
[2022-12-12T17:20:40] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: no, as all chargers you need to connect the charger to the 230v before plug to the scooter, if not you charge the Caps in the chargers by the battery so = Spark
[2022-12-12T17:21:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: Mine do this even if plugged already in ac 230 line
[2022-12-12T17:21:30] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: when the current is = at the consigne
[2022-12-12T17:21:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because the charger has on/off button .
[2022-12-12T17:21:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: Then it cut directly the line from transformer to dc capacitors
[2022-12-12T17:22:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: So I have always to turn on power before
[2022-12-12T17:23:35] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: when you plug you should have the Delta V of diff√©rential Battery charged and discharged between the both plugs so, if not it's not good
[2022-12-12T17:23:45] Mirono escooters: Mine wasn't connected to earth too and between earth and casinh was 55vac
[2022-12-12T17:23:50] Mirono escooters: Enough to tingle when holding sweaty
[2022-12-12T17:25:04] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Yes i didn't mesure, but i already had small electric shock when i touched them before connect the earth
[2022-12-12T17:25:11] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it's normal
[2022-12-12T17:25:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Do you think an antispark connector will solve this?
[2022-12-12T17:26:01] Mirono escooters: ü§∑ 70‚Ç¨ delivered
[2022-12-12T17:26:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: Maybe qs8 for charging :)
[2022-12-12T17:26:17] Mirono escooters: Works fine tho adjustable is nice, and I'm cheapo dude just need 5a adjustable
[2022-12-12T17:26:18] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Cos-fi = 1, it have PFC actif in the entrance, of course to be 4Kw it's obligation to have good efficiency
[2022-12-12T17:26:46] Santiago: More battery life lol
[2022-12-12T17:27:26] Mirono escooters: Yes alot
[2022-12-12T17:27:34] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Maybe, it's depend why you arc
[2022-12-12T17:28:20] Mirono escooters: Ye
[2022-12-12T17:29:13] Mirono escooters: Yzpower pretty good
[2022-12-12T17:29:46] Santiago: That's why I program the BMS to cut off power at 91%
[2022-12-12T17:30:04] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: if you want it stop the charge before the 4.2 you just have you adjust the charger lower than that
[2022-12-12T17:30:30] Mirono escooters: 4.05+-
[2022-12-12T17:30:42] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: if you want it stop at determined current you can use Laboratory power supplt like mine RD6018 with custom firm
[2022-12-12T17:31:13] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: <photos/photo_7006@12-12-2022_17-31-13.jpg>
[2022-12-12T17:31:29] Mirono escooters: I almost always buy yzpower except when they don't have special like 17s
[2022-12-12T17:31:39] Mirono escooters: I can double check if I have charger left
[2022-12-12T17:31:51] Mirono escooters: 17s is pretty special
[2022-12-12T17:31:57] Mirono escooters: Or it was too expensive I no remember
[2022-12-12T17:32:00] Mirono escooters: Then bought wate
[2022-12-12T17:32:05] Mirono escooters: But ant BMS Bluetooth, balancing top
[2022-12-12T17:41:02] Mirono escooters: True true also
[2022-12-12T17:47:00] Mihail: Disassemble and turn pot or change resistors
[2022-12-12T17:48:00] Mihail: I modded original xiaomi charger to charge 15s
[2022-12-12T17:49:58] Mihail: The charger is just current and voltage limited power supply
[2022-12-12T17:50:10] Mihail: It doesn't have a cut-off
[2022-12-12T17:51:06] Mihail: Exept for thermal(I hope)
[2022-12-12T17:52:14] Mihail: Ive used it at 15s for more than half a year
[2022-12-12T17:52:38] Mihail: It works fine, but heats up a bit more
[2022-12-12T17:54:06] Mihail: It is a good idea to replace output caps, since they are very close to the limit. I haven't replaced them yet and no problems for now, no signs of swelling. But it is advisable
[2022-12-12T17:55:00] Mihail: When it reaches the set voltage, just like any other charger or current-limited power supply
[2022-12-12T17:56:16] Mihail: It works just like the original, but at higher voltage
[2022-12-12T17:57:04] Mihail: It switches
[2022-12-12T17:58:06] Mihail: 4.1v per cell
[2022-12-12T17:58:16] Mihail: 61.5v
[2022-12-12T17:59:33] Mihail: Almost every charger Ive seen has some form of a trim pot inside for adjustment
[2022-12-12T18:00:19] Mihail: No, it sets the output voltage
[2022-12-12T18:00:40] Mihail: Chargers don't cut off when voltage is reached
[2022-12-12T18:01:49] Mihail: ?
[2022-12-12T18:02:40] Mihail: There is no switch, charger is a normal constant-current power supply
[2022-12-12T18:03:14] Mihail: Constant current is supplied to the load(eg. battery)
[2022-12-12T18:04:45] Mihail: Yes

[2022-12-13T01:13:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: To reach speed need torque, but technically with same motor setup and just wider magnet , motor rpm is slower

[2022-12-13T12:08:32] Gordan Gizdic: I havent mentioned. Im running 5.3fw on vesc and the mobile app is 6.0.11
[2022-12-13T12:09:27] Mirono escooters: 5.3 is now outdated since 6 is new
[2022-12-13T12:10:08] Gordan Gizdic: I get that. But, can i flash 6.0 on my Ubox or should i wait?
[2022-12-13T12:10:19] Gordan Gizdic: I dont know if its officially supported?

[2022-12-13T12:30:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: Because I only use electric vesc brake on rear motor for speedway leger
[2022-12-13T12:30:32] Face de Pin Suc√©: Single motor, 10S 2800W is really good enough in town
[2022-12-13T12:30:34] Face de Pin Suc√©: 50Kmh
[2022-12-13T12:30:37] sombre_enfant: Hmu if someday u got suc√© that fit vsett or g30 not too much expensive üò≠
[2022-12-13T12:32:14] Face de Pin Suc√©: If Vsett could fit 11", could have a wonderful motor for you
[2022-12-13T12:37:12] Face de Pin Suc√©: Remember me the opening of the arms ?

[2022-12-13T13:17:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: You will need spacer for arms
[2022-12-13T13:17:38] Face de Pin Suc√©: I sold 2 75H with rims to a guy in USA that has vsett

[2022-12-13T13:57:37] sombre_enfant: Plus telegram bro Mb plus messenger
[2022-12-13T13:59:20] Mirono escooters: I didn't like that telegram
[2022-12-13T13:59:26] Mirono escooters: Still, English group, pls
[2022-12-13T14:00:28] Mirono escooters: Ps, what's the best thermal pad you guys know? Or would I just use kapton?
[2022-12-13T14:00:42] Mirono escooters: Mp2 vesc, 18 mosfets. The heatsink is very flat and milled.
[2022-12-13T14:02:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: Thermal Right
[2022-12-13T14:02:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Alphacool
[2022-12-13T14:02:55] Mirono escooters: No kapton?
[2022-12-13T14:03:05] Mirono escooters: Thought someone said if surface flat af its fine
[2022-12-13T14:03:17] Mirono escooters: It needs to handle shitload of power tho, I need the cooling, small detail
[2022-12-13T14:03:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: I currently use extreme odyssey 12W/mK 1mm thickness
[2022-12-13T14:03:41] Mirono escooters: Thickness, how much it influences transfer?
[2022-12-13T14:04:47] Face de Pin Suc√©: Thicker = bad
[2022-12-13T14:04:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: 0.5mm
[2022-12-13T14:05:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Single tg knows translate now ,but i agree, coz A sokszorosan ford√≠tott mondatok biztosan k√°oszhoz vezetnek, Also fyi If you set translate language to english and type in local language it can do translate for wrighting not just reading
[2022-12-13T14:05:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: Thermal grizzly carbonout should be good, but I think it‚Äôs conductive
[2022-12-13T14:05:34] Mirono escooters: Yes thanks, got that far, but mean how much worse
[2022-12-13T14:05:40] Face de Pin Suc√©: Conductive
[2022-12-13T14:05:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: Don't remember the math
[2022-12-13T14:05:55] Mirono escooters: I'll just spend too much on Amazon for good pad and not blow up mp2
[2022-12-13T14:05:59] Mirono escooters: Hoped kapton would be approved xD
[2022-12-13T14:06:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: The best is kapton, better insulation than thermal pad
[2022-12-13T14:06:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: But not the thick one
[2022-12-13T14:06:33] Mirono escooters: Rlly?
[2022-12-13T14:06:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: More like only isolation
[2022-12-13T14:06:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Xiaomi one is thick and not good
[2022-12-13T14:06:53] Mirono escooters: So I use official kapton, and milled heatsink, not like the Xiaomi one it's casted
[2022-12-13T14:06:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, kapton + paste
[2022-12-13T14:07:01] Mirono escooters: Ok I use that then
[2022-12-13T14:07:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: But surface have to be flat and not bend or casted finish
[2022-12-13T14:07:08] Mirono escooters: Got no thermal paste fmlü•∏
[2022-12-13T14:07:14] Mirono escooters: Milled, flat af
[2022-12-13T14:09:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Or maybe if anyone need I have these
[2022-12-13T14:10:36] Mirono escooters: I have those but I'm super afraid of shifting
[2022-12-13T14:10:49] Mirono escooters: Bcs with Xiaomi even 6 I had sometimes conductivity to the heatsink
[2022-12-13T14:11:10] Mirono escooters: Mp2 impossible to see if they are good, and 18 definitely I fuck up 1
[2022-12-13T14:11:42] Jan: Kapton is 0.12W/mK at 0.03mm. If you add a thin layer of thermal paste, its probably even better than the pads Compared a thermal pad is about 14W/mK at 0.5mm
[2022-12-13T14:12:13] Mirono escooters: 0.12 is low tho? Or I'm misunderstanding
[2022-12-13T14:12:21] Jan: yes but its thin af
[2022-12-13T14:12:39] Mirono escooters: Ok
[2022-12-13T14:12:41] Mirono escooters: I order paste
[2022-12-13T14:13:55] Jan: let me calculate
[2022-12-13T14:14:02] Jan: i check if its feasable
[2022-12-13T14:14:17] Mirono escooters: Xx
[2022-12-13T14:15:03] Jan: ok 1mm pad with 4 W/mK has the same heatflux as kapton 0.03mm at 0.12W /mK
[2022-12-13T14:15:27] Mirono escooters: Soo, order pad or kapton
[2022-12-13T14:15:34] Jan: or 0.5mm at 2W/mK
[2022-12-13T14:15:51] Jan: if you have 0.5mm pad with more than 2W/mK, its better
[2022-12-13T14:15:55] Jan: not worth kapton
[2022-12-13T14:16:03] Mirono escooters: Ok I order
[2022-12-13T14:16:16] Jan: i think best are at 17W/mK or so
[2022-12-13T14:16:30] Mirono escooters: I need best ,ultra oempf
[2022-12-13T14:17:46] Mirono escooters: Saw that
[2022-12-13T14:18:07] Jan: I tried
[2022-12-13T14:18:20] Mirono escooters: https://youtu.be/2BhKx0iQ4K8
[2022-12-13T14:18:47] Jan: If the mosfet touches the heatsink, its a shortcircuit
[2022-12-13T14:19:22] Jan: The metal side of the mosfet is part of its circuit
[2022-12-13T14:19:30] Jan: Its not just a thermal surface
[2022-12-13T14:23:25] Mirono escooters: Masking tape???

[2022-12-16T09:46:10] Mirono escooters: I know kV not t
[2022-12-16T11:07:58] Gigolo Joe: Higher T - more torque less speed Lower T - lower torque, slower acceleration, higher top speed That's the rules of thumb as they say

[2022-12-16T13:08:25] Happy Giraffe: Yep, this given that amps are the same. Lower T motor always capable of same torque (and it will hold the torque for longer after acceleration) but it needs way more power for it

[2022-12-17T18:37:56] Santiago: Shaft is 180mm long
[2022-12-17T18:39:01] Santiago: You might need a bit longer bolts if you want to use the washers between the motor and suspension plate
[2022-12-17T18:41:41] Santiago: Add 8mm to all of them cuz washers are 4mm thick
[2022-12-17T18:43:41] Thierry: I meant fork opening

[2022-12-17T19:09:10] rosheee: XD
[2022-12-17T19:09:44] rosheee: Just use different bracket for caliper adaption instead of these washers/spacers
[2022-12-17T19:09:51] rosheee: Idk why ppl do dis
[2022-12-17T19:13:58] Santiago: I ain't using no washers

[2022-12-17T22:09:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I mean ,this what he does is hard maybe that brake requires it ,but any what has bolt on for oil on caliper is kinda easy,if you
[2022-12-17T22:10:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Put the funnel on the lever top , put the plug in it ,fill nothing in
[2022-12-17T22:11:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Than Remove pads Remove bolt What holds oil in
[2022-12-17T22:11:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Nothing should come out since top is closed
[2022-12-17T22:12:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Than install your syringe full with oil , slowly press and fill up
[2022-12-17T22:12:11] Gordan Gizdic: When you set field weakening. Is 20A of current per motor a lot or is it meh?

[2022-12-17T22:12:36] Gordan Gizdic: Like 5kmh, 10kmh for 20A per motor?
[2022-12-17T22:12:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: When you see funnels tube with new oil ,close it with the plug again ,done

[2022-12-17T22:33:13] rosheee: xD
[2022-12-17T22:33:47] rosheee: when u reach top speed then amps decrease
[2022-12-17T22:33:54] rosheee: and FW gives u nitro then
[2022-12-17T22:33:56] rosheee: so more topspeedf
[2022-12-17T22:34:00] rosheee: 16S -> 100kmh
[2022-12-17T22:35:48] Luis Magalhaes: Without FW?
[2022-12-17T22:38:23] rosheee: with FW
[2022-12-17T22:38:28] rosheee: BUT NOT ANYMORE
[2022-12-17T22:38:30] rosheee: idk whgy
[2022-12-17T22:40:29] Gordan Gizdic: So basically lets say that the 70kmh is top speed with no FW.
[2022-12-17T22:40:45] Gordan Gizdic: Ofc, at 70kmh current drops pff.
[2022-12-17T22:40:49] Luis Magalhaes: Paolo fuckeria motors üòÇ
[2022-12-17T22:41:22] Luis Magalhaes: Yes at the kv limit current drop
[2022-12-17T22:41:38] Gordan Gizdic: I know that.
[2022-12-17T22:41:53] Gordan Gizdic: But FW should than help with that as i read about it.
[2022-12-17T22:42:14] Gordan Gizdic: Basically its weakening the field so that the motor could turn a bit faster.
[2022-12-17T22:42:25] Gordan Gizdic: Not double but some small percentage.
[2022-12-17T22:42:48] Gordan Gizdic: And it depends on how much FW current you allocate for that.
[2022-12-17T22:42:51] Luis Magalhaes: If you use FW should push more amps and should modify timing so it can get more rpm loosing torque and eficiency
[2022-12-17T22:43:38] Gordan Gizdic: Ok, lets say i got 160A total that i can allocate. Theoretically.
[2022-12-17T22:43:53] Luis Magalhaes: Dont know if you use 10A is current+10A of fw or not @roscheeee should know
[2022-12-17T22:44:12] Gordan Gizdic: I can allocate 50x2 to motors in normal running mode and 20A x2 to FW.
[2022-12-17T22:44:20] Luis Magalhaes: I think roshee uses 100A FW if not wrong
[2022-12-17T22:44:29] Gordan Gizdic: Nah.
[2022-12-17T22:44:48] Gordan Gizdic: Said it before. Something like 31/21A on his motors
[2022-12-17T22:45:03] Gordan Gizdic: As in 21A on front and 31A on rear.
[2022-12-17T22:45:03] Luis Magalhaes: Oh ok so my bad üòÇ
[2022-12-17T22:45:19] Gordan Gizdic: Roscheeee.. cmon mate.
[2022-12-17T22:45:23] Luis Magalhaes: Ok so it is current+FW set
[2022-12-17T22:45:42] Gordan Gizdic: Yup..
[2022-12-17T22:46:06] Gordan Gizdic: But, if current falls down at top speed, than can i actually set FW currents higher?
[2022-12-17T22:46:15] Gordan Gizdic: And how much can be gained.
[2022-12-17T22:46:27] Luis Magalhaes: If you have 160A , 100A normal +40A FW should do 140A max current is this?
[2022-12-17T22:46:34] Gordan Gizdic: Those are the thoughts that are going through ƒëy head.
[2022-12-17T22:46:45] Gordan Gizdic: In theory, yes.
[2022-12-17T22:47:01] rosheee: what?
[2022-12-17T22:47:10] Gordan Gizdic: Lol

[2022-12-17T22:47:26] Luis Magalhaes: On 16S g30 how much FW you tested?
[2022-12-17T22:47:39] Gordan Gizdic: And how much you have gained?
[2022-12-17T22:51:18] Luis Magalhaes: If you send him nudes he answer fasterüòÇ
[2022-12-17T22:52:01] Gordan Gizdic: There

[2022-12-17T22:56:46] Gordan Gizdic: And stock speed vs speed with FW was?
[2022-12-17T22:56:51] Gordan Gizdic: How much you gained?

[2022-12-18T22:33:06] Gordan Gizdic: Idk, just an idea?
[2022-12-18T22:33:12] Gordan Gizdic: Cheap, 20min job.
[2022-12-18T22:33:19] Gordan Gizdic: Works awesome.
[2022-12-18T23:42:05] Jan: Do double height battery with 80mm spacer upwards
[2022-12-18T23:42:10] Mirono escooters: <video_file>
[2022-12-18T23:43:00] Jan: There is no need in bringing the handlebars down if you move the deck up lol
[2022-12-18T23:43:36] Luis Magalhaes: Foc or bldc?
[2022-12-18T23:43:46] Mirono escooters: Foc
[2022-12-18T23:43:47] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2022-12-18T23:43:55] Luis Magalhaes: <animation>
[2022-12-18T23:46:22] Mirono escooters: Yessir
[2022-12-18T23:46:24] Mirono escooters: 5h later
[2022-12-18T23:46:30] Mirono escooters: Was a badly soldered mosfet leg bcs pad broke

[2022-12-18T23:50:16] Jan: If you want it more stable, you could replace swingarms with longer ones?
[2022-12-18T23:51:00] Jan: I mean, imagine a 1meter long swing arm. How would that wobble? You could not even turn it anymore left right.
[2022-12-18T23:51:26] Jan: So just making it a little longer could massively help stability
[2022-12-19T00:10:32] Jan: There are at least two thing contributing. Steering angle and trail. I know what you are thinking with the trolley wheel. If you look at bikes, its inversed
[2022-12-19T00:11:28] Jan: <photos/photo_7062@19-12-2022_00-11-28.jpg>
[2022-12-19T00:12:24] Mirono escooters: Higher trail, better?
[2022-12-19T00:12:27] Jan: More positive trail would make it more stable according to many pages
[2022-12-19T00:12:28] Mirono escooters: My bike has quite a trail
[2022-12-19T00:12:50] Jan: So how to make max trail on a scooter
[2022-12-19T00:12:51] Mirono escooters: And is very, very stable
[2022-12-19T00:13:13] Jan: Except steering angle i dont know what
[2022-12-19T00:13:18] Mirono escooters: That's a mechanical challenge
[2022-12-19T00:13:55] Jan: With offsetting the wheel, you introduce a "fake" steering angle to it that is flatter?
[2022-12-19T00:14:36] Jan: To be honest, i dont know the results at all, would be nice to see
[2022-12-19T00:15:10] Mirono escooters: If it gets translated into suspension, yes. Otherwise kinda worthless except angle for bumbs
[2022-12-19T00:16:19] Jan: A one meter swing arm cannot wobble, because its so much in the front that you cant turn thr wheel anymore
[2022-12-19T00:16:47] Jan: Thats my assumption. (Assume an extreme and see if it would be in the right direction) ü§∑
[2022-12-19T00:17:20] Jan: I mean the worst would than be the wheel directly on the axis
[2022-12-19T00:17:28] Mirono escooters: We should draw it in SolidWorks and try, but who has such time
[2022-12-19T02:20:01] Unknown: Then the scooter would articulate like a front end loader. And the "hinge" point would want to fall.

[2022-12-19T10:56:18] Mehmet √ñz: <photos/photo_7063@19-12-2022_10-56-18.jpg>
[2022-12-19T10:56:56] Mehmet √ñz: <photos/photo_7064@19-12-2022_10-56-56.jpg>
[2022-12-19T11:00:53] Mirono escooters: Yes but why not update
[2022-12-19T11:01:45] Mirono escooters: Makerx died. Water damage. Time for mp2
[2022-12-19T11:02:02] Mehmet √ñz: i found this from outside
[2022-12-19T11:02:57] Mehmet √ñz: what mp2 ?
[2022-12-19T11:05:01] Mirono escooters: Controller
[2022-12-19T11:05:58] Mehmet √ñz: alternatif to vesc ?
[2022-12-19T11:07:38] Mirono escooters: Is vesc
[2022-12-19T11:08:39] Mehmet √ñz: this bluetooth modul with Flipsky 75100 5.3 firmware ,with 3.0 apk , can I use?
[2022-12-19T11:08:57] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2022-12-19T11:09:05] Mehmet √ñz: thank
[2022-12-19T11:09:19] Mehmet √ñz: 3.3 or 5v ?
[2022-12-19T11:09:34] Mirono escooters: I think 5 check it
[2022-12-19T11:09:48] Mehmet √ñz: ok
[2022-12-19T11:09:53] Gordan Gizdic: For what? Adc?
[2022-12-19T11:09:58] Gordan Gizdic: Or hall?
[2022-12-19T11:10:08] Gordan Gizdic: Usually its 5V
[2022-12-19T11:10:13] Gordan Gizdic: Some use 3.3V
[2022-12-19T11:10:17] Gordan Gizdic: Depends.
[2022-12-19T11:10:54] Mehmet √ñz: can i use uart 2 is 3.3v
[2022-12-19T11:12:15] Mehmet √ñz: use can uart2
[2022-12-19T11:18:35] Gordan Gizdic: Throttle is usually 5V
[2022-12-19T11:18:47] Mehmet √ñz: ok
[2022-12-19T11:18:52] Gordan Gizdic: Which scoot do you have?
[2022-12-19T11:19:01] Gordan Gizdic: Mate, you need to know the specs.
[2022-12-19T11:19:06] Mehmet √ñz: also ,rx -rx ,tx-tx connect ?
[2022-12-19T11:19:08] Gordan Gizdic: This is just a guessing game.
[2022-12-19T11:20:29] Mehmet √ñz: said 5v
[2022-12-19T11:22:24] Gordan Gizdic: Bt is working on 5V
[2022-12-19T11:22:40] Gordan Gizdic: Also, throttle usually works also on 5V but not all of them.
[2022-12-19T11:22:42] Mehmet √ñz: ok,thank
[2022-12-19T11:23:04] Gordan Gizdic: Adc is throttle signal.
[2022-12-19T11:23:25] Gordan Gizdic: Thats why i said you need to know the specs of your throttle.
[2022-12-19T11:24:02] Mehmet √ñz: i said bluetooth modul
[2022-12-19T11:24:52] Mehmet √ñz: i am talking about bluetooth module
[2022-12-19T11:25:55] Gordan Gizdic: BT needs 5V
[2022-12-19T11:26:45] Mehmet √ñz: 1 - 5v or 3.3v , 2- uart 2 is it use ,3- rx-rx or rx-tx connect
[2022-12-19T11:26:58] Mehmet √ñz: ok thank
[2022-12-19T11:29:20] Mehmet √ñz: <photos/photo_7067@19-12-2022_11-29-20.jpg>
[2022-12-19T11:29:30] Mehmet √ñz: I cut the comm socket, so can I use uart2?
[2022-12-19T11:31:01] Gordan Gizdic: Im not sure. Dont have schematics.
[2022-12-19T11:32:24] Mehmet √ñz: this cable shema
[2022-12-19T11:32:58] Gordan Gizdic: Wait.
[2022-12-19T11:33:04] Gordan Gizdic: Let me double check.
[2022-12-19T11:33:19] Mehmet √ñz: uart2 is 3.3v ,i think this is the problem
[2022-12-19T11:34:03] Gordan Gizdic: Ok, so BT needs 5V, i checked.
[2022-12-19T11:34:43] Gordan Gizdic: You can use power and ground from comm port but tx/rx from uart port.
[2022-12-19T11:35:02] Mehmet √ñz: can i use 5v on servo connector
[2022-12-19T11:35:23] Gordan Gizdic: Not sure that 5V on servo is available all the time.
[2022-12-19T11:35:47] Gordan Gizdic: 5v on comm is always available.
[2022-12-19T11:36:04] Mehmet √ñz: ok
[2022-12-19T11:42:53] Mehmet √ñz: Can I use the 5v on comm by moving it to uart2?
[2022-12-19T11:43:56] Gordan Gizdic: You could as long as you dont touch that 3.3v pin.
[2022-12-19T11:44:37] Gordan Gizdic: But, as rule of thum. Its also better to use gnd from the same place from where you are taking the power.
[2022-12-19T11:44:46] Gordan Gizdic: Its so you dont mess the ground loops.
[2022-12-19T11:44:54] Gordan Gizdic: That can be sometimes tricky.
[2022-12-19T11:45:12] Gordan Gizdic: I would rather take 5V and gnd from same connector.
[2022-12-19T11:46:02] Mehmet √ñz: ok thank
[2022-12-19T11:46:33] Mehmet √ñz: it will be some work for me
[2022-12-19T11:47:12] Gordan Gizdic: Take it easy and all will be fine.

[2022-12-19T13:12:54] Mehmet √ñz: does it have anything to do with it?
[2022-12-19T13:13:46] Mehmet √ñz: 6.0 is beta ?
[2022-12-19T13:13:52] Gordan Gizdic: It could cause problems with lost connection.
[2022-12-19T13:14:00] Gordan Gizdic: Tx is weaker.
[2022-12-19T13:14:11] Gordan Gizdic: 6.0 is not beta anymore afaik.

[2022-12-19T17:44:39] Mirono escooters: Best suspension
[2022-12-19T17:47:00] Jan: Steering geometry
[2022-12-19T17:49:00] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Trail aka steering geometry is the best out of all
[2022-12-19T17:49:47] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Gt frame more stable but a little harder to turn fast on slow speed. Like cruiser or chopper from motorcycle world

[2022-12-20T18:16:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: How possible
[2022-12-20T18:16:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: With small motor is easy
[2022-12-20T18:16:35] Mirono escooters: Must b factory defect
[2022-12-20T18:16:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: But when the Kv is pretty high, not everything is good
[2022-12-20T18:16:46] Mirono escooters: Rofl 5000w is small
[2022-12-20T18:16:50] Mirono escooters: :)

[2022-12-22T12:32:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: which vescs ? 1 dual vesc or 2 single with can bus cable ?
[2022-12-22T12:34:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: on ubox dual, you have a number of power button presses to do to link both stm32 by internal can. 220ohm isn't gonna work. you either disabled can link, either fried can bus latch or transcievers
[2022-12-22T12:36:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: Don‚Äôt like? üôÅ
[2022-12-22T12:44:04] Gordan Gizdic: Stupid but try to disconnect battery for at least an hour.
[2022-12-22T12:44:22] Gordan Gizdic: Just so that all the charge is removed from the board.
[2022-12-22T12:44:28] Gordan Gizdic: Sometimes it helps.
[2022-12-22T12:44:45] Gordan Gizdic: Also, vibrations could have caused a loose connection.
[2022-12-22T12:45:05] Gordan Gizdic: Maybe blow it with hot air soldering station?
[2022-12-22T12:51:13] Gordan Gizdic: 6.0fw?
[2022-12-22T12:51:19] Gordan Gizdic: Maybe a hidden bug?
[2022-12-22T12:51:23] Gordan Gizdic: Fw issue?
[2022-12-22T12:53:04] Gordan Gizdic: I know, i would rip everything put.
[2022-12-22T12:53:07] Gordan Gizdic: Out*
[2022-12-22T12:54:08] Gordan Gizdic: Keep us updated if you find out whats the issue.
[2022-12-22T12:54:15] Gordan Gizdic: Also..
[2022-12-22T12:54:20] Gordan Gizdic: I remembered something.
[2022-12-22T12:54:54] Gordan Gizdic: Spintend has a tutorial on their blog about disconnecting escs while doing throttle setup.
[2022-12-22T12:55:06] Gordan Gizdic: Something about overload on can bus.
[2022-12-22T12:55:12] Gordan Gizdic: Maybe check it out?
[2022-12-22T12:55:47] Gordan Gizdic: Give me a minute
[2022-12-22T12:55:52] Gordan Gizdic: Ill try to find it.
[2022-12-22T12:58:34] Gordan Gizdic: http://175.178.7.90/index.php?title=Adapter_V2_manual#Setup_in_VESC_tool
[2022-12-22T12:58:52] Gordan Gizdic: 8 Setup in VESC tool
[2022-12-22T12:59:05] Gordan Gizdic: http://175.178.7.90/index.php?title=Adapter_V2_manual#Setup_in_VESC_tool
[2022-12-22T12:59:08] Gordan Gizdic: There.
[2022-12-22T12:59:46] Gordan Gizdic: So basically you disconnect both escs, do throttle setup on esca, then re enable can so it copies the signal to escb.
[2022-12-22T12:59:56] Gordan Gizdic: I managed to do it like this easily.
[2022-12-22T13:14:05] Gordan Gizdic: Reverse logic and voila. Should work.
[2022-12-22T13:14:26] Gordan Gizdic: Im plugged direct into BT port on escb.
[2022-12-22T13:14:40] Gordan Gizdic: I mean the dedicated port for BT
[2022-12-22T13:15:00] Gordan Gizdic: Yeah, have no experience at all with single.
[2022-12-22T13:15:39] Gordan Gizdic: Could be this issue than.
[2022-12-22T13:15:42] Gordan Gizdic: Give it a try.
[2022-12-22T13:16:27] Gordan Gizdic: I dug a lot before even attempting to connect anything and i remember this specifically.
[2022-12-22T13:16:52] Gordan Gizdic: It takes 5s to di it.
[2022-12-22T13:17:01] Gordan Gizdic: Reflash... Well, its complicated
[2022-12-22T14:58:19] francois schempers: hi guys, im buing √† ninebot d38E for my Sister, you you know if I can unlock the speed on those one ?
[2022-12-22T14:59:27] Mirono escooters: >:( go vesc
[2022-12-22T15:00:29] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ask Oleg from xiaodash
[2022-12-22T15:02:24] francois schempers: yeah well if I can not put 300‚Ç¨ on top of the price that would be great xD
[2022-12-22T15:02:31] francois schempers: okey
[2022-12-22T15:04:02] Mirono escooters: Boring
[2022-12-22T15:06:57] francois schempers: ahah x) if I went that way I would just buy a frame and make it myself, she is just not worth the effort, she doesn't want more speed and she want all the things to work (screen, light, etc) so I'll just get a good scooter and unlock it ^^
[2022-12-22T15:07:33] Mirono escooters: Ninebot max go brr
[2022-12-22T15:22:55] S1m 0n: what kind of cable do you use if you want to extend the cable of your motor? Cables like the battery or are they special?
[2022-12-22T15:23:55] Mirono escooters: Nothing special
[2022-12-22T15:24:06] Mirono escooters: Cable is cable lol
[2022-12-22T15:25:20] S1m 0n: yes but most motor cables are rigid while battery cables are flexible. Motor cables have fewer but thicker cores, that's why I'm asking
[2022-12-22T15:25:54] Mirono escooters: Non
[2022-12-22T15:25:54] Mirono escooters: Silicon vs normal cable
[2022-12-22T15:27:47] S1m 0n: I would like to make an adapter cable between the controller and the motor, because the cable from the motor is otherwise glued to seal the battery compartment. so i can just use solid copper wires for the short piece without loss or risk?
[2022-12-22T15:28:09] Mirono escooters: Solid cable?
[2022-12-22T15:28:13] Mirono escooters: If it doesn't get moved or bend ok
[2022-12-22T15:29:17] S1m 0n: Nice üôÇ

[2022-12-22T23:36:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: With vesc is possible 120kmh
[2022-12-22T23:36:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt know if wolf battery will be good with the current
[2022-12-22T23:38:20] rosheee: I had bit more than 115kmh with stock battery and motors
[2022-12-22T23:38:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: With fw?

[2022-12-22T23:52:36] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-12-22T23:52:41] rosheee: Now paolo has it
[2022-12-23T00:52:04] Kris: Very nice setup,what vesc is that? Regen? Temperatures(with that heatsink)? Well so far I have to admit,not really impressed by suspension and brakes as I thought I would be. I guess maybe getting used to it is the thing, I will give it a month to get used to. The laotie ti30 I drove so far on 60V with 2 flipsky 75100 feels better ( although it squeeks and makes all sorts of noises) and more safe for riding (has 700 something mm handlebar) but only pulls 120A out of battery 60A each vesc on stock firmware still didn't try no limit yet, I bought 200 molicell p42a cells for 72v but need to make new frame to fit that into it as I don't want to make battery without cell holders in it...
[2022-12-23T00:53:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: <video_file>
[2022-12-23T01:01:28] Kris: That thing has temp sensors in the motors or?
[2022-12-23T01:01:43] rosheee: no
[2022-12-23T01:01:46] rosheee: stock motors
[2022-12-23T01:01:52] rosheee: it is exactly that scooter
[2022-12-23T01:04:13] rosheee: which?
[2022-12-23T01:06:15] Kris: The one in videos I guess while you still had it
[2022-12-23T01:07:06] Kris: Did you finish it or still work in progress?
[2022-12-23T01:09:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Tomorrow finish
[2022-12-23T01:09:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: I hope
[2022-12-23T01:09:35] rosheee: Yes First ubox 100v Then tronic Then tronic burned Then kelly Never tested Not even 100km Then gave it paolo
[2022-12-23T01:22:28] Gordan Gizdic: Ubox v2, 75/100. Is this thing 100A of battery per ESC or is it total of 100A input?
[2022-12-23T01:22:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: <video_file>
[2022-12-23T01:22:45] Gordan Gizdic: Cant find spec.
[2022-12-23T01:22:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: Will you try this @S1m0n_420 ?
[2022-12-23T01:24:44] Luis Magalhaes: Per esc
[2022-12-23T01:25:03] Luis Magalhaes: 100x2
[2022-12-23T01:25:05] Gordan Gizdic: Why does it come with 120A fuse on the input? Fml...
[2022-12-23T01:25:26] Gordan Gizdic: Also, wires... Dont seem they can take 200A.
[2022-12-23T01:25:40] Luis Magalhaes: Dont know mine did not came with fuse üòÇ
[2022-12-23T01:25:47] Luis Magalhaes: Its new that thing
[2022-12-23T01:26:03] Gordan Gizdic: That fuse looks like cambodian kids soldered it.
[2022-12-23T01:26:11] rosheee: never used fuse
[2022-12-23T01:26:11] Gordan Gizdic: No offence to cambodia.
[2022-12-23T01:26:22] rosheee: but 75V ubox can do 200A peak no prob
[2022-12-23T01:26:24] Luis Magalhaes: The max i push was 70x2 in my wolf dont had battery for more
[2022-12-23T01:26:35] Gordan Gizdic: Im not using it also, looked sketcy.
[2022-12-23T01:26:49] Gordan Gizdic: But i do have fuses on batt packs.
[2022-12-23T01:27:01] Gordan Gizdic: Dont wanna run anything that does not have a fuse.
[2022-12-23T01:27:02] rosheee: dream was to put in both 20S6P batteries and just ride it for like 5km üòÜ
[2022-12-23T01:27:07] rosheee: 1 battery per motor

[2022-12-23T01:27:32] Luis Magalhaes: Was the red one 75v
[2022-12-23T01:27:51] Luis Magalhaes: Still have it but need to change one stm32
[2022-12-23T01:36:21] rosheee: yes

[2022-12-23T01:45:36] Gordan Gizdic: In the long run should heat up a lot.
[2022-12-23T01:45:47] Gordan Gizdic: But theory and practice... Often enemies.

[2022-12-23T02:59:34] Gordan Gizdic: I see that. üòÇ
[2022-12-23T02:59:54] Gordan Gizdic: Youre young?
[2022-12-23T03:00:04] Gordan Gizdic: I used to stay up all night.
[2022-12-23T03:00:09] Gordan Gizdic: Now, no efing way.
[2022-12-23T03:00:12] Gordan Gizdic: It kills me.
[2022-12-23T03:00:35] Gordan Gizdic: Yeah, up untill 32/33 i could do it easy. Not so much now.
[2022-12-23T03:00:57] Gordan Gizdic: If i dont get proper sleep, im a zombie next day.
[2022-12-23T03:02:24] Gordan Gizdic: I touch the bed, instasleep.
[2022-12-23T03:02:56] Gordan Gizdic: Dont
[2022-12-23T03:03:00] Gordan Gizdic: Do not mention food.
[2022-12-23T03:03:05] Gordan Gizdic: Nope.
[2022-12-23T03:03:09] Gordan Gizdic: Fuck wirh that.
[2022-12-23T03:03:30] Gordan Gizdic: I might be. A little. Idk. I could eat. üòÇ
[2022-12-23T03:04:33] Gordan Gizdic: Nah.
[2022-12-23T03:04:35] Gordan Gizdic: By by.
[2022-12-23T03:04:42] Gordan Gizdic: No eating at this time.
[2022-12-23T03:04:46] Gordan Gizdic: Fuck nah.
[2022-12-23T03:05:02] Gordan Gizdic: Yeah.. nah.
[2022-12-23T03:05:25] Gordan Gizdic: Otherwise, toliet is all mine in the morning. All mine and only mine.
[2022-12-23T03:05:29] Gordan Gizdic: Thats not good.
[2022-12-23T03:09:55] Gordan Gizdic: Nah. Kid is sick, im sick. No sleeping yet
[2022-12-23T03:10:14] Gordan Gizdic: At least untill the medicine does its thing.
[2022-12-23T03:12:28] Gordan Gizdic: I dont get it. Youre not tired?
[2022-12-23T03:12:44] Gordan Gizdic: Go count sheeps.
[2022-12-23T03:12:53] Gordan Gizdic: I used to do it.
[2022-12-23T03:13:37] Gordan Gizdic: I slept through 6.2 earthquake.
[2022-12-23T03:13:54] Gordan Gizdic: If wifey didnt come screaming, i wouldnt know untill morning.
[2022-12-23T03:14:18] Gordan Gizdic: But, if kid cries for 0.5s. im up and running.
[2022-12-23T03:14:26] rosheee: omg
[2022-12-23T03:14:26] Gordan Gizdic: Idk, brain is a weird thing.
[2022-12-23T03:14:31] rosheee: word
[2022-12-23T03:15:07] rosheee: tomorrow brunch omg
[2022-12-23T03:15:13] rosheee: gonna fix printer until 5 ^^'
[2022-12-23T03:15:16] Gordan Gizdic: Lol, that can be nice. Gives you time to do something usefull.
[2022-12-23T03:15:24] Gordan Gizdic: Im always struggling for time.
[2022-12-23T03:15:39] rosheee: nope
[2022-12-23T03:16:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Like meüòÇ
[2022-12-23T03:16:01] rosheee: oh yes
[2022-12-23T03:16:13] rosheee: shit doesn't help after 3 days
[2022-12-23T03:16:15] rosheee: even 100mg
[2022-12-23T03:16:22] rosheee: then u take zolpidem
[2022-12-23T03:16:23] Gordan Gizdic: Oh my god.
[2022-12-23T03:16:30] rosheee: doesn't work after 3-4days as well
[2022-12-23T03:16:34] Gordan Gizdic: Wtf with this generation?
[2022-12-23T03:16:36] rosheee: even when take 2-3
[2022-12-23T03:16:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: 10mg is good
[2022-12-23T03:16:47] rosheee: 10mg never helped me üò¢
[2022-12-23T03:16:51] Gordan Gizdic: Go run, warm shower, eat something and to bed.
[2022-12-23T03:17:03] rosheee: did now me fat üòÜ
[2022-12-23T03:17:21] rosheee: in my darkest days years ago ^^'
[2022-12-23T03:17:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: Try with a glass of wine, will do effect faster
[2022-12-23T03:17:35] rosheee: 1 month i had pretty hard shit 2 do and couldn't sleep omg
[2022-12-23T03:17:50] rosheee: then drank 1 bottle whisky every evening lol
[2022-12-23T03:17:53] rosheee: worst
[2022-12-23T03:17:58] Gordan Gizdic: Jizs
[2022-12-23T03:18:05] rosheee: yah but just for 25days
[2022-12-23T03:18:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: You have to take 3/4 hour before, with wine 1/2hour works
[2022-12-23T03:18:23] Gordan Gizdic: We used to mix praxiten and alcohol. Its able to knock down a horse.
[2022-12-23T03:18:52] rosheee: benzos are hell ^^'
[2022-12-23T03:18:54] rosheee: holy crap xD
[2022-12-23T03:19:16] Gordan Gizdic: Not knock down, you would wake up somewhere. God knows where. Just never where you wanted to.
[2022-12-23T03:19:51] rosheee: lol
[2022-12-23T03:19:53] Gordan Gizdic: https://www.centarzdravlja.hr/proizvodi-za-zdravlje/lijekovi-na-recept/praxiten-tablete/
[2022-12-23T03:19:55] rosheee: oxazepam xD
[2022-12-23T03:20:01] Gordan Gizdic: Idk, some shit to make you calm.
[2022-12-23T03:20:01] rosheee: worst
[2022-12-23T03:20:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: This one 100% works
[2022-12-23T03:20:22] Gordan Gizdic: But when mixed with alcohol, it sedates you in 20min.
[2022-12-23T03:20:39] Gordan Gizdic: Idk, could be. But it works a charm.
[2022-12-23T03:20:43] rosheee: oxazepam ^'^aiai
[2022-12-23T03:20:55] rosheee: WORST
[2022-12-23T03:20:57] Gordan Gizdic: Young, stupid. Yeah.
[2022-12-23T03:21:09] rosheee: i faked prescription in asia ^^'
[2022-12-23T03:21:12] rosheee: then went to doctor and ^^'...
[2022-12-23T03:21:21] rosheee: we took what we found on internet
[2022-12-23T03:21:22] Gordan Gizdic: Well, we did go through war time here than. Anything was attainable.
[2022-12-23T03:21:24] rosheee: and was available
[2022-12-23T03:21:41] rosheee: yes
[2022-12-23T03:21:43] rosheee: it was swiss one
[2022-12-23T03:21:45] rosheee: it was legit
[2022-12-23T03:21:50] rosheee: we just chagned name in pdf ^^
[2022-12-23T03:22:05] rosheee: then went to different hospitals everyday
[2022-12-23T03:22:11] rosheee: always said "need 1 month supply"
[2022-12-23T03:22:14] rosheee: of like 2-3 different ^^'
[2022-12-23T03:22:22] rosheee: but we checked that they "harmonize" with each other
[2022-12-23T03:22:22] rosheee: lol
[2022-12-23T03:22:25] rosheee: yes
[2022-12-23T03:22:32] rosheee: XD EVERYTHING
[2022-12-23T03:22:58] rosheee: nah roche doesn't
[2022-12-23T03:23:02] rosheee: but taiwanese have good
[2022-12-23T03:23:25] rosheee: awit
[2022-12-23T03:23:29] rosheee: maybe i find
[2022-12-23T03:24:53] Gordan Gizdic: Guys, take care of youselves. Kid is off to bed, im gonna go die in bed. üòÇ
[2022-12-23T03:29:04] rosheee: sleep well
[2022-12-23T03:29:07] rosheee: get well soon
[2022-12-23T06:58:40] S1m 0n: It's not s problem üòä... High Amps but low Voltage(or the impulse current has a very high voltage but almost no amperes) .not directly on the nipple but otherwise that's no problem. has happened to me many times too
[2022-12-23T11:31:31] S1m 0n: are ceramic ball bearings worthwhile instead of metal ball bearings? in terms of maintenance and durability?
[2022-12-23T11:31:56] rosheee: never tested but y not
[2022-12-23T11:32:29] S1m 0n: never tested either, but they sound interesting to me
[2022-12-23T11:32:38] rosheee: word but which one ^^?
[2022-12-23T11:54:46] S1m 0n: right there is the catch. when you just google it, the selection seems pretty small
[2022-12-23T11:57:27] rosheee: There is 1 in the states
[2022-12-23T11:57:33] rosheee: 4 pcs 100$
[2022-12-23T11:57:34] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-12-23T11:58:18] rosheee: They can run crysis
[2022-12-23T12:02:02] S1m 0n: Same in Germany (Brand "Sturm) and Ali Express
[2022-12-23T12:19:18] Gordan Gizdic: Not worth it.
[2022-12-23T12:19:34] Gordan Gizdic: When i used to to speedruns with RCs i had them on my cars.
[2022-12-23T12:20:00] Gordan Gizdic: Yes, they are fast, gave us 5-7 kmh top speed which is a LOT when you get over 240kmh.
[2022-12-23T12:20:13] Gordan Gizdic: But they are terrible for maintainance.
[2022-12-23T12:20:56] Gordan Gizdic: Sand and small particles get in over time and they shred them reducing their the small balls diameter and after a while it starts knocking.
[2022-12-23T12:21:12] Gordan Gizdic: Expensive, not worth it in the long run.
[2022-12-23T12:21:48] Gordan Gizdic: If you want to push 2-3kmh more, maybe but overall not yet fully mature tech.
[2022-12-23T12:23:11] Gordan Gizdic: https://youtu.be/8kBJGPN4neU
[2022-12-23T12:23:41] Gordan Gizdic: 224kmh warm up pass. 267 full run. 12.6hp in a small rc thats 5kg.
[2022-12-23T12:24:03] Gordan Gizdic: 8s system, 400A peak.
[2022-12-23T12:24:40] S1m 0n: thank you for your experiences üëç Gordan
[2022-12-23T12:33:11] rosheee: ^^ i had better speeds with the skf 2cz than the rsr
[2022-12-23T12:33:27] rosheee: idk if it is cuz zhe bearings that i have that less topspeed üòÜ
[2022-12-23T12:41:39] rosheee: gonna change bearings next time when new tires
[2022-12-23T13:27:55] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_7117@23-12-2022_13-27-55.jpg>
[2022-12-23T13:27:57] Mirono escooters: Cant be stable
[2022-12-23T13:31:29] Konstantin: Fw version? Phase filters was disabled?
[2022-12-23T13:31:43] Mirono escooters: It dont habe phase filters?
[2022-12-23T13:32:28] Konstantin: I don't know...just + 1way...what happens...and why...
[2022-12-23T13:33:45] Kris: Yes very shitty scooter have one at home,need to get rid of it battery shit suspension even worse but power ok but it doesn't mean a thing if you can't control it
[2022-12-23T13:34:23] Konstantin: <photos/photo_7118@23-12-2022_13-34-23.jpg>
[2022-12-23T13:35:49] Jan: As long as it is not moving it is stable üòÖ
[2022-12-23T13:40:46] S1m 0n: I have my ball bearing last weekend replaced by SKF 2RSH... 10500km the old SKF, Scooter stands 24/7 365days a year outside. I had not noticed that die old were badüòÇ If I now with the new SKF let go of the throttle, you have again the feeling as if you would still give gas, so smoothly rolls the scooter further
[2022-12-23T13:51:19] Miklos Szilveszter: Az igen
[2022-12-23T14:32:55] Gordan Gizdic: 68kmh GPS top speed with vesc.
[2022-12-23T14:33:01] Gordan Gizdic: Seems kinda sketchy.
[2022-12-23T14:33:22] Gordan Gizdic: I used to get 71-73kmh with stock controller on my vsett 10+
[2022-12-23T14:33:26] Gordan Gizdic: <video_file>
[2022-12-23T14:33:39] Gordan Gizdic: All speed measurements are verified with GPS
[2022-12-23T14:34:17] Gordan Gizdic: Could it be that the stock controller runs much more FW current than i am currently with my Ubox V2 75/100 dual.
[2022-12-23T14:35:05] Gordan Gizdic: I mean, accel cant be compared, ubox is way more powerfull. Im just wondering is it possible thar stock controller pushes a lot more current into FW?
[2022-12-23T14:35:26] Gordan Gizdic: Im running 10A per esc now on FW.
[2022-12-23T14:36:03] Gordan Gizdic: Not much, i know but i kinda dont want to go over with the FW current.
[2022-12-23T14:37:06] Gordan Gizdic: But looking at the input current at top speed. I could easily oush more FW current.
[2022-12-23T14:37:23] Gordan Gizdic: Idk, just some thoughts i wanted to share. üòÇ
[2022-12-23T14:40:38] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: No, stock controllers are bldc
[2022-12-23T14:40:44] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Vesc you used foc?
[2022-12-23T14:40:52] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: it is your duty cycle %
[2022-12-23T14:40:55] Gordan Gizdic: Yup, foc
[2022-12-23T14:40:56] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: check it
[2022-12-23T14:41:13] Gordan Gizdic: Didnt get this
[2022-12-23T14:41:26] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Duty cycle number in vesc tool
[2022-12-23T14:41:41] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: if it is 96% then ofc its slower
[2022-12-23T14:41:48] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: set 99%
[2022-12-23T14:41:56] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: will be another 2-3 kmh
[2022-12-23T14:42:18] Gordan Gizdic: Ill check it.
[2022-12-23T14:42:21] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Duty cycle% aka " max rpms"
[2022-12-23T14:42:35] Gordan Gizdic: Where do i check that?
[2022-12-23T14:42:49] Gordan Gizdic: Motor config?
[2022-12-23T14:43:14] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: ye > advanced
[2022-12-23T14:43:21] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: maximum duty cycle
[2022-12-23T14:43:53] Gordan Gizdic: Great, ill check it. Thnx.
[2022-12-23T14:44:19] Gordan Gizdic: Also, current displayed is phase current. Not batt current. Right?
[2022-12-23T14:45:05] Gordan Gizdic: My mottor is better safe than sorry.
[2022-12-23T14:45:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: on rt data current is phase yes. Battery is showed on the first tab
[2022-12-23T14:45:16] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: parameter Ibatt
[2022-12-23T14:45:20] Gordan Gizdic: I do feel that the system is capable of more.
[2022-12-23T14:45:36] Gordan Gizdic: Im just taking my time to get to know the system.
[2022-12-23T14:45:43] Gordan Gizdic: Where its limits are.
[2022-12-23T14:45:57] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Battery currents?
[2022-12-23T14:46:59] Gordan Gizdic: Nah, i meant im not pushing anything hard for now. Im just testing to see where the limits are.
[2022-12-23T14:47:06] Gordan Gizdic: Slowly, step by step.
[2022-12-23T14:59:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, I'm sure they push more Field Weakening than 10A in stock vsett controllers
[2022-12-23T15:00:33] Gordan Gizdic: Thnx mate, i thought so.
[2022-12-23T15:00:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: But also, set your duty to 99% as advised :)
[2022-12-23T15:01:04] S1m 0n: Vsett itself use Foc?
[2022-12-23T15:01:19] Gordan Gizdic: Nope. Stock is bldc.
[2022-12-23T15:03:54] S1m 0n: Sometimes I think Kaabo uses foc. When I press the throttle almost completely, the engine surrs like any other. But when you push the throttle all the way, the buzz and vibration of the engine changes.
[2022-12-23T15:04:58] S1m 0n: I know the chipset of the controller can not foc (at least that I have read several times that the calculating power is not enough)
[2022-12-23T15:06:43] S1m 0n: Does anyone know what exactly is the advantage/disadvantage of U/V/W and U/V/SVM ?
[2022-12-23T15:07:27] S1m 0n: From the detection of Hall sensors?
[2022-12-23T16:19:48] rosheee: <photos/photo_7119@23-12-2022_16-19-48.jpg>

[2022-12-23T16:53:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: Anyone from Europe have some nice project for sell?
[2022-12-23T16:53:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: what does it mean .
[2022-12-23T16:53:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: ?
[2022-12-23T17:27:17] Luis Magalhaes: Want a wolf? üòÇüòÇ
[2022-12-23T17:28:08] Mirono escooters: XD I got ninebot frame and Xiaomi classic with dual motors and suspension, idk what u looking for?
[2022-12-23T17:28:54] Luis Magalhaes: @SibClimb what could cause a motor to get hot? It looks like working normal but when i hit a bump it gives me an error "reset error" but works anyway
[2022-12-23T17:29:13] Mirono escooters: Loose temp sensor?
[2022-12-23T17:29:58] Luis Magalhaes: I had to open the motor because of a hall sensor but after that i have seen solder inside motor it was from 2 fase wires that dissolder after the hall problem
[2022-12-23T17:30:34] Luis Magalhaes: Did not check the the other one because it had conection the other 2 had no connection
[2022-12-23T17:30:49] Face de Pin Suc√©: Well, I think, when your wheel touches the ground after being on air, it pulls a lot of current and can cause a small error in Kelly
[2022-12-23T17:31:02] Face de Pin Suc√©: But if motor is hot is because of too much phase current x)
[2022-12-23T17:31:07] Luis Magalhaes: It was solder with 30w solder and fire to get it hot so maybe it was not a good solder too
[2022-12-23T17:31:55] Luis Magalhaes: The rear one was warm the front one was hot as i cant maintain my hand on it üòÖ
[2022-12-23T17:32:27] Luis Magalhaes: Don't have temperature sensor üòÖ
[2022-12-23T17:33:33] Mirono escooters: OwO
[2022-12-23T17:37:57] Luis Magalhaes: Maybe is the other fase wire is not doing a great contact point, could get hot because of that or no?
[2022-12-23T17:51:50] Face de Pin Suc√©: front, hotter than rear ? not normal x)
[2022-12-23T17:51:57] Face de Pin Suc√©: yes
[2022-12-23T17:56:07] Luis Magalhaes: Yes the front one was very hot, not normal, before the hall problem it get warm like now the rear motor it was after the hall problem, and after i resolder 2 fase wires that i seen that was not doing conection on the motor

[2022-12-26T16:20:47] Jan: it exchanges it with the environment
[2022-12-26T16:25:04] rosheee: heatpipes ftw
[2022-12-26T16:35:39] Jan: In our area of tdp it makes sense yes
[2022-12-26T18:40:27] Rogerio Figueiredo: Hello guys
[2022-12-26T18:40:31] Rogerio Figueiredo: <photos/photo_7135@26-12-2022_18-40-31.jpg>
[2022-12-26T18:40:41] Rogerio Figueiredo: Vesc tool for Mac OS?
[2022-12-26T18:40:48] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is there may build?
[2022-12-26T18:44:19] SirGeoff: Yes
[2022-12-26T19:05:05] Rogerio Figueiredo: i found it
[2022-12-26T19:05:07] Rogerio Figueiredo: thank you

[2022-12-27T03:15:36] Rogerio Figueiredo: Any better what of holding 75100 V2 to xiaomi frame?
[2022-12-27T03:16:25] Rogerio Figueiredo: Anyone has the link of vesc connectors?
[2022-12-27T04:02:15] Santiago: I have the same VESC lol
[2022-12-27T04:02:47] Santiago: I just cut the wires and crimped a different connector
[2022-12-27T04:06:04] Santiago: Drill 2 holes on the back and front and thread them
[2022-12-27T04:08:03] Santiago: And make something like this
[2022-12-27T04:09:00] Santiago: So you hold it in place
[2022-12-27T04:09:27] Santiago: I don't have a pic but this is what I did, uglier but it works
[2022-12-27T04:34:21] Rogerio Figueiredo: Can you take some. Pictures?
[2022-12-27T04:34:58] Rogerio Figueiredo: I was thinking in buy a aluminum cover and put it there with disssipator or somewlike duakyrow
[2022-12-27T04:35:35] Rogerio Figueiredo: <photos/photo_7140@27-12-2022_04-35-35.jpg>
[2022-12-27T04:36:09] Rogerio Figueiredo: Some one know if is possible to use this to connect xiaomi rear light 5v 0,5a
[2022-12-27T05:02:12] Quinn Foster: no use buck
[2022-12-27T10:29:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Untrue
[2022-12-27T10:29:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: He could but only would have static ,from ppm ir any unused actually
[2022-12-27T10:30:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: When its dumb no adc2 build ,ou have to do tricks ,but use a resistor also
[2022-12-27T17:22:27] Jan: <photos/photo_7141@27-12-2022_17-22-27.jpg>
[2022-12-27T17:22:31] Jan: Rion at its best
[2022-12-27T18:04:06] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But, i.e some guys got their rions on fbü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ Photos, videos etc
[2022-12-27T18:04:14] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Whats the problem with others?
[2022-12-27T18:24:36] Luis Magalhaes: Its not a cheap thing üòÖ
[2022-12-27T18:50:44] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, higher voltage - more expensive components and electronics overall. Also bigger components. More voltage - need more parallels, because of sag. 9p is way better than 6p.
[2022-12-27T18:50:51] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: None
[2022-12-27T18:51:14] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Atleast i asked here sometimes.. no news about these vescs..
[2022-12-27T18:54:06] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I would choose right now is middle kv motor and the highest and smallest escs with 20-22s
[2022-12-27T18:54:11] Luis Magalhaes: why you say you need more parallel's ? for the same output power you will need less current in a higher voltage setup
[2022-12-27T18:54:14] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Great balance
[2022-12-27T18:55:15] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Because you can calculate how battery will sags with 6p and 9p with different voltages
[2022-12-27T18:55:42] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 6p with 40t should be minimal to 30s config
[2022-12-27T18:55:47] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: In my opinion
[2022-12-27T18:56:09] Luis Magalhaes: yes but the sag cames from current you push not from your voltage, i think
[2022-12-27T18:56:30] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Depends what escs you working with
[2022-12-27T18:56:36] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Good 30s escs, ok. Find it
[2022-12-27T18:56:48] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Not right know actually
[2022-12-27T18:56:57] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 22s-25s, ok, maybe
[2022-12-27T18:57:01] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But no 30s
[2022-12-27T18:57:39] Luis Magalhaes: yes but if you compare same motor same current and diferent voltage, its similar sag i think
[2022-12-27T18:57:42] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I mean when its not like a brick or size half of the scooterüòÖ
[2022-12-27T18:58:25] Luis Magalhaes: yeah brick is going to come at 30s üòÇüòÇ
[2022-12-27T18:59:33] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Too ideal for this world
[2022-12-27T18:59:40] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Not in real situation
[2022-12-27T19:00:12] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: And as i said = more expensive and bigger components
[2022-12-27T19:00:17] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Size
[2022-12-27T19:00:57] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Thats the problem right here. You need the less sag as possible
[2022-12-27T19:01:58] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Per cell yea, but not for pack
[2022-12-27T19:02:16] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: And why you need 30s?
[2022-12-27T19:02:55] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Depends on esc coefficiency
[2022-12-27T19:03:01] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: This is too ideal
[2022-12-27T19:03:42] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You will actually have more sag then just in theory
[2022-12-27T19:03:45] Luis Magalhaes: the current comes from the parallel cells not from the series so if you have 60A capable battery at 100v or in 60v is not the same ?
[2022-12-27T19:03:54] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Because of tremendous amounts of other factors
[2022-12-27T19:04:50] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: The biggest problem is size of escs
[2022-12-27T19:04:57] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: And money, for someone
[2022-12-27T19:05:11] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Also - bigger emp
[2022-12-27T19:05:27] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But i think this should be corrected on esc stages
[2022-12-27T19:06:18] Luis Magalhaes: already gave me a knot in the brain üòÇ
[2022-12-27T19:06:25] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Bigger voltage means bigger distance between components
[2022-12-27T19:06:56] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: And signal chains
[2022-12-27T19:07:43] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Do 20s with middle kv motor, and push more current because you have not so big escs here
[2022-12-27T19:07:53] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Especially after 12fet ubox will come lol
[2022-12-27T19:08:08] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 30s... i thought about it too
[2022-12-27T19:08:15] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But.... no mobility anymore
[2022-12-27T19:08:23] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Too big escs
[2022-12-27T19:08:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Need too much space
[2022-12-27T19:08:33] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Esp if its awd
[2022-12-27T19:08:59] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Need to wait i think
[2022-12-27T19:09:08] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Maybe in 5 years will be something really good
[2022-12-27T19:09:31] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Tronic 750 lol
[2022-12-27T19:09:37] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But size
[2022-12-27T19:10:53] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Also, you can do low kv motor and give them field weakening in the end for extra speed. But on main part of voltage you will have the most torque
[2022-12-27T19:11:15] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: There are already 20s motors low kv and 100 kmh speed
[2022-12-27T19:11:23] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: With 10mmq phases ones
[2022-12-27T19:15:04] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ofc i agree more voltage = less continious currents on speed. But it is right when esc works right and can convert with less losses = more and more expensive components
[2022-12-27T19:17:48] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I think mp2 custom with 18fets can be good for 30s. There it seems in the instructions for it creator wrote that you can make it for 30s
[2022-12-27T19:17:48] Gordan Gizdic: Heres what i know, it comes from RCs and its hell on motors there
[2022-12-27T19:17:59] Gordan Gizdic: High KV brings a lot of heat quickly.
[2022-12-27T19:18:06] Gordan Gizdic: Low kv you can punish all day.
[2022-12-27T19:18:21] Gordan Gizdic: Also, low kv can handle field weakening easier.
[2022-12-27T19:18:34] Gordan Gizdic: We almost always used 2700kv motors on 8s.
[2022-12-27T19:18:47] Gordan Gizdic: After 8min race, motors would be supernova hot.
[2022-12-27T19:19:07] Gordan Gizdic: I tried lower kv motor, almost same results, motor was barely warm.
[2022-12-27T19:19:27] Gordan Gizdic: So higher voltage, lower kv is something i would run all day long.
[2022-12-27T19:19:47] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Thats what guys from eucs doing
[2022-12-27T19:19:50] Gordan Gizdic: And currents on those motors are in the range of 150-200A on 4s.
[2022-12-27T19:19:55] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Low kv big wheels and 30s already
[2022-12-27T19:20:06] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: V13 for example
[2022-12-27T19:20:09] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Inmotion
[2022-12-27T19:20:32] Gordan Gizdic: Also, i did speedruns with low kv motors and managed 267kmh, same setup high kv motor did a bit less.
[2022-12-27T19:20:53] Gordan Gizdic: It just runs out of power quicker in the high rpms.
[2022-12-27T19:20:56] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Low kv always will have with less current more torque
[2022-12-27T19:21:26] Gordan Gizdic: Nope, wrong.
[2022-12-27T19:21:26] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: It is!
[2022-12-27T19:21:48] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Beccuse of higher cross-section
[2022-12-27T19:22:14] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Low kv motors always will have less mmq then the same size high kv
[2022-12-27T19:22:26] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You limited by space inside motor
[2022-12-27T19:22:26] Gordan Gizdic: High kv motors have currents that are high all the time. Lower kv motors have idle currents much much lower, better efficiency also and can take some punishment.
[2022-12-27T19:22:56] Gordan Gizdic: Thats just what my experience is.
[2022-12-27T19:23:20] Gordan Gizdic: So in your case, high S count, mid KV motors might give you best of both worlds.
[2022-12-27T19:24:02] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ideally, we need to go more voltage, not so big sizes of escs and low kv motors, but already they can do 120-130 with that voltage lol
[2022-12-27T19:24:23] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Torque will be perfect, currents not so high
[2022-12-27T19:24:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Efficiency better
[2022-12-27T19:24:35] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But escs....
[2022-12-27T19:24:54] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Battery no problem, motors no problem
[2022-12-27T19:25:06] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Charger no problem
[2022-12-27T19:25:11] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Only esc and its size is the problem
[2022-12-27T19:26:04] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 30s6p with p45b and good to go
[2022-12-27T19:26:13] Gordan Gizdic: Also, take into consideration that 30s will kill. And thats a very serious problem.
[2022-12-27T19:26:18] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Or else high discharge rate one
[2022-12-27T19:26:59] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Hmm, can be already feeling bad, yes
[2022-12-27T19:27:20] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: This is another one reason
[2022-12-27T19:27:34] Gordan Gizdic: Its just something to take into a real important consideration.
[2022-12-27T19:28:02] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: For big production its veeery strong reason
[2022-12-27T19:28:02] Gordan Gizdic: Especiall if the pack is not mounted inside of the scoot.
[2022-12-27T19:28:27] Gordan Gizdic: If you go for 30s.
[2022-12-27T19:28:46] Gordan Gizdic: At least make sure you have quick fuses and not those automotive.
[2022-12-27T19:29:01] Gordan Gizdic: And i mean really really quick fuses.
[2022-12-27T19:29:02] Mirono escooters: 30s Esc oof
[2022-12-27T19:31:22] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ye, 30s bms is already big bitchüòÖ
[2022-12-27T19:31:26] Gordan Gizdic: But again, why something so fast?
[2022-12-27T19:31:45] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: There are no such things as fast
[2022-12-27T19:31:46] Gordan Gizdic: 70kmh is plenty for me. I mean, thats already scary fast.
[2022-12-27T19:32:14] Gordan Gizdic: I get that, but...
[2022-12-27T19:32:29] Gordan Gizdic: At those speeds, mistakes get really costly.
[2022-12-27T19:32:38] Gordan Gizdic: Idk, im just better safe than sorry.
[2022-12-27T19:32:58] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Go for segway gt frame
[2022-12-27T19:33:10] Mirono escooters: And need very low kv
[2022-12-27T19:33:13] Gordan Gizdic: So its more of a technology presentation with high speed capabilities?
[2022-12-27T19:33:17] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: That thing will not kill you on those speeds
[2022-12-27T19:33:37] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Because of best engineering
[2022-12-27T19:35:11] Mirono escooters: Well hard Todo, good quality and little weight
[2022-12-27T19:39:49] Unknown: What's your top speed now?
[2022-12-27T19:56:37] sombre_enfant: Do you mind tell your weight with gear ?
[2022-12-27T20:26:35] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: I did, C350 & 700, except Can issue, for the moment it work
[2022-12-27T20:27:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: Can doesn‚Äôt work?
[2022-12-27T20:41:59] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it work, but use very old Can transceiver and maybe it can be a cause of our issue with the can, but it's not sure yet
[2022-12-27T20:43:28] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Thermal it's perfect because it's Toll Mosfet on IMS PCB so it can't be better
[2022-12-27T20:46:37] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Lost can messages, but if you just plug two ESC together and nothing else it's work
[2022-12-27T20:48:57] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Our Display
[2022-12-27T20:49:36] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Our display send in Canbus everything for Throttle brake, and for Speed, power, current, voltage etc ...
[2022-12-27T20:49:59] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: and at high power on dual we have issue, but yet we dont know the source of the problem
[2022-12-27T20:50:43] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: We are on the way to increase our tranceiver can for someting in 5v and modern and if the problem persist we will try to filter a bit and if it's still not working, it will be the cause of the HESC
[2022-12-27T20:52:56] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Yes my Nami have Ubox 100v with 200A phase per motor, not any Can issue, but even with Hesc, the issue appear at higher current than that
[2022-12-27T20:55:17] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: you always need read the app or motor settings to be sure you dont send the same config than the first ESC, cuz if you send the same App cong in both you put the same ID can and after that you need connect by USB to change the Can of one on two esc, or disconnect the Can, it's a bit annoying, but it's not can issue
[2022-12-27T20:56:04] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: 5.2 & 6, Custom by us to solve this problem
[2022-12-27T20:57:09] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: no, it's hardware issue, inject fucking parasits in the ADC
[2022-12-27T21:02:17] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: i will diss with my partners about it
[2022-12-27T21:05:14] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: no manufacturer of Vesc tests them I think, they just copy, or create by copy and sell
[2022-12-27T21:05:18] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: the rest they dont care lol
[2022-12-27T21:06:21] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Except the Official Trampa of course
[2022-12-27T21:10:31] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it's on the way for, let's see in Janv 2023
[2022-12-27T21:12:00] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yeah, and Shul same, the first product we bough just not working at all, and it's us find why and the manufacturer make the modification for ...
[2022-12-27T21:12:31] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it was an stupid issue but so, enough for nothing can work normally
[2022-12-27T21:14:43] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Yes, it should be great üëç
[2022-12-27T21:22:17] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Yeah, i never tested that ESC upper than 20S actually but yeah 30S it should be crazy
[2022-12-27T21:22:45] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but at 30S need very high pr√©caution on power line, BMS esc
[2022-12-27T21:23:53] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: I'm actually on the way to fix the C700 on my sur Ron
[2022-12-27T21:26:18] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Isolation, short circuit protect etc, BMS can be turned off/on because we dont correct 30S like 16S
[2022-12-27T21:28:35] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: 22S8P 50E, C700, SmartDisplay, SmartExpress, Smart_Light nothing crazy crazy
[2022-12-27T21:29:51] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: unfortunately no, your a pin on the low power connector which supplies the regulator on which you must put Vbat (or whatever you want between 20v and Vbat)
[2022-12-27T21:31:05] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Smart_Express is the Replica of the VESC_Express the new Ble/Wifi module on Canbus of Vedder, and Smart_Light it's the module on the Canbus to manage the lights by the Smart Display
[2022-12-27T21:32:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: 80A continuos
[2022-12-27T21:33:07] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Theorique, but you can pull 20A/cell if you want üòÜ
[2022-12-27T21:33:36] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: i discharge one Cell at 15A constant and it was better than the LT and very close with the 50S ... üòÜ
[2022-12-27T21:34:03] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: and with cooling you probably can pull more than that const
[2022-12-27T21:34:32] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: non 50E 1 or 2 haha
[2022-12-27T21:34:38] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: the Refurbish
[2022-12-27T21:36:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, but is even a 10A cell. Chemistry is not made for high current discharge , this will destroy cell life much quicker
[2022-12-27T21:36:37] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Yeah > 50S > 40T but, even if you discharge the 40T and the 50E at 15A const, you get more energy from the 50E than the 40T so ...
[2022-12-27T21:37:06] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: and on Sur ron, it's totally useless the high discharge, we dont pump enough on the battery
[2022-12-27T21:37:59] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yes, that depend your config and your use, for Track scooter like our compact it's not possible, need 40T or other high decharge Cell
[2022-12-27T21:38:35] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yeah, but it's still not available right ? and price yeah crying
[2022-12-27T21:39:41] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Depend of what is your Target, Tire etc
[2022-12-27T21:41:16] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: for the 75H we will have since January on our webside the Rims to put Standard 11" tire on the 75H motor
[2022-12-27T21:42:16] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it's shit yes, all Weped tire is shit if you want my advice üòÜ
[2022-12-27T21:42:47] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: in construction, it will be published in January
[2022-12-27T21:43:43] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: and for the High Torque version, KV 23.3, ~ 98kmh on 84v on no load
[2022-12-27T21:44:10] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: 145kmh @ 125v
[2022-12-27T21:44:15] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: with 266mm wheel
[2022-12-27T21:46:25] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: for comparaison, Our compact have 70H high speed, in 20S, on 84V no load 187 kmh, on the floor, full charge, ~145 kmh
[2022-12-27T21:46:53] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: with 20S6P 40T
[2022-12-27T21:47:56] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: then the Low Kv if you want 0-100kmh crazy it's the good choice
[2022-12-27T21:50:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 126v continuous with high current is very dangerous for humans. humidity, short, you die... 20s is already dangerous
[2022-12-27T21:52:07] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: <photos/photo_7143@27-12-2022_21-52-07.jpg>
[2022-12-27T21:52:24] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: with the Rim for "normal" tire, little bit more big, yeah
[2022-12-27T21:53:11] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: with properly built everything Battery until motor, wires etc
[2022-12-27T21:54:06] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: 126VDC it's not anodin, i already had an ESC was shorted in 32S, it's Instant explode the Cell and get firework
[2022-12-27T21:54:27] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: instantly*
[2022-12-27T21:54:51] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: more the voltage is high more the CEM is important, and more the reaction is violent
[2022-12-27T21:55:41] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: no BMS üòÜ but i dont know if classic BMS can manage that, in my case at that voltage i will use Breaker or high voltage Fuse
[2022-12-27T21:56:39] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it was not on vehicule, it was Lab experience
[2022-12-27T21:58:26] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: i told you, 126V = 150 kmh low Kv 84v = 168 High Kv after it is up to you to deduce with the Sag the discharge the objectives etc what you want
[2022-12-27T21:59:29] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but the acceleration at 0 speed with the High speed motor in dual 350A phase is not Amazing, but it start to be crazy when you accelerate at already 50 kmh with the low Kv you can pull 350A the Start at 0 speed will be crazy
[2022-12-27T21:59:55] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: After, you can try to put dual C700 on High Speed motor :D
[2022-12-27T22:00:34] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: 30
[2022-12-27T22:00:48] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but it's joke, it's too big
[2022-12-27T22:00:50] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Yes
[2022-12-27T22:01:04] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: I call them fridges
[2022-12-27T22:01:18] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: even for a Surron it's too big
[2022-12-27T22:01:28] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: i can't imagin on scooter (trotinette √©lectrique)
[2022-12-27T22:02:34] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Not, but of you take High Torque on 70H it's more KV, and low torque on 70H is more KV too than the 75H low torque
[2022-12-27T22:03:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes !
[2022-12-27T22:03:31] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: hum, i dont know, but you have the size on the 3shul webside
[2022-12-27T22:04:14] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: 28.6
[2022-12-27T22:04:28] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: 185 kmh @ 126v no load
[2022-12-27T22:04:46] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: the KV of motor is constant
[2022-12-27T22:05:11] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: 20S 123 kmh no load
[2022-12-27T22:05:22] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yeah i see that xD
[2022-12-27T22:05:38] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but we will post the Specs of the motor when we will open the Webside
[2022-12-27T22:05:47] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it will be on the Product description
[2022-12-27T22:06:28] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Yes it work but it loose lots of energy, it's the pity thing with the Field Weak
[2022-12-27T22:07:03] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: 70H is with fixed Rim, fit for classic 11" tires yes
[2022-12-27T22:07:27] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: the 75 is with amovible Rim, and need buy separately the rim you want
[2022-12-27T22:07:51] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: the 70H ?
[2022-12-27T22:08:52] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: we pull 350 on our high speed, the high torque can accept less, but i dont know, it will depend how long especially, but i think 350 will be fine, but less time compare with the High Speed one
[2022-12-27T22:09:38] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but you also need less current for the same Torque than the High speed, so at 350 it will be crazy probably and probably too much, i dont know, test and tell us =D
[2022-12-27T22:11:21] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: i dont know the Specs of Vset motors, it's not on my sheets
[2022-12-27T22:11:54] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: ah oki

[2022-12-27T22:13:04] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but i never try with Field Weak
[2022-12-27T22:13:47] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: not that much, i think it's something like 3~4 kw at 100kmh no more
[2022-12-27T22:14:11] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: 60H
[2022-12-27T22:14:54] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: mine yes, it pull 160A ~ 10 kw Const like 5 secondes, and peak 15kw
[2022-12-27T22:15:16] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: the problem for me is the battery not the ESC
[2022-12-27T22:15:27] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: i still have the shit OEM Chinese battery
[2022-12-27T22:15:44] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yes i custom it totally, like 6h of work on it
[2022-12-27T22:16:18] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: 35 Panasonic but r√©al 30Ah noname battery at 2A discharge
[2022-12-27T22:17:09] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yes it's know in France, it make big scandal when people found out

[2022-12-27T22:21:05] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: and imagin i pull like 160A on that copy MH1 20S10P battery üòÜ
[2022-12-27T22:21:42] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: not that bad too be honest, but i charge it at 1C, 1.2C, and pull like very more than it's normally, so now the battery is tired hahaha
[2022-12-27T22:21:56] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: of course, i can run on track long time...
[2022-12-27T22:22:16] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: in addition i have the electronic brake of course with Vesc üòÜ
[2022-12-27T22:22:27] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: brake up to 4Kw
[2022-12-27T22:23:01] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but on Track, i use the Disc and little bit of Elec brake for limiting the Heat, of the Battery but also Esc
[2022-12-27T22:23:43] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: because Even with my Custom the Spinted can't dissipated as much as supported acceleration braking acceleration braking continuously
[2022-12-27T22:24:04] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Yes but OEM ubox is just useless üòÜ
[2022-12-27T22:24:26] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Yes

[2022-12-27T22:36:30] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yeah, for the case esc I want to be removable but waterproof I use silicon grease
[2022-12-27T22:39:20] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yes
[2022-12-27T22:44:04] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: not 75H need more large arm, but 70H can Fit for Dualtron, Nami, etc without make new arms etc, just need washer to spread your arms slightly
[2022-12-27T22:45:02] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: i dont know this machin, but probably yes, i dont have the size in head, but wait 2023 for our webside
[2022-12-27T22:47:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: Best is likely yyk, 3kg of aluminium üòÇüòÇ
[2022-12-27T22:48:57] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: They are biiig

[2022-12-27T22:52:01] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: So you turn off system by bms or what?
[2022-12-27T22:52:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: You even need a antispark
[2022-12-27T22:52:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: If u do too much times mosfet will die
[2022-12-27T22:52:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because mosfet absorb the spark :(
[2022-12-27T22:52:38] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ye, its the reason too
[2022-12-27T22:53:40] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: i agree with you üòÜ if we finish our ESC one day, it will have that of course
[2022-12-27T22:54:03] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Please, will follow for it
[2022-12-27T22:55:00] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: no, it's far to be available, you can focus on Hesc yet
[2022-12-27T22:55:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Died again these shit
[2022-12-27T22:55:57] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: no you have Pin who power the logic on the Hesc, you need pul 20v~Vbat on this Pin to turn on the Esc
[2022-12-27T22:56:06] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: and of course, disconnect that wire to turn off
[2022-12-27T22:56:26] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but it's not "latch"
[2022-12-27T22:56:41] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it's ok for use with stupid switch but it's not modern
[2022-12-27T22:56:54] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it's like Minimotors, Kelly etc
[2022-12-27T22:57:01] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ok, got it
[2022-12-27T22:57:13] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: sure
[2022-12-27T22:57:45] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: they let's that option, but not need to use, that good with the Spinted, you have 3 option of power
[2022-12-27T22:58:17] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: 1 Smart with the button 2 Stupid like Kelly, Minimo etc with Vbat Back 3 with the 5v on the Canbus
[2022-12-27T22:59:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: I can‚Äôt believe
[2022-12-27T22:59:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: Controller totally died
[2022-12-27T22:59:26] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: you mean the single ?
[2022-12-27T22:59:40] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Ah the Single 100
[2022-12-27T22:59:46] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: oh, i didn't know that
[2022-12-27T23:00:17] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Why ? üòÜ
[2022-12-27T23:00:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think is wrong the pinout of this st link lol
[2022-12-27T23:01:05] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Yes but it's that no ?
[2022-12-27T23:01:38] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: why 4 wires on Button ?
[2022-12-27T23:02:13] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: R Red ? G Green ? dual color button ?
[2022-12-27T23:02:35] Konstantin: 2 pin to power on. 1 for green 1 for red LEDs...
[2022-12-27T23:03:16] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but for me it's not have sense that if the single dont work like the Dual, Even the Switch and Gnd it's need circuit to latch the main regulator, if it's sutpid button permanent it's line Vbat and Vbat back, like in Front of Ubox V2 Dual
[2022-12-27T23:03:38] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but you are sure it's not like that on the Single ?
[2022-12-27T23:04:01] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But, can use any button within 5v. Just sw and gnd
[2022-12-27T23:04:01] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: oki, üòÜ Stupid
[2022-12-27T23:04:02] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: No?
[2022-12-27T23:04:08] Konstantin: Use like this, all ok...
[2022-12-27T23:04:41] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: dont have the NXP ship inside ?
[2022-12-27T23:04:56] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: NRF* sorry
[2022-12-27T23:05:07] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Ah they dont have the NRF inside ?
[2022-12-27T23:05:58] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: james do they have the NRF ship inside ?
[2022-12-27T23:06:16] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: The Nrf for the Remote control ?
[2022-12-27T23:06:57] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Yeah but NRF port can be for BLE alo
[2022-12-27T23:07:33] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: for exemple the V1 dual have Dual NRF, one for Remote controller and second for BLE, on the V2 they are removed the BLE and add port for connect external BLE
[2022-12-27T23:07:58] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but if they Removed the second NRF for the Remote it's normal you dont have Latch because it's the NRF is used to manage the Latch üòÜ
[2022-12-27T23:08:47] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Oki, that why
[2022-12-27T23:08:56] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Yeah, so it's that
[2022-12-27T23:09:01] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: no NRF no Latch
[2022-12-27T23:09:39] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: They are considered the Single is not for Skate so not need NRF, and if no NRF no latch
[2022-12-27T23:09:51] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but they add the IMU to can work for unicycle
[2022-12-27T23:10:36] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but the stupid things it's Vesc had implemented the Latch fonction, so they can use the STM32 of the Vesc also to manage the Latch üòÜ
[2022-12-27T23:10:41] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: and that cost nothing more
[2022-12-27T23:11:36] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Maybe thy dont because if you use for Unicycle and you set auto off timer, he probably Can turn of when you ride Hahaha
[2022-12-27T23:11:46] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: i dont think Vedder ad protection for that
[2022-12-27T23:12:27] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but it's worst because if the Switch with vibration is turned off it's same issue like it's now üòÜ
[2022-12-27T23:13:08] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: hey look, they have two Ignite/power option also
[2022-12-27T23:13:27] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: that is like you said basic method to turn on
[2022-12-27T23:14:17] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but by that, i think it's normal press it turn on, and press again to turn off, not exacly like Ubox Dual, but like Trampa or Vedder method
[2022-12-27T23:14:22] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: managed by the STM
[2022-12-27T23:17:48] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: i think they do
[2022-12-27T23:17:56] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: by that port
[2022-12-27T23:20:09] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: did you set the Shutdown Mode ?
[2022-12-27T23:21:23] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: hum, it make no sens üòÜ
[2022-12-27T23:22:34] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: that is normal it's not connected the same, in fact it's dangerous that
[2022-12-27T23:22:54] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but try to swich just SW and GND one time
[2022-12-27T23:23:09] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: and set in Vesctool sometime not Const Off
[2022-12-27T23:24:46] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it's can't be like Dual because no NRF, but it can be like official VESC, and if the setting is Always_Off, it's normal that if you disconnect it turn Off
[2022-12-27T23:25:17] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: in opposite if you select Always On you can't turn off
[2022-12-27T23:25:41] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: and the fonction "normal" should be (Toggle_Button_Only)
[2022-12-27T23:25:55] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it's in App Settings > General
[2022-12-27T23:26:30] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: no i dont know
[2022-12-27T23:27:38] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but they are not totally stupid, if you have two connector to Ingnite, if they two diffrent input work exacly the same it's totally useless and stupid, and Even if the Developer dont think of everything, they can't do a stupid things like that volontary
[2022-12-27T23:29:08] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: good
[2022-12-27T23:29:50] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: you have to know, the Custom service of Spinted and most company know nothing about the product they Sell !
[2022-12-27T23:30:14] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: if you dont speak with an Technician, you need consider talking with nothing
[2022-12-27T23:30:26] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yes
[2022-12-27T23:31:39] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: for that, Even them don't know why üòÜ
[2022-12-27T23:31:55] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: i think, we are the only one to know why and unlock the problem
[2022-12-27T23:32:59] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: they dont care, we wanted to distribute their products, but they Give any magine, so it's impossible
[2022-12-27T23:33:42] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yes, and Spinted make very small magin so they can't make more for b2b
[2022-12-27T23:34:07] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: You have company ? who you are ?
[2022-12-27T23:35:40] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Ah Sweden
[2022-12-27T23:37:11] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: haha, and i was working in Urban360 before, if you know
[2022-12-27T23:37:24] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: in 2015 it was big store in Paris
[2022-12-27T23:41:25] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Yeah, it's good motors
[2022-12-27T23:41:34] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: you make preparation in Sweden ?
[2022-12-27T23:43:14] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Sourcing > Selling B2B B2C Conception > manufacturing > Selling B2B B2C Preparation
[2022-12-27T23:44:42] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: not complete Scooter, Except if we Prepare it, not Parts, Except if it's Custom like Motors, SmartDisplay etc
[2022-12-27T23:44:55] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: we will sell battery, and Pack Esc + harness + battery also
[2022-12-27T23:45:32] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but it is the least lucrative
[2022-12-27T23:46:13] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but what we want is to make the environment evolve, bring the best technology
[2022-12-27T23:46:57] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: ah yes, like FastRide for many parts
[2022-12-27T23:47:03] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: like PMT
[2022-12-27T23:47:50] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Yes clear, but Fastride Also, they Sell without margin to get more customers visit them store and buy scooter
[2022-12-27T23:48:28] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: they kicked us with our motor too
[2022-12-27T23:48:51] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Also in france, Haha
[2022-12-27T23:49:10] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Over busy company espacially
[2022-12-27T23:49:58] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Yeah, but they also have Karma, them new shop burned
[2022-12-27T23:50:17] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: 2 levels destroy
[2022-12-27T23:50:48] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: I don't wish that for them, but I think there's a little karma in it
[2022-12-27T23:51:09] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: no, we dont know exacly
[2022-12-27T23:51:36] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: maybe, also you know, they have 0 skill in electronics
[2022-12-27T23:52:40] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Julien is a good M√©canicien, he come from that, but 0 on electronics, When you whats them Video you see that they absolutly dont have any Idea about how all that work lol
[2022-12-27T23:53:29] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: on the other hand, they are good at poaching guys who know and integrating them into their team, until rejecting them when they become useless
[2022-12-27T23:53:54] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: in detail it's hard üòÜ
[2022-12-27T23:54:40] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Shitty for morality, but efficiency for the Bisness
[2022-12-27T23:54:52] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: for that he is Rich and we are poor lol
[2022-12-27T23:55:30] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Yeah, and it was worst before when i start in 2015
[2022-12-27T23:55:49] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: no really not, i can't see anymore all that shit
[2022-12-27T23:57:39] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: with customers who come to piss you off with my Disc brake make sound, and this and that... my Tire in deflate i bough it 700‚Ç¨ it's intolerable, yeah but when you receive your order start by inflate your tires asshole üòì
[2022-12-27T23:58:03] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: 2 years in Urban360 Paris and 1 Year in BlueWay Spain to ear that shit i can't anymore üòÜ
[2022-12-27T23:58:33] sombre_enfant: Its not really worth to sell scooter, tire repair make it better cant do much margin on scooter
[2022-12-27T23:59:20] sombre_enfant: Even worse on electronic repair and part replacement
[2022-12-28T00:01:05] sombre_enfant: Volt is the only good distributor greenrides or the other shitty brand dont manage stuff or sell part direct to customer
[2022-12-28T00:03:06] sombre_enfant: Do they have part in your country or they on Paris flat ?
[2022-12-28T00:03:57] Mirono escooters: What's B2B?
[2022-12-28T00:04:06] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it's not bad too when you use importator, it's them responsability to avoid the Waranty, you just Sell, manage the customer and get the benefit
[2022-12-28T00:04:23] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it's more Risk for the importator/distrubutor
[2022-12-28T00:04:38] sombre_enfant: Volt kinda quick good price always part stock and warranty free ship direct to customer...
[2022-12-28T00:05:06] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Ah yeah, that true !
[2022-12-28T00:05:27] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: more easy to ignore the customer very far for sure ...
[2022-12-28T00:05:42] sombre_enfant: Been waiting for back pedal replacement for a while
[2022-12-28T00:07:20] sombre_enfant: Greenrides 10+
[2022-12-28T00:07:36] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: haha, you know in Urban360 when we selled Inmotion V8 etc, we had a conflit with Inmotion France, and they was doing it on purpose to delay as much as possible and refuse the guarantees finally we bought new machines on Amazon which came from the same supplier, we took the spare parts on them to see the complete machine and we sent the machine back to our customers in the boxes, like that in the face of the distributor via Amazon xD
[2022-12-28T00:07:37] sombre_enfant: Wattmob

[2022-12-28T00:11:21] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: you have piqued my curiosity and suddenly I have not finished my installatin of C700 ü´£
[2022-12-28T00:13:37] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yes, let's keep in touch, maybe we could work together in the future
[2022-12-28T00:14:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: Damn, why the fuck did you bought from him ? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2022-12-28T00:21:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: Sooo bad
[2022-12-28T00:21:49] Face de Pin Suc√©: He's trying to sell his shop
[2022-12-28T00:22:28] Face de Pin Suc√©: He has now 12 months unpaied rent
[2022-12-28T00:22:45] Face de Pin Suc√©: I don't know
[2022-12-28T00:22:56] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: law in france is not that easy
[2022-12-28T00:23:07] Face de Pin Suc√©: He's very long to contact importators when he has a warranty
[2022-12-28T00:23:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: That sort of things
[2022-12-28T00:24:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: He still owes me like 400+500‚Ç¨
[2022-12-28T00:25:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: But it's not from a bill, so, hard to legally ask and I don't want to kick him, already had to do once
[2022-12-28T00:25:41] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes
[2022-12-28T00:28:44] sombre_enfant: Not my buiseness...
[2022-12-28T00:30:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's only to tell, never trust this guy
[2022-12-28T00:31:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: He seems nice until he fucks you up
[2022-12-28T00:31:37] sombre_enfant: Il cherchais un 35h mdrrr

[2022-12-28T01:35:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes MP2 should do 30S and is small. I will try it myself when I get to it. I had the same thing in mind of going 30S for my G30D project, but due to BMS and chargers not really affordable/available it was not an option. But with two batts I might try, got enough here for testing.
[2022-12-28T01:40:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: 2 15s in seriesüòÅ
[2022-12-28T01:50:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: Guys, my 75100 died after bms cut off
[2022-12-28T01:54:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt know even how it‚Äôs died
[2022-12-28T01:54:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: MOSFETs? For me on every BMS cut out the MOSFETs toasted
[2022-12-28T01:54:39] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but everything else ok
[2022-12-28T01:54:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: It started to accelerate by it self , and bms cutted, then even st link can‚Äôt power it
[2022-12-28T01:55:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: No lol, no smell or smoke, motor isn‚Äôt brakes. This time only logic board failed
[2022-12-28T01:55:28] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Oh. Yeah have one here too, which doesn't power on anymore, but sudden acceleration weird
[2022-12-28T01:56:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: Fortunately wasn‚Äôt accelerating with full power, motor was doing very big noise , and after bms cut
[2022-12-28T01:57:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: Lol, flipsky
[2022-12-28T01:57:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: But was connected with rear motor the flipsky, where more power is required
[2022-12-28T02:06:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think I did my bad too
[2022-12-28T02:06:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: I connected reversed polarity hall and reversed polarity st link üòÜ
[2022-12-28T02:07:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: But lol, I believed wire color and st link pinout
[2022-12-28T02:07:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Both wrong
[2022-12-28T02:49:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I had a guy who fried his Flipsky every week. üòÖ From regular flipsky 75100 to the alupcb, Makerbase etc. I still don't know how he has done it, but some of them turned into charcoal
[2022-12-28T02:53:30] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes. They work well, until they suddenly decide to die. üò¨ But most of my fails was caused by BMS cut, only once had one die randomly.
[2022-12-28T02:55:47] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yeah
[2022-12-28T03:59:18] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Did you set the that parameter ?
[2022-12-28T03:59:33] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: <photos/photo_7157@28-12-2022_03-59-33.jpg>
[2022-12-28T04:00:47] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: if you set or it is set upper than the max voltage of the ESC - ~5% it's normal you kill it
[2022-12-28T04:02:03] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it's better to set that voltage like 5V upper the max voltage of the battery
[2022-12-28T04:04:18] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: other think it's if the driver mosfets doesn't have OVLO cut out, if you have power supply cut it can make shit with the mosfets commutation and kill it, but for me it's fucking rare that case
[2022-12-28T10:23:38] rosheee: All fake accounts of thompson

[2022-12-28T12:28:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think it‚Äôs very good, but why not smartphone directly ü§®
[2022-12-28T12:37:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I hate multiple things about smartphone on the handlebar : - fixation take too much space on the handlebar and it's useless if the phone is not installed - you need to install it / remove it everytime you need guidance - you have 2 places to look (escooter display + smartphone) - my smartphone felt 2 times for me (GUB fixation)
[2022-12-28T12:46:07] S1m 0n: looks good. what is the mass of it?
[2022-12-28T12:46:53] koxx / Francois Deslandes: the display weight ?
[2022-12-28T12:48:40] Face de Pin Suc√©: I hate smarphone on handlebar
[2022-12-28T12:49:32] S1m 0n: length x width
[2022-12-28T12:49:41] sombre_enfant: I broke mine once... I hitted a speed bump a bit too fast phone flyed away
[2022-12-28T12:50:33] S1m 0n: i don't think there is a good holder for jumps handling at 50kmh+
[2022-12-28T12:50:59] S1m 0n: Or at least I don't trust any bracket on that point
[2022-12-28T12:52:23] Face de Pin Suc√©: Imagine at 140Kmh
[2022-12-28T12:52:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: I did once, was so scared the phone fly, I removed and putted in my pocket
[2022-12-28T12:54:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 10cm x 6.5cm 3.5" screen
[2022-12-28T12:59:20] S1m 0n: Nice, a lil bit smaller than new vsett display. when will it be available for purchase?
[2022-12-28T12:59:43] koxx / Francois Deslandes: still discussing with the factory ;)
[2022-12-28T13:02:35] S1m 0n: argh I need it to finally be able to use vesc
[2022-12-28T13:03:19] sombre_enfant: U didnt finish to convert the vsett display to vesc ?
[2022-12-28T13:19:37] S1m 0n: no it's stalling.while I was waiting for parts I started other projects and now I don't feel the need to resume the Vsett project. I also lack programming skills to be able to write code from scratch
[2022-12-28T13:31:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes but considering the price, you can put fixed phone for the purpose (just my thinking)
[2022-12-28T13:40:51] S1m 0n: A cheap smartphone with wireless charging, in a 3D print that looks like a display. In my country, it is unimaginable to drive with only a cell phone as a speedometer. If you glue a few cables to it, no one will notice.
[2022-12-28T13:41:40] S1m 0n: But I also do not have 3D printing and would have no skills to remove what does not look like from the 3D printer
[2022-12-28T14:07:04] Face de Pin Suc√©: But SmartDisplay does many more things than displaying speed or GPS, many things that a Smartphone can't do
[2022-12-28T14:34:33] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: SmartDisplay is the interface with the Scooter, it's not comparable with Smartphone, but the SmartDisplay exchange with the Smartphone for extent the experience

[2022-12-28T21:40:04] Face de Pin Suc√©: 332A from 20S6P 40T üòÖ
[2022-12-28T21:40:29] Face de Pin Suc√©: 21400W, can do a lot more considering I didn't push full throttle yet ü•∞ü•∞
[2022-12-28T21:51:21] Luis Magalhaes: üõ¥üî•
[2022-12-28T21:51:47] Luis Magalhaes: How much sag? üòÇ
[2022-12-28T22:24:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: A lot hahaha
[2022-12-28T22:24:49] Face de Pin Suc√©: Okay XD
[2022-12-28T22:33:09] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Around 55A per parallel. Wtf
[2022-12-28T22:33:22] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's a peak power
[2022-12-28T22:33:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: Like 3 seconds max
[2022-12-28T22:33:31] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Anyway
[2022-12-28T23:26:46] Face de Pin Suc√©: Don't know
[2022-12-29T01:04:07] rosheee: I just have smartphone
[2022-12-29T01:04:30] rosheee: Me2
[2022-12-29T01:04:43] rosheee: 15V
[2022-12-29T01:09:01] rosheee: I had 19v sag at 325A with 10degrees C battery temp
[2022-12-29T01:09:19] Gordan Gizdic: You had no voltage left. üòÇ
[2022-12-29T01:09:34] rosheee: Vesc shows wrong
[2022-12-29T01:09:41] rosheee: Cutoff is at 57V
[2022-12-29T01:09:54] rosheee: I had 62-64V
[2022-12-29T01:17:13] rosheee: But what amps?
[2022-12-29T01:23:55] Gordan Gizdic: Around 60
[2022-12-29T01:24:00] Gordan Gizdic: With sport
[2022-12-29T01:24:11] Gordan Gizdic: And it sags about 6-8V
[2022-12-29T01:24:14] Gordan Gizdic: Depends.
[2022-12-29T01:24:24] Gordan Gizdic: If 20.8ah, than more. 28ah less.
[2022-12-29T01:29:32] Gordan Gizdic: I cant say i managed to sag 11V on a stock Vsett.
[2022-12-29T01:29:41] Gordan Gizdic: Never.
[2022-12-29T01:29:48] Gordan Gizdic: And i really did try it.
[2022-12-29T01:30:02] Gordan Gizdic: Max was in the 8V range, sport and up the hill
[2022-12-29T01:30:11] Gordan Gizdic: Maybe colder where you live?
[2022-12-29T01:30:20] Gordan Gizdic: Yup, that explains it.
[2022-12-29T01:32:03] Gordan Gizdic: 28 and 20.8
[2022-12-29T01:32:07] Gordan Gizdic: Using them both
[2022-12-29T01:32:13] Gordan Gizdic: To full potential. üòÇ
[2022-12-29T01:34:01] Gordan Gizdic: I see low temps maybe 3 month in a year.
[2022-12-29T01:34:22] Gordan Gizdic: But, i cant complain about battery sag being too big.
[2022-12-29T01:34:43] Gordan Gizdic: Idk, i got some limits in my head so i never push things all the way.
[2022-12-29T01:35:08] Gordan Gizdic: I mean, its 15 degrees here in Croatia in 12th month.
[2022-12-29T01:35:19] Gordan Gizdic: Thats a bit high for this time of the year.
[2022-12-29T01:35:55] Gordan Gizdic: Nah, laws suck but cops usually dont bother us.
[2022-12-29T01:36:02] Gordan Gizdic: Lazy fucks most of the time.
[2022-12-29T01:36:04] Gordan Gizdic: Tbh.
[2022-12-29T01:36:23] Gordan Gizdic: Mostly they stop me to check the scoot.
[2022-12-29T01:36:49] Gordan Gizdic: I dont run
[2022-12-29T01:39:23] Gordan Gizdic: I know but im not scared of those fucks and have a good lawyer.
[2022-12-29T01:39:31] Gordan Gizdic: Also, they mostly bother kids.
[2022-12-29T01:39:56] Gordan Gizdic: I got my gear, respect others and when i take off my helmet, theres no problems.
[2022-12-29T01:40:19] Gordan Gizdic: That banter starts 99 percent of the time.
[2022-12-29T01:48:34] rosheee: took my 16s once for 1 week no prob
[2022-12-29T01:49:38] rosheee: but not looking forward for 2nd time
[2022-12-29T01:49:55] rosheee: yep
[2022-12-29T01:50:02] rosheee: but problem was
[2022-12-29T01:50:10] rosheee: haven't changed "acceleration" to 30%
[2022-12-29T01:50:18] rosheee: so it had 100% boost from 0-20kmh
[2022-12-29T01:50:23] rosheee: xD
[2022-12-29T01:50:27] rosheee: police pushed 100% throttle
[2022-12-29T01:50:45] rosheee: then changed while they called backup for alcohol
[2022-12-29T01:51:01] rosheee: "mr. strebel we both know that this scooter goes more than 20kmh"
[2022-12-29T01:51:04] rosheee: and i was like "yes"
[2022-12-29T01:51:19] rosheee: but if i wanna change that i have to take whole shit apart and usb and laptop and nadnadnad
[2022-12-29T01:51:22] rosheee: takes 20-40min
[2022-12-29T01:52:21] rosheee: then they took scooter for 1 week
[2022-12-29T01:52:31] rosheee: tested max power, speed, brakepower n all shit
[2022-12-29T01:52:31] Gordan Gizdic: Nah, cant take my scoot away, max ticket i can get it 200eur but if i pay in 3 days or less, than is 100e. + 100eur of they catch me on the road.
[2022-12-29T01:52:40] Gordan Gizdic: Than i can complain and go to court.
[2022-12-29T01:52:47] rosheee: here they take scotoer away and then u're fucked if 2 fast
[2022-12-29T01:52:58] Gordan Gizdic: So yeah, not that fucked as it could be.
[2022-12-29T01:53:18] rosheee: then u get like "illegal vehicle" "no insurance" "to fast" "no license" and and and....
[2022-12-29T01:53:19] Gordan Gizdic: They can lollipop my dick, not giving it for anything.
[2022-12-29T01:53:28] Gordan Gizdic: Nah, no such thing here.
[2022-12-29T01:53:37] rosheee: and $ goes after what u earn
[2022-12-29T01:53:41] rosheee: then u loose driving license
[2022-12-29T01:54:07] Gordan Gizdic: They can ticket me only for driving on the main road and maybe for more power but they dont have rhe equipment to test.
[2022-12-29T01:54:10] rosheee: and get like 1000-15'000 or more fine
[2022-12-29T01:54:14] Gordan Gizdic: And my stock profile is legal.
[2022-12-29T01:54:42] Gordan Gizdic: You live in opressive contry. What can i say?

[2022-12-29T06:25:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: Because running 5.3 firmware on my side
[2022-12-29T06:25:30] rosheee: Think so On both phones no gps
[2022-12-29T06:25:42] rosheee: Use old one
[2022-12-29T06:25:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: Have to find it haha

[2022-12-29T06:28:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: Before run, charge at 35-40A from 70V to 84V
[2022-12-29T06:28:26] rosheee: XD only 8A charger
[2022-12-29T06:28:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: It will heat the battery to like 45¬∞C
[2022-12-29T06:28:36] rosheee: XD
[2022-12-29T06:28:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: Haha you need better charger then
[2022-12-29T06:28:49] rosheee: U have suc√©?
[2022-12-29T06:29:10] rosheee: Link? The one u have not available anymore
[2022-12-29T06:29:24] Face de Pin Suc√©: I bought many months ago
[2022-12-29T06:29:41] Face de Pin Suc√©: Can maybe sell one to you, have to ask to a friend that has some maybe
[2022-12-29T06:29:48] rosheee: <sticker>

[2022-12-29T08:51:20] Thierry: Acceleration with singke speed monorim is not that good.
[2022-12-29T08:55:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Took a look , first thing after install was game advertisement= delete Also try gps tool ,look the same but way more knowledge
[2022-12-29T08:56:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: A lot
[2022-12-29T08:56:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Whole skynet hunting for rs
[2022-12-29T08:57:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But Till you dont have some fancy device what can keep up with you and your speed it's hard
[2022-12-29T08:59:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I mean these mostly say 20m is accuracy by app and phone gps
[2022-12-29T09:00:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And on bad day this can mean a lot in numbers
[2022-12-29T09:21:05] rosheee: argh
[2022-12-29T09:21:09] rosheee: to dangerous today
[2022-12-29T09:21:16] rosheee: but the last shizzl i had from vesc
[2022-12-29T09:22:06] Ohad Avishay Shatz: Are business owners here in the group did anyone have any good long business relationship with Chinese vendors? I have tried flipsky for few years awful after service , makerx a bit batter but mostly same , any advices?
[2022-12-29T09:25:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: Nope
[2022-12-29T09:25:38] Ohad Avishay Shatz: funn..
[2022-12-29T12:16:23] Rogerio Figueiredo: It sucks
[2022-12-29T12:16:43] Rogerio Figueiredo: I can't put more than 70a on motor I get error
[2022-12-29T12:27:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: You have to push up absolute maximum current too
[2022-12-29T12:28:11] Rogerio Figueiredo: How can I do that?
[2022-12-29T12:30:19] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Does it affect on acceleration? Not just phase current at the start? In the info box it says that this is just a limit for issuing an error of max current spike or similar
[2022-12-29T12:31:41] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is like the current doesn't go at start
[2022-12-29T12:31:54] Rogerio Figueiredo: Only when gets rotation and even there is week
[2022-12-29T12:32:08] Rogerio Figueiredo: It cuts when reach 43km
[2022-12-29T12:32:21] Rogerio Figueiredo: I'm new to vesc
[2022-12-29T12:33:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: If the hardware and filter isn‚Äôt good , the current will exceed more than max phase current you set. For cheap vesc or just with bad hardware you have always to set like 50A more in abs or you will have error
[2022-12-29T12:39:57] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Check motor detection results. Rededect a few times. Check phase currents and battery currents. Dont go above your actual battery limit by cells. If you set, i.e, 50A battery and you have 16s. Calculate like that: 57.6v √ó 50A = ~2880w . If you want to get thats watts from start. You need atleast 2880 / motor emf generating when riding slow or close to 1-5kmh.. i dunno, 5V maybe? Ok, if 5v, then 2880 / 5 = 576A phase current. Means when battery is produces here 50A at 57.6v (nominal), then you need 576A phase current to get these 2880watts at 5v rotating. You need to know your kv of motor and calculate by yourself. Around like that. Ofc 576A is too much, then you can set 200A. Then you will have 1000watts at 5v generated by motor. The battery peak will be a little bit later then. When you accelerating battery current goes up too.
[2022-12-29T12:40:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: For monorim and 16s its too slow..
[2022-12-29T12:40:39] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: So low kv?
[2022-12-29T12:42:52] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ye, like that
[2022-12-29T12:46:05] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Whats your rpm at freewheel?
[2022-12-29T12:53:24] Rogerio Figueiredo: <photos/photo_7165@29-12-2022_04-28-30.jpg>
[2022-12-29T12:53:36] Rogerio Figueiredo: That is the detection result
[2022-12-29T12:54:53] rosheee: motor is crap
[2022-12-29T12:54:54] rosheee: sry^^'
[2022-12-29T12:55:06] Rogerio Figueiredo: Haha
[2022-12-29T12:55:10] Rogerio Figueiredo: That I know
[2022-12-29T12:55:13] Rogerio Figueiredo: It sucks
[2022-12-29T12:55:58] rosheee: i have vsett for sell
[2022-12-29T12:56:01] rosheee: just redo motor cable
[2022-12-29T12:56:08] rosheee: u can have for 50+ shipping
[2022-12-29T12:56:13] rosheee: but it is used and need new paint
[2022-12-29T12:56:21] rosheee: but give u new SKF bearing
[2022-12-29T12:58:17] Rogerio Figueiredo: Ok
[2022-12-29T12:58:19] Rogerio Figueiredo: Deal
[2022-12-29T12:58:43] Rogerio Figueiredo: I will send you pm
[2022-12-29T13:09:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: Damn, got a BMS cut, don't know what speed I was, BMS said short-circuit protect
[2022-12-29T13:10:00] Face de Pin Suc√©: Turned it on, no short circuit
[2022-12-29T13:10:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: I have to look what the current is setted for short circuit trigger
[2022-12-29T13:10:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: I was logging when it happened, have to look when I'm on computer
[2022-12-29T13:12:16] gil guy: Peak pulse current on phase a start or very low speed is Vbat/Rphasewinding . Measured between 2 phases(star coupling) .Phase current is peak pulse current x duty ..
[2022-12-29T13:20:04] Rogerio Figueiredo: I will share my settings
[2022-12-29T13:30:30] rosheee: u see

[2022-12-29T14:05:24] rosheee: wtf why cut
[2022-12-29T14:05:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: So I told u, it‚Äôs additional current and not max current that can accept for fw. Ur friend Raphael said not :/
[2022-12-29T14:05:50] Face de Pin Suc√©: We don't really know yet
[2022-12-29T14:06:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs just what I see in vesc discord chat
[2022-12-29T14:06:18] rosheee: i set 2x100A battery 2x250A motor max 2x300A max current 2x90A FW
[2022-12-29T14:06:42] rosheee: but set also other shit
[2022-12-29T14:06:50] rosheee: gonna redo jan's cfg now

[2022-12-29T14:07:19] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, one day we will do some tests with same config one motor to see how it affects the battery current
[2022-12-29T14:08:41] rosheee: what is problemeria?
[2022-12-29T14:09:58] rosheee: best would be connect bms to vesc
[2022-12-29T14:10:03] rosheee: gonna do that soon
[2022-12-29T14:10:27] rosheee: idk ^^'

[2022-12-29T14:10:37] rosheee: <sticker>
[2022-12-29T14:11:10] rosheee: but i pull 340A peak when battery warm but very rare
[2022-12-29T14:11:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs open source, you senior developer can check it. I‚Äôm noob unfortunately
[2022-12-29T14:11:37] rosheee: with cold battery 250A cont. 310A peak
[2022-12-29T14:12:31] rosheee: üòÉ
[2022-12-29T14:12:36] rosheee: but i set bms to 380A

[2022-12-29T14:28:50] Gordan Gizdic: 160 phase per motor, 50A x2 battery and 20A per motor FW.
[2022-12-29T14:29:08] Gordan Gizdic: So far the most i got uphill for a few km was 49 degrees.
[2022-12-29T14:29:34] Gordan Gizdic: I can really complain about temps.
[2022-12-29T14:30:08] Gordan Gizdic: So far at 7.2kw max, i havent had a single temp issue. Its 15 degreea outside so in summer, it will go up much more
[2022-12-29T14:46:42] sombre_enfant: If u up the Amps put even more on bms max A setting because if it cut somehow flipsky die

[2022-12-30T18:03:11] Happy Giraffe: Was there a way to make ADC2 act as a throttle? (In vesc tool mobile)
[2022-12-30T18:03:40] Happy Giraffe: I would like to make my dedicated ebrake lever to act as throttle if I snap my chains/break my leg etc.
[2022-12-30T18:04:23] Mirono escooters: Config it as a reverse ebrake and then swap motor direction üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è
[2022-12-30T18:06:20] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_7188@30-12-2022_18-06-20.jpg>
[2022-12-30T18:07:21] Happy Giraffe: Did this "button" option work even if I have a linear throttle? It will act just like max power on/off?
[2022-12-30T18:09:37] Mirono escooters: Problably yes
[2022-12-30T18:10:53] Happy Giraffe: Maybe its like "ACD2 swaps ADC1 thr/brk
[2022-12-30T18:11:25] Happy Giraffe: There seems to be no way to put ADC2 to reverse on its on or act as a throttle
[2022-12-30T18:12:11] rosheee: why?
[2022-12-30T18:12:16] rosheee: adc2 u want throttle?
[2022-12-30T18:13:37] rosheee: u connected it ?
[2022-12-30T18:14:06] rosheee: just recompile FW
[2022-12-30T18:14:07] rosheee: easypeasy
[2022-12-30T18:14:22] rosheee: app_adc.c and change ADC_IND_EXT to ADC_IND_EXT2 on line 124.
[2022-12-30T18:14:24] rosheee: thx
[2022-12-30T18:14:52] rosheee: James da boi maybe can do for u if u suckisucki good
[2022-12-30T18:15:57] Happy Giraffe: There should be just a button in vesc tool mobile to make ADC2 act as throttleüåö
[2022-12-30T18:17:30] Happy Giraffe: My throttle is a torque sensor
[2022-12-30T18:17:43] Happy Giraffe: So if I break my leg or bike chain snaps I cant use it
[2022-12-30T18:18:32] Happy Giraffe: Its bit complicated haha
[2022-12-30T18:18:40] rosheee: ^^
[2022-12-30T18:18:46] rosheee: SPECIAL REQUEST
[2022-12-30T18:19:35] Happy Giraffe: But torque sensor is 3.3v and brake 5v haha
[2022-12-30T18:20:13] Happy Giraffe: I use ADC adapter for the brake and directly connect throttle to 3.3v and AD1üòÇ
[2022-12-30T18:20:30] Happy Giraffe: Havent tested how it would work
[2022-12-30T18:21:01] Happy Giraffe: Its just a generic 5v throttle
[2022-12-30T18:21:34] Happy Giraffe: Yep haha, gotta be legal and natural to pedal the ebike
[2022-12-30T18:22:25] Happy Giraffe: I thought vesc would have a button "swap ADC1 and ADC2 behaviour"
[2022-12-30T18:22:30] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2022-12-30T18:22:37] rosheee: recompile fw much faster
[2022-12-30T18:23:12] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, then I just load new FW, backup settings and go?ü§î
[2022-12-30T18:23:16] rosheee: yes
[2022-12-30T18:23:27] rosheee: and setup input voltrage then xD

[2022-12-30T18:24:59] Happy Giraffe: I gotta update all firmwares first, soldering the cables tomorrow
[2022-12-30T18:25:58] Happy Giraffe: I even need new chainring+chain to even use the torque sensor haha
[2022-12-30T18:27:00] Happy Giraffe: Atm printing box for vesc to mount on bottleholder screws

[2022-12-31T10:10:30] pinkflozd: i have a lot of hills here so it heats a lot, but works perfectly, changed 5 pads in 6k km and that's it

[2022-12-31T10:22:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If i were you and dont want to mess ,just would make sure that fork dont mess oil tube And turns dont stress them And under handlebar you make a loop,while lever remains in normal position it will be good , I mean some ppl think oil brake lvr is ok upside down to change sides but its not actually

[2023-01-02T12:28:30] Konstantin: Can wire, if use only 1 esc, it's useless
[2023-01-02T12:37:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: I know
[2023-01-02T12:37:37] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is just 1 example
[2023-01-02T12:37:54] Rogerio Figueiredo: I wanna have replacement wires if something goes wrong
[2023-01-02T12:42:00] Thierry: https://a.aliexpress.com/_m0Hci0m
[2023-01-02T12:43:42] Rogerio Figueiredo: Does not look the same
[2023-01-02T12:43:57] Rogerio Figueiredo: I want the male that enter in board
[2023-01-02T12:44:51] S1m 0n: I will try this one. I had to order at least 5 PCB's = 10‚Ç¨ with shipping. Arduino Nano 5-6‚Ç¨, display 5-6, buttons 10pcs = 2‚Ç¨
[2023-01-02T12:45:05] Mirono escooters: Cheap enough
[2023-01-02T12:48:41] S1m 0n: Looks like XHB connector. 4 Pin xhb
[2023-01-02T12:49:56] S1m 0n: Is it?
[2023-01-02T12:51:54] S1m 0n: both projects about the same. I ordered several different display sizes
[2023-01-02T12:52:05] Mirono escooters: Nice
[2023-01-02T12:52:11] Mirono escooters: I like the display
[2023-01-02T12:52:40] S1m 0n: 3rd one is a lil bit to small.. 1,3" is not much
[2023-01-02T12:53:19] S1m 0n: First one is to old and will not work anymore
[2023-01-02T12:53:40] S1m 0n: Second one is a upgrade Version from first project

[2023-01-02T12:54:50] S1m 0n: Still don't like the UI and prefer landscape
[2023-01-02T12:54:50] Konstantin: Both with mods
[2023-01-02T12:55:08] S1m 0n: Don't like block style
[2023-01-02T12:55:15] S1m 0n: It's like retro style
[2023-01-02T12:55:24] Konstantin: Landscape if use xxx digital, very small...
[2023-01-02T12:56:14] S1m 0n: yes I can imagine. maybe omit some other values ‚Äã‚Äãfor it. For me, only the kmh and battery display is important
[2023-01-02T12:56:25] Konstantin: For 2 vs 3 digits, I disable battery bar

[2023-01-02T12:57:07] S1m 0n: sounds good, then I know that my idea works in one way or another
[2023-01-02T12:57:10] Konstantin: Small on top, it's esc and motor temp
[2023-01-02T12:57:40] S1m 0n: Nice üòé
[2023-01-02T12:59:02] Konstantin: Test on 2" screen and 2.2"
[2023-01-02T12:59:44] Mirono escooters: It's basic but works
[2023-01-02T12:59:53] Mirono escooters: I am not good w software I dream of making a cool display
[2023-01-02T13:00:49] S1m 0n: Same I ordered üòÖ..also 1,3, 1,6 and 1,8
[2023-01-02T13:01:47] S1m 0n: Also... But my knowledge is enough to make from much code suitable code for me
[2023-01-02T13:02:57] Rogerio Figueiredo: Nop
[2023-01-02T13:03:05] Rogerio Figueiredo: I don't think
[2023-01-02T13:03:14] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is a bit different
[2023-01-02T13:20:46] Mirono escooters: I can't do Not even that
[2023-01-02T13:21:08] Mirono escooters: I'd rlly love to make all hardware and casings for it. But have yet to find someone to make the software with meüôÇ
[2023-01-02T13:28:19] Thierry: 75100 V2, you mean Flipsky?

[2023-01-02T15:25:52] Luis Magalhaes: Any one tested vesc's in original motor of xiaomi?
[2023-01-02T15:29:26] Luis Magalhaes: What's the amps value's you can achive with that shitty motor üòÇ
[2023-01-02T15:29:54] Mirono escooters: Its gonna burn
[2023-01-02T15:30:04] Mirono escooters: 40ish amps and it was at lilit
[2023-01-02T15:30:59] Mirono escooters: Batt
[2023-01-02T15:31:08] Mirono escooters: Xiaomi has 55a phase xD
[2023-01-02T15:31:10] Mirono escooters: Stock esc
[2023-01-02T15:40:23] Luis Magalhaes: @marine_tugah üòÇ
[2023-01-02T15:41:27] Luis Magalhaes: @marine_tugah is having issues with the monorim motor but its same shit 1.2mm2 cables
[2023-01-02T15:42:14] Luis Magalhaes: he said it works normal under 70A motor after that it starts to stutter
[2023-01-02T15:42:45] Luis Magalhaes: the motor have no power at 70A..
[2023-01-02T15:42:53] Luis Magalhaes: need new motor üòÇ
[2023-01-02T15:47:40] Mirono escooters: Monoshit
[2023-01-02T15:50:46] Rogerio Figueiredo: Haha
[2023-01-02T15:50:59] Rogerio Figueiredo: Maybe even gmax stock motor is better then this
[2023-01-02T15:52:55] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse
[2023-01-02T15:54:35] Luis Magalhaes: for that its better to buy a better one
[2023-01-02T15:55:47] Rogerio Figueiredo: It is?
[2023-01-02T15:56:20] Rogerio Figueiredo: Fucks this shit
[2023-01-02T16:06:54] Luis Magalhaes: go for a better one
[2023-01-02T16:29:53] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-01-02T16:30:15] Rogerio Figueiredo: Fuck this then
[2023-01-02T16:30:21] Rogerio Figueiredo: Why people buy this shit
[2023-01-02T16:30:34] Mirono escooters: BCS they are dumb
[2023-01-02T16:30:37] Mirono escooters: And don't know
[2023-01-02T16:39:29] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ye, and battery under 25a at S mode
[2023-01-02T16:39:53] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: So 25-30A battery and 50-70A motor (phase) current is ok for xiaomi motors
[2023-01-02T16:51:55] Mirono escooters: More
[2023-01-02T17:00:13] Mirono escooters: Yes afaik
[2023-01-02T17:00:20] Mirono escooters: It's also build better
[2023-01-02T17:04:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not
[2023-01-02T17:04:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: Both are 30mm
[2023-01-02T17:04:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: But g30 bigger diameter
[2023-01-02T17:15:08] Luis Magalhaes: @marine_tugah buy motor üòÇ
[2023-01-02T17:26:34] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, its same software limits, but motor is stronger
[2023-01-02T17:27:15] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 30mm magnets, bigger diameter and bigger section
[2023-01-02T18:06:46] Rogerio Figueiredo: so the best i can ask for this motor is like 70a phase motor
[2023-01-02T18:07:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: Clearly with bigger stator if number and width of magnet is the same, the height and length is different
[2023-01-02T18:08:22] Rogerio Figueiredo: i putted 45a in battery and tried like 100a in motor
[2023-01-02T18:08:33] Rogerio Figueiredo: on monorim 48v 500w
[2023-01-02T18:08:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: In escooter world we always talk about height because we can‚Äôt make bigger stator for actually rim
[2023-01-02T18:10:41] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Why not. You are limited by motor saturation, section itself and heat time
[2023-01-02T18:16:47] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: The more amps you are pushing, more saturated it gets - more useless amps you get on top (much more heat than torque or useful work and its not linear) But that useful range of motors efficiency is individual to each motor that exist. This information should usually be provided by the manufacturer of this motor as a passport (tested by them and not theoretical info). Like datasheet of mosfet, cells or else.
[2023-01-02T18:29:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I also found some tiny project near vesc

[2023-01-02T18:41:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Not for now Spent too much
[2023-01-02T18:41:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But yeah tell more pls
[2023-01-02T18:42:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: King gt , 250‚Ç¨ both + shipping
[2023-01-02T18:58:26] Rogerio Figueiredo: I never saw that info for this motor
[2023-01-02T19:00:50] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Monorim doesnt have it
[2023-01-02T19:01:03] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: üòÖüòÖ
[2023-01-02T19:01:26] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yeah this is crap
[2023-01-02T19:02:08] Rogerio Figueiredo: <video_file>
[2023-01-02T19:02:35] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is worst then xiaomi esc
[2023-01-02T19:02:55] Rogerio Figueiredo: Or the same
[2023-01-02T19:03:50] rosheee: @rion should do dem tests as well
[2023-01-02T19:04:58] Luis Magalhaes: Why? They have the best scooter üòÇ
[2023-01-02T19:07:57] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: What value did you set in motor poles parameter?
[2023-01-02T19:09:15] Rogerio Figueiredo: I put 30 and 28 and 15
[2023-01-02T19:09:23] Rogerio Figueiredo: I think I tried everything
[2023-01-02T19:09:26] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 30 is the right value
[2023-01-02T19:09:29] Rogerio Figueiredo: Kkk
[2023-01-02T19:09:33] Rogerio Figueiredo: I know
[2023-01-02T19:09:34] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: This is only for speed measure
[2023-01-02T19:09:54] Rogerio Figueiredo: But that is only for telling the right speed right?
[2023-01-02T19:09:58] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes
[2023-01-02T19:10:24] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Looks like something else is wrong
[2023-01-02T19:10:47] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Cause 90A phase and so slow accelerating
[2023-01-02T19:10:58] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Or you ride uphil
[2023-01-02T19:12:15] Rogerio Figueiredo: Not uphill
[2023-01-02T19:12:19] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: That accelerating is ok for smth like 11" high kv big motor
[2023-01-02T19:12:27] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But monorim and xiaomi is small motors
[2023-01-02T19:12:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: This motor is the monorim with hight kv
[2023-01-02T19:12:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Low kv
[2023-01-02T19:12:44] Rogerio Figueiredo: It does 82gos in xiaomi esc and 20s
[2023-01-02T19:13:10] Rogerio Figueiredo: High speed low torwur isn't high kv?
[2023-01-02T19:13:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Monorim has more torque
[2023-01-02T19:13:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Answered next question by did you test engine
[2023-01-02T19:13:31] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Not speed
[2023-01-02T19:13:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: This üëÜ
[2023-01-02T19:13:42] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But, for now maybe its different
[2023-01-02T19:13:50] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I used monorim motors 2-3 years ago
[2023-01-02T19:14:29] Mirono escooters: It's low kv yes
[2023-01-02T19:14:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: For speed 365 replacement high kv beats it
[2023-01-02T19:14:40] Mirono escooters: 350w high af kv
[2023-01-02T19:14:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I think he fucks some settings somehow ü§î
[2023-01-02T19:15:19] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Maybe try to redetect motor settings
[2023-01-02T19:15:26] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Manual
[2023-01-02T19:15:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also 90 phase what did diag say ?
[2023-01-02T19:15:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Not auto
[2023-01-02T19:15:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Good idea
[2023-01-02T19:25:02] Rogerio Figueiredo: This one is low torque high speed
[2023-01-02T19:25:26] Mirono escooters: Then u heated it so much kV changed
[2023-01-02T19:25:36] Mirono escooters: Or well monoshit made a accident
[2023-01-02T19:27:00] Rogerio Figueiredo: The old one had torque this one is speed
[2023-01-02T19:27:39] Rogerio Figueiredo: Nop
[2023-01-02T19:27:49] Rogerio Figueiredo: There are 2 versions of this motor
[2023-01-02T19:28:12] Mirono escooters: Since when
[2023-01-02T19:28:22] Rogerio Figueiredo: One has more torque (old one) one with speed and low torque (new one)
[2023-01-02T19:28:27] Rogerio Figueiredo: Don't know
[2023-01-02T19:28:51] Rogerio Figueiredo: But one group here in Portugal have a lot of this motors and some base torque other have speed
[2023-01-02T19:30:36] Rogerio Figueiredo: They teach me that
[2023-01-02T19:30:41] Rogerio Figueiredo: But I don't know
[2023-01-02T19:30:46] Rogerio Figueiredo: I'm. Just a noob learning
[2023-01-02T19:32:18] Mirono escooters: That would make their business practices even worse
[2023-01-02T19:32:27] Mirono escooters: "yeah we don't know what motor itis, just see. "
[2023-01-02T19:32:46] Mirono escooters: If it turns it's a success -monorim engineer
[2023-01-02T19:34:04] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Lol
[2023-01-02T19:35:26] Rogerio Figueiredo: Hahah
[2023-01-02T19:35:45] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is what they told me
[2023-01-02T19:35:59] Rogerio Figueiredo: And all the new ones have speed and don't have torque
[2023-01-02T19:37:03] Mirono escooters: Eh, it's shit anyway
[2023-01-02T19:39:07] Rogerio Figueiredo: Haha
[2023-01-02T19:39:09] Rogerio Figueiredo: I know
[2023-01-02T19:39:18] Rogerio Figueiredo: But for its what I got
[2023-01-02T19:39:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: I'm just trying to make the best of it
[2023-01-02T19:39:52] Mirono escooters: Fair enough
[2023-01-02T19:40:02] Rogerio Figueiredo: Gmax has gen 1 and gen2 motors and is almost the same
[2023-01-02T19:40:05] Mirono escooters: Ferrofluid it and it takes 1200-1500w. Customer of mine used w 20s
[2023-01-02T19:40:20] Rogerio Figueiredo: Gen 1 has more torque and gen2 more speed
[2023-01-02T19:40:36] Rogerio Figueiredo: My problem is that motor has no power
[2023-01-02T19:41:46] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-01-02T19:41:52] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Hmm, try another motor
[2023-01-02T19:41:52] Mirono escooters: 200a phase and fuck it
[2023-01-02T19:41:58] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yea
[2023-01-02T19:42:00] Mirono escooters: Use 250w Xiaomi xD
[2023-01-02T19:43:24] Luis Magalhaes: 1.2mm square fase cables says everything üòÇ
[2023-01-02T19:43:45] Mirono escooters: Yea
[2023-01-02T19:43:59] Mirono escooters: I pushed 100a through 1.5 and it got hot after , maybe 3? Seconds
[2023-01-02T19:44:05] Luis Magalhaes: @marine_tugah you have to buy new motor no way to go üòÇ
[2023-01-02T19:44:31] Luis Magalhaes: He tried 100A but says he got hot
[2023-01-02T19:44:37] Mirono escooters: Understandable
[2023-01-02T19:44:48] Mirono escooters: I'd donate him a. Motor but I only have shit ones left
[2023-01-02T19:46:27] Luis Magalhaes: üòÇ
[2023-01-02T19:47:39] Mirono escooters: I have a 1200w motor, super nice. But guy drove it on flat and rim isn't cracked, it's just non existent
[2023-01-02T19:54:01] Rogerio Figueiredo: More than 70a phase and start cutting
[2023-01-02T19:54:17] Mirono escooters: Lol how
[2023-01-02T19:54:38] Rogerio Figueiredo: Don't know
[2023-01-02T19:56:31] Rogerio Figueiredo: <video_file>
[2023-01-02T20:45:41] S1m 0n: Are u using Arduino nano (clone), or the recommended Arduino nano every?
[2023-01-02T21:11:40] pinkflozd: i had the same problems, it was due to a missconfigured vesc, i suggest that you start by reflashing the firmware that will reset the settings (don't use the defaults button in vesc tool)
[2023-01-02T21:25:27] Rogerio Figueiredo: What motor do you have?
[2023-01-02T21:25:54] Rogerio Figueiredo: I can flash over Bluetooth with android app?
[2023-01-02T21:27:33] pinkflozd: i had the slow speed monorim, changed motor since then
[2023-01-02T21:28:31] Rogerio Figueiredo: That one has good torque yes?
[2023-01-02T21:31:19] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 100a phase or battery a little bit different thingüòÖ
[2023-01-02T21:31:46] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 100a phase actually not too much for phase
[2023-01-02T21:31:52] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 1.5mmq is good at it
[2023-01-02T21:31:58] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: For pretty long run
[2023-01-02T21:33:51] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Thats actually vesc is doing thing
[2023-01-02T21:34:12] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Need to redetect motor and check your absolute ratings of esc firmware and hardware
[2023-01-02T21:37:08] Mirono escooters: Phase ofcourse
[2023-01-02T21:37:10] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-01-02T21:43:22] pinkflozd: Yea, if we can call it good torque, it just needs a lot of power to move
[2023-01-02T21:46:01] Rogerio Figueiredo: I did a lot of detect

[2023-01-02T21:48:25] Mirono escooters: 70mohm oof
[2023-01-02T21:48:42] Rogerio Figueiredo: What you call a lot of power to move?
[2023-01-02T21:48:51] Mirono escooters: Soo much deviation between 1 2 3 Especially motor lq-ld
[2023-01-02T21:49:27] pinkflozd: i was running 40a battery and 90 phase
[2023-01-02T21:49:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: Hall can fail with high temps
[2023-01-02T21:50:42] pinkflozd: yea that motor heats a lot, i had it filled with ferrofluid
[2023-01-02T21:52:59] Rogerio Figueiredo: Mine didn't get hot
[2023-01-02T21:53:07] Rogerio Figueiredo: Because is cutting
[2023-01-02T21:53:26] Rogerio Figueiredo: And I need to t make more than 1km with it
[2023-01-02T21:53:45] Rogerio Figueiredo: I will try to make 3 in a row to see
[2023-01-02T21:53:54] Rogerio Figueiredo: <video_file>
[2023-01-02T21:53:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: Also if the hall is too cheap and magnetic field is too high
[2023-01-02T21:54:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: But why you still use dis shit?
[2023-01-02T21:54:18] Rogerio Figueiredo: Sorry for the portuguese no the video
[2023-01-02T21:54:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: Get a serious motor and save a lot of time/money
[2023-01-02T21:54:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: Luis translateüòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2023-01-02T21:54:51] Rogerio Figueiredo: I made video for him
[2023-01-02T21:55:18] Rogerio Figueiredo: Basically when I press back on vesc does not go back make a lot of noise
[2023-01-02T21:55:21] Mirono escooters: Lol monorim halls cheap usually fail too
[2023-01-02T21:55:35] Mirono escooters: Wich vesc
[2023-01-02T21:56:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Normal, also controller logic circuit is too poor, my wolf do this too with makerbase, my vesc definitely don‚Äôt do this
[2023-01-02T21:57:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: really a shame, because the power board is really good
[2023-01-02T21:57:46] Rogerio Figueiredo: 75100 V2 makerboard
[2023-01-02T22:01:15] Mirono escooters: Hmm. I use generic Esc now on bike not vesc anymore. Sorry guys Vesc had so much problem w saturation motor and halls reading, this one more current and very smooth
[2023-01-02T22:01:17] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-01-02T22:01:30] Mirono escooters: Just had to have reliable bike ü•≤
[2023-01-02T22:02:34] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Thats not a surprise, check my detection of motors from g30, xiaomi pro and my monorim custom

[2023-01-02T22:06:47] Mirono escooters: Jezus
[2023-01-02T22:10:31] Luis Magalhaes: Its shitty motor can run right üòÇüòÇ
[2023-01-02T22:10:46] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Its pretty accurate by the comparison on one your system
[2023-01-02T22:11:04] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: When you dont use other vescs and fw

[2023-01-02T22:17:22] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-01-02T22:28:40] Rogerio Figueiredo: So you tried allready the monorim motor
[2023-01-02T22:29:40] Rogerio Figueiredo: Why is your monorim custom?
[2023-01-02T22:32:59] Luis Magalhaes: square wave?
[2023-01-02T22:33:05] Mirono escooters: I think so, yes
[2023-01-02T22:33:21] Mirono escooters: But it's silent, when I did bldc on vesc is was waaay louder. Now it's almost foc level
[2023-01-02T22:33:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is this sabvoton?
[2023-01-02T22:33:37] Mirono escooters: But its way aggressive on low speed and pulls infinite amps
[2023-01-02T22:33:45] Mirono escooters: No fuck sabvoton
[2023-01-02T22:33:50] Mirono escooters: This is Chingcang esc
[2023-01-02T22:34:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: I had 2 x sabvoton 72150

[2023-01-02T22:34:15] Luis Magalhaes: yes thats what e see, amps go up on start and then going down üòÅ
[2023-01-02T22:34:17] Mirono escooters: Expensive and overrated garbage
[2023-01-02T22:34:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: Never 350A phase
[2023-01-02T22:34:29] Mirono escooters: Idk what it's tbh,I can't say for sure
[2023-01-02T22:34:33] Luis Magalhaes: 2 bricks
[2023-01-02T22:34:36] Luis Magalhaes: üòÇ
[2023-01-02T22:34:37] Mirono escooters: I think? Bldc. Since sensorless works too
[2023-01-02T22:35:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: Also foc can work sensorless (FOC work only sensorless)
[2023-01-02T22:35:24] Mirono escooters: Yes I know, but for generic ali esc
[2023-01-02T22:35:35] Mirono escooters: Idk I can use a oscilloscope to check at school
[2023-01-02T22:35:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: Real current is same as batt current.
[2023-01-02T22:35:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs likely 200A limited
[2023-01-02T22:36:53] Mirono escooters: For the smart people I have 60v not 48v And I shunted it +33% more current approx
[2023-01-02T22:37:02] Mirono escooters: It won't live long üòèü§£
[2023-01-02T22:37:13] Mirono escooters: I did add thermal paste , it was dry

[2023-01-02T22:37:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: Does it had shunt on phases?
[2023-01-02T22:38:07] Mirono escooters: Uhh, no
[2023-01-02T22:38:13] Mirono escooters: I don't think I should've taken pics
[2023-01-02T22:38:21] Mirono escooters: Only 2 "shunts" aka big copper bars

[2023-01-02T22:40:38] Rogerio Figueiredo: U quit on vesc?
[2023-01-02T22:40:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: FOC only with shunt will work
[2023-01-02T22:40:54] Rogerio Figueiredo: I don't know th difference

[2023-01-02T23:28:48] Mirono escooters: Good upgrade
[2023-01-02T23:28:49] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-01-02T23:31:25] Rogerio Figueiredo: Your test gives 34a on that motor and mine give 70a why so diferent?
[2023-01-02T23:32:14] Rogerio Figueiredo: U don't like suspension
[2023-01-02T23:32:19] Rogerio Figueiredo: üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ

[2023-01-02T23:42:55] Rogerio Figueiredo: It gives 1 aggressive look like it
[2023-01-02T23:44:13] Gordan Gizdic: Its missing flamed to complete the picture.
[2023-01-02T23:44:18] Gordan Gizdic: üòÅ
[2023-01-02T23:44:24] Gordan Gizdic: Flames
[2023-01-02T23:52:37] Jan: That enough power to solder awg8 cables?
[2023-01-02T23:53:22] Mirono escooters: For what do u need so much powa
[2023-01-02T23:53:26] Mirono escooters: To heat room?
[2023-01-03T00:13:00] Gordan Gizdic: Youll melt a hole through a table with that. All the way down to your neighbour.
[2023-01-03T00:13:22] Mirono escooters: Ho much is costs? Maybe nice
[2023-01-03T00:16:01] Jan: About 70$
[2023-01-03T00:17:04] Mirono escooters: Oempf nvm
[2023-01-03T01:01:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: Tip is way too big for solder cables
[2023-01-03T01:44:12] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Because i always using "hub motors" preset (motor size) to load motor when doing auto detection. The load current will be different at different sizes. This parameter on vesc called "max power loss" during detection. In advanced section
[2023-01-03T01:44:54] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: If i choose small inrunner or outrunner - it will give me 100-150A to my motor current during detection
[2023-01-03T01:46:06] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: And it will recommend that current at the end
[2023-01-03T01:46:39] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But this high current dont actually healthy for that motor
[2023-01-03T01:47:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not only
[2023-01-03T01:47:08] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: So i choose always "hub motor" for hub motors like ours scooters or ebikes and after that corrects it if needed
[2023-01-03T01:47:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: Monorim made 2 version motors
[2023-01-03T01:47:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: One high Kv , one low Kv
[2023-01-03T01:47:35] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I know
[2023-01-03T01:47:40] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I had high kv on mine
[2023-01-03T01:47:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: One has very high Kv, 0 torque
[2023-01-03T01:47:45] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I did high kv by myself
[2023-01-03T01:48:19] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But thats true for vesc
[2023-01-03T01:48:44] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: It can do different loads at different max power loss parameter and recommend different currents no matter your motor high/low kv or small/big. If you choose very high number of max power loss, so it can easily just damage motor or esc will blow up
[2023-01-03T01:50:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: Same motor but high kv normally = higher parallels then lower resistance, that also made the detection with more rated current
[2023-01-03T01:50:53] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ofc, it depends
[2023-01-03T01:51:33] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I mean at the same motor
[2023-01-03T01:51:41] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: When you dont change it
[2023-01-03T01:51:51] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Only changing max power loss parameter
[2023-01-03T01:53:52] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes. They are actually airtakes, because under them are escs on both sides
[2023-01-03T01:54:28] Mirono escooters: Same
[2023-01-03T01:54:31] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Inside the deck is only big battery with smart bms. And in bag same battery too
[2023-01-03T01:54:49] Mirono escooters: And why?
[2023-01-03T02:44:06] Rogerio Figueiredo: High kv? What is you max top speed?
[2023-01-03T02:49:01] Rogerio Figueiredo: Because people whant downhill speed
[2023-01-03T03:01:24] Mirono escooters: ü§îüòÜ
[2023-01-03T03:03:52] Rogerio Figueiredo: True
[2023-01-03T03:04:08] Rogerio Figueiredo: I'm fat e need torque
[2023-01-03T03:04:27] Rogerio Figueiredo: Or I will not go uphill
[2023-01-03T10:43:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Would be nice to have a full video of his detect, maybs you right and just miss engine size and that fucks all
[2023-01-03T10:48:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: For this i had 47 a
[2023-01-03T12:14:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Ken Block diedüòí
[2023-01-03T12:35:49] Mirono escooters: Rip
[2023-01-03T12:36:15] Mirono escooters: Man, @AJAJ1992 we need a different g30 group, or atleast filter those bad apples. It went from a healthy nice environment to whatteverthefuck this shit is.
[2023-01-03T12:43:08] Jan: Its the internet, its filled with bad apples everywhere, banning wont do much as you can just join from a different account. I will discuss with roger this week on how we should carry on with the environment of the group
[2023-01-03T12:50:43] Jan: This russian guy has a very extremistic "robin hood" pirate like attitude where copy other's work to make it public is justified. Personally i dont care if he makes my design free use as long as he does not profit on ideas he did not create. But it stops people investing energy into creating new stuff. I will carry on doing designs and ideas but a lot less documented and only reveal details when a product would be already ready to ship
[2023-01-03T12:58:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well would be nice to decide, what will happen
[2023-01-03T12:58:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Just copy of Jans clearly
[2023-01-03T12:59:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Can be differences but maily it is ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-01-03T13:00:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also i would ban that guy month's ago lucky him i have no rights there
[2023-01-03T13:01:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: For me it doesnt matter, he could design his own but this was more easy for him probably
[2023-01-03T13:03:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And when some ppl gives a shit about the other it's not ok ,he could say hey Jan i am pretty good at this , can i redesign and sell here ? Not just throw trash copy in
[2023-01-03T13:03:51] Mirono escooters: Lol me too
[2023-01-03T13:04:03] Mirono escooters: I have too little patience to be admin
[2023-01-03T13:04:14] Jan: Thats an important point
[2023-01-03T13:04:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: For me it's not About Russians at all , asshole= ban
[2023-01-03T13:04:26] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse
[2023-01-03T13:04:34] Mirono escooters: No race related
[2023-01-03T13:04:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Dont think doesnt mean no at allüòÖ
[2023-01-03T13:04:41] Jan: Always stay zen üôèüòÇ
[2023-01-03T13:05:11] Mirono escooters: It's hard
[2023-01-03T13:05:41] Jan: His open source argument is valid and not predatory, however its the same with movie piracy
[2023-01-03T13:05:46] Mirono escooters: They are everywhere and always Ready to go bukake But I don't feel attacked, I like Laughting at em
[2023-01-03T13:05:57] Jan: If everyone pirates movies, nobody will produce movies anymore
[2023-01-03T13:06:02] Mirono escooters: Totally correct
[2023-01-03T13:06:59] Jan: However im also ok if people get a trash copy of Avatar 2 filmed in the cinema while i could enjoy in 3D imax for 30$
[2023-01-03T13:07:07] Jan: ü§∑
[2023-01-03T13:07:13] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-01-03T13:08:28] Mirono escooters: Problem is differences in culture. Mostly. Hope this won't sound bad, I don't mean it But in the old sovjiet regions, communism still lives. Mainly the idea of sharing and everything is for everyone. We here have way more "mine mine mine" mindset, and everything is personal and from yourself. It's just a matter of cultural differences, and you can't discuss that. It's just how you have been raised
[2023-01-03T13:09:20] Jan: Communism works great as many examples have shown in the past 100yearsüëå /s
[2023-01-03T13:10:11] Mirono escooters: It works at School, when someone made the assignment üòä
[2023-01-03T13:10:31] Mirono escooters: No, that's just the flaw with communism
[2023-01-03T13:10:54] Mirono escooters: You always end up with someone taking power . The concept is super. But it never works out
[2023-01-03T13:11:08] Mirono escooters: I did a mini study on it and why it fails. ITs very interesting
[2023-01-03T13:12:13] Mirono escooters: The problem is, capitalism motivates to innovate and work hard With communism, no one has any motivation, reason to work, and everyone has the same on paper. But behind walls, people take power and differentiate themselves from the rest. It's just a human flaw. If it was a robot system, its actually a good system ü§£
[2023-01-03T13:12:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I would say the idea of marks,is like you say ,but ppl are assholes
[2023-01-03T13:12:29] Mirono escooters: Yes. Humans are the weak point. Again
[2023-01-03T13:12:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: WTF

[2023-01-03T13:13:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And somehow ended up like this
[2023-01-03T13:13:50] Mirono escooters: Adhd be a cool drug, sorry back to vesc
[2023-01-03T13:13:54] Mirono escooters: When 500a mp2?
[2023-01-03T13:15:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: One thing comes from another,you are not alone with lets say not liking the poison
[2023-01-03T13:15:39] Mirono escooters: XD hoerai
[2023-01-03T13:16:00] Mirono escooters: Today I plan to bolt mp2 and finally do real tests
[2023-01-03T13:16:10] Mirono escooters: But the French beat me to it anyway
[2023-01-03T13:28:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Beat all in something else
[2023-01-03T13:29:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Dont cry me boyüòÅüòé
[2023-01-03T13:32:51] Mirono escooters: They just too good to beat
[2023-01-03T13:33:06] Mirono escooters: Maybe once I get me bike
[2023-01-03T14:08:54] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: On 20s was around 80kmh on flat. 10" and heavy modified xiaomi escs with xiaodash without fw
[2023-01-03T14:27:00] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Its just the matter of how you protect it in digital way. But telegram doesnt have any author rights moments, so everyone can copy whatever they want and do whatever they want until the authorities or the police will not intervene. Absolutely everything that was posted in the telegram can be absolutely safely copied, plagiarized, etc., if it is not protected by copyright at the level of a patent and legal rights
[2023-01-03T14:27:59] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: So here's a simple rule - if you don't want someone to copy something, don't distribute it until there's a patent or copyright protection
[2023-01-03T14:28:09] Mirono escooters: Patent is abit over our head
[2023-01-03T14:44:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Bro you are younger, Now you have x knowledge, compare that with what you gain till his age , i mean if you were his age you would have more experience also ,so heads up
[2023-01-03T14:45:01] Jan: Well is this the way now how we should proceed in this community? Patents & Lawsuits?
[2023-01-03T14:47:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I dont think so Thats needed on this lvl ,but respecting Others and there work is
[2023-01-03T14:48:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: My main problem is, guy is an asshole and if you let ppl like him grow on your head will not lead to any good ,for sure
[2023-01-03T14:49:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: He could start the whole thing different and non would be pissed mad etc and now we have confusion together while he laugh in his hand
[2023-01-03T14:50:02] Mirono escooters: Never
[2023-01-03T14:52:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: It's like Rs said there, community builds by helping Others and for me feels shit if i think about the hours Jan spent with drawing thinking etc I hate work for no reason and than some other try to flex by being a copycat
[2023-01-03T14:55:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: in a conversation with Jan i told him i will try to make a fender from metal and near this i told that a friend of mine wants his
[2023-01-03T14:56:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Welcome

[2023-01-03T14:57:58] íà≤íçΩ: Are there any diy vesc esc ?
[2023-01-03T15:01:06] íà≤íçΩ: It‚Äôs very big board for high Amp , I‚Äôm looking for something smaller
[2023-01-03T15:03:42] íà≤íçΩ: Better quality then Chinese
[2023-01-03T15:03:59] íà≤íçΩ: Are they max 60 Amps ?
[2023-01-03T15:04:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Define needs
[2023-01-03T15:05:17] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Lol, its small and high amps
[2023-01-03T15:05:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Smallest flipsky 13s max 70a phase
[2023-01-03T15:05:32] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You can do up to 30s and 100a battery with it
[2023-01-03T15:05:39] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Cmon
[2023-01-03T15:05:58] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: No other sizes like that, maybe cl350 only
[2023-01-03T15:06:23] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Then its good to go
[2023-01-03T15:06:41] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ye
[2023-01-03T15:07:36] sombre_enfant: Copy fs75100
[2023-01-03T15:08:13] íà≤íçΩ: From original author ?
[2023-01-03T15:08:46] íà≤íçΩ: I thought it‚Äôs beta project
[2023-01-03T15:09:12] íà≤íçΩ: His final design is commercial project
[2023-01-03T15:09:55] Mirono escooters: Only 100a battery? Way more
[2023-01-03T15:10:14] sombre_enfant: No from flipsky so cheap and small
[2023-01-03T15:10:23] Mirono escooters: Ez 250a
[2023-01-03T15:11:10] Mirono escooters: Yes, if we include cooling
[2023-01-03T15:11:17] Mirono escooters: But most run 20s and then ezpz 250a
[2023-01-03T15:12:22] íà≤íçΩ: Also there is no firmware for mp2 stmf407 version
[2023-01-03T15:13:47] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: With 30s - its probably phase only
[2023-01-03T15:13:49] íà≤íçΩ: Compile by your self
[2023-01-03T15:13:49] Mirono escooters: Stmf407?
[2023-01-03T15:13:55] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 250a batt and 30s is way harder
[2023-01-03T15:14:03] Mirono escooters: Yes 30sü§∑
[2023-01-03T15:14:10] íà≤íçΩ: But this is hard for me
[2023-01-03T15:14:17] Mirono escooters: For bike I wanted 30s but then my kV would be super mismatched
[2023-01-03T15:14:28] Mirono escooters: We already have precompiled fwü§®
[2023-01-03T15:14:51] íà≤íçΩ: So the best way is to make mp2 design board with only 6 fets also decreased size
[2023-01-03T15:15:29] íà≤íçΩ: Is it in smart esc public ?
[2023-01-03T15:15:31] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Get xiaomi esc and modify it
[2023-01-03T15:16:01] íà≤íçΩ: It doesn‚Äôt have CAN
[2023-01-03T15:16:06] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ye
[2023-01-03T15:16:25] Mirono escooters: Mp2 group
[2023-01-03T15:16:32] Mirono escooters: Smart Esc is a different esc
[2023-01-03T15:17:21] íà≤íçΩ: I know , but only in this group I can read info about mp2
[2023-01-03T15:17:33] íà≤íçΩ: Is there special group for mp2 ?
[2023-01-03T15:18:21] íà≤íçΩ: This one only

[2023-01-03T22:21:56] Mirono escooters: I wanna add another battery but I virtually have no space left
[2023-01-03T22:22:10] rosheee: which scooter?

[2023-01-04T00:04:21] Mirono escooters: I need to lean alot
[2023-01-04T00:04:32] Mirono escooters: I'd add more battery but my frame lacks space
[2023-01-04T00:20:53] Mirono escooters: I can always add a small lipo pack to help with the current surges, but that's, less then Optimal
[2023-01-04T00:29:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Get bigger frame like orange 73
[2023-01-04T00:30:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: That fits whole e car battery ü§£
[2023-01-04T00:31:33] Mirono escooters: I've already ordered stealth bomber
[2023-01-04T00:31:43] Mirono escooters: But for now this is what I have to do with and make reliable for when that comes

[2023-01-04T11:45:52] Rogerio Figueiredo: Hello guys I am trying a gmax motor of my friend
[2023-01-04T11:47:24] Rogerio Figueiredo: I'm using without halls and wheen I make full throttle when stopped starts cutting
[2023-01-04T13:07:10] Mirono escooters: Yeah u cant start from 0 without halls xD
[2023-01-04T13:37:13] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is not from 0 is from 2 haha
[2023-01-04T13:37:25] Mirono escooters: Still
[2023-01-04T13:37:33] Rogerio Figueiredo: My friend has a motor that start from 0 with no halls
[2023-01-04T13:37:51] Mirono escooters: Magic
[2023-01-04T13:38:09] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is true I saw it
[2023-01-04T13:38:17] Jan: Thats like: Please press the button every time when the green light shows up. But i give you a blind fold. Thats without hall
[2023-01-04T13:38:34] Jan: from how i understood it
[2023-01-04T13:38:57] Jan: The motor has no idea how it is oriented and how to apply the field
[2023-01-04T13:39:13] Mirono escooters: Yes. It just guessed and hopes its correct
[2023-01-04T13:39:30] Mirono escooters: Once rolling it uses the feedback system of voltage to drive it
[2023-01-04T13:39:37] Mirono escooters: Very nice explanation
[2023-01-04T13:49:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 1) He doesnt know that he uses halls. 2) No halls, but he calls from "zero", although in fact he repels a little and does not actually start from really zero and stand position 3) He uses new HFI algorithm in vesc software. It can starts smoooth from zero now.

[2023-01-04T13:49:39] Mirono escooters: Does hfi work as well as halls?
[2023-01-04T13:49:49] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Exactly better than halls
[2023-01-04T13:50:02] Mirono escooters: I'm the old grumpy white man who is like "Gr gr, i only wanna use halls. Nothing else."
[2023-01-04T13:50:11] Mirono escooters: How come
[2023-01-04T13:50:22] Mirono escooters: There must be some downside,no?
[2023-01-04T13:50:38] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Looking at vedders tests - no ahah

[2023-01-04T15:09:50] Mirono escooters: I want snow to build thzt
[2023-01-04T15:10:40] Mirono escooters: I wish
[2023-01-04T15:31:16] Rogerio Figueiredo: It does not start from zero but gives a little kick only
[2023-01-04T15:31:42] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse
[2023-01-04T15:33:46] Rogerio Figueiredo: What is hfi?
[2023-01-04T15:38:12] Rogerio Figueiredo: Ok
[2023-01-04T15:38:22] Rogerio Figueiredo: What is the best config to do that
[2023-01-04T15:45:01] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: It works with every hub motor without sensors, doesnt matter
[2023-01-04T15:47:24] Rogerio Figueiredo: Anyone tried and can share settings?
[2023-01-04T15:52:05] Mirono escooters: So if we have halls Use halls or hfi?
[2023-01-04T15:53:23] Rogerio Figueiredo: I guess you need to try and see
[2023-01-04T15:53:42] Mirono escooters: Eh halls
[2023-01-04T15:55:27] Rogerio Figueiredo: I don't have the connector for halls
[2023-01-04T15:55:58] Rogerio Figueiredo: I will try it in my g30
[2023-01-04T15:56:06] Rogerio Figueiredo: To see if makes difference
[2023-01-04T15:56:23] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse will
[2023-01-04T16:41:56] Elsass Rider: hello everyone üëã. small question, this vesc supports 84v max? thank you üôÇ
[2023-01-04T16:42:19] Mirono escooters: The 100v one does
[2023-01-04T16:42:46] Tommy: No, max 75vüò¨
[2023-01-04T16:43:06] Tommy: Maax 18s
[2023-01-04T16:44:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: 17s max safe
[2023-01-04T16:49:27] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 17s max safe without ebrake
[2023-01-04T16:49:37] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 16s safe with middle ebrake
[2023-01-04T16:50:23] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: It must not exceed above 80v from back emf
[2023-01-04T16:50:57] Elsass Rider: Thank you all üëçüèº üôÇ
[2023-01-04T16:51:41] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: The black one (100v) is safe up to 22s. But 22s without ebrake, maybe a little bit, but not too much. 20s with ebrake easy
[2023-01-04T16:54:00] Elsass Rider: so if I want to spend one day on a 72v battery I should therefore go to the 100v. being currently in 60v it will also be fine
[2023-01-04T16:54:32] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, if 20s, then 100v black one
[2023-01-04T16:55:07] Elsass Rider: Top top üëçüèº
[2023-01-04T17:32:16] Gordan Gizdic: Uboxes come in 3 flavors. Speaking about doubles. Red one has bit better fets for more current and that one is dodgy at 18s. Purple aka J version has a bit worse fets but can take 18s easily and ofc black one rated at 100v. Main difference between red and purple is that red can take a bit more current and heats up a bit less. Purple does just a bit worse in that department but can go safely to 18s because it uses 100V fets
[2023-01-04T17:33:07] Gordan Gizdic: <photos/photo_7258@04-01-2023_17-33-07.jpg>
[2023-01-04T17:34:32] Gordan Gizdic: I pushed mine to 65x2 batt amps and 150 phase amps today. Almost 8k club. If the packs were over 70 percent on charge, i would see 8k easily. No overheating issues. Max temo was 49 degrees at 15degrees outside temp.
[2023-01-04T17:34:54] Gordan Gizdic: Yeah... My head is killing me. üò≠üôà
[2023-01-04T17:46:50] Elsass Rider: OK, thanks. what material would you recommend? I start üòä

[2023-01-04T17:53:30] Elsass Rider: okay. currently in 60v but I would like to switch to a 72v battery. So I'm lost now with what you just said. would you have a vesc to advise me?
[2023-01-04T17:54:11] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: ubox dual 100v
[2023-01-04T17:54:40] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: right now its not ready to ride, but i used earlier 5.2 and 5.3

[2023-01-04T17:55:01] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: i use no limits version
[2023-01-04T17:55:46] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: i didnt use more than 130A phase and 70a battery yet on that
[2023-01-04T17:56:05] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: each
[2023-01-04T17:56:17] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: front is less ofc

[2023-01-05T12:16:05] Luis Magalhaes: @PaoloWu do you even have any torque with those motors and low amps?
[2023-01-05T12:17:20] Luis Magalhaes: Wolf dropout is shit üòÇ and to modify the front is another shit because of the front suspension mounts had yo change
[2023-01-05T12:18:06] Luis Magalhaes: Not impossible but should have new cnc parts or something

[2023-01-05T12:43:39] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-01-05T12:43:41] Mirono escooters: Hopefully
[2023-01-05T12:45:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: Stock one hall don‚Äôt works
[2023-01-05T12:49:19] Luis Magalhaes: Hum ok in that case those work better üòú, but that has torque with those settings?
[2023-01-05T12:52:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt know , no tested yet
[2023-01-05T12:52:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: But stock axle fit better

[2023-01-05T17:02:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: I‚Äôve stick welding included in my tig machine, but idk anything about stick welding lol
[2023-01-05T17:02:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Anyway older type of machines are weak an sucks to weld they rarely give you stabil amount of power ,most of them for rutil sticks , basically does are for dot holdings, than you finalise with basic sticks
[2023-01-05T17:02:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: Tig is easier
[2023-01-05T17:02:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Mig is the easyest
[2023-01-05T17:03:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Tig is pretty similar to soldering for me
[2023-01-05T17:03:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: metal splatters too much
[2023-01-05T17:03:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: With mig

[2023-01-05T17:03:35] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-01-05T17:03:37] Mirono escooters: It's handy
[2023-01-05T17:04:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So you have an inverter type , that's easy for you on iron stuff with 4616 or er21
[2023-01-05T17:04:06] Mirono escooters: Stick is ezpz
[2023-01-05T17:04:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: Problem I‚Äôve no iron to weld ahhaah

[2023-01-05T17:07:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt have picture, much time I don‚Äôt weld. Since it‚Äôs too much powerful for my home electrical network
[2023-01-05T17:07:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Can be True
[2023-01-05T17:07:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: Clean them lol

[2023-01-05T17:14:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: How much you want in this ?
[2023-01-05T17:14:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: Maybe 5L - 10L remain ?
[2023-01-05T17:14:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt know how is big
[2023-01-05T17:15:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Coz its almost full ,they load it in kg
[2023-01-05T17:15:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: Oh, so you don‚Äôt use standard bottle
[2023-01-05T17:15:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: This is like hip size high near your body
[2023-01-05T17:15:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because normally we get with 200Bar bottle
[2023-01-05T17:16:19] S1m 0n: we have other pressure reducers, but if the needle is that low, it's enough for at least 3-4 working days. since i only work 4 days a week.. a week
[2023-01-05T17:16:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Nah gas here is up to a time and you rent the "bottle"
[2023-01-05T17:16:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: We weld mostly car stuff
[2023-01-05T17:16:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So much less used
[2023-01-05T17:17:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Big one would be half full when time is up and you have to take it back to change
[2023-01-05T17:17:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: They give you in time windows when there is must return number, doesnt matter if you only welded once
[2023-01-05T17:18:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Goverments new law cant own the bottles üòí
[2023-01-05T17:18:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: More gas you can have anytime
[2023-01-05T17:18:35] S1m 0n: we make fuel pump and electrical cabinets. Nothing special, I could weld that without certificates.. is actually just put together and then welded
[2023-01-05T17:18:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Thickness?
[2023-01-05T17:19:10] S1m 0n: Under 5mm üòÑ

[2023-01-05T17:19:59] rosheee: Verymuch
[2023-01-05T17:20:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And you weld in cars you can do just spots , long weld would burn over
[2023-01-05T17:20:21] rosheee: Answer pm pms
[2023-01-05T17:20:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Imagine that again

[2023-01-05T17:20:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You take your porche to a body shop and they tin broken part?üòÖ
[2023-01-05T17:22:41] S1m 0n: With how much Amps u weld?
[2023-01-05T17:25:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Depends on car body shape 60-80
[2023-01-05T17:28:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You cant use more and still if Ou replaceme a rotten piece what you cut out you dont know how good is the left over part
[2023-01-05T17:28:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Maybe you need to cut more just to avoid rothing come back
[2023-01-05T17:29:31] S1m 0n: ok, so you like it a little hotter too üòÑ.. I was told about 45 per millimeter.
[2023-01-05T17:29:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Than you go around the new piece
[2023-01-05T17:30:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: School tells different than rl

[2023-01-05T17:31:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: He said dont fear the amps , if you do repair and not just new better bit overscore
[2023-01-05T17:32:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But you do lot dots cant go in a line ,would move piece and your car loses shape
[2023-01-05T17:32:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And there is Always after fun ,if its not an older car ,kinda sure
[2023-01-05T17:33:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Coz you touch around sanded weld alls good
[2023-01-05T17:33:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: 20 cm near blob blob you push metal in coz of heat took molecules
[2023-01-05T17:34:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Than you take flame and give dot heats and get steckly ,the right type of shape and start hammering to move molecules back üòÖ
[2023-01-05T17:35:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: While you dot heat and give cold sponge when done
[2023-01-05T17:35:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: This type of hammer only
[2023-01-05T17:37:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Steckly
[2023-01-05T17:38:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But these less needet at 5mm thickness
[2023-01-05T17:56:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Welcome
[2023-01-05T20:09:09] S1m 0n: at my work that would be "botch" .. our parts have to be radiation-proof. it's all just build-up welding, but I'd also be happy about a bit of diversity and trying out new things @Her0DasH
[2023-01-05T20:27:45] Dinis Neto: Hello I'm waterproofing my scooter and I have some doubts about motor waterproofing. My scooter is a blade GT+ and motors are 1500w nominal power. I don't know the brand of motors. If I put silicone on entry of cable on motor and and some grease on axis near the bearings you think should be enough for waterproof.??
[2023-01-05T20:27:57] Dinis Neto: <photos/photo_7269@05-01-2023_20-27-57.jpg>
[2023-01-05T20:27:58] Dinis Neto: <photos/photo_7270@05-01-2023_20-27-58.jpg>
[2023-01-05T20:27:58] Dinis Neto: Or the only way to guarantee waterproof is doing this: https://youtu.be/B0JeeSEO_oI
[2023-01-05T21:38:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I worked lot diffent places ,in metal world biggest place we made train and bridge parts ,i was doing plasma cutting but not by handüòÖ 2* 6m*12m tables , feeling was like terminator two
[2023-01-05T21:39:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Next to us flame cutter guys had gloves ,that you could hold melt ironüòÅ
[2023-01-05T21:40:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Unsure what you mean radiaton proof
[2023-01-05T21:41:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: From that word also plasma cutter comes up in my head
[2023-01-05T21:42:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: It had huge vacum system to take burn smell and all ,every month we had to open collecting box thing ,you get out a closed box , what's not to interesting,till you dont see side üòÖ
[2023-01-05T21:43:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Radioactive marking on it üòÖ
[2023-01-05T21:44:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well you need to open it for sure
[2023-01-05T21:44:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If cap not sealed no reasons to do so
[2023-01-05T21:45:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If Bearings are not new never add extra oil or grease on them ,doesnt help
[2023-01-05T21:45:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Engine cable also should be glued inside already
[2023-01-05T21:47:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Here what you is not even the beairng it looks like extra rubber cap to avoid dust
[2023-01-05T21:49:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also this partly tells things but didn't take time to watch all
[2023-01-05T21:49:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: When removes cap i almost diedü§£
[2023-01-05T21:52:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Uses fancy bearing puller, than other side he forces it and than realizes spring there ,anybody who ever done similar pulls that up ,no other way ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ i dunno the guy but doenst look experienced ,i would say watch more to collect best for your self
[2023-01-05T21:53:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also one sided Engine would not require,just cap off
[2023-01-05T21:54:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: This red shit sprays Another time me deadüòÖ
[2023-01-05T21:57:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Say welcome to heat mr isolation spray ,you can be 1000% sure that doesnt help heat to get out from engine
[2023-01-05T21:59:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Would be fun to see open that crap after a month of use , probably you find redish puke inside
[2023-01-05T21:59:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So normaly not all engine is like this ,but have smal xiaomi open
[2023-01-05T22:00:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Full with 704 silicone
[2023-01-05T22:01:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also you can use that for cap waterproofing only tiny layer, rest comes out or goes in as you tighen bolts
[2023-01-05T22:02:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also if you have an old Engine with like 1500 km would change Bearings while its open
[2023-01-05T22:03:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also to open a piece of wood and wise is enough usually, that Bearings puller what he shows from brancho is $$$ ü§£

[2023-01-05T22:08:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I wear water and windproof stuff so basically i am ok too ,but damn how annoying to self clean helmet glass to seeüòÖ
[2023-01-05T22:09:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And anytime i get in rain like that ,i am middle of nowhere,so no place to hide or do a trick
[2023-01-05T22:11:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But in the past when biking was even worst, in your way you get wet by sweating on the way home you get in rain that even your shoes needs two days to dry

[2023-01-05T22:14:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well that's true depends who mounted it and how
[2023-01-05T22:14:45] S1m 0n: Radiation safe means that the workpieces are x-rayed and inspected for inclusions or bonding defects...I'm not sure what kind of company I work for...main job is painting. But we also produce housings for fuel pumps, electric boxes and decoder housings (stainless steel or vending machine steel). At the same time we also produce armor for BMW. This means that the plates are cut out by laser, assembled by BMW and then returned to us for painting.
[2023-01-05T22:14:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like if you have loose housing you use bearing glue
[2023-01-05T22:15:10] Mirono escooters: With China, don't assume
[2023-01-05T22:15:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You Always add grease on axis

[2023-01-05T22:28:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But basically i would say toy lvl whole I mean when you put bearing in something whats professional made ,you hear bearing and wall cry as you press with the press,you never hear this in a scooter

[2023-01-07T19:28:16] Mirko Boni: Today I did a test of battery-operated led lights, the photos are taken with the mirroless in manual mode so as not to leave the choice to the camera's exposure meter. From what I could see, the Chinese led light has more power in the center, while the other two illuminate better at the edges and slightly less in the center. Unfortunately, it is not easy to direct the light beam to the same spot in all three photos

[2023-01-07T20:09:13] Martin Kaktits: light look pretty similar to me, even tho lamps themselves massively different sizes and led count
[2023-01-07T20:10:26] Mirko Boni: But look closely, the olights are able to illuminate the edges better ..
[2023-01-07T20:10:48] Mirko Boni: The olight 2000 because it illuminates the edges better
[2023-01-07T20:12:02] Martin Kaktits: well now I look closer I can see that edges are little better yes, I guess. Still all pretty decent. But idk, i have shit little light now so all look better üòÜ

[2023-01-07T20:31:28] Mirko Boni: Your fault you don't want to sell your light
[2023-01-07T20:31:44] Mirko Boni: You are right
[2023-01-07T20:31:52] Jan: My light is no high beam for night drive
[2023-01-07T20:32:00] Jan: Its a day drive visibility light
[2023-01-07T20:32:21] Martin Kaktits: what about battery tho
[2023-01-07T20:32:25] Mirko Boni: Ahh ok ok.. I thought it was a light to light up the dark road
[2023-01-07T20:32:30] Jan: No
[2023-01-07T20:32:37] Mirono escooters: That's my problem, w ordering china lamps . Don't know what tto trust. Even A rating is off I'll probably diy my own with custom lens
[2023-01-07T20:32:48] Mirono escooters: Id just hookup to internal one
[2023-01-07T20:33:08] Martin Kaktits: then why pay for battery powered one :D
[2023-01-07T20:33:31] Mirko Boni: I bought osram lights at a huge cost, but the result is just enough
[2023-01-07T20:33:43] Mirono escooters: I have such a "faren" lamp for looking far. It's ok But wide angle lamps are rarely findable. I ordered one, plastic casing and 2-3W Useless, that is
[2023-01-07T20:34:09] Mirko Boni: OSRAM LEDriving ROUND VX80-WD, fari di profondit√† a LED per illuminazione a campo vicino / a distanza ravvicinata, ampio, 1150 lumen, fascio luminoso fino a 240 m, faretto LED 12V / 24V https://amzn.eu/d/7ucHaa5
[2023-01-07T20:34:12] Mirono escooters: Problably diy is solution. Idk if I can make it good thoü§î Have yet to find reliable china seller
[2023-01-07T20:34:18] Mirono escooters: I dont
[2023-01-07T20:34:25] Mirono escooters: Yes for example
[2023-01-07T20:34:33] Mirono escooters: For on bike
[2023-01-07T20:35:04] Mirko Boni: Exactly.. Good in depth but non-existent as a wide angle!
[2023-01-07T20:35:14] Mirono escooters: Why it looks like dat
[2023-01-07T20:35:27] Mirono escooters: Not super no, that's burned and fibreglass sleeves handle quite alot of temp
[2023-01-07T20:35:36] Mirono escooters: Seems like bad soldering joint
[2023-01-07T20:35:50] Mirono escooters: Same problem, glad I'm not alone
[2023-01-07T20:35:58] Mirono escooters: Works and good is different
[2023-01-07T20:36:14] Mirono escooters: Still bad contact
[2023-01-07T20:36:15] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-01-07T20:36:18] Mirono escooters: Resolder
[2023-01-07T20:36:31] Mirono escooters: Yes defo
[2023-01-07T20:36:48] Mirono escooters: Think I'll do school project nice lamp, I'll cnc a heatsink casing
[2023-01-07T20:37:15] Mirono escooters: Star point
[2023-01-07T20:45:36] Gordan Gizdic: Not completely buz its on its way to be fucked
[2023-01-07T20:45:48] Gordan Gizdic: A bit darker and it would start to fall off.
[2023-01-07T20:45:56] Mirono escooters: Bad
[2023-01-07T20:46:09] Gordan Gizdic: Thats a connection between coils?
[2023-01-07T20:46:15] Gordan Gizdic: Seems pretty bad tbh.
[2023-01-07T20:46:37] Gordan Gizdic: Hmmm.. would re do it.
[2023-01-07T20:46:55] Gordan Gizdic: Scrape of the lacquer and solder properly.
[2023-01-07T20:47:18] Gordan Gizdic: Thats not the motors fault, its pure hu an lazyness.
[2023-01-07T20:47:31] Gordan Gizdic: Human*
[2023-01-07T20:48:14] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2023-01-07T20:49:15] Gordan Gizdic: Told you. Your motor is assembled by a moron.
[2023-01-07T20:49:19] Mirono escooters: Ieuw
[2023-01-07T20:49:22] Mirono escooters: Thats crap
[2023-01-07T20:49:40] Gordan Gizdic: You do that.
[2023-01-07T20:49:42] Gordan Gizdic: Yes.
[2023-01-07T20:50:00] Gordan Gizdic: And take a torch, burn off lacquer and solder properly
[2023-01-07T20:50:25] Gordan Gizdic: Torch and wire brush. Done in a munute.
[2023-01-07T20:50:51] Gordan Gizdic: Yeah, what. Lacquer burns off and residue you sort with brush.
[2023-01-07T20:53:44] rosheee: i send him idk
[2023-01-07T20:54:12] rosheee: maybe he just playing
[2023-01-07T20:54:14] rosheee: or drunk
[2023-01-07T20:54:15] rosheee: idk xD
[2023-01-07T20:58:30] rosheee: <photos/photo_7378@07-01-2023_20-58-30.jpg>
[2023-01-07T20:58:37] rosheee: i dunnio believe xD
[2023-01-07T21:00:05] Jan: Following his business manifesto
[2023-01-07T21:00:13] Jan: Promise then never deliver üëå
[2023-01-07T21:00:18] Jan: Maybe ü§∑
[2023-01-07T21:00:20] Jan: Lets see
[2023-01-07T21:05:06] rosheee: ^^'
[2023-01-07T21:05:12] rosheee: he said 250R he can send this weekend
[2023-01-07T21:05:20] rosheee: then he was like 2x250R + 2x250
[2023-01-07T21:05:23] rosheee: now 4x250
[2023-01-07T21:05:29] rosheee: if he rly send ^^'
[2023-01-07T21:05:45] rosheee: then rion boost +10 posts ^^'
[2023-01-07T21:10:39] rosheee: <photos/photo_7379@07-01-2023_21-10-39.jpg>
[2023-01-07T21:10:48] rosheee: <sticker>
[2023-01-07T21:13:35] Jan: Oh i think he gets pushed to make thing right now
[2023-01-07T21:38:10] Gordan Gizdic: Better do it.
[2023-01-07T21:38:33] Gordan Gizdic: Its lazy and wrong.
[2023-01-07T21:38:49] Gordan Gizdic: Yeah, will do very soon.
[2023-01-07T21:38:54] Gordan Gizdic: Atm cant move.
[2023-01-07T21:38:57] Gordan Gizdic: Soooo tired.
[2023-01-07T21:39:16] Gordan Gizdic: <photos/photo_7380@07-01-2023_21-39-16.jpg>
[2023-01-07T21:39:23] Gordan Gizdic: I look like this atm.
[2023-01-07T21:39:29] Gordan Gizdic: And feel like shit.
[2023-01-07T21:40:20] Gordan Gizdic: Resistance will drop, redo motor detection.
[2023-01-07T21:40:25] Gordan Gizdic: Im fucking curious.
[2023-01-07T21:41:06] Gordan Gizdic: 30mohm was what i got last time. Im wondering if youll get lower value.
[2023-01-07T21:43:48] Gordan Gizdic: Wll it did its job.
[2023-01-07T21:44:00] Gordan Gizdic: You cant complain about that.
[2023-01-07T21:44:54] Mirono escooters: Yes way to little solfer
[2023-01-07T21:46:16] Gordan Gizdic: Got another one?
[2023-01-07T22:03:37] Konstantin: They always die fast... 30k rpm to much;)
[2023-01-07T22:19:29] Gordan Gizdic: Ahahaha
[2023-01-07T22:19:47] Gordan Gizdic: Yup, should have put a cover over it. üòÇ
[2023-01-07T22:21:17] Gordan Gizdic: Picture?
[2023-01-07T22:22:21] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It is customizable, it has a few features more than VESC does.
[2023-01-07T22:23:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well basically if you happy you shut up ü§£
[2023-01-07T22:23:07] Gordan Gizdic: Honestly, your soldering iron is not hot enough.
[2023-01-07T22:23:26] Gordan Gizdic: Those dont look that great. Not a lot of penetration.
[2023-01-07T22:23:47] Gordan Gizdic: Solder should have soaked in between the wires.
[2023-01-07T22:23:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I mean you will post shit out off them if not ,with the burnt ones üòÅ
[2023-01-07T22:24:18] Gordan Gizdic: I mean its 10x better than stock.
[2023-01-07T22:24:31] Gordan Gizdic: Did you do motor detection?
[2023-01-07T22:25:32] Gordan Gizdic: Argh, it will do for now.
[2023-01-07T22:25:37] Gordan Gizdic: Much better than stock.
[2023-01-07T22:26:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yes
[2023-01-07T22:27:02] Gordan Gizdic: It could be.
[2023-01-07T22:27:07] rosheee: xD?
[2023-01-07T22:27:14] Gordan Gizdic: Do you have your old motor detection values?
[2023-01-07T22:27:28] Gordan Gizdic: Im curious.
[2023-01-07T22:27:41] Gordan Gizdic: I got 30 and 31mohm on my motors.
[2023-01-07T22:28:00] rosheee: told ya
[2023-01-07T22:28:00] rosheee: xD
[2023-01-07T22:30:32] rosheee: ^^
[2023-01-07T23:06:10] Luis Magalhaes: Had similar problem on my front motor, still heats more then the rear one, have to reopen to check again
[2023-01-07T23:06:31] rosheee: we fixed now
[2023-01-07T23:09:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: How to explain ü§î
[2023-01-07T23:09:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Basically it has to sit in the magnet gaps ,to improve field But at you case its convex now, that's why everything is messy
[2023-01-07T23:10:19] rosheee: now g00d
[2023-01-07T23:12:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Looks better
[2023-01-07T23:13:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But try to ovethink what i said
[2023-01-07T23:13:08] Mirono escooters: Gud
[2023-01-07T23:13:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: When gap filled improve field
[2023-01-07T23:13:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If more, its even resistance
[2023-01-07T23:16:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Gap filling is for, without it air sits there whats even worse and keeps heat a lot ,coz with every spin you force that air in the gaps So basically all you do is fill gaps , so that air is not gaining heat there and this forces caps to get more heat
[2023-01-07T23:16:33] rosheee: he has also a lot on strator
[2023-01-07T23:18:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: He can clean that ,but yeah
[2023-01-07T23:19:20] rosheee: nah
[2023-01-07T23:19:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What you mean nah
[2023-01-07T23:21:00] rosheee: it is good now :D
[2023-01-07T23:21:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: It will be not a place where you can eat from ,but your hand should not be brown from it
[2023-01-07T23:22:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Ohh
[2023-01-07T23:28:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Single tg had upgrade's?
[2023-01-07T23:28:39] rosheee: ?
[2023-01-07T23:28:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Plus has some ,unsure single has it
[2023-01-07T23:29:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like if i draw on pics,i could change line size and such
[2023-01-07T23:30:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Show you
[2023-01-07T23:31:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I can even wash parts out
[2023-01-07T23:31:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And than spoiler the pics
[2023-01-07T23:32:11] rosheee: ?
[2023-01-07T23:32:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You simple pics ?
[2023-01-07T23:33:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Before you touch it should not see

[2023-01-07T23:38:19] rosheee: oh shit
[2023-01-07T23:38:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: I love it
[2023-01-07T23:40:52] Mirono escooters: That's so shit
[2023-01-07T23:44:54] Mirono escooters: ü§®
[2023-01-07T23:46:02] Mirono escooters: üò¨
[2023-01-08T00:01:53] Gordan Gizdic: How can anyone be so fucked in the head to do such a shitty job? That solder is doing nothing, justa dead weight there waiting to detach and cause issues.
[2023-01-08T00:01:56] Gordan Gizdic: My god.
[2023-01-08T00:04:56] Mirono escooters: Glad he opened his
[2023-01-08T00:05:08] Mirono escooters: Rlly bad quality. Wich shop? To avoid it
[2023-01-08T00:13:06] sombre_enfant: Huameng
[2023-01-08T00:15:52] rosheee: XD never had that bad vsett motor
[2023-01-08T01:02:53] Gordan Gizdic: Ill check them. As soon as i find some time to do it properly.
[2023-01-08T01:04:13] Gordan Gizdic: Ah, mine is 2022.
[2023-01-08T01:04:20] Gordan Gizdic: I hope they are better.
[2023-01-08T01:04:33] Gordan Gizdic: But internal resistance... Im wondering about that.
[2023-01-08T01:04:44] Gordan Gizdic: Would like to see what you get.
[2023-01-08T01:04:54] Gordan Gizdic: And yeah, mine seem to run colder?
[2023-01-08T01:04:56] Gordan Gizdic: Idk...
[2023-01-08T01:15:14] Gordan Gizdic: Outrunner.
[2023-01-08T01:15:21] Gordan Gizdic: Why ebike?
[2023-01-08T01:15:26] rosheee: because motor weight
[2023-01-08T01:15:44] Gordan Gizdic: Ok but ebike hub motor is larger in diameter.
[2023-01-08T01:15:54] Gordan Gizdic: Different torque values?
[2023-01-08T01:15:56] Gordan Gizdic: No?
[2023-01-08T01:16:05] rosheee: u can choose diameter ^^
[2023-01-08T01:17:24] Gordan Gizdic: I know but still. Escoot motors have smaller diameter than ebike motors. Shouldnt that fuck up some measurements?
[2023-01-08T01:17:39] Gordan Gizdic: I mean, i could be wrong pfc.
[2023-01-08T01:17:48] Gordan Gizdic: Im going with logic here.
[2023-01-08T01:17:49] rosheee: i check tomorrow
[2023-01-08T01:17:56] rosheee: but worked bad on jan's motor
[2023-01-08T01:17:58] rosheee: and less topspeed
[2023-01-08T01:18:01] rosheee: more resistance
[2023-01-08T01:18:06] rosheee: but only on vsett
[2023-01-08T01:18:10] rosheee: sry more resistance
[2023-01-08T01:18:26] Gordan Gizdic: So to redo motor config with ebike hub motors?
[2023-01-08T01:18:46] Gordan Gizdic: Could be why im seeing less top speed than i saw with stock controller?
[2023-01-08T01:18:53] Gordan Gizdic: Never thought of that.
[2023-01-08T01:21:57] Mirono escooters: Bldc lil higher topspeed then Foc
[2023-01-08T01:23:19] Gordan Gizdic: Huh?
[2023-01-08T01:23:41] Gordan Gizdic: You wanted to say that bldc does hifher top speed than foc?
[2023-01-08T01:23:46] Gordan Gizdic: Yeah, could be.
[2023-01-08T01:23:46] Mirono escooters: A little. Yes
[2023-01-08T01:23:52] Gordan Gizdic: Makes sense.
[2023-01-08T01:23:56] Mirono escooters: And most china scoot controllers are bldc
[2023-01-08T01:24:00] Mirono escooters: That's why I said
[2023-01-08T01:24:23] Gordan Gizdic: Stock vsett is bldc. I know that. I mean, its not a big difference.. like 2kmh.
[2023-01-08T01:24:41] Gordan Gizdic: I dont even care about top speed, i mostly drive 50-60kmh.
[2023-01-08T01:25:00] Mirono escooters: Yes it's defenitely that then
[2023-01-08T01:25:13] Mirono escooters: Foc is way better and the 2kmh is nothing compared to using bldc xD
[2023-01-08T01:29:29] Gordan Gizdic: I agree.. completely. I can also compensate with FW but i find that FW kinda useless on 16s systems.
[2023-01-08T01:30:03] Gordan Gizdic: Not much gain for a lot of current and if things go bad, rhey will go bad fast and with a vengence. üòÇ
[2023-01-08T01:32:39] Mirono escooters: Yeah
[2023-01-08T01:32:42] Mirono escooters: I got 16s too
[2023-01-08T01:32:46] Mirono escooters: Better just go 20s xD
[2023-01-08T01:33:19] rosheee: Why lol
[2023-01-08T01:33:34] rosheee: Had 100kmh with FW
[2023-01-08T01:33:42] Gordan Gizdic: I tested it, not much gain.
[2023-01-08T01:33:51] Gordan Gizdic: Vsett motors are not high kv.
[2023-01-08T01:33:56] rosheee: Yes
[2023-01-08T01:34:01] rosheee: But 20kmh more
[2023-01-08T01:34:02] Gordan Gizdic: With no FW, i got 71kmh.
[2023-01-08T01:34:06] rosheee: 20S 117kmh
[2023-01-08T01:34:09] rosheee: Vsett motors
[2023-01-08T01:34:19] Gordan Gizdic: With 20A per motor i got lile 75-76
[2023-01-08T01:34:33] rosheee: What settings u use?
[2023-01-08T01:34:46] Gordan Gizdic: 50A battery, 20A FW per motor.
[2023-01-08T01:34:56] Gordan Gizdic: Now im 65A batt and no FW
[2023-01-08T01:35:02] rosheee: 70A battery 135A motor 180a max 55A FW
[2023-01-08T01:35:12] rosheee: Front 55A battery 40A FW
[2023-01-08T01:35:21] Gordan Gizdic: Yeah, i dont have those current available. üòò
[2023-01-08T01:35:30] rosheee: 16S5P 50G
[2023-01-08T01:35:38] Gordan Gizdic: Two stock packs.
[2023-01-08T01:35:50] rosheee: Still works
[2023-01-08T01:36:14] Gordan Gizdic: I feel that with FW, it gains speed but slowly. Accel drops dradtically.
[2023-01-08T01:36:27] Gordan Gizdic: And i just dont care about 5kmh more top speed.
[2023-01-08T01:36:59] Gordan Gizdic: I mostly drive in town. So top speed is not needed or needed very rarely.
[2023-01-08T01:37:07] Gordan Gizdic: But i do have a lot of hills.
[2023-01-08T01:37:18] Gordan Gizdic: And more accel work better in those cases
[2023-01-08T01:37:35] rosheee: FW also more accel.
[2023-01-08T01:37:45] rosheee: What duty u set?
[2023-01-08T01:37:49] rosheee: When kicks in?
[2023-01-08T01:38:02] Gordan Gizdic: 90
[2023-01-08T01:38:05] Gordan Gizdic: Stock values.
[2023-01-08T01:38:20] Gordan Gizdic: Maybe im doing it wrong? üòä
[2023-01-08T01:39:07] Gordan Gizdic: I had 140 phase, 50batt and 20FW. 99percent as maks duty, fw starts at 90 percent
[2023-01-08T01:39:16] rosheee: XD why 99% duty
[2023-01-08T01:39:20] Gordan Gizdic: Couldnt tell any difference.
[2023-01-08T01:39:34] Gordan Gizdic: Idk. Because im noob thats still learning. üòÇ
[2023-01-08T01:40:05] rosheee: Set 97% duty max Rear FW 87.5 or 89.5 and front 93%
[2023-01-08T01:40:21] rosheee: If kickes in same time then drains more amps
[2023-01-08T01:40:37] rosheee: Alao set throttle to natural and +25%
[2023-01-08T01:40:57] Gordan Gizdic: +25? Where?
[2023-01-08T01:41:00] Gordan Gizdic: Why?
[2023-01-08T02:00:34] rosheee: adc throttle curve
[2023-01-08T02:00:41] rosheee: app config -> adc
[2023-01-08T02:00:54] rosheee: on vesc u use throttle
[2023-01-08T02:42:28] Rogerio Figueiredo: Hi there
[2023-01-08T02:42:46] Rogerio Figueiredo: Any one use macbook to connect via Bluetooth with vesc?
[2023-01-08T02:42:51] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is closing the app
[2023-01-08T02:42:55] Rogerio Figueiredo: Don't know why
[2023-01-08T02:44:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_7387@08-01-2023_02-44-59.jpg>
[2023-01-08T02:45:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: Got it
[2023-01-08T02:58:10] Mirono escooters: Why keep buying mks?
[2023-01-08T03:12:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Cheaper xd
[2023-01-08T03:12:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: Same board, but cheaper
[2023-01-08T03:12:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, quality worse but can be fixed
[2023-01-08T03:15:12] Mirono escooters: Yeah u said quality differences
[2023-01-08T03:15:19] Mirono escooters: Pls show and tell wich upgrades
[2023-01-08T03:16:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: Use thermal pad instead thermal paste
[2023-01-08T03:16:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: Reinforce joint from wire to track
[2023-01-08T03:17:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: Can don‚Äôt work
[2023-01-08T03:20:48] Mirono escooters: Why pad '
[2023-01-08T03:20:50] Mirono escooters: No can?
[2023-01-08T03:23:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: Pad better for irregular surfaces
[2023-01-08T03:23:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, unfortunately all board I have, CAN don‚Äôt work
[2023-01-08T03:23:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: Flipsky‚Äôs work
[2023-01-08T03:23:43] Mirono escooters: How come. Know why?
[2023-01-08T03:24:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think they used random components
[2023-01-08T03:24:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: I can‚Äôt see full circuit because two boards are soldered
[2023-01-08T03:26:49] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-01-08T03:26:56] Mirono escooters: Safety
[2023-01-08T03:27:03] Mirono escooters: Why cheap out so much if they just do random shit
[2023-01-08T03:28:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2023-01-08T03:29:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: They applied just one point of thermal paste, and the one they use is very cheap, more cheaper than the one I have
[2023-01-08T03:29:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: Its mixed with water ü§£
[2023-01-08T03:29:26] Mirono escooters: UwU
[2023-01-08T08:15:14] pinkflozd: is it worth ugrading to a vesc with phase filters? i have a flipsky 75100, it's working ok for now
[2023-01-08T12:43:48] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-01-08T13:10:44] Rogerio Figueiredo: The 75100 vs also has problem in quality?
[2023-01-08T13:10:50] Rogerio Figueiredo: I change the termal paste
[2023-01-08T13:11:07] Mirono escooters: It's fine
[2023-01-08T13:14:12] Rogerio Figueiredo: I have the makerboard brand in my 75100 V2
[2023-01-08T13:14:30] Rogerio Figueiredo: But I don't have that mutch power
[2023-01-08T13:14:37] Rogerio Figueiredo: I never saw getting hot
[2023-01-08T13:14:56] Rogerio Figueiredo: Only user 55a max in battery and 100a in fase
[2023-01-08T13:15:32] Mirono escooters: Thats fine
[2023-01-08T14:10:14] Konstantin: For roscheeee, water protection;)

[2023-01-08T14:52:23] Rogerio Figueiredo: How do I do that sir?
[2023-01-08T14:55:00] Rogerio Figueiredo: Thank you I will try it
[2023-01-08T14:55:20] Mirono escooters: Sure
[2023-01-08T14:57:11] Mirono escooters: Ubox pretty sealed already but yeah do it
[2023-01-08T14:57:14] Mirono escooters: Still seal scooter good
[2023-01-08T14:58:39] Gordan Gizdic: Why not? Itll wash it properly. I mean you gotta do it once in a while.
[2023-01-08T14:58:42] Gordan Gizdic: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-01-08T15:02:24] Mirono escooters: Well more is always better
[2023-01-08T15:02:29] Mirono escooters: It's like plan B, backup
[2023-01-08T20:39:22] FrizerSeb: good evening, I just installed flipsky 75100 but I have the 75300 hardware and the application does not offer me the 75100 how can I do?
[2023-01-08T20:42:34] Thierry: Just had the same problem, I manually use an old beta firmware that I compiled in the past then upgrade to official 6.0
[2023-01-08T20:44:26] FrizerSeb: I managed to flash the 6.0 to have the lisp but not the good boot I only have the 75300 selectable
[2023-01-08T20:47:09] FrizerSeb: Thks
[2023-01-08T21:20:23] Thierry: I still have a beta firmware, I don't know if it is possible to flash with final 6.0 but I can send it to you if you want
[2023-01-08T22:14:17] Luis Magalhaes: Dam im going to put fire to the wolf üòÇ
[2023-01-08T22:14:52] Luis Magalhaes: Had front motor getting hotter then the rear, today i open the motor clean and ressolder all
[2023-01-08T22:14:57] Luis Magalhaes: Conections
[2023-01-08T22:15:27] Luis Magalhaes: But the motor is rubbing somewhere, i think thats what's causing it to be hotter
[2023-01-08T22:31:48] rosheee: Gordan xD ur FW settings are pretty strange
[2023-01-08T22:32:18] rosheee: And idk if u know what u are set
[2023-01-08T22:32:21] rosheee: <sticker>
[2023-01-08T22:56:58] Gordan Gizdic: Trust me, i dont know also. üòÇ
[2023-01-08T23:14:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Call it experimental settings
[2023-01-08T23:20:12] Gordan Gizdic: I call it idk settings but im trying. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-01-08T23:39:57] Rogerio Figueiredo: Guys when you put 60a in field weakening is battery amps or fase amps?
[2023-01-08T23:40:13] Rogerio Figueiredo: Sorry for so many noob questions
[2023-01-08T23:40:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: Both
[2023-01-08T23:41:16] Rogerio Figueiredo: Both?
[2023-01-08T23:41:39] Rogerio Figueiredo: I have 45a in battery 120a phase and then I put 60a on field weakening
[2023-01-08T23:41:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: When field weakening start is more or less when motor reached max rpm that can do, then controller already pushing max voltage. When you reach max rpm per you voltage, battery will be same as motor current
[2023-01-08T23:54:03] Rogerio Figueiredo: So if I put 6a one field weakening how do I know how mutch mote battery amps will be asking to battery?
[2023-01-09T01:51:26] Rogerio Figueiredo: How can I calculate that?
[2023-01-09T01:51:35] Rogerio Figueiredo: Can you teach me?
[2023-01-09T01:52:12] Mirono escooters: Bro, it's just + whatever u put
[2023-01-09T01:52:15] Mirono escooters: It's no rocket science
[2023-01-09T02:17:37] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Maybe try to set battery amps - check rt data, record it or write down the values on sheet. Then add FW, then record again. Compareü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-01-09T02:18:10] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: This analyzing is pretty interesting sometimes
[2023-01-09T03:19:47] Rogerio Figueiredo: Ok o will try that out tomorrow if don't rain
[2023-01-09T06:45:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: Quality alu is way good
[2023-01-09T06:58:53] sombre_enfant: Si tu met le dernier enleve les phase philter
[2023-01-09T07:12:32] Thierry: Better to check but it is disabled by default in vesc tool 6.00
[2023-01-09T10:57:14] Rogerio Figueiredo: I'm using the 75100 v2 with Ali pcb makerboard brand I just change the thermal paste I don't have dual motor and the temperature is really nice for now I don't have all the power you have
[2023-01-09T10:57:35] Rogerio Figueiredo: The can port not work in makerboard?
[2023-01-09T12:05:10] Konstantin: Daly+llt mix of both:) Hope, not today enjoying to roscheeee club xD
[2023-01-09T15:04:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: @roscheeee maybe survive üòÇüòÇ
[2023-01-09T16:18:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Do you know which failed ,can you show the type
[2023-01-09T16:21:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Probably crap, any before accident you may know?
[2023-01-09T16:21:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also you find similars a lot just dont go cheap
[2023-01-09T16:23:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Why
[2023-01-09T16:24:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Lot fuel bikes have same sizeing,steel exists
[2023-01-09T16:24:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Titanium even better
[2023-01-09T16:24:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But as Paolo said good alum√≠nium never fails till you dont fell with it
[2023-01-09T16:33:21] Mirono escooters: Alot of stress on it
[2023-01-09T16:42:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Hard to compare this with true dh
[2023-01-09T16:43:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I mean in dh ,you change whole frame every year ,not coz of anything broke ,just till end of the season its full with micro cracks

[2023-01-09T16:57:40] Mirono escooters: Maybe 12v died
[2023-01-09T16:58:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And i Guess power source is not the problem,just to keep all facts out asking
[2023-01-09T16:58:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Before I forget, Search monty brand handlebar James
[2023-01-09T16:58:28] Mirono escooters: Reasonable question. If batt shutted off..
[2023-01-09T16:58:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yes that's a good brand
[2023-01-09T16:58:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: They even have some carbon stuff
[2023-01-09T16:59:24] FrizerSeb: and I have no continuity between the power supply and the phases
[2023-01-09T16:59:29] FrizerSeb: Bms jk
[2023-01-09T16:59:55] Mirono escooters: That's normal
[2023-01-09T17:00:08] Mirono escooters: Measure resistance between + and - And between the phases for me pls
[2023-01-09T17:00:12] FrizerSeb: Moss ok
[2023-01-09T17:02:02] FrizerSeb: 373 kohms
[2023-01-09T17:02:20] Mirono escooters: Between + and -?
[2023-01-09T17:02:28] FrizerSeb: Yes
[2023-01-09T17:03:34] Mirono escooters: Is ok
[2023-01-09T17:23:07] FrizerSeb: it went out when the speed limit of 25kmh was reached, wouldn't it be the fact of having put 0 batt regen and 0 regen phases?
[2023-01-09T17:23:53] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-01-09T17:31:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like if you would make this from a dc powersupply you would setup like that ,nowhere to regen in that case
[2023-01-09T17:55:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Nippon

[2023-01-09T20:14:04] Mauro Christian: in blc mode it is better but it seems to me as if it has incorrect currents
[2023-01-09T20:14:37] Mauro Christian: in foc mode it gives me how to download about 1A
[2023-01-09T20:15:14] Mauro Christian: when I accelerate

[2023-01-09T20:22:38] Mauro Christian: ok as soon as I can I make the screen, but what can it be?
[2023-01-09T20:23:34] Mirono escooters: Start w bAsics first
[2023-01-09T20:23:39] Mirono escooters: Too little info to know
[2023-01-09T20:24:23] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Wrong motor foc tuning (flip didnt do best every time when tuning) and/or low currents set at currents tab. Need screens
[2023-01-09T20:32:42] Gordan Gizdic: Guys. Webshop in europe where i can order 25k NTC that works good with vesc? Dont wanna do china shit, something proven and good. Thnx.
[2023-01-09T20:33:02] Mirono escooters: Amazon?
[2023-01-09T20:33:16] Mirono escooters: It's a thermistor. It's not like china can fuck it up that much.
[2023-01-09T20:33:19] Gordan Gizdic: Doesnt deliver anymore to this shitty country.
[2023-01-09T20:33:27] Mirono escooters: Ah

[2023-01-10T14:46:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Maybe i had but more like few First series of v2
[2023-01-10T14:47:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: For that i said probably
[2023-01-10T14:47:14] Rogerio Figueiredo: Or only the v2
[2023-01-10T14:47:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Two of you tried two fails

[2023-01-10T14:48:38] Rogerio Figueiredo: But I had bought 1 flypksy 75100 v1 and a makerbase 75100 v1
[2023-01-10T14:48:47] Rogerio Figueiredo: And try to connect the 2 together
[2023-01-10T14:48:49] Rogerio Figueiredo: Hehe
[2023-01-10T14:48:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: On pics you see named 2 but actually 1 shunt so not v2 tricky
[2023-01-10T14:49:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well i am not totally sure if that can ever work
[2023-01-10T14:50:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: An easy explain would sound bad ü§î they dont talk one language coz they both made in China

[2023-01-10T15:57:29] Mauro Christian: it is the first time that I try to install a vesc
[2023-01-10T15:57:38] Gordan Gizdic: Is the physicall 100 percent throttle same as the electrical.
[2023-01-10T15:57:48] Mauro Christian: i really have no experience
[2023-01-10T15:57:50] Gordan Gizdic: Did you calibrate throttle input?
[2023-01-10T15:58:44] Mauro Christian: yes by doing it from the configuration
[2023-01-10T15:59:09] Mauro Christian: on setup input
[2023-01-10T15:59:46] Gordan Gizdic: Ok. And whats the top speed you get?
[2023-01-10T16:00:10] Mauro Christian: I would get it as close to full speed as possible
[2023-01-10T16:00:40] Mauro Christian: I don't know I should try it
[2023-01-10T16:00:54] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Actually kugoo motor 500w and 14s - 40-45kmh is ok
[2023-01-10T16:01:10] Mauro Christian: <photos/photo_7416@10-01-2023_16-01-10.jpg>
[2023-01-10T16:01:52] Mauro Christian: I also have the ninebot engine
[2023-01-10T16:02:08] Mauro Christian: 40/45 with the original
[2023-01-10T16:02:10] Mauro Christian: realy
[2023-01-10T16:02:31] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Its also ok
[2023-01-10T16:02:44] Mauro Christian: with normal controller
[2023-01-10T16:02:49] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: There is such parameter as kv of a motor
[2023-01-10T16:02:54] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Its constant value
[2023-01-10T16:03:42] Mauro Christian: ok but how do i get the best ? of the speed
[2023-01-10T16:03:45] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ninebot engine can do 40-45 with 14s and kugoo motor also can do 40-45 if kv the same, but torque will be different because of sizes
[2023-01-10T16:04:12] Mauro Christian: oooooooooook
[2023-01-10T16:04:44] Mauro Christian: how do i get a smoother acceleration?
[2023-01-10T16:05:20] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Turn down phase amps or press throttle smoother, not to max position instantly
[2023-01-10T16:05:31] Mauro Christian: anyway thanks guys if i owe you something for this help no problem
[2023-01-10T16:06:03] Mauro Christian: where if i can?
[2023-01-10T16:06:31] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Phase amps in motor current tab
[2023-01-10T16:07:06] Mauro Christian: <photos/photo_7417@10-01-2023_16-07-06.jpg>
[2023-01-10T16:07:09] Mauro Christian: right?
[2023-01-10T16:07:21] Mauro Christian: max current scale
[2023-01-10T16:07:30] Mauro Christian: ?
[2023-01-10T16:12:22] Mauro Christian: ????
[2023-01-10T16:16:48] Mirono escooters: Man, calm down
[2023-01-10T16:17:04] Mirono escooters: We are not paid to help, nor are we 24/7 online
[2023-01-10T16:17:48] Mauro Christian: i'm not running realy
[2023-01-10T16:18:38] Mauro Christian: and as I said that if I have to pay it also seems right to me since you are helping me a lot
[2023-01-10T16:35:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_7418@10-01-2023_16-35-16.jpg>
[2023-01-10T16:35:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Vsett motor resistance through 2 phase

[2023-01-10T16:37:49] Mirono escooters: These seem ok
[2023-01-10T16:38:19] Mirono escooters: Redo motor calibration and show
[2023-01-10T16:38:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I am just showing difference to him mate
[2023-01-10T16:38:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: Same method, but different accuracy
[2023-01-10T16:39:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you measure with vesc, it can return you much different values
[2023-01-10T16:39:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: With this tool you can measure 100 times and return you same value
[2023-01-10T16:39:42] Mauro Christian: <photos/photo_7421@10-01-2023_16-39-42.jpg>
[2023-01-10T16:40:31] Mirono escooters: All is fine :/
[2023-01-10T16:40:40] Mirono escooters: What are the problems with scoot? I can't read 100+ msg
[2023-01-10T16:41:39] Mauro Christian: I would like it to go faster
[2023-01-10T16:41:54] Mirono escooters: How fast goes now
[2023-01-10T16:43:30] Mauro Christian: from the new vesc program it shows me 35km
[2023-01-10T16:44:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Just asking, you think he did motor wizard?
[2023-01-10T16:44:18] Mirono escooters: Wich setup, send more info
[2023-01-10T16:44:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I think -100 is a lot
[2023-01-10T16:44:37] Mirono escooters: If in air same speed as on ground, you are at limit of of battery voltage and kv
[2023-01-10T16:44:41] Mirono escooters: Is fine
[2023-01-10T16:44:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Its a lot
[2023-01-10T16:45:09] Mauro Christian: ok
[2023-01-10T16:45:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also sadly as i said you dont get further with this engine mate
[2023-01-10T16:46:06] Mirono escooters: It's fine
[2023-01-10T16:46:07] Mauro Christian: ok then I put a more powerful engine
[2023-01-10T16:46:15] Mirono escooters: Esc handles it, motor too
[2023-01-10T16:46:22] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I think yea
[2023-01-10T16:46:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I tried also before, a customer had it ,kinda same setup At the end of the day before build done changed to other Engine coz all was weak
[2023-01-10T16:46:25] Mirono escooters: And is only short time, when u ride slow ebrake
[2023-01-10T16:46:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Too much brake power
[2023-01-10T16:46:50] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But all 3 phases are short circuited
[2023-01-10T16:46:57] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: On all motors
[2023-01-10T16:47:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I never added same power to brake and for acceleration
[2023-01-10T16:47:07] Mirono escooters: Eh, diff opinions
[2023-01-10T16:47:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: On any esc
[2023-01-10T16:47:20] Mirono escooters: I did more brake then accel, hehe
[2023-01-10T16:48:05] Mauro Christian: so it can't go any further than this right?
[2023-01-10T16:48:37] Mirono escooters: Not recommended on smol motor
[2023-01-10T16:48:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If you mean faster and more power the answer is no
[2023-01-10T16:48:43] Mauro Christian: thank you all guys
[2023-01-10T16:48:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Sorry for telling kinda bad news
[2023-01-10T16:49:06] Mauro Christian: oooooooook
[2023-01-10T16:49:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If you make your mind up, there is ppl in this chat selling powerfull Engine's
[2023-01-10T16:49:50] Mauro Christian: and if I put the engine in BLC mode?
[2023-01-10T16:50:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Some say you would get a bit more speed but brrrrr sound all time also , doesnt help
[2023-01-10T16:50:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You need higher w rated Engine to gain more
[2023-01-10T16:51:17] Mauro Christian: ooooooooook
[2023-01-10T16:54:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: @PaoloWu maybe i find a new pics for your sticker pack, a real beauty
[2023-01-10T16:54:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: <photos/photo_7422@10-01-2023_16-54-30.jpg>
[2023-01-10T16:54:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: ü§£ü§£ü§£ with additional V brake's üòÖ
[2023-01-10T16:56:40] Mauro Christian: Is not normal
[2023-01-10T16:57:19] Mirono escooters: Foc
[2023-01-10T16:57:36] Mirono escooters: What
[2023-01-10T16:58:10] Mauro Christian: Accelleration
[2023-01-10T17:02:08] Mirono escooters: Why not
[2023-01-10T17:03:48] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Omg, this motor has flashbacks from vietnam
[2023-01-10T17:04:08] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Best
[2023-01-10T17:04:12] Mirono escooters: Ah woops, had to turn sound on
[2023-01-10T17:04:45] Mauro Christian: hahahahhahaahhahahahaa
[2023-01-10T17:13:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, but vesc calculated resistance is total resistance / 2 then = resistance of one phase
[2023-01-10T17:14:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Surly not üòÖ
[2023-01-10T17:16:13] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ye
[2023-01-10T17:22:40] Gordan Gizdic: Yeah but its here where you make the biggest mistake. This tool measures only resistance while vesc does it under some load and takes into account resistance and linductance and capacitance so you should, in theory, get much more accurate real resistance readouts than what ohm meter measures.
[2023-01-10T17:26:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: We talking about resistance , not other parameters. And this parameter make you idea of how much A you can put as maximum to avoid motor burn.
[2023-01-10T17:27:24] Mirono escooters: Conclusion: alot
[2023-01-10T17:27:48] Gordan Gizdic: Still, current flow sees all of the resistance components not just one. And when you spin the motor, it actually gets wors.
[2023-01-10T17:27:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: 28mR one (14mR) can push up to 300A peak
[2023-01-10T17:28:03] Mirono escooters: Ez
[2023-01-10T17:28:07] Mirono escooters: Idk what qs273 is
[2023-01-10T17:30:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: Resistance of copper winding is one only, others aren‚Äôt material resistance. The second law of ohm is one only, it don‚Äôt take care about other parameters. And yes again , I‚Äôm talking about resistance, ONLY WINDING RESISTANCE.
[2023-01-10T18:38:45] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Btw lonn yo told me they can do 80mm solid magnets, not separated in two on line
[2023-01-10T18:38:56] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I think that should be better
[2023-01-10T18:40:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, but hot cheap
[2023-01-10T19:09:01] Mauro Christian: how do i activate the bluetooth module?
[2023-01-10T19:09:10] Mauro Christian: on vesc
[2023-01-10T19:09:56] Mirono escooters: In settings use adc and UART setting
[2023-01-10T19:11:15] Mauro Christian: okay but how?
[2023-01-10T19:11:27] Mauro Christian: <photos/photo_7423@10-01-2023_19-11-27.jpg>
[2023-01-10T19:12:23] Mirono escooters: Settings lol
[2023-01-10T19:12:35] Mirono escooters: General somewhere idk from head
[2023-01-11T10:10:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: @PaoloWu Do you know Gordon motor 60v?
[2023-01-11T10:10:58] Gordan Gizdic: Huh?
[2023-01-11T10:33:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Its a name or it should be
[2023-01-11T10:33:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: We have no change knowing it
[2023-01-11T10:34:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: üòÖ
[2023-01-11T23:16:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: That's hoameng, as he said but Yeah i mean like that
[2023-01-11T23:17:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What?
[2023-01-11T23:18:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Ohhh
[2023-01-11T23:18:28] Gordan Gizdic: Approximately wide enough to fit a 1.2kg chicken and a toothpick. Yeah, that should do it. üòÇ
[2023-01-11T23:20:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I need to measure other things for you,but i have scooter with a mantis motor
[2023-01-11T23:20:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I can measure that but i am not there
[2023-01-11T23:21:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So can do tomorrow
[2023-01-11T23:21:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Np probs
[2023-01-11T23:22:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: We put that in navee s65 frame,so i just have one till saturday
[2023-01-11T23:23:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Bug me tomorrow like 12-14 i will do it
[2023-01-11T23:23:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Lets say
[2023-01-11T23:24:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I think there is atleast 1 washer inside of fork
[2023-01-11T23:24:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: /side
[2023-01-11T23:25:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also brake adapter needs modify coz its far than also just small shitty brakes would sit on it
[2023-01-11T23:25:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like what xiaomi has originaly
[2023-01-11T23:52:10] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is the deck cool?
[2023-01-11T23:56:23] Rogerio Figueiredo: I have a t10 here
[2023-01-11T23:56:40] Rogerio Figueiredo: Laotie es10p what do you think I I put vesc on it?
[2023-01-12T00:04:37] Rogerio Figueiredo: Bi have one
[2023-01-12T00:04:40] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is cool
[2023-01-12T00:04:52] Rogerio Figueiredo: It reach like 60 in flat
[2023-01-12T00:05:02] Rogerio Figueiredo: With vesc maybe could do mole speed
[2023-01-12T00:10:11] Rogerio Figueiredo: Not more speed why?
[2023-01-12T00:10:17] Rogerio Figueiredo: Vesc has field weakening
[2023-01-12T00:10:36] Gordan Gizdic: A lot pf power for small gains
[2023-01-12T00:10:49] Gordan Gizdic: Lile double the power for 7-8kmh
[2023-01-12T00:13:21] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, but you will need a lot of amps after kv limit cause of magnetic field is weakening but you need torque. So you are actually losing torque in real time and speed is increasing, airdrag too, so you need more and more power (amps) to get higher and higher or for even maintain speed
[2023-01-12T00:13:46] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Just go more voltage then. It will not lose torque here
[2023-01-12T00:19:54] Rogerio Figueiredo: Probably 60 os fine for that frame
[2023-01-12T00:20:42] Rogerio Figueiredo: <photos/photo_7424@12-01-2023_00-20-42.jpg>
[2023-01-12T00:29:35] Rogerio Figueiredo: Not realy
[2023-01-12T00:32:41] Gordan Gizdic: I tested and logged over 20 runs.
[2023-01-12T00:32:51] Gordan Gizdic: 8kmh with 30A of FW per motor.
[2023-01-12T00:32:59] Gordan Gizdic: That does not sound good.
[2023-01-12T00:33:15] Gordan Gizdic: No FW power was 4k and 69kmh.
[2023-01-12T00:33:36] Gordan Gizdic: 30A of FW per motor was 76kmh and 7k
[2023-01-12T00:33:49] Rogerio Figueiredo: In this scooter
[2023-01-12T00:33:50] Gordan Gizdic: So yeah, 3k more to get 8kmh is not worth it.
[2023-01-12T00:33:56] Gordan Gizdic: No, Vsett 10
[2023-01-12T00:34:43] Gordan Gizdic: I guess with 20s and high KV motors you can get more. But on 16s and low kv motors, gains are too small.
[2023-01-12T00:37:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Doesnt Really matter what scooter,the way you get more speed is inefficient and in hill climbing situation unsure how happy is contoller
[2023-01-12T00:38:29] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: The highest voltage, good amps and standard or low kv motors will bring you very close to their air rpms but on road
[2023-01-12T00:38:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: True
[2023-01-12T00:39:15] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: So ye, James, lets do 30s
[2023-01-12T00:39:17] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Hah
[2023-01-12T00:40:11] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ye, i dont forget that xD
[2023-01-12T00:40:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Why?
[2023-01-12T00:40:37] Gordan Gizdic: Its not nice when DC clamps.
[2023-01-12T00:40:40] Gordan Gizdic: Trust me.
[2023-01-12T00:40:49] Gordan Gizdic: I tried it when i was younger.
[2023-01-12T00:40:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And?
[2023-01-12T00:41:12] Gordan Gizdic: Colleague saved me by literally knocking me out with a fist.
[2023-01-12T00:41:20] Gordan Gizdic: So yeah, id be careful
[2023-01-12T00:41:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like if you make such stupid thing what the hell you are near evenüòÖ
[2023-01-12T00:41:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Reallly kills me in brain
[2023-01-12T00:42:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like i am use to life danger work, I am use to that my collegues too ,so we have trust and non dies
[2023-01-12T00:43:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Unsure how worried you need to be near so much V
[2023-01-12T00:44:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Lucky you here with us now, sry but does freaks me a bit
[2023-01-12T00:46:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well what did you dream as phase amp on what esc ?

[2023-01-12T00:57:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: But even correct way should be using probe
[2023-01-12T00:59:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: TRONIC normal blew fet due to high current , not due to temp sensor
[2023-01-12T01:00:20] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Thats why it need to be 12+ fets per side
[2023-01-12T01:00:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: They declare max current same as fet datasheet, when you have to stay at least 20% less than it.

[2023-01-12T02:14:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Basic fail cant be solved like that ,just helps
[2023-01-12T02:14:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: Its more unstable with the acceleration
[2023-01-12T02:14:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: Without this strong acceleration it don‚Äôt wobble much
[2023-01-12T02:15:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: All C like that
[2023-01-12T02:17:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: C Always be shit
[2023-01-12T02:17:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Problems not Always happen when you accelerate
[2023-01-12T02:18:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like even a janobike is stabile till you push throttle,force pulls and holds ,soon as you let go Super wobble ü§£
[2023-01-12T02:19:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: All scooter suspension is a joke to be honest
[2023-01-12T02:19:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yeah they say part
[2023-01-12T02:20:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Is not you say
[2023-01-12T02:20:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like if any of us would have one could say more
[2023-01-12T02:21:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also did you ever saw a speed fuel bike steering dumpener?
[2023-01-12T02:21:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Till its not like that ,its also a joke
[2023-01-12T02:21:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Two sided auto hardening
[2023-01-12T02:22:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Holds strait if you push,need force to turn, soon as you slow easier to turn
[2023-01-12T02:24:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Sure
[2023-01-12T02:26:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: More easy if you as like them on the video crew race random road but saved still ,also imagine this starts wobble at 40 ,he had this 280
[2023-01-12T02:27:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: At that speed all is different even wind could start it
[2023-01-12T02:28:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yeah coz normaly you dont do daily 280 in the city
[2023-01-12T02:29:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But c wobble at 40 common thing this all i mean
[2023-01-12T02:29:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: These bikes can fail too
[2023-01-12T02:29:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Speeding up compared to car and 280 is different
[2023-01-12T02:30:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well we can ask up what mods he did on frame or such
[2023-01-12T02:31:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also seeing few videos is few videos
[2023-01-12T02:31:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: He tells for sure ,maybe he did more ,maybe its good
[2023-01-12T02:32:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But i not a dualtron fan ü§î
[2023-01-12T02:32:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: ü§î basically i dont like any brand i think,but that's my bad
[2023-01-12T02:34:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also for me as metal head , strange that they want high power Scooters easy foldable, while by the look ,but maybe more look Than feature,weped builds in direction
[2023-01-12T02:35:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What i mean is
[2023-01-12T02:36:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If you go into cars ,you have cabriolets also And you would think thats weak in a way coz it doesnt have hars top
[2023-01-12T02:37:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And in a way this is true
[2023-01-12T02:37:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But if you compare weight same car hard top and cabriolet Cabrio is much more weight, coz all frame more sturdy
[2023-01-12T02:38:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Everything thicker to help that you cutted other half out
[2023-01-12T02:38:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Than we rely on tiny bolts and pins to not fail at 100üòÖ

[2023-01-12T15:20:42] Luis Magalhaes: and i already was using 16s battery in parallel
[2023-01-12T15:24:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: With same quantity of cells , but lower series and more parallels you‚Äôve more range. Due to conversion efficiency
[2023-01-12T15:25:58] Mirono escooters: That's very little difference we are talking
[2023-01-12T15:26:03] Mirono escooters: Wind resistance more important
[2023-01-12T15:26:06] Mirono escooters: Speed
[2023-01-12T15:26:27] Mirono escooters: Let's make 1s20p :)

[2023-01-12T15:30:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: And we are talking about 20% extra range, and it isn‚Äôt little difference
[2023-01-12T15:30:48] Mirono escooters: No one rides 10p at 25kmj tho ;)
[2023-01-12T15:30:56] Mirono escooters: 20%? Source?
[2023-01-12T15:32:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: Search on Google mosfet voltage regulation efficiency

[2023-01-12T15:34:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: More torque
[2023-01-12T15:34:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: They use low Kv motor or geared motor
[2023-01-12T15:35:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: In this case it‚Äôs more efficient , high voltage + geared motor
[2023-01-12T15:39:41] Mirono escooters: Nop. Gen1 ninebot
[2023-01-12T15:44:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: With g30 frame?

[2023-01-14T02:45:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: What MOSFETs are they using? More than 100v?
[2023-01-14T02:45:18] rosheee: he didn't send me 250R because i denied ^^'
[2023-01-14T02:45:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: Phase continuos = battery current

[2023-01-14T05:05:06] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: The real will be 30kg+
[2023-01-14T05:05:11] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: with batteries etc
[2023-01-14T05:05:21] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: i have same motors

[2023-01-14T05:12:51] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: LY says 25-26 is low kv on 80mm
[2023-01-14T05:13:01] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: but this is 70mm, so maybe thats low too
[2023-01-14T05:13:13] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: btw Paolo said its low kvüòÅ
[2023-01-14T05:13:18] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: i trust him

[2023-01-14T05:13:53] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: too low
[2023-01-14T05:15:24] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 19kv and such wide and 10mmq phases will be astonishing at torque
[2023-01-14T05:16:02] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: as we talking about to go mad, so 30s and 19kv motors
[2023-01-14T05:16:06] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: perfect balance
[2023-01-14T05:16:09] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: lol

[2023-01-14T05:18:40] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: actually inmotion v13 euc goes like this. big low kv motor and high voltage
[2023-01-14T05:18:54] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: so you will get speed and torque at every moment
[2023-01-14T05:20:54] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Sorry, I'm not answering because I haven't taken any such measurements yet
[2023-01-14T05:20:54] rosheee: Hmm
[2023-01-14T05:21:08] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: but it looks like 140mm
[2023-01-14T05:21:12] rosheee: But i asked u so many times
[2023-01-14T05:21:13] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: or close

[2023-01-14T05:23:40] rosheee: But then brakes
[2023-01-14T05:23:41] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I actually planned to buy 80mm later and push the levers apart and weld them up again
[2023-01-14T05:23:48] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: front is easier
[2023-01-14T05:23:51] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: need new axles
[2023-01-14T05:23:52] rosheee: Damn..
[2023-01-14T05:23:59] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: rear is welded together arms

[2023-01-14T05:24:27] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 140
[2023-01-14T05:24:35] rosheee: Hmm
[2023-01-14T05:24:36] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: like stock one
[2023-01-14T05:25:03] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: but i can redo measure a little bit later
[2023-01-14T05:25:11] rosheee: <3
[2023-01-14T05:26:19] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: also this distance from both sides
[2023-01-14T05:26:55] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: and the axle of stator core is larger than usual ly or other 11" motors
[2023-01-14T05:27:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: tricky scooter..
[2023-01-14T05:27:14] rosheee: Omg
[2023-01-14T05:27:30] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: no, its m12, but cutted less
[2023-01-14T05:27:32] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: from sides
[2023-01-14T05:27:45] rosheee: I rly wait until u changed motors xD @KenLawrence
[2023-01-14T05:27:55] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: mooore later

[2023-01-14T05:28:16] rosheee: Add temp sensor?
[2023-01-14T05:28:28] rosheee: U need? I add to ferrofluid
[2023-01-14T05:28:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: very hard. Like dont do anything to it ahah
[2023-01-14T05:28:43] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: what sensor?
[2023-01-14T05:28:51] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: already in stock

[2023-01-14T05:31:55] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: ye, magura works but not enough for such big weights and speeds
[2023-01-14T05:33:03] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: The boiling point is higher than that of any mineral liquid. Especially on sport/racing tasks
[2023-01-14T05:35:51] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: yep
[2023-01-14T05:36:09] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: also dot is working instantly
[2023-01-14T05:36:13] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: and perfect for me
[2023-01-14T05:40:21] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: also its too rare
[2023-01-14T05:40:35] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: and only from trickstuff as i see

[2023-01-14T05:42:22] rosheee: i can send u xD
[2023-01-14T05:43:10] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: it can't be used with hope or any dot system

[2023-01-14T05:44:51] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: i always loved dot and will use it with all my vehicles, moto or scooters. Just easier and better perfomance already
[2023-01-14T05:45:18] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: no need such radicals searchings items from worldwide :)
[2023-01-14T05:46:46] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: nope

[2023-01-14T05:49:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: hope will fit even 3.6mm i guess
[2023-01-14T05:49:22] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: There is still a gap
[2023-01-14T05:49:54] rosheee: but can fit 160mm?
[2023-01-14T05:49:58] rosheee: and custom caliper xD?

[2023-01-14T05:57:12] rosheee: very nice
[2023-01-14T05:58:36] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Must modify rotors otherwise they wont sit on the motors
[2023-01-14T05:58:48] rosheee: but with different motors
[2023-01-14T05:58:54] rosheee: i just don't wanna modify frame
[2023-01-14T05:58:55] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: No
[2023-01-14T05:59:02] rosheee: if modify frame then project RIP
[2023-01-14T06:00:10] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: motorcycle rotors dont have bicycle center circle. They are bigger. GT2 also has bigger landing, no bicycle standard
[2023-01-14T06:01:03] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: other motors like LY or other is just simple bicycle standards
[2023-01-14T06:01:10] rosheee: ah lol
[2023-01-14T06:01:26] rosheee: so maybe can evolve to bigass motorcycle calipers?
[2023-01-14T06:01:42] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: no, you dont have so much space
[2023-01-14T06:01:49] rosheee: ok

[2023-01-14T06:02:10] rosheee: i don't think it is crap
[2023-01-14T06:02:26] rosheee: but if not much customize room then ...
[2023-01-14T06:03:12] rosheee: without frame welding
[2023-01-14T06:04:25] rosheee: but 22S8P
[2023-01-14T06:04:25] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Even if I want to put a suspension from FOX, for example, then no one with an external oil tank will come in here. Only straight good pneumatics or spring oil without a tank
[2023-01-14T06:04:38] rosheee: perfect
[2023-01-14T06:04:43] rosheee: no need if suc√©
[2023-01-14T06:05:04] rosheee: all the expensive fox and rockshox shit isn't that good on g30
[2023-01-14T06:05:19] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Pneumatics here will die much earlier, because the load is much greater than in bicycles
[2023-01-14T06:05:21] rosheee: @AJAJ1992 cheap aliexpress damper feels better than 400-600euro fox
[2023-01-14T06:05:43] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: g30 is closer to bicycle lol
[2023-01-14T06:05:56] rosheee: ^^

[2023-01-14T06:07:21] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: very stable, lower at low speed, it feels like a cruiser motorcycle
[2023-01-14T06:07:23] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: not a scooter
[2023-01-14T06:07:23] rosheee: stability is EL1337

[2023-01-15T14:30:02] Peter Pan: Why they always solder to the skinny part of the mosfet leg? Imho TO6 is rated for 50A on the thin part and 75A on the thick part. Using the thick part would prevent some heat.
[2023-01-15T14:34:02] Mirono escooters: Tru weird it gets smoller
[2023-01-15T14:34:08] Mirono escooters: But the small part shouldn't matter much it's short
[2023-01-15T14:36:22] Peter Pan: May be, but it is the weakest part of the circuit and will eventualy act as a fuse.
[2023-01-15T14:37:55] Mirono escooters: If u push it over specs
[2023-01-15T14:38:13] Mirono escooters: I'm sure datasheet engineers are smort
[2023-01-15T14:38:57] Peter Pan: I am only asking...
[2023-01-15T14:39:47] Peter Pan: may be this is the reason for the burned esc
[2023-01-15T14:40:10] Mirono escooters: I bet more on tronic quality issues
[2023-01-15T14:40:41] Peter Pan: hope you are right.
[2023-01-15T15:13:09] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Because mosfets need to be in a specific place as planned by electrical engineers. If you remove the thin part and solder the mosfets with thick legs, then they will be in a standing position and will cause problems with esc dimensions and custom heatsinks
[2023-01-15T15:13:24] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Nucular do this hundreds of years i.e
[2023-01-15T15:13:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: <photos/photo_7482@15-01-2023_15-13-28.jpg>
[2023-01-15T15:13:40] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: No thin legs at all. Cutted
[2023-01-15T15:14:10] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But they are standing only. And ofc you are limited by the mosfets crystal, not legs
[2023-01-15T15:43:02] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: They have a lot of electrical protections
[2023-01-15T15:43:11] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: some vesc's dont
[2023-01-15T15:59:23] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Protection against short-circuit phases. Protection of halls with phases and polarities from shorty. It is hard to short circuit nucular esc in practical. Also there's a lot more added in the new revisions. Me need to find time, follow and read about it
[2023-01-15T16:02:00] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: ubox doesnt have
[2023-01-15T16:02:24] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: tronic/focers/3shul dont know
[2023-01-15T16:02:52] Mirono escooters: I've once shorted phases flipsky, it survived xD
[2023-01-15T16:02:55] Mirono escooters: And mp2 too
[2023-01-15T16:03:26] Mirono escooters: Problably
[2023-01-15T16:03:28] Mirono escooters: For the price
[2023-01-15T16:05:34] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: nah, its software protection to avoid high current ripples
[2023-01-15T16:07:24] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 1 year waiting for order
[2023-01-15T16:07:33] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: ye, a little bit hah
[2023-01-15T16:08:25] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Vostok scooter with all custom things and custom water cooling 200mm magnet motor riding with 24f
[2023-01-15T16:08:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: only rear
[2023-01-15T16:08:30] Mirono escooters: :/ they should ramp production. I'd defenitely buy
[2023-01-15T16:08:55] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: its faster than any scooter out there with only one motor
[2023-01-15T16:09:15] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Need to try it too sometime
[2023-01-15T16:09:22] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I really like vesc software
[2023-01-15T16:09:34] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: i mean acceleration
[2023-01-15T16:09:41] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: the speed not so fast
[2023-01-15T16:09:43] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: around 120
[2023-01-15T16:10:12] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But look. He sending same power only to one motor hah
[2023-01-15T16:10:29] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 25-30kw to 1 rear motor
[2023-01-15T16:11:27] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: No
[2023-01-15T16:11:32] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Its custom very wide
[2023-01-15T16:12:01] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Around 500A
[2023-01-15T16:12:21] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Grip
[2023-01-15T16:12:23] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: No
[2023-01-15T16:12:25] Peter Pan: Somewhere has to be a weak spot. If the fet dies, there will be a short. The whole stuff is beefed up and the bms will deliver more than the skinny leg could take. If the crystal vaporates, it might be ok.
[2023-01-15T16:12:51] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: We have here some scooters with 600-700A summed both with votol escs
[2023-01-15T16:12:57] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: and they are slower than him
[2023-01-15T16:13:06] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: because of grip
[2023-01-15T16:13:29] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Will try to search, wait
[2023-01-15T16:15:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, but front wheel will not have enough grip, so you are practically using rear as more as possible for the grip
[2023-01-15T16:23:38] Konstantin: Few days ago on table, I'm to, shorted phase flypsky, all work ok...
[2023-01-15T16:28:57] Konstantin: Just switching sensor less mode, and continue driving...

[2023-01-15T17:22:36] Mirono escooters: Something in it attracts me
[2023-01-15T17:22:44] Konstantin: But rear suspension now return to stock... 1 spring broken

[2023-01-15T17:30:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: 60kmh is suicide
[2023-01-15T17:31:01] Konstantin: And no mechanical brake... Only rear swing;)) + recuperation
[2023-01-15T17:45:08] Martin Kaktits: not fast enough to guarantee death
[2023-01-15T17:49:02] Jan: So you let your children ride 60kph with no mechanical brakes? #responsibleparents üëå
[2023-01-15T17:49:49] Jan: I would at least write one off, that it will not turn 18
[2023-01-15T18:04:09] rosheee: Lol 1 year xD
[2023-01-15T18:20:24] Gordan Gizdic: Insulation foam?
[2023-01-15T18:20:33] Gordan Gizdic: Idk, hardware store?
[2023-01-15T18:21:53] Mirono escooters: Any hardware store
[2023-01-15T18:25:30] Mirono escooters: We have alot
[2023-01-15T18:48:50] Mirono escooters: UwU
[2023-01-15T18:52:07] Gordan Gizdic: I dont think this is burned. Just stupid discoloration. But maybe im wrong.
[2023-01-15T18:53:05] Mirono escooters: It is
[2023-01-15T18:53:09] Mirono escooters: It should be soldered dbetter
[2023-01-15T18:53:10] Mirono escooters: Big heat
[2023-01-15T18:56:07] Gordan Gizdic: Yeah, soldering should have been done much much better.
[2023-01-15T18:56:11] Gordan Gizdic: I agree with that.
[2023-01-15T18:56:24] Gordan Gizdic: If my motor looks like that, ill demand new ones.
[2023-01-15T18:56:27] Gordan Gizdic: Fuck that.
[2023-01-15T18:58:10] Konstantin: It's vesc, just load profile 25kmh and reduce power to 500w ;)
[2023-01-15T18:59:21] Gordan Gizdic: I load 300w and 10kmh. üòÅ
[2023-01-15T18:59:29] Gordan Gizdic: I call it turtle mode.
[2023-01-15T18:59:30] Gordan Gizdic: üòÇ
[2023-01-15T19:00:08] Konstantin: ;)))
[2023-01-15T19:02:48] Gordan Gizdic: Sneez the fluid over motors. Should be good. üòÅ
[2023-01-15T19:02:54] Gordan Gizdic: Sneeze*
[2023-01-15T19:03:48] Unknown: Do you have craft stores? Hobby store?
[2023-01-15T19:04:04] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 5ml is enough. Take out the stator and just pour a small amount between each magnet, at the junction. It's enough.
[2023-01-15T19:04:38] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But, for 10 inch its ok
[2023-01-15T19:04:44] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 3-5
[2023-01-15T19:04:52] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ofc it touches)
[2023-01-15T19:05:14] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Check youtube how ferrofluid works when magnet field intensifies
[2023-01-15T19:06:03] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: when a field arises, it rises with stakes
[2023-01-15T19:07:00] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: this is why it almost does not interfere with rotation, it is just too little ml
[2023-01-15T19:07:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: And its already enough
[2023-01-15T19:08:02] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: just a little bit to fill the air space between the stator and the rotor
[2023-01-15T19:10:10] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes!
[2023-01-15T19:10:14] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Its ok
[2023-01-15T19:10:35] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: so 2.5ml then
[2023-01-15T19:10:36] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: my bad
[2023-01-15T19:10:45] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 11 inch maybe need 3-4ml
[2023-01-15T19:12:03] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Very interesting to monitor with temp sensor this while riding
[2023-01-15T19:12:06] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: before and after
[2023-01-15T19:13:21] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: lool
[2023-01-15T21:56:18] S1m 0n: Should I also put n drop of ferrorfluid in a drone üòÑ
[2023-01-15T21:56:18] S1m 0n: <video_file>
[2023-01-15T21:59:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: Font need, ferrofluid only for closed motor where is no air flow. But a 7 inch fan cool much than enough.
[2023-01-15T22:02:39] Unknown: Apparently ferrofluid is Grapeseed oil. I would not use because dust would get stuck and make mud.
[2023-01-15T22:03:06] Mirono escooters: Dafak?
[2023-01-15T22:03:27] S1m 0n: Right I had not even thought of ü§ó

[2023-01-15T23:37:32] rosheee: 1 motor not suc√©
[2023-01-15T23:37:38] rosheee: more resistance when spinning
[2023-01-15T23:38:05] Mirono escooters: Oh no
[2023-01-15T23:38:15] Mirono escooters: I'd defenitely resolder after seeing these pics

[2023-01-16T01:23:10] rosheee: what resistance u have now?
[2023-01-16T01:55:12] rosheee: 3. What's the difference between J version and standard version: * J version optimized and strengthen circuit protection: Add Hall circuit protection clamp Diode Add TVS(5V) to surpress spike on 5V circuit Add TVS(78V) to surpress bus input spike * Used different MOSFET. J version used 100V mosfet Standard version used 80V mosfet Below is their test data difference.

[2023-01-17T00:17:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Maybe rs gives it to you üòÅ i mean the case
[2023-01-17T00:18:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Send wrong one
[2023-01-17T00:18:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Tells gal they burned, send other ü§£üòÅ
[2023-01-17T00:20:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Tell one tronic burns. Gal sends another 3 pcs, you take one, profit
[2023-01-17T00:21:25] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Or. Burn 2pcs of 250s and gal send one 750
[2023-01-17T00:21:56] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But, they must burn in action

[2023-01-17T01:14:51] Konstantin: And few day ago 2*75200 receive, paste too, to much paste :)
[2023-01-17T01:15:30] Konstantin: Like this
[2023-01-17T01:17:43] Konstantin: Remove extra, use blue thread lock for 4 small screw
[2023-01-17T01:20:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: Mine is glued lol
[2023-01-17T01:29:07] rosheee: btw @SibClimb brake-stuff can also do the disc in 3mm ^^
[2023-01-17T01:32:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: Then do it
[2023-01-17T01:32:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: 300‚Ç¨ now
[2023-01-17T07:17:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: Oh woaw, this interests me
[2023-01-17T07:18:26] rosheee: he can do whatever disc u want

[2023-01-17T16:56:01] Mirono escooters: How, wich esc
[2023-01-17T17:07:17] Luis Magalhaes: compact ?
[2023-01-17T17:12:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: 55Ah for 8km? I think is wrong shunt setup, or is very inefficient motor .
[2023-01-17T17:15:38] Face de Pin Suc√©: You don't look at good values x)
[2023-01-17T17:16:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: 19Ah for 8Km
[2023-01-17T17:20:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: Which is a lot, but if I remember, this was few days ago, and I was almost full throttle and full brakes for all time
[2023-01-17T17:20:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: X)
[2023-01-17T17:20:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: You can see a 125Kmh happened in city, like, middle of the city, I had no time üòÇ
[2023-01-17T17:28:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: Lol right
[2023-01-17T17:28:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: But is escooter?
[2023-01-17T17:29:04] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes
[2023-01-17T17:36:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: Rosche still beat you on wattsüòÅüòÇ
[2023-01-17T17:37:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: Of course, I wasn't full speed üòÇüòÇ
[2023-01-17T17:37:20] Face de Pin Suc√©: I currently get some troubles
[2023-01-17T17:37:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: BMS hit short circuit for no reasons
[2023-01-17T17:37:41] Face de Pin Suc√©: And since it rains almost everyday
[2023-01-17T17:37:45] Face de Pin Suc√©: I can't run my tests
[2023-01-17T17:38:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: But I think because too much current or too much current quickly then it triggers short circuit protection
[2023-01-17T17:38:24] Face de Pin Suc√©: But I already had 3 cuts at more than 130Kmh üòÇüò≠
[2023-01-17T17:41:18] Face de Pin Suc√©: ANT 300A 20S, never had this issue before, but also never drawn so much current phase, I think it does a huge current peak
[2023-01-17T17:42:09] Luis Magalhaes: More time for the short-circuit cut maybe?
[2023-01-17T17:42:23] Face de Pin Suc√©: That's what I want to try yes
[2023-01-17T17:42:30] Luis Magalhaes: üëåüòÅ
[2023-01-17T17:42:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes this is phase current
[2023-01-17T17:43:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: Currently, settings are 350A phase per controller and 160A battery per esc
[2023-01-17T17:43:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes üòÇ
[2023-01-17T17:43:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: No field weakening because not needed at all x)
[2023-01-17T17:44:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: This battery current
[2023-01-17T17:44:41] Face de Pin Suc√©: This phase current

[2023-01-17T17:45:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: Damn, did a 20KW on air
[2023-01-17T17:45:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: More than on ground üò≠üòÇ
[2023-01-17T17:47:10] Jan: 700A
[2023-01-17T17:47:17] Jan: üò±
[2023-01-17T17:48:18] Face de Pin Suc√©: I should take the Dragy also when possible
[2023-01-17T17:53:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: Field Weakening only adds phase amps
[2023-01-17T17:54:04] Face de Pin Suc√©: but it can pull more battery current if you're not maxxed for the settings
[2023-01-17T17:54:49] Face de Pin Suc√©: If you put 300A battery and you pull only 150A, pushing field weakening will pull more battery amps, but never more than the 300A
[2023-01-17T17:55:02] Face de Pin Suc√©: but sometimes you have small spikes
[2023-01-17T17:55:20] Face de Pin Suc√©: it shouldn't exceed a lot the battery current setted and be very very very short
[2023-01-17T17:56:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: not if everything is well setted
[2023-01-17T17:56:40] Face de Pin Suc√©: it's not normal
[2023-01-17T17:56:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: send log
[2023-01-17T17:57:06] rosheee: <sticker>
[2023-01-17T17:57:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: oh you speak about roschee
[2023-01-17T17:57:26] rosheee: But FDP more booT idk
[2023-01-17T17:57:29] Face de Pin Suc√©: tronic/focer have some troubles I think with current x)
[2023-01-17T17:58:07] rosheee: <voice_message>
[2023-01-17T17:59:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: Don't know x)
[2023-01-17T18:00:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: I use field on my speedway leger everyday and it doesn't exceed the battery current setted
[2023-01-17T18:00:08] rosheee: Why 17kw at 690a xD?
[2023-01-17T18:00:21] Face de Pin Suc√©: I setted 75A and sometimes I get 78A from battery
[2023-01-17T18:00:25] rosheee: 200A battery on motor
[2023-01-17T18:00:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: but full speed I pull 1400W while before I pulled 900W (less speed)
[2023-01-17T18:01:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: Because only 125Kmh, not full speed, 20+KW happens at higher acceleration
[2023-01-17T18:05:02] rosheee: <sticker>
[2023-01-17T18:05:16] rosheee: I lose kw at high b00st
[2023-01-17T18:05:23] rosheee: <sticker>
[2023-01-17T18:05:38] rosheee: Maybe 250R fix
[2023-01-17T18:06:07] Face de Pin Suc√©: 250R will be worst x)
[2023-01-17T18:06:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: still 6 fets
[2023-01-17T18:06:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: higher voltage
[2023-01-17T18:06:21] Face de Pin Suc√©: less amps
[2023-01-17T18:06:39] Face de Pin Suc√©: then using 250R at 20S, no sense x)
[2023-01-17T18:06:39] Jan: Im still waiting for the spintend 12fet alu vesc
[2023-01-17T18:06:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: holidays for now x)
[2023-01-17T18:07:04] Jan: Ah chinese new year
[2023-01-17T18:07:07] Gordan Gizdic: So ubox batt amps is always constant to how much you limit it no matter how much FW current you push?
[2023-01-17T18:07:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: yes üòÜ
[2023-01-17T18:08:03] Face de Pin Suc√©: I remember being the first to burn the focer/tronic x)
[2023-01-17T18:08:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: then I tried another, burnt it too
[2023-01-17T18:08:16] Face de Pin Suc√©: then, ....
[2023-01-17T18:08:18] Face de Pin Suc√©: xD
[2023-01-17T18:08:31] Gordan Gizdic: @jamessoderstrom This changes everything. I need to repeat all tests now.
[2023-01-17T18:08:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: first burnt at full throttle (265A phase per vesc)
[2023-01-17T18:08:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: second one at 15kmh
[2023-01-17T18:08:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: third one at 25kmh
[2023-01-17T18:09:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: then fuck I sold the last 2 I had
[2023-01-17T18:09:16] Face de Pin Suc√©: and I forgot I had one in a box x)
[2023-01-17T18:10:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: Try to explain to @roscheeee ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2023-01-17T18:10:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: yes true
[2023-01-17T18:11:03] Face de Pin Suc√©: but if he continues to push those amps
[2023-01-17T18:11:18] Face de Pin Suc√©: I hope he creates a airplane bridge between him and gal
[2023-01-17T18:11:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: to have a good supply of tronics hahaha
[2023-01-17T18:11:48] Konstantin: Try man's build it's by own ;))
[2023-01-17T18:12:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: I don't understand
[2023-01-17T18:13:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: hahaha

[2023-01-17T18:14:40] Konstantin: Hand made ;)
[2023-01-17T18:15:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: well, I prefer dragy
[2023-01-17T18:15:16] Face de Pin Suc√©: because it's "official"
[2023-01-17T18:15:19] Mirono escooters: Dragy is a hardware or software thing?
[2023-01-17T18:15:23] Konstantin: It's dragy...
[2023-01-17T18:15:26] Mirono escooters: I like his one
[2023-01-17T18:15:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: nobody will say "you cheated"
[2023-01-17T18:15:30] Konstantin: Both
[2023-01-17T18:15:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: both
[2023-01-17T18:15:41] Face de Pin Suc√©: what is it 0-100 9s ?
[2023-01-17T18:16:11] Konstantin: All data don't remember
[2023-01-17T18:43:03] Konstantin: 2*12 nuclar, mb 20-21s..
[2023-01-17T18:44:24] Mirono escooters: 170‚Ç¨ for gps box? ü•≤
[2023-01-17T23:25:47] Thierry: I confirm that Flipsky exceed battery amps, I wonder since a while how does it work. Could be that fw is added to phase amps but will not exceed maximum phase current. So if battery is 50A, phase 70A and fw 30A then battery amps will be: required amps to sustain speed + fw but never higher than 70A. It is only an assumption. If I have time and snow melt I will perform some tests
[2023-01-17T23:34:13] Thierry: I got crazy battery amps with a lot of fw so when I set more fw, I keep an eye on bms app. Then enjoy full throttle
[2023-01-18T00:10:49] rosheee: But
[2023-01-18T00:10:54] rosheee: Guys
[2023-01-18T00:10:59] rosheee: XD it works
[2023-01-18T00:11:03] rosheee: Focer also
[2023-01-18T00:11:16] rosheee: Last time was front one
[2023-01-18T00:11:30] rosheee: Front one was the one of...wait i go to laptop xD
[2023-01-18T00:23:58] rosheee: wtf xD
[2023-01-18T01:01:44] rosheee: but how the fuck u get more watts when more speed xD?!
[2023-01-18T01:02:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because TRONIC is special
[2023-01-18T01:02:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: Maybe they use special silicon
[2023-01-18T01:02:52] rosheee: wtf 700A air xD?!
[2023-01-18T01:03:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: I would try this current with 22x3 ü§£
[2023-01-18T01:04:24] rosheee: but why he get more amps when faster?
[2023-01-18T01:04:30] rosheee: <sticker>
[2023-01-18T01:05:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs just normally
[2023-01-18T01:06:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: More speed more watts , because output voltage is higher
[2023-01-18T01:07:44] rosheee: lol
[2023-01-18T01:07:52] rosheee: at high speed i get like no watts
[2023-01-18T01:08:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: Your TRONIC failed
[2023-01-18T01:08:12] rosheee: noi
[2023-01-18T01:08:14] rosheee: also spintend
[2023-01-18T01:08:15] rosheee: all failed
[2023-01-18T01:08:21] rosheee: something strange
[2023-01-18T01:08:26] rosheee: sometimes it goes fuckeria
[2023-01-18T01:08:28] rosheee: sometimes not
[2023-01-18T01:08:35] rosheee: sometimes max 117
[2023-01-18T01:08:37] rosheee: then 130
[2023-01-18T01:08:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yah
[2023-01-18T01:09:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Kelly 7212 best
[2023-01-18T01:09:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Small, cheap , shit, but so good
[2023-01-18T01:13:35] rosheee: <sticker>
[2023-01-18T01:24:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Now all we have to do is to write that to Spintend!
[2023-01-18T01:24:47] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Cmon, they are going to create small thing that output more than 7230s
[2023-01-18T01:24:57] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Isnt that pretty guys
[2023-01-18T01:25:37] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Rodger, you are trollingüòÖ
[2023-01-18T01:25:57] rosheee: why
[2023-01-18T01:26:03] rosheee: i want also more watts when faster
[2023-01-18T01:26:09] rosheee: the faster the less watts
[2023-01-18T01:26:16] rosheee: <sticker>
[2023-01-18T01:29:22] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ofc you need more continious watts when you are going faster
[2023-01-18T01:32:12] rosheee: yes
[2023-01-18T01:33:18] rosheee: nah i thought he gets more watts when going highspeed
[2023-01-18T01:34:09] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Cubed power versus speed. If you know, for example, how much constant power you need to drive 60 (let's say 1500 watts). Then you divide the desired high speed by 60, you get a ratio. You raise it to a cube and multiply 1500 watts by this number. You get how much power you need to move at a new high speed
[2023-01-18T01:34:32] rosheee: yah but ^^' omg
[2023-01-18T01:34:34] rosheee: me maybe to tired
[2023-01-18T01:35:01] rosheee: we get 23kw at like 117 130kmh like 15kw
[2023-01-18T01:36:02] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: This is peak power. When accelerating you can easily get much higher than you need continious to maintain certain speed
[2023-01-18T01:36:15] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: For 100 kmh i need 8000w, i.e
[2023-01-18T01:36:45] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But before 100 kmh, while accelerating, i can have every watts, like 50kw
[2023-01-18T01:37:06] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Depends on peak currents, hardware and my desires
[2023-01-18T01:38:01] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But for maintain 100 kmh without any acceleration i need 8kw constant
[2023-01-18T01:38:52] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I calculate by myself, i will need around 26-27kw to maintain 150 kmh
[2023-01-18T01:38:59] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Not accelerate, but maintain!
[2023-01-18T01:42:41] rosheee: ah yah lol that i know
[2023-01-18T01:42:50] rosheee: sry then i was confused
[2023-01-18T01:42:51] rosheee: ^^'
[2023-01-18T01:45:29] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 15kw and 125 kmh is pretty close to what you will get in constant discharge to maintain that speed!
[2023-01-18T01:46:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: For actual 130kmh i calculated smth around 17kw constant
[2023-01-18T01:47:36] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But ofc its only for me and my factors
[2023-01-18T01:47:50] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Different weights, wind, your outfit etc

[2023-01-18T02:09:27] rosheee: YUS
[2023-01-18T02:09:39] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: So all this need to be wires separate directly from the battery
[2023-01-18T02:09:44] rosheee: lol

[2023-01-18T02:09:53] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: Not from the controller
[2023-01-18T02:11:10] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: The controller has wires for lights, brake light etc

[2023-01-18T02:13:56] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: Never tought about this but if you want I can ask the guy that made them
[2023-01-18T02:16:21] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I would think so too, to be honestüòÖ
[2023-01-18T02:16:54] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: The most powerful controller they have is 350A continuos and 700A peak for 20 seconds
[2023-01-18T02:17:11] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: What you see on controller is not battery A, is phase A
[2023-01-18T02:17:47] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But their continious values are battery current numbers, ye?
[2023-01-18T02:18:09] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: No

[2023-01-18T02:19:02] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: For each 100A (phase) is used 50A battery
[2023-01-18T02:19:33] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: Sometimes they drain a bit more depending on the load or the motors
[2023-01-18T02:19:43] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Oh
[2023-01-18T02:19:58] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I get it

[2023-01-20T01:21:16] Jason Nelson: What is the benefit to gears?
[2023-01-20T01:23:00] Jason Nelson: That's what I just read
[2023-01-20T01:23:04] Jason Nelson: Essentially
[2023-01-20T01:23:13] Jason Nelson: Good in every way just more complicated
[2023-01-20T01:23:45] Jason Nelson: Basically it said it's smoother and easier to control
[2023-01-20T01:24:41] Jason Nelson: It also says it's more efficient
[2023-01-20T01:25:46] Jason Nelson: P100 has same stem size and display bolts as the max
[2023-01-20T01:26:06] Jason Nelson: Maybe it has a different slip fit
[2023-01-20T01:26:30] Jason Nelson: For the display, but if not you could potentially put the cockpit display on the max
[2023-01-20T01:26:53] Jason Nelson: Good and bad
[2023-01-20T01:27:03] Jason Nelson: The best part being ninebot craftsmanship
[2023-01-20T01:28:01] Jason Nelson: For a $2,000 scooter with a 650 w motor and a 23 amp hour battery you would think that you could get more than 25 miles at 30 mph
[2023-01-20T01:29:07] Jason Nelson: It is super solid though
[2023-01-20T01:29:17] Jason Nelson: Nothing looks cheap or tacky
[2023-01-20T01:29:35] Jason Nelson: Yeah
[2023-01-20T01:29:45] Jason Nelson: I think for the deal it's way better than the gt
[2023-01-20T01:29:55] Jason Nelson: But if you gotta go 37mph I guess
[2023-01-20T01:30:15] Jason Nelson: It probably gets like 10 miles in unlocked sport mode ü§£
[2023-01-20T01:30:31] Jason Nelson: I heard it has the same pack as the p100
[2023-01-20T01:47:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Quiet? Where, noisest shit i heard and its continues noise üòÖ
[2023-01-20T01:47:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Normaly you would step down and think mosfets burned or something
[2023-01-20T01:48:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Not exatly,but its a shitty loud noise
[2023-01-20T01:48:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Somewhere i might have a video ,but maybe too far to hear
[2023-01-20T01:49:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: There is a few things whats good in it ,rest is shit
[2023-01-20T01:51:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Basically this isnt real gearing
[2023-01-20T01:51:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Unsure how to explain
[2023-01-20T01:51:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If Engine goes uphill or strugle, it swiches only to gain torque
[2023-01-20T01:52:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But this works mechanical way
[2023-01-20T01:54:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Basically idea is not bad ,but it's not for all ,but alternative for ppl with bigger weight üòÖ

[2023-01-20T02:03:41] rosheee: but when no other ppl then no prob
[2023-01-20T02:03:46] Jason Nelson: Someone running a stop sign is what sent me to the hospital

[2023-01-20T02:07:33] rosheee: when crash change stem
[2023-01-20T02:07:39] rosheee: stem 60bucks
[2023-01-20T02:07:46] rosheee: sad that can't buy G30D v2 stem
[2023-01-20T02:07:55] rosheee: cuz g30d v2 stem thicker
[2023-01-20T02:07:58] rosheee: better folding
[2023-01-20T02:07:58] Jason Nelson: But.. a lot of big roots on the trail
[2023-01-20T02:08:38] Jason Nelson: I'm thinking p100 stem may be interchangeable with g30
[2023-01-20T02:08:49] rosheee: yes
[2023-01-20T02:08:56] rosheee: idk

[2023-01-20T02:10:00] Jason Nelson: <photos/photo_7552@20-01-2023_02-10-00.jpg>
[2023-01-20T02:10:01] Jason Nelson: <photos/photo_7553@20-01-2023_02-10-01.jpg>
[2023-01-20T02:10:18] Jason Nelson: My 3D prints fit around the stem, it is the exact same diameter

[2023-01-20T02:16:40] rosheee: 3 caps instead of
[2023-01-20T02:16:41] rosheee: 1
[2023-01-20T02:16:57] Jason Nelson: Even if you have it all modified
[2023-01-20T02:17:03] rosheee: ^^
[2023-01-20T02:17:12] rosheee: snsc frame more suc√©
[2023-01-20T02:17:23] Jason Nelson: SNSC frame is what I got in my accident with and it broke in half
[2023-01-20T02:17:32] rosheee: lol
[2023-01-20T02:17:33] rosheee: then not suc√©
[2023-01-20T02:17:34] rosheee: XD
[2023-01-20T02:17:40] Jason Nelson: Snapped where the controller mounts
[2023-01-20T02:18:10] Jason Nelson: Snsc 2.3 on the top of controller mount
[2023-01-20T02:18:15] Jason Nelson: I'll try to find the picture
[2023-01-20T02:18:48] Jason Nelson: The container mounts in the collar of the scooter
[2023-01-20T02:18:53] Jason Nelson: Controller*
[2023-01-20T02:18:55] rosheee: only issue ever had with g30d frame was once the stem that wobbled
[2023-01-20T02:20:19] Jason Nelson: <photos/photo_7559@20-01-2023_02-20-19.jpg>
[2023-01-20T02:20:35] Jason Nelson: You can see the broken piece inside the deck
[2023-01-20T02:20:48] Jason Nelson: Yes they did not stop at a stop sign
[2023-01-20T02:20:58] Jason Nelson: I had someone stop and say that they were going over 30 mph through the stop sign
[2023-01-20T02:22:08] Jason Nelson: I've thought about it but I can't forfeit the folding
[2023-01-20T02:22:41] Jason Nelson: But I have 15 years of skateboarding experience and I can ride with no hands so I know it's not just me putting too much stress while riding
[2023-01-20T02:22:51] rosheee: wtf
[2023-01-20T02:22:51] rosheee: XD
[2023-01-20T02:23:05] rosheee: HOLYJESUSMOFO
[2023-01-20T02:23:07] Jason Nelson: I think you could do it with the suspension no problem
[2023-01-20T02:23:19] Jason Nelson: You should see the car
[2023-01-20T02:23:30] Jason Nelson: The craziest part is I didn't bleed a drop
[2023-01-20T02:23:36] rosheee: better for u
[2023-01-20T02:23:37] rosheee: X
[2023-01-20T02:23:37] rosheee: xd
[2023-01-20T02:23:46] Jason Nelson: Only a shattered pelvis
[2023-01-20T02:24:10] Jason Nelson: A little more, but you have to cut out some rails
[2023-01-20T02:24:31] Jason Nelson: I forget, I calculated how many cells you could fit inside at one point, I think it was over 140
[2023-01-20T02:25:04] rosheee: 21700?
[2023-01-20T02:25:11] rosheee: u have pic of full frame?
[2023-01-20T02:25:12] Jason Nelson: No
[2023-01-20T02:25:16] rosheee: ah lol
[2023-01-20T02:25:17] rosheee: 18650
[2023-01-20T02:25:19] rosheee: then nah
[2023-01-20T02:25:21] Jason Nelson: Yes
[2023-01-20T02:25:35] rosheee: 120x 21700 in g30 body
[2023-01-20T02:25:45] rosheee: but steering angle omg
[2023-01-20T02:25:54] Jason Nelson: Yes
[2023-01-20T02:26:04] rosheee: look at it
[2023-01-20T02:26:05] Jason Nelson: It doesn't have the same turn radius
[2023-01-20T02:26:12] Jason Nelson: And it's shorter handles
[2023-01-20T02:26:23] rosheee: hmm
[2023-01-20T02:26:24] Jason Nelson: But the handles are wider as well
[2023-01-20T02:27:31] Jason Nelson: Well
[2023-01-20T02:27:44] Jason Nelson: I had a battery hanging from my handle bars
[2023-01-20T02:27:47] Jason Nelson: ü§£
[2023-01-20T02:27:56] rosheee: ^^^'
[2023-01-20T02:28:30] Jason Nelson: You get less radius
[2023-01-20T02:28:57] Jason Nelson: It is good
[2023-01-20T02:29:01] Jason Nelson: I think more stable
[2023-01-20T02:29:10] Jason Nelson: But
[2023-01-20T02:29:23] Jason Nelson: Part of that stability comes from the suspension which I've adapter
[2023-01-20T02:29:29] Jason Nelson: Adapted*
[2023-01-20T02:30:14] rosheee: Sh0w
[2023-01-20T02:30:21] Jason Nelson: I'm waiting on a solid 2.5 for it
[2023-01-20T02:30:28] Jason Nelson: I don't have a picture of it apart
[2023-01-20T02:31:02] Jason Nelson: Snsc is only solid
[2023-01-20T02:35:22] rosheee: Ok
[2023-01-20T02:37:23] Jason Nelson: You have to cut the stem just below the taper for the bearing and do the same with the stock fork and then you have to square it up perfectly center and weeks them back together
[2023-01-20T02:37:38] rosheee: XD cut aiaiaiia
[2023-01-20T02:37:39] Jason Nelson: Weld*
[2023-01-20T02:37:58] Jason Nelson: You were from the inside and the outside
[2023-01-20T02:38:04] Jason Nelson: Weld
[2023-01-20T02:38:24] Jason Nelson: If you remove the tire you can see the tube on the inside
[2023-01-20T02:38:37] rosheee: Iaaiaiia
[2023-01-20T02:39:27] rosheee: <photos/photo_7560@20-01-2023_02-39-27.jpg>
