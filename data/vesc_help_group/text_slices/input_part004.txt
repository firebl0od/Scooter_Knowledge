[2023-01-20T18:43:06] Mauro Christian: ok

[2023-01-20T18:45:02] Mauro Christian: ok
[2023-01-20T18:56:34] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Also, if he has two batteries 10s and 4s in series then it has (i hope) also two bms in each and need to make sure they are working correctly and settings also right. Does batteries are separately charged? And does the external one even charged to appropriate level at all (more, equal or a little less to internal)? Thats important. Also i hope that parallels of external battery is more or equal to internal one and has equal or similar to discharge current and capacity cells in it
[2023-01-20T19:07:34] Mauro Christian: the 36V battery pack is the original ninebot one and the series pack is made with 21700 lg cells
[2023-01-20T19:08:42] Mauro Christian: the batteries both have bms and are charged separately

[2023-01-20T22:27:07] Mauro Christian: but it should give me some parameters
[2023-01-20T23:18:56] Mauro Christian: ooooooook
[2023-01-20T23:20:20] Mauro Christian: I put on a 60v battery and redid all the configuration and I have all the data
[2023-01-20T23:21:16] Mauro Christian: and the scooter rides much better
[2023-01-20T23:27:39] Mauro Christian: for tonight thanks to the whole group I'll try again tomorrow

[2023-01-21T14:58:31] J√°nos T√≥th: Hi! Anyone having issues with the SPINTEND UBOX SINGLE 100100-s current sensors? Specificly the opamps after the shunt resistors? I ordered directly from the manufacturer 4 control board, 1 to replace my broken one ( it works, but nrf port is broken) and 3 to play with tham, making my own franken ESC. After it arriwed, I sadly realized, 3 of the 4 having current sensor issues. The automated offset mesurements created crazy low, ot crazy high values, and I discovered, that it has opamp problems! 3 of 4!!!üò≥ My question is, that it is a known issue, that this is a shit component choice, or spintend really sended me 3 bad one, which is very dissapointingü§¨...... I contacted with the manufacturer, and asked new boards, and later only to get half of my money back, but first sad I just connected incorrectly, than when I made videos about my right, they offerd a free repair, if I ship it back to their facilityüôÑ So I'm hier to look after better components maybe, because that is cheaper and much faster.... Hier is som pictures and videos about the problem, and also some videos, how its working, after I harvested some good opamps from my working one, and soldered to my freshly arrived bad ones.... https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cpRNPbbAEwq81dQL9v2ZrfLueY9Y3KW6
[2023-01-21T15:00:39] Mirono escooters: Well, vesc automatically detects offset What is "crazy high"?

[2023-01-21T15:01:39] Mirono escooters: 37 not xD

[2023-01-21T15:04:46] J√°nos T√≥th: After change, it goes back to normal. Until that I can't even use it, becous it stops with high ofsett differenc fault or something like that

[2023-01-22T11:56:42] ÿßÿ≠ŸÖÿØ: I tried to decrease the voltage of generic Chinese ebike controller to 12 volt using the formula in this topic but it never goes below 18 volt, even I used resistor with very low value but never decreased below 18 volt
[2023-01-22T12:03:20] S1m 0n: could be the voltage regulator sd4938 (Input:20V~150V,Output:12/15/18V,Current:0,5A)

[2023-01-22T13:51:06] Jan: Sorry but Xiaomi M365 with 11" makes no sense, that frame is way too tiny for that
[2023-01-22T13:51:28] Jan: Even Ninebot G30 with 11" is too tiny
[2023-01-22T13:51:41] rosheee: for?
[2023-01-22T14:57:22] Jason Nelson: If you can bulk it up with deck width and stem accessories it doesn't look so bad but bare bones max with big tires looks awkward
[2023-01-22T15:14:09] Jan: If you modify the frame that much, its not a Ninebot G30 anymore
[2023-01-22T15:14:45] Jason Nelson: Fair
[2023-01-22T15:15:11] Jason Nelson: I think suspension takes it post g30 as well. We're just working off a frame

[2023-01-24T20:46:06] Gordan Gizdic: Fuuuuck. Thats not thick. Thats baaad.
[2023-01-24T20:47:28] Gordan Gizdic: Just retarded.
[2023-01-24T20:47:36] Gordan Gizdic: Accident waiting to happen.
[2023-01-24T20:47:39] Mirono escooters: Good
[2023-01-24T20:48:44] Gordan Gizdic: Ive seen a couple of vsetts form cracks at the bottom of the stem. But even if it cracks there, theres still inner tube and it doesnt snap off.
[2023-01-24T20:49:31] Jan: Ugh thats a weird failure mode
[2023-01-24T20:49:43] Jan: Its so clean cut
[2023-01-24T20:49:58] Jan: Must be a fatigue failure from a crack
[2023-01-24T20:52:49] Luis Magalhaes: They want to do a low weight scooter but then it breaks üòÖ no mantis for me for sure
[2023-01-24T20:53:28] Luis Magalhaes: I prefer weight to break üòÇ
[2023-01-24T20:55:00] Jan: Well someone is getting fired over there
[2023-01-24T20:55:24] Mirono escooters: Nop

[2023-01-24T20:56:54] sombre_enfant: Its decent
[2023-01-24T20:57:19] sombre_enfant: No classic evo one
[2023-01-24T20:57:31] sombre_enfant: Its decent
[2023-01-24T20:58:24] sombre_enfant: Vsett pole is too long, gt u can retrofit sum else
[2023-01-24T20:58:50] sombre_enfant: Idk if i can shorten it somehow
[2023-01-24T21:01:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Warrior has like 1cm+ stem thickness
[2023-01-24T21:01:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Not to protect them at all üòÖ
[2023-01-24T21:03:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Probably thickness and double it makes it better But folding still not the best and cable management also , Front has like two finger hole under the plastic cover ,like they never heard off an O ringü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-01-24T21:09:22] sombre_enfant: Red cut then pull down the stem holder screw it back
[2023-01-24T21:09:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I think the minimotors one is crap also
[2023-01-24T21:10:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But i hate all these jerk controllersüòÖ
[2023-01-24T21:27:45] sombre_enfant: Do the same delta idk if its understandable im not good to explain, dont know if its any good on geometry. But must be less force as theres less lever (M*D)
[2023-01-24T21:34:14] sombre_enfant: Blue it dont ecist anymore Red straight cut Green new hole for screw Yellow the new stem emplacement Purple the tube who actually in the pole that u pull below
[2023-01-24T21:34:25] sombre_enfant: Crazy drawing skilll...
[2023-01-24T21:39:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What you show Above and has crack that's not welding, that a monkey playing on a machine
[2023-01-24T21:39:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You could never broke welding
[2023-01-24T21:39:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Above or under
[2023-01-24T21:40:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So maybe a good welder saves your ass
[2023-01-24T21:40:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You show some welding what was cracked
[2023-01-24T21:41:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Maybe it was different
[2023-01-24T21:44:46] sombre_enfant: Wait maybe im trippin but aint the pole to the stem assembly is in two part ? One square with one inside with the "31.8 adapter"
[2023-01-24T21:45:05] sombre_enfant: Well seems bad
[2023-01-24T21:46:38] sombre_enfant: I mean This withe the tube who go down in hold by two screw on each sidr
[2023-01-24T21:49:56] sombre_enfant: Yes
[2023-01-24T22:03:30] sombre_enfant: Didnt i got the whole frame laying in my room but im too lazy rn
[2023-01-24T22:03:33] sombre_enfant: Sorry
[2023-01-24T22:19:51] sombre_enfant: I said bs again dont seems to move without force with screw removed
[2023-01-24T22:22:09] sombre_enfant: By hand nope
[2023-01-24T22:22:23] sombre_enfant: I didnt try a mallet nor hammer

[2023-01-25T00:36:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Trickü§£
[2023-01-25T00:37:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: Low amps, long pulse
[2023-01-25T00:37:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2023-01-25T00:38:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: Sandwich method can break after some years due to oxidization
[2023-01-25T00:40:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: Copper can‚Äôt melt with nickel correctly because there‚Äôs no inert gas, that protect the welding from oxygen.
[2023-01-25T00:40:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: My method consists in brazing, best conduction and tin don‚Äôt oxidize
[2023-01-25T00:41:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, in the fact. But for correctly welding need inert gas like argon
[2023-01-25T00:41:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: Who do welding for job knows that
[2023-01-25T00:41:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: Like kaabo pole, maybe did with low quality inert gasüòÇ
[2023-01-25T00:43:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, but my pack wasn‚Äôt sealed , that‚Äôs why it breaks very quickly
[2023-01-25T00:55:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: No
[2023-01-25T00:55:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: Humidity is enough
[2023-01-25T01:12:32] Unknown: So I should use my argon welder gas with a hose blowing on weld lol.
[2023-01-25T01:15:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Idk if here‚Äôs risk of short circuit
[2023-01-25T01:24:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: But yes, battery copper welder uses argon and micro tig technology
[2023-01-25T01:48:15] Unknown: It's non conductive
[2023-01-25T01:48:47] Unknown: Wonder if I flooded area with gas when spot welding. Gonna have to test
[2023-01-25T06:57:04] Konstantin: Can...but need a lot of amps ;) Delete all photo/video, about my handmade spot welder..

[2023-01-25T14:22:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you‚Äôre welder, you know that need inert gas to melt correctly together two different material
[2023-01-25T14:22:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: Or welding is very very weak

[2023-01-26T13:43:43] Ohad Avishay Shatz: hello, having issues with inokim OX electric scooter and single ubox 75V 100A, while , trying to setup throttle to ADC1 and brake lever to ADC2( brake lever had only 2 wires ) , do i still choose current no reverse adc2 brake?
[2023-01-26T13:44:46] Ohad Avishay Shatz: no
[2023-01-26T13:45:36] Ohad Avishay Shatz: it must?
[2023-01-26T14:07:10] Konstantin: It's can xD, even with mix both if them
[2023-01-26T14:31:03] Ohad Avishay Shatz: any ideas guys?
[2023-01-26T15:04:23] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, thats right
[2023-01-26T16:06:23] Juice: hi, did you figure out what the issue is?
[2023-01-26T16:14:45] gil guy: Not found yet.. same problem for you?
[2023-01-26T16:15:10] Juice: yep im not sure yet if its 6.0 firmware or my throttle
[2023-01-26T16:15:35] Juice: rpm sweep through experiments worked fine in 5.0 but i had to update to 6 to setup throttle
[2023-01-26T16:19:55] Juice: for some reason rpm sweep doesnt want to work either anymore
[2023-01-26T16:50:01] Juice: well i originally flashed with firmware provided by ubox on their google drive, i flashed the one in vesc software, reset everything and redid setup and now it seems to be happening less
[2023-01-26T16:50:11] Juice: rpm sweep also works now
[2023-01-26T16:54:33] Juice: nvm it doesnt wtf.
[2023-01-26T17:00:29] Juice: ok so after setting up adc throttle it wont work anymore, alright..
[2023-01-26T17:03:33] Juice: yeah i think its my throttle?
[2023-01-26T17:20:30] Juice: Is there a way to plot adc input?
[2023-01-26T17:25:58] Mirono escooters: Somewhere

[2023-01-29T01:42:28] Mirko Boni: Although I stop the throttle he continues to run at flat power
[2023-01-29T01:42:49] Mirko Boni: do you think it could be a sensorless ERPM problem?

[2023-01-29T02:20:44] Mirko Boni: 5V - GND - ADC1
[2023-01-29T02:22:31] Mirko Boni: Roger suggested the commegment to me.
[2023-01-29T02:23:22] Mirko Boni: Tomorrow I will try to redo the throttle setup.
[2023-01-29T02:23:48] Mirko Boni: no, little focer vesc
[2023-01-29T02:24:59] Mirko Boni: The voltage goes up to 3.30 and when I leave it goes back to 0
[2023-01-29T02:26:20] Mirko Boni: Roger told me that I can install a 5V throttle
[2023-01-29T02:27:17] Mirko Boni: Roger told me that the little focer handles 3.3 and 5V accelerators
[2023-01-29T02:30:38] Mirko Boni: I have an ADC module, and I can install it
[2023-01-29T02:31:39] Mirko Boni: On the vesc little focer site there is not as much documentation
[2023-01-29T02:32:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Can‚Äôt be 0
[2023-01-29T02:32:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: Should be like 0.6 - 0.9
[2023-01-29T02:32:41] Mirko Boni: There is a problem, the little focer's connector is 7-pin, the ADC module na the 8-pin connector
[2023-01-29T02:33:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: And maximum from 2.5 to 3.3
[2023-01-29T02:33:31] Mirko Boni: Paul, it shows me 3.3
[2023-01-29T02:33:41] rosheee: no
[2023-01-29T02:33:45] rosheee: filter internal
[2023-01-29T02:34:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, but the minimum voltage is stranger
[2023-01-29T02:34:19] rosheee: connect
[2023-01-29T02:34:32] rosheee: never had peroblems
[2023-01-29T02:34:38] rosheee: GROUND + adc1 + 3.3v
[2023-01-29T02:34:43] Mirko Boni: What do you think this accelerated engine might be?
[2023-01-29T02:34:47] rosheee: not 5v
[2023-01-29T02:36:34] Mirko Boni: So according to you the problem is that I connected in the 5V pin?
[2023-01-29T02:36:43] rosheee: yes
[2023-01-29T02:37:22] rosheee: i never usaed 5v for throttle
[2023-01-29T02:37:22] Mirko Boni: Okay. I'll connect to the 3V pin tomorrow.
[2023-01-29T02:37:24] rosheee: always 3v
[2023-01-29T02:37:32] rosheee: o.O
[2023-01-29T02:38:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: 3.3v nominal, 3.6 maximum , 4v absolute maximum under break
[2023-01-29T02:38:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: If he see 3.3v, there‚Äôs no problem
[2023-01-29T02:38:42] Mirko Boni: I don't understand anything anymore.. üòî
[2023-01-29T02:39:19] rosheee: ^^'
[2023-01-29T02:39:22] Mirko Boni: I connected today to 3.3V and vesc tool read 3.3
[2023-01-29T02:39:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: Impossible 5v from throttle hall sensor
[2023-01-29T02:40:09] rosheee: ^^ also smells like something else
[2023-01-29T02:41:08] Mirko Boni: Tomorrow I connect my 5V accelerator to the 3.3V port.. let's hope it doesn't burn
[2023-01-29T02:41:54] rosheee: idk why hall sensor interference with throttle ^^'
[2023-01-29T02:42:05] rosheee: ubox same
[2023-01-29T02:42:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes but no possible to burn stmüòÇ
[2023-01-29T02:42:13] rosheee: 3.3v throttle 5v hall
[2023-01-29T02:43:14] Mirko Boni: But can connecting the accelerator to the 5V pin keep the engine accelerated to maximum for 5 seconds?
[2023-01-29T02:43:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes it‚Äôs not safe for long use. But if you connect and try one time there‚Äôs no problem
[2023-01-29T02:44:29] rosheee: ^^' so hall 5v and 3.3v throttle good
[2023-01-29T02:44:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: Il motore accelera al massimo se perde il segnale acceleratore, pu√≤ essere qualche connettore crimpato male, o cavo saldato male, o acceleratore difettoso
[2023-01-29T02:44:37] Mirko Boni: But do I have to connect to the 3.3V pin? And hell I don't understand.. Does it burn if I use it like this?
[2023-01-29T02:45:22] Mirko Boni: Aspetta Paolo, lo fa solo dopo che io inserisco le configurazioni che mi ha dato Roger.. Occhio
[2023-01-29T02:46:02] Mirko Boni: If I use it with the default configuration it doesn't stay accelerated..
[2023-01-29T02:46:33] Mirko Boni: Okay okay I get it
[2023-01-29T02:46:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: E quali sarebbero queste configurazioni?
[2023-01-29T02:47:13] Mirko Boni: Quelle che usa lui.. Sono tante pagine üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-01-29T02:47:28] Mirko Boni: Ti faccio screenshot

[2023-01-30T20:19:53] Mirko Boni: Good evening everyone, I am struggling with my single motor and vesc.. The motor is a vsett the vesc is a little focer. When the motor heats up it starts making noise and when accelerating the motor stalls. In your opinion is the engine faulty? The engine is 3 days old and new..
[2023-01-30T20:20:18] Mirko Boni: <video_file>
[2023-01-30T20:21:02] Mirono escooters: Halls maybe ? Going bad?
[2023-01-30T20:21:21] Mirko Boni: I thought about the hall sensors too
[2023-01-30T20:23:10] Santiago: It happened to me when overamping the motor
[2023-01-30T20:23:21] Santiago: Check that
[2023-01-30T20:24:00] Mirko Boni: What is Overamping?
[2023-01-30T20:25:39] Mirko Boni: Motor phase 130A, battery current 70A
[2023-01-30T20:26:16] Mirko Boni: The vesc setup was done by @roscheeee
[2023-01-30T20:27:10] Mirono escooters: Is good
[2023-01-30T20:27:23] Mirono escooters: Maybe shit soldering inside like with James
[2023-01-30T20:27:49] sombre_enfant: Where the motor from ?
[2023-01-30T20:28:21] Mirko Boni: I bought the engine in France from emobilityshop.com
[2023-01-30T20:28:44] Mirko Boni: Da emobilityshop.com
[2023-01-30T20:28:58] Santiago: I mean continuous current
[2023-01-30T20:29:14] Gordan Gizdic: Theres something loose in that motor for sure.
[2023-01-30T20:29:16] Mirko Boni: Yes, then I understood later üòÇüòÇ
[2023-01-30T20:29:24] Santiago: If too much it stutters when hot
[2023-01-30T20:29:44] Mirko Boni: Yesterday I reached 75 degrees externally
[2023-01-30T20:30:01] Gordan Gizdic: That 100+ internally.
[2023-01-30T20:30:05] Santiago: Check halls too
[2023-01-30T20:30:08] Mirko Boni: Exactly
[2023-01-30T20:30:14] Gordan Gizdic: Yup, something insidr is efed
[2023-01-30T20:30:14] Santiago: The connections u made
[2023-01-30T20:30:22] Mirko Boni: Do I have to disassemble the engine?
[2023-01-30T20:30:27] Santiago: Nope
[2023-01-30T20:30:28] Gordan Gizdic: Yup
[2023-01-30T20:30:34] Gordan Gizdic: I would.
[2023-01-30T20:30:55] Mirko Boni: Inside the scooter? Connections on the vesc?
[2023-01-30T20:31:03] Gordan Gizdic: What did you do to it to reach that temp on 130 phase?
[2023-01-30T20:31:16] Gordan Gizdic: Drove an hour uphill?
[2023-01-30T20:31:24] Santiago: I always solder the hall wires after crimping to reinforce
[2023-01-30T20:31:35] Mirko Boni: Yesterday I set 90A battery and 190A phase
[2023-01-30T20:31:38] Santiago: Yes
[2023-01-30T20:31:44] Mirko Boni: No no
[2023-01-30T20:32:07] Mirko Boni: I just soldered them.
[2023-01-30T20:32:37] Gordan Gizdic: Oh god. Nothing theres actually supposed to go that high. New motor? Was 3 days ago, now its prolly melted to fuck.
[2023-01-30T20:32:59] Mirko Boni: So inside is it loose?
[2023-01-30T20:33:12] Gordan Gizdic: Burnt, loose... Yes, for sure.
[2023-01-30T20:33:21] Gordan Gizdic: I wonder how the esc survived
[2023-01-30T20:33:38] Gordan Gizdic: Probably thermally throttled like crazy.
[2023-01-30T20:33:47] Gordan Gizdic: 190 is tooo much.
[2023-01-30T20:33:47] Mirko Boni: The esc had no problems.
[2023-01-30T20:33:57] Gordan Gizdic: Oh, pure luck.
[2023-01-30T20:34:23] Mirko Boni: In the dual motor with the vsett engines and the vesc I have never had any problems..
[2023-01-30T20:34:25] Gordan Gizdic: Vsett motors, max 160 phase amps for short duration, 150 for mid and 140 for long
[2023-01-30T20:34:40] Gordan Gizdic: At 190 phase and 90 batt?
[2023-01-30T20:34:45] Gordan Gizdic: Impossible
[2023-01-30T20:34:48] Mirko Boni: Ok ok.. Thanks for your help..
[2023-01-30T20:35:06] Mirko Boni: Yess I confirm the data
[2023-01-30T20:35:43] Gordan Gizdic: Go open the motor. Something is loose. Maybe you can save it.
[2023-01-30T20:35:48] Gordan Gizdic: But maybe.
[2023-01-30T20:36:18] Mirko Boni: I buy it new.. I don't understand anything about engines
[2023-01-30T20:44:24] Mirko Boni: Are you saying it's a phase issue?
[2023-01-30T20:47:23] Gordan Gizdic: Its a burnt to crisp situation.
[2023-01-30T20:49:00] Mirko Boni: Yes james.. It started after I used the 190A
[2023-01-30T20:50:33] Mirko Boni: Maybe I'll buy a new engine
[2023-01-30T20:50:49] Mirko Boni: Ok ok I get it..
[2023-01-30T20:51:11] Mirko Boni: I'm not good with electric motors
[2023-01-30T20:53:08] Mirko Boni: Thanks for the help james
[2023-01-30T20:56:01] Mirko Boni: Do you think without sensors it can work well?

[2023-01-30T22:50:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So basically is at very start?
[2023-01-30T22:50:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: How you know?
[2023-01-30T22:52:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Or this after crazy trip?
[2023-01-30T22:53:56] Mirko Boni: After using the 190A phase scooter this happened. I brought the maximum speed for 1 km,m the motor heated up
[2023-01-30T22:54:42] Mirko Boni: Now, when the engine is cold, everything works fine, but when the engine warms up then the problems begin
[2023-01-30T23:00:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I see
[2023-01-30T23:00:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Maybe wire thickness different also what's on stock that Rs had also what James said poor soldering ü§î
[2023-01-30T23:11:42] Mirko Boni: Do you know where I can buy a vsett 10 engine in Europe? In france they don't ship to italy anymore
[2023-01-30T23:12:29] Mirko Boni: I found a site that sells vsett engine, but it is in lithuania, does anyone know it?

[2023-01-30T23:30:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: No buddy sry ,mine from RS Might consider 60h Unsure what @PaoloWu has and he is from Italy
[2023-01-30T23:31:22] Mirko Boni: Paolo has no vsett engines
[2023-01-30T23:33:17] Mirko Boni: Tu hai amici che vendono?
[2023-01-30T23:33:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yeah 60 h even Stronger ,but he can explain better
[2023-01-30T23:33:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: No possible to drive with single vesc
[2023-01-30T23:34:04] Mirko Boni: Why never?
[2023-01-30T23:34:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: Torque is too weak for single motor configuration
[2023-01-30T23:34:12] Mirko Boni: Can you explain me the reason?
[2023-01-30T23:34:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: High Kv motors are no suggested for single motor
[2023-01-30T23:34:42] Mirko Boni: In truth, my engine has a nice torque when it runs
[2023-01-30T23:34:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: I mean my 60h
[2023-01-30T23:34:56] Mirko Boni: What engine do you recommend?
[2023-01-30T23:35:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not vsett one
[2023-01-30T23:35:39] Mirko Boni: Ok.. But which engine do you recommend?
[2023-01-30T23:52:56] Mirko Boni: I wrote to you privately
[2023-01-31T00:04:03] Mirko Boni: guys, one piece of information, what high torque motors can they fit on the G30? Since the vsett motor has high kv, is there any other motor?
[2023-01-31T11:03:47] Santiago: My vsett motor desagrees

[2023-01-31T11:36:49] Gordan Gizdic: A bit of testing on my VSETT 10.
[2023-01-31T11:37:17] Gordan Gizdic: Cant complain, nice results for 3 degrees of outside temp.
[2023-01-31T11:40:14] sombre_enfant: What are your setting ? U dont use fw ?
[2023-01-31T11:42:13] Gordan Gizdic: I do. 20A per ESC.
[2023-01-31T11:42:23] Gordan Gizdic: With no FW, max was 69.
[2023-01-31T11:42:32] Gordan Gizdic: So yeah, it is doing something.
[2023-01-31T11:43:01] Gordan Gizdic: But top speed wasnt the main test today. I could have gotten a bit more if i held it longer.
[2023-01-31T16:17:30] Mirono escooters: Even sensorless??
[2023-01-31T16:18:08] Mirko Boni: Yess Mirono
[2023-01-31T16:29:11] Mirko Boni: But with the engine cold I tried starting with 150A phase and 80A battery.. The problem did not occur..
[2023-01-31T16:29:53] Mirko Boni: Then I selected 130A of phase and 60A of battery
[2023-01-31T16:30:16] Mirko Boni: Yess
[2023-01-31T21:58:22] S1m 0n: To make another display executable, (with the rPi vesc Display) I only have to adapt these files? In my case 800x480, so also the elements and positions increased by a factor of 1.25? 800/640*X ? @roscheeee

[2023-02-01T13:29:30] Mirono escooters: My friend soldered it. Got for free
[2023-02-01T13:30:57] Mirono escooters: Maybe
[2023-02-01T13:30:59] Mirono escooters: Idk
[2023-02-01T13:31:08] Mirono escooters: I dont have a project for it tbh
[2023-02-01T13:31:09] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-02-01T13:36:10] Mirono escooters: Nah
[2023-02-01T13:36:21] Mirono escooters: That one go more phase amps
[2023-02-01T14:00:24] Mirono escooters: Replace em all
[2023-02-01T14:00:25] Mirono escooters: Don't mix
[2023-02-01T14:00:34] Mirono escooters: Show us the mos
[2023-02-01T14:07:09] sombre_enfant: Need datasheet But wont do power upgrade may a little more efficiency
[2023-02-01T16:01:12] Mirko Boni: Hello guys
[2023-02-01T16:01:14] Mirko Boni: Now while I'm walking with the scooter and I'm going at a quiet speed I hear a noise like "tac' behind Suddenly the scooter no longer responds to the accelerator In the vesc tools display the speed remains blocked I send you a video‚Äå‚Äå Traduzione: en-it Mirko Boni: Adesso mentre cammino con lo scooter e vado a bassa velocit√† sento un rumore tipo "tac' dietro All'improvviso lo scooter non risponde pi√π all'acceleratore Nella visualizzazione degli strumenti vesc la velocit√† rimane bloccata Ti mando un video‚Äå‚Äå
[2023-02-01T16:01:23] Mirko Boni: <video_file>
[2023-02-01T16:03:32] Mirono escooters: Is motor turning freely
[2023-02-01T16:03:45] Mirko Boni: I've been struggling with the noise problem in the vsett engine for a week when I accelerate from a standstill at the start.. Do you think this block is the fault of the engine or the vesc?
[2023-02-01T16:04:01] Mirko Boni: Yess.. It is not blocked
[2023-02-01T16:10:47] Mirko Boni: This "tac" noise comes from the engine.. In the display the vesc freezes and therefore I am worried that it is not the faulty vesc..
[2023-02-01T17:03:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I would say sure
[2023-02-01T17:04:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Maybe but dumb bldc with zero settings

[2023-02-01T17:09:00] Mirono escooters: And I dont. I feel
[2023-02-01T17:09:06] Mirono escooters: It's higher then 200a, for sure
[2023-02-01T17:30:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Does contoller define its battery amps ?

[2023-02-01T17:31:44] Mirono escooters: 200a phase wasn't super special, just fun With this, ooh boy, if I don't lean forward, I do a wheelie. makes you think.
[2023-02-01T17:31:52] Mirono escooters: Yes, until I shunt modded it
[2023-02-01T17:31:57] Mirono escooters: Luckily Bluetooth bms

[2023-02-01T17:47:19] Mirono escooters: No, I did it with some calculations
[2023-02-01T17:47:30] Mirono escooters: I had 2, added equivalent of another, approx
[2023-02-01T17:47:44] Mirono escooters: But bldc just peaks fucking high and it's confused, 60a max with 70-80% throttle

(5 turns) Rear : burned the stock ox motor (A type), gave it to a friend for a rewind, he put more copper inside, number of turns stayed the same (4 turns) manufacturer stated that its 800w, stock was measured 22.5kV, pretty sure it didn't changed after the rewind. Both are with 55mm wide stator, 5mil of ferrofluid and custom cooling (can be seen in the photo i sent), so far pushing 16kW (on both), both are 10", pmt tyres

[2023-02-03T02:37:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well ,she has damn such a flow, that i dont need to understand words , i know I like different kind also but suprised on her ,also here she would be in jail for such
[2023-02-03T02:39:45] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Yeah it's true, she have nice flow, it's rare for french Rap üòÜ
[2023-02-03T02:43:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Kinda only one i know for sure
[2023-02-03T02:44:03] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: I like some Title of Orelsan, but i it's all
[2023-02-03T02:44:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Maybe but unsure ,Ron shuno use to say something in his songs whats sounds French sentence but unsure
[2023-02-03T02:45:35] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: you seem more interested by French music than the contr√¥le of the music himself haha
[2023-02-03T02:47:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well it came up and i now looked on guy you said , didn't enjoy ,i would cut his hair üòÖ
[2023-02-03T02:47:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I am interested in lot things
[2023-02-03T02:48:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: How you switch music show us if possible
[2023-02-03T02:48:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also if not urgent ,but like on screen added button
[2023-02-03T02:49:54] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: <video_file>
[2023-02-03T02:50:11] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: You have two button, with simple or double clic fonction, and you set in parameter what you want want one clic on button 1 or 2, and for double clic
[2023-02-03T02:53:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Nice, nice
[2023-02-03T02:56:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Even in handy position, hate when i have to mess with volume +- and doesnt happen immidiatly and i am on one hand ,finding all shit on road in does seconds üòÖ
[2023-02-03T02:59:19] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it's reactive, less than 1 sec , we will make vid√©o when we will be ready for the sell
[2023-02-03T03:00:01] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but to be honest, actually for Volume +/- it's not usable, because you need clic, wait, clic wait, clic, wait to down or up the volume
[2023-02-03T03:00:10] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: The same for the Regulator
[2023-02-03T03:00:28] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but it will change in the futur
[2023-02-03T03:00:44] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but for all the fonction on/off it's nice

[2023-02-03T13:50:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Just side question,maybe buttons cant do it ,but you know better
[2023-02-03T13:50:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Long press option?
[2023-02-03T13:50:59] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: long press is fixed for boost on the button 1, and nothing on the button 2
[2023-02-03T13:51:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Boost?
[2023-02-03T13:51:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Max speed unlock? Or similar
[2023-02-03T13:51:47] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yeah, when you press all is unlimited, no speed limit, no torque limit
[2023-02-03T13:52:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: üò¢ does would be nice for volume
[2023-02-03T13:52:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: How About
[2023-02-03T13:52:27] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it's when you like cruise with speed limit and you need acc√©l√©ration quickly
[2023-02-03T13:52:34] Face de Pin Suc√©: Long press on button 2 is lock x)
[2023-02-03T13:52:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Both long press same time is max speed
[2023-02-03T13:52:48] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: ah yes true, I forgot ü•¥
[2023-02-03T13:53:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: One long press is down or up? Maybe thats an option
[2023-02-03T13:57:08] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: I suggest it at the d√©velopper, it's also more logic for me, but it's d√©pend how much work it this to modified
[2023-02-03T15:01:05] Gigolo Joe: Affects kV, acceleration and in some cases- controller temperature. more turns - faster acceleration, lower top speed Less turns - slower acceleration, higher top speed At some point, the acceleration becomes the same
[2023-02-03T15:12:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: And some points , the high Kv one more acceleration
[2023-02-03T15:12:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: Here need a curve to explain how Kv affects
[2023-02-03T17:16:16] Mirko Boni: Good morning everyone.. I disassembled the vsett engine.. Can you tell me what you think is the situation?

[2023-02-03T17:17:38] Mirono escooters: As always Man, how come they do this
[2023-02-03T17:17:42] Mirono escooters: @jamessoderstrom
[2023-02-03T17:17:54] Mirono escooters: Redo it you will see much improvement
[2023-02-03T17:18:13] Mirono escooters: It even discolored ü§®üíî Not buying vsett motors after this
[2023-02-03T17:22:18] Mirono escooters: Heat...
[2023-02-03T17:22:48] Mirko Boni: Hello Mirono
[2023-02-03T17:22:57] Mirono escooters: Helo
[2023-02-03T17:23:01] Mirko Boni: So do you think I have to redo the welds?
[2023-02-03T17:23:14] Mirono escooters: 100%
[2023-02-03T17:24:10] Mirono escooters: It will fix the issue
[2023-02-03T17:24:35] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-02-03T17:24:52] Mirko Boni: So I just have to weld the phases and close the motor?
[2023-02-03T17:24:58] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-02-03T17:25:19] Mirko Boni: hall sensors?
[2023-02-03T17:25:28] Mirko Boni: I have to do something?
[2023-02-03T17:25:31] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-02-03T17:25:36] Mirko Boni: Ok ok
[2023-02-03T17:25:52] Mirko Boni: Do you have any tutorials for soldering phases?
[2023-02-03T17:27:02] Mirono escooters: Use a lighter to burn enamel off
[2023-02-03T17:27:06] Mirono escooters: And use high W iron
[2023-02-03T17:27:34] Mirko Boni: Do you need the classic tin?
[2023-02-03T17:27:50] Mirono escooters: W flux
[2023-02-03T17:27:53] Mirono escooters: Bad boy
[2023-02-03T17:28:02] Mirono escooters: Use a flame thingy
[2023-02-03T17:28:15] Mirono escooters: More flame üòú
[2023-02-03T17:28:30] Mirko Boni: Is it a particular pond? My pond already has flux in it
[2023-02-03T17:29:07] Mirono escooters: Ye
[2023-02-03T17:29:11] Mirono escooters: Good
[2023-02-03T17:29:45] Mirko Boni: One last question, do you have a photo of the welded phases?
[2023-02-03T17:31:28] Mirono escooters: No sorry
[2023-02-03T17:31:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs why I never liked huameng company
[2023-02-03T17:34:26] Mirko Boni: Okay okay thanks
[2023-02-03T17:43:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You can see this lot times on different things
[2023-02-03T17:48:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: Huameng has good metal quality, and tolerance, bearing etc. But xd the rest is shit, small rotor, bad soldering , double magnets and in their top models you can‚Äôt fit normal bike discsüòÇüòÇ
[2023-02-03T17:50:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Usually not hand soldering with even wrong tin and they try to add the less ass possible, while copper even not joined well Its more like just sticking the end to solder and let dry. On simple wire(bowden) brake's the end of it is soldered the same shittty way, 15 years ago 3 cm long soldering was on the endü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-02-03T17:51:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I think he mean does what has a shoulder
[2023-02-03T17:52:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Flat ones you can but ,the ones what has a bit moved center no go
[2023-02-03T17:54:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But just one question near a disc's how many of you seen or have a disc where they tell how much you tighen every bolt with a torque wrench?
[2023-02-03T19:19:59] S1m 0n: what is your experience with angyang? kaabo engine manufacturer
[2023-02-03T19:34:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ly made only 11inch 60v one
[2023-02-03T19:34:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: Good but 10 inch crap wheel material

[2023-02-03T22:55:16] Mirko Boni: Yes, I still have to clean up
[2023-02-03T22:55:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I use to put fiber stuff all around like a surgery,than easy cleaning
[2023-02-03T22:57:33] Mirko Boni: It's the first time I've done this in an engine
[2023-02-03T23:05:15] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_7643@03-02-2023_23-05-15.jpg>
[2023-02-03T23:05:26] Mirko Boni: What does it look like to you?
[2023-02-03T23:06:41] Santiago: Looks good
[2023-02-03T23:07:04] Santiago: Now remove solder balls are the coils
[2023-02-03T23:07:58] Mirko Boni: Yess.. I have to clean everything well
[2023-02-03T23:08:02] Santiago: And next time cover them with something so yo don't have these shorting stuff
[2023-02-03T23:08:25] Mirko Boni: You're right .. Unfortunately I'm an inexperienced
[2023-02-03T23:10:52] Santiago: I guess you putting the phase cover back in too
[2023-02-04T00:10:08] Mirko Boni: Yes, I put the hoses back in place
[2023-02-04T00:11:14] Santiago: Perfect

[2023-02-04T02:13:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well there is Always a start, i just said to cover the rest to help you for next time
[2023-02-04T02:14:39] Mirko Boni: Sure.. I understood your advice.. I'm just sorry I didn't think before doing this
[2023-02-04T18:08:30] Mirko Boni: Good evening everyone, I have installed the motor with the phases welded.. Here is the result
[2023-02-04T18:08:39] Mirko Boni: <video_file>
[2023-02-04T18:09:28] Mirono escooters: üò±
[2023-02-04T18:09:36] Mirko Boni: like the other times as the engine warms up the noise problem starts
[2023-02-04T18:09:46] Mirono escooters: Have you tried different observation things?
[2023-02-04T18:09:50] Mirko Boni: <sticker>
[2023-02-04T18:09:52] Mirono escooters: It sounds like when my halls did shit
[2023-02-04T18:10:13] rosheee: XD wtf
[2023-02-04T18:10:36] rosheee: noise problem from engine?
[2023-02-04T18:10:46] Mirko Boni: Unfortunately, every time the engine warms up, the mess arrives
[2023-02-04T18:10:48] rosheee: there is a solution for it
[2023-02-04T18:10:50] rosheee: yes ^^
[2023-02-04T18:10:52] rosheee: i know that :D
[2023-02-04T18:11:02] rosheee: there are 4 solutions
[2023-02-04T18:11:14] Mirko Boni: <sticker>
[2023-02-04T18:11:45] Mirko Boni: the first solution is to throw the scooter off the mountain
[2023-02-04T18:12:32] rosheee: 1. ferrofluid 2. less amps üòÜ 3. higher zero vector frequency 4. saturation compensation mode + factor
[2023-02-04T18:13:37] Mirko Boni: do I have to apply all these solutions together?
[2023-02-04T18:13:42] rosheee: no
[2023-02-04T18:13:47] rosheee: try 1. first
[2023-02-04T18:13:52] rosheee: then 3.
[2023-02-04T18:14:00] rosheee: then 4.
[2023-02-04T18:14:08] rosheee: and if still wtf then 2. ^^'
[2023-02-04T18:14:18] rosheee: ah and after step 1 add temp. sensor üòÉ
[2023-02-04T18:14:34] Mirono escooters: Less amps? He's lower then what most do .
[2023-02-04T18:14:35] Mirko Boni: ok ok
[2023-02-04T18:14:41] Mirono escooters: Try different observator first
[2023-02-04T18:14:53] rosheee: ^^ he use ortega original
[2023-02-04T18:14:57] rosheee: i hope
[2023-02-04T18:15:04] rosheee: i didn't checked the video
[2023-02-04T18:15:12] Mirko Boni: yess ortega

[2023-02-04T18:16:22] rosheee: lol
[2023-02-04T18:16:30] rosheee: XD he could push much more
[2023-02-04T18:16:33] rosheee: vesc can't be fucked
[2023-02-04T18:16:44] rosheee: u hear the error in the video?
[2023-02-04T18:16:50] rosheee: ok
[2023-02-04T18:16:51] Mirko Boni: Heyyy... I put those values ‚Äã‚Äãbecause we talked about it together
[2023-02-04T18:16:52] rosheee: let me check
[2023-02-04T18:17:01] rosheee: u choose large outrunner?
[2023-02-04T18:17:26] Mirko Boni: Yess
[2023-02-04T18:17:26] Mirono escooters: Recalibrate when motor is hot and check what values changed.
[2023-02-04T18:17:50] Mirko Boni: Are you me gauge the engine is better
[2023-02-04T18:18:26] Mirono escooters: I don't understand
[2023-02-04T18:18:31] Mirono escooters: Redo motor setup when it's hot
[2023-02-04T18:18:35] Mirono escooters: And compare with when cold
[2023-02-04T18:18:37] Mirono escooters: That will tell
[2023-02-04T18:18:38] Mirko Boni: Yess
[2023-02-04T18:18:45] Mirko Boni: I did this
[2023-02-04T18:19:00] Mirko Boni: Everything works fine
[2023-02-04T18:19:25] Mirono escooters: But, what values are different
[2023-02-04T18:19:34] Mirko Boni: So is it useless to try another vesc?
[2023-02-04T18:19:41] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-02-04T18:19:49] Mirono escooters: But most likely won't change
[2023-02-04T18:19:59] Mirko Boni: The automatic phase Amps.. Are lower
[2023-02-04T18:20:07] rosheee: hmm
[2023-02-04T18:20:10] rosheee: he should fuck the motors more
[2023-02-04T18:20:18] rosheee: XD WHAT
[2023-02-04T18:20:28] Mirko Boni: @roscheeee
[2023-02-04T18:20:43] Mirono escooters: UwU imagine stator/hals
[2023-02-04T18:20:52] Mirko Boni: This is today's temperature
[2023-02-04T18:21:11] Mirko Boni: 130A phase and 70A battery
[2023-02-04T18:22:05] rosheee: wtf xD
[2023-02-04T18:22:22] rosheee: but i pushed 190A cont. + 100A battery ^^'
[2023-02-04T18:22:25] rosheee: for 25km
[2023-02-04T18:22:33] rosheee: motors weren't happy
[2023-02-04T18:22:40] rosheee: and started making sad noise when warm
[2023-02-04T18:22:44] Mirko Boni: This is singles remember
[2023-02-04T18:22:44] rosheee: yah but still xD
[2023-02-04T18:22:47] rosheee: 2x this
[2023-02-04T18:22:58] rosheee: still pushing 2x 10-12kw
[2023-02-04T18:23:30] Mirko Boni: Solution? Statorades?
[2023-02-04T18:23:49] Mirko Boni: @roscheeee
[2023-02-04T18:24:07] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_7644@04-02-2023_18-15-57.jpg>
[2023-02-04T18:37:39] Mirko Boni: There is also another problem that you have not seen, when the engine is hot, and the speed is around 12/13 km/h, the engine makes a noise and loses power
[2023-02-04T18:37:51] Mirko Boni: Listen to the first video again
[2023-02-04T18:38:06] Mirko Boni: <video_file>
[2023-02-04T18:41:00] S1m 0n: sounds like a motor when trying to spin a kaabo motor with a zero controller. always "stuttered" a bit under 15kmh until I soldered in other Hall sensors
[2023-02-04T18:41:57] Mirko Boni: So you think it's a hall sensor problem?
[2023-02-04T19:05:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: Set erpm sensorless up to 3000erpm
[2023-02-04T19:06:41] Mirko Boni: Do you think this solves the starting noise?
[2023-02-04T19:11:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: Try it then you will know
[2023-02-04T19:12:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: Go to hall sensor page and try detection with 50A, then write setup and save
[2023-02-04T19:14:49] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_7646@04-02-2023_19-14-49.jpg>
[2023-02-04T19:14:58] Mirko Boni: This Page?
[2023-02-04T19:15:52] Mirono escooters: How that fixes it?
[2023-02-04T19:15:55] Mirono escooters: For me lowering xorked
[2023-02-04T19:17:21] Mirko Boni: By lowering the phase Amps?
[2023-02-04T19:17:51] Mirono escooters: No lowering erpm
[2023-02-04T19:20:10] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_7647@04-02-2023_19-20-10.jpg>
[2023-02-04T19:20:26] Gordan Gizdic: 700/15 is what?
[2023-02-04T19:20:44] Gordan Gizdic: 46 rpm.
[2023-02-04T19:20:58] Gordan Gizdic: Thats the point where it goes from sensored to sensorless.
[2023-02-04T19:21:19] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_7648@04-02-2023_19-21-19.jpg>
[2023-02-04T19:22:00] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Sensorless erpm
[2023-02-04T19:22:03] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Paolo said it
[2023-02-04T19:22:09] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: .
[2023-02-04T19:24:31] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_7649@04-02-2023_19-24-31.jpg>
[2023-02-04T19:24:43] Mirko Boni: √à corretto?
[2023-02-04T19:24:50] Mirono escooters: He
[2023-02-04T19:24:51] Mirono escooters: Ye
[2023-02-04T19:27:19] Mirko Boni: Woow
[2023-02-04T19:27:26] Mirko Boni: It seems to work
[2023-02-04T19:30:35] Gordan Gizdic: Ofc.
[2023-02-04T19:30:42] Gordan Gizdic: It was switching too early.
[2023-02-04T19:30:48] Gordan Gizdic: And loosing position on phases
[2023-02-04T19:31:11] Mirono escooters: 500 is indeed low
[2023-02-04T19:31:27] Gordan Gizdic: 700 is 4.4kmh.
[2023-02-04T19:31:34] Gordan Gizdic: So 500 is less.. about 3kmh.
[2023-02-04T19:31:47] Gordan Gizdic: Thats not good for tracking and it starts doing this.
[2023-02-04T19:32:09] Gordan Gizdic: Sending impulses too early or too late.
[2023-02-04T19:32:22] Mirko Boni: Thank you all.. Thank you @PaoloWu
[2023-02-04T19:32:42] Mirko Boni: 3000 is working very well
[2023-02-04T19:32:52] Gordan Gizdic: Thats stock value
[2023-02-04T19:33:05] Mirko Boni: But now I lower the phase and the battery
[2023-02-04T19:33:09] Gordan Gizdic: Just enough to get some back emf so the vesc can track sensorless
[2023-02-04T19:33:23] Mirko Boni: Ok ok now I understand
[2023-02-04T19:40:13] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_7650@04-02-2023_19-40-13.jpg>
[2023-02-04T19:40:25] Mirko Boni: I'm doing the new configuration
[2023-02-04T19:42:13] Mirko Boni: Yess.. Thanks James
[2023-02-04T19:48:06] Mirko Boni: Field weakening?
[2023-02-04T19:48:27] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_7651@04-02-2023_19-48-27.jpg>
[2023-02-04T19:50:35] Mirko Boni: Does the Field warm up the engine?
[2023-02-04T19:50:55] Mirko Boni: Okay okay fine
[2023-02-04T19:56:48] Mirko Boni: Mmm.. I tried.. The weakening instead gives me 10 km/h
[2023-02-04T19:58:24] S1m 0n: Ten is not to bad
[2023-02-04T20:01:31] Mirko Boni: 45A
[2023-02-04T20:01:35] Mirko Boni: Exactly
[2023-02-04T20:06:51] rosheee: ok wtf üòÜthat brrrrrrrrrt sound
[2023-02-04T20:19:07] Mirko Boni: I set 20A of FW, 140A of phase and 70A of battery.. What do you think?
[2023-02-04T20:19:19] Gordan Gizdic: Reasonable
[2023-02-04T20:19:23] Gordan Gizdic: Thats ok.
[2023-02-04T20:19:34] Gordan Gizdic: Im running the same, just dual.
[2023-02-04T20:19:46] Gordan Gizdic: Youll get 73/74kmh.
[2023-02-04T20:19:59] Gordan Gizdic: But set fw at 85-89%
[2023-02-04T20:20:01] Mirko Boni: Do you think the engine will be warm with these settings?
[2023-02-04T20:20:14] Gordan Gizdic: This will help with acceleration after 55kmh.
[2023-02-04T20:20:29] Mirko Boni: I send you a photo
[2023-02-04T20:20:32] Gordan Gizdic: And yeah, 140 phase is ok for this weather.
[2023-02-04T20:21:03] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_7652@04-02-2023_20-21-03.jpg>
[2023-02-04T20:21:19] Gordan Gizdic: Raise ramp time to 800ms.
[2023-02-04T20:21:29] Gordan Gizdic: Just to soften the shock on the battery.
[2023-02-04T20:22:10] Gordan Gizdic: After 55-60 kmh youll feel slight boost.
[2023-02-04T20:22:16] Gordan Gizdic: Will accelerate a bit better.
[2023-02-04T20:22:23] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_7653@04-02-2023_20-22-23.jpg>
[2023-02-04T20:22:28] Gordan Gizdic: Yup
[2023-02-04T20:22:31] Gordan Gizdic: Thats it.
[2023-02-04T20:22:50] Mirko Boni: Thank you with all my heart
[2023-02-04T20:40:14] Mirono escooters: Isn't it weird to set field weakening with duty and not with rpm?
[2023-02-04T20:41:29] rosheee: True
[2023-02-04T20:41:33] rosheee: But u can change it
[2023-02-04T20:41:46] rosheee: Just change im vesc code duty to erpm
[2023-02-04T20:46:37] Mirono escooters: Ok
[2023-02-04T20:46:52] Mirono escooters: But makes no sense effici√´nty wise
[2023-02-04T20:47:40] Mirono escooters: About effici√´nt going to high speed
[2023-02-04T20:48:12] Mirono escooters: When you give full power, duty high, but speed low, so you already loose power w field weakening when you don't use field weakening yet If u use rpm to set it, it starts no matter if u go full power or not.
[2023-02-04T20:52:53] Mirko Boni: I don't know these settings.
[2023-02-04T20:53:06] Mirko Boni: I use the ones Roger gave me
[2023-02-04T20:53:51] Mirono escooters: Ok
[2023-02-04T20:54:22] Mirko Boni: But I only use the FW screen
[2023-02-04T20:54:41] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_7652@04-02-2023_20-21-03.jpg>
[2023-02-04T20:55:14] Mirono escooters: It's ok
[2023-02-04T20:55:49] Mirko Boni: Ok üòä
[2023-02-04T21:59:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I am even Unsure that he set ortega, if not whole works full different and sweet point at high numbers
[2023-02-04T22:00:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also pls answer pm
[2023-02-04T22:52:46] Mirko Boni: Yes, I set ortega..
[2023-02-04T22:53:23] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_7651@04-02-2023_19-48-27.jpg>
[2023-02-04T22:58:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And how much is sensorless erpm?
[2023-02-04T23:05:32] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_7656@04-02-2023_23-05-32.jpg>
[2023-02-04T23:05:41] Mirko Boni: This screen?
[2023-02-04T23:16:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yeah
[2023-02-04T23:16:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Put 500
[2023-02-04T23:16:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And 300 for second
[2023-02-04T23:17:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Will just shift faster to sensorless,
[2023-02-04T23:44:46] Mirko Boni: In truth it is thanks to the 3000 that we have solved the problem..
[2023-02-04T23:45:13] Mirko Boni: Before it was 500 and it had the defect
[2023-02-04T23:45:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Strange
[2023-02-04T23:45:48] Mirono escooters: Yep I find strange too but wotks
[2023-02-04T23:45:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: How much is frequency?
[2023-02-04T23:46:19] Mirko Boni: If I put 500 and try to accelerate it is the defect
[2023-02-04T23:46:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Before changing to ortega and bemf even needs 7000 ish
[2023-02-04T23:46:29] Mirko Boni: If I put 3000 it's fine
[2023-02-04T23:48:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: How much is zero vector frequency? Can you look up on that
[2023-02-04T23:48:54] Mirko Boni: Can you help me? Where can I find the screenshot?
[2023-02-04T23:50:28] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_7657@04-02-2023_23-50-28.jpg>
[2023-02-04T23:51:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I see ü§î lower than i thought
[2023-02-04T23:51:48] Mirko Boni: It is the automatic setting
[2023-02-04T23:54:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Higher frequency the more effective drive of the motor but me brainless tired and kinda sicküòÖ
[2023-02-04T23:54:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But higher makes more heat,so it can be that its already too high for it
[2023-02-04T23:57:00] Mirko Boni: So it's better to keep this value..
[2023-02-05T00:04:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You can try like 16 k or 25
[2023-02-05T00:10:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also what are your amp settings?
[2023-02-05T00:10:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Sry maybe told earlier
[2023-02-05T00:11:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: ü§î should look up on your setup via server Works like teamviewer
[2023-02-05T00:13:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: Now works @mirkus74 ?
[2023-02-05T00:14:34] Mirko Boni: Si Paolo.. Funziona benissimo.. Per√≤ devo essere sincero, io l'ho provato in casa.. Il motore era leggermente tiepido non caldo
[2023-02-05T00:14:45] Mirko Boni: Yes Paolo.. It works very well.. But I have to be honest, I tried it at home.. The engine was slightly warm, not hot
[2023-02-05T00:17:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs basically motor saturation, sensorless erpm is when vesc start to control motor without hall sensor
[2023-02-05T00:17:36] Mirko Boni: I'm writing it to you in Italian because I'm afraid I won't succeed in English
[2023-02-05T00:19:09] Mirko Boni: Con il valore di 700, dopo il tuo consiglio, ho tenuto il monopattino con la forza accelerando ed ha iniziato a sgranare, ho inserito 3000 e non solo non fa pi√π il rumore, ma adesso non riesco pi√π a tenerlo..
[2023-02-05T00:19:23] Mirko Boni: With the value of 700, after your advice, I held the scooter by force accelerating and it started to grain, I entered 3000 and not only does it no longer make the noise, but now I can't hold it anymore..
[2023-02-05T11:17:47] Unknown: Hey guys. I'm just a lil eScooter repair tech looking for help and knowledge. I hope you guys don't mind my questions that will inevitably ensue
[2023-02-05T11:18:32] Unknown: I come from a history of eSk8 though so I have quite a bit of experience with VESC if anyone needs help.

[2023-02-05T11:37:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You can tell that also if you like, i have nice mate from there in the scooter world ,just different chat
[2023-02-05T11:41:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also hiüòÅ No we dont mind ,chat based on vesc And that can connect, to basically anything. Near this everyone has some knowledge around what he has , also lot of us working around this business
[2023-02-05T11:44:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Mostly ppl in here having eScooter's or bike's
[2023-02-05T11:45:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Near thisü§îü§îü§î you have snow ,you could make a e-snowboard

[2023-02-05T17:14:00] Mirko Boni: Shit
[2023-02-05T17:15:13] Mirko Boni: I did the auto setup again.. Nothing changed

[2023-02-05T17:19:20] rosheee: I tested before
[2023-02-05T17:19:21] rosheee: 6.0

[2023-02-05T18:12:35] Jake: Hi all. I've been playing around with VESCs for a while and created the custom "jaykup" firmware for the Flipsky 75100 (and now 75200). Cool to see all the mods being done here. That forced air copper/aluminum CNC heatsink for the Spintend is nuts.
[2023-02-05T18:20:15] Unknown: Heck yeah Jake! You also helped me with DV6 pro FW before MakerX did it!
[2023-02-05T18:23:32] Face de Pin Suc√©: Welcome Jake üòÅ
[2023-02-05T18:32:06] Jake: Glad I could help! David from MakerX was kind enough to share his source files and we got most of that in the 6.0 firmware release
[2023-02-05T19:39:02] rosheee: sooo
[2023-02-05T19:49:03] rosheee: u checked your motors with multimeter? when u put - inside phase plug and + on motor

[2023-02-05T20:40:54] asyan4ik: It's not the scooter's fault, it's the suspension.
[2023-02-05T20:41:54] asyan4ik: If you want a good scooter, build it yourself
[2023-02-05T20:43:34] asyan4ik: This will change the price, exa piece of shit

[2023-02-05T21:25:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Other way is overpump ,so it falls to parts

[2023-02-05T23:19:37] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: no because this VESC don't have Latch, but if you cut the track before the main regulator and add an wire, you can, but, it's for good √©lectronicien
[2023-02-05T23:21:11] rosheee: then take away the solder there xD

[2023-02-05T23:36:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Basically its cheaper than a spin so they need to compensate before you get over its cheapü§£
[2023-02-05T23:39:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well at some point pretty different to compared to single switch, i mean what happens and how
[2023-02-05T23:40:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But basically Its a simple swich with a fuckload of mosfets üòÅ
[2023-02-05T23:45:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also you can find worse ,same thing from makersbase
[2023-02-05T23:48:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: That shit doesnt power of easy if you dont use there button ,flip does ,i mean after a switch off with not dedicated swich,like a key 15-20 sec you still could press throttle to accelerate
[2023-02-05T23:52:53] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: that depend of the Capacity of the Capacitors, but whatever even very big one, the caps is never capable to can still accelerate after 20sec, even 10, even 5, even 2, if you dont acc√©l√©rate, juste the power of the logic is enough to discharge the Caps in couples of seconds but yeah, it's totally shitty method to turn off an esc
[2023-02-05T23:54:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I dont like it also ,but i dont like lot things but still they existü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇüòÑ With last message ,i ment there is an difference in these also
[2023-02-05T23:57:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also funny thing happened ,one of my mates shared a wheelie video and I found another nice French rap again and i have zero idea what he is talking About, but i like it
[2023-02-06T00:05:09] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Hahaha, you have something with that
[2023-02-06T00:06:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yeah, I laughed up also, it's a nah√¨r song
[2023-02-06T22:29:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Finally found why never overpump it
[2023-02-06T22:29:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: <video_file>
[2023-02-06T22:31:11] rosheee: WORLD CHAMPION?
[2023-02-06T22:44:01] Simone: the quality of the a5 is equivalent to the suspension of decathlon at 12‚Ç¨ üòÇ
[2023-02-06T22:47:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yes
[2023-02-06T22:47:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Not true
[2023-02-06T22:47:39] Mirono escooters: Isn't this more BCS it pulled itself apart?
[2023-02-06T22:47:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: More like if you dont understand dont touch
[2023-02-06T22:47:52] Mirono escooters: When he flew or Smth, it ripped it out
[2023-02-06T22:48:02] Mirono escooters: Exa is good enough, for price
[2023-02-06T22:48:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Over pumped jump
[2023-02-06T22:48:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: After it went over it limits coz of pressure,like popping champagne
[2023-02-06T22:53:50] Simone: loss of pressure over time, leakage of pressure from the negative chamber to the positive ... if you say so that they are of good quality ...
[2023-02-06T22:54:16] Simone: try a fox or rockshox and see how the music changes
[2023-02-06T22:58:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Zero times i had a problem,and mounted several for Customers,but i dont mount them dry Kinda all do that, than you have issues , after you try one for first Should be clear what problem it has basically. Near this whole company who makes it Should be familar woth this üòÖ Also purpose,this is not for big scooter ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ In a way you are also right
[2023-02-06T22:59:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Mate , can i dm you? Would say it's a bit of a business, Unsure what you will say ,but not vesc related
[2023-02-06T23:52:30] Unknown: How do I mute notifications
[2023-02-06T23:52:39] Unknown: And remove pinned messages
[2023-02-06T23:54:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Mainly right corner on top 3 dots
[2023-02-06T23:54:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Mute for *time
[2023-02-06T23:54:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also hide pinned
[2023-02-06T23:54:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Both there
[2023-02-07T00:20:05] Mirko Boni: Good evening everyone.. Today I installed the new vesc spintend single..
[2023-02-07T00:20:26] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_7667@07-02-2023_00-20-26.jpg>
[2023-02-07T00:20:39] Mirko Boni: So I tried the scooter at home..
[2023-02-07T00:20:42] Mirko Boni: <video_file>
[2023-02-07T00:21:23] Mirko Boni: The vsett engine blew.. Game over.. The end.. Finish..
[2023-02-07T00:21:41] Mirono escooters: How??
[2023-02-07T00:21:51] Mirono escooters: Windings looked ok. Halls rip? Replace
[2023-02-07T00:22:58] Mirko Boni: Mirono, unfortunately this noise also makes it at 50 km/h
[2023-02-07T00:52:02] Simone: is this noise coming from both engines?
[2023-02-07T00:52:28] Mirko Boni: It's a single engine
[2023-02-07T00:53:32] Simone: have you already tried to exclude the functioning with hall?
[2023-02-07T01:05:34] Mirono escooters: Mine
[2023-02-07T01:05:45] Mirono escooters: I'd still give it a go
[2023-02-07T01:11:44] Simone: in the video it does not seem to me at 50kmh üòÖ
[2023-02-07T01:13:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well bY Measure nothing bad can happen
[2023-02-07T01:15:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also thinking about is more like a coil problem like he already had ?
[2023-02-07T01:15:15] Simone: excluding the halls and setting it up costs nothing.
[2023-02-07T01:15:31] Simone: it's just a test right?
[2023-02-07T01:15:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yeah i agree
[2023-02-07T01:15:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: More than that he issues after issues,days now
[2023-02-07T01:16:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Doenst need to open
[2023-02-07T01:17:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Just get multimeter and turn to 20 v Turn whole shit on Stick black in sensor wire black as its plugged in vesc
[2023-02-07T01:17:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Red to yellow
[2023-02-07T01:17:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Spin by hand Read voltgate
[2023-02-07T01:18:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Blue and green also
[2023-02-07T01:18:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: All should be same
[2023-02-07T01:18:32] Simone: Use sensorless mode...
[2023-02-07T01:19:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yeah but voltgate can be lower and still work
[2023-02-07T01:19:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also after soldering are we sure nothing left inside?
[2023-02-07T01:20:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If he would be close would say come over but way too far
[2023-02-07T01:20:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I am just brainstorming
[2023-02-07T01:24:01] Simone: Rip vesc üòÇ
[2023-02-07T01:25:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But things is why ,i mean Unsure that even without loads focer die from settings
[2023-02-07T01:26:29] Simone: I meant focer üòÇ
[2023-02-07T01:26:45] Mirko Boni: Yess.. The noise remains
[2023-02-07T01:27:35] Mirko Boni: Simone sorry, if you haven't seen it, it doesn't mean it isn't like that.. I don't tell lies.....
[2023-02-07T01:28:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well a mosfet short is usually fixable if only that
[2023-02-07T01:29:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Once i had similar, there noises was even worse,but that was coil damaged old motor ,i was afraid It had noise like whole will blow up under diagüôà
[2023-02-07T01:30:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I would try that with motor too ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-02-07T01:31:09] Mirko Boni: Simone, te lo scrivo in italiano.. Ah ah ah ah ah ah, le prove che mi chiedete io le ho gi√† fatte...
[2023-02-07T01:31:19] Simone: I have not followed the whole story ... the resolution to understand the problem is only by trial and error. I'd start with trying another engine to rule it out.
[2023-02-07T01:32:14] Mirko Boni: I just installed the new vesc and it still continues to have this defect. The engine is burnt out
[2023-02-07T01:32:43] Simone: Immagino...vai per esclusione dei componenti. Buttaci su un qualsiasi altro motore funzionante e verifica se il rumore scompare.
[2023-02-07T01:33:13] Mirko Boni: Ho il motore di Paolo wu da 800w prover√≤ quello
[2023-02-07T01:33:46] Mirko Boni: Exactly
[2023-02-07T01:35:06] Simone: you already have the answer then üòâ
[2023-02-07T01:36:29] Mirko Boni: Simone, tu sei l'amico di vic?
[2023-02-07T01:37:10] Simone: S√¨
[2023-02-07T01:37:13] Mirko Boni: As soon as I disassemble the engine I open it
[2023-02-07T01:37:28] Mirko Boni: Ahhh quel ragazzo che sgomma anche a 100 km/h üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-02-07T01:37:46] Simone: Esatto üòÇ
[2023-02-07T01:38:02] Mirko Boni: Io esco con Vic.. Siamo amici, abitiamo a Cagliari
[2023-02-07T01:38:08] Mirko Boni: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-02-07T01:38:41] Simone: before I resumed the welding of the phases... was the noise present?
[2023-02-07T01:39:07] Mirko Boni: No.. It was making another noise
[2023-02-07T01:39:50] Mirko Boni: I welded the phases and this noise didn't make it.. Yesterday while I was testing the scooter it started making this noise..
[2023-02-07T01:40:18] Mirko Boni: @Simone_19 I send you yesterday's video when everything worked
[2023-02-07T01:41:00] Simone: it's not a scooter...it's an orchestra üòÇ
[2023-02-07T01:41:14] Mirko Boni: <video_file>
[2023-02-07T01:41:27] Mirko Boni: üòîüòîüòîüòî
[2023-02-07T01:41:45] Mirko Boni: After I made this video this happened
[2023-02-07T01:42:12] Mirko Boni: <video_file>
[2023-02-07T01:42:25] Mirko Boni: After a few miles this happened
[2023-02-07T01:42:56] Mirko Boni: <video_file>
[2023-02-07T01:43:56] Mirko Boni: My engine is the best
[2023-02-07T01:44:10] Simone: can't it be a filament from the winding that has rubbed on the motor drl cover and is therefore exposed?
[2023-02-07T01:44:52] Mirko Boni: Ho fatto il test delle fasi con il coperchio.. Non c'√® cortocircuito
[2023-02-07T01:45:15] Mirko Boni: I did the phase test with the lid.. There is no short circuit
[2023-02-07T01:46:03] Mirko Boni: Come on, I'll buy it new
[2023-02-07T01:47:43] Mirko Boni: If we succeed with James we buy a 60H
[2023-02-07T01:47:44] Simone: I'm selling you my 65mm üòÇ
[2023-02-07T01:47:59] Mirko Boni: Ma nel G30 ci sta?
[2023-02-07T01:48:18] Mirko Boni: Exactly
[2023-02-07T01:48:38] Mirko Boni: 125mm is the maximum
[2023-02-07T01:48:54] Mirko Boni: I can mount an 11 inch but with 125 width
[2023-02-07T01:48:59] Simone: √à 11...davanti col monorim puoi montare la qualsiasi...dietro devi rifare i bracci
[2023-02-07T01:49:14] Mirko Boni: Ho sospensioni ars

[2023-02-07T01:52:59] Simone: Dietro non puoi...
[2023-02-07T01:54:19] Mirko Boni: Dai, se riesco a prendere il 60H √® ottimo.. Dovrebbe scaldare meno
[2023-02-07T01:54:31] Simone: do they make 60mm with 120mm drop out?
[2023-02-07T01:55:50] Mirko Boni: Yes it exists
[2023-02-07T01:56:25] Simone: so at most... it will be fun with the disc support surface

[2023-02-07T01:56:57] Mirko Boni: It doesn't worry me.. Because I have space
[2023-02-07T01:57:06] Mirko Boni: Non ne ho idea sinceramente..
[2023-02-07T01:57:45] Mirko Boni: @Simone_19 Ti mando una foto dello spazio che ho.. Ho messo persino le rondelle per l'adattatore
[2023-02-07T01:58:58] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_7670@07-02-2023_01-58-58.jpg>
[2023-02-07T02:06:50] Simone: having the suspension arms outside the frame you have increased the wheelbase...so it is more plausible
[2023-02-07T02:07:09] Unknown: I can mute sounds but not stop the toast notifications
[2023-02-07T02:12:17] Mirko Boni: Ok ok.. Cmq complimenti per la tua bestia..
[2023-02-07T02:12:58] Simone: @mirkus74
[2023-02-07T02:13:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: In this size i would try atleast for my self

[2023-02-07T02:25:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You will open the engine anyway?
[2023-02-07T02:25:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Just curios
[2023-02-07T02:26:09] Simone: Custom box + front fusion from vsett11 + rear fusion from zero11x
[2023-02-07T02:26:43] Simone: <photos/photo_7672@07-02-2023_02-26-43.jpg>
[2023-02-07T02:27:55] Simone: Yes
[2023-02-07T02:28:19] Simone: I did 3 "evolution"
[2023-02-07T02:28:35] Mirko Boni: When the new engine arrives, I take this one apart
[2023-02-07T02:28:37] Simone: Foto da Simone
[2023-02-07T02:29:03] Simone: The first evolution with blade10 frame
[2023-02-07T02:30:06] Simone: I cut the lateral panel, add some alluminium in the original fusion and create new box
[2023-02-07T02:30:34] Simone: Foto da Simone
[2023-02-07T02:31:44] Simone: Second evolution with front suspension of vsett11, "blade frame" and zero11x swingarm

[2023-02-07T02:32:19] Face de Pin Suc√©: Oh no, Kelly üò≠
[2023-02-07T02:32:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Let me know what you see even in private
[2023-02-07T02:33:06] Simone: and the latest evolution is what I'm building
[2023-02-07T02:33:50] Mirko Boni: Yess.. I do it very gladly..
[2023-02-07T02:34:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Making it Always better probably
[2023-02-07T02:34:36] Simone: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ When there's a stable, equally powerful blister that doesn't burn just by looking at it, I'll be ready to abandon Kelly üòú
[2023-02-07T02:35:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: Well, I've seen Kelly burnt just by looking them üò≠üòÇüòÇ
[2023-02-07T02:35:46] Face de Pin Suc√©: There are now stable and more powerful VESC than Kelly 7230 ‚ò∫Ô∏è
[2023-02-07T02:36:28] Face de Pin Suc√©: I've ran so many Kelly, I'm sick of it
[2023-02-07T02:37:46] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes possible, but settings are do damn crazy
[2023-02-07T02:41:06] Simone: The first evolution was all more complicated...passage from 10 inches to 11 inches, frame cut and rewelded. The second evolution was born because the frame with type c fork sucked ... at strong accelerations and as soon as I approached 100kmh the wooble began ... therefore assembly of a double stem fork with remaking of the bearing housing and pin. The third evolution was born instead because the 22s battery didn't fit üòÇ
[2023-02-07T02:41:53] Simone: a friend burned two tronics 250 while walking up two steps by hand
[2023-02-07T02:41:59] Simone: <animation>
[2023-02-07T02:42:14] Unknown: Can you explain that in layman's terms please?

[2023-02-07T02:46:18] Unknown: Naah WhatsApp and discord are by far the most feature-comolete followed closely by signal. AFAIK this app is just for political prisoners to evade spies or something like that idk.

[2023-02-07T02:50:14] Simone: At the moment I'm limited by the engines... with 75mm I'd get a lot more A's out
[2023-02-07T02:50:26] Unknown: So that must make this app completely unusable.

[2023-02-07T03:00:34] Face de Pin Suc√©: We make tests on calibrated power supply when we work on developping VESC
[2023-02-07T03:01:00] Face de Pin Suc√©: Saying that """VESC""" gives fake datas is really showing knowing anything
[2023-02-07T03:01:28] Face de Pin Suc√©: Well actually, I've seen this problem only on spintend
[2023-02-07T03:01:28] Simone: I liked it more aesthetically on the contrary

[2023-02-07T07:23:46] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 2 fets in parallel (12 fet system) makes 760A cont.drain current by datasheet. So 400A phase can be ok if scheme is strong
[2023-02-07T09:25:01] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: They are like ncep85t14
[2023-02-07T09:27:36] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2023-02-07T09:28:40] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: If 2 in parallel 400A phase will be ok
[2023-02-07T09:28:59] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Already tested in 75100 and 400a. It can maintain but not long
[2023-02-07T09:29:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: And these are only 6
[2023-02-07T09:29:38] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Its ok for 12 fets

[2023-02-07T12:22:24] Mirko Boni: It was not easy to make it because it is designed for the front rim of the G30..
[2023-02-07T12:22:37] Mirko Boni: If you want I can ask

[2023-02-07T12:23:49] Mirko Boni: Unfortunately my monorim also has play.. This ARS is excellent
[2023-02-07T12:24:36] Santiago: Yeah I see they reinforced the sides to prevent it from having play due to vibration
[2023-02-07T12:25:02] Mirko Boni: This is not the center tie like the monorim
[2023-02-07T12:25:38] Santiago: I mean this piece here

[2023-02-07T16:23:50] Mirko Boni: I bought it in November
[2023-02-07T16:24:29] S1m 0n: Within the EU, the seller must prove that the defects were not previously present, within 6 months
[2023-02-07T16:24:50] Mirko Boni: But they don't answer me
[2023-02-07T16:25:05] sombre_enfant: I start to geniully trippin about mine.. I need to open them now
[2023-02-07T16:25:53] S1m 0n: you can send a letter where the recipient has to sign. that is legally binding
[2023-02-07T16:26:04] Gordan Gizdic: So what, conclusion is that vsett motors can take 90batt and 190phase.
[2023-02-07T16:26:31] S1m 0n: You can also raise a dispute with PayPal if you can prove that the seller is not responding
[2023-02-07T16:26:45] sombre_enfant: U can clearly ask for it u have pictures video and everything... Just try to maybe cut the scooter... Its not seller who refund but the global plug
[2023-02-07T16:27:10] Gordan Gizdic: Motor threw up. Dont you get it?
[2023-02-07T16:27:14] Mirko Boni: I paid by credit card because they no longer have PayPal
[2023-02-07T16:27:44] Mirko Boni: What does it mean he vomited?
[2023-02-07T16:28:00] Gordan Gizdic: Could be.

[2023-02-07T16:28:23] Gordan Gizdic: Has anyone checked wires going through shaft?

[2023-02-07T16:30:04] Mirko Boni: Let's do this, I don't mount it anymore.. I throw it from a high mountain until the engine becomes square...
[2023-02-07T16:31:06] Gordan Gizdic: No, you open dispute, than xou get your money back, that you can rape it if you wish. But first get money back
[2023-02-07T16:31:36] Mirko Boni: But I paid by credit card
[2023-02-07T16:31:36] Gordan Gizdic: So request a new motor, if they dont respond, than go to bank and ask for a chargeback.
[2023-02-07T16:32:01] Mirko Boni: Is it possible to get a credit back on my credit card?
[2023-02-07T16:32:06] Gordan Gizdic: Yes
[2023-02-07T16:32:08] Gordan Gizdic: Easily.
[2023-02-07T16:32:17] Gordan Gizdic: Thats called chargeback
[2023-02-07T16:32:22] Mirko Boni: Even if in November?
[2023-02-07T16:32:30] Gordan Gizdic: Doesnt matter.
[2023-02-07T16:32:44] Gordan Gizdic: My wife does that and she won cases that were 4 years old.
[2023-02-07T16:32:53] Mirko Boni: Ok ok.. Now I write to them and threaten them
[2023-02-07T16:33:04] Mirko Boni: Woow
[2023-02-07T16:34:05] Gordan Gizdic: Shes a Visa and Mastercard chargeback specialist and does this every single day.
[2023-02-07T16:34:15] Gordan Gizdic: So if she said you can, than do et.
[2023-02-07T16:35:30] Gordan Gizdic: Write to seller, threaten with chargeback process and it they dont comply, go to bank and ask for chargeback process. You will need proof that the motor was sold as new online, proof you motor isnt old.
[2023-02-07T16:35:42] Gordan Gizdic: And than wait a bit untill the process is finished.
[2023-02-07T16:36:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: You can‚Äôt get back after the money arrived to beneficiary, the only thing bank can do, is (if you‚Äôve insurance in your contract) that bank refund you.
[2023-02-07T16:36:15] Gordan Gizdic: Proof your motor isnt new.
[2023-02-07T16:36:34] Gordan Gizdic: Yes you can.

[2023-02-08T00:25:19] S1m 0n: I had a fpv drone years ago..They are fast and maneuverable, but the video depends on the GoPro you have to stick on the drone. Also the radio doesn't reach as blatantly far now. DJI's have a very good image and the radio is inherently far. We in the EU only have EC mode, but with simple tricks you can enable US FCC mode, which gives you 30-50% more range. By changing the tilt angle, you can make the drone fly faster. at were from about 50kmh to about 75kmh. Otherwise, the drones are also very friendly in terms of battarie modded..both in series, as well as for capacity, but there you come by the weight of course quickly to its limits. But for n all-round carefree package, they are excellent @jamessoderstrom

[2023-02-08T01:46:48] Mirko Boni: No no.. It's not ground weld.. It's the stator ground against the poles

[2023-02-08T01:50:13] Mirko Boni: I believe it is the stator hitting the loose magnets
[2023-02-08T01:50:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Not Really if kinda new ,but also like Paolo said ,if they keep it shitty place can happen,also if you keep it in a cold place where is moisture all time

[2023-02-09T13:04:41] Santiago: It's kinda small but fitting 2 of them in there gotta be a nightmare
[2023-02-09T13:04:49] rosheee: No
[2023-02-09T13:05:00] rosheee: With 16S nope
[2023-02-09T13:05:07] rosheee: 20S kind of
[2023-02-09T13:05:36] Santiago: U have a pic of the inside??

[2023-02-09T13:11:49] Jan: Its tight with 2x controllers + 20s6p 21700 but it works
[2023-02-09T13:15:51] Santiago: Yeah I've been sticking to 21700 too
[2023-02-09T13:16:35] Santiago: I just wonder how u fit 2 boards in there with that long ass battery
[2023-02-09T13:17:28] Santiago: I own a pro 2 and gonna look for a g30 for more space
[2023-02-09T13:20:59] rosheee: ;-)

[2023-02-09T17:34:38] Mirono escooters: It's a factor
[2023-02-09T17:34:48] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2023-02-09T17:34:54] Mirono escooters: I liked it, abit
[2023-02-09T17:47:27] Jan: Can somebody pin this ?
[2023-02-09T17:47:50] rosheee: only admins
[2023-02-09T19:40:21] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Done
[2023-02-09T19:43:23] Jan: ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2023-02-09T20:27:49] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: This is russian scooter called RTV (Custom local manufacturer) with "fixed" long arms. Before it was as like dualtrons, vsetts etc or similar - trail is around at zero point. So wobble is usual thing on that type of geometry. Can you explain that? I literally see negative trail. Not positive. The wheel and geometry will try to turn the wheel like a supermarket cart here
[2023-02-09T20:28:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Also look what numo slack did with thunder 2s
[2023-02-09T20:28:16] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Longer and lower swingarms aswell
[2023-02-09T20:28:22] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: How it fcking works
[2023-02-09T20:32:08] Mirono escooters: Y?
[2023-02-09T21:40:20] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, a little bit, but i think its not cause geometry and swing arms, but cause heavily tightened steering bearings lol
[2023-02-09T21:40:31] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: it takes too much effort to turn
[2023-02-09T21:42:31] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: but that has nothing to do with the big positive trail. you see it is negative
[2023-02-10T01:16:29] rosheee: tested 16S and 20S with fagot settings 0-50 km/h and my fat ass on it 94kg 16S: 3,7sec 0-50km/h ( 275.31A phase peak / 166.58A battery peak / 8897W peak( 20S: 3.2sec 0-50km/h (455A phase peak / 258A battery peak / 18758W peak)
[2023-02-10T01:18:02] rosheee: true slow due spinning tire but remember 10" 10x3
[2023-02-10T01:18:08] rosheee: and fat ass
[2023-02-10T01:22:48] rosheee: without
[2023-02-10T01:22:55] rosheee: and high tire pressure
[2023-02-10T01:23:05] rosheee: and 9 degrees battery temp ^^'
[2023-02-10T01:23:12] rosheee: and 80% battery cap.
[2023-02-10T08:18:33] Gordan Gizdic: <photos/photo_7707@10-02-2023_08-18-33.jpg>
[2023-02-10T08:19:05] Gordan Gizdic: Thats about the same as im getting on my 16S setup and also fat ass.
[2023-02-10T08:19:43] Gordan Gizdic: This is with no TC and cold.
[2023-02-10T08:19:54] Gordan Gizdic: With TC, its 0.8s slower
[2023-02-10T08:20:02] Gordan Gizdic: <photos/photo_7708@10-02-2023_08-20-02.jpg>
[2023-02-10T09:17:46] Jan: Technically makes no sense unless the traction control doesnt work properly
[2023-02-10T09:20:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: Phone gps can‚Äôt measure correctly acceleration
[2023-02-10T09:20:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: Dragy is made for something
[2023-02-10T09:21:25] Gordan Gizdic: Can measure the difference. And yeah, TC actually doesnt give full power up untill 35kmh. Than it pulls hard.
[2023-02-10T09:25:46] Gordan Gizdic: https://youtu.be/2sTBVTY-gO0?t=34
[2023-02-10T09:26:18] Gordan Gizdic: Vesc speed, GoPro speed and app time. All come down to 0.1s and the best i did on this surface is 3.1s to 50kmh.
[2023-02-10T09:54:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: exactly
[2023-02-10T13:17:17] Jan: When i had TC on, had less accel (felt like rear wheel doesnt get enough juice) and in the end the controllers were a lot warmer for no reason
[2023-02-10T13:18:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: have you done some measurements ?
[2023-02-10T13:20:28] Face de Pin Suc√©: I mean, measurements of actual zero start to a certain speed
[2023-02-10T13:20:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: Because, we all have the feeling that torque is not great with TC
[2023-02-10T13:21:18] Face de Pin Suc√©: but for now, I eat every escooter I race against on acceleration
[2023-02-10T13:21:33] Face de Pin Suc√©: Still only 20S6P battery
[2023-02-10T13:24:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: it seems, still need to take time, dragy and measure it x)
[2023-02-10T13:38:39] Jan: No, i cannot conclude anything yet. Only measurement i did was controller temp and its a lot more
[2023-02-10T13:43:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: weather allows but compact is fully teared down now, she's getting a better look for the "Salon du 2 roues" in France, a fair for motorcycles and those things of 2 wheels that have motors x)
[2023-02-10T13:46:32] Face de Pin Suc√©: Well, she i, but unfinished for testing purposes
[2023-02-10T13:46:50] Face de Pin Suc√©: now she will be finished for show purposes
[2023-02-10T13:46:56] Face de Pin Suc√©: then photos, videos, ...
[2023-02-10T13:47:04] Face de Pin Suc√©: then competition maybe :p
[2023-02-10T13:55:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: Haha I will, fair is in 13 days, so she'll be ready soon
[2023-02-10T16:15:49] Gordan Gizdic: I logged more than a few runs. Back motor is full powah, no issued there but the front is limited a LOT, like to half power. Even if i transfer the weight to front end and stop slipping, its still limiting. When i turn off TC and go all front with weight, i had a 2.8s runs done in cold weather. Difference comes down to 0.8s between TC and no TC. Also, tried fw to compensate for loss of accel after 60kmh. That produced worse results in all cases as soon as i applied Field Weakening.
[2023-02-10T16:17:16] Gordan Gizdic: For best possible accel, wheel needs to slip at the right percentage, our tests from 402SR on cars showed that around 8 percent is ideal for maksimum accel.
[2023-02-10T16:18:13] Gordan Gizdic: And when i reproduce this on a scoot, i come down to about 2.8s for 0-50kmh time. Tuovt tires, 3 degrees Celsius. So cold weather and not much grip.
[2023-02-10T16:20:46] Gordan Gizdic: <photos/photo_7709@10-02-2023_16-20-46.jpg>
[2023-02-10T16:21:30] Gordan Gizdic: App is not meant to be 100percent accurate in results. But can show under same conditions if im gaining or loosing. Thats what i use it for.
[2023-02-10T16:22:33] Gordan Gizdic: I have multiple 2.8s runs, it all depends if the front wheel hooks up. If it doesnt, im closer to 5s, if it does, low 3s.
[2023-02-10T16:23:50] Gordan Gizdic: Settings were 70batt amps and 150/155 phase amps.
[2023-02-10T16:28:05] Gordan Gizdic: Per esc.
[2023-02-10T20:52:30] S1m 0n: My engine after 13month/around 11-12k km, 24/7 stands outside .. is good so far

[2023-02-10T20:57:15] Mirko Boni: My engine definitely got submerged in water
[2023-02-11T16:00:43] Happy Giraffe: Hehe working
[2023-02-11T16:01:20] Face de Pin Suc√©: What is it ?
[2023-02-11T16:05:04] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_7714@11-02-2023_16-05-04.jpg>
[2023-02-11T16:05:13] Happy Giraffe: Ebike motor testing haha
[2023-02-11T16:05:36] Happy Giraffe: Gonna go for test ride with throttle, torque sensor is tomorrows plan
[2023-02-11T16:56:07] rosheee: Torque sensor?
[2023-02-11T17:13:52] Happy Giraffe: I test that tomorrow, today simple throttle test
[2023-02-11T17:26:45] Luis Magalhaes: üëå
[2023-02-11T19:28:06] rosheee: Noiiiice
[2023-02-11T20:48:21] Happy Giraffe: Motor kicked ass with 80A phaseüòÇ
[2023-02-11T20:48:44] Happy Giraffe: Who has 6.0 firmware for old spintend single?üò≥
[2023-02-11T20:48:51] rosheee: sec0nd
[2023-02-11T20:48:52] rosheee: here
[2023-02-11T20:49:03] Mirono escooters: Pft try 250a
[2023-02-11T20:49:09] rosheee: <files/ubox_single_75_no_limits.bin>
[2023-02-11T20:49:16] Happy Giraffe: The start is still bit brrrt with 5.3
[2023-02-11T20:49:24] rosheee: change settings
[2023-02-11T20:49:27] Happy Giraffe: Baguette
[2023-02-11T20:49:27] rosheee: then better starteria
[2023-02-11T20:49:43] rosheee: hoold on ma luf
[2023-02-11T20:49:57] Happy Giraffe: But I try to find how as it has to do with the sensored start
[2023-02-11T20:50:03] Mirono escooters: Problably not fw issue
[2023-02-11T20:50:08] rosheee: no but
[2023-02-11T20:50:11] rosheee: change this
[2023-02-11T20:50:34] rosheee: <photos/photo_7715@11-02-2023_20-50-34.jpg>
[2023-02-11T20:50:38] Happy Giraffe: It was same with scooter start
[2023-02-11T20:50:38] rosheee: and put values @hall sensor lower
[2023-02-11T20:50:53] rosheee: sensorless like 400erpm and hall interpol. to 300-400
[2023-02-11T20:51:02] Mirono escooters: 400?
[2023-02-11T20:51:03] Mirono escooters: Jeez
[2023-02-11T20:51:04] rosheee: yes
[2023-02-11T20:51:06] rosheee: XD whazt
[2023-02-11T20:51:11] Happy Giraffe: Hmm I also got 5:1 gearing haha
[2023-02-11T20:51:11] rosheee: why jeez
[2023-02-11T20:51:19] rosheee: also take off this shizzl
[2023-02-11T20:51:23] rosheee: @ PID
[2023-02-11T20:51:24] Happy Giraffe: So it has solid speed on rotor
[2023-02-11T20:51:41] rosheee: <photos/photo_7716@11-02-2023_20-51-41.jpg>
[2023-02-11T20:51:58] Mirono escooters: Low
[2023-02-11T20:53:46] Happy Giraffe: So I should use same settings as in the pic?
[2023-02-11T20:54:02] rosheee: yes
[2023-02-11T20:54:04] rosheee: try it
[2023-02-11T20:54:12] rosheee: if fail then change back
[2023-02-11T20:54:44] rosheee: ah
[2023-02-11T20:54:55] rosheee: and calibrate the position offset for PID
[2023-02-11T20:55:09] rosheee: go realtime data -> rotor position -> PID POS
[2023-02-11T20:55:14] rosheee: then u see how many degrees
[2023-02-11T20:55:34] Happy Giraffe: Hmm I gotta tweak one at a time
[2023-02-11T20:55:41] rosheee: then go back to PID controllers and
[2023-02-11T20:55:48] rosheee: change le throttle to natural ^^
[2023-02-11T20:56:44] rosheee: if FOC_CC_DECOUPLING_BEMF not suc√© choose
[2023-02-11T20:56:54] rosheee: <photos/photo_7718@11-02-2023_20-56-54.jpg>
[2023-02-11T20:57:36] rosheee: and also faut stop time to 50ms
[2023-02-11T20:58:04] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, I try slowly one at a time
[2023-02-11T20:58:21] Happy Giraffe: First just tuning halls and foc with different currents first
[2023-02-11T20:58:39] rosheee: dis stock settings
[2023-02-11T20:59:01] rosheee: for how pimp hall?
[2023-02-11T23:22:47] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_7719@11-02-2023_23-22-47.jpg>
[2023-02-11T23:23:00] Happy Giraffe: Prototype look, will be cleaner when done
[2023-02-11T23:24:08] Happy Giraffe: Helmet and glass combo = suce
[2023-02-12T08:04:18] Luis Magalhaes: Looks clean üëçüòÅ
[2023-02-12T12:54:07] Happy Giraffe: Thanks its only a first ride prototype, gonna need to print a box for vesc etc get rid of front shifter
[2023-02-12T13:41:27] Luis Magalhaes: Nice mate, have to make one with my bike someday too
[2023-02-12T13:42:05] Mirono escooters: Yess
[2023-02-12T13:42:12] Mirono escooters: Bike gang
[2023-02-12T14:01:03] Happy Giraffe: On bike its so smooth feeling
[2023-02-12T14:01:23] Happy Giraffe: Installing torque sensor today
[2023-02-12T14:02:27] Mirono escooters: Ieuw, want full powa
[2023-02-12T14:46:36] Happy Giraffe: Motor heats upüòÇ
[2023-02-12T14:46:45] Happy Giraffe: Temp sensor really useful
[2023-02-12T16:14:55] Mirono escooters: Mine not, ezpz 6kw
[2023-02-12T16:14:58] Mirono escooters: It isn't even warm
[2023-02-12T18:37:22] Mirono escooters: Any reason to not coat inside of motor w water repelling enamel?
[2023-02-12T18:37:24] Mirono escooters: Heat ig?
[2023-02-12T19:40:44] Happy Giraffe: Do you have a sensor inside?üåö
[2023-02-12T19:41:28] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-02-12T19:43:10] Happy Giraffe: Geared motors transfer heat worse than DD, my motor 70¬∞c inside but outside cover really coolüòÖ
[2023-02-12T19:43:50] Mirono escooters: Gearedü•≤
[2023-02-12T19:44:02] Happy Giraffe: But damn the efficiency and torque
[2023-02-12T19:44:03] Mirono escooters: Mine 6kw noo problemo ezpzzz
[2023-02-12T19:44:11] Mirono escooters: Pft 250a phase does same thing
[2023-02-12T19:44:17] Happy Giraffe: My 80AüòÅ
[2023-02-12T19:44:46] Mirono escooters: Boring
[2023-02-12T19:46:04] Happy Giraffe: But imagine big ass geared motor thats 5kwüòÅ
[2023-02-12T19:46:58] Happy Giraffe: I also found out the problem to the vibrating start, the 5.3fw FOC tune in the setting is unusable
[2023-02-12T19:47:16] Happy Giraffe: You gotta use the motor wizard on the phone app and then its smooth af
[2023-02-12T19:49:38] Mirono escooters: Have fun stripping gears
[2023-02-12T19:49:53] Mirono escooters: There's no space for the humungus gears u need for such power Geared only makes sense for low power
[2023-02-12T19:50:03] Mirono escooters: Always use that
[2023-02-12T19:50:30] Mirono escooters: Happy what's your topspeed?
[2023-02-12T19:51:38] Happy Giraffe: Ofc it would have big steel gears etc
[2023-02-12T19:52:07] Mirono escooters: Yeah but no space inside such a motor. No sense making it geared. DD wins
[2023-02-12T19:52:16] Mirono escooters: For small motors I agree. I got a geared on here too
[2023-02-12T19:52:18] Happy Giraffe: Havent tried for real yet and the logs I created cant be opened by my vesc tool 3.1 or 6.0
[2023-02-12T19:52:19] Mirono escooters: Cooling would be bad too
[2023-02-12T19:52:23] Mirono escooters: :((((
[2023-02-12T19:52:39] Happy Giraffe: I think about 45kmh
[2023-02-12T19:52:50] Mirono escooters: And 0-45?
[2023-02-12T19:53:43] Happy Giraffe: Havent measured, all snowy and icy here. It isnt an acceleration beast as it only has 2000wüòÇ
[2023-02-12T19:54:14] Happy Giraffe: But it pulls like a truck from 0-20üåö
[2023-02-12T19:55:01] Mirono escooters: Poor thing
[2023-02-12T19:55:16] Mirono escooters: Lets compare ;)
[2023-02-12T19:55:22] Mirono escooters: Go brr
[2023-02-12T19:55:29] Mirono escooters: I wait for camera mount so I cAn record
[2023-02-12T19:55:35] Happy Giraffe: Fun is to pedal with it, feels like flying

[2023-02-13T01:01:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: No, smaller magnet, faster motor goes

[2023-02-13T01:01:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: Larger magnet is, more torque you have but is slower
[2023-02-13T01:02:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Smaller I mean in his width
[2023-02-13T01:03:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: Kelly 7212 is with 12 x 5.5mR fet, 2.25 total , such is double resistance of ubox fet üòÖüòÖ

[2023-02-13T09:11:29] Mirono escooters: Correct
[2023-02-13T09:57:24] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes but very low torque, Kelly 7212 only 120A phase, have tested on 50H motors, running around 115Kmh with 50E battery, but damn slow torque x)
[2023-02-13T09:57:36] Mirono escooters: 120, boring
[2023-02-13T09:57:40] Mirono escooters: Xiaomi Esc does that xD
[2023-02-13T09:58:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: 7230 ==> 30 fet
[2023-02-13T09:59:41] Face de Pin Suc√©: The only interesting thing with 7212 is 120A phase/120A battery, with proper coolinh you can keep up to 120A battery, then in dual with 20S, you can reach 16KW, high power after 60Kmh, but before, slow as fuck
[2023-02-13T10:05:09] Mirono escooters: Proper cooling, define?
[2023-02-13T10:05:15] Mirono escooters: Can't be ez to cool
[2023-02-13T10:06:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: It needs a lot of airflow
[2023-02-13T10:06:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: Best is with angry fans, so even when going slowly, you cool it
[2023-02-13T10:07:51] Mirono escooters: XD

[2023-02-13T11:32:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Some 7218 are 180
[2023-02-13T11:32:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: And some 200

[2023-02-16T16:07:53] S1m 0n: First time I had slime inside. When I then had changed to street tires for the summer, I also changed the hoses. When I switched back to winter on offroad, I have kept them
[2023-02-16T16:09:22] S1m 0n: True
[2023-02-16T16:09:54] S1m 0n: I prefer the offraod in winter because I also drive daily forest and meadow paths

[2023-02-17T12:51:18] francois schempers: hi guys, I'm planning on converting my bicycle, you have some info for good wheel motor ? I'll use Ubox Vesc with it
[2023-02-17T12:58:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Hi In short Onyl enable filtering if your vesc supports that ,if new Firmware is on its probably dissabled coz you dont have that feature,but for this we would need brand
[2023-02-17T12:59:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also did you set
[2023-02-17T12:59:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: <photos/photo_7715@11-02-2023_20-50-34.jpg>
[2023-02-17T13:00:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well ,Happy is building similar stuff
[2023-02-17T13:01:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also maybe @PaoloWu could tell you some infos
[2023-02-17T13:02:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But if you look in nexun.pl nothing bad can happen
[2023-02-17T13:02:22] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: Ubox Single and Do you need all the information? The engine is a blade from PaoloüëÄ, for example
[2023-02-17T13:03:29] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: all other things that I could find here in the group I've put about
[2023-02-17T13:07:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Thats "should" have filtering
[2023-02-17T13:10:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: For new Firmware this most important, other setup messes sensors
[2023-02-17T13:11:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Unsure who messes with filtering,i use lot flips thats not on option in that,
[2023-02-17T13:15:29] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: ok ok just activate and enjoyüòÖ and you still have the other things for me Mtpa and saturation? ü•∫
[2023-02-17T13:45:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: As i said that even its rare that some tries , maybe @jamessoderstrom or @KenLawrence did
[2023-02-17T13:54:12] francois schempers: @jamessoderstrom you're an admin now üí™
[2023-02-17T14:54:52] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Thats nice
[2023-02-17T14:56:05] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Uboxes all have phase filters. They said it even on their blogs
[2023-02-17T14:56:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You need to turn on phase filters only for motor wizard and auto detection for more accurate values
[2023-02-17T14:56:31] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Then turn it off when riding
[2023-02-17T14:59:12] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Spintend said that for less issues while riding
[2023-02-17T14:59:20] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Dunno more info about that why
[2023-02-17T14:59:35] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Its only good for motor wizards
[2023-02-17T15:06:00] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Me too!
[2023-02-17T15:06:21] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Did you try 6.0 with ubox?
[2023-02-17T15:06:56] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Whats with adc calculations?
[2023-02-17T15:07:05] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I mean voltage
[2023-02-17T15:07:22] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 100v
[2023-02-17T15:07:45] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I didnt try yet, but no problem at 36v hah
[2023-02-17T15:08:01] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes

[2023-02-17T15:11:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: Will be first that to test high torque motor, always used high Kv one .
[2023-02-17T15:11:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: High torque like nami
[2023-02-17T15:12:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: Can‚Äôt be faster than 95 at 20s
[2023-02-17T15:12:18] rosheee: 11 inch?
[2023-02-17T15:12:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: Don't put too much amps
[2023-02-17T15:13:16] Face de Pin Suc√©: We unglued magnets with those motors
[2023-02-17T15:15:04] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's not about that
[2023-02-17T15:15:20] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's about heating
[2023-02-17T15:15:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Only 17 parallel, yes
[2023-02-17T15:15:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: High Kv is 33 parallels
[2023-02-17T15:16:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: Nami controller reach about 200A phase
[2023-02-17T15:18:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes but not very very long
[2023-02-17T15:19:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: That depends by your speed
[2023-02-17T15:19:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you‚Äôre in uphill at low speed you could reach that current for much time, and the only protection will be fet overheat
[2023-02-17T15:31:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes and if you keep high phase current, you will unglue magnets
[2023-02-17T15:34:52] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Lol
[2023-02-17T15:37:16] Face de Pin Suc√©: Then no point of pushing high amps x)
[2023-02-17T15:44:33] Santiago: I tried it with 75100 and it blown 2 fets
[2023-02-17T15:45:20] Santiago: Thought it was only for inrunners
[2023-02-17T15:45:37] Santiago: I didn't know xD
[2023-02-17T15:45:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: -1
[2023-02-17T15:46:02] Santiago: They were off
[2023-02-17T15:46:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: Super useful with good vesc
[2023-02-17T15:46:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, our 10 inch blade motor with standard winding , reached 117kmh with 15s thank mtpa and fw
[2023-02-17T15:47:20] Santiago: Only 15süò±üò±
[2023-02-17T15:47:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: Depends by inductance difference
[2023-02-17T15:47:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: Also
[2023-02-17T15:47:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: It affects
[2023-02-17T15:48:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: And even to reach speed you need torque
[2023-02-17T15:48:11] Santiago: As far as I know u also need more torque to push things at higher speeds
[2023-02-17T15:48:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: So it even make sense
[2023-02-17T15:48:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, I think it can even do more if my friend wasn‚Äôt crashed
[2023-02-17T15:49:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Maybe 120 hahaha
[2023-02-17T15:49:08] Santiago: Holy Molly
[2023-02-17T15:49:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not power only
[2023-02-17T15:49:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Be sure not a void board like flipskyüòÅ
[2023-02-17T15:50:37] Santiago: Is blade motor winded in delta?
[2023-02-17T15:52:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: No
[2023-02-17T15:52:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: Never used delta
[2023-02-17T15:53:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: Definitely no sense for my interesting
[2023-02-17T15:53:49] Santiago: Aight
[2023-02-17T15:53:55] Santiago: Where did u buy the motor??
[2023-02-17T15:54:18] Santiago: I'm checking Ali but cannot find it
[2023-02-17T15:58:11] Santiago: Already found it nevermind
[2023-02-17T16:02:24] Santiago: How much phase amps u pushing ??

[2023-02-18T16:32:05] Happy Giraffe: Isnt there a 6.0?
[2023-02-18T16:34:27] Happy Giraffe: I got it from Spintend nvmüòÅ
[2023-02-18T16:40:04] Happy Giraffe: Still 5.3 shouldnt it say 6.0 here? Using newest phone app and 6.0 spintend 75v fw
[2023-02-18T16:41:58] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-02-18T16:46:56] Happy Giraffe: Is there a guide for this as I havent used vesc in a yearüòÇ
[2023-02-18T16:59:00] Happy Giraffe: Oh damn do I have to use an stlink? I thought 6.0 would handle just like the upgrade to 5.3
[2023-02-18T16:59:44] Mirono escooters: No?
[2023-02-18T16:59:55] Mirono escooters: Just use 6.0 app xD
[2023-02-18T17:08:47] Happy Giraffe: I have
[2023-02-18T17:08:58] Happy Giraffe: Newest playstore 6.0.1.2 or something
[2023-02-18T17:09:05] Mirono escooters: Maybe spintend forgot to change 5.3-6
[2023-02-18T17:09:10] Juice: There's a bootloader tab where you can just flash default bootloader
[2023-02-18T17:09:32] Juice: And then you can flash 6.0 firmware right from the vesc tool, dont need to download from spintend
[2023-02-18T17:09:39] Juice: It should stick then
[2023-02-18T17:09:59] Happy Giraffe: I think this, I already updated vesc fw ton of times before and didnt have to do anything extra lol
[2023-02-18T17:09:59] Juice: Although this is on desktop, don't know about app
[2023-02-18T17:10:37] Happy Giraffe: Im not sure that generic 6.0 is compatible as spintend single is old with some 3.3v trickery going on
[2023-02-18T17:11:24] Juice: Ah i dont know about single, with dual they merged their code with vedders repo so for those models you don't have to to to spintend anymore
[2023-02-18T17:11:36] Happy Giraffe: Yeah that would be simplest haha
[2023-02-18T17:12:00] Mirono escooters: Spintend being spintend
[2023-02-18T17:12:04] Juice: But generic 6.0 is not really a thing, if its in the list its normally built for your controller
[2023-02-18T17:12:06] Happy Giraffe: If spintend forgot something, could you send the old single 75v fw 6.0?üòÅ
[2023-02-18T17:13:54] Juice: It's definitely supported
[2023-02-18T17:18:25] Happy Giraffe: I wonder then why it wasnt compatible in the first place then
[2023-02-18T17:20:03] Happy Giraffe: This is from last year
[2023-02-18T17:20:42] Happy Giraffe: But then there's thisüòÇ
[2023-02-18T17:21:31] Juice: Yeah i think some blogs/articles there are old
[2023-02-18T17:22:06] Juice: I updated my v2 100v just fine to 6.0 using firmware shipped with vesc tool
[2023-02-18T17:22:39] Juice: I guess spintend moment
[2023-02-18T17:23:25] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Check page with single ubox
[2023-02-18T17:23:35] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 6.0 already supported by spintend

[2023-02-18T18:08:40] Santiago: Proper setup for soldering with open motor
[2023-02-18T18:08:41] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2023-02-18T18:09:17] Happy Giraffe: Is there a correct ready file to upload with mobile app?
[2023-02-18T18:27:57] Happy Giraffe: I downloaded Vedders file and still shows 5.3
[2023-02-18T18:28:25] Happy Giraffe: I think mobile app cant update to 6.0 or the file has some wanky issue detecting version
[2023-02-18T18:28:53] Happy Giraffe: Im not sure what that means fully
[2023-02-18T18:29:01] Happy Giraffe: I select the 6.0 fw and press upload lolüòÇ

[2023-02-18T23:46:07] Simone: no I said the number of rpm I wanted it to do at X volts
[2023-02-18T23:50:24] Mirko Boni: io avrei paura di finire come nel video famoso della tangenziale..
[2023-02-18T23:50:38] Mirko Boni: Non ti sto giudicando Simone.. √® solo una mia paura
[2023-02-18T23:51:05] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Thats actually how you need to work with chinese factories lol
[2023-02-18T23:51:34] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Just say what speed you need and chinese masters will do it
[2023-02-18T23:51:50] Simone: Qui lo guida il proprietario/mio amico... Io di solito lo faccio fuori da occhi indiscreti
[2023-02-18T23:52:07] Simone: Exactly
[2023-02-18T23:52:28] Mirko Boni: si si so che non sei tu..
[2023-02-18T23:53:33] Simone: Il mio lo provo a monza...spero presto üòÇ
[2023-02-18T23:53:59] Mirko Boni: siete fortunati accidenti.. ah ah ah ah vi invidio tanto

[2023-02-19T02:29:21] rosheee: but for g30 doesn't matter xD
[2023-02-19T02:29:25] rosheee: how is stability @Simone_19?
[2023-02-19T02:29:57] rosheee: motors look like vsett :D
[2023-02-19T02:30:07] rosheee: or he balleria
[2023-02-19T02:30:15] rosheee: angle is nearly |
[2023-02-19T02:30:23] rosheee: tronic v2 less topspeed
[2023-02-19T02:30:25] rosheee: le sad
[2023-02-19T02:30:55] rosheee: and my insta360 also fail when did 133kmh camera failed
[2023-02-19T03:14:09] rosheee: idk
[2023-02-19T03:14:13] rosheee: don't know anymore
[2023-02-19T03:14:19] rosheee: idk why less speed
[2023-02-19T03:20:57] Simone: I have the screen of 123...next time i tell to my friend if capture the 125kmh with insta360
[2023-02-19T03:21:35] rosheee: perfect
[2023-02-19T03:21:40] rosheee: but why no burnout?
[2023-02-19T03:21:43] rosheee: no spinning wheels?
[2023-02-19T03:21:49] Simone: With 20/25¬∞ i think he reach another 2/3kmh
[2023-02-19T03:22:05] rosheee: me done 133 also @ 1-5
[2023-02-19T03:22:20] rosheee: but new esc üòû
[2023-02-19T03:23:36] Simone: with field weakening we are all good üòÇ
[2023-02-19T03:24:00] Simone: No
[2023-02-19T03:28:10] Simone: I know...kelly is old school but it works great despite being cumbersome in accessing the settings
[2023-02-19T03:29:23] Simone: vesc is certainly more evolved but to date no vesc ensures a leap forward
[2023-02-19T03:29:36] Simone: it's all smoke...
[2023-02-19T03:30:04] Simone: in numbers and concretely üòÇ
[2023-02-19T03:30:38] rosheee: with 6.0 FW no
[2023-02-19T03:30:42] rosheee: yes
[2023-02-19T03:30:52] rosheee: ^^'? what
[2023-02-19T03:30:57] rosheee: IDK
[2023-02-19T03:31:01] rosheee: NOT REMEMBER
[2023-02-19T03:31:56] Simone: when there will be a stable vesc that delivers the same amps as the old ECUs such as kelly or yyk, I will be happy to switch to them
[2023-02-19T03:32:50] Simone: My "old" kelly manage 24s and 360A battery
[2023-02-19T03:33:08] Simone: All in 14cm
[2023-02-19T03:33:14] Simone: 7230
[2023-02-19T03:33:55] Simone: without provisions for dissipation
[2023-02-19T03:34:14] Simone: I've seen liquid systems and various crap
[2023-02-19T03:35:08] Simone: I agree but if you want many amperes I know that with vesc you are obliged
[2023-02-19T03:36:50] Simone: so far I've only seen recordings where people brag about lots of phase amps
[2023-02-19T03:38:00] Simone: I don't put how many amps of battery
[2023-02-19T03:38:09] Simone: I put the power in%
[2023-02-19T03:40:38] Simone: <photos/photo_7755@19-02-2023_03-40-38.jpg>
[2023-02-19T03:40:45] Simone: This is 7212
[2023-02-19T03:41:03] Simone: 340A phase max
[2023-02-19T03:42:35] rosheee: yes
[2023-02-19T03:42:37] Simone: Yes
[2023-02-19T03:43:27] Simone: no the value is expressed as a percentage
[2023-02-19T03:44:44] Simone: With 2√ó7212 at 100% i have 185A battery amps
[2023-02-19T03:47:12] Simone: the value fluctuates between 160 and 190A
[2023-02-19T03:47:28] Simone: mostly i have 180A
[2023-02-19T03:48:20] Simone: Only with smart bms
[2023-02-19T03:48:24] Mirko Boni: Sorry Simone, I don't completely agree with you.. In my vesc I set 200A of battery and 400A of phase, but the controller does not exceed 55 degrees.. So I don't see this big problem..
[2023-02-19T03:49:50] Simone: put 200A of controller battery at 24s and let me know if it holds up üòâ
[2023-02-19T03:51:24] Simone: at what price?
[2023-02-19T03:51:50] Mirko Boni: I have a vesc that manages a maximum of 75V, therefore sized for that voltage.. I set 200A of battery and 400A of phase.. Yet it doesn't heat up..
[2023-02-19T03:52:00] Mirko Boni: I have a 16S battery
[2023-02-19T03:55:22] Simone: i'm not a fanboy of kelly and would like to switch to vesc (especially for traction control at the start but to date I don't see any reliable competitors at human cost)
[2023-02-19T03:56:25] Simone: kelly costs 1/3 of shul
[2023-02-19T03:57:14] Simone: the same performance of kelly 7230s are more than enough...it's already suicide like that üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-02-19T03:57:38] Simone: 260‚Ç¨ for unit
[2023-02-19T03:58:13] Mirko Boni: Dual motor, 2 controller?
[2023-02-19T03:58:26] Simone: 260√ó2
[2023-02-19T03:58:35] Mirko Boni: Ok ok
[2023-02-19T04:00:41] Simone: I don't know how they measure this value...I register higher values
[2023-02-19T04:01:38] Simone: you are right about this
[2023-02-19T04:02:25] Simone: but for example the 7212 are given for 50A continuous ... I have never seen below 80A
[2023-02-19T04:05:28] Simone: <photos/photo_7756@19-02-2023_04-05-28.jpg>
[2023-02-19T04:06:00] Simone: maybe now the price has gone up ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-02-19T04:36:01] rosheee: I paid less for 7230
[2023-02-19T07:51:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: WTF, please come to Xelectrics with Kelly
[2023-02-19T07:55:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: You can't have better technology at same price than old technology, it's non-sense
[2023-02-19T07:56:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: I've been playing around for years with Kelly
[2023-02-19T07:56:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: But, going to VESC, better power, and much better motor control and everything
[2023-02-19T07:57:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: I prefer paying more and having better technology
[2023-02-19T07:57:34] Face de Pin Suc√©: But, I understand that some people prefers cheap and undrivable power, I get it
[2023-02-19T08:04:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: https://www.instagram.com/p/CeQ0gLtFMwH/?hl=fr
[2023-02-19T08:08:21] Face de Pin Suc√©: For the record, this is with VESC, this is on circuit, straight is only 500meters long and you have to brake before ending, only 20S This day were lot of people running Kelly (7218S, 7230S) and the top speed achieved by the second best, top Kelly then, was 112Kmh so, 15Kmh less than VESC on this setup. But VESC always burn and not powerful yes x) This day there were a Weped SST with Kelly 7230S prepared by Fastride and I have a footage where I overtake in end of a corner before long straight, the guy never catches me
[2023-02-19T09:27:27] Happy Giraffe: It was my old bootloader that made the file look like 5.3üòÇ

[2023-02-19T13:36:33] Face de Pin Suc√©: Hahaha you speak about Katana
[2023-02-19T13:36:57] Face de Pin Suc√©: Because he was like "I love the sound brrrrrrr brrrrrr"
[2023-02-19T13:37:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: And it was the ONLY reason üòÇ
[2023-02-19T13:37:40] Face de Pin Suc√©: But he pushed it up to 17Kw
[2023-02-19T13:37:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: But soon, it's done, now he's going with C350
[2023-02-19T13:44:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Possible do the same with vescüòè
[2023-02-19T13:44:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: And changing the frequency you can do stronger sound
[2023-02-19T13:44:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes I know
[2023-02-19T13:45:12] Face de Pin Suc√©: But noise == power losses
[2023-02-19T17:26:47] Mirko Boni: Hello.. Today I disassembled Paolo's engine, the 800w version.. After about 1 year and a half and 1000km it is in spectacular condition..

[2023-02-19T17:32:10] Mirko Boni: Under heat shrink plastic it is perfect
[2023-02-19T17:34:30] Mirko Boni: @PaoloWu according to you, can I set 50A of battery and 100A of phase?
[2023-02-19T17:44:22] Mirono escooters: Very good
[2023-02-19T17:44:37] Mirono escooters: It will like it with ff
[2023-02-19T17:51:04] Mirko Boni: What do you mean? I did not understand..üòä
[2023-02-19T17:51:33] Mirono escooters: Ferrofluid
[2023-02-19T17:51:36] Mirono escooters: It will be fine
[2023-02-19T17:52:30] Mirko Boni: Thanks Mirono.. Do you think it's exaggerated to set 50A of battery and 100A of phase?
[2023-02-19T17:53:50] Mirono escooters: No it's perfect
[2023-02-19T18:00:16] Mirko Boni: Tank you
[2023-02-19T18:11:00] Happy Giraffe: Temp sensors are so cool why not to put one in?üòâ
[2023-02-19T18:11:13] Happy Giraffe: Then never have to worry about burning motor
[2023-02-19T18:12:33] Mirono escooters: Gotta keep it a lil fun
[2023-02-19T18:12:59] Happy Giraffe: Degrading magnets or burning insulation isnt funüòÇ
[2023-02-19T18:13:32] Mirono escooters: Pft
[2023-02-19T18:13:42] Mirono escooters: Geared motor isn't fun either.üòú
[2023-02-19T18:18:28] Happy Giraffe: It is haha, especially when pedalling. You take bit load off the motor so it doesnt heat that much and you fly uphill
[2023-02-19T18:29:28] Mirono escooters: Boring
[2023-02-19T18:29:32] Mirono escooters: 6.6kw is more fun
[2023-02-19T18:35:57] Luis Magalhaes: I need to make my bike electric üòÇ
[2023-02-19T18:39:15] Mirono escooters: Yesssssssss
[2023-02-19T18:39:20] Mirono escooters: Build a bomber frame
[2023-02-19T18:41:31] Luis Magalhaes: That would be top, but i think turning my bike to an ebike diy was good (cheaper) üòÇ
[2023-02-19T18:42:25] Luis Magalhaes: I dont use the bike üòÇ i know i will use it if had some type of assistance
[2023-02-19T18:42:50] Happy Giraffe: What would police do in your country is they saw you?üòÖ

[2023-02-19T18:44:23] Mirono escooters: Same as what I did
[2023-02-19T18:44:31] Mirono escooters: U can fit alot in stock bike frame

[2023-02-19T19:07:04] Luis Magalhaes: <photos/photo_7760@19-02-2023_19-07-04.jpg>
[2023-02-19T19:07:12] Luis Magalhaes: The bike i want to mod
[2023-02-19T19:07:38] Happy Giraffe: I have to buy better front shock, this suntour crap doesnt work at all at 0¬∞c
[2023-02-19T19:07:48] Happy Giraffe: Rockshocks or smt
[2023-02-19T19:08:16] Mirono escooters: Good frame
[2023-02-19T19:08:16] Mirono escooters: Big batt space
[2023-02-19T19:08:17] Mirono escooters: Doggo approved
[2023-02-19T19:13:55] pinkflozd: i drive that motor at 45A / 120A phase with ferrofluid
[2023-02-19T19:14:15] pinkflozd: it's winter though, will see in summer :D
[2023-02-19T19:15:03] Mirko Boni: How are you doing? Do you think the temperatures are good?
[2023-02-19T19:17:15] pinkflozd: i have 10C outside, motor cover heats to 35C, not sure about inside temps though
[2023-02-19T19:17:46] pinkflozd: 120phase might be too much if you have a lot of hills
[2023-02-19T19:17:49] Mirko Boni: Of course you're right..
[2023-02-19T19:17:53] pinkflozd: not much difference 100-120
[2023-02-19T19:18:12] pinkflozd: just a little more kick @9kmh
[2023-02-19T19:18:25] Mirko Boni: My route is 15% uphill and 85% flat
[2023-02-19T19:18:53] Mirko Boni: Faster or more acceleration?
[2023-02-19T19:19:06] pinkflozd: more acceleration
[2023-02-19T19:19:23] Mirko Boni: Ok ok perfect.. I need acceleration..
[2023-02-19T19:19:56] Mirko Boni: @pinkflozd do you use the w field?
[2023-02-19T19:22:05] pinkflozd: yes, just 10A staring at 91.5 duty, there is like a punch of torque helping
[2023-02-19T19:22:30] pinkflozd: not much speed gain maybe 2kmh, but i'm 195cm and 95kg :D
[2023-02-19T19:22:47] Mirko Boni: Ah.. So you decreased the duty? I use it 95%
[2023-02-19T19:23:11] pinkflozd: no i mean FW staring duty is at 91.5, i use 95max duty
[2023-02-19T19:23:13] Mirko Boni: I am 190cm and weigh 97kg
[2023-02-19T19:23:29] Mirko Boni: Ahh ok ok I get it
[2023-02-19T19:23:46] pinkflozd: if i set FW duty to 90% i loose a lot of torque
[2023-02-19T19:23:56] Mirko Boni: Do you use a 16S?
[2023-02-19T19:24:01] pinkflozd: 14s
[2023-02-19T19:24:22] Mirko Boni: I have a 16S.. I hope to reach 60 km/h
[2023-02-19T19:25:07] pinkflozd: i reach like 50 gps speed, maybe in the summer a few kmh more
[2023-02-19T19:25:44] pinkflozd: i like the motor because it has torque until 45kmh
[2023-02-19T19:25:57] Mirko Boni: Ok ok I got it.. I'll try it in the next few days.. Let's see what happens
[2023-02-19T19:26:33] Mirko Boni: Will the couple arrive soon? Or after 10km/h?
[2023-02-19T19:27:02] Mirono escooters: Phase amps is low speed torque
[2023-02-19T19:27:21] Mirko Boni: Ahh well.. I get it
[2023-02-19T19:27:25] pinkflozd: I can make wheelies with it at 6kmh
[2023-02-19T19:28:01] pinkflozd: And have a konyk suspension that makes that harder
[2023-02-19T19:28:35] Mirko Boni: Amazing üò±üò±
[2023-02-19T21:07:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Currently testing the MKS 75100 Alu PCB [Flipsky copy] (95‚Ç¨) as replacement for my Ubox Single 100V 100A (165‚Ç¨). Performs well, it struggles keeping track of the high current, which limits me in power, but besides that it stays sooo much cooler! :)
[2023-02-19T21:08:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @Ghost_911 Any tricks? You had a similar issue that you got limited by smth, which we solved by applying the voltage calculation fix, but for me it is probably the duty that goes crazy.
[2023-02-19T21:12:16] Gigolo Joe: Can't figure out what seems to be the problem you're having ü§î I had problems going over 95% duty cycle mostly and pulling 150a battery
[2023-02-19T21:12:49] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <photos/photo_7761@19-02-2023_21-12-49.jpg>
[2023-02-19T21:12:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 11kW is very odd too
[2023-02-19T21:13:11] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but ok maybe very big peak
[2023-02-19T21:13:39] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I'll check the RT data later, maybe there's something interesting. Wish VESC would keep track of limiters.
[2023-02-19T21:15:18] Gigolo Joe: And yeah my duty was going a bit crazy too, no idea why. All i done was change the limitations in the code to 99% It didn't completely solved the problem but now it fluctuate only about 7%, before it was going stupid like 95-70-92-83 stuff like that
[2023-02-19T21:18:03] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yeah same for me. 99% max duty, hmmm.
[2023-02-19T21:19:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Look at my duty and after 80km/h, battery current suddenly decreases üòÇ
[2023-02-19T21:30:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes Flipsky
[2023-02-19T21:41:25] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Did you only change the setting or did you modify the firmware?
[2023-02-19T21:44:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: I burned before it reaches these speed
[2023-02-19T21:45:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt know, not the power board, stm dead randomly
[2023-02-19T21:45:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: Motor start by accelerating by itself , I braked with caliper and it dead
[2023-02-19T21:47:06] Mirono escooters: XD my vesc once too
[2023-02-19T21:51:09] Mirono escooters: Water damage
[2023-02-19T21:51:11] Mirono escooters: Throttle brr
[2023-02-19T21:51:15] Mirono escooters: On its own
[2023-02-19T22:02:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Oh that's scary indeed
[2023-02-19T22:04:24] Mirono escooters: It was fun getting to school
[2023-02-19T22:04:34] Mirono escooters: I could only brake to stop it
[2023-02-19T22:04:40] Mirono escooters: So brakes weared and hot, but had exam .
[2023-02-19T23:12:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: You'll never reach 25KW with MP2 x)
[2023-02-19T23:13:21] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: üò°
[2023-02-19T23:13:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: Single motor definitely not
[2023-02-19T23:13:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: At least actual design
[2023-02-19T23:14:07] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I reach 1w
[2023-02-19T23:15:00] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 1.1w üòé
[2023-02-19T23:22:46] Mirono escooters: Bet
[2023-02-19T23:23:03] Mirono escooters: Qs273 likes it
[2023-02-19T23:38:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: I can bet no problem x)
[2023-02-19T23:38:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: For now, we are the only one to have drive the MP2 on road üõ£Ô∏è
[2023-02-19T23:40:19] Mirono escooters: I'm waiting for my bike..
[2023-02-19T23:40:23] Mirono escooters: Sure
[2023-02-19T23:40:28] Mirono escooters: Badgineer promised meü•∫
[2023-02-19T23:52:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: No possible
[2023-02-19T23:52:46] Mirono escooters: Bet
[2023-02-19T23:52:48] Mirono escooters: Watch me try
[2023-02-19T23:52:56] Mirono escooters: It should only be peak tho . Few seconds. My weight.
[2023-02-19T23:52:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: That because fet package , not about cooling
[2023-02-19T23:53:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: Leg will melt before üòÖ
[2023-02-19T23:55:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: 7230 is 30mos to reach 300A battery
[2023-02-19T23:56:43] Mirono escooters: :(
[2023-02-19T23:58:22] Face de Pin Suc√©: Mmmh yes
[2023-02-19T23:58:56] Face de Pin Suc√©: Nucular 24F to reach 300A battery (350A actually)
[2023-02-20T00:01:45] Face de Pin Suc√©: It seems
[2023-02-20T00:02:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: Honestly, I've seen it overheating a lot in Weped SST, so I don't know if it's as good as everyone says
[2023-02-20T00:06:25] Happy Giraffe: https://endless-sphere.com/sphere/threads/mac-gmac-hot-rod-info.106101/
[2023-02-20T00:07:04] Happy Giraffe: This guy pushing 160A phase for the same motor that I have, lmao the nylon gears must cry for help. Torque must be somewhere close to 200nm...
[2023-02-20T00:08:33] Mirono escooters: Bro rip them gears
[2023-02-20T00:13:17] Happy Giraffe: I try tomorrow 90-100A
[2023-02-20T00:20:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: I tried to fit nami motor in wolf but no possible. Drop out is bigger
[2023-02-20T08:17:38] Gigolo Joe: I'm rebuilding my scooter rn, will check again once finished and update u on the findings
[2023-02-20T08:18:19] Gigolo Joe: Modify the value in the firmware before compiling
[2023-02-20T08:19:27] Gigolo Joe: I thought the same, any ideas on how to minimize it? Maybe more capacitors?
[2023-02-20T13:13:49] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I mean, we are operating it over the maximum rated values, they won't give any useful response if they even respond
[2023-02-20T13:16:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: The last time I asked them something they did not even respond, but sure why not. I'll write them later.
[2023-02-20T13:20:06] Mirono escooters: Never shot is always missed
[2023-02-20T13:26:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: It can do 200A phase no prob
[2023-02-20T13:26:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: With normal motors
[2023-02-20T13:26:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: My settings was 250A phase and 300 absolute, way over standard capabilities üòÖ
[2023-02-20T13:27:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: But the weird facts is why power board no diedüòÇ just logic board ahhaah
[2023-02-20T13:27:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: I‚Äôm used to see smoke and smell hahah

[2023-02-20T13:49:09] Mirono escooters: Flimsy soldering
[2023-02-20T13:49:28] Mirono escooters: I can test it with my internal resistance tester
[2023-02-20T13:49:35] Mirono escooters: If I find 20mohm to calibrate it -_+
[2023-02-20T13:49:56] Mirono escooters: ü§∑
[2023-02-20T13:50:00] Mirono escooters: Vesc is always off for me
[2023-02-20T13:50:23] Mirono escooters: At this point I better take a small awg wire and calculate how much I need for 20mohm
[2023-02-20T13:50:44] Mirono escooters: I mean it ü•≤
[2023-02-20T13:50:55] Mirono escooters: Or put alot of resistors in parallel
[2023-02-20T13:51:02] Mirono escooters: I only use mp2 and flipsky so
[2023-02-20T13:51:03] Mirono escooters: :)
[2023-02-20T13:52:31] Mirono escooters: Yea
[2023-02-20T13:52:34] Mirono escooters: It influences
[2023-02-20T13:53:01] Mirono escooters: Let's see what awg I have and what mohm /m
[2023-02-20T13:57:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: With which tester? 20mOhm is very very low for this motor
[2023-02-20T13:57:16] Mirono escooters: 89.2ohm/km
[2023-02-20T13:57:22] Mirono escooters: No no no
[2023-02-20T13:57:31] Mirono escooters: I need 20mohm to calibrate

[2023-02-20T14:12:00] Mirono escooters: Is a ac 1khz tester even good for a motor?
[2023-02-20T14:13:08] Mirono escooters: 3ohm ninebot motor üíÄ
[2023-02-20T14:19:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes , you can‚Äôt be sure get a accurate value , but you can compare the value with other motors
[2023-02-20T14:19:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: V6 or 9?
[2023-02-20T14:19:41] Mirono escooters: 6
[2023-02-20T14:19:49] Mirono escooters: Ahh I see!
[2023-02-20T14:19:55] Mirono escooters: Seems correct then. Biggest motor lowest value
[2023-02-20T14:20:02] Mirono escooters: And abused ones high xD
[2023-02-20T14:20:05] Mirono escooters: And cells test ok
[2023-02-20T14:20:12] Mirono escooters: 50e 28mohm p42a 21

[2023-02-20T14:23:33] Konstantin: Single cell
[2023-02-20T14:23:40] Mirono escooters: I like
[2023-02-20T14:23:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not about the size, is about the winding
[2023-02-20T14:24:03] Mirono escooters: That then
[2023-02-20T14:24:03] Konstantin: Pure nickel mb 0.15, don't remember... build it for friend few y ago
[2023-02-20T14:24:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you made ninebot motor with one turn only you could get same resistance as thunder one
[2023-02-20T14:26:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: You‚Äôre sure? I‚Äôve 1035+ and difference is 1mOhm only
[2023-02-20T14:26:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: 13-14 on first gen (bought in 2018) and 12-13 in the newest

[2023-02-20T17:04:55] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ofc not that high
[2023-02-20T17:05:24] Mirono escooters: Ye
[2023-02-20T17:05:59] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Thats incorrect then
[2023-02-20T17:06:32] Mirono escooters: Or a abused crll
[2023-02-20T17:06:37] Mirono escooters: It's correct on the other cells
[2023-02-20T17:06:54] Mirono escooters: Let me take another p42a
[2023-02-20T17:06:56] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: For very low discharge rates
[2023-02-20T17:08:12] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Good examples is around 12-15 mohm for low current. And 6-9mohm for high current cells. Ac 1khz

[2023-02-20T18:36:32] Happy Giraffe: Is there a way to make max torque with hall sensors on standstill?
[2023-02-20T18:36:52] Happy Giraffe: Mine seems to vibrate if Im not moving 1-2kmh forward
[2023-02-20T18:37:36] Happy Giraffe: And in air 20% of the time when wheel ends in bad position it wont move until I turn it by hand a tiny bit
[2023-02-20T18:39:19] Mirono escooters: Bad config of halls
[2023-02-20T18:39:26] Mirono escooters: U need to mess w settings
[2023-02-20T18:39:29] Mirono escooters: And observer
[2023-02-20T18:39:37] Mirono escooters: Halls need to start from 0 perfect
[2023-02-20T18:48:22] Happy Giraffe: How else can I make it better than doing hall detection again and again?
[2023-02-20T18:49:41] Mirono escooters: Observer and some shizl
[2023-02-20T18:49:44] Mirono escooters: Roschee typed Smth before
[2023-02-20T18:49:48] Mirono escooters: Use search function
[2023-02-20T18:55:32] Happy Giraffe: Grrr wanted it to be easy lol
[2023-02-20T18:55:35] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Make sure its hall sensor type, not sensorless
[2023-02-20T18:57:12] Mirono escooters: It's ez
[2023-02-20T18:57:13] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Foc > General > Sensor mode > Hall
[2023-02-20T18:58:34] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: And set observer type "Ortega_Original" in advanced tab
[2023-02-20T18:58:55] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Bemf decoupling
[2023-02-20T19:40:30] Happy Giraffe: I have those
[2023-02-20T19:42:40] Happy Giraffe: It spins fine without load 90% of the time but 10% of the rotation has "blind spots" that hall sensors wont see
[2023-02-20T19:43:05] Happy Giraffe: Happens also when riding, need a little turn in the wheel to start with full power
[2023-02-20T19:57:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: Lol
[2023-02-20T19:57:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: Halls need only for when current is high
[2023-02-20T19:57:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: And for start position
[2023-02-20T20:01:42] Happy Giraffe: It vibrates in place if I do little throttle from the start
[2023-02-20T20:02:07] Happy Giraffe: Turning wheel 2¬∞ degrees will result in normal spin without load
[2023-02-20T20:04:35] Happy Giraffe: Maybe I shouldü§î

[2023-02-20T20:06:16] Mirono escooters: Ah
[2023-02-20T20:06:32] Happy Giraffe: Its geared motor so
[2023-02-20T20:06:42] Happy Giraffe: Then its an inrunner?
[2023-02-20T20:07:43] Happy Giraffe: Hmm maybe measuring happens with too aggressive settings
[2023-02-20T20:08:11] Mirono escooters: Me no
[2023-02-20T20:08:15] Mirono escooters: Me work well

[2023-02-20T20:08:28] Mirono escooters: Your axle stays in place
[2023-02-20T20:08:57] Mirono escooters: Outrunner=magnets on hub and spinneria Inrunner=magnets on stator and spin
[2023-02-20T20:09:58] Happy Giraffe: Damn geared complicating, I try 750g outrunner next and aim for 50 resistance
[2023-02-20T20:10:29] Mirono escooters: U can always change urself in setup
[2023-02-20T20:10:57] Happy Giraffe: Will be back in the topic in 2 weeks as Im in train going back to barracks...

[2023-02-21T20:27:47] J√°nos T√≥th: Hi! Can anybody recognize this component? Tha labell "2J" says nothing for me. (This is a spintend 100100 power board) One of the side of this component is connected to the highside mosfet gate pin, and the other to the outputline. The low side does not have these components, just the highside.
[2023-02-21T20:29:10] Mirono escooters: Diode?
[2023-02-21T20:40:18] J√°nos T√≥th: Actualy not. I mesured it with multimeter, and it does not open.
[2023-02-21T20:41:48] J√°nos T√≥th: Only 25picofarrad capacitance
[2023-02-21T23:18:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: Tvs diode
[2023-02-22T08:31:24] Thierry: What is the most recommended motors for g30 20s? Vsett 10+? And where to buy reliable one? I've seen some motor with bad soldering. Thanks

[2023-02-22T08:55:09] Thierry: Thanks for the link
[2023-02-22T08:55:29] Thierry: I don't see the disc fixation
[2023-02-22T08:55:55] Thierry: It is probably on other side?
[2023-02-22T08:56:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes exactly, it's standard
[2023-02-22T09:01:45] Thierry: Ok and what is best with dual 20s? High kv or torque? What speed can I expect?
[2023-02-22T09:04:07] Face de Pin Suc√©: if you want speed and have high power controller, you can go for high speed, you can expect around 120-130Kmh depending on your setup
[2023-02-22T09:05:06] Thierry: And with torque one? It is probably enough for me
[2023-02-22T09:08:39] Face de Pin Suc√©: Around 100Kmh :)
[2023-02-22T09:10:01] Thierry: And compatible with pmt tyres?
[2023-02-22T09:15:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: with e-fire 10x2/2.5/3.0 :) (6" rims)

[2023-02-22T09:17:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: Its made for xiaomi rim (6.1)
[2023-02-22T09:23:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: 2.125 ?
[2023-02-22T09:28:02] Gigolo Joe: That's the torque one, correct?
[2023-02-22T09:31:55] Thierry: And 10x3?
[2023-02-22T09:32:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: Actually, can make even more torque one, didn't referenced it yet

[2023-02-22T09:50:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: You really need to add english translation (and no Google translate is not an option - like... scootermode).
[2023-02-22T09:54:02] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, but last module I tested fucked up the whole website x) so, for now, google translate is the way haha, I'm still learning from 0 on how to make a website üôä
[2023-02-22T09:54:25] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Alright, good that you at least thought about it. Keep trying. üëç
[2023-02-22T09:54:57] Jan: Deepl.com has the best translation in the world
[2023-02-22T09:56:57] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, it definitely has, but it doesn't have the possibility to add it to the website (for browsers which do not support translation on their own). The best case would be own translations, but that requires some code (or already finished modules depending on what is being used).
[2023-02-22T10:12:48] Gordan Gizdic: Polylang and than add english as secondary language.

[2023-02-22T18:39:39] Mirono escooters: Could've been way worse
[2023-02-23T06:19:45] Happy Giraffe: Do you use mobile app to tune the foc parameters? What kind of tuning settings you used?
[2023-02-23T06:23:34] Happy Giraffe: Box for single vesc to be mounted on bike bottlecage screws, will round corners afterwards so no support is needed. Also adding a way to lock the cover to the box.
[2023-02-23T07:57:17] Happy Giraffe: What motor is it? Try 750gram outrunner setting and do motor setup wizard if on mobile
[2023-02-23T10:22:24] Happy Giraffe: What setting you used to foc tune?
[2023-02-23T10:31:14] Happy Giraffe: Use 750

[2023-02-23T21:11:37] pinkflozd: yes its the same
[2023-02-23T21:11:53] Mirko Boni: Mine reached 98C today
[2023-02-23T21:12:06] Mirko Boni: 40A of battery and 100A of phase
[2023-02-23T21:12:45] pinkflozd: :O
[2023-02-23T21:12:58] Mirko Boni: I definitely burned the engine

[2023-02-23T21:16:15] pinkflozd: maybe bad connection somewhere?
[2023-02-23T21:16:30] pinkflozd: i replaced the connectors with 5mm bullet

[2023-02-23T21:20:19] pinkflozd: i have a 14S battery
[2023-02-23T21:21:36] pinkflozd: i lower the inductance by 15% so i don't have a brr brrr
[2023-02-23T21:22:48] pinkflozd: i also find MXLEMMING to work the best with this motor
[2023-02-23T21:23:04] pinkflozd: a lot more torque than with ortega
[2023-02-23T21:24:05] pinkflozd: lowering the mesured inductance helped with the cogging
[2023-02-23T21:24:33] Mirko Boni: Sorry, you too initially made the noise brrr brrrr
[2023-02-23T21:25:41] pinkflozd: yes, if i try to use the Lambda Compensation observers i get just cogging
[2023-02-23T21:26:03] pinkflozd: then with mx lemming lowering inductance by 15% helped and i get no cogging now
[2023-02-23T21:26:18] pinkflozd: wiuth ortega there is 50% torque on the feel
[2023-02-23T21:26:57] Mirko Boni: Woow
[2023-02-23T21:26:58] pinkflozd: i use the detection on the General Foc tab
[2023-02-23T21:27:32] pinkflozd: 10A
[2023-02-23T21:28:14] pinkflozd: but for the best result you must lower the Zero vector frequency to 10khz
[2023-02-23T21:28:37] pinkflozd: try to lower the zero vector freq just on detection
[2023-02-23T21:28:50] pinkflozd: then bump it to what you like when driving
[2023-02-23T21:30:49] pinkflozd: it works really reliably for me now, i don't have a inner sensor, cover is 36C
[2023-02-23T21:30:55] pinkflozd: i make 6km drives
[2023-02-23T21:31:59] pinkflozd: https://metr.at/r/QMh7E
[2023-02-23T21:32:08] pinkflozd: one of my drives
[2023-02-23T21:32:27] pinkflozd: maybe motor doesn't like 16S? and likes 14S more :D
[2023-02-23T21:33:34] pinkflozd: flipsky?
[2023-02-23T21:34:19] pinkflozd: it's possible, because with ortega i loose a lot of torque on hills, but power use its the same as with mxlemming
[2023-02-23T21:38:48] pinkflozd: yes funny, i lost a lot of time with the observers, trying to figure out how to use the lambda compensation observers but haven't figured out those jet
[2023-02-23T21:38:55] Mirko Boni: I sincerely thank you for your help
[2023-02-23T21:39:24] pinkflozd: do you have a lot of hills @mirkus74 ?
[2023-02-23T21:39:58] pinkflozd: my road is pretty straight
[2023-02-23T21:40:32] pinkflozd: i have a big hill i tested a few times, like 25% hill 1km, i got the cover to 40C
[2023-02-23T21:40:48] pinkflozd: outside temp 10-14
[2023-02-23T21:41:12] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: In the info in vesc tool it says that comp observers cant work when motor is saturated with high currents
[2023-02-23T21:41:29] Mirko Boni: No.. Only one hill
[2023-02-23T21:41:33] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But mxlemming is the best out there. But usually ortega orig works everytime for everyone
[2023-02-23T21:41:56] Mirko Boni: 80% plain
[2023-02-23T21:41:56] pinkflozd: aaaa, i missunderstood that then, i though they would help on saturated motors ... hehe
[2023-02-23T21:42:24] Mirko Boni: My ambient temperature is also 10C
[2023-02-23T21:43:31] Mirko Boni: Unfortunately ortega in my engine does not work very well
[2023-02-23T21:44:07] Mirko Boni: It's been more than a month now that I haven't been able to use the scooter because it makes this noise brrrr brrrr when I start from a standstill
[2023-02-23T21:54:35] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Wow, really interesting
[2023-02-23T21:54:55] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I am sure its not cause of ortega orig
[2023-02-23T21:55:18] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But cause of wrong motor parameters or faults with abs currentü§î
[2023-02-23T21:57:20] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Anyway, if mxlemming works for you and rt data shows good motor work - then why not!
[2023-02-23T21:57:45] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Just enjoy thenüëç
[2023-02-23T22:14:37] Mirko Boni: Thanks for your replies.. @jamessoderstrom is helping me..
[2023-02-23T22:35:20] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Got it
[2023-02-23T22:35:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Good job
[2023-02-23T22:40:21] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I didnt do such advanced tests, but some motors works with ortega orig as always and some works with mxlemmingü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-02-23T22:41:29] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: So, later, when the weather is good, I'll try to test in more detail and pay attention
[2023-02-23T22:48:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: This resistance is normal. First idea was making it with more Kv and supporting more current but less torque. But the motor was made plug & play for xiaomi and ninebot, so if Kv was too high , stock controller can‚Äôt push it. Because the peak is max 65A .
[2023-02-24T11:47:39] Happy Giraffe: If cover is so hot inside is meltingüòÖ

[2023-02-25T20:36:20] Jason Nelson: Can anyone tell me why my 75100 is giving me over voltage fault?
[2023-02-25T20:36:23] Mirono escooters: Put Voltage Limit higher..
[2023-02-25T20:38:49] Jason Nelson: <photos/photo_7789@25-02-2023_20-38-49.jpg>
[2023-02-25T20:39:10] Jason Nelson: What else am I supposed to change
[2023-02-25T20:39:24] Jason Nelson: I put cutoff to 68/60 already
[2023-02-25T20:39:29] Mirono escooters: In settings up voltage limit.
[2023-02-25T20:39:39] Mirono escooters: There's a max v limit
[2023-02-25T20:40:58] Jason Nelson: I'm sorry
[2023-02-25T20:41:01] Jason Nelson: <photos/photo_7790@25-02-2023_20-41-01.jpg>
[2023-02-25T20:41:08] Jason Nelson: Maybe there is something I am missing
[2023-02-25T20:41:26] Mirono escooters: Not there
[2023-02-25T20:41:46] Mirono escooters: I don't have a vesc now to show where settings is
[2023-02-25T20:41:56] Mirono escooters: But there is a setting overvoltage
[2023-02-25T20:48:01] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: General > Advanced
[2023-02-25T20:48:15] Mirono escooters: That

[2023-02-25T20:51:56] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Guys, question. Are there any settings to make motor starts not from zero, but 2, 3, 5 kmh etc? I cant find it..
[2023-02-25T20:52:20] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Minimum duty cycle or others dont work like that
[2023-02-25T20:53:01] Mirono escooters: That would limit throttle, not speed, right?
[2023-02-25T20:53:31] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I mean when you need firstly push scooter and then it starts
[2023-02-25T20:53:41] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Not from zero point
[2023-02-25T20:53:44] Jason Nelson: It's refusing to write
[2023-02-25T20:53:55] Jason Nelson: Every time I write and come back to the page it says 72v
[2023-02-25T20:54:16] sombre_enfant: I had it with Dashboard script...
[2023-02-25T20:54:40] Mirono escooters: Sry but, u press write yes?
[2023-02-25T20:54:46] Jason Nelson: Yes
[2023-02-25T20:55:13] Jason Nelson: <photos/photo_7792@25-02-2023_20-55-13.jpg>

[2023-02-25T20:57:07] Jason Nelson: It doesn't have it
[2023-02-25T20:57:17] sombre_enfant: Its on the g30 ?
[2023-02-25T20:57:24] Jason Nelson: Yes
[2023-02-25T20:57:46] sombre_enfant: Ah you have 20s?
[2023-02-25T20:58:12] Jason Nelson: Yes but it won't let me raise over voltage threshold
[2023-02-25T20:58:31] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Smth wrong with software then
[2023-02-25T20:58:31] Jason Nelson: It lets me lower it
[2023-02-25T20:58:40] Jason Nelson: I ran firmware update
[2023-02-25T20:59:39] Jason Nelson: I'm going to manually update
[2023-02-25T21:02:11] Jason Nelson: It has 75_300_r2 as default

[2023-02-25T21:15:41] Jason Nelson: Okay everything went fine now when I got the throttle I get abs over current and controller flashes red
[2023-02-25T21:15:56] Jason Nelson: <photos/photo_7794@25-02-2023_21-15-56.jpg>
[2023-02-25T21:16:41] Mirono escooters: How high is amps set
[2023-02-25T21:16:58] Jason Nelson: 101 phase 45 battery
[2023-02-25T21:18:06] Mirono escooters: And abs?
[2023-02-25T21:21:04] Jason Nelson: I'm sorry, I'm not sure where I would find that
[2023-02-25T21:23:49] Mirono escooters: In the same tab as current

[2023-02-25T21:24:28] Gigolo Joe: Also make sure u turn on the 'slow abs current limit'
[2023-02-25T21:37:33] Jason Nelson: Motor just clicks
[2023-02-25T21:37:37] Jason Nelson: No error messages
[2023-02-25T21:37:47] Jason Nelson: I feel the wire heating up
[2023-02-25T21:38:21] Mirono escooters: Wrong config
[2023-02-25T21:38:24] Mirono escooters: Did u recali motor
[2023-02-25T21:39:22] Jason Nelson: I'll look again but I believe I've done everything over
[2023-02-25T21:39:51] Mirono escooters: Redo motor
[2023-02-25T21:44:12] Jason Nelson: This is what it's doing

[2023-02-25T22:13:44] Jason Nelson: Yes
[2023-02-25T22:27:12] Mirono escooters: Hey nerds, do you permanently damage a cell (increase iR?) When you pull too much current for 5s+-?
[2023-02-25T22:27:31] Mirono escooters: My bike peaks 110a from 60a cells.. and idk if I'm killing it. Voltage drop is HUUGE, but.. ü§∑
[2023-02-25T22:28:55] Gordan Gizdic: Yup. Its shortening its lifespan for sure but also killing the cell. Few times no problem but over time, it will degrade
[2023-02-25T22:29:04] Mirono escooters: Oempf
[2023-02-25T22:29:08] Mirono escooters: Wonder how muc
[2023-02-25T22:29:17] Mirono escooters: Well I'm adding lipo soon üò∂ to help it
[2023-02-25T22:29:24] Mirono escooters: God knows where on this bike, I ain't got space
[2023-02-25T22:30:18] Gordan Gizdic: A lot for double pull.
[2023-02-25T22:31:51] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-02-25T22:31:59] Mirono escooters: Ok I'll mount my bag somewhere
[2023-02-25T23:21:38] Jason Nelson: 3 different motors, 2 controllers, complete wire change

[2023-02-26T13:42:31] Jason Nelson: I have 75100 v2
[2023-02-26T13:43:19] Mirono escooters: Is it from flipsky
[2023-02-26T13:43:23] Mirono escooters: Or flashed yourself
[2023-02-26T13:43:39] Jason Nelson: Yes it is from flipsky
[2023-02-26T13:43:55] Jason Nelson: I have tried 3 different firmwares from flipsky
[2023-02-26T13:44:09] Jason Nelson: Limited and unlimited versions
[2023-02-26T13:45:12] Jason Nelson: I'm about to call it a hardware issue I just am trying to rule out user error
[2023-02-26T13:45:35] Jason Nelson: This is my third controller, I know how to configure it
[2023-02-26T13:45:36] Mirono escooters: I'm not Betting on hardware..
[2023-02-26T13:45:38] Mirono escooters: That's software
[2023-02-26T13:45:46] Mirono escooters: 1000mwb is always buggy
[2023-02-26T13:46:41] Jason Nelson: What about the random ble disconnection and the failure on detection of motor though?
[2023-02-26T13:46:52] Jason Nelson: The last board looked like shit honestly
[2023-02-26T13:46:54] Mirono escooters: Software
[2023-02-26T13:47:04] Jason Nelson: All the contacts seem to be soldered well on this board
[2023-02-26T13:51:03] Jason Nelson: One of the firmware I tried after the one that came with it was 75300 for some reason was from someone in this group, then I tried the ones from the official site, it doesn't seem like any of them are working
[2023-02-26T13:52:25] Jason Nelson: I just uploaded the limited firmware from the official site and I get motor configuration not detected when I try to run motor configuration
[2023-02-26T13:52:47] Jason Nelson: I never had these issues before
[2023-02-26T14:25:07] sombre_enfant: Put the software i send if you use 75100 classic who look like an ebike controller. Check the pcb if withe "v1" files if blue and 3 shunt use "v2" files U must use no limit if you want to power your vsett motor
[2023-02-26T14:28:26] Jason Nelson: It's just the stock motor, it's not vsett
[2023-02-26T14:28:32] Jason Nelson: It's actually snsc motor
[2023-02-26T14:28:43] Jason Nelson: And I did try the firmware you sent me
[2023-02-26T14:28:49] Jason Nelson: All 3 versions
[2023-02-26T14:33:08] Jason Nelson: I just switched to a new battery and on boot I of vesc to I get deserialization of motor error message
[2023-02-26T14:33:26] Jason Nelson: Vesc tool*
[2023-02-26T15:01:54] Thierry: You must flash bootloader and firmware from same vesctool version.
[2023-02-26T15:08:38] Jason Nelson: I'm only using my phone. What am I doing wrong?
[2023-02-26T15:12:36] Jason Nelson: I do apologize, I'm not trying to be difficult, like I said, this is my third controller and I have programmed them countless times over the past year. I don't know that it's something I'm doing wrong ü´§
[2023-02-26T15:13:16] Mirono escooters: Id try a PC first and flash
[2023-02-26T15:13:30] Jason Nelson: That was my other thought
[2023-02-26T15:13:43] Jason Nelson: I suppose I'll do that
[2023-02-26T15:14:28] Jason Nelson: It's just odd it seems similar to my original issue that made me change the controller in the first place, but I've changed everything
[2023-02-26T15:14:52] Jason Nelson: The only thing I didn't change is the Bluetooth module
[2023-02-26T15:15:55] Jason Nelson: I tried two different throttles and both show consistent response
[2023-02-26T16:09:23] sombre_enfant: What vesc you have ? How you wired it ?
[2023-02-26T16:48:19] Jason Nelson: 75100 V2. What do you mean how is it wired? Battery, throttle, brake, motor, Bluetooth module
[2023-02-26T16:48:25] Jason Nelson: I'm not sure what you mean
[2023-02-26T16:49:27] Jason Nelson: Also I have been trying to find a download link for my computer for 20 minutes on the website, I can't find any download link
[2023-02-26T16:50:10] Jason Nelson: <video_file>

[2023-02-26T17:13:03] sombre_enfant: Please read rollerplaush guide and follow the instructions....
[2023-02-26T17:14:04] sombre_enfant: Delete every file related to vesc bin or vesc tool and start step by step u will have no fail
[2023-02-26T17:15:50] Jason Nelson: It's in German
[2023-02-26T17:20:33] Jason Nelson: No display to use anyway. I have set this up numerous times. It's pretty simple throttle controller battery motor. I am still getting abs overcurrent with every successful firmware I use
[2023-02-26T17:21:32] Jason Nelson: I really feel there's a hardware issue somewhere
[2023-02-26T17:22:01] Jason Nelson: All of my currents are set to nominal limits
[2023-02-26T17:25:58] Jason Nelson: What are the differences between the two different 75100 platforms?
[2023-02-26T17:26:13] Jason Nelson: I may order the other
[2023-02-26T17:27:49] Jason Nelson: Thank you
[2023-02-26T17:39:42] sombre_enfant: Tf just translate
[2023-02-26T17:45:40] Thierry: Not sure what is your issue. Download last vesctool, check your mail. Then go to firmware, bootloader and upload it. Then go to included files and choose 75_100_V2 and click on update.
[2023-02-26T17:50:37] sombre_enfant: Need matching vesc tool where the bin was made for beta version... But follo the guide and github
[2023-02-26T17:54:00] Thierry: Yes you have to use the same version that was used to flash firmware also applicable for app version
[2023-02-27T08:33:16] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Can you mark me the lines in the code? Need to know if you only changed hwconf limits or if you changed at the duty checks

[2023-02-27T19:53:06] Mirono escooters: Hy bb
[2023-02-27T19:53:27] Mirono escooters: How ez is it to program I use adc1 aka pedal sensor in legal profile And illegal profile adc2 Aka twist throttle
[2023-02-27T19:54:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Good question. Sounds easy but I am not sure if VESC provides the required functions. Lemme check if I can find smth useful.
[2023-02-27T19:55:33] Mirono escooters: The man, the myth, the legend.
[2023-02-27T19:56:02] Mirono escooters: It sound ez ye but I couldn't even use adc2 as main accelerator.. üòµ‚Äçüí´
[2023-02-27T19:57:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: So, I think it might be possible like this: Use ADC1 as throttle configured in your ADC, if the script detects that you are not in legal mode anymore, take input from ADC2 and override ADC1 input. The only thing that worries me then would be the ADC range.
[2023-02-27T19:57:54] Mirono escooters: Yes, adc range..
[2023-02-27T19:58:06] Mirono escooters: Otherwise I would just use a switch to change signal cables..
[2023-02-27T19:58:10] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Sadly it seems it is not possible to override the ADC settings via Lisp. At least my eyes does not see any functions for it.
[2023-02-27T19:58:18] Mirono escooters: Well, maybe I'm lucky, and signals can override.. but.. bad
[2023-02-27T19:58:41] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Can you show me which inputs can be taken at the ADC configuration? Tbh never used it so no idea what is possible xdd
[2023-02-27T19:59:31] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Because maybe we can make use of the ADC3 and do the mapping from ADC1 and ADC2 using Lisp and output a standardized range on ADC3.
[2023-02-27T20:00:40] Mirono escooters: Uh, nrf, conventional adc, and some other shizl.
[2023-02-27T20:01:12] Konstantin: Hm..
[2023-02-27T20:01:12] Mirono escooters: So stupid u can't use adc2 as throttle xD
[2023-02-27T20:01:59] Konstantin: <photos/photo_7801@27-02-2023_20-01-59.jpg>
[2023-02-27T20:02:09] Mirono escooters: And think Vedder is too busy for a child with stupid ideas
[2023-02-27T20:02:49] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: or use set-current instead of ADC3 and stop using the ADC app/mapper/whatever.
[2023-02-27T20:02:49] Konstantin: pin-mode-analog ; Analog (NOTE: only works on the ADC-pins)
[2023-02-27T20:04:50] Mirono escooters: Can u use 2 adc for throttle?
[2023-02-27T20:04:53] Mirono escooters: Would solve it tbh
[2023-02-27T20:05:02] Mirono escooters: Just use a (hidden) switch to enable twist throttle.
[2023-02-27T20:13:34] Mirono escooters: If I switch profiles, does input Cali change too? I could just wire with a switch to adc 1.. and when switch prfile switch input too..
[2023-02-27T20:17:46] Mirono escooters: Fuck it, if signals aren't same I don't use pedal assist, I'll be illegal for a little bit ..
[2023-02-27T20:18:32] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-02-27T20:18:36] Mirono escooters: It's only for if they stop me soo
[2023-02-27T20:19:09] Mirono escooters: Ye
[2023-02-27T20:19:20] Mirono escooters: I think I wouldn't use pedal assist.. 1 gear.. :)
[2023-02-28T00:00:58] Mirono escooters: Oh fuck
[2023-02-28T00:01:00] Mirono escooters: He arrived
[2023-02-28T00:01:53] rosheee: why can't ?
[2023-02-28T00:02:53] Mirono escooters: Can't config it
[2023-02-28T00:03:00] Mirono escooters: Or haven't found yet..
[2023-02-28T00:03:09] Mirono escooters: I need profile 2 use adc2 as throttle
[2023-02-28T01:00:31] rosheee: u changed code?
[2023-02-28T01:00:54] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-02-28T01:01:01] Mirono escooters: You wish I could program
[2023-02-28T01:01:14] rosheee: it is rly easy
[2023-02-28T01:01:16] Mirono escooters: I just wanna switch adc when switch profiles
[2023-02-28T01:01:27] rosheee: when me fit again
[2023-02-28T01:01:27] Mirono escooters: So no pedal sensor but use throttk
[2023-02-28T01:01:28] rosheee: i can try
[2023-02-28T01:01:30] Mirono escooters: So no pedal sensor but use throttl
[2023-02-28T01:01:31] Mirono escooters: Oki
[2023-02-28T01:01:33] Mirono escooters: Ty bb
[2023-02-28T01:01:35] rosheee: bb
[2023-02-28T01:13:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well ,i am interested to hear if something happens on this front
[2023-02-28T01:20:23] Mirono escooters: On what?
[2023-02-28T01:21:15] rosheee: adc?
[2023-02-28T01:21:20] rosheee: adc2 .-> throttle?
[2023-02-28T09:05:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: possible but you have to assign pinout in firmware
[2023-02-28T09:15:28] Mirono escooters: :0
[2023-02-28T10:37:08] Ohad Avishay Shatz: <sticker>
[2023-02-28T16:15:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: Switched to mxlemming from Ortega original, now much better acceleration
[2023-02-28T16:17:43] Gordan Gizdic: Faster or feels faster?
[2023-02-28T16:24:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes! That's what I mean!
[2023-02-28T16:25:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: mxlemming is so much stronger in acceleration
[2023-02-28T16:26:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: Better acceleration, not speed
[2023-02-28T16:28:36] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I would say especially on the start, it seems ortega doesn't really handle low speed well, at least in my case.
[2023-02-28T16:29:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I have a pretty strong slope in front of my house, which I drive up. With mxlemming easy start from 0, ortega meanwhile dies uphill and feels like putting power into nothing.
[2023-02-28T16:38:52] Gordan Gizdic: This is what im feeling also. Thats why i asked. Ill give it a try.
[2023-02-28T17:39:56] Happy Giraffe: What is the downsides of mxlemming?
[2023-02-28T17:40:08] Mirono escooters: It's a unpronounceable name
[2023-02-28T17:43:09] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: m x lemming?
[2023-02-28T17:43:41] Mirono escooters: Ortega sounds much cooler
[2023-02-28T17:44:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Not sure actually, but for my case mxlemming struggled on high current (motor oversaturated), which Ortega doesn't seem to care much about.
[2023-02-28T17:44:41] Mirono escooters: David ‚ô•Ô∏è
[2023-02-28T17:56:38] pinkflozd: i've noticed better acceleration too, motor needs to be tuned perfectly to work good
[2023-02-28T17:57:22] pinkflozd: Veder suggested to lower the inductance by 10-15% if running on saturated motors
[2023-02-28T17:57:35] pinkflozd: helps with cogging and mxlemming
[2023-02-28T17:59:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: We can ask directly to David üòÇ
[2023-02-28T18:00:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, foc is like that. If you want it work perfectly without tuning, there‚Äôs Chinese sinewaveüòÇ
[2023-02-28T18:01:53] pinkflozd: i also notced that with mxlemming i get a lot of noise if running over 95% duty, but that might be a flipsky issue :D
[2023-02-28T18:02:23] pinkflozd: motor sounds like it will explode :D
[2023-02-28T18:03:59] pinkflozd: it's kinda funny because running at 95% duty max it's smooth, but running with 97%max duty i get a almost failing sound right away
[2023-02-28T18:04:31] pinkflozd: must be just a flipsky issue
[2023-02-28T18:19:53] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, I also gotta find out the full torque startup cogging
[2023-03-01T02:43:55] rosheee: ^^
[2023-03-01T02:43:58] rosheee: p1d

[2023-03-01T10:51:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Or possibly anything elseüòè
[2023-03-01T10:55:04] Happy Giraffe: Yes
[2023-03-01T10:55:33] Happy Giraffe: I think motor saturation but not sure
[2023-03-01T10:55:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well mks is even worsefrom.my view and still we had zero issues ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-03-01T10:57:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Dual flip 16s 100a battery 120 phases has zero issues in Around one year of use and near that we mounted a lot ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ Zero lucky in that
[2023-03-01T10:58:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I cant say i didn't saw a fuck load of spin shits burning
[2023-03-01T10:58:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: While after second series it even gains more heat than ever ,for double the price ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-03-01T10:59:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Double priced crap and still ppl want to stress the smallest ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-03-01T11:01:54] Mirono escooters: XD yes horribl

[2023-03-01T23:35:19] Mirono escooters: Make up your mind
[2023-03-01T23:35:19] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2023-03-01T23:35:21] Mirono escooters: What's it now
[2023-03-01T23:35:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: If don‚Äôt want spend +400‚Ç¨
[2023-03-01T23:35:34] Mirono escooters: Worth 180‚Ç¨?
[2023-03-01T23:35:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: 160 I paid
[2023-03-01T23:35:57] Mirono escooters: That then.
[2023-03-01T23:36:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think it don‚Äôt worth for me
[2023-03-01T23:36:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: But for sure who have drag car yes
[2023-03-01T23:36:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: I bought it just to compare different setups
[2023-03-01T23:36:59] Mirono escooters: Just for us
[2023-03-01T23:37:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: But unfortunately my roads even can‚Äôt drive :(
[2023-03-01T23:37:11] Mirono escooters: Sadly I no run vesc on bike yet
[2023-03-01T23:37:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you want to share results nobody trust vesc data, too much people set fake value
[2023-03-01T23:38:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Every day I see in wolf group on Facebook that people shows 127kmhüòÇ

[2023-03-02T07:41:36] Unknown: u r definitely ill
[2023-03-02T09:36:45] Unknown: Can i use spintend vesc‚Äôs or others 12v output for light with mechanical switch?
[2023-03-02T09:38:42] Gordan Gizdic: Up to 3A, yes you can.
[2023-03-02T09:39:04] Unknown: Nice! Thanks
[2023-03-02T09:39:50] Konstantin: Only if esc == spinted...if others... Soso...dc-dc 1-2a max on flipsky....
[2023-03-02T09:50:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: 12v on flip in extra for lights?
[2023-03-02T09:50:48] Konstantin: No
[2023-03-02T09:50:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Than read question pls
[2023-03-02T09:53:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Thats for 5v , if you want lights you need small stepdown like 12v 3a to power stuff or adc2
[2023-03-02T10:29:10] Gordan Gizdic: @Her0DasH is right... Srry mate. Yes, for 12V you need buck (stepdown) converter. I use 80V to 12V/3A converter.
[2023-03-02T10:45:21] gil guy: Wich battery do you have ?
[2023-03-02T10:47:03] Unknown: 140a 16s and 30a 16s. I dont want to put my light to these for safety üòÖ
[2023-03-02T10:48:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Spin has it so half way you guys were right also
[2023-03-02T10:50:40] Gordan Gizdic: Fuuuck. Im so not concentrated. Damn. Spinted Ubox has 12V output for lights and it is current limited to 3A max. But i still use stepdown because its more reliable to pull power from the pack. And for that i use a relay to connect/disconnect this stepdown.
[2023-03-02T10:51:13] Gordan Gizdic: There. You can see it being turned on/off on by the switch on the handle bars.
[2023-03-02T10:51:47] Gordan Gizdic: <video_file>
[2023-03-02T11:00:19] gil guy: You can . Place four 12v led spot in serial . They accept 10>20V
[2023-03-02T13:06:53] Gigolo Joe: 180phase with 90 battery works great, would be interesting to see your results üëåüèªüëåüèª
[2023-03-02T13:48:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: I tried 100A batt and 250A phase with wolf motor, the control board are gone‚Ä¶ but the power board is okay
[2023-03-02T13:49:45] Gigolo Joe: Tried with different motors, with wolf results may vary
[2023-03-02T13:50:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: More is high the Kv more will be hard for vesc
[2023-03-02T14:12:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Flipsky 75100
[2023-03-02T14:13:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: The one i have in wolf
[2023-03-02T14:13:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2023-03-02T14:13:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: Still no, I need new board
[2023-03-02T14:13:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: The last one is died
[2023-03-02T14:13:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: Now I will try with new motors
[2023-03-02T15:25:07] Mirko Boni: Finally today the 60H engine was delivered

[2023-03-02T15:26:02] Mirko Boni: It should cool very well
[2023-03-02T15:39:35] Jan: I wonder when that releases
[2023-03-02T15:40:08] Mirono escooters: Soon
[2023-03-02T15:46:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Sick! Still waiting for mine.
[2023-03-02T15:59:17] Mirko Boni: No jan, I've already bought it.. It arrives next week.. It's on its way now..
[2023-03-02T15:59:51] Mirko Boni: It's already shipped by Amy..
[2023-03-02T16:03:52] Mirono escooters: :)
[2023-03-02T16:05:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: Should be good
[2023-03-02T16:05:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: They say are using ‚ÄúJ‚Äù fets, if datasheet is real data, then should be really good
[2023-03-02T16:08:46] Jan: And amy tells me its not in production
[2023-03-02T16:08:49] Jan: -_-
[2023-03-02T16:08:57] Face de Pin Suc√©: XD wtf
[2023-03-02T16:09:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: I think you speak about 12mos
[2023-03-02T16:09:26] Jan: Ah yes
[2023-03-02T16:09:28] Face de Pin Suc√©: But they released 6 fet
[2023-03-02T16:11:21] Mirono escooters: Safety?
[2023-03-02T16:11:24] Mirono escooters: Or that. Marketing
[2023-03-02T16:11:36] Mirko Boni: No, jan, I bought the vesc single
[2023-03-02T16:12:52] Mirko Boni: In my opinion marketing
[2023-03-02T16:15:08] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Because logic side can be not up to 100v (dc-dc)
[2023-03-02T16:15:50] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 100v on high current stage because to prevent voltage spikes during hard electric braking
[2023-03-02T16:16:54] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: for 22s actually you need atleast 120-130v components to make nice headroom for voltage spikes during strong electric braking
[2023-03-02T16:18:02] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: So you dont brake hard then maybe!
[2023-03-02T16:18:14] Konstantin: Trampa 150/750 use a lot ceramic capacitors, isolated dc-dc... And a lot of others protection
[2023-03-02T16:18:59] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Me too
[2023-03-02T16:19:07] Konstantin: For brake I can reduce amps, then battery > 9x%
[2023-03-02T16:39:43] Konstantin: Hm... found video... apply on input 96v... And looks like power consumption ok... But if found right datasheet... Tvs diode have to start work...
[2023-03-02T16:40:06] Konstantin: 94.4v start voltage
[2023-03-02T17:14:49] Mirono escooters: I have a weird question Why doesn't magnetic suspension exist? I would think we can't fit big enough magnets?
[2023-03-02T17:14:54] Mirono escooters: It would be smooth and cool
[2023-03-02T17:15:38] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Wait a minute, you are trying to make maglevs suspension on scooter?
[2023-03-02T17:15:48] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-03-02T17:15:52] Mirono escooters: I was just wondering
[2023-03-02T17:16:04] Mirono escooters: It would be smooth tho, and cool
[2023-03-02T17:16:06] Mirono escooters: ;)
[2023-03-02T17:30:15] Jan: Would be the same progressive behavior like an air suspension i guess
[2023-03-02T17:30:32] Mirono escooters: But without the hassle of air :)
[2023-03-02T17:30:38] Jan: Not super conductor but just magnet suspension
[2023-03-02T17:30:46] Mirono escooters: But I don't think we have such small magnets with such high holding power.
[2023-03-02T17:30:56] Jan: But the weight is not little
[2023-03-02T17:31:24] Jan: You dont use a small magnet
[2023-03-02T17:31:37] Jan: You use to big ones repelling each other
[2023-03-02T17:33:22] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse. I'm not that stupid.
[2023-03-02T17:33:32] Mirono escooters: But i mean, expensive and I don't think we fit that on a scooter.
[2023-03-02T17:39:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs possible, but definitely not worth. Needs super magnet and need very accurate sensors , a fox air suspension is definitely much cheaperüòÇ
[2023-03-02T17:46:46] Jason Nelson: I have gotten my controller up and running but after I exceed 30 phase amps the motor clunks out
[2023-03-02T17:47:03] Jason Nelson: Does anyone have a clue why this is happening?
[2023-03-02T19:02:58] rosheee: the DNM > FOX
[2023-03-02T19:03:12] rosheee: depends on your settings
[2023-03-02T19:03:12] rosheee: ^^'
[2023-03-02T19:03:25] rosheee: if any problems it would be best if sending XML file of your ESC settings
[2023-03-02T19:03:39] rosheee: then can help much better
[2023-03-02T19:11:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: Then send fox and I send dnmüòÜ
[2023-03-02T20:18:01] Jason Nelson: Lime 4.0 sensorless 50h motor works okay but when I put in snsc 2.3 sensors 30h(I believe) motor it clunks at 30 phase amps, even when running sensorless
[2023-03-02T20:19:26] Jason Nelson: I tried all different hall configurations and the others won't even run so I know I have the sensor hooked up correctly
[2023-03-03T03:19:00] Valentin Holl√§nder: Anyone that can help me with this problem? I power on the vesc motor spin and then vesc turn off..
[2023-03-03T03:19:39] Valentin Holl√§nder: Worked before, don‚Äôt know why this happened
[2023-03-03T08:17:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Is this new?
[2023-03-03T08:18:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Dont spin engine look up terminal and print faults maybe there is something
[2023-03-03T08:20:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You need to tell more so we are able to help, better video where we see all better might help also
[2023-03-03T08:22:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also what About your power settings? I see scooter mode battery, what bms it has? How much A?
[2023-03-03T11:09:41] rosheee: Or shortage somewhere

[2023-03-03T11:42:05] S1m 0n: And without spring
[2023-03-03T11:42:39] Gordan Gizdic: Maybe they want to push for a bit more performance oriented segment of the market in the futurw.
[2023-03-03T11:42:48] Gordan Gizdic: So this is a bit of a test... So to say.
[2023-03-03T11:44:09] S1m 0n: Yes, that may be, but at least development is taking place there and there is no standstill
[2023-03-03T11:56:46] S1m 0n: Ninebot Gokart Pro üòÑ https://a.aliexpress.com/_EvLo9HJ
[2023-03-03T12:02:34] Gordan Gizdic: Biggest market. All those much more expensive scoots are still low numbers compared to Xiaomis and Ninebot.

[2023-03-04T00:45:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: No, Ive traction control
[2023-03-04T00:45:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: I do it on another road, unfortunately dragy hasn‚Äôt signal where I did test
[2023-03-04T00:46:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: It still wobbles as fuck
[2023-03-04T00:46:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: Chinese steering damper is shut

[2023-03-04T00:48:26] rosheee: pads smoke
[2023-03-04T00:48:36] rosheee: then u have to continue riding and cool down
[2023-03-04T00:48:44] rosheee: otherwise magura gets to hot and then u have to rebleed ^^
[2023-03-04T00:49:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Xd

[2023-03-06T01:21:45] Mirono escooters: I wish dji had that kmh overlay.
[2023-03-06T01:24:48] Mirono escooters: Insta360 got it
[2023-03-06T01:32:01] Mirono escooters: Dji doesn't have
[2023-03-06T01:32:20] Mirono escooters: Altough it does have gps data
[2023-03-06T01:34:24] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: GoPro has it too
[2023-03-06T01:34:28] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but looks rather meh
[2023-03-06T01:35:09] Mirono escooters: :(
[2023-03-06T01:37:51] Mirko Boni: Also gopro has the option of an overlay.. From hero 5 version onwards
[2023-03-06T01:38:29] Mirono escooters: Defenitely need my dragy
[2023-03-06T01:44:21] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @Mirono_escooters :)
[2023-03-06T01:44:38] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: has all kind of GPS shit to show
[2023-03-06T01:44:47] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: wish it would be a little more customizable
[2023-03-06T01:46:08] Mirono escooters: GoPro right?
[2023-03-06T01:46:13] Mirono escooters: Got dji, memo :/

[2023-03-06T12:09:13] Mirko Boni: Good morning everyone.. The new vesc has just arrived
[2023-03-06T12:09:13] Gordan Gizdic: Looking good.
[2023-03-06T12:09:31] Mirko Boni: It's well built..
[2023-03-06T12:10:32] Gordan Gizdic: But does it perform?
[2023-03-06T12:10:35] Gordan Gizdic: üôà
[2023-03-06T12:12:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: It used worse mosfet than flipsky, but should be even very good
[2023-03-06T12:12:02] Mirko Boni: Handles up to 18S.. Has an aluminum pcb for heat dissipation.. Should be very performing
[2023-03-06T12:12:18] Mirko Boni: <animation>
[2023-03-06T12:13:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: The same that uses 3shulmotors all alu pcb vesc
[2023-03-06T12:13:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: G015N10 fet
[2023-03-06T12:14:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: Based on what ?
[2023-03-06T12:14:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: I and @SibClimb use vesc with such fet since many time
[2023-03-06T12:14:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: Same model?
[2023-03-06T12:15:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: G015N10 ?
[2023-03-06T12:15:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: So your affirmation is no correct
[2023-03-06T12:16:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: We talking about one model only
[2023-03-06T12:16:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you mean in vsett controller
[2023-03-06T12:16:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs bldc :(
[2023-03-06T12:16:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: So any fet works bad if undersized
[2023-03-06T12:17:05] Mirko Boni: Sorry, first let's try this vesc, then we can tell if it works well or badly.. What do you think?
[2023-03-06T12:17:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: Toll fet technology also is much much better
[2023-03-06T12:18:00] Mirko Boni: Spintend has already done several tests, they told me that the temperatures are excellent
[2023-03-06T12:18:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: That don‚Äôt makes sense, because some mosfet can work better at different frequency, and some mosfet can be have easily worse heat conduction
[2023-03-06T12:19:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: But now all best vescs and powerful controllers use those fets
[2023-03-06T12:19:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is reliable enough :)
[2023-03-06T12:20:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs more expensive be sure, but much more reliable than jsmh
[2023-03-06T12:24:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: I just remind that gate driver and resistor are made for one exatly type of mosfet, any mosfet need different gate resistor and capacitors. Yes it even works, but not well. Vsett controller use same resistors of z11x board, and it‚Äôs made for infineon fets.
[2023-03-06T12:24:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs why is no recommend put random fets until you found correct resistor value
[2023-03-06T12:27:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: Zero11x is born before
[2023-03-06T12:28:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: And the logic board is the same
[2023-03-06T12:28:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: Zero 11x uses infineon mosfet
[2023-03-06T12:30:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: Chinese technology is that, put random components. They just take care of it works
[2023-03-06T12:30:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: They just put more fets, not optimizing hardware or firmware
[2023-03-06T12:30:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: That why vesc small and big power
[2023-03-06T12:32:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: Flipsky 75100 6 fets and >>>
[2023-03-06T12:33:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: I mean about reliability, not because bad results, but very low quantity of devices equipe them
[2023-03-06T12:35:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: But had very bad experience with drone fets :)
[2023-03-06T12:36:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: Hope is different with becc
[2023-03-06T12:44:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: No lol, plugged power, armed motors, 50% throttle and one mosfet gone
[2023-03-06T12:45:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: 0 solder ball, I check 3 times when I build fpv drone

[2023-03-08T15:48:57] Unknown: I was just thinking that if dennis Can strap battery with tape
[2023-03-08T15:49:43] Unknown: If i mix somekind of glue and thermal paste
[2023-03-08T15:49:44] Jason Nelson: Battery is probably wedged between the deck and the bottom plate to hold it secure

[2023-03-08T16:13:06] Mirono escooters: I was pretty sure he prints it
[2023-03-08T16:13:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Body has dedicated holes inside , Opens contoller try where fits ,mark holes ,drill max 0,7 deep ,make a thread , mount and done
[2023-03-08T16:14:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Its milled from hdpe
[2023-03-08T16:14:20] Mirono escooters: OwO
[2023-03-08T16:14:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Whole boat is that ,not a print
[2023-03-08T16:14:27] Mirono escooters: Cool
[2023-03-08T16:14:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Hdpe sturdy stuff
[2023-03-08T16:15:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: That's why i said glue metal bottom on prints
[2023-03-08T16:15:15] Mirono escooters: Yh I do
[2023-03-08T16:15:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Good
[2023-03-08T17:29:02] Unknown: Ah yea here is holes also
[2023-03-08T17:30:22] Unknown: Soldering quality looks pretty good

[2023-03-08T17:40:03] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Wait, where is thermalpaste heatsink?
[2023-03-08T17:40:13] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Or thermalpads

[2023-03-08T17:41:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Remove all if you find such and its loose ,look over it pls
[2023-03-08T17:41:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Good question,i hope near somewhere
[2023-03-08T17:41:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I mean he put it near , somewhere while working on it
[2023-03-08T17:42:29] Unknown: Uhh? You mean this?
[2023-03-08T17:46:17] Unknown: Yeaa‚Ä¶ pretty sure those are tin

[2023-03-08T18:10:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Just clean it
[2023-03-08T18:11:50] Unknown: Yeaa ofc üòÑ my v1 also had many of those
[2023-03-08T19:06:16] Jake: 75_100_V2 = 2nd gen boxy version & aluminum PCB version 75_100 = 1st gen boxy version
[2023-03-08T19:07:54] sombre_enfant: Same for makerbase alu ?
[2023-03-08T19:08:12] Jake: Yeah those two are identical
[2023-03-08T19:09:00] Jake: the 75200 flipsky vs makerbase uses a slightly different quad op amp, but firmware should still work on both. We found quite a bit of noise on the 75200 though, so not sure how well that will actually run a motor under load
[2023-03-08T19:09:38] Jake: 75200 from Makerbase
[2023-03-08T19:10:04] Jake: After powering the opamp with 3.3v instead of 5v
[2023-03-08T19:10:29] Jake: Better, but compared to a Stormcore, still not great lol
[2023-03-08T19:10:34] Mirono escooters: Wich is better?
[2023-03-08T19:10:52] Mirono escooters: Wtf, they use 5v?
[2023-03-08T19:11:14] Jake: Right?
[2023-03-08T19:13:13] Thierry: So v1 is for non-alu pcb? I thought that v1 is for white pcb and v2 for blue pcb.
[2023-03-08T19:16:16] Jake: From the esk8 post
[2023-03-08T19:16:23] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_7845@08-03-2023_19-16-23.jpg>
[2023-03-08T19:16:31] Mirono escooters: MY BIKE IS MOVING
[2023-03-08T19:16:49] Jake: The top two are the boxy versions
[2023-03-08T19:17:31] Jake: The guy who had a Flipsky wasn't able to test it under load, but it seemed about the same at idle
[2023-03-08T19:17:51] Thierry: Ok thanks it is what I had in mind
[2023-03-08T19:18:49] Jake: The Spintend one looks like a partial redesign, so not sure how that one would work with the hacked firmware
[2023-03-08T19:20:28] Jake: I think just the Ubox is. They haven't added anything in a while to the vesc github
[2023-03-08T19:20:51] Jake: Talking about this one
[2023-03-08T19:21:05] Jake: Not sure what firmware that is shipped with
[2023-03-08T19:21:10] Jake: but Spintend is generally better about that stuff
[2023-03-08T19:22:37] Jake: Oh is that this one? https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/blob/master/hwconf/Ubox/100v/hw_ubox_single_80.h
[2023-03-08T19:23:31] Jake: Yeah, that makes sense now. Must have just released the hardware, but had been working on it for a while
[2023-03-08T19:26:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: Hello, I tested 75200 makerbase
[2023-03-08T19:30:56] Jake: Does it run well? What motor?
[2023-03-08T19:36:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: Shit, if not tuned well it always break the power
[2023-03-08T19:36:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: They used glue instead thermal paste
[2023-03-08T19:37:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: Bad caps
[2023-03-08T19:37:10] Mirono escooters: Tf
[2023-03-08T19:37:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: But the logic board seems same as flipsky
[2023-03-08T19:37:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: Did you found other differences Jake ?
[2023-03-08T19:39:10] Jake: <photos/photo_7847@08-03-2023_19-39-10.jpg>
[2023-03-08T19:39:27] Jake: Long thread on the VESC discord on these ESCs for those interested
[2023-03-08T19:41:12] Jake: the 75100 ALU versions use 3 INA181 op amps and seem to have a lot less noise overall
[2023-03-08T19:41:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: Could you link me please? I don‚Äôt found the discussion
[2023-03-08T19:42:06] Jake: https://discord.com/channels/904830990319485030/1077191261607440455
[2023-03-08T19:42:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: And makerbase what uses?
[2023-03-08T19:42:51] Jake: The same
[2023-03-08T19:43:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you need some test I can do it
[2023-03-08T19:43:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: Honestly I still no solved the power cut issue
[2023-03-08T19:44:48] Jake: Yeah, what fault?
[2023-03-08T19:45:04] Jake: Based on the noise it's probably an ABS OC Fault lol
[2023-03-08T19:45:55] Jake: We created a hacked firmware that averages the phase currents to smooth out the measurements, makes it run really smooth, but I think there are some potential issues going that direction
[2023-03-08T19:46:54] Jake: These were the changes https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/compare/master...korjaa:bldc:noise_study
[2023-03-08T19:48:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2023-03-08T19:48:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: Very much noise on bench
[2023-03-08T19:48:44] Jake: Foc_openloop 20 1000 BEMF
[2023-03-08T19:49:03] Jake: Foc_openloop 60 1000 BEMF - hacked firmware
[2023-03-08T19:49:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: Makerbase?
[2023-03-08T19:49:41] Jake: That one we just came up with a week ago or so, it's not part of any thing yet except that Github link
[2023-03-08T19:50:01] Jake: I don't fully understand the change tbh, but it made it run really smooth
[2023-03-08T19:50:51] Jake: <photos/photo_7850@08-03-2023_19-50-51.jpg>
[2023-03-08T19:50:56] Jake: Elwin wrote it
[2023-03-08T19:51:16] Jake: lol yeah, Flipsky could care less about that stuff
[2023-03-08T19:52:59] Jake: <files/fsesc_75_200_alu_sample2.bin>
[2023-03-08T19:53:10] Jake: You guys can try it if you want
[2023-03-08T19:56:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: What difference between the one you upload in esk8 forum?
[2023-03-08T19:59:50] Jake: That's my firmware with the correct header and disabled phase filters, but it also has Elwin's current averaging change to try to deal with the noise
[2023-03-08T20:00:50] Jake: Specifically these are Elwin's changes
[2023-03-08T20:04:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is different than GitHub one right?
[2023-03-08T20:05:25] Jake: It is different than the current firmware on Vedder's Github. These averaging changes were not merged with anything, they are still in a testing status
[2023-03-08T20:08:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ok, i test it and tell you, its for makerbase right?
[2023-03-08T20:08:23] Jake: It is for either Flipsky or Makerbase
[2023-03-08T20:08:28] Jake: Interested to hear how it goes!
[2023-03-08T20:08:49] Jake: It was tested on a Makerbase in the Discord
[2023-03-08T22:20:13] rosheee: yes but idk why my insta360 gps kmh is shit
[2023-03-08T22:20:31] rosheee: u can get overlays with a program ^^
[2023-03-08T22:21:22] Mirono escooters: Wich?
[2023-03-08T22:35:31] Jake: Wish Spintend used smd caps instead of leaded. This is from a friend's Castle XLX2
[2023-03-08T22:35:36] Jake: <photos/photo_7851@08-03-2023_22-35-36.jpg>
[2023-03-08T22:36:02] Jake: Do they still put the positive power wire right next to the aluminum case?
[2023-03-08T22:37:13] Jake: :D
[2023-03-08T22:37:14] Jake: <photos/photo_7853@08-03-2023_22-37-14.jpg>

[2023-03-08T22:56:51] Mirono escooters: One wheel? OwO
[2023-03-08T22:57:13] Jake: <photos/photo_7855@08-03-2023_22-57-13.jpg>
[2023-03-08T22:59:37] Jake: Not sure... but Spintend has a reputation for starting on fire on the forums haha. Post 29 in this thread has links to 11 such cases https://forum.esk8.news/t/100v-dual-ubox-fire/71625
[2023-03-08T23:03:13] Jake: Haha yeah. I've repaired a lot of vescs and have worked on pretty much every model. Some are better than others, but it seems like none are immune to failures
[2023-03-08T23:03:15] Mirono escooters: Yh I'm not too fan of spintend for it
[2023-03-08T23:03:31] Mirono escooters: Build urself always better
[2023-03-08T23:04:40] Jake: Still love VESCs though. Nothing else compares firmware wise imo

[2023-03-09T12:04:13] Happy Giraffe: Why not something like a metal band that is screwed on the deck inside? Could make it tight using some rubber pieces on top and thermal paste in bottom if vesc is built to dissipate heat from bottom
[2023-03-09T12:05:29] Happy Giraffe: Or just bend a piece of sheet metal to shape of a holder. Pay some metal guy 5‚Ç¨ to do that

[2023-03-09T12:36:46] Gordan Gizdic: Easiest was. Took me 2 mins to do it.
[2023-03-09T12:39:54] Gordan Gizdic: <video_file>
[2023-03-09T12:40:42] sombre_enfant: Did u rework the soldering phase ? U put one of the 2 wire of sensor connected to gnd ?
[2023-03-09T12:42:18] Gordan Gizdic: Still at it.
[2023-03-09T12:42:26] Gordan Gizdic: Front motor is done 2 weeks ago.
[2023-03-09T12:42:32] Gordan Gizdic: Now im on the rear.
[2023-03-09T12:42:47] Gordan Gizdic: Statorade + sensor + resoldering. The whole deal.
[2023-03-09T12:43:40] sombre_enfant: I bought those not sure if they fits... https://a.aliexpress.com/_EGrq5G3
[2023-03-09T12:44:08] Gordan Gizdic: They dont look good tbh.
[2023-03-09T12:44:12] Gordan Gizdic: Gimme a sec.

[2023-03-09T12:44:53] Gordan Gizdic: There. These work amazing.
[2023-03-09T12:45:08] sombre_enfant: Cant look
[2023-03-09T12:45:08] Gordan Gizdic: Cheap, incredibly small, very very accurate.

[2023-03-09T12:48:50] Gordan Gizdic: And ill mount with this.
[2023-03-09T12:49:05] Gordan Gizdic: So readout shoud be extremely accurate.
[2023-03-09T12:49:07] Gordan Gizdic: üòÅ

[2023-03-09T12:52:14] Gordan Gizdic: And thats it. Making contact with the metal and phase wires near hall sensors. Where temperature actually matters.
[2023-03-09T12:52:47] Gordan Gizdic: So yeah, thats the hottest spot and the sensor is rated up to 150 degrees.
[2023-03-09T12:53:02] Gordan Gizdic: If i burn the sensor, oh well... Motor is also done. üòÇ
[2023-03-09T12:58:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: Copper wire not, but magnet yes lol
[2023-03-09T12:58:44] Happy Giraffe: Spintend is goodüòÖ just buy the 4‚Ç¨ metal sheet and give it to a metal shop to bend in shape
[2023-03-09T12:59:03] Happy Giraffe: Easy and solid solution
[2023-03-09T13:00:57] Unknown: You know the prices here. When i Shake metalmans Hand it will cost 50 euros
[2023-03-09T13:06:24] Happy Giraffe: Then make diy
[2023-03-09T13:06:34] Happy Giraffe: Vice and hammer
[2023-03-09T13:12:44] Unknown: Yeaa. I have to conside that. Thanks for tip!
[2023-03-09T13:14:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: Or remove case and fix directly
[2023-03-09T13:14:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: Then better performance
[2023-03-09T14:45:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: Both are ok, the only difference is the connector
[2023-03-09T17:41:04] Jason Nelson: You can use either maybe just have to repin. I have the 8 pin controller with the 7 pin module
[2023-03-09T18:17:24] Jake: Trampa is expensive, but they do have a focus on quality and seem to do more testing before sending units out. It's rare to see them fail on motor detection which is usually a sign of poor testing at the factory. Most of the failed ones I've seen have been shorted STM32s because there is little hardware protection on the inputs to the STM32. This might have been solved in later versions though. Flipsky and Maytech just seem to copy the reference schematics with little understanding of how it actually works, then modify the layout a bit. The Flipsky 75300 was based off the Trampa 75300 schematic, including phase filters and current filters, but they changed it from phase shunts to low side shunts... and kept the current filters. Bad idea, won't work right. Now they recommend on their website to just use firmware 5.02 (pre filters) and nothing newer lol. Such a mess. MakerX and Spintend both seem to be innovating/improving the design at least, but Spintend could use a major overhall in their QC process. MakerX is slightly better in terms of QC but not perfect. Both suffer from cooling issues (maybe not the new Spintend Alu?) Lucas from Shaman Systems is a talented designer of the FOCer series, and they seem to be mostly reliable, but I can't get over the TO-220 mosfets all the designs use. He did that for ease of repair, but I think it has some thermal limitations compared to SMD mosfets. Jeff's Unity/Xenith and Stormcores are pretty interesting designs. They came about as an independent redesign due to the very early 4.12s blowing up on 12s FOC. Very very good cooling, and there is a parallel firmware option for both to turn it into a big single controller capable of 160-200A. The current seller of the Unity (Potter at MassiveStator) took money from a bunch of people and didn't ship everything when his old company Enertion went out of business. Plus the Unity/Xenith is only a 2 shunt design vs the 3 shunt of the Stormcore. The Unity wasn't super reliable. I don't like the DRV8323s/DRV8353s used in the Stormcores either. They seem to be the weak point and are impossible to get. The new Stormcore DX went to independent half bridge drivers, so I have high hopes for that one... once they get all the bugs worked out. Favorites? 3Shul & TeamTriforceUK currently. e-motorcycles and battlebots. Those guys are really active and helpful on the VESC Discord, and show their build logs of their controllers. They show both their success and failures. Some really cool design upgrades over the reference schematics are born out of all that testing and community collaboration. These are the guys who will help move the VESC hardware forward while Vedder continues to move the firmware forward.

[2023-03-09T21:01:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you put sensor by your self, use 10k, is more accurate
[2023-03-09T21:08:14] Thierry: For sure accuracy of these ntc is good, probably +/- 1% but can check datasheet tomorrow
[2023-03-09T21:13:07] Thierry: So might be a problem if I switch to spinted
[2023-03-09T21:15:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: +/-1% is resistance accuracy, but I‚Äôm talking about temperature variation accuracy
[2023-03-09T21:34:30] Thierry: Checked datasheet seems to be around 1% at 25¬∞C and bit more √† 100¬∞C

[2023-03-10T12:24:50] S1m 0n: where can you find a programmer to realize such a project? would fyver be a good alternative? something based on esp to put in between, like Koxx did with the SmartController, or n lisp script like zuna

[2023-03-10T13:14:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ive done one board, but I‚Äôve never flashed firmware lol
[2023-03-10T13:25:28] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: I'm still for a fundraiser for @kawaiinekololis he does not need a complete Iohawk but if you get enough together that he does not do that for nothingüëÄ That he also get something in return for his incredible work. and if it is not a complete Iohawk but for his Ninebot for example.
[2023-03-10T13:33:18] S1m 0n: This board also controls the brake and throttle. I imagined this simpler, as phraser between controller (vesc) and display (Kaabo/Vsett/Zero). The only relevant pins are RX, TX, GND and VCC. I would prefer this on an esp8266 or ardunio Nano. Not much schnick schnack, just display the Kmh. Battarie and voltmeter e.g. calculate the displays themselves and do not need data from the controller for it.
[2023-03-10T13:35:00] S1m 0n: I would also be willing to pay 300-400‚Ç¨ out of my pocket alone, and then make the code public üòÇ
[2023-03-10T13:46:04] S1m 0n: And with the bat+ & DS pin, you would also almost have a functioning on/off switch for vesc. On/Off is also only controlled by the display. If you hold down the power button, bat+ is placed on the DS pin in the display, so that the controller knows that the display is active.
[2023-03-10T13:46:44] S1m 0n: In my opinion, being able to continue using the existing displays would have some advantages
[2023-03-10T13:49:25] S1m 0n: True! If Koxx were willing to provide a lite version of its smartcontoller, I would also switch to a minimotor display if necessary.
[2023-03-10T13:50:40] S1m 0n: I don't like it, coz it's not waterproof. Like old vsett display
[2023-03-10T13:54:03] S1m 0n: I do not know. I know very little about minimotors in general. I'm waiting for the new Kaabo display üòÑ

[2023-03-10T14:24:56] S1m 0n: no, the display would not be legal either. since it does not originally belong to the scooter, it would be a technical change, which means that I lose insurance cover and am no longer allowed to drive

[2023-03-10T14:29:04] S1m 0n: I only use them as on/off animation. legally that would be fine. However, they are directly connected to the battery and can also be connected permanently if required, which makes the whole thing illegal again. but they don't stand out and fit the style ;)

[2023-03-11T04:28:30] Jason Nelson: If no spacer over 13cm of clearance
[2023-03-11T04:29:44] Jason Nelson: Before I had 2 stock batteries and. 12.5ah in parallel and did 50+ miles through wooded areas

[2023-03-11T04:32:31] rosheee: Yours has 6cm?
[2023-03-11T04:32:50] Jason Nelson: The max with the orange spacer has 6cm clearance
[2023-03-11T04:33:07] Jason Nelson: P100 has stupid torsion suspension though
[2023-03-11T04:33:24] rosheee: Wish 20S had 6cm
[2023-03-11T04:33:56] Jason Nelson: But you don't have suspension on rear so your clearance is consistent
[2023-03-11T04:34:19] Jason Nelson: Put suspension and replace the spring with a steel bar
[2023-03-11T04:34:19] rosheee: 20S front is stiff atm
[2023-03-11T04:34:38] rosheee: no suspension for 160mm discs and 125mm axle

[2023-03-12T14:25:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: What VESC ?
[2023-03-12T14:36:50] Gordan Gizdic: Ubox v2
[2023-03-12T14:38:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: 100V version ?
[2023-03-12T14:39:10] Gordan Gizdic: 75v, J version.
[2023-03-12T14:42:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Which ntc?
[2023-03-12T14:42:20] Gordan Gizdic: Brand or specs?
[2023-03-12T14:42:26] Gordan Gizdic: 5k, 1%
[2023-03-12T14:42:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: Beta value?
[2023-03-12T14:43:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: You set them correctly already?
[2023-03-12T14:43:26] Gordan Gizdic: Yup, both the same. When no throttle than both accurate.
[2023-03-12T14:43:41] Gordan Gizdic: I fugured it out, something with ground loop is fucking me.
[2023-03-12T14:43:53] Gordan Gizdic: Need to open the deck and check wires
[2023-03-12T14:52:23] Mirko Boni: Hi everyone, what's going on?
[2023-03-12T14:53:39] Mirko Boni: But his is really a lot .. Mine drops by 2 C
[2023-03-12T14:55:09] Gordan Gizdic: Ill reroute the wire today. Mine does it as soon as phase amps go over 80A.
[2023-03-12T14:55:22] Gordan Gizdic: That the readout is done and it goes crazy.
[2023-03-12T14:55:39] Gordan Gizdic: So im guessing that its because of that.
[2023-03-12T14:55:48] Gordan Gizdic: Maybe a ground loop issue also.
[2023-03-12T14:56:09] Gordan Gizdic: Idk. Ill do it in the evening and check whats happening when wires are far away.
[2023-03-12T14:57:57] Gordan Gizdic: üëç
[2023-03-12T17:01:01] S1m 0n: Can the normal gen1 Ninebot motor tolerate 20s?
[2023-03-12T17:01:44] Basti: Yes...
[2023-03-12T17:01:47] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-03-12T17:03:14] S1m 0n: a friend made a g30 with 20s and vesc but he says the engine gets extremely hot despite the ferrous fluid (don't know exactly what that means)
[2023-03-12T17:03:51] Mirono escooters: If u run 3kw..
[2023-03-12T17:04:03] Mirono escooters: Can it handle. "volt" is not a good question. Amps, more
[2023-03-12T17:04:05] Mirono escooters: Heat
[2023-03-12T17:04:13] Mirono escooters: I ran 1.8kw through em and is ok
[2023-03-12T17:04:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Kinda no reason to do that, but its possible
[2023-03-12T17:04:31] Mirono escooters: Or battery
[2023-03-12T17:04:34] Mirono escooters: Phase is peak

[2023-03-12T18:18:53] Jake: <photos/photo_7902@12-03-2023_18-18-53.jpg>
[2023-03-12T18:19:24] Mirono escooters: My man
[2023-03-12T18:19:26] Mirono escooters: Wich new features?
[2023-03-12T18:19:53] Jake: https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md https://github.com/vedderb/vesc_tool/blob/master/res/CHANGELOG.md
[2023-03-12T18:22:39] Jake: "Increased hall sensor switch hysteresis." This should improve the transition from halls sensors to foc closed loop under heavy current, if I'm remembering the discussions correctly
[2023-03-12T18:23:57] gil guy: You make hall signal longer in time?
[2023-03-12T18:25:19] Jake: Mostly a bug fix release. Lots of work on the vesc express logger as well.
[2023-03-12T18:28:48] Happy Giraffe: This would be massive help for me
[2023-03-12T18:29:37] Jake: Does silent hfi work on these scooter motors?
[2023-03-12T18:29:48] Jake: It's better than halls on the esk8 63mm motors
[2023-03-12T18:29:53] Mirono escooters: As far as I know yes
[2023-03-12T18:30:01] Mirono escooters: I'm so confused how It can be better then halls
[2023-03-12T18:30:44] Jake: <photos/photo_7903@12-03-2023_18-30-44.jpg>
[2023-03-12T18:30:45] Happy Giraffe: The difference between the two values isnt enough on my motor to use silent hfiüåö
[2023-03-12T18:32:29] Jake: I was slightly faster with silenthfi on this single motor test esk8. Alternated between halls and silent hfi each of the 6 runs.
[2023-03-12T18:33:01] Jake: Also couldn't feel the transition with silent hfi
[2023-03-12T18:33:32] Jake: But I realize it works best on a phase shunt esc with phase filters... and is motor dependent
[2023-03-12T18:34:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: I tested with flipsky 75100 alu pcb, but it dead
[2023-03-12T18:38:07] gil guy: Wich mode is less noisy ? I think sensored foc . But had strange noise at high current accel/brake with hoverboard hubs..
[2023-03-12T18:40:39] Jake: Hfi is stupid loud. Silent hfi is.. well.. silent :D
[2023-03-12T18:47:20] Happy Giraffe: Tuning hfi is a weekend job lol
[2023-03-12T18:47:48] Mirono escooters: Halls just work. Most of the time
[2023-03-12T18:48:10] Happy Giraffe: Could have some presets for 50H scooter motors, ebike, geared etc
[2023-03-12T18:48:35] Happy Giraffe: Damn motor saturation kills my chances for 100Nm+
[2023-03-12T18:49:22] Mirono escooters: Should have gotten a real motor
[2023-03-12T18:49:34] Face de Pin Suc√©: 3Shul C/CL700 ü•∞

[2023-03-12T19:28:00] rosheee: new vesc tool
[2023-03-12T19:28:01] rosheee: wauu
[2023-03-12T19:30:44] rosheee: <files/vesc_tool_free_windows_6.02.zip>
[2023-03-12T19:33:47] Jake: Loading time and transition between canbus sides should also be way better. It was reloading all the PNGs for the interface in a weird way. He used a new library that loads them much faster
[2023-03-12T19:36:22] Happy Giraffe: But atleast some rough estimates to start with
[2023-03-12T20:11:31] Jake: I don't think that change will affect it, but I do notice that a lot of canbus connections are not using twisted pairs. Some shielded wire couldn't hurt either. And the termination resistors are built into the VESC, and V4 and V6 used different values, so it may not be enough, or too much depending on how many VESCs are connected
[2023-03-12T20:12:18] Jake: I did a basic write up here https://forum.esk8.news/t/beginner-question-thread-2022-edition/66072/3585
[2023-03-12T20:13:56] Jake: And here (if using 5v and ground)
[2023-03-12T20:15:13] Mirono escooters: Canbus should be stable
[2023-03-12T20:15:15] Mirono escooters: On paper
[2023-03-12T20:16:35] Happy Giraffe: Wonder how shielded cable makes a difference if at all?
[2023-03-12T20:17:27] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-03-12T20:29:08] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-03-12T20:29:24] Mirono escooters: Sounds more like cheap chips and noise probleem
[2023-03-12T20:32:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: Oh please don't speak about canbus üò≠
[2023-03-12T20:33:08] Mirono escooters: Oh no we hitted a sensitive part
[2023-03-12T20:33:24] Face de Pin Suc√©: This is easily most of the bugs we encountered developping SmartDisplay üòÅ
[2023-03-12T20:35:49] Jake: Passing a crc value along canbus to make sure the motor/app config was properly received could be a good idea. Not sure what error handling there is now
[2023-03-13T00:33:10] rosheee: Y0
[2023-03-13T00:33:17] rosheee: the fucking mxcummings shit
[2023-03-13T00:33:27] rosheee: ortega real as fuck we know all
[2023-03-13T00:33:34] rosheee: it is nice when u go full retard 0-30kmh
[2023-03-13T00:33:52] rosheee: the higher the amp the less the fuck and the more the stutter and personal feeling that the motor doesn't like it at atll
[2023-03-13T00:34:04] rosheee: lemmiwings
[2023-03-13T00:34:05] rosheee: did motor wizard again and set this
[2023-03-13T00:34:08] rosheee: idk
[2023-03-13T00:34:18] rosheee: 6.02
[2023-03-13T00:34:20] rosheee: <animation>
[2023-03-13T00:35:57] rosheee: what inductance?
[2023-03-13T00:36:07] rosheee: rofl
[2023-03-13T00:36:09] rosheee: no
[2023-03-13T00:36:13] rosheee: i don't do spintend shit
[2023-03-13T00:36:19] rosheee: rofl
[2023-03-13T00:36:21] rosheee: then he failboi
[2023-03-13T00:36:25] rosheee: why not release fuckeria
[2023-03-13T00:36:33] rosheee: instead of "lower the inductance"
[2023-03-13T00:36:34] Jake: There was a bug in the vesc tool code where it dropped the 0 on the firmware version, so 5.02 showed up as 5.2. It was fixed for 6.00. So it's always 2 digit minor version. 6.02
[2023-03-13T00:36:45] rosheee: omg
[2023-03-13T00:36:47] rosheee: serious sam
[2023-03-13T00:36:59] rosheee: then i try it but there is no TRONIC 6.02 FW
[2023-03-13T00:37:20] Jake: It confused everybody so I fixed it lol https://github.com/vedderb/vesc_tool/pull/207
[2023-03-13T00:37:30] rosheee: WHAT THIS NOW?
[2023-03-13T00:37:52] rosheee: he never sends
[2023-03-13T00:37:59] rosheee: i have to write him super long email
[2023-03-13T00:38:06] rosheee: XD
[2023-03-13T00:38:11] rosheee: <sticker>
[2023-03-13T00:38:15] rosheee: OK
[2023-03-13T00:38:19] rosheee: now i have to piss
[2023-03-13T00:38:24] rosheee: GAL SENDS NEW ESCS
[2023-03-13T00:38:26] rosheee: AND SENDS FW
[2023-03-13T00:38:30] rosheee: FLIPSKY NEVER SEND ANYTHING
[2023-03-13T00:38:35] rosheee: and just wanked to my sad emails
[2023-03-13T00:38:39] rosheee: OK
[2023-03-13T00:38:40] rosheee: i try
[2023-03-13T00:38:42] rosheee: but first have to pee
[2023-03-13T00:38:47] rosheee: then i try without on old FW
[2023-03-13T00:38:49] rosheee: 6.0
[2023-03-13T00:38:53] rosheee: THEN i update spintend
[2023-03-13T08:37:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: there is a applicative crc for 'long messages' (splitted over multiple can messages)

[2023-03-13T14:22:55] Mirono escooters: Hahaha Yess
[2023-03-13T14:22:59] Mirono escooters: First open and ff motor+ seal
[2023-03-13T14:40:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Looks nice
[2023-03-13T14:40:28] Mirono escooters: :)
[2023-03-13T14:40:34] Mirono escooters: They say it has a good factory seal.. I'm debating now..
[2023-03-13T14:42:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Show inside also, interested to see as always
[2023-03-13T14:42:15] Mirono escooters: Then I defenitely have to open it
[2023-03-13T14:42:28] Mirono escooters: Idk If I wanna do it üò∂
[2023-03-13T14:49:35] Mirono escooters: But don't need
[2023-03-13T14:49:37] Mirono escooters: Apperantly
[2023-03-13T14:49:49] Mirono escooters: I quote You won‚Äôt need ferrofluid if you‚Äôre on a bike frame with that motor, it‚Äôs a motorcycle wheel. If motorcycle frame, then yes. Of course it helps, but I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs probably not worth destroying the factory seal on the motor making it more susceptible to water intrusion. I have a qs205v3 3.5t with ferrofluid and hubsinks and it‚Äôll wheelie my bike at 45-50 on 150/200 amps and goes 68mph. That motor is so oversized for bicycles it shouldn‚Äôt need cooling upgrades. I wanted to save the weight
[2023-03-13T14:50:57] Mirono escooters: Well, going high amps
[2023-03-13T14:50:58] Mirono escooters: But peak
[2023-03-13T14:51:05] Mirono escooters: Okay okay I'll open it xD
[2023-03-13T14:51:16] Mirono escooters: Silicon good for motor? Plain sealing silicon? @Her0DasH
[2023-03-13T14:55:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well i usually use rtv silicone there also ,but any neutral type what is outdoor should be good
[2023-03-13T14:55:30] Mirono escooters: Rtv?
[2023-03-13T14:55:35] Mirono escooters: Ok I got outdoor clear silicon
[2023-03-13T14:55:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You need a small layer only
[2023-03-13T14:55:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like 704
[2023-03-13T14:56:31] Mirono escooters: Ok
[2023-03-13T14:56:36] Mirono escooters: Wonder if factory seal is any good..
[2023-03-13T14:56:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I could tell you one in mannol brand also but normal silione is good enough
[2023-03-13T14:56:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well soon will see ,
[2023-03-13T14:57:20] S1m 0n: Why not use real sealant?
[2023-03-13T14:58:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What i like is when you have this translucent rtv and it turns light blue when done
[2023-03-13T14:58:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: A part of these also rtv gasket maker
[2023-03-13T14:58:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also better to know what hardens ,dries out ,also some hardens to shit
[2023-03-13T14:59:06] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-03-13T14:59:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: All i mean is know your enemy
[2023-03-13T15:00:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also some of these much more than a simple silicone,i can link you loctite version,but kinda overshot
[2023-03-13T15:00:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Half gasket maker made for heats
[2023-03-13T15:00:29] Mirono escooters: I'll just use plain Silkcon, worked wonders for all my scooter motors
[2023-03-13T15:25:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because when you have to open, you have to cry
[2023-03-13T15:34:16] S1m 0n: Why? I have had no problems with it, except that it is a bit greasy. But whether it is now greasy or like silicone remains a mollase, the work remains the same... with sealant wipe the stuff away again with silicone scrape off
[2023-03-13T15:35:01] S1m 0n: So apart from smearing there's no difference in the operation aye?
[2023-03-13T16:54:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Efficiency ‚ò†Ô∏è

[2023-03-13T17:25:16] Face de Pin Suc√©: Waiting for custom brakestuff ones
[2023-03-13T17:26:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: Time to refill
[2023-03-13T17:28:02] Face de Pin Suc√©: Refill ?
[2023-03-13T17:31:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: Unfortunately now with Ortega original has less torque at start, but I can push more current üòÅ
[2023-03-13T17:49:35] sombre_enfant: No shocks ?
[2023-03-13T17:50:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: Noüòµ‚Äçüí´
[2023-03-13T17:50:57] sombre_enfant: Is it alright to ride ?
[2023-03-13T17:51:14] sombre_enfant: What material u used for this ?
[2023-03-13T17:51:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, but I made it only for drag race
[2023-03-13T17:51:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: 6060 alu
[2023-03-13T17:52:10] sombre_enfant: I need to make shock bushing aswell idk what to use

[2023-03-13T18:00:35] Mirono escooters: I'm not getting whole stator out
[2023-03-13T18:00:43] Mirono escooters: Just adding ff and fixing sealant
[2023-03-13T18:00:45] Face de Pin Suc√©: Haha nice
[2023-03-13T18:00:46] Mirono escooters: Because stock seal is shit
[2023-03-13T18:01:17] Mirono escooters: Too much work
[2023-03-13T18:01:18] Mirono escooters: Its strong
[2023-03-13T18:02:23] Mirono escooters: Also I dont think cable will go through properly
[2023-03-13T18:02:28] Mirono escooters: Id need to open from other side
[2023-03-13T18:02:32] Mirono escooters: And I'm not doing that
[2023-03-13T18:02:40] Mirono escooters: I had to use a hammer and some helpful hits to get it off
[2023-03-13T18:02:47] Mirono escooters: I didn't scratch it or anything
[2023-03-13T18:02:49] Mirono escooters: I was careful
[2023-03-13T18:03:02] Mirono escooters: It looks nice. Very strong magnets
[2023-03-13T18:03:08] Mirono escooters: Yh but I do t wanna
[2023-03-13T18:03:16] Mirono escooters: And cable isnt going through I think.
[2023-03-13T18:03:18] Mirono escooters: Its big
[2023-03-13T18:03:26] Mirono escooters: Yh I just ff it and seal and close nowü§™
[2023-03-13T18:03:59] Mirono escooters: Windings could be Abit better but that's nitpicking
[2023-03-13T18:04:01] Mirono escooters: Ok use enough ff
[2023-03-13T18:05:38] Mirono escooters: 10ml? 20?
[2023-03-13T18:05:41] Mirono escooters: I honestly don't know
[2023-03-13T18:06:34] Mirono escooters: I'll just eye it
[2023-03-13T18:07:43] Mirono escooters: Eh.. idk
[2023-03-13T18:07:43] Mirono escooters: The air gap is also very tiny
[2023-03-13T18:08:33] S1m 0n: Think with around 6-8 u can't do anything wrong
[2023-03-13T18:09:38] Mirono escooters: Whole bottle is in
[2023-03-13T18:09:40] S1m 0n: Was count like that with 2ml
[2023-03-13T18:09:53] Mirono escooters: Gap is not filled but almost
[2023-03-13T18:10:53] S1m 0n: take your time and take it apart completely, and do it 1x reasonableü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2023-03-13T18:11:07] Mirono escooters: No sorry, this isn't coming apart more
[2023-03-13T18:11:15] Mirono escooters: I can see the gap with light
[2023-03-13T18:11:17] Mirono escooters: And it's filled now
[2023-03-13T18:11:20] Mirono escooters: 15ml
[2023-03-13T18:11:48] Mirono escooters: This motor is totally fuckeria too
[2023-03-13T18:11:51] Mirono escooters: I don't even need ff
[2023-03-13T18:37:21] Mirono escooters: Correct I need both hands to spin the axle? It doesn't feel like it's hitting something, I feel the pole pairs
[2023-03-13T18:38:14] Mirono escooters: But just to check. I didn't even bother spinning before for comparison üò≥
[2023-03-13T18:38:59] Mirono escooters: I'm just anxious for such a expensive motor üòÖ
[2023-03-13T19:13:42] Mirono escooters: Well it doesn't feel like grinding so I'm over exaggerating again
[2023-03-13T19:13:53] Mirono escooters: This ain't ferrofluid drag xD
[2023-03-13T19:14:01] Mirono escooters: I didn't add too mucho
[2023-03-13T19:14:05] Mirono escooters: It still had smile gap
[2023-03-13T19:14:07] Mirono escooters: Smol
[2023-03-13T19:14:09] Mirono escooters: Sure
[2023-03-13T19:14:25] Mirono escooters: :)
[2023-03-13T19:14:36] Mirono escooters: Yes, even scooter motor got good resistance already
[2023-03-13T19:14:44] Mirono escooters: Man, pedalling is gonna be fun without electricity
[2023-03-13T19:18:58] Mirono escooters: Pas sensor and VEsc. Wonder if work
[2023-03-13T19:19:01] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse
[2023-03-13T19:19:04] Mirono escooters: And parents :)
[2023-03-13T19:19:09] Mirono escooters: "yeh just lent my bike pedal and go"
[2023-03-13T19:19:53] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_7928@13-03-2023_19-19-53.jpg>
[2023-03-13T19:19:58] Mirono escooters: Both
[2023-03-13T19:20:03] Mirono escooters: Torque sensors exist
[2023-03-13T19:20:05] Mirono escooters: But fuck that
[2023-03-13T19:20:10] Mirono escooters: I want on/off 500w legal fuckeria.
[2023-03-13T19:20:25] Mirono escooters: But idk if I can. Have pas and throttle work. Very frustrating
[2023-03-13T19:20:53] Mirono escooters: Yes, but. Throttle will have diff adc then pas.
[2023-03-13T19:21:17] Mirono escooters: I mean, pas √ßant be hard to arduino fuckeria it. Just, if magnets in pas turn, give 3v throttle signal Yeh ok I'll make it work
[2023-03-13T19:21:23] Mirono escooters: And a switch for throttle
[2023-03-13T19:21:26] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2023-03-13T19:21:47] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2023-03-13T19:21:49] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-03-13T19:21:51] Mirono escooters: Parents
[2023-03-13T19:22:01] Mirono escooters: Ezpz pas fix, legal limit 250w in app
[2023-03-13T19:22:08] Mirono escooters: And then a switch to disable /enable throttle
[2023-03-13T19:22:15] Mirono escooters: And have pas like 3v output so it acts like a adc
[2023-03-13T19:24:37] Mirono escooters: Yh
[2023-03-13T19:24:42] Mirono escooters: Pas doesn't work like that tho
[2023-03-13T19:24:45] Mirono escooters: It magnet that pass
[2023-03-13T19:24:48] Mirono escooters: So Arduino it ezpz
[2023-03-13T19:24:54] Mirono escooters: Isn't hard
[2023-03-13T19:25:07] Mirono escooters: Now mount pas
[2023-03-13T19:27:04] Mirono escooters: Nop
[2023-03-13T19:27:07] Mirono escooters: Simple magnet
[2023-03-13T19:32:16] Mirono escooters: The question of 1 million... Do I go bike brakes 4 piston all fuckeria 203mm Or do I cnc brakes and adaptors.. motorbike style .
[2023-03-13T19:32:22] Mirono escooters: Tru
[2023-03-13T19:33:00] Mirono escooters: But this bike is gonna be heavy af
[2023-03-13T19:33:01] Mirono escooters: And speedy
[2023-03-13T19:33:26] Mirono escooters: :/
[2023-03-13T19:33:42] Mirono escooters: Idk I don't feel like spending 300‚Ç¨ on brakes to then rethink XD
[2023-03-13T19:33:53] Mirono escooters: And I'm not stealing it from old bike
[2023-03-13T19:34:24] Mirono escooters: Let's start with bicycle because manufacturing adaptors for motorbike brakes isn't as easy as it sodunds
[2023-03-13T19:36:16] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse
[2023-03-13T19:36:37] Mirono escooters: But a oil reservoir is a +, thiccer is better, and bigger
[2023-03-13T19:41:01] Mirono escooters: None
[2023-03-13T19:43:31] Mirono escooters: Does VEsc support pas?
[2023-03-13T19:43:34] Mirono escooters: I read somewhere it doesnt
[2023-03-13T19:43:40] Mirono escooters: But then still problem exists profiles can't switch that.
[2023-03-13T19:43:47] Mirono escooters: It sucks
[2023-03-13T19:44:37] Mirono escooters: Oh
[2023-03-13T19:44:43] Mirono escooters: Ok that solves it
[2023-03-13T19:44:46] Mirono escooters: How to wire pas?
[2023-03-13T19:44:56] Mirono escooters: I can just disable throttle with a button
[2023-03-13T19:45:25] Mirono escooters: Lol someone asked on VEsc site. No answers
[2023-03-13T19:54:57] Mirono escooters: :)
[2023-03-13T19:55:06] Mirono escooters: I asked discord too
[2023-03-13T19:55:09] Mirono escooters: It isn't common to use pas
[2023-03-13T19:55:11] Mirono escooters: But. I have to
[2023-03-13T19:55:13] Mirono escooters: Kinda
[2023-03-13T19:57:11] Mirono escooters: Tru
[2023-03-13T20:01:38] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_7929@13-03-2023_20-01-38.jpg>
[2023-03-13T20:49:41] Mirono escooters: If it even exists for bomber frame
[2023-03-13T21:03:09] Mirono escooters: I just know it's magnet passing by idk what makes signal
[2023-03-13T21:03:19] Mirono escooters: Quadrature is 2 wire
[2023-03-13T23:52:01] S1m 0n: From my colleagues the 20s g30 was collected today by the police . Not even a week of fun had with him üò¢
[2023-03-13T23:52:51] Mirono escooters: Noooo
[2023-03-13T23:57:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: But you can go 400kmh with car üòè
[2023-03-13T23:57:57] S1m 0n: Rip
[2023-03-13T23:58:17] Mirono escooters: Whatever gives them the most money
[2023-03-13T23:58:27] Mirono escooters: Corrupt stupid country, sorry Simonüò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è
[2023-03-14T00:02:50] S1m 0n: From my colleague the g30. They said they have seen him driving too fast ... I do not know if that is right, but the scooter is first time gone and is examined. Then everything will be noticed anyway. Probably they have really seen him driving too fast and are 100% sure that they will find something @jamessoderstrom
[2023-03-14T00:03:13] Mirono escooters: If they see you drive to fast, you fucked
[2023-03-14T00:03:33] Mirono escooters: If they stop me on bike and can't prove it can go to quick. No point But if they measured/saw. Fuck
[2023-03-14T00:06:53] S1m 0n: They have also stopped me many times (over 15x in 2y) Sometimes because I should have been too fast. Often I knew but that I was not, because I was really in slow mode ;). But from 15x control have made the 4x a test drive, from entrainment was never the talk
[2023-03-14T00:08:07] S1m 0n: The script was buggy. He tried to update vesc at the station and closed the app, hoping to have broken the vesc.
[2023-03-14T00:08:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: Simon you use vesc?
[2023-03-14T00:08:34] S1m 0n: No
[2023-03-14T00:08:50] S1m 0n: Coz there is no display what's looks legal
[2023-03-14T00:17:11] S1m 0n: I have a speedlimiter, with a realy and potentiometer between the throttle and the input from the controller. Can this method also work with vesc ? It seems that not all scooters are compatible with this method.
[2023-03-14T00:17:12] S1m 0n: <photos/photo_7932@14-03-2023_00-17-12.jpg>
[2023-03-14T00:18:37] Mirono escooters: VEsc use power control
[2023-03-14T00:18:52] Mirono escooters: Wonder if you can set it speed based
[2023-03-14T00:19:14] S1m 0n: Not really, but u can lower the power, that it's not spin faster
[2023-03-14T00:19:29] Mirono escooters: In air will still hit max speed
[2023-03-14T00:19:32] Mirono escooters: And on rolls too
[2023-03-14T00:19:32] Mirono escooters: :/
[2023-03-14T00:19:35] S1m 0n: No
[2023-03-14T00:19:43] Mirono escooters: ü§®
[2023-03-14T00:19:49] Mirono escooters: In air is like 50w draw lol
[2023-03-14T00:20:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: Vesc can limit power and speed
[2023-03-14T00:20:14] Mirono escooters: Just software profile way ez
[2023-03-14T00:20:36] Mirono escooters: Sad we can't change profiles with like a button?
[2023-03-14T00:20:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: Chinese controllers can‚Äôt :(
[2023-03-14T00:20:59] Mirono escooters: My Esc china has a 25kmh limit if connect 2 wire lol
[2023-03-14T00:21:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: Vesc can set automatically legal profile after reboot
[2023-03-14T00:21:19] Mirono escooters: Ye but to access illegal gotta access phone
[2023-03-14T00:21:24] Mirono escooters: So everytime I depart I gotta take phone
[2023-03-14T00:21:51] S1m 0n: I always thought the contoler give less volts, more amps in the lower range. The fets then switch e.g. only 24V/80A and when it turns faster 36V/60A (example)
[2023-03-14T00:22:16] Mirono escooters: Yes but in air wi'll always hit max speed
[2023-03-14T00:22:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: Controller push current based on the load
[2023-03-14T00:23:11] Mirono escooters: Ps fets cant change voltage, you just make pwm different
[2023-03-14T00:23:33] S1m 0n: Yes that's what I mean.
[2023-03-14T00:23:56] S1m 0n: So I use 20k Poti to get not faster as 22kmh
[2023-03-14T00:24:02] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_7933@14-03-2023_00-24-02.jpg>
[2023-03-14T00:24:04] Mirono escooters: From our friend David :)
[2023-03-14T00:24:11] S1m 0n: If u stand up, it's feel badder than a stock 1s
[2023-03-14T00:24:18] Mirono escooters: That's with speed based throttles?
[2023-03-14T00:24:53] S1m 0n: Don't know, what Mantis or Vsett use ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2023-03-14T00:25:31] Mirono escooters: Problably speedbased. Most have
[2023-03-14T00:25:34] Mirono escooters: I hate it
[2023-03-14T00:26:35] S1m 0n: What is wrong on speed based?
[2023-03-14T00:27:36] S1m 0n: I remember the pro2 with XioaDash, it was faster in the speed algorithm than in the power algorithm.
[2023-03-14T00:27:58] S1m 0n: Oh power is for drag
[2023-03-14T00:29:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Lol, speed algorithm don‚Äôt made the speed
[2023-03-14T00:30:45] S1m 0n: No, but the power is controlled by speed
[2023-03-14T00:31:07] S1m 0n: On power mode controlled on throttle, aye?
[2023-03-14T00:33:25] S1m 0n: Maybe I buy davega x display, but it bothers me that there is no bracket in landscape for the handlebars
[2023-03-14T00:33:37] Mirono escooters: Power feels way better like car
[2023-03-14T00:33:44] Mirono escooters: I'll print it if u draw it
[2023-03-14T00:34:31] S1m 0n: I can not, broke through my laptop last weekendü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2023-03-14T00:36:49] S1m 0n: Got on it, touchscreen is broken, won't even let me innden device manager to disable the touchscreen, although everything else works üòµ‚Äçüí´
[2023-03-14T00:41:46] S1m 0n: I have also asked eggrider if they plan to order compatibility with vesc... they say they can't because of the licenses, because they would have to release their code. Is that true that the open source licenses prevent vendors from making a compatibility?
[2023-03-14T05:24:56] Mihail: If you use code with GPL license and do modifications to it, you must publish your code. Im all about open-source, but understand that if they do publish their code the market will flood with cheaper eggrider clones and lower their profits, potentially killing the company.
[2023-03-14T05:28:50] Mihail: This is also the reason Denis covers the Rita in resin, because the pcb design and schematic will get reverse-engineered, become public eventually and chinese clones will appear.
[2023-03-14T05:40:57] Mihail: What they can do is release a retranslator board that translates the vesc protocol to a protocol their device supports and make that open-source. This way they avoid sharing eggrider code and gain new users
[2023-03-14T07:47:52] S1m 0n: How is it then possible that the Davega X Dsipaly or soon the SmartDisplay exist ? @Mtochev
[2023-03-14T07:50:04] S1m 0n: I think that did nothing. I have already seen on Ali Expresssomething like
[2023-03-14T07:51:21] S1m 0n: Something like that https://a.aliexpress.com/_EGAp775
[2023-03-14T07:53:24] Mihail: This is not even close to rita's functionality
[2023-03-14T07:54:24] Mihail: Read the description
[2023-03-14T07:56:11] Mihail: I believe the SmartDisplay is open-source. Also, the whole gpl thing is valid only if the project owner sues the person who violated the license. This rarely happens
[2023-03-14T07:56:16] S1m 0n: Sounds for me like Rita ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2023-03-14T07:59:27] Mihail: Nope, there are not even remotely the same. -rita supports different batteries, chinese one supports batteries of the same voltage -rita has protection against regen overvoltage, chinese one does not -rita communicates with xiaomi controller, chinese one does not I wouldnt buy any of them, but If I had to choose It will be Rita
[2023-03-14T08:01:05] Mihail: Also the chinese one does not run them in parallel. Only switches to the second one when the first one depletes
[2023-03-14T08:12:03] S1m 0n: That's right, I hadn't thought of the surrounding area. But from the basic idea it corresponds to the Rita module
[2023-03-14T09:09:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope. not open source for the smartdisplay üòâüòÖ
[2023-03-14T10:43:46] S1m 0n: Not open source anymore, But earlier versions forked https://github.com/ImpulseRC/SmartController_SmartDisplay_ESP32/network/members
[2023-03-14T11:29:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: Never was open source , the earlier version yes
[2023-03-14T11:43:12] Mihail: You're right, I was thinking about including the protocol header files, but thats not really necessary nor can be proven. Maybe Eggrider's issue is the VESC trademarked name?
[2023-03-14T14:35:53] Gigolo Joe: I don't get it, u guys build some serious stuff and u don't run away from the cops?
[2023-03-14T14:37:44] Gigolo Joe: It's actually doable, @Calip3r did it using lisp
[2023-03-14T14:38:05] Mirono escooters: Oo
[2023-03-14T14:38:34] S1m 0n: My friend says he was standing for a few minutes. Then a patrol car came and said they saw him driving fast earlier. I find that hard to imagine too, but maybe they have it on video, then they would have the proof they need ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2023-03-14T14:39:40] Gigolo Joe: Wtf, so they can come to everyone and say 'ayy u, we saw u going too fast'
[2023-03-14T14:39:54] Mirono escooters: Very sketchy
[2023-03-14T14:40:24] Mirono escooters: Need to catch u while doing it
[2023-03-14T14:40:48] Gigolo Joe: Where i live, once people with serious builds see cops approach from distance, they just send it and gtfo
[2023-03-14T14:41:11] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-03-14T14:42:26] S1m 0n: No, they can't. Therefore, I suspect that they have it on video and are 100% sure that they will find something in the expert opinion. Without a rebuttable initial suspicion, no expert opinion.
[2023-03-14T14:43:04] Gigolo Joe: Damn, wild
[2023-03-14T14:43:40] S1m 0n: Maybe just the license plate number or a passerby squealed
[2023-03-14T14:44:36] Ofek üê•: You can see the script in action, limiting to 25Kmh and 50% current. Press brake and throttle for 1 second and you're in "safe mode" Press them for ~10 seconds and you get full parameters.
[2023-03-14T14:44:38] Mirono escooters: Why have a license plate when u illegzl
[2023-03-14T14:44:57] Mirono escooters: Can u share lisp script? Pls? üò≥
[2023-03-14T14:46:02] Gigolo Joe: <animation>
[2023-03-14T14:48:21] Gigolo Joe: License plate? They tried to pass here a law that requires u to have a license plate on your pev, needless to say - it didn't worked out üòÇ
[2023-03-14T14:52:12] Ofek üê•: Sure, but it will take few days until I get to my computer/scooter üôà
[2023-03-14T14:52:48] Mirono escooters: My bike in still in parts. No hurry
[2023-03-14T14:53:08] Mirono escooters: In the final act, I'd like one that needs unlocking with rfid,or something. Something smart
[2023-03-14T14:53:15] Mirono escooters: I'll figure it out. Just wondering how the code worns
[2023-03-14T14:55:27] S1m 0n: RFID = Big, NFC = small, Bluetooth or WLAN bacon = needs much power for standby, magnetic switch = smart ?
[2023-03-14T14:55:43] Mirono escooters: Magnetic switch I like
[2023-03-14T14:55:52] Mirono escooters: Nfc maybe
[2023-03-14T14:56:01] Mirono escooters: Bluetooth was a idea, encrypted simple thing.
[2023-03-14T14:56:16] Mirono escooters: And with my 4kwh, I don't think much standby matter :)
[2023-03-14T14:56:23] Mirono escooters: I'll figure sMth out once it's together and actually riding
[2023-03-14T14:57:50] S1m 0n: Or 433Mhz Relay
[2023-03-14T15:00:28] S1m 0n: My friend said, that the police said: Within 3 days a judge decides whether the scooter should be examined more closely. If so it will take a while Certainly 2-3 months
[2023-03-14T15:00:47] Mirono escooters: ü•≤
[2023-03-14T15:00:50] Mirono escooters: Clown state
[2023-03-14T15:01:03] Mirono escooters: Just taking away transport
[2023-03-14T15:01:08] S1m 0n: So by the end of the week he'll either have it back or they'll have caught it
[2023-03-14T15:01:33] Mirono escooters: Hey this is smart
[2023-03-14T15:01:49] Mirono escooters: Just have a small relay wich connects the switch pins
[2023-03-14T15:01:59] Mirono escooters: But, if police confiscate, and open, they bypass relay, and fucked
[2023-03-14T15:02:00] S1m 0n: Yep
[2023-03-14T15:02:09] Mirono escooters: It has to be police proof
[2023-03-14T15:02:36] S1m 0n: Ever think what u put it in, can be found
[2023-03-14T15:02:40] Mirono escooters: Are profiles on phone or VEsc?

[2023-03-15T01:44:37] Martin Kaktits: Hey. Someone knows a thing about this thing? Specifically the on/ off switching. I have a key switch with voltmeter built in and I am not sure how to make them be friends. In my current setup the key switches 60v for some buck converters, which then provide 5v, 12v for lights and shows batt. voltage in its built in lil display. Would be very nice if i could just flip one key and power on everything without resorting to seperate button for esc. But how? What exactly are the minimum power on requirements - short 5v pin to "switch" pin? Since the voltmeter key switches 60v, thats not going to exactly work - not directly anyway. Can I use 5v from the buck converters somehow?
[2023-03-15T01:45:14] Martin Kaktits: this kind of key switch
[2023-03-15T10:14:38] Mirono escooters: If profiles r on phone, how can lisp change profiles?
[2023-03-15T10:59:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Default the controller is always on, so when you turn on the key the controller will turn off
[2023-03-15T11:01:00] Martin Kaktits: wait, what, really? U just plug in battery and its on?
[2023-03-15T11:01:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: In my case the lisp will override the same settings like your VESC Tool does.
[2023-03-15T11:02:07] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: If you apply VESC profiles it overrides erpm, watts etc
[2023-03-15T11:11:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2023-03-15T11:13:14] Martin Kaktits: Then the question becomes: how do I turn it off üòÖ Again, normally the "latching switch" connects "5v" pin to "switch" pin and .. that makes it turn OFF?
[2023-03-15T11:13:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes
[2023-03-15T11:13:58] Martin Kaktits: <sticker>
[2023-03-15T11:14:03] Martin Kaktits: Interesting
[2023-03-15T11:17:11] Face de Pin Suc√©: You can also say "shitty"
[2023-03-15T11:18:16] Martin Kaktits: why
[2023-03-15T11:42:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: Because it's shitty how it works
[2023-03-15T11:45:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: At least better than flipsky that you can‚Äôt turn off
[2023-03-15T11:47:39] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes of course
[2023-03-15T11:48:43] Kris: That's why we have bluetooth in bms to turn outputs off with phone
[2023-03-15T11:49:18] Martin Kaktits: what the hell i am learning now? ü§£
[2023-03-15T11:50:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, after much times you do that mosfet will die
[2023-03-15T11:50:15] S1m 0n: Flipsky Alu can't turn of?
[2023-03-15T11:50:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: Only if bms has precharge function then mosfet can avoid spark
[2023-03-15T11:50:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: Sadly not
[2023-03-15T11:50:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: Problem isn‚Äôt the space be sure
[2023-03-15T11:51:20] S1m 0n: I thought it might. That explains why the switch has not worked with my colleague ü§£
[2023-03-15T11:51:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs the pcb, pretty void üòÇüòÇ
[2023-03-15T11:51:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: What mean not works? You don‚Äôt have even the connector for it
[2023-03-15T11:51:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Where he connected to?
[2023-03-15T11:52:45] S1m 0n: Oh I was wrong. He has a button on antispark modul
[2023-03-15T11:58:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: no if you use ANT BMS they are protected ;)
[2023-03-15T11:59:01] S1m 0n: Yes ant have PreCharge Function. Now I know, for what it is. Thanks üëç
[2023-03-15T12:02:45] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, you can hear it very well when using huge controller, such as C700 (many capacitors), precharge does amazing job
[2023-03-15T12:04:16] S1m 0n: With 20A PreCharge was my scooter in cold days always go out. I have PreCharge then increased to 30A, since then no starting problems. Is the value in order ? üòÑ. With a 13s/33A controller
[2023-03-15T12:10:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, I like ant, but ant doesn‚Äôt have Suce balance
[2023-03-15T12:11:12] S1m 0n: not? I find them better than LLT. my battery has had 0.001 diff for months
[2023-03-15T12:11:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: I mean balance current
[2023-03-15T12:11:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ant has 150mA only
[2023-03-15T12:11:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: Jk 2A
[2023-03-15T12:12:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Nope :(
[2023-03-15T12:12:08] S1m 0n: oh yeah, that's a different house number üòÑ
[2023-03-15T12:32:17] Konstantin: Ant bms more than 20a precharge really often time fets blow up...and white magic smoke go out...
[2023-03-15T12:33:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: Well, when you have a good battery, you don't need huge balancing
[2023-03-15T12:33:13] S1m 0n: How can this be when the scooter does not start with 20A stock ?
[2023-03-15T12:33:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: Precharge > active balancing x)
[2023-03-15T12:33:32] Konstantin: Open battery, take multimeter and check all...mb magic 0.001 it's only magic ;)
[2023-03-15T12:34:04] Face de Pin Suc√©: ??
[2023-03-15T12:34:22] Konstantin: Jk 100a+ version 99% has precharge too
[2023-03-15T12:34:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: No
[2023-03-15T12:34:38] Face de Pin Suc√©: We have here
[2023-03-15T12:34:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: No precharge at all

[2023-03-15T12:35:29] S1m 0n: What should bring with a multimeter on the battery? If then I would have to check each individual block... for that it then instead of 0.001 maybe 0.002-0.005 are... no you, let time is not worth the effort to me ü§£
[2023-03-15T12:35:31] Konstantin: 1fets +2 resistor...
[2023-03-15T12:39:28] Konstantin: Probably
[2023-03-15T12:39:44] Konstantin: Ant not recommend set more than 20a on precharge
[2023-03-15T12:40:21] Konstantin: –í–æ—Ç —Ç–∞–∫–æ–π
[2023-03-15T12:42:11] Konstantin: Only llt bms allow to calibrate each cell voltage measure
[2023-03-15T12:45:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: No lol, I can precharge with simple button (diy with 1$ budget), active balancing need a new board that cost 100$üòÇ
[2023-03-15T12:46:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: I just added a switch with 100Ohm 1W resistor and made it easy
[2023-03-15T12:49:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: When you have much cells from different batch , it could be unstable with such high discharge and charge current
[2023-03-15T12:49:44] Face de Pin Suc√©: I don't do this x)

[2023-03-15T14:00:43] Konstantin: Am read a lot of forums rus/eu, all saying 20a precharge max ;)
[2023-03-15T14:01:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: Precharge should help to avoid this, how it can let it happen lol
[2023-03-15T14:01:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: Also single fet can support more than 20A precharge
[2023-03-15T14:06:03] D J: Agree. I think they could have a wiring diagram or everything already with plugs to facilitate less experienced people. So many people won't buy because then they can't make the connections

[2023-03-16T14:56:09] Jason Nelson: Has anyone tried the boosted rev motor?
[2023-03-16T14:58:55] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Oh, thats good scooter.. but pretty old already. In 2018-2019 it was top notch of the models
[2023-03-16T14:59:41] Jason Nelson: I was reading reviews, it looks really good, I'm interested in the performance of the motor
[2023-03-16T15:01:16] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Even now it has prettier systems and design than some other scooters
[2023-03-16T15:01:38] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: All i know that on 20s it can do 100kmh
[2023-03-16T15:01:44] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: With load
[2023-03-16T15:01:51] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But nuc controller
[2023-03-16T15:02:05] Jason Nelson: Agreed, I need suspension myself, but the design is very sleek
[2023-03-16T15:02:30] Jason Nelson: If I could figure out suspension to mount on the rear it might be worth it
[2023-03-16T15:02:49] Jason Nelson: Only problem will be finding replacement parts in the future because it's been discontinued
[2023-03-16T15:03:29] Jason Nelson: Speed is nice but I'm really a torque fan
[2023-03-16T15:58:10] Jake: Great find. The 19 makes more sense to me. You should subtract the Wh charged from drawn to get total efficiency. the 21 looks like it's using an ABS function so it adds the two together. EDIT: had that backwards. I'll look a little deeper into it
[2023-03-16T17:18:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i use the boosted rev with spintend 75/100 dual. original motors. heat a lot. 25mm magnets üòÖ i push 5-6kw total.
[2023-03-16T17:35:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: In dual motor it‚Äôs good
[2023-03-16T17:36:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i don't push too much/often, and since there are temp sensors in motors, in hot summer, vesc can limit the power. i also added the magnetic/liquid cooler inside the motor (i don't remember the name)
[2023-03-16T17:36:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: We peaked 4kW in xiaomi single motor engine 25mmüòÇüòÇ

[2023-03-17T07:38:01] chris: Hey Guy's. What speed is posibil with max g30 2nd motor and 48 volt battery on 75100? And how much voltage can this motor handle before he smokes up?
[2023-03-17T07:39:37] chris: And the same question on Monorim u5 motor?
[2023-03-17T11:40:40] Mirono escooters: Around 45-48kmh
[2023-03-17T11:40:45] Mirono escooters: Ieuw. Just dont
[2023-03-17T11:41:09] Mirono escooters: V ain't smoking it
[2023-03-17T11:41:22] Mirono escooters: 1500w+- is the safe maw
[2023-03-17T11:43:42] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Maybe its 250-300v+ and after it can break through phases. For the motor, amps are much more important, they create work and they heat it, not voltage
[2023-03-17T11:52:02] Mirono escooters: Wasn't it more like 1-2kv Anyway, the point is clear I think xD
[2023-03-17T11:52:28] Mirono escooters: Hm
[2023-03-17T11:53:02] Mirono escooters: 50‚Ç¨ for 1 203mm
[2023-03-17T12:36:52] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 1-2Kv? Maybe, i dont know, I didnt test it on that voltage :))
[2023-03-17T12:37:20] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But i think on 400v the motor will break through already
[2023-03-17T12:38:33] Mirono escooters: Enamel approx 1-2kv as far as I know
[2023-03-17T12:38:46] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-03-17T12:38:51] Mirono escooters: Why even 400v. kV go brr
[2023-03-17T12:40:27] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You can test it if you want
[2023-03-17T12:40:49] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But very dangerous
[2023-03-17T12:40:59] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: dont recommend

[2023-03-18T18:55:21] Ofek üê•: Sharing my police mode Lisp script, hopefully you wont need it. The script requires both ADC1 and ADC2 configured. To change modes you have to come to a complete stop (from at least ~10kmh ). Hold the brake for a minimum of 1.5 seconds and then short pressing the throttle will put scooter into locked mode. Hold for a minimum of 5.5 seconds and then short pressing the throttle will put scooter into unlocked mode. Use at your own risk ü•∏

[2023-03-18T23:34:29] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Also there is vesc misreading fail also
[2023-03-18T23:34:49] Mirko Boni: @jamessoderstrom told me there is a lot of difference
[2023-03-18T23:34:50] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Just tune it some times
[2023-03-18T23:35:12] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: What motors?
[2023-03-18T23:35:19] Mirko Boni: Ok.. In fact the scooter is not perfect..

[2023-03-18T23:36:52] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Did you open both motors and checked it on heat melts?
[2023-03-18T23:37:14] Mirko Boni: I've never opened the engines.
[2023-03-18T23:37:50] Mirko Boni: 70A of battery and 150A of phase are perfect.. The scooter works well
[2023-03-18T23:38:20] Mirko Boni: By setting 80A of battery and 180A of phase then a noise is heard in the motor..
[2023-03-18T23:39:11] Mirko Boni: But @KenLawrence says the difference is minimal.. üòîüòîüòî
[2023-03-18T23:39:46] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But, if it was different earlier, as said @jamessoderstrom then something happened ofc
[2023-03-18T23:39:59] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I thought you have both new motors with that Rs
[2023-03-18T23:40:36] Mirko Boni: But this change happened in 10 minutes.. First reading ok, next reading with this difference
[2023-03-18T23:42:33] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Probably vesc software
[2023-03-18T23:42:44] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Try manual tuning
[2023-03-18T23:43:27] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: And lower Zero vect freq to 5-10kHz then do foc detect and after return freq to 20-25+kHz

[2023-03-20T18:59:52] Mihail: Is it normal for a vesc to die if motor is stalled for 3 seconds at 90amps?
[2023-03-20T19:00:18] Mihail: I killed 2 75100s this way, vsett 10 motors
[2023-03-20T19:00:41] Mihail: I would guess its just shitsky issue
[2023-03-20T19:00:58] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-03-20T19:01:17] Mihail: Glad to hear
[2023-03-20T19:01:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: I pushed it much more harder
[2023-03-20T19:02:32] Mihail: With the motor stalled?
[2023-03-20T19:02:57] Mihail: I had no issues for a few month running at 120a phase/50 battery
[2023-03-20T19:03:21] Mihail: It died while holding brake and applying power
[2023-03-20T19:05:15] Mihail: My guess is the power was too much for a single mosfet to handle and it overheated. When motor is spinning and I accelerate hard it heats up pretty quickly
[2023-03-20T19:05:52] Mihail: And also there is no way it can dissipate heat fast enough to be measured by temp sensor
[2023-03-20T19:06:16] Mihail: I hope aluminum version doesnt have that issue
[2023-03-20T19:06:29] Mirono escooters: Given the size , cooling is hard
[2023-03-20T19:06:34] Mihail: Yes it is very bad, but I have non-alu version
[2023-03-20T19:06:44] Mirono escooters: Ppm mod its cooling then run more
[2023-03-20T19:06:47] Mirono escooters: Aly better
[2023-03-20T19:06:50] Mirono escooters: Way better
[2023-03-20T19:32:36] Gigolo Joe: 75100 v2 at 180 phase goes whooshhhh
[2023-03-20T19:33:16] Gigolo Joe: depends on what power you're pushing at low numbers it's ok
[2023-03-20T20:13:21] Mihail: Does it work well at 180 phase?
[2023-03-20T20:14:01] Gigolo Joe: Depends on motor and how many batt amps u run
[2023-03-20T20:25:44] Mihail: 70 batt amps max
[2023-03-20T20:26:15] Mihail: Vsett 10 motor

[2023-03-21T10:43:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well , that was not the best idea , without good cooling, for sure
[2023-03-21T10:43:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Was it in it's box?
[2023-03-21T10:44:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Unsure what you mean here, sensor Always measures
[2023-03-21T10:47:42] rosheee: need more fuckeria put d1ck in

[2023-03-21T10:54:35] rosheee: <video_file>
[2023-03-21T11:12:17] Mihail: Yes it was in box, but I dont think it matters for 3 second power peak
[2023-03-21T11:17:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well probably you had a trip before not just that moment so it was not cold before
[2023-03-21T11:17:11] Mihail: I mean the sensor measures the heatsink temperature, the mosfets get way hotter. The aluminum block behind the mosfets has some mass and cant heat up so quickly
[2023-03-21T11:17:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also that box just keeps heat
[2023-03-21T11:17:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You left it in the box so no point talking about itüòÖ
[2023-03-21T11:18:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Tiny. Piece of alu will do nothing in heatbridge business
[2023-03-21T11:18:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Bolt it down Always
[2023-03-21T11:24:51] Mihail: It wouldnt have helped, we are talking about 3s power on a mosfet attached with an insulator(kapton tape) to aluminum block. I may try removing the kapton tape with thermal pads to see if it helps. The same problem exists on the controller I made(based on 75100). It handled the torture for a bit longer, maybe 5 seconds, but still burned. I guess to220 package is not suitable for this much sustained switching current. Im sure toll8 will be better, I need it to be able to sustain this amount of torture for atleast 10-15 seconds, so that the temp sensor can react to the heat and reduce power.
[2023-03-21T11:33:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I use a lot of this never had similar problem at all ,either Customers One of them does 100 a and 120 phase more than an year now, he lives in hill area , 10 minute uphills killer uphills made it 70c ,also there is no such thing if ,it's build nice that temp sensor doesnt react if thermal throttle is set ,btw that also has a work range in% what can help you to avoid unwanted tempü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-03-21T11:33:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Sorry, me being bad burning flipsky üòÖ
[2023-03-21T12:22:13] Mihail: I also had no issues at 120a for a long time and no issues on hills, but never tested with the motor stalled. When stalled all the power goes to 2 fets instead of 6, so they dissipate 3x the heat they would normally do under full load.
[2023-03-21T12:24:08] Mihail: I know how fast temps rise under full load with no cooling, now imagine the same heat output ot 1/3 of mosfets
[2023-03-21T12:25:06] Mihail: The heat spreader can't go from 20¬∞ to 60¬∞ in 3 seconds
[2023-03-21T12:31:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: What you mean as stalled? Open loop?
[2023-03-21T13:01:08] Mihail: Motor not turning
[2023-03-21T13:01:30] Mihail: Mechanical brake pressed
[2023-03-21T13:02:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: Lol

[2023-03-21T13:37:47] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: stoopid
[2023-03-21T13:38:19] Mihail: I dont think it should burn even in such condition
[2023-03-21T13:38:58] Mihail: Ill check later if vesc software has something to detect motor stalled state and reduce power
[2023-03-21T13:48:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Because of fear ,ppl lot time do similar in accident situations ,you pull push all one time that's why having sensor is good
[2023-03-21T14:01:53] S1m 0n: Did you do this ? what did you use for the coating?
[2023-03-21T14:02:24] rosheee: We had then showed tronic
[2023-03-21T14:02:32] rosheee: XD now they coated all new ones
[2023-03-21T14:04:11] S1m 0n: do you use something like that?
[2023-03-21T14:05:11] S1m 0n: Good üòä
[2023-03-21T14:05:41] S1m 0n: Yes soon just wanted to double check it
[2023-03-21T14:06:33] S1m 0n: Just have to waiting for a UV Light
[2023-03-21T14:08:22] S1m 0n: yes if then everything will be done completely. with the uv light i feel safe to check it too and not have any holes in the seal.
[2023-03-21T14:29:45] Mirono escooters: Impossible. Motor always considered stalled, to start need oof
[2023-03-21T14:32:56] Mihail: Maybe lisp script to detect <5 erpm and reduce power to 10A for example
[2023-03-21T15:48:01] Mirono escooters: Eh, u want much power to start
[2023-03-21T15:48:56] Mihail: A small push is way over 5erpm, the motor will feel like normal
[2023-03-21T15:49:28] Mirono escooters: I don't push I start at standstill
[2023-03-21T15:50:57] Mihail: To test current output while at home, I updated vesc firmware and had issues with the input wizard and had to manually calibrate
[2023-03-21T15:52:25] Mihail: You must be moving atleast a little bit. Just the slight movement from stepping on the scooter is over 5 erpm
[2023-03-21T15:53:08] Mihail: It is not very comfortable getting on the scooter while it is not moving at all
[2023-03-21T15:53:39] Mihail: Yup, and I need more phase amps anyway
[2023-03-21T15:54:52] Mihail: Ill build my own, just collecting info about the performance of the aluminum 75100 because mine will be similar
[2023-03-21T15:55:08] Mihail: Yes
[2023-03-21T15:55:47] Mihail: <photos/photo_7982@21-03-2023_15-55-47.jpg>
[2023-03-21T15:57:13] Mihail: This is the first one I made but it has lots of issues since at the time I really didnt know what I was doing. Also it is 2 layers, it is impossible to make an esc with good signal integrity on 2 layers
[2023-03-21T15:57:56] Mihail: I got the pinout of the stm32 from the original creator of 75100, which flipsky stole
[2023-03-21T15:59:26] Mihail: They didnt bother making a config, they just copied the experimental firmware from his esc and told customers that it is not upgradeable
[2023-03-21T16:01:01] Mihail: For my new vesc Ill be using different 2*0.3mohm shunts so Ill have to make a custom config
[2023-03-21T16:02:56] Face de Pin Suc√©: It hasn't, we've faced same situation
[2023-03-21T16:03:21] Mihail: They literally had to just make a config and send it to Vedder to include in the project
[2023-03-21T16:04:04] Mihail: I also figured it is really expensive to make a good esc with lots of protection features
[2023-03-21T16:06:26] Mihail: <photos/photo_7983@21-03-2023_16-06-26.jpg>
[2023-03-21T16:08:46] Mihail: I also made this ecu board to control the lights, display, handle communication and translate vesc and bms commands to the original Xiaomi dashboard so I can use the bluetooth app. There is also an enable circuit which acts like the original xiaomi button and is completely customizable in software
[2023-03-21T16:09:47] Mihail: Dont mind the usb, it had an accident :)
[2023-03-21T16:11:22] Mihail: I plan to release this open hardware, but I can't until I present it for an university project
[2023-03-21T16:12:13] Mihail: Thanks
[2023-03-21T16:13:32] Mihail: Yes, I wrote software for that. There is also a low-pass filter and exponential map to smooth out the throttle.
[2023-03-21T16:14:12] Mihail: Implemented locking and made the cruise controll toggle in the xiaomi app enable zero-start
[2023-03-21T16:15:10] Mihail: It can also be enabled by pressing dash button 3 times
[2023-03-21T16:16:32] Mihail: <photos/photo_7984@21-03-2023_16-16-32.jpg>
[2023-03-21T16:17:23] Mihail: It also controls this additional screen to show me info like watts, distance, efficiency and such
[2023-03-21T16:18:55] Mihail: They can be ordered from a pcb manufacturer, it is a 4 layer pcb 50x41mm
[2023-03-21T16:22:58] Mihail: Here is the button functioning. It is currently responding very slow because the esc is dead and it waits for it while blocking main code, I should fix this
[2023-03-21T16:24:39] Mihail: It alternates between bms coloumb-counted percentage and vesc voltage-based percentage, since I like to see both. Since vesc is dead, it shows 0
[2023-03-21T16:25:32] Mihail: No just pcb. Parts must be sourced additionally
[2023-03-21T16:25:50] Mihail: If there is interest I can build a few
[2023-03-21T16:27:21] Mihail: It would be great if people can help with the code, since Im not very good at that.
[2023-03-21T16:37:02] Mihail: Theoretically a menu system can be made on screen to make it adjustable from the user and not needing to compile and flash everytime
[2023-03-21T16:47:32] Mirono escooters: Bike
[2023-03-21T16:48:54] Mihail: Oh that makes sense

[2023-03-21T23:37:40] Mirono escooters: Magura fits 3mm wide brake disk right
[2023-03-21T23:37:48] Mirono escooters: 2.3 Ain't stopping me
[2023-03-21T23:42:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, but disc will always touch pads
[2023-03-21T23:44:58] Mirono escooters: Sure?
[2023-03-21T23:45:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: At least mt5
[2023-03-21T23:45:15] Mirono escooters: Thought I remember 3mm
[2023-03-21T23:45:24] Mirono escooters: Idk what my current bike got
[2023-03-21T23:45:41] Mirono escooters: Is 2.3mm too thin ? For high power ebike
[2023-03-21T23:46:34] Mirono escooters: :/
[2023-03-21T23:46:55] Mirono escooters: Looks like all good brakes r 2.3mm
[2023-03-21T23:47:08] Mirono escooters: Except some china ones
[2023-03-21T23:47:16] Mirono escooters: Like one I got on bike
[2023-03-21T23:47:23] Mirono escooters: Think it 2.9
[2023-03-21T23:47:28] Mirono escooters: And it's close
[2023-03-21T23:47:40] Mirono escooters: But if no fit
[2023-03-21T23:47:52] Mirono escooters: I'm still not sure wich brake combo to use..
[2023-03-21T23:53:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Braking + 3mm disc
[2023-03-21T23:56:30] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I confirm. hope and 3.1mm already working
[2023-03-21T23:56:46] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: still has headroom a little
[2023-03-21T23:56:59] Mirono escooters: Sadly I stopped shitting money
[2023-03-21T23:57:25] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But, 3mm is already more than enough
[2023-03-22T00:03:17] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Our problem that we have small rotors (small diameters) and very big radial speed
[2023-03-22T00:03:33] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Hope itself working ok from 180mm atleast
[2023-03-22T00:04:50] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Heats very fast no matter what system using
[2023-03-22T00:05:27] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Can just reduce heat with wider rotors, a little bigger in diameter and good oil
[2023-03-22T00:06:33] Mirono escooters: I got 203mm on bike
[2023-03-22T00:06:43] Mirono escooters: Bigger no exist commercially
[2023-03-22T00:07:03] Mirono escooters: Oil? Heat?
[2023-03-22T00:07:34] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, on their table this is for heavy use, right
[2023-03-22T00:08:15] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Sorry, of course, the brake fluid will also heat up
[2023-03-22T00:09:19] Mirono escooters: Ahh yes
[2023-03-22T00:09:30] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: What is the strongest 100v to220 fet nowadays guys?
[2023-03-22T00:09:35] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: hsp0076a?
[2023-03-22T00:09:50] Mirono escooters: I saw china use small heatsink on oil connector lmao
[2023-03-22T00:10:04] Mirono escooters: Heatsinj on brake pad , useful?

[2023-03-22T00:16:21] Mirono escooters: Calipers always look well build but not levers.. looks like It would snap any time
[2023-03-22T00:20:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: No
[2023-03-22T00:20:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: But I think even better than magura lever üòÇ
[2023-03-22T00:22:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: More light
[2023-03-22T00:24:45] Mirono escooters: We don't need
[2023-03-22T00:24:55] Mirono escooters: We need robust badas
[2023-03-22T00:35:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: Lol, I think their main market isn‚Äôt us
[2023-03-22T00:35:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: They also made new crap SL disc with 20gr less than previous version that‚Äôs already crapüòÇ
[2023-03-22T01:31:04] rosheee: XD
[2023-03-22T06:00:23] Mihail: I think so, but still package limited to 120A

[2023-03-22T23:28:06] Elsass Rider: Thank you but how

[2023-03-22T23:58:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: No, I didn't shut down the scooter so it has this morning ride also
[2023-03-22T23:59:14] Face de Pin Suc√©: It uses information you enter inside SmartDisplay app

[2023-03-23T00:00:23] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes exactly
[2023-03-23T07:52:11] Elsass Rider: Hello everyone, I come to you looking for some help. this morning I turned on my scooter to go to work and when I got on it and wanted to leave, everything went out and never turned on again. I have a slight resistance on both motors. FYI, I was going to do my test in 22S. it worked perfectly in 16S. the vesc is given for a maximum voltage in 22S. Someone would have any idea ? Thank you
[2023-03-23T07:52:11] Elsass Rider: <photos/photo_7994@23-03-2023_07-52-11.jpg>
[2023-03-23T07:55:26] Mirono escooters: MOSFETs gone if motor has resistance
[2023-03-23T07:55:37] Mirono escooters: Or phase wires shorting
[2023-03-23T07:55:47] Mirono escooters: Did you ebrake on 22s
[2023-03-23T08:00:18] Elsass Rider: no ebrake it turned on correctly, by the time I put on the helmet I climbed on it I wanted to leave I barely accelerated until it was all off and there it no longer turns on. the phase cables are ok. is there any security on it?

[2023-03-23T09:12:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: What the hell
[2023-03-23T09:12:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: how
[2023-03-23T09:13:46] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: From what area are you? I get stopped so frequently, almost on weekly basis when I drive late and never got inspected. Did they see you speeding or what?
[2023-03-23T09:14:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: oh NRW
[2023-03-23T09:16:19] Face de Pin Suc√©: Dead mosfets ... Disconnect the battery but don't plug it in anymore, controller is probably short circuit
[2023-03-23T09:16:31] S1m 0n: In NRW they are hot, because the first time has new license plates. They stopped me because they wanted to check the licenses.a bull is then the Vsett display on the Mantis noticed... so it all started. Then I would also have 40g of grass in the bag ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2023-03-23T09:16:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Crazy, they noticed???
[2023-03-23T09:17:03] S1m 0n: Yes
[2023-03-23T09:17:16] S1m 0n: They also don't wanna make a test drive like in a past
[2023-03-23T09:17:46] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: FucküëÄ
[2023-03-23T09:18:24] S1m 0n: They only found the weed because I would be searched when I had to go to the station.
[2023-03-23T09:18:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: that's not good too üò¨
[2023-03-23T09:19:10] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: It's amazing how many stoners actually ride scootersüòÇ
[2023-03-23T09:20:12] S1m 0n: For grass at least 1000‚Ç¨ (is the second time on the escooter). If they can unlock the scooter, another 2-3000‚Ç¨. If they only complain about the display 15‚Ç¨ + administrative fees, so about 50‚Ç¨.
[2023-03-23T09:20:28] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: 40 grams a bit much will now be displayed as a small dealer? A buddy of mine had the problem with 10g
[2023-03-23T09:20:39] S1m 0n: Anyone who has never had a driver's license based on their consumption

[2023-03-23T09:20:57] S1m 0n: It's not a big problem
[2023-03-23T09:21:29] S1m 0n: Was caught several times is known that I am a long-term user. The scooter worries me more
[2023-03-23T09:21:45] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: :/
[2023-03-23T09:21:50] Mirono escooters: Lol they gonn cry bout display?
[2023-03-23T09:21:53] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: The on own consumption do not know I'm not better but fuck I'm very shocked xd
[2023-03-23T09:22:00] Mirono escooters: I hate controlling police so much
[2023-03-23T09:22:00] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes they do.
[2023-03-23T09:22:12] Mirono escooters: What a fucked up police state
[2023-03-23T09:22:22] S1m 0n: So true
[2023-03-23T09:22:42] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: just That they saw the difference or something is just sick do you have a radio remote control?
[2023-03-23T09:22:52] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Everything that is screwed on is a modification of the vehicle. So a phone holder would basically conflict with this too, but that's nothing they worry about (at least not in my area).
[2023-03-23T09:22:57] S1m 0n: Have not even done anything wrong and Werd still fucked
[2023-03-23T09:24:40] S1m 0n: Phone holders are less of a problem. But the display is an electronic component. Since I use a different display than the original, I am accused of tampering with the vehicle electronics. consequently, no insurance coverage.
[2023-03-23T09:24:47] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: a lot has been done to your iohawk, I'll tell you when they collect it, it's Game over I think so
[2023-03-23T09:25:25] S1m 0n: I also think do not need to give me much hope maxhen
[2023-03-23T09:25:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes I think so too.
[2023-03-23T09:26:15] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: sorry I'm from Saxony and here they are very, very relaxed, also because of the grass
[2023-03-23T09:26:27] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: When I build my G30 I will put so many fake labels on every fricking component etc üòÖ
[2023-03-23T09:26:39] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: in case it ever gets taken apart
[2023-03-23T09:26:58] S1m 0n: Let's hope that the silicone covered battery cover keeps them from opening the device. Then I would be on the safe side
[2023-03-23T09:29:34] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: and a colleague of mine with a Pro2 has already taken it and disassembled it and there are "guarantee" stickers and some other things where they can simply see that something has been done and if you You can only hope for a SubGhz Unlock tool because you don't know anything about that and the custom battery isn't really a problem either: your wiring and the LED
[2023-03-23T09:38:00] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: sry but it can also happen that you have to do MPU for a 20kmh fast scooter and then just as expensive as with a car, including a 6-month driving ban for scooters too, and then if you're unlucky, they randomly invite you over again at some point and make recidivism for that That's really a bad trap because weed won't be legalized until next year at the earliest
[2023-03-23T09:40:35] S1m 0n: No, mpu would not come until I register for a driver's license
[2023-03-23T09:41:15] S1m 0n: But it will be noted, that's for sure.
[2023-03-23T09:42:03] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: First Time?
[2023-03-23T09:42:29] S1m 0n: No, not first time. Second on scooter
[2023-03-23T09:42:56] S1m 0n: First time I have to pay 500‚Ç¨ (687 with tax). Second time will 1000‚Ç¨ + tax
[2023-03-23T09:43:26] S1m 0n: It's okay, I knew the day would come one day
[2023-03-23T09:44:05] Mirono escooters: Sad money
[2023-03-23T09:44:29] S1m 0n: Third time 1500
[2023-03-23T09:44:52] S1m 0n: Provided I get the scooter back
[2023-03-23T09:45:15] S1m 0n: After the 3rd time they could then confiscate the scooter for cannabis
[2023-03-23T09:45:35] Mirono escooters: Fuckers
[2023-03-23T09:45:52] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: the 2nd time my buddy had to MPU for 650‚Ç¨ and the 600 for possession and all
[2023-03-23T09:46:11] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: forever?üò±
[2023-03-23T09:47:35] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: I mean, you are my Iohawk role model, actually I hoped that you would one day be able to ride a Vesc on that thing and your scooter is just so awesomeüò≠üò≠
[2023-03-23T09:50:53] S1m 0n: Yes
[2023-03-23T09:50:53] S1m 0n: Same üò¢
[2023-03-23T09:52:04] S1m 0n: Drink and smoke is the same
[2023-03-23T09:52:30] S1m 0n: + the administrative costs. These are also sure to rise exponentially in our company.
[2023-03-23T09:57:47] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: what is it with you as a scooter driver üò∂

[2023-03-24T01:43:53] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: Ok, I got one of Paolo's wonderful engines a month ago, but not from Paolo himself, but by chance, I would say, and now I just want to know more about the engine to know maybe for more power because I have read here times subliminally a couple of things and I'm still relatively at the beginning of something I need to know morre I've also done small tests but I still don't quite understand them
[2023-03-24T01:44:26] rosheee: what u did?
[2023-03-24T01:44:41] rosheee: what's ur setup?
[2023-03-24T01:45:44] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: the 800w In a 500w Case that's awesome for Germany and 13s5p Ninebot g30d
[2023-03-24T01:46:21] rosheee: ok and esc?
[2023-03-24T01:46:56] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: pushing without Fw only mtpa and here we come to one thing, the 800w run much better with Mtpa
[2023-03-24T01:47:46] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: new Ubox she is just wonderful
[2023-03-24T01:48:15] rosheee: u did mtpa xD?
[2023-03-24T01:48:28] rosheee: what u set? tell more :D
[2023-03-24T01:48:32] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: jes not good?
[2023-03-24T01:48:37] rosheee: never tried ^^
[2023-03-24T01:48:41] rosheee: that's why asking
[2023-03-24T01:49:26] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: it's with Ortega Ob and bemf Dec
[2023-03-24T01:50:03] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: mtpa and Mx Lemming don't get along with the engine at all
[2023-03-24T01:50:08] rosheee: ok
[2023-03-24T01:50:16] rosheee: and then mtpa what? target?
[2023-03-24T01:50:27] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: jet
[2023-03-24T01:51:14] rosheee: why u choose MTPA?
[2023-03-24T01:52:14] rosheee: and what is your question :D?
[2023-03-24T01:54:33] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: I wanted to test it because I once saw Paolo write something about it and then googled it, you want to win the torque in the mtpa area before you exceed the field weakening so i had it turned on and tested i had a much faster acceleration and without mtpa it's only 47kmh gps at the same amps
[2023-03-24T01:55:02] rosheee: ok
[2023-03-24T01:56:28] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: but for me that would mean that the 800w blade has to be built more like an Ipm motor, which is why I wanted to ask why Paolo writes something like that and know moreü§î
[2023-03-24T01:56:48] rosheee: @PaoloWu de scam
[2023-03-24T01:58:14] rosheee: @marine_tugah FIRMWARES uploading

[2023-03-24T02:01:37] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: you're not the only one who tells me that but I'm not the only one with the engine üëÄ and I've read completely different things from other people here that don't even make sense to me
[2023-03-24T02:02:06] rosheee: so u just set target @ mtpa and that's it?

[2023-03-24T02:15:57] rosheee: hmm...o.O strange
[2023-03-24T02:17:01] rosheee: unplug everything and connect battery

[2023-03-24T02:27:42] Rogerio Figueiredo: To show the problem
[2023-03-24T02:28:12] Luis Magalhaes: The strager thing is why it work with low voltage and with higher it does not do anything
[2023-03-24T02:29:10] rosheee: when u connect without that Y?
[2023-03-24T02:29:14] rosheee: XD wtf
[2023-03-24T02:32:40] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yes
[2023-03-24T02:32:57] Rogerio Figueiredo: I just connect with y in video to be more easy to film it
[2023-03-24T02:36:50] rosheee: without Y it doesn't work as well
[2023-03-24T02:36:56] rosheee: since when?
[2023-03-24T02:38:25] rosheee: but looks like u can push much more amps ^^
[2023-03-24T02:38:27] rosheee: battery
[2023-03-24T02:38:29] rosheee: and phase
[2023-03-24T02:39:40] Rogerio Figueiredo: Never worked this is a brand new esc
[2023-03-24T02:40:06] rosheee: when u connect battery to other esc ^^?
[2023-03-24T02:40:22] Rogerio Figueiredo: Battery if fine yes
[2023-03-24T02:44:06] rosheee: then idk
[2023-03-24T02:44:15] rosheee: if u unplug everything and just connect battey ?
[2023-03-24T02:50:50] rosheee: nothing? @marine_tugah
[2023-03-24T02:51:04] Rogerio Figueiredo: Nothing
[2023-03-24T02:51:25] rosheee: ^^' maybe broken idk
[2023-03-24T02:51:31] rosheee: when u connect to it when 3S battery plugged in
[2023-03-24T02:52:01] rosheee: or when u use Y cable üòÜthen 1st connect 3S then the other battery?
[2023-03-24T02:53:22] Rogerio Figueiredo: I connect only 3s without the series cable and work
[2023-03-24T02:53:29] rosheee: yes
[2023-03-24T02:53:33] rosheee: and when u connect 1st 3S
[2023-03-24T02:53:33] Rogerio Figueiredo: The series cable is just to. Record
[2023-03-24T02:53:35] rosheee: and then the other one
[2023-03-24T02:53:44] Rogerio Figueiredo: Doesn't work
[2023-03-24T02:53:55] rosheee: then maybe ESC broken idk ^^'
[2023-03-24T02:54:07] Rogerio Figueiredo: Ya a it has to be
[2023-03-24T02:54:12] rosheee: ^^' flipsky
[2023-03-24T02:54:26] Rogerio Figueiredo: But with 3s works fine I even made a the motor the st no problem
[2023-03-24T02:54:49] Rogerio Figueiredo: Connect to pc
[2023-03-24T02:54:59] Rogerio Figueiredo: Tried like 10 diferent firmwares no. Luck
[2023-03-24T02:55:07] Rogerio Figueiredo: Worst this is makerbase
[2023-03-24T02:57:42] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It can be found on the vesc firmware repository: https://github.com/vedderb/vesc_fw_archive/tree/main/6.02%2F75_100_V2
[2023-03-24T02:59:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: ah yeah yeah, actual original stock can be found on the eks8 forum post which he dumped
[2023-03-24T03:00:12] rosheee: maybe it is his battery
[2023-03-24T03:00:25] Rogerio Figueiredo: I tried with stock firmware
[2023-03-24T03:00:31] Rogerio Figueiredo: Nothing change
[2023-03-24T03:00:35] rosheee: when battery fucked?
[2023-03-24T03:00:36] Rogerio Figueiredo: The battery is good
[2023-03-24T03:00:43] Rogerio Figueiredo: U can seed the voltage
[2023-03-24T03:00:45] rosheee: yes
[2023-03-24T03:00:54] Rogerio Figueiredo: See
[2023-03-24T03:00:57] rosheee: but when u test tomorrow with 16S
[2023-03-24T03:00:58] rosheee: and it works ^^
[2023-03-24T03:01:05] rosheee: + and - are correct xD?
[2023-03-24T03:01:20] Rogerio Figueiredo: Lool
[2023-03-24T03:01:25] Rogerio Figueiredo: Come on guys
[2023-03-24T03:01:33] rosheee: just asking
[2023-03-24T03:01:37] rosheee: when it works with your 16S tomorrow
[2023-03-24T03:01:38] rosheee: then ^^'
[2023-03-24T03:01:38] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @marine_tugah Not booting 75100 VESC? Yes I have one here myself, that someone gave to me, still need to look into it.
[2023-03-24T03:02:00] Rogerio Figueiredo: U needed to see my video
[2023-03-24T03:02:06] rosheee: it doesn't turn on
[2023-03-24T03:02:18] Rogerio Figueiredo: Boots and works just fine with 3s
[2023-03-24T03:02:37] Rogerio Figueiredo: More that that doesn't boot
[2023-03-24T03:02:38] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Oh ok ü§®
[2023-03-24T03:02:49] Rogerio Figueiredo: What is suitable voltage?
[2023-03-24T03:02:57] rosheee: will see tomorrow ^^' if works with 16S then lol@battery
[2023-03-24T03:03:02] Rogerio Figueiredo: With 3s I can completa. Setup. Motor test
[2023-03-24T03:03:15] Rogerio Figueiredo: Works just fine
[2023-03-24T03:03:27] rosheee: connect to 16S pls üòÜ
[2023-03-24T03:03:50] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Is it new? Sounds like flawed components.
[2023-03-24T03:03:55] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is the battery is outputing 49v it can't be the battery but tomorrow I make a test
[2023-03-24T03:04:01] Rogerio Figueiredo: Brand new makerbase
[2023-03-24T03:04:15] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I would Reeeeeturn and get new one.
[2023-03-24T03:04:26] Rogerio Figueiredo: The 15 gays pasted
[2023-03-24T03:04:27] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: free return on mks products anyway
[2023-03-24T03:04:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: oh
[2023-03-24T03:04:37] Rogerio Figueiredo: I have this like 2 months in the closet
[2023-03-24T03:04:47] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Well order another one send the broken one back
[2023-03-24T03:05:00] Rogerio Figueiredo: I think I will do that
[2023-03-24T03:06:31] rosheee: ^^
[2023-03-24T03:06:33] Rogerio Figueiredo: But is strange
[2023-03-24T03:06:42] rosheee: u know how it works ^^
[2023-03-24T03:06:43] Rogerio Figueiredo: With 3s works fine
[2023-03-24T03:06:47] Rogerio Figueiredo: Maybe dc dc
[2023-03-24T03:07:00] Rogerio Figueiredo: With 3s the 5v output
[2023-03-24T03:07:20] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is only outputing like 3,36v I don't know if is normal
[2023-03-24T03:09:39] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I still have to swap out the DC-DC on a old Flipsky 75100, which died too, with similar issue (but never tested 3s). And another Flipsky 75100 Alu PCB, that was gifted to me, which doesn't boot anymore, which is quite strange, but will try reflashing if possible and MCU hopefully not dead.
[2023-03-24T08:08:15] S1m 0n: Looks like I will get off with a black eye. Not the whole scooter is at issue, only the display. I had the Vsett display on it, but the IO Hawk version, where the illegal in Germany cruise control has been programmed out (the Vsett display is in the cabinet for testing purposes, with water damage). The display can still be problematic (forced to rebuild to the orginal), but technically seen, it is a gray area, since this display otherwise has a permit in Germany
[2023-03-24T08:10:11] S1m 0n: They also can't unlock the scooter without NFC üòÑ.. only if they know the Vsett bypass trick, but it's still in police mode
[2023-03-24T08:10:19] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: Omg sounds like exactly the gap you neededü•∫ü•∫
[2023-03-24T08:11:06] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: only need Credit Card lol
[2023-03-24T08:11:30] S1m 0n: That's just talk from a lawyer. Lawyers always talk everything up, but it also sounds conclusive to me.
[2023-03-24T08:13:36] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: Well he's not wrong there Look at your Iohawk But look at it and you can claim it's the same display protocol but it's not the only thing you've actually rebuilt ü§î
[2023-03-24T08:15:49] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: but it's pretty amazing with the knowledge of the Cops come you from K√∂ln?
[2023-03-24T08:19:15] S1m 0n: True, but externally everything is legal. Painting is not prohibited. The Zoom hydraulic brakes are not prohibited, IQ-Xe lamp has approval. The 1000W motor has 100W on it ü´£. Since there is no suspicion of a Speed slowdown, there is no reason to check the scooter on its performance ... You know how it is in Germany: they storm your apartment to confiscate your laptop / cell phone / storage media, because you ordered counterfeit money on the Internet, but must be the drugs on the table, because they had no search warrant for it üòÑ
[2023-03-24T08:20:00] S1m 0n: No d√ºsseldorf, or exactly in between near dormagen
[2023-03-24T08:35:36] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: 1. So a 100w motor would make me suspicious when you have stock 500wüòÇüòÇüòÇ 2.ok that somehow sounds like completely different police officersüòÇüòÇ
[2023-03-24T08:39:41] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: True I'll say I'm from the city with the largest Internet Shop for Drugs and knew the owner..üëÄ I don't know I keep myself deep underground on getting everything out of the way speed camera apps, black driving groups, police tracking groups everything
[2023-03-24T09:02:20] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yeah üî•
[2023-03-24T09:02:31] rosheee: Yeyeye
[2023-03-24T10:05:42] Jan: Lol
[2023-03-24T10:09:29] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: if I do a motor wizard setup and set max power loos what would you recommend I set?
[2023-03-24T11:30:23] Elsass Rider: hello everyone. I come to the community to seek advice. I just burnt out my VESC SPINTED after 2 months of use by switching to 22s. So I'm looking for a vesc that supports 22S. that of mechanical rage is not bad but for two price levels it makes me a little expensive. do you have any other models to recommend? thank you all.
[2023-03-24T11:37:07] sombre_enfant: Salut en vrai hors spintend et flipsky il y a rien bas budget sur √ßa, ou le c350
[2023-03-24T11:39:10] sombre_enfant: Imo 22s on vsett 10 motor isnt well cant push much amps
[2023-03-24T11:40:45] sombre_enfant: Maybe stay on 20s or 21s if u crazy and have more range of choice on small motor controller setup not worth to go super high voltage
[2023-03-24T11:41:40] sombre_enfant: He on 10+:)
[2023-03-24T11:43:23] sombre_enfant: Phase filter prob if he didnt up to v6.0
[2023-03-24T12:04:21] rosheee: Back on it
[2023-03-24T12:04:30] rosheee: With dem lower amps
[2023-03-24T12:22:10] Elsass Rider: the SPINTED in 20s works very well but in 22s I didn't even turn the wheel when the MOSFETs dropped
[2023-03-24T12:22:42] Elsass Rider: No
[2023-03-24T12:25:18] Elsass Rider: I wrote to them but it only takes 2 months in warranty and mine almost 3 months. he offered to send it back to them for free repair.

[2023-03-24T13:57:06] sombre_enfant: Is it ok to do ?
[2023-03-24T13:58:19] Mirono escooters: Wyy
[2023-03-24T14:23:30] sombre_enfant: Idk
[2023-03-24T16:21:11] rosheee: shuntmod?
[2023-03-24T16:50:36] sombre_enfant: No the connection are just direct to the phase like xiaomi and ninebot controller, i could bridge to shunt aswell
[2023-03-24T16:51:13] Mirono escooters: Naa why bridge shuntü•¥
[2023-03-24T17:04:39] rosheee: shunteria
[2023-03-24T17:06:12] sombre_enfant: I mean
[2023-03-24T17:09:28] Mirono escooters: Ahh
[2023-03-24T17:09:31] Mirono escooters: Eh won't do much
[2023-03-24T17:09:34] Mirono escooters: Multilayer copper pcb do more
[2023-03-24T17:10:08] rosheee: 250R has
[2023-03-24T17:10:09] rosheee: btw
[2023-03-24T17:10:18] rosheee: let's say
[2023-03-24T17:10:30] rosheee: is it safe push more battery amps and bit less phase ^^?
[2023-03-24T17:11:01] rosheee: like 2x200A battery and max 2x150-160A phase escs can do 2x300A max and 2x250A cont
[2023-03-24T17:11:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: Lol
[2023-03-24T17:11:40] rosheee: ^^
[2023-03-24T17:11:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: Phase can‚Äôt be higher than bat

[2023-03-24T17:14:14] rosheee: <video_file>
[2023-03-24T17:14:34] rosheee: why
[2023-03-24T17:14:41] rosheee: 150A battery per esc
[2023-03-24T17:14:46] rosheee: and 200A motor current
[2023-03-24T17:14:55] rosheee: phase would fuck mosfets?

[2023-03-24T17:17:38] rosheee: <sticker>
[2023-03-24T17:17:48] rosheee: but then can't push more amps than phase
[2023-03-24T17:17:57] rosheee: WHAT CAN HAPPEN WHEN BATTERY AMPS 2 HIGH?
[2023-03-24T17:17:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: At least flipsky don‚Äôt burn like TRONIC rofl

[2023-03-24T23:47:37] Face de Pin Suc√©: But less phase amps
[2023-03-24T23:53:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: It isn‚Äôt only 120A as they claim, 7212 peaks 200A also
[2023-03-24T23:53:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: Never saw but okay
[2023-03-25T00:51:23] S1m 0n: How do you regulate the boot time? It takes 45 seconds or longer until the dashboard is displayed @roscheeee ..
[2023-03-25T00:51:31] S1m 0n: and how long does the SmartDisplay need from booting to readiness?
[2023-03-25T00:59:13] S1m 0n: @koxx3 ‚Üë
[2023-03-25T02:05:41] Face de Pin Suc√©: 10s max
[2023-03-25T02:23:54] S1m 0n: Needs 1min35sec üò™
[2023-03-25T08:25:34] S1m 0n: No, the SD card is fine. Have only brands sd cards and more than Class 10 can not use the rpi
[2023-03-25T08:27:33] S1m 0n: The vesc display requires the desktop distro. I didn't realize that the vesc display only runs on top of an OS. Maybe I will try it later with a headless version, but I already know that he will complain then.
[2023-03-25T09:11:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: there is no realy 'boot' (as bios, grub, kernel and drivers load) on mcu. from power to main display, it's something like 1s. after, we wait for vesc CAN (~5s) and current sensing to init (it can add 2-3s, but can be disabled for faster start) ü§£
[2023-03-25T09:27:09] S1m 0n: Yes everything is coordinated and debloatedüëç
[2023-03-25T09:31:36] S1m 0n: The vesc GitHub display sucks. With a headless images it boots faster (still 20seconds or so), but can't boot the cans. Says has no access to the display. Same message you get when you try to install the display with the full image via ssh. I had hoped that the display is more like its own firmware (davega like), but it is more like an app.
[2023-03-25T09:58:48] S1m 0n: Maybe it's possible too but it's a long way to go. No nerf on it üò™
[2023-03-25T12:10:22] Tommy: <sticker>
[2023-03-25T15:28:49] rosheee: u boot the OS and then the SW
[2023-03-25T15:30:21] rosheee: yeh den code your own one ^^ ofc it takes long when it has to start an OS and then autostart the SW ^^ now you have the gear and now code urself üòä or buy 500euro display
[2023-03-25T15:32:55] rosheee: @koxx3 use 0 vesc code to access/read VESC CAN data?

[2023-03-25T16:13:42] rosheee: no le time
[2023-03-25T16:54:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope. when i started, i used some files like packet.h/c for vesc/uart, but it was too bloated. i ended up writing my own code.
[2023-03-25T17:42:23] S1m 0n: Are you planning some kind of lite version of the smartDisplay so that existing displays can be kept? Based on the smart controller or similar? You know all these protocols, Minimotor, Vsett, kaabo, Zero, vesc, Kelly.... This could be a game changer @koxx3
[2023-03-25T17:50:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: For now it is not planned
[2023-03-25T17:50:37] S1m 0n: The announced project with custom resulotion fails because of 3D printing parts? Printers can be found like sand more, you also have their groups like us
[2023-03-25T17:51:00] rosheee: ^^' i have a prusa that fails and gives me and prusa super headache
[2023-03-25T17:51:05] rosheee: ordered prusa xl now
[2023-03-25T17:51:17] S1m 0n: Why so stingy ? ü•≤
[2023-03-25T17:52:12] Face de Pin Suc√©: because now focus is on SmartDisplay and expansion boards
[2023-03-25T17:53:06] S1m 0n: 500‚Ç¨ Display will not all included? ü§Ø
[2023-03-25T17:54:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: At some point it is a dashboard, but it has a limited size
[2023-03-25T17:54:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: If we want to add extra features
[2023-03-25T17:54:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: BambuLab is actually lot much Suce
[2023-03-25T17:54:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: We have the possibility to create expansion boards
[2023-03-25T17:55:00] Face de Pin Suc√©: Light system for example is an expansion board, so you don't have all your light wiring going on top of hanlebar
[2023-03-25T17:55:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: Or speed modes for Kelly, because it needs a complete circuit design and don't have the space on the SmartDisplay PCB
[2023-03-25T17:55:46] Face de Pin Suc√©: Or we make a 9inch display
[2023-03-25T17:56:02] Face de Pin Suc√©: And we can play video games on it haha
[2023-03-25T17:58:46] S1m 0n: Too bad. Sounds more like a toy and multimedia tool, instead of a useful tool.
[2023-03-25T18:00:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: Same
[2023-03-25T18:03:40] Face de Pin Suc√©: You can call it a toy when it does : - Antitheft - Speed mode - Power mode - Police mode - Navigation - Temperature - Power - Clock (that keeps time even if not powered) - Tyre pressure - Throttle curve - Displaying speed of course - Music control - VESC Express (gateway to configure your VESC if you don't have USB or BLE) üôÇ
[2023-03-25T18:04:23] Face de Pin Suc√©: I certainly forgot functionnalities and @koxx3 will kill me, but anyway, I appreciate our toy
[2023-03-25T18:04:29] Face de Pin Suc√©: Wifi or BLE
[2023-03-25T18:06:24] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ü§£ü§£ü§£ not so much üòÅ
[2023-03-25T18:07:07] Face de Pin Suc√©: Hahaha I start to be good ü§†

[2023-03-25T18:07:29] Face de Pin Suc√©: Here a demonstration of how amazing it is to have a toy ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2023-03-25T18:42:14] Jan: Yeah bambulab looks like the revolution in the market but too small
[2023-03-25T19:05:05] S1m 0n: The development in all honor, but for a display on the phone you can also use the normal Vesc app. I am primarily concerned with the functionality to be able to communists with OEM devices that Koxx knows, knew however
[2023-03-25T19:08:47] S1m 0n: that would at least be a stepping stone to merge vesc and escooter, like the lisp for ninebot/xiaomi. i think few people want to spend 500‚Ç¨ for a display, regardless of what great features it offers. A larger community would also bring about more development, especially from the young people scene.
[2023-03-25T19:10:12] S1m 0n: it's not supposed to do Saint Samarita and do everything for nothing. but so n metr module ala smart controller would be great
[2023-03-25T19:10:21] S1m 0n: Just dreaming ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2023-03-25T19:54:56] Mirono escooters: Yes, defenitely. Universal adaptor would be so nice. And sell very well
[2023-03-25T21:26:46] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes but it is work, and for now, SmartDisplay is 100% time for koxx :)
[2023-03-26T01:07:08] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it was my first project (SmartController), and clearly, very few people were interested.

[2023-03-26T13:50:32] Face de Pin Suc√©: Bearings are okay so far
[2023-03-26T13:52:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes but free wheel test at such speed is not Suce for it
[2023-03-26T13:52:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: We‚Äôve small bearing because need to fit ebike discs
[2023-03-26T13:53:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: HM has more Suce bearing but can fit only shit disc
[2023-03-26T15:01:26] Jan: The 269kmh with that diameter is 5909rpm (88674erpm)

[2023-03-26T16:34:25] Mirono escooters: Omg
[2023-03-26T16:34:32] Face de Pin Suc√©: But you need perfect disc, I mean, disc perfectly turning well
[2023-03-26T16:34:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: Not doing waves
[2023-03-26T16:34:39] Mirono escooters: XD

[2023-03-26T16:37:06] Mirono escooters: Waterjet ok for rvs?
[2023-03-26T16:37:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: One of the biggest problem of dualtron is it has a shit brake support , is it good in your dualtron?
[2023-03-26T16:38:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: You mean on the side cover of motor ?
[2023-03-26T16:38:22] Face de Pin Suc√©: Or you mean on the arm ?

[2023-03-26T16:40:40] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes but it needs treatment to have a perfect surface
[2023-03-26T16:41:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: Normal, should to be rectified

[2023-03-26T16:58:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: Lol
[2023-03-26T17:37:49] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-03-26T17:37:53] Jan: üòÖ
[2023-03-26T17:37:56] Jan: üòÇüòÇ
[2023-03-26T17:49:08] Jan: Hmm to be honest, i really dont know how offsetting a handlebar is going to change the rotational axis. The axis is determined by the steering pole angle. Correct me if im wrong ü§∑
[2023-03-26T17:56:46] Jan: Then why would everyone put it in front of the steering axis?
[2023-03-26T17:58:20] Jan: Sounds like the virtual steering axis is projected from your hands to the wheel center
[2023-03-26T18:05:13] Jan: Would be nice
[2023-03-26T18:21:01] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yo This is a takeaway. As the stem length increases, the distance traveled by the center of the steering wheel also increases. With the same resistance of the steering wheel, you will need to spend more effort to grab the wheel (!) to move the steering wheel with a long stem. For this reason, a short stem handlebar is more responsive and responds to small bumps on the road. With a long stem, it will be more difficult for bumps to deflect the steering wheel to the side. The same applies to the length of the steering wheel in width. It will be more difficult for bumps to deflect wider handlebars (wider shoulder).
[2023-03-26T18:23:25] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yep
[2023-03-26T18:24:12] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Will be more stable and harder to destabilize steering
[2023-03-26T18:49:42] Mirono escooters: Are cooling on brake pads good? Or does little
[2023-03-26T18:52:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_8028@26-03-2023_18-52-26.jpg>

[2023-03-26T19:53:43] rosheee: received it finally :D
[2023-03-26T19:54:01] rosheee: he made 3
[2023-03-26T19:54:18] rosheee: if u not want @SibClimb i take the other 160mm for testing ^^ on gt2
[2023-03-26T19:55:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: ??
[2023-03-26T19:55:26] rosheee: he produced 3x 160mm x 3mm
[2023-03-26T19:55:30] rosheee: üòÉ
[2023-03-26T19:56:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: I only have 2 here
[2023-03-26T19:57:12] rosheee: i know
[2023-03-26T19:57:20] rosheee: brake stuff has the 3rd ^^
[2023-03-26T19:57:28] rosheee: he also made 3x 155mm
[2023-03-26T19:59:39] Face de Pin Suc√©: Oh I see
[2023-03-26T19:59:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: 155mm for you 10inch scooters ?

[2023-03-26T21:22:25] Mirono escooters: Nop
[2023-03-26T21:22:27] Mirono escooters: Just riding
[2023-03-26T21:22:51] Rogerio Figueiredo: Omg
[2023-03-26T21:38:03] sombre_enfant: Did he ever been ran over by a car ? He's fat ? How do he stand on scooter ?
[2023-03-26T21:42:33] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-03-26T22:11:57] Jason Nelson: Fatigue cracks are real, nothing lasts forever. Unless it is made of steel this will always happen, unless you treat it like a show piece
[2023-03-26T22:12:23] Jason Nelson: No modification?
[2023-03-26T22:12:48] Jason Nelson: Do you ride with him? What is his style?
[2023-03-26T22:16:38] Mirono escooters: I don't, but he's very conservative
[2023-03-26T22:16:49] Mirono escooters: 20a guy even if his batt is 40a (13s8p)
[2023-03-26T22:17:06] Mirono escooters: Long
[2023-03-26T22:20:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not true, with machined piece it will ‚Äúpre advise‚Äù you until it crack. That happen normally with casted or ‚Äúbadly‚Äù forged pieces .
[2023-03-26T22:21:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Much factors can affect it, like impurities, or air bubble
[2023-03-26T22:22:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt know but it isn‚Äôt machined
[2023-03-26T22:43:45] Jason Nelson: Ninebot uses extruded aluminum in the stem?
[2023-03-26T22:44:17] Mirko Boni: Perhaps the only solution at this point is the fixed pole
[2023-03-26T22:44:19] Jason Nelson: Snsc non flooding is steel
[2023-03-26T22:44:38] Jason Nelson: Folding
[2023-03-26T22:46:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: The cracked part isn‚Äôt stem, is the pipe going inside it, or ‚Äújoint‚Äù. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs it‚Äôs name

[2023-03-26T22:53:26] Federico77: What I notice this pin has been replaced, but I don't think it could have affected the breakage
[2023-03-26T22:55:16] Federico77: Instead where the blue arrow indicates you see dirt so I think the crack in the material was present for some time
[2023-03-26T22:59:07] Federico77: I want to say that the split material should have the same color, in the point indicated by the blue arrow and darker looks like dust perhaps it was cracked for some time
[2023-03-26T22:59:12] Mirko Boni: He means black.. You can tell it's an old split
[2023-03-26T23:01:03] Federico77: <photos/photo_8035@26-03-2023_23-01-03.jpg>

[2023-03-26T23:03:26] Simone: if it runs "dry" it is normal that it breaks ... they are balls that rotate on a ground track ... they overheat, wear out abnormally and make noise.

[2023-03-27T12:24:33] S1m 0n: Black is negative, white is positive, Lila is the signal coming from throttle

[2023-03-27T16:25:04] Martin Kaktits: i did try vsett10+ motor on xiaomi controller and cannot make it work
[2023-03-27T16:32:17] S1m 0n: Had put a xiaomi Hall pcb in the Mantis motor and tried to turn with the Vsett controller. Did not work either. Just as little as with regular 60 or 120¬∞ pcbs
[2023-03-27T16:33:07] Martin Kaktits: but if the hall pcb from known working motor.. then what slse is there? Magnnet spacing?
[2023-03-27T16:35:20] S1m 0n: The distance between the Hall sensors. If the distance is not correct, the signals come differently as the controller expects them (assumption).
[2023-03-27T16:37:56] Mirono escooters: But it's the same spacing since its in frame
[2023-03-27T16:38:00] Mirono escooters: Meant stator
[2023-03-27T16:39:51] Martin Kaktits: well.. the monorim pcb i tried did not fit perfectly... hmm
[2023-03-27T16:40:09] Martin Kaktits: <photos/photo_8037@27-03-2023_16-40-09.jpg>
[2023-03-27T16:40:24] Martin Kaktits: its close, but side ones little bent and not perpendicular
[2023-03-27T16:43:00] Martin Kaktits: but now im back to stock pcb, just replaced the single hall that was damaged. Still cant make it to work. Xiaodash even made 60degree mod and released it now in beta
[2023-03-27T16:43:04] S1m 0n: I had tested these. The big one should be from a Xiaomi, according to AliExpress description
[2023-03-27T16:43:23] Martin Kaktits: it says 120 here.. thats 120deg?
[2023-03-27T16:43:33] S1m 0n: Yes
[2023-03-27T16:44:04] S1m 0n: It's only, different the direction from middle hall
[2023-03-27T16:44:43] Martin Kaktits: then why it dont work i have no idea ü§Ø
[2023-03-27T16:49:27] S1m 0n: Why the Vsett one is red in the middle but 120¬∞ ?
[2023-03-27T16:50:00] S1m 0n: Is this cosmetic to cause confusion or maybe they installed two different hall sensors ?
[2023-03-27T16:50:43] Martin Kaktits: yes, mine is indeed red middle too and it doesnt help my co fusion üòÉ
[2023-03-27T16:51:20] S1m 0n: Fuckinell is not that simple as I expected
[2023-03-27T16:54:57] S1m 0n: Engine did turn with it, but sounded funny... and when I stood on it and tried to drive, it just went brrr brrrr brrrr
[2023-03-27T16:59:23] Martin Kaktits: ye this the closest it ever was to spinning in any configuration
[2023-03-27T16:59:23] Martin Kaktits: <video_file>

[2023-03-27T18:31:18] S1m 0n: Can I install flipsky next to my normal controller? That the speed of the orginalem controller is shown on the display and the scooter is controlled via flipsky? I was thinking of splitting the signal from the hall sensors in the engine..then the original controller can determine the speed ?!
[2023-03-27T18:32:40] S1m 0n: Would I need from the Hall sensors but only ground and connect the output and connected to the original controller?
[2023-03-27T18:33:58] Mirono escooters: Sure
[2023-03-27T18:34:07] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-03-27T18:34:11] Mirono escooters: Should work
[2023-03-27T18:34:34] Mirono escooters: Yes

[2023-03-27T18:35:35] S1m 0n: Since the original controller then no longer has power to edit, I could also simply pack the pcb in shrink wrap to save space
[2023-03-27T18:36:16] S1m 0n: I think that the speed is determined by the hallsenoren because even if the phases are disconnected the display shows the speed when pushing
[2023-03-27T18:36:17] Mirono escooters: Eh depends quality and controller
[2023-03-27T18:36:28] Mirono escooters: Yes those controllers almost always do it like dat
[2023-03-27T18:36:38] Mirono escooters: Speed also need less accuracy then driving motor for exampl
[2023-03-27T18:36:57] S1m 0n: Originale IO Hawk Controller works different. He have a extra hall in it for speed like ebikes
[2023-03-27T18:37:13] Mirono escooters: In ebikes it's a backup hall sensor
[2023-03-27T18:37:18] Mirono escooters: Because opening and repair sucks so much
[2023-03-27T18:37:39] S1m 0n: No no, some ebikes have a extra for speed signal
[2023-03-27T18:37:57] Mirono escooters: Thats just 1 magnet tho
[2023-03-27T18:38:02] Mirono escooters: Not (multiple) halls
[2023-03-27T18:39:41] S1m 0n: Not multiple, just one extra
[2023-03-27T18:40:03] S1m 0n: <photos/photo_8044@27-03-2023_18-40-03.jpg>
[2023-03-27T18:40:40] S1m 0n: This is on original IO Hawk the speed signal
[2023-03-27T18:41:28] S1m 0n: baFang motors also have this speed signal
[2023-03-27T18:42:45] S1m 0n: U can check, whenever the Hall Connector have 6 Pins inside, than it's with SpeedSignal
[2023-03-27T18:45:15] S1m 0n: I do not know. But if you manipulate the signal (about half), you can make the motor run faster by doing this
[2023-03-27T18:54:22] Jason Nelson: Other than stop buying flipsky, does anybody know what the unbalanced current error means?
[2023-03-27T18:54:51] Jason Nelson: Sweet
[2023-03-27T18:55:27] Jason Nelson: I'll look when I get home
[2023-03-27T19:05:29] Mirono escooters: Yh guessed so
[2023-03-27T19:05:40] Mirono escooters: Or temp sensor
[2023-03-27T19:06:04] Mirono escooters: Real or display xD
[2023-03-27T19:07:18] S1m 0n: For real. By letting only every 2nd signal through.
[2023-03-27T19:07:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Thats usually 5 only
[2023-03-27T19:08:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Power and ground is already there i mean
[2023-03-27T19:08:36] S1m 0n: Yes Power, Ground + 3 Halloutput
[2023-03-27T19:09:18] Mirono escooters: Uh, 3 halls, sensor, gnd, +
[2023-03-27T19:09:22] Mirono escooters: I count 6
[2023-03-27T19:10:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And you are right ü§£ , i mixed a line in my head
[2023-03-27T19:11:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: It was obvius afterwards ü§£
[2023-03-27T19:11:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: but it cannot be saved
[2023-03-28T02:52:16] Jason Nelson: Red light means it's experiencing a fault error from what I understand
[2023-03-28T03:54:34] Jason Nelson: What do your motor detection details look like?
[2023-03-28T03:56:47] Jason Nelson: <photos/photo_8045@28-03-2023_03-56-47.jpg>
[2023-03-28T03:56:59] Jason Nelson: While the red light is flashing it should throw your error message right here
[2023-03-28T03:57:37] Jason Nelson: There is also a log accessible from somewhere as I understand
[2023-03-28T08:17:21] Thierry: You can type "faults" in terminal to see if there is errors since last startup
[2023-03-28T08:18:42] Thierry: Maybe wrong voltage setting so over voltage error?
[2023-03-28T09:31:44] Mirono escooters: You check errors in VEsc
[2023-03-28T11:34:13] Ofek üê•: Change max voltage +5V higher than the battery fully charged
[2023-03-28T12:33:37] Basti: Is this idea to work io hawk legend display but motor runs with vesc ?
[2023-03-28T12:51:30] Basti: Third Person from Germany 4200km , Mironos pics are 10.000km Dont know How much james has driven
[2023-03-28T12:52:53] Mirono escooters: All Germany
[2023-03-28T12:57:09] S1m 0n: Yes could be a botched solution :)
[2023-03-28T13:05:02] S1m 0n: So this refers to the 1k kit aka original Mantis 10. The original IO Hawk controller needs n tacho signal from the motor. The motor is a gear motor, which you do not want to operate with Vesc. So you can't connect the original IO Hawk motor to Vesc and you can't connect a motor without a tacho signal to the IO Hawk controller. The legacy looks different, but the motor is supposed to be really bad, so you probably need a different motor.
[2023-03-28T13:06:28] rosheee: Never had that problem
[2023-03-28T13:06:36] rosheee: Maybe ppl use srem wrong
[2023-03-28T13:06:54] S1m 0n: As far as the Legend is concerned, nothing needs to be connected to the controller, like the hall sensors from the engine and the signal from the throttle... the controller is not interested in whether lights, brakes or phases are connected...
[2023-03-28T13:29:25] Basti: Yeah So if that works, I'll definitely come to you dtown, I've almost sold my Ninebot... now we'll continue with legacy
[2023-03-28T14:25:38] S1m 0n: Too many sidewalks up and down, I am sure üòÑ
[2023-03-28T14:27:54] Mirono escooters: I thought too
[2023-03-28T14:27:59] Mirono escooters: Non folding for W
[2023-03-28T16:07:33] T·ëå·ñá·ó∑O·îï·ó©·îï·ëï·ïº: I orderd one from him too
[2023-03-28T16:37:52] Ion: Hi, I plan on getting a VESC for my 10+. Quick question: if I get a UBOX and metr module for telemetry, do I need the UBOX Bluetooth module also? Thanks
[2023-03-28T17:07:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Metr?
[2023-03-28T17:07:49] Ion: metr https://metr.at/
[2023-03-28T17:13:11] Ion: Are you still selling it?
[2023-03-28T17:14:29] Ion: Where are you located and how much?
[2023-03-28T17:20:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well there tldr tells you need there bt module ,but they dont tell too much ,while i dont really understand why that's good
[2023-03-28T17:20:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: It looks,it tells basic infos what mostly all vesc tells
[2023-03-28T17:23:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Maybe some has experience with this metr , for me looks kinda good for nothing
[2023-03-28T17:29:13] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I wish their CAN module would not be out of stock...
[2023-03-28T17:29:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yeah also all is out of stock
[2023-03-28T17:32:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So if you dont want there fancy app for some reason, you dont need 50 euro bt module
[2023-03-28T17:37:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You know it?
[2023-03-28T17:47:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also interesting that Austrian site and Swedish currency and address ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-03-28T17:49:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: <photos/photo_8047@28-03-2023_17-49-02.jpg>
[2023-03-28T17:50:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also expert mode kills me , what's expert in that? All based on vesc stuff ,just gives it an another app with much less features in config, am i wrong?
[2023-03-28T17:53:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yeah the app is awful, only thing I like is the usage via CAN + PIN-Code and the support of LTT BMS.
[2023-03-28T17:53:31] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But seems it's not possible to connect via VESC app directly
[2023-03-28T17:56:39] Mirono escooters: Ieuw
[2023-03-28T17:56:47] Mirono escooters: Oh cool Llt support
[2023-03-28T18:38:35] S1m 0n: Davega display also have LLT support
[2023-03-28T18:47:10] pinkflozd: You can connect to vesc tool with metr
[2023-03-28T18:47:47] pinkflozd: i like the logging feature on metr, but for settings i use vesc tool with metr
[2023-03-28T18:47:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It can? That's good.
[2023-03-28T18:48:03] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes also good
[2023-03-28T18:48:44] pinkflozd: i just need to unplug it once a month from my always on vesc, not sure why but after a long time it hangs
[2023-03-28T21:59:23] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you're too used to chinese products üòÖ
[2023-03-28T22:05:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: in european/western countries, experienced engineering work is at ~800‚Ç¨ per day (usual cost on any IT project). if anybody wants to have a minimal invest return on his work, how do you want people to invest time on such project and listen to users if they are less paid than any other jobs. hard job against chineese
[2023-03-28T22:56:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: Happy to made it work mate üòä
[2023-03-28T23:13:32] Mirono escooters: 800‚Ç¨???
[2023-03-28T23:32:14] Rogerio Figueiredo: There will be caching fire
[2023-03-29T00:36:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, this is the daily fees for the experienced people in tech industries.
[2023-03-29T01:51:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Bro basically look at his module, that no eu made üòè So his work added ,but still pointless to buy that , Pls just Tell what you cant do, irl without itü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-03-29T01:55:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Mostly all offered stuff based on vesc ,just in a different look what reminds me off "reduced mode" For me surly a no go
[2023-03-29T11:28:39] Mirono escooters: üò∂ I choose the wrong study degree
[2023-03-29T11:43:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think the is right to charge engineering fee to the final price, but you have to think to sell it at large scale, charge less fees but sell more, you will get back anyway time cost , but you will get more customers and make happy more people. That‚Äôs just my opinion
[2023-03-29T12:08:03] Mirono escooters: Me?
[2023-03-29T21:10:36] Mirono escooters: Ordered mdr-p 220/203 ü§†
[2023-03-29T21:38:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: That box not ment to bridge heat, so look out for temps
[2023-03-29T21:46:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: Show us the temps with controller is this way
[2023-03-29T23:12:24] S1m 0n: What is ur setting?
[2023-03-29T23:26:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Worst cooling idea

[2023-03-30T01:20:53] Mirko Boni: but do saint's handle 3 mm?
[2023-03-30T01:21:49] Face de Pin Suc√©: I used Saints with 3mm discs, but you need perfect surface for your discs, not doing any waves or it will *cling cling cling*
[2023-03-30T01:23:13] Mirko Boni: OMG... I hate cling cling
[2023-03-30T01:27:49] Mirono escooters: XD me too
[2023-03-30T01:30:56] Mirko Boni: however my brake stuff braking bent slightly
[2023-03-30T01:35:06] rosheee: ?? how
[2023-03-30T01:38:48] Mirko Boni: yes yes... in the G30 dual motor the front brake disc is slightly crooked... whereas before it was perfect
[2023-03-30T01:57:41] Simone: How much?
[2023-03-30T02:01:40] Mirko Boni: They are very beautiful, right Simone?
[2023-03-30T02:14:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: For the Hope?
[2023-03-30T05:34:04] Simone: I would like to try a 3mm disc done right ... let's see how it behaves

[2023-03-30T09:55:49] Jan: Brakestuff No.1 Trickstuff No.2 Rest No.3+ @SibClimb how would you rate the different calipers
[2023-03-30T10:04:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: True ,sometimes Best is , to do nothing ,when you are like this, that way he makes no damage. And this i say without hate
[2023-03-30T10:05:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But there is more, whole battery in that, is soldered not spot welded
[2023-03-30T10:09:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: For me it's too purple üòÅ Also brake so shiny that reminds me of Inokim bitch
[2023-03-30T10:10:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Inokim bitch
[2023-03-30T10:10:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Just to get it
[2023-03-30T10:18:43] Jan: Color can always be changed
[2023-03-30T10:28:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Brake's also ,even more easy

[2023-03-30T12:12:09] Mirono escooters: Correct fw
[2023-03-30T12:14:45] Rogerio Figueiredo: What is correct fw?
[2023-03-30T12:14:53] Rogerio Figueiredo: The old 5.2?
[2023-03-30T13:15:34] Simone: I need for magura
[2023-03-30T14:18:30] Jan: Magura is complete ass quality
[2023-03-30T14:18:47] Jan: Will never buy again
[2023-03-30T14:19:02] Mirono escooters: üò∂ why
[2023-03-30T14:31:50] Jan: Too short for me
[2023-03-30T14:32:05] Jan: Example the saint were like 2cm lever
[2023-03-30T14:32:27] Mirono escooters: Fuck
[2023-03-30T14:32:32] Mirono escooters: Who doesn't
[2023-03-30T14:32:51] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-03-30T14:33:06] Jan: Complete ass quality for what you pay. They mark it under "light weight" so they can piss poor injection mold everything in one piece to save cost
[2023-03-30T14:34:25] Jan: Yeah probably but my next would require a brake sensor as well
[2023-03-30T14:38:18] sombre_enfant: Its for dh user or all mountain or xc so need more finger for speed shifter and handlebar control
[2023-03-30T14:39:27] Jan: Yeah in my project i will need an e brake sensor additional to the spin y
[2023-03-30T14:39:56] Jan: And i need the new spin y but @artBula is still figuring out a plan with the v1 customers
[2023-03-30T14:40:20] Jan: You have an aliexpress link?
[2023-03-30T14:40:40] Jan: üòÉ
[2023-03-30T14:42:59] Mirono escooters: Wow
[2023-03-30T14:46:14] Jan: I like this idea, thanks alot
[2023-03-30T15:05:47] Face de Pin Suc√©: Ah sorry I didn't understand
[2023-03-30T15:07:31] sombre_enfant: 0-4.2 progressive or just 0-1 ?

[2023-03-30T15:59:16] S√©bastien Michon: Hi, actually i have a classic 15s AWD 350W with Xiaomi ESC. What is the better solution to put vesc ? Flipsky, other ? What Can i do for thermals ? Do you have some Idea please üôèüèª
[2023-03-30T16:13:49] Jan: "better" is very subjective. I can recommend you some 500$+ controller which are for sure better in performance
[2023-03-30T16:14:28] Jan: Maybe price to performance ratio or just budget option are better, depends on you
[2023-03-30T16:16:18] Mirono escooters: Flipsky alu pcb
[2023-03-30T17:35:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Playing RS?
[2023-03-30T17:36:24] sombre_enfant: Thats first flipsky 75100 true 16s they got better now, first batch of true 75100 was dying because people didnt knew phase filter issue now its all good if u can cool it
[2023-03-30T17:41:44] S1m 0n: my colleague had Flipsky Alu. stayed nice and cool with 20S, but broke anyway. he currently has my flipsky non alu and says that with 20s/20a he already warms up to around 45¬∞ (currently we have ‚âà12¬∞c outside
[2023-03-30T17:50:07] sombre_enfant: Need to know well what u setup and how it affect and supply it. U cant repair if u fail
[2023-03-30T17:52:28] sombre_enfant: 16s 50A + 40A fw i was at 60deg on log for 20km run in 30-35min It was dual stock heatsink screwed to inox so not that bad battery overheat way more
[2023-03-30T17:58:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Basically,what is your goal?
[2023-03-30T18:00:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If you stay with does small engine's kinda no point to upgrade to vesc, i think
[2023-03-30T20:44:00] S√©bastien Michon: How do you position the 2? one eatch the other ?
[2023-03-30T20:44:23] Rogerio Figueiredo: Fak
[2023-03-30T20:47:25] Rogerio Figueiredo: ?
[2023-03-30T20:53:46] S√©bastien Michon: Yes 16s are good for me but i don't know where could i put it. 75100 without box are thin but 75100 alu are better
[2023-03-31T00:18:39] Face de Pin Suc√©: Brakestuff 3mm + Hope Tech4 V4, most powerful braking ever tested
[2023-03-31T00:24:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: What about Ken 3mm disc?
[2023-03-31T00:26:18] Face de Pin Suc√©: How do you know I already have ? üòÅ
[2023-03-31T00:26:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: He sent me for testing, I test this week-end
[2023-03-31T00:28:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because I know you lover of 3mm disc, then anything different than Kaabo one you will likeüòÇ
[2023-03-31T01:01:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Damn, bird ate cableüòÅ
[2023-03-31T07:25:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: Hahahaha
[2023-03-31T10:45:11] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is there any patch for firmware 6.0 and Flipsky to read right battery?
[2023-03-31T15:18:41] rosheee: Think thr brake stuff is proper
[2023-03-31T15:19:33] rosheee: XD
[2023-03-31T15:21:31] rosheee: 20A xD?!?!
[2023-03-31T15:24:34] rosheee: HFI very suc√©
[2023-03-31T16:55:01] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is very hard to adjust
[2023-03-31T16:56:05] rosheee: idk if my settings good but so far all very stable and ^^ veryboost..sad i have no fuckeria 16s battery to test
[2023-03-31T16:59:29] rosheee: 180A cont. 60A bms not like
[2023-03-31T17:46:10] S1m 0n: He is currently back on 13s and g30d controller. Flipsky Alu broken... my Flipsky non alu was broken yesterday with 20S (no response, no LEDs nothing), today with 13s the controller suddenly works again... my colleague has still a lot to test until he has found his way
[2023-03-31T17:51:34] S1m 0n: Next week he gets flipsky 75200 aluminum, then the tests continue
[2023-03-31T17:55:34] rosheee: XD

[2023-03-31T20:34:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: This more thick,right?
[2023-03-31T20:35:18] Mirono escooters: How thick?
[2023-03-31T20:35:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I think 3 they said
[2023-03-31T20:36:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: 3mm
[2023-03-31T20:37:03] Mirono escooters: Price? Problably no 203mm?
[2023-03-31T20:37:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Basically thicker better Always
[2023-03-31T20:37:23] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse
[2023-03-31T20:37:27] Mirono escooters: üò´üò≥
[2023-03-31T20:37:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I mean coz of heat ,whole is different
[2023-03-31T20:38:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: 160mm haha
[2023-03-31T20:38:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: RS would need that also regarding speeds
[2023-03-31T20:38:37] Face de Pin Suc√©: They announced 44‚Ç¨/disx
[2023-03-31T20:39:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: That's a good price
[2023-03-31T20:40:08] Mirono escooters: Yes sadly I need 203
[2023-03-31T20:55:53] Jason Nelson: I upgraded to the aluminum base 75100 and after the installation I keep getting this message
[2023-03-31T20:55:57] Jason Nelson: <photos/photo_8053@31-03-2023_20-55-57.jpg>
[2023-03-31T20:56:16] Mirono escooters: Rx tx swapped?
[2023-03-31T20:56:18] Mirono escooters: Bluetooth?
[2023-03-31T20:56:25] Jason Nelson: I switched the wires on Bluetooth already
[2023-03-31T20:56:42] Jason Nelson: Hold on
[2023-03-31T20:57:23] Jason Nelson: I had it in the wrong port
[2023-03-31T20:59:01] Jason Nelson: Came with 75300 fw
[2023-03-31T22:37:26] S1m 0n: Something is going wrong here. Bronze vs Iglidur plain bearings ... And for that you pay 20‚Ç¨ shipping from Spain
[2023-03-31T22:37:27] S1m 0n: <video_file>
[2023-03-31T22:41:01] S1m 0n: Old/orginal ones
[2023-04-01T07:11:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well, it's nice that they exist ,but also industrial plastic can be fucked up ,so as bronze or copper one. And kinda it's ment to be like thatüòÑ
[2023-04-01T09:45:05] Mirono escooters: Not bearings, bushings?
[2023-04-01T10:25:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: We name it Bearings also in my language, but this special plastic is better
[2023-04-01T10:27:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: All These are gap fillers in a way ,so its normal if they fail after a while and instead the other grind and not get stuck like the other
[2023-04-01T10:28:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like monorims rear suspension misses this from the body side and moves a mm or so when you get it
[2023-04-01T11:21:42] Mirono escooters: Nylon
[2023-04-01T11:22:36] Mirono escooters: Bearing are something else
[2023-04-01T11:22:40] Mirono escooters: :)
[2023-04-01T11:24:23] Mirono escooters: No, bushings are just low level bearings kinda
[2023-04-01T11:24:46] Mirono escooters: Less maintenance, cheaper, but it got limited stress and heat it can take
[2023-04-01T11:24:52] Mirono escooters: Fine for suspension and or steering collumn
[2023-04-01T11:31:20] S1m 0n: I like the iglidur bearings. They are nice and smooth..however, I had used some the weekend before he was then with the police. That was 2 weeks ago now and I didn't drive much. Nevertheless, I could already see clear deformations yesterday
[2023-04-01T11:38:14] Mirono escooters: We call it bearings too. Slide bearings "Glij lagers" And lagers r bearings
[2023-04-01T15:02:37] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_8056@01-04-2023_15-02-37.jpg>
[2023-04-01T15:02:48] Mirono escooters: @roscheeee xD U used 80v/100a?
[2023-04-01T15:04:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I know what you mean by the look but still named like he called it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-04-01T15:05:05] Mirono escooters: Huh? Bushings
[2023-04-01T15:05:20] Mirono escooters: Its a English name
[2023-04-01T15:05:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Read rest afterwards
[2023-04-01T15:06:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yeah you can call it like that also , did not say you are wrong
[2023-04-01T15:06:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Mr huh
[2023-04-01T15:06:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: ü§£
[2023-04-01T15:07:16] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-04-01T15:07:50] Mirono escooters: I mean. It does the same as a bearing..
[2023-04-01T15:08:03] Mirono escooters: But if you ask for a bearing you get from me with balls, and bushings is without Google too
[2023-04-01T15:08:08] Mirono escooters: But yes both right
[2023-04-01T16:21:00] Jason Nelson: Any criticisms for running hfi?
[2023-04-01T17:44:59] Mirono escooters: Ah thought they used him as advert xD

[2023-04-02T09:23:47] Face de Pin Suc√©: Instagram maybe?
[2023-04-02T10:10:19] Mirono escooters: I wonder how are the regulations? What is limited? Or whatever max you can push?
[2023-04-02T10:13:27] Thierry: I think only the weight, there is two categories: <=25kg and >25kg.
[2023-04-02T13:59:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I have that
[2023-04-02T13:59:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Small turns
[2023-04-02T22:13:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes exactly
[2023-04-02T22:14:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: Very small track
[2023-04-02T22:14:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: But we had a lot of fun
[2023-04-03T08:25:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: That's good
[2023-04-03T08:26:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: On asphalt when road is flat and wide lot small turns not so lovely
[2023-04-03T08:33:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I use to ride similar lot turn path's ,but does are different. Turns are similar but whole is bike lane wide and its forest dirt road So basically whole is slower speed ,like max 40 But you see nothing from tree's and bushes just after a turn, so it's fun if some ppl walks your way
[2023-04-03T08:33:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So use to play loud music ,to heard ü§£
[2023-04-03T08:37:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Terrain changes all time, coz this a Forest/ swamp area So outer roads are dryer, more dust As you enter more hard roads, than Inside is bit softer and kinda wet No mud Basically it's even fun coz tire even grips more there . But basically i use offroad tire scooter for this fun
[2023-04-03T08:39:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I have a go kart track near me , half open, Half closed one Like 1km far but i dont use at all
[2023-04-03T08:40:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: There is a closed road behind it what i use ,coz it's a dead end made for only when constructions was there, now unused , so basically 2 km road 6 m wide just for testing
[2023-04-03T08:43:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also there is Another better who we know owners even ,but community not that grown to have similar
[2023-04-03T08:45:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Nice that you have such community life that things like that exists, here lot ppl with bigger scooters are kinda assholes ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ

[2023-04-03T20:01:54] Oreo huzky: Absolute max current 450
[2023-04-03T20:02:14] Konstantin: Blow up?
[2023-04-03T20:02:25] Oreo huzky: Yea
[2023-04-03T20:02:39] Oreo huzky: At 70kmh that wasn‚Äôt comfortable
[2023-04-03T20:02:53] Oreo huzky: And the walk home was terrible because both motors locked up
[2023-04-03T20:02:57] Konstantin: Fets? Now much battery S?
[2023-04-03T20:03:07] Oreo huzky: 20s
[2023-04-03T20:03:16] Oreo huzky: I guess
[2023-04-03T20:05:07] Mirono escooters: If motors permanently short, most likely fets If motor loosens when phase wires disconnected, fets
[2023-04-03T20:05:07] Mirono escooters: Were you ebraking?
[2023-04-03T20:05:42] Oreo huzky: Yes
[2023-04-03T20:06:07] Oreo huzky: Motor Losens after phase wire disconnect
[2023-04-03T20:06:34] Oreo huzky: But the acceleration was nice
[2023-04-03T20:09:26] Mirono escooters: Rip
[2023-04-03T20:09:31] Mirono escooters: Makerbase ain't the best idea then
[2023-04-03T20:10:10] Oreo huzky: Is there a better alternative that costs around 180 per controller
[2023-04-03T20:13:20] Oreo huzky: 320
[2023-04-03T20:13:32] Oreo huzky: And 30A fieldweakening
[2023-04-03T20:15:05] Oreo huzky: And it didn‚Äôt overheat at all it stayed at 37 degrees
[2023-04-03T20:15:17] Oreo huzky: That seems very strange to me
[2023-04-03T20:24:43] sombre_enfant: What motor u use to feed 330A?
[2023-04-03T20:26:14] Oreo huzky: 8000W Motor
[2023-04-03T20:26:32] Oreo huzky: I don‚Äôt know can I check
[2023-04-03T20:26:44] sombre_enfant: Show
[2023-04-03T20:26:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs for both motor or single?
[2023-04-03T20:27:13] Gigolo Joe: It's pretty easy to feed that much phase amps, problem starts when very high battery current joins the chat
[2023-04-03T20:28:06] sombre_enfant: 330 phase with low battery current is non sense...
[2023-04-03T20:28:28] sombre_enfant: Same as 8000w motor... Just tell winding magnet etc...
[2023-04-03T20:28:50] Mirono escooters: For 1 second xD
[2023-04-03T20:29:03] Oreo huzky: Single

[2023-04-03T20:29:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: If it‚Äôs single motor, the motor would burn first
[2023-04-03T20:29:49] Oreo huzky: Battery current was set to 150A
[2023-04-03T20:29:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: So your esc died because of motor
[2023-04-03T20:30:07] Oreo huzky: Hm how

[2023-04-03T20:30:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes 8000w market rebrand
[2023-04-03T20:31:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Factory official data is 2300w
[2023-04-03T20:31:02] Oreo huzky: <photos/photo_8063@03-04-2023_20-31-02.jpg>
[2023-04-03T20:31:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: You know right that label don‚Äôt mean nothing?
[2023-04-03T20:31:34] Oreo huzky: The official manufacturer also states 8000W
[2023-04-03T20:32:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: We cooperate with this factory much earlier than you
[2023-04-03T20:32:36] Oreo huzky: Hm?
[2023-04-03T20:32:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: @SibClimb can confirm
[2023-04-03T20:32:59] Oreo huzky: So they basically sold me a 2300W motor for 450‚Ç¨
[2023-04-03T20:33:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: Just see the stator, is half size of Ly motorüòÇüòÇ

[2023-04-03T20:36:15] Oreo huzky: The motor didn‚Äôt burn just the controller
[2023-04-03T20:36:38] Mirono escooters: U sure? Motor prob ok
[2023-04-03T20:37:20] Oreo huzky: Motor is totally fine
[2023-04-03T20:37:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: If the motor oversaturate and overheat too much, then the motor observer will gone crazy and do stranger things. Specially for these Chinese vesc that has 0 protection
[2023-04-03T20:37:36] Oreo huzky: Didn‚Äôt overheat at all
[2023-04-03T20:37:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: And how you know that? You‚Äôve temp sensor?
[2023-04-03T20:38:00] Oreo huzky: Motor was 40 degrees
[2023-04-03T20:38:53] Oreo huzky: Got a temp measure gun
[2023-04-03T20:39:40] Mirono escooters: Cover isn't stator tho üò∂
[2023-04-03T20:39:56] Oreo huzky: Not cover back side
[2023-04-03T20:40:26] Oreo huzky: And this thing was a bit hotter like 57 degrees
[2023-04-03T20:40:41] Oreo huzky: The black part where the nut is
[2023-04-03T20:41:25] Mirono escooters: How is that 57* ü§î
[2023-04-03T20:41:51] Oreo huzky: It‚Äôs connected to the stator so it passes the heat though
[2023-04-03T20:42:14] Oreo huzky: The part where the nut is screwed too
[2023-04-03T20:42:18] Mirono escooters: Metal isn't a good heat conductor tho Well, not super.
[2023-04-03T20:43:00] Oreo huzky: But still if it was overheating it would be way hotter because I did a really aggressive long drive with a lot of hard acceleration
[2023-04-03T20:43:26] Mirono escooters: Best is temp sensor inside
[2023-04-03T20:43:36] Mirono escooters: I'm just Betting on cheap makerbase But did both die, simultaneously?
[2023-04-03T20:45:53] Oreo huzky: Yes
[2023-04-03T20:46:19] Oreo huzky: What‚Äôs kv of high speed ly motor
[2023-04-03T20:47:53] Mirono escooters: Tf, that's very weird Were you ebraking? Battery cutted out and poof?
[2023-04-03T20:48:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: Just remind, a winding could be burnt in just 2 second , when the cover is still cold
[2023-04-03T20:53:28] Oreo huzky: Hm where was I e braking I was accelerating when it happened
[2023-04-03T20:54:06] sombre_enfant: Battery cut
[2023-04-03T20:54:18] Oreo huzky: Motors suddenly started to lockup and vesc didn‚Äôt do anything
[2023-04-03T20:54:33] Oreo huzky: And bms turned battery off when it happened
[2023-04-03T20:55:16] Mirono escooters: I think it was BMS cut
[2023-04-03T20:55:50] Oreo huzky: No bms didn‚Äôt cut
[2023-04-03T20:56:11] Mirono escooters: Its just weird both died simultaneously. Makes me look immediately at BMS
[2023-04-03T20:56:34] Oreo huzky: yes
[2023-04-03T20:56:38] Oreo huzky: Both
[2023-04-03T20:57:20] Oreo huzky: The tape on the battery was a bit milky I will take photo of it when at home
[2023-04-03T20:57:26] Oreo huzky: On dual
[2023-04-03T20:57:37] Oreo huzky: No 452 on each
[2023-04-03T21:04:28] Oreo huzky: Can
[2023-04-03T21:06:24] Mirono escooters: Tape? Milky??
[2023-04-03T21:07:46] Oreo huzky: I will show when I‚Äôm at home
[2023-04-03T21:07:52] Oreo huzky: In 10 min
[2023-04-03T21:11:32] Oreo huzky: Now I have to travel by bicycle üò™
[2023-04-03T21:14:47] Mirono escooters: Oof
[2023-04-03T21:14:49] Mirono escooters: Degradation
[2023-04-03T21:20:18] Oreo huzky: <video_file>
[2023-04-03T21:21:15] Oreo huzky: But the battery might actually had cutoff because I just looked at a screen recoding that I did from ant bms and cell voltage was quite low under acceleration it go to 2.9V
[2023-04-03T21:22:03] Mirono escooters: Problably, yes
[2023-04-03T21:23:46] Oreo huzky: Very strange
[2023-04-03T21:24:36] Mirono escooters: Somewhere here was a explanation
[2023-04-03T21:26:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: Same controller if not even worse üòÖ
[2023-04-03T21:26:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: Still survived
[2023-04-03T21:32:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: It cutted already but strangely no dead
[2023-04-03T21:33:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Battery was over stressed a lot, it cutted becaus of undervoltage
[2023-04-03T21:33:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: Just look at how cells was unbalanced
[2023-04-03T21:34:23] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2023-04-03T21:34:29] Oreo huzky: Ah good I thought I was the only one with bad cell diff under load
[2023-04-03T21:35:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: No because I‚Äôve limited space, and pushed it over limits
[2023-04-03T21:35:25] Oreo huzky: Hm how is cell diff so bad then?
[2023-04-03T21:35:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: Pack is 280A peak , under 355A discharge (obviously peak)
[2023-04-03T21:35:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: Only 7p battery‚Ä¶
[2023-04-03T21:46:55] Oreo huzky: Ah okay what cells
[2023-04-03T22:01:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: Vtc6a 21700
[2023-04-03T22:02:32] Oreo huzky: Ah okay
[2023-04-03T22:36:35] Konstantin: Heh... If go like fuckeriiiiyaaa just set 3.2v*S to start decrease power on vesc...
[2023-04-03T23:02:47] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes it's true

[2023-04-04T10:05:16] Face de Pin Suc√©: Well, it was not that international, most of people were Spanish, and then there were us, french and 2 people from Switzerland haha
[2023-04-04T10:05:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Anyway neat ,i like when ppl gather like this, international makes it more sweet
[2023-04-04T10:05:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You are one of the First international

[2023-04-04T10:15:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Do you and Rs maybe know these Swiss ppl?
[2023-04-04T10:15:21] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, we had an amazing race between him and Quentin (my pilot on Purple Compact) in semifinals
[2023-04-04T10:16:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: With which scooter?
[2023-04-04T10:16:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Cool ,Jose has it all üëç
[2023-04-04T10:16:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Is that you? In the last vid
[2023-04-04T10:16:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: Best one was Vsett10+ motor single in rear with 7212 Kelly and 20S battery, he won the finals with 16 seconds without front brake because he broke his rim so he borrowed one from someone and disc wasn't on it
[2023-04-04T10:17:16] sombre_enfant: What frame ?
[2023-04-04T10:17:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: I'm the one with black shirt Rage Mechanics filming haha
[2023-04-04T10:17:39] Face de Pin Suc√©: Ninebot G30
[2023-04-04T10:17:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: The second was m365? üòÇ
[2023-04-04T10:17:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Coolüëçnow we know you
[2023-04-04T10:18:12] Face de Pin Suc√©: Dualtron Spider and third was M365 from swiss too haha
[2023-04-04T10:22:58] Jan: I dont
[2023-04-04T10:26:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: They are great guys, we invited them to our villa after the race and had a lot of fun, and they are running Rage Mechanics motors on the Dualtron Ultra üòÅüòÅ
[2023-04-04T10:29:01] Oreo huzky: Is u box better than flipsky?

[2023-04-04T10:44:23] Oreo huzky: I want to have 150A dc per motor at 84V and 350A phase amps per motor and maybe a bit of fieldweakening like 60A per motor is u box v2 100V 200A suitable
[2023-04-04T10:49:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: Not at all
[2023-04-04T10:50:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: You described the specifications of C350 literally
[2023-04-04T10:51:14] Face de Pin Suc√©: Ubox is capable of around 150A phase without modification and 50-60A DC per motor
[2023-04-04T10:52:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: If you want VESC with those specs, you need to go for this https://rage-mechanics.com/controleur-/24-c350.html
[2023-04-04T10:56:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Nice Rafael also üëçüëå
[2023-04-04T10:56:58] Oreo huzky: To expensive
[2023-04-04T10:59:47] Face de Pin Suc√©: You won't find anything with the specs you ask at lower price for VESC
[2023-04-04T11:01:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And that's a single, right?
[2023-04-04T11:01:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yeah
[2023-04-04T11:04:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Just too make sure he gets it ,he needs 2* too expensive
[2023-04-04T11:04:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: For that power
[2023-04-04T11:07:29] Face de Pin Suc√©: Exactly
[2023-04-04T11:11:25] Thierry: üá®üá≠ü§©
[2023-04-04T11:18:49] Oreo huzky: Or normal esc with those specs but needs to have Bluetooth
[2023-04-04T11:27:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: Kelly 7230
[2023-04-04T11:30:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: If they uses better mosfet would be enough also 7218 ü•≤ but they decided to use 5.5mR rdsOn fets
[2023-04-04T11:38:49] Oreo huzky: Still to expensive
[2023-04-04T11:40:11] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Will never find any close to that specs and that dimensions. Esp.c350/cl350. Astonishing balance between dimensions/voltage/power
[2023-04-04T11:40:44] Jose: <video_file>
[2023-04-04T11:40:58] Jose: Champion esc
[2023-04-04T11:41:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: If you don't want to use your money, you can't have high performance
[2023-04-04T11:41:22] Face de Pin Suc√©: Kelly is the less expansive in the market for that kind of power
[2023-04-04T11:41:53] Oreo huzky: Dimensions don‚Äôt matter
[2023-04-04T11:42:39] Oreo huzky: I will just stay with flipsky 75200 and make sure my battery dosent cut off
[2023-04-04T11:43:29] Oreo huzky: But I still had some problems because I tried all types of observers and bemf decoupling and my motor still stutters a bit under high load
[2023-04-04T11:47:09] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: On what speed?
[2023-04-04T11:47:37] Face de Pin Suc√©: same here with 6.0 and 6.2 firmware
[2023-04-04T11:47:46] Face de Pin Suc√©: I use 5.3 for now, only one working
[2023-04-04T11:48:49] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Looks like too much current for steel of the motor
[2023-04-04T11:48:55] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Not fw fault
[2023-04-04T11:52:23] Face de Pin Suc√©: Well, working perfectly with 5.3 but going for 6 or 6.2 not working anymore with exactly same parameters
[2023-04-04T12:01:59] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But current is the same in logs on both fw?
[2023-04-04T12:02:30] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Not in parameters but measured by vesc
[2023-04-04T12:03:27] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: For example you set phase to 300A, and vesc actually measured 400-450A in log and in fact in motor
[2023-04-04T12:03:54] Oreo huzky: Any speed
[2023-04-04T12:05:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, same
[2023-04-04T12:14:37] Oreo huzky: Can I do something against the stuttering?
[2023-04-04T12:27:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: I told you, it‚Äôs over saturation
[2023-04-04T12:28:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: Too much current on small stator isn‚Äôt good
[2023-04-04T12:32:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt have, and mine is even worse üòÇ
[2023-04-04T12:32:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: No, Jake said mks is worse
[2023-04-04T12:33:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: We are trying 4 different types of mosfet
[2023-04-04T12:57:29] Mirono escooters: Mp2 for the W
[2023-04-04T13:12:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: No lol
[2023-04-04T13:12:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: We use to220
[2023-04-04T13:13:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: I mean we testing different types of to220
[2023-04-04T13:17:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: 250-300‚Ç¨ 150A dc continuos and 350 phase
[2023-04-04T13:17:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: Actually it can does these specs in single motor with shit fet
[2023-04-04T13:28:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: Similar to flipsky 75200
[2023-04-04T13:28:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: But more high
[2023-04-04T14:21:12] J√°nos T√≥th: Hi, if I get negative abs overcurrent(130 is set, and got -160 ) Than its possible ,that I connected the current sensors in the opposit way?
[2023-04-04T18:04:29] Oreo huzky: Is the controller Brocken because no short between plus and minus but motor still turns hard when it‚Äôs attached
[2023-04-04T18:04:33] Oreo huzky: <video_file>
[2023-04-04T18:09:52] Mirono escooters: MOSFETs
[2023-04-04T18:10:48] Oreo huzky: But if mosfet it would show short between plus and minus or wouldn‚Äôt it?
[2023-04-04T18:19:12] Federico77: I know that you have to try both positive and negative with the 3 engine phases, if it gives continuity the mosfets are burned and consequently short-circuited
[2023-04-04T18:19:29] Oreo huzky: Okay one sec
[2023-04-04T18:20:23] Oreo huzky: Still no short cuircuit
[2023-04-04T18:21:03] Oreo huzky: Now plus and minus is giving short
[2023-04-04T18:21:26] Konstantin: Test all phase to battery, chose diode, and show v drop. Usually if all ok ~~0.5v
[2023-04-04T18:22:43] Federico77: I do not know if I explained myself well, an tip goes on the negative and with another tip of the tester try the 3 engine phases, then do the same with the positive, if the mosfets are burned should give continuity
[2023-04-04T18:23:44] Oreo huzky: <video_file>
[2023-04-04T18:23:51] Oreo huzky: I know what you meant
[2023-04-04T18:24:10] Oreo huzky: I testet all cables phase and battery cables
[2023-04-04T18:24:36] Konstantin: Looking üëç...
[2023-04-04T18:24:47] Konstantin: M - magic ‚ú®
[2023-04-04T18:24:58] Oreo huzky: But motor is locking when attached to phase cable
[2023-04-04T18:29:44] Mirono escooters: MOSFETs
[2023-04-04T18:30:30] Oreo huzky: Wtf now it‚Äôs not locking
[2023-04-04T18:31:01] Mirono escooters: Or MOSFET was shorted open or connectors fucked
[2023-04-04T18:33:53] Oreo huzky: Now blue light turns on when I turn wheel fast enough
[2023-04-04T18:34:36] Oreo huzky: Doesn‚Äôt that mean that it works?
[2023-04-04T18:43:47] Jason Nelson: If it was a loose phase wouldn't it spin freely?
[2023-04-04T18:44:09] Jason Nelson: Sounds like a bad mosfet to me
[2023-04-04T18:44:10] Mirono escooters: Power it and see
[2023-04-04T18:44:16] Mirono escooters: Backemf
[2023-04-04T18:44:20] Oreo huzky: Okay
[2023-04-04T18:45:07] Oreo huzky: If I turn ant bms off with app and turn discharge back on with app it will give fault if short is in esc right?
[2023-04-04T18:46:22] Mirono escooters: Ye
[2023-04-04T18:54:54] Oreo huzky: Ant bms is still giving out 30V when discharge is turned off
[2023-04-04T18:57:14] Oreo huzky: Never mind I will just attach it to 9V monoblock
[2023-04-04T18:58:17] Mirono escooters: Try loading it. Itll drop to 0
[2023-04-04T19:05:57] Oreo huzky: If I add 3 of them in series it works I can connect and it shows low voltage error in vesc app
[2023-04-04T19:08:07] Oreo huzky: So that means it still works
[2023-04-04T19:11:00] Oreo huzky: If connect ant bms it works
[2023-04-04T19:49:20] Unknown: I guess using those same holes that attach lid to the bottom to are easiest way to attach the whole shit to scooter
[2023-04-04T19:52:20] Konstantin: It's ok, show low voltage, but 0 amp. On 3s battery all ok?
[2023-04-04T20:24:50] Unknown: But then i would have to drill holes there? Those holes are like m2. I think i would have like 0% change to make those threads to right place üòÖ But why that my method isnt good?
[2023-04-04T20:43:30] Unknown: Nope. There isnt Any holes on that top piece
[2023-04-04T20:44:55] Unknown: <photos/photo_8078@04-04-2023_20-44-55.jpg>
[2023-04-04T20:45:07] Unknown: <photos/photo_8079@04-04-2023_20-45-07.jpg>
[2023-04-04T20:51:12] Unknown: If i would make holes just to bottom and then mount it after attach i wouldnt have Any change to attach the top piece
[2023-04-04T21:06:42] Oreo huzky: Bruh the vesc didn‚Äôt burn out one mosfet cracked and it seems reasonable because when it happened I was driving over a bump and the vesc was losely attached
[2023-04-04T21:06:46] Oreo huzky: <photos/photo_8080@04-04-2023_21-06-46.jpg>
[2023-04-04T22:26:27] Oreo huzky: Does anyone know what mosfet is in flipsky 75200
[2023-04-04T22:27:08] Konstantin: Like on 75100
[2023-04-04T22:27:38] Mirono escooters: Crack should be from just too much power die
[2023-04-04T22:29:43] Andrew Edwards: <video_file>
[2023-04-04T22:29:44] Andrew Edwards: <video_file>
[2023-04-04T22:29:45] Andrew Edwards: <video_file>
[2023-04-04T22:34:57] Oreo huzky: Really because the other one survived and they where both on the same settings
[2023-04-04T22:35:10] Oreo huzky: But they have a different shape
[2023-04-04T22:36:45] Mirono escooters: Guessing work
[2023-04-04T22:43:18] Konstantin: No. Thy same n015n10 if I remember correctly
[2023-04-04T22:44:18] Oreo huzky: No I thought but one survived
[2023-04-04T22:44:20] Andrew Edwards: <photos/photo_8081@04-04-2023_22-44-20.jpg>
[2023-04-04T22:45:00] Mirono escooters: Ain't vesc ü•∫
[2023-04-04T22:47:08] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-04-04T22:47:45] Konstantin: 9_917b2a18-6ca8-4b32-9088-bb5a0e70057c_1800x1800.jpg
[2023-04-04T22:50:04] Oreo huzky: I have a lab where we have special heat gun for those kind of repairs it is used for phone repairs but it will probably work fine for that
[2023-04-04T22:50:41] Konstantin: You need hot air + bottom heater
[2023-04-04T22:51:24] Mirono escooters: Hot-air yes
[2023-04-04T22:51:33] Mirono escooters: But use a hotplate too
[2023-04-04T22:51:36] Konstantin: I easy do it using only clothes iron xD
[2023-04-04T22:54:15] Oreo huzky: I have that
[2023-04-04T22:54:27] Oreo huzky: That‚Äôs the correct one right?
[2023-04-04T22:55:49] Oreo huzky: Is 2.40‚Ç¨ the correct price?
[2023-04-04T22:55:55] Oreo huzky: Seems a bit cheap?
[2023-04-04T22:57:42] Mirono escooters: Correct
[2023-04-04T22:58:18] AK: I did
[2023-04-04T22:58:50] AK: I'll publish a poc as soon as it is semi-ready
[2023-04-04T22:59:11] AK: But I won't be doing the whole lisp fuckery like I did with the g30, just not worth it
[2023-04-04T22:59:27] Jose: Welcome @SrLobo007 üí™
[2023-04-04T22:59:51] Mirono escooters: @S1m0n_420
[2023-04-04T23:14:21] S1m 0n: ?
[2023-04-04T23:14:26] Oreo huzky: If I remove Broken mosfet short should be gone right?
[2023-04-04T23:14:32] Mirono escooters: For the display
[2023-04-04T23:15:53] S1m 0n: Don't understand
[2023-04-05T01:01:38] Ion: Probably proof of concept, like a prototype
[2023-04-05T06:31:41] AK: Proof of concept
[2023-04-05T06:36:35] AK: If someone wants to try implementing something but has no data dumps
[2023-04-05T07:44:20] S1m 0n: What is P11 & P12 for a option in ur Display?
[2023-04-05T08:44:37] Happy Giraffe: @roscheeee
[2023-04-05T08:44:57] Happy Giraffe: 250‚Ç¨ and then put a 3000w scooter motor on itüòÇüòÖ
[2023-04-05T12:29:01] Andrew Edwards: What would be a good vesc controller to get for a 50a battery with two batteries in series and it will be single wheel but may go dual
[2023-04-05T12:29:30] Mirono escooters: Vesc
[2023-04-05T12:39:36] Andrew Edwards: What brand is everyone using and that have tested and had good results
[2023-04-05T12:40:55] Mirono escooters: Spintend dual is good
[2023-04-05T12:43:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yep, or 2x ubox 80v100a alu/2x 75100 alu will be the best for the price. Spintend has built in power button to turn on esc
[2023-04-05T13:25:47] Andrew Edwards: Awesome thanks for the info
[2023-04-05T13:38:04] Mirko Boni: Ubox 80V is spectacular
[2023-04-05T13:38:22] Mirko Boni: I'm running it with a single 60H motor and it's amazing
[2023-04-05T16:39:01] Thierry: Does someone tried with 20s?
[2023-04-05T17:35:37] FrizerSeb: personally I recharge up to 4v max by cell it's perfect and it preserves the battery
[2023-04-06T03:06:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Just killed my Makerbase 75100 Alu PCB
[2023-04-06T03:07:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Long walk home üòÖ
[2023-04-06T03:07:13] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I pushed it for a few km almost full throttle
[2023-04-06T03:08:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and suddenly motor break
[2023-04-06T03:08:24] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: so I guess MOSFETs bye bye
[2023-04-06T03:08:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yeah really hard to push, well, time for a walk.
[2023-04-06T03:09:24] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Haha not as bad at 3AM
[2023-04-06T03:09:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No idea. I have done log recording tho
[2023-04-06T03:09:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But not too hot I would have seen it on my m365 display
[2023-04-06T03:10:15] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: My phone mount broke recently so wasn't able to make screen record
[2023-04-06T03:10:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: was chilling at 70kph
[2023-04-06T03:12:13] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No idea
[2023-04-06T03:19:27] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but it was a surprisingly smooth death
[2023-04-06T03:27:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: man I need unpluggable motor cables from the outside üòÇ full break workout
[2023-04-06T04:06:03] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: walking... walking..
[2023-04-06T04:06:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: rear always taking off while pushing, fuck front motor
[2023-04-06T04:26:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Soon at home...
[2023-04-06T04:28:34] Mirko Boni: How bad is a breakdown at night?
[2023-04-06T04:38:39] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Really bad
[2023-04-06T04:43:14] Mirko Boni: do you already know what happened?
[2023-04-06T04:45:45] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Finally home.
[2023-04-06T04:45:52] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No idea, but I would guess heat.
[2023-04-06T04:46:36] Mirko Boni: But did you have vesc tool switched on in your smartphone?
[2023-04-06T04:47:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, but in my pocket. I will now check log
[2023-04-06T04:48:03] Mirko Boni: OK OK.. But in the dashboard did the high temperature icon report to you?
[2023-04-06T04:50:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Nope, it did not report high temps, at least not known to the ESC.
[2023-04-06T04:54:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 44¬∞C and then it died
[2023-04-06T04:55:45] Mirko Boni: But it's not a high temperature üòî
[2023-04-06T04:57:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <photos/photo_8086@06-04-2023_04-57-44.jpg>
[2023-04-06T04:59:41] Mirko Boni: Could it be the fault of the flipsky's reliability? I have read that unfortunately they are easily damaged
[2023-04-06T05:00:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Most likely and the fact that I was fiddling around with field weakening while being on 22S (not full charged, it was at 84v)
[2023-04-06T05:04:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It did work for 3 months but it was the first time I pushed it for 2km I think.
[2023-04-06T05:06:02] Mirko Boni: Ok ok now I understand..
[2023-04-06T05:11:31] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But I am still surprised on how smoothly it died, still was scared from the first time it happened at less speed but during acceleration.
[2023-04-06T05:15:59] Mirko Boni: Maybe there is something else.. Maybe the vesc has no damage?
[2023-04-06T06:26:11] rosheee: XD
[2023-04-06T06:26:27] rosheee: face de race suc√©
[2023-04-06T06:26:50] rosheee: XD
[2023-04-06T06:27:05] rosheee: I WROTE AMY THAT THIS ISN'T MY SCOOTER XD THAT A FRIEND SHARED ME THAT
[2023-04-06T06:27:10] rosheee: @mirkus74
[2023-04-06T06:27:17] rosheee: my 16S now back to 96kmh
[2023-04-06T06:28:16] rosheee: please send amy as much logfiles n videos as possible ^^ if you have their new 6fet (and had the old one) comparison
[2023-04-06T07:21:39] Mirko Boni: @roscheeee what's up?
[2023-04-06T07:21:44] Mirko Boni: Are you alive?
[2023-04-06T07:23:48] Mirko Boni: This video is not mine.. You are wrong.. My video is different..
[2023-04-06T07:24:39] Mirko Boni: I sent Amy a video of the ubox 75v2 16S dual motor
[2023-04-06T07:25:51] rosheee: perfect
[2023-04-06T07:25:59] rosheee: i havent checked video xD
[2023-04-06T07:26:08] rosheee: thought yours ahaha üòÜ
[2023-04-06T07:26:10] rosheee: send her logfiles
[2023-04-06T07:26:15] rosheee: i told her u are super happy
[2023-04-06T07:38:53] Mirko Boni: Roger, we have to write to Amy about the vesc 12 mosfet.. We have to write every week because I am very late
[2023-04-06T07:41:21] Mirko Boni: So if they see that we are all writing together at least they wake up from hibernation
[2023-04-06T07:44:14] rosheee: yes
[2023-04-06T07:44:19] rosheee: but they need data as well
[2023-04-06T11:25:51] Gigolo Joe: High kv motors?
[2023-04-06T11:27:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Vsett
[2023-04-06T11:27:55] Gigolo Joe: Is that a 'yes' ?ü§î
[2023-04-06T11:49:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: No
[2023-04-06T11:49:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Standard kv
[2023-04-06T11:51:59] Gigolo Joe: I have no idea what kv are the vsett motor, that's why I'm asking. 96kmh on 16s is hella impressive
[2023-04-06T11:55:28] Face de Pin Suc√©: I guess he's pushing field weakening
[2023-04-06T11:57:04] Gigolo Joe: For sure I run dual setup on 20s and high fw, still having hard time to go over 100kmh
[2023-04-06T12:11:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: Lol
[2023-04-06T12:11:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: We did more than 100kmh with 15s
[2023-04-06T12:11:36] Gigolo Joe: Nope Inokim
[2023-04-06T12:14:26] Gigolo Joe: Rear one is ox, did a rewound to push more amps Front one is stock oxo
[2023-04-06T12:15:37] S1m 0n: a colleague broke 2¬Ω flipskys in 2 or 3 weeks. first the 75100 Alu, which simply stopped working after one ride and gave no sign of life (20s). Then he had my 75100 non alu, which was no longer after a short test drive .. later with a 13s battery it suddenly ran again, currently he works together with an 18s battery. Then my colleague got the 75200 Alu ... it sparked directly when it was first put together and since then the caps have been buzzing, but otherwise it's also dead
[2023-04-06T12:16:10] Gigolo Joe: Not high, gotta re check iirc, rear is 22kv front is 28kv
[2023-04-06T12:16:53] Gigolo Joe: Only rear Kv stays the same
[2023-04-06T12:16:58] Gigolo Joe: 4t
[2023-04-06T12:17:21] Gigolo Joe: Didn't change number of turns
[2023-04-06T12:18:26] Gigolo Joe: The windings for a better ones, 24 wire 0.4mm thickness with high temperature enamel on them
[2023-04-06T12:19:20] Gigolo Joe: If so than very slightly, because number of turns stays the same
[2023-04-06T12:19:55] T·ëå·ñá·ó∑O·îï·ó©·îï·ëï·ïº: With std kv and 16s Not possible
[2023-04-06T12:20:18] Gigolo Joe: They are 55mm if not mistaken
[2023-04-06T12:20:55] T·ëå·ñá·ó∑O·îï·ó©·îï·ëï·ïº: Freewheel max is with std kv and 16s 98kmh
[2023-04-06T12:21:04] Gigolo Joe: To increase kv u lower number of turns but wind much THICCER phase
[2023-04-06T12:21:26] Gigolo Joe: Breh I'm already pushing 80a fw üòÇüòÇ
[2023-04-06T12:22:06] Gigolo Joe: Rear: 180 phase 75 bat Front: 150 phase 75 bat 80a fw on each
[2023-04-06T12:22:25] Gigolo Joe: Tried 100a fw, didn't change top speed
[2023-04-06T12:22:54] Gigolo Joe: <photos/photo_8087@06-04-2023_12-22-54.jpg>
[2023-04-06T12:23:12] Gigolo Joe: Tried 100a battery on each, with 80a fw
[2023-04-06T12:23:28] Gigolo Joe: Nah
[2023-04-06T12:23:32] Gigolo Joe: Need more
[2023-04-06T12:24:13] Gigolo Joe: Not really Helped with acceleration
[2023-04-06T12:24:33] Gigolo Joe: Wheelspin upto 80kmh
[2023-04-06T12:24:56] Gigolo Joe: Smol 75100v2
[2023-04-06T12:25:04] Gigolo Joe: <sticker>
[2023-04-06T12:26:43] Gigolo Joe: Imma redo motor configuration and try some more batt amps per each controller
[2023-04-06T12:27:13] Gigolo Joe: Also measure with dragy
[2023-04-06T12:27:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: Possible , wit 50mm motor
[2023-04-06T12:27:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: 17kw
[2023-04-06T12:28:02] T·ëå·ñá·ó∑O·îï·ó©·îï·ëï·ïº: With your std kv not possible
[2023-04-06T12:28:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: Mtpa + field weakening
[2023-04-06T12:28:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: We did it

[2023-04-06T12:29:37] T·ëå·ñá·ó∑O·îï·ó©·îï·ëï·ïº: Batt 65A
[2023-04-06T12:30:16] T·ëå·ñá·ó∑O·îï·ó©·îï·ëï·ïº: Phase?
[2023-04-06T12:30:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: Normal, 50mm is faster than 60mm, but less torque
[2023-04-06T12:31:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: 180 and 200
[2023-04-06T12:31:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: But in speed batt current is more important
[2023-04-06T12:31:30] T·ëå·ñá·ó∑O·îï·ó©·îï·ëï·ïº: And batt set 130?
[2023-04-06T12:31:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2023-04-06T12:32:07] T·ëå·ñá·ó∑O·îï·ó©·îï·ëï·ïº: My batt builder told me max 65a is possible
[2023-04-06T12:32:33] T·ëå·ñá·ó∑O·îï·ó©·îï·ëï·ïº: My bms only can 80a
[2023-04-06T12:33:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, we ve 15s9p vtc6a, 360a possible
[2023-04-06T12:53:03] T·ëå·ñá·ó∑O·îï·ó©·îï·ëï·ïº: That is very much. I have the M50LT.
[2023-04-06T12:53:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: Uhhh
[2023-04-06T12:53:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: 6p with m50lt is very little current
[2023-04-06T12:53:53] Gigolo Joe: Battery? Damn nice üëå
[2023-04-06T12:54:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, not for intense use
[2023-04-06T12:55:24] T·ëå·ñá·ó∑O·îï·ó©·îï·ëï·ïº: How much amps you think is max what i can set?
[2023-04-06T12:56:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: 65A per motor so it‚Äôs yes your limit
[2023-04-06T12:56:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: Why not chooses other cells like molicel
[2023-04-06T13:05:23] Mirono escooters: High capacity lol
[2023-04-06T13:07:04] T·ëå·ñá·ó∑O·îï·ó©·îï·ëï·ïº: Now you know why i need the normal motor
[2023-04-06T13:16:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, so the last I gave you is the best for your battery configuration
[2023-04-06T13:34:27] T·ëå·ñá·ó∑O·îï·ó©·îï·ëï·ïº: When you gave me battery configurations?
[2023-04-06T13:36:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: ?
[2023-04-06T13:36:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: I mean the motor
[2023-04-06T13:36:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: The last you bought
[2023-04-06T13:36:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: High kv no good for small battery
[2023-04-06T13:40:04] T·ëå·ñá·ó∑O·îï·ó©·îï·ëï·ïº: Ah ok. I will sell your std kv motor. May be anyone here is interested ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2023-04-06T13:43:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: Why you don‚Äôt like it?
[2023-04-06T13:43:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: Isn‚Äôt better standard kv for your battery?
[2023-04-06T13:51:39] T·ëå·ñá·ó∑O·îï·ó©·îï·ëï·ïº: The Blade i‚Äòve bought from you last year was better, but 50mm. The front 60mm runs similar the blade and have more torque.
[2023-04-06T14:57:36] Oreo huzky: Can the stock GD 30 2 controller handle 48V?

[2023-04-06T15:08:31] Gigolo Joe: 63kmh on 70v charge and 80a battery each 75kmh on 70v charge and 100a battery each
[2023-04-06T15:10:17] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: What.. motor accelerates until voltage of the motor will equal to battery voltage, doesnt matter on battery amps. Thats called kv. Already discussed there much times
[2023-04-06T15:11:13] Gigolo Joe: That's what weird
[2023-04-06T15:11:19] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Or this is 2 different motors then
[2023-04-06T15:11:33] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You cant cheat physics

[2023-04-06T17:43:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: was just cruising at 110A phase, at start it was about 155A so nothing crazy
[2023-04-06T17:47:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Hopefully it's just cable that melted or damaged
[2023-04-06T17:48:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I wasn't even doing much to the motor
[2023-04-06T17:50:17] Mirono escooters: "nothing crazy" lol
[2023-04-06T17:50:23] Mirono escooters: U did abuse it mucho already

[2023-04-06T17:56:45] Face de Pin Suc√©: Put at least 4 square wires
[2023-04-06T17:56:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: Better is 6 square but tricky
[2023-04-06T17:57:22] Face de Pin Suc√©: <photos/photo_8092@06-04-2023_17-57-22.jpg>
[2023-04-06T17:57:24] Face de Pin Suc√©: Like this
[2023-04-06T17:57:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: I did this 2 years ago, and it's still running perfectly with 6 square wires inside
[2023-04-06T17:57:47] Face de Pin Suc√©: Pushing 7218S kellys
[2023-04-06T17:58:03] Mirono escooters: Without halls? Does that even fit through statot
[2023-04-06T17:59:33] Face de Pin Suc√©: With halls of course, this is Kelly, you need halls
[2023-04-06T18:00:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: <video_file>
[2023-04-06T18:00:45] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Maybe @PaoloWu can tell me what I can fit through the Blade 1200w stator.
[2023-04-06T18:01:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But I need to open it anyway
[2023-04-06T18:01:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: so well try and hope it fits, just need to find a good solution for the halls or I go HFI and fuck halls but rather not...
[2023-04-06T18:03:46] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I always use these.
[2023-04-06T18:05:09] Mirono escooters: Id go bigger
[2023-04-06T18:05:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Just soldering big cable outside would be enough to dissipate the heat
[2023-04-06T18:05:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_8094@06-04-2023_18-05-29.jpg>

[2023-04-06T18:06:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Charger cable rofl
[2023-04-06T18:08:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Might be but worked for a long long time already, but maybe solder joint was bad on the MKS because I did do much much longer runs on all other VESCs that I had before, only this one melted it.
[2023-04-06T18:12:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: At least it happend now and not with MP2 frying it üòÖ @Mirono_escooters
[2023-04-06T18:13:03] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But I am wondering if the Makerbase 75100 Alu PCB survived this. But I don't think so, but maaaybe.
[2023-04-06T18:19:58] Mirono escooters: There's a change
[2023-04-06T18:28:33] Face de Pin Suc√©: Cables will melt, I've seen on Weped people using bigger wires only after the axle, then it melted inside the axle
[2023-04-06T18:36:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: I know, it don‚Äôt resolve, but it help
[2023-04-06T18:37:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: Copper conduct heat, more is the copper area more the thin part will be cooled
[2023-04-06T18:38:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes but it will act as a fuse
[2023-04-06T18:38:12] Face de Pin Suc√©: From experience
[2023-04-06T18:39:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: I know, that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt ride it for too long time
[2023-04-06T18:44:30] Jason Nelson: Can someone tell me what I have to do to get my adc2 to be detected by vesc? When I do throttle setup it shows and it's values are mapped but I doesn't seem to control electronic braking and different show up on my real time mapping
[2023-04-06T18:44:36] Jason Nelson: Doesn't show up*
[2023-04-06T18:47:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: You have to mod firmware and switch input
[2023-04-06T19:00:32] Konstantin: Set ? current control no reverse brake adc2 Or simple Current control
[2023-04-06T19:09:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @jamessoderstrom https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/issues/609 Did you test this now?
[2023-04-06T19:09:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I want to respond to him if it's working now.
[2023-04-06T19:14:16] Jason Nelson: Thank you I got it working
[2023-04-06T21:34:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: How thick do hall sensor cable need to be? Doesn't matter, ay? üëÄ
[2023-04-06T21:34:21] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I think so
[2023-04-06T21:34:24] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Should be included

[2023-04-07T01:57:07] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It has nothing to do with it. Just old board I had lying around and salvaged for components
[2023-04-07T01:58:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: Ah Ok
[2023-04-07T01:58:44] Rogerio Figueiredo: S√≥ 75100 V2 makerbase is good
[2023-04-07T01:59:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, not best and with some flaws, but worth every penny üòÅ
[2023-04-07T02:00:38] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I have not tested yet
[2023-04-07T02:00:53] Rogerio Figueiredo: When my arrived put some artic silver thermal paste and neve got any issue but low power and only 16s
[2023-04-07T04:26:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Ok I have now tested if motor can spin freely on the VESC and it does! :) Good sign, phases not shorted, means the mosfets survived, but don't know about any other electronics. I will properly test it on my test bench with PSU later.

[2023-04-08T04:08:37] Luis Magalhaes: gayüòÇ
[2023-04-08T04:11:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It's generally recommended to choose capacitors with a low ESR (Equivalent Series Resistance). Low ESR capacitors have a lower resistance to the flow of alternating current (AC) and are better suited for high-frequency switching applications. They can handle high-frequency currents without overheating or causing damage to the circuit, and they are less likely to produce unwanted noise.
[2023-04-08T04:18:52] rosheee: So dis not happens
[2023-04-08T05:31:45] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yup

[2023-04-08T09:01:33] gil guy: Yes. Or mix electrolytic capacitors with 100~470nF ceramic caps. Better for high frequency filtering..

[2023-04-08T09:32:29] Mirono escooters: Need lowest esr
[2023-04-08T09:33:36] Mirono escooters: Ceramic should be on pcb already
[2023-04-08T10:24:55] AK: Low esr is important, everything else is secondary. Preferably not less than reference design, unless you calculated yourself how much you need
[2023-04-08T10:25:32] AK: No, this is paolo xiaomi team, capacitance is secondary
[2023-04-08T11:03:11] S1m 0n: Larger capacity means that the capacitor takes longer to charge. This can destabilize under circumstances and destroy the esc

[2023-04-10T14:10:26] Ion: Hey, just some quick questions (i'm sure its answered somewhere in the thread) Could I use this as just a display without connecting the accelerator and brake to it? I plan on using the spintend ADC adapter for this. How does it limit the speed and power? Does it change between vesc profiles?
[2023-04-10T14:15:03] AK: You can, the display does not care about brake/throttle adc, no idea about the script itself
[2023-04-10T17:37:38] AK: It can, it's a question of implementation. I have stock throttle and brake connected to vesc, and the display only for speedometer purposes.
[2023-04-10T17:38:34] AK: The ble as said does not generate adc errors, it can run with throttle/brake hanging in the air
[2023-04-10T17:51:33] AK: I have a separate button set on adc3, and change speed modes with that. Zuna is aware of the whole thing, when he finds time, I bet he can implement it in his script as well.
[2023-04-10T17:53:21] AK: It can, there is no difference. Processing gas/throttle on the ble is completely optional, nothing prevents you not doing so.
[2023-04-10T17:57:12] AK: I think it's just a historical thing, a lot of people didn't want to relay additional wiring. I myself don't trust my throttle/brake to two additional processing steps, so I bypassed the ninebot ble directly from the beginning.
[2023-04-10T18:02:36] Simone: Hi all, I have to repair the hall sensors of a motor coming from the zero10x but visually the central hall sensor has the feet protection of a different color.

[2023-04-10T18:04:46] Simone: on falconpev they sell a card complete with hall sensor and in the description it speaks of vsett10 but there are several images and it is not clear if they are illustrative or real photos

[2023-04-10T19:49:01] Mirono escooters: XD that's bs
[2023-04-10T20:11:16] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, this is possible, it can be used without throttle and brake connected to the dashboard when the input handler is removed. However, there are a few drawbacks: No motor start speed option and no button combinations based on throttle and brake. It also does not prevent the scooter from running if the dashboard is switched off or locked. This can of course be done in another way, such as disabling the ADC application while the dash is off or locked, and getting the throttle and brake inputs from the ADC input, but the purpose of the script is to avoid having to connect the ADC to the VESC at all.
[2023-04-10T20:12:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Another option would be to override the ADC inputs from the script, but this is an unstable feature in my eyes, as there is (was?) no timeout for adc override in VESC. I am not sure if this has been fixed, but this implementation would allow traction control and other features to work with the input.
[2023-04-10T20:18:20] Basti: is there anyone here who drives the vsett 10+ with the original esc and 20s?
[2023-04-10T20:18:37] Mirono escooters: Original?? 20s?üò∂
[2023-04-10T20:18:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: No possible
[2023-04-10T20:19:03] Basti: Ok how much is possible with vsett10+ esc
[2023-04-10T20:19:33] Ion: Ok thank you. I'll probably get back to you if I have any questions and decide to go that route. Cool project
[2023-04-10T20:20:23] Ion: Also, is anyone using a Ninebot display on a Vsett 10+? Is there some 3d printable case for it?
[2023-04-10T20:24:37] Basti: only 16s with the stock esc or a little more 18s ?
[2023-04-10T20:27:32] S1m 0n: Why is this not possible? The voltage converter of the controller can up to 150V. Caps might have to be replaced. Fets could also become critical with 85V/120A. But in principle I think it is possible to mod the controller like the Ninebot/Xiaomi controller.
[2023-04-10T20:27:55] Mirono escooters: 85v fets on 84v , hum
[2023-04-10T20:27:58] Mirono escooters: I wouldn't ebrake
[2023-04-10T20:28:45] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Replace MOSFETs and Capacitors and try till it burns?
[2023-04-10T20:30:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: Lol, he says by stock
[2023-04-10T20:30:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: Anything can be modified to reach very high voltage, but the question is if worth itüòÜ
[2023-04-10T20:32:49] S1m 0n: It's always worth a try if you have the time
[2023-04-10T20:40:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: No, because any pcb has its limit. Much thing affect, like electromagnetic field , noises etc
[2023-04-10T20:40:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: They use magnachip
[2023-04-10T21:14:12] S1m 0n: How can you estimate how much a PCB could withstand without having to destroy it in a test series? I was of the opinion that traces, MCU DC, fets and caps were decisive... are there any other indications from which one could derive estimates?
[2023-04-10T21:18:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: Any resistor should be calculated again for different voltage, pcb track distances, much other factors. If the mod don‚Äôt has benefit why do it when you can get a vesc for 130$?
[2023-04-10T21:20:57] AK: I strongly disagree with your notion of always-on vesc, it's dangerous in general
[2023-04-10T21:21:44] AK: Same with relying in bms on cutting power, but using a bms without a separate charging port
[2023-04-10T21:21:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I turn off my VESC via SmartBMS
[2023-04-10T21:22:10] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and because I use two batteries in series I plug them out anyway
[2023-04-10T21:22:28] AK: I am not saying, that YOU are not safe üòÇ
[2023-04-10T21:22:54] AK: What I am saying is, since you are making the whole thing more and more popular, you are sort of coresponsible now
[2023-04-10T21:25:46] S1m 0n: Because there's no display that looks original enough to fool the law enforcement officers, or just extremely expensive (SmartDisplay).
[2023-04-10T21:26:58] S1m 0n: Also I am a fan of transform
[2023-04-10T21:33:38] S1m 0n: I found this picture. May well be that Vsett/Zero uses two different reverberators and that the secret is @simone_19
[2023-04-10T21:35:21] S1m 0n: If I understood correctly, there are fast and less fast reverb sensors. That means you mix faster and slower Halls together?
[2023-04-10T21:37:16] S1m 0n: Found that on a description: 3144 Hall -especially for low-power motors below 1000 watt -with relatively low sensing sensitivity -low price and low cost -especially for the electric vehicle maintenance market 41F Hall -is mainly used for low-power motors below 1000 watt -has moderate sensing sensitivity -Relatively stable performance -high cost performance and economic advantages -Mainly supplied to electric vehicle manufacturers 43F Hall -with good sensing sensitivity and stable performance -mostly used in electric three-wheelers from 800 watt to 2000 watt, and a small number of them are used in electric two-wheelers vehicles and four-wheelers vehicles 413 Hall -high sensing sensitivity -faster response -superior performance -high temperature resistance (working temperature-40-150 C) -suitable for high-power motors and low-power motors.
[2023-04-10T22:26:52] Pater Pater: Hi guys. I have a question.
[2023-04-10T22:28:30] Pater Pater: I‚Äôm struggling with something. I have connected a led stripe to the 12V regulator of my PEV, But it seems there‚Äôs a damage in the main controller. I‚Äôm just trying to figure it out if the led strip did cause the damage but taking into account the regulator (XL7056) comes with an internal protection, it seems the damage is related with another thing. I‚Äôm still not sure.

[2023-04-16T18:43:42] sombre_enfant: Tell me your way pls
[2023-04-16T19:51:43] sombre_enfant: Got sameüòÅ what about the brake ? I use 108x fyi 3.3 gnd and adc 2? No capacitor or resistor till i put a display ?
[2023-04-16T20:15:34] sombre_enfant: Its for my 10+ i could put a xiaomi display but need to make an enclosure n shii i dont have no more time
[2023-04-16T20:15:45] sombre_enfant: Thanks James‚ù§Ô∏è
[2023-04-16T21:50:15] Ion: 3D print? You have a link or picture maybe?
[2023-04-16T21:51:20] Konstantin: Sometimes 5v + resistor divider best choice... Reduce dead zone, where throttle start to work...
[2023-04-16T21:57:19] sombre_enfant: Then where i should apply resistor if i use brake on adc2 and gas on adc 1? Do my diagram is ok ?
[2023-04-16T22:12:09] Konstantin: No, for brake w resistor use 3.3v
[2023-04-16T22:13:14] Konstantin: Oh not see 2nd resistor... Sleep 4 hours only xD
[2023-04-16T22:13:25] Konstantin: Looks ok

[2023-04-16T23:19:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: Which group?
[2023-04-16T23:20:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Whut
[2023-04-16T23:20:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: Normally they don‚Äôt remove nothing
[2023-04-16T23:25:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: Lol
[2023-04-16T23:25:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: I said worse comments to rion but they never removed me
[2023-04-16T23:25:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: Even these motors are mine wtf

[2023-04-17T13:06:56] Ion: Does anyone use a key Ignition with a UBOX V1 VESC? According to spintend its not possible, but maybe someone has found a way. As far as i know, the key is just a latching ON/OFF switch. But having the voltmeter would also be nice
[2023-04-17T14:18:35] rosheee: Maybe with spintend adc module
[2023-04-17T15:42:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I had it like that with old awd
[2023-04-17T15:42:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Dual spin v1 with key and button
[2023-04-17T15:43:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If you rewire it its possible
[2023-04-17T15:43:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Make key cut button positive
[2023-04-17T15:43:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And wire out to have voltage
[2023-04-17T15:44:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But if you have that version when there are more cables its easier
[2023-04-17T15:45:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Its more shitty if you have flip
[2023-04-17T15:45:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If you have there button or and antispark swich ,you cant change to key safe for sure
[2023-04-17T15:46:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Buttons led eats rest after you are done
[2023-04-17T15:46:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And if only key there is like a minute while all has still power after key is even not in it
[2023-04-17T17:19:58] Ion: So how or what would I need to rewire? Key has 3 wires as far as I know, correct?
[2023-04-17T18:00:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: As i said there is more than one version
[2023-04-17T18:00:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You wire vesc button red to cut with the key switch side
[2023-04-17T18:02:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Screen to the battery,but this way screen Always shows voltage
[2023-04-17T18:02:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Unsure if you can Pick voltage from button
[2023-04-17T18:51:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You didn't fully understand
[2023-04-17T18:52:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: We dont connect screen to 5v forget that side ,just the key swich
[2023-04-17T18:53:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also this has dumb screen
[2023-04-17T18:53:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And you dont want any stock so you individual wire out for voltgate
[2023-04-17T18:53:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I give up
[2023-04-17T18:53:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What do you guys think
[2023-04-17T18:53:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Rewire
[2023-04-17T18:53:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Forget all shit wires it has
[2023-04-17T18:54:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You do new wiring
[2023-04-17T18:54:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: One for key switch one for the screen
[2023-04-17T18:54:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I am unsure that it has stable signal there
[2023-04-17T18:55:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: He can wire that direct on batt,but than he will have it non stop
[2023-04-17T18:55:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Consumes 0.3v
[2023-04-17T18:56:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also never tried to jump on vbat but i dont you can fuck that like this
[2023-04-17T18:56:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Unsure
[2023-04-17T18:56:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Sure
[2023-04-17T18:57:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Key just dissable
[2023-04-17T18:57:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: One wire off button so no power there till key
[2023-04-17T18:57:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So we were talking about same thing now as i see
[2023-04-17T18:57:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: ü§£
[2023-04-17T19:00:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also i on awd build earlier i didn't used shit screen coz had shunt mod That has it's own screen Voltgate and amps Measure on a huge shunt not a tiny joke like on any esc
[2023-04-17T19:00:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But dont use it now ,no time to look on screens‚Äå‚Äå Translation: en-hu De most ne haszn√°ld, nincs id≈ëd a k√©perny≈ëkbe n√©zni‚Äå‚Äå
[2023-04-17T19:09:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Francois bought it back in time ,you can see pics from that at the very start of this chat
[2023-04-17T19:09:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Even main pics is from that scoot
[2023-04-17T19:21:30] Ion: Ok, i think i understand what you are saying. 1. Wire key as the button (just for on/off) 2 wires 2. Wire the voltage meter separately (to battery) 2 wires. Maybe add a button to turn the voltmeter off. Also add a fuse for protection (full battery voltage on a small cable sounds dangerous lol)
[2023-04-17T19:31:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Will work
[2023-04-17T21:07:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Welcome

[2023-04-17T21:31:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: ü§£
[2023-04-17T21:32:07] Finn: my telegram is so empty....
[2023-04-17T21:32:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: No probs we are fast international criminalsü§£
[2023-04-17T21:33:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You already vesc do you?
[2023-04-17T21:34:08] Finn: yes video uploading..
[2023-04-17T21:34:18] Finn: Any thoughts? Got 1200W Motor with 16SüòÇ
[2023-04-17T21:34:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Saw one in your profile üòÅ
[2023-04-17T21:36:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Thoughts, depends on settings and stuff what you have
[2023-04-17T21:37:04] Finn: I really dont know if theres much potential to optimise my settings even more..
[2023-04-17T21:37:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: We know nothing from your settings
[2023-04-17T21:37:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also what vesc u have?
[2023-04-17T21:37:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: Small current
[2023-04-17T21:38:35] Finn: i set my phase to 130A. The 1200W Motor only consumes around 100-115
[2023-04-17T21:38:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: What battery current?
[2023-04-17T21:39:43] Finn: Around 80A Battery (100A normal 150A Peak)
[2023-04-17T21:40:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: I mean in vesc setting
[2023-04-17T21:43:03] Finn: I made a video.. Its uploading

[2023-04-17T21:45:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Interesting
[2023-04-17T21:45:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What motor is that ?
[2023-04-17T21:45:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: Same as your
[2023-04-17T21:45:27] Finn: 1200W blade motor from Paolo
[2023-04-17T21:46:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: Maybe set 170 phase , 100 batt and 40A field weakening
[2023-04-17T21:46:39] Finn: 170A Phase absolute maximum?
[2023-04-17T21:46:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I see ,looks slow a bit for that s and setting
[2023-04-17T21:47:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Phase current and max to 250
[2023-04-17T21:48:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What vesc you have ,still?
[2023-04-17T21:48:21] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: The fact that your acceleration is 3x as fast as mine, while I got so much more power than you... üòÖ
[2023-04-17T21:48:25] Finn: Flipsky 71500 with better MOSFTETS
[2023-04-17T21:48:38] Finn: I weight arround 60KG xD
[2023-04-17T21:48:48] Finn: maybe thats the advantage
[2023-04-17T21:49:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Interesting but Unsure how fancy can you go
[2023-04-17T21:49:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Try fw what Paolo said
[2023-04-17T21:49:55] Finn: i already set it to 40A
[2023-04-17T21:50:05] Finn: okay imma try 170A phase
[2023-04-17T21:50:11] Finn: lets go for a ride....xD
[2023-04-17T21:50:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes moore
[2023-04-17T21:51:03] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I put 185A on my 75100 Alu PCB
[2023-04-17T21:51:28] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but still acceleration like a truck
[2023-04-17T21:51:30] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: :(
[2023-04-17T21:51:49] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: not even burning out even tho front motor and shit
[2023-04-17T21:51:55] Finn: Lmao
[2023-04-17T21:52:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Truck üòÖüôà
[2023-04-17T21:52:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You may need india vesc powa
[2023-04-17T21:53:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also your weight would love an awd
[2023-04-17T21:53:42] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: To be fair, started at 60 with high wind resistance, but isn't really better on low speed.
[2023-04-17T21:53:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, hope AWD will bring the acceleration I need. But single blade was fine and spun a lot, but 60h sooo much slower
[2023-04-17T21:54:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Sounds fun
[2023-04-17T21:54:46] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and the poor quality of the 75100 Alu PCB still fuck me at high speed
[2023-04-17T21:54:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: There‚Äôs two type of 60h
[2023-04-17T21:54:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Awd is big game changer
[2023-04-17T21:55:11] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: my duty is going craazy
[2023-04-17T21:55:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: need to finally replace it
[2023-04-17T22:06:06] Finn: So @PaoloWu 170A absolute max or normal?
[2023-04-17T22:09:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Should be high kV, but 132km/h at 90v. Not suuure.
[2023-04-17T22:09:41] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, I use mxlemming
[2023-04-17T22:09:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It's great
[2023-04-17T22:09:50] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: no field weakening
[2023-04-17T22:10:16] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yup
[2023-04-17T22:10:27] Finn: Should be enough for a testride at 170A phase
[2023-04-17T22:11:04] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I will put them into dual anyway, but will test with more powerful VESC on single soon, want to see how far I can push it ;)
[2023-04-17T22:11:29] Finn: 16s4p Molicel 45A cells. Bms 100A 150APeak
[2023-04-17T22:11:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: If it's not great enough, I'll swap it out with normal kV motor or something.
[2023-04-17T22:11:47] Finn: Youre crazyüòÇ
[2023-04-17T22:12:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It handles it, somewhat.

[2023-04-17T22:12:40] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but it sucks

[2023-04-17T22:13:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: Oh yes x)
[2023-04-17T22:13:14] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Still couldn't figure out why Makerbase 75100 Alu PCB sucks so much at high speed.
[2023-04-17T22:13:23] Finn: What do you mean? A cut?
[2023-04-17T22:13:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: üòÇ
[2023-04-17T22:13:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: 80H I never tested
[2023-04-17T22:13:55] sombre_enfant: Battery disconnect on acceleration
[2023-04-17T22:14:34] Finn: Huh?
[2023-04-17T22:14:56] sombre_enfant: I'll use llt 100A very soon on my build i ask since i had this issue ago with Ant 80A
[2023-04-17T22:15:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: I really don't know, I guess around 300A battery maybe a little less
[2023-04-17T22:15:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, same issue.
[2023-04-17T22:15:39] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Nothing works.
[2023-04-17T22:15:46] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes clearly haha
[2023-04-17T22:16:00] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Nope
[2023-04-17T22:16:03] Face de Pin Suc√©: Any news of your build ? @jamessoderstrom üòÅüòÅ
[2023-04-17T22:16:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Really annoying to debug this issue when you have to always go 80km/h to test it.
[2023-04-17T22:17:04] Finn: <photos/photo_8127@17-04-2023_22-17-04.jpg>
[2023-04-17T22:17:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: more absolute maximum current

[2023-04-17T22:19:28] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: now I use old phone for display
[2023-04-17T22:19:37] Finn: Hm
[2023-04-17T22:19:43] Finn: Doesnt do any difference
[2023-04-17T22:19:49] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but Xiaomi Display is good enough :)
[2023-04-17T22:19:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: wdym no difference
[2023-04-17T22:20:03] Finn: 120A phase max

[2023-04-17T22:23:08] sombre_enfant: Io hawk display üôèüèæüôèüèæ
[2023-04-17T22:23:35] Finn: <video_file>
[2023-04-17T22:25:23] Finn: I dont really have an issue. Just wanted to know if theres any optimisation i can do to the settings. Im thinking i reached the limit on my build
[2023-04-17T22:26:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Enough to overtake any other German on the meet.
[2023-04-17T22:26:32] Finn: Thats for sureüòÇüòÇ
[2023-04-17T22:27:03] Face de Pin Suc√©: Can be locked at 20Kmh, and you put a sticker rage mechanics on your scooter and says it's original 500W haha
[2023-04-17T22:27:24] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Only got 2 1/2 months left to fully build my g30
[2023-04-17T22:27:25] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: shit
[2023-04-17T22:28:35] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: have a 500w/800w Paolo Motor In my opinion, this is the true stealth engine for a Ninebot :)
[2023-04-17T22:29:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nobody wants that i guess üòÅ
[2023-04-17T22:29:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but that ?
[2023-04-17T22:30:53] Finn: Oh never tried that before
[2023-04-17T22:30:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: That might interest me
[2023-04-17T22:31:45] sombre_enfant: Seems great enough on empty battery i was doing same with dual same motor/controller/weight but poor 16s... how u cool the flipsky tho ?
[2023-04-17T22:32:13] Finn: Its mounted on the scooter frame
[2023-04-17T22:32:31] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: I like your project a lot, believe me, but that's just what most people want and where we Germans in particular would also spend moneyü´£
[2023-04-17T22:32:45] sombre_enfant: Tu va faire une g30üòÇ
[2023-04-17T22:34:07] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Needs to be working at least till 25.06, so I got enough time to tweak things for the meet. I think my biggest issue is going to be removing the mounting thingies inside the g30 frame. Planned is 20S6P with Moli P42A, I also need to get a metal bottom plate, but hopefully @LizardDoggo can help me out. Cells I can order next month, only need to decide which BMS I go for, if I take the JK 20S 200A or go with LTT 100A...
[2023-04-17T22:34:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes
[2023-04-17T22:34:57] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, I have no idea how I am going to remove them üòÖ
[2023-04-17T22:35:24] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Saw people doing it with proper tools like mill soo easy, but I don't have such fancy tools.
[2023-04-17T22:35:49] sombre_enfant: Dremel is possible but lot of sweat
[2023-04-17T22:35:54] Unknown: Do you have a drill press or hand drill
[2023-04-17T22:36:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No
[2023-04-17T22:36:14] Mirono escooters: Lol i saw grinding disk
[2023-04-17T22:36:23] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, probably the tool I am going to use...
[2023-04-17T22:36:28] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Don't know anything else.
[2023-04-17T22:36:33] Mirono escooters: Mill go brt
[2023-04-17T22:36:39] Mirono escooters: U got no school or uni with it?
[2023-04-17T22:36:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No
[2023-04-17T22:36:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: At least not that I could access it.
[2023-04-17T22:37:02] Mirono escooters: You can always ask
[2023-04-17T22:37:04] sombre_enfant: 100mm rotary tool with rock

[2023-04-17T22:37:53] sombre_enfant: Even with mill if u dont have right fixture and table in the shop it can be hard
[2023-04-17T22:37:59] Unknown: Rock would clog need burr bit but take forever
[2023-04-17T22:38:10] Mirono escooters: Eh, true
[2023-04-17T22:38:14] Mirono escooters: But still easier then hand
[2023-04-17T22:39:24] Unknown: What tools do you own a üî® and ü™õ
[2023-04-17T22:39:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Dremel, hammer, screw driver, power drill uhm well that's it
[2023-04-17T22:40:14] sombre_enfant: This but need to drill the frame and screw a round as fixture to hold it in spindle, more ghetto but easiest
[2023-04-17T22:40:14] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_8134@17-04-2023_22-40-14.jpg>
[2023-04-17T22:41:24] Unknown: Drill out most material you can, then use Dremel with rotary burr
[2023-04-17T22:42:29] Unknown: It's aluminum could use a router with a long bit lol.
[2023-04-17T22:42:53] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_8135@17-04-2023_22-42-53.jpg>
[2023-04-17T22:43:13] sombre_enfant: Prob is the neck of the frame...
[2023-04-17T22:44:27] Unknown: Remove bulk material then grind. Grinder alone take a year. My pic I used drill press, neck hung over table
[2023-04-17T22:46:44] Unknown: Mabey a carbide forstner bit and some aluminum tapping spray
[2023-04-17T22:47:07] Unknown: I used regular metal bit but had stability of drill press
[2023-04-17T23:34:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: hehe
[2023-04-17T23:34:57] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes I need to know which motor I can put xDDDD
[2023-04-17T23:50:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well ,lot things can happen,your drill shit ,bits shitty Like buy cobalt does eat
[2023-04-17T23:51:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I am unsure in english but its not really like a drill bit made for cnc machines
[2023-04-17T23:52:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also without that machine its impossible to hold that
[2023-04-18T05:00:20] sombre_enfant: Yours 60mm high speed 10" without any mod on frame or fork
[2023-04-18T06:52:39] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes I know it was a joke for James üòÅ
[2023-04-18T12:25:17] S1m 0n: Does the spinted single box make sense in a Xiomi/Ninebot? It offers only 1x RX/TX... So either display connection or Bluetttoh function ü§î
[2023-04-18T12:28:02] S1m 0n: The version with integrated Bluetttoh makes more sense. What about Camible? He wanted to take care of the Bluetttoh of the Mi/Ninebot dashboards a year ago?!
[2023-04-18T12:28:35] S1m 0n: Has there been any further development?
[2023-04-18T12:31:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, you are supposed to use NRF on Spintend. It is the same like UART2 basically on the Flipsky VESCs.
[2023-04-18T12:31:23] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It's just different naming
[2023-04-18T12:54:17] S1m 0n: My colleague who scraped the Flipsky 75100 non Alu, 75100 Alu and 75200 Alu in a short time, now has the Ubox Single but has bought the version without Bluetttoh, so I asked üòÑ
[2023-04-18T12:57:22] S1m 0n: Thanks ü§¥
[2023-04-18T13:14:30] Ion: For the people who use the spintend ADC V2 Adapter. How did you do turn signals, rear lights, brake lights etc?
[2023-04-18T15:39:40] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Ouch
[2023-04-18T15:46:15] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No idea
[2023-04-18T15:46:38] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Did not open any of the 60H yet.
[2023-04-18T15:46:57] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But well, definitely nothing for Single, only took 13km at 40km/h to overheat.
[2023-04-18T15:47:30] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Need to use Statorade on them. Maybe it helps, but argh opening motors sucks
[2023-04-18T15:53:31] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No idea how my Blade worked so well under these conditions (To be fair, no temp sensor), can't believe that the 60h heats up so much. At which point the temperature is not good for the motor? I would like to increase it at least few ¬∞C higher...
[2023-04-18T15:53:40] Mirono escooters: Only have to remove cover
[2023-04-18T15:53:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: For Statorade?
[2023-04-18T15:54:00] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I always took out the stator to apply.
[2023-04-18T15:57:23] Mirono escooters: Why would u
[2023-04-18T15:57:35] Mirono escooters: That sucks
[2023-04-18T15:57:48] Mirono escooters: There's even tutorial to drill in cover üíÄ
[2023-04-18T16:02:13] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: what
[2023-04-18T16:02:16] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: drill in cover?
[2023-04-18T16:03:00] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-04-18T16:03:04] Mirono escooters: Drill hole
[2023-04-18T16:03:21] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: What do you mean drill hole
[2023-04-18T16:03:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: What
[2023-04-18T16:03:31] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I don't want holes in my motor
[2023-04-18T16:03:33] Mirono escooters: Yes to squirt ff in
[2023-04-18T16:03:37] Mirono escooters: I don't say y should
[2023-04-18T16:03:42] Mirono escooters: I say tutorial existüíÄ
[2023-04-18T16:03:49] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: üòê
[2023-04-18T16:04:03] Mirono escooters: Just remove cover and squirt in sides
[2023-04-18T16:04:04] Mirono escooters: Ez
[2023-04-18T16:04:10] Mirono escooters: I wasn't gonna remove my ebike stator
[2023-04-18T16:04:15] Mirono escooters: That thing is humungus strong
[2023-04-18T16:06:23] S1m 0n: Simply drill through a hole for the brake disc
[2023-04-18T16:06:59] S1m 0n: But I do not like the method because it is too inaccurate üòÑ
[2023-04-18T16:07:25] Mirono escooters: XD yes
[2023-04-18T16:07:27] Mirono escooters: Have to guess
[2023-04-18T17:19:14] Jan: Dont yet, something else is fucked up. Something doesnt add up for me in your system
[2023-04-18T17:19:32] Jan: 60h is quite the motor and should easily reach 100kph
[2023-04-18T17:20:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Still blade is high kV too, or not?
[2023-04-18T17:20:48] Jan: Higher than vsett10+
[2023-04-18T17:20:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: No
[2023-04-18T17:21:07] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Thought so, okay
[2023-04-18T17:21:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: Depends by comparing to what
[2023-04-18T17:21:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: More than m365 motor sure

[2023-04-18T19:04:45] sombre_enfant: U seems real good on Solidworks if u did with exact size as the original, what mesurement tool u use to copy real part ?
[2023-04-18T19:05:38] Quinn Foster: $5 calipers
[2023-04-18T19:05:48] Quinn Foster: eye eye
[2023-04-18T19:15:50] sombre_enfant: How about the radius chamfer etc ?
[2023-04-18T19:17:06] Simone: @SibClimb do u test the sonken disk?
[2023-04-18T19:17:41] Quinn Foster: eyeball then 3d print cross section and refine. Which I skipped only checked the bolt pattern to mount adapter plate
[2023-04-18T19:18:01] Quinn Foster: I am wondering what sprocket size standard possibly exists that I would want to use...
[2023-04-18T19:18:22] Quinn Foster: Looking for a bolt pattern like 100mm or something
[2023-04-18T20:41:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: Not yet
[2023-04-18T20:46:49] Simone: do you know if they are hardened and ground?
[2023-04-19T07:17:47] Gigolo Joe: Dremel
[2023-04-19T12:11:20] Face de Pin Suc√©: Hello guys, does someone know where I could find a Vesctool capable to read 3.102 firmware ?

[2023-04-19T15:46:04] Gordan Gizdic: Works awesome if someone needs a tool like this.
[2023-04-19T15:46:09] Gordan Gizdic: Dead accurate and fast.
[2023-04-19T15:46:11] Mirono escooters: Is cool stuff
[2023-04-19T15:46:53] Gordan Gizdic: Will ohm match cells for batt pack so i need to be able to quickly and accurately measure them.
[2023-04-19T15:47:00] Gordan Gizdic: Thing thing does both great.
[2023-04-19T15:47:19] Gordan Gizdic: This thing*
[2023-04-19T16:26:31] gil guy: I don't thi.k . It measure AC value . We need DC value.
[2023-04-19T16:26:52] Mirono escooters: Its 1khz ac
[2023-04-19T16:27:07] Mirono escooters: Widely used as universal standard They haven't decided how the DC standard should be measured
[2023-04-19T16:27:14] Mirono escooters: So yes, its fine to match cells with it
[2023-04-19T16:27:43] Gordan Gizdic: I use it to check for differences and that works good.
[2023-04-19T16:28:00] Gordan Gizdic: And nah, its not DC, its 1khz ac
[2023-04-19T16:29:30] Konstantin: Y, some ppl use 0.5...2.5apm load to calculate it... And exist few Algo to calculate it...
[2023-04-19T16:36:03] Mirono escooters: They just can't agree on it
[2023-04-19T16:36:04] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2023-04-19T16:57:47] gil guy: For a good accuracy dc resistance measure, you must send or drain at least 1A . With an electronic load or power supply limited @1A . Voltage drop in mV is your resistance in mOhms
[2023-04-19T16:58:17] Mirono escooters: Yes, basic ohms law, but there are no universal agreements on it
[2023-04-19T16:58:20] Mirono escooters: Ac 1khz is
[2023-04-19T16:58:31] Mirono escooters: Also quicker . Easier
[2023-04-19T17:00:11] gil guy: Ac value is generally lower than DC .. and unfortunally not proportional..
[2023-04-19T17:02:51] Mirono escooters: Yes, its almost always lower. But. It still gives a good idea and reference
[2023-04-19T17:43:27] Finn: Testride on full battery

[2023-04-19T22:17:56] Finn: arround 10-15kg
[2023-04-19T22:17:59] rosheee: he works for fapsky?
[2023-04-19T22:18:08] rosheee: ah ok
[2023-04-19T22:18:37] Jake: Yeah, there is both a regular and no limit firmware for this
[2023-04-19T22:18:50] Jake: and a modified version that tires to get rid of some of the noise
[2023-04-19T22:19:27] Jake: Try this one first - https://github.com/vedderb/vesc_fw_archive/tree/main/6.02/FSESC_75_200_ALU
[2023-04-19T22:19:41] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Something like this? Experiencing this with Makerbase 75100 Alu PCB and couldn't solve it. :/
[2023-04-19T22:20:13] Oreo huzky: I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs that but it feels like that when it stutters
[2023-04-19T22:20:27] rosheee: this pretty normal ^^' i guess
[2023-04-19T22:20:30] rosheee: had it with all vescs
[2023-04-19T22:20:32] rosheee: until HFI XD
[2023-04-19T22:21:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No, this is much worse than normal.
[2023-04-19T22:21:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, I have the log here. Can send it here.
[2023-04-19T22:21:53] Jake: Been talking to a guy who has a pair of these on some 63100 motors attached to a buggy of sorts. Ran like crap with both the Flipsky and the hacked firmware, but ran well with this firmware, where it tries to get rid of noise. He hasn't tested it above 80% duty yet, but it was super smooth so far
[2023-04-19T22:21:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 2023-04-15_21-25-21.csv
[2023-04-19T22:22:19] Jake: <files/fsesc_75_200_alu_sample2 (1).bin>
[2023-04-19T22:22:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: The weird thing is that vd and vq are totally stable, as well as vbus. So there has to be another reason why it fluctuates like this.
[2023-04-19T22:23:40] Oreo huzky: I will try it and tell you about the results
[2023-04-19T22:24:07] Jake: Basically the 75200 has hardware problems haha
[2023-04-19T22:24:29] Jake: Yeah, both versions are
[2023-04-19T22:24:45] rosheee: <photos/photo_8149@19-04-2023_22-24-45.jpg>
[2023-04-19T22:25:40] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes absolutely ass üòÇ
[2023-04-19T22:25:52] Jake: Yeah I'm pretty sure he's the one who helped me with some voltage calculations a while back so I think he's got it :)
[2023-04-19T22:26:28] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, it was me.
[2023-04-19T22:26:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: talking to mxlemming about it already, he had an idea, but I still have to try it.
[2023-04-19T22:28:10] Jake: Could also try the 75200 sample firmware above. Should basically be the same, just higher limits. Take it step by step when testing at high duty cycles though. Still not sure if it will work great or not at all
[2023-04-19T22:28:12] Jan: Your duty cycle lol, did you check throttle input?
[2023-04-19T22:28:51] rosheee: motor temp lol
[2023-04-19T22:29:03] rosheee: dis not good ^^'
[2023-04-19T22:29:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Modifying the foc code at the saturation and anti windup parts üò® but hmm, need to test it...
[2023-04-19T22:29:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yeah
[2023-04-19T22:30:26] rosheee: put lower values
[2023-04-19T22:30:38] rosheee: can u send XML of your settings teh pls?
[2023-04-19T22:30:46] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: doesn't help, it will overheat anyway if you mean the temps
[2023-04-19T22:33:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: hmm throttle input, no, did not check. I will check it tomorrow, could be a good reason, but it should be filtered enough, but we'll see..
[2023-04-19T22:34:06] Oreo huzky: Uploaded it but it looks like old firmware is still on the device
[2023-04-19T22:34:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Higher limits of what exactly?
[2023-04-19T22:35:10] Oreo huzky: Before I had 6.00 no he limit
[2023-04-19T22:35:39] Oreo huzky: Will do
[2023-04-19T22:36:15] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Its because you use different vesc tool software version than firmware version on esc
[2023-04-19T22:36:29] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You must use same version of vesc tool as fw on esc
[2023-04-19T22:36:35] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 6.0 fw -> 6.0 vesc tool
[2023-04-19T22:36:41] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 6.2 - 6.02 etc
[2023-04-19T22:36:44] Jake: Bootloader changed after 5.03, and some ESCs don't ship with it. Updating the firmware updates the bootloader, unless you use the custom file option. Then it doesn't and you would need to flash it manually.
[2023-04-19T22:37:11] Jake: It's just a tab in the tool though, so pretty easy
[2023-04-19T22:37:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <files/makerbase_75100_alu_60h_hallsensors>
[2023-04-19T22:39:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes won't make any difference, tried everything already, every observer, every bemf that could maybe affect the duty, but after reviewing the code it shouldn't do much anyway, also duty current limiter to smooth out (made me almost flip off the scooter), higher duty limit and shit
[2023-04-19T22:40:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: only thing I can now try is modifying the foc code with the help from mxlemming
[2023-04-19T22:40:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yup
[2023-04-19T22:41:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: from 16 to 32, was running 20 for most of the time, went up to 30/32 now because of the motor temps
[2023-04-19T22:41:12] Oreo huzky: Now
[2023-04-19T22:41:31] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No idea, people seem to have similarish issues, but nothing exactly the same.
[2023-04-19T22:41:33] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: what about shielding adc wire?
[2023-04-19T22:41:40] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: there is no ADC wire
[2023-04-19T22:41:52] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: only data which is CRC checked
[2023-04-19T22:42:00] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: ADC is handled far far far away from esc
[2023-04-19T22:42:04] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: How your throttle goes to vesc then?
[2023-04-19T22:42:18] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Comm port
[2023-04-19T22:42:25] sombre_enfant: Ye
[2023-04-19T22:42:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: UART, it's being sent by display
[2023-04-19T22:43:18] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Uart is very sensitive to noise
[2023-04-19T22:43:24] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: When high currents
[2023-04-19T22:43:44] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: CAN isnt sensitive
[2023-04-19T22:44:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Try to shield wires to comm port
[2023-04-19T22:44:10] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, but it won't affect this at all. It might drop a packet, but it immediately gets a new one.
[2023-04-19T22:44:16] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: To minimize noise
[2023-04-19T22:44:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I would see this on display
[2023-04-19T22:44:21] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: If it drops anything
[2023-04-19T22:45:01] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But still, tomorrow I will display throttle data on display to make sure it's really no throttle issue.
[2023-04-19T22:45:16] rosheee: ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2023-04-19T22:46:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, I think that would be an option, but if it cannot even handle the duty correctly, how bad is it when it starts fucking up HFI tracking? üòÖ
[2023-04-19T22:46:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but will try it nothing helps
[2023-04-19T22:47:30] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Hfi only works on start like halls
[2023-04-19T22:47:33] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: No?
[2023-04-19T22:47:46] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: He set the rpm end to sky
[2023-04-19T22:47:52] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Holy
[2023-04-19T22:48:39] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: hmm, not sure, I got another one to try, but it's a temporary solution anyway until I get the new VESC in it.
[2023-04-19T22:49:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No xd
[2023-04-19T22:53:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I just need my cells to build battery for g30 but nkon ships P42A early next month.. (and still need to actually order them)
[2023-04-19T22:54:27] Finn: Molicel out of stock?
[2023-04-19T22:54:29] Finn: Damn
[2023-04-19T22:54:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: need to end my suffering with single motor üòÇ (will keep my pro2 tho for guests)
[2023-04-19T22:54:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, not available at the moment. You can only pre-order right now.
[2023-04-19T22:55:06] Finn: Wanted to build 4s4p maybe for my pro2
[2023-04-19T22:55:17] Finn: Does any high current bms exist for 4s?
[2023-04-19T22:55:55] Finn: And does the flipsky even supports 20s
[2023-04-19T22:56:00] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 4s... well, llt 100a BMS should support it
[2023-04-19T22:56:04] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes of course
[2023-04-19T22:56:40] Finn: Will it improve speed? Or did i reach the limit with the 1200W motor
[2023-04-19T22:56:58] Finn: Bc my duty is arround 95-96%
[2023-04-19T22:57:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: limit no, push it till it's grilled
[2023-04-19T22:58:01] Finn: My wire were really wobbly after i drove with my friend together on one scooterüòÇüòÇ
[2023-04-19T22:58:23] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yeah, wire will be the first thing to burn on it. üòÖ
[2023-04-19T22:58:49] Finn: I hope my cooling should be enough for this wattage
[2023-04-19T22:58:58] Finn: I mean it stays pretty cool with the mosfets
[2023-04-19T23:00:00] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But your 16S is already doing pretty good, not sure if 20S will improve this, never had the actual chance to fully test my 22S without any issues. Ubox Single overheated immediately Makerbase 75100 Alu duty fucked at 80km/h+ üòÇ
[2023-04-19T23:00:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I am way too slow for my voltage
[2023-04-19T23:00:39] Finn: I mean more voltage = more speed
[2023-04-19T23:00:45] Finn: Selfmade vesc
[2023-04-19T23:00:48] Finn: üòà
[2023-04-19T23:01:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes on my table, but fuck mounting and me and metal and üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
[2023-04-19T23:01:22] Finn: Send it to me
[2023-04-19T23:01:27] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I pray to @Mirono_escooters
[2023-04-19T23:01:31] Finn: And ill send you the bottom plate with
[2023-04-19T23:01:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: for saving me from this situation
[2023-04-19T23:02:15] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: You think you can drill the 18 holes so accurate that it will work?
[2023-04-19T23:02:27] Finn: Its not that hardüòÇ
[2023-04-19T23:02:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: OK OK
[2023-04-19T23:02:35] Finn: Just a little bit of concentratin
[2023-04-19T23:02:38] Finn: Xd
[2023-04-19T23:02:39] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: OK
[2023-04-19T23:03:07] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I will send you everything. Tomorrow.

[2023-04-20T16:19:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And mainly its just parts
[2023-04-21T16:41:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: razy how much difference there is between outer shell and motor inside.
[2023-04-21T16:41:36] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <photos/photo_8153@21-04-2023_16-41-36.jpg>
[2023-04-21T16:50:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Did you ferrofluid it already?
[2023-04-21T16:50:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: will do in the next days
[2023-04-21T16:50:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because the only conductor from stator to cover is the inside air, and bearings
[2023-04-21T16:50:42] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: want to record before and after, would be neat to have
[2023-04-21T16:51:10] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: people always ask me how much difference it makes, but cannot really give them anything to show üòÇ
[2023-04-21T16:51:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: The biggest difference will be when the motor has air flow
[2023-04-21T16:52:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: Technically copper can be cooled quickly
[2023-04-21T16:52:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: But not if there‚Äôs no escape for hot air
[2023-04-21T16:55:51] Mirono escooters: Air is shitty conductor, and if air gap is something in motor, it sucks
[2023-04-21T16:56:03] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @Mirono_escooters going to tell me to drill holes again, please not üòÇ I need cover from dirt.

[2023-04-21T21:00:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: Many times
[2023-04-21T21:00:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: üëå
[2023-04-21T21:01:14] Face de Pin Suc√©: I opened every motors I think
[2023-04-21T21:01:26] Mirko Boni: Can you disassemble the 60H engine? I didn't succeed..
[2023-04-21T21:01:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You need to remove ring than it must even if its not easy
[2023-04-21T21:01:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: But it's not the easiest thing on those motors I have to admit
[2023-04-21T21:01:46] Mirko Boni: Exactly üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-04-21T21:01:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Or need to use viseüòè

[2023-04-21T21:02:13] Mirko Boni: Exactly.. Impossible to disassemble .. Wtf
[2023-04-21T21:04:42] Mirko Boni: I used spray grease.. But I didn't succeed
[2023-04-21T21:06:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: No grease needed
[2023-04-21T21:07:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Remove simmering Ads contact spray to hole ,let it work
[2023-04-21T21:07:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You need to loose rtv silicone
[2023-04-21T21:08:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If you do soüëÜ bearings need to be changed,since you wash out the grease a probably
[2023-04-21T21:08:17] Mirko Boni: The silicon?
[2023-04-21T21:08:44] Mirko Boni: I used lithium spray grease.. It doesn't wash out the grease from the bearings
[2023-04-21T21:09:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You were pretty far from opening
[2023-04-21T21:10:28] Mirko Boni: Absolutely yes.. Far away üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-04-21T21:10:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Hole filled partly with rtv silicone, that waterproof cable
[2023-04-21T21:11:06] Mirko Boni: In fact I closed the engine.. I gave up
[2023-04-21T21:11:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also never spray anything on a bearing bro
[2023-04-21T21:11:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If its spray it has something what makes you able to spray
[2023-04-21T21:13:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like the lazy way is the spray version off grease
[2023-04-21T21:13:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Not to mention Some of these ment to get in all gaps
[2023-04-21T21:21:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But to open shit like this you need the tools and the how to not make damage
[2023-04-21T21:36:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like Always
[2023-04-21T21:38:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: When there is only one side is no easier ,but all can be opened

[2023-04-22T17:45:12] Oreo huzky: Hey has anyone some experience with these types of controllers
[2023-04-22T17:47:46] Mirono escooters: Shite
[2023-04-22T17:47:49] Mirono escooters: Big
[2023-04-22T17:49:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: Good for wire melting
[2023-04-22T18:00:32] Oreo huzky: Why to much power?
[2023-04-22T18:00:49] Oreo huzky: If it‚Äôs better than flipsky it works
[2023-04-22T18:10:57] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2023-04-22T18:41:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: Uncontrolled current , not too much power
[2023-04-22T18:41:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: Mean a waste of energy and causing instability at start
[2023-04-22T18:46:33] Oreo huzky: Okay didn‚Äôt dukaz used such controllers?
[2023-04-22T18:47:31] Mirono escooters: So?
[2023-04-22T18:48:52] Oreo huzky: I just thought it‚Äôs good when he used it maybe a dumb thought
[2023-04-22T18:50:02] Mirono escooters: They are not super effici√´nt and big
[2023-04-22T18:50:05] Mirono escooters: Its :/
[2023-04-22T18:50:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: 7280 (80A) vs Kelly 7218 (80A)
[2023-04-22T18:51:29] Mirono escooters: The size of cheap china controllers are so jezus
[2023-04-22T18:51:30] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-04-22T18:51:34] Mirono escooters: High heating
[2023-04-22T18:53:36] Oreo huzky: Isn‚Äôt it better for cooling?
[2023-04-22T18:55:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: How do you like these cells?
[2023-04-22T18:55:39] Oreo huzky: Or is it possible to mount flipsky 75200 different because mine always brake when I drive over bump and I even padded the second one with a bit of foam and that think also broke my bms
[2023-04-22T18:56:10] Mirono escooters: Guud
[2023-04-22T18:56:26] Mirono escooters: Dont need cooling if not much heat
[2023-04-22T18:56:34] Mirono escooters: Buy diff
[2023-04-22T18:56:39] Oreo huzky: Ah
[2023-04-22T18:56:51] Oreo huzky: Yes but what if they brake too
[2023-04-22T18:57:01] Mirono escooters: Shouldn't
[2023-04-22T18:59:15] Mirono escooters: Same
[2023-04-22T19:09:59] Oreo huzky: Well I used double sided tape but it was the expensive one with foam in it and it‚Äôs really strong
[2023-04-22T19:10:32] Oreo huzky: Didnt
[2023-04-22T19:10:42] Oreo huzky: It only overheated once
[2023-04-22T19:11:34] Oreo huzky: It had big heatsink
[2023-04-22T19:11:48] Oreo huzky: And I was driving casual no hard load
[2023-04-22T19:12:21] Oreo huzky: Yea 75200 has heatsink
[2023-04-22T19:12:35] Oreo huzky: And alu pcb
[2023-04-22T19:24:55] Oreo huzky: You can pull the vesc from heatsink but it‚Äôs attached strongly I couldn‚Äôt get it off
[2023-04-22T19:25:37] Oreo huzky: Okay
[2023-04-22T20:59:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I nuked something

[2023-04-22T21:04:24] Mirono escooters: Oh no
[2023-04-22T21:04:34] Mirono escooters: Babe 1zuna broke something again wake up
[2023-04-22T21:04:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: this time being picked up luckily
[2023-04-22T21:05:48] Mirono escooters: Huh
[2023-04-22T21:05:54] Mirono escooters: Ohh. No walking

[2023-04-22T21:06:34] Mirono escooters: How what broke
[2023-04-22T21:07:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: no idea motor going into full brake and uhm, yeah resistance when spinning but it feels different this time.
[2023-04-22T21:07:36] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but maybe cuz different motor, need to get home to check if MOSFETs or something else
[2023-04-22T21:08:35] Mirono escooters: Rip
[2023-04-22T21:11:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: What VESC and what settings ?
[2023-04-22T21:19:16] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Makerbase 75100 Alu PCB, worked well, now went from 175A phase to 185A and rip? üòÇ
[2023-04-22T21:28:46] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's a lot for a 6 FET x) do you have the fets reference ?
[2023-04-22T21:36:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: Okay x)
[2023-04-22T21:42:39] Finn: i never had any problems. Maybe because i only push arround 115A phase through xDDD
[2023-04-22T21:43:43] Finn: my friend said when he drove with full throttle he got a power loss for like 50ms where battery peaked at 92A
[2023-04-22T21:44:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes exactly, when pulling very low power, never problem on VESC
[2023-04-22T21:44:41] Finn: soon when my 16 cells are arriving then 82V finally. Hopefully i get better results when it comes to speed
[2023-04-22T21:45:16] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: need more power.
[2023-04-22T21:45:25] Finn: you need more power??
[2023-04-22T21:45:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yes üò≠
[2023-04-22T21:45:42] Finn: to burn the mosfets more efficient?
[2023-04-22T21:45:48] Finn: what about your vesc
[2023-04-22T21:46:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: you know, heatsink, everything else no problem ü´§
[2023-04-22T21:46:20] Face de Pin Suc√©: Then go for 3Shul üòÅ
[2023-04-22T21:47:00] Finn: yep with 16 mosfets there shouldnt be a problem then with mosfets but the wires to the motor idk how long they will last then xD
[2023-04-22T21:47:44] Finn: Later you need that cable to power your little motorüòÇ
[2023-04-22T21:48:18] Finn: sry i meant 18
[2023-04-22T21:48:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: nah will be fine I think.
[2023-04-22T21:48:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 185A was pretty good, think I'll be satisfied again with ~200A
[2023-04-22T21:49:09] Finn: bro wtf
[2023-04-22T21:49:15] Finn: youtube hello???

[2023-04-23T13:24:08] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-04-23T13:24:19] Mirono escooters: First it just jumped between the set v and slowly dropping
[2023-04-23T13:24:33] Mirono escooters: Now the led is flikkering and dropping close to 0. Ticking on it sometimes makes the contact
[2023-04-23T13:24:40] Mirono escooters: I'm opening it to see if it's just a loose wire.
[2023-04-23T13:24:51] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_8174@23-04-2023_13-24-51.jpg>

[2023-04-23T13:25:15] Mirono escooters: Quality, questionable
[2023-04-23T13:26:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: By stock yes
[2023-04-23T13:27:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: If modified is different
[2023-04-23T13:27:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: Also these chargers are used much much years then resold and modified to these chargers
[2023-04-23T13:27:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: They aren‚Äôt brand new
[2023-04-23T13:29:31] Mirono escooters: Can't see anything off
[2023-04-23T13:30:12] Mirono escooters: Its something with the PSU itself not their added circuit
[2023-04-23T13:30:19] Mirono escooters: Since the led doesn't shine
[2023-04-23T13:30:21] Mirono escooters: Sigh
[2023-04-23T13:31:58] Mirono escooters: It isn't even that old, nor used frequently
[2023-04-23T13:33:31] Mirono escooters: Nop
[2023-04-23T13:34:03] Mirono escooters: Now I'm without charger for bike

[2023-04-23T13:40:06] Mirono escooters: A bad contact somewhere, because sometimes when I move him it works
[2023-04-23T13:42:54] Mirono escooters: No, main psu
[2023-04-23T13:42:58] Mirono escooters: Led isn't leding
[2023-04-23T13:43:49] Mirono escooters: That isn't super special
[2023-04-23T13:44:09] Mirono escooters: Yes

[2023-04-23T13:49:30] Mirono escooters: Cool, now just go through a Rabbit Hole to figure out where it came from
[2023-04-23T14:02:09] Mirono escooters: Cool found a heatshrink and a cold solder joint
[2023-04-23T14:03:23] Mirono escooters: Nop, not fixed.

[2023-04-23T14:11:45] Mirono escooters: Wondering if it died when 1 of the 2 ac wires disconnected? It was still on. Lol
[2023-04-23T14:30:02] Mirono escooters: Are there any better ones on market? I don't trust this seller anymore
[2023-04-23T14:31:10] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-04-23T14:31:12] Mirono escooters: Wich?

[2023-04-23T14:37:03] Mirono escooters: Wondering why it had a bad contact but I can't find it. When I moved it or hit it it would work rofl
[2023-04-23T14:38:58] Mirono escooters: Wow. Its based on a meanwell psu
[2023-04-23T14:39:02] Mirono escooters: Those are usually super reliable
[2023-04-23T14:46:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: I have 120v 30A version , paid 220 shipped, but super reliableü•≤
[2023-04-23T14:46:47] Mirono escooters: 220‚Ç¨ is quite alot for me

[2023-04-23T15:14:35] Mirono escooters: Cool the led began to shine and now I've made "lekstroom"
[2023-04-23T15:14:35] Mirono escooters: Power to earth
[2023-04-23T15:14:39] Mirono escooters: Not, lol
[2023-04-23T15:15:01] Mirono escooters: Nop
[2023-04-23T15:15:19] Mirono escooters: Stupid breaker
[2023-04-23T15:15:38] Mirono escooters: Ive tripped it
[2023-04-23T15:15:53] Mirono escooters: I plugged it in, led shined, then power went out
[2023-04-23T15:16:05] Mirono escooters: Rcd
[2023-04-23T15:16:28] Mirono escooters: God knows why tho
[2023-04-23T15:16:52] Mirono escooters: Oh it works now
[2023-04-23T15:16:54] Mirono escooters: Lol

[2023-04-23T15:17:02] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-04-23T15:17:22] Mirono escooters: Engineering I hit it with a rubber hammer It works Breaker trip Now works
[2023-04-23T15:17:31] Mirono escooters: I think I burned through whatever dead component stopped it from working.
[2023-04-23T15:18:34] Mirono escooters: I'm on it
[2023-04-23T15:18:45] Mirono escooters: Well, hope that doesn't trip the rcd
[2023-04-23T15:18:48] Mirono escooters: I'll ground casing
[2023-04-23T15:29:20] Mirono escooters: And it died againg
[2023-04-23T15:29:21] Mirono escooters: Sigh
[2023-04-23T15:32:29] Mirono escooters: Ready for the trash
[2023-04-23T15:32:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs from zte2400
[2023-04-23T15:32:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: Working continuously 2400w at 48v
[2023-04-23T15:34:31] Mirono escooters: Casing was already grounded.
[2023-04-23T15:34:34] Mirono escooters: Now I'm totally lost
[2023-04-23T15:35:33] Mirono escooters: Well it must trip the breaker BCS of that
[2023-04-23T15:35:39] Mirono escooters: Some component put 230v on it lol
[2023-04-23T15:39:39] Mirono escooters: Ok no it's totally dead. Found what was shorting. Now ded
[2023-04-23T15:39:43] Mirono escooters: Cool, ready for garbage
[2023-04-23T15:39:50] Mirono escooters: I'll charge 16s w 15s
[2023-04-23T15:42:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: I had break up circuit
[2023-04-23T15:42:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because they are no made for pre charge function , or diode
[2023-04-23T15:42:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: So it makes spark when you connect battery (if you don‚Äôt turn on first the charger) , m
[2023-04-23T15:43:44] Mirono escooters: Guess Ill not cheap out and get a sturdy one
[2023-04-23T15:44:19] Mirono escooters: God knows
[2023-04-23T15:44:22] Mirono escooters: Their shitty addon circuit
[2023-04-23T15:44:28] Mirono escooters: Wich was just loose inside
[2023-04-23T15:44:32] Mirono escooters: 80‚Ç¨ wasn't cheap but. Eh.
[2023-04-23T15:44:52] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_8180@23-04-2023_15-44-52.jpg>
[2023-04-23T15:44:58] Mirono escooters: Nice case, not refurb power supply
[2023-04-23T15:45:11] Mirono escooters: Seems fine others are immediately 200‚Ç¨+
[2023-04-23T15:45:16] Mirono escooters: It doesn't seem like it
[2023-04-23T15:45:29] Mirono escooters: They even show pic inside

[2023-04-23T15:47:24] Mirono escooters: Wish I had money for something like that
[2023-04-23T15:47:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs mine lol
[2023-04-23T15:47:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: I paid 225 shipped
[2023-04-23T15:48:01] Mirono escooters: How? Xd
[2023-04-23T15:48:08] Mirono escooters: It looks great
[2023-04-23T15:48:14] Mirono escooters: Good question.
[2023-04-23T15:48:19] Mirono escooters: For scooters 3-5 lol
[2023-04-23T15:48:22] Mirono escooters: But bike will be much
[2023-04-23T15:48:30] Mirono escooters: Cells were I think max 50a charge

[2023-04-23T16:01:56] Mirono escooters: Yes, icgogogo usually
[2023-04-23T16:02:00] Mirono escooters: And the price reflects it
[2023-04-23T16:02:02] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-04-23T18:12:48] asyan4ik: Tonight
[2023-04-23T18:12:49] asyan4ik: I'm waiting for darkness
[2023-04-23T18:14:58] asyan4ik: Yeah ü§£
[2023-04-23T18:15:10] asyan4ik: Wait
[2023-04-23T19:08:10] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @roscheeee
[2023-04-23T19:10:40] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: :)

[2023-04-23T19:40:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yup
[2023-04-23T19:40:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: no, actually even easier than blade because the axle seems to be further away from the chessy which pops out the stator.
[2023-04-23T19:41:14] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: the biggest issue with opening the 60h is the cable... In this case it was easy because it was broken anyway.
[2023-04-23T20:17:12] Luis Magalhaes: The original cable pass i have bigger ones that yes is a pain üòÖ
[2023-04-23T23:35:25] Finn: Chungus
[2023-04-23T23:38:42] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Dickes Ding
[2023-04-23T23:39:15] Finn: What AWG wire do you use for your battery
[2023-04-23T23:39:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 10awg
[2023-04-23T23:39:38] Finn: You got some laying arroundüòÇ
[2023-04-23T23:39:44] Finn: For the battery?
[2023-04-23T23:39:53] Finn: Dont wanna wait until ali
[2023-04-23T23:39:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Hmm. Yes I think so.
[2023-04-23T23:44:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: 8 awg makes heat already with 150A +-
[2023-04-23T23:46:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: fuck blame the physics üòî
[2023-04-23T23:54:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think I got more than 200A per motor idk üòÇ
[2023-04-23T23:54:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: 21v battery drop
[2023-04-23T23:59:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: 7p
[2023-04-24T00:16:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: 330A and 400 absolute
[2023-04-24T00:17:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: Very much power goes lost
[2023-04-24T00:18:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: No
[2023-04-24T00:18:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: I mean in the motor
[2023-04-24T00:18:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: Efficiency is less than 50%
[2023-04-24T00:19:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: After 200A in my motor , it is very inefficient
[2023-04-24T00:19:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: I do only short ride, and I have holes on the cover
[2023-04-24T00:19:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: Without air flow it was died already
[2023-04-24T00:20:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: Lol, 133wh/km üòÇüòÇ
[2023-04-24T00:20:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: Last time 162wh/km when I tested with field weakening
[2023-04-24T00:21:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not big , but there‚Äôs difference
[2023-04-24T00:21:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: When you need performance, you do everything possible
[2023-04-24T00:21:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: Likely put tyre pressure at 1 bar ‚Ä¶
[2023-04-24T00:22:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: No but I mean I put pressure to 1 bar for more grip
[2023-04-24T00:23:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes but motor rim will crack
[2023-04-24T00:25:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: Soft don‚Äôt mean better
[2023-04-24T00:25:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: But yes, I have also rain slick and rain tyre .
[2023-04-24T01:30:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not useful
[2023-04-24T01:30:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is too soft to support motor torque
[2023-04-24T07:48:59] S1m 0n: Where üëÄüëÇ
[2023-04-24T15:56:09] asyan4ik: I am alive
[2023-04-24T15:56:17] asyan4ik: <video_file>
[2023-04-24T16:05:35] S1m 0n: Blaat without a cool fire it is pointless pollution. Too bad it did not catch fire
[2023-04-24T16:05:58] Mirono escooters: With such low voltage. Ofcourse
[2023-04-24T16:07:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: Lithium in contact with air catch fire even its at 0v
[2023-04-24T16:07:34] S1m 0n: That was a small but nice battery üòÑ
[2023-04-24T16:07:34] S1m 0n: Drone crash üî•
[2023-04-24T16:07:58] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse the element lithium
[2023-04-24T16:08:10] Mirono escooters: But the battery is much more explosive when charged
[2023-04-24T16:10:39] S1m 0n: I think Lion is generally not as responsive as lipo
[2023-04-24T16:11:22] Finn: When the voltage is low the battery voltage drops when you short the poles to that point it doesnt even give enough current it could explode or heat up
[2023-04-24T16:12:36] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-04-24T16:12:45] Mirono escooters: Lipo is way more reactive

[2023-04-25T19:07:09] Finn: Should i update my firmware?
[2023-04-25T19:13:24] Mirono escooters: Don't touch it if it ain't broken
[2023-04-25T19:26:39] Finn: Thats why i asked before i break smth
[2023-04-25T19:28:31] Finn: <photos/photo_8188@25-04-2023_19-28-31.jpg>
[2023-04-25T19:29:32] Mirono escooters: If u dont need the new features
[2023-04-25T19:29:34] Mirono escooters: I wouldn't
[2023-04-25T19:30:40] Finn: Okay thanks
[2023-04-25T19:31:15] Finn: Does this make a difference when i put the max to 9999999 or some high number?
[2023-04-25T19:31:35] Mirono escooters: You problably wont reach those rpms?
[2023-04-25T19:31:38] Mirono escooters: I mean, wich are on there
[2023-04-25T19:32:14] asyan4ik: Not for shutting;)
[2023-04-25T19:32:42] Mirono escooters: Looking good
[2023-04-25T19:32:57] Finn: What you mean
[2023-04-25T19:33:04] Finn: Should i make a spin test and see whats the result
[2023-04-25T23:30:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No, it's being modified by the profiles of the script anyway.
[2023-04-25T23:37:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: Come on, you can 19s :)
[2023-04-25T23:40:00] asyan4ik: Ok , np 75200 22s work good
[2023-04-25T23:41:12] asyan4ik: But I need a regenerative brake
[2023-04-25T23:41:31] Mirono escooters: Good mechanical all u need
[2023-04-25T23:41:36] Mirono escooters: Ps today I got my kotto brakes
[2023-04-25T23:41:40] Mirono escooters: 3mm, nice

[2023-04-25T23:42:05] Mirono escooters: Brake calipers r thick, lever is ok , could be better Have to bleed myself..
[2023-04-25T23:42:46] asyan4ik: Nope , I'm used to the two knobs. Mechanical is like an emergency brake.
[2023-04-25T23:42:55] Mirono escooters: Ooof
[2023-04-25T23:43:02] Mirono escooters: Fair enough

[2023-04-26T06:56:18] sombre_enfant: Ohhh they look nice, is it standard ?
[2023-04-26T07:34:11] Mirono escooters: Standard?
[2023-04-26T07:43:12] sombre_enfant: 44mm?
[2023-04-26T07:50:17] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-04-26T08:09:19] Thierry: How can I set two throttles, one for each motor? Flipsky are connected by CAN and throttles are connected to both vesc ADC.
[2023-04-26T08:11:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Wire them to each Vesc seperate and disconnect CAN, but why would you want two throttles?
[2023-04-26T08:14:42] Thierry: So, there is no other way? Because them I need two bluetooth module
[2023-04-26T08:15:19] Thierry: It is to not slip on curves üòÖ
[2023-04-26T08:15:38] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: You should be able to leave them connected via CAN, but maybe you are able to disable the throttle synchronisation. If there is no option, modify VESC firmware :)
[2023-04-26T08:18:54] Thierry: There is an option multiple vesc over can but I didn't reach to make it work. I will try again and see what I can do
[2023-04-26T08:18:59] Thierry: Thanks
[2023-04-26T10:31:05] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Connect via CAN. Make sure to check status 1 in app cfg from can messages rate 1. So it will send throttle response from dungeon master esc to your second slave
[2023-04-26T10:31:41] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: And make sure that can mode is set to VESC
[2023-04-26T10:32:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But connect throttle to only one adc of the master esc
[2023-04-26T10:35:29] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Also "App to use" set "adc and uart" on master esc where your throttle is in and only "uart" on second one
[2023-04-26T10:35:55] Thierry: So both throttle connected to master?
[2023-04-26T10:36:02] Thierry: Currently I have one on each

[2023-04-26T10:36:37] Thierry: Goal is to have one per motor
[2023-04-26T10:38:18] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: So yea, you need separate them then, dont use can and connect both throttles to each and set "ADC" app to use on both
[2023-04-26T10:38:51] Thierry: Then need two bluetooth module
[2023-04-26T10:38:52] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Both control mode is current, duty cycle etc
[2023-04-26T10:39:33] Thierry: And if I connect throttles to master, then it's possible to use one per motor?
[2023-04-26T10:41:28] Face de Pin Suc√©: I don't think so
[2023-04-26T10:42:53] Thierry: Thanks everybody üëç Then I will remove can connection.
[2023-04-26T10:45:43] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: If you want to control you front wheel not to slip without traction control just set phase amp close to or equal to your battery current on front wheel. And phase amps on rear are 1.5-2x more than battery current
[2023-04-26T10:46:11] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Its just an usable option
[2023-04-26T10:46:19] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Not a rule
[2023-04-26T10:48:39] Thierry: I will test but if push full throttle then front wheel release asphalt so will slip anyway
[2023-04-26T11:42:49] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Compensate for inertia by shifting mass slightly forward, leaning forward
[2023-04-26T11:58:33] Thierry: Yes I try but slip anyway
[2023-04-26T12:29:38] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: @SibClimb does traction control work good on 3shul? No lags, bugs or big power losses?
[2023-04-26T12:31:33] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I mean, probably, smth wrong with software code in it i.e
[2023-04-26T12:32:49] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Never used it yet, just remember roscheee did have issues with tronics
[2023-04-26T12:33:11] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Maybe too much of settings
[2023-04-26T12:33:32] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ok

[2023-04-26T12:37:17] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Tried to lower hfi gain to 0.1 first
[2023-04-26T12:37:24] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: It works somehow
[2023-04-26T12:37:32] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But very jerky

[2023-04-26T12:39:45] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: No, its single magnets
[2023-04-26T12:40:53] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: @PaoloWu also tells that dual magnets is no good for foc
[2023-04-26T12:44:43] Thierry: I think I remember that someone posted a picture of flipsky after few km with traction control üí•
[2023-04-26T12:49:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: works perfectly
[2023-04-26T12:50:07] Face de Pin Suc√©: I run it everyday
[2023-04-26T12:50:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: Thunder uses dual magnets , I opened one
[2023-04-26T12:54:49] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ok, i dont remember then, too old motors
[2023-04-26T12:55:06] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I thought they were single like newer big ones too
[2023-04-26T12:55:24] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Sorry
[2023-04-26T12:57:45] Thierry: Hopefully I will have more luck and should probably have a spare vesc
[2023-04-26T13:33:11] Jan: The issue is, pulling 10kW from a single focer without traction control for 2min => 35¬∞C Doing the same with traction control ON => 70¬∞C It works but we kill the controllers with the current implementation of TC. We disabled it for now
[2023-04-26T13:40:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is something about your controllers, that don‚Äôt happen with nothing else controller, even flipsky üòÖ
[2023-04-26T13:40:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs not about traction control feature
[2023-04-26T13:45:18] Face de Pin Suc√©: you talk about front one or rear one ?
[2023-04-26T13:45:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: Here, really no problem with that
[2023-04-26T13:45:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: Can't get my C350 more than 45¬∞c when it's 28¬∞c out and pulling more than 15KW on it
[2023-04-26T13:46:01] Jan: Both
[2023-04-26T13:46:03] Face de Pin Suc√©: and 350A phase
[2023-04-26T13:49:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: then there's something going on with focers
[2023-04-26T14:01:32] D J: More than 15kw with single C350?üò≥
[2023-04-26T14:06:41] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Why not
[2023-04-26T14:06:46] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Its strong
[2023-04-26T14:08:05] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You can explore HESC project on endless sphere. Its 3shul later
[2023-04-26T14:08:10] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Really good work on esc
[2023-04-26T14:37:55] Jan: What settings do you use?
[2023-04-26T14:46:33] Jan: With TC on we only had one changing its mosfet to plasma and it was the front one at 2kph. Didnt try again
[2023-04-26T14:46:57] Jan: We had it at 3000 and the power loss felt huge
[2023-04-26T14:47:08] Jan: Yes
[2023-04-26T14:47:37] Jan: Yeah resulted in spike current
[2023-04-26T14:51:45] Jan: <photos/photo_6663@12-11-2022_21-22-39.jpg>
[2023-04-26T14:52:01] Jan: Good times
[2023-04-26T14:52:11] Jan: When a setting costs 350‚Ç¨
[2023-04-26T14:58:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: Just to be know, vesc software is same in all boardsüòÇ so the problem isn‚Äôt traction control algorithm
[2023-04-26T14:59:02] Jan: Probably a power spike yeah
[2023-04-26T14:59:32] Jan: But this bothers me much
[2023-04-26T14:59:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: Repeat, even flipsky works with TC
[2023-04-26T14:59:58] Jan: The back motor feels suddenly weak.
[2023-04-26T15:00:17] Jan: Im not saying tc didnt work
[2023-04-26T15:00:46] Jan: But how the algorithm works might be flawed in its design
[2023-04-26T15:02:34] Jan: Correct me here if im wrong, i did not use the vesc tc a lot. How i think it should work but it doesnt this way: 1. Rear motor giving the input rpm 2. Only front motor has tc and corrects its rpm to rear motor rpm
[2023-04-26T15:04:28] Jan: The closed loop control doesnt get the input from the other motor to my understanding right?
[2023-04-26T15:31:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: Wow, I'm using at 3000-4000
[2023-04-26T15:31:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: Same
[2023-04-26T15:33:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: Not really

[2023-04-29T04:10:30] Rogerio Figueiredo: Don't know why
[2023-04-29T04:15:13] Jason Nelson: I had to go through maybe 6 firmwares before I found the one that worked for my controller
[2023-04-29T04:16:05] Jason Nelson: And this was every time I got a 75100, even the aluminum had issues with firmware
[2023-04-29T04:16:13] Rogerio Figueiredo: <photos/photo_8212@29-04-2023_04-16-13.jpg>

[2023-04-29T10:13:45] Face de Pin Suc√©: And this is Thunder 2 in front (110kmh x) )
[2023-04-29T10:15:07] Luis Magalhaes: Yes i know but someone will not believe the speed is same as gps üòú
[2023-04-29T10:15:44] Luis Magalhaes: Nice, was wondering what the speed of that one üòÇ
[2023-04-29T10:17:12] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, but I don't care much, since I'll ask to him to come on track and see üôà

[2023-04-29T11:25:16] AK: Its literally the same as accelerating, but in reverse
[2023-04-29T11:25:20] AK: What is there to risk?
[2023-04-29T11:26:07] AK: Unless you set up something stupid on the bms, ofc
[2023-04-29T11:26:07] Mirono escooters: Overheating
[2023-04-29T11:26:21] Mirono escooters: The 18 fet MP2 is sweating on 250a
[2023-04-29T11:26:24] AK: But there is the same amount of heat as when accelerating
[2023-04-29T11:26:24] Mirono escooters: I give it a break
[2023-04-29T11:26:42] Mirono escooters: Also prefer Mechanical feeling
[2023-04-29T11:26:44] Mirono escooters: Weird to explain xd
[2023-04-29T11:27:06] AK: Just do both, that's the most reasonable and safe thing to do
[2023-04-29T11:27:14] Mirono escooters: Later, yes
[2023-04-29T11:27:17] Mirono escooters: When I finish this bike
[2023-04-29T11:27:21] Mirono escooters: Now i just go brt

[2023-04-29T11:27:45] Mirono escooters: Its like braking on motor in a car
[2023-04-29T11:27:50] AK: Not that I do any better, too lazy to design hall mounts for my handles
[2023-04-29T11:28:12] Mirono escooters: XD

[2023-04-29T11:33:46] Mirono escooters: If it goes 25kmh with pedalling
[2023-04-29T11:37:46] Oreo huzky: Ah
[2023-04-29T11:38:23] Oreo huzky: It‚Äôs so annoying that it‚Äôs illegal to drive these kind of bikes/scooters
[2023-04-29T11:39:07] Mirono escooters: Heheehe
[2023-04-29T11:39:12] Mirono escooters: I can legalise it for 3k but
[2023-04-29T11:48:27] Oreo huzky: Legal is boring

[2023-04-29T19:31:59] Unknown: Fits perfectly on normal m365 üòÑ
[2023-04-29T20:12:25] puneDir: Hi
[2023-04-29T21:26:56] Unknown: Should i use medium or large outrunner option with blade 1200w motor?
[2023-04-29T21:35:57] sombre_enfant: Large
[2023-04-29T21:41:47] puneDir: Which one for gen1 ninebot
[2023-04-29T21:52:32] puneDir: Is vesc controllable like shfw with bt?
[2023-04-29T22:04:55] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes ofc
[2023-04-29T22:08:27] puneDir: Ok thx
[2023-04-29T22:41:37] Oreo huzky: I always used dd hub motor was that wrong?
[2023-04-29T22:42:25] Oreo huzky: For my xiaomi 1s motor and my 8000W motor
[2023-04-29T23:48:07] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I don't think it makes any difference, especially with high power motors. I chose large outrunner too, always, but I think it only means how much current it will take for measuring?
[2023-04-29T23:50:15] Mirono escooters: Doesn't matter alot
[2023-04-29T23:50:25] Mirono escooters: Isfine
[2023-04-29T23:51:26] Mirono escooters: Works always for me
[2023-04-29T23:52:58] puneDir: But the warning says you can burn your motor if you select wrong
[2023-04-29T23:53:06] Mirono escooters: Bruh
[2023-04-29T23:53:16] Mirono escooters: Its only if you would run a 50grqm drone motor on dd hub
[2023-04-29T23:53:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes but not escooter motors
[2023-04-29T23:53:24] puneDir: Lol
[2023-04-29T23:53:39] puneDir: Is gen1 good with 20s
[2023-04-29T23:53:59] Mirono escooters: Sure
[2023-04-29T23:54:05] Mirono escooters: But don't expect crazy power
[2023-04-30T00:09:34] puneDir: like how many watts
[2023-04-30T00:10:49] Mirono escooters: 1.5kw appro

[2023-04-30T01:01:36] Rogerio Figueiredo: Don't know how unfortunately
[2023-04-30T01:29:14] Oreo huzky: Ah yea that battery was janky as hell
[2023-04-30T01:29:31] Oreo huzky: Didn‚Äôt use bms or anything
[2023-04-30T02:22:53] Oreo huzky: Two xiaomi batteries in parallel
[2023-04-30T02:23:08] Oreo huzky: Bms on both died
[2023-04-30T02:23:43] Oreo huzky: Just soldered the xt60 directly to plus and minus
[2023-04-30T02:23:46] Oreo huzky: Yea
[2023-04-30T02:24:02] Oreo huzky: Just have to be a little more careful
[2023-04-30T02:24:41] Oreo huzky: I always measure voltage of each cell while charging and don‚Äôt let it charge above 39V
[2023-04-30T02:25:05] Jason Nelson: Without BMS it will never balance
[2023-04-30T02:25:15] Oreo huzky: Oh all cells are almost perfectly in balance with exception of that last cell that‚Äôs at 0V
[2023-04-30T02:25:21] Jason Nelson: Eventually one bank of cells will go critical
[2023-04-30T02:25:48] Jason Nelson: Best and most common case scenario is they will just die
[2023-04-30T02:26:00] Oreo huzky: I manual balance with charger I have 1s to 6S charger I can charge single cells with that
[2023-04-30T02:26:21] Jason Nelson: Sounds like a lot of work
[2023-04-30T02:27:12] Oreo huzky: It‚Äôs fine for me I didn‚Äôt want to build new battery for that scooter because it‚Äôs shitty I will get new one soon
[2023-04-30T02:27:48] Oreo huzky: Like really shitty it looks like it‚Äôs been though hell and back
[2023-04-30T02:28:23] Oreo huzky: It‚Äôs my daily driver it dosent need to be fancy
[2023-04-30T03:55:34] Rogerio Figueiredo: Hello guys
[2023-04-30T03:55:51] Rogerio Figueiredo: Do you connect the bms to vesc? Is it possible?

[2023-04-30T09:29:10] Mirono escooters: With a big extension
[2023-04-30T09:48:55] Oreo huzky: After 3or four charges I check if cells need balance
[2023-04-30T10:22:20] Finn: 18650?
[2023-04-30T10:24:50] puneDir: Yes
[2023-04-30T13:30:33] Oreo huzky: Yes I know those cells just died after I did a long drive with low battery
[2023-04-30T13:39:47] Oreo huzky: Yea the whole pack was already shitty I got it off an old scooter at work for free
[2023-04-30T13:41:57] Oreo huzky: I will probably remove the okay cells and make 12V battery out of it for lights and stuff
[2023-04-30T15:52:07] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Omg

[2023-04-30T18:37:50] Mirono escooters: Infinite, on paper
[2023-04-30T18:37:56] Happy Giraffe: Depends on controller and how much motor can handle

[2023-04-30T18:42:40] Mirono escooters: A house is worth more then a cheap charger Wich is like 30 bucks
[2023-04-30T18:42:54] Mirono escooters: Sell Xiaomi chargers they . Worth something

[2023-04-30T18:44:15] Mirono escooters: Its depleting rapidly
[2023-04-30T18:44:48] Mirono escooters: You need full isolated chargers, wich I don't know if Xiaomi is Its not worth guessing
[2023-04-30T18:44:52] Mirono escooters: "Don't jump to conclusions. Check the continuity between the Earth line on the line cord and the "ground" ( DC Common ) on the DC output connector with an Ohmmeter to see if they are actually connected. If they are indeed isolated you should see a minimum of 10KOhms, probably much more. If they are isolated, no need to cut."
[2023-04-30T18:45:01] Mirono escooters: "But you don't know that whether the output return path (i.e. GND) of any ATX PSU is connected to earth (e.g. via a series capacitor) or not. If return path is connected to EARTH, you cannot connect these two supplies in series. To avoid the risk of a failure, you should cut EARTH connection. But note that EARTH connection is of vital importance."

[2023-04-30T22:16:26] puneDir: but im scared of exploding escs
[2023-04-30T22:16:48] AK: Soldering big capacitors and fat lead tracks does not make them safer
[2023-04-30T22:17:03] AK: No matter what some groups/people seem to think
[2023-04-30T22:17:38] sombre_enfant: Brother in christ read the stuff or ask in one time all the question so we can answer all of them in a row
[2023-04-30T22:18:14] puneDir: Sorry
[2023-04-30T22:19:40] puneDir: @jamessoderstrom Do you know how can i close the flipsky without power button?
[2023-04-30T22:20:41] sombre_enfant: U cant theres no latch on the 12v like ubox, u neeed antispark switch, or bt bms and cut
[2023-04-30T22:21:11] puneDir: Is it safe to just disconnect the battery? And what kind of disadvantages if it stays on
[2023-04-30T22:21:39] rosheee: ur magnets longer than mine btw
[2023-04-30T22:22:06] sombre_enfant: Not if u do everyday especially without antispark setup
[2023-04-30T22:22:14] puneDir: Would not using antispark cause something
[2023-04-30T22:23:41] sombre_enfant: Whats your budget and current setup bro ? No business shi just lmk i help u been there 2 year ago i know u also young....
[2023-04-30T22:23:58] puneDir: Yeah im 16
[2023-04-30T22:24:14] puneDir: My current setup was 20s ximi esc but something went wrong and esc passed out
[2023-04-30T22:24:29] sombre_enfant: Feel free to pm for random question if i can answer i will
[2023-04-30T22:24:42] puneDir: I have pro2 with 2 10s 4ps in serial (also bought one more battery) with ninebot snsc motor
[2023-04-30T22:25:21] puneDir: My plan is go vesc to unlock a new world of customization
[2023-04-30T22:26:09] AK: Like any esc, you can just shut down the logic part by pulling the dcdc leg
[2023-04-30T22:26:36] AK: 1 wire and 1 resistor to solder
[2023-04-30T22:26:37] sombre_enfant: U do the stuff by yourself have a minimum of tool or place to go skill etc ?
[2023-04-30T22:27:33] AK: Don't use anti spark ever, it's just another failure point, and expensive one at that
[2023-04-30T22:28:41] puneDir: I do myself dw i have everything
[2023-04-30T22:29:00] puneDir: Thanks for the advice
[2023-04-30T22:29:47] sombre_enfant: If so then you can follow all the guide here, maybe the lisp part might be tuff(still dont have it) the vesc tool was ago "hard" since it was beta with right beta file need to understand the whole logic of it
[2023-04-30T22:30:14] puneDir: I guess i can get over it
[2023-04-30T22:30:21] puneDir: Shouldnt be that hard
[2023-04-30T22:42:53] AK: The stupid mosfet rows, with a pushbutton
[2023-04-30T22:44:07] puneDir: Can we diy it
[2023-04-30T22:44:41] AK: Whatever controller you are going to do, you will need a proper bms
[2023-04-30T22:45:00] AK: no, your retarded xiaomi bms which you plan on bypassing do not count as proper bms
[2023-04-30T22:45:21] AK: and after you have a proper bms, you can shutdown everything by the bms, and it will be sufficient
[2023-04-30T22:45:33] puneDir: Im not gonna bypass
[2023-04-30T22:45:46] puneDir: You can change the resistor it to close at 40a
[2023-04-30T22:46:14] puneDir: Also can you suggest a proper bms? My search engine screws it up
[2023-04-30T22:46:42] AK: I have good experience with ant bms
[2023-04-30T22:46:56] S1m 0n: Ant and LLT is very pretty
[2023-04-30T22:48:06] puneDir: Ant is too expensive
[2023-04-30T22:48:18] puneDir: I guess i will use a normal bms
[2023-04-30T22:49:35] S1m 0n: Check LLT it's a lil bit cheaper
[2023-04-30T22:50:27] AK: 50 eur
[2023-04-30T22:50:31] AK: too expensive
[2023-04-30T22:50:44] AK: but you totally will ride a 20s scooter
[2023-04-30T22:50:56] puneDir: I Live in turkey
[2023-04-30T22:51:02] puneDir: 20x more expensive
[2023-04-30T22:51:28] AK: Why? You buy on ali, at worst import tax, no?
[2023-04-30T22:51:36] puneDir: Why not use a normal 40a bms
[2023-04-30T22:51:52] puneDir: We have 50 percent tax
[2023-04-30T22:51:59] AK: Because it is not a 40a bms
[2023-04-30T22:52:23] AK: You solder a resistor and now your fets are rated x2 current?
[2023-04-30T22:52:38] puneDir: <photos/photo_8233@30-04-2023_22-52-38.jpg>
[2023-04-30T22:52:40] AK: why do you even need 20s if 40a is all you can push
[2023-04-30T22:52:44] puneDir: Plus this
[2023-04-30T22:52:54] puneDir: No i will buy 40a aliexpress bms
[2023-04-30T22:52:55] AK: yeah that's a major pain in the ass
[2023-04-30T22:53:26] AK: Proceed in small steps, 20s is dangerous on its own, try to get it all working with what you have right now, if you are limited on budget
[2023-04-30T22:53:51] puneDir: Yes
[2023-04-30T22:53:57] puneDir: Might run on 20a for some time
[2023-04-30T22:54:03] puneDir: Btw xiaomi esc is 30a normally
[2023-04-30T22:54:10] puneDir: But no communication limits it to 20a
[2023-04-30T22:55:31] puneDir: Can you send link?
[2023-04-30T22:55:36] Mirono escooters: Very cheap and good
[2023-04-30T22:55:52] AK: Shunt it to 30, whatever
[2023-04-30T22:55:57] AK: Propably won't explode
[2023-04-30T22:56:10] puneDir: My search engine shows only dally bms
[2023-04-30T22:56:16] puneDir: Yeah i guess
[2023-04-30T22:59:52] Jan: ?
[2023-04-30T22:59:56] puneDir: cant ship to here :(
[2023-04-30T23:00:45] puneDir: Why dont use cheap 40a no smart bms?
[2023-04-30T23:02:12] sombre_enfant: Put in your basket Fs75100 Xt90s Llt/jbd 100A 6/22s And all the stuff needed for craft in between heatshrink kapton thermal paste and keep thinking if you have all the money time needed

[2023-04-30T23:04:39] Mirono escooters: App is buggy, control is limited, BMS is Bulky, expensive,not turn off when cells are below min v.
[2023-04-30T23:04:45] puneDir: Flipsky is shipping and i have other ones in hand
[2023-04-30T23:04:54] Mirono escooters: I've received doas, I got bmses for free and I wasn't happy It killed a 200‚Ç¨ lipo pack!!
[2023-04-30T23:05:03] puneDir: Is there a 3 connector i can use for motor?

[2023-05-01T12:22:58] Happy Giraffe: @PaoloWu How did vesc field weakening current behave? Does it add it on top of battery current?
[2023-05-01T12:23:21] Happy Giraffe: Like 40A normal battery current and then 20A weakening = 60A
[2023-05-01T12:28:11] Happy Giraffe: This seems to be true
[2023-05-01T12:28:11] Happy Giraffe: In logs battery amps = bat+ fw
[2023-05-01T12:34:29] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, so I will lower batt from 42 to 30 and then test with 10A fweakening
[2023-05-01T12:45:03] Mirono escooters: Got Bluetooth BMS?

[2023-05-01T17:53:04] Mirono escooters: Ok time for a bit more amps try to reach the barrier
[2023-05-01T17:55:46] Mirono escooters: 94kmh gps
[2023-05-01T17:55:49] Mirono escooters: Close enough

[2023-05-01T17:57:11] Mirono escooters: Ignore speedometer
[2023-05-01T17:58:00] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Looks like nothing happens to temperature
[2023-05-01T17:58:23] Mirono escooters: Yes, temp probe measures the heatsink
[2023-05-01T17:58:31] Mirono escooters: I can't get it closer to mos atm
[2023-05-01T17:58:51] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yea, need as close as possible
[2023-05-01T17:59:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Interesting btw, your goodüëç
[2023-05-01T17:59:11] Mirono escooters: Its a test unit, so it's ok, it has 2mm pad, wich is ü§∑
[2023-05-01T17:59:25] Mirono escooters: Its build to abuse and quickly try stuff
[2023-05-01T17:59:35] puneDir: Can we convert lifepo4 bms to work with lion
[2023-05-01T18:01:06] puneDir: Found bunch of them for cheap
[2023-05-01T18:02:15] Mirono escooters: Nop
[2023-05-01T18:02:21] Mirono escooters: Found out I can lock rear wheel, fun
[2023-05-01T18:02:28] Mirono escooters: Wich is impressive considering it's size
[2023-05-01T18:04:21] Mirono escooters: <video_file>
[2023-05-01T18:04:50] Mirono escooters: Why it so slowly ramps up amps?
[2023-05-01T18:04:52] Mirono escooters: Full throttle
[2023-05-01T18:05:16] Mirono escooters: 8.8kw is nice
[2023-05-01T18:07:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: In flipsky it touch fet directly
[2023-05-01T18:22:13] Mirono escooters: I know
[2023-05-01T18:22:22] Mirono escooters: My next MP2 also
[2023-05-01T18:31:07] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I will put my temp sensor between the MOSFETs on mine and put silicone on top. Should do the job.
[2023-05-01T18:31:16] Mirono escooters: Good idea
[2023-05-01T18:31:23] Mirono escooters: I'm problably doing something alike
[2023-05-01T18:31:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: TO220 have those small [] between them, where you can neatly place it
[2023-05-01T18:31:45] Mirono escooters: Yee
[2023-05-01T18:51:07] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2023-05-01T19:03:16] Mirono escooters: The kotto brakes are really nice, 2 piston but they so big, it stops my wheel immediately
[2023-05-01T19:16:48] gil guy: Why not .. find schematic ,and/or find IC used . And find datasheet..
[2023-05-01T19:32:57] Happy Giraffe: Haha, what batt is that?
[2023-05-01T19:33:16] Mirono escooters: 20s
[2023-05-01T19:33:20] Happy Giraffe: <animation>
[2023-05-01T19:33:23] Mirono escooters: 100a
[2023-05-01T19:34:23] Mirono escooters: When you race me
[2023-05-01T19:36:23] Happy Giraffe: We can do efficiency race
[2023-05-01T19:36:43] Happy Giraffe: I did today like 35km and only drained 33% battüåö
[2023-05-01T19:55:24] Mirono escooters: Ive got a overcompensating 3kwh battery
[2023-05-01T19:55:33] Mirono escooters: At the most boring speed and power
[2023-05-01T19:55:49] Mirono escooters: I'm here for a good time not a long time
[2023-05-01T20:10:54] Happy Giraffe: Haha, it's impressive efficiency for 3 year old battery that has been driven 6000km always 0-100% charge to empty charge
[2023-05-01T20:11:10] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-05-01T20:11:12] Mirono escooters: Mine is refurn cells atm
[2023-05-01T20:11:16] Mirono escooters: While I wait for pouch
[2023-05-01T20:16:35] Happy Giraffe: I wish some vesc features had better description than now theres available. Im example observers etc features which motor type likes which one
[2023-05-01T20:16:46] Mirono escooters: Hey can you show in vesc app the meters travelled? I'm trying to figure out braking distance
[2023-05-01T20:19:03] Happy Giraffe: What?üò≥
[2023-05-01T20:20:20] Mirono escooters: Eh, I'll just use math
[2023-05-01T20:20:22] Mirono escooters: And meth
[2023-05-01T20:21:33] Happy Giraffe: Didn't understand your question
[2023-05-01T20:23:41] Mirono escooters: me neither
[2023-05-01T20:24:10] Mirono escooters: no ok, on rt tab, i wonderd if we could change out what is showed, so i can see meters travelled, to calculate braking distanc
[2023-05-01T20:24:21] Mirono escooters: but i can do it mathematically easier
[2023-05-01T21:19:28] Mirono escooters: Too much work
[2023-05-01T21:19:31] Mirono escooters: Physics work
[2023-05-01T21:20:10] Mirono escooters: Math will work and more accurate
[2023-05-01T21:20:23] Mirono escooters: Well, idk, actually. Braking is not linear, but we can assume it is
[2023-05-01T21:20:41] Mirono escooters: I don't think I can brake on command at 90kmh when I pass a tree
[2023-05-01T21:21:18] AK: Just press f, and you will jump from the bike
[2023-05-01T21:22:22] puneDir: Is there a screen i could fit into xiaomi board
[2023-05-01T21:22:27] puneDir: I mean dashboard
[2023-05-01T21:22:46] puneDir: <photos/photo_8243@01-05-2023_21-22-46.jpg>
[2023-05-01T21:22:55] Mirono escooters: XD no , none fit inside it lol
[2023-05-01T21:22:57] Mirono escooters: Use original
[2023-05-01T21:22:58] puneDir: I want a screen like this But fits into xiaomi dash
[2023-05-01T21:23:01] Mirono escooters: Or flipsky display
[2023-05-01T21:23:16] puneDir: Maybe i can 3d print and redesign stuff
[2023-05-01T21:23:21] Mirono escooters: Have fun
[2023-05-01T21:23:22] Mirono escooters: :)
[2023-05-01T21:23:25] puneDir: But to much work
[2023-05-01T21:23:33] Mirono escooters: I'm making a Xiaomi display, but I'm not planning on vescing it's compatibility
[2023-05-01T21:23:46] AK: You should concentrate on one thing at a time
[2023-05-01T21:23:48] puneDir: I want something more uniqie
[2023-05-01T21:24:00] puneDir: It was just a thought
[2023-05-01T21:24:12] AK: your scooter, especially your first big modded scoot is going to be shit in almost everything, when you build it
[2023-05-01T21:24:15] AK: That's alright
[2023-05-01T21:24:21] AK: Every new project is
[2023-05-01T21:24:22] Mirono escooters: Yep, universal rule
[2023-05-01T21:24:32] AK: Start with a minimum viable product
[2023-05-01T21:24:35] AK: and work from there
[2023-05-01T21:24:45] Mirono escooters: First bike, shit Bomber, coool
[2023-05-01T21:25:00] puneDir: Btw
[2023-05-01T21:25:05] puneDir: <photos/photo_8244@01-05-2023_21-25-05.jpg>
[2023-05-01T21:25:12] puneDir: I got another snsc lol
[2023-05-01T21:25:18] Mirono escooters: Soo
[2023-05-01T21:25:23] puneDir: Maybe i can build dual snsc pro2 w vesc
[2023-05-01T21:25:30] Mirono escooters: Ok
[2023-05-01T21:25:37] puneDir: <photos/photo_8245@01-05-2023_21-25-37.jpg>
[2023-05-01T21:25:53] Mirono escooters: Get better Front suspension to start
[2023-05-01T21:25:54] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2023-05-01T21:25:57] Mirono escooters: And a good spring rear
[2023-05-01T21:26:27] puneDir: ƒ± cutted this and can fit everything
[2023-05-01T21:26:31] puneDir: Lol
[2023-05-01T21:26:37] Mirono escooters: üò∂
[2023-05-01T21:27:14] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2023-05-01T21:27:19] Mirono escooters: For scooters that ks
[2023-05-01T21:28:46] puneDir: suicide scooter
[2023-05-01T21:30:14] Mirono escooters: Never
[2023-05-01T21:30:19] Mirono escooters: You have immediately wheelslip
[2023-05-01T21:30:34] Mirono escooters: I've seen middrive and rear together But thats so weird
[2023-05-01T22:44:51] Happy Giraffe: Ahh you want to measure braking distance, put a stick on a road and then brake on that lineüåö
[2023-05-01T22:45:13] Mirono escooters: I'm not doing that precisely
[2023-05-01T22:49:20] Happy Giraffe: Then vesc log and start braking and see distance it took
[2023-05-02T10:21:12] Unknown: Hey Ron
[2023-05-02T10:26:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Welcome
[2023-05-02T10:27:16] Mirono escooters: Morning
[2023-05-02T11:05:49] puneDir: I wanna ask something
[2023-05-02T11:06:08] puneDir: If i make dual i cant fit brakes Is vesc brake gonna be ok?
[2023-05-02T11:09:38] Finn: uh sure. I mean in an case where youre vesc decides to die you cannot break so i would do one mechanical break as abackup
[2023-05-02T11:09:59] Finn: Electronic breaks are good when you configure them right
[2023-05-02T11:11:26] puneDir: This is scary
[2023-05-02T11:11:39] puneDir: Is there a wizard for it
[2023-05-02T11:12:03] puneDir: I guess i should ask questions after getting my vesc on my hands and trying different settings
[2023-05-02T11:12:24] Finn: uh i mean it should be configured right after you do the intialize of the motor. You can turn up the amps of the breaking strenth too to increase breaking force
[2023-05-02T11:12:40] Finn: yep
[2023-05-02T11:13:47] Alin Ciobanu: Good morning, does anyone have the right firmware for the flipsky 75100 (rectangular case)?
[2023-05-02T11:14:17] Alin Ciobanu: <photos/photo_8246@02-05-2023_11-14-17.jpg>
[2023-05-02T11:14:54] puneDir: Can you send more pics of it
[2023-05-02T11:15:15] puneDir: My battery is max 40a i guess
[2023-05-02T11:15:27] puneDir: Does it work by sending voltage back to battery
[2023-05-02T11:18:50] Alin Ciobanu: <photos/photo_8247@02-05-2023_11-18-50.jpg>

[2023-05-02T11:19:14] Alin Ciobanu: Factory thermal paste flipsky does not exist
[2023-05-02T11:19:19] AK: Isn't it mergrd into the configurator already?
[2023-05-02T11:21:11] Alin Ciobanu: I disassembled 6/7 all with the same problems, no thermal paste and capacitors that move.
[2023-05-02T11:22:23] Unknown: Is the 75100alu is cooler?
[2023-05-02T11:22:32] Alin Ciobanu: The last time it came to me, which recognized HW:75300
[2023-05-02T11:23:10] Alin Ciobanu: It‚Äôs the classic 75100
[2023-05-02T11:23:52] Unknown: Ah sorry
[2023-05-02T12:03:37] Mirono escooters: Why can't u fit brakes?..
[2023-05-02T12:07:16] Oreo huzky: If you have any enough brake current it would work like -50 phase amps but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend
[2023-05-02T12:07:51] Mirono escooters: Way more..
[2023-05-02T12:08:16] Mirono escooters: And if you trust ebrake only lol, atleast mount 1 backup mechanical
[2023-05-02T12:08:28] Mirono escooters: Dont go AWD and crazy if u can't figure out bRakes.its #1
[2023-05-02T12:09:22] Oreo huzky: If you have dual -50 is actually okay it so in total you would have -100
[2023-05-02T12:23:28] AK: I am really looking forward to his build
[2023-05-02T12:23:47] AK: I mean xiaomi was already spectacular
[2023-05-02T12:24:14] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-05-02T12:24:14] AK: Also I rode with my vsett displaying speed to work today, seemingly no issues, really happy
[2023-05-02T12:24:27] AK: Gon do mode switching today
[2023-05-02T12:24:32] Mirono escooters: Im concerned and curious at the same time
[2023-05-02T12:24:42] Mirono escooters: @S1m0n_420
[2023-05-02T12:24:55] Oreo huzky: Use laotie ti30 rear motor holder and bolt it to frame for bigger motor and brake
[2023-05-02T12:25:00] AK: It's like the pimple popping videos, really disgusting, but really hard not to look at
[2023-05-02T12:32:09] Ion: Stock Display, right? Will this be available as like a lisp script?
[2023-05-02T12:33:18] puneDir: Drum brake
[2023-05-02T12:33:38] Mirono escooters: Just mount a disk brake?..
[2023-05-02T12:34:16] AK: Yeah, it's a lisp script. Just need to connect rx tx, and that's it.
[2023-05-02T12:38:29] AK: Yeah, it was, but I thought it over and decided against it. No reason for it.
[2023-05-02T12:39:19] AK: There are well documented projects for vesc and light control, maybe I'll see to adapt rESCue later, but tbh that is all secondary
[2023-05-02T12:39:29] AK: No reason to have the display depend on it
[2023-05-02T12:39:43] AK: And no reason to force it on the user.
[2023-05-02T12:42:05] S1m 0n: Great work
[2023-05-02T12:42:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I will only use ebrake as well üëÄ
[2023-05-02T12:43:02] S1m 0n: U have PayPal? Will spend u a lil bit
[2023-05-02T12:45:30] AK: Vsett throttle is adc, there is a separate 4v line
[2023-05-02T12:45:40] AK: I'll do a schematic, how to connect
[2023-05-02T12:45:52] AK: You propably have seen my repo, most of it is done
[2023-05-02T12:46:29] AK: Sure, appreciate it, when I publish the script. I'd also appreciate testing/feedback on a "real" vsett
[2023-05-02T12:47:08] S1m 0n: Can not serve with ü§£
[2023-05-02T12:47:12] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: you've hardly been away from home for a week and you don't understand the world anymore there is a Vsett Lisp protocol?üëÄüëÄüëÄ
[2023-05-02T12:47:38] S1m 0n: Sure..every China Scooter have it, where the throttle is connected to display
[2023-05-02T12:47:41] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: git push
[2023-05-02T12:47:58] AK: I meant the other one with schematics
[2023-05-02T12:48:04] AK: Lisp is not up yet
[2023-05-02T12:48:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: ah
[2023-05-02T12:48:25] AK: Yes, but not on all. The 10 throttle and display do
[2023-05-02T12:48:34] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: Thanksüî•
[2023-05-02T12:48:51] AK: I think the 8 does not have separate wire for throttle
[2023-05-02T12:48:57] S1m 0n: Thank to @aka13
[2023-05-02T12:49:11] S1m 0n: It have
[2023-05-02T12:49:24] S1m 0n: I had a controller from 8
[2023-05-02T12:49:59] AK: Not sure which one, don't remember, but there is a 5 throttle and esc which send throttle via uart
[2023-05-02T12:50:04] AK: 100%
[2023-05-02T12:50:27] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: yes definitely thank you @aka13 you finally make the impossible possible üôáüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2023-05-02T12:50:36] AK: Yeah, less headaches, "native"
[2023-05-02T12:51:13] S1m 0n: Display all the same.. Vbat, DS (Power Scooter power on), RX, TX, GND and Throttle
[2023-05-02T12:51:34] S1m 0n: If they have only 5 Pins, most of the time DS is missing
[2023-05-02T12:53:07] S1m 0n: Yes
[2023-05-02T12:53:46] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It is.
[2023-05-02T12:53:52] S1m 0n: Why not?
[2023-05-02T12:53:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But uhm, vedderb has not implemented it correctly
[2023-05-02T12:54:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and it's missing a security feature
[2023-05-02T12:54:08] S1m 0n: GND is connected together
[2023-05-02T12:54:13] AK: You should use a divider, not only because of the 4v on full throttle
[2023-05-02T12:54:15] S1m 0n: Throttle signal goes to vesc
[2023-05-02T12:54:28] AK: Adc should not get more than 3.3, will die sooner or later
[2023-05-02T12:54:53] S1m 0n: Oh okay
[2023-05-02T12:55:54] AK: But for throttle short cirxuit as well. Set it up so that on full throttle you only reach 3.1 for example. In that case, should your throttle get a 5v short, you can disable accel if vin >3.1
[2023-05-02T12:56:00] AK: And not accelerate into a wall
[2023-05-02T12:56:18] AK: @jamessoderstrom
[2023-05-02T12:57:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Nothing is more scary than a throttle that you cannot control.
[2023-05-02T12:58:14] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But this only applies to throttle inputs from Lisp
[2023-05-02T12:58:28] Finn: And if the break doesnt work tooüòÑ
[2023-05-02T12:58:30] AK: It's built in nowadays, just have to remember to set it up
[2023-05-02T14:46:44] rosheee: <photos/photo_8252@02-05-2023_14-46-44.jpg>

[2023-05-02T15:34:02] Face de Pin Suc√©: Does it happen to you near max speed when you are full throttle ?
[2023-05-02T15:36:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: well, I have the answer on the pic x)
[2023-05-02T15:37:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: @roscheeee what firmware version do you have ? What were your settings ? What was battery voltage ?
[2023-05-02T15:37:50] Face de Pin Suc√©: I'm currently facing the same problem, will work this out by the end of the week, but, for now, I've found the only solution was to be like 95% throttle instead of 100% throttle x)
[2023-05-02T15:38:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: And it happens on 3 different scooters here
[2023-05-02T15:38:21] Face de Pin Suc√©: This happened many times around 135Kmh to me, it's pretty scary x)
[2023-05-02T15:38:46] Mirono escooters: You guys think 98-99 duty is ok? MP2?
[2023-05-02T15:39:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Damn
[2023-05-02T15:39:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Why not stay 95
[2023-05-02T15:39:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: ?
[2023-05-02T15:39:48] Mirono escooters: Boring?
[2023-05-02T15:39:51] Mirono escooters: More speed, powr
[2023-05-02T15:40:03] Face de Pin Suc√©: For now, I only use C350, don't have proper other VESC capable to push my scooter full speed x)
[2023-05-02T15:40:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: But it didn't happen before, I don't know why now
[2023-05-02T15:45:23] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, which is weird because never happened before
[2023-05-02T15:45:41] Face de Pin Suc√©: And always happens to the master one
[2023-05-02T15:45:57] Face de Pin Suc√©: I'm trying to think it might be because of battery sag, I don't know
[2023-05-02T15:46:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: front always master
[2023-05-02T15:48:17] Mirono escooters: MP2? :(
[2023-05-02T15:49:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: Vesc express
[2023-05-02T15:49:51] Mirono escooters: A long usb Cable?
[2023-05-02T15:50:33] Face de Pin Suc√©: I only have one assembled, I need two to reproduce the same testing conditions
[2023-05-02T15:50:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: I haven't worked it out yet, will work on this this week
[2023-05-02T15:52:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: That's the main problem x)
[2023-05-02T15:52:38] Mirono escooters: Didn't u buy 2 PCBs?
[2023-05-02T15:52:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: yes maybe but need a very powerful wifi
[2023-05-02T15:53:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: yes I did, but no time to assemble, have to work x)
[2023-05-02T15:53:11] Mirono escooters: :/
[2023-05-02T15:53:13] Mirono escooters: Sad
[2023-05-02T15:53:47] Face de Pin Suc√©: yes true
[2023-05-02T15:53:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: will try this week
[2023-05-02T15:54:21] Face de Pin Suc√©: But seeing the exact same fault on Tronic makes it even weirder
[2023-05-02T15:56:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs problem about shunt
[2023-05-02T15:57:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_8254@02-05-2023_15-57-43.jpg>
[2023-05-02T16:00:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: We thought it was just our assembly fault, because we hand soldered shunts
[2023-05-02T16:05:32] Face de Pin Suc√©: Damn, it's not reassuring at all to see this error everywhere
[2023-05-02T16:06:06] Mirono escooters: Newest fw only?
[2023-05-02T16:06:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: Well, it's a possibility, but somewhere I've read that it should be 30% current differences, and also, should happen at start, not near max speed
[2023-05-02T16:06:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: I use only 5.3, only stable version
[2023-05-02T16:06:47] rosheee: yup but only once
[2023-05-02T16:07:02] Face de Pin Suc√©: both x)
[2023-05-02T16:07:15] Mirono escooters: Me too xd
[2023-05-02T16:07:39] rosheee: happened only once
[2023-05-02T16:08:04] rosheee: at max throttle the setup i did for Jan is super pervert omg
[2023-05-02T16:08:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you want it can be bypassed, but I don‚Äôt recommendüòÇ
[2023-05-02T16:08:55] rosheee: i redo the setup in 1h
[2023-05-02T16:09:43] rosheee: also funny it happened downhill üòÜ
[2023-05-02T16:10:16] Face de Pin Suc√©: It never happened before so I don't know
[2023-05-02T16:10:24] Face de Pin Suc√©: same
[2023-05-02T16:10:26] S1m 0n: There are no resistors in between? MCU pins are directly connected to the connector?
[2023-05-02T16:10:28] rosheee: <photos/photo_8255@02-05-2023_16-10-28.jpg>
[2023-05-02T16:11:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: Luckily flipsky work no probüòÇ
[2023-05-02T16:11:34] Mirono escooters: üò∂
[2023-05-02T16:11:50] puneDir: Flipsky is the cheapest
[2023-05-02T16:11:55] rosheee: <photos/photo_8256@02-05-2023_16-11-55.jpg>
[2023-05-02T16:11:57] puneDir: Must be the worst
[2023-05-02T16:12:09] Mirono escooters: Bruh
[2023-05-02T16:12:29] Mirono escooters: MP2 is cheaper, must be worsener Oh wait.
[2023-05-02T16:12:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: No, 3.6v is safe limit, 4v is absolute maximum. Then after 4v it will fail
[2023-05-02T16:12:49] Face de Pin Suc√©: @roscheeee what firmware do you have ?
[2023-05-02T16:12:54] rosheee: newest
[2023-05-02T16:12:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: okay so 6.2
[2023-05-02T16:13:04] rosheee: but never happened until today
[2023-05-02T16:13:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: Gal does shunt mod
[2023-05-02T16:14:14] rosheee: 2 days ago i did fuckeria runs incl. police outrun üòÜdidn't happened
[2023-05-02T16:14:26] rosheee: no
[2023-05-02T16:14:48] rosheee: they passed me from other side
[2023-05-02T16:14:53] rosheee: but i had like 100-110kmh ^^'
[2023-05-02T16:15:04] rosheee: jan saw it live on cam üòÜ
[2023-05-02T16:15:25] rosheee: max possible
[2023-05-02T16:15:52] rosheee: idk how fast jan was connected to vesc + live cam stream but didn't happened
[2023-05-02T16:16:04] rosheee: i need the settings i did for jan ^^'' they fuck hardcore
[2023-05-02T16:16:23] rosheee: he in france
[2023-05-02T16:16:25] rosheee: scooter in switzerland
[2023-05-02T16:17:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: It happens only when full throttle near max speed
[2023-05-02T16:17:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: to not trigger it I push like 90% of throttle x)
[2023-05-02T16:18:02] rosheee: didn't happened before redone the setup there 1km full throttle
[2023-05-02T16:18:28] rosheee: maybe go back to 5.3 xD?
[2023-05-02T16:18:38] Face de Pin Suc√©: I'm running 5.3 x)
[2023-05-02T16:18:41] rosheee: and only rear motor had that problem
[2023-05-02T16:18:55] rosheee: maybe cuz ferrofluid not only on magnets ^^'
[2023-05-02T16:19:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: me it's front
[2023-05-02T16:20:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: no ferrofluid here
[2023-05-02T16:23:36] rosheee: yes rear only
[2023-05-02T16:24:26] rosheee: i had like 2-3h on jan's setup ^^' runs super sexy
[2023-05-02T16:24:42] rosheee: i reflash and redo setup now üòÜ
[2023-05-02T16:24:53] rosheee: maybe open it and check escs ^^'
[2023-05-02T16:27:14] rosheee: jan has like 3sec 50-100kmh
[2023-05-02T16:27:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: yes, almost same, it changes a little because of wires, but not much
[2023-05-02T16:28:20] rosheee: <photos/photo_8257@02-05-2023_16-28-20.jpg>
[2023-05-02T16:28:21] Face de Pin Suc√©: 350/410A haha And 180A battery
[2023-05-02T16:29:38] rosheee: i do 180 motor front 240abs 105battery i do 190 motor rear 250abs 105battery but with FW it goes over 300A battery ^^'
[2023-05-02T16:30:40] Face de Pin Suc√©: I don't use field, don't need to x)
[2023-05-02T16:31:13] rosheee: XD
[2023-05-02T16:31:24] rosheee: maybe i go higher with battery amps and FW off
[2023-05-02T16:31:41] rosheee: can u send vesc settings xml pls ^^ ?
[2023-05-02T16:31:44] rosheee: OR SECRET XD?
[2023-05-02T16:37:50] puneDir: Does vesc counts kilometers
[2023-05-02T16:37:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: too lazy to connect and dump and send now x)
[2023-05-02T16:41:45] S1m 0n: So if you have a throttle that needs 5V and it put and never give out more than 3.6V, do you connect it to 5V or still 3V?
[2023-05-02T16:42:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: Always to 3.3v
[2023-05-02T16:43:58] S1m 0n: I have a friend who says he has then only about 50-60% of the power. So he needs a new gas lever and can throw away?
[2023-05-02T16:54:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: No, vesc can set Max and min voltage , just do the setup input again
[2023-05-02T16:56:40] S1m 0n: Thanks
[2023-05-02T17:05:56] Happy Giraffe: Can also buy the adc adapter from spintend
[2023-05-02T19:55:57] Mirono escooters: IF we use a speed limit in vrsc
[2023-05-02T19:56:09] Mirono escooters: Will it cut out when u go above x rpm? Or will it gradually lower power?
[2023-05-02T20:29:25] AK: You propably have it set already, can't remember which version this came in
[2023-05-02T20:30:54] Mirono escooters: Safe start, is it on by default?
[2023-05-02T20:31:10] Mirono escooters: My worst fear happened once, a throttle stuck in Max, bike flew away.
[2023-05-02T20:31:15] Mirono escooters: It was a cheapo Esc tho
[2023-05-02T20:31:17] Mirono escooters: Ok perfect..
[2023-05-02T20:32:13] AK: The problem is that this can only protect you on a "full failure", where there the hall is shorted or something like that
[2023-05-02T20:32:23] AK: It won't save you from you jamming the throttle
[2023-05-02T20:33:14] Mirono escooters: With mine, the cable and sensor??? Flew out of throttle because cable got hooked Sensor gave full power and I didn't see it dangling
[2023-05-02T20:33:21] Mirono escooters: AS soon as I turned breaker on Brt.
[2023-05-02T20:33:29] Mirono escooters: And It flew from beneath my legs
[2023-05-02T20:37:49] Mirono escooters: Yeah.
[2023-05-02T20:37:59] Mirono escooters: Imagine that happens when. A car passed by or people. It would be immense.
[2023-05-02T20:38:20] AK: This looks banal, but it's vesc. Refresh rate is like stock, but could be higher propably
[2023-05-02T20:38:21] AK: https://github.com/aka13-404/VSETT-LISP/blob/master/vsett_display_dual_vesc.lisp I have just pushed the mvp, for anyone who is interested. Right now it only displays speed. You have to connect rx and tx accordingly. I'd be interested how well it runs on the qs mini screen, should be the same protocol. I am in no capacity today to do the modes, prop tomorrow.
[2023-05-02T20:38:34] Happy Giraffe: Both are available
[2023-05-02T20:38:57] Mirono escooters: I'm also wondering, does every hall sensor in throttle give full power when no magnet is there?.. because, that sounds like a huge safety concern Ok, usually wires rip, but if sensor and all flies out, like it did?
[2023-05-02T20:39:06] Mirono escooters: Perfect.
[2023-05-02T20:39:38] Mirono escooters: You are a genius

[2023-05-02T21:15:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: No need, it's rear, only electric brake for rear
[2023-05-02T21:15:39] Face de Pin Suc√©: Front is drum brake
[2023-05-02T21:15:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: Speedway leger as usual haha, just updated the motor

[2023-05-02T21:20:32] Mirono escooters: Hehehehe
[2023-05-02T21:21:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: It was 42Kmh without field weakening and 50Kmh with a little bit of field before, running 10S and old motor, but now lower KV and higher voltage, will see the top speed, but I don't want it to go more than 60Km/h
[2023-05-02T21:21:38] Face de Pin Suc√©: I've done the crazy things on small escooter, etwow 72V with 75Kmh topspeed was enough for me hahaha

[2023-05-02T21:22:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: xD
[2023-05-02T21:22:37] Face de Pin Suc√©: I was pushing 200A phase and 75A battery, was a rocket up to 42Kmh but miss like 15Kmh
[2023-05-02T21:23:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: Don't know yet, that was on the same KV as the one I sold to you
[2023-05-02T21:23:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: this one, not tested yet, have some work to do on it

[2023-05-02T21:24:37] Mirono escooters: You can't keep it a stock commuter
[2023-05-02T21:25:08] puneDir: Idk why dualtrons use shit 1khz controller instead of vesc
[2023-05-02T21:25:45] Mirono escooters: They have 0 point using vesc
[2023-05-02T21:25:57] Mirono escooters: Since its expensive and 99% of their customers don't want to tune anything
[2023-05-02T21:26:02] Mirono escooters: Their generic Escs are fine for em
[2023-05-02T21:27:13] Mirono escooters: Lool

[2023-05-02T21:29:49] puneDir: also thinking about how can i fit second motor to back
[2023-05-02T21:29:59] puneDir: It has drum brake and long shaft
[2023-05-02T21:31:12] Mirono escooters: Drum needs also something to stop it from rotating with it, except if its stuck to axle My snsc motor here doesn't
[2023-05-02T21:31:16] Mirono escooters: Wide suspension
[2023-05-02T21:38:04] puneDir: Thinking about how to widen it
[2023-05-02T23:04:57] Jason Nelson: <photos/photo_8262@02-05-2023_23-04-57.jpg>
[2023-05-02T23:05:27] Jason Nelson: I had another fabricated bracket for snsc because it mounts differently with thread holes
[2023-05-02T23:06:42] Jason Nelson: <photos/photo_8263@02-05-2023_23-06-42.jpg>
[2023-05-02T23:07:05] Jason Nelson: You need a spacer between the plate and the drum so it doesn't pull it at an angle
[2023-05-02T23:07:17] Jason Nelson: Also ideally you will use both mounting holes and not just one
[2023-05-02T23:36:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Read pls

[2023-05-03T09:46:52] Unknown: The throttle is also vestt?
[2023-05-03T09:47:26] S1m 0n: Apparently the Simmerrings from Kaabo are not particularly good, because water often collects in the cavity between the Simmerring and the ball bearing
[2023-05-03T09:47:36] Unknown: And also did he program the display or what?
[2023-05-03T09:47:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If there is non outside touching,you must open it, Before problems come

[2023-05-03T09:54:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I need to take a look closer but probably all you do is push axle over bearing,not cables out from it ,so i not sure how it is
[2023-05-03T09:54:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So far i opened all

[2023-05-03T15:22:16] Mirono escooters: Ok, bike maybe cheating
[2023-05-03T15:22:21] rosheee: but but but
[2023-05-03T15:22:27] Jan: So much cnc work with copper etc and the temp move up faster than speed
[2023-05-03T15:22:28] rosheee: then how communication?
[2023-05-03T15:22:54] Jan: I would consider going for another concept
[2023-05-03T15:23:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: I told he already that ubox dual isn‚Äôt good for this project
[2023-05-03T15:23:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: He has very powerful battery , very good frame and it‚Äôs limited by vesc
[2023-05-03T15:23:46] Jan: He russian?

[2023-05-03T15:23:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2023-05-03T15:23:57] Jan: Would probably be hard to get controllers
[2023-05-03T15:24:11] rosheee: switzerland is here to provide
[2023-05-03T15:24:13] Mirono escooters: Sad

[2023-05-03T15:29:50] rosheee: why same speed like vsett motors?
[2023-05-03T15:29:54] rosheee: <animation>
[2023-05-03T15:33:20] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes but slow
[2023-05-03T15:34:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: Wider magnet reduces kv considering same winding configuration
[2023-05-03T15:34:39] Face de Pin Suc√©: No it can't be, 331A on one side of ubox dual isn't possible
[2023-05-03T15:35:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: My ubox did fireworks at 250A
[2023-05-03T15:36:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: You can‚Äôt believe how big was the fire

[2023-05-03T17:16:38] Mirono escooters: Not like it's safe but
[2023-05-03T17:16:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: True
[2023-05-03T17:17:33] puneDir: Why its not
[2023-05-03T17:18:23] Mirono escooters: Is it so much bad to just hold throttle? Control yourself?
[2023-05-03T17:18:46] Mirono escooters: You rely on software to stop cruise control, if bug or your brake? Or whatever doesn't deactivate it
[2023-05-03T17:19:01] Mirono escooters: I never ever understood the obsession w cruise control
[2023-05-03T17:19:06] Mirono escooters: Its banned in eu for reasons

[2023-05-03T18:05:08] rosheee: This only 1 motor

[2023-05-03T18:29:32] Thierry: I have standard kv and can only 80km/h... these motors can definitely not reach high speed.
[2023-05-03T18:30:47] Jan: Vsett 10+ motor 117kph gps topspeed
[2023-05-03T18:41:54] Thierry: 60H 80km/h with 20s and 106km/h with 130A fw
[2023-05-03T19:05:51] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: GT2 24kv

[2023-05-03T19:14:21] Jan: runs 123kph at 30A fw
[2023-05-03T19:23:58] Thierry: High kv one?
[2023-05-03T19:25:11] Thierry: I'm bit disappointed of standard one, I wanted 100-120 and can only 80
[2023-05-03T19:31:15] Jason Nelson: I just installed a hall sensor into my sensors motor and when I ran detection it still shows sensors. Is there something im missing?
[2023-05-03T19:31:25] Jason Nelson: <photos/photo_8279@03-05-2023_19-31-25.jpg>
[2023-05-03T19:32:01] Jason Nelson: Sensorless*
[2023-05-03T19:35:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: Flying halls?
[2023-05-03T19:35:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: It should be inside the stator
[2023-05-03T19:35:27] Jason Nelson: Why is it flying?
[2023-05-03T19:35:38] Jason Nelson: This is where it's mounted on the max motor
[2023-05-03T19:35:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_8280@03-05-2023_19-35-43.jpg>
[2023-05-03T19:36:28] Jason Nelson: There's no space
[2023-05-03T19:36:38] Jason Nelson: This was just while the glue was drying
[2023-05-03T19:36:57] Jason Nelson: I pressed them down but I guess that's still not proper
[2023-05-03T19:37:07] Jason Nelson: They don't line up with the spacing though
[2023-05-03T19:37:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_8281@03-05-2023_19-37-29.jpg>
[2023-05-03T19:37:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: Here should be the sensor
[2023-05-03T19:38:18] Jason Nelson: Hmm this one that I bought they were positioned down
[2023-05-03T19:39:29] Jason Nelson: I guess you're just supposed to bend it up
[2023-05-03T19:40:10] Oreo huzky: Dual or single and what current and voltage and also what tire size
[2023-05-03T19:43:17] rosheee: 13S riksha
[2023-05-03T19:43:23] rosheee: Now testdrive
[2023-05-03T19:43:50] Thierry: Dual, 20s up to front 60/120A, rear 90/180A. 10" The speed remains the same with lower amps
[2023-05-03T19:44:15] rosheee: <video_file>
[2023-05-03T19:45:40] Thierry: Not that much. I put a lot of fw and only reached 106km/h. And it is too powerfull, not so confortable. I would recommand standard winding only for one motor config.
[2023-05-03T19:46:15] Jason Nelson: <photos/photo_8282@03-05-2023_19-46-15.jpg>

[2023-05-03T19:49:49] Jason Nelson: No temp sensor on this board
[2023-05-03T19:50:11] Oreo huzky: Ah okay
[2023-05-03T19:50:16] Thierry: Don't think so, I can increase fw but it was already at 140A.
[2023-05-03T19:50:50] Mirono escooters: Those speeds require a shitload of power
[2023-05-03T19:50:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Rest is there also
[2023-05-03T19:50:56] Mirono escooters: Even worse w fw
[2023-05-03T19:52:03] Thierry: Yes I know but these motors are slow that's a fact üò¨

[2023-05-03T19:52:41] Thierry: Was at 150A battery with max settings that I tried
[2023-05-03T19:53:11] Mirono escooters: Ah lowkv
[2023-05-03T19:54:36] Thierry: It increased from 78km/h to 106km/h with fw, don't think that I can gain much more.
[2023-05-03T19:56:14] Mirono escooters: Thats alrea alot
[2023-05-03T20:01:31] Jan: 130A FW per motor?
[2023-05-03T20:02:06] Thierry: Yes, even 140
[2023-05-03T20:03:02] Thierry: Was to test highest speed that I can reach
[2023-05-03T20:03:39] Jan: Whats max speed in freespin?
[2023-05-03T20:03:57] Thierry: Around 145
[2023-05-03T20:04:55] Jan: Hmm sounds like very low kV or weird setup
[2023-05-03T20:05:13] Thierry: Do you also have 60H? Standard?
[2023-05-03T20:07:12] Jan: 60h 22x3 as i remember

[2023-05-03T20:11:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Complete different thing,not even similar
[2023-05-03T20:11:33] Jan: 269kph freespin so far
[2023-05-03T20:12:20] Thierry: What is freespin speed without fw on 17s?

[2023-05-04T00:34:53] Unknown: Hello! There is a regularly recurring problem with my built scooter. "ABS OVER CURRENT LIMIT" returns regularly, but I don't know what else we can do to make it disappear because we have already tried many things. The motors are shaking in the start point randomly like when you dont have hall sensors, but there is any hall sensor error. Thank you in advance for your help. Ubox v2 100V/100A by spintend

[2023-05-04T11:12:32] Jan: 60/18?
[2023-05-04T11:12:46] Jan: You need to specify layout and the cell

[2023-05-04T11:14:02] Jan: 5px4.2Ahx8C= discharge current battery
[2023-05-04T11:15:01] Jan: discharge power would be (16sx3.6V)*(discharge current battery)= discharge power battery

[2023-05-04T12:27:56] Unknown: I'll ask the builder
[2023-05-04T12:29:05] Jan: If he build with complete ass chinesium cells, then 8C is not possible
[2023-05-04T12:29:35] Jan: An insane good cell like a Molicel P45B can reach more than 10C at 4500mAh
[2023-05-04T12:59:59] Tibor Kalman Zalavari: Hi, I biuld this big "Beluga". Thanks for your helps. I have a question: Is it possible that the setting is good and something suddenly changes it in the Vesc-tool? Because the settings on the PC were correct. There was also a symptom that the connected active tracking controller "by itself" has been turned off.
[2023-05-04T13:04:12] Tibor Kalman Zalavari: Yes off course. The owner (my friend Alex) used it for a long time with satisfaction. These were the original settings.
[2023-05-04T13:06:30] S1m 0n: What is me the Ubox single? Is it a good ESC? I've read the last few days that it is not so great? Or does that refer only to the non-alu version?

[2023-05-04T13:10:15] S1m 0n: Because my colleague has destroyed my Flipsky and AK has made his lisp script available, I am flirting with the Ubox single (is nice and small and since I do not want a new battery, I will stay with 13s).

[2023-05-05T22:30:12] AK: if you had something like profiles, but on buttons, what would you switch except for amps and max speed?
[2023-05-05T22:30:23] Oreo huzky: Aw okay I gotta find a way to put battery in scooter
[2023-05-05T22:30:39] Oreo huzky: I will just stand on battery ü•≤

[2023-05-05T23:13:00] AK: Good question, will have to try that
[2023-05-05T23:13:35] AK: I'd have to check if traction can switch at that moment
[2023-05-05T23:13:46] AK: traction will propably do stupid stuff in that config
[2023-05-05T23:14:41] AK: Don't bother, I have it lifted up already
[2023-05-05T23:14:56] AK: I have to spin wheels either way for testing
[2023-05-05T23:17:54] AK: I know that russians alredy have wheel disable by killswitch and can something combo, I'll look into their implementation, if your suggestion doesnt work out
[2023-05-06T00:24:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, read on timeforacing.org using translator, but for competition, you need full leather 1 piece suit with motorcycle helmet and gloves and boots
[2023-05-06T00:25:28] Oreo huzky: Oof my jacket protectüòÇ
[2023-05-06T00:28:33] Mirono escooters: Only leather? I got motorbike gear, but it's not leather.
[2023-05-06T00:28:40] Mirono escooters: Its motorbike grade tho, certified eu.
[2023-05-06T00:28:46] Mirono escooters: I can't recall brand but it's well known
[2023-05-06T00:28:56] Face de Pin Suc√©: For competition it is competition grade, meaning 1 piece suit leather

[2023-05-06T00:29:18] Mirono escooters: But I understand
[2023-05-06T00:29:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: We negociated hard to not have FIM homologation for helmets, but for the body, they were not negotiating
[2023-05-06T00:29:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: Truly, you're happy to be well protected when falling on track
[2023-05-06T00:30:04] Mirono escooters: I know
[2023-05-06T00:30:13] Mirono escooters: But I'd think motorbike gear would be fine, not leather
[2023-05-06T00:40:45] Oreo huzky: How much do these cost?
[2023-05-06T00:42:10] Mirono escooters: Full leather pack? Depends. But not cheap.

[2023-05-06T05:49:27] rosheee: but then u need sexy body
[2023-05-06T05:49:32] rosheee: me would look like fat domina
[2023-05-06T05:49:34] rosheee: XD
[2023-05-06T08:11:09] Oreo huzky: Bruh
[2023-05-06T16:09:21] puneDir: Can you switch between dual and single motor mode on vesc app?
[2023-05-06T16:11:03] puneDir: Gonna use 2 flipsky 75100
[2023-05-06T16:11:17] puneDir: Otherwise im going to buy switch
[2023-05-06T16:11:23] Ion: Not that i know of. You can set motor amps of the corresponding controller to 0
[2023-05-06T16:11:24] Finn: i guess you need to write a script for that
[2023-05-06T16:11:52] puneDir: Eh easier than button
[2023-05-06T16:11:58] puneDir: Would dual motor kill the range?
[2023-05-06T16:12:24] AK: dual motor usually increases range, if targeting same performance as when riding single
[2023-05-06T16:12:40] puneDir: Wait rlly?
[2023-05-06T16:13:04] puneDir: Will it increase if i drive like grandma?
[2023-05-06T16:13:09] AK: obv, smaller currents, no power generation by the idle motor, less heat generated
[2023-05-06T16:13:20] puneDir: Makes sense
[2023-05-06T16:13:55] puneDir: How can i connect 2 vescs
[2023-05-06T16:14:10] Mirono escooters: Can
[2023-05-06T16:14:11] Finn: through the can protocol of the vesc
[2023-05-06T16:14:26] Mirono escooters: Just read on endless sphere, pleaase
[2023-05-06T16:14:48] Ion: Also the load and heat is distributed between 2 motors and VESC
[2023-05-06T16:14:58] puneDir: Where is it
[2023-05-06T16:15:08] puneDir: Couldnt find any Info about that topic :(
[2023-05-06T16:15:15] Mirono escooters: Endless sphere is FULL
[2023-05-06T16:15:30] Mirono escooters: I bet all my money on it that there's post about it, can communication is like basic
[2023-05-06T16:15:37] Mirono escooters: Try better
[2023-05-06T16:15:38] puneDir: I mean where is endless sphere
[2023-05-06T16:16:01] Mirono escooters: Its a site -_-
[2023-05-06T16:16:16] AK: Connect two wires, can l and can h, that's it
[2023-05-06T16:16:38] puneDir: Thats it?
[2023-05-06T16:16:42] AK: Unless you have separate battaries, then also ground
[2023-05-06T16:16:45] puneDir: Sounds easy
[2023-05-06T16:16:47] puneDir: Thank you
[2023-05-06T16:17:00] puneDir: Would vesc tool show 2 devices
[2023-05-06T16:17:10] AK: Well I don't know what you expect from "connecting two vesc", that's a very broad term
[2023-05-06T16:17:12] AK: Yeah
[2023-05-06T16:17:30] puneDir: I mean for single motor
[2023-05-06T16:17:37] puneDir: my english went shit
[2023-05-06T16:17:53] AK: How would that work
[2023-05-06T16:18:03] AK: Why do you need two esc if you have 1 motor
[2023-05-06T16:18:32] Mirono escooters: Redundancy? üòù
[2023-05-06T16:20:03] puneDir: 2 vescs 2 motors
[2023-05-06T16:20:13] puneDir: One gas and one dash
[2023-05-06T16:20:40] puneDir: And one battery

[2023-05-08T11:25:56] Oreo huzky: No just solder it there is a wiring diagram on thier website
[2023-05-08T11:30:55] Rogerio Figueiredo: Very nice 45 max
[2023-05-08T11:31:11] Rogerio Figueiredo: I will change the motor to vsett
[2023-05-08T11:31:19] SirGeoff: For 3.3V, not needed anything. For 5V, yes you need a voltage level converter. (two resistors in fact)
[2023-05-08T11:31:19] Rogerio Figueiredo: I'm trying 22s now
[2023-05-08T11:52:50] Unknown: so I don't have to take any additional module to put the accelerator and the brake

[2023-05-09T01:55:10] Jason Nelson: Can anyone help me?
[2023-05-09T03:38:53] rosheee: send XML of motor configs
[2023-05-09T03:38:57] rosheee: then u get best help
[2023-05-09T04:02:31] Jason Nelson: This did it
[2023-05-09T04:03:05] Jason Nelson: This
[2023-05-09T04:03:18] Jason Nelson: Just took it on a pretty abusive ride
[2023-05-09T04:03:34] Jason Nelson: I recently replaced all my connections with bullet connectors
[2023-05-09T04:04:13] Jason Nelson: It is working perfectly from my current observations
[2023-05-09T04:04:32] Jason Nelson: Yes
[2023-05-09T04:04:37] Jason Nelson: Just did 8 miles
[2023-05-09T04:05:02] Jason Nelson: I suppose
[2023-05-09T04:05:08] Jason Nelson: Probably always my issue
[2023-05-09T04:05:39] Jason Nelson: Only one bumps though. Do you know what causes it out just how to get rid of it?
[2023-05-09T04:05:45] Jason Nelson: On*
[2023-05-09T04:21:30] Jason Nelson: It is not having any issues. I will do a group ride tomorrow all over the city, 30+ miles with my trip there and back so we will see then
[2023-05-09T04:22:10] Jason Nelson: After asking I searched the chat for ABS over current and changed those settings. It seemed to fix my issue
[2023-05-09T10:39:15] AK: Your wheel gets lifted into the air, you push max throttle - your current maxes out too quick.
[2023-05-09T13:58:00] Jason Nelson: Thank you
[2023-05-09T16:37:34] Jason Nelson: Will the controller still use the sensor as an observer while running in sensorless mode?
[2023-05-09T16:39:03] Jason Nelson: I have a sensorless motor that would clunk out if I gave it too much throttle, after I installed the hall sensor and it finally sensed the hall sensors while it was closed when I put load on it it would clunk out in Hall mode but now when I put it in sensorless mode I get full torque as zero start
[2023-05-09T16:39:13] Jason Nelson: That's why I ask
[2023-05-09T17:15:20] Happy Giraffe: Something off with the sensors or settings
[2023-05-09T17:15:57] Happy Giraffe: You might want to try the new silent hfi (requires much tuning tho)
[2023-05-09T17:37:47] Martin Kaktits: how can sensoreless know magnet location at 0 start
[2023-05-09T17:37:52] Mirono escooters: Not
[2023-05-09T17:37:56] Mirono escooters: It "guesses"
[2023-05-09T17:38:03] Mirono escooters: Hence the brtrtrt if u don't push first
[2023-05-09T17:38:16] Martin Kaktits: the hfi too?
[2023-05-09T17:38:25] Mirono escooters: Hfi is diff
[2023-05-09T17:38:34] Martin Kaktits: ok so how does hfi know
[2023-05-09T17:38:51] Mirono escooters: Idk, haven't studied it yet
[2023-05-09T17:38:52] rosheee: ^^
[2023-05-09T17:39:11] Mirono escooters: Can we just say magic?
[2023-05-09T17:39:14] Mirono escooters: Easier to explain
[2023-05-09T17:39:20] rosheee: choose "corrected position"
[2023-05-09T17:39:24] rosheee: and setup the corrected position
[2023-05-09T17:40:06] rosheee: hfi like hall sensor (most users) goes to like 700erpm (which is maybe 1-5kmh) and switches into sensorless
[2023-05-09T17:41:02] rosheee: if u choose going into sensorless then play with the sensorless settings as well and set them up for your needs
[2023-05-09T17:41:47] rosheee: also when u use HFI go below 30khz
[2023-05-09T17:42:09] rosheee: hfi pretty easy to setup when u read all "infos" in vesc tool and think a bit
[2023-05-09T17:42:24] rosheee: default start voltage is ..20V i think
[2023-05-09T17:42:33] rosheee: use laptop and RT to setup
[2023-05-09T17:43:06] rosheee: easy to start solution is use VSS
[2023-05-09T17:43:12] Happy Giraffe: It requires a more compatible motor as Vedder said something about the Lt-Lq compared to total inductance must not be too small
[2023-05-09T17:43:22] rosheee: when u master VSS switch to HFI
[2023-05-09T17:43:46] rosheee: word but works with vsett and the 60h we use
[2023-05-09T17:44:07] rosheee: i set HFI -> SENSORLESS switch to 70'000erpm ^^
[2023-05-09T17:44:12] Happy Giraffe: <animation>
[2023-05-09T17:46:14] rosheee: so works nP
[2023-05-09T17:46:23] rosheee: but laptop recommended for setup
[2023-05-09T17:47:19] rosheee: ^^' when test HFI also test startup up/on a hill
[2023-05-09T17:49:39] Mirono escooters: Im old-school using halls
[2023-05-09T17:50:26] puneDir: Why dont use halls
[2023-05-09T17:50:32] puneDir: No point of sensorless
[2023-05-09T17:52:00] Jason Nelson: Some motors don't come with halls and have to be installed, it's another part to fail as well
[2023-05-09T17:52:02] Happy Giraffe: Somehow straight starting from FOC seems like a good option too
[2023-05-09T17:52:02] Mirono escooters: Some motors dont habe Or are killed halls
[2023-05-09T17:52:51] puneDir: Yeah sensorless is 2nd option
[2023-05-09T17:53:10] Jason Nelson: My motor has no hall sensor stock and no space in between the stators for it. I had to file them out and even when I made them perfectly flush to the stators it still didn't sense position properly, maybe need to tune the settings
[2023-05-09T17:53:59] Jason Nelson: But after installing the sensor sensorless works with no stutter at all
[2023-05-09T17:54:24] Martin Kaktits: omg yes, i have had problems with motors abd its always halls. Some just randomly die, sometimes u brake the lil wire
[2023-05-09T17:54:52] Jason Nelson: Hfi allows more room for a wider cable I would think
[2023-05-09T17:54:59] Martin Kaktits: also
[2023-05-09T17:55:07] Jason Nelson: Many reasons
[2023-05-09T17:57:00] Martin Kaktits: or space in axle for active liquid cooling tube ü§™
[2023-05-09T17:57:35] Jason Nelson: I think impractical. Ferrofluid is sufficient
[2023-05-09T17:57:49] rosheee: ^^ i wanna see screenshots of the hall setup of ya guys üòÉ when going sensorless? 700erpm? 2500?
[2023-05-09T17:58:54] Jason Nelson: Mine is set to 300
[2023-05-09T18:00:56] rosheee: but foc(hall) -> then it goes sensorless ^^ or u set hall to 60'000 erpm
[2023-05-09T18:02:59] rosheee: <photos/photo_8335@09-05-2023_18-02-59.jpg>
[2023-05-09T18:04:34] rosheee: i think most who use "phase filter" use default max erpm
[2023-05-09T18:05:35] rosheee: and btw: if you manually do the "FOC DETECTION" and it shows sky high resistance n shit just activate "high current sampling mode" in foc -> advanced
[2023-05-09T18:07:02] rosheee: and when doing hardcore setup shizzleria play with the values @jamessoderstrom mentioned
[2023-05-09T18:07:14] rosheee: <photos/photo_8336@09-05-2023_18-07-14.jpg>
[2023-05-09T18:07:29] rosheee: and check then @ realtime data + sampled data
[2023-05-09T18:08:17] rosheee: if you have a friend and test with load activate server mod on your phone and your friend can connect with his laptop and check real time and adjust the values for best fuckeria

[2023-05-11T08:07:42] Unknown: Yes someone told me that the ubox is more for onewheel and the flipsky for escots I need a vesc for escot
[2023-05-11T08:49:25] sombre_enfant: I did that sum weeek ago most of stuff is from Izuna https://t.me/vescinfo
[2023-05-11T10:08:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I think what he meant was that they are different in performance. 75200 is quite big and therefore more powerful, while you can compare the ubox 100v100a to a 75100.
[2023-05-11T10:59:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I was looking on it scrolling over and we build a few with screen mod but never used caps ,still unsure what you achive from there at that point
[2023-05-11T11:01:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also that plug for the 75100 ,i dont really get
[2023-05-11T11:34:36] sombre_enfant: Can you clearly explain ? I showed off 2 solution about the caps and pull down, they only here to avoid the thing crash mid ride

[2023-05-11T12:47:59] Dan Dean: sorry for my Englis
[2023-05-11T12:48:27] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: You might be using the VESC App from the Play Store which automatically updates or at some point updated it yourself. This makes you show this information, which requires you to upgrade your VESC as well.
[2023-05-11T12:48:28] Dan Dean: i whant to config to ather motor that why i try to conect
[2023-05-11T12:49:24] Dan Dean: so if i will conect to PC it myet be ok?
[2023-05-11T12:49:42] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Depends what VESC Tool Version you have on your PC.
[2023-05-11T12:49:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: You can just update your VESC via the app.
[2023-05-11T12:50:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Only make sure to store the motor&app configuration before by exporting to XML.
[2023-05-11T12:50:36] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: or downgrade your app on your smartphone/pc.
[2023-05-11T12:50:55] Dan Dean: that what i try, but i cant conect to veasc
[2023-05-11T12:51:09] Dan Dean: TNX allot i will try it
[2023-05-11T12:51:36] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Huh?
[2023-05-11T12:51:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Just click OK, go to firmware and update it. It should not keep you from being connected.
[2023-05-11T12:52:03] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It only doesn't let you configure motor parameters because of mismatching app and vesc fw version.

[2023-05-11T22:22:54] rosheee: To connect a throttle and power button to a VESC (Vedder Electronic Speed Controller), you can refer to the official documentation, online forums, or community resources dedicated to VESC. VESC Official Documentation: The VESC project has its own official documentation that provides detailed information on how to connect various components. You can find the documentation at the following website: https://vesc-project.com/ Online Forums and Communities: There are several online forums and communities where VESC users share their experiences and knowledge. Two popular communities are: Electric Skateboard Builders Forum: This forum is focused on electric skateboard builders and enthusiasts, and it has a dedicated section for VESC-related discussions. You can visit their website at: https://electric-skateboard.builders/ VESC Project Forum: The official VESC Project Forum is another valuable resource where you can find information, ask questions, and get support directly from the VESC community. The forum can be accessed at: https://vesc-project.com/nodebb/ YouTube Tutorials: YouTube is a great platform for finding video tutorials that demonstrate the process of connecting a throttle and power button to a VESC. Searching for "VESC throttle and power button connection" or similar keywords should yield relevant results. When using online resources, make sure to cross-reference the information you find and consider the version of VESC you are using, as there may be slight variations in the connection process depending on the specific model or firmware version. Remember to exercise caution and follow safety guidelines when working with electrical components. If you're not confident in your abilities or have limited experience, it's advisable to consult an expert or seek professional assistance to ensure proper and safe connections.
[2023-05-11T22:23:10] rosheee: and now
[2023-05-11T22:23:11] rosheee: HERE
[2023-05-11T22:23:23] rosheee: i send u PM
[2023-05-11T22:23:36] rosheee: To connect a throttle to a Flipsky 75100 ESC (Electronic Speed Controller), you'll need to follow these general steps: 1. Identify the throttle and ESC pins: The Flipsky 75100 ESC should have labeled pins for the throttle connection. Look for pins labeled "TH" or "T" for the throttle signal. 2. Determine the throttle type: Flipsky ESCs support different types of throttles, such as PPM (Pulse-Width Modulation) or UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter). Identify the type of throttle you have and ensure compatibility with the ESC. 3. Connect PPM throttle: a. If you have a PPM throttle, you'll need a PPM cable or a servo cable with a male connector on one end and female connector(s) on the other end. b. Connect the male end of the PPM cable to the throttle output of your throttle device (e.g., remote control receiver). c. Connect the female end of the PPM cable to the "TH" or "T" pin of the Flipsky 75100 ESC. 4. Connect UART throttle: a. If you have a UART throttle, you'll need a UART cable or wires with the appropriate connectors. b. Connect the appropriate wires or connectors of the UART cable to the respective UART pins of the throttle and ESC. 5. Power supply: a. Ensure that your Flipsky 75100 ESC is connected to a suitable power source, such as a battery. b. Make sure the power supply is within the voltage range specified for the ESC. 6. Additional connections: a. Depending on your setup, you may need to connect other components, such as a power button or an anti-spark switch, to the appropriate pins on the Flipsky 75100 ESC. Refer to the ESC's documentation or consult the Flipsky support for specific instructions. 7. Test and calibrate: Once all the connections are made, power on the system and test the throttle response. It's crucial to calibrate the throttle according to the ESC's instructions to ensure proper operation. Please note that these instructions are a general guideline, and the specific pin configuration or requirements may vary depending on the Flipsky 75100 ESC version or firmware. Always refer to the official documentation, user manual, or contact Flipsky support for accurate and up-to-date information.

[2023-05-13T04:35:00] rosheee: XD ok
[2023-05-13T10:20:14] Happy Giraffe: People should just chill, if you are not a big company its a risk and costs a ton to develope and make a productüòÖ Then you have warranty etc. software support, updates
[2023-05-13T10:21:12] Happy Giraffe: Obviously its a luxury item and people with a stable income jobs can afford if wanted
[2023-05-13T10:22:36] Happy Giraffe: Even if Spintend manufactures it , I wonder if end user cost could be even close to 350‚Ç¨üåö
[2023-05-13T10:32:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt think so
[2023-05-13T10:34:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: They can sell it for less than 100‚Ç¨, obviously I mean anything excluding engineering. China don‚Äôt care if you pay tax or not , their workers are underpaid, they need just hardware, and produce it 1000 pieces
[2023-05-13T10:34:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt know how much the board cost, but Chinese company can have very very cheap prices

[2023-05-13T11:57:03] rosheee: ok
[2023-05-13T11:57:08] rosheee: shiteria doesn't make sens now XD
[2023-05-13T11:57:35] rosheee: now both 20S front wheel SUPER FAST TORQUE AND ALL SHIT ON BOTH and rear not even if same settings (except FOC detection)
[2023-05-13T11:58:03] rosheee: FAPSKY?

[2023-05-13T11:58:31] rosheee: what u've done?
[2023-05-13T11:59:26] Konstantin: Not me, friend...full battery... Mid speed, hard brake...mcu can't stop it and voltage rise to fast...bummm:)
[2023-05-13T12:00:12] rosheee: without ebrake shizzleria?
[2023-05-13T12:00:23] Konstantin: I told him , full battery and hard recuperation...bad idea...but who cares about us :))
[2023-05-13T12:01:03] Konstantin: When fets blows... brake was assume! He fly;!)))
[2023-05-13T12:01:10] Konstantin: xD

[2023-05-13T12:07:00] sombre_enfant: Wait i have a fartbrain could it be added to lisp script or setting a disable of e-brake till a certain voltage or its already in vesc tool ?
[2023-05-13T12:14:17] AK: Looks like bms closed, not controllers fault
[2023-05-13T12:14:28] AK: Who would have guessed
[2023-05-13T12:51:38] Happy Giraffe: But ofcourse developers cut is needed to keep family fed and house running + all other expenses and taxes
[2023-05-13T13:23:30] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Why is using 23s and recuperation lol Didnt user know that 23s only without recup?
[2023-05-13T13:23:54] Mirono escooters: Yeah, weird
[2023-05-13T13:24:15] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Emf and bemf is summed in esc when ebraking
[2023-05-13T13:24:22] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Please, explain it to him
[2023-05-13T13:24:54] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: So it can be +10-20-30V in esc when hard braking
[2023-05-13T13:25:46] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, but it works fine until 23s
[2023-05-13T13:25:51] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Only without ebrake
[2023-05-13T13:25:59] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 21s-22s maybe with a little brake
[2023-05-13T13:26:16] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: It can
[2023-05-13T13:26:22] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But this
[2023-05-13T13:27:14] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes ofc
[2023-05-13T13:27:24] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You need to do research of a board
[2023-05-13T14:00:21] Happy Giraffe: 13s batt with strong ebrake on 16s rated Ubox 75v been very fine tho if using high phase currents it gives some sort of a vibration if prolonged ebraking
[2023-05-13T15:16:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I use 75100 alu at 22s daily (makerbase tho, but same as flipsky anyway). Not using E-Brake because of the voltage.
[2023-05-13T20:53:55] Unknown: so not ot give the brake too much power ??
[2023-05-13T20:54:21] Unknown: how much amp to draw from battery for result of 65kmh under a64kg rider with hub motor 1200w (zero10x) and how much phase amps ?
[2023-05-13T20:55:54] Mirono escooters: Around 1800w
[2023-05-13T20:56:36] Unknown: the brake ?
[2023-05-13T20:57:43] Mirono escooters: Brake? I thought you wanted to know how much to get to 65kmh
[2023-05-13T21:03:13] Unknown: How much amp to give not w if you can help me and it is an electric scooter just so you know
[2023-05-13T21:05:22] Mirono escooters: V√óA= W

[2023-05-13T21:19:56] puneDir: https://github.com/SolidGeek/VescUart
[2023-05-13T21:20:06] puneDir: cant get this vvork
[2023-05-13T21:20:25] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Check for forks
[2023-05-13T21:21:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But this library should work. At least it worked for me some time ago.
[2023-05-13T21:22:11] puneDir: Compilation error: 'VescUart' does not name a type; did you mean 'getchar'?
[2023-05-13T21:22:16] puneDir: keep getting this error
[2023-05-13T21:22:26] puneDir: plus im doing it correctly
[2023-05-13T21:24:01] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: XD
[2023-05-13T21:27:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: How about you show us your code.

[2023-05-13T21:30:52] Mirono escooters: .. :( and you did it correctly?
[2023-05-13T21:30:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yeah great, but how do you have the library imported
[2023-05-13T21:31:11] puneDir: i also tested premade codes
[2023-05-13T21:31:48] puneDir: <photos/photo_8374@13-05-2023_21-31-48.jpg>
[2023-05-13T21:34:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Any info in which file this error occurs?
[2023-05-13T21:35:31] puneDir: C:\Users\G√∂rkem\Downloads\vesc_data\vesc_data.ino:15:1: error: 'VescUart' does not name a type; did you mean 'getchar'?C:\Users\G√∂rkem\Downloads\vesc_data\vesc_data.ino: In function 'void setup()': C:\Users\G√∂rkem\Downloads\vesc_data\vesc_data.ino:19:3: error: 'UART' was not declared in this scopeC:\Users\G√∂rkem\Downloads\vesc_data\vesc_data.ino:19:3: note: suggested alternative: 'UDR0' C:\Users\G√∂rkem\Downloads\vesc_data\vesc_data.ino: In function 'void loop()':C:\Users\G√∂rkem\Downloads\vesc_data\vesc_data.ino:28:17: error: 'UART' was not declared in this scope C:\Users\G√∂rkem\Downloads\vesc_data\vesc_data.ino:28:17: note: suggested alternative: 'UDR0'
[2023-05-13T21:36:12] puneDir: hmm lemme fix this
[2023-05-13T21:40:13] puneDir: https://www.instructables.com/VESC-Telemetry-Display/
[2023-05-13T21:40:24] puneDir: i tried this code and get the same error
[2023-05-13T21:47:24] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: There has to be something wrong with the way you import the library. I can only guess, but vesc_data.ino is a file created from you and it clearly states in the error that UART was not declared, which is likely due to the fact that "VescUart" does not name a type which is likely due to the fact that the library is not picked up correctly.
[2023-05-13T21:47:54] puneDir: im going to try re import the library
[2023-05-13T21:48:02] puneDir: but i already did fevv times
[2023-05-13T21:48:07] puneDir: idk vvhats vvrong
[2023-05-13T21:49:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: For me it was working perfectly. There are also a few forks I can recommend depending on which features you need: https://github.com/billwurles/VescUart/ - added support for set/getMcConfValues https://github.com/finallyfunctional/VescUart - this I used already once, not much of a difference besides handbrake current function and fix for esp32 compilation
[2023-05-13T21:50:01] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but these librares are old and shit. But I don't know any other which are more up-to-date and I had no reason so far making my own yet.
[2023-05-13T21:50:48] puneDir: i need that screen
[2023-05-13T21:50:56] puneDir: gonna make it vvork somehpv
[2023-05-13T21:52:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But ChatGPT won't bring you far. I can already see code that does not exist. "UART.init()" does not exist. https://github.com/SolidGeek/VescUart/blob/master/src/VescUart.cpp There is no init function.
[2023-05-13T21:52:46] puneDir: yup
[2023-05-13T21:52:50] puneDir: fuck that code
[2023-05-13T21:52:57] puneDir: gonna edit something already exist
[2023-05-13T21:54:30] puneDir: i cant see vesc uart library on installed libraries
[2023-05-13T21:54:50] puneDir: <photos/photo_8375@13-05-2023_21-54-50.jpg>
[2023-05-13T21:54:58] puneDir: But its installed
[2023-05-13T21:55:19] puneDir: <photos/photo_8376@13-05-2023_21-55-19.jpg>
[2023-05-13T21:55:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Might try using PlatformIO on VS Code instead of Arduino IDE. Arduino IDE sucks.
[2023-05-13T22:02:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: tested it with a old project of mine and works just fine on PlatformIO. But I remember using Arduino IDE as well and having no issues.
[2023-05-13T22:02:57] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <photos/photo_8378@13-05-2023_22-02-57.jpg>
[2023-05-13T22:03:45] puneDir: im going to try that
[2023-05-13T22:06:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Depending on which Arduino you are using you have to adjust the following but in my case it was a copy knockoff Arduino Nano. platformio.ini [env:test] platform = atmelavr board = nanoatmega328new framework = arduino lib_deps = finallyfunctional/VescUart@^1.1.1 But makes sense to take a look a the documentation: https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/projectconf/index.html
[2023-05-13T22:07:32] puneDir: mines is pro mini clone
[2023-05-13T22:08:01] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Can be easily adjusted via the interface anyway.

[2023-05-14T00:05:14] puneDir: This arduino code is good
[2023-05-14T00:05:33] puneDir: All you need is ssd1306 spi screen and arduino nano
[2023-05-14T00:05:36] puneDir: pretty good

[2023-05-14T00:06:11] puneDir: maybe someone would use it like me
[2023-05-14T02:25:22] Unknown: How complicated is to do for someone who only now starting in Arduino and vesc ?
[2023-05-14T02:43:52] Unknown: Asked for a list of products to make this display Me I need a list of products to make this display ChatGPT Sure, here's a list of products that you can use to make the VESC telemetry display based on Arduino: Arduino UNO R3 or compatible board Adafruit ILI9341 2.8" TFT Display or compatible display JST-SH 6-pin connector or compatible connector for VESC communication Jumper wires for connecting the components together Breadboard or PCB for prototyping and testing USB cable for programming and power supply You can find all of these products on popular online stores like Amazon, eBay, or AliExpress. Make sure to check the specifications and compatibility of each component before purchasing
[2023-05-14T04:07:46] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Stop spamming this chat with code. It's not even practical to read like that. Send normal file or use a paste website.
[2023-05-14T04:09:57] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Hmm still running too hot, need to do my standardized test ride to tell if it changed anything at all. Might be cooling off a little faster, but the difference between case and temp sensor was still huge. Might have not put enough Statorade, don't know...
[2023-05-14T05:57:36] rosheee: wtf
[2023-05-14T05:57:58] rosheee: anyone had similar problem maybe ^^'? rear wheel goes 200kmh freespin front 300kmh on both of our 20S's with my settings ^^'
[2023-05-14T05:58:38] rosheee: can't full send 20S cuz front wheel still no grip/spin at 110kmh

[2023-05-14T19:01:39] Thierry: Thanks
[2023-05-14T19:04:45] Thierry: I remember that few people burned mosfet after bms turn off discharge. I happened several time last days and did not burn any thing. Maybe it was updated on fw or I'm more lucky
[2023-05-14T19:04:56] Mirono escooters: Different hardware
[2023-05-14T19:05:59] AK: Usually you burn stuff when bms cuts CHARGE, not discharge
[2023-05-14T19:06:26] AK: Cutting discharge from battery is 99,9% harmless unless you are on a monowheel
[2023-05-14T19:06:31] AK: Then help you god
[2023-05-14T19:07:07] Mirono escooters: I'd be so scared

[2023-05-14T19:10:07] Thierry: This one burn because mosfet case touched each other on a jump üòÖ
[2023-05-14T19:10:18] Thierry: They are so near to each other
[2023-05-14T20:03:10] Konstantin: 99% 100n... Or 10n ;)))
[2023-05-14T20:08:30] Thierry: It is 20nF
[2023-05-14T20:08:58] Mirono escooters: U measuring the 1 or possibly others parallel?
[2023-05-14T20:09:08] Mirono escooters: Eh, problably only 1
[2023-05-14T20:09:39] Thierry: I measured the one I unsolder and finally found out

[2023-05-15T17:34:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Not sure. My Blade got a little rusty inside on the edges and the two 60H I opened were only slightly sealed with glue (if that was even the purpose of it...?) but I doubt that it would have kept water from getting inside, but besides that cable axle etc all sealed well.

[2023-05-16T15:18:23] Mirono escooters: ü§å
[2023-05-16T15:18:42] Diego: Exactly
[2023-05-16T15:18:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: For a decent engine , minimum is 200‚Ç¨. Under this price you found just shit like Monorim motor
[2023-05-16T15:19:37] Diego: Is the monorim worse than the 300w pro 2? In terms of build quality
[2023-05-16T15:20:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Surly
[2023-05-16T15:20:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Surly

[2023-05-16T15:21:55] Mirono escooters: Kugoo 500w is semi ok especially for budget people like moi
[2023-05-16T15:22:32] Diego: I am looking for a product to purchase. Without knowing how to evaluate a good engine versus a bad one, I'm ignorant about it. I should go deeper or ask you to recommend a good engine
[2023-05-16T15:23:15] Mirono escooters: I ran it for years on my Xiaomi, plenty power , build well. Many friends followed me.
[2023-05-16T15:23:26] Diego: The only thing I can tell you about the setup is that I want to use it with a 13s to 17s battery
[2023-05-16T15:23:47] Mirono escooters: Medium kv should work, depending on speed u want
[2023-05-16T15:23:49] Mirono escooters: And batt power
[2023-05-16T15:24:05] Diego: And that I don't need to go over 55 kmh
[2023-05-16T15:24:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: M4 one?
[2023-05-16T15:24:33] Mirono escooters: Ah, low to medium kv then

[2023-05-16T15:25:29] Mirono escooters: Hmm, 23-25 I'd say
[2023-05-16T15:25:38] Mirono escooters: 10"
[2023-05-16T15:26:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: With xiaomi esc that works nice,with vesc would say weak ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇbut only tried in air
[2023-05-16T15:26:10] Diego: The size of the circle is 10 inches and the kv 23-25?
[2023-05-16T15:26:24] Mirono escooters: Size tire
[2023-05-16T15:26:45] Mirono escooters: 500w is ofcourse not powerful But it pushed me with plenty power
[2023-05-16T15:26:51] Mirono escooters: And thiccer cst tire is upgrade
[2023-05-16T15:27:00] Mirono escooters: I ferrofluided to be accurate
[2023-05-16T15:27:35] Mirono escooters: For 60‚Ç¨? Or whatever, you really can't complain Cheaper then monoshit brake cover, and you get a whole better engine for it
[2023-05-16T15:27:55] Diego: At the moment I'm delving into the resistor mod on the original esc and to take advantage of the discovery of vesc I was looking for a motor that went well with both controllers. I know the original of the pro 2 may not fit even when going above 15s. Or at least I know there's better...
[2023-05-16T15:28:12] Mirono escooters: Well, u will have to use not much power
[2023-05-16T15:28:24] Mirono escooters: Any motor w 120* halls work w Xiaomi
[2023-05-16T15:28:35] Mirono escooters: And even 60* works beta w xiaodash
[2023-05-16T15:28:44] Mirono escooters: New G30 is 60*
[2023-05-16T15:30:17] Diego: Thank you very much thank you very much
[2023-05-16T15:30:51] Mirono escooters: :-)
[2023-05-16T15:32:34] Diego: Always an ignorant question. 120 stands for? What unit of measure?
[2023-05-16T15:32:51] Mirono escooters: Degree
[2023-05-16T15:33:10] Diego: Ahh üòÅ

[2023-05-17T07:52:49] Unknown: What do you get to know from checking resistance ?
[2023-05-17T10:49:09] rosheee: The resistance of a brushless direct current (BLDC) motor provides information about the electrical resistance of the windings in the motor. This resistance is measured in ohms and is an important parameter for characterizing the motor. The resistance of a BLDC motor depends on several factors including the number of windings, the gauge of the wire and the length of the windings. Lower resistance usually means the motor is more efficient, since less electrical energy is converted to heat. Higher resistance can indicate lower efficiency and suggest that more energy is being dissipated in the form of heat. The resistance of a BLDC motor can also be used to calculate the current that will flow through the motor when a specific voltage is applied. Ohm's law (current = voltage / resistance) can be used to find the current flowing through the motor when the voltage is known. However, it is important to note that resistance alone is not enough to fully evaluate the performance of a BLDC motor. There are many other important parameters such as torque, speed, no-load current and efficiency that should also be considered to get a complete picture of the motor.

[2023-05-17T13:47:53] Mirono escooters: I don't answer when I am not sure of myself.
[2023-05-17T13:48:35] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: It just tells how low/high resistance is and how much heat will dissipate
[2023-05-17T13:50:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You would need a spining double multimeter measurements to get all data ,but i am damn lazy for that ,kinda
[2023-05-17T13:52:35] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Chatgpt knows weped and knows numo slack, but tells that slack is a good coffee house lol

[2023-05-17T21:06:08] Unknown: Hi! I was invited by someone who said you guys could help me with sonething
[2023-05-17T21:06:39] Mirono escooters: Hi
[2023-05-17T21:07:05] Unknown: What‚Äôs the best Ninebot MAX gen 2 setup under 1200‚Ç¨ or about 1300$?
[2023-05-17T21:07:36] Mirono escooters: A vsett rear motor, ubox single alu, and a big battery
[2023-05-17T21:07:51] Unknown: Suspension?
[2023-05-17T21:09:04] Unknown: Already got recommended a vsett with ferrofluid, a ubox and a handmade battery
[2023-05-17T21:09:56] AK: buy my ninebot, I am bored of it, 800 eur if you pick it up total
[2023-05-17T21:09:59] AK: <animation>
[2023-05-17T21:10:18] Unknown: Lul sry, i hold mine near and dear
[2023-05-17T21:10:53] Mirono escooters: Sharkset
[2023-05-17T21:11:06] Mirono escooters: Yessir
[2023-05-17T21:11:37] Unknown: Was thinking of that as well but asked just in case theres a better option but i agree, its a good set
[2023-05-17T21:12:18] Unknown: Also, how easy is it to make a G30‚Ä¶ Dual motored?
[2023-05-17T21:13:43] Ion: Specs?
[2023-05-17T21:14:16] Jason Nelson: I think you can use the p65 fork to mount a motor
[2023-05-17T21:14:21] AK: vsett 10 motor, sharing suspension, monorim in the rear, 100v100 ubox, 16s
[2023-05-17T21:15:15] Unknown: Is there something special to it or why does it have to be a P65?
[2023-05-17T21:15:32] Jason Nelson: P65 is wider and has a disk brake mount
[2023-05-17T21:15:50] Jason Nelson: G30 fork is only wide enough to fit the mono rim motor from what I understand
[2023-05-17T21:15:57] Jason Nelson: Without alteration
[2023-05-17T21:16:15] Unknown: K
[2023-05-17T21:16:37] Unknown: But do i really need a second dashboard if i wanna have dual
[2023-05-17T21:16:43] Jason Nelson: I have heard of people bending the fork to fit a motor inside
[2023-05-17T21:17:35] Jason Nelson: There is a writing diagram to run it off of 1 dashboard, I do not know how
[2023-05-17T21:17:40] Jason Nelson: Wiring
[2023-05-17T21:17:53] Unknown: Also what would you recommend for a custom made battery? Like cells, bag etc.
[2023-05-17T21:17:56] AK: that is nothing to do with vesc
[2023-05-17T21:18:45] Unknown: Rly, i saw a tutorial (there arent many and theyre quite bad) where the guy installed two dashes
[2023-05-17T21:19:03] Jan: Just use Vesc with phone
[2023-05-17T21:19:12] Jason Nelson: You're going to get booted if you keep talking about things that don't pertain to vesc
[2023-05-17T21:19:26] AK: No offense, I don't care what you saw
[2023-05-17T21:19:29] Jason Nelson: There is a max mod group
[2023-05-17T21:19:46] AK: I tell you how things are, if you don't want to know, don't ask
[2023-05-17T21:19:51] Unknown: Oh sry just realised that this wasnt the modding group haha
[2023-05-17T21:20:04] Unknown: Umm‚Ä¶ can someone link me there lul
[2023-05-17T21:20:06] AK: Two dashboards is only relevant for stock hardware
[2023-05-17T21:20:14] AK: with vesc you dont need any dashboard at all
[2023-05-17T21:20:20] Jan: https://t.me/g30mod
[2023-05-17T21:20:35] AK: Still 24 7 punedir posting

[2023-05-17T21:21:13] Jan: If he cant figure out how to use google and chatgpt he is gonna get kicked for asking too much basic questions
[2023-05-17T21:21:31] AK: @ me when he is booted, the group looked good
[2023-05-18T01:33:16] Diego: Is this one of your engines?

[2023-05-18T10:16:34] Ofek üê•: You can't üòÖ If you go for DIY stuff gonna break, it's part of the process
[2023-05-18T10:25:45] rosheee: read read read read think think think
[2023-05-18T10:38:20] rosheee: then maybe burn
[2023-05-18T10:38:29] rosheee: then improve
[2023-05-18T10:38:32] rosheee: and spend $$$$$$$$$$
[2023-05-18T10:46:34] Unknown: So you are saying I was better of buying the cheapest one for training?
[2023-05-18T10:47:34] rosheee: no
[2023-05-18T10:47:41] rosheee: buy quality
[2023-05-18T10:47:47] rosheee: but then read better^^
[2023-05-18T10:49:28] Mirono escooters: Yes and we here to help
[2023-05-18T10:56:19] Unknown: I know that you shouldn't set e brake too high and flipsky doesn't support phase filtering so far

[2023-05-18T20:49:42] Mirono escooters: Well, he showed a antspark lol
[2023-05-18T20:53:29] Mirono escooters: Idk if its latching button
[2023-05-18T20:53:34] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Also you can search here info by words or phrases. There are a lot of info were spoken here
[2023-05-18T20:53:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: My friend connected the anti spark, clicked button and exploded
[2023-05-18T20:54:09] Mirono escooters: Why am I not surprised
[2023-05-18T20:54:26] Mirono escooters: Search button is very powerful on telegram
[2023-05-18T20:54:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: Antispark, vesc still alive
[2023-05-18T20:56:48] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Antispark key has its own voltage and current breakdown

[2023-05-18T21:13:41] AK: Not necessarily, you can still use a button
[2023-05-18T21:13:57] AK: Just need some soldering skills and basic electronics comprehension
[2023-05-18T21:14:46] AK: Really curious, why they don't do that themselves, literally 1 connector additional cost
[2023-05-18T21:14:57] AK: To sell the bullshit "antisparks"?
[2023-05-18T21:15:55] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-05-18T21:16:03] Mirono escooters: Its all to sell antispark
[2023-05-18T21:34:37] Face de Pin Suc√©: Because Flipsky
[2023-05-19T01:15:50] Diego: Mirono when you talk about 120 degree angles in bldc motors are you referring to the portion of the circumference of the magnets that the 3 sensors "occupy/control" at the same time?
[2023-05-19T01:26:21] Mirono escooters: No, they are too close together to mean the circumference
[2023-05-19T01:26:49] Mirono escooters: 120* has all 3 oriented to same side 60* middle is rotated around, afaik I'm no expert sadly
[2023-05-19T06:44:40] AK: It's about angle difference between the halls, when exactly they triggrr
[2023-05-19T06:45:03] AK: <photos/photo_8411@19-05-2023_06-45-03.jpg>

[2023-05-19T07:26:31] S1m 0n: What exactly are 60 & 120¬∞ for ? Are there advantages & disadvantages ?
[2023-05-19T07:27:17] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: https://community.parker.com/technologies/electromechanical-group/electromechanical---industrial/w/electromechanical-knowledge-base/174/general---hall-sensors-60-vs-120degrees this shows the difference pretty good I think
[2023-05-19T07:29:18] AK: Did you just repost my link
[2023-05-19T07:29:26] S1m 0n: I did not ask about the difference, but about the advantages & disadvantages. Is a shorter signal better than a longer one?
[2023-05-19T07:29:54] AK: None whatsoever
[2023-05-19T07:30:07] AK: You can just do the one way or the other
[2023-05-19T07:30:13] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: onoooooo
[2023-05-19T07:31:16] S1m 0n: There must be a reason why two techniques have been developed?
[2023-05-19T07:34:06] AK: Think of it as of on which side of the road to drive, just different people in different companies doing stuff "their way", propably at the same time preventing engines of the competing companies from working with their escs.
[2023-05-19T13:29:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Guys, how does tcp connection work in vesc tool for remote settings editing? What do you need to click on the server and client on the main page in the vesc tool to make a connection with each other?
[2023-05-19T13:33:09] rosheee: ^^
[2023-05-19T13:33:25] rosheee: U write then something about me on GT2 project after oldsql vesc help and ferrofluid and that me is copycat?

[2023-05-19T13:34:22] rosheee: Press xonnect server
[2023-05-19T13:34:41] rosheee: Then set same stuff on client
[2023-05-19T13:34:46] rosheee: Thrn ptess connect as client

[2023-05-19T13:45:42] rosheee: <animation>
[2023-05-19T13:46:08] rosheee: Was just sad that u mentioned paolo and not jan, or me after help or the vesc channel
[2023-05-19T13:50:00] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Sorry, I ran out of word limit in the post.. even with telegram premium :( There are other people that I didn't get to mention. And it is impossible to remove unnecessary basic information without the consent of the team
[2023-05-19T14:36:12] Diego: I said so because I read this article https://www.digikey.it/it/blog/using-bldc-hall-sensors-as-position-encoders-part-1#:~:text=Alcuni%20motori%20BLDC%20(motori%20c.c.,delle%20bobine%20magnetiche%20dello%20statore.
[2023-05-19T18:25:16] Unknown: Is it possible to use different sized motors with 2x vesc. Like 1200w motor and 500w?
[2023-05-19T18:25:32] Mirono escooters: Yes but not ideal
[2023-05-19T18:25:46] Mirono escooters: Especially when kv is different
[2023-05-19T19:17:42] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You can, but be sure to have atleast same kv. 1200w on rear and 500w on front
[2023-05-19T19:21:28] Mirono escooters: If diff kV it'll act as a load instead of helping above x speed xD
[2023-05-19T19:34:16] Unknown: So it would be as powerful as 2x 500w?
[2023-05-19T19:39:15] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Motors dont do anything by themselves. The escs takes power from your battery and convert it to motors
[2023-05-19T20:37:57] Mirono escooters: I still remember this group hzving like 30 ppl
[2023-05-19T20:38:02] Mirono escooters: I feel old
[2023-05-19T21:39:24] Martin Kaktits: its not much, but my first experience with atual vesc, hands on ü§óü§ó vsett motor + tronic 250 üï∫

[2023-05-20T13:18:06] Martin Kaktits: tell me again, how do i turn this thing off? As soon as i plug in batt its just ON
[2023-05-20T13:18:06] Martin Kaktits: <photos/photo_8415@20-05-2023_13-18-06.jpg>
[2023-05-20T13:28:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: You can turn it off by button
[2023-05-20T13:28:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: But without the button is default on
[2023-05-20T13:29:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Probably ground and swich pin shorted turn off ,but yes as you said button needed
[2023-05-20T13:31:41] Martin Kaktits: i dont have button at the moment. I want to just simulate button with manually touching wires
[2023-05-20T13:31:48] Martin Kaktits: i plan to use relay and key swith anyway
[2023-05-20T13:34:16] Mirono escooters: Use such a 433mhz relay :)
[2023-05-20T13:34:21] Mirono escooters: Then u have cool wireless button
[2023-05-20T13:34:49] Martin Kaktits: yea baby, ground + switch does it

[2023-05-21T01:51:24] casainho: hi
[2023-05-21T01:51:57] casainho: can you guys tell me the best direct channel for me to contact the VESC firmware developers??
[2023-05-21T03:55:16] rosheee: XD for what?
[2023-05-21T03:55:24] rosheee: if u ask then better not contact
[2023-05-21T03:55:29] rosheee: www.vesc-project.com
[2023-05-21T03:55:39] rosheee: then write in forum
[2023-05-21T03:56:11] casainho: I would like to ask if is possible to add a command to set the motor target speed, for having the speed controller working AS ALSO set the max current
[2023-05-21T03:56:34] casainho: just found that there is a CAN command to set only the max current
[2023-05-21T03:57:02] casainho: so I am now adding a command to set the target speed RPM and also set the max current
[2023-05-21T03:57:26] casainho: this is important for an EScooter application
[2023-05-21T03:57:42] casainho: with throttle control both the speed and motor torque
[2023-05-21T03:58:02] casainho: if this command I am adding works, then I will submit a pull request on github
[2023-05-21T03:59:37] casainho: so, I am using a ESP32-S3 running Python firmware (CircuitPyhton) and interfacing with VESC using UART
[2023-05-21T04:00:11] casainho: I read the throttle and then map the throttle position to VESC current, by sending the UART command COMM_SET_RPM
[2023-05-21T04:00:41] casainho: or, the same but sending COMM_SET_CURRENT if I prefer to control the motor torque
[2023-05-21T04:01:48] Juice: Isn't there a command to push whole motor config which includes those missing parameters?
[2023-05-21T04:02:37] casainho: I am using a micro seated scooter with 12 inches wheel only, and If I send the COMM_SET_CURRENT, with a little throttle, I get the motor running at 160kms/h!! very dangerous, as seen on this video I recorded:
[2023-05-21T04:02:38] casainho: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USxNeejr6yk
[2023-05-21T04:03:36] casainho: I think I need the speed control, but also limit the max current
[2023-05-21T04:04:34] casainho: I also happens if I am not on top and by mistake I move a little the throttle, like when I am moving it out of garage to start riding
[2023-05-21T04:04:37] rosheee: ^^' think all stuff mentioned is there
[2023-05-21T04:04:54] rosheee: ?
[2023-05-21T04:05:57] casainho: yes, I am running that motor up to 180 Amps
[2023-05-21T04:07:23] casainho: also, I want speed control for it to work as on my electric cars, where I can drive using only 1 pedal: throttle control the speed, so there is brake regen as soon I reduce a bit the throttle
[2023-05-21T04:07:42] casainho: this code is not yet tested, but I think it will work: case COMM_SET_RPM_CURRENT: { // set target RPM int32_t ind = 0; mc_interface_set_pid_speed((float)buffer_get_int32(data, &ind)); // set max current ind += 4; float max_current = ((float)buffer_get_int32(data, &ind) / 1000.0); mc_configuration *mcconf = mempools_alloc_mcconf(); *mcconf = *mc_interface_get_configuration(); if (mcconf->l_current_max != max_current) { mcconf->l_current_max = max_current; mc_interface_set_configuration(mcconf); } mempools_free_mcconf(mcconf); timeout_reset(); } break;
[2023-05-21T04:08:53] casainho: probably this is solved, if it works, I will make an issue and then a pull request
[2023-05-21T04:09:34] casainho: than you guys
[2023-05-21T04:12:36] casainho: yes, that is my current issue
[2023-05-21T04:12:59] casainho: so, I will set both the speed as also the max current
[2023-05-21T04:14:30] casainho: I think the EMotorcyles throttles work like this... in fact, even the original firmware of the popular Xiaomi M365 stand up scooter
[2023-05-21T04:15:18] casainho: I did the same project with ESP32-S3 with Python firmware + VESC, for Xiaomi M365: https://opensourceebike.github.io/
[2023-05-21T04:18:33] rosheee: Then PID
[2023-05-21T04:18:40] rosheee: Allow brake
[2023-05-21T04:18:59] casainho: No
[2023-05-21T04:19:23] casainho: No, it does not go full speed on the air
[2023-05-21T04:20:01] rosheee: XD not?
[2023-05-21T04:23:52] casainho: I also feel higher torque when I increase the throttle
[2023-05-21T04:24:25] casainho: I really think the throttle control both the speed and max current
[2023-05-21T04:25:00] casainho: Like half of the throttle is half of max motor current
[2023-05-21T04:25:13] casainho: As also half of max wheel speed
[2023-05-21T10:21:06] S1m 0n: <sticker>
[2023-05-21T10:43:33] AK: Very nice, why not micropython?
[2023-05-21T10:44:41] casainho: Because CircuitPython is easier to start with, like the web Editor, for beginners
[2023-05-21T12:47:19] casainho: it works!!
[2023-05-21T12:47:24] casainho: <photos/photo_8416@21-05-2023_12-47-24.jpg>
[2023-05-21T12:47:28] casainho: I just did a few test rides
[2023-05-21T12:48:28] casainho: and I decreased the on VESC tool configurations, the Speed ramp value, to 10x slower
[2023-05-21T12:48:51] Mirono escooters: Very cool
[2023-05-21T13:42:58] casainho: Issue: https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/issues/628

[2023-05-22T12:12:39] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <photos/photo_8417@22-05-2023_12-12-39.jpg>
[2023-05-22T12:12:40] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I have no idea why. Barely pushing it, driving ~30km/h and it overheats. Any other ideas on how to cool motor better? Statorade did not help enough...
[2023-05-22T12:12:57] Mirono escooters: Wtf
[2023-05-22T12:13:15] Mirono escooters: Hubsinks wont fit
[2023-05-22T12:13:19] Mirono escooters: Time to drill holes
[2023-05-22T12:13:24] rosheee: Maybe 2 much
[2023-05-22T12:13:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No, I can't...
[2023-05-22T12:13:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: This is my daily scooter. I can't drill holes into it.
[2023-05-22T12:15:13] rosheee: 2 much ferro?
[2023-05-22T12:15:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No, definitely not. It was the "same" (now little better when no power, so it cools off) without.
[2023-05-22T12:18:32] rosheee: And motor fewls hot AF when touching it?
[2023-05-22T12:18:46] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 50¬∞C now
[2023-05-22T12:18:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: so yes it feels hot to touch
[2023-05-22T12:27:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, need another motor for the PRO2.
[2023-05-22T12:28:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Did not expect it to perform so bad as single motor.
[2023-05-22T12:28:11] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Hope it will perform better in dual for me.
[2023-05-22T12:29:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and for PRO2 I will get standard kV motor 60H or if possible 70H (does that fit into Monorim suspension?)
[2023-05-22T12:32:10] Happy Giraffe: Whats the topspeed on air with the motor? If loaded at min speeds they overheat quickly
[2023-05-22T12:32:43] Happy Giraffe: If you dont face much wind resistance at 80% max speed it can take bit more punishing
[2023-05-22T12:33:04] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I think it was something like 130km/h in air (without field weakening).
[2023-05-22T12:33:47] Happy Giraffe: Oh damn then low rpm is gonna melt it even if it can take a lot of powerü§î
[2023-05-22T12:34:51] Happy Giraffe: https://ebikes.ca/tools/simulator.html
[2023-05-22T12:57:24] rosheee: Phuuu
[2023-05-22T12:57:29] rosheee: When u widen as fuck
[2023-05-22T15:05:15] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Also high kv doesnt effective on slow speed at all, esp when single drive
[2023-05-22T15:59:43] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Please push off with your foot immediately up to 50 kmh at least. Profit
[2023-05-22T17:06:49] Happy Giraffe: Or use light throttle and accept the speed you getüòÅ
[2023-05-22T17:07:32] Mirono escooters: Booring
[2023-05-23T02:55:01] Santiago: Hi guys, is it possible to use OEM pro 2 dashboard with smartesc using camible?? No need to use lisp code??
[2023-05-23T07:43:28] S1m 0n: I think not. Because with smartESC, the controller speaks the Vesc language and no longer Xiaomi. Or the Camible functions are then very limited. Best you ask the guys from the smartESC gruope
[2023-05-23T07:44:30] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Cami useless for vesc imho
[2023-05-23T07:55:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No, it is not possible. Without the Lisp script it will not be able to talk to the display. There is a BLE firmware from camilio which takes the opposite approach by making the display talk to the VESC, but is has few limitations but also a benefit, allowing it to use the ble bluetooth for VESC Tool.
[2023-05-23T07:57:32] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Oof Full complect of firmwares for vesc powered Xiaomi with working vesc BLE app
[2023-05-23T08:53:42] Santiago: May I know the limitations and share the link for the file please??
[2023-05-23T08:54:34] Santiago: So that Camilo ble doesn't use the lisp code then?
[2023-05-23T08:55:40] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No, it doesn't use it, but what's the issue with using the lisp code?
[2023-05-23T08:57:22] Santiago: Kinda messy for me to make it work since I'm not a dev
[2023-05-23T08:57:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It's just pasting it in?
[2023-05-23T09:05:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I don't have the file right now, but it needs to be flashed using ST-LINK V2. It will not feature that much like the Lisp, I think it can only show speed and maybe throttle/brake. I never really tried it myself, but main focus was the bluetooth implementation I guess, which also does not work 100% reliable. I also don't think the display is able to read button actions, because these things are being handled by the ESC which does not work because VESC doesn't know anything about it.
[2023-05-23T09:09:23] Santiago: Didn't lisp code freeze and act weird or that's already solved with the resistor and caps??
[2023-05-23T09:09:38] Santiago: If lisps works fine I'll go for it then
[2023-05-23T09:10:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No it doesn't freeze and act weird, do you mean the button handling?
[2023-05-23T09:10:09] Santiago: Yeah
[2023-05-23T09:11:26] Santiago: The lisp code in the guide is the latest one right??
[2023-05-23T09:11:50] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Resistor helped a bit, but I fixed it by adding a maximum speed for button use, which is not the best fix, but I can't rely on everyone fixing it electronically. Most people don't even add caps or resistors.
[2023-05-23T09:12:21] Santiago: Btw how does wizard work to detect motor parameters since edex told me I can't use without my laptop blowing up
[2023-05-23T09:12:42] Mirono escooters: Wtf is that for bs
[2023-05-23T09:13:14] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: what
[2023-05-23T09:13:28] Santiago: That's why I was asking for the camible because I could run wizard with my phone without issues
[2023-05-23T09:13:46] Mirono escooters: Just run wizard üò≠üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-05-23T09:14:06] Santiago: Edex from scooter hacking group
[2023-05-23T09:14:24] Mirono escooters: Why people with bad opinions so loud
[2023-05-23T09:14:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: You can? Don't you have bluetooth module? Just connect your smartphone to VESC. I don't know what CamiBLE you are talking about, but that won't work.
[2023-05-23T09:18:33] Santiago: I can get a Bluetooth module if it works with smartesc then ??
[2023-05-23T09:19:35] Santiago: Sorry for the stupid questions I just don't know much about this things lol
[2023-05-23T09:19:49] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: You are running SmartESC? So VESC on Xiaomi controller? Yes, connect it to the BMS RX/TX pins and it will work.
[2023-05-23T09:20:50] Santiago: I have stlink so yeah
[2023-05-23T09:24:37] Santiago: Aight, gonna use the makerbase Bluetooth module then
[2023-05-23T09:24:43] Santiago: Thanks guys!!!
[2023-05-23T09:24:54] Santiago: I appreciate your help!
[2023-05-23T12:26:38] Ion: Does this exist for ninebot controller too, or just Xiaomi?
[2023-05-23T12:27:36] Mirono escooters: Yes but it's Buggy
[2023-05-23T12:27:45] Mirono escooters: Sell Ninebot controller, worth ‚Ç¨ Buy 75100

[2023-05-23T12:29:21] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: XD well that's a way
[2023-05-23T14:01:25] Martin Kaktits: im trying to setup tronic250 + vsett motor. It used to work in-air just fine. Then i put a tire on and it decided to cause problems. This vid is it trying to move in hall sensor mode. all halls tested and replaced and i even replaced the whole hall sensor board. No cable cut no short.
[2023-05-23T14:01:25] Martin Kaktits: <video_file>
[2023-05-23T14:01:38] Martin Kaktits: <photos/photo_8420@23-05-2023_14-01-38.jpg>
[2023-05-23T14:01:53] Martin Kaktits: auto detect didnt even detect halls this time at all
[2023-05-23T14:02:00] Martin Kaktits: but messuring manually they work
[2023-05-23T14:02:18] Martin Kaktits: albeit one reads out 0.16v instead of 0v üßê
[2023-05-23T14:03:27] Martin Kaktits: sensoreless mostly works, but is not super smooth at low speed and at exactly 12kmh it shits itself like in this video, then proceeds to worl fine
[2023-05-23T14:04:50] Martin Kaktits: Me and @jamessoderstrom and @roscheeee have been trying to diagnose this shit since yesterday but no real luck.
[2023-05-23T14:05:28] S1m 0n: @PaoloWu is the Motor Master ü´®
[2023-05-23T16:18:51] Martin Kaktits: ok so after some messing around, it seems like the sensoreless BRRRTT happens at exactly the switching point of this filter. I incresse filter erpm and the brrt point moves to higher rpm. So i increased it way beyond and it seems to be smooth at all speeds
[2023-05-23T16:33:25] Finn: What vesc do you have
[2023-05-23T16:35:06] Martin Kaktits: tronic 250
[2023-05-23T16:50:54] Martin Kaktits: ye, i did test run and it pretty muh works. Just no halls :( so <10kmh its little ehh, specially in grass it struggles at low speed. Im vss mode
[2023-05-23T17:37:22] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Smth is not right
[2023-05-23T17:38:06] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Phase filters shouldnt make those jitters
[2023-05-23T17:42:10] Martin Kaktits: i mean, the jitters happen when transitioning from filtered to non-filtered afaik
[2023-05-23T17:42:59] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Disable it
[2023-05-23T17:43:21] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Phase filter is making more accurate motor tuning
[2023-05-23T17:43:24] Martin Kaktits: disabling filter worse
[2023-05-23T17:43:27] Martin Kaktits: doesnt spin up at all
[2023-05-23T17:43:36] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Smth is not right then
[2023-05-23T17:44:39] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I have not any problems with filters or without
[2023-05-23T17:45:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: With filters i get more accurate motor parameters while tuning and a liittle bit of slow speed better because of dead time dist, but its not radical
[2023-05-23T17:45:11] Mirono escooters: It should indeed spin without
[2023-05-23T17:48:08] Martin Kaktits: so wtffff
[2023-05-23T17:49:03] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Not right motor parameters
[2023-05-23T17:49:25] Martin Kaktits: i do auto detect :(
[2023-05-23T17:49:39] Martin Kaktits: + i was suggested to vhange observer
[2023-05-23T17:49:45] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Try manual

[2023-05-23T17:51:01] Martin Kaktits: yes, tjose two things
[2023-05-23T17:51:56] Martin Kaktits: does someone have different tronic firmware perhaps?
[2023-05-23T17:54:33] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Also, check that adc1 throttle and adc2 brakes do not catch large electrical interference when current is pushing
[2023-05-23T17:54:54] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You can look in app tabs and adc mapping
[2023-05-23T17:55:22] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: If pc, then dont forget to turn on app data realtime
[2023-05-23T17:59:07] Martin Kaktits: brrrt happened at low power in air too
[2023-05-23T17:59:20] Martin Kaktits: how can it auto-detect wrong parameters tho?
[2023-05-23T17:59:56] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ofc it can
[2023-05-23T18:00:16] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Try manual detect foc
[2023-05-23T18:00:37] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You are tuning motor until it spins very soft and without any wrong noises

[2023-05-23T18:03:21] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Until the motor spins soft, without jitters, or any hard or light noises, vibrations or else
[2023-05-23T18:07:22] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Also try to look at realtime foc data, and manually change motor parameters in foc tab until the motor will make good and straight current graphs without jitter
[2023-05-23T18:09:12] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: And listen to motor. Need no noises. The only noise are halls (if have them), pwm, and the magnetic field (a little hum)

[2023-05-23T18:15:43] Mihail: My custom vesc appears to be working, will test outside tommorow. PCB is smaller than a debit card (without the caps). 3d printed box is almost done. It is based on 75100 with improvements, so that it doesn't explode that easy. But I can be sure of that after testing üò≥

[2023-05-23T18:18:15] Mihail: Maybe in future, after I do testing
[2023-05-23T18:19:49] Mihail: No idea, transistors are 100v 200A but I wouldn't push it that much, seems dangerous. The plan was to handle 160 phase amps and be able to measure up to 200 amps safely
[2023-05-23T18:21:22] Mirono escooters: Thats perfect
[2023-05-23T18:23:33] Mihail: Main improvements are: -gate drivers with UVLO -Enable pin - added capacitance and filtering, especially on current amplifiers

[2023-05-23T18:54:13] Jan: As i understood, Roger spend hours trying to setup Martins Tronic 250 and everything worked perfectly fine but then Martin just deleted everything (for some reason i suppose?) and started with some weird shenanigans and now it only goes downhill and its at the brink of destroying the vesc? Correct me if im wrong here
[2023-05-23T18:59:10] Mirono escooters: Tried vss and hfi, not succeeding Halls Arent cooperating, dont know why
[2023-05-23T18:59:18] Mirono escooters: Brink of destroying vesc is a bit harsh
[2023-05-23T19:07:30] rosheee: he told me after tire change it started to fail
[2023-05-23T19:59:47] Unknown: Hey guys! I‚Äôve built dozens of electric cars but today I got my first VESC! For now I‚Äôm just throwing one on a spare scooter to learn. I see a lot of people converting ninebots and Xiaomi 365s. Simple question. Is there any chance it‚Äôs as easy as using the 4 wire com that come from the head unit display and uploading some firmware or do I need to cut all that proprietary stuff out and run the brake switch and throttle directly to the Flipsky 75100 pro?
[2023-05-23T20:01:46] Mirono escooters: For Xiaomi display? Yes, 1zuna made a lisp script for it
[2023-05-23T20:10:17] Unknown: So I can leave the throttle, brake, headlight and power button all on the display and only wire the four wires that come down the tube?! Any chance you know where I can find the wiring diagram for that because I‚Äôve been googling and searching the Facebook groups.

[2023-05-23T20:22:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Things may differ with different vesc ,like basically you need a turn on/off for the 75100 original dash not able for that
[2023-05-23T20:24:20] Finn: For that you can use your smartbms if you have one. Or just buy antispark switch from flipsky website
[2023-05-23T20:25:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yes as you say
[2023-05-23T20:28:59] Unknown: That was my other experiment today. My big 500a Daly has soft on but I can‚Äôt find that on my JBD or ANT BMS app and people online say they‚Äôve done it for years but there is a whine if it‚Äôs sat for a couple days. I‚Äôd LOVE to build my motorcycle with no buttons or screen at all but that worries me.

[2023-05-23T20:30:12] Mirono escooters: Crap daly
[2023-05-23T20:31:34] Finn: I turn of and on my bms in my scooter every day. Thats how my scooter worksüòÇ
[2023-05-23T20:32:02] Finn: I dont like daly too but for simple little 3s or 5s batteries its okay and cheap
[2023-05-23T20:32:10] Finn: Nor every batterypack needs smart bms
[2023-05-23T20:33:10] Unknown: What voltage? I don‚Äôt precharge my 24-48v vehicles but we‚Äôve blown several controllers at 72v by skipping the precharge only a few times.
[2023-05-23T20:34:13] Finn: 57,6V and soon i will use it on my 72V also
[2023-05-23T20:34:47] Finn: Yeah you probably need more capacitors in parralel
[2023-05-23T20:35:23] Finn: What controller you blew?

[2023-05-23T20:36:30] Unknown: I have a pile. lol
[2023-05-23T20:37:43] Unknown: I think I‚Äôll risk it. At least these VESC are easy to swap out!
[2023-05-23T20:38:11] Mirono escooters: 800A??
[2023-05-23T20:38:23] Finn: Scooter goes brr with 800AüòÇüòÇ

[2023-05-23T20:40:04] Mirono escooters: We need more info and photos
[2023-05-23T20:40:17] Mirono escooters: Is this univ?
[2023-05-23T20:40:37] Unknown: I teach kids in the hood how to build and race electric 3 wheeled cars. lol‚Ä¶ and scooters for fun
[2023-05-23T20:40:44] Mirono escooters: Legend
[2023-05-23T20:41:05] Mirono escooters: You from where? That is some metal cost/ material, who pay if I may ask

[2023-05-23T20:41:20] Mirono escooters: I love those things, but my wallet refuses me to spend casual hundreds on metal
[2023-05-23T20:41:33] Mirono escooters: Murrika is my guess

[2023-05-23T20:46:04] Unknown: Have any of you done the lisp code to communicate to an existing scooter display like the link @Her0DasH sent?
[2023-05-23T20:46:39] Mirono escooters: @kawaiinekololis is creator
[2023-05-23T20:46:47] Unknown: That looks pretty complicated.
[2023-05-23T20:47:33] Mirono escooters: Its pretty okay

[2023-05-23T20:48:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Surly, we made more than with that
[2023-05-23T20:48:27] Mirono escooters: Airport??
[2023-05-23T20:48:36] Mirono escooters: XD, I love Americas variety for such things
[2023-05-23T20:48:46] Mirono escooters: Try that in BE and you are problably locked for being dangerous
[2023-05-23T20:48:59] Finn: The cool thing about that stuff is you can drive it on the roadüòÇ
[2023-05-23T20:49:29] Mirono escooters: Merika is really chill, I see vids of guys riding 80 with stealth bomber bikes, and police just waving
[2023-05-23T20:50:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Depends on where and what you doü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-05-23T20:50:24] Mirono escooters: Yes, ofcourse
[2023-05-23T20:50:27] Mirono escooters: But I talk country side
[2023-05-23T20:50:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Probably can tell more if you teach hood kids
[2023-05-23T20:50:42] Mirono escooters: So cool he does that
[2023-05-23T20:50:47] Mirono escooters: Those kids must love him
[2023-05-23T20:51:10] Unknown: I recorded this last Saturday.
[2023-05-23T20:51:31] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-05-23T20:51:45] Mirono escooters: I wanna ride in between with bomber, omg
[2023-05-23T20:51:47] Mirono escooters: No one would care
[2023-05-23T20:52:25] Unknown: There were several bombers, Onyx, venoms etc.
[2023-05-23T20:53:17] Mirono escooters: Here 0
[2023-05-23T20:53:19] Mirono escooters: I'm lone wolf
[2023-05-23T20:53:24] Mirono escooters: Not good when police with a speedy car
[2023-05-23T20:54:26] Unknown: Ok. I‚Äôm just having a hard time finding the wiring diagram from the display to the Flipsky.
[2023-05-23T20:57:16] Unknown: They aren‚Äôt allowed to chase us and at least 30% of us have our guns on us so the cops just let us do our thing. That cop was actually just blocking traffic for us. In my city the cops really don‚Äôt care. I can drive those electric race cars on the street with no plates, insurance or anything and It‚Äôs legal.
[2023-05-23T20:59:21] Mirono escooters: Wait, aren't allowed?
[2023-05-23T20:59:52] Mirono escooters: I also thought my city was ok, but after 2 years I hit the lamp, going 80 at night. 0 cars, no one to bother But they still chased me
[2023-05-23T21:01:21] Unknown: Ok. I may need to make an account. Or Google translate is blocking it. I‚Äôll keep working on it.
[2023-05-23T21:03:44] Unknown: Ya if they flip on their lights and you make it apparent you are going to run they have to stop chasing you. So hardly anyone even registers their bikes or puts plates on. Most people still have insurance in case they wreck but if you don‚Äôt have a plate they can‚Äôt mail you a ticket.
[2023-05-23T21:04:15] Unknown: Why Im getting such a error with those settings? :o
[2023-05-23T21:04:16] Unknown: <photos/photo_8437@23-05-2023_21-04-16.jpg>
[2023-05-23T21:04:31] Mirono escooters: What? That rule is weird?
[2023-05-23T21:04:45] Mirono escooters: Up abs overcurrent

[2023-05-23T21:05:04] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes sadly you will need to create an account. Sorry for that, it's the forum, nothing I can do about.
[2023-05-23T21:05:24] Unknown: How Can i get rid of it?
[2023-05-23T21:05:36] Mirono escooters: Up your settings
[2023-05-23T21:05:38] Mirono escooters: Abs overcurrent
[2023-05-23T21:07:38] Unknown: 105A from battery. Original
[2023-05-23T21:10:04] Unknown: I have ios latest vesc tool. But i think version is 6.3(?) that one which came with vesc. Should i update it to?

[2023-05-23T21:26:14] Unknown: I got it! Thank you. What is spannungsglattung? It translates to stress smoothing?
[2023-05-23T21:26:27] Unknown: <photos/photo_8440@23-05-2023_21-26-27.jpg>
[2023-05-23T21:27:34] Mirono escooters: Lol, that translated pretty well
[2023-05-23T21:30:47] Unknown: lol. There‚Äôs a lot about this I‚Äôm stressed about but I‚Äôm not sure what adding resistors and capacitors to the low voltage is going to do? I also don‚Äôt have any 10v capacitors lying around so I hope it‚Äôll be fine without them.
[2023-05-23T21:31:22] Mirono escooters: Filtering
[2023-05-23T21:31:32] Mirono escooters: U risk random button presses and noise
[2023-05-23T21:33:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Not VESC related tho, but ... Me training ChatGPT for BB to Markdown conversion, so I can post the guide on GitHub. The time I wasted on this is more than I could have used translating it myself XD Anyway does not work cuz text too big, only works with parts of it. Now waiting for friend to try it on gpt4. Edit: making it write a tool that does it works ... better
[2023-05-23T21:33:32] Unknown: Ah yea. Thanks üòÑüòÖ
[2023-05-23T22:11:22] AK: Capacitor is unneeded
[2023-05-23T22:11:26] AK: This is just cargocult
[2023-05-23T22:11:47] AK: It's filtered on both sides already, with proper values
[2023-05-23T22:12:32] AK: Pullup is needed, but 470 ohm is obviously way too low, causing unneded drain, go with 1-3k, whatever
[2023-05-23T22:13:09] AK: The only thing worse is paolo team with 3984657389054608793 farad capacitors on xiaomi escs
[2023-05-23T22:13:31] Mirono escooters: Photo?
[2023-05-23T22:13:49] Unknown: Can I just wire it with 4 wires directly without using the 3.3v at all?
[2023-05-23T22:13:56] Mirono escooters: Ohh right, where they had 8000uf of big caps in frame
[2023-05-23T22:14:23] AK: No, you need the pullup
[2023-05-23T22:14:24] Unknown: <photos/photo_8442@23-05-2023_22-14-24.jpg>
[2023-05-23T22:14:39] AK: you can just do it inside the connector
[2023-05-23T22:14:50] Unknown: <photos/photo_8443@23-05-2023_22-14-50.jpg>
[2023-05-23T22:15:13] AK: Just any photo of any mods in the m365 channel, It does not go fasta from more capacitors
[2023-05-23T22:15:30] Mirono escooters: How u did hide thing
[2023-05-23T22:15:45] Mirono escooters: I know this and this

[2023-05-23T22:18:15] Unknown: Where would I put the resistor if I don‚Äôt use the 3.3v pin?
[2023-05-23T22:19:38] AK: In my opinion and in the opinion of other people yes, but obviously in some other peoples opinions it is
[2023-05-23T22:19:42] AK: So you decide
[2023-05-23T22:19:54] AK: Yes
[2023-05-23T22:23:09] Unknown: Ok thank you! That‚Äôs very helpful to know and I‚Äôll definitely do that in the future. This scooter I‚Äôm just building to play with for a week to learn the software then it‚Äôll probably get thrown away so I‚Äôm not too worried about button presses as long as it‚Äôs functions. If the VESC work good we‚Äôll get a bunch of 300-500amp ones for our actual builds.
[2023-05-23T22:23:32] AK: On the g30 I layed separate lines for throttle and brake, since I don't trust lisp on that stuff
[2023-05-23T22:23:48] AK: You should have crimp tools, no?
[2023-05-23T22:24:10] Mirono escooters: How come
[2023-05-23T22:24:16] Unknown: Ya. What for?
[2023-05-23T22:24:28] AK: Just add a resistor on the connector, connecting corresponding pins, 3 minute work
[2023-05-23T22:25:31] AK: Well, why would I want to process brake and throttle via two additional processing steps, if I have direct adc input?
[2023-05-23T22:25:38] AK: To save a wire?
[2023-05-23T22:26:05] AK: I am poor the last couple of years, but 1 extra wire I can afford üòÇ
[2023-05-23T22:28:31] AK: Well, have fun guys, I am off sleeping, don't stay up too late üòò
[2023-05-23T22:28:45] Unknown: Ok so a 1k resistor from gnd and rx both to 3.3v?
[2023-05-23T22:28:48] Mirono escooters: Slepwell baby
[2023-05-23T22:29:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 1K resistor from 3.3V to RX
[2023-05-23T22:38:39] Unknown: Another weird question. A guy told me to lock his bike using the esc he would just switch it to a program with 0amp output. I had a thought, if you did that could you also wire up an alarm so that if the throttle was pressed while the in that program it would alert you?

[2023-05-24T12:06:56] Unknown: ‚Ç¨ 259,48 41%di SCONTO | Flipsky Dual 75100 con PCB in alluminio basato su esc per Skateboard elettrico/Scooter/Ebike Speed Controller https://a.aliexpress.com/_EQmm75F
[2023-05-24T12:23:50] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No, 259‚Ç¨ is not a good deal and dual ESCs I cannot recommend. If one fails, it's really bad.
[2023-05-24T12:24:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Rather get two of Makerbase or Flipsky 75100 Alu PCB, they are the same like you sent, but only cost 95‚Ç¨ each and can be connected together. https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DE9TKAl
[2023-05-24T12:26:39] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: The only difference is the extra cost and that these ESCs are put into one case, which limits your flexibility when it comes to placing it into your scooter and bike. :)
[2023-05-24T12:29:33] Unknown: thank you so much kind

[2023-05-24T15:23:09] Mirono escooters: Without halls it'll always stutter at low speeds
[2023-05-24T15:23:15] Jhonn Carl Lopez: How can i fix it
[2023-05-24T15:23:19] Mirono escooters: Or you have to set up vss or hfi

[2023-05-24T15:24:16] Mirono escooters: Up abs max overcurrent
[2023-05-24T15:24:17] Jhonn Carl Lopez: Ill get this data
[2023-05-24T15:25:40] Jhonn Carl Lopez: Ive set my battery max current to 250a i might able to push the throttle further but i think i moght damage the esc that why im asking for help
[2023-05-24T15:26:06] Jhonn Carl Lopez: I seen tutorial just set there max current to 120a
[2023-05-24T15:26:12] Jhonn Carl Lopez: On escooter
[2023-05-24T15:26:15] Mirono escooters: Batt 250??
[2023-05-24T15:26:20] Jhonn Carl Lopez: Yes
[2023-05-24T15:26:33] Mirono escooters: Is your battery a beast?
[2023-05-24T15:26:38] Jhonn Carl Lopez: But i didnt push to hard
[2023-05-24T15:26:47] Mirono escooters: I'm pretty sure batt is sagging like titties
[2023-05-24T15:26:57] Jhonn Carl Lopez: Yeah i know
[2023-05-24T15:27:06] Jhonn Carl Lopez: Im just wondering on the settings
[2023-05-24T15:27:19] Jhonn Carl Lopez: Ive turn the off
[2023-05-24T15:27:21] Jhonn Carl Lopez: That
[2023-05-24T15:28:00] Jhonn Carl Lopez: Just LG32
[2023-05-24T15:28:10] Jhonn Carl Lopez: I think that the stock
[2023-05-24T15:28:33] Jhonn Carl Lopez: Ill do i quick test right now
[2023-05-24T15:45:31] Jhonn Carl Lopez: <photos/photo_8456@24-05-2023_15-45-31.jpg>
[2023-05-24T15:45:35] Jhonn Carl Lopez: I got this
[2023-05-24T15:46:23] Jhonn Carl Lopez: <photos/photo_8457@24-05-2023_15-46-23.jpg>
[2023-05-24T15:46:27] Jhonn Carl Lopez: And this
[2023-05-24T15:50:24] Jhonn Carl Lopez: What do i need to do?
[2023-05-24T15:50:51] Jhonn Carl Lopez: Do i need to change something on the vesc or i need to upgrade my battery
[2023-05-24T16:03:40] Jhonn Carl Lopez: Got this thank you!
[2023-05-24T16:06:19] Jhonn Carl Lopez: Last question. My wheel is 90/6.5 how do a get an accurate speedometer?
[2023-05-24T16:06:32] Jhonn Carl Lopez: Thank you so much!
[2023-05-24T16:06:56] Jhonn Carl Lopez: A stock 11in city cst tires
[2023-05-24T16:07:35] Jhonn Carl Lopez: Mine was set at 14poles no wonder why i cant get accurate speedometer
[2023-05-24T16:13:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 100v100a single ubox will be on fire very quick. Good it has protections
[2023-05-24T16:13:29] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Wtf
[2023-05-24T16:14:15] Konstantin: Hm..75200..new fets...
[2023-05-24T16:14:57] Konstantin: And no capacitors...
[2023-05-24T16:14:57] Konstantin: <photos/photo_8459@24-05-2023_16-14-57.jpg>
[2023-05-24T16:17:22] Konstantin: Old was
[2023-05-24T16:17:32] Konstantin: <photos/photo_8460@24-05-2023_16-17-32.jpg>
[2023-05-24T16:20:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: Flipsky or maker base
[2023-05-24T16:21:40] Konstantin: Flipsky
[2023-05-24T16:39:07] Mirono escooters: No??
[2023-05-24T16:43:33] Mihail: Went for a 15km ride with 10s battery at 25 amps, no issues. It passed basic testing so I can continue with bigger battery.Heat was a bit high at 50-60c, as it has no cooling attached yet. I am still afraid to connect original Vsett 10 battery, it has no bms and will destroy the pcb if anything goes wrong. Next step is to test with 14s 50A battery.
[2023-05-24T16:44:08] Mirono escooters: Oh no BMS?
[2023-05-24T16:45:20] Mihail: Yes, it has a bms for balancing but outputs are not protected. Only 50A fuse which Ive never seen burning, usually destroys mosfet violently and causes pcb damage
[2023-05-24T16:46:30] Mirono escooters: I'm preeety sure stock vsett batt has discharge mosfets
[2023-05-24T16:46:34] Mirono escooters: Or he modified it
[2023-05-24T16:47:07] Mihail: I have not modified it, no output protection exept for useless fuse
[2023-05-24T16:48:15] Mihail: I have not opened it to check, but seeing the absolute damage it does to controllers I am pretty sure it has no protection at all.
[2023-05-24T16:48:45] Mirono escooters: It has..
[2023-05-24T16:49:11] Mirono escooters: But its problably very high and trip late, as usual Daly has discharge MOSFETs but no overcurrent protection Problably same here
[2023-05-24T16:49:23] Mihail: The 14s battery I made for my xiaomi is set to 60A and does no damage to traces, vsett battery literally explodes the mosfets.
[2023-05-24T16:50:22] Mihail: Possible, the advertising says it has temperature protection, maybe they've set it to react too slow
[2023-05-24T16:51:15] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-05-24T16:51:21] Mirono escooters: Own build quality versus.. well..
[2023-05-24T16:52:20] Mihail: Ninebot and lime batteries also cause no damage when shorted
[2023-05-24T16:53:02] Mihail: Sad that ninebot has no scooter similar to vsett 10
[2023-05-24T16:53:02] Mirono escooters: Build well
[2023-05-24T16:53:11] Mirono escooters: Ninebot gt2?..
[2023-05-24T16:53:19] Mirono escooters: Better in Evert way
[2023-05-24T16:53:20] Mihail: Its too heavy
[2023-05-24T16:53:33] Mihail: More like vsett 11+ replacement
[2023-05-24T16:53:47] Mirono escooters: And the smaller versions of it?
[2023-05-24T16:54:09] Mihail: Gt1 was single motor I believe.
[2023-05-24T16:54:20] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-05-24T16:54:23] Mirono escooters: Mod dual :-p
[2023-05-24T16:56:17] Mirono escooters: Or is that because it sags enough? :)
[2023-05-24T16:57:10] Mihail: I used it at 100A, never tripped
[2023-05-24T16:57:19] Mihail: 2x50A on the controllers
[2023-05-24T16:57:49] Mihail: Even tried 55A on each
[2023-05-24T16:58:53] Mihail: Maybe, I got the scooter second hand with burned controller,
[2023-05-24T17:20:10] Ion: Is it worth it at all to try more than 75A on stock battery (with fuses)? Even if it doesn't shut off at 80+, it will probably sag a lot, right?
[2023-05-24T17:20:33] Ion: Just out of interest, how much did you pay for it ?
[2023-05-24T17:22:54] Mihail: Not calculated yet, as I bought other stuff. Roughly around 60euro
[2023-05-24T17:23:09] Mirono escooters: Thats cheap
[2023-05-24T17:23:31] Mihail: I have parts for 5, 3 for me and 2 for a friend
[2023-05-24T17:23:52] Ion: 60‚Ç¨ for a Vsett 10+ üò≥
[2023-05-24T17:24:30] Mihail: Oh no I though you asked about the controller. Vsett was 750euro
[2023-05-24T17:24:45] Ion: You're right. Maybe in the future lol It's enough for now still
[2023-05-24T17:25:28] Ion: Well that makes a lot more sense. Still a great deal i think
[2023-05-24T17:27:28] Mihail: Yeah, it had some issues as it was used 7500km by a food delivery person, but overall im happy. It also came with 2 external flashlights, foldable lock, phone holder, fixed handlebars and the foldable originals, 2 chargers and spare tyre and tubes
[2023-05-24T17:27:58] Mirono escooters: Controller is so cheap? Wow
[2023-05-24T17:30:03] Mihail: Well that is parts, no labor. The process of assembling is quite time consuming. I should've ordered a stencil, but decided to "save" 7 dollars. Bad decision :D
[2023-05-24T17:30:11] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-05-24T17:30:16] Mirono escooters: Jlcpcb can't assemble?
[2023-05-24T17:30:21] Mirono escooters: I don't value my time, I like building
[2023-05-24T17:30:33] Mirono escooters: So cheaper then a 75100 for better, heck ye
[2023-05-24T17:30:45] Mirono escooters: Mp2 is 110‚Ç¨? But aalooot off assembly work, but crazy specs
[2023-05-24T17:31:42] Mihail: They can but the cheap option is a very limited catalog of parts. Extended parts are +$3 fee per component type for setting up the pick and place machine
[2023-05-24T17:32:37] Mihail: There is such machine at work, but I would have to buy a panels at least for 50 controllers to be worth the hassle
[2023-05-24T17:32:57] Mirono escooters: U from where?
[2023-05-24T17:33:01] Mirono escooters: Europa can find much ppl
[2023-05-24T17:33:04] Mihail: Bulgaria
[2023-05-24T17:36:11] Mihail: The majority of components are 0402 package and require microscope to be hand soldered. And they are many, as I made filtering a priority. There is a big pi filter on each of the current amplifiers and before the 3.3v regulator
[2023-05-24T17:36:36] Mirono escooters: We could do a europa order
[2023-05-24T17:36:37] Mirono escooters: I'd take 2
[2023-05-24T17:37:12] Mihail: Is this some kind of company?
[2023-05-24T17:37:40] Mirono escooters: No, we have done before a group order for vescs
[2023-05-24T17:37:42] Mirono escooters: Saved costs and stuff
[2023-05-24T17:37:47] Mirono escooters: Last time was for mp2 vesc
[2023-05-24T17:39:22] Mihail: Order from where, some assembly company? Or do you mean just collecting 50 orders so that it is feasable for me to make it myself?
[2023-05-24T17:42:13] Mirono escooters: Assembly company would be cool
[2023-05-24T17:42:19] Mirono escooters: Or you and earn some bucks on it
[2023-05-24T17:42:31] Mirono escooters: Europa made quality vescs > little bit cheaper shitsky
[2023-05-24T17:46:49] Mihail: Thing is the cables and capacitors are very hard to solder as it is an aluminum pcb. Heat sinking is massive, that is fantastic for cooling, not so much for assembling. I have no idea if external fab house can do that. Also I have no idea where to source busbars, plastic housing and other cosmetic stuff
[2023-05-24T17:47:58] Mirono escooters: Fair
[2023-05-24T17:50:49] Mihail: Currently the housing is 3d printed with pla, Ive set temperature range to 50-70c to avoid melting the plastic.
[2023-05-24T17:55:00] Mihail: Does anyone care or use usb on their vesc? I haven't used it since I got bluetooth. It is on the pcb, but hidden inside the case, as I never use it. The vesc firmware works on gd32f405 microcontroller, without the usb.
[2023-05-24T17:55:05] Jan: Too high, Tg of PLA is about 40-50¬∞C
[2023-05-24T17:55:32] Jan: It will not melt until 170¬∞C+ but after 40¬∞C it will become so soft that it deforms
[2023-05-24T18:01:05] Mihail: Also for anyone interested in bluetooth, there is a very cheap alternative to the prebuilt VESC Bluetooth modules. This module is less than 2 euro and can be flashed with stlink to be used on vesc
[2023-05-24T18:02:25] Mihail: I don't know if everyone is aware of this, I've seen very overpriced modules online. Like 10x overpriced
[2023-05-24T18:03:38] Mirono escooters: Got the fw?
[2023-05-24T18:03:54] Mirono escooters: Bluetooth ftw
[2023-05-24T18:04:49] Mihail: It was in vesc project I think, Ill check
[2023-05-24T18:06:11] Mihail: It is in vedderb/nrf51_vesc repo in github
[2023-05-24T18:07:10] Mihail: Mr Vedder also wrote instructions how to do it.
[2023-05-24T19:07:52] Konstantin: Not only module like this, and similar to xD. I make it from random trash, even from m365 head, ninebot...xD
[2023-05-24T19:08:18] AK: You can also use an esp32
[2023-05-24T19:09:00] Konstantin: Y.. Vesc loger...and use psw xD
[2023-05-24T19:09:03] Mihail: Im happy people are aware of this and not overpaying
[2023-05-24T19:09:52] Konstantin: Vesc express
[2023-05-24T19:09:59] Mihail: Has anyone gotten the metr.at app to work with a generic module? Seems like a great app but requires their hardware
[2023-05-24T19:10:35] Konstantin: Esp32+external gps module... Can log , and search, when esc brrrrr;)
[2023-05-24T19:11:13] Konstantin: Good gps cost 15-25$... + Esp... + other...
[2023-05-24T19:19:24] Uzzo Ô£ø: Hi everyone‚úåüèº
[2023-05-24T19:21:18] Mihail: Hi
[2023-05-24T19:24:14] S1m 0n: Rui
[2023-05-24T23:20:46] Martin Kaktits: does anything in the "sensoreless" tab matter when.running vss mode?
[2023-05-24T23:24:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: These are used chip , no good quality
[2023-05-24T23:25:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: Sometimes Bluetooth random turn off , disconnect or not work
[2023-05-24T23:50:31] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, in each menu of the algorithm there are ERPM parameters for switching to sensorless mode. After entering the sensorless mode, all parameters in this tab (sensorless) begin to be active
[2023-05-24T23:52:17] Martin Kaktits: VSS switch to sensoreless tho? I only see openloop erpm in vss tab, nothign about switching to something else
[2023-05-24T23:54:29] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: ah, then no. i have never use vss
[2023-05-24T23:55:12] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Edited*
[2023-05-24T23:55:33] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: hfi is better
[2023-05-24T23:55:54] Martin Kaktits: how to setup tho üò≠üò¨

[2023-05-25T01:55:45] rosheee: omg u never believe me XD
[2023-05-25T02:19:59] rosheee: easy ^^' u never read what i write
[2023-05-25T02:21:23] Martin Kaktits: i read but i mostly dont understand what you say üò¨
[2023-05-25T03:47:13] rosheee: <sticker>
[2023-05-25T05:39:26] Mihail: I've had that issue. Adding a capacitor solved it
[2023-05-25T08:13:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes. I am aware of this and also got one at home, but the other models are a little bit smaller.
[2023-05-25T08:32:13] Mirono escooters: No caps is deprimating
[2023-05-25T11:20:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Hi y'all Any of you familar with Niu software?
[2023-05-25T13:13:30] Unknown: Heey! Im getting this error when accelerating fast. There is limit at absolute current max to 180a. Should i just lower my motor max current? Or limitless? Does my ubox single 80 handle over 180a?
[2023-05-25T13:13:31] Unknown: <photos/photo_8467@25-05-2023_13-13-31.jpg>
[2023-05-25T15:28:12] Unknown: 100A. When accelerating fast. At low speeds. Yeaa lowering it will solve it for sure. But is isnt there somekind of limitless firmware? Should i try it or do i just destroy my vesc
[2023-05-25T16:38:52] Unknown: 120A motor 100A battery
[2023-05-25T17:03:55] Yosi Moreno: How can i get a better acceleration on my flipsky 75200? Custom battery 22.5a 60v 8c, zero 10x original hub motor 1000w. I set the battery max current to 90a, max motor current to 120, absolute current to 130. And i didn't change the motor fase wires yet... Top speed is very good 70/74 kph. Also the acceleration after 15/20 kph is very good. Only 0 to 20 kph is not so good. Sensorless.
[2023-05-25T17:04:41] Mirono escooters: More phase amps
[2023-05-25T17:05:45] Yosi Moreno: What's the right amount to draw?
[2023-05-25T17:06:24] Mirono escooters: 180 is nice
[2023-05-25T17:06:31] Mirono escooters: Depends on your motor what it takes
[2023-05-25T17:10:12] Yosi Moreno: Interesting ü§î don't you think the motor will burn very fast at 180a?
[2023-05-25T17:10:28] Mirono escooters: Its only at low speed
[2023-05-25T17:10:34] Mirono escooters: Phase /motor amps
[2023-05-25T17:10:54] Yosi Moreno: I mean the vesc test recommend 84a
[2023-05-25T17:11:41] Mirono escooters: Continuous yes
[2023-05-25T17:11:54] Mirono escooters: Play with observers and phase amps
[2023-05-25T17:12:30] Yosi Moreno: Will try üëç thank you
[2023-05-25T17:29:24] Yosi Moreno: Singel motor . I think i burned the hallsensor. I know i should put a temp sensor init, and replace the hallsensor.. but for now it is what it is...
[2023-05-25T17:38:58] Yosi Moreno: For sure it didn't happen from heat
[2023-05-25T17:40:50] Yosi Moreno: After 1 min of riding
[2023-05-25T17:53:31] Happy Giraffe: Pls noüòÖ
[2023-05-25T17:53:50] Happy Giraffe: Atleast xiaomi bms should limit output to 20A anyways without data cable
[2023-05-25T17:59:53] Happy Giraffe: I have wondered if I should use temp compensation or notü§î some settings just arent turn "on" and it will work lol
[2023-05-25T20:13:19] Unknown: Ya mine is a clone and No matter what said e3 error. I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs colors weren‚Äôt right.
[2023-05-25T20:21:05] Unknown: Onto a new a new build today!!
[2023-05-25T20:21:06] Unknown: <photos/photo_8469@25-05-2023_20-21-06.jpg>
[2023-05-25T20:26:46] Unknown: I‚Äôm only planning on wiring up the 2 wire rear brake for regen, throttle and the key which I will only use 2 wires from (because the voltage display will be useless.) So will the brake only be 3.3v and adc2 (no ground) Where do the two key wires go? TX and RX? I will not have a screen. I have Bluetooth and my phone but this is the only wiring diagram I can find.
[2023-05-25T20:27:00] Unknown: <photos/photo_8470@25-05-2023_20-27-00.jpg>
[2023-05-25T20:34:43] Unknown: Dang‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs what I was afraid of. Ok so‚Ä¶ put the key inline with the throttle power? lol
[2023-05-25T20:35:36] Mirono escooters: That works
[2023-05-25T20:35:51] Mirono escooters: Except if noise on throttle line..
[2023-05-25T20:36:57] Unknown: How much power does the flipsky use sitting idle? Would the bike die if left for a couple weeks?
[2023-05-25T20:37:16] Mirono escooters: Few ma
[2023-05-25T20:37:19] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-05-25T20:38:21] Unknown: Ok cool. I‚Äôm going to wire it all up and give you guys an update later hopefully!
[2023-05-25T20:40:07] Unknown: Oh ya but the all or nothing brake switch would just not have a ground correct? Or would it be adc2 and ground wires?
[2023-05-25T20:43:55] AK: ofc not
[2023-05-25T20:45:03] Mirono escooters: ?

[2023-05-25T20:45:36] Mirono escooters: Wtf?
[2023-05-25T20:45:50] Mirono escooters: Last time I checked with my Psu, it was so little
[2023-05-25T20:45:55] Mirono escooters: Must depends on vesc to vesc
[2023-05-25T21:19:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yes if you forget to use there button wayüòÅ
[2023-05-25T21:23:49] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: same it was like 16mA on 75100 Alu
[2023-05-25T21:24:27] Mirono escooters: 1W
[2023-05-25T21:24:30] Mirono escooters: At 72v
[2023-05-25T21:26:44] AK: That's literally 2 watts at 16s
[2023-05-25T21:27:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: ^
[2023-05-25T21:27:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: ???
[2023-05-25T21:27:41] AK: Few ma is not 16 - 20mA
[2023-05-25T21:27:49] AK: .
[2023-05-25T21:27:52] Mirono escooters: üò≠
[2023-05-25T21:28:04] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: meh that's a few mA for me
[2023-05-25T21:28:26] Mirono escooters: Its literally a led of 5
[2023-05-25T21:29:35] AK: I have no problem with someone saying, "2w standby is not much for me", but it's not the same as saying couple of ma, tbh
[2023-05-25T21:29:46] AK: Just bringing out the real numbers
[2023-05-25T21:30:07] AK: Kinda like 50 kmh is fast and 100kmh is both fast for 10 inch wheels

[2023-05-25T21:57:40] Mirono escooters: And can't seem to get the top board off
[2023-05-25T22:29:49] Alex: Hi guys! I have some temperature problems when i go uphill. Is there any settings what i need to change?
[2023-05-25T22:30:11] Alex: Ubox v2 100v 100a
[2023-05-25T22:30:31] Alex: Sorry guys motor temperature

[2023-05-25T23:09:02] rosheee: suc√© temps
[2023-05-25T23:10:34] Alex: Thats a good question its a zero 11x motor tuned up
[2023-05-25T23:12:00] Jan: Same reason trucks got bigger engines üò¨

[2023-05-25T23:12:57] Alex: The cooling is ok
[2023-05-25T23:12:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: 11x is 60h
[2023-05-25T23:16:43] Alex: I push itüòã
[2023-05-25T23:17:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: Similar, but same brand, it should be 65mm but I‚Äôm not sure
[2023-05-25T23:17:20] Alex: <photos/photo_8477@25-05-2023_23-17-20.jpg>
[2023-05-25T23:17:26] Alex: Default
[2023-05-25T23:19:56] Alex: So make it higher? Cause now the esc temperature is much better
[2023-05-25T23:20:21] Alex: When i make it 35 it will make cooler my motors and heats up more the esc?
[2023-05-25T23:22:06] Alex: <photos/photo_8478@25-05-2023_23-22-06.jpg>
[2023-05-25T23:22:17] Alex: I took these back to the default
[2023-05-25T23:22:33] Alex: Cause last time the problem was the hall sensors
[2023-05-25T23:23:07] Alex: <photos/photo_8479@25-05-2023_23-23-07.jpg>
[2023-05-25T23:23:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: No lol, it affect only in current discharge , it would heat against more
[2023-05-25T23:23:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: You don‚Äôt get magic power more from changing observer
[2023-05-25T23:24:38] rosheee: i used crap cooling on kaabo with 100V ubox and 2x tronic in stock ESC box ^^' and had better temps
[2023-05-25T23:24:53] Alex: It can be a problem that i take in bigger suspensions in my 11x?
[2023-05-25T23:25:04] Alex: These are 2 cm longer than the stock
[2023-05-25T23:25:28] Jan: The challenge is fastest 0-100 km/h not 0-100 ¬∞C
[2023-05-25T23:25:48] Mirono escooters: Good one

[2023-05-25T23:28:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: Amazing
[2023-05-25T23:28:19] rosheee: i did this for airflow inside esc box besides radiator
[2023-05-25T23:28:19] rosheee: <video_file>
[2023-05-25T23:29:02] Alex: Its a good idea
[2023-05-25T23:29:20] Alex: But my motors doesnt like the uphills
[2023-05-25T23:29:31] Alex: And it heats up too quickly
[2023-05-25T23:29:40] rosheee: yes wtf
[2023-05-25T23:29:51] rosheee: ferrofluid helps just a bit ^^' what amps u pushing?
[2023-05-25T23:29:54] rosheee: battery n shizzl
[2023-05-25T23:30:04] rosheee: dis hyper heateria

[2023-05-25T23:31:42] Alex: E brake
[2023-05-25T23:31:44] rosheee: 80A battery regen xD?
[2023-05-25T23:31:51] rosheee: dis not 2 high? or u have fuckeria battery?
[2023-05-25T23:31:53] rosheee: if each 80A
[2023-05-25T23:32:01] rosheee: then full brake and send 160A back 2 battery
[2023-05-25T23:32:20] rosheee: how high is zero vector frequency?
[2023-05-25T23:32:22] Alex: I use it like an adjustable ebrake on an other throttle
[2023-05-25T23:32:32] Alex: I have 40t battery
[2023-05-25T23:32:36] Alex: 30

[2023-05-25T23:33:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: But logic board dead
[2023-05-25T23:33:21] rosheee: ok hmm if u put on sample v0 v7 esc gets hotter
[2023-05-25T23:33:24] rosheee: but maybe motors bit cooler
[2023-05-25T23:33:49] rosheee: tire pressure also ok and not 2 low?

[2023-05-25T23:35:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: 2x xt60, better than single xt90
[2023-05-25T23:35:52] rosheee: 1x xt60 per esc
[2023-05-25T23:35:54] Alex: <video_file>
[2023-05-25T23:36:01] Alex: Xt90
[2023-05-25T23:36:10] Alex: Awg 12

[2023-05-25T23:36:35] rosheee: awg12 phuuu
[2023-05-25T23:37:00] Alex: But gotta buy an other fuse
[2023-05-25T23:37:12] Alex: Cause i dont want to connect it without fuse
[2023-05-25T23:37:20] Alex: Not enough?
[2023-05-25T23:37:28] Alex: My battery has any problems
[2023-05-25T23:37:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: If bms works well, fuse isn‚Äôt needed
[2023-05-25T23:38:06] Alex: It works well but my first vesc killed a bms
[2023-05-25T23:38:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: Lol, normally bms kill vesc
[2023-05-25T23:38:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs very stranger
[2023-05-25T23:38:29] Finn: @PaoloWu dont you have any problems with dust particles going to damage your motor?
[2023-05-25T23:38:36] Alex: When i connect it on the other xt90 too it will good?

[2023-05-25T23:39:22] rosheee: i think this awg12 or 10 idk but only 16S5P with 50G sells ^^' 60A bms cable went h0t
[2023-05-25T23:39:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: I clean it with compressor after every ride
[2023-05-25T23:40:21] Finn: And what temps are you getting? And what motor is it even
[2023-05-25T23:40:28] Alex: I dont have it at home
[2023-05-25T23:40:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Blade already sold

[2023-05-25T23:41:44] Finn: Oh
[2023-05-25T23:41:44] Alex: Sorry for the music some numbers from the bms
[2023-05-25T23:42:04] Finn: I only draw 100A battery with awg10üòÇ
[2023-05-25T23:42:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: No possible with 12awg
[2023-05-25T23:42:13] Finn: Should be enough
[2023-05-25T23:42:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: My 8awg warm with 150A , so I don‚Äôt know how possible with 12awg
[2023-05-25T23:43:21] rosheee: yas

[2023-05-25T23:45:06] rosheee: XD using this for 16S crap battery now ahah
[2023-05-25T23:50:16] Alex: The speed is not correct cause here the wheel diameter was not set
[2023-05-25T23:50:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: Xd
[2023-05-25T23:50:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: 310mb

[2023-05-25T23:50:50] rosheee: then maybe less mb
[2023-05-25T23:51:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: Telegram can convert it to smaller file
[2023-05-25T23:51:09] rosheee: it can
[2023-05-25T23:53:03] rosheee: here
[2023-05-25T23:53:06] rosheee: <video_file>
[2023-05-25T23:53:11] rosheee: first 600mb then 49

[2023-05-26T00:17:27] rosheee: but omg
[2023-05-26T00:17:28] rosheee: ESC
[2023-05-26T00:17:29] rosheee: pls
[2023-05-26T00:17:35] rosheee: how u mounted it for cooling?
[2023-05-26T00:17:42] rosheee: what u used? thermal pad/paste
[2023-05-26T00:18:06] Alex: Paste
[2023-05-26T00:18:14] rosheee: which one and how much and where ?
[2023-05-26T00:18:23] rosheee: u grinded rear of ubox to the alu?
[2023-05-26T00:18:52] rosheee: took paint away then put layer of fuckeria paste on and then u have another layer for the radiator
[2023-05-26T00:19:52] rosheee: more fuckeria if you use thinner thins and mount it directly to the heatspeader
[2023-05-26T00:19:55] rosheee: also it needs air
[2023-05-26T00:20:12] rosheee: so better the shizzl is in front and not rear or u make air channel to it
[2023-05-26T00:20:15] Alex: <photos/photo_8473@25-05-2023_23-12-50.jpg>

[2023-05-26T00:20:40] rosheee: super sexy work
[2023-05-26T00:20:45] Alex: Yeah i cleaned down the paint
[2023-05-26T00:20:59] rosheee: but this
[2023-05-26T00:20:59] rosheee: wrong side
[2023-05-26T00:21:06] rosheee: turn around then better cooling
[2023-05-26T00:21:14] rosheee: a bit better
[2023-05-26T00:21:46] rosheee: or u do airduct
[2023-05-26T00:22:01] Alex: I think we will make an air deflection channel
[2023-05-26T00:22:07] rosheee: the side needs to be cooled has no airflow
[2023-05-26T00:22:29] rosheee: u could also do for sunny days another deck in front that allows air to flow in and out on rear
[2023-05-26T00:22:34] rosheee: then esc gets dual cooling
[2023-05-26T00:23:27] Alex: I live in hungary the sunniest days in the middle of summer will be around 35-40celsius
[2023-05-26T00:23:43] Alex: But i think about a direct air flow box
[2023-05-26T00:24:05] Alex: Or just the front replaced with an opened one
[2023-05-26T00:24:05] rosheee: yes
[2023-05-26T00:24:36] rosheee: i would
[2023-05-26T00:24:45] Alex: But first i try to directing the air flow to the heatsink
[2023-05-26T00:24:48] rosheee: front hole that air can come in and rear a out
[2023-05-26T00:25:01] rosheee: then get heatsink with more finns and mount directly to heatsink
[2023-05-26T00:25:23] rosheee: cut hole in box and use like 4 screws to mount ubox with heatsink inside box
[2023-05-26T00:25:41] rosheee: then if u wanna keep that direction 3d print an airduct which u mount on top
[2023-05-26T00:25:51] rosheee: that directs air to heatsink
[2023-05-26T00:26:09] rosheee: then u have air from front going through box and airduct on top that directs air to heatsink on rear
[2023-05-26T00:26:22] rosheee: and less layers = better
[2023-05-26T00:26:34] Alex: Yeah that is the plan
[2023-05-26T00:26:41] rosheee: but u need better fuckeria heatsink
[2023-05-26T00:26:46] rosheee: the more thins the better
[2023-05-26T00:26:51] rosheee: and less heat transfers
[2023-05-26T00:27:03] rosheee: now ubox -> box -> heatsink radiotor

[2023-05-26T05:16:32] rosheee: :D
[2023-05-26T08:25:50] Mirono escooters: Okidoki, will make working on it easier How I get the second pcb off? Its soldered?
[2023-05-26T09:27:48] rosheee: is it glue fo real or pad?
[2023-05-26T09:28:09] Mirono escooters: Thermal Glue
[2023-05-26T09:28:14] Mirono escooters: Bend alu before releasing

[2023-05-26T09:48:55] Mirono escooters: First get the other motherboard off, its soldered downüôÑ
[2023-05-26T09:54:31] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I always ride them till they blow or I notice the fibers (on CST) to show up. On PMT no idea, had to swap mine early (which looked the same like yours) because the sides were starting to rip.
[2023-05-26T09:55:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <photos/photo_8507@26-05-2023_09-55-51.jpg>
[2023-05-26T09:56:13] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But it lasted me a while, longer than any CST actually but that's probably because I did less burn outs cuz PMT expensive ü´∞ and I got this one gifted üòÖ
[2023-05-26T09:59:58] Mirono escooters: XD

[2023-05-26T15:17:59] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-05-26T16:16:30] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yeah, luckily has not happened to me so far. Only at speeds at like ~40 and you notice early enough.
[2023-05-26T16:17:53] Jan: Up to 290kmh
[2023-05-26T16:18:06] Jan: The 10x3 e-fire
[2023-05-26T16:18:14] Jan: Then it starts to expand
[2023-05-26T16:18:17] Mirono escooters: Wtf
[2023-05-26T16:18:19] Mirono escooters: Crazy
[2023-05-26T16:36:53] AK: Tbh it's not a procedure certified by any agency, so might as well be 1000kmh
[2023-05-26T16:37:32] AK: Pmt tires are great nevertheless though
[2023-05-26T16:38:27] Jan: At 300kph we had sudden tire expansion, so i dont think it will go much higher.
[2023-05-26T16:38:50] Jan: I would stay below 200kph while driving
[2023-05-26T16:39:22] Mirono escooters: lol, on a scoot, good idea
[2023-05-26T16:40:28] AK: What I mean is, since there is no third party agency testing and clear standards, ratings of any sorts are meh
[2023-05-26T16:42:03] Jan: Yes there is no official rating. Use at your own risk
[2023-05-26T16:52:57] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: The trail of that geometry left the class
[2023-05-26T16:53:03] Luis Magalhaes: was the easiest way to put the suspension on the rear...
[2023-05-26T16:53:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: For such high speeds
[2023-05-26T16:53:22] Luis Magalhaes: not the logical way lol
[2023-05-26T16:53:56] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: After gt he will never buy anything else. Maybe except inmotion rs
[2023-05-26T16:53:57] Luis Magalhaes: i bet it will sell anyway üòÇ

[2023-05-26T17:34:01] Mirono escooters: How do I find the dead toll? 2 phases 80kohm, 1 160
[2023-05-26T17:34:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: Maker base?
[2023-05-26T17:35:22] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-05-26T17:35:32] Mirono escooters: Dead mos, apperently 1 cracked and 1 no visual damage

[2023-05-26T17:37:05] Mirono escooters: Now I have to heat this whole heatsink (alu pcb glued down and can't be arsed to bend it off)
[2023-05-26T17:37:09] Mirono escooters: Fun
[2023-05-26T17:37:16] Mirono escooters: First find dead mos, wich will be fun
[2023-05-26T17:38:37] Mirono escooters: Yellow phase short to +
[2023-05-26T17:39:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: You bought used?
[2023-05-26T17:40:41] Mirono escooters: Dead from @Oreohuzky
[2023-05-26T17:40:53] Mirono escooters: 1 has cracked mos, this one also dead one
[2023-05-26T17:41:01] Mirono escooters: Hope it's only 1 since I only have 2 replacement mos ü§¶
[2023-05-26T17:42:45] Mirono escooters: Hotplate is max 120W, so let's hope this shit can heat it Enough..
[2023-05-26T17:42:57] Mirono escooters: It'll take a loong time, since I have to heat casing too
[2023-05-26T18:27:18] Mirono escooters: I think I succeeded

[2023-05-26T18:31:07] Mirono escooters: On the cool other controller, 2 phases 0.5v drop, 1 0
[2023-05-26T18:31:20] Mirono escooters: I've replaced a mos and got rid of the short
[2023-05-26T18:32:15] Konstantin: If hots it's ok
[2023-05-26T18:32:33] Konstantin: Way till 20-30c and drop will rise to normal ;)
[2023-05-26T18:34:10] Konstantin: 0 - looks like shorted... Or gates open. Close them like this. On diode mode.. or just shorting 2 pins
[2023-05-26T18:35:11] Konstantin: <photos/photo_8514@26-05-2023_18-35-11.jpg>

[2023-05-26T18:37:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: This board was water damaged?
[2023-05-26T18:37:40] Mirono escooters: He ps, shouldn't gate be closed when controller is lying for weeks? Or?
[2023-05-26T18:38:41] Konstantin: Not, in process;))) after brrrr just test + wash in water, don't care about pcb ;) anoge 1 after repair was good, it's just for testing ;)
[2023-05-26T18:38:45] Mirono escooters: Instead of guessing the ded mos, I should've measured But hey I guessed right
[2023-05-26T18:39:46] Konstantin: + fast part desolder, set on rex+iron 300¬∞ or 340¬∞, it's was really hot ;))))
[2023-05-26T18:40:56] Konstantin: But not iron do jobs ok. Setting all, fun staf... Old iron... 10$ rex + 1...2 hours time to build this ;)))
[2023-05-26T18:44:57] Konstantin: It's fast to close gates and measuring all if them.
[2023-05-26T18:45:20] Mirono escooters: 10mohm between all phases
[2023-05-26T18:45:21] Mirono escooters: V drop ok
[2023-05-26T18:45:22] Konstantin: On 1 esc in 1 phase, dead 3/4 in my case
[2023-05-26T18:45:28] Mirono escooters: I think it's ok, if gate drivers r ok ofcourse
[2023-05-26T18:47:01] Mirono escooters: Yepla, all good. Reassemble (help) and time to test
[2023-05-26T18:47:45] Mirono escooters: Removed mos shorted output I wonder why only 1 died? And not the pair
[2023-05-26T18:51:20] Mirono escooters: (any easy way to check driver?)
[2023-05-26T18:53:41] Konstantin: Scope or tester + 12v + wire to command drivers to open

[2023-05-26T20:13:56] Oreo huzky: Or might be 5.2 I‚Äôm not sure
[2023-05-26T20:14:24] Mirono escooters: I hope the mcu is fine
[2023-05-26T20:14:29] Mirono escooters: Could you still connect to it after ded?
[2023-05-26T20:16:54] Oreo huzky: No it had short between batt +-
[2023-05-26T20:17:06] Mirono escooters: :/
[2023-05-26T20:18:33] Finn: I got 0.20 and draw 70-90AüòÇ
[2023-05-26T20:18:48] Mirono escooters: It depends on layout
[2023-05-26T20:18:54] Mirono escooters: 75200 usb is on a wire
[2023-05-26T20:18:55] Finn: Youre right
[2023-05-26T20:18:57] Mirono escooters: And sine I lack it

[2023-05-26T20:19:29] Mirono escooters: Banana? Why, so
[2023-05-26T20:19:33] Mirono escooters: Confusing af
[2023-05-26T20:19:35] Oreo huzky: Hm?
[2023-05-26T20:19:37] Unknown: Ok so I thought I had it ready to go. But when I detect bldc motor I get this.
[2023-05-26T20:19:41] Unknown: <photos/photo_8520@26-05-2023_20-19-41.jpg>
[2023-05-26T20:19:47] Oreo huzky: 16s 3p
[2023-05-26T20:19:53] Mirono escooters: Do motor setup
[2023-05-26T20:20:01] Unknown: I did‚Ä¶
[2023-05-26T20:20:06] Mirono escooters: Why not more next to each other
[2023-05-26T20:20:11] Mirono escooters: How old is that vesc?
[2023-05-26T20:20:27] Mirono escooters: I've never seen that tab
[2023-05-26T20:21:16] Mirono escooters: Makes little sense
[2023-05-26T20:21:46] Unknown: I did the initial set up as foc. It‚Äôll make noise and vibrate, it detects the hall sensors but no throttle.
[2023-05-26T20:22:29] Mirono escooters: You have to setup throttle too :-)
[2023-05-26T20:35:55] Oreo huzky: Customer wanted it like that it‚Äôs for xiaomi 1s it needs to fit in 25L battery bag
[2023-05-26T20:39:43] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_8521@26-05-2023_20-39-43.jpg>
[2023-05-26T20:39:56] Mirono escooters: Purely hypothetical, can it be the bt module?
[2023-05-26T20:40:00] Mirono escooters: Its very old, gen1 SPintend
[2023-05-26T20:41:11] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Why no
[2023-05-26T20:42:46] Unknown: Ok I redid the set up from scratch. Got the throttle and basic parameters set and it seems to be working until it hits 10mph or 4amps (with the tire of the ground, no load) Then the motor makes a load vibrating noise and it throws this code.
[2023-05-26T20:43:46] Unknown: That‚Äôs super light throttle smoothly accelerating to about 20% throttle I‚Äôd guess.

[2023-05-26T20:53:15] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-05-26T20:53:21] Mirono escooters: Up ur absolute max current
[2023-05-26T20:53:27] Mirono escooters: To 130? Approx
[2023-05-26T20:53:35] Mirono escooters: No wonder it wasn't happy
[2023-05-26T20:54:11] Unknown: I‚Äôm using the original battery that has a 40a inline fuse.
[2023-05-26T20:54:13] Unknown: Ok will do
[2023-05-26T20:54:19] Konstantin: Abs always more them motor current... always!

[2023-05-26T20:56:07] Unknown: I was thinking it was brakes. That makes way more sense
[2023-05-26T20:57:21] Unknown: <video_file>
[2023-05-26T20:57:29] Unknown: It‚Äôs not shutting off but man it‚Äôs not happy. üòÇ
[2023-05-26T20:58:07] Unknown: <video_file>
[2023-05-26T21:00:38] Unknown: At about 10mph. This is a 2000w 60v motor. It should be going at least 30mph
[2023-05-26T21:00:42] Unknown: Right?
[2023-05-26T21:01:29] Mirono escooters: Its like loosing track of the motor at diff rpm
[2023-05-26T21:01:33] Mirono escooters: Redo motor setup
[2023-05-26T21:01:39] Mirono escooters: And show us the values
[2023-05-26T21:04:19] Unknown: <video_file>

[2023-05-26T21:05:16] Unknown: You know what maybe I‚Äôll bring this with me!
[2023-05-26T21:05:43] Unknown: <photos/photo_8528@26-05-2023_21-05-43.jpg>
[2023-05-26T21:06:26] Unknown: No idea what changed vs the last 5 times I did motor set up. Maybe I needed your guys settings in before I did motor set up?
[2023-05-26T21:07:43] Mirono escooters: Looks top
[2023-05-26T21:08:05] Mirono escooters: Except for brake rub seems fine :)
[2023-05-26T21:21:05] Unknown: That‚Äôs the white plastic if the tires are over 10psi. lol
[2023-05-26T21:21:37] Mirono escooters: Ohh
[2023-05-26T21:26:36] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: No, its just parameter for error overcurrent, for safety if some peaks going higher than that
[2023-05-26T21:28:55] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Are the poles and wheel diameter set right?
[2023-05-26T21:29:03] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Also look at duty
[2023-05-26T21:29:17] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: ~35%
[2023-05-26T21:29:24] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ofc its not max kv (rpm per voltage) of the motor
[2023-05-26T22:01:19] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_8529@26-05-2023_22-01-19.jpg>
[2023-05-26T22:01:19] Mirono escooters: Hah
[2023-05-26T22:01:56] Unknown: Diameter is right. I‚Äôm not sure about the poles.
[2023-05-26T22:05:27] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Smth is wrong with duty
[2023-05-26T22:09:57] Mirono escooters: Hey @Mltra Same phase died (yellow), when trying to do motor spin up Guess it's a dead MOSFET driver/circuit?
[2023-05-26T22:10:02] Mirono escooters: And not worth spending more time
[2023-05-26T22:27:55] Konstantin: When I repair few, only fets was dead. On Yellow, I was swap all 4, but deads only looks like 3
[2023-05-26T22:28:15] Mirono escooters: Swap all 4?
[2023-05-26T22:28:18] Mirono escooters: Guess I'll do that
[2023-05-26T22:28:31] Mirono escooters: I only replaced 1
[2023-05-26T22:39:09] Mirono escooters: I wonder tho, would it give good values (diode v drop and stuff) if there was a dead mos?
[2023-05-26T22:39:18] Mirono escooters: Because it did on all phases
[2023-05-27T00:16:50] Martin Kaktits: you look at them wrong and they die
[2023-05-27T00:17:56] Mirono escooters: I've only killed em once
[2023-05-27T00:41:12] Unknown: Thanks again guys. We made it to the show and the kids have been taking turns riding it around!

[2023-05-27T00:43:04] Mirono escooters: Looks lovely
[2023-05-27T00:46:49] Martin Kaktits: Has someone done HFI setup successfully? specifically on vsett 10 motor and I could kina just copy the settings? üòÖ or it doesnt work like that?
[2023-05-27T02:17:01] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: So, @LizardDoggo hit a curb after a 20km ride and now his motor is acting strange. 1. Phase plugs are looking fine 2. The motor inside looks like new My idea would be a broken mosfet leg because it's mounted only on the MOSFETs, maybe the force was enough to break something there? Need to check tomorrow ü§∑ Any other ideas or things we can measure?
[2023-05-27T02:18:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes
[2023-05-27T02:19:58] Finn: Yeah were gonna do that tomorroüòÇ
[2023-05-27T02:45:46] Happy Giraffe: Haha brakes is regen
[2023-05-27T02:47:15] Happy Giraffe: Just take a look into every setting branch on the app
[2023-05-27T02:47:45] Happy Giraffe: There are the limits, settings and fine tuning option for each function
[2023-05-27T02:51:30] Happy Giraffe: But in the regen section you might wanna be careful to only put like 6A battery regen max depending on cells as your pack is 3p. Also idk how the regen behaves when battery is full so be aware of that if kids go downhill on full batt and use hard ebrake (perhaps allow bit higher maximum voltage than usual)üëç
[2023-05-27T04:12:48] Unknown: The Flipsky is throwing a high voltage error when I hook up my 72v battery that is only 82v. Is that normal? What is the max voltage?

[2023-05-27T09:42:41] Mirono escooters: Stock max v is below 20s
[2023-05-27T09:42:46] Mirono escooters: You can change it in settings
[2023-05-27T11:01:20] Finn: Nkon recovered cells from battery packs
[2023-05-27T11:01:37] Mirono escooters: Always good deal
[2023-05-27T11:01:39] Finn: Looks like new except some with still copper leftover
[2023-05-27T11:02:11] Finn: 315‚Ç¨ for 100
[2023-05-27T11:02:14] Finn: Pretty good
[2023-05-27T11:02:51] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2023-05-27T11:02:57] Mirono escooters: In today's standards very good
[2023-05-27T11:11:22] Finn: <photos/photo_8537@27-05-2023_11-11-22.jpg>
[2023-05-27T11:11:25] Finn: Tf
[2023-05-27T11:11:30] Finn: Thats the problem?
[2023-05-27T11:13:20] Mirono escooters: Seems like they moved a bit, problably snapped a leg?
[2023-05-27T13:06:54] Finn: Nah i tested all legs
[2023-05-27T13:07:03] Finn: But still not working
[2023-05-27T13:07:18] Mirono escooters: Maybe a trace went rip, pcb looks liitle bend
[2023-05-27T14:01:26] √óÔº°ÔºØÔº≤ÔºµÔº≥√ó: No_limited firmware
[2023-05-27T14:46:03] Happy Giraffe: Yes, this plays also important part in preventing ebrake shenanigans. If bms allows tiny bit raised voltage then whole setup becomes more safe
[2023-05-27T19:23:00] Unknown: So new weird thing. The Maximum wattage keeps resetting after a minute or two at random so far only when I come to a stop. It usually resets itself to 500w, 600w or 700w and it‚Äôs zeros out braking. I also can‚Äôt keep the trip to stay on longer than a couple minutes.

[2023-05-27T19:25:27] Unknown: I deleted all my profiles today. Set everything back up, writing to the VESC on every page, then made one profile and it‚Äôs still doing it.
[2023-05-27T19:25:27] JPPL: Try write read value, and rewrite
[2023-05-27T19:25:36] JPPL: Then turn off or stop test and check
[2023-05-27T19:25:49] JPPL: Clear cache and data on phone?
[2023-05-27T19:26:08] JPPL: Also after, desinstall and reinstall vesc tools
[2023-05-27T19:28:25] Unknown: I wrote 3000 and after read it say‚Äôs 3000. I‚Äôm going to give it a minute and see what it say‚Äôs. The weird thing is the scooter will definitely operate at 3000w just fine so it‚Äôs definitely writing. But after a minute or two it‚Äôll go back to a random low wattage.
[2023-05-27T20:07:48] Unknown: <video_file>
[2023-05-27T20:11:15] Unknown: Sorry about the music. Didn‚Äôt know it records that. lol. I raised the wattage, did write, read. Pulled the throttle and it limited it to 4mph but 790w peak. Went over and hit read. Changed the wattage again. Same thing so I literally just hit read and went back and it went exactly 10mph. Didn‚Äôt write anything. Waited and it reset its own trip. Went back to read and it was 500w. This is weird.
[2023-05-27T20:11:51] Unknown: I‚Äôm going to uninstall and maybe flash the firmware.
[2023-05-27T20:46:06] Happy Giraffe: Just a basic thing but are you sure you press "write"?
[2023-05-27T20:47:52] Unknown: Ya you can see in the bottom it even confirms write. Also I‚Äôd if I‚Äôm on the street, click wire then go it‚Äôll do 3000w no problem until I come to a stop.
[2023-05-27T21:08:11] JPPL: All wiring correct?
[2023-05-27T21:08:32] JPPL: Seems like something is writing that parameter üòÖ
[2023-05-27T21:08:57] JPPL: Dumb thing, try other phone
[2023-05-27T21:20:38] Happy Giraffe: Does it happen if phone not connected while riding?
[2023-05-27T21:27:47] Unknown: Yes. I have to reconnect to keep raising the wattage.
[2023-05-27T21:28:22] Unknown: I‚Äôm writing it from Linux this time and am going to try a couple times.
[2023-05-27T21:52:53] Happy Giraffe: All firmwares are updated?
[2023-05-27T21:54:50] Unknown: I just put on 6.02 no limit and I‚Äôm redoing everything now.
[2023-05-27T22:24:08] AK: Well, what can be, is simple flash wear
[2023-05-27T22:24:43] AK: If you did a lot of flashing, and writing parameters, the reality is, flash might have worn enough to fail writing
[2023-05-27T22:25:25] Mirono escooters: Already?
[2023-05-27T22:25:28] Mirono escooters: That seems excessive
[2023-05-27T22:27:40] AK: Well the 100 000 writes are an average
[2023-05-27T22:27:59] AK: Someone somewhere has his stm go old at 100 cycles, that's reality üò≠
[2023-05-27T22:30:36] Mirono escooters: Whaaa
[2023-05-27T22:30:54] Mirono escooters: Can it just be dumping too much into cache or SMTH? And it overriding itself

[2023-05-28T00:11:58] JPPL: All must be studied, all spacers, shocks, damper
[2023-05-28T00:12:21] JPPL: Overall by experience I don't look to display
[2023-05-28T00:12:27] JPPL: I like to seat on escooter
[2023-05-28T00:12:31] JPPL: And check display data
[2023-05-28T00:12:41] JPPL: So that spot is also new for me but I'm enjoying
[2023-05-28T00:13:00] Ion: What shocks do you use? Very cool build
[2023-05-28T00:13:01] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I have no issues with that speed on my segway, without dampers, steering is not tightened at all. Just stock steering
[2023-05-28T00:13:11] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Can do turns aswell, not only forward line
[2023-05-28T00:13:14] Mirono escooters: Segway is boss
[2023-05-28T00:13:27] JPPL: Nice bro, to be honest I never tryed without damper
[2023-05-28T00:13:34] JPPL: Concern issue
[2023-05-28T00:13:34] Jan: üëåüëåüî•
[2023-05-28T00:13:53] JPPL: <video_file>
[2023-05-28T00:13:59] JPPL: Other with Kelly
[2023-05-28T00:14:12] JPPL: <video_file>
[2023-05-28T00:14:14] JPPL: Other
[2023-05-28T00:14:18] JPPL: Enogh
[2023-05-28T00:14:55] JPPL: I need better road to explore deeper fieldweaking and other parameters
[2023-05-28T00:15:05] JPPL: Dnm 22ar
[2023-05-28T00:15:30] JPPL: Exa 291 is nice but Dnm much better
[2023-05-28T00:15:41] Mirono escooters: I wish dji did gps overlay
[2023-05-28T00:16:08] JPPL: They don't ? Even with other kind of telemetry app?
[2023-05-28T00:16:22] JPPL: To read DJI values
[2023-05-28T00:16:30] Mirono escooters: Sadly no
[2023-05-28T00:16:36] Mirono escooters: Have to video edit it in
[2023-05-28T00:16:48] JPPL: It's nice because I like to have 2/3 gps trackers
[2023-05-28T00:16:58] JPPL: Because there is always 1/2km diference
[2023-05-28T00:17:08] JPPL: Just to make sure more or less
[2023-05-28T00:17:29] JPPL: Also with insta360 etc i think
[2023-05-28T00:41:18] Luis Magalhaes: Slow scooter
[2023-05-28T00:41:21] Luis Magalhaes: üòÇ
[2023-05-28T01:08:43] JPPL: For now poor, not calibrate KP or ki parameters
[2023-05-28T01:08:45] JPPL: 120a
[2023-05-28T01:09:06] Mirono escooters: Kp/ki?
[2023-05-28T01:09:08] JPPL: Not fast drag start
[2023-05-28T01:10:01] JPPL: Similar with Kelly we can put higher values to make it stronger
[2023-05-28T01:10:12] JPPL: More torque
[2023-05-28T01:11:02] Luis Magalhaes: he wants to adjust the way the controller works to be more agrecive
[2023-05-28T01:15:03] JPPL: Acceleration is linear
[2023-05-28T01:15:08] JPPL: No breaks or deaths
[2023-05-28T01:15:28] JPPL: But not fast as I'm used and like on other setups
[2023-05-28T01:15:59] JPPL: It's slow start and then linear and fast acceleration
[2023-05-28T01:16:20] JPPL: Adc parameters can be tweaked as motor KP/ki
[2023-05-28T01:16:48] JPPL: But for project, torque is not needed
[2023-05-28T01:17:10] JPPL: Good amp yes üòç
[2023-05-28T01:21:35] Simone: <photos/photo_8555@28-05-2023_01-21-35.jpg>
[2023-05-28T01:23:09] Simone: First speed test on the new frame but I think I burn the motors üòÇ
[2023-05-28T01:35:29] Simone: could have done even 155 in my opinion...
[2023-05-28T01:36:42] JPPL: Wow tell us more
[2023-05-28T01:37:20] Ion: What scooter frame did you use as a base? 150kph is crazy
[2023-05-28T01:38:19] rosheee: ^^
[2023-05-28T01:39:11] rosheee: On 10inch?
[2023-05-28T01:39:31] Simone: made by me using the front fusions of the vsett11 and the rear of the zero11x
[2023-05-28T01:39:56] Simone: No 11inch...next time test with 10inch
[2023-05-28T01:40:06] rosheee: So 145 on 11inch?
[2023-05-28T01:40:24] Simone: Yes but i can do more speed
[2023-05-28T01:41:06] JPPL: How was speed development from 140 to 145?
[2023-05-28T01:41:12] JPPL: Slow or continuous
[2023-05-28T01:41:55] Simone: today I'm assembling the new engines on the kaboo mantis ... I think it can reach more than 130 ...
[2023-05-28T01:42:07] Simone: continuous
[2023-05-28T01:43:08] JPPL: Ok, i will upgrade my results here
[2023-05-28T01:43:09] Simone: I was afraid to dare more ... I had no protection
[2023-05-28T01:44:28] JPPL: I really need to invest on better protection too
[2023-05-28T01:45:30] JPPL: Was 20s or plus?
[2023-05-28T01:45:57] JPPL: I can do test with 22s too
[2023-05-28T01:47:25] Simone: 22s on escooter 11inch...21s on mantis 10inch
[2023-05-28T01:50:33] rosheee: U use vesc or kelly?
[2023-05-28T01:50:33] rosheee: And what battery xD?
[2023-05-28T01:50:44] JPPL: Nice
[2023-05-28T01:56:51] Simone: Kelly 7230s and kelly 7212s
[2023-05-28T01:57:09] Simone: 22s10p samsung 40t 21s6p sony vtc6a
[2023-05-28T01:58:59] Ion: I used to have a mantis and liked it a lot. If you dont mind, could you send some pics of the finished build :)
[2023-05-28T01:59:43] Simone: Sure...tomorrow finish assembly and i try
[2023-05-28T02:00:16] Luis Magalhaes: oh shit lolol
[2023-05-28T02:13:40] rosheee: ah ok :D
[2023-05-28T02:32:46] Luis Magalhaes: @roscheeee is going to use 400A Fw now üòÜüòÇ
[2023-05-28T02:34:09] Luis Magalhaes: kaabo is paolo scooter now
[2023-05-28T02:34:43] Luis Magalhaes: now have to raise it like the new one üòÇ
[2023-05-28T02:36:58] rosheee: Ah no
[2023-05-28T02:37:53] Jan: But its 11inch right?
[2023-05-28T02:38:11] rosheee: yas
[2023-05-28T02:38:19] rosheee: and 22S and 21S
[2023-05-28T02:38:22] rosheee: with more fuckeria amps ^^
[2023-05-28T02:38:54] rosheee: ah 7212 idk nah
[2023-05-28T02:38:56] rosheee: but 11" ^^
[2023-05-28T02:39:03] rosheee: so more speed0rama with 11"
[2023-05-28T02:39:06] rosheee: + more V + more A
[2023-05-28T02:39:18] rosheee: so no prob
[2023-05-28T02:39:27] rosheee: mantis 145?
[2023-05-28T02:39:39] rosheee: yes but mantis 21S?
[2023-05-28T02:39:44] rosheee: ah then ez ^^
[2023-05-28T02:39:50] rosheee: +130 we did
[2023-05-28T02:39:54] rosheee: 133-134 gps
[2023-05-28T02:40:03] rosheee: but even if someone faster me happy
[2023-05-28T02:40:07] rosheee: nah
[2023-05-28T02:42:58] rosheee: yes
[2023-05-28T02:43:02] rosheee: but step by step
[2023-05-28T02:43:08] rosheee: redo s√ºperfuckeria run again
[2023-05-28T03:11:15] Luis Magalhaes: thats the way üòÅ
[2023-05-28T03:16:26] rosheee: have to fix my 20S as well ^^' rebuild i did for jan after i crashed his is fuckeria
[2023-05-28T03:16:54] rosheee: mine atm: wobble feels like 300kg steering crap tires imbalanced
[2023-05-28T03:54:03] Oreo huzky: I have bad tires too but do you think they will be fine for high speed?
[2023-05-28T03:55:01] Oreo huzky: The rear one looks a bit bad
[2023-05-28T03:58:38] JPPL: They fine
[2023-05-28T04:06:51] Oreo huzky: Thanks
[2023-05-28T06:21:08] rosheee: whatb ad tires?
[2023-05-28T06:29:36] Oreo huzky: Pmt slick
[2023-05-28T06:44:35] rosheee: why u ask XD?
[2023-05-28T06:44:38] rosheee: they will be good
[2023-05-28T06:44:39] rosheee: üòÉ
[2023-05-28T06:44:43] rosheee: not in rain ^^
[2023-05-28T09:38:21] Face de Pin Suc√©: Haha, we can do higher speeds, but for now, working on performance on tracks üòÅ
[2023-05-28T09:40:37] Face de Pin Suc√©: And we still only 20S üòÅ
[2023-05-28T09:56:17] rosheee: yas
[2023-05-28T10:25:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: Still waiting for you to come to Carole 9/10/11 üòú
[2023-05-28T10:25:26] rosheee: XD
[2023-05-28T10:25:33] rosheee: MY CRAPPERIA NOT WORK CORRECZ
[2023-05-28T10:25:36] rosheee: correct
[2023-05-28T10:32:56] Face de Pin Suc√©: You have 2 fucking weeks to make it work correct üòÅ
[2023-05-28T12:02:21] rosheee: What about the hope i need xD?
[2023-05-28T12:02:27] rosheee: I need V4 X4
[2023-05-28T12:02:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: If you want I have in stock a pair of V4s x) black/red
[2023-05-28T12:03:02] Face de Pin Suc√©: Tech4 V4
[2023-05-28T12:04:21] rosheee: Send xD
[2023-05-28T12:04:33] rosheee: Only right side
[2023-05-28T12:08:22] Face de Pin Suc√©: What I do with left side ? üò≠
[2023-05-28T12:08:32] Face de Pin Suc√©: But okay I can send you right side x)
[2023-05-28T12:10:22] Face de Pin Suc√©: Please register on website
[2023-05-28T13:21:02] AK: What's up with 6.05 and lisp? I get eval_errors with unrelated lines
[2023-05-28T13:24:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: There was a change with the buf array create, maybe you missed that.
[2023-05-28T13:27:11] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: https://github.com/m365fw/vesc_m365_dash/commit/b76c7bc01b31a7d2ade831608898da6dfd7f66fb Might be the same case for you.
[2023-05-28T13:27:13] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But I don't know without your code and error.
[2023-05-28T13:28:01] AK: yeah, that was it
[2023-05-28T13:28:20] AK: What caught me that line error numbers were completely unrelated
[2023-05-28T13:33:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes it is really annoying. They are absolutely useless. I had to do a lot of prints to actually figure out the line.
[2023-05-28T13:34:56] AK: Tbh nowadays with the "stream" it's not that painful
[2023-05-28T13:35:11] AK: really enjoying the streaming
[2023-05-28T13:37:39] Happy Giraffe: I think he has Maguraü§î
[2023-05-28T13:37:51] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-05-28T13:45:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: What battery ?
[2023-05-28T15:50:44] JPPL: Heyy
[2023-05-28T15:51:00] JPPL: Magura installed, not finish cables cut
[2023-05-28T15:51:07] JPPL: 40t 20s10p
[2023-05-28T15:51:19] rosheee: suc√©
[2023-05-28T16:19:39] Simone: <photos/photo_8556@28-05-2023_16-19-39.jpg>
[2023-05-28T16:19:46] Simone: 10inch ready
[2023-05-28T16:30:38] AK: Wait, these changes mean it's going to be non-compatible with anything below 6.05, why would they do that, might have kept an alias
[2023-05-28T16:41:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Before was 50mm 21x3
[2023-05-28T16:50:38] Jan: Isnt it 22x3 60h?
[2023-05-28T17:01:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: Roger also has these motors , but he didn‚Äôt liked it because of small wires
[2023-05-28T17:35:19] rosheee: ^^?
[2023-05-28T17:35:29] rosheee: lukas has @PaoloWu mantus fuckeria motors
[2023-05-28T17:36:11] rosheee: like vsett then ^^
[2023-05-28T17:36:16] rosheee: with 20S
[2023-05-28T17:38:49] rosheee: nice
[2023-05-28T17:38:52] rosheee: and heat also ^^
[2023-05-28T17:40:17] rosheee: 2 us as well
[2023-05-28T17:40:26] rosheee: but when u go full fuckeria and get 90-100degrees at topspeed ^^'
[2023-05-28T17:54:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: But what are windings of the motors you compare, 50H, 60H ?
[2023-05-28T17:57:34] JPPL: Vesc Will need different config for different motors, not just winding
[2023-05-28T17:57:43] JPPL: With Kelly is the same
[2023-05-28T17:58:49] JPPL: I can get almost same torque on diferente winding with parameters tweaking. Not exactly same response but similar
[2023-05-28T17:59:05] JPPL: This in my Kelly experience, vesc I'm learning
[2023-05-28T18:00:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: That is impossible, no matter the controller, if you give same power, you CANNOT have the same torque range on the motor, so you cannot have same torque at same speed with different windings, it's not about parameters, it's about physics
[2023-05-28T18:01:03] Simone: I agree
[2023-05-28T18:01:25] JPPL: True physics matter most
[2023-05-28T18:01:32] JPPL: I give example
[2023-05-28T18:01:34] JPPL: On kelly
[2023-05-28T18:01:47] JPPL: With hm motors 60h i got amazing torque with default settings
[2023-05-28T18:01:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: If you have high speed windings, 7212S Kelly doesn't provide enough phase current
[2023-05-28T18:02:04] JPPL: When I tryed wolf motors
[2023-05-28T18:02:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: 33x2 winding with 7212
[2023-05-28T18:02:23] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, 33x2 with 7212 is impossible to use
[2023-05-28T18:02:28] JPPL: They were poor in torque, but with few settings I got it with nice torque same amps
[2023-05-28T18:02:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think too 7212 is no enough
[2023-05-28T18:03:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: I've experienced it 2-3 years ago about 33x2 and 7212
[2023-05-28T18:05:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: Unfortunately I never had 7212, and don‚Äôt know it
[2023-05-28T18:05:46] Face de Pin Suc√©: Well it's 120A phase (with a peak around 170A)
[2023-05-28T18:05:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: I never had Kelly work 100% for really ahahah
[2023-05-28T18:06:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: Always had problem
[2023-05-28T18:06:37] Face de Pin Suc√©: Kelly is shit, but it works, I've had multiple scooters with Kellys
[2023-05-28T18:06:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: My first 7218 was defective
[2023-05-28T18:06:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: I thought was my own problem, but‚Ä¶.
[2023-05-28T18:07:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: And you know fast ride customer service üí©‚Ä¶
[2023-05-28T18:07:40] Face de Pin Suc√©: Oh damn hahaha
[2023-05-28T18:08:48] JPPL: Kelly is amazing üòå rock solid, good performance, best before vesc
[2023-05-28T18:09:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: They even don‚Äôt reply me for buying it hahaha, how you can think that they replace
[2023-05-28T18:09:36] Luis Magalhaes: Not with same amps, the tweaks you made make the controllers overshoot amps above parameters
[2023-05-28T18:10:46] JPPL: True, winding(physics) control most
[2023-05-28T18:11:43] Luis Magalhaes: Had same problem, they told me they cant see all emails because they have lots os customers üòÖ
[2023-05-28T18:12:48] Luis Magalhaes: Speed or torque is all about voltage and kv then amps to perform well with motors then black magic FW üòÇ
[2023-05-28T18:58:33] rosheee: http://twitch.tv/roscheeee/ fixed ehehe
[2023-05-28T19:41:11] Jason Nelson: I don't know if this has been mentioned yet but I just noticed flipsky has integrated the Bluetooth into their new board
[2023-05-28T19:41:15] Jason Nelson: <photos/photo_8557@28-05-2023_19-41-15.jpg>
[2023-05-28T19:41:50] Konstantin: I found only Bluetooth added... Nothing interesting...
[2023-05-28T19:42:14] Jason Nelson: Still no power control

[2023-05-28T20:25:40] Mirono escooters: Price is weird
[2023-05-28T20:27:35] Happy Giraffe: Just dont buy the cheapest spintend vesc as its crap based on the reviewsüòÇ
[2023-05-28T20:28:01] Jan: Alu 20s box when?
[2023-05-28T20:28:24] Jan: It feels like @artBula spin-y
[2023-05-28T20:29:57] Mirono escooters: Oh we know itis
[2023-05-28T20:30:42] Mirono escooters: But come on "Safty" "Electircal"
[2023-05-28T20:30:46] Mirono escooters: How hard is it
[2023-05-28T20:30:54] Mirono escooters: It totally lowers my trust
[2023-05-28T20:31:24] Mirono escooters: Ps, SPintend doesn't do IOSS, wich sucks. Tax+ vat. One reason why I don't buy it Alieexpress and flipsky/ whatever has it included
[2023-05-28T21:18:13] Luis Magalhaes: The ubox red i buy from then did not pay any taxes üòÇ
[2023-05-28T21:18:45] Luis Magalhaes: Because "portugal" üòÇ
[2023-05-28T21:19:03] Luis Magalhaes: Now i think its harder to pass and should pay for it
[2023-05-28T21:24:40] Mirono escooters: Yeah, belgium no change
[2023-05-28T21:24:43] Mirono escooters: Not even registered mail
[2023-05-28T22:06:37] rosheee: sad
[2023-05-28T22:27:49] Mirono escooters: O? Description says 18
[2023-05-28T22:29:14] Jan: But its 6fet right?
[2023-05-28T22:29:42] Jan: Need more safety margins in the future
[2023-05-28T22:29:51] Jan: G30 is running tight
[2023-05-28T22:30:31] Jan: Currently a single mosfet handles up to 2kW
[2023-05-28T22:31:24] Jan: Yeah
[2023-05-28T22:33:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: No possible test until you‚Äôre at airport Xd
[2023-05-28T22:37:25] Jan: I think G30 with 10inch hub is just to small for 150kph
[2023-05-28T22:37:33] Jan: Proper 11inch frame req
[2023-05-28T22:38:34] Jan: PMT 10x3 perfect tire for me
[2023-05-28T22:39:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: Cst best if g30 can fit wide tire
[2023-05-28T22:39:43] Happy Giraffe: For assisted ebike use single ubox never reached above 40cüåö
[2023-05-28T22:41:20] Jan: Have you tried both?
[2023-05-28T22:44:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: I mean can‚Äôt fit, sorry
[2023-05-28T22:44:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: Too large and touch the curved profile
[2023-05-28T22:46:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2023-05-28T22:46:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: With wide rim, it has a lot much grip
[2023-05-28T22:47:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: Around double of surface touching ground, and the rubber compound is even very good
[2023-05-28T22:47:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: I told you, can‚Äôt fit
[2023-05-28T22:47:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ly standard rim also

[2023-05-28T22:48:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: But not for this
[2023-05-28T22:48:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2023-05-28T22:48:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: Same motor as nami klima
[2023-05-28T22:49:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not, 135 sadly
[2023-05-28T22:51:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: No, I tested already
[2023-05-28T22:51:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: Rim is double of tire width
[2023-05-28T22:53:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: Sorry but I never liked 10 inch pmt
[2023-05-28T22:53:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: I got 10 x defective tire and never warranty üòÜ
[2023-05-28T22:53:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: No lol
[2023-05-28T22:54:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: Pmt 10x2.5
[2023-05-28T22:55:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because they did internal diameter 6.1 thinking is same as xiaomi
[2023-05-28T22:55:49] rosheee: ^^ GOT JHERE
[2023-05-28T22:55:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because 10 inch version is born with xiaomi
[2023-05-28T22:55:58] rosheee: <sticker>
[2023-05-28T22:56:11] rosheee: btw ^^' the little foceria runs suc√© now
[2023-05-28T22:56:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2023-05-28T22:56:14] rosheee: tronics as well
[2023-05-28T22:56:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: @mirkus74 had same issue
[2023-05-28T22:57:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: Also 10x3 had issues
[2023-05-28T22:57:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: Now is 6‚Äù, before was 6.1‚Äù
[2023-05-28T23:01:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: Should be 22x3
[2023-05-28T23:02:56] rosheee: lol
[2023-05-28T23:03:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: How much it does at freewheel
[2023-05-28T23:04:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt know more when people says ‚Äúgood torque‚Äù
[2023-05-28T23:04:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: Everyone said me nami burn e is a monster
[2023-05-28T23:04:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: I tried, but it‚Äôs üêåüòÇ
[2023-05-28T23:05:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: Nami owner tried mine and says with half throttle it‚Äôs no possible to control
[2023-05-28T23:07:12] Mirko Boni: Paolo, I remember it very well. In fact, you sent me the 10x2.50 csts later. But now I know that the pmt fixed them. They no longer have that flaw
[2023-05-28T23:07:37] Mirko Boni: Today here in my city I saw a nami viper..I didn't like it so much..
[2023-05-28T23:09:15] Mirko Boni: It has rough welds, the paint is rough..
[2023-05-28T23:10:32] Mirko Boni: Exactly.. Today I was with Vittorio and we stopped this Indian boy..

[2023-05-28T23:14:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Now I got wolf with super high torque motor
[2023-05-28T23:14:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: Maybe best 0-80 of ever Xd
[2023-05-28T23:14:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: Same as nami
[2023-05-28T23:15:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: But push it with double of current + fw
[2023-05-28T23:15:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: It was 22x3 winding
[2023-05-28T23:15:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: 127kmh max , with 90A fw and 150A batt
[2023-05-28T23:15:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2023-05-28T23:16:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt need it for long rides, I just like felt adrenaline
[2023-05-28T23:16:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: I do 3km and stop hahaha
[2023-05-28T23:18:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: No because after 90kmh it dies hahaha
[2023-05-28T23:24:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: Wolf has small deck
[2023-05-28T23:24:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: 20s7p is max that can fit
[2023-05-28T23:27:14] Mirko Boni: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-05-28T23:27:50] Mirko Boni: Paolo but my standard engines are 22x3?
[2023-05-28T23:32:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: 17x4
[2023-05-28T23:38:39] Mirko Boni: So 22x3 is high kv?
[2023-05-28T23:42:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2023-05-28T23:42:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: It is standard KV
[2023-05-28T23:42:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Everyone has its theory, to now everyone said 17x4 is standard kv
[2023-05-28T23:42:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: 17x4 isn't standard KV
[2023-05-28T23:43:11] Face de Pin Suc√©: It is torque KV
[2023-05-28T23:43:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: But people call it standard kv ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2023-05-28T23:43:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because exist also 13x5 winding
[2023-05-28T23:43:41] Face de Pin Suc√©: Especially at the voltages we all operate right now
[2023-05-28T23:44:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: As also exist 60x1 lol
[2023-05-28T23:44:11] Face de Pin Suc√©: Well, this is not torque KV it is useless KV
[2023-05-28T23:44:16] Face de Pin Suc√©: Same for this one
[2023-05-28T23:44:37] Face de Pin Suc√©: If you use 60x1, you will burn motor before getting the speed you could reach
[2023-05-28T23:45:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: If you use 13x5 it is inappropriate for 14-22S batteries with 10-11 inch motors
[2023-05-28T23:45:21] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: But you can record a lot of stupid tiktoks for stupid idiots :D that you have the fastest scooter in the world that overtakes Lamborghini
[2023-05-28T23:46:02] Face de Pin Suc√©: With free air spinning motors ? ü§£
[2023-05-28T23:46:11] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Yes
[2023-05-28T23:46:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, but who cares about Tiktok ? üòú
[2023-05-28T23:47:24] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: A little bit of a dumb people
[2023-05-28T23:48:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: You can put 20 inch tire as weped dark knight in 6.5inch rimüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-05-28T23:49:04] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, but those standards doesn't work anymore
[2023-05-28T23:49:12] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: so?)
[2023-05-28T23:49:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: We are assuming around 14-22S batteries 10-11-12 inch tyres
[2023-05-28T23:49:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: Then of course if you go for 10000inch and 350V battery, it doesn't work anymore

[2023-05-29T09:02:02] Face de Pin Suc√©: Well, it doesn't do anything for me here
[2023-05-29T10:29:26] Mirono escooters: Seems own build
[2023-05-29T10:29:33] Mirono escooters: We have those in BE, for forest riding
[2023-05-29T10:29:37] Mirono escooters: Usually batt packback
[2023-05-29T11:09:53] Simone: Has anyone tried a system to turn off flipsky/makerbase yet?
[2023-05-29T11:15:30] AK: Yes, just use the EN leg on the 12v stepdown
[2023-05-29T11:24:28] Unknown: Vesc has arrived what do you say connect it to my current battery (48/10)or wait a month for 60v
[2023-05-29T11:27:33] Mirono escooters: Why not
[2023-05-29T11:39:33] JPPL: Best one is spinted, configurable, but personly use BMS to turn off/on, but not all vesc setups gave smartbms, normally yes
[2023-05-29T11:55:02] Simone: I know that interrupting and re-energizing the vesc via the bms will ruin it in the long run..
[2023-05-29T11:55:54] Mirono escooters: Nop..
[2023-05-29T11:56:01] AK: Of course, he is right
[2023-05-29T11:56:06] Mirono escooters: It was only dangerous with the cheap vescs, cutting when riding
[2023-05-29T11:56:11] AK: You have stupidly high currents to charge capacitors
[2023-05-29T11:56:20] Mirono escooters: There's nothing wrong with turning it off via bms
[2023-05-29T11:56:25] Mirono escooters: Ant BMS has pre charge current..
[2023-05-29T11:56:30] Mirono escooters: ü§∑üòú
[2023-05-29T11:56:44] Simone: Jk no ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-05-29T11:56:49] Mirono escooters: ü§∑
[2023-05-29T11:56:58] Mirono escooters: Sure? Jk is known as one of the best
[2023-05-29T11:56:59] AK: Really? never noticed, what's it called in the config?
[2023-05-29T11:57:06] Mirono escooters: Precharge current lol
[2023-05-29T11:58:28] Mirono escooters: It saved my mp2 too
[2023-05-29T11:58:46] Mirono escooters: I had a ceramic cap shorting, precharge current was only 5a so it was a spark, but not burning pcb spark üòú
[2023-05-29T12:00:59] AK: In system params or what? It does not really make senaw to me, how that would work, I have to test it on a bench
[2023-05-29T12:02:47] Mirono escooters: Starting curr then, idk why yours name is diff
[2023-05-29T12:03:06] Mirono escooters: I just know precharge works and is very nice :-)
[2023-05-29T12:05:30] AK: Yeah, that is certainly a nice feature
[2023-05-29T12:06:00] Mirono escooters: There's 1 dedicated mos for it We discussed it here some time ago
[2023-05-29T12:06:13] Mirono escooters: @Mltra asked about it I think
[2023-05-29T12:09:46] AK: Could be, topology-wise there is one separate fet for it
[2023-05-29T12:12:17] Mirono escooters: It makes a high pitched sound when u enable it And after x time, if not precharged, it stops (saved me vesc)
[2023-05-29T12:14:34] AK: What do you mean with not precharged, that the draw is still higher than requested?
[2023-05-29T12:14:57] Mirono escooters: If after x seconds, it still has to supply the limited current ,it'll stop
[2023-05-29T12:15:02] Mirono escooters: As it detected a short per say
[2023-05-29T12:16:31] AK: Nice, that is very cool
[2023-05-29T12:16:47] AK: why do they have 0 documentation on stuff like that...
[2023-05-29T12:24:26] JPPL: What starting or precharge current you use?
[2023-05-29T12:26:49] JPPL: Mine ia at 20, no problems at all until today
[2023-05-29T12:27:29] Mirono escooters: I use 20
[2023-05-29T12:27:52] Mirono escooters: Could problably go with lower but, mp2 I know handles it
[2023-05-29T12:28:34] Mirono escooters: Chinaü§∑ it's sad but, eh
[2023-05-29T12:28:37] JPPL: We can so it by Bluetooth or by button on 1st serie
[2023-05-29T12:28:38] Mirono escooters: Playing with settings is fun
[2023-05-29T12:28:52] Mirono escooters: Some ant bmses have a button on off, you can request it
[2023-05-29T12:29:25] JPPL: Even new touch displays I think can do it?
[2023-05-29T12:29:30] Mirono escooters: Oh what happened
[2023-05-29T12:29:31] JPPL: For antbms
[2023-05-29T12:29:39] Mirono escooters: I think so
[2023-05-29T12:29:42] Mirono escooters: I don't use them
[2023-05-29T12:30:02] JPPL: I say is ok, no problems ;)
[2023-05-29T12:30:33] Mirono escooters: Aha
[2023-05-29T12:30:52] JPPL: Good option but better phone for me
[2023-05-29T12:31:05] JPPL: Rainy days in Portugal, soon few tests
[2023-05-29T12:31:11] JPPL: Keep rocking!
[2023-05-29T14:43:42] Simone: I need your help/opinion
[2023-05-29T14:44:20] Simone: After the test where I hit 145kmh both motors lost power and are making weird noises
[2023-05-29T14:44:43] Simone: kelly reports error hall
[2023-05-29T14:45:05] Simone: I've opened the motors and they don't seem to burn out
[2023-05-29T14:45:29] Simone: could it be that only the halls burned down? and why?
[2023-05-29T14:46:32] Simone: I also checked (only one because it was the one with the blackened cable protection)
[2023-05-29T14:46:52] Simone: the phase leads directly soldered to the stator but they look ok
[2023-05-29T14:47:25] Simone: I do not know what to do üò¢
[2023-05-29T14:49:31] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Looks like burned motors
[2023-05-29T14:50:43] Simone: probably so but they don't blacken or anything?
[2023-05-29T15:06:47] Mirono escooters: Yeh wrong group for Kelly xD
[2023-05-29T15:06:48] Mirono escooters: Ancient
[2023-05-29T15:07:53] Simone: I think the controller is of little importance...a potentially burnt engine is both on kelly and on vesc
[2023-05-29T15:08:18] Mirono escooters: ü§∑ with vesc we could see all motor values, redo setup, blabla
[2023-05-29T15:08:38] Mirono escooters: Halls are like 80*? 100*? First thing to burn
[2023-05-29T15:09:56] Simone: I honestly don't know the maximum operating temperature of the halls... I'm ignorant about it
[2023-05-29T15:11:28] Mirono escooters: :-) not much
[2023-05-29T15:11:34] Mirono escooters: 80* for 41f I think
[2023-05-29T15:15:16] Simone: This motor have 41F ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-05-29T15:15:29] Mirono escooters: Its commonly used
[2023-05-29T15:16:15] Simone: Are there any that can withstand higher temperatures?
[2023-05-29T15:16:27] Mirono escooters: Yes, I don't know wich tho
[2023-05-29T15:16:42] Simone: meanwhile I could drill the engine covers and add ferrofluid
[2023-05-29T15:16:58] Mirono escooters: Noooooooo
[2023-05-29T15:17:04] Mirono escooters: Just open cover and add ff üò≠
[2023-05-29T15:17:18] Mirono escooters: How are you riding 140 without ff? U got a temp sensor atleast?
[2023-05-29T15:17:21] Simone: does it make the situation worse?
[2023-05-29T15:17:35] Mirono escooters: If you like drilling..
[2023-05-29T15:18:13] Simone: I haven't put it on yet...
[2023-05-29T15:18:20] Mirono escooters: O
[2023-05-29T15:18:28] Mirono escooters: Open cover, and ferrofluid it
[2023-05-29T15:18:34] Simone: mix ferrofluid with dirt?
[2023-05-29T15:18:34] Luis Magalhaes: always use halls or fault
[2023-05-29T15:19:07] Simone: what would you do?
[2023-05-29T15:21:48] Mirono escooters: Open cover
[2023-05-29T15:22:18] Simone: Without ff?
[2023-05-29T15:46:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: To ride at 140 you need atleast 22kw constant. So around 11kw per motor constant. If the motors doesnt have enough cross section its all useless
[2023-05-29T15:46:20] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Atleast 10+mmq needed
[2023-05-29T15:47:26] Simone: I have awg10 üò≥
[2023-05-29T15:48:00] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Thats your answer why it overheats
[2023-05-29T15:48:23] Simone: Not for dimension of stator?
[2023-05-29T15:48:48] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Your amps goes through winding
[2023-05-29T15:49:27] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Or i dont understand what you mean, sry(
[2023-05-29T15:50:25] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You need both torque nm and good cross section
[2023-05-29T15:50:50] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: If you unbalanced it, you will lose at one of these
[2023-05-29T15:51:31] Simone: from what you wrote to me I understood that the problem of overheating is given by the cables...actually I thought that the fault was the small stator (I have 65mm)
[2023-05-29T15:54:43] Simone: I call stator the part where the winding is
[2023-05-29T15:54:50] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You do need bigger steel and bigger cross section. But you can increase in diameter of stator and rotor or in width by width of magnets and stator. Or mix it and increase both diameter and width + bigger cross section. You can ride on that speed at peak and ventilate rotor and stator by drilling holes, but you will not get constant system here
[2023-05-29T15:55:56] Simone: LY
[2023-05-29T15:56:16] Simone: 65H
[2023-05-29T15:58:54] Simone: I don't understand...
[2023-05-29T15:59:30] Simone: 65h is the stator height
[2023-05-29T15:59:57] Simone: diameter is standard or not?
[2023-05-29T16:04:01] Simone: I didn't know that...thanks for letting me know
[2023-05-29T16:05:10] Simone: I don't actually know the winding... when I bought them I asked the manufacturer based on the rpm it had to do at a certain voltage
[2023-05-29T16:05:24] Simone: today I opened one and there is the initials 33
[2023-05-29T16:08:03] Luis Magalhaes: i think not as they dont work with halls error
[2023-05-29T16:08:27] Simone: I checked the functioning from the monitor section of kelly's app
[2023-05-29T16:08:36] Luis Magalhaes: can check if they switch on app but if it does an error its not ok
[2023-05-29T16:08:41] Simone: you can see alternation 0/1
[2023-05-29T16:09:04] Simone: Yes
[2023-05-29T16:09:47] Simone: the strange thing is that during the rotation there are two sensors out of 1 and sometimes even three
[2023-05-29T16:11:44] Simone: <animation>
[2023-05-29T16:12:07] Unknown: Not enough space

[2023-05-29T16:13:42] Simone: from what I remember during the rotation of the engine by hand the state 0/1 alternated passing from the various halls A / B / C
[2023-05-29T16:14:34] Luis Magalhaes: 2 is ok i think 3 it gives you error
[2023-05-29T16:14:52] Luis Magalhaes: have a problem on one thats not switching every time
[2023-05-29T16:14:52] Simone: Example Hall A 1 Hall B 0 Hall C 0 Turn the motor and the state change to: Hall A 0 Hall B 1 Hall C 0
[2023-05-29T16:15:31] Simone: This is what I remember but maybe I'm wrong
[2023-05-29T16:16:05] Luis Magalhaes: i had a similar problem
[2023-05-29T16:16:43] Luis Magalhaes: i open the motor and with a magnet pass it in front of each hall sensor and see how it was changing to 1 or 0
[2023-05-29T16:17:02] Luis Magalhaes: and found one that did not change every time the magnet pass in front of him
[2023-05-29T16:17:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 120 degree 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 Etc

[2023-05-29T16:19:42] Simone: I try to fix an engine by changing the halls
[2023-05-29T16:19:54] Simone: if it works I'll move on to another one
[2023-05-29T16:21:10] Simone: thank you all for helping me, understand and discover new things for me
[2023-05-29T16:27:35] Simone: last question ... do you know what material is that silicone that put protection on the hall card?
[2023-05-29T16:27:58] Simone: <photos/photo_8564@29-05-2023_16-27-58.jpg>
[2023-05-29T16:42:02] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: White compound
[2023-05-29T16:44:09] Simone: Brand and model?
[2023-05-29T16:46:25] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Smth chinese
[2023-05-29T17:28:44] Konstantin: I heat my small motor 110¬∞~115¬∞, and 41f sensor... Chinese.... All ok;)
[2023-05-29T17:48:44] Simone: I remove a silicon protection on phase cable
[2023-05-29T17:48:56] Simone: And I found the surprise
[2023-05-29T17:49:06] Simone: <photos/photo_8565@29-05-2023_17-49-06.jpg>
[2023-05-29T17:50:25] Simone: I've already removed the halls and cleaned the pcb ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇüòÇ

[2023-05-29T18:01:00] Mirono escooters: Not
[2023-05-29T18:01:34] Simone: Drill the axle?
[2023-05-29T18:02:49] JPPL: Is a way
[2023-05-29T18:02:58] JPPL: Good friend did it
[2023-05-29T18:03:13] JPPL: But choose carefully the cables or they will cut themselves
[2023-05-29T18:03:28] JPPL: Heat yes,
[2023-05-29T18:03:42] JPPL: Are cables well ? Or to much curves?
[2023-05-29T18:04:14] JPPL: That's a 90¬∞ squeezed in arms
[2023-05-29T18:04:20] JPPL: Danger point
[2023-05-29T18:04:45] Simone: the only tight corner is coming out of the engine
[2023-05-29T18:06:03] JPPL: Where it happened right ? Check what can you doo
[2023-05-29T18:06:53] Simone: it's right in the corner just after the bearing
[2023-05-29T18:07:28] JPPL: There is change you put another spacer?
[2023-05-29T18:08:04] JPPL: On my 11x cables I was able to do it, cables come almost flat from motor and then large curve
[2023-05-29T18:08:39] JPPL: <photos/photo_8567@29-05-2023_18-08-39.jpg>
[2023-05-29T18:08:41] Simone: 3x4mm¬≤ currently pass through the axis
[2023-05-29T18:09:06] Simone: I had soldered some awg10 about 10cm from the cable outlet
[2023-05-29T18:09:18] Simone: I thought that was enough...but instead...
[2023-05-29T18:09:52] Simone: U have the motor with different case
[2023-05-29T18:10:17] Simone: they are already of origin with thicker cable
[2023-05-29T18:21:29] Simone: silicone cables are to be excluded...the insulation is too thick
[2023-05-29T18:21:36] Simone: advice?
[2023-05-29T18:23:43] Simone: what type of cable do you recommend?
[2023-05-29T18:24:55] JPPL: I really don't know, but study it well, must be good balance, maybe more mm2 around 5, and not too much cover
[2023-05-29T18:25:26] JPPL: Choose good flexibility but some of them a little metal touch and just open themselfes
[2023-05-29T18:25:30] JPPL: Watch out
[2023-05-29T18:25:42] JPPL: Wait for recommendations
[2023-05-29T18:27:11] Mirono escooters: Dont use silicon much waste
[2023-05-29T18:29:57] JPPL: True
[2023-05-29T18:31:00] Mirono escooters: How u even burrnrd dat
[2023-05-29T18:32:43] JPPL: Without main cable cover maybe he fits more
[2023-05-29T18:32:47] JPPL: Single cables
[2023-05-29T18:33:26] JPPL: Was front or back motor btw?
[2023-05-29T18:33:40] Mirono escooters: Dangerous tho
[2023-05-29T18:34:04] Simone: So far I've only opened the rear motor
[2023-05-29T18:34:09] JPPL: Already what we Doo üòÇ
[2023-05-29T18:34:39] JPPL: The best luck for you bro!

[2023-05-30T13:06:49] Jan: Looking at the 3 sausages that go into the motor, the answer is probably "yes"
[2023-05-30T13:07:45] Mirono escooters: How much amps Yes
[2023-05-30T13:22:45] Oreo huzky: üíÄ
[2023-05-30T14:27:09] JPPL: 300amp motor
[2023-05-30T14:27:11] JPPL: Max 550
[2023-05-30T14:28:21] JPPL: I'm using 130a battery but will go higher till 180+- , i think Is ok that amount of motor amps
[2023-05-30T14:28:52] JPPL: Less max will trigger over current for me
[2023-05-30T14:29:13] Martin Kaktits: Actually it worked out of the box with auto detect. Roger insisted to connecting and i allowed. Set up some field weakening and high speed shizk that i dont particularry care about right now. Nothing else, really. Oh, and made throttle all weird and jumpy. I saved backup and refreshed all, re-did auto setup - worked fine, worked good. Then it was finally time to put on tire and hit the road and it started to do weird shit. Then i started to investigate if i should try different firmwares and started to try and make sensoreless (VSS) work :)
[2023-05-30T14:31:08] Martin Kaktits: VSS, now that i tweaked and honed in on settings, works actually very good. I sometimes forget i dont even have halls connected :)

[2023-06-01T17:28:29] Unknown: For now because space
[2023-06-01T17:44:50] Unknown: The amp in the fw is it phase amps ?
[2023-06-01T17:59:46] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Both
[2023-06-01T18:01:15] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Additional power for shifting directive (second field) is not taken from nowhere. Everything is taken from the battery
[2023-06-01T18:09:07] Unknown: Yes but if my battery can only provide 30a ?
[2023-06-01T18:21:07] Ofek üê•: Set battery current to 30A, should work fine with 90A phase
[2023-06-01T18:39:31] Unknown: It's an 18a 48v battery
[2023-06-01T18:39:57] Unknown: Ahalan ofek
[2023-06-01T18:40:12] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 30A max current?
[2023-06-01T18:40:23] Unknown: I put an example
[2023-06-01T18:40:43] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Set battery current to 20A i.e and fw to 10A
[2023-06-01T18:40:52] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Look at rt data
[2023-06-01T18:40:59] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You need to never reach 30A then in total
[2023-06-01T18:41:23] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: If it goes higher - put your battery current or fw current down
[2023-06-01T18:41:32] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: And try again
[2023-06-01T18:42:08] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 30A battery is too low for speed and fw especially
[2023-06-01T18:47:02] Unknown: The battery I do tests on an 18/48 I don't know c rating/max current
[2023-06-01T18:48:02] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: The best analyze is to do it by yourself around your concrete system
[2023-06-01T18:48:51] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Just do tests and record rt data. Look at stats, change params, try again, look, change, try again, look etc
[2023-06-01T18:50:52] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Your maximum current for battery physically is when you have sag from 4.2v or 4.15v (max charge) to 3.6v per cell
[2023-06-01T18:51:29] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Its your limit there around battery, each cell, bms, wires etc. Ofc if bms is not cutting it and esc can take it
[2023-06-01T18:53:40] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Different cells have their own voltage sag from different current. You can see it from datasheet of a cell
[2023-06-01T18:54:40] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: If you do more than this, then you will produce a lot more heat per cell, degrade it and lose your battery very quickly in cycle life
[2023-06-01T19:01:14] Ofek üê•: Capacity doesn't matter if the battery can deliver the current.. I discharged 60A from 12s 5Ah lipo on my gf xiaomi..

[2023-06-01T19:05:09] Ofek üê•: I remove them from the scooter and charge on parallel, ain't nobody got time for soldering BMS üòÇ
[2023-06-01T19:05:44] Unknown: Is lipo more expensive? Then lithium ion
[2023-06-01T19:06:24] Ofek üê•: It depends on quality and performance, usually is a tradeoff
[2023-06-01T19:06:57] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Why not, if it high rate current discharge cells
[2023-06-01T19:07:04] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But be careful with lipo lol
[2023-06-01T19:07:51] Mirono escooters: Yea
[2023-06-01T19:07:58] Mirono escooters: I don't say it's bad I say low capacity

[2023-06-02T12:44:15] JPPL: Will be nice add for your setup, recommend it
[2023-06-02T12:54:22] NetworkDir: What's your battery voltage and discharge?
[2023-06-02T12:57:31] AK: You don't need it at all, its just another failure point
[2023-06-02T12:57:48] AK: No magic pcb is going to read and understand documentation for you
[2023-06-02T13:01:04] Unknown: It is easier for organizing wires
[2023-06-02T13:01:36] Unknown: Who sad I need it to read ?
[2023-06-02T13:01:44] AK: If you have two left hands and don't own a crimping tool, yeah
[2023-06-02T13:02:25] AK: Otherwise you crimp the cables you need into the connectors and that's it
[2023-06-02T13:06:18] Unknown: I don't have crimping tool I do need to buy one with a pack of JST? Connectors
[2023-06-02T13:07:14] Unknown: In the hall sensors I've soldered them to a normal hall connector
[2023-06-02T13:07:33] AK: Well, if you work around connectors a lot, it's a very well spent 20$ investment, an iwiss crimper from ali, and the correcponding ends
[2023-06-02T13:07:45] Unknown: Maybe something in the wires there came loose
[2023-06-02T13:08:37] Unknown: What is the name of those connectord ?
[2023-06-02T13:10:07] Unknown: <photos/photo_8587@02-06-2023_13-10-07.jpg>
[2023-06-02T13:10:24] Mirono escooters: Shitty one ;)
[2023-06-02T13:10:55] Unknown: Its matching the one on the motor side
[2023-06-02T13:11:19] Unknown: If I want to change it to what I'll change?
[2023-06-02T13:11:48] Mirono escooters: Jst or direct solder
[2023-06-02T13:11:58] Mirono escooters: There's a connector on the vesc, so why have another
[2023-06-02T14:21:15] Mirono escooters: How do you config bidirectional motor with 1 throttle?
[2023-06-02T14:21:26] Mirono escooters: I mean, a throttle that can go in - and + values Can vesc do that?
[2023-06-02T14:21:38] Mirono escooters: I wanna make a boat , with 1 lever forward and backward
[2023-06-02T14:21:56] AK: Yes, open adc tab, the help explains errything well
[2023-06-02T14:22:07] Mirono escooters: Bidirectional works? I haven't seen it
[2023-06-02T14:22:16] Mirono escooters: I looked for it, but on old vesc, should've updated
[2023-06-02T14:22:52] AK: It's not called bidirectional, that's why you didn't find it prop
[2023-06-02T14:22:56] Mirono escooters: Ah
[2023-06-02T14:22:59] Mirono escooters: My bad
[2023-06-02T14:24:24] AK: <photos/photo_8588@02-06-2023_14-24-24.jpg>
[2023-06-02T14:24:28] AK: That one you need
[2023-06-02T14:24:38] Mirono escooters: Ohh
[2023-06-02T14:24:39] Mirono escooters: Legend
[2023-06-02T14:24:45] Mirono escooters: I should've read it üòÇ
[2023-06-02T14:25:28] Mirono escooters: Output off means 0v? Right?
[2023-06-02T14:25:37] Mirono escooters: Or does half of 3.3 work tooü§î
[2023-06-02T14:26:55] AK: You really want me to be telegram-vesc-interface? :D
[2023-06-02T14:27:05] Mirono escooters: Yes , sorry
[2023-06-02T14:27:14] Mirono escooters: I have no vesc atm and I have to make it up for school/ draw it

[2023-06-02T14:27:46] AK: <photos/photo_8590@02-06-2023_14-27-46.jpg>
[2023-06-02T14:27:49] Mirono escooters: Sick you can set centerline with pc Phone habent seen
[2023-06-02T14:28:01] Mirono escooters: Top
[2023-06-02T14:28:58] Mirono escooters: Thanks alot ak, now I can go and draw
[2023-06-02T14:29:09] Mirono escooters: Easiest way is just hook up a lever to a throttle üòä
[2023-06-02T14:29:33] AK: Add a hall sensor to your lever
[2023-06-02T14:29:43] AK: Print magnet holder and hall sensor
[2023-06-02T14:30:07] Mirono escooters: Or that
[2023-06-02T14:30:11] Mirono escooters: Better idea problably
[2023-06-02T14:31:18] Mirono escooters: That or ppm from a rc controller, but this is more fun
[2023-06-02T17:53:00] rosheee: ^^ also depends what power loss he choose
[2023-06-02T17:53:18] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, exactly this
[2023-06-02T17:53:42] rosheee: how u get the most out of MTPA?
[2023-06-02T17:54:13] rosheee: also should u set the powerloss to what the motor "can"? if vsett 10+ motor then 1400W powerlos?
[2023-06-02T22:27:35] Martin Kaktits: Hey. So i noticed i can press both brake and throttle at the same time and throttle takes priority. As in, it will still drive wven when brake pressed. Which setting do i check so that brake takes priority?
[2023-06-02T22:31:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You have sensor or cut off atleast i guess
[2023-06-02T22:31:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Is e brake turned on at all?
[2023-06-02T22:32:52] Martin Kaktits: yeeye it works fine
[2023-06-02T22:33:12] Martin Kaktits: its adc1 adc2
[2023-06-02T22:34:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: ü§î
[2023-06-02T22:39:34] AK: You sure? It should not be like thaz
[2023-06-02T22:45:15] Martin Kaktits: ü§£always some weird shit with ne lol
[2023-06-03T03:40:34] rosheee: send logfiles
[2023-06-03T05:59:02] Ofek üê•: Happens for me too, but my brake is configured to cutoff without regen (inverted ADC2 with pullup resistor)
[2023-06-03T06:09:52] rosheee: @Her0DasH he special ^^'
[2023-06-03T09:21:15] rosheee: <video_file>

[2023-06-03T09:50:32] rosheee: XD
[2023-06-03T09:51:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You could login via server and check
[2023-06-03T09:51:37] rosheee: i did ^^
[2023-06-03T09:51:39] rosheee: but he change
[2023-06-03T09:52:02] rosheee: he will find a way that it works ^^
[2023-06-03T09:57:04] rosheee: atm it works üòÉ
[2023-06-03T10:20:37] Oreo huzky: Is there an vesc app for smart watch?
[2023-06-03T10:24:34] Oreo huzky: Could be a nice alternative for a dashboard to just look at smart watch to see info of vesc
[2023-06-03T10:52:15] rosheee: yas there was a project
[2023-06-03T10:52:20] rosheee: for apple watch
[2023-06-03T10:58:35] Oreo huzky: Oh nice do you have link
[2023-06-03T11:05:03] Oreo huzky: You mean xmatic right?
[2023-06-03T13:19:09] Konstantin: New, flipsky 75100 xD
[2023-06-03T13:19:17] Konstantin: Epoxy!!!!
[2023-06-03T13:24:28] Mirono escooters: Yes we already saw xD
[2023-06-03T13:24:34] Mirono escooters: Engineering
[2023-06-03T14:40:48] Mihail: Maybe it's conformal coating?
[2023-06-03T14:50:18] Mirono escooters: Doubt it
[2023-06-03T14:50:26] Mirono escooters: Janked together w epoxy
[2023-06-03T14:52:31] Mihail: I made a similar mistake on my controller, forgot to connect analog vcc on the mcu to 3.3V, they were lucky that there is a cap nearby. I had to put a wire and glue it to the board with solder mask. But it was for 5 boards only, strange how flipsky made a mistake on a large batch of controllers

[2023-06-03T17:16:54] Oreo huzky: Is it okay that I have washers there?
[2023-06-03T17:17:02] Mirono escooters: Why not
[2023-06-03T17:17:17] Oreo huzky: Idk seems a bit sketchy
[2023-06-03T17:22:26] Jan: You can some but dont over do it
[2023-06-03T17:22:41] Jan: Ive seen people with 100 washers
[2023-06-03T17:22:45] Jan: So unprofessional
[2023-06-03T17:23:00] Oreo huzky: Heh
[2023-06-03T17:23:04] Jan: They brakes are the last thing you want to see fail
[2023-06-03T17:23:25] Oreo huzky: I will still use e brake
[2023-06-03T17:23:49] Jan: E brake not powerful enough
[2023-06-03T17:23:56] Jan: For emergency
[2023-06-03T17:35:19] Oreo huzky: Didnt found other brakes sadly
[2023-06-03T17:35:32] Oreo huzky: Why?
[2023-06-03T17:36:21] Oreo huzky: Oof
[2023-06-03T17:37:42] rosheee: or buy correct adapter ^^
[2023-06-03T17:37:50] rosheee: buy correct adapter xD
[2023-06-03T17:38:56] Oreo huzky: I have but I need to file it down not enough space
[2023-06-03T17:39:40] Oreo huzky: Screws scratch on the holder
[2023-06-03T17:39:40] Oreo huzky: <photos/photo_8596@03-06-2023_17-39-40.jpg>
[2023-06-03T17:50:02] Ion: And then there is the ninebot ESx and unagi or whatever. Only e Brake. Always looked unsafe to me...
[2023-06-03T18:05:05] Oreo huzky: Most sketchy electric file
[2023-06-03T18:05:25] Mirono escooters: Wa de fok
[2023-06-03T18:05:38] Oreo huzky: Need to file the brake holder to fit
[2023-06-03T18:06:00] Oreo huzky: Here
[2023-06-03T18:06:21] Oreo huzky: It didn‚Äôt work well
[2023-06-03T18:07:14] Mirono escooters: More washers between mootor axle
[2023-06-03T18:08:02] Oreo huzky: Don‚Äôt have any for motor axle and if I did that the nut that holds the motor would only hold on to a little piece
[2023-06-03T18:08:59] Oreo huzky: <photos/photo_8597@03-06-2023_18-08-59.jpg>
[2023-06-03T18:09:08] Mirono escooters: Ah
[2023-06-03T18:11:00] Oreo huzky: Ye
[2023-06-03T18:11:10] Oreo huzky: Shitty situation
[2023-06-03T18:53:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: It isüôà
[2023-06-03T18:53:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: 1 is more than enought
[2023-06-03T18:56:30] Oreo huzky: No
[2023-06-03T18:56:44] Oreo huzky: I have torque washer on the outside
[2023-06-03T18:56:57] Oreo huzky: Isn‚Äôt that enough
[2023-06-03T18:57:05] Oreo huzky: Ooof
[2023-06-03T18:57:05] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: <sticker>
[2023-06-03T18:57:35] Oreo huzky: Motor won‚Äôt fit with washer in the inside
[2023-06-03T18:58:06] Oreo huzky: There is already a kind of washer
[2023-06-03T18:58:18] Oreo huzky: <photos/photo_8598@03-06-2023_18-58-18.jpg>
[2023-06-03T18:58:25] Oreo huzky: It‚Äôs from the motor
[2023-06-03T18:59:09] Oreo huzky: Let me try to get washer on
[2023-06-03T19:03:07] Oreo huzky: I will try
[2023-06-03T19:12:12] Oreo huzky: Can‚Äôt get it past that is that okay ?
[2023-06-03T19:15:03] Mirono escooters: Oof
[2023-06-03T19:15:59] Oreo huzky: Is that enough or do I need more ?
[2023-06-03T19:21:03] Mirono escooters: More
[2023-06-03T19:25:38] Oreo huzky: Will it break under load?
[2023-06-03T19:29:58] JPPL: Maybe get loose
[2023-06-03T19:30:04] JPPL: Really fast
[2023-06-03T19:31:08] Oreo huzky: Even if I tighten it really hard
[2023-06-03T19:32:31] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-06-03T19:32:35] Mirono escooters: Ull strip axle
[2023-06-03T19:35:26] Oreo huzky: Aw
[2023-06-03T19:35:30] Oreo huzky: Bruh
[2023-06-03T19:35:55] Oreo huzky: What if I put the washer on only one side?
[2023-06-03T19:39:39] JPPL: I have that motor too
[2023-06-03T19:40:09] JPPL: Without inside washer is possible I think
[2023-06-03T19:40:27] Oreo huzky: Nice
[2023-06-03T19:40:44] JPPL: I use washer on blade
[2023-06-03T19:40:45] Oreo huzky: How fast does it spin at 20s?
[2023-06-03T19:40:57] JPPL: But without you have good contact space
[2023-06-03T19:41:04] JPPL: Where cables come out
[2023-06-03T19:41:17] JPPL: 2100 rpm, this motor ia not for speed
[2023-06-03T19:41:25] Oreo huzky: <photos/photo_8601@03-06-2023_19-41-25.jpg>
[2023-06-03T19:41:33] JPPL: Even with Fieldweaking not the best performance
[2023-06-03T19:41:38] Oreo huzky: I‚Äôve noticed üòÇ
[2023-06-03T19:41:45] JPPL: They handle amazing amps if needed
[2023-06-03T19:42:10] Oreo huzky: No washer on the outside?
[2023-06-03T19:42:17] JPPL: As you can see on your image
[2023-06-03T19:42:27] JPPL: Inside washer is almost same size as motor output
[2023-06-03T19:42:42] JPPL: S√≥ teu to take it out, more outside space for the nut
[2023-06-03T19:43:04] Oreo huzky: And put torque washer inside?
[2023-06-03T19:43:49] JPPL: Personal choice I use outside, good locktite and is rocking
[2023-06-03T19:44:58] JPPL: Inside will be safer because rotation arm nuts will also have to be loosen to motor come out, with outsite washer only 1 nut need to loose to motor have a bigger change to come out
[2023-06-03T19:45:08] Oreo huzky: I don‚Äôt think that works for my dropout
[2023-06-03T19:45:09] Oreo huzky: <photos/photo_8603@03-06-2023_19-45-09.jpg>
[2023-06-03T19:45:28] JPPL: Opposite
[2023-06-03T19:45:40] JPPL: Need to put ginger on the arm hole
[2023-06-03T19:45:40] Oreo huzky: How did you not fuck up your dropout From torque
[2023-06-03T19:45:49] Oreo huzky: Ginger?
[2023-06-03T19:45:59] JPPL: Nothing of that rotates
[2023-06-03T19:46:05] JPPL: Finger
[2023-06-03T19:46:28] JPPL: <photos/photo_8604@03-06-2023_19-46-28.jpg>
[2023-06-03T19:46:39] JPPL: <photos/photo_8605@03-06-2023_19-46-39.jpg>
[2023-06-03T19:46:40] Oreo huzky: My front drop out is messed up even with torque washer
[2023-06-03T19:46:47] JPPL: <photos/photo_8606@03-06-2023_19-46-47.jpg>
[2023-06-03T19:46:56] JPPL: <photos/photo_8607@03-06-2023_19-46-56.jpg>
[2023-06-03T19:47:10] Oreo huzky: Ah That dosent work for me my dropout arm is to thick
[2023-06-03T19:47:26] JPPL: <photos/photo_8608@03-06-2023_19-47-26.jpg>
[2023-06-03T19:47:51] JPPL: You don't need the black inside
[2023-06-03T19:47:53] Oreo huzky: 350A phase
[2023-06-03T19:47:55] JPPL: Like mine
[2023-06-03T19:48:27] Oreo huzky: Yea but then the brake disc screws scratch on brake caliper holder
[2023-06-03T19:48:41] JPPL: Got it
[2023-06-03T19:48:53] Oreo huzky: Yea
[2023-06-03T19:48:58] JPPL: Is a balance I Know...üôà
[2023-06-03T19:49:21] JPPL: You are between the wall and knife üòÇ
[2023-06-03T19:49:22] Oreo huzky: That‚Äôs why I have been filing this mf for almost 3 hours
[2023-06-03T19:49:35] Oreo huzky: To make it slim
[2023-06-03T19:50:34] JPPL: Send pm with your brake support setup
[2023-06-03T19:50:43] JPPL: Too much offtopic
[2023-06-03T20:29:09] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Anyone got idea how I can get the motor cable through the axle easily... Spend already ages on it but they are so inflexible fucking impossible
[2023-06-03T20:29:57] Mirono escooters: Eat more spinach
[2023-06-03T20:30:12] Martin Kaktits: idk, use some heat
[2023-06-03T20:30:20] Martin Kaktits: make sure there is no silicone shizl holding it
[2023-06-03T20:33:33] sombre_enfant: Have less wire without the sleeve put grease pull with plier
[2023-06-03T20:35:00] sombre_enfant: Also you can tape the end of it with duct tape and fill it in
[2023-06-03T20:39:45] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: So cut off the phase cables and try in one part? That was the initial plan, but didn't go well either.
[2023-06-03T20:40:14] S1m 0n: It's sealed from inside
[2023-06-03T20:40:41] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I took the cable out and removed the silicone.
[2023-06-03T20:40:47] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: My plan is to put it back in.
[2023-06-03T20:41:29] S1m 0n: Oh
[2023-06-03T20:42:47] S1m 0n: Grease or PTFE spray. At the end of the phases a (flower) wire un to pull them into position
[2023-06-03T21:03:57] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It drives me crazy on how hard it is to get it through.

[2023-06-03T21:10:15] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Now it's a piece of garbage

[2023-06-03T21:11:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: that's why they look so stripped
[2023-06-03T21:11:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: got me two wires to pull to pull the rest through but man no chance
[2023-06-03T21:16:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Nope pulled so hard on it now that my pull wires broke in half üòê no idea how they got that wire through the hole

[2023-06-03T21:33:48] S1m 0n: And make the phase straight, without waves. Hold at the tip with pliers and pull once hard
[2023-06-03T22:01:43] JPPL: Soap
[2023-06-03T22:07:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It just feels like the opening at the bottom is too small for the cable. It doesn't seem to fit through... üòê Chinese factory fucking magicians

[2023-06-04T02:41:21] Oreo huzky: So I basically destroyed the rgb without using it once I plugged it into normal rgb driver

[2023-06-04T08:42:04] Thierry: I did it on 60H, I think the same as yours. It took me time to finally find the less worst solution. It is tricky bit I first removed the circlip and extracted the axle from the "metal slices"
[2023-06-04T08:43:53] Thierry: Then I inserted the cable. If Iyou let the axle inside then no chance to bend it.
[2023-06-04T08:44:26] Thierry: You need a press to gently remove and reinstall it.
[2023-06-04T08:46:58] Thierry: To install it on the rotor, again it is tricky. Axle and cable cannot pass through the bearing. They recommand to hit the cable on axle with plastic hammer. Personally do not rexomand this solution üòÖ
[2023-06-04T10:48:38] Mirono escooters: Axle isn't pressed in?
[2023-06-04T11:47:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Fits over it ,just tight like shit, also if you have that spring protection,pull it up that cant be there that time
[2023-06-04T11:49:11] Thierry: Yes it is pressed but nor crimped. It is necessary to use a press. Don't hit with hammer or something else. And use spacer to apply the pressure on right place. There is a risk to damage the layers.
[2023-06-04T11:49:50] Thierry: I just pressed ro remove few cm to pass the cable
[2023-06-04T14:36:25] Ion: Cool feature. The ADC Adapter V2 can control the brake light based on ADC brake input. No need for brake switches on the levers

[2023-06-06T16:28:10] JPPL: Yes
[2023-06-06T16:28:17] JPPL: Back ctrl flipsky
[2023-06-06T16:28:34] JPPL: All MOSFETs gone
[2023-06-06T16:29:41] JPPL: <photos/photo_8629@06-06-2023_16-29-41.jpg>
[2023-06-06T16:29:46] JPPL: One side
[2023-06-06T16:31:15] Mirono escooters: MOSFET shorted
[2023-06-06T16:32:12] JPPL: Then influence BMS after they short?
[2023-06-06T16:32:23] JPPL: Maybe some MOSFETs from bms
[2023-06-06T16:32:32] Mirono escooters: Possible
[2023-06-06T16:32:35] Mirono escooters: Or a perma short somewhere
[2023-06-06T16:32:58] JPPL: Everything is disconnected
[2023-06-06T16:36:23] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: If bms hard cut then ofc esc will burn in a msec
[2023-06-06T16:36:49] Mirono escooters: Isn't usb supposed to be Rx tx?
[2023-06-06T16:36:52] Mirono escooters: Problably dumb but
[2023-06-06T16:38:02] Oliver Eliasson: How high can i put zero vector frequency? It helps motor temps? I changed to ortega original, what should the one above be?
[2023-06-06T16:38:21] Mirono escooters: Motor temps better Esc temps worse
[2023-06-06T16:41:21] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Stay around 25-30kHz zv freq. Its ok
[2023-06-06T16:44:28] Oliver Eliasson: Even if esc is fine, i have 8.5‚Äù motors that reach 70c quick with have riding. Esc is almost always under 40 and i think i have never seen it above 50
[2023-06-06T17:08:49] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You can rise up to 35khz (17.5kHz pwm). Will reduce motor heat a bit, but heat up fets a little
[2023-06-06T17:09:03] Unknown: This is concerning
[2023-06-06T17:09:28] Mirono escooters: How much power even?
[2023-06-06T17:09:29] Unknown: Is the firmware has something to do with this?
[2023-06-06T17:11:05] Finn: I got a new makerbase 75100. Is that right?
[2023-06-06T17:12:02] Unknown: The guy @XgunaX had that firmware I think
[2023-06-06T17:34:31] JPPL: True
[2023-06-06T17:34:38] JPPL: I use that
[2023-06-06T17:35:09] JPPL: I was pushing 300a motor with max 600 i think and 150a battery
[2023-06-06T17:35:11] JPPL: 20s
[2023-06-06T17:35:27] Mirono escooters: XD what the
[2023-06-06T17:35:29] Mirono escooters: Max 600??
[2023-06-06T17:35:32] Mirono escooters: No wonder it boom
[2023-06-06T17:36:01] JPPL: üòÇüòú
[2023-06-06T17:36:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yeah
[2023-06-06T17:38:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: He needs 3shul
[2023-06-06T17:38:35] JPPL: What would be your max absolut motor phase? On 75200
[2023-06-06T17:39:15] rosheee: I wanted hope tech from u
[2023-06-06T17:39:36] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Max absolute is fault error limit
[2023-06-06T17:39:38] rosheee: But u not wanna sell..so i found one for 200chf xD
[2023-06-06T17:40:18] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: So if there were 400+ phase peaks because you set 600 abs then yes
[2023-06-06T17:40:24] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: It can burn like that
[2023-06-06T17:41:02] JPPL: Thanks ;)
[2023-06-06T17:41:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: For both he mean
[2023-06-06T17:41:33] JPPL: No üòÇ
[2023-06-06T17:41:39] JPPL: One
[2023-06-06T17:42:03] JPPL: <photos/photo_8633@06-06-2023_17-42-03.jpg>
[2023-06-06T17:42:44] JPPL: 300 max current motor, then 600 absolut max
[2023-06-06T17:42:53] JPPL: üòù
[2023-06-06T17:44:03] JPPL: <video_file>
[2023-06-06T17:44:03] JPPL: <video_file>
[2023-06-06T17:45:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Both or rear?
[2023-06-06T17:45:21] JPPL: Each 300
[2023-06-06T17:45:47] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: So it looks like it peaks at 350-370A each
[2023-06-06T17:46:11] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: High current sampling was on?
[2023-06-06T17:46:17] JPPL: Yeah, yes
[2023-06-06T17:46:23] JPPL: Mtpa also
[2023-06-06T17:46:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Oh shit
[2023-06-06T17:46:37] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: So thats the reason too
[2023-06-06T17:46:44] JPPL: Tell me more
[2023-06-06T17:47:13] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Mtpa needs very strong esc
[2023-06-06T17:47:24] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: And its for ipm primarly
[2023-06-06T17:47:37] JPPL: Got it
[2023-06-06T17:47:50] JPPL: And about hight current sampling
[2023-06-06T17:48:05] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Look at info tab, it rises current also
[2023-06-06T17:48:08] Mirono escooters: @jamessoderstrom looooves mtpa lol
[2023-06-06T17:48:30] JPPL: S√≥ cl350 handle all of this?
[2023-06-06T17:48:44] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 20s? Get c350. Its rds lower
[2023-06-06T17:48:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: Lol, then how explain that I‚Äôve 75200 with it and field weakening also üòÇ
[2023-06-06T17:49:09] JPPL: Also Fieldweaking
[2023-06-06T17:49:12] JPPL: 80a
[2023-06-06T17:49:14] JPPL: üòÇ
[2023-06-06T17:49:14] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Mad ahah
[2023-06-06T17:49:16] JPPL: All on
[2023-06-06T17:49:19] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Wtf
[2023-06-06T17:49:22] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Lol
[2023-06-06T17:49:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: 600A abs maximum with 300A motor means you concern errors so no protection at all for currents
[2023-06-06T17:49:37] Mirono escooters: Were you on a Speedrun to kill a vesc or what
[2023-06-06T17:49:48] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Portal gun
[2023-06-06T17:49:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, but 28kW maximum , not 32 like him
[2023-06-06T17:50:01] JPPL: Pushing my limits üòÖ
[2023-06-06T17:50:07] Mirono escooters: Shame for esc
[2023-06-06T17:50:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: And 660A peak
[2023-06-06T17:50:13] Mirono escooters: Maybe repairable, if worth Time
[2023-06-06T17:50:18] Mirono escooters: I got my new MOSFETs to repair 75200
[2023-06-06T17:50:36] JPPL: Naahh, bought already
[2023-06-06T17:50:48] JPPL: Saw makerx vs cl350
[2023-06-06T17:51:04] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 3shul all the way
[2023-06-06T17:51:17] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But use c350 for lower voltages
[2023-06-06T17:51:19] JPPL: <photos/photo_8634@06-06-2023_17-51-19.jpg>
[2023-06-06T17:51:31] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Or if you want to upgrade to 22s+ later then ofc cl350
[2023-06-06T17:51:31] Mirono escooters: I'm makerx fan
[2023-06-06T17:51:56] JPPL: 22 or 24 is possible as I have that battery mods
[2023-06-06T17:52:04] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ye, cl350 then
[2023-06-06T17:52:10] JPPL: Cl better choice, but I like makerx too
[2023-06-06T17:52:19] JPPL: Thanks for info
[2023-06-06T17:55:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: It will be worse than flipsky , much more worse on temperatures
[2023-06-06T17:56:09] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Did you burn your also? i forgot sry
[2023-06-06T17:56:51] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 3shul and makerx is like sky and ground in performance
[2023-06-06T17:59:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: No , never hahaha
[2023-06-06T17:59:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: 75200 no
[2023-06-06T17:59:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: 75100 yea
[2023-06-06T17:59:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: 6 times 75100 to220 version and 2 the alu pcb
[2023-06-06T18:00:34] JPPL: Really? Such big difference?
[2023-06-06T18:00:55] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You can talk with mr @SibClimb about it
[2023-06-06T18:01:04] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: He knows very well 3shul escs
[2023-06-06T18:01:17] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Also i do like it more
[2023-06-06T18:01:57] JPPL: If you 2 recommend, i know I will not be dissapointed
[2023-06-06T18:02:05] JPPL: Cl700 is a beast
[2023-06-06T18:02:11] JPPL: üò≠
[2023-06-06T18:02:35] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, you can install it for rear only, but dimensions ehh
[2023-06-06T18:17:10] Finn: <photos/photo_8635@06-06-2023_18-17-10.jpg>

[2023-06-06T18:17:15] Finn: 345A
[2023-06-06T18:17:23] Finn: And my processor is getting a little hot
[2023-06-06T18:23:34] Mirono escooters: U mean f405?
[2023-06-06T18:23:45] Mirono escooters: Lol, R totally wrong
[2023-06-06T18:23:48] Mirono escooters: Wich vesc wich fw
[2023-06-06T18:23:56] Mirono escooters: Motor flux linkage also wrong
[2023-06-06T18:25:22] Finn: Idk
[2023-06-06T18:25:25] Finn: My controller cooks
[2023-06-06T18:28:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: Normal, always happen with 75100
[2023-06-06T18:28:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: I can show you 2 different ones completely burnt üò¢
[2023-06-06T18:28:52] Mirono escooters: How
[2023-06-06T18:29:09] Finn: What you mean
[2023-06-06T18:29:28] Finn: i got an 75100 non alu and flashed it with 75100v2 firmware no limits
[2023-06-06T18:29:41] Finn: i tried now the normal without the v2
[2023-06-06T18:29:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: too big for an escooter honestly
[2023-06-06T18:30:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: Don't know, normal use on surron, 450A phase, 300A battery, took fire, it's still outside of our workshop, happened last week
[2023-06-06T18:30:42] Mirono escooters: Lol mp2 beat makerx
[2023-06-06T18:30:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: weird, I got 2.2mOhm on Rage Mechanics Surron Custom motor, and trust me, it's a huge powerful motor x)
[2023-06-06T18:30:49] Mirono escooters: I have heard good stuff about them, so I'm confuse
[2023-06-06T18:30:56] Face de Pin Suc√©: I'm confuse too
[2023-06-06T18:31:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: Time for suce pack
[2023-06-06T18:31:13] Mirono escooters: Bad batch?
[2023-06-06T18:31:33] Finn: bro my fucking pcb is desoldering itself if this continues
[2023-06-06T18:31:45] Mirono escooters: üòê wtf
[2023-06-06T18:31:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: Twice in few months, can't be
[2023-06-06T18:32:24] Face de Pin Suc√©: <video_file>
[2023-06-06T18:32:34] Finn: the stock firmware said it was an 75300
[2023-06-06T18:32:42] Finn: now it changed bc i flasehd 75100
[2023-06-06T18:32:47] Mirono escooters: Thats cooked xd
[2023-06-06T18:32:54] Mirono escooters: ... based on
[2023-06-06T18:32:58] Mirono escooters: Its always like that
[2023-06-06T18:33:07] Finn: so should i flash 75300?
[2023-06-06T18:33:12] Mirono escooters: NoüòÇ
[2023-06-06T18:33:17] Mirono escooters: Correct fw

[2023-06-06T18:34:30] Finn: Okay its dead
[2023-06-06T18:34:33] Face de Pin Suc√©: @XgunaX here you can see how big is C700
[2023-06-06T18:34:57] JPPL: Yes no sense
[2023-06-06T18:35:04] Face de Pin Suc√©: C/CL350 is good
[2023-06-06T18:35:26] JPPL: Cl350 maybe is my future choice
[2023-06-06T18:35:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: but if you wait for C500 (available in 1-2months I guess) will be interesting too, almost same size as C350 but 500A phase capable ;)
[2023-06-06T18:36:00] JPPL: Hummmm üòç
[2023-06-06T18:36:19] JPPL: But for fireworks? üòú
[2023-06-06T18:36:42] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Great
[2023-06-06T18:40:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: CL500 too?
[2023-06-06T18:49:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: Hahaha
[2023-06-06T18:49:38] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, both coming together at same time
[2023-06-06T18:55:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: 18mos I guess right?
[2023-06-06T18:56:11] Face de Pin Suc√©: You guess wonderfully right
[2023-06-06T18:57:20] Mirono escooters: Toll?
[2023-06-06T18:57:29] Face de Pin Suc√©: Of course
[2023-06-06T18:57:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: IMS
[2023-06-06T19:02:07] Ion: Sorry to bother but i thought the number in VESC always referred to battery amps? Like 75100 is 100A battery, no?
[2023-06-06T19:07:42] Mirono escooters: Manufacturers stopped following it long ago
[2023-06-06T19:11:31] Finn: Anyone got experience with ali express and the return policy
[2023-06-06T19:11:42] Finn: Makerbase got 15days free return
[2023-06-06T19:14:55] Mirono escooters: Ye
[2023-06-06T19:14:59] Mirono escooters: Works well
[2023-06-06T19:17:17] Finn: @Mirono_escooters shoud i just give them the broken one and say i dont need it?üòÇ
[2023-06-06T19:23:17] Mirono escooters: I don't motivate scamming
[2023-06-06T19:28:17] Finn: I am trying it
[2023-06-06T19:28:30] Finn: Hopefully they doesnt check
[2023-06-06T19:34:39] Konstantin: Has new power board, logic board die;) Chinese epoxy, hard to fix ;))
[2023-06-06T19:36:52] Mirono escooters: Wich
[2023-06-06T19:37:05] Konstantin: And 1 man, which I was installed 75200 pushing 350a phase. Only MOSFETs blow at 180a recuperation xDDD...at full battery... Now I set if battery >90v, available only 5% of recommendation power
[2023-06-06T19:37:32] Mirono escooters: When repairing a toll damaged vesc, just replace all 4 on the phase? ( 12 fet Esc)
[2023-06-06T19:37:59] Konstantin: Absolutely new ;)
[2023-06-06T19:41:43] Konstantin: Interesting to teardown new 75350 ... It's 18 or 24 fets inside...
[2023-06-06T19:42:16] Mirono escooters: You have so much toys üòÇ I'm jealous
[2023-06-06T20:01:20] Finn: This shit is insane
[2023-06-06T20:05:44] Mirono escooters: Waste
[2023-06-06T20:24:09] Finn: I knowüò≠
[2023-06-06T20:26:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: It depends of manufacturer

[2023-06-06T20:33:14] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Oh.. old flipsky pcb and 12" hub. Thats definitely wrong choice
[2023-06-06T20:38:40] Martin Kaktits: Hey. So im trying out observers and i noticed significant incresse in low speed torque (running VSS) with mxlemming, BUT more top speed with Ortega original ü•≤ wut. How can i get both
[2023-06-06T20:39:00] Martin Kaktits: its tronic 250 + vsett motor
[2023-06-06T20:41:14] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Use fw with mxlemming or ortega with a little more phase amps. Or rise up voltage then use mxlemming, rpms will come with voltage
[2023-06-06T20:42:33] Martin Kaktits: but efficiency ü•≤
[2023-06-06T20:48:26] Martin Kaktits: what are reasonble FW amps?
[2023-06-06T20:50:18] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Try 20A and start from 85-90% duty
[2023-06-06T20:50:29] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But whats speed without it?
[2023-06-06T20:51:16] Martin Kaktits: 57ish with mxlemming and 62ish wirh ortega
[2023-06-06T20:51:39] Oreo huzky: The disappointment in his voice
[2023-06-06T20:54:11] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Thats not fast enough, ok, then try as i said
[2023-06-06T20:54:21] Martin Kaktits: xD
[2023-06-06T20:54:46] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I mean to reach 65kmh i.e you dont need so much power
[2023-06-06T20:57:08] Martin Kaktits: FW mxlemming catches up to Ortega
[2023-06-06T21:08:19] Konstantin: Phase filters xD
[2023-06-06T21:08:42] Happy Giraffe: And put small delay on it like 0.5 sec
[2023-06-06T21:12:22] Martin Kaktits: thos ramp time?
[2023-06-06T21:12:42] Martin Kaktits: why
[2023-06-06T21:13:54] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: To have a little headroom of torque without fw while accelerating and then it starts after ramp time
[2023-06-06T21:15:43] Martin Kaktits: oki doki
[2023-06-07T00:10:28] Valentin Holl√§nder: Do anyone know what the problem is? When i press the power button the vesc dont power on.. but if i hold down the power button the vesc power on for 2 sec and the motor starts to spin :/
[2023-06-07T00:10:47] Valentin Holl√§nder: <video_file>
[2023-06-07T00:11:20] Valentin Holl√§nder: This video is when i hold down the power button
[2023-06-07T00:50:32] Valentin Holl√§nder: Cant connect to it becuse its need to be powered on to connect?
[2023-06-07T00:51:03] JPPL: True, disconnect everything else before powering up
[2023-06-07T00:51:13] JPPL: Only leave Bluetooth
[2023-06-07T00:53:06] Valentin Holl√§nder: Same problem tested before
[2023-06-07T00:53:23] Valentin Holl√§nder: Cant i reset the vesc or something without power?
[2023-06-07T05:32:23] Happy Giraffe: Ye, it smoothens it out. Otherwise could cause issues I heard
[2023-06-07T10:32:29] Martin Kaktits: Ok, so I also tried MTPA on and FW off and i also reach about the same Ortega speed.
[2023-06-07T10:33:12] Martin Kaktits: this with FW AND MTPA, i stopped early, it felt like it could go more üòÉ but the power draw at those speeds jeesh

[2023-06-07T17:20:09] rosheee: fucking motors üòÜ so 33x2 is to high kv never torque and should run hot AF? 22x3 should be ok and ppl say also high kv
[2023-06-07T17:23:32] Face de Pin Suc√©: 10/11inch 14-22S battery 22x3 is standard KV 16X4 is high torque 33x2 is high speed
[2023-06-07T17:24:34] rosheee: but 33x2 shit?
[2023-06-07T17:24:39] rosheee: much heat
[2023-06-07T17:24:53] rosheee: 22x3 burnout and never grip
[2023-06-07T17:25:06] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: No, cross section compensates
[2023-06-07T17:25:12] rosheee: XD
[2023-06-07T17:25:21] Face de Pin Suc√©: depends of your setup
[2023-06-07T17:25:31] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Less torque - yes. Need mor amps
[2023-06-07T17:25:33] rosheee: 20s6P 250-300a CONT
[2023-06-07T17:25:35] rosheee: BATTERY
[2023-06-07T17:25:42] rosheee: so 125-150A per motor
[2023-06-07T17:25:55] rosheee: rear motor maybe 170 battery
[2023-06-07T17:26:44] rosheee: 250A phase cont.

[2023-06-07T17:27:49] rosheee: XD
[2023-06-07T17:27:54] rosheee: this just max
[2023-06-07T17:27:59] rosheee: that what we use atm for 22x3
[2023-06-07T17:28:04] rosheee: 60h
[2023-06-07T17:28:07] Face de Pin Suc√©: under 250A phase, 33x2 is not torque enough
[2023-06-07T17:28:08] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: If peak, then its ok for seconds
[2023-06-07T17:28:12] Face de Pin Suc√©: but it depends of people also
[2023-06-07T17:28:18] rosheee: omg

[2023-06-07T17:28:27] rosheee: so better go 22x3
[2023-06-07T17:28:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Need atleast 350a
[2023-06-07T17:28:32] rosheee: with 10"?
[2023-06-07T17:28:46] Happy Giraffe: If you got ton of amps available and dont care about efficiency then high kv always better
[2023-06-07T17:28:54] Happy Giraffe: The high torque lasts longer
[2023-06-07T17:28:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: no, 250A works, but, it's a little not enough
[2023-06-07T17:28:55] rosheee: <sticker>

[2023-06-08T19:55:38] Jan: There is no good way to install a cube
[2023-06-08T19:55:49] Jan: 15-25mm height max

[2023-06-08T19:57:55] Jan: Yes very much
[2023-06-08T19:58:05] Jan: But no release date, feels like fucking Star Citizen
[2023-06-08T20:43:49] AK: I disagree entirely

[2023-06-08T20:45:24] AK: I mean, you have all the unused height in the deck, what are you gon do with it
[2023-06-08T20:45:32] Jan: My argument is heat dissipation
[2023-06-08T20:45:33] AK: Feels so wasteful, the long ones
[2023-06-08T20:45:39] Mirono escooters: Most civil discussion
[2023-06-08T20:46:02] AK: Power stage should be on bottom with alu pcb, errything else stacked on top
[2023-06-08T20:46:03] Mirono escooters: I see advantage for cube, and disadvantage In Xiaomi you defenitely want cube
[2023-06-08T20:46:03] Mirono escooters: Mp2 can have flat caps and upright, wich is cool And add more caps if want cube
[2023-06-08T20:46:17] Jan: Agree
[2023-06-08T20:47:01] Jan: When you get 70mm battery cells you dont want a 100mm cube on the bottom
[2023-06-08T20:47:25] AK: My dream would be something like 100v100a ubox, but in non - retarded execution
[2023-06-08T20:47:30] Jan: More area is always easier to dissipate heat
[2023-06-08T20:48:56] AK: It's sort of okay even as it is, but if done properly would be amazing
[2023-06-08T21:05:07] Face de Pin Suc√©: CL700 is for ebikes, not scooters
[2023-06-08T21:09:33] Ion: Also, when will the V2 spinY be released? Anyone know?
[2023-06-08T21:10:11] JPPL: Do you get used to spiny? I tested for while but prefer classic thumb mod
[2023-06-08T21:10:51] Jan: Amy did not answer me yet what happens to Series 1 customers
[2023-06-08T21:10:57] Jan: But Artem gave an update 4 days ago
[2023-06-08T21:11:43] Jan: " hi people will post today an update - it is fully CNCed and assembly is going as we speak! ‚ù§Ô∏è - shipping will start this weak - web page will be update for Spin-Y2 also this weak (Spintend.com) ‚Ä¢ about cruise. Once you have ebrake connected, you will get used to braking with ebrake and apply mechanical only later when ebrake is not enough any more. (I use it on 800w scooter in city as a way to slow down, and than when release the lever controller goes back up to the cruise speed üëå - so it can be a useful feature but yeah throttle can‚Äôt know when you operate mechanical break lever) ‚Ä¢ cruise can be disabled in 3 ways 1. Accelerating alot more than cruise speed set 2. Scrolling back to ebrake 3. Tapping the CC button again I will work on v3 and will include ‚Äúebrake recognition feature‚Äù on next PCB revision. It is difficult but possible to archive with no extra wires in theory Thanks for review I‚Äôm glad that cruise feature is the only further improvement you found it needs - I agree with you, I also don‚Äôt see any other changes for next version that my be needed so farüëå more colors ? üòÅüëç Btw as per your advice we will lower minimal speed value by 66% so that it can be engaged even at 5kmh on such high power scooter like Nami" @artBula
[2023-06-08T21:12:18] Mirono escooters: Where is Artem
[2023-06-08T21:12:21] Mirono escooters: He silent
[2023-06-08T21:12:40] Jan: I have the Rion Curve 50/50, its really nice but would prefer 70/30

[2023-06-09T03:38:29] Jedich Nixan: Hey Guys. I'm getting in the next few Days a Blade Motor 800w for my G30DII. My goal is to get maximum Torque, but no risking any Damage. Speed isn't that important. If I hit 60 or 70km/h would be absolutely ok for me. What Battery would you recommend? My Idea is a 17S5P which equals about 72v. What Cells would you prefer for this Goal? There are many ppl who build Battery's with Samsung 50G or Molicel P42A. An Another guy says Samsung 50S or Molicel P42B would be better.
[2023-06-09T03:39:53] Jedich Nixan: If any German ppl are here, I would appreciate it when they pm me. Bc my engl isn't good enough for this kinda stuff. üòï
[2023-06-09T03:41:52] Jedich Nixan: Another Plan is to get 2WD. Can I hook 2 Flipsky 75100 Ctr together?
[2023-06-09T03:51:46] rosheee: u got max torque motor
[2023-06-09T03:57:17] Jedich Nixan: Yeah, but the question how much Amps can I push to this Blade Motor with 800w?
[2023-06-09T03:58:18] Jedich Nixan: Nope, I just got my own...which is ATM with Stock Hardware.
[2023-06-09T06:50:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 16S4P 40T 100A is enough to reach 60+ w/ field weakening 68km/h on this exact motor. My friend is driving with this setup, barely consuming over 50A battery and 90-100A motor current, it won't really go further than 100A motor current without struggling.
[2023-06-09T06:52:01] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes you can.
[2023-06-09T06:52:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Too late.
[2023-06-09T06:55:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Anyway you can text him yourself @AndyM365 if you have further questions. @DedsecEnzo uses the motor as well.
[2023-06-09T06:56:50] Jedich Nixan: Is there a diagram how to hook up those 2 Ctrs?
[2023-06-09T06:57:14] Jedich Nixan: Thx buddy
[2023-06-09T19:05:14] D J: 3shul controllers also need an adapter for the ADC input to not have voltage higher than 3.3v?
[2023-06-09T19:08:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you connect the throttle to 3.3v you can‚Äôt get voltage higher than 3.3, I still never understand why people need adc adapter
[2023-06-09T19:09:25] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I think its because of some faults on very earlier versions of ubox
[2023-06-09T19:10:46] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: And something else I noticed that the adc adapter eliminates interference if the long cable is from the handles
[2023-06-09T19:11:55] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Without it, the wires pick up a lot of interference. I used a shielded cable for this lol when dont use adc adapter
[2023-06-09T19:13:17] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Adc adapter should be as close as possible to esc
[2023-06-09T19:39:44] Luis Magalhaes: My throtlle did not output power with 3.3v it has to have 5v to work, i did the resistor mod to reduce voltage at the output before conecting to the vesc (when i was using ubox)
[2023-06-09T19:40:22] Luis Magalhaes: It should be easy to just buy a new 3.3v throtlle but..üòÇ
[2023-06-09T19:44:30] JPPL: Spinted box all setups ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2023-06-09T19:45:26] AK: It's not a mod, it's best practice, using a 5v throttle with a resistor divider
[2023-06-09T19:46:03] AK: In case of hall failure you will get voltage outside of usual operation parameters, 3.2 instead of 3.0 for example, and can react to that
[2023-06-09T20:10:13] Luis Magalhaes: Yes but in my case it output 5v and i reduced to 3.3v because that throtlle wont work with less the 5v+-

[2023-06-09T21:04:16] Luis Magalhaes: Similar to the xiaomi
[2023-06-09T21:04:32] Luis Magalhaes: It broke and i put this one after
[2023-06-09T21:08:45] Konstantin: Somebody use adc sprinted adapter? When I apply 5v it loop bibps? Or not...
[2023-06-09T22:39:44] Konstantin: It's ok or it's broken?
[2023-06-09T23:00:04] Ion: I guess you should connect it to your VESC?
[2023-06-09T23:13:13] rosheee: maybe because no grnd?
[2023-06-09T23:38:21] Mike: Hi. Is there a way to save the total km route in the controller, in the Vesc app?
[2023-06-09T23:38:48] Konstantin: Same... 2 LEDs... It's not new, and after few hands...
[2023-06-09T23:39:39] Konstantin: And bip...bip... sounds like rip xD
[2023-06-09T23:40:05] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: No, it shouldnt
[2023-06-09T23:40:11] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I use it
[2023-06-10T00:41:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think it works with spintend only, need special firmware maybe
[2023-06-10T00:49:33] Konstantin: Not sure about it... It's uart communication... And sprinted use standard uart from vesc
[2023-06-10T01:03:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: So idk, I never liked light etc on a escooyer, I take care only about power
[2023-06-10T01:03:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Tested 200A motor current on single 60H today, it's uh very fun üòÇ But didn't trust to go further than 90km/h on it without gear.
[2023-06-10T01:03:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <video_file>
[2023-06-10T01:04:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: This mp2?
[2023-06-10T01:04:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes.
[2023-06-10T01:05:00] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Also temps I need to put better thermal pads and ran out of thermal paste üòÇ
[2023-06-10T01:05:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It's surprising that it even stays cool enough to not blow up.
[2023-06-10T01:05:40] Finn: What about your motorüòÅ
[2023-06-10T01:05:40] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Tomorrow I take some time to do it better.
[2023-06-10T01:05:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: don't know, pray and hope it doesn't smoke üíÄ
[2023-06-10T01:06:32] Finn: Motor gonna get hotter then the sun
[2023-06-10T01:07:33] Finn: Phase Cables gonna vaporize
[2023-06-10T01:09:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because temperature ramp speed is same as my flipsky 75100, but yeah maybe you didn‚Äôt good cooling
[2023-06-10T01:09:55] Finn: Watercooling incomming
[2023-06-10T01:10:07] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yup I used the cheapest thermal and thiccest pads on the earth
[2023-06-10T01:19:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes it has, but I forgot to solder sensor pad (I think). Need to fix tomorrow but but have to take it apart again xd
[2023-06-10T01:20:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: nah nah I mean ESC
[2023-06-10T01:21:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but motor I don't know, when cable is cut it's easy to push out and take apart...
[2023-06-10T01:21:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but with cable nah no idea
[2023-06-10T01:21:30] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: welllll
[2023-06-10T01:21:38] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: it's bad
[2023-06-10T01:21:52] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: The solder pad is below the PCB
[2023-06-10T01:22:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: also need to change voltage dividers
[2023-06-10T01:22:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: cuz 22S will trigger hardware overvoltage protection
[2023-06-10T01:22:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: brk
[2023-06-10T01:23:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It's a special feature of this ESC

[2023-06-10T01:24:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: Me too testing toys on wolf
[2023-06-10T01:26:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: Nobody believes the performance
[2023-06-10T01:27:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs enough to know üòÇ
[2023-06-10T01:27:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: 400A through 2 x to220
[2023-06-10T01:32:55] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Probably phase current and legs can handle half of it a little for sure
[2023-06-10T01:33:26] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Because of impulses work as motor rotates
[2023-06-10T01:36:03] rosheee: Tronic with infineon fuckeria mosfet > flipsky
[2023-06-10T01:36:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: Specially soldered
[2023-06-10T01:37:28] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: MP2 > everything
[2023-06-10T01:37:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but it's so much work to get a unit running üòî

[2023-06-10T01:48:42] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Toll has pulse 1000+A and very big package limit
[2023-06-10T01:48:56] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: So toll always > than any to220/to247
[2023-06-10T01:51:01] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: He must reduce legs length and solder right to bigger area

[2023-06-10T01:51:48] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Their software is shit
[2023-06-10T01:53:10] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Rds twice bigger than toll
[2023-06-10T01:53:21] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: And small package limit
[2023-06-10T01:53:52] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: To247 just cant maintain because of package
[2023-06-10T01:54:08] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Look at cl 3shul toll fets
[2023-06-10T01:54:37] rosheee: pulse 1100

[2023-06-10T02:36:32] rosheee: nice
[2023-06-10T02:36:50] Mirko Boni: Thank you Roger ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2023-06-10T02:37:21] Mirko Boni: @roscheeee do you know I had a fight with Amy from spintend?
[2023-06-10T02:37:34] rosheee: no
[2023-06-10T02:37:35] rosheee: what happened xD?
[2023-06-10T02:37:55] Mirko Boni: He sent me the 80V ubox with the bluetooth cable reversed, positive and negative
[2023-06-10T02:38:07] Mirko Boni: The Bluetooth module has failed
[2023-06-10T02:38:40] Mirko Boni: I wrote to Amy and she told me that I am not able to install the vesc and the bluetooth modules
[2023-06-10T02:39:41] Mirko Boni: I sent him the photos of the inverted cable and told him that I would write in all the forums and telegram channels that they don't want to replace the Bluetooth module. He replied that he was offended and won't talk to me again
[2023-06-10T02:40:30] Mirko Boni: Luckily he sent me a new bluetooth module
[2023-06-10T02:44:16] rosheee: what
[2023-06-10T02:44:17] rosheee: LOL?
[2023-06-10T02:44:19] rosheee: <sticker>
[2023-06-10T02:44:42] rosheee: but when change cables it should work
[2023-06-10T02:44:43] rosheee: not?
[2023-06-10T02:47:34] Mirko Boni: No no.. The Bluetooth module is broken
[2023-06-10T02:47:43] rosheee: Omg
[2023-06-10T02:47:50] Mirko Boni: Kaput
[2023-06-10T02:47:57] Mirko Boni: <animation>
[2023-06-10T02:48:04] rosheee: Maybe that one with telegram and groups was to hard
[2023-06-10T02:48:21] Mirko Boni: I did not understand
[2023-06-10T02:48:34] Mirko Boni: I exaggerated?
[2023-06-10T02:51:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Not really, it's the only way to get them to listen. It's stupid from them not replacing if they shipped the module with reversed polarity.

[2023-06-10T02:52:41] rosheee: "would write in all the forums and telegram channels that they don't want to replace the Bluetooth module. He replied that he was offended and won't talk to me again"
[2023-06-10T02:52:41] rosheee: this
[2023-06-10T02:53:03] rosheee: word
[2023-06-10T02:53:09] rosheee: but + and - reversed=
[2023-06-10T02:53:10] Mirko Boni: You're right.. She made me feel stupid by saying that I didn't know how to install a vesc.. Instead I installed many.. From spintend I bought 4 vesc ubox
[2023-06-10T02:53:41] Mirko Boni: Exactly.. They are reversed
[2023-06-10T02:53:59] rosheee: rofl
[2023-06-10T02:54:04] rosheee: and she say they correct
[2023-06-10T02:54:27] Mirko Boni: Did you talk to Amy? Did she tell you something?
[2023-06-10T02:55:20] rosheee: no
[2023-06-10T02:55:21] rosheee: ^^
[2023-06-10T02:55:31] rosheee: still waiting for 12fet :D
[2023-06-10T02:56:08] Mirko Boni: You will see that it will be released in September
[2023-06-10T02:57:02] rosheee: XD
[2023-06-10T02:59:31] Mirko Boni: In any case, to be safe, I bought Paolo 2 bluetooth modules..
[2023-06-10T03:03:41] rosheee: ok
[2023-06-10T10:43:16] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Noo, its prototype and only for our project
[2023-06-10T12:25:28] Face de Pin Suc√©: No, 3Shul controllers have everything integrated, you use 5V for ADC ;)
[2023-06-10T13:16:04] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Look forward to CL500 so much
[2023-06-10T13:41:30] rosheee: Like tronic
[2023-06-10T13:41:38] rosheee: Teonic smaller
[2023-06-10T13:53:14] Face de Pin Suc√©: Tronic less power

[2023-06-10T13:55:56] Jan: Im happy if anyone suggest a controller that is max 20-25mm height that is better than the tronic
[2023-06-10T13:57:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you remove the alu plate from 3shul, then it‚Äôs 120% better lol, and about 25mm height
[2023-06-10T14:02:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: If you cut sides from alu plate of 3shul, then it can fit to snsc frame of a commercial ninebot max plus lol
[2023-06-10T14:10:41] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Tronic is good, but i really like toll performance and 3shul easier to buy for me, so why not. Happy with itüëç
[2023-06-10T14:11:24] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Roschee and Jan did excellent work with tronic on g30 and their config/layout is working. So its best for them
[2023-06-10T14:11:58] Mirono escooters: Its all about what fits your project

[2023-06-10T15:08:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not the connector ?
[2023-06-10T15:08:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: And easier to cool with toll fets on IMS
[2023-06-10T15:08:50] Face de Pin Suc√©: Oh yes maybe, wait
[2023-06-10T15:09:00] Jan: 6fets ?

[2023-06-10T15:11:07] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes üòÇ
[2023-06-10T15:13:19] Jan: The tronic is 28mm
[2023-06-10T15:13:35] Jan: Which is kinda annoying that we need a 30mm spacer for that
[2023-06-10T15:15:13] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 12f toll fets, thin but big in section alu plate and thermalpaste it right to radiator of alu plate from g30 as you did with tronic and you are good to go
[2023-06-10T15:15:20] Face de Pin Suc√©: BTW, new 3shul coming with Bluetooth integrated, screwed logic board to powerboard, stronger battery bus (rated to 200A vs 150A on old gen) and more Oz IMS for better cooling
[2023-06-10T15:15:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes and don't need electrical isolated thermal pad
[2023-06-10T15:15:57] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Exactly

[2023-06-10T15:29:46] Jan: Sounds good, its either that or the spintend 12fet then
[2023-06-10T15:30:26] Jan: Tronic 2kW per fet, they find it very unfunny
[2023-06-10T15:30:59] Jan: Probably doing a second g30 build
[2023-06-10T15:31:04] Jan: But not 20s6p
[2023-06-10T15:31:07] Jan: Its too much

[2023-06-10T16:01:50] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Depends on tasks

[2023-06-10T16:04:34] Mirono escooters: Dual? Or single
[2023-06-10T16:04:37] Mirono escooters: He should be specific then
[2023-06-10T16:04:55] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ye, if 200a sum, then 10p of 40t is enough
[2023-06-10T16:05:00] Simone: obviously dual esc
[2023-06-10T16:06:01] Mirono escooters: I have to smell you have dual or what xd
[2023-06-10T16:06:20] Mirono escooters: 400a from 10p 40t is doable? I mean, it's very peak, no way you pull that longer then 10s?
[2023-06-10T16:07:34] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: It is, but the more voltage you have, the more sag it will be because higher voltage has bigger working voltage range
[2023-06-10T16:07:42] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Mean you must do more parallelsif you want save some voltage to provide good watts
[2023-06-10T16:08:38] Simone: that's why I said that a 10p is little
[2023-06-10T16:09:19] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Aaand, the other thing, that you will have some watts with less battery currents
[2023-06-10T16:09:41] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: The only thing you will worry is phase current
[2023-06-10T16:10:41] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I.e 30s10p is crazy ass powerful battery btw
[2023-06-10T16:10:42] Simone: I guess you mean danger of burning out the engines
[2023-06-10T16:11:33] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: To provide more watts from high voltage battery to motor you need a lot of phase current
[2023-06-10T16:11:53] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ofc motor specs also depends
[2023-06-10T16:12:03] Face de Pin Suc√©: Mine is 19 june hehe
[2023-06-10T16:12:05] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Need to calculate everything accurately

[2023-06-10T17:25:50] Oreo huzky: What mosfets does it use
[2023-06-10T17:32:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Same as maker base 75200
[2023-06-10T17:52:37] Thierry: If you optimize well, you can have 20s5p with 3mm spacer üòÉ.
[2023-06-10T17:53:06] Mirono escooters: Even 0mm
[2023-06-10T17:53:27] Thierry: Really? With two vesc inside?
[2023-06-10T17:53:41] Thierry: Curious to see pictures
[2023-06-10T17:54:10] Mirono escooters: Why 3mm spacer? For wires?
[2023-06-10T17:55:42] Thierry: I mean for battery cover
[2023-06-10T17:55:56] Mirono escooters: I know
[2023-06-10T17:56:02] Mirono escooters: But why? 21700 fit upright without spacer
[2023-06-10T17:56:43] Thierry: Wait will send picture
[2023-06-10T17:56:55] Oreo huzky: How can it go 120V then because the mosfets are 100V max
[2023-06-10T17:57:11] Thierry: <photos/photo_8662@10-06-2023_17-57-11.jpg>
[2023-06-10T17:57:29] Thierry: That spacer, 20s5p and two controller inside
[2023-06-10T17:57:39] Mirono escooters: Oh well, that's basically nothing
[2023-06-10T17:58:17] Thierry: That's exactly what I wanted to mean
[2023-06-10T17:58:30] Thierry: 20s5p can fit with little spacer
[2023-06-10T17:58:48] Thierry: Yes it is.
[2023-06-10T17:59:04] sombre_enfant: Really nice
[2023-06-10T17:59:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: There‚Äôs two version , one is up to 20s one 30s
[2023-06-10T18:13:53] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: C is 100v and CL is 135V
[2023-06-10T18:32:03] Oreo huzky: Ah okay
[2023-06-10T18:45:18] JPPL: I will go for cl500 as recommend for my setup, will be good times in future üòç @SibClimb sure will be this year? ;)
[2023-06-10T18:58:48] Jan: Would be awesome

[2023-06-11T12:07:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: now I really need a new motor for my PRO2, absolutely unusable XD
[2023-06-11T12:07:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: üôà
[2023-06-11T12:10:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Get the high torque one like mirko has
[2023-06-11T12:10:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes I will, don't know what mirko has, but going back to high torque is much better for me. I got high voltage anyway.
[2023-06-11T12:11:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: I lost weight again, no more prob the torqueüòÇ
[2023-06-11T12:13:07] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: nice
[2023-06-11T12:15:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I'm now at 114,8 kg after starting at 125, but it takes quite some time.
[2023-06-11T12:26:48] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: -8kg + @PaoloWu 800w + 13s = around 56kmh and a lot of Torque with Mtpa and MXLemmismash. I Hope with @Mirono_escooters new battery pack can I push my ass to 80 km/h or higher. I'm really short and skinny , I sometimes feel as if I could fly a scooterüëÄ
[2023-06-11T12:28:39] Mirono escooters: XD I'm 55kg, ezpz torque
[2023-06-11T12:29:00] Mirono escooters: U use mtpa? How is it
[2023-06-11T12:29:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: Bro skips food day
[2023-06-11T12:29:19] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: 55kgü§Ø

[2023-06-11T12:30:37] Mirono escooters: I eat so much
[2023-06-11T12:33:44] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: at @PaoloWu 's 800w it makes 5 kmh more Top Speed for me and with MXLemming and Mtpa does it feels like a "punch" from Zero Speed up to top speed üòÇüòÇüëÄ
[2023-06-11T12:34:24] Mirono escooters: @jamessoderstrom noticed alot of A draw whenever it felt like it xf
[2023-06-11T12:34:33] Mirono escooters: I haven't tried mtpa yet, I haven't looked into it
[2023-06-11T12:37:15] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: I find it funny if I got it right Mtpa works significantly better with the 800w than with the 1200w motor and somehow it doesn't work for everyone sometimes very weird with vesc controller üëÄ
[2023-06-11T12:40:13] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: so you overshot your battery then? Which Vesc controller are you using and have you tried a different one?üôà or same battery but different motors?üëÄ
[2023-06-11T12:41:30] Martin Kaktits: For me MTPA + mxlemming gave *little* less torque at low speed (sub 10kmh) and felt little more noisy, less smooth. But I also dont have halls working for some reason, driving in VSS
[2023-06-11T12:41:37] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: I don't like the controller at all, in my opinion, the software is somehow unnecessary
[2023-06-11T12:43:26] Mirko Boni: üò±üò±üò±üò±üò± But Paolo, is my engine not standard?
[2023-06-11T12:43:59] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: cooling doesn't exist where it doesn't exist XD you would have had to get it separately xd
[2023-06-11T12:45:00] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: which motors do you use also Paolo 800w?
[2023-06-11T12:45:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: Really don‚Äôt exist what is standard winding, but 17x4 in this group was always assigned as standard winding, but face de pin calls it high torque. But exactly don‚Äôt exist high kv low kv or what, exist only winding type and Kv.
[2023-06-11T12:47:53] Mirko Boni: I have seen that this motor with the same settings has the same speed as the vsett 10 motor
[2023-06-11T12:49:20] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: no actually not yet but now that you mentioned it I'm also sure that it has already shot beyond my set batt amps but not much, not like yours, but at the moment I'm still driving 13s Hfi and didn't want to change anything until the new Batt to save me a headache but when I have the new battery in I will definitely test it, I will definitely start again from 0 to compare the differences like amps kmh with and without Mtpa and so on üëÄ
[2023-06-11T12:50:27] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: alwaysüëå

[2023-06-11T13:12:09] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: jes i believe also from hearingüëÄ better upgrade instead of putting the money into a Gen2 which many do first xd
[2023-06-11T13:12:35] Mirono escooters: Gen2 always scam price
[2023-06-11T13:12:46] Mirono escooters: Maybe @jamessoderstrom still Has motors?

[2023-06-11T18:06:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: C700 / CL700, perfect for that
[2023-06-11T18:14:40] Mirono escooters: Fucki loud
[2023-06-11T18:14:49] Mirono escooters: Wich BMS?
[2023-06-11T18:15:05] Jason Nelson: It is daly 16s
[2023-06-11T18:15:12] Jason Nelson: I'm trying to check limits
[2023-06-11T18:15:32] Mirono escooters: Shouldn't your builder know that xd
[2023-06-11T18:23:03] Happy Giraffe: Now I got settings for smaller geared motors, mxlemming lambda comp, thermal compensation, without BEMF coupling
[2023-06-11T18:23:12] Mirono escooters: Hmm
[2023-06-11T18:23:34] Happy Giraffe: If going ortega or cross bmf coupling it starts to stutter, now smooth af
[2023-06-11T18:24:04] Mirono escooters: I never ever even touched those things
[2023-06-11T18:24:42] Happy Giraffe: On scooter the decoupling worked ok
[2023-06-11T18:57:42] Jason Nelson: I got it second hand. The person I got it from isn't sure and it's a few years old
[2023-06-11T18:58:23] Mirono escooters: Daly is very unpredictable in ratings
[2023-06-11T18:58:35] Mirono escooters: Check whatever is set in protection settings Should be or max bms or max cells
[2023-06-11T18:58:39] Mirono escooters: Shouldn't cross it
[2023-06-11T18:58:56] Jason Nelson: I'm trying to find the charge limit to see if I can parallel charge it
[2023-06-11T18:59:07] Mirono escooters: Also there
[2023-06-11T18:59:16] Jason Nelson: The cells can take 2.45 to 5 amps and I have five in a pairing
[2023-06-11T18:59:47] Mirono escooters: Well, 25
[2023-06-11T19:02:21] Jason Nelson: That's the cells but the BMS should have it's own limits that's what I'm trying to find
[2023-06-11T19:02:31] Mirono escooters: If it's build well, it'll be higher
[2023-06-11T19:02:42] Jason Nelson: You can't charge at 25a if the BMS can't balance that fast I don't think
[2023-06-11T19:02:44] Jason Nelson: Okay
[2023-06-11T19:02:45] Mirono escooters: BMS charge limit, is usually very high of smart BMS, if common port especially
[2023-06-11T19:02:53] Mirono escooters: Daly is 30ma balancing üíÄ
[2023-06-11T19:03:00] Mirono escooters: Its shit
[2023-06-11T19:03:05] Mirono escooters: But if build well, no worries
[2023-06-11T19:03:09] Mirono escooters: Check cell deviation
[2023-06-11T19:03:12] Mirono escooters: If it's ok, just do it
[2023-06-11T19:03:16] Jason Nelson: Okay
[2023-06-11T19:03:21] Jason Nelson: I suppose I can monitor
[2023-06-11T19:03:25] Jason Nelson: Thank you
[2023-06-11T19:56:41] Happy Giraffe: I usually leave it once a month for charging overnightüòÅ
[2023-06-11T19:57:00] Happy Giraffe: Should balance if cells are like 4.18V (cant remember exact value)

[2023-06-11T20:01:47] Jason Nelson: Okay
[2023-06-11T20:02:09] Mirono escooters: If its a good charger w cc cv

[2023-06-11T20:02:25] AK: Has nothing to do with the charger
[2023-06-11T20:02:43] AK: Any power source will behave that way, that's just battery physics
[2023-06-11T20:03:25] AK: Current you get from potential dofference between charger and battery, more difference = more current, as much current as the power source can provide
[2023-06-11T20:04:20] AK: So if you charge with end voltage in the charger reasonably close to your battaries end voltage, this graph will look like that all day erry day
[2023-06-11T20:04:35] Mirono escooters: Na, lol
[2023-06-11T20:04:43] Mirono escooters: Some chargers ramp up voltage so they can keep the A

[2023-06-11T20:06:03] AK: You would have to go out of your way to get such behaviour, deliberately configuring stuff wrong
[2023-06-11T20:06:30] AK: Or charge a 14s bat with a 20s charger, for example
[2023-06-11T20:07:14] Mirono escooters: Oh boy, do I have a thing for you
[2023-06-11T20:07:25] Mirono escooters: People charge 10s+12s with Rita and a 12s charger
[2023-06-11T20:07:25] Mirono escooters: :)
[2023-06-11T20:07:33] Mirono escooters: Some chinese do it

[2023-06-11T20:12:42] Finn: Just a question. Why would you need 4A balancing for your battery pack
[2023-06-11T20:13:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: I‚Äôm battery maker, when you repair packs it saves you time, and you know time = money. Surely I don‚Äôt wait 0.010A of Daly
[2023-06-11T20:14:41] Finn: Thats pretty smart. Maybe i will get one too. Can you use a 20s one for a 10s battery or are there different combinations
[2023-06-11T20:14:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: Reverse current, I tried to revive my old Ninebot battery series, with power supply. But seems reverse current damaged the circuit
[2023-06-11T20:15:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: It can be used from 8s to 24s

[2023-06-13T09:57:33] Mirono escooters: 80-120
[2023-06-13T09:57:42] Mirono escooters: Battery depends on battery limit, but too much will burn motor

[2023-06-13T10:00:30] TrentXWB: You mean 120A to motor? When I do the motor setup it says motor can handle ca. 50A. My BMS is also 50A Max
[2023-06-13T10:01:06] Mirono escooters: Ignore setup values
[2023-06-13T10:01:08] Finn: The 50A is phase in the detection setup
[2023-06-13T10:01:17] TrentXWB: Ah ok
[2023-06-13T11:02:23] TrentXWB: Changes improved a little bit. Max ampere during acceleration is ca. 48/49 amps. Is that due to my 50A Daly BMS on my 13S5P battery? If there is a tiny hill and I want to accelerate from 0 it‚Äôs nearly impossible. Above ca. 15 km/h acceleration is fine up to 40 km/h. Is that due to 48V? Scooter with original controller has much more torque at low speed‚Ä¶ (36V)

[2023-06-13T12:19:32] Finn: Isnt the dectection amps the phase amps at which the motor is running at its best
[2023-06-13T12:20:00] Finn: Everything over this value could result in oversaturation and stuttering? I had that issue

So its very useful for me to make calcs from that numbers, just: new.speed/100kmh = coefficient X. X¬≤ = how many times will it differ, wind resistance at a new speed. X¬≥ √ó 7000-8000watts = new required continuous power consumption at new speed. It works always true. You can lean to stearing wheel so low and make watts even lower a little. Also your clothes as a factor too

[2023-06-13T17:18:34] D J: I did üòÅ
[2023-06-13T18:26:16] TrentXWB: I set motor power to 120A and Battery Power to 30A. Scooter accelerates perfect and top speed ca 42 km/h! But after 5, 6 accelerations torque decreases at low speed and also stuttering kicks in. Is that due to Flipsky 75100 temperature (ca. 70 degC)?
[2023-06-13T18:32:50] Mirono escooters: Yes, temp protection kick in
[2023-06-13T18:32:56] Mirono escooters: Bolt it to frame w thermal pad

[2023-06-14T08:22:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Than if that direct support keyignition and there is can, you wire the master one
[2023-06-14T08:27:45] Oreo huzky: How
[2023-06-14T08:30:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You just claimed it supports it
[2023-06-14T08:31:59] D J: Wire key ignition to both vesc
[2023-06-14T08:32:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If its not claimed, Than You could use that instead off the button switch,but not all like that
[2023-06-14T08:32:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: No can? Or just random saying thisüòÖ
[2023-06-14T08:33:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You never wire like so ,since can
[2023-06-14T08:33:52] D J: or else you can connect 5V from the controller that has ignition to the other... so when you turn on 1, turn on the other with 5V
[2023-06-14T08:34:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yeah describe can üòÖ

[2023-06-14T23:09:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Poor mounting I guess
[2023-06-14T23:11:33] Finn: Yeah
[2023-06-14T23:15:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: U need Alu PCB and this heatsink üëÄ
[2023-06-14T23:15:42] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But I bet your Alu bottom cover would be enough as well
[2023-06-14T23:15:48] Finn: Send me one‚ò∫Ô∏è
[2023-06-14T23:15:49] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: it would probably be even better than this
[2023-06-14T23:15:59] Finn: You think?
[2023-06-14T23:16:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes
[2023-06-14T23:16:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It might be thin, but it's very close to air
[2023-06-14T23:16:12] Finn: Maybe i should just screw the controller to the bottom plate
[2023-06-14T23:16:15] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: How thicc is it?
[2023-06-14T23:16:29] Finn: Heatsinks from rasberry pi with thermal glueüòÇüòÇ
[2023-06-14T23:17:14] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yeah you can extend it with heatsink if it's not enough, getting heatsink, drill 4 holes and screw it on to Alu PCB
[2023-06-14T23:17:15] Finn: Same as yours
[2023-06-14T23:17:16] Finn: 3mm
[2023-06-14T23:17:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Enough
[2023-06-14T23:17:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Why I didn't come up with this before

[2023-06-14T23:21:37] Finn: The boxüòÇ
[2023-06-14T23:21:42] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: hm
[2023-06-14T23:21:46] Finn: Do you have one laying arround that works?
[2023-06-14T23:21:54] Finn: A alupcb
[2023-06-14T23:22:04] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Uhm yes
[2023-06-14T23:22:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Two working and one with dead DC-DC (the Flipsky one)
[2023-06-14T23:22:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but I don't know, I think I need them
[2023-06-14T23:22:33] Finn: Wanna have my flipsky with the new mosfets then and +40‚Ç¨

[2023-06-14T23:23:45] Finn: But lets wait after survival master meeting
[2023-06-14T23:24:07] Finn: The broken one theres only the dc dc not working?
[2023-06-14T23:24:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: uhm the one that wanted to be a vibrator instead?

[2023-06-15T19:35:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: Like huashuo, claimed 1.8mR but it‚Äôs measured from the drain pad , not the leg‚Ä¶. And yes, the crss is crazy‚Ä¶
[2023-06-15T19:42:38] Finn: Whats the pinout of these
[2023-06-15T19:42:50] Finn: I always wonder how they are wired up
[2023-06-15T19:43:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs always the same, one leg is gate, 7 are source, the bottom pad is drain
[2023-06-15T19:44:04] Finn: Interestingüëç
[2023-06-15T20:15:43] Konstantin: Flipsky use this and other. I was poster photo. And measuring on yr3510 both

[2023-06-15T20:17:13] Konstantin: Y xD
[2023-06-15T20:17:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: And no, that‚Äôs not same. Yr1035 measures impedance , not internal DC resistance. Impedance is always lower than dc resistance

[2023-06-15T20:42:52] J√°nos T√≥th: Hi, I have 2 makerbase 75100 alu, and one of tham don'rlt wanna turn on every time. It works works works, and than for 1 hour it dont, and after another hour it again. Blue lights comes on, but the green OK does not. I also can't connect to it with usb, or with bluetooth either. Have been anybody in this situation in the past? I thinking on a chip resolder, voltages are fine.
[2023-06-15T21:22:20] Konstantin: makerbase xD , try to hot air mcu ... Or solder by hand, 1mm bc tips ok for manual
[2023-06-15T21:22:57] Konstantin: Few weeks ago fix 1, work like u say;) boot 1:10...

[2023-06-15T23:46:59] Oreo huzky: Thanks

[2023-06-15T23:48:42] Mirono escooters: Doesn't matter where it's connected to
[2023-06-16T00:29:05] Oreo huzky: Okay
[2023-06-16T01:06:28] Oreo huzky: For programming with usb do I have to wire usb plus and minus to a usb cable plus/minus or do I have to wire something else

[2023-06-16T02:53:30] Oreo huzky: They are both shorted between plus and minus and won‚Äôt turn on
[2023-06-16T07:11:07] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes you have to wire 5V or it won't work
[2023-06-16T11:47:53] S1m 0n: My cable has been strained while driving... can anyone give a rough estimate if it is enough to replace the cable? Possibly also the controller? I'm worried that the Hall sensors have also got too much load... would then buy me ehr n new engine, instead of the effort to operate

[2023-06-16T11:48:25] Mirono escooters: If the wrong stuff shorted, motor halls gone, controller gone
[2023-06-16T11:48:45] Mirono escooters: Atleast give it a go replacing wire
[2023-06-16T11:50:34] S1m 0n: Hm... Then I try to fix the cable quick 'n' dirty. If that works I can still think about the complete cable to replace
[2023-06-16T11:51:28] Mirono escooters: That's the logical thing todo
[2023-06-16T11:56:52] S1m 0n: Actually, no desire... could also just go over to IO Hawk and buy me n new
[2023-06-16T11:57:33] Mirono escooters: But ‚Ç¨
[2023-06-16T11:57:38] Mirono escooters: Its a waste

[2023-06-16T13:36:31] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes. It is basically hardware ADC but passed from software. So it allows me to make all functions that use ADC work.
[2023-06-16T13:43:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Also makes it easier for me to keep functionally if people want to use script without software ADC.
[2023-06-16T14:03:57] Mirono escooters: Omg, so config curves and shizzl?

[2023-06-17T09:28:28] puneDir: would vesc get harmed by it ?
[2023-06-17T09:29:14] Mirono escooters: üòê no
[2023-06-17T09:29:29] Mirono escooters: But its you so wHo knows
[2023-06-17T09:29:30] puneDir: weird that xiaomi esc dies from sparks but vesc not
[2023-06-17T09:29:39] Mirono escooters: IT DOES NOT
[2023-06-17T09:29:44] puneDir: dont worry im pretty normal these days
[2023-06-17T09:29:59] Mirono escooters: Ehhhhh
[2023-06-17T10:02:31] TrentXWB: I have 2x Flipsky 75100 for 2x motors. Is it possible in the VESC tool to provide more amps to the rear motor (Flipsky No. 2 in CAN)?
[2023-06-17T10:18:57] Mirono escooters: Just set your amps for nr2 higher?

[2023-06-17T12:29:14] Finn: Controller üòü
[2023-06-17T12:29:41] Finn: I really need to swap
[2023-06-17T12:32:13] Finn: It does
[2023-06-17T12:32:22] Finn: But the mosfets are really fucking trash
[2023-06-17T12:34:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes. They will heat 24/7, even at lower current. You need to reduce the frequency, otherwise they will get too warm.
[2023-06-17T12:39:02] puneDir: I have 2 75100s
[2023-06-17T12:39:13] puneDir: I drilled their heatsink to same chassis
[2023-06-17T12:39:18] puneDir: Will it short?
[2023-06-17T12:46:56] Finn: It fucking stays at 40Cüò≠

[2023-06-17T13:02:25] Finn: Maybe that will help

[2023-06-17T13:07:49] Mirono escooters: Doubt
[2023-06-17T13:08:00] Mirono escooters: Your scoot is a massive heatsink
[2023-06-17T13:09:54] Finn: Nah bro
[2023-06-17T13:10:13] Finn: Its passive coolijg without fins
[2023-06-17T13:10:26] Finn: And when the air gets through it will cool better then the case
[2023-06-17T13:10:34] Mirono escooters: Bruh
[2023-06-17T13:10:48] Mirono escooters: Passive sure But have you seen the sheer size of this frame?
[2023-06-17T13:10:55] Mirono escooters: You can't saturate that with heat
[2023-06-17T13:11:03] Mirono escooters: @AJAJ1992 , please support me on thisüôà
[2023-06-17T13:11:07] Finn: Yes but it will slowly heat uo
[2023-06-17T13:11:16] Finn: I mean youre not wrong
[2023-06-17T13:11:18] Mirono escooters: Na bro
[2023-06-17T13:11:20] Finn: Its better then nothing
[2023-06-17T13:11:25] Mirono escooters: You ride, air gets over it
[2023-06-17T13:11:30] Finn: Yes
[2023-06-17T13:11:32] Finn: Over thr heatsink
[2023-06-17T13:11:36] Mirono escooters: Its a massive heatsink If your vesc overheats, its not because of lack of heatsink
[2023-06-17T13:11:40] Finn: Yyeess
[2023-06-17T13:11:42] Finn: I understand bro
[2023-06-17T13:11:55] Mirono escooters: Ah pointless discussion No point adding such a small heatsink fin
[2023-06-17T13:12:02] Finn: Lets see
[2023-06-17T13:12:24] Mirono escooters: I'm happy to be proven wrong.
[2023-06-17T13:12:30] Finn: Lets try
[2023-06-17T13:19:10] Mirono escooters: ü•∞
[2023-06-17T13:19:27] Mirono escooters: Impossible
[2023-06-17T13:19:38] Mirono escooters: If heat transfer good, it's nothing to worry
[2023-06-17T13:19:48] Mirono escooters: He's being limited by thermal transfer not frame, but he no listen
[2023-06-17T13:22:39] Finn: Yes i know
[2023-06-17T13:22:48] Finn: And bad efficiency mosfets
[2023-06-17T13:23:10] Finn: Its not thai give a fuck what you say. I just mean it could be imoroved with better cooling
[2023-06-17T13:24:47] Mirono escooters: Hehe
[2023-06-17T13:25:15] Finn: I replaced thermal pad with thermal glue
[2023-06-17T13:27:24] Mirono escooters: Whaa
[2023-06-17T13:27:31] Mirono escooters: Thermal glue got way worse heating transfer üò≠üò≠
[2023-06-17T13:27:44] Mirono escooters: You make my heart hurt
[2023-06-17T13:27:51] Mirono escooters: Its worse
[2023-06-17T13:28:10] Mirono escooters: Its for leds with little heat diss
[2023-06-17T13:34:34] TrentXWB: You mean, if I set values it copies to Controller Nr. 2 all times? So I have to switch to controller Nr 2 and change amps?

[2023-06-18T00:41:42] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but it's not worth updating, 6.05 will be worth (for me).
[2023-06-18T00:51:52] Finn: What does the changelog say

[2023-06-19T12:12:13] Medhi Cantin: For me the problem is not the script is good, it's the fact that the software can't delete the old one
[2023-06-19T12:12:48] Medhi Cantin: Please help my just missing the script and the scooter she rides
[2023-06-19T12:14:07] Medhi Cantin: if someone can help me kindly

If somebody has the same problem, resolder the MCU. I taked a look at it and it was a big big mess. It was twisted a bit, one side has too much, and the other side has almost zero solder on it. Now its working perfect.

[2023-06-19T20:54:58] Patrick: Ich habe beide vesc gleich eingerichtet und der frontmotor dreht etwas langsamer bei gleichen settings. Wenn ich zu schnell ans Gas gehe ist es so als w√ºrde er einen Krampf bekommen, gibt eine Sekunde weiter Gas und dann reagiert nichts mehr und nach 3sekunden geht es wieder. Und bei einem Controller ist auch kein Bluetooth sichtbar, hab auch schon einzeln versucht. Ich bin echt am Verzweifeln üò©ü•∫
[2023-06-19T21:00:51] Oreo huzky: Sind die Motoren gleich?
[2023-06-19T22:03:00] Jason Nelson: Is there a way to lock horizontal mode on my phone?
[2023-06-19T22:16:40] Patrick: Ja sind gleich. Jetzt versuche ich die im single modus einzeln mal üòï

[2023-06-19T22:29:07] Mirono escooters: I need one for my bike
[2023-06-19T22:29:09] Mirono escooters: Testing purposes

[2023-06-19T22:41:24] Oreo huzky: Nice nami body
[2023-06-19T22:41:49] Oreo huzky: Stottert der beim Gas geben?
[2023-06-19T22:49:46] Patrick: Ich hab so leider nie fahren k√∂nnen. Nur zum testen aufgebockt üòÅ
[2023-06-19T22:50:55] Patrick: Der macht das also auch alleine. Hab es gerade getestet. üòï Also 2Controller, bei einem geht das Bluetooth nicht und beim anderen dreht er einfach ab üò©
[2023-06-19T22:51:11] Patrick: Danke üòä
[2023-06-19T22:51:20] Oreo huzky: Schick mir mal ein Video vom ‚ÄûKrampf‚Äú
[2023-06-19T22:51:33] Oreo huzky: Welche Controller?
[2023-06-19T22:52:02] Patrick: Das hat er nur im DualModus gemacht, also wenn beide angeschlossen waren.
[2023-06-19T22:52:09] Patrick: Tronic250R
[2023-06-19T22:53:00] Patrick: Das einzige was mir jetzt noch einf√§llt ist beide Motoren verkehrt anstecken und nochmal testen
[2023-06-19T22:53:01] Oreo huzky: Verwendest du can?
[2023-06-19T22:53:18] Oreo huzky: Eigentlich ist das bei vesc egal
[2023-06-19T22:53:22] Patrick: Vorher ja, jetzt teste ich die alleine üòÅ

[2023-06-19T22:55:33] Oreo huzky: Passt doch alles im Video
[2023-06-19T22:55:45] Oreo huzky: L√∂tschtelle sich gel√∂st?
[2023-06-19T22:56:55] Patrick: Ja das ist der Controller wo so alles passt, aber eben das Bluetooth nicht funktioniert. Beim anderen funktioniert Bluetooth, aber der hat eben das Problem, dass er abschaltet. Es ist zum Verzweifeln üò©
[2023-06-19T22:57:42] Patrick: Nein das ist absolut ausgeschlossen, das ist richtig wild verl√∂tet üòé
[2023-06-19T22:57:44] Oreo huzky: Unter Last?
[2023-06-19T22:58:08] Patrick: Schon in der Luft, aber ja nur wenn man schnell ans Gas geht.
[2023-06-19T22:58:21] Patrick: Und es richt kommt mir vor etwas seltsam
[2023-06-19T22:58:45] Patrick: riecht*
[2023-06-19T22:59:46] Oreo huzky: Hmm vielleicht control board low PowerStage defekt

[2023-06-19T23:00:15] Patrick: Kann ich das irgendwie testen?
[2023-06-19T23:01:18] Oreo huzky: Wenn du es aufbaust und dann an denn Strom ansteckst kannst du mit der Hand nachf√ºhlen ob ein Chip warm wird das wird meistens der defekte Chip sein hab das so bei meinem cl350 gemacht

[2023-06-20T18:01:37] puneDir: Guys i have 2 vescs connected with canbus
[2023-06-20T18:01:51] puneDir: But my wheels arent getting same power even theyre same setting
[2023-06-20T18:02:04] puneDir: Theres a thing called traction controll and i want to disable it
[2023-06-20T18:02:08] puneDir: How can i do it?
[2023-06-20T18:02:14] puneDir: I want 50-50 power to make wheelies
[2023-06-20T18:24:03] JPPL: Traction control is off by default
[2023-06-20T19:12:12] puneDir: No theyre not
[2023-06-20T19:12:24] puneDir: They got different
[2023-06-20T19:12:43] puneDir: I dont have logs atm but
[2023-06-20T19:12:56] puneDir: If i take the front wheel in air back get less power
[2023-06-20T19:13:01] puneDir: How to open it?
[2023-06-20T19:13:03] puneDir: I want to test
[2023-06-20T19:15:07] Mirono escooters: Batt sagging?
[2023-06-20T19:15:46] puneDir: what
[2023-06-20T19:15:52] puneDir: Its not sagging
[2023-06-20T19:15:55] puneDir: I tested on air
[2023-06-20T19:16:15] puneDir: How do vesc tcs work?
[2023-06-20T19:16:25] puneDir: Will it help me to make wheelies
[2023-06-20T19:16:35] puneDir: Taking power from front to back
[2023-06-20T19:16:46] puneDir: I can do wheelies
[2023-06-20T19:16:55] puneDir: with just rwd

[2023-06-20T19:17:13] puneDir: my goofy ahh scooter
[2023-06-20T19:17:49] puneDir: no
[2023-06-20T19:17:58] puneDir: Giving 2x power to just back
[2023-06-20T19:18:39] puneDir: Is there a way to do that automaticly
[2023-06-20T19:18:56] puneDir: Like if front wheel loses traction give all power to back
[2023-06-20T19:38:22] Diego: Guys the pro 2 motor kv is approximately 22kv?
[2023-06-20T19:38:32] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-06-20T19:42:53] Diego: But it has little power. If I could find one of 500/800w at nominal 22kv with the same dimensions as the original motor (provided it is possible to obtain this power with the same spaces) in 15s and with 10 inch wheels I would most likely go 65 kmh but with a torque much greater? *I'm thinking about the size because I would like it to fit in the original fork of the scooter * I'm doing a crash course in bldc motors with ChatGPT, that thing knows everything üòÇ
[2023-06-20T19:46:43] Martin Kaktits: 65kmh is hard, lots of power, not just kv
[2023-06-20T19:47:32] Mirono escooters: Original dimensions no bueno
[2023-06-20T19:48:07] Diego: I would still use the original controller and a constant 50A home made battery
[2023-06-20T19:48:25] Martin Kaktits: its like 2-3kw sustained
[2023-06-20T19:48:45] Mirono escooters: Just get monorim, Invert it
[2023-06-20T19:48:47] Mirono escooters: And bigger motor
[2023-06-20T19:49:16] Diego: 3kw for how many seconds?
[2023-06-20T19:49:28] Martin Kaktits: for hower many seconds u drive at such speed
[2023-06-20T19:50:01] Diego: sorry I do not understand. I do not speak English well
[2023-06-20T19:50:07] Mirono escooters: Continuous
[2023-06-20T19:50:09] Mirono escooters: Always
[2023-06-20T19:50:10] Martin Kaktits: sustained power
[2023-06-20T19:50:43] Diego: Ooookay, thank you. 50A x 63V= 3150W, not bad
[2023-06-20T19:51:17] Martin Kaktits: + sag + poor xiaomi esc
[2023-06-20T19:52:05] Martin Kaktits: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ
[2023-06-20T19:52:54] Diego: In the end, it's just a first approach. I'd keep everything except the esc for this pretty racy mod. Otherwise I wouldn't have come here to snoop üòã
[2023-06-20T19:54:21] Martin Kaktits: welcome to the world of scooter mods
[2023-06-20T20:38:10] Yosi Moreno: How is the cooling at the ubox v2 ? Is it any good? Or do i need to add heatsink or a fan
[2023-06-20T20:38:52] Mirono escooters: Good enough
[2023-06-20T20:38:57] Mirono escooters: Just bolt to your scooter frame

[2023-06-21T17:47:06] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes. Ideal scooter frame. And the handling at this speed is excellent. No wobbling, no shutter, no jitter at all. I can lean, turn at that speed etc.. The frame will behave exactly how I want it and how much I want (the predictability is the same as on a motorcycle). If I have a slight bumps/holes, there are only two/three steering oscillations, and then stable again. This speed not for everyday but feels safe. Also that model for track purposes
[2023-06-21T17:47:38] Mirono escooters: I want one
[2023-06-21T18:20:59] Alin Ciobanu: Motor original ?
[2023-06-21T18:21:08] Jan: Disassembly is a lot more complex

[2023-06-21T18:33:05] Finn: Hey does anyone know how i can turn up the amps on a typical china wate charger? I ordered a 10A charger and said they should turn it down to 8A.
[2023-06-21T18:33:08] Mirono escooters: I dare you to repair it
[2023-06-21T18:33:10] Finn: <photos/photo_8761@21-06-2023_18-33-10.jpg>
[2023-06-21T18:33:18] Finn: Holy smokes
[2023-06-21T18:33:18] Mirono escooters: If u have luck there's a potentiometer
[2023-06-21T18:33:33] Finn: There are 3
[2023-06-21T18:33:42] Finn: One cutoff one voltage and one amps
[2023-06-21T18:33:43] Mirono escooters: And I wouldn't even mess w it, china margins
[2023-06-21T18:33:50] Mirono escooters: Yes, have fun figuring out wich is what :)
[2023-06-21T18:33:51] Mirono escooters: Ask factory
[2023-06-21T18:34:00] Finn: Yeah they will answer in 12H
[2023-06-21T18:34:03] Mirono escooters: Or turn One a little andD see

[2023-06-21T18:39:49] Konstantin: Few days ago on 1 wheel I'm installing new tires... R more than was... Traction was enable
[2023-06-21T18:41:19] Mirono escooters: How many vescs habe you killed already xd
[2023-06-21T18:55:47] Unknown: Which ones ?
[2023-06-21T18:56:01] Finn: Yeah i tried that. I will try that again
[2023-06-21T19:01:02] S1m 0n: does anyone recognize the model? allegedly an in-house development by IO Hawk. with legal 2x500W and 11" tires and suspension at the push of a button + replaceable battery. non-legal version with 2x2000W

[2023-06-21T19:27:30] Mirono escooters: New model?
[2023-06-21T19:27:58] AK: They have their pcbs by wattage
[2023-06-21T19:28:05] AK: on each you have 3 potentiometers
[2023-06-21T19:28:10] Konstantin: No, 75100 alu...not pro
[2023-06-21T19:28:13] AK: voltage, current, cut-off current
[2023-06-21T19:28:25] AK: Don't go over specced power in total
[2023-06-21T19:29:05] Konstantin: Not cut off...cut off only blower...and red change to green led...like battery charged...
[2023-06-21T19:29:20] AK: It is cutoff
[2023-06-21T19:29:24] AK: I tested personally
[2023-06-21T19:29:34] AK: on the 360w pcb at least
[2023-06-21T19:29:41] Konstantin: Sec...
[2023-06-21T19:30:17] Konstantin: Both w/o cutt off
[2023-06-21T19:33:45] Finn: Yes. I have a 10A which they set down to 8A bc i told them.
[2023-06-21T19:33:56] Finn: Do you know which exaclty resistor is wwhichp
[2023-06-21T19:35:36] AK: Voltage, current, cut off current
[2023-06-21T19:35:41] AK: From top to bottom
[2023-06-21T19:35:54] Mirono escooters: The legend himself
[2023-06-21T19:46:25] Finn: Thanksüëç
[2023-06-21T19:50:41] Finn: I would guess VR1 is the voltage and VR3 the cutoff current
[2023-06-21T19:52:06] AK: You have a different one, but I don't see why you don't simply try?
[2023-06-21T19:52:14] AK: You just need a multimeter, that's it
[2023-06-21T19:52:32] AK: plug it in to charge a semi-empty battery, adjust slowly, you will find current
[2023-06-21T19:52:34] Finn: Yes i tried. The bottom one is voltage. But current doesnt change on the two above
[2023-06-21T19:52:59] Finn: Mine is kinda full and starts to lower amps. I will try later when it is half emptyüëç
[2023-06-21T19:53:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Hm doesn't match
[2023-06-21T19:53:51] Finn: Wait there are labels
[2023-06-21T19:54:29] Finn: VR3 is cutoff Current VR2 is Current VR1 is Voltage
[2023-06-21T19:54:41] AK: Do that, and then you will habe all three
[2023-06-21T19:54:50] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I am wondering why is there no VR2 but V4
[2023-06-21T19:54:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: just try
[2023-06-21T19:55:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: üòÇ

[2023-06-21T20:36:46] AK: Perhaps there are different board revisions
[2023-06-21T22:28:03] JPPL: I love this, I didn't reach 146 yet

[2023-06-22T00:15:50] Simone: shiny welds and copper strands perfectly joined with tin
[2023-06-22T00:16:33] Simone: cooking meat?

[2023-06-22T00:18:45] Newuser G: Hello Guys Anyone can help for connect spin y v2 from spintend in UBOX V2?
[2023-06-22T00:18:49] Mirono escooters: Repairable
[2023-06-22T00:18:57] Mirono escooters: Welcome back nicolo
[2023-06-22T00:19:04] Mirono escooters: How is V2 spiny quality
[2023-06-22T00:19:06] Newuser G: Ciao Miro
[2023-06-22T00:19:32] Newuser G: Look great
[2023-06-22T00:19:35] Simone: How?
[2023-06-22T00:19:56] Mirono escooters: Alot of work but doable
[2023-06-22T00:20:29] Mirono escooters: Clean it well and resolder
[2023-06-22T00:21:39] Newuser G: Tomorrow I share pics Yesterday I try to connect, throttle work great but I can‚Äôt understand how to use brake I follow instructions, now send email to Spintend team
[2023-06-22T00:22:15] Newuser G: Miro, see you soon üòâ
[2023-06-22T00:23:39] Mirono escooters: Yes soonüòä
[2023-06-22T00:27:16] Newuser G: 5v (red wire) to 3,3v on UBOX V2, Gnd (black wire) and back button (orange wire) to GND on UBOX V2, vesc throttle (white wire) to ADC1 and variable brake (Blue wire) to ADC2. It‚Äôs correct?
[2023-06-22T00:27:16] Newuser G: <photos/photo_8784@22-06-2023_00-27-16.jpg>
[2023-06-22T00:29:02] Newuser G: Missing yellow?
[2023-06-22T01:35:13] Newuser G: Yeah
[2023-06-22T01:35:41] Newuser G: Under input setting
[2023-06-22T07:44:29] Mihail: Could be avoided with a proper bms.
[2023-06-22T09:21:19] Konstantin: It's not bms issues....
[2023-06-22T09:24:14] Mihail: I think it is. My bms protected battery has no issues while my original vsett 10+ battery does similar damage to controllers when something goes wrong. These pictures look like there was no bms at all, or one with very slow protection, rendering it useless.
[2023-06-22T09:32:27] Konstantin: Bms can handle big current, happened on 0-3 km speed...w/0 use brake or throttle....;))) And eco mode 30/100a... And 2nd esc in good condition ;) just look at this....
[2023-06-22T09:32:31] Konstantin: <photos/photo_8785@22-06-2023_09-32-31.jpg>
[2023-06-22T09:32:44] Konstantin: Need decrease bms max current;)))
[2023-06-22T09:37:35] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Omg it looks like the crocodile ate it
[2023-06-22T09:40:14] Mihail: Aren't there separate settings for max current and short circuit current
[2023-06-22T09:40:44] Mihail: Ive set max current on mine a bit above tripping point and it is set to trip after 3 seconds
[2023-06-22T09:41:09] Mihail: But short circuit is set higher and trips in 150uS
[2023-06-22T09:50:59] Konstantin: Was my setting
[2023-06-22T09:53:31] puneDir: 1000a?
[2023-06-22T09:54:27] Konstantin: Need decrease;))) to much...)) And change time to lower value;))
[2023-06-22T10:17:47] Mihail: So bms is virtually non-existant üò≥
[2023-06-22T10:25:45] Thierry: What cells and how many p and s?
[2023-06-22T10:26:19] Thierry: For 90A I would set less hw protection
[2023-06-22T10:40:02] Konstantin: 50/50... Need decrease...but... 1 cool feature... If something happens on speed, and phase wires self desolder... You can safety stop ;)))
[2023-06-22T10:41:06] Konstantin: Any way it's was esc fault, not bms/battery. 2 same vesc, same setting etc, and burn only 1.
[2023-06-22T11:41:47] asyan4ik: Orly ?
[2023-06-22T11:47:56] Konstantin: Move top, and see all magic ;)))
[2023-06-22T17:03:32] Jason Nelson: <photos/photo_8787@22-06-2023_17-03-32.jpg>
[2023-06-22T17:03:49] Jason Nelson: After I used the battery the first time the smart BMS app only looks like this
[2023-06-22T17:04:03] Jason Nelson: Is it possible I have a loose connection to my Bluetooth module?
[2023-06-22T17:09:52] Martin Kaktits: yo. If all hall sensors in motor are not identical and read slightly different values (3.2v on one and like 2.8v on others) - is that going to be a problem? Does vesc figure it out and/ or is it within tolerance?
[2023-06-22T19:04:17] Jason Nelson: Is it still safe to charge?
[2023-06-22T19:05:01] Mirono escooters: Its not connected
[2023-06-22T19:05:05] Mirono escooters: It will be fine
[2023-06-22T19:05:10] Mirono escooters: Next time consider something else then Daly
[2023-06-22T19:05:36] Mirono escooters: Are you sure you choose the right Bluetooth? Daly goes into sleep mode. Charge or discharge a little and it'll wake up
[2023-06-22T19:14:20] Unknown: Is Daly that bad ?
[2023-06-22T19:14:21] Jason Nelson: I'm trying to check while I'm riding and charging and it shows nothing. I didn't build it I got it for a deal but I figured as long as it's charging it's running through the BMS and it should be fine, it's not something I want to play with though
[2023-06-22T19:16:33] Mirono escooters: It depends who you ask it . But it's surely not popular..
[2023-06-22T19:30:48] Unknown: How is the spinteneds on single motors ?
[2023-06-22T19:34:55] Jan: I only had good experience, almost impressive ones
[2023-06-22T19:35:17] Jan: 150A rated Daly going strong at nearly 400A peak
[2023-06-22T19:44:27] Unknown: ? Better than the flip/maker?
[2023-06-22T19:44:37] Mirono escooters: Depends wich model
[2023-06-22T19:44:41] Mirono escooters: It's like asking Samsung vs apple
[2023-06-22T19:57:08] Jedich Nixan: Samsung of course üòÅ
[2023-06-22T20:04:21] Unknown: There is only 2 on spintened that are single motor
[2023-06-22T20:04:56] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Buy 80/100 aluüëç
[2023-06-22T20:06:18] Unknown: Sorry 3
[2023-06-22T20:06:40] Unknown: Is it better than the makerbase 75200?
[2023-06-22T20:09:29] Mirono escooters: Debatable
[2023-06-22T20:09:54] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Different classes of power
[2023-06-22T20:10:05] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 75200 is 12 fet and bigger
[2023-06-22T20:10:14] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 80100 is 6 fet and smaller
[2023-06-22T20:10:34] Unknown: I have this one
[2023-06-22T20:10:59] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: We hope and waiting spintend will do 12 fet alu already
[2023-06-22T20:11:10] Unknown: But I've been informed that it doesn't have short circuit protection
[2023-06-22T20:11:11] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: That will crush 75200 from flipsky and mks
[2023-06-22T20:12:12] Unknown: I don't know if I should switch?
[2023-06-22T20:13:33] Mirono escooters: Esc? Short circuit protection?
[2023-06-22T20:37:20] Oreo huzky: Is it possible to make fieldweakening turn on at a certain speed?
[2023-06-22T20:54:35] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-06-22T21:06:36] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You need to switch it in code from duty cycle to erpms then
[2023-06-22T21:07:11] Mirono escooters: Duty makes way more sense
[2023-06-22T21:23:13] Oreo huzky: Why?
[2023-06-22T21:24:47] Mirono escooters: Apperantly im wrong
[2023-06-22T21:31:30] AK: Not necessarily wrong, in my ideal world it would be a combination of both
[2023-06-22T21:31:38] AK: where you trigger by duty after a certain speed
[2023-06-22T21:31:51] AK: otherwise it will also kick in on launches
[2023-06-22T21:32:02] Mirono escooters: Tru tru
[2023-06-22T21:32:06] Mirono escooters: That be great
[2023-06-22T21:32:13] Mirono escooters: Speed is simpler That is advanced
[2023-06-22T21:32:29] puneDir: Isnt duty is kinda speed?
[2023-06-22T21:32:35] Finn: @Mirono_escooters proper cooling now
[2023-06-22T21:32:39] AK: No, it is not
[2023-06-22T21:32:45] puneDir: Is it gas position?
[2023-06-22T21:32:53] AK: Oh wait its you
[2023-06-22T21:33:02] puneDir: What matters?
[2023-06-22T21:33:17] puneDir: Stop that shitty toxic behaviours

[2023-06-22T21:35:12] puneDir: Is field weakening duty means gas position?
[2023-06-22T21:35:20] puneDir: Or speed
[2023-06-22T21:35:28] Finn: Gas position i would guess
[2023-06-22T21:35:38] Finn: It isnt speed
[2023-06-22T21:35:40] puneDir: Than i prob fucked my motor
[2023-06-22T21:35:50] Finn: Its when fieldweaking starts
[2023-06-22T21:36:03] Finn: Why?
[2023-06-22T21:36:06] puneDir: im field weakening on zero speed nice
[2023-06-22T21:36:13] puneDir: And on hills

[2023-06-22T22:30:06] Mirono escooters: That's the wurst
[2023-06-22T22:30:20] Jan: The problem today is that people import aliexpress shit and sell it for 10x here
[2023-06-22T22:30:35] Jan: And then expensive products cannot be differentiated from good products

[2023-06-22T22:31:57] Mirono escooters: I can't make a 13s3p for 150‚Ç¨ Just not even possible. Materials are more
[2023-06-22T22:32:14] Jan: We actually have the founder of Monorim in our G30 chat, he left the company to found sharkset

[2023-06-22T22:33:18] Mirono escooters: Cheap but ok. Not much suspension, more to increase height. I myself bought it for 25? Lol. Only for height increase
[2023-06-22T22:33:26] Mirono escooters: This does not convince people
[2023-06-22T22:33:32] puneDir: Mines is so soft

[2023-06-22T22:33:44] Mirono escooters: It differs
[2023-06-22T22:33:51] puneDir: How can i change it
[2023-06-22T22:33:57] puneDir: My back is also so soft
[2023-06-22T22:34:00] Mirono escooters: Mine absorbs the big shocks from pavements and potholes so. Thats fine
[2023-06-22T22:34:06] Mirono escooters: Add a spring @VioletViolencee
[2023-06-22T22:34:20] puneDir: oh martin
[2023-06-22T22:34:23] puneDir: The suspension guy
[2023-06-22T22:34:47] Mirono escooters: üëç
[2023-06-22T22:34:50] Mirono escooters: He did it
[2023-06-22T22:34:58] Finn: <photos/photo_8791@22-06-2023_22-34-58.jpg>
[2023-06-22T22:35:09] Finn: Just want to connect my dashboard and it shut off
[2023-06-22T22:35:12] Finn: Doesnt turn on
[2023-06-22T22:35:19] Finn: Whyüòêüòê
[2023-06-22T22:35:39] Mirono escooters: Amen
[2023-06-22T22:35:49] puneDir: remove the dash and try again
[2023-06-22T22:35:54] Mirono escooters: Misconnection, 99% Short 1%
[2023-06-22T22:36:03] puneDir: i had the same once when i first bought it
[2023-06-22T22:36:40] Finn: Cant be
[2023-06-22T22:36:58] Finn: Hasnt it a short protection
[2023-06-22T22:37:08] Mirono escooters: Not on 5v line
[2023-06-22T22:37:19] Finn: Dashboard beeped
[2023-06-22T22:37:38] puneDir: Same happened
[2023-06-22T22:37:43] Finn: Bruh
[2023-06-22T22:37:56] puneDir: Disconnect wait 10 sec reconnect
[2023-06-22T22:38:48] Finn: I waited 5minutes
[2023-06-22T22:38:54] puneDir: weird
[2023-06-22T22:39:01] puneDir: maybe bad connection
[2023-06-22T22:43:23] Finn: Anyone know where the 36V connects to the upper board?
[2023-06-22T22:43:31] Finn: Maybe the circuit below is dead
[2023-06-22T22:45:20] Finn: <photos/photo_8793@22-06-2023_22-45-20.jpg>
[2023-06-22T22:45:25] Finn: This little fucker gets really hot
[2023-06-22T22:47:08] Mirono escooters: Diode, inductor
[2023-06-22T22:47:11] Mirono escooters: Or u mean that behind it
[2023-06-22T22:47:20] Mirono escooters: I doubt it a lot
[2023-06-22T22:47:26] Mirono escooters: Most likely ur top board is ded
[2023-06-22T22:47:44] Finn: I think the dc dc circuit is dead
[2023-06-22T22:47:50] Mirono escooters: 99% yes
[2023-06-22T22:47:53] Mirono escooters: Send in for repair
[2023-06-22T22:47:54] Finn: That big thing
[2023-06-22T22:47:55] Finn: Idk
[2023-06-22T22:47:59] Mirono escooters: Inductor
[2023-06-22T22:48:00] Finn: Spool
[2023-06-22T22:48:05] Mirono escooters: Spoel yes
[2023-06-22T22:48:30] Finn: I dont see anything blown or black
[2023-06-22T22:49:01] Mirono escooters: Not always it is so simple
[2023-06-22T22:49:06] Mirono escooters: I'm betting my money on 5v /12v rail
[2023-06-22T22:49:19] Finn: Where are they
[2023-06-22T22:49:23] Finn: I want to measure it
[2023-06-22T22:49:43] Mirono escooters: How are you measuring a chip
[2023-06-22T22:49:54] Finn: What you meam
[2023-06-22T22:49:55] Mirono escooters: Oh well Beep boop mode and check 12v Gnd 5v gnd Etcetera
[2023-06-22T22:49:58] Mirono escooters: Pinout on wires
[2023-06-22T22:50:02] Finn: Yes
[2023-06-22T22:50:04] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-06-22T22:50:09] Mirono escooters: Do it on Connector
[2023-06-22T22:50:11] Finn: Ooh
[2023-06-22T22:50:11] Finn: Okay
[2023-06-22T22:50:13] Finn: Yeah
[2023-06-22T22:50:23] Mirono escooters: Makes more sense no?
[2023-06-22T22:50:38] Finn: I thought there were one main line
[2023-06-22T22:50:53] Finn: Bc between the connectors are condensators
[2023-06-22T22:51:15] Mirono escooters: No no, you check every rail
[2023-06-22T22:52:39] Finn: Okay
[2023-06-22T22:52:43] Finn: 5V is dead
[2023-06-22T22:52:50] Mirono escooters: :)
[2023-06-22T22:52:51] Finn: Shorted
[2023-06-22T22:53:00] Mirono escooters: Follow traces or make educated guesses
[2023-06-22T22:53:06] Finn: Bro
[2023-06-22T22:53:13] Finn: Arent these 5 layer pcbs
[2023-06-22T22:53:20] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_8794@22-06-2023_22-53-20.jpg>
[2023-06-22T22:53:32] Mirono escooters: Well, you go beep boop around while guessing how traces go
[2023-06-22T22:53:50] Mirono escooters: I'd guess the right one but. Don't count me on it
[2023-06-22T22:53:58] Mirono escooters: Try smiling very cute to @Mltra
[2023-06-22T22:54:01] Mirono escooters: He problably knows
[2023-06-22T22:54:10] Finn: üòäüòä
[2023-06-22T22:54:46] Finn: <photos/photo_8795@22-06-2023_22-54-46.jpg>
[2023-06-22T22:55:27] Mirono escooters: Is your 3.3v ok? If 3.3 dies sometimes 5 joins
[2023-06-22T22:56:07] Mirono escooters: Are you sure a small chip like the one I circled is not getting hot?
[2023-06-22T22:56:14] Mirono escooters: It would be weird to only see inductor heat up
[2023-06-22T22:56:44] Mirono escooters: How to find dead chip on Xiaomi Apply 5v psu to 5v pin Current limit off Power on Follow the smoke
[2023-06-22T22:56:51] Mirono escooters: (don't do this)
[2023-06-22T22:57:07] Finn: Yes
[2023-06-22T22:57:12] Finn: Its alive
[2023-06-22T22:57:24] Finn: Doesnt short to ground or 5v
[2023-06-22T22:57:32] Mirono escooters: Ok
[2023-06-22T22:57:34] puneDir: Why its dead anyways
[2023-06-22T22:57:36] Finn: My fingee burned
[2023-06-22T22:57:47] Mirono escooters: On a chip? A inductor is not a chip
[2023-06-22T22:57:51] Finn: Nah
[2023-06-22T22:57:59] Mirono escooters: And u went over the whole board?
[2023-06-22T22:58:21] Finn: I lean over the board and noticed the heat comming uo
[2023-06-22T22:58:24] Finn: From this area
[2023-06-22T22:58:34] Finn: I touched the spool and it was very hot
[2023-06-22T22:58:43] Mirono escooters: Such small chips make little heat Go with finger over PCB/ find a thermal camera
[2023-06-22T22:58:43] Finn: Should i try powering it uo
[2023-06-22T22:58:51] Mirono escooters: To find your issue yes
[2023-06-22T22:58:52] Finn: I have a thermal gun
[2023-06-22T22:58:55] Mirono escooters: Ah well
[2023-06-22T22:58:55] Finn: Let me get it
[2023-06-22T22:59:02] Mirono escooters: Power it up, turn board on. Record
[2023-06-22T22:59:03] Finn: But its amazon basic
[2023-06-22T22:59:05] Finn: Lol
[2023-06-22T22:59:09] Finn: Not camera
[2023-06-22T22:59:09] Mirono escooters: Don't let it hit high temps, and see hotspot
[2023-06-22T22:59:13] Finn: Ye
[2023-06-22T22:59:17] Mirono escooters: I doubt it has enough resolution
[2023-06-22T22:59:38] Finn: <photos/photo_8796@22-06-2023_22-59-38.jpg>
[2023-06-22T22:59:49] Finn: Yeah
[2023-06-22T22:59:59] Mirono escooters: Rofl
[2023-06-22T23:00:03] Mirono escooters: Try it out and see
[2023-06-22T23:00:06] Finn: For motor tesring
[2023-06-22T23:00:10] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-06-22T23:00:19] Mirono escooters: I've got a flir and that's Rlly bottom line for pcbs and stuff
[2023-06-22T23:00:22] Mirono escooters: Resolution goes diwn
[2023-06-22T23:01:13] Finn: Only the spool
[2023-06-22T23:01:25] Finn: I could also go to my work and ask therr
[2023-06-22T23:01:31] Mirono escooters: Kinda impossible Did it die? Can u test it? Problably not .
[2023-06-22T23:01:31] Finn: They have that kind of equipment
[2023-06-22T23:01:35] Mirono escooters: I'd do that
[2023-06-22T23:01:40] Mirono escooters: Or beep boop to chip
[2023-06-22T23:01:43] Finn: Yeah
[2023-06-22T23:01:48] Finn: The little 6pin?
[2023-06-22T23:01:52] Finn: Did you got the part number
[2023-06-22T23:02:03] Mirono escooters: Well, many exist
[2023-06-22T23:02:09] Mirono escooters: Beep boop to find wich is 5v one
[2023-06-22T23:02:15] Finn: 1BJD
[2023-06-22T23:02:25] Mirono escooters: Tps56200 is a option As are 50000 others
[2023-06-22T23:02:27] Finn: Or you mean the dc dx converter
[2023-06-22T23:02:35] Finn: Chip
[2023-06-22T23:02:44] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-06-22T23:02:53] Mirono escooters: A inductor is easier And it's 90% not the cause
[2023-06-22T23:02:55] Finn: <photos/photo_8797@22-06-2023_23-02-55.jpg>
[2023-06-22T23:02:59] Mirono escooters: Something is just pulling power
[2023-06-22T23:03:07] Mirono escooters: If I'm right that's your 12v
[2023-06-22T23:03:19] Mirono escooters: y8501 or relevant
[2023-06-22T23:04:03] Finn: <photos/photo_8798@22-06-2023_23-04-03.jpg>
[2023-06-22T23:04:24] Mirono escooters: Is that findable on googl?
[2023-06-22T23:04:56] Mirono escooters: I'm genius
[2023-06-22T23:04:58] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_8799@22-06-2023_23-04-58.jpg>
[2023-06-22T23:05:02] Mirono escooters: I was right üôä
[2023-06-22T23:05:40] Finn: <photos/photo_8800@22-06-2023_23-05-40.jpg>
[2023-06-22T23:06:02] Mirono escooters: But thats 12v You said 5
[2023-06-22T23:06:09] Mirono escooters: 5 is one of the smaller chips
[2023-06-22T23:06:35] Finn: <photos/photo_8801@22-06-2023_23-06-35.jpg>
[2023-06-22T23:06:44] Finn: Is that just the input voltage
[2023-06-22T23:06:57] Finn: Yes
[2023-06-22T23:06:58] Finn: Okay
[2023-06-22T23:07:02] Mirono escooters: Input range
[2023-06-22T23:07:12] Mirono escooters: But why we looking at this?
[2023-06-22T23:07:15] Finn: Naj
[2023-06-22T23:07:20] Finn: Iknow its 12v
[2023-06-22T23:07:48] Finn: <photos/photo_8802@22-06-2023_23-07-48.jpg>
[2023-06-22T23:07:54] Finn: 18JD
[2023-06-22T23:14:05] Finn: So in + and in - are shorted
[2023-06-22T23:15:45] Mirono escooters: F
[2023-06-22T23:16:03] Mirono escooters: You found it
[2023-06-22T23:16:29] Finn: I mean it could just be any other part
[2023-06-22T23:17:25] Finn: Itd just that thr 5v and gnd are going there. Without any input voltage there cant be an output so i guess its something different
[2023-06-22T23:17:40] Finn: Any other buck converter is shorted too
[2023-06-22T23:18:19] Mirono escooters: Na, im pretty sure it's dead
[2023-06-22T23:18:29] Finn: All 3?
[2023-06-22T23:18:32] Mirono escooters: Chip internally shorted .
[2023-06-22T23:18:45] Finn: I could desolder it tomorrow with a heat gun
[2023-06-22T23:18:54] Mirono escooters: Yes and then see..
[2023-06-22T23:18:55] Finn: And try if it turns on
[2023-06-22T23:19:57] Mirono escooters: It wont
[2023-06-22T23:20:05] Mirono escooters: 5v is needed for 3.3v and MCU
[2023-06-22T23:23:47] Finn: Yes but arent these three only for the external ports
[2023-06-22T23:23:55] Finn: On the top there are two more
[2023-06-22T23:24:15] Mirono escooters: Dont think so
[2023-06-22T23:24:24] Mirono escooters: But I haven't had a 75100 alu pcb yet.
[2023-06-22T23:24:24] Finn: I would guess the exrernal can handle more power then the mcu
[2023-06-22T23:24:35] Mirono escooters: Obviously
[2023-06-22T23:24:45] Finn: Pain as fuck
[2023-06-22T23:25:03] Finn: I will go tomorrow to the lab where i work
[2023-06-22T23:25:11] Finn: Maybe there i can find out more
[2023-06-22T23:25:50] Mirono escooters: Ok
[2023-06-22T23:40:08] Medhi Cantin: <video_file>
[2023-06-22T23:40:13] Medhi Cantin: üëåüèªüëåüèª
[2023-06-22T23:43:51] Finn: @Mirono_escooters i know someone st my work who works as an hardware developer. Maybe he can help me outüòÇüòÇ
[2023-06-22T23:44:14] Konstantin: If not thermal camera, you can you paper from shop...cash receipt
[2023-06-22T23:46:45] Finn: Yeah heat paper
[2023-06-22T23:48:07] Konstantin: Sad , fets survive? Its https://www.lcsc.com/mobile/product-detail/Current-Sensing-Amplifiers_Texas-Instruments-INA181A1IDBVR_C2058943.html
[2023-06-22T23:48:24] Finn: I guess dc dc
[2023-06-22T23:48:29] Konstantin: Supply from 3.3v if I remember correctly
[2023-06-22T23:50:36] Konstantin: 5v and 3.3 || from 12v Like 100-12 > 12>5 100-12 > 12>3.3 Usually, like on m365 85-12 > 12-5 > 5-3.3
[2023-06-22T23:50:58] Mirono escooters: Thats weird design choice
[2023-06-22T23:52:16] Konstantin: 50/50 Chip use 3.3v 5v use holls, can, on 75200 oamps
[2023-06-22T23:53:10] Konstantin: On 5v suppressor rarely, but died
[2023-06-22T23:53:39] Finn: Hm..
[2023-06-22T23:53:55] Finn: I mean if 5V is dead 3.3 is also
[2023-06-22T23:54:06] Konstantin: No
[2023-06-22T23:54:20] Finn: Yes if they choose 5 - 3.3
[2023-06-22T23:54:22] Konstantin: They in parallel after 12v
[2023-06-22T23:54:31] Finn: On the alupcb?
[2023-06-22T23:54:35] Finn: Okay
[2023-06-22T23:54:52] Konstantin: It's y, like on m365...
[2023-06-22T23:55:10] Finn: Yeah you wrote thatüòÖ
[2023-06-22T23:55:27] Konstantin: 4 point for +12v
[2023-06-22T23:55:49] Konstantin: On 75100the same
[2023-06-22T23:55:49] Finn: I would guess the caps on my dashboard board blew the 5V buck convertets
[2023-06-22T23:56:33] puneDir: I use arduino dash
[2023-06-22T23:56:35] Finn: I followed the guide from 1zuna for the m365 dashboard wiring and as soon as i turned on and plugged it in it birned
[2023-06-22T23:57:12] puneDir: lol
[2023-06-22T23:57:22] puneDir: Use arduino dash
[2023-06-22T23:57:25] puneDir: Its better
[2023-06-22T23:57:28] Finn: Ok

[2023-06-23T00:01:29] Finn: Ooh so there are fuses
[2023-06-23T00:01:39] Konstantin: <photos/photo_8805@23-06-2023_00-01-39.jpg>
[2023-06-23T00:01:49] Finn: I will check tomorrow
[2023-06-23T00:01:51] Konstantin: Shorted ?
[2023-06-23T00:02:02] Finn: But why does the spool gets so hot
[2023-06-23T00:02:07] Finn: Doesnt make sense
[2023-06-23T00:02:15] Konstantin: Over load...
[2023-06-23T00:02:25] Finn: Of no load?
[2023-06-23T00:02:51] Finn: Isnt the spool in series of 12V to get a soft current flow
[2023-06-23T00:02:53] Konstantin: If some shorted, they power consumption to hi...
[2023-06-23T05:44:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: no we don't want our scooters to look like Frankenstein
[2023-06-23T05:48:49] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and that's a little misleading, because it's very very unlike due to this cause and it was working before on his other ESC. I rather guess it was hardware defect or his temp sensor that he shorts to body of scooter.
[2023-06-23T06:56:06] AK: No, it is the script
[2023-06-23T06:56:19] AK: Explodes when you klick upload

[2023-06-23T07:40:10] Mirono escooters: Lol i hate that
[2023-06-23T10:10:58] Finn: I think its the caps 100%
[2023-06-23T10:11:26] Finn: The vesc was running when i plugged in the dashboard. Maybe i should have done it before the power up of the vesc
[2023-06-23T10:18:35] Mirono escooters: I seriously doubt this
[2023-06-23T10:19:01] Mirono escooters: Do you know how small the caps on dash are? The little uf is not killing that. Have some perspective of size.
[2023-06-23T11:33:18] Mihail: Maybe the device Im developing for my university thesis would be of help. I plan to release it as open source hardware after I present it. That would be after about a month. Ive sent it in this group a while back
[2023-06-23T11:33:18] Mihail: <photos/photo_8807@23-06-2023_11-33-18.jpg>

[2023-06-23T11:33:55] Mirono escooters: Ayo
[2023-06-23T11:34:19] Mirono escooters: It talks to BMS too?
[2023-06-23T11:34:36] Mirono escooters: It's spintends board but better
[2023-06-23T11:35:49] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Ewwwww
[2023-06-23T11:36:08] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: you invented the wheel
[2023-06-23T11:36:16] Mirono escooters: What
[2023-06-23T11:42:21] Mihail: Yes, it has a few serial ports, canbus, 4 analog inputs, OneWire input and onboard regulators for 12,5 and 3.3 volts, so that the controller regulators are not in risk of overload or short. It would be open source and everything could be customised. Spintend's adc is more plug-and-play type solution. Just have to have someone write software because the one I wrote is customised for my needs.
[2023-06-23T11:42:21] Mihail: Oh yeah and i2c bus for screens etc.
[2023-06-23T11:43:36] AK: The only reason to talk to bms is obsoleted in 6.05
[2023-06-23T11:43:43] AK: Regen is configurable by voltage
[2023-06-23T11:48:51] Mihail: My implementation behaves like the original dash, I am using the m365 dashboard app to check battery parameters and voltages. The bms is flashed with BoToX's custom firmware that emulates xiaomi bms. Ive set the cruise toggle to activate zero-start, which can also be accessed without the app with 3 button clicks. Speaking of button, the pcb also has a copy of xiaomi's enable circuit and power button behaves like the original. The error beeps are also present and Ive translated the vesc errors to xiaomi original error codes. Ive also set the blink interval on the rear stop light to change based on the applied brake pressure.
[2023-06-23T11:49:50] AK: I am not commenting on your pcb, it certainly has features useful for some people, and sounds like a great thing
[2023-06-23T11:50:25] AK: It was a general comment, since regen can be quickly shutoff now, for the vesc itself there is no reason to talk to the bms anymore in my opinion
[2023-06-23T11:51:10] Mihail: Yeah that vesc option is great. Ive set it to stop regen over 4.1 per cell
[2023-06-23T11:52:06] Mihail: I was planning to add it to my project but then saw it added in the vesc software, which is a better and faster solution
[2023-06-23T11:52:34] Zak: Which dashboard you using?
[2023-06-23T11:56:35] Mirono escooters: I love u
[2023-06-23T11:58:52] Mihail: Why not compile it yourself?
[2023-06-23T11:59:48] AK: why tf would you compile it
[2023-06-23T12:00:11] AK: Just press download :D
[2023-06-23T12:00:39] AK: Now that is not true
[2023-06-23T12:00:47] AK: Latest beta always opens everything
[2023-06-23T12:00:57] AK: but the popup is really annoying
[2023-06-23T12:01:29] AK: I only started playing with vesc on 6.0 beta, so no idea about times before that
[2023-06-23T12:04:11] Mihail: Because my vesc is self-developed and has custom configuration for the current amplifiers.
[2023-06-23T12:04:23] AK: oh well
[2023-06-23T14:04:57] Ion: Got the spiny V2, I'll install it on my 10+ and see how it is. Feels high quality
[2023-06-23T14:05:53] Mirono escooters: Are the grooves to put rubber in? For diff handlebar sizes
[2023-06-23T14:06:01] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_8810@23-06-2023_14-06-01.jpg>
[2023-06-23T14:07:44] Ion: There were no rubber inserts included. Maybe they are there so that the aluminum can flex when tightening it?
[2023-06-23T14:11:24] Mirono escooters: ü§¶ that makes sense
[2023-06-23T14:17:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: You liked the message too @Mirono_escooters

[2023-06-23T15:20:17] Mirono escooters: Bolt down
[2023-06-23T15:22:11] Awyba: yea but i would prefer to not drill any holes
[2023-06-23T15:22:41] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Make heatsink like original Xiaomi ESC or make Alu bottom plate
[2023-06-23T15:28:03] Mirono escooters: We have 3d files
[2023-06-23T15:28:07] Mirono escooters: Any workshop can make it

[2023-06-23T18:42:59] Mirono escooters: Blue and green
[2023-06-23T18:43:02] Mirono escooters: It doesn't Rlly matter
[2023-06-23T18:43:07] Mirono escooters: And then 2 phase wires
[2023-06-23T19:01:57] Ofek üê•: Thanks! Looks promising! I started learning LISP for the same purpose but busy time at work changed my plan.. I'll probably test it in the future, after I'll order a display (and 6.05 won't be beta)

[2023-06-23T21:58:37] Ion: I still need to play around with settings and position but it feels nice to use Only thing is, a normal thumb throttle feels more precise and controllable over bumps and potholes. I find it more difficult to hold the spiny in a fixed position on uneven roads . Normal?

[2023-06-24T14:06:08] AK: It is not, simply because all of those people have stranded wire
[2023-06-24T14:06:30] AK: If you hydraulically press the strands in a hull, then could be, depending on currents
[2023-06-24T14:06:32] Medhi Cantin: I only had Anderson at home

[2023-06-27T17:53:44] Pablo Fernandez: If you are making a Racing scooter almost nothing Will finish as stock. Just decent chasis and 11inch
[2023-06-27T17:58:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: So good or no good Sonken 3mm
[2023-06-27T18:01:50] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes most
[2023-06-27T18:02:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: Good üëç
[2023-06-27T18:02:26] Finn: Before afterüòÇ

[2023-06-27T18:03:22] Mirono escooters: I'm confused
[2023-06-27T18:03:42] Martin Kaktits: Heyo. Im installing flipsky 75100 now and im having some problems with temp sensor. it shows -1C while it should show ~24C i troubleshooted it and the temperature sensor R reads ok with multimetee when wires not connected to esc. But connected to esc the R drops to 2.5k (should be closer to 100k) It.. works. Reacts to me heating motor with heatgun, but just 25C less than should
[2023-06-27T18:06:23] Martin Kaktits: i have 75100 and ininstalled the no limits fw
[2023-06-27T18:06:31] Martin Kaktits: from here https://github.com/vedderb/vesc_fw_archive/blob/main/6.00/75_100_V2/VESC_default_no_hw_limits.bin
[2023-06-27T18:07:10] Martin Kaktits: its blue board and im pretty sure this is the correct one(?)
[2023-06-27T18:07:27] Finn: About what
[2023-06-27T18:07:59] Mirono escooters: Before and after
[2023-06-27T18:08:03] Mirono escooters: You welded the hole?
[2023-06-27T18:08:07] Finn: Yes
[2023-06-27T18:08:17] Finn: Because i drilled it open in order to let rwd adapter fit
[2023-06-27T18:08:21] Mirono escooters: Ah
[2023-06-27T18:29:21] AK: sec
[2023-06-27T18:30:44] Martin Kaktits: i can force it to show coreect temp by manually setting this.. but that shouldnt be like that
[2023-06-27T18:36:02] AK: These two might mbe swapped
[2023-06-27T18:36:10] AK: doublecheck
[2023-06-27T18:37:51] Martin Kaktits: T and 5v ?? swapped?
[2023-06-27T18:37:54] Martin Kaktits: well, hall sensors work
[2023-06-27T18:38:34] Martin Kaktits: a u mean the tiny resistors?
[2023-06-27T18:38:35] Martin Kaktits: hm
[2023-06-27T18:47:52] Martin Kaktits: thats not something i can test right now. But if they are indeed messed up - is it oke to leave it as is, but accept error? or it can mess up something else
[2023-06-27T18:59:13] AK: Yeah, it is
[2023-06-27T19:22:20] Martin Kaktits: can i.. force correct temp reading by messing with the sensor settings?
[2023-06-27T23:13:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Front motor not connected. No brakes. Temporary battery. Enough for a test ride üòÇ
[2023-06-27T23:14:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @aka13 thanks btw I had a look at your script to update mine for NineBot protocol and worked well. It was basically just a new header and everything shifted by one but yeah saved me quite some time
[2023-06-27T23:15:25] AK: I can transfer you the repo, if you need it, I won't be updating it any longer I think
[2023-06-27T23:15:43] AK: Slowly butchering the g30, and no intent on a new one tbh
[2023-06-27T23:16:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I already have a fork of your repo which I will keep updated.
[2023-06-27T23:16:28] AK: Ah, very nice
[2023-06-27T23:17:40] AK: I don't like the g30 at all
[2023-06-27T23:17:53] AK: It's either you have no suspension at all, which is retarded
[2023-06-27T23:18:00] AK: Sorry, it just is
[2023-06-27T23:18:16] AK: Unless its a track setup, or you weight 50 kg
[2023-06-27T23:18:41] AK: Or you lift it up 10 cm, and it then has bad center of weight
[2023-06-27T23:19:14] AK: And steers badly
[2023-06-27T23:19:35] AK: Not sure how I would like the snsc frame, where the suspension is integrated
[2023-06-27T23:19:52] AK: It steers badly when lifted, which you are going to do with any suspension
[2023-06-27T23:20:12] AK: Yes
[2023-06-27T23:20:42] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: By the way, do you have a model of a rectangle in Max's plug in which you can install secondary charging port?
[2023-06-27T23:21:07] AK: Yes, check groups for stls
[2023-06-27T23:21:22] AK: For us it's not an option bc of vins
[2023-06-27T23:21:40] AK: I know a couple of shizos who registered vins from voi
[2023-06-27T23:21:46] AK: That's just asking for trouble
[2023-06-27T23:22:04] AK: When they do an inventarisation and mass report stolen/lost to Police
[2023-06-27T23:22:55] AK: Both
[2023-06-27T23:23:09] AK: Yeah sure, I am gonn do plate fraud for a mediocre small frame
[2023-06-27T23:23:55] AK: Next suggestion on the "reasonable things to do list" will propably taking hostages and demanding segway to release a private version of the snsc
[2023-06-27T23:23:59] AK: üòÇ
[2023-06-27T23:24:25] AK: Tbh, the only scoot I might consider would be the gt1 frame
[2023-06-27T23:24:42] AK: Yeah, funny, I bought the vsett two months before the gt1
[2023-06-27T23:24:59] AK: But if I had to decide right now, it would be a tough choice
[2023-06-27T23:25:06] AK: Segway is all proprietary
[2023-06-27T23:25:23] AK: Proprietary brakes, proprietary motors, errything has to be special
[2023-06-27T23:25:29] AK: I really don't like that
[2023-06-27T23:25:48] AK: From a personal preference standpoint
[2023-06-27T23:28:08] AK: Think of me when you order the swingarms
[2023-06-27T23:28:20] AK: maybe they will make a better deal or smth
[2023-06-27T23:29:28] Pablo Fernandez: You have to dm them and they usually lower the price
[2023-06-27T23:29:45] Pablo Fernandez: Upgrading to 11" would be perfect
[2023-06-27T23:31:15] Pablo Fernandez: my only fear is something with the estructure not being as good for 11 inches
[2023-06-27T23:33:19] Pablo Fernandez: totally agree with the audio
[2023-06-27T23:34:15] Pablo Fernandez: yeah, looks almost the same, a bit thicker on the bottom
[2023-06-27T23:34:23] Pablo Fernandez: never seen a problem with that part
[2023-06-28T17:27:23] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: any ideas how I can fix my ebrake being so unsmooth? Tried a lot already, recalibration, changing observer, different sensor modes, bemf on off (that fixed it on a friends scooter) but nope
[2023-06-28T17:27:46] Mirono escooters: Is your phase vs batt amps very different?
[2023-06-28T17:42:27] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes
[2023-06-28T17:42:30] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: why
[2023-06-28T17:42:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It's like -15A batt brake current and -110A motor brake current
[2023-06-28T17:45:39] Mirono escooters: Up your batt current
[2023-06-28T17:45:42] Mirono escooters: Or lower motor brake
[2023-06-28T17:45:44] Mirono escooters: I had same issue
[2023-06-28T17:50:01] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Ok I will try
[2023-06-28T18:10:59] JPPL: -110 motor on my setups is a lot
[2023-06-28T18:13:40] Mirono escooters: Phase not
[2023-06-28T18:30:23] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: It works the same as for acceleration. Battery current gives more strength on high speed, phase gives more strength on low speed
[2023-06-28T18:32:39] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Vedder himself said that brakes are more important than battery cells life. I have an opinion that it is better to make good mechanical brakes and have a combination of both types, where the mechanics are superior to the electric brake
[2023-06-28T18:32:56] Mirono escooters: I avoid ebbrake at all costs
[2023-06-28T18:33:03] Mirono escooters: It's backup/ much downhill
[2023-06-28T18:33:09] Mirono escooters: Mechanical above everything
[2023-06-28T19:01:14] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes I have no mechanicals yet
[2023-06-28T19:01:34] Mirono escooters: Bruhhh
[2023-06-28T19:01:39] Finn: Lmao
[2023-06-28T19:02:16] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, -15A is like absolutely useless above 40km/h, but at low speed it's very strong. I just need to fix this weird stuttering, but I will try to change few values till it works
[2023-06-28T19:03:06] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yea, stuttering is weird
[2023-06-28T19:03:07] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes that's the plan. I will keep my ebrake throttle just in case, as well as put mechanical (and disconnect them from dash).
[2023-06-28T19:05:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I said I would mount them today but eh I was too lazy üòê
[2023-06-28T19:06:09] Mirono escooters: Till u have a serious aciddent
[2023-06-28T19:07:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: eh ebrake doing its job well to get to school. Just for one day or smth
[2023-06-28T19:13:53] Mirono escooters: Doesn't matter, you can die in 1 day
[2023-06-28T19:14:10] Mirono escooters: I've stopped riding beta scooters, and just waited till it was perfect
[2023-06-28T19:14:16] Mirono escooters: Too much close calls

[2023-06-28T19:16:38] Pablo Fernandez: some electrical tape
[2023-06-28T19:16:59] Pablo Fernandez: are you ok or had an injuries??
[2023-06-28T19:25:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: This is xiaomi?
[2023-06-28T19:26:40] puneDir: Yes
[2023-06-28T19:26:45] puneDir: I was going with 5
[2023-06-28T19:26:57] Mirono escooters: I hope 5kmh and not 5ppl
[2023-06-28T19:27:02] puneDir: 5 kmh
[2023-06-28T19:27:03] Mirono escooters: How does that snap at 5kmh
[2023-06-28T19:27:09] puneDir: i have no idea
[2023-06-28T19:27:17] puneDir: <photos/photo_8835@28-06-2023_19-27-17.jpg>
[2023-06-28T19:27:20] puneDir: Were still making shit stuff
[2023-06-28T19:27:25] Mirono escooters: Seems casting was bad
[2023-06-28T19:27:30] Mirono escooters: Jank it together and warranty
[2023-06-28T19:27:33] puneDir: My friends bicycle going to snap soon üíÄ
[2023-06-28T19:27:39] Pablo Fernandez: i mean tbf i dont think speed is the main factor when snapping it should be a factory issue
[2023-06-28T19:27:52] Mirono escooters: Yes, I haven't seen many Xiaomi snap
[2023-06-28T19:27:55] puneDir: Everything has an end
[2023-06-28T19:27:56] Mirono escooters: And that was when jumping and shit
[2023-06-28T19:28:02] Mirono escooters: This is too soon and unlogical
[2023-06-28T19:28:06] puneDir: I still remember the day i opened the box
[2023-06-28T19:28:11] puneDir: It was 6 months ago
[2023-06-28T19:28:31] puneDir: I still have the box even the wraps
[2023-06-28T19:28:40] Mirono escooters: Warranty it
[2023-06-28T19:28:55] puneDir: They will reject
[2023-06-28T19:29:03] Mirono escooters: Make it stock
[2023-06-28T19:29:06] Mirono escooters: ". "
[2023-06-28T19:29:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: This profile is extruded , not casted
[2023-06-28T19:29:34] Mirono escooters: Oh wow
[2023-06-28T19:29:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: At least, xiaomi use extruded profiles , clone maybe casted
[2023-06-28T19:29:51] Pablo Fernandez: oh you also have a parrot
[2023-06-28T19:29:51] Mirono escooters: Clone is casted
[2023-06-28T19:30:15] Mirono escooters: Eating wire
[2023-06-28T19:30:17] Mirono escooters: Nam nam
[2023-06-28T19:30:47] Pablo Fernandez: <photos/photo_8837@28-06-2023_19-30-47.jpg>
[2023-06-28T19:30:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because technically extruding is easier, stronger, cheaper and faster for this part. But that don‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs always better, because if material is shit
[2023-06-28T19:31:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think that‚Äôs material impurities
[2023-06-28T19:31:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: Random Recycled alu

[2023-06-28T19:33:05] Mirono escooters: That shouldn't happen
[2023-06-28T19:33:25] Mirono escooters: We know ninebot g30 is 6061 alu
[2023-06-28T19:33:27] Mirono escooters: Idk Xiaomi
[2023-06-28T19:34:00] Mirono escooters: Or was it 6061 Idk, something good and pure
[2023-06-28T19:42:37] AK: This is turkey and punedir
[2023-06-28T19:42:49] AK: The frame was 99,9% abused by weight overload
[2023-06-28T19:42:53] AK: And stupid jumps
[2023-06-28T19:43:34] Mirono escooters: No, I believe him
[2023-06-28T19:44:29] AK: I believe him also, that he was riding 5kmh when it broke
[2023-06-28T19:44:43] AK: What I don't believe in, is that it was not abused before
[2023-06-28T19:47:07] Mirono escooters: I believe it
[2023-06-28T19:47:15] Mirono escooters: He put too much work in it
[2023-06-28T19:47:25] Mirono escooters: The aluminium has clear impurities marks
[2023-06-28T20:06:57] Oreo huzky: Nah I bet some hot glue and tape could fix this ü•≤
[2023-06-28T20:07:04] Mirono escooters: Ducktape
[2023-06-28T20:17:35] Jan: Is it possible to rely on e-brakes only for a 30kph max speed scooter? Can i get enough stopping power with good cells and a like 500W motor. Never really tried to use e brake but there is maybe some potential
[2023-06-28T20:19:41] Jan: Everytime you mention this i think you are this guy https://www.tiktok.com/@bosshuntingofficial/video/7231412778467118337
[2023-06-28T20:21:13] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, it can, but needs a lot of headroom for voltage spikes
[2023-06-28T20:21:28] Jan: You sure somebody would use that on a scooter? 7075 is rather expensive compared to 6061
[2023-06-28T20:21:37] Jan: ok
[2023-06-28T20:21:49] Jan: overbuilt controller then
[2023-06-28T20:22:54] Mirono escooters: Sorry, it was 6061
[2023-06-28T20:23:29] puneDir: I swear i never do stupid stuff with it
[2023-06-28T20:25:27] puneDir: I was loving it

[2023-06-28T20:27:32] puneDir: Yeah g30 is the way to go
[2023-06-28T20:28:30] puneDir: Would welding the frame work?
[2023-06-28T20:28:50] Mirono escooters: I wouldn't :/

[2023-06-28T20:35:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It's the same like hw_ubox_100_core.h, it only lowers maximum voltage.

[2023-06-28T21:58:09] Finn: Almost done
[2023-06-28T21:59:25] Noel: Hello guys, glad I found this group üëã
[2023-06-28T21:59:46] Finn: @Mirono_escooters drove fucking 40km for those connectorsüòÇ
[2023-06-28T21:59:51] Finn: Heyyy
[2023-06-28T22:00:23] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-06-28T22:00:25] Mirono escooters: Amazon brt
[2023-06-28T22:00:35] Mirono escooters: Hyy
[2023-06-28T22:00:45] puneDir: lets superglue the frame
[2023-06-28T22:00:49] puneDir: it would be fun
[2023-06-28T22:00:59] puneDir: <sticker>
[2023-06-28T22:01:57] Noel: I'm currently experiencing some minor braking problems with my 75100 + vsett10 motor on my G30D. I was hoping you might know how to fix it, but first I'll read what's been written here before ü§î
[2023-06-28T22:25:16] Noel: I guess I gotta experiment a bit more with current and maybe think about mechanical brakes for the future.. Still unsure how it'd be solved else.
[2023-06-28T22:26:37] Mirono escooters: Mechanical
[2023-06-28T22:26:41] Mirono escooters: Describe ur issue
[2023-06-28T22:27:05] Finn: Noice. Now testing
[2023-06-28T22:34:03] Noel: Well on my current setups (and even in general on vesc 75100) I always have brake rippling on my G30D and it gets quite risky sometimes. It isn't a mechanical rather software-sided problem in my pov, as the e-brake is the problem I'm experiencing with atm. Just looking for a straightforward solution onto how I could solve the e-brake rippling on the lower ends/rpm and in general. Acceleration works fine somehow (max current on both 105A, 30 A bat current, -20A max current 1C for me)
[2023-06-28T22:34:22] Mirono escooters: More phase amps for low speed braking
[2023-06-28T22:35:46] Noel: I tried 120A before, but still it ripples as before. It seems like no matter what max current I used the brake problem remains.
[2023-06-28T23:58:42] Finn: Only 70kmh with 16s. Which option should i use for observer type?
[2023-06-28T23:59:14] Finn: I get a little stuttering
[2023-06-28T23:59:48] Oreo huzky: Looks fine
[2023-06-28T23:59:55] Oreo huzky: What vesc?
[2023-06-29T00:00:08] Finn: 75100 alu
[2023-06-29T00:00:19] Konstantin: Try Ortega
[2023-06-29T00:00:20] Finn: Maybe with 20s it will get a lil faster
[2023-06-29T00:00:26] Finn: I will tomorrow
[2023-06-29T00:00:51] Finn: And max duty to 97%
[2023-06-29T00:00:51] Martin Kaktits: "only"
[2023-06-29T00:00:56] Finn: Lmao
[2023-06-29T00:01:22] Finn: Esc will not get over 30C bc of alu bottompkate
[2023-06-29T00:01:23] Martin Kaktits: i do 65kmh with 16s and vsett 10 motor
[2023-06-29T00:01:40] Oreo huzky: I think flipsky often gets stutter at high voltage
[2023-06-29T00:01:45] Finn: With fw to 40A i can get maybe 75 but not more
[2023-06-29T00:01:47] Oreo huzky: I had stutter too
[2023-06-29T00:01:50] Finn: Its makerbase
[2023-06-29T00:01:52] Finn: Lol
[2023-06-29T00:01:59] Oreo huzky: And i tried every observer
[2023-06-29T00:02:03] Finn: Nah
[2023-06-29T00:02:10] Finn: I tried mxlemming
[2023-06-29T00:02:12] Oreo huzky: Isn‚Äôt it same as flipsky
[2023-06-29T00:02:15] Finn: Tomorrow i wikk try ortega
[2023-06-29T00:03:10] Martin Kaktits: ortega more max speed. Mxlemming more low speed torque (switch awy to sensoreless as quick as u can)
[2023-06-29T00:03:30] Finn: I mean isnt sensor only for 10kmh
[2023-06-29T00:03:46] Finn: So hfi?
[2023-06-29T00:04:38] Martin Kaktits: i tought so too. But with halls up to 10kmh it was way worse than setting sensoreless switch very low (like 2kmh) and using mxlemmibg
[2023-06-29T00:05:31] Finn: Interesting. Let me try it tomorrow and see if that improves it
[2023-06-29T00:05:33] Mirono escooters: Ortega and backemf enabled
[2023-06-29T00:06:00] Finn: Wym
[2023-06-29T00:06:07] Finn: Backemf isnt that break
[2023-06-29T00:06:10] Oreo huzky: Ooof that‚Äôs maybe why I had stuttering with every observer had makerbase 75200
[2023-06-29T00:06:14] Mirono escooters: No, it's a option
[2023-06-29T00:06:21] Mirono escooters: Decoupling or SMTH it's too late for this
[2023-06-29T00:06:22] Finn: Let me try that tomorrow
[2023-06-29T00:06:26] Finn: Ooh yeah
[2023-06-29T00:06:34] Mirono escooters: And now I have em xd
[2023-06-29T00:06:39] Finn: Its set to disabked
[2023-06-29T00:06:46] Oreo huzky: Ye
[2023-06-29T00:06:57] Oreo huzky: What you gonna use them for
[2023-06-29T00:07:04] Martin Kaktits: mxlemming + quick sensoreless switch literally makes the front wheel lift a little bit. While leaving halls up to 10kmh is meeeeeh
[2023-06-29T00:07:09] Oreo huzky: 350
[2023-06-29T00:07:14] Finn: Its not stuttering. Its only little when i drive over 40kmh
[2023-06-29T00:07:16] Mirono escooters: God knows. I think my boat
[2023-06-29T00:07:23] Oreo huzky: Nice
[2023-06-29T00:07:32] Mirono escooters: First repair em
[2023-06-29T00:07:38] Mirono escooters: I'm not too sure both will work
[2023-06-29T00:07:59] puneDir: I was also getting stuttering
[2023-06-29T00:08:01] Oreo huzky: Drive two motors with one vesc
[2023-06-29T00:08:36] Mirono escooters: ha
[2023-06-29T00:08:37] Mirono escooters: Wha
[2023-06-29T00:08:57] puneDir: Wut
[2023-06-29T00:11:37] Oreo huzky: Goofy
[2023-06-29T00:39:55] Ion: That was basically the ninebot ES series (es1, es2), It was my first scooter and compared to even something like an original M365 it was BAD. Ebrake only (even at 30kph) is too slow to react. Also if controller dies, the rider may too...
[2023-06-29T00:44:00] Pablo Fernandez: still many scooters relly on having bad brakes just because they say "o e brake o o"
[2023-06-29T00:44:23] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2023-06-29T00:44:37] Pablo Fernandez: fucking up your controller and your bones, 2x1
[2023-06-29T00:44:57] Jan: <animation>
[2023-06-29T00:46:14] Jan: Could you just dump the massive energy spike from an e brake into some big caps?
[2023-06-29T00:47:47] Ion: Maybe, but the controller would still need to handle the load, right? The ninebot ES used to die (for example when braking longer / downhill) and just shut off...
[2023-06-29T00:48:18] Jan: Yes the controller needs to address this spike load
[2023-06-29T00:48:25] Jan: So no cheap shizzle üòÖ
[2023-06-29T01:25:08] Rogerio Figueiredo: Hello
[2023-06-29T01:25:13] Rogerio Figueiredo: How are you guys
[2023-06-29T01:25:28] Rogerio Figueiredo: Do you know if vesc 75100 has shared rx or TX?
[2023-06-29T06:56:45] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I have upped brake batt current to -25A and motor decreased to -70, but still not smooth so I guess this is not the issue.
[2023-06-29T06:57:02] puneDir: <photos/photo_8841@29-06-2023_06-57-02.jpg>

[2023-06-29T07:02:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Taking it to school with me today. It's eh, OK as long as I drive like driving school. üòÇ
[2023-06-29T07:03:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: definitely not good enough for an emergency braking but normal it's ok
[2023-06-29T07:04:01] puneDir: You just use regen?
[2023-06-29T07:04:50] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes at the moment I do
[2023-06-29T11:10:29] Mirono escooters: Es series is soo shit
[2023-06-29T11:15:45] Ion: What's the specs of your G30? Battery, controller, motors?
[2023-06-29T11:18:18] Finn: Good specs
[2023-06-29T11:19:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 2x 60H 22x3 Motor 2x MP2 300A VESC (second one is still in post) temporary 15S 85A from my PRO 2 (I will build 20s6p 250A very soon)
[2023-06-29T11:19:34] Mirono escooters: Hehe
[2023-06-29T11:25:25] Jan: What cells for the 20s6p?
[2023-06-29T11:26:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Molicel P42A
[2023-06-29T11:26:30] Jan: Nice looks like we get to some equal specs very soon
[2023-06-29T11:26:40] Jan: Looking forward to see your build üëå
[2023-06-29T11:27:40] Jan: Super tricky with space if everything is in the floor
[2023-06-29T11:31:55] Mirono escooters: Mp2 go brr
[2023-06-29T11:32:01] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yup but luckily ESCs are very flat and the BMS is big in width and height but that's also still ok
[2023-06-29T11:32:23] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I think I can also put GPS there as well and even bigger caps
[2023-06-29T11:32:30] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Need to order more
[2023-06-29T11:32:45] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: want at least 6000uf on each MP2
[2023-06-29T11:33:40] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: need to fit GPS too xd
[2023-06-29T11:33:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But seems there is enough space
[2023-06-29T11:35:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you use e brake I think you need it , yesüòÇ
[2023-06-29T11:36:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: <video_file>
[2023-06-29T11:47:13] Simone: did you finally try them? haha how are they?
[2023-06-29T12:07:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: Very nice discs
[2023-06-29T12:09:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: Much difference than brake stuff ?
[2023-06-29T12:13:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: hard to tell, wasn't on same scooter :/
[2023-06-29T12:25:21] Jan: You got a link to the esc?

[2023-06-29T12:52:46] Jan: whats the end thickness of the controller?
[2023-06-29T18:05:43] Yosi Moreno: Does someone know what phase mosfets are used at the 75200 flipsky ?
[2023-06-29T18:06:18] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_8842@29-06-2023_18-06-18.jpg>

[2023-06-29T18:42:33] Mirono escooters: I only need to repair 2
[2023-06-29T18:44:31] Yosi Moreno: Hhh nice mybe you can sell me 4 and send it in an envelop ? üòä
[2023-06-29T18:48:35] Mihail: Need them all
[2023-06-29T18:48:46] Mihail: I need to make 5 controllers
[2023-06-29T18:49:06] Mirono escooters: Make?
[2023-06-29T18:49:09] Mihail: Why not buy from lcsc?
[2023-06-29T18:49:11] Mirono escooters: Ohh right that was yours
[2023-06-29T18:49:59] Mihail: <photos/photo_8844@29-06-2023_18-49-59.jpg>
[2023-06-29T18:50:09] Mirono escooters: Waw
[2023-06-29T18:51:04] Mihail: First one runs great, this is the second one. Sadly I have no time to finish the rest and get my vsett 10 back on the road due to university bullshit.
[2023-06-29T18:51:27] Mirono escooters: What you study?
[2023-06-29T18:51:33] Mirono escooters: Electronical engineering?
[2023-06-29T18:51:42] Mihail: Software engineering sadly
[2023-06-29T18:52:05] Mirono escooters: O
[2023-06-29T18:52:09] Mirono escooters: And you can design that?
[2023-06-29T18:52:11] Mirono escooters: Self learned?
[2023-06-29T18:52:13] Mihail: But I work as an electronics engineer and will probably never go to software
[2023-06-29T18:52:33] Mirono escooters: Aha
[2023-06-29T18:52:41] Mihail: Mostly yes
[2023-06-29T18:52:48] Mirono escooters: Sick
[2023-06-29T18:53:31] Yosi Moreno: Thats what i will do.. just a matter of shipping fee and min quantity
[2023-06-29T18:54:43] Mihail: Shipping is super cheap. I use the cheapest option they have which was around 6 euro if I remember correctly
[2023-06-29T18:55:57] Yosi Moreno: Depends on your location
[2023-06-29T18:56:16] Mihail: Im sad their other company jlcpcb doesn't offer black 4layer pcbs for 2dollars anymore. Now they are all green and limited to 6 layer, before they had upto 8 layer for the price
[2023-06-29T21:01:23] AK: Selling the remains of my g30. Ubox 100v100a, snsc fork, segway mini cst tire,fork serviced recently. Wire harness remade, to have throttle and brake directly on the vesc. 16s7p battery from scavenged cells, about 1kwh nominal capacity. 150a ant bms. Usb xh connector on the outside for easy access to the vesc. Polyethylene slippy bottom cover. Monorim mounts present. Ubox conformal coated with Mg chem 422C. Copper heatsink to rear. Located in Berlin, german VIN. I think that 500 Eur is a fair price.

[2023-06-29T21:02:44] Finn: i would take the frame xD
[2023-06-29T21:02:47] AK: Negative
[2023-06-29T21:02:57] Mirono escooters: Sad. My friend would love the fork

[2023-06-29T22:13:16] AK: Why?
[2023-06-29T22:13:31] AK: I don't get the question, unironically
[2023-06-29T22:13:44] AK: What would be the problem in your opinion?
[2023-06-29T22:14:23] AK: It's literally the stock wheel in the picture üòÇ
[2023-06-29T22:16:09] AK: It is removable, its not mounted to the wheel
[2023-06-29T22:16:31] AK: Similar to snsc
[2023-06-29T22:16:55] AK: Usually you just take the snsc axle and drill the drum cover to accomodate it
[2023-06-29T22:17:18] AK: Just check the russian manual for the forks, it's self explanatory

[2023-06-30T11:59:14] Noel: That's my bag.
[2023-06-30T11:59:40] Noel: Mainly issuing my braking stuttering here, it really gets dangerous sometimes
[2023-06-30T12:00:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes you know I have the same issue, couldn't figure it out so far. Now installed mechanical and well, move on.
[2023-06-30T12:06:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Oohh ok ,just felt better to ask Before something moves or makes some prob
[2023-06-30T12:30:26] Noel: How did you manage to install a rear mech. brake?
[2023-06-30T12:31:39] AA: I got a fipsky 75100 for my xiaomi looking for a heatsink, Any recommendations?
[2023-06-30T12:35:59] Finn: Alu or box
[2023-06-30T12:36:07] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Front
[2023-06-30T12:38:58] Mirono escooters: Custom bracket or direct bolt
[2023-06-30T12:39:38] AA: No heatsinks that can be adapted and used?
[2023-06-30T12:39:51] Mirono escooters: I have drawings for one in Xiaomi
[2023-06-30T12:40:03] Mirono escooters: But it's very custom made and needs a cnc
[2023-06-30T12:40:08] AA: I have a xiaomi as well, care to share?
[2023-06-30T12:40:21] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse.. my designs are free
[2023-06-30T12:40:22] Mirono escooters: Wait
[2023-06-30T12:40:26] AA: I can find a cnc machine or something shouldn‚Äôt be a restriction

[2023-06-30T12:41:18] Mirono escooters: The holes on design are for mp2 But it's easily changeable for 75100
[2023-06-30T12:41:31] Mirono escooters: If you give me dimensions and screw spacing I can do it
[2023-06-30T12:42:21] AA: I will measure it and send you in private
[2023-06-30T12:42:26] AA: Thanks!

[2023-06-30T12:43:01] AA: Need thermal paste?
[2023-06-30T12:43:22] Mirono escooters: Meh. U reach silicon limit of to220 anyway
[2023-06-30T12:44:14] AA: Both sides paste? Frame -> paste ‚Äî> bracket -> paste -> vesc?
[2023-06-30T12:44:27] Mirono escooters: Delete the bracket
[2023-06-30T12:44:33] Mirono escooters: Bolt them directly to heatsink
[2023-06-30T12:44:37] Mirono escooters: With thermal pad for to220
[2023-06-30T12:44:49] AA: Which heatsink? Stock one?
[2023-06-30T12:44:59] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-06-30T12:45:03] Mirono escooters: Yeetus deletus
[2023-06-30T12:45:04] AA: Ok great
[2023-06-30T12:45:13] Mirono escooters: @kawaiinekololis show it
[2023-06-30T12:45:23] Mirono escooters: He's the mvp
[2023-06-30T12:45:40] AA: So custom bracket that fits the stock heatsink ok awesome
[2023-06-30T12:45:51] AA: Great stuff starting to align üòÇ
[2023-06-30T12:46:22] Mirono escooters: If you want the best thats the best
[2023-06-30T12:46:46] AA: Btw software wise, I saw someone added a python based diy attachment to the flipsky 75100 for better control
[2023-06-30T12:47:28] AK: Buy the shittiest cheapest controller with to220 cheapest fets @ invest controller price in a custom heatsink, while your whole scooter is made from aluminum
[2023-06-30T12:47:30] AA: Needed? What software does the vesc support? I am more than adequate with software development so I can manage with any language üòÇ
[2023-06-30T12:47:35] AK: Can't make this shit up
[2023-06-30T12:48:33] Mirono escooters: Sowwy
[2023-06-30T12:49:01] Mirono escooters: I've got free access to a cnc and time to spend.. so..
[2023-06-30T12:49:11] Mirono escooters: The heatsink is for mp2 but can be adapted
[2023-06-30T12:49:16] Mirono escooters: I'd get a mp2 üòç
[2023-06-30T12:57:28] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: This?
[2023-06-30T12:57:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <photos/photo_8855@30-06-2023_12-57-29.jpg>
[2023-06-30T12:57:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <photos/photo_8856@30-06-2023_12-57-29.jpg>
[2023-06-30T12:57:46] Mirono escooters: Ja
[2023-06-30T12:59:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It's better than drilling holes into your scooter frame ü§∑ I used the exact same concept for 75100, Ubox, 75100 Alu PCB, MP2 etc
[2023-06-30T13:00:45] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-06-30T13:10:05] puneDir: @Mirono_escooters do you have something for g30?
[2023-06-30T13:10:22] Mirono escooters: Maybe later when I start mine
[2023-06-30T13:10:31] Mirono escooters: But 75200 is problably just gonna be clamped
[2023-06-30T13:10:33] puneDir: How can i mount the escs to g30
[2023-06-30T13:10:37] puneDir: Any ideas
[2023-06-30T13:10:40] Mirono escooters: Depends wich
[2023-06-30T13:10:45] puneDir: 75100
[2023-06-30T13:10:46] Mirono escooters: Clamp, thermal glue, bla
[2023-06-30T13:10:54] Mirono escooters: Time to design a heatsink
[2023-06-30T13:11:01] puneDir: I shouldnt bolt the√∂
[2023-06-30T13:11:09] Mirono escooters: Boltign is best
[2023-06-30T13:28:13] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Make Alu bottom plate :)
[2023-06-30T13:28:40] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: or cut away some of the original g30 ESC case
[2023-06-30T13:28:42] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and mount it there
[2023-06-30T13:45:49] AK: Don't see how it's better
[2023-06-30T13:46:01] AK: I'd say its worse
[2023-06-30T13:46:27] AK: What is the problem with drilling a hole?
[2023-06-30T13:46:44] AK: It's worse in every way
[2023-06-30T13:48:28] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: eh I don't like holes in my scooter frame
[2023-06-30T13:48:38] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: rather have a proper mounting way
[2023-06-30T13:52:28] Mirono escooters: Yeah if mounting holes avaible why not
[2023-06-30T14:07:50] Thierry: Can I bridge adc1 of esc1 and esc2 to have a single throttle that drive two esc? Meaning using 3.3v from esc1 on adc1 of esc2. (I don't what to use can)
[2023-06-30T14:08:20] Finn: Why you dont wanna use can??
[2023-06-30T14:09:02] Finn: Its easier then this
[2023-06-30T14:11:55] Thierry: Because I have a particluar config
[2023-06-30T14:12:13] Finn: Hm..
[2023-06-30T14:12:22] Finn: You mean lisp script?
[2023-06-30T14:14:02] Thierry: No I don't use lisp
[2023-06-30T14:15:00] Thierry: I'm not sure if I can use 3.3v from another vesc and if I also must connect both gnd together?
[2023-06-30T14:16:30] Finn: Gnd needs to be connected or am i wrong @Mirono_escooters
[2023-06-30T14:26:12] AK: This is not proper
[2023-06-30T14:26:35] AK: Whatever, if you think that is proper, it's your right to do so üòÇüëç
[2023-06-30T14:30:45] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Eh I don't want 18 holes in my frame :)))
[2023-06-30T14:30:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: with no way to access and measure
[2023-06-30T14:30:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: or swap out
[2023-06-30T14:30:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: or fix
[2023-06-30T14:30:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: üíÄ
[2023-06-30T14:32:15] AK: Well that is a different propblem, you just cant access and measure
[2023-06-30T14:32:52] AK: What is done properly is, you print/mill a template from second grade material, and the kern and drill corresponding holes
[2023-06-30T14:33:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and every time you want to change your ESC to a different model
[2023-06-30T14:33:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: you have to drill new holes
[2023-06-30T14:33:38] AK: Whatever, let's just agree to disagree
[2023-06-30T14:33:39] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: into your scooter
[2023-06-30T14:33:44] AK: This is shizoid, no offense
[2023-06-30T14:33:46] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No that's not how it works
[2023-06-30T14:33:56] AK: That's like preparing your car for different engine swaps
[2023-06-30T14:34:03] AK: Its just retarded
[2023-06-30T14:34:04] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yes and?
[2023-06-30T14:34:32] Finn: One scooter one setup
[2023-06-30T14:34:38] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: you are literally selling your scooter, so why should I have to keep my ESC forever?
[2023-06-30T14:34:38] Finn: And when you modify smth buy new scooter
[2023-06-30T14:34:43] Mirono escooters: I support izuna on this
[2023-06-30T14:34:48] Mirono escooters: Makes more sense to adapt to existing holes
[2023-06-30T14:34:51] Mirono escooters: Then to drill new
[2023-06-30T14:35:07] Mirono escooters: Setups change
[2023-06-30T14:35:07] AK: I have no idea what you mean, ans as I said, I don't really care what way you do it
[2023-06-30T14:35:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Also got no time to discuss, I have to finish second MP2 till and arrive to meet
[2023-06-30T14:35:18] Finn: Yeah i was just joking
[2023-06-30T14:35:29] AK: In my opinion, you do it wrong, if you don't like my opinion, tough luck
[2023-06-30T14:35:47] AK: That's exactly how it works
[2023-06-30T14:36:36] AK: Same with retarded 30mm plastic spacers, that is just not something I would ever consider doing
[2023-06-30T14:36:47] AK: No matter how many kids do it
[2023-06-30T14:36:53] Finn: ü§°ü§°
[2023-06-30T14:39:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: That's exactly like saying, make cpu not swappable, make ram not swappable
[2023-06-30T14:39:21] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It's absolutely bullshit
[2023-06-30T14:39:34] AK: Lol what a strawman
[2023-06-30T14:39:40] AK: No, this is nothing like that
[2023-06-30T14:40:38] AK: Its like what I described, if you would never attach a car engine properly, because you might consider a different engine swap later
[2023-06-30T14:40:50] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: pee-pee poo-poo fight
[2023-06-30T14:41:45] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Versatility
[2023-06-30T14:42:06] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: When the controller has its own piece of aluminum that is screwed with three bolts to the frame
[2023-06-30T14:47:13] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-06-30T14:47:45] AK: I would never consider to220 for anything except for a test platform
[2023-06-30T14:47:59] AK: Everything else you need 4 screws to bolt to frame
[2023-06-30T14:48:04] AK: Whatever
[2023-06-30T14:48:14] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: bruh
[2023-06-30T14:49:16] S1m 0n: Ra-ta-ta-ta ta

[2023-06-30T14:49:36] puneDir: @aka13 do you know how to on off flipsky 75100?
[2023-06-30T14:49:42] puneDir: For my g30 project
[2023-06-30T14:49:52] puneDir: I want to make it look nice
[2023-06-30T14:50:01] puneDir: No not that
[2023-06-30T14:50:06] puneDir: I want something small
[2023-06-30T14:50:11] puneDir: Not like a loop key
[2023-06-30T14:50:19] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: BRRRRRRRSSSSUTUTUTUTUTUTUTUTUTUTUTU
[2023-06-30T14:51:26] AK: Yeah, turn off the main dcdc
[2023-06-30T14:51:43] AK: 3 minutes two resistors
[2023-06-30T14:55:28] AK: 5 sec

[2023-06-30T15:00:11] AK: Use switch/ignition to connect this leg to gnd, and it will turn off
[2023-06-30T15:03:40] rosheee: <voice_message>
[2023-06-30T15:06:25] puneDir: Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2023-06-30T15:15:47] rosheee: Ninebot g2 goes like dis
[2023-06-30T15:34:32] Mirono escooters: I'm guessing flipsky made it floating?
[2023-06-30T15:35:20] Finn: I mean if you pull it to ground isnt there a current flowing from ground to vcc
[2023-06-30T15:38:40] Finn: Im not an expert in IC technology
[2023-06-30T15:41:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: Enable pin is not a vcc
[2023-06-30T15:46:48] AK: Ye
[2023-06-30T15:47:28] AK: If you are pulling anywhere, you should always have a current limiting resistor, ye
[2023-06-30T16:05:03] Mirono escooters: Obviously
[2023-06-30T16:48:14] Thierry: So both gnd connected and possible to use 3.3v from another vesc?
[2023-06-30T16:59:40] AA: https://vesc-project.com/node/4201
[2023-06-30T18:19:19] Ion: When using the SpinY throttle with the ADC board, they recommend using the "normal" throttle (5v) Connection, not the vesc throttle connection. In this mode, is start point and end point calibration important? I could not get it to calibrate. But VESC tool has its own calibration?
[2023-06-30T18:42:09] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: what the hell üò≠
[2023-06-30T18:42:51] Ion: Do I do this when doing the vesc throttle setup? I could never get the motor to spin in calibration mode
[2023-06-30T18:43:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Meanwhile the wiring for script ü§Ø
[2023-06-30T18:43:27] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <photos/photo_8861@30-06-2023_18-43-27.jpg>
[2023-06-30T18:46:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Could be even cleaner if my 3.3v would be on the connector as well
[2023-06-30T18:46:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: even forgot to connect it now because I was in such a hurry to get to the train üòê
[2023-06-30T18:46:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But when connected works absolutely wonderful.
[2023-06-30T18:47:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Without it's a damn nightmare, I had to disable it in software üòÇ
[2023-06-30T18:47:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 3.3v
[2023-06-30T18:48:15] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Button thinks it's pressed on some occasions
[2023-06-30T18:48:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I took G30 apart to install second MP2 but wasn't able to make it in time, now took everything with me and install it later at a friend's house.
[2023-06-30T18:49:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: For me luckily not.
[2023-06-30T18:49:25] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But eh maybe it's very random
[2023-06-30T18:49:28] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: üòÇ
[2023-06-30T18:50:33] puneDir: Can we adjust amperes for different modes?
[2023-06-30T18:53:07] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes of course
[2023-06-30T18:53:11] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: There are 6 modes
[2023-06-30T18:53:16] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 3 normal 3 secret
[2023-06-30T18:53:53] puneDir: Can we delete secret modes
[2023-06-30T18:58:01] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes of course
[2023-06-30T19:16:59] puneDir: @kawaiinekololis do you think rear suspension is necessary for g30
[2023-06-30T19:22:39] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Hmm not sure yet
[2023-06-30T19:22:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I will tell when I actually try to drive like a maniac
[2023-06-30T19:29:52] AK: for midgets no
[2023-06-30T19:30:21] AK: If you are around 90kg+ scooter without suspension is just unpracticable
[2023-06-30T19:30:27] AK: If you plan to live 1+ years
[2023-06-30T19:31:58] puneDir: Im 85
[2023-06-30T19:32:07] puneDir: I guess i should consider getting one
[2023-06-30T19:32:18] AK: Well, you have to know for yourself
[2023-06-30T19:32:40] AK: If you drive on straight flat roads, maybe you don't need suspension
[2023-06-30T19:32:49] puneDir: I drive on bad roads
[2023-06-30T19:33:01] puneDir: Im thinking about the roads might caused my xiaomi to snap
[2023-06-30T19:33:18] AK: It certainly was not the wheelies with you being 85
[2023-06-30T19:35:04] puneDir: wheelies shouldnt be enough to snap a scooter in 2 weeks
[2023-06-30T19:35:44] puneDir: i did dual 2 weeks ago i guess
[2023-06-30T19:38:20] Pablo Fernandez: Wheelies are one of the worse things for scooter integrity. Too much pressure
[2023-06-30T19:38:49] puneDir: Yes Especially if you dont know how to do like me
[2023-06-30T19:38:55] Mirono escooters: Meh still
[2023-06-30T19:39:07] puneDir: I was pulling the scooter without pressing gas and pressing gas after that
[2023-06-30T19:39:21] Pablo Fernandez: I aint doing them
[2023-06-30T19:39:23] puneDir: So much stress on that small space
[2023-06-30T19:39:33] puneDir: Wheelies are for rentals üòÅ
[2023-06-30T19:39:36] Finn: Wheelies only end badüò≠
[2023-06-30T19:39:44] Finn: I agree
[2023-06-30T19:40:08] puneDir: Mines snapped after doing a wheelie
[2023-06-30T19:40:16] puneDir: Like 20 seconds after
[2023-06-30T19:56:33] Finn: Hope you learned
[2023-06-30T20:11:16] Finn: @Mirono_escooters

[2023-06-30T23:15:45] Finn: Da ship is ready to dock
[2023-06-30T23:31:57] Mirono escooters: O o
[2023-06-30T23:32:09] Mirono escooters: So overkill
[2023-07-01T00:14:11] Finn: I know
[2023-07-01T00:14:19] Finn: There isnt any good 4s 100A bms
[2023-07-01T00:17:00] Jan: Probably for drones
[2023-07-01T00:17:14] Jan: But maybe not
[2023-07-01T00:17:34] Finn: Drones have bms?
[2023-07-01T00:17:44] Finn: Thought the lipos just get discharged
[2023-07-01T00:17:54] Jan: Usually just externally
[2023-07-01T01:24:43] Oreo huzky: Racing drones don‚Äôt use bms they use normal lipo packs cells get balanced from charger
[2023-07-01T01:45:50] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: How tf
[2023-07-01T01:45:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Do I wire up can
[2023-07-01T01:59:59] Oreo huzky: Wasn‚Äôt it just can+ and can- ?
[2023-07-01T02:00:42] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Well... It's a little bit more complicated in my case.
[2023-07-01T02:00:46] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <photos/photo_8864@01-07-2023_02-00-46.jpg>
[2023-07-01T02:00:52] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I tried wiring up tx and rx first
[2023-07-01T02:00:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: didn't work
[2023-07-01T02:01:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: so maybe I have to wire up J1 3 + 2
[2023-07-01T02:01:11] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: also nope
[2023-07-01T02:01:55] Oreo huzky: Strange
[2023-07-01T02:02:07] Oreo huzky: Ah
[2023-07-01T02:02:31] Oreo huzky: You need to wire j1 4 and 1 too I would guess
[2023-07-01T02:04:14] Oreo huzky: Or am I wrong
[2023-07-01T02:20:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <video_file>

[2023-07-01T02:21:04] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @LizardDoggo
[2023-07-01T02:21:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: come watch me blow it up

[2023-07-01T02:31:14] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: when I'm done with the 20S6P battery 150A each, probably rear a little more and front less but we'll see. Phase 200A rear and 150A front. But for now ... 22S, 40A each üíÄ
[2023-07-01T02:31:30] rosheee: perfect :D

[2023-07-01T02:31:49] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 60h 22x3
[2023-07-01T02:32:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: ok now only plug in the hall for the front motor, switch phases so it spins not backwards (yeah I know it can be changed in software but I don't like that) and put everything back together...
[2023-07-01T02:32:38] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: it's getting late urgh
[2023-07-01T04:08:01] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Very different cable length
[2023-07-01T04:08:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but it's same motor
[2023-07-01T04:08:11] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: not sure why it differs that much
[2023-07-01T04:37:44] Finn: Uh could i safely use ebrake with 75100 alupcb and 20s
[2023-07-01T05:45:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_8867@01-07-2023_05-45-05.jpg>
[2023-07-01T10:15:43] Jan: Why you need bms internally?
[2023-07-01T10:19:27] Mirono escooters: Not
[2023-07-01T10:21:20] puneDir: 23 usd for dally bms Is it good price Or is there anything better for that price
[2023-07-01T10:22:04] puneDir: (20s)
[2023-07-01T10:28:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <photos/photo_8868@01-07-2023_10-28-55.jpg>
[2023-07-01T10:28:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Two MP2 installed and 22S üëÄ
[2023-07-01T10:53:24] Konstantin: I use like this, but love recup, and charge bat 83...83.3v.
[2023-07-01T10:53:49] Finn: I have 30A bat break
[2023-07-01T11:36:30] Uzzo Ô£ø: Jk Bms is better I think (full of nice feature like active balancing ecc), price is double tho
[2023-07-01T12:04:59] Mirono escooters: ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨
[2023-07-01T12:05:02] Mirono escooters: Anything above Daly xd
[2023-07-01T12:10:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: DALY is ok, but the best is getting a BMS with bluetooth like LLT BMS or JkBMS or anything else. It will help you a lot especially with Vesc.
[2023-07-01T13:11:36] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: diy
[2023-07-01T13:28:55] Jedich Nixan: Which Temp. Sensors can you recommend for my 2 800w Motors?
[2023-07-01T13:33:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: No, it‚Äôs for sale on AliExpress
[2023-07-01T13:34:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: Search it by picture
[2023-07-01T14:07:01] Konstantin: Burned shunt case fets buuuum xD 75200
[2023-07-01T14:09:10] Mirono escooters: Waa hoow
[2023-07-01T14:09:33] Mirono escooters: So much 75200 blow u p
[2023-07-01T14:13:24] puneDir: How
[2023-07-01T14:17:34] Konstantin: On 75200 often current offset jump... Mb this case it... Mb something else... 3*0.0005 ohms...it's peaks about 510amp... Need mb crafts 3 current sense sensor on each phase.. and probably it was clear waves forms... Want to test rebuild it to use phase shunt, it was able measuring each h and l on each phase. Like it work on 75300 original
[2023-07-01T14:18:06] Konstantin: <photos/photo_8870@01-07-2023_14-18-06.jpg>
[2023-07-01T14:21:27] Mirono escooters: OWO
[2023-07-01T14:21:29] Mirono escooters: Any fix?
[2023-07-01T14:22:01] Mirono escooters: @Oreohuzky
[2023-07-01T15:04:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not possible use shunt on phase over 75v
[2023-07-01T15:05:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: At least if you don‚Äôt use hall
[2023-07-01T15:30:23] Face de Pin Suc√©: You mean on flipsky?
[2023-07-01T15:32:46] Mirono escooters: How come
[2023-07-01T15:46:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: Normally not recommended for over 75v, also 3shul has shunt on the negative and not phases
[2023-07-01T15:48:18] Face de Pin Suc√©: Oh yes true I misread what you said
[2023-07-01T15:51:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: And if no phase shunt, then not current filter :(
[2023-07-01T15:51:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think nobody here work under 75v hahah, we are bad guy
[2023-07-01T15:52:14] Face de Pin Suc√©: why bad guy N
[2023-07-01T15:53:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not suce 120kmh on public road
[2023-07-01T15:53:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: 120 ?
[2023-07-01T16:12:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs the maximum for girls like me, recorded 132 with shit frame üòÇ
[2023-07-01T16:45:56] Luis Magalhaes: How much capacity you have there?

[2023-07-02T09:44:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Second video dead for some reason
[2023-07-02T12:49:42] Ion: You make/order own motors? Cool. What's different
[2023-07-02T12:52:16] Jedich Nixan: <photos/photo_8871@02-07-2023_12-52-16.jpg>
[2023-07-02T12:52:41] Jedich Nixan: 2nd Vid isnt playable
[2023-07-02T12:55:01] Jedich Nixan: handbrake, dvdfab, vlc, mpc or even vegaspro cant read the file
[2023-07-02T13:05:58] Mirono escooters: Kapot
[2023-07-02T13:06:01] Mirono escooters: What's handbrake
[2023-07-02T13:14:52] Ion: Software to convert between video formats (and do compression)
[2023-07-02T13:19:17] AK: gui for ffmpeg
[2023-07-02T21:11:38] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @jamessoderstrom
[2023-07-02T21:22:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Now using ADC (software-adc) but hardware adc supported as well with the script
[2023-07-02T22:25:21] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes
[2023-07-02T22:25:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It is also able to turn off ADC when turning off display like before, but now also when hardware adc is used.
[2023-07-02T22:26:00] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It's very nice.
[2023-07-02T22:26:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: The only feature I am missing now is start speed. VESC doesn't support minimum start speed ;/
[2023-07-02T22:26:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: The script is not public yet but I will release it as soon as I have finished testing it on reliability.
[2023-07-02T22:35:16] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_8872@02-07-2023_22-35-16.jpg>
[2023-07-02T22:35:18] Mirono escooters: Dayum
[2023-07-02T22:36:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes of course
[2023-07-02T22:37:25] Luis Magalhaes: Motorcycle?
[2023-07-02T22:46:47] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: eh I don't know u hold button and it stays on?
[2023-07-02T22:46:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: with my script?
[2023-07-02T22:47:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes CL1000 is amazing
[2023-07-02T22:47:21] Face de Pin Suc√©: Look at C700
[2023-07-02T22:47:45] Face de Pin Suc√©: <photos/photo_8873@02-07-2023_22-47-45.jpg>
[2023-07-02T22:48:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: You can see the power curve always more than 23KW
[2023-07-02T22:48:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: Only +11¬∞C üòÇ
[2023-07-02T22:48:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: 600A phase 300A battery
[2023-07-02T23:21:02] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: buying CL to use in less than 24S are not very efficient, because the power loose will be more than C version, CL are better to use between 24 to 32S
[2023-07-02T23:21:55] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: At same current, CL will heat more than C version
[2023-07-02T23:24:08] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: But all are very nice, that was me riding my sur-ron with C700 and Rage Mechanics R-spec motor IPM, the big battery warm-up to 100¬∞c üòÇ the QS8 was very very hot, but the controller and motor stay cold ‚ùÑ amazing, next step is going to 1000A
[2023-07-02T23:24:26] Finn: Surron battery is made of lipos?
[2023-07-02T23:24:36] Finn: Thought normal 21700
[2023-07-02T23:24:54] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-07-02T23:24:56] Mirono escooters: No lipo
[2023-07-02T23:24:59] Finn: Ooh okay
[2023-07-02T23:24:59] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: no it was 22S9P with 50G cells, not made for high power
[2023-07-02T23:25:04] Finn: Ah nice
[2023-07-02T23:25:11] Finn: 9p with 50güíÄ
[2023-07-02T23:25:37] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it is battery for capacity but used as performance, the consequency are heat and sag
[2023-07-02T23:25:45] Finn: 50s would be nice
[2023-07-02T23:25:53] Mirono escooters: ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨
[2023-07-02T23:25:56] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: <photos/photo_8874@02-07-2023_23-25-56.jpg>
[2023-07-02T23:26:03] Finn: But only 315A
[2023-07-02T23:26:11] Finn: Isnt that pretty low for a surron bike?
[2023-07-02T23:26:20] Mirono escooters: Only xd
[2023-07-02T23:26:25] Mirono escooters: Stock not powerful
[2023-07-02T23:26:39] Finn: I would also get one but too expensive with 5k‚Ç¨
[2023-07-02T23:26:52] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CtMKkYTPaZA/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
[2023-07-02T23:26:54] Finn: With selfmade 72V battery
[2023-07-02T23:27:40] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: you can see some view here, on the track where I overheat the battery https://www.instagram.com/reel/CttrqbstF50/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
[2023-07-02T23:27:49] Finn: Fuuuck i want oneüò≠
[2023-07-02T23:27:52] Mirono escooters: Thats why I went w bomber and saved money into batt
[2023-07-02T23:28:34] Finn: You got one?
[2023-07-02T23:28:42] Finn: Nicee
[2023-07-02T23:28:58] Mirono escooters: Yeah. But problably selling it
[2023-07-02T23:29:03] Finn: Ah
[2023-07-02T23:29:19] Finn: You need a license and insurrence?
[2023-07-02T23:29:39] Mirono escooters: Yeh
[2023-07-02T23:29:40] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yes, it's like a 50cc
[2023-07-02T23:29:44] Finn: Yeah
[2023-07-02T23:29:47] Finn: Same in germany
[2023-07-02T23:29:48] Mirono escooters: I'm moving onto boats and motorbikes
[2023-07-02T23:29:53] Finn: Hell yeah
[2023-07-02T23:29:55] Mirono escooters: I can't get a license for bomber
[2023-07-02T23:30:01] Finn: Electromotor boat
[2023-07-02T23:30:14] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: limited at 45 kmh in France, need driving licence dedicated or car driving licence to drive it
[2023-07-02T23:30:22] Finn: Yep same here
[2023-07-02T23:30:28] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but of course mine going to 120kmh so it's just illegal
[2023-07-02T23:30:31] Finn: Could get it. I have a driverslicense
[2023-07-02T23:30:35] Finn: Lmao
[2023-07-02T23:31:23] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: on the track, I was following the supermot 450cc 4 stokes
[2023-07-02T23:31:39] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: little less, but not that much
[2023-07-02T23:31:41] Finn: <photos/photo_8875@02-07-2023_23-31-41.jpg>
[2023-07-02T23:31:45] Finn: Light bee
[2023-07-02T23:31:51] Finn: The only thing rhat is legal in german
[2023-07-02T23:31:54] Mirono escooters: Yeah road legal version
[2023-07-02T23:31:57] Mirono escooters: Cost so much tho
[2023-07-02T23:32:03] Finn: Ye
[2023-07-02T23:32:05] Finn: 5k
[2023-07-02T23:32:13] Mirono escooters: Registration bs Even if i wanna legalise mine I can't ü§¢
[2023-07-02T23:32:20] Mirono escooters: Yeah no give me a motorbike for that
[2023-07-02T23:32:34] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yeah, but the electric are expansive guys... motorbike, Scooter, car, bike, patinette... unfortunately
[2023-07-02T23:32:42] Finn: Yep
[2023-07-02T23:33:06] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: I hope the price will reduce in the future, but not sure
[2023-07-02T23:33:13] Mirono escooters: Slowly
[2023-07-02T23:33:16] Mirono escooters: Still overpriced
[2023-07-02T23:33:41] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Yes, because the production cost are high and the quantity of production are small
[2023-07-02T23:33:58] Finn: How much is the stock battery
[2023-07-02T23:34:23] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: even at the same quantity of production than random v√©hicule, I'm sure it can be cheap as random v√©hicule because the motors, battery are still very expansive
[2023-07-02T23:34:34] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: of what?
[2023-07-02T23:34:48] Finn: How much ‚Ç¨ is the stock battery
[2023-07-02T23:34:57] Finn: I mean a 72V is arroung 800‚Ç¨
[2023-07-02T23:35:38] Mirono escooters: Very vague
[2023-07-02T23:35:42] Mirono escooters: U can build 20s1p 40‚Ç¨ lol
[2023-07-02T23:36:25] Finn: Haha
[2023-07-02T23:36:42] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: oem battery are 16SxP
[2023-07-02T23:37:08] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: so I don't know, but in second hand it can be sell for around 500~600‚Ç¨ the stock battery I think
[2023-07-02T23:37:33] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: for all the new battery, capacity or performance are between 1k and 2k+
[2023-07-02T23:37:54] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: on the shop, of course, public price
[2023-07-02T23:44:14] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it's expansive, but after you can enjoy the performance for long time just with electricity cost of recharge üòÅ no fuel
[2023-07-02T23:45:50] Mirono escooters: Tru, pennies in comparison
[2023-07-02T23:46:31] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: With the oil, piston, ring, fuel etc to change every 50h on a cross bike, it can be relatively compensated
[2023-07-02T23:47:27] Mirono escooters: I change my Esc every 50h :-p
[2023-07-02T23:53:39] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I wreck my scooters without driving them myself
[2023-07-02T23:54:03] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I think I drove my g30 almost less than other people üíÄ
[2023-07-02T23:56:57] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: you have problem bro üòú
[2023-07-02T23:57:19] Mirono escooters: Someone has to test mp2
[2023-07-02T23:58:27] Finn: What ak would say.
[2023-07-02T23:58:37] Finn: Little kids that doesnt know anythingüòÅ
[2023-07-02T23:59:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Me
[2023-07-03T00:00:04] Mirono escooters: Now it's you
[2023-07-03T00:00:09] Mirono escooters: Bike ain't moving
[2023-07-03T00:00:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: g30 moving sideways
[2023-07-03T00:00:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: it's so weird driving it while the front wheel is shifted 3cm to the side
[2023-07-03T00:00:53] Mirono escooters: Show
[2023-07-03T00:00:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: hope it won't just collapse
[2023-07-03T00:01:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: g30 group
[2023-07-03T00:01:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: can't really show from the outside
[2023-07-03T00:17:34] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: you can put an C350 on the G30 it can be fun
[2023-07-03T00:18:58] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-07-03T00:19:02] Mirono escooters: If you pay me one
[2023-07-03T00:19:36] Luis Magalhaes: no one knows lolol
[2023-07-03T00:19:59] Mirono escooters: Its only illegal if they know
[2023-07-03T00:21:02] Luis Magalhaes: @Foujiwara your surron have stock motor ?
[2023-07-03T00:48:42] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: no, stock motor can't get that power and torque, even if you pull lots of current in, he just heat a lot
[2023-07-03T00:49:12] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: it's R-spec motor from Rage Mechanics, will be available soon on the website Rage Mechanics
[2023-07-03T00:49:15] Luis Magalhaes: i was thinking that üòÇ nice
[2023-07-03T00:50:08] Luis Magalhaes: @Foujiwara and what range are you getting on that ?
[2023-07-03T00:50:55] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Range ? what do you mean ?
[2023-07-03T00:52:18] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: <photos/photo_8876@03-07-2023_00-52-18.jpg>
[2023-07-03T00:59:12] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: It's around 30kW peak motor, i will give you more information later if you are interested
[2023-07-03T01:24:06] Luis Magalhaes: from all the setup battery/power the range you can get riding normaly
[2023-07-03T01:24:53] Luis Magalhaes: just curious, thats a bike a really like but its all cash to speed lol
[2023-07-03T01:46:42] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Ahh, oh that i don't know, because i dont use my bike to riding normaly
[2023-07-03T01:47:41] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: i think, is you drive smooth, and less than 45 kmh, you can do 150 km with the 80V 45Ah i use
[2023-07-03T01:50:39] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: It's 3600Wh, with 2500Wh on like Nami you can do more than 100km
[2023-07-03T01:50:56] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: so i think 3600Wh on Surron you can do much more

[2023-07-03T09:47:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: I know this guy
[2023-07-03T09:47:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: Can work with 22x3 windings I think
[2023-07-03T09:48:04] Face de Pin Suc√©: But 126Kmh, not sure, maybe 115

[2023-07-03T09:51:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes but 125 need more than 70/75A controller, 55A no possible
[2023-07-03T09:57:23] Mirono escooters: How? Isn't nami limited by power?
[2023-07-03T11:45:47] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: but nami have field weakening
[2023-07-03T11:47:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: You can have anything but the current is the same, and no possible to beat air resistance
[2023-07-03T12:10:45] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: yes but the resistance of the air is probably not enough to limiting under 100 kmh with 9600W Nami can pull ~60A per controller, it's enough to go at 120 with the right position think
[2023-07-03T12:11:28] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: I will take care next time how much power I have when I cruise at 120kmh
[2023-07-03T12:32:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes but you need more watts to reach the speed
[2023-07-03T12:33:11] Mirono escooters: Keeping a speed is easy Reaching it oof
[2023-07-03T12:33:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: At least you aren‚Äôt 30kg, take off track and downhill , it‚Äôs he‚Äôd with 9600w
[2023-07-03T12:33:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: Exactly
[2023-07-03T12:33:35] puneDir: is 20s 80a discharge good?
[2023-07-03T12:33:52] puneDir: for ninebot gen1 motors üôä
[2023-07-03T12:34:03] puneDir: Man i really need good motor
[2023-07-03T12:34:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: It can‚Äôt support this current lol
[2023-07-03T12:34:22] puneDir: its giving ok performance at 15a
[2023-07-03T12:34:28] puneDir: 2x 15 is good
[2023-07-03T12:35:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: 40/45A enough to burn it
[2023-07-03T12:35:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Batt current
[2023-07-03T12:35:51] puneDir: 15 is ok
[2023-07-03T12:35:54] puneDir: im running dual
[2023-07-03T12:37:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Voltage doesn‚Äôt matter
[2023-07-03T12:37:52] puneDir: But it heats up more on 20s 15 to 10s 15
[2023-07-03T12:38:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: What controller?
[2023-07-03T12:38:11] Mirono escooters: Wa
[2023-07-03T12:38:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: The only reason because speed is higher, air resistance is more, and requires current is more
[2023-07-03T12:38:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: When the load is bigger controller push more continuos current
[2023-07-03T12:39:12] Mirono escooters: Peak u can ignore, continuous is dangerous
[2023-07-03T12:39:20] Mirono escooters: No way dual 36v u draw 15a each cont
[2023-07-03T12:39:53] puneDir: I was drawing 20a on 10s (single)
[2023-07-03T12:40:11] puneDir: and 15-15 on dual 20s and it was flying lol
[2023-07-03T12:40:27] Mirono escooters: Continuous?
[2023-07-03T12:40:36] Mirono escooters: 700w? At those low speeds? Na
[2023-07-03T12:40:47] puneDir: i setted 20 on xiao
[2023-07-03T12:40:53] puneDir: i dont remember much

[2023-07-03T12:41:32] puneDir: Yep
[2023-07-03T12:42:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: You can pulse inrush current 300A with Ninebot motor
[2023-07-03T12:43:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes at higher speed you‚Äôve more acceleration, that make sanse
[2023-07-03T12:45:01] puneDir: who?
[2023-07-03T12:45:10] puneDir: no i mean it was not slow at 15-15

[2023-07-03T23:12:59] Mirko Boni: Yes James, everyone was speechless..
[2023-07-03T23:23:21] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Looks nice
[2023-07-03T23:27:38] Mirko Boni: Hi @kawaiinekololis.. Thank you very much.. There's also a little bit of you in my scooter
[2023-07-03T23:31:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @jamessoderstrom just pushed the version that I am running of the ADC script on my g30 now to GitHub. https://github.com/m365fw/vesc_m365_dash/tree/6_05_adc g30_dash.lisp is tested and works well (software adc mode works, hardware adc should work but untested) m365_dash.lisp shares the same code but different protocol, but should work as well (untested tho).
[2023-07-03T23:32:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: And btw that also fixed my ebrake issue
[2023-07-03T23:32:47] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Seems set brake current relative causes these stutters, but when letting VESC handle brake it works.
[2023-07-03T23:40:13] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yup that would be neat to see it working.
[2023-07-03T23:50:10] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes but I think when getting a cable with multiple cores enough for dash, throttle, brake etc it should look clean as well. I might consider getting a spin-y2 throttle and going for hardware-adc as well.
[2023-07-04T00:04:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Connecting spiny to display might work but eh I can't tell. I think the best is wiring it directly to VESC.
[2023-07-04T00:05:25] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes probably using one way signal + variable ebrake
[2023-07-04T00:05:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: or smth
[2023-07-04T00:05:30] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: idk

[2023-07-04T00:08:05] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Just so...wow :D
[2023-07-04T00:08:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It's better to watch the road rather than looking at the dash...
[2023-07-04T00:09:11] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: yes
[2023-07-04T07:03:36] HTTP(s) Boost: How much H? And what is the Nami burn original dropout? Trying to figure out what can be the biggest hub installed there

[2023-07-04T07:06:25] AK: Should index better
[2023-07-04T07:07:01] AK: What was the issue with can-cmd?
[2023-07-04T07:09:44] puneDir: Cat6 maybe
[2023-07-04T07:13:52] puneDir: I have 2 questions 1- I have a g30 e 2 screen with newest BLE will it work with it? 2- I dont want another wires for brake and throttle Can i connect them to dashboard and use like that? Or its safe to connect them to Vesc's brake and gas cables
[2023-07-04T09:42:36] puneDir: anybody knows this?
[2023-07-04T09:49:36] Mirono escooters: Calm, we aren't all awake and or available

[2023-07-04T10:09:07] Jedich Nixan: do any of you guys have the 75100pro model? I wanted to swap the mosfets, but the original ones look like they have 5 pins. Is it necessary to swap these mosfets on the Pro model, maybe they are better and can handle more resistance and heat.
[2023-07-04T10:12:18] Mirono escooters: 5?
[2023-07-04T10:12:23] Mirono escooters: To220 Mos have 3
[2023-07-04T10:12:33] Mirono escooters: Gate source and drain
[2023-07-04T10:12:59] Mirono escooters: I wouldn't swap em, stock are pretty decent tbh
[2023-07-04T10:13:10] Mirono escooters: But you can if you have enough trust in your soldering skills
[2023-07-04T10:15:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I am unsure of what kind of mosfet it has
[2023-07-04T10:16:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Didnt see pics or rating why is pro better for you ü§î What more it offers, or just less crap box?

[2023-07-04T10:20:22] Mirono escooters: Time to upgrade
[2023-07-04T10:28:46] Jedich Nixan: That's what I was think. At the first view it seems to me they has 5 pins. Will take a look closer next time.
[2023-07-04T10:29:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Show pics what you saw
[2023-07-04T10:30:48] Jedich Nixan: Mines r too bad. too long since I last soldered. I got some few ppl whi can solder good enough.
[2023-07-04T10:32:40] Jedich Nixan: Unfortunately I didn't take any pictures because I was too busy with the engines. Maybe I can make some later.
[2023-07-04T10:34:48] Jedich Nixan: The only benefit I know is BT is included. Will see what Temp this Model will get when I pump some Amp thru it üòÅ
[2023-07-04T10:35:55] Jedich Nixan: But not on the normal 75100 model. It's recommended to change them.
[2023-07-04T10:36:03] Mirono escooters: Impossible
[2023-07-04T10:36:03] Mirono escooters: Well to220 is cheap af so

[2023-07-04T10:37:51] Jedich Nixan: Yes?
[2023-07-04T10:38:34] Jedich Nixan: How could I ask you about the Mosfets, if i don't have one?
[2023-07-04T10:39:24] Jedich Nixan: I know, that's what makes me think.
[2023-07-04T10:39:58] Jedich Nixan: to220 is the Type of Mosfet?
[2023-07-04T10:46:58] Jedich Nixan: So those types r cheap af and still pretty decent? I was told to change them, to get better Temps
[2023-07-04T10:54:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What you mean why?üòÅ anybody can ask such With any product Like 'what mosfets used in cl350 ?' Do i have one , no I dont have ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-07-04T10:55:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yes ,like in the single 75100

[2023-07-04T19:33:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: Energy waste , unsafe when you don‚Äôt use it, and deteriorating the buck converter keeping it always on

[2023-07-04T20:02:57] Martin Kaktits: Hello, braniacs. I require some insights and ideas - about someting as simple as turning off a vesc (flipsky 75100). As we know, the thing does not have an on/off button. I use a large antispark switch to cut main battery, but thats not comfortable every time - i would much rather use the key switch mechanism I already have on the scoot. Ofc the key switch not large enough to switch main batt power and normal relays too small too. I did experiment, however, using the key switch to switch a small relay which then would cut/ connect ADC1 signal cable, making the scooter functionally off... que my surprise when flipping the key switch off made motor accelerate full throttleüò¨ at least wheel was in air. Apparently: 0V = full throttle? Any other ideas of how and what i could cut/ do with a relay or two to turn it "off"/ on?

[2023-07-04T20:10:37] Mirono escooters: If ur sensor flies out too
[2023-07-04T20:10:41] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-07-04T20:12:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs why exactly you need on off button üòÇ
[2023-07-04T20:13:31] puneDir: I have a loop key but its on the back
[2023-07-04T20:13:41] puneDir: would software adc fix that
[2023-07-04T20:14:11] puneDir: Or hows going on on izunas script
[2023-07-04T20:14:57] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-07-04T20:15:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you throttle fail when it‚Äôs fully opened, then how can the controller detect your throttle is failed
[2023-07-04T20:18:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: You can put a button in ebrake pin
[2023-07-04T20:26:35] Martin Kaktits: oh, wait i could then relay cut ADC2 and have full brake on, which should prevent throttle from working and nake it even hrder to steal by forcing ebrake always üßê
[2023-07-04T20:28:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: You can just set max erpm to 1 by Bluetooth, if your goal is only stay safe by pushing throttleüòÇüòÇ
[2023-07-04T20:45:28] Jedich Nixan: That makes sense, didn't realize that if the Scooter is parked. So a On/Switch or Spark Switch would be good. Will see if I can do smth
[2023-07-04T21:23:07] Jonas: Cheers Guys, since police took my pro 2 I finally found motivation to build my completely own g30 max. So far so good built a 15s6p inside and will go on maybe 20s but not sure yet. My current problem is that no brake input is recognized same for throttle but firmware from November fixed it somehow. Brake still not working so I ordered one for Xiaomi and it's working.. anyways has somebody tried successful an AWD with 75100? I bought a motor which had no shipping cost (they forgot xd) which got a brake disk so is there a common way to get digital and analog brake with disk rear sided? I currently have mono....sshitm.. suspension but I would throw that bullshit away if I could get a nice and clean installed brake socket (rear, left sided, 10"). I am asking for AWD because I got the Xiaomi monorim motor which is really good but ofc only fits in the front and I would like to have ,2 digital and 2 analog brakes ofc. 1 analog should be enough I won't hunt the 100kmh+ like on my mi xD. also I was thinking about buying this charger. What's ur opinion? I think it's not too cheap has power and is adjustable https://a.aliexpress.com/_EuMJPAN are 2 Vescs to kill xD.
[2023-07-04T21:23:33] Mirono escooters: I have the excact same charger
[2023-07-04T21:23:47] Mirono escooters: Bang for buck. build quality is super, display is accurate tuned
[2023-07-04T21:24:02] Mirono escooters: 1 thing: The fan isn't ramping up It's or 0% speed Or 100% And it's pretty loud
[2023-07-04T21:24:29] Jonas: Ah doesn't matter
[2023-07-04T21:24:35] Jonas: Celler
[2023-07-04T21:25:02] Mirono escooters: Perfect then
[2023-07-04T21:25:27] Jonas: Ty
[2023-07-04T21:36:29] Jonas: Also what would you recommend to place battery and ESC?I had best temps with an water-cooling block and fans from 3d printer running at 36v also tried GPU fans but they are just noisy as fk but the did their job. Since I am not out for reaching stupid amounts of speed I guess mks75100 won't get too hot (right)? 15s 48v 500w motor
[2023-07-04T21:41:44] Mirono escooters: Just bolt to frame
[2023-07-04T21:41:48] Mirono escooters: With a thermal pad
[2023-07-04T21:42:01] Mirono escooters: Yes alu pcb 75100 perfect
[2023-07-04T21:43:46] Ion: With VESC, you can put "digital brake" which is electronic or regenerative braking on a separate throttle or use a combined throttle like SpinY For analog brake (do you mean mechanical? because analog is also a term form electric brake) you can use whatever fits and control it separately.
[2023-07-04T21:44:20] Ion: What country are you in that police took the scooter üò≥
[2023-07-04T21:44:40] Jonas: Gernany
[2023-07-04T21:44:47] Jonas: They just drove over ne
[2023-07-04T21:44:52] Jonas: Me
[2023-07-04T21:45:16] Jonas: Scooter gone
[2023-07-04T21:45:19] Jonas: All gone
[2023-07-04T21:45:39] Jonas: And I drove 10 because of frozen street
[2023-07-04T21:46:14] Jonas: Willl have my process soon.....
[2023-07-04T21:46:46] Jonas: So if u see those fakers:run
[2023-07-04T21:47:49] Jonas: I can still ping the bms in police station
[2023-07-04T21:48:34] Jonas: Hat happens if 10s is suddenly only 1s?
[2023-07-04T21:49:40] Jonas: Jk would never do that ofc üåöüåö
[2023-07-04T21:49:40] Mirono escooters: Kaput?
[2023-07-04T21:49:46] Mirono escooters: Just disable BMS? No proof
[2023-07-04T21:50:02] Jonas: They crashed me with 50kmh
[2023-07-04T21:50:11] Jonas: I didn't even notice
[2023-07-04T21:50:49] Jonas: Just saw scooter extendo battery was like 30m away
[2023-07-04T21:52:04] Jonas: Then they fked my face with 6 ppl vs me being unconscious
[2023-07-04T21:52:20] Jonas: Now I am the guy who is anti police
[2023-07-04T21:52:22] Mirono escooters: Oof
[2023-07-04T21:52:24] Mirono escooters: Police dicks
[2023-07-04T21:52:28] Jonas: Man so much money
[2023-07-04T21:52:30] Mirono escooters: Welcome to the group
[2023-07-04T21:52:55] Jonas: Just short intro
[2023-07-04T21:53:16] Jonas: Zuna (think u know him) thought me basically all
[2023-07-04T21:55:00] Jonas: <photos/photo_8889@04-07-2023_21-55-00.jpg>
[2023-07-04T21:55:45] Jonas: Right now I at the point putting battery inside g30
[2023-07-04T21:56:05] Jonas: But I can't come to conclusion
[2023-07-04T21:56:14] Jonas: Which position would make most sence
[2023-07-04T21:56:39] Jonas: Since motor is rear but dispay not üåö
[2023-07-04T22:12:21] AK: Totally happened bro
[2023-07-04T22:12:30] AK: Just like watercooling on a 75100
[2023-07-05T14:27:21] Awyba: do you have to setup a bluetooth module or can you just start using it? because when i try to connect via vesc tool app it disconnects me after a few seconds
[2023-07-05T14:39:50] Awyba: yes i already noticed that one pin is not correct
[2023-07-05T15:14:10] Awyba: So i have following problem now i disconnected the battery and now when i reconnect it the controller turns on for like 1 second and then just turns off and then i have to wait like a minute then the same thing happens again when connecting the battery
[2023-07-05T15:24:11] Mirono escooters: Seems like BMS cuts out?
[2023-07-05T15:24:12] Mirono escooters: Short circuit? Too low protection value?
[2023-07-05T15:31:59] Awyba: idk cant acess the bms but when i leave it plugged in it also turns on after like a minute and then instantly turns off again
[2023-07-05T15:42:27] Awyba: tested it with notebook power supply and with that it stays on
[2023-07-05T15:43:12] Mirono escooters: Sounds like ur battery is wrongly configured
[2023-07-05T15:43:15] Mirono escooters: Is it Bluetooth
[2023-07-05T15:48:53] Awyba: happy bms from denis because i had xiaomi contoller before
[2023-07-05T15:49:15] Mirono escooters: Oof
[2023-07-05T15:49:17] Mirono escooters: I suspect it triggers overcurrent, big caps
[2023-07-05T15:50:46] Awyba: what can i do now i have no idea
[2023-07-05T15:51:21] Mirono escooters: New bms
[2023-07-05T15:52:36] Awyba: the weird thing is it worked the first time but now it doesnt anymore
[2023-07-05T20:05:37] Awyba: Fixed it i had to plug in the charger and then the bms turns back on
[2023-07-05T22:15:42] rosheee: <video_file>

[2023-07-05T23:07:02] Mirono escooters: Wich performance improvements do we expect
[2023-07-05T23:40:34] Ion: Going for even more speed xD? o
[2023-07-05T23:55:23] Jan: Feels about the same for me up to 100kph, but after... Need more testing
[2023-07-05T23:55:26] Jan: Yes
[2023-07-05T23:55:36] Jan: Lets see what they got

[2023-07-06T00:37:58] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: I mean, it have spring in this circle?
[2023-07-06T00:38:37] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Or you just rolling it when you want brake at 130kph?üòÅ
[2023-07-06T00:48:09] Ion: Yes, it's self centering with a spring. Movement is only a few cm
[2023-07-06T00:48:36] puneDir: i didnt liked the idea
[2023-07-06T00:48:45] puneDir: you need to get used to it
[2023-07-06T00:49:21] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: hmmmm
[2023-07-06T00:50:14] Ion: Thats true. But once you get used to it, it's great. I also let friends try that never drove a scooter and they figured it out :)
[2023-07-06T01:00:31] Pablo Fernandez: like motorcycles but with thumb
[2023-07-06T02:29:42] Jonas: Is the brake system custom made or could I buy them. Looks sick!

[2023-07-07T11:04:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: Wtf
[2023-07-07T11:05:04] Mirono escooters: : )
[2023-07-07T11:05:08] Jan: MP2, C350, Spintend 12fet are in the race
[2023-07-07T11:05:23] Mirono escooters: I'm voting for mp2. I'm patriotic

[2023-07-07T11:05:44] puneDir: Anyone installed 75100 to g30 motherboard box and dipped in resin?
[2023-07-07T11:05:53] Mirono escooters: Why
[2023-07-07T11:06:06] Mirono escooters: Sell original Esc, worth 60-80‚Ç¨
[2023-07-07T11:06:10] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-07-07T11:06:38] puneDir: Already did But we have infinity g30 motherboard casing
[2023-07-07T11:06:59] Mirono escooters: Ah
[2023-07-07T11:07:09] Mirono escooters: I don't know why u wanna use the cheap alu housing
[2023-07-07T11:07:15] puneDir: And dipping in resin seems to be a nice idea because of water resistance And easy mount in g30
[2023-07-07T11:07:34] Mirono escooters: Rip repairability
[2023-07-07T11:07:49] Mirono escooters: Why not ( and this sooo abstract idea) Seal your scooter well?
[2023-07-07T11:07:50] Mirono escooters: : D
[2023-07-07T11:09:32] puneDir: Will do too
[2023-07-07T11:10:09] puneDir: But it would be easily mounted in g30 like that
[2023-07-07T11:15:24] sombre_enfant: G30 is nearly waterproof i once ride in heavy rain + inondation and there was almost no water inside just a few drop of water
[2023-07-07T11:15:59] Mirono escooters: Use silicon ezpz
[2023-07-07T11:16:03] puneDir: ye
[2023-07-07T11:16:08] Mirono escooters: Never water damage I
[2023-07-07T11:17:27] sombre_enfant: Sillicone the hole for Dashboard and brake line and u good
[2023-07-07T11:25:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: Mp2 need diy
[2023-07-07T11:25:14] Mirono escooters: So?
[2023-07-07T11:25:21] Mirono escooters: It's not like this group is afraid of it
[2023-07-07T11:27:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not everyone has time to do it, that‚Äôs the problem
[2023-07-07T11:27:37] Mirono escooters: Still I don't understand
[2023-07-07T11:27:45] Mirono escooters: Why does it matter diy or not
[2023-07-07T11:27:55] Mirono escooters: Pay someone to make, or
[2023-07-07T11:28:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: I mean you can‚Äôt buy it already done
[2023-07-07T11:28:48] sombre_enfant: Still havent started yet i have to do 4...
[2023-07-07T11:29:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: And it isn‚Äôt still reliable, less than 10 people I think done it , and no tested enough
[2023-07-07T11:29:21] Mirono escooters: If someone need I gladly make for them for cost of material
[2023-07-07T11:29:23] Mirono escooters: I did izunas too
[2023-07-07T11:29:36] Mirono escooters: It's realiable af xD
[2023-07-07T11:29:42] Mirono escooters: And opensource, constantly improving
[2023-07-07T11:30:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: You can‚Äôt say that just by using it some month
[2023-07-07T11:30:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: Spintend exist since many years like 3shul
[2023-07-07T11:30:37] Mirono escooters: Ok opinions differ
[2023-07-07T11:30:41] sombre_enfant: I will need you to help me make it works
[2023-07-07T11:30:46] Mirono escooters: Sure
[2023-07-07T11:31:39] Mirono escooters: We Rlly need a new group buy xD I want more
[2023-07-07T11:31:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: Don‚Äôt wanna say mp2 isn‚Äôt good
[2023-07-07T11:31:57] Mirono escooters: Mp2 + alupcb would be the shit
[2023-07-07T11:32:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: But if someone want something very reliable ‚Ä¶
[2023-07-07T11:33:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: To220 is even reliable , very good performance
[2023-07-07T11:33:51] Mirono escooters: I know
[2023-07-07T11:34:02] Mirono escooters: But from cooling perspective and power
[2023-07-07T11:34:06] Mirono escooters: And assembly..
[2023-07-07T11:34:31] Mirono escooters: Luckily tronic never blow up : D
[2023-07-07T11:34:40] Mirono escooters: But yes for price to220 is so perfect
[2023-07-07T11:35:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, I‚Äôm the fact it isn‚Äôt reliable, who buy it is only because of rion performance ‚Äúreputation‚Äù
[2023-07-07T11:35:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: They think it has same performance as rion re90 performance
[2023-07-07T11:35:58] Mirono escooters: Poor roschee and jan
[2023-07-07T11:36:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: But nobody know re90 is based on BAC4000 , with 4 fet
[2023-07-07T11:36:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: For the space they have it was the most powerful
[2023-07-07T11:36:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: They don‚Äôt have choices:/
[2023-07-07T11:36:52] Mirono escooters: I know
[2023-07-07T11:37:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: Like me using flipsky ‚Ä¶.
[2023-07-07T11:37:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: But it is the smaller 100A vesc that exist üòÇ
[2023-07-07T11:38:11] Mirono escooters: Offers u make w G30 and big batt
[2023-07-07T11:39:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: I still no did nothing , I sold my main scooter , and need first finish wolf then g30
[2023-07-07T11:39:49] Mirono escooters: :(
[2023-07-07T11:39:58] Mirono escooters: I'm more into motorbikes now
[2023-07-07T11:40:01] Mirono escooters: Finish G30 someday
[2023-07-07T12:00:14] Jan: I actually dont use the rion, i use the little focer 3.1 because of its tiny size
[2023-07-07T12:00:41] Jan: But reliability is not really the best and sometimes they randomly fail
[2023-07-07T12:01:32] Jan: 100x120x25mm is about the max space
[2023-07-07T12:02:03] Face de Pin Suc√©: That's why I gave up with those focers/tronic
[2023-07-07T12:02:08] Jan: Not burnt, nothing, just doesnt boot anymore
[2023-07-07T12:02:21] Face de Pin Suc√©: was about to import 100pcs at a time, then killed too many of these x)
[2023-07-07T12:02:33] Jan: ^^
[2023-07-07T12:02:58] Jan: But 12fet small alu esc for that volume is hard to find
[2023-07-07T12:03:19] Jan: 25mm is critical max height
[2023-07-07T12:03:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: Same board
[2023-07-07T12:03:33] Mirono escooters: They Rlly tried to make mp2 smol
[2023-07-07T12:03:42] Jan: Yeah more or less it is
[2023-07-07T12:03:43] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Spintend 12fet without alubox maybe
[2023-07-07T12:03:45] Mirono escooters: What you do with em
[2023-07-07T12:04:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Available?
[2023-07-07T12:04:06] Jan: Warranty return
[2023-07-07T12:04:21] Mirono escooters: A
[2023-07-07T12:04:26] Mirono escooters: And they keep giving warranty?
[2023-07-07T12:04:42] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Looks like very soon
[2023-07-07T12:04:46] Jan: They stopped responding
[2023-07-07T12:05:29] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: .
[2023-07-07T12:07:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: Maybe new C350 with caps flat instead of standing and without case, can be I think
[2023-07-07T12:08:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: I should receive in 30 days the latest revisions, so will keep you updated with it
[2023-07-07T13:45:29] Awyba: What can i do to improve Bluetooth Connection because its very instable and laggy
[2023-07-07T13:58:20] Jan: @SibClimb shul esc is in 100x120x25mm?
[2023-07-07T13:58:36] Jan: Spintend 12fet too big
[2023-07-07T14:01:49] Jan: @kawaiinekololis you got MP2 dimensions?
[2023-07-07T14:06:00] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: One sec, I can measure them
[2023-07-07T14:11:49] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: MP2 dimensions on my G30 118mm long 100mm width 23mm height (on phase cables), otherwise on pill (second highest point), it's only 20mm
[2023-07-07T14:12:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: So uhm yeah MP2 very flat
[2023-07-07T14:12:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: phase cables could be improved by angling them further, pill can be lowered by not using sockets but directly solder it and third highest point caps can be smaller (currently using 100v 1000uF nichicon).

[2023-07-08T01:25:06] SKT T1 Rakion: Yeah I know how to solder and I have a little bit more than basic knowledge of electronics, and I have a lot of electronics tools (JST, XT 60, XT 90, wires, GX 16 connector, multimeter, etc..). But I have to understand what a Vesc is, how does it work and how to encode it..

[2023-07-08T17:19:10] AK: You could, but you should not, since you can not guarantee even potential and load
[2023-07-08T18:39:20] Santiago: How did you screw the hose to the left side of the caliper??
[2023-07-08T23:30:14] Ion: There is an adapter kit. Basically it's using another banjo screw for the brake line. This is done to get the hose on the outside for more clearance
[2023-07-08T23:31:06] Santiago: That's why I'm asking it's annoying in the other side xD
[2023-07-08T23:31:48] Santiago: But the screw is different BC the threaded hole is wider
[2023-07-08T23:31:56] Santiago: May you share the link??
[2023-07-08T23:32:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: Take a look at Elvedes Hydro part 5 ;)

[2023-07-10T14:12:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: Has included ble and better quality
[2023-07-10T14:12:52] Sobotek: Flipsky alu?

[2023-07-10T17:57:02] Thierry: Also wires are awg10 instead of 12 and something with temperature detection but not sure that it is a major improvement.

[2023-07-11T15:38:56] Krysteek: I have set 60a. And only above 20 km / h the power from 800-900 watts gives 3000 watts

[2023-07-12T02:08:40] JPPL: Were you hard testing or just burned somehow
[2023-07-12T02:13:00] Face de Pin Suc√©: We had one burnt on air with only field weakening
[2023-07-12T02:13:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: And one burnt on Surron, with like 400A phase
[2023-07-12T02:13:37] Face de Pin Suc√©: but when I say burnt, I mean took fire, for real
[2023-07-12T02:41:13] JPPL: Fuck
[2023-07-12T02:41:50] JPPL: They went till 65¬∞ but ambience temp is 30¬∞

[2023-07-12T02:55:13] Pablo Fernandez: Lucky here we get 50¬∞ ambience
[2023-07-12T03:00:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: it wasn't because of heating
[2023-07-12T03:03:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: We don't know, and I don't want to loose more money

[2023-07-12T03:12:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: We had 4 that took fire
[2023-07-12T03:13:04] Face de Pin Suc√©: And one more that is only dead
[2023-07-12T03:13:34] JPPL: The burn occur on air and first tests?
[2023-07-12T03:13:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: Oh, another point, if you remove UART from app, even if you have permanent uart enabled, you won't have BLE working anymore until you add again "ADC and Uart" for example x)
[2023-07-12T03:14:16] Face de Pin Suc√©: No, one were used like 1-2 months

[2023-07-12T03:15:28] Face de Pin Suc√©: We were lucky, everytime on a motorcycle, not inside a scooter
[2023-07-12T03:15:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: Or scooter would be burnt/damaged
[2023-07-12T03:21:47] Face de Pin Suc√©: We haven't been able to find out what cause this
[2023-07-12T03:24:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: No because it's not a big enough short

[2023-07-13T18:09:10] JPPL: If 20a BMS I think you can push a little more, but keep it at 20/25a max
[2023-07-13T18:10:11] Qhis: Ok, thanksüëç
[2023-07-13T18:11:05] Jan: 20a BMS perfect for a front light
[2023-07-13T18:12:28] Mirono escooters: The worst is the cells in scootermode batt is 35e? Or idk, anyway they handle more amps
[2023-07-13T18:12:40] Mirono escooters: But he puts in lower a BMS to save ‚Ç¨, have to pay more for higher A üò≠

[2023-07-13T18:32:52] Qhis: I didn't know that back thenüòè
[2023-07-13T18:34:04] Mirono escooters: Well, it makes sense if your Xiaomi max 20a But come on, that's so sad for future upgrade, 10‚Ç¨ BMS upgrade
[2023-07-13T18:43:42] Qhis: <photos/photo_8944@13-07-2023_18-43-42.jpg>
[2023-07-13T18:46:58] Qhis: Big thanks for everyone, i will try üëç
[2023-07-13T18:48:22] Qhis: Is the gear ratio wrong and what's a good number?
[2023-07-13T18:49:59] JPPL: 1 yes
[2023-07-13T18:50:34] Qhis: üôè
[2023-07-13T19:06:24] Qhis: Now it works niceüëå
[2023-07-13T19:11:15] Qhis: I have a 3 cable light switch for lights. Does someone have a photo how to put the 3 wires on adc adapter? Everything else i have finished.
[2023-07-13T19:17:45] JPPL: Show your switcher
[2023-07-13T19:21:36] Qhis: <photos/photo_8945@13-07-2023_19-21-36.jpg>
[2023-07-13T19:40:48] JPPL: On the side of ADC adapter, after throttle, you have 3speed then headlight and horn for example
[2023-07-13T19:41:07] JPPL: Both Switcher positivo goes for example to headlight
[2023-07-13T19:41:13] JPPL: Or both to horn
[2023-07-13T19:41:57] Qhis: Ok. What i do with the negative wire?
[2023-07-13T19:42:02] JPPL: Then negative goes wherever you want that have gnd
[2023-07-13T19:42:12] Qhis: Big thanksüëå
[2023-07-13T19:42:52] JPPL: Don't forget for ADC adapter works with this switcher and lights etc need 12v supply
[2023-07-13T19:44:26] JPPL: Btw guys, any way to turn off blinkers beep beep from ADC adapter? Little annoying
[2023-07-13T21:13:21] Qhis: What's there wrong? I got light to the light switch and I shared light switch gnd with rear light gnd. But no front light or rear light when you push the light switch..
[2023-07-13T21:21:26] Gordan Gizdic: Does anyone know the battery config of the vestt 11 super 72 batt pack? I know its 20s, but how many P and which cells. Also, how much current can it provide?
[2023-07-13T21:28:56] Gordan Gizdic: So 100A from pack?
[2023-07-13T21:29:04] Gordan Gizdic: Not enough. üòÇ
[2023-07-13T23:27:47] JPPL: 12v supply missing
[2023-07-14T00:09:12] Qhis: I tried that and it didn't help. The light switch light glows but nothing else..No lights.
[2023-07-14T00:09:48] Qhis: Is there matter if it's momentary or latching button?
[2023-07-14T00:33:03] Qhis: Now the front light works. Has anyone used g30 original rear light (2 cable/red&black) with adc v2 adapter?
[2023-07-14T07:46:16] AK: It is 5v, you have to supply it with 5, or change the current resistor in the light
[2023-07-14T08:42:26] rosheee: ah then put on 5v üòÜnot 12 sorry
[2023-07-14T10:27:02] Qhis: Thank you, i'll try thatüôèüôÇ
[2023-07-14T10:27:20] AK: It has a built in current regulator
[2023-07-14T10:27:34] AK: I'll try and find the schematic, I have it somewhere
[2023-07-14T10:27:48] AK: But tbh it's easier to just connect it to 5 and not fuck around
[2023-07-14T10:29:18] Qhis: üëç
[2023-07-14T10:29:44] Qhis: I'll try this firstüëç
[2023-07-14T10:53:09] Qhis: Can i use 5v from throttle or ADC for rear light?
[2023-07-14T12:10:11] JPPL: I don't recommend
[2023-07-14T12:11:26] JPPL: I really think it need 12v supply minimum to work lights etc, maybe I'm wrong
[2023-07-14T12:16:46] Qhis: Oküëç
[2023-07-14T12:55:58] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, lights are working from external 12v
[2023-07-14T16:41:28] ZHEV: Hello friend !! Does anyone have this controller? I have trouble updating, and I can't synchronize with the new wireless remote

[2023-07-14T16:42:26] ZHEV: I don't understand that error
[2023-07-14T16:57:00] asyan4ik: Bluetooth integrated in controller ?
[2023-07-14T16:57:13] ZHEV: Yes

[2023-07-14T16:57:36] asyan4ik: Connect from pc
[2023-07-14T16:58:01] ZHEV: If that I am doing, but it tells me an invalid version
[2023-07-14T16:59:37] asyan4ik: First you need to connect from a computer and flash the controller
[2023-07-14T17:03:52] ZHEV: That's what I do, but it seems that I don't put the exact firmware or the correct version
[2023-07-14T17:03:59] ZHEV: And the fault keeps coming out
[2023-07-14T17:18:20] gil guy: 5p with samsung 35E , you can drain 50~60A from your battery . just disconnect bms on discharge.
[2023-07-14T17:18:32] Mirono escooters: ü•≤
[2023-07-14T18:47:26] JPPL: Is one good option, I personally use direct discharge on my 400a discharge battery, that BMS is really protecting your battery, if 20a is not enough for your setup you still have room to double your power, all depends on your project and demand
[2023-07-14T18:56:22] Qhis: Thanks for all the adviceüëå
[2023-07-14T22:12:01] Shoaib: Why is this noice like its loosing torque on full throttle
[2023-07-14T22:12:13] Shoaib: After updating to 6.2

[2023-07-15T19:26:43] Happy Giraffe: Someone said about Mxlemming heating motor more than Ortega. Im trying to test a bit but its complicatef as some saturation compensation is needed for the geared motorüòÇ
[2023-07-15T19:26:57] Happy Giraffe: So far ortega works with lambda compensation
[2023-07-15T19:27:36] Happy Giraffe: If anyone digged deeper in these settings feel free to give me a headstartüòÅ
[2023-07-15T19:40:57] Mirono escooters: Lambda Is maker?
[2023-07-15T19:44:17] JPPL: I never changed those settings and everything works fine
[2023-07-15T19:47:19] Happy Giraffe: I think I have a 20/30mm magnet haha changes how motor behaves
[2023-07-15T19:48:10] Happy Giraffe: Is there 6.3 now btw?
[2023-07-15T19:49:49] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 6.05 is beta right know

[2023-07-15T19:51:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Didnt use it yet. @kawaiinekololis did
[2023-07-15T19:52:53] JPPL: 6.02
[2023-07-15T19:55:06] JPPL: 5.03 have Fieldweaking already right?
[2023-07-15T19:55:33] Happy Giraffe: Yes I remember so
[2023-07-15T19:56:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, thats right
[2023-07-15T19:57:52] JPPL: Yeah, because g300 comes with 5.3 and they advice to use it, so maybe I will start making my tests on 5.03, until now 6.02 went fine overall
[2023-07-15T19:58:21] JPPL: I was in doubt if 5.03 have fW and yes it's confirmed
[2023-07-15T19:58:41] JPPL: I just need to check recent logs to see if any improvement on that sector

[2023-07-15T21:20:35] Happy Giraffe: Just to see how slightly changing autodetect settings does
[2023-07-15T21:21:03] Mirono escooters: O no
[2023-07-15T22:52:54] Yosi Moreno: Just wandering... What is the difference between flipsky and maker bace ?
[2023-07-15T22:53:12] Mirono escooters: Almost nothing
[2023-07-15T22:53:19] Mirono escooters: Makerbase copies flipsky
[2023-07-15T22:54:37] Yosi Moreno: It looks the same.. how come? Is it like a different company that just copied flipsky ?
[2023-07-15T22:54:42] Mirono escooters: Ya
[2023-07-15T22:55:32] Yosi Moreno: Lol wich one is better?

[2023-07-15T22:55:53] Mirono escooters: Flipsky, by a tad
[2023-07-15T22:55:56] Mirono escooters: Both

[2023-07-15T23:01:42] Cass: MK also
[2023-07-15T23:02:42] Mirono escooters: Such bs
[2023-07-15T23:02:45] Mirono escooters: Any reasoning?

[2023-07-16T18:35:30] Mirono escooters: How
[2023-07-16T18:48:42] Happy Giraffe: I have no idea, also sometimes it said something is above harware value. Like 32->35A batt currentüòÇ
[2023-07-16T18:49:00] Happy Giraffe: Some bug in firmware, had to restart vesc once in a while

[2023-07-16T22:27:16] Finn: Yes
[2023-07-16T22:28:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes the question is if the BMS cut-out when the ESC died or if the BMS was the reason it died.
[2023-07-16T22:28:38] Mirono escooters: Yes bms cutoff= dead mos on flipsky
[2023-07-16T22:28:41] Mirono escooters: It's just design fail

[2023-07-16T22:30:33] Mirono escooters: I can't, but yes I agree
[2023-07-16T22:30:40] Finn: Smaller
[2023-07-16T22:30:42] Mirono escooters: But I like the idea of a alupcb mp2
[2023-07-16T22:30:45] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: no we need TOLL alu pcb
[2023-07-16T22:30:49] Mirono escooters: Cable management needed
[2023-07-16T22:30:57] Finn: Yes
[2023-07-16T22:30:57] Finn: Alu
[2023-07-16T22:31:00] Finn: Better then mounting mosfets on bottom platr
[2023-07-16T22:31:04] Finn: Naah its fineüòÅ
[2023-07-16T22:31:14] AK: Any esc will die if you have regen on and bms cuts, quickly and violently
[2023-07-16T22:31:20] Mirono escooters: Well, too much cables and little space
[2023-07-16T22:31:25] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes but it dies even without regen.
[2023-07-16T22:31:49] AK: That I don't have an opinion on :D
[2023-07-16T22:32:28] Mirono escooters: It's because they lack gate pulldown resistors or something
[2023-07-16T22:40:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: i mean why should it not fit
[2023-07-16T22:40:14] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: the heatsink we put into @andym365 scooter and he has 16s as well
[2023-07-16T22:40:16] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: is the same size
[2023-07-16T22:40:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: like a mp2
[2023-07-16T22:40:25] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: mp2 is only 100x75
[2023-07-16T22:40:45] Finn: Hm
[2023-07-16T22:40:48] Finn: On bottom plate
[2023-07-16T22:41:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: bottom plate hmm don't know
[2023-07-16T22:41:45] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: the issue is the rounding of the frame
[2023-07-16T22:41:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: otherweise ezpz

[2023-07-17T08:49:25] AK: Switched observers on the way to work today
[2023-07-17T08:49:31] AK: <photos/photo_8954@17-07-2023_08-49-31.jpg>
[2023-07-17T08:50:38] Unknown: Asi is not a vesc you are in a vesc group
[2023-07-17T09:03:58] AK: I think a phase on the rear motor is dead
[2023-07-17T09:15:51] Jan: Gonna copy this from the vsett 10+ board: "Are you absolutely sure its not the controller? Because this looks exactly the same and its 99% more likely to happen than a motor. The motor is barely impossible to blow on a stock use."
[2023-07-17T09:16:10] AK: Phase as in phase on the controller obv
[2023-07-17T09:16:25] AK: The motor is running too cool to cause any issues
[2023-07-17T09:18:49] Finn: That handlebar is huge
[2023-07-17T09:19:25] AK: For big boys
[2023-07-17T10:07:02] puneDir: i love small handlebars
[2023-07-17T10:07:22] puneDir: its better for small places (like doors and gates)
[2023-07-17T10:09:47] Pablo Fernandez: I run 720mm, bit annoying in elevators
[2023-07-17T10:58:34] Mihail: Yes. I was even thinking of putting xiaomi handlebars on my Vsett 10+ but the steering geometry is really bad.
[2023-07-17T11:06:57] Mirono escooters: No precise control tho
[2023-07-17T11:16:43] Finn: And easy wobble
[2023-07-17T14:35:45] Simone: any experience in vesc i2c display ?
[2023-07-17T15:36:13] Gordan Gizdic: Anyone online thats good with bmses?
[2023-07-17T15:36:27] Mirono escooters: Demends wich
[2023-07-17T15:36:36] Gordan Gizdic: Got a separate port bms but i got a simple question.
[2023-07-17T15:38:05] Gordan Gizdic: <video_file>
[2023-07-17T15:56:04] Gordan Gizdic: Found the answer. Nope, can do it but loosing protection and this is going to a friend of mine so ill just do it the proper way.
[2023-07-17T15:57:24] Mirono escooters: Pls type it. My wifi isn't handlkng it
[2023-07-17T15:57:26] Mirono escooters: Vacation
[2023-07-17T15:57:34] Mirono escooters: Don't bypass BMS if that's the question
[2023-07-17T16:00:31] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Haha it's always like that. So get off your phone
[2023-07-17T16:01:49] Mirono escooters: Si√´sta
[2023-07-17T16:03:23] Gordan Gizdic: Nah, im not bypassing it.
[2023-07-17T16:04:09] Gordan Gizdic: I was wondering if i could use a separate port BMS as a common port BMS. I actually cant, and thats logical, but wanted to know why. Now i know.
[2023-07-17T16:04:40] Gordan Gizdic: You loose overcharge protection in case i case one BMS fails and thats not a good thing
[2023-07-17T16:05:00] Gordan Gizdic: So no, not smart to use separate port bms as single port bms.
[2023-07-17T16:24:27] Mirono escooters: No, unsafe, no protection
[2023-07-17T16:26:07] Jonas: If you don't do it all time and balance too should be fine. Well zuna I did it again
[2023-07-17T16:26:25] Jonas: No clue what happened except boooom
[2023-07-17T16:26:47] Jonas: 75100 nr 12. Rip
[2023-07-17T16:27:06] Mirono escooters: 12???
[2023-07-17T16:27:14] Mirono escooters: You killed 12 already?
[2023-07-17T16:27:17] Jonas: Don't ask
[2023-07-17T16:27:25] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-07-17T16:27:36] Jonas: I can show u pcb
[2023-07-17T16:27:59] Jonas: Moab vs nuke ft. Vesc
[2023-07-17T16:28:09] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-07-17T16:28:14] Mirono escooters: You not repair em?
[2023-07-17T16:28:54] Jonas: <photos/photo_8955@17-07-2023_16-28-54.jpg>
[2023-07-17T16:29:11] Mirono escooters: A lil cleaning goes a long way
[2023-07-17T16:29:20] Jonas: Tru
[2023-07-17T16:29:38] Jonas: But I just pulled it out
[2023-07-17T16:29:42] Mirono escooters: Why not give it a shot repairing em
[2023-07-17T16:29:48] Mirono escooters: Or get a stronger vesc
[2023-07-17T16:30:03] Jonas: I did not ride one sec with that one
[2023-07-17T16:30:34] Mirono escooters: How
[2023-07-17T16:30:44] Jonas: <photos/photo_8956@17-07-2023_16-30-44.jpg>
[2023-07-17T16:30:57] Jonas: Masterpiece
[2023-07-17T16:31:26] Mirono escooters: Bro how
[2023-07-17T16:31:42] Jonas: Honestly
[2023-07-17T16:31:58] Jonas: I am good ad having badluck
[2023-07-17T16:32:27] Jonas: I just build my scooter
[2023-07-17T16:32:40] Jonas: Made the adapter
[2023-07-17T16:32:45] Jonas: Plugged in
[2023-07-17T16:32:58] Jonas: No booting Piep
[2023-07-17T16:33:57] Jonas: A few minutes before all was fine
[2023-07-17T16:34:13] Jonas: Calibrated script and all
[2023-07-17T16:35:05] Jonas: If u can repair that
[2023-07-17T16:35:09] Jonas: What u want
[2023-07-17T16:36:09] Jonas: I sent like few hundred ‚Ç¨ to zuna since he took so much afford with me
[2023-07-17T16:36:26] Jonas: I mean in dead Vescs ble etc
[2023-07-17T16:36:39] Mirono escooters: Maybe
[2023-07-17T16:36:42] Mirono escooters: Depends how far gone it ks
[2023-07-17T16:37:39] Jonas: Since I have central nerve issues soldering is like pain in the ass
[2023-07-17T16:37:52] Jonas: I can't feel dingers
[2023-07-17T16:37:57] Jonas: Finger
[2023-07-17T16:38:41] Jonas: So soldering pcb I decided is not my mission xd
[2023-07-17T16:40:04] Mirono escooters: Oof that must suck
[2023-07-17T17:02:59] AK: Ah shit wrong chat sorry
[2023-07-17T17:16:26] AK: It was the bms harness in the end, a balancer wire is propably again coming loose slowly
[2023-07-17T17:16:36] AK: No spectacular failures
[2023-07-17T17:17:34] AK: Man I wish I had the money for 21700 22s
[2023-07-17T17:22:16] Mirono escooters: Feel you
[2023-07-17T19:58:24] Ion: Old m365 I got for 50‚Ç¨ lol. Thing has 4200km with no maintenance and solid tires üíÄ
[2023-07-17T19:59:09] Ion: Racing slicks lol
[2023-07-17T20:01:50] Ion: What's the cheapest VESC I could put in that? It's 10s. Would I even gain anything
[2023-07-17T20:05:21] Mirono escooters: 75100
[2023-07-17T20:05:27] Mirono escooters: You'd gain something. Not much
[2023-07-17T20:05:30] Mirono escooters: Stock motor is..
[2023-07-17T20:07:15] Jan: A 4200km solid tire frame is basically a high risk of breaking. Aluminum has not an fatigue limit like steel. I would not recommend putting this one for high speed use
[2023-07-17T20:09:33] Ion: Interesting. So something like a snapped neck/stem is more likely because of fatigue caused by vibrations and bumps?
[2023-07-17T20:09:45] Jan: Yes
[2023-07-17T20:10:23] Jan: Every little vibration is a cycle of load, aluminum will break with enough loadcycles no matter how tiny the load is
[2023-07-17T20:13:31] Jan: The solid tire introduces so much stress at the green location (momentum) that it will snap here
[2023-07-17T20:14:21] Jan: Thats how it looks
[2023-07-17T20:20:04] Happy Giraffe: Meanwhile me with 10,000km 60kmh xiaomi proüòÖ didn't fear one bit. Only for the monorim suspension crapüòÅ
[2023-07-17T20:21:52] Mirono escooters: But you maintenance it and use suspension
[2023-07-17T20:21:56] puneDir: What u thing about 3000 km old g30?
[2023-07-17T20:22:23] puneDir: Mines broke from there
[2023-07-17T20:22:31] Mirono escooters: Lol, dont worry..
[2023-07-17T20:22:59] Ion: Yeah I hate solid tires. Would never use or recommend. Not for e scooter. But I guess there is also no (inexpensive and simple) way to detect this fatigue and nothing to do about it?
[2023-07-17T20:23:06] Jan: Has air filled tire, much less frame load
[2023-07-17T20:24:02] Mirono escooters: Solids suck so much
[2023-07-17T20:25:06] Jan: You could heat the frame up to 520¬∞C for 2hours and air cool it down
[2023-07-17T20:27:07] Ion: ... Would it help? :) Maybe I know someone...
[2023-07-17T20:29:39] Jan: Ok my numbers were wrong for soft annealing aluminum
[2023-07-17T20:29:43] Jan: "6061 aluminum is hot worked at a temperature range of 260‚Äì372 ¬∞C. Annealing can be conducted at a temperature of 413 ¬∞C for a period of 2‚Äì3 hrs. Afterward, the metal is cooled at a controlled temperature of 10 ¬∞C per hr until 260 ¬∞C is reached."
[2023-07-17T20:29:57] Mirono escooters: That's super hard to od
[2023-07-17T20:30:06] Jan: 413¬∞C instead of 520¬∞C
[2023-07-17T20:30:29] Jan: yes
[2023-07-17T20:30:33] Jan: Usually not worth it
[2023-07-17T20:37:53] Happy Giraffe: Yup
[2023-07-17T23:15:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i2c is kinda useless. it's designed for 100cm max in really quiet environnement. with phase wires nearby, if you can reach 20/30cm, it's already great üòÖ it may work on esk8, where vesc and display can be really close, but for me, it's impossible for escooter display. absolutly not designed for disturbed environnement (was made for pcb communication)

[2023-07-18T16:14:31] Mirono escooters: And set up both In Tab
[2023-07-18T16:14:34] Mirono escooters: U have to calibrate
[2023-07-18T18:13:25] Thierry: <photos/photo_8964@18-07-2023_18-13-25.jpg>
[2023-07-18T18:13:50] Finn: Shesh
[2023-07-18T18:18:11] Finn: But only 85v
[2023-07-18T18:18:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: What fet inside?
[2023-07-18T18:20:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think magnachip
[2023-07-18T18:30:41] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 100v (aka 22-23s wo brake current maybe will work if tvs works up to 100v also. If tvs same as in 80100 then 85v limit)
[2023-07-18T18:31:24] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Spintend 80/100 also works up to 20s
[2023-07-18T18:49:54] Happy Giraffe: Looks sexy, tho now even the original 75v100 is overkill for meüòÇ Only 42¬∞c mosfet max on summer
[2023-07-18T19:43:46] Thierry: Let us know how ot works when you tested it
[2023-07-18T19:51:22] Finn: Mother fucking spider inside daly bmsüòÇ
[2023-07-18T19:51:41] Finn: Dead now
[2023-07-18T19:52:05] Thierry: What about traction control on flipsky alu pcb 75100 and 75200?
[2023-07-18T19:55:01] Thierry: I've retrieved few picture on the group that didn't reinsured me üòÖ
[2023-07-18T19:56:50] Happy Giraffe: Time to set expectations. I say it holds 200A phase fine with 90A batt current on motor
[2023-07-18T19:56:54] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-07-18T19:59:40] Finn: SpiderüòÇüòÇ
[2023-07-18T20:00:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: You got a red spider Daly
[2023-07-18T20:01:52] Thierry: So not convince. I'm not sure to understand how it works. Would expect that when front wheel slip power will be reduced. But when I read comment on forum I feel that power is fed back to contro. Is it so?
[2023-07-18T20:17:58] Happy Giraffe: Temps?
[2023-07-18T20:18:18] Happy Giraffe: Lmao
[2023-07-18T20:19:31] Happy Giraffe: Testing some lights to vesc 12v output. With 54v this consumed 13.8mA power so 0.75w should be low enough haha. Its ridiculously bright for the power it takes.
[2023-07-18T20:20:25] AK: 1w led needs some very serious cooling
[2023-07-18T20:23:54] Happy Giraffe: Update: got better contact with my testing setup. It has actually 3 leds and consumes 1w / 3 so 0.33w each might not be that bad
[2023-07-18T20:24:04] Thierry: Thanks, so let's try. Do you have some settings advise? D√©fauts are good?
[2023-07-18T20:37:15] Konstantin: if (diff < TC_DIFF_MAX_PASS) diff = 0; if (diff > config.tc_max_diff) diff = config.tc_max_diff; current_out = utils_map(diff, 0.0, config.tc_max_diff, current_rel, 0.0)
[2023-07-18T20:40:47] Konstantin: float diff = rpm_local - rpm_lowest; if (diff < TC_DIFF_MAX_PASS) diff = 0; if (diff > config.tc_max_diff) diff = config.tc_max_diff; current_out = utils_map(diff, 0.0, config.tc_max_diff, current_rel, 0.0);
[2023-07-18T22:20:48] Thierry: If I understood correctly it means that it is on/off, this not a progressive current reduction
[2023-07-18T22:30:15] Konstantin: No, it's remap current
[2023-07-19T00:43:32] Finn: 140mm break disk for my 1200w blade
[2023-07-19T00:48:55] Happy Giraffe: Which model? Also thickness would be interesting
[2023-07-19T00:55:54] Finn: <photos/photo_8969@19-07-2023_00-55-54.jpg>
[2023-07-19T00:56:19] Finn: The Thickness doesnt stand there. I could measure tho
[2023-07-19T01:02:52] Jan: 8‚Ç¨ is quite the steal, not sure why every manufacturer pushes for floating rotors. At those sizes and thickness, it doesnt matter at all
[2023-07-19T01:03:49] Jan: Like over engineering for floating rotors but then zero effort for actual brake performance
[2023-07-19T01:05:05] Jan: Maximize Contact patch (thermal mass/friction contact for brake performance) + maximize material surface (for cooling) This rotor does both inverted
[2023-07-19T01:08:37] Jan: But for 8‚Ç¨, probably still good performance/price ratio
[2023-07-19T08:01:33] S1m 0n: It's 3mm. Do not buy it. It's bad. A friend buy it over Amazon for 60‚Ç¨
[2023-07-19T08:02:09] S1m 0n: <photos/photo_8970@19-07-2023_08-02-09.jpg>
[2023-07-19T08:04:55] S1m 0n: Oh it's a different one.. still not good
[2023-07-19T08:23:49] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I like to use these.
[2023-07-19T08:25:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 3mm is too much, that would become an issue with non-adjustable brake calipers.
[2023-07-19T08:26:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: These are about ~2mm, which is the typical thickness of a bike brake disc.
[2023-07-19T09:05:11] Mirono escooters: 2mm
[2023-07-19T11:50:23] JPPL: Almost all comercial you can find will be 1.8-~2mm
[2023-07-19T11:50:43] JPPL: Rare 3mm , normally costum production
[2023-07-19T12:03:11] Happy Giraffe: 3mm even fits to normal brakes lol?
[2023-07-19T12:05:26] Mirono escooters: Sometimes
[2023-07-19T12:05:34] Mirono escooters: And you cant have any slag or offset
[2023-07-19T15:23:24] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: again a new one with 85vüßê
[2023-07-19T15:26:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, it is rated for 20S. Seems they just try a better naming scheme to prevent people using too high voltage or smth
[2023-07-19T15:28:06] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: if it is then just as good as the current one then only recommendable I thinküëç
[2023-07-19T15:31:53] Finn: I like the power button
[2023-07-19T15:32:03] Finn: And the 200A
[2023-07-19T15:32:50] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: Power Button üî•
[2023-07-19T15:33:33] Finn: Shesh
[2023-07-19T15:34:32] Dedsec Enzo¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø: I hate having to turn off the battery with my smartphone every time
[2023-07-19T15:36:17] Mirono escooters: You can use smart BMS button or Vesc
[2023-07-19T15:39:35] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: It withstands water and air?
[2023-07-19T15:46:06] Mirono escooters: Sealed behind that cover, sure
[2023-07-19T15:56:14] Jan: The 20s alubox was already anticipated for a year now
[2023-07-19T15:58:57] Jan: The height is perfect but its one chunky box else ^^
[2023-07-19T15:59:14] Jan: Its nearly twice the size of the Tronic 250
[2023-07-19T15:59:43] Jan: i have 100x120
[2023-07-19T15:59:45] Jan: ^^
[2023-07-19T15:59:59] Jan: the box is like 75x1140
[2023-07-19T16:06:34] Jan: Tronic is 72x84x28mm
[2023-07-19T16:07:14] Jan: And pushing up to 11kW each
[2023-07-19T16:07:53] Jan: I have space up to 100x120x25mm everything above this will cause trouble
[2023-07-19T16:08:05] Jan: Was looking forward for spintends solution but for me its too big
[2023-07-19T16:08:21] Jan: MP2 maybe an option
[2023-07-19T16:08:28] Jan: but sourcing that stuff
[2023-07-19T16:08:29] Jan: ...
[2023-07-19T16:08:55] Jan: yeah can imagine
[2023-07-19T16:24:32] Mirono escooters: :(
[2023-07-19T16:24:39] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-07-19T16:25:12] Mirono escooters: I like it but yeah And I'm not making it ot commercially, I'm not doing warranty stuff
[2023-07-19T16:51:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: Even companies don‚Äôt offer warranty
[2023-07-19T16:59:05] Mirono escooters: Yeah, I know, but PayPal fuck me, and I don't take risk
[2023-07-19T16:59:13] Mirono escooters: If anyone want one from group ok, but I mean I won't make bulk
[2023-07-19T16:59:19] Mirono escooters: Maybe if toll powerboard
[2023-07-19T17:22:44] Face de Pin Suc√©: Maybe new C350 with flat caps ? Will receive in 2.5weeks, will take pictures :p
[2023-07-19T17:23:09] Jan: I would consider if it fits the dimension üëç

[2023-07-19T19:46:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is huashuo 1.8mR
[2023-07-19T20:14:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think it‚Äôs very good mosfet
[2023-07-19T20:15:14] Mirono escooters: But high crss
[2023-07-19T20:15:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: Nahhh, if control board is good, it works fine
[2023-07-19T20:16:17] Mirono escooters: Yes, I mean, on flipsky, oof ;)
[2023-07-19T20:16:29] Mirono escooters: It's nice to see to220 improving too
[2023-07-19T20:18:12] Mirono escooters: Lol u bought some there?
[2023-07-19T20:18:21] Mirono escooters: Much cheaper?
[2023-07-19T20:20:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not
[2023-07-19T20:20:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: But don‚Äôt pay tax for import
[2023-07-19T20:20:27] Mirono escooters: Aha
[2023-07-19T20:20:31] Mirono escooters: Smort. I need some
[2023-07-19T20:20:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: U want try with mp2?
[2023-07-19T20:21:04] Mirono escooters: Yeah and 75100 upgrade
[2023-07-19T20:21:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: @kawaiinekololis said it‚Äôs suce with flipsky too
[2023-07-19T20:21:22] puneDir: Stock 75100 mosfets are kinda fine
[2023-07-19T20:21:24] Mirono escooters: But mp2 idk, I have 1 pcb left, maybe use huasho, and after that wait for a alupcb
[2023-07-19T20:21:30] Mirono escooters: Good enough
[2023-07-19T20:22:03] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: meh
[2023-07-19T20:23:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: Huashuo goes much better?
[2023-07-19T20:29:10] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Less heat
[2023-07-19T20:36:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes but difference big or small
[2023-07-19T20:36:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Noticeable
[2023-07-19T20:37:04] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: So it's definitely not small
[2023-07-19T20:51:49] Jedich Nixan: Got em too but still not solder it, cuz I can't desolder the orig fets out üòî
[2023-07-19T20:53:20] Jedich Nixan: Will try it next time with heat gun, as I was told the zinc is very heat resistance.
[2023-07-19T21:05:18] Mirono escooters: Zinc?
[2023-07-19T21:05:21] Mirono escooters: More w, powa
[2023-07-19T21:11:03] Jedich Nixan: Zink (German and Netherland)
[2023-07-19T21:11:26] Jedich Nixan: Nope, Solderstation has enough Power, need to use a Heat Gun
[2023-07-19T21:17:06] Mirono escooters: Where on controller is that
[2023-07-19T21:17:14] Mirono escooters: Eh
[2023-07-19T21:17:18] Mirono escooters: It works for me lol
[2023-07-19T21:26:40] Jedich Nixan: dunno yet.. its only a message i was told... so last chance trying with heat gun, otherwise i will send it to some1
[2023-07-19T21:52:21] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <photos/photo_8976@19-07-2023_21-52-21.jpg>
[2023-07-19T21:52:23] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @Mirono_escooters
[2023-07-19T21:52:29] Mirono escooters: Uwu
[2023-07-19T21:52:50] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @LizardDoggo repaired his one and sent it to me, seems it is working now.
[2023-07-19T21:52:50] Finn: It works
[2023-07-19T21:52:52] Finn: Nice
[2023-07-19T21:53:09] Finn: This one mf dc dc chip
[2023-07-19T21:53:18] Mirono escooters: Atleast u repaired it
[2023-07-19T21:53:23] Finn: Yeah
[2023-07-19T21:53:37] Finn: Better then ali express refundüòÅ
[2023-07-19T21:53:49] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Works
[2023-07-19T21:53:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Now put together and drive
[2023-07-19T21:54:04] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Hopefully it did not rain again. I don't know
[2023-07-19T21:54:30] Mirono escooters: Brt
[2023-07-19T22:08:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: The e-brake üíÄüíÄüíÄ
[2023-07-19T22:09:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: -230A phase ebrake
[2023-07-19T22:10:50] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Dann ... My battery sucks
[2023-07-19T22:11:13] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Good that the cell holders should arrive tomorrow
[2023-07-19T22:15:02] Mirono escooters: Hehe
[2023-07-19T22:15:08] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-07-19T22:16:23] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: How tf do I access the second ESC on the vesc mobile app
[2023-07-19T22:16:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Oh I'm blind
[2023-07-19T22:16:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Huge can button
[2023-07-19T22:17:09] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-07-19T22:31:23] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Too bad I cannot turn off the 75100 with my key ignition, now my 75100 be like where did my buddy go
[2023-07-19T22:31:45] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But eh temporary
[2023-07-19T22:41:29] Jedich Nixan: Why?
[2023-07-19T22:41:50] Jedich Nixan: Not connected yet?
[2023-07-19T22:42:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Because it has no ignition feature?
[2023-07-19T22:42:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Of course you can modify it but that's not what I want.
[2023-07-20T09:50:17] Oreo huzky: My 75100 broke again because battery was low and bms cut out
[2023-07-20T09:51:20] Oreo huzky: And I have the mosfets at home but they are fake I will try replacing them maybe they hold the same as original because the 75100 is not under a lot of load
[2023-07-20T10:00:14] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Alu PCB or box
[2023-07-20T10:03:05] puneDir: Why 75100 blows with cutoffs?
[2023-07-20T10:09:51] Oreo huzky: Flipsky problem had the same with 75200
[2023-07-20T10:10:47] Oreo huzky: Ye maybe upgrade some time later to Alu because it‚Äôs my Daily driver so I want it to look as normal as possible
[2023-07-20T10:11:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Ah at least they are easy to repair
[2023-07-20T10:11:27] Oreo huzky: Currently have 500W motor on it and I‚Äôm pushing it to the limit with 75100
[2023-07-20T10:11:32] Oreo huzky: Yes
[2023-07-20T10:12:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Wonder how you guys manage this ,i was never able to blow one ,but i also dont try to ask 3shul powers from itü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ Like why you have cuts ?
[2023-07-20T10:13:30] Oreo huzky: Battery was at like 5% and bms didn‚Äôt like that
[2023-07-20T10:18:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Increase the voltage cut-off in VESC.
[2023-07-20T10:19:14] Oreo huzky: Ah
[2023-07-20T10:19:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Most of the time it even helps to let you drive much further
[2023-07-20T10:19:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Because it slowly decreases power until you reach the end voltage
[2023-07-20T10:19:57] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: So you're not running into the risk of causing the BMS to cut-off.
[2023-07-20T10:19:58] Oreo huzky: At the end i had to do the walk of shame with locked up motor for like 2km
[2023-07-20T10:20:30] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I hate it üò≠
[2023-07-20T10:21:18] puneDir: why it explodes when bms cut off?
[2023-07-20T10:21:23] puneDir: Whats the reason
[2023-07-20T10:21:42] Oreo huzky: Expecially if you have front motor and the scooter tips over all the time
[2023-07-20T10:23:03] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: design flaw
[2023-07-20T10:23:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes it happened to me so many times on my PRO2 with front motor... and back will always rise up when pushing it.
[2023-07-20T10:23:49] puneDir: What kind of issue
[2023-07-20T10:23:56] puneDir: And how to prevent
[2023-07-20T10:24:36] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Make sure your BMS will never cut off.
[2023-07-20T10:24:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: .
[2023-07-20T10:27:15] puneDir: can we add it?
[2023-07-20T13:30:04] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Why you didnt set voltage limits in vesc tool to make esc limit itself and dont spin motor under certain voltage? Why you didnt set bms to cut off lower than vesc turns motor off?
[2023-07-20T13:31:28] Mirono escooters: Maybe something else went wrong battery wise
[2023-07-20T15:38:52] Oreo huzky: This capacitor was laying loose in 75100 and one mosfet is dead I will replace it with different one but it should be the same
[2023-07-20T15:40:29] Mirono escooters: Ja
[2023-07-20T15:40:36] Mirono escooters: Always glue 75100 caps
[2023-07-20T15:43:01] Oreo huzky: Ooof
[2023-07-20T15:43:10] Oreo huzky: Do you think I can reuse it?
[2023-07-20T15:43:16] Oreo huzky: Or is it dead
[2023-07-20T15:43:53] Mirono escooters: Just replace
[2023-07-20T15:43:56] Mirono escooters: It costs like a cent
[2023-07-20T21:15:18] Ion: Found this while searching on Kleinanzeigen https://www.kleinanzeigen.de/s-anzeige/vesc-kompatibel-custom-esc-120v-400a-bzw-800a/2492864179-241-3477 Is this a good design? Someone DIY developed it. Is it someone from the group? Looks interesting for the size
[2023-07-20T21:18:22] Mirono escooters: Check out mp2 vesc
[2023-07-20T21:33:05] Happy Giraffe: And riding cells once to 2.7v is not the worlds end I think
[2023-07-20T21:33:19] Happy Giraffe: If emergency
[2023-07-20T21:37:35] Mirono escooters: Absolutely not
[2023-07-20T21:37:37] Mirono escooters: It's ok
[2023-07-20T21:37:44] Mirono escooters: But not much capacity between 3.2 and 2.75
[2023-07-20T21:39:32] Martin Kaktits: üò¢ stupid chemistry
[2023-07-20T22:54:53] Mirono escooters: Bwuh
[2023-07-20T22:55:08] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-07-21T00:02:32] Ion: Is it actually better (from the specs) than something that is commercially available? 120V/800A(battery? phase?) sounds good for something like that size. But idk.
[2023-07-21T00:03:07] Finn: Its way cheaper i would say.
[2023-07-21T00:03:17] Finn: Dont the 800A controller cost over 800‚Ç¨?
[2023-07-21T00:05:36] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Kwuh
[2023-07-21T00:10:32] Ion: idk, I didn't send a chat. The descriptions says it's a university project and there are 5 prototypes and its a "small production", but one could probably get in contact with him. It mentions 2 configurations, that change the height (1 power stage is 25mm, 2 are 50mm) and it's in a alu case.
[2023-07-21T00:12:19] Face de Pin Suc√©: I think it needs some serious testings
[2023-07-21T00:12:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: University project to make something 120V 800A work in this size
[2023-07-21T00:12:47] Face de Pin Suc√©: I'm curious
[2023-07-21T00:45:45] JPPL: I can order one üôà
[2023-07-21T01:08:28] JPPL: 120v 800a üòÇ boat rider
[2023-07-21T01:08:37] JPPL: Seems there's two versions
[2023-07-21T02:54:17] JPPL: 1stage or 2 stages
[2023-07-21T09:28:31] Mirono escooters: Or its the shit or its shit
[2023-07-21T09:30:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_8978@21-07-2023_09-30-33.jpg>
[2023-07-21T09:30:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: 400A is just mosfet specs
[2023-07-21T09:31:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not effective power
[2023-07-21T09:33:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: For me, those kind of powers need a lot of testings and tunes before getting something working well without fire

Does anybody know if it's possible to connect my Display (speedometer) from my IO Hawk Exit Cross 1.6 to the Flipsky 75100 that it shows the correct information ? I don't like the Design of the Flipsky Display. I would also buy another Display. THX in advance
[2023-07-21T13:59:05] Mirono escooters: What @BastiAkABumbelbee did was use iohawk Esc only for display and Vesc to power stuff
[2023-07-21T13:59:14] Mirono escooters: But the script from @aka13 should work?
[2023-07-21T14:00:15] Freddy: So you mean to use 2 Controller?
[2023-07-21T14:01:33] Freddy: I don't even thougt about that. Maybe a good Solution. THX, Buddy
[2023-07-21T14:12:12] AK: What he did was a deathwish
[2023-07-21T14:12:22] AK: No, it is not a good solution
[2023-07-21T14:12:49] Mirono escooters: Wha?
[2023-07-21T14:13:06] AK: Yes, it wors nicely, I have 1200km on the display rn with the script
[2023-07-21T14:13:11] AK: So far no issues
[2023-07-21T14:13:24] puneDir: @aka13 do you know how to make 75100 cut off proof?
[2023-07-21T14:13:31] AK: The e10 for 5 seconds on boot is tiresome, otherwise is ok
[2023-07-21T14:13:49] Freddy: Okay, any better solution? If you ask me, i would prefer a one Controller Solution because of the space
[2023-07-21T14:13:52] Mirono escooters: Set correct limits Poof done
[2023-07-21T14:14:05] puneDir: sometimes temp cutoffs
[2023-07-21T14:14:07] Mirono escooters: I'm super confused why it's a death wish, lol
[2023-07-21T14:14:13] Mirono escooters: That's ok..
[2023-07-21T14:14:32] puneDir: Turkey is too hot i mean i dont wanna kill my vesc
[2023-07-21T14:14:48] Mirono escooters: Bro 80* isnt ok? That's default
[2023-07-21T14:24:02] AK: Yes, you can connect the display dorectly to vesc, see the pinned messages
[2023-07-21T14:33:46] Freddy: THX Guys . I will check everything out. I think my Flipsky will get here next week üòç
[2023-07-21T14:34:38] Mirono escooters: Does the power gear function work?
[2023-07-21T14:35:14] AK: Ye
[2023-07-21T14:35:16] Freddy: My Display is Hardcore Oldschool
[2023-07-21T14:35:45] Mirono escooters: That's veery sick I love ur humour shitbox very reliable scooter

[2023-07-21T14:36:13] AK: How many wires does it have?
[2023-07-21T14:37:04] Freddy: I think it was 4 ... Plus, Ground, Speed and Light
[2023-07-21T14:37:23] Freddy: long ago i open this thing
[2023-07-21T14:37:37] AK: Won't work propably
[2023-07-21T14:37:38] Freddy: Gas is extra
[2023-07-21T14:37:57] Freddy: speed i mean
[2023-07-21T14:40:49] Freddy: That's what i meant. I think i have to buy another Display but dont know wich should i have to take. I know Vsett is working but it's not realy cheap
[2023-07-21T14:50:46] AK: You can send me the display and the esc, and I'll see what I can do
[2023-07-21T14:51:00] AK: For a beer and a D√∂ner
[2023-07-21T14:52:18] Freddy: üòÇüòÇüòÇyou're the man. Made my day. Beer and D√∂ner is always a good solution üòú
[2023-07-21T14:54:44] Freddy: Maybe i'll get back to you üòâ For now, i wait for the Flipsky and see what's Possible
[2023-07-21T14:57:45] AK: The cheap vsett/iohawk throttle should also work

[2023-07-21T16:40:19] AK: Can cmd does not work in 6.02
[2023-07-21T16:40:32] AK: You need 6.05 beta
[2023-07-21T16:41:33] puneDir: No battery cutoff
[2023-07-21T16:42:05] Mirono escooters: Just configure above bms
[2023-07-21T16:44:12] Thierry: Ok thanks, will wait
[2023-07-21T16:45:30] Thierry: On doc it is reported 6.00+

[2023-07-21T23:36:06] Simone: just for test, 16" motor and 72v Battery and 75100 vesc. Test in freewheel
[2023-07-21T23:37:33] Jedich Nixan: Stock 75100, or changed the Fets?
[2023-07-21T23:38:26] Mirono escooters: I'm very wondering too
[2023-07-21T23:40:04] Simone: stock but unboxed and cooled
[2023-07-21T23:43:39] Jedich Nixan: How is it cooled? Like mounted it directly to the Frame?
[2023-07-21T23:45:33] Jedich Nixan: Depends. If it's build from one Piece then it might be a little higher. And depends also what kind of Alloy.
[2023-07-21T23:48:43] Jedich Nixan: You also could build it with 2 or 3 Parts, welding it together and voila..done. there are many ways how to get it done
[2023-07-22T00:15:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: One piece ,rest would be less interesting
[2023-07-22T00:16:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also one piece would end more sturdy,and i can only guess quality is highend ,since he plans life above 60kmh on it
[2023-07-22T00:17:13] Mirono escooters: Or The stem stainless steel Rest alu
[2023-07-22T00:17:24] Mirono escooters: Like konyk. New version will do that
[2023-07-22T00:17:36] Mirono escooters: Idk how, but ppl managed to break the stem
[2023-07-22T00:17:48] Mirono escooters: And it screws into each other with a sturdy bolt. Very. Sturdy

[2023-07-22T08:41:02] Newuser G: Yesssss
[2023-07-22T08:43:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: I‚Äôm curious about the cost of this piece, since the block of alu you machines from is giant
[2023-07-22T09:00:01] Newuser G: Well‚Ä¶very expensive,‚Ä¶ 150‚Ç¨ of material, design and CNC machining around 600‚Ç¨ ü´£ a friend of mine has a haas machine, and in his spare time, he designed and produced it
[2023-07-22T09:05:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: 600‚Ç¨ for a fork? Wtf why that much for one fork
[2023-07-22T09:22:32] Jedich Nixan: Bc he can
[2023-07-22T09:27:19] Newuser G: the cost is high for the time it took, the design‚Ä¶
[2023-07-22T09:30:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: Design is pretty easy, who do this as job like @AJAJ1992 would take 1h max to done it .
[2023-07-22T09:34:22] Jan: What i would do 1. Design of space model 2. Topology optimization (You need to know the loads, thats the hard part) 3. Design now the right fork 4. Make a 2D drawing with tolerance 5. Send step and drawing to someone to manufacture
[2023-07-22T09:35:04] Jan: Maybe 2hours for all
[2023-07-22T10:47:05] Newuser G: I don't have the knowledge for all these things and I trusted those who do it for work üòú
[2023-07-22T10:48:05] Newuser G: of course, if a person draws and designs it himself, then he saves money
[2023-07-22T10:48:38] Mirono escooters: Still a piece of art ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2023-07-22T11:58:30] Newuser G: Thx Miro!!üòâ
[2023-07-22T12:11:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I dont know or just didn't saw that ,not sure what you mean
[2023-07-22T12:11:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Stainless so heavy
[2023-07-22T12:29:47] Mirono escooters: The piece wich go into scoot
[2023-07-22T12:29:50] Mirono escooters: The round tube
[2023-07-22T12:30:06] Mirono escooters: Sharkset also make it stainless steel..
[2023-07-22T12:47:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I seeüòÖ
[2023-07-22T12:48:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well i dont really like shark alsoüòÖ
[2023-07-22T12:54:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Konyk could be better ,like rear swing arm material is great ,but Even there ,longest bolt thread is also in the arm, atleast it has bushing But small L shaped part what holds shock and body is from joke material, and as its bolted ,now that's the other jokeüòÖü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ but if you point out things what's not lovely they help you leave chat ü§£
[2023-07-22T12:55:18] Mirono escooters: It's the best suspension as yet
[2023-07-22T12:55:32] Mirono escooters: And front is next level. I meant dereza.
[2023-07-22T12:55:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well , I think rear Spanish works far better
[2023-07-22T12:56:05] Mirono escooters: I can perfectly criticize stuff in the chat, admin and I are friends
[2023-07-22T12:56:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But make body more long than any and you cant even buy / ugly

[2023-07-22T22:25:35] Finn: Yeah
[2023-07-22T22:27:34] Oreo huzky: The 6S lipo can do 80A I‚Äôm a bit to scared to put it in

[2023-07-22T22:37:30] Oreo huzky: Is that still bad?
[2023-07-22T22:39:25] Oreo huzky: I will try with 6S to see if it disappears
[2023-07-22T22:42:08] Finn: Better
[2023-07-22T22:43:34] Oreo huzky: Uhm there are tiny sparks between mosfet legs

[2023-07-22T22:50:06] Oreo huzky: I cleaned it now I think it was metal shavings
[2023-07-22T22:53:14] Oreo huzky: Is it normal that the abs counts go up when it‚Äôs just sitting and doing nothing
[2023-07-22T22:54:11] Finn: Maybe just heat the legs and apply solder to it
[2023-07-22T22:54:27] Oreo huzky: Ye
[2023-07-22T22:55:11] Oreo huzky: The solder job is really bad on this one because I used copper wire to remove old solder but the copper wire just wouldn‚Äôt suck up the solder
[2023-07-23T00:31:46] Mirono escooters: BroüíÄ

[2023-07-23T09:12:46] Mirono escooters: Idk, I just remember you shared once

[2023-07-23T17:45:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: Depends by cooling and load
[2023-07-23T17:46:37] Finn: If cooling isnt the problem i would say 130A phase. Idk battery why does that matter?
[2023-07-23T19:15:07] Mirono escooters: Lol, because phase is usually peak, and batt is continuous
[2023-07-23T19:24:41] Finn: Then recommend smth for 75100
[2023-07-23T19:26:13] Mirono escooters: 40-50 if bolted
[2023-07-23T19:47:34] Ofek üê•: 70A with aluminum block same size as it's box
[2023-07-23T19:52:35] Ofek üê•: This is well enough for 16S battery with 50A discharge if bolted to the body Secure components for sure
[2023-07-23T19:53:13] Mirono escooters: Jeeez
[2023-07-23T19:53:16] Finn: Wouldnt do it as it easily bends the legs of mosfet
[2023-07-23T19:53:23] Finn: Had it 3 times
[2023-07-23T19:54:05] Ofek üê•: Without securing the board and capacitors it'll distroy itself

[2023-07-23T22:19:10] Finn: What are those wires rated for?
[2023-07-23T22:19:50] Simone: are you talking about the size?
[2023-07-23T22:21:10] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-07-23T22:21:14] Mirono escooters: How much amps max? Yes
[2023-07-23T22:22:58] Simone: the cables seem to me to be 10mm¬≤...I haven't measured them yet
[2023-07-23T22:37:12] Finn: Yes
[2023-07-23T22:37:25] Finn: Push Mp2 to its limit

[2023-07-23T22:51:48] Martin Kaktits: ou, wow. Phases no longer go trough the axle? didnt even know that is possible. Kinda makes sense now that i think about it. Foken noice.
[2023-07-23T22:59:58] D J: that would be an interesting project but I don't have the machinery to do that. Would have to make the suspension tables new and then apply a good suspension
[2023-07-23T23:00:48] Mirono escooters: Yah, but so fun
[2023-07-23T23:00:56] Mirono escooters: Not best frame for it anyway
[2023-07-23T23:36:51] Unknown: Dropout size and rim width? Where did you get them?

[2023-07-23T23:55:54] Mirono escooters: Poor dropouts
[2023-07-23T23:59:44] Simone: about 150mm...they improved the "case" before I could max out the 65H
[2023-07-24T00:27:46] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Less or equal 100a continious
[2023-07-24T00:31:52] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I have the same power motors, but more torque kv one
[2023-07-24T00:37:49] Tommy: Nice pizza cutterüòÅ

[2023-07-24T00:59:13] Mirono escooters: Trust the dropouts?
[2023-07-24T01:02:49] Happy Giraffe: Minimum a torque washer with that lid...they are ok for ~50Nm
[2023-07-24T01:03:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes but still 60mm engine
[2023-07-24T01:04:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because is already fucking heavy, don‚Äôt want to make it more
[2023-07-24T01:04:35] Mirono escooters: 7 ugga buggas of torque and it'll hold.
[2023-07-24T01:14:04] D J: what motors are you using now? my originals motors are already over a lot now üòÖ but I still don't know which engines to buy

[2023-07-24T11:01:13] Finn: Oh noüòÇ what was it
[2023-07-24T11:01:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Same as this video, but much bigger battery
[2023-07-24T11:02:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: I can‚Äôt tell you which factory it isü•≤
[2023-07-24T11:04:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: really ? this video show some confidence üòÅ
[2023-07-24T13:27:57] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I did custom washers and nuts to put this motor in a segway fork
[2023-07-24T13:29:06] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: <photos/photo_9002@24-07-2023_13-29-06.jpg>

[2023-07-24T13:30:05] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Its not fit as it is with original nuts etc
[2023-07-24T13:30:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: I though fork opening was just 132
[2023-07-24T13:30:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: How this motor fits
[2023-07-24T13:30:31] Mirono escooters: You the man
[2023-07-24T13:32:26] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: This motor is 142mm dropout. The front fork of the Segway moves apart in width due to the tensile force of the upper arc, which is connected between the levers. It is in tension in the drain inside, but it is trying to push the levers apart
[2023-07-24T13:33:05] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: When the fork is removed from the suspension, it is wider in the relaxed state than in the installed
[2023-07-24T13:33:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: it is enough to make the new axles longer in front
[2023-07-24T13:34:39] Simone: great job...i'm fascinated by your project üòâ
[2023-07-24T13:35:02] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: but to install this motor on the rear levers, then there you already need to cut them in half, put the motor and weld levers again
[2023-07-24T13:35:45] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Rear side is a hard workü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-07-24T14:33:49] Simone: isn't it better to make a new one?
[2023-07-24T14:36:24] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: This is one of the options. Not the easiest
[2023-07-24T16:28:24] Zak: What is the axle size of original segway motor? Any pics of inside motor and magnet dimensions
[2023-07-24T16:38:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_9003@24-07-2023_16-38-24.jpg>

[2023-07-24T16:44:31] Happy Giraffe: Only issue is lack of cooling that I will solve
[2023-07-24T16:44:56] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-07-24T16:45:07] Happy Giraffe: People have been running 180A phase with oil filled but I dont want that to the thin motor connector amd gears
[2023-07-24T16:45:27] Happy Giraffe: Lol 60Nm is enough for your weight

[2023-07-24T20:52:29] Mirono escooters: Batt not fully charging? Shitty batt?
[2023-07-24T20:53:10] Shoaib: On the charger green light comes up
[2023-07-24T20:53:44] Mirono escooters: Yes but what's it voltage lol
[2023-07-24T20:53:50] Mirono escooters: Led on charger doesn't care
[2023-07-24T20:54:06] Mirono escooters: Or your charger doesn't go to 4.2v per cell Or your Vesc misreports voltage Or your BMS cuts charging for some reason
[2023-07-24T21:57:45] Happy Giraffe: Checked it, 100$ not bad
[2023-07-24T22:16:04] Finn: @PaoloWu 800w mini blade with ninebot controller and 005 shunts should work pretty well or whats your opinion? Mosfet will be swapped anyways but i dont find a guide for resistor swap on the new g30 controller with screw terminalsüòÅ

[2023-07-25T11:44:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: Thunder for performance

[2023-07-25T11:44:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: Bronco Vnom for autonomy
[2023-07-25T11:44:36] Oreo huzky: But I can‚Äôt find a reseller that sells just the frame
[2023-07-25T11:44:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: Nami for mixed use and confort
[2023-07-25T11:45:03] Oreo huzky: I wanted it at first because I really like the design but I could find any one that sells it
[2023-07-25T11:45:26] Oreo huzky: I don‚Äôt really like nami because of the strange battery bay
[2023-07-25T11:45:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: I only talk about frames ;)
[2023-07-25T11:46:04] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, need to buy a used one and sell the parts

[2023-07-25T11:51:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: Amazing
[2023-07-25T11:51:59] Oreo huzky: Is it possible to buy all the spare parts for Thunder frame and build one?
[2023-07-25T11:52:13] Oreo huzky: Is that good price seemed kinda steep
[2023-07-25T11:53:41] Oreo huzky: Ah yes old laptop overheating from software update

[2023-07-25T12:05:39] Oreo huzky: Wich Mac OS do you have?
[2023-07-25T12:05:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: Olds MacBook are a trash :(
[2023-07-25T12:06:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: The cost absolutely don‚Äôt worth it

[2023-07-25T12:59:34] Jonas: Anybody around who can tell me which fw to use on a maker base 75100? O always had no problem with V2 but it seems like it's not correct anymore (even there was no V2 on PCB). Otherwise I have no idea why a brand new one just killed itself. Just don't want the next one to do the same ofc. I think I had the correct one since first one I tried didn't recognize throttle/brake input the next one did recognize it.
[2023-07-25T13:00:39] Jonas: Still did not have a testride just had a shortcut out of nowhere
[2023-07-25T13:18:00] Mirono escooters: Did u reverse rotation direction
[2023-07-25T13:41:55] Jedich Nixan: Big sur I think. It's a MacBook Air 2016 or 2017.
[2023-07-25T13:46:01] Oreo huzky: Should be fine
[2023-07-25T13:52:00] Happy Giraffe: Looking the photo made me hungryüòê
[2023-07-25T13:54:11] Happy Giraffe: I have 2016, they can do bootcamp windows/Mac so that makes vesc tool usable. New M based apple cpus aren't compatible with that I think
[2023-07-25T14:03:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: Trust me, I don‚Äôt like it hahaha , he ordered
[2023-07-25T14:58:51] Gabe Enzo: Make your own for cheaper
[2023-07-25T14:58:56] Finn: Sure
[2023-07-25T14:59:02] Finn: Would be more stable then this shit
[2023-07-25T14:59:16] Gabe Enzo: it's so short
[2023-07-25T14:59:19] Gabe Enzo: it's like fat

[2023-07-25T15:02:05] Finn: Xd
[2023-07-25T15:27:19] Happy Giraffe: I wonder how hard would it be to design own frame from scratch, you could copy others geometry etcü§î
[2023-07-25T15:28:08] Finn: i will prob gonna make a basic standing frame and then the battery case
[2023-07-25T15:29:18] Mirono escooters: Drawing it ez Making, uh

[2023-07-25T15:32:56] Happy Giraffe: Lockable battery case would be cool. Once I learn to cnc and weld thats on my list for the ebikeüòÅ then can leave battery on bike for shop trips if bike locked.
[2023-07-25T16:40:27] Cologne: Hey Field weakninng : One question and that is what are the best settings for a 10 Inches brushless Motor ?
[2023-07-25T16:44:07] Gabe Enzo: You didn't mention anything else except size.
[2023-07-25T16:47:31] Cologne: G30 Flipsky 75100 10s+6s battery 450 w Motor
[2023-07-25T16:48:30] Mirono escooters: There are no best settings lol
[2023-07-25T16:48:46] Mirono escooters: It all depends on each one and their setup
[2023-07-25T16:50:03] Gabe Enzo: and weight
[2023-07-25T16:53:28] Thierry: Best settings would probably be the one that you will define after several tests.
[2023-07-25T17:00:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: true
[2023-07-25T17:00:19] Mirono escooters: Ya not guessing
[2023-07-25T17:00:39] Thierry: Yes temp sensor help but take also care of battery amps, if bms cutoff your flipsky will die
[2023-07-25T17:00:47] Face de Pin Suc√©: true
[2023-07-25T17:01:15] Mirono escooters: Lol, obv set currents viable to your setup
[2023-07-25T17:01:19] Mirono escooters: That's.. basic..
[2023-07-25T17:02:24] Thierry: It was ro highlight that fw will exceed battery amps setting
[2023-07-25T17:02:50] Mirono escooters: XD fair enough
[2023-07-25T18:12:38] Ion: Is FW current not added to battery current? Is it included? I thought like 30A batt and 10A FW is 40A, no?
[2023-07-25T18:19:54] Thierry: Flipsky doesn't care battery amps
[2023-07-25T18:26:58] Cologne: THX GUYS ! But i have 30a FW and 90 DUty Start...Better DUTY START MORE OR LESS THEN 90% ?
[2023-07-25T18:29:41] Thierry: I let 90
[2023-07-25T18:30:08] Cologne: THX A LOT ! 30 a or less or more?
[2023-07-25T18:30:13] Thierry: Tried on road 75100 and 75100 alu
[2023-07-25T18:33:54] Thierry: It would help to have I batt max on trip to monitor
[2023-07-25T18:34:23] Thierry: I connect to smart bms to check I max
[2023-07-25T18:36:24] Thierry: Better to check while driving
[2023-07-25T18:36:42] Cologne: 30 a or less or more in FW ? üòò
[2023-07-25T18:37:16] Cologne: i havbe temp sensor
[2023-07-25T18:37:34] Cologne: how much? 20a?
[2023-07-25T18:37:50] Thierry: Too small to read when I'm driving
[2023-07-25T18:37:50] Cologne: dont know really
[2023-07-25T18:38:44] Gabe Enzo: Screen record
[2023-07-25T18:38:51] Cologne: more the 30a is ok? or useless?
[2023-07-25T18:39:23] Thierry: I used to do that before to have smart bms
[2023-07-25T18:40:19] Cologne: more A
[2023-07-25T18:40:21] Cologne: :)
[2023-07-25T18:40:49] Thierry: I don't know if you can expect much with single motor
[2023-07-25T18:41:08] Thierry: Much heat for sure but speed I'm not sure
[2023-07-25T18:41:21] Cologne: better dual?
[2023-07-25T18:41:24] Cologne: much better?
[2023-07-25T18:41:30] Cologne: COMFORT IS OK?
[2023-07-25T18:44:06] Cologne: ty ! and is the drive comfort ok?
[2023-07-25T18:45:25] Gabe Enzo: only monorim motors are shit
[2023-07-25T18:45:29] Gabe Enzo: their suspension is fine
[2023-07-25T18:45:57] Gabe Enzo: You can have the same speed. the issue is heat.
[2023-07-25T18:46:32] Gabe Enzo: Same speed but not for long
[2023-07-25T18:46:51] Thierry: Monorim motors are not so bad with tyres and dual motors
[2023-07-25T18:47:22] Gabe Enzo: People torture motors and whine when they burn. obv if you put 3000w into a 500 motor it'll die
[2023-07-25T18:47:32] Gabe Enzo: Monorim is only 500w nominal
[2023-07-25T18:47:43] Cologne: <photos/photo_9021@25-07-2023_18-47-43.jpg>

[2023-07-25T21:32:21] Face de Pin Suc√©: And rim way too large
[2023-07-25T21:32:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: Beast on drag race, but useless for pure performance
[2023-07-25T21:50:21] Cologne: Yes it is 25,4 cm But When i set the Wheel Diamter to 254 mm it is tooooo much the Display
[2023-07-25T21:50:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: Then just measure the diameter
[2023-07-25T21:51:33] Cologne: Sorry how ? Thx
[2023-07-25T21:51:46] Cologne: How you mean
[2023-07-25T21:52:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: Measure by yourself the diameter of your wheel

[2023-07-25T22:49:02] Mirono escooters: Moh
[2023-07-25T22:49:12] Mirono escooters: Your old batt was more dangerous so, what's the issue ü§ì
[2023-07-25T22:49:13] Cologne: What Must i set 16 or 30 Poles ?

[2023-07-25T22:53:43] Mirono escooters: That's why you tape it off
[2023-07-25T22:55:01] Oreo huzky: Only have good tape don‚Äôt want to waste it for safety will just get some packing tape I guess
[2023-07-25T22:56:18] Mirono escooters: Imagine "wasting" 5‚Ç¨ of tape for safety
[2023-07-25T22:56:19] Mirono escooters: Pft
[2023-07-25T22:56:22] Mirono escooters: And a expensive batt
[2023-07-25T22:58:40] Oreo huzky: It‚Äôs not the 5‚Ç¨ it‚Äôs the shipping time

[2023-07-25T23:19:53] Oreo huzky: In foc
[2023-07-25T23:27:49] Yosi Moreno: Where in foc ? Does it says phase filter or it has different name
[2023-07-26T00:15:38] Oreo huzky: FOC and in the slider under foc there should be two sliders
[2023-07-26T00:16:21] Oreo huzky: <video_file>
[2023-07-26T00:18:12] Yosi Moreno: I don't have it üòû
[2023-07-26T00:35:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: You need to update your app
[2023-07-26T00:56:16] Yosi Moreno: Thanks i will update

[2023-07-26T01:07:01] Unknown: 20s 5 p battery
[2023-07-26T01:08:36] Unknown: Dose anyone know
[2023-07-26T01:09:14] Unknown: Wat website
[2023-07-26T08:37:32] Jan: Only commissioned batteries possible and 20s5p will not fit unless you cnc the frame
[2023-07-26T08:41:23] Face de Pin Suc√©: In which country do you live?
[2023-07-26T09:12:28] Jan: He is US
[2023-07-26T09:12:48] Jan: Would need a 16s5p p42a
[2023-07-26T09:13:02] Jan: BMS on the front
[2023-07-26T09:16:16] Face de Pin Suc√©: Oh okay, can't ship to US
[2023-07-26T09:34:28] Mirono escooters: Can fit up to 18s w good layout thoüôäü§ì
[2023-07-26T09:49:17] Jan: As i understood he is completely new to this but brings some soldering skills
[2023-07-26T09:49:48] Mirono escooters: I can make one but, shipping would be funü§ì
[2023-07-26T09:49:59] Mirono escooters: Everyone has to start somewhere
[2023-07-26T13:55:41] Gabe Enzo: I used clear tape instead of kapton for my batt. unsure if it lets heat pass thru right
[2023-07-26T13:55:49] Gabe Enzo: Batt is always hotter than 40¬∞ when I get home
[2023-07-26T13:56:03] Mirono escooters: I wouldn't trust clear packing tape with that lol
[2023-07-26T13:56:20] Gabe Enzo: it's heavy taped and also with electrical tape
[2023-07-26T13:56:39] Gabe Enzo: The terminal rails can touch the frame if the tape wears down so I went heavy on it
[2023-07-26T13:56:48] Gabe Enzo: The rails won't hold the magnetic strips cause I shaved the battery so it fits.
[2023-07-26T13:56:52] Gabe Enzo: lots of plastic gone.
[2023-07-26T13:57:33] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2023-07-26T13:58:01] Gabe Enzo: only way to fit in a pro 2 frame
[2023-07-26T13:58:09] Gabe Enzo: would rebuild the battery but no spot welder
[2023-07-26T13:58:10] Mirono escooters: Kapton is made for it and pretty resistant Packing tape is.. packing tape
[2023-07-26T13:58:13] Mirono escooters: But you do you
[2023-07-26T13:58:25] Mirono escooters: Atleast pvc wrap it üò≠
[2023-07-26T13:58:30] Gabe Enzo: like I can tell it hold for years, but I'm worried it will kill the batt
[2023-07-26T13:58:36] Gabe Enzo: Cause it's so much coating
[2023-07-26T13:58:39] Gabe Enzo: idk...
[2023-07-26T13:58:49] Mirono escooters: Lol no
[2023-07-26T13:58:58] Mirono escooters: BMS has temp sensors, so what you worry about
[2023-07-26T13:59:09] Gabe Enzo: even when I shorted the shunts ya?
[2023-07-26T13:59:20] Mirono escooters: üòê
[2023-07-26T13:59:23] Gabe Enzo: cause I had NO idea that that would get rid of short protection
[2023-07-26T13:59:28] Gabe Enzo: At all
[2023-07-26T13:59:51] Gabe Enzo: I hope those have nothing to do with temp sensors. I'll ask Vallety
[2023-07-26T14:00:02] Mirono escooters: Bro
[2023-07-26T14:00:09] Mirono escooters: A shunt has nothing to do with temp sensor
[2023-07-26T14:00:24] Mirono escooters: Moh who would've thought it üòê
[2023-07-26T14:00:47] Mirono escooters: Maybe don't play with such dangerous toys if that little knowledge Dont take this wrong. It's friend advise..
[2023-07-26T14:01:06] Gabe Enzo: My home set on fire from lipos before
[2023-07-26T14:01:34] Mirono escooters: Then you should maybe know better
[2023-07-26T14:01:45] Mirono escooters: Oh well, your nickel/wires/MOSFETs will act as a fuse üëç
[2023-07-26T14:01:54] Gabe Enzo: ESC just arrived
[2023-07-26T14:01:58] Mirono escooters: If I were you I'd use a fuse in between but hey
[2023-07-26T14:02:08] Gabe Enzo: no thermal paste tho. so I will not mod it yet
[2023-07-26T14:02:10] Mirono escooters: Thats all my knowledge I can say
[2023-07-26T14:02:13] Gabe Enzo: right
[2023-07-26T14:02:34] Gabe Enzo: actually i didn't use thermal paste for a week and the esc never surpassed 40¬∞ even after riding for an hour
[2023-07-26T14:02:37] Gabe Enzo: how? I don't know
[2023-07-26T14:02:42] Gabe Enzo: Makes no sense to me lol
[2023-07-26T14:02:56] Gabe Enzo: I screwed that shit on TIGHT
[2023-07-26T14:08:04] Gabe Enzo: came with 20S NCEP's. I'm lucky.
[2023-07-26T14:08:08] Gabe Enzo: Less work for me.
[2023-07-26T14:11:10] Mirono escooters: Not Xiaomi group
[2023-07-26T16:27:49] Zak: Does anyone have the link to segway gt1/2 indicator switch
[2023-07-26T16:44:33] Cologne: Hey i take this ,But now is tooooo much ,Why ? 10 Inch Motor Really 30 poles ?
[2023-07-26T16:45:51] Cologne: I have a temp Sensor

[2023-07-26T16:47:13] Cologne: Is dangerous
[2023-07-26T16:47:16] Cologne: ?
[2023-07-26T17:17:24] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I put 244mm for my 10x3 as well and it seems to be matching
[2023-07-26T17:19:57] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I think I need sum field weakening. Only 110A battery because of duty
[2023-07-26T17:20:24] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: well tomorrow in the morning I will try with fw, but def need to watch current on BMS.
[2023-07-26T17:24:59] Mirono escooters: Only xD
[2023-07-26T17:25:25] Mirono escooters: Isn't your batt just sagging too much
[2023-07-26T17:25:27] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: the voltage drop on 3p is insane XD
[2023-07-26T17:25:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes it is

[2023-07-26T20:28:58] Mirono escooters: Pole pairs or poles
[2023-07-26T20:29:03] Mirono escooters: Pole pairs is /2

[2023-07-26T21:08:37] Happy Giraffe: Gonna slap this to ebike esc box and paint it metallicüòÇ
[2023-07-26T21:08:44] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-07-26T21:16:58] Cologne: Are These Settings ok ? I have the Stock battery 10s+ 6s (21700)
[2023-07-26T21:16:59] Cologne: <photos/photo_9035@26-07-2023_21-16-59.jpg>
[2023-07-26T21:21:15] Happy Giraffe: Put 30A battery current first
[2023-07-26T21:22:02] Happy Giraffe: And start with no battery regen at first to see how scooter handles. Need mechanical brake to work properly
[2023-07-26T21:22:08] Cologne: Ok ,too much ? I want Max Power üòÄMy Batterie have Bypass
[2023-07-26T21:22:54] Mirono escooters: Stock no like 50
[2023-07-26T21:22:56] Happy Giraffe: There's a reason why they don't take more power from stock battery. Try low first and increase slowly
[2023-07-26T21:22:58] Mirono escooters: Max 40
[2023-07-26T21:23:25] Happy Giraffe: 10s 50A would be 2000w+ üòÇüôà

[2023-07-26T21:24:55] Happy Giraffe: Start low and slowly increase but you need to know what you are doing. Stock battery with bms bypassed can cook or motor cook
[2023-07-26T21:25:47] Cologne: I feel it with My Hand ,i Wait for My Bluetooth to Check
[2023-07-26T21:26:22] Cologne: Thx ,But When the Motor is cold ?

[2023-07-27T14:08:30] Finn: I like how empty the logic board is
[2023-07-27T14:08:56] Mirono escooters: That's reaaaly empty lol
[2023-07-27T14:09:05] Mirono escooters: But sometimes that doesn't matter For my boat, no care
[2023-07-27T14:09:15] Mirono escooters: You'll sell em?
[2023-07-27T14:10:32] Konstantin: 120v? Somebody said what phase shunts, bad on 75+v
[2023-07-27T14:11:08] Mirono escooters: Rip mp2 then
[2023-07-27T14:12:35] Mirono escooters: Didn't Paolo say that
[2023-07-27T14:12:37] Mirono escooters: It's the first time I heard that too
[2023-07-27T14:13:41] JPPL: I will buy for testing
[2023-07-27T14:14:04] JPPL: It's really small batch
[2023-07-27T14:14:04] Mirono escooters: Me want one

[2023-07-27T14:14:29] Lutz: its ina241 up to 120v spikes but 24S max
[2023-07-27T14:14:58] AK: You literally are promoting carders washing money. He orders with stolen credit cards, which bounce after a month or so, and you send him legit clean money
[2023-07-27T14:15:16] AK: Best part - now your adress and name are assotiated with carders
[2023-07-27T14:15:20] Lutz: schematics are close to vesc75/300
[2023-07-27T14:15:24] AK: Even better - you are liable
[2023-07-27T14:15:25] JPPL: 26 max I think from audio teceived
[2023-07-27T14:15:34] JPPL: But I'm working can eat well,
[2023-07-27T14:15:39] JPPL: But normal 20s
[2023-07-27T14:15:46] Lutz: yeah 26 can work but own risk
[2023-07-27T14:15:51] AK: Best - carders now have gotten your legit data and adress, and you PAID for it
[2023-07-27T14:15:57] JPPL: True
[2023-07-27T14:16:13] Finn: Resell those things.
[2023-07-27T14:16:20] AK: Can't make this up, advertising this in a public group
[2023-07-27T14:16:21] Lutz: you need very low impedance to battery then
[2023-07-27T14:16:49] JPPL: Let's rock Lutz!
[2023-07-27T14:16:55] JPPL: Welcome
[2023-07-27T14:17:08] JPPL: You joined :)
[2023-07-27T14:17:16] Mirono escooters: Defenitely whitewashing No one has backdoor access
[2023-07-27T14:17:57] Mirono escooters: Heh, should've know better Weird he also sends it in this group?
[2023-07-27T14:18:17] Mirono escooters: Maybe add some caps?
[2023-07-27T14:18:19] AK: Maybe this is all 4d chess and he is the carder in question himself
[2023-07-27T14:18:21] Mirono escooters: What does 1 Vesc cost?
[2023-07-27T14:19:37] Lutz: depends if one or two powerstages
[2023-07-27T14:19:53] Lutz: one controller can control 2 powerstages
[2023-07-27T14:20:16] Mirono escooters: 1
[2023-07-27T14:20:21] Mirono escooters: Or no wait, 2 powzrstages is awd
[2023-07-27T14:20:24] Mirono escooters: Then defenitely 2
[2023-07-27T14:22:21] Mirono escooters: Would be perfect for my boat That or mp2 dual
[2023-07-27T14:22:28] Mirono escooters: But mp2 with the to220 annoys me
[2023-07-27T14:22:29] Lutz: first batch was but pricey with shipping eu wide 500 ;o later i can reduce
[2023-07-27T14:23:14] Lutz: for boat i have watercooled version :o
[2023-07-27T14:23:31] Mirono escooters: 500??
[2023-07-27T14:23:34] Mirono escooters: Oh perfect
[2023-07-27T14:23:44] Mirono escooters: BCS I was gonna design a watercooled heatsink anyway
[2023-07-27T14:23:52] Mirono escooters: I need to drive 2 1500w motors (+-)
[2023-07-27T14:23:56] Finn: For mp2
[2023-07-27T14:24:07] Mirono escooters: Saves me work
[2023-07-27T14:24:27] Mirono escooters: We need mp2 x alupcb
[2023-07-27T14:24:27] Ion: Hi, cool that you are here. I saw your project on Kleinanzeigen and posted it here a week ago :)
[2023-07-27T14:24:35] Finn: Yeah
[2023-07-27T14:24:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: mp2 has phase on negative, not phases
[2023-07-27T14:24:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: Let me explain for who don‚Äôt know
[2023-07-27T14:25:00] Mirono escooters: A
[2023-07-27T14:25:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: Phase shunt is between positive and phase
[2023-07-27T14:25:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Negative is between negative and phase
[2023-07-27T14:25:44] Mirono escooters: And what makes one so much better then the other
[2023-07-27T14:25:48] Mirono escooters: I fail to see
[2023-07-27T14:26:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: Phase shunt has more accurate measurements

[2023-07-27T14:35:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: What is the battery current that is rated for?
[2023-07-27T14:37:00] Lutz: 311A per Stage
[2023-07-27T14:37:34] Lutz: but u solder the battery cables three times, so like vesc 75/300
[2023-07-27T14:38:18] Lutz: i will post pictures how it looks ready asap
[2023-07-27T14:39:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: But how each stage will be cooled?
[2023-07-27T14:39:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: And why don‚Äôt use better mosfet?
[2023-07-27T14:39:37] Lutz: 120V
[2023-07-27T14:40:10] Lutz: i could make a few with Infineon
[2023-07-27T14:40:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: Oh right
[2023-07-27T14:40:47] Lutz: u need to attach the housing to sth that cools :))
[2023-07-27T14:41:41] Mirono escooters: That's going backwards
[2023-07-27T14:42:03] Lutz: <photos/photo_9042@27-07-2023_14-42-03.jpg>
[2023-07-27T14:42:04] Lutz: <photos/photo_9043@27-07-2023_14-42-04.jpg>
[2023-07-27T14:42:33] Lutz: u can go also with one stage
[2023-07-27T14:42:44] Lutz: easier to cool
[2023-07-27T14:42:46] Mirono escooters: Porn
[2023-07-27T14:44:08] Lutz: the holes are for 160v 15uf solid polymer additionally (optional) will test the effects

[2023-07-27T14:51:14] Mirono escooters: I'm designing my own outboards but I'd just get premade ones
[2023-07-27T14:52:03] Mirono escooters: Petersripol on YouTube Kept original but just added electric to existing gear systems So he can switch Incase emergency, or with solar panels and stuff Pretty cool
[2023-07-27T14:55:15] Jan: What pump do you run? What system to make it air bubble free?
[2023-07-27T14:56:05] Mirono escooters: Isn't that for the customer to do?
[2023-07-27T14:56:36] Mirono escooters: Depending on the need The 12W alieexpresss centrifugal pumps with sponge and reservoir are cool Or the submersible ones are even better
[2023-07-27T14:57:06] Mirono escooters: Centrifugal can suck water emself I use em in my autonomous boat to cool escs and fpv
[2023-07-27T14:57:21] Cologne: Hello Guys I have Stock g30 Batterie and + 6s Batterie ,what Must i Write in Cells ? Greets

[2023-07-27T16:35:50] sombre_enfant: Any tips to solder these
[2023-07-27T16:44:55] Oreo huzky: First remove old solder with solder wig make sure the holes are open then put capacitor in and hold soldering iron on bottom side against leg and solder pad and add solder
[2023-07-27T16:52:15] sombre_enfant: U clear the hole with what ? I have a hard time with pump
[2023-07-27T16:52:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: Solder pump
[2023-07-27T17:26:49] Oreo huzky: I had one but it broke so I just use some old copper wires to take off solder to lazy to get new one
[2023-07-27T17:28:05] Oreo huzky: If you use copper wire with thin strands and solder grease it works pretty decent
[2023-07-27T19:40:30] Happy Giraffe: Going to soak geared motor in this grease, hoping cooling gets way better
[2023-07-27T19:41:11] Happy Giraffe: Before max amps 40A batt 110A phase without overheating on city ride

[2023-07-27T22:08:13] Happy Giraffe: Last time I see it clean lol
[2023-07-27T22:12:28] Finn: Ferrofluid?
[2023-07-27T22:12:34] Finn: Stratorade
[2023-07-27T22:13:19] S1m 0n: Speed Signal
[2023-07-27T23:13:35] Cologne: Hey Guys what you have Set for g30 and the Electric Rear brake in Vesc ? Greets from Germany üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2023-07-27T23:35:18] Happy Giraffe: Grease
[2023-07-27T23:35:40] Happy Giraffe: Viscosity at 24¬∞c
[2023-07-27T23:49:42] Finn: üòã
[2023-07-27T23:51:05] Happy Giraffe: Hardest part is heating this up and pouring from a disc brake bolt. Otherwise cant fill itüòÅ Maybe I need a syringe if this wont work
[2023-07-28T00:19:52] Happy Giraffe: Not playing aroundüòÇ
[2023-07-28T01:01:22] Happy Giraffe: Bit harder to turn the wheel but maybe it settles in 10km riding
[2023-07-28T01:01:52] Happy Giraffe: Always can remove a bit grease if neededüòÅ This created a path for the heat if nothing else lol
[2023-07-28T01:15:33] Gabe Enzo: looks like too much to be idk
[2023-07-28T01:15:45] Gabe Enzo: u sure
[2023-07-28T01:21:57] Zak: Try less grease. Looks crazy amount
[2023-07-28T03:01:54] Happy Giraffe: Yeah it is, rolling resistance increased so much haha
[2023-07-28T03:02:14] Happy Giraffe: Might have to take some away tomorrow but I ride it like this first to see
[2023-07-28T03:03:02] Happy Giraffe: I wonder if resistance comes from spinning shells or the planetary gears
[2023-07-28T19:20:32] Happy Giraffe: Rode motor hot with fluid in and some leaked through the rotor boltsüòÇ
[2023-07-28T19:21:38] Happy Giraffe: So now I know it filled all the spaces inside and will remove 50% away
[2023-07-28T19:22:14] Happy Giraffe: Motor hot to touch so quickly so thermal transfer works
[2023-07-28T19:32:18] Happy Giraffe: 2x rolling resistance but that will settle when I take the extra grease offüòÇ
[2023-07-28T19:50:42] Mirono escooters: Sure?
[2023-07-28T19:51:25] Mirono escooters: And u sure the advantages outweigh disadvantages
[2023-07-28T19:51:33] Mirono escooters: Nylon is pretty forgiving non lube
[2023-07-28T19:53:49] Happy Giraffe: Yes when I remove excess grease. I might only leave 10% in there
[2023-07-28T20:33:08] Jedich Nixan: Does anyone use the Exa 291r for the Sharkset Suspension?
[2023-07-28T20:34:30] Happy Giraffe: And after 63¬∞c seemed hard to heat motor more on flat ground. If I solve rolling resistance then it might be awesome. Thermal sensor shouldn't be too much affected by grease?üòÅ
[2023-07-28T21:22:20] Happy Giraffe: New amount, it's just soaked in the gaps now so any excess will fly away inside to empty space
[2023-07-28T21:22:38] Mirono escooters: You Really having fun dissasembling that?
[2023-07-28T21:22:46] Mirono escooters: And I don't see why it can't ferrofluid?
[2023-07-28T21:22:47] Happy Giraffe: Windings completely covered and direct path to outer shell
[2023-07-28T21:23:29] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_9057@28-07-2023_21-23-29.jpg>
[2023-07-28T21:23:39] Happy Giraffe: White is ferrofluid max working area
[2023-07-28T21:23:57] Happy Giraffe: Grease will work between the two metal shells too
[2023-07-28T21:24:14] Happy Giraffe: And also let the sides heat up
[2023-07-28T21:24:41] Happy Giraffe: No, messy as hell
[2023-07-28T21:25:00] Happy Giraffe: Now brake rotor and axle in greaseüôà
[2023-07-28T22:32:35] Simone: wtf, who is this criminal ?
[2023-07-28T22:41:22] Mirono escooters: Criminal?
[2023-07-28T22:42:10] Simone: yes, the ferrofluid on the magnet
[2023-07-28T22:42:30] Simone: or is grease ?
[2023-07-28T22:42:32] Mirono escooters: I don't understand what's criminal
[2023-07-28T22:42:34] Mirono escooters: It's grease
[2023-07-28T22:42:48] Simone: is a criminal
[2023-07-28T22:43:09] Mirono escooters: Wtf
[2023-07-28T22:43:12] Simone: there is nothing to grease
[2023-07-28T22:43:36] Simone: the magnet don't touch the stator
[2023-07-28T22:43:52] Simone: the grease can burn
[2023-07-28T22:49:08] Simone: he have broke the motor, magnets must stay in the other place
[2023-07-28T22:56:09] Mirono escooters: What?
[2023-07-28T23:00:50] Happy Giraffe: 180¬∞c ratedüåö
[2023-07-28T23:01:10] Happy Giraffe: Lmao wtf are you talking aboutüòÇ
[2023-07-28T23:01:13] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-07-28T23:01:18] Mirono escooters: Hotter then your mom
[2023-07-28T23:01:44] Happy Giraffe: Lol, now cleaning disc and axle then testride nr.2
[2023-07-28T23:01:52] Ion: It's for cooling. To improve heat transfer from stator to Rotor
[2023-07-28T23:02:29] Ion: You can also fill with oil or something. Or use ferrofluid on rotor magnets
[2023-07-28T23:03:23] Happy Giraffe: Ferrofluid here has no effect as it has additional metal wall to pass heatüòÅ
[2023-07-28T23:03:51] Happy Giraffe: Grease now bridges everything
[2023-07-28T23:04:10] Mirono escooters: Just brake mega hard
[2023-07-28T23:04:11] Mirono escooters: Ez
[2023-07-28T23:06:49] Happy Giraffe: Even with grease leaking before due to pressure didn't lose brakes on rear. Grease thich enough at ambient temp so it stays in placeüòÅ
[2023-07-28T23:09:03] Simone: i will test
[2023-07-28T23:09:46] Happy Giraffe: What?üòÅ
[2023-07-28T23:09:56] Mirono escooters: Patat
[2023-07-28T23:10:41] Happy Giraffe: It's fun and games tuning motors but man I got my whole knee in that grease lol
[2023-07-28T23:10:57] Mirono escooters: Bleeding is also so fun
[2023-07-28T23:11:00] Mirono escooters: Don't shower beforehand
[2023-07-28T23:11:12] Mirono escooters: I pulled the syringe loose while under pressure
[2023-07-28T23:11:23] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-07-28T23:11:53] Happy Giraffe: Lol, grin motor insane quality. Everything just snaps in placeüòÅ Unlike Xiaomi or MonoshitüòÇ
[2023-07-28T23:12:31] Mirono escooters: Price difference heh
[2023-07-28T23:12:40] Mirono escooters: Never use monoshit as a comparison
[2023-07-28T23:12:43] Mirono escooters: It's not worthy
[2023-07-28T23:15:21] Happy Giraffe: Looked at the cnc quality its so precise and perfect
[2023-07-29T00:40:24] JPPL: <video_file>
[2023-07-29T00:43:59] Mirono escooters: Humans..
[2023-07-29T00:44:08] Mirono escooters: That's why I got a 120db horn
[2023-07-29T00:44:10] Mirono escooters: Very fun
[2023-07-29T01:35:06] Happy Giraffe: "thug life"
[2023-07-29T01:36:33] Happy Giraffe: Testing succesful, did some nice field weakening and 3000w rides and motor topped 70¬∞c. It cools down about twice as fast and when riding it doesnt get more than 55¬∞c on flat as it cools it enough at that point not to go further
[2023-07-29T01:36:53] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_9058@29-07-2023_01-36-53.jpg>
[2023-07-29T01:43:58] Ion: That's a geared motor right? What are the advantages compared to regular hub motors (for ebikes)?
[2023-07-29T01:49:49] Happy Giraffe: Its lighter, often smaller, more torque per amp typically
[2023-07-29T01:50:21] Mirono escooters: But it's boring
[2023-07-29T01:50:26] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-07-29T01:50:36] Happy Giraffe: This one is special as it comes with included proper torque arm and doesnt have locked clutch so it can do powerful regen brakingüòÅ
[2023-07-29T01:50:49] Happy Giraffe: NaahüòÇ
[2023-07-29T01:51:00] Mirono escooters: It doesn't like high power That's all I have to know
[2023-07-29T01:51:24] Happy Giraffe: Difference between your ebike and mine is I can ride in front of 4 cops and no one bats an eye as they let me go on crosswalküòÇ
[2023-07-29T01:51:47] Ion: Didn't know that there were some that had that feature. Cool
[2023-07-29T01:51:54] Mirono escooters: Fuck off ü•≤üò≠
[2023-07-29T01:51:58] Happy Giraffe: Some guy filled it with transmission fluid and ran 180A phaseüòÇ thats 200Nm+
[2023-07-29T01:52:15] Mirono escooters: Bwah anything under 300 I'm not interested
[2023-07-29T01:52:22] Mirono escooters: I have 7awg, you?
[2023-07-29T01:52:45] Happy Giraffe: Tho nowadays Grin has direct drive all-axle hub motor that I might consider if I were to buy motor again
[2023-07-29T01:52:52] Happy Giraffe: 10üòÅ
[2023-07-29T01:53:01] Mirono escooters: Drops mic
[2023-07-29T01:53:48] Happy Giraffe: Lol, its a nice commuter bike as it was purposed toüåö
[2023-07-29T01:54:09] Happy Giraffe: That accelerates to 60kmh like a mad bull when neededüòÅ

[2023-07-29T02:07:42] Happy Giraffe: For DD hub compared to geared they say +25% continuous power and with statorade +80%
[2023-07-29T02:35:43] Cass: Me
[2023-07-29T03:24:40] Happy Giraffe: Compared to Gmac motorüòÅ
[2023-07-29T03:24:51] Happy Giraffe: Im comparing different motors there
[2023-07-29T03:28:12] Happy Giraffe: Grin does these numbers for their all axle rear dd motor
[2023-07-29T03:28:27] Happy Giraffe: 27mm magnet lol
[2023-07-29T09:14:50] Jedich Nixan: Which one exactly?

[2023-07-29T09:21:39] Jedich Nixan: Ok? Thought 125mm is for Sharkset ü§î
[2023-07-29T09:22:35] Cass: original one is 125, but i like the deck higher so bought 150mm one
[2023-07-29T09:23:43] Jedich Nixan: Any link you bought it?

[2023-07-29T09:28:03] Cass: Tell the shop to send 150lbs ones instead 250 lbs or buy seperatly the 150lbs springs
[2023-07-29T11:31:03] Cologne: Hello everyone. I wanted to ask you if she is familiar with the settings and could help me with that. I can send you a few photos. And maybe there are and what improvements are there.

[2023-07-29T11:37:00] Cologne: Does it give what Must i Change or something üôà G30,10s+6s ,and 32 Magnets 470w Engine
[2023-07-29T11:38:27] Oreo huzky: Have you turned phase filters off it‚Äôs not available for 75100 and can cause damage if left turned on
[2023-07-29T12:53:21] Cologne: Oh üòß
[2023-07-29T14:00:13] Oreo huzky: Do that before using it
[2023-07-29T14:01:11] Oreo huzky: And I would also change the throttle curve but that‚Äôs just personal preference because I like it when the curve is a bit faster
[2023-07-29T14:06:04] Jedich Nixan: <photos/photo_9067@29-07-2023_14-06-04.jpg>

[2023-07-29T14:57:10] Mirono escooters: That's air?
[2023-07-29T14:57:31] Mirono escooters: Dnm ok But u need more weight/pressure for air to work smooth
[2023-07-29T15:00:48] Oreo huzky: Can‚Äôt you just lubricate the insides of it?

[2023-07-29T15:03:08] Jedich Nixan: Question is what is better..Air or Oil System. I'd guess Oil would be better for more Comfortable
[2023-07-29T15:05:56] Oreo huzky: On pc go to app settings in vesc software and go to adc and change throttle curve
[2023-07-29T15:07:15] Oreo huzky: You can see the changes to the curve directly in the vesc software
[2023-07-29T15:08:33] Mirono escooters: No, air needs min 120psi+-
[2023-07-29T15:09:02] Mirono escooters: Oil if no lever
[2023-07-29T15:10:18] Jedich Nixan: Lever?
[2023-07-29T15:10:41] Mirono escooters: C type suspension
[2023-07-29T15:10:43] Mirono escooters: Lever effect
[2023-07-29T15:10:49] Mirono escooters: Like dereza
[2023-07-29T15:14:29] Happy Giraffe: Im changing to air suspension aswell, Rockshox will be much better than current oil OEM shitüòÇ Works half of the time
[2023-07-29T15:14:56] Happy Giraffe: Need to buy shock pump for that
[2023-07-29T15:20:40] Mirono escooters: Ya on bike it's lever
[2023-07-29T15:21:04] Mirono escooters: Exa on monoshit did NOTHING 40psi otherwise rock hard And always had to jump on it so it would become loose Yes, lubed, yes
[2023-07-29T15:35:58] Happy Giraffe: I mean front
[2023-07-29T15:37:09] Mirono escooters: Ah you mean fork suspension
[2023-07-29T15:37:09] Mirono escooters: Yah expensive ones work ok, bomber one was so smooth.
[2023-07-29T15:48:51] Happy Giraffe: Dnm is nice for street riding
[2023-07-29T15:49:15] Happy Giraffe: I go cheapest Rockshox Silver Judy etc

[2023-07-29T16:11:36] Mirono escooters: I bring to you: electromagnetic suspension
[2023-07-29T16:12:00] Mirono escooters: I'm debating to try and make (electro/magnetic suspension for engineering class, but idk what I'll end up with..
[2023-07-29T16:12:06] Mirono escooters: It's that or a wankel engine
[2023-07-29T16:24:24] Ion: Imagine Electromagnetic suspension on scooter... Idk if possible
[2023-07-29T16:25:19] Mirono escooters: Everything possible
[2023-07-29T16:25:25] Mirono escooters: But do you want the extra weight?
[2023-07-29T16:25:38] Mirono escooters: The reason it never got used is weight mostly
[2023-07-29T16:25:39] Mirono escooters: And price
[2023-07-29T16:36:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: And consider the power waste üòÇ
[2023-07-29T16:36:59] Mirono escooters: But it's fun
[2023-07-29T17:28:33] Awyba: which size did you have?
[2023-07-29T17:29:05] Mirono escooters: Exa something
[2023-07-29T17:29:07] Mirono escooters: 165mm
[2023-07-29T17:29:34] Awyba: weird im not having any problems
[2023-07-29T17:29:51] Awyba: but yes low pressure
[2023-07-29T17:46:34] Ion: It would be fun. Imagine floating over bumps and bad roads
[2023-07-29T17:46:57] Mirono escooters: Ya that or hydraulic suspension
[2023-07-29T17:47:17] Mirono escooters: The old citroens had it, super smooth But expensive and maintenance was horrible. It failed and then you'd have 0 suspension and a 10k bill
[2023-07-29T17:47:29] Mirono escooters: Maybe I'll do it as a engineering projects
[2023-07-29T18:19:29] Ion: Yeah the DS (?) Could drive on 3 wheels with self leveling suspension.
[2023-07-29T18:20:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Was it the one with a double valve or single valve?
[2023-07-29T18:21:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: double valve shit on my g30 single valve always good
[2023-07-29T18:49:08] Mirono escooters: Singol
[2023-07-29T18:49:08] Mirono escooters: Ya that was so cool to see
[2023-07-29T18:49:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: :(
[2023-07-29T18:59:43] Mirono escooters: Heh
[2023-07-29T18:59:49] Mirono escooters: Oil is better for 50kg
[2023-07-29T20:13:45] Happy Giraffe: Exa meant to be used in bike rear shock I think so the pressure values will be off
[2023-07-29T20:21:17] Mirono escooters: No..
[2023-07-29T20:21:27] Mirono escooters: It's mi√± recommended pressure
[2023-07-29T20:21:34] Mirono escooters: Doesn't matter where it's used
[2023-07-29T20:25:56] Happy Giraffe: Yeah but you get my point, product not designed for usüòÅ
[2023-07-29T20:26:12] Mirono escooters: Blabla
[2023-07-29T20:26:17] Mirono escooters: For 50kg üòß
[2023-07-29T20:26:27] Happy Giraffe: Eat more porridge
[2023-07-29T22:09:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Hey. I was asked by someone to make a script that limits the speed of the scooter to 20km/h when pressing the brake 5 times. So I made it and thought some here might like to use it as well:
[2023-07-29T22:10:00] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <video_file>

[2023-07-29T22:10:28] Mirono escooters: How much time is there to press brake
[2023-07-29T22:10:42] Mirono escooters: I've got a 433mhz controller, wich I still think is the safest option
[2023-07-29T22:10:50] Mirono escooters: It's for my porch and the police cannot touch it
[2023-07-29T22:10:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Every time you press the time resets, when you do not press for 5 seconds it goes back to zero

[2023-07-30T11:47:06] Mirono escooters: Depends on your motor kV..
[2023-07-30T11:47:14] Mirono escooters: And battery voltage
[2023-07-30T11:49:27] Finn: With 16s and 800w mini blade sure

[2023-07-30T13:06:47] Mirono escooters: He didn't give me that info so I went with the average

[2023-07-30T13:09:23] Mirono escooters: Well then more speed and power for you
[2023-07-30T13:09:56] Unknown: But the man who does everything for me doesn't work with firmware above 5.2
[2023-07-30T13:10:19] Unknown: He claims above its not stable

[2023-07-30T13:36:24] Mirono escooters: Why he says that
[2023-07-30T13:41:26] Unknown: I decided to install myself ware do I find guide ?
[2023-07-30T13:59:32] Face de Pin Suc√©: Hahaha those people that believes about 5.2 because first 5.3 had some troubles and don't want to update, I know a few in esk8 Usually they are the same type that doesn't understand the difference between motor current and battery current
[2023-07-30T14:34:57] Cologne: Hey ,how Woud u Change the Throttle Curve ?
[2023-07-30T15:15:01] Oreo huzky: I think it was make the throttle expo higher so that the curve is steeper at the beginning (left side)
[2023-07-30T15:32:17] Ion: I think that's the wrong curve. You need ADC for scooter. You can change the function (natural, expo, linear) and change the shape by changing a value. It's explained in the tips. I only did it on the mobile app under app - ADC - throttle curve (if I remember correctly)
[2023-07-30T15:45:19] Oreo huzky: In pc go to app and then into general
[2023-07-30T15:58:46] Cologne: Ok thx Guys ,pls can u Show me how ü•∫

[2023-07-30T18:20:15] Mirko Boni: Good morning everyone, I have to disassemble a battery that has cells glued with sicaflex, can anyone help me? What is the procedure to avoid damaging the cells?
[2023-07-30T18:21:04] Mirono escooters: Oh no, that seems impossible
[2023-07-30T18:21:08] Mirono escooters: Sell it and build new
[2023-07-30T18:21:12] Mirono escooters: Or remove wrap and rewrap them
[2023-07-30T18:21:16] Mirono escooters: (super time consuming.)
[2023-07-30T18:21:34] Mirko Boni: üò±
[2023-07-30T18:21:45] Mirko Boni: but it is terrible.
[2023-07-30T18:21:52] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-07-30T18:21:55] Mirono escooters: I wouldn't do it
[2023-07-30T18:22:59] Mirko Boni: with @jamessoderstrom we discovered that the arrays have no insulation material and all the cells are just glued together
[2023-07-30T18:23:49] Mirono escooters: üò≠
[2023-07-30T18:23:54] Mirono escooters: Trash it
[2023-07-30T18:23:59] Mirono escooters: Who's batt is it
[2023-07-30T18:24:23] Happy Giraffe: White arrow changes the throttle curve type, green one being positive value slightly finetunes the curve
[2023-07-30T18:24:41] Mirko Boni: was made in italy
[2023-07-30T18:24:57] Happy Giraffe: You gotta press "‚àÜA" to save the settings
[2023-07-30T18:25:29] Happy Giraffe: Explained here
[2023-07-30T18:26:03] Happy Giraffe: Best to have as straight of a curve as possible and 0%
[2023-07-30T18:27:08] Mirono escooters: Bweh, by who
[2023-07-30T18:27:45] Happy Giraffe: On white arrow put 180A
[2023-07-30T18:28:13] Happy Giraffe: Green arrow 40A
[2023-07-30T18:30:48] Cologne: Thx a lot
[2023-07-30T18:31:40] Cologne: Really 180 i can take ? Thx üòòüòòüòò
[2023-07-30T18:38:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: If it was made by my friend, he normally use double heat shrink on cell, and is more than enough for insulation . Are 4 layer total of pvc separates cells between them
[2023-07-30T18:39:44] Mirko Boni: thank you paolo. i'll call him tomorrow.
[2023-07-30T18:40:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: You can see if you opened it, I‚Äôm not sure if he did. But I always recommended him to do
[2023-07-30T18:40:44] Mirono escooters: Bweh so much work
[2023-07-30T18:40:51] Mirono escooters: Wrapping each cell again
[2023-07-30T18:40:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: Send it
[2023-07-30T18:42:59] Mirono escooters: Oof
[2023-07-30T18:43:07] Mirono escooters: If that friend builded it, nice friend xD
[2023-07-30T18:43:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes I know, but the cell looks more sexy and safeüòÅ if battery isn‚Äôt too big I prefer this way
[2023-07-30T18:43:11] Mirko Boni: i don't want to speak ill of enrico. he is my friend and i want to talk to him
[2023-07-30T18:45:43] Mirono escooters: Ya but for business building makes 0 sense.. 2 layers kapton.. :)
[2023-07-30T18:46:00] Mirono escooters: I hope if it's the case he will compensate
[2023-07-30T18:47:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: Kapton is very subtle, you need to put strong material better for this
[2023-07-30T18:48:42] Mirono escooters: Ja kapton glue fishpaper glue fibreglass
[2023-07-30T18:48:45] Mirono escooters: If big pack I do this
[2023-07-30T18:48:53] Mirono escooters: Fibreglass tape is very strong for it
[2023-07-30T18:49:01] Mirono escooters: XD ja
[2023-07-30T18:49:03] Mirono escooters: It's so smooth
[2023-07-30T18:49:08] Mirono escooters: Can even be used low friction paper
[2023-07-30T18:49:25] Happy Giraffe: Its just an error limit, doesnt affect power

[2023-07-30T23:07:12] Happy Giraffe: Just bolt a disc caliper holder to the monorim fork side with 2-3 bigger bolts like M6
[2023-07-30T23:07:40] Happy Giraffe: Take inspiration from monorim disc caliper holder and do it better than them

[2023-07-30T23:52:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: Huayi fet is really powerful but very slow too in switching, so I think if the driving circuit isn‚Äôt well done , the controller gone with that much fets. Do you have maybe the picture of mosfet driver chip?

[2023-07-31T00:24:04] Mirono escooters: Europa will be hard
[2023-07-31T00:26:37] Oreo huzky: Be paying 300‚Ç¨ for that in Germany
[2023-07-31T00:26:57] Oreo huzky: Buy on Ali and just wait the few weeks
[2023-07-31T00:28:39] Happy Giraffe: At that point would just buy Grin SatiatorüòÇ
[2023-07-31T00:29:01] Happy Giraffe: But it doesnt have 10A in high voltage, max 5A I think
[2023-07-31T00:29:32] Mirono escooters: 10 day delivery brt
[2023-07-31T00:30:01] Oreo huzky: Buy 4 diodes and big resistor to make 84V
[2023-07-31T00:31:59] Oreo huzky: And just plug that in socket
[2023-07-31T00:32:44] Oreo huzky: Actually don‚Äôt do that might not be so safe

[2023-07-31T01:07:46] Mirono escooters: You simply cannot go bad w icogogo
[2023-07-31T01:10:45] Gordan Gizdic: Idk. When you see the output cables for 20+A constant charging, it kinda makes you wonder.
[2023-07-31T01:11:07] Gordan Gizdic: Id rather make my own cable. I guess ill order the last one i sent.
[2023-07-31T01:11:23] Gordan Gizdic: At least its big, beefy and looks cool.
[2023-07-31T01:11:34] Mirono escooters: I fail to see the issue? Xt60 handles that
[2023-07-31T01:12:03] Gordan Gizdic: I can put xt60 on anything. Doesnt make it safe.
[2023-07-31T01:12:25] Gordan Gizdic: What makes it safe is good electronics, quality components.
[2023-07-31T01:12:35] Gordan Gizdic: Insides is what counts.
[2023-07-31T01:12:55] Gordan Gizdic: Seen too many of them where thermal protection is not mounted properly.
[2023-07-31T01:13:00] Mirono escooters: But you were talking about wires?..
[2023-07-31T01:13:15] Mirono escooters: Icogogo is always good for me, always top of line components and quality
[2023-07-31T01:13:35] Gordan Gizdic: Yeah, 20+A of constant requires at least 4mm2 cable and not 0.75mm2 cable.
[2023-07-31T01:13:56] Gordan Gizdic: Ill order the big one.
[2023-07-31T01:14:06] Mirono escooters: Where did you see 0.75mm2
[2023-07-31T01:14:40] Gordan Gizdic: Onmore than a couple of these chinese chargers

[2023-08-01T09:46:19] Nick: I am building an electric motorcycle with the following parts any input or advice would be appreciated since I've only ever put a vesc into a meepo skateboard before
[2023-08-01T09:46:25] Nick: <photos/photo_9091@01-08-2023_09-46-25.jpg>

[2023-08-01T09:46:49] Gabe Enzo: 2 awg, 10awg.
[2023-08-01T09:46:56] Gabe Enzo: Typical cable tho
[2023-08-01T09:47:11] Gabe Enzo: I was close.
[2023-08-01T11:06:22] Nick: <photos/photo_9093@01-08-2023_11-06-22.jpg>
[2023-08-01T11:06:47] Nick: Hey if this can so 70kmh with a stock controller that'd mean it probably peaks at 3kw right?
[2023-08-01T11:06:57] Finn: Are these Lead Acid batteries?üôà
[2023-08-01T11:07:07] Nick: They're the old ones don't worry
[2023-08-01T11:07:13] Nick: They're being ripped out and discarded
[2023-08-01T11:07:24] Finn: You have so much space
[2023-08-01T11:07:32] Nick: Replacing with 35ah 84 lithium
[2023-08-01T11:08:15] Finn: 20s
[2023-08-01T11:08:18] Finn: Or 22s
[2023-08-01T11:10:49] Nick: That I'm not sure. It's being built for me. Was originally a battery for a vs3tt 10 at 60v and the scooter was stolen so he's stepping it up to 84v
[2023-08-01T11:10:55] Nick: But keeping it 35ah

[2023-08-01T11:16:48] Mirono escooters: Just get a Xiaomi air pump..
[2023-08-01T11:17:14] Mirono escooters: More like continuous
[2023-08-01T11:22:07] Nick: Interesting. So if it's continously 3kw would that mean peak is higehr
[2023-08-01T11:22:15] Nick: Sorry if it sounds stupid I'm learning as I go
[2023-08-01T11:22:53] Mirono escooters: That's very likely Wich Esc it got?
[2023-08-01T11:23:02] Nick: <photos/photo_9091@01-08-2023_09-46-25.jpg>
[2023-08-01T11:23:11] Nick: This will be the stuff
[2023-08-01T12:33:55] Happy Giraffe: It being powered by main battery is much more reliable and less weight to carryüòÅ
[2023-08-01T12:59:05] Zak: Cant put that voltage through 85v controller
[2023-08-01T12:59:44] Mirono escooters: Bwuh 10‚Ç¨ for a wire you can resolder in 5mins
[2023-08-01T13:00:34] Nick: So the 85v controller will not work?
[2023-08-01T13:00:58] Nick: I selected 2 on accident
[2023-08-01T13:01:06] Nick: For the hall sensor wire
[2023-08-01T13:10:14] Nick: I intend at least for now to run the motor at whatever the ESC is happy with putting into it. Will probably do a heatsink on it too. So hoping just 84v or whatever it wants. Motor is for a 72v so I figured id be above whatever the draw actually is but idk much about this stuff the project is half educational
[2023-08-01T13:19:17] Nick: No its a 84v battery
[2023-08-01T13:19:28] Nick: Nominal
[2023-08-01T13:19:56] Nick: But I'm only gonna make it output what the motor can actually put on the ground without burning itself
[2023-08-01T13:21:07] Nick: Does 70kmh with the stock 72v controller and lead acid so I'm assuming g with some more juice it'll have better range and some more torque. It was already pretty quick before any of this started getting planned
[2023-08-01T13:21:23] Nick: That was before the crap batteries died at least
[2023-08-01T13:22:16] Nick: I only really need a max of 100kmh but obviously more is merrier so I feel like it's already in the ballpark
[2023-08-01T13:24:26] Nick: Starting out at least
[2023-08-01T13:25:26] Gabe Enzo: No
[2023-08-01T13:25:34] Gabe Enzo: voltage drops to nominal during load
[2023-08-01T13:25:42] Gabe Enzo: Yea
[2023-08-01T13:25:54] Gabe Enzo: Yes it will work
[2023-08-01T13:26:35] Nick: So I should run it so it's 72v even if thr battery is made for 84v? Should I instead get a controller for 72v or is overkill kind of how these work
[2023-08-01T13:26:50] Nick: Like underpromise over deliver on electricity?
[2023-08-01T13:26:57] Gabe Enzo: Stay with the 85v for tolerance reasons
[2023-08-01T13:27:19] Nick: Ohhh okay I see. I have no issue doing that and I'll probably get some damn good range
[2023-08-01T13:27:48] Nick: That being said this monster is 200lb so I have to strip some parts down still
[2023-08-01T13:27:56] Nick: <photos/photo_9097@01-08-2023_13-27-56.jpg>
[2023-08-01T13:28:02] Nick: Gonna make it look like this
[2023-08-01T13:28:11] Gabe Enzo: I love electric motorbikes.
[2023-08-01T13:28:26] Nick: <photos/photo_9098@01-08-2023_13-28-26.jpg>
[2023-08-01T13:28:31] Nick: This is it stock
[2023-08-01T13:28:35] Gabe Enzo: How many HP are you planning
[2023-08-01T13:28:54] Nick: Fenders are dorky and coming off, I'd the hp but maybe like a 250cc equivalent?
[2023-08-01T13:29:02] Gabe Enzo: 25hp ya?
[2023-08-01T13:29:08] Gabe Enzo: I think you don't need to gut much of the frame then
[2023-08-01T13:29:12] Nick: Oh I don't know math but yea
[2023-08-01T13:29:22] Gabe Enzo: 100cc is 10hp
[2023-08-01T13:29:28] Nick: Basically I want it faster than a ninja 250 which is what I used to ride
[2023-08-01T13:29:53] Gabe Enzo: for dirtbikes
[2023-08-01T13:29:57] Nick: I obviously won't be taking it on the freeway so actual long range high speed isn't necessary
[2023-08-01T13:30:17] Gabe Enzo: You could, the issue is getting pulled over üòÇ
[2023-08-01T13:30:23] Nick: I also want to have a "police mode" where I can toggle it to only go 40kmh
[2023-08-01T13:30:28] Nick: So if they test it it's legal
[2023-08-01T13:30:32] Mirono escooters: You going to use chain?
[2023-08-01T13:30:34] Mirono escooters: It'll be loud
[2023-08-01T13:30:48] Gabe Enzo: I have a police mode on my pro 2, changes to 25kmh max
[2023-08-01T13:30:51] Gabe Enzo: he has a hub
[2023-08-01T13:30:55] Mirono escooters: Ok good
[2023-08-01T13:31:02] Nick: I'm keeping the chain on it for looks but it doesn't actually do anything. It's for backup pedals because it's originally an LSM
[2023-08-01T13:31:18] Gabe Enzo: turn on police mode when on freeway yeah üóø
[2023-08-01T13:31:32] Nick: Lmao "it's a ebike I swear"
[2023-08-01T13:31:39] Nick: Frantically reinstalling the pedals
[2023-08-01T13:36:05] Nick: <photos/photo_9099@01-08-2023_13-36-05.jpg>
[2023-08-01T13:37:08] Nick: So when we first talked it was to go from 60v for a vsett to 72v for the motor but once we found out some more and I sent him the pics we decided on 84v
[2023-08-01T13:38:41] Nick: So I'm not sure. It used to be this one but after my vsett was stolen he was going to add 14 cells to go to 72v but then we decided on 84
[2023-08-01T13:38:59] Nick: And idk anything about batteries other than it makes my wheels go fast
[2023-08-01T13:40:15] Nick: So from 16s7p to whatever would make it 84v but idk much about these things
[2023-08-01T13:40:53] Nick: https://skyartpower.com/products/vsett-10-35ah-battery-16s7p
[2023-08-01T13:40:58] Nick: The original build
[2023-08-01T13:48:22] Gabe Enzo: "motors usually don't care what voltage you run them at" ding ding ding
[2023-08-01T13:48:43] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-08-01T13:49:41] Nick: I'm saying voltage but I guess I'm more worried about putting more power into it than it can handle but idk if they just explode or what if that actually happens. Last vesc I ever did was on a meepo v3
[2023-08-01T13:50:07] Gabe Enzo: They stop working cause the windings melt
[2023-08-01T13:50:10] Gabe Enzo: just monitor temps
[2023-08-01T13:50:19] Gabe Enzo: then you can tweak VESC to not melt it
[2023-08-01T13:50:49] Gabe Enzo: not worth the time to rewind it so usually they're just thrown in the trash and forgotten about
[2023-08-01T13:51:04] Mirono escooters: Worst is they just stop working, it won't explode
[2023-08-01T13:51:27] Mirono escooters: Usually hubs handle quite a bit more power Ferrofluid it and temperature sensor That's all u need
[2023-08-01T13:52:42] Nick: She gonna be drippin witg ferrofluid when I'm done
[2023-08-01T14:59:48] Unknown: she arrives shortly for my kaabo Mantis
[2023-08-01T16:50:22] Nick: I have a series of maybe stupid questions
[2023-08-01T16:50:44] Nick: Trying to disconnect this series of lead acids. It's just like a car right? Black out first?

[2023-08-01T16:51:54] Nick: Just don't wanna get zapped even if they're dead I don't trust them
[2023-08-01T16:52:02] Mirono escooters: Ya
[2023-08-01T16:52:14] Mirono escooters: But it doesn't matter It's series, disconnect one disconnect whole corcuit

[2023-08-01T16:52:25] Mirono escooters: Scooters aren't grounded like cars
[2023-08-01T16:52:29] Mirono escooters: Bwuh
[2023-08-01T16:52:52] Nick: Kidding I have real gloves

[2023-08-01T16:53:45] Mirono escooters: Have fun
[2023-08-01T16:55:26] Nick: Okay series is taken out. I have had bad experiences with car batteries zapping me lol
[2023-08-01T17:03:27] Nick: I think I lost 80lb just taking those out... so heavy
[2023-08-01T17:11:33] Nick: Okay gross yucky is out and vesc will be on order soon
[2023-08-01T17:11:57] Nick: <photos/photo_9104@01-08-2023_17-11-57.jpg>
[2023-08-01T17:12:31] Nick: Anyone know what this thing is?

[2023-08-01T17:13:08] Mirono escooters: A breaker?..
[2023-08-01T17:13:22] Mirono escooters: Or well, resetable fuse Depends how you look at it
[2023-08-01T17:13:55] Nick: Will this interfere with the vesc at all? It's on the positive line for the battery
[2023-08-01T17:14:18] Mirono escooters: Remove
[2023-08-01T17:14:22] Mirono escooters: 1200W
[2023-08-01T17:14:43] Nick: Yeah ew
[2023-08-01T17:14:47] Nick: Removing for sure
[2023-08-01T17:30:52] AK: I did a test drive with the citroen ami today
[2023-08-01T17:31:09] AK: I need it right now
[2023-08-01T17:32:01] AK: It speaks to me, best shitbox for the new 100kw vescs
[2023-08-01T17:33:11] Mirono escooters: Internet obsessed w it xd
[2023-08-01T17:33:28] Mirono escooters: Do be expensive shitbox
[2023-08-01T17:35:42] AK: <video_file>
[2023-08-01T17:36:36] AK: Actually I thought about it, it's quite reasonable tbh, iohawk vsett 10 is like 2.3keur, the ami has 5.5kwh, doors, and a rollcage and real suspension, for 8k its fairly reasonable
[2023-08-01T17:40:24] Mirono escooters: 2.3k for a iohawk is way to overpriced
[2023-08-01T17:40:30] Mirono escooters: Comparing apples to pears
[2023-08-01T17:40:39] Mirono escooters: But yeah, 8k is reasonable
[2023-08-01T17:40:57] Mirono escooters: But considering you have a real car secondhand for 10k.. I know what I'd take..
[2023-08-01T17:41:09] Mirono escooters: It's fun, but not useful daily
[2023-08-01T17:41:30] Mirono escooters: My opinion tho
[2023-08-01T17:41:34] Mirono escooters: I haven't even rode one so
[2023-08-01T17:41:35] AK: Vsett 10 costs the same
[2023-08-01T17:41:43] Mirono escooters: Still overpriced garbage
[2023-08-01T17:41:47] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-08-01T17:42:09] AK: Well this is where we differ, there are no cars tbh right now which I would want to own
[2023-08-01T17:42:28] Mirono escooters: Piaggio ape?
[2023-08-01T17:42:32] Mirono escooters: ‡∂û
[2023-08-01T17:42:53] Mirono escooters: I'm still a motorbike guy and very distant from the car centered world we live in, so maybe that's where we match?
[2023-08-01T17:43:32] Mirono escooters: I don't have 8k to spend so I don't even consider a car üòÅ

[2023-08-01T17:51:21] Nick: Rate my first solder in 4 yrs
[2023-08-01T17:51:33] Nick: <photos/photo_9108@01-08-2023_17-51-33.jpg>
[2023-08-01T17:51:33] Finn: Lets see
[2023-08-01T17:51:56] Finn: You soldered on a wire or did you connect them
[2023-08-01T17:52:01] Nick: <photos/photo_9109@01-08-2023_17-52-01.jpg>
[2023-08-01T17:52:09] Nick: Connected two
[2023-08-01T17:52:18] Nick: I interlocked them and then soldered that way
[2023-08-01T17:52:25] Mirono escooters: More flux, heat
[2023-08-01T17:52:30] Mirono escooters: Make it flow better
[2023-08-01T17:52:46] Finn: Tin the wires first and then solder them together
[2023-08-01T17:53:12] Mirono escooters: Not needed
[2023-08-01T17:53:15] Mirono escooters: Interlocked works
[2023-08-01T17:53:42] Finn: Better is to do it like this
[2023-08-01T17:53:56] Finn: Trust me learned it like ipc normes
[2023-08-01T17:54:17] Mirono escooters: Yah yah if u jank enough good flowing solder on its perfectly fine
[2023-08-01T17:54:23] Mirono escooters: Then you aren't trusting solder to lock em
[2023-08-01T17:54:51] Happy Giraffe: Das Auto

[2023-08-01T17:56:29] Nick: Yall basically guiding me thru building a motorcycle rn
[2023-08-01T17:56:39] Finn: Looks better
[2023-08-01T17:56:39] Mirono escooters: 10‚Ç¨/h
[2023-08-01T17:56:50] Finn: 0‚Ç¨/h
[2023-08-01T17:56:56] Mirono escooters: Yah still a bit dry joint and not good flow but your soldering iron is problably not powerful enough
[2023-08-01T17:56:59] Mirono escooters: Or your solder is shit
[2023-08-01T17:57:03] Oreo huzky: -10/h
[2023-08-01T17:57:05] Mirono escooters: Buy some lead solder with flux core
[2023-08-01T17:57:07] Mirono escooters: It helps a lot
[2023-08-01T17:57:48] Happy Giraffe: And you also need heat shrink on top, electrical tape leaves a mess and can come off leaving wire unprotected
[2023-08-01T17:57:58] Gabe Enzo: Just don't let the terminals touch üóø
[2023-08-01T17:58:05] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-08-01T17:58:07] Mirono escooters: Do it for fun
[2023-08-01T17:58:15] Gabe Enzo: big sparks
[2023-08-01T17:58:30] Gabe Enzo: it leaves disgusting goo
[2023-08-01T17:59:50] Nick: It's lumpy looking but very solid
[2023-08-01T18:00:12] Mirono escooters: Good nough
[2023-08-01T18:00:13] Mirono escooters: Flux time

[2023-08-01T18:00:30] Nick: So hard to get a good pic
[2023-08-01T18:00:37] Nick: Is it easy to tell I have shaky hands lmao
[2023-08-01T18:00:57] Happy Giraffe: 400¬∞c iron, clean tip with the copper ball sponge, then do a thin coat of solder to tip of iron to transfer heat from tip tip top object. You wanna heat the wires with as much contact area as possible so heat transfer is more effective. Also you see if it is properly soldered if you heat wire from bottom and solder can be applied in the top and you see it melting inside.
[2023-08-01T18:01:35] Nick: Okay I was definitely doing it wrong I was using just the very tip
[2023-08-01T18:02:00] Happy Giraffe: Lastly only use solder that has flux inside. Others are junk and meant for trashcan. Solder containing lead is very good but illegal these days.
[2023-08-01T18:02:01] Nick: I'm learning more here than I ever did in school I should have built this monstrosity years ago
[2023-08-01T18:02:21] Nick: <photos/photo_9112@01-08-2023_18-02-21.jpg>
[2023-08-01T18:03:00] Mirono escooters: Most here are self taught
[2023-08-01T18:03:13] Mirono escooters: I study engineering but it's vague and basic..
[2023-08-01T18:03:23] Mirono escooters: Even soldering is hard for em üíÄ
[2023-08-01T18:03:31] Mirono escooters: Ok good
[2023-08-01T18:03:44] Mirono escooters: Oh no, always lay it flat as possible
[2023-08-01T18:03:54] Mirono escooters: Transfer as much heat In a Short amount of time
[2023-08-01T18:07:09] Nick: <photos/photo_9113@01-08-2023_18-07-09.jpg>
[2023-08-01T18:07:29] Nick: Used heat gun to melt it a little to get it tight
[2023-08-01T18:07:40] Happy Giraffe: First time of me being in metal school today, was a nice place. All students are already employed so didnt see them much. 5-axis mill was free (for a custom battery case later?üòÇ)
[2023-08-01T18:09:18] Happy Giraffe: Should work if connection is good. If not, then it will heat up there and burn the wire so you gotta check on that after first used if you see any discoloration
[2023-08-01T18:09:39] Mirono escooters: Use it
[2023-08-01T18:09:44] Mirono escooters: 5 axis mill.. I need
[2023-08-01T18:09:58] Mirono escooters: University had a metal printer, a big chonk. I have a photo somewhere
[2023-08-01T18:09:58] Happy Giraffe: What soldeing iron you have? How many watts?
[2023-08-01T18:10:10] Nick: Amazon one it does 450 allegedly
[2023-08-01T18:10:19] Nick: Feels like it's hot enough my technique is just ass rn
[2023-08-01T18:10:45] Happy Giraffe: Wattage for these kind of wires 40w absolute minumum
[2023-08-01T18:11:11] Nick: I'm realizing I should have done this outside
[2023-08-01T18:11:29] Nick: <photos/photo_9114@01-08-2023_18-11-29.jpg>

[2023-08-01T18:12:02] Happy Giraffe: This is absolutely normalüòÅ
[2023-08-01T18:12:56] Nick: This is my living room
[2023-08-01T18:13:01] Nick: Or it used to be
[2023-08-01T18:13:14] Nick: Rather have all this than a boring couch and TV anyways
[2023-08-01T18:14:07] Nick: Not looking forward to all the stupid 12v stuff I'll have to connect up
[2023-08-01T18:20:32] Mirono escooters: Waste
[2023-08-01T18:21:21] Happy Giraffe: I want it beautifulüòÅ
[2023-08-01T18:21:50] Happy Giraffe: Otherwise need to weld alu (I try to learn that aswell) but it's hell
[2023-08-01T18:21:59] Mirono escooters: Tig weld it
[2023-08-01T18:22:04] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-08-01T18:22:07] Mirono escooters: Noob
[2023-08-01T18:22:19] Mirono escooters: Man gonna grind away 9kg from 10kg alu
[2023-08-01T18:22:40] Happy Giraffe: It will be art after thatüòÅ
[2023-08-01T18:23:14] Mirono escooters: Wasteful in every way
[2023-08-01T18:42:14] Nick: Yeah I smothered it
[2023-08-01T18:42:30] Nick: I didn't take pics of after the final solder cleanup but I fluxed the shit out of it

[2023-08-01T19:52:44] Nick: I'm realizing it has room for bigger wheels which means bigger motor and maybe a second motor
[2023-08-01T19:57:08] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2023-08-01T19:57:12] Mirono escooters: Qs273 bro
[2023-08-01T20:04:07] Mirono escooters: Na go big or go home
[2023-08-01T20:04:13] Mirono escooters: Qs205 on a real motorbike is waste
[2023-08-01T20:04:29] Mirono escooters: Overheated to quick
[2023-08-01T20:09:01] Gabe Enzo: LOOOOOOOOOOOL
[2023-08-01T20:09:20] Gabe Enzo: don't use electrical tape
[2023-08-01T20:10:07] Cologne: Hey üòÉ Can i use at Flipsky 75100 gps Tracker ? Yeah or ?
[2023-08-01T20:14:57] Nick: <photos/photo_9117@01-08-2023_20-14-57.jpg>
[2023-08-01T20:15:06] Mirono escooters: Why not??
[2023-08-01T20:15:12] Mirono escooters: Gps tracker is a device on its own
[2023-08-01T20:17:06] Happy Giraffe: Ferrofluid and TurbinatorsüòÅ
[2023-08-01T20:19:09] Cologne: I just wanted to make sure once again that I didn't buy the wrong thing. Thank you very much I can use it Ya ?üòò

[2023-08-01T20:20:16] Mirono escooters: If you buy a 12v stepdown....
[2023-08-01T20:21:21] Cologne: Like this ?
[2023-08-01T20:23:24] Mirono escooters: If you find that a stepdown üëç
[2023-08-01T20:23:30] Mirono escooters: (it is not.)

[2023-08-01T20:23:59] Mirono escooters: Here you go
[2023-08-01T20:45:41] Cologne: I get this
[2023-08-01T20:45:45] Cologne: <photos/photo_9121@01-08-2023_20-45-45.jpg>
[2023-08-01T20:46:06] Cologne: Wrong Country i Think for the Link
[2023-08-01T20:46:20] Cologne: Can u Show pls again
[2023-08-01T20:47:28] Mirono escooters: Right corner
[2023-08-01T20:47:31] Mirono escooters: That's the same thing
[2023-08-01T22:11:34] Nick: Hey what all battery questions should I ask regarding what I need?
[2023-08-01T22:11:44] Finn: What?üòÇ
[2023-08-01T22:12:11] Nick: Idk yall told me earlier to ask my battery plug a bunch of things about numbers
[2023-08-01T22:12:17] Nick: 20s 24s 84v
[2023-08-01T22:12:21] Nick: Something like that
[2023-08-01T22:12:31] Finn: So what battery will you use
[2023-08-01T22:12:36] Finn: You got any plans
[2023-08-01T22:13:15] Nick: I think it will be 84v peak 72 nom but not sure so I will ask him that when he's available a bit later and there was sometging about the cell arrangement
[2023-08-01T22:13:55] Nick: It's being built rn so whatever yall advise I'll ask him to do it
[2023-08-01T22:14:23] Nick: Using this setup
[2023-08-01T22:14:27] Nick: <photos/photo_9122@01-08-2023_22-14-27.jpg>
[2023-08-01T22:15:30] Nick: Battery compartment 380mm height, 245mm length 195mm width
[2023-08-01T22:21:48] Nick: Oh I couldn't find charging connectors or anything on spintend not sure if I'm wording it wrong but there is currently no way to charge anything atm
[2023-08-01T22:24:21] Nick: Asked the chat but no response as of yet :( fast charging would be nice. Maybe a charge time of like 4hr
[2023-08-01T22:24:28] Nick: 6hr at slowest
[2023-08-01T22:31:10] Happy Giraffe: Depending what motor you use, might want to get XT150 for motor phase connectors. 4mm banana might be ok but just to be sure everything is best as it can for 2$
[2023-08-01T22:33:29] Happy Giraffe: XT90 EM connector can be mounted on a frame etc. Some versions come with rubber cover aswell.
[2023-08-01T22:34:36] Happy Giraffe: Best is to get two chargers, one slow to charge when not in hurry to save battery lifespan. One quick that is closer to cell maximum continuous charge current
[2023-08-01T22:35:40] Happy Giraffe: Yeahüëç
[2023-08-01T22:36:33] Happy Giraffe: You gotta do some soldering in the throttle etc department so be prepared for thatüòÅ
[2023-08-01T22:36:46] Nick: For now just gonna use the motor the bike comes with. Gonna upgrade piecemeal later to that qs 205 yall mentioned and a beefed up controller later on and use the old stuff for different project
[2023-08-01T22:37:16] Happy Giraffe: QS205 , xt150 minimumüòÖ
[2023-08-01T22:37:23] Nick: Should I ask artem to create it with a xt150?
[2023-08-01T22:37:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Mosfet size comparison
[2023-08-01T22:38:01] Mirono escooters: Artem ships to Amerika?
[2023-08-01T22:38:20] Nick: I'm in canada. We sorted out the import stuff more or less
[2023-08-01T22:38:36] Mirono escooters: Oooooooh
[2023-08-01T22:40:17] Happy Giraffe: But getting a vesc and making the wires etc correct lenght you gotta solder a lot haha. XT150 or awg 10 cable soldering is bit tougher and requires power from theiron
[2023-08-01T22:42:15] Nick: Is it possible to stick with xt90 for now.and do a complete overhaul later? This won't be the last motorcycle fortunately/unfortunately
[2023-08-01T22:42:25] Nick: <photos/photo_9125@01-08-2023_22-42-25.jpg>
[2023-08-01T22:42:49] Nick: I wanna speedily this thing later too so I'll use the old electronics for this when I go to 150
[2023-08-01T22:42:57] Nick: Assuming xt90 still works for what I have now
[2023-08-01T22:55:18] Gabe Enzo: how many amps?
[2023-08-01T22:55:41] Gabe Enzo: Just double up.
[2023-08-01T22:57:07] Finn: Use AS150 then pls
[2023-08-01T22:57:10] Finn: Should be enough
[2023-08-01T22:57:32] Gabe Enzo: Guess that could work
[2023-08-01T22:57:51] Finn: Too much resistance
[2023-08-01T22:58:03] Gabe Enzo: true...
[2023-08-01T22:58:15] Unknown: Got a local guy who modded a bike and chain didn't fit around new tire. He's keeping the pedals only lol.
[2023-08-01T22:58:16] Gabe Enzo: I don't take these things into consideration, probably why I burn so much shit.
[2023-08-01T22:59:01] Gabe Enzo: do you know where I can learn more about resistance?
[2023-08-01T22:59:16] Mirono escooters: Resistance is a basic electronic concept
[2023-08-01T22:59:27] Finn: Every welding point creates resistance
[2023-08-01T22:59:29] Mirono escooters: You'll learn as you go
[2023-08-01T23:00:24] Gabe Enzo: does wire length matter when making series connections.
[2023-08-01T23:00:31] Gabe Enzo: I assume that ties into resistance
[2023-08-01T23:00:41] Gabe Enzo: I see resistance as trying to blow Air through a thin straw.
[2023-08-01T23:00:49] Gabe Enzo: the shorter the straw the less resistance there is.
[2023-08-01T23:01:01] Gabe Enzo: And the fatter it is the less resistance also
[2023-08-01T23:01:04] Mirono escooters: Length of wire goes up linear with resistance
[2023-08-01T23:01:27] Gabe Enzo: there is a formula, yes?
[2023-08-01T23:01:38] Mirono escooters: Ya
[2023-08-01T23:01:54] Gabe Enzo: Last question, doubling up on cable doesn't tamper with resistance.. logically??
[2023-08-01T23:02:07] Gabe Enzo: 2 thin straws same resistance as one big straw
[2023-08-01T23:02:07] Mirono escooters: What
[2023-08-01T23:02:18] Gabe Enzo: Ok just making sure Lol
[2023-08-01T23:02:20] Gabe Enzo: thanks
[2023-08-01T23:02:21] Mirono escooters: Ja
[2023-08-01T23:04:55] Finn: Yes
[2023-08-01T23:05:08] Finn: But you wont have half the resistance bc of solder points
[2023-08-01T23:05:42] Mirono escooters: If well soldered no issue
[2023-08-01T23:05:54] Finn: Still solder creates resistance
[2023-08-01T23:06:52] Mirono escooters: If well soldered it's minimal af
[2023-08-01T23:07:00] Nick: What's the maximum amps xt90 csn do?
[2023-08-01T23:07:02] Mirono escooters: Buy a precise resistance tester and see for urself
[2023-08-01T23:07:04] Mirono escooters: 90
[2023-08-01T23:07:07] Mirono escooters: It's in the name
[2023-08-01T23:07:36] Nick: I think its enough to start with. If I go more than that I will replace the whole motor I think
[2023-08-01T23:07:55] Mirono escooters: Ya
[2023-08-01T23:08:04] Nick: I'll probably not even go near that high I'm assuming 50 will give it some pep in its step
[2023-08-01T23:08:12] Nick: 75 or something idk
[2023-08-01T23:08:15] Finn: What motor do you have Nick
[2023-08-01T23:08:18] Finn: And what controller
[2023-08-01T23:08:29] Nick: 72a yuma 12in motor
[2023-08-01T23:08:34] Nick: Stock on motorino xmb
[2023-08-01T23:08:37] Nick: And this config
[2023-08-01T23:08:41] Nick: <photos/photo_9122@01-08-2023_22-14-27.jpg>
[2023-08-01T23:10:42] Nick: If it makes out at 100kmh that will be enough to get me around town until I can OT enough at work to do some real spicy stuff. Figure I shouldn't go all out on my first huge build. Just want reliable/functional so I'll probably make mistakes and have to fix them as I go
[2023-08-01T23:10:46] Finn: What wires do you use for battery?
[2023-08-01T23:10:55] Nick: Red and black
[2023-08-01T23:11:03] Nick: Idk it's just whatever was on there
[2023-08-01T23:11:04] Finn: You for real?üòÇüòÇ
[2023-08-01T23:11:08] Nick: Or do u mean the battery itself
[2023-08-01T23:11:20] Finn: I mean cable thicness
[2023-08-01T23:11:59] Nick: 4mm good or bigger
[2023-08-01T23:12:16] Finn: Would get 8mm
[2023-08-01T23:15:11] Nick: So I should have artem build battery with xt150, use 8mm bullets, but the controller is only made for 4mm ones?
[2023-08-01T23:16:04] Finn: Xt150 for phase?üòÇ
[2023-08-01T23:16:10] Nick: Ohhh okay. So the battery will xt90 up to the controller. But controller will xt150 to motor
[2023-08-01T23:16:15] Happy Giraffe: It's niceüåö
[2023-08-01T23:16:20] Finn: Bruh naaah
[2023-08-01T23:16:29] Finn: Much better
[2023-08-01T23:16:29] Gabe Enzo: RC style
[2023-08-01T23:16:43] Happy Giraffe: Yeah depending how crazy he goes with phase currentüòÅ
[2023-08-01T23:16:52] Finn: As150 for battery as simple as that not freaking two xt90üíÄüíÄ
[2023-08-01T23:16:58] Nick: My goal to start I'd 60mph
[2023-08-01T23:17:00] Nick: Is*
[2023-08-01T23:17:04] Finn: Controller can give 200 so use 200üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-08-01T23:17:20] Finn: Okay that sucksüòÇ
[2023-08-01T23:17:26] Finn: But why two tho
[2023-08-01T23:17:33] Finn: Spinted smoked some crack or smth
[2023-08-01T23:17:52] Nick: Is there a controller thayd work better?
[2023-08-01T23:17:53] Finn: Bro jusr use awg 8 with as150
[2023-08-01T23:18:03] Finn: Spinted is good
[2023-08-01T23:18:06] Happy Giraffe: Would be harder to solder but simplerüòÅ
[2023-08-01T23:18:09] Gabe Enzo: not enough
[2023-08-01T23:18:18] Gabe Enzo: 8awg is thin
[2023-08-01T23:18:56] Gabe Enzo: Wait, for phase it might be ok
[2023-08-01T23:18:57] Gabe Enzo: nvm
[2023-08-01T23:19:49] Finn: Awg 8 is thin?
[2023-08-01T23:20:06] Finn: You ever had awg 8 in your hand?
[2023-08-01T23:20:15] Nick: So batt to esc is 2x xt90. Then I need to buy a 8awg x2 wire and 4x 8mm bullets
[2023-08-01T23:21:02] Happy Giraffe: Awg 8 cross section 8.36mmüòÇ 2.5x the one of awg 12
[2023-08-01T23:21:57] Happy Giraffe: Which T version of qs205 you got?
[2023-08-01T23:22:37] Nick: I don't have that motor yet that's a potential one I will get
[2023-08-01T23:22:43] Nick: When I'm better at building
[2023-08-01T23:23:12] Mirono escooters: Qs273;!!!
[2023-08-01T23:23:27] Nick: Yall just hate my wallet
[2023-08-01T23:23:32] Happy Giraffe: Yeah those can take a lot of powerüòÅ Tho QS273 for motorcycle is better
[2023-08-01T23:23:45] Happy Giraffe: You want a space rocketüòÇ
[2023-08-01T23:24:00] Mirono escooters: Qs205 never on motorbike
[2023-08-01T23:24:02] Mirono escooters: 273 ok
[2023-08-01T23:24:13] Mirono escooters: Ya
[2023-08-01T23:24:24] Mirono escooters: Without this group id have a yacht
[2023-08-01T23:24:26] Happy Giraffe: And Miro even has the small version of 273üòÅ
[2023-08-01T23:24:31] Mirono escooters: Not enough
[2023-08-01T23:24:37] Mirono escooters: Ayo don't bully himüò≠
[2023-08-01T23:24:40] Happy Giraffe: Not continuous riding
[2023-08-01T23:25:04] Happy Giraffe: Yeah but if he rides on highway or smth
[2023-08-01T23:25:14] Mirono escooters: Highspeed riding qs205 toast
[2023-08-01T23:25:24] Mirono escooters: My friend overheats it in bike w sabboto and 120a..
[2023-08-01T23:25:46] Nick: So stock motor assuming I run like 60 or 70a 72v 3kw motor I will get 3 sets of 8mm bullet I'll tell artem put second xt90 on battery and then connect the motor to the controller with the 8mm bullets
[2023-08-01T23:25:46] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-08-01T23:26:05] Happy Giraffe: But...if it is a motorcycle you want to build then heck no these small 200A vescs
[2023-08-01T23:27:20] Nick: Idk what to get for the charging stuff
[2023-08-01T23:27:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: Technically for phase you need bigger wire
[2023-08-01T23:28:27] Nick: <photos/photo_9127@01-08-2023_23-28-27.jpg>
[2023-08-01T23:28:30] Nick: ?
[2023-08-01T23:28:53] Nick: This was the wire u guys mentioned right
[2023-08-01T23:29:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Aluminium üëé
[2023-08-01T23:29:23] Nick: What can I use to measure
[2023-08-01T23:29:40] Nick: I have bananas
[2023-08-01T23:29:43] Nick: üçå
[2023-08-01T23:30:01] Nick: Or is it the amount t of little wires

[2023-08-01T23:34:06] Nick: I forgot what that tool is called
[2023-08-01T23:34:40] Nick: The wire tool
[2023-08-01T23:34:50] Nick: Need to buy one
[2023-08-01T23:35:30] Mirono escooters: The what
[2023-08-01T23:36:33] Finn: Wire striper
[2023-08-01T23:38:37] Nick: I can't find one that goes down to 8
[2023-08-01T23:39:19] Nick: <photos/photo_9130@01-08-2023_23-39-19.jpg>
[2023-08-01T23:39:44] Nick: Is this one good or are those wires big
[2023-08-01T23:39:58] Finn: <photos/photo_9131@01-08-2023_23-39-58.jpg>
[2023-08-01T23:42:23] Nick: Closest one to that I can find is this
[2023-08-01T23:42:28] Nick: <photos/photo_9132@01-08-2023_23-42-28.jpg>
[2023-08-01T23:43:12] Happy Giraffe: Yeah try to stick to known brands when buying tools you use again
[2023-08-01T23:43:52] Happy Giraffe: That one looks ok tho but 10awg max if thats enough
[2023-08-01T23:44:30] Mirono escooters: Just use pliers or a knive
[2023-08-01T23:44:32] Mirono escooters: Be a man ;)
[2023-08-01T23:45:22] Happy Giraffe: Yeah sharp knife will handle big cables so might as well as buy that
[2023-08-01T23:46:08] Happy Giraffe: Just make a drawing in A3/4 paper that has all electrical connections you have
[2023-08-01T23:46:23] Gabe Enzo: wire cutters only.
[2023-08-01T23:46:29] Gabe Enzo: yeah if you wanna blunt it
[2023-08-01T23:46:33] Happy Giraffe: Then you see what to buy and how to make it
[2023-08-01T23:46:58] Happy Giraffe: Lol it is to reveal cable underneath silicon case
[2023-08-01T23:48:21] Happy Giraffe: But you also need some wire cuttersüòÅ buy knipex or klein etc
[2023-08-01T23:50:16] Nick: <photos/photo_9133@01-08-2023_23-50-16.jpg>
[2023-08-01T23:52:32] Gabe Enzo: are you a millionaire by any chance?
[2023-08-01T23:52:57] Mirono escooters: 65‚Ç¨ Use a knive
[2023-08-01T23:53:12] Mirono escooters: Like rlly, I strip even 8awg with 1‚Ç¨ pliers
[2023-08-01T23:53:18] Nick: I'm confused does this measure the wire
[2023-08-01T23:53:24] Gabe Enzo: cuts.
[2023-08-01T23:53:29] Gabe Enzo: maybe for little girls who can't cut
[2023-08-01T23:53:32] Nick: Oh I can just do that
[2023-08-01T23:53:37] Nick: I want to measure it
[2023-08-01T23:53:48] Gabe Enzo: it says the awg on it it must.
[2023-08-01T23:53:50] Nick: But idk what the wire measuring tool is called
[2023-08-01T23:53:58] Gabe Enzo: there's a chart.
[2023-08-01T23:54:00] Gabe Enzo: online
[2023-08-01T23:54:29] Mirono escooters: I meant plier, it's late
[2023-08-01T23:54:40] Happy Giraffe: I meant buy the wire stripper and then buy cable cutters. One in all tool can be a bit meh
[2023-08-01T23:54:50] Mirono escooters: You mean a "schuifmaat"
[2023-08-01T23:54:53] Nick: I've used calipers once u just never knew the name
[2023-08-01T23:54:58] Nick: I*
[2023-08-01T23:55:01] Mirono escooters: Caliper
[2023-08-01T23:55:18] Mirono escooters: But it says it on the wire tho
[2023-08-01T23:56:02] Nick: I almost bought a 200 dollar wire stripping machine
[2023-08-01T23:56:21] Nick: Thinking I needed to take the wheel off and cut the motor cable to measure it

[2023-08-02T06:08:31] Happy Giraffe: Bike helmet is useless there lol
[2023-08-02T06:08:35] rosheee: nah
[2023-08-02T06:08:39] rosheee: it helped when crash
[2023-08-02T06:08:48] rosheee: but when going this faste better full moto helmet
[2023-08-02T06:08:57] Happy Giraffe: Damn you were lucky
[2023-08-02T06:09:01] rosheee: very
[2023-08-02T06:09:08] Happy Giraffe: 70 is a lot when flying
[2023-08-02T06:09:17] rosheee: no
[2023-08-02T06:09:23] rosheee: i was idiot back then
[2023-08-02T06:09:34] rosheee: at 70 i thought best is fall on back
[2023-08-02T06:09:39] rosheee: then i fall on back
[2023-08-02T06:09:43] rosheee: and hit car with 40kmh

[2023-08-02T11:34:11] Pablo Fernandez: A GT2 with 45km for 1500‚Ç¨ tempting to get It
[2023-08-02T11:34:20] Pablo Fernandez: ü•∏
[2023-08-02T12:37:55] Happy Giraffe: You cant have insurance on that so how did you solve it with the drivers?
[2023-08-02T12:39:10] Mirono escooters: Frame knackered?
[2023-08-02T16:11:51] Thierry: Which motor temp sensor for spinted? 10k or 100k?
[2023-08-02T16:12:42] Thierry: Thanks it is what I thought to read
[2023-08-02T17:02:09] –í–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∏–π: Hi all. what am I doing wrong. I want to download LISP CODE but it gives me an error . VESC 75100

[2023-08-02T17:04:23] SirGeoff: Fw 5.02 is OLD
[2023-08-02T17:05:21] –í–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∏–π: Thank you, try to find information about the update
[2023-08-02T18:02:11] Jonas: Hey Guys so I'm stuck with my vesc again, got new mks 75100. In vesc tool it came with 75300_r3 firmware. I wanna use the lisp script on Ali express m365 which is 100% possible but which firmware do I have to chose now? 75100 like always? 75300 is not working (script)
[2023-08-02T18:06:26] Jonas: I would just flash it but tbh last one didn't even make it on the road so I wanna be safe this time. The PCB got 75100 on it
[2023-08-02T18:21:14] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: What is the connector type called that the 75100 Alu PCB uses?
[2023-08-02T18:21:23] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: The very tiny small one
[2023-08-02T18:21:35] S1m 0n: Xhb?
[2023-08-02T18:22:29] S1m 0n: Or jst-xh ist the name
[2023-08-02T18:23:19] –í–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∏–π: After the firmware, I can not change the values. I also can't do a motor adaptation. But he works. What did I do wrong?
[2023-08-02T18:27:00] –í–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∏–π: Write not work
[2023-08-02T18:49:59] –í–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∏–π: Write not work. Is there a list of vesc errors somewhere?
[2023-08-02T19:12:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 75_100 has no phase filters
[2023-08-02T19:13:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: nope they are too big. I mean the small ones
[2023-08-02T19:16:38] –í–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∏–π: It's on now. I can't turn it off.
[2023-08-02T19:16:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes because the option has no effect. It's being shown but it doesn't do anything. Don't worry.
[2023-08-02T19:17:46] Mirono escooters: What? Enabling them blows up your controller. No?
[2023-08-02T19:18:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: One thing you have to take care of tho, if your 75_100 is actually 75_100 and not actually 75_100_V2. 75_100 is very very rare, if you bought it recently there is no chance you don't have the V2.
[2023-08-02T19:19:09] –í–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∏–π: <photos/photo_9167@02-08-2023_19-19-09.jpg>
[2023-08-02T19:19:25] –í–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∏–π: Is it 75100?
[2023-08-02T19:19:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Did you buy it recently?
[2023-08-02T19:19:56] –í–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∏–π: Yes. I can't turn it off
[2023-08-02T19:20:14] –í–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∏–π: Yes
[2023-08-02T19:20:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Then you need to flash 75_100_V2 or else your power readings will be wrong.
[2023-08-02T19:20:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes because it's disabled in 6.0+ firmware already, you can see the option but it's not there.
[2023-08-02T19:21:11] Mirono escooters: Oh wow
[2023-08-02T19:21:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Don't ask me why it's not just grayed out.
[2023-08-02T19:27:23] Mirono escooters: Why isn't it?
[2023-08-02T19:27:25] Mirono escooters: <sticker>

[2023-08-02T19:35:32] –í–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∏–π: 75_100V2 not work üòî
[2023-08-02T19:36:38] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Eh? You sure you are using the correct vesc tool version
[2023-08-02T19:37:14] –í–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∏–π: https://github.com/vedderb/vesc_fw_archive/blob/main/6.00/75_100/VESC_default.bin I used the firmware from here.

[2023-08-02T19:37:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Your VESC Tool is probably VESC 6.02 and you flashed VEAC 6.00 firmware
[2023-08-02T19:38:47] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: https://github.com/vedderb/vesc_fw_archive/blob/main/6.02/75_100_V2/VESC_default.bin
[2023-08-02T19:38:57] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: This is for VESC 6.02
[2023-08-02T19:46:21] –í–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∏–π: Thanks, it started working. Limited Mode means I have to buy the app now and can't change the settings? And on pc too?
[2023-08-02T19:46:45] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-08-02T19:54:13] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: ah well shit, you really had vesc tool 6.00, well that means now you have to get the newer vesc tool as well xd

[2023-08-02T19:55:48] –í–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∏–π: Yes 6.0
[2023-08-02T19:56:10] –í–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∏–π: Should I buy it?
[2023-08-02T20:00:24] Simone: i have the same, the correct firmware is 75300 R2, from pc app you can upload unlimited hardware firmware
[2023-08-02T20:40:28] SirGeoff: From 6.00 there is 75_100 and 75_100v2 firmware included. Just update and done.
[2023-08-02T20:40:53] SirGeoff: Forget the 75300 r2
[2023-08-02T20:44:40] Simone: <photos/photo_9172@02-08-2023_20-44-40.jpg>

[2023-08-03T02:27:22] Nick: When measuring the motor phase wire you guys mentioned, am I measuring just the inside copper part or the rubber part also?
[2023-08-03T02:28:34] Nick: If its the rubber part it's just 3.20
[2023-08-03T02:29:14] Nick: <photos/photo_9174@03-08-2023_02-29-14.jpg>
[2023-08-03T04:19:04] Nick: I got flux paste on my hands should I call 911
[2023-08-03T04:19:10] Nick: I heard it's acid
[2023-08-03T04:40:56] Unknown: Don't use it as lip balm and you'll be ok
[2023-08-03T04:44:15] Nick: Ac5uqlly q little bit did get in my mouth
[2023-08-03T04:44:33] Nick: Not as lip balm just because I touched my face on accident
[2023-08-03T05:12:41] Nick: <photos/photo_9175@03-08-2023_05-12-41.jpg>
[2023-08-03T05:12:45] Nick: Is this acceptable
[2023-08-03T05:13:37] Nick: Idk I'd using too much will make a bunch of resistance or what so I'm trying to get as small an amount as possible
[2023-08-03T05:24:33] Nick: <photos/photo_9176@03-08-2023_05-24-33.jpg>
[2023-08-03T05:31:24] Unknown: Did you try to smooth it after by running the iron over it again?
[2023-08-03T05:31:34] Nick: Yea
[2023-08-03T05:32:10] Nick: I have no idea what I'm doing tbh
[2023-08-03T05:32:13] Unknown: lol looks like a plasterer did soldering.
[2023-08-03T05:32:19] Unknown: Your awesome
[2023-08-03T05:32:31] Nick: I did this once with a meepo that was my only previous soldering experience
[2023-08-03T05:32:37] Nick: But all the wires were so much smaller
[2023-08-03T05:33:01] Nick: As trash as it looks will it work?
[2023-08-03T05:33:03] Unknown: It's just funny not being mean
[2023-08-03T05:33:39] Unknown: Heat it so it's a nice shiny puddle like terminator guy when he melts in a puddle
[2023-08-03T05:34:06] Unknown: Probably strip less wire
[2023-08-03T05:34:31] Nick: Should I start with a new segment
[2023-08-03T05:35:04] Unknown: Meh can't hurt heating again to practice looks like it was cold
[2023-08-03T05:37:09] Unknown: https://youtube.com/shorts/U_gNmVARkfQ?feature=share Nick
[2023-08-03T05:40:56] Nick: Maybe my shit doesn't work right I can't get solder wire to stick to the head
[2023-08-03T05:41:01] Nick: It just melts straight off
[2023-08-03T05:41:11] Nick: And hits the ground or my foot
[2023-08-03T05:42:43] Happy Giraffe: If you do this it should work
[2023-08-03T05:43:14] Unknown: Is the tip black? Should be silver otherwise it's contaminated and it won't stick. Usually from a cheap iron getting to hot and burning off the silver ish layer
[2023-08-03T05:43:49] Nick: <photos/photo_9177@03-08-2023_05-43-49.jpg>
[2023-08-03T05:44:19] Nick: I still have a value pack of new tips if this one is bad now
[2023-08-03T05:44:20] Unknown: Wipe it on a wet sponge when it's hot looks decent
[2023-08-03T05:45:13] Nick: So can I salvage this bad solder or should I start again
[2023-08-03T05:45:32] Nick: Cleaning it now
[2023-08-03T05:46:48] Nick: <photos/photo_9178@03-08-2023_05-46-48.jpg>
[2023-08-03T05:46:56] Unknown: You can re heat it but that's a lot of stripped wire. Just practice on pieces before ruining something important
[2023-08-03T05:47:06] Happy Giraffe: Should be ok, problem is somewhere else
[2023-08-03T05:47:55] Happy Giraffe: You only need like a 1/2 in stripped wire
[2023-08-03T05:48:09] Unknown: Inch not foot lol
[2023-08-03T05:48:17] Happy Giraffe: Haha
[2023-08-03T05:48:39] Unknown: Wait he's Canadian 10 to 12 mm
[2023-08-03T05:48:40] Happy Giraffe: I tried freedom units and failedüòÇ
[2023-08-03T05:48:56] Unknown: " is inch
[2023-08-03T05:48:56] Happy Giraffe: Ah yesüòÅüëç
[2023-08-03T05:50:14] Nick: Idk about inches so I will do 30mm
[2023-08-03T05:52:27] Happy Giraffe: Too much, 10mm per wire enough
[2023-08-03T05:55:31] Happy Giraffe: I solder a wire later today so can do quick demo
[2023-08-03T06:02:29] Nick: <photos/photo_9179@03-08-2023_06-02-29.jpg>
[2023-08-03T06:02:33] Nick: Too loose orntighter
[2023-08-03T06:03:55] Nick: <photos/photo_9180@03-08-2023_06-03-55.jpg>
[2023-08-03T06:06:23] Happy Giraffe: This is good
[2023-08-03T06:06:55] Nick: I'm trying to get a glob to stick to the iron but it makes it drop off really fast
[2023-08-03T06:07:05] Nick: So I csn have a glob on the bottom
[2023-08-03T06:08:30] Happy Giraffe: Then soldering iron to max power, make iron tip clean and slightly covered in solder. Then bring it under wire and apply solder between iron and cable and hold there until wire hot enough you can add solder slightly next to the hotspot
[2023-08-03T06:08:58] Happy Giraffe: Use the copper ball cleaner
[2023-08-03T06:09:22] Nick: <photos/photo_9181@03-08-2023_06-09-22.jpg>
[2023-08-03T06:09:25] Nick: This thing?
[2023-08-03T06:09:46] Happy Giraffe: Thin solder layer to hot iron and then gently rub it on that
[2023-08-03T06:09:52] Happy Giraffe: Yes
[2023-08-03T06:16:16] Happy Giraffe: Check the wattage of your iron, if its less than 40w then not suitable for these bigger wires like awg10 or 12
[2023-08-03T06:16:35] Happy Giraffe: The more power the better
[2023-08-03T08:30:27] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No, you don't have to buy anything, it is free available on vesc-project website
[2023-08-03T10:36:11] Nick: Would something like this work better? Mine says 80w but it doesn't work how it's supposed to so I think the temperature is way too low
[2023-08-03T10:36:19] Nick: <photos/photo_9182@03-08-2023_10-36-19.jpg>
[2023-08-03T10:36:47] Nick: Thus one says 90w but looks way better than what I have
[2023-08-03T10:40:00] Gabe Enzo: Its the same thing.
[2023-08-03T10:40:19] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_9183@03-08-2023_10-40-19.jpg>
[2023-08-03T10:40:23] Gabe Enzo: that's 10$
[2023-08-03T10:40:26] Nick: Is there a name brand that most ppl buy
[2023-08-03T10:40:32] Gabe Enzo: theyre all the same
[2023-08-03T10:40:40] Gabe Enzo: Ya TS is good apparently
[2023-08-03T10:40:44] Gabe Enzo: TS100
[2023-08-03T10:40:58] Gabe Enzo: needs specific tips I think tho
[2023-08-03T10:41:23] Gabe Enzo: is expensive
[2023-08-03T10:41:31] Nick: <photos/photo_9184@03-08-2023_10-41-31.jpg>
[2023-08-03T10:41:45] Gabe Enzo: unless you order from Alibaba but post is 4 weeks
[2023-08-03T10:41:50] Gabe Enzo: yea
[2023-08-03T10:42:12] Gabe Enzo: that's very good
[2023-08-03T10:42:31] Nick: Decently quick shipping. This will be hot enough though to get thru the bigger wires and make the solder melt from the top tho ?
[2023-08-03T10:42:48] Gabe Enzo: 65W? Yes.
[2023-08-03T10:42:59] Gabe Enzo: Grab a few tips if you got extra cash too.
[2023-08-03T10:43:03] Gabe Enzo: Thick tips too.
[2023-08-03T10:43:06] Gabe Enzo: Like the flat head kind
[2023-08-03T10:43:10] Nick: It looks like my vape battery one I was using for a while
[2023-08-03T10:43:14] Gabe Enzo: helps spread the solder
[2023-08-03T10:44:21] Nick: I'll probably do it next paycheck. Sucks cuz I thought the one I bought would actually be 80w but it doesn't heat up solder wire unless u touch the wire physically it won't transfer thru the copper
[2023-08-03T10:44:38] Gabe Enzo: It is 80w.
[2023-08-03T10:44:45] Gabe Enzo: Your tip is dead
[2023-08-03T10:44:53] Gabe Enzo: the tips on those never last long. only a few hours
[2023-08-03T10:44:57] Nick: I have a bunch of new ones still
[2023-08-03T10:45:19] Gabe Enzo: Try them on. Just DONT disassemble the pen while it's hot
[2023-08-03T10:45:24] Gabe Enzo: or the metal will fuse
[2023-08-03T10:45:29] Gabe Enzo: did that once before
[2023-08-03T10:45:35] Gabe Enzo: use a fat one.
[2023-08-03T10:45:40] Nick: Are the ts100 tips more durable?
[2023-08-03T10:46:01] Gabe Enzo: Yeah, also u can buy Hakko tips for those cheap soldering irons and they last like months
[2023-08-03T10:46:07] Gabe Enzo: super expensive tho
[2023-08-03T10:46:19] Nick: So my iron isn't the problem it's the tip
[2023-08-03T10:46:50] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_9185@03-08-2023_10-46-50.jpg>
[2023-08-03T10:46:51] Gabe Enzo: Yeah
[2023-08-03T10:46:58] Gabe Enzo: change it in half an hour.
[2023-08-03T10:47:00] Gabe Enzo: You'll see
[2023-08-03T10:47:12] Gabe Enzo: using those cheap ones you got
[2023-08-03T10:47:17] Gabe Enzo: I just ordered these last night
[2023-08-03T10:47:38] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_9186@03-08-2023_10-47-38.jpg>
[2023-08-03T10:48:10] Nick: Can't find any hakko ones other than a conical is Saitek another good brand?
[2023-08-03T10:48:16] Nick: Saipor*
[2023-08-03T10:48:28] Gabe Enzo: Do you have spare ones beside you right now?
[2023-08-03T10:48:53] Gabe Enzo: they're all the same Chinese crap, I see them as consumables. Saipor seems to be OK tho.
[2023-08-03T10:49:00] Gabe Enzo: Hakko is Japanese
[2023-08-03T10:49:07] Gabe Enzo: So it's better.
[2023-08-03T10:50:56] Nick: <photos/photo_9187@03-08-2023_10-50-56.jpg>
[2023-08-03T10:51:03] Nick: Are these okay?
[2023-08-03T10:51:18] Gabe Enzo: They look the same as mine but not painted black.
[2023-08-03T10:51:20] Gabe Enzo: Yea.
[2023-08-03T10:51:38] Nick: So basically they're good for one use and you toss them
[2023-08-03T10:51:46] Nick: Like needles on syringe
[2023-08-03T10:52:01] Gabe Enzo: A few uses if you're lucky.
[2023-08-03T10:52:06] Gabe Enzo: also don't press on them too hard
[2023-08-03T10:52:13] Gabe Enzo: when they're hot
[2023-08-03T10:52:23] Gabe Enzo: Yes exactly
[2023-08-03T10:52:59] Gabe Enzo: I used one that was damaged and broke my ESC so there's that. Never use damaged ones
[2023-08-03T10:53:10] Gabe Enzo: If they start to get fucked up then trash em
[2023-08-03T10:53:18] Gabe Enzo: don't reuse
[2023-08-03T10:53:25] Gabe Enzo: VERY good for first solder tho
[2023-08-03T10:53:27] Gabe Enzo: guaranteed
[2023-08-03T10:54:35] Nick: Is it the solder wire material that messes it up or the heat?
[2023-08-03T11:27:48] Happy Giraffe: I think the matter is just doing the soldering in the correct way if you are just starting. 80w is plenty
[2023-08-03T11:29:04] Happy Giraffe: Emm...I used tips for monthsüòÇ Some work after a year
[2023-08-03T11:56:39] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <photos/photo_9188@03-08-2023_11-56-39.jpg>
[2023-08-03T11:57:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: So it's GH1.27mm, hmm, where do I get this in Denmark üíÄ
[2023-08-03T11:57:34] Mirono escooters: Not
[2023-08-03T12:01:14] Happy Giraffe: Amazon.deüòÅ
[2023-08-03T12:01:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But I have no address üòî
[2023-08-03T12:01:38] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I'm homeless
[2023-08-03T12:02:17] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, you have some friends there?
[2023-08-03T12:03:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No
[2023-08-03T12:03:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But maybe I can let them ship it to a Amazon pickup box, but first I need to figure out where to stay
[2023-08-03T12:03:34] Mirono escooters: Amazon didn't even have these connectors
[2023-08-03T12:03:41] Mirono escooters: For me
[2023-08-03T12:07:01] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yup I can't really find any. GH1.25 yes some, but unbelievable expensive, GH1.27 nope.
[2023-08-03T12:09:17] Mirono escooters: Pass by BE
[2023-08-03T12:19:11] Happy Giraffe: You are two years late I would have lived there thenüòÅ
[2023-08-03T12:19:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: üòÇ yeah
[2023-08-03T12:19:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Too far üòÇ
[2023-08-03T12:20:03] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Now on my way to Kopenhagen
[2023-08-03T12:23:04] Happy Giraffe: Christiania*
[2023-08-03T12:23:10] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-08-03T14:58:18] Cologne: Hey somebody Know how can i deacitveted KERS in Vesc Tool ? When in set Battery Current Max Regen 0 i have no Elektronik Rear Brake üò±üò® What can i do pls
[2023-08-03T14:59:50] Happy Giraffe: Of course you don't have, kers needs to go to battery in order to work
[2023-08-03T15:00:04] Happy Giraffe: Start with -5A
[2023-08-03T15:00:13] Mirono escooters: Kers?? Or you mean ebrake?
[2023-08-03T15:00:31] Happy Giraffe: The bms is not designed to take a lot of amps back to battery
[2023-08-03T15:00:34] Cologne: E brake
[2023-08-03T15:00:50] Mirono escooters: Why tf u set 0 and be surprised it doesn't work
[2023-08-03T15:01:20] Happy Giraffe: I told him to test first without to see that everything works and then set a small amount
[2023-08-03T15:01:29] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-08-03T15:01:29] Mirono escooters: ü•≤
[2023-08-03T15:01:34] Cologne: Because That
[2023-08-03T15:02:03] Cologne: I dont want this like Kers ,or ?
[2023-08-03T15:02:11] Mirono escooters: It's not kers
[2023-08-03T15:02:18] Mirono escooters: It's when you brake with a linear lever or throttle
[2023-08-03T15:02:37] Happy Giraffe: Kers and ebrake and regen whatever you call it lol
[2023-08-03T15:03:20] Mirono escooters: That's next level
[2023-08-03T15:03:23] Cologne: Ok
[2023-08-03T15:03:38] Cologne: Thx i thougt That were Kers
[2023-08-03T15:03:56] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-08-03T15:04:16] Cologne: üòÇ
[2023-08-03T15:05:09] Cologne: What is there as a name under Help. It looks exactly like Kers
[2023-08-03T15:05:33] Mirono escooters: Kers is auto brake when release throttle
[2023-08-03T15:05:37] Mirono escooters: Ebrake is.. ebrake
[2023-08-03T15:06:06] Cologne: I can't get that set correctly either. Could help me find out what exactly I can set there.pls
[2023-08-03T15:10:27] Cologne: It's nice to be able to drive quietly at the beginning and then get more and more power, but it Feels through to the end for me in front of Theorie. Press that there is no more power.
[2023-08-03T15:10:41] Cologne: Throttle
[2023-08-03T15:11:46] Cologne: At the beginning, the Super pulls strongly, but as soon as I get more gas pressure and get to the end. Not much is coming anymore.
[2023-08-03T15:15:24] Cologne: This 10% means More accurate ?
[2023-08-03T15:19:35] Happy Giraffe: Then select exponential curve and put 0% to Expo
[2023-08-03T15:21:41] Cologne: Like this ?üôà
[2023-08-03T15:22:59] Cologne: Or this ? How ? Sorry üôà
[2023-08-03T15:23:04] Cologne: <photos/photo_9193@03-08-2023_15-23-04.jpg>
[2023-08-03T15:25:20] Cologne: My Stock was 0 at beginng
[2023-08-03T15:54:42] Ion: https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricScooters/comments/15gnfpl/latest_update_on_the_90mph_scooter_project/ interesting thing I saw on reddit... Someone from here?
[2023-08-03T16:01:41] Ion: Yeah... That's not the base to go 90mph on I would say. Just look at the stem-deck connection and general build. GT2 maybe (someone has done it here), but idk about that
[2023-08-03T16:02:40] Ion: But 13" tires sound interesting. Didn't know that was a thing. Thing must be huge
[2023-08-03T16:02:53] Pablo Fernandez: 90 mph on a extendable stem mm
[2023-08-03T16:03:01] Pablo Fernandez: teverun supreme has 13 inches stock
[2023-08-03T16:09:23] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: You are trying to set up a throttle curve on VESC Remote which you don't have ü§î
[2023-08-03T16:09:42] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Of course it won't work.
[2023-08-03T16:10:04] Cologne: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ shit ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What Must i do üôàüôàüôàüôàüôà
[2023-08-03T16:10:14] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: That just means you don't have enough power :))
[2023-08-03T16:11:39] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: You can use the throttle curve only with ADC. This means, Vesc 6.05 required (to run dashboard script with ADC) + enable ADC app. https://youtu.be/kX8PsaxfoXQ
[2023-08-03T16:15:47] Cologne: Thx Zuna
[2023-08-03T16:19:25] Gabe Enzo: Seems they haven't had a crash yet.
[2023-08-03T16:19:48] Gabe Enzo: And it's so thin..
[2023-08-03T16:20:27] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_9194@03-08-2023_16-20-27.jpg>
[2023-08-03T16:22:03] Pablo Fernandez: i wouldnt trust that at 90mph but tbf 90mph is just insane, only escooter i would try is gt2
[2023-08-03T16:32:48] Ion: ... apparently "I don't understand" and "the suspension is 5x better than the GT2s" and "Chinese frames are better than Segway". Btw it will have a damper on it.
[2023-08-03T18:26:39] Happy Giraffe: Lmao I didnt even see that
[2023-08-03T18:27:38] Happy Giraffe: Bro just called him Zuna when his profile says god please noüòÇ
[2023-08-03T18:29:15] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Even my mother called me Zuna üíÄ
[2023-08-03T18:42:38] Nick: https://a.co/d/8cJ7bp3
[2023-08-03T18:42:41] Nick: Good or nah
[2023-08-03T18:43:04] Nick: Shit has dials on it so it must be good right
[2023-08-03T18:47:38] Gabe Enzo: Its the same soldering iron.
[2023-08-03T18:47:50] Gabe Enzo: it just has a bunch of shit to trick you into thinking it's something else.
[2023-08-03T18:47:59] Gabe Enzo: its the one I have lmfao
[2023-08-03T18:50:26] Nick: I feel like mine doesn't heat up or the wire I'm trying to solder is too big I'm not sure
[2023-08-03T18:50:45] Gabe Enzo: wait for the new tips.
[2023-08-03T18:50:46] Nick: Even with new tip I couldn't get the wire hot enough for solder to melt
[2023-08-03T18:50:57] Gabe Enzo: They came already?
[2023-08-03T18:51:01] Nick: I used all the ones that came with the Soldering iron
[2023-08-03T18:51:10] Nick: Other ones come later today
[2023-08-03T18:51:21] Gabe Enzo: wait for them. If those don't work then buy a new iron
[2023-08-03T18:52:21] Nick: https://a.co/d/6YgYpOe
[2023-08-03T18:52:28] Nick: This is the exact one I have
[2023-08-03T18:53:41] Gabe Enzo: Does it get hot enough to poke holes in cardboard boxes?
[2023-08-03T18:53:53] Gabe Enzo: as it is now
[2023-08-03T18:56:17] Nick: Hot enough to burn a chicken nugget
[2023-08-03T18:57:00] Nick: I think it'd light cardboard on fire
[2023-08-03T18:58:26] Gabe Enzo: wait
[2023-08-03T18:58:32] Gabe Enzo: what do you mean by getting wire hot enough
[2023-08-03T18:58:37] Gabe Enzo: You're not meant to heat the wire
[2023-08-03T18:58:41] Gabe Enzo: You're meant to drop solder on it
[2023-08-03T18:58:53] Gabe Enzo: the wire absorbs the solder
[2023-08-03T18:59:01] Gabe Enzo: then it's good.
[2023-08-03T18:59:15] Nick: I thought u put iron under copper solder on top and the solder is supposed to melt against the hot copper
[2023-08-03T18:59:19] Gabe Enzo: NO
[2023-08-03T18:59:34] Gabe Enzo: That is not how
[2023-08-03T19:00:10] Gabe Enzo: Tin the iron and then slowly add solder wire to the iron tip whilst it is in contact with the cable.
[2023-08-03T19:00:26] Simone: OMG
[2023-08-03T19:01:32] Nick: That's how I did it the first time and I was told to do it the way I deacribe
[2023-08-03T19:01:36] Nick: On YouTube also
[2023-08-03T19:01:56] Gabe Enzo: I'll send you a video.
[2023-08-03T19:01:58] Gabe Enzo: wait a minute.
[2023-08-03T19:02:06] Gabe Enzo: a video without an idiot doing it
[2023-08-03T19:03:40] Nick: On YouTube it was called cold soldering so I thought it's wrong
[2023-08-03T19:05:11] Gabe Enzo: https://youtu.be/uPSOzxlx2t0
[2023-08-03T19:05:20] Gabe Enzo: 13:00 onwards.
[2023-08-03T19:07:18] Gabe Enzo: That is the proper way
[2023-08-03T19:07:28] Gabe Enzo: u learn as u go
[2023-08-03T19:08:38] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_9196@03-08-2023_19-08-38.jpg>
[2023-08-03T19:08:47] Gabe Enzo: Points are pre tinned so you only stick them together
[2023-08-03T19:08:51] Gabe Enzo: With a bit of heat
[2023-08-03T19:10:20] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_9197@03-08-2023_19-10-20.jpg>
[2023-08-03T19:10:23] Gabe Enzo: Tin like this
[2023-08-03T19:10:26] Gabe Enzo: then brush onto wire
[2023-08-03T19:10:32] Nick: https://youtube.com/shorts/2GRyfD4qWBY?feature=share
[2023-08-03T19:10:38] Nick: This is what I was trying to do
[2023-08-03T19:10:45] Gabe Enzo: is that hot glue LOL
[2023-08-03T19:11:37] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_9198@03-08-2023_19-11-37.jpg>
[2023-08-03T19:11:42] Gabe Enzo: he's doing it at the wrong end
[2023-08-03T19:11:44] Gabe Enzo: He's an idiot
[2023-08-03T19:11:59] Gabe Enzo: You need tip contact
[2023-08-03T19:12:01] Happy Giraffe: This is garbage, he has a dry tip that doesnt even transfer heatüòÇ
[2023-08-03T19:12:45] Happy Giraffe: He got the flux bukkake heating it all lmao
[2023-08-03T19:13:46] Gabe Enzo: https://youtube.com/shorts/iVcX3O_KHMM?feature=share
[2023-08-03T19:13:55] Gabe Enzo: Nick
[2023-08-03T19:14:10] Gabe Enzo: watch that
[2023-08-03T19:18:16] Gabe Enzo: You can twist if you want. Doesn't change much. depends what your style is.
[2023-08-03T19:18:26] Gabe Enzo: Just don't twist it hard or the solder can't be absorbed
[2023-08-03T19:18:32] Gabe Enzo: like that idiot did in that video
[2023-08-03T19:18:36] Gabe Enzo: leave air
[2023-08-03T19:18:37] Gabe Enzo: gaps
[2023-08-03T19:19:07] Nick: How perfect does it actually need to be? Because my first couple solders the wires made solid contact but it just looked shitty but idk if there's a ton of resistance added if I use too much solder
[2023-08-03T19:19:19] Nick: <photos/photo_9175@03-08-2023_05-12-41.jpg>
[2023-08-03T19:20:37] Gabe Enzo: If you're 100% convinced it will hold forever.
[2023-08-03T19:20:47] Gabe Enzo: That's when it's perfect.
[2023-08-03T19:20:57] Gabe Enzo: If not redo it
[2023-08-03T19:21:25] Nick: Yeah it was just a huge amount of solder. So if there's little stray wires or it looks a little sloppy it's okay it'll still put the right amount t of electricity?
[2023-08-03T19:21:53] Gabe Enzo: as long as those stray wires don't poke out of the heatshrink when it squeezes and cause a short.
[2023-08-03T19:22:16] Gabe Enzo: think of it like rolling a joint with stems in it.
[2023-08-03T19:22:17] Nick: Well shit my first solder would have been fine
[2023-08-03T19:23:14] Nick: I tried to light one with the soldering iron and almost lit my house on fire
[2023-08-03T19:23:30] Gabe Enzo: Lighter only.
[2023-08-03T19:23:32] Gabe Enzo: Jet works best
[2023-08-03T19:24:05] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2023-08-03T19:24:27] Nick: I have a smaller one of those. Can u solder with it
[2023-08-03T19:24:32] Gabe Enzo: No
[2023-08-03T19:24:46] Gabe Enzo: Also solder with glasses on
[2023-08-03T19:25:39] Gabe Enzo: Wouldn't be nice to get lava into your eyes
[2023-08-03T19:25:46] Gabe Enzo: actual molten metal

[2023-08-03T19:38:34] Gabe Enzo: Learning physics the hard way
[2023-08-03T19:39:10] Gabe Enzo: lol last time I made a pack, the wire was too long and hit the rail
[2023-08-03T19:39:18] Finn: I have arround 8 years of experience and bro without anything wet it cant just hit your eyes
[2023-08-03T19:39:32] Finn: physics ü§ì
[2023-08-03T19:39:35] Gabe Enzo: It can if you add force on it.
[2023-08-03T19:39:40] Gabe Enzo: Like pulling when desoldering
[2023-08-03T19:39:42] Finn: no
[2023-08-03T19:39:47] Finn: if there are air gaps maybe
[2023-08-03T19:40:52] Finn: Its 3s 10p with 25Ah haha

[2023-08-03T19:58:45] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I always need something to press the cable down
[2023-08-03T20:00:59] Diego: Ragazzi di esc che supportano Vesc ce ne sono molti, quali mi consigliate per avere una corrente di max 50A tra i 15S-20S? Ci sono modelli poco spinti che supportano questo range di valori? Se li avete comprati come quello che cerco, qual'√® il suo costo?Esc guys that support Vesc there are many, which ones do you recommend to have a current of max 50A between 15S-20S? Are there low-end models that support this range of values? If you bought them like what I'm looking for, what's the cost?
[2023-08-03T20:01:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Makerbase 75100 Alu PCB is the most capable budget option up to 20S.
[2023-08-03T20:02:13] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DE9TKAl
[2023-08-03T20:02:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I would recommend the Spintend 80v 100A Alu PCB as well, but it's only up to 18S.
[2023-08-03T20:08:24] Thierry: Received it today üòÉ. But intend to use it for 20s without regen

[2023-08-04T03:23:47] Nick: My living room looks worse every time I see it
[2023-08-04T03:24:05] Gabe Enzo: Best part of doing a project.
[2023-08-04T03:24:38] Nick: I hope eventually this just ends with a working motorcycle and a living room with a couch and a TV in it
[2023-08-04T03:24:43] Nick: And a coffee tableeee
[2023-08-04T03:38:06] Nick: Next build will be a electric minivan with a frame made out of 2x4
[2023-08-04T03:38:59] Nick: Couldn't have been an escooter it had to be a 300lb ebike
[2023-08-04T04:25:30] Nick: Considering new motor. Any good 12inch hubs that run cheap that you guys know of? I have to replace the dry rotted tire anyways so figure why not put a whole new moyor
[2023-08-04T06:19:41] Unknown: I have a table and TV but always sit in my basement with my junk piles.
[2023-08-04T07:33:01] Nick: Decided to solder outside so I won't taste colors after 10min
[2023-08-04T07:37:25] Nick: Is this video valid?

[2023-08-04T08:31:29] Nick: From a harness I bought. Will this work for battery to controller?
[2023-08-04T09:05:04] Nick: Solder is good but the battery terminal cable goes into a wierd Y spit the manufacturer did
[2023-08-04T09:05:54] Nick: <photos/photo_9206@04-08-2023_09-05-54.jpg>
[2023-08-04T09:06:28] Nick: And I assume that goes thru the guage cluster somehow

[2023-08-04T11:32:18] Nick: I think I'm gonna trash most of the old gauges and motorcycle key and go digital is there a kit online that works well with spintend?
[2023-08-04T11:32:48] Nick: Digital dash and maybe twist throttle
[2023-08-04T11:46:21] Mihail: Why not use them?
[2023-08-04T11:59:07] Nick: Wierd ignition key thing
[2023-08-04T12:00:13] Nick: <photos/photo_9208@04-08-2023_12-00-13.jpg>
[2023-08-04T12:01:07] Nick: The ignition switch disconnects the main battery cable I think
[2023-08-04T12:01:14] Thierry: Spinted ball üòÖ
[2023-08-04T12:01:22] Nick: Rather have software and bfc
[2023-08-04T12:15:49] Zak: Nick can you please throw those battery cables in the bin because they are shit and will melt. Get some silicone multi stranded wire, 8 or 10awg at a minimum
[2023-08-04T12:30:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: For the record, I blew up one of my dual motor VESCs, but it was the one where all things were connected to like display etc. Now to the point, seems VESC can run just fine when you remove the whole power stage from the circuit and power only the DC converter and use it as CAN bridge. üòÇ
[2023-08-04T12:30:40] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It is hella confused, but it works.
[2023-08-04T12:31:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: That saved my vacation üòÇ. Also I couldn't connect it to the other ESC because it's a different model and plugs are not compatible.

[2023-08-04T16:11:29] Gabe Enzo: waste of money and shipping
[2023-08-04T16:33:45] Nick: Bought it before my vsett 10 got stolen it was a whole battery case type deal.

[2023-08-04T17:33:25] Gabe Enzo: I have it
[2023-08-04T17:33:55] Simone: l'm going to explode something, 75100 vesc 72 V battery
[2023-08-04T17:35:26] Simone: <photos/photo_9213@04-08-2023_17-35-26.jpg>
[2023-08-04T17:51:25] Mirono escooters: Oh boy that diff volt
[2023-08-04T17:51:39] Mirono escooters: Who.. made that?
[2023-08-04T17:58:36] Oreo huzky: How you not getting motor stutter?
[2023-08-04T17:59:45] Mirono escooters: Wait and 75100, 260a?
[2023-08-04T18:07:58] Simone: <video_file>
[2023-08-04T18:09:04] Simone: rhe vesc is inside, mosfet have a big alluminum plate
[2023-08-04T18:10:29] Simone: i have a 16" inch hub motor
[2023-08-04T18:11:09] Simone: i have a balancer, bit after 250A i have some problem
[2023-08-04T18:23:11] Simone: <photos/photo_9214@04-08-2023_18-23-11.jpg>
[2023-08-04T18:23:21] Mirono escooters: That's not good. It shouldn't happen
[2023-08-04T18:23:34] Mirono escooters: üôà
[2023-08-04T18:27:02] Oreo huzky: Ah
[2023-08-04T18:27:07] Oreo huzky: Magnet size?

[2023-08-04T18:43:06] Happy Giraffe: I wonder if the motor sutter is saturation of motor or esc not able to stay steadyü§î
[2023-08-04T18:43:42] Happy Giraffe: I get that at 120A phase, poor 20mm rotorüòÇ
[2023-08-04T18:43:59] Mirono escooters: Both. Saturation and Esc not keeping track because values shift
[2023-08-04T18:44:28] Simone: of course, is very modular
[2023-08-04T18:44:53] Simone: from 100 kmh to 0 in some seconds
[2023-08-04T18:45:17] Simone: in profile i use 70% of max regen current
[2023-08-04T18:45:53] Simone: i don't use brake le el now
[2023-08-04T18:46:47] Simone: no, is very linear
[2023-08-04T18:47:45] Simone: from aliexpress
[2023-08-04T18:48:23] Simone: and i use every day, very happy of this configuration
[2023-08-04T18:48:34] Simone: a real powerful scooter
[2023-08-04T18:49:10] Simone: more better than commercial, i have big size wheels and it give me a lot of security in the street
[2023-08-04T18:49:16] Simone: is like a bike
[2023-08-04T19:07:58] Happy Giraffe: Btw thinking of CYCX1 Pro 3 gen with enviolo rear hub gearbox. That can take 100nm input torque so that could be a setup without ever overheating and also throttle support
[2023-08-04T19:08:01] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-08-04T19:25:53] Mihail: Added enable wire to a friend's flipskys
[2023-08-04T19:31:26] Mihail: First time opening this alu version, looks very well made. But in terms of pcb layout and components they cheaped out a lot and optimized it for fast and cheap mass production, very little decoupling and far from components. But thats the price to pay for single side assembly. On the other hand, the aluminum box is very nice.
[2023-08-04T19:34:28] Mirono escooters: Yeh if bms cut Rip vesc
[2023-08-04T19:34:38] Mirono escooters: Alupcb be nice
[2023-08-04T19:34:45] Mirono escooters: How did u do turnoff? NC or NO
[2023-08-04T19:37:03] Mihail: It is a direct connection to the regulator's enable pin, short to GND to turn off. I usually add 100k resistor in the switch and actively pull enable to Vbat to avoid noise related issues.
[2023-08-04T19:39:26] Mihail: This can be fixed with better gate drivers with uvlo. The original eg3112 is garbage üóëÔ∏è
[2023-08-04T19:39:38] Mirono escooters: Sad they cheap out
[2023-08-04T19:39:44] Mirono escooters: Just a lil more ‚Ç¨ and it would be so goood
[2023-08-04T19:41:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: Like what? I mean with same pin out
[2023-08-04T19:41:09] Mihail: Better drivers would cost like 1-2 euro more for all 3 of them. Adding enable would be also good. But they have antispark waste to sell
[2023-08-04T19:44:36] Mirono escooters: Bweh
[2023-08-04T19:45:03] Mihail: There are some options on lcsc, I found them while choosing driver for my controller. I chose l6498 but it is different pinout. But there are options with the EG layout, it is relatively standard.
[2023-08-04T19:47:22] Mihail: I had multiple bms cutoffs, no issues at all handling them. Normal 75100 would have died for sure.
[2023-08-04T19:48:15] Mihail: I was a bit unsure if uvlo would help, but it seems to be doing all the difference.
[2023-08-05T06:10:26] Simone: where is this script ?
[2023-08-05T07:51:16] Unknown: Hi I wanted information on this type of vesc, I have a 72v 20ah battery Cells 21700 40T bms jk smart 240a maximum, this type of vesc would be Making it work at 60a on the engine? A thousand thanks
[2023-08-05T07:52:35] Unknown: I state that I do not understand anything about vesc ...
[2023-08-05T07:53:18] Unknown: Obviously I know how to program a little something, then maybe if I don't know something, can you give me a hand?
[2023-08-05T10:45:04] Ofek üê•: Start by searching in this group for 75100 and you will find ton of answers https://t.me/VescHelpGroup/141191

[2023-08-05T15:08:10] sombre_enfant: Is it possible to only buy the display with card on io hawk website or it need more stuff ?
[2023-08-05T15:08:54] Mirono escooters: That's.. actually not a bad idea
[2023-08-05T15:08:58] Mirono escooters: To do
[2023-08-05T15:09:03] Mirono escooters: It's possible, Vsett ppl upgrade to it
[2023-08-05T15:09:37] sombre_enfant: I have old vsett display sadly...
[2023-08-05T15:11:07] Mirono escooters: Ya same protocol wich is cool
[2023-08-05T15:27:38] Unknown: Understood thanks what do you recommend that is not complicated?
[2023-08-05T15:32:35] sombre_enfant: Why adc board ? Its for Throttle?
[2023-08-05T15:36:10] Unknown: is it difficult to program?
[2023-08-05T15:37:57] Happy Giraffe: No, all vesc are the same. You need just a basic understanding of english parameter names. People here can help with the rest.
[2023-08-05T15:38:47] Happy Giraffe: Basically you let vesc auto-test motor and then set maximum currents and voltage limits and throttle input. Thats all
[2023-08-05T15:43:46] Unknown: Thanks can I send the link to see if it's ok?

[2023-08-05T17:01:15] Unknown: but later I have to put two of these instead that is one that controls two motors
[2023-08-05T17:05:12] KierreKikkeli: üòÇ
[2023-08-05T17:06:34] KierreKikkeli: Bought the izuna's guides 200A spintend üëç
[2023-08-05T17:08:00] KierreKikkeli: Good esc is a long term purchase or something -happy
[2023-08-05T17:10:56] KierreKikkeli: Not sure tho that does it work with my 20A 12s only until i get a new battery 13-14s prob maybe even 15s if affordable but need to save for it
[2023-08-05T17:11:23] KierreKikkeli: Yes
[2023-08-05T17:11:39] KierreKikkeli: Oke

[2023-08-05T17:12:50] KierreKikkeli: yeah thats what i understood
[2023-08-05T17:14:09] KierreKikkeli: yea xd
[2023-08-05T17:14:34] KierreKikkeli: but should last forever and any weather conditions so underloaded
[2023-08-05T17:15:43] KierreKikkeli: and if i need to upgrade in the future to a different scooter like the g30 or pro2 or something not released yet i can use the same controller
[2023-08-05T17:16:16] KierreKikkeli: yup
[2023-08-05T17:16:32] KierreKikkeli: its gonna have a vsett 10+ when i get a better battery xd
[2023-08-05T17:17:16] KierreKikkeli: already have a vsett motor
[2023-08-05T17:17:23] KierreKikkeli: with brake disc
[2023-08-05T17:17:38] KierreKikkeli: got it for cheap from norway
[2023-08-05T17:18:18] KierreKikkeli: yeah, it has connectors on it aswell already so extra nice xd
[2023-08-05T17:19:39] KierreKikkeli: but yeah planning to go max 14s 40-60A, only need to get around 45-50kmh speeds, anything over would be prob overkill for the essential body xd
[2023-08-05T17:21:04] KierreKikkeli: yayy, now i just need the ADC adapter and a battery xd
[2023-08-05T17:24:06] KierreKikkeli: dont i kinda need the adc for rear and front lights tho?
[2023-08-05T17:24:22] KierreKikkeli: + turn signal possibility
[2023-08-05T17:24:47] KierreKikkeli: incase i need to register it as a moped or something similiar xd makes it also safer to drive here
[2023-08-05T17:26:00] KierreKikkeli: yeah
[2023-08-05T17:26:56] KierreKikkeli: wonder tho if the vesc will work with my 44v 12s 20A and stock motor until then
[2023-08-05T17:28:00] KierreKikkeli: yayy
[2023-08-05T18:47:27] Happy Giraffe: He has Vsett motor thoüòÅ
[2023-08-05T18:48:15] Happy Giraffe: Knowing spintend cooling design, nothing is overkill for those guys using thermal pads the wrong height

[2023-08-05T19:08:52] Nick: I was still using it when only the bottom was leaking black
[2023-08-05T19:09:08] Nick: But once the lines started I couldn't type anymore
[2023-08-05T19:18:30] Nick: Actually qs205 v3 with a matching front might be the move.
[2023-08-05T19:18:54] Nick: But my bank account needs more time fk
[2023-08-05T19:35:57] AK: Define old

[2023-08-05T19:50:00] Happy Giraffe: Damn
[2023-08-05T19:50:30] Happy Giraffe: You need to check rear dropout axle diameter and lenght between dropouts
[2023-08-05T19:52:22] Nick: The design is wierdly tall so it looks like it'll take anything
[2023-08-05T19:52:29] Nick: Motorino xmb
[2023-08-05T19:53:00] Happy Giraffe: Need dropout width

[2023-08-05T21:13:06] Mirono escooters: Front????
[2023-08-05T21:13:20] Mirono escooters: Nooo. Youll slip fall
[2023-08-05T21:13:25] Mirono escooters: Bike is enough with 1 big rear
[2023-08-05T21:13:34] Mirono escooters: Front is so bad even 250w üíÄ
[2023-08-05T21:25:21] Happy Giraffe: Pls no front wtf lmao
[2023-08-05T21:25:37] Happy Giraffe: Its a suicide

[2023-08-05T22:09:16] Mirono escooters: Owo
[2023-08-05T22:12:17] Gabe Enzo: not enough for a car sadly
[2023-08-05T22:12:57] Gabe Enzo: What would you use it for?
[2023-08-05T22:13:07] Gabe Enzo: Electric motorbike?
[2023-08-05T22:14:02] Mirono escooters: Vesc isn't the goal for a car
[2023-08-05T22:15:19] Happy Giraffe: For a small one yesüòÅ
[2023-08-05T22:15:29] Gabe Enzo: There is no consumer ESC that would output 500kw no?
[2023-08-05T22:15:38] Mirono escooters: Sure is
[2023-08-05T22:15:55] Gabe Enzo: is it based on VESC üòÇ
[2023-08-05T22:16:00] Gabe Enzo: how much would they even cost
[2023-08-05T22:16:12] Happy Giraffe: 50kw is more than the typical smart cars haveüòÅ
[2023-08-05T22:16:23] Gabe Enzo: oh smart cars are a hunk of shit.
[2023-08-05T22:16:26] AK: 500kw consumer purchasable?
[2023-08-05T22:16:31] AK: Surreal
[2023-08-05T22:16:39] Gabe Enzo: only Tesla's have actual horsepower.
[2023-08-05T22:16:53] Happy Giraffe: 500kw portable nuclear reactor
[2023-08-05T22:17:09] Gabe Enzo: Still need a controller xd
[2023-08-05T22:18:01] Gabe Enzo: Tesla's have 700kw.
[2023-08-05T22:18:28] Gabe Enzo: Tesla model S
[2023-08-05T22:19:21] Gabe Enzo: 760* On plaid mode.
[2023-08-05T22:28:58] Happy Giraffe: We all know, but this esc is less than 1küòÅ
[2023-08-05T22:31:55] Mirono escooters: Pocket change
[2023-08-05T22:33:05] Happy Giraffe: Should I buy a 50cc moped frame later and put QS138 70/90H in and register it as 45kmh?üòÅ
[2023-08-05T22:33:27] Happy Giraffe: Then vesc profile goes brr and suddenly moped goed 0-100 in 6 secs
[2023-08-05T22:33:47] Mirono escooters: Ya
[2023-08-05T22:33:49] Mirono escooters: You should
[2023-08-05T22:33:55] Mirono escooters: Join the moped gang
[2023-08-05T22:51:19] Happy Giraffe: I can have 500A phase but when police steps in its 45kmh 3kwüòÅ
[2023-08-05T22:59:05] Mirono escooters: cries in 25kmh

[2023-08-06T00:40:44] Face de Pin Suc√©: No, won't happen with those capas...
[2023-08-06T00:41:19] Simone: I was thinking about putting it on the super73... üëç
[2023-08-06T01:17:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: Have you seen what they putted ?
[2023-08-06T01:18:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: Only 5 caps, and small capacity
[2023-08-06T01:18:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: Dealing with high currents need more caps
[2023-08-06T01:20:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: Should we talk about tronic caps?üòÇüòÇ
[2023-08-06T01:21:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: Total ~600uF , even less than xiaomi ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2023-08-06T01:27:40] Oreo huzky: What‚Äôs wrong with the mouse
[2023-08-06T01:28:37] Oreo huzky: make 4 motors for each wheel then should be enough
[2023-08-06T01:28:51] Mirono escooters: Bwah
[2023-08-06T01:28:57] Mirono escooters: A go-kart maybe
[2023-08-06T01:29:31] Oreo huzky: These things
[2023-08-06T01:31:02] Oreo huzky: Make go cart with four of these üíÄ
[2023-08-06T01:38:03] Face de Pin Suc√©: No please don't haha
[2023-08-06T01:39:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: Flipsky is 6x470
[2023-08-06T02:02:46] Happy Giraffe: Its gonna rip the frame in half if you dont reinforce it with long steel torque armsüòÇ
[2023-08-06T02:04:30] Happy Giraffe: Later I might be able to produce torque arms for you from stainless or acid resistance steelüòÅ
[2023-08-06T02:32:05] Nick: No I meant a matching front wheel as in the size not motor
[2023-08-06T02:55:39] Happy Giraffe: Sometimes bikes have larger front wheels in enduro etc but on street might be good idea to have same size
[2023-08-06T02:55:45] Happy Giraffe: Or even smaller idk
[2023-08-06T02:56:32] Nick: I did consider getting a larger front and keeping a small rear but it only works aesthetically if the rear is wide like a chopper
[2023-08-06T03:11:26] Happy Giraffe: Small rear wheel helps with torque
[2023-08-06T03:50:11] Happy Giraffe: Fuck, in France ebike tuning can get you 30'000‚Ç¨ fine. Vesc profile handy again (saved me from cops once alreadyüòÅ)
[2023-08-06T03:50:49] Happy Giraffe: Is there an easy board where you can toggle your adc2 input to be brake and throttle?üòÅ
[2023-08-06T03:51:06] Happy Giraffe: Yes, some news article on that lol
[2023-08-06T03:51:43] Happy Giraffe: https://ebike-mtb.com/en/france-bans-illegal-emtb-tuning/
[2023-08-06T03:52:33] Happy Giraffe: 2020 but still, a year in prison and 30k fine lmao. Its worse than you rape someone violently or kill a person in traffic here in Finlandüôà
[2023-08-06T04:13:27] Happy Giraffe: Btw, you heard of Grin cycle analyst v3?
[2023-08-06T04:15:26] Happy Giraffe: That thing can control all the throttles etc output to any esc. Having a button on handlebar for cruise control with pedal sensor would be insaneüòÅ Also other cool things like combining throttle cutoff and regen etc.
[2023-08-06T04:18:10] Happy Giraffe: https://ebikes.ca/product-info/grin-products/cycle-analyst-3.html Screen looks like its from 2002, atleast wont consume powerüòÇ
[2023-08-06T04:25:45] Happy Giraffe: But kind of sexy in retro way, does vesc have any option to add auxiliary buttons? Like a cruise control?
[2023-08-06T04:26:50] Happy Giraffe: Then I could pedal lightly, tap cruise and then have constantly the power I want until I tap ebrake or cruise button againü§î
[2023-08-06T04:29:02] Happy Giraffe: Switch like this wired straight to throttle input?üòÇ
[2023-08-06T04:44:18] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, it would need to stay on even when throttle activates again as its my torque sensor giving adc1. Otherwise it would need to override throttle
[2023-08-06T04:46:58] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_9228@06-08-2023_04-46-58.jpg>
[2023-08-06T05:03:48] Happy Giraffe: But this won't tell me how TX needs to be wiredüòÅ
[2023-08-06T06:11:13] Rogerio Figueiredo: Hello my friend anyone with 75300_v2 Allu pcb and vsett motor?
[2023-08-06T09:17:39] Gabe Enzo: üëÄ
[2023-08-06T09:19:16] Gabe Enzo: 60KW 550a 24s lol
[2023-08-06T11:02:33] Nick: That thing needs some sort of steering dampener that looked so twitchy but I want one
[2023-08-06T11:04:36] Nick: Question. For most of my power related stuff is 8awg enough?
[2023-08-06T11:12:43] Nick: Also is there any brands other than spintend that'd work? It's a pain trying to pay them without PayPal
[2023-08-06T11:13:06] Nick: For 72v controller and a 12v adapter
[2023-08-06T11:14:19] Mirono escooters: Flipsky, makerx, trampa
[2023-08-06T11:15:53] Nick: I did a flipsky on my meepo but when I built that one everyone in the meepo chat said they were unreliable. Are they better nowadays? That was like 4 yrs ago
[2023-08-06T11:17:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: For what vehicle do you need a VESC?
[2023-08-06T11:17:37] Nick: It's uh.. an ebike
[2023-08-06T11:17:45] Nick: <photos/photo_9229@06-08-2023_11-17-45.jpg>
[2023-08-06T11:18:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: What power are you looking to ?
[2023-08-06T11:18:48] Nick: 3kw motor, I'd like to have 72v setup since the battery will be 72v
[2023-08-06T11:19:03] Nick: Eventually tho motor is being upgraded
[2023-08-06T11:19:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: Then go for C350
[2023-08-06T11:20:28] Nick: Kk. 20s7p is battery spec btw
[2023-08-06T11:21:06] Nick: The only thing I'm not sure about is the c350 Is nearly double the price of the other controllers I'm looking at
[2023-08-06T11:21:49] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, but it will handle the power, in long use too
[2023-08-06T11:22:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: You could also go for a Tronic 250
[2023-08-06T11:22:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: But, Tronic.. ü§£
[2023-08-06T11:22:18] Nick: Does c350 have 12v ADC built in?
[2023-08-06T11:22:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: 12V3A yes
[2023-08-06T11:22:58] Nick: What's a tronic 250m
[2023-08-06T11:23:01] Nick: ?
[2023-08-06T11:24:02] Nick: Specs look like it'd work do they have any known issues?
[2023-08-06T11:24:20] Nick: Also I like that it's blue, not that I'd buy it because of that
[2023-08-06T11:24:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: If you match the max specs, it's not reliable
[2023-08-06T11:25:28] Unknown: raga the spinted 75v 200a holds the 72v ?
[2023-08-06T11:25:44] Nick: I probably won't be putting as much as it's rated flr
[2023-08-06T11:25:50] Nick: Single 3kw motor
[2023-08-06T11:26:45] Rogerio Figueiredo: Any one?
[2023-08-06T11:27:38] Rogerio Figueiredo: I have setup without halls (sensorless) before I had exact same controller and same motor no problem
[2023-08-06T11:30:05] Unknown: you can help me?
[2023-08-06T11:30:10] Rogerio Figueiredo: I did reset no luck tried a 6.00 now hw limits and a 6.02 no luck either way
[2023-08-06T11:35:43] Rogerio Figueiredo: Any idea?
[2023-08-06T11:36:07] Rogerio Figueiredo: I did reset settings the same motor and same controller worked good before
[2023-08-06T11:37:18] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is a 75100 V2 allu pcb makerbase
[2023-08-06T11:37:31] Rogerio Figueiredo: I used this esc for 6 months now without problem
[2023-08-06T12:00:14] Happy Giraffe: So what exactly is the problem?
[2023-08-06T12:03:36] Rogerio Figueiredo: Choking
[2023-08-06T12:03:58] Rogerio Figueiredo: When hit full throttle start to shoke
[2023-08-06T12:07:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: not only emtb, but escooters too (law was modified to include escooters)
[2023-08-06T12:08:38] Mirono escooters: Heh
[2023-08-06T12:08:42] Mirono escooters: God forbid we have fun
[2023-08-06T12:10:09] puneDir: What the hell
[2023-08-06T12:15:00] Rogerio Figueiredo: France sucks
[2023-08-06T12:15:28] Mirono escooters: Germany even more
[2023-08-06T12:15:39] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yes come to üáµüáπ
[2023-08-06T12:16:06] Mirono escooters: Have sun?
[2023-08-06T12:17:24] AK: All the people complaining about strict regulation on tuning should enjoy countries with little to no legislation
[2023-08-06T12:17:58] AK: Enjoy having your grandma killed by a clown doing 80 in pedestrian zone on his kaboo asstis
[2023-08-06T12:18:45] Mirono escooters: That's just called being not a absolute moron
[2023-08-06T12:18:53] Mirono escooters: If all people would just have a lil brain that they'd use, they wouldn't ruin it for the rest of us
[2023-08-06T12:19:00] AK: And that is what the law is for, making it hard for morons
[2023-08-06T12:19:08] Mirono escooters: But ofcourse, 1 bad apple spoils the batch
[2023-08-06T12:19:12] Mirono escooters: But morons don't follow the law
[2023-08-06T12:19:14] Mirono escooters: That's the problem
[2023-08-06T12:19:21] AK: Exactly the same reason why T√ºv exists, and there are zero trucks with failing brakes in germany
[2023-08-06T12:19:28] AK: But one a second in russia and china
[2023-08-06T12:19:29] Mirono escooters: I'll just move to a forest in sweden and spend my days there
[2023-08-06T12:19:52] AK: What is lacking is legislation for street legal tuning, and clear procedures on those
[2023-08-06T12:20:10] AK: We'll have to wait a couple of more years for that to appear
[2023-08-06T12:20:21] Mirono escooters: Cars can go past 110kmh, and everyone is ok with it But God forbid a scooter CAN do it
[2023-08-06T12:20:40] Mirono escooters: We should all ban cars, it would be a much safer worldüëç

[2023-08-06T12:20:55] AK: Yeah, because stepping your foot in a car without drivers license, which takes half a year to do, and a lot of effort literally gets you prison sentence
[2023-08-06T12:21:09] AK: and most likely life long prohibition on car driving
[2023-08-06T12:21:15] Mirono escooters: Enough morons speed. Don't act like they dont
[2023-08-06T12:21:22] AK: And for scoots you literally have to be 14, that's it
[2023-08-06T12:21:27] Mirono escooters: Even my parents know the speed limit cams and drive between em faster
[2023-08-06T12:21:37] Mirono escooters: 16 in Belgium, and soon insurance üëç
[2023-08-06T12:21:41] AK: Don't act like cars don't have harsher punishment and control on tuning and breaking laws
[2023-08-06T12:21:46] Mirono escooters: They need money. The pricks
[2023-08-06T12:22:02] Mirono escooters: Negative
[2023-08-06T12:22:05] AK: Best thing to ever happen, mandatory insurance, would approve that on bikes
[2023-08-06T12:22:19] AK: Good luck having a crash involving a bike
[2023-08-06T12:22:29] Mirono escooters: God forbid a 2 ton vehicle can't be tuned? Makes sense. Compared to a 50kg piece of metal
[2023-08-06T12:22:41] Mirono escooters: Jeez
[2023-08-06T12:22:42] AK: Whatever, this is the wrong group and the wrong age group for meaningful discussion on that topic
[2023-08-06T12:22:46] Mirono escooters: Yah
[2023-08-06T12:22:51] Mirono escooters: We aren't getting to a point anyway
[2023-08-06T12:23:14] Mirono escooters: It's good enough I already have to pay to live here, pay to ride my moped, and pay to ride a ebike
[2023-08-06T12:23:24] Mirono escooters: I'm not a chicken to be plucked dry
[2023-08-06T12:26:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes but they‚Äôve different specs, not same ripple current and ers
[2023-08-06T12:27:59] Mirono escooters: Comparing apples to pears
[2023-08-06T12:34:39] Happy Giraffe: Damn, how you guys then live with those cops?
[2023-08-06T12:35:08] Gabe Enzo: If the wire is short, yes.
[2023-08-06T12:35:15] Gabe Enzo: Awg is useless if you don't specify length
[2023-08-06T12:35:27] Gabe Enzo: and runtime and peaks
[2023-08-06T12:35:33] Unknown: üôèüôè
[2023-08-06T12:35:42] Happy Giraffe: This sadly is the other end, however in Finland even a moto cop said to a 50cc biker: "I dont care if you have 400,000hp in your engine if you ride nicely"üòÇ
[2023-08-06T12:49:50] Gabe Enzo: Yes cause they have to have blanket rules. The max speed is 40kmh in 40kmh zones cause most sub 100iq ppl can't calculate normally
[2023-08-06T12:49:58] Gabe Enzo: Its awful
[2023-08-06T12:50:19] Gabe Enzo: its like morons who drive Escooters and crash into people and cars and get ppl hurt and then they become illegal
[2023-08-06T12:51:11] Gabe Enzo: There should be an Escooter / ebike license.
[2023-08-06T12:51:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: when they are not ordered with escooter control missions, they are pretty chill about escooters.
[2023-08-06T12:52:57] Gabe Enzo: and all commercial E Mopeds should be fitted with indicators by law.
[2023-08-06T12:53:17] Gabe Enzo: yeah here It depends on the county.
[2023-08-06T13:02:54] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, witnessed chill cops in denmark too. Until a cop came with portable dynometerüòÇ
[2023-08-06T13:35:36] Mirono escooters: I can get into that
[2023-08-06T13:35:50] Mirono escooters: Ride nicely and it's ok
[2023-08-06T13:47:52] Gabe Enzo: People ride Escooters without even knowing the physics mathematics aspect of moving and velocity
[2023-08-06T13:48:10] Gabe Enzo: They think they can like do a sharp turn and like actually make it
[2023-08-06T13:48:25] Gabe Enzo: or that they don't need to shift their weight when doing acrobatic jumps.
[2023-08-06T13:48:30] Gabe Enzo: Literally retarded
[2023-08-06T13:48:52] Gabe Enzo: They can't even do that
[2023-08-06T13:55:05] Mirono escooters: "Inertia? What animal is that"
[2023-08-06T14:21:53] Unknown: Zero11x can go above 140 (mu friend's does (upgraded))
[2023-08-06T14:23:07] Mirono escooters: Missed my point
[2023-08-06T14:24:50] Unknown: That it shouldn't do that ?
[2023-08-06T14:25:17] Mirono escooters: No. That cars can do it, but everyone trusts the rider to ride within speed limits But scooters can't go over 25 or they get confiscated
[2023-08-06T14:25:40] Unknown: Let's say the fastest he could hold it 140 the controller can go above
[2023-08-06T14:25:56] Unknown: Not in here (yet)
[2023-08-06T14:27:44] Unknown: But it is the limit yes and it is ridiculous you are also aren't allowed to drive on the concrete only on road
[2023-08-06T14:28:08] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-08-06T14:52:42] Lutz: <photos/photo_9230@06-08-2023_14-52-42.jpg>
[2023-08-06T15:13:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is this resin pcb?
[2023-08-06T15:18:52] Lutz: alu pcb
[2023-08-06T15:19:07] Lutz: one sided, thats why 16mm2 busbars are needed
[2023-08-06T15:20:23] Face de Pin Suc√©: If you need some beta testers, I'm always happy to burn some frames :)
[2023-08-06T15:23:42] Lutz: Aluminium PCB sits directly on water canels ;-)
[2023-08-06T15:24:15] Finn: And you think that it will not corrode or anything?
[2023-08-06T15:24:18] Face de Pin Suc√©: I wouldn't do that x)
[2023-08-06T15:25:10] Lutz: 2mm thick aluminum, of course i use corrosion inhibitors like on normal aluminum engines too ;)
[2023-08-06T15:25:39] Lutz: i could put an additional alu plate in between, but what should it help
[2023-08-06T15:25:42] Finn: What about adding fins for the water to pass through
[2023-08-06T15:26:00] Face de Pin Suc√©: better for the dismount possibilities, always better
[2023-08-06T15:26:09] Lutz: complicating the canels is possible
[2023-08-06T15:26:47] Lutz: why would u dismount the powerstage? when its broken?
[2023-08-06T15:27:19] Face de Pin Suc√©: when broken for example, or putting on another radiator type
[2023-08-06T15:28:03] Lutz: ? that's one design that fits together u could still mount the aluminum block to something else and dont use water cooling
[2023-08-06T15:28:38] Lutz: but then its hard to push around 400phase amps per Stage ;)
[2023-08-06T15:28:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: heat would'nt transfer well to the external aluminum block because of the void and big thermal inertia
[2023-08-06T15:29:11] Mirono escooters: So much quickconnectors xD
[2023-08-06T15:29:45] Lutz: to connection is still good with 2mm alu pcb
[2023-08-06T15:30:34] Lutz: its enough space to put another 2mm aluminum plate, when someone is worried
[2023-08-06T15:31:36] Lutz: 3 time xt90, for 270A from battery and 380a phase amps, so i thought it's ok and enough for up to 120v ;o
[2023-08-06T15:32:29] Lutz: it's designed for two mirrored Power stages, so max would be like 24s 96v * 760 phase amps
[2023-08-06T15:33:31] Lutz: yup already building
[2023-08-06T15:33:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: you plan to use 1 STM for 2 powerstages ? Like focbox or stormcore ?
[2023-08-06T15:34:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: oh sorry, misread
[2023-08-06T15:34:09] Lutz: no its mirrored
[2023-08-06T15:34:17] Lutz: same connections
[2023-08-06T15:36:19] Lutz: i mean u could also use two controllers with an insulator in between and connect both via CAN
[2023-08-06T15:36:46] Face de Pin Suc√©: From what I've heard it's a pain in the ass to develop and make it work perfectly
[2023-08-06T15:41:20] Lutz: outer side of controller board is nothing populated, but will switch from nrf52 to esp for vesc express on board
[2023-08-06T15:43:20] Lutz: <photos/photo_9233@06-08-2023_15-43-20.jpg>
[2023-08-06T15:43:28] Lutz: right one is original 75/300
[2023-08-06T15:44:31] Lutz: 160x105x25
[2023-08-06T15:45:33] Lutz: or 50 two stages mirrored, 51 with two controllers for dual
[2023-08-06T15:47:33] Lutz: i think the 7mm is worth the integrated water-cooling:))
[2023-08-06T15:48:19] Lutz: and also vesc adds still xt90 connectors, so this saves also space and cables are shorter
[2023-08-06T15:48:40] Lutz: well it adds mass for heat spreading also
[2023-08-06T15:49:30] Lutz: everything is reachable from both sides
[2023-08-06T15:49:45] Lutz: outside is covered with soldermask just
[2023-08-06T15:50:39] Lutz: so its not plug and play, but this stuff is more serious with max 120v, so dont like anything not soldered
[2023-08-06T15:50:59] Lutz: not possible
[2023-08-06T15:51:18] Lutz: i have clearances for higher voltage
[2023-08-06T15:52:05] Lutz: exactly u need that for being able to mirror power stages
[2023-08-06T15:52:11] Lutz: everything is up to 120v
[2023-08-06T15:52:30] Lutz: even phase shunts with ina241
[2023-08-06T15:53:06] Lutz: so nice FOC up to 96v 24S
[2023-08-06T15:53:17] Lutz: hehe
[2023-08-06T15:53:37] Lutz: well design allows for big tvs
[2023-08-06T15:54:47] Lutz: but for boat outboard i will also try 26S
[2023-08-06T15:55:07] Lutz: yes exactly
[2023-08-06T15:57:56] Lutz: i also add resolver interface, really fan of Hyundai HSGs
[2023-08-06T16:00:45] Lutz: hybrid starter generator, they are cheapest watercooled BLDC motos available
[2023-08-06T16:01:06] Lutz: 15kw motor watercooled for 100eur ;)
[2023-08-06T16:01:50] Lutz: <photos/photo_9234@06-08-2023_16-01-50.jpg>
[2023-08-06T16:02:10] Lutz: yup fits nicely
[2023-08-06T16:03:13] Lutz: just 100A but its ok at 96v
[2023-08-06T16:03:22] Lutz: they usually run higher voltage
[2023-08-06T16:04:25] Lutz: Max 100A
[2023-08-06T16:04:35] Lutz: i wouldn't push it much higher
[2023-08-06T16:05:42] Lutz: <photos/photo_9235@06-08-2023_16-05-42.jpg>
[2023-08-06T16:06:25] Lutz: they have low kv rating and not soo thick copper
[2023-08-06T16:11:29] Lutz: one or single stages
[2023-08-06T16:17:15] Lutz: i sold so far few prototypes fully assembled for 500 with two stages. not even watercooled. of course it will go down when i ramp it up and let do some work someone else. but i dont rush
[2023-08-06T16:18:12] Lutz: i only made not watercooled version
[2023-08-06T16:18:41] Lutz: but we needed to add custom copper busbars, so tuned Layout now to avoid that
[2023-08-06T16:19:06] Lutz: not watercooled will reach 20mm with 18mm diameter caps
[2023-08-06T16:21:20] Lutz: with different caps we could reduce the height further, but dont wanna use cheap caps
[2023-08-06T16:33:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: Pcb‚Äôs alu isn‚Äôt anticorrodal
[2023-08-06T16:33:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Normal alu for water cooling is normally 6061 anticorrodal
[2023-08-06T16:33:58] Finn: 2mm alu plate from above and put in fins then screw the alupcb onto the plate
[2023-08-06T16:34:57] Lutz: i dont plan to use saltwater as cooling agent üòÅ
[2023-08-06T16:37:47] Lutz: u can get anodized aluminum pcbs
[2023-08-06T16:40:47] Lutz: 6061 is also available
[2023-08-06T16:44:01] KierreKikkeli: cancelled the order and have been thinking maybe ill order the 100A version after all, dont need a 200A with vsett 10+ do i? And prob wont be getting anything faster than that for a looong time xd
[2023-08-06T16:48:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt recommend the useless fuse
[2023-08-06T16:49:14] KierreKikkeli: even tho it might be in daily use for years? with a probable 13-14s onto a vsett 10+?
[2023-08-06T16:49:30] Mirono escooters: More better
[2023-08-06T16:49:33] Mirono escooters: Margin, less heat
[2023-08-06T16:49:58] KierreKikkeli: true true
[2023-08-06T16:50:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: 200a version don‚Äôt have diode ü•≤
[2023-08-06T16:53:54] Mirono escooters: Wha, why
[2023-08-06T17:26:02] KierreKikkeli: thats what i was thinking ü§î
[2023-08-06T18:11:31] Unknown: Brake light 75200 is there a way without the e wheel adapter ?
[2023-08-06T18:18:06] Mirono escooters: Directly wiring it to brake sensor?
[2023-08-06T22:22:26] Rogerio Figueiredo: Need dine rood guys
[2023-08-06T22:27:00] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is possible to set vsett motor without hiccups
[2023-08-06T22:31:03] Mirono escooters: Start using Ortega original and backemf enabled
[2023-08-06T22:36:59] Rogerio Figueiredo: What is max phase you use?
[2023-08-06T22:37:15] Rogerio Figueiredo: I made a test with 180a phase and 60a battery
[2023-08-06T22:37:27] Rogerio Figueiredo: With 22s
[2023-08-06T22:37:35] Rogerio Figueiredo: Reach 89gps
[2023-08-06T22:51:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: Now same hardware is chocking
[2023-08-06T22:51:43] Rogerio Figueiredo: Hiccups don't now why
[2023-08-06T23:30:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: Makerbase 75100
[2023-08-06T23:30:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: 22s 60a is possible
[2023-08-06T23:30:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yup
[2023-08-06T23:30:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Depends by motor
[2023-08-06T23:30:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: If monorim motor I don‚Äôt trust honestly
[2023-08-06T23:30:53] Rogerio Figueiredo: But I have exactly same hardware without problems
[2023-08-06T23:31:08] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is vsett
[2023-08-06T23:31:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: Single?
[2023-08-06T23:31:53] Rogerio Figueiredo: <video_file>
[2023-08-06T23:32:08] Rogerio Figueiredo: Same exactly hardware
[2023-08-06T23:32:31] Rogerio Figueiredo: Not equal is rlly the same
[2023-08-06T23:34:49] Rogerio Figueiredo: I just tried another motor then get back to this one
[2023-08-06T23:34:56] Rogerio Figueiredo: I dos a reset
[2023-08-06T23:35:28] Rogerio Figueiredo: Install version 6.00 again no luck
[2023-08-06T23:40:19] Rogerio Figueiredo: All stock
[2023-08-06T23:40:30] Rogerio Figueiredo: Let me get to scooter an I show you
[2023-08-06T23:40:46] Rogerio Figueiredo: I only use the 40a field weakening
[2023-08-06T23:43:14] Rogerio Figueiredo: Nothing else
[2023-08-06T23:43:24] Rogerio Figueiredo: Stock sensorless settings
[2023-08-07T01:13:11] Rogerio Figueiredo: Let me try now and I Teel you
[2023-08-07T01:13:17] Rogerio Figueiredo: @jamessoderstrom thank you

[2023-08-07T02:22:00] Rogerio Figueiredo: But is not unlimited
[2023-08-07T02:24:05] Rogerio Figueiredo: I can't install no hw limits on android and I can't install beta on my Mac
[2023-08-07T02:28:30] Rogerio Figueiredo: The seam to work what do they do?
[2023-08-07T04:13:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: I don't
[2023-08-07T04:14:00] Rogerio Figueiredo: I want to try the new screen features that @kawaiinekololis developed
[2023-08-07T06:21:57] Simone: why they don't use the Foc detect paramaters ?

[2023-08-07T08:08:01] Unknown: hello, this vesc how are they warm?
[2023-08-07T09:00:05] Nick: Worth a few bucks or nah
[2023-08-07T09:01:01] Nick: And is it necessary?
[2023-08-07T09:02:57] Mirono escooters: I don't see the point
[2023-08-07T09:08:58] Nick: I told her I would use 8mm bullets and she recommended kt
[2023-08-07T09:26:26] Nick: I'll say no worst case I can hack together one by myself
[2023-08-07T10:26:44] Unknown: Whare do I get power from ?

[2023-08-07T12:47:30] Mirono escooters: The brake signal switches a relay
[2023-08-07T13:18:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: PM
[2023-08-07T15:45:18] Awyba: but only with modification right?
[2023-08-07T15:46:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: No, just a bit of field weakening and it‚Äôs ok
[2023-08-07T16:00:37] Awyba: but isnt it only rated for 20s?
[2023-08-07T16:20:57] Nick: If I wanted 2 MFD instead of the analog dash would 2 davegas work on the Spintend I ordered? I want speedometer on the left and a combo of batt voltage and the motor output on the right screen but idk if there's something better to do it
[2023-08-07T18:35:21] Unknown: I don't understand I'm taking it to a shop and they are saying I can't get lights on brakes if I don't have the eweel adapter
[2023-08-07T19:00:00] sombre_enfant: They died again after one wheel turn
[2023-08-07T19:00:48] Happy Giraffe: Phone is perfect vesc displayüòÅ gives you most info in one screen. Only have to swipe once for batt info
[2023-08-07T19:01:52] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No, it's fine, I used 22s 85A just fine with 75100.
[2023-08-07T19:07:30] Oreo huzky: What if backemf
[2023-08-07T19:09:16] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: nope, it was fine, used with field weakening etc
[2023-08-07T19:18:36] Oreo huzky: What about temps?
[2023-08-07T19:45:05] gil guy: Voltage generated by motor while turning . increase with speed . so max pulse phase current is (Vbat-Vbemf)/Rwinding . it decrease with speed..
[2023-08-07T20:31:41] Mirono escooters: Bruh
[2023-08-07T20:39:33] Rogerio Figueiredo: The detection shouldn't work when so setup motor?
[2023-08-07T20:40:38] Unknown: Expoand
[2023-08-07T20:42:04] Rogerio Figueiredo: <video_file>
[2023-08-07T20:42:14] Rogerio Figueiredo: Could this be to bad bearings?
[2023-08-07T20:42:28] Rogerio Figueiredo: All is tight
[2023-08-07T20:42:50] Rogerio Figueiredo: I install the tire again and still does this
[2023-08-07T20:44:02] Simone: no
[2023-08-07T21:56:20] Chen Simhony: hey i know there was someone that install 75100 dual on xiaomi pro and he fold the capacitors find the pics anyone know who it is ?
[2023-08-07T22:33:33] Martin Kaktits: is it split rim? Cold be closed improperly
[2023-08-07T22:34:23] Rogerio Figueiredo: It is split rim yes
[2023-08-07T22:34:49] Rogerio Figueiredo: But is very well closed since I open a close again
[2023-08-07T22:35:10] Rogerio Figueiredo: And disc has nothing to do with tge split rim right?
[2023-08-07T22:35:21] Martin Kaktits: oh. right
[2023-08-07T22:35:42] Rogerio Figueiredo: The xiaomi is to small for dual on my opinion
[2023-08-07T22:35:52] Rogerio Figueiredo: Go single
[2023-08-07T22:36:20] Chen Simhony: 2 singles?
[2023-08-08T05:37:14] Happy Giraffe: Owner of the group had Spintend dual vesc on Xiaomi ProüòÅ
[2023-08-08T05:38:09] Happy Giraffe: Ofcourse this limits battery space inside so you gotta mount an external bag/case
[2023-08-08T06:11:59] Gabe Enzo: Only reason to get a G30 frame is this reason.
[2023-08-08T06:50:15] Happy Giraffe: Overall I heard its more stable and sturdy
[2023-08-08T06:52:00] Gabe Enzo: I drove a G30 before my buddy sold it to get a kugoo. I felt no difference in stability.
[2023-08-08T06:52:06] Gabe Enzo: it did feel a bit more chunkier I may add.
[2023-08-08T06:52:15] Gabe Enzo: To be honest, kinda uncomfortable.
[2023-08-08T06:52:23] Gabe Enzo: But that doesn't mean it's worse, it takes getting used to
[2023-08-08T06:53:08] Gabe Enzo: The 10 inch pneumatic wheels made it nicer. That is a fact.
[2023-08-08T06:53:38] Gabe Enzo: It may give the illusion of it being more stable as virtually nobody drives 10inch with pro 2 frames except enthusiasts. so g30 users who test drive 8.5" xiaomis are turned off by it
[2023-08-08T10:08:59] Nick: Looking for a good setup for gauge cluster and security is there any common things that'd stand up to basic motorcycle thieves these days? Preferably something kinda intended to plug into a Spintend or vesc in general
[2023-08-08T10:29:11] Happy Giraffe: 10mm hardened steel chain. If you have expensive moto then 12mm hardened chain lock
[2023-08-08T10:29:29] Happy Giraffe: That coupled with a gps tracker or airtag
[2023-08-08T10:30:50] Nick: Would a kryptonite work? Problem last time is they had a angle grinder so they cut it and presumably just rolled the scooter away. I want to booby trap it maybe make it very loudly say "insert keycard" and use a little key wjth NFC chip or something to turn it on
[2023-08-08T10:31:54] Nick: That was my old vsett 10 that got stolen
[2023-08-08T10:31:57] Pablo Fernandez: if they got time/people dont give a fuck they will take it no matter what you do
[2023-08-08T10:33:02] Pablo Fernandez: on one of my vsetts im trying to install a proximity sensor on the handlebar but still on early stages (for speed limiting and turning on) however they can always roll it away if im not there to see it
[2023-08-08T10:33:11] Nick: Yeah I plan on parking it in front of our doors so security can see it but I kinda want key with NFC built in, a loud narrator to say "insert key" if you even slightly touch the bike and make it move, and I'll chain it around a light post.
[2023-08-08T10:34:03] Nick: I think they just disassembled it the actual scooter or angle ground the little footrest on the vsett that I was looping the kryptonite thru
[2023-08-08T10:34:35] Nick: This whole thing was the reason I'm starting this build tbh. A giant middle finger to the thieves and the bike is gonna be black and yellow too
[2023-08-08T10:35:34] Pablo Fernandez: my main issue here is getting stolen while riding or walking with it, i wont even take the inmotion out until i figure out a locking system
[2023-08-08T10:35:56] Pablo Fernandez: because the gt2 and nami at least got nfc
[2023-08-08T10:37:43] Happy Giraffe: Nah, key switch is good to get drunks/kids away from turning all the switches. Good lock, tracker and insurance. That will be enough. If a seasoned thief wants anything, they will sadly take it. Also the location where you leave it matters.
[2023-08-08T10:38:03] Happy Giraffe: While riding?
[2023-08-08T10:38:09] Happy Giraffe: Stolen at gunpoint?üòÖ
[2023-08-08T10:38:43] Pablo Fernandez: you get pushed on bike lanes, or streets, here in seville (spain) roads are tight
[2023-08-08T10:39:35] Happy Giraffe: Wow, thats wild
[2023-08-08T10:40:47] Nick: Start swinging a kryptonite around like a morningstar
[2023-08-08T10:41:06] Pablo Fernandez: without being racist and offensive eventhought it sounds like, we are getting lot of moroccan thefts lately and they get no punishment or any consecuences sadly
[2023-08-08T10:41:35] Pablo Fernandez: having a family filled with lawyers all the time is the same
[2023-08-08T10:42:32] Nick: If I buy a phone plan for it is it possible to just make the vesc call the police and give the GPS address and a notification saying it's being stolen
[2023-08-08T10:43:07] Pablo Fernandez: you could hide a gps and only enable the sim tracking if it gets stolen
[2023-08-08T10:44:07] Pablo Fernandez: on a kart i got it on the wheel but on escooter you must be careful where you put it
[2023-08-08T11:28:08] Happy Giraffe: Just get insurance for it. I have it in my apartments insurance as add-on. If a toxicated guy burns my bike down I have to pay 150‚Ç¨ and get the full coverage
[2023-08-08T11:44:57] Gabe Enzo: 150 for 2000 worth of electronics is very good.
[2023-08-08T11:45:02] Gabe Enzo: üëÄ
[2023-08-08T11:45:14] Gabe Enzo: Here in Ireland they don't let us get insurance .

[2023-08-08T11:50:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: <video_file>
[2023-08-08T11:52:23] AK: Sim is like 2 eur a month
[2023-08-08T11:53:21] AK: 99,9% insurances for bike etc theft compensate based on remaining value, and for escoots it's usually 3 years
[2023-08-08T11:53:42] AK: So that means if it's 1 year old, you get 66% of initial pricing back
[2023-08-08T11:54:00] AK: Sorry on the wording, english finance speak is not my usual field of expertise
[2023-08-08T11:59:48] Happy Giraffe: For me its only 10% yearly value lost. But if a theft happens, only then we know the reality how things go. Insurance companies are a scam

[2023-08-08T12:00:49] AK: 10% is a very good deal tbh
[2023-08-08T12:01:47] Happy Giraffe: Yeah its one of the older banks in Finland which also the government uses
[2023-08-08T12:15:20] Nick: Yeah I'm definitely getting renters insurance soon and getting full coverage for all my PEVs. I just would hate to make this bike as a labor of love and then have it taken because id have to build another one.
[2023-08-08T12:40:30] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, modern society gives criminals more rights than us so best is avoid getting things stolen. Insurance just a last stand
[2023-08-08T13:13:33] Mirono escooters: How much without caps
[2023-08-08T13:13:55] Mirono escooters: Legal scam
[2023-08-08T13:18:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: 28mm, because of connector
[2023-08-08T14:07:57] Jan: Ok thank you for measuring
[2023-08-08T14:08:45] Face de Pin Suc√©: 28mm is too much for you ?
[2023-08-08T14:16:20] Jan: Its very much on the limit

[2023-08-08T17:32:49] HTTP(s) Boost: Pls tell it to this pal with his humble Nucular 24F, 300a batt/500a phase @ 72v
[2023-08-08T17:48:11] Oreo huzky: The motors look kinda strange
[2023-08-08T17:59:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs the most powerful for e scooter
[2023-08-08T17:59:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs way bigger than Huameng 8000w 95mm statorüòÇüòÇ
[2023-08-08T18:03:18] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes but too big, it's 7inch rim, they made a CST with 7inch, but shit tyre and having too small side tyres is not good for cornering :/
[2023-08-08T18:03:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: That's why we don't go for it
[2023-08-08T18:03:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: But for drag race it's very nice
[2023-08-08T18:09:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: There‚Äôs even 115mm motor
[2023-08-08T18:10:15] KierreKikkeli: is this all i need for the stock esc->vesc upgrade?
[2023-08-08T18:10:47] KierreKikkeli: have a vsett 10+ already, just need a proper battery for it as rn i only have an external 20A 12s
[2023-08-08T18:10:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: I know
[2023-08-08T18:24:01] Mike: Hello, I've had the problem for a long time. When I brake and slowly come to a standstill, I notice that the engine stutters. Then it sounds like a crack. What can that be?
[2023-08-08T18:39:54] Thierry: This is ubox 200A
[2023-08-08T18:41:00] Mirono escooters: Delete connectors= save 2-3mm lol
[2023-08-08T18:47:15] Thierry: There is more for capa so 23.5mm, sorry üòÖ
[2023-08-08T18:52:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: yes ubox 200A is very thin, but too large
[2023-08-08T18:56:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: Dis equipe already new suce mosfet?
[2023-08-08T19:00:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: Nope, this is sample before production
[2023-08-08T19:00:35] Jason Nelson: When I let off the throttle the ebrake engages hard, can someone tell me how to only engage the electronic brake when I'm pulling on my brake lever?
[2023-08-08T19:12:20] Jan: Its almost perfect but too long üòÖ
[2023-08-08T19:13:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: There‚Äôs many possibilities, but please don‚Äôt use tronic anymore a ahahah ah, one of these mosfet has double of tronic mosfet powerüòÅ
[2023-08-08T19:14:32] Jan: We have like 3x left to blow up
[2023-08-08T19:15:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: Why you need blow up them? Just sell and get good vesc ‚Ä¶.
[2023-08-08T19:15:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: He needs to go to 3Shul, never get back after that amount of real power haha
[2023-08-08T19:16:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs too high for me, otherwise I go them. I use flipsky because they are just 13mm the highest point hahaha
[2023-08-08T19:16:29] Face de Pin Suc√©: üòÇ
[2023-08-08T19:18:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs shit yeah, but if you use them rightly they are very powerful for its size
[2023-08-08T19:27:03] Oreo huzky: What kv?
[2023-08-08T19:29:29] Oreo huzky: I thought stator is 75mm?
[2023-08-08T19:36:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: You mean length or width
[2023-08-08T19:38:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: Huameng has very small diameter
[2023-08-08T19:39:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs more a toy üòÇ
[2023-08-08T21:18:08] Martin Kaktits: Is it possible to corrent a tire thats slightly out of shape? Like, a little oval.
[2023-08-08T21:18:36] Mirono escooters: Burnout üòé
[2023-08-08T21:34:07] Martin Kaktits: its more like the inner diameter not round
[2023-08-08T22:22:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: 75100
[2023-08-08T22:56:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: It can handle 250A
[2023-08-08T22:56:38] Oreo huzky: Idk
[2023-08-08T23:13:47] Oreo huzky: Magnet length
[2023-08-08T23:14:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: 70mm is the max they made üòÇ
[2023-08-08T23:14:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: But the stator is only 100mm
[2023-08-08T23:14:29] Oreo huzky: That‚Äôs magnet width
[2023-08-08T23:14:47] Oreo huzky: I mesured 75mm
[2023-08-08T23:15:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_9258@08-08-2023_23-15-00.jpg>
[2023-08-08T23:15:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: You measured stator or magnet? Because magnet is max 70mm
[2023-08-08T23:15:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: I know the guy, he is just 100km from me
[2023-08-08T23:15:47] Oreo huzky: Magnet
[2023-08-08T23:15:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Max is 70mm
[2023-08-08T23:16:20] Oreo huzky: Idk maybe I hold the measuring tape kinda wonky
[2023-08-08T23:17:30] Oreo huzky: Is it the vesc I used or the motor because I have stutter under load at like 150A phase
[2023-08-08T23:18:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: Bro I know this motor
[2023-08-08T23:18:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: The stator is so small
[2023-08-08T23:18:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because their factory use machine for wind motors
[2023-08-08T23:19:06] Oreo huzky: And that means?
[2023-08-08T23:19:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: Longyu factory hand made winding
[2023-08-08T23:19:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: They can fit more copper
[2023-08-08T23:19:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: Bigger stator more power and torque
[2023-08-08T23:20:06] Oreo huzky: What‚Äôs the max amps that I can do with this because the vesc can‚Äôt be the problem now I upgraded to cl350
[2023-08-08T23:21:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt recommend to exceed 140 battery and 300 phase
[2023-08-08T23:22:38] Oreo huzky: Okay but I already got stutters at 150A phase with 75200
[2023-08-08T23:23:01] Oreo huzky: Ah
[2023-08-08T23:23:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: Nahhh I pushed 350 no prob
[2023-08-08T23:23:30] Oreo huzky: But why did I got stutters at such low amps
[2023-08-08T23:23:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: You have to set hall to sensorless switching at like 4000-6000erpm
[2023-08-08T23:23:56] Oreo huzky: Yea it was hella goofy
[2023-08-08T23:24:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: Huameng stator is small
[2023-08-08T23:24:20] Oreo huzky: Do I have to do that with cl350 too?
[2023-08-08T23:24:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: If iron core is small then the saturation point is much before
[2023-08-08T23:25:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: 127mm stator I think can handle about 250A without saturate üòÇ
[2023-08-08T23:25:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Huameng is about 150
[2023-08-08T23:26:03] Oreo huzky: ?
[2023-08-08T23:26:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: Depends by motor, if motor is small yes, because if motor saturate your motor will vibrate so much
[2023-08-08T23:26:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs motor problem, not controller
[2023-08-08T23:26:55] Oreo huzky: Okay
[2023-08-08T23:27:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Hall sensor is made to help tracking motor position when motor is saturated , like at start when the phase current is so high
[2023-08-08T23:28:42] Happy Giraffe: Hmm this might be the reason why my motor also runs toasty on low speed. Foc (sensorless) not that nice for itü§î
[2023-08-08T23:29:44] Happy Giraffe: But damn is it a lot of work tuning the halls
[2023-08-08T23:30:34] Happy Giraffe: For my motor Ortega doesnt handle more than 80A phase, Mxlemming goes 110A smoother
[2023-08-08T23:31:24] Happy Giraffe: I have to use comp as its 20mm statorüòÇ
[2023-08-08T23:32:06] Happy Giraffe: Yeah for scooter motor I also used ortega no comp
[2023-08-08T23:33:20] Oreo huzky: Anything else that I need to change?
[2023-08-08T23:34:38] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, seems mxlemming throws a bit more current in somehow. I will compare a bit how Ortega works later. Same amps and settings with just observer diff

[2023-08-08T23:49:05] Simone: that's the story
[2023-08-08T23:53:20] Martin Kaktits: fuck those fucking halls. I run sensoreless and almost forgot i dont have working halls anymore. Ok, so u cant start from total 0, but u can start from 0.1kmh ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[2023-08-08T23:57:49] Martin Kaktits: u already lost me at the title
[2023-08-09T00:03:41] Pablo Fernandez: Man i wanted to make a escooter fast and i Will end Up with 5 degrees
[2023-08-09T11:17:39] Zak: Does this seem like excessive downramp with field weakening enabled?
[2023-08-09T11:18:01] Zak: Field weakening enabled
[2023-08-09T11:18:08] Zak: Field weakening disabled
[2023-08-09T11:24:53] Zak: <video_file>
[2023-08-09T11:48:55] Finn: Set max duty to 97%
[2023-08-09T11:48:58] Finn: For extra speed
[2023-08-09T11:49:51] Zak: Im more worried about how long it takes to ramp down out of field weakening
[2023-08-09T11:50:51] Finn: What are your settings
[2023-08-09T11:51:28] Zak: Can you be more specific. Theres a lot of settings in vesc
[2023-08-09T11:51:36] Finn: Your field weaking settings
[2023-08-09T11:52:27] Zak: <photos/photo_9259@09-08-2023_11-52-27.jpg>
[2023-08-09T11:52:42] Finn: Put field weak ramp time to 400ms
[2023-08-09T11:52:52] Zak: Ok I'll try
[2023-08-09T11:52:58] Finn: Default is 200ms
[2023-08-09T11:53:22] Zak: 2nd vesc isnt turning on over canbus either
[2023-08-09T11:53:45] Finn: Hm
[2023-08-09T11:53:47] Finn: Why that
[2023-08-09T11:57:16] Happy Giraffe: Yes this is a must, I use 600
[2023-08-09T11:58:56] Finn: I dont even need field weaking to be honest. I tried it with 16s and got from 70kmh to 75. And now with 20s i drive ~85kmh without fw
[2023-08-09T12:00:43] Zak: Yes does 88kmh without fw but my fat fking friend it would do 50kmh with his weight
[2023-08-09T12:01:24] Finn: More phase amps
[2023-08-09T12:03:09] Zak: Already 120
[2023-08-09T12:05:52] Finn: What controller?
[2023-08-09T12:12:17] Zak: Raiden 7 hv
[2023-08-09T12:16:06] Zak: <video_file>
[2023-08-09T12:16:09] Zak: Set to 400ms makes it stay open throttle for longer
[2023-08-09T12:18:50] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I also have 94% duty cycle just for the one road I gotta ride with cars
[2023-08-09T12:20:16] Happy Giraffe: Yea it will behave differently on air and on road
[2023-08-09T12:47:37] Zak: It gets stuck at 10% less duty cycle than the field weakening duty start
[2023-08-09T12:56:03] Simone: the magic flux weakening
[2023-08-09T12:58:59] Zak: You definitely worse then mine. Did you fix it
[2023-08-09T14:42:29] Happy Giraffe: Then you don't have enough power to reach maximum speed I think. If you use FW it will just warm motor more for little speed

[2023-08-09T15:19:34] Finn: Box?
[2023-08-09T15:19:54] Finn: Mine burns at 170A phase. Runs with 40 degrees at 80kmh

[2023-08-09T15:24:55] Simone: mosfet is fixed in a big aluminium plate inside this box
[2023-08-09T15:25:23] Simone: and a lot of air
[2023-08-09T15:26:34] Simone: but i'm testing, i'm making a big battery
[2023-08-09T18:06:04] Unknown: Does nutt brake sensor need resistor and if it does what kind
[2023-08-09T18:06:26] Unknown: 75200 makerbase
[2023-08-09T18:15:10] Happy Giraffe: Thats a big tireüòÇ
[2023-08-09T19:05:57] Ofek üê•: If the brake sensor is a switch you can use 5-10K pullup resistor
[2023-08-09T19:21:00] Unknown: 12 or 14 by the looks of it
[2023-08-09T19:21:40] Unknown: It's not a switch it's like hall sensor there's a magnet in the brake handle and a sensor on the bottom
[2023-08-09T20:33:22] Happy Giraffe: Very hard to pick up differences at low speed. Then Im using sensored anyways. Highspeed 60% duty the Ortega seems to hold more torque
[2023-08-09T20:33:33] Happy Giraffe: But difference is minimal, maybe 5%
[2023-08-09T23:25:41] Simone: 16
[2023-08-10T08:16:54] AK: No it is not a hall sensor
[2023-08-10T08:24:15] Mirono escooters: Reed switch
[2023-08-10T08:24:27] Mirono escooters: Sometimes it's hall sensor but rarely
[2023-08-10T08:24:57] AK: Hall sensor can not be a passive element, so 2 wires = always reed
[2023-08-10T08:26:55] Mirono escooters: I kno
[2023-08-10T08:34:11] Simone: Flipsky 410 hardware, with 6.02 firmware and 20A flux, big whell 16" , 48v battery 20Ah, 60A daly bms. Some hack for cooler controller

[2023-08-11T07:06:12] rosheee: no load on ride and esc temp goes 0-80 in 3sec xD?
[2023-08-11T07:10:40] Simone: of course, is just a test for see how the motor work
[2023-08-11T07:18:48] rosheee: but what is magic flux weakening?
[2023-08-11T07:50:01] rosheee: omg why caps always sad üòû
[2023-08-11T07:50:09] Simone: tweack for inprove motor speed
[2023-08-11T07:50:41] rosheee: Field weakening?
[2023-08-11T07:52:21] Mirono escooters: Flux/ field weakening
[2023-08-11T07:52:31] rosheee: Ah ^_^
[2023-08-11T07:52:43] rosheee: Maybe it helps against poppin' caps?
[2023-08-11T07:53:05] Mirono escooters: I can't imagine any reason why it would
[2023-08-11T07:53:14] Mirono escooters: If only it creates more backemf
[2023-08-11T07:53:45] gil guy: @Nico_user1 can you measure this? Actually with 10x2.50,I plan to place 10x3.00 on a 500w monorim motor on a front monorim fork ..thanks..
[2023-08-11T07:56:24] rosheee: ;-)
[2023-08-11T08:02:27] rosheee: what if only 2-3 caps remaining on esc (of 6 as exmpl.) ? why it still works?
[2023-08-11T08:05:40] Mirono escooters: Because they still filter, but they'll die soon after. More stress on already stressed caps
[2023-08-11T08:05:55] Mirono escooters: A controller can even run without caps .. for a short timr
[2023-08-11T08:06:14] rosheee: yah 2-3 popped
[2023-08-11T08:06:24] Mirono escooters: Rip
[2023-08-11T08:06:29] rosheee: ah still works
[2023-08-11T08:06:32] Mirono escooters: Add bigger
[2023-08-11T08:06:34] rosheee: ¬®^^' idk when popped
[2023-08-11T08:06:42] rosheee: i ordered b
[2023-08-11T08:06:45] rosheee: but lost in germany
[2023-08-11T08:06:48] rosheee: also more fuckeria mosfets
[2023-08-11T08:07:46] Face de Pin Suc√©: That's because you keep using controllers not really designed for power hehe
[2023-08-11T08:08:27] puneDir: i managed to pop pro2 esc caps with 36v battery stock motor
[2023-08-11T08:08:40] rosheee: ah but they work suc√© just have to change caps
[2023-08-11T08:09:51] Mirono escooters: Didn't like 5 blow up / randomly die?
[2023-08-11T08:10:59] rosheee: Ah just 1-2 each esc
[2023-08-11T08:11:30] rosheee: Rear 3 rdy 2 blow and front 1 gone
[2023-08-11T08:12:53] rosheee: ^^
[2023-08-11T08:13:57] Mirono escooters: Looks close enough

[2023-08-11T08:17:18] rosheee: yah ^^'' i trust it but these scns frames fail a lot, aren't they?
[2023-08-11T08:17:49] AK: Frames don't fail if you don't do retarded things
[2023-08-11T08:17:50] puneDir: Ye

[2023-08-11T17:59:55] Finn: Where sits your ble module
[2023-08-11T18:00:07] Finn: If its close to the phase wires it can cause interferenxe
[2023-08-11T18:00:37] Chen Simhony: Its near the controller

[2023-08-12T11:00:32] puneDir: Add field weakening to rear maybe
[2023-08-12T11:02:29] TrentXWB: Can‚Äôt find this option in my iPhone VESC app
[2023-08-12T11:03:20] TrentXWB: <photos/photo_9284@12-08-2023_11-03-20.jpg>
[2023-08-12T11:26:28] Mirono escooters: Just get matching motors There's no good solution for mixing
[2023-08-12T12:27:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: FOC -> field weakening
[2023-08-12T12:42:29] TrentXWB: <photos/photo_9285@12-08-2023_12-42-29.jpg>
[2023-08-12T12:42:53] TrentXWB: It‚Äôs not there (field weakening)
[2023-08-12T12:44:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: You‚Äôve < 5.2 version firmware
[2023-08-12T13:16:29] Gabe Enzo: with matching motors you can put 30A front 20A rear and it's fine
[2023-08-12T13:16:36] Gabe Enzo: for example
[2023-08-12T15:55:51] Mirono escooters: Bwuh
[2023-08-12T15:55:53] Mirono escooters: Such shit
[2023-08-12T15:58:44] Simone: look the impostation of traction control
[2023-08-12T15:59:49] Simone: <photos/photo_9286@12-08-2023_15-59-49.jpg>
[2023-08-12T16:40:03] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I don't think traction control will help with this issue, it will definitely cause it to do weird shit.
[2023-08-12T16:40:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: He should update his firmware to 6.2 and use field weakening.
[2023-08-12T17:04:45] Nick: The one I put in my meepo didn't have it but is there a way to make the Spintend controller only activate once a pin is entered into the app or physically on the bike?

[2023-08-12T19:29:05] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, turn down your max duty cycle percent on your faster motor to match rpms with slower motor.
[2023-08-12T19:29:53] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Or set max rpm on front to match with rear motor if you dont want to reduce duty cycle. And make both rpm limits for both motors to not deal with voltage speed drop with rear motor
[2023-08-12T19:46:37] Ofek üê•: Come to a meeting, now you have a working scooter

[2023-08-13T12:16:45] Mirko Boni: Thank you for the answer.. Unfortunately I find various news in the forums, but very generic.. To date I have not found any guide explaining how to connect the PAS sensor to the ADC module..
[2023-08-13T13:04:15] Happy Giraffe: There are companies like CYC Motors that use both at the same time on their own vesc. They benefit from open platform and so far havent contributed much. Maybe you can ask them.
[2023-08-13T13:04:50] Happy Giraffe: I also would like cadence sensor to output small continuous power and then torque sensor to kick in uphills etc
[2023-08-13T13:05:46] Mirko Boni: In fact, Cyc uses a mix of a cadence sensor and a power sensor.
[2023-08-13T13:06:38] Mirko Boni: Unfortunately @jamessoderstrom has become very lazy.. By now he only thinks about building dualtron scooters.. üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-08-13T13:15:45] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, would be interesting if they shared anything
[2023-08-13T13:47:25] Mirko Boni: I think it will never happen.. In my opinion they keep it hidden.. I want to make my cannondale 20S mountain bike with the 3000w rear hub motor and the vesc.. But it seems that it is very complicated to adapt the PAS function..
[2023-08-13T13:47:40] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_9288@13-08-2023_13-47-40.jpg>
[2023-08-13T13:49:26] Mirko Boni: This is my bike, it's an XL size, so I have plenty of room for the battery and controller.. There is only one problem, the rear drop out is 135mm.. A QS 205 motor has a 150mm drop out
[2023-08-13T13:50:21] Mirko Boni: I will be forced to buy the aliexpress kits with 3000w motor including display controller and accelerator .. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ

[2023-08-13T14:54:14] Happy Giraffe: No no no
[2023-08-13T14:55:04] Happy Giraffe: If your rear dropout is Quick Release then get Mxus 3K turbo. Has 45mm magnets and loses only slightly to 205
[2023-08-13T14:55:29] Happy Giraffe: Ferrofluid the Mxus with Turbinators/Hubsinks and its 10kw easy
[2023-08-13T15:01:52] Happy Giraffe: Oh wait, it migh be 145mm I double check
[2023-08-13T15:03:15] Happy Giraffe: I remember now, 135mm with single speed chain and 145mm with freewheel
[2023-08-13T15:11:42] Mirko Boni: Single chain no problem, but is Mxus high speed? I don't want it with an exaggerated torque, I prefer speed.. I live in the plain..
[2023-08-13T15:13:02] Happy Giraffe: You can calculate speed with kv. They got many different windings
[2023-08-13T15:13:47] Happy Giraffe: 20s will surely give you enough even with slow windüòÇ
[2023-08-13T15:16:08] Happy Giraffe: 20S 4T and 29" will give you max speed of ~ 66kmh
[2023-08-13T15:18:48] Mirko Boni: My bike is a 26 inch.. If it does 66 km/h then it's a high torque..
[2023-08-13T15:19:08] Mirko Boni: I'm looking for a 3.5T
[2023-08-13T15:19:20] Happy Giraffe: Naah they got 3-6T
[2023-08-13T15:19:40] Happy Giraffe: It was also at 72v not 84v
[2023-08-13T15:20:44] Happy Giraffe: 3T 26" 72v is 75kmh
[2023-08-13T15:23:20] Happy Giraffe: Or you can get a mid drive if you prefer like Lightning Rods
[2023-08-13T15:35:48] TrentXWB: After updating both 75100 VESC from 5.2 to 6.2 motors are no longer working! Front motor M365 does not turn (only makes noise) and rear motor (1200 w fake motor) makes horrible noise üò≠
[2023-08-13T15:36:16] TrentXWB: Can I downgrade VESCs?
[2023-08-13T15:51:31] Finn: Stlinkü§°
[2023-08-13T15:51:58] Mirono escooters: You flash whatever you want
[2023-08-13T15:52:09] Mirono escooters: Calibrate motors
[2023-08-13T15:55:28] Mirko Boni: I don't know this lightning rods.. I know bafang and cx1
[2023-08-13T15:57:36] Happy Giraffe: Yeah do as you like the are many motorsüòÅ
[2023-08-13T16:02:43] Mirko Boni: To get more speed in my opinion the rear engine is better
[2023-08-13T16:08:12] TrentXWB: Ok downgrade to 5.2 and it‚Äôs working fine. In which version field weakening came in?
[2023-08-13T16:08:39] Mirono escooters: 6 afaik
[2023-08-13T16:11:39] Mirono escooters: Fak
[2023-08-13T16:18:17] Happy Giraffe: If you care about efficiency maybe X1Pro could be good as you would get benefits of the drivetrain
[2023-08-13T16:21:25] Mirko Boni: Thanks for the help.. Did you see that it has become unobtainable? It's sold out in stores
[2023-08-13T16:27:58] Happy Giraffe: I can put it on my shopping cart and chekout ok

[2023-08-13T16:31:05] Happy Giraffe: Motor reduction is 219 chain. Other chain is shity bicycle one
[2023-08-13T16:31:48] Mirko Boni: Nooo üòÇüòÇ I'm talking about European shops

[2023-08-13T16:40:38] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, need custom solution maybe
[2023-08-13T16:47:17] Happy Giraffe: Im planning 219 or 510 chain for my bike. Needs custom rear hub with special cog and freewheel adapter and even then it will be a single speedüòÅ However the Lightning Rods motor should take care of the powerüòÅ
[2023-08-13T16:47:28] Mirono escooters: Single speeed
[2023-08-13T17:01:42] Mirko Boni: I have to look up information on this engine
[2023-08-13T17:45:27] Happy Giraffe: High Voltage youtube channel and then their Discord. You can talk to the dealer/manufacturer directly. He even showed me option to have bike chain on left and motor chain on right with disc brakeüòÇüòÇ
[2023-08-13T17:49:24] Mirko Boni: Really? Woow

[2023-08-13T20:57:23] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: What firmware did you flash?
[2023-08-13T20:57:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 75_100 75_100_V2 75_300 ?
[2023-08-13T21:48:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/pull/624 the odometer is finally usable! :)
[2023-08-13T21:49:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: on hardware without software shutdown
[2023-08-13T22:14:30] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It shouldn't but I'm not sure.
[2023-08-13T22:14:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Reducing possibility to write backup data frequently, now requires minimum distance to be traveled before it enables storing, common condition if push to start is enabled with a low shutdown time, say 10s, or in any other condition where user turn on/off ESC a lot of times. Saves chip life at the cost of not having updated data during very short trips.
[2023-08-13T22:15:17] puneDir: How to use it
[2023-08-13T22:15:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It just works
[2023-08-13T22:15:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: Thanks to us üòú
[2023-08-13T22:15:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I still need to try it myself but I think it should be good.
[2023-08-13T22:16:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: It was reserved , but we decided to publish it
[2023-08-13T22:16:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Good
[2023-08-13T22:16:37] puneDir: we need to update vesc to newest?
[2023-08-13T22:16:50] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Of course, but it's 6.05 BETA
[2023-08-13T22:17:10] puneDir: It still saves data after removing the battery right
[2023-08-13T22:18:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It saves the odometer data when you stay for some time and travelled a certain distance.
[2023-08-13T22:19:02] puneDir: Oh so nice
[2023-08-13T22:19:12] puneDir: Finally i can know my total kilometer

[2023-08-13T23:02:41] FrizerSeb: I have 18s5p jkbms80a vesc spinted 80v and vsett10 motor
[2023-08-13T23:10:14] FrizerSeb: I intend to use it to reach 190 phase
[2023-08-13T23:11:52] FrizerSeb: 3shunt on 80v spinted it's ok for activate ?
[2023-08-13T23:16:17] FrizerSeb: No ok with ferrofluid ?
[2023-08-13T23:19:13] FrizerSeb: Ok James and how max phase this motor can ? IS true IS hot very Quick i have sonde temp
[2023-08-13T23:36:16] Happy Giraffe: Could Vesc have a profile enabled throttle? Like throttle on for one profile and throttle deactivated on other after reboot?ü§î
[2023-08-13T23:36:29] Happy Giraffe: Would it be possible in the firmware?
[2023-08-14T00:01:24] rosheee: let me check
[2023-08-14T00:01:38] rosheee: u didn't used the code i did long time ago for your question i forgot ^^?
[2023-08-14T00:07:34] FrizerSeb: Single for moment and dual as soon as I received the arms to modify the rear m365

[2023-08-14T09:49:03] AK: gl with resetting settings and stm swaps
[2023-08-14T10:01:44] AK: Don't matter what intervals, vesc has f4xx, and no eeprom
[2023-08-14T10:01:56] AK: You can at most expect about 10k writes
[2023-08-14T10:02:09] AK: Every config change = write
[2023-08-14T10:03:49] AK: The best part about it is that the 10k is an average, you can not be sure that you won't get a specific place which wears out quickly
[2023-08-14T10:04:12] AK: It's one of the weakest things in the vesc in general tbh, the reliance on 4xx flash
[2023-08-14T10:04:33] Mirono escooters: :(
[2023-08-14T10:05:15] AK: And when it does you get retarded "fuckeria" as you would put it, where settings magically change and shit like that
[2023-08-14T10:05:57] AK: But the odometer is a good thing still, better have it in place and have later designs have an eeprom
[2023-08-14T10:06:36] AK: It's kinda like chicken and egg problem, where you don't need eprom if you dont regularly write, and you don't write if you don't have eeprom
[2023-08-14T10:11:14] AK: I can only vouch for myself, I don't write stuff, it's not persistent between reboots
[2023-08-14T10:11:34] AK: If you would switch profiles by writing settings, yeah, certainly would
[2023-08-14T10:12:24] AK: Yeah, they are applied, but not written, that's why repowering removes settings set by lisp
[2023-08-14T10:12:50] AK: You could write them, but I considered it tu be useless and wasteful, I just apply them every time there is a change to profile selection
[2023-08-14T10:14:51] AK: You still should propably get an stm or two on storage, tbh
[2023-08-14T10:15:44] AK: If you use the "use until reboot", then you don't write
[2023-08-14T10:16:10] AK: yeah, it's bad wording, what is meant is "written to communication", I guess
[2023-08-14T10:20:25] AK: Well, its not so bad, 10k is an average, if you do 4 turn off cycles a day, that's like 7 years for the odo to wear stuff out
[2023-08-14T10:20:53] AK: but yeah, I am personally also on the anxious side tbh
[2023-08-14T10:21:11] AK: sd card slots for settings and shizzle when
[2023-08-14T10:57:51] Gabe Enzo: can the rear monorim suspension support 6.5" motors and 11" tyres?
[2023-08-14T12:22:29] gil guy: Wich torque sensor do you have ? Direct dc output ? Interested..
[2023-08-14T12:26:22] AK: I am not sure, I did not check the code, I would expect it all to run only on shutdown
[2023-08-14T12:50:09] rosheee: Newest focer revision
[2023-08-14T12:50:28] Mirono escooters: What changed
[2023-08-14T12:58:14] FrizerSeb: yes it is possible by making some modifications or rather opt for arms that are more suitable for an engine like the vsett
[2023-08-14T13:09:05] rosheee: idk
[2023-08-14T13:19:14] Happy Giraffe: eRiderT9N
[2023-08-14T15:24:38] Happy Giraffe: Its discontinued and there might be better sensors out there. Its okay but doesnt give steady output. They are rather these spikes that happen when you apply force to left or right pedal
[2023-08-14T15:25:07] Happy Giraffe: I've messed around adc settings etc to make it work better
[2023-08-14T15:26:42] Mirko Boni: @Happy_Giraffe I bought the motor.. I got the 3T version

[2023-08-14T15:28:07] Happy Giraffe: Torque arms will be critical, they need to sit tight and help the bike dropout as much as possible
[2023-08-14T15:28:36] Happy Giraffe: This motor will kick ass
[2023-08-14T15:28:46] Mirko Boni: Yess exactly.. I got them in stainless steel.. One for the right and one for the left
[2023-08-14T15:29:12] Mirko Boni: I've seen the videos on youtube.. It reaches incredible speeds

[2023-08-14T15:35:30] Mirko Boni: I am very sorry
[2023-08-14T15:35:43] Happy Giraffe: Otherwise I could also buy it but its too heavy and bulky for my use and attracts too much looks
[2023-08-14T15:35:54] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-08-14T15:36:06] Mirono escooters: Nah, univ
[2023-08-14T15:36:16] Mirono escooters: Owo
[2023-08-14T15:36:17] Mirko Boni: Are you afraid the police might check?
[2023-08-14T15:36:24] Mirono escooters: Im not spending like 4k to have a dirt bike I'll never use
[2023-08-14T15:37:05] Mirko Boni: For this reason I prefer to modify my mtb.. It must seem normal.. But instead it is a demon
[2023-08-14T15:37:09] Happy Giraffe: It's also for the people that get mad and start trouble
[2023-08-14T15:37:33] Happy Giraffe: I ride 40kmh everyday on bike lanes and nobody bats an eye because its still a bikeüòÅ
[2023-08-14T15:37:36] Mirko Boni: Ok ok..
[2023-08-14T15:38:00] Mirono escooters: I wanted 120kmh, no bike frame like
[2023-08-14T15:38:16] Mirko Boni: Exactly.. But I have to be able to install the pas in the vesc
[2023-08-14T15:38:43] Happy Giraffe: Need to move to another city to study and test cops again, if they didnt make a note in their systems about youüòÇ
[2023-08-14T15:39:12] Mirko Boni: If you install the 273 in the cost bike it is possible to reach 130 km/h
[2023-08-14T15:39:23] Happy Giraffe: I just pay the insurance here for throttle legalityüëç
[2023-08-14T15:39:38] Mirono escooters: Ez
[2023-08-14T15:39:44] Mirono escooters: But I wanted a good strong frame
[2023-08-14T15:39:46] Mirono escooters: And this is
[2023-08-14T15:39:49] Mirono escooters: But now no time
[2023-08-14T15:39:52] Mirono escooters: Other things Todo
[2023-08-14T15:39:54] Mirko Boni: I have a friend who has a bike with a cromotor engine, it reaches 130 km/h
[2023-08-14T15:40:02] Mirono escooters: I can ride it, I don't want
[2023-08-14T15:40:25] Happy Giraffe: Yeah this at 25kmhüëÄ
[2023-08-14T15:40:25] Mirono escooters: Doesn't sell ez tho, small public for it
[2023-08-14T15:40:32] Mirono escooters: Blabla
[2023-08-14T15:40:47] Mirono escooters: Or i store it for years but bweh bweh bweh
[2023-08-14T15:41:34] Mirko Boni: In Italy it is impossible to have an accelerator
[2023-08-14T15:41:35] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_9296@14-08-2023_15-41-35.jpg>
[2023-08-14T15:41:57] Mirono escooters: Same üò†
[2023-08-14T15:42:35] Mirko Boni: That's why I need the pass.. So then if the police stop me with a button I deactivate the accelerator
[2023-08-14T15:45:26] Mirko Boni: @Happy_Giraffe but do mx turbo motors have 23 poles? Or 23+23? I read the specifications but I don't understand..
[2023-08-14T15:46:08] Mirko Boni: <photos/photo_9297@14-08-2023_15-46-08.jpg>
[2023-08-14T15:48:04] Mirono escooters: 46 magnets
[2023-08-14T15:48:09] Mirono escooters: Pole pair 23
[2023-08-14T15:49:01] Mirko Boni: But in the vesc what number should I set? 23 or 46?
[2023-08-14T15:49:17] Mirono escooters: 46
[2023-08-14T15:52:50] Happy Giraffe: Figure it out when you got motor. Its for speed calculation only
[2023-08-14T15:53:09] Happy Giraffe: If speed is double half the valueüòÅüëç easy no stress
[2023-08-14T15:55:08] Mirko Boni: Ok ok thanks..

[2023-08-14T17:40:15] Nick: I want to make it so if I put the bike in sport profile a bunch of fans and light strips inside the bike turn red it'd be sick
[2023-08-14T17:40:42] Nick: Is there an RGB controller I can buy for that type of thing?

[2023-08-14T18:44:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes but the good think of ti220 is that you can screw the mosfet
[2023-08-14T18:44:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: So what‚Äôs the point doing this hahaha

[2023-08-15T11:47:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: @Happy_Giraffe surly does ,but what's your prob? Basically simple animal
[2023-08-15T11:49:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: For this, we would need to see what's in your setup
[2023-08-15T11:54:48] Simone: for use in a "legal" ebike profile
[2023-08-15T12:06:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: That what Happy does also
[2023-08-15T12:08:35] Happy Giraffe: Not pas but a torque sensor
[2023-08-15T12:08:48] Happy Giraffe: For PAS magnet sensor I have no idea how to connect
[2023-08-15T12:12:22] Simone: is similar, i don't understood how.to connect to vesc, if i loose uart port or not
[2023-08-15T12:41:03] Happy Giraffe: Not really, PAS is sending pulses as the magnets rotate. Torque sensor acts like a throttle depending on load
[2023-08-15T12:41:54] Simone: ok, you don't use the native pas in vesc
[2023-08-15T12:41:58] Happy Giraffe: PAS might be tuned to vary intensity but it will always be about the speed of the pulses/crank speed
[2023-08-15T12:42:11] Happy Giraffe: Nope, just torque sensor
[2023-08-15T12:42:45] Simone: ok, thank you, i will convert pas impulse in a volt variable with arduini
[2023-08-15T12:43:12] Happy Giraffe: It might be easier just to use the pas with a set power
[2023-08-15T12:43:24] Happy Giraffe: Like in market ebikes
[2023-08-15T12:43:50] Happy Giraffe: But I'm not sure how to connect it
[2023-08-15T13:02:19] Simone: i read to use direct tx and rx of uart port, but you loose the bluetooth connection
[2023-08-15T13:08:03] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, losing BT sucks ass
[2023-08-15T13:08:24] Happy Giraffe: Better for you to get a torque sensor, iex. torque sensing bottom bracket
[2023-08-15T13:08:35] Simone: yes, is a great solution
[2023-08-15T14:14:05] Happy Giraffe: Is Kelly and Sabvoton out of the question for a 12kw mid drive ebike? Or should I start with vesc. Do they have an option for keyed speed limit or profiles?
[2023-08-15T14:16:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: No good
[2023-08-15T14:16:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: Get vesc

[2023-08-15T14:43:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Pass total same
[2023-08-15T14:44:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Stupid throttle what adds "gas" as magnets turn before sensor , basically not a nasa science
[2023-08-15T14:46:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: This depends on ,if you go awd there you have the port againü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ

[2023-08-15T14:57:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Thanks, thinking of giving a try
[2023-08-15T14:58:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I am more about the water cooled but would long to explain what i want ,
[2023-08-15T14:58:42] Simone: no way for profile, only 3 speed switch programmable on percentual of max power
[2023-08-15T15:04:10] Luis Magalhaes: He has one but i think he never tested it yet
[2023-08-15T15:15:11] Happy Giraffe: I mean torque sensor is much different from PASüòÖüò≥
[2023-08-15T15:15:37] Happy Giraffe: Damn, cops will fuk me then
[2023-08-15T15:16:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What it does yes
[2023-08-15T18:22:09] Jedich Nixan: Hi. Does some1 know how to connect the the Spiny Throttle?
[2023-08-15T18:23:19] Jedich Nixan: <photos/photo_9303@15-08-2023_18-23-19.jpg>
[2023-08-15T18:24:57] Jedich Nixan: As the Dashboard has the Conntector for Brake, I'm not sure if the Cables from Spiny goes directly to vesc or first to Dashboard. Bc the Dashboard goes to the vesc as well, right?
[2023-08-15T19:39:46] Happy Giraffe: What electric device you have?üòÅ
[2023-08-15T19:40:58] Happy Giraffe: If now all variable regen etc works then display would be my bet. Especially if it's meant to be used with vesc
[2023-08-15T19:45:06] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Because stock dualtron uses bldc, not foc and start has pulse current cause of sensorless mode. Foc always more smooth and better
[2023-08-15T20:14:33] Jedich Nixan: You mean Controller?
[2023-08-15T20:30:51] Simone: <photos/photo_9304@15-08-2023_20-30-51.jpg>
[2023-08-15T20:31:12] Simone: Mantis ex kelly 7212s now with 2√ó flipsky 75200 üòÇ
[2023-08-15T20:31:56] Simone: traction control works wonders...
[2023-08-15T20:33:15] Simone: improvements on all fronts...acceleration and top speed
[2023-08-15T20:33:56] Simone: I think it's one of the fastest 10" escooters üòÖüòÇ
[2023-08-15T20:34:13] Simone: No field weakening
[2023-08-15T20:34:26] Jedich Nixan: The Question is also which cables from Spiny do i need? Black and Red is without Question, but White goes to ADC1, Green is useless as it says its NOT for Vesc, Yellow is which i dunno yet and Blue seems to me for the E Brake for both Motors, that would be go either straight to my Main 75100er Controller, OR first to Dashboard (where my Braking Lights were connected), and then continue from Dashboard to 75100 Controller on COMM-Port.
[2023-08-15T20:34:37] Simone: <photos/photo_9305@15-08-2023_20-34-37.jpg>

[2023-08-15T20:38:16] Jedich Nixan: Yea thats the question, the Spiny is my NEW Throttle, which i dunno yet where to connect it right. As for now both 75100er Controllers are not updated, i need this to do too, but i just wanted to know first where & which cables from Spiny goes where..
[2023-08-15T20:38:32] Jedich Nixan: NineBitch G30DII
[2023-08-15T20:38:45] Jedich Nixan: With 2x 75100er Pro Alu PCB
[2023-08-15T20:41:16] Jedich Nixan: ok i see.. but dont i need the 1zuna scripts when i updating and configurating my both controllers?
[2023-08-15T20:42:55] Jedich Nixan: 1zunas Guide says i need to donwgrade the dashbaord to xiaomi version i think..
[2023-08-15T20:43:06] Jedich Nixan: so its not g30 stock then, after downgrading.

[2023-08-15T20:43:55] Jakub Szczypi√≥r: How many amps are you using per motor?
[2023-08-15T20:44:50] Simone: Yes
[2023-08-15T20:45:44] Simone: Inside I have 21s6p
[2023-08-15T20:45:46] Jakub Szczypi√≥r: No, battery is 20s6p on samsung 40t, controllers are in the place where stock controller is
[2023-08-15T20:46:33] Jakub Szczypi√≥r: Sorry 75100
[2023-08-15T20:46:36] Jakub Szczypi√≥r: Box one
[2023-08-15T20:46:37] Jedich Nixan: sounds greats, thanks. so i can choose freely which option i will use..
[2023-08-15T20:47:14] Jakub Szczypi√≥r: Barely but it does
[2023-08-15T20:47:58] Jedich Nixan: sry, as a newbie i dont know what spinted adc v2 is meaning. like an extra board to connect on a controller? nevermind. as long as i can choose 1 or 2 i'm ok with it
[2023-08-15T20:49:58] Jedich Nixan: ahh ok i see. but whats the benefit then? you already have on the controller already a connector for throttle and brake?
[2023-08-15T20:50:06] Simone: very good ... for a while it sticks to my escooter with LY 70H, 22S10P & Kelly 7230s
[2023-08-15T20:50:25] Jedich Nixan: hold on a sec.
[2023-08-15T20:50:45] Jedich Nixan: i see
[2023-08-15T20:51:25] Jedich Nixan: if i choose 2 (connecting it directly to 75100), i will stay with that... "then wire up dash later" makes me confusing a lil
[2023-08-15T20:51:46] Jedich Nixan: like go with 2, later you can wire up the dashboard *also*
[2023-08-15T20:52:56] Jedich Nixan: so you say (thats what i'm understanding) the spiny cables goes to dashboard AND to Controller?
[2023-08-15T20:53:59] Jedich Nixan: i guess the controller sends those informations back to dashboard, for displaying speed, batt % etc..
[2023-08-15T20:57:06] Jedich Nixan: i see the blue will be useless then. if so, the green for throttle directly on controller is not even for throttle also for e braking?
[2023-08-15T21:00:07] Jedich Nixan: allright, but how can i use the e brakes then, if the blue one is not conntect? as the spiny has a e brake "spin"?
[2023-08-15T21:00:34] Jedich Nixan: you spin it left : throttle, spin right : braking
[2023-08-15T21:03:00] Jedich Nixan: that makes sense
[2023-08-15T21:03:07] Simone: Nono üòÇ 70H 11"...I'm talking about my escooter in profile picture
[2023-08-15T21:04:06] Simone: <photos/photo_9307@15-08-2023_21-04-06.jpg>
[2023-08-15T21:05:37] Jedich Nixan: so the COMM Port on Controller is already connected from spiny, right? What about the cables from Dashboard then?
[2023-08-15T21:06:42] Simone: I confirm that the cables heat up enough ... they are at the limit ...
[2023-08-15T21:07:51] Jedich Nixan: ok so 5v & Gnd for both (Dash and Spiny), 3.3v is gonna be used to, TX & RX for Dash only and ADC2 is only whats left...
[2023-08-15T21:09:45] Simone: Thanks üòä I modified the vsett11 and zero11x fusions and redesigned the whole central part
[2023-08-15T21:11:08] Simone: it's not on the verge of melting...you can hold it in your hand without burning. It's currently set for 140A batt and 290/350A phase for unit
[2023-08-15T21:11:16] Jedich Nixan: is the adc2 for scooters? or maybe other rides
[2023-08-15T21:11:44] Jedich Nixan: just asking me what i could be for
[2023-08-15T21:12:46] Jedich Nixan: i see
[2023-08-15T21:13:07] Jedich Nixan: thanks so far @jamessoderstrom
[2023-08-15T21:15:16] Happy Giraffe: I got a valuable opinion from ebike community about vesc MTPA
[2023-08-15T21:15:23] Happy Giraffe: "The MTPA in VESC produces an absurd power boost on these LR IPM motors, felt like I bumped the phase amps up 20% after turning it on, feels like a waste now to use a controller without MTPA, also makes tuning easier"
[2023-08-15T21:16:04] Happy Giraffe: "Currently IQ Target but that's the only one I tried, 120PA on a SB. I had planned to turn it on after I had the motor tuned but was having a lot of trouble with the sensor-sensorless transition issue and I just turned it on after running out of ideas which it both solved the transition issue and I was shocked how obvious the power boost was. Although this is not actually that surprising knowing these motors have a fair bit of saliency and how MPTA works: https://hackaday.io/project/164932-axiom-100kw-motor-controller/log/179447-mtpa-merged-into-vesc I don't fully understand how it works enough to say for sure the pros and cons but I believe the only con is it's not all free power. You get more power out in the form of increased torque through a wider RPM range and more speed at higher RPM ranges (due to the more torque) but you of course have to put more power in, it's just a little more efficient way of increasing torque than raw phase amps at the low rpm range and more voltage/faster gearing at the high rpm range. It works on the same principles of field weakening but without the weakening part I guess"
[2023-08-15T21:16:20] Simone: it is the only solution other than that of the kaboo wolf king the problem is the width of the fork that limits the size of engine you can put ... putting the 70H was a nightmare
[2023-08-15T21:17:21] Simone: I didn't expect it, to be honest...if it doesn't burn out and assure me reliability like Kelly, I'd say it was a big step forward
[2023-08-15T21:19:00] Simone: another drawback of the vesc (but this applies to flipsky) is that it can not be turned off
[2023-08-15T21:19:29] Happy Giraffe: And wingdings being outside in the stator=cooolingüåö Fuck Im going to build a monster
[2023-08-15T21:31:02] Jedich Nixan: The Spiny has on the backside a button, it says it supports cruise and others.
[2023-08-15T21:34:16] Jedich Nixan: how do i know the button is activated.. meaning its connected, as no one the cables says "this is for the back button" you know?
[2023-08-15T21:35:50] Jedich Nixan: no thats not what i mean
[2023-08-15T21:36:22] Jedich Nixan: there is no extra cable from the spiny that tells you "this cable is for back button"
[2023-08-15T21:37:40] Jedich Nixan: ahh okay thats good
[2023-08-15T21:37:54] Jedich Nixan: may i ask you where u from?
[2023-08-15T21:38:02] Jedich Nixan: n1

[2023-08-15T21:38:32] Jedich Nixan: as many ppl here are
[2023-08-15T21:47:30] Happy Giraffe: Anyone tried 3Shul vescs?üò≥
[2023-08-15T22:09:15] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Connect your SPINY throttle directly to VESC and use the newest script for VESC 6.05 and disable software-adc (change variable software-adc from 1 to 0). Anything else stays the same shown here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX8PsaxfoXQ
[2023-08-15T22:10:34] Jedich Nixan: Thx. As soon im ready for it I will let you know.
[2023-08-15T22:11:09] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Ok
[2023-08-15T22:15:35] Happy Giraffe: Interesting, I would prefer a store inside EU to avoid paying tax and duty tho...
[2023-08-15T22:21:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: 72500 with stock motor?üòÇ
[2023-08-15T22:23:01] Jakub Szczypi√≥r: Yes, 75100 and stock motors

[2023-08-15T22:23:42] Jedich Nixan: You can talk with the seller, they could declare it with lower prices
[2023-08-15T22:23:51] Jedich Nixan: I did this with spintend
[2023-08-15T22:24:16] Jakub Szczypi√≥r: Overheating only when going full throttle for like 30-45min in hot weather
[2023-08-15T22:24:36] Jakub Szczypi√≥r: And torque is insane, i won drag race with nami burn e
[2023-08-15T22:24:38] Jakub Szczypi√≥r: üòÅ
[2023-08-15T22:27:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: 75100 isn‚Äôt 72500 Xd

[2023-08-16T11:03:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: my UI is designed primary for desktop. too much info for a mobile üòÖ
[2023-08-16T11:07:23] Oreo huzky: How far is my cl350?
[2023-08-16T11:07:40] Face de Pin Suc√©: Punished?
[2023-08-16T11:07:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: Should be ready by the end of the week ;) dealing many subjects all at once
[2023-08-16T11:11:50] Oreo huzky: Ah okay no Problem
[2023-08-16T11:12:21] Oreo huzky: And thanks for the response
[2023-08-16T11:21:47] Happy Giraffe: Isnt it rated much less the 350?, Oh nvm its rated 200A battüòÇ I watched their old video where they burned one with 220-240A
[2023-08-16T12:46:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Make lot videos pls
[2023-08-16T12:56:32] Face de Pin Suc√©: Old one were rated 150A battery Now they are rated 200A battery
[2023-08-16T13:10:36] Unknown: Number One üòéüî•
[2023-08-16T13:21:13] Happy Giraffe: I expect thermal performance to be great?üòÅ It's everything needed in the package like power button etc?
[2023-08-16T13:21:44] Face de Pin Suc√©: Thermal performance are great
[2023-08-16T13:22:21] Face de Pin Suc√©: No power button, only main logic connector with pins and you have to make your wires We are working on a harness, but will be extra euros ^^
[2023-08-16T13:22:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: IMU and BLE integrated (BLE using ESP32 with password)
[2023-08-16T13:23:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: And 12V3A power supply integrated too
[2023-08-16T13:35:45] Happy Giraffe: Damn, if you have a complete package later on I will order it from you‚ù§Ô∏è
[2023-08-16T13:36:13] Happy Giraffe: Gotta search a frame first and so on, will build bike next summer I think

[2023-08-16T16:52:31] Rogerio Figueiredo: Nice
[2023-08-16T16:59:53] Happy Giraffe: Im not even sure how I have it setup, how can you unlock it with other device if phone gets smashed etc?
[2023-08-16T17:10:17] AK: It does not, vesc does not know anything about bluetooth at all
[2023-08-16T17:10:29] AK: It just sends uart forever on that one port
[2023-08-16T17:10:52] AK: So you have some fw on the esp doing the password thing
[2023-08-16T17:12:17] AK: Vesc has the option to restrict devices, which are allowed to connect
[2023-08-16T17:12:22] AK: The whole pairing done thing
[2023-08-16T17:12:30] AK: Pretty nice
[2023-08-16T17:12:37] AK: But a password would be nicer
[2023-08-16T17:12:51] AK: I hope benj adds eeprom and bluetooth for us
[2023-08-16T17:12:58] AK: In his reference drawings
[2023-08-16T17:13:40] AK: I'd guess either web interface, or something similar. We have to ask the source, Id be interested myself
[2023-08-16T17:26:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes
[2023-08-16T17:28:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: You click on the BT, when it asks you to pair from android, then you type the password and that's it
[2023-08-16T17:28:46] Face de Pin Suc√©: But in my knowledge you cannot change the password
[2023-08-16T17:34:06] Mirono escooters: Best price quality vesc atm? Vsett 10+ motor, 18s batt, no more then 60/150A
[2023-08-16T17:34:17] Mirono escooters: Turnoff isn't a needed feature but nice enough
[2023-08-16T17:40:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: Maybe spintend 85100 alu?
[2023-08-16T17:40:52] Mirono escooters: Mmm, not super spintend fan
[2023-08-16T17:40:55] Mirono escooters: Could give it a go
[2023-08-16T17:40:59] Mirono escooters: Has to be smol
[2023-08-16T17:43:47] Mirono escooters: Ya
[2023-08-16T17:43:53] Mirono escooters: But not following it

[2023-08-16T17:45:47] Mirono escooters: Tax included
[2023-08-16T17:46:53] Mirono escooters: + ship+ tax?
[2023-08-16T18:15:00] Face de Pin Suc√©: Also, important, included voltage divider for ADC so you use 5V for throttle and brake and don't get the ADC to be floating. Don't need ADC Board
[2023-08-16T18:20:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes

[2023-08-16T21:26:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: funny to see traction control in action !
[2023-08-16T22:10:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 0-70 km/h in 11.7s on a single motor, nice ;) with @SibClimb Leger üòú FYI : those 0-xxx are precise at 300ms.
[2023-08-16T22:10:07] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_9315@16-08-2023_22-10-07.jpg>
[2023-08-16T22:11:35] koxx / Francois Deslandes: full throttle üòú
[2023-08-16T22:13:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and his wheel diameter is pertcly calibrated
[2023-08-16T22:16:32] Face de Pin Suc√©: That was uphill
[2023-08-16T22:17:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ü§£ü§£
[2023-08-16T22:56:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hit and run ! 0-100 km/h in 6.5s with 2xC350 ;) 350A phase on rear motor
[2023-08-16T22:58:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: There‚Äôs dragy test? Because honestly I don‚Äôt trust data recorded by vesc
[2023-08-16T23:04:01] koxx / Francois Deslandes: as you can see, the GPS speed is equal to wheel speed. it's been calibrated. it uses VESC ERPM & GPS.
[2023-08-16T23:04:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but GPS refresh is too slow for that, we have to use wheel speed (much more refreshed)
[2023-08-16T23:05:17] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's 300ms for now, but I am testing a 100ms refresh. so, the 0-xxx speed will be precise at +/-0.1s
[2023-08-16T23:09:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yeah but I still prefer dragy üòÇ and as I know @SibClimb have dragy
[2023-08-16T23:09:45] Face de Pin Suc√©: We all do prefer Dragy x)
[2023-08-16T23:09:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: But this is nice to have this possibility without the dragy
[2023-08-16T23:10:11] Face de Pin Suc√©: And my personal dragy is dead
[2023-08-16T23:12:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you know Dragy doesn't have anything special inside ? just a GPS, accelero/magneto/gyro and a Kalman filter üòÖ
[2023-08-16T23:15:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, power is a bit under-valued vs the vesc report, i have to check why, but i have an idea
[2023-08-16T23:15:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: Software also mates, who work only in one thing it does the job better . Dragy takes care also about slope. Also not all gps module are the same, there‚Äôs some better gps and worse , but I think you know . Just take a phone and compare the result with dragy
[2023-08-16T23:16:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: I seen much guys with 0-100 in 3 seconds

[2023-08-16T23:16:36] Finn: Xt60 for phase?
[2023-08-16T23:16:57] Finn: Interesting
[2023-08-16T23:16:58] Lutz: xt90 x 3 for power plus internal copper bar
[2023-08-16T23:17:08] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 2x CL350 v2, but not with their highest currents
[2023-08-16T23:17:09] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: <photos/photo_9322@16-08-2023_23-17-09.jpg>
[2023-08-16T23:17:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: V3 ? You got picture ?
[2023-08-16T23:18:09] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ye, old ones, i did pictures, you forgot ahah
[2023-08-16T23:18:24] Face de Pin Suc√©: Oh okay
[2023-08-16T23:18:39] Lutz: i know
[2023-08-16T23:18:41] Face de Pin Suc√©: That's because they changed name of V3 to V4 ...
[2023-08-16T23:18:47] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Here @SibClimb
[2023-08-16T23:19:03] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yea, i will install v4 very soon. Its coming
[2023-08-16T23:19:11] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, those are V2 but suddenly they named it V3
[2023-08-16T23:19:19] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Got itüëç
[2023-08-16T23:19:33] koxx / Francois Deslandes: to calibrate wheel vs gps, you need to reach a stable speed with a clear view. then, i've never seen much difference between gps as soon you see enought satellites. anyway, we'll compare it to dragy, but the most important remain on the track ü§£
[2023-08-16T23:19:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: if you use ONLY gps, it's dead
[2023-08-16T23:20:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: That I mean, dragy also is best software for those
[2023-08-16T23:20:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt think every people pay 160‚Ç¨ for it are stupid
[2023-08-16T23:21:47] Lutz: have also solid polymer in the alu housing
[2023-08-16T23:22:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: U know which mosfet it uses?
[2023-08-16T23:22:50] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ye, sec
[2023-08-16T23:23:22] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: AGM025N13LL
[2023-08-16T23:25:01] Lutz: better ripple behavior
[2023-08-16T23:25:18] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: They have lower rds than 150v ones
[2023-08-16T23:25:22] Vladimir: What is this soft???
[2023-08-16T23:25:22] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Thats the reason
[2023-08-16T23:25:48] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But ye, its pretty enough
[2023-08-16T23:28:05] Lutz: Radial polymer solid capacitors: Ultra-low ESRs, high ripple current, and temperature resistance ;)
[2023-08-16T23:28:24] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Even for 400A phase when accelerates the do have a little headroom with 2-3v of current switching ripples when emf and bemf sums. But very depends on motor parameters
[2023-08-16T23:28:47] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Regen agree, cant do very strong
[2023-08-16T23:30:12] Jan: Looks great, temps a bit fast moving
[2023-08-16T23:30:39] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Too low voltage for them
[2023-08-16T23:31:09] Jan: 16s?
[2023-08-16T23:32:03] Jan: rds?
[2023-08-16T23:32:51] Jan: ah
[2023-08-16T23:32:54] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: We used 100v, so better ofc
[2023-08-16T23:33:04] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But in plan 30s, so only 3shul
[2023-08-16T23:33:11] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I really like it
[2023-08-16T23:33:47] Jan: Is there any benefit with 30s over 20s except less sausage cables?
[2023-08-16T23:34:21] Jan: 30s + low kv or 20s + high kv is about the same in the end ?
[2023-08-16T23:34:36] Jan: You can make any setup work more or less efficient enough?
[2023-08-16T23:34:41] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Only cl350. C350 will definitely win here with my 22s right now
[2023-08-16T23:35:24] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: More watts less currents
[2023-08-16T23:35:54] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes
[2023-08-16T23:36:26] Jan: Lets say i have a two motors, one 22x3 windings and 30s and the other 33x2 winding with 20s
[2023-08-16T23:36:50] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: We doing right now for 2 people ninebot g30 with 30s configs and one cl350 per scooter
[2023-08-16T23:37:15] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Speed will be not more than 50-60kmh
[2023-08-16T23:37:30] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Cause of custom motor
[2023-08-16T23:37:31] Jan: So you can do like 24Awg cables everywhere?
[2023-08-16T23:37:40] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: No ofc
[2023-08-16T23:38:09] Jan: Motor heat > controller heat
[2023-08-16T23:38:17] Jan: Motor heat is much harder to deal with
[2023-08-16T23:38:45] Jan: ok
[2023-08-16T23:39:51] Jan: I guess motor saturation is a limit of Power (=U*I) so it doesnt matter?
[2023-08-16T23:40:11] Jan: Higher amps => more eddy currents ?
[2023-08-16T23:40:38] Jan: If you get a 16x4 winding maybe would work
[2023-08-16T23:40:40] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ofc they do
[2023-08-16T23:40:49] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: They have 120v nominal motors
[2023-08-16T23:40:59] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Even more than 30s
[2023-08-16T23:41:46] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: It recommended for balanced work
[2023-08-16T23:41:47] Mirono escooters: Yah you pay me 200‚Ç¨ for one?
[2023-08-16T23:43:25] rosheee: ^^ if more amps then faster @ 80 degrees than kmh
[2023-08-16T23:51:02] Jan: magnet dimension must somehow correlate to the power of the input, else it makes no sense to me. ^^
[2023-08-16T23:51:40] Jan: The bigger the magnets the higher the power limit of the motor
[2023-08-16T23:52:35] Jan: reaction force of the magnetic field of the rotor against the magnetic field of the stator
[2023-08-16T23:52:42] Jan: somehow correlation ^^
[2023-08-16T23:53:19] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: No, because we have good heatsink. The more difference between ambient and heatsink temperature the more it cools. But cmon its cl350, not c350. Its not made for such low voltage. Dont forget that these are higher rds fets
[2023-08-16T23:53:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: I thought they uses Infineon
[2023-08-16T23:54:08] rosheee: ?

[2023-08-16T23:56:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: 1387nC
[2023-08-16T23:57:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is legit to use dis fet for motor drive ?
[2023-08-16T23:58:24] rosheee: but then when 30S + u push max amps + battery amps then u need LS2
[2023-08-16T23:59:22] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: ?

[2023-08-17T20:48:55] Happy Giraffe: I mean it will be 150kmh?
[2023-08-17T20:53:18] Oreo huzky: I think more because 700A phase 300A batt
[2023-08-17T20:54:10] Oreo huzky: It will get so warm
[2023-08-17T20:58:17] Simone: little flipsky 410 ü•∞
[2023-08-17T20:59:06] Simone: 48v battery
[2023-08-17T20:59:17] Oreo huzky: 410?

[2023-08-17T22:32:08] Luis Magalhaes: you paint the disc ? ü§£
[2023-08-17T22:52:23] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I don't know. You are using the correct vesc tool for the ESC?
[2023-08-17T22:52:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Ok
[2023-08-17T22:53:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ho guys anyone know if adc module of spintend works with flipsky?
[2023-08-17T22:59:16] Zak: It works with any vesc and even without vesc
[2023-08-17T23:00:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: Oh now I see, the brake signal goes before to adc module and after to vesc
[2023-08-17T23:00:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: I tought contrary
[2023-08-17T23:09:45] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: the brake script? well, it doesn't write to can devices. 6.05 doesn't change anything about it
[2023-08-17T23:14:12] Jan: And it still brakes well
[2023-08-17T23:22:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, it worksüëç But need external 12v for lights, cause flipsky doesnt have 12v out..
[2023-08-17T23:22:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: It has 12v, but not enough for the power of the board
[2023-08-17T23:23:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think for only directional lights it‚Äôs ok
[2023-08-17T23:24:39] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yea
[2023-08-17T23:24:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: Haha why ?
[2023-08-17T23:25:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I don't know tbh anymore. I'm using 6.05 Beta anyway
[2023-08-17T23:27:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: @kawaiinekololis what was the reason of the mp2 fire work?
[2023-08-17T23:28:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: mine? I hit smth and bend whole heatsink. But it was just the phase
[2023-08-17T23:29:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: So heat sink shorted the board?
[2023-08-17T23:29:11] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes
[2023-08-17T23:29:15] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Well MOSFETs
[2023-08-17T23:29:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: And I did run no brk firmware
[2023-08-17T23:29:39] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: So there was no hw protection to prevent it
[2023-08-17T23:29:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs safe? üíÄ
[2023-08-17T23:30:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Well, until something goes wrong yes.
[2023-08-17T23:30:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: What is now the max current you reached for single board?
[2023-08-17T23:30:45] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I will use brk again on the new boards, I was just too lazy to bother fixing.
[2023-08-17T23:31:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 200A phase, 135A battery (cuz 20S3P). Can't really give you anything insane atm.
[2023-08-17T23:33:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I'm waiting for the changes on v0.41 and then I'll get some new boards :)
[2023-08-17T23:33:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: I wanna see how performs cr micro fet at the extreme conditions

[2023-08-18T01:46:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: There is no cruise control script.
[2023-08-18T01:46:40] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Not from me.
[2023-08-18T01:48:06] Rogerio Figueiredo: Can you make one
[2023-08-18T01:48:10] Rogerio Figueiredo: Will be great
[2023-08-18T03:59:12] Nick: <photos/photo_9326@17-08-2023_05-53-51.jpg>
[2023-08-18T03:59:46] Nick: Does anyone know what this is? It connects to the front wheel axle but I don't see any electronics.
[2023-08-18T04:10:42] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No, I won't make one. If you want cruise control, use the vesc cruise control and trigger it using a dedicated button.
[2023-08-18T04:55:14] Nick: <photos/photo_9333@18-08-2023_04-55-14.jpg>
[2023-08-18T04:56:09] Nick: In trying to buy more of whatever this wire is just wondering if I'm measuring it correctly by the copper or am I supposed to measure the rubber?
[2023-08-18T05:13:50] Nick: I checked it's 7 strands but idk what awg it's too small
[2023-08-18T05:14:30] Nick: I just need to buy more to make the wires longer to get from handlebars to where the ESC will be located
[2023-08-18T05:52:44] Nick: I was able to find a spec sheet online for motorcycle 12v accessories it said to do 16awg or 18 so I bought multicolor of both online in copper
[2023-08-18T05:53:01] Nick: The next thing I have to do is the 8mm bullet connectors
[2023-08-18T05:53:13] Nick: For motor phase to Spintend
[2023-08-18T05:53:28] Nick: Don't suppose you have a tutorial in your bookmarks for that?
[2023-08-18T06:01:29] Thierry: It looks like the speedometer cable.
[2023-08-18T06:08:40] Nick: So every 2 of these I'm assuming is a positive and negative and I combine each into one 8mm bullet?
[2023-08-18T06:08:53] Nick: I only have 3 phase from motor so that does seem eight
[2023-08-18T06:08:55] Nick: Right
[2023-08-18T06:09:09] Nick: <photos/photo_9334@18-08-2023_06-09-09.jpg>
[2023-08-18T06:19:20] Nick: Does it matter which set of phases from the controller go to which wires on the motor?
[2023-08-18T06:28:20] Jason Nelson: You can just reverse the motor in the app
[2023-08-18T06:30:13] Nick: <photos/photo_9335@18-08-2023_06-30-13.jpg>
[2023-08-18T06:30:38] Nick: Okay so I will unsolder the bullets Spintend took and solder the 2 big wires into one bullet
[2023-08-18T06:35:37] AK: Never solder shit in a heatsink, just a full stop no. Unless you want to heat the wrench to 200 C as well as the bullet for proper solder connection
[2023-08-18T06:35:54] AK: Wood or a ceramic tweezer are your best thing
[2023-08-18T06:49:49] AK: I know that you know, but if someone scrolls by and thinks that's a good way to do it, would be a shame :D
[2023-08-18T07:07:27] Nick: <photos/photo_9336@18-08-2023_07-07-27.jpg>
[2023-08-18T07:07:45] Nick: Don't judge me it's my first ever time doing something this advanced
[2023-08-18T07:07:53] Nick: I feel like it's going well
[2023-08-18T07:08:04] Nick: At least the wires are all touching the thingie
[2023-08-18T07:11:08] AK: You will not get a proper solder connection soldering in a massive heatsink
[2023-08-18T07:11:23] AK: It will be brittle due to cooling off too quickly
[2023-08-18T07:12:08] Nick: <photos/photo_9337@18-08-2023_07-12-08.jpg>
[2023-08-18T07:12:20] Nick: It's not pretty but it's solid
[2023-08-18T07:12:59] Nick: If I just heat shrink it is it okay
[2023-08-18T07:19:43] Finn: 50mm spacer bigger then scooter
[2023-08-18T07:20:50] Nick: I'm taking the risk of cutting it shorter to do itnright
[2023-08-18T07:20:59] Nick: <photos/photo_9339@18-08-2023_07-20-59.jpg>

[2023-08-18T07:22:35] Finn: Must be for 20s internal and maybe dual 75100
[2023-08-18T07:22:51] Finn: Didnt figure out how to mount a blade motor to the konyk spacer yet
[2023-08-18T07:28:56] Nick: <photos/photo_9342@18-08-2023_07-28-56.jpg>
[2023-08-18T07:29:14] Nick: Excess of everything but ain't no damn way this will ever have problems now
[2023-08-18T08:01:59] Nick: I ran it back over upside down frontsie backsie should be aok or at least functional. Hopefully it not being perfect doesn't just cause a fire
[2023-08-18T08:02:10] Nick: <photos/photo_9343@18-08-2023_08-02-10.jpg>
[2023-08-18T08:13:27] Nick: Can too much solder material make it not work ?
[2023-08-18T08:14:00] Finn: It will work
[2023-08-18T08:14:09] Finn: But it has more resistance.
[2023-08-18T08:14:27] Finn: 1cm solder has more resistance then 1cm of copper wire
[2023-08-18T08:15:08] AK: No, opposite is the case
[2023-08-18T08:15:42] AK: As long as we speak about the same amount of wire in the connector, adding more material which can conduct electricity will lower resistance
[2023-08-18T08:15:58] AK: If you replace copper by solder, it would be worse
[2023-08-18T08:16:04] Finn: Obviously will solder have more resistamce the wire
[2023-08-18T08:16:05] AK: But you are not replacing
[2023-08-18T08:16:11] Finn: Yes makes sense
[2023-08-18T08:16:30] AK: Yeah, but you dont add resistance
[2023-08-18T08:16:31] Nick: I need maximum amps I've decided in gonna run the hub motor as hard as possible to shorten commute times
[2023-08-18T08:16:42] AK: You remember the formula for parallel resistors?
[2023-08-18T08:16:46] AK: That's what happens
[2023-08-18T08:16:57] Finn: If the purple is solder and the red the wire its obv more resistance
[2023-08-18T08:17:02] Nick: All of my commutes will be in Mexico
[2023-08-18T08:18:27] Nick: In my case it's wire touching the connector and then everything is caked in solder
[2023-08-18T08:18:38] Nick: But it is soaked in so idk
[2023-08-18T08:18:48] Finn: Should be fine
[2023-08-18T08:19:03] Finn: How much amps youre wanna push
[2023-08-18T08:19:12] Finn: Prob 200üòÇ
[2023-08-18T08:19:40] Nick: I'm not sure bad at math. I know I have a 72v motor in this thing so 72v maybe put 60 amp
[2023-08-18T08:20:02] Nick: <photos/photo_9345@18-08-2023_08-20-02.jpg>
[2023-08-18T08:20:11] AK: Yes, but this is not what happens
[2023-08-18T08:20:28] AK: Ill draw later
[2023-08-18T08:21:07] Nick: <photos/photo_9346@18-08-2023_08-21-07.jpg>
[2023-08-18T08:21:36] Nick: It's not actually 500w it got this thing to 70kmh on a lead acid battery so it has to be higher
[2023-08-18T08:23:07] Nick: It's a very common thing here in Canada to sell electric motorcycles as "ebikes" and you can take the limiters off of most of them and they become capable of 70-100 kmh depending on the controller they have
[2023-08-18T08:23:26] Nick: There's one called Armada and rawatron here in BC
[2023-08-18T08:23:51] Nick: I tried she just started trying to sell me a new one lmao
[2023-08-18T08:25:21] Nick: I know this one does 70kmh on the motor it has and that's on a badly maintained lead acid and the stock controller so I'd be happy if I could get 100kmh out of this motor and eventually upgrade to a QS motor with a bigger rear wheel and front wheel
[2023-08-18T08:26:03] Nick: Damn 8:30 you're basically nocturnal at this hr
[2023-08-18T08:27:20] Nick: We will see. It'd be cool to get a wider hub motor and put a fat tire on the back because the rear dropout is huge
[2023-08-18T08:27:31] Nick: <photos/photo_9347@18-08-2023_08-27-31.jpg>
[2023-08-18T08:27:47] Nick: Used to be a moped chassis so I think that space is for a trans
[2023-08-18T12:16:37] Rogerio Figueiredo: Why is dangerous? If know how to use it is not dangerous
[2023-08-18T12:17:36] Rogerio Figueiredo: How can I connect another button? Why not with time like stock xiaomi?
[2023-08-18T12:35:32] Luis Magalhaes: Button is better, just get to speed and click done.
[2023-08-18T12:41:23] Rogerio Figueiredo: I don't want more buttons I want clean

[2023-08-18T12:43:24] AK: He literally does his stuff for free
[2023-08-18T12:44:00] Rogerio Figueiredo: I'm not pressing I'm just giving opinion
[2023-08-18T12:44:04] Rogerio Figueiredo: Take it easy
[2023-08-18T12:44:23] Rogerio Figueiredo: I know it does for free that is why I made a donation
[2023-08-18T12:44:30] Rogerio Figueiredo: üòâ
[2023-08-18T12:51:13] AK: You are the great exception üòò
[2023-08-18T12:51:52] Rogerio Figueiredo: He does a great work
[2023-08-18T12:52:36] Rogerio Figueiredo: He deserves I'm just try to convence him to have a option on code yes or no to have cruise control üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-08-18T14:21:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I am not going to implement cruise control out of multiple reasons. There are two ways to implement such feature. 1. It would be possible to as soon it gets enabled to read the current rpm and continue to set the rpm via set-rpm, BUT this comes with the drawback of not affecting other CAN devices as well as causing issues with ADC. 2. The other way would be to "press" the ADC cruise control button in VESC while CC is enabled, this would be an security risk when we deal with this in Lisp and it gets turned on, but not turned off due to any reason (cable connection loose for example) you would crash into something. It also is not ideal because we have to fake a button press in code, which just does not feel right, as well as when we out of any reason, for example script is not running, did not deteach the cruise control button we get HUGE issues because Cruise Control uses the one of the TX pins for the button and this means it would probably take the display button to enable CC for the time being. @marine_tugah
[2023-08-18T14:22:41] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: This is everything I could of course fix by adding a better CC functionally into VESC itself, this is NOTHING we should do using Lisp but integrate into VESC itself, but I don't have the time and NEED for this feature.
[2023-08-18T14:22:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: useful table btw about how ADC hardware is mapped on different modes @jamessoderstrom
[2023-08-18T14:29:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: That happens quite often. I do most of my work because I need it myself, but most of the time people ask for things I don't need. For example, I'm currently implementing more of the xiaomi protocol to support third-party xiaomi dash displays at someone else's request, and I'm only doing it because they seem to have sent me one of their displays and I don't want to let them down.
[2023-08-18T14:32:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: So please direct your feature requests like cruise control towards VESC itself, not me. I'm only offering the translation layer between VESC and Xiaomi/NineBot, but I'm not willing to implement functionally that VESC could adapt themselves.
[2023-08-18T14:32:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: You can do this by creating an issue on the GitHub: https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/issues @marine_tugah
[2023-08-18T14:33:31] Finn: start speed with adc ü§ì
[2023-08-18T14:33:47] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes for example: https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/issues/642

[2023-08-18T21:12:33] JPPL: Better ubox 85v as 100v will got you more Resistance using only 52v, but is nice vesc! Solid

[2023-08-18T21:51:20] Eric Howat: Should note I plan to run a 60v battery at some point is why I want to stay above a 72v system
[2023-08-18T21:52:21] Eric Howat: Fantastic I‚Äôm placing the order now! I‚Äôll deff need some recommendations on setting it up via Bluetooth the wiring is a cake walk I look forward too it thanks again everyone!
[2023-08-18T21:53:25] Eric Howat: Nah I‚Äôd have to change hubs I can run 60v max (1200w hubs) so I woman be going that far
[2023-08-18T21:53:30] Eric Howat: Won‚Äôt‚Äù
[2023-08-18T21:54:08] Eric Howat: Sweet! I didn‚Äôt know that
[2023-08-18T21:54:43] Happy Giraffe: They run better at 72v, your torque will stay for longerüòÅ
[2023-08-18T21:55:57] Eric Howat: Now you have me thinking lol but I don‚Äôt plan to go that far, I‚Äôve got 700miles on the 52/12ah battery and it has no degradation at all so far
[2023-08-18T21:56:18] Eric Howat: Really doing this to gain control of torque per hub and traction control
[2023-08-18T22:33:41] Eric Howat: Do you have any recommendations on throttles that are compatible?
[2023-08-18T22:34:15] Eric Howat: Looking to keep this thing as simple as possible, run Bluetooth for the controller no Display and just a basic pull or thumb throttle
[2023-08-18T22:37:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: Tells them to buy SmartDisplay üòÅ we have cruise control hehehe
[2023-08-18T22:44:36] Eric Howat: I ride the heck out of it so don‚Äôt want to break things when I wreck (if that ever happens)
[2023-08-19T00:01:39] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Well, like I said, that's functionality that VESC should offer, not the display.
[2023-08-19T00:12:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes but very limited, only via button.
[2023-08-19T00:12:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But it's the safest way.
[2023-08-19T00:14:21] Unknown: High voltage VESC question. So I love my Vesc bikes but I have 3 vehicles that are 250-415v 100-300a and I just got a Tesla motor that has a bad controller. Has anyone made a 400v Vesc yet?

[2023-08-19T00:16:08] Unknown: I don‚Äôt see any reason why it wouldn‚Äôt work.
[2023-08-19T00:16:47] Unknown: My 75/350 works on my car.
[2023-08-19T00:17:03] Unknown: It‚Äôs just slow due to the voltage.
[2023-08-19T00:19:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Axiom is 400v 300A , but I‚Äôm not sure that it is available
[2023-08-19T00:20:21] Unknown: I‚Äôll buy so many of those when they are!
[2023-08-19T00:24:54] Unknown: I‚Äôm literally messaging them now! lol.
[2023-08-19T00:26:03] Unknown: Will do!
[2023-08-19T00:30:18] Unknown: It‚Äôs great. Not even close to its limits. lol. I‚Äôve been working 70 hours a week on other people‚Äôs projects while the monies good.
[2023-08-19T00:34:58] Gabe Enzo: 70 hours is 30 hours when you're doing what you love.
[2023-08-19T03:30:17] Nick: <photos/photo_9353@19-08-2023_03-30-17.jpg>
[2023-08-19T03:30:50] Nick: For 12v. Idk what the old one (copper) is but will this 16awg work for turn signals and stuff?
[2023-08-19T03:30:54] Nick: Or too much resistwnce
[2023-08-19T03:32:09] Nick: I think they're bulbs for now but I'll go LED later on but the wire being too girth won't cause issues?
[2023-08-19T03:33:00] Nick: I did for headlight and tail light yrah
[2023-08-19T03:33:12] Nick: <photos/photo_9354@19-08-2023_03-33-12.jpg>
[2023-08-19T03:33:20] Nick: Headlight thats on order
[2023-08-19T09:52:41] Zak: Those headlights are stupid because they blind oncoming vehicles. They dont have a flat beam
[2023-08-19T09:57:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: There are conversion kits for a lot already,but not by teslaüòÖ Chasis not made for big speeds
[2023-08-19T10:00:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: @PaoloWu is there maybe any chance you could get super73 engine's? Or any that fit that bike ,has 150 dropout ,i believe
[2023-08-19T10:02:33] Simone: if you are not in a hurry I have that of my super73 practically new.
[2023-08-19T10:03:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You maybe plan to sell it?
[2023-08-19T10:03:26] Simone: I'm selling it for sure because I bought a qs273
[2023-08-19T10:03:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I know gang of Londoners rolling and kinda cant buy any just for $$$$$$$ from factory
[2023-08-19T10:04:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: That fits in?
[2023-08-19T10:04:39] Simone: I'll find out when it arrives üòÇüòÇ
[2023-08-19T10:05:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also bunch these ppl dont hack just custom solutions around it ,some has overbuild

[2023-08-19T10:05:55] Simone: if you want it on September 15th it is available
[2023-08-19T12:25:43] rosheee: U can set dat in. Vesc
[2023-08-19T12:29:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes but with button, not automatic
[2023-08-19T12:30:25] rosheee: Just add some code and done
[2023-08-19T14:54:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: Why? With brake it will stop
[2023-08-19T14:54:59] Happy Giraffe: Kinda nice for xiaomi 30kmh speeds. But yeah button activation safest, no accidental activations
[2023-08-19T15:05:59] Mirono escooters: I hate cruise control
[2023-08-19T15:09:09] Gabe Enzo: The entire idea of it makes no sense logically. same as with Regen
[2023-08-19T15:13:27] Mirono escooters: Regen does make sense, but eh
[2023-08-19T15:14:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: Regen is very useful
[2023-08-19T15:15:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: But maybe for us with racing scooter not
[2023-08-19T15:17:57] Gabe Enzo: Why have auto brake when you have a brake
[2023-08-19T15:18:01] Gabe Enzo: Imagine that in a car
[2023-08-19T15:18:12] Gabe Enzo: Yea
[2023-08-19T15:19:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Regen means e-brake power regenerate energy , not auto brake
[2023-08-19T15:19:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: You are taking about kers
[2023-08-19T15:20:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: But even this, cars has it
[2023-08-19T15:54:38] Gabe Enzo: I get you, some people just call auto brake Regen.
[2023-08-19T15:54:49] Gabe Enzo: electrics only
[2023-08-19T15:55:37] Mirono escooters: Theoretically it is also
[2023-08-19T16:00:10] Luis Magalhaes: The called one pedal drive üòÇ
[2023-08-19T16:00:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: No, also cars can set kers, that when you release throttle it brakes automatically
[2023-08-19T16:00:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yeah
[2023-08-19T16:13:20] Eric Howat: Hey guys does anyone have / know of a write up for converting reed switch brakes to use a hall sensor for regen braking?
[2023-08-19T16:17:12] Mirono escooters: No possible
[2023-08-19T16:17:14] Mirono escooters: Reed switch is 2 wire
[2023-08-19T16:17:25] Mirono escooters: Or you have to glue magnet to it xd
[2023-08-19T16:18:09] Eric Howat: That‚Äôs what I was figuring just wondering if anyone has any idea on how to do that
[2023-08-19T16:25:03] Happy Giraffe: Best get another throttle for regen
[2023-08-19T16:25:19] Happy Giraffe: Then can stop using that only
[2023-08-19T16:25:42] Eric Howat: I never even thought of that! Good thing I ordered two throttles already haha thanks for the idea!
[2023-08-19T16:27:09] Happy Giraffe: You will love it, not wasting energy that much and brake pads wont wear out
[2023-08-19T16:28:09] Eric Howat: Oh yeah that‚Äôs forsure. I already use max regen on the stock controllers but it‚Äôs simply on / off so having it variable will be beautiful
[2023-08-19T16:28:14] Mirono escooters: I love throttle for regen too
[2023-08-19T17:13:31] AK: Well you need a hall sensor, which will fit instead, and connect it to power
[2023-08-19T17:32:14] rosheee: <photos/photo_9355@19-08-2023_17-32-14.jpg>
[2023-08-19T17:57:45] Konstantin: Same....
[2023-08-19T17:58:25] Mihail: Regen throttle is the way to go, very convenient and makes long descents very easy and efficient. Also super useful when going down on ramps. I've set 100A phase and14A battery on each motor + added brake curve to make regen control very precise
[2023-08-19T18:17:13] Happy Giraffe: AK doesnt like regen throttleüòÇ
[2023-08-19T18:22:46] Mirono escooters: ü•≤
[2023-08-19T18:23:03] Mirono escooters: I'll use regen when my torque arms are properly attached, BCS my Puch is too heavy to rely on 1 drum
[2023-08-19T18:28:48] Gabe Enzo: One wheelers are so gay man
[2023-08-19T18:29:22] Mirono escooters: And stupidly dangerous
[2023-08-19T19:44:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: They have no idea what they talking about
[2023-08-19T19:44:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Common issue with ppl
[2023-08-19T19:45:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I mean some are dumb Some even a problem when they just say something üòÖüôà
[2023-08-19T19:46:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also join just crash channel,thats fun In a way
[2023-08-19T20:36:55] Happy Giraffe: Who even wants a onewheel to start with?üòÇ Im stepping up the bullying level
[2023-08-19T22:42:07] Jonas: Today I did a first test ride with my g30 max and the Xiaomi ble mod. Everything works fine except as soon as I press torque it starts stuttering giving me error code 4 on display and abs error in vesc. Somebody has an idea why that happens? 60v 60a battery Used just a 2k ohm resistor nothing else could that be the problem? Motor is from AliExpress (but if calibrated should not matter except faulty motor ofc) If I press torque just a little bit I can get to around 25kmh.
[2023-08-19T22:42:27] Jonas: On 75100 mks
[2023-08-19T22:52:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: Send motor link
[2023-08-20T01:02:15] rosheee: is it cuz le "german mod"?
[2023-08-20T01:02:28] rosheee: and maybe not changed other parameterZ?
[2023-08-20T01:12:01] Oreo huzky: Anyone knows something about ant bms it‚Äôs beeping like crazy and show‚Äôs completely wrong voltage

[2023-08-20T02:25:16] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: it means bms broken or what
[2023-08-20T02:27:37] Oreo huzky: Idk this happened before battery rebuild cells disconnected and this happened now cells connected good but still this error i think bms needs like complete reset but i don‚Äôt know how
[2023-08-20T02:28:41] Oreo huzky: I think mosfet broken because it give charge and discharge error
[2023-08-20T02:41:56] Oreo huzky: All mosfets are good
[2023-08-20T03:29:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: Did you tried to reset?

[2023-08-20T03:55:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think it‚Äôs basically motor saturation
[2023-08-20T03:55:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: But lol, that‚Äôs not Ly motor
[2023-08-20T03:56:13] Jonas: Just bought it because I had like nothing else and it was here in 4 days..
[2023-08-20T06:52:45] AK: I don't don't like it, I just think it's a dangerous thing having two ways to brake tbh
[2023-08-20T06:53:23] AK: As in when you have that one situation, where you have to brake no matter the cost, pressing even the normal brake takes a second and often costs lives
[2023-08-20T06:54:34] AK: If you have two ways in which you brake, you will have an additional split second on top in best case where you think which one to press
[2023-08-20T06:55:24] AK: And that is the best case, worst case is you won't even think, but will press the wrong one, since regen would be your normal "good times" brake
[2023-08-20T06:55:59] AK: I consider myself to be too unreliable to have two separate brakes with two different hand movements to do
[2023-08-20T06:56:46] AK: <video_file>
[2023-08-20T06:57:25] AK: And you don't even have to go fast to get these situations
[2023-08-20T07:03:18] Eric Howat: I had a car turn left quickly in front of me the other day and the only thing that saved me was regen (activated by mechanical brake lever) while I was going 35mph. I agree I would never run a two way brake/throttle.
[2023-08-20T08:34:27] Mihail: Ive had situations when fast braking was necessary, I press both regen and front brake. Rear wheel starts to skid from regen+front brake. I don't even bother having mechanical brake on the rear.
[2023-08-20T08:34:45] AK: I am not saying regen = bad
[2023-08-20T08:35:01] AK: I am saying 2 ways to toggle brakes = bad
[2023-08-20T08:35:16] AK: Regen is based
[2023-08-20T08:38:38] Mihail: I prefer having regen separated from mechanical. On xiaomi they are combined into one lever and I find that very unpleasant. When going downhill the mechanical brake still engages and wastes energy + brake pads.
[2023-08-20T08:39:06] Gabe Enzo: You can add another lever ez
[2023-08-20T08:39:08] AK: Well, and I do not, I find it the best way :D
[2023-08-20T08:39:36] Mihail: Exactly what I did, but a thumb trottle
[2023-08-20T10:39:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: Well, as I have been in this situation multiple times, brain is automatic, it doesn't think of which one, it knows where to press automatically hehe
[2023-08-20T11:02:36] Happy Giraffe: I only use regen for slowing down when I already decided when to brake before, not for emergency brake. This way I will never mix them up and keep hand on hydraulic brakes
[2023-08-20T11:03:09] Oreo huzky: How
[2023-08-20T11:03:25] AK: It all boils down to "I don't wear a helmet because I am a careful driver"
[2023-08-20T11:03:39] AK: Sure, until you don't need to wear one anyways
[2023-08-20T11:03:58] Happy Giraffe: Haha, yeah and if someone decides to hit you they will
[2023-08-20T13:55:48] Mihail: That would be me, Ive tried a full-face helmet but it restricts my field of view, especially vertical. Bike helmets don't have this issues but seem pretty useless. So I try my best not to crash. One of the reasons I ordered Ninebot f40 to replace my m365 pro, since fatigue makes them snap and I have to make sure that can't happen. Till then I ride vsett 10 exclusively, I haven't seen any broken vsett 10s
[2023-08-20T14:25:33] Happy Giraffe: Leatt DH 1.0 is perfect for me. Found a deal online for 55‚Ç¨
[2023-08-20T14:27:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: F40 Even pole bends
[2023-08-20T14:27:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Was not a good ideaüòÖ
[2023-08-20T14:28:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Not fullface worthless in our business,be safe
[2023-08-20T14:28:35] Mihail: Pole is aluminum
[2023-08-20T14:28:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And
[2023-08-20T14:28:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Still bends
[2023-08-20T14:29:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Stand on it and try
[2023-08-20T14:29:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Dont need to believe me
[2023-08-20T14:29:14] Mihail: Im not worried about it, im careful with it.
[2023-08-20T14:29:31] Mihail: 45¬∞ pipe is what worries ne on the xiaomi
[2023-08-20T14:30:41] Mihail: Also, how can it bend when it is aluminum, wouldn't it snap instead?
[2023-08-20T15:01:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Since its long bends Whole shit is weaker And you will love how they made engine wire over the tubes üòÖ
[2023-08-20T15:02:57] Oreo huzky: Could resetting ant bms over pc fix this problem ?
[2023-08-20T19:26:14] Mihail: <photos/photo_9357@20-08-2023_19-26-14.jpg>
[2023-08-20T19:27:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I know how does it look ,and that's we dont sell it üòÖ
[2023-08-20T19:27:13] Mihail: Yes strange decision to drill the pipe to hold the wire
[2023-08-20T19:27:40] Mihail: I dont find it bad looking, just odd decision
[2023-08-20T19:28:29] Mihail: I find the f series better looking than m365 and g30, personal preference
[2023-08-20T19:40:13] Mirono escooters: Waaaaaa deee
[2023-08-20T19:40:25] Mirono escooters: Maybe looks, but functionality or quality ü•≤
[2023-08-20T22:05:42] Eric Howat: Random question of the day, what do you think I can pull mph wise out of a ubox v2 75v 100ax2 on 1200w hubs with a 52v18ah?
[2023-08-20T22:06:42] Jan: What cells?
[2023-08-20T22:07:55] Eric Howat: I haven‚Äôt opened it up is the factory Panasonic battery 14 cells not sure of which cells yet haven‚Äôt gotten that far lol
[2023-08-20T22:08:46] Eric Howat: I think it‚Äôs 18650s
[2023-08-20T22:10:55] Jan: The single cell max discharge value will determine everything. Else no one can know
[2023-08-20T22:12:06] Jan: Lets say you got good cells with 10A max discharge eacg
[2023-08-20T22:13:16] Jan: You got around 2600W max discharge
[2023-08-20T22:13:38] Jan: So maybe 60-70kph
[2023-08-20T22:14:45] Jan: Converted to freedom units about 37-43mph
[2023-08-20T22:15:57] Jan: 50A most bms should handle i guess?
[2023-08-20T22:16:10] Eric Howat: That‚Äôs kind of what I figured. Not sure which battery is in this specific one I still have to open it up
[2023-08-20T22:16:17] Jan: Probably 6p
[2023-08-20T22:16:35] Eric Howat: They used quite a few variants it looks like and I forget what it was when I had it open years ago lol
[2023-08-20T22:17:15] Jan: 18Ah with 3000mAh cells maybe
[2023-08-20T22:18:26] Jan: Would make 70A possible
[2023-08-20T22:32:39] Eric Howat: It‚Äôs a varla eagle one so zero10x clone
[2023-08-20T22:34:41] Eric Howat: Could be, I‚Äôve read so much conflicting info I‚Äôll have to wait until I open it up when the vesc comes in probably 3weeks
[2023-08-20T22:34:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: Now they call everything Panasonic
[2023-08-20T22:35:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: All Chinese scooter from Banggood
[2023-08-20T22:35:10] Eric Howat: Haha
[2023-08-20T22:35:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: They got failed or used 21700 cells from Tesla then call it Panasonic
[2023-08-20T22:35:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is 21700?
[2023-08-20T22:36:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Nami I think uses real 18650
[2023-08-20T22:36:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: But first batch was scam
[2023-08-20T22:36:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: 2900mAh cells
[2023-08-20T22:36:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: When I meet Micheal at china he said after changed company , no more fake battery comes
[2023-08-20T23:24:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 0-100 in 5.9s with stock dualtron motors. he lost 200ms due to lack of halls üòÖ
[2023-08-20T23:26:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: funny how front motor reaaaaallly work less than rear (look at phase currents)
[2023-08-20T23:27:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: clear blue vs purple
[2023-08-20T23:27:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: funny how front motor reaaaaallly work less than rear (look at phase currents)
[2023-08-20T23:32:56] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yeah ;)
[2023-08-20T23:33:32] koxx / Francois Deslandes: he will soon change for Rage motors ... with halls. we'll see the difference ;)
[2023-08-20T23:34:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: don't remember üòÖ
[2023-08-20T23:34:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: VSS ?
[2023-08-20T23:35:04] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I know HFI, but what is VSS ?
[2023-08-20T23:36:34] koxx / Francois Deslandes: interesting ! we tried HFI a bit, but too difficult to setup for good startup torque
[2023-08-20T23:38:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: dear god, I missed that !
[2023-08-20T23:39:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: less parameters also means easier to setup. cool !
[2023-08-20T23:39:49] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_9362@20-08-2023_23-39-49.jpg>
[2023-08-20T23:53:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ok üëç
[2023-08-20T23:54:13] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and start voltage ?
[2023-08-21T01:31:48] Luis Magalhaes: Traction controll?
[2023-08-21T01:33:58] Luis Magalhaes: 20s battery?
[2023-08-21T01:38:17] Gabe Enzo: Imagine using anything under 20s
[2023-08-21T01:38:24] Gabe Enzo: 20 is the magic number
[2023-08-21T01:38:56] Gabe Enzo: Yes 2600w is 70kmh
[2023-08-21T01:39:33] Gabe Enzo: If Ur light. Fatasses don't get the pass
[2023-08-21T01:40:28] Gabe Enzo: Hubs? plural?
[2023-08-21T01:42:39] Luis Magalhaes: I use 16S üòÇ but 20S is more fun true
[2023-08-21T01:46:41] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Better to brake than fly at bug speed
[2023-08-21T04:51:15] Nick: I see a lot of 48v motorcycle and Ebike online. I'm wondering how are they getting speeds up to 80kmh? I thought 48v wouldn't be enough
[2023-08-21T04:57:07] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: High KV motor but very high current amp
[2023-08-21T05:20:26] Nick: Idk much about electricity so the voltage doesn't matter so much as the amps?
[2023-08-21T05:23:53] Unknown: Like a bicycle in high gear it goes fast but you have to pedal real hard.
[2023-08-21T05:40:14] Nick: So my motor if it's 72v I'd have 7200rpm at the wheel?
[2023-08-21T05:40:33] Nick: So basically more top end power right?
[2023-08-21T05:40:59] Nick: I see a lot of 48v pitbikes but they look fast so it must all be in the first 2 gears or something
[2023-08-21T05:42:06] Eric Howat: Yeah two 1200w hubs just the stands 10‚Äù scooter hubs most platforms use
[2023-08-21T05:42:13] Eric Howat: Standard‚Äù
[2023-08-21T07:48:36] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes
[2023-08-21T07:48:48] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes
[2023-08-21T08:24:01] Luis Magalhaes: <sticker>
[2023-08-21T11:01:16] Happy Giraffe: Or a high kv motor
[2023-08-21T11:02:10] Gabe Enzo: No KV equates to rpm. If you have a 3000kv motor then each volt you add will increase rpm by 3000 (in a no load simulation)
[2023-08-21T11:11:23] Nick: Is there a way to get the kV of the motor using vesc tool? I know it's probably over 3kw but idk the kV
[2023-08-21T11:31:17] Gabe Enzo: No. Only way is by using a low frame camera. Or contacting the producer.
[2023-08-21T11:31:35] Gabe Enzo: hall sensors don't measure RPM to my knowledge
[2023-08-21T11:32:00] Nick: Is it something I need or can I just dump amps into it until it gets hot and then dial it down a bit?
[2023-08-21T11:32:22] sombre_enfant: U can do this
[2023-08-21T11:32:24] Gabe Enzo: To be honest just dump amps into it. feel the motor after each stop light.
[2023-08-21T11:32:56] Nick: I'm assuming if it's hot enough to burn windings it'll burn my hand easily right?
[2023-08-21T11:32:59] Gabe Enzo: Motors are rated on KW based on 24/7 usage, therefore it's usual to triple the kw rating.
[2023-08-21T11:33:10] Gabe Enzo: Yes
[2023-08-21T11:33:39] Gabe Enzo: but not always
[2023-08-21T11:33:44] Nick: Mine is wierd it's from a motoring xmb it's technically 500w minimum but peaks somewhere between 3kw and 6kw since stock it could do 70kmh
[2023-08-21T11:34:06] Nick: <photos/photo_9346@18-08-2023_08-21-07.jpg>
[2023-08-21T11:34:15] Nick: <photos/photo_9347@18-08-2023_08-27-31.jpg>
[2023-08-21T11:34:21] Gabe Enzo: yeah my motor is 300w and it can easily pull 3kw and today I'll be trying 4kw. as long as it's in short bursts its entirely safe for long term.
[2023-08-21T11:34:40] Gabe Enzo: Police getaway mode will have 50A 72V
[2023-08-21T11:34:46] Gabe Enzo: like 5kw
[2023-08-21T11:35:05] Nick: Haha my police mode is gonna limit me to 32kmh and put blues clues on a screen on the gas tank to make me look innoceny
[2023-08-21T11:35:45] Gabe Enzo: can't wait to use my scooter today. almost done with it. 36 hours of work in. Room is a mess
[2023-08-21T11:35:46] Nick: I would be stoked if I could get like 10kw out of this thing. I want to have it fast enough that it frightens me.
[2023-08-21T11:35:53] Nick: What kind of scoot
[2023-08-21T11:35:55] Gabe Enzo: it'll melt.
[2023-08-21T11:36:00] Gabe Enzo: Xiaomi pro 2.
[2023-08-21T11:36:25] Gabe Enzo: I think @kawaiinekololis said he can pull 10kw from a 3kw and I don't think he goes further, even tho his batt is well capable.
[2023-08-21T11:36:43] Nick: I'm hoping it's related to size also because my motor is huge
[2023-08-21T11:36:55] Nick: 12in motor I think not counting the tyre
[2023-08-21T11:37:19] Gabe Enzo: I use 8.5inch tyres and reach 70 lmfao
[2023-08-21T11:37:27] Gabe Enzo: Think I can do 85 today
[2023-08-21T11:37:49] Nick: Meet the Lord any% speedrun
[2023-08-21T11:38:22] Gabe Enzo: yep
[2023-08-21T11:38:24] Nick: 85 is nuts on 8.5in tires I was scared going 80 on my vsett 10
[2023-08-21T11:38:31] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_9365@21-08-2023_11-38-31.jpg>
[2023-08-21T11:39:00] Nick: What a sleeper build tho lol
[2023-08-21T11:39:03] Gabe Enzo: been in so many near death scenario's that I assume I'm immortal
[2023-08-21T11:39:22] Gabe Enzo: You know whats up hehe
[2023-08-21T11:39:48] Gabe Enzo: I enjoy passing people on those shitty expensive "fast" scooters
[2023-08-21T11:39:57] Gabe Enzo: Its hilarious
[2023-08-21T11:40:18] Gabe Enzo: the stock ones with the fat tyres
[2023-08-21T11:40:27] Nick: I passed a Harley once and. The guy was so mad he down shifted and I could smell his burning oil all the way up the street
[2023-08-21T11:40:48] Gabe Enzo: only a few more years till electric goes total Mainstream.
[2023-08-21T11:41:30] Gabe Enzo: Yeah gassers have a burning hatred towards E
[2023-08-21T11:41:38] Nick: Those things barely move compared to electric I was bullying the poor guy in his first and second gears and half of 3rd
[2023-08-21T11:41:39] Gabe Enzo: They can't comprehend
[2023-08-21T11:41:57] Gabe Enzo: apparently no sound = shit
[2023-08-21T11:42:09] Nick: Our things make way cooler noises
[2023-08-21T11:42:14] Gabe Enzo: which is a lie, they do make sound
[2023-08-21T11:42:16] Gabe Enzo: IKR
[2023-08-21T11:42:31] Gabe Enzo: Indeed
[2023-08-21T11:43:12] Nick: I wanna get a gear drive skateboard once this motorbike is built completely so I can cruise around the beach. I miss gear drive noises
[2023-08-21T12:11:10] Finn: Thats a sleeper
[2023-08-21T12:14:01] Gabe Enzo: Nope it has a bag
[2023-08-21T12:14:19] Finn: Still drives 60kmh
[2023-08-21T12:44:55] Happy Giraffe: Erpm and calculate from there
[2023-08-21T12:49:05] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: For an approximate understanding: check that pole pairs of the motor set right. Look for erpms on max freewheel speed. Divide erpms by number of the pole pairs. You get rpms. Divide these rpms by your actual battery voltage under freewheel load. You will get approximate kv there
[2023-08-21T12:50:09] Finn: So when my motor got 30000erp and divide that by 30 motor poles i got 1000rpm?
[2023-08-21T12:50:29] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Not poles, but pole pairs. 15, not 30
[2023-08-21T12:50:35] Finn: oh
[2023-08-21T12:50:41] Finn: so 2000
[2023-08-21T12:50:45] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yep
[2023-08-21T12:50:55] Finn: so arround 28kv?
[2023-08-21T12:50:59] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Maybe
[2023-08-21T12:51:06] Finn: for the 1200 blade motor?
[2023-08-21T12:51:10] Finn: idk if that can fit
[2023-08-21T12:51:26] Finn: i will calculate that later when im home
[2023-08-21T13:15:53] Mirono escooters: Sounds correct
[2023-08-21T13:22:48] Happy Giraffe: Yes
[2023-08-21T13:50:32] Happy Giraffe: Saw this being sold on the marketplace. Look closely and you see whats wrongüòÇ
[2023-08-21T13:52:38] Mirono escooters: Waa de
[2023-08-21T14:01:50] Happy Giraffe: Guy didnt know about pipe clamps existance
[2023-08-21T14:08:09] Alex: Hi guys
[2023-08-21T14:08:36] Alex: Is there anyone who knows what does mean when the adc is constantly beeping?
[2023-08-21T14:10:56] Alex: It looks that you dont have one of them. I was have a king gt pro but its a piece of shit. Electrical and mechanical issues on every week
[2023-08-21T14:50:44] Happy Giraffe: What do you mean?üò≥
[2023-08-21T14:50:56] Mirono escooters: Vesc time
[2023-08-21T14:51:13] Happy Giraffe: I take Stark Varg over that
[2023-08-21T14:51:21] Finn: zero motorcycles
[2023-08-21T14:51:59] Finn: I Really want to get one as soon as i got enough money for the license
[2023-08-21T14:52:50] Happy Giraffe: How much?
[2023-08-21T14:53:12] Happy Giraffe: If 20k‚Ç¨ , Kawasaki H2 has entered the chatüòÇ
[2023-08-21T14:53:39] Mirono escooters: No idea

[2023-08-21T14:56:11] Alex: <video_file>
[2023-08-21T14:56:17] Happy Giraffe: That comes from a vesc?
[2023-08-21T14:56:28] Alex: From the adc
[2023-08-21T14:57:13] Happy Giraffe: Interesting, I have no idea
[2023-08-21T15:06:36] Unknown: You painted an 11 black?
[2023-08-21T15:11:43] Finn: How tf you dont get wobble?
[2023-08-21T15:12:04] Finn: Is it all because of the handle bar?
[2023-08-21T15:20:00] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: He is protected by jesus powa
[2023-08-21T15:21:22] Finn: if you put one foot on that scooter you need that anyway
[2023-08-21T15:30:48] Alex: Its a vsett11+
[2023-08-21T15:33:10] Alex: Yes
[2023-08-21T15:33:26] Alex: The adc is constantly beeping and the can doesnt work
[2023-08-21T15:33:46] Alex: I tried to change the uart cable
[2023-08-21T15:33:51] Alex: Bur not that was it

[2023-08-21T15:52:17] Alex: So is there anyone who has solve for my problem?
[2023-08-21T15:52:59] Happy Giraffe: Propably in vsett group
[2023-08-21T15:53:16] Alex: Ohh my god
[2023-08-21T15:53:27] Alex: Why ib vsett group?
[2023-08-21T15:53:46] Alex: Its a vesc controller in it what cant work properly
[2023-08-21T15:54:02] Happy Giraffe: Oh you meant adc adapter board 2.0?ü§î
[2023-08-21T15:54:11] Alex: Yes

[2023-08-21T16:08:24] Alex: Nothing. First just one of the motors gone after it the brake light is flashing when i dont used the brake and after it the adc gone there is every time go the brake and doesnt start and just beeping
[2023-08-21T16:09:08] Alex: Yeah before it worked
[2023-08-21T16:09:25] Alex: Can you send a video how can i correctly reflash?
[2023-08-21T16:09:35] Alex: I updated the vesc
[2023-08-21T16:09:40] Alex: It can be the problem?

[2023-08-21T17:27:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: Amazing, now he has my respect üî•
[2023-08-21T17:30:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Honestly I never thought mantis can be stable like that, considering that he‚Äôs without steering damper
[2023-08-21T17:30:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: I had 3 mantis but sold all
[2023-08-21T17:31:12] Face de Pin Suc√©: I made 24S7P 40T long time ago in Mantis
[2023-08-21T17:31:21] Face de Pin Suc√©: Didn't have any camera or gps or whatever
[2023-08-21T17:31:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: Never knew which speed reached x)
[2023-08-21T17:31:38] Face de Pin Suc√©: But was very stable
[2023-08-21T17:38:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: <video_file>
[2023-08-21T17:39:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: Only video I have from this amazing Mantis üò≠

[2023-08-21T17:39:45] Face de Pin Suc√©: Pushing 24S battery in it
[2023-08-21T17:40:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, pretty scary x)
[2023-08-21T17:41:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: Back this time, this was YYK üòÇ
[2023-08-21T17:41:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: I was playing also with Kelly's
[2023-08-21T17:41:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: But not for 24S
[2023-08-21T17:42:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: And had my first experiences with VESC hahaha
[2023-08-21T17:43:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: Square wave sound
[2023-08-21T17:48:04] Face de Pin Suc√©: Not really, nothing above 12S
[2023-08-21T17:48:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: Or BESC
[2023-08-21T18:01:54] Oreo huzky: How is the phone still holding on
[2023-08-21T18:11:31] JPPL: Imagine hit you in the face üòÇüòÇüôè
[2023-08-21T18:13:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: For such voltage need Igbt and total different circuit, until you‚Äôve high request that‚Äôs don‚Äôt worth because need huge investment
[2023-08-21T18:21:13] JPPL: Obvious
[2023-08-21T18:21:14] puneDir: vesc powered citroen ami
[2023-08-21T18:21:21] puneDir: (20s)
[2023-08-21T18:21:24] JPPL: There's no open source car management tunning
[2023-08-21T18:22:08] JPPL: Vesc is solution for everything that spins, should be more developed
[2023-08-21T18:28:16] puneDir: Any suggestion for ev car esc?
[2023-08-21T18:28:27] puneDir: atleast 30s and 150a

[2023-08-21T18:34:23] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ye, better rise voltage and stay same or lower currents
[2023-08-21T18:34:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes 30S too low but
[2023-08-21T18:34:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: 30S 700A is like 75KW
[2023-08-21T18:35:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: You put 4 and you have 200KW
[2023-08-21T18:35:48] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Perfect for golf e-car
[2023-08-21T18:35:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: But I don't want to be the one who put the battery wires x)
[2023-08-21T19:28:53] Eric Howat: Anyone know average shipping time from Spintend?
[2023-08-21T19:38:05] JPPL: 1 week 10 days I would say
[2023-08-21T19:38:34] Eric Howat: Oh sweet. I ordered Friday just wanted to know how much time I have to get ready for install üòÇ little eager to do some wiring
[2023-08-21T19:38:45] JPPL: I have 2/3 tracking
[2023-08-21T19:38:49] JPPL: Qait
[2023-08-21T19:39:13] Eric Howat: What‚Äôs 2/3 tracking lol
[2023-08-21T19:40:33] JPPL: Orders I made
[2023-08-21T19:40:39] JPPL: One of them 4 days
[2023-08-21T19:41:11] JPPL: Other 6 days

[2023-08-21T19:42:48] JPPL: So max 1 week, all fedex
[2023-08-21T19:56:15] Basti: Hello how to connect a voltmeter with flipsky 74100 can anyone help me please
[2023-08-21T20:38:02] pnn: anyone has suggested motor settings for a Ubox 75V100Ax2 J? running 2 "3000W" motors from Maike, with a 16S battery (max discharge 70A)
[2023-08-21T20:38:41] pnn: that's the scooter brand, and their motor are branded Maike as well
[2023-08-21T20:39:02] pnn: <photos/photo_9372@21-08-2023_20-39-02.jpg>
[2023-08-21T20:39:49] pnn: 13 actually
[2023-08-21T20:40:04] pnn: yeah, that what the battery says.
[2023-08-21T20:40:12] pnn: max discharge: 70A
[2023-08-21T20:41:11] pnn: originally scooter had 2 45A controllers, so I guess it can do better than 70
[2023-08-21T20:41:37] pnn: it also has 2 XT60 outputs instead of 1, so maybe it's per output?
[2023-08-21T20:42:39] pnn: used to be able to reach ~75kph with original controllers. with defualt settings after running FOC wizard on my ubox, I'm barely reaching 25 kph
[2023-08-21T20:46:16] pnn: settings I got from FOC wizard: battery amps were set to 84, motor amps to 50 and abs max to 100
[2023-08-21T20:46:51] pnn: can this Ubox handle 140 motor amps? is the 100A rating for battery amps?
[2023-08-21T20:46:59] pnn: I'll try it!
[2023-08-21T20:48:49] pnn: yeah that makes sense. I've seen post of people getting 8kW+ out of this Ubox
[2023-08-21T20:49:13] pnn: I'll try your suggested settings, appreciate it
[2023-08-21T20:54:20] pnn: yeah, I plan to put thermal pad between ubox and frame
[2023-08-21T20:54:48] pnn: maybe a fan if it helps? I have the pinout for a 12v fan, not sure how much it helps
[2023-08-21T20:55:13] pnn: hahah alright
[2023-08-21T20:56:07] pnn: how reliable are these spintend uboxes? I'm new to vesc, and I've mostly seen Flipskys mentioned
[2023-08-21T20:57:06] pnn: wondering if I made the right choice for a vesc
[2023-08-21T20:59:56] Face de Pin Suc√©: @jamessoderstrom didn't you tell me once that there were troubles with temp sensor on ubox ?
[2023-08-21T21:00:38] JPPL: After water maybe?
[2023-08-21T21:00:48] JPPL: I got it, even turn on button
[2023-08-21T21:00:49] Face de Pin Suc√©: What were the symptoms ?
[2023-08-21T21:01:05] JPPL: Double temp, irregular
[2023-08-21T21:01:23] JPPL: About 74¬∞c mauby this info helps
[2023-08-21T21:01:44] Face de Pin Suc√©: It seems that I have a 1K PTC (when I put my ohmeter it shows 1.7Kohm)
[2023-08-21T21:01:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: But temp does shit
[2023-08-21T21:02:00] Face de Pin Suc√©: Like 90-95¬∞C and when pushing throttle it moves
[2023-08-21T21:02:18] JPPL: Similar behavior then
[2023-08-21T21:02:32] JPPL: It's ahitty because we need to higher value of temps config
[2023-08-21T21:02:43] JPPL: To mantain "normal work"
[2023-08-21T21:02:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: Damn
[2023-08-21T21:03:00] JPPL: Happened only on one spintend
[2023-08-21T21:03:02] Face de Pin Suc√©: So I can't use this type of temp sensor on my motor ?
[2023-08-21T21:04:07] JPPL: I have same motor on other spintend, so double motor
[2023-08-21T21:04:13] JPPL: No temp error problem on one
[2023-08-21T21:04:18] JPPL: Works perfectly
[2023-08-21T21:04:21] JPPL: Other dont
[2023-08-21T21:04:40] JPPL: Ubox 100v single
[2023-08-21T21:04:57] Face de Pin Suc√©: Ubox 80V100A aluminum
[2023-08-21T21:05:14] JPPL: The black square box
[2023-08-21T21:05:19] JPPL: Cooper plate down
[2023-08-21T21:05:41] Simone: ü§îü§î 24s7p inside the deck?
[2023-08-21T21:05:50] JPPL: Can't check it right now. But I use lyhs 75h so I think you know temp sensor
[2023-08-21T21:05:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes with spacer for battery
[2023-08-21T21:06:30] JPPL: This last 145 on mantis was 10/11"? 22s?
[2023-08-21T21:06:33] Face de Pin Suc√©: <photos/photo_9373@21-08-2023_21-06-33.jpg>
[2023-08-21T21:07:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes
[2023-08-21T21:07:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: You think dead temp sensor ?
[2023-08-21T21:07:28] Face de Pin Suc√©: It is inside MXus 3K motor
[2023-08-21T21:07:46] Face de Pin Suc√©: Damnit
[2023-08-21T21:08:05] JPPL: Any water around somehow?
[2023-08-21T21:08:11] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, room temp here
[2023-08-21T21:08:18] Face de Pin Suc√©: Possible, it's customer motor
[2023-08-21T21:08:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: Fuck, too lazy to open this shit motor
[2023-08-21T21:08:44] JPPL: Goes similar with my personal report
[2023-08-21T21:09:17] JPPL: Let's keep rocking! üí™
[2023-08-21T21:09:34] Simone: This mantis have 21s6p and it doesn't have room for a pin...I wish I knew how you got it in üòÖ
[2023-08-21T21:09:54] Simone: 10" 21s

[2023-08-21T21:11:19] JPPL: Stupid or best advice, more safety gear
[2023-08-21T21:11:31] JPPL: I keep upgrading my stuff
[2023-08-21T21:12:19] Face de Pin Suc√©: If only I could find a picture of it ...
[2023-08-21T21:12:39] Face de Pin Suc√©: Oh wait, I know where to look !

[2023-08-21T21:18:39] Face de Pin Suc√©: But this was 24S7P with 40T cells haha
[2023-08-21T21:18:56] Simone: Yes...these powers were not foreseen üòÖü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-08-21T21:19:14] Face de Pin Suc√©: With external BMS damn I remember now hahaha, what a hell of conception to do it right
[2023-08-21T21:19:59] Simone: time bomb? üòÇüòú
[2023-08-21T21:22:46] Simone: it's been a long time since I opened the realtime bms data on my mono 11"...I didn't expect these results and now I'm really uncertain whether to sell them üòÖüòÖ

[2023-08-21T21:24:44] Simone: it would have exceeded 32kw if I had had a full battery but I was on 82 volts instead of 92
[2023-08-21T21:38:13] Simone: Can 22s and 200A of battery be done safely with 3shul or does it reach 80¬∞C?
[2023-08-21T21:38:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: safely yes, for the heat, it's only about your cooling solution
[2023-08-21T21:39:23] Simone: Without mod on heatsink but in front of escooter
[2023-08-21T21:40:14] Simone: Do u have data with 400A battery on yours? Only for watching the temperature
[2023-08-21T21:40:37] Face de Pin Suc√©: not possible, you need heatsink to cool it down
[2023-08-21T21:40:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: will have this weekend, we go to track circuit ;)
[2023-08-21T21:41:31] Simone: Do you have pics of your heatsink?
