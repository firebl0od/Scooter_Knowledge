[2023-08-22T14:09:12] Face de Pin Suc√©: yes, solved it haha, and it was NTC 10k
[2023-08-22T14:19:47] Face de Pin Suc√©: yeah hahaha
[2023-08-22T14:27:51] Mirono escooters: USB otg adaptor and usbc cable for Vesc to phone, works?
[2023-08-22T14:28:01] Mirono escooters: I'm not buying so many Bluetooths anymore
[2023-08-22T14:28:08] Mirono escooters: Or i should bother w esp32 again
[2023-08-22T14:28:28] puneDir: Use esp
[2023-08-22T14:28:33] puneDir: No it doesnt
[2023-08-22T14:28:36] puneDir: I tried
[2023-08-22T14:28:54] Mirono escooters: Fuck
[2023-08-22T14:28:54] Mirono escooters: Oh well
[2023-08-22T14:28:58] Mirono escooters: I have to figure out again how
[2023-08-22T14:31:09] Mirono escooters: The rtg adaptors too expensive
[2023-08-22T14:32:05] Mirono escooters: 60‚Ç¨ Esc 20‚Ç¨ Bluetooth dongl
[2023-08-22T14:32:09] Mirono escooters: If the part is like 2-3‚Ç¨
[2023-08-22T14:32:10] Mirono escooters: Scammers
[2023-08-22T14:32:13] Mirono escooters: I'll make esp32 again
[2023-08-22T14:32:34] Mirono escooters: Can you even change the names? It would be handy on the boat
[2023-08-22T14:32:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: Esp is big
[2023-08-22T14:33:08] Mirono escooters: So?
[2023-08-22T14:33:13] Mirono escooters: Any other alternatives?
[2023-08-22T14:33:26] Mirono escooters: I can use a esp , enough space. Not that humungus
[2023-08-22T14:33:38] puneDir: I can help
[2023-08-22T14:34:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_9384@22-08-2023_14-34-51.jpg>
[2023-08-22T14:36:03] Mirono escooters: Wich is that?
[2023-08-22T14:36:13] Mirono escooters: I like, I need 6-8 So 20‚Ç¨ a PCs is just no go
[2023-08-22T14:36:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: Nrf51
[2023-08-22T14:36:42] Mirono escooters: Rtg or flash
[2023-08-22T15:19:34] AK: You get get the nrfs for that as well
[2023-08-22T15:19:44] Mirono escooters: Nrfs?
[2023-08-22T15:19:47] AK: If you have them accessible
[2023-08-22T15:20:10] AK: .
[2023-08-22T15:25:36] Mirono escooters: O
[2023-08-22T15:25:46] Mirono escooters: Where buy? Like 8
[2023-08-22T15:25:49] Mirono escooters: Best shop dat is
[2023-08-22T15:26:03] Mirono escooters: And they work out of the box? ü•∞
[2023-08-22T15:32:09] AK: Well you obviously flash them
[2023-08-22T15:32:20] AK: Same as with esp/other things
[2023-08-22T15:32:31] AK: But afaik the vesc can do so itself
[2023-08-22T15:32:40] AK: Via the corresponding connector
[2023-08-22T15:32:58] Mirono escooters: Owo
[2023-08-22T15:33:01] Mirono escooters: Even better
[2023-08-22T15:34:34] AK: Well like erry nrf, nothing special there
[2023-08-22T15:34:46] AK: You can flash almost anything, like other vescs etc
[2023-08-22T15:38:38] AK: This is how an stlink works, you have an stm flashing other stms
[2023-08-22T15:39:00] Mirono escooters: I find nrf52832
[2023-08-22T15:39:12] Mirono escooters: This is memable
[2023-08-22T15:39:26] Mirono escooters: Wich is still big enough
[2023-08-22T15:41:25] Mirono escooters: 51822 Perfect
[2023-08-22T18:59:08] Gabe Enzo: Normies are gonna kill themselves
[2023-08-22T19:01:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: Lol
[2023-08-22T19:18:08] S1m 0n: Sharing providers have understood that it is important that the scooters are sealedüòÅ
[2023-08-22T19:23:31] Pablo Fernandez: Average user when they tell them the scooter has light rain waterproof
[2023-08-22T20:05:29] Gabe Enzo: Does anyone believe that Fido ebikes are gay as fuck? like seriously if I see a dude on a bike with that tiny motor then I assume you have a DUI
[2023-08-22T20:06:29] Gabe Enzo: Advanced water cooling
[2023-08-22T20:09:01] Gabe Enzo: 300w motor to 30000w
[2023-08-23T00:16:17] Mirono escooters: Nice coupok
[2023-08-23T00:33:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: Please tell us if they now use super Chinese mosfet or Huayi
[2023-08-23T03:42:59] Eric Howat: Have a very basic question for you all, once I throw the 75v VESC in my Zero10x 52v18ah (1200w hubs) does anyone know if it will be faster then a VSETT10+ 60v25H (1400w hubs) on stock controllers?
[2023-08-23T03:43:32] Eric Howat: Not sure if that‚Äôs too broad of a question so sorry if it is lol
[2023-08-23T04:16:10] Oreo huzky: Nami frame with kaabo fork? https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGJs4bmf1/
[2023-08-23T04:26:20] Eric Howat: I believe so I talked to him not long ago on Facebook about that build
[2023-08-23T04:27:11] Pablo Fernandez: Only way to make nami stem not break, not having it
[2023-08-23T09:26:18] rosheee: @Simone_19
[2023-08-23T09:39:52] Unknown: üòéüòá
[2023-08-23T10:35:24] Gabe Enzo: Lol according to a gastard im arguing with, apparently electric vehicles are incapable of having more than 10 horsepower.
[2023-08-23T10:36:49] Gabe Enzo: Instant torque says hello üòÇ
[2023-08-23T10:37:06] Mirono escooters: Tf
[2023-08-23T10:38:05] Gabe Enzo: So I sent him a link to a flipsky 600a 84v.
[2023-08-23T10:38:13] Gabe Enzo: lmfao
[2023-08-23T10:38:21] Gabe Enzo: That's like, 50kw.
[2023-08-23T10:38:39] Gabe Enzo: Nah man I genuinly can't wait till gas Vs E racing becomes mainstream
[2023-08-23T10:38:51] Gabe Enzo: I wanna shove it in their faces.
[2023-08-23T10:39:18] Gabe Enzo: The amount of bets that people will make will generate so much revenue it will be unbelievable cash
[2023-08-23T10:40:23] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_9386@23-08-2023_10-40-23.jpg>

[2023-08-23T10:40:43] Gabe Enzo: OOO so scared of your 2 stroke 7hp pitbike that sags when going 80kmh. shitting my pants man.
[2023-08-23T10:41:26] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_9388@23-08-2023_10-41-26.jpg>
[2023-08-23T10:48:27] Mirono escooters: Gas is still 8√ó more energy dense
[2023-08-23T10:49:10] Mirono escooters: I stopped bothering with haters. No point
[2023-08-23T10:49:34] Gabe Enzo: For races that doesn't matter at all.
[2023-08-23T10:49:45] Gabe Enzo: what matters is power output. I know what you mean tho.
[2023-08-23T10:50:03] Gabe Enzo: Compared to Lithium Ion? what about LIPO
[2023-08-23T10:50:12] Mirono escooters: Meh, you need more batteries or go recharge 50 times / Swap batt over
[2023-08-23T10:50:18] Mirono escooters: Still not
[2023-08-23T10:50:34] Mirono escooters: Li ion and lipo is very close. Lipo is just more dangerous/higher A output But ah wise . Nop
[2023-08-23T10:52:01] Gabe Enzo: what they don't tell you is that combustion motors are only 22% efficient. the rest is noise, vibration and heat.
[2023-08-23T10:52:12] Gabe Enzo: Even the best gas motors out there are 30%
[2023-08-23T10:52:18] Gabe Enzo: That makes it *almost* even.
[2023-08-23T10:52:25] Mirono escooters: Far from, but okkhey
[2023-08-23T10:52:27] Gabe Enzo: lithium being twice less energy dense at the final stage
[2023-08-23T10:52:38] Gabe Enzo: 2x is workable
[2023-08-23T10:52:56] Mirono escooters: You are missing my point, you have to take way more weight with you for same power and range Wich in a race is crucial, a pitstop takes much longer then some driver errors
[2023-08-23T10:53:00] Jan: Diesel engines up to 50% efficiency
[2023-08-23T10:53:12] Gabe Enzo: Not for racing, but true dat.
[2023-08-23T10:53:17] Mirono escooters: Considering they remove 50gram from a race car, no
[2023-08-23T10:53:30] Mirono escooters: F1 engines with methanol are even better
[2023-08-23T10:53:31] Jan: Fuel energy density >>> current battery tech
[2023-08-23T10:53:51] Jan: Like big container ships
[2023-08-23T10:53:52] Gabe Enzo: So the only game we have is immediate torque and acceleration
[2023-08-23T10:53:55] Mirono escooters: Sorry, but dinosaurus juice just makes more sense atm for those things
[2023-08-23T10:54:08] Mirono escooters: No gearbox is kinda the best thing about it
[2023-08-23T10:54:08] Jan: Most dense we use is nuclear
[2023-08-23T10:54:15] Mirono escooters: xD tru
[2023-08-23T10:54:50] Jan: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Stirling_radioisotope_generator
[2023-08-23T10:55:10] Jan: Thats about the most efficient nuclear to electric conversion
[2023-08-23T10:55:43] Mirono escooters: Now build a car around it
[2023-08-23T10:55:48] Mirono escooters: Nuclear boats/submarines make so much sense But eh, failed
[2023-08-23T10:55:55] Mirono escooters: Oh well wrong group for this
[2023-08-23T10:55:59] Jan: ^^
[2023-08-23T10:56:14] Jan: We just need nuclear vesc
[2023-08-23T10:57:03] Jan: 40kg scooter, 130W max power, infinite range for its lifetime
[2023-08-23T11:01:15] Gabe Enzo: Doable with a Lead coating.
[2023-08-23T11:05:24] Gabe Enzo: lmao forgot about that entirely.
[2023-08-23T11:05:47] Gabe Enzo: With the torque, a gearbox would let us go light speed.
[2023-08-23T11:06:17] Gabe Enzo: (if it wouldn't shred)
[2023-08-23T11:06:36] Gabe Enzo: Lol
[2023-08-23T11:06:50] Mirono escooters: ??
[2023-08-23T11:07:10] Mirono escooters: The whole idea of electric motors is you don't need a gearbox üò≠
[2023-08-23T11:07:14] Mirono escooters: Man is going backwards
[2023-08-23T11:07:35] Mirono escooters: Higher voltage and field weakening are your gearbox And phase amps
[2023-08-23T11:07:41] puneDir: wheres the right one üò≥
[2023-08-23T11:08:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: Well, it does, look at F1 vs Fe
[2023-08-23T11:08:22] Mirono escooters: Unexisting
[2023-08-23T11:08:48] puneDir: Cmon
[2023-08-23T11:10:17] Gabe Enzo: Do you know the concept of wasted torque?
[2023-08-23T11:10:30] Gabe Enzo: Like true there is field weakening
[2023-08-23T11:11:00] Gabe Enzo: but a gearbox would let the tyres spin faster than the motor is capable of revolving.
[2023-08-23T11:11:08] Gabe Enzo: Cause it would fall apart, bearings, magnets and all.
[2023-08-23T11:11:53] Jan: Pu238 is an alpha emitter. A paper is enough
[2023-08-23T11:11:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: I don't know where is going this discussion
[2023-08-23T11:12:07] Gabe Enzo: Eh just some stone talk
[2023-08-23T11:12:14] Gabe Enzo: Nothing important
[2023-08-23T11:24:46] Mirono escooters: You miss the point but ok
[2023-08-23T11:25:42] Mirono escooters: I stop with it
[2023-08-23T12:51:28] Simone: I'm here playing with the mantis and my "proto" üòÇüòÇ
[2023-08-23T13:00:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: I know the left one üòÇ I was her friend until she opened onlyfans lol
[2023-08-23T13:01:56] Jan: Everyone onlyfans these days lol
[2023-08-23T13:02:47] Mirono escooters: The question is who pays thatüòß
[2023-08-23T13:02:58] Mirono escooters: When Paolo opens OnlyFans I consider

[2023-08-23T18:10:30] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 2pcs v4 will also come to us soonüëç
[2023-08-23T18:23:57] Face de Pin Suc√©: Already ?
[2023-08-23T18:33:55] JPPL: The Beasts are spreading
[2023-08-23T18:59:11] Jakub Szczypi√≥r: Yep, where can I find piout of those two connectors? Manual refers to older version with just one connector
[2023-08-23T19:03:12] Unknown: Wow
[2023-08-23T19:33:15] Gabe Enzo: Woah, what XT connector is that
[2023-08-23T19:33:50] Gabe Enzo: Erm
[2023-08-23T19:34:05] Gabe Enzo: not normal
[2023-08-23T19:35:49] Jakub Szczypi√≥r: 8mm bullet connector
[2023-08-23T19:38:03] Gabe Enzo: Its literally not sealed
[2023-08-23T19:38:23] Gabe Enzo: it can short
[2023-08-23T19:40:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: When you connect bullet you cover it with another heat shrink
[2023-08-23T19:40:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: So it‚Äôs all good
[2023-08-23T19:41:19] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Before you connecting it you protect it with another on top
[2023-08-23T19:41:51] Gabe Enzo: Oh hey, hahaha you're the one that got me into ev modding
[2023-08-23T19:41:55] Gabe Enzo: you made that 75kmh Xiaomi
[2023-08-23T19:42:02] Gabe Enzo: I saw you on YouTube
[2023-08-23T19:42:09] Gabe Enzo: Then I made my own that goes as fast as yours
[2023-08-23T19:42:11] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Oh, nice
[2023-08-23T19:42:13] Gabe Enzo: üòπ
[2023-08-23T19:42:34] Gabe Enzo: anyways, thank you for getting me into the hobby
[2023-08-23T19:52:51] Jakub Szczypi√≥r: ok, now I see that updated manual is on ragemechanics site but not on 3shul üòÇ
[2023-08-23T19:58:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: You can find on our product page on Rage Mechanics website
[2023-08-23T19:58:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: That's okay, you put shrink on it when you connect :)
[2023-08-23T19:58:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: Haha you found out perfect
[2023-08-23T20:16:00] Mirono escooters: It is. You do another shrinkwrap over it
[2023-08-23T20:59:18] Happy Giraffe: Could have a torque converter like in a Koenigsegg carüåö
[2023-08-23T21:01:11] Happy Giraffe: Someone make OnlyFans with vesc content and name account: OnlyVesc
[2023-08-23T21:34:48] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2023-08-23T21:53:45] Gabe Enzo: isn't a gearbox literally another name for a torque converter
[2023-08-23T21:53:55] Gabe Enzo: lmfao
[2023-08-23T22:03:26] Happy Giraffe: No, torque converter like Koenigsegg gives one gear that lets motor run on high rpm max horsepower mode all the time
[2023-08-24T00:05:56] Mirono escooters: I'm confusement
[2023-08-24T00:05:59] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_9391@24-08-2023_00-05-59.jpg>
[2023-08-24T00:06:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: This is like markervasd
[2023-08-24T00:25:14] Mirono escooters: I don't know
[2023-08-24T00:25:15] Mirono escooters: It seems ok
[2023-08-24T00:25:35] Mirono escooters: What is the best bullet size for all around use? 120a maximum, short period of time
[2023-08-24T00:25:38] Mirono escooters: 4mm? 5?
[2023-08-24T00:26:34] Mirono escooters: Phase
[2023-08-24T00:28:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: You touch the bullet when you ride?
[2023-08-24T00:58:34] Eric Howat: Bullets are a huge hold back, direct solder everything (except battery leads use a spark resistant xt90) and use good quality oxygen free copper / silicone wiring and never worry again üòâ
[2023-08-24T01:06:51] Eric Howat: Imo I just prefer soldering. If you use a high quality bullet of a larger diameter they should be fine but I prefer no risk of resistance or loss of connection as I‚Äôve seen bullets fail and I‚Äôve seen them bottle neck resistance at the solder point
[2023-08-24T01:07:58] Eric Howat: If you can solder, you can resolder üòÅ so bullets are just a convenience factor and most people will never unplug them unless they are making a large change
[2023-08-24T01:08:53] Eric Howat: I just like soldering things. I‚Äôve dealt with too many automotive issues related to cheap connectors let‚Äôs just say that
[2023-08-24T01:10:07] Eric Howat: I almost ran into that yesterday changing tires on a VSETT10+. Can‚Äôt believe they ran the hubs with the ring-ring side on the phase wires. Had to force the damn tire over the hub idiotic to me they didn‚Äôt manufacture like my varla with the split ring on the opposite side of the phase wires

[2023-08-24T01:11:29] Eric Howat: I mean come on üòÇ
[2023-08-24T01:12:27] Eric Howat: Love the vsett10+ the electronics are tucked away nicely and manufacturing is much better the any of the other brands but that‚Äôs just a stupid design they used lol
[2023-08-24T01:13:08] Eric Howat: I could go on about how it‚Äôs sick and I like it and what I absolutely hate about it but I‚Äôd bore y‚Äôall to death lol
[2023-08-24T01:14:50] Eric Howat: Haha you probably do! I decided to go VESC on the varla because I like the platform much more for jumping and size but it needs some VSETT hubs and battery, soon to come lol
[2023-08-24T01:15:24] Eric Howat: Well a custom battery that is, deff won‚Äôt fit üòÇ
[2023-08-24T01:16:10] Eric Howat: Also, quick question. What do you think about these throttles? Shanrya Thumb Throttle, Useful E Bike Speed Controller Good Operating Feel TPR Material Buttons 270X Thumb Throttle Accelerator with Waterproof Connector for Riding, Electronic Bicycle https://a.co/d/iXtwNaM
[2023-08-24T01:17:04] Eric Howat: That‚Äôs the plan already have a buddy who will print me one !
[2023-08-24T01:17:20] Eric Howat: Sweet I plan to use two one for regen one for throttle.
[2023-08-24T01:17:50] Gabe Enzo: why would something add resistance if it's not stopping flow. wouldn't the electricity just take the shortest route and ignore the extra metal?
[2023-08-24T01:18:23] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Omg, best throttle ever. for bicycle handlebarüòç
[2023-08-24T01:18:32] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: I'm using same on xiaomi
[2023-08-24T01:19:22] Eric Howat: Awesome thanks for the input I‚Äôm geeked. VESC shipped today can‚Äôt wait to get it all setup. Wondering if I should limit the output to the 60a the BMS is limited too or bypass the BMS. Not sure if anyone has input on that
[2023-08-24T01:19:49] Gabe Enzo: Also, on the phase wire topic, if i were to charge half of the phase wire length to silicone 14 Awg instead of 18awg, is that an issue?
[2023-08-24T01:19:50] Eric Howat: Would keep the input limited by the BMS obviously
[2023-08-24T01:20:24] Eric Howat: I don‚Äôt see why not. Length isn‚Äôt going to increase by much so I don‚Äôt see any issue especially when going to a thicker wire
[2023-08-24T01:20:49] Gabe Enzo: Cool, My original Xiaomi phase wires are literally crumbling apart. They will short soon.
[2023-08-24T01:21:04] Gabe Enzo: I CANT believe that shit went through testing
[2023-08-24T01:21:29] Gabe Enzo: And also shortening the length would improve efficiency by like 3% ya
[2023-08-24T01:22:05] Eric Howat: Mine are like that too in my varla, they used fucking aluminum wires üòÇ
[2023-08-24T01:22:16] Gabe Enzo: Yeah same, they don't bend
[2023-08-24T01:22:19] Gabe Enzo: Crazy
[2023-08-24T01:22:31] Eric Howat: All the insulation is cracked af and was when I opened it up at 50 miles
[2023-08-24T01:22:49] Gabe Enzo: I have an issue with hiding the hall sensor wires
[2023-08-24T01:23:04] Gabe Enzo: I have to change those too. they're aluminium
[2023-08-24T01:23:16] Gabe Enzo: Doesn't look clean at all
[2023-08-24T01:24:14] Eric Howat: What scooter?
[2023-08-24T01:24:21] Gabe Enzo: Xiaomi Pro 2. 20s.
[2023-08-24T01:25:34] Gabe Enzo: The hall sensor wires are sticking out and it looks disgusting. As a consequence of me installing 4mm gold plugs.
[2023-08-24T01:26:03] Gabe Enzo: if the ESC fries, there's no way to walk a bricked motor home.
[2023-08-24T01:26:12] Gabe Enzo: So the outside plugs solve that
[2023-08-24T01:26:26] Gabe Enzo: constant E brake basically
[2023-08-24T01:26:53] Gabe Enzo: My bud wants to get a varla eagle pro
[2023-08-24T01:27:03] Eric Howat: I think I‚Äôm going to stay around 60-70 just to be on the safe side until I build a better pack
[2023-08-24T01:27:26] Eric Howat: True, but my varla I‚Äôm not taking the deck off to unplug Shit to walk home I‚Äôll call Uber üòÇ
[2023-08-24T01:28:06] Eric Howat: That‚Äôs what I figured I was assuming it‚Äôll take 100a easily, it‚Äôs the battery and BMS holding it back
[2023-08-24T01:28:21] Gabe Enzo: Banana plugs are very nice for outside rivet connectors
[2023-08-24T01:28:37] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_9394@24-08-2023_01-28-37.jpg>
[2023-08-24T01:28:53] Gabe Enzo: those hall wires are my issue rn
[2023-08-24T01:28:57] Gabe Enzo: gotta fix tomorrow
[2023-08-24T01:29:03] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: haha
[2023-08-24T01:29:46] Eric Howat: Not a bad idea, I just can‚Äôt justify that because I ride mine REALLY hard lol
[2023-08-24T04:04:08] JPPL: üòÇüòÇ
[2023-08-24T06:05:00] Happy Giraffe: Hahahahhahahahahahahahaha
[2023-08-24T08:12:58] Gabe Enzo: > 1500w I'll stick to my 3000w Xiaomi
[2023-08-24T08:13:17] Gabe Enzo: Consumer shit is so underpowered üòπ
[2023-08-24T08:17:49] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: true
[2023-08-24T08:35:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: on scooter meet there was one stock King GT Wolf, everyone whOA, i tried it, be like bro that is slower than my single motorüíÄ
[2023-08-24T08:58:08] Eric Howat: I know I‚Äôm beating a dead horse asking this again, but with a 52v18.2ah sincpower battery (14x18650 cells) what amperage can I safely pull off it? I‚Äôm figuring 60is the max the BMS will allow but if bypassed does anyone know what I could pull?
[2023-08-24T08:59:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I cannot tell without knowing anything about the cells, but DO NOT BYPASS BMS.
[2023-08-24T08:59:44] Happy Giraffe: Yeah 52v is 14s but need to know cell type and parallel amount
[2023-08-24T09:00:16] Happy Giraffe: If we assume chinese cells with let's say 8p then it's like 40A
[2023-08-24T09:00:21] Mirono escooters: I wouldn't even try above 40
[2023-08-24T09:00:41] Eric Howat: Generic 18650 cells I‚Äôm bench speaking as I haven‚Äôt tore it apart yet
[2023-08-24T09:00:56] Happy Giraffe: I would stay 40 and under
[2023-08-24T09:01:06] Happy Giraffe: China cell you want to avoid at all cost
[2023-08-24T09:01:34] Eric Howat: It‚Äôs in a varla eagle one
[2023-08-24T09:01:34] Eric Howat: Yeah I‚Äôll be building a new pack soon just still mapping out what will fit and what won‚Äôt lol
[2023-08-24T09:02:18] Eric Howat: From the factory it has 2x 30a controllers so I figured it has have a max of 60a on the BMS?
[2023-08-24T09:03:18] Eric Howat: Misspoke it‚Äôs 25a controllers lol
[2023-08-24T09:06:38] Mirono escooters: Yah and peak
[2023-08-24T09:07:06] Eric Howat: Gotcha so safe point is probably like 45a on the VESC then
[2023-08-24T09:07:13] Happy Giraffe: If building pack diy you must have proper skills for that. Reading online not good enough if you don't have an experienced friend to help ya out
[2023-08-24T09:07:46] Eric Howat: Oh yes I have a couple friends who know their shit so I won‚Äôt be tackling that job alone lol
[2023-08-24T09:09:59] Gabe Enzo: i bypassed my Xiaomi BMS's
[2023-08-24T09:10:53] Gabe Enzo: shorted shunts
[2023-08-24T09:11:32] Gabe Enzo: lucky to have friends like that ngl
[2023-08-24T09:11:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: That is shunting, not bypassing.
[2023-08-24T09:11:55] Gabe Enzo: everyone i know irl is brain-dead normie
[2023-08-24T09:11:58] Eric Howat: Yeah bro it‚Äôs super nice.
[2023-08-24T09:12:04] Gabe Enzo: What does bypass mean
[2023-08-24T09:12:14] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: bypass = basically no bms for discharge
[2023-08-24T09:12:27] Eric Howat: How much more amps did you pull lol
[2023-08-24T09:12:39] Gabe Enzo: 40a X2 series
[2023-08-24T09:12:42] Gabe Enzo: 43 A
[2023-08-24T09:13:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: people do shit like that and then be liKE hUh mY vEsC tUrneD inTo cOal
[2023-08-24T09:13:07] Eric Howat: I was thinking about doing that but sounds sketchy lol
[2023-08-24T09:13:27] Gabe Enzo: Batt got so hot that it disabled the other one next to it.
[2023-08-24T09:13:30] Gabe Enzo: üóø
[2023-08-24T09:13:32] Eric Howat: Why would it hurt the VESC? I‚Äôd be worried about hurting the battery lol
[2023-08-24T09:13:56] Gabe Enzo: U mean batt?
[2023-08-24T09:14:12] Gabe Enzo: why would esc care
[2023-08-24T09:14:23] Mirono escooters: Skill issue
[2023-08-24T09:14:30] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Most of the time people that do these kind of things are very new to VESC and are VERY likely to kill theirs. As soon your MOSFETs are dead, it will short and your PCB will act as fuse.
[2023-08-24T09:14:56] Mirono escooters: Atleast use a fuse üò≥
[2023-08-24T09:15:14] Eric Howat: Oh yes agreed. I wouldn‚Äôt plan to send a crazy amount more amperage then the BMS allowed, but just a little tiny bit lol
[2023-08-24T09:15:36] Eric Howat: I‚Äôm going to rewrite the battery anyways, uses shit aluminum wire I believe to begin with if I recall
[2023-08-24T09:17:33] Mirono escooters: XD what??
[2023-08-24T09:17:41] Mirono escooters: No way. Problably tinned copper wire
[2023-08-24T09:17:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yup
[2023-08-24T09:17:56] Mirono escooters: Just wait for a proper batt
[2023-08-24T09:18:03] puneDir: i want to make 75100 cutoff proof
[2023-08-24T09:18:13] Mirono escooters: How
[2023-08-24T09:18:14] puneDir: is there a tutorial for that?
[2023-08-24T09:18:23] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2023-08-24T09:18:33] Mirono escooters: It's a hardwarr issue, shit mos drivers. So
[2023-08-24T09:18:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: buy as many 75100 as you can
[2023-08-24T09:18:46] puneDir: Idk but since theyre in resin now it would be hard to repair
[2023-08-24T09:19:35] Eric Howat: Yeah I‚Äôll probably play it safe. Don‚Äôt need a damaged cell down the road catching on fire in my house XD
[2023-08-24T09:19:39] puneDir: and im using daly bms üòÉ so i guess it would br problematic
[2023-08-24T09:23:16] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2023-08-24T09:23:27] Mirono escooters: Just config vesc well w cutoff
[2023-08-24T09:24:57] Eric Howat: That‚Äôs what I was imagining. I‚Äôll probably run the VESC to test the BMS cut off and check battery temps then possibly bypass and bump up very little, check temps again and go from there if I ever even bypass
[2023-08-24T09:25:15] Eric Howat: Running out of time this year only a month or two left before it gets cold here in MI
[2023-08-24T09:25:56] Gabe Enzo: Yeah it's gotten cold where I am too. Batteries starting to sag.
[2023-08-24T09:26:06] Gabe Enzo: The niceness of Summer is over
[2023-08-24T09:26:18] Eric Howat: I‚Äôve ridden my varla in dead of winter in 8‚Äù of snow just to do it haha
[2023-08-24T09:26:30] Eric Howat: Worked great suprisingly
[2023-08-24T09:27:02] Gabe Enzo: The more amps you draw, the less chance of voltage sag üòú
[2023-08-24T09:27:18] Gabe Enzo: Heat that fucker
[2023-08-24T09:27:58] Eric Howat: Good point lol
[2023-08-24T09:28:13] puneDir: U have 2 pro2 batteries in series?
[2023-08-24T09:28:17] Gabe Enzo: Yes
[2023-08-24T09:28:30] puneDir: I had the same
[2023-08-24T09:29:00] Gabe Enzo: I don't need more than 3000w with the motor I have currently. so The "low power battery" is fine for me
[2023-08-24T09:29:01] puneDir: <photos/photo_9395@24-08-2023_09-29-01.jpg>
[2023-08-24T09:29:03] Mirono escooters: Do not even consider bypass üò≠
[2023-08-24T09:29:30] Mirono escooters: Had xd
[2023-08-24T09:29:37] Gabe Enzo: is that black silicones
[2023-08-24T09:29:49] puneDir: I was pulling 30a from them and they was getting hot asf
[2023-08-24T09:29:57] Eric Howat: Why not? Maybe I want to ride a 40mph fireball lmao jk
[2023-08-24T09:30:00] Gabe Enzo: 30 is what I draw normally
[2023-08-24T09:30:02] puneDir: How do you pull 42a
[2023-08-24T09:30:06] Gabe Enzo: what? 30 is stock
[2023-08-24T09:30:14] puneDir: 20s 30a
[2023-08-24T09:30:17] puneDir: 15-15 each
[2023-08-24T09:30:17] Gabe Enzo: if they get too hot, it shuts off
[2023-08-24T09:30:22] Gabe Enzo: bruh no
[2023-08-24T09:30:25] Gabe Enzo: that's not how series works
[2023-08-24T09:30:29] puneDir: I mean
[2023-08-24T09:30:31] Gabe Enzo: Not parallel
[2023-08-24T09:30:33] puneDir: 15-15 on motors
[2023-08-24T09:30:36] puneDir: Total 30
[2023-08-24T09:31:06] Gabe Enzo: I drew 20a from one and 43a from the other. One battery I forgot to shunt. And I forced 33A esc draw.
[2023-08-24T09:31:35] puneDir: u use vesc?
[2023-08-24T09:31:41] Gabe Enzo: No, XeSc
[2023-08-24T09:32:03] puneDir: How do you fit two
[2023-08-24T09:32:05] Gabe Enzo: Irrelevant to the convo
[2023-08-24T09:32:20] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_9396@24-08-2023_09-32-20.jpg>
[2023-08-24T09:32:33] Gabe Enzo: Single motor
[2023-08-24T09:32:36] puneDir: Nice
[2023-08-24T09:32:57] Gabe Enzo: I can go 70 with 8.5inch and 7A FW. I'm planning to go 85 with 10" and 12A FW
[2023-08-24T09:33:22] Gabe Enzo: at the least
[2023-08-24T09:34:08] Gabe Enzo: 90 would be nice with stock motor LOL
[2023-08-24T09:34:38] Gabe Enzo: im light as fuck
[2023-08-24T10:24:05] Happy Giraffe: Does anybody know what happens exactly when batt cutoffs or disconnects during riding?ü§î
[2023-08-24T10:26:06] Mirono escooters: Good vesc lives Bad dies
[2023-08-24T11:26:50] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-08-24T11:27:22] Happy Giraffe: Propably my home insurance will cover burned vesc if I say I fell with bikeüòÇ
[2023-08-24T14:15:44] Eric Howat: I‚Äôd be careful with that, I‚Äôm an insurance agent and if you have my company (AAA) they won‚Äôt cover PEVs or damage caused by PEVs in 9/10 situations
[2023-08-24T14:18:07] Happy Giraffe: They cover all "accidents" to my propertyüòÅ ofc not gonna abuse it but still nice to have it
[2023-08-24T14:20:14] Eric Howat: That‚Äôs good, but so do we and it‚Äôs a huge topic of what to do about PEVs because companies know the liability of a li-po fire are high so they don‚Äôt want to cover it lol it‚Äôs still a gray area for most companies
[2023-08-24T16:34:02] Gabe Enzo: lithium ion* if that were true then electric cars wouldn't be insured. Its an excuse
[2023-08-24T16:39:29] Gabe Enzo: PGVs are illegal btw.
[2023-08-24T16:39:33] Gabe Enzo: lol
[2023-08-24T16:39:44] Gabe Enzo: gas scooters and gokarts can't get insured
[2023-08-24T19:42:29] Eric Howat: I‚Äôll tell you right now, if your insurance company pays out on a fire claim due to a PEV they are dropping you faster then you‚Äôll know. My company legit states that they do not cover any pev vehicles or any damage incurred, however I do believe they would pay out and cancel you and then trying to find another carrier is going to be a challenge. I only charge outside away from the house for this specific reason
[2023-08-24T19:57:00] Pablo Fernandez: I dont know where you live but here every company covers any fire doesnt matter the cause
[2023-08-24T19:57:52] Pablo Fernandez: I charge It on another house i got in front of mine because i live on a House but insurance is no issue here
[2023-08-24T20:14:25] Eric Howat: I‚Äôm in MI but it does depend on company and state don‚Äôt get me wrong, however based upon the amount of PEV fires increases insurance companies don‚Äôt want that liability because they are realistically dangerous items to store in a house.

[2023-08-25T08:45:45] Simone: <animation>
[2023-08-25T11:27:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Stock phase cable?
[2023-08-25T11:27:50] Face de Pin Suc√©: Of course, it's a Rion üòÇ
[2023-08-25T11:27:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: 4mm¬≤
[2023-08-25T11:28:12] Face de Pin Suc√©: Will melt so fast
[2023-08-25T11:29:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: I mean, he didn‚Äôt changed it
[2023-08-25T11:29:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: Very risky
[2023-08-25T11:29:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yeaj
[2023-08-25T11:29:38] Face de Pin Suc√©: Because it's Rion

[2023-08-25T11:54:48] Happy Giraffe: Spintend 100v alu single
[2023-08-25T11:54:48] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_9402@25-08-2023_11-54-48.jpg>
[2023-08-25T11:55:25] Happy Giraffe: Not properly soldered...would you guys resolder it better? Its just touching the surface of the solder blob
[2023-08-25T11:57:20] Happy Giraffe: My 800-1200w rated 20mm stator geared hub has same phase thicknessüòÖüåö
[2023-08-25T12:07:27] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Even segway gt series has higher phase cable thickness
[2023-08-25T12:08:19] Mirono escooters: :(
[2023-08-25T12:08:43] Mirono escooters: I no like that quality control lol
[2023-08-25T12:08:48] Mirono escooters: No SPintend fan
[2023-08-25T12:09:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: Xd, ha has the oldest rion
[2023-08-25T12:09:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: How battery and motors will hold
[2023-08-25T12:13:18] Gabe Enzo: That's fine
[2023-08-25T12:13:27] Gabe Enzo: It looks disgusting but it's fine
[2023-08-25T12:15:42] Mirono escooters: It's not
[2023-08-25T12:15:51] Mirono escooters: That'll break off after vibrations
[2023-08-25T12:16:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: Not fine at all
[2023-08-25T12:18:26] Simone: Yes üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-08-25T12:30:54] Happy Giraffe: Still solder balls inside, I go 3Shul 100% not tolerating Spintend QC. They might even pull the stunt that they refuse warranty if opened some day
[2023-08-25T12:46:23] Mirono escooters: XD still solder balls
[2023-08-25T12:46:24] Mirono escooters: Noobs
[2023-08-25T12:46:34] Mirono escooters: I never liked SPintend
[2023-08-25T12:55:30] Happy Giraffe: It would literally take them 10 seconds to look with a big microscope....
[2023-08-25T13:05:59] Yosi Moreno: For sure
[2023-08-25T17:18:27] Eric Howat: Hey hey I have a buddy who wants to go VESC on his varla pro, but he wants to know what kind of displays are out there he can use. Any recommendations would be apprecaited
[2023-08-25T17:20:25] Mirono escooters: Not too many
[2023-08-25T17:20:28] Mirono escooters: Davega
[2023-08-25T17:27:10] Mirono escooters: @AJAJ1992 let's see how good itis for a scooter part
[2023-08-25T17:27:15] Mirono escooters: Eats nozzles for breakfast
[2023-08-25T17:27:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Worst brand ever
[2023-08-25T17:27:43] Finn: Hardend steel nozzle
[2023-08-25T17:27:48] Mirono escooters: Nothing wrong with it
[2023-08-25T17:27:50] Finn: Better for printing with carbon
[2023-08-25T17:27:53] Mirono escooters: Problably over 80kg now
[2023-08-25T17:27:58] Mirono escooters: Yah I have hardened steel
[2023-08-25T17:28:00] Mirono escooters: Still will fuck it
[2023-08-25T17:28:06] Mirono escooters: +15* with hardened nozzle right?
[2023-08-25T17:28:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: Pla and standard petg both sucks
[2023-08-25T17:28:10] Mirono escooters: It was smth like dat
[2023-08-25T17:28:10] Finn: Use bambu lab quality
[2023-08-25T17:28:14] Mirono escooters: Ok you do you
[2023-08-25T17:28:23] Finn: Fr
[2023-08-25T17:28:28] Mirono escooters: My 80kg tells otherwise
[2023-08-25T17:28:28] Finn: I use pla daily
[2023-08-25T17:28:58] Jan: Not a fan of short carbon fiber filaments. The stiffness goes up a bit but its not really a stronger part.
[2023-08-25T17:29:03] Finn: Got old intel nuc for free with i3
[2023-08-25T17:29:04] Mirono escooters: Oh well
[2023-08-25T17:29:06] Mirono escooters: Worth a shot
[2023-08-25T17:29:08] Finn: New flasg station for scooter
[2023-08-25T17:29:13] Mirono escooters: It's structural extension for my stand
[2023-08-25T17:29:21] Mirono escooters: XD I got this for free today:
[2023-08-25T17:29:28] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_9406@25-08-2023_17-29-28.jpg>
[2023-08-25T17:29:54] Finn: Scaling looks weiered on old dell bios
[2023-08-25T17:29:59] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-08-25T17:30:01] Mirono escooters: It is on a tv
[2023-08-25T17:30:02] Jan: Also hardened steel nozzles are crap
[2023-08-25T17:30:05] Mirono escooters: Oh
[2023-08-25T17:30:09] Finn: Lmao
[2023-08-25T17:30:10] Mirono escooters: I'll use brass then?
[2023-08-25T17:30:17] Mirono escooters: 12h print At the end it'll be a 0.8mm nozzl
[2023-08-25T17:30:28] Mirono escooters: Minecraft server, very good pc for it
[2023-08-25T17:30:32] Mirono escooters: Gpu sucks but who needs that
[2023-08-25T17:30:39] Finn: Nah too inefficient
[2023-08-25T17:30:40] Jan: 15W/mK trade off for a harder nozzle is a fucking lol
[2023-08-25T17:30:43] Jan: Full tungsten carbide
[2023-08-25T17:30:47] Jan: Not coated
[2023-08-25T17:30:48] Mirono escooters: It's just a few hours a week, it'll be fine
[2023-08-25T17:30:50] Finn: Zen 3 better
[2023-08-25T17:30:55] Mirono escooters: I don't shit moneyü•≤
[2023-08-25T17:31:01] Finn: Got i7 3gen as mc serverüòÇüòÇ
[2023-08-25T17:31:07] Finn: Inefficent too
[2023-08-25T17:31:10] Finn: But works very good
[2023-08-25T17:31:12] Mirono escooters: Free is free
[2023-08-25T17:31:15] Finn: Yeah fr
[2023-08-25T17:31:23] Jan: Then also no need for CF filaments, they are expensive for basically no benefits
[2023-08-25T17:31:41] Finn: Benefits are more strenth and more heat resistance
[2023-08-25T17:31:58] Finn: Thats why carbon fiber
[2023-08-25T17:32:02] Mirono escooters: Yah 1 roll for test üò≠
[2023-08-25T17:36:45] Jan: Continuous carbon fiber 3D printing
[2023-08-25T17:37:07] Jan: Yeah no not really in that case
[2023-08-25T17:37:11] Mirono escooters: It looks weird
[2023-08-25T17:37:21] Jan: The filament contains max length 0.1mm fibers
[2023-08-25T17:37:27] Mirono escooters: They can only add so much in petg
[2023-08-25T17:37:27] Jan: Which is not that useful
[2023-08-25T17:37:30] Mirono escooters: :(
[2023-08-25T17:37:32] Mirono escooters: Yah
[2023-08-25T17:37:40] Jan: And its 5-10% max fiber
[2023-08-25T17:38:14] Jan: You would need continuous carbon fiber 60% with pekk
[2023-08-25T17:38:38] Jan: Not worth it financially, rather improve design
[2023-08-25T17:38:52] Rogerio Figueiredo: Hello guys what to you think about mantis 10 frame for vesc 75100 and vsett 10 motor?
[2023-08-25T17:39:15] Jan: Mantis king gt or original?
[2023-08-25T17:39:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: Mantis 10 original
[2023-08-25T17:39:46] Jan: Its a death trap
[2023-08-25T17:40:14] Jan: Its feasable but the neck issues are still there
[2023-08-25T17:41:27] Rogerio Figueiredo: <photos/photo_9408@25-08-2023_17-41-27.jpg>
[2023-08-25T17:41:28] Rogerio Figueiredo: Hum ok
[2023-08-25T17:41:34] Rogerio Figueiredo: S√≥ I'm running from it
[2023-08-25T17:42:31] Mirono escooters: Changes of clogging? I mean 0.4mm has always risk, but with the carbon?
[2023-08-25T17:43:02] Mirono escooters: A yes with AK thing
[2023-08-25T17:43:31] puneDir: its so shit
[2023-08-25T17:43:36] Jan: Then Kaboo never learns lol
[2023-08-25T17:43:46] puneDir: carbon fiber filament makes my hand itch for some reason
[2023-08-25T17:44:35] puneDir: Any pics of that?
[2023-08-25T17:44:38] puneDir: The snapped one
[2023-08-25T18:04:25] Happy Giraffe: Theres two types of carbon filaments in market. The shit that has cf powder and the real stuff that has cut strands. First is usually same strenght as pla/petg and real one almost like aluüòÖ This is why I havent bought CF added filaments a I havent found a good budget solution with chopped fibers
[2023-08-25T18:05:57] Mirono escooters: Fak
[2023-08-25T18:06:06] Mirono escooters: Oh well iv got the roll
[2023-08-25T18:06:51] Happy Giraffe: Rear engineering grade CF materials 100‚Ç¨/kgüòÖ
[2023-08-25T18:08:43] Mirono escooters: That's like 10h pay
[2023-08-25T18:08:55] Mirono escooters: To waste with a clogged printer ü•∞
[2023-08-25T18:10:21] Happy Giraffe: I never had mine clogged in any materialüò≥ but yeah havent tried CF yet. Plan was to buy CF 15-20% PETG but couldnt tell if it was legit or not
[2023-08-25T18:20:45] Jan: Kimya PEKK 10% CF 1000‚Ç¨/kg
[2023-08-25T18:25:33] Mirono escooters: Wtf
[2023-08-25T18:26:23] Gabe Enzo: why not just use PLA
[2023-08-25T18:26:31] puneDir: Kimya means chemistry in turkish
[2023-08-25T18:29:34] Mirono escooters: Bruh what??
[2023-08-25T18:29:44] Gabe Enzo: Wym
[2023-08-25T18:29:46] Mirono escooters: Sometimes you say such weird shit üòÇ
[2023-08-25T18:29:56] Gabe Enzo: are you talking about 3d printers
[2023-08-25T18:30:00] Mirono escooters: Each material has its properties
[2023-08-25T18:30:11] Mirono escooters: Yes, and petg makes much sense in much applications
[2023-08-25T18:30:17] Gabe Enzo: Are you saying I shouldn't use PLA for deck extenders?
[2023-08-25T18:30:25] Jan: PLA is sufficient in nearly all cases
[2023-08-25T18:30:28] Mirono escooters: Since thats directly exposed to uv all the time, no
[2023-08-25T18:30:40] Gabe Enzo: Its the only one that can print at 150 speed
[2023-08-25T18:30:41] Mirono escooters: Especially if batt rests on it
[2023-08-25T18:30:49] Mirono escooters: Me with 30mm/s üòé
[2023-08-25T18:30:58] Gabe Enzo: How does it feel to wait 3 weeks for a print
[2023-08-25T18:31:04] Mirono escooters: Good
[2023-08-25T18:31:11] Gabe Enzo: and warping isn't an issue?
[2023-08-25T18:31:15] Mirono escooters: Nop
[2023-08-25T18:31:26] Mirono escooters: Finetune and maintenance üòé
[2023-08-25T18:31:26] Gabe Enzo: I know
[2023-08-25T18:31:34] Jan: There are a lot other materials
[2023-08-25T18:31:52] Gabe Enzo: I put duct tape over mine
[2023-08-25T18:31:58] Mirono escooters: xD we always go off topic so badly (but I did start it. Although it's a scoot part)
[2023-08-25T18:32:03] Mirono escooters: I ordered 6 vescs with the sale üòé
[2023-08-25T18:32:25] Gabe Enzo: We go off topic when I enter chat
[2023-08-25T18:33:08] Gabe Enzo: Spiderman scooter
[2023-08-25T18:37:31] Pablo Fernandez: gt2 arrived today lets see if i modify something since with spanish laws i have to keep the og display my chances of modifying are low af
[2023-08-25T18:38:38] Mirono escooters: Gt2 :)
[2023-08-25T18:39:41] Pablo Fernandez: got it for 1500 so i couldnt refuse it
[2023-08-25T18:40:13] puneDir: can you remove the speed limit?
[2023-08-25T18:40:35] Mirono escooters: Steal
[2023-08-25T18:40:54] puneDir: i want a hyperscooter so badly
[2023-08-25T18:41:00] puneDir: something makes 70-80 on stock
[2023-08-25T18:41:03] Pablo Fernandez: yeah even european version can be
[2023-08-25T18:41:08] puneDir: How?
[2023-08-25T18:41:18] puneDir: What it makes without limiter
[2023-08-25T18:42:06] Gabe Enzo: What classifies as one?
[2023-08-25T18:42:39] Gabe Enzo: scooters that break 80kmh? 100?
[2023-08-25T18:43:07] Jan: scooters that break budgets
[2023-08-25T18:43:14] Pablo Fernandez: just 70 kinda meh
[2023-08-25T18:43:15] Gabe Enzo: Not a real definition
[2023-08-25T18:43:38] Gabe Enzo: well my Xiaomi definitely isn't a hyperscooter just cause it broke my wallet
[2023-08-25T18:43:42] Mirono escooters: On a scooter for me too much
[2023-08-25T18:43:46] Mirono escooters: And not much good brands out there
[2023-08-25T18:44:27] puneDir: How u remove limiter?
[2023-08-25T18:44:40] Pablo Fernandez: bought straight without it
[2023-08-25T18:44:48] Pablo Fernandez: but i know is easy to remove 100%
[2023-08-25T18:44:56] Gabe Enzo: vesc üóø
[2023-08-25T18:45:07] puneDir: there was some guy called yusuf that wants to learn
[2023-08-25T18:45:14] puneDir: but he deleted the account lol
[2023-08-25T18:45:31] Gabe Enzo: 70 is so good
[2023-08-25T18:46:06] puneDir: going 60 is easy but 70 is hard
[2023-08-25T18:46:13] Gabe Enzo: LOL IKR
[2023-08-25T18:46:16] puneDir: air resistance :D
[2023-08-25T18:46:17] Gabe Enzo: its like a light speed barrier
[2023-08-25T18:46:21] puneDir: Yes
[2023-08-25T18:46:32] Pablo Fernandez: i mean yeah but not for the price, might just upgrade the battery to 40ah and let it be
[2023-08-25T18:46:43] puneDir: vesc it and 20s
[2023-08-25T18:46:48] Mirono escooters: It's stock already good
[2023-08-25T18:46:49] puneDir: that motors are amazing as i heard
[2023-08-25T18:47:10] Mirono escooters: Good enough
[2023-08-25T18:47:41] Pablo Fernandez: i have to keep stock display
[2023-08-25T18:47:49] puneDir: i want better motors on my g30 but in other hand i dont wanna mod it more because its gonna snap soon
[2023-08-25T18:47:50] Pablo Fernandez: police control daily
[2023-08-25T18:48:06] puneDir: isnt it possible to write lisp code or smth?
[2023-08-25T18:48:07] Gabe Enzo: Get a Xiaomi frame and connect VESC to Dashboard. Problem solves
[2023-08-25T18:48:17] Gabe Enzo: Easy
[2023-08-25T18:48:26] Gabe Enzo: üòÇ
[2023-08-25T18:48:35] Gabe Enzo: That's such a weird law
[2023-08-25T18:48:41] Gabe Enzo: As if the display changes the fact
[2023-08-25T18:49:49] Gabe Enzo: isn't the law in Spain that as long as the motor is 500w nominal you can do what you want?
[2023-08-25T18:51:06] Pablo Fernandez: until 2027 there are some laws (25kmh) no w limit. from 2027 and ahead only legal escooters are the ones aproved on a list by the government
[2023-08-25T18:52:30] Gabe Enzo: "approved'' oh dear. they're probably gonna be the ones with secret government-company collabs and be very expensive and poorly made
[2023-08-25T18:52:58] Pablo Fernandez: the list is released, i will send you the "highest performance" one
[2023-08-25T18:53:09] Gabe Enzo: LOL, do show
[2023-08-25T18:53:49] Gabe Enzo: Here Escooters are plain illegal, they just get towed depending on the police around. Only way around it is to make a scooter so quick you can outrun the police.
[2023-08-25T18:54:27] Gabe Enzo: well, not like fast, but able to dissapear quickly.
[2023-08-25T18:54:29] Pablo Fernandez: highest performance legal escooter
[2023-08-25T18:54:39] Gabe Enzo: LOL
[2023-08-25T18:54:43] Gabe Enzo: 1300w
[2023-08-25T18:54:46] Gabe Enzo: That's hilarious
[2023-08-25T18:54:59] Pablo Fernandez: and being a smartgyro you will mostly die before you get to 50kmh, worst quality in the market
[2023-08-25T18:55:35] Gabe Enzo: That's like a stock pro 2 with firmware
[2023-08-25T18:56:01] Gabe Enzo: and FW
[2023-08-25T18:56:01] Pablo Fernandez: they are known to break easily
[2023-08-25T18:56:39] Pablo Fernandez: this will be also on the aproved list
[2023-08-25T18:56:46] Pablo Fernandez: all the "red bull" escooters lol
[2023-08-25T18:57:05] Pablo Fernandez: funny enough the aproved list is made by a lab located in italy not spain
[2023-08-25T18:57:24] sombre_enfant: Vesc refill
[2023-08-25T18:57:41] Gabe Enzo: fake Xiaomi?
[2023-08-25T18:58:05] Gabe Enzo: Ah yes, honeycomb tyres approved for high speed road use
[2023-08-25T18:58:12] Gabe Enzo: üóø
[2023-08-25T18:58:18] Pablo Fernandez: no idea, is named red bull race
[2023-08-25T19:00:18] Mirono escooters: On sale now on ali too
[2023-08-25T19:03:11] Happy Giraffe: Pekk is the new wonder material
[2023-08-25T19:03:17] Happy Giraffe: Or peek
[2023-08-25T19:04:24] Happy Giraffe: Nah, get resonance tuning on Klipper and easy 200...
[2023-08-25T19:05:24] Happy Giraffe: But around battery you want impact resistance and not brittle stuff like PLA/PETG
[2023-08-25T19:15:15] AK: Kaboo displays should work
[2023-08-25T19:16:01] AK: I print abs at 350+ mms
[2023-08-25T19:16:28] AK: Just keep the surrounding temps warm
[2023-08-25T19:41:02] puneDir: Theyre so bad
[2023-08-25T19:41:10] puneDir: I once drove an g30 clone redbull
[2023-08-25T19:41:22] puneDir: It doesnt pulls nice and has the aliexpress ninebot suspension
[2023-08-25T20:29:48] Gabe Enzo: recommend me something
[2023-08-25T20:30:34] Gabe Enzo: For a battery spacer
[2023-08-25T20:31:23] Mirono escooters: Petg
[2023-08-25T20:31:27] Gabe Enzo: wdym by surrounding temps
[2023-08-25T20:31:40] Mirono escooters: Pla 100% not too brittle tho
[2023-08-25T20:31:56] Gabe Enzo: Any idea how I can stop warping? the only way I can combat it is fast printing.
[2023-08-25T20:32:03] Gabe Enzo: Maybe it's My glass bed
[2023-08-25T20:32:04] Mirono escooters: Wtf
[2023-08-25T20:32:12] Mirono escooters: You warp pla???
[2023-08-25T20:32:15] Gabe Enzo: Yes.
[2023-08-25T20:32:20] Mirono escooters: Nop I print everything on glass
[2023-08-25T20:32:28] Gabe Enzo: my spacer is warped, I had to shave it off
[2023-08-25T20:32:30] Gabe Enzo: So it fits
[2023-08-25T20:32:37] Mirono escooters: Start cleaning glass, soap. Levelijg And if you can't resist use some 3dtac spray glue
[2023-08-25T20:33:28] Happy Giraffe: PETG is good as it handles a bit higher heat. I originally meant a protective case for battery to be something more impact resistant
[2023-08-25T20:33:45] Mirono escooters: Theoretically tpu very good. Shock absorbing
[2023-08-25T20:33:52] Mirono escooters: Tight fit ezpz
[2023-08-25T20:36:36] Gabe Enzo: might pay someone to print it for me from PETG.
[2023-08-25T20:36:42] Gabe Enzo: Hm
[2023-08-25T20:46:44] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: Guys In UK ! This scooter is going on offer now for ¬£4800 ! Anyone interested drop me a message ! Only UK cause I can deliver it personally ! Can‚Äôt ship outside UK as I‚Äôm afraid that the scooter will get damaged on transit!
[2023-08-25T20:56:55] Happy Giraffe: Yeah its crazy strong and people underrate it
[2023-08-25T20:57:17] Mirono escooters: For my cinewhoop drone perfeeect
[2023-08-25T20:57:39] KierreKikkeli: Uhh guys, i tried to re solder the transistor leg on my new spintend 100A vesc as it came barely on, and somehow this happened, anyway to fix it so they wont short or will they short in the first place?
[2023-08-25T20:58:02] Mirono escooters: Transistor leg?
[2023-08-25T20:58:05] Mirono escooters: Cap you mean?
[2023-08-25T20:58:23] Mirono escooters: Seems like trace is off?,
[2023-08-25T20:58:25] KierreKikkeli: The contact
[2023-08-25T20:58:28] Mirono escooters: Welp, time to run with -1 cap
[2023-08-25T20:58:40] Mirono escooters: Why is that connector left from it half mekted
[2023-08-25T20:58:51] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_9413@25-08-2023_20-58-51.jpg>
[2023-08-25T20:58:56] KierreKikkeli: The trace somehow expanded after taking contact with the small brown transistor
[2023-08-25T20:59:03] Mirono escooters: Check if that cap is to + (idk from head If yes , then solder to the ceramic cap
[2023-08-25T20:59:07] Mirono escooters: Be careful. They brittle
[2023-08-25T20:59:18] Mirono escooters: Alupcb takes a lot of heat xd
[2023-08-25T20:59:25] Mirono escooters: Multimeteria beep boop
[2023-08-25T21:00:05] Happy Giraffe: Last option to send it to spintend as their stock soldering was so shit it had to be fiddled with + solder balls
[2023-08-25T21:00:23] KierreKikkeli: How where
[2023-08-25T21:01:22] KierreKikkeli: Ye hope they take it xd
[2023-08-25T21:02:10] Mirono escooters: Bruh..
[2023-08-25T21:02:20] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_9414@25-08-2023_21-02-20.jpg>

[2023-08-25T21:04:48] Mirono escooters: Bro wtf
[2023-08-25T21:04:54] Mirono escooters: Multimeter on beep modus
[2023-08-25T21:05:05] Mirono escooters: And test if the good capacitor soldered pad blabla beeps
[2023-08-25T21:05:11] Mirono escooters: If yes you can solder leg to cap
[2023-08-25T21:05:13] Mirono escooters: Idk from head
[2023-08-25T21:05:35] Mirono escooters: Ugga clean this solderball
[2023-08-25T21:09:21] KierreKikkeli: Dont own guess need to go buy one tomorrow
[2023-08-25T21:10:14] KierreKikkeli: Theres 0,01mm layer of solder there no ball
[2023-08-25T21:10:18] Mirono escooters: Ow that's basic ywu
[2023-08-25T21:10:20] Gabe Enzo: I stole mine from the local mall.
[2023-08-25T21:10:28] Gabe Enzo: Turned out to be useful years later
[2023-08-25T21:10:39] Gabe Enzo: Kleptomania go wee

[2023-08-25T21:10:53] KierreKikkeli: Xd
[2023-08-25T21:11:08] Gabe Enzo: one of those balls fried my entire controller
[2023-08-25T21:11:14] Gabe Enzo: BEWARE of balls
[2023-08-25T21:11:53] Happy Giraffe: I stop recommending spintend at this point, the fucks cant listen to customers telling to QC
[2023-08-25T21:12:04] KierreKikkeli: Ah found it ye my bad
[2023-08-25T21:12:04] Mirono escooters: XD

[2023-08-25T21:12:21] Gabe Enzo: nice pfp
[2023-08-25T21:12:38] Happy Giraffe: Company makes mistake > user has to fiddle around, if goes bad its product kaboom > profit
[2023-08-25T21:12:55] KierreKikkeli: Ty ty issa my logo
[2023-08-25T21:13:15] KierreKikkeli: üòÇ
[2023-08-25T21:13:44] Happy Giraffe: Clean the messed up solder away with a little of flux
[2023-08-25T21:14:10] Happy Giraffe: Then the parts wont short
[2023-08-25T21:14:54] KierreKikkeli: Yeah need to get some tomorrow, brain shorted while in store and didnt get any, gonna try to use the copper wire thingy, also need to get a multimeter -.-
[2023-08-25T21:15:49] KierreKikkeli: Also the contact is for a +
[2023-08-25T21:16:20] Happy Giraffe: If soldering iron doesnt melt solder in 2 seconds theres something wrong. Gotta get some stranded copper ball to clean the tip

[2023-08-25T21:19:01] Mirono escooters: Just.. get to someone with pro soldering skills before it's gone
[2023-08-25T21:19:07] Mirono escooters: Its repairable. most likely the trace is fine
[2023-08-25T21:19:45] KierreKikkeli: Yeah sounds like a plan, at this point i have no clue wtf im doing wrong but something has to be wrong
[2023-08-25T21:20:08] Mirono escooters: (atleast carbonfiber makes my print bling bling) üòé
[2023-08-25T21:20:13] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-08-25T21:20:25] Happy Giraffe: And possibly weaker than regular plaüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-08-25T21:21:36] Mirono escooters: Bwuh
[2023-08-25T21:23:41] KierreKikkeli: Xd
[2023-08-25T21:25:40] KierreKikkeli: But yeah ive made my own e cigs without issues, ive fixed boards, re made the electrics to my first ever trisonic electric guitar, built charging station speaker chair powered by car batreries, everything has worked and looked fine, but for whatever reason i have issues with this mofo i blame the alu pcb XD
[2023-08-25T21:29:11] Gabe Enzo: Don't make vapes, if you do the wrong math based on coil size you will get an explosion near your mouth
[2023-08-25T21:29:42] Gabe Enzo: Just buy pre made lol
[2023-08-25T21:30:04] Gabe Enzo: Way to risky
[2023-08-25T21:30:52] KierreKikkeli: ive been in the business ever since ego sticks and have a nick name "vape guru" coz im the best in these parts
[2023-08-25T21:31:17] Gabe Enzo: Lol I remember ego sticks were the shit In 2015
[2023-08-25T21:31:22] KierreKikkeli: 0 issues ever, even ran an underground do it all vape business for like 7 years until undercover police cathced me XD
[2023-08-25T21:31:29] KierreKikkeli: 2012*
[2023-08-25T21:31:37] KierreKikkeli: 2013 came mechanical tubes
[2023-08-25T21:31:50] KierreKikkeli: and i had akuma
[2023-08-25T21:31:53] KierreKikkeli: XD
[2023-08-25T21:32:18] KierreKikkeli: and once made a frankenstein circuit e cig from 3-4 different broken ecigs and called it hand granade
[2023-08-25T21:32:24] Gabe Enzo: I gave up on vapes, issues with every single one. Leaking, coils burning when taking regular sessions, e Juice tasting like shit.
[2023-08-25T21:32:31] Gabe Enzo: Disposables are good but cause lung cancer
[2023-08-25T21:32:48] Gabe Enzo: They have this chemical in them called diacetyl that makes them taste so fucking good
[2023-08-25T21:32:54] Gabe Enzo: So so so fucking good
[2023-08-25T21:33:00] KierreKikkeli: i sold so much liquids back in the day i got taste blindness for every artificial flavour xd
[2023-08-25T21:33:10] KierreKikkeli: XDDDDDD
[2023-08-25T21:33:17] KierreKikkeli: i ve been an rda guy always
[2023-08-25T21:33:30] KierreKikkeli: i tried tanks and the rda hybrid tank shit
[2023-08-25T21:33:33] Gabe Enzo: There's this one that tastes like chewing an entire mouthful of skittles
[2023-08-25T21:33:49] Gabe Enzo: But not overexaggerating
[2023-08-25T21:34:00] KierreKikkeli: not my thing, always issues, and i bought the last copy of nuke rda in the whole world and it broke down 2 years ago :C
[2023-08-25T21:34:08] KierreKikkeli: yeah i know
[2023-08-25T21:34:12] KierreKikkeli: theres multiple like it
[2023-08-25T21:34:27] KierreKikkeli: i sold around 2 liters of liquids in the batches of 10-100ml a month
[2023-08-25T21:34:55] KierreKikkeli: and had 20-30 rotating flavours per month and had to taste test em all
[2023-08-25T21:35:17] KierreKikkeli: hence perma taste blindness since like 2015 or so, and have been going no flavour since
[2023-08-25T21:35:31] KierreKikkeli: point being i should know my shit
[2023-08-25T21:35:34] KierreKikkeli: and i fail
[2023-08-25T21:35:41] KierreKikkeli: and i dont know why or how and it makes me mad i broke the thing
[2023-08-25T21:36:06] Gabe Enzo: what would you recommend for me? something that won't brake my wallet
[2023-08-25T21:36:12] Gabe Enzo: Like 40 dollars or 50 max
[2023-08-25T21:36:15] Gabe Enzo: something nice
[2023-08-25T21:36:26] Gabe Enzo: SMOK is shit
[2023-08-25T21:36:34] KierreKikkeli: uhh theres these sticks i cant remember with magnetic tanks
[2023-08-25T21:36:51] KierreKikkeli: that are a banger with that price range, i think they were smok XD
[2023-08-25T21:37:04] KierreKikkeli: but tbh smok and geekvape are the best brands
[2023-08-25T21:37:08] KierreKikkeli: most reliable
[2023-08-25T21:37:31] Gabe Enzo: True
[2023-08-25T21:37:31] KierreKikkeli: in finland its illegal to sell e cigs online or anything related
[2023-08-25T21:37:40] KierreKikkeli: hence cant even look it up
[2023-08-25T21:37:52] KierreKikkeli: we also pay 10‚Ç¨/10ml of 20mg base :)
[2023-08-25T21:38:05] KierreKikkeli: anything over is the most illegal thing in here XD
[2023-08-25T21:38:18] Gabe Enzo: vapes are great when doing the deed with someone
[2023-08-25T21:38:19] KierreKikkeli: hence i had undercover police stalk and track me down when i was 18
[2023-08-25T21:38:21] Gabe Enzo: if you know what I mean
[2023-08-25T21:38:24] KierreKikkeli: yes
[2023-08-25T21:38:29] KierreKikkeli: absolute bangers
[2023-08-25T21:38:32] KierreKikkeli: huehuehue
[2023-08-25T21:38:39] Gabe Enzo: Hehe you know exactly what I mean
[2023-08-25T21:39:10] KierreKikkeli: i actually just found a smuggler yesterday for 100mg nicotine base so imma get back in it
[2023-08-25T21:39:21] KierreKikkeli: if u want relieable go for geek vapoe aegis
[2023-08-25T21:39:46] KierreKikkeli: i actually have a commercial for it too
[2023-08-25T21:40:10] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9422@25-08-2023_21-40-10.jpg>
[2023-08-25T21:40:34] KierreKikkeli: had to make it in school
[2023-08-25T21:40:41] KierreKikkeli: but ye, thats my most recommended thing
[2023-08-25T21:40:59] KierreKikkeli: god damn immortal mods cased in aluminium and more aluminium and plastic seals
[2023-08-25T21:41:05] KierreKikkeli: no liquid in the pcb ever
[2023-08-25T21:41:13] KierreKikkeli: screen brakes? no matter still works
[2023-08-25T21:41:40] KierreKikkeli: <video_file>
[2023-08-25T21:44:25] Gabe Enzo: You can get nicotine powder no?
[2023-08-25T21:44:39] KierreKikkeli: most illegal substance here
[2023-08-25T21:44:50] KierreKikkeli: goes over heroine and cocaine
[2023-08-25T21:44:57] Gabe Enzo: I used to make vapes from 21700s before it was a thing
[2023-08-25T21:45:10] KierreKikkeli: my friend made a mechanical mod with 12 of em XD
[2023-08-25T21:45:18] Gabe Enzo: also made an Ego 21700. Think it lasted about 3 weeks on a charge
[2023-08-25T21:45:24] Gabe Enzo: Lol
[2023-08-25T21:45:25] KierreKikkeli: i also had one that was 40cm high
[2023-08-25T21:45:30] KierreKikkeli: XD
[2023-08-25T21:45:42] Gabe Enzo: how is nicotine illegal?
[2023-08-25T21:45:43] KierreKikkeli: but ye
[2023-08-25T21:45:45] Gabe Enzo: are cigarettes legal
[2023-08-25T21:45:53] KierreKikkeli: yes and nicotine pouches
[2023-08-25T21:46:00] Gabe Enzo: Ah, how sensible
[2023-08-25T21:46:06] KierreKikkeli: but they practically made vapes 20x pricier in 2017
[2023-08-25T21:46:12] KierreKikkeli: by law
[2023-08-25T21:46:17] KierreKikkeli: and anything over 20mg illegal
[2023-08-25T21:46:23] KierreKikkeli: and nicotin base illegal,
[2023-08-25T21:46:23] Gabe Enzo: what do you think of vaporesso?
[2023-08-25T21:46:38] Gabe Enzo: Ya same. You cant get a buzz off the 20mg dispos
[2023-08-25T21:46:42] KierreKikkeli: no clue, havent been in the scene since 2018
[2023-08-25T21:46:57] KierreKikkeli: ordering anything is also illegal
[2023-08-25T21:47:05] KierreKikkeli: and like 99% of flavours
[2023-08-25T21:47:28] KierreKikkeli: i used to use pinkmule purple and grey label
[2023-08-25T21:48:10] Gabe Enzo: do you believe in juice causing lung illness? I don't at all. There's been a craze about it since 2020 because of people claiming they got pneumonia because of vaping. what they DIDN'T say was they vaped BLACK MARKET CARTS
[2023-08-25T21:48:22] Gabe Enzo: and of course disposables
[2023-08-25T21:48:40] Gabe Enzo: I even vaped back when I believed it so idc
[2023-08-25T21:48:57] KierreKikkeli: it does cause lungs getting filled and less effective but thats about it
[2023-08-25T21:49:17] KierreKikkeli: go without it for like 2 months after heavy use for 5 years and all good
[2023-08-25T21:49:38] KierreKikkeli: when i was doing business i stopped using flavours coz i didnt taste em and started to cough rainbows
[2023-08-25T21:50:02] Gabe Enzo: I don't rly believe in smoke causing illness at all üòÇ I've smoked weed, cigs and vaped since 14 and I can hold my breath for 3 minutes.
[2023-08-25T21:50:07] Gabe Enzo: All a sham
[2023-08-25T21:50:13] KierreKikkeli: 10-11 for me
[2023-08-25T21:50:25] KierreKikkeli: but i also smoke the strongest there is
[2023-08-25T21:50:36] KierreKikkeli: red cigs from a pipe
[2023-08-25T21:50:43] KierreKikkeli: 6mg in rda
[2023-08-25T21:51:13] KierreKikkeli: 11-20mg nicotine puches and so on
[2023-08-25T21:51:19] KierreKikkeli: also biggu clouds
[2023-08-25T21:51:42] KierreKikkeli: so im prob speedrunning lung issues i guess
[2023-08-25T21:52:05] Gabe Enzo: Smoke combustion in moderation and you'll never get Ill
[2023-08-25T21:52:16] Gabe Enzo: Its like drink once a week for the rest of your life and you will never get liver failure
[2023-08-25T21:52:20] Gabe Enzo: Ever
[2023-08-25T21:52:23] Gabe Enzo: Cause lungs heal
[2023-08-25T21:52:24] KierreKikkeli: yeah
[2023-08-25T21:52:31] KierreKikkeli: i just dont let it
[2023-08-25T22:00:50] Happy Giraffe: Guys go to private, this isnt even remotely attached to the subject of groupüòÅ
[2023-08-25T22:01:00] KierreKikkeli: true
[2023-08-26T11:14:33] Face de Pin Suc√©: <video_file>
[2023-08-26T11:17:20] Pablo Fernandez: for a second i thought that was the nami from the indian guy that smashed it the other day for the second time
[2023-08-26T11:20:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: @jamessoderstrom, this is what I was working on these days
[2023-08-26T11:25:21] Pablo Fernandez: do you like the alu/steel stem more over the carbon fiber one? i guess less flex is better for racing
[2023-08-26T11:26:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Nami‚Äôs carbon stem is weak
[2023-08-26T11:27:19] Pablo Fernandez: yup i dont like the flex it has, and also i always find carbon (even more chinese carbon) sketchy
[2023-08-26T11:32:10] Gabe Enzo: Carbon bikes smash into pieces when crashed. I assume the stem will also cripple.
[2023-08-26T11:33:04] Pablo Fernandez: nothing against ciclist but they will spend 4k on a carbon piece that will reduce 2 grams the weight and then eat a whole baguette before riding
[2023-08-26T11:33:28] Gabe Enzo: Oh yeah the whole thing is insanity.
[2023-08-26T11:52:24] Happy Giraffe: I dont understand that carbon is so light why not make it 10% shicker for strenghtüåö
[2023-08-26T11:52:29] Luis Magalhaes: I work with one cyclist that has a bike os 6 or 7k, dont seem to eat a lot as he has 50kg and some times he diets to have a little less then that üòÇ
[2023-08-26T11:53:29] Luis Magalhaes: I think just saying it is carbon sells üòÇsome guys like to say my scooter has carbon üòú
[2023-08-26T11:54:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: They put carbon because of looking not weight, with the alu pole inside of carbon stem is heavy as normal stem lol
[2023-08-26T12:01:04] Pablo Fernandez: Yeah is literally like an alu stem hydro dipped
[2023-08-26T12:08:58] KierreKikkeli: @Mirono_escooters @Happy_Giraffe
[2023-08-26T12:19:46] Mirono escooters: You misunderstood
[2023-08-26T12:20:20] Mirono escooters: Beep these 2
[2023-08-26T12:20:25] Mirono escooters: If they beep
[2023-08-26T12:20:32] Mirono escooters: You can solder your broken capacitor leg thing to
[2023-08-26T12:20:49] Mirono escooters: This
[2023-08-26T12:22:04] KierreKikkeli: The side of the smoll one and the trace for the capacitor? And or the capacitor leg
[2023-08-26T12:22:36] Mirono escooters: Cap leg to side of smol one
[2023-08-26T12:22:47] KierreKikkeli: Did try
[2023-08-26T12:22:51] KierreKikkeli: No beep
[2023-08-26T12:23:06] Mirono escooters: Between this??
[2023-08-26T12:25:31] KierreKikkeli: Yes
[2023-08-26T12:29:20] Mirono escooters: No beep?
[2023-08-26T12:29:23] Mirono escooters: Im confused
[2023-08-26T12:29:27] Mirono escooters: I need coffee first
[2023-08-26T12:30:17] KierreKikkeli: Sending a vid
[2023-08-26T12:30:19] KierreKikkeli: No beep
[2023-08-26T12:30:53] Mirono escooters: Ah 2:30 min of jolly video
[2023-08-26T12:30:58] KierreKikkeli: Ayyy now beep
[2023-08-26T12:31:05] KierreKikkeli: Needed to press leg on the trace
[2023-08-26T12:31:18] KierreKikkeli: Vid useless
[2023-08-26T12:31:19] KierreKikkeli: Noe
[2023-08-26T12:35:40] KierreKikkeli: <video_file>
[2023-08-26T12:40:44] Happy Giraffe: And here am I wanting a steel frame for downhill ebike. Not a single alu or carbon frame can hold that much torque and power (300nm, 15kw)
[2023-08-26T12:41:48] Happy Giraffe: If I had a frame builder friend would be fantastic to just build the rear triangle that gets the abuseüòÅ
[2023-08-26T12:49:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_9424@26-08-2023_12-49-45.jpg>
[2023-08-26T12:49:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: @SibClimb
[2023-08-26T12:50:17] KierreKikkeli: xd
[2023-08-26T12:58:00] Happy Giraffe: Which vesc?
[2023-08-26T12:58:21] Mirono escooters: Yah see
[2023-08-26T12:58:51] Mirono escooters: Now solder the cap leg to the ceramic cap side
[2023-08-26T12:58:54] Mirono escooters: And it'll probably work
[2023-08-26T12:59:03] Mirono escooters: Or no, let someone else do üôàüôà
[2023-08-26T12:59:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: Hehehe
[2023-08-26T13:01:17] KierreKikkeli: i have no issues getting it soldered to the cap XD thats the one thing i've been trying to avoid and clean up
[2023-08-26T13:01:42] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-08-26T13:02:03] Happy Giraffe: Local tv/radio repair shop
[2023-08-26T13:02:15] KierreKikkeli: none
[2023-08-26T13:03:03] KierreKikkeli: would need to get into a train and go to the main capital or the ex main capital
[2023-08-26T13:03:13] KierreKikkeli: or i could try to bribe happy somehow
[2023-08-26T14:34:29] KierreKikkeli: Jesus christ finally it solders normally
[2023-08-26T14:35:20] KierreKikkeli: Only required 80w 500c iron and ammonium chloride stone
[2023-08-26T14:36:31] KierreKikkeli: Most likely coz trying to heat the soldering points resulted in the alu pcb taking the heat away unless overkill iron coz i did a sanity check with a normal pcb and wires without issues
[2023-08-26T14:48:33] KierreKikkeli: All caps and resistors reporting 1100 whatever units
[2023-08-26T14:48:41] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9428@26-08-2023_14-48-41.jpg>
[2023-08-26T15:15:39] KierreKikkeli: how do i confirm it still works? slap a battery and bt module in?
[2023-08-26T15:17:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Use a low power supply
[2023-08-26T15:18:21] KierreKikkeli: as in? single cell 18650, pc psu or will a 20A 12S 44V work?
[2023-08-26T15:18:32] Happy Giraffe: Like a 12v 0.5A used on most devices?üòÅ
[2023-08-26T15:19:42] Happy Giraffe: The normal bms wont limit the output current. If shorted it will do whatever peak current its resistance allows like ~250A and burns components
[2023-08-26T15:20:25] KierreKikkeli: issa smart bms as far as i know
[2023-08-26T15:20:53] KierreKikkeli: but will a phone charger work for example in the usb c port????? or do i need to start crafting some odd battery
[2023-08-26T15:21:55] KierreKikkeli: i also have the 120A fuse
[2023-08-26T15:24:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: at least 30v i suggest
[2023-08-26T15:25:18] KierreKikkeli: so xiaomi essential stock battery?
[2023-08-26T15:25:53] Happy Giraffe: You dont wanna use a battery for the reason I just toldüòÖ
[2023-08-26T15:26:11] Happy Giraffe: 0.5A psu wont burn as aggressive if something is wrong
[2023-08-26T15:26:27] Happy Giraffe: Try 12v if you don't have anything else
[2023-08-26T15:26:56] KierreKikkeli: yeah but does like a phone charger suffice for it?
[2023-08-26T15:27:49] Happy Giraffe: Thats where usb protocol triggers step it, I bet you cant
[2023-08-26T15:29:06] KierreKikkeli: so i need a 12v 0.5A xt60 connected power supply
[2023-08-26T15:29:07] Happy Giraffe: But first test continuity mode with multimeter that it doesnt short components
[2023-08-26T15:29:34] Happy Giraffe: I mean you propably have 10 of those already
[2023-08-26T15:30:03] KierreKikkeli: phone batteries and 18650's yes
[2023-08-26T15:30:52] KierreKikkeli: but thats about that, other than that i have old pc psu's
[2023-08-26T15:31:17] KierreKikkeli: test where and how, the resistor and caps dont short, xt60 connector doesnt short
[2023-08-26T15:31:57] KierreKikkeli: ah u mean like these?
[2023-08-26T15:32:06] KierreKikkeli: strap and solder to a xt60
[2023-08-26T15:32:08] KierreKikkeli: ?
[2023-08-26T15:34:12] Happy Giraffe: Yeah if you have laying around. Better not to try motor with those but just to turn vesc on
[2023-08-26T15:34:41] Happy Giraffe: Someone who knows PCBs better could help testing it
[2023-08-26T15:36:20] KierreKikkeli: my friends dad actually could, completely forgot his existence, dudes like 1/3 large scale telescope/microscope engineers in the whole world XD
[2023-08-26T15:37:58] KierreKikkeli: actually would these work instead of femlae xt60 as they dont seem to sell em locally
[2023-08-26T15:38:01] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9430@26-08-2023_15-38-01.jpg>
[2023-08-26T15:39:23] puneDir: i want to design a vesc for small scooter something has specs like xiaomi esc and cheap
[2023-08-26T15:39:29] puneDir: where and how can i start
[2023-08-26T15:39:36] puneDir: is there any guidelines?
[2023-08-26T15:40:11] puneDir: i want something 100v 60a
[2023-08-26T15:40:14] puneDir: or 100v 100a
[2023-08-26T15:40:26] puneDir: but something can be fully done for 30-40 euros
[2023-08-26T15:43:23] Happy Giraffe: I mean you have xt90 on vesc so same diameter bullet connector on other side works
[2023-08-26T15:43:40] Happy Giraffe: Atleast just for the test
[2023-08-26T15:44:16] Happy Giraffe: You cant, the cpu alone is a lotüòÇ impossible for that amount of money
[2023-08-26T15:44:33] puneDir: whats the min price?
[2023-08-26T15:44:57] puneDir: idc that for now
[2023-08-26T15:45:03] puneDir: how can i start
[2023-08-26T15:49:23] KierreKikkeli: around 100$ as i was suggested to, and now regret going for a 300$ one instead xd
[2023-08-26T15:49:48] puneDir: where can i start?
[2023-08-26T15:50:29] Happy Giraffe: Waste of time
[2023-08-26T15:50:50] Happy Giraffe: Just buy a cheap vesc
[2023-08-26T15:51:16] puneDir: i just wanna do
[2023-08-26T15:51:31] puneDir: were planning to build and sell scooters on turkish market
[2023-08-26T15:51:41] puneDir: i want to build esc for it
[2023-08-26T15:59:51] Happy Giraffe: Btw what is the best smart bms? Ant? I will want one with absolute reliability and usually see lot of posts with people having problems with smart onesüåö
[2023-08-26T16:09:59] Mirono escooters: Jkbms or ant
[2023-08-26T16:51:20] KierreKikkeli: Ayy got a few pairs of xt60's from the telescope engineer friend
[2023-08-26T16:52:02] KierreKikkeli: He also said he has time after few weeks if i want to check it with him, and that he had xt90's until yesterday xdddd
[2023-08-26T16:52:40] KierreKikkeli: Also promised to teach me how to make diy batteries for the escoot if i want ü§î
[2023-08-26T16:54:28] Happy Giraffe: Pls no
[2023-08-26T16:54:35] KierreKikkeli: He has the equipment is willing to teach me how to make my own from aliexpress and mictowaves xd
[2023-08-26T16:54:55] Happy Giraffe: Yeah you gotta change xt90 for battery aswell. Atleast an adapter for antispark xt90
[2023-08-26T16:55:06] KierreKikkeli: Also laughed when i told him its spintend xd
[2023-08-26T16:55:18] KierreKikkeli: Yeah
[2023-08-26T16:56:52] KierreKikkeli: linked me this xd https://vesc-project.com/?fbclid=IwAR3IgpNvQYK91-O87c6UmbDLXpP6U5LRXe9iNMu62dltg0rT78cTdBqNYMU
[2023-08-26T16:57:44] KierreKikkeli: imma change the vesc xt90 to 60
[2023-08-26T16:57:59] KierreKikkeli: and when big battery slap the xt 90 back
[2023-08-26T17:00:16] Happy Giraffe: No way, rather change batt to 90
[2023-08-26T17:00:28] Happy Giraffe: Or make 60-90 antispark adapter
[2023-08-26T17:00:49] Happy Giraffe: Takes like 15mins
[2023-08-26T17:04:00] KierreKikkeli: Dont have female 90
[2023-08-26T17:04:52] KierreKikkeli: But has 60's now
[2023-08-26T17:05:14] KierreKikkeli: Also wheres the heat shrink in the vesc xt90? Xd
[2023-08-26T17:12:47] KierreKikkeli: Hmm will it work just like that or do i solder a smaller wire onto it
[2023-08-26T17:19:01] Happy Giraffe: Heat shrink
[2023-08-26T17:19:20] Happy Giraffe: Also you definitely want an xt90 as it has antispark function
[2023-08-26T17:20:09] KierreKikkeli: will it work?
[2023-08-26T17:21:27] KierreKikkeli: i could also just solder the psu wires into it bare no?
[2023-08-26T17:22:47] Happy Giraffe: I mean you aint gonna leave bare wiresüòÅ
[2023-08-26T17:23:22] Happy Giraffe: Thick wire is ok there or you can cut a bit of strands away
[2023-08-26T17:23:46] KierreKikkeli: i mean yeah ofc
[2023-08-26T17:24:07] KierreKikkeli: i would need to cut like 60% of em off XD
[2023-08-26T17:28:01] KierreKikkeli: As in that much off??
[2023-08-26T17:28:48] Happy Giraffe: Nope, you are still limited by xt60 current capabilities so it doesnt matter
[2023-08-26T17:29:08] Happy Giraffe: Btw is this Amass¬Æ branded?
[2023-08-26T17:29:57] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: I guess it's cheap ali xts with brand "ly"
[2023-08-26T17:30:06] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Or what chinesiums sells
[2023-08-26T17:30:10] KierreKikkeli: no brand anywhere
[2023-08-26T17:30:15] KierreKikkeli: but most likely yea
[2023-08-26T17:30:39] KierreKikkeli: aliexpress
[2023-08-26T17:37:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: It is titanium
[2023-08-26T17:42:47] Happy Giraffe: Then its even less current capable than real xt60, rather get real xt90
[2023-08-26T17:43:05] Happy Giraffe: For your current battery it matters less but for the future
[2023-08-26T17:43:23] Mirono escooters: Yah amass and china is very clear quality diff
[2023-08-26T17:43:30] Mirono escooters: Next to each other, feel, look, even weights
[2023-08-26T17:44:20] KierreKikkeli: yeah imma buy an actual xt90 for the future
[2023-08-26T17:44:59] puneDir: I have amass one insane quality
[2023-08-26T17:45:25] KierreKikkeli: how do u tell em apart from good and bad quality?
[2023-08-26T17:45:49] Mirono escooters: You see and feel
[2023-08-26T17:45:58] Mirono escooters: Tbh I use cheap xt60 for low power shizl can't lie
[2023-08-26T17:46:42] Mirono escooters: Cnhl had a sale , and cheaper then clone lol
[2023-08-26T17:46:59] KierreKikkeli: xddd
[2023-08-26T17:47:14] KierreKikkeli: ah no hope for me then xdf
[2023-08-26T17:47:40] KierreKikkeli: might be good ones tho
[2023-08-26T17:47:54] KierreKikkeli: dude uses em for high voltage rc car batteries and diy stuff like that
[2023-08-26T17:48:34] Mirono escooters: It'll be fiine
[2023-08-26T17:48:38] Mirono escooters: Even clones like powr
[2023-08-26T17:50:56] Happy Giraffe: One has amass and other doesnt. One burns easier and faster
[2023-08-26T17:56:56] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>

[2023-08-26T17:59:18] Mirono escooters: Since when they release so many new vescs?
[2023-08-26T18:00:39] Happy Giraffe: Should release 10x less quantity and 10x more quality
[2023-08-26T18:00:45] Mirono escooters: 66√ó93mm
[2023-08-26T18:00:52] Mirono escooters: Bwah. They good enough
[2023-08-26T18:01:00] Mirono escooters: Bought 6 75100 lol, cheap af on sale
[2023-08-26T18:01:26] Gabe Enzo: how much did one cost?
[2023-08-26T18:01:36] Mirono escooters: Close to 70‚Ç¨ for alupcb
[2023-08-26T18:01:39] Mirono escooters: And 55 for regular
[2023-08-26T18:01:48] Mirono escooters: Das no money. Can't even make it yourself that cheap
[2023-08-26T18:01:53] Mirono escooters: Heck, a Xiaomi Esc is more
[2023-08-26T18:01:59] Gabe Enzo: True LOL
[2023-08-26T18:02:08] Gabe Enzo: Are they 75100?
[2023-08-26T18:02:17] Gabe Enzo: if you have any left I can buy one?
[2023-08-26T18:02:27] Mirono escooters: Yeh sure, but you can directly from ali too
[2023-08-26T18:02:34] Gabe Enzo: Would those not be fake
[2023-08-26T18:02:38] Gabe Enzo: Like... its aliexpress
[2023-08-26T18:02:44] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-08-26T18:02:45] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-08-26T18:02:49] Mirono escooters: You buy from official store
[2023-08-26T18:03:10] Gabe Enzo: does flipsky sell to AliExpress
[2023-08-26T18:03:11] Gabe Enzo: orrr
[2023-08-26T18:03:28] Mirono escooters: https://a.aliexpress.com/_mMpu9QQ Regular one https://a.aliexpress.com/_mNyXdRu Alupcb. Defenitely get this over regular if you have the space for it
[2023-08-26T18:03:35] Gabe Enzo: what's the difference
[2023-08-26T18:03:36] Mirono escooters: No, they sell ON it
[2023-08-26T18:03:40] Mirono escooters: It's eBay for china
[2023-08-26T18:03:43] Gabe Enzo: Ohhh
[2023-08-26T18:03:48] Mirono escooters: Alupcb has better cooling
[2023-08-26T18:03:58] Mirono escooters: More powr
[2023-08-26T18:04:11] Gabe Enzo: How do you bolt vescs onto scooter frames if they don't have holes for it
[2023-08-26T18:04:17] Gabe Enzo: no way to get it secure
[2023-08-26T18:04:24] Mirono escooters: The regular pcb has tabs You drill tap mount
[2023-08-26T18:04:28] Mirono escooters: 3D clamp I use
[2023-08-26T18:04:33] Mirono escooters: Or thermal tape/glue works fine
[2023-08-26T18:04:55] Mirono escooters: Shipped with vat for that price üíÄ
[2023-08-26T18:04:58] Gabe Enzo: They HAVE to make vesc for hobby RC
[2023-08-26T18:05:02] Mirono escooters: Bwah
[2023-08-26T18:05:07] Mirono escooters: No point
[2023-08-26T18:05:17] Gabe Enzo: woah
[2023-08-26T18:05:23] Mirono escooters: Rc car Esc are cheap, noob proof (it's so simple)
[2023-08-26T18:05:37] Mirono escooters: Get one üòÇ so worth it
[2023-08-26T18:05:47] Gabe Enzo: as soon as this xesc fries.
[2023-08-26T18:05:52] Gabe Enzo: Yes
[2023-08-26T18:06:01] Gabe Enzo: Might get dual vesc
[2023-08-26T18:06:12] Gabe Enzo: Does vesc support e brake?
[2023-08-26T18:06:14] Gabe Enzo: btw
[2023-08-26T18:06:24] Mirono escooters: Get 2, and over CAN
[2023-08-26T18:06:25] Happy Giraffe: Lmao
[2023-08-26T18:06:30] Mirono escooters: Obv
[2023-08-26T18:06:39] Mirono escooters: Xesc?
[2023-08-26T18:06:56] Gabe Enzo: And it won't fry if I brake on max speed yes? cause that's my issue with Xiaomi ESC
[2023-08-26T18:07:11] Gabe Enzo: Xiaomi ESC. I coined the term because I'm so lazy to type
[2023-08-26T18:07:34] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-08-26T18:07:37] Mirono escooters: Aight
[2023-08-26T18:07:41] Mirono escooters: You got 3 to burn üò≠üíÄ
[2023-08-26T18:07:48] Mirono escooters: No, it's better
[2023-08-26T18:07:54] Mirono escooters: As long as your BMS doesn't cut üòß
[2023-08-26T18:08:00] Gabe Enzo: its shunted
[2023-08-26T18:08:02] Gabe Enzo: LOL
[2023-08-26T18:08:04] Mirono escooters: I have bad memories of slamming ebrake on Xiaomi
[2023-08-26T18:08:04] Gabe Enzo: It won't
[2023-08-26T18:08:12] Happy Giraffe: Summer soon ends so it becomes harder
[2023-08-26T18:08:18] Mirono escooters: Yah
[2023-08-26T18:08:20] Gabe Enzo: Yeah it fried my BRAND new XESC that I spent 50 hours on
[2023-08-26T18:08:36] Gabe Enzo: I thought It was the caps being too far away
[2023-08-26T18:08:36] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-08-26T18:08:37] Gabe Enzo: but no
[2023-08-26T18:08:46] Gabe Enzo: remember I was so confused why it blew
[2023-08-26T18:08:47] Gabe Enzo: Lol
[2023-08-26T18:08:53] Gabe Enzo: Now it all make sense
[2023-08-26T18:09:04] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2023-08-26T18:20:29] KierreKikkeli: ok yea, low quality xt 60's
[2023-08-26T18:20:53] KierreKikkeli: when i solder it the plastic melts and the pins go wonky XD
[2023-08-26T18:21:10] Gabe Enzo: Too much heat and not using flux.
[2023-08-26T18:21:18] Gabe Enzo: soldering for too long
[2023-08-26T18:21:41] KierreKikkeli: tried to use flux
[2023-08-26T18:21:42] Gabe Enzo: You can trim the hairs on the end of the low awg wire to make it stick easier.
[2023-08-26T18:21:46] KierreKikkeli: too much heat prob
[2023-08-26T18:22:01] Gabe Enzo: with this trick you can solder 8awg onto xt60
[2023-08-26T18:22:06] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9437@26-08-2023_18-22-06.jpg>
[2023-08-26T18:22:14] Gabe Enzo: Don't use that
[2023-08-26T18:22:27] Gabe Enzo: it'll go loose when you unplug
[2023-08-26T18:22:53] Gabe Enzo: Do my trimming trick on the other side
[2023-08-26T18:22:56] Gabe Enzo: You'll see
[2023-08-26T18:23:06] Gabe Enzo: but keep the middle hairs so it's not off
[2023-08-26T18:23:15] Gabe Enzo: get rid of 20-50%
[2023-08-26T18:23:19] KierreKikkeli: already trimmed it
[2023-08-26T18:23:27] KierreKikkeli: by 50% from the side xd
[2023-08-26T18:23:30] Gabe Enzo: Also do you tin the wire before you solder it on
[2023-08-26T18:23:35] KierreKikkeli: ye
[2023-08-26T18:23:38] KierreKikkeli: and the connector
[2023-08-26T18:23:52] Mirono escooters: Oh boy
[2023-08-26T18:24:16] KierreKikkeli: the whole bit is fucked XD
[2023-08-26T18:24:24] Mirono escooters: Too cold, too little flux
[2023-08-26T18:24:29] Happy Giraffe: How are you gonna heatshrink it now?üòÖ
[2023-08-26T18:24:33] Mirono escooters: Get lead solder w flux
[2023-08-26T18:24:37] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9438@26-08-2023_18-24-37.jpg>
[2023-08-26T18:24:39] Gabe Enzo: NOT lead
[2023-08-26T18:24:43] Gabe Enzo: bro
[2023-08-26T18:24:46] Mirono escooters: I think it's time we make a tutorial video how to solder xt60
[2023-08-26T18:24:49] Mirono escooters: Or YouTube time
[2023-08-26T18:24:51] Gabe Enzo: you read my mind
[2023-08-26T18:24:52] Mirono escooters: Bro it's ok
[2023-08-26T18:24:56] Gabe Enzo: I was about to say that
[2023-08-26T18:24:59] Gabe Enzo: hmm
[2023-08-26T18:25:00] KierreKikkeli: i did watch one xd
[2023-08-26T18:25:05] KierreKikkeli: also unleaded solder
[2023-08-26T18:25:08] Happy Giraffe: Doesnt make a difference imo
[2023-08-26T18:25:13] Gabe Enzo: Yeah
[2023-08-26T18:25:18] Mirono escooters: It solders way better and you'll die from car fumes and pesticides quicker
[2023-08-26T18:25:22] Mirono escooters: Okhe you do you
[2023-08-26T18:25:30] Mirono escooters: Can only recommend
[2023-08-26T18:25:32] Gabe Enzo: I'll make a video
[2023-08-26T18:25:44] Gabe Enzo: I'm smarter than the guy you watched by the looks of it
[2023-08-26T18:25:54] Happy Giraffe: I mean I had similar results with both when doing xt90s
[2023-08-26T18:25:57] Mirono escooters: You just need more training
[2023-08-26T18:26:09] KierreKikkeli: yeah, simple wires easier
[2023-08-26T18:26:10] Mirono escooters: But good gear is nr1
[2023-08-26T18:26:15] KierreKikkeli: and smoll ones
[2023-08-26T18:26:18] Mirono escooters: Yeah learn the basics
[2023-08-26T18:26:28] KierreKikkeli: those i seem to have, double checkd
[2023-08-26T18:26:31] Mirono escooters: Such smol, such petit
[2023-08-26T18:26:36] KierreKikkeli: seems like getting good gear is a lost cause
[2023-08-26T18:26:48] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2023-08-26T18:26:52] Gabe Enzo: No issue. can solder like God with a 10‚Ç¨ solderer
[2023-08-26T18:26:57] Happy Giraffe: Gear doesnt matter that much tho
[2023-08-26T18:27:01] Mirono escooters: I went from 10‚Ç¨ soldering iron to 300‚Ç¨ Soldering skills +30%
[2023-08-26T18:27:12] KierreKikkeli: as i constantly cleaned this tip, used tin, used flux, and the tip melted inside itself
[2023-08-26T18:27:12] Mirono escooters: Especially higher W
[2023-08-26T18:27:26] Mirono escooters: Oh well, opinions vary There are no soldering facts
[2023-08-26T18:27:27] Gabe Enzo: You're applying too much pressure to it.
[2023-08-26T18:27:31] Gabe Enzo: Yes.
[2023-08-26T18:27:40] KierreKikkeli: 0 pressure, wires in the air
[2023-08-26T18:27:49] Mirono escooters: Let it flow from its own
[2023-08-26T18:27:59] KierreKikkeli: i do
[2023-08-26T18:28:02] Happy Giraffe: With my new iron soldering awg10 wires together became easier but other than that no difference on smaller stuff like soldering connectors
[2023-08-26T18:28:09] Gabe Enzo: I'll make a video for you Kikkeli, I'm about to solder new phase plugs and switch my phase wires for silicone so you're in luck. Give me an hour.
[2023-08-26T18:28:14] Mirono escooters: When The solder is hot enough and the flux is working (flux. Really.) It'll just flow where it has tocgo
[2023-08-26T18:28:19] Mirono escooters: So cool to see
[2023-08-26T18:28:46] KierreKikkeli: yeah thats not the issue, issue is that the wires wont stay in place long enough as the plastic gives in
[2023-08-26T18:29:03] KierreKikkeli: And this happens
[2023-08-26T18:29:11] Mirono escooters: You solder too long
[2023-08-26T18:29:14] Mirono escooters: 3S max all u need
[2023-08-26T18:29:15] KierreKikkeli: Or this
[2023-08-26T18:29:20] Mirono escooters: Skill issue sry
[2023-08-26T18:29:24] KierreKikkeli: fair
[2023-08-26T18:29:39] Happy Giraffe: Presolder wire, presolder connector. Then just connect in 1 second and done
[2023-08-26T18:29:41] Mirono escooters: Das why I say high W
[2023-08-26T18:29:53] Gabe Enzo: <voice_message>
[2023-08-26T18:30:06] KierreKikkeli: this
[2023-08-26T18:30:10] KierreKikkeli: too xd
[2023-08-26T18:30:13] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-08-26T18:30:23] Gabe Enzo: Also good to add solder on the back so it's 100% absorbed
[2023-08-26T18:30:25] Mirono escooters: I never presolder connector Ez to put wire in, dump w solder
[2023-08-26T18:30:34] Happy Giraffe: Yea always
[2023-08-26T18:30:42] KierreKikkeli: i do that yes
[2023-08-26T18:31:07] Happy Giraffe: Makes life easyüòÅ
[2023-08-26T18:31:28] Mirono escooters: Goh
[2023-08-26T18:31:28] KierreKikkeli: y
[2023-08-26T18:31:35] Mirono escooters: If wire size is almost too thick for xt60
[2023-08-26T18:31:36] Mirono escooters: It helps
[2023-08-26T18:34:40] KierreKikkeli: yeah ive mainly worked with like stupid small connectors and punch hole pcbs
[2023-08-26T18:34:55] KierreKikkeli: and those pin connectors where u solder the pin and slap it in the plastic
[2023-08-26T18:35:02] KierreKikkeli: like fan header types and such
[2023-08-26T18:35:21] KierreKikkeli: switching to a smaller iron
[2023-08-26T18:36:01] Gabe Enzo: trim a percentage of the circumference of the strands.
[2023-08-26T18:36:18] Gabe Enzo: but more length of the wire than you think is needed so it heat shrinks right
[2023-08-26T18:36:21] Gabe Enzo: Its genius
[2023-08-26T18:38:18] KierreKikkeli: Used ur tips
[2023-08-26T18:38:31] KierreKikkeli: 3 seconds max on s 30w iron
[2023-08-26T18:38:48] KierreKikkeli: Wtf
[2023-08-26T18:41:12] KierreKikkeli: same with the other side
[2023-08-26T18:41:34] KierreKikkeli: used flux on both too
[2023-08-26T18:43:42] Gabe Enzo: Bad Connectors. Not all types are the same.
[2023-08-26T18:43:46] Gabe Enzo: Most likely
[2023-08-26T18:43:54] Gabe Enzo: Weak and high quality
[2023-08-26T18:44:21] Gabe Enzo: good ones are soft and made from nylon
[2023-08-26T18:44:45] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2023-08-26T18:44:57] KierreKikkeli: yeah these hard af
[2023-08-26T18:45:15] KierreKikkeli: made from some bs pbs plastic xd
[2023-08-26T18:45:26] Gabe Enzo: Hobbyking.com has the best Connectors. Been using them since 2015 when into RC
[2023-08-26T18:45:50] Gabe Enzo: guaranteed top quality every single time
[2023-08-26T18:45:52] Gabe Enzo: but expensive.
[2023-08-26T18:46:49] KierreKikkeli: yeah, i fixed the connector and gonna re try with smaller wire

[2023-08-26T19:28:51] KierreKikkeli: Might also be bacho's tin, as soon as i take the iron away it turns to that
[2023-08-26T19:51:34] Gabe Enzo: No no no no
[2023-08-26T19:51:36] Gabe Enzo: no

[2023-08-26T19:54:27] KierreKikkeli: id like to remind you i rewired my first ever made trisonic guitar with lost electrical layouts that had 4 wires + connected ground on all mics and it ended up perfectly, yet fail horribly with this
[2023-08-26T19:54:31] KierreKikkeli: XD
[2023-08-26T20:12:36] KierreKikkeli: gonna take it to the xt60 actual professional guy tomorrow and try to learn wtf is wrong with me XD

[2023-08-26T20:29:04] Gabe Enzo: no formula for it
[2023-08-26T20:31:56] KierreKikkeli: Guess so

[2023-08-26T20:46:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: video stream was so laggy in 4G üò≠
[2023-08-26T20:47:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but 2 racers hit 150 km/h on this race üòÅ
[2023-08-26T20:47:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and one 153 km/h üòÅüòÅüòÅ
[2023-08-26T20:49:40] KierreKikkeli: what is i doing wrong
[2023-08-26T20:54:39] Gabe Enzo: what are you trying to do?
[2023-08-26T20:54:41] Gabe Enzo: desolder??
[2023-08-26T20:54:51] Gabe Enzo: Just Throw that stuff out it's done for
[2023-08-26T20:55:07] Gabe Enzo: how old is that tip?
[2023-08-26T20:55:24] KierreKikkeli: 1 day
[2023-08-26T20:55:38] KierreKikkeli: brand new equipment all
[2023-08-26T20:55:59] KierreKikkeli: i was just adding solder to the stray away strands
[2023-08-26T20:57:15] KierreKikkeli: no dice plugging it in the wall with the 12v 0.5A adapter? or ill just actually wait for tomorrow evening
[2023-08-26T22:01:31] Happy Giraffe: You just need enough to cover the metal surfaces. If thats 2cm naked wire then 4cm is enough
[2023-08-26T22:02:57] Happy Giraffe: Well you dont have 30v so gotta use something else than batteryüòÖ
[2023-08-26T22:03:14] Happy Giraffe: Charger is not a DC supply but could he use that?
[2023-08-26T22:03:42] Mirono escooters: What the
[2023-08-26T22:03:43] Mirono escooters: For what
[2023-08-26T22:03:55] Happy Giraffe: To just turn vesc on to test
[2023-08-26T22:04:01] Happy Giraffe: Withour motor
[2023-08-26T22:04:13] Mirono escooters: You need dc üíÄ And not 12v
[2023-08-26T22:04:14] Mirono escooters: More v
[2023-08-26T22:04:22] Mirono escooters: Why even bother without motor without battery Wat
[2023-08-26T22:04:41] Happy Giraffe: Just to see it doesn't explodeüòÇ Idk what he did to it haha
[2023-08-26T22:04:51] Mirono escooters: ;(
[2023-08-26T22:04:56] Mirono escooters: Will just kill more
[2023-08-26T22:05:03] Happy Giraffe: Idk id 12v is enough to turn it on
[2023-08-26T22:05:48] Happy Giraffe: @KierreKikkeli yes this is what you do then. Use charger to power vescüòÇ
[2023-08-26T22:05:56] Happy Giraffe: Some more soldering practice for youüòÇ
[2023-08-26T22:06:32] Happy Giraffe: Ofc he would have dc but charger not made to act like psu
[2023-08-26T22:18:31] KierreKikkeli: Like a usb c to the board or strip a usb and attach xt 60/90
[2023-08-26T22:21:57] Happy Giraffe: Wtf no usb c
[2023-08-26T22:22:04] Happy Giraffe: Your scooter battery charger
[2023-08-26T22:22:17] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-08-26T22:22:27] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-08-26T22:22:29] Basti: how can you connect a volt display with a key to the flipsky 75100 or what do i need for that
[2023-08-26T22:22:32] KierreKikkeli: The old one and how??? Xd
[2023-08-26T22:22:45] Happy Giraffe: Any within 10-16s
[2023-08-26T22:22:58] KierreKikkeli: Ait
[2023-08-26T22:23:05] KierreKikkeli: But how
[2023-08-26T22:23:21] Happy Giraffe: I have xt90 on my charger, maybe your external has xt30
[2023-08-26T22:23:37] KierreKikkeli: Its just a round head
[2023-08-26T22:23:47] KierreKikkeli: The stock like but 50v 2A
[2023-08-26T22:24:23] KierreKikkeli: Solder a charger connector to it or slap the charger port on the vesc
[2023-08-26T22:28:12] Happy Giraffe: If you have external battery with xt30 then I would make xt30 to charger. Then solder xt30 to original charge plug so you can choose between xt30/Xiaomi port
[2023-08-26T22:29:36] Happy Giraffe: So this way you can charge batt indepentently also if needed
[2023-08-26T22:33:11] KierreKikkeli: Sounds easier the other way around xd
[2023-08-26T22:34:10] Happy Giraffe: Its really easy like this
[2023-08-26T22:34:41] Happy Giraffe: Charger 2 cables > xt 30 male
[2023-08-26T22:35:06] Happy Giraffe: Then Xiaomi stock port cable > xt 30 female
[2023-08-26T22:35:13] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-08-26T22:46:13] KierreKikkeli: Ill ask for the tech guru tomorrow
[2023-08-26T22:46:21] KierreKikkeli: If he can do it
[2023-08-26T22:51:01] Happy Giraffe: Thats an easy job for sure
[2023-08-26T23:42:08] Simone: if you use a soldering iron that instead of the tip you have a chisel and 150w
[2023-08-26T23:42:16] Simone: especially beginners
[2023-08-26T23:42:25] Simone: you will always get a crap job
[2023-08-27T00:34:12] Happy Giraffe: Our finnish topguy of riding insane ebikes likes his Venom Total Top Custom here he flies 70kmh to groundüôà
[2023-08-27T01:03:47] Happy Giraffe: Old Bearebike , 25kw or so ebike
[2023-08-27T01:10:37] Finn: Rwd
[2023-08-27T01:10:43] Finn: Rear wheel has too much power
[2023-08-27T01:13:28] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: no
[2023-08-27T01:14:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: He is not even pressing the throttle when it gets worse.
[2023-08-27T01:17:34] Finn: Yes
[2023-08-27T01:17:46] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Makes no sense.
[2023-08-27T01:17:57] Finn: Its the same on my g30
[2023-08-27T01:17:59] Finn: With rwd
[2023-08-27T01:18:14] Finn: If you let off the gas it continues to wobble
[2023-08-27T01:18:23] Finn: Normal behavour
[2023-08-27T01:18:33] Finn: On g30?
[2023-08-27T01:18:46] Finn: No suspension
[2023-08-27T01:18:50] Finn: Stock motor
[2023-08-27T01:19:25] Finn: Yes
[2023-08-27T01:19:29] Finn: Bc rear wheel
[2023-08-27T01:19:35] Finn: How much you weight
[2023-08-27T01:19:56] Finn: Front wheel its common that it corrects itself
[2023-08-27T01:21:10] Finn: Prove me wrong
[2023-08-27T01:23:15] Happy Giraffe: But this rider isnt a noob, he had like ~30 ebikes and scooters so far that go 25-160kmh on roadüòÅ
[2023-08-27T01:23:26] Happy Giraffe: Interesting wobble indeed
[2023-08-27T01:23:32] Finn: Yeah
[2023-08-27T01:36:56] JPPL: Videos of today rideeeeee? üòçüòçüòç
[2023-08-27T01:44:52] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Looks like solar scooter
[2023-08-27T01:45:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: They have this huge ass Display with only the speed on it
[2023-08-27T03:47:42] Nick: Apparently the controller in this before did 35a and this thing somehow did 70kmh
[2023-08-27T03:48:27] Nick: Does that mean there's a higher peak amp number or is 35 not small? The ESC I bought does 200 and I'm assuming I'll get to use 100 of those before blowing shit up
[2023-08-27T04:10:07] Nick: Assuming 1 amp is like 1 horsepower I'd eventuallyike 1200 amp in my motor
[2023-08-27T04:10:19] Nick: Probably after numerous upgrades lol
[2023-08-27T05:23:33] Luis Magalhaes: Nice, what was the scooters? üòÅ
[2023-08-27T05:30:23] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Not so, Xiaomi better for no hand riding
[2023-08-27T09:13:52] koxx / Francois Deslandes: rapahel : nami frame, 153 km/h quentin : modified thunder frame, 150 km/h both with c350. the main issue now is battery (bms cut at 80¬∞ during the pratice) and motor temperature (ntc indicated 163¬∞C during the race)
[2023-08-27T09:32:15] Gabe Enzo: Correct
[2023-08-27T11:15:13] Happy Giraffe: Obarter D5
[2023-08-27T11:17:10] Happy Giraffe: What were esc temps on 3shul?
[2023-08-27T11:18:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: very low.
[2023-08-27T11:20:44] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_9454@27-08-2023_11-20-44.jpg>
[2023-08-27T11:36:06] Simone: can you show the pics of the cooler you're using now?
[2023-08-27T11:36:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: you'll have a to ask @Foujiwara
[2023-08-27T11:45:29] Happy Giraffe: I definitely want 3Shul for next vesc. Aint tolerating spintend QC. Even if its cheaper I think it aint sadly worth itü§î
[2023-08-27T12:16:58] Luis Magalhaes: Dam thats getting hot üòÅ both 20s too right?
[2023-08-27T12:19:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: 22S both
[2023-08-27T12:21:23] Luis Magalhaes: Oo thought they had 20S too, and parallel?
[2023-08-27T12:21:29] Luis Magalhaes: 10p?
[2023-08-27T12:22:20] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I don't remember. @SibClimb will tell you. but it's the final today ;)
[2023-08-27T12:23:38] Luis Magalhaes: üëå, @Foujiwara go get the first place üòÅüòú
[2023-08-27T12:25:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: already won all the previous races, so, at points count, unless is crash or have a serious escooter issue, it should be ok üòú
[2023-08-27T12:26:41] Luis Magalhaes: Great, hope he can run no with no problems üòÅ
[2023-08-27T12:36:58] JPPL: Amazinggggg! Amazing progress! Crazy top speed! On track!!‚ù§Ô∏è
[2023-08-27T12:38:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Motor magnets supports 120¬∞C , you fuck magnets with this temperature
[2023-08-27T12:39:45] Mirono escooters: üò≥
[2023-08-27T12:39:54] Mirono escooters: Batt 80* isn't fun either lol
[2023-08-27T12:39:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: it's the windings temperature, so, with the air gap, the stator dissipation and the vents, we expect it to hold.
[2023-08-27T12:40:05] Mirono escooters: Pot it with dielectric epoxy
[2023-08-27T12:40:11] koxx / Francois Deslandes: but yes, it's VERY HOT
[2023-08-27T12:40:18] Mirono escooters: Ferrofluid?
[2023-08-27T12:40:58] koxx / Francois Deslandes: with the vent holes, we had a look. the windings seems in good state (not dirty brown)
[2023-08-27T12:41:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: no (and vents holes)
[2023-08-27T12:41:31] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I was really surprised it didn't burn too üòÖ
[2023-08-27T12:42:06] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I think raphael will open & check them after returning to Lyon
[2023-08-27T12:42:12] koxx / Francois Deslandes: üòÖüòÖ
[2023-08-27T12:50:29] JPPL: Too much power, reaching the limits
[2023-08-27T13:05:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_9455@27-08-2023_13-05-25.jpg>
[2023-08-27T13:05:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahaha
[2023-08-27T13:05:37] koxx / Francois Deslandes: raph wins again üòúüôà
[2023-08-27T13:07:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: My question is how other scooters don‚Äôt die with stock configuration
[2023-08-27T13:19:26] Happy Giraffe: V8 engine powered fan to cool motor during pit stopüòÇ
[2023-08-27T13:19:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ü§£ü§£ü§£
[2023-08-27T13:21:42] Mirono escooters: Tbh yes, have a massive fan blowing
[2023-08-27T13:22:11] Mirono escooters: Can't you cnc motor casing so it pulls more air?
[2023-08-27T13:22:26] Mirono escooters: With fins
[2023-08-27T14:57:35] rosheee: ^^'
[2023-08-27T14:59:14] Luis Magalhaes: Water cooling like weeped üòú
[2023-08-27T15:01:41] Mirono escooters: How would you watercool a moving hubmotor?
[2023-08-27T15:05:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_9456@27-08-2023_15-05-15.jpg>
[2023-08-27T15:09:28] Gabe Enzo: that part moves tho???
[2023-08-27T15:09:32] Gabe Enzo: only the bolt doesn't
[2023-08-27T15:10:06] Gabe Enzo: Faster you go the more air cooling you get
[2023-08-27T15:10:27] Mirono escooters: Lol, and the way more heat you pump into it
[2023-08-27T15:10:42] Mirono escooters: Wrong
[2023-08-27T15:10:43] Gabe Enzo: The calculus curve turns it into a static line.
[2023-08-27T15:10:49] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-08-27T15:12:18] Gabe Enzo: Haha what. magnets are metal, do you mean the glue that holds them in the metallic mold?
[2023-08-27T15:12:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Why you try to explain that I do as job?
[2023-08-27T15:13:08] Gabe Enzo: I'm just curious what they're held by
[2023-08-27T15:13:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: Open computer, search it
[2023-08-27T15:13:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs easy
[2023-08-27T15:13:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: Magnet doesn‚Äôt melt, it lost magnetic field power
[2023-08-27T15:16:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: And also mercury is metal, and melt in your hand ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2023-08-27T15:19:06] Mirono escooters: Yep, demagnetization
[2023-08-27T15:19:12] Mirono escooters: Cheap motorS+ magnets even 80* rip
[2023-08-27T15:19:34] Luis Magalhaes: https://youtu.be/hGWxZ8vvJOw?si=Ef_VkUy-WG_VQGcl
[2023-08-27T15:22:02] Gabe Enzo: see this is what I'm scared of cause most motors that our community uses are all no name
[2023-08-27T15:22:17] Happy Giraffe: And no thermistorüòÅ
[2023-08-27T15:22:19] Gabe Enzo: Like who knows if you come across a shit one and spent 200 on it
[2023-08-27T15:22:22] Gabe Enzo: Yeap
[2023-08-27T15:23:44] Mirono escooters: Boring speed
[2023-08-27T15:23:56] Mirono escooters: Wepeds look like a kid designing üòÇ imo very ugly
[2023-08-27T15:23:58] Mirono escooters: But it's a style
[2023-08-27T15:24:25] Mirono escooters: Uhu 80* then
[2023-08-27T15:24:39] Mirono escooters: Buy new and from brands?..
[2023-08-27T15:25:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ly uses 38h , up to 120
[2023-08-27T15:25:55] Luis Magalhaes: Just to see the water cooling üòÇ
[2023-08-27T15:26:15] Gabe Enzo: Can't find brands tho. recommend me one?
[2023-08-27T15:26:21] Gabe Enzo: They're all no name Chinese crap when I look
[2023-08-27T15:32:17] Mirono escooters: Rage mechanics üò≥üò≥
[2023-08-27T15:54:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: I saw their box of magnets Xd, they pay over 10k‚Ç¨ per box hahaha
[2023-08-27T16:08:47] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_9457@27-08-2023_16-08-47.jpg>
[2023-08-27T16:08:48] Gabe Enzo: Is it high torque or speed motor
[2023-08-27T16:32:51] Mirono escooters: Wonder why they dont advertise it
[2023-08-27T16:37:58] Happy Giraffe: I had a crazy idea of ordering titanium bike/frame from chinaüòÇ they say customization is possible so might be able to beef it up. Would handle 20kw easy and never have fatique issues like aluminium
[2023-08-27T16:43:50] Mirono escooters: Steel frame ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2023-08-27T16:44:37] Happy Giraffe: Believe it or not steel frames are so expensive nowadays
[2023-08-27T16:58:13] Mirono escooters: Wha
[2023-08-27T16:58:18] Mirono escooters: Bomber frame ezpz
[2023-08-27T17:12:09] Mirono escooters: Cool, all my 6 vescs ordered on alieexpresss are waiting in Warehouse to get packed in 1 big Theyve been doing it for ages, it's so handy
[2023-08-27T17:12:27] Mirono escooters: Does add a day or 2 delay but oh well. Helps the 1‚Ç¨ packages like connectors not take months (worth it..)
[2023-08-27T17:12:46] Pablo Fernandez: Thats cool except when you have to wait for 1 item a month and they all get delayed
[2023-08-27T17:13:12] Mirono escooters: Never happens for me
[2023-08-27T17:13:16] Mirono escooters: Max 5 days
[2023-08-27T17:13:27] Mirono escooters: And the smol things like connectors, cables, blabla go fast
[2023-08-27T17:13:38] Mirono escooters: Otherwise the economy airline stuff is months

[2023-08-27T17:34:31] Happy Giraffe: Charging almost same as 3shul
[2023-08-27T17:34:54] Happy Giraffe: Bit cheaper if vat actually included
[2023-08-27T17:38:06] Mirono escooters: Technically is
[2023-08-27T17:38:14] Mirono escooters: Wottercooled tho
[2023-08-27T17:38:20] Mirono escooters: Itis
[2023-08-27T17:46:25] Happy Giraffe: You get 15kg frame that makes same job as a 3kg frame, stock titanium is 1.5 but if they reinforce it even moreüòÅ
[2023-08-27T17:47:05] Mirono escooters: You want weight, it helps stay on road and not fly with a hobble
[2023-08-27T17:47:10] Mirono escooters: I didn't mind my stealth bomber atall.
[2023-08-27T17:47:13] Mirono escooters: Way better feeling
[2023-08-27T17:49:02] Happy Giraffe: It will be agile and weight atleast 30-35kg anywaysüòÅ
[2023-08-27T17:49:14] Happy Giraffe: Plus Im riding 60kmh max

[2023-08-27T22:37:38] Happy Giraffe: Welcome bro!‚ù§Ô∏è
[2023-08-27T22:37:59] Happy Giraffe: Or enjoy your stay, if you were here before haha
[2023-08-27T22:38:42] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: Spam i think ‚Ä¶
[2023-08-27T22:39:38] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: I don‚Äôt know
[2023-08-27T22:40:02] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: I have sent a video with my zero 11x and at description I said that I want to sell it for ¬£4800
[2023-08-27T22:40:37] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: Yes, but now all good
[2023-08-27T22:40:38] Happy Giraffe: Idk who it was but feel free to post it again
[2023-08-27T22:40:51] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: Is ok‚Ä¶ üòÖ
[2023-08-27T22:51:30] EtorroS Best E-Scooter Repair Specialist: Thank you! ‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è
[2023-08-28T07:23:39] Cass: At my roads to work 70 kmh limit but cars push you down under 85 so 90 is the safe
[2023-08-28T13:25:25] Mihail: Going high speed avoids cars and saves me more than 5 minutes off my 6km commute to work. Feels a lot safer, too
[2023-08-28T13:27:27] Mihail: I stopped using bike lanes since they are often filled with moms pushing strollers, since the infrastructure in my city is horrible and the pedestrian zones are uneven, or don't exist
[2023-08-28T13:33:54] Mirono escooters: Car roads always so good smooth Bike and pedestrian, totally fucked
[2023-08-28T13:50:39] Gabe Enzo: bruh I fucking know right.
[2023-08-28T13:50:47] Gabe Enzo: Yeah or dumb humans walking on bike lanes
[2023-08-28T13:51:18] Gabe Enzo: High speeds are genuinely safer, as u merge with traffic instead of impeding it and confusing drivers.
[2023-08-28T13:51:40] Gabe Enzo: <sticker>
[2023-08-28T13:52:07] Gabe Enzo: but you need a good indicator system üëÄ
[2023-08-28T14:08:48] Happy Giraffe: Problem with electric vehicles is they are fast and make no sound. 125cc motorbike will be heard
[2023-08-28T14:37:41] Gabe Enzo: Yeah alot of people whine about Tesla's for the same reason. Apparently they are too brain-dead to look both ways when crossing üö∏
[2023-08-28T14:38:01] Gabe Enzo: Sound shouldn't be your main sense when LOOKING for vehicles that could kill you
[2023-08-28T14:43:07] Mihail: I've seen idiots in both cars and e-scooters. But they are way more dangerous in cars.
[2023-08-28T14:58:18] Happy Giraffe: Nobody looks anyways even for bike lane. People talk phone etc use snapchat
[2023-08-28T15:01:31] AK: Man can you stop offtopic for half a day
[2023-08-28T15:16:05] Gabe Enzo: You two* But okay, I'm done you're right, it's not my chat.
[2023-08-28T16:23:51] Mirono escooters: No??
[2023-08-28T16:25:20] Happy Giraffe: Hmm
[2023-08-28T16:25:41] Happy Giraffe: Also the phase wires seem thin
[2023-08-28T16:25:46] Mirono escooters: What makes you think
[2023-08-28T16:25:51] Mirono escooters: Thats normal
[2023-08-28T16:26:28] Mirono escooters: Can't fit more through axle, ssh
[2023-08-28T16:26:41] Happy Giraffe: Lol, my 800w rated motor has same diameter
[2023-08-28T16:26:44] Mirono escooters: Its plenty
[2023-08-28T16:26:48] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-08-28T16:27:45] Happy Giraffe: Case closed it was used motor and previous owner a retard
[2023-08-29T08:33:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: some nice pictures from the race !
[2023-08-29T08:33:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_9470@29-08-2023_08-33-30.jpg>
[2023-08-29T08:34:11] Mirono escooters: Almost ai üò≥
[2023-08-29T08:36:38] koxx / Francois Deslandes: <photos/photo_9471@29-08-2023_08-36-38.jpg>
[2023-08-29T08:36:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nice angle üòÅ
[2023-08-29T08:37:02] Mirono escooters: Thats some trust in those tires
[2023-08-29T08:37:06] Mirono escooters: I could never
[2023-08-29T08:37:18] Mirono escooters: Isn't that brake like mm from the ground
[2023-08-29T08:37:26] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahahah, yes
[2023-08-29T09:33:42] Eric Howat: On the ubox v2 x2 j do I have to run the ADC for a throttle or can I wire direct and will VESC know I‚Äôm trying to control both motors from just the one port?
[2023-08-29T09:35:16] Eric Howat: Same with throttle for regen braking taking VESC tool will know what I‚Äôm doing running it to port ADC1 for throttle and ADC2 for regen?
[2023-08-29T12:43:13] Gabe Enzo: You can tell he's lucky
[2023-08-29T12:43:37] Mirono escooters: Pro
[2023-08-29T12:43:47] Face de Pin Suc√©: No he's not, he knows what's he doing
[2023-08-29T12:44:16] Face de Pin Suc√©: He touched the brake disc many times the ground, but not more than needed and not enough to fall ;)
[2023-08-29T12:48:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Heh
[2023-08-29T12:48:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: <photos/photo_9473@29-08-2023_12-48-07.jpg>
[2023-08-29T12:52:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: You guys training ? üòÅ
[2023-08-29T12:52:18] Pablo Fernandez: the guy behind you has balls of steel, if he falls rip arms
[2023-08-29T12:53:13] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Unfortunately, we do not have regulations for such competitions and everyone drives as they want, it's very sad
[2023-08-29T12:54:24] Face de Pin Suc√©: Anyway
[2023-08-29T12:54:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: <photos/photo_9474@29-08-2023_12-54-25.jpg>
[2023-08-29T12:54:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: 153Kmh on track, 152 GPS hehe
[2023-08-29T12:54:41] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: it was an "e-scooter/e-bike competition" on August 6th at an average kart track
[2023-08-29T12:54:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: Oh nice, did you win ?
[2023-08-29T12:55:25] Gabe Enzo: 30000kw to get to 150kmh huh
[2023-08-29T12:56:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: if we look at VESC RT data, it says 33KW, but we believe our measurement is more accurate
[2023-08-29T12:56:50] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: We win the fastest lap time, but because no rules and no regulations at all our team was not seek the target to make 1st place. Because we ride with something like this
[2023-08-29T12:56:53] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: <photos/photo_9475@29-08-2023_12-56-53.jpg>
[2023-08-29T12:57:01] Gabe Enzo: What battery specs do you have on it?,
[2023-08-29T12:57:09] Gabe Enzo: 20s20p? or what
[2023-08-29T12:57:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: WTF hahahaha
[2023-08-29T12:57:20] Gabe Enzo: 30 min of sustained high speed is insane
[2023-08-29T12:57:23] Gabe Enzo: lots of kwh
[2023-08-29T12:57:24] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, exactly wtf
[2023-08-29T12:57:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: 99Kmh average speed measured by the track circuit themselves
[2023-08-29T12:57:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: 24Km
[2023-08-29T12:58:19] Face de Pin Suc√©: but in 2 races with 10mins stop between, so ride does'nt last 34min hehe
[2023-08-29T12:58:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: 22S10P
[2023-08-29T12:59:23] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Its only accelerating. To ride 150kmh dont need that. Atleast ~27kw continious
[2023-08-29T13:00:41] Face de Pin Suc√©: Here, on this corner, we are pushing 124Kmh with 45¬∞ lean angle
[2023-08-29T13:01:19] Face de Pin Suc√©: <photos/photo_9476@29-08-2023_13-01-19.jpg>
[2023-08-29T13:01:28] Gabe Enzo: what's the actual top speed btw? with the 30kw scooter
[2023-08-29T13:01:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: Sorry picture was croped
[2023-08-29T13:01:46] Face de Pin Suc√©: 153 on the track
[2023-08-29T13:01:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: our second race scooter did 150
[2023-08-29T13:13:37] Nick: I'd be happy with my PEV doing at least 100kmh max at least until I can get it plated somehow
[2023-08-29T13:13:52] Nick: And then all bets are off and I'll only drive in "Mexico"
[2023-08-29T14:21:43] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: @SibClimb that was our "competitor"
[2023-08-29T14:21:43] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: <photos/photo_9477@29-08-2023_14-21-43.jpg>
[2023-08-29T14:21:59] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I have no comments about what we have here
[2023-08-29T14:22:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: Laotie the first please noüò≠
[2023-08-29T14:22:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: How these motors don‚Äôt melt
[2023-08-29T14:23:06] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Its full custom
[2023-08-29T14:23:14] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: All scooter is custom
[2023-08-29T14:23:34] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But it cant handle turns at all
[2023-08-29T14:24:05] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Trail and geometry fcked up
[2023-08-29T14:25:00] Pablo Fernandez: <photos/photo_9478@29-08-2023_14-25-00.jpg>
[2023-08-29T14:25:04] Pablo Fernandez: Even the color holy fuck
[2023-08-29T14:29:37] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, thats right
[2023-08-29T14:45:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: Hahahahaha I'm dead
[2023-08-29T15:18:24] Happy Giraffe: +1cm moment
[2023-08-29T15:29:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: ?
[2023-08-29T15:31:21] JPPL: Seems a solid build, not for my taste, also personally (who gives a fuck), there is no % of sense on this projects with seat. Otherwise the 1st choice would never be this escooter frames
[2023-08-29T15:36:32] Oreo huzky: Is this ant bms because seller listed as ant bms looks exactly the same but dosent have the normal ant bms sticker on it
[2023-08-29T15:42:33] Mirono escooters: Problably
[2023-08-29T15:45:03] Oreo huzky: Oof
[2023-08-29T15:51:18] Jan: He meant pp growth
[2023-08-29T15:51:25] Jan: üòÇ
[2023-08-29T15:52:41] Happy Giraffe: Weid way of saying its insaneüòÇ
[2023-08-29T15:54:29] Face de Pin Suc√©: Hahahaha
[2023-08-29T19:16:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: It shouldn‚Äôt worth, ant is already very cheap
[2023-08-29T19:20:03] Oreo huzky: It had same price as ant
[2023-08-29T19:26:49] Eric Howat: Does anyone have a spec sheet for the sincwave 52v18.2 ah battery? (Yes I know it cheap junk lol) looking for BMS output draw and peak
[2023-08-29T19:29:52] Mirono escooters: Problably doesn't exist
[2023-08-29T19:29:57] Mirono escooters: Just get a proper batt xD
[2023-08-29T19:30:03] Eric Howat: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-08-29T19:30:12] Eric Howat: I know I don‚Äôt have time to build one till winter
[2023-08-29T19:30:30] Eric Howat: Guess I‚Äôll find out when I draw more then the BMS will allow üòÇ
[2023-08-29T19:30:49] Eric Howat: Assuming it‚Äôs around 50amps
[2023-08-29T19:31:57] Oreo huzky: I thought it was real ant bms
[2023-08-29T19:32:05] Oreo huzky: The listing said ant bms
[2023-08-29T19:57:01] KierreKikkeli: does the spintend adc v2 need a 12v power connector aswell as comm connector?
[2023-08-29T19:57:36] KierreKikkeli: as in slap it in there with the ubox alu 80v 100A
[2023-08-29T19:58:13] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9482@29-08-2023_19-58-13.jpg>
[2023-08-29T19:59:40] KierreKikkeli: Also what are these ports for? The spintend manual barely has any info if at all
[2023-08-29T20:24:53] KierreKikkeli: alrit
[2023-08-29T20:25:10] KierreKikkeli: Thanks
[2023-08-29T20:25:42] KierreKikkeli: Also which motor cable to which connector?
[2023-08-29T20:34:51] Mirono escooters: Any
[2023-08-29T20:35:13] Mirono escooters: Official shop time
[2023-08-29T20:35:24] KierreKikkeli: Really? So doesnt matter which phase goes where?
[2023-08-29T20:35:42] KierreKikkeli: Ait
[2023-08-29T20:35:48] KierreKikkeli: Guess its testing time then
[2023-08-29T20:35:57] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9485@29-08-2023_20-35-57.jpg>
[2023-08-29T20:36:05] KierreKikkeli: Or config first
[2023-08-29T20:36:33] Eric Howat: I‚Äôm surprised so many people use the ADC
[2023-08-29T20:36:57] Eric Howat: I guess it‚Äôs nice if your switching things frequently
[2023-08-29T20:37:37] KierreKikkeli: Yeah thats my reason
[2023-08-29T20:37:53] KierreKikkeli: all of the abover
[2023-08-29T20:37:56] Eric Howat: What‚Äôs the benefit to running at 5v over 3?
[2023-08-29T20:38:05] KierreKikkeli: stock throttle is at 5v
[2023-08-29T20:38:15] Eric Howat: Gotcha that makes sense
[2023-08-29T20:38:18] Mirono escooters: A lil more throttle range
[2023-08-29T20:38:25] Mirono escooters: For 5v throttle sensors ofc
[2023-08-29T20:38:41] KierreKikkeli: also i need it incase of popo stops me and tells me to go register it as a moped
[2023-08-29T20:39:02] KierreKikkeli: then i have an easy way of just slapping signals in and to go get plates for it
[2023-08-29T20:39:13] Eric Howat: Makes sense. I‚Äôm looking for durability so I don‚Äôt need more shit to mount down lol I‚Äôm just going straight to the VESC for throttle and regen with 2x 270s
[2023-08-29T20:39:40] KierreKikkeli: ah yeah, i need to drive on the main road here myself so turn signals and brake signal is kind of a must have XD
[2023-08-29T20:39:44] Eric Howat: Yeah here in Michigan cops give 0 fucks about scooters they fall under the legality of an electric skateboard üòÇ
[2023-08-29T20:39:57] Eric Howat: No reg required and just brake lights
[2023-08-29T20:40:02] KierreKikkeli: here anything going over 25kmh must be registered as a moped
[2023-08-29T20:40:29] Eric Howat: We are limited to 25mph max here but my brothers a local sheriff so it‚Äôs not a concern lol
[2023-08-29T20:40:32] KierreKikkeli: and mopeds have the normal requirements for basic shit like lights, signals and horn
[2023-08-29T20:41:40] Eric Howat: True, guess there‚Äôs really no other way to protect the input as anything inline would probably disrupt the resolution
[2023-08-29T20:42:35] Eric Howat: Exactly. I think on the V2 J you still have a port on the VESC for brake lights
[2023-08-29T20:43:24] KierreKikkeli: naah not on mine atleast
[2023-08-29T20:43:28] Eric Howat: <photos/photo_9486@29-08-2023_20-43-28.jpg>
[2023-08-29T20:43:47] KierreKikkeli: or i could indeed install it into a 12v or a 5v fan port
[2023-08-29T20:43:47] Eric Howat: I‚Äôm not sure what that 12v ports for maybe it‚Äôs just on/off power
[2023-08-29T20:43:50] KierreKikkeli: but then its always on
[2023-08-29T20:44:12] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9487@29-08-2023_20-44-12.jpg>
[2023-08-29T20:44:28] KierreKikkeli: as far as im aware its either perma on or off
[2023-08-29T20:44:31] KierreKikkeli: hence adc
[2023-08-29T20:44:42] Eric Howat: I‚Äôll post back once I find out. Like I said I‚Äôm not super worried. This is a trail scooter more or less so it‚Äôs not a requirement
[2023-08-29T20:45:08] Eric Howat: <photos/photo_9488@29-08-2023_20-45-08.jpg>
[2023-08-29T20:45:35] Eric Howat: It‚Äôs gonna see a lot of abuse so the ADC is more of a liability as I‚Äôm not sure how I‚Äôd keep it mounted safely
[2023-08-29T20:45:59] KierreKikkeli: stuff it in the pole -happy who uses adc v1
[2023-08-29T20:46:18] Eric Howat: Haha until I snap the pole off üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-08-29T20:46:31] KierreKikkeli: i mean, if its in the base all good
[2023-08-29T20:46:35] KierreKikkeli: XD
[2023-08-29T20:47:09] KierreKikkeli: rip wires tho, but the screw in ports look like they can handle a beating
[2023-08-29T20:47:13] Eric Howat: I may down the road grab one but for now, if Spintend wasn‚Äôt playing games with shipping maybe I‚Äôd order one but they don‚Äôt know wth is going on with my order
[2023-08-29T20:47:36] Eric Howat: Been shipping back and forth in Cali for 10 days üòÇ
[2023-08-29T20:47:49] KierreKikkeli: yeah had mine waiting in customs for 2 weeks coz no one informed i needed to pay the customs
[2023-08-29T20:48:15] Eric Howat: Mine looks like it made it through customers but it‚Äôs traveled 400 miles one way and back to another city in Cali
[2023-08-29T20:48:15] KierreKikkeli: and had to self inform about a shipping they have and already now the import fee for, for what ever reason
[2023-08-29T20:48:32] Eric Howat: <photos/photo_9489@29-08-2023_20-48-32.jpg>
[2023-08-29T20:48:37] KierreKikkeli: yeah mine went back and forth north and south finland about 5 times
[2023-08-29T20:48:41] KierreKikkeli: -fedex
[2023-08-29T20:49:01] Eric Howat: Yeah I‚Äôve never seen this before lol they do have good customer service tho very responsive so I‚Äôll give it time
[2023-08-29T20:49:09] KierreKikkeli: mine didnt XD
[2023-08-29T20:49:27] KierreKikkeli: they didnt even know wtf they were talking about XDDDDDDD
[2023-08-29T20:49:34] KierreKikkeli: after having to spam the robot for 15mins
[2023-08-29T20:49:39] KierreKikkeli: that is
[2023-08-29T20:49:48] Eric Howat: Lol I emailed them and they get back with me in a half hour tops
[2023-08-29T20:50:08] Eric Howat: Now do I think they know what they are saying, probably not lol but it‚Äôs the effort that counts I guess
[2023-08-29T20:50:30] KierreKikkeli: yeah i just call to get asap answers and they get intimidated from my "business/law school" communication/voice, makes life easy
[2023-08-29T20:50:39] KierreKikkeli: spam callers hang up within seconds aswell
[2023-08-29T20:50:40] KierreKikkeli: XD
[2023-08-29T20:51:20] Eric Howat: Oh man I love spam calls. I don‚Äôt get anymore sadly because I‚Äôd lead them on for along ass time then use swear words in their languages out of the blue and they would loose it
[2023-08-29T20:52:03] KierreKikkeli: i just intidate em with no/no not now/not intrested and they get confused and blacklist me XDDDDDD
[2023-08-29T20:52:31] KierreKikkeli: useful class/training when i went to school
[2023-08-29T20:52:36] Eric Howat: I love the car warranty calls. I always tell them I own a car that‚Äôs not legal here in the US and they get confused
[2023-08-29T20:52:47] KierreKikkeli: XD
[2023-08-29T20:52:47] Mirono escooters: Good one
[2023-08-29T20:53:13] KierreKikkeli: they never call me, ive had 3 vechicle insurances and a few apt ones, not a single call
[2023-08-29T20:53:17] Eric Howat: Actually miss those calls thinking about it. Made the day at work go by faster haha
[2023-08-29T20:53:25] KierreKikkeli: this
[2023-08-29T20:53:54] Eric Howat: Back to VESC questions, I‚Äôm assuming running 5.2 firmware is the way to go?
[2023-08-29T20:54:22] KierreKikkeli: i used to bulli em when they called my friends and was constantly asking about wool socks and if they sell em or when do i get em (we made a prop company in school where i was basically a slave driver ceo for wool sock manufacturing)
[2023-08-29T20:55:05] Eric Howat: Okay I think it‚Äôs 6.0
[2023-08-29T20:55:10] Eric Howat: I have to check
[2023-08-29T20:55:16] Eric Howat: Okay cool
[2023-08-29T20:55:25] KierreKikkeli: 6.0 is old apparently -vsc tool but its the latest for spintend
[2023-08-29T20:55:46] Eric Howat: I believe it is shipped with 6.0 now I think about it. Any benefit to going 6.02?
[2023-08-29T20:55:57] KierreKikkeli: i cant XD tells me no updates
[2023-08-29T20:57:44] Eric Howat: Gotcha makes sense
[2023-08-29T21:11:40] KierreKikkeli: oh well seems like happy is afk and im trying to config the vesc tool
[2023-08-29T21:11:57] KierreKikkeli: which type is the vsett10+ 60v 1400w?
[2023-08-29T21:12:30] SirGeoff: Large outrunner
[2023-08-29T21:13:33] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9491@29-08-2023_21-13-33.jpg>
[2023-08-29T21:13:56] SirGeoff: YES
[2023-08-29T21:14:32] SirGeoff: Override the default power and set 1400W
[2023-08-29T21:15:42] KierreKikkeli: assuming these?
[2023-08-29T21:17:36] KierreKikkeli: oh also assuming the usage panel is generic?
[2023-08-29T21:19:36] KierreKikkeli: imma try to power it with a 12s 44v 20A bms XD
[2023-08-29T21:19:38] SirGeoff: Yes. 1400W, 30 poles.
[2023-08-29T21:19:47] KierreKikkeli: with a single motor
[2023-08-29T21:19:50] SirGeoff: Generic
[2023-08-29T21:20:15] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9494@29-08-2023_21-20-15.jpg>
[2023-08-29T21:20:18] SirGeoff: Set battery amp to 20A, recuperation to -10A
[2023-08-29T21:20:48] KierreKikkeli: uhhhh xd
[2023-08-29T21:21:44] SirGeoff: Li-ion if you have this type of battery. 12S, capacity doesn't matter. It counts only to batt remaining display.
[2023-08-29T21:21:52] Mirono escooters: Doesn't even matter except for %
[2023-08-29T21:21:58] SirGeoff: batt regen -10A
[2023-08-29T21:22:02] SirGeoff: batt max 20A
[2023-08-29T21:23:19] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9496@29-08-2023_21-23-19.jpg>
[2023-08-29T21:23:37] SirGeoff: Direct drive - check it
[2023-08-29T21:23:44] KierreKikkeli: used these for batt
[2023-08-29T21:23:51] KierreKikkeli: ait
[2023-08-29T21:23:59] SirGeoff: wheel diameter: 250 will do, it only counts to speed calculation.
[2023-08-29T21:24:14] SirGeoff: OK
[2023-08-29T21:24:48] KierreKikkeli: alrit
[2023-08-29T21:24:59] KierreKikkeli: poles?
[2023-08-29T21:25:04] SirGeoff: 30
[2023-08-29T21:25:18] KierreKikkeli: and run detection?
[2023-08-29T21:25:26] SirGeoff: it means 15-15 nort and south poles. At least xiaomi motors has 30.
[2023-08-29T21:25:35] SirGeoff: yes, run detection
[2023-08-29T21:27:33] KierreKikkeli: vsett should apparently have less poles
[2023-08-29T21:27:36] KierreKikkeli: but thicker
[2023-08-29T21:28:02] SirGeoff: poles also counts to speed calculation.
[2023-08-29T21:28:18] KierreKikkeli: ah
[2023-08-29T21:28:25] KierreKikkeli: so no matter then even if wrong?
[2023-08-29T21:28:34] SirGeoff: you are right
[2023-08-29T21:29:11] SirGeoff: vesc use erpm, the number electromagnetic poles changes.
[2023-08-29T21:29:30] SirGeoff: Speed is calculated from erpm.
[2023-08-29T21:29:55] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9498@29-08-2023_21-29-55.jpg>
[2023-08-29T21:30:12] SirGeoff: Great. You have a working configuration.
[2023-08-29T21:31:14] KierreKikkeli: so i slap fwd on it as its on the front, it might be running backwards tho for the wires and brake disc
[2023-08-29T21:31:17] SirGeoff: I think your vesc is maxed out, because the 135.00A motor current.
[2023-08-29T21:31:35] KierreKikkeli: its 80v 100A
[2023-08-29T21:31:38] KierreKikkeli: ubox
[2023-08-29T21:31:41] SirGeoff: if you need, invert it.
[2023-08-29T21:32:01] SirGeoff: Yes, its maxed out üòÅ
[2023-08-29T21:32:32] KierreKikkeli: i mean, at best its running with that 12s and in the future with a 14s 60A
[2023-08-29T21:33:11] KierreKikkeli: seems like its spinning in the right direction, so the tyre is just installed wrong way by seller XD
[2023-08-29T21:35:09] SirGeoff: Super. Enjoy it. You have a basic configuration, make a backup from it.
[2023-08-29T21:35:14] KierreKikkeli: is it now like drive ready? no need to config anything else?
[2023-08-29T21:35:19] Mirono escooters: 135? Xd
[2023-08-29T21:35:43] KierreKikkeli: how xd
[2023-08-29T21:36:39] KierreKikkeli: thats bad?
[2023-08-29T21:36:44] SirGeoff: It may be ready you can try it, but there is a chance you need to fine tune the sensored-sensorless switching erpm number, or the observer type.
[2023-08-29T21:37:03] SirGeoff: No, just your motor is capable more.
[2023-08-29T21:37:19] KierreKikkeli: ah yeah that im aware of, only need to go max 50kmh
[2023-08-29T21:37:40] KierreKikkeli: and the stock speed is between 75 and 100kmh
[2023-08-29T21:37:45] Mirono escooters: Usually my vescs always report 35-70
[2023-08-29T21:37:49] Mirono escooters: Even the biggest qs273
[2023-08-29T21:38:16] KierreKikkeli: what how? im a complete beginner
[2023-08-29T21:38:28] KierreKikkeli: also how do i backup?
[2023-08-29T21:39:34] SirGeoff: vesc tool can do it.
[2023-08-29T21:40:04] KierreKikkeli: this or confbackup
[2023-08-29T21:41:33] SirGeoff: Save motor configuration to xml
[2023-08-29T21:43:22] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9501@29-08-2023_21-43-22.jpg>
[2023-08-29T21:43:51] KierreKikkeli: which mebf
[2023-08-29T21:46:01] Oreo huzky: I‚Äôve looked at pcb and looks exactly the same some minor parts difference and it also uses ant bms app
[2023-08-29T21:46:21] KierreKikkeli: uhhh xd, i have spintend adc 2 and 5v throttle
[2023-08-29T21:47:50] KierreKikkeli: i has adc
[2023-08-29T21:48:12] KierreKikkeli: setup input
[2023-08-29T21:48:29] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9504@29-08-2023_21-48-29.jpg>
[2023-08-29T21:50:11] Eric Howat: You can run a 5v throttle without the ADC v2 right ? It‚Äôll just only respond to 3.3v?
[2023-08-29T21:50:16] KierreKikkeli: i max end voltage at 3.3 so guess ill leave it at 3
[2023-08-29T21:50:34] KierreKikkeli: no clue no connector, throttle already in adc v2
[2023-08-29T21:51:03] Eric Howat: That‚Äôs what I thought it‚Äôs strange with the ADC it‚Äôs only showing 3v
[2023-08-29T21:51:17] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9506@29-08-2023_21-51-17.jpg>
[2023-08-29T21:53:29] KierreKikkeli: left it at stock settings
[2023-08-29T21:53:34] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9507@29-08-2023_21-53-34.jpg>
[2023-08-29T21:53:41] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9508@29-08-2023_21-53-41.jpg>
[2023-08-29T21:53:49] KierreKikkeli: did nothing
[2023-08-29T21:54:20] KierreKikkeli: full voltage as in all of em?
[2023-08-29T21:54:25] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9509@29-08-2023_21-54-25.jpg>
[2023-08-29T21:55:09] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9510@29-08-2023_21-55-09.jpg>
[2023-08-29T21:55:22] KierreKikkeli: 1.07v ??????????
[2023-08-29T21:55:25] KierreKikkeli: tf
[2023-08-29T21:55:29] Eric Howat: Doesn‚Äôt it look like it‚Äôs connected to 3v since it‚Äôs showing under adc1
[2023-08-29T21:55:47] KierreKikkeli: pressed apply
[2023-08-29T21:55:54] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9511@29-08-2023_21-55-54.jpg>
[2023-08-29T21:56:05] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9512@29-08-2023_21-56-05.jpg>
[2023-08-29T21:56:10] KierreKikkeli: yes
[2023-08-29T21:56:18] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9513@29-08-2023_21-56-18.jpg>
[2023-08-29T21:56:25] KierreKikkeli: thank you for holding my hand through this guys XD
[2023-08-29T21:57:10] KierreKikkeli: ubrake? as in electric brake sensor in the brake handle?
[2023-08-29T21:57:41] KierreKikkeli: sure so i can slow down faster and easier
[2023-08-29T21:58:15] KierreKikkeli: yeah brakes not connected, only throttle to see if the thing/config works
[2023-08-29T21:58:36] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9514@29-08-2023_21-58-36.jpg>
[2023-08-29T21:58:53] KierreKikkeli: then this?
[2023-08-29T21:59:21] KierreKikkeli: aight, so just try it out now
[2023-08-29T21:59:55] KierreKikkeli: *
[2023-08-29T22:00:42] KierreKikkeli: ait
[2023-08-29T22:00:48] puneDir: whats the 75100 max currents
[2023-08-29T22:01:39] KierreKikkeli: ait it works
[2023-08-29T22:01:47] KierreKikkeli: these ones not so much
[2023-08-29T22:02:06] KierreKikkeli: ah
[2023-08-29T22:03:35] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9518@29-08-2023_22-03-35.jpg>
[2023-08-29T22:03:40] KierreKikkeli: there we gi
[2023-08-29T22:03:41] KierreKikkeli: go
[2023-08-29T22:07:49] KierreKikkeli: guess ill now just need to extend all the wires for head light, brake sensor and throttle :))
[2023-08-29T22:56:42] Finn: Hey how much would arround 20cm of phase wire make when i calibrate the motor amps
[2023-08-29T23:13:54] Happy Giraffe: Resistance or?
[2023-08-29T23:14:03] Finn: Yes
[2023-08-29T23:14:12] Happy Giraffe: Depends on cross section
[2023-08-29T23:14:42] Finn: Friend wont believe me the that it makes a difference for xiaomi controller to sit in the front rather then in the back
[2023-08-29T23:15:06] Happy Giraffe: But they are all included there anyways when we calibrate so doesnt matter that much. It will always be there
[2023-08-29T23:15:27] Happy Giraffe: Sure it does make a difference especially those thin wires
[2023-08-29T23:15:43] Happy Giraffe: But don't think it's gonna be a problem (like the stock phase connectors are)
[2023-08-29T23:16:44] Mirono escooters: Depends how big the wires are
[2023-08-29T23:16:47] Mirono escooters: But it's not that much
[2023-08-29T23:17:02] Finn: Xiaomi stock motor
[2023-08-29T23:17:28] Finn: I mean on vesc every cm makes a difference
[2023-08-29T23:17:31] Happy Giraffe: Then thered people running insane phase amps through them , big oof
[2023-08-29T23:17:49] Finn: Arroune 2-3kw
[2023-08-29T23:17:55] Happy Giraffe: Yeah its laws of physics
[2023-08-29T23:17:56] Finn: Through 300w
[2023-08-29T23:18:03] Happy Giraffe: Pls noüòÇ
[2023-08-29T23:18:08] Finn: Yeah
[2023-08-29T23:18:13] Finn: Friend killed his
[2023-08-29T23:18:22] Finn: <photos/photo_9519@29-08-2023_23-18-22.jpg>
[2023-08-29T23:18:23] Finn: <photos/photo_9520@29-08-2023_23-18-23.jpg>
[2023-08-29T23:18:39] Pablo Fernandez: peanut butter?
[2023-08-29T23:18:44] Finn: Yes
[2023-08-29T23:18:48] Finn: With bread
[2023-08-29T23:19:29] Happy Giraffe: Install baguette.exe
[2023-08-29T23:21:55] Finn: Wasnt that smth with bemf
[2023-08-29T23:25:38] Happy Giraffe: Vesc tool says hall interpolation, sensorless erpm etc saturation compensation or observer I guess
[2023-08-29T23:35:36] KierreKikkeli: Oh cool a neighbouring city had just a week long e scooter raid/check for modded e scoots xddd fml
[2023-08-29T23:36:24] KierreKikkeli: Yeah just need to learn how to
[2023-08-30T00:05:53] Happy Giraffe: Saved me once already...civil cop...portable dyno...üòÖ
[2023-08-30T00:07:14] puneDir: nice we dont have regulations in here
[2023-08-30T00:08:27] Eric Howat: Question, if not using the ADC board, why would you not be able to have a full range of a 5v throttle like a 270x? Anyone know why the ADC allows for 5v?
[2023-08-30T00:11:20] Happy Giraffe: Vescs send 3.3v so throttle can't magically have 5v
[2023-08-30T00:11:48] Happy Giraffe: Atleast my Spintend does
[2023-08-30T00:12:31] Eric Howat: So I get that it‚Äôll be limited to the 3.3v range even being a 5v throttle but how come the ADC v2 magically makes the 5v throttle full range to 5v?
[2023-08-30T00:13:06] Happy Giraffe: I guess throttles have some components inside that are designed for set V. Maybe someone who knows can give input?üòÅ im just guessing here
[2023-08-30T00:13:46] Happy Giraffe: It's from the uart cable thingy that has 5v
[2023-08-30T00:13:49] Eric Howat: Haha no your good, I‚Äôm really digging T it. Tbh I don‚Äôt care about the couple extra volt range I‚Äôll survive with 3.3v but im just curious if someone knows
[2023-08-30T00:14:41] Eric Howat: That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm wondering how it‚Äôs using all 5vs just because that thing is used and when not you can‚Äôt provide the full 5vs
[2023-08-30T00:16:44] Happy Giraffe: I think the ADC adapter actually converts it to 3 before sending it back to vescüòÇ
[2023-08-30T00:17:02] Mirono escooters: Uhu
[2023-08-30T00:17:19] Mirono escooters: Your ADC doesnt like over 3.3v
[2023-08-30T00:17:26] Happy Giraffe: @koxx3 We need brain reinforcements. We trying to exactly think how using ADC differs from vanillaüòÅ
[2023-08-30T00:17:53] Happy Giraffe: Yeah what a plug and play solution Mr VedderüòÇ
[2023-08-30T00:17:53] Mirono escooters: Of your stm chip
[2023-08-30T00:17:57] Mirono escooters: It is
[2023-08-30T00:18:12] Mirono escooters: It's basic and simple Vesc builders are free to implement a voltage divider Kuch mp2 did kuch
[2023-08-30T00:18:13] Happy Giraffe: Atleast for my torque sensorüòÅ
[2023-08-30T00:18:18] Mirono escooters: Problably 3shul did
[2023-08-30T00:18:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: on which vesc ?
[2023-08-30T00:18:49] Happy Giraffe: Generally, but on Spintend in example where you cant use native 5v throttle
[2023-08-30T00:19:09] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, on c350, 3shul included a voltage divider for adc
[2023-08-30T00:19:22] Mirono escooters: As they should
[2023-08-30T00:19:59] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes, it seems a good idea. just has to be clearly said in the manual üòâ
[2023-08-30T00:20:02] Happy Giraffe: Aah, finally can ditch adc boardüòÇ
[2023-08-30T00:20:17] Mirono escooters: ADC board is a stupid solution for a simple problem
[2023-08-30T00:20:23] Mirono escooters: Yet another thing in between to fail
[2023-08-30T00:20:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: don't tell me you used an adc board just for 2 resistors üòÅ
[2023-08-30T00:20:51] Happy Giraffe: Thats true, why my one is glued permanent to 5v
[2023-08-30T00:21:14] Happy Giraffe: I have the OG oneüòÇ
[2023-08-30T00:21:47] Happy Giraffe: I want to have throttle and ebrake separate and niceüòÇ
[2023-08-30T00:22:30] Eric Howat: I figured the ADC was converting back to 3.3 üòÇ
[2023-08-30T00:28:14] Eric Howat: Haha I figured I wasn‚Äôt planning on trying that üòÇüòÇ
[2023-08-30T00:29:19] Eric Howat: I‚Äôll live with adc1 and adc2 both running 270xs at 3.3v for throttle and regen no big deal. Sounds like a sales tactic saying it‚Äôs ‚Äú5v throttle capablable‚Äù
[2023-08-30T00:34:54] Eric Howat: That‚Äôs what I like to hear James lol. Looking forward too it.
[2023-08-30T00:52:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Luckily our vesc is protected, even you put 12v it doesn‚Äôt die
[2023-08-30T00:52:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: Too much people do this error
[2023-08-30T00:57:38] Oreo huzky: Oof this will take years to balance out
[2023-08-30T00:58:17] Mirono escooters: Goh, could be worse
[2023-08-30T00:58:44] Eric Howat: What BMS is that?
[2023-08-30T00:59:56] Mirono escooters: Ant
[2023-08-30T01:00:45] Simone: Passive bms üòÅ
[2023-08-30T01:06:56] Mirono escooters: 160ma balancing tho
[2023-08-30T01:07:20] Oreo huzky: Ant 400A
[2023-08-30T02:21:31] Oreo huzky: What firmware would you recommend for flipsky 75100
[2023-08-30T06:02:10] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 75_100_V2?
[2023-08-30T12:42:01] Happy Giraffe: "Daly 35A has entered chat"
[2023-08-30T12:42:20] sombre_enfant: Add llt

[2023-08-30T20:39:54] Jason Nelson: I am getting an unbalanced current fault code when I try to run motor detection
[2023-08-30T20:47:04] Jason Nelson: I hooked an old 75100 up to a motor and ran detection. I can't remember what the condition of the controller was when I left it but I upgraded to the aluminum base version. I think I was getting a fault because I had a bad connection
[2023-08-30T20:47:12] Jason Nelson: Maybe it was a faulty controller
[2023-08-30T20:48:38] Jason Nelson: I'll try to reflash. Solder points look fine
[2023-08-30T20:53:47] JPPL: Turn off phase filter and don't plug any sides, like davega screen etc
[2023-08-30T20:53:57] JPPL: Then run detection
[2023-08-30T21:06:43] Jason Nelson: I think it's a hardware issue
[2023-08-30T21:10:02] Eric Howat: Is the VCC pin the 3.3v pin on a ubox v2?
[2023-08-30T21:10:20] Eric Howat: Cool just double checking thanks James
[2023-08-30T22:05:27] koxx / Francois Deslandes: welcome @edition0ne
[2023-08-30T22:19:53] Basti: can someone help me when stationary the duty goes up to 95 and 57 km/h but when i drive it only goes up to 50 and my gas lever only has a little play please
[2023-08-30T22:52:56] Happy Giraffe: You lack torque to use full speed
[2023-08-30T22:53:16] Happy Giraffe: Define 'little play'
[2023-08-30T23:10:03] Basti: So the gas lever only has a small way to full throttle, not like a normal e scooter xiaomi where you can accelerate normally
[2023-08-30T23:59:36] Eric Howat: What throttle are you using?
[2023-08-31T00:22:44] Gabe Enzo: why is alupcb better?
[2023-08-31T00:24:50] Gabe Enzo: what's a toll mosfet
[2023-08-31T00:24:59] Gabe Enzo: so non alu PCB is useless for scooters?
[2023-08-31T00:25:42] Gabe Enzo: no idea what that is. is it included? like whenI buy a VESC I don't need anything else
[2023-08-31T00:25:49] Gabe Enzo: its Gona be my first time with vesc

[2023-08-31T00:35:11] Gabe Enzo: Are those ESCs you got reliable? @Mirono_escooters I could think about paying you to ship to me. can they handle 100a continuous?
[2023-08-31T00:35:35] Gabe Enzo: even 70 is fine
[2023-08-31T00:35:46] Gabe Enzo: Ireland.

[2023-08-31T00:37:41] Gabe Enzo: how would go about bolting a flipsky to a frame
[2023-08-31T00:37:49] Gabe Enzo: weld a base on it?
[2023-08-31T00:37:51] Gabe Enzo: then screw?
[2023-08-31T00:37:57] Gabe Enzo: that easy huh
[2023-08-31T00:38:00] Gabe Enzo: wow

[2023-08-31T00:39:43] Mirono escooters: Ok izuna drew it, I made the drawings
[2023-08-31T00:40:12] Mirono escooters: Twas a joke

[2023-08-31T00:46:20] Mirono escooters: And don't cause overcurrent
[2023-08-31T00:46:29] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-08-31T00:46:42] Mirono escooters: For the price, it's dayum
[2023-08-31T00:46:50] Gabe Enzo: bat cutoff meaning like 3v per cell?
[2023-08-31T00:46:51] Mirono escooters: I'll use mine mostly for stupid projects that are doomed
[2023-08-31T00:47:06] Gabe Enzo: Yeah everything else seems like a giant ripoff
[2023-08-31T00:47:16] Gabe Enzo: here's the thing idk if to go with single or dual motor lol
[2023-08-31T00:47:28] Gabe Enzo: I feel like single motor will get too hot with a 20km cruise
[2023-08-31T00:47:35] Gabe Enzo: going like 70kmh you know?
[2023-08-31T00:47:40] Gabe Enzo: especially a 1000w Motor
[2023-08-31T00:48:46] Mirono escooters: Goh
[2023-08-31T00:48:51] Mirono escooters: Vesc usually cheap
[2023-08-31T00:49:03] Mirono escooters: You can always upgrade to 2 Esc over can
[2023-08-31T00:49:05] Mirono escooters: Thats the magic
[2023-08-31T00:49:12] Mirono escooters: Ah. ..
[2023-08-31T00:49:18] Mirono escooters: Depends if it's adequately sized
[2023-08-31T00:49:31] Gabe Enzo: Cheap 1000w off Amazon
[2023-08-31T00:49:34] Gabe Enzo: 100$
[2023-08-31T00:49:50] Mirono escooters: Oh boy
[2023-08-31T00:50:00] Gabe Enzo: bad idea huh
[2023-08-31T00:50:16] Gabe Enzo: that's why I'm thinking about dual
[2023-08-31T00:50:25] Gabe Enzo: half the load
[2023-08-31T05:53:01] Happy Giraffe: Tune adc and make custom curve
[2023-08-31T10:01:50] Basti: In air
[2023-08-31T10:02:21] Basti: In air ist 95 duty on road is 50 max why
[2023-08-31T10:40:39] Happy Giraffe: Tell us about your motor, battery current and motor current. Also batt voltage
[2023-08-31T11:04:19] Basti: 1000w 48v motor with 30amps and 72v battery with 16ah
[2023-08-31T11:18:55] Finn: 30A battery?
[2023-08-31T11:19:01] Finn: Obv current limit
[2023-08-31T11:42:01] Gabe Enzo: no load means nothing
[2023-08-31T11:42:31] Basti: Ok thanks i test it
[2023-08-31T18:57:38] Simone: Now I'm also in the +150kmh club üòú
[2023-08-31T18:57:39] Simone: <photos/photo_9523@31-08-2023_18-57-39.jpg>
[2023-08-31T18:58:17] Simone: the straight is too short...I think another 5kmh more is doable
[2023-08-31T19:00:53] Happy Giraffe: How do you guys stay alive? Deal with the devil?
[2023-08-31T19:07:09] Simone: I have 7 lives... like cats üòúüòÇ
[2023-08-31T19:07:55] Unknown: Azz
[2023-08-31T19:41:01] Simone: I arrive at about 90 from a big bend and then I have 350 meters of straight where I shoot for about 280/300m
[2023-08-31T19:43:59] JPPL: If I go highway I also think I can go faster
[2023-08-31T19:44:12] JPPL: But so dangerous :(
[2023-08-31T19:44:25] JPPL: And I need a Team to help me out
[2023-08-31T19:44:43] JPPL: Simone still Mantis?
[2023-08-31T19:45:03] JPPL: 150? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ üíã
[2023-08-31T19:45:26] Simone: the video you posted last time seems to be on a bit of a downhill road
[2023-08-31T19:45:45] Simone: No my 11inch with kelly 7230s
[2023-08-31T19:45:53] JPPL: It is, is my only safe test spot I have near by
[2023-08-31T19:46:40] JPPL: The costum vsett/11x , motors 70mm?
[2023-08-31T19:46:50] Simone: Yes
[2023-08-31T19:47:59] JPPL: What was your motor/battery current bro?
[2023-08-31T19:48:17] Gabe Enzo: Not rly
[2023-08-31T19:48:24] JPPL: Those 70mm overall seems good option
[2023-08-31T19:48:25] Gabe Enzo: highway is safe
[2023-08-31T19:48:34] Gabe Enzo: no cars turning
[2023-08-31T19:49:09] JPPL: Agree because it's perfect but police and cameras and blah blah that's what make me nervous, more easy to prove
[2023-08-31T19:49:30] JPPL: But soon I will üòÖ
[2023-08-31T19:49:47] JPPL: Then probably I quit speed testing
[2023-08-31T19:50:25] Simone: <photos/photo_9524@31-08-2023_19-50-25.jpg>
[2023-08-31T19:50:50] Gabe Enzo: Can power a household with that ü§≠

[2023-08-31T19:51:19] Simone: this is the peak i recorded...for almost the entire test i recorded 400A continuous
[2023-08-31T19:51:51] Gabe Enzo: that's like 10 minutes of runtime no ?
[2023-08-31T19:51:54] Gabe Enzo: Or am I wrong
[2023-08-31T19:52:02] Simone: Drop ~ 14v
[2023-08-31T19:52:32] JPPL: Yes obious huge drop with near 500a discharge ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2023-08-31T19:52:42] JPPL: Congrats bro! Just keep rocking!
[2023-08-31T19:52:56] Gabe Enzo: What if you're just crusing, what's the amps then Like 60kmh
[2023-08-31T19:52:57] Simone: Thanks jppl üòò
[2023-08-31T19:53:58] JPPL: He can manage also 3 speeds, so less current if he wants to go lower mode
[2023-08-31T19:53:58] Simone: not much...once launched you stay on 35/40A
[2023-08-31T20:00:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: House is 3kW Xd

[2023-09-01T12:46:17] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: My max was 142 on flat and 146 on a little downhill
[2023-09-01T12:48:11] sombre_enfant: What speed reach stock without increased section ?
[2023-09-01T12:48:57] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Same
[2023-09-01T12:49:19] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But faster overheat
[2023-09-01T12:59:06] Mirono escooters: Yah, that's impressive af
[2023-09-01T13:42:29] Gabe Enzo: There's nothing wrong with Connecting a LIPO with 18650s no? as long as they have seperate BMS systems.
[2023-09-01T13:42:49] Gabe Enzo: Like 20ah 20s and 5ah 2x 10s aka 20s
[2023-09-01T13:42:55] Gabe Enzo: to have in total 25ah 20s.
[2023-09-01T13:52:04] Gabe Enzo: Do you think it's a bit icky to do the same with 18650?
[2023-09-01T13:52:15] Gabe Enzo: I feel like so many packs working seperately is a bit dirty even with same chemistry
[2023-09-01T13:52:29] Gabe Enzo: but I mean theoretically and logically it *should* be ok
[2023-09-01T13:52:43] Gabe Enzo: What do you think?
[2023-09-01T13:54:22] Gabe Enzo: Only so much Wh you can fit in a Pro 2 form factor üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-09-01T13:54:36] Gabe Enzo: Need a wildman bag haha
[2023-09-01T14:14:14] Mirono escooters: I did sum tests w this
[2023-09-01T14:14:26] Mirono escooters: The tldr was It works, its not great, you'll kill the lipos But it gives nice boost.
[2023-09-01T14:28:06] Happy Giraffe: Dont use RC LiPos if you enjoy life
[2023-09-01T14:28:41] Happy Giraffe: Those behave abnormally and just get bloated one day without any reason. Unstable cell chemistry compared to Li-ion.
[2023-09-01T14:29:49] Mirono escooters: Goh
[2023-09-01T14:29:54] Mirono escooters: Not tru
[2023-09-01T14:29:59] Mirono escooters: Just different handling and caring for
[2023-09-01T14:30:34] Finn: maybe dont charge a 3p with 10A
[2023-09-01T14:31:00] Mirono escooters: Booring
[2023-09-01T14:31:07] Mirono escooters: Lipo handles more C, charge and discharge
[2023-09-01T14:31:32] Finn: ill just stick to my 2A charge
[2023-09-01T14:35:59] Happy Giraffe: Cant run 5 years reliably with rc lipo, never have seen one happen and never willüòÅ
[2023-09-01T14:36:57] Mihail: I only use rc lipo for welding
[2023-09-01T14:47:55] Mirono escooters: Comparing apples to pears
[2023-09-01T14:48:01] Mirono escooters: Not worth the discussion
[2023-09-01T14:50:14] Happy Giraffe: Exactly why I said it, vulnerability to errors that often lead to fireüòÇ
[2023-09-01T14:51:05] Happy Giraffe: I bet they aren't rc lipos. Some people talk about lipo as in our mobile phones. Thats li-ion in reality
[2023-09-01T14:51:17] Happy Giraffe: Batt department fucked up naming scheme
[2023-09-01T14:54:03] Mirono escooters: Alibaba
[2023-09-01T14:54:38] Mirono escooters: Goh
[2023-09-01T15:12:51] Gabe Enzo: I kept one of my LIPOs at 30% (storage charge) and it was flat for 7 years.
[2023-09-01T15:13:05] Gabe Enzo: Yes.
[2023-09-01T15:15:04] Gabe Enzo: only hobbyking.com LIPOs are "safe''
[2023-09-01T15:15:35] Gabe Enzo: They are ohm matched.
[2023-09-01T15:16:03] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2023-09-01T15:16:10] Mirono escooters: You think others dont do that
[2023-09-01T15:16:18] Mirono escooters: And that ohm matching is the only safety thing üòÇüòÇ
[2023-09-01T15:16:24] Mirono escooters: Sometimes you say so weird stuff man
[2023-09-01T15:16:30] puneDir: Whats bad with lion?
[2023-09-01T15:16:35] puneDir: lipo is more dangereus
[2023-09-01T15:16:37] Gabe Enzo: ones straight from china aren't.
[2023-09-01T15:16:47] Mirono escooters: Less powr
[2023-09-01T15:16:57] Mirono escooters: Have a guess where HobbyKing is made
[2023-09-01T15:17:11] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-09-01T15:17:27] puneDir: true but with enough paralels its fine
[2023-09-01T15:17:31] Gabe Enzo: I know. but I'm just saying I feel safer using those than some no name eBay brand
[2023-09-01T15:17:40] Mirono escooters: You do you
[2023-09-01T15:17:43] Gabe Enzo: The issue is the air gap when making packs with cylinder cells
[2023-09-01T15:17:48] Gabe Enzo: Its like 35% air

[2023-09-01T15:18:01] puneDir: Thats the cell in my ninebot battery
[2023-09-01T15:18:11] puneDir: Seems like they changed it with this
[2023-09-01T15:18:18] Mirono escooters: Most trustworthy site üíÄüíÄ
[2023-09-01T15:18:53] Mirono escooters: There are li ion pouch cells btw. Ive got sum Very nicce ones. Only makes sense in big sizes tho
[2023-09-01T15:19:10] Gabe Enzo: Are they prone to ballooning?
[2023-09-01T15:19:19] puneDir: thats sad
[2023-09-01T15:19:38] puneDir: i hope they wont explode spontaneusly
[2023-09-01T15:19:46] Happy Giraffe: My phone specs have said lipo with HTC etc
[2023-09-01T15:20:20] Gabe Enzo: it IS lipo. The reason it's safe is because the lower C rate equates to less chance of ballooning and instability.
[2023-09-01T15:20:33] Gabe Enzo: The lower C Rate also = more Wh / gram
[2023-09-01T15:21:01] Happy Giraffe: Oh no wtf who makes from this?
[2023-09-01T15:21:21] Gabe Enzo: inb4 before AK tells me to stop going off topic
[2023-09-01T15:21:40] puneDir: Probably its some aliexpress replacement battery
[2023-09-01T15:21:42] Happy Giraffe: Nope
[2023-09-01T15:22:15] Happy Giraffe: RC lipo and lipo nowadays two different things but I explained it already. Fucked up industry
[2023-09-01T15:33:58] Happy Giraffe: And they should be called Li-ion-Poly insteadüòÇ Li-ion, RC Li-Po and Li-ion-Po kinda same but different usecase tuned and feature set so no RC Lipo on phoneüòÅ
[2023-09-01T15:39:35] Mirono escooters: Its li ion
[2023-09-01T15:43:49] Happy Giraffe: Lithium ion polymerüòÅ
[2023-09-01T15:44:32] Mirono escooters: ü•¥
[2023-09-01T18:01:56] sombre_enfant: Why they put alupcb now ?
[2023-09-01T18:13:31] Mirono escooters: " Better "
[2023-09-01T18:13:32] Mirono escooters: Debatable
[2023-09-01T18:13:35] Mirono escooters: I like, except repair
[2023-09-01T18:15:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: Thinner layer of insulation , and better thermal conduction I think
[2023-09-01T18:15:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: But is useless if they fix it with m2 Philips screw
[2023-09-01T18:26:39] Mirono escooters: Tis just to hold while the glue dry
[2023-09-01T18:26:47] Mirono escooters: It's glued to the back, like alupcb to case
[2023-09-01T18:39:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: Xd
[2023-09-01T18:39:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: So is basically useless in this case
[2023-09-01T18:45:37] Mirono escooters: ü§∑
[2023-09-01T18:53:16] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: they should rather redesign the case
[2023-09-01T19:08:59] Happy Giraffe: Waterproof! With a mount
[2023-09-01T19:09:58] Gabe Enzo: they should fix them with a clamp array that pressurises with springs.
[2023-09-01T19:10:00] Gabe Enzo: Just a thought.
[2023-09-01T19:26:44] Mirono escooters: Just some good screws work
[2023-09-01T19:27:20] Mirono escooters: Goh, its fine as is imoüòß
[2023-09-01T19:27:23] Mirono escooters: Smol form factor
[2023-09-01T19:27:46] Mirono escooters: Alupcb for more power
[2023-09-01T19:28:30] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Not change much, remove the legs and make the surface where the FETs are screwed on flat and thiccer
[2023-09-01T19:28:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and put the legs on this side
[2023-09-01T19:28:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: So FETs will always be mounted to something solid by customers
[2023-09-01T19:29:26] Mirono escooters: Goh
[2023-09-01T19:29:30] Mirono escooters: That's something yeah
[2023-09-01T19:29:36] Mirono escooters: Still to220 ü§∑
[2023-09-01T19:36:30] sombre_enfant: Any help ? And i cant detect the other one by canbus and the led is not turned on
[2023-09-01T20:55:35] sombre_enfant: That means its dead ???
[2023-09-01T21:00:42] sombre_enfant: I flashed another out of vesc tool beta

[2023-09-01T21:02:37] sombre_enfant: Tomorow i do stlink then
[2023-09-01T21:02:49] Mirono escooters: You problably flashed wrong fw yes
[2023-09-01T21:05:21] sombre_enfant: Atleast my battery works now
[2023-09-01T21:22:05] Mirono escooters: @Happy_Giraffe
[2023-09-01T21:22:12] Mirono escooters: Best concept
[2023-09-01T22:26:26] Eric Howat: Is a 75v vesc safe to run a 72v battery on?
[2023-09-01T22:26:43] Mirono escooters: Check what the description says
[2023-09-01T22:27:13] Eric Howat: Just was asking out of theory but thanks!
[2023-09-01T22:30:39] Mirono escooters: Well, some 75v aren't 75v etcetera 75100 is 20s supported But then some others not
[2023-09-01T22:30:43] Mirono escooters: It's confusing. No real rules
[2023-09-01T22:30:58] Eric Howat: That‚Äôs kind of what I figured
[2023-09-01T23:19:12] Happy Giraffe: Looks nice
[2023-09-01T23:19:41] Happy Giraffe: Loctite bukkake and might hold
[2023-09-01T23:27:49] Mirono escooters: 2 screws clamping axle
[2023-09-02T00:31:30] Gabe Enzo: @kawaiinekololis said 75100 ESC is made for 20s.
[2023-09-02T00:31:47] Gabe Enzo: Not peak voltage but voltage during virtual zero load.
[2023-09-02T00:31:53] Gabe Enzo: It drops as soon as you connect something
[2023-09-02T00:31:59] Gabe Enzo: that connection being said ESC
[2023-09-02T00:33:25] Gabe Enzo: Yes some 75 escs say 16s only which is hilarious
[2023-09-02T00:34:26] Gabe Enzo: I assume those are the shit ones you shouldn't be getting anwyays
[2023-09-02T00:52:31] Gabe Enzo: if only castle creations made VESCs üò´üò´

[2023-09-02T03:16:18] JPPL: Little good doble controller
[2023-09-02T09:44:10] Mirono escooters: Having your dropouts not spin to death Usually in high power ebikes
[2023-09-02T11:09:59] Mirono escooters: Thats fine for a lot of stuff

[2023-09-02T13:03:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: 6.2 firmware ?
[2023-09-02T13:11:33] Happy Giraffe: I guess also phase soldering is good
[2023-09-02T13:13:14] Happy Giraffe: Can it be some filtering error for motor or some observer issue?
[2023-09-02T13:13:24] Nick: Is 72v enough to run air bag suspension instead of a rear coilover on a 250lb bike?
[2023-09-02T13:14:18] Nick: The air bag would be hooked up to a compressor that would use battery
[2023-09-02T13:14:25] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_9531@02-09-2023_13-14-25.jpg>
[2023-09-02T13:14:43] Nick: I know on grom u have to do wierd stuff but idk if a full electric bike it's just plug and play or even wierder
[2023-09-02T13:14:44] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Check how much the adc signal from the sensor fluctuates, maybe it's interference
[2023-09-02T13:17:41] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You can check it on adc mapping window
[2023-09-02T13:17:48] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: While running motor freewheel
[2023-09-02T13:18:16] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: If its dropping or really jittery, then thats the answer
[2023-09-02T13:18:41] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Also be sure adc 2 not triggering priority of the adc 1 with same interference
[2023-09-02T13:19:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: Go 5.3 and test
[2023-09-02T13:20:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes could be that also

[2023-09-02T21:12:25] Eric Howat: Or is it usable for a brake light?
[2023-09-02T21:13:02] JPPL: Brake light

[2023-09-03T09:02:58] Nick: Potentially a stupid question here but would it be possible to make a powerful battery out of like 2000 rechargable AA batteries?
[2023-09-03T09:06:34] puneDir: I tried with 9v ones
[2023-09-03T09:06:48] puneDir: if you do like 1000 paralel why not
[2023-09-03T09:06:55] puneDir: but its for only one use
[2023-09-03T09:07:03] Nick: 2s1000p lmao
[2023-09-03T09:07:07] puneDir: and bad idea
[2023-09-03T09:07:13] Nick: They'd be rechargable ones
[2023-09-03T09:07:22] puneDir: why would u do that
[2023-09-03T09:07:23] Nick: Someone at worked mentioning having a lot for some reason
[2023-09-03T09:07:38] Nick: He just has like 10k batteries in his house idk why
[2023-09-03T09:07:44] Nick: He isn't even into electronics
[2023-09-03T09:07:47] puneDir: Hehe
[2023-09-03T09:08:05] puneDir: 18650s is the king
[2023-09-03T09:08:07] puneDir: and 21700
[2023-09-03T09:08:33] Nick: I saw on FB someone made a lifepo pack which looked really cool
[2023-09-03T09:08:49] Nick: Like fat 18650 sorta
[2023-09-03T09:09:17] Nick: When I used to vape I always had loose 18650 in my pocket
[2023-09-03T09:09:28] puneDir: I would prefer lion over lifepo for e scooters
[2023-09-03T09:09:39] Nick: What about for a motorcycle?
[2023-09-03T09:09:49] puneDir: Bms issues Im not into them Less voltage Less discharge (im not sure)
[2023-09-03T09:10:13] puneDir: They have nice lifespan if you make it with pouch ones it will be nice
[2023-09-03T09:10:23] puneDir: For ev cars and motorbikes
[2023-09-03T09:10:39] Nick: I have a 72v 35ah hopefully done soon in lithium but I like the idea of making another bike maybe a dirtbike style one and using wierd shit like DeWalt or AA batteries to power it
[2023-09-03T09:11:12] Nick: He's supposed to ship soon hoepppfully. Last piece I need before I can finish the bike in my living room

[2023-09-03T09:43:29] Gabe Enzo: Can't fit the watts
[2023-09-03T09:43:41] Gabe Enzo: there are AA 18650s.
[2023-09-03T09:43:48] Gabe Enzo: You could use those üòÇ
[2023-09-03T09:43:58] Gabe Enzo: they are very high discharge
[2023-09-03T09:44:04] Nick: I think the ones dude has are the rechargeable energizer onea
[2023-09-03T09:44:15] Gabe Enzo: not real lithium chemistry
[2023-09-03T09:44:20] Gabe Enzo: ain't rechargable
[2023-09-03T09:44:33] Nick: Oh do they degrade quickly?
[2023-09-03T09:45:41] Gabe Enzo: They simply aren't real Lithium, they are 3 volts and can't be recharged
[2023-09-03T09:45:48] Gabe Enzo: Consumer shit is incredibly horrible
[2023-09-03T09:46:13] Gabe Enzo: to this day I wonder why normies buy new batteries instead of buying rechargeable AA
[2023-09-03T09:46:32] Gabe Enzo: i asked people at school and they said "wtf is a rechargeable battery"
[2023-09-03T09:47:13] Gabe Enzo: easily thousands of dollars worth per decade.
[2023-09-03T09:47:40] Nick: I think these ones actually do recharge you can put them on a little battery charger
[2023-09-03T09:48:28] Nick: I had the same kind for my VR controllers I remember they recharged. To be fair I didn't try to drive a dirtbike on those thoigh
[2023-09-03T09:52:57] Gabe Enzo: amp draw is shit
[2023-09-03T09:53:11] Gabe Enzo: only for Vr and stuff
[2023-09-03T09:54:01] Mirono escooters: Nimh technology sucks
[2023-09-03T09:56:57] Gabe Enzo: we used to use NiMH for RC back in the stone age, then I tried a LIPO soon after and couldn't believe the power difference.
[2023-09-03T09:57:32] Gabe Enzo: I was like how the hell do these pillow things give so much power
[2023-09-03T13:11:02] Happy Giraffe: Anyone else notice now with 6.2 motor detection gives some random values sometimes?
[2023-09-03T13:11:14] Happy Giraffe: I got 190mohm and after that 54üåö
[2023-09-03T13:24:14] Mirono escooters: Yeh
[2023-09-03T13:24:16] Mirono escooters: Sometimes buggy
[2023-09-03T13:24:21] Mirono escooters: Also diff versions different values

[2023-09-03T13:54:31] Pablo Fernandez: Indeed
[2023-09-03T14:26:43] Jan: De motor temps üëå
[2023-09-03T14:27:27] Jan: Everybody elses motor would have blown
[2023-09-03T14:27:54] Jan: Self wound motor?
[2023-09-03T14:28:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: nope haha, only holes on side covers to keep those under 170¬∞C :p
[2023-09-03T14:57:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: Hahaha Quentin did a mistake, he started with mode 1 so 36Kmh max üòÇ
[2023-09-03T14:59:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, or they were safe brakers guys haha
[2023-09-03T14:59:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: Some were using high kv but braking very early
[2023-09-03T15:00:23] Face de Pin Suc√©: We will make more in spain in 2 weeks
[2023-09-03T15:00:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: This time one camera per pilot (3 Rage Mechanics pilots)
[2023-09-03T15:00:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: So I'll be able to match the 3 videos and play with hehe
[2023-09-03T15:01:39] Luis Magalhaes: Need to do more videos like this üòÅüëåüëå
[2023-09-03T15:01:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, only build and go on track for fun
[2023-09-03T15:02:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: But my pilots are much better than me
[2023-09-03T15:02:32] Face de Pin Suc√©: So I need them to race to show Rage Mechanics is best hehehe
[2023-09-03T16:08:00] Face de Pin Suc√©: :o
[2023-09-03T16:10:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: Anyway, this is a shitty throttle x) didn't know people still buying it
[2023-09-03T16:12:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: 130X for me
[2023-09-03T16:12:20] Face de Pin Suc√©: 270X in second
[2023-09-03T16:12:46] Face de Pin Suc√©: What I don't like with 270X is all body turns but yes more beautiful
[2023-09-03T17:05:38] JPPL: 130x the best
[2023-09-03T17:06:05] JPPL: Good idea develop one similar all metal
[2023-09-03T17:06:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: Why no good 300x
[2023-09-03T17:07:11] JPPL: The curve, more outside thumb
[2023-09-03T17:07:20] JPPL: Also response is different 100%
[2023-09-03T17:08:13] JPPL: I think I tested quite few, 130x is unique behaviour, sensitive, naturally conformable
[2023-09-03T17:08:57] JPPL: You can even do manual cruise control üòÇ where your thumb skin block the rotation, not possible on others
[2023-09-03T17:08:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, 300x is the worst
[2023-09-03T17:09:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: Exacty why I love 130X
[2023-09-03T17:09:16] JPPL: This is personal taste but recommend over all
[2023-09-03T17:09:28] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ye, because we had the same problems with people and motor reacts the same, so i already know and can suppose that it was interference
[2023-09-03T17:09:29] JPPL: Details ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2023-09-03T17:10:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: You can choose the throttle fluidity just by having more skin on body of throttle haha
[2023-09-03T17:11:12] JPPL: Bastard finger üòù
[2023-09-03T17:12:43] Gabe Enzo: there's versions of this just being a voltmeter with ignition
[2023-09-03T17:13:06] JPPL: It's funny cuz I just use it in on one of my scooters, others have different acelerator, it's nice cuz I train thumb movements with more variety

[2023-09-03T17:16:00] JPPL: Other funny thing is that I make my top speed with the one I most dislike üòÇüòÇ
[2023-09-03T17:17:07] JPPL: Would be nice some tutorial videos online with this kind of products
[2023-09-03T17:21:47] JPPL: The worst üëé
[2023-09-03T17:22:09] JPPL: Maybe good for ebikes or other type of riding
[2023-09-03T17:24:29] Alin Ciobanu: Good evening, I can‚Äôt change firmware to FLIPSKY 75100
[2023-09-03T17:25:40] Alin Ciobanu: And did it happen to someone?
[2023-09-03T17:26:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: Bootloader
[2023-09-03T17:39:11] Alin Ciobanu: ?
[2023-09-03T17:39:26] Alin Ciobanu: Non funziona ne da pc che telefono
[2023-09-03T17:45:01] Happy Giraffe: Wow
[2023-09-03T17:45:49] Happy Giraffe: BestüòÇ
[2023-09-03T18:00:49] Unknown: english
[2023-09-03T18:21:20] Alin Ciobanu: Ho risolto toccando il bootloader
[2023-09-03T18:21:27] Alin Ciobanu: <photos/photo_9542@03-09-2023_18-21-27.jpg>
[2023-09-03T18:56:34] sombre_enfant: U used custom fw ?
[2023-09-03T21:09:40] Mirono escooters: Makerbase has a thiccer, but finless case And flipsky has thinner but with fins Or both have new finless case?
[2023-09-03T21:09:44] Mirono escooters: I only ordered makerbase so
[2023-09-03T23:24:19] Alin Ciobanu: No, 6.02 default
[2023-09-03T23:24:30] Alin Ciobanu: <photos/photo_9543@03-09-2023_23-24-30.jpg>
[2023-09-03T23:24:51] Alin Ciobanu: It doesn‚Äôt make me connect
[2023-09-04T00:03:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Get newer vesc app version
[2023-09-04T00:27:13] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It's not the app version causing this fault, but there is no connection from the ble module to the vesc. Might check if TX and RX needs to be swapped and if it's connected to the correct port.
[2023-09-04T00:34:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt think after switching firmware the rx and tx wire goes magically auto reversed
[2023-09-04T00:45:52] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No of course not, but he never said if it worked before and I know that this has nothing to do with the app version or firmware version. It's a connectivity issue.
[2023-09-04T03:26:17] Alin Ciobanu: I was wrong to put Rx and Tx
[2023-09-04T03:35:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: ‚òπÔ∏è
[2023-09-04T05:18:27] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: hEJE
[2023-09-04T05:33:48] rosheee: now u her pimp xD?
[2023-09-04T05:34:29] rosheee: nah just use translat0r dulitsky rly suc√© video and adv. can't wait for your fuckeria g30, snsc and more
[2023-09-04T05:35:35] rosheee: and we do it in swiss german ^^ so GL HF google translator first we finish the g30's then start gt2 but i think we just drop 20S. we don't know which esc's and use tronic 250R for testing if dulitsky go more fuckeria then we just ask elon for ESC 's and 40S20P + seat with 40S20P then 80S20P with 10" vsett motors ofc and ferrofluid + 120mm discs and xtech hyperperformancesystem for braking maybe we go for tuovt high performance tires and fuckeria aliexpress tubes
[2023-09-04T05:37:52] rosheee: atm we run PLA brake discs
[2023-09-04T05:39:20] rosheee: seems legit for never stopped so i think we also put on front motor a dynamo and connect it to a fan which push air into our highperformance legit sail
[2023-09-04T08:22:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: wha
[2023-09-04T09:28:11] Alin Ciobanu: At first I had problems, because of shitty pc For the Bluetooth connection I was wrong to connect rx-tx

[2023-09-04T10:06:20] Gordan Gizdic: So yeah, i think well manage to convince him to do so. üòÖ
[2023-09-04T10:06:40] Mirono escooters: Kelly is ancient dinosaur
[2023-09-04T10:08:02] Gordan Gizdic: Ahahaha... hell write his specs so we can help him choose which vesc to get.
[2023-09-04T10:08:10] Gordan Gizdic: Plan is to do this over winter.
[2023-09-04T10:08:12] Unknown: Yes im considering what we can do on Qs205 . Now is Kelly 7230s pushing 12kw . But Kelly is old snd missing some options .
[2023-09-04T10:09:36] Mirono escooters: Nice stealth bomber
[2023-09-04T10:09:38] Unknown: Battery 20s8p Molicell P42 , 300 Amp Ant bms . Battery can handle 200 amps with no problem..

[2023-09-04T10:11:50] Unknown: <photos/photo_9546@04-09-2023_10-11-50.jpg>
[2023-09-04T10:13:28] Mirono escooters: Problably
[2023-09-04T10:16:26] Unknown: Yes it is simple just -/+ from Battery anf hal wire for reading speed that it .
[2023-09-04T10:17:56] Unknown: So That or Cl350 would be good option for some 15kw ? That is ok and motor is heating on hills sometime, on flats never. It have Hubsinks snd Ferofluid .
[2023-09-04T10:23:44] Mirono escooters: Qs273

[2023-09-04T11:45:40] Unknown: Yep im ok with setup that i have, but i like to try new things .. so if Vesc is better than Kelly i would try üòÇ just hope it does not overheat ..
[2023-09-04T11:46:24] Gabe Enzo: Lol to whatever amount VESC heats it will heat LESS than any generic controller.
[2023-09-04T11:47:04] Gabe Enzo: these guys will help u choose the right one
[2023-09-04T11:47:34] Unknown: Ok ok, im now reading about It and im trying to chosse good one

[2023-09-04T12:14:45] Unknown: Yep that way i have it from battery
[2023-09-04T12:14:51] Gordan Gizdic: Jus watch our not to connect them wrong... but ill help about that so no worries.
[2023-09-04T12:15:00] Gabe Enzo: So scary soldering on live batts haha especially with multiple KW output
[2023-09-04T12:15:02] Gordan Gizdic: QS8 better option.

[2023-09-04T12:21:36] Gabe Enzo: I connected 2 BMS last week in parallel instead of series üòÇ magic smoke galore
[2023-09-04T12:21:51] Gabe Enzo: smelled like a wasteland
[2023-09-04T12:21:55] Mirono escooters: Parallel is fine too, idk what you did wrong
[2023-09-04T12:22:16] Gabe Enzo: 84v batt with 42v connection
[2023-09-04T12:22:22] Gabe Enzo: It was My fault

[2023-09-04T12:23:23] Mirono escooters: Fml
[2023-09-04T12:23:24] Gabe Enzo: this was when I started to respect punedir because I realized I dumber than he is
[2023-09-04T12:23:24] Unknown: Two is better than one , less heat , Poland guys do that way always for 150amp plus batterys
[2023-09-04T12:23:37] Mirono escooters: Yah, you new punedir
[2023-09-04T12:23:58] puneDir: cmon i do proper stuff now
[2023-09-04T12:24:13] Gabe Enzo: I bought a new BMS but it's so big üíÄ It's not gonna look clean
[2023-09-04T12:24:17] Gordan Gizdic: I pulled 600A on one of those connectors, never had issues. It was not even warm.
[2023-09-04T12:25:15] Gabe Enzo: I only joined the Community 4 months ago haha. before that I was only into RC shit and thought I was smart because I knew what lipo and brushless was
[2023-09-04T12:25:23] Gabe Enzo: DUMB asf
[2023-09-04T12:25:36] Gabe Enzo: that's insane

[2023-09-04T12:27:38] Unknown: I work with them 4 years , always great battery!
[2023-09-04T12:32:53] Unknown: So Vesc is sensitive to sparks , hmm ?
[2023-09-04T12:32:57] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-09-04T12:33:01] Mirono escooters: Never ever experienced. Or heard
[2023-09-04T12:49:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: If you need some, I have in stock ready to ship
[2023-09-04T12:49:58] Unknown: V4 white one with dctodc build in ?
[2023-09-04T12:54:14] Gordan Gizdic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kBJGPN4neU
[2023-09-04T12:55:26] Gordan Gizdic: This little thing when it was doing its best runs in the 250kmh region pulled over 600A from batteries during those runs. And i used to do multiple in a row while testing. Mind you, 8S system @ 600A is a looooot of power in such a small package.

[2023-09-04T12:59:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes
[2023-09-04T12:59:29] Face de Pin Suc√©: We are only one to have in stock, even 3Shul doesn't have stock üòÇ
[2023-09-04T12:59:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: But they are not white, they are painted
[2023-09-04T13:00:25] Unknown: Great i will let you know tomorow, tell me canle harness comes with controller, do you know how lon are batery cables that goes out grom controller ?
[2023-09-04T13:01:20] Unknown: Sorry for spelling , mobile phone does some bad things üòÇ
[2023-09-04T13:02:10] Gordan Gizdic: 3Shul comes with connctor that you need to crimp yourself.
[2023-09-04T13:02:16] Gordan Gizdic: Ill do wiring with you.
[2023-09-04T13:03:13] Unknown: Ok, im asking because i need minimum 20 cm battery cable lenght üôå
[2023-09-04T13:03:40] Gordan Gizdic: Not a problem, well make it work.
[2023-09-04T13:07:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: Will make cable harness soon because it is often asked
[2023-09-04T13:12:17] Unknown: So it does not have any connectors ? I can crimp connectors no problem but im Just asking
[2023-09-04T13:15:45] Gordan Gizdic: It comes with connectors, but the connector is not finished... sou you have to finish it.
[2023-09-04T13:16:11] Gordan Gizdic: Dobije≈° ≈æice, konektor, te limiƒáe i sve ≈°to ti treba... samo ga mora≈° slo≈æiti prema tome ≈°to tebi odgovara.

[2023-09-04T14:25:31] Happy Giraffe: Guess I take fucking bus tomorrow
[2023-09-04T14:26:07] Happy Giraffe: Pulled broken bearing out, inner piece came out, outer stayed in
[2023-09-04T14:26:31] Happy Giraffe: Requires special tools to open. I will make the tool myself tomorrow....
[2023-09-04T14:27:04] Happy Giraffe: And meanwhile ordering Mxus motor from NexunüòÖ
[2023-09-04T14:35:43] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, fucking overheating
[2023-09-04T14:36:39] Happy Giraffe: Yeah instant 70¬∞c and then raises 5¬∞ every uphill
[2023-09-04T14:37:21] Happy Giraffe: Only for so low power use only. Mxus 3K turbo or 30H will be next for this bike. After that I try to build the second one...
[2023-09-04T14:49:59] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, seems like an only option if I dont want a mid drive (I dont on my main daily commuterüòÅ)
[2023-09-04T14:51:41] Happy Giraffe: This pushes the budget away from my DH bike, grrrü§¨
[2023-09-04T15:07:31] D J: @SibClimb do you advise updating the original fw of the C350 to 6.02?
[2023-09-04T15:14:28] Face de Pin Suc√©: Nope, I prefer 5.3
[2023-09-04T15:29:02] Happy Giraffe: But makes current bike more powerful and usableüòÅ
[2023-09-04T15:47:56] D J: Do you prefer the 5.3 than the 6.00?
[2023-09-04T16:07:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes
[2023-09-04T16:37:05] Oreo huzky: Any updates on cl350
[2023-09-04T17:14:21] Happy Giraffe: Why wont fuking QS make ebike motor for 135/140mm dropouts like the mxus but bigger diameter and more copper?üåö
[2023-09-04T17:14:45] Happy Giraffe: Im ready to weld torque arms capable of stopping a 120mm rheinmetall cannon now
[2023-09-04T17:18:59] Gabe Enzo: wdym by dropouts?
[2023-09-04T17:19:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: Under testings
[2023-09-04T17:20:34] Happy Giraffe: Contact points of mounting motor, dropout is the name of the part of fork/frame
[2023-09-04T17:40:02] D J: good to know.can you send me the file to try? thanks
[2023-09-04T17:41:53] Gabe Enzo: do you mean can motors?
[2023-09-04T17:42:34] Gabe Enzo: mid drive motors overheat cos they have no wind cooling
[2023-09-04T17:42:37] Gabe Enzo: I think*
[2023-09-04T17:43:27] Gabe Enzo: Nothing better than spending 2 months wages on a bunch of hunks of metal right
[2023-09-04T17:53:18] Happy Giraffe: Yes, its insane how well LR motor can do 3000-5000w continuous barely above ambientüò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥
[2023-09-04T17:53:56] Happy Giraffe: They have heat source directly at the housing of motor that directly cools from wind
[2023-09-04T17:54:39] Happy Giraffe: Scooter/hub motor has heat source inside motor so harder to cool as heat has to travel longer and harder path
[2023-09-04T18:00:45] Gabe Enzo: been a decade since I heard that term
[2023-09-04T18:00:48] Gabe Enzo: Damn
[2023-09-04T18:01:02] Gabe Enzo: easy to water cool too
[2023-09-04T18:03:19] Face de Pin Suc√©: For 6.2 ?
[2023-09-04T18:07:50] Happy Giraffe: Not needed as direct air is best if you ride 30kmh+. Water good for stationary pulling
[2023-09-04T18:08:15] Happy Giraffe: Btw found QS 212. A larger diameter "1200w" continuous rated 35HüòÅ
[2023-09-04T18:08:24] Happy Giraffe: Should give nice torque
[2023-09-04T18:09:13] Mirono escooters: :(

[2023-09-04T18:14:56] D J: If you have 5.3 and 6.2 send it...so try it and see which one I like more
[2023-09-04T18:15:18] Oreo huzky: Thanks
[2023-09-04T18:23:46] Gabe Enzo: does anyone know how to wrap a battery with no heat gun? Will a blow dryer work?
[2023-09-04T18:23:55] Gabe Enzo: too scared to use a blowtorth it might fuck it up
[2023-09-04T18:24:05] Gabe Enzo: got no ideas

[2023-09-04T18:30:30] Happy Giraffe: I never understood their graphs, but 2146w and 109Nm torque sounds good
[2023-09-04T18:35:48] Happy Giraffe: But as this is done with 2v motor emf then phase can be theoretically 1000A soüòÖ
[2023-09-04T18:57:34] Happy Giraffe: Wider magnet vs wider diameterü§î
[2023-09-04T18:58:06] Happy Giraffe: You did diy battery?
[2023-09-04T18:58:48] Gabe Enzo: nah just 2 Xiaomi batteries together for 20s.
[2023-09-04T18:59:08] Gabe Enzo: its a nice little 13ah
[2023-09-04T18:59:12] Gabe Enzo: not too bad
[2023-09-04T18:59:30] Gabe Enzo: thinking of making a pack tho just spot welders are so goddamn expensive
[2023-09-04T18:59:46] Gabe Enzo: Thinking of 20s 13ah + 20s 13ah in parallel
[2023-09-04T19:00:16] Gabe Enzo: Just I'm worried about buying cells that don't discharge at the same rate and I'm unsure what effect that will have on my system
[2023-09-04T19:01:16] Gabe Enzo: i had to shave off so much plastic and still it didn't fit cause I used tape to hold it together but due to that tape, it won't fit so I'm trying heatshrink for the first time.

[2023-09-04T19:10:29] Unknown: Do any of you did have Kelly before now Vsec , what is the bigest difference ?
[2023-09-04T19:20:28] Gabe Enzo: that's series.
[2023-09-04T19:20:41] Gabe Enzo: I didn't put the Y plug in that picture
[2023-09-04T19:27:50] Alin Ciobanu: Ah ok
[2023-09-04T19:28:20] Alin Ciobanu: For charging you use two chargers ?
[2023-09-04T19:43:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, and Kelly is really shit compared to VESC
[2023-09-04T19:43:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: VESC has better motor control
[2023-09-04T19:43:49] Face de Pin Suc√©: better parameters
[2023-09-04T19:43:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: better throttle response

[2023-09-04T20:27:06] Jason Nelson: Hey, when I first start riding when I engage the adc2 for the brakes it cuts out with an overcurrent error and I have to slow down and engage the adc2 before the throttle can engage again. Does anyone know what is happening? My max brake current is set to -120
[2023-09-04T20:27:36] Jason Nelson: It will do it 2 or 3 times
[2023-09-04T20:27:44] Jason Nelson: Then it won't do it again

[2023-09-04T22:08:46] Gabe Enzo: that's like saying should I mix 2 eggs before cooking them
[2023-09-04T22:08:50] Gabe Enzo: Won't change anything

[2023-09-05T13:28:44] Happy Giraffe: @PaoloWu how much does it cost if a private person ships 10kg motor from china to EU (Finland)
[2023-09-05T13:30:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: Train?
[2023-09-05T13:36:49] Face de Pin Suc√©: Private person by air will cost around 15-18$/Kg
[2023-09-05T13:37:02] Face de Pin Suc√©: Maybe even more I think
[2023-09-05T13:45:37] Happy Giraffe: Seems aligned with their prices but theirs is not air for sureüòÇ
[2023-09-05T13:45:53] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, does train take like 10-14 days?

[2023-09-05T15:00:26] Nik: no need, double stem very stable, but yeah it helps if you go above 100kmh, just one tho not 3 thing isn't an Hayabusa turbo üòÇüòÇüò≠üò≠
[2023-09-05T15:02:54] Nik: for instance, this is stock

[2023-09-05T15:10:50] Mirono escooters: @VioletViolencee
[2023-09-05T15:11:14] Martin Kaktits: no

[2023-09-05T15:16:14] Nik: if you have a long long street, slightly downhill you get over 110kmh on stock Wolf King gt, but I'm not looking for much higher speed... I want torque üòÅ
[2023-09-05T15:16:32] rosheee: Ah i put vesc in
[2023-09-05T15:16:39] rosheee: Then wanted kelly
[2023-09-05T15:16:59] Nik: we hit 118 gps so I know what u mean, double stem is still impressive to me compared to C shape at high speed
[2023-09-05T15:17:44] rosheee: It isnt about dual or quadrupel stem ^^
[2023-09-05T15:17:56] Nik: Monza racetrack straight, 10% incline downhill 1.2km long

[2023-09-05T15:19:06] rosheee: Never 100kmh when it was stock
[2023-09-05T15:19:28] rosheee: Or me never had 100
[2023-09-05T15:19:37] Nik: 118 iPhone GPS
[2023-09-05T15:19:52] rosheee: XD with stock wolfking gt and stock tires?
[2023-09-05T15:19:58] Nik: wasn't even mine, mine couldn't do more than 114, I don't know what to tell you guys this is what we had over a year ago
[2023-09-05T15:20:17] rosheee: Backwind
[2023-09-05T15:20:31] Nik: yes, CST tyres are faster than pmts if you actually tried them
[2023-09-05T15:20:41] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes but what about 0Kmh ?
[2023-09-05T15:20:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: Minimotors is slower than sine wave version , but even sine don‚Äôt goes more than 105 in optimal condition
[2023-09-05T15:20:56] Nik: you spin more at beginning but you end up being faster cause more contact surface things are bricks
[2023-09-05T15:21:02] rosheee: Yas
[2023-09-05T15:21:06] Nik: compared to like 90 juniors

[2023-09-05T15:23:33] rosheee: I had one
[2023-09-05T15:23:35] Nik: cause you don't know what wind and gravity are clearly my dude
[2023-09-05T15:23:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: Is it possible to start from 0kmh without pushing and not having stuttering ? Or am I asking too much to it ?
[2023-09-05T15:23:58] Nik: tbh materials wise, that thing is shit
[2023-09-05T15:24:25] Nik: or maybe there's a 10% incline on a 1.2km straight with trees creating a wind tunnell?
[2023-09-05T15:24:44] rosheee: Vacuum?
[2023-09-05T15:24:55] Nik: lotus ground effect, i had a fan on my back too

[2023-09-05T15:25:39] Nik: have fun
[2023-09-05T15:26:34] Nik: sadly you can't do it in that place, cause the end starting from the "good side" is pretty rough, trees fucked up the concrete
[2023-09-05T15:27:10] Nik: it's an abandoned track, we're lucky we can access it from time to time
[2023-09-05T15:27:16] Nik: i love it üòÇ
[2023-09-05T15:27:24] rosheee: XD but not.monza
[2023-09-05T15:27:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes I'm trying to tune, but don't understand üòÇ what are your settings ?
[2023-09-05T15:27:39] Nik: that's the old Monza... jesus christ you're stubborn

[2023-09-05T15:28:52] rosheee: Lol
[2023-09-05T15:28:53] Nik: old closed Monza section, parabolic one, closed cause it was too dangerous
[2023-09-05T15:29:03] Face de Pin Suc√©: Oh okay x)
[2023-09-05T15:29:03] rosheee: Put 2v start omh
[2023-09-05T15:29:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: 2V start and 0ERPM ?
[2023-09-05T15:29:27] Nik: u been there but u didnt visit the old track, it's a free park! sad man u missed out should have brought a scooter to go brr

[2023-09-05T15:33:51] puneDir: My pro2 was faster than ami
[2023-09-05T17:14:13] Nik: what do you suggest?
[2023-09-05T17:15:00] Nik: some friends suggested me Votols, but that's not vesc, and they're big, and use old software, so old i'd probably need a windows 7 instance installed somewhere
[2023-09-05T17:15:37] Nik: anyone using them here? they been doing good?
[2023-09-05T17:16:07] Nik: I know but I could get 150GTs for cheap üòÇ
[2023-09-05T17:16:35] Nik: that's good, I'll scroll up and search around
[2023-09-05T17:16:41] Nik: I'll watch
[2023-09-05T17:17:31] Nik: oh I've seen rage mechanics, actual dope stuff
[2023-09-05T17:17:50] Nik: will for sure ask, thanks a lot ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2023-09-05T17:22:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: Thank you üòå
[2023-09-05T17:26:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: If you need, I have 2 C350 in stock üòÅ
[2023-09-05T17:27:16] Nik: :o, what's the price for those?
[2023-09-05T17:27:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: 399‚Ç¨ VAT Included
[2023-09-05T17:28:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: Up to 200A battery, 400A phase
[2023-09-05T17:28:44] Nik: 399 each or both? üòÅ
[2023-09-05T17:28:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: Each üòÅüòã
[2023-09-05T17:29:10] Nik: okok, I'll let you know üòÅ
[2023-09-05T17:30:05] Unknown: Im searching cannot find one person who did Cl350 on ebike, no videos, no posts, is this new controller ?
[2023-09-05T17:30:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: Cl350 is made for escooter specially, you have to see cl700 for bike
[2023-09-05T17:31:45] Unknown: But why for me is enough 200/400 bat/phase and i dont need big brick , for that i can get Asi/Nucular ‚Ä¶
[2023-09-05T17:33:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is different 200A batt of e-bike than 200A of escooter, high load motor will require more continuous power , specially if used as dirt bike
[2023-09-05T17:33:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: We did with C350 long time ago, we will do again on a Surron for testings
[2023-09-05T17:34:00] Face de Pin Suc√©: Just didn't have time yet
[2023-09-05T17:34:12] Face de Pin Suc√©: But will perform really well if you add heatsink to it
[2023-09-05T17:35:37] Unknown: No space for that ‚Ä¶ so you dont know how that controller behave on lets say qs205 motor and 200+amp battery ?
[2023-09-05T17:36:10] Unknown: You understand it is risky to buy it without someone tested it ‚Ä¶
[2023-09-05T17:36:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: What do you mean no place for that ? What place do you have ?
[2023-09-05T17:36:38] Face de Pin Suc√©: Nope I don't, because I don't have QS205
[2023-09-05T17:37:32] Unknown: Max 48mm height in that controller box space
[2023-09-05T17:38:22] Unknown: I think with heatsink it will be more
[2023-09-05T17:38:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: I don't know any controller that could fit inside it without airflow and could sustain 200A battery But have you got more pictures of this box ?
[2023-09-05T17:39:32] Unknown: Kelly is now on 170 amps peak no overheating , no problem ..
[2023-09-05T17:39:55] Unknown: It is controller cover that screws on frame
[2023-09-05T17:40:19] Face de Pin Suc√©: Which Kelly ?
[2023-09-05T17:40:35] Unknown: It has airflow on sides and heat goes to metal plate that is screwed on frame , aluminium one
[2023-09-05T17:40:42] Unknown: 7230s
[2023-09-05T17:40:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: You will be surprised, but 12 fet to220 does it no problem.
[2023-09-05T17:41:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: But otherwise, flipsky does it as well , not reliable but it does
[2023-09-05T17:41:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: It always need a airflow, but maybe I didn't understand well how it is placed
[2023-09-05T17:42:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: Like 3shul, without airflow even with it you can‚Äôt do
[2023-09-05T17:42:41] Face de Pin Suc√©: Can't do what ?
[2023-09-05T17:43:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: I wanna see 200A battery for the whole day without external cooling
[2023-09-05T17:44:14] Face de Pin Suc√©: If not putted on heatsink with airflow, impossible
[2023-09-05T17:44:23] Face de Pin Suc√©: Neither a 30mos kelly 7230
[2023-09-05T17:44:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: So yes, that I mean
[2023-09-05T17:45:17] Luis Magalhaes: But this box have some air flow, i can see the controller inside
[2023-09-05T17:45:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: Or, I just don‚Äôt get your message
[2023-09-05T17:45:18] Face de Pin Suc√©: Okay yes
[2023-09-05T17:45:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because any esc need cooling
[2023-09-05T17:45:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: If is semiconductor based
[2023-09-05T17:45:46] Unknown: Yes
[2023-09-05T17:45:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: Anyway, his build isn't capable of 200A continuous
[2023-09-05T17:46:24] Unknown: <video_file>
[2023-09-05T17:46:24] Face de Pin Suc√©: If he bolts a C/CL350 to the frame and have airflow, it will sustain the heating
[2023-09-05T17:46:58] Unknown: No 200 amps peak is what i need , cintinius max 90 amps is neded ‚Ä¶
[2023-09-05T17:47:07] Face de Pin Suc√©: Okay üëç
[2023-09-05T17:55:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: very nice to watch
[2023-09-05T21:25:33] Happy Giraffe: https://www.miromax.lt/en/m-6/c-28/c-148/product-854-high_power_prismatic_lifepo4_cells_32v_25ah_80wh#specification
[2023-09-05T21:25:56] Happy Giraffe: Anyone used high power lifepos? Theres also 60Ah version with more current
[2023-09-05T21:47:44] Qhis: Is there somewhere good instructions to make a bms setup right to Ant bms?
[2023-09-05T21:57:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: 5C if nominal is very good, normally are 1C
[2023-09-05T22:10:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes but how much drop üòÇ lifepo don‚Äôt drop , and still 3000-6000 cycles at 1C discharge. Li ion does 500 max 1000 cycles at 1C
[2023-09-05T22:10:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: Don‚Äôt talking about safety, lifepo is much better
[2023-09-05T22:11:02] Happy Giraffe: 180A continuousüòÇ
[2023-09-05T22:14:21] Happy Giraffe: Lifepo could be nice on daily commuter ebike
[2023-09-05T22:15:02] Happy Giraffe: Im soon making battery/esc/electronics box inside frame triangle and it will be spaciousüòÅ
[2023-09-05T22:17:55] Happy Giraffe: Sent inquiry about 16 cells costüòÅ
[2023-09-05T22:18:03] Happy Giraffe: I check them out
[2023-09-05T22:18:21] Happy Giraffe: For casual bike I need 60A max, Mxus cant take more lol
[2023-09-05T22:18:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: The problem of lifepo is the low voltage, and big + heavier
[2023-09-05T22:19:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: But for storage the best
[2023-09-05T22:20:36] Happy Giraffe: Im trying to get the 6t and 4t stators for freeüòÇ
[2023-09-05T22:20:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: To be honest I never used lifepo4 , only for storage 320ah Catl prismatic cell
[2023-09-05T22:21:28] Happy Giraffe: Price is also a factor haha, compared to LG M50LT etc
[2023-09-05T22:22:11] Happy Giraffe: I think 60A about the right battery current. Ofc temp sensor tells the truth
[2023-09-05T22:23:14] Unknown: I did 100 no problem , it was not heating at all
[2023-09-05T22:25:11] Happy Giraffe: Which winding?
[2023-09-05T22:25:45] Happy Giraffe: I might get the 3shul early...or alu spintend from youüòÅ
[2023-09-05T22:25:58] Unknown: 4t it was 2 years ago
[2023-09-05T22:26:01] Unknown: https://youtu.be/vtTx7p2O37c?si=YBMyZ0-v08PDgfxk
[2023-09-05T22:26:14] Happy Giraffe: And you had temperature sensor in?
[2023-09-05T22:26:54] Unknown: Yes but it was not heating i did hill 1000 meters without cut , but it was winter üòÇ
[2023-09-05T22:27:31] Happy Giraffe: Yeah summer another story, but I'm interested in measured values under normal riding
[2023-09-05T22:27:55] Happy Giraffe: Typically nobody is able to show that making it most valuable info everüòÅ
[2023-09-05T22:28:20] Unknown: I think no problem for normal riding
[2023-09-05T22:29:28] Happy Giraffe: Some say it cant take much...lmao Im gonna slap one gear to my bike that lets me pedal 35-40kmh and then torque sensor sending me to outer spaceüòÅ
[2023-09-05T22:30:24] Happy Giraffe: So max speed must be tops ~40üòÅ then maybe getting 16s batt later
[2023-09-05T22:30:27] Unknown: But after mxus qs205 5t was rocket
[2023-09-05T22:30:49] Happy Giraffe: Yeah that won't fit on normal bicycle frameüòÅ
[2023-09-05T22:31:07] Unknown: Mine was like 56km/h 60v but 24inch tyres
[2023-09-05T22:31:14] Happy Giraffe: A lot stronger
[2023-09-05T22:31:22] Unknown: True
[2023-09-05T22:31:43] Unknown: Yes beast torque
[2023-09-05T22:31:43] Happy Giraffe: QS phase cable alone is 10mm2üòÇ
[2023-09-05T22:31:54] Unknown: Yep
[2023-09-05T22:33:36] Simone: Goodbye üò¢

[2023-09-05T22:33:41] Unknown: Last week we did hill climb 12km my friend with Nami , he was not able to keep with qs üòÇ
[2023-09-05T22:33:48] Unknown: https://youtu.be/MbPBoebDVFo?si=3Zw5zfaJXW_uYxuG
[2023-09-05T22:34:06] Unknown: Raw power üòÇ
[2023-09-05T22:37:23] Happy Giraffe: Now that I delay my next bike, will be all out 20kw Lightning Rods monster. That smokes even qs273 like nothingüòÅ
[2023-09-05T22:37:47] Happy Giraffe: On 10kw it does like 5sec 0-80kmhüòÅ
[2023-09-05T22:38:21] Unknown: Yep
[2023-09-05T22:41:47] Happy Giraffe: QS needed to make their 45mm stator motor for 135mm dropout grrr
[2023-09-05T22:43:05] Happy Giraffe: They have from rated 6kw to 12-15kw. But those are way too careful values. A finnish guy will install one next week so hopefully we get some input on that. They are generally less powerfull than 138 70H
[2023-09-05T22:43:48] Happy Giraffe: Yeah will see, if they eat 250A batt 400A phase then QS is in troubleüòú
[2023-09-05T22:44:29] Happy Giraffe: Also I wanna have one realistic dyno test on that. Its stupid nobody test rear wheel power as its all that matters
[2023-09-05T22:44:43] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-09-05T22:45:54] Happy Giraffe: Haha, finnish guy had the custom wired 273 that would have smoked a tesla 3 performance but he couldnt keep front wheel on ground
[2023-09-05T22:46:11] Mirono escooters: Lead in front üò≥
[2023-09-05T22:46:39] Mirono escooters: Longer swingarms üò≥
[2023-09-05T22:46:54] Happy Giraffe: But mid drives are crazy, cant wait to test later...very much later propably samsung released 60S to be crap aswell
[2023-09-05T22:47:44] Happy Giraffe: How can 20kw become magically 60kw?
[2023-09-05T22:48:04] Happy Giraffe: Guy calculated phase amps x max voltage?
[2023-09-05T22:48:17] Mirono escooters: 800 line amps, phase amps Ig
[2023-09-05T22:48:53] Happy Giraffe: Then why put 20üåö
[2023-09-05T22:48:54] Mirono escooters: Tf
[2023-09-05T22:48:58] Happy Giraffe: Lmao
[2023-09-05T22:49:34] Mirono escooters: Long time to saturate em
[2023-09-05T22:49:47] Happy Giraffe: I salute the esc for keeping track of the motor
[2023-09-05T22:50:43] Happy Giraffe: But he hasnt done test video, so pics or it didnt happen
[2023-09-05T22:50:58] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-09-05T22:52:51] Mirono escooters: Ahahahahahz
[2023-09-05T22:52:55] Mirono escooters: Yah, he needs bigger frame
[2023-09-05T22:54:11] Happy Giraffe: I think grip also might become an issue
[2023-09-05T22:54:35] Happy Giraffe: Our guy used bearebike frame with 273 and almost got same results
[2023-09-05T22:57:19] Happy Giraffe: https://youtu.be/raJ3IgO1DlY?si=d5ZIzBb127mMKwO6 06:05
[2023-09-05T22:57:31] Happy Giraffe: Not that much but for 273 not bad
[2023-09-05T22:59:55] Happy Giraffe: Theoretical 2.7s 0-100kmh if he had front on roadüòÇ was dynoed
[2023-09-05T23:02:16] Unknown: My friend did motor qs238 small motor, Asi 8000 , 30 kw it is madness

[2023-09-05T23:13:01] Unknown: Yes they did not good job .
[2023-09-05T23:14:15] Unknown: Yes but i see Surron users buy them alot.. and some company as Bearebike from Poland use them In all bikes

[2023-09-05T23:21:24] Unknown: Only think i dont understand why vesc controlers dont have wire harness ‚Ä¶ conectorss, maybe im wrong ‚Ä¶ it is just from looking options what vesc to get

[2023-09-06T11:52:37] Happy Giraffe: Is there a better alternative in Europe?
[2023-09-06T13:23:43] Gabe Enzo: nkon.nl is the only place you should be buying cells.
[2023-09-06T13:23:57] Mirono escooters: They got LifePo4 too
[2023-09-06T13:23:59] Gabe Enzo: Those cells are outdated.
[2023-09-06T13:24:08] Gabe Enzo: only 3.2v nominal and low energy dense due to that fact.
[2023-09-06T13:24:14] Gabe Enzo: useless.
[2023-09-06T13:24:28] Gabe Enzo: 18650 better and even more and more people are using 21700 these days
[2023-09-06T13:25:14] Gabe Enzo: > 80wh for 32‚Ç¨ 18650 cells 11-14wh for 2‚Ç¨ a pop. 200% more energy dense per the ‚Ç¨
[2023-09-06T13:26:43] Mirono escooters: LifePo4 isn't useless bro
[2023-09-06T13:26:52] Mirono escooters: Very safe. I use for powerwall
[2023-09-06T13:26:59] Mirono escooters: And on bikes it's more and more common. Tesla too.
[2023-09-06T13:27:08] Gabe Enzo: I was about to mention it's only good for power walls
[2023-09-06T13:27:16] Gabe Enzo: Y
[2023-09-06T13:27:19] Mirono escooters: And for my boat project. And my cart

[2023-09-06T13:27:49] Gabe Enzo: what's the HP?
[2023-09-06T13:27:56] Mirono escooters: Very low. Tis for a kid
[2023-09-06T13:28:02] Mirono escooters: Hence the safety
[2023-09-06T13:28:25] Gabe Enzo: I was thinking lead acid is safer but it indeed expumes neurotoxic sulfur fumes.
[2023-09-06T13:28:35] Mirono escooters: Sealed lead acid
[2023-09-06T13:28:46] Mirono escooters: Lead acid is outdated. Replaced with LifePo4 in newer cars (another good point of it)

[2023-09-06T14:01:44] Gabe Enzo: I suppose it's long term investment after all.
[2023-09-06T14:32:19] Happy Giraffe: I mean it aint cheap anyway. All sold out
[2023-09-06T14:32:41] Happy Giraffe: Decent 30Ah cells seem to be in demand

[2023-09-06T19:07:12] Happy Giraffe: Is there any specific reason you want beta so much?
[2023-09-06T19:07:49] Jedich Nixan: Don't need to downgrade my Ninebot BLE to Xiaomi Version
[2023-09-06T19:08:03] Happy Giraffe: Oh

[2023-09-06T22:28:22] Happy Giraffe: You should, saves brakes and gives you some energy backüòÅ
[2023-09-06T22:31:50] Mirko Boni: But my arms are not good for regeneration
[2023-09-06T22:48:52] Happy Giraffe: Grrr can you change the order?
[2023-09-06T22:50:46] Jan: You need less tire pressure and 60¬∞C hot pmt tires
[2023-09-06T22:51:06] Jan: Then 10-12kW per wheel is alright

[2023-09-06T23:13:46] Happy Giraffe: Our guy had a rim with spokes like this...
[2023-09-06T23:14:31] Mirono escooters: Mm and?
[2023-09-06T23:17:33] Happy Giraffe: Bends like the knee of Jon Snow
[2023-09-06T23:19:03] Happy Giraffe: It's single crossed the easiest lacing pattern
[2023-09-06T23:33:39] Mirko Boni: I didn't have the Poles do the work.. I ordered everything and had it built at my trusted shop.. Tomorrow I'll go to pick up the rim with the engine
[2023-09-07T06:10:09] Happy Giraffe: Maybe I should have done the same but its kind of awkward to take a motor from overseas and then lace in home city store that also sells same motorüòÇ

[2023-09-07T12:28:10] Happy Giraffe: I will use 8-10ml on the mxus, its rather large motor. I will see when applying
[2023-09-07T12:28:29] Happy Giraffe: Lol, make beefy torque arms...
[2023-09-07T12:29:15] Unknown: I did 8ml on qs205 it was more then enough
[2023-09-07T12:30:56] Happy Giraffe: Then maybe 6-8 for mxus
[2023-09-07T12:31:15] Mirono escooters: Qs273 took the whole 15ml

[2023-09-07T13:30:32] Mirko Boni: What engine is this?
[2023-09-07T13:51:12] Simone: I've seen a Super73 RX with the same engine and it didn't use any stiffeners
[2023-09-07T13:59:51] Mirko Boni: Because the super 73 frame is already designed for electric motors. My mtb needs torque arms instead
[2023-09-07T14:21:41] Happy Giraffe: Pls share pics, you realise a full power qs273 is like a 500cc motorbike lol

[2023-09-07T15:40:05] Luis Magalhaes: You have a manual in spintend site if you need to check somethings
[2023-09-07T15:43:04] Gabe Enzo: what should I get instead? would it be too expensive?
[2023-09-07T15:43:42] Gabe Enzo: X tech has those blocks to mount on the pro 2
[2023-09-07T15:43:51] Gabe Enzo: do I need those blocks
[2023-09-07T15:43:57] Gabe Enzo: Interesting
[2023-09-07T15:44:15] Gabe Enzo: I'll ask someone

[2023-09-07T15:47:54] Gabe Enzo: this shit?
[2023-09-07T15:51:44] Eric Howat: Thanks so much!
[2023-09-07T15:52:06] Eric Howat: By the shamano kit off AliExpress it wasn‚Äôt very expensive
[2023-09-07T15:55:42] Eric Howat: One last question, can I run a USB cord for phone charging off the VESC 12 volt port? (ubox V2 75v100a)
[2023-09-07T15:57:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: If you need something with brake line, use Shimano BR-M 375, otherwise hydraulic get Shimano MT200
[2023-09-07T16:01:11] KierreKikkeli: is it ok if i just slap the spintend 80v alubox into the 1 battery hole with 1 screw?
[2023-09-07T16:01:30] KierreKikkeli: want to slap motor into the back but the wires were cut very short by the previous owner
[2023-09-07T16:02:55] KierreKikkeli: vesc too short
[2023-09-07T16:03:02] KierreKikkeli: by like 0,2cm
[2023-09-07T16:04:05] KierreKikkeli: and how do i attach the vesc itself?
[2023-09-07T16:04:13] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9581@07-09-2023_16-04-13.jpg>
[2023-09-07T16:04:17] KierreKikkeli: holes here

[2023-09-07T16:05:10] KierreKikkeli: 4 for case 4 for the pcb
[2023-09-07T16:05:58] KierreKikkeli: they are for the pcb yes
[2023-09-07T16:06:12] KierreKikkeli: nvm they arent im dumb
[2023-09-07T16:10:08] KierreKikkeli: Guess ill need to drill the holes through the case
[2023-09-07T16:10:17] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9584@07-09-2023_16-10-17.jpg>
[2023-09-07T16:13:03] KierreKikkeli: drill it bigger with 3mm and slap screws in?
[2023-09-07T16:45:06] KierreKikkeli: fuck, need to go to the store to get shorter screws
[2023-09-07T16:46:30] KierreKikkeli: also need the scoot for it
[2023-09-07T16:46:36] KierreKikkeli: <animation>

[2023-09-07T16:52:24] Oreo huzky: Why that
[2023-09-07T16:54:22] Mirono escooters: At least 4 piston xd
[2023-09-07T16:54:37] Mirono escooters: I swear with kotto but that's 3mm and 180mm disks..ü§∑
[2023-09-07T16:54:40] Mirono escooters: For bike
[2023-09-07T17:40:56] sombre_enfant: How i should set my limit on vesc to avoid death of the vesc when powercut
[2023-09-07T17:44:52] KierreKikkeli: M4's it is xd
[2023-09-07T18:11:10] Mirono escooters: Your cutoff v limits above BMS cut limits
[2023-09-07T18:17:51] sombre_enfant: How much above ?
[2023-09-07T18:24:03] Mirono escooters: A few v
[2023-09-07T18:24:42] KierreKikkeli: wait, the fucking case needs to be screwed close from the backside thats on the scoot now.....
[2023-09-07T18:25:01] KierreKikkeli: so i need to drill holes through the standing board??? xd
[2023-09-07T18:36:39] KierreKikkeli: As in
[2023-09-07T18:36:44] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9587@07-09-2023_18-36-44.jpg>
[2023-09-07T18:38:42] KierreKikkeli: ??
[2023-09-07T18:42:36] Mirono escooters: Design and print a clamp
[2023-09-07T18:44:44] KierreKikkeli: no printer no fusion experience xd
[2023-09-07T18:45:22] KierreKikkeli: best idea i have is to use a nail board and attach vesc into that and the nailboard into the battery holes
[2023-09-07T18:47:37] Mirono escooters: Oh boy
[2023-09-07T18:48:01] KierreKikkeli: other one is to drill holes through the deck and attach it that way'
[2023-09-07T18:48:12] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-09-07T18:48:21] KierreKikkeli: mood
[2023-09-07T18:49:35] KierreKikkeli: Or drill holes to the end of the top piece, attach a nailboard on top of the case, use that for attaching? ü§î
[2023-09-07T18:51:06] KierreKikkeli: As in?
[2023-09-07T18:51:15] Mirono escooters: :(
[2023-09-07T18:53:16] KierreKikkeli: Or just do dis
[2023-09-07T18:54:31] KierreKikkeli: indeed
[2023-09-07T18:54:46] KierreKikkeli: thats what u get for selling e scoot vesc's that are bottom mounted XD
[2023-09-07T18:55:38] Mirono escooters: No, most do it properly üò≠
[2023-09-07T18:57:44] KierreKikkeli: wdym properly, make a 3d printed clamp?
[2023-09-07T18:58:01] Mirono escooters: Or a good clamp
[2023-09-07T18:58:04] Mirono escooters: Or idk, but not dat
[2023-09-07T18:58:24] KierreKikkeli: imma god damn hot glue it next xd
[2023-09-07T18:58:58] Pablo Fernandez: Keep It on the hand while riding. Easy install
[2023-09-07T18:59:51] KierreKikkeli: slap it on the wheel, self cooling solution

[2023-09-07T19:09:12] –°–∞—à–∞ –§–æ–º–∏–Ω(–ú—ã—Ç–∏—â–∏): No. I need exactly the name of the connectors
[2023-09-07T19:16:46] Happy Giraffe: This, our teacher got a 10cm long burn on his hand from fresh welded aluüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-09-07T19:17:48] Gabe Enzo: Those screw holes die after like 12 rebuilds
[2023-09-07T19:18:08] Gabe Enzo: drill all to 3.5mm or 4mm first.
[2023-09-07T19:18:13] Gabe Enzo: M3.5
[2023-09-07T19:18:18] Gabe Enzo: Then make the frame for that size.
[2023-09-07T19:18:31] Gabe Enzo: Yeah I've been thinking about it for a week now.
[2023-09-07T19:18:45] Gabe Enzo: Just where to get metal sheets from?
[2023-09-07T19:19:05] KierreKikkeli: They are m4 by default
[2023-09-07T19:19:09] Gabe Enzo: M3.
[2023-09-07T19:20:10] KierreKikkeli: M4
[2023-09-07T19:20:29] Gabe Enzo: Ohhh i thought you meant this:
[2023-09-07T19:20:39] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_9594@07-09-2023_19-20-39.jpg>
[2023-09-07T19:21:00] KierreKikkeli: Ah yea no, havent had any issues with those so far
[2023-09-07T19:21:13] Gabe Enzo: Good idea I'm gonna do what you're doing
[2023-09-07T19:21:23] Gabe Enzo: im always worried about batteries falling out
[2023-09-07T19:22:02] Gabe Enzo: Haha
[2023-09-07T19:22:22] KierreKikkeli: Just keep in mind the battery holes and the vesc holes are a pain to position, imma slap the sheet with 3 screws on the hull
[2023-09-07T19:22:37] KierreKikkeli: assuming u have a ubox xd
[2023-09-07T19:25:00] Gabe Enzo: how do you plan to bolt the battery on?
[2023-09-07T19:25:21] Gabe Enzo: heatshrink an Alu Pad on one side and then fit accordingly?
[2023-09-07T19:25:26] KierreKikkeli: new holes and or external
[2023-09-07T19:25:38] KierreKikkeli: the vescs going to the back
[2023-09-07T19:25:42] KierreKikkeli: for rwd
[2023-09-07T19:25:50] Gabe Enzo: Will the battery stress the bottom?
[2023-09-07T19:25:54] Gabe Enzo: otherwise why use this mod at all
[2023-09-07T19:26:16] KierreKikkeli: im slapping a vsett 10+ 1400w on the rear with the alubox
[2023-09-07T19:26:28] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_9596@07-09-2023_19-26-28.jpg>
[2023-09-07T19:26:31] KierreKikkeli: and use it with my 12s external for now
[2023-09-07T19:26:31] Gabe Enzo: Ah so you're only doing this for heat, not to secure batt
[2023-09-07T19:26:49] sombre_enfant: 100A 200Pa
[2023-09-07T19:26:50] KierreKikkeli: yes XD
[2023-09-07T19:27:14] KierreKikkeli: wat
[2023-09-07T19:27:31] sombre_enfant: Amps setting for the vsett motor
[2023-09-07T19:27:33] Gabe Enzo: im taking your idea and bolting my cells onto it. so no paranoia about cells escaping
[2023-09-07T19:27:35] –°–∞—à–∞ –§–æ–º–∏–Ω(–ú—ã—Ç–∏—â–∏): Can I have a link?
[2023-09-07T19:27:55] Mirono escooters: Jst gh1.25
[2023-09-07T19:28:03] KierreKikkeli: i have a 100A alubox xd
[2023-09-07T19:28:09] Mirono escooters: https://a.aliexpress.com/_m0VaCOW
[2023-09-07T19:28:19] KierreKikkeli: with 20A 12s, worked a ok in air when i tested
[2023-09-07T19:29:06] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9597@07-09-2023_19-29-06.jpg>
[2023-09-07T19:29:49] KierreKikkeli: i just need it to go max 50kmh which is well under the stock speed for the thing, but the torque will come very handy where i live, especially on winters, someday when i can afford it i'll buy a 14 or 15s prob external and later on a smaller one for internal

[2023-09-07T19:40:28] Jan: Yes
[2023-09-07T19:40:39] Jan: and...
[2023-09-07T19:40:42] Mirono escooters: Facebook is a joke
[2023-09-07T19:40:45] Pablo Fernandez: Facebook is a downgrade of reddit
[2023-09-07T19:40:58] Jan: He owns this
[2023-09-07T19:41:04] Mirono escooters: AHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
[2023-09-07T19:41:24] Pablo Fernandez: Rion should sue him
[2023-09-07T19:41:26] Mirono escooters: I dont understand why ppl want a scooter w seat üíÄüíÄ
[2023-09-07T19:41:34] Mirono escooters: Get a moped for fucks sake
[2023-09-07T19:42:41] Happy Giraffe: Oh no please no
[2023-09-07T19:42:54] Mirono escooters: ü§∑ comment alot= expert
[2023-09-07T19:43:27] Pablo Fernandez: There is no way around that
[2023-09-07T19:43:39] Happy Giraffe: Running fans on controllers, how about 150kmh direct airflow?üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-09-07T19:43:41] Pablo Fernandez: Like moped are even cheaper
[2023-09-07T19:44:22] Jan: yes this XD
[2023-09-07T19:44:32] Pablo Fernandez: Got a Guy riding this in my city
[2023-09-07T19:44:41] Pablo Fernandez: Well havent seen him in a while maybe exploded
[2023-09-07T19:44:49] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2023-09-07T19:46:31] KierreKikkeli: damn, cant get the sheet metal today :c
[2023-09-07T19:46:46] KierreKikkeli: guess its nailboards for now and lets see how much heat the vesc takes xd
[2023-09-07T19:48:50] Happy Giraffe: They sell ready made metal bottom plates
[2023-09-07T19:49:09] Mirono escooters: Yah. Use that and bolt
[2023-09-07T19:49:29] Mirono escooters: The ones they sell isn't alu but stainless steel. Heat thermals worse, but problably fine for ur power
[2023-09-07T19:50:04] Happy Giraffe: Yeah its still better than scooter body I think atleast theres airflow next to it
[2023-09-07T19:58:35] KierreKikkeli: Gonna use that prob stainless
[2023-09-07T19:58:51] Happy Giraffe: Just order a proper one
[2023-09-07T19:58:56] Happy Giraffe: Prolly like 10‚Ç¨
[2023-09-07T20:01:31] KierreKikkeli: from where and what, with correct holes and all?
[2023-09-07T20:01:59] KierreKikkeli: also i have like 2‚Ç¨ for the month xdf
[2023-09-07T20:04:16] KierreKikkeli: wont work
[2023-09-07T20:05:24] KierreKikkeli: thats the plan
[2023-09-07T20:05:48] KierreKikkeli: without thermal pad for now, but theres a thermal pad on the alu pcb and the case
[2023-09-07T20:06:01] KierreKikkeli: gonna use it for single rear drive
[2023-09-07T20:06:09] KierreKikkeli: under powered
[2023-09-07T20:06:18] KierreKikkeli: i do have a little bit of that
[2023-09-07T20:06:39] KierreKikkeli: if it didnt over heat on a chair i doubt it will on the frame
[2023-09-07T20:07:56] KierreKikkeli: sounds like a plan, pc thermal paste under the vesc case, and a simple nail bracket on top
[2023-09-07T20:11:03] KierreKikkeli: Something like this, add a new hole to the hull for one end, and drill holes for motor cables
[2023-09-07T20:12:33] KierreKikkeli: a bit off center coz connectors but oh well
[2023-09-07T20:15:38] KierreKikkeli: no tools for connectors on the other side
[2023-09-07T20:16:06] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9604@07-09-2023_20-16-06.jpg>
[2023-09-07T20:16:16] KierreKikkeli: XDDDDDD
[2023-09-07T20:16:44] KierreKikkeli: at that point im pretty sure if i cut 70% off the bracket its as good as useless
[2023-09-07T20:17:52] KierreKikkeli: also plan to use atleast 1 battery hole
[2023-09-07T20:19:01] KierreKikkeli: More like this
[2023-09-07T20:19:10] KierreKikkeli: if centered
[2023-09-07T20:19:58] KierreKikkeli: But why not diagonal ü§î
[2023-09-07T20:21:26] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9607@07-09-2023_20-21-26.jpg>
[2023-09-07T20:23:54] KierreKikkeli: This way i just need to drill and tap the battery holes to m6 so it will stay and to drill the cable holes
[2023-09-07T20:27:36] KierreKikkeli: Is it better for the chip to be covered too or no?
[2023-09-07T20:28:19] KierreKikkeli: Alrait so ill drill a hole for that too, thanks
[2023-09-07T21:36:04] KierreKikkeli: The longer one was impossible to drill so i had to use a smoll one -.-
[2023-09-07T21:38:57] KierreKikkeli: yeah, just gonna file the edges
[2023-09-07T21:54:24] KierreKikkeli: Forgor that i own the hole widener bit xd

[2023-09-07T22:12:29] KierreKikkeli: Sanded and filed result
[2023-09-07T22:13:08] KierreKikkeli: Was i supposed to sand this vesc enclosure aswell for better thermal conduct?
[2023-09-07T22:13:28] KierreKikkeli: Thanks xd
[2023-09-07T22:22:51] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9615@07-09-2023_22-22-51.jpg>
[2023-09-07T22:24:28] Happy Giraffe: I bet you dont have to thermally even connect it yet
[2023-09-07T22:25:06] Mirono escooters: xD tru
[2023-09-07T22:25:16] Happy Giraffe: Your battery cant stress vesc enough so just mount it to prevent rattling loose and breaking
[2023-09-07T22:26:36] Happy Giraffe: Ordered torque wrench. Time to step up my assembly game
[2023-09-07T22:35:24] KierreKikkeli: uuu pog and fair xd
[2023-09-07T22:36:09] KierreKikkeli: next time i need to do something like this project i swear im gonna drag the whole thing to you XDDDDD
[2023-09-07T22:36:44] KierreKikkeli: all tho doubt theres anything this scale to mod anymore
[2023-09-07T22:42:20] Happy Giraffe: I will escape to Poland if you doüòÇ
[2023-09-07T22:47:33] Mirono escooters: What's.. that middle one?
[2023-09-07T22:47:33] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_9616@07-09-2023_22-47-33.jpg>
[2023-09-07T22:48:23] KierreKikkeli: i have friends there, imma follow XDD
[2023-09-07T22:49:40] KierreKikkeli: Its on
[2023-09-07T22:49:48] Happy Giraffe: X doubt
[2023-09-07T22:49:53] KierreKikkeli: next up the rear wheel madness
[2023-09-07T22:50:05] Pablo Fernandez: Go to poland and get my nami from there, fucking UPS doesnt send it
[2023-09-07T22:50:25] KierreKikkeli: trust me the polish dont know where it is either XDDDD
[2023-09-07T22:57:14] KierreKikkeli: Be aware happy, my cat has your scent and i will make her track you down üòÇ
[2023-09-07T22:57:38] Happy Giraffe: Just check the cat doesnt bite your power cables lol
[2023-09-07T22:57:40] Mirono escooters: That thing takes alot of space üò®
[2023-09-07T22:57:58] Mirono escooters: Tis real
[2023-09-07T22:58:02] Mirono escooters: Watercool too
[2023-09-07T22:58:15] KierreKikkeli: shes trained, no worries there
[2023-09-07T22:58:25] KierreKikkeli: yup
[2023-09-07T22:58:25] Mirono escooters: I'll be honest, better mounting then I thought it would be
[2023-09-07T22:58:31] KierreKikkeli: XD
[2023-09-07T23:00:33] Happy Giraffe: Not bad, but in future you could add some sort of rubber layer there etc to take the hit from vibrations
[2023-09-07T23:00:56] Happy Giraffe: Might start moving slowly after some impacts
[2023-09-07T23:01:01] KierreKikkeli: <video_file>
[2023-09-07T23:01:26] KierreKikkeli: true, i have a assorted carbage collection of o rings
[2023-09-07T23:01:36] Mirono escooters: Or thermalpad. Or paste
[2023-09-07T23:01:38] KierreKikkeli: so could slap ones under and over the screws
[2023-09-07T23:01:40] Mirono escooters: Prefer pad
[2023-09-07T23:01:48] KierreKikkeli: paste works better
[2023-09-07T23:01:56] KierreKikkeli: but yea, prob gonna get a pad xd
[2023-09-07T23:01:57] Mirono escooters: Yas, but pad takes some load too
[2023-09-07T23:02:05] Mirono escooters: And you have such a big size. Pad works fine
[2023-09-07T23:02:12] KierreKikkeli: and if heat issue, slap a 4-8mm fan in there
[2023-09-07T23:02:14] Mirono escooters: Paste only small very heat component
[2023-09-07T23:02:18] Mirono escooters: Nooooooo
[2023-09-07T23:02:20] Mirono escooters: No fan
[2023-09-07T23:02:22] Mirono escooters: Or jan kick u
[2023-09-07T23:02:25] KierreKikkeli: why
[2023-09-07T23:02:35] KierreKikkeli: actually curious
[2023-09-07T23:02:42] Mirono escooters: Your scoot is a massive heatsink you cannot physically saturate
[2023-09-07T23:02:55] Mirono escooters: And a fan is just bad at cooling. Air isn't a good conductor of heat
[2023-09-07T23:03:14] Mirono escooters: You have enough aluminum and physical metal touching for frame to be enough
[2023-09-07T23:03:18] Mirono escooters: You'll see. It's pleenty
[2023-09-07T23:03:22] Mirono escooters: Even 25kw scoots dont
[2023-09-07T23:03:59] KierreKikkeli: i mean, i was thinking of slapping a fan like 2mm above the vesc to push the heat on the body like in pc's
[2023-09-07T23:04:13] Mirono escooters: No, no fins, doesn't work like that
[2023-09-07T23:04:20] KierreKikkeli: on pc side things i am an somewhat of an expert
[2023-09-07T23:04:23] Mirono escooters: I understand the thinking but it's practically useless
[2023-09-07T23:04:27] KierreKikkeli: doesnt need fins
[2023-09-07T23:04:33] KierreKikkeli: i ran my first pc without a heatsink XD
[2023-09-07T23:04:42] Mirono escooters: Massive heatsink, many fins, big heat generating component
[2023-09-07T23:04:56] Mirono escooters: You do you . But see without fan.
[2023-09-07T23:04:59] Mirono escooters: I guarantee u no need
[2023-09-07T23:05:18] KierreKikkeli: yeah i will, and prob will only face issues when i have a stronger battery
[2023-09-07T23:05:40] Mirono escooters: You wont
[2023-09-07T23:05:42] KierreKikkeli: airflow to dissipate heat more evenly would be useful i argue tho
[2023-09-07T23:05:42] Mirono escooters: Alupcb and massive frame
[2023-09-07T23:05:50] Mirono escooters: @AJAJ1992 tell him
[2023-09-07T23:05:54] KierreKikkeli: 100A alu pcb
[2023-09-07T23:05:58] Mirono escooters: God, I have this discussion so much üò≠
[2023-09-07T23:06:02] KierreKikkeli: XDDDDD
[2023-09-07T23:06:08] Mirono escooters: Bro, tis a flat vesc
[2023-09-07T23:06:11] Mirono escooters: I give up, past 11
[2023-09-07T23:06:12] KierreKikkeli: dw im just bully
[2023-09-07T23:06:19] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-09-07T23:06:31] KierreKikkeli: would need like a 250mm fan to do anything
[2023-09-07T23:06:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Why doubt?
[2023-09-07T23:06:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs even underrated for safety range
[2023-09-07T23:07:05] Jan: There is a difference between your pc and your scooter
[2023-09-07T23:07:06] Mirono escooters: Yep xd
[2023-09-07T23:07:10] Jan: Your scooter is moving
[2023-09-07T23:07:12] Mirono escooters: The Lord has arrived
[2023-09-07T23:07:48] KierreKikkeli: so what your telling me is to watercool the frame
[2023-09-07T23:07:59] Jan: No üòÖ
[2023-09-07T23:07:59] KierreKikkeli: XDDD
[2023-09-07T23:08:38] Pablo Fernandez: You can fill the whole frame with ec-110
[2023-09-07T23:08:49] KierreKikkeli: mineral oil
[2023-09-07T23:08:55] KierreKikkeli: drive it in a fish tank
[2023-09-07T23:09:03] Jan: Use the resources you have ( the moving vehicle through the air) instead of making the next "grand complications"
[2023-09-07T23:09:16] Mirono escooters: Keep simple ü•∞
[2023-09-07T23:09:56] KierreKikkeli: yes yes, i doubt anything other than slapping airgrills/fins on the body would do anything for cooling
[2023-09-07T23:13:09] Mirono escooters: https://chargedup3d.com/products/75100-pro-vesc-my1020?fbclid=IwAR2R8qMWuxTXGoVqVEA0UmHLhE1Qjkimjfhp2I8-7NCzTY7cS27QDIfteww Problably only rebranded
[2023-09-07T23:15:14] KierreKikkeli: oh yeah... fuck... need to drill a hole to the side of the body for motor wires
[2023-09-07T23:17:22] KierreKikkeli: or i guess enlarging the rear light hole would do the trick
[2023-09-07T23:17:27] Oreo huzky: I have split rim for my xiaomi 1s to mount solid 10 inch tire on the rear easier and now every time I brake the rim dosent turn and the tire spins on the rim is that bad

[2023-09-07T23:18:22] Mirono escooters: So overpriced 75100
[2023-09-07T23:18:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It is, 75100 Pro
[2023-09-07T23:18:36] Mirono escooters: Pre tuned.. isn't that.. the point.. of vesc.üòÇ That you can tune it
[2023-09-07T23:20:20] KierreKikkeli: ah thanks, also just for the fuck of it im soon gonna drill a hole to the body and actually slap the 4mm fan on it XD
[2023-09-07T23:20:50] KierreKikkeli: start scoot, "high pitched screetching from a industrial mini fan"

[2023-09-08T02:03:59] KierreKikkeli: rearwheel is m8
[2023-09-08T02:04:32] KierreKikkeli: vsett is around m15 coz m13.5 barely gets the tip in
[2023-09-08T02:05:16] KierreKikkeli: then why this bitch no go in when i tried to round the hole bigger

[2023-09-08T06:26:15] Happy Giraffe: I meant between the clamp and vesc
[2023-09-08T06:26:39] Happy Giraffe: Then a pad/paste between vesc and frame ofc
[2023-09-08T06:31:48] Happy Giraffe: Giant battery thereüòÇ

[2023-09-08T14:58:00] Finn: didnt i send you a photo
[2023-09-08T16:08:10] KierreKikkeli: nope, m4 plug doesnt just go flushly into m4 threads for it to go without threading the hole needs to be m5, same thing here
[2023-09-08T16:56:03] Eric Howat: Hey question, what size bullets are on the Ubox V2 75a100x2
[2023-09-08T17:14:41] Eric Howat: Also, can you run a usb cord off the 5v circuit to charge a phone?
[2023-09-08T18:06:11] KierreKikkeli: prob the same as with mine which is 100A 80v and had 4mm bullets if i recall correctly
[2023-09-08T18:26:38] Eric Howat: Pretty sure it‚Äôs a 4mm from the looks of it
[2023-09-08T18:26:52] Eric Howat: It‚Äôs only seeing 52v so I‚Äôm not concerned too much with resistance
[2023-09-08T18:27:26] Eric Howat: When I build a new 60v pack then I‚Äôll hard wire the phase wires to the vsec
[2023-09-08T18:30:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs 4.5, at least before with ubox 80v single
[2023-09-08T18:31:42] Eric Howat: I‚Äôll have to get the verniers calipers out üòÇ

[2023-09-08T19:50:16] Pablo Fernandez: if the scooter was like 20 cm longer
[2023-09-08T20:00:19] Eric Howat: When setting up in VESC tool for brake lights, can you use regen throttle as the brake light ‚Äúon‚Äù signal? Or do I need to be using a reed switch manual brake lever?
[2023-09-08T20:00:38] Eric Howat: I‚Äôm total newbie to this sorry if it‚Äôs a basic question

[2023-09-08T20:56:52] sombre_enfant: It will spin on itself
[2023-09-08T20:57:51] Mirono escooters: xD tru
[2023-09-08T20:57:58] Mirono escooters: It needs flat and torque washer
[2023-09-08T20:58:05] Mirono escooters: No matter how hard u tighten it
[2023-09-08T20:58:51] Mirono escooters: Maybe use these 2 + torque washer?
[2023-09-08T21:00:57] Happy Giraffe: Or we gotta make a torque arm
[2023-09-08T21:01:11] Mirono escooters: Ye
[2023-09-08T21:01:45] Mirono escooters: Stupid ah design of monoshit
[2023-09-08T21:01:48] Mirono escooters: Looks above usability
[2023-09-08T21:17:40] KierreKikkeli: as i previously said the xiaomi and monorimm default holders fit to vsett

[2023-09-08T21:21:27] Mirono escooters: Aluminium, but eh worth a shot
[2023-09-08T21:21:28] KierreKikkeli: and have threaded em to be m4
[2023-09-08T21:21:34] Mirono escooters: Make em from hardened steel :)
[2023-09-08T21:21:56] KierreKikkeli: no need, monoshit has grooves for em
[2023-09-08T21:22:01] KierreKikkeli: grooves+m4
[2023-09-08T21:22:09] KierreKikkeli: and 2 layers

[2023-09-09T02:19:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: You have do the calibration every time you switch phases

[2023-09-09T02:41:25] KierreKikkeli: bought it from happy :)
[2023-09-09T02:42:40] KierreKikkeli: big cable with 6 smaller cables inside
[2023-09-09T02:43:24] KierreKikkeli: also which brake connection am i supposed to use for the stock electric brake sensor
[2023-09-09T02:57:00] KierreKikkeli: -reading izunas xiaomi display guide to figure out how to use it. - realizing how bout i dont do that xd
[2023-09-09T03:08:15] KierreKikkeli: also can i use rita solely to charge my 12s with xt60?
[2023-09-09T03:12:22] KierreKikkeli: or is it easier to just slap an xt 60 on the charger itself
[2023-09-09T03:14:28] KierreKikkeli: Kek
[2023-09-09T03:52:55] KierreKikkeli: Ah ait so im assuming im slapping the stock brake wires on the yellow circle
[2023-09-09T04:13:48] Eric Howat: Question on battery wiring, my VE1 has this 52v18.2ah sincpower battery with two output connectors should I bridge them together after the fuses to a single xt90 or should I delete the fuses and use the Spintend XT90 fuse?

[2023-09-09T06:22:24] KierreKikkeli: <video_file>
[2023-09-09T07:42:10] KierreKikkeli: it registers in the vesc tool but after that i have no clue what to do
[2023-09-09T07:58:55] Eric Howat: What are you trying to do?
[2023-09-09T08:25:00] KierreKikkeli: get electric brake working with the sensor only
[2023-09-09T08:25:01] KierreKikkeli: front light also no work
[2023-09-09T08:38:40] KierreKikkeli: Either this or the brake lever acts as reverse throttle :(

[2023-09-09T10:47:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: So I talked to Makerbase about on how to improve the 75100 (Alu), so I thought I might share our conversation here, because quite a few interesting things I did not know yet. Also my first impression on the 60100HP is now wrong after I now know what the difference is.

[2023-09-09T10:49:47] Mirono escooters: Its a really cheap, really good vesc
[2023-09-09T10:49:50] Mirono escooters: Just a tad improvements
[2023-09-09T10:50:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: ==> happy chinese guy going to make more money thanks to your free work üòÅüòÇ
[2023-09-09T10:51:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Nah I'm more than happy if they can make better hardware
[2023-09-09T10:52:08] Jan: The classic, someone put lots of work into it and some other guy takes money and credit for it
[2023-09-09T10:52:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: I'm done trying to improve anything with chinese
[2023-09-09T10:53:29] Face de Pin Suc√©: We did work so much with motor factory to see it being sold to anyone that wants it with our improvement for example, at the same price as long as they take more than 2 pcs for example üòÇ
[2023-09-09T10:59:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I am more of the if I improve something, everyone should have it as well, guy. Makes no sense in selling a worse product, while an improved thing exist. But yes, in the actual market the factory has to keep it a secret when the customer has its own improvements or else it would be like selling the customers product to others.
[2023-09-09T11:01:57] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Also since I am from software and chinese people 24/7 steal and modify everything I do, it is little different in this case because I can use the ideas of the modifications myself to make my own product better. xd
[2023-09-09T11:02:22] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes

[2023-09-09T11:08:57] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: since the 60100HP exists

[2023-09-09T11:24:49] KierreKikkeli: apparently all my issues were caused by the limiter on tyhe adc2 -.-
[2023-09-09T11:25:19] KierreKikkeli: also how the heck do i adjust the throttle sensitivity? rn i have about 2mm of leverage between slow and full speed
[2023-09-09T11:25:34] KierreKikkeli: adjusting any of these did nothing
[2023-09-09T11:55:39] KierreKikkeli: also is there a way to make the headlight be always on without a switch, or do i need to patent some random switch into it/connect it to the power button
[2023-09-09T12:00:13] Unknown: do you have any ideas where to place the 300a kellys on a Mantis 10 kaabo?

[2023-09-09T17:11:20] Happy Giraffe: Magicshine
[2023-09-09T17:21:20] KierreKikkeli: pricy but worth it i guess
[2023-09-09T17:28:51] Happy Giraffe: Not really, you get more light on road per dollar compared to ali lights
[2023-09-09T17:34:18] KierreKikkeli: aka worth it
[2023-09-09T17:34:25] KierreKikkeli: for dark winter roads in the woods
[2023-09-09T17:35:49] KierreKikkeli: The wires are finally all done, jesus, also theres like 7 extra wires there for lights and horn + 10cm of lenght per wire for re mounting when i add the lights
[2023-09-09T17:37:11] KierreKikkeli: Best battery option would prob be like a 5-7L wildman on the mast so the weight balances out on both ends xd + the wire hell
[2023-09-09T17:37:36] Jan: Is there also a battery in that compartment that is not visible?
[2023-09-09T17:37:41] KierreKikkeli: With the battery cable i could even slap a backback battery on
[2023-09-09T17:37:49] KierreKikkeli: Hell no XD

[2023-09-09T17:38:37] KierreKikkeli: On top of the existing extra 7
[2023-09-09T17:38:40] Jan: Its sometimes so tight that i cannot fit a single extra 4mm thick cable
[2023-09-09T17:39:07] KierreKikkeli: *skill issue* XD
[2023-09-09T17:39:39] KierreKikkeli: Plenty space for around 4 more 4-6mm signal cables
[2023-09-09T17:40:06] KierreKikkeli: + charging port hole if needed
[2023-09-09T17:43:06] KierreKikkeli: Compared to my old mini itx pc with 6 hdds, 6 fans and the biggest rtx 3060 ti brick this is easy cable managment xd
[2023-09-09T17:44:44] KierreKikkeli: Literally threw my coolermaster nr200p or whatever into the closet and switched to my 15 year old tower case coz the mobo size has so many issues and all brands keep breaking

[2023-09-09T18:06:50] Happy Giraffe: If you get battery version you wont need any extra wires
[2023-09-09T18:07:47] KierreKikkeli: i want it to be responsive and moped class legal when and if i get pulled over
[2023-09-09T18:08:42] Happy Giraffe: Could then get the 50‚Ç¨ magicshine that is german traffic regulated
[2023-09-09T18:09:02] Happy Giraffe: For sure german byrocratics are fine in finland aswell lol
[2023-09-09T18:09:39] KierreKikkeli: the plates actually also are fine in both countries xd
[2023-09-09T18:10:34] KierreKikkeli: few family friends and acquaintances take a road trip there every now and then to rev up harleys on autobahn xd
[2023-09-09T18:16:15] Happy Giraffe: But you wont need a moped plate either, just a 30kmh vesc profile so cops are happy you don't fully fool them

[2023-09-09T18:33:41] puneDir: He said 50/100k resistors between gate and source will make it work
[2023-09-09T18:33:54] puneDir: Is he right? If not what should we add
[2023-09-09T18:35:06] Mirono escooters: Its mos driver issue, not mos
[2023-09-09T18:35:07] Mirono escooters: So I doubt it
[2023-09-09T18:39:04] puneDir: Cengiz abi looks surroundings and says i should make something
[2023-09-09T20:36:41] KierreKikkeli: oh ffs
[2023-09-09T20:36:49] KierreKikkeli: finally slapped everything togewther
[2023-09-09T20:37:02] KierreKikkeli: attached the dead front light case
[2023-09-09T20:37:08] KierreKikkeli: yellow ring power button :))))
[2023-09-09T20:39:09] KierreKikkeli: Why it yellooooo
[2023-09-09T20:39:33] KierreKikkeli: Bluetooth not working either
[2023-09-09T20:42:24] KierreKikkeli: tf dies yellow mean
[2023-09-09T20:45:42] KierreKikkeli: now it wont light up even
[2023-09-09T20:45:45] KierreKikkeli: :CCCCCCCC
[2023-09-09T20:46:11] KierreKikkeli: ah took a year to light up and now it red
[2023-09-09T20:57:36] KierreKikkeli: yeah i did nothing else then attach the head light case
[2023-09-09T21:01:09] KierreKikkeli: <video_file>
[2023-09-09T21:01:24] KierreKikkeli: No clue, gonna open the base...
[2023-09-09T21:16:18] KierreKikkeli: no light
[2023-09-09T21:16:49] KierreKikkeli: only ble module lights up and the vesc buzzez
[2023-09-09T21:19:19] KierreKikkeli: <video_file>
[2023-09-09T21:21:44] KierreKikkeli: <video_file>
[2023-09-09T21:25:50] KierreKikkeli: Issue prob on the adc, disconnected 1x 12v from it and plugged into vesc np buzz, connected the other one thats on the adc, buzz and ded
[2023-09-09T21:27:40] KierreKikkeli: Adc is hotglued to cardboard and cardboard is with adhesive tape on the body :)
[2023-09-09T21:30:06] KierreKikkeli: Motor current dropped from 130 something to 50
[2023-09-09T21:30:15] KierreKikkeli: Adc is only on with a comm port
[2023-09-09T21:33:26] KierreKikkeli: Rear light
[2023-09-09T21:33:28] KierreKikkeli: Was the issue
[2023-09-09T21:34:44] KierreKikkeli: Re connected it, got magic smoke :)
[2023-09-09T21:35:20] KierreKikkeli: <video_file>
[2023-09-09T21:36:36] KierreKikkeli: for now seems like only the rear lights are gone
[2023-09-09T21:37:27] KierreKikkeli: but how why what
[2023-09-09T21:37:29] KierreKikkeli: 2 wires
[2023-09-09T21:37:36] KierreKikkeli: 5v rear light getting 12v
[2023-09-09T21:40:54] KierreKikkeli: Not shorted light, double checked
[2023-09-09T21:42:05] KierreKikkeli: My guess is some random miniscule piece of something conductive on the mosfets
[2023-09-09T21:44:17] KierreKikkeli: Nope u right, shorted backlight, propably melted itself
[2023-09-09T21:55:10] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2023-09-09T22:03:04] Mirono escooters: Or use a resistor inline
[2023-09-09T22:04:58] KierreKikkeli: tfw happy sent me fuses for this exact scenario and i didnt use em :))
[2023-09-09T22:13:32] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-09-09T22:14:32] Happy Giraffe: Tho fuse might not save you from this as 12v goes brr against 5v max light
[2023-09-09T23:17:14] Happy Giraffe: Being PWM like Miro said means it cant even take stable dc volt in if I'm not mistakenüòÅ
[2023-09-09T23:17:55] Mirono escooters: It is
[2023-09-09T23:18:00] Mirono escooters: And it takes 3v
[2023-09-09T23:18:12] Mirono escooters: Pwm regulate current, tis just a led
[2023-09-09T23:18:27] Mirono escooters: Tis current controlled not v
[2023-09-09T23:18:31] Mirono escooters: It'll cook
[2023-09-09T23:18:55] Mirono escooters: Just use resistor v divider
[2023-09-09T23:19:18] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-09-09T23:19:21] Mirono escooters: But limited
[2023-09-09T23:20:16] Mirono escooters: Bwuh
[2023-09-09T23:20:27] Mirono escooters: Tis ohm law
[2023-09-09T23:20:41] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-09-09T23:20:45] Mirono escooters: Always flat
[2023-09-09T23:20:49] Mirono escooters: U got big main batt
[2023-09-09T23:20:52] Mirono escooters: Ez
[2023-09-09T23:21:42] Mirono escooters: Light w internal dcdc ü§∑
[2023-09-09T23:21:49] Mirono escooters: Tis fine
[2023-09-09T23:31:37] KierreKikkeli: 12s 20A motors taking contact with some mystery part and front tire is backwards by accident XD
[2023-09-09T23:32:01] KierreKikkeli: 38 to gps so around 45 irl, need to test the school zone speedometer someday
[2023-09-09T23:32:24] KierreKikkeli: Also pressing throttle pops a wheelie by default xd
[2023-09-09T23:35:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: Only 20AÔºü
[2023-09-09T23:39:02] Happy Giraffe: This is why I always buy a light that has integrated electronics to apply a ton of different voltagesüòÇ
[2023-09-09T23:39:43] Happy Giraffe: Yeah he has only his old external batt from m365üòÅüòÇ
[2023-09-09T23:40:38] NetworkDir: After cut-off what burn or explode? full pcb or just mosfet or .. ? and what explode after phase filter ?
[2023-09-09T23:41:01] Happy Giraffe: Just double check motor axle stays in place lol
[2023-09-09T23:41:51] NetworkDir: i mean after explode repairable or fully pcb fucked up
[2023-09-09T23:43:29] KierreKikkeli: Yup xd
[2023-09-09T23:43:59] KierreKikkeli: No worries there, more concerned about the monoshits flying off xd
[2023-09-09T23:45:17] KierreKikkeli: Battery also at like 40% or less
[2023-09-10T00:51:30] KierreKikkeli: Yea
[2023-09-10T01:01:12] Happy Giraffe: 20A batt 120A phase he has
[2023-09-10T01:01:39] Happy Giraffe: Idk if that phase is really possible with those batt currents but hey lets tryüòÇ
[2023-09-10T11:31:37] Happy Giraffe: Atm on bus, soon getting the stators. Im planning box for battery. Any input on it?üòÅ

[2023-09-10T11:36:45] Happy Giraffe: Would open from side with hinge but I wonder if I should use some removable floor inside the box floor to access the esc compartment below itü§î
[2023-09-10T12:26:26] Happy Giraffe: Yeah Im doing sort of extra roof on top to mount dc converter and then a bottom basement for vesc. Battery will be held either by some rubber mounts or just a precise shaped foam etc
[2023-09-10T12:28:57] Happy Giraffe: 2x of something like this
[2023-09-10T12:29:13] Happy Giraffe: 2x something like this
[2023-09-10T12:34:39] Happy Giraffe: Could then add orange window sealing thingys
[2023-09-10T15:38:08] Happy Giraffe: Im quite terrified to start such a project but hey, atleast I can make it again if neededüòÅ

[2023-09-10T21:09:12] KierreKikkeli: Steering very wobbly, re fitted the front tire to no help, guess its the mast coz its off center a bit
[2023-09-10T21:09:35] Jan: Freespin 91kmh i guess?
[2023-09-10T21:11:01] Happy Giraffe: Tire imbalance you easily see when freely spinning, it looks like an egg when it moves
[2023-09-10T21:13:05] Happy Giraffe: Hehe
[2023-09-10T21:14:05] KierreKikkeli: Wrong settings
[2023-09-10T21:14:11] KierreKikkeli: Yeah
[2023-09-10T21:14:27] KierreKikkeli: Dont think its imbalanced, if anything then off center xd
[2023-09-10T21:14:31] KierreKikkeli: And steering issue
[2023-09-10T21:15:19] KierreKikkeli: Or handlebar, also phone gps and speedometer reported 39kmh
[2023-09-10T21:16:04] KierreKikkeli: With a long enough straight road prob max around 42kmh
[2023-09-10T22:18:10] Happy Giraffe: Well you see that also in person, good idea is to watch the line around tire side and compare it to rim
[2023-09-10T22:19:13] KierreKikkeli: Meant that the mouting might be uneven from the suspensions
[2023-09-11T01:04:33] KierreKikkeli: Ait it works now, needed to add 2 spacers to the rear and fix the steering
[2023-09-11T01:06:10] KierreKikkeli: Also need to either cut this or lift the rear suspension/fender by a 3cm or so with a plastic thingy, im leaning towards cutting it by 3cm
[2023-09-11T01:16:35] KierreKikkeli: Or i could just hotglue some sand paper on the motor xd
[2023-09-11T01:17:16] KierreKikkeli: Tape it and run it with sandpaper on air ü§î

[2023-09-11T17:25:08] sombre_enfant: I use this for fs75100 box v2 right ??
[2023-09-11T17:27:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes
[2023-09-11T17:30:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes but C700 is smaller and has more fets, and up to 700A phase (800A absolute)
[2023-09-11T17:45:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: C700 is 24 fet no?
[2023-09-11T17:45:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: 30 fets
[2023-09-11T17:46:53] Mirono escooters: C700 do be smoller too, no?
[2023-09-11T17:46:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: Since c350 is 12, I thought 700 is 24
[2023-09-11T17:47:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Maybe it‚Äôs with old d2pack mos?
[2023-09-11T17:48:45] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes smaller than Trampa
[2023-09-11T17:48:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's toll fets
[2023-09-11T17:49:31] sombre_enfant: I got this cant do the mapping
[2023-09-11T17:49:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: Okay so it‚Äôs just under rated
[2023-09-11T17:50:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: Ya

[2023-09-11T18:02:11] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: And you are running 6.05 vesc?
[2023-09-11T18:07:25] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: every programmers answer: works for me
[2023-09-11T18:08:23] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and this type of error seems like wrong version of VESC
[2023-09-11T18:16:35] NetworkDir: What version fw good for 75100 makerbase
[2023-09-11T18:18:31] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 75_100_V2

[2023-09-11T18:25:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: also vesc tool includes them by default
[2023-09-11T18:28:40] NetworkDir: 6.02 75_100_V2 VESC_default.bin Looks fine
[2023-09-11T19:22:00] sombre_enfant: I cant change vesc id on the fly why ?
[2023-09-11T19:22:20] sombre_enfant: Yes
[2023-09-11T19:24:21] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Then you are doing something wrong.
[2023-09-11T21:38:20] Jason Nelson: Can someone tell me will my daly prevent charging if the battery is too hot?
[2023-09-11T21:38:20] Jason Nelson: My brother doesn't work so I cannot monitor the temperature
[2023-09-11T21:41:05] Mirono escooters: If it has a temp probe
[2023-09-11T21:48:20] KierreKikkeli: Motor is now noise free and goes around 43-46kmh max if given long enough ramp up time xd, still wobbly as fuck past 30kmh
[2023-09-11T21:54:15] KierreKikkeli: no clue why
[2023-09-11T21:56:19] KierreKikkeli: <video_file>
[2023-09-11T22:00:52] Happy Giraffe: You can see the wobble in firsr second of videoüòÖ
[2023-09-11T22:01:15] KierreKikkeli: ah true
[2023-09-11T22:01:17] KierreKikkeli: damn
[2023-09-11T22:01:25] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-09-11T22:01:49] KierreKikkeli: guess the tyre isnt seated properly? or the motor isnt centered?
[2023-09-11T22:02:33] Happy Giraffe: Soap water in the side of tire wall where it contacts rim. First 0.5bar pressure and check it stays even then pump another 0.5 and if ok then it will stay
[2023-09-11T22:04:15] KierreKikkeli: i mean, it kinda does look like the whole motor isnt centered?
[2023-09-11T22:05:15] KierreKikkeli: based on this
[2023-09-11T22:06:38] KierreKikkeli: time to slap the second pair of holders in for extra width :) and re seat tyre
[2023-09-11T22:06:55] KierreKikkeli: after im done with moving that is
[2023-09-11T22:09:48] Unknown: One technical question i have standard scooter display on ebike, he uses just -/+ for voltage reading and just one hall/speed wite for reading speed from controller. Did anyone know where to connect that wire to vesc ?
[2023-09-11T22:10:24] Happy Giraffe: Mid point of tyre needs to be midpoint of dropouts. Otherwise the angle is off.
[2023-09-11T22:12:12] Happy Giraffe: I'm not sure if displays are compatible, we have our own model who some of the talented and hard working maniacs have creared hereüòÅ For the speedometer, vesc gets it from pole magnet count and tire diameter so its never really used if even possible
[2023-09-11T22:13:41] Unknown: Hmm this one uses hall for reading speed just one wire
[2023-09-11T22:14:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes it works with any controllers because it only reads one hall
[2023-09-11T22:15:41] Happy Giraffe: How is this possible?üòÅ
[2023-09-11T22:15:44] Unknown: Ok that is perfect, so controller has that pin ? Or i just connect togother with sny hall wire coming from motor to controller
[2023-09-11T22:16:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: It reads the hall switching
[2023-09-11T22:16:14] Face de Pin Suc√©: You connect in parallel
[2023-09-11T22:16:21] Happy Giraffe: I mean does vesc have functionality?üò≥
[2023-09-11T22:16:33] Face de Pin Suc√©: Doesn't need to, you read from the motor
[2023-09-11T22:16:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: As long as you power the display and put a hall signal into it
[2023-09-11T22:16:57] Face de Pin Suc√©: Then you have to set up properly for the speed
[2023-09-11T22:17:14] Face de Pin Suc√©: And I don't remember how it works exactly, it needs pole pairs and something elsd
[2023-09-11T22:17:50] Happy Giraffe: Aah, then vesc actually onky gives power to hall but display does the work and hall pulses on rotationüòÇ
[2023-09-11T22:18:00] Unknown: I can tune speed on display with little screw if it is not correct
[2023-09-11T22:35:51] Jason Nelson: Bluetooth*
[2023-09-11T22:35:58] Jason Nelson: Thank you

[2023-09-12T08:33:47] Happy Giraffe: Battery will be flipped so batt and vesc connectors are nearby. Maybe mounting external charging port if I succeed in making a protective cover and fuse for the mounted XT90.
[2023-09-12T08:34:05] Happy Giraffe: 3mm alu
[2023-09-12T08:34:41] rosheee: ^^
[2023-09-12T08:35:19] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yeah, what he doesn't say is that he paied only one, he's been refunded for the only one he paied and he has to return it back, but wants to keep these to make money out of it..'
[2023-09-12T08:36:01] Jan: Lol
[2023-09-12T08:36:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: But it's a scam, potting is impossible to remove (for real, we tested here) so if someone buy these, 1000$ they won't be able to do anything with
[2023-09-12T08:38:18] rosheee: why mosfet fail? ^^
[2023-09-12T08:38:27] rosheee: 4000A?
[2023-09-12T08:38:40] Mirono escooters: Always first return, then refund
[2023-09-12T08:39:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: First unit I don't know what happened, maybe bad assembly, second unit, hackey did a mistake, setted 700A field weakening.. üòÇ
[2023-09-12T08:59:55] Happy Giraffe: Vroom
[2023-09-12T09:14:44] Mirono escooters: How much speed you want Yes
[2023-09-12T09:14:55] Mirono escooters: Expensive mistake tho. Can't imagine doing that üôà
[2023-09-12T09:15:00] Face de Pin Suc√©: üòÇ
[2023-09-12T09:15:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: He wanted to set 70, not 700A haha
[2023-09-12T09:15:52] Mirono escooters: There goes 1k+
[2023-09-12T09:15:53] rosheee: ^^' not locked?
[2023-09-12T09:16:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: I don't know if he wasn't making some tests or so with unlocked firmware
[2023-09-12T09:17:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: At least it doesn't catch fire as G300 does x)
[2023-09-12T10:20:58] JPPL: https://youtu.be/8TCF6niM0tM?si=MZeQHU9LUFm5claf
[2023-09-12T10:21:25] JPPL: It catch fire because it's Hot üòÇ good build overall
[2023-09-12T10:36:02] Mirono escooters: It's well build, it's really efficient space use
[2023-09-12T10:36:05] Mirono escooters: I love the design
[2023-09-12T11:58:19] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_9685@12-09-2023_11-58-19.jpg>
[2023-09-12T11:58:33] Happy Giraffe: Coming slowly together
[2023-09-12T12:35:32] Happy Giraffe: Next is to figure how to mount and secure battery in while removable
[2023-09-12T12:36:53] Happy Giraffe: Dont look at the welds inside, I didnt care about the looks. Watertightness was enoughüòÇ
[2023-09-12T13:03:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: When you put too high values, firmware can't trigger fast enough
[2023-09-12T13:09:33] Face de Pin Suc√©: C700/1000 are fully potted
[2023-09-12T13:10:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: Impossible to remove
[2023-09-12T13:48:23] Oreo huzky: Any updates
[2023-09-12T13:56:46] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes
[2023-09-12T14:20:57] Mirono escooters: For the price defo
[2023-09-12T14:33:25] Mirono escooters: That man had a crash. No way otherwise
[2023-09-12T14:34:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: let's hope
[2023-09-12T14:34:23] Mirono escooters: Look at it
[2023-09-12T14:34:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: but seeing this piece is not a full piece isn't very secure
[2023-09-12T14:34:37] Mirono escooters: Or my man is 300kg. Possible, american
[2023-09-12T14:34:44] Mirono escooters: Tru
[2023-09-12T14:35:01] NetworkDir: ah
[2023-09-12T14:35:08] Mirono escooters: Should be steel
[2023-09-12T14:35:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: it seems to be, no ?
[2023-09-12T14:35:50] Face de Pin Suc√©: definitely shouldn't be alu, even CNC x)
[2023-09-12T14:36:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: That's why I think it is x)
[2023-09-12T14:36:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: yeah
[2023-09-12T14:36:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: and the scooter is fucking tank super weight
[2023-09-12T14:36:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: they won't tell me they save weight haha
[2023-09-12T14:37:51] NetworkDir: Any scooter can break. How to use is very important. Factory errors and ..
[2023-09-12T14:40:03] Pablo Fernandez: That man saying kaboo double stems are safer is a joke
[2023-09-12T14:40:15] NetworkDir: Yes
[2023-09-12T14:40:36] Mirono escooters: Hence me not trusting him
[2023-09-12T14:40:41] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_9687@12-09-2023_14-40-41.jpg>
[2023-09-12T14:40:42] Mirono escooters: Biased
[2023-09-12T14:40:45] Pablo Fernandez: Ive seen dozens of wolf double stems breaking and they havent even upgraded a piece

[2023-09-12T14:42:27] NetworkDir: HYAHAHAHA
[2023-09-12T14:42:45] Pablo Fernandez: Im biased aswel but imo brands should start doing like nami and put steel on it
[2023-09-12T14:42:51] NetworkDir: "Safer"
[2023-09-12T14:43:27] Mirono escooters: Yah
[2023-09-12T14:44:08] Pablo Fernandez: Yeah but talking about a Big chunk. Kaboo upgrading pieces is like going from garbage to trash
[2023-09-12T14:45:12] Pablo Fernandez: King gt already having 3 versions and all breaking is sad
[2023-09-12T14:47:01] Pablo Fernandez: And new kaboo display is the dumbest thing for countries where speed is limited. They got a Max speed tracker.
[2023-09-12T14:47:39] Pablo Fernandez: Get stopped by police. Sir is limited. Sees screen: Max speed 80kmh
[2023-09-12T15:20:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Single stem or double stem, a steering will be always single üòÇüòÇ
[2023-09-12T15:44:47] Gabe Enzo: "dual stem game" LOOOOOOL
[2023-09-12T15:46:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: And wolf pole is weak af
[2023-09-12T15:47:05] Happy Giraffe: Im wondering how its possible tp have weak alu frames, this generic 3mm plate I do my box with is indestructible. I can stand on it easy even without one sideüòÇ
[2023-09-12T15:51:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: But motor cable inside the steering stem is shit idea, maybe better look but much less mechanical resistance
[2023-09-12T17:57:49] Unknown: Isn't there Russians that make a better stems and steering columns for the zero and dualtron? (Kugo)
[2023-09-12T18:46:24] Mirono escooters: Shouldn't have to fix their flawed Design tho
[2023-09-12T21:45:52] Unknown: Wdymbt?
[2023-09-12T23:38:01] Happy Giraffe: This all because they want to save 5‚Ç¨ and 100gram of weight
[2023-09-12T23:38:45] Happy Giraffe: Proper Alu alloy tough AF so it's a miracle the bucketheads cant figure it out
[2023-09-12T23:44:13] Pablo Fernandez: nobody will ever understand chinese factories
[2023-09-12T23:44:44] Pablo Fernandez: is like their garbage screws, they must be saving like 10 cents for every scooter and they still put the worst quality to ever exist
[2023-09-13T12:58:15] Oreo huzky: @SibClimb any updates on the package?
[2023-09-13T13:11:10] Happy Giraffe: Impressive, which vesc?
[2023-09-13T13:44:37] Gabe Enzo: 47wh/km? same cruise consumption as my pro.
[2023-09-13T13:44:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: as your pro??
[2023-09-13T13:45:09] Gabe Enzo: 20s 900wh.
[2023-09-13T13:45:25] Gabe Enzo: only about 20km range when steamrolling
[2023-09-13T13:45:27] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I'm doing 34Wh/km at going 60-70km/h (tested on 17km)

[2023-09-13T13:45:42] Gabe Enzo: 300w Xiaomi motor is extremely inefficient when heated.
[2023-09-13T13:45:44] Gabe Enzo: I've noticed.
[2023-09-13T13:45:53] Gabe Enzo: Yes I burn 50 at 70kmh
[2023-09-13T13:46:05] Gabe Enzo: I'm making dual motor now.

[2023-09-13T23:52:32] NetworkDir: what this space ?
[2023-09-13T23:52:56] NetworkDir: g30 version doesn't have this space
[2023-09-13T23:52:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: you are looking at the wrong code anyway
[2023-09-13T23:53:42] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: fucked up smth here, ill just revert it to what it was before
[2023-09-13T23:55:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @jamessoderstrom now try
[2023-09-13T23:55:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: https://github.com/m365fw/vesc_m365_dash/tree/6_05_adc already up
[2023-09-13T23:56:31] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: alright
[2023-09-13T23:57:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: lisp does not care about spaces
[2023-09-13T23:58:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: the syntax is a nightmare, you can do anything you want
[2023-09-13T23:58:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: everything is just being done within (...)
[2023-09-13T23:58:41] NetworkDir: nice better python shit
[2023-09-13T23:59:00] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: well fuck python but fuck lisp too fuck script languages
[2023-09-13T23:59:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: fuck them
[2023-09-13T23:59:17] NetworkDir: also fuck arduino lvgl
[2023-09-13T23:59:28] NetworkDir: for draw image fuck my brain
[2023-09-13T23:59:57] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: alright good
[2023-09-14T00:01:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @lBabacar
[2023-09-14T00:01:40] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: alright time to go back to bed, turned on my pc just for that
[2023-09-14T07:16:36] sombre_enfant: No
[2023-09-14T08:54:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: we found the issue
[2023-09-14T08:54:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: it was actually an issue that I did
[2023-09-14T09:03:05] Unknown: Why the acceleration is shit with the 75200alu ?
[2023-09-14T09:03:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: Hahahaha
[2023-09-14T09:06:24] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: how much motor/battery current you push?
[2023-09-14T09:13:00] Unknown: Motor 85a battery 55a
[2023-09-14T09:13:39] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: with what motor? That is not that much, did you have anything else before to compare to or why do you think it is slow in accelerstion?
[2023-09-14T09:15:06] Unknown: I had a 25a stock controller and the initial acceleration feels not that fast it's starting to accelerate after 25kmh
[2023-09-14T09:15:14] Unknown: 1200w zero10x
[2023-09-14T09:16:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes go with higher motor current, if the initial acceleration is slower. Also might try other observers, for me most of the time mxlemming got more torque (in my feeling).
[2023-09-14T09:16:55] Unknown: Wtf is mxlemming
[2023-09-14T09:17:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: there are different observer types, oretega, mxlemming, mxlemming lambda, ortega lambda etc
[2023-09-14T09:17:31] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but by default it is already on mxlemming so ehm leave it like that
[2023-09-14T09:17:54] Unknown: I'm not that professional
[2023-09-14T09:18:46] Unknown: I can send here all the settings
[2023-09-14T09:42:19] Mihail: Set motor current to 120A or more. 85 is too low
[2023-09-14T10:15:22] Unknown: <photos/photo_9694@14-09-2023_10-15-22.jpg>
[2023-09-14T10:22:04] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: try mxlemming

[2023-09-14T10:31:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: old vesc firmware
[2023-09-14T10:31:56] sombre_enfant: Remove phase filter
[2023-09-14T10:32:34] Unknown: Isn't it removed already?
[2023-09-14T10:33:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: not by default no, but you might have turned it off.
[2023-09-14T10:33:28] Unknown: Too lazy to check I'm
[2023-09-14T10:33:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but I doubt, cuz when phase filter on it would already have blown up.
[2023-09-14T10:33:57] Unknown: I think it's disabled
[2023-09-14T10:34:10] Unknown: That's what Im saying
[2023-09-14T10:41:58] sombre_enfant: I use this with box flipsky its fine
[2023-09-14T10:43:11] Mirono escooters: Disconnect load and charge it
[2023-09-14T10:48:01] sombre_enfant: Seriously ? I got vsett 10 motor what i should put ?
[2023-09-14T10:55:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: my blade 3mm2 cables burned at 180A as well
[2023-09-14T10:55:53] sombre_enfant: Single
[2023-09-14T10:55:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yes single
[2023-09-14T10:56:04] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: he is using single too
[2023-09-14T10:56:04] sombre_enfant: And heavy weight
[2023-09-14T10:56:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yes im fat
[2023-09-14T10:56:11] sombre_enfant: Ahh
[2023-09-14T10:56:17] sombre_enfant: Why 75200 tho
[2023-09-14T10:56:52] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: idk people buy stuff, someone asked if 75200 is good for his 52v/30A few days ago
[2023-09-14T10:57:09] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: told him to get 75100 or 60100HP
[2023-09-14T10:57:50] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: he now ordered 60100HP ü§î wondering if its any good
[2023-09-14T11:03:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: makerbase 60100hp https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DloNeqB
[2023-09-14T11:03:30] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: only rated for up to 60v but it features inline phase current sensing and rated for peak 200A phase + 8 AWG cable
[2023-09-14T11:03:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: also the schematics are open-source
[2023-09-14T11:06:04] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: https://github.com/makerbase-motor/MKESC-60100HP
[2023-09-14T11:20:13] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Ye
[2023-09-14T11:21:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 100v MOSFETs, caps idk, but sampling chip only up to 70v so that's probably the limitation.
[2023-09-14T11:23:13] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: They could easily modify it to be the new 75100 but shit caps placement, need flat :(
[2023-09-14T11:27:50] Mirono escooters: Is 60100hp better? I mean design wise.
[2023-09-14T11:28:35] Mirono escooters: Will it die when batt cuts xd
[2023-09-14T11:34:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I cannot tell tbh
[2023-09-14T11:34:38] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes kinda
[2023-09-14T11:34:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But I am no expert and I dont know the schematics of the 75100, so eh idk
[2023-09-14T11:35:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but it got better current sensing which is already a good thing
[2023-09-14T11:35:27] Mirono escooters: That's cool
[2023-09-14T12:49:12] Unknown: But 85a motor and 55a battery is ok ?
[2023-09-14T12:54:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: I already explained
[2023-09-14T12:55:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: The mosfet is already the cheapest, and very powerful. Other components for higher voltage cost much more
[2023-09-14T13:05:41] Finn: Cool would be if they ship out the boards without components so you can assemble it yourself
[2023-09-14T13:06:11] Mirono escooters: That's .. A challenge
[2023-09-14T13:06:17] Mirono escooters: You can do with mp2 lol
[2023-09-14T13:06:19] Mirono escooters: But no fun
[2023-09-14T13:28:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs pretty easy, but board , take off components , then copy and paste
[2023-09-14T13:29:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: But why? If you do by your self it‚Äôs more expensive
[2023-09-14T13:29:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: They‚Äôve already the best price
[2023-09-14T13:48:01] Finn: I just mean if you want to improve things such as mosfets then its if you make it
[2023-09-14T13:48:29] Finn: Or the brand is changing their overall product specs and components
[2023-09-14T13:48:32] Finn: Then sure its cheaper
[2023-09-14T14:01:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs not plug play
[2023-09-14T14:02:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Every component may need different configuration , more or less resistor / capacitor , maybe need diodes or not
[2023-09-14T14:22:04] Mirono escooters: It's not that ez

[2023-09-14T18:45:37] Eric Howat: Maybe it‚Äôs because I only have one motor setup and it‚Äôs a dual controller
[2023-09-15T01:04:47] Happy Giraffe: New 4T motor gives 500mOhm resistance when testing first time. I guess it's another go with soldering with lead solder and not the chinese fuck üòÇ
[2023-09-15T01:32:54] Happy Giraffe: My auto setup gave me buzz sound lol
[2023-09-15T01:33:28] Happy Giraffe: I redo all electrical wirings anyway so its no big deal
[2023-09-15T01:33:58] Happy Giraffe: I used 750g outrunner haha, its 10kg motor can be that also
[2023-09-15T01:34:06] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-09-15T01:34:31] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, rerouting, tidying and cutting to lenght
[2023-09-15T01:34:46] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, 2kg?
[2023-09-15T01:34:59] Happy Giraffe: There also 5kg DD ebike hub
[2023-09-15T01:35:35] Happy Giraffe: It's weird as 750g has been fine so far (for other motor's)
[2023-09-15T01:35:45] Happy Giraffe: I hope soüòÇ

[2023-09-15T01:51:58] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, will see. Now its without ferro so can littlebit test that
[2023-09-15T01:52:29] Happy Giraffe: Gotta accelerate slowly as I only have one torque arm bcs my dumbass thought I ordered two
[2023-09-15T01:52:45] Happy Giraffe: Tomorrow is more welding it seems thenüòÖüôà
[2023-09-15T06:32:50] rosheee: I resoldered a fatter cable on the rikshas crap motor and got lower fuckeria resistance Also 8mm plugs for phase, ferrfluid and (because phase wires 3m each i put 8awg phase wires ^^ then with the tronic 250 v1 esc it can easy go uphill with 2 persons on it (2x90kg) without (so far) overheating ^^ BUT happy i didnt gone (not even rly started) deep into it. When try accelerate starting from 0kmh the motor "jumps" Due that the axle spun and so the motorcable twisted And i rly wanna know how set motor start speed 5kmh It does 5-6kw with 13s8p p42 ^^' and 50-60kmh but omg..unsafe as hell at these speeds xD
[2023-09-15T07:02:09] Happy Giraffe: I got a fancy stainless steel torque arm and going to weld another today from 10mm steelüòÇ axle aint going anywhere
[2023-09-15T07:02:39] Happy Giraffe: Soon first test ride with less amps as I dont want to twist the axle lol since only one torque arm
[2023-09-15T08:04:36] Happy Giraffe: Lmao motor 40c max without ferro
[2023-09-15T08:05:22] Happy Giraffe: @jamessoderstrom How much for spin single alu? Vesc cooks nowüòÇ

[2023-09-15T09:57:27] Finn: more battery and maybe passive cooled controller with fins on the side so fresh air cools it
[2023-09-15T09:58:54] Happy Giraffe: Naah no needüòÅ
[2023-09-15T09:59:29] Finn: I got also a frame that kinda looks liuke yours
[2023-09-15T09:59:43] Finn: maybe ill do it too
[2023-09-15T10:00:04] Happy Giraffe: Maybe later another box üòÅ

[2023-09-15T10:01:12] Finn: with passive cooling fins
[2023-09-15T10:05:17] Gabe Enzo: fr
[2023-09-15T10:05:41] Happy Giraffe: Or maybe I mod the battery box to have enough opening to get cool air straight to the current vesc
[2023-09-15T10:06:02] Happy Giraffe: I will only run like 40A batt/150A phase anyways
[2023-09-15T10:06:20] Finn: Is the motor the weakpoint?
[2023-09-15T10:06:35] Finn: Drill some holes in the front and back
[2023-09-15T10:06:42] Finn: And put mesh from the outside
[2023-09-15T10:07:25] Happy Giraffe: Battery
[2023-09-15T10:07:37] Happy Giraffe: Need waterproof
[2023-09-15T10:07:37] Finn: Hm that sucks
[2023-09-15T10:07:49] Finn: radiator on the front
[2023-09-15T10:07:54] Finn: and water cooling esc
[2023-09-15T10:07:57] Happy Giraffe: I might get later a bit higher powered 13s on this box
[2023-09-15T10:08:04] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-09-15T10:08:24] Happy Giraffe: First gen single ubox is shit with cooling, direct -70¬∞c CO2 only way
[2023-09-15T10:08:34] Finn: yeah
[2023-09-15T10:10:54] Finn: <photos/photo_9704@15-09-2023_10-10-54.jpg>
[2023-09-15T10:11:12] Finn: ill maybe get a frame like that or make one myself with thic steel rods
[2023-09-15T10:11:26] Mirono escooters: Stealth bomber frame üëçüëçüëç
[2023-09-15T10:12:01] Finn: esc on the front for good cooling
[2023-09-15T10:12:05] Finn: and 300A battery
[2023-09-15T10:12:25] Mirono escooters: The bottom bracket works fine
[2023-09-15T10:12:30] Mirono escooters: Was my plan someday, xD

[2023-09-15T10:12:41] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-09-15T10:13:08] Finn: stainless steel probably works fine for a bike frame
[2023-09-15T10:13:13] Finn: heavy af tho
[2023-09-15T10:13:32] Mirono escooters: Plain steel
[2023-09-15T10:13:35] Mirono escooters: Stainless too expensive
[2023-09-15T10:13:36] Finn: steel welding i could do at home
[2023-09-15T10:13:49] Mirono escooters: And its massive thic. The frames r good
[2023-09-15T10:13:52] Mirono escooters: Heavy yes. But it adds stability
[2023-09-15T10:13:58] Mirono escooters: 1 wrong weld and u ded üíÄ
[2023-09-15T10:14:01] Finn: no wheelie
[2023-09-15T10:14:16] Finn: nah my dad welds every day at work
[2023-09-15T10:14:20] Finn: he will help me xD
[2023-09-15T10:14:22] Mirono escooters: Owo
[2023-09-15T10:14:23] Mirono escooters: Oki
[2023-09-15T10:14:33] Mirono escooters: Making frame do be hard tho. Matching everything, the forks, the swingarms.
[2023-09-15T10:14:36] Mirono escooters: Tis precision
[2023-09-15T10:14:44] Finn: yeah

[2023-09-15T10:15:19] Finn: thats the bike i have at home
[2023-09-15T10:15:51] Mirono escooters: Good starter
[2023-09-15T10:15:53] Finn: if the ubox 80V100A also runs with 20s then i will take one too
[2023-09-15T10:16:14] Mirono escooters: I started on a mtb too
[2023-09-15T10:16:58] Finn: and its the same size as mks 75100 alu right?
[2023-09-15T10:17:01] Happy Giraffe: Instant buy, if you have all cables etc accessories included
[2023-09-15T10:17:08] Happy Giraffe: Its notüòÇ
[2023-09-15T10:17:19] Finn: no wonder its getting hot
[2023-09-15T10:17:30] Happy Giraffe: Thermal design upside down so cant do much
[2023-09-15T10:17:46] Happy Giraffe: Only way is a 12v industrial noctua fanüòÇ
[2023-09-15T10:25:57] Finn: @Mirono_escooters 20s xiaomi controller in ebike with 8000w hub motor
[2023-09-15T10:26:35] Mirono escooters: >:(
[2023-09-15T10:26:41] Mirono escooters: Mp2 üëçüëç
[2023-09-15T10:27:13] sombre_enfant: Do you still have the link of yours ? How much was the total finally without bat ?
[2023-09-15T10:27:35] Mirono escooters: 1.4k or smth
[2023-09-15T10:27:47] Mirono escooters: I'm selling my frame if u want a quick Europa seller ü§îüôà
[2023-09-15T10:27:54] sombre_enfant: Without bat and controller ?
[2023-09-15T10:28:21] sombre_enfant: Yeah i search frame without battery and controller
[2023-09-15T10:28:29] Mirono escooters: I bought some extra stuff so idk perfectly
[2023-09-15T10:28:30] Mirono escooters: Yes just frame wheels tires suspension (and that shit was expensive, dnm lol)
[2023-09-15T10:28:30] Mirono escooters: Seat
[2023-09-15T10:28:55] Mirono escooters: Ye I sell without
[2023-09-15T12:28:20] Happy Giraffe: After reboot vesc always connects 1 second and then read firmware error
[2023-09-15T12:28:28] Happy Giraffe: Wtf is thisüò≠
[2023-09-15T12:36:04] Happy Giraffe: Fuck this first motor broke and now vescüòÇ
[2023-09-15T12:36:19] Gabe Enzo: L
[2023-09-15T12:36:29] Mirono escooters: Spintend uwu
[2023-09-15T12:37:58] Happy Giraffe: So far so good, now put it together in bit of a hurry and all crap now
[2023-09-15T12:40:01] Happy Giraffe: Power button flashes yellow now when powerin up so something definitely fucked
[2023-09-15T12:48:53] Happy Giraffe: Guess I walk homeüòÖ
[2023-09-15T13:01:06] Happy Giraffe: I suspect 12v aux port , 12v line red cable snapped in half somehow and might have shorted to the grounded frame
[2023-09-15T13:08:56] Happy Giraffe: Conveniently snap before fuse
[2023-09-15T13:11:16] Happy Giraffe: @SibClimb did 3shul need the adc crap or can it directly take in 5v?
[2023-09-15T15:42:57] Happy Giraffe: Two cm after vesc outputüòÇ two cm before my fuse....üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-09-15T15:43:22] Happy Giraffe: Could it use 5v brake and 3,3 throttle at same time?
[2023-09-15T16:19:16] Eric Howat: Will a short phased motor damage a VESC?
[2023-09-15T16:28:58] Mirono escooters: Sometimes
[2023-09-15T17:57:13] Happy Giraffe: 3,3v torque sensor and 5v brake
[2023-09-15T18:28:25] Happy Giraffe: I did it with putting adc1 output directly from t-sens to vesc adc1 and then brake to adc adapter
[2023-09-15T18:28:42] Happy Giraffe: But without the adapter its interesting
[2023-09-15T18:33:47] Happy Giraffe: I need to then print an armor box for all spintend adaptersüòÇ
[2023-09-15T18:42:35] Happy Giraffe: I mean my setup was messy because torque sensor needs 12v from vesc aux port etc
[2023-09-15T18:43:00] Happy Giraffe: Now I design one casing for all wiring inputs and outputs
[2023-09-15T18:43:23] Happy Giraffe: Yup and I also have to ground the frame etc
[2023-09-15T18:43:33] Happy Giraffe: Add so many fuses takes space
[2023-09-15T18:44:02] Happy Giraffe: Also the 12v dcdc for lights and charging phone. I didnt want to use direct 48v for safety reasonsüòÅ
[2023-09-15T18:44:29] Happy Giraffe: I use fuses on the cables
[2023-09-15T18:44:45] Happy Giraffe: But box would be best. Box next to power source
[2023-09-15T18:46:17] Happy Giraffe: A very rare phenomenon for meüòÇ
[2023-09-15T19:05:08] JPPL: Sorry off topic, but good team here, anyone use/try outbraker Abs MTB system?

[2023-09-15T19:21:53] sombre_enfant: Can thats front motor
[2023-09-15T19:22:34] sombre_enfant: Its dual 160/2
[2023-09-15T19:22:48] JPPL: ABS system for front wheel
[2023-09-15T19:23:22] sombre_enfant: Its the amp for both motor
[2023-09-15T19:24:05] Mirono escooters: Wow, I wonder how it detects locked wheel?
[2023-09-15T19:24:07] sombre_enfant: Yes idk why it wont go more
[2023-09-15T19:25:56] sombre_enfant: What should i do ?
[2023-09-15T19:26:13] sombre_enfant: Put mxlemming ?

[2023-09-15T19:49:16] Eric Howat: <photos/photo_9710@15-09-2023_19-49-16.jpg>
[2023-09-15T19:49:31] Eric Howat: Even with Key off getting a reading on the display, any fixes?
[2023-09-15T19:54:57] Eric Howat: Good looks thanks!
[2023-09-15T20:14:26] JPPL: Check some brake tests on YouTube, seems nice, I have one to install will report in future
[2023-09-15T21:08:11] NetworkDir: Makerbase 75100 Why say hw 75300 ? I upload 75100 V2 6.02 !
[2023-09-15T21:08:59] NetworkDir: Bootloader lol
[2023-09-15T21:10:19] Happy Giraffe: Also known as your left hand, the less trained one
[2023-09-15T21:10:23] Mirono escooters: They use 75300 settings
[2023-09-15T21:10:25] Mirono escooters: But is 75100
[2023-09-15T21:10:25] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-09-15T21:25:13] Pablo Fernandez: Does someone know what this is for? If it gets removed and just connect the julets It works aswel
[2023-09-15T21:29:54] Eric Howat: Is that the surron light?
[2023-09-15T21:31:12] Pablo Fernandez: Nami burn
[2023-09-15T21:39:08] Mirono escooters: Led driver?
[2023-09-15T22:03:13] Dimitar: Hi guys, any suggestion for a Europe available vesc for my vsett 11? I need regen braking because right now I don't have one above 57 V with vsetts weak ass controllers. Even magura mt5e can't emergency brake this big ass scooter with my big ass on top of it. I would get tronic 250r but the duties for American imports sometimes can get ridiculously high
[2023-09-15T22:05:44] Pablo Fernandez: No idea some batches got It some dont but in those that have It you can just disconnect It (just connected by the julets) and works everything
[2023-09-15T22:05:56] Pablo Fernandez: So we are trying to Guess what is It for
[2023-09-15T22:07:36] JPPL: Good point, I will install next week
[2023-09-15T22:09:29] Mirono escooters: I am guessing led driver. without, led will burn after x time Some must have it integrated in led.
[2023-09-15T22:11:59] Pablo Fernandez: Might be, actually a good point
[2023-09-15T22:16:21] Happy Giraffe: Jokes aside I wouldnt trust these. If theres sand or whatever you crash only because of abs
[2023-09-15T22:16:48] Happy Giraffe: Best tool is experience how to manage front brake on every occasion
[2023-09-15T22:26:26] Eric Howat: So I‚Äôm confused here. Run VESC Tool on Bluetooth and auto setup a 14 pole 1200w motor with hall sensors. It‚Äôs all wired correctly however in the motor config it‚Äôs showing sensorless and if I go to hall sensor it just acts like regen is on after I write it. Any ideas?
[2023-09-15T22:31:57] Eric Howat: I went color to color from motor harness to canbus
[2023-09-15T22:32:59] Eric Howat: Sorry that‚Äôs probably the wrong terminology it‚Äôs on the right port I promise lol When using the auto detect it shows it‚Äôs a hall sensor motor which is also strange
[2023-09-15T22:33:40] Eric Howat: <photos/photo_9713@15-09-2023_22-33-40.jpg>
[2023-09-15T22:34:55] Eric Howat: I am only running a single motor
[2023-09-15T22:35:04] Eric Howat: For the time being it will be a dual motor setup
[2023-09-15T22:35:40] Eric Howat: This is how it‚Äôs wired except the white is clipped back since there‚Äôs no sensor. Not sure if I‚Äôm missing something in setup. I have 14poles, 5000w max, 52v18ah battery limited to 50amp battery output. If I switch from Sensorless to Hall Sensor it‚Äôs just frozen solid lol
[2023-09-15T22:36:09] Eric Howat: I only have single setup right now
[2023-09-15T22:36:23] Eric Howat: Think it‚Äôs due to the missing channel?
[2023-09-15T22:36:31] Eric Howat: Yeah I haven‚Äôt wired it yet
[2023-09-15T22:36:43] Eric Howat: Waiting on a replacement neck for the scooter I broke it in half üòÅ
[2023-09-15T22:37:11] Eric Howat: I‚Äôm using a v2
[2023-09-15T22:37:19] Eric Howat: <photos/photo_9714@15-09-2023_22-37-19.jpg>
[2023-09-15T22:37:45] Eric Howat: Yeah I used that as a template before I had the v2 in hand
[2023-09-15T22:38:15] Eric Howat: Another question, I think these hubs would be 241mm if they are 10‚Äù right?
[2023-09-15T22:38:42] Eric Howat: These motors are 30 poles?
[2023-09-15T22:38:51] Eric Howat: I counted 28
[2023-09-15T22:38:58] Eric Howat: <photos/photo_9715@15-09-2023_22-38-58.jpg>
[2023-09-15T22:40:52] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: yes
[2023-09-15T22:40:56] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: 30 magnets
[2023-09-15T23:07:14] Eric Howat: Changed to 30 poles now I have no readings at all lol
[2023-09-15T23:14:54] Eric Howat: But at 14 poles I get data
[2023-09-15T23:15:00] Eric Howat: Just no speed data
[2023-09-15T23:18:22] Eric Howat: Good call I get the notification for update
[2023-09-15T23:18:37] Eric Howat: I‚Äôll try that and check back
[2023-09-15T23:41:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes he might think brake is pressed, adc maybe not setup correctly
[2023-09-15T23:42:09] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Another idea might be that it wasn't detecting all can devices yet, I think a predefined list or scanning on start-up (which takes some time) is required.
[2023-09-15T23:52:15] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: with brake it does not.. well shit xd
[2023-09-15T23:52:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: And vesc has no min speed üòî
[2023-09-15T23:53:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Maybe, I don't know.
[2023-09-16T00:23:56] JPPL: That's their point, on sand it safe stop they say
[2023-09-16T04:26:38] Eric Howat: Anyone know how to update firmware from VESC tool on iOS?
[2023-09-16T07:07:45] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes exactly, built in voltage divider, so 5V for ADC
[2023-09-16T13:02:06] TrentXWB: Short question (I forgot): How many poles in VESC Tool for M365 Pro Motor (Fake) and for 1200W (Fake) Motor?
[2023-09-16T13:02:06] TrentXWB: <photos/photo_9719@16-09-2023_13-02-06.jpg>
[2023-09-16T13:03:37] Mirono escooters: Start with 30
[2023-09-16T13:03:42] Mirono escooters: Adjust if off
[2023-09-16T13:13:08] TrentXWB: Thx - so for both motors?
[2023-09-16T13:32:39] Mirono escooters: Ya
[2023-09-16T14:03:58] Happy Giraffe: Would be interesting to try
[2023-09-16T14:13:52] gil guy: Shitty fork ..you can modify it like this. But need another long spring for 2nd side ..

[2023-09-16T14:16:27] NetworkDir: Best turn off turn on method for vesc ? Loop key?
[2023-09-16T14:17:23] NetworkDir: After flash bootloader fixed
[2023-09-16T14:18:37] Mirono escooters: Mod a onoff
[2023-09-16T14:20:59] NetworkDir: Resistor method ?
[2023-09-16T14:39:18] TrentXWB: Is there a mod to make it wider - to install the same motor @front (like rear fake 1200w motor)?
[2023-09-16T14:40:32] Mirono escooters: Wider no Monorim or konyk
[2023-09-16T14:41:31] Simone: Ohlins? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-09-16T15:55:49] TrentXWB: Front Motor is 30 poles / Rear Motor is 36 poles (gear ratio = 1)
[2023-09-16T15:56:07] TrentXWB: Checked with gps
[2023-09-16T15:56:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: Since when motor poles are counted with gps?
[2023-09-16T15:58:32] Mirono escooters: If speed matched he means xD
[2023-09-16T16:01:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think he basically put 8,5 inch diameter of front tire for rear 10 inch tire too

[2023-09-16T16:50:48] Mirko Boni: 10ml is not enough
[2023-09-16T16:51:49] Finn: It obv isnt
[2023-09-16T16:52:19] Mirono escooters: xD what
[2023-09-16T16:52:38] Mirko Boni: The problem is that I didn't have any other ferrofluid.. Wtf
[2023-09-16T16:52:42] Finn: 10ml for that motor?
[2023-09-16T16:52:56] Mirono escooters: Yes, that should be fine
[2023-09-16T16:52:59] Mirono escooters: Its not that of a chonker
[2023-09-16T16:53:03] Finn: Fr?
[2023-09-16T16:53:15] Mirko Boni: Mxus 3000 turbo
[2023-09-16T16:53:17] Finn: Chonky
[2023-09-16T16:53:21] Finn: Brrr
[2023-09-16T16:53:27] Mirono escooters: If your margins are good, 10ml is a lot
[2023-09-16T16:55:49] Mirko Boni: Although I still know how it will behave.. I haven't tried this engine yet
[2023-09-16T16:56:09] Mirono escooters: Ferrofluid first , ride second : D
[2023-09-16T16:56:20] Mirono escooters: I dont think i ride any motor non ferrofluided.
[2023-09-16T16:57:36] Mirko Boni: Now I also put ferrofluids in every engine
[2023-09-16T16:58:52] Simone: there are two solutions: - ferrofluid - holes on the case
[2023-09-16T16:59:12] Simone: the holes are much more efficient but it collects all the dirt
[2023-09-16T17:00:34] Happy Giraffe: Should be
[2023-09-16T17:01:01] Happy Giraffe: I rode, max 40¬∞c motor
[2023-09-16T17:01:15] Happy Giraffe: My other motor with same settings 75-80¬∞cüòÇ
[2023-09-16T17:01:18] Finn: I really need to get
[2023-09-16T17:01:35] Finn: My temp sensor is shorted to ground to frame so cant read tempüò≠
[2023-09-16T17:01:55] Happy Giraffe: I love the 4T turbo, its so smooth. Weight makes it stable for commuting
[2023-09-16T17:02:35] Happy Giraffe: But for offroad it will be Lightning Rods for sure. Even 7kw will lose grip uphillüòÇ
[2023-09-16T17:10:19] Dimos: Hi guys. I have a Gotway rs euc and I want to try a vesc controller. The Gotway controller is 100V 250A phase and ~70A battery.
[2023-09-16T17:10:34] Dimos: <photos/photo_9729@16-09-2023_17-10-34.jpg>
[2023-09-16T17:10:52] Dimos: Here is the motor. Do you think I can push more phase amps?
[2023-09-16T17:11:49] Finn: It can handle more voltage bc wires are thiner
[2023-09-16T17:12:07] Happy Giraffe: Looks big(ish) but temperature sensor is the only way to try
[2023-09-16T17:12:27] Happy Giraffe: Or ferrofluid and ride 5 min and test everytime with hand but its way less accurate
[2023-09-16T17:13:44] Mirono escooters: Watte?
[2023-09-16T17:14:42] Mirono escooters: Defenitely seems so. Have a temp senSor (if it doesn't have from factory) and ferrofluid it.
[2023-09-16T17:14:55] Mirono escooters: A scale would be handy tho to estimate the size
[2023-09-16T17:16:59] Mirko Boni: Are you already driving it?
[2023-09-16T17:17:05] Mirko Boni: üò±
[2023-09-16T17:18:51] Happy Giraffe: One ride and then vesc kaboom
[2023-09-16T17:19:18] Happy Giraffe: Now I reinforce the tiny 24awg cables with some fkin kevlar and 30mm steel box so they wont snap
[2023-09-16T17:22:52] Dimos: Thnx I will put a temperature sensor first. The tube is 275/14 for scale
[2023-09-16T17:24:21] Mirko Boni: What is the steel box for?
[2023-09-16T17:27:33] Happy Giraffe: So the 24awg cables wont get snapped lol, jokes aside I will print a small box to house all fuses and protect the cables with some sleeve
[2023-09-16T17:28:02] Happy Giraffe: If assault rifle cant penetrate it, maybe it will survive my use
[2023-09-16T17:28:14] Mirko Boni: Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
[2023-09-16T17:28:23] Mirko Boni: But it's terrible üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-09-16T17:29:09] Mirko Boni: Do you have any idea how many battery and phase amps we can set?
[2023-09-16T17:29:16] Happy Giraffe: Yeah the cable snapped right before my fuseüòÖ
[2023-09-16T17:29:24] Happy Giraffe: On Mxus?
[2023-09-16T17:29:28] Mirko Boni: Yess
[2023-09-16T17:29:41] Happy Giraffe: You have thermistor installed?
[2023-09-16T17:29:56] Happy Giraffe: Or connected*
[2023-09-16T17:30:06] Mirko Boni: I don't know this thermistor
[2023-09-16T17:30:29] Happy Giraffe: It should be already there with every 3k turbo, are you using vesc?
[2023-09-16T17:30:34] Mirko Boni: I connect the motor directly to the vesc
[2023-09-16T17:30:51] Happy Giraffe: Thermistor is the 6th wire with the hall
[2023-09-16T17:30:53] Mirko Boni: Yess spintend ubox 200A
[2023-09-16T17:31:15] Mirko Boni: Ohhh temperature sensor check? White thread?
[2023-09-16T17:31:22] Happy Giraffe: With thermistor 60A batt 150A phase shouldnt be problem
[2023-09-16T17:31:26] Happy Giraffe: Yes
[2023-09-16T17:31:40] Mirko Boni: Yes, my engine has a white wire
[2023-09-16T17:31:48] Happy Giraffe: When you do motor detection it will tell you "temperature sensor = true"
[2023-09-16T17:31:55] Happy Giraffe: Ofc you must connect it
[2023-09-16T17:32:00] Mirko Boni: So in your opinion 100A of battery and 200A of phase are dangerous?
[2023-09-16T17:32:21] Mirko Boni: Yes happy, I use it in my scooters
[2023-09-16T17:33:14] Happy Giraffe: Why? If you have proper torque arms and thermistor in use, it will be ok
[2023-09-16T17:33:48] Mirko Boni: No no, I'm talking so as not to burn the engine
[2023-09-16T17:34:05] Mirko Boni: I'm afraid the engine might get damaged
[2023-09-16T17:34:28] Happy Giraffe: You have temp sensor its ok
[2023-09-16T17:34:45] Happy Giraffe: First start maybe 50/120 then 60/150 80/180
[2023-09-16T17:34:52] Happy Giraffe: If you notice problems then stop
[2023-09-16T17:34:57] Mirko Boni: Ok.. So as long as the temperature doesn't rise, can I increase the Amperes without problems?
[2023-09-16T17:35:09] Mirko Boni: Ok perfect
[2023-09-16T17:35:22] Happy Giraffe: Yes but increase small incriments
[2023-09-16T17:35:26] Mirko Boni: Thanks for your help
[2023-09-16T17:35:32] Mirko Boni: Yess ok
[2023-09-16T17:37:32] Oreo huzky: How many watts has the motor?
[2023-09-16T17:37:47] Mirko Boni: 3000w
[2023-09-16T17:38:13] Oreo huzky: Oof because I almost have the same amps with my 500W motor
[2023-09-16T17:38:28] Mirko Boni: Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah fantastic
[2023-09-16T17:38:37] Oreo huzky: Poor thing
[2023-09-16T17:38:46] Oreo huzky: At 20s it gets soo hot
[2023-09-16T17:39:14] Oreo huzky: And also the acceleration seems to have go down a bit
[2023-09-16T17:40:14] Mirko Boni: Maybe it broke up? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-09-16T17:42:14] Oreo huzky: Magnets in the motor damaged from heat I‚Äôve looked into the motor and it was totally fine the only thing I did I added some Greece in the bearings it was a bit squeaky
[2023-09-16T17:52:25] NetworkDir: Noice
[2023-09-16T17:54:49] Mirko Boni: It's incredible.. Your little engine has excellent resistance
[2023-09-16T17:55:56] Happy Giraffe: Watts marked on motor mean little to nothing
[2023-09-16T17:56:16] Happy Giraffe: Only 300w and 5000w means other is big other small but other than thatüòÅ
[2023-09-16T17:59:27] sombre_enfant: Whats that ?
[2023-09-16T18:24:22] NetworkDir: Turn off on mod
[2023-09-16T18:30:28] Oreo huzky: I know I was just comparing

[2023-09-16T19:09:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Tell us how.
[2023-09-16T19:10:18] Finn: No way
[2023-09-16T19:26:42] puneDir: He said pull down resistor or something
[2023-09-16T19:27:00] puneDir: But they only tested it at low speed and not for so long
[2023-09-16T19:27:08] puneDir: So idk if its reliable

[2023-09-17T00:40:17] Happy Giraffe: For battery hell no
[2023-09-17T00:40:27] Happy Giraffe: Calculate it as I said 3 timesüòÇ
[2023-09-17T00:40:39] NetworkDir: Lol how i can calculate
[2023-09-17T00:40:44] Happy Giraffe: Or maybe it's written on side of battery
[2023-09-17T00:41:03] Happy Giraffe: Cell charge current x the parallel cells
[2023-09-17T00:41:25] NetworkDir: I know this. I have 2 batterys Internal 50A External 30A
[2023-09-17T00:41:32] Happy Giraffe: Or put -5A batt to be safe
[2023-09-17T00:41:44] NetworkDir: Okay
[2023-09-17T00:41:57] Happy Giraffe: You want to definitely get more info

[2023-09-17T13:06:35] Happy Giraffe: I think it you really put 10ml it will even out when spinning fast. Its good for higher speeds but 8ml more than enough for this motor
[2023-09-17T13:07:14] Happy Giraffe: Only increasing the drag a little on low speeds
[2023-09-17T13:12:17] Mirono escooters: Better a lil too much, it'll fly out
[2023-09-17T13:16:41] Mirko Boni: Do you think I exaggerated?
[2023-09-17T13:17:14] Mirko Boni: I hope I didn't exaggerate..
[2023-09-17T13:20:10] Gabe Enzo: Fat or thin thermal pads for FETs?
[2023-09-17T13:20:12] Gabe Enzo: @Mirono_escooters
[2023-09-17T13:23:38] Mirono escooters: Thin af
[2023-09-17T13:23:43] Mirono escooters: 0.5mm and sub
[2023-09-17T13:24:06] Gabe Enzo: I'll use the thinnest I have and hope for the best
[2023-09-17T13:24:10] Finn: New handlebar for pro2
[2023-09-17T13:24:20] Gabe Enzo: yo I've been looking for pro 2 handlebars
[2023-09-17T13:24:20] Finn: Hopefully it fixes wobble at higher speeds
[2023-09-17T13:24:28] Gabe Enzo: how do you know if it fits the pro?
[2023-09-17T13:24:28] Mirono escooters: Wider helps controlling
[2023-09-17T13:24:42] Finn: 22mm diameter
[2023-09-17T13:24:48] Finn: But you need to drill a lot
[2023-09-17T13:24:57] Gabe Enzo: in what form.

[2023-09-17T13:27:01] Finn: Also for the other side
[2023-09-17T13:28:05] Finn: <video_file>
[2023-09-17T13:30:06] Finn: I will probably weld it to the mechanism
[2023-09-17T13:30:10] Finn: So it has more stability
[2023-09-17T13:30:16] Finn: <photos/photo_9745@17-09-2023_13-30-16.jpg>
[2023-09-17T13:30:23] Finn: Arround this and other side
[2023-09-17T13:31:45] Mirko Boni: interesting this graph
[2023-09-17T13:40:20] Gabe Enzo: bit dirty but looks okay

[2023-09-17T13:40:47] Gabe Enzo: only those shit Ikea ones
[2023-09-17T13:48:44] Happy Giraffe: Yes but it's alright as it will settle in, did you seal motor with silicone?
[2023-09-17T13:49:27] Mirko Boni: Yess I used silicone resistant to 100C
[2023-09-17T13:50:14] Happy Giraffe: üëç
[2023-09-17T13:50:32] Mirko Boni: Did you seal?
[2023-09-17T13:50:49] Happy Giraffe: Next time use bit higher ¬∞c one
[2023-09-17T13:50:56] Happy Giraffe: Havent put ferro in yet
[2023-09-17T13:51:54] Mirko Boni: I have always used this in my engines, so far I have had no problems.. I haven't thought of using a stronger one
[2023-09-17T13:53:15] Happy Giraffe: Yeah I think outer shell never reaches 100 anyway
[2023-09-17T13:54:07] Mirko Boni: if it were to reach 100C then inside it would be 140C ah ah ah ah ah
[2023-09-17T13:54:07] Happy Giraffe: Then it would be 70¬∞c difference with air outside that would cool it instantly
[2023-09-17T13:54:14] Happy Giraffe: Yeah even moreüòÇ
[2023-09-17T13:54:30] Mirko Boni: OMG

[2023-09-17T14:27:51] Happy Giraffe: 24awg should if brake lights are not so power hungry
[2023-09-17T14:28:02] Happy Giraffe: If they are 12v then current will be minimal
[2023-09-17T14:28:09] Happy Giraffe: Like 0.4A max or so
[2023-09-17T14:28:10] Gabe Enzo: 5v and microamps.
[2023-09-17T14:28:28] Gabe Enzo: think it's 5v
[2023-09-17T14:28:30] Gabe Enzo: 5w
[2023-09-17T14:28:38] Gabe Enzo: 1 amp I think then
[2023-09-17T14:28:42] Happy Giraffe: Maybe 22awg then
[2023-09-17T14:43:35] Finn: You fr?
[2023-09-17T14:56:00] Mirono escooters: Wide ofcourse good. More lever, more precise control

[2023-09-17T15:24:52] puneDir: <photos/photo_9750@17-09-2023_15-24-52.jpg>
[2023-09-17T15:27:29] Finn: Hey does anyone recommend a gas throttle?
[2023-09-17T15:27:39] Finn: Twist isnt good as i heard
[2023-09-17T15:37:54] Awyba: why that?
[2023-09-17T15:49:08] puneDir: <animation>
[2023-09-17T15:53:44] Happy Giraffe: Coming closer lol
[2023-09-17T15:53:59] Happy Giraffe: Megatron Online
[2023-09-17T16:07:38] Finn: Both sides 50mm shorter. Much better now
[2023-09-17T16:14:01] Happy Giraffe: @koxx3 @SibClimb Are you going to do a 1 hour long youtube video explaining all the features of the smartdisplay?üòÅ
[2023-09-17T16:15:02] koxx / Francois Deslandes: one or multiple videos, yes
[2023-09-17T16:18:36] Happy Giraffe: I will propably get it for my DH bike build but it will be in 1-2 years when I land a good paying job so build budget is almost limitlessüòÅ
[2023-09-17T16:29:35] heimdler: Thanks @francois_schempers
[2023-09-17T16:31:34] heimdler: Welcome @brynkush

[2023-09-17T16:35:06] heimdler: I guess everyone that joins here needs help
[2023-09-17T16:36:36] francois schempers: not really ^^ it's more of a hub of knowledge now
[2023-09-17T16:48:53] Denis Yurev: /toprep
[2023-09-17T16:51:36] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-09-17T16:56:37] francois schempers: ahah no toprep here xD
[2023-09-17T19:21:38] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @jamessoderstrom how much field weakening you use per esc on your g30?
[2023-09-17T19:26:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: ah
[2023-09-17T19:26:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I only put 40A XD
[2023-09-17T19:27:11] puneDir: You use fwk?
[2023-09-17T19:27:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: sure?
[2023-09-17T19:27:35] puneDir: i thought high kw motor was enough
[2023-09-17T19:28:07] puneDir: whats the max fwk g30 gen1 can handle
[2023-09-17T19:28:19] puneDir: me with 16kv üòï
[2023-09-17T19:28:22] puneDir: why?
[2023-09-17T19:28:55] puneDir: its the only one i have üòÑ
[2023-09-17T19:29:26] puneDir: (i bought pro2 instead of 2 50h motors)
[2023-09-17T19:30:41] puneDir: cuz i need to drive something until cengiz sends my g30
[2023-09-17T19:30:59] puneDir: <photos/photo_9752@17-09-2023_19-30-59.jpg>
[2023-09-17T19:32:19] puneDir: thats what im doing :D
[2023-09-17T19:32:47] puneDir: I bought the pro2 for 5k liras 1k suspension 1.5k 48v kit Some cleaning and 10 inch tires And now its worth 13-14k liras
[2023-09-17T19:34:06] NetworkDir: Fw with this config Fw not work for me 0A 73km/h at air 15A 73km/h at air
[2023-09-17T19:34:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: maybe your vesc limited to 73?
[2023-09-17T19:35:14] NetworkDir: Hmm how i can increase limit ?
[2023-09-17T19:35:21] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: apply profile 400km/h what ever
[2023-09-17T19:35:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: so it does not limit
[2023-09-17T19:35:51] puneDir: makerbase has that?
[2023-09-17T19:35:55] NetworkDir: Okay
[2023-09-17T19:36:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: ???
[2023-09-17T19:36:09] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: every vesc has that
[2023-09-17T19:36:36] sombre_enfant: Where ?
[2023-09-17T19:36:50] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: huh? profiles and rpm?
[2023-09-17T19:37:00] puneDir: mines doesnt had that
[2023-09-17T19:37:16] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: ü§î
[2023-09-17T19:38:02] puneDir: Oh
[2023-09-17T19:38:18] puneDir: Weird
[2023-09-17T19:38:22] puneDir: Mines was making 150+
[2023-09-17T19:38:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and 74 seems to be the maximum when leaving everything at default (wheel size)
[2023-09-17T19:38:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: so ehm yes it is probably why @NetworkDir does not reach more speed
[2023-09-17T19:39:16] puneDir: Nice information
[2023-09-17T19:39:22] puneDir: I didnt know that
[2023-09-17T19:39:24] puneDir: Thanks!
[2023-09-17T19:50:14] NetworkDir: I test and say results
[2023-09-17T21:18:42] NetworkDir: Not work
[2023-09-17T21:18:43] NetworkDir: <sticker>
[2023-09-18T09:22:56] Pablo Fernandez: I dont know if It has the most fucked Up geometry ive seen or the best one lol
[2023-09-18T09:23:04] Pablo Fernandez: But It looks awful
[2023-09-18T09:31:27] Oreo huzky: I dont like front suspension they are scary and easy to break
[2023-09-18T09:33:06] Pablo Fernandez: Tires look too Big for the scooter 13 inches is crazy. I see the nami in front all day long and still looks huge, cant imagine that
[2023-09-18T09:39:10] Gabe Enzo: that looks so hard to turn.
[2023-09-18T09:39:43] Gabe Enzo: my new kugoo G4 has a system like that. I don't mind because I'm lightweight and the chances of it breaking are essentially zero. being a feather is helpful
[2023-09-18T11:29:59] Happy Giraffe: Torque arm prototype

[2023-09-18T13:05:08] Simone: finally qs273 are ready üòÖ
[2023-09-18T13:07:30] Happy Giraffe: For bike?
[2023-09-18T13:09:09] Simone: Yes, will finish on the Super73
[2023-09-18T13:09:42] Happy Giraffe: If controller and battery allow it, power will be insaneüòÇ
[2023-09-18T13:10:35] Simone: The idea is to put 3SHUL C700 and a 22S14P with moli p42
[2023-09-18T13:40:47] Happy Giraffe: Maybe bit overkill haha. You wont have much grip/you dont have front wheel downüòÅ
[2023-09-18T13:42:03] Happy Giraffe: 33,000W will be insaneüòÇ
[2023-09-18T13:49:34] Gabe Enzo: 500 amps peak at 20s yes.
[2023-09-18T13:49:35] Gabe Enzo: ?
[2023-09-18T13:50:34] Simone: I don't know how such power behaves on an ebike... on the escooter I had 33.5kw
[2023-09-18T13:50:59] Gabe Enzo: scary with rwd I bet.
[2023-09-18T13:51:07] Gabe Enzo: Scooters seem so much safer to me üòÇ
[2023-09-18T13:54:57] Nik: free wheelies üòÇ
[2023-09-18T14:15:19] Gabe Enzo: I love FWD because you can burnout that fucker anytime anywhere and impress anyone
[2023-09-18T14:15:29] Gabe Enzo: No need to lean front or anything like with RWD burnouts LOL
[2023-09-18T14:47:38] francois schempers: that's what what somebody who don't have enough Watts would say ! üòÇüòÇ
[2023-09-18T14:51:33] Nik: same, but i also like a super 73 with 15/20 some kw, shits funny as soon as you give it a bit of throttle you're up with the front wheel
[2023-09-18T14:52:10] Nik: hilarious with slicks on ü§£
[2023-09-18T15:02:21] Finn: Can anyone measure the cable length of the pro2 ble cable?
[2023-09-18T17:34:32] Gabe Enzo: Genuine non ESC related question that will probably prevent me from exploding my 500k house in the future if answered. Say I have two 20s4p batteries, One being old (120 cycles, 3yo) and the other being fresh cells. All cells are identical in specs. Would this be a fire hazard? the two packs will have seperate BMS's. that being 2x20s. Assuming the charge curves are close (OR even if they aren't close for that matter ) Does this matter if there is two BMS's managing each 20s4p (X2)
[2023-09-18T17:36:05] Gabe Enzo: If one pack is at 90% and the other at 85% then would this cause a surge due to inbalance as the BMS's can't absorb power while exalting it? EVEN if I do get identical cells (charge curve and all) Then I still believe there would be an issue as one stack of cells is aged?
[2023-09-18T17:38:15] Gabe Enzo: I know those powerwall cretins will mix 5000 brands of cells in an array and somehow not explode their house so how do they do it?
[2023-09-18T17:41:15] francois schempers: main problem would be the new pack charging too strongly the old one, too bad rita only do 15s, that could have solve your problem
[2023-09-18T17:46:48] Gabe Enzo: Seperate BMS's on each stack will solve this issue. (I think)
[2023-09-18T17:55:55] Happy Giraffe: Where did you find Rita?üòÇ
[2023-09-18T17:56:34] francois schempers: Well if you're bms allow for charge through discharge at a hight enough rate and the cells can endure it, you're fine
[2023-09-18T18:27:10] NetworkDir: At air nice but on road acceleration low 110A phase 170A absolute phase 35A battery current
[2023-09-18T18:27:12] NetworkDir: Traction control off
[2023-09-18T18:27:38] Mirono escooters: 35a batt isn't loads
[2023-09-18T18:28:01] Mirono escooters: Or is it cutting?
[2023-09-18T18:28:17] NetworkDir: At 25A same
[2023-09-18T18:28:27] NetworkDir: Zero controller more torquely
[2023-09-18T18:28:34] francois schempers: <photos/photo_9760@18-09-2023_18-28-34.jpg>
[2023-09-18T18:28:48] NetworkDir: 50A internal bat 30A external bat
[2023-09-18T18:29:07] Mirono escooters: Bldc shit square wave
[2023-09-18T18:29:33] NetworkDir: But at vesc now i have lower torque at start speed Something wrong at config
[2023-09-18T18:30:31] NetworkDir: Also at slopes motor want to cut off and cant road
[2023-09-18T18:30:31] Mirono escooters: Na, foc is just nicer and smoother at start speed
[2023-09-18T18:30:33] NetworkDir: Interesting
[2023-09-18T18:30:50] NetworkDir: And bldc mode same ü§ï
[2023-09-18T18:31:13] Eric Howat: What vesc are you using?
[2023-09-18T18:31:18] NetworkDir: And field weaking not work
[2023-09-18T18:31:32] NetworkDir: Makerbase 75100
[2023-09-18T18:32:57] NetworkDir: <video_file>
[2023-09-18T18:33:34] Eric Howat: Show the data and what you have your motors setup too
[2023-09-18T18:33:47] NetworkDir: W8
[2023-09-18T18:37:10] NetworkDir: Old values Now 110A phase 160A absolute phase 35A battery current
[2023-09-18T18:37:40] NetworkDir: Also i try with 16 and 30khz pwm freq

[2023-09-18T18:38:11] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_9764@18-09-2023_18-38-11.jpg>
[2023-09-18T18:46:55] Eric Howat: Why is your battery current maxed at 35amp isn‚Äôt that a 52v ?
[2023-09-18T18:47:21] Eric Howat: I should say, what battery are you running?
[2023-09-18T18:47:50] NetworkDir: Dual drive 35A 52V
[2023-09-18T18:47:55] NetworkDir: 70A 52V in total
[2023-09-18T18:48:06] NetworkDir: 50A internal bat 30A external bat
[2023-09-18T18:49:01] Eric Howat: So are you limiting the 35amps for some reason? I‚Äôm not an expert, but wouldn‚Äôt you be able to still pull 50amp max based upon the larger 50amp battery?
[2023-09-18T18:49:58] NetworkDir: I have 2 controller 35A for A 35A for B Total 70A and my bms max can give 80A .
[2023-09-18T18:50:07] NetworkDir: Normal zero controllers 25-25A
[2023-09-18T18:50:16] NetworkDir: Nanrobot d6 28-28
[2023-09-18T18:52:39] Eric Howat: Okay I see what your doing. Sounds like we need some more input from the experts here lol what is your motor poles set too and all of that stuff, are you running hallsensor/sensorless etc?
[2023-09-18T18:52:40] NetworkDir: Actually i love it foc smoth at start speed But for race and somethings i need higher torque at start speed
[2023-09-18T18:52:51] Happy Giraffe: Try more phase depending esc and motor
[2023-09-18T18:52:59] Happy Giraffe: Awd typically required
[2023-09-18T18:53:21] NetworkDir: Makebase 75100 how much max phase ?
[2023-09-18T18:53:28] NetworkDir: Motor datas
[2023-09-18T18:54:32] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_9766@18-09-2023_18-54-32.jpg>
[2023-09-18T18:57:07] Eric Howat: Okay I run that same motor
[2023-09-18T18:57:15] Eric Howat: Let me fire mine up I‚Äôll show you where I‚Äôm at
[2023-09-18T18:57:25] NetworkDir: In first i think battery cant give current but i see voltage drops 4-5V max drops
[2023-09-18T19:00:04] francois schempers: does it normalise back up once you've gained speed or does it stay dropped until you stop accelerating ?
[2023-09-18T19:01:05] Eric Howat: Why is EPRM limit set to 80%
[2023-09-18T19:01:57] NetworkDir: Now i can‚Äôt explain i try again and says
[2023-09-18T19:02:07] NetworkDir: I dont know default value
[2023-09-18T19:02:42] puneDir: Set it to 100
[2023-09-18T19:03:30] NetworkDir: And field weaking for this not works ?
[2023-09-18T19:03:49] puneDir: Probably
[2023-09-18T19:04:24] NetworkDir: Hmm
[2023-09-18T19:05:49] Mirono escooters: Wdym
[2023-09-18T19:06:33] NetworkDir: At air without field weaking 73km/h with 15A field weaking same 73km/h
[2023-09-18T19:07:31] puneDir: Change erpm limit
[2023-09-18T19:08:38] NetworkDir: Ok
[2023-09-18T19:08:41] Eric Howat: Does it happen when you aren‚Äôt playing with field weaking? Maybe try setting the motor up automatically and go from there making small changes
[2023-09-18T19:09:18] NetworkDir: Nope
[2023-09-18T19:09:47] NetworkDir: I with try foc wizard setup for few times
[2023-09-18T19:16:02] NetworkDir: <video_file>
[2023-09-18T19:19:56] NetworkDir: <video_file>
[2023-09-18T19:19:57] NetworkDir: Nice field weaking problem solved by erpm limit
[2023-09-18T19:20:56] Eric Howat: So was it just the erpm limit you were having issues with?
[2023-09-18T19:21:46] Eric Howat: For some reason I personally am having issues with data when using hallsensors but under sensorless I get all data minus speedometer lol
[2023-09-18T19:21:52] NetworkDir: Yessss Low torque at start speed and field weaking solved !
[2023-09-18T19:21:56] NetworkDir: Fucking erpm limit
[2023-09-18T19:21:58] NetworkDir: Thnaks
[2023-09-18T19:22:07] NetworkDir: Torque nice
[2023-09-18T19:22:14] Eric Howat: Good stuff man.
[2023-09-18T19:22:15] NetworkDir: Thanks all guys
[2023-09-18T19:24:07] Happy Giraffe: What magnet count have you put in info tab?
[2023-09-18T19:24:32] NetworkDir: I set 30 poles
[2023-09-18T19:26:25] NetworkDir: On next months i must purchase alupcb Normal makerbase not very good
[2023-09-18T20:00:22] NetworkDir: 6.02 75100 V2 Version
[2023-09-18T20:00:31] NetworkDir: How i can disable lambda obsever ?
[2023-09-18T20:01:57] Eric Howat: Well tell us, does it go 69kmh/42mph under load?
[2023-09-18T20:02:13] NetworkDir: Need test but 100%
[2023-09-18T20:02:33] Eric Howat: Sweet. I‚Äôm hoping to pull that out of my varla on a 52v battery
[2023-09-18T20:03:01] Eric Howat: I also have the 1200w hubs not that it makes any real difference imo
[2023-09-18T20:03:19] NetworkDir: 25-25A Can reach to 60 km/h 28-28A Can reach 67km/h And 35-35A 40-40A with high phase and field weaking must 75-80km/h
[2023-09-18T20:04:05] NetworkDir: 40-40A sick 4700W peak power üî•
[2023-09-18T20:04:07] Eric Howat: Yeah ima be limited to 25x2 because of the battery. Not sure if I can use field weakening don‚Äôt know Jack about it honestly
[2023-09-18T20:04:27] Eric Howat: I‚Äôve had it peak single motor at 3,500
[2023-09-18T20:04:45] Eric Howat: I‚Äôm still trying to figure out why I have no speedometer lol
[2023-09-18T20:04:48] NetworkDir: You can use 5A field weaking
[2023-09-18T20:04:56] NetworkDir: Lol
[2023-09-18T20:04:59] Eric Howat: Is it worth it?
[2023-09-18T20:05:05] NetworkDir: Need test
[2023-09-18T20:05:21] Eric Howat: Yeah forsure. I‚Äôm waiting on a neck currently before I can finish my build lol
[2023-09-18T20:05:29] NetworkDir: I wait for full charge battery and test on road
[2023-09-18T20:05:45] NetworkDir: Do you have zero 10x frame?
[2023-09-18T20:06:13] Eric Howat: Yeah
[2023-09-18T20:06:17] Eric Howat: <photos/photo_9768@18-09-2023_20-06-17.jpg>
[2023-09-18T20:06:24] Eric Howat: This is kinda holding me back LOL
[2023-09-18T20:06:50] NetworkDir: F
[2023-09-18T20:06:53] NetworkDir: But normal
[2023-09-18T20:07:01] NetworkDir: Your profile says anything
[2023-09-18T20:07:09] NetworkDir: You sex with scooter not road lol
[2023-09-18T20:07:34] Eric Howat: Haha yeah I figured it would have happened much sooner. Oh well new neck should be here tomorrow
[2023-09-18T20:07:48] NetworkDir: Steering damper important for zero and new flat handle bar
[2023-09-18T20:07:51] Eric Howat: I‚Äôm going to end up building a stronger one
[2023-09-18T20:08:25] Eric Howat: <photos/photo_9769@18-09-2023_20-08-25.jpg>
[2023-09-18T20:08:41] NetworkDir: Nice
[2023-09-18T20:08:56] Eric Howat: I‚Äôve got some bars and 160mm rotors on it. Just was about to install the vesc was on the way to do it and it just randomly crack in two haha
[2023-09-18T20:09:16] NetworkDir: Okay thank you
[2023-09-18T20:09:34] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_9770@18-09-2023_20-09-34.jpg>
[2023-09-18T20:09:55] Eric Howat: You charge outside like that?
[2023-09-18T20:10:02] NetworkDir: Flat handlebar very nice thank you james doe help
[2023-09-18T20:10:37] NetworkDir: No here garage and scooter mod shop
[2023-09-18T20:10:56] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_9772@18-09-2023_20-10-56.jpg>
[2023-09-18T20:11:55] Eric Howat: That‚Äôs risky! I charge mine outside during daylight hours under a bunch of cameras and locked brakes lol
[2023-09-18T20:12:15] Eric Howat: <photos/photo_9773@18-09-2023_20-12-15.jpg>
[2023-09-18T20:12:19] Eric Howat: Mine use to look similar lol
[2023-09-18T20:12:57] NetworkDir: No i see scooter in shop none can theft lol
[2023-09-18T20:13:29] NetworkDir: And actually volt meter with key
[2023-09-18T20:13:41] Eric Howat: <photos/photo_9776@18-09-2023_20-13-41.jpg>
[2023-09-18T20:13:51] Eric Howat: Yessir I just got a blue one to match my color scheme lol
[2023-09-18T20:13:56] NetworkDir: You modded vescs?
[2023-09-18T20:14:01] NetworkDir: For off and on
[2023-09-18T20:14:10] Eric Howat: Yeah it‚Äôs off and on
[2023-09-18T20:14:27] Eric Howat: <video_file>
[2023-09-18T20:14:47] Eric Howat: Yes ubox v2 it‚Äôs already supported no mods
[2023-09-18T20:15:01] NetworkDir: Resistor method easy
[2023-09-18T20:15:39] Eric Howat: I know it‚Äôs more then double the price of a fly sky but the ubox is so nice. Highly recommend
[2023-09-18T20:15:44] Finn: Lmao
[2023-09-18T20:15:52] Finn: ThtüíÄ
[2023-09-18T20:16:13] NetworkDir: Ubox priceüíÄ
[2023-09-18T20:16:45] NetworkDir: Work fine without problems Whats wrong?üòÇ
[2023-09-18T20:16:59] Finn: NothingüòÇ
[2023-09-18T20:17:07] Eric Howat: I think I paid with Bluetooth and everything for the J box (75v100ax2) around $275 shipped
[2023-09-18T20:17:08] Finn: If it works nice
[2023-09-18T20:17:36] NetworkDir: Lol i make bluetooth module with esp32
[2023-09-18T20:17:43] NetworkDir: Laggy but fine can help
[2023-09-18T20:17:47] Eric Howat: After all is said and done, throttles light key switch wire etc I‚Äôm at like $360 USD
[2023-09-18T20:18:30] Eric Howat: It was a much better choice then upgrading to a vsett10+. Didn‚Äôt like how it rode but loved the power. Going 60v this winter and should be a perfect little build
[2023-09-18T20:19:26] NetworkDir: Vsett 10+ trail and stability little bit better from zero 10x And bigger frame
[2023-09-18T20:19:50] NetworkDir: But segway gt2 more more better
[2023-09-18T20:20:12] Eric Howat: It‚Äôs nice don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôve ridden it a couple times now, but it‚Äôs geometry is wrong at high speed it‚Äôs scary, I think the handle bar pole is too tall
[2023-09-18T20:20:54] Eric Howat: I do 35-40mph on the t10ddm and feel perfectly safe on the vsett10+ feels like your going to wobble off after 35mph. Even has aftermarket bars
[2023-09-18T20:21:15] Eric Howat: And I‚Äôve been riding 40+mph scooters for 20 years lol
[2023-09-18T20:21:16] NetworkDir: Steering damper important
[2023-09-18T20:21:45] Eric Howat: I agree but there isn‚Äôt really a good one for vsett10+ that I saw
[2023-09-18T20:22:31] Eric Howat: I‚Äôve played with bar height and high speed stability on gopeds for along time and my impression is the height of the bars makes it more unstable. I actually wanted to cut my pole down slightly but never got around to it
[2023-09-18T20:23:45] puneDir: Build my ninebot
[2023-09-18T20:24:18] NetworkDir: Tomorrow
[2023-09-18T20:46:33] puneDir: it matters on cengiz abi
[2023-09-18T20:46:39] puneDir: but he said it will be done in this week
[2023-09-18T20:50:26] puneDir: Cengiz's other jobs
[2023-09-18T20:50:32] puneDir: :(
[2023-09-18T20:54:13] puneDir: I have no idea
[2023-09-18T21:58:54] sombre_enfant: Nope
[2023-09-18T22:18:17] NetworkDir: Now tested on road top speed 59km/h Esc temp 37 degrees at 20 degree weather I think my phase low tomorrow with higher phase and field weaking test again
[2023-09-18T22:28:20] NetworkDir: Makerbase box little bit better from flipsky I put thermal paste at mosfets And thermal pad in down and up controllers passive cooller
[2023-09-18T22:29:10] FrizerSeb: greetings, after 3500km with the spinted 80v under 21s holding up perfectly, still not burned üòÖ I think it is really designed for 22s
[2023-09-18T22:29:50] NetworkDir: I can‚Äôt understand phase how works. For example my old controllers at 25-25A can reach to 61km/h But with vesc and 35-35A + 15A FW Same 60km/h Probably my phases low
[2023-09-18T22:29:52] FrizerSeb: just like the 200a 85a
[2023-09-18T22:30:30] NetworkDir: w8
[2023-09-18T22:31:20] NetworkDir: Yes i reach 60-61km/h at gps with stock controllers
[2023-09-18T22:31:39] NetworkDir: Fucking ios version
[2023-09-18T22:31:45] Eric Howat: I don‚Äôt prefer thermal pads they don‚Äôt really work as well as nice bare metal surface and high temp / good quailty thermal paste
[2023-09-18T22:31:55] NetworkDir: 60kmh
[2023-09-18T22:32:32] Eric Howat: So your saying you didn‚Äôt pick up any gains from the VESC over stock controllers?
[2023-09-18T22:32:38] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_9779@18-09-2023_22-32-38.jpg>
[2023-09-18T22:33:06] NetworkDir: With this settings no
[2023-09-18T22:33:08] FrizerSeb: have you activated ortega original and bemf dec?
[2023-09-18T22:33:31] NetworkDir: I dont know what ortega and bemf dec
[2023-09-18T22:33:51] Eric Howat: Are you on sensorless or hall sensors
[2023-09-18T22:34:07] NetworkDir: Yes i think you can over tcp
[2023-09-18T22:34:11] NetworkDir: Hall sensor
[2023-09-18T22:34:29] Eric Howat: Please post back what you find I‚Äôm curious
[2023-09-18T22:34:29] NetworkDir: Lol if you want tomorrow
[2023-09-18T22:35:07] NetworkDir: Okay wait
[2023-09-18T22:35:25] FrizerSeb: Probably in mxlemming
[2023-09-18T22:44:10] Oreo huzky: What is max phase current of flipsky 75100
[2023-09-18T22:44:45] FrizerSeb: Control type set : current
[2023-09-18T22:44:45] FrizerSeb: <photos/photo_9763@18-09-2023_18-37-59.jpg>
[2023-09-18T22:47:35] NetworkDir: I think its for brake sensors for regen
[2023-09-18T22:47:54] NetworkDir: James make a configs and .. tomorrow i test and say results
[2023-09-18T22:48:42] NetworkDir: Lol
[2023-09-18T22:50:39] NetworkDir: Really vesc nice if this solved. I loved foc
[2023-09-18T22:51:07] NetworkDir: Smoth acceleration and stability
[2023-09-18T23:00:23] Eric Howat: I will need one of these configs myself üòÇ
[2023-09-18T23:00:38] Eric Howat: My entire goal is to upset a vsett10+ lmao
[2023-09-18T23:33:09] Eric Howat: I‚Äôll be trouble shooting all night now üòÅ
[2023-09-19T00:25:31] NetworkDir: vesc tool free with paid version diffrent or just for donate?
[2023-09-19T00:30:08] NetworkDir: full or mobile ? i confused
[2023-09-19T02:13:45] Alin Ciobanu: Are Rx and tx connected right?
[2023-09-19T02:32:34] Aaron E: I don't think these guys have a scooter dyno anyway üòÇ how tf would you even know?
[2023-09-19T03:33:25] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Mine died at 185A, so stay .. Below that
[2023-09-19T03:34:16] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Well, Alu PCB, normal variant idk
[2023-09-19T04:50:46] Eric Howat: So using adc1 for throttle and adc2 for regen but I‚Äôm not sure how to set it up because adc2 is throttle and adc1 is showing as regen in VESC tool, anyone know how to flip them?
[2023-09-19T05:44:49] Eric Howat: Also keep loosing front motor after setting up throttle which is weird
[2023-09-19T07:39:37] Mirono escooters: Physically swap
[2023-09-19T07:40:30] Eric Howat: That‚Äôs what I ended up doing, however I can‚Äôt seem to figure out the regen braking setting, just trying to use a 270x for regen and one for throttle as well can only get throttle to actively work
[2023-09-19T07:41:52] Mirono escooters: How come
[2023-09-19T07:42:02] Mirono escooters: Wich throttle settings
[2023-09-19T07:42:58] Eric Howat: <photos/photo_9784@19-09-2023_07-42-58.jpg>
[2023-09-19T07:43:04] Eric Howat: What should this be set too?
[2023-09-19T07:43:46] Mirono escooters: Current no reverse brake adc2
[2023-09-19T07:44:34] Eric Howat: I do that and it acts like regen automatically is applied when not on the throttle
[2023-09-19T07:45:02] Eric Howat: Should I invert the throttle I‚Äôm using in VESC tool?
[2023-09-19T08:17:41] Happy Giraffe: You gotta map adc inputs first
[2023-09-19T08:18:16] Happy Giraffe: Do it slowly and press brake, I got some surprises when it wanted to go
[2023-09-19T08:18:27] Eric Howat: Can you map in VESC mobile? I haven‚Äôt figured how to port to windows 10 yet without cord
[2023-09-19T08:19:16] Eric Howat: I just had it working actually, then lost the second channel and had to go back to normal. Makes no sense it just doesn‚Äôt show up at all after configuring throttle on current no reverse brake adc2
[2023-09-19T08:20:11] Happy Giraffe: Yes
[2023-09-19T08:20:30] Eric Howat: Car to explain? I‚Äôve been playing with this all night lol
[2023-09-19T08:20:33] Eric Howat: Care‚Äù
[2023-09-19T08:21:12] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_9785@19-09-2023_08-21-12.jpg>
[2023-09-19T08:21:12] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_9786@19-09-2023_08-21-12.jpg>
[2023-09-19T08:25:35] Eric Howat: <photos/photo_9787@19-09-2023_08-25-35.jpg>
[2023-09-19T08:25:43] Eric Howat: Yeah I‚Äôve been all good in there
[2023-09-19T08:26:21] Eric Howat: I loose the front motor every time lol
[2023-09-19T08:26:55] Eric Howat: For some reason it just stops seeing it
[2023-09-19T08:28:10] Eric Howat: But only when changing to Current no Reverse Brake ADC2 but mapped in just Current only mode then it works fine. Have to reset each time back to defaults to get the second Chanel back showing
[2023-09-19T08:30:13] Eric Howat: Otherwise throttle and regen work just it kicks me out of the second channel. Maybe it‚Äôs too much regen? I‚Äôm setting at like -35amps
[2023-09-19T13:59:33] Aaron E: that setting is only for throttles with a "spring return to center" function. like on my esk8 remote.
[2023-09-19T14:01:32] Aaron E: @Spintend_Varla the throttle needs to be mapped to BOTH ESCs over CAN bus. otherwise the throttle will only function on the ESC it's connected to
[2023-09-19T14:02:06] Aaron E: I forgot what tab it's under, but you have to write the parameter on both.
[2023-09-19T14:08:05] Eric Howat: I am writing to both escs, after switching to Current no Reverse Brake ADC2 I‚Äôm loosing even seeing the second channel in the canbus tab it‚Äôs a little strange lol
[2023-09-19T14:10:10] Aaron E: yeah that is weird. will it let you reconnect to the CAN bus ESC? or do you have to connect to it directly to communicate with it again?
[2023-09-19T14:10:40] Aaron E: you should come by today, or I'll stop by your place and help you iron things out.
[2023-09-19T14:10:43] Eric Howat: Nope. I actually have now had to reflash the firmwear to get both escs to show
[2023-09-19T14:10:50] Aaron E: damn
[2023-09-19T14:11:00] Aaron E: somethin' ain't right
[2023-09-19T14:11:19] Eric Howat: But yeah stop on by lol I can live without regen for now üòÇ I‚Äôm tryna ride this damn thing today lol
[2023-09-19T14:11:45] Eric Howat: <photos/photo_9789@19-09-2023_14-11-45.jpg>
[2023-09-19T14:11:50] Eric Howat: She all ready tho lol
[2023-09-19T14:37:25] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hello. a small issue with vesc erpm limit. when i set a limit, wheels in the air, no pb, it will reach the speed limit. but on the road, it will always be few km/h-erpm less. it's not a current/voltage issue since when i remove the erpm limit, it goes above the erpm i try to respect. i suspect the speed pid... but did anybody encounter this issue ?
[2023-09-19T15:19:15] Eric Howat: You the man James lol
[2023-09-19T17:58:39] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_9790@19-09-2023_17-58-39.jpg>
[2023-09-19T17:58:45] NetworkDir: Lol
[2023-09-19T17:58:52] NetworkDir: No hw limit time
[2023-09-19T18:29:48] Eric Howat: How do I make acceleration not ramp up slowly I want it as intense as possible lol
[2023-09-19T18:31:01] Oreo huzky: Throttle curve
[2023-09-19T18:33:34] Eric Howat: Okay cool
[2023-09-19T18:56:08] Eric Howat: What exactly am I changing in APP Config
[2023-09-19T20:28:49] Oreo huzky: Change the throttle expo to 30%
[2023-09-19T20:29:13] Oreo huzky: <photos/photo_9792@19-09-2023_20-29-13.jpg>
[2023-09-19T20:30:57] Oreo huzky: <photos/photo_9793@19-09-2023_20-30-57.jpg>
[2023-09-19T20:30:57] Oreo huzky: You can also lower the positive ramping time
[2023-09-19T20:33:49] Happy Giraffe: Depends if acceleration is slow even with full throttle
[2023-09-19T20:34:46] Eric Howat: Thanks y‚Äôall. I had James pop in and set it all up for me. Appreciate you taking the time to explain I deff put these screen shots in my VESC notes lol
[2023-09-19T20:34:47] Happy Giraffe: Positive ramp time 0.1s will fix most of it, other than that increasing phase amps will be about the only option
[2023-09-19T21:29:17] Eric Howat: Thanks y‚Äôall and especially James, got the 52v18ah junk varla to run 42.7mph ü§òüèª
[2023-09-19T21:29:25] Eric Howat: <photos/photo_9795@19-09-2023_21-29-25.jpg>

[2023-09-19T22:15:19] NetworkDir: Hmm
[2023-09-19T22:15:23] NetworkDir: I need more phase and fw
[2023-09-19T22:15:30] NetworkDir: But vesc limited
[2023-09-19T22:15:31] puneDir: Do you think g30 g1 can handle 30a fwk
[2023-09-19T22:15:37] NetworkDir: More phase can burn my esc
[2023-09-19T22:21:57] NetworkDir: Anyone know how much phase fine for makerbase 75100 ? With 120A phase / 40A batt Max my esc temp 47 degrees
[2023-09-19T22:28:50] puneDir: what about 200?
[2023-09-19T22:29:11] Mirono escooters: 150-160
[2023-09-19T22:29:29] Eric Howat: I‚Äôm at 190 6‚Äô3‚Äù tall

[2023-09-19T22:31:21] NetworkDir: For motors temp sensor ?
[2023-09-19T22:31:56] NetworkDir: Yea now i will be try no hw limit fw
[2023-09-19T22:32:11] NetworkDir: My motors very cold
[2023-09-19T22:32:14] puneDir: Its dual
[2023-09-19T22:32:18] NetworkDir: 16KHz
[2023-09-19T22:32:45] NetworkDir: Yes 25KHz and again i change back lol
[2023-09-19T22:32:56] NetworkDir: Idk
[2023-09-19T22:33:02] NetworkDir: 16Khz like better
[2023-09-19T22:33:04] puneDir: what would g30 g1 motor make with 20s+ 30a fwk +dual
[2023-09-19T22:33:07] puneDir: 90?
[2023-09-19T22:33:33] NetworkDir: Hmm okay
[2023-09-19T22:33:39] NetworkDir: I will set again to 25KHz
[2023-09-19T22:33:48] NetworkDir: And 150A phase 210A absolutely
[2023-09-19T22:34:09] NetworkDir: 25 fine
[2023-09-19T22:34:15] NetworkDir: Really my esc very cold
[2023-09-19T22:34:17] NetworkDir: I love it
[2023-09-19T22:34:59] NetworkDir: Makerbase new box and termal paste + orginal zero termal pads in up and down deck
[2023-09-19T22:37:24] puneDir: it makes 100+ in air with 30a fwk
[2023-09-19T23:02:52] Happy Giraffe: Can it be more like 30? I forgot already what the frequency changes essentially
[2023-09-19T23:07:54] Happy Giraffe: With oversized 3shul maybe you could run 40khz+? And enjoy cooler motors?
[2023-09-19T23:09:46] Happy Giraffe: Thats something interesting to try later, thursday gonna finish the batt box and hopefully get my torque arm piece that I gave to our cnc mill departmentüòÅ
[2023-09-19T23:12:45] Happy Giraffe: Current
[2023-09-19T23:12:58] Happy Giraffe: Will doüòÅ
[2023-09-19T23:20:45] Happy Giraffe: It was previously in same sized battery bag, now gotta find a way to nicely put vesc in there aswell (maybe dc converter aswell)
[2023-09-19T23:21:14] Happy Giraffe: Gotta protect the cables...üòÇüòÖ

[2023-09-19T23:28:07] Eric Howat: Anyone know why this pops up all the time?
[2023-09-19T23:34:25] NetworkDir: IOS version buggy
[2023-09-19T23:34:26] Eric Howat: Kind of figured lol
[2023-09-19T23:34:49] Eric Howat: I have a dedicated android I‚Äôm going to keep mounted so will see if that changes anything no big deal

[2023-09-20T00:09:02] Happy Giraffe: Works great, I could have also went for 48v direct on light and usb but wanted extra step of safety onboard as the 12v already did enough damage
[2023-09-20T00:09:31] Happy Giraffe: Scroll further 48v
[2023-09-20T00:09:37] Happy Giraffe: Ye its big
[2023-09-20T00:10:43] Happy Giraffe: Yup
[2023-09-20T00:16:31] NetworkDir: its ferofluid for hub motors? also how much ml's need per hub motors.
[2023-09-20T00:18:36] NetworkDir: nice
[2023-09-20T00:18:43] NetworkDir: now i try to find in turkiye lol
[2023-09-20T00:18:49] NetworkDir: little bit hard to fine
[2023-09-20T00:18:52] NetworkDir: but none use this
[2023-09-20T00:20:06] NetworkDir: "FUCKING CUSTOMS"
[2023-09-20T00:22:44] NetworkDir: You can order anything abroad but higher 150EUR have you have a problems also for lower 150EUR you must big money little bit it's complicated
[2023-09-20T00:22:59] NetworkDir: i found in amazon and can deliver to turkey
[2023-09-20T00:23:05] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_9807@20-09-2023_00-23-05.jpg>
[2023-09-20T00:23:08] NetworkDir: but price ü§ù
[2023-09-20T00:23:26] NetworkDir: 55$ for 10ml
[2023-09-20T00:25:26] NetworkDir: but for 2 motor hubs good 55$
[2023-09-20T00:25:33] NetworkDir: colder motor and more torque
[2023-09-20T00:25:52] NetworkDir: It's worth it I will buy in 1-2 months
[2023-09-20T00:28:10] NetworkDir: bad
[2023-09-20T00:28:31] NetworkDir: Inflation is very high
[2023-09-20T12:38:15] Happy Giraffe: I have that
[2023-09-20T12:38:37] Happy Giraffe: Worked so far nice quick charging phone and using high beams on light
[2023-09-20T12:40:49] Happy Giraffe: I lied, I have 48V/ 12v 10A version
[2023-09-20T12:41:14] Happy Giraffe: Max I ever pull is less than 60w so got double headroom
[2023-09-20T14:18:46] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Careful or you'll ruin the PARKETT BODEN

[2023-09-20T15:10:30] Gabe Enzo: what is the liquid
[2023-09-20T15:10:35] Gabe Enzo: Its probably vaseline or something
[2023-09-20T15:10:38] Gabe Enzo: Lmfao
[2023-09-20T15:11:22] Gabe Enzo: Oh shit nvm it's actual magnetic particles
[2023-09-20T15:55:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes I have noticed. I don't know why... and vesc does not let me know if it was successful or not
[2023-09-20T15:56:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes
[2023-09-20T15:56:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Well, that could work, but I'd rather check if there is any other way.
[2023-09-20T15:58:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Hm yeah I can look into it.
[2023-09-20T15:59:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yup. It's (good) that Vesc 6.05 takes so much time to get official, enough time to find issues...
[2023-09-20T16:01:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: The 6.0 had nothing to set profiles
[2023-09-20T16:02:03] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It only set locally
[2023-09-20T16:07:01] NetworkDir: @Spintend_Varla bro if possible send your motor photo (details)
[2023-09-20T16:07:10] NetworkDir: My motor

[2023-09-20T19:31:42] francois schempers: works great, and plenty of cable to passe data
[2023-09-20T19:32:45] Mirono escooters: But solid cable. can't move too much
[2023-09-20T19:35:22] francois schempers: surprisingly, it help a lot to passe through and solder, cable stay where you want
[2023-09-20T19:50:15] Mirono escooters: What? Almost every ethernet cable at work is solid core
[2023-09-20T19:50:20] Mirono escooters: That's just normal üôà
[2023-09-20T19:51:10] Mirono escooters: Never ever ever seen that
[2023-09-20T19:53:39] Mirono escooters: Never ever found
[2023-09-20T19:54:22] Happy Giraffe: My ethernet was solid, was afraid it would snap but it didntüòÖ
[2023-09-20T19:55:56] Mirono escooters: Then idk, we have boxes full at work, all solid

[2023-09-20T21:13:22] Happy Giraffe: Does anyone have any good keyed power switches for vesc?
[2023-09-20T22:20:29] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_9812@20-09-2023_22-20-29.jpg>
[2023-09-20T22:20:33] Mirono escooters: That's some power üò≥
[2023-09-20T22:27:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Thats just for single runs with minimal resource of fets crystal
[2023-09-20T22:48:47] Finn: I also had cat 6a with awg 24/7
[2023-09-20T22:49:01] Finn: But it was much thicer and had shielding i dont even need
[2023-09-20T22:49:28] Finn: Whaat
[2023-09-20T22:49:32] Finn: Sheesh
[2023-09-20T22:49:56] Finn: You also got the 200A version xd
[2023-09-20T22:52:12] Finn: My blade cant handle more then 170A phase so i guess its useless
[2023-09-20T23:03:04] NetworkDir: My problem not solved anyone have a idea ? 78km/h at air with 35A fwk
[2023-09-20T23:04:17] NetworkDir: Also i try to wheelie but rear motor cant go.
[2023-09-20T23:23:10] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_9814@20-09-2023_23-23-10.jpg>
[2023-09-20T23:24:49] NetworkDir: Nanrobot d6+ with this shit controller (28-28A) and ofc motor kV different but i use 35-40A and high phase + 35A FWK and my gps top speed 63kmhü§ï
[2023-09-20T23:27:15] NetworkDir: Yes in older configs hit to 150 kmh at air but now somethings wrong.
[2023-09-20T23:27:29] NetworkDir: Time to reset values and config againüî•
[2023-09-20T23:28:37] NetworkDir: Thanks
[2023-09-20T23:49:32] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Oh sry, i thought it was 85100 one with 6fet
[2023-09-20T23:53:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Get 60h üòè
[2023-09-21T02:52:35] Eric Howat: Felt like sharing I just ran a 15 mile trip (not conservative) on my 52v18.2ah battery x Ubox 75v100ax2j box and have 55% battery life left. VESC deff improved efficiency as I would normally be at like 25% battery life stock same trip lol
[2023-09-21T02:52:55] Eric Howat: And that‚Äôs going based upon voltage not the VESC tools estimation
[2023-09-21T03:26:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: Thats because Vsett use square wave for their controller, oldest and worst technology, but very cheap to produce
[2023-09-21T06:46:10] Finn: Maybe but in torque variant
[2023-09-21T06:56:00] puneDir: Try no hw limits
[2023-09-21T06:56:18] puneDir: wish i was able to buy your motors :(
[2023-09-21T09:31:51] NetworkDir: Yes but you get same torque or speed ? Same for me my battery performance little bit better
[2023-09-21T09:32:14] NetworkDir: If you get same torque and speed it‚Äôs amazing
[2023-09-21T12:29:42] NetworkDir: @Spintend_Varla Also your battery pack
[2023-09-21T12:29:47] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_9816@21-09-2023_12-29-47.jpg>
[2023-09-21T14:44:27] Konstantin: Heh... on rear motor hall probably die...vesc detect them... set motor to 100a. Try to start moving very...very slowly... motor construction 100a... heared like field moving, but motor didn't spin;)) if apply fast current, all ok. Set to sensorless mode, later will open motor. Mb this case 1esc to epic failureseseee xD
[2023-09-21T14:59:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs dual motor
[2023-09-21T15:07:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs used saying bullshit
[2023-09-21T15:07:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: People think it‚Äôs referring to single unit the stats
[2023-09-21T15:07:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: Me too at the first vesc :(
[2023-09-21T15:08:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Also dualtron motor would melt at this current
[2023-09-21T15:09:05] NetworkDir: At sensorless 51mph at air.
[2023-09-21T15:09:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: 260A battery would kill the 22x3 dualtron motor

[2023-09-21T15:10:06] Finn: too low
[2023-09-21T15:10:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not first time spintend share bullshit, they share too screenshot of who have 10kW max and 140kmh üòÖ
[2023-09-21T15:10:33] NetworkDir: How too low !?
[2023-09-21T15:10:35] Finn: also why you use fieldweaking 40A when your max battery current is 40A
[2023-09-21T15:11:06] NetworkDir: 5-40A same result
[2023-09-21T15:11:15] Finn: what speed you getting?
[2023-09-21T15:11:31] NetworkDir: On road max 63kmh at gps
[2023-09-21T15:11:39] Finn: nice
[2023-09-21T15:11:43] NetworkDir: Stock Controller 59kmh at gps too
[2023-09-21T15:11:46] Finn: what do you want to improve
[2023-09-21T15:11:50] NetworkDir: 25-25A shit wave

[2023-09-21T16:54:01] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Ye, if CAN connected between vescs then there are statuses in app tab. There you can sum stats or divide it for each esc

[2023-09-21T19:28:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: For real ?
[2023-09-21T19:29:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's simply impossible, even if it doesn't melt, with 16S battery, it can't take that much battery current, he should reach maximum speed before needing so much power
[2023-09-21T19:29:37] Eric Howat: Regen brake - Ubox v2 j do I wire brake light positive to return signal from brake to ADC2?
[2023-09-21T19:30:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: Come on, don't tell me that Numo is now ESC scooter maker...
[2023-09-21T19:42:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: I hope no
[2023-09-21T19:42:24] Face de Pin Suc√©: Same
[2023-09-21T19:42:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Numo is shit comparing to the actually engineering
[2023-09-21T19:42:46] Nik: I never said that, the front fork looks similar
[2023-09-21T19:42:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: They did a great work with world 1st quality material, now they get shit from Numo?üòÇ
[2023-09-21T19:43:20] Mirono escooters: Who's numo
[2023-09-21T19:43:20] Nik: probs just stole the design one of the two to the other
[2023-09-21T19:43:22] Mirono escooters: I'm confuse
[2023-09-21T19:43:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think he even don‚Äôt have hall, the extreme saturation would let controller explode because of impossible position tracking

[2023-09-21T19:50:38] Face de Pin Suc√©: Of course
[2023-09-21T19:50:44] Face de Pin Suc√©: Very bad scooters

[2023-09-21T19:51:20] Nik: I can't wait to see the front fork smashing in the concrete tbh
[2023-09-21T19:51:21] Face de Pin Suc√©: When cornering, front fork touch the ground
[2023-09-21T19:51:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: Not very stable
[2023-09-21T19:51:28] Face de Pin Suc√©: ...
[2023-09-21T19:51:32] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yeah exactly
[2023-09-21T19:51:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: It happened already
[2023-09-21T19:51:41] Face de Pin Suc√©: Not that hard haha
[2023-09-21T19:51:46] Nik: that's why I'm excited to see them race ü§£
[2023-09-21T19:51:56] Nik: I know, but they went with the suicide fork design brand
[2023-09-21T19:51:57] Face de Pin Suc√©: Will be much much fun hahaha
[2023-09-21T19:52:18] Face de Pin Suc√©: They should have gone with Rage Mechanics true performance racing scooters üòá
[2023-09-21T19:52:41] Nik: who the hell thought that a pointy angled tip facing the ground was a good idea on that thing, I really can't get it
[2023-09-21T19:53:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: furthermore when you see it moving x)
[2023-09-21T19:53:27] Nik: some boyueda design flaws type of things üòÇ
[2023-09-21T19:53:50] Nik: this video makes me laugh so much every time ü§£
[2023-09-21T19:56:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: No traction controll for turns
[2023-09-21T19:56:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs good only for long straight tracks
[2023-09-21T19:56:37] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes
[2023-09-21T19:56:45] Face de Pin Suc√©: Have you seen their performances on circuit ?
[2023-09-21T19:56:56] Face de Pin Suc√©: Not even 140Kmh on 1km long straight
[2023-09-21T19:57:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: We reach 153Kmh GPS in less than 500m straight hahaha
[2023-09-21T20:00:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: Even mantis with 10 inch motor and 6p battery does it fast
[2023-09-21T20:03:18] Face de Pin Suc√©: x)
[2023-09-21T20:04:34] Oreo huzky: Tf
[2023-09-21T20:04:45] Oreo huzky: I have same fork üíÄ
[2023-09-21T20:05:02] Nik: good luck mate ü§£üòÇ
[2023-09-21T20:05:29] Oreo huzky: With 20kw on each wheel
[2023-09-21T20:05:43] Oreo huzky: It handled 15kw well
[2023-09-21T20:05:51] Mirono escooters: OMG WTF
[2023-09-21T20:05:56] Mirono escooters: That's so poorly castedüôàüôà
[2023-09-21T20:06:10] Oreo huzky: Other than that I needed to make the nuts really tight
[2023-09-21T20:06:54] Mirono escooters: No kink judgement here
[2023-09-21T20:07:06] Oreo huzky: bruh
[2023-09-21T20:08:10] Mirono escooters: Id upgrade that fork
[2023-09-21T20:08:21] Oreo huzky: Nah to lazy
[2023-09-21T20:09:01] Mirono escooters: Kissing tarmac at 120 isnt fun
[2023-09-21T20:09:47] Oreo huzky: Yes because it‚Äôs very fun
[2023-09-21T20:10:33] Oreo huzky: <sticker>
[2023-09-21T23:38:25] Gabe Enzo: my kugoo G4 has a shite front suspension
[2023-09-21T23:39:07] Gabe Enzo: Its one of those Z shaped types.
[2023-09-21T23:39:18] Gabe Enzo: you can feel It clatter
[2023-09-21T23:39:23] Gabe Enzo: Its a spring system. Ew.
[2023-09-21T23:40:22] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_9826@21-09-2023_23-40-22.jpg>
[2023-09-21T23:44:07] Face de Pin Suc√©: Damn
[2023-09-22T09:11:48] Mirono escooters: Springs are fine
[2023-09-22T09:56:15] Ofek üê•: On kuugo g-booster after the rubber wear out, a guy decided to replace the original suspension with a spring. Looks pretty funny, but he says it's a great ride
[2023-09-22T10:04:43] Mirono escooters: Rubber?
[2023-09-22T10:04:47] Mirono escooters: Problably works, but looks ugly
[2023-09-22T10:05:38] Ofek üê•: The stock suspension is like dualtron/Inokim
[2023-09-22T10:06:11] Mirono escooters: Can you explain? üôà
[2023-09-22T10:06:18] Mirono escooters: It just uses rubber to suspend on?
[2023-09-22T10:10:52] Ofek üê•: The original suspension have rubber inside a block and the axle is passthrough the middle, this gives a nice suspension. (Until the rubber wear out)
[2023-09-22T10:11:26] Ofek üê•: It sits inside a block
[2023-09-22T10:12:37] Mirono escooters: Ohh
[2023-09-22T10:12:42] Mirono escooters: And he didn't replace the rubber?
[2023-09-22T10:12:47] Mirono escooters: Smart concept, problably wears quickly
[2023-09-22T10:13:44] Ofek üê•: No.. Just added this shock üòÖ I saw ton of people inserting dualtron suspension cartridges into them üòÇ
[2023-09-22T18:53:52] Simone: Numo use 7218s?
[2023-09-22T18:54:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: Si
[2023-09-22T18:55:01] Simone: I haven't seen videos on the track of how it goes honestly...
[2023-09-22T18:55:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because the torque is very slow
[2023-09-22T18:55:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: 200a peak with high speed motors
[2023-09-22T18:55:53] Simone: but I saw the telemetry of Sib's scooter... it's true that it reaches 153 on the track but it comes from a big bend at 90kmh...
[2023-09-22T18:56:50] Simone: it's not such an impressive result... at least it doesn't make me cry it's a miracle
[2023-09-22T18:57:01] Simone: fast for sure...but not impossible to match
[2023-09-22T19:01:54] NetworkDir: In vesc ABS_OVERCURRENT_ERROR for what value ?
[2023-09-22T19:01:59] Jan: I think its impressive, not just hitting that speed but to be also reliable enough to use it on a track lap after lap
[2023-09-22T19:02:48] Jan: What remains is the same issue you also have in the car industry. If you only go performance, there will be always someone faster and powerful to come. To make it a timeless piece it has to be more than that.
[2023-09-22T19:04:51] NetworkDir: At full throttle motor power cuts and on vesc rt i see this fault code
[2023-09-22T19:07:27] Simone: that's the skill of whoever drives it...you could give it to someone else and in the same spot it wouldn't even reach 135...or worse wooble and straight into the gravel
[2023-09-22T20:01:49] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes
[2023-09-22T20:02:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: Look at the straight after, from 50 to 145Kmh ;)
[2023-09-22T20:03:19] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes exactly, we could be faster, more torque, but those scooters were made to be beasts on track circuit, not for drag race or max speed
[2023-09-22T20:04:02] Face de Pin Suc√©: I don't agree with you, yes the pilot is great, but those scooters are truly well thought for performance on track
[2023-09-22T20:05:01] francois schempers: your absolute current is set too low and at full throttle it spike above what you setted, that's what I think happens
[2023-09-22T22:59:47] JPPL: Saying 150kph is normal on escooter is not normal
[2023-09-22T23:06:03] Face de Pin Suc√©: ??
[2023-09-22T23:06:12] Happy Giraffe: They are french=crazy baguettesüòÖ
[2023-09-22T23:06:29] Happy Giraffe: I love the research and development our guys have done!üëç
[2023-09-22T23:06:52] Happy Giraffe: Sadly only scooter stuff and not ebikeüåö

[2023-09-22T23:08:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: But escooter races took us too much time
[2023-09-22T23:19:20] Face de Pin Suc√©: If anyone need a C700 üòã
[2023-09-22T23:19:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: I also have a CL700 in stock
[2023-09-22T23:19:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: <video_file>
[2023-09-22T23:19:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: <video_file>
[2023-09-22T23:20:01] NetworkDir: Actually with 150A phase and 210A absolute phase It‚Äôs mean i need more absolute phase
[2023-09-22T23:21:43] Happy Giraffe: Oh, mid drive hub?üòÅ Similar to Vector Vortex thay has QS205 there
[2023-09-22T23:23:14] Happy Giraffe: If you can custom make larger diameter motor than QS205 and make it 50H and fit 135mm dropouts Im in love
[2023-09-22T23:23:22] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-09-22T23:24:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: No hub, IPM motor, crazy motor
[2023-09-22T23:24:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: I don't like mid drive hub, for me it's a nonsense
[2023-09-22T23:25:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: This IPM gives only 2mOhm, you can push as much as you want
[2023-09-22T23:25:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: Even a C700 is not enough to make it hot
[2023-09-22T23:25:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: Sotion motor came after, didn't tested it yet
[2023-09-22T23:27:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes
[2023-09-22T23:27:58] Happy Giraffe: I want, I want!
[2023-09-22T23:28:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: I prefer escooters haha
[2023-09-22T23:28:36] Happy Giraffe: Lightning rods is similar but has tiny phase cables. Guy is an old grumpy who develops it so could push more ampsüåö
[2023-09-22T23:29:02] Oreo huzky: Based
[2023-09-22T23:29:21] Happy Giraffe: Really fast spinning motor and two stage gear sprocket reduction‚ù§Ô∏è
[2023-09-22T23:29:29] Oreo huzky: For scooter
[2023-09-22T23:30:03] Face de Pin Suc√©: I don't really know
[2023-09-22T23:30:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: Not really, but we never take the surron honestly
[2023-09-22T23:30:55] Happy Giraffe: LR motor would be easier on frame and dropouts as chain is much higher speed
[2023-09-22T23:31:31] Happy Giraffe: But dream is to buy 50CC Derbi DRD with broken motor and put QS138 90H thereüòÇ
[2023-09-22T23:31:51] Happy Giraffe: Bit different
[2023-09-22T23:31:58] Happy Giraffe: Might be
[2023-09-22T23:32:45] Happy Giraffe: Yeah that's most critical part, and if I wanna have two chains at the same time
[2023-09-22T23:33:45] Happy Giraffe: But the QS Derbi would be fire, pulling next to 500cc and smoking them off from lightsüòÇ
[2023-09-23T00:52:55] JPPL: 150 is out of normal speeds and riders on escooters this are Top world records, normally records are not normal/common, this speed is abnormal, rare! üíãüòö
[2023-09-23T01:04:02] Oreo huzky: When I have to be at work at 8:00 but I left home at 07:99
[2023-09-23T01:17:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: Arrived new c350?
[2023-09-23T01:21:49] JPPL: 7.59 üòçüòÇ
[2023-09-23T01:22:02] Oreo huzky: Cl350 will arrive soon
[2023-09-23T01:22:11] Oreo huzky: Next week
[2023-09-23T01:49:51] JPPL: New AntBms till 24s 340a cont and 850 peak
[2023-09-23T01:50:03] JPPL: Other variations also till 30s
[2023-09-23T01:52:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes but giantüòÖ
[2023-09-23T01:54:01] JPPL: Theres better?
[2023-09-23T01:54:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_9830@23-09-2023_01-54-01.jpg>
[2023-09-23T01:54:13] JPPL: Not so big
[2023-09-23T01:54:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: No but not useful for our scooter
[2023-09-23T01:54:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs good for motorcycle or storage system where requires big continuos current
[2023-09-23T01:54:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: And for such current I would use something with rel√®
[2023-09-23T01:55:32] JPPL: They have that version also
[2023-09-23T02:18:42] Oreo huzky: Can the standard cl350 battery plugs handle 200A?
[2023-09-23T02:21:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: Plug yes, controller I think not so
[2023-09-23T02:21:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: C350 maybe yes, but cl350 mhhh
[2023-09-23T02:34:50] Oreo huzky: But 150A would be okay right? At 30s
[2023-09-23T02:35:35] Oreo huzky: It‚Äôs just for peaks
[2023-09-23T02:39:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt know
[2023-09-23T06:25:14] Nick: <photos/photo_9831@23-09-2023_06-25-14.jpg>
[2023-09-23T06:26:09] Nick: Question, I fudged my first solder, had to cut one phase shorter to fix it (was learning to solder onto the 8mm bullets). It's all super solid now but does the length matter at all?
[2023-09-23T06:56:42] RS: Certainly! shorter wires length = better.
[2023-09-23T07:18:40] Nick: Does them being different matter?
[2023-09-23T09:35:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: CL350 is up to 180A battery
[2023-09-23T11:22:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No
[2023-09-23T11:57:26] puneDir: <photos/photo_9832@23-09-2023_11-57-26.jpg>
[2023-09-23T11:57:36] puneDir: Is this motor good
[2023-09-23T12:14:34] Oreo huzky: Nice
[2023-09-23T12:40:07] Jan: 34mOhm seems a bit on the higher side but really depends on the motor
[2023-09-23T12:40:23] puneDir: Z10x motor
[2023-09-23T12:40:32] Jan: How is the winding?
[2023-09-23T12:40:40] puneDir: Idk
[2023-09-23T12:40:51] puneDir: Elsan says its slower than g30 motor
[2023-09-23T12:43:24] NetworkDir: My vesc slower not motor
[2023-09-23T12:43:37] NetworkDir: Software issue
[2023-09-23T12:45:50] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_9833@23-09-2023_12-45-50.jpg>
[2023-09-23T12:54:10] Jan: 16x4?
[2023-09-23T12:55:59] puneDir: Give it to me
[2023-09-23T12:58:23] Simone: I'd like to overcome the 160 wall...unfortunately we need the right path to do it "safely"
[2023-09-23T12:58:50] NetworkDir: idk but 30 poles and 50mm magnets
[2023-09-23T12:59:44] puneDir: my record is 75 with pro2
[2023-09-23T12:59:58] puneDir: actually Orkun did that
[2023-09-23T13:00:05] puneDir: I only did 63
[2023-09-23T13:00:11] Gabe Enzo: me 70 with one motor.
[2023-09-23T13:00:16] Gabe Enzo: stock
[2023-09-23T13:00:23] puneDir: whats ur weight
[2023-09-23T13:00:28] Gabe Enzo: Plane runway.
[2023-09-23T13:00:31] Gabe Enzo: 66
[2023-09-23T13:00:36] puneDir: Nice im 93
[2023-09-23T13:00:45] Gabe Enzo: 63kmh is impressive
[2023-09-23T13:00:48] Gabe Enzo: for that weight
[2023-09-23T13:01:03] puneDir: yeah with 30a discharge
[2023-09-23T13:10:48] Jan: One would need to know the windings to determine if its ok, i cant say.
[2023-09-23T13:19:10] Simone: My 154 üòÅ
[2023-09-23T13:35:03] Nick: Hey so this battery will be QS 8, just wondering for charging do I just need to get a 72v charger and solder a qs8 connector instead of a barrel or whatever or can you just buy them ready made?
[2023-09-23T13:35:44] Nick: <photos/photo_9834@23-09-2023_13-35-44.jpg>
[2023-09-23T14:06:19] Happy Giraffe: I hope that fuse is for charging
[2023-09-23T14:07:13] Happy Giraffe: Typically this type of fuse has worst quality cables that have the silicone/plastic rated at beloe 100¬∞c
[2023-09-23T14:07:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Very clean, I like.
[2023-09-23T14:07:34] Nick: Skyart built it but I have to figure out the charging
[2023-09-23T14:08:05] Nick: The idea me and him talked about was quick connect qs8 so I could take the battery in and out if it's too cold
[2023-09-23T14:08:28] Nick: So it should charge via that
[2023-09-23T14:09:00] Nick: And xt90 to the ubox
[2023-09-23T14:09:41] Nick: This man is a master of his craft check it
[2023-09-23T14:09:49] Nick: <photos/photo_9835@23-09-2023_14-09-49.jpg>
[2023-09-23T14:13:28] Nick: The prob I have though is do I just buy a 72v charger and cannibalize it or can I get qs8 to charging connector adapters
[2023-09-23T14:19:26] Nick: I'm not gonna run it over 90a probably to start
[2023-09-23T14:20:16] Nick: Idk about batteries much which one is the fuse?
[2023-09-23T14:20:24] Nick: I thought the black things were qs8
[2023-09-23T14:20:41] NetworkDir: yes 35A fuses max can handle 50-55A and more currents probaly bang
[2023-09-23T14:20:58] Finn: Why fuse
[2023-09-23T14:21:21] Happy Giraffe: Problem is those fuseboxes have bad quality cables if used for discharge
[2023-09-23T14:21:21] Nick: He said the vesc will handle discharge well enough
[2023-09-23T14:21:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: If bms fail then fuse , but if you do good job and use good bms, you don‚Äôt need
[2023-09-23T14:21:29] NetworkDir: prevent fireworks if shit bms
[2023-09-23T14:21:32] Finn: Yrah
[2023-09-23T14:21:42] Finn: Bro just buy quality bmsüíÄ
[2023-09-23T14:21:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: Like Kaabo wolf
[2023-09-23T14:21:48] Finn: Instead use fuse
[2023-09-23T14:22:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: Catch fire always even with bms , so their fix was fuse
[2023-09-23T14:22:20] NetworkDir: Kaboo wolf king gt burns for shit bms?
[2023-09-23T14:22:29] NetworkDir: lmfao
[2023-09-23T14:22:33] Nick: He said BMS is bypassed
[2023-09-23T14:22:41] Nick: For dischaege
[2023-09-23T14:22:51] Happy Giraffe: It's similar, 14awg and 105¬∞c plastic housing
[2023-09-23T14:22:52] Finn: Best fixüíÄ
[2023-09-23T14:23:11] Nick: <photos/photo_9838@23-09-2023_14-23-11.jpg>
[2023-09-23T14:23:15] Finn: Then you need really slow fuse
[2023-09-23T14:23:35] Finn: Tff
[2023-09-23T14:23:41] NetworkDir: <sticker>
[2023-09-23T14:23:43] Finn: This dude aint knowing shit
[2023-09-23T14:24:15] Happy Giraffe: Using smaller, bypassed bmsüåö
[2023-09-23T14:24:36] Nick: Idk lol I know nothing about batteries
[2023-09-23T14:25:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: No, he‚Äôs right but only if you‚Äôre pro user
[2023-09-23T14:25:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you don‚Äôt know anything like him maybe better not
[2023-09-23T14:25:17] Finn: This mf saves money instead of investing 20‚Ç¨ more in better security or quality of bms
[2023-09-23T14:25:29] francois schempers: it's not a question of size, even √† 150A bms can fit that, he is just cheaping out to gain on marging
[2023-09-23T14:25:36] Finn: What about shorting the discharge pin
[2023-09-23T14:25:40] Finn: Then youre fucked
[2023-09-23T14:25:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: Fuse
[2023-09-23T14:25:56] Finn: And if you wanna use with fuse nice. More resistance
[2023-09-23T14:26:03] Nick: So am I being shipped a bomb basically
[2023-09-23T14:26:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you use bms, you‚Äôve against more resistanceüòÇ
[2023-09-23T14:26:47] Finn: Fuse is still shit
[2023-09-23T14:26:48] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_9839@23-09-2023_14-26-48.jpg>
[2023-09-23T14:27:00] Finn: Thats high quality bomb
[2023-09-23T14:27:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: His fuse maybe yes, but not every fuse
[2023-09-23T14:27:21] Finn: 1s10p?üíÄ
[2023-09-23T14:27:43] Finn: <photos/photo_9840@23-09-2023_14-27-43.jpg>
[2023-09-23T14:28:20] Finn: Also if bms wires fail its over
[2023-09-23T14:28:39] Finn: Happend to me before bc i bridged under the bms the balancer pins for easier wiring
[2023-09-23T14:28:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: Fuse is safer than bms
[2023-09-23T14:28:54] Finn: And forgot to remove it for different battery
[2023-09-23T14:28:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: For short protection
[2023-09-23T14:29:12] Finn: Does there even 100A fuse exist?
[2023-09-23T14:29:16] NetworkDir: yes
[2023-09-23T14:29:16] Nick: I'm so confused so is it going to blow up if I put more than 40a
[2023-09-23T14:29:17] Finn: And holder for that
[2023-09-23T14:29:24] Finn: Nah
[2023-09-23T14:29:26] Finn: What cells did he use
[2023-09-23T14:29:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: I use 2 x 150a
[2023-09-23T14:29:33] Nick: 50e
[2023-09-23T14:29:35] francois schempers: tell him to not bypass shit and use a proper bms, your not an amateur, your a pro user that want the full capacity of your cell, if you want more discharge later down the road, with a proper bms you can, here he is limiting you to the fuse capacity, so in other terms you could buy two stock xiaomi batteries, put them in serie and you would have the same output. if you want fully custom batteries, you better gain from going that road
[2023-09-23T14:29:49] Finn: What config
[2023-09-23T14:29:57] Finn: You got photo
[2023-09-23T14:30:03] Nick: 20s7p
[2023-09-23T14:30:08] Nick: One sec got photos
[2023-09-23T14:30:21] Finn: So 70A max discharge from all cells
[2023-09-23T14:30:40] Finn: If you go over that your cells start to heat up
[2023-09-23T14:30:41] NetworkDir: Fuck any fuse and bms's help me for vesc
[2023-09-23T14:30:42] NetworkDir: lol
[2023-09-23T14:30:48] Nick: He said to not pull more than 90 specifically so I had thought that was my cieling
[2023-09-23T14:31:05] Finn: Nah 50e rated for 10A max
[2023-09-23T14:31:16] Finn: 7*10=70A Max amps of batt
[2023-09-23T14:31:25] Finn: If you go over it starts heating up
[2023-09-23T14:31:43] francois schempers: you can still pull more than that safely, you'll just have bigger Vdrop and more heat
[2023-09-23T14:31:50] Finn: Yeah i know
[2023-09-23T14:31:57] Finn: Its just the safe limit
[2023-09-23T14:32:07] Finn: If theres no bms to shut the output when overheating
[2023-09-23T14:32:30] francois schempers: maybe a bms with a temp prob ?
[2023-09-23T14:32:31] Nick: So I could maybe have a quick burst of like 80 and back to like 65 to cool down? The old controller in this thing had 35a only and it still got the bike to about 70kmh
[2023-09-23T14:32:40] Finn: He has a bms for charge
[2023-09-23T14:32:43] Finn: Not for discharge
[2023-09-23T14:32:46] Finn: Scroll up
[2023-09-23T14:32:51] Finn: .
[2023-09-23T14:32:58] Finn: Only fuse
[2023-09-23T14:33:18] Oreo huzky: Bro
[2023-09-23T14:33:40] Nick: I just don't wanna blow my house up putting this thing together
[2023-09-23T14:33:40] Finn: Sure theres time a big factor
[2023-09-23T14:33:45] Nick: Or myself while riding it
[2023-09-23T14:34:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: It won‚Äôt happen , but I‚Äôm worried about discharging under voltage
[2023-09-23T14:34:36] francois schempers: https://a.aliexpress.com/_EzZgeZp
[2023-09-23T14:34:53] NetworkDir: or smart ant bms aliexpress.com/item/1005004384140905.html
[2023-09-23T14:35:03] francois schempers: look at the price, i really don't understand why he doesn't use a proper bms
[2023-09-23T14:35:30] Nick: <photos/photo_9841@23-09-2023_14-35-30.jpg>
[2023-09-23T14:36:33] Finn: The whole point of that bms is just weiered
[2023-09-23T14:36:35] Nick: <photos/photo_9842@23-09-2023_14-36-35.jpg>
[2023-09-23T14:36:53] francois schempers: it's not that much bigger, and he is using Z space anyway so it can't fit in a smaller space. just put it in the other direction and voila
[2023-09-23T14:37:40] Nick: I do have a 120a xt90 fuse
[2023-09-23T14:37:46] Nick: Would that help at all
[2023-09-23T14:38:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: So it‚Äôs fused
[2023-09-23T14:38:20] Nick: Yeah they sent it along with the controller
[2023-09-23T14:38:24] Nick: I have 2 actually
[2023-09-23T14:38:40] Nick: I didn't know if I'd need them but it sounds like that might be useful
[2023-09-23T14:39:35] francois schempers: but at 120A not safe for overheating, does the Vesc have a ntc connection to monitor temps
[2023-09-23T14:40:04] Nick: <photos/photo_9844@23-09-2023_14-40-04.jpg>
[2023-09-23T14:40:15] Nick: Connect to this or to the actual qs8?
[2023-09-23T14:41:19] Nick: Kk so I'll do qs8 to xt90 and then run to VESC, then the stock xt90 is my charger
[2023-09-23T14:41:25] Nick: Unless he did it the other way around
[2023-09-23T14:41:27] Nick: Idk
[2023-09-23T14:41:41] Nick: I asked to have qs8 so I could charge it inside
[2023-09-23T14:41:52] Nick: And then connect it to the bike when I wanna ride
[2023-09-23T14:43:56] Nick: Maybe xt90 is discharge and qs8 is charger
[2023-09-23T14:47:58] francois schempers: I looked it up, the seller as a 2cm longer version that can handle 200A current, so when he say it is to save space, its more a matter of saving money, he should be honest about that, I can cut corner if he is clear about it and you're okey with it
[2023-09-23T14:49:24] francois schempers: the 20S 100A is 60‚Ç¨
[2023-09-23T14:49:33] francois schempers: https://www.lithiumbatterypcb.com/product/20s-or-24s-li-ion-lifepo4-smart-bluetooth-bms-for-60v-72v-84v-battery-with-uart-rs485-can-communication-100a-150a-200a-constant-current/
[2023-09-23T14:51:20] francois schempers: the one he use is 50‚Ç¨, he maybe bought it in higher quantity, they do reduction in bulk, and he use it anywhere it remotely fits
[2023-09-23T14:53:29] francois schempers: anyway for a 20s7p of samsung 50E, your paying quite a price I can imagine, and for that price personally I would prefer something that was ment to be together
[2023-09-23T14:55:12] Nick: Yeah I think I'm kinda just stuck with whatever I get now unfortunately so if it's screwed so am I lol
[2023-09-23T14:55:36] Nick: Think it was shipped last night
[2023-09-23T14:56:44] Nick: If I buy insulated gloves can I just re do all the connectors ?
[2023-09-23T15:01:04] Nick: Idk whatever ones don't work
[2023-09-23T15:02:32] Nick: It'll be able to do 70a or would that break it?
[2023-09-23T15:03:23] francois schempers: you mean change the bms yourself ? if you're not used to work with live wire you'll have a high chance to fry something
[2023-09-23T15:03:46] Nick: I was thinking wearing oven mitts andna pair of scissors
[2023-09-23T15:03:51] Nick: But that sounds smarter
[2023-09-23T15:04:14] Nick: Basically just remove the fuse because it sounded like that was the primary issue
[2023-09-23T15:04:19] francois schempers: you'll be good with the correct fuse,
[2023-09-23T15:05:43] Nick: I get that for the short but it sounded like I'd only get 50a because the black fuse would burn out above that amount
[2023-09-23T15:05:48] francois schempers: if that's the correct way, better ask confirmation on wich is charge and wich is discharge
[2023-09-23T15:06:36] Nick: Oh! Gotcha. So it's just safety being added for the output
[2023-09-23T15:06:47] Nick: I barely grasp this sorry lol
[2023-09-23T15:07:00] Nick: Just getting done a 12h shift
[2023-09-23T15:07:51] Nick: I think at some point I did tell him I had the fuses so maybe he's just saving me paying him however much for those
[2023-09-23T15:10:03] Nick: So 90a is back on the table?
[2023-09-23T15:10:15] Nick: I'd like to blow up the motor if anything's gonna go lmao
[2023-09-23T15:13:31] Nick: I can't wait. I'm looking at a QS260 and it'd be cool to send off the old motor by doing a burnout until the hub motor turns red
[2023-09-23T15:15:40] Mirono escooters: But why :(
[2023-09-23T15:15:59] Nick: <photos/photo_9845@23-09-2023_15-15-59.jpg>
[2023-09-23T15:17:20] Nick: It's probably good for way more than 500 but unless it impresses me when the bike has its battery I may or may not do the ultimate tire popping pavement damaging burnout
[2023-09-23T15:18:48] Nick: Problem is it's a wierd size it's 12in not counting tire
[2023-09-23T15:20:11] francois schempers: you could go for something like that https://rage-mechanics.com/moteurs-trottinettes-/1407-moteur-fhs60.html

[2023-09-23T15:26:39] Gabe Enzo: how's your project?
[2023-09-23T15:27:24] Gabe Enzo: What's the motor rim size?
[2023-09-23T15:28:04] Gabe Enzo: What tape is that? I NEED it.
[2023-09-23T15:34:32] Nick: <photos/photo_9846@23-09-2023_15-34-32.jpg>
[2023-09-23T15:34:54] Nick: So far all I've really done is adapted the wierd Kelly connector looking things to jst
[2023-09-23T15:35:42] Nick: Waiting on battery so I can make the drivetrain work and after that the lights and signals and alarm will be connected up

[2023-09-23T19:13:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I will try to send them in a single CAN-cmd, maybe it helps. If not I have to loop them or add a can function specifically for this case. Ah right, I wanted to check how VESC Tool does it, lemme check.
[2023-09-23T19:15:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and maybe the can-list-devs function is buggy, but last time I checked it always found all my CAN devices and looped through them.
[2023-09-23T19:20:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Too bad there is no way to check if comm_can_send_buffer was successful.,
[2023-09-23T19:21:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @jamessoderstrom But besides that issue everything else works?
[2023-09-23T19:27:11] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Good.
[2023-09-23T19:27:48] Jason Nelson: Can someone tell me if the max current of 120a on the 75100 aluminum base is for battery amps or both battery and phase?
[2023-09-23T19:28:08] Jason Nelson: I cannot find details specifically pertaining to phase amps online
[2023-09-23T19:28:50] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: great xd
[2023-09-23T19:29:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Because you say it works on AK script, it might have something to do with running it all at once, I have now added a set-param function as well which will set param locally and then do the CAN devices, step by step for each parameter.
[2023-09-23T19:30:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: If this not works I will try the other idea.
[2023-09-23T19:30:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: also fixed this safety risk: https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/issues/655
[2023-09-23T19:34:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: This was not really an issue for the dash script because it does not let you disable the scooter while driving anyway, BUT, still making sure...

[2023-09-24T10:15:33] cihan: Hello all, I've just joined the group and reading past messages. I have a sluggish navee n65 and I would like to make it faster. Changing firmware is unfortunately impossible and I would prefer a FOC controller after reading about it a little bit. The reason I prefer FOC is I mostly ride on plain ground and I would benefit from field weakening. I don't want to spend much but I can go up to 200 USD if it's going to be beneficial. I feel like I'll only use the controller with Navee n65 since on long term I aim for Segway GT2 and I won't want to modify it's own controller. Which controller should I get? Is Makerbase 60100 a good option against 75200? I saw one message about that.
[2023-09-24T10:20:55] Happy Giraffe: My first batch single ubox also ripüòÇ
[2023-09-24T10:30:17] francois schempers: with what kind of battery will it be paired ? max output, what voltage ? and what is the motor capable of ?
[2023-09-24T11:05:02] cihan: Battery is 48V, 13s5p, 12500mAh. Battery has its own BMS on it though it probably doesn't balance at all but it's OK, I can balance myself time to time. Motor is rated 500W nominal, 900W max. But I can probably push it to 1500W for very short times when I need for like 10 seconds most if back EMF is lower than battery voltage.
[2023-09-24T11:07:39] cihan: I read lots of VESC controller failures here, what's the main reason of it? Extreme heat during usual operation or unexpected current ramp up without user's fault?

[2023-09-24T11:32:39] francois schempers: this one is good value if you're battery can't handle too much current, you'll have the most of what your hardware can do https://spintend.com/products/single-ubox-aluminum-controller-80v-100a-based-on-vesc if your battery can handle it, you can go for this one, still near your budget https://spintend.com/products/copy-of-single-ubox-aluminum-controller-80v-100a-based-on-vesc and if you plan to make a monster an change everything else, you have this, out of the budget though https://rage-mechanics.com/controleurs/24-c350.html

[2023-09-24T11:34:18] puneDir: Navee n65 has nearly no balance with shit cells
[2023-09-24T11:34:36] puneDir: cmon flipsky is good
[2023-09-24T11:34:43] puneDir: dont say that it has emotions :(
[2023-09-24T11:34:53] NetworkDir: He max can get 48V 20A from battery pack
[2023-09-24T11:35:10] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_9868@24-09-2023_11-35-10.jpg>
[2023-09-24T11:35:18] NetworkDir: Orginal controller 18AüòÇ
[2023-09-24T11:35:34] francois schempers: original bms may handle more though
[2023-09-24T11:35:49] NetworkDir: Yep but cells really have a bad quality
[2023-09-24T11:36:53] NetworkDir: This controller limited 25kmh I think he need alternative controller Smallest vesc fine for this
[2023-09-24T11:37:03] francois schempers: then the first investment shouldn't be in the controller ^^ because Vesc with less than 20A on battery current is gonna heat up a shit ton more with high phase current if he want torque
[2023-09-24T11:37:07] NetworkDir: What cheap and smaller version at vesc
[2023-09-24T11:37:46] francois schempers: ahh max speed is more important than torque ? my first link should do the trick, and give a little headroom for when he change those battery
[2023-09-24T11:38:27] NetworkDir: Ubox 80v 100A ?
[2023-09-24T11:39:00] NetworkDir: I think makerbase 75100 fine Low current low voltage
[2023-09-24T11:39:14] francois schempers: yeah, he can't later change the battery pack for a more capable one with more voltage/current
[2023-09-24T11:39:35] francois schempers: true, but it's money wasted the second he change that battery
[2023-09-24T11:40:03] NetworkDir: Sure but frame and motors max power 20-22A More voltages can burn motor
[2023-09-24T11:40:08] NetworkDir: He need new scooter
[2023-09-24T11:40:18] francois schempers: that's also true üòÇ
[2023-09-24T11:40:55] francois schempers: but he can buy a good frame for cheap, and then, again, he wouldn't need to change controller down the road
[2023-09-24T11:42:07] francois schempers: some guy bought a g30 frame for 60‚Ç¨ I think with some reasonable research you can find similar deals
[2023-09-24T11:42:39] Happy Giraffe: Mine was user error, 12v cable snapped into a grounded frame partüòÅ so far did 12,000km on that vesc so very reliable
[2023-09-24T12:11:53] Gabe Enzo: lucky bastard
[2023-09-24T12:13:00] cihan: I'm not sure about BMS, at least 900W I can only say. For cells, C/2 discharge rate should be OK, so it will be over 2000W but I don't know what BMS allows, I need to test it myself since there's no datasheet available for it. It's already fine to get 900W from battery for me, it's already max power of the motor and I won't even want to use it at 900W continuously.
[2023-09-24T12:16:33] cihan: Thank you for your recommendations. 30A is already more than enough for me. Do you recommend higher current controller for more headroom to be futureproof and for more mosfets for better heat dissipation?
[2023-09-24T12:17:06] cihan: Should I stay away from any Flipsky model for reliability?
[2023-09-24T12:19:31] francois schempers: 30A usage on a 100A controller leave plenty of headroom, but more importantly, you need propre cooling, so a good contact with the frame with thermal paste, then you should be golden

[2023-09-24T12:20:00] francois schempers: <photos/photo_9870@24-09-2023_12-20-00.jpg>
[2023-09-24T12:21:31] cihan: I haven't opened the deck to check the cell voltages yet. But I used a little more voltage to let the BMS balance cells. I applied 56V, 50mA however it probably didn't balance. I guess BMS has no cell balancing future, it's only protecting. On the other hand I recently bought a Ninebot F2 pro and it had maximum of 5mV cell voltage difference when arrived. I've ridden it for 60km now and it's still 5mV, it's cells dead on factory aligned, I really appreciated that quality.
[2023-09-24T12:22:51] cihan: Yes, that's what the stock controller claims but battery should probably supply some more as long as the integrated BMS allows.
[2023-09-24T12:23:14] cihan: Unfortunately, no name Chinese cells.
[2023-09-24T12:25:03] cihan: I'm not seeking too much power, 1500W for 10 seconds and 900W for a minute will be enough for me. I probably need a VESC controller with good heat dissipation and reliability.
[2023-09-24T12:27:53] cihan: Torque is important since I weigh 110kg. But speed is also important since I will be mostly riding on plain ground. What brought me to vesc controller is need for FOC controller. I couldn't find cheap and trusted Chinese FOC controller and then I discovered vesc.
[2023-09-24T12:30:59] cihan: I think I won't change the battery until it's dead and it will take pretty long time probably. And I will probably use same 13s5p setup when it's dead but this time with quality cells and a new BMS, probably LG or Sony VTC6. By the way people don't prefer VTC6 for scooter battery in general but they are reliable and their current handling capability is much better than LG, Samsung. LG cells heat up a lot by the way.
[2023-09-24T12:33:15] Konstantin: ;)))
[2023-09-24T12:47:24] francois schempers: you'll have plenty of torque if you can cool the Vesc well enough, you can have higher phase Amps than battery Amps, that just make more heat
[2023-09-24T12:47:46] puneDir: can someone teach me how to pull wheelies with e scooter
[2023-09-24T12:51:03] francois schempers: murata vtc6 I a great cell, molicel is a bit more expensive, but is hands down one the the best cells money can buy the p45 have 45A discharge and 4500mah
[2023-09-24T12:58:56] cihan: By the way I'm surprised how active this group is and how helpful everybody. Thanks everyone for the replies. VESC is the way to go for me as long as this group exists.

[2023-09-24T19:59:01] NetworkDir: https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/tools/voltage-divider-calculator/ Calculate your resistor with your voltage R2 resistor 10k ohm
[2023-09-24T19:59:02] NetworkDir: Resistor method easy
[2023-09-24T19:59:43] Mirono escooters: I'm guessing the rear one goes to EN and goes to batt +
[2023-09-24T20:01:00] puneDir: wasnt it gnd
[2023-09-24T20:01:12] puneDir: Oh no its not
[2023-09-24T20:07:18] Gabe Enzo: i think Tesla's use VFD cause they're actual AC
[2023-09-24T20:17:42] Mirono escooters: They are? ü§î

[2023-09-24T23:35:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: Xiaomi guys
[2023-09-24T23:36:44] puneDir: ls2
[2023-09-24T23:37:08] Mirono escooters: Finally came to the dark side?
[2023-09-24T23:37:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: No, I've seen this posted today x)
[2023-09-24T23:37:32] puneDir: making 70+ with xiaomis is another level
[2023-09-24T23:37:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: Not really
[2023-09-24T23:38:09] puneDir: yes it is
[2023-09-24T23:38:27] puneDir: its 100x more fun than making 100 with shitron
[2023-09-24T23:38:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: Not at all
[2023-09-24T23:39:21] Face de Pin Suc√©: And you speak to a guy pushing 75Kmh on his speedway leger with CST V3 8.5inch tyres
[2023-09-24T23:39:41] Mirono escooters: You win
[2023-09-24T23:40:00] Face de Pin Suc√©: But saying 70kmh on Xiaomi is another level is funny
[2023-09-24T23:40:23] Face de Pin Suc√©: There are guys here pushing 134kmh on G30, this is another level
[2023-09-24T23:41:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yeah but both is fun.
[2023-09-24T23:42:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes
[2023-09-24T23:42:28] Face de Pin Suc√©: I was only reacting to the part "is another level"
[2023-09-24T23:42:49] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: My PRO2 was fast and ready for every terrain, meanwhile G30 is brutally powerful and perfect for "race" but requires good road conditions.
[2023-09-24T23:45:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I need to rebuild my PRO2. I actually miss it.
[2023-09-24T23:45:48] Oreo huzky: Wearing helmet and shorts
[2023-09-24T23:47:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Haha
[2023-09-24T23:54:20] puneDir: i also have g30 that goes fast
[2023-09-24T23:56:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: yeah but not (that) fast
[2023-09-24T23:57:25] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But honestly after 100km/h it's not much more fun, it becomes a useless gimmick. I like acceleration more.
[2023-09-24T23:58:46] puneDir: yeah
[2023-09-24T23:58:50] puneDir: I guess 80-90 max
[2023-09-24T23:59:01] puneDir: but its a big deal to make 80-90 with g30 g1
[2023-09-24T23:59:17] puneDir: Shit motor compared to group general
[2023-09-24T23:59:22] cihan: I'm not sure how long tires are able to handle that much speed. 10 inch scooter tires probably don't have a speed rating.)
[2023-09-25T00:00:07] cihan: Video arriving)
[2023-09-25T00:00:13] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: friend of mine did 101 in shorts too üíÄ
[2023-09-25T00:01:04] cihan: It has a stem stabilizer, right?
[2023-09-25T00:01:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes but not for long.. It's useless, you can reach this speed for like 1-2 minutes before it will burn. I can drive 100km/h for about 50km total and stop every 30km for cooling motors.
[2023-09-25T00:01:30] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No
[2023-09-25T00:04:12] cihan: I'd be afraid of tank slapper.
[2023-09-25T00:05:04] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: tank slapper?
[2023-09-25T00:05:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It is very stable. I have not tried full power yet but others did 134 on the same setup already and since then quite a few improvements were made to stability.
[2023-09-25T00:07:46] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: My next goal for myself is 110 at daylight next time I wear protective gear. I don't want to go full vroom immediately without being used to this speed. I'm most of the time only doing 70-80 for 45km straight.
[2023-09-25T00:10:05] puneDir: yeah so its more like 65-70
[2023-09-25T00:10:29] cihan: https://youtu.be/IM3G9I5wcP4?si=M_xphTBtpMjQYTih That's it. You lose control of handlebar and oscillation amplitude gets bigger and bigger and at some point rider falls down.
[2023-09-25T00:12:01] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: You mean death wobble?
[2023-09-25T00:13:39] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Like I said there were made a few improvements to stability and it's very stable at high speed.
[2023-09-25T00:16:21] Finn: Damper would be a solution if you get death wobble
[2023-09-25T00:16:40] puneDir: I wonder how snsc suspension performs at high speed
[2023-09-25T00:16:41] cihan: I think forcing limits to the end can cause trouble at some point. Having an injury which could last life long isn't something anyone wants. And don't trust even high end protective gear, they never guarantee protection. A famous Turkish YouTuber - Barkƒ±n Bayoƒülu - died inside full protective gear and I guess gear on him could cost more than 5000 euros.
[2023-09-25T00:16:47] cihan: Yes
[2023-09-25T00:17:18] Finn: The question is what he was riding
[2023-09-25T00:17:25] Finn: And how fast
[2023-09-25T00:18:29] puneDir: It was weird crash but
[2023-09-25T00:18:35] cihan: Not sure, probably he was over 120 km/h when he hit a pedestrian who parked his car on the bridge (totally forbidden) and studeenly got out of the car and walked to the road.
[2023-09-25T00:18:44] puneDir: Tank slapper is scary asf
[2023-09-25T00:18:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes my gear is limited to gloves and helmet anyway...
[2023-09-25T00:18:57] cihan: It was a motorbike but I'm not sure about the model.
[2023-09-25T00:20:21] cihan: He died in vain. He wasn't guilty about the crash at all. But he would probably have time to maneuver if he was slower.
[2023-09-25T00:26:34] cihan: Anything unexpected, imponderable can happen. And you won't have time to stop or manuever with scooter. I think I could do such high speed with scooter only on a track which you rent for some time. I'm sorry for bothering you but I already lost 4 teeth with bicycle accident years ago. The fork broke and i was unconscious, they were loading me to an ambulance when I opened my eyes.
[2023-09-25T00:56:20] Oreo huzky: W rizz
[2023-09-25T01:40:30] Jan: Ugh ferrari üòÖ i know a guy who went from my last company to ferrari, now he gets fucked over every weekend
[2023-09-25T01:41:35] Jan: I dont know why people like ferrari
[2023-09-25T01:41:40] Jan: Its an absolute shitshow
[2023-09-25T04:19:47] francois schempers: you're not bothering anyone, safety is indeed a concern with what we are doing, we know
[2023-09-25T07:30:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: Hahaha
[2023-09-25T08:36:52] Gabe Enzo: It is.
[2023-09-25T08:37:05] Gabe Enzo: Going 70 on a Xiaomi feels different than going 70 on some prebuilt
[2023-09-25T08:37:39] Gabe Enzo: You should.
[2023-09-25T08:38:21] Face de Pin Suc√©: Come on, you guys always put 10inch wheels at least, start going these speeds with 8.5inch üòÇ
[2023-09-25T08:38:33] Gabe Enzo: Oh yes I went 70 with 8.5
[2023-09-25T08:38:35] Gabe Enzo: and no Suspension haha
[2023-09-25T08:38:47] Gabe Enzo: Its funny
[2023-09-25T08:38:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: I even reached 71Kmh on etwow solid 8" tyres, and I say it again, this is not "another level"
[2023-09-25T08:39:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: But yes it's funny
[2023-09-25T08:39:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: I'm okay saying it's a lot of fun
[2023-09-25T08:39:56] Gabe Enzo: My Kugoo G4 has the death wobble can't go faster than 70
[2023-09-25T08:40:51] Happy Giraffe: But even 60kmh downhill on xiaomi is scaryüòÇ its nice on flat but downhill hits different
[2023-09-25T08:41:19] Happy Giraffe: Meanwhile on bike 60kmh one handedüòÅ
[2023-09-25T08:41:24] Face de Pin Suc√©: I hate downhill haha
[2023-09-25T08:41:37] Face de Pin Suc√©: I like downhill only skiing üòÅ
[2023-09-25T08:41:46] Happy Giraffe: You feel like you lose all grip and weight on scooter downhill
[2023-09-25T08:41:57] Gabe Enzo: my dad went 60 downhill and accidentally pressed front brake because it was a foreign bike
[2023-09-25T08:43:56] Happy Giraffe: Front brake dangerous for untrained people
[2023-09-25T08:44:17] Happy Giraffe: But people fear it too much imo, should just go to parking lot and learn to control it
[2023-09-25T10:56:04] Face de Pin Suc√©: <video_file>
[2023-09-25T10:56:57] Face de Pin Suc√©: Guys, I have a 60H motor 125mm fork opening, fitting G30, if you need it 4mm¬≤ phase wires, hall sensors, temp sensor NTC 10K 6inch rim 250‚Ç¨ without shipping

[2023-09-25T12:01:53] Mirono escooters: Too expensive for me
[2023-09-25T12:01:58] Mirono escooters: And looks like toy
[2023-09-25T12:21:59] Gabe Enzo: lools like something from Smyth's Toys
[2023-09-25T12:23:54] Mirono escooters: Bweh
[2023-09-25T12:25:26] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-09-25T12:25:28] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-09-25T12:25:32] Mirono escooters: Looks waay better
[2023-09-25T12:25:55] Mirono escooters: It's not that bad
[2023-09-25T12:26:00] Mirono escooters: For commuting
[2023-09-25T12:26:16] Gabe Enzo: They should've made an ES with a Xiaomi dashboard
[2023-09-25T12:26:23] Gabe Enzo: And batts on the bottom
[2023-09-25T12:26:24] Gabe Enzo: oh wait
[2023-09-25T12:26:30] Gabe Enzo: that's just an m365 then
[2023-09-25T12:26:31] Gabe Enzo: lol
[2023-09-25T12:26:57] Gabe Enzo: I commute to college on my kugoo üòÇ 22km one way
[2023-09-25T12:27:10] Gabe Enzo: Na i mean the ES
[2023-09-25T12:27:20] Gabe Enzo: neither have suspension
[2023-09-25T12:27:30] Gabe Enzo: wut
[2023-09-25T12:27:31] Gabe Enzo: wtf
[2023-09-25T12:27:36] Mirono escooters: Folding can use some work
[2023-09-25T12:27:54] Mirono escooters: Oh Jezus. I could never stand up that long everyday
[2023-09-25T12:28:21] Mirono escooters: Shitty front
[2023-09-25T12:28:39] Mirono escooters: And air tire
[2023-09-25T12:28:45] Mirono escooters: Ya
[2023-09-25T12:29:15] Gabe Enzo: Need a seat for it. Funnily enough the Kugoo G4 advertised as 75km range only has about 40 when going medium mode.
[2023-09-25T12:29:27] Mirono escooters: Moh
[2023-09-25T12:51:38] Konstantin: My can reach 60 kmh, only 15s voltage;) and 1 motor.
[2023-09-25T12:54:33] Konstantin: He is very old... but still funny xD
[2023-09-25T13:51:21] Applez Ontop: Anyone know if possible to change es2 tires to pneumatic?
[2023-09-25T13:54:57] francois schempers: s√ªre, you may have to buy a new rim though
[2023-09-25T14:19:33] francois schempers: everything is possible with some tools üòÇ
[2023-09-25T14:20:15] francois schempers: 10" 3" while tire on m365 ? of course üòÇ
[2023-09-25T14:20:41] francois schempers: <sticker>
[2023-09-25T14:22:50] francois schempers: oh yeah, just waiting for some cash on hand, g2 alone setted me back a bit üòÇ
[2023-09-25T14:25:02] Happy Giraffe: Didn't you have the car?
[2023-09-25T14:25:10] francois schempers: yeah it's my daily ride for now
[2023-09-25T14:25:13] Happy Giraffe: You abandoned us, I remember that forever
[2023-09-25T14:25:55] francois schempers: nah ! always will be in my heart üòÇüòÇüòò
[2023-09-25T14:26:28] francois schempers: I'll catch up later, I'll tell you all about it üëå
[2023-09-25T17:24:52] Oreo huzky: Bro my rear brake caliper just unscrewed itself while driving and it spilled washers everywhere
[2023-09-25T17:25:47] Oreo huzky: Imagine that happen while race
[2023-09-25T17:27:04] JPPL: Fuckkk
[2023-09-25T17:27:40] JPPL: 2 days ago my daily loose the pin and after some breaking one pad went missing and caliper blocked disk
[2023-09-25T17:28:10] JPPL: Keep safe üí™
[2023-09-25T17:28:37] Oreo huzky: Was funny though
[2023-09-25T18:50:29] cihan: Do you use high voltage battery with stock 36V motor to draw more current without voltage drop and also not to let the BMS shut down current? Why more series cells rather than more parallel? Also because easier to charge faster? Ubox 100V 100A is a recommended controller but makerbase 60100HP also seems reasonable to me with thicker wires and phase line sampling. Will ubox be more reliable and have better components? I think 60V will be enough for me for a very long time.
[2023-09-25T18:53:27] JPPL: More serie cells equals more voltage, more speed More parallel give same specs but for longer range
[2023-09-25T18:54:05] JPPL: 60v is a good daily so both controllers are good choice in my opinion
[2023-09-25T18:57:29] cihan: I won't need more than 1500W for current scooter. I don't think any of these controllers use ICs from brands with high reputation, they should be all Chinese ICs so I don't know if paying more makes sense for me.
[2023-09-25T18:58:28] cihan: I'm not expecting to see Texas Instruments ICs in any of them. :)
[2023-09-25T18:59:48] cihan: I only don't like those capacitors sticking out of aluminum case with 60100HP. I don't know why they did it.
[2023-09-25T19:09:52] Mirono escooters: Because not enough space
[2023-09-25T19:10:01] Mirono escooters: They are on the bare minimum of caps anywat
[2023-09-25T19:39:09] cihan: Does anyone make strange shaped batteries to use the available space completely? :)
[2023-09-25T19:42:19] Mirono escooters: We all do, i think
[2023-09-25T19:42:22] Mirono escooters: Use max space
[2023-09-25T19:54:22] Eric Howat: Guesses on what it looks like inside? LoL
[2023-09-25T19:55:15] puneDir: can i have it
[2023-09-25T20:03:23] Oreo huzky: Bro that motor is crusty as hell
[2023-09-25T20:03:52] Eric Howat: Lmaooo it was a marketplace find super crusty no keys or charger but everything works ü§òüèª
[2023-09-25T20:04:23] Eric Howat: <photos/photo_9898@25-09-2023_20-04-23.jpg>
[2023-09-25T20:04:24] Oreo huzky: I would be scared of the motor shaft breaking it looks to be really rusty
[2023-09-25T20:04:32] Eric Howat: Seen better days but it was only $125
[2023-09-25T20:04:41] Oreo huzky: That‚Äôs nice
[2023-09-25T20:04:41] Eric Howat: That‚Äôs just surface rust
[2023-09-25T20:04:56] Mirono escooters: Works? XD
[2023-09-25T20:05:07] Oreo huzky: Battery at like 10V
[2023-09-25T20:05:09] Mirono escooters: Nice deal
[2023-09-25T20:05:10] Eric Howat: Kid you not!
[2023-09-25T20:05:14] Mirono escooters: And yeah surface rust
[2023-09-25T20:05:16] Mirono escooters: Enjoy the ride
[2023-09-25T20:05:18] Eric Howat: Battery was at 55v actually lol
[2023-09-25T20:05:26] Oreo huzky: Oh okay
[2023-09-25T20:05:37] Oreo huzky: But no keys sounds like stolen
[2023-09-25T20:05:42] Eric Howat: So whoever stored it knew something about that atleast. I figured it was a total loss and use it for parts but it was straight
[2023-09-25T20:06:06] Eric Howat: I figured that too, but there‚Äôs no way the guy I bought it from was some middle aged dude who just didn‚Äôt take care of things you could tell
[2023-09-25T20:06:28] Oreo huzky: Motor bearings also crusty?
[2023-09-25T20:06:41] Eric Howat: Not sure yet about to find out lol
[2023-09-25T20:09:53] Oreo huzky: @SibClimb any updates?
[2023-09-25T20:10:18] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Why you always ask him in public instead of writing him via PM.
[2023-09-25T20:10:40] Oreo huzky: He never replies when I do it with pm
[2023-09-25T20:57:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: Too many messages, I see more when it's in a group sadly
[2023-09-25T20:58:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: But told you updates tuesday, which is tomorrow

[2023-09-25T22:37:26] Eric Howat: Does anyone know how to wire brake lights to activate off ADC 2 regen throttle? Should I run positive to ADC 2 for power to brake lights?
[2023-09-25T22:42:44] NetworkDir: Might with arduino or esp32 ?
[2023-09-25T22:43:36] Mirono escooters: Id just use a simple pullup mos design
[2023-09-25T22:43:55] Mirono escooters: But that can be tricky. Programming esp32 makes more sense. Also brake light intensity, curve, blanla

[2023-09-25T22:49:28] Eric Howat: Planning to use this, how do you setup in VESCtool or do you not even have too?
[2023-09-26T01:49:02] cihan: Do you have a recommendation for active balancing BMS? I need 13s but something 20s supporting 13s could be better.
[2023-09-26T01:49:31] cihan: If it can show voltages with Bluetooth cinnection, much much better.
[2023-09-26T01:52:45] cihan: What about this one? So many sold and good review and has phone app too. Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out!

[2023-09-26T04:51:45] haku: Hello everyone. I am new to vesc. I just finished wiring my scooter and took it for a ride. It is smooth but when i am stopped it makes this humming noise. Any ideas how to fix this? Thank you
[2023-09-26T04:55:41] Applez Ontop: for the internal extra battery on the m365/mi3, does the balance wires come with the BMS?

[2023-09-26T08:23:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: Throttle calibration seems not right
[2023-09-26T08:43:56] haku: Thank you. I have the spinny spintend throttle. Can i calibrate it in vesc tool?
[2023-09-26T08:45:55] Happy Giraffe: You have to calibrate that as a standalone unit before use
[2023-09-26T08:46:11] Happy Giraffe: There is manual and instructional video of it by Spintend
[2023-09-26T08:46:31] Happy Giraffe: Haven't done it personally so cant help more
[2023-09-26T08:46:44] haku: Spintend already did it for me. They are so nice. I will ask them also.
[2023-09-26T08:47:00] Happy Giraffe: Just see the video
[2023-09-26T08:47:18] Happy Giraffe: Or when you set up ADC inputs you see how it behaves
[2023-09-26T08:47:29] haku: Thank you so much i will recheck the calibration
[2023-09-26T08:47:51] Happy Giraffe: First do ADC mapping if you havent done already
[2023-09-26T08:47:59] Happy Giraffe: Might solve issue straight away
[2023-09-26T08:49:04] haku: Im new to vesc tool. Can i do that on the phone app. My desktop is buggy with vesctool 6.02
[2023-09-26T08:49:22] Happy Giraffe: Yes, when doing adc calibration always lift motor wheel off ground
[2023-09-26T08:49:54] haku: Will do thank you! Appretiate your time
[2023-09-26T08:49:54] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_9902@26-09-2023_08-49-54.jpg>

[2023-09-26T08:50:10] Happy Giraffe: There you find it
[2023-09-26T08:50:33] haku: Got it. I will try right now
[2023-09-26T08:50:56] Happy Giraffe: Also you gotta select centered throttle before doing calibration, during calibration push throttle both ways and apply and "write"
[2023-09-26T08:51:58] Happy Giraffe: This for Spiny throttle
[2023-09-26T08:52:24] Happy Giraffe: At middle its neutral, braking below center value and acceleration above center value
[2023-09-26T08:57:31] haku: Yes those are my settings aswell
[2023-09-26T09:05:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: Same
[2023-09-26T10:46:13] Jan: For spiny2 there is a hardware throttle calibration that has to be done before using vesc! (Check if your throttle light is green) And then do vesc throttle calibration @Bradhaku
[2023-09-26T10:46:41] Jan: <photos/photo_9905@26-09-2023_10-46-41.jpg>
[2023-09-26T10:46:51] Jan: Orange light = shit
[2023-09-26T11:07:56] Gabe Enzo: Good idea for my Kugoo G4? I've recently bought one but the stock ESC it comes with is iinefficient. It limits speeds but not amps. Its terrible.
[2023-09-26T11:08:15] Gabe Enzo: Can I still keep my old dashboard when I install one of these? how exactly does this work?
[2023-09-26T11:08:47] Gabe Enzo: I know flipsky has bad rep but I'll be putting barely 3000w into this.
[2023-09-26T11:08:48] Finn: Ubox best
[2023-09-26T11:08:56] Gabe Enzo: Too expensive
[2023-09-26T11:09:04] Gabe Enzo: already spent 1000 on this scooter
[2023-09-26T11:09:09] Finn: too good
[2023-09-26T11:09:20] Finn: get mks 75100
[2023-09-26T11:10:04] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_9907@26-09-2023_11-10-04.jpg>
[2023-09-26T11:10:10] Gabe Enzo: is this real? it looks terribly cheap
[2023-09-26T11:15:09] Finn: Ye
[2023-09-26T11:15:15] Finn: Get from official makerbase
[2023-09-26T11:20:10] Gabe Enzo: I can't find the real site
[2023-09-26T11:20:18] Gabe Enzo: So is that real on AliExpress?
[2023-09-26T11:21:14] Finn: Makerbase Official Store https://a.aliexpress.com/_mqw600a
[2023-09-26T11:22:39] Gabe Enzo: wtf, 2 week shipping
[2023-09-26T11:28:19] sombre_enfant: Yeah get that it has bt module already and enhanced cooling
[2023-09-26T11:33:51] Gabe Enzo: bt module already? are you saying some of them DONT?
[2023-09-26T11:33:59] Gabe Enzo: wtf
[2023-09-26T12:08:02] Mirono escooters: Tis even cHeaper
[2023-09-26T12:08:12] Gabe Enzo: its good tho yeah?
[2023-09-26T12:08:22] Gabe Enzo: like I will have no issues?
[2023-09-26T12:08:28] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-09-26T12:09:24] Mirono escooters: You need to add it externally
[2023-09-26T12:09:30] Mirono escooters: Most are like dis Nothing special..
[2023-09-26T12:11:39] cihan: What does phase line sampling actually do? 60100HP has it but 75100 and 75200 doesn't.
[2023-09-26T12:12:18] Finn: they do
[2023-09-26T12:12:31] Finn: but only half of the phase
[2023-09-26T13:06:33] Happy Giraffe: 20$ more
[2023-09-26T13:40:54] Gabe Enzo: its only flipsky that has the BMS death issue no?
[2023-09-26T13:41:07] Finn: Makerbase too
[2023-09-26T13:41:08] Gabe Enzo: what feature to turn off vesc?
[2023-09-26T13:41:43] Gabe Enzo: What if I use 1zunas Xiaomi dash script? that has a button
[2023-09-26T13:42:06] Gabe Enzo: You mean I have to open up the scooter every time I come back?
[2023-09-26T13:42:08] Gabe Enzo: makes no sense
[2023-09-26T13:42:14] Gabe Enzo: there has to be a way around this
[2023-09-26T13:42:37] Gabe Enzo: That wastes energy no? or is that a myth
[2023-09-26T13:43:25] Gabe Enzo: could just make an internal shunt that opens and closes the battery circuit. With proper mechanics it should be fine.
[2023-09-26T13:43:32] Gabe Enzo: Oh wait
[2023-09-26T13:43:34] Gabe Enzo: anti spark
[2023-09-26T13:43:35] Gabe Enzo: goddamnit
[2023-09-26T13:43:43] Gabe Enzo: ugh
[2023-09-26T13:44:01] Gabe Enzo: So there's no way to like use a key ignition?
[2023-09-26T13:44:21] Gabe Enzo: I saw @kawaiinekololis use one I stg
[2023-09-26T13:45:08] NetworkDir: Mks shit
[2023-09-26T13:45:13] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_9908@26-09-2023_13-45-13.jpg>
[2023-09-26T13:45:15] Gabe Enzo: Everything is shit
[2023-09-26T13:45:27] Gabe Enzo: Tbh
[2023-09-26T13:45:34] NetworkDir: @jamessoderstrom lmfao
[2023-09-26T13:45:42] Finn: Lmao
[2023-09-26T13:45:49] NetworkDir: See answer
[2023-09-26T13:46:04] Gabe Enzo: LOL
[2023-09-26T13:46:05] Finn: ü•∏
[2023-09-26T13:46:31] Gabe Enzo: there's no way to make it clean then lol
[2023-09-26T13:46:32] Gabe Enzo: wtf
[2023-09-26T13:47:08] Gabe Enzo: Brierus Vesc release better have an off switch I swear
[2023-09-26T13:47:23] Gabe Enzo: How would that work
[2023-09-26T13:47:47] Gabe Enzo: Wdym do you mean flipsky has an off switch?
[2023-09-26T13:48:05] Gabe Enzo: So how do you all solve this problem?
[2023-09-26T13:48:08] Finn: Makerbase engineersü§°
[2023-09-26T13:48:08] haku: I see. Mine is green but when you push the throttle a red light would come out. Then back to green when its in neutral.
[2023-09-26T13:48:12] Finn: <photos/photo_9910@26-09-2023_13-48-12.jpg>
[2023-09-26T13:48:35] Gabe Enzo: what do you use then?
[2023-09-26T13:49:10] Finn: Uboxüî•
[2023-09-26T13:50:10] Gabe Enzo: 16s only üíÄ
[2023-09-26T13:50:34] Gabe Enzo: spintend 75100 is
[2023-09-26T13:53:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: We don't buy hehe
[2023-09-26T13:54:21] Gabe Enzo: i don't push 10kw+ like you freaks üòÇ
[2023-09-26T13:54:30] Gabe Enzo: 7kw max.
[2023-09-26T13:54:36] Gabe Enzo: Lmao
[2023-09-26T13:55:26] Gabe Enzo: Right. I use 20s anyways
[2023-09-26T13:55:57] Gabe Enzo: Xiaomi ESC has no issues with 3.5kw. Dual motor double escs that's 7kw
[2023-09-26T13:56:34] Gabe Enzo: its still impressive to me how a shit PCB can handle 3.5kw tbh
[2023-09-26T13:56:42] Gabe Enzo: idk how the energy even flows through it
[2023-09-26T13:56:52] Gabe Enzo: Reinforcing really is good
[2023-09-26T13:56:55] NetworkDir: Little bit expensive but very good
[2023-09-26T13:57:09] NetworkDir: Quality = experience
[2023-09-26T14:02:55] cihan: Is the only problem about Makerbase and Flipsky shut down and mosfet burning? Or do you also find other shortcomings of Makerbase and Flipsky against Ubox or any other areas where Ubox is superior? I guess I've started leaning towards Ubox already.
[2023-09-26T14:14:09] cihan: Do real values all the time fluctuate between 50-150% of assigned values or real values are for example always 80% or 130% of the assigned value according to the sample unit you have?
[2023-09-26T14:17:20] cihan: Yes, they have potential to tell you not to buy their products.)
[2023-09-26T14:18:43] cihan: It's something like buying cheap, no name power supply. It writes 700W on it but it's actually 500W.)
[2023-09-26T14:19:50] cihan: I'm not sure if reason is only shunt resistor. All cheap multimeters measure current at most with 1-2% error but they burn, explode, etc.
[2023-09-26T14:23:19] puneDir: what about flipsky 75100?
[2023-09-26T14:23:28] puneDir: isnt it more accurate
[2023-09-26T14:25:53] cihan: Possible. I didn't really understand how it burns when you disconnect from battery. You also disconnect it from battery with spark plug. Isn't that just a switch?
[2023-09-26T14:29:01] puneDir: what if the power is still connected to power and disconnects from 12v regulator
[2023-09-26T14:29:11] puneDir: like our diy on off switch
[2023-09-26T14:29:56] puneDir: lets try and kill 2 escs while!
[2023-09-26T14:30:35] cihan: I've read heat dissipation issues about Ubox 100V 100A from @kawaiinekololis on official spintend page. I'm getting more confused about choosing a model.
[2023-09-26T14:31:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes the 100v 100A sucks, but 80v 100A alu seems decent
[2023-09-26T14:31:16] puneDir: 80v one supports 20s?
[2023-09-26T14:31:40] cihan: Well, I think I can understand people here. It's hard to control yourself and not increase current a little bit more while the motor can handle it. So BMS can also cut down current for me too.)
[2023-09-26T14:31:54] puneDir: we need high discharge bms
[2023-09-26T14:31:58] puneDir: i have 2x 40a
[2023-09-26T14:32:11] puneDir: cuz we cant find any good 20s bms in turkey
[2023-09-26T14:32:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Lmao
[2023-09-26T14:32:33] Mirono escooters: It adds spice
[2023-09-26T14:33:37] puneDir: yeah ik not much
[2023-09-26T14:33:40] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-09-26T14:34:29] cihan: Aliexpress has many claiming 120A and reviews are good too. Don't they supply the current they're supposed to?
[2023-09-26T14:34:39] puneDir: i have 2x 20s4p
[2023-09-26T14:34:43] puneDir: theyre 10a cells
[2023-09-26T14:34:49] puneDir: so 2x 40 is ok
[2023-09-26T14:35:03] puneDir: i want 21700 molicell setup
[2023-09-26T14:35:14] puneDir: Whole frame battery
[2023-09-26T14:35:18] Oreo huzky: @SibClimb anything new?
[2023-09-26T14:35:20] puneDir: Escs on outside
[2023-09-26T14:36:29] Mirono escooters: Anything> daly
[2023-09-26T14:36:48] Gabe Enzo: molicel is useless if you don't pull more than 60a. You can make 20s8p of 6.4a 21700s if you have a "low power" setup
[2023-09-26T14:37:07] Gabe Enzo: That's what I'm making next month.
[2023-09-26T14:37:18] Gabe Enzo: 20s10p of 6.4a cells, 64A constant.
[2023-09-26T14:37:26] Gabe Enzo: 1.35‚Ç¨ a pop.
[2023-09-26T14:37:39] Gabe Enzo: so cheap
[2023-09-26T14:37:41] puneDir: imma get 2x 60h in january
[2023-09-26T14:37:46] Finn: Or get 30T
[2023-09-26T14:37:53] puneDir: so i need current
[2023-09-26T14:38:31] Gabe Enzo: Why not make 20s20p. the low power cells will still compensate cause they're cheaper
[2023-09-26T14:38:50] Gabe Enzo: Only thing molicel is better at is output to size ratio. even so it's still more expensive
[2023-09-26T14:39:09] Gabe Enzo: what wattage?
[2023-09-26T14:39:15] puneDir: i will need a suitcase for that
[2023-09-26T14:39:25] Gabe Enzo: True. But imagine the runtimes.
[2023-09-26T14:39:29] Gabe Enzo: 5kw
[2023-09-26T14:39:32] Gabe Enzo: 6kw
[2023-09-26T14:39:35] puneDir: i wanna be izuna
[2023-09-26T14:40:16] Gabe Enzo: NOT iZuna but 1zuna üòÇ
[2023-09-26T14:41:11] puneDir: some piece of shits call 1zunes
[2023-09-26T14:41:11] Gabe Enzo: Also, 400 batteries isn't alot.
[2023-09-26T14:41:19] puneDir: Thats a fucking g30
[2023-09-26T14:41:24] Gabe Enzo: Exactly
[2023-09-26T14:41:34] Gabe Enzo: i mean size wise
[2023-09-26T14:42:27] Gabe Enzo: You could simply weld your own base.
[2023-09-26T14:42:48] Gabe Enzo: Kugoo G4 could easy hold 400 cells.
[2023-09-26T14:43:13] Gabe Enzo: Even if not, why not use an external bag?
[2023-09-26T14:43:18] Gabe Enzo: half there and half there.
[2023-09-26T14:43:40] Gabe Enzo: or 2 bags.

[2023-09-26T15:30:11] Happy Giraffe: If you need 10A per cell or less then LG M50LT is good. For 10A-20A Molicel P42A 20-35A Molicel P45B
[2023-09-26T15:30:35] Happy Giraffe: Wouldn't waste space for 30T as the capacity is so low
[2023-09-26T15:30:48] Oreo huzky: Huh I pull 45A from p42A
[2023-09-26T15:31:07] Happy Giraffe: P45B much better for that
[2023-09-26T15:32:00] Happy Giraffe: Ofc you can sometimes stress cell a bit more but wouldnt do it on a daily basis. Reduced life and heats up
[2023-09-26T15:32:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Me too. I have done 135A on a 20S3P with P42A. Not warm enough to be worried.
[2023-09-26T15:32:53] Happy Giraffe: These were meant as continuous numbers
[2023-09-26T15:33:11] Oreo huzky: It‚Äôs only in burst it will go down as I get faster and then get up again when I get even faster
[2023-09-26T15:33:42] Happy Giraffe: Yeah for short period
[2023-09-26T15:34:04] Happy Giraffe: Moooch has tested all the cellsüòÅ

[2023-09-26T15:34:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Seems alright
[2023-09-26T15:35:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: As long they are temp sensored ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
[2023-09-26T15:35:47] Oreo huzky: Ye I‚Äôve seen others also saying that p42a is rated at 20A wich was a bit strange
[2023-09-26T15:36:17] Oreo huzky: https://www.akkuteile.de/lithium-ionen-akkus/21700/inr21700-p42a-4200mah-30a-bis-max-45a-li-ionen-akku-3-6v-3-7v_100813_2558
[2023-09-26T15:36:24] Oreo huzky: They say 30A
[2023-09-26T15:36:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I would keep an eye on it if you actually put this load continuous but in this case, probably alright. I doubt that @Oreohuzky pulls 350A for a significant amount of time.
[2023-09-26T15:37:04] Oreo huzky: No one actually knows how much they can do üòÇ
[2023-09-26T15:37:08] Nik: wtf is that price üòê
[2023-09-26T15:37:14] Oreo huzky: Ye
[2023-09-26T15:37:24] Nik: gah damn i went broke just by looking lmfao
[2023-09-26T15:37:45] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Because there is no strict limitation. People here also pulled a lil beyond the rating of 45A too.
[2023-09-26T15:37:47] Oreo huzky: Yes as I said it‚Äôs only on burst and really fast rides that it will reach that current
[2023-09-26T15:48:46] Gabe Enzo: Its 45a constant right. So 45a will have zero overheating issues because it's made for it.
[2023-09-26T15:49:36] Gabe Enzo: the rating is kinda a curve safety thing.
[2023-09-26T15:49:46] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 35A is said to not overheat at all, 45A should be temp controlled
[2023-09-26T15:59:32] Happy Giraffe: <files/9E29EE62-70E6-4525-A780-47320CB2D6A9.jpeg>
[2023-09-26T15:59:49] Happy Giraffe: Higher resolution image there
[2023-09-26T16:00:39] Happy Giraffe: Then there's also individual in depth tests results on each cell
[2023-09-26T16:08:25] cihan: It seems expensive to me too. Cell prices ramped up a lot lately in USD.
[2023-09-26T16:11:03] cihan: Using vtc6 is much cheaper compared to molicel p42A. Space could be wasted though.
[2023-09-26T16:13:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes because shit shop, mostly for low amount sale. People that vape and only need 1-2 pcs.
[2023-09-26T16:14:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 4,05‚Ç¨ if you buy 200pcs on NKON
[2023-09-26T16:14:14] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: which is pretty good compared to what I paid before... xd :(
[2023-09-26T16:14:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: in 2021
[2023-09-26T16:14:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: in 2022
[2023-09-26T16:15:08] cihan: It's a lot cheaper than vtc6 now.
[2023-09-26T16:15:09] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: in 2023 - and now they are even cheaper...
[2023-09-26T16:15:40] cihan: Are Molicel cells made in Japan?
[2023-09-26T16:15:52] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Taiwan
[2023-09-26T16:15:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: probably
[2023-09-26T16:15:57] cihan: Still good
[2023-09-26T16:15:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: at least their HQ is Taiwan
[2023-09-26T16:16:15] cihan: Something made in Taiwan is mostly good
[2023-09-26T16:17:16] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I do not care where its from, as long they perform well and I am only using them (somtimes did use 40T but now P42A cheaper than 40T), so yes they do :)
[2023-09-26T16:18:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: ah about 40T, they even work with screws inside
[2023-09-26T16:18:23] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: <photos/photo_9917@26-09-2023_16-18-23.jpg>
[2023-09-26T16:46:34] Happy Giraffe: Like 99% of cpus and gpusüòÅ
[2023-09-26T16:54:11] cihan: Not only them, something made for durability is also good like bicycle frames, most big and well known bicycle companies buy frames from a few Taiwanese companies. As far as I know Trek, Giant and Canyon also use Taiwanese frame now.
[2023-09-26T16:56:11] Happy Giraffe: Too bad there's no bicycle frames for high power diy ebike. I would love to see 5kg heavier beefed up DH frame with 50% thicker tubes etc
[2023-09-26T16:56:37] Mirono escooters: No market value
[2023-09-26T16:56:56] Mirono escooters: Or you stay passive mtb frame basic good power Or you go madlad Falcon/stealth/ surron
[2023-09-26T16:57:02] Mirono escooters: Almost no one in between
[2023-09-26T16:57:03] Happy Giraffe: Sadly all people nowadays buy the 250w 6000‚Ç¨ 90Nm mid drive
[2023-09-26T16:57:18] Mirono escooters: Or you get a speedpedelec frame and legalise 45kmh Still, not that good Frames.
[2023-09-26T16:57:36] Happy Giraffe: Surron is overpriced imo, can get used 300cc dirtbike for same moneyüòÅ
[2023-09-26T16:57:49] cihan: I don't know if it's really worth it. They make it a little beefier and it becomes electric motorbike, it's more durable. Carrying 40-50 kg bicycle is maybe worth for storage in winter and taking it out in summer.
[2023-09-26T16:57:49] Mirono escooters: ü§∑i aint no fan eithr.
[2023-09-26T16:58:45] Happy Giraffe: Building your own frames would be such a huge skill to have
[2023-09-26T16:59:39] Happy Giraffe: Almost fits, a prototype torque arm made this morning until I get the CN machined oneüòÇ
[2023-09-26T17:00:17] Mirono escooters: Yah, so much time
[2023-09-26T17:00:20] Happy Giraffe: Welds look blobby as I needed the extra material for strenght
[2023-09-26T17:01:51] Happy Giraffe: Hardest was to make the axle cut precise with only hand tools
[2023-09-26T20:53:31] puneDir: <video_file>
[2023-09-26T20:53:36] puneDir: he did something again
[2023-09-26T20:54:58] Mirono escooters: Shall I already prepare the scooter gore group
[2023-09-26T20:55:11] puneDir: why
[2023-09-26T20:55:17] puneDir: its good
[2023-09-26T20:55:27] puneDir: but that 240 cluster is bad and weird
[2023-09-26T20:58:29] Mirono escooters: Why max so high
[2023-09-26T20:58:33] Mirono escooters: He going 240?
[2023-09-26T20:58:45] puneDir: idk probably some stock pic
[2023-09-26T20:59:03] puneDir: 240 with m365 üëç
[2023-09-26T21:00:33] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: XD
[2023-09-26T21:01:01] NetworkDir: Speedometer transparent image little bit hard to find

[2023-09-26T21:06:10] Mirono escooters: Uwu
[2023-09-26T21:50:39] haku: Hey guys. Im having trouble opening my vesc tool 6.2 in windows 10. The app runs but it just stays in the task bar and its not opening. I tried reinstalling it and still nothing. Anyone know the fix to this?
[2023-09-26T22:07:11] Jason Nelson: I believe vesc is portable
[2023-09-26T22:07:32] Jason Nelson: As in you shouldn't need to install anything
[2023-09-26T23:38:30] Oreo huzky: Hey is 1600A enough for 0.1 nickel copper sandwich?
[2023-09-26T23:39:11] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-09-26T23:40:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: Even 1000A enough, depends by pulse time
[2023-09-26T23:41:38] Mirono escooters: Ya but you don't wanna melt half the nickel away :)
[2023-09-26T23:41:42] Mirono escooters: Above 1500 defo need
[2023-09-26T23:45:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Best way is flux welding
[2023-09-26T23:46:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: Safest option
[2023-09-26T23:46:14] Mirono escooters: :(
[2023-09-26T23:54:19] Konstantin: Pure nickel nice too. Sandwich - to much iteration.
[2023-09-26T23:57:31] Oreo huzky: I want to build stealth daily with 180A so I need copper
[2023-09-26T23:57:44] Konstantin: <photos/photo_9920@26-09-2023_23-57-44.jpg>
[2023-09-26T23:58:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Tig still best
[2023-09-26T23:58:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: But machine too big , sad
[2023-09-26T23:59:15] Konstantin: But now need reconfigure from 4s19p to 8s9p(10)... holy moly
[2023-09-27T00:08:49] Konstantin: Need resume testing;)
[2023-09-27T00:08:49] Konstantin: <photos/photo_9921@27-09-2023_00-08-49.jpg>
[2023-09-27T00:09:46] Konstantin: 25 kg weight;))) uhhh
[2023-09-27T00:25:53] Gabe Enzo: what motor and frame are you using?
[2023-09-27T00:34:38] Oreo huzky: Same as @kawaiinekololis
[2023-09-27T00:35:14] Mirono escooters: Wa da?
[2023-09-27T00:36:03] Oreo huzky: It‚Äôs a dohickey
[2023-09-27T01:11:59] Santiago: Jan's steel arm plates after primerüòÅüòÅü•πü•π
[2023-09-27T01:22:06] francois schempers: so, the g2 is good value, well made, plenty of space to customise, motor is the silentest motor I ever used, back suspension is good enough, I will probably switch front suspension for something else, I saw on Russian forum that some bent the suspension arm on accident. you are a bit higher thanks to suspension an the pole is thick, sturdy and longer, bigger handle too, with blinkers and horn, if you ever want one nevers update to 1.4.8 if you want to go 32km/h
[2023-09-27T01:37:07] francois schempers: this, or the monorim front suspension
[2023-09-27T01:49:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: white? Is your scooter white?
[2023-09-27T01:52:36] Santiago: Lol no, the primer is white
[2023-09-27T01:52:54] Santiago: I will paint it black matte when dried up
[2023-09-27T01:53:15] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: ah ok
[2023-09-27T01:53:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: i got mine in the g30 sparkly color
[2023-09-27T01:54:18] Santiago: I'm a black or white typa person xD
[2023-09-27T01:54:44] Santiago: No in between hahah
[2023-09-27T01:57:18] francois schempers: what about Chinese or Indian people ? you don't like them ? üòÇüòÇ
[2023-09-27T02:00:01] Santiago: I expected somebody to ask something like this ü§£ü§£
[2023-09-27T02:37:10] francois schempers: <sticker>
[2023-09-27T06:22:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes I have. It's another issue that just spontaneously happens with vesc 6.05. I don't know why it's like that, but I'm trying out few things already.
[2023-09-27T06:23:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It only happens after rebooting the ESC multiple times
[2023-09-27T06:26:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I will check later I have to hurry or else I'm late for school.
[2023-09-27T06:36:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Beta 15 me too
[2023-09-27T06:52:41] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Are you running the version where the button logic is at the bottom or inside a function?
[2023-09-27T06:52:52] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Because so far I have not encountered this issue anymore.
[2023-09-27T06:53:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: :/
[2023-09-27T06:54:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Ah good
[2023-09-27T06:55:00] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: So it might be fixed already
[2023-09-27T06:56:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I will try after lesson by forcefully restarting my vesc multiple times. I also have not tried the newest commit for fhe can cmd thing yet
[2023-09-27T06:57:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: xd me after school
[2023-09-27T06:58:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: That was my initial thought as well
[2023-09-27T06:58:15] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But when reading it from memory and uploading it again
[2023-09-27T06:58:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It works
[2023-09-27T06:58:25] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But not when restarting.
[2023-09-27T07:02:12] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Works fine for me. Nothing that wasn't broken anyways before üòÖ
[2023-09-27T07:03:45] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes... Happens to me as well. E-brake sometimes just accelerates backwards for me when standing still üòê
[2023-09-27T07:04:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: That's why I proposed the idea of a minimum brake speed, duty whatever. It would just need a small is abs duty<0.1 or smth to fix it.
[2023-09-27T07:05:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Ah ok üòÇ
[2023-09-27T07:05:46] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Then what's this about?
[2023-09-27T07:06:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Hmm not experienced yet.
[2023-09-27T07:07:36] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Well I don't have rear brakes
[2023-09-27T07:10:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Logic remains the same, but so far it did not happen to me anymore.
[2023-09-27T07:10:41] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But maybe i just didn't restart often enough
[2023-09-27T07:11:42] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Since I flashed 6.05 i already have done 900km üíÄ
[2023-09-27T07:12:23] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Too bad I did not keep track before...
[2023-09-27T07:12:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes
[2023-09-27T07:13:38] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No idea
[2023-09-27T09:35:47] Oreo huzky: @SibClimb Look in pms
[2023-09-27T09:54:54] Gabe Enzo: What course are you doing?
[2023-09-27T09:55:16] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: School?
[2023-09-27T09:55:26] Gabe Enzo: You're under 18?
[2023-09-27T09:55:39] Gabe Enzo: I thought you were studying engineering
[2023-09-27T09:55:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No, I'm 19.
[2023-09-27T09:55:52] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: And no I'm not studying yet.
[2023-09-27T09:56:13] Gabe Enzo: Ah I see.
[2023-09-27T09:56:38] Gabe Enzo: dont be too late then
[2023-09-27T09:58:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I cannot study yet. I have to get my high school diploma. I already got a lower-tier high school diploma, but not enough.
[2023-09-27T09:59:22] Mirono escooters: Owo
[2023-09-27T09:59:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Also I'm more the software engineer guy.
[2023-09-27T10:00:35] Mirono escooters: I suck at it so badly
[2023-09-27T12:12:46] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/commit/2d7ab3e1cf2e78eb2b3702ea985cf2e42367b799 oh that is nice
[2023-09-27T12:12:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: can show extra error on display
[2023-09-27T12:12:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: if adc is not configured properly or smth
[2023-09-27T12:15:30] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/commit/79c86db6e6ecaf107801f0bc74f3a299436522d8 new current sample mode
[2023-09-27T12:16:13] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: FOC_CONTROL_SAMPLE_MODE_V0_V7_INTERPOL hmm
[2023-09-27T12:17:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but no description on what it does
[2023-09-27T12:21:24] Rogerio Figueiredo: Hello guys any way to make screen ey3 from dual motor work with vesc?
[2023-09-27T12:22:10] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: A way is always there, but it is not worth to take it.
[2023-09-27T12:23:06] Rogerio Figueiredo: Why not?
[2023-09-27T12:23:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I mean have fun
[2023-09-27T12:23:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: If it works with ey4 and they use same settings should work with ey3 no
[2023-09-27T12:23:34] Rogerio Figueiredo: ?
[2023-09-27T12:27:23] cihan: Sorry for disrupting the conversation but how much balancing current will I need in a BMS? And 50A is probably going to be the most I'll ever need. I think about buying 100A BMS but is it better to buy 150A to have a futureproof BMS?
[2023-09-27T12:28:14] cihan: JK BD series is cheaper and at most they have 0.6 balancing current. Should I go for 1A or 2A?
[2023-09-27T12:28:18] Mirono escooters: If its a well build battery, 160ma balancing current is all u need
[2023-09-27T12:28:32] Mirono escooters: 0.6A is overkill already
[2023-09-27T12:29:34] cihan: Is this current for each series connected group? Can BMS use 0.6A from 2 different series connected group at the same time?
[2023-09-27T12:30:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: Jk balances only 2 cells together
[2023-09-27T12:31:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ant balances every cells I think
[2023-09-27T12:31:44] cihan: Thank you. JK was recommended as best option before. What's your opinion about the brand?
[2023-09-27T12:33:06] Konstantin: Jk active, very low speed. If battery big 20+. It's rake really much time to job... And y... it's balancing only 2 cells... For good battery, passive balance good choice. Active only recommend for lifepo4 cells
[2023-09-27T12:34:51] cihan: 0.6A or 1A shouldn't be very slow, don't you think so? I feel like Segway f2 pro has active BMS but not sure. Cells are always within 5mV difference and seeing that each time I check cell voltages makes me extremely happy. I got addicted to checking cell voltages.
[2023-09-27T12:45:35] Rogerio Figueiredo: I saw a git working with ey4 and vsett screen also
[2023-09-27T12:46:04] puneDir: isnt the packages same
[2023-09-27T12:46:21] S1m 0n: No
[2023-09-27T12:46:26] puneDir: oh
[2023-09-27T12:47:44] S1m 0n: driving in Germany under cannabis.. 2x 750‚Ç¨, 2x one month driving ban üòÇ
[2023-09-27T12:48:18] Gabe Enzo: Hahahahahaha
[2023-09-27T12:48:52] S1m 0n: Two Times in one Week
[2023-09-27T12:48:59] S1m 0n: That was my luck
[2023-09-27T12:49:06] Gabe Enzo: Lmao It's almost as if they're following you
[2023-09-27T12:49:09] Gabe Enzo: and they do
[2023-09-27T12:49:10] Gabe Enzo: trust me
[2023-09-27T12:49:15] S1m 0n: Otherwise i have to pay 500 + 1000 for second time
[2023-09-27T12:49:51] S1m 0n: 3rd Times 1500‚Ç¨
[2023-09-27T12:49:55] Gabe Enzo: How did they know you were stoned?
[2023-09-27T12:49:58] Gabe Enzo: Lmao
[2023-09-27T12:50:04] Gabe Enzo: You can pass eye tests when stoned easily
[2023-09-27T12:50:04] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: drug test?
[2023-09-27T12:50:15] Gabe Enzo: While scooting on the road?
[2023-09-27T12:50:16] Gabe Enzo: nah
[2023-09-27T12:50:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes
[2023-09-27T12:50:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: They tested me as well and I was not stoned, not drunk or anything.
[2023-09-27T12:51:10] Gabe Enzo: Oh yeah they use that blower thing
[2023-09-27T12:51:12] Gabe Enzo: that sucks
[2023-09-27T12:52:30] cihan: There are white cased ones and black cased ones. In general higher current ones are black. Is there a quality or circuit topology difference between them?
[2023-09-27T12:54:33] Rogerio Figueiredo: Right but if it works with new vsett screen should work with old one right?
[2023-09-27T12:54:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is legal in Germany smoke cannabis?
[2023-09-27T12:54:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No it is not.
[2023-09-27T12:55:18] Rogerio Figueiredo: Since the new screen works plug and play one old controller right?
[2023-09-27T12:55:29] Gabe Enzo: Trust me I get it, I've been smoking since 14. I love weed but it does lower your iq by half.
[2023-09-27T12:55:42] Gabe Enzo: That being said I still scoot while stoned
[2023-09-27T12:56:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: How this guy get it everyday lol

[2023-09-27T12:59:23] Mirono escooters: That's just sad to say to a fellow rider.
[2023-09-27T12:59:44] Mirono escooters: Going high speed on a G30 = smoking some weed and driving scoots
[2023-09-27T12:59:52] Mirono escooters: Both you do wrong. Stop pulling each other down.
[2023-09-27T13:00:27] S1m 0n: Lets wait still they catch zuna. Than the crying is big üòÑ

[2023-09-27T13:04:07] NetworkDir: Dir = Directory
[2023-09-27T13:04:36] Rogerio Figueiredo: The vsett is 60v
[2023-09-27T13:04:43] NetworkDir: Lmfao
[2023-09-27T13:04:48] NetworkDir: Sure
[2023-09-27T13:04:48] Rogerio Figueiredo: U have one also right
[2023-09-27T13:05:50] Rogerio Figueiredo: I know
[2023-09-27T13:06:52] NetworkDir: Yesterday, I was trying to make a display for vesc, and I saw that the compilation speed in Linux was 100 times that of Windows. Linux for 4ver
[2023-09-27T13:08:15] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: You got a driver licence?
[2023-09-27T13:08:31] S1m 0n: Never make it. I'm Always Cannabis lover
[2023-09-27T13:09:00] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Lmao okay
[2023-09-27T13:09:33] S1m 0n: Peace ü§ùü§ç
[2023-09-27T13:10:55] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I'm not nice if someone causes trouble for me. Otherwise I wouldn't care but as someone who gets stopped for drugs almost every time because of people like this...
[2023-09-27T13:12:23] S1m 0n: you judge people you don't know. They stopped me in regions like you live... remote. I don't take part in traffic because I prefer to drive quickly through the fields and generally don't feel like dealing with the police
[2023-09-27T13:12:43] Mirono escooters: Shut Up
[2023-09-27T13:13:12] Konstantin: No! 0.6/(n-1) == 0.6/(20-1)== around 30 mA!!! Karl!))) If all battery need to balance:)
[2023-09-27T13:13:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: So far works.
[2023-09-27T13:13:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I did try
[2023-09-27T13:14:01] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Only 2 today, third coming.
[2023-09-27T13:15:21] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I don't know. I am running it for 7 days so far.
[2023-09-27T13:16:28] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No I don't think so.
[2023-09-27T13:16:57] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But who knows. I tried debugging it but can't, as soon I ofc reupload it's gone
[2023-09-27T13:19:14] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes
[2023-09-27T13:19:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Nothing changed
[2023-09-27T13:19:24] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 6.02 just works
[2023-09-27T13:21:29] cihan: You're right. But it probably always starts balancing between highest voltage cell group and lowest voltage cell group. So total charge displacement of 1000mAh a week is probably all you need on regularly balanced battery. Then it takes an hour to balance a week or maybe an hour a day for an aged battery.
[2023-09-27T13:33:11] Applez Ontop: anyone reccomend monrim?
[2023-09-27T13:33:16] Applez Ontop: monorim*

[2023-09-27T13:34:29] Applez Ontop: both
[2023-09-27T13:34:35] Applez Ontop: also what about their batteries?
[2023-09-27T13:35:08] Rogerio Figueiredo: I don't know I imagine that works with more
[2023-09-27T13:35:20] Rogerio Figueiredo: Since the 75v version accepts like 100v
[2023-09-27T13:35:24] Rogerio Figueiredo: <photos/photo_9924@27-09-2023_13-35-24.jpg>
[2023-09-27T13:36:29] NetworkDir: Monorim battery? Shit
[2023-09-27T13:36:35] Applez Ontop: aight
[2023-09-27T13:36:41] Applez Ontop: cuz I need more range
[2023-09-27T13:36:50] Applez Ontop: what about the suspension
[2023-09-27T13:37:14] NetworkDir: Denis yurev battery packs probably good
[2023-09-27T13:38:26] Applez Ontop: yeah, but I live in new zealand so they dont ship here
[2023-09-27T13:38:33] Applez Ontop: hm?
[2023-09-27T13:38:46] NetworkDir: Might rear sharkset front monoshit
[2023-09-27T13:38:55] NetworkDir: Hmm
[2023-09-27T13:39:19] Applez Ontop: but is the suspension goo
[2023-09-27T13:39:38] Applez Ontop: from what I see, they only "good" suspension manafacturers are monorim
[2023-09-27T13:45:21] Applez Ontop: Imma go for the monorim front suspension
[2023-09-27T13:48:51] Rogerio Figueiredo: Thsy is why it aceppts more voltage?
[2023-09-27T13:50:15] Gabe Enzo: I haven't installed mine yet.
[2023-09-27T13:51:03] Rogerio Figueiredo: So maybe is better to install the 75100 on vsett
[2023-09-27T14:06:21] Applez Ontop: do you know what these options mean?
[2023-09-27T14:07:12] Gabe Enzo: I bought mine on Amazon so idk
[2023-09-27T14:07:18] Applez Ontop: oh
[2023-09-27T14:07:18] Gabe Enzo: they could be colour types
[2023-09-27T14:07:30] Applez Ontop: does it come with all the allen keys and other shit?
[2023-09-27T14:07:39] Gabe Enzo: You telling me you don't have those?

[2023-09-27T14:09:37] Gabe Enzo: Today I think
[2023-09-27T14:09:41] Gabe Enzo: skipped college today so I have time.
[2023-09-27T14:09:51] cihan: Do I ever need a dashboard if I have a JK BMS and a VESC controller else than turning on the lights?
[2023-09-27T14:10:41] cihan: I can also have the lights on all the time since that's how I always use the scooter to be more visible.
[2023-09-27T14:10:44] Applez Ontop: thanks
[2023-09-27T14:11:04] Applez Ontop: Im thinking of getting the v5
[2023-09-27T14:11:18] Applez Ontop: dunno what the difference is but bigger number = better?
[2023-09-27T14:11:23] cihan: I'm not sure if navee dashboard will be compatible with vesc BMS. It should be using UART.
[2023-09-27T14:12:56] Mirono escooters: Yeah
[2023-09-27T14:13:01] Mirono escooters: Just smol upgrades The suspension is still shit
[2023-09-27T14:13:21] Applez Ontop: so its not worth to buy?
[2023-09-27T14:13:31] Applez Ontop: becuz my stem is rattling like hell
[2023-09-27T14:13:42] Applez Ontop: and my area has bumy sidewalks
[2023-09-27T14:13:46] Applez Ontop: bumpy*
[2023-09-27T14:14:17] Applez Ontop: does it come with the springs
[2023-09-27T14:14:30] Mirono escooters: Fix that first
[2023-09-27T14:14:41] Mirono escooters: Bweh. Its.. ok.. Id get it only to fit a big motor in front
[2023-09-27T14:14:46] Mirono escooters: The only + of it
[2023-09-27T14:14:55] Applez Ontop: hmmm
[2023-09-27T14:15:17] Applez Ontop: what about cheap aliexpress versions?
[2023-09-27T14:15:34] Mirono escooters: Do even less
[2023-09-27T14:15:42] Mirono escooters: You should go more expensive, not cjeaperüòÇ
[2023-09-27T14:16:01] Applez Ontop: yeah lol, but if it isnt too much of a difference
[2023-09-27T14:16:08] Applez Ontop: any suspension kits you reccomend?
[2023-09-27T14:16:25] Mirono escooters: Konyk is the only answer
[2023-09-27T14:16:25] Applez Ontop: money isnt a problem upto 150 usd
[2023-09-27T14:16:37] Applez Ontop: wait i just saw the price

[2023-09-27T14:17:37] Applez Ontop: looks nice
[2023-09-27T14:17:39] Applez Ontop: the front
[2023-09-27T14:18:04] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-09-27T14:18:15] Mirono escooters: It just.. rides very high.. so you kinda need rear suspension too to level out
[2023-09-27T14:18:26] Mirono escooters: The only negative about C suspension on Xiaomi :/
[2023-09-27T14:18:39] Applez Ontop: <photos/photo_9927@27-09-2023_14-18-39.jpg>

[2023-09-27T14:19:26] Applez Ontop: so its not available yet, right?
[2023-09-27T14:20:36] Mirono escooters: It is
[2023-09-27T14:20:50] Mirono escooters: But if you need to level out rear, it won't fit budget Check out sharkset

[2023-09-27T16:19:01] S1m 0n: Cant belief. Not working on Kaabo. Understand Vsett more than one protocol ü§î
[2023-09-27T16:19:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: No verified, just seen that in some Facebook group
[2023-09-27T16:21:32] S1m 0n: I had an E3 display but couldn't do anything with it :/. I never tried to plug it into the Vsett controller... annoying
[2023-09-27T16:44:39] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @jamessoderstrom This is useful. Seems it does trigger error when it fails (?), just need to check or catch it and repeat or smth
[2023-09-27T16:47:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but idk if this read error is actually from the can-cmd or just vesc tool connection
[2023-09-27T17:00:21] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It is not from the function. It is somewhere else...
[2023-09-27T17:06:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Nothing to do with button handling.
[2023-09-27T17:06:45] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I'm still looking into the can cmd thing
[2023-09-27T17:07:40] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But my guess is that it might not be CAN causing issues but lisp repl . Vedderb did quite a lot of changes and seems he fixed issue with it in the new beta 16/17, so i might give it a try
[2023-09-27T17:09:35] sombre_enfant: Use the old script its good too
[2023-09-27T18:42:19] puneDir: what to do if you face with tank slapper with scooter

[2023-09-27T20:33:32] Mirono escooters: Exa price quality
[2023-09-27T20:33:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I take a look on this
[2023-09-27T20:34:06] NetworkDir: gt2p brake rotor ?
[2023-09-27T20:34:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yes
[2023-09-27T20:34:35] heimdler: Btw any recommendation for hydraulic caliper? Xtech? For 30-50kph
[2023-09-27T20:35:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Depends on what frame
[2023-09-27T20:35:43] heimdler: 1S with monorim rear or konyk
[2023-09-27T20:36:39] heimdler: At this speed, should brake changed to be at the motor?
[2023-09-27T20:37:31] heimdler: Currently brake at the rear, and motor at front. Got a feeling that better to have brake at motor
[2023-09-27T20:38:33] heimdler: At speed 30+ rear already skidding when car suddenly appear out of junction...
[2023-09-27T20:41:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: It's Always better to have both ,but if you willing to have front solutions, might bring some other problems
[2023-09-27T20:43:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like disc adapter needed Also something what would hold the brake and cheap solution if you buy a non sensor cheap Shimano full hidro
[2023-09-27T20:43:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Is this vesc powered?
[2023-09-27T20:48:24] heimdler: No, currently Xiaomi 1S with shfw. planning to go 500w motor, 54v 30pcs moli P42A 15s2p with modded Xiaomi esc
[2023-09-27T20:51:42] heimdler: Currently: motor front, stock brake rear Option #1: motor rear+rear hydraulic brakes Option #2: motor front+rear hydraulic brakes Option #3: motor front+both front & rear hrdraulic brakes What will be best advice?
[2023-09-27T20:52:49] heimdler: No problem, if best solution requires it I will get it installed
[2023-09-27T20:58:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well ,if you ask me 2 engine's 2 hidro brake's But would say change to pro or pro2 frame Or g30 More battery space Also can show contoller solutions, but you need to work a lot Also basically everything exist to make but cant say all stuff what can be bought are the best solutions.
[2023-09-27T21:00:16] heimdler: 2 motor requires two esc and exponentially more complex for me. I'm still focusing on having one esc for now. Later will go to vesc by swapping out the modded Xiaomi esc
[2023-09-27T21:01:09] heimdler: And there's still lot more room to play just by upgrading the 500w to 700w/1000w
[2023-09-27T21:02:05] heimdler: What's the suggestion for brake setup in terms of safety for single motor?
[2023-09-27T21:02:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well you cant just run any engine with that esc not enough power
[2023-09-27T21:02:39] Gabe Enzo: You need an adapter
[2023-09-27T21:02:44] Gabe Enzo: for front brake
[2023-09-27T21:02:51] Gabe Enzo: e brake + 2 discs
[2023-09-27T21:02:56] Gabe Enzo: that' 3 brakes
[2023-09-27T21:03:27] heimdler: In reference to 500w motor, with speed 30-50kph
[2023-09-27T21:03:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also awd Always performs better cant race that ,but you will learn
[2023-09-27T21:03:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Define brand?
[2023-09-27T21:03:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Monocrap?
[2023-09-27T21:03:55] heimdler: So you're suggesting additional brake for front, and both brakes with hydraulics (of course)
[2023-09-27T21:04:07] Gabe Enzo: I got up to 70 with my 300w.
[2023-09-27T21:04:10] heimdler: For now yes, later will look into rage machine or LongYu
[2023-09-27T21:04:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: In stock that has solid tires
[2023-09-27T21:05:07] heimdler: I'm on 10" tubed
[2023-09-27T21:05:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: üëÜ
[2023-09-27T21:05:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I was asking brand of 500w you talking about
[2023-09-27T21:05:42] heimdler: I'll go with monorim's 500w first
[2023-09-27T21:05:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You already have it modified?
[2023-09-27T21:06:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: üëÜ
[2023-09-27T21:06:16] heimdler: Not yet, I'm preparing
[2023-09-27T21:06:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Ok
[2023-09-27T21:06:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also i cant tell too much good About that engine
[2023-09-27T21:06:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What battery you have?
[2023-09-27T21:07:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: 10s?
[2023-09-27T21:07:06] heimdler: I've decided the following; 1. Monorim 500w 2. Xiaomi modded ESC (later will get vesc) 3. Moli 15s2p P42A 54v
[2023-09-27T21:07:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: 15s ok
[2023-09-27T21:07:59] heimdler: Now I'm planning for the brakes
[2023-09-27T21:09:13] heimdler: I'm thinking of swapping motor to rear+rear hydraulic brake. This is good enough?
[2023-09-27T21:10:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What you mean 54v?
[2023-09-27T21:10:30] heimdler: 3.6v √ó 15s
[2023-09-27T21:10:40] heimdler: Oh the battery
[2023-09-27T21:10:46] puneDir: 2p
[2023-09-27T21:10:49] puneDir: What
[2023-09-27T21:11:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: would do front hidro only And only engine brake on rear
[2023-09-27T21:11:49] heimdler: What is front hidro and engine brake?
[2023-09-27T21:12:26] heimdler: Sleeper... 21700 cell. No spacer
[2023-09-27T21:15:32] heimdler: You mean hydraulics brake at front, and rear just use e-brake?
[2023-09-27T21:15:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yes
[2023-09-27T21:15:50] heimdler: E-brake is KERS?
[2023-09-27T21:16:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Could say yes ,but that doesnt mean you want to recover any
[2023-09-27T21:17:05] heimdler: Hmm can set that with KERS on but with 0 recovery?
[2023-09-27T21:17:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You need to modify brake sensor on hidro brake since does are cut off only
[2023-09-27T21:17:49] heimdler: Any YouTube video on this?
[2023-09-27T21:17:59] Konstantin: Holy Polly ;)) Winter is coming.. from the ashes we will rise... Chance on success? xDD
[2023-09-27T21:18:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Unsure About it
[2023-09-27T21:18:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But basically you do this
[2023-09-27T21:18:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: <photos/photo_9936@27-09-2023_21-18-49.jpg>
[2023-09-27T21:19:14] heimdler: What does this do?
[2023-09-27T21:20:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Make magic from two pin cut off brake to be possible to use with 3 wire connector you have on ble for brake
[2023-09-27T21:20:47] Konstantin: Every time hurry...and don't wait, till pid reg accept iron temperature maping, and cooking on hi temp ;)
[2023-09-27T21:21:47] heimdler: What's the point of this? Sorry I still dont get it
[2023-09-27T21:21:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Or you need to buy a lever what has the mod and just plug it in
[2023-09-27T21:22:19] heimdler: A second brake lever on right side?
[2023-09-27T21:22:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: To be able to activate kers as you call it with same lever what you have for hidro
[2023-09-27T21:23:24] heimdler: But if I swap motor to rear, the rear rim will go to front with brakes you mean?
[2023-09-27T21:23:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You could keep the old also but no wire will hold it back like does now
[2023-09-27T21:23:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yes
[2023-09-27T21:24:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You said the setup i just gave answers near your ideas of setup
[2023-09-27T21:25:38] heimdler: Based on this, still can activate e brakes without modifying the brake sensor, no?
[2023-09-27T21:26:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If you keep old lever without that steel wire part since it will be connected to nothing
[2023-09-27T21:27:19] heimdler: The brake wire will also be changed to be at front with the rim, since motor swap to back
[2023-09-27T21:27:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Show what i mean
[2023-09-27T21:27:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Just on some shit clone i have here
[2023-09-27T21:28:17] Gabe Enzo: 2p is not enough. 10000mah is nothing. You need 3p.
[2023-09-27T21:28:34] heimdler: But moli P42A 4200mAh
[2023-09-27T21:28:37] Gabe Enzo: your batteries are gonna shut off when Its cold outside
[2023-09-27T21:28:58] heimdler: I live near the equators in SE Asia :)
[2023-09-27T21:29:02] Gabe Enzo: 8400mah. that's m365 capacity
[2023-09-27T21:29:19] Gabe Enzo: 3p and 4p bare minimum
[2023-09-27T21:30:04] heimdler: Sorry I don't get you, maybe my calculation is wrong. 15s2p is 30x4200mAh?
[2023-09-27T21:30:18] Gabe Enzo: parallel is what makes amp hours.
[2023-09-27T21:30:28] Gabe Enzo: Series is only voltage. nothing else.
[2023-09-27T21:30:39] Gabe Enzo: You're confusing aH with Wh
[2023-09-27T21:30:48] heimdler: I probably am
[2023-09-27T21:31:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: 2*4200 bro
[2023-09-27T21:31:59] heimdler: 8400mah at 54v with 500w, how many mileage does that give?
[2023-09-27T21:32:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Or you can hold lever
[2023-09-27T21:32:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like this
[2023-09-27T21:32:22] Gabe Enzo: 500w doesn't mean anything. that's just what the motor can operate at indefinitely
[2023-09-27T21:32:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Used awd vesc with no disc for a while like that
[2023-09-27T21:32:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: <video_file>
[2023-09-27T21:33:21] heimdler: 25km still possible?
[2023-09-27T21:33:21] Gabe Enzo: 8.4ah X 54v = 500wh (not alot Bro)
[2023-09-27T21:33:29] Gabe Enzo: Just barely. who knows
[2023-09-27T21:33:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also since its 500w on 48v its not even 500 for nowü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-09-27T21:33:49] heimdler: Yeah that's under 500w
[2023-09-27T21:33:54] Gabe Enzo: I get barely 40km when steamrolling 20s4p 900wh
[2023-09-27T21:34:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But bit more actually ,i mean with does numbers
[2023-09-27T21:34:28] Gabe Enzo: that 500w can handle 2000 peak and probably 900 constant.
[2023-09-27T21:34:41] Gabe Enzo: 300w has no trouble with 2kw peak (peak)
[2023-09-27T21:34:50] heimdler: Here's my issue
[2023-09-27T21:34:56] Gabe Enzo: but you're in a hot country so you're fucked. u don't get free cooling
[2023-09-27T21:35:15] heimdler: Going to need external
[2023-09-27T21:35:24] Gabe Enzo: Defeats the point of sleeper.
[2023-09-27T21:35:28] Gabe Enzo: Just make a deck extender.
[2023-09-27T21:35:39] Gabe Enzo: Make it black, it'll look stock
[2023-09-27T21:35:40] heimdler: 15s3p at min
[2023-09-27T21:35:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: For a while depends where you live , country and terrain,but same with awd no problem ,no struggle
[2023-09-27T21:35:51] Gabe Enzo: You might be able to squeeze it in
[2023-09-27T21:35:53] Gabe Enzo: Do the math
[2023-09-27T21:36:31] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_9938@27-09-2023_21-36-31.jpg>
[2023-09-27T21:36:36] Gabe Enzo: 15s3p easy fit (maybe idk)
[2023-09-27T21:36:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: He could buy or print
[2023-09-27T21:36:41] Gabe Enzo: Horizontally
[2023-09-27T21:38:01] heimdler: 15s3p still not enough, just only 680w
[2023-09-27T21:38:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Remember from above
[2023-09-27T21:38:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: This is why i said need bigger frame
[2023-09-27T21:38:59] heimdler: Let me get the power sorted
[2023-09-27T21:39:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: It's your stuff bro
[2023-09-27T21:39:27] heimdler: I'd probably need to go 18650 instead
[2023-09-27T21:39:43] heimdler: Smaller cell, more series
[2023-09-27T21:39:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Just normaly we dont build the small ones ,you loose space
[2023-09-27T21:40:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Bro you almost have Best cell possible for some high end shit
[2023-09-27T21:40:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Just saying
[2023-09-27T21:40:31] heimdler: But no power...
[2023-09-27T21:40:49] heimdler: Even with 3p, only 680w
[2023-09-27T21:41:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Coz you keep it small
[2023-09-27T21:41:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like 16s6 p possible in g30 frame if you get stock holders out
[2023-09-27T21:42:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And all is inside
[2023-09-27T21:42:06] heimdler: 21700?
[2023-09-27T21:42:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yes
[2023-09-27T21:42:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: @Mirono_escooters made it even with different s with stock frame parts kept
[2023-09-27T21:43:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Kinda loose 1p for it
[2023-09-27T21:43:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: 17s5p maybe was possible like that,but he will tell
[2023-09-27T21:44:04] Mirono escooters: Whatdidido
[2023-09-27T21:44:09] Mirono escooters: Oh yes, i fitted 18s5p
[2023-09-27T21:44:11] Mirono escooters: :)
[2023-09-27T21:44:30] Mirono escooters: Between rails, screw down, holders, Bluetooth BMS
[2023-09-27T21:44:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: On pro frame Unsure how much he can do if contoller bolted like in my awds
[2023-09-27T21:46:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: He gains lot space like that I think 78 cells from 21700 would surly fit standing with 2,5 cm spacer

[2023-09-27T21:48:56] Gabe Enzo: Don't buy those.
[2023-09-27T21:49:15] Gabe Enzo: Its comparable to buying lemonade at a stand instead of making your own
[2023-09-27T21:49:25] Gabe Enzo: you don't know the quality either
[2023-09-27T21:49:49] heimdler: It's from Denis
[2023-09-27T21:50:03] Gabe Enzo: is it a friend? if so go ahead
[2023-09-27T21:50:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And you have zero idea what you or who you are talking About ü§£
[2023-09-27T21:50:11] heimdler: Denis Yurev lol
[2023-09-27T21:50:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Kinda everybody behind him in a way ü§£ü§£üôà
[2023-09-27T21:50:35] Gabe Enzo: if it's guaranteed good then no issue.
[2023-09-27T21:50:58] heimdler: Ok wait it says 48v, how does that calculate?
[2023-09-27T21:51:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: 39
[2023-09-27T21:51:19] Gabe Enzo: where did you get 680 from? show me your math
[2023-09-27T21:51:45] Happy Giraffe: G30, buy
[2023-09-27T21:52:06] Gabe Enzo: Bro if we could've we would've
[2023-09-27T21:52:10] Gabe Enzo: There's a reason we don't
[2023-09-27T21:52:23] Happy Giraffe: If you need range you will be mad later beause you wasted money and time on a bad scooter
[2023-09-27T21:52:30] Happy Giraffe: Atleast M365 Pro
[2023-09-27T21:52:38] Gabe Enzo: he's making his own batt.
[2023-09-27T21:52:43] Gabe Enzo: Ri ght?
[2023-09-27T21:52:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If you read the link tells you 3 cell type possible, advertisement shows its Samsung 48g What means 13s3p
[2023-09-27T21:52:59] Happy Giraffe: Ordering yes
[2023-09-27T21:53:13] heimdler: Correct me, 15s x 3.6v x 4.2Ah x 3p
[2023-09-27T21:53:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I dont think so
[2023-09-27T21:53:28] Gabe Enzo: What amp draw specs do they have?
[2023-09-27T21:53:36] heimdler: From a semiconductor company yes
[2023-09-27T21:53:45] Gabe Enzo: oh it's the 42a yes
[2023-09-27T21:53:50] Happy Giraffe: 20-25A continuous without thermal probe
[2023-09-27T21:54:05] Gabe Enzo: Then it's 15S x 25 4000w bro
[2023-09-27T21:54:09] Gabe Enzo: Not 680 LOL
[2023-09-27T21:54:13] Happy Giraffe: ...
[2023-09-27T21:54:21] Gabe Enzo: oh wait
[2023-09-27T21:54:22] Gabe Enzo: I'm wrong
[2023-09-27T21:54:25] Gabe Enzo: wtf
[2023-09-27T21:54:28] Gabe Enzo: no sleep idiot
[2023-09-27T21:54:31] heimdler: Fuck me... you or I got me confused on the 4200 mAh and 42A
[2023-09-27T21:54:34] Gabe Enzo: i meant 54 X 25
[2023-09-27T21:54:48] Gabe Enzo: No still wrong
[2023-09-27T21:54:48] Gabe Enzo: omg
[2023-09-27T21:54:51] Gabe Enzo: 54 X 75
[2023-09-27T21:54:54] Gabe Enzo: THERE
[2023-09-27T21:54:56] Gabe Enzo: That's your peak
[2023-09-27T21:55:12] Gabe Enzo: lmao I was right.
[2023-09-27T21:55:16] Gabe Enzo: but accidentally
[2023-09-27T21:55:28] Happy Giraffe: Theres Voltage, Current, Power, Capacity. Remember their differences lol
[2023-09-27T21:55:36] heimdler: Fuck me, that's why I was confused why you said 4.2Ax2... I said moli P42A 4200mah
[2023-09-27T21:55:49] Gabe Enzo: They can output 42a with a thermal probe
[2023-09-27T21:55:55] Gabe Enzo: but 25 apparently is safe
[2023-09-27T21:56:08] Gabe Enzo: that was amp hours, that's different
[2023-09-27T21:56:09] heimdler: Ok so let's go back to 15s2p with moli 42A
[2023-09-27T21:56:23] Happy Giraffe: Not really, they heat a ton and have massive sag
[2023-09-27T21:56:42] Happy Giraffe: Will kill cell life early
[2023-09-27T21:56:47] heimdler: 15s √ó 3.6v √ó 42A √ó 2
[2023-09-27T21:57:01] Gabe Enzo: don't use 42a as example.
[2023-09-27T21:57:09] Gabe Enzo: 1zuna says 30a constant is stable
[2023-09-27T21:57:21] Gabe Enzo: but yes that's the formula.
[2023-09-27T21:57:34] Gabe Enzo: 15x3.6x30x2
[2023-09-27T21:57:40] Happy Giraffe: You gotta understand adding cell in series increases total voltage and parallel total capacity and the current output
[2023-09-27T21:58:00] Gabe Enzo: @heimdler study this like your life depends on it (it does)
[2023-09-27T21:58:27] heimdler: Modded Xiaomi esc in guide says can handle 30-50A
[2023-09-27T21:58:34] Happy Giraffe: Two horses side by side pull harder and longer
[2023-09-27T21:58:53] Happy Giraffe: Two in series create a faster horse doing 2x the speed but can only pull like a regular one
[2023-09-27T21:58:59] heimdler: So it's just 15s √ó 3.6v √ó 50A (max)
[2023-09-27T21:59:33] Konstantin: Depends which fets ...and how it install in frame...for temperature transmit
[2023-09-27T21:59:35] Gabe Enzo: Yes but you really need to reinforce that fucker
[2023-09-27T21:59:43] Gabe Enzo: CRSI and NCEP is fine
[2023-09-27T21:59:47] Gabe Enzo: although NCEP is more heat.
[2023-09-27T21:59:53] Gabe Enzo: have to make sure everything is good
[2023-09-27T22:00:00] heimdler: The same semi conductor company gonna do it, along with the moli batt
[2023-09-27T22:00:03] Gabe Enzo: Thermal pad for FETs and lots of paste
[2023-09-27T22:00:51] heimdler: They took apart the stock Xiaomi battery and they were in awe like it's so integrated their jaws dropped tho...
[2023-09-27T22:01:28] heimdler: And people in this chat group we have 16-19yo writing their own vesc script and modding the ESC and building their own batt
[2023-09-27T22:03:21] heimdler: With moli cell I'm good with 15s max and later with vesc (swap out the modded Xiaomi esc) that's already 4kW... does that represent 80kph? Too fast
[2023-09-27T22:04:15] heimdler: Now at 30+kph, next milestone is 50+kph
[2023-09-27T22:04:31] heimdler: Is it achievable with this setup?
[2023-09-27T22:05:05] Gabe Enzo: 20s is optimal.
[2023-09-27T22:05:08] Happy Giraffe: 15S2P Molicel P42A battery is... 54 nominal voltage (calculating with 3.6v x 15), 63V fully charged Will have capacity of 4.2Ah x 2 = 8.4Ah becuse two cells in PARALLEL Can store 529.2Wh of energy (63V x 8.4Ah) Can output power of roughly 2700w (54V x 50A ), 50A is from one cell being able to do 25A and there being 2 of them in parallel
[2023-09-27T22:05:24] Happy Giraffe: So if you are confused later on I will be mad
[2023-09-27T22:05:28] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-09-27T22:05:44] Gabe Enzo: 30kph is stock 10s bro
[2023-09-27T22:06:03] Gabe Enzo: Xiaomi engineering is so good
[2023-09-27T22:06:06] Happy Giraffe: 15s already does 45-50
[2023-09-27T22:06:07] heimdler: Haha 8.4Ah is capacity! Yes now it's clear and inline with what I already understand
[2023-09-27T22:06:24] Happy Giraffe: Save the message, you will need it...üòÇ
[2023-09-27T22:06:24] heimdler: Yes this is my next target
[2023-09-27T22:06:40] heimdler: Yeah, when I fucked myself over
[2023-09-27T22:07:28] heimdler: I know the community dislike repeating itself to the same clown ü§° @kafka is annoyed at me
[2023-09-27T22:08:21] Happy Giraffe: Just go watch some youtube videos about batteries
[2023-09-27T22:08:32] heimdler: Ok yes, so with this, now we can continue with the brake setup So i don't kill myself
[2023-09-27T22:10:27] Denis Yurev: <sticker>
[2023-09-27T22:11:03] Gabe Enzo: You need a front monorim adapter i personally ordered 2 today. So I'll have 2x discs and 2x ebrake.
[2023-09-27T22:11:07] Denis Yurev: welding by pure gold stripes
[2023-09-27T22:11:32] heimdler: Not copper?

[2023-09-27T22:12:50] Denis Yurev: <video_file>
[2023-09-27T22:12:50] heimdler: Yeah if the motor is to have a brake, I will get the monorim adapter
[2023-09-27T22:12:54] Happy Giraffe: All money wasted on regular m365
[2023-09-27T22:13:12] heimdler: Still can push to 80kph when I go vesc
[2023-09-27T22:13:17] Happy Giraffe: There you can fit bigger battery
[2023-09-27T22:13:18] Gabe Enzo: You need it. also are those guys gonna install 100v caps for e brake? cause if not you CAN'T use e brake at ALL.
[2023-09-27T22:13:34] Happy Giraffe: You dont want that on a tiny frame
[2023-09-27T22:13:52] Gabe Enzo: Install a board
[2023-09-27T22:13:54] heimdler: Pro2 and 1S difference only 4cm on the base

[2023-09-28T10:15:48] Konstantin: Diy kits ;)))))
[2023-09-28T10:56:30] Denis Yurev: So funny. Like when fat guy buys the most expensive running shoes)
[2023-09-28T10:57:18] heimdler: Oh how?
[2023-09-28T10:57:37] heimdler: You prefer ebooks?
[2023-09-28T10:58:25] heimdler: Or maybe you can teach me for free )))
[2023-09-28T10:58:51] Denis Yurev: Google can teach you for free
[2023-09-28T10:59:37] Denis Yurev: But you hope you just pay and the book do the job, no need to think, just plug a data cable into your brain
[2023-09-28T11:01:19] heimdler: That's what you think
[2023-09-28T11:01:20] Denis Yurev: When you need to repair something in your bathroom, will you buy a book "For beginners plumbers"?
[2023-09-28T11:01:54] heimdler: But I can't stop you from thinking so, becauase there's a culture where some groups just prefer to put people down instead of pushing them to go further
[2023-09-28T11:02:22] Konstantin: Y... like how to do all u staff. But then u paid...u save a lot of time and money... coz ...
[2023-09-28T11:02:23] Denis Yurev: Yeah, toxic people
[2023-09-28T11:02:31] heimdler: I expect someone respectable like you to have a growth mindset, it's more positive
[2023-09-28T11:03:20] Konstantin: Call ppl , they do it ;)
[2023-09-28T11:03:54] heimdler: But as I said, some people come from those kind of culture and that's how their mindset is, regardless I'm unperturbed, appreciate the feedback. And @kafka is still the nicest person from scooter community I know
[2023-09-28T11:13:24] heimdler: That said, if you share your knowledge and published a book, don't you think it'll be fair that I pay you for sharing your knowledge instead of keeping it to yourself? Don't you think it's fair that you should be fairly compensated back? If not, you'd be giving away all your batteries you make away for free instead of selling it to the community with your Rita and happy bms and making a profit @denis_yurev
[2023-09-28T11:47:18] Denis Yurev: Show your books collection
[2023-09-28T11:47:30] Denis Yurev: How to walk, how to fuck, how to be reach

[2023-09-28T13:11:04] Mirono escooters: Bruh, such a "professional" book is a way better start then fucking around and finding out Or scattering from internet
[2023-09-28T13:38:40] Happy Giraffe: Around page 58 should be good info for you
[2023-09-28T13:39:29] Happy Giraffe: Book is good but must read it slowly and do some google searches etc browse youtube for easier understanding
[2023-09-28T13:43:45] Denis Yurev: Lol, I know this breed of lazy non focused and passionless guys
[2023-09-28T13:43:58] Denis Yurev: I bet he will never build a battery
[2023-09-28T13:44:52] Denis Yurev: Today he decided to learn batteries, but not enough passion even for a little research
[2023-09-28T13:45:36] Denis Yurev: Tomorrow he decides to grow flowers and the book goes to archieve forever
[2023-09-28T13:45:48] Happy Giraffe: Denis has lost hope to humanity dealing with his customersüòÇ
[2023-09-28T13:45:50] Mirono escooters: Why bother? Let him be
[2023-09-28T13:45:55] Mirono escooters: Atleast he is trying

[2023-09-28T13:52:56] heimdler: I trust it's not that hard to build a 2s1p lol
[2023-09-28T13:54:52] Mirono escooters: If I can, you can
[2023-09-28T13:55:18] heimdler: We will make his mom proud, trust in Denis
[2023-09-28T13:55:21] Happy Giraffe: Where are you from? EU?
[2023-09-28T13:55:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Offland
[2023-09-28T13:55:34] heimdler: Malaysia
[2023-09-28T13:55:46] Happy Giraffe: Oh, then far away from reliable builders
[2023-09-28T13:55:49] heimdler: Any other Malaysian here?
[2023-09-28T13:56:08] heimdler: I met two builders, they see BMS they said no...
[2023-09-28T13:56:19] Happy Giraffe: Lol
[2023-09-28T13:56:45] heimdler: And we have 16 and 19 years old here building batteries and coding vesc
[2023-09-28T13:56:57] heimdler: I said vesc, they ask what?
[2023-09-28T13:57:12] heimdler: Idk if I'm in the right timeline of the past
[2023-09-28T14:06:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well ,lot ppl like to talk About it ,than scared to ask , talking about local ppl for nowüòÖ
[2023-09-28T14:09:17] heimdler: All these stupid talk are irrelevant but a distraction, thanks for the book recommendation
[2023-09-28T14:10:09] heimdler: As shared, the battery will first be build by certified engineers. I will learn about it while I also learn from them as they build it first by watching
[2023-09-28T14:23:47] Happy Giraffe: CN routed acid-proof steel torque arm. We didnt have a strong enough 3mm bit so gotta hand plasma cut opening to tighten it around 14x10mm axleüòÅ
[2023-09-28T14:25:21] Happy Giraffe: YupüòÇ I thought a slow feedrate would make it possible but this stuff is tanky. No way motor will ever do even the slightest bend to this stuffüòÇ "The steel gains its properties through various alloys, including chrome, nickel, manganese, titanium, niobium and molybdenum."‚ò†
[2023-09-28T14:27:32] Happy Giraffe: Bending this with m4/5 bolts even 0.3mm to tighten around axle will be a hell
[2023-09-28T14:29:00] Denis Yurev: Fuck, I am so jealous
[2023-09-28T14:29:19] Denis Yurev: that Happy has access to all the machines
[2023-09-28T14:30:46] Gabe Enzo: ikr
[2023-09-28T14:30:50] Happy Giraffe: Later when I learn to use them, just drop me an stl if you need something and I will do itüòÅ
[2023-09-28T14:31:07] Denis Yurev: <sticker>
[2023-09-28T14:31:17] francois schempers: @Happy_Giraffe when the time come, can I order you reinforced arms for my g2 ? üòÅüòÅüòÅüòò
[2023-09-28T14:31:34] Denis Yurev: can I order a steel gril?
[2023-09-28T14:31:55] francois schempers: for the BBQ üòÇ
[2023-09-28T14:32:27] Happy Giraffe: Sure, we also have a CN machine to bend thicker steel if needed. But I dislike doing bends as they need to be so damn precise for safety
[2023-09-28T14:33:35] Happy Giraffe: There was some polish guy making a big water purifying box, we thought it was to create drinkable spiritsüòÇ But I rather do bike/scooter parts
[2023-09-28T14:35:20] Happy Giraffe: Stainless steel rod welding tho I gotta practice more...üòÇ

[2023-09-28T14:52:23] puneDir: i want some chinese scooter for some reason

[2023-09-28T14:59:57] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes z10x very shit for battery space

[2023-09-28T15:08:53] francois schempers: without internal charger right ?
[2023-09-28T15:09:44] sombre_enfant: Yes no esc too
[2023-09-28T15:10:21] sombre_enfant: Better do 21s5p with alu pcb makerbase on side
[2023-09-28T15:11:00] francois schempers: what about 16s config with c350 esc ?
[2023-09-28T15:15:31] sombre_enfant: Why c350 for single ?
[2023-09-28T15:15:44] sombre_enfant: Or maybe put 70h instead
[2023-09-28T15:15:48] francois schempers: yes
[2023-09-28T15:16:27] francois schempers: with that motor https://rage-mechanics.com/moteurs-trottinettes-/1409-moteur-fht60.html
[2023-09-28T15:16:27] Konstantin: Not recommend using 21s on stock
[2023-09-28T15:16:54] Konstantin: Only after a little tune
[2023-09-28T15:17:00] sombre_enfant: Will heat alot since its torque winding
[2023-09-28T15:17:09] francois schempers: I'm not aiming for speed, I want high torque
[2023-09-28T15:17:51] francois schempers: I won't go faster than 50km/h, but I want to go up any road with ease
[2023-09-28T15:18:03] sombre_enfant: Take classic maybe way enough
[2023-09-28T15:18:32] sombre_enfant: Theres Thierry who do wheelie at start up with normal
[2023-09-28T15:18:36] francois schempers: <photos/photo_9949@28-09-2023_15-18-36.jpg>
[2023-09-28T15:19:02] francois schempers: that the kink of thing I want to go up, with 160kg between me and my gear
[2023-09-28T15:19:20] sombre_enfant: Well
[2023-09-28T15:19:47] Santiago: Hi guys this is Jan's arm plates for monorim suspension, I finished painting and applied varnish but I still can't get the paint to be as strong as monorim one against scratches, any tips???
[2023-09-28T15:20:21] francois schempers: anodize the metal itself ?
[2023-09-28T15:20:58] Mirono escooters: Very hard/impossible to do so at home
[2023-09-28T15:21:19] Mirono escooters: Maybe you can go to car shop, bake it
[2023-09-28T15:21:40] francois schempers: so, in your opinion, torque or classic ? and how much cell you think I can put beside the c350 ?
[2023-09-28T15:22:05] Santiago: Does this protect against rust?
[2023-09-28T15:22:53] francois schempers: what metal is it ? does it even rust in the first place
[2023-09-28T15:23:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If it will fail it will be the weld above, depends if there will be force direction changesüôå
[2023-09-28T15:24:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Probably in time you will need more than that ,some of them like to fall apart
[2023-09-28T15:25:03] Santiago: Steel
[2023-09-28T15:25:17] Santiago: Idk exactly what type
[2023-09-28T15:25:21] sombre_enfant: Classic, torque is way too slow, but even with high speed since u plan to use c350 who can push alot of amps
[2023-09-28T15:25:37] Jan: Its a carbon steel
[2023-09-28T15:26:23] francois schempers: outch worst kind for rust
[2023-09-28T15:26:45] Jan: And highest strength
[2023-09-28T15:26:52] Jan: Thats the tradeoff
[2023-09-28T15:27:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You only need tools and the knowledge,but not an easy one
[2023-09-28T15:27:27] francois schempers: if you can't manage to keep the paint on it, you could use lithium grease, it's thick enough that it won't go anywhere, a least it would be protected
[2023-09-28T15:28:34] Santiago: I'll fuck around and find out üòÅü§™ü§™
[2023-09-28T15:28:38] Santiago: Thanks guys
[2023-09-28T15:29:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Anodizing is not a paint ,hard to remove even ,harder than to remove paint
[2023-09-28T15:29:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Shit xtech has anodized coating also ,brake fails way earlier than the color
[2023-09-28T15:29:50] sombre_enfant: Plasti dip
[2023-09-28T15:31:39] Santiago: ü§£ü§£ü§£
[2023-09-28T15:32:09] Santiago: I can relate
[2023-09-28T15:39:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like look at this crap
[2023-09-28T15:39:57] S1m 0n: As a rule, the KTL technique (Cathodic dip painting) is used because it is the most durable compared to normal or powder painting
[2023-09-28T15:41:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: <video_file>
[2023-09-28T15:42:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Catholic?

[2023-09-28T15:45:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If we would live in a "titanium world " would be so easy
[2023-09-28T15:45:57] S1m 0n: KTL is German, CDC english üòÑ
[2023-09-28T15:47:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I am older , not familiar with new fancy name of drugs ü§£
[2023-09-28T15:48:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also wish i could do that home, also i am not far from it just lazy ass to play with that too
[2023-09-28T15:49:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Btw where is RS?
[2023-09-28T15:54:32] cihan: How long can you use scooter at 900W without damaging motor?
[2023-09-28T15:56:37] sombre_enfant: https://a.aliexpress.com/_EwgXDTH this on a xiaomi with mks75200 and 20s4p 21700?
[2023-09-28T16:01:21] Finn: What cells
[2023-09-28T16:03:20] sombre_enfant: 40t
[2023-09-28T16:05:53] Finn: Easy
[2023-09-28T16:06:05] Gabe Enzo: 900w? indefinitely.
[2023-09-28T16:06:32] Gabe Enzo: But I'm in a cold country so I'm cheating
[2023-09-28T16:06:46] Gabe Enzo: 700w (the stock peak) is stable too.

[2023-09-28T16:07:54] Gabe Enzo: hell even with 1.5kw it's fine for me. but it starts to overheat as soon as you turn on field weakening
[2023-09-28T16:08:14] puneDir: how to open this?
[2023-09-28T16:08:21] cihan: What's the temperature outside when operating motor at 900W continuously? And which model does this motor belong to?
[2023-09-28T16:08:31] Konstantin: .epub any e-book reader
[2023-09-28T16:08:39] Gabe Enzo: Pro 2 300w. Outside temp is normal
[2023-09-28T16:08:49] cihan: I use readera but any epub opening reader is fine.
[2023-09-28T16:08:50] Gabe Enzo: You get extra cooling when you snap off the plastic cover too
[2023-09-28T16:09:18] cihan: But it'll make motor too dirty, won't it?
[2023-09-28T16:09:38] Gabe Enzo: No, either way It doesn't matter, it's just a steel heatsink
[2023-09-28T16:09:45] Gabe Enzo: all the dirt flies off.
[2023-09-28T16:10:09] Gabe Enzo: with dual motor you can have 2kw in each one and itll be fine. but avoid field weakening
[2023-09-28T16:13:12] cihan: Why does field weakening causes overheat? It's supposed to run at same power but with less torque.
[2023-09-28T16:15:00] Mirono escooters: You add power
[2023-09-28T16:16:42] Gabe Enzo: Yes that's what I thought too but the papers are wrong.
[2023-09-28T16:16:52] Gabe Enzo: It just dumps more amps until the ESC blows
[2023-09-28T16:16:54] Gabe Enzo: useless
[2023-09-28T16:17:26] heimdler: Thanks, give a man a fishing rod and he's fed for life. But knowledge is forever, good to keep a hard copy
[2023-09-28T16:18:33] cihan: In general field weakening is used for higher RPM with less torque as I know. So he probably increases rpm more compared to decreased current.
[2023-09-28T16:19:39] cihan: Hard copy is always more enjoyable to feel the paper, I can't argue on that.
[2023-09-28T16:20:20] Gabe Enzo: We push it further than intended
[2023-09-28T16:20:52] cihan: That's strange. I thought you decrease current and increase rpm at same ratio to keep power constant. On the other hand without increasing power it's hard to go fast enough since drag increases a lot with speed.
[2023-09-28T16:21:19] Gabe Enzo: Yeah idk I still think every day how the hell the shit works but infact Fw = go faster and more heat
[2023-09-28T16:22:00] cihan: It's so as long as you use more power with field weakening.
[2023-09-28T16:23:56] Gabe Enzo: I don't understand
[2023-09-28T16:28:47] cihan: Can it do 40km/h without field weakening @900w?
[2023-09-28T16:33:27] Happy Giraffe: Try that, but you can't keep up that power consumption during ride. Thermistor installation is only way to know what happens inside of motor
[2023-09-28T16:34:00] Happy Giraffe: I guess xiaomi motors could stabilize themselves maybe at 300-350w for 1 hour load
[2023-09-28T16:34:32] Happy Giraffe: Much more with ferrofluid
[2023-09-28T16:35:19] Gabe Enzo: 60 with no field weakening.
[2023-09-28T16:35:24] Gabe Enzo: but I'm only 67kg
[2023-09-28T16:35:34] Gabe Enzo: feather
[2023-09-28T16:35:36] Happy Giraffe: I did 5 mins of riding at 1200w max power against wind with 36v and it was too hot to touch, would have burned my handüòÖ
[2023-09-28T16:35:40] Gabe Enzo: 20s***
[2023-09-28T16:35:51] Gabe Enzo: 72v X 7a I can get up to 58
[2023-09-28T16:36:00] Gabe Enzo: that's only 500w
[2023-09-28T16:36:16] Gabe Enzo: speed doesn't really change no matter the Amperages
[2023-09-28T16:36:24] Gabe Enzo: only the time it takes to get there
[2023-09-28T16:36:53] Gabe Enzo: You're heavy aren't you. also what country are you in?
[2023-09-28T16:38:30] cihan: It's pretty a lot. I don't think I'll ever reach that speed at 900W but even 50 is really enough for me.
[2023-09-28T16:41:06] cihan: In fact I rid 10km - 20 minutes pause and then 11km with stock ninebot f2 pro. The metal plate on motor was also hot to touch when I returned back. It was sunny and noon, 26 degrees outside. I think it was using 450W most. But my usual ride is 2-3 km at most so 900W continuous power probably will work fine for me while it's below 10 degrees celcius outside in winter.
[2023-09-28T16:42:07] cihan: Efficiency decreases without field weakening at high speeds probably.
[2023-09-28T16:43:07] Happy Giraffe: It was against wind, then nothing helps and scooter has to sweat a lot. Was on flat ground evenüòÖ
[2023-09-28T16:43:12] cihan: Excuse me, what does 22 and 3 represent?
[2023-09-28T16:46:26] Gabe Enzo: Correct I believe
[2023-09-28T16:46:29] Gabe Enzo: Its all subjective
[2023-09-28T16:58:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: will work well

[2023-09-28T17:38:31] francois schempers: 16s7 or 8p depending if it can fit, molicel p45 and 200A bms it's to accommodate a c350 Vesc
[2023-09-28T17:47:21] francois schempers: that's the motor though
[2023-09-28T17:48:44] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes
[2023-09-28T17:48:56] francois schempers: this is torque version, they are normal and speed version too, but I don't want speed, I want pure torque üòÇüòÇ I want to go up mountains without overheating

[2023-09-28T18:04:23] Mirono escooters: Not much
[2023-09-28T18:04:49] francois schempers: 300mah
[2023-09-28T18:05:01] Nik: discharge performance wise too
[2023-09-28T18:07:18] francois schempers: I'll go with standard and we will see üëå I'll have anyway to modifier both front and back fork to fit it, so I'll do one at a time

[2023-09-28T18:22:53] cihan: X Wh capacity battery with good heat dissipation vs 2X capacity hot melt glue combined battery with very bad heat dissipation for short ranges? Max 5 km and at most X W usage.
[2023-09-28T18:23:55] Gabe Enzo: LOL
[2023-09-28T19:02:19] Happy Giraffe: P45B gives ~10A more continuous current
[2023-09-28T19:02:38] Happy Giraffe: Overall higher power, less internal resistance, higher capacity...
[2023-09-28T19:32:25] Jan: Actually looks really decent
[2023-09-28T22:20:56] –î–∞–≤–Ω–æ –ø–æ—Ä–∞: does anyone has mantis deck raiser stl?
[2023-09-28T22:25:20] Mirono escooters: Somewhere. üôà
[2023-09-28T22:37:41] S1m 0n: Yes
[2023-09-29T00:44:26] cihan: Just a note about Ninebot f2 pro : I first changed the fourth digit of serial number to increase speed to 32 km/h and then I updated the firmware to latest version and it's still 32km/h. According to my experience, it reaches 32km/h easier after firmware update. There is like a power boost after 20km/h now which didn't happen with factory firmware.
[2023-09-29T00:46:09] cihan: Can't we make brake lights work without ADC adapter?
[2023-09-29T01:10:01] cihan: Thank you. I'm still searching what I should get and how to assemble it. I have already made up my mind to get JK BMS and probably 150A output 24S and 1A balance current but I should check space under the deck. I would like to buy it and use forever. Manual tells it works at least with 14 series cells but it works with 13 too as I've seen it. I cannot decide about Ubox or alternative. Alternatives are cheaper. Should I somehow have a switch to shut down BMS to preserve battery power when not in use? JK claims 10mA current usage at 100V and it's not very little. And I'm still not sure if I can use navee screen with vesc. I think I don't need a screen at all but screen can be useful if I can use it to turn on lights together with throttle of navee. I'm also not sure if I'll be able to use navee throttle and buttons on it.
[2023-09-29T01:23:45] francois schempers: yeah g2 is different, 1.4.8 lowered the torque on g2
[2023-09-29T01:27:54] cihan: It's sad. By the way 36V is insufficient for f2 pro. It's acceleration is weaker when battery is lower than 40%. Under 20% battery, it's more like riding navee n65.)) But all in all I'm quite happy after navee n65. I can catch up with the cars at traffic lights until 32km/h, throttle response is fast. These make riding in traffic much easier. I had to wait for cars all the time with navee n65. I don't know why I bought navee, it was praised a lot. But there's nothing good about it except well built chassis and 3'' tires. And I love active BMS in f2 pro. Seeing all cells at same voltage is something extremely satisfactory, I just check voltages to feel satisfied time to time. Although they are both declared as 900W, f2 pro has more torque compared to navee. I feel and see it on dashboard easily when going uphill with battery over 50% charge.
[2023-09-29T01:31:00] cihan: On long term I can maybe change the bearings of tires and rewind navee motor to increase torque.
[2023-09-29T01:34:39] francois schempers: will be better when we have acces to cfw, but in the meantime, I'll have changed everything in the g2 before that happens üòÇüòÇ
[2023-09-29T01:40:27] cihan: I think someone will make custom firmware for it. But I don't think they'll make a custom firmware for f2 pro. I think they only find it worth working for max series. So I'm sure I'll change controller when battery of f2 pro dies. I like it's motor, I also drive short distances so I'll use it with high power in winters.
[2023-09-29T01:42:00] francois schempers: @cihanbozkir they are ;)
[2023-09-29T01:42:00] francois schempers: We are working on porting our from source code compiled firmware to the new models.... Like G2, F2, F65, P Series.... But we have to implement and adapt all new controller features (indicators, NFC etc...) That takes time and we need to test them extensively.... So we can't tell you how long it's gonna take .... Installation will be probably only possible with stlink... And reverting back to stock firmware is also not guaranteed as accessing official firmware is not as easy as before.
[2023-09-29T01:42:45] cihan: If max g2 was sold for same price of 800 USD in Turkey, I'd pick it over f2 pro without hesitation. I paid 600 usd for new f2 pro and new max g2 costs like 1200 usd here.
[2023-09-29T01:44:07] cihan: I've also read it. I check Xiaodash group everyday but if you check past messages, you'll see that Noone has intention to work on f2 pro. America price of f2 pro and max g2 is very similar. Noone will buy f2 pro in USA with those prices. I didn't check Europe prices though.

[2023-09-29T20:57:24] KierreKikkeli: XD
[2023-09-29T21:22:25] KierreKikkeli: ah, it refuses to take solder

[2023-10-01T02:53:28] Rogerio Figueiredo: Are you using vesc on that?
[2023-10-01T02:53:39] KierreKikkeli: I think the gas handle has those too + speedmodes and remember something about fog light switch
[2023-10-01T02:54:09] haku: Yes im using a spintend dual 100/100 ubox v2.
[2023-10-01T02:54:26] haku: Im still figguring out stuff.
[2023-10-01T02:54:28] Rogerio Figueiredo: Uau
[2023-10-01T02:54:46] Rogerio Figueiredo: Whith stock battery or you change it?
[2023-10-01T02:55:08] Dexter: Could the fog light button be wired to a bad boy Chinese led that is powered by the main battery? That is the dream
[2023-10-01T02:55:25] haku: Stock battery for now but i will be building a 72v molicell pack in october
[2023-10-01T02:55:41] KierreKikkeli: Why not if the volts align
[2023-10-01T02:55:58] Rogerio Figueiredo: With vesc you before choose pairs and now with new ones is poles right?
[2023-10-01T02:56:33] Rogerio Figueiredo: Very nice in thinking is put vesc on one before but the people tell that is bad Frame
[2023-10-01T02:56:43] Rogerio Figueiredo: I'm. Using vesc on a laotie es10p
[2023-10-01T02:57:09] KierreKikkeli: Dude ihave a ubox and vsett 10+ on an xiaomi essential ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
[2023-10-01T02:57:15] KierreKikkeli: Sky is the limit
[2023-10-01T02:58:00] haku: Yes. Ive heard it is a bad frame. I only got it for $700 new. Im trying to do a budget vesc scoot.
[2023-10-01T02:58:41] KierreKikkeli: Xiaomi essential and ubox with vsett and adc v2
[2023-10-01T02:59:01] KierreKikkeli: And a 12s, Thats a budget scoot
[2023-10-01T02:59:08] haku: I like that there is so much room in the deck though. Can fit a 22s pack if needed
[2023-10-01T02:59:48] haku: I bet its really smooth with the vesc
[2023-10-01T03:00:50] KierreKikkeli: I have both monorimms so suprisingly yes, my vesc settings are just pure carbage pretty much
[2023-10-01T03:01:44] KierreKikkeli: Or the poles and all are wrong with no profiles either
[2023-10-01T03:02:19] KierreKikkeli: So according to vesc tool im driving 200kmh while gps says 45-50kmh xd
[2023-10-01T03:09:11] Rogerio Figueiredo: Very nice price how do you get that?
[2023-10-01T03:10:47] Rogerio Figueiredo: Lol
[2023-10-01T03:10:58] Rogerio Figueiredo: I have 75100 and vsett motor no xiaomi pro2
[2023-10-01T03:13:10] haku: The site bangood were running a clearance sale. I couldnt say no to that price
[2023-10-01T03:13:49] KierreKikkeli: I might upgrade my body at somepoint to pro aswell at somepoint, had a look at used e scoot market a few days ago trying to sell my old parts and found out no ones buying anything and the scoots/bodies are being sold for like 100-200‚Ç¨ bucks, could literally build a roided up essential + vsett ubox and stuff on a pro 2
[2023-10-01T03:15:03] Rogerio Figueiredo: Never saw that price unfortunately
[2023-10-01T03:15:48] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yes pro are more difficult to find since there aro no copy's of pro frame
[2023-10-01T03:16:21] KierreKikkeli: Yeah they just selling actual legit ones for that price
[2023-10-01T03:16:53] KierreKikkeli: Used market here in finland sucks ass so bad they have to and still wont sell üòÇüòÇ
[2023-10-01T03:17:19] haku: I saved the photo
[2023-10-01T03:17:25] Rogerio Figueiredo: I wand g30 frame and is more difficult to find
[2023-10-01T03:17:35] Rogerio Figueiredo: I believe in you my friend
[2023-10-01T03:18:00] haku: üëç
[2023-10-01T03:18:00] Rogerio Figueiredo: Where you from?
[2023-10-01T03:18:11] haku: Las vegas nevada
[2023-10-01T03:21:51] Rogerio Figueiredo: Oh they make better prices for eua
[2023-10-01T03:21:56] Rogerio Figueiredo: Don't now why
[2023-10-01T10:05:01] Gabe Enzo: does anyone have a link to an indicator set?
[2023-10-01T10:05:25] Gabe Enzo: like the lights and shit.
[2023-10-01T10:06:08] Gabe Enzo: yes indeed
[2023-10-01T10:17:16] haku: Hi james! Where can i add plug in a voltmeter?
[2023-10-01T10:18:08] Gabe Enzo: the ones I see are shit.
[2023-10-01T10:22:21] haku: Thanks alot.
[2023-10-01T11:09:13] Yamal: Hey everyone , great to be in this group, greetings from south of Spain üî•
[2023-10-01T11:37:29] Pablo Fernandez: where u from?
[2023-10-01T11:38:08] Jes√∫s: <video_file>
[2023-10-01T11:38:36] Jes√∫s: Are those values supposedly only from a controller?
[2023-10-01T11:39:40] Jes√∫s: <photos/photo_9966@01-10-2023_11-39-40.jpg>
[2023-10-01T11:47:18] Yamal: Granada
[2023-10-01T11:54:13] Pablo Fernandez: yo de sevilla, me sonabas del grupo de dualtron ya decia yo jajaja
[2023-10-01T11:54:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No, they are from two controllers.
[2023-10-01T11:55:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: When connected together it will show it like that.
[2023-10-01T11:58:08] Jes√∫s: It‚Äôs weird because he‚Äôs only reading one, the watt motor is only one I don‚Äôt understand it
[2023-10-01T11:59:24] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: What?
[2023-10-01T12:01:02] Jes√∫s: Is this the sum of the 2 controllers?
[2023-10-01T12:01:11] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes
[2023-10-01T12:02:06] Jes√∫s: I don‚Äôt understand power max 15k between the 2 engines?
[2023-10-01T12:02:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes max what you pulled from your battery?
[2023-10-01T12:04:31] Jes√∫s: My battery gives more than 300A
[2023-10-01T12:04:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Drive faster.
[2023-10-01T12:05:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: You won't pull much at ehm 38km/h üòÇ
[2023-10-01T12:05:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: And check your battery current limit on both ESC.
[2023-10-01T12:08:19] Jes√∫s: It was only a test in 20 meters of exit only.
[2023-10-01T12:17:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs for sure 2 controller, tronic 250 don‚Äôt supporto 450 phaseüòÇ
[2023-10-01T12:22:41] Yamal: in tronic 250r controller It would be approximately 250A phase per controller..?
[2023-10-01T12:29:21] Yamal: Paolo Wu, you are the man who supplies the entire world with electric motors, right? glad to see you in this group, what electric scooter do you use? greetingsüòÅ
[2023-10-01T12:30:02] Santiago: Greetings from M√°laga üòú
[2023-10-01T12:32:09] Pablo Fernandez: bit off topic but any recomendation for motor/brake cables sleeves? got one but they were trash quality, i dont mind the price
[2023-10-01T12:38:25] S1m 0n: https://a.aliexpress.com/_EuVy8aP https://a.aliexpress.com/_EIqlfFz I like these.. TPU spiral and PET braided sleeving
[2023-10-01T12:43:36] S1m 0n: The scooter has been outside in wind and weather for 1¬Ω years. the sleeves have not lost any quality üëç
[2023-10-01T12:44:24] Pablo Fernandez: they look really good, i got one from ali that were like "plastic" sleeves and holy they were pure trash
[2023-10-01T13:27:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 2khz vesc üòÇ
[2023-10-01T14:47:05] Gabe Enzo: anyone know what I should use as phase wire + hall wire sleeves?
[2023-10-01T14:47:05] Gabe Enzo: I've been thinking of using old clothes
[2023-10-01T14:47:18] Mirono escooters: Define sleeves
[2023-10-01T14:47:41] Happy Giraffe: @Megacorporate
[2023-10-01T14:47:47] Gabe Enzo: cable to shield the motor wires. otherwise the hall wires will just all be flipping around and that's dangerous.
[2023-10-01T14:48:11] Gabe Enzo: i had to get rid of the original because I changed all wires
[2023-10-01T14:48:44] Gabe Enzo: I'll see
[2023-10-01T14:49:09] Gabe Enzo: I mean like something I can use right now you know? I can't wait weeks for a piece of plastic to arrive.
[2023-10-01T14:49:27] Mirono escooters: Tis on Amazon too
[2023-10-01T14:49:32] Mirono escooters: Just use a lot of shrinkwrap? Xd
[2023-10-01T14:51:18] Gabe Enzo: Thanks tho I'll order that.
[2023-10-01T14:51:18] Gabe Enzo: For next project
[2023-10-01T14:52:58] NetworkDir: Try at bldc mode
[2023-10-01T14:53:06] NetworkDir: Start sound so cool
[2023-10-01T14:53:11] NetworkDir: Also shit
[2023-10-01T14:53:15] NetworkDir: Noise
[2023-10-01T14:53:27] NetworkDir: Best pwm freq 20-30KHz
[2023-10-01T14:54:59] Gabe Enzo: ran out bro and I'm not getting paid for 2 weeks
[2023-10-01T14:55:09] Gabe Enzo: can't buy silicone to fix my motor either
[2023-10-01T14:55:10] Gabe Enzo: I'm genuinly so fucked
[2023-10-01T14:55:29] Mirono escooters: F
[2023-10-01T14:55:57] Gabe Enzo: So I gotta go college on my shit Kugoo G4 which I can't reprogram and it isn't limited by amps but speed. meaning I have to crawl slowly or my batt dies.
[2023-10-01T14:56:07] Gabe Enzo: 30kmh max speed or batt dies during the 45km trip. absolute doodoo
[2023-10-01T14:56:14] Gabe Enzo: advertised as 70km range
[2023-10-01T14:56:29] Gabe Enzo: Then I opened the manual and it says 70km range on ECO (locked to 20kmh)
[2023-10-01T14:56:41] Mirono escooters: Obviously
[2023-10-01T14:56:43] Gabe Enzo: I don't have cash for a Vesc either. so I can't fix the firmware problem
[2023-10-01T14:57:14] Gabe Enzo: so I can't even use full throttle.
[2023-10-01T14:57:19] Gabe Enzo: <voice_message>
[2023-10-01T14:57:37] Gabe Enzo: maybe I will buy a used Vesc off one of the guys.
[2023-10-01T14:57:43] Mirono escooters: Meh
[2023-10-01T14:58:16] Gabe Enzo: Btw you can setup a gear button for vesc yes? using any type of dash? The issue would be solved with a Xiaomi dash no?
[2023-10-01T14:58:21] Gabe Enzo: Like 3 modes yk?
[2023-10-01T14:58:37] Gabe Enzo: 3 modes is kinda shit. there should be 5 üòÇ
[2023-10-01T14:58:57] Mirono escooters: Most of us use 1
[2023-10-01T14:59:07] Gabe Enzo: wouldn't that be incredibly inefficient
[2023-10-01T14:59:09] Gabe Enzo: haha
[2023-10-01T14:59:17] Gabe Enzo: I suppose Vesc is different
[2023-10-01T15:09:57] KierreKikkeli: Spintend adc 2 + throttle
[2023-10-01T15:10:09] KierreKikkeli: For 3 modes
[2023-10-01T16:25:28] KierreKikkeli: unless you use adc v2 which uses the comm port of the vesc, so youd need to do a splitter and hope it works
[2023-10-01T16:32:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: To have 3 modes on vesc like that is possible with a swich like that but kinda reasonless ,if you understand how does work , better setup some profiles and done
[2023-10-01T17:10:33] Mirono escooters: Today I potted my esc for waterproof reasons (but the extra thermal conductivity is nice.) I can recommend this seller, nice product, now we have to see how goof it conducts heat. https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_m0Q0h5G
[2023-10-01T17:14:50] Simone: Fill or only apply on esc?
[2023-10-01T17:20:07] Mirono escooters: Fill
[2023-10-01T17:20:13] Mirono escooters: Because I potted my battery and I had epoxy left
[2023-10-01T17:20:16] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_9970@01-10-2023_17-20-16.jpg>
[2023-10-01T17:22:49] Simone: Let's hope you never have to open it üòÖ
[2023-10-01T17:23:14] Mirono escooters: The battery won't ever be opened If it dies, it's trash
[2023-10-01T17:23:22] Mirono escooters: It's because I used no wrap, because micro mm margins
[2023-10-01T17:23:27] Mirono escooters: So I had to pot it to make it safe
[2023-10-01T17:23:37] Mirono escooters: And the extra performance boost/shock absorbing/water protection is just nice
[2023-10-01T17:23:49] Mirono escooters: And the Esc is a 30‚Ç¨ china Esc, for my bike. So
[2023-10-01T17:32:13] Gabe Enzo: Lol having a Xiaomi dash on a Kugoo will be goofy as hell
[2023-10-01T17:32:44] Gabe Enzo: wym by pot the battery?
[2023-10-01T17:32:57] Gabe Enzo: Send it to me bro no joke I'll take it
[2023-10-01T17:33:04] Gabe Enzo: anytime.
[2023-10-01T17:34:11] Mirono escooters: Full of epoxy
[2023-10-01T17:34:18] Mirono escooters: You want old batteries?
[2023-10-01T17:34:35] Gabe Enzo: Ah too much work for me then.
[2023-10-01T17:34:44] Gabe Enzo: Yea depends how much is in there.
[2023-10-01T17:35:02] Gabe Enzo: usually when one stack fails the batt dies. The other 19 pairs are fine
[2023-10-01T17:35:24] Mirono escooters: I've got shelves full
[2023-10-01T17:35:24] Mirono escooters: XD this batt is for me no you ;9
[2023-10-01T17:35:28] Gabe Enzo: probably costed more than the battery itself.
[2023-10-01T17:35:39] Mirono escooters: Bah, 30‚Ç¨ 600g or smth
[2023-10-01T17:35:43] Mirono escooters: Still enough but
[2023-10-01T17:35:43] Mirono escooters: Worth it
[2023-10-01T19:30:47] Yamal: Hello who have Rion in this group..?
[2023-10-01T19:39:45] Jan: Why?
[2023-10-01T19:42:40] Happy Giraffe: Xiaomi > Rion
[2023-10-01T19:42:44] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-10-01T19:48:02] Zak: Rion doesn't exist in the wild
[2023-10-01T19:58:49] Yamal: I am interested in knowing about the Rion community in Europe, I have a friend who has one, and I think it is an impressive scooter, I currently have a Nami with a Kelly 7218, but I don't rule out switching to Vesc in the near future
[2023-10-01T20:01:27] Yamal: I see the things they do and impress! Congratulations, but what we are looking for is the combination of everything: extreme acceleration with a good top speed and a beautiful design
[2023-10-01T20:03:22] Yamal: and personally, I would never prepare a xaomi in my life, It's structurally sad, and sometimes it's scary to go 130km/h on a "big" scooter... on a xiaomi?üòÅüî•üëç
[2023-10-01T20:04:35] Yamal: I am looking forward to learning from you and learning the wonderful world of VescüöÄ
[2023-10-01T20:15:32] Mirono escooters: Well, no one went 130 on Xiaomi Yet.
[2023-10-01T20:16:23] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Eh but I think it's solid enough
[2023-10-01T20:35:50] Jes√∫s: I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôve ridden one yet üòÇ
[2023-10-01T20:41:17] francois schempers: <video_file>
[2023-10-01T20:50:45] Jan: Nobody ever made a public measurement of a Rion
[2023-10-01T21:00:07] Happy Giraffe: You forgot the smokes and torches
[2023-10-01T21:03:59] Jes√∫s: What I shared was only a few meters of exit, I didn't give it a hard time at all, only 30%
[2023-10-01T21:23:31] Jes√∫s: OK, I‚Äôll share it someday.
[2023-10-01T21:52:31] Jan: October23?
[2023-10-01T21:53:14] Jan: People are waiting for some Rion measurements since the big bang
[2023-10-01T21:59:38] Pablo Fernandez: Many problem with rion is lack of real world testing in the long run
[2023-10-01T22:09:35] Happy Giraffe: Many engineers havent felt the grass in years it seems
[2023-10-01T22:09:56] Happy Giraffe: So many basic errors in design on so many different products today
[2023-10-01T22:12:54] KierreKikkeli: Installed the powerbutton properly with a new screen cover, was wondering why no lights came on at all but it was working, only to find out spintend didnt want to solder the led wire.... it was making contact with solely the heatshrink and hope XD
[2023-10-01T22:14:18] KierreKikkeli: Thought my soldering was the issue or a broken wire so tore up the heatshrinks and all until i tested multimeter continuety XD
[2023-10-01T22:17:39] KierreKikkeli: Was connected with 1 thread of the wire, at least their quality control is persistent through all components XD
[2023-10-01T22:55:44] KierreKikkeli: Fuck button contacts that have no wire holes xd
[2023-10-01T22:56:11] KierreKikkeli: It nows has a ring connector soldered on it
[2023-10-01T23:12:30] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9975@01-10-2023_23-12-30.jpg>
[2023-10-01T23:13:08] Simone: outdated and old stuff...once upon a time it was impressive...now it's just a big trick üòÇ
[2023-10-01T23:13:19] KierreKikkeli: <animation>
[2023-10-01T23:22:10] Tommy: Old and hardüòÅ
[2023-10-01T23:23:23] Simone: more or less like this?
[2023-10-01T23:23:23] Simone: <video_file>
[2023-10-01T23:23:29] Simone: <animation>
[2023-10-01T23:36:53] cihan: I know this, even a similar but 4000W model was sold for 500 USD and it was Greece only. If you can catch, there are such incredible discounts from local warehouse.
[2023-10-01T23:39:58] cihan: Which app is this?
[2023-10-01T23:40:49] Jan: Master garbage, these are the category of scooters that gives everyone a bad name. The ones that blow up because of cheap batteries and chargers, causing fires until everything is forbidden. The ones to unsafe for the power, the ones we should not create a demand as they destroy the reputation of the scooter community.
[2023-10-01T23:40:52] KierreKikkeli: Vesc tool
[2023-10-01T23:42:28] cihan: Is Laotie and similar ones with different names really that bad?
[2023-10-01T23:42:59] Jan: Im not accusing a branf of being brand, but a product ideology
[2023-10-01T23:43:13] Jan: The cheapest ass product with highest stats
[2023-10-01T23:43:15] cihan: In fact I never used a really bad scooter but I like Ninebot after I got f2 pro. Controller response and BMS is much better.
[2023-10-01T23:44:39] cihan: If it's that bad, you're right. In fact I've never used a bad lithium ion too, they can be really bad on lygte-info.dk reviews. Such cells are not acceptable even if they are safe. I have only used Sony vtc6 and was always happy.
[2023-10-01T23:49:07] haku: Cant pass up that deal
[2023-10-01T23:50:09] Mirono escooters: Laotie is pretty ok price quality wise
[2023-10-01T23:50:20] haku: Not everyone can afford a 4k scooter. This brand gives it for less. Kinda like walmart brand
[2023-10-01T23:51:04] Jan: Agree, but also dont complain when stricter laws are enforced against scooters
[2023-10-01T23:51:14] Jan: Taking scooters inside buildings for example
[2023-10-01T23:51:25] cihan: I also wouldn't pass it if I could buy 30Ah, 3600W scooter for 500 USD. I would probably do some modifications
[2023-10-01T23:53:04] haku: I will worry when its it comes to the US. But now im savimg money to buy better modifications like molicel batteries. Tell me wich scooter companies have vesc and molicell for less than 3k?
[2023-10-01T23:54:01] Mirono escooters: None, for a reason lol
[2023-10-01T23:54:10] Jan: Nobody builds commercially on vesc as i know of except Rion. Molicel is also for some reason completely unknown to the industry
[2023-10-01T23:54:55] Jan: I think vesc makes absolutely sense commercially when you are in a low production number and locking the hardware+software
[2023-10-02T00:00:19] haku: Yep. Thats my point. Just use the frame and motor get vesc and good bms/batteries. Save $$
[2023-10-02T00:02:46] cihan: By the way I started thinking using the old battery from Navee n65 as a back up for my aunt's ventilator, cells aren't unsafe to keep at home probably. I don't know where I can use the old battery.
[2023-10-02T00:04:20] haku: Check internal resistance and capacity if its still good. Im sure it will be ok for non high draw applications.
[2023-10-02T00:05:20] cihan: I'll check, it should be good. I only used it for 900km.
[2023-10-02T00:06:43] cihan: Does anyone know if there's significant difference between makerbase 75100 v1 and v2?
[2023-10-02T00:17:57] NetworkDir: Makerbase 75100 v2 does not exist
[2023-10-02T00:18:32] NetworkDir: v2 = alupcb ?
[2023-10-02T00:18:40] NetworkDir: Yep
[2023-10-02T00:18:50] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_9976@02-10-2023_00-18-50.jpg>
[2023-10-02T00:18:57] NetworkDir: But don't purchase makerbase
[2023-10-02T00:18:58] NetworkDir: crap
[2023-10-02T00:20:40] KierreKikkeli: Instead of destroying my charger i decided to destroy the default charging port xd, and yes it seems like my previous issue with soldering connectors was crap soldering irons that costs 6x more then the ali one i used without any issues xd
[2023-10-02T00:20:57] KierreKikkeli: Also multimeter says it works flawlessly
[2023-10-02T00:25:10] haku: Is makerbase and makerx the same brand?
[2023-10-02T00:25:45] NetworkDir: No
[2023-10-02T00:26:14] haku: Thank you. i always get it mixed up.
[2023-10-02T00:26:19] Mirono escooters: Makerx is better
[2023-10-02T00:27:33] haku: The makerx g300 looks good for the price. Any other vesc have similar spec to that?
[2023-10-02T00:27:57] NetworkDir: Check ubox alupcb
[2023-10-02T00:29:04] cihan: Would you recommend anything cheaper than ubox?
[2023-10-02T00:29:30] haku: Cool. I do like spintend customer service probably the best from china
[2023-10-02T00:29:58] NetworkDir: Nope i dont
[2023-10-02T00:30:12] NetworkDir: Flipsky - makerbase trash
[2023-10-02T00:30:23] NetworkDir: Flipsky little bit better but for price trash
[2023-10-02T00:31:00] cihan: Is it only because mosfet burning when BMS shuts down and because of bad current control or wrong current reporting?
[2023-10-02T00:31:48] haku: What would spintend rank in build quality compared to others? I just purchased my 1st vesc from them?
[2023-10-02T00:32:26] NetworkDir: No phase filter Burn pcb or mosfets at bms cut off shitty shunt values and wrong currents Heats to much No included on off system (key) No 12v 3A output for light horn and ..
[2023-10-02T00:32:31] NetworkDir: And shitty customer service
[2023-10-02T00:33:09] NetworkDir: i think 3shul - spintend - tronic - Trampa has good quality
[2023-10-02T00:33:33] haku: Great what about makerx?
[2023-10-02T00:33:44] NetworkDir: i dont have any idea about makerx
[2023-10-02T00:33:47] NetworkDir: but looks good
[2023-10-02T00:34:10] haku: Gotcha. Thank you
[2023-10-02T00:34:57] cihan: Do you mean a switch located on controller as on /off system or a port where you connect the key?
[2023-10-02T00:35:06] haku: I wish spintend made i higher draw than the 85/200 though. Would be great on a 72v ebike
[2023-10-02T00:35:16] NetworkDir: Yes
[2023-10-02T00:35:23] NetworkDir: not avaliable at 75100
[2023-10-02T00:35:39] NetworkDir: Need resistor mod
[2023-10-02T00:37:30] cihan: Thank you, I don't have signals, I have only light and that's all. Besides the controller should I buy ADC? And I would like to ask if I can use navee n65 dashboard with it? I think it's UART. I don't really need dashboard. I only want to use dashboard to use the button of original controller to turn on lights.
[2023-10-02T00:37:44] cihan: I don't use gear and I don't need rewding speed.
[2023-10-02T00:38:00] NetworkDir: little bit hard
[2023-10-02T00:38:26] cihan: I'll try to solve Bluetooth with esp32
[2023-10-02T00:38:31] NetworkDir: Considering the cost and time you spend, it's not worth navee n65. You need a new scooter :))
[2023-10-02T00:38:36] NetworkDir: Like g30 frame
[2023-10-02T00:40:59] cihan: Do you mean g30 frame and motor? My main purpose was to make navee a little bit faster and have higher acceleration when I discovered VESC. My first option was buying a Kugoo controller which unclocks speed but field weakening, FOC seemed charming comparing a stock controller.
[2023-10-02T00:42:15] NetworkDir: Yes. Well you can use this one https://tr.aliexpress.com/item/1005004858507542.html
[2023-10-02T00:42:28] NetworkDir: at least alupcb
[2023-10-02T00:43:21] cihan: There are also people happy with 75100 but after all you tell, it's hard to buy for me.)
[2023-10-02T00:43:37] NetworkDir: 75100 v1 shit
[2023-10-02T00:43:44] NetworkDir: V2 alupcb little bit better
[2023-10-02T00:45:20] cihan: I still cannot find any info on 60100. Izuna seemed to like it but I guess there's no one using it here yet.
[2023-10-02T00:50:02] Mirono escooters: It's very new
[2023-10-02T00:58:31] cihan: Yes, I should better prefer a model known for a while.
[2023-10-02T00:59:04] KierreKikkeli: Absolute shite xd, free roaming solderballs inside the vesc, bad solders, even wires that come with it can be faulty
[2023-10-02T00:59:58] KierreKikkeli: Also depending on the ubox there can be barely any documentation about anything
[2023-10-02T01:00:49] KierreKikkeli: Literally just found out even the powerbutton can have faulty solder
[2023-10-02T01:00:53] cihan: That's sad to know, someone was already wishing them to send it without soldering parts.
[2023-10-02T01:01:03] KierreKikkeli: Yeah
[2023-10-02T01:01:53] KierreKikkeli: To the point the guys who recommended it to me declared they wont recommend em anymore coz of quality assurance issues like that
[2023-10-02T01:03:37] KierreKikkeli: potential to be amazing but potential to also not work at all out of the box or it can literally just fry itself instantly
[2023-10-02T01:03:39] cihan: VESC isn't new as I checked, it's something mature, I don't know why there aren't cheap and quality VESC controllers, somehow it never became popular enough.
[2023-10-02T01:03:54] KierreKikkeli: vesc project
[2023-10-02T01:03:58] KierreKikkeli: the og's
[2023-10-02T01:04:01] cihan: I wouldn't take that risk
[2023-10-02T01:04:38] KierreKikkeli: ye, add the lack of barely any documentation on mine makes it even worse
[2023-10-02T01:05:23] KierreKikkeli: @Happy_Giraffe did i miss anything? xd
[2023-10-02T01:09:56] haku: What is the I in the bottom right under T fet max?
[2023-10-02T01:10:29] cihan: Current
[2023-10-02T01:10:42] haku: Gotcha thank you!
[2023-10-02T01:11:20] haku: I have a dual ubox vesc is that the current for both esc sides?
[2023-10-02T01:11:50] haku: Or battery current?
[2023-10-02T01:12:52] cihan: I have no idea. But battery current and controller current should be close. It should be for both ESC since it's pretty high for only one if you look at Imax
[2023-10-02T01:13:27] haku: my battery can only draw 90a lol
[2023-10-02T01:13:46] haku: Is there a way to track battery current?
[2023-10-02T01:13:46] cihan: It's still pretty high
[2023-10-02T01:14:12] Rogerio Figueiredo: Very nice how was the tip speed
[2023-10-02T01:14:34] cihan: I've got no experience with vesc controller but logging clampmeter does it.)
[2023-10-02T01:14:48] haku: Oh snap. Im at 45a per side. Should i lower to 40a. I dont trust my battery
[2023-10-02T01:15:19] haku: Speed is the same. It just runs smoother imo
[2023-10-02T01:15:42] haku: Thanks
[2023-10-02T01:16:07] Rogerio Figueiredo: It has to be more speed when you give more Field weakening
[2023-10-02T01:17:12] haku: Im still figuring out how vesc works. I dont want to draw more because i dont trust my battery yet lol
[2023-10-02T01:17:52] haku: How do i enable that? Im very new
[2023-10-02T01:18:36] Rogerio Figueiredo: Change the bms on that battery and should be fine
[2023-10-02T01:19:32] haku: Cool
[2023-10-02T01:20:00] Rogerio Figueiredo: At least you can control
[2023-10-02T01:20:25] haku: I do have an ant bms 300a but planning to use that on my battery build
[2023-10-02T01:20:34] Rogerio Figueiredo: I'm using stock 52v batter from my laotie es10p with vesc 500km allready
[2023-10-02T01:30:20] haku: Nice!
[2023-10-02T02:12:48] KierreKikkeli: Why the charger do dat and why is it blinking green? Battery level currently around 95%-100%
[2023-10-02T02:13:44] KierreKikkeli: <video_file>
[2023-10-02T02:14:08] KierreKikkeli: It restarts by itself after a while
[2023-10-02T02:15:38] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_9979@02-10-2023_02-15-38.jpg>
[2023-10-02T02:19:46] KierreKikkeli: "If the battery is damaged or if any other defect occurs, the LED indicator starts to flash (red/green). If the polarity is reversed, the charger will not start the charging process." Ah, i see, all tho dont understand why, according to multimeter the volts were fine on the adapter?
[2023-10-02T02:21:56] KierreKikkeli: Oh well ill just use the stock charger
[2023-10-02T02:28:12] KierreKikkeli: Vesc tool reporting 96% battery and stock charger does nothing
[2023-10-02T02:28:45] KierreKikkeli: Do i actually need the rita inbetween the charger and the battery üòëüòëüòë
[2023-10-02T06:37:12] Happy Giraffe: Bro its making sure it charges it full
[2023-10-02T06:37:57] Happy Giraffe: But the restarting is funny, mine also does it nowadays
[2023-10-02T06:39:35] Happy Giraffe: So basically when cell is soon full the charger slows down and I think the restarting is just a way to make sure nothing is left uncharged

[2023-10-02T14:15:45] Happy Giraffe: Thanks @jamessoderstrom for the vesc
[2023-10-02T14:16:07] Happy Giraffe: Will be fun fitting it in nowüòÅ
[2023-10-02T14:17:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: The only annoying thing is that it uses M2.5 screws for the mounting.
[2023-10-02T14:20:50] Happy Giraffe: I'm so ready to tap 4mm in
[2023-10-02T14:20:59] Happy Giraffe: But first I try that 2.5mm

[2023-10-02T14:46:10] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You can divide it for each esc or sum it
[2023-10-02T14:46:30] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: No, its not battery, its phase current

[2023-10-02T14:53:42] haku: Thank you so much. I was wondering where to find individual current.
[2023-10-02T15:01:15] haku: Thats a awsome heatsimk which vesc is that?
[2023-10-02T15:03:30] haku: Or a dc converter?
[2023-10-02T15:12:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Looks like DC

[2023-10-02T16:36:19] puneDir: is this cutoff proof? Btw does it have phase filters
[2023-10-02T16:38:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes. Yes.

[2023-10-02T19:14:23] Yamal: What type of battery does it have? and the engines look like they are from the mantis itself..
[2023-10-02T19:18:35] Yamal: @SibClimb , They say that the controlling shull handle the "temperature" theme very well. By the way, I currently have a Nami and I follow your Red Nami very closely. It's a shame that she shut up in Albaidaüî•üöÄüëç

[2023-10-02T19:25:16] Yamal: and the truth is that with the 33/2 winding, a lot of torque is lost,,,,,, unless you gain something from the battery discharge, if not I change to 22/3 more enjoyment for day to day
[2023-10-02T19:26:15] Yamal: On the contrary, you have less weight and it is easier to run more, my batteries today are enough to make you cry.
[2023-10-02T19:28:16] Yamal: and nothing arrived late with kelly and they are already settled, the next thing is vesc I don't think about it,! but I am worried about the temperature issue" in summer
[2023-10-02T19:28:30] Simone: 33√ó2 need a lot of A to make...the same engines with the previous configuration (kelly 7212s) did not reach over 118kmh
[2023-10-02T19:28:53] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Wut 29e.. 11p.. You have maximum of 80-90A peak discharge. 11p are 6.5-7kwt not continuous with 20s here. 130kmh need atleast 17.5kwts of power continuous. It means around 240A (if 72v) continuous from battery. Wtf?
[2023-10-02T19:29:23] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You have 30v of sag?

[2023-10-02T19:31:36] Yamal: <photos/photo_9989@02-10-2023_19-31-36.jpg>
[2023-10-02T19:32:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Pls keep us updated
[2023-10-02T19:33:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: Oh you have nami
[2023-10-02T19:34:03] Simone: and it's downhill
[2023-10-02T19:34:20] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Like, yeah
[2023-10-02T19:35:49] Yamal: <photos/photo_9990@02-10-2023_19-35-49.jpg>
[2023-10-02T19:36:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: Why not 70h?
[2023-10-02T19:39:13] Yamal: because I got these engines from a friend at a very good price and I took the opportunity to put them, but I really want 70h 22/3 phase 10
[2023-10-02T19:40:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: Change the controller, not motors
[2023-10-02T19:41:52] Yamal: My phases are very thin, they are not correct, do I have the opportunity to buy Tronic 250 ..?
[2023-10-02T19:43:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: Tronic 250 worst controller
[2023-10-02T19:44:01] Yamal: Which vesc?
[2023-10-02T19:45:33] Yamal: The kellys with 22/3 engines have torque and"top speed but I think more is needed for this scooter
[2023-10-02T19:48:08] Gabe Enzo: are those 11x3?
[2023-10-02T19:48:21] Gabe Enzo: My Kugoo has 11x3 but it looks like 11x4 tbh
[2023-10-02T19:49:47] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Briesc, c350v4 from 3shul, spintend 85200
[2023-10-02T19:49:59] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: One of them
[2023-10-02T20:04:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: Albaida was a shame yes
[2023-10-02T20:10:22] Yamal: That can happen to anyone, are you the one with the purple and yellow dt compact?
[2023-10-02T21:27:45] Face de Pin Suc√©: I was the team manager :) But yes, we have the purple dt compact hehe
[2023-10-02T21:32:47] Jan: Why purple? üòÖ
[2023-10-02T21:33:09] Oreo huzky: 3.3V for encoders means hall+ correct?
[2023-10-02T21:33:38] Oreo huzky: <photos/photo_9991@02-10-2023_21-33-38.jpg>
[2023-10-02T21:36:14] Oreo huzky: Never mind I guess it‚Äôs 5V
[2023-10-02T21:36:21] Oreo huzky: Same as for flipsky
[2023-10-02T21:42:05] Happy Giraffe: What was the issue?
[2023-10-02T21:42:24] Mirono escooters: Why not
[2023-10-02T21:43:17] Jan: Ah just wanted to hear where that inspiration came from
[2023-10-02T21:44:16] Andrius: What have you done to this nami? I want so badly a build on this frame, but also dont want to spend too much
[2023-10-02T22:08:09] Yamal: I really don‚Äôt know , 110/50/6,5 rear ////90/65/6,5 infront
[2023-10-02T22:11:30] Yamal: I don't add much to it, in that photo 150mm suspension/ 65h 33/2 engine, Kelly 7218 not much more,, I have yet to see it finished and I'm looking forward to putting in the battery, with high discharge batteries.
[2023-10-02T22:12:10] Andrius: So it has stock battery right now?
[2023-10-02T22:16:06] Yamal: Yes, it is sad!! but the snake runs! but really my battery is suffering, I'm melting itüòÇüî•
[2023-10-02T22:16:28] Andrius: Bms not cutting out?
[2023-10-02T22:17:24] haku: How much can you discharge on the stock nami battery?
[2023-10-02T22:19:27] haku: Amps you can draw?
[2023-10-02T22:21:21] Yamal: It only has BMS to charge//free download, of course I always control temperatures,, and those top speeds,, are just one straight line, after that I use it normally
[2023-10-02T22:21:49] Simone: ~ 120A
[2023-10-02T22:22:03] haku: Nice!
[2023-10-02T22:22:47] haku: Do you know what cells nami uses?
[2023-10-02T22:22:53] Simone: I don't remember if he uses LG M50
[2023-10-02T22:22:54] Andrius: M50lt
[2023-10-02T22:23:04] Yamal: My cell is this
[2023-10-02T22:23:15] Simone: Exactly
[2023-10-02T22:23:26] Yamal: <files/INR18650-29E-data-sheet (1).pdf>
[2023-10-02T22:23:52] Yamal: Nami first gerenation ‚Ä¶ some come with this cells ‚Ä¶
[2023-10-02T22:26:27] haku: Nice! 15a
[2023-10-02T22:27:50] Yamal: The good thing about Kelly is that I suppose that you can also adjust the parameters for the battery and motors that you have so that everything doesn't end up burning.
[2023-10-02T22:28:12] haku: I was considering those cells. They have it from battery hookup used. How does it handle in high draw applications?
[2023-10-02T22:28:31] Mirono escooters: There are better alternatives
[2023-10-02T22:28:33] Mirono escooters: Way better
[2023-10-02T22:29:03] Mirono escooters: Especially for high current
[2023-10-02T22:29:31] haku: Ofcourse but for a budget alternative i guess should be fine
[2023-10-02T22:30:00] haku: But i will build with moli p42 but only draw 20a per cell to be safe
[2023-10-02T22:34:12] Mirono escooters: Why be safe? Its rated to something for reason
[2023-10-02T22:34:15] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-10-02T22:35:00] haku: True dat lol
[2023-10-02T22:36:00] Yamal: What are your scooters? it would be nice to see some photos
[2023-10-02T22:36:04] Yamal: Heheh
[2023-10-02T22:36:44] haku: I have a vsett9+ and a laotie ti30 with spintend controller
[2023-10-02T22:37:14] haku: Im planning to mess around with the laotie
[2023-10-02T22:37:48] haku: So much space in the deck for a good pack
[2023-10-02T22:38:59] haku: These are my upgrades lately
[2023-10-02T22:39:00] haku: <photos/photo_9993@02-10-2023_22-39-00.jpg>
[2023-10-02T22:39:03] Yamal: how nice compactüëç
[2023-10-02T22:40:24] Yamal: I am amazed by Vesc technology, some say that in the future everything will be with Vesc
[2023-10-02T22:41:07] Yamal: but it is not simple, infinite parameters,
[2023-10-02T22:41:12] Mirono escooters: Vesc is merely software
[2023-10-02T22:41:13] haku: Me too. This is my 1st controller upgrade and im liking the tunability
[2023-10-02T22:41:20] Mirono escooters: The hardware is just compatible with it
[2023-10-02T22:43:11] haku: I wish they make bigger ones for 72v ebikes
[2023-10-02T22:43:38] haku: Like 500a phase
[2023-10-02T22:44:50] Yamal: looking forward to seeing the new Rion Apex on the streets of our cities, even if someone screws up the model and its electronics for the simple fact that it is called Tronic 250Rüî•üöÄüôèüòÇ
[2023-10-02T22:45:51] Happy Giraffe: How do you guys manage cables in a way that the sit nicely and are never pulled or damaged?
[2023-10-02T22:46:28] Mirono escooters: They do?
[2023-10-02T22:46:31] Happy Giraffe: Especially adc, throttle, bt...that stay inside vehicle body
[2023-10-02T22:46:40] Mirono escooters: Makerx g300 3shul Trampa
[2023-10-02T22:46:52] Mirono escooters: Cable wrap around it
[2023-10-02T22:47:24] Yamal: Shull controller from India no?
[2023-10-02T22:47:36] haku: Nice!
[2023-10-02T22:47:43] Happy Giraffe: Designing vesc as a component to try fitting
[2023-10-02T22:48:24] Happy Giraffe: Probably will 3D print some cable guides inside the box
[2023-10-02T22:53:27] haku: I wish i had a 3d printer it would be awsome to have the
[2023-10-02T22:53:34] haku: Adc in a case
[2023-10-02T22:54:28] Happy Giraffe: Where do you live?
[2023-10-02T22:54:40] haku: Las vegas nevada
[2023-10-02T22:55:09] Happy Giraffe: There should be plenty people in the states that do these kind of things
[2023-10-02T22:55:35] Happy Giraffe: Or do it from strong cardboardüòÅ
[2023-10-02T22:55:54] haku: Yea. I want to get bambu p1p but just waiting for black friday
[2023-10-02T22:56:28] Happy Giraffe: Good choise if the space is enough for you
[2023-10-02T22:57:07] Happy Giraffe: You can ofcourse glue/bolt parts together but that aint as nice
[2023-10-02T22:57:20] haku: It will be my 1st printer. Ill want to print mounts for lights and cases
[2023-10-02T23:00:08] Happy Giraffe: Cheaper alternative is the new creality ender3 SE that has automatic z height offset for crazy value
[2023-10-02T23:00:24] Happy Giraffe: But for speed bambulab definitely is 2x faster
[2023-10-02T23:01:22] haku: Nice. It doesnt have to be fast i juat want reliable clean prints. Hopefully it will be on sale on black friday
[2023-10-02T23:06:17] Happy Giraffe: https://www.creality.com/products/creality-ender-3-v3-se
[2023-10-02T23:07:12] Happy Giraffe: Prints take surprisingly long if you do bigger projectsüòÅ Also for printer filament you want a dry/heater box as some filaments dont like the humid air.
[2023-10-02T23:08:21] haku: Nice that would be great for making 20s battery holder/insulation.
[2023-10-02T23:09:05] haku: Like compact cell holders
[2023-10-02T23:11:31] Happy Giraffe: Max I could fit on 300x300 millimeter is 13s cell holders so even then have to glue two for 20S
[2023-10-02T23:12:44] haku: I see. Thats still huge. If i see a sale on that i will definately consider it
[2023-10-02T23:18:58] Happy Giraffe: Chances you have to print a battery holder is low. And even then you could go and ask some company to print it instead on one go. Saving you from glueing and 1500‚Ç¨ extra for bigger printerüòÇ
[2023-10-02T23:21:34] haku: Thats true.
[2023-10-02T23:29:07] haku: This is the most compact holders that i got. This should do for now.
[2023-10-02T23:29:42] Konstantin: I use this in my etwow ;) Space saver xD
[2023-10-02T23:30:48] Konstantin: Glued by b7000 (or something like this, fes dots) , pure nickel strip...all perfect..
[2023-10-02T23:30:48] haku: Nice! Did you put any adhesive on the cells to stick?
[2023-10-02T23:31:41] haku: Is it the e6000 rubber crafting glue?
[2023-10-02T23:33:07] Konstantin: This one build for my friend. Glued by e8000, but hhis all like b7000, for screens etc
[2023-10-02T23:33:27] Konstantin: Like this, y
[2023-10-02T23:34:02] haku: Thanks
[2023-10-02T23:51:14] Gabe Enzo: are holders even necessary tho?
[2023-10-02T23:51:43] Mirono escooters: If you glue you have to isolate the cells, a lot
[2023-10-02T23:51:54] Mirono escooters: Holders make it very easy. Time saving, safer But a tad bulkier.
[2023-10-02T23:51:59] Gabe Enzo: they will never touch.
[2023-10-02T23:52:05] Gabe Enzo: Yes sadly
[2023-10-02T23:52:34] Gabe Enzo: w dym by isolate the cells?
[2023-10-02T23:52:54] Gabe Enzo: they're all isolated
[2023-10-02T23:53:03] haku: I guess it will be easier to fix if some cells go bad
[2023-10-02T23:53:27] Gabe Enzo: what I've learned so far Is always prepare for the worst
[2023-10-02T23:55:35] Mirono escooters: More ..
[2023-10-03T00:14:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: Why not ? x)
[2023-10-03T00:15:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, go for a C700 :)
[2023-10-03T00:16:50] Jan: Its for sure something else ^^
[2023-10-03T00:17:09] Pablo Fernandez: i will have to buy those sexy cable sleeves on white from rage mechanics they look so cool
[2023-10-03T00:17:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: Well, I wanted something new, that nobody does, that you can recognize instantly on the circuit ==> Purple + Yellow
[2023-10-03T00:18:00] Face de Pin Suc√©: Now we see more and more escooter with purple hehe
[2023-10-03T00:18:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: They are üòä
[2023-10-03T00:19:05] Pablo Fernandez: still my dream paintjob is the guy that has the whole nami in white (i would paint mine white if it wasnt due to police)
[2023-10-03T00:19:22] Pablo Fernandez: this guy
[2023-10-03T00:32:38] Yamal: <photos/photo_9998@03-10-2023_00-32-38.jpg>
[2023-10-03T00:32:38] Yamal: <photos/photo_9999@03-10-2023_00-32-38.jpg>
[2023-10-03T00:35:45] Yamal: but I think the nami rs has the house electronics
[2023-10-03T00:36:40] Pablo Fernandez: yeah is amazing i just dont like the sides
[2023-10-03T00:36:52] Pablo Fernandez: for me this one is just amazing
[2023-10-03T00:40:01] Yamal: <photos/photo_10000@03-10-2023_00-40-01.jpg>
[2023-10-03T00:40:01] Yamal: <photos/photo_10001@03-10-2023_00-40-01.jpg>
[2023-10-03T00:40:14] Yamal: Better üòÅüî•
[2023-10-03T00:42:24] Yamal: It's curious but do you know of any other scooter that come with Vesc electronics from home?
[2023-10-03T00:44:16] Simone: If you put 10k in my hand I'll send it to your house with vesc üòÇ
[2023-10-03T00:49:01] Pablo Fernandez: but unusable for city riding haha
[2023-10-03T00:49:56] Oreo huzky: Both of the cl350 won‚Äôt detect hall
[2023-10-03T00:50:32] Oreo huzky: Do I need to wire positive of hall to 5V for throttle or 3.3V?
[2023-10-03T00:54:52] haku: dang! You guys are ballin. Buying a 4k scooter just to gut it and change everything.
[2023-10-03T01:30:04] Santiago: That's the fun part of Escooters lol
[2023-10-03T01:30:44] Santiago: Squeeze the most out of it
[2023-10-03T01:31:10] haku: üëç
[2023-10-03T01:31:37] haku: Where are you guys from?
[2023-10-03T01:36:32] haku: It would be cool to see these super scooters in person.
[2023-10-03T01:48:40] Rogerio Figueiredo: What is that?
[2023-10-03T01:58:23] Oreo huzky: Dc-Dc
[2023-10-03T03:57:41] haku: What is this about?
[2023-10-03T04:21:08] Oreo huzky: Gyro do not need only if you euc rider or these strange one wheel skateboards
[2023-10-03T04:34:19] haku: I see! Thank you
[2023-10-03T06:41:48] Happy Giraffe: Later when you have design ready you could even ask a special company to print it with high temp materials like PEEK etc. It will cost 100$ maybe but will be tank-like material
[2023-10-03T06:54:18] haku: Nice! That would be cool. I think ABS or ASA should be enough for batteries. It shouldnt go over 80c. Maybe for a controller external box peek is good.
[2023-10-03T06:55:16] haku: I really want to do it myself also learn a thing about 3d printing
[2023-10-03T07:35:58] Yamal: But this controller is more for e-bike..?
[2023-10-03T08:09:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes
[2023-10-03T08:28:54] Dimos: <photos/photo_10003@03-10-2023_08-28-54.jpg>
[2023-10-03T08:28:55] Dimos: <photos/photo_10004@03-10-2023_08-28-55.jpg>
[2023-10-03T08:29:16] Dimos: new tronic looks goood 32s 2000phase
[2023-10-03T08:29:58] Dimos: i will get it for my eucüòõ
[2023-10-03T08:46:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: It will be too big haha
[2023-10-03T08:58:43] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Or flying rc vehicles
[2023-10-03T09:23:15] Yamal: By the way, does anyone in this group know if electric scooters can be used in Holland anymore? or not yet
[2023-10-03T09:29:00] KierreKikkeli: Anyone know the proper pole amount for vsett 10+ motor? I know it should be less than 30 but 30 seems to give somewhat proper speed results
[2023-10-03T09:32:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: 30
[2023-10-03T09:37:11] Mirono escooters: Why should be less then 30 if 30 works :D
[2023-10-03T09:38:30] KierreKikkeli: I remember it having less poles then the xiaomi motors but thicker coz meant for awd, or to throw happy under the truck thats what he told me xd
[2023-10-03T09:38:38] KierreKikkeli: But ye
[2023-10-03T09:38:56] Mirono escooters: Poles and pole pairs confusion ü§∑
[2023-10-03T09:39:11] Mirono escooters: But no, its 30
[2023-10-03T09:41:10] KierreKikkeli: Ah then its prob on me xd
[2023-10-03T09:41:50] KierreKikkeli: Need to check out what the difference is
[2023-10-03T09:42:45] Mirono escooters: Bigger stator, magnets?
[2023-10-03T09:42:51] Mirono escooters: Maybe you confuse with H? Magnet size?
[2023-10-03T09:46:41] KierreKikkeli: I meant the difference in what poles and pole pairs means
[2023-10-03T09:47:27] KierreKikkeli: ah that wasent too hard xd
[2023-10-03T09:48:20] KierreKikkeli: assuming it has 14 pole pairs + lets say 2 North sided magnets while the other motor has 2 South sides it would make sense i guess
[2023-10-03T10:04:14] Happy Giraffe: Pole means magnet, pole pair means two magnetsüòÇ
[2023-10-03T10:04:30] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-10-03T10:04:42] KierreKikkeli: akhtually it means a pair of north and south poles ü§ì
[2023-10-03T10:04:49] KierreKikkeli: -g√∂√∂gle
[2023-10-03T10:06:09] KierreKikkeli: or then the vsett just has 28 poles ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø gps test will tell
[2023-10-03T10:06:31] KierreKikkeli: first need to add profiles tho in case of angery popo
[2023-10-03T10:06:44] Happy Giraffe: Yup
[2023-10-03T10:07:11] Happy Giraffe: It doesnt matter, use rather correct magnet count and mod tire size
[2023-10-03T10:07:49] Happy Giraffe: Don't put the tinfoil hat on, if motor has 30 it is 30 even if you dont like it
[2023-10-03T10:09:40] KierreKikkeli: no im just wondering where the 14 pairs come from and what the other 2 magnets are if they even exist i dont care if it has 31.5 magnets or what as long as the speedometer shows correct numbers xd
[2023-10-03T10:12:36] KierreKikkeli: 30 seems more than likely
[2023-10-03T10:13:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Unsure where you get 28 ,most of the engine's we use are 30 And i can tell you for sure it's 30 on vsett also
[2023-10-03T10:14:36] KierreKikkeli: someone told me false information when initially setting up the vesc it seems
[2023-10-03T10:16:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: It can happen
[2023-10-03T10:18:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I could search for a pics,coz i have or just search in vsett group ,but anyway if Engine Would have such a difference i would remember for sure , since i have some of does
[2023-10-03T10:19:23] KierreKikkeli: yeah i found a reddit thread where someone's kid messed up his settings and was told its 90% likely to be 30
[2023-10-03T10:21:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Honestly i dont like Reddit 90% bullshit 8% false info Maybe the rest is true Any topic ü§£
[2023-10-03T10:22:36] KierreKikkeli: i believe in the angry incels that have a need to over correct everything and everyone on there, other then that yes agreed XD
[2023-10-03T10:23:02] KierreKikkeli: atleast its better than 4chan or facebook
[2023-10-03T10:25:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Reminds me of post in a local group efficiency is above the sky and clearly you can see PS made mods on pics also pretty badly
[2023-10-03T10:25:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I even hate to read my own community on face üòÖ
[2023-10-03T10:27:29] KierreKikkeli: same and same, in here we even have a native bootleg 4chan forum which is somehow even worse then 3chan or whatever its called
[2023-10-03T10:40:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I am probably old to know what is 3 and 4 chan I just know onichanüòÅü§£
[2023-10-03T10:40:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Not even sure how its correct üòÖ
[2023-10-03T10:40:51] KierreKikkeli: Xddd
[2023-10-03T10:41:03] KierreKikkeli: Prequels to reddit at the dawn of internet
[2023-10-03T10:43:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: üòÅ dawn of internet ü§î probably was reading more of battlechat on irc
[2023-10-03T10:44:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But me old , like Started to lan on quake 1
[2023-10-03T10:45:25] KierreKikkeli: i mean 4chan came out 2003
[2023-10-03T10:46:03] KierreKikkeli: practically a beta reddit with 0 censorship
[2023-10-03T10:46:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Quake 1 was 96
[2023-10-03T10:46:25] KierreKikkeli: XDD damn
[2023-10-03T10:46:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I feel more old and old
[2023-10-03T10:46:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Stop itüòÅüòÖ
[2023-10-03T10:46:46] KierreKikkeli: before i was even born ü§î
[2023-10-03T10:47:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yeah ,i was killing ppl online Before you bornüôà sounds wierd a lot
[2023-10-03T10:48:06] KierreKikkeli: indeed xd, but then again my old main pc was from 95 with a 1gb hard drive XDDDDDDD
[2023-10-03T10:48:24] KierreKikkeli: thing barely ran skype at 2010 without crashing
[2023-10-03T10:49:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I had few rare pc back in the day from the usa ,was fun everybody had pc with old ass big ports for mouse while i had ps2 type already ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-10-03T10:50:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Anyway we should stop the off , but for last ,if you have CSGO in steam now you get 2 for free ü§£
[2023-10-03T10:51:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: ... Anybody uses mx lemming daily?
[2023-10-03T10:51:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I made some testing for a while
[2023-10-03T10:52:01] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: On an old blade Engine from Paolo
[2023-10-03T10:54:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Engine has a long story and had life before i saw it ,but still looks lovely inside and works like new Was bought by Happy from Paulo when new ,then got to Miro , Miro sold it to a mate of mine ,who gave it to me and i gave it to a friend ü§£
[2023-10-03T10:55:05] KierreKikkeli: XDDDDDDD
[2023-10-03T11:02:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: It's in a g30, while there are new metal brackets to hold it ,not inside washer ,but axle has a position to sit in , while on brake side has interesting shape, so it holds the brake also
[2023-10-03T11:45:53] Happy Giraffe: Didn't you prefer ortega for scoot motor?
[2023-10-03T11:47:37] Happy Giraffe: For me it seemed impossible atleast with geared motor to use ortega and high currents. Might be because of 20mm stator or the original ubox single
[2023-10-03T11:47:53] Mirono escooters: Smol
[2023-10-03T11:47:54] Mirono escooters: 20mm xd
[2023-10-03T11:49:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What is your main idea about it , i would say more torque, power And also makes lot more heat than ortega
[2023-10-03T11:57:34] SirGeoff: <photos/photo_10006@03-10-2023_11-57-34.jpg>
[2023-10-03T12:08:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: All yxpower use to do that on the end of charging ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-10-03T12:08:33] Mirono escooters: You worry so much
[2023-10-03T12:09:23] KierreKikkeli: i mean it didnt do it with rita so was wondering did i fck up my diy adapter xd
[2023-10-03T12:09:35] Mirono escooters: Maybe its balancing
[2023-10-03T12:10:10] KierreKikkeli: and manual said its a error indicator so who knows
[2023-10-03T12:10:17] Mirono escooters: Kaput
[2023-10-03T12:10:19] Mirono escooters: All kaput
[2023-10-03T12:12:07] KierreKikkeli: <animation>
[2023-10-03T12:13:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: It's starting to if you have like daly what balances in the end ,if big balance difference it even turns back red and fan starts again
[2023-10-03T12:13:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: There lvl of english is Hi dear
[2023-10-03T12:14:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Daly is similar,if you check how to wire clearly tells there is huge language barrier üòÖ
[2023-10-03T12:15:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I had like 3-4 chargers like that and all did this
[2023-10-03T12:22:10] KierreKikkeli: i was actually suprised by the clarity of the english in the manual
[2023-10-03T12:22:51] KierreKikkeli: but then again, prob translated directly from chinese to english and sent to be proof read xd
[2023-10-03T13:35:09] Happy Giraffe: Maybe offset for magnetic field is closer and less of a degree away
[2023-10-03T13:35:36] Happy Giraffe: Like inversed Field weakening
[2023-10-03T13:36:23] Happy Giraffe: Yup
[2023-10-03T13:36:41] Happy Giraffe: But for outrunners I mean
[2023-10-03T13:36:55] Gabe Enzo: HAHA
[2023-10-03T13:37:15] Happy Giraffe: Would be fun to do a custom offset curve to be very little ¬∞ at start and then like 2-3¬∞ at the end to keep topend torqueüòÅ
[2023-10-03T13:41:37] Happy Giraffe: For IPM motors the difference was insane I heard. Lightning rods motor on vesc is bonkers
[2023-10-03T13:42:09] Happy Giraffe: Vesc easily beats other FOC esc like ASI even when asi also has some nice features
[2023-10-03T13:42:36] Happy Giraffe: This also keeps motor ice cool
[2023-10-03T13:48:12] Gabe Enzo: whatever is made by the people Is always bette.
[2023-10-03T13:48:39] Gabe Enzo: Yes!!
[2023-10-03T13:59:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: You can't imagine how much it is
[2023-10-03T13:59:28] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes heard that too
[2023-10-03T13:59:32] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-10-03T13:59:49] Face de Pin Suc√©: But we still are worst at 0 speed with hub motors
[2023-10-03T13:59:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: Dunno why
[2023-10-03T14:00:07] Happy Giraffe: He already has so much power at 150A phase that he doesnt even want more
[2023-10-03T14:00:16] Happy Giraffe: Yes, this is weird
[2023-10-03T14:00:40] Happy Giraffe: I also want the start grunt now that there will be beefy steel torque armsüòÅ
[2023-10-03T14:01:08] Happy Giraffe: Final ones 10mm acid proof plates, good for maxing out the motorüåö
[2023-10-03T14:01:22] Happy Giraffe: Dont you have less startup torque?
[2023-10-03T14:02:25] Happy Giraffe: For me the push kicks in after 10kmh. Even if sensorless switch is earlier its still the same outcome...but will check again on this new vesc
[2023-10-03T14:02:39] Happy Giraffe: Ye
[2023-10-03T14:03:29] Happy Giraffe: 0.05sec
[2023-10-03T14:04:09] Happy Giraffe: I will start with this new vesc now and seeüòÅ old one was bit wanky when producing vibrations and loosing track of rotor
[2023-10-03T14:04:47] Happy Giraffe: On the early days I got to try the gmac at 120A phase and it was insane, tho later it didnt work after 90A+ idk why...
[2023-10-03T14:05:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, but anyway, it is not as torquey at 0 speed as a kelly 7230 for example
[2023-10-03T14:05:24] Face de Pin Suc√©: And we are pushing more amps üòÇ
[2023-10-03T14:05:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: But for mid drive IPM motors, we kill everyone, it's only a matter for hub
[2023-10-03T14:06:00] Face de Pin Suc√©: We measured at amp clamp
[2023-10-03T14:06:21] Happy Giraffe: From 0 it should smack head like a 120mm smoothbore tank cannon. Mostly we never use max speed on traffic but start torque is excitingüòÅ
[2023-10-03T14:07:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, from app it‚Äôs possible
[2023-10-03T14:07:11] Happy Giraffe: IPM mid drive is the dream for the offroad bike...
[2023-10-03T14:07:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: But very very slow current reading
[2023-10-03T14:08:23] Happy Giraffe: But how can we increase it with halls enabled and motor calibrated, 0.05s ramp-up etc?ü§î
[2023-10-03T14:10:15] Happy Giraffe: Atm designing a nice case for itüòÅ
[2023-10-03T14:41:13] Mihail: How much phase current do I need to get rear tire spin? I can't get it to spin with 140phase/60batt. I have not touched the ramp time, would it make a difference?
[2023-10-03T14:42:27] Finn: More moore mooooore
[2023-10-03T14:42:53] Mihail: Im scared to go over 160 on single mosfet
[2023-10-03T14:43:11] Mihail: 6fet*
[2023-10-03T14:44:35] Mihail: Guess I wont be spinning the rear anytime soon. The front spins at 90 even with shifting my weight on it, rear refuses to spin. I may try 160A and slippery surface in the future
[2023-10-03T14:47:57] Mirono escooters: Spinning rear isn't ez
[2023-10-03T14:48:33] Face de Pin Suc√©: I spin the rear on wet with my speedway leger, very scary, but impossible on dry
[2023-10-03T15:07:20] Konstantin: Use clamp for oscilloscope, they have good resolution
[2023-10-03T15:27:01] cihan: I have a question about JK BMS. There's a table showing different model specs on JK website and aliexpress seller page. JK claims all models have rs485 and CANBUS. Seller page claims some models have rs485 and some higher balance current models have RS 485 and heat pad connection. Heat pad could be useful for me on long term. Will I ever need CANBUS on a BMS? Or do higher current models still support CANBUS too?
[2023-10-03T15:27:33] cihan: <photos/photo_10007@03-10-2023_15-27-33.jpg>
[2023-10-03T15:27:33] cihan: This is from JK website.
[2023-10-03T15:28:16] cihan: This is from seller
[2023-10-03T15:29:32] cihan: On long term I can only need rs485 since my victron inverter uses rs485.

[2023-10-03T15:58:50] puneDir: nice horn
[2023-10-03T15:59:30] KierreKikkeli: thanks, finally found one locally after 2 years and just had to buy one XD
[2023-10-03T16:00:08] KierreKikkeli: best 5 bucks ive spent ever
[2023-10-03T16:00:12] puneDir: is rear suspension stable?
[2023-10-03T16:00:25] puneDir: you should see my 50 cent shit solution
[2023-10-03T16:01:33] KierreKikkeli: it is stable, even tho it looks a bit wobbly, the tyre isnt seated properly and doesnt bother the drivability so i kinda dont care, also the brake disc seems to be bent XD
[2023-10-03T16:01:59] KierreKikkeli: but i have a shimano front brake that can lift the whole rear up from 10kmh speed XD
[2023-10-03T16:03:07] puneDir: <photos/photo_10009@03-10-2023_16-03-07.jpg>

[2023-10-03T16:03:07] puneDir: 3 Bolts with connection would be a alternativ of this
[2023-10-03T16:04:14] KierreKikkeli: XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
[2023-10-03T16:04:38] KierreKikkeli: i think ive seen this one before when i bought the vsett like last year xd
[2023-10-03T16:04:50] puneDir: yeah its old :D
[2023-10-03T16:05:15] KierreKikkeli: love that we have the same rear brake
[2023-10-03T16:05:26] puneDir: i dont have it anymore
[2023-10-03T16:24:08] KierreKikkeli: i mean that we both just had a wire hanging
[2023-10-03T17:04:33] sombre_enfant: Do this mean my bms cutted power, i lost a flipsky
[2023-10-03T17:04:59] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-10-03T17:05:22] Mirono escooters: Configure The flipsky with underv cutoff or some cell bad?
[2023-10-03T17:29:00] sombre_enfant: Config was good but i was maybe pushing a lil too hard
[2023-10-03T17:38:22] Gabe Enzo: Why do you think Non vescs don't have that problem? This is the only drawback with induction motors.
[2023-10-03T17:38:35] Gabe Enzo: This is the trade we pay for brushless.
[2023-10-03T17:39:13] Gabe Enzo: Not Hub bro, brushless in general.
[2023-10-03T17:43:43] Mirono escooters: Halls exist, halls work fine
[2023-10-03T17:43:45] Happy Giraffe: For IPM motors I heard its a very good start torque
[2023-10-03T17:43:51] Mirono escooters: Encoder üëç
[2023-10-03T17:43:53] Happy Giraffe: Those also brushless
[2023-10-03T17:44:15] Mirono escooters: Some Escs have very good no hall 0 start
[2023-10-03T17:44:23] Mirono escooters: Vesc not so, well not without alot of tuninf
[2023-10-03T17:45:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes because square wave
[2023-10-03T17:45:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Foc I‚Äôve my serious doubt
[2023-10-03T17:45:31] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2023-10-03T17:45:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: Also vesc has suce start with square wave
[2023-10-03T17:46:15] Gabe Enzo: Halls exist. but they will never compare to brushed speed control.
[2023-10-03T17:46:48] Gabe Enzo: Brushed crawlers always win competition's, even if the rivals use the finest BLDC motors with the best hall sensors available
[2023-10-03T17:46:57] Gabe Enzo: It just doesn't compare.
[2023-10-03T17:46:57] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, then a mod to start 0-5kmh with square?ü§î
[2023-10-03T17:47:00] Mirono escooters: Tf
[2023-10-03T17:47:10] Gabe Enzo: Yup
[2023-10-03T17:47:21] Mirono escooters: Na, pass. Halls work fine on brushless
[2023-10-03T17:47:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: Just use hall sensor lolüòÇ
[2023-10-03T17:47:25] Mirono escooters: Idk what source u come from
[2023-10-03T17:47:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: They made it for something
[2023-10-03T17:47:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: Why you don‚Äôt want use it?
[2023-10-03T17:47:38] Gabe Enzo: Source comes from RC competition days.
[2023-10-03T17:47:48] Gabe Enzo: they do
[2023-10-03T17:47:51] Gabe Enzo: never said they didn't
[2023-10-03T17:47:52] Mirono escooters: So many factors and scaling Uncomparable...
[2023-10-03T17:47:54] Happy Giraffe: I am but they wont do any better lol
[2023-10-03T17:48:18] Gabe Enzo: brushed motors can make a crawler 0.01kmh fast
[2023-10-03T17:48:23] Gabe Enzo: 60turn
[2023-10-03T17:48:28] Gabe Enzo: or 80 turns on stator
[2023-10-03T17:48:38] Gabe Enzo: so slow U can't see it move
[2023-10-03T17:48:39] Gabe Enzo: but it is
[2023-10-03T17:48:40] Gabe Enzo: hahahahaha
[2023-10-03T17:49:05] Gabe Enzo: so easy to climb up steep rocks.
[2023-10-03T17:49:22] Gabe Enzo: 80¬∞ |_
[2023-10-03T17:49:57] Gabe Enzo: I get it I do lol
[2023-10-03T17:50:06] Gabe Enzo: all depends on application üëç
[2023-10-03T17:50:19] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-10-03T18:04:56] Gabe Enzo: What we also did was overvolt 3650 (size) brushed motors in competition. They would last a few races, overvolted brushed is almost as fast as brushless. But need a good heatsink and fans. After the race you throw away the motor. And it would be hilarious when brushed touring cars wins against brushless üòÇ
[2023-10-03T18:05:05] Gabe Enzo: 1/10 scale sport cars.
[2023-10-03T18:05:30] Mirono escooters: Since when brushed cant hit brushless speeds
[2023-10-03T18:05:31] Gabe Enzo: superior control but Motor dead after race
[2023-10-03T18:05:41] Gabe Enzo: Usually not possible with remote control.
[2023-10-03T18:05:54] Gabe Enzo: Frame melts

[2023-10-03T18:06:40] Mirono escooters: Great
[2023-10-03T18:30:03] Happy Giraffe: I played with many settings myself, thinking it was due to motor and vesc combo that now is changed
[2023-10-03T18:43:26] Face de Pin Suc√©: No, I speak between a Kelly and a VESC on same motor of course
[2023-10-03T18:43:59] Happy Giraffe: We should do dyno runs ortega vs mxlemming
[2023-10-03T18:44:00] Mirono escooters: Accurate comparison
[2023-10-03T18:44:04] Mirono escooters: Not rc car vs scoot xD

[2023-10-03T18:44:26] Happy Giraffe: When I get better battery I will put bike also on dyno
[2023-10-03T18:44:29] puneDir: one of them shakes my motor so much at start
[2023-10-03T18:44:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: But I never managed to make mxlemming work on high currents
[2023-10-03T18:44:47] Happy Giraffe: 300-400A phase?
[2023-10-03T18:44:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: Of course, below 200A phase, everything always work well
[2023-10-03T18:44:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes
[2023-10-03T18:45:24] Happy Giraffe: Interesting, with my motor 250A+ phase is a no-go zoneüòÇ
[2023-10-03T18:54:51] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You tried inductance tuning, observer offset, different pwms?
[2023-10-03T18:55:15] Face de Pin Suc√©: Not so much with mxlemming, didn't take enough time on it
[2023-10-03T18:55:47] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Also different observer gain in uS
[2023-10-03T20:07:53] Happy Giraffe: What is the gain precisely?
[2023-10-03T20:26:32] haku: Hey guys how should i set my battery current max regen? I have a 90a battery and a dual vesc.
[2023-10-03T20:27:25] haku: I do not know the cells in the battery too.

[2023-10-03T22:01:37] haku: 45a. Its a 90a battery and im using dual ubox.
[2023-10-03T22:02:34] haku: <photos/photo_10024@03-10-2023_22-02-34.jpg>
[2023-10-03T22:02:45] haku: Is it that one?
[2023-10-03T22:02:50] Happy Giraffe: Its a huge battery?
[2023-10-03T22:03:26] haku: Its 60v38ah.
[2023-10-03T22:03:29] NetworkDir: Set -10A at batt current regen
[2023-10-03T22:03:31] Happy Giraffe: Current regen should be what charge your cells and bms can take
[2023-10-03T22:03:36] NetworkDir: Or -5
[2023-10-03T22:03:42] NetworkDir: Safer
[2023-10-03T22:03:52] Happy Giraffe: Which cells and bms?
[2023-10-03T22:04:02] haku: Gotcha thanks. I do know the cells and bms tbh.
[2023-10-03T22:04:17] haku: Yes laotie
[2023-10-03T22:04:24] haku: Its scary
[2023-10-03T22:04:38] Happy Giraffe: -12A wouldnt do moreüòÅ
[2023-10-03T22:04:56] haku: Ok. Thank you guys! Appreciate it
[2023-10-03T22:05:24] Happy Giraffe: You also need to know the bms charge current
[2023-10-03T22:05:42] Happy Giraffe: If its above 12A then all good
[2023-10-03T22:05:46] haku: Where can i find that in vesc?
[2023-10-03T22:06:10] haku: I only charge it 4a max
[2023-10-03T22:06:39] Happy Giraffe: No, the bms of the battery
[2023-10-03T22:07:13] Happy Giraffe: BMS and cells must support the regen current or other of them will blow
[2023-10-03T22:07:35] haku: I only charge 4a. I do not know what is bms limit tbh
[2023-10-03T22:08:02] Happy Giraffe: Then I would be cautious and search for info. Put -5A for start
[2023-10-03T22:08:29] Happy Giraffe: I dont think Laotie has progressive regen function also so might not handle that much
[2023-10-03T22:08:30] haku: Thanks bud!
[2023-10-03T22:09:11] Happy Giraffe: Maybe @jamessoderstrom has insight of BMS Laotie uses
[2023-10-03T22:09:15] haku: Yes. It doesnt have it. I will change to 72v p42 soon though so i know exactly how much i can push
[2023-10-03T22:09:26] NetworkDir: Shitty black pcb I dont see any burns also mosfets fine
[2023-10-03T22:09:34] Happy Giraffe: Thats a huge upgradeüòÅ
[2023-10-03T22:10:43] haku: Yes. I saved alot because i just got laotie for $700 new so i have room for upgrades
[2023-10-03T22:11:49] haku: Hopefully the stock motor can handle it. I will change phase cables to bigger guages and add a temp sensor
[2023-10-03T22:14:15] haku: Cant believe i didnt blow up running regen at -65. Lol
[2023-10-03T22:14:18] cihan: Is ubox without any problems with BMS cutoff? I still cannot make up my mind. Ubox costs 2 times. :(
[2023-10-03T22:14:56] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes it is. At least I'm not aware of any cases and @LizardDoggo "tried" it.
[2023-10-03T22:15:12] NetworkDir: Yes
[2023-10-03T22:15:31] NetworkDir: Just dont buy makerbase and flipsky

[2023-10-03T22:17:01] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No, did you even mount them correctly? üòÇ
[2023-10-03T22:17:14] NetworkDir: Hahaha nice joke

[2023-10-03T22:21:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Or what is the issue?
[2023-10-03T22:21:10] NetworkDir: At 160A battery current my voltage drop max 3-4V
[2023-10-03T22:21:10] Finn: ?
[2023-10-03T22:21:18] NetworkDir: Yes

[2023-10-03T22:23:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: @NetworkDir Anyway, you are doing something very wrong if you get temperatures like this with only 4kW total.
[2023-10-03T22:23:34] Konstantin: Current very close to how it....
[2023-10-03T22:23:40] NetworkDir: Idk might more than 4kW
[2023-10-03T22:23:45] NetworkDir: But 100% not 15kW
[2023-10-03T22:23:49] NetworkDir: Values 1/2
[2023-10-03T22:24:26] Finn: I dont get it why you flashed wrong fw?
[2023-10-03T22:25:17] puneDir: cuz i said him to flash correct firm
[2023-10-03T22:25:24] puneDir: he always does opposite
[2023-10-03T22:25:32] Finn: smart
[2023-10-03T22:26:40] NetworkDir: Actually, when I got it, 75,200 installation methods were version 5.02 I installed normal 6.2 75100V2, I realized that my speed is much lower according to the settings I made, then I tested all the different versions and the result was the same. I just used 70-80 amps instead of 30-40 amps
[2023-10-03T22:27:17] Finn: Youre doing something very wrong
[2023-10-03T22:27:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Did you check what shunt values you got?
[2023-10-03T22:27:28] NetworkDir: Please dont say bullshits
[2023-10-03T22:27:44] NetworkDir: Now i opened vesc

[2023-10-03T22:32:51] NetworkDir: Shunt res must 0.50 at here ?
[2023-10-03T22:32:56] NetworkDir: <sticker>
[2023-10-03T22:33:01] Finn: i dont think so
[2023-10-03T22:33:04] Finn: is it the original fw?
[2023-10-03T22:33:13] NetworkDir: Yes its orginal 75100 config file
[2023-10-03T22:33:17] NetworkDir: 0.0005
[2023-10-03T22:33:22] Finn: idk if they already defined the 3 stacked shunts or if you need to divide 50/3
[2023-10-03T22:34:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: 0.5 is 500mR üòÇ
[2023-10-03T22:34:03] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_10030@03-10-2023_22-34-03.jpg>
[2023-10-03T22:34:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs correct
[2023-10-03T22:34:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: The value they set
[2023-10-03T22:35:15] NetworkDir: Okay, the shunt value is correct. So what is wrong that causes the currents to be low?
[2023-10-03T22:38:11] Finn: i had the same and when i flashed 6.02 my esc burned -_-
[2023-10-03T22:39:22] NetworkDir: My esc fine with any versions but just current low at real
[2023-10-03T22:39:35] NetworkDir: After setting 100A batt current and 260A phase
[2023-10-03T22:39:36] NetworkDir: Die
[2023-10-03T22:39:39] NetworkDir: <sticker>
[2023-10-03T22:39:46] Finn: thats obv
[2023-10-03T22:39:49] NetworkDir: I checked again mosfets fucked up
[2023-10-03T22:39:56] NetworkDir: Anything fine
[2023-10-03T22:40:00] Finn: you used stock mosfets?
[2023-10-03T22:40:07] NetworkDir: Yes stock mosfets
[2023-10-03T22:42:33] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_10031@03-10-2023_22-42-33.jpg>
[2023-10-03T22:43:05] NetworkDir: MDP10N027
[2023-10-03T22:43:20] NetworkDir: 100V 120A 2.8mOhm
[2023-10-03T22:44:15] Finn: Peak 480 hm..
[2023-10-03T22:44:23] Finn: i would swap them as they get very hot
[2023-10-03T22:44:35] Finn: thats the first thing i would do when getting a box 75100
[2023-10-03T22:46:09] Finn: https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/_HUASHUO-_C2903573.html i had those in my 75100 and the temps didnt exceed above 40C
[2023-10-03T22:46:36] Finn: High current but prob overkill and too expensive for the usecase
[2023-10-03T22:48:28] Finn: cant be that one shunt is dead or something
[2023-10-03T22:48:37] Finn: he would notice that when driving
[2023-10-03T22:49:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: Less is the shunt resistance, less will be the reading resolution
[2023-10-03T22:50:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: New version has 3 shunts x 0.5
[2023-10-03T22:50:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: Specially if you don‚Äôt have phase/current filters
[2023-10-03T22:51:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: So if the phase current is wrong, battery will be wrong as well
[2023-10-03T22:53:21] NetworkDir: Tomorrow i will check shunts beacuse now pcb shorted and might multimeter show wrong value
[2023-10-03T22:53:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: You can‚Äôt check with multimeter Xd
[2023-10-03T22:53:50] NetworkDir: Lol
[2023-10-03T22:54:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: You need power supply (good one) and multimeter in mV
[2023-10-03T22:54:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: But need be very very accurate
[2023-10-03T22:55:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs why big controllers uses hall sensor
[2023-10-03T22:59:37] NetworkDir: Lmfaooo I check battery outputs
[2023-10-03T22:59:49] NetworkDir: Just my fuse exploded
[2023-10-03T23:00:16] NetworkDir: Just one batt output fine another one 0V
[2023-10-03T23:02:14] puneDir: what
[2023-10-03T23:02:35] NetworkDir: 35-35A fuses
[2023-10-03T23:02:45] NetworkDir: and at 50A its exploded
[2023-10-03T23:02:46] NetworkDir: Lol
[2023-10-03T23:02:52] NetworkDir: My vesc fine
[2023-10-03T23:03:03] NetworkDir: Just problem heat & shitty current problem
[2023-10-03T23:03:17] NetworkDir: Time to ubox alupcb
[2023-10-03T23:03:23] puneDir: so ure pulling more than 35a
[2023-10-03T23:03:47] NetworkDir: Yes currents just 1/2
[2023-10-03T23:03:55] NetworkDir: 100A = 50A
[2023-10-03T23:04:18] puneDir: weird
[2023-10-03T23:04:21] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Brooo how are they mounted
[2023-10-03T23:04:21] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Did you just throw them in or what is this with the boxes
[2023-10-03T23:05:01] NetworkDir: You mean fuses?
[2023-10-03T23:05:07] NetworkDir: Or vesc boxs
[2023-10-03T23:05:10] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No the black boxes
[2023-10-03T23:05:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Is this the vesc?
[2023-10-03T23:05:22] NetworkDir: Black boxs vesc
[2023-10-03T23:05:53] Finn: no wonder they overheat
[2023-10-03T23:06:20] NetworkDir: Thermal pad at up and down boxs
[2023-10-03T23:06:27] NetworkDir: Yep normal
[2023-10-03T23:06:37] NetworkDir: I can screw mosfets to frame
[2023-10-03T23:06:48] NetworkDir: But if current problem solved
[2023-10-03T23:06:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: well no wonder your cooling sucks
[2023-10-03T23:06:48] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Or did you do anything to mount them properly?
[2023-10-03T23:06:49] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: any esc will overheat like this
[2023-10-03T23:06:49] Finn: would make such a difference
[2023-10-03T23:07:00] NetworkDir: Yes
[2023-10-03T23:07:06] Finn: swap mosfets and you got a nice cool controller
[2023-10-03T23:07:16] NetworkDir: But in first this shit current problem must solve
[2023-10-03T23:07:23] NetworkDir: I just sell this ones to punedir
[2023-10-03T23:07:34] NetworkDir: Ubox colder and phase filter
[2023-10-03T23:07:42] Finn: yeah
[2023-10-03T23:07:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: üòÇ
[2023-10-03T23:07:45] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and 2x alupcb ubox won't fit this anyway
[2023-10-03T23:08:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes but how are you going to fit?
[2023-10-03T23:08:26] Finn: one bottom one top
[2023-10-03T23:08:29] NetworkDir: Space problem must can solve
[2023-10-03T23:08:46] puneDir: weird
[2023-10-03T23:08:52] Finn: xD
[2023-10-03T23:09:43] NetworkDir: Size: 102*57*21mm
[2023-10-03T23:09:46] NetworkDir: Ubox alupcb
[2023-10-03T23:11:05] NetworkDir: 130*110*50
[2023-10-03T23:11:08] NetworkDir: Space fine
[2023-10-03T23:11:35] NetworkDir: And if dont fit i have another way
[2023-10-03T23:11:39] NetworkDir: Spacer :)
[2023-10-03T23:11:49] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_10034@03-10-2023_23-11-49.jpg>
[2023-10-03T23:12:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Ok good
[2023-10-03T23:17:03] Andrius: Guys how tf I need to calculate phase current if battery bms could only do 120
[2023-10-03T23:17:44] Andrius: Cause now Im kinda without idea when I see someone battery current 100 and then phase at 200
[2023-10-03T23:18:00] Andrius: Literally Im lost here
[2023-10-03T23:18:21] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: You don't have to calculate phase current. Set the maximum battery current to whatever your BMS can do and motor current to what your motor & esc can handle
[2023-10-03T23:40:03] cihan: Do you think high temperatures like 80-90 degrees celcius will harm ESC on long term? Pcb can withstand probably and silicon behaves fine under 100 celcius, solders melt at very higher temperatures. I ask since I think about Ubox 100V 100A, not aluminum. I'll pull never more than 2kW.
[2023-10-03T23:40:20] cihan: And never more than 50A.
[2023-10-03T23:40:24] NetworkDir: Vesc fine for 70-80C ar max
[2023-10-03T23:40:56] NetworkDir: For your voltage and current you can use makerbase 75100
[2023-10-03T23:41:36] NetworkDir: Ubox 100V 100A good but alupcb better
[2023-10-03T23:42:07] cihan: I'm not sure but probably I'll never ever let BMS cut down. What do you think between 75100 and 60100HP?
[2023-10-03T23:42:22] NetworkDir: What your voltage and current
[2023-10-03T23:42:29] NetworkDir: Maximum
[2023-10-03T23:43:26] cihan: 54.6V for now. And maximum 50A, these are extremes. I'll never reach them under load. I won't force motor that much, or will I? üôÉ
[2023-10-03T23:44:00] cihan: 14 series or 15 series is enough for me forever.
[2023-10-03T23:44:10] NetworkDir: Your motor can handle 50A ?üòÇü•¥
[2023-10-03T23:44:21] cihan: We'll see. üôÉ
[2023-10-03T23:44:36] NetworkDir: Any vesc fine for you
[2023-10-03T23:44:42] NetworkDir: Because voltage amper low
[2023-10-03T23:44:58] NetworkDir: But which one better i don‚Äôt any idea
[2023-10-03T23:45:10] NetworkDir: Maybe 60100HP for you ?
[2023-10-03T23:46:04] cihan: My main purpose is adding more acceleration to navee and making it more responsive and have some fun with VESC adjustment. On long term I maybe buy Segway gt2 and never change anything it has in stock.
[2023-10-03T23:46:10] NetworkDir: Alupcb 60V(13s) 100A And stock V6.0 vesc
[2023-10-03T23:46:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs 13s max
[2023-10-03T23:46:38] NetworkDir: Ah but fine for cihan
[2023-10-03T23:46:42] NetworkDir: 48V
[2023-10-03T23:48:13] cihan: I also think so. In fact 13S is not that bad if I can make it 13S6P with good cells in future. 10S can do 32km easily if charge is over 40% with Ninebot.
[2023-10-03T23:48:49] NetworkDir: You have 2 way
[2023-10-03T23:48:54] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_10036@03-10-2023_23-48-54.jpg>
[2023-10-03T23:48:54] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_10037@03-10-2023_23-48-54.jpg>
[2023-10-03T23:49:04] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: this if you stay with 13s
[2023-10-03T23:49:10] NetworkDir: 75100 alupcb and 60100HP prices same
[2023-10-03T23:49:12] NetworkDir: Why
[2023-10-03T23:49:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: it's better?
[2023-10-03T23:49:41] NetworkDir: Maybe
[2023-10-03T23:50:07] cihan: Because of better Phase current sampling?
[2023-10-03T23:51:25] NetworkDir: Mosfets cool
[2023-10-03T23:51:28] NetworkDir: 300A‚ò†Ô∏è
[2023-10-03T23:52:00] NetworkDir: Offff
[2023-10-03T23:52:06] cihan: Does any of you use JK BMS? @NetworkDir @kawaiinekololis
[2023-10-03T23:52:07] NetworkDir: 1.2mOhm
[2023-10-03T23:52:14] NetworkDir: So cool
[2023-10-03T23:52:27] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No, I'm always using LLT/JBD BMS
[2023-10-03T23:53:19] cihan: I felt like I made up my mind with JK BMS but do you recommend something else? I want active balance for certain.
[2023-10-03T23:53:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It's the same like 75100 alu, but at least they use 8AWG on that one
[2023-10-03T23:53:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: Xd, 12 awg on the 75100
[2023-10-03T23:53:53] NetworkDir: Lol
[2023-10-03T23:54:09] NetworkDir: And i have a question
[2023-10-03T23:54:18] NetworkDir: 0-50kmh 3.7s good ?
[2023-10-03T23:54:41] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_10039@03-10-2023_23-54-41.jpg>
[2023-10-03T23:56:24] cihan: According to the tests I've read on riderguide.com, pretty good.
[2023-10-03T23:58:00] NetworkDir: With 65A (33A) battery current per controller 165A (83A) phase 265A (133A) abs phase 50A (25A) FWK Ramp time 0ms At 14s
[2023-10-03T23:58:52] cihan: Doesn't front tire spin a lot?
[2023-10-04T00:01:01] NetworkDir: Yes for preventing destroy tyres i use traction control ü•¥
[2023-10-04T00:05:06] cihan: I think your time is close to limits. Things could be dangerous if you put more power to rear tire. Scooter 's center of gravity is too high unlike a motorbike. It could be easy to wheelie.
[2023-10-04T00:06:56] NetworkDir: Powers fine anything stable
[2023-10-04T00:07:16] NetworkDir: Traction control fix anything
[2023-10-04T00:08:12] cihan: Ubox 80V 100A?
[2023-10-04T00:08:45] cihan: For the GT2 electric scooter, Segway has a stated acceleration of 0-30 mph in 3.9 seconds, but our tests had the scooter rocket to the 30 mph mark in 4.1 seconds. Not bad at all, given that the GT2 came fourth behind the fastest scooters we've ever tested, the NAMI BURN-E, Wolf King GT, and Apollo Pro Ludicrous.
[2023-10-04T00:10:44] cihan: If I won't be in trouble with makerbase, I think of it.
[2023-10-04T00:11:46] cihan: I sent a message as reply but I cannot see it.
[2023-10-04T00:12:29] cihan: It's both too expensive and beyond customs limit of 150 euros. I can only ask a friend abroad to bring it to me.
[2023-10-04T00:13:10] cihan: Can't I turn off scooter with makerbase? Will it stay on all the time? üôÉ
[2023-10-04T00:13:17] cihan: Unfortunately))
[2023-10-04T00:14:48] cihan: Unplug? Unplugging from the battery? I'm a little bit confused.
[2023-10-04T00:16:21] cihan: So should I place a switch somewhere outside of the deck? It's not so practical. Can't we just turn off BMS output with JK BMS app?
[2023-10-04T00:18:27] cihan: What if I place a parallel capacitor to BMS output?
[2023-10-04T00:20:26] cihan: What do you think about JK models? Do they all have rs485 and CANBUS? Aliexpress seller shares a table telling no, JK BMS official website says yes. I'll benefit from rs485 in future but I don't know if I'll ever need CANBUS on a BMS. However I can benefit from heat pad connection sometime in future.
[2023-10-04T00:20:42] cihan: I think I can solve it somehow.
[2023-10-04T00:21:35] cihan: Should I know this? Makerbase controller could be separated from power but only when not throttling?
[2023-10-04T00:22:16] cihan: I also think so. I read about it after you recommended JK and all good things.
[2023-10-04T01:38:54] haku: Hey guys im trying to rewire the phase cables for this motor its for a ninebot. Should i even put halls? Whats the difference between running a motor in vesc sensorless and with halls?
[2023-10-04T01:43:28] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: For vesc no matter which colors will be on phases
[2023-10-04T01:43:35] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Halls better!
[2023-10-04T01:44:42] haku: Thanks. Is there a big difference in motor behavior?
[2023-10-04T01:45:02] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Yeah
[2023-10-04T01:45:10] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: less sounds and better response
[2023-10-04T01:45:29] haku: Gotcha! Thank you
[2023-10-04T01:48:18] cihan: Wow, lots of copper inside, so many turns
[2023-10-04T01:49:07] haku: Its from a ninebot. I dont know what model exactly
[2023-10-04T01:50:52] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Ye, ninebot max insane :D
[2023-10-04T01:51:40] haku: I wonder if it can run on 60v. Lol
[2023-10-04T01:52:10] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: ...why not?üôÇ
[2023-10-04T01:52:27] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: I have seen one 23s project based on 1gen motor
[2023-10-04T01:52:40] cihan: It can but how long? :)
[2023-10-04T01:52:50] haku: Oh wow. Thats insane
[2023-10-04T01:53:09] cihan: Ninebot motor is nowhere similar to navee motor. Much more turns
[2023-10-04T01:53:24] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: I know one guy who runs 13s 40A on gen2 motor
[2023-10-04T01:53:54] haku: This is gen2 i believe
[2023-10-04T01:54:06] cihan: This is navee n65 motor.
[2023-10-04T01:54:07] cihan: <photos/photo_10041@04-10-2023_01-54-07.jpg>
[2023-10-04T01:54:47] haku: Nice!
[2023-10-04T01:54:56] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: ye it is, it have 9 wires in turn
[2023-10-04T01:55:30] haku: Thats crazy how you can tell by the windings.
[2023-10-04T01:57:15] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Gen 1 is have 6xxx serial number which means 6 wires in turn, I see on your photo more than 6 so I think it's 9xxx(gen 2)
[2023-10-04T01:58:01] haku: Oh i see what you mean. I didnt know the number on the serial meant that.
[2023-10-04T01:58:40] haku: I just found this scooter abandoned no battery and controller. Gonna make it run for my son
[2023-10-04T02:00:34] cihan: This is from Wikipedia. Wire quality matters. Is there a better wire resisting temperature over 250 degrees celcius? "Magnet wire insulating films use (in order of increasing temperature range) polyvinyl formal (Formvar), polyurethane, polyamide, polyester, polyester-polyimide, polyamide-polyimide (or amide-imide), and polyimide.[3] Polyimide insulated magnet wire is capable of operation at up to 250 ¬∞C (482 ¬∞F)." https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnet_wire#:~:text=Magnet%20wire%20insulating%20films%20use%20(in%20order%20of%20increasing%20temperature%20range)%20polyvinyl%20formal%20(Formvar)%2C%20polyurethane%2C%20polyamide%2C%20polyester%2C%20polyester%2Dpolyimide%2C%20polyamide%2Dpolyimide%20(or%20amide%2Dimide)%2C%20and%20polyimide.%5B3%5D%20Polyimide%20insulated%20magnet%20wire%20is%20capable%20of%20operation%20at%20up%20to%20250%C2%A0%C2%B0C%20(482%C2%A0%C2%B0F).
[2023-10-04T02:01:00] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: your son likes speed? :D
[2023-10-04T02:01:10] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: 60v on gen2 is very funny thing
[2023-10-04T02:01:30] haku: He will with proper gear.
[2023-10-04T02:03:17] NetworkDir: 6MCH121HUM0152 PuneDir motors
[2023-10-04T02:03:26] NetworkDir: And he want use 20s 30A
[2023-10-04T02:03:32] NetworkDir: ‚ò†Ô∏è
[2023-10-04T02:03:38] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: I know, he have snsc motors
[2023-10-04T02:03:54] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Gen1 rental, what's the problem of using them with 20s 30a?
[2023-10-04T02:04:01] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: It will hold it.
[2023-10-04T02:04:07] NetworkDir: Np just 160C
[2023-10-04T02:04:09] NetworkDir: <sticker>
[2023-10-04T02:04:18] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Few.
[2023-10-04T02:04:26] NetworkDir: also he say 40A
[2023-10-04T02:04:30] NetworkDir: with Field Weaking
[2023-10-04T02:04:30] NetworkDir: lmfao
[2023-10-04T02:04:43] NetworkDir: Motor life = 6 month max
[2023-10-04T02:04:59] NetworkDir: He must put oil into motor
[2023-10-04T02:04:59] NetworkDir: lol
[2023-10-04T02:05:07] cihan: 30A is like 1200W with low voltage, max current is 700W with stock ESC. Isn't it possible for 10inute ride?
[2023-10-04T02:05:20] NetworkDir: 20s
[2023-10-04T02:05:24] NetworkDir: 84*30 = 2520
[2023-10-04T02:05:25] NetworkDir: 2500W
[2023-10-04T02:05:40] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: my friend used g30 with 30+15 on 10s for like 11k km, motor inside looks IDEALLY PERFECT!!!!
[2023-10-04T02:05:52] NetworkDir: 10s diffrent with 20s
[2023-10-04T02:06:09] NetworkDir: my opinon ideal voltage for gen 1 13s
[2023-10-04T02:06:09] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: not so big difference imho
[2023-10-04T02:06:20] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: 16s better.
[2023-10-04T02:06:28] NetworkDir: High torque and 45-50 km/h top speed
[2023-10-04T02:06:28] cihan: But motor current will remain 30A, he just wants to overcome back EMF with high voltage.
[2023-10-04T02:06:43] NetworkDir: really ideal for city low distance travels
[2023-10-04T02:06:47] NetworkDir: i love it
[2023-10-04T02:07:05] NetworkDir: on the future i want sell my pro2 and purchase g30 48V
[2023-10-04T02:07:17] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: from downhill only üòÇ
[2023-10-04T02:07:34] NetworkDir: no with field weaking at flat road i see 45km/h
[2023-10-04T02:07:46] NetworkDir: 80-90kg driver
[2023-10-04T02:08:02] cihan: No, he won't be using whole voltage if he doesn't go beyond 30A, it's just to have headroom and maybe not to let BMS cut off. :)
[2023-10-04T02:08:05] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: field weakening for weak people ü•±üò¥
[2023-10-04T02:08:06] NetworkDir: but current i don't remember
[2023-10-04T02:08:09] NetworkDir: lol
[2023-10-04T02:11:25] cihan: 13S is really more than enough for me if battery capacity is high. I don't think I'll ever need such high voltage. But I don't know why stock battery of ninebot is not 11S. 10S cannot supply enough voltage under 40% battery and I cannot reach 32 km/h.
[2023-10-04T02:23:47] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: 10s is common voltage GG, stock speed on g30/G30D on eu/de firmware is 20-25kph, only USA G30P with gen2 can go 30
[2023-10-04T02:29:11] haku: What temp sensor/ thermistor that will work with vesc? Anyone have a link?
[2023-10-04T02:31:13] haku: Aliexpress link would be awsome.
[2023-10-04T02:35:10] cihan: Trying to make voltages 12 and multiples seems strange to me
[2023-10-04T04:11:10] Eric Howat: Under ADC what do I change for traction control?
[2023-10-04T05:30:23] haku: I think i saw it under ADC/general tab.
[2023-10-04T05:30:49] Eric Howat: Do you know what it‚Äôs labeled as?
[2023-10-04T05:31:30] haku: <photos/photo_10042@04-10-2023_05-31-30.jpg>
[2023-10-04T06:20:19] haku: I have this heatsink for a ubox 100/100. If i mount it would it even make a difference in mosfet temp? Its just going to stay inside the deck. Does it even matter?
[2023-10-04T06:21:18] haku: If i was going to mount it i will be usimg thermal paste for cpu.
[2023-10-04T12:46:20] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: no
[2023-10-04T12:46:25] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: there is no air flow inside your scooter
[2023-10-04T12:47:59] Mirono escooters: It'll just delay overheating BCS more thermal mass
[2023-10-04T13:10:56] Happy Giraffe: @jamessoderstrom could we put a parallel rhetostatic module to battery with diodes? If batt cuts out then excess bemf goes to the moduleü§î
[2023-10-04T13:11:55] Happy Giraffe: Im just wondering if it could protect the flipskysüòÇ
[2023-10-04T13:13:13] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, atleast it would provide a path for excess electricity
[2023-10-04T13:13:13] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-10-04T13:13:18] Mirono escooters: But why
[2023-10-04T13:13:35] Happy Giraffe: Just a playful thought in the middle of the week
[2023-10-04T13:13:44] Mirono escooters: Fair enough
[2023-10-04T13:19:30] cihan: I was just seeking this information.
[2023-10-04T13:19:54] cihan: I didn't know why it died when BMS cut off
[2023-10-04T13:20:02] cihan: I'm not kidding
[2023-10-04T13:20:39] NetworkDir: Shit and wrong design?
[2023-10-04T13:21:45] cihan: Maybe, lack of protection, it means wrong design for me. Not well thought.
[2023-10-04T15:11:41] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_10044@04-10-2023_15-11-41.jpg>
[2023-10-04T15:11:50] Mirono escooters: I love this connector. Anyone got a name?
[2023-10-04T15:11:53] Mirono escooters: Inokim
[2023-10-04T15:20:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: Julet
[2023-10-04T15:25:54] Happy Giraffe: Btw if someone wants a battery box on footrest I will happily make one from 3mm alu sheetüòÇ. Would be insane capacity thenüòÖ
[2023-10-04T15:26:42] Happy Giraffe: My box turned out pretty well even as my first unit and easily takes a direct hit onto a rock etc
[2023-10-04T16:23:44] Oreo huzky: Jerald
[2023-10-04T16:35:48] Happy Giraffe: L1019 is masterrace and HiGo 6-pin
[2023-10-04T16:37:21] Happy Giraffe: L1019 sadly only for ~100A phase, good for lightly tuned xiaomi/G30 with stock motors
[2023-10-04T16:43:52] Mirono escooters: That's cool
[2023-10-04T16:43:56] Mirono escooters: I buy sum
[2023-10-04T16:45:55] Happy Giraffe: They are insanely nice, waterproof connector with solid locking ring
[2023-10-04T16:49:05] Mirono escooters: Yess
[2023-10-04T16:49:09] Mirono escooters: For my G30 purfect
[2023-10-04T16:55:36] Happy Giraffe: These new connectors nice AF. First gen ones were pain to put in and out
[2023-10-04T17:01:41] Oreo huzky: 732‚Ç¨ good for dualtron thunder?
[2023-10-04T17:01:49] NetworkDir: thunder 1?
[2023-10-04T17:02:37] NetworkDir: 35Ah 60V
[2023-10-04T17:02:38] NetworkDir: not bad
[2023-10-04T17:03:41] Oreo huzky: It has 1000km been driven I would sell everything in it and just keep the frame
[2023-10-04T17:05:53] Oreo huzky: Is it possible to remove the rear footrest of Thunder 2?
[2023-10-04T17:25:33] sombre_enfant: Yes
[2023-10-04T18:00:04] Oreo huzky: Can thunder two hold 75mm motors?
[2023-10-04T18:06:21] Happy Giraffe: @koxx3 Do you know how can I install a key switch as a powerbutton to the 80v100A alu ubox?
[2023-10-04T18:07:04] Happy Giraffe: The switch just closes circuit when key is turned
[2023-10-04T18:07:21] Happy Giraffe: So only 2 wires for that

[2023-10-04T19:06:24] Oreo huzky: Aw
[2023-10-04T19:06:40] Oreo huzky: Can I modify it to fit 75mm?
[2023-10-04T19:08:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: Even 90h
[2023-10-04T19:08:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: But you need the modified cartridge axle
[2023-10-04T19:35:59] Oreo huzky: Is it hard to modify
[2023-10-04T19:36:05] Oreo huzky: Is there a kit ?

[2023-10-04T21:42:53] Oreo huzky: The throttle cable suddenly came loose when driving and it gave full throttle I hate the cl350 plugs they are soo scetchy
[2023-10-04T21:43:33] puneDir: how u stopped
[2023-10-04T21:43:57] puneDir: Why tf vesc gives full power when it disconnects
[2023-10-04T21:44:10] puneDir: i mean what to do if accelerometer fails
[2023-10-04T21:45:43] Oreo huzky: Brakes
[2023-10-04T21:47:21] Mirono escooters: Sadly thats how the throttles work
[2023-10-04T21:47:31] Mirono escooters: Heh, did a wheelie and had bike flying out underneath me
[2023-10-04T21:56:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: Wow never happened to me with those connectors x)
[2023-10-04T21:56:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: You must have lost the GND, right ?
[2023-10-04T22:13:18] Oreo huzky: Maybe
[2023-10-04T22:14:34] Oreo huzky: The vesc is great but the cables are scary maybe I mounted wrong I will glue the cables so this never happens again almost got a heartattack
[2023-10-04T22:31:57] Happy Giraffe: Newest invention, parallel ADC1üåö so can use brake as throttle if I wantüòÇ

[2023-10-04T23:36:33] Oreo huzky: Yes gnd pin was loose
[2023-10-04T23:40:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, if you loose GND, then 5V goes through signal, no matter the type of controller
[2023-10-04T23:41:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: You can basically avoid it from spftware lol
[2023-10-04T23:41:36] Mirono escooters: I accidentally ripped my sensor out of throttle
[2023-10-04T23:41:41] Mirono escooters: Then also 100% power xd
[2023-10-04T23:42:51] Oreo huzky: I will solder the gnd cable so it won‚Äôt happen my bad cl350 are totally fine just me doing bad work
[2023-10-04T23:43:14] Mirono escooters: I barely use connectors anymore
[2023-10-04T23:43:17] Mirono escooters: Only problems
[2023-10-04T23:43:26] Happy Giraffe: How?üòÅ
[2023-10-04T23:43:41] Happy Giraffe: Safe start you mean?
[2023-10-04T23:43:56] Happy Giraffe: And maximum voltage limits for throttle?
[2023-10-04T23:44:38] Oreo huzky: If e brake gnd is not connected than that could mean that is not connected right because it was reading that e brake was half pressed all the time ?
[2023-10-04T23:45:24] Oreo huzky: And e brake and throttle gnd and positive wire can be connected together correct?
[2023-10-04T23:46:59] Oreo huzky: And also when I press e brake when the throttle thing happens will it stop the motors?
[2023-10-04T23:48:09] Happy Giraffe: üëç
[2023-10-04T23:50:36] cihan: I've pulled the trigger and ordered a JK BMS. Now I need a controller. üôÉ
[2023-10-04T23:50:47] Happy Giraffe: Vescüåö
[2023-10-04T23:51:53] cihan: Thanks everybody for help about BMS, especially @jamessoderstrom @kawaiinekololis
[2023-10-04T23:54:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2023-10-04T23:57:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: They‚Äôre already common from themselves
[2023-10-05T00:00:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: Its new feature
[2023-10-05T00:00:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: No was available before 6.05
[2023-10-05T00:02:02] cihan: Thank you, I wish so. I read some negative reviews from people using it with solar system but it was about the inverter cut off voltage. They got rid of the problem easily when they decreased the inverter's low battery cut off voltage and let the JK BMS handle it. They use rs485 connection with BMS. On the other hand there are really cheap 15-20 USD active balancing 15S 40A BMS and there are really bad reviews about them telling they just stopped working and never came back to life. So I didn't want to risk it. It costed me 80 USD and 110 USD in total with shipping, tax minus some coin discount. I ordered from aliexpress.
[2023-10-05T00:06:14] cihan: Me too, reliability brings more joy to life.
[2023-10-05T00:24:55] haku: Hey guys the mosfets on my dual ubox is reaching 80+degrees. How would you guys suggest i mount it with? Thermal paste or thermal pad. I will be mounting it inside the deck if possible
[2023-10-05T00:29:02] haku: Is 80+ degrees normal for vesc?

[2023-10-05T00:30:25] haku: Which vesc is that? And how did you mount it?
[2023-10-05T00:30:43] haku: I need your skills sir
[2023-10-05T00:31:02] NetworkDir: Mks 75100 Just simple thermal pad at down and up vescs
[2023-10-05T00:31:09] NetworkDir: Also thermal paste at mosfets
[2023-10-05T00:31:56] haku: Gotcha. Thank you i will try that. Do you have a fan inside?
[2023-10-05T00:32:20] NetworkDir: No
[2023-10-05T00:33:13] haku: Ok. Thanks again. I will try to do that with ubox. I just dont think spintend provided me mounting screws lol
[2023-10-05T00:33:48] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_10056@05-10-2023_00-33-48.jpg>

[2023-10-05T00:36:00] Happy Giraffe: I sleep at night knowing there's a fire alarm on top of my battery with Daly bms‚ò†
[2023-10-05T00:36:06] haku: Its not mounted its just fumbling in the deck lol. I thought i can get away with it
[2023-10-05T00:37:35] Happy Giraffe: Mounting bolts are m3 or m4 so found on every store
[2023-10-05T00:37:53] haku: I will do that. Is cpu thermal paste better than pad? I have a bunch of paste for cpu
[2023-10-05T00:40:08] NetworkDir: Normal like old

[2023-10-05T01:17:29] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: kek
[2023-10-05T02:23:12] cihan: If this is the scooter you do 50km/h in 3.9 seconds, you're probably pulling hard on stem. I could just think of it if it's not caused by riding hard. Somehow I always think stem is just too thin and too long to handle high moments.
[2023-10-05T02:26:42] NetworkDir: Actually, the main reason is because of the problem with my rear brake, that I was temporarily always using the front brake. Also tried a lot for wheelie :) It was natural that this stem had the maximum durability of its strength, it would not break now, it would break in the future, maybe at very high speeds. In short, I will make a resistant and good stem for it
[2023-10-05T02:32:49] cihan: You can consider double butted or triple butted aluminum if you want to make it light while keeping same strength but it'll be more expensive. Maybe steel could be option, not rigid as aluminum but can withstand forces better but much heavier.
[2023-10-05T02:33:30] cihan: Wheelie is a big no no :)
[2023-10-05T02:33:37] NetworkDir: .
[2023-10-05T02:34:05] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_10062@05-10-2023_02-34-05.jpg>
[2023-10-05T02:35:05] cihan: It's a better solution than double butted aluminum probably. That cuff (I'm not sure if I use correct word for that piece) could be even longer.
[2023-10-05T02:35:24] NetworkDir: Yes
[2023-10-05T02:35:29] NetworkDir: Like DT stems
[2023-10-05T02:35:44] NetworkDir: Like dualtron stems
[2023-10-05T02:35:47] NetworkDir: without hole
[2023-10-05T02:36:30] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_10064@05-10-2023_02-36-30.jpg>
[2023-10-05T02:37:46] cihan: Certainly much more durable.
[2023-10-05T02:47:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: The circle tube is technically more durable and stronger to be stem, but in this case dualtron is better because of thicker and better material

[2023-10-05T03:03:50] Oreo huzky: GPS Speed
[2023-10-05T03:03:56] NetworkDir: 97km/h good
[2023-10-05T03:04:02] NetworkDir: but for 17kW like low idk
[2023-10-05T03:04:33] Oreo huzky: I didn‚Äôt had helmet on and only a very short straight 350Meters
[2023-10-05T03:04:46] NetworkDir: Sure
[2023-10-05T03:05:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: Why don‚Äôt use gps speed app?
[2023-10-05T03:05:10] Oreo huzky: But the acceleration is out of this world I can hardly keep myself on the scooter
[2023-10-05T03:05:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: The most reliable one
[2023-10-05T03:05:15] Oreo huzky: I did
[2023-10-05T03:05:20] Oreo huzky: Here
[2023-10-05T03:05:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Name of app is ‚Äúgps speed‚Äù
[2023-10-05T03:05:36] Oreo huzky: Ah
[2023-10-05T03:05:49] Oreo huzky: Mine is called speed tracker
[2023-10-05T03:05:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: All other app has very slow referesh rate with wrong data
[2023-10-05T03:06:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: So you maybe was faster , or slower
[2023-10-05T03:06:15] NetworkDir: this one?
[2023-10-05T03:06:22] Oreo huzky: And I did some test with my car and speed was really accurate if cellular connection is good
[2023-10-05T03:06:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not
[2023-10-05T03:06:37] NetworkDir: Google play serach engine shitty if possible send url
[2023-10-05T03:07:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: Or they change name
[2023-10-05T03:07:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is ‚Äúspeed view gps ‚Äú
[2023-10-05T03:07:46] NetworkDir: Ah
[2023-10-05T03:07:56] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_10068@05-10-2023_03-07-56.jpg>
[2023-10-05T03:07:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yeah and you know car has wrong speed by default üòÇ
[2023-10-05T03:08:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes

[2023-10-05T03:09:03] Oreo huzky: It‚Äôs a relatively new car so I guess it‚Äôs accurate
[2023-10-05T03:09:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: But also small current
[2023-10-05T03:10:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: Cheap flipsky
[2023-10-05T03:10:24] Oreo huzky: What
[2023-10-05T03:10:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: Without cooling
[2023-10-05T03:10:31] Oreo huzky: How
[2023-10-05T03:10:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: What how
[2023-10-05T03:10:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs how it performs lol
[2023-10-05T03:10:51] Oreo huzky: Then cl350 should get higher correct?
[2023-10-05T03:11:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes because is up to 30s
[2023-10-05T03:11:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: U will get higher temp
[2023-10-05T03:11:31] Oreo huzky: I have it mounted to frame with thermal paste
[2023-10-05T03:11:38] Oreo huzky: I mean higher current
[2023-10-05T03:11:45] NetworkDir: Alupcb version ?
[2023-10-05T03:11:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: Lower current
[2023-10-05T03:12:00] Oreo huzky: Why that
[2023-10-05T03:12:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Higher voltage fets has always higher resistance too, so less current supported
[2023-10-05T03:12:31] NetworkDir: Your real max power like: 12-15kW and 250-300A I MAX
[2023-10-05T03:12:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: What bullshit are you saying
[2023-10-05T03:12:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: <sticker>
[2023-10-05T03:13:05] NetworkDir: .
[2023-10-05T03:13:10] Oreo huzky: And if I use 20s can I get it up to 450A?
[2023-10-05T03:13:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: 75200 alu
[2023-10-05T03:13:17] NetworkDir: Ok
[2023-10-05T03:13:36] NetworkDir: At first I thought you were saying 75100 :)
[2023-10-05T03:13:41] Oreo huzky: And I am Jesus Christ
[2023-10-05T03:13:50] NetworkDir: That's why I said this because these values ‚Äã‚Äãare impossible
[2023-10-05T03:14:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Why not? The power board is exactly the same as c350
[2023-10-05T03:14:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: If your board gone, don‚Äôt mean mine too üòÇ
[2023-10-05T03:14:59] Oreo huzky: So I could do 650A with c350
[2023-10-05T03:15:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: You‚Äôve cl350 not c350
[2023-10-05T03:15:45] Oreo huzky: Yes
[2023-10-05T03:15:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: And technically u can but no recommended
[2023-10-05T03:15:55] Oreo huzky: But if I had c350
[2023-10-05T03:16:03] Oreo huzky: But why can you?
[2023-10-05T03:16:29] NetworkDir: CL350 (36-126 v (8-30s safe)) CL350 : 400Phase, 180Battery
[2023-10-05T03:16:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: What why i can?
[2023-10-05T03:17:13] Oreo huzky: Isn‚Äôt that the specs vor cl350 v4
[2023-10-05T03:17:40] NetworkDir: Maybe
[2023-10-05T03:18:13] Oreo huzky: I have v3 üò™
[2023-10-05T03:18:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: Cl350 is half of the power than c350 according the mosfet datasheet
[2023-10-05T03:19:16] Oreo huzky: Hm but It can go 30s so
[2023-10-05T03:19:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: And why you need 30s
[2023-10-05T03:19:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: What speed you want to do?
[2023-10-05T03:20:20] NetworkDir: Ubox V2 100V 200A Dual Motor vs 2x Ubox alu pcb 80V 100A vs 2x 75200 alupcb shitsky ?
[2023-10-05T03:20:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: For power flipsky the best
[2023-10-05T03:21:16] Oreo huzky: Speeed
[2023-10-05T03:21:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: How much ?
[2023-10-05T03:21:27] NetworkDir: For stablity and quality ubox the best
[2023-10-05T03:21:33] Oreo huzky: Just speed
[2023-10-05T03:21:42] Oreo huzky: 150+
[2023-10-05T03:21:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: 22s is enough
[2023-10-05T03:22:02] NetworkDir: Also 75200 have a problems like randomly or cut off burns?
[2023-10-05T03:22:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: They does 153 with 20s as I saw
[2023-10-05T03:22:22] Oreo huzky: Maybe if everything works 170+ but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs achievable
[2023-10-05T03:22:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: You need the torque as well for high speed, not voltage only
[2023-10-05T03:23:12] Oreo huzky: Yes I have I currently have high torque motors
[2023-10-05T03:23:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: Oh the Huameng super small motor
[2023-10-05T03:24:01] Oreo huzky: Why you always so negative
[2023-10-05T03:24:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: My personality
[2023-10-05T03:24:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: And facts
[2023-10-05T03:24:30] Oreo huzky: It‚Äôs just annoying
[2023-10-05T03:24:34] NetworkDir: Ah phase filter not available at 75200 :)
[2023-10-05T03:24:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: All products I had, and I would never recommend to anybody
[2023-10-05T03:24:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: Huameng waste me 400‚Ç¨ for fake 1600w motors
[2023-10-05T03:25:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: As well friends with fake 8000w motors
[2023-10-05T03:25:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: I hate how they scam people with over rated values
[2023-10-05T03:26:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: Don‚Äôt ask why rage mechanics and me , don‚Äôt sell their motors
[2023-10-05T03:26:38] NetworkDir: they sell shitty 5$ controllers. normal to selling fake shitty motors
[2023-10-05T03:33:02] Oreo huzky: But if it wasn‚Äôt 8000W how would it handle 380A?
[2023-10-05T04:28:38] haku: What sensor do you guys attach to the motor for reading temp. And how do you guys attach it epoxy or silicone? Sorry im new. Need an adult
[2023-10-05T04:37:32] haku: Or you guys just buy the motor with a temp sensor?
[2023-10-05T04:39:51] Eric Howat: So I just wired a surron headlight on to a vesc Ubox j 75v100a x2‚Äôs 12v light port directly and I have no light. Same with using the brake light switch
[2023-10-05T04:40:20] Eric Howat: Do I need to turn it on because neither lights work
[2023-10-05T05:00:13] haku: Would any thermistor work?
[2023-10-05T06:58:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Just because you cannot manage to get your firmware working correctly, it's not the same for everybody...
[2023-10-05T07:45:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: You can also with CL350, just set higher motor current
[2023-10-05T07:46:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: Careful, it was on track circuit, open road will be higher speed
[2023-10-05T07:56:12] Happy Giraffe: I love the sass
[2023-10-05T08:08:52] Oreo huzky: Defently
[2023-10-05T08:34:42] haku: Would this work for a thermistor in the hub?
[2023-10-05T08:56:49] puneDir: why not
[2023-10-05T08:59:38] cihan: Will Bluetooth work? Hub motor is like Faraday cage.
[2023-10-05T09:01:06] haku: Sorry i didnt know that was bluetooth. Im just guessing hopefully get an answer.
[2023-10-05T09:02:27] haku: I think i have to wire it to ground and vesc temp plug.
[2023-10-05T09:12:21] cihan: I don't know either. But I thought so from the printing on it.
[2023-10-05T09:12:52] cihan: Don't you want to measure motor temperature?
[2023-10-05T09:14:57] haku: Yes. I do not have a semsor. I want to rewire it and put longer phase cables. Also wanted to add a temp sensor. Hopefully the vesc lords will help
[2023-10-05T09:20:03] Andrius: I wouldnt say 50kmh in 3.9 is fast
[2023-10-05T09:25:38] cihan: I think stem will start being so much stresaed for higher.
[2023-10-05T10:14:09] Happy Giraffe: Rewire? Why not just solder longer and thicker cables 30cm after cable exit?üòÅ
[2023-10-05T10:37:53] Andrius: Im wondering whats the possible fastest 0-50 time
[2023-10-05T10:38:38] Andrius: Cause im doing 3.5s 0-50 on stock nami
[2023-10-05T10:42:41] Pablo Fernandez: stock nami torque is impressive
[2023-10-05T10:50:29] heimdler: Any recommendations for front signal lights?
[2023-10-05T10:51:57] heimdler: Thanks to community, ordered this and they've arrived. So I'm looking for something for the front to accompany it
[2023-10-05T10:59:17] Andrius: Now got some responses from local nami riders, one got down to 3.2sec 0-50
[2023-10-05T10:59:43] Andrius: So Im wondering if anyone got with vesc under 3secs?
[2023-10-05T11:00:27] Pablo Fernandez: i dont have dragy to test it but tbf if i would need pmt to grip better on launch and get better times anyways
[2023-10-05T11:01:46] Andrius: Ya guy I was mentioning that did 3.2 he was on perfect conditons with PMT
[2023-10-05T11:02:04] Andrius: Mine 3.5sec was on cold tyres on cold weather, also PMT tyres
[2023-10-05T11:29:47] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Got no grip so probably no :(
[2023-10-05T11:30:13] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: also drag racer app won't work with my shit replacement phone.
[2023-10-05T11:57:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: Measures with what? Please don‚Äôt tell me smartphone
[2023-10-05T12:04:23] Andrius: Mine was with smartphone, 3.2 was with draggy
[2023-10-05T12:05:28] Andrius: But I wouldnt say S23 ultra does bad with speed measurement, cause it tracks me pretty good watching on maps
[2023-10-05T12:06:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: All phones are no good
[2023-10-05T12:06:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs the point, for measure speed phone is good, acceleration not
[2023-10-05T12:12:57] Andrius: False, I could argue here, flagships does have pretty insane gyroscopes, they can measure acceleration pretty accurate, but still as I said 3.2sec 0-50 was done with draggy, my time 3.5 was done on phone
[2023-10-05T12:14:49] Andrius: Forgot to include accelerometer in this, still I think you get what Im trying to say
[2023-10-05T12:15:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yah okay, so everyone buy dragy are stupid because don‚Äôt know how to waste money
[2023-10-05T12:30:39] Andrius: Does everyone buy racelogic? No because it is expensive, dragy is cheap, and measures pretty good if your scooter has an 2g or more acceleration till 100 atleast ok phone is not gonna be as accurate, but as our scooters dont pull that much G phone does pretty good job
[2023-10-05T12:36:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: üëç
[2023-10-05T12:41:05] puneDir: Whats the max battery internal resistence difference to pack it
[2023-10-05T12:41:09] puneDir: gonna be 20s
[2023-10-05T12:42:00] Mirono escooters: Anything else then delta 0 is shit ;)
[2023-10-05T12:42:09] puneDir: what about 3?
[2023-10-05T12:42:44] puneDir: will it be fine if charged every day?
[2023-10-05T12:43:10] Mirono escooters: ü§∑ü§∑ü§∑ü§∑
[2023-10-05T12:43:26] Mirono escooters: If u ain't abusing it
[2023-10-05T14:45:36] NetworkDir: I did not ask for your opinion in this message
[2023-10-05T14:45:59] NetworkDir: I was talking to Pablo because
[2023-10-05T14:46:14] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I did not ask for your response to my message
[2023-10-05T15:05:27] Luis Magalhaes: Talk in private...
[2023-10-05T15:14:33] cihan: It's probably among 3 fastest, maybe fastest one.
[2023-10-05T15:30:16] Andrius: Theres a list?
[2023-10-05T15:43:18] Pablo Fernandez: Rider guide has one
[2023-10-05T15:43:32] Pablo Fernandez: Wolf King gtr and inmotion rs are faster. Nami is 3rd
[2023-10-05T16:14:28] sombre_enfant: Teverun 7260r?
[2023-10-05T16:39:44] Pablo Fernandez: Not on the list, they havent tested It i think
[2023-10-05T18:58:28] Happy Giraffe: Anyone still know how to connect on-off key to new 80v100A Alu vesc?
[2023-10-05T18:59:37] Happy Giraffe: This
[2023-10-05T19:10:11] KierreKikkeli: <video_file>
[2023-10-05T19:10:26] KierreKikkeli: Last time used pc to manually set the values -.-
[2023-10-05T19:27:38] KierreKikkeli: tcp bridge ftw
[2023-10-05T19:28:23] KierreKikkeli: .......
[2023-10-05T19:29:19] NetworkDir: :(
[2023-10-05T19:29:52] KierreKikkeli: also why does it say im on limited mode?
[2023-10-05T19:29:57] KierreKikkeli: both on phone and pc
[2023-10-05T19:30:00] KierreKikkeli: paid software
[2023-10-05T19:32:05] NetworkDir: Tcp bridge with esp32 ?
[2023-10-05T19:32:21] NetworkDir: Check rx tx pins maybe reverse
[2023-10-05T19:33:05] KierreKikkeli: nope, all wires properly soldered and color coded
[2023-10-05T19:33:41] KierreKikkeli: tcp bridge through mobile phone
[2023-10-05T19:33:56] NetworkDir: Ah ok. At phone works ?
[2023-10-05T19:34:27] KierreKikkeli: yeah but cant adjust the input values manually so the brake and throttle get reversed
[2023-10-05T19:34:48] NetworkDir: Check your windows firewall or your internet router
[2023-10-05T19:34:54] NetworkDir: Maybe port and protocol limited
[2023-10-05T19:35:07] Happy Giraffe: Reversed?
[2023-10-05T19:35:18] Happy Giraffe: Adc1 always throttle and adc2 brake
[2023-10-05T19:35:30] KierreKikkeli: same as before, throttle does nothing, brake lever acts as throttle even tho its adc 1
[2023-10-05T19:35:34] Happy Giraffe: And there's option if it's reversed
[2023-10-05T19:35:43] KierreKikkeli: but instead of normally it acts as a reverse throttle
[2023-10-05T19:35:53] KierreKikkeli: and brake at the same time
[2023-10-05T19:36:14] Happy Giraffe: Show adc settings

[2023-10-05T19:39:10] KierreKikkeli: Reverse or not acts same way
[2023-10-05T19:40:23] KierreKikkeli: ah found the manual settings on the phone, will try to adjust those
[2023-10-05T19:41:00] Happy Giraffe: You have brake button
[2023-10-05T19:41:11] Happy Giraffe: You need "no reverse brake"
[2023-10-05T19:41:35] KierreKikkeli: Ye wont work properly anyways xd
[2023-10-05T19:42:01] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_10079@05-10-2023_19-42-01.jpg>
[2023-10-05T19:42:18] Happy Giraffe: Still wrong
[2023-10-05T19:42:21] Happy Giraffe: You need "no reverse brake"
[2023-10-05T19:42:41] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_10080@05-10-2023_19-42-41.jpg>
[2023-10-05T19:42:46] KierreKikkeli: Yeah doesnt matter
[2023-10-05T19:44:24] Happy Giraffe: Maybe you switched adc1 and 2 wires in adc module or something
[2023-10-05T19:44:27] KierreKikkeli: <video_file>
[2023-10-05T19:44:29] Happy Giraffe: Or spintend put them wrong idk
[2023-10-05T19:44:57] KierreKikkeli: wouldnt explain why both modes act the same
[2023-10-05T19:45:10] KierreKikkeli: as in brake being both reverse gas and e brake
[2023-10-05T19:45:29] KierreKikkeli: could try to update firmware to 6.02 to see if it helps
[2023-10-05T19:46:18] Pablo Fernandez: To solder cables should i use flux on It or is It not a must
[2023-10-05T19:46:39] Happy Giraffe: Small bit helps
[2023-10-05T19:47:23] Happy Giraffe: Double check wiring from adc1 Nd 2 pins
[2023-10-05T19:48:04] KierreKikkeli: it worked just fine for 100km correctly when i set the voltages up manually with pc
[2023-10-05T19:48:06] haku: That would be a good solution but the phase cables on these motors are known to burn. It says 14 awg but its really 18 awg. When i build my new pack i want thicker cables and a temp sensor
[2023-10-05T19:48:28] KierreKikkeli: uploading 6.02 to see if a bug with vesc fw
[2023-10-05T19:48:43] KierreKikkeli: if not manual voltage input start and end it is
[2023-10-05T19:48:59] KierreKikkeli: now that i found em on the phone and with 6.02 i can also use pc for it
[2023-10-05T19:51:09] Happy Giraffe: What did you change?
[2023-10-05T19:53:37] KierreKikkeli: motor input to large outrunner and input mapping felt off so wanted to re map iut
[2023-10-05T19:53:38] KierreKikkeli: it
[2023-10-05T19:55:40] KierreKikkeli: or the input has been feeling off for a while so im just now remapping it
[2023-10-05T19:55:58] KierreKikkeli: + if i update the firmware i dont get the annoying popup anymore so might aswell
[2023-10-05T19:58:39] Happy Giraffe: Remap might help but thats a weird issue
[2023-10-05T19:59:31] KierreKikkeli: i mean, u told me to "just put it on medium outrunner" last time and i havent changed it since XD
[2023-10-05T19:59:38] KierreKikkeli: and thats what 1-2 months ago?
[2023-10-05T20:02:59] KierreKikkeli: ah cool, updated fw no more limited mode
[2023-10-05T20:03:12] KierreKikkeli: wtf
[2023-10-05T20:03:15] KierreKikkeli: it is 6.02
[2023-10-05T20:05:28] Happy Giraffe: Yup thats correct but then you did some large outrunner stuff after?
[2023-10-05T20:06:14] Happy Giraffe: It's just for measuring motor characteristics nothing more
[2023-10-05T20:06:23] KierreKikkeli: the vsett 10+ is a large outrunner at 4,4kg no?
[2023-10-05T20:06:51] Happy Giraffe: We usually measure with medium
[2023-10-05T20:07:11] KierreKikkeli: yeah but 1400w motor isnt the usual XD
[2023-10-05T20:07:34] KierreKikkeli: and if i recall i was initially told to use large outrunner here by others using vsett 10+
[2023-10-05T20:22:25] KierreKikkeli: 20K erpm with the 80v controller
[2023-10-05T20:22:33] KierreKikkeli: if based on battery its halved
[2023-10-05T20:23:06] KierreKikkeli: assuming the common frequency is 16
[2023-10-05T20:26:42] KierreKikkeli: or more sensibly
[2023-10-05T20:26:46] KierreKikkeli: with my 12s
[2023-10-05T20:27:56] KierreKikkeli: oh cool, used "update all" on the vesc firmware update and now the ble shows up on pc
[2023-10-05T20:28:38] Mirono escooters: This is not for brushless tho?
[2023-10-05T20:28:39] KierreKikkeli: or not xd
[2023-10-05T20:29:19] Mirono escooters: Kv √ó v is rpm
[2023-10-05T20:29:23] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_10086@05-10-2023_20-29-23.jpg>
[2023-10-05T20:29:27] Mirono escooters: Frequency has nothing to do with it
[2023-10-05T20:29:36] Mirono escooters: Yeah, super good source. 10/10
[2023-10-05T20:29:42] KierreKikkeli: XD
[2023-10-05T20:29:51] Mirono escooters: Can we just ban chatgpt from jere
[2023-10-05T20:29:54] Mirono escooters: Punedir tried too
[2023-10-05T20:30:02] Mirono escooters: It's just stupid and never on point
[2023-10-05T20:30:18] KierreKikkeli: true couldnt even do basic math
[2023-10-05T20:30:47] KierreKikkeli: but im trying to figure out erpm instead of rpm
[2023-10-05T20:31:29] Mirono escooters: And why?
[2023-10-05T20:31:51] Mirono escooters: Just forget about frequency, it doesn't influence speed.. diff type motor
[2023-10-05T20:32:12] Mirono escooters: https://vesc-project.com/node/2932
[2023-10-05T20:32:34] Mirono escooters: if it's a direct drive, probably the easiest low tech way is to spin the motor with a known RPM and then eRPM / RPM = pole pairs. You can also open up the motor and count the number of magnets. Tadaa
[2023-10-05T20:32:36] Mirono escooters: Google, 1 min :)
[2023-10-05T20:33:46] KierreKikkeli: i do know the pole count tho
[2023-10-05T20:34:11] KierreKikkeli: but ye, difference between medium outrunner and large outrunner seems to just be the max power loss
[2023-10-05T20:36:20] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_10087@05-10-2023_20-36-20.jpg>
[2023-10-05T20:37:52] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_10088@05-10-2023_20-37-52.jpg>
[2023-10-05T20:38:33] KierreKikkeli: eh anyways i can finally adjust the input mapping on pc through tcp bridge xd
[2023-10-05T20:55:27] KierreKikkeli: on the input note, yeah, vesc tools input mapping is just drunk and the start voltage needs to be adjusted manually
[2023-10-05T20:56:19] KierreKikkeli: its assuming the center voltage is 0,84 no matter what
[2023-10-05T20:57:46] KierreKikkeli: as in
[2023-10-05T20:58:51] KierreKikkeli: and now it works again
[2023-10-05T21:00:09] Mirono escooters: A software issue is usually between chair and monitor
[2023-10-05T21:00:29] KierreKikkeli: im aware of it way too much
[2023-10-05T21:01:35] KierreKikkeli: but it slapping the center voltage to be actual starting voltage and starting voltage to be under what it gives on idle makes it go nuts
[2023-10-05T21:02:03] KierreKikkeli: even if i leave the throttle half way like instructed it still uses incorrect values
[2023-10-05T21:03:06] KierreKikkeli: the stock throttle idles at 0.85 by default, or atleast mine does no matter how short the wires are
[2023-10-05T21:04:44] KierreKikkeli: what i dont understand is why it does what it does with the brake when the start and center voltages of the throttle dont match up xd
[2023-10-05T21:09:44] Happy Giraffe: Ignore center voltage, you arent using a centered throttle
[2023-10-05T21:10:11] Happy Giraffe: Reset mapping and it automatically does start values
[2023-10-05T21:22:46] KierreKikkeli: <video_file>
[2023-10-05T21:23:17] KierreKikkeli: umm, what should i put on the center voltage then?
[2023-10-05T21:23:24] KierreKikkeli: start value is 0,85
[2023-10-05T21:23:34] KierreKikkeli: and wizard defaults it to 0,01
[2023-10-05T21:23:47] KierreKikkeli: which causes the break handle weirdness
[2023-10-05T21:24:55] KierreKikkeli: ah its off by default it seems
[2023-10-05T21:25:28] KierreKikkeli: but ye, those are the settings it reads while reporting the start point being at 0,85 XD
[2023-10-05T21:25:58] KierreKikkeli: hence manual override needed
[2023-10-05T21:27:06] Happy Giraffe: Ignore
[2023-10-05T21:27:20] KierreKikkeli: pressing reset it still wants the center to be whatever for whatever reason even tho its ignored
[2023-10-05T21:27:40] Happy Giraffe: Just use mobile app, its easier
[2023-10-05T21:27:53] Happy Giraffe: PC version you gotta turn hardware monitoring on etc
[2023-10-05T21:28:02] KierreKikkeli: naah i find the pc app easier
[2023-10-05T21:28:14] KierreKikkeli: god damn drop menus for days on the mobile one
[2023-10-05T21:28:35] Mirono escooters: Any suggestions for soldering irons? Desktop brick ones.
[2023-10-05T21:28:38] Mirono escooters: I want a upgrade
[2023-10-05T21:29:19] KierreKikkeli: XDDDDDDD
[2023-10-05T21:29:30] KierreKikkeli: that was my upgrade from 80w weller
[2023-10-05T21:29:36] Mirono escooters: ü•≤
[2023-10-05T21:29:43] Mirono escooters: A serious upgrade, from my 80‚Ç¨ dock one
[2023-10-05T21:29:49] KierreKikkeli: yes
[2023-10-05T21:30:08] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-10-05T21:30:20] KierreKikkeli: actual high end electrical engineer approved
[2023-10-05T21:30:28] KierreKikkeli: üëç
[2023-10-05T21:30:54] KierreKikkeli: buy and try, its like 6‚Ç¨
[2023-10-05T21:30:58] KierreKikkeli: half free
[2023-10-05T21:31:16] KierreKikkeli: does what the 80w weller couldnt
[2023-10-05T21:31:24] Mirono escooters: Since when is Weller bad
[2023-10-05T21:31:31] KierreKikkeli: apparently always
[2023-10-05T21:31:34] puneDir: I use similar one and its amazing
[2023-10-05T21:31:39] KierreKikkeli: yeah
[2023-10-05T21:31:41] puneDir: why people hates it
[2023-10-05T21:31:44] Mirono escooters: 2 good references you 2 are
[2023-10-05T21:31:47] KierreKikkeli: its cheap XD
[2023-10-05T21:31:52] Mirono escooters: I'd like a physical box one
[2023-10-05T21:31:56] puneDir: i mean its really nice
[2023-10-05T21:32:04] puneDir: i also need smd rework shit
[2023-10-05T21:32:20] KierreKikkeli: the dude who refrenced me one is one of 3 nasa level telescope fixing engineers in the whole world
[2023-10-05T21:32:56] KierreKikkeli: meaning his job is to fly around the world fixing millions-billion dollars electrical shite
[2023-10-05T21:33:30] KierreKikkeli: spend smart not big
[2023-10-05T21:33:35] KierreKikkeli: if it works it works
[2023-10-05T21:33:47] Mirono escooters: And he buys 6‚Ç¨ ali soldering irons
[2023-10-05T21:34:03] Mirono escooters: Where do I sign up?
[2023-10-05T21:34:32] KierreKikkeli: he has bigger ones yes, but doubt the big boy soldering stations he uses would be in ur price range
[2023-10-05T21:34:38] KierreKikkeli: and i know nothing about em xd
[2023-10-05T21:34:44] KierreKikkeli: dunno
[2023-10-05T21:35:14] Mirono escooters: I'm just looking for something mediumüò≠
[2023-10-05T21:35:40] KierreKikkeli: then its that 6‚Ç¨ stick
[2023-10-05T21:36:03] KierreKikkeli: i guess
[2023-10-05T21:36:26] KierreKikkeli: buy one and test it out, as i said, half free
[2023-10-05T21:36:40] KierreKikkeli: and outperforms 80w weller that costs 60-90‚Ç¨
[2023-10-05T21:36:52] KierreKikkeli: heats up to 500c within 15seconds or so
[2023-10-05T21:37:01] Mirono escooters: Pass
[2023-10-05T21:37:13] Mirono escooters: I've got a portable t100
[2023-10-05T21:38:34] KierreKikkeli: thats 230v
[2023-10-05T21:38:42] KierreKikkeli: not 12
[2023-10-05T21:38:52] haku: What does this mean?
[2023-10-05T21:39:03] Mirono escooters: Doesn't matter. Portable battery
[2023-10-05T21:39:10] Mirono escooters: Up your abs overcurrent a tad
[2023-10-05T21:39:18] Mirono escooters: Or active slow abs overcurrent
[2023-10-05T21:39:53] haku: My apologies. What is ABS?
[2023-10-05T21:40:04] Mirono escooters: Go to your motor current tab
[2023-10-05T21:40:41] KierreKikkeli: oh well, u do u, if its good enough for spintend alu pcb soldering and u need something stronger thats fair
[2023-10-05T21:40:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Holed the cellü•≤
[2023-10-05T21:41:44] Mirono escooters: I need alupcb 6awg capabilities
[2023-10-05T21:41:48] Mirono escooters: Noooo
[2023-10-05T21:42:00] haku: How thick ia that copper?
[2023-10-05T21:42:01] Mirono escooters: You spotweld copper directly?
[2023-10-05T21:42:35] KierreKikkeli: tbf it could be strong enough XD
[2023-10-05T21:43:15] KierreKikkeli: not strong enough for 10awg i think, or atleast i havent tried
[2023-10-05T21:43:40] Mirono escooters: You know the lower awg number the thicker, right
[2023-10-05T21:43:56] KierreKikkeli: ah, didnt xd
[2023-10-05T21:44:02] Mirono escooters: üòê
[2023-10-05T21:44:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: 0.2
[2023-10-05T21:44:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not spot welder
[2023-10-05T21:44:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs tig
[2023-10-05T21:44:51] haku: Nice. Dont you have to weld it with nickel plated steel?
[2023-10-05T21:45:33] Mirono escooters: Owo
[2023-10-05T21:45:38] Mirono escooters: The Lord himself
[2023-10-05T21:45:51] Happy Giraffe: MIG masterrace, or sticküòÅ
[2023-10-05T21:45:58] Happy Giraffe: Mig pulse aluü•µ
[2023-10-05T21:46:13] haku: Pardon me my lord. But how does a tig not blast holes in it?
[2023-10-05T21:46:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs more difficult to weld than spot
[2023-10-05T21:46:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: But it‚Äôs stronger welding
[2023-10-05T21:46:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: Set current to very low like 20/30A , and many machines has pulse function
[2023-10-05T21:47:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: Or just time the pulse with arduino (u have modify the the welder)
[2023-10-05T21:47:35] haku: Thank you sir. I need this skill.
[2023-10-05T21:48:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: U need argon as well
[2023-10-05T21:48:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Otherwise you just weld it with spot welder, or there‚Äôs no advantage
[2023-10-05T21:48:25] Mirono escooters: Sandwich is easier xd
[2023-10-05T21:49:48] haku: Aside from kweld with caps what other spot welders can do sandwich .2 copper?
[2023-10-05T21:50:13] Mirono escooters: None afaik
[2023-10-05T21:50:21] Mirono escooters: Malectrics isn't powerful enough
[2023-10-05T21:50:26] haku: I see.
[2023-10-05T21:52:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs powerful enough
[2023-10-05T21:53:01] Mirono escooters: Sandwich 0.2mm copper???
[2023-10-05T21:53:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_10097@05-10-2023_21-53-02.jpg>
[2023-10-05T21:53:32] KierreKikkeli: may i ask what current max do i setup for the field weakening with my 20A bms 12s, 20a? or should i not even bother?
[2023-10-05T21:53:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, battery does more
[2023-10-05T21:53:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: I have as well another spot welder that can weld copper directly
[2023-10-05T21:53:48] haku: Thats amazing how thick is the copper and nickel?
[2023-10-05T21:53:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_10099@05-10-2023_21-53-58.jpg>
[2023-10-05T21:54:47] puneDir: any good cheap spotwelders?
[2023-10-05T21:55:54] puneDir: im just gonna weld nickel
[2023-10-05T21:57:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ho appena trovato questo fantastico articolo su AliExpress. Dai un'occhiata! 14,22‚Ç¨ 65ÔºÖ Off | 99 Gears 8V-24V Spot Welder Kit Digital Power regolabile Spot Welding Pen Control Board foglio di nichel per batteria al litio 18650 https://a.aliexpress.com/_EGNvTyP
[2023-10-05T21:57:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: This one best cheap welder
[2023-10-05T21:57:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: But u need good battery as well
[2023-10-05T21:57:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ask to @Simone_19 , he made it
[2023-10-05T21:59:47] Mirono escooters: 20‚Ç¨ welder, 100‚Ç¨ batt xD
[2023-10-05T21:59:55] Mirono escooters: I did use such a cheap one looong. Till I upgraded to kweld
[2023-10-05T21:59:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes that‚Äôs the problem
[2023-10-05T22:00:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: You can get cheap welder as well but not cheap battery Xd
[2023-10-05T22:00:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Or u can just weld this
[2023-10-05T22:01:40] puneDir: which spec battery i need
[2023-10-05T22:02:06] puneDir: im ordering the thing
[2023-10-05T22:02:51] NetworkDir: High discharge current
[2023-10-05T22:03:07] puneDir: I can borrow from dads car
[2023-10-05T22:03:16] NetworkDir: Lol
[2023-10-05T22:04:20] puneDir: btw can i use car battery for it?
[2023-10-05T22:04:27] puneDir: 12v 90ah
[2023-10-05T22:05:27] Gabe Enzo: not enough volts
[2023-10-05T22:05:33] Gabe Enzo: need 36
[2023-10-05T22:05:33] KierreKikkeli: doubt it, they can barely charge a phone
[2023-10-05T22:05:51] KierreKikkeli: or power 12w speakers
[2023-10-05T22:06:04] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_10101@05-10-2023_22-06-04.jpg>
[2023-10-05T22:06:07] KierreKikkeli: even when parallel
[2023-10-05T22:06:36] NetworkDir: 12V 90Ah must fine
[2023-10-05T22:06:40] KierreKikkeli: vehicle batteries are a bad power source in general for anything other than ignition and lights
[2023-10-05T22:07:31] puneDir: 3 looks fine
[2023-10-05T22:07:33] haku: I think there are truck and boat batteries that can deliver the amps
[2023-10-05T22:07:50] KierreKikkeli: and weigh 50-100 kg XD
[2023-10-05T22:07:56] haku: Lol
[2023-10-05T22:08:37] puneDir: aircraft battery
[2023-10-05T22:08:51] KierreKikkeli: built general charger battery banks and speaker seats with car batteries for a few years for a weeklong metal festival with friend
[2023-10-05T22:09:24] NetworkDir: If your bak cells shit you can make 3s30p for this. Lmfao
[2023-10-05T22:09:26] KierreKikkeli: they are in fact bad power sources for their portability, but u can charge your cellphone like 50 times from em, slowly but surely
[2023-10-05T22:09:38] puneDir: true lol
[2023-10-05T22:10:09] NetworkDir: Actually for external battery not bad im try to make 14s7p
[2023-10-05T22:10:22] NetworkDir: And totally 52V 40Ah
[2023-10-05T22:10:43] NetworkDir: 14s18p
[2023-10-05T22:12:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: U need A, not Ah
[2023-10-05T22:12:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: And u need at least 800A for good 0.15 nickel welding
[2023-10-05T22:13:07] NetworkDir: With 18650 normal cells this current impossible
[2023-10-05T22:13:22] NetworkDir: Or 3s100p
[2023-10-05T22:13:24] NetworkDir: <sticker>
[2023-10-05T22:13:42] KierreKikkeli: even if high A like 330A still useless coz acid battery or gel battery instead of li ion
[2023-10-05T22:13:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs possible
[2023-10-05T22:14:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: Short circuit current is different than nominal discharging current
[2023-10-05T22:14:20] KierreKikkeli: their literal purpose is to start the car until the alternator is doing the electricity supplying
[2023-10-05T22:14:25] NetworkDir: Hmm
[2023-10-05T22:14:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: A simple 18650 can deliver more than 100A in short circuit
[2023-10-05T22:14:45] KierreKikkeli: and die XD
[2023-10-05T22:15:05] KierreKikkeli: or explode
[2023-10-05T22:15:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: Nope, the pulse is less than 100ms
[2023-10-05T22:15:24] NetworkDir: With this data 3s12p should fine
[2023-10-05T22:15:28] NetworkDir: But bms problem
[2023-10-05T22:15:34] NetworkDir: Multi bms or without bms
[2023-10-05T22:15:49] KierreKikkeli: thats how mechanical high A 18650 e cigs explode
[2023-10-05T22:15:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: Bms with spot welder?üòÇüòÇ
[2023-10-05T22:16:21] KierreKikkeli: 40A 18650 cell being pushed without safety circuit over capabilities go boom
[2023-10-05T22:16:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs useful like anal plug during sex
[2023-10-05T22:19:28] puneDir: <photos/photo_10102@05-10-2023_22-19-28.jpg>
[2023-10-05T22:19:36] puneDir: @Mirono_escooters LESSS GOOOO
[2023-10-05T22:19:41] puneDir: time to build c4
[2023-10-05T22:19:57] Happy Giraffe: If you have 12v home powerwall from LifePo then just get it from thereüòÇ
[2023-10-05T22:19:58] NetworkDir: Your home coming soon at fire
[2023-10-05T22:19:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: U ordered one worse than the one I suggest
[2023-10-05T22:20:11] puneDir: it was 100 lira cheaper
[2023-10-05T22:20:15] puneDir: is that one fine?
[2023-10-05T22:20:27] puneDir: i mean at least usable maybe
[2023-10-05T22:21:01] NetworkDir: Best way to dont die and fires cancel order
[2023-10-05T22:21:07] puneDir: No
[2023-10-05T22:21:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ahahahah
[2023-10-05T22:21:18] puneDir: Is there a website that shows layouts
[2023-10-05T22:21:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: 14‚Ç¨ is expensive ?üòÇ
[2023-10-05T22:21:29] puneDir: yes
[2023-10-05T22:21:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: U wanna against cheaper shit
[2023-10-05T22:21:34] KierreKikkeli: <animation>
[2023-10-05T22:21:46] puneDir: Not but tax is like 1.2 x more on that
[2023-10-05T22:21:47] NetworkDir: <animation>
[2023-10-05T22:22:00] KierreKikkeli: <animation>
[2023-10-05T22:22:48] Gabe Enzo: No. Only for a few consecutive times until an internal explosion occurs.
[2023-10-05T22:22:54] Gabe Enzo: Just cause it works once doesn't mean anything
[2023-10-05T22:23:07] KierreKikkeli: not necessarily even once
[2023-10-05T22:23:13] KierreKikkeli: can say boom the first try
[2023-10-05T22:23:21] NetworkDir: <video_file>
[2023-10-05T22:23:26] NetworkDir: Just remember this video
[2023-10-05T22:23:49] Gabe Enzo: my fully charged lipos didn't make an explosion near that
[2023-10-05T22:23:50] Gabe Enzo: wtf
[2023-10-05T22:23:55] puneDir: lol
[2023-10-05T22:24:01] KierreKikkeli: more like
[2023-10-05T22:24:02] KierreKikkeli: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M08jxf80Pb8
[2023-10-05T22:24:06] puneDir: i have the same cell that you exploded
[2023-10-05T22:24:25] Gabe Enzo: could've just taken it out
[2023-10-05T22:24:27] Gabe Enzo: LOL
[2023-10-05T22:24:31] Gabe Enzo: I swear
[2023-10-05T22:24:36] Gabe Enzo: üóø
[2023-10-05T22:24:40] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_10103@05-10-2023_22-24-40.jpg>
[2023-10-05T22:24:44] puneDir: Skill issue
[2023-10-05T22:24:44] NetworkDir: Terrorists can use Chinese cells
[2023-10-05T22:24:51] KierreKikkeli: theres rarely time for it XD
[2023-10-05T22:24:54] Gabe Enzo: Skill issue.
[2023-10-05T22:25:08] Mirono escooters: Oh boy, we are again very on vesc subject
[2023-10-05T22:25:18] Gabe Enzo: Yes. Much vesc
[2023-10-05T22:25:22] Gabe Enzo: Doge
[2023-10-05T22:25:48] KierreKikkeli: tldr li ions can explode very angerily and fast under over charged load
[2023-10-05T22:26:28] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2023-10-05T22:26:46] Gabe Enzo: by the looks of it it seems lithium ion is more volatile than lipo
[2023-10-05T22:27:00] Gabe Enzo: lipo just smokes
[2023-10-05T22:27:02] KierreKikkeli: ye
[2023-10-05T22:27:18] haku: Yes. I remember this back in the day. This explosion happens because vape companies lie about the batteries and vapers push the limit on mech mods.
[2023-10-05T22:27:38] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2023-10-05T22:27:42] Gabe Enzo: this fully charged Lipo 200a 5000mah x3
[2023-10-05T22:27:43] KierreKikkeli: more like dumb ass kids use random batteries on mechanical mods with sub ohm coils
[2023-10-05T22:28:12] haku: Or fake sony vtc
[2023-10-05T22:28:42] KierreKikkeli: "look at these old laptop batteries that can push my 0,05ohm mech build"
[2023-10-05T22:28:43] Gabe Enzo: when I made vapes as a kid I always put 18650 into evos
[2023-10-05T22:28:50] Gabe Enzo: cause I was SMART
[2023-10-05T22:28:54] KierreKikkeli: 0,1seconds later =
[2023-10-05T22:28:55] Gabe Enzo: And knew the smaller the coil the safer
[2023-10-05T22:29:13] Gabe Enzo: cos less material to heat
[2023-10-05T22:29:17] KierreKikkeli: not necessarily
[2023-10-05T22:29:38] Gabe Enzo: I knew Evo coils won't take more than 10w üòÇ
[2023-10-05T22:30:03] KierreKikkeli: i just calulated my ohms
[2023-10-05T22:30:08] KierreKikkeli: like a smart boi
[2023-10-05T22:30:12] KierreKikkeli: and used nano dragons
[2023-10-05T22:30:23] Gabe Enzo: i only learned how to calculate ohms last week
[2023-10-05T22:30:24] Gabe Enzo: Lmfao
[2023-10-05T22:30:29] Gabe Enzo: cause I never needed to know
[2023-10-05T22:30:34] Gabe Enzo: only watts I need to know
[2023-10-05T22:30:46] Gabe Enzo: and ohm rating for resistors that fail üóø
[2023-10-05T22:31:00] KierreKikkeli: calculators on the internet have been a thing since for ever
[2023-10-05T22:31:01] Gabe Enzo: on my pcbs
[2023-10-05T22:31:42] KierreKikkeli: coils like these can go very south very fast xd
[2023-10-05T22:33:16] KierreKikkeli: or these
[2023-10-05T22:33:27] KierreKikkeli: wrong battery and both go boom
[2023-10-05T22:34:09] KierreKikkeli: almost had one explode on my pocket in class but just ran like hell to the bathrooms and threw the red hot metal pipe into the sink with water (removing the battery cap first ofc) had cool burns on my hand afterwards for a while
[2023-10-05T22:36:10] haku: Lol these brings me back in the day. I use to collect mods. Dumb investments lol
[2023-10-05T22:36:57] KierreKikkeli: depends, i still have a caduceus and fuhattan üòè
[2023-10-05T22:37:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: How no? U know right the welding is from short circuit? If you use car battery, lipo, li ion, you always doing short so pushing the maximum current the battery can do
[2023-10-05T22:38:14] KierreKikkeli: yes, "can do" go over that and boom
[2023-10-05T22:38:57] KierreKikkeli: thats why 18650's with safety and no safety exist
[2023-10-05T22:39:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: U know right the lipo is more unsafe than 18650?
[2023-10-05T22:39:24] KierreKikkeli: one can go boom if mishandled other one cuts power off
[2023-10-05T22:39:37] KierreKikkeli: dont know about lipos too much
[2023-10-05T22:40:00] KierreKikkeli: but apparently they smoke first instead of going just boom
[2023-10-05T22:40:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: I very love when people trying explain me things I studied for years üòÇ
[2023-10-05T22:40:32] Mirono escooters: Lol no
[2023-10-05T22:40:39] Mirono escooters: You talk weird again
[2023-10-05T22:40:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: The only reason li ion isn‚Äôt used for spot welding is bad power density than lipo
[2023-10-05T22:40:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: Li-ion is safer than lipo
[2023-10-05T22:41:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: Lifepo4>Li-ion>Lipo
[2023-10-05T22:42:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: I‚Äôve as well BYD blade battery that if you drill it , don‚Äôt explode or smokes
[2023-10-05T22:42:19] KierreKikkeli: i did literally say i dont know about em too much and "apparently smokes" based on earlier convos, but now i know xd, i just know what happens to li ions if u push em too far coz i needed to
[2023-10-05T22:42:51] Mirono escooters: Why say when not sure
[2023-10-05T22:42:55] Mirono escooters: No info > false info
[2023-10-05T22:43:40] KierreKikkeli: thats why i said i dont know and apparently to convey im not sure about other than li ions go boom without much warning
[2023-10-05T22:43:54] puneDir: imma use car battery until i figure out what to use
[2023-10-05T22:44:05] puneDir: also idk about battery layouts
[2023-10-05T22:44:19] puneDir: I should learn and make some practice first before using them
[2023-10-05T22:44:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: I think here @denis_yurev uses li-ion as spot welder battery
[2023-10-05T22:45:39] Mirono escooters: I remember too
[2023-10-05T22:45:42] Mirono escooters: The big batt xd
[2023-10-05T22:46:04] haku: Ive heard a 4s moli pack can deliver it. Im not sure though
[2023-10-05T22:46:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: Even 3s
[2023-10-05T22:47:19] KierreKikkeli: based on my experience with em doubt they can do anything
[2023-10-05T22:48:20] Denis Yurev: I use 3s60p =)
[2023-10-05T22:48:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: 100kg
[2023-10-05T22:48:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: Why not capacitor spot welder
[2023-10-05T22:48:53] KierreKikkeli: XD
[2023-10-05T22:48:55] Denis Yurev: Typical 12V 5000mAh RC batteries get hot
[2023-10-05T22:49:05] Denis Yurev: but you can weld a bit with it
[2023-10-05T22:49:18] Denis Yurev: I don't know, just did this way
[2023-10-05T22:49:30] Denis Yurev: I was not too skilled
[2023-10-05T22:49:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: If u have space then no prob lol
[2023-10-05T22:49:51] puneDir: not even weld 10 cells?
[2023-10-05T22:50:03] Mirono escooters: Capacitor spotwelder needs constant charge tho
[2023-10-05T22:50:06] Mirono escooters: Annoying
[2023-10-05T22:50:34] KierreKikkeli: as stated before the job of a car battery is to ignite and start up lights until the cars motor supplies the power
[2023-10-05T22:50:43] KierreKikkeli: they sure as heck cant power 12w 2A speakers
[2023-10-05T22:50:56] KierreKikkeli: or can but at like -15db
[2023-10-05T22:51:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you‚Äôve small charger yes
[2023-10-05T22:51:02] puneDir: bro car pulls 700a before starting
[2023-10-05T22:51:19] puneDir: if you live in russia you crank for 50 seconds
[2023-10-05T22:51:39] puneDir: btw the battery im talking about is used in 2.0l Diesel
[2023-10-05T22:52:18] Mirono escooters: My lipos give 1700a üíÄ
[2023-10-05T22:52:28] puneDir: Nice
[2023-10-05T22:52:33] puneDir: i dont have any lipo
[2023-10-05T22:52:36] puneDir: wish i had some
[2023-10-05T22:54:13] Happy Giraffe: Sold bike yet?
[2023-10-05T22:54:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: Mine 2200 but kweld don‚Äôt work, because limited to 2000
[2023-10-05T22:54:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: So I sold it
[2023-10-05T22:54:49] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-10-05T22:55:31] KierreKikkeli: what we used gave around 2A at max
[2023-10-05T22:55:43] KierreKikkeli: 1 new 1 old
[2023-10-05T22:55:55] Gabe Enzo: haha having an arsenal of vapes is so dumb but cool
[2023-10-05T22:56:19] haku: üòÇ
[2023-10-05T22:56:20] Gabe Enzo: haha my 5000mah lipo made my corolla start
[2023-10-05T22:56:24] KierreKikkeli: used 12v 2a speakers and 12v 2a car charger to phone charger boards
[2023-10-05T22:56:25] Gabe Enzo: 3s
[2023-10-05T22:56:30] Happy Giraffe: Yep a bigger car surely doesüëç
[2023-10-05T22:57:04] KierreKikkeli: what we were using were from ex mil volvo s70
[2023-10-05T22:58:14] KierreKikkeli: and everything was directly plugged to the batteries
[2023-10-05T22:58:41] KierreKikkeli: if it would have given 700a the speakers would have exploded xd
[2023-10-05T22:59:21] KierreKikkeli: and the early versions of phone wires directly to the + and -
[2023-10-05T22:59:59] puneDir: is there any battery building group
[2023-10-05T23:09:19] Happy Giraffe: You know the load determines how much current is pulledüòÅ
[2023-10-05T23:12:14] KierreKikkeli: yeah, we just plugged the wires directly to the battery and they barely functioned at all, max we could get out of it was like 3-6w 2a
[2023-10-05T23:13:14] KierreKikkeli: even with an amp
[2023-10-05T23:14:11] NetworkDir: Teverun super 7260R uses byd blade cells
[2023-10-05T23:14:22] NetworkDir: Interesting
[2023-10-05T23:17:48] KierreKikkeli: spark plugs and lights barely require any amps in cars
[2023-10-05T23:17:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_10107@05-10-2023_23-17-58.jpg>
[2023-10-05T23:19:57] KierreKikkeli: 750ma at 50 000 volts design doesnt really meet the requirements for speakers or a phone charging
[2023-10-05T23:20:10] haku: Thats very pretty! Im jelly
[2023-10-05T23:20:25] Gabe Enzo: was doing something similar last week and my scissors fell on the terminals.
[2023-10-05T23:20:35] Gabe Enzo: nickel turned into sand bro
[2023-10-05T23:20:43] Gabe Enzo: so funny
[2023-10-05T23:20:54] Gabe Enzo: evaporated
[2023-10-05T23:22:48] Mirono escooters: Add more wire xD
[2023-10-05T23:23:02] Mirono escooters: Das what i did
[2023-10-05T23:26:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, and basically u get less current üòÇ
[2023-10-05T23:26:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: So no difference between using smaller battery
[2023-10-05T23:29:21] Mirono escooters: ü§∑ü§∑

[2023-10-05T23:53:07] NetworkDir: Battery failure? Aging? Over temperature? Even an explosion? Get ready to say goodbye to those questions.
[2023-10-06T00:03:48] KierreKikkeli: am i misunderstanding something or is this actually very bad XD
[2023-10-06T00:04:24] Mirono escooters: Looks like bad translation
[2023-10-06T00:04:30] Mirono escooters: Must mean range
[2023-10-06T00:07:27] Happy Giraffe: Thousands cycles...bro thinking he is LifePo
[2023-10-06T00:10:08] Happy Giraffe: They market as LifePo and are some Li-Ion pouch or what did I miss?

[2023-10-06T00:33:24] Oreo huzky: This normal?
[2023-10-06T00:34:54] NetworkDir: Like wrong config
[2023-10-06T00:35:25] NetworkDir: Check Input config (ADC) also wheel size - poles
[2023-10-06T00:35:52] Oreo huzky: Look at the voltage
[2023-10-06T00:36:22] Oreo huzky: I am not pressing anything and the bms shows 79V
[2023-10-06T00:36:24] NetworkDir: Oh
[2023-10-06T00:36:49] NetworkDir: What voltage input to adc?
[2023-10-06T00:36:50] NetworkDir: 5V?
[2023-10-06T00:36:55] NetworkDir: it's must 3.3V
[2023-10-06T00:36:56] Oreo huzky: 5V
[2023-10-06T00:36:59] NetworkDir: No nooooooooo
[2023-10-06T00:37:06] Oreo huzky: No cl350 is 5v
[2023-10-06T00:37:12] NetworkDir: Sure
[2023-10-06T00:37:15] Oreo huzky: Yes
[2023-10-06T00:37:40] Oreo huzky: It says in manual 5V for throttle
[2023-10-06T00:37:53] NetworkDir: Somethings wrong in your setup or software
[2023-10-06T00:38:27] NetworkDir: The voltage fluctuates greatly and is abnormal
[2023-10-06T00:38:40] Oreo huzky: It was working before and the other vesc shows voltage normally
[2023-10-06T00:38:59] NetworkDir: Did you change the config or cables?
[2023-10-06T00:40:47] Oreo huzky: Yes and before it showed 120V and i have it connected with 20S battery
[2023-10-06T00:41:02] Oreo huzky: No it happened while riding
[2023-10-06T00:41:15] NetworkDir: that is weird
[2023-10-06T00:41:48] Oreo huzky: It suddenly stopped accepting throttle and then I turned it off and on again
[2023-10-06T00:42:06] NetworkDir: :(
[2023-10-06T00:42:27] Oreo huzky: Could it be dead?
[2023-10-06T00:43:21] NetworkDir: It should not be easily dead
[2023-10-06T00:43:34] Oreo huzky: I hope so
[2023-10-06T00:44:04] NetworkDir: You at cl350 or c350?
[2023-10-06T00:44:27] NetworkDir: adc 5v at c350 cl350
[2023-10-06T00:44:44] NetworkDir: And temperature normal?
[2023-10-06T00:45:02] Oreo huzky: Cl
[2023-10-06T00:46:36] Oreo huzky: Ye but look video it has duty 5% while doing nothing
[2023-10-06T00:47:05] NetworkDir: Disconnect throttle and check again
[2023-10-06T00:47:09] NetworkDir: if possible
[2023-10-06T00:47:27] Oreo huzky: And it‚Äôs easy to push so no dead mosfet
[2023-10-06T00:47:45] Oreo huzky: Why would that fix it
[2023-10-06T00:47:57] NetworkDir: idk
[2023-10-06T00:48:09] NetworkDir: check adc voltage input at adc configs
[2023-10-06T00:48:45] NetworkDir: Until now, your speed, duty and voltage values are displayed incorrectly. Check other values and see if it is wrong
[2023-10-06T00:51:09] Oreo huzky: I turned it back on and checked now it shows 0 duty
[2023-10-06T00:51:20] NetworkDir: And voltage?
[2023-10-06T00:51:22] Oreo huzky: The other vesc over can is fine
[2023-10-06T00:51:31] Oreo huzky: Still wrong
[2023-10-06T00:51:43] Oreo huzky: Could it be a loose plug
[2023-10-06T00:51:59] NetworkDir: Or melted plug
[2023-10-06T00:51:59] NetworkDir: lol
[2023-10-06T00:52:29] Oreo huzky: How I was just cruising
[2023-10-06T01:09:36] haku: Join high voltage on discord. Ive learned some from there. Mainly ebike battery builders though but same thing

[2023-10-06T20:28:55] Mirono escooters: Rollerbank
[2023-10-06T20:28:58] Mirono escooters: But they never check
[2023-10-06T20:29:00] Mirono escooters: Only speed
[2023-10-06T20:29:50] haku: I see. Dang thats horrible. What do they do if your fast? Ticket or confiscate?
[2023-10-06T20:30:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well, Europe Strong word
[2023-10-06T20:33:09] haku: Sorry no offense. I meant EU or those countries. Im not to educated on geography

[2023-10-06T20:35:30] haku: I see.
[2023-10-06T20:52:20] Gabe Enzo: 1500‚Ç¨ fine but most cops don't care except road Security cops.
[2023-10-06T20:52:28] Gabe Enzo: AND confiscation
[2023-10-06T20:52:44] Gabe Enzo: In Ireland
[2023-10-06T20:52:47] Gabe Enzo: and UK
[2023-10-06T20:53:47] haku: Ok. 1500 euros pretty steep. Thats plain robbery
[2023-10-06T20:55:10] haku: Im glad cops dont really care much
[2023-10-06T21:01:23] Gabe Enzo: stealing 1500 and 1500 worth of hardware
[2023-10-06T21:01:36] Gabe Enzo: Essentially a robbery of 3000‚Ç¨+
[2023-10-06T21:01:39] Pablo Fernandez: Here is 3500 euros if you go over 25 plus they take the scooter
[2023-10-06T21:01:47] Gabe Enzo: That's more cash then you'd get for robbing a gas station
[2023-10-06T21:01:48] puneDir: <photos/photo_10111@06-10-2023_21-01-48.jpg>
[2023-10-06T21:01:51] Gabe Enzo: or corner store.
[2023-10-06T21:01:54] Gabe Enzo: but they do it legally
[2023-10-06T21:02:04] Gabe Enzo: Fucking hell
[2023-10-06T21:02:29] Gabe Enzo: this is why we need custom hyperscooters brother
[2023-10-06T21:02:35] Gabe Enzo: need to be so nimble to get away in any chase
[2023-10-06T21:02:50] puneDir: you can hit a turkish police with 9k watt xiaomi and they will not care
[2023-10-06T21:04:23] Pablo Fernandez: Here the fine is like going on a walking Road with a unregistered car without license yourself
[2023-10-06T21:04:41] Pablo Fernandez: Because they dont consider It an escooter and treat is as a car over 25kmh
[2023-10-06T21:04:48] haku: Jeez.
[2023-10-06T21:07:29] haku: Here in las vegas aslong as your doing the speed limit your fine. Even kids on surrons tearing up the trails they do not care.
[2023-10-06T21:09:47] haku: Buy in new york and california i hear they are getting stricter
[2023-10-06T21:12:36] Pablo Fernandez: Well in las vegas i Saw last week a Guy killing a biker in a stolen car lol. Crazy city
[2023-10-06T21:14:54] haku: Yea man. Lots of crazy stuff here. Im sure scooter regulations will come eventually just like drones and vapes. Right now its the wild west on pevs
[2023-10-06T21:19:11] Pablo Fernandez: Here in 2027 they Will fully ban one wheels, and only be able to ride -1k watts escooters
[2023-10-06T21:24:00] haku: Alot of time to play around before that happens lol
[2023-10-06T21:31:30] Andrius: Ive been stopped by police multiple times, they kinda sometimes even tracking me, but overall if they dont tag your speed u good
[2023-10-06T22:02:36] Happy Giraffe: Time to run from police thenüòÇ
[2023-10-06T22:35:59] Mirono escooters: We can't read swedish xd

[2023-10-06T23:37:10] Gabe Enzo: that's why I have a sleeper. going around on a giant frame with giant tyres isn't a good look if you get penalties for driving illegal scooters. I usually slow down to 30 on my Xiaomi when police are driving by and I NEVER get stopped.
[2023-10-06T23:43:06] Pablo Fernandez: i mean i run a nami as a daily driver and never got stopped in years, as long as you wear a helmet and dont act stupid they dont usually mess around
[2023-10-07T00:35:13] Pablo Fernandez: haha i think im the oposite they recognize mine and say well lets leave this guy
[2023-10-07T00:35:54] Pablo Fernandez: i got some questions about some basic electric and soldering stuff i could open dm to someone would be apretiated to not flood this chat
[2023-10-07T00:39:35] Gabe Enzo: Should I make an electrical help group or something?
[2023-10-07T00:39:43] Gabe Enzo: I'll invite some cool guys

[2023-10-07T02:31:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs basically useless , just more maintenance
[2023-10-07T02:51:32] haku: I like the suspension and the build quality of the new inmotion scooter. The yellow one
[2023-10-07T02:51:52] haku: Gamechanging to lower it
[2023-10-07T03:41:02] haku: Do you guys know if spintend puts thermal paste on the mosfets of the ubox?
[2023-10-07T03:55:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: They use thermal pad
[2023-10-07T04:16:01] haku: Thanks.
[2023-10-07T05:43:37] haku: Hydraulic suspension will be the next innovation lol. Raise and lower with a click of a button.
[2023-10-07T05:44:38] haku: And maybe vesc can set dampening
[2023-10-07T06:28:38] NetworkDir: Need test ride to feel stability and .. But looks good
[2023-10-07T06:54:52] haku: Freak yea. Got my 1st 12v light mounted and wired to the adc.
[2023-10-07T06:56:14] haku: Just need a tail light, brake light and turn lights
[2023-10-07T07:08:39] haku: Anyone know what antenna is this for?
[2023-10-07T07:11:20] NetworkDir: Bluetooth?

[2023-10-07T17:33:35] NetworkDir: 6.2
[2023-10-07T17:36:01] Jes√∫s: Why?
[2023-10-07T17:37:39] NetworkDir: 6.2 newer and maybe more reliable.
[2023-10-07T17:56:24] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 6.2
[2023-10-07T17:56:36] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: More options of observers

[2023-10-07T18:10:04] Face de Pin Suc√©: 5.3 sometimes work muuuuuuch better than 6.2
[2023-10-07T18:12:38] NetworkDir: This like difference with ubuntu 18 or 20

[2023-10-07T18:14:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: I've been running many many many tests at high power (not playing at 100-200A) and some motors and controllers work much better at 5.3

[2023-10-07T18:22:50] Jes√∫s: I still find it more stable 5.3

[2023-10-07T18:34:55] NetworkDir: Unfortunately not fixed. Still some people think I can't manage ;)
[2023-10-07T18:36:31] NetworkDir: According to reviews and relative to voltage drop. Exactly half of the amount I set is actually given to the motors. Maybe Microbes himself did something like this to make people think that they are much more powerful?
[2023-10-07T18:36:57] NetworkDir: 80A battery current = 40A real battery current
[2023-10-07T18:37:35] NetworkDir: My fuses 40A. At 80A its works normally but in 100A testing the real current 50A and my fuse exploded
[2023-10-07T18:37:48] NetworkDir: Weird

[2023-10-07T19:11:40] puneDir: 40-40
[2023-10-07T19:11:45] puneDir: cuz im poor
[2023-10-07T19:15:03] sombre_enfant: Bruh
[2023-10-07T20:29:05] NetworkDir: Stfu
[2023-10-07T20:29:41] NetworkDir: this means 75100 box flipsky and mks same problem
[2023-10-07T20:36:31] Mirono escooters: Skill issue
[2023-10-07T21:03:58] sombre_enfant: What u advise ?
[2023-10-07T21:07:42] sombre_enfant: I need lisp
[2023-10-07T21:30:32] sombre_enfant: Im lazy to redo the wiring
[2023-10-07T22:00:34] haku: Can the dual ubox really pull 100a per side off the battery? Or thats just marketing? Just curious
[2023-10-07T22:04:45] haku: The black dual ubox v2 100/100
[2023-10-07T22:06:02] haku: Ok. Damn i shouldve consulted you guys 1st before purchasing.
[2023-10-07T22:06:56] haku: A laotie ti30 but im upgrading to 72v
[2023-10-07T22:07:56] haku: Im already having cooling issues at 60v
[2023-10-07T22:08:15] haku: So i put thermal paste and sanded the deck
[2023-10-07T22:08:28] haku: <photos/photo_10116@07-10-2023_22-08-28.jpg>
[2023-10-07T22:09:57] haku: I had non before. I was hitting 80c now i will retest with the thermal paste
[2023-10-07T22:10:44] Dexter: I know PCs, but, whats the ideal/most effective cooling solution possible for a vesc controller J?
[2023-10-07T22:12:12] Dexter: oh ok, so we are not talking about having water/air cooling. just a matter of creating maximum heat dissipation
[2023-10-07T22:12:23] Dexter: through the frame
[2023-10-07T22:13:02] haku: Wich one is the best ubox bang per buck in your opinion?
[2023-10-07T22:13:56] haku: Gotcha. Thanks. Im looking at the 84/200. How does that perform?
[2023-10-07T22:16:42] haku: I mean i will Be replacing sabvoton 72200 for an ebike of possible. Or is the sabvoton better? The ubox on my scooter is my 1st vesc and im really impressed.
[2023-10-07T22:18:15] haku: Ok. The size difference is huge.
[2023-10-07T22:31:20] Happy Giraffe: Great valueüòÇüò≠
[2023-10-07T22:31:57] Happy Giraffe: Not a single word on the ad is correct
[2023-10-07T22:32:12] Happy Giraffe: Maybe electric
[2023-10-07T22:42:04] haku: What bms will connect to vesc tool?
[2023-10-07T22:43:30] haku: I have this ant bms will vesc tool detect it
[2023-10-07T22:43:41] sombre_enfant: No
[2023-10-07T22:43:42] Oreo huzky: No
[2023-10-07T22:43:46] Oreo huzky: Ant bms app
[2023-10-07T22:46:30] haku: Gotcha. What bms can vesc tool detect?
[2023-10-07T22:48:42] haku: I just saw vesc tool has a bms option
[2023-10-07T22:49:01] haku: Just wondering
[2023-10-07T22:49:51] haku: I see. Im just considering options and still learning how to use vesc tool
[2023-10-07T22:51:26] haku: It would be awsome to have 1 app for everything
[2023-10-07T22:53:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: Any bms that vesc detect?
[2023-10-07T22:54:30] Rogerio Figueiredo: Is the only one that works?
[2023-10-07T22:55:05] haku: I see. Thanks
[2023-10-07T23:02:28] Rogerio Figueiredo: Im a developer but Javascript not lisp
[2023-10-07T23:28:44] Happy Giraffe: It should become a thingü§î 20S300A bms programmable through vesc tool and no china crap
[2023-10-07T23:30:28] Happy Giraffe: If it costs 400‚Ç¨ instead of 150‚Ç¨ who cares as its 2000‚Ç¨ battery anyway
[2023-10-07T23:32:14] Rogerio Figueiredo: V√™s is China crap lol
[2023-10-07T23:33:40] Happy Giraffe: Erm no it's created by a Swedish guy and you can buy many different vesc designs
[2023-10-07T23:36:25] Happy Giraffe: Or more importantly all the features including mtpa
[2023-10-07T23:36:36] Happy Giraffe: Not found even in ASI etc controllers!
[2023-10-07T23:42:53] Happy Giraffe: And now that single alu ubox has nfr port I could even use the pas function if I wantedüòÖ
[2023-10-07T23:52:14] Rogerio Figueiredo: I know but is made by Chinese components
[2023-10-07T23:54:05] Rogerio Figueiredo: Yes
[2023-10-07T23:54:11] Rogerio Figueiredo: True
[2023-10-07T23:54:33] Rogerio Figueiredo: I only used flipky and makerbase still a noob here
[2023-10-08T00:14:17] Happy Giraffe: I mean PAS, not torque sensor
[2023-10-08T00:15:32] Happy Giraffe: Lol, other is stupid magnet sensor on/off. Other measures crank/chain torque individually left and right side 1000 times a secondüåö
[2023-10-08T00:15:37] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-10-08T00:17:23] Happy Giraffe: Best would be to combine them both. PAS gives iex. stable 1000w when pedals moving upto X speed. Then input from torque sensor gives 1000 or more watts on top of that if engaged above X voltage output
[2023-10-08T00:17:32] Happy Giraffe: They suck
[2023-10-08T00:18:18] Happy Giraffe: No idea, havent wired my pas
[2023-10-08T00:19:02] Happy Giraffe: Interesting, I would have preferred it to give X percentage of max power on/off
[2023-10-08T00:19:32] Happy Giraffe: Kinda like, if pedals turning = accelerate bike to 35kmh with 1000w or less to maintain 35kmh
[2023-10-08T00:20:57] haku: For spinny owners i have a question. Why does it takes a while for the scooter to boot up and the colors for the spinny correct? Red for go/green for neutral and orange for regen?
[2023-10-08T00:21:54] haku: Spintend is on holiday right now so i cant figure it out
[2023-10-08T00:22:41] Mirono escooters: How long is a while?
[2023-10-08T00:23:08] haku: Like a few seconds
[2023-10-08T00:23:14] haku: I see
[2023-10-08T00:23:43] Mirono escooters: A few seconds is nothing to worry about You cant bypass bootup
[2023-10-08T00:23:52] haku: Ok. Im new to all this. Thanks
[2023-10-08T00:24:57] haku: Gotcha. I thought it would be like other controllers
[2023-10-08T01:17:52] Happy Giraffe: Vesc checks motor on every startup. If you listen closely you hear the tiny whine
[2023-10-08T01:50:39] Happy Giraffe: Dont hate cone tip, easy soldering 10awg to xt90 and 16awg in parallel to 10Awg simultaniously. Small wire aint super good but it only has to transfer 3AüòÅ
[2023-10-08T01:56:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: The welding quality don‚Äôt depends by its look, the welding is suce when the copper touch the connector perfectly, and put it to the end of connector
[2023-10-08T02:15:12] Happy Giraffe: Cable melted right next to connector and formed a hot bond
[2023-10-08T02:15:47] Happy Giraffe: Soldering iron is a Ryobi battery powered 120w. So nice to have no cables
[2023-10-08T05:16:13] haku: Dam vesc cut off my battery i still had 20% i guess they factor in voltage sag. Long walk home. Oh well..
[2023-10-08T05:21:34] haku: I doubt laotie is real 38ah
[2023-10-08T06:16:19] Happy Giraffe: What values you had for cutoff? I allow vesc to pull until 2.7v per cell if I need it in emergency but usually charge from 3.4v already
[2023-10-08T06:20:12] haku: I set it at 52 but wahts wierd is vesc said there is still 20%
[2023-10-08T06:21:20] haku: I dont know why it displayed that it had some juice left. I need a voltmeter
[2023-10-08T06:27:27] haku: 3.25 per cell sorry
[2023-10-08T10:58:32] Face de Pin Suc√©: Wtfffffffff
[2023-10-08T10:59:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: Then buy a Trampa
[2023-10-08T11:13:31] Mirono escooters: Go ez on throttle to get home..
[2023-10-08T11:13:51] Mirono escooters: That got some juice left
[2023-10-08T11:14:02] Mirono escooters: But your batt problably sags like ....
[2023-10-08T11:14:08] Mirono escooters: So
[2023-10-08T14:24:15] Luis Magalhaes: I think it could give the 38ah but it sags a lot if you push it so it will cut.. you tested what is your voltage drop when full throttle ?
[2023-10-08T14:45:18] haku: I dont know how to see iy im vesc tool bit the percentage drops alot. On my stock controller it can go from 63v to 57v i remember
[2023-10-08T14:46:10] Luis Magalhaes: I bet it does like +- 10v sag üòÖ
[2023-10-08T14:47:28] haku: I believe it does in certain circumstances
[2023-10-08T14:48:52] haku: I will set it lower next time.
[2023-10-08T14:49:25] Luis Magalhaes: So if you see 55v when your stop if you push it it will go off instantly, its good yo know your voltage drop so you can manage your throtlle to fully use the battery capacity
[2023-10-08T15:17:50] Mirono escooters: Can confirm, the epoxy putty works for thermal conductivity
[2023-10-08T16:53:21] Martin Kaktits: oil üòè
[2023-10-08T17:26:01] Martin Kaktits: oil cooled shitbox
[2023-10-08T17:50:40] Mirono escooters: Nooo
[2023-10-08T23:19:28] Taschentoster: Evening, small question if you want to operate the vesc Sensorless, what should I pay attention to and what do I have to set?
[2023-10-08T23:34:55] Taschentoster: I have no torque and the engine does not pick up any speed either... It doesn't matter whether I compete or zero-start. At idle, the engine runs at top speed
[2023-10-08T23:40:19] Taschentoster: Ubox 100v100A Single with g30D gen1 Motor None Hall
[2023-10-08T23:43:47] Taschentoster: Thank You. I keep trying
[2023-10-08T23:52:45] Taschentoster: No errors and everything else is standard, only the control and engine setup have been executed and are working. Just stop at idle but not under load.
[2023-10-08T23:55:30] Happy Giraffe: If you dont have hall what do you use? HFI?
[2023-10-09T00:05:46] Taschentoster: Motor With Hall... Its rusty.... Ball Bearing is Fixed must be replaced. And g30D Motor have broke Hallsensor.
[2023-10-09T00:06:42] Taschentoster: Yes
[2023-10-09T00:08:43] Taschentoster: I got this engine as a gift when I bought it. I hope to repair it again.
[2023-10-09T00:14:44] Happy Giraffe: Works ok on scooters as you can easily push it until vesc gets tiny bemfüòÅ
[2023-10-09T00:15:19] Happy Giraffe: On bike bit harderüòÇ
[2023-10-09T00:43:37] Rogerio Figueiredo: That is why I use 22s
[2023-10-09T00:43:44] Rogerio Figueiredo: Because sag in real
[2023-10-09T00:49:46] Luis Magalhaes: It sags any way üòÇ
[2023-10-09T01:16:51] haku: 22s is crazy. How much amps are you drawing from battery?
[2023-10-09T01:17:36] haku: And what vesc can handle that current?
[2023-10-09T01:26:57] Rogerio Figueiredo: The probkyod sag is Lowe tension
[2023-10-09T01:27:18] Rogerio Figueiredo: So if I want 20s I need to put 22s to compensate
[2023-10-09T01:27:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: Cheap makerbase
[2023-10-09T01:27:50] Rogerio Figueiredo: I just need to turn off the eletr√≥nics brakes
[2023-10-09T01:35:03] Luis Magalhaes: Or you have more volts so no need to push the same amps to have the same power
[2023-10-09T01:45:48] haku: Is that right? My understanding is amps=torque and volts=top speed. Correct me if im wrong. Im new to the pev world
[2023-10-09T01:46:39] Luis Magalhaes: P=u.i ( power= voltage x current)
[2023-10-09T01:47:21] haku: I see. Thanks
[2023-10-09T01:47:30] Luis Magalhaes: But your not wrong too
[2023-10-09T01:48:00] Luis Magalhaes: The motors are limited by kv so if you have higher voltage the speed is higher
[2023-10-09T01:48:22] haku: Im gathering info on pev builds. So any information helps.
[2023-10-09T02:40:34] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_10123@09-10-2023_02-40-34.jpg>
[2023-10-09T02:40:55] Happy Giraffe: 2 days soldering and making bike, so satisfying to see it working
[2023-10-09T02:45:49] Happy Giraffe: Also issue where torque sensor output fluctuated is gone. Signal is super stable and smooth. Cant wait to push some ampsüòé
[2023-10-09T08:33:45] Happy Giraffe: I cant believe clicking"pairing done" on mobile app locks me out...I would have thought that vedder knows Im the admin of the vesc by using it and not needing to manually do shit
[2023-10-09T08:43:24] Face de Pin Suc√©: MXUS 3K motor?
[2023-10-09T08:55:58] Happy Giraffe: Yes
[2023-10-09T08:56:15] Happy Giraffe: Fucking vedder thinking end user is engineer, its a mess to take perma pairing off
[2023-10-09T09:34:24] Face de Pin Suc√©: I recognize the values because working on this motor for a customer üòÇ
[2023-10-09T09:34:33] Face de Pin Suc√©: What VESC do you use with it?
[2023-10-09T09:34:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Old spintend single
[2023-10-09T09:45:54] Happy Giraffe: Single ubox alu 80v100
[2023-10-09T09:46:01] Happy Giraffe: New
[2023-10-09T09:46:31] Happy Giraffe: 13S 42A/150A, vesc no cooling and motor without ferro
[2023-10-09T10:51:26] Happy Giraffe: Anybody know some low profile calipers?
[2023-10-09T11:26:23] Happy Giraffe: How pissed I was to ride home and open laptop, then windows bugs out and then have to update vesc tool 6.0-6.2 to fukin take pairing done "false"üòÇ
[2023-10-09T14:47:14] Happy Giraffe: Gotta love temps not being 90¬∞c
[2023-10-09T14:52:18] Happy Giraffe: Havent tried max yet but should be around that without field weakening on 13s. Also I run out of gear, gotta pedal so damn fastüòÇüòÖ I will put some 60T chainring later
[2023-10-09T14:52:48] Happy Giraffe: I was also thinking about a small 20s3p battery from P42A or 45B Or if box could fit 20s4pü§î
[2023-10-09T17:36:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: This also works with 80100 single alu, right ?

[2023-10-09T18:40:45] Jan: Unfortunately one of the worst scooter frames ever
[2023-10-09T18:40:54] Jan: Building on it seems suicide
[2023-10-09T18:43:45] Happy Giraffe: If they only added 2kg of material to it, would be so much betterüòÖ
[2023-10-09T18:55:28] Mirono escooters: Shit scoot
[2023-10-09T19:05:33] Gabe Enzo: Aovo m365 frame better
[2023-10-09T19:07:16] puneDir: wheelies suck
[2023-10-09T19:07:25] puneDir: he done 999 wheelies last week
[2023-10-09T19:07:39] Mirono escooters: ü§¶
[2023-10-09T19:07:45] Mirono escooters: Play stupid games win stupid prices
[2023-10-09T19:08:07] Happy Giraffe: Weak frame with stupid ridingüòÇ
[2023-10-09T19:08:29] Mirono escooters: Atleast he got a vesc now , so its group relevant
[2023-10-09T19:08:34] Happy Giraffe: Atleast bike frame feels good lol
[2023-10-09T19:08:51] Happy Giraffe: Btw you sold bike yet?
[2023-10-09T19:09:09] Mirono escooters: Nop
[2023-10-09T19:09:13] Mirono escooters: Still standing here
[2023-10-09T19:10:07] NetworkDir: üëéüèª
[2023-10-09T19:11:24] Happy Giraffe: Now with the 10kg mxus rear end feels heavyüòÅ
[2023-10-09T19:11:52] Happy Giraffe: Can't imagine how 273 is
[2023-10-09T19:12:03] Mirono escooters: Doesn't feel heavy with enough amps
[2023-10-09T19:12:09] Mirono escooters: It feels good, powerful, reliabl
[2023-10-09T19:12:11] Mirono escooters: The weight helps
[2023-10-09T19:13:25] Happy Giraffe: It's nice for commuting to have heavy bike but I think I wouldn't like offroad with it
[2023-10-09T19:13:31] haku: You put a qs273?
[2023-10-09T19:13:56] Mirono escooters: It's made to off-road lol
[2023-10-09T19:15:27] Happy Giraffe: Yup, that's why a bit contradictory
[2023-10-09T19:15:55] Happy Giraffe: Depends maybe riding style, I wanna go insane and agile on dirtbikes
[2023-10-09T19:16:11] Happy Giraffe: Nope, Mxus 3K. Miro has qs273
[2023-10-09T19:16:44] Mirono escooters: Bwah
[2023-10-09T19:16:48] Mirono escooters: You just haven't ridden it yet
[2023-10-09T19:16:50] Mirono escooters: It feels great
[2023-10-09T19:16:52] haku: Cool.
[2023-10-09T19:17:45] haku: Is it on a bomber frame?
[2023-10-09T19:18:32] Mirono escooters: Yeah
[2023-10-09T19:18:37] Mirono escooters: Selling it tho. No interest anymore
[2023-10-09T19:18:41] Mirono escooters: :(
[2023-10-09T19:18:52] haku: Haha thats awsome.
[2023-10-09T19:19:54] NetworkDir: <animation>
[2023-10-09T19:19:56] haku: I dont know what vesc will match 273.
[2023-10-09T19:20:21] Mirono escooters: Mp2 did pretty well
[2023-10-09T19:20:28] Mirono escooters: But yeah, not full potential
[2023-10-09T19:20:51] haku: Yea. Maybe 205
[2023-10-09T19:21:10] Mirono escooters: Boring
[2023-10-09T19:21:13] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2023-10-09T19:22:15] haku: Yea üòÇ
[2023-10-09T19:23:05] Happy Giraffe: Modded 205 is no jokeüòÅ
[2023-10-09T19:23:22] Happy Giraffe: But I wonder why only make 273 40H...
[2023-10-09T19:23:29] puneDir: nooo
[2023-10-09T19:23:32] Happy Giraffe: Or os there larger magnet version

[2023-10-09T21:14:08] Mirono escooters: Saves weight and comfort
[2023-10-10T08:07:37] Face de Pin Suc√©: Not a escooter but a electric Tmax without seat, actually, reaching only 200Kmh on this is really bad performance to me
[2023-10-10T08:08:00] Simone: I agree
[2023-10-10T08:08:04] Face de Pin Suc√©: And everybody seem amazed by this shit, I'm desesperate
[2023-10-10T08:08:47] Face de Pin Suc√©: Let's build a motorcycle without seat and going 250kmh and say "hey guys we did the fastest escooter"
[2023-10-10T08:08:59] Mirono escooters: Tru
[2023-10-10T08:09:47] Face de Pin Suc√©: Put a CL1400 on it or CC1000 with a huge IPM motor, long transmission, 40S battery and let's go hahaha

[2023-10-10T09:02:07] Gabe Enzo: My brake set didn't come with one, I assumed it would. And I don't think anyone has a spare..
[2023-10-10T09:08:10] Happy Giraffe: This could be just made by welding two steel plates
[2023-10-10T09:08:43] Happy Giraffe: Or even one and using standard-post mount bracket
[2023-10-10T09:11:25] Happy Giraffe: This screwed onto a plate. Plate bolted on fork
[2023-10-10T09:30:21] Mirono escooters: That'll cost you loads
[2023-10-10T09:30:34] Mirono escooters: Should come with the stuff Buy separately or bother monorim
[2023-10-10T09:43:09] Happy Giraffe: Or one steel plate costing 1‚Ç¨ that has 4 holes on itüòÅ
[2023-10-10T10:13:29] sombre_enfant: Take the 5‚Ç¨ dualtron adapter
[2023-10-10T10:21:19] Gabe Enzo: yeah but what if I make it wrong
[2023-10-10T10:21:28] Gabe Enzo: I have no experience
[2023-10-10T10:22:01] Gabe Enzo: I'm looking for that Shimano part. I need to fit a bigger brake caliper on my rear wheel.
[2023-10-10T10:25:28] Gabe Enzo: I bought some brakes and they don't even fit my Xiaomi at all
[2023-10-10T10:25:34] Gabe Enzo: I just assumed it was all the same
[2023-10-10T10:26:18] Gabe Enzo: can't find it.
[2023-10-10T10:30:02] Happy Giraffe: With common sense you will be alright. Its literally 4 holes to a metal plate
[2023-10-10T11:34:31] Gabe Enzo: Guess I'm taking the old welder out haha
[2023-10-10T11:34:42] Gabe Enzo: Bought it 5 years ago never touched it
[2023-10-10T12:33:21] Oliver Eliasson: what tool sould i get for the small connnectors on the ubox? is it jst and what size?
[2023-10-10T12:34:19] Gabe Enzo: @kawaiinekololis does your implementation work with the Xiaomi dashboard modes?
[2023-10-10T12:51:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: sure?
[2023-10-10T13:38:41] Happy Giraffe: Dont even need that. Just get a bike brake mount or even easiest the dualtron adapter what sombre suggested
[2023-10-10T13:56:59] Gabe Enzo: That's incredible üòÇüòÇ Keeping the Xiaomi feel is essential.
[2023-10-10T13:57:06] Gabe Enzo: doesn't get rid of the soul of the scooter

[2023-10-10T16:55:12] Gabe Enzo: if I connect this to an LED then will the light flicker itself?
[2023-10-10T16:56:06] Gabe Enzo: This isn't needed no?
[2023-10-10T16:56:09] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_10139@10-10-2023_16-56-09.jpg>
[2023-10-10T17:01:29] Mirono escooters: No, you need the flicker chip on led
[2023-10-10T17:10:22] Gabe Enzo: ok, it should come with one.
[2023-10-10T17:11:08] Gabe Enzo: so hard to Google shit To do with EVs
[2023-10-10T17:12:58] Gabe Enzo: always crap like this shows up
[2023-10-10T17:13:25] Mirono escooters: If you Google shit like that yes

[2023-10-10T17:20:47] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-10-10T17:21:39] NetworkDir: You can use any 12 volt led. And you can use mosfet or relay for flicker

[2023-10-10T17:38:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: Hello guys, I am facing a weird issue
[2023-10-10T17:38:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: When limiting ERPM to limit speed
[2023-10-10T17:38:27] Mirono escooters: Hoi
[2023-10-10T17:39:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: If I go faster than ERPM set and try to brake (in downhill for example) sometimes ebrake works, sometimes it doesn't
[2023-10-10T17:39:32] Face de Pin Suc√©: <photos/photo_10142@10-10-2023_17-39-32.jpg>
[2023-10-10T17:40:00] Face de Pin Suc√©: White line is braking throttle Blue line is speed Green is battery current
[2023-10-10T17:40:21] Face de Pin Suc√©: You can see 3 times I full brake and nothing happen (no braking current, no speed decrease)
[2023-10-10T17:40:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: somebody has an idea
[2023-10-10T17:40:32] Face de Pin Suc√©: ?
[2023-10-10T18:29:38] francois schempers: never happened to me before
[2023-10-10T18:30:56] Face de Pin Suc√©: You already tried to limit ERPM and going faster than the limit then braking ?
[2023-10-10T18:33:13] francois schempers: I used erpm limit on my old scooter on a start up profile so police can't make it go fast If I get caught
[2023-10-10T18:33:33] Face de Pin Suc√©: Okay
[2023-10-10T18:34:04] francois schempers: I remember some time going downhill with that profile, I didn't notice anything
[2023-10-10T18:34:17] francois schempers: it was with Ubox dual
[2023-10-10T18:34:44] Face de Pin Suc√©: I never tried before to go downhill with erpm limit x)
[2023-10-10T18:34:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: But now I have the problem we can see in the picture
[2023-10-10T18:35:12] francois schempers: and I had only motor brake too ! so if that happened I would have just died xD
[2023-10-10T18:35:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: But we don't know if it comes from SmartDisplay problem or from VESC or parameters
[2023-10-10T18:35:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: I think I have to try without SmartDisplay to know
[2023-10-10T18:35:52] francois schempers: keep us updated ;)
[2023-10-10T18:41:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: Weird, it's 6.2
[2023-10-10T18:41:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: It does same with 5.3 and 6.0
[2023-10-10T18:42:34] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes that's what I'll do tomorrow
[2023-10-10T18:42:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: Now too lazy to make a complete new wiring haha
[2023-10-10T20:36:57] Happy Giraffe: For me when speed limit in km/h profile happens, only throttle didn't work anymore. If only freewheeling it allows for higher speed downhill but if you press throttle the motor wants to show down. Ebrake always worked, I think it's smart display bug or erpm limit bug. What happens if you set limit at profile with km/h?
[2023-10-10T20:38:21] Gabe Enzo: Should I save 25‚Ç¨ and get the flip sky or should I just spend the extra cash and get a spintend Ubox 80100? I am buying as soon as I get my paycheck on Thursday.
[2023-10-10T20:38:34] Gabe Enzo: I am just having trouble deciding.
[2023-10-10T20:39:59] Gabe Enzo: punedir says he has no problems with flipsky, but I hear they are prone to burning?
[2023-10-10T20:58:10] haku: I bought that and its working properly. I just need to make a mount for it.
[2023-10-10T21:01:07] Mirono escooters: Yeah it's good stuff

[2023-10-10T22:16:31] Konstantin: Hot air;) gus xD

[2023-10-11T00:02:45] Gabe Enzo: the Chinese are always vague as hell with that hahs
[2023-10-11T00:55:48] Gabe Enzo: @kawaiinekololis is the stock xiaomi accelerator and brakes compatible with UBOX? Stupid Q probably but just making sure. sorry for weighing your balls down with these questions.
[2023-10-11T00:56:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: sure
[2023-10-11T00:56:24] Gabe Enzo: Okay, so I don't have to buy anything new, that's a relief.

[2023-10-11T01:00:59] Happy Giraffe: <animation>
[2023-10-11T01:24:56] Gabe Enzo: can anyone recommend me a thermal probe for a motor?
[2023-10-11T01:25:32] Gabe Enzo: also vesc has a thermal probe connector ya? so I'll have no issue with vesc dash.
[2023-10-11T01:25:56] Gabe Enzo: Can't wait to join the vesc club :D
[2023-10-11T01:38:52] haku: I wanted to do this aswell. Can you please provide a link to one? I have no idea what it is and what 3950 means.
[2023-10-11T01:40:52] haku: My electronics knowledge is very basic. Just dont connect black and red basic.
[2023-10-11T01:54:27] haku: Gotcha. Thanks
[2023-10-11T01:57:29] haku: Attatching it to the windings do i use high heat epoxy or silicone?
[2023-10-11T02:22:03] haku: Thank you so much. Is it possible to do it with the current hall wires or i have to add another wire? From my understanding you have too solder wire to ground and the other to the vesc temp wire?
[2023-10-11T02:34:02] haku: Awsome. Thanks alot
[2023-10-11T04:09:14] haku: Made a mockup of the phase wires with temp sensor. This will be difficult shoving it on that hole.

[2023-10-11T07:23:34] Thierry: If you have a powerful soldering station with huge tip it is possible but less convenient that previous version. I managed it with 200W station.
[2023-10-11T09:49:18] Mirono escooters: Hot air
[2023-10-11T10:01:44] Gabe Enzo: wtf. that looks like a 300w
[2023-10-11T10:03:20] haku: I know. Im so dissapointed lol
[2023-10-11T10:03:37] Gabe Enzo: the kugoo 500w M4 Motor is actually a 300w Xiaomi motor btw
[2023-10-11T10:03:45] Gabe Enzo: it's just labelled as 500 because the kugoo has 48v
[2023-10-11T10:04:13] Gabe Enzo: companies do shit like this
[2023-10-11T10:04:24] Gabe Enzo: what is it meant to be? 1000?
[2023-10-11T10:04:59] haku: That makes sense. This is labeled 2800 and ive seen this same motor run at 3500. Idk how its possible
[2023-10-11T10:05:04] Mirono escooters: The kugoo motor is 500w
[2023-10-11T10:05:15] Mirono escooters: It's not a 300w Xiaomi motor üò≠üòÇüòÇ
[2023-10-11T10:05:20] Gabe Enzo: @XAP2P says otherwise.
[2023-10-11T10:05:27] Gabe Enzo: same stator and windings

[2023-10-11T10:06:21] francois schempers: from left to right 1000w 500w and 300w
[2023-10-11T10:06:34] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Stator and magnets same in sizes but windings not, because it's 48v in stock
[2023-10-11T10:07:05] Gabe Enzo: do you think it's worth it to rewind a Xiaomi motor? or should I just bin it
[2023-10-11T10:07:10] Gabe Enzo: rewind for 500w.
[2023-10-11T10:07:16] Mirono escooters: Nop
[2023-10-11T10:07:17] Mirono escooters: Not at all
[2023-10-11T10:07:20] haku: I see.
[2023-10-11T10:07:41] Mirono escooters: What a discussion againüòÇ Trustworthy science sources or just nothing
[2023-10-11T10:07:44] Mirono escooters: No info> false info
[2023-10-11T10:07:57] Gabe Enzo: bin it?
[2023-10-11T10:08:44] Gabe Enzo: SpongeBob sad music plays
[2023-10-11T10:08:51] Mirono escooters: üòê
[2023-10-11T10:09:00] Gabe Enzo: I'm taking out the halls
[2023-10-11T10:09:06] haku: What makes a high wattage motor? Windings? Turns? Or size?
[2023-10-11T10:09:11] Gabe Enzo: Windings ye
[2023-10-11T10:09:16] Mirono escooters: Saves a whole 10 cent
[2023-10-11T10:09:21] Mirono escooters: All of em
[2023-10-11T10:09:23] Gabe Enzo: all of those are related
[2023-10-11T10:09:35] haku: I see.
[2023-10-11T10:10:03] haku: Does stronger magnets or more magnets make it better?
[2023-10-11T10:10:33] Mirono escooters: It all depends
[2023-10-11T10:10:37] Mirono escooters: It's not as ez as that xd
[2023-10-11T10:10:49] Gabe Enzo: With electrical, everything is subjective.
[2023-10-11T10:10:51] Gabe Enzo: Loll
[2023-10-11T10:10:53] Mirono escooters: Magnet quality, size, curve
[2023-10-11T10:10:58] haku: Too complex for my smooth brain lol
[2023-10-11T10:11:05] Mirono escooters: Even air gapüò£
[2023-10-11T10:17:01] francois schempers: you can see on the photo I shared the 1000w motor has longer magnet, the 500w has bigger stator than the 300w, there is multiples way a motor can handle more W
[2023-10-11T12:42:23] Happy Giraffe: Can someone smarter explain me these settings?
[2023-10-11T12:42:36] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_10154@11-10-2023_12-42-36.jpg>
[2023-10-11T12:57:32] Jes√∫s: Hello, is it good to activate this?
[2023-10-11T13:08:57] Happy Giraffe: Oh cool
[2023-10-11T13:19:06] Mirono escooters: I'm so confused why slow abs is now bad
[2023-10-11T13:19:47] NetworkDir: What
[2023-10-11T13:20:01] NetworkDir: Lol i see 100x overcurrent error
[2023-10-11T13:21:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's true
[2023-10-11T13:21:07] Mirono escooters: If you want good oempf power?
[2023-10-11T13:21:11] Face de Pin Suc√©: But it's easier to just put slow abs
[2023-10-11T13:21:27] Mirono escooters: What fixes?
[2023-10-11T13:21:45] Face de Pin Suc√©: Because sometimes, fine tuning a motor is A FUCKING PAIN IN THE ASS
[2023-10-11T13:21:58] NetworkDir: ü§°
[2023-10-11T13:22:10] NetworkDir: error_reporting(0);
[2023-10-11T13:34:15] Jes√∫s: OK, well, it stays disconnected, thank you
[2023-10-11T14:44:08] haku: Is that what this is?
[2023-10-11T14:45:52] NetworkDir: Abs overcurrent error ?
[2023-10-11T14:46:37] haku: Yea?
[2023-10-11T14:50:16] NetworkDir: https://t.me/VescHelpGroup/153228
[2023-10-11T14:50:27] NetworkDir: Send your current values
[2023-10-11T14:56:48] haku: I wish i can my vesc is disconnected. Im having some issues that sometimes my throttle disconnects when i change parameters over phone app. I need to redo everhthing.
[2023-10-11T15:56:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Did you saved settings?
[2023-10-11T15:57:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also unsure what you mean throttle disconnect and cant show app values
[2023-10-11T15:58:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What is your absolut max A?
[2023-10-11T16:02:26] Happy Giraffe: Throttle disconnecting is a weird and dangerous issueüòÖ
[2023-10-11T16:08:05] Oreo huzky: Quick question is UU motor also bad?
[2023-10-11T17:06:33] haku: Its so annoying. It only happens when i change some settings like traction control or reduce negative ramping time. I have to do setup input again to set up throttle. Im new to vesc maybe its me doing something stupid
[2023-10-11T17:11:56] haku: At that time that happened it the motor max amps was set at 130, battery at 45a. And regen brake at -5. Sorry i cant connect right now since my stuff is unplugged. Doing a tire change
[2023-10-11T17:13:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: There is current u use and absolut maximum, if lucky just that is low
[2023-10-11T17:14:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But sounds, stuff is not saved Did you press write button or maybe forgot?
[2023-10-11T17:15:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Maybe changed something in input afterwards ü§î best is if you show
[2023-10-11T17:17:44] haku: Yes i always write. But for some weird reason when my throttle disconnects i have to do setup input and setup motors again. So the values change.
[2023-10-11T17:19:03] haku: Next time i set it up i will ask again. Thanks
[2023-10-11T17:19:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: Laotie 5600w?üòÇ
[2023-10-11T17:20:25] haku: More like laotie 500w
[2023-10-11T17:21:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, people think it‚Äôs best motor in the world
[2023-10-11T17:21:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: But it‚Äôs 1200w real
[2023-10-11T17:21:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs a vsett motor fit in 11 inch
[2023-10-11T17:21:49] haku: Yea. It peaks at 3k
[2023-10-11T17:22:30] haku: Is there really a legit 3kw scooter motor?
[2023-10-11T17:24:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2023-10-11T17:25:27] haku: Not the qs motor kind but kick scooter kind right?
[2023-10-11T17:30:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_10157@11-10-2023_17-30-26.jpg>
[2023-10-11T17:30:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: Like this one
[2023-10-11T17:30:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: Now everyone sell it
[2023-10-11T17:31:05] Simone: excellent motor üòú
[2023-10-11T17:31:18] haku: Oh yea! I was looking at that and wondering. Looking at the phase cables it looks powerful
[2023-10-11T17:31:53] Simone: cmon...it's time to use credit card üòÇüòÇ
[2023-10-11T17:32:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: Many people rebrand it as 5000/6000 or 8000 but the real power compared to other e scooter motors should be like 4000w
[2023-10-11T17:32:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: Compared to qs motor maybe 500wüòÇ
[2023-10-11T17:32:17] haku: Lol
[2023-10-11T17:34:07] haku: I was looking at this one. The shipping just kills it for me
[2023-10-11T17:34:54] Simone: This is 60h version...ask to Paolo üòâ
[2023-10-11T17:34:54] Finn: Idk how you wanna cool that sucker
[2023-10-11T17:35:08] Finn: 1500w 60h gets warm af
[2023-10-11T17:35:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Which one?
[2023-10-11T17:35:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: Picture?
[2023-10-11T17:35:31] Finn: From 1zuna
[2023-10-11T17:35:37] Finn: Only dual saves him xd
[2023-10-11T17:35:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: 2000w?
[2023-10-11T17:35:41] Finn: 1500
[2023-10-11T17:35:48] Oreo huzky: @Flfeedzz what about dual and single magnet what are the differences?
[2023-10-11T17:35:55] Finn: I heard it gets really warm
[2023-10-11T17:35:58] Mirono escooters: Rage mechanics?
[2023-10-11T17:36:01] Mirono escooters: Maybe cheaper
[2023-10-11T17:36:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs speed motor, every speed motor in single heats af
[2023-10-11T17:36:39] haku: Maybe after i burn my laotie i will cinsider this lol
[2023-10-11T17:36:41] Mirono escooters: Speed motor in single config is stupid
[2023-10-11T17:36:48] Mirono escooters: Ferrofluid iy
[2023-10-11T17:37:01] Finn: Yeah obv
[2023-10-11T17:38:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: And he not skinny lol
[2023-10-11T17:38:54] Finn: But how does a motor this big stays so cool if you push your 15-20kw with it
[2023-10-11T17:39:03] Finn: Quad motorüòÇ
[2023-10-11T17:39:41] haku: Drill holes and ferrofluid idk
[2023-10-11T17:40:01] Finn: Ferrofluid with holes?
[2023-10-11T17:40:12] Finn: Hm seems like not a good idea
[2023-10-11T17:40:23] Simone: i drain 24kw with 60h 10inch
[2023-10-11T17:40:26] Finn: If you wanna maoe holes then you dont wanna stop the airflow
[2023-10-11T17:40:29] haku: Yea. Its a stupid thought
[2023-10-11T17:41:19] Simone: And 33kw with 70h 11inch üòÅ
[2023-10-11T17:45:43] Oreo huzky: Per motor or between two motors ?
[2023-10-11T17:46:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: 33kw per motor no possible with e scooter motor
[2023-10-11T17:46:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: 20kw even not possible
[2023-10-11T17:48:50] Simone: Two motor... Maybe 30kw its possibile only with LY 90h
[2023-10-11T17:49:44] Gabe Enzo: vesc has BMS emulator ya
[2023-10-11T17:49:52] Mirono escooters: Ya
[2023-10-11T17:50:05] sombre_enfant: Its not a xiaomi ts not needed
[2023-10-11T17:50:21] Mirono escooters: It shows batt % without talking to bms
[2023-10-11T17:50:25] Mirono escooters: That's emulation in my books
[2023-10-11T17:52:00] Oreo huzky: So I was already at the limit with 17kw with uumotor 75mm
[2023-10-11T17:52:37] Simone: <photos/photo_10159@11-10-2023_17-52-37.jpg>
[2023-10-11T17:52:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: You was with both motor
[2023-10-11T17:53:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Vesc only shows info for both motor
[2023-10-11T17:53:57] Oreo huzky: Yes
[2023-10-11T17:53:59] Simone: I think this is the only one capable of managing 30kw
[2023-10-11T17:54:17] Oreo huzky: Magnet length?
[2023-10-11T17:54:23] Simone: 90h
[2023-10-11T17:54:41] Oreo huzky: 22x9?
[2023-10-11T17:55:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: So was 8.5kW per motor
[2023-10-11T17:55:22] Simone: 22√ó3
[2023-10-11T17:55:42] Finn: 22x3?
[2023-10-11T17:56:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: Idk magnet
[2023-10-11T17:56:30] Simone: It's not mine...I only reported information from the person who owns it
[2023-10-11T17:56:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: But the stator size is mostly double of Huameng motor
[2023-10-11T17:56:46] Oreo huzky: Was by accident
[2023-10-11T17:56:53] Oreo huzky: I ment 22x3
[2023-10-11T17:57:05] Oreo huzky: Ye
[2023-10-11T17:57:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Nope, it‚Äôs 40x2
[2023-10-11T17:57:14] Simone: it's 13 inches if I'm not mistaken...it has a stator that is twice the diameter of a standard one üòÇüòÇ
[2023-10-11T17:58:06] Oreo huzky: So low kv ?
[2023-10-11T17:58:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: Huameng does undersized stator because their removable rim design
[2023-10-11T17:58:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: They do more versions
[2023-10-11T18:01:08] Gabe Enzo: i Don't have a smart bms. only 2x 35a bms.
[2023-10-11T18:01:28] Mirono escooters: Smart BMS doesn't matter
[2023-10-11T18:01:42] Mirono escooters: Vesc gives you batt % if you correctly config batt tab in vesc
[2023-10-11T18:01:53] Gabe Enzo: SO I can set 20s then
[2023-10-11T18:01:54] Gabe Enzo: ez
[2023-10-11T18:02:05] Gabe Enzo: I'll also have a voltage meter on my dashboard.
[2023-10-11T18:02:07] Gabe Enzo: It'll be nice.
[2023-10-11T18:02:10] Mirono escooters: Ye
[2023-10-11T18:02:17] Gabe Enzo: I think it's badass looking
[2023-10-11T18:02:21] Gabe Enzo: I need an ampmeter too
[2023-10-11T18:02:30] Mirono escooters: For those currents? Why
[2023-10-11T18:02:38] Mirono escooters: Vesc records amps. Put your phone on dash Fixed
[2023-10-11T18:03:15] Oreo huzky: What‚Äôs kv of this one
[2023-10-11T18:03:23] Mirono escooters: Calculate
[2023-10-11T18:03:26] Gabe Enzo: Style. also I wanna see it go up when I accelerate üòÇüòÇ
[2023-10-11T18:03:37] Gabe Enzo: An analog amp and voltmeter would be cool.
[2023-10-11T18:03:41] Gabe Enzo: the 1960s style
[2023-10-11T18:03:45] Gabe Enzo: Hahaha
[2023-10-11T18:03:46] Mirono escooters: For those currents? Have fun
[2023-10-11T18:03:55] Gabe Enzo: Buy one with 50a max
[2023-10-11T18:04:17] Gabe Enzo: When I blow this Motor im moving to big stuff
[2023-10-11T18:04:27] Gabe Enzo: This 300w is gonna last barely a month
[2023-10-11T18:04:35] Oreo huzky: How
[2023-10-11T18:05:30] Mirono escooters: Kv? Rpm/v
[2023-10-11T18:06:03] Oreo huzky: Yes but how do I calculate it with the windings
[2023-10-11T18:06:22] Oreo huzky: Because he didn‚Äôt state speed
[2023-10-11T18:08:11] Mirono escooters: A
[2023-10-11T18:17:21] Gabe Enzo: You need a slow motion camera to do that.
[2023-10-11T18:20:09] Mirono escooters: Ah yes, vesc cant report rpm anymore
[2023-10-11T18:21:40] Simone: I think it can also be done with the strobe gun used for motorbikes
[2023-10-11T18:44:48] haku: I dont know about you guys but i really like this frame lol
[2023-10-11T18:48:11] haku: It looks ideal if you want high speed 13 inch and tucked
[2023-10-11T18:48:26] Mirono escooters: Looks horrendous imo xd
[2023-10-11T18:48:49] Mirono escooters: I don't like those small motorbiked either. Looks dumb
[2023-10-11T18:48:52] Mirono escooters: But that's personal
[2023-10-11T18:49:31] haku: Ive never seen anything like it lol
[2023-10-11T18:56:04] haku: Thats true but for me if rather be seated at high speeds.
[2023-10-11T18:56:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Probably not to good ,is there a pics with somebody on it
[2023-10-11T18:56:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: ?
[2023-10-11T18:57:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Or size of it ?
[2023-10-11T19:01:38] haku: From the supplier
[2023-10-11T19:02:48] Mirono escooters: It's Problably fun in city
[2023-10-11T19:02:50] Mirono escooters: How much it cost
[2023-10-11T19:03:20] haku: 600+ shipping for the frame. The 72v version is 2500
[2023-10-11T19:04:11] haku: Ill prolly wait a bit for the price to lower
[2023-10-11T19:04:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: Maybe the frame is good
[2023-10-11T19:04:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: But the front fork is almost the same of laotie & co
[2023-10-11T19:05:06] haku: Yea.
[2023-10-11T19:05:23] haku: I like that there is a big battery compartment
[2023-10-11T19:05:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not know as one of best forks
[2023-10-11T19:06:05] haku: Is it prone to cracks?
[2023-10-11T19:08:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not the whole fork, only the part where you fix the motor
[2023-10-11T19:08:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: <animation>
[2023-10-11T19:08:35] haku: Fuck.
[2023-10-11T19:09:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: 3d printed is stronger I think
[2023-10-11T19:09:09] haku: Haha
[2023-10-11T19:09:39] haku: That scares me now
[2023-10-11T19:10:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Now this was cool
[2023-10-11T19:10:26] haku: Need torque arms

[2023-10-11T19:12:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Mmm guy on the right looks tall alsoü§î
[2023-10-11T19:13:51] haku: Btw i got these aliexpress tires. Alot rounder profile. Any of you guys use this?
[2023-10-11T19:13:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: No, just need better material
[2023-10-11T19:14:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: CmtüòÇ

[2023-10-11T19:16:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well ,i am really wondering why they dont make rubber ones in China,i mean pauselli model tires is a plastic manufacturing company basically ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-10-11T19:16:56] Mirono escooters: Look fine actually
[2023-10-11T19:20:26] NetworkDir: Cst good
[2023-10-11T19:24:32] haku: Hopefully they fit
[2023-10-11T19:39:33] Unknown: I swapped from Tire in pic to PMT. Should be about the same profile as mine. Found it more tippy when going straight but hard cornering is better as your on a round edge not sharp like stock.
[2023-10-11T19:39:43] Unknown: What scooter is this for
[2023-10-11T19:46:28] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes my 22x3 need to be used with Dual but the 17x4 on single (@AndyM365 his one) seems alright enough.
[2023-10-11T19:49:27] haku: Laotie ti30
[2023-10-11T19:50:53] haku: I got it off yay
[2023-10-11T19:54:34] Mirono escooters: Doggo verification
[2023-10-11T19:54:40] Mirono escooters: Such a cutie
[2023-10-11T19:55:57] haku: Thanks. High maintenance doggo
[2023-10-11T20:00:39] Gabe Enzo: ""wat are these black rings??"
[2023-10-11T20:00:49] Gabe Enzo: "owner weird"
[2023-10-11T20:00:50] Mirono escooters: Magic

[2023-10-11T20:21:21] Mirono escooters: Was sarcastic

[2023-10-11T20:21:52] Happy Giraffe: I'm feeling too nice today, violence is for another day
[2023-10-11T22:06:08] Gabe Enzo: basically a fiido with 11x3.5
[2023-10-11T22:06:14] Gabe Enzo: frame wise
[2023-10-11T22:07:10] haku: Yea. I think its 13inch wheels
[2023-10-11T22:08:32] haku: I kinda like it. Never seen anything like it. The extreme bull has a weird stance. This one is like a typical seated scooter
[2023-10-11T22:10:24] Gabe Enzo: Good frame for 72v 100ah
[2023-10-11T22:10:27] Gabe Enzo: but that's about it
[2023-10-11T22:10:36] Gabe Enzo: it looks odd.
[2023-10-11T22:36:23] Gabe Enzo: Wiring these would be no issue I think.

[2023-10-11T22:37:24] Gabe Enzo: sadly says only 36-48v support but I can probably just use a step up buck and power it with a 3s 18650.
[2023-10-11T22:37:50] Gabe Enzo: I'm getting 2 of the ones in the first pic. ill mount one at front and one at rear.

[2023-10-11T22:56:15] Gabe Enzo: I want another power source. every wh counts
[2023-10-11T22:56:30] Gabe Enzo: money scarce rn
[2023-10-11T22:56:37] NetworkDir: Little bit light doesn't make sense but ok.

[2023-10-11T22:57:32] NetworkDir: Good for speed but for your age maybe not very good
[2023-10-11T22:58:10] Gabe Enzo: i understand your concern. I wear a Moto helmet and do have some long time practice.
[2023-10-11T22:58:18] Gabe Enzo: Best way to not crash is not get into situations where you can crash

[2023-10-11T23:11:09] Gabe Enzo: Is your card not linked directly with revolut,m
[2023-10-11T23:11:27] Gabe Enzo: you avoid the putting money onto it, if it's already linked.
[2023-10-11T23:11:53] Gabe Enzo: It goes straight from the card.
[2023-10-11T23:12:09] Gabe Enzo: Link your bank with PayPal. don't transfer cash INTO paypal.
[2023-10-11T23:26:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes never use PayPal conversion it sucks
[2023-10-11T23:26:52] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Use the bank transfer option, it should cost you nothing but takes few days.
[2023-10-11T23:27:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Only if you use the fast way it costs.
[2023-10-11T23:38:22] haku: Dang this is harder than ot seems

[2023-10-12T00:05:51] JPPL: Zips tie
[2023-10-12T00:06:56] JPPL: Around tyre, squeeze and tie 4 or 5, it will go in easy, with wash soap on rim edges even better, then cut all zip ties carefully
[2023-10-12T00:11:40] haku: I did try that but my zipties are weak. Need new one
[2023-10-12T00:12:24] haku: Ill try with a vice
[2023-10-12T00:27:36] NetworkDir: I did not see any relevance between these videos and the vesc group Usually, most of us follow these from the news

[2023-10-12T16:38:10] Mirono escooters: Obviously if you go past the structural strength, it will break. And it breaks at the weakest link
[2023-10-12T16:38:16] Mirono escooters: The hole isn't the issue,but the poor quality is

[2023-10-12T18:57:08] Gabe Enzo: I will only be pushing 3kw peak.
[2023-10-12T18:57:14] Gabe Enzo: lmfao
[2023-10-12T18:57:22] Gabe Enzo: What is its purpose?
[2023-10-12T18:57:48] Gabe Enzo: That's dumb asf. why not buy a higher amp controller then?
[2023-10-12T18:58:34] Gabe Enzo: like pushing 10kw in a 5kw ESC??
[2023-10-12T18:58:48] Gabe Enzo: uhh I hope when I get mine you guys can let me know what's best
[2023-10-12T18:59:36] Mirono escooters: I've always had slow abs on, never issue Weird
[2023-10-12T18:59:39] Gabe Enzo: Ooo thats Bad. that's like powering an AC with square wave. very very noisy
[2023-10-12T18:59:47] Gabe Enzo: haha
[2023-10-12T18:59:53] Gabe Enzo: therefore not sine wave

[2023-10-12T19:02:44] Gabe Enzo: Should be very nice indeed
[2023-10-12T19:03:46] Gabe Enzo: When you weld, are you ever worried it won't hold?
[2023-10-12T19:05:08] Gabe Enzo: do you use TIG?
[2023-10-12T19:22:21] puneDir: Idk
[2023-10-12T19:47:31] Happy Giraffe: MIG/MAG, nope. My welds will holdüòÅ

[2023-10-12T19:49:31] Mirono escooters: You can spot a good/bad weld
[2023-10-12T19:50:38] Happy Giraffe: These lines tell it was done evenly so no stressed points or weakspots
[2023-10-12T19:55:40] Gabe Enzo: I bought a welder with the rod type mechanism. It probably can't weld that good.
[2023-10-12T19:56:03] Gabe Enzo: I just searched up MIG and wow that is a beautiful process.
[2023-10-12T19:56:20] Mirono escooters: You mean baguette?
[2023-10-12T19:56:26] Mirono escooters: Mma
[2023-10-12T19:57:16] Gabe Enzo: Stick welder.
[2023-10-12T19:57:50] Gabe Enzo: Where do you guys even get scrap metal from? buying metal tubes would cost more than just buying a frame
[2023-10-12T19:57:54] Mirono escooters: Lol, it can weld perfectly
[2023-10-12T19:57:59] Mirono escooters: It's the user who has to know how to weld
[2023-10-12T19:58:03] Mirono escooters: I'm a proud stick welder :)
[2023-10-12T19:58:24] Mirono escooters: University, workshops, iron man

[2023-10-12T19:59:33] Gabe Enzo: good idea tbh
[2023-10-12T19:59:51] Mirono escooters: Yeah
[2023-10-12T20:00:01] Mirono escooters: Just ask your welding teacher, practice metal
[2023-10-12T20:00:10] Mirono escooters: I got a box of like 5kg for nothing. Perfect material
[2023-10-12T20:00:11] Gabe Enzo: Ill have to order a taxi to pick up that shit for me kek
[2023-10-12T20:00:28] Mirono escooters: Teachers usually nice if u wanna learn
[2023-10-12T20:04:22] Gabor Aron: Hello! Already have 6.0.2 100/250FW?
[2023-10-12T20:09:41] haku: An old small gas dirtbike would be cool to convert
[2023-10-12T20:10:47] Unknown: The Kellys asked too much current from the battery...
[2023-10-12T20:12:24] Mirono escooters: How? That seems more like a badly build battery
[2023-10-12T20:12:33] Mirono escooters: Why have the current all go over that tiiny strip..üòÇ
[2023-10-12T20:16:16] Unknown: I wonder that too...
[2023-10-12T20:16:58] Unknown: Yes unfortunately... I was about to go boom
[2023-10-12T20:17:11] Mirono escooters: Shitty design
[2023-10-12T20:29:44] Gabe Enzo: Gasbike frame too heavy
[2023-10-12T20:30:01] Gabe Enzo: I mean you could.
[2023-10-12T20:30:17] Gabe Enzo: I don't think they were made for this much power tho.
[2023-10-12T20:30:20] Gabe Enzo: definitely not..
[2023-10-12T20:31:25] Mirono escooters: Gas bike frames are perfectly fine
[2023-10-12T20:31:28] Mirono escooters: Very handy frames
[2023-10-12T20:44:33] Gabe Enzo: That would be a true EV conversion üëÄüëÄ
[2023-10-12T20:46:40] Mirono escooters: Haven't seen my moped?
[2023-10-12T20:46:51] Mirono escooters: It's been ages till I took pictures tho.. I'll show a old one

[2023-10-12T20:52:25] Mirono escooters: I'll take some pics how it's now. Mostly aesthetics
[2023-10-12T20:52:42] Mirono escooters: People don't notice. It's very fun Heard 2 ppl say to each other Huh, that's a very silent moped
[2023-10-12T20:52:57] Mirono escooters: Gets alot of looks, ppl from that generation dont understand xD
[2023-10-12T21:03:27] haku: Lol. I wish i can find something like that here. I like the vintage look
[2023-10-12T21:06:17] Mirono escooters: Yeah
[2023-10-12T21:06:22] Mirono escooters: I got it from Dad. Old motor was seized
[2023-10-12T21:06:39] Mirono escooters: They are findable but broken, that's rare. The owners always maintain them.
[2023-10-12T21:06:44] Mirono escooters: It's a rare piece of history, per say
[2023-10-12T21:07:00] Mirono escooters: I love puch
[2023-10-12T21:16:05] haku: This one would be cool to replicate for ev conversion
[2023-10-12T21:16:36] haku: Brit ww2 paratrooper motorcycle i think.
[2023-10-12T21:16:50] Mirono escooters: xD that looks fun
[2023-10-12T21:16:58] Mirono escooters: Yeh, the super smol ones
[2023-10-12T21:17:12] haku: Yep
[2023-10-12T21:23:22] Gabe Enzo: We Etards get more looks than anyone. More looks than gastards speeding near civilians on their dirt bikes.
[2023-10-12T21:23:24] Gabe Enzo: Lmao
[2023-10-12T21:23:50] Gabe Enzo: I heard some fucker scream out "that's a fast fucking xiaomi' when I was going on the bike lane going 70 üòÇüòÇ
[2023-10-12T22:12:52] Happy Giraffe: It can but is much harder and rods need to be warm
[2023-10-12T22:14:01] Happy Giraffe: Yeah but police would argue it needs to be licensed, if I build my ownü§îüòÇ
[2023-10-12T22:14:14] Happy Giraffe: Not sure if its better or worse (atleast I can tell them the category is 25kmh scooter seated)üòÇ
[2023-10-12T22:17:05] haku: Thats right! i forgot different laws. Lol
[2023-10-12T22:18:57] üé∏ POSS üèÅ (Crimekillz): ...it should. mine did
[2023-10-12T22:20:15] haku: Those little razor kids electric dirtbike should pass. You can copy that and put qs138
[2023-10-12T22:43:36] Gabe Enzo: Paolo sent me 2x rear and back then I didnt know there was a difference so I just asked for two.
[2023-10-12T22:43:49] Gabe Enzo: not complaining I got them for a good price.
[2023-10-12T23:37:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: You bought it as rear motor adapter, not front brake kit bro üòÖüòÖ
[2023-10-12T23:37:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not same kit
[2023-10-12T23:37:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: And sold it to you as rear motor kit
[2023-10-12T23:37:41] haku: I did not expect this tire to be this round in the edges. I think not ideal for 40+mph.
[2023-10-12T23:37:42] Gabe Enzo: I know I know üòÇ
[2023-10-12T23:38:13] Gabe Enzo: My kugoo had round tyres like that and it wobbled like a fucker.
[2023-10-12T23:38:26] Mirono escooters: Why not? Better curving
[2023-10-12T23:38:43] Gabe Enzo: True but less friction
[2023-10-12T23:38:47] haku: Dam. Ill test it.
[2023-10-12T23:38:55] Mirono escooters: It's better then flat tires
[2023-10-12T23:38:58] Mirono escooters: Look at motorbikes
[2023-10-12T23:39:00] haku: But i mostly stay with traffic
[2023-10-12T23:39:06] Mirono escooters: Way better steering, less friction, noise
[2023-10-12T23:39:14] haku: I see
[2023-10-12T23:39:16] Gabe Enzo: I like flat tyres when I steamroll ngl.
[2023-10-12T23:40:15] Gabe Enzo: is that 11x3?
[2023-10-12T23:40:19] Gabe Enzo: those are fat as f
[2023-10-12T23:40:41] haku: The old one is 95/65/6.5
[2023-10-12T23:40:48] Gabe Enzo: 6.5inch?
[2023-10-12T23:40:49] Gabe Enzo: huh
[2023-10-12T23:40:55] haku: Yea
[2023-10-12T23:40:57] Gabe Enzo: weird Euro terms
[2023-10-12T23:41:03] haku: The rim
[2023-10-12T23:41:08] Gabe Enzo: ahhh
[2023-10-12T23:41:11] Gabe Enzo: I mean tyre width
[2023-10-12T23:41:21] haku: 4 inch i believe
[2023-10-12T23:41:33] haku: Or 95 mm
[2023-10-12T23:41:36] Gabe Enzo: Jeez you must need alot of amps to push that fucker
[2023-10-12T23:41:58] haku: That came in stock on my laotie
[2023-10-12T23:42:05] Gabe Enzo: no matter how big our tyres are, one pothole and we dead
[2023-10-12T23:42:06] Gabe Enzo: Haha
[2023-10-12T23:42:16] haku: Lol. True
[2023-10-12T23:42:43] haku: My vsett only 8.5 inch wheel
[2023-10-12T23:42:53] haku: So tiny
[2023-10-12T23:43:03] Gabe Enzo: I use 10x2 but only for efficiency.
[2023-10-12T23:43:13] Gabe Enzo: need to squeeze out every wh/km i can get
[2023-10-12T23:43:17] heimdler: Think Im gonna be switching to 2.5 soon, recently used FW with SHU and going above 40kph. 10x2.0 tire still okay?
[2023-10-12T23:43:29] Gabe Enzo: You need to mill the rims if you want 2.5
[2023-10-12T23:43:37] Gabe Enzo: or trade for 9.5x2.5
[2023-10-12T23:43:45] Gabe Enzo: tradeoff for less height
[2023-10-12T23:44:06] Gabe Enzo: So much work it's easier to buy a new motor and rim for the rear. which is what I'm doing.
[2023-10-12T23:44:16] haku: Do you guys inflate it to full after seating new tires? Or less psi?
[2023-10-12T23:44:29] Gabe Enzo: around Full.
[2023-10-12T23:44:38] Gabe Enzo: Fulller the more efficient
[2023-10-12T23:44:43] haku: Ok
[2023-10-12T23:44:44] heimdler: 10x2.5 vs 10x2.0 inner diameter not same?
[2023-10-12T23:44:53] Gabe Enzo: There are no 10x2.5x6.1
[2023-10-12T23:44:57] Gabe Enzo: only 10x2.5x6.0
[2023-10-12T23:45:07] Gabe Enzo: There ARE 9.5x2.5x6.1 for xisomi
[2023-10-12T23:45:25] Gabe Enzo: which is why you have to mill off a bit of the metal.
[2023-10-12T23:45:43] Gabe Enzo: forget about it if you don't have access to a turner
[2023-10-12T23:45:50] Gabe Enzo: and if you fuck up you're triple fucked
[2023-10-13T00:06:59] Happy Giraffe: But I want bike-ish frameüòÅ
[2023-10-13T00:07:25] Happy Giraffe: Will see what I come up with. This is just a fun thought for if I have spare time
[2023-10-13T00:21:59] Gabe Enzo: should I even bother getting front brakes for my pro 2 or will the e brake be so good that it won't matter?
[2023-10-13T00:22:32] Gabe Enzo: I'm p sure the 300w can't make nearly as much amps to kill a vesc üòÇ
[2023-10-13T00:22:54] Gabe Enzo: even at 70kmh
[2023-10-13T00:26:23] Gabe Enzo: Gotta buy a brake caliper adapter but shipping is December 11 üòÖ
[2023-10-13T00:29:51] Gabe Enzo: I'll have a brake lever for my motor to use in a near crash situation.
[2023-10-13T00:29:54] Gabe Enzo: for now.
[2023-10-13T00:30:02] Gabe Enzo: I think that's a very smart idea.
[2023-10-13T00:34:11] Happy Giraffe: If electronics fail and you need to brake you dieüòÅ
[2023-10-13T00:34:20] Happy Giraffe: Thats why always decent front brake
[2023-10-13T00:35:30] Happy Giraffe: Tho you gotta learn how to control it not to flip above bars in emergency...seems many people are ignorant and too cocky about their skills and blame the brakes for their stupidnessüòÖ
[2023-10-13T00:36:04] haku: What torque specs on the wheel nut you guys use. I dont see any info anywhere
[2023-10-13T00:37:25] haku: I dont want to overtighten and snap the alumimum
[2023-10-13T00:39:29] haku: Oh well. In china we trust!
[2023-10-13T00:40:17] Happy Giraffe: Use one hand and you be fine
[2023-10-13T00:40:42] Happy Giraffe: Rather use also lock washers and loctite and tiny bit less force
[2023-10-13T01:05:27] Happy Giraffe: Dude didnt ride bicycle as a kid and had daddys car transport everywhereüòÇ
[2023-10-13T01:06:29] haku: Looks smaller than the stock tires. Is 100/55/6.5 still 265mm in vesc tool?
[2023-10-13T01:20:57] Simone: you can also put f1 tires on the laotie...it will always remain a...
[2023-10-13T01:21:00] Simone: <animation>
[2023-10-13T01:43:53] haku: Lol. It will be pimped like no other scooter

[2023-10-13T02:05:41] Yamal: The Aliespress stradale look good, is their rubber soft?
[2023-10-13T02:06:20] haku: I havent rode it yet. But it feels rubbery
[2023-10-13T02:07:38] haku: Why so much hate on laotie in here? Its 700 bucks only. Im not overpaying.
[2023-10-13T02:23:08] Yamal: üëç
[2023-10-13T02:43:48] cihan: Probably because of quality issues.
[2023-10-13T03:57:53] Yamal: Laotie better than xaomi
[2023-10-13T04:04:29] haku: All the same in my opinion. All from china
[2023-10-13T04:04:55] haku: They use similar components
[2023-10-13T04:07:21] Yamal: And the question is, what electric scooter is not manufactured or assembled in China?
[2023-10-13T04:07:59] Yamal: Rion/weped/slack?
[2023-10-13T04:10:33] haku: Yea. Unless diy i guess.

[2023-10-13T17:16:54] Mirono escooters: Prefer li ion pouch for that size anyway
[2023-10-13T17:17:13] Mirono escooters: Still have sum, no project

[2023-10-13T17:31:35] francois schempers: what did you fit in that one ?
[2023-10-13T17:38:15] Mirono escooters: 18s5p 21700 with LLT 100A bms
[2023-10-13T17:38:29] Mirono escooters: Within rails, das is
[2023-10-13T17:38:53] Mirono escooters: For 20s6p I have a file, but no rails, and controller space is virtually no
[2023-10-13T17:38:59] Mirono escooters: And not tested in g2
[2023-10-13T17:40:37] francois schempers: üí™
[2023-10-13T17:45:13] Happy Giraffe: What kind of pouches?
[2023-10-13T17:45:37] Happy Giraffe: Those 50Ah looked nice, tho they could have been 25Ah and 50A still for less size
[2023-10-13T17:45:44] Gabe Enzo: Is anyone selling a pro 2 3.0 controller? or 1.4
[2023-10-13T17:46:10] Gabe Enzo: I fucked 4 eacs when testing my motor
[2023-10-13T17:48:38] sombre_enfant: I can, can even upgrade w shunt resistor and caps

[2023-10-13T18:02:37] Thierry: Could you advise how to do it properly? I'm also not sure if abs is for all vesc over can?
[2023-10-13T18:04:07] francois schempers: don't activate slow abs current, and put an abs current reasonable compared to your Vesc capability and you'll be fine
[2023-10-13T18:05:15] Thierry: So around max vesc hw phase current?
[2023-10-13T18:07:02] francois schempers: Well you can peak above it for short periods of time, but if you want the safest setup yes, what's your Vesc ?
[2023-10-13T18:07:54] Thierry: I have flipsky and spinted
[2023-10-13T18:07:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: Have you noticed that in 6.05 beta they advertise to put absolute at 1.5x the max motor current
[2023-10-13T18:08:26] Thierry: For sure with flipsky it doesn't work without slow activated
[2023-10-13T18:08:38] puneDir: is 75100 enough for 60h motor
[2023-10-13T18:08:39] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's interesting, because, before, Vedder was claiming that abs max should never be more than 15-20% more than max motor current
[2023-10-13T18:09:02] francois schempers: go with spinted then üëå
[2023-10-13T18:09:27] puneDir: anybody?
[2023-10-13T18:09:38] francois schempers: maybe he reworked some code to have more headroom ?
[2023-10-13T18:09:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: You keep asking something you already been answered

[2023-10-13T18:16:21] Thierry: I have spinted on some and flipsky on other
[2023-10-13T18:16:44] Thierry: Since I use vesc, I only fried spinted. After few km
[2023-10-13T18:36:23] Happy Giraffe: Link?
[2023-10-13T18:36:38] Happy Giraffe: Because 1P of these would be already insaneüòÇ
[2023-10-13T18:37:20] Happy Giraffe: Cant wait to ferro and run 10kw through mxus. Let it sit on winter day -20¬∞c core and then give it hell with studded tires on a snowy pathüòÇ
[2023-10-13T18:59:42] Gabe Enzo: do I have to shave the pro 2 frame to fit the vesc?
[2023-10-13T18:59:53] Gabe Enzo: @KierreKikkeli
[2023-10-13T19:05:12] puneDir: U can fit 2 easily
[2023-10-13T19:06:14] Happy Giraffe: You want to bolt it nicely to also have cables secured and not end like my 12v aux port frying whole vescüòÇ
[2023-10-13T19:06:48] haku: Those are the batterys on my model y. Pretty cool imo
[2023-10-13T19:16:45] cihan: You should read comments of Onvo - a rebranded Chinese scooter - users. From my own experience, I used only Navee n65 and Ninebot F2 pro. F2 pro has active balancing BMS and it makes sense to me. Navee chassis seems durable but they say bearings of tires are low quality. I have no idea about f2 pro bearings.
[2023-10-13T19:17:47] cihan: F2 pro also has better quality brand cells, LG 3200 mAh and Navee has no name 2500mAh Chinese cells.
[2023-10-13T19:22:40] haku: Nice. I just bought this scooter for the frame and motor. I will eventually change to molicels and ant bms.
[2023-10-13T19:25:01] haku: I want a battery that i kow wont blow up because i made it and will set parameters
[2023-10-13T19:26:13] Yamal: Does anyone use this controller?
[2023-10-13T19:28:02] francois schempers: are you experienced with battery making ?
[2023-10-13T19:31:56] haku: No to experiences. Ive just spot welded 1 pack before but ill be doing copper nickel spot welds on a kweld this time
[2023-10-13T19:34:50] haku: .2 copper and .15 nickel
[2023-10-13T19:35:06] Mirono escooters: Only have a Alibaba supplier
[2023-10-13T19:35:08] Mirono escooters: Got a datasheet tho
[2023-10-13T19:35:10] haku: If not i will change to .15 copper
[2023-10-13T19:35:29] Mirono escooters: @AJAJ1992 @roscheeee
[2023-10-13T19:36:02] francois schempers: Well there are plenty of experienced and fair priced battery makers here you can just ask, because there are lots of error you can do
[2023-10-13T19:37:39] Jan: Used
[2023-10-13T19:38:11] haku: Thank you but im set on making one.

[2023-10-13T19:39:23] Face de Pin Suc√©: What you use now ?

[2023-10-13T19:41:37] Jan: Direct from battery into DC motor
[2023-10-13T19:41:56] haku: Thank you. It will be a 20s 9p molicel p42 pack with nickel copper and a qs8 connector

[2023-10-13T22:10:07] Jan: Lot of people who experiment do that, cause everything gets immediately copied and you wasted then all the R&D time and money for nothing
[2023-10-13T22:10:39] Jan: I somehow understand @SibClimb for not sharing anything sometimes
[2023-10-13T22:11:03] Jan: Example, invested quite some time into designing a new rear fender and a russian group immediately copied it
[2023-10-13T22:11:17] Jan: Somehow kinda cool that people like it
[2023-10-13T22:11:26] Jan: But somehow i feel like wasting my time then
[2023-10-13T22:11:46] puneDir: Yeah lol
[2023-10-13T22:11:57] haku: Very clean
[2023-10-13T22:12:02] puneDir: And that design is not even symethrical
[2023-10-13T22:12:20] Jan: Yeah the copy has some proportional issues but the intension was clear

[2023-10-14T22:08:53] francois schempers: xiaodash, for newer scooter like max g2 you need to flash their firmware with an stlink before you can tinker with it
[2023-10-14T22:20:52] haku: Anyone balance scootet wheels?
[2023-10-14T22:21:07] haku: Ive never done it. Any advice
[2023-10-14T22:25:15] Mirono escooters: Never had to
[2023-10-14T22:25:21] Mirono escooters: You really notice unbalance?
[2023-10-14T22:26:12] Happy Giraffe: Check tire fit first if you notice some vibrations
[2023-10-14T22:26:49] haku: Its mostly in the stem and deck
[2023-10-14T22:27:18] haku: Yes at high rpm.
[2023-10-14T22:27:53] Happy Giraffe: Run scooter tires on air and look if the surface stays exactly the same or if it wobbles
[2023-10-14T22:28:04] Happy Giraffe: Very common problem on scooters
[2023-10-14T22:28:43] Happy Giraffe: For me also happened only at higher speed
[2023-10-14T22:28:53] haku: Ill do that. I notice it has more vibrations with the new tire
[2023-10-14T22:29:12] Jan: Refit tire

[2023-10-14T23:01:42] Mirono escooters: Problably a unbalanced tire? Or vent? Add maybe weight at other side of vent
[2023-10-14T23:02:15] Rogerio Figueiredo: The one I burn was the allu pcb
[2023-10-14T23:02:35] Rogerio Figueiredo: Now I have to use the box version
[2023-10-14T23:02:48] Rogerio Figueiredo: Until I buy another allu pcb version
[2023-10-14T23:03:10] NetworkDir: alupcb temp very better
[2023-10-14T23:03:21] haku: Yes that might be it. It happens when i freewheel it up in a stand. It gets shakey

[2023-10-15T02:08:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: And performance is just a little bit more in top speed
[2023-10-15T02:08:47] NetworkDir: Top speed doesn't matter
[2023-10-15T02:09:01] NetworkDir: With ubox you can push more currents with good temp

[2023-10-15T02:22:09] Rogerio Figueiredo: But I had like 500km on it no problems
[2023-10-15T02:22:23] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 500km is not that much
[2023-10-15T02:22:36] Rogerio Figueiredo: How mutch do you sell your ubox my friend?

[2023-10-15T02:43:30] NetworkDir: Bad design
[2023-10-15T02:54:29] Rogerio Figueiredo: But where
[2023-10-15T02:54:42] NetworkDir: Mos driverü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
[2023-10-15T02:54:50] Rogerio Figueiredo: I don't find any logic
[2023-10-15T02:55:06] Rogerio Figueiredo: Cheaper 20‚Ç¨ controller don't do that
[2023-10-15T10:10:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Nothing too strange in 22s burning 20s max
[2023-10-15T10:13:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well ,kinda brandless ,but if you leave it in the box ,expect big heat ,since box is a joke category on it
[2023-10-15T10:14:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Nope
[2023-10-15T10:15:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Box version has v1 and v2 also ,if you open box ,easy to tell
[2023-10-15T10:15:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But i am unsure if you can buy v1 still
[2023-10-15T10:18:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Depends on what else you did or is that correct at all
[2023-10-15T10:19:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: This exist on lot scooters coz of different reasons
[2023-10-15T10:22:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Mainly there is no chance coz its not Always just a tire or rim related problem ,like bit fucked Bearings or factory not strait axle
[2023-10-15T10:23:17] puneDir: guys which one should i get Sell my other scooters and get zero 10x or some chinese with 50h Or 2x50h for my 20s dual ninebot
[2023-10-15T10:23:41] puneDir: I could make 120a discharge batteries for that (20s 12p)
[2023-10-15T10:28:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: My question is why do you even cut offüôàüôàüôà
[2023-10-15T10:28:12] Rogerio Figueiredo: Lol I'm now it burned because I pass the max voltage that is normal
[2023-10-15T10:28:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Never happened with us
[2023-10-15T10:29:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: 1400 m kinda zero strees for a heat test
[2023-10-15T10:29:35] Rogerio Figueiredo: I have in the box but with the thermal paste and thermal pad on it
[2023-10-15T10:29:54] Rogerio Figueiredo: I think is the same in the box or without the box
[2023-10-15T10:30:50] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Maybe that's why its cheaper also , coz you leave rest out üòÖ
[2023-10-15T10:31:08] Rogerio Figueiredo: But I will maker a different heat sink and test the diference
[2023-10-15T10:31:19] Rogerio Figueiredo: I don't have mutch faid on it
[2023-10-15T10:44:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Farly not , box shape doesnt let heat transfer, all performs much better without box and mounted on proper piece of alu ,not that small shit what is inside ,than unable to transfer because of stupid design doesnt let you push down properly
[2023-10-15T10:45:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: As you wish
[2023-10-15T10:46:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Properly mounted v1 box flips do 75c like that after 10 minutes uphill like this
[2023-10-15T10:46:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: <photos/photo_10238@15-10-2023_10-46-29.jpg>
[2023-10-15T10:46:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: 25% ish uphill
[2023-10-15T10:47:26] Rogerio Figueiredo: Depend on what I set in term of amps
[2023-10-15T10:47:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But this wont help on e brake problem
[2023-10-15T10:47:36] Rogerio Figueiredo: How do tou mount in xiaomi?
[2023-10-15T10:48:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Similar as dual esc for xiaomis i done
[2023-10-15T10:48:29] Rogerio Figueiredo: I never used eletr√≥nics brakes again on vesc
[2023-10-15T10:48:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Show you the example video
[2023-10-15T10:48:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Problem is spikes above limit
[2023-10-15T10:49:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You can completely dissable ebrake function
[2023-10-15T10:49:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like rs does Always
[2023-10-15T10:51:49] D J: you don't know what's good!! It's good for saving brake pads and also helps charge the battery a little
[2023-10-15T10:52:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Thinking of where the setting is but i am only booting ,no idea for now
[2023-10-15T10:54:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: He would need a bigger vesc to be able to have, he already on voltage limit when battery is charged fully ,so thats where his problems come
[2023-10-15T10:55:49] puneDir: <photos/photo_10239@15-10-2023_10-55-49.jpg>
[2023-10-15T10:55:57] puneDir: Box fits like this

[2023-10-15T12:27:32] Rogerio Figueiredo: It's good to burn the esc
[2023-10-15T12:27:52] Rogerio Figueiredo: When you have room for voltage is nice to have vesc is still dumb
[2023-10-15T12:28:04] Rogerio Figueiredo: Tesla only use a lot of eletric when battery is jot full
[2023-10-15T12:28:19] Rogerio Figueiredo: Vesc need to improve on that
[2023-10-15T12:50:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also huge AMP difference
[2023-10-15T12:51:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Not just sensors
[2023-10-15T12:52:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Cool
[2023-10-15T12:52:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Maybe tesla also uses power up to contollers knowledge üòÖ
[2023-10-15T12:56:09] francois schempers: maybe tesla dimensioned their battery accordingly to the esc capability üòÇ
[2023-10-15T12:59:45] D J: I use e-brakes with regeneration and I've never had any problems...haven't burned any vesc yet and I've already done more than 3000km with vesc controllers.
[2023-10-15T13:04:33] Face de Pin Suc√©: I use exclusively ebrake on my speedway leger, seeing 3200W braking power everyday, no problem
[2023-10-15T13:05:03] Face de Pin Suc√©: The only thing I do is charging my 21S at 86.5V instead of 88V because I start with a downhill x)
[2023-10-15T13:07:02] Mirono escooters: Free energy
[2023-10-15T13:26:54] Unknown: It‚Äôs the way of life bro

[2023-10-15T13:29:11] Face de Pin Suc√©: Our Nami SR-One uses 22S
[2023-10-15T13:29:12] Face de Pin Suc√©: And it uses regen
[2023-10-15T13:29:23] Rogerio Figueiredo: You save in energy and spend on esc
[2023-10-15T13:29:44] Mirono escooters: Lol law abiding citizen I want such a group to ride with. Police wouldn't do anything
[2023-10-15T13:29:48] Mirono escooters: Me on my own here isn't useful
[2023-10-15T13:30:59] Rogerio Figueiredo: Tesla does regeneration seeing your voltage first to not burn

[2023-10-15T14:24:31] puneDir: Lol same
[2023-10-15T14:24:43] puneDir: I charge to 81 instead of 84
[2023-10-15T14:24:46] Happy Giraffe: That's pure sex
[2023-10-15T14:32:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes but it's only because of that downhill, I would prefer charge up to 88V üòÅ
[2023-10-15T15:54:49] Happy Giraffe: Now with ferrofluid same kind of motor temps. 50c aint enough to differentiate them. This time tho start temp was 22c instead of 2cüòÇ
[2023-10-15T15:55:45] Happy Giraffe: When riding with my power levels motor stabilized to 45¬∞c. Only last uphill made it to 55¬∞c and quickly cooled down
[2023-10-15T15:59:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Works good Than
[2023-10-15T16:08:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: it is cold AF
[2023-10-15T16:08:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: haha
[2023-10-15T16:16:05] D J: buy a decent esc that is capable of up to 24/26s and you already have room for regeneration
[2023-10-15T16:16:49] Rogerio Figueiredo: Tu put on xiaomi pro?
[2023-10-15T16:16:58] Rogerio Figueiredo: And the battery I put where?
[2023-10-15T16:25:06] D J: There are people here in the group using 20s on the g30 frame and they make +- 20kw
[2023-10-15T16:25:59] D J: more than enough for that frame
[2023-10-15T16:28:15] Rogerio Figueiredo: I have xiaomi pro with 22s
[2023-10-15T16:28:38] Yamal: You are going to excuse me but I still don't understand why you set up all this on Xiaomi
[2023-10-15T16:29:11] Happy Giraffe: YeahüòÅ Will be interesting to leave bike outside in -20¬∞c and then push 250A phaseüòÇ
[2023-10-15T16:30:36] Happy Giraffe: Calculated 20s3p 30T no wrap costs 165‚Ç¨ in cells and then some daly bms would be a cheap battery for 85A currentsü§î
[2023-10-15T16:33:28] Mirono escooters: Yeap
[2023-10-15T16:35:46] puneDir: Fun
[2023-10-15T16:36:17] Happy Giraffe: Then would get the 200A phase I want. 40A batt on 13s only gives 130A phase
[2023-10-15T16:38:41] Happy Giraffe: Haha, need then better for same money
[2023-10-15T16:39:20] Happy Giraffe: But let's see, I might also increase budget later and pick p42A cells
[2023-10-15T17:02:13] haku: Powerful lithium is by your area.
[2023-10-15T17:03:36] haku: Im sure they can make a 30s but its going to cost an arm and a leg
[2023-10-15T17:04:06] Mirono escooters: Mp2 can do 30s and is cheap
[2023-10-15T17:05:20] haku: Can he ship to the US?
[2023-10-15T17:05:32] Mirono escooters: Mp2 is a opensource project anyone can build
[2023-10-15T17:05:39] Mirono escooters: Or you find someone to build it for you
[2023-10-15T17:05:47] puneDir: You can build yourself
[2023-10-15T17:06:16] haku: I see. I will build it myself.

[2023-10-15T17:08:10] NetworkDir: Mp2 github
[2023-10-15T17:10:08] haku: Programing i need to learn to code. Lol
[2023-10-15T17:10:47] NetworkDir: No

[2023-10-15T17:11:30] NetworkDir: And ‚Ä¶
[2023-10-15T17:13:19] Mirono escooters: It's ready to take vesc firmware
[2023-10-15T17:13:46] Mirono escooters: Building is not too hard, but you need High power soldering iron Fine soldering skills Patience And a drillpress or similar to mount the to220
[2023-10-15T17:14:24] NetworkDir: Also hestsink
[2023-10-15T17:15:01] NetworkDir: Patience important xD
[2023-10-15T17:16:08] puneDir: for the bom i need kicad right?
[2023-10-15T17:19:53] Mirono escooters: Tf
[2023-10-15T17:20:03] Mirono escooters: No, you can just download it from GitHub?
[2023-10-15T17:20:12] Mirono escooters: Alu is cheap
[2023-10-15T17:20:17] Mirono escooters: 8‚Ç¨ for a heatsink block
[2023-10-15T17:20:29] Mirono escooters: Drilling tapping 18 sucks but eh
[2023-10-15T17:20:34] Mirono escooters: It's what stops me from building more
[2023-10-15T17:21:00] puneDir: wheres is it
[2023-10-15T17:21:04] puneDir: i beg show it to me
[2023-10-15T17:21:28] haku: Damn would be amazing to make one of these.
[2023-10-15T17:22:08] Mirono escooters: Yeah they r great
[2023-10-15T17:22:19] Mirono escooters: I build one, tested on my bomber bike Now got a half one I have to finish someday
[2023-10-15T17:22:37] Mirono escooters: Cheap and powerful. Smol too
[2023-10-15T17:22:37] haku: Nice!
[2023-10-15T17:22:46] Mirono escooters: Just no casing so waterproof is. Uh
[2023-10-15T17:23:08] haku: Smd soldering is tough for me.
[2023-10-15T17:23:15] Mirono escooters: No smd soldering
[2023-10-15T17:23:24] Mirono escooters: Just some pin headers and mosfets
[2023-10-15T17:23:49] haku: Oh okay. Is there a link for the pcb?
[2023-10-15T17:24:50] Mirono escooters: GitHub has all the files you need
[2023-10-15T17:25:00] Mirono escooters: Read through it You have to order on jlcpcb
[2023-10-15T17:25:05] Mirono escooters: It's totally diy
[2023-10-15T17:33:49] Unknown: Not really interested in them. It‚Äôs the same people from litespeed. I love EBMX.
[2023-10-15T17:35:34] haku: I see. I did not know there are sides in new york.
[2023-10-15T17:41:13] Unknown: Not even like that. Litespeed were doing bad business, not constructing batteries properly and as as result were catching on fire. They changed their name and some of the other worker formed powerful lithium.
[2023-10-15T17:41:59] haku: I see. I did not know that. That is awful.
[2023-10-15T17:52:44] Unknown: Yes sir. There were certain people who were affiliated with certain bike groups who were pushing litespeed and now they are pushing powerful lithium & chi batteries. I knew of litespeed years ago when they started making 60v batteries for Luna. I‚Äôve been researching lithium batteries and I‚Äôve had mishaps with batteries & known the safety of a battery been in a hardened steel enclosure. Thus one of the reasons I like EBMX batteries. Chi batteries have just recently started using steel enclosures and a few of these guys claim high performance batteries when they‚Äôre literally just bypassing the bms discharge. So that‚Äôs the reason why I was asking about a battery builder in the group. I can‚Äôt afford to burn my house down
[2023-10-15T17:59:12] Happy Giraffe: Where are you located?

[2023-10-15T19:51:13] haku: But so far just a few bad eggs on aliexpress. Mostly led lights
[2023-10-15T19:51:29] puneDir: whats saturation

[2023-10-15T19:52:24] puneDir: Like a old washing machine

[2023-10-15T21:25:54] Zak: Fking garbage why flipsky. Its not enough power
[2023-10-15T21:26:20] Mirono escooters: Power plenty Bad design yes
[2023-10-15T21:26:32] Mirono escooters: They are actually very price quality good, but sadly cutoff and shit
[2023-10-15T21:27:27] Zak: On those bikes you need 500phase at least

[2023-10-15T21:29:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Interesting one here

[2023-10-15T21:43:07] Unknown: Definitely ask up brother. I‚Äôm always willing to work with the small business owner like myself. Once we go corporate we tend to focus on money and forget about quality.

[2023-10-15T22:45:20] haku: Im thinking of a way to mount this ghetto lights. I wish i had a 3d printer
[2023-10-15T22:47:11] haku: I have no brake lights and turn signals
[2023-10-15T22:50:16] haku: Bro these are the same haters hating on my cheap scoot.
[2023-10-15T22:51:07] haku: Nothing helpful to say but bag on other builds.
[2023-10-15T22:53:20] Mirono escooters: 3d printer defo handy
[2023-10-15T22:54:05] haku: If i had one i would print a spoiler on this badboy.
[2023-10-15T22:57:43] Simone: It's not sarcasm... it's reality üòÖ
[2023-10-15T22:59:14] Simone: the way I see it...everything has to be on the same page
[2023-10-15T22:59:41] Simone: there's no point in mounting an expensive controller on a vehicle that's worth 1/10 to me
[2023-10-15T23:00:23] Mirono escooters: To you
[2023-10-15T23:02:32] Simone: Certain
[2023-10-15T23:04:08] Simone: next time I will mount a Garrett on bearings to a Daewoo Matiz 800cc 3 cylinder
[2023-10-15T23:04:16] Simone: ü´£üòÖüòÇ
[2023-10-15T23:05:25] haku: Why not? I turned an ordinary civic to type r motors b18c back in the day.
[2023-10-15T23:06:33] haku: Imo the chasis doesnt matter. The rgb doesnt matter. Its all about power.
[2023-10-15T23:07:09] Simone: You are talking about a Civic not a tuna can with a brush cutter engine
[2023-10-15T23:07:39] Simone: mine was an example
[2023-10-15T23:07:48] Simone: everything can be done
[2023-10-15T23:07:56] haku: Because thats the same concept. Civics were cheap cars back then 90s
[2023-10-15T23:08:32] Simone: it's not the same concept...you are developing a machine that has potential
[2023-10-15T23:09:17] haku: And we are not? We are pretty much tuning our machines to its full potential
[2023-10-15T23:09:44] Simone: according to your reasoning then it would be enough to buy the engine of a Ferrari and put it in any chassis to have a high-performance car
[2023-10-15T23:09:58] Simone: it does not work like that
[2023-10-15T23:10:07] Mirono escooters: Go discuss somewhere else.
[2023-10-15T23:10:34] haku: Ofcourse you can. This is america its been done here for sure.
[2023-10-15T23:11:42] Simone: It's an exchange of opinions... does it bother you? Move on üôÇ
[2023-10-15T23:12:37] haku: With all due respect. Please keep your negative opinions to yourself and stop shitting on others
[2023-10-15T23:13:21] Simone: You're talking about the same "base". You're not comparing the matiz to an m3 üòÅ
[2023-10-15T23:13:53] Mirono escooters: Oh god, you aren't happy today
[2023-10-15T23:14:06] Simone: Ok. I will say the best seen project in my life if you like ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-10-15T23:14:09] Mirono escooters: It's annoying and totally unfitting with the group
[2023-10-15T23:14:20] Mirono escooters: @jamessoderstrom

[2023-10-15T23:18:24] Mirono escooters: True gentleman
[2023-10-15T23:20:51] Simone: I have no problem with anyone but it seems that if you disagree with some "technical" choices... you're not good and your opinion doesn't count
[2023-10-15T23:23:09] Happy Giraffe: I mean people run vsett motors on xiaomi essentials and 12s batteries. We can say once its not smart/optimal once but lets keep it that. If someone wants to build it regardless then whatever not our issue.

[2023-10-16T00:14:15] NetworkDir: Yeah
[2023-10-16T00:14:19] NetworkDir: Very cool project

[2023-10-16T01:44:56] haku: Its crazy that honda wants a piece of that scooter $$. Whos the first one that will put a vesc on this..
[2023-10-16T01:47:42] haku: üòÇ
[2023-10-16T01:48:37] haku: There will be a market for this.
[2023-10-16T01:50:42] Unknown: Looks like a slice of bread üçû with wheels ü•µno they didn‚Äôt do this ü§ï
[2023-10-16T01:51:10] haku: I will purchase one lol. Says it will be 900 bucks.
[2023-10-16T01:52:10] Unknown: Well holy cow. What‚Äôs the voltage
[2023-10-16T01:52:26] haku: No idea.
[2023-10-16T01:52:56] Unknown: Ok
[2023-10-16T01:53:28] haku: Prolly trying to compete with segway or niu. My guess is 36v
[2023-10-16T01:55:03] Unknown: Segway came to mind when I saw the wheels
[2023-10-16T01:57:30] Unknown: It‚Äôs perfect for cruising around. But man it looks weird. I thought it was a riding suitcase
[2023-10-16T01:58:08] haku: Lol yea.

[2023-10-16T02:25:00] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: ü¶Ä
[2023-10-16T02:51:21] Yamal: How does Mr. Paolo Wu take care of himself
[2023-10-16T07:55:02] heimdler: Are all the electric scooter hall sensor pcb similar?
[2023-10-16T10:41:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Depends on what you mean under similar
[2023-10-16T10:44:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: There are different sizes , the sensor distance is different, also sensors can be much different in work voltage, and some has different middle sensor,there is few versions lets say
[2023-10-16T10:44:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Whats your goal?
[2023-10-16T11:07:40] Oreo huzky: Does anyone has size of dualtron thunder battery bay length x width x depth
[2023-10-16T11:08:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I could only give that, from victor right now
[2023-10-16T11:10:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Btw nice backlogüòÖ
[2023-10-16T11:20:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I am kinda unsure that there was any purpose, kinda like how Happy said. Near all I use to say it's nice to make any build ,since you basically generate knowledge for your self and experience with different stuff ,what you may like or hate ,but you can decide that is something you like or not and you spent nothing while you get paid for it. So basically freelabor what is good, from others money you can predic your own future build. Some project make no sense ,but customer may have the parts already soü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-10-16T12:21:17] heimdler: That's the answer I'm expecting, which means no
[2023-10-16T12:22:47] heimdler: Someone dropped a REID unit where the motor wouldn't run. Motor pcb seems fine with multimeter. Even got a new controller to swap, which then leads me to a faulty throttle
[2023-10-16T12:24:00] heimdler: Put on a spare throttle but still nothing moves... Unfortunately the user got to skip town, assembled the unit back after few days of trouble shooting without spare parts and it was back to square one for them
[2023-10-16T12:26:53] heimdler: Failed to fix the scooter but made a new friend
[2023-10-16T12:36:53] Thierry: What is the difference between app-adc-detach and override?
[2023-10-16T12:37:17] Thierry: Shall I detach to override?
[2023-10-16T14:16:10] Zak: @RohScoThunder bro i like your scooter thing because its stealth and a sleeper. It'll destroy a lot of things and make people smile
[2023-10-16T14:16:30] Santiago: Hi guys, this is a bit off topic but, does anybody do technical drawing and is willing to help me with a few questions?? I just started my CNC milling course
[2023-10-16T14:20:36] Happy Giraffe: I'm myself also starting very soon and wont be much of a help. Which questions you have regarding drawing?
[2023-10-16T14:30:03] Happy Giraffe: I did drawing like this to be the mount of vesc and teacher approved it. Had two unnecessary measures (and missed hole diameter) but otherwise ok. Fusion360 has drawing feature on the top left corner menu.
[2023-10-16T14:39:57] koxx / Francois Deslandes: a major ebrake issue on vesc was solve today (especially with erpm limit) ! youraaah ! you need to use latest 6.05 build from today. sometimes, ebrake didn't brake...
[2023-10-16T14:40:27] Santiago: It's more of a teoric question I think it's better to DM you
[2023-10-16T14:41:41] koxx / Francois Deslandes: code fix posted 2h ago
[2023-10-16T14:42:15] koxx / Francois Deslandes: beta 20
[2023-10-16T14:46:03] Happy Giraffe: And maybe better features, fixing full throttle during brake calibration on vesc mobileüòÇ
[2023-10-16T14:54:24] Happy Giraffe: Yeah it's fucking dangerous full power. Especially if I go 250A phase later with new batt. Bike will just wheelie me offüòÇüòÇüòÇ

[2023-10-16T16:20:45] Yamal: üî•
[2023-10-16T16:21:01] Yamal: Hehe!
[2023-10-16T16:25:34] Yamal: By the way, do you know if they are going to release a new model in the near future or not? because some time ago he talked about something more powerful, but for now nothing is known..
[2023-10-16T16:37:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs you?üòÇ
[2023-10-16T16:46:00] Yamal: Max blinker?
[2023-10-16T19:00:47] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I've just update to FW 6.05. I was on 5.3 before üòÖ now, when I do a full throttle, the motors start on 10cm, then make a full stop and a "BRRRRR". usually, it's a sign for an absolut max current... but here, no error. I've set 120A phase / 200A abs max ... and the issue is still here. and also re-done my detection now that motors are hot. any idea ? I've just changed my observer from mxleming to ortega. I'll see tomorrow if it changes anything. never had such trouble with 5.3. but if I remember correctly, the "slow abs current limit" was set to true by default in 5.3... and now it's false by default. but why no error. it's weird.
[2023-10-16T19:10:22] Konstantin: 6.02 works well.
[2023-10-16T19:25:07] Happy Giraffe: "Human being scanned, propability of it being idiot is 90%" "Use counter measurements, eject...eject...abort mission"üòÇ
[2023-10-16T19:26:33] Happy Giraffe: Mxlemming seems to be very nice on ebike motors but somehow people say its not as good on scooters
[2023-10-16T19:27:16] Happy Giraffe: Saturation error?
[2023-10-16T19:27:29] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what is that ?
[2023-10-16T19:29:36] Happy Giraffe: If your motor is smaller and gets saturated vesc looses track of it. Happened to my smaller ebike motor a lot with 80+phase
[2023-10-16T19:29:59] Happy Giraffe: If you use temperature compensation does it help?ü§î
[2023-10-16T19:30:51] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I am sure it's saturated considering the size (25mm wide ... 130A). but it was not an issue with 5.3 üòÖ
[2023-10-16T19:32:12] Happy Giraffe: For me aswell first it was not and issue even using same firmware 6.02 at 100A phase Then something changed and 90A+ made motor brrrr
[2023-10-16T19:32:43] Happy Giraffe: You can reduce the startup phase current by some % if needed too
[2023-10-16T19:41:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: hummmm ... if it doesn't work after changing the observer, I'll try
[2023-10-16T19:46:22] Gabe Enzo: Spintend is taking ages
[2023-10-16T20:47:57] haku: I think spintend is built to order. When i got mine they were wiring up the throttle i requested and soldering the the throttle to the adc. Shipping was fast though as soon as it was done it took dhl 3 days to deliver it
[2023-10-16T21:33:55] Gabe Enzo: I chose regular Mail post
[2023-10-17T00:37:57] heimdler: Can anyone share the link to buy the right Xiaomi 1S clone BMS?
[2023-10-17T00:39:50] francois schempers: https://e-scooters.embedden.com/shop/smart-bms/happy-bms-for-xiaomi/
[2023-10-17T00:41:01] heimdler: I'm replacing the original 36v 7.8Ah pack, the BMS is faulty
[2023-10-17T00:42:38] francois schempers: this one will do fine, you can even make it higher voltage, the bms will handle it
[2023-10-17T00:42:52] heimdler: Got this but one side of the terminals strip are not in same positions
[2023-10-17T00:43:20] heimdler: And don't have the terminal for the brake lights...
[2023-10-17T00:43:35] francois schempers: you can just solder the wire on each point, it will work fine
[2023-10-17T00:44:01] heimdler: Meaning I can just extend with a wire?
[2023-10-17T00:45:21] heimdler: The cells are still in the original brackets
[2023-10-17T00:45:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Brake lights are basically coming from the contoller ,so you can wire that out for sure
[2023-10-17T00:45:35] heimdler: Ok
[2023-10-17T00:45:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Probably they are for m365 1s rails different i guess
[2023-10-17T00:45:58] francois schempers: <photos/photo_10290@17-10-2023_00-45-58.jpg>
[2023-10-17T00:46:11] francois schempers: here, you can tape into it for the balancing wire
[2023-10-17T00:46:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Denis has simple replacement one
[2023-10-17T00:47:33] heimdler: Yes but it costs 5x more, I'd get it if I'm building bigger pack tho
[2023-10-17T00:48:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And you have all?
[2023-10-17T00:48:12] heimdler: Tape into it? Tape what may I ask?
[2023-10-17T00:48:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: How about replacing whole and wire out brake light
[2023-10-17T00:49:28] francois schempers: Well all your balancing wire, instead off getting them to each cell group, you use the existing rail
[2023-10-17T00:49:42] heimdler: Yeah I'd probably do that, replacing all. Extend with wire for the terminals that's off position and connect the rear brake light directly to esc
[2023-10-17T00:49:42] francois schempers: this is the simple one https://e-scooters.embedden.com/shop/smart-bms/repair-bms-for-xiaomi/
[2023-10-17T00:50:16] francois schempers: and as for a cheaper Aliexpress link I don't have any sorry
[2023-10-17T00:52:33] heimdler: Extend the balancing wires to the terminals like this, eh?
[2023-10-17T00:52:49] francois schempers: I did it once,like this
[2023-10-17T00:53:16] heimdler: Yes, I'd use the existing rails except that they're off positioned. So I'd extend it with a wire to get the points connected
[2023-10-17T00:53:25] francois schempers: <photos/photo_10292@17-10-2023_00-53-25.jpg>
[2023-10-17T00:54:46] francois schempers: ah well that's faster when the rails are still good ^^ I guess you'll have to get to each group ^^
[2023-10-17T00:55:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: His problem is that all old m365 bms claimed to be 1s also ,just buy it üòÖ
[2023-10-17T00:56:24] heimdler: Actually it though the m365 BMS is the same as 1S haha
[2023-10-17T00:56:49] heimdler: Hard to differentiate from picture
[2023-10-17T00:56:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Almost,but as you see there are little differences
[2023-10-17T00:57:15] heimdler: Yes, it's missing two terminal for rear brake
[2023-10-17T00:57:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: That's the easy to make
[2023-10-17T00:57:46] heimdler: And the rail position for one side is slightly shortened
[2023-10-17T00:58:16] heimdler: Why you didn't use the T strip?
[2023-10-17T00:58:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If you can sort the rails , brake light is simple
[2023-10-17T00:58:25] francois schempers: you just have to make a gnd somewhere, like bat - and take the right pin on the controller and you'll make your own rear signal
[2023-10-17T00:58:27] heimdler: Ok I'll do that first
[2023-10-17T00:58:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yep
[2023-10-17T00:58:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But easier to solder all on pcb
[2023-10-17T00:59:25] francois schempers: I was replacing it will a different bms that had a different pinout, so I had to use cables
[2023-10-17T01:00:09] heimdler: Ok, and then the wires goes to the terminals on the brackets?
[2023-10-17T01:02:41] francois schempers: <photos/photo_10293@17-10-2023_01-02-41.jpg>
[2023-10-17T01:03:13] francois schempers: you means this ?
[2023-10-17T01:03:23] francois schempers: <photos/photo_10294@17-10-2023_01-03-23.jpg>
[2023-10-17T01:03:42] heimdler: Yes
[2023-10-17T01:04:15] francois schempers: Well yeah, once you wired it correctly you can just plug it to the bms,double check before though ;)
[2023-10-17T01:05:18] francois schempers: here it is well done, well better than what I did üòÇ
[2023-10-17T01:05:18] francois schempers: <photos/photo_10198@13-10-2023_21-56-46.jpg>

[2023-10-17T01:05:38] heimdler: Heaven and earth üòÇ
[2023-10-17T01:06:11] heimdler: Thanks! I'll share this to the engineer
[2023-10-17T01:08:10] heimdler: Arrived yesterday
[2023-10-17T01:10:39] francois schempers: have a good read, they will teach you all they're is to know about those balancing wire ;)
[2023-10-17T01:18:19] Happy Giraffe: And because someone is an engineer don't trust them blind. If they havent built batteries they are still noobs.
[2023-10-17T01:18:38] Happy Giraffe: Best is to ask some building pictures
[2023-10-17T01:30:06] heimdler: Yes I'm aware, they'd prefer working with something that's built for it than hacking it out because it's not for themselves, so meeting customer expectation is important. This is where they'd ask if I want to proceed, thus im able to check here and figured that it's all pretty logical which picture to help me understand the issue better
[2023-10-17T01:30:48] heimdler: Really appreciate all the help and I will proceed as discussed. Thanks again!
[2023-10-17T01:33:28] francois schempers: Good luck üí™

[2023-10-17T15:36:49] francois schempers: they g2 motor temp sensor is a bit weird, I went full hardcore on it, 50A in a uphill on like 1km, motor feels Barly warm, and a bit hot 10 min after, but nothing too crazy, I could keep my hand on it. and the temps sensor says its 140¬∞c in there x)
[2023-10-17T15:41:27] francois schempers: never had this much variance
[2023-10-17T16:26:11] Happy Giraffe: This, if no ferrofluid the inside can be 150¬∞c and outside 50¬∞cüòÖ
[2023-10-17T16:26:49] Happy Giraffe: If you wait the 4-5mins then outside should start heating slowly but peak heat inside could have already caused damageüòî
[2023-10-17T16:34:47] francois schempers: I still think xiaodash's cfw doesn't read correctly motor temp, I'll open it to see
[2023-10-17T16:54:21] francois schempers: it should start to demagnetize at 80¬∞c and it didn't loose power anything at 140, the temps sensor is definitely reading wrong

[2023-10-17T18:51:04] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But, you did detect with phase filters on?

[2023-10-17T18:52:55] Santiago: I bought mine a few months ago and haven't tested it yet, hopefully it doesn't happen to me tooü•π
[2023-10-17T18:52:56] Mo: It turned off automatically
[2023-10-17T18:53:11] Mo: I removed all the wires
[2023-10-17T18:53:12] Unknown: How are you going to mount the disc? If your hub has threaded holes for the disc then you definitely can.
[2023-10-17T18:53:25] Mirono escooters: It doesnt
[2023-10-17T18:53:50] Mo: When I tried to reconnecting the battery
[2023-10-17T18:54:22] koxx / Francois Deslandes: yes
[2023-10-17T18:54:28] Mo: It sparked luckily I had a fuse otherwise I would have had my 92v battery popping
[2023-10-17T18:54:59] Mirono escooters: BMS should protect
[2023-10-17T18:55:24] Mo: It didn't get that far. Had the fuse in between battery and vesc take the hit instead
[2023-10-17T18:55:37] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Did it do any damage to it?
[2023-10-17T18:55:40] koxx / Francois Deslandes: I can't really blame Spintend. This VESC is something like 2 years old. It means 2.5/3 years old design. Not sure phase filters were known/used at the time. And my VESC is still working perfectly after 2 years
[2023-10-17T18:56:03] koxx / Francois Deslandes: nope
[2023-10-17T18:56:06] Unknown: Yes Bms should shut down battery & give short circuit error
[2023-10-17T18:56:16] Mo: Anyone on here that can help with repairs?
[2023-10-17T18:56:30] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I used phase filters on 75/200, 100/100 x2, 100/100 single, 80100, 85200

[2023-10-17T18:56:54] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But 6.05 didnt test yet
[2023-10-17T18:57:21] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Maybe a few settings are wrong in advanced tabs
[2023-10-17T18:58:08] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Flipsky doesnt have filters, it can blow up your ass very quickly
[2023-10-17T18:58:08] Mo: Or anyone you can recommend?
[2023-10-17T18:58:38] Oreo huzky: Sadly no
[2023-10-17T19:02:00] puneDir: Open holes Open threads Add spacer And youre ready to go
[2023-10-17T19:17:36] puneDir: Elshan had a bms cut with ignition mod and mosfets fine
[2023-10-17T19:17:56] puneDir: Actually battery fuse burned but still
[2023-10-17T19:18:28] puneDir: Maybe ignition mod helps mosfets
[2023-10-17T19:18:42] Mirono escooters: I'm talking about underv BMS cut
[2023-10-17T19:18:49] Mirono escooters: You should set values respectively to your battery
[2023-10-17T19:18:53] Mirono escooters: And then it's a cheap good vesc..

[2023-10-17T19:57:04] Simone: no I worked on the thickness of the feet...
[2023-10-17T19:57:37] Yamal: Well, I like it when people prepare or power on chassis that are not Xiaomi, don't get me wrong, Being in that telegram group in the end I will end up with some Xiaomi but I hope sooner rather than later

[2023-10-17T19:59:55] Simone: There's not even room for a hair

[2023-10-17T20:01:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: In length , no width
[2023-10-17T20:02:18] Simone: The mounting of the 3mm disc drove me crazy
[2023-10-17T20:02:52] Yamal: Top speed ? 0-100km/h ‚Äú‚Äù
[2023-10-17T20:03:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Solved it nicely
[2023-10-17T20:07:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: Also compared to other vescs the power stage has much more ceramic caps
[2023-10-17T20:15:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Tell us more
[2023-10-17T20:15:28] Simone: Top speed 154kmh gps 0-100kmh I never tried it with dragy when I put the 22s battery
[2023-10-17T20:16:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Knowledge/price what he said =

[2023-10-17T20:17:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Is it available?
[2023-10-17T20:18:19] Face de Pin Suc√©: Well, it's only 7mm less if I remember correctly, for a centimeter more in length
[2023-10-17T20:19:15] Simone: Yes I made a "frankstein" using the front casting of the vsett11, the rear casting of the zero11x, the battery box with platform and aluminum adaptation shims completely redone from 0
[2023-10-17T20:19:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes just 3mm of difference ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that dramatic
[2023-10-17T20:19:51] Face de Pin Suc√©: Length is very important to me, because I'm always at a millimeter for the length x)
[2023-10-17T20:21:26] Simone: <photos/photo_10329@17-10-2023_20-21-26.jpg>

[2023-10-17T20:21:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yeah but u have a lot more ceramic caps, which are very important for high power esc
[2023-10-17T20:22:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: Funny parts about Flipsky 350
[2023-10-17T20:22:36] Yamal: And what type are your engines? I imagine 33/2 for sure because of the top speed.. and the length of the magnet?
[2023-10-17T20:22:39] Face de Pin Suc√©: No ceramic caps x)
[2023-10-17T20:24:29] Simone: LY 33√ó2 70H...but the maximum speed can be improved... I achieved that result with the Kelly 7230s and with a less than perfect road
[2023-10-17T20:25:58] Simone: I think that with the right path, the vesc by BRIESC and with field weakening
[2023-10-17T20:26:10] Simone: we can do better
[2023-10-17T20:26:21] Simone: it all depends on the folly of the driver
[2023-10-17T20:26:25] Simone: <animation>
[2023-10-17T20:26:27] Yamal: Well look, there are now 2 of us who are going to go from Kelly to Vesc
[2023-10-17T20:27:34] Simone: I wanted to try them. I will soon find out if this change has brought further benefits
[2023-10-17T20:31:13] Yamal: They say that vesc is the future, now with the 7230 you were not short,,, Did you find torque" with the speed winding?
[2023-10-17T20:32:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: You should be happy just if it works üòÇ
[2023-10-17T20:32:22] Simone: The transition to vesc was mainly created for power management
[2023-10-17T20:33:03] Simone: with kelly you get "tired" more and also looking for maximum grip by dosing the acceleration as if you had traction control
[2023-10-17T20:33:16] Simone: destroys the tires in 300km
[2023-10-17T20:34:01] Simone: Beyond this... there is the whole aspect of efficiency in terms of power and consumption
[2023-10-17T20:36:36] Yamal: energy efficiency, acceleration curve, smoothness, explosive strength, you see it's whatever you want it to be! By the way, the configuration issue is scary!üòÇ
[2023-10-17T20:38:46] Yamal: I come from the 7218 and I'm going to the Tronic 250, I don't need anything else
[2023-10-17T20:39:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: 7218 is more powerful than tronic I think
[2023-10-17T20:41:07] Yamal: I have personally tried the tronic in a Rion and it is scary, with its 22/3 and 60h engines it is a real beast, I am going to take 33/2 65h
[2023-10-17T20:42:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-10-17T20:42:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: If you think that a Rion with Rion motors and a tronic is a beast..
[2023-10-17T20:42:32] Face de Pin Suc√©: You not ready
[2023-10-17T20:42:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: I‚Äôve same motors, same controller, and looks died
[2023-10-17T20:43:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Compared to other vescs, even flipsky 75100‚Ä¶.
[2023-10-17T20:45:59] Yamal: I no think about it, I checked it, for me an e-scooter that you accelerate when you go at 100km/h and the rear wheel skids is a beast, the strength it has at 27kg of weight is top for me, I really liked driving it
[2023-10-17T20:46:48] Yamal: and let's not forget that it is one of the few hyperScooters on the market,, what one does at home what is it?
[2023-10-17T20:49:00] Oreo huzky: Is it for two motors or one?
[2023-10-17T20:49:14] Simone: Sorry, let me explain better...what you see are two units next to each other
[2023-10-17T20:49:22] Oreo huzky: Very nice
[2023-10-17T20:49:40] Oreo huzky: Where is it sold
[2023-10-17T20:50:33] Simone: The price are 660‚Ç¨ for this 2 units
[2023-10-17T20:50:40] Oreo huzky: Ah okay
[2023-10-17T20:50:48] Oreo huzky: It looked like dual
[2023-10-17T20:51:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: I don't understand your last sentence
[2023-10-17T20:52:03] Simone: Directly from the manufacturer @brieru
[2023-10-17T20:52:21] Oreo huzky: Website?
[2023-10-17T20:56:34] Yamal: Let's see, first of all, excuse the translator's English, because the spoken English I defend myself but the writing is still bad... What I mean in the end is that today there are few hyperscooters on the market although people use this term more and more, and we are talking about scooters that come out of the box and not about scooter that are made in our homes
[2023-10-17T20:57:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, and what about preparators ? Because, you know, a Slack Core or a Rion, it's only a prototype sold as "a serie"
[2023-10-17T21:03:29] haku: Guys do you know how much phase amps can this motor handle on a 60v battery? I set my ubox to 45a per side and i noticed im not getting the top speed i use to get from old controllers.
[2023-10-17T21:04:11] haku: Right now its i set it at 100 phase
[2023-10-17T21:06:06] haku: I see. It was gps. I always havw gps on when testing. If i add field weakening i have to decrease battery amps right?
[2023-10-17T21:07:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: What is your settings?
[2023-10-17T21:07:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Phase amp? Batt amp?
[2023-10-17T21:07:25] haku: Gotcha thanks
[2023-10-17T21:07:40] haku: Phase is 100 amd battery is 45a

[2023-10-17T21:13:02] Yamal: For me, both Slack and Rion are 2 hyperscooters, and Slack, for example, has sold many, especially in Korea, and Rion has a long history with the carbon ones and now with the new Apex and I take my hat off to both the Gal and the 2 brothers from Numo, and beware, I love the phenomenon of France, currently for me in the top in the world in terms of prepared scooters, and races, I fall in love with each phase of the engine
[2023-10-17T21:14:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: Have you ever seen the inside of those escooters ? Because for me it's not professional at all
[2023-10-17T21:14:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: Rion is based on fake performances
[2023-10-17T21:15:15] Yamal: And slack ?
[2023-10-17T21:15:25] rosheee: slack is tool for communication
[2023-10-17T21:16:35] Oreo huzky: The throttle of rion is kinda cool
[2023-10-17T21:16:42] Simone: if it weighs 29kg there is a reason...
[2023-10-17T21:16:47] Yamal: I have seen it several times inside
[2023-10-17T21:17:16] Face de Pin Suc√©: Slack inside with the Kellys and bad wiring, I've seen some people doing a better wiring than Numo company
[2023-10-17T21:17:30] Simone: Even with carbon and parts machined from solid aluminium, a high-performance vehicle cannot weigh 29kg
[2023-10-17T21:18:26] Oreo huzky: Battery weights more than 29kg
[2023-10-17T21:18:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, it's too light for performances
[2023-10-17T21:18:50] Simone: My 22s10p weight 18kg
[2023-10-17T21:19:00] Oreo huzky: Wut
[2023-10-17T21:19:34] Oreo huzky: mine weighs 33kg it‚Äôs 20s 8p
[2023-10-17T21:19:36] Simone: 2 motor 70H with pmt t41 ~ 18/19kg
[2023-10-17T21:19:46] Oreo huzky: But 21700
[2023-10-17T21:20:08] Oreo huzky: Only battery
[2023-10-17T21:20:23] Oreo huzky: And motors weigh each 8.5kg
[2023-10-17T21:20:58] Simone: when you weighed it you had the balance off...it's impossible 33kg
[2023-10-17T21:21:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: 29kg is the single motor version
[2023-10-17T21:21:22] Oreo huzky: Let me calculate cell weigh
[2023-10-17T21:22:02] Simone: Samsung 40T = ~ 67gr
[2023-10-17T21:22:17] Simone: 20s8p = 160 cells
[2023-10-17T21:22:30] Oreo huzky: Oh never mind
[2023-10-17T21:22:46] Oreo huzky: Idk why I had 33kg in my mind
[2023-10-17T21:22:47] Jan: Lol the steering damper ü§£
[2023-10-17T21:22:59] Oreo huzky: It‚Äôs about 11kg
[2023-10-17T21:22:59] Simone: 160 √ó 67gr = 10720gr
[2023-10-17T21:23:04] Oreo huzky: Ye
[2023-10-17T21:24:58] Simone: possible...but I think a little more. Consider bms, barley paper, strips, insulators, cables, connectors, heat shrink and if you used glue to join the cells
[2023-10-17T21:25:05] Oreo huzky: Yes
[2023-10-17T21:25:17] Oreo huzky: Should be 12,5kg
[2023-10-17T21:25:24] Simone: I agree
[2023-10-17T21:25:27] Oreo huzky: Ye
[2023-10-17T21:25:46] Simone: you dont like it? üòÅ
[2023-10-17T21:25:56] Oreo huzky: When lifting up it feels like 80kg
[2023-10-17T21:27:19] Jan: Its the absolutely worst and has not to be in the scooter industryüëå
[2023-10-17T21:28:52] Yamal: ?
[2023-10-17T21:29:28] Yamal: <photos/photo_10339@17-10-2023_21-29-28.jpg>
[2023-10-17T21:30:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: He mean steering damper is useless on e scooter
[2023-10-17T21:31:16] Simone: It is a clone of Matris. When I have ‚Ç¨400 to throw into a steering damper...I will do it
[2023-10-17T21:32:28] Simone: Probably yes...but the placebo effect avoids the wooble üòÇ
[2023-10-17T21:33:23] Jan: Its only there because nobody apparently knows how to design it without
[2023-10-17T21:33:25] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Agree. To use steering damper the right way you must do the base itself the right way and dont make it wobble when throttle on idle on speed lol Or when braking
[2023-10-17T21:34:07] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Segway knows
[2023-10-17T21:34:12] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Inmotion knows too
[2023-10-17T21:34:18] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: RS is perfect example
[2023-10-17T21:34:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: The main problem is that the scooter shouldn‚Äôt used for those speed üòÇ
[2023-10-17T21:34:39] Oreo huzky: If you have battery in front it‚Äôs really nice
[2023-10-17T21:34:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: <sticker>
[2023-10-17T21:34:56] Simone: For fireworks?
[2023-10-17T21:34:57] Simone: <animation>
[2023-10-17T21:34:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: <sticker>
[2023-10-17T21:34:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: <sticker>
[2023-10-17T21:35:34] Oreo huzky: No for looks and maybe fireworks but that‚Äôs a free upgrade
[2023-10-17T21:35:37] –í–ª–∞–¥: what model of scooter
[2023-10-17T21:35:46] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Slack core
[2023-10-17T21:37:05] Oreo huzky: <video_file>
[2023-10-17T21:37:31] Oreo huzky: That was pretty scary with only e brake

[2023-10-17T21:40:26] Yamal: Old photos
[2023-10-17T21:40:36] Oreo huzky: <sticker>
[2023-10-17T21:40:44] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Their trail is very off. Like always negative, especially when you will push it down
[2023-10-17T21:40:47] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Yes, its bad
[2023-10-17T21:41:23] Oreo huzky: Would 30s 8p fit In dualtron thunder battery bay?
[2023-10-17T21:42:29] puneDir: I also want that
[2023-10-17T21:42:33] puneDir: Is it really that bad?
[2023-10-17T21:42:53] Yamal: <photos/photo_10343@17-10-2023_21-42-53.jpg>
[2023-10-17T21:42:57] rosheee: xD
[2023-10-17T21:43:17] rosheee: weight should be on ground
[2023-10-17T21:43:18] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Remove damper, weaken steering bearings and you will never ride carefully with that
[2023-10-17T21:43:23] Oreo huzky: But rear foot rest don‚Äôt like a bit to big
[2023-10-17T21:43:32] Simone: Geometry and resistance with air when release gas or brake...these are the causes that trigger the wooble
[2023-10-17T21:43:52] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Only geometry. If your trail becomes close to zero or becomes negative, here you go the bad thing can happen anytime. Its strongly restricted in motorcycle world i.e
[2023-10-17T21:44:11] Yamal: When these people were going 28 s on a dualtron we "didn't know that electric scooters existed"
[2023-10-17T21:45:10] Yamal: and now Numo Korea doesn't do the wiring well, right?
[2023-10-17T21:45:19] Yamal: üòÇ
[2023-10-17T21:45:30] Simone: I assure you that if you suddenly get up at 150kmh after you are lowered... you will see that it is not just the geometry that is the problem
[2023-10-17T21:45:48] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I do ride and know what im talking about
[2023-10-17T21:46:13] Yamal: And now the carbon kidney is not a fucking work of art and engineering, right?
[2023-10-17T21:46:49] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Get segway gt, make it go 150kmh and try for yourself, you will be surprised that your position doesnt matter
[2023-10-17T21:47:03] haku: Thats nice. What scooter is that?
[2023-10-17T21:47:53] Yamal: I love your work, and I know that many people make a living with this, or prefer to sell their product, but let's not underestimate the work of others heh
[2023-10-17T21:48:10] Mo: Hello Does here repair vescs?
[2023-10-17T21:49:09] D J: Website?
[2023-10-17T21:50:04] Mirono escooters: Depends where and wich
[2023-10-17T21:50:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: Looks better than what I saw earlier x)
[2023-10-17T21:50:42] Mo: I have 2 ubox dual 100a
[2023-10-17T21:50:48] Mo: I'm in the uk
[2023-10-17T21:51:16] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: üî•ü§§ü§§porn
[2023-10-17T21:53:03] Mirono escooters: Ah sad. Too far
[2023-10-17T21:53:35] Simone: I'm an admirer of the GT2 chassis even without having tried it but I'm skeptical that there won't be any imbalances
[2023-10-17T21:53:45] haku: Is RS the yellow scooter that you can lower? I really like that one. Very innovative
[2023-10-17T21:53:46] puneDir: yay my spotwelder has arrived
[2023-10-17T21:54:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: Have seen it in real, it looks very chinese crap :/
[2023-10-17T21:54:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: I think suspensions fixations will break
[2023-10-17T21:54:32] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Vsett 10+ on steroids
[2023-10-17T21:55:24] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You can trust me, it doesnt know what is wobble at all. In any conditions. if it starts to wobble (it stabilizes very quick), then you did something very, very wrong and a big mistake in some maneuver in steering or landed after a jump with a very large deviation between the trajectories of the front and rear wheels. On other scooters you will be dead btw
[2023-10-17T21:55:29] Face de Pin Suc√©: Well, I agree with you, I ride 150Kmh without steering damper, BUT it can be useful for track circuir
[2023-10-17T21:55:30] rosheee: what happened`
[2023-10-17T21:55:41] haku: Does it? I have to see it in person. Ive seen paid youtube videos and it looks and the build is amazing.
[2023-10-17T21:55:49] Simone: I from Rion admire their marketing... the product is nothing amazing... I don't have a 5-axis CNC or an autoclave to laminate carbon at home. but we don't have the same finances. I would probably do the same or better with the same ones üòä
[2023-10-17T21:59:01] rosheee: then let's go
[2023-10-17T21:59:36] Simone: It may be as you say but it would be enough to see a hypercar that raises 50cm of wing to notice an imbalance... and we are talking about a profile studied in a wind tunnel... not a person who rises from under the center line of the handlebars
[2023-10-17T22:00:08] Simone: Sooner or later I will build a gt2 based project üòä
[2023-10-17T22:00:19] rosheee: nice ^^
[2023-10-17T22:00:24] rosheee: can't wait to see it
[2023-10-17T22:00:24] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: The closest possible compare to segway gt steering is motorcycle
[2023-10-17T22:00:56] Mo: Where are you based
[2023-10-17T22:01:05] rosheee: what's the problem ^^?
[2023-10-17T22:01:32] Simone: I understand what you're saying but I'll give you another example. naked motorbikes and supersport motorbikes
[2023-10-17T22:01:47] Mo: One short circuited today within 1 week of owning it, and the other the canbus failed
[2023-10-17T22:02:00] rosheee: then warranty
[2023-10-17T22:02:01] rosheee: write spintend
[2023-10-17T22:02:04] rosheee: send it back
[2023-10-17T22:02:09] rosheee: canbus failed ^^?
[2023-10-17T22:02:51] Mo: No such thing as warranty apparently
[2023-10-17T22:03:22] rosheee: bullshit ^^'
[2023-10-17T22:03:22] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: In motorcycle worlds i will compare it to cruiser
[2023-10-17T22:03:49] Mirono escooters: BE
[2023-10-17T22:03:51] Mo: Not much I can do other than get it repaired
[2023-10-17T22:03:56] Mo: üá¨üáß
[2023-10-17T22:04:02] rosheee: i send u PM
[2023-10-17T22:04:39] Simone: I will remove the steering damper
[2023-10-17T22:04:45] Simone: do I mount it like this?

[2023-10-17T22:09:18] Simone: Compressione della molla rallentata ed estensione idem...a me mi sembra na stronzata enorme...c'√® un registro per regolare la velocit√† di ritorno apposta
[2023-10-17T22:11:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Il problema √® che le cartucce del rebound di sti ammortizzatori sono fatti per molle pi√π morbide, non a caso esplodono a tanti col nami , lavora palesemente oltre al limite

[2023-10-17T22:33:47] Mirono escooters: Can't handle the truth?
[2023-10-17T22:34:26] rosheee: never seen 3shul logfiles
[2023-10-17T22:34:31] rosheee: all fake performance
[2023-10-17T22:35:16] Simone: It's thanks to fans of the genre that Rion finances itself... it gets thousands of ‚Ç¨ in advance sales and people wait two years
[2023-10-17T22:36:08] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-10-17T22:36:09] Mirono escooters: Tru

[2023-10-17T22:37:15] Simone: Rion performance? my friend fries 2√ó tronic250 while standing still with the intention of climbing a step while accompanying the hand scooter (he was off the scooter)
[2023-10-17T22:38:54] rosheee: and u never fried esc?
[2023-10-17T22:39:00] rosheee: only tronic esc's fried?
[2023-10-17T22:39:06] rosheee: where 3shul logfiles?
[2023-10-17T22:39:18] rosheee: what esc's u use?
[2023-10-17T22:40:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: Impressive how roschee changed his opinion on tronic
[2023-10-17T22:40:44] rosheee: i am open for everything
[2023-10-17T22:40:46] rosheee: except flipsky
[2023-10-17T22:41:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: I still remind u when u were super hater of tronic Xd
[2023-10-17T22:41:49] Mirono escooters: 180* turn
[2023-10-17T22:47:36] rosheee: yes because he didn't send warranty
[2023-10-17T22:47:43] rosheee: then he and me had fuckeria fight
[2023-10-17T22:47:46] rosheee: then ‚ù§Ô∏è came
[2023-10-17T22:48:48] rosheee: so where?
[2023-10-17T22:48:53] rosheee: where 3shul logfiles?
[2023-10-17T22:52:08] Simone: For the moment no üò¨ü§ü
[2023-10-17T22:52:43] D J: I've seen some fries
[2023-10-17T22:53:30] D J: I haven't seen any fried yet...
[2023-10-17T22:53:56] Simone: if you consider that it is an "exclusive" vehicle...proportionately there are more tronics burned than flipskys üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-10-17T22:56:26] rosheee: and why u hate ^^'?
[2023-10-17T22:56:57] rosheee: i had flipskies -> 0 worked of 10 tronic burned spintend g30 ninebot m365
[2023-10-17T22:57:04] rosheee: but nice u never fried an esc
[2023-10-17T22:57:46] NetworkDir: XD
[2023-10-17T22:58:19] Mirono escooters: All vescs burn End of discussion xD
[2023-10-17T22:59:49] Simone: No hate. if you put Rion at the top of escooters and then it's just an expensive toy, what comes out of those who have their "hands in the dough" is a hearty laugh and spreads that what they sell is just smoke in the eyes
[2023-10-17T23:02:52] rosheee: motors u had smoked as well
[2023-10-17T23:03:19] rosheee: but anyway ^^' at least they learn with each burned esc
[2023-10-17T23:06:28] rosheee: but idk ^^' me no engineer
[2023-10-17T23:06:39] rosheee: so where 3shul logfiles pls ^^?
[2023-10-17T23:07:51] Mirono escooters: Jeez calm
[2023-10-17T23:08:32] rosheee: <sticker>
[2023-10-17T23:13:01] Simone: I burned 65mm with 470A of battery due to high temperatures and undersized cables (enamel intact and copper intact)
[2023-10-17T23:13:15] Simone: but that's my mistake
[2023-10-17T23:13:16] rosheee: and 900A phase?
[2023-10-17T23:14:17] rosheee: 10awg phase?
[2023-10-17T23:14:19] Simone: I don't know how many phase A...with the Kellys I have never recorded the screen while keeping the acaduser application open
[2023-10-17T23:14:24] Simone: Yes
[2023-10-17T23:14:29] Simone: Yes
[2023-10-17T23:14:32] rosheee: 470A per motor?
[2023-10-17T23:14:47] Simone: No 470A battery total
[2023-10-17T23:15:04] rosheee: continuous?
[2023-10-17T23:15:19] Simone: continue around 400A
[2023-10-17T23:16:57] Simone: between 385A and 405A to be exact (consider that the refresh times of the BMS are not excellent)... but I recorded this data for about 10 seconds
[2023-10-17T23:17:27] rosheee: send =D
[2023-10-17T23:23:27] Simone: <video_file>
[2023-10-17T23:24:22] Simone: at the end of the video it settles at 350A
[2023-10-17T23:24:49] Simone: consider that I was short sleeved while attempting my PR üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-10-17T23:29:16] Face de Pin Suc√©: Wtf, go check our youtube channel, and I don't log using VESC because I log using SmartDisplay now
[2023-10-17T23:29:45] Face de Pin Suc√©: Btw, Rion claimed 160Kmh when there was Rion Re80, that wasn't even able to reach more than 105Kmh
[2023-10-17T23:29:50] rosheee: üòú
[2023-10-17T23:30:04] Face de Pin Suc√©: Hahaha another Rion lover üòç
[2023-10-17T23:30:12] rosheee: vesc log csv ^^
[2023-10-17T23:30:37] Face de Pin Suc√©: I don't do vesc log, because I use SmartDisplay, which take all the canbus messages
[2023-10-17T23:31:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: That is not possible to have a correct vesc log because of this, like for real
[2023-10-17T23:31:20] rosheee: believe u =D but i jsut wanna see one
[2023-10-17T23:31:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: Hahaha quite amazing
[2023-10-17T23:32:05] rosheee: :-P
[2023-10-17T23:32:36] haku: What is your youtube if you dont mind me asking?
[2023-10-17T23:33:48] rosheee: @SibClimb u know someone without smartdisplay?
[2023-10-17T23:33:51] rosheee: using curry?
[2023-10-17T23:34:23] Face de Pin Suc√©: https://youtu.be/FIRvMWQFl6A?si=CqXnGFIg08t8IkOP
[2023-10-17T23:34:52] Face de Pin Suc√©: I know with Surron and C700 But on escooter, not sure if there are
[2023-10-17T23:35:50] rosheee: dis insta360 ?
[2023-10-17T23:35:54] rosheee: what battery u have in there?
[2023-10-17T23:36:20] rosheee: Rage Mechanics competition battery ^^
[2023-10-17T23:36:32] haku: Damn ive never seen a scooter race on a track. Onlu straight lines here. Pretty impressive skills
[2023-10-17T23:36:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: By the way, when SmartDisplay shows 26KW we have 32-33KW in RT Data of VESC and we think that vesc power calculating is fucked up, because we litteraly take battery amps and voltage to calculate power
[2023-10-17T23:37:21] rosheee: 21s?
[2023-10-17T23:37:26] rosheee: 22s?
[2023-10-17T23:37:56] Face de Pin Suc√©: 22S11P But sadly, a fucking GTK decided to act as shit, showing 92V fully charged and was at 87V in reality x)
[2023-10-17T23:38:07] rosheee: 11p XD
[2023-10-17T23:38:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: That's why the race start with only 86.7V
[2023-10-17T23:38:12] rosheee: holy maccar0ni
[2023-10-17T23:38:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes Rage Mechanics competition battery hehe
[2023-10-17T23:38:46] rosheee: XD idk why i thought it was 20S6P üòÜ
[2023-10-17T23:38:57] rosheee: why controller timeout?`
[2023-10-17T23:39:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: But not pushed at full power because we need the setup to not burn x)
[2023-10-17T23:39:23] rosheee: escs ^^?
[2023-10-17T23:39:47] Face de Pin Suc√©: Haha because it was before when it was Dualtron Compact and not yet RM-One with custom modified chassis
[2023-10-17T23:40:00] rosheee: XD aha
[2023-10-17T23:40:23] rosheee: never volt drop
[2023-10-17T23:40:50] Face de Pin Suc√©: Had a cut and timeout of 500ms, the pilot was pushing the throttle before the 500ms so it was triggering in timeout until he completely released
[2023-10-17T23:40:57] Face de Pin Suc√©: C350
[2023-10-17T23:40:58] rosheee: üòÜ
[2023-10-17T23:41:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: But pushing 140+kmh on straight lines like this shows that the motors are in pain
[2023-10-17T23:41:31] rosheee: yes
[2023-10-17T23:41:40] rosheee: also they heat when no throttle
[2023-10-17T23:41:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: Stay tuned, more videos to come on race track
[2023-10-17T23:41:45] rosheee: üòÜbut machine is fuckeria
[2023-10-17T23:41:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: Because of inertia
[2023-10-17T23:41:55] rosheee: no steering damper?
[2023-10-17T23:42:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: So sad that didn't started at 92V :/
[2023-10-17T23:42:19] Face de Pin Suc√©: Maybe would have reached more speed
[2023-10-17T23:42:23] Face de Pin Suc√©: Nope not needed
[2023-10-17T23:42:48] rosheee: nice track btw

[2023-10-17T23:47:05] rosheee: 314 battery amps pushed
[2023-10-17T23:48:01] rosheee: 330A peak battery on both escs then
[2023-10-17T23:50:47] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes
[2023-10-17T23:51:17] Face de Pin Suc√©: You will see soon video of Xelectrics in spain with 3 escooters with telemetry;)

[2023-10-17T23:56:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: Super important to analyze where you accelerate in a corner to try to improve yourself

[2023-10-18T00:11:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, just imagine having a radio with your pilot, you can tell him that he can push more in a corner, or to be careful of low battery or anything
[2023-10-18T00:11:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: We even have tyre pressure üòÇ

[2023-10-18T00:13:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes it is
[2023-10-18T00:13:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: We developped this because we wanted to be able to follow our pilots in live in pit
[2023-10-18T00:14:37] Face de Pin Suc√©: And also, when someone from the team cannot come to the race, he just connects to the server and can enjoy the datas of the race, we call him in visio and he's with us

[2023-10-18T00:40:37] Oreo huzky: Only had like 200/300 meteres and no helmet on gps showed 98 but I think the test was bad because bad cellular signal
[2023-10-18T00:41:29] Oreo huzky: Because I had driven it 110kmh before and this felt faster than 110 but I could be wrong
[2023-10-18T00:48:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt think you have 300A
[2023-10-18T00:48:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: Maybe for both motors
[2023-10-18T01:21:01] Yamal: Rion is limited by engines! at 130km/h understand me 60h 22/3 And if they put 75h 33/2 how much would it be? but they don't want to! They focus more on acceleration, they don't need it either. We are also 11" e-scooters, no need, good morning group!‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•‚ö°Ô∏èüî•

[2023-10-18T03:46:20] Martin Kaktits: When vesc shows power draw, does it multiply amps by real time voltage, by max inout voltage or by nominal voltage?
[2023-10-18T03:48:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: Realtime voltage
[2023-10-18T04:03:50] haku: Is it a bad for the vesc to keep tripping the bms when voltage is low? I cant avoid it sometimes the voltage drop on my battery is nuts.

[2023-10-18T05:44:58] haku: There is alot of normal batteries. But high discharge battery i cannot find more than 1k amps
[2023-10-18T05:45:49] rosheee: I ask my friend in like 5h
[2023-10-18T05:46:12] rosheee: But he said that the part u hold in hand ran hot AF
[2023-10-18T05:46:29] rosheee: I think he experienced0
[2023-10-18T05:46:39] haku: I see. Maybe take breaks
[2023-10-18T05:46:40] rosheee: He gonna flex my 20S today xD
[2023-10-18T05:46:51] rosheee: But breaks were never an option
[2023-10-18T05:47:08] haku: Congrats. Is welded with copper?
[2023-10-18T05:47:40] rosheee: Ofc
[2023-10-18T05:47:46] rosheee: But he use bosch flex
[2023-10-18T05:47:53] rosheee: To flex of 6awg cable
[2023-10-18T05:47:54] rosheee: XD
[2023-10-18T05:47:58] haku: Nice!

[2023-10-18T05:56:22] haku: Remove that part and have it bolted with cnc aluminum is what im thinking
[2023-10-18T05:56:39] haku: Extend the dropouts
[2023-10-18T05:56:41] rosheee: Yah but
[2023-10-18T05:56:59] rosheee: It is ur g30 :-)
[2023-10-18T05:57:19] haku: Just an idea. I got it for free. Found it on a park disassembled
[2023-10-18T05:58:03] haku: Prolly stolen. Took the battery and left
[2023-10-18T05:58:57] rosheee: XD
[2023-10-18T05:59:06] rosheee: Grind serial
[2023-10-18T05:59:27] rosheee: These are the 3.5kw ali motors?
[2023-10-18T06:08:51] haku: Its laotie motors
[2023-10-18T06:10:02] rosheee: U need thicker cables
[2023-10-18T06:10:13] rosheee: Dis phase cable thin as me benis
[2023-10-18T06:10:27] haku: üòÇ
[2023-10-18T06:11:19] haku: I know i do need to change it. I have 11 guage cables but ill do that after battery
[2023-10-18T06:12:07] rosheee: XD then not fit g30
[2023-10-18T06:15:35] haku: Can factory g30 handle 72v?
[2023-10-18T06:15:41] haku: Motor
[2023-10-18T06:15:49] rosheee: Idk
[2023-10-18T06:15:53] rosheee: Yes
[2023-10-18T06:16:00] rosheee: When not 1337A
[2023-10-18T06:16:36] haku: Hah is that what you are doing? Or you have vsett motor?
[2023-10-18T06:18:51] rosheee: Vsett and others
[2023-10-18T06:20:19] rosheee: Vsett may run bit hot with 20S
[2023-10-18T06:23:04] haku: I see.
[2023-10-18T06:24:03] rosheee: But idk
[2023-10-18T06:25:25] haku: Im new and still learning about these scooter parts
[2023-10-18T06:25:31] Unknown: https://batteryhookup.com/products/super-beast-module-with-48-headway-38120-hp-3-2v-8ah-24v
[2023-10-18T06:27:11] haku: That will absolutely work. From what i was told in other forums to use lipo. But this was one of my options too
[2023-10-18T06:28:41] rosheee: But nice that u go full send and build ur own battery
[2023-10-18T06:28:43] rosheee: Respect
[2023-10-18T06:29:17] Unknown: You cut the bars and make it 12v. 6 cells can push 240a pulse each. I have a maletrics and was gonna use a homemade with cells a friend is giving me from there not these. Also use my 30a charger and set to 12v to keep voltage same on all welds.
[2023-10-18T06:29:35] haku: Thanks man. Honestly this very exciting to me.
[2023-10-18T06:30:25] rosheee: XD y? Cuz u could die or blew shit up?
[2023-10-18T06:30:56] haku: Haha. Its just a dream of mine to build a solid battery.
[2023-10-18T06:31:04] rosheee: My advise Go for performance and quality parts from 0
[2023-10-18T06:31:10] rosheee: Not cheap crap
[2023-10-18T06:31:38] haku: My frame is a cheapy frame but i will not cheap out on the batteries
[2023-10-18T06:32:26] haku: I got this scooter for a good price so i can afford to spend extra to make a battery.
[2023-10-18T06:32:32] Unknown: https://batteryhookup.com/products/2x-spim08hp-3-7v-8ah-cells-with-threaded-insert My friend is giving me a bunch oh of these. 6p4s I'll be over 2k amps.
[2023-10-18T06:32:34] rosheee: Better wait until u have dat $ rather than buy crap
[2023-10-18T06:33:02] haku: Thats nice but those are for pouch packs
[2023-10-18T06:33:09] rosheee: Then need big benis ESCs as well
[2023-10-18T06:33:34] haku: True. All i have for now is dual spintend 100/100
[2023-10-18T06:33:59] rosheee: Ask someone here for vesc setup
[2023-10-18T06:34:10] Unknown: Yeah assembling a battery for the welder or jump start space shuttle whatever.
[2023-10-18T06:34:14] rosheee: Or maybe our wiki is done until then
[2023-10-18T06:34:45] rosheee: Cuz fail can happen
[2023-10-18T06:35:08] rosheee: Cool it good

[2023-10-18T06:36:27] haku: Dam. What esc is that?
[2023-10-18T06:46:21] haku: Malectrics and do .2 copper?
[2023-10-18T06:46:36] rosheee: Was tronic v1
[2023-10-18T06:46:37] haku: Can?
[2023-10-18T06:46:55] rosheee: But with 2 masculin settings
[2023-10-18T07:31:56] Oreo huzky: Yes I was speaking for both motors because I don‚Äôt want to push cl350 past 150A battery
[2023-10-18T08:21:48] Mirono escooters: Good lipo x kweld welds copper sandwich ez
[2023-10-18T08:38:06] Gabe Enzo: I neeed a g30 frame bro
[2023-10-18T08:38:47] Gabe Enzo: lucky cunt
[2023-10-18T08:40:31] rosheee: 5 fingaz discount ^^
[2023-10-18T08:41:40] rosheee: <video_file>
[2023-10-18T08:47:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I am using Malectrics V4, it's pretty good and does it's job well. Using two 3S2P lipo for copper sandwich and make my 20s6p and 20s3p with it.
[2023-10-18T08:47:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I only tried .1 copper so far. But eh, it should probably be able to do more.
[2023-10-18T08:48:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: You were in Albaida ?
[2023-10-18T08:49:24] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes I stop right now hahaha
[2023-10-18T08:49:35] Face de Pin Suc√©: Where does it come from ?

[2023-10-18T09:06:31] Mo: Hello, is there anyone here that's capable of repairing spintend ubox v2 100a dual (2 to repair) Also What do you reccomend as a controller for 2x 8000w 120v motors with 85v 22s 36ah battery
[2023-10-18T09:07:29] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, but can be expensive to repair with shipping and components and time on it with testing and everything :/
[2023-10-18T09:07:50] Face de Pin Suc√©: And I would recommend to use 3Shul C350 if you go to 22S battery
[2023-10-18T09:08:25] Mo: Can you private message me pls
[2023-10-18T09:08:40] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes
[2023-10-18T09:09:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: Sent you a PM
[2023-10-18T12:48:21] Gabe Enzo: how long does spintend take for y'all? been a week 4 me nothing came.
[2023-10-18T13:20:09] Happy Giraffe: Its usually under 2 weeks, see the tracking
[2023-10-18T13:30:07] Santiago: For me it was 10 days to Spain
[2023-10-18T18:48:45] cihan: I'm about to place an order for makerbase 60100HP. Can I be sure that I'll be able to install it to navee n65 and also make sure regenerative break will work? I don't need a dashboard at all. So I don't care if dashboard works or not. I only need dashboard to turn on rear light and front light. It's OK if they are always on when scooter is on.
[2023-10-18T18:51:24] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: regenerative break will always work.
[2023-10-18T18:53:10] cihan: Thanks, I asked since I like the idea of it and I use it a lot rather than disc brake. And I only have regenerative at the front so it should work, otherwise I cannot stop.)
[2023-10-18T18:53:27] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: xd
[2023-10-18T18:53:30] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: me too, done that at the start
[2023-10-18T18:54:15] cihan: And I really like front regenerative of navee n65, it's pretty strong and really strong at low speeds and I feel really secure at very steep paths like going down to underground garage.
[2023-10-18T18:56:02] cihan: What I learned after buying navee n65 : scooter isn't just a strong chassis and big tires. Controller and battery matters.)
[2023-10-18T18:56:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes. But I hope you are running it with custom battery?
[2023-10-18T18:57:19] cihan: I'll probably always charge the navee battery to full to save makerbase vesc and once I feel battert goes worse, I'll try build a better one with more and high quality cells.
[2023-10-18T18:57:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: When using stock battery, it might cause trouble if the BMS does not communicate with the controller.
[2023-10-18T18:58:13] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I dont know much about Navee, if they got % from battery BMS or measure it by voltage. But on Xiaomi or NineBot it limits it to only 19A when not connected.
[2023-10-18T18:58:54] cihan: I'll use stock battery. But I won't use high power, only 1500W when battery is full. I have no idea about VESC yet so I don't know how they communicate with each other. But I bought a JK BMS and it'll arrive soon. It has rs485 connection if it can be beneficial.
[2023-10-18T18:59:31] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: JK BMS is good and wont cause any problems. You cannot connect it to the VESC, but it does not require any connection to anything. :)
[2023-10-18T18:59:59] cihan: Navee measures by voltage, I'm sure. It doesn't have coulomb counter. In fact it's BMS is just for protection, it even doesn't have passive balance.
[2023-10-18T19:00:05] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Good! Then just do not draw too much :)
[2023-10-18T19:00:59] cihan: Navee dashboard shows full for half milage after full recharge. Then it drops fast, only utilizes voltage to show remaining battery.
[2023-10-18T19:02:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Oh and dashboard will not work, you will have to connect front and rear light directly to the VESC.
[2023-10-18T19:02:14] cihan: 1500w is really enough for me. Ninebot f2 pro is 36V and 900W. When battery is over 60%, it accelerates fast enough for me. So I know what 900W is. 1500W is at most I can need when climbing.
[2023-10-18T19:02:38] Gabe Enzo: yeah
[2023-10-18T19:02:59] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes, it is especially mostly the phase current that will make you accelerate much more. These are mostly very low on stock scooters, but 60100HP can push quite a lot.
[2023-10-18T19:03:25] cihan: By the way navee n65 and ninebot f2 pro almost go up at same speed when going uphill so I believed navee n65 is really 900w max.
[2023-10-18T19:03:42] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Oh and if you have not ordered yet and do not mind, might place an order using my link: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DlpQAVv
[2023-10-18T19:04:09] puneDir: is this 20s fine
[2023-10-18T19:04:15] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No, it is up to 13s.
[2023-10-18T19:04:24] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But it uses 100v components. Only limit I noticed is the current measure driver.
[2023-10-18T19:04:39] puneDir: can we mod it to 20s
[2023-10-18T19:04:42] cihan: It's fine for me. I can even totally disable the front light since it's very weak. I use a 1300 lumen light at night's. I also have 2000 lumen light but I cannot install it because navee n65 's own headlight blocks the handlebar. I should better uninstall stock headlight.
[2023-10-18T19:05:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Sure, there are even schematics. :)
[2023-10-18T19:05:17] puneDir: what we need to change for it
[2023-10-18T19:05:37] puneDir: I will buy this lol
[2023-10-18T19:05:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Probably only the current sampling chip. But I cannot 100% tell.
[2023-10-18T19:05:45] cihan: I will
[2023-10-18T19:06:06] puneDir: its better than75100 and cheap
[2023-10-18T19:06:24] cihan: I think 14s will be fine. It tells 13s in product details but it's 60v
[2023-10-18T19:06:37] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes I told someone with 14s to get it as well. There is no reason why it should not support 14s.
[2023-10-18T19:06:50] puneDir: everything should be 20s lol
[2023-10-18T19:07:15] cihan: Even 15s could be fine without problems but I cannot be sure.
[2023-10-18T19:07:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yeah. The sampling chip is up to 70v. They just make sure people wont fry it.
[2023-10-18T19:08:07] puneDir: than why it uses 100v compƒ±nents
[2023-10-18T19:08:12] puneDir: and its for 13s
[2023-10-18T19:08:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I cannot tell. My guess is it is the ESC they worked on as new 75100, but then cheaped out on the sampling chip?
[2023-10-18T19:09:28] puneDir: lol
[2023-10-18T19:09:29] puneDir: Funny
[2023-10-18T19:09:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I talked to them, they still wanted to make a unit like this, but for 20S. But they were disappointed because of not so many sales on the 60100HP and now think people do not care.
[2023-10-18T19:10:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: but that's just stupid, people just don't care if people don't know it exists.
[2023-10-18T19:11:23] puneDir: This esc looks so nice
[2023-10-18T19:11:49] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It does. I would have tried to mod it for 20S, but the caps placement is not good for me.
[2023-10-18T19:12:26] puneDir: Why?
[2023-10-18T19:12:29] puneDir: Its nice place
[2023-10-18T19:12:47] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It makes it more in height. I need more in width for G30.
[2023-10-18T19:12:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But for PRO2 etc perfect
[2023-10-18T19:12:53] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Small af
[2023-10-18T19:15:24] cihan: They have 26 sales. I think people somehow don't want to bother with VESC. even this group consists of 300 people.
[2023-10-18T19:19:49] Mirono escooters: Too low voltage for most
[2023-10-18T19:19:53] Mirono escooters: And too pricey for the v
[2023-10-18T19:20:09] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: üôÑ
[2023-10-18T19:21:07] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: They just had to place INA241 and its fine
[2023-10-18T19:21:30] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: They even said they want to, but eh so far nothing happend.
[2023-10-18T22:04:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Unsure of dimensions but did build navee before ,u could use xiaomi screen, bit smaller Buy adc2 modul and you have all light and other shit you would like
[2023-10-18T22:06:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Even when batt full ? My awd didn't like that ,needed atleast one acceleration to make space
[2023-10-18T22:07:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Same like xiaomi
[2023-10-18T22:08:12] Finn: Obviously if you charge your cells up to 4.20 theres no space
[2023-10-18T22:08:35] Finn: If you set it to like 4.17 it should handle ebrake fine even when "full(4.17)"
[2023-10-18T22:08:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I just answered question Bro
[2023-10-18T22:09:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Near stock bms no option for that
[2023-10-18T22:09:35] Finn: Hm
[2023-10-18T22:09:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also near this i had s65 while he N
[2023-10-18T22:09:54] Finn: Depends on bms versions
[2023-10-18T22:10:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I can only talk about the one i saw
[2023-10-18T22:11:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: S65 similar look like pro ,just bigger 13 s ,bms was dead when i saw it ,cells some 2900 mah ones
[2023-10-18T22:11:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So like 12ah
[2023-10-18T22:18:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Battery looks the same ,but smaller frame, hopefully esc fits lengthwise
[2023-10-18T22:34:42] cihan: Thanks, so were you able to use the dashboard of S65? I will install vesc controller on N65 but I'm not sure if they share similar dashboard.
[2023-10-19T01:02:25] Happy Giraffe: I also put ebrake to always work and vesc to draw until cell is 2.7vüòÖ gotta get home haha Tho I never let it go below 3.2v generally
[2023-10-19T01:04:52] cihan: This ADC Adapter v2 costs me 68 USD, almost same as Makerbase 60100HP. Should I pass it or will it be really beneficial?
[2023-10-19T01:14:26] cihan: I think I don't need dashboard. I'll buy a phone holder and I'll monitor battery voltage from JK BMS app. I don't have turn signals. I'll already uninstall front headlight since it's weak and I'll use a powerful headlight with external battery. It's fine for me if rear light is always on when scooter is on. I want to use stock throttle. I still don't know how to turn off scooter. I'm not sure if I can use the turn off button on stock throttle. I want to use regenerative brake. Do you think that I'll need ADC adapter?
[2023-10-19T01:15:50] cihan: And I don't need speed modes or gear modes. I'll use at same setting all the time.
[2023-10-19T01:16:43] cihan: And I don't have a horn just a bell and it's fine for me.
[2023-10-19T01:18:26] cihan: It's impossible to unplug the battery without a switch, I cannot open the deck. üôÉ
[2023-10-19T01:20:57] cihan: I can benefit from it. How much current does controller draw when it's idle? Is this 3.3V or 5V a setting you adjust from controller or a specification of throttle? Isn't throttle just a potentiometer?
[2023-10-19T01:28:40] cihan: Thank you. I think I'll need to read VESC documentation before making order. I can also need some connectors. I don't really know what connector I'll see when I open the deck. I have plenty of jumper cables for breadboard with different length, both male and female but I don't know if they will stay firm.
[2023-10-19T01:33:59] cihan: I think I can use xt60 connector for battery but I have no idea about phase. Original motor phase cables are not thick probably, 60100HP phase cables are 8AWG as I remember. Somehow I need to attach them each other firmly.
[2023-10-19T01:34:35] cihan: I'm not sure if there's such a crimp with different gauge on both ends.
[2023-10-19T01:43:18] cihan: I'll keep that in mind. You generally crimp the end for high current multi core cables, I didn't know if there were soldered connectors.
[2023-10-19T01:47:55] cihan: Yes, leaded is almost always better as I know except harm for nature, and cheaper.
[2023-10-19T01:58:12] cihan: Thank you for your help, I'm going to sleep, are you from Sweden by the way?
[2023-10-19T01:59:49] cihan: S√∂derstr√∂m seemed so much Swedish, I wasn't wrong.) Have a good night
[2023-10-19T02:58:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I said xiaomi bro

[2023-10-19T03:00:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Fml If there would be any
[2023-10-19T06:08:33] haku: Is it bad for the vesc to trip bms by low voltage? I set mine up to 2.77 it still trips it. The voltage drop is so bad on my battery.
[2023-10-19T06:10:36] haku: Do you guys know if the adc adapter will still need a relay for the turn signals? Or does it automatically shut off?
[2023-10-19T06:17:31] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, depends on bms also but that's usually 2.5v on those non smart ones. If vesc trips battery bms then you have to make vesc cut power and limit power earlier.
[2023-10-19T06:20:30] haku: Happened to me 3 times already while testing vesc. I guess ill just have to stop pushing when i see red on the battery guage.
[2023-10-19T06:21:46] haku: What will it to thes vesc?
[2023-10-19T06:28:23] Happy Giraffe: You see theres two voltage limits for vesc to cutoff power before bms. The first reduces max power and therefore sag. Other option cuts power from vesc completely
[2023-10-19T06:29:03] haku: Gotcha! Thanks bud
[2023-10-19T06:29:54] Happy Giraffe: For example 13s could use something like this if cutoff issues Power reduce 3.2v per cell cutoff completely 3.05v
[2023-10-19T06:41:02] Happy Giraffe: Battery filter I never touched
[2023-10-19T06:42:10] Happy Giraffe: Small numbers make vesc cut off power easier and bigger numbers make it calculate average voltage without noticing the drops that much
[2023-10-19T07:03:52] haku: Ok. These numbers are very conservative. I will try it but i will set the cuttoff end at 2.7v and the start around 3 2.
[2023-10-19T07:04:43] haku: Thanks again!
[2023-10-19T07:56:42] Happy Giraffe: Increase end and start if you still experience it. I would add last 0.05v just to be safe
[2023-10-19T09:09:03] Mo: Hello, I have a 22s 84v 36ah battery I need 2 controllers or 1 dual to power 2x 8000w 120v motors. Any reccomendations and why?
[2023-10-19T09:09:15] Mo: Preferably need to be as slim as possible

[2023-10-19T10:17:35] Finn: Youre on the 3shul level
[2023-10-19T10:38:25] haku: Thats crazy repairing ribbon cables. You must have steady hands
[2023-10-19T10:40:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well ,i would not say this , since they have that,so called antispark swich And that is there solution ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-10-19T10:40:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: They have antispark swich

[2023-10-19T10:50:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Its not a factory solution
[2023-10-19T10:51:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: While you come with your pics and show nothing else ,what should one say ,they will try ?
[2023-10-19T10:52:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Can you explain him the what and how and the why ?
[2023-10-19T10:52:48] NetworkDir: Actually you dont need loops key or more things With mod resistor you simply can turn off or on With shitty volt meter and key Or simple on off key
[2023-10-19T10:52:49] NetworkDir: https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/tools/voltage-divider-calculator/ Calculate your resistor with your voltage R2 resistor 10k ohm
[2023-10-19T10:53:25] haku: Im not really draining it. The voltage drop is so bad on my battery it trips the vesc to shut off. It can drop from 58v down to 48v if i push it hard
[2023-10-19T10:53:27] NetworkDir: Just need soldering skills + 4 pcs resistor and little bit cable
[2023-10-19T10:55:11] haku: But i agree. It is bad
[2023-10-19T10:56:13] Mo: I've heard mixed reviews of 3shul isit good
[2023-10-19T10:57:20] haku: Wait for the new trampa vesc. The specs on that thing is really good too
[2023-10-19T10:57:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Still not a solution, you show blurry pics and a site , with several topics How does this help him ? I mean will a newbie get any closer from this ... I dont think so

[2023-10-19T11:01:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: How much battery A you draw?
[2023-10-19T11:01:58] haku: 45a per side
[2023-10-19T11:02:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So basically 90
[2023-10-19T11:02:20] haku: Its a 90a bms
[2023-10-19T11:02:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You put a new on it?
[2023-10-19T11:02:50] haku: No. It comes like that
[2023-10-19T11:03:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I think ü§î wait
[2023-10-19T11:03:33] haku: Its just a temporary solution till i build me a battery
[2023-10-19T11:04:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I think @VESCSTM has or had the same pack ,drawing 100 A from a same one
[2023-10-19T11:05:10] haku: Dang thats crazy. I dont trust the cells.
[2023-10-19T11:05:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I am Unsure of how much its "rated" But i am sure he made that setting
[2023-10-19T11:06:09] haku: That means the bms is faulty?
[2023-10-19T11:06:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yeah i know why ,but his using it like an year now
[2023-10-19T11:06:43] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ stock contollers would draw like 70a
[2023-10-19T11:07:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So unsure maybe its just not reacting like old school dumb daly ones
[2023-10-19T11:07:49] haku: Yea. I think it peaks at that. But tge stock is 45
[2023-10-19T11:08:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Stock contollers have 35 a marking and has two ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ just saying near that
[2023-10-19T11:17:02] heimdler: magura calipers comes with either 4 piston for front or 2 piston for rear. should i get the one with 4 or 2 pistons? this is for scooter with max speed of 40-50kph
[2023-10-19T11:28:10] Unknown: Most 12v led turn signals have a built in flasher so basically you only need a switch
[2023-10-19T11:28:44] haku: Gotcha. Thanks

[2023-10-19T13:22:00] Mirono escooters: Still some questionable design choices.
[2023-10-19T13:22:03] Mirono escooters: G30 prefer :)
[2023-10-19T13:33:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Mine had lg cells ,not only one type exist or maybe in ox yes
[2023-10-19T13:34:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Same goes for kinda all scooters,its a matter of how you look ,like rear arm part of g30 is a joke ,not mention brake solutions i seeüòÖüôà

For R2 10s-20s works with 100K Resistor . For lower or higher voltages, you should check https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/tools/voltage-divider-calculator/ The output voltage with your lowest voltage should not be below 1.5V, otherwise it will not work For R1 resistor gnd I'm not sure, but I think I had connected it to BE for GND, You can connect to any GND After this, if you give the battery voltage to R2, the vesc will turn on. So you can turn it on and off with any key By @fungus93 :)

[2023-10-19T19:50:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Can‚Äôt you screw?
[2023-10-19T19:50:56] puneDir: I couldnt find screw
[2023-10-19T19:51:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Looks steel nickel
[2023-10-19T19:51:00] puneDir: The holder of that

[2023-10-19T19:51:23] puneDir: Maybe i pushed too much
[2023-10-19T19:54:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: It does spark when you weld?
[2023-10-19T19:54:54] Oreo huzky: I‚Äòm exploring with it vacuum Columbus
[2023-10-19T19:57:49] Oreo huzky: Homeoffice

[2023-10-19T21:25:33] haku: Where do you buy that of you dont mind me asking and does it need a power supply?
[2023-10-19T21:26:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: No, but must connected to 220v , it has supply inside, it‚Äôs capacitor based welder
[2023-10-19T21:26:55] puneDir: Normally yes
[2023-10-19T21:27:01] puneDir: If i put to much small spark but still
[2023-10-19T21:27:06] haku: Nice! Can it sandwich .2 copper?
[2023-10-19T21:27:09] puneDir: But when i touch light huge spark
[2023-10-19T21:31:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: So it‚Äôs probably steel nickel
[2023-10-19T21:32:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Pure nickel don‚Äôt make sparks
[2023-10-19T21:32:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: But u can test as well
[2023-10-19T21:33:53] puneDir: So its bad?
[2023-10-19T21:34:08] puneDir: Imma test the one who comes out from box
[2023-10-19T21:35:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, much worse conductivity
[2023-10-19T21:36:18] puneDir: shit
[2023-10-19T21:37:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: But it‚Äôs so cheap Xd
[2023-10-19T21:37:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Or I mean, is nickel too expensive

[2023-10-19T22:16:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Same thing came up in me too ,also something else It reminded me YT India videos somehow üòÖ when they repair does
[2023-10-19T22:17:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Tig
[2023-10-19T22:17:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not mine, but is the same
[2023-10-19T22:18:06] haku: Does the welds not blow thru?
[2023-10-19T22:18:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Nop
[2023-10-19T22:19:38] haku: Ive never seen this before. Next level stuff not needing steel plated.
[2023-10-19T22:20:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: AVI welder bro
[2023-10-19T22:20:29] haku: How thick is that copper .3?
[2023-10-19T22:21:33] haku: My guess is the copper is thicker not to blow thru
[2023-10-19T22:21:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not mine, I don‚Äôt know
[2023-10-19T22:21:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: U can find it as cold welder
[2023-10-19T22:23:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: From the side of welding, it's kinda nothing for the machine
[2023-10-19T22:25:42] puneDir: <photos/photo_10378@19-10-2023_22-25-42.jpg>
[2023-10-19T22:25:52] puneDir: Lol
[2023-10-19T22:25:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt recommend actually this machine , since it‚Äôs not tested well, only a American company produces reliable machine which is omega pi250 (15-20k‚Ç¨)
[2023-10-19T22:25:55] haku: Does it overheat the cells? Must get really hot
[2023-10-19T22:26:34] haku: Dam lol
[2023-10-19T22:26:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: The author of this video is actually RIP because of house catching fire üòû
[2023-10-19T22:26:40] puneDir: This spotwelder is really nice
[2023-10-19T22:27:15] haku: Very innovative though
[2023-10-19T22:27:24] puneDir: Im able to build battery with stuff that costs 28 euro (battery included)
[2023-10-19T22:27:40] puneDir: Battery fire?
[2023-10-19T22:27:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: True , American avi rocks ,most small ones are like you say
[2023-10-19T22:28:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And car price is good 400 v one , that's kinda why i dont have this at home
[2023-10-19T22:28:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: üòÖüòÖüòÖ
[2023-10-19T22:29:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Not to mention argon or corgon prices
[2023-10-19T22:30:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: This is really sad RIP
[2023-10-19T22:31:38] Mirono escooters: Related to batteries?
[2023-10-19T22:32:58] haku: He died doing what he loves. Only way to go
[2023-10-19T22:33:19] haku: Just joking. Thats pretty terrible
[2023-10-19T22:35:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: Since the language of his family is Cambogia, I don‚Äôt understand well, the translator said it was because he was doing batteries and the whole house catches fire
[2023-10-19T22:35:45] haku: Thats unfortunate.
[2023-10-19T22:36:16] Mirono escooters: Sad
[2023-10-19T22:37:38] cihan: Does anyone use copper strip for batteries? It can rust easily when not galvanized. I read about sandwich method utilizing copper strips but I don't know if it's worth doing that and also if it's durable.
[2023-10-19T22:38:43] haku: I think copper is worth it for high discharge batteries.
[2023-10-19T22:38:58] haku: Ive never done it but im about to try
[2023-10-19T22:39:19] Mirono escooters: Obviously
[2023-10-19T22:39:36] Mirono escooters: Rust? Copper?
[2023-10-19T22:39:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If you leave a clean surface and seal it , nothing bad will happen
[2023-10-19T22:39:55] Mirono escooters: And your battery is sealed Sandwich is widely used. It's best for high current
[2023-10-19T22:39:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Actually yes
[2023-10-19T22:40:03] Mirono escooters: Don't touch it with sweaty hands lol
[2023-10-19T22:40:05] Happy Giraffe: Yeah it's sad that there's risks and tragedies for our hobby. I store my battery on a table that has fire alarm directly on topüòÖ. Also would recommend an insulated steel box for people with multiple batteries
[2023-10-19T22:40:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But much different thing than in iron
[2023-10-19T22:40:11] Mirono escooters: Oxidizes, not rust.
[2023-10-19T22:40:22] haku: Its called patina gents
[2023-10-19T22:40:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Kinda works the other way Around
[2023-10-19T22:40:29] Mirono escooters: ?
[2023-10-19T22:40:48] haku: When copper oxidizes
[2023-10-19T22:40:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Patina is grey or black on copper
[2023-10-19T22:41:05] haku: It turns copper into a greenish hue
[2023-10-19T22:41:06] Mirono escooters: Oh that
[2023-10-19T22:41:14] haku: Like the statue of liberty
[2023-10-19T22:41:15] Mirono escooters: Ya I know that
[2023-10-19T22:41:22] Mirono escooters: But idk how bad your batt is to do that xd
[2023-10-19T22:42:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yep and oxid is build copper thicker
[2023-10-19T22:42:34] puneDir: Lets see what will happen 40ir and 56ir cell in same battery
[2023-10-19T22:42:36] haku: I think there is an effect on current when it oxidizes. Im not sure thougg
[2023-10-19T22:43:49] Mirono escooters: Heck im thick. Its too late, cant read properly
[2023-10-19T22:43:56] Mirono escooters: It shouldn't oxidise in the first place
[2023-10-19T22:44:00] Mirono escooters: Then something else is foktop
[2023-10-19T22:45:10] haku: If its sealed i dont think it will oxidise. Im not tonsure though
[2023-10-19T22:46:20] haku: All the info i get is from youtube scientists.
[2023-10-19T22:46:30] Mirono escooters: Don't touch it with sweaty oily hands
[2023-10-19T22:46:37] Mirono escooters: And if rlly concern coat It with oil
[2023-10-19T22:47:19] haku: There is a coating that should be applied. Ike the copper winds on the hub.
[2023-10-19T22:47:40] Mirono escooters: Not needed, but if you really Want
[2023-10-19T22:49:25] cihan: Yes, it oxidizes.
[2023-10-19T22:50:36] cihan: I thought rusting is same thing as being oxidized, sorry.
[2023-10-19T22:53:33] Paolo ‚Å≠: If battery pack is sealed well, and did in low humidity place, that wouldn‚Äôt be a problem
[2023-10-19T22:53:49] cihan: It effects conductivity, copper oxide is very bad conductive comparing copper.
[2023-10-19T22:55:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs only superficial oxide and is only very tiny layer
[2023-10-19T22:56:09] Mirono escooters: Yes. It stops on its own
[2023-10-19T22:56:14] Mirono escooters: Rust not
[2023-10-19T22:56:40] cihan: Probably, I guess it's a Metter of humidity and acidity. I wouldn't prefer copper for places with 70% or more humidity. On the other hand it could be fine since battery gets warm and never drops below dew point.
[2023-10-19T22:57:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, my ex work place is about 35-40%, they‚Äôve dehumidifier
[2023-10-19T22:58:21] Mirono escooters: Yes is a must
[2023-10-19T22:58:47] Mirono escooters: Copper doesn't oxidise like that randomly. It needs enough factors to even start
[2023-10-19T22:58:56] Mirono escooters: My copper roll has been laying here for months
[2023-10-19T22:58:59] cihan: I've seen heavily oxidized copper a few times. It develops furthermore into the metal. It doesn't stay on surface like aluminum, aluminum oxidizes so fast but oxygen cannot penetrate inside aluminum oxide once surface is oxidized. Maybe it's related with purity of copper. I'm not sure if oxygen can penetrate inside copper molecules.

[2023-10-19T22:59:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_10380@19-10-2023_22-59-06.jpg>
[2023-10-19T22:59:23] Mirono escooters: That's just impossible. Or very heavy factors
[2023-10-19T22:59:29] Mirono escooters: Copper oxidation is on surface
[2023-10-19T22:59:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs my first time doing battery, I had a humidifier in the room, was about 87-90%üôàüôà
[2023-10-19T23:00:45] Dimitar: Just keep the battery in a bucket of WD-40
[2023-10-19T23:00:49] Dimitar: üòÇüòÇ
[2023-10-19T23:00:51] Finn: Nickel plated steel?
[2023-10-19T23:01:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, I was stupid af
[2023-10-19T23:01:45] Paolo ‚Å≠: U get experience doing a lot of battery
[2023-10-19T23:01:51] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2023-10-19T23:01:54] Finn: Yes
[2023-10-19T23:02:06] Finn: My first battery had heat wrap but you could see the cellsüòÇ
[2023-10-19T23:02:24] Finn: Also no protection at all from moisture or anything
[2023-10-19T23:02:27] Mirono escooters: Clear wrap? :)
[2023-10-19T23:02:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: What‚Äôs the problem with clear wrap
[2023-10-19T23:02:38] Finn: Nah black wrap
[2023-10-19T23:03:25] haku: Capton tape should be fine right? Does it still penetrate?
[2023-10-19T23:03:26] Mirono escooters: Nothing
[2023-10-19T23:03:33] Mirono escooters: Well, pvc seals
[2023-10-19T23:03:38] Mirono escooters: Kapton impossible to fullyairseal
[2023-10-19T23:03:44] Mirono escooters: Pvc wrap and silicon!
[2023-10-19T23:03:58] Mirono escooters: I do every batt like that now
[2023-10-19T23:04:22] haku: I bought a clear shrink wrap for my battery build
[2023-10-19T23:04:59] haku: Just to see whats going on in there
[2023-10-19T23:06:20] cihan: How does battery cool when you seal it airtight?
[2023-10-19T23:06:55] Mirono escooters: Passively
[2023-10-19T23:07:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: Like motor
[2023-10-19T23:07:12] Mirono escooters: Through all of the stuff Airtight or not, it's not like air moves inside
[2023-10-19T23:07:15] Mirono escooters: It's fine
[2023-10-19T23:07:37] puneDir: That looks bad man
[2023-10-19T23:08:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: Very old battery
[2023-10-19T23:08:16] Mirono escooters: No shit Sherlock
[2023-10-19T23:08:24] puneDir: Lol
[2023-10-19T23:10:04] haku: How long does it take for plated steel rust like that?
[2023-10-19T23:11:04] Mirono escooters: Can be 2 mins with salt water Can be never if you Build it well
[2023-10-19T23:11:46] puneDir: My nickel strip says nickel plated steel
[2023-10-19T23:11:53] puneDir: Or opposite
[2023-10-19T23:12:08] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2023-10-19T23:12:45] puneDir: Is there so much difference between 50 and 60h motor?
[2023-10-19T23:15:01] Mirono escooters: 1/6 ;0
[2023-10-19T23:15:17] puneDir: oh
[2023-10-19T23:15:34] puneDir: So dual 30h kinda same to single 60h
[2023-10-19T23:15:39] Mirono escooters: (i have no idea, but seems Mathematically logical)
[2023-10-19T23:15:56] Mirono escooters: Altough circle, heat cap wise Hm
[2023-10-19T23:16:16] puneDir: i can only get 2x 50h
[2023-10-19T23:17:00] Mirono escooters: Good enough
[2023-10-19T23:18:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: Two motor is always more efficient
[2023-10-19T23:18:52] puneDir: even dual 30h is nice
[2023-10-19T23:19:46] cihan: Does motor efficiency decrease with high current?
[2023-10-19T23:20:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yea
[2023-10-19T23:20:48] cihan: I mean efficasy probably.)
[2023-10-19T23:30:42] haku: Is it common to brick a vesc? How does that happen?
[2023-10-19T23:48:51] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-10-19T23:48:52] Mirono escooters: Skill issue usually :)
[2023-10-19T23:53:43] haku: Can always reflash it right?
[2023-10-20T00:05:07] cihan: I feel like I'll be skillful once I get the vesc controller.)
[2023-10-20T00:09:46] Gabe Enzo: Lithium battery bunker.
[2023-10-20T00:09:49] cihan: Today I connected the poles of the battery inversely to the inverter, I don't know how I could do that, fortunately I just touched for less than 1/10 of a second and nothing seems to be broken for now. I wanted to touch before permanent connection to test if it would spark and it did.)
[2023-10-20T00:10:21] Gabe Enzo: What inverter
[2023-10-20T00:11:45] cihan: A cheap Chinese sine wave inverter. It's 2000W Excellway from Banggood. It coated me 27 USD in total. It's continuous power is 800W actually.
[2023-10-20T00:12:29] Gabe Enzo: 2000w should be the continuous.
[2023-10-20T00:12:33] cihan: Victron had precharge and doesn't spark.
[2023-10-20T00:12:33] Gabe Enzo: cause it's sold as 2kw
[2023-10-20T00:12:59] Gabe Enzo: why are you plugging an inverter into a battery anyways
[2023-10-20T00:13:02] cihan: They always declare max for cheap Chinese ones, you find the continuous power in item details.
[2023-10-20T00:14:04] cihan: I just connected the 12V battery to it as usual. It's not something related with scooter. I wanted to tell how skillful I could be once I get a VESC controller.)
[2023-10-20T00:15:00] Gabe Enzo: Takes more skill to keep a non vesc controller running. haven't gotten mine but I can assume less headache.
[2023-10-20T00:15:14] Gabe Enzo: I'm getting mine v soon.
[2023-10-20T00:15:54] cihan: Maybe, the ones I had didn't have problems yet. By the way I'm surprised that inverter didn't blow fuse. It has input fuse but no parallel diode.
[2023-10-20T00:16:11] Gabe Enzo: What is the inverter for.
[2023-10-20T00:16:30] Gabe Enzo: Powerwall?
[2023-10-20T00:17:03] Gabe Enzo: Battery BMS Saved you
[2023-10-20T00:17:29] cihan: I probably touched too short to blow the fuse. No, I have an aunt with tracheostomy and I drive her to doctor /hospital in capital time to time. I run the ventilator and sometimes oxygen generator from inverter on the road.
[2023-10-20T00:17:53] Gabe Enzo: haha "too short" they're little flying balls of subatomic particles
[2023-10-20T00:18:14] Mirono escooters: Mmm? Some China Escs are so simple and robust. Vesc more finnicky.
[2023-10-20T00:18:35] Gabe Enzo: I was implying xiaotrash
[2023-10-20T00:18:50] Mirono escooters: ü§∑
[2023-10-20T00:19:12] cihan: BMS used to cut power only once when I was riding. I didn't have enough charge and used battery to the limits and it cut riding uphill.
[2023-10-20T00:19:32] Gabe Enzo: You would've fried the Inverter
[2023-10-20T00:19:49] Gabe Enzo: BMS still has short circuit protection
[2023-10-20T00:20:00] Gabe Enzo: and reverse polarity protection
[2023-10-20T00:20:13] cihan: I didn't have any problems with navee n65 ESC yet but there are people who burned mosfet or voltage comparator but it's rare.
[2023-10-20T00:20:54] Gabe Enzo: by the way you got another?
[2023-10-20T00:21:03] Gabe Enzo: killed my mom's esc
[2023-10-20T00:21:04] cihan: Yes but I didn't have BMS for the invertor today. I connected it directly to a lead acid battery.
[2023-10-20T00:21:14] Mirono escooters: No, it doesn't
[2023-10-20T00:21:24] Mirono escooters: Reverse polarity usually results in short circuit
[2023-10-20T00:21:36] Gabe Enzo: A good deal of Chinese inverters have the protection.
[2023-10-20T00:21:36] Mirono escooters: Idk how it would detect reverse polarity xD
[2023-10-20T00:21:43] Gabe Enzo: I implied haha
[2023-10-20T00:21:48] Gabe Enzo: but ye they the same
[2023-10-20T00:21:53] Mirono escooters: The bang good cheap ones? You wish.
[2023-10-20T00:22:02] Gabe Enzo: I mean the Amazon haha
[2023-10-20T00:22:04] cihan: They do but rarely and they aren't cheap.
[2023-10-20T00:22:07] Mirono escooters: They have a diode to trigger overcurrent protection. That's all.
[2023-10-20T00:22:39] cihan: Mine doesn't have diode, at least I couldn't see it when I opened to check if I fried something inside.
[2023-10-20T00:23:11] Mirono escooters: If you connect it the other way, you short circuit it, and hopefully trigger a fuse. That's it. that's their protection lol
[2023-10-20T00:23:23] Mirono escooters: Even worse
[2023-10-20T00:23:44] Gabe Enzo: when you can't see blown things that means it's worse
[2023-10-20T00:23:54] Gabe Enzo: usually
[2023-10-20T00:23:56] Gabe Enzo: Lmfao
[2023-10-20T00:24:01] cihan: Yes, I already bought a Victron before to be safe and bought this cheap one since it was cheap.)
[2023-10-20T00:24:23] Mirono escooters: Heh, fun to mess around with.
[2023-10-20T00:24:31] cihan: Yes, means no protection and don't know what happened to the silicon inside.)
[2023-10-20T00:24:34] Gabe Enzo: lol what is the arrow there. a led?
[2023-10-20T00:24:38] Mirono escooters: Doubt it's sinus
[2023-10-20T00:24:46] Mirono escooters: ???? Diode??? üòÖüòÖ
[2023-10-20T00:24:54] Mirono escooters: That's like basic electronics symbol
[2023-10-20T00:24:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I was thinking on that fire , Like what could have gone wrong, and you really rely on the cell thickness ,while tig/avi always sends the power Always ü§î
[2023-10-20T00:25:24] Gabe Enzo: I'm not good at electronics, I only have surface knowledge and muh brushless and li ion cool
[2023-10-20T00:25:26] Mirono escooters: Blew through, lithium everywhere? Lithium no fun exposed to air
[2023-10-20T00:25:31] cihan: It's sinus, someone measured it before. However quality also differs a lot within same brand name, higher power ones cost much more and have better cooling /protection.
[2023-10-20T00:25:35] Mirono escooters: Symbols great way to start
[2023-10-20T00:26:00] Mirono escooters: Lucky u
[2023-10-20T00:27:08] cihan: I wouldn't prefer if it wasn't sine since I'm running a pump inside oxygen generator. I tried that oxygen generator with a modified sine before and didn't work.
[2023-10-20T00:27:25] Gabe Enzo: Wtf
[2023-10-20T00:28:12] Gabe Enzo: you should never put non sine into precise equipment like that ever
[2023-10-20T00:28:22] Gabe Enzo: > mod sine wave Oop
[2023-10-20T00:29:00] Gabe Enzo: Kinda ya kinda na
[2023-10-20T00:29:21] cihan: I cannot consider it precise. It's also a Chinese oxygen generator and it's simple, in fact it's a nitrogen filter. It removes nitrogen from air and the air becomes almost pure oxygen.
[2023-10-20T00:29:48] Gabe Enzo: it is true you get more Efficiently per km but the initial Efficiency drops when the windings get overheated
[2023-10-20T00:30:06] Gabe Enzo: Motors should never be allowed to intake box wave.
[2023-10-20T00:30:13] Gabe Enzo: they die.
[2023-10-20T00:30:18] cihan: Precise one is ventilator which costs much more and it's like M1 Abrams tank, it uses whatever electricity you feed into it.)
[2023-10-20T00:31:34] cihan: I tried for like 5-6 seconds and heard it wasn't running properly and disconnected.
[2023-10-20T00:31:47] Gabe Enzo: Yeah the motors can't take it
[2023-10-20T00:31:53] Gabe Enzo: whose this machine for anyways?
[2023-10-20T00:33:24] cihan: On the other hand ventilator has a very good power supply of its own so it can run 12V/24V/120V/230V sine, square whatever you feed into it.) and very resilient to voltage fluctuations too.
[2023-10-20T00:33:35] cihan: Oxygen generator and ventilator?
[2023-10-20T00:33:41] Gabe Enzo: Ye
[2023-10-20T00:35:09] cihan: My aunt uses them. She has tracheostomy and cannot breathe enough herself. In fact she inspires well but cannot expire well. Without ventilator and oxygen generator carbondioxide in her blood increases and at one point she goes unconscious.
[2023-10-20T00:36:07] Happy Giraffe: Yeah I'm gonna do one for my batt, 3mm steel so not gonna burn through it anytime soonüòÖ
[2023-10-20T00:36:37] cihan: We visited more than 30 doctors, whole professors, 3 hospitals but they couldn't diognise the problem.
[2023-10-20T00:38:56] cihan: You use steel strips for battery connection?
[2023-10-20T00:39:54] Gabe Enzo: my mom has a respiratory disease called bronchitis and it took doctors years to diagnose.
[2023-10-20T00:40:21] Gabe Enzo: yeah it's a big struggle.
[2023-10-20T00:47:30] Mirono escooters: Housing/ box lol
[2023-10-20T01:14:58] Happy Giraffe: Charging box so house is protected if anything happens. Its older battery now, soon 4 years so I wanna be safeüòÖ
[2023-10-20T01:18:17] haku: When you guys use lipo to power your spot welders what precautions do you guys take?
[2023-10-20T01:24:28] Happy Giraffe: Yeah with a lid so if fire happens it wont get that much extra oxygen
[2023-10-20T01:25:24] Happy Giraffe: I wish they made a small, waterproof mountable charger fore-vehicles. 2A would be fine. Could just carry the ac plug with you
[2023-10-20T01:25:37] NetworkDir: Yeah
[2023-10-20T01:25:41] Happy Giraffe: Yeah but I guess it burns much stronger when access
[2023-10-20T01:25:55] NetworkDir: It‚Äôs just burn and smoke
[2023-10-20T01:26:34] Happy Giraffe: Hmm, anyway 3mm steel should do itüòÇ
[2023-10-20T01:26:39] haku: Isnt it your suppose to let the battery vent not keep it in a air tight container?
[2023-10-20T01:27:26] haku: If its fully sealed doesnt it blow up?
[2023-10-20T01:27:31] Happy Giraffe: Small holes will be must to pass cables. I charge it show enough for it not to heat. Also if metal case it will dissipate heat
[2023-10-20T01:28:59] Happy Giraffe: I got two of my stools broken in one day. Next one will have upto 6mm steel plate as construction elementüòÇ

[2023-10-20T01:30:26] Happy Giraffe: To extinguish a lithium fire you gotta freeze the pack. Hard when 10kg of tnt equivalent material is set to flamesüòÇ
[2023-10-20T01:31:00] NetworkDir: For lithum batterys fire extinguisher available but too expensive
[2023-10-20T01:31:36] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_10383@20-10-2023_01-31-36.jpg>
[2023-10-20T01:31:43] haku: Keep it in a barbeque grill is a good idea too i guess
[2023-10-20T01:32:23] NetworkDir: Maybe
[2023-10-20T01:32:47] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_10384@20-10-2023_01-32-47.jpg>
[2023-10-20T01:32:49] NetworkDir: XD
[2023-10-20T01:33:15] NetworkDir: I hope this bms with shitty used bak cells don‚Äôt make fire
[2023-10-20T01:34:51] haku: Ive made a 12v pack with no bms. From recycled cells. Bak cells havr good reviews i think.
[2023-10-20T01:35:27] haku: Its just for lighting up leds
[2023-10-20T01:35:37] NetworkDir: But i used at my dmgec cells Balance and .. good i dont have any problems Maybe its better than shit daly bms
[2023-10-20T01:35:55] Happy Giraffe: Oh wow
[2023-10-20T01:35:58] haku: I was ignorant back then
[2023-10-20T01:36:16] haku: Yes. With a b6 lipo charger

[2023-10-20T01:37:00] Happy Giraffe: But if its made to be stored inside why no lifepo4 cells that are already 12v?ü§î
[2023-10-20T01:37:02] haku: I really did not know what i was doing.
[2023-10-20T01:37:16] Happy Giraffe: Then also never gonna catch fire
[2023-10-20T01:38:31] Happy Giraffe: 4.175v for balancing. Oof you definitely gonna need CC-CV charger
[2023-10-20T01:38:48] Happy Giraffe: Lifepo?
[2023-10-20T01:38:55] NetworkDir: Yeah my chargers cc-cv probably
[2023-10-20T01:39:16] Happy Giraffe: If not the bms will never balanceüòÅ
[2023-10-20T01:39:34] NetworkDir: 14s7p with 30-40 internal resistance bak cells should fine for 30A XD
[2023-10-20T01:39:40] NetworkDir: üëç
[2023-10-20T01:39:58] Happy Giraffe: Or maybe if left on charger when full
[2023-10-20T01:41:09] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_10387@20-10-2023_01-41-09.jpg>
[2023-10-20T01:41:43] NetworkDir: Stock charger (2A) + shitty Chinese (3A)
[2023-10-20T01:42:02] NetworkDir: For 47Ah i must purchase Cc-CV 10A
[2023-10-20T01:42:04] NetworkDir: XD
[2023-10-20T01:44:38] NetworkDir: Looks good
[2023-10-20T01:44:48] NetworkDir: But idk it‚Äôs cc cv or not
[2023-10-20T01:45:07] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_10389@20-10-2023_01-45-07.jpg>
[2023-10-20T01:45:12] NetworkDir: Yep good
[2023-10-20T01:49:01] Happy Giraffe: Because without CC-CV it wont charge battery full
[2023-10-20T01:49:27] Happy Giraffe: Other way is to use a proper active balance smart bms
[2023-10-20T01:49:55] Happy Giraffe: Then it wont matter that much and you can charge to 95% to enjoy 2x cell life
[2023-10-20T01:50:04] NetworkDir: Yes maybe with leaving at charge it‚Äôs full charge But no problem i purchase cc cv charger
[2023-10-20T01:50:25] NetworkDir: Already this cell life fucked up Dont manter
[2023-10-20T01:51:24] NetworkDir: Putting smart bms for this cells not worth it
[2023-10-20T01:52:07] NetworkDir: After 1 years All cells trash and with brand new 21700 cells + smart bms replace
[2023-10-20T02:00:29] haku: Why is jk bms more superior to ant bms?
[2023-10-20T02:01:03] haku: Is there a big difference in performance? App?
[2023-10-20T02:21:34] haku: I shouldve asked here first before buying parts. I can always change it in the future
[2023-10-20T02:51:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: Passive of ant is faster
[2023-10-20T02:58:23] haku: But is ant relaible? Just want to make sure.
[2023-10-20T03:11:25] haku: Like the app will always work. Ive heard the old ones have a hard time connecting to app
[2023-10-20T06:12:48] haku: Anyone know if i wire 2 headlights in parrallel on a spintend adc adapter. Will it work. The lights are 12v 18w led headlights.
[2023-10-20T06:32:31] Happy Giraffe: 12v3a is lot to pull from same output
[2023-10-20T06:33:01] Happy Giraffe: It's also the max for most aux dc
[2023-10-20T06:47:14] Happy Giraffe: For higher power dc-dc converter is nice. Then you dont run components near their limits and can add additional 12v peripherals like phone quick charger
[2023-10-20T06:54:28] haku: What small dc-dc would you recommend?
[2023-10-20T06:54:42] haku: Space is very limited
[2023-10-20T06:55:24] francois schempers: you have quite small ones on Aliexpress, what's you're battery voltage range ?
[2023-10-20T06:56:06] haku: Right now max 67. But i want something that can run 72v in the future
[2023-10-20T06:58:29] haku: Ill check on aliexpress. Most of those have a big heatsink though
[2023-10-20T07:01:32] haku: 2 of these lights i want in parrallel. Right now i only have 1 connected to the adc adapter Just found this amazing item on AliExpress.

[2023-10-20T07:05:40] Happy Giraffe: Whats the purpose of these lights?
[2023-10-20T07:06:01] haku: Just as headlights.
[2023-10-20T07:06:40] Happy Giraffe: The light beam of these will be bad and will blind everyone coming against you. Possibly very dangerousüòÖ

[2023-10-20T07:09:12] haku: Thats nice! A little pricey for a light but i will consider it
[2023-10-20T07:10:20] Happy Giraffe: This is very cheap, on a dark rainy day you won't do anything with a bad light pattern. Honestly most of chinalights should be banned from road useüòÖ Cars or others cant see anything when you ride towards them
[2023-10-20T07:11:23] Happy Giraffe: I have 18w chinese light with a focused beam, its quite nice but wastes bit of power compared to this magicshine etc
[2023-10-20T07:12:10] haku: Lol thats true for some. Even on stock scooters its so bad. But this one i bought it doesnt blind people/ cars. Ive tested it

[2023-10-20T10:33:52] Happy Giraffe: Just buy new batteryüòÅ
[2023-10-20T10:34:24] heimdler: Unfortunately I'm too deep into it already, when I found another seller it was too late
[2023-10-20T10:44:01] Happy Giraffe: 1S also a frame not really worth upgrading
[2023-10-20T10:46:37] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Pro better
[2023-10-20T10:46:51] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: But g30 more better
[2023-10-20T11:07:19] Mirono escooters: More price
[2023-10-20T11:07:22] Gabe Enzo: Guys have we not learned after these years that everything is a pile of burning dog shit unless it's absolutely modified
[2023-10-20T11:07:29] Gabe Enzo: The frame is the best
[2023-10-20T11:07:32] Gabe Enzo: that's all
[2023-10-20T11:07:35] Gabe Enzo: all ninebot shit goes in trash

[2023-10-20T11:11:50] Gabe Enzo: same with the 1s haha
[2023-10-20T11:12:22] Gabe Enzo: I had faith in the pro motors until the incident last week
[2023-10-20T11:12:45] Gabe Enzo: I'm finishing this 300w off and then buying a Paolo motor.
[2023-10-20T11:55:12] Mirono escooters: Yeh
[2023-10-20T11:55:13] Mirono escooters: Best
[2023-10-20T11:55:23] Mirono escooters: You know pro motors better then 1s riight?...
[2023-10-20T12:22:14] Happy Giraffe: G30 is niceüòÖ
[2023-10-20T12:28:30] Gabe Enzo: I have to admit, it is the best premade scooter you can get. I'd go back in time and buy the G30 in a heartbeat instead. but ATM I am hunting for a frame
[2023-10-20T12:28:56] Gabe Enzo: Kugoo is so shit
[2023-10-20T12:38:11] Mirono escooters: Yeh
[2023-10-20T12:38:27] Mirono escooters: People saying it's expensive. But, it's build so well. The more you dissasemble it, the more you love ir
[2023-10-20T12:38:53] Mirono escooters: Even the smol rubber piece for throttle and brake wire, beautiful The routing of rear led, great The wiring inside, well thought out
[2023-10-20T12:39:01] Mirono escooters: It's just , good.
[2023-10-20T12:39:13] Mirono escooters: Can't wait to finish mine. Just waiting for plugs.
[2023-10-20T12:44:50] Santiago: Kugoo xd
[2023-10-20T12:45:13] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: G3 moment
[2023-10-20T12:50:19] Gabe Enzo: hope those scooters never get Mainstream
[2023-10-20T12:50:49] Gabe Enzo: I can imagine a dude coming to my shop, like "yo bro can you fix my kugoo stem' fuck off.
[2023-10-20T12:53:45] francois schempers: go for max g2 then ! honestly, really good for the price
[2023-10-20T12:54:34] Gabe Enzo: does anyone know of this components name
[2023-10-20T13:22:39] Santiago: Not in English
[2023-10-20T13:22:55] Santiago: I can tell u in Spanish xD
[2023-10-20T13:34:59] Gabe Enzo: sure
[2023-10-20T13:38:52] Nick: Any good xt90 charging solutions you guys can recommend off of AliExpress for 72v? Doesn't have to be fast charger but there's a million different things so idk what to choose
[2023-10-20T13:39:19] Nick: Looking for xt90 to charge port and then a charger that matches
[2023-10-20T13:41:31] Happy Giraffe: Stem
[2023-10-20T13:41:50] Gabe Enzo: It's a pro 2 stem with MTB handlebars.
[2023-10-20T13:41:57] Gabe Enzo: 32.7
[2023-10-20T13:42:07] Happy Giraffe: I would honestly pick best charger and solder xt90 antispark there
[2023-10-20T13:42:34] Gabe Enzo: You'll never get a good charger unless you make your own connector
[2023-10-20T13:42:41] Nick: So just a straight power outlet to box to xt90?
[2023-10-20T13:42:46] Gabe Enzo: Yes
[2023-10-20T13:42:48] Gabe Enzo: Lmfao
[2023-10-20T13:43:01] Gabe Enzo: well not power outlet
[2023-10-20T13:43:05] Gabe Enzo: you still need like a charger
[2023-10-20T13:43:08] Happy Giraffe: I mean , wall-charger-xt90üòÖ
[2023-10-20T13:43:13] Nick: Can a xt90 handle being plugged and unplugged a bunch of times?
[2023-10-20T13:43:18] Nick: Like over a few years
[2023-10-20T13:43:24] Gabe Enzo: Yeah
[2023-10-20T13:43:36] Gabe Enzo: I still have xt90s from 7 years ago
[2023-10-20T13:43:38] Gabe Enzo: good as new lol
[2023-10-20T13:43:56] Happy Giraffe: Yes and if you want you can make an adapter and then switch that. Or once in 5 years change the plug lol
[2023-10-20T13:44:16] Gabe Enzo: prob have another evehicle by then anyways
[2023-10-20T13:44:19] Nick: In that case I have the old charger already and it's a 72v so I could just do that now if it won't blow up.
[2023-10-20T13:44:26] Gabe Enzo: Yea
[2023-10-20T13:44:29] Gabe Enzo: it's fine
[2023-10-20T13:44:43] Nick: I figured there would just be whole charging solutions though since escooter parts are on ali
[2023-10-20T13:44:54] Gabe Enzo: Let the charger box discharge first
[2023-10-20T13:45:54] Nick: It's been hanging on a chair for a year it's probably super dead. Idk though I kinda want a charging port so I don't have to pull a nappy yellow connector out of my bikes battery box when I have to charge lmao
[2023-10-20T13:46:32] Happy Giraffe: Btw if anyone needs a good out of the box 3D printer for smaller 180x180 parts this is insane valua and speed. Auto leveling and calibration so very newbie friendly
[2023-10-20T13:46:35] Happy Giraffe: https://youtu.be/fiuayM_ipeE?si=6Mey1Atmxh8h-_de
[2023-10-20T13:48:23] Happy Giraffe: I have the mounted versions of the xt90. Male plug gets bolted iex scooter frame. This port would definitely need fuse. I think they are better charging ports available for vehicle use
[2023-10-20T13:48:56] Happy Giraffe: https://electricboardsolutions.com/products/cnlinko-10a-dc-port
[2023-10-20T13:49:09] Nick: I have 2x xt90 fuses rated for 120a was gonna use one for discharge could use other one for charge
[2023-10-20T13:50:37] Happy Giraffe: No, for charge fuse you put it to the wire
[2023-10-20T13:50:54] Happy Giraffe: And if charger is 5A then fuse will be 8-10A
[2023-10-20T13:51:04] Happy Giraffe: Otherwise it blows up too slow
[2023-10-20T13:52:12] Nick: Actually I think my battery already has it
[2023-10-20T13:53:25] Nick: I was the guy on here like 2 months ago with QS8 discharge and xt90 charge with a fuse on it so I guess I just need to have a male plug on the end of the charger and I'm good
[2023-10-20T13:56:02] Jan: Lol xt90 for charging? ^^
[2023-10-20T13:56:27] Jan: You plan 7.5kW charge rates?
[2023-10-20T14:04:39] Gabe Enzo: simplicity
[2023-10-20T14:04:46] Gabe Enzo: I'd rather go with a giant plug tho haha
[2023-10-20T14:04:53] Gabe Enzo: that going into a frame would look beast.
[2023-10-20T14:18:47] Mirono escooters: Except fork xD
[2023-10-20T14:19:20] Mirono escooters: I'd think it looks totally ugly
[2023-10-20T14:19:25] Mirono escooters: Personal preference ig
[2023-10-20T14:19:28] Mirono escooters: And if wanna show off xD
[2023-10-20T14:30:54] Gabe Enzo: G30 + dual monorim = üòòüíç
[2023-10-20T14:40:42] Zak: Qs8 is discharge
[2023-10-20T14:41:08] Zak: I prefer x90 for antispark on charger also
[2023-10-20T14:41:14] Zak: Xt90
[2023-10-20T14:50:52] Mirono escooters: Monoshit

[2023-10-20T16:18:36] Mirono escooters: Prefer XLR connecto
[2023-10-20T18:01:14] Face de Pin Suc√©: We use XT90 for charging too, because XT60 heats too much at 45-50A charging
[2023-10-20T18:07:04] francois schempers: well if it heats up, it become waterproof, and if it's not waterproof, then if was not hot enough üòÇüòÇ
[2023-10-20T18:13:19] Gabe Enzo: Why would you ever wanna charge a 50ah batt with 50ah
[2023-10-20T18:13:26] Gabe Enzo: that number is way too high
[2023-10-20T18:13:44] Gabe Enzo: You mean discharge.
[2023-10-20T18:16:17] Mirono escooters: A*
[2023-10-20T18:16:24] Mirono escooters: And why not, fast charge
[2023-10-20T18:16:30] Mirono escooters: He knows what he does lol
[2023-10-20T18:48:19] Happy Giraffe: For that I would get QS-8üòÇ

[2023-10-20T23:17:08] puneDir: <photos/photo_10392@20-10-2023_23-17-08.jpg>
[2023-10-20T23:17:13] puneDir: Is this v1 or v2
[2023-10-20T23:17:30] Mirono escooters: 3 stacked shunts is v2
[2023-10-20T23:17:42] puneDir: Oh thx
[2023-10-20T23:17:50] puneDir: Flipsky 75100 v2 fw to it
[2023-10-20T23:17:58] NetworkDir: Yes
[2023-10-20T23:22:17] Happy Giraffe: Nah, western people are just greedy
[2023-10-20T23:22:56] Mirono escooters: Sure
[2023-10-20T23:22:58] Happy Giraffe: Companies in Finland sold to Asia even when they made lots of profit and employed hundreds of people. Wasn't profitable "enough"
[2023-10-20T23:23:04] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-10-20T23:23:10] Mirono escooters: Running a business is expensive af. And with the limited market..
[2023-10-20T23:23:19] Mirono escooters: Rion/ tronic have advantage of putting it inside their scoots
[2023-10-20T23:23:59] Happy Giraffe: Yup, I was talking more in general. But I have no issues buying from china, fuck western greed
[2023-10-20T23:24:05] Mirono escooters: A big company wich is listed on stock exchange is something COMPLETELY different Then you have shareholders demanding and what not
[2023-10-20T23:24:13] Mirono escooters: We are compatible apples and pears. Not worth the discussion
[2023-10-20T23:24:28] Mirono escooters: Ah then I can agree, yes. If we generalise it..
[2023-10-20T23:24:42] Mirono escooters: Especially reselling lol. Pay middle man
[2023-10-20T23:26:06] Happy Giraffe: Yup, people would actually have jobs and unemployment so much less but yeah thats todays worldüòÅ
[2023-10-20T23:26:19] haku: I like china prices but western components.
[2023-10-20T23:26:52] Mirono escooters: Eh, our system is rigged But that's not this groups subject
[2023-10-20T23:34:40] Happy Giraffe: It was just a small rant of us wanting to buy west techüòÅ
[2023-10-20T23:34:41] Gabe Enzo: niche market is a killer.
[2023-10-20T23:35:24] Gabe Enzo: hear this. both of you are correct
[2023-10-20T23:47:23] Mirono escooters: Back to vesc
[2023-10-20T23:48:56] Gabe Enzo: back to the future
[2023-10-20T23:55:07] Happy Giraffe: Anyone have a good cell fitting calculator for messing around with battery shapes?
[2023-10-20T23:55:10] Happy Giraffe: https://eu.nkon.nl/rechargeable/lifepo4/prismatisch/eve-c40-40135-20ah-3-2v.html
[2023-10-20T23:55:23] Happy Giraffe: This would be a fun cell to do 20s2p
[2023-10-20T23:57:02] Gabe Enzo: pen and paper kek
[2023-10-21T00:14:22] haku: http://functionmaker.com:3000
[2023-10-21T00:14:38] haku: Works on pc only
[2023-10-21T00:18:58] Unknown: Put phone on desktop mode it works. Three dots in top left "kabab" then choose desktop
[2023-10-21T00:22:27] Mirono escooters: SolidWorks sketch and brain xs
[2023-10-21T00:27:50] haku: Thanks.
[2023-10-21T04:05:12] Happy Giraffe: SolidworksüíÄ
[2023-10-21T05:30:44] haku: https://youtu.be/uL9cdOFoTFw?si=zwTjaoy2LQ7Ckdxv
[2023-10-21T05:30:45] haku: This guy has a qs723 72v molicels and a fardriver on a mtb frame. Pretty impressive of you ask me
[2023-10-21T05:31:49] haku: Would be better if it was vesc
[2023-10-21T06:11:04] Happy Giraffe: He doesnt run much power I suppose. Duct tape battery and non-tightening torque armsüòÖ
[2023-10-21T06:12:28] Happy Giraffe: I'm not hating on him but why make a video "should you get X motor?" If you only run it 20% of the power
[2023-10-21T06:17:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's always low power people that makes videos of "how to blablabla"
[2023-10-21T06:30:05] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I can also say Mxus is nice blabla but I never pushed it past 2000w so I have no idea whats it capable of with a stronger battery. And how can you improve it with hubsinks etc etc. Today with internet too many people without any proper skills do these "influencer" videos is stupidüôà
[2023-10-21T06:36:09] haku: Im just impressed that his dropouts still intact. I also like builds like this cheap frame but premium components
[2023-10-21T06:36:45] haku: Well fardriver is not really premium i guess.
[2023-10-21T06:39:26] haku: Also for direct drive hubs. Why are there only few options. Its all qs
[2023-10-21T06:43:33] Happy Giraffe: Frame might be steel idk about these chinabikes. Thats why its still aliveüòÅ but for that power a mid drive like bafang ultra would move bike faster
[2023-10-21T06:44:24] Happy Giraffe: Saw KiloVolt youtube channel use them for their QSmotors. I havent done any reaearch on them but they should do the job.
[2023-10-21T06:46:15] haku: Yea midrive is the way if offroad. Or faster acceleration.
[2023-10-21T06:47:17] haku: Im not an expert. This is coming from youtube university
[2023-10-21T10:02:47] Mirono escooters: Waa
[2023-10-21T12:17:04] Gabe Enzo: Almost 2 weeks and still no ubox ü´•
[2023-10-21T12:17:20] Gabe Enzo: straight from china
[2023-10-21T12:17:35] Gabe Enzo: definitely getting off James next time üíÄ
[2023-10-21T13:55:59] Pandalgns: Hello, I wanted to send you a video (I speak in Spanish) and some photos of the project I am doing for my Xiaomi Dual, they are the new supports with a cooling tunnel and aluminum heatsinks for the markerbase 75100 that I am going to mount on my Xiaomi, it fits finish some details such as support holes and cable passage but it would be almost ready, it will go on a xiaomi pro with a 40mm extender
[2023-10-21T13:56:26] Gabe Enzo: 40mm is too much. 32mm has barely any clearance.
[2023-10-21T13:56:36] Gabe Enzo: Need 10" wheels and some kind of elevating suspension
[2023-10-21T13:56:51] Gabe Enzo: Elevating springs etc
[2023-10-21T13:57:00] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_10393@21-10-2023_13-57-00.jpg>

[2023-10-21T13:57:16] Pandalgns: I have monorim front and rear and janobike t10 motors with 10" tyre
[2023-10-21T13:57:32] Pandalgns: <video_file>
[2023-10-21T13:58:09] Gabe Enzo: where will this be mounted???
[2023-10-21T13:58:26] Pandalgns: On sides of extensor
[2023-10-21T13:58:42] Pandalgns: Here
[2023-10-21T13:58:47] Gabe Enzo: That's actually very smart. but you do know vesc isn't waterproof?
[2023-10-21T13:59:21] Gabe Enzo: I might take your idea lmfao. can you drop me the STL file pretty please ü•∫
[2023-10-21T13:59:33] Pandalgns: It would be necessary to seal the joints with a little silicone but the intention is to make it watertight
[2023-10-21T13:59:58] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_10397@21-10-2023_13-59-58.jpg>
[2023-10-21T14:00:02] Gabe Enzo: you printed the spacer wrong
[2023-10-21T14:00:16] Gabe Enzo: it's gonna put pressure on the internal threads and destroy them all at the same time
[2023-10-21T14:00:27] Gabe Enzo: Trust me it's gonna happen
[2023-10-21T14:00:40] Gabe Enzo: You need to take a few mm off your battery / spacer
[2023-10-21T14:01:47] Gabe Enzo: 3 rebuilds and those threads are dead.
[2023-10-21T14:02:01] Pandalgns: Green union of 3 pieces, Red holes of screws, its semi transparent
[2023-10-21T14:02:24] Pandalgns: that's why you see so many brands
[2023-10-21T14:02:36] Mirono escooters: Tinkercad ü•∞üòÇ
[2023-10-21T14:02:47] Pandalgns: Basic but i love it
[2023-10-21T14:02:49] Pandalgns: üòÇüòÇ
[2023-10-21T14:02:51] Mirono escooters: Nothing enough silicon cant fix
[2023-10-21T14:03:04] Mirono escooters: If you really want 100% You fill with epoxy like me
[2023-10-21T14:03:08] Mirono escooters: Tis a good startrr
[2023-10-21T14:03:39] Pandalgns: Epoxy its the other option
[2023-10-21T14:03:50] Pandalgns: the point is to seal the joints
[2023-10-21T14:04:02] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-10-21T14:04:03] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_10399@21-10-2023_14-04-03.jpg>
[2023-10-21T14:04:06] Mirono escooters: Dielectric epoxy
[2023-10-21T14:04:10] Gabe Enzo: is that bought? no way 3d print is that strong
[2023-10-21T14:04:21] Mirono escooters: You can 3DP it
[2023-10-21T14:04:22] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_10400@21-10-2023_14-04-22.jpg>
[2023-10-21T14:04:25] Mirono escooters: Petg and 100% infill
[2023-10-21T14:04:50] Gabe Enzo: Way too high lmao wtf
[2023-10-21T14:04:54] Gabe Enzo: looks like a tree
[2023-10-21T14:05:04] Pandalgns: Pla 70% and it's indestructible... I've been using it for a while and it's perfect
[2023-10-21T14:05:30] Gabe Enzo: do you have a STL file
[2023-10-21T14:05:40] Pandalgns: christmas tree
[2023-10-21T14:05:41] Pandalgns: üòÇüòÇ
[2023-10-21T14:06:21] Pandalgns: of the controller mounts or footrest??
[2023-10-21T14:06:52] Gabe Enzo: Both.
[2023-10-21T14:07:10] Gabe Enzo: do you have a shorter file of the foot rest?
[2023-10-21T14:07:29] Mirono escooters: My friend may share the STL. I don't know.
[2023-10-21T14:07:34] Mirono escooters: He's not in here
[2023-10-21T14:07:50] Mirono escooters: https://www.thingiverse.com/skegget86/designs
[2023-10-21T14:07:58] Mirono escooters: Maybe here Otherwise pm him
[2023-10-21T14:08:06] Pandalgns: I am finishing the design of the controller supports, I have it for the footrest, they are my own designs
[2023-10-21T14:09:39] Pandalgns: Note that the footrest is to be mounted solely and exclusively on Xiaomi Pro with monorim rear suspension, it is a very specific design that I made for my Xiaomi
[2023-10-21T14:09:51] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_10401@21-10-2023_14-09-51.jpg>
[2023-10-21T14:10:18] Pandalgns: If you prefer, we can talk privately.
[2023-10-21T14:13:29] Mirono escooters: Oh it clamps around spring. Nice
[2023-10-21T14:15:10] Pandalgns: <photos/photo_10402@21-10-2023_14-15-10.jpg>
[2023-10-21T14:15:13] Gabe Enzo: Of course! will it work with all rear monorim versions?
[2023-10-21T14:16:03] Pandalgns: I think so hehe I only tried it on mine but if they are the same measurements it should work
[2023-10-21T14:19:09] Mirono escooters: Doesn't the spring housing move slightly too?
[2023-10-21T14:19:35] Oreo huzky: Dosent the spring need to move a bit?
[2023-10-21T14:21:35] Pandalgns: here you have a small tolerance to counteract the movement
[2023-10-21T14:25:32] Mirono escooters: Problably enough
[2023-10-21T14:26:31] Pandalgns: It works perfect, I jump curbs with it and it doesn't break or force itself
[2023-10-21T16:09:25] Pandalgns: Finished

[2023-10-21T23:01:23] Happy Giraffe: Maybe those cheap ali power meters between battery and esc can handle 80A for few seconds
[2023-10-21T23:01:40] puneDir: Or add 5a fwk
[2023-10-21T23:01:47] puneDir: And measure with multimeter
[2023-10-21T23:01:55] puneDir: To see real amps
[2023-10-21T23:03:18] haku: Nice! That a thick piece of copper. Did you solder all parrallel cells?
[2023-10-21T23:03:34] rosheee: there was 6awg cable before
[2023-10-21T23:03:39] rosheee: my friend flexed it off
[2023-10-21T23:03:47] rosheee: then forged a copper tube ^^
[2023-10-21T23:03:53] rosheee: and then did dis masterpiece
[2023-10-21T23:03:56] rosheee: <sticker>
[2023-10-21T23:04:12] Gabe Enzo: why have a throttle delay at all wtf. literally causes crashes
[2023-10-21T23:05:01] Gabe Enzo: huh,the ubox reads amps? nice
[2023-10-21T23:05:38] rosheee: ???
[2023-10-21T23:05:51] NetworkDir: idk
[2023-10-21T23:05:54] NetworkDir: but ubox better
[2023-10-21T23:05:56] Gabe Enzo: Why would you want your scooter to stutter
[2023-10-21T23:06:18] Gabe Enzo: Literally the stock xiaomis come with that awful feature
[2023-10-21T23:06:43] rosheee: Stutter?
[2023-10-21T23:06:52] Gabe Enzo: throttle delay.
[2023-10-21T23:07:12] rosheee: When push then first 5% no throttle
[2023-10-21T23:07:35] Gabe Enzo: Of course, but that isn't like throttle delay in milliseconds as he said
[2023-10-21T23:07:48] Konstantin: My read true value...xD and vesc too.. just colibrate all and build right firmware;)
[2023-10-21T23:07:54] Gabe Enzo: he said 0.05s, not throttle sensitivity
[2023-10-21T23:09:39] Konstantin: My old ts100 can solder it too)
[2023-10-21T23:09:51] haku: Magnifico! What are the specs of this pack if you dont mind me asking?
[2023-10-21T23:10:01] rosheee: my friend did rework
[2023-10-21T23:10:06] rosheee: 6awg was there before
[2023-10-21T23:10:10] rosheee: flexed off
[2023-10-21T23:10:11] rosheee: 20s6p
[2023-10-21T23:10:30] Gabe Enzo: what on god's green earth is that thing
[2023-10-21T23:11:05] Gabe Enzo: wtf is that tool
[2023-10-21T23:11:15] haku: Those are some thick bussbars for 6p
[2023-10-21T23:11:19] rosheee: 300w solder iron
[2023-10-21T23:11:32] Gabe Enzo: That would literally just kill every cell in milliseconds
[2023-10-21T23:11:36] Gabe Enzo: ?????
[2023-10-21T23:11:55] Gabe Enzo: Y u soldering on cells
[2023-10-21T23:11:56] Gabe Enzo: Lol
[2023-10-21T23:11:57] Konstantin: Y, I'm too often use cooper tube ;)
[2023-10-21T23:13:21] haku: Thats a long time to have an iron on a cell. But if it works it works!
[2023-10-21T23:13:59] Mirono escooters: Most heat goes into the copper
[2023-10-21T23:14:03] Mirono escooters: Or that's the plan : D
[2023-10-21T23:15:10] haku: Ahh. Works like a heatsink
[2023-10-21T23:17:21] haku: Can you explain the copper tube. Im new to this.
[2023-10-21T23:17:56] Konstantin: + hummer xD
[2023-10-21T23:18:36] haku: Gotcha. Just cut and flex it to make bussbars?
[2023-10-21T23:18:45] Konstantin: Y
[2023-10-21T23:19:09] Gabe Enzo: Just hammer it
[2023-10-21T23:20:09] haku: Why not cut thick copper sheets? Sorry im new to this
[2023-10-21T23:20:52] francois schempers: slow ramp up of A that is not a huge difference on the user, but helps a lot with temperature, instant A will generate a lot more heat
[2023-10-21T23:24:04] haku: Do you sand the copper 1st for the solder to adhear?
[2023-10-21T23:31:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: Nah I see better
[2023-10-21T23:32:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_10418@21-10-2023_23-32-18.jpg>
[2023-10-21T23:33:00] rosheee: always
[2023-10-21T23:55:31] Happy Giraffe: You wont even notice 1/20th of a second tbh. Just makes start a bit more easy on tires.
[2023-10-22T00:13:28] Mirono escooters: I have some here, didn't do yet
[2023-10-22T00:13:33] Mirono escooters: The GitHub one seemed very nice
[2023-10-22T00:58:48] puneDir: <video_file>
[2023-10-22T00:58:49] puneDir: @jamessoderstrom
[2023-10-22T00:59:04] puneDir: 75100 powered lol
[2023-10-22T00:59:51] puneDir: Slow
[2023-10-22T00:59:53] puneDir: Open the sound
[2023-10-22T01:00:05] NetworkDir: It's ok
[2023-10-22T01:00:18] puneDir: They wanted the wheelspin
[2023-10-22T01:00:41] NetworkDir: normal
[2023-10-22T01:00:43] NetworkDir: phase low
[2023-10-22T01:00:46] NetworkDir: 180A phase
[2023-10-22T01:00:51] NetworkDir: for 80A battery current low
[2023-10-22T01:00:56] NetworkDir: 1/2 1/3 values :)
[2023-10-22T01:01:06] NetworkDir: with 200A phase it's better
[2023-10-22T01:01:18] puneDir: And he blew 4 mosfets because of shit motor cable melted and shorted
[2023-10-22T01:01:32] puneDir: They used house wire for motor
[2023-10-22T01:01:39] NetworkDir: using house wire for motor
[2023-10-22T01:01:41] NetworkDir: smart
[2023-10-22T01:01:56] NetworkDir: and he say why scooter turned off
[2023-10-22T01:01:59] NetworkDir: Hahahaha
[2023-10-22T01:02:05] NetworkDir: RIP 4 mosfets
[2023-10-22T01:02:12] NetworkDir: but good pcb fine just mosfet fucked up
[2023-10-22T01:02:25] NetworkDir: time to scam makerbase with dispute XD
[2023-10-22T01:02:43] puneDir: Atleast pcb is fine
[2023-10-22T01:02:55] puneDir: My 75100 was giving the exact current
[2023-10-22T01:02:58] puneDir: Thats weird
[2023-10-22T01:03:14] NetworkDir: Makerbase and flipsky different
[2023-10-22T01:03:33] puneDir: Shitsky seems to be better
[2023-10-22T01:03:39] NetworkDir: maybe
[2023-10-22T01:24:45] Happy Giraffe: Never amazes me how stupid some human beings can beüòÅ
[2023-10-22T01:27:51] Gabe Enzo: what you're talking about is just acceleration curves lol
[2023-10-22T01:28:17] Gabe Enzo: I don't mean ramping up of amps, I mean initial touch trigger status to be sent to the motor.
[2023-10-22T01:29:05] Gabe Enzo: like a delay
[2023-10-22T01:31:11] Happy Giraffe: That 0.05sec is just a habit of mine. Doesnt affect much in use. I try to avoid using maximum values if something is off to smoothen it out a little. Maybe I have a PTSD idk
[2023-10-22T01:31:38] Gabe Enzo: Bruh do U know how many tight situations you can escape with no delay
[2023-10-22T01:31:53] Gabe Enzo: Can avoid getting mashed by a truck because you squeeze out
[2023-10-22T01:32:04] Gabe Enzo: every m/s matters
[2023-10-22T01:37:51] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: How did a beginner even get the opportunity to control such powerful equipment?üòÖ
[2023-10-22T01:39:48] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I never drive with any delays
[2023-10-22T01:41:06] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: In my humble opinion, delays can only occur in women, but not in engine control
[2023-10-22T01:41:10] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Just kidding
[2023-10-22T01:41:46] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Thats pretty ok
[2023-10-22T01:41:57] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: But not 1 sec or slower
[2023-10-22T01:44:06] Gabe Enzo: As in what?
[2023-10-22T01:44:22] Gabe Enzo: Do you not get ready physically for when the scooter is about to jet?
[2023-10-22T01:46:45] Happy Giraffe: You should rethink your life choices if 0.05 seconds saves you from a situationüòÖ
[2023-10-22T01:46:55] NetworkDir: I like 0s XD
[2023-10-22T01:48:34] Happy Giraffe: 0 also ok for real go try 0.05 and you wouldnt noticeüòÇ
[2023-10-22T01:54:31] Happy Giraffe: But if you want to have maximum grip and save tires you would either use throttle easier on first half second or do it in settings. You gotta put some "load" on the tire to activate the maximum grip. Same principal with braking, if you push gently the brake lever first you feel the combined weight will move to front. After that you can press the brake very hard and still maintain more grip. If you instantly press max grip force on brakes tire will skid and you fallüòÅ
[2023-10-22T02:00:52] Gabe Enzo: Cars are retards bro
[2023-10-22T02:02:32] Happy Giraffe: More than 50% of the population is
[2023-10-22T04:47:29] haku: I was riding my scooter and my throttle is messing up. I did setup input and its buggy
[2023-10-22T04:48:28] haku: What could he causing this. I have a spintend spinny throttle.
[2023-10-22T05:02:30] rosheee: I didnt xD
[2023-10-22T05:03:00] rosheee: Haircut tells us
[2023-10-22T05:03:25] rosheee: Welcome 2 flipsky filter
[2023-10-22T05:15:21] haku: Is this normal on 6.02. The throttle bugs out
[2023-10-22T06:02:21] haku: I got it fixed but it seems like the motor only runs with no heavy load. When i ride it it stops and if i apply less weight it will run. Anyone know how to fix this issue. Vesc is spintend dual 100/100.
[2023-10-22T06:02:51] haku: Maybe im just too fat üò≠
[2023-10-22T06:07:32] haku: Please help me vesc lords
[2023-10-22T06:16:53] rosheee: Yo
[2023-10-22T07:33:56] puneDir: Its not me
[2023-10-22T07:34:20] puneDir: Which mosfet is recommended for 75100
[2023-10-22T07:44:55] rosheee: XD DID I SAY ANYTHING? i hope it isn't u üòÜcuz trashbag haircut and shitsky üòÜ

[2023-10-22T10:18:12] Ivan Deriu: Esatto! Chiedevo perch√© voglio modificare il mio g3 e ho un po‚Äô di dubbi sulla programmazione e sui parametri da impostare
[2023-10-22T10:19:27] puneDir: Why tf makerbase reads 1/3 current
[2023-10-22T10:25:28] rosheee: easteregg
[2023-10-22T10:26:14] Gabe Enzo: is phase 1/3 or 1/2? how can you have 80a batt and 200a phase

[2023-10-22T10:42:50] Mirko Boni: Cos'√® il V2? What is V2?
[2023-10-22T10:43:23] Ivan Deriu: Il controller per doppio motore
[2023-10-22T10:43:42] Ivan Deriu: Flipsky v2
[2023-10-22T10:44:17] Mirko Boni: No no, ho installato due controller spintend ubox 80V No, I installed two spintend ubox 80V controllers
[2023-10-22T10:48:06] Mirko Boni: I motori sono dei 60H avvolgimento standard mi pare raggiungano 3500w The motors are standard 60H windings I think they reach 3500w

[2023-10-22T12:10:29] Face de Pin Suc√©: Haha, custom made frame
[2023-10-22T12:15:41] Mirono escooters: Very cool ..
[2023-10-22T12:15:43] Mirono escooters: Who designed it?
[2023-10-22T12:21:18] rosheee: ZAGATO
[2023-10-22T12:23:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: Collaboration with BO Mobility

[2023-10-22T12:34:37] rosheee: red nami?
[2023-10-22T12:35:37] Face de Pin Suc√©: This is the BO M, the small one from what is based on the TurBO we made
[2023-10-22T12:35:45] Mirono escooters: Yes looks very good , well designed
[2023-10-22T12:39:06] Jan: C'est beau
[2023-10-22T12:39:27] Jan: C'est BO
[2023-10-22T12:40:08] Jan: Was there a french word game at the start of the video?
[2023-10-22T12:40:20] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes haha
[2023-10-22T12:44:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: Haha because it is not anymore üòé
[2023-10-22T12:44:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: Now it is RM-One
[2023-10-22T12:44:44] Face de Pin Suc√©: With custom base frame
[2023-10-22T12:48:48] Face de Pin Suc√©: Raphael is pushing the limits with his SR-One (red nami)
[2023-10-22T12:48:57] Face de Pin Suc√©: Today at Circuit d'Issoire
[2023-10-22T12:50:56] Face de Pin Suc√©: <photos/photo_10428@22-10-2023_12-50-56.jpg>
[2023-10-22T12:55:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: What I can tell is, Duty Cycle is at 90% at 158Kmh, meaning he could even go faster if he didn't have to brake x) We need to try on open road
[2023-10-22T12:55:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: And after, we need to try with Field Weakening
[2023-10-22T12:56:12] Mirono escooters: Wo, that must draw so much power
[2023-10-22T12:57:11] Face de Pin Suc√©: 29925W from what recorded SmartDisplay
[2023-10-22T12:57:24] Face de Pin Suc√©: so must be around 35000W displayed in RT Data from VESC
[2023-10-22T12:57:38] Face de Pin Suc√©: (because VESC always shows more power in RT Data)
[2023-10-22T13:07:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: Because they don't push from 0
[2023-10-22T13:07:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's not a race, only a trackday
[2023-10-22T13:22:03] haku: It seems like its a setting in the balancing department. It seems like its running like a onewheel or a unicycle
[2023-10-22T13:37:58] Yamal: I also think that the accelerations of the red nami are not "very strong" because of the winding that is 33/2 speed?
[2023-10-22T13:47:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, but it accelerates quite a lot actually on track
[2023-10-22T13:48:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: 33x2 75h is different than 33x2 65h, it has more torque
[2023-10-22T13:57:26] Yamal: I know Paolo is 75h ..üßê anyway Don't you think that 22/3 would give much more strength?
[2023-10-22T13:57:48] Yamal: They say it is the most balanced winding
[2023-10-22T14:01:46] haku: It seems like the scooter will run if placed in the air but when i ride on it it will not run. So to get home i have to press the throttle then hop on the scooter. If i press the throttle with me on it will not run
[2023-10-22T14:02:04] haku: No never did
[2023-10-22T14:02:19] Gabe Enzo: Phase
[2023-10-22T14:02:22] Gabe Enzo: Grinding
[2023-10-22T14:02:36] Gabe Enzo: ???
[2023-10-22T14:02:42] haku: What that?
[2023-10-22T14:02:43] Gabe Enzo: this happened to me lol
[2023-10-22T14:02:54] Gabe Enzo: That it runs in the air but not on ground
[2023-10-22T14:03:31] Gabe Enzo: Then I had a ride on it and it blew at 40kmh
[2023-10-22T14:03:32] haku: Also when setting up setup input for throttle. Sometimes there is a long beep from vesc.
[2023-10-22T14:04:14] haku: I see
[2023-10-22T14:04:33] haku: Ok
[2023-10-22T14:04:51] haku: Is that a motor issue?
[2023-10-22T14:05:44] haku: Great. Thanks james.

[2023-10-22T14:06:48] puneDir: You think its caused by shit cable or too many phase
[2023-10-22T14:06:52] puneDir: (60h)
[2023-10-22T14:06:58] NetworkDir: Too many phase not problem
[2023-10-22T14:07:01] NetworkDir: i use with 200A phase
[2023-10-22T14:07:06] NetworkDir: your cable melted
[2023-10-22T14:07:14] NetworkDir: and you simulated cut off for makerbase

[2023-10-22T15:55:44] Jan: G30 frame you can even achieve enough range or speed for everything ever
[2023-10-22T15:55:54] Gabe Enzo: Can fit 100 cells in the pro 2 frame and probably 110 if the vesc is further back
[2023-10-22T15:56:15] Gabe Enzo: Ans that's only with 20mm spacer
[2023-10-22T15:56:20] Gabe Enzo: Can probably sandwich in more
[2023-10-22T15:56:21] Gabe Enzo: ifk
[2023-10-22T15:56:24] Jan: With a neckback can fit 20s9p of M58T for 3.6kWh
[2023-10-22T15:57:09] Jan: Thats like 230km range
[2023-10-22T15:57:11] Gabe Enzo: Yeah my project at the moment is engineering a scooter that suits my needs. Speed, torque, range, comfyness, and the ability to carry a passenger.
[2023-10-22T15:57:23] Gabe Enzo: The g30 frame is essential to finish my project
[2023-10-22T15:57:39] Jan: SNSC can as it is a rental scooter frame
[2023-10-22T15:57:55] Gabe Enzo: I don't see my scooter as a toy but as like a vehicle to get to places
[2023-10-22T15:57:56] Mirono escooters: Passenger on escooter is dumb, sowwy
[2023-10-22T15:58:00] Jan: Samsung 50s
[2023-10-22T15:58:07] Mirono escooters: Isn't that it's purpose?..
[2023-10-22T15:58:18] Gabe Enzo: Kinda, most people are just the for fun kind
[2023-10-22T15:58:20] Gabe Enzo: Like sannio
[2023-10-22T15:58:23] Gabe Enzo: he only has 7ah
[2023-10-22T15:58:55] Gabe Enzo: Eh it CAN be handy but I don't do it And it's good that it's CAPABLE, life is relative.
[2023-10-22T15:59:40] Mirono escooters: Most? No, most use it for transportation xD
[2023-10-22T15:59:45] Mirono escooters: This group is exception
[2023-10-22T15:59:54] Gabe Enzo: I mean the community we are in lmfao
[2023-10-22T15:59:56] Mirono escooters: Goh. I wouldn't drive with 2 on any scoot
[2023-10-22T16:00:05] Mirono escooters: The community is big, this group is small
[2023-10-22T16:00:28] Gabe Enzo: I forgot to separate the modding community from the stock Community
[2023-10-22T16:00:36] puneDir: Yes
[2023-10-22T16:00:36] Gabe Enzo: the stock community is hilarious
[2023-10-22T16:00:47] Mirono escooters: Even modding community..
[2023-10-22T16:00:50] Gabe Enzo: they think they're the shit because they bought a surron or dualtron.
[2023-10-22T16:00:56] Gabe Enzo: HAHA
[2023-10-22T16:00:59] puneDir: Passanger just ruins the balance
[2023-10-22T16:01:07] Gabe Enzo: Yea.
[2023-10-22T16:01:42] Gabe Enzo: bro when the plug calls saying he's there and you and your buddy are 15m away he's getting on that fucking scooter asap
[2023-10-22T16:01:51] Gabe Enzo: üóø

[2023-10-22T16:43:46] Mirono escooters: Scam
[2023-10-22T16:43:53] Mirono escooters: Why not print a big one and not 1 per 1
[2023-10-22T16:44:06] puneDir: I just printed these to test
[2023-10-22T16:44:09] puneDir: Now printing big one
[2023-10-22T16:45:08] Mirono escooters: Oki

[2023-10-22T17:28:33] puneDir: hard to produce?
[2023-10-22T17:29:01] Happy Giraffe: Cylinder shape gives most surface area for the rolled sheet inside But here there might be some else manufacturing problem we can't know
[2023-10-22T17:29:17] Mirono escooters: It doesn't make sense
[2023-10-22T17:41:47] Gabe Enzo: it makes total sense bru
[2023-10-22T17:41:55] Gabe Enzo: for space
[2023-10-22T17:42:06] Gabe Enzo: save like 10% of air space
[2023-10-22T17:42:29] Mirono escooters: Factory wise..
[2023-10-22T17:42:34] Mirono escooters: Get pouch cells if ya want that
[2023-10-22T17:46:58] Gabe Enzo: oh shit you're right those are rectangular cells
[2023-10-22T17:47:03] Gabe Enzo: Guys, am I losing my mind?

[2023-10-22T17:49:41] Gabe Enzo: No better mathematicians around than engineers.
[2023-10-22T17:50:01] Gabe Enzo: Be thankful i didn't be like "solve this quadratic for me ape"
[2023-10-22T17:50:07] Mirono escooters: ü§¶

[2023-10-22T18:03:22] Gabe Enzo: Shhhh
[2023-10-22T18:03:37] Mirono escooters: Tis kinda obvious :)
[2023-10-22T18:37:37] Unknown: I‚Äôm happy to see my custom work making waves out there. Long hours and hard work. Definitely trying to slowly make my mark. Really thought the thing is a beast. It‚Äôs only moderately tuned and someone already got hurt riding it https://youtu.be/Nafri7HxAWc?si=tYQoJpqGHSUbCrqM
[2023-10-22T19:24:32] puneDir: what u guys think ncep15t14 on 75100
[2023-10-22T19:25:58] NetworkDir: Not good
[2023-10-22T19:26:12] NetworkDir: Resistance high because voltage high
[2023-10-22T19:27:20] NetworkDir: Smart answer
[2023-10-22T19:29:53] haku: Do you guys really push your molicels to the full 45a? How long till it starts heating up?
[2023-10-22T19:31:40] Jan: For short burst more than 45a
[2023-10-22T19:32:31] haku: Wow! More than 45a thats insane.
[2023-10-22T19:32:51] haku: I did not know it can handle more
[2023-10-22T19:33:45] haku: I am being too consrvative with my bms choice. 300a for a 9p
[2023-10-22T19:33:51] Happy Giraffe: Why not add one P more and stay at 40AüòÖ
[2023-10-22T19:33:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: 45A technically is already over rated
[2023-10-22T19:34:07] Happy Giraffe: Also recommended thermal sensor
[2023-10-22T19:34:13] Paolo ‚Å≠: But for not continuos use as escooter should be ok
[2023-10-22T19:34:40] Happy Giraffe: Vesc should have option for 10sec max boost current
[2023-10-22T19:34:46] Jan: The word continuous use should not exist in the scooter space
[2023-10-22T19:35:11] Jan: Nobody is gonna full send it from full to empty without releasing throttle once
[2023-10-22T19:35:30] haku: Thats true.
[2023-10-22T19:35:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you discharge continuously 40A molicel , it reaches 96C in less than 2 minutes
[2023-10-22T19:36:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Or I don‚Äôt remind, just see datasheet
[2023-10-22T19:36:16] haku: Good info there. Thanks
[2023-10-22T19:36:21] Jan: 50A for 20sec max, let it cool down again
[2023-10-22T19:36:33] Jan: Thats enough for a topspeed run
[2023-10-22T19:36:53] Jan: 0-100kmh 5-6s
[2023-10-22T19:37:30] haku: Nice!
[2023-10-22T19:37:40] Jan: For racetrack needs a bit more cells i guess
[2023-10-22T19:37:53] Jan: As you push full send after every corner
[2023-10-22T19:37:58] Jan: until depleted
[2023-10-22T19:38:22] puneDir: Anyone tried to make 12 fet 75100?
[2023-10-22T19:38:27] haku: Yea.
[2023-10-22T19:39:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Lol, not possible with 10 inch scooter
[2023-10-22T19:39:18] Mirono escooters: Drivers aren't rated for it Snubbers aren't calculated for it Do it properly
[2023-10-22T19:39:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: At least commercial tire
[2023-10-22T19:39:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: Grip not enough
[2023-10-22T19:39:48] Jan: PMT warm, low pressure, 70kg rider
[2023-10-22T19:40:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Still no possible
[2023-10-22T19:40:26] Jan: hm i think it is
[2023-10-22T19:40:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs difficult to do with slick 110 which is double of area of 10 inch pmt , warm and 75kg rider
[2023-10-22T19:40:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: Problem isn‚Äôt power, is more grip issue
[2023-10-22T19:41:02] Jan: I need to check some log files
[2023-10-22T19:41:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: Maybe in track with glue maybe possible
[2023-10-22T19:41:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: Vesc log don‚Äôt count, only dragy for some realistic data
[2023-10-22T19:42:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: If tire slips how the speed could be accurate, if it measures speed from the wheel rotation
[2023-10-22T19:43:38] Jan: GPS module not enough ?
[2023-10-22T19:43:47] haku: Doesnt vesc log+gps should be precise
[2023-10-22T19:44:31] Paolo ‚Å≠: Dragy use sensors and high frequency gps
[2023-10-22T19:44:39] haku: That should be enough to track top speed.
[2023-10-22T19:44:49] Mirono escooters: Even phone is fine for topspeed
[2023-10-22T19:44:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Rear wheel slips anywayüòÇ ask to @Simone_19 hahaha
[2023-10-22T19:44:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes, but not for acceleration
[2023-10-22T19:45:05] Mirono escooters: I didn't say that.
[2023-10-22T19:45:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: We talking about acceleration
[2023-10-22T19:45:39] Mirono escooters: He was talking about speed, and I confirmed something to him
[2023-10-22T19:45:51] Mirono escooters: 200‚Ç¨ tho, awtsh
[2023-10-22T19:45:59] haku: Yea. Top speed
[2023-10-22T19:46:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: Buy on Amazon, do test then. Return Xd
[2023-10-22T19:46:15] Mirono escooters: Comprehensive Reading isn't best ü§≠
[2023-10-22T19:46:19] Mirono escooters: Lol, I'm not like that
[2023-10-22T19:46:30] Mirono escooters: Maybe for bomber I buy Nothing else is useful for me
[2023-10-22T19:47:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: If you don‚Äôt damage the package and the product , you can do it as law say, it‚Äôs 100% legal
[2023-10-22T19:48:33] Mirono escooters: I dont like such behaviour
[2023-10-22T19:48:45] Mirono escooters: And if i want such a tool, I'll keep it, its a nice thing But im not rich
[2023-10-22T19:50:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: So just use , and resell if you think it‚Äôs right
[2023-10-22T19:50:15] Mirono escooters: Mjeh
[2023-10-22T19:50:24] Mirono escooters: I'll see later. Bomber is, far from rddy
[2023-10-22T19:50:40] haku: Yea. Amazon return policy is the best.
[2023-10-22T19:51:21] haku: Too bad sometimes it gets taken advantage of. Lime returning false items
[2023-10-22T19:51:57] puneDir: aliexpress better
[2023-10-22T19:52:07] puneDir: They send new one and you keep the broken one
[2023-10-22T19:52:20] puneDir: you repair the dead one and keep it for spare
[2023-10-22T19:52:24] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2023-10-22T19:56:47] haku: I did not know that! Wow everytime i buy bad things in aliexpress i take it as a loss.
[2023-10-22T19:58:53] Happy Giraffe: You going to still build it?

[2023-10-22T21:28:20] haku: Is makerx a reputable company?
[2023-10-22T21:28:38] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-10-22T21:28:58] haku: Nice!
[2023-10-22T21:29:50] haku: Is it possible to have 2 of them over can?
[2023-10-22T21:30:01] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-10-22T21:30:07] haku: Nice!
[2023-10-22T21:30:50] haku: I like the g300 design. Will spintend adapter work with it?
[2023-10-22T21:30:58] Mirono escooters: Good question
[2023-10-22T21:31:01] haku: Adc adapter
[2023-10-22T21:31:09] Mirono escooters: Should be universal. But im no SPintend e xpert
[2023-10-22T21:31:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: Very strong
[2023-10-22T21:32:45] Santiago: Hi guys, surely there is somebody with more experience on cells so I wanted to know if Samsung INR21700-50S cells are good?? Maybe for a 16s or 20s build depends on what I can fit in the pro 2 frame xD
[2023-10-22T21:33:10] Mirono escooters: Most find them overrated
[2023-10-22T21:33:14] Mirono escooters: Wich amps do u need?
[2023-10-22T21:33:42] Santiago: I just need something that does 20-35A safely
[2023-10-22T21:34:21] Santiago: For everyday fun rides
[2023-10-22T21:34:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: Up to 25-30A is good
[2023-10-22T21:34:30] Mirono escooters: 40T or p42a
[2023-10-22T21:34:41] Mirono escooters: U mean per cell?
[2023-10-22T21:34:45] Santiago: Yeah
[2023-10-22T21:35:08] JPPL: Yes
[2023-10-22T21:35:26] Santiago: I'll check them out, either way I'd try to cheap out a bit cuz I'm unemployed ü•π
[2023-10-22T21:35:34] haku: Thats good to know. Thanks
[2023-10-22T21:35:44] Mirono escooters: 40T is a very nice price quality cell
[2023-10-22T21:35:57] Mirono escooters: Nkon has tenpower 40tg, for very cheap ü§∑üòÖ
[2023-10-22T21:36:23] JPPL: I love 40T
[2023-10-22T21:37:02] haku: Once 18650 battery had a sale on them 2.99 a piece. But im really set on p42. Waiting on a sale
[2023-10-22T21:37:48] haku: I think the sale went on for a whole month
[2023-10-22T21:38:25] Mirono escooters: Not much diff between 40t and p42a
[2023-10-22T21:38:37] Mirono escooters: For capacity defenitely not, p42a says min capacity 4000mah xd
[2023-10-22T21:59:56] Mirono escooters: I trust tenpower
[2023-10-22T22:01:45] Mirono escooters: I had some cells sometime ago, tested all within specs
[2023-10-22T22:01:50] Mirono escooters: And saw a batt or 2 with em
[2023-10-22T22:02:08] Mirono escooters: And nkon never buys shit brand cells Always some sort of acknowledge they good
[2023-10-22T22:03:03] Mirono escooters: I think it was a vape cell I tested. Pretty sure One of the protected ones
[2023-10-22T22:56:43] haku: How do i make the other esc (ubox_v2_100 40) into my main vesc? I want it to be the local one instead of the other

[2023-10-22T23:01:20] haku: Thank you. Vesc very complicated for a noob but im slowly learning it
[2023-10-22T23:25:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Is there longer version?
[2023-10-22T23:28:00] Happy Giraffe: Molicel P45B better
[2023-10-22T23:28:51] Happy Giraffe: P42A cheaper and some 30T are way cheaper but limited in capacity

[2023-10-23T00:20:35] francois schempers: I like in the video you see a bunch of dude following each other at 70 thinking they are racing and their is Raphael passing them at 90 like they are stopped üòÇüòÇ
[2023-10-23T00:41:04] haku: Do you guys solder your connections to the adc adapter or screw it down?
[2023-10-23T00:42:03] haku: I want a 3d printer so bad! This is awsome
[2023-10-23T00:42:54] haku: What filament do you use for scooter stuff?
[2023-10-23T00:43:04] Pandalgns: Thx mate
[2023-10-23T00:44:04] Pandalgns: I normally print with pla+ from the gst3d brand but I will start printing with petg and try filaments like abs or some type of resistant filament
[2023-10-23T00:45:04] haku: 3d printer makes your scoot one of a kind. If i had one i would print a body kit and a spoiler to my laotie
[2023-10-23T00:47:09] Pandalgns: I have several things made in 3D for my scooter and I have quite a few designs made specifically for Xiaomi Pro but I recently finished a design for a spoiler about 15 20cm high and 60cm wide for a friend's tricked-out speedway pro.
[2023-10-23T00:48:12] Pandalgns: Va progresando, en breves terminado el dise√±o y empezamos a imprimirlo üòé
[2023-10-23T00:48:42] Pandalgns: that video was a while ago now the design is finished
[2023-10-23T00:50:26] haku: Also cad will take talent and time to learn
[2023-10-23T00:51:52] haku: Soldering can get messy if you take wires on and off. I might just screw mine
[2023-10-23T01:29:03] Happy Giraffe: Solder a quick connectorüëç
[2023-10-23T01:40:10] haku: What is a quick connector? The crimped ones?
[2023-10-23T01:43:30] Santiago: Eso va en el reposa pies?
[2023-10-23T01:43:58] Santiago: The ones you plug in and out easily I guess
[2023-10-23T01:44:02] francois schempers: bullet connector
[2023-10-23T01:46:13] haku: Oh sorry i was talking about adc adapter
[2023-10-23T01:46:13] haku: <photos/photo_10447@23-10-2023_01-46-13.jpg>

[2023-10-23T01:46:34] haku: I soldered instead of plugging
[2023-10-23T01:46:57] haku: Yea this is what i use for phase
[2023-10-23T01:47:53] Gabe Enzo: Lol you should make a Xiaomi spoiler
[2023-10-23T01:48:35] haku: I really want to do this just for fun lol

[2023-10-23T01:51:29] Gabe Enzo: I can't learn cad to make shit myself

[2023-10-23T01:52:26] haku: I know right. I can edit photos and videos but cad is more engineering

[2023-10-23T02:00:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt make useless things
[2023-10-23T02:00:49] haku: üòÇ
[2023-10-23T02:01:07] haku: You need downforce G
[2023-10-23T02:01:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt finish my escooter because of time, how I can do this Xd
[2023-10-23T02:40:42] haku: My spiny thottle is broken. It will not manually calibrate.
[2023-10-23T02:41:32] haku: Good thinking i bought a spare. I just dont want to go thru the hassle of rewiring and soldering again
[2023-10-23T03:23:29] Happy Giraffe: For iex lights you could use xt30 or similar bolted or soldered to adc
[2023-10-23T03:24:08] Happy Giraffe: Fusion360
[2023-10-23T03:24:51] Happy Giraffe: I tried to draw on Mastercam (2024 version) and it looked like 2006 Runescape menu icon graphics
[2023-10-23T05:52:04] haku: Do you guys know how much is this motor really rated? Vsett9+ motor. According to the website its 600w. Im sure it can do more.
[2023-10-23T06:23:52] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Any motor can do more than its rating. What matters is for how long it can take a certain power and that's what no one here will be able to tell you exactly.
[2023-10-23T06:24:09] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: My guess is that it easily takes ~5 kW for some time.
[2023-10-23T06:24:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But that depends also on how you drive, if it's dual or single etc... So eh, best thing you can do is attach temp sensor and check the cables.
[2023-10-23T06:35:48] haku: Gotcha thanks. I was wondering if this scooter is vesc worthy
[2023-10-23T07:08:16] Pandalgns: Va atornillado donde ir√≠a el reposapies met√°lico del smartgyro speedway pro
[2023-10-23T14:51:15] Mirko Boni: @Mirono_escooters, @kawaiinekololis good morning, I have a curiosity, for the original ninebot electronics, besides Happy BMS, is there any other way to install a 13/14/15S battery?
[2023-10-23T14:51:53] Mirono escooters: Good morning Mirko Yes, use Bluetooth BMS
[2023-10-23T14:52:07] Mirono escooters: And you can mod the Ninebot controller, to use BMS emulation.
[2023-10-23T14:52:46] Mirko Boni: Is there any guidance for studying this topic?
[2023-10-23T14:54:13] Mirko Boni: The battery is to be made by my friend @jamessoderstrom, a 15S 4P
[2023-10-23T14:54:19] Mirono escooters: It's scattered everywhere
[2023-10-23T14:54:41] Mirko Boni: I googled but found nothing.
[2023-10-23T14:54:42] Mirono escooters: You have to upgrade the capacitors, and replace 1 resistor Then use xiaodash to BMS emulate
[2023-10-23T14:55:04] Mirono escooters: Wich Esc version you have? 1 or 3 cap version
[2023-10-23T14:55:22] Mirko Boni: ohh ok ok now I get it
[2023-10-23T14:56:01] Mirko Boni: I have the control unit with 3 capacitors, and it is already modified with nichicon capacitors
[2023-10-23T14:56:23] Mirko Boni: 100V capacitors
[2023-10-23T14:56:48] Mirono escooters: Wait. I will find it for you
[2023-10-23T14:57:07] Mirko Boni: thank you for your help

[2023-10-23T15:00:22] Mirono escooters: 130k original 10s->12s (13s not really safe but works) 160k 13s 200k 15s 240k 16-17s 270k 20s
[2023-10-23T15:01:34] Mirko Boni: thank you @Mirono_escooters

[2023-10-23T16:12:54] Mirko Boni: I need 30A
[2023-10-23T16:18:38] Happy Giraffe: They won't ever change the design do they? Also the rear shock looks like it takes all the sand and dust insideüòÖ
[2023-10-23T16:19:09] Mirono escooters: Why change what's not broken
[2023-10-23T16:19:41] Happy Giraffe: But it isüòÖ

[2023-10-23T16:52:51] Mirono escooters: Ak made a script for Vsett dash

[2023-10-23T16:55:09] Mirono escooters: Too much BS?
[2023-10-23T16:55:25] puneDir: probably because of me

[2023-10-23T17:19:39] Mirono escooters: It's just plain translated from dutch Problably not the best
[2023-10-23T17:19:56] Happy Giraffe: Time to add a throttle with key to bike...cops cant say shit if key turned off and didnt see me activate it...
[2023-10-23T17:20:11] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2023-10-23T17:20:21] Mirono escooters: Me with no chain on bomber Super improvement
[2023-10-23T17:20:25] Mirono escooters: It's a walking bike officer
[2023-10-23T17:20:55] Happy Giraffe: Sir, this is bluetooth bike. It would be fun if it would measure resistance like a torque sensor
[2023-10-23T17:21:05] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-10-23T17:21:18] Happy Giraffe: Then you just apply pressure to pedal, pedal assist?üòÇ
[2023-10-23T17:22:36] Happy Giraffe: Im thinking of printing throttle key mount to handlebar from petg and then cover to that from tpu
[2023-10-23T17:23:07] Mirono escooters: Usually cops don't have a good sense of humour
[2023-10-23T17:25:36] Happy Giraffe: Some of them have here
[2023-10-23T17:25:50] Mirono escooters: Lucky you
[2023-10-23T17:26:12] Happy Giraffe: But I won't risk it, that's why the key to throttle signal wire
[2023-10-23T17:26:59] Happy Giraffe: I don't think wiring key to 5v is a good idea if it creates some sort of a spike idk
[2023-10-23T17:27:16] Mirono escooters: Is fine
[2023-10-23T17:49:16] Happy Giraffe: Me riding 35kmh might have a reason for it. With regular mtb I ride same speeds but added sweatüòÇ
[2023-10-23T17:54:47] Gabe Enzo: Is that how it works with ubox too yea
[2023-10-23T17:55:27] Gabe Enzo: It's dumb as hell, can go faster on a bike.
[2023-10-23T18:54:04] Happy Giraffe: I meant adding key lock to disable throttle
[2023-10-23T18:54:53] Happy Giraffe: Then I can choose to activate throttle if theres half a meter of snow or ice and hard to pedal
[2023-10-23T20:22:46] Gabe Enzo: HOW does spintend know I have a customs charge?
[2023-10-23T20:23:05] Gabe Enzo: it's not as if my local post office and them have contact?
[2023-10-23T20:24:02] Mirono escooters: Sure it us

[2023-10-23T21:23:36] KierreKikkeli: all tho having to pay 24% tax for buying a motor second hand from norway is way beyond stupid
[2023-10-23T21:23:50] KierreKikkeli: depends
[2023-10-23T21:23:54] Gabe Enzo: They are wannabe nationalists because they got fucked over by the British so it's all muh import tarrifs and encourage local production (literally Nazism lol)
[2023-10-23T21:23:56] KierreKikkeli: ah
[2023-10-23T21:23:57] KierreKikkeli: xd
[2023-10-23T21:24:48] KierreKikkeli: yeah, can be still taxed
[2023-10-23T21:25:05] Gabe Enzo: Yes sometimes they want you to buy nationally
[2023-10-23T21:25:08] Gabe Enzo: from your nation
[2023-10-23T21:25:20] KierreKikkeli: bought my vsett for 175‚Ç¨ or so used, had to pay 80‚Ç¨ for taxes and customs xd
[2023-10-23T21:25:33] Gabe Enzo: everything has tax included.
[2023-10-23T21:25:52] KierreKikkeli: yea
[2023-10-23T21:26:32] KierreKikkeli: customs were like 15‚Ç¨ or so the tax was the stupid point
[2023-10-23T21:26:42] Gabe Enzo: wtf why didn't I pay customs charge when @PaoloWu sent me 80‚Ç¨ worth of shit? Paolo did you tag the cost of the parcel as like 1‚Ç¨?
[2023-10-23T21:27:18] Gabe Enzo: Ah, he told me he's in China xd
[2023-10-23T21:27:26] Gabe Enzo: o he got friends there or somth
[2023-10-23T21:27:34] KierreKikkeli: we tried to send it as a gift xd, they opened it and didnt buy my 20‚Ç¨ declared value xd
[2023-10-23T21:28:36] KierreKikkeli: gifts here go for 0% tax, the customs gave 0 fucks about it and slapped the 24% tax
[2023-10-23T21:29:28] KierreKikkeli: it was declared as 0‚Ç¨ cost but they want to know the value of it, which they base the tax off of
[2023-10-23T21:29:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: There is amount what is ok
[2023-10-23T21:29:53] KierreKikkeli: you could sell me a car for 1‚Ç¨ but if it's value is 20K you pay the tax of 20K
[2023-10-23T21:29:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Like 40 euro here
[2023-10-23T21:30:08] KierreKikkeli: 0‚Ç¨ here

[2023-10-23T21:31:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Above always customs
[2023-10-23T21:31:54] KierreKikkeli: in here it used to be stuff under 25‚Ç¨ was non taxable, then they changed it some time ago to everything is taxed
[2023-10-23T21:32:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Swedish post is chaosüòÖ
[2023-10-23T21:32:59] KierreKikkeli: i swear joining the eu was the worst decicion for our country xd

[2023-10-23T21:40:00] KierreKikkeli: for torque and speed
[2023-10-23T21:40:32] KierreKikkeli: yeah my battery is 20A 12s XD

[2023-10-23T21:43:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: They managed 3 day pack, in 7 . while in any case tracking was fucked up
[2023-10-23T21:43:39] Gabe Enzo: but you can calculate phase with batt ye? If you have 40a batt you should have 120a phase... Phase is 1/3 as there are 3 wires
[2023-10-23T21:44:58] KierreKikkeli: https://www.reddit.com/r/Finland/comments/vr5of2/posti_rant/

[2023-10-23T21:46:08] KierreKikkeli: imagine failing a home delivery 11 times in a row claiming the recipient isnt home when hes on a permanent sick leave and fining him for rescheduling it :))
[2023-10-23T21:46:24] Gabe Enzo: Can you set battery Amps in ubox?
[2023-10-23T21:46:44] Gabe Enzo: OK that's thank fuck because for ninebot ESC you CANT
[2023-10-23T21:46:51] Gabe Enzo: It just relies on the smart bms
[2023-10-23T21:46:54] Gabe Enzo: dumb asf
[2023-10-23T21:47:05] Gabe Enzo: I was under the impression I was done for

[2023-10-23T21:48:52] Gabe Enzo: no heat
[2023-10-23T21:49:43] KierreKikkeli: on similiar context, gotta love getting your monthly bills weeks after the due date and or in some cases 6months after..... When the biller sent the letter 4km from you
[2023-10-23T21:50:07] KierreKikkeli: *enter payment late fee spiral*
[2023-10-23T21:51:38] KierreKikkeli: prob coz the hot potato game they play with all the parcels and letters; goes back and forth between central finland and southern finland from 2-10 times until it resumes normal route
[2023-10-23T21:56:38] haku: Unbelievable.
[2023-10-23T21:57:00] Happy Giraffe: What they lied about?
[2023-10-23T21:57:18] Gabe Enzo: declared value.
[2023-10-23T21:57:20] Gabe Enzo: for customs.
[2023-10-23T22:02:03] Happy Giraffe: Ofc they do

[2023-10-23T22:04:04] haku: Do you know if dual 100/100 ubox can run 22s? I talked to spintend they are suggesting 21s.
[2023-10-23T22:06:02] haku: I see. If you run 21s how much amps can you run on it?
[2023-10-23T22:06:30] haku: Gotcha!
[2023-10-23T22:07:05] haku: Ive been hearing 100/100 is a bad esc. Not the best from spintend
[2023-10-23T22:07:14] haku: The dual
[2023-10-23T22:08:08] haku: But i guess that is the best they have for dual esc.
[2023-10-23T22:10:08] haku: Yea man. I noticed its so buggy at 6.02
[2023-10-23T22:12:37] haku: Is there anything i can do to improve it? Change stuff? I already put thermal paste on frame and im still hitting 60c on a normal ride. My battery is only 60v
[2023-10-23T22:14:30] haku: 45 per side :(
[2023-10-23T22:14:37] haku: Attery amps
[2023-10-23T22:14:45] haku: 100
[2023-10-23T22:14:50] haku: 130 max
[2023-10-23T22:15:26] haku: Laotie lol

[2023-10-23T22:17:30] haku: I also get messages that update to latest firmware when seting motors
[2023-10-23T22:18:55] haku: Yes. They both have the same firmware.
[2023-10-23T22:20:15] haku: The bluetooth is right next to my phone. On a open deck.
[2023-10-23T22:21:14] haku: Android. Samsung s21
[2023-10-23T22:21:46] haku: Ill figure it out. Maybe user error.

[2023-10-23T22:22:40] haku: I can. But sometimes it bugs out
[2023-10-23T22:23:08] haku: Yes
[2023-10-23T22:23:46] haku: Also i noticed that on my desktop vesctool never opens. It just hangs with a white screen
[2023-10-23T22:28:08] haku: This is what it looks like on my desktop
[2023-10-23T22:29:12] haku: I tried to uninstall and reinstall.
[2023-10-23T22:46:15] Gabe Enzo: vesc tool is also for android ye?
[2023-10-23T22:46:17] Happy Giraffe: Fucking mess, ebrake+throttle wired to one multi core cable and then a key switch between throttle signalüåö
[2023-10-23T22:46:40] Gabe Enzo: @Happy_Giraffe do I need a pc to get my ubox started?

[2023-10-23T22:46:50] haku: Yes. I think its available on all platforms
[2023-10-23T22:47:02] Mirono escooters: Phone
[2023-10-23T22:47:03] Happy Giraffe: Nope if uart bluetooth is set to permanently on
[2023-10-23T22:47:56] Gabe Enzo: I made sure to get the Bluetooth version.
[2023-10-23T22:48:02] haku: I dont think so. I can setup motors on phone. I just wanted to use the pc and study the graphs and other stuff that vesctool windows has
[2023-10-23T22:48:02] Happy Giraffe: If some motherfucker takes this off then you need usb to turn it on again
[2023-10-23T22:48:02] Gabe Enzo: anyway what's UART?
[2023-10-23T22:48:07] Gabe Enzo: lmao
[2023-10-23T22:48:18] Gabe Enzo: ah Bluetooth module
[2023-10-23T22:48:19] Mirono escooters: The way Bluetooth talks with vesc
[2023-10-23T22:48:24] Gabe Enzo: makes sense why you cant turn it on after
[2023-10-23T22:48:32] puneDir: Cuz it closes
[2023-10-23T22:48:33] Happy Giraffe: And never put on "pairing done"
[2023-10-23T22:48:35] Mirono escooters: Hah, did that by accident
[2023-10-23T22:48:59] Gabe Enzo: what's that
[2023-10-23T22:49:13] Happy Giraffe: When connected by BT I decided "hey lets make pairing done so only my phone can connect"üòÇüòÇüòÇüåöüôàüôàüôà
[2023-10-23T22:49:34] Happy Giraffe: Then had to ride home and dissassemble bike to access usb...
[2023-10-23T22:50:02] haku: Does this need to be on or off?
[2023-10-23T22:50:02] Happy Giraffe: Some stupid setting to permanently lock bt to your phone. It needs some manual address typing it didnt tell beforehand
[2023-10-23T22:50:15] Happy Giraffe: Like in picture
[2023-10-23T22:50:17] Gabe Enzo: That's a good idea tbh
[2023-10-23T22:50:34] Gabe Enzo: because I've heard of people stealing xiaomis that are locked by just using shfw
[2023-10-23T22:50:41] Gabe Enzo: Unlock and run
[2023-10-23T22:50:52] Happy Giraffe: I have a key "turn on" so nobody cant fuck my settings anyway
[2023-10-23T22:50:58] Gabe Enzo: trueeee
[2023-10-23T22:51:02] Gabe Enzo: I have one too
[2023-10-23T22:51:09] Happy Giraffe: Xiaomis can be just carried away, it weighs like 15kg anyway
[2023-10-23T22:51:41] Mirono escooters: People who lock scooters only with electronic lock, are asking for it to be Stolen.
[2023-10-23T22:51:51] Mirono escooters: Stupid idea
[2023-10-23T22:57:08] Tommy: they steal 2/300 kg bikes in this way, loading them on vans...15kg is a job for boysüòÅüòÇ
[2023-10-23T22:57:21] Mirono escooters: Sadly
[2023-10-23T22:57:30] Mirono escooters: Proper locks r needed
[2023-10-23T23:02:11] Happy Giraffe: YeahüòÅ
[2023-10-23T23:02:28] Happy Giraffe: Minimum 10mm hardened chain if you want to keep you stuff
[2023-10-23T23:02:45] Happy Giraffe: Maybe 6-8mm for fast stop
[2023-10-23T23:04:07] Happy Giraffe: Scooter frames should have a mount for lock, doable with security bolts from outside. Bike easier to lock
[2023-10-23T23:04:32] Mirono escooters: Just a eye ring for a lock
[2023-10-23T23:04:34] Gabe Enzo: Just gotta make sure the mount is thicker than the actual lock
[2023-10-23T23:04:35] Mirono escooters: All u need
[2023-10-23T23:04:37] Gabe Enzo: LOl
[2023-10-23T23:04:44] Gabe Enzo: or they'll just cut the mount kek
[2023-10-23T23:15:50] Happy Giraffe: Yup, and since its propably not gonna be hardened. Atleast 3cm thicküòÇ That would add a ton of weight
[2023-10-23T23:16:28] Gabe Enzo: if someone was tech enough he could unscrew the entire stem
[2023-10-23T23:16:34] Gabe Enzo: so I'd rather have extra weight
[2023-10-23T23:16:36] Happy Giraffe: It's scary how powerful battery powered bolt cutters are atm
[2023-10-23T23:16:52] Gabe Enzo: Or battery angle grinders.
[2023-10-23T23:16:59] Happy Giraffe: Would need to be bolted to frame
[2023-10-23T23:17:06] Gabe Enzo: I've never heard of battery bolt cutters
[2023-10-23T23:17:16] Gabe Enzo: welded.
[2023-10-23T23:17:21] Gabe Enzo: the eye ring
[2023-10-23T23:17:30] Happy Giraffe: Yup, but those make more noise and are hard to operate in tight places.
[2023-10-23T23:17:38] Happy Giraffe: Also possible
[2023-10-23T23:17:56] Gabe Enzo: I meant that
[2023-10-23T23:18:08] Gabe Enzo: I thought you said to bolt on the eye ring
[2023-10-23T23:18:11] Gabe Enzo: that's dumb asg
[2023-10-23T23:18:13] Happy Giraffe: But welding alu eyelet is bit...wellüòÖ
[2023-10-23T23:18:50] Happy Giraffe: On steel frame would work. Alu way too weak, good for short stops tho
[2023-10-23T23:19:19] Gabe Enzo: I shiver my timbers when going to McDonald's bro
[2023-10-23T23:19:27] Gabe Enzo: I can't even eat my happy meal in peace
[2023-10-23T23:19:30] haku: Vesc should have a gps tracking feature. Thats the only way to stop thieves
[2023-10-23T23:20:16] haku: Vesc lords should make this.
[2023-10-23T23:21:28] Mirono escooters: *gives full throttle while stolen scooter is cornering *
[2023-10-23T23:21:39] haku: üòÇ
[2023-10-23T23:23:13] haku: If this feature is implimented surely vesc will get alot more attention from pev users
[2023-10-23T23:24:50] Happy Giraffe: I got airtag but its stupid it nowadays gives notification that they are followed
[2023-10-23T23:25:26] haku: About gps tracking. What is the best option out there?
[2023-10-23T23:25:37] haku: Tile?
[2023-10-23T23:25:42] Mirono escooters: Smart tag ftw
[2023-10-23T23:25:49] Mirono escooters: No, a real gps tracker
[2023-10-23T23:26:20] haku: Too bad those come with subscriptions
[2023-10-23T23:26:33] Mirono escooters: ü§∑ sim cards r cheap
[2023-10-23T23:26:40] Mirono escooters: I use smart tags in everything
[2023-10-23T23:26:48] Mirono escooters: We recovered Dad's ebike with it
[2023-10-23T23:26:51] Mirono escooters: Some luck is needed
[2023-10-23T23:27:01] haku: Nice!
[2023-10-23T23:28:28] haku: This one right? I think i have the old old version.
[2023-10-23T23:28:45] puneDir: i also have it
[2023-10-23T23:28:46] puneDir: its nice
[2023-10-23T23:28:54] Mirono escooters: Yes, there's a new version coming soon enough
[2023-10-23T23:29:02] Mirono escooters: And googles one. So it works on all androids Not just Samsung
[2023-10-23T23:29:20] puneDir: but simcard tracker is much more better than this
[2023-10-23T23:30:03] haku: I actually stop using these.
[2023-10-23T23:44:26] Happy Giraffe: If tracker used some battery with 30day life and vesc when powered could keep it charged
[2023-10-23T23:45:38] Mirono escooters: Jedich Nixan does that, kinda
[2023-10-23T23:46:01] Mirono escooters: When batt is on, gps batt is charged When Turned off got a few days batt life
[2023-10-23T23:55:46] Happy Giraffe: Next step, small and affordable
[2023-10-23T23:55:49] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-10-23T23:56:55] haku: Someone should make and program this. Innovation comes from forums like this.
[2023-10-23T23:58:07] Happy Giraffe: Denis could definitely make one but he aint interestedüò°
[2023-10-23T23:58:45] haku: He probably rake up some $$ selling it

[2023-10-24T02:25:10] Martin Kaktits: what do you guys and gals think about this ubox + 21s? üò¨ I would like regen üëâüëà
[2023-10-24T02:29:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: Your tronic died?
[2023-10-24T02:30:08] Martin Kaktits: ages ago
[2023-10-24T02:45:01] Martin Kaktits: also this new project anyway. Im done with xiaomi :D
[2023-10-24T02:47:19] Happy Giraffe: Why do you need the extra +1SüòÇ
[2023-10-24T02:47:37] Martin Kaktits: good question
[2023-10-24T02:47:40] Martin Kaktits: flex
[2023-10-24T02:47:42] Martin Kaktits: üòÜ
[2023-10-24T02:48:12] Martin Kaktits: 21s just the optimal space fill in new frame
[2023-10-24T02:48:12] Happy Giraffe: Mount for throttle key, 4 M3 countersunk bolts to mount to handlebarüòÅ
[2023-10-24T02:48:34] Happy Giraffe: Get bms or padding from the 1s space
[2023-10-24T02:49:05] Martin Kaktits: wtf is m2.5
[2023-10-24T02:49:12] Happy Giraffe: Cause Im not a chinese ladyboy called ***
[2023-10-24T02:49:15] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-10-24T02:50:06] Happy Giraffe: Its alright if tightened carefully I guess
[2023-10-24T02:50:25] Happy Giraffe: But to find bolts for that locally is ass
[2023-10-24T02:51:19] Happy Giraffe: Tomorrow I will test my dual throttle when parallel with torque sensorüòÇ
[2023-10-24T02:52:00] Happy Giraffe: I bet vesc be like wtf when receiving one stable 1.5v input and one giving 2.1 from adc module at the same timeüòÇ
[2023-10-24T02:52:32] Happy Giraffe: Btw can I somehow make adc module v1 output 3.3v? Is there a potentiometer screw? Now the motherfucker gives 2.1v
[2023-10-24T03:01:25] Happy Giraffe: Then I could add ton of power and torque sensor only sipping some of it. Throttle giving all laterüòÅ
[2023-10-24T03:01:38] Happy Giraffe: 2.1 from adc. Factory setup
[2023-10-24T03:07:01] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_10466@24-10-2023_03-07-01.jpg>
[2023-10-24T03:08:11] Happy Giraffe: There is but which direction and how much should I turn? If I get 0.5v by one turn it would be nice but dont have energy to care more
[2023-10-24T03:08:32] Happy Giraffe: That 5v and 3v selector is just for throttle type?
[2023-10-24T03:08:53] Happy Giraffe: Mine is 5v
[2023-10-24T03:10:41] Happy Giraffe: 1.5v to 2.1v such a good resolution lmao
[2023-10-24T03:10:58] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-10-24T03:11:58] Happy Giraffe: I only need to show a wild 12v cable and it will listen, knows what happened to its previous friend
[2023-10-24T03:12:19] Happy Giraffe: Almost mis spelled friend-fried but would be even more accurate
[2023-10-24T03:13:39] Happy Giraffe: I think it will be good enough
[2023-10-24T03:14:32] Happy Giraffe: I dont really want torque sensor there
[2023-10-24T03:14:47] Happy Giraffe: Its atm straight to vesc adc 1 as its 3.3v max
[2023-10-24T03:15:43] Happy Giraffe: What kind of?
[2023-10-24T03:16:57] Happy Giraffe: I would set throttle max to 2.2v then
[2023-10-24T03:17:08] Happy Giraffe: And warning to 3.6v
[2023-10-24T03:17:50] Happy Giraffe: I always run it upto 2.2v anyway
[2023-10-24T03:18:16] Happy Giraffe: I dont want to push pedals that hard, millisecond of my own work is too muchüòÇ
[2023-10-24T03:18:46] Happy Giraffe: Nah, im not that brave for sports when on ebike. I will sweat when jogging or gym but not on ebikeüòÇ
[2023-10-24T03:18:52] haku: Is it a common thing for tronic to burn? Ive been seeing alot of those posts.
[2023-10-24T03:19:15] Happy Giraffe: Its better this way, throttle moves to more comfortable position and no accidental presses
[2023-10-24T03:20:15] haku: I see. I wanted to get one in the future honestly. The dual tronic 250 seems cool
[2023-10-24T03:23:08] Happy Giraffe: Now 0.7‚Ç¨ part goes brrr and ready when I wake upüòÅ I love 3D printing
[2023-10-24T03:24:28] haku: I kinda like that or the spintend 84/200. But kinda parainoid to get it from spintend. Thier warranty policy isnt the best.
[2023-10-24T03:25:26] Happy Giraffe: Yeah most vesc have shitty warranties
[2023-10-24T03:25:43] Happy Giraffe: But after solder balls inside are cleaned, spintend is dead reliable
[2023-10-24T03:26:02] Happy Giraffe: Mine did close to 10,000km or 6k miles and died because of my own fault
[2023-10-24T03:26:17] haku: I see. Even my spintend throttle died after less than a month. I dont think they will replace it
[2023-10-24T03:26:53] Happy Giraffe: Thats weirdü§î
[2023-10-24T03:27:05] haku: I like the customer service though amy always have then time to explain things
[2023-10-24T03:27:19] Happy Giraffe: Yeah she tries her bestüòÇ
[2023-10-24T03:27:55] haku: I can imagine 100 vesc noobs like me in her chat logs
[2023-10-24T03:29:44] Happy Giraffe: She is sometimes bit of a noob herself. Asked how I connect a off-on key like this to turn vesc on and she was so confused
[2023-10-24T03:29:56] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_10467@24-10-2023_03-29-56.jpg>
[2023-10-24T03:30:22] Happy Giraffe: Then I got enough and tested stock power button with multimeter and plugged key to same pins lmao

[2023-10-24T06:24:57] haku: And wich countries use that word? Im educating myself.
[2023-10-24T06:35:01] Nick: Have a question. I'll only be running my 200a vesc at a mac of 90a, so is it okay with the ubox 200a to combine both xt90 to one xt90 or would it be better to leave it alone and do a 2x female xt90 into QS8
[2023-10-24T08:22:22] Konstantin: Flipsky survive xD, only 1tvs 5v + swap 5v dc-dc. xD But sometimes, when sh**t like this happened...need to swap mcu xD
[2023-10-24T08:22:45] Konstantin: Probably mcu survive, coz speed was really low ;)
[2023-10-24T09:33:47] Gabe Enzo: not one I've heard.
[2023-10-24T09:34:08] Gabe Enzo: Fuckery is slang in itself, you can't slang a slang

[2023-10-24T10:59:10] haku: Good question. If you are just using 90a. I think 1 xt90 should do it. But if you are planning to push more amps in the future. Remove the xt90s and Soldering thicker cables into a qs8 might be the best option. Im no expert. Wait for others to respond.
[2023-10-24T11:49:47] Happy Giraffe: If you have genuine xt90 then a 5 second peak of 90A will be ok. However the connector is made for 45A continuous so better use both if possible
[2023-10-24T11:52:24] NetworkDir: DMEGC 26E vs LG M26 for 20s?

[2023-10-24T12:03:52] haku: Learned something new. I did not know xt90 only rated for 45a. Thanks. What about qs8 what is the continious rarting?
[2023-10-24T12:04:12] Mirono escooters: I've ran xt90 at way more then that
[2023-10-24T12:04:16] Mirono escooters: Conservative ratings
[2023-10-24T12:06:39] haku: Yea my current battery connection is 2 12awg wires parralel to an xt90. My bms is 90a. I think it should be okay since i dont run it all the way to 90
[2023-10-24T12:06:56] Mirono escooters: Yes, it's perfectly fine
[2023-10-24T12:08:23] haku: What is genuine qs8 rated for?
[2023-10-24T12:08:45] Mirono escooters: "enough" xD

[2023-10-24T14:18:38] Pablo Fernandez: well, after 2 weeks out, rip my nami. almost killed myself lol
[2023-10-24T14:19:40] Pablo Fernandez: had a crash 2 weeks ago lost all the memory so no idea what happened
[2023-10-24T14:20:55] Pablo Fernandez: thankfully i had a motorcicle helmet, still 0.5cm away from killing myself (got hit in the back of the head and got a pretty deep "cut" still with the helmet)
[2023-10-24T14:21:48] Pablo Fernandez: yup, and unconcious for like 5 days
[2023-10-24T14:23:13] Pablo Fernandez: yeah all that matters at the end of the day, thankfully im fine

[2023-10-24T16:05:52] Pablo Fernandez: yeah but shit happens at the end of the day escooters are risky. doctor told me i should be thankfull for having no permanent damage
[2023-10-24T16:06:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What is your status now ,like Home in bed
[2023-10-24T16:07:01] Pablo Fernandez: some burn skin but can walk and do it all already, bit dizzy sometimes but no big deal. have to get checked in a month because i had some blood accumulation in the skull that has to fade away
[2023-10-24T16:07:39] Pablo Fernandez: somehow not a single broken bone
[2023-10-24T16:07:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Honestly this is not sure, till you fully recover,dont want to scare you But i have a mate Moped accident ,back of the head hit Years passed still has short term memory issues ,was Discovered kinda months after
[2023-10-24T16:08:38] Pablo Fernandez: yeah time will tell, back of the head impacts are something to be careful about
[2023-10-24T16:08:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Hope it fades away
[2023-10-24T16:09:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Your helmet had mips?
[2023-10-24T16:10:40] haku: Glad you are okay bud!
[2023-10-24T16:11:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well, front of the head ,isnt any better ,was in bed for a month ,while you are not even able to see the tv coz of blurrY vision üòÖ No broken bones ,not even a scarf But this was like 20 y ago
[2023-10-24T16:12:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And i remember all ,like a slow motion film üòÖüòÖ
[2023-10-24T16:13:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But in my case flexing for bitches was main reason
[2023-10-24T16:14:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What actually happened, felt a half street away üòÖüôà was not funny that time
[2023-10-24T16:17:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Anyway,good that you are getting better now and take your time to recover mate

[2023-10-24T16:42:37] Yamal: FLIPSKY better ?
[2023-10-24T17:45:06] NetworkDir: ?
[2023-10-24T17:45:26] puneDir: Kelly is shit
[2023-10-24T17:45:38] puneDir: Overpriced compared to vesc
[2023-10-24T17:45:43] Mirono escooters: Ye
[2023-10-24T17:45:58] Yamal: üòÅüëç

[2023-10-24T17:48:16] NetworkDir: Vesc firmware > kelly shit firmware
[2023-10-24T17:48:39] Mirono escooters: Is your arrow wrong, or are you stupido
[2023-10-24T17:51:08] NetworkDir: xD
[2023-10-24T17:51:22] Mirono escooters: There you go
[2023-10-24T17:51:22] NetworkDir: Now fixed ? yep
[2023-10-24T18:05:40] Gabe Enzo: Can you push like 9kw with a 7kw ESC or are you not allowed Overwatt
[2023-10-24T18:05:48] Gabe Enzo: like the only issue is heat yeah
[2023-10-24T18:05:51] Gabe Enzo: ?
[2023-10-24T18:05:58] Mirono escooters: MOSFETs blowing lol
[2023-10-24T18:06:05] Mirono escooters: So many factors go into engineering it
[2023-10-24T18:06:34] Gabe Enzo: an 85/100 Controller can technically output 8500w continuously safely tho yes?
[2023-10-24T18:06:44] Gabe Enzo: would you say
[2023-10-24T18:07:04] Mirono escooters: Depends on soooo many factors
[2023-10-24T18:07:24] Gabe Enzo: What should I not cross.
[2023-10-24T18:07:27] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: No, its not only about heat
[2023-10-24T18:07:34] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: There are many factors
[2023-10-24T18:09:44] Mirono escooters: Manufacturing guidelines, since the engineers know a tad better about their esc
[2023-10-24T18:09:45] Mirono escooters: :)
[2023-10-24T18:10:01] Mirono escooters: It's not like they know it handles more, and were like "eh, this is fine"
[2023-10-24T18:16:41] Gabe Enzo: 20s at 100 Amps then lol
[2023-10-24T18:16:47] Gabe Enzo: it's made for it.
[2023-10-24T19:02:05] NetworkDir: Guys this jkbms can give 150A at 20s ? Also bluetooth included or need module
[2023-10-24T19:03:16] NetworkDir: All right
[2023-10-24T19:03:33] NetworkDir: But I don‚Äôt sure it‚Äôs can give 150A at 20s?
[2023-10-24T19:05:00] Mirono escooters: Ya
[2023-10-24T19:05:10] Mirono escooters: Bulit in
[2023-10-24T19:05:21] Mirono escooters: They design such good products But a spell checker..
[2023-10-24T19:46:53] Zak: Use the bloody qs8. Its there for good reason
[2023-10-24T21:15:24] NetworkDir: Any alternative?
[2023-10-24T21:36:03] Gabe Enzo: ant bms
[2023-10-24T21:37:09] Mirono escooters: Ant but jk also good
[2023-10-24T21:37:18] Mirono escooters: Llt for low amp
[2023-10-24T21:37:19] Mirono escooters: "low"
[2023-10-24T21:41:07] NetworkDir: Jk fine
[2023-10-24T21:41:30] NetworkDir: ?
[2023-10-24T21:41:44] puneDir: wish i had known the jk before
[2023-10-24T21:41:56] puneDir: imma put them on my g30
[2023-10-24T21:42:11] NetworkDir: Yeah sadly
[2023-10-24T21:42:30] puneDir: They only have 500 lira of difference
[2023-10-24T21:42:36] NetworkDir: With your shitty 20s daly money you can purchase jk
[2023-10-24T21:42:39] NetworkDir: Yep
[2023-10-24T21:42:55] puneDir: My baks will need active balance for sure
[2023-10-24T21:43:08] NetworkDir: Also it‚Äôs smart active balancer bms More discharge current Also bluetooth app and monitorings
[2023-10-24T21:43:54] puneDir: 40a one is fine if you have 999 external batteries
[2023-10-24T21:43:59] NetworkDir: Your baks with 50 internal resistance 100% need active balancer üòÇüòÇ
[2023-10-24T22:12:15] Davide: I ask european people, someone buy some elettric scooter on max blinker? https://www.maxblinker.com/en/
[2023-10-24T22:31:47] haku: Guys what does the H stand for in motors? 50H, 60H, 70H?
[2023-10-24T22:32:32] puneDir: Magnet size
[2023-10-24T22:32:39] puneDir: Length
[2023-10-24T22:32:57] haku: I see! So the longer the beyter i guess eh?
[2023-10-24T22:33:34] haku: And what unit of measurement is H?
[2023-10-24T22:39:45] NetworkDir: mm
[2023-10-24T22:40:22] NetworkDir: Longer magnets Bigger motor More current?
[2023-10-24T22:42:15] haku: Makes sense. Thanks.
[2023-10-24T22:43:05] haku: I thought its all about the windings.
[2023-10-24T22:43:58] Mirono escooters: Magnet
[2023-10-24T23:01:34] Happy Giraffe: What's that ferrofluid?üòÖ I hope its non conductive like Grin Statorade. Otherwise big boom
[2023-10-24T23:02:03] Happy Giraffe: Rather get the original and tested stuff, this can be anything
[2023-10-24T23:03:23] Mirono escooters: O o
[2023-10-24T23:03:32] Mirono escooters: Low flashing point= much fun!
[2023-10-24T23:04:58] Happy Giraffe: Winding is T where smaller number means faster motor with thicker windings = takes more power in but requires more power for same torque High T version is thinner but more rotations windings. Produces more torque at lower power but heats up quickerüòÅ Fast motor almost always capable of same torque with same heat but requires more phase amps to do so. In scooter world windings usually presented like 22/3 or similar meaning 3T
[2023-10-24T23:05:34] Happy Giraffe: Yeah idk what he does, conducting ferro will do kaboomüòÖ
[2023-10-24T23:06:11] haku: Gotcha. Like qs motors 2.5t or 5t
[2023-10-24T23:07:56] haku: Scooter motor 22/3 that is 3t equivalent?
[2023-10-24T23:09:47] Happy Giraffe: They are bit different ebike vs scooter, my Mxus 3K is 16x4T
[2023-10-24T23:10:00] haku: Gotcha.
[2023-10-24T23:10:17] Happy Giraffe: But idea the same. Haven't looked what turn rate is 3T for ebike
[2023-10-24T23:10:54] Happy Giraffe: Scooter motors sometimes bit smaller in diameter but wider
[2023-10-24T23:11:46] haku: When the windings burn and short does that have an effect on the esc? Will it burn the esc too?
[2023-10-24T23:16:26] Happy Giraffe: @roscheeee you have burned motors, tell himüòÇ
[2023-10-24T23:16:41] Mirono escooters: Esc should be fine
[2023-10-24T23:16:57] Mirono escooters: Since a motor winding is just a big short, in general It has a resistance of like 0.2ohm lol
[2023-10-24T23:18:16] haku: Do scooter peeps use statorade on thier motors?
[2023-10-24T23:18:31] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-10-24T23:18:47] haku: Cool.
[2023-10-24T23:19:44] haku: Too bad you cant put fins like the ones grim sells
[2023-10-24T23:23:24] Mirono escooters: I did on my ebike motor : D But yeh, scoot no possible
[2023-10-24T23:31:14] Happy Giraffe: I would also love to try those later but man are they a police magnet
[2023-10-24T23:41:04] haku: Crazy they wind it by hand. I thought it was winded by machines
[2023-10-24T23:41:51] Mirono escooters: Usually is now
[2023-10-24T23:43:08] haku: But with machine winded stators we can still rewind it by hand if it burns right?
[2023-10-24T23:43:29] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-10-24T23:43:33] Mirono escooters: If you have a lot of time
[2023-10-24T23:43:51] haku: Lol thanks. Sorry for all the questions.
[2023-10-24T23:44:45] Mirono escooters: We all happy to help : D

[2023-10-24T23:56:42] Nick: I just need to create an adapter to connect the 2x xt90 from Spintend into the qs8 on the battery now
[2023-10-24T23:57:07] Nick: I'm not sure what the most graceful way of doing that is though.
[2023-10-24T23:59:33] JPPL: Qs8 have good diameter so 2red + 2black from both xt90 Will be ok. Just solder both xt90 to qs8
[2023-10-25T00:28:12] Happy Giraffe: This is by far the best
[2023-10-25T00:28:59] Happy Giraffe: Get genuine amass connectors, these seem fake
[2023-10-25T00:29:11] Mirono escooters: Amass quality is so good
[2023-10-25T00:29:16] Mirono escooters: It's obvious when 2 next to each other
[2023-10-25T00:29:20] Mirono escooters: I love
[2023-10-25T00:29:41] Happy Giraffe: I use fake xt60 for 10A or soüòÇ
[2023-10-25T00:29:56] Mirono escooters: Me too for random projects
[2023-10-25T00:30:04] Mirono escooters: But cnhl had sale, amass cheaper then ali
[2023-10-25T00:30:11] Mirono escooters: Then you know I got like a hundred
[2023-10-25T00:30:40] Happy Giraffe: And didnt tell usüåö

[2023-10-25T00:36:22] Happy Giraffe: XT120 small plugs seem funny, maybe for temp sensor or something?
[2023-10-25T02:46:42] Happy Giraffe: How strong of a magnetic field is produced by coil of lets say 100A phase to QS205 4T motor? Would the voltage also matter. The motor doesnt have to spin, just to generate the most powerful static fieldü§î To be stupidly simple question, how many KG's of iron could it hold?ü§î

[2023-10-25T07:43:23] Mirono escooters: Have a guess
[2023-10-25T07:43:32] Mirono escooters: Worse build quality and materials
[2023-10-25T07:43:42] Mirono escooters: Should see comparison of the plastic melting too. Big diff
[2023-10-25T08:14:52] Gabe Enzo: There's hard and soft ones, the soft usually being real, as they're nylon
[2023-10-25T08:14:57] Gabe Enzo: nylon is like super soft
[2023-10-25T08:29:54] Mirono escooters: I wouldnt take that for granted

[2023-10-25T08:44:04] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: A start without blowups
[2023-10-25T08:44:20] Gabe Enzo: Yes
[2023-10-25T08:44:25] Gabe Enzo: which I hope you will help me with
[2023-10-25T08:44:29] Gabe Enzo: Lol
[2023-10-25T08:44:35] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: My journey started on first day blowing up a whole PCB
[2023-10-25T08:44:45] Gabe Enzo: How can I avoid that?
[2023-10-25T08:44:52] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: You already did
[2023-10-25T08:45:05] Gabe Enzo: how did you manage to f it up?
[2023-10-25T08:45:10] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: It was just me, 75100 and phase filters enabled
[2023-10-25T08:45:19] Gabe Enzo: Lmao flipsky.
[2023-10-25T08:45:24] Gabe Enzo: anyway what's a phase filter?
[2023-10-25T08:45:26] Gabe Enzo: ...
[2023-10-25T08:45:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: You got them, don't worry about it.
[2023-10-25T08:55:50] Gabe Enzo: @kawaiinekololis I've just realised this ESC has no screw base. how am I meant to put it on the pro 2?
[2023-10-25T08:56:34] Gabe Enzo: Just sticky thermal pads and a prop seems fine but that would be paranoid as hell lol
[2023-10-25T09:00:31] Mirono escooters: Thermal glue
[2023-10-25T09:00:34] Mirono escooters: 3dp adaptor
[2023-10-25T09:00:45] Mirono escooters: Or take ideas from @KierreKikkeli
[2023-10-25T09:48:25] Finn: Where did you buy it
[2023-10-25T10:10:35] NetworkDir: Hmm any link at AliExpress/Amazon?

[2023-10-25T11:03:21] Gabe Enzo: Ya
[2023-10-25T11:03:40] Gabe Enzo: Literally
[2023-10-25T11:20:08] haku: Thats awsome. Are there mounting holes?
[2023-10-25T11:21:40] haku: I shouldve gotten these instead. This is the best bang per buck according to the folks here

[2023-10-25T11:58:51] Happy Giraffe: Yes
[2023-10-25T11:59:37] haku: Yep shipping kills the deal for me.
[2023-10-25T11:59:45] Happy Giraffe: If motor sealed well with silicon the 10ml will be enough for 4-5 years
[2023-10-25T12:00:13] Happy Giraffe: First put like 6 and add 2ml every 3 years
[2023-10-25T12:01:10] haku: Is this for a ebike or scooter?
[2023-10-25T12:02:22] NetworkDir: Does ferrofluid have an effect on power and performance except for a colder motor?
[2023-10-25T12:02:40] NetworkDir: Stupid question
[2023-10-25T12:03:00] NetworkDir: Cold motor = high performance motor
[2023-10-25T12:10:10] Happy Giraffe: Both motors, is motor is smaller like Xiaomi then maybe 4-5ml
[2023-10-25T12:10:53] francois schempers: Well in my case, with FW my motor deeps into the 140¬∞c so I can't run it too long, with ferro I migh be able to
[2023-10-25T12:11:09] Happy Giraffe: If you put all 10ml it will introduce some drag. If you put right amount then its not noticeable
[2023-10-25T12:11:40] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, and with ferro not to run past magnet temp ratingüòÖ
[2023-10-25T12:15:00] heimdler: Anyone here rides a vsett? I want to ask about the notch thing when turning left and right. It makes riding kind of tricky when turning
[2023-10-25T12:15:29] heimdler: Do you remove it or steer with your weight?
[2023-10-25T12:17:12] Mirono escooters: Rip beari'g maybe
[2023-10-25T12:20:39] heimdler: No, it's like to keep the scooter going straight
[2023-10-25T12:21:31] heimdler: Both the units also like that
[2023-10-25T12:21:51] Mirono escooters: Is it a newer version
[2023-10-25T12:22:01] Mirono escooters: Would be stupid way to fix wobble

[2023-10-25T12:25:04] heimdler: Mileage not even 15km
[2023-10-25T12:25:32] heimdler: I guess it's just unique to this clone. Better swap the stem
[2023-10-25T12:27:48] heimdler: Ones came with 800w, another is 500w. One is performance the other is mileage
[2023-10-25T12:28:01] Mirono escooters: Ultra smooth suspension escooter xd
[2023-10-25T12:29:39] Happy Giraffe: Then anything is possible

[2023-10-25T12:31:43] heimdler: Suspension is fine, it's the steering
[2023-10-25T12:32:01] heimdler: Got to steer harder left or right to turn
[2023-10-25T12:32:16] heimdler: To push past that gap
[2023-10-25T12:32:21] Happy Giraffe: Yeah I'm just worried about the overall construction
[2023-10-25T12:33:20] heimdler: Then because of that, rider would push to hard and over steer
[2023-10-25T12:33:45] heimdler: With the tiny 8.5", the ride becomes highly unstable
[2023-10-25T12:36:27] heimdler: Wtf it's not even 8.5", its 8" rear
[2023-10-25T12:53:29] heimdler: Hmm ok I'll check that part out

[2023-10-25T14:04:07] Mirono escooters: We need to make a tldr with graphs and sources xD
[2023-10-25T14:05:21] Gabe Enzo: why did no one talk about it in m365 chat.
[2023-10-25T14:05:24] Gabe Enzo: Lol
[2023-10-25T14:11:00] Mirono escooters: Because ferrofluiding a m365 motor is stupid?
[2023-10-25T14:11:17] Mirono escooters: And search for ferrofluid, plenty stories xd
[2023-10-25T14:35:22] Gabe Enzo: @kawaiinekololis the holes are there
[2023-10-25T14:35:26] Gabe Enzo: but I can't mount it unless I drill thru the deck
[2023-10-25T14:36:14] Rogerio Figueiredo: How
[2023-10-25T14:36:25] Rogerio Figueiredo: Where is that in menus?
[2023-10-25T14:36:36] Rogerio Figueiredo: U need to have dual motor to use that right?
[2023-10-25T14:44:37] Gabe Enzo: No lol
[2023-10-25T14:44:59] Gabe Enzo: isn't it abs
[2023-10-25T14:45:11] Gabe Enzo: I can screw it to the frame easily.

[2023-10-25T15:05:08] Oreo huzky: Usually white is temp
[2023-10-25T15:05:27] Gabe Enzo: Planning to kill this motor
[2023-10-25T15:05:29] Gabe Enzo: Idm
[2023-10-25T15:05:40] Gabe Enzo: It can get as hot as it wants. I'm calling a cab when it does.
[2023-10-25T15:05:46] Oreo huzky: Just wire gnd positive and hall cables
[2023-10-25T15:06:06] Oreo huzky: What voltage do you use ?
[2023-10-25T15:06:10] Gabe Enzo: 72v.
[2023-10-25T15:06:16] Gabe Enzo: on a 300w.
[2023-10-25T15:06:23] Gabe Enzo: Telling you now it's not as lame as it seems
[2023-10-25T15:06:32] Gabe Enzo: It's fun as shit
[2023-10-25T15:06:44] Oreo huzky: If you want to kill it set dc current to 120A and phase current to 250A
[2023-10-25T15:06:56] Gabe Enzo: Batt can't go above 40a.
[2023-10-25T15:07:03] Gabe Enzo: 10s Xiaomi batt
[2023-10-25T15:07:07] Oreo huzky: Then hard to kill it
[2023-10-25T15:07:18] Gabe Enzo: 2880w in a 300w is nice
[2023-10-25T15:07:25] Gabe Enzo: takes a few weeks
[2023-10-25T15:07:27] Oreo huzky: Only do that if you really want to destroy it
[2023-10-25T15:07:29] Gabe Enzo: I only need it for a month
[2023-10-25T15:07:39] Gabe Enzo: after that I'm getting a fat motor.
[2023-10-25T15:07:51] Gabe Enzo: Will vesc get fucked if the motor shorts?

[2023-10-25T15:16:24] Gabe Enzo: Lmao, I'll barely be pushing 1kw constant
[2023-10-25T15:16:27] Gabe Enzo: Less.
[2023-10-25T15:16:31] Gabe Enzo: 700.
[2023-10-25T15:19:42] francois schempers: If its a xiaomi bat, you have in fact 20A max, the 44A are unlocked if the bms can chat with a xiaomi controller, or a rita
[2023-10-25T15:19:52] Gabe Enzo: Shunted batteries.
[2023-10-25T15:19:57] Gabe Enzo: Pro 2 can output 40a constant.

[2023-10-25T15:41:57] Rogerio Figueiredo: Only 19a
[2023-10-25T15:51:11] francois schempers: Well if he shunted the battery and bypass the bms discharge, he can, not that safe, but he can
[2023-10-25T15:51:43] puneDir: Shunt is not same as bypass
[2023-10-25T15:55:03] Rogerio Figueiredo: Bypass yes

[2023-10-25T15:56:02] Finn: Because of cutoff

[2023-10-25T16:12:53] Rogerio Figueiredo: The cut was because the controllers wasn't the original
[2023-10-25T16:13:02] puneDir: Yeah ik

[2023-10-25T17:12:06] KierreKikkeli: but at most it'll fit a battery same size as the essential as the controller is on the back with adc
[2023-10-25T17:15:32] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2023-10-25T17:15:45] Gabe Enzo: Gonna Dremel that off now
[2023-10-25T17:15:56] KierreKikkeli: how you gonnna attach it tho
[2023-10-25T17:17:23] KierreKikkeli: the holes on the back of it dont go through the vesc plate so you would need to attach it by drilling a hole through the deck, unless your gonna use the clamp method or thermal paste glue
[2023-10-25T17:19:10] KierreKikkeli: also power the vesc first on, then connect it to your pc via usb c and turn bluetooth permanently on
[2023-10-25T17:19:44] KierreKikkeli: otherwise you might be in a pickle trying to configure it when its mounted
[2023-10-25T17:19:53] KierreKikkeli: all hail the james
[2023-10-25T17:20:18] KierreKikkeli: XDDDDDDD
[2023-10-25T17:20:29] KierreKikkeli: better then me connecting the module on the comm port at first xd
[2023-10-25T17:21:18] KierreKikkeli: then being confused for a day or 2 about what i do with the adc
[2023-10-25T17:21:40] Gabe Enzo: @kwawaiinekololis how do I wire the pro Dashboard to this vesc.
[2023-10-25T17:21:44] Finn: why not get alu plate and mount it to the bottom of the scooter
[2023-10-25T17:21:46] Gabe Enzo: Anything I need a pc for???
[2023-10-25T17:21:55] Gabe Enzo: I have no angle grinder
[2023-10-25T17:21:59] Finn: 1k ohm between green and 3,3v
[2023-10-25T17:22:02] Gabe Enzo: I have an alu plate.
[2023-10-25T17:22:27] Finn: why you need that
[2023-10-25T17:22:31] Gabe Enzo: Don't have that on hand.
[2023-10-25T17:22:37] Gabe Enzo: Alu plate duh
[2023-10-25T17:22:44] Finn: for cutting the plate?
[2023-10-25T17:22:45] Finn: oh
[2023-10-25T17:22:46] Finn: rip
[2023-10-25T17:22:54] Gabe Enzo: this should work tho no problem
[2023-10-25T17:23:01] Finn: also angle grinder works better
[2023-10-25T17:23:02] Gabe Enzo: thermal paste
[2023-10-25T17:23:09] Gabe Enzo: You can't get it in there
[2023-10-25T17:23:13] Gabe Enzo: need a dremel
[2023-10-25T17:23:15] Finn: for fixing?
[2023-10-25T17:23:19] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_10499@25-10-2023_17-15-45.jpg>
[2023-10-25T17:23:28] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_10501@25-10-2023_17-23-28.jpg>
[2023-10-25T17:23:41] Gabe Enzo: I haven't got that heh
[2023-10-25T17:23:50] Gabe Enzo: might be forced to use no dash
[2023-10-25T17:23:51] KierreKikkeli: lidl tools les goo
[2023-10-25T17:24:09] Gabe Enzo: Lidl welder Lidl soldering iron Lidl drill
[2023-10-25T17:24:16] Gabe Enzo: kek
[2023-10-25T17:24:16] KierreKikkeli: yeah it needs some coding and stuff while using the adc with it might result in some wackiness
[2023-10-25T17:24:34] KierreKikkeli: hence i abandoned the idea and got myself a waterproof phone case for bicycles
[2023-10-25T17:24:35] Gabe Enzo: No time for that, gotta get to college tomorrow lfmao.
[2023-10-25T17:24:46] Gabe Enzo: Guess no dash it is
[2023-10-25T17:24:49] KierreKikkeli: XD
[2023-10-25T17:25:07] Gabe Enzo: Do you think these 14awg will melt?
[2023-10-25T17:25:12] Gabe Enzo: 40a thru them
[2023-10-25T17:25:14] Gabe Enzo: well peak
[2023-10-25T17:25:30] Gabe Enzo: Batt 14awg
[2023-10-25T17:25:49] Gabe Enzo: only 8cm long
[2023-10-25T17:25:49] KierreKikkeli: i have no clue about those so youd be better off asking someone like james
[2023-10-25T17:26:15] Finn: doesnt the ubox has awg 10 as power?
[2023-10-25T17:26:24] Gabe Enzo: ya but my batteries don't
[2023-10-25T17:26:30] Finn: just adapt it
[2023-10-25T17:26:33] Gabe Enzo: I only got 14awg atm
[2023-10-25T17:26:36] Finn: how much your battery can handle?
[2023-10-25T17:26:39] Gabe Enzo: 40a.
[2023-10-25T17:26:44] KierreKikkeli: but if 10awg on the ubox power input is enough for 100A, 40A should do with 14awg id assume
[2023-10-25T17:26:56] Finn: hm yeah
[2023-10-25T17:27:09] Finn: i use awg 12 for normal series xiaomi and ninebot
[2023-10-25T17:27:14] Finn: awg14 little smol
[2023-10-25T17:27:23] Gabe Enzo: It is I wanted to double up but too lazy
[2023-10-25T17:27:26] Gabe Enzo: Lmao
[2023-10-25T17:27:29] Gabe Enzo: I'll risk it.
[2023-10-25T17:27:31] Finn: double?
[2023-10-25T17:27:39] Gabe Enzo: When in doubt double up I guess
[2023-10-25T17:27:41] Finn: so two awg14 per + and -
[2023-10-25T17:27:44] Gabe Enzo: Ya
[2023-10-25T17:27:50] Finn: dont do that
[2023-10-25T17:27:59] Gabe Enzo: How is it any different
[2023-10-25T17:28:04] Gabe Enzo: Lol
[2023-10-25T17:28:07] Finn: just use one wire
[2023-10-25T17:28:53] KierreKikkeli: different lengths could result in different amount of power/A going through em?
[2023-10-25T17:29:15] Finn: have to do with resistance on the soldering points
[2023-10-25T17:29:16] KierreKikkeli: or any difference in the wires will/can result in difference of power delivery between the 2
[2023-10-25T17:29:18] Finn: isnt ideal
[2023-10-25T17:29:35] KierreKikkeli: that too
[2023-10-25T17:29:42] Finn: nah it always will split up same on both
[2023-10-25T17:29:47] Finn: except their lengh differ
[2023-10-25T17:30:00] Finn: resistance is different and so on
[2023-10-25T17:30:39] KierreKikkeli: ah yea, my bad, meant resistance not power and amps üòÖ
[2023-10-25T17:41:00] Gabe Enzo: the electrons take the shortest way
[2023-10-25T17:41:10] Gabe Enzo: there is no difference
[2023-10-25T17:41:17] Finn: no difference??
[2023-10-25T17:41:20] Happy Giraffe: Tldr about 15% more cooling power for motor. Risk is running motor past magnet temps as now magnets absorb heat easier
[2023-10-25T17:41:28] Gabe Enzo: other than it looking like shit
[2023-10-25T17:41:28] Gabe Enzo: Yes.
[2023-10-25T17:41:30] Finn: so you would say solder is the same as a copper wire in conductivity?
[2023-10-25T17:41:46] Gabe Enzo: They should be pre intertwined before soldering
[2023-10-25T17:41:54] Gabe Enzo: obvi
[2023-10-25T17:41:57] Finn: still better to use one single wire
[2023-10-25T17:42:06] Gabe Enzo: Yes.
[2023-10-25T17:44:30] Happy Giraffe: I didnt mess with permanent uart, that I already know. But the pairing done settings is assüòÇ
[2023-10-25T17:45:23] KierreKikkeli: kinda wish there was an autoconnect feature
[2023-10-25T17:45:44] Happy Giraffe: I was thinking as Im now paired with BT it automatically makes current device setup...
[2023-10-25T18:06:11] KierreKikkeli: i wonder if running a straight usb c to c from the ubox to a phone would autoconnect it while reading current device setup with the added bonus of charging your phone ü§î

[2023-10-25T18:10:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: @kawaiinekololis TikTok hHaha
[2023-10-25T18:18:49] Rogerio Figueiredo: Where do you out the battery?
[2023-10-25T18:22:25] Mirono escooters: Omg such waste
[2023-10-25T18:35:02] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_10503@25-10-2023_18-35-02.jpg>
[2023-10-25T18:35:07] Gabe Enzo: 90% down
[2023-10-25T18:43:12] KierreKikkeli: wildman bag
[2023-10-25T18:44:40] KierreKikkeli: necessary place holder wires and such for now, might make space afterwards for a battery if and when i can afford upgrading the external one
[2023-10-25T18:44:53] Mirono escooters: Fair enough
[2023-10-25T18:47:26] KierreKikkeli: but then again the laws and such are starting to change here while my whole apt congress dislikes the fact i bring my scoot inside, and when im gonna register it as a moped i might get banned from bringing it in the apt, so with those in mind an internal battery might not even make much practical sense
[2023-10-25T18:48:42] KierreKikkeli: *i live on the nice old apartments full of retired city grannies that wanna cause issues just because they can but fear me enough to leave me mostly alone xd*
[2023-10-25T18:49:11] Mirono escooters: Ah, entitled old people
[2023-10-25T18:49:23] Mirono escooters: They are always bored
[2023-10-25T18:49:38] KierreKikkeli: yeah, it seems like living in the city your whole life makes your brains rot at older age for some reason
[2023-10-25T18:50:35] KierreKikkeli: a month ago my senile downstairs neighbour stalked the corridors for hours until i went out just to complain to me how im leaving the front door open coz of my scoot
[2023-10-25T18:50:39] Mirono escooters: Tbh, I'd become a grumpy old man too if I lived in the city
[2023-10-25T18:50:45] KierreKikkeli: we have automatic doors......
[2023-10-25T18:50:54] Mirono escooters: Humans aren't made for it. Everyone is breathing in each other's necks, annoying everyone.
[2023-10-25T18:50:55] KierreKikkeli: i had to evacuate for 6 months......
[2023-10-25T18:51:04] KierreKikkeli: yeah
[2023-10-25T18:51:07] Mirono escooters: Wtf xD
[2023-10-25T18:51:25] KierreKikkeli: she also added she has been on the watch every day coz i leave the door open
[2023-10-25T18:51:42] KierreKikkeli: which i found odd given that i didnt even live here for half a year XD
[2023-10-25T18:52:18] KierreKikkeli: upstairs neighbour made a formal complaint coz my scoot was making the corridors dirty a year ago
[2023-10-25T18:52:30] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2023-10-25T18:52:32] Mirono escooters: Retards
[2023-10-25T18:52:37] KierreKikkeli: -there was a handful of rain water on the corridor floor
[2023-10-25T18:52:50] KierreKikkeli: that came from my boots not even the scoot XD
[2023-10-25T18:52:52] Mirono escooters: That's like the point of a corridor
[2023-10-25T18:53:12] KierreKikkeli: yeah, and theres no mats or anything so the dirt just stays there
[2023-10-25T18:53:23] KierreKikkeli: and a cleaner cleans the whole space twice a week anyways
[2023-10-25T18:53:29] KierreKikkeli: <animation>
[2023-10-25T18:55:02] KierreKikkeli: could give a handful other weird examples like how they forced everyone to take the fake plants, door decour and basement hanging lounge away by complaining enough to the fire dept and stuff like that
[2023-10-25T18:56:39] KierreKikkeli: "ah yes the fire hazard sofa right under multiple sprinklers in an enclosed cement basement no one has ever used for anything"
[2023-10-25T18:57:03] Mirono escooters: Move out When ya can
[2023-10-25T18:57:08] KierreKikkeli: wont
[2023-10-25T18:57:12] Mirono escooters: No way. I ever live in a flat for long
[2023-10-25T18:57:14] Mirono escooters: I wouldnt handle it
[2023-10-25T18:57:27] KierreKikkeli: its an old industrial apt complex
[2023-10-25T18:57:51] KierreKikkeli: one half is stores and stuff, and the apt complex used to be workers home
[2023-10-25T18:58:08] KierreKikkeli: aka free water, industrial water pressure and electricity, sound isolated very thick walls, a ton of common usability rooms like a freezing room, industrial drying room, underground garage, under ground basement, normal basement and a few others
[2023-10-25T19:00:02] Mirono escooters: That's handy
[2023-10-25T19:00:12] KierreKikkeli: also the apt iself is amazing
[2023-10-25T19:00:18] KierreKikkeli: indeed
[2023-10-25T19:00:56] KierreKikkeli: fought tooth and nail with the estate agent for months about this apt until i just directly contacted the land lord and got it XD
[2023-10-25T19:02:51] KierreKikkeli: land lord is also an amazing old man who built the first and only succesful media/printing company here so we have a common working industry
[2023-10-25T19:03:15] KierreKikkeli: like hell im giving up on this place, too good for that
[2023-10-25T19:06:02] KierreKikkeli: also darkwood aesthetic furnishing with a sauna and parquet right on the center of town for 400‚Ç¨/month
[2023-10-25T19:06:41] Finn: Works like a charm
[2023-10-25T19:06:52] Finn: Usb c fast charging while on the scooterüòÇ
[2023-10-25T19:07:21] KierreKikkeli: yeah main point was for the vesc to autoconnect to the phone while any charging would be a +
[2023-10-25T19:08:35] KierreKikkeli: damn
[2023-10-25T19:08:49] Finn: Yeeah
[2023-10-25T19:08:55] Gabe Enzo: Guys
[2023-10-25T19:09:02] Gabe Enzo: need help
[2023-10-25T19:09:13] Gabe Enzo: How to get this out
[2023-10-25T19:09:24] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_10504@25-10-2023_19-09-24.jpg>
[2023-10-25T19:09:36] Finn: I tested it the whole 30m while i was on a tour with two friends
[2023-10-25T19:09:39] Mirono escooters: Not, tis glued
[2023-10-25T19:09:42] Mirono escooters: Why try remove?
[2023-10-25T19:09:45] Finn: You cantüíÄ
[2023-10-25T19:10:07] Gabe Enzo: Because the bottom base is the only way to screw it in and for me to map the dimension's, I would need to use a pen on the metal through the piece.
[2023-10-25T19:10:08] KierreKikkeli: the holes on the back arent going through it
[2023-10-25T19:10:17] KierreKikkeli: as i said previously
[2023-10-25T19:10:24] Gabe Enzo: not what I mean
[2023-10-25T19:11:06] KierreKikkeli: for mapping just have it completely intact, thats how i did it
[2023-10-25T19:11:22] Gabe Enzo: <voice_message>
[2023-10-25T19:11:35] Finn: Show the bottom
[2023-10-25T19:11:59] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_10505@25-10-2023_19-11-59.jpg>
[2023-10-25T19:12:01] KierreKikkeli: why what?
[2023-10-25T19:12:35] Gabe Enzo: no other way to drill
[2023-10-25T19:12:46] KierreKikkeli: dont ruin the alu block
[2023-10-25T19:12:53] Gabe Enzo: not planning to
[2023-10-25T19:13:01] Gabe Enzo: it comes with 4 screw holes.
[2023-10-25T19:13:04] KierreKikkeli: attach it with either thermal glue, clamp or do as i did
[2023-10-25T19:13:06] Gabe Enzo: I just Wana map the holes
[2023-10-25T19:13:18] Gabe Enzo: Too simplistic. also got no thermal glue
[2023-10-25T19:13:21] KierreKikkeli: youd need to drill through the scoot deck to get em on
[2023-10-25T19:13:25] Gabe Enzo: I know
[2023-10-25T19:13:33] KierreKikkeli: dont?
[2023-10-25T19:13:43] Gabe Enzo: I do what I want
[2023-10-25T19:13:54] Gabe Enzo: With the resources I have on hand
[2023-10-25T19:14:10] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_10496@25-10-2023_16-47-31.jpg>
[2023-10-25T19:14:39] KierreKikkeli: you have 60+mm m 2.5 screws?
[2023-10-25T19:14:43] Gabe Enzo: No materials for that haha
[2023-10-25T19:14:52] Gabe Enzo: Huh ye
[2023-10-25T19:14:57] Gabe Enzo: 3
[2023-10-25T19:14:59] Gabe Enzo: 3mm
[2023-10-25T19:15:09] Mirono escooters: My 2 braincells talking to eachother at 3am:
[2023-10-25T19:15:18] KierreKikkeli: i just bought a 0,20‚Ç¨ nail board and used the monorimm carrot drill bit
[2023-10-25T19:16:31] KierreKikkeli: welp, if you want to map the holes stuff, trace its dimensions on paper, tape the paper to the box, find screw holes and poke em through the paper
[2023-10-25T19:18:15] KierreKikkeli: drilling through the deck still a bad idea as it makes it less water resistant and weaker to bending and or breaking
[2023-10-25T19:18:52] KierreKikkeli: as in
[2023-10-25T19:18:56] Gabe Enzo: Lmao
[2023-10-25T19:19:02] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_10508@25-10-2023_19-19-02.jpg>
[2023-10-25T19:19:06] Gabe Enzo: already am.
[2023-10-25T19:19:58] KierreKikkeli: then why did you want to open it in the first place? xd
[2023-10-25T19:22:53] Gabe Enzo: Wanted to make it easier.
[2023-10-25T19:23:03] Gabe Enzo: Ive a project at uni due tomorrow.
[2023-10-25T19:23:07] Gabe Enzo: not much time.
[2023-10-25T19:24:16] Eric Howat: <photos/photo_10509@25-10-2023_19-24-16.jpg>
[2023-10-25T19:24:25] Eric Howat: Anyone know dimensions and specs of this battery?
[2023-10-25T19:39:19] Eric Howat: Also what‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs favorite charge-only BMS that‚Äôs VESC compatible?
[2023-10-25T19:40:59] Mirono escooters: Vesc compatible BMSes are super rare
[2023-10-25T19:41:04] Mirono escooters: We all use Bluetooth BMSes afaik
[2023-10-25T19:41:44] Eric Howat: I was thinking this https://trampaboards.com/vesc-based-bms--balance-charges-up-to-18s-x435-p-35545.html
[2023-10-25T19:41:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ennoid bms
[2023-10-25T19:42:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: Discharge protection possible too with relay
[2023-10-25T20:40:26] Gabe Enzo: anyone know why no turn on?
[2023-10-25T20:40:41] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2023-10-25T20:42:00] Happy Giraffe: Maybe the full adroid version not mobileüò≥ But thats ass to use
[2023-10-25T20:43:07] Gabe Enzo: it has a bluetooth module
[2023-10-25T20:43:12] Gabe Enzo: sadly realized just now vesc is paid
[2023-10-25T20:43:13] Gabe Enzo: Lol

[2023-10-25T21:13:51] Happy Giraffe: Playstore easy updateds etc
[2023-10-25T21:14:05] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2023-10-25T21:14:21] Mirono escooters: It costs something to have it on there You pay for the convenience
[2023-10-25T21:14:29] Mirono escooters: Vedder is so cool tho, that he devd all that

[2023-10-25T21:21:47] Mirono escooters: From the Vedder site, lol
[2023-10-25T21:26:53] Jan: Sadly?? That guy is literally putting thousands of hours of development for free to make the scooter community even happen. He even makes an addon app for live stats display and 5‚Ç¨ is unfortunate??
[2023-10-25T21:29:29] Gabe Enzo: Think this esc is dead on arrival lmao @kawaiinekololis
[2023-10-25T21:29:41] Mirono escooters: Hahahaha my thoughts
[2023-10-25T21:29:46] Mirono escooters: Cant be serious you
[2023-10-25T21:29:59] Gabe Enzo: I didn't short it I swear
[2023-10-25T21:30:05] Gabe Enzo: No joke
[2023-10-25T21:30:22] Mirono escooters: And you read through the manual and figured the power button out?
[2023-10-25T21:30:51] Gabe Enzo: Ya
[2023-10-25T21:31:02] Gabe Enzo: Just 20s connected, that's it.
[2023-10-25T21:31:11] Juice: looking at your video
[2023-10-25T21:31:14] Juice: thats a ubox?

[2023-10-25T21:31:35] Gabe Enzo: I have no pc
[2023-10-25T21:31:40] Mirono escooters: I think this group will have its hands full with electrons first vesc
[2023-10-25T21:32:04] Juice: mine didnt need a pc?
[2023-10-25T21:32:17] Juice: i dont think you can use it with pc without it turned on anyway
[2023-10-25T21:32:32] Juice: mine worked fine after connecting power supply and the button it came with
[2023-10-25T21:32:36] Juice: nothing connected yet
[2023-10-25T21:33:09] Gabe Enzo: Ya 100% not turning on
[2023-10-25T21:33:35] Mirono escooters: How üíÄ

[2023-10-25T21:33:46] Juice: what is that ubox though? it looks so different
[2023-10-25T21:33:58] Juice: oh 80v 100a
[2023-10-25T21:34:08] Gabe Enzo: It flashed for a tad second
[2023-10-25T21:34:20] Gabe Enzo: green this time
[2023-10-25T21:34:21] Gabe Enzo: hm
[2023-10-25T21:34:22] Juice: maybe button is just broken
[2023-10-25T21:34:39] Gabe Enzo: I have another ignition I bought weeks prior and idk how to install it
[2023-10-25T21:34:43] Gabe Enzo: it's the same design that spintend sells
[2023-10-25T21:34:48] Gabe Enzo: but they have another connector
[2023-10-25T21:35:22] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_10510@25-10-2023_21-35-22.jpg>
[2023-10-25T21:35:43] Mirono escooters: I doubt it's ur ignition
[2023-10-25T21:35:53] Mirono escooters: How sure are you your batt works üòÇ
[2023-10-25T21:35:55] Gabe Enzo: i hsvent used it
[2023-10-25T21:35:59] Gabe Enzo: havent
[2023-10-25T21:36:07] Gabe Enzo: Buttom flashes
[2023-10-25T21:36:21] Gabe Enzo: I'm saying maybe installing the ignition will turn it on
[2023-10-25T21:37:18] Mirono escooters: SPintend didn't deliver ignition?
[2023-10-25T21:37:34] Gabe Enzo: .
[2023-10-25T21:37:42] Gabe Enzo: didn't bother buying their one
[2023-10-25T21:37:46] Gabe Enzo: it looked the same as the one I have
[2023-10-25T21:37:54] Gabe Enzo: except connector
[2023-10-25T21:38:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: My Spintend button was defective, it might be the same in your case @Megacorporate
[2023-10-25T21:38:07] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_10511@25-10-2023_21-38-07.jpg>
[2023-10-25T21:38:16] Gabe Enzo: lmao
[2023-10-25T21:38:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ignition and button are in parallel
[2023-10-25T21:38:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: So one of them shorted is enough
[2023-10-25T21:38:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: U bought it brand new?
[2023-10-25T21:38:43] Gabe Enzo: Would you say this ignition is the same?
[2023-10-25T21:38:44] Gabe Enzo: Ya
[2023-10-25T21:38:53] Mirono escooters: So we surprised its not turning on when the ignotion isn't on?
[2023-10-25T21:39:08] Gabe Enzo: I thought you choose either ignition or button
[2023-10-25T21:39:17] Gabe Enzo: personally.
[2023-10-25T21:40:06] Gabe Enzo: My ignition differs from the spintend one
[2023-10-25T21:40:21] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_10512@25-10-2023_21-40-21.jpg>
[2023-10-25T21:40:31] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_10513@25-10-2023_21-40-31.jpg>
[2023-10-25T21:40:48] Gabe Enzo: Don't wanna fuck it up
[2023-10-25T21:42:13] Gabe Enzo: dude I wouldve assumed only green is white
[2023-10-25T21:42:14] Gabe Enzo: zLol
[2023-10-25T21:42:27] Mirono escooters: Never assume
[2023-10-25T21:55:00] Gabe Enzo: works now
[2023-10-25T21:55:04] Gabe Enzo: ignition shows 0
[2023-10-25T21:55:06] Gabe Enzo: which is odd
[2023-10-25T21:55:27] Gabe Enzo: 3.7 to 3.5 to zero
[2023-10-25T21:56:51] Gabe Enzo: batt multimeter still shows 81v
[2023-10-25T21:57:18] puneDir: U connected it wrong
[2023-10-25T21:58:10] puneDir: maybe
[2023-10-25T21:58:11] puneDir: idk
[2023-10-25T21:59:05] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_10514@25-10-2023_21-59-05.jpg>
[2023-10-25T21:59:08] Gabe Enzo: I didn't know this
[2023-10-25T21:59:32] Gabe Enzo: Where am I meant to get 5v from lmao
[2023-10-25T22:03:52] Gabe Enzo: Ya
[2023-10-25T22:04:04] Gabe Enzo: the port that spintend sows
[2023-10-25T22:04:05] Gabe Enzo: shows
[2023-10-25T22:04:19] Gabe Enzo: that.
[2023-10-25T22:06:22] NetworkDir: Interesting
[2023-10-25T22:15:43] KierreKikkeli: same as with mine? aka faulty power button solder
[2023-10-25T22:20:25] KierreKikkeli: as they dont even bother using connectors, just very thin wires barely soldered to the pins with 0,000001g of tin
[2023-10-25T22:20:27] haku: For me i have to hold it for 2 secs
[2023-10-25T22:20:29] Mirono escooters: I'm thinking batt goes in protection
[2023-10-25T22:30:55] Gabe Enzo: Nothing has shorted Made sure of it.
[2023-10-25T22:31:41] Gabe Enzo: Kinda what's happening to me now
[2023-10-25T22:35:38] Happy Giraffe: He can just short the cables SWT and GND from PWR button port
[2023-10-25T22:35:48] Happy Giraffe: Highly doubt button broken
[2023-10-25T22:36:23] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Nah happens.
[2023-10-25T22:48:19] Happy Giraffe: And you are sure you plugged power button there?
[2023-10-25T22:48:45] Happy Giraffe: There have been people here trying to force 4-pin cables to 5-pin connectors on vesc...
[2023-10-25T22:50:54] Gabe Enzo: Ya
[2023-10-25T22:50:59] Gabe Enzo: not that dumj
[2023-10-26T01:04:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: Molicel p45b, best cell ever
[2023-10-26T01:04:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: Resistance even lower than SAMSUNG 30T, with 1500mAh more capacity
[2023-10-26T01:07:57] haku: Is this a good idea making a custom harness for adc adapter with jst2.0.
[2023-10-26T01:08:55] haku: Yes it is. Unfortunately its double the price of p42 here in the US
[2023-10-26T01:09:52] Pablo Fernandez: how much is it there? here is about 8$ a cell
[2023-10-26T01:15:09] haku: <photos/photo_10518@26-10-2023_01-15-09.jpg>
[2023-10-26T01:16:56] haku: Too rich for my blood
[2023-10-26T01:28:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: Europe against more expensive
[2023-10-26T01:30:16] haku: Oh ok. Why is it so pricey?
[2023-10-26T01:30:26] francois schempers: less expensive on nkon
[2023-10-26T01:30:29] francois schempers: <photos/photo_10519@26-10-2023_01-30-29.jpg>
[2023-10-26T01:30:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: Normal, material more expensive , so final price more expensive
[2023-10-26T01:30:52] Happy Giraffe: Yes because Nkon includes tax‚ù§Ô∏è
[2023-10-26T01:31:32] Happy Giraffe: Top product always has to have some price gap tooüòÇ
[2023-10-26T01:31:40] Happy Giraffe: RTX4080-4090üòÅ
[2023-10-26T01:32:31] francois schempers: we could bunch up together to make a big order and get better prices, we did that in the past to get lots of monorim stuff cheaper
[2023-10-26T01:33:10] haku: Thats true. Best high discharge cell. Im about bang for buck.
[2023-10-26T01:33:39] francois schempers: then 40T is your best bet
[2023-10-26T01:34:18] haku: I had that choice when it was on sale for 2.99 a piece. Im set on p42
[2023-10-26T01:34:29] haku: Waiting for black friday sale

[2023-10-26T01:35:19] haku: Thinking about it i shouldve gotten it. I would have a pack by now
[2023-10-26T01:35:43] francois schempers: yeah 3 bucks was a good price
[2023-10-26T01:38:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: Nkom best place to buy
[2023-10-26T01:38:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Even cheaper than china
[2023-10-26T01:40:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: Supplier of supplier will always go very high MOQ
[2023-10-26T01:40:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Like 100.000 pcs minimum
[2023-10-26T01:46:20] haku: Do you guys know wich crimper head will work on jst2.0? I havent done one before only jst2.5.

[2023-10-26T08:12:42] rosheee: And u feel the difference in ur pocket
[2023-10-26T09:04:47] heimdler: took it to another shop and saw the nuts they need to loosen and the problem is now gone. it can steer smoothly now. youve saved the day, thank you @jamessoderstrom !
[2023-10-26T09:59:20] Gabe Enzo: Lol I saw like 2 5yos on a scooter
[2023-10-26T09:59:23] Gabe Enzo: alone in the city
[2023-10-26T09:59:27] Gabe Enzo: wtf
[2023-10-26T10:13:40] heimdler: im so tempted to teach my 5yo son ride the splach ranger (vsett 8 clone), im thinking about offering 50% from original price to take it up. the handle can be lowered down and set to lowest mode. of course he will be constantly riding under my supervision for at least a year and fully protected
[2023-10-26T10:14:11] heimdler: also i want the splach turbo for myself, and let my wife takeover my existing 1S lol....
[2023-10-26T10:14:56] heimdler: i really love how the handle could just be folded, such a pain in the a$$ everytime i put my 1S into the trunk
[2023-10-26T10:14:59] Gabe Enzo: This'll turn into a martial art in the next year's
[2023-10-26T10:15:04] Gabe Enzo: haha
[2023-10-26T10:15:43] Gabe Enzo: when it happened to my RC esc it died
[2023-10-26T10:15:45] Gabe Enzo: lmfao
[2023-10-26T10:15:47] heimdler: but now my pet peeve is the small wheel base. front 8.5" pneumatic and 8" solid rear
[2023-10-26T10:15:57] Gabe Enzo: fix it
[2023-10-26T10:16:04] heimdler: how big can it go?
[2023-10-26T10:16:19] Gabe Enzo: on what
[2023-10-26T10:16:22] Gabe Enzo: the Xiaomi?
[2023-10-26T10:16:40] heimdler: the splach turbo/ranger

[2023-10-26T10:17:11] heimdler: <photos/photo_10524@26-10-2023_10-17-11.jpg>

[2023-10-26T10:17:45] heimdler: <photos/photo_10526@26-10-2023_10-17-45.jpg>
[2023-10-26T10:17:56] Gabe Enzo: why do you have a solid
[2023-10-26T10:17:58] heimdler: doesnt look like there's much space to fit in larger tire
[2023-10-26T10:18:07] heimdler: came stock like that
[2023-10-26T10:18:19] Gabe Enzo: ee
[2023-10-26T10:18:20] heimdler: solid is 8", front pneumatic is 8.5"
[2023-10-26T10:18:31] heimdler: front and rear drum brakes
[2023-10-26T10:20:53] heimdler: an the other thing is it weights a lot.... at 20.5kg
[2023-10-26T10:21:08] heimdler: even my xiaomi with front and rear monorim suspension max weight at 17.2kg
[2023-10-26T10:21:30] heimdler: damn this thing is solid
[2023-10-26T10:22:48] heimdler: how much does a second hand vsett 8 cost? got link anywhere?
[2023-10-26T10:58:43] Gabe Enzo: Anyone still have an idea why my ubox isn't turning on?
[2023-10-26T10:59:02] Gabe Enzo: wym
[2023-10-26T10:59:05] Mirono escooters: Magic is the easiest answer at this point
[2023-10-26T10:59:15] Mirono escooters: That it should be battery voltage
[2023-10-26T10:59:36] Gabe Enzo: the battery shows full charge on my multimeter lol
[2023-10-26T10:59:43] Gabe Enzo: maybe the multimeter is broken
[2023-10-26T10:59:48] Mirono escooters: And when connected,?
[2023-10-26T10:59:49] Gabe Enzo: also the ignition doesn't work either
[2023-10-26T11:00:00] Mirono escooters: I think your battery goes into protection
[2023-10-26T11:00:00] Gabe Enzo: As you know
[2023-10-26T11:00:04] Gabe Enzo: But why
[2023-10-26T11:00:06] Mirono escooters: It's time for you to buy a psu
[2023-10-26T11:00:10] Mirono escooters: Magic

[2023-10-26T11:00:22] Mirono escooters: Rofl
[2023-10-26T11:00:34] Gabe Enzo: One is shunted and the other battery is a 10s battery bms
[2023-10-26T11:00:45] Mirono escooters: Still magic
[2023-10-26T11:00:55] Gabe Enzo: Ohh
[2023-10-26T11:01:24] Gabe Enzo: Well I can use a supply
[2023-10-26T11:01:53] Gabe Enzo: Just find a 50v wall

[2023-10-26T11:03:21] Gabe Enzo: smh
[2023-10-26T11:03:43] Gabe Enzo: I can try turn it on with 10s
[2023-10-26T11:03:53] Gabe Enzo: one of the bms is going into protection
[2023-10-26T11:03:55] Gabe Enzo: probably
[2023-10-26T11:06:07] Mirono escooters: This'll be a loong day
[2023-10-26T11:06:15] Mirono escooters: Why not, idk, measure?
[2023-10-26T11:06:22] Mirono escooters: Instead of guessing and spamming üòÇ
[2023-10-26T11:35:30] haku: Is vsett 9+ is a generation above zero9? What about vsett 8 what is the equivalent?
[2023-10-26T11:38:07] haku: Is this zero 9 frame?
[2023-10-26T11:39:21] puneDir: Where to buy
[2023-10-26T11:40:04] haku: Aliexpress. Do you know what this frame is.
[2023-10-26T11:42:48] puneDir: Zero 10
[2023-10-26T11:42:50] puneDir: Can u send link
[2023-10-26T11:43:16] haku: And what is zero 9?
[2023-10-26T11:45:25] haku: I see. Makes sense. Thanks. But they use similar motors right?
[2023-10-26T11:45:48] haku: Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! $539.78 1%OFF | Good Quality 10Inch C-Type Suspension Electric Scooter Body Aluminum Frame Open Size 135Mm E-Scooter Accessories Spare Parts https://a.aliexpress.com/_mNbK0jW
[2023-10-26T11:47:58] haku: I see. Vsett has a great build quality. But the vsett 9+ comes with 8.5 tires and mechanical brakes in 2023 models.
[2023-10-26T11:48:51] haku: Nice and light though
[2023-10-26T11:56:47] Mirono escooters: Zero 10x frame üëé
[2023-10-26T11:57:46] haku: Whats wrong with it? Too many problems.
[2023-10-26T11:59:40] Pablo Fernandez: i heard it has weak spots in the stem for example
[2023-10-26T12:00:51] Pablo Fernandez: in one of those spots dont remember but the guy i sold my vsett 10 to, got his 10x snapped there
[2023-10-26T12:00:51] Mirono escooters: Smol batt space Shitty frame
[2023-10-26T12:00:59] puneDir: elshans zero stem snapped
[2023-10-26T12:01:17] puneDir: actually snaps from cable hole
[2023-10-26T12:01:43] Pablo Fernandez: i see i see, he just told me his stem snapped so no idea the exact spot
[2023-10-26T12:03:29] haku: Thanks for the info. It looks like a good platfrom to diy. Im sure its stronger than laotie ti30 frame
[2023-10-26T12:06:39] puneDir: Zero needs extender to put vertical battery
[2023-10-26T12:11:01] haku: I wish i can get a vsett 10 or 11 frame. I would migrate all my parts to. The telescoping stem of laotie scares me.
[2023-10-26T12:11:30] haku: If i will male it fast.
[2023-10-26T12:19:31] cihan: Can vsett 10 plus motor handle power over its rated power well?
[2023-10-26T12:19:48] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-10-26T12:20:40] cihan: There's one being sold almost like new and I'm waiting for a good price drop, does it have a durable stem for long term?
[2023-10-26T12:23:42] puneDir: Its impossible to find
[2023-10-26T12:24:33] cihan: Probably, but I have hopes.)

[2023-10-26T12:50:34] puneDir: Do you know when will it release
[2023-10-26T13:54:28] Happy Giraffe: Those I would get rid of, disc is so much strongerüòÖ
[2023-10-26T13:56:50] Mirono escooters: Nooooo Rages in blind love for drum brakes
[2023-10-26T14:20:47] heimdler: Gotta need to do research on where I can get those changed...
[2023-10-26T14:21:52] heimdler: Is there a vsett telegram group?
[2023-10-26T14:31:29] Mirono escooters: Replacing drum with disk is a big challenge, requires a lot of mods
[2023-10-26T14:31:43] Mirono escooters: If you stop fine with it + ebrake I wouldn't bother
[2023-10-26T14:40:05] Happy Giraffe: New rims and somehow need to make mount for caliper in frame. Other than that I would honestly get a better frame
[2023-10-26T14:40:33] Happy Giraffe: In a tuned scooter drum brake is a death wish
[2023-10-26T14:40:38] Mirono escooters: I wouldn't bother
[2023-10-26T14:40:48] Mirono escooters: Blabla
[2023-10-26T14:41:11] Happy Giraffe: Lol, see you at an emergency stop with drumsüòÇ
[2023-10-26T14:41:18] Mirono escooters: Sure
[2023-10-26T14:41:38] Mirono escooters: Puch with only front drumüòé (I'm too lazy to fix ebrake and I'm not modding a rare frame with disk)
[2023-10-26T14:41:42] Happy Giraffe: Person with disc has stopped and drum guy in hospital fighting for his life
[2023-10-26T14:42:14] Happy Giraffe: Yeah but now Im talking tuned scootüòÅ
[2023-10-26T14:42:34] Mirono escooters: Ye sure, my dual drum g30
[2023-10-26T14:42:35] Happy Giraffe: Puch not even meant for fast riding
[2023-10-26T14:42:39] Mirono escooters: Give me a month or so
[2023-10-26T14:42:48] Happy Giraffe: Pls no
[2023-10-26T14:42:53] Mirono escooters: Ebrake and dual drum
[2023-10-26T14:43:03] Mirono escooters: Br√∂der, if it stops me fine, and I even slip with drum, what's the point of hating
[2023-10-26T14:43:09] Mirono escooters: I'm not in the mood to argue about drum again
[2023-10-26T14:43:25] Mirono escooters: I spend months building it, I'm not gonna get lectured about it
[2023-10-26T14:43:48] Happy Giraffe: You weight 50kg, if a person has 50+kg on top of that the energy of moving mass is insanely more. Braking distance could easily be double
[2023-10-26T14:44:15] Mirono escooters: I'm telling my opinion, from my view
[2023-10-26T14:44:21] Mirono escooters: Not my issue when someone likes MacDonalds
[2023-10-26T14:44:33] Happy Giraffe: Lol
[2023-10-26T14:46:33] Mirono escooters: Ebrake does 80% of my braking too
[2023-10-26T14:56:53] heimdler: Comparatively disc stops better than drum. If the trouble to find parts to change to drum then I'm not gonna upgrade the performance of this clone vsett, rather do it on a Xiaomi where the parts are readily available
[2023-10-26T14:57:12] Mirono escooters: I doubt it's easily doable, considering the mounting differences
[2023-10-26T14:57:15] Mirono escooters: Better Upgrading to new scoot :)
[2023-10-26T14:57:18] heimdler: Yeah exactly
[2023-10-26T14:57:26] heimdler: As is, it's pretty slick tho
[2023-10-26T14:57:52] heimdler: Full suspension, dual brake and max speed at 45kph, wide platform and switchable handle height and foldable handlebars are a killer
[2023-10-26T14:59:36] heimdler: Xiaomi 1S are too low for me, platform kinda slim, but I've yet to push the splach and see how it performs at higher speed. I'm currently pretty comfy pushing the Xiaomi to 41kph and bunny hopping over road bumps lol
[2023-10-26T15:00:50] heimdler: Only thing I need to add on the splach now is clearer turn signals. The two blip at the bottom front and back are for ants to see, not safe to signal cars on the road
[2023-10-26T15:02:00] Mirono escooters: Foldable handlebars r cool
[2023-10-26T15:02:05] Mirono escooters: As long as they don't snap xd

[2023-10-26T15:16:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Is there a full video? Still asking üòÅ
[2023-10-26T15:26:42] Nick: Qs8 might be too much for my soldering iron
[2023-10-26T15:26:52] Mirono escooters: Takes a lot of heat
[2023-10-26T15:27:09] Nick: If this is the best I can do will it take 90a because it's solid but I'm worried about hotspots or something
[2023-10-26T15:27:29] Mirono escooters: Go xt90 then Or bullet connectors
[2023-10-26T15:27:29] Nick: <photos/photo_10531@26-10-2023_15-27-29.jpg>
[2023-10-26T15:27:33] Mirono escooters: Oh oh
[2023-10-26T15:28:03] Nick: It's making contact but idk if shitty solders will make hot spots or if it matters more that it just stays connected
[2023-10-26T15:28:15] Mirono escooters: It doesn't look super, tbh
[2023-10-26T15:28:16] Nick: It's got decent contact from wire to connector but the solder just looks ass
[2023-10-26T15:28:23] Mirono escooters: Cold joints
[2023-10-26T15:29:13] Nick: This side of the connector will be in a fixed position so if I'm not abusing it, it shouldn't be an issue or should I re do it?
[2023-10-26T15:29:29] Mirono escooters: ü§∑ your choice
[2023-10-26T15:29:33] Mirono escooters: If your iron can't do more
[2023-10-26T15:30:23] Nick: Its maxed out so I'm hoping this works. 90 is peak power it'll push for now
[2023-10-26T15:30:49] Nick: I just don't know if it can cause little micro shorts from the solder material or if that's not a thing
[2023-10-26T15:30:57] Nick: Like from being bumpy
[2023-10-26T15:31:55] Mirono escooters: Solder balls? Yeah
[2023-10-26T15:32:01] Mirono escooters: But they'd evaporate, lol
[2023-10-26T15:32:09] Mirono escooters: Shrinkwrqp it
[2023-10-26T15:35:00] Nick: <photos/photo_10532@26-10-2023_15-35-00.jpg>
[2023-10-26T15:35:34] Nick: I'm gonna do a round of electrical tape so I don't lifen't when I plug it into the battery as well
[2023-10-26T15:52:59] Happy Giraffe: Buy real vsett, clones are always a safety risk as you never know the metal quality etc. frame might snap in half
[2023-10-26T15:53:57] Happy Giraffe: If you soak iron tip on solder and then keep warming up wire with wet tip it will eventually heat it up
[2023-10-26T15:55:11] Mirono escooters: Eventually
[2023-10-26T15:55:20] Mirono escooters: Meanwhile toasting everything xd
[2023-10-26T15:58:21] heimdler: Splach seems pretty good. But max speed is just 35kph and 45kph. They come from the same factory in china as vsett anyway
[2023-10-26T16:02:18] Face de Pin Suc√©: A full video ?
[2023-10-26T16:02:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Full video of that race
[2023-10-26T16:03:19] Happy Giraffe: 60w iron should be enough. I dont know how people struggle to heat them up
[2023-10-26T16:14:51] Nick: For Spintend adcv2, I think I'm missing the connector that connects ADC to the main ESC or is it the one that just isn't completed?
[2023-10-26T16:15:10] Nick: <photos/photo_10533@26-10-2023_16-15-10.jpg>
[2023-10-26T16:15:33] Nick: ADC to Bluetooth, but I don't have the connector for this
[2023-10-26T16:15:49] Nick: <photos/photo_10534@26-10-2023_16-15-49.jpg>
[2023-10-26T16:16:25] Nick: <photos/photo_10535@26-10-2023_16-16-25.jpg>
[2023-10-26T16:16:37] Nick: I just had this one but it goes to nothing
[2023-10-26T16:18:37] Nick: <photos/photo_10536@26-10-2023_16-18-37.jpg>
[2023-10-26T16:20:24] Nick: Does it connect to ESC 1? I can complete the other end JST but idk what goes where
[2023-10-26T16:48:51] Happy Giraffe: There's dedicated bt port NFR
[2023-10-26T16:49:37] Nick: What is nfr?
[2023-10-26T16:51:39] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_10537@26-10-2023_16-51-39.jpg>
[2023-10-26T16:51:41] Nick: Nvm found it I'm guessing that's the nrf
[2023-10-26T16:51:46] Happy Giraffe: Port where you plug bt module
[2023-10-26T16:52:06] Happy Giraffe: Then you don't have to mess with adc
[2023-10-26T16:52:29] Nick: I do need the ADC though
[2023-10-26T16:52:38] Nick: For turn signals
[2023-10-26T16:54:51] Nick: I don't have the cable for that either
[2023-10-26T16:59:41] Nick: I'd just make the connector myself but my sausage fingers are too big to deal with JST ph
[2023-10-26T16:59:52] Nick: So I think I have to buy a whole set of cables
[2023-10-26T17:28:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: I have full rush, I will deliver later :)
[2023-10-26T17:30:06] rosheee: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr5TAK-Fnj8 so funny

[2023-10-26T17:40:54] Zak: Dont use it like that. Either get a big amount of flux on it and solder your tip first then put the tip onto the wires or just send the whole thing to someone else to do it for you
[2023-10-26T17:41:18] Zak: And use a big tip
[2023-10-26T17:49:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: üò≥

[2023-10-26T18:41:37] KierreKikkeli: adc comes with these
[2023-10-26T18:41:56] KierreKikkeli: i had to add connect the 2 pin and 3 pin to mine for it to work properly
[2023-10-26T18:43:05] KierreKikkeli: 8 pin cable goes to multifunction cable
[2023-10-26T18:43:32] KierreKikkeli: fan port extension cable goes to 12v cables for the adc

[2023-10-26T19:02:34] Gabe Enzo: 600‚Ç¨ for that
[2023-10-26T19:03:20] Gabe Enzo: I'll do it your way with the metal block
[2023-10-26T19:07:10] KierreKikkeli: xd
[2023-10-26T19:09:38] KierreKikkeli: cant out jank the poor master of diy jank
[2023-10-26T19:09:57] Mirono escooters: Hahahaha
[2023-10-26T19:10:00] Mirono escooters: Thermalglue ü§´
[2023-10-26T19:10:25] KierreKikkeli: expensive
[2023-10-26T19:10:43] KierreKikkeli: my solution costed 0,25‚Ç¨ and is removable without a headache
[2023-10-26T19:11:06] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-10-26T19:11:09] Mirono escooters: That is tru
[2023-10-26T19:11:33] KierreKikkeli: simple thermal paste here atleast cost like 10‚Ç¨ a small tube
[2023-10-26T19:11:59] Mirono escooters: Skill issue
[2023-10-26T19:12:20] KierreKikkeli: im fairly certain my solution is the opposite of that xd
[2023-10-26T19:14:01] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-10-26T19:20:02] Happy Giraffe: Why not metal bottom plate and bolt to that?üòÅ
[2023-10-26T19:20:50] Happy Giraffe: Then easy access for maintenance and never need to uninstall from thermal paste
[2023-10-26T19:20:52] KierreKikkeli: you literally told me to not do that coz heat conductivity???
[2023-10-26T19:21:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Would be to easy
[2023-10-26T19:23:13] Happy Giraffe: Why mispresent my words?üòí
[2023-10-26T19:23:38] Happy Giraffe: Literally said its good as metal bottom plate is in direct contact with air
[2023-10-26T19:24:02] Happy Giraffe: Exactly, they only cost like 10-20‚Ç¨ aswell
[2023-10-26T19:25:10] KierreKikkeli: wut, i remember you telling me its a bad idea to use those brackets as mounting plates which is why i went the other way around
[2023-10-26T19:25:24] Gabe Enzo: Because then we are back to square 1
[2023-10-26T19:26:05] Gabe Enzo: Also I'm doing this at the front not back, so I don't have that much room.
[2023-10-26T19:26:17] Happy Giraffe: They sell ready made metal bottom plates
[2023-10-26T19:26:21] Happy Giraffe: ...
[2023-10-26T19:26:32] Gabe Enzo: didn't know they existed.
[2023-10-26T19:26:33] KierreKikkeli: this is optimal
[2023-10-26T19:26:37] Gabe Enzo: zya
[2023-10-26T19:26:46] KierreKikkeli: my solution is for the poor
[2023-10-26T19:26:47] KierreKikkeli: xd
[2023-10-26T19:26:49] Gabe Enzo: I have no angle grinder lmso
[2023-10-26T19:26:51] Gabe Enzo: same
[2023-10-26T19:26:55] Gabe Enzo: ima Bend the metal
[2023-10-26T19:27:05] Gabe Enzo: till it snaps
[2023-10-26T19:27:24] KierreKikkeli: metal saw? cost like 5‚Ç¨ from a dollar store
[2023-10-26T19:27:42] Mirono escooters: Bite it off
[2023-10-26T19:27:48] Mirono escooters: Oh god
[2023-10-26T19:27:50] Gabe Enzo: wait. I have a metal saw
[2023-10-26T19:27:51] Gabe Enzo: electric
[2023-10-26T19:27:53] Gabe Enzo: I forgot.
[2023-10-26T19:28:07] KierreKikkeli: knew it xd
[2023-10-26T19:28:09] Gabe Enzo: Like the machine ones
[2023-10-26T19:28:09] Mirono escooters: Its not because you are born with 10 fingers, you have to die with 10 fingers
[2023-10-26T19:28:13] Gabe Enzo: not the angle grinder
[2023-10-26T19:28:19] Gabe Enzo: Lo ol
[2023-10-26T19:28:36] KierreKikkeli: ye
[2023-10-26T19:30:00] Happy Giraffe: https://www.techpunt.nl/en/bottom-cover-board-stainless-steel-for-xiaomi-m365.html
[2023-10-26T19:30:14] Gabe Enzo: not what I'm looking for
[2023-10-26T19:30:17] Happy Giraffe: 15‚Ç¨, its stainless so conducts heat worse
[2023-10-26T19:30:20] KierreKikkeli: who needs fingers
[2023-10-26T19:30:24] Happy Giraffe: But alu also sold
[2023-10-26T19:30:26] Gabe Enzo: also shit conductivity
[2023-10-26T19:30:31] Mirono escooters: Still enough
[2023-10-26T19:30:36] Happy Giraffe: Yep
[2023-10-26T19:30:46] Mirono escooters: You don't need much cooling Just, enough. Something
[2023-10-26T19:30:51] Mirono escooters: Scooter frame Is plenty too
[2023-10-26T19:31:06] Mirono escooters: Good thing ya ain't running current through it?
[2023-10-26T19:31:18] Happy Giraffe: Just showed its easy to find, googling xiaomi m365 metal plateüòÇ
[2023-10-26T19:31:23] Gabe Enzo: I mean mass conductivity
[2023-10-26T19:31:25] Gabe Enzo: like
[2023-10-26T19:31:31] Gabe Enzo: it can't hold much heat energy
[2023-10-26T19:31:39] Gabe Enzo: It's a thin piece
[2023-10-26T19:31:55] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-10-26T19:32:15] Happy Giraffe: Physics lessons in middle school want you back
[2023-10-26T19:33:04] Gabe Enzo: It can't tho lol. Not even the wind has direct contact with it.
[2023-10-26T19:33:06] Gabe Enzo: Wym
[2023-10-26T19:33:46] Mirono escooters: Hahahahahaha
[2023-10-26T19:33:59] Mirono escooters: Soo, when you riding, and bottom plate is at bottom, there's not wind on it?
[2023-10-26T19:34:04] Mirono escooters: Interesting, quantum physics?
[2023-10-26T19:34:36] Gabe Enzo: so escs need fuck all cooling.
[2023-10-26T19:34:38] Gabe Enzo: Got it
[2023-10-26T19:35:01] Gabe Enzo: I assumed that would be negligible compared to the entire frames wind intake.
[2023-10-26T19:35:25] Mirono escooters: It's, alot
[2023-10-26T19:35:33] Mirono escooters: Both cooling methods are perfectly fine
[2023-10-26T19:37:10] KierreKikkeli: you could always use a fan
[2023-10-26T19:37:21] KierreKikkeli: <animation>
[2023-10-26T19:37:29] Mirono escooters: NOOOOOOO
[2023-10-26T19:37:33] Mirono escooters: ban
[2023-10-26T19:37:40] KierreKikkeli: <animation>
[2023-10-26T19:39:56] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2023-10-26T19:39:59] Gabe Enzo: works with 10s. Heh
[2023-10-26T19:40:07] Gabe Enzo: happy days
[2023-10-26T19:40:17] Gabe Enzo: Age old proposition
[2023-10-26T19:40:29] Mirono escooters: So the hour long chatting of yesterday could've been avoided by listening to me
[2023-10-26T19:40:30] Mirono escooters: Moh
[2023-10-26T19:40:34] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-10-26T19:40:42] Gabe Enzo: The rant where you told me it was the battery?
[2023-10-26T19:40:46] Mirono escooters: Ya
[2023-10-26T19:41:02] Gabe Enzo: Yes, I took it into consideration the second you proposed it
[2023-10-26T19:41:20] Mirono escooters: So many variables Always filter out
[2023-10-26T19:41:22] Mirono escooters: It's barely the esc
[2023-10-26T19:41:30] Gabe Enzo: tiem to take this battery apart
[2023-10-26T19:41:41] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2023-10-26T19:42:06] Finn: I guess he is trolling
[2023-10-26T19:42:23] Mirono escooters: Not really
[2023-10-26T19:42:29] Mirono escooters: Perfectly possible
[2023-10-26T19:42:44] Mirono escooters: Weird to just jank a private chat in here
[2023-10-26T19:42:52] Mirono escooters: With not much evidence
[2023-10-26T19:42:53] Finn: Yeh
[2023-10-26T19:43:27] Mirono escooters: (at least hide a name)
[2023-10-26T19:47:54] KierreKikkeli: on another topic, just realized i couls possibly fit a full sized internal battery on mine if i bought a battery cover extender and a metal plate. As in mount the electronics on the metal plate so theres room for the battery ü§î
[2023-10-26T19:48:00] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_10542@26-10-2023_19-48-00.jpg>
[2023-10-26T19:48:08] Gabe Enzo: of course
[2023-10-26T19:48:09] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_10543@26-10-2023_19-48-09.jpg>
[2023-10-26T19:48:54] KierreKikkeli: prob doable just on my scoot as the height of it is modified
[2023-10-26T19:48:58] Gabe Enzo: my spacer is 32mm and my bottom cover kinda is pillowed up.
[2023-10-26T19:49:05] Gabe Enzo: so I may not be able to use that
[2023-10-26T19:49:32] Gabe Enzo: Ya
[2023-10-26T19:49:33] KierreKikkeli: yeah, also i have plenty of extra room between the ground and batt cover
[2023-10-26T19:49:34] Gabe Enzo: no sense right
[2023-10-26T19:49:47] Gabe Enzo: ?
[2023-10-26T19:50:04] Gabe Enzo: the bms does
[2023-10-26T19:50:15] Gabe Enzo: this battery worked before I blew the charging port.
[2023-10-26T19:50:44] Gabe Enzo: the bms was 13¬£
[2023-10-26T19:51:08] Gabe Enzo: What one should I get lmfao
[2023-10-26T19:51:12] Gabe Enzo: I thought that one would work
[2023-10-26T19:51:18] Mirono escooters: It should work
[2023-10-26T19:51:28] KierreKikkeli: happy bms op
[2023-10-26T19:51:36] Mirono escooters: But skill issue exist
[2023-10-26T19:51:41] Mirono escooters: Anyway smart BMS or shitty bms
[2023-10-26T19:52:14] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_10544@26-10-2023_19-52-14.jpg>
[2023-10-26T19:52:41] Gabe Enzo: might have wired it up wrong
[2023-10-26T19:53:14] Mirono escooters: I'm sure about that
[2023-10-26T19:53:17] Mirono escooters: Those BMSes just work fine
[2023-10-26T19:53:25] Mirono escooters: Nothing special, just work
[2023-10-26T19:53:37] Mirono escooters: Wire, multimeter on pins Then connect
[2023-10-26T19:53:43] Mirono escooters: It happens, so many wires. I understand
[2023-10-26T19:53:59] Mirono escooters: But so much blabla for so simple üò£ multimeter 2 min job to test
[2023-10-26T19:56:21] Gabe Enzo: Lol what, the Xiaomi bms is the one that isn't working
[2023-10-26T19:56:25] Gabe Enzo: this is unheard of xd
[2023-10-26T19:56:32] Gabe Enzo: Ha
[2023-10-26T19:56:56] Mirono escooters: üòë
[2023-10-26T19:58:46] Gabe Enzo: remember when I shorted the charging port
[2023-10-26T19:58:51] Gabe Enzo: I thought one batt died
[2023-10-26T19:58:55] Gabe Enzo: until now
[2023-10-26T19:59:09] Mirono escooters: Not surprised
[2023-10-26T19:59:19] Mirono escooters: Do it properly or just not at all
[2023-10-26T19:59:23] Mirono escooters: Or at least not here
[2023-10-26T19:59:25] Gabe Enzo: Yes.

[2023-10-26T21:03:25] KierreKikkeli: yayy, finally something thats not so scuffed as an idea xd
[2023-10-26T21:04:27] Mirono escooters: Dyson engineer well
[2023-10-26T21:05:16] KierreKikkeli: yea, i mainly need range atm tho xd, when i have the monies ill prob order something like a 14-16s from you
[2023-10-26T21:06:13] Gabe Enzo: more wh
[2023-10-26T21:06:23] KierreKikkeli: yup, a 13s would be needed to reach 45-50kmh, but 10km range would be useless xd
[2023-10-26T21:06:47] KierreKikkeli: mine spins up to that too with a 20A 12s XD
[2023-10-26T21:06:58] KierreKikkeli: 40-47 on flat ground :c
[2023-10-26T21:07:11] Gabe Enzo: I get 75 with 20s 20a batt
[2023-10-26T21:07:40] KierreKikkeli: no field weakening and need to replace the bearings, and accelerating beyond 35kmh is slow and painful xd
[2023-10-26T21:09:19] KierreKikkeli: yea, a 60A 20K Mah 16s would be prob ideal but expensive af xd
[2023-10-26T21:11:39] KierreKikkeli: Ill still be broke af XD
[2023-10-26T21:12:08] KierreKikkeli: need to prob wait for the next years tax returns or start saving up when im allowed to generate income
[2023-10-26T21:16:58] KierreKikkeli: jail
[2023-10-26T21:17:02] Mirono escooters: Kuch Do they need to know you earned money Kuch
[2023-10-26T21:18:24] KierreKikkeli: tldr; few govt hags have it out for me for unknown reasons and caused a never before seen shit storm bcoz i was earning 100-200‚Ç¨/month with video editing side hustle while also being on the govt pensions coz disabilities
[2023-10-26T21:18:51] KierreKikkeli: so im not allowed to generate external income at all for a year
[2023-10-26T21:19:05] KierreKikkeli: or they will again cut all my pensions and leave me starving
[2023-10-26T21:19:45] Pablo Fernandez: Cant get paid in crypto?
[2023-10-26T21:19:47] Mirono escooters: Those 2 things aren't smart to combineüòÇ
[2023-10-26T21:19:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: No bro, isn‚Äôt like that ahhaha
[2023-10-26T21:20:12] Pablo Fernandez: I got a business with a phone Game and i take all the payments in crypto. Up to 9k a month no issues
[2023-10-26T21:20:22] KierreKikkeli: i have the hags addresses, names, family member hobbies and all other kinds of background info incase they want to stir up another shitstorm üëç
[2023-10-26T21:20:51] KierreKikkeli: its allowed up to 300 or 500‚Ç¨/month by their own rules
[2023-10-26T21:21:01] Mirono escooters: You were going over dat
[2023-10-26T21:21:01] KierreKikkeli: im just an exception bcoz they can
[2023-10-26T21:21:05] KierreKikkeli: nope
[2023-10-26T21:21:09] Mirono escooters: Or you mean per month
[2023-10-26T21:21:16] KierreKikkeli: yea
[2023-10-26T21:21:37] Mirono escooters: Average discord admin No really, fight the law if you think you right Or admit you didn't see it?
[2023-10-26T21:21:51] Mirono escooters: Doubt they make ppl exceptions
[2023-10-26T21:21:56] KierreKikkeli: cant fight the govt bodies :))))
[2023-10-26T21:22:10] KierreKikkeli: apparently they can, hence the "never before seen shitstorm"'
[2023-10-26T21:22:13] Mirono escooters: Sure can but not the group for it Let's Leave it
[2023-10-26T21:22:30] KierreKikkeli: pulled the whole towns govt workers into the mess
[2023-10-26T21:22:37] KierreKikkeli: or city i guess
[2023-10-26T21:23:05] KierreKikkeli: and everyone was just baffled at wtf is going on while the bodies that issued the penalties and others also knew nothing
[2023-10-26T21:25:07] KierreKikkeli: and coz finland, even tho it goes against their own reasons and rules, you cant make em face any consequences, the body nor the workers themselfs, once something is set on motion it will go through no questions asked until at the point you need to pay em fines which got rebunked
[2023-10-26T21:26:59] Mirono escooters: Ssht, vesc
[2023-10-26T21:28:21] KierreKikkeli: tldr im broke and cant afford batteries or other expensive stuff xd
[2023-10-26T21:29:16] Mirono escooters: Understood
[2023-10-26T21:29:17] Mirono escooters: :)
[2023-10-26T23:52:59] haku: What scooters are those and why do they keep wiping out. Never seen this before.
[2023-10-26T23:56:03] Jan: ESkootr League
[2023-10-26T23:57:19] Pablo Fernandez: taking the nami out of the car depot after the accident: from 400 to 1500 euros. i love spain
[2023-10-27T00:00:19] haku: Pretty cool. What is the voltage for these scooters? And why do they have to start on a decline?
[2023-10-27T00:01:36] haku: Im about to go there and represent the US. Ala ricky bobby
[2023-10-27T00:06:47] Jan: I think the voltage is terribly low, i think even less than 60V
[2023-10-27T00:06:58] Jan: But still 12kW
[2023-10-27T00:07:09] Jan: Absolute sausage cable nightmare that thing
[2023-10-27T00:07:26] Jan: I made some pictures while i was in paris of the prototype

[2023-10-27T00:08:51] Jan: Its actually not carbon
[2023-10-27T00:08:59] haku: Oh.
[2023-10-27T00:09:03] Jan: Its another composite made out of basalt fiber
[2023-10-27T00:09:19] Jan: Its a sustainability topic
[2023-10-27T00:09:29] Pablo Fernandez: it looks like someone ran over a gift wrapping while riding
[2023-10-27T00:09:33] Jan: ^^
[2023-10-27T00:09:36] haku: Gotcha
[2023-10-27T00:10:44] haku: You guys get all the ev tech up there
[2023-10-27T00:11:01] Jan: I worked in composites
[2023-10-27T00:11:12] Jan: Had to attend this as part of my job
[2023-10-27T00:11:34] haku: Nice.
[2023-10-27T00:22:05] Paolo ‚Å≠: No, it‚Äôs carbon fiber
[2023-10-27T00:22:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_10549@27-10-2023_00-22-47.jpg>
[2023-10-27T00:27:23] Jan: Thats not carbon fiber on the outer shell
[2023-10-27T00:27:46] Jan: The aero body work is basalt 100%
[2023-10-27T00:28:51] Jan: <animation>
[2023-10-27T00:28:51] haku: Ive been watching thier other videos. My fatass wont be able to turn like that. Im sure there is a weight class.
[2023-10-27T00:29:01] Jan: Paolo on every sentence i write XD
[2023-10-27T00:29:53] Jan: Ah found it
[2023-10-27T00:29:56] Jan: <files/image (3).png>
[2023-10-27T00:30:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yeah bro that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm actually single
[2023-10-27T00:30:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: <sticker>
[2023-10-27T00:30:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: I scare girls
[2023-10-27T00:30:58] haku: Ivw never seen natural fiber before. Is it hemp?
[2023-10-27T00:31:39] Jan: Nah, just dont full direct counter attack when they might say something wrong ^^
[2023-10-27T00:32:22] Jan: Basalt is an anorganic fiber, i think it comes from some minerals with high silicondioxide content
[2023-10-27T00:32:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Nahhh people hate me because of that Xd
[2023-10-27T00:33:36] Jan: I think people usually dislike being corrected but if you say it the right way it easily slides in without offending
[2023-10-27T00:34:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt offended nobody :( I just like waste my time doing that, when I can üòÜ
[2023-10-27T00:35:08] Jan: Choose one, waste time or relationships XD
[2023-10-27T00:35:49] Jan: For me please always correct me, i might be wrong and i can learn something
[2023-10-27T00:35:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Depends üòÇ actually rest time in the gym
[2023-10-27T00:36:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: So I don‚Äôt have nothing to do
[2023-10-27T00:36:31] haku: I chose both. Thats why i just got divorced
[2023-10-27T00:37:00] Jan: Sometimes its better just to split if it doesnt work out
[2023-10-27T00:37:10] Jan: Time is quite the finite resource
[2023-10-27T00:37:23] Jan: No amount of money ever bought a second of time
[2023-10-27T00:37:31] Jan: -Howard Stark
[2023-10-27T00:37:46] haku: Oh well now i have the time to play with scooters and spend more time with my son
[2023-10-27T00:38:05] Jan: Time well spent is the time you enjoy
[2023-10-27T02:04:24] Happy Giraffe: Father son time the best one ever, so many good childhood memories doing different stuff together. Maybe even get him to scooters when old enoughüòâ
[2023-10-27T02:14:29] haku: Yea man. Even for me spending time with him is awsome
[2023-10-27T04:54:50] heimdler: Not gonna lie, the suspension is really ultra smooth... Just took it for 14km run, it was fun bunny hopping around the speed bumps lol...
[2023-10-27T04:55:19] heimdler: The wide base improves handling too, nice landing even though the rear is just a solid 8"
[2023-10-27T05:12:52] haku: Splach and vsett is made in the same factory right?
[2023-10-27T07:51:32] haku: Can this extinguish battery fires?
[2023-10-27T08:05:00] Happy Giraffe: If its co2 yes but 10kg li-ion battery on fire is hard to cool down. Thats too small for that I think. Better than nothing thoüòÅ
[2023-10-27T08:06:40] haku: I keep one in the garage and the room where i mess with scooters. What is the proper extinguisher for batteries?
[2023-10-27T08:08:16] Happy Giraffe: Co2 is the right one, but non-flammable area is bestüòÅ
[2023-10-27T08:08:57] Happy Giraffe: You never know what happens if flames burst and theres panic. Non flammable area especially when charging
[2023-10-27T08:09:17] haku: Dam i park my scooter next to my tesla. Kinda scary sometimes.
[2023-10-27T08:10:35] Happy Giraffe: I take out my battery from bike to charge at home. Will make steel base for it (with lid but some air gap) next week. So far so good
[2023-10-27T08:12:16] haku: Thats the move! I only charge during the day after i let my battery rest overnight.
[2023-10-27T08:13:22] Happy Giraffe: Charging when you are nearby is a good one. Lithium ions dont need a rest that much. Maybe 15 mins if you want to be extra gentle on them
[2023-10-27T08:14:31] haku: A good bms with a temp sensor is a must with these pevs.
[2023-10-27T08:14:42] Happy Giraffe: I wonder what kind of a bms tesla has compared to oursü§î
[2023-10-27T08:15:18] Happy Giraffe: Thats very true, I got a basic Daly cheap chinese but as long as it balances cells Im more than happy
[2023-10-27T08:15:37] haku: I have no idea. Never tried messing with it. Its pretty cool because the app tells you everything
[2023-10-27T08:16:54] Happy Giraffe: That's interesting, only more thing we want is cells at the price Tesla buys/builds them...üòÇ
[2023-10-27T08:17:41] haku: Agreed. Can get older tesla cells. 21700. Now they make it with the bigger cells
[2023-10-27T08:18:07] haku: I always keep it below 80%, to prolong it
[2023-10-27T08:18:26] haku: And charge at 30a
[2023-10-27T08:19:35] haku: But i only use this when i drive my son and get groceries. Most of the time im on my scooter lol
[2023-10-27T08:21:32] haku: I wish vesc have that feature charge to 80%
[2023-10-27T09:20:56] Happy Giraffe: Thats smart, enjoy 5x cell life
[2023-10-27T09:21:38] Happy Giraffe: Hard to implement, would need ac power to go into motor coils or something wildüòÖ
[2023-10-27T09:22:01] Happy Giraffe: You can buy Grin satiator if you have money, programmable tiny waterproof charger.
[2023-10-27T09:27:09] Oreo huzky: Put vesc in it
[2023-10-27T09:34:56] heimdler: I'm considering full face now, lucky I still haven't got into any crash or accident yet. It's a matter of when. Is this overkill?
[2023-10-27T09:35:35] heimdler: Not using for off road. Mostly for urban, meaning around housing area or city
[2023-10-27T09:44:51] Pablo Fernandez: Not overkill. If you fall without full face you Will Smash your chin in most cases
[2023-10-27T10:20:10] Gabe Enzo: Underkill.
[2023-10-27T10:20:12] Gabe Enzo: Sadly
[2023-10-27T10:20:28] Gabe Enzo: Get the ones that close up
[2023-10-27T10:20:30] Gabe Enzo: they're better
[2023-10-27T10:20:45] Gabe Enzo: those are for like dirtbiking the ones you showed
[2023-10-27T10:20:48] heimdler: There's low profile full face tho
[2023-10-27T10:20:58] heimdler: Ok will look it up
[2023-10-27T10:21:07] Gabe Enzo: Just motorbike helmet
[2023-10-27T10:21:08] Gabe Enzo: that's it
[2023-10-27T10:21:48] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2023-10-27T10:37:40] Pablo Fernandez: yeah i mean that having a full face is not overkill
[2023-10-27T10:45:07] heimdler: Yeah thanks for the safety tips
[2023-10-27T10:47:03] Mirono escooters: No, only grade D can
[2023-10-27T10:47:15] Mirono escooters: Dont expect to be able to stop a runaway battery
[2023-10-27T10:47:23] Mirono escooters: A big metal box filled with water is your only hope
[2023-10-27T11:27:38] NetworkDir: I think enduro type helmet better for scooter
[2023-10-27T11:28:03] NetworkDir: Better protection for chin and face
[2023-10-27T11:28:59] NetworkDir: LS2 FAST-BLK
[2023-10-27T11:29:11] NetworkDir: i want purchase this one
[2023-10-27T11:30:40] NetworkDir: This color very sexy but my scooter red :(
[2023-10-27T11:32:22] puneDir: How much
[2023-10-27T11:32:29] NetworkDir: 4k
[2023-10-27T11:38:15] Gabe Enzo: Wasps get into my face with that one.
[2023-10-27T11:38:19] Gabe Enzo: Can literally cause a crash
[2023-10-27T12:03:13] haku: Too pricey imo. Its quality stuff but can only do max 5a. I like that its variable though
[2023-10-27T12:10:29] NetworkDir: This helmet has special glasses
[2023-10-27T12:11:26] Gabe Enzo: They get trapped like around the outline of the glasses
[2023-10-27T12:11:28] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_10556@27-10-2023_12-11-28.jpg>
[2023-10-27T12:12:17] Gabe Enzo: Guys how do I wire the Xiaomi e brake and accelerator to vesc?
[2023-10-27T12:14:27] NetworkDir: Do you have a xiaomi display?
[2023-10-27T12:14:35] Gabe Enzo: That also I do have
[2023-10-27T12:14:37] Gabe Enzo: Ya
[2023-10-27T12:14:42] NetworkDir: https://github.com/m365fw/vesc_m365_dash/
[2023-10-27T12:22:14] Gabe Enzo: Not very clear on where to load the script etc
[2023-10-27T12:22:37] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2023-10-27T12:23:13] Mirono escooters: He does it for free Be happy he wrote a script and GitHub
[2023-10-27T12:23:20] Mirono escooters: It's literally paste in lisp vescüòÇ
[2023-10-27T12:26:38] Gabe Enzo: nvm I realized I have a German translator
[2023-10-27T12:26:54] Gabe Enzo: yeh
[2023-10-27T12:30:16] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-10-27T13:37:42] Pablo Fernandez: The nami is back home from the crash
[2023-10-27T13:38:10] Pablo Fernandez: 10 days in the rain ü´°
[2023-10-27T13:42:56] Pablo Fernandez: Havent checked, im out of escooters for a while. Will try later
[2023-10-27T13:44:44] Pablo Fernandez: Just did, doesnt turn on
[2023-10-27T13:44:56] Pablo Fernandez: But expected, since display is almost fucked Up
[2023-10-27T13:45:55] Mirono escooters: Shame
[2023-10-27T13:46:39] Pablo Fernandez: Also havent checked cables or anything so not too worried. I Will mostly sell It as pieces and trash It anyways
[2023-10-27T14:04:00] Pablo Fernandez: Nothing but im almost 100% sure i didnt lose control
[2023-10-27T14:05:27] Pablo Fernandez: Because both my nuckles got the brake lever Mark (as if they hit me while crashing)
[2023-10-27T14:06:03] Pablo Fernandez: <photos/photo_10558@27-10-2023_14-06-03.jpg>
[2023-10-27T14:06:17] Pablo Fernandez: So It looks like a front Crash somehow
[2023-10-27T14:11:45] Pablo Fernandez: Still dont explain how my whole back is burned but well, there It is lol
[2023-10-27T14:11:59] Gabe Enzo: did a car crash into you
[2023-10-27T14:12:00] Mirono escooters: :(
[2023-10-27T14:14:55] Pablo Fernandez: My main theory is a cat/rabbit ran into the wheel due to the area where It happened
[2023-10-27T14:15:12] Pablo Fernandez: Therefore not remembering anything because i just crashed and got unconcious
[2023-10-27T14:26:55] Gabe Enzo: u got memory loss haha
[2023-10-27T15:01:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well , Looking at the pics and this back burn I guess you felt off someway and managed to slide on your back with open hands
[2023-10-27T15:02:05] Pablo Fernandez: Maybe no idea
[2023-10-27T15:03:06] Pablo Fernandez: Also a 500 bucks fine because 1500w motors is ilegal in 2027 here in spain
[2023-10-27T15:04:00] Pablo Fernandez: So i have to waste my time now saying that the Guy was retarded to get back the money ü´•
[2023-10-27T15:04:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: The signs on your hand and the back situation ,i saw before Also i would ask you before next runs to buy more gear , some gloves and spine protector would also help
[2023-10-27T15:04:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Could be worse,still not good but could be
[2023-10-27T15:05:10] Pablo Fernandez: I am selling my escooters to be honest. Cant Risk more skull damage
[2023-10-27T15:05:21] Pablo Fernandez: Will get It back so no issues at all
[2023-10-27T15:05:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Not sure i understand what you mean here
[2023-10-27T15:05:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: As you wish
[2023-10-27T15:07:22] Pablo Fernandez: The law here in spain allows unlimited watts in motors until 2027 however if the officer had no idea and just looked in the law: "escooters" It only shows Up the requirements after 2027, Max 500watts.
[2023-10-27T15:07:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I see
[2023-10-27T15:11:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Meanwhile Tell you a story of a customer of mine , basically he didn't call for week or two and he should be picking up his scooter, so i hit the phone what's up , didn't pick up, but in some days called back Telling me that he managed to break his head and concussion I asked what happened He was at home puting some books on the shelf ,rest he didn't remember ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-10-27T15:12:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So there is x % chance always to fuck your self up in any situation
[2023-10-27T15:13:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: üòÖ do you think pigs who cant read, will understand words ü§£
[2023-10-27T15:13:56] Pablo Fernandez: Totally agree
[2023-10-27T15:20:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: That's true and i dont have any experience in this I mean last time i felt was 14 By my self
[2023-10-27T15:21:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: ButüòÖüòÖ actually once i was hit with a car ,i was with a moped and felt , moped was on me Car stopped
[2023-10-27T15:21:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Guess who hit me?
[2023-10-27T15:21:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Police
[2023-10-27T15:22:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I didn't stop for them and the only way was this to stop me ü§£
[2023-10-27T15:22:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So basically i would say fuck them allüòÖ
[2023-10-27T15:24:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Story facts No licence No papers for the moped No helmet No insurance And at the of the day they could not fine me coz they literly risked my life was like 16 at this point
[2023-10-27T15:36:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: ü§£ cant say i dont have a few handful of police or court stories of my ownüòÖ
[2023-10-27T15:37:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Telling one more coz , looking back at it was a revenge
[2023-10-27T15:37:42] Gabe Enzo: Not illegal if you can get away
[2023-10-27T15:37:59] Gabe Enzo: That's why they want you to have a slow motor
[2023-10-27T15:38:08] Gabe Enzo: <sticker>
[2023-10-27T15:39:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Year later or such we hit an out of service police officer on a pedestrian crossing and he sit on the car hood to rest a bit üòÖ
[2023-10-27T16:07:28] rosheee: FERROFLUID JUST BTW With Statorade, we start to see measurable improvements in heat dissipation with just 2-3 mL, and on most hub motors the full effect is reached with somewhere between 5-8 mL at modest RPMs, and 8-12mL for fast RPMs. If more Statorade is added beyond this, then there is almost no change in the heat flow but you will start getting increasing viscous fluid drag. In the graph below, you can see the effects of adding Statorade 1mL at a time on a large 40mm wide MXUS direct drive hub motor.
[2023-10-27T16:32:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Where is the graf Bro üòÖ
[2023-10-27T16:33:13] francois schempers: he forgot, but I know where he got the info, so here it is üòÇüòÇ
[2023-10-27T16:33:17] francois schempers: <photos/photo_10559@27-10-2023_16-33-17.jpg>
[2023-10-27T16:38:48] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I am familiar with ferrofluid and its stats ,just was curios
[2023-10-27T17:42:25] heimdler: Hey which scooter brand are most wanted in everyone's wish list for performance and suspension comfort? Is it a Nami, Vsett or a Kaboo?
[2023-10-27T17:47:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: This is a hard question, so far i would not say any is perfect more than far from it , coz of kids shoe problems,but probably would say Ninebot gt2
[2023-10-27T17:48:49] heimdler: Ninebot, Xiaomi and Segway would be categorized into mainstream brands, right? Below $1k range
[2023-10-27T17:49:34] heimdler: Nami, Vsett and Kaboo would be placed under performance category to be fair? Where price starts $1k above
[2023-10-27T17:49:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Once again gt2
[2023-10-27T17:50:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Shit bigger than any vsett
[2023-10-27T17:50:14] heimdler: Ok let me check it out
[2023-10-27T17:50:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Or kaboo or any other you mentioned
[2023-10-27T17:50:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Price is high also
[2023-10-27T17:51:24] heimdler: Hmm very sleek
[2023-10-27T17:51:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: <photos/photo_10560@27-10-2023_17-51-31.jpg>
[2023-10-27T17:51:42] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Gt2 near g30
[2023-10-27T17:51:51] heimdler: Yeah that's a monster
[2023-10-27T17:52:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Does 70ish km/h stock
[2023-10-27T17:52:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Interesting to try
[2023-10-27T17:52:57] heimdler: Wait it's too heavy.... 56.2kg wth...
[2023-10-27T17:53:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You have lot problems bro
[2023-10-27T17:53:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Big ass powerfull scooters Always heavy
[2023-10-27T17:53:39] heimdler: Haha
[2023-10-27T17:53:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Imagine how heavy is a weped
[2023-10-27T17:54:47] heimdler: There's a line I do not cross in terms of weight. Vsett 8 at 20kg is already considered heavy to be lifted with one hand
[2023-10-27T17:55:26] heimdler: A modded Xiaomi that can do 120kph weights below 20kg?
[2023-10-27T17:56:26] heimdler: I'd cut the weight max at 20kg and see if there's anything that can go faster with that
[2023-10-27T17:58:23] heimdler: Honestly speaking, despite the vsett 8 clone that I tried weights 20kg, with max speed of 40kph. My Xiaomi 1S did the same max speed at 17kg but of course built is not so solid as the vsett. There's something to be loved at modded scooters, they can go faster with less weight
[2023-10-27T17:59:52] heimdler: But thanks for the tips bro, weight will be something I need to ponder about to match with performance
[2023-10-27T18:03:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Not possible, Around 30 kg and still 90 while every possible space Outside also has battery
[2023-10-27T18:03:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But depends on if you dont need range
[2023-10-27T18:03:45] heimdler: dont need
[2023-10-27T18:04:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Than less battery is enough
[2023-10-27T18:04:04] heimdler: its just a speed machine
[2023-10-27T18:04:15] heimdler: distance per trip 1-3km
[2023-10-27T18:04:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But just the mentioned one has have front and rear monorim ,two atleast blade 1200 w and 16s vesc
[2023-10-27T18:05:31] heimdler: phew..
[2023-10-27T18:06:18] heimdler: but im using xiaomi for comparison in terms of weight to performance ratio, coz i have seen a xiaomi frame highest speed is 120kph from two different video
[2023-10-27T18:06:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yeah video so zero stats shared
[2023-10-27T18:06:59] heimdler: so modded xiaomi/ninebot in terms of weight to performance ratio, its undisputable
[2023-10-27T18:07:25] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Weped sonic actually is a 180kg
[2023-10-27T18:07:34] heimdler: high end scooters are shouting they have better performance but weights 20kg+
[2023-10-27T18:08:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I dont say its bad ,but above 60-70 km h , i would not say its a good idea
[2023-10-27T18:08:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Jeez
[2023-10-27T18:08:44] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: You need weight for going higher in speed
[2023-10-27T18:08:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yep
[2023-10-27T18:08:57] heimdler: agree, but its a benchmark you know what i mean, someone could be buying a machine that has max speed 80kph but truly they only do 50kph at most. and then next thing is to look at weight
[2023-10-27T18:09:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Since no weight you just spin tires without grip
[2023-10-27T18:09:53] heimdler: true, i guess best is to just look at something that goes up to 40-60kph because thats likely the speed most people will go with scooter
[2023-10-27T18:10:01] francois schempers: or you can have heavier driver and lighter scooter üòÇ
[2023-10-27T18:10:08] heimdler: lol...
[2023-10-27T18:10:25] rosheee: sry üòÜ
[2023-10-27T18:10:27] heimdler: but 40 without protection already feels like 80 haha
[2023-10-27T18:10:29] francois schempers: then max g2 üëå good suspensions, plenty of space for mods, affordable
[2023-10-27T18:10:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Np
[2023-10-27T18:10:43] rosheee: g30 + gt2
[2023-10-27T18:11:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I would vote for g30 instead of g2
[2023-10-27T18:11:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Shit has plenty problems
[2023-10-27T18:11:40] rosheee: performance fail need steeringdamper cuz wobble and yah u can't take in train üòÜ¬®
[2023-10-27T18:11:43] heimdler: what if you have the budget to buy 2x g30?
[2023-10-27T18:11:46] francois schempers: g30 with added suspension looks like a DIY thing, g2 looks stock, could save you in front of police
[2023-10-27T18:12:05] rosheee: will see when i plant on my face i just did like 50km ^^' then kicked all shit out not needed
[2023-10-27T18:12:16] heimdler: you truly got me there! yes cant take on train, absolute clumsy giant
[2023-10-27T18:12:24] rosheee: what if a custom g30 is around 4500-5500?
[2023-10-27T18:12:30] rosheee: and no need for steeringdamper
[2023-10-27T18:12:38] rosheee: but never grip on front when 20s
[2023-10-27T18:12:59] heimdler: no, what if you have budget to buy 2x of g30, what would you pick?
[2023-10-27T18:13:06] rosheee: g30 ^^'
[2023-10-27T18:13:09] rosheee: then custom
[2023-10-27T18:13:10] heimdler: haha
[2023-10-27T18:13:13] rosheee: no rly
[2023-10-27T18:13:16] rosheee: or gt2 then custom
[2023-10-27T18:13:41] heimdler: nooo... 56kg huge
[2023-10-27T18:13:45] rosheee: then g30
[2023-10-27T18:13:50] heimdler: oh wait... i guess there's no such thing
[2023-10-27T18:13:58] rosheee: 16s with or without spacer 25kg
[2023-10-27T18:14:08] heimdler: Kaboo Mantis 8 pro, thats also huge right?
[2023-10-27T18:14:11] rosheee: can go +100kmh and with g00d battery 10kw or more
[2023-10-27T18:14:14] francois schempers: buy a g30 frame, for much cheaper, then build your Vesc scooter inside it
[2023-10-27T18:14:18] rosheee: absolut
[2023-10-27T18:15:01] heimdler: wait, the kaboo mantis 8 pro is within 20kg, 26kg to be exact
[2023-10-27T18:15:05] francois schempers: g2 frame is steel though, not aluminium
[2023-10-27T18:15:18] rosheee: rly?
[2023-10-27T18:15:21] francois schempers: yep
[2023-10-27T18:15:22] heimdler: g30 no suspension
[2023-10-27T18:15:30] rosheee: rear? not needed at +100kmh
[2023-10-27T18:15:45] rosheee: and g30 u can get rear suspension
[2023-10-27T18:15:52] rosheee: but then limited on brake
[2023-10-27T18:16:05] francois schempers: if you want stockish looking suspension, go for g2, it's the next gen g30
[2023-10-27T18:16:10] heimdler: no more 100kph lol, was mentioning it because i saw someone pushed it to that
[2023-10-27T18:16:34] rosheee: no more 100?
[2023-10-27T18:16:38] rosheee: what u're lookin for then?
[2023-10-27T18:16:40] rosheee: offroad?
[2023-10-27T18:16:58] heimdler: Kaboo Mantis 8 pro is a good start
[2023-10-27T18:17:22] heimdler: has top speed of 55kph
[2023-10-27T18:17:26] rosheee: but then
[2023-10-27T18:17:28] rosheee: u wanna go faster
[2023-10-27T18:17:29] heimdler: also full suspension
[2023-10-27T18:17:29] rosheee: and better performance
[2023-10-27T18:17:31] rosheee: and this and that
[2023-10-27T18:17:34] rosheee: then $$$$$$$
[2023-10-27T18:17:50] heimdler: was saying that to point out its limit
[2023-10-27T18:17:55] rosheee: ok
[2023-10-27T18:18:03] rosheee: also depends on ur roads ^^
[2023-10-27T18:18:04] heimdler: lets start from here
[2023-10-27T18:18:08] rosheee: if crap roads then ^^'
[2023-10-27T18:18:12] rosheee: better not g30
[2023-10-27T18:18:38] francois schempers: Well if you're here, it's not for stock performance I presume ^^
[2023-10-27T18:18:44] heimdler: yes crap tar road, some pot holes here and there, road bumps, nonexistant pedestrian pathways
[2023-10-27T18:19:02] rosheee: or vsett 10+ maybe
[2023-10-27T18:19:11] heimdler: this one at stock max speed is 55kph tho
[2023-10-27T18:19:13] rosheee: know a lot who send it offroad
[2023-10-27T18:19:19] rosheee: with vesc u can limit then ^^
[2023-10-27T18:19:55] rosheee: idk ^^' but i not like whole quality of mantis ..a friend has it ...and it sounds crap ^^' and brakes crap...idk BUT yah '^^' pls no hate me
[2023-10-27T18:20:14] francois schempers: now with field weakening with minimal change most scooter that as cfw can do 40km/h no problem
[2023-10-27T18:20:33] rosheee: but when CFW ^^' with FW reinforce controller plugs n phase wires
[2023-10-27T18:20:33] heimdler: this costs more than the kaboo mantis 8 pro, also vsett 10 is next level performance
[2023-10-27T18:20:40] rosheee: üòÜfriends g30 fried cuz FW
[2023-10-27T18:21:06] rosheee: yah but better buy something more quality and maybe faster cuz if u're rly into scooters u want it anyway
[2023-10-27T18:21:11] francois schempers: Well you must know what your doing a minimum x) what was his settings?
[2023-10-27T18:21:12] rosheee: spend less money
[2023-10-27T18:21:18] rosheee: yah know i knoiw ^^'
[2023-10-27T18:21:19] rosheee: hmm
[2023-10-27T18:21:25] rosheee: I THINK HE CHANGED THE FW
[2023-10-27T18:21:26] rosheee: 100%
[2023-10-27T18:21:31] heimdler: haha yeah i did that on my xiaomi 1S already but suspension with monorim is bad tho
[2023-10-27T18:21:58] rosheee: so then u know it now buy mantis and then u like but want more then spend again $$$$ so better step a bit more up
[2023-10-27T18:22:03] rosheee: also vsett community big
[2023-10-27T18:22:15] rosheee: https://t.me/vsett_eu_us_ENGLISH_mods_hacks
[2023-10-27T18:22:22] heimdler: thanks, was looking for it
[2023-10-27T18:22:28] rosheee: i think i set 50A phase + 10A fw
[2023-10-27T18:22:37] francois schempers: let's take the bull by the horns, what's your total budget ?
[2023-10-27T18:23:02] heimdler: enough to afford a mantis 8 pro
[2023-10-27T18:23:17] heimdler: 1.5k usd
[2023-10-27T18:23:22] rosheee: just saying..cuz me bought 7 m365 pro ^^' cuz wasn't sure buying and spend more for a g30
[2023-10-27T18:23:22] rosheee: xD
[2023-10-27T18:23:33] francois schempers: what ? why 50A phase ? more than 32 is practically useless and dump heat in the motor x) I'm at 30A phase and 20A fw
[2023-10-27T18:23:40] rosheee: nono ^^
[2023-10-27T18:23:46] rosheee: did +55kmh gps
[2023-10-27T18:23:55] rosheee: and uphill with 100kg also hood performance
[2023-10-27T18:24:04] rosheee: but yah ^^
[2023-10-27T18:24:17] francois schempers: Well if I was not my weight I'm sure I can hit that too üòÇ
[2023-10-27T18:24:23] rosheee: u know me @francois_schempers üòÜuntil plugs on esc melt themself off
[2023-10-27T18:24:27] rosheee: XD
[2023-10-27T18:24:31] francois schempers: üòÇüòÇ
[2023-10-27T18:27:10] rosheee: last g30 esc ^^' the + cable desoldered itself from esc
[2023-10-27T18:27:14] Santiago: Hello guys, I know this is not related to vesc controller but idk where to ask, so my friends owns a kuugo kirin G3 and when pressing the throttle it tries to spin forward and stops, but if pressed again it does the same backwards. What could this be related to?? Halls failing??
[2023-10-27T18:27:15] rosheee: then ^^' sparkorama
[2023-10-27T18:27:52] Jan: Vsett10+ dogshit stability 60kmh+
[2023-10-27T18:28:39] francois schempers: thats nearly what I'm planning to spend on my scooter, and it will be a beast 700‚Ç¨ max g2 (sold all internals and motor for 400) so 300‚Ç¨ 300 ish on controller 300 ish on motor 800-1200 on battery depending on cells and maker I choose and in the end I'll have a 16kW beast that smoke anything not DIY in that price range, so if you're able to tinker stuff, I'll advise to go for DIY instead of premade
[2023-10-27T18:29:39] Santiago: I'll be able to tear it apart tomorrow
[2023-10-27T18:29:45] Jan: Front suspension bends
[2023-10-27T18:29:55] francois schempers: I'm not familiar with that brand I'll leave others to respond ^^
[2023-10-27T18:30:21] francois schempers: yeah that's a cheap change I'm not counting it in my budget ^^
[2023-10-27T18:31:12] Jan: Also with the G2 steering geometey will not be stable enough for +80kph
[2023-10-27T18:31:26] Happy Giraffe: How is that actually possible, frame made of 10mm thick steel?
[2023-10-27T18:31:58] francois schempers: I'm not planing for 80+ I'm planning for absolut torque, I'll be going up mountains üòÇüòÇ
[2023-10-27T18:34:15] Santiago: But generally it should be related to the halls or the ESC failing to make it spin the right way?? Or motor is fried ü•π
[2023-10-27T18:36:06] francois schempers: if it's foc algo it should spin the right way, If it's bldc or other sensor less algo, could go backwards if you start from 0km/h but again, I don't know that scooter ^^ sorry ^^'
[2023-10-27T18:36:28] Santiago: Just asking generally no worries
[2023-10-27T18:36:49] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Did you see its size?
[2023-10-27T18:37:02] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Only one motor is 30kg
[2023-10-27T18:37:26] Santiago: It has hall sensors I've teared it apart once
[2023-10-27T18:42:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Saw 3 what bent front susüòÖ
[2023-10-27T18:44:44] francois schempers: yeah I saw them on Russian forums, definitely will change it üòÇ
[2023-10-27T18:52:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I saw two in rl from that 3
[2023-10-27T19:00:18] Happy Giraffe: But why 50E cellsüòÇ I guess 20p compensates
[2023-10-27T19:02:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: 196 A
[2023-10-27T19:08:18] Happy Giraffe: Thought they would put more as wheels are 20" and have better traction especially at those speeds
[2023-10-27T19:08:34] Happy Giraffe: 200A is what our guys run üòÇ
[2023-10-27T19:22:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I only told A of 20p 50eü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-10-27T19:22:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: True
[2023-10-27T19:39:44] haku: Glad ur okay and your scooter not smashed to bits. This is very salvagable. Nothing really broken
[2023-10-27T19:45:07] haku: I like the new inmotion rs. If i had a wishlist thay will be in it
[2023-10-27T19:49:57] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, either they stick to it or are idiots and take 15-20AüòÖ
[2023-10-27T19:53:41] haku: 10mm steel. More armor than some tanks
[2023-10-27T20:02:27] Gabe Enzo: What drill bit do I need to drill a hole for this screw?
[2023-10-27T20:02:35] Gabe Enzo: it measures as 0.6mm absolute diameter
[2023-10-27T20:03:04] Gabe Enzo: 0.5mm doesn't work but 0.6mm would be too big no?
[2023-10-27T20:03:13] Gabe Enzo: It would have no space for tightness
[2023-10-27T20:06:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Not sure if you find smaller easy than 1mm
[2023-10-27T20:06:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also a drill that can hold tight and wont broke that tiny stuff
[2023-10-27T20:06:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What's it for ?
[2023-10-27T20:09:09] Gabe Enzo: New brake caliper on the Xiaomi
[2023-10-27T20:09:30] Gabe Enzo: I drilled a bigger hole here: but it is still too small to fit the necessary screw
[2023-10-27T20:09:36] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_10561@27-10-2023_20-09-36.jpg>
[2023-10-27T20:10:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Thats like m6 mate not 0,6
[2023-10-27T20:10:51] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_10562@27-10-2023_20-10-51.jpg>
[2023-10-27T20:10:56] Gabe Enzo: Ya
[2023-10-27T20:11:08] Gabe Enzo: So what do I need to do this
[2023-10-27T20:11:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well you need to drill and cut thread inside
[2023-10-27T20:11:56] Gabe Enzo: Huh, this is new to me
[2023-10-27T20:11:57] Gabe Enzo: uh
[2023-10-27T20:12:02] Gabe Enzo: cut a thread inside? how
[2023-10-27T20:13:13] Gabe Enzo: this'll work
[2023-10-27T20:13:19] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_10563@27-10-2023_20-13-19.jpg>
[2023-10-27T20:13:20] Gabe Enzo: Haha
[2023-10-27T20:14:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Normaly does holes m5 size
[2023-10-27T20:15:06] Gabe Enzo: Doesn't work in my case
[2023-10-27T20:15:08] Gabe Enzo: p weird
[2023-10-27T20:15:14] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What drill bit was used when drilling?
[2023-10-27T20:15:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Coz one size bigger is what you can cut in
[2023-10-27T20:16:18] Gabe Enzo: 5mm
[2023-10-27T20:16:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Nor really good for holes what has an end ,also low quality If you overforce any thread cutter it brake's and its a mess to get it out
[2023-10-27T20:16:50] Gabe Enzo: I only need it to work one time.
[2023-10-27T20:16:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So probably you only got the sidebof the old thread down
[2023-10-27T20:17:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Doesnt matter if you broke it in a sec
[2023-10-27T20:17:40] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2023-10-27T20:17:54] Gabe Enzo: then I'll drill through with a normal drill first
[2023-10-27T20:18:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: What
[2023-10-27T20:18:32] Gabe Enzo: You said it's not good for holes that have an end
[2023-10-27T20:18:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: <photos/photo_10564@27-10-2023_20-18-33.jpg>
[2023-10-27T20:18:35] Gabe Enzo: so I'll get rid of the end first
[2023-10-27T20:18:43] Gabe Enzo: o
[2023-10-27T20:18:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Left is a hand version
[2023-10-27T20:18:48] Gabe Enzo: do those work for anything
[2023-10-27T20:18:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Less easy to brake
[2023-10-27T20:19:00] Gabe Enzo: that too
[2023-10-27T20:19:01] Gabe Enzo: ?
[2023-10-27T20:19:15] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Main thing is this is a slow thing ,like one forward 2 backwords
[2023-10-27T20:19:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Machine versions not good in a hand drill
[2023-10-27T20:19:52] Gabe Enzo: I have a Bosch drill
[2023-10-27T20:19:53] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I get it now
[2023-10-27T20:20:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: It could be any type
[2023-10-27T20:20:18] Gabe Enzo: so I just gotta not force it ya
[2023-10-27T20:20:22] Gabe Enzo: just easy
[2023-10-27T20:20:29] Gabe Enzo: I have no other chance at this
[2023-10-27T20:20:33] Gabe Enzo: I've already ruined this frame if I did
[2023-10-27T20:20:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Main thing is frame not holded by a vise and drill is not a fix type where you huge arm holds
[2023-10-27T20:20:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: This is why i say
[2023-10-27T20:21:19] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Is there any metal working company around you ,they would do in no time
[2023-10-27T20:21:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And you dont need the tools etc
[2023-10-27T20:22:02] Gabe Enzo: sadly nope on my own
[2023-10-27T20:22:18] Gabe Enzo: like I could drive there with no brakes when I do fix it
[2023-10-27T20:22:21] Gabe Enzo: Lemme check
[2023-10-27T20:22:25] Gabe Enzo: if there's one near
[2023-10-27T20:23:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You still have engine brake
[2023-10-27T20:23:45] Gabe Enzo: 8km away nearest metalwork place
[2023-10-27T20:23:47] Gabe Enzo: not Bad
[2023-10-27T20:23:47] haku: Get the one on the left @Megacorporate because the other one is only good for thru holes
[2023-10-27T20:24:10] Gabe Enzo: Could just risk it. which I might because I'm me.
[2023-10-27T20:24:19] Gabe Enzo: @Her0DasH give the link

[2023-10-27T20:26:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Ohhh
[2023-10-27T20:26:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I would say the same
[2023-10-27T20:26:52] Gabe Enzo: I've no time to go places. so I'll risk it.
[2023-10-27T20:26:59] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Hit local shop where you can buy tools
[2023-10-27T20:27:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: That's fastest possible

[2023-10-27T20:31:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yes usually there is few ways to hold manual thingy
[2023-10-27T20:31:45] Gabe Enzo: I'm using this drill bit on my frame too.
[2023-10-27T20:31:56] Gabe Enzo: I'm gonna drill 2 holes to squish down the vesc with a slab of metal
[2023-10-27T20:32:01] Gabe Enzo: Like @KierreKikkeli did
[2023-10-27T20:32:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: This is thread cutter by hand ,should be done by hand
[2023-10-27T20:32:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: This why i said the local workshop
[2023-10-27T20:32:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: One tool needs the other
[2023-10-27T20:33:07] Gabe Enzo: So if I drill then I get a 100% chance of failure
[2023-10-27T20:33:11] puneDir: I have this nice one
[2023-10-27T20:33:17] Gabe Enzo: or what
[2023-10-27T20:34:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Manual tool use hands ,not a drill you will either broke the tool or fuck thread up
[2023-10-27T20:34:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: There is few holders what you can buy or use patent plier but thats shit
[2023-10-27T20:35:30] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I use different stuff what i make for them since the more small you cant use the holders or if no space
[2023-10-27T20:35:39] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_10567@27-10-2023_20-35-39.jpg>
[2023-10-27T20:36:10] Gabe Enzo: Trash?
[2023-10-27T20:36:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Similar but this is drill only
[2023-10-27T20:36:34] Gabe Enzo: You can put the other one inside
[2023-10-27T20:36:39] Gabe Enzo: it has 3 teeth
[2023-10-27T20:36:40] Pablo Fernandez: I use that for Warhammer lol
[2023-10-27T20:36:42] Gabe Enzo: it can hold any
[2023-10-27T20:36:56] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I cheat Welding them in old drill bits with brass and there you have a tool
[2023-10-27T20:37:15] Gabe Enzo: Wait I'm confused
[2023-10-27T20:37:25] Gabe Enzo: so I don't need a hand tool
[2023-10-27T20:37:38] Gabe Enzo: You can't twist that manually tho
[2023-10-27T20:38:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: BroüòÖ

[2023-10-27T20:44:06] Gabe Enzo: I infact did
[2023-10-27T20:44:14] Gabe Enzo: I was thinking for days how to do it
[2023-10-27T20:44:19] Gabe Enzo: until it ringed in my mind
[2023-10-27T20:44:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Show it it happens
[2023-10-27T20:46:35] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_10561@27-10-2023_20-09-36.jpg>
[2023-10-27T20:46:53] Gabe Enzo: you mean show you my idea?
[2023-10-27T20:47:09] Gabe Enzo: I'm doing all of this cause I wanted 135mm
[2023-10-27T20:47:17] Gabe Enzo: discs
[2023-10-27T20:47:48] Gabe Enzo: 2 washers there and bam perfect
[2023-10-27T20:50:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I mean when its done ,also do pads grip disc properly?
[2023-10-27T20:55:54] haku: That was me before too. But most amazon products you can get it cheaper in ali. Im just frugal af
[2023-10-27T22:19:04] Happy Giraffe: Whats the problemüòÇ If you want M6 metric thread then drill 5mm hole and tap threads thereüòÖ
[2023-10-27T22:19:36] Happy Giraffe: Easy to do there by hand when you remove rear tire
[2023-10-27T22:19:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Basically yes
[2023-10-27T22:20:19] Happy Giraffe: Drill bit he snaps in 5 secondsüòÅ
[2023-10-27T22:20:36] Gabe Enzo: I did
[2023-10-27T22:21:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: üòÅ
[2023-10-27T22:21:03] Gabe Enzo: Exactly what I'm going to do
[2023-10-27T22:21:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: This brake's easy
[2023-10-27T22:21:12] Happy Giraffe: Oh god pls no
[2023-10-27T22:21:17] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-10-27T22:21:38] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I had ond ready just to make a pics
[2023-10-27T22:21:49] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Basically snaps if overforced
[2023-10-27T22:22:07] Gabe Enzo: you wouldn't even get it straight in
[2023-10-27T22:22:11] Gabe Enzo: that what she said
[2023-10-27T22:22:14] Happy Giraffe: Alu frame soft but still with talent possible to snapüòÇ
[2023-10-27T22:23:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also the real thing is when you make thread to some thick steel ,than you need much better tools and the real thread cutter what is actually from 3 steps cutting,that makes the perfect thread only
[2023-10-27T22:24:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: These toys compared to that
[2023-10-27T22:24:21] Happy Giraffe: Yeah you gotta have a through holeüòÅ
[2023-10-27T22:24:37] Happy Giraffe: I want thisüòÅ
[2023-10-27T22:24:46] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If he does it by machine its easy ,since he doenst feel or could stop drill in time
[2023-10-27T22:25:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Than force snaps it ,not to mention if it brakes low and thread holds back its a motherfucker to get it out
[2023-10-27T22:25:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Soon you can do it
[2023-10-27T22:26:40] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Its from a broken bit holder, with flame cutter you heat it up ,pick broken shit out ,, put cutter in and brass weld with flame
[2023-10-27T22:28:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But basically this called brazing
[2023-10-27T22:28:13] Happy Giraffe: Paul Brody style
[2023-10-27T22:28:46] Happy Giraffe: Or if I feel like menace, 3D print from carbon fiber materialüòÅ I wonder how those handle the torque
[2023-10-27T22:29:23] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Not sure if it can hold it ,but you can try

[2023-10-28T00:48:27] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Do so but dont overestimate
[2023-10-28T00:59:24] haku: Adc wire harness. Hope this works
[2023-10-28T01:00:43] Yamal: Hello people, would anyone know the winding of these engines? thank you and greetings. Naccotech 65h
[2023-10-28T01:00:59] Yamal: https://youtu.be/v_9nNqm1OmY?si=aldjrkQER7AiJ62L
[2023-10-28T01:02:34] Yamal: I don't really know the winding they have, I have asked them to see if they answer, because they are old motors
[2023-10-28T01:24:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs Ly motor
[2023-10-28T01:26:08] Pablo Fernandez: im always close to pulling the trigger on a surron man
[2023-10-28T01:26:23] Yamal: Wending?
[2023-10-28T01:26:24] Pablo Fernandez: and on a gt3 tbh lol

[2023-10-28T01:45:04] haku: Looks like a fast motot
[2023-10-28T01:45:37] haku: Where do you buy that?
[2023-10-28T01:46:55] Yamal: I bought it from a friend, and we don't know the winding
[2023-10-28T01:47:57] haku: Nice!
[2023-10-28T01:49:55] Gabe Enzo: wouldnt have been here to learn a lesson without the helmet
[2023-10-28T01:50:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: I still don‚Äôt have X-ray eyeüòÇ
[2023-10-28T01:51:16] Yamal: No,! I thought maybe you know them
[2023-10-28T01:51:38] haku: Gear is a must imo.
[2023-10-28T01:54:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: They do much version based on customer request
[2023-10-28T01:54:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: So I can‚Äôt know if I don‚Äôt see inside
[2023-10-28T02:04:22] KierreKikkeli: slap a drill on low torque and screw mode and it works just fine, have used it that way to make hundreds of threads without issue xd
[2023-10-28T02:04:53] KierreKikkeli: also i just found out the spintend adc v2 light port is 3.3V...... HOW IN THE FUCK DID IT BRICK THE OG LIGHT?
[2023-10-28T02:06:03] KierreKikkeli: trying to install a 12v H3 halogen onto it only to find out it doesnt give enough power....
[2023-10-28T02:08:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: Halongen xd
[2023-10-28T02:08:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Obviously you don‚Äôt got enough power
[2023-10-28T02:09:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: It consumes more than the IC maximum supported current
[2023-10-28T02:09:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Led consumes like 10 times less
[2023-10-28T02:10:02] KierreKikkeli: 12v is 12v, works on a pc psu should work on the adc v2 aswell
[2023-10-28T02:10:34] KierreKikkeli: except either the 12v headlight needs a switch or it got itself fried along the rear lights
[2023-10-28T02:10:41] KierreKikkeli: so need a new adc xd
[2023-10-28T02:12:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: Pc psu is 600w bro
[2023-10-28T02:12:24] KierreKikkeli: Wut? What button
[2023-10-28T02:12:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: Spintend adc is like 30w and 40 peak
[2023-10-28T02:12:38] KierreKikkeli: Not the 20y old 200w km using
[2023-10-28T02:12:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yeah, still more than spintend
[2023-10-28T02:13:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: Looks how small is compared to your psu
[2023-10-28T02:13:10] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: One side buttons, Other features lets say
[2023-10-28T02:13:22] KierreKikkeli: Yeah those ones dead prob or need to use a random button for it
[2023-10-28T02:13:55] KierreKikkeli: Yeah xd
[2023-10-28T02:14:01] KierreKikkeli: I got it chill
[2023-10-28T02:14:17] KierreKikkeli: The mosfets are still dead on lights on the adc
[2023-10-28T02:14:55] KierreKikkeli: Yeah
[2023-10-28T02:15:02] KierreKikkeli: Yup
[2023-10-28T02:15:31] KierreKikkeli: It burned the stock front light :(
[2023-10-28T02:15:41] KierreKikkeli: Its H1 with a wire xd
[2023-10-28T02:16:00] KierreKikkeli: So the weakest there is
[2023-10-28T02:16:16] KierreKikkeli: Connecting it to the button on adc xd
[2023-10-28T02:16:46] KierreKikkeli: It worked for about 15mins
[2023-10-28T02:18:04] KierreKikkeli: Also with the psu test i stole one half of the 50w 12v rail pcie connector power cables so the scoot should handle it just fine
[2023-10-28T02:18:40] KierreKikkeli: If a car or a moped battery can handle it then a 12s absolutely should
[2023-10-28T02:19:02] KierreKikkeli: They seem to work just fine
[2023-10-28T02:19:20] KierreKikkeli: With good luck it might be only the rear lights that wont work
[2023-10-28T02:42:45] KierreKikkeli: do i actually need a switch for the light or can i just short it permanently by connecting the ground to the 3.3v?
[2023-10-28T02:48:41] KierreKikkeli: hek yea
[2023-10-28T02:49:24] KierreKikkeli: and when someday when i can afford it ill get a proper handle bar switch set for the lights and all
[2023-10-28T02:57:44] KierreKikkeli: WOOO it works
[2023-10-28T02:57:53] KierreKikkeli: no magic smoke and gives 12.05v
[2023-10-28T03:02:55] KierreKikkeli: <video_file>
[2023-10-28T03:04:06] KierreKikkeli: Now we know car/motorbike lamps will work just fine
[2023-10-28T03:31:08] haku: Anyone know where to buy turn signals like this. Like the ones on the vsett?
[2023-10-28T04:04:56] KierreKikkeli: <video_file>
[2023-10-28T04:05:41] KierreKikkeli: Small issue, its a recap of melting light housing again
[2023-10-28T04:06:31] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: Cringe
[2023-10-28T04:07:48] KierreKikkeli: Thats a cars headlight on a scoot
[2023-10-28T04:08:06] Arsenus Proüá∫üá¶: cringe x2
[2023-10-28T04:08:36] KierreKikkeli: It was on for a minute and melted the housing ü§î
[2023-10-28T04:14:12] Unknown: The bulb üí° has too much wattage
[2023-10-28T04:20:02] KierreKikkeli: I think the issue is on the fact its not a led, even if i buy a 35w one its gonna be equally hot üòë
[2023-10-28T04:26:13] haku: I think the holes are for when you want to screw it in instead of soldering. Not to sure though
[2023-10-28T04:32:23] JPPL: It's for women make earrings
[2023-10-28T04:59:41] rosheee: yes rofl i rly write them email and tell them they should come angerville with their 1million maxima hyper carbon fiber scooters and take their super whatever and idk why choose these riders and then show them full send bagetteria of france their marketing and their drivers (insta n stuff) reflects their driving...this not professional ... it is more a joke race ....idk what dat team @ williams f1 thought when doing something like this.. u build something and flex that u spend 1million to develop and then this? and WTF WHY THEY FALL? also i think their scooters never fucked..rly... for 1 million and OFFICIAL ESKOOTR LEAGUE we all expected 20kw at least more 30kw and high speeds and true racing...
[2023-10-28T06:37:51] haku: Is the correct start point and end point for spinny?
[2023-10-28T06:37:51] haku: <photos/photo_10593@28-10-2023_06-37-51.jpg>
[2023-10-28T09:36:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes but actually they are x) pushed 24KW and it was barely warm at 80¬∞C (up to 180¬∞C) on track circuit with 600A phase
[2023-10-28T09:55:59] KierreKikkeli: Time to try out a 12v 4w ba9
[2023-10-28T09:59:47] KierreKikkeli: Atleast its not melting the plastic and they bulbs are cheap while having a wide range of wattages
[2023-10-28T10:00:32] KierreKikkeli: Added bonus seems to be that its un shortable
[2023-10-28T10:09:24] KierreKikkeli: Same store also sells affordable led blinker sets and rear lights, so just need a new adc and the handlebar switches
[2023-10-28T10:13:39] puneDir: Why use halogen
[2023-10-28T11:09:14] Mirono escooters: Because you are using halogen? üòÜüòÜüòÜ
[2023-10-28T11:10:07] Mirono escooters: Halogen mainly produces heat, and light is EXTRA Led produces light, and some heat extra
[2023-10-28T11:10:14] Mirono escooters: You really surprised it melts? Oh god
[2023-10-28T11:51:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Nope ,hole should be on top side when you solder , as the solder melts , you can make sure that melted inside properly , as you see over the hole that it's boiling in as you take solder iron away, if overflows too much or too much for first, I use to hold it like i said , Solder iron under and apply solder from hole by First
[2023-10-28T11:52:12] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Halogen always hot as fuck
[2023-10-28T11:52:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Better forget does
[2023-10-28T11:59:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Indeed Kinda lame to fall this much , Back in the day They said only professional racing ppl will be in the race ,but they are pretty far from that , Also would say the tracks made lame for this ,if you know your scooters not able to do that, why using a track what ends up in this . Last video what we saw from @SibClimb clearly beats them allü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-10-28T12:01:24] Mirono escooters: It's very doable
[2023-10-28T12:01:48] Mirono escooters: You can plug the holes with the wire, more secure
[2023-10-28T12:03:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And where is Raff?
[2023-10-28T12:40:30] Gabe Enzo: Why does the Xiaomi dash need a resistor
[2023-10-28T12:40:31] Gabe Enzo: ?
[2023-10-28T12:41:17] Mirono escooters: To filter out unwanted noise
[2023-10-28T12:41:36] Gabe Enzo: is that a fancy word for I don't need to add a resistor
[2023-10-28T12:41:52] Gabe Enzo: seems i need to buy one
[2023-10-28T12:43:19] Mirono escooters: That is NOT a fancy word for you dont need it
[2023-10-28T12:43:21] Mirono escooters: ü§¶ü§¶
[2023-10-28T12:43:36] Mirono escooters: *doesn't understand it* Concludes it's not needed
[2023-10-28T12:43:39] Mirono escooters: Best engineer
[2023-10-28T12:46:41] Gabe Enzo: I have set my house on fire before
[2023-10-28T12:48:57] Mirono escooters: Why am I not surprised ?
[2023-10-28T13:06:31] Gabe Enzo: This is what I need yeah? what do the watt ratings mean?
[2023-10-28T13:06:47] Mirono escooters: :-(
[2023-10-28T13:07:02] Mirono escooters: Have a guess? How many watts can go through it without burning?
[2023-10-28T13:07:14] puneDir: Sup myself
[2023-10-28T13:07:35] Mirono escooters: Sometimes I think I'm in a simulation and I'm just being tested
[2023-10-28T13:07:40] puneDir: Yes
[2023-10-28T13:07:49] Mirono escooters: Electron, come on Even AI can answer that Even GOOGLE can
[2023-10-28T13:07:50] Gabe Enzo: But only the ohm rating matters
[2023-10-28T13:07:52] Mirono escooters: We aren't your personal AI
[2023-10-28T13:07:54] Mirono escooters: Oh god
[2023-10-28T13:07:59] Mirono escooters: For the G30/ Xiaomi dash yes
[2023-10-28T13:08:29] Mirono escooters: Nothing personal, but come on, you can hopefully see you spam everywhere everyday basic stuff
[2023-10-28T13:08:33] Gabe Enzo: Lol stop same but not for electrical.shit
[2023-10-28T13:08:38] Gabe Enzo: I understand

[2023-10-28T13:12:08] francois schempers: we could put some rules in place, like if you only are two talking, instead of doing +100 msg, go in private, or limit a bit off topic subjects
[2023-10-28T13:12:14] Mirono escooters: Please
[2023-10-28T13:12:26] Mirono escooters: I'm getting frustrated with it

[2023-10-28T16:04:09] haku: Is this on a scooter or a ebike?
[2023-10-28T16:06:48] Happy Giraffe: To push solder wire through thereüòÅ
[2023-10-28T16:12:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: Single hole is good, but here I see double hole lol
[2023-10-28T16:15:57] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: From this point of view it's not best place for this yeah
[2023-10-28T16:16:03] Mirono escooters: Flipsky 75100 ü§Øüòç
[2023-10-28T16:16:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: Our city got destroyed because of weather üôÅüôÅ

[2023-10-28T16:21:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: Forli, Faenza, Cesena
[2023-10-28T16:22:06] Rogerio Figueiredo: Hello my friends 1 question that doesn't has anything to do with vesc.
[2023-10-28T16:22:29] Rogerio Figueiredo: Does the dualtron dt3 frame equal to the dualtron Victor in terms of size
[2023-10-28T16:22:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Government give money to region for build infrastructure which prevent disaster like this, but they didn‚Äôt spent and return the money, and that happened
[2023-10-28T16:32:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Jeez
[2023-10-28T16:33:22] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Just watched some videos

[2023-10-28T16:45:08] Rogerio Figueiredo: I was asking about dualtron to use it to do vesc project
[2023-10-28T16:47:04] francois schempers: your fine, those guidelines have nothing to do with your question, they are put to prevent future hiccups
[2023-10-28T16:47:25] Mirono escooters: Yes, coincidence xd
[2023-10-28T16:47:32] Mirono escooters: Rogerio very good boy
[2023-10-28T16:50:33] Luis Magalhaes: A bit gay but dont worry üòÇ
[2023-10-28T16:54:52] Mirono escooters: A bit gay is okay
[2023-10-28T17:01:05] NetworkDir: Xt90 can handle ~100A without melting? Or directly solder better
[2023-10-28T17:02:07] Mirono escooters: There r 2 answers
[2023-10-28T17:02:15] Mirono escooters: Official: no Real: problably, yes. Many do it
[2023-10-28T17:02:25] Mirono escooters: Real amass is a good start. Better tolerances
[2023-10-28T17:03:05] NetworkDir: Sure
[2023-10-28T17:03:18] NetworkDir: 100A at peak should okay
[2023-10-28T17:03:20] Happy Giraffe: Get QS-8 or put dual 90
[2023-10-28T17:04:23] NetworkDir: And mr60 can handle continuous 60A (i mean battery current 60A maybe with higher phase it‚Äôs melt)
[2023-10-28T17:04:25] Happy Giraffe: This also depends on weather etc. if connector makes contact with air outside going 50kmh it will naturally get cooling. If put in a tight space then it will heat moreüòÅ
[2023-10-28T17:04:33] Happy Giraffe: Not continuous, peak
[2023-10-28T17:04:51] NetworkDir: Hmm
[2023-10-28T17:04:53] Happy Giraffe: XT90 rated for continuous 45A Also consider your cable size for 100A
[2023-10-28T17:05:09] NetworkDir: So for motor phases i need new connectors
[2023-10-28T17:05:18] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 45A continious
[2023-10-28T17:05:49] Happy Giraffe: Motor phase is not continuous as its switching but definitely go 6mm bullet XT150 or AS150
[2023-10-28T17:06:15] NetworkDir: Or direct solderü•¥
[2023-10-28T17:06:36] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: 30A
[2023-10-28T17:07:10] Happy Giraffe: If you want to switch tire etc its nice to be able to remove
[2023-10-28T17:07:39] Happy Giraffe: Just use proper connectors, getting a massive fire because one battery connector aint fun
[2023-10-28T17:07:56] NetworkDir: At first I thought banana bullets might not be available and expensive I checked and saw that it is there and it is not expensive
[2023-10-28T17:08:13] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_10603@28-10-2023_17-08-13.jpg>
[2023-10-28T17:08:40] JPPL: A few rules on the chat would help
[2023-10-28T17:08:47] JPPL: Tittle says a lot
[2023-10-28T17:08:51] Happy Giraffe: For 100A motor phase 4mm plug should also be enough
[2023-10-28T17:09:07] Mirono escooters: Very conservative rating tho
[2023-10-28T17:09:12] Mirono escooters: Big bullet connector
[2023-10-28T17:09:18] Mirono escooters: Real amass does a lot
[2023-10-28T17:09:23] JPPL: Xt90 handle 100a no problem
[2023-10-28T17:09:29] Mirono escooters: Ofc not expensive
[2023-10-28T17:09:31] JPPL: For long
[2023-10-28T17:09:38] Mirono escooters: This best, conical
[2023-10-28T17:09:45] Mirono escooters: Not the banana style with the spring contacts
[2023-10-28T17:09:53] Mirono escooters: That does a lot of difference
[2023-10-28T17:10:08] Mirono escooters: Bad contact and grip
[2023-10-28T17:10:10] NetworkDir: Nice
[2023-10-28T17:10:12] Mirono escooters: Conical one total contac t
[2023-10-28T17:11:16] NetworkDir: In two or three weeks, let's see if we can reach 13kW with ubox and 20süòÅ
[2023-10-28T17:11:50] JPPL: Enjoy the project
[2023-10-28T17:12:04] NetworkDir: to see if dualtron is faster or vesc poweredüòÇ
[2023-10-28T17:12:37] NetworkDir: Shunt modded dualtron ü•¥
[2023-10-28T17:13:34] JPPL: All depends on vesc settings
[2023-10-28T17:15:05] NetworkDir: Yes of course Max duty - ramp time - phase - traction control
[2023-10-28T17:15:17] JPPL: I'm building similar vesc setup on a teverun
[2023-10-28T17:15:26] JPPL: ubox 100v x 2
[2023-10-28T17:15:36] NetworkDir: Oh it‚Äôs very good
[2023-10-28T17:15:54] NetworkDir: With stock battery?
[2023-10-28T17:16:34] JPPL: <video_file>
[2023-10-28T17:16:58] JPPL: 11x battery for test and then costum made with 40T 350a discharge +-
[2023-10-28T17:17:33] NetworkDir: I think teverun stock batt is samsung 50E
[2023-10-28T17:17:41] NetworkDir: But 50E discharge very low
[2023-10-28T17:18:01] NetworkDir: 10A üòê
[2023-10-28T17:18:21] JPPL: I have an original teverun yes, mine I don't think is 50E, was one from 1 stock
[2023-10-28T17:18:55] JPPL: This one is hand mounted by me and vesc will rock it, clean setup
[2023-10-28T17:19:41] JPPL: Let's keep rocking ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2023-10-28T18:00:35] Rogerio Figueiredo: Haha üòÇ
[2023-10-28T18:00:50] Rogerio Figueiredo: You like it
[2023-10-28T18:00:54] Gabe Enzo: Lol I was missing a jst 7 pin for my esc but found one when I was disassembling the Xiaomi BMS
[2023-10-28T18:00:57] Gabe Enzo: Call that luck
[2023-10-28T18:02:15] Rogerio Figueiredo: U never stop
[2023-10-28T18:02:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: It can does much more than 10A, but you will no get the datasheet‚Äôs cycle life
[2023-10-28T18:03:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: Miss blade/teverun very much üò¢
[2023-10-28T18:18:13] Mirono escooters: But 5ah
[2023-10-28T18:24:38] NetworkDir: Yes sure
[2023-10-28T18:25:11] NetworkDir: Yes but with 5ah battery pack lower parallels and lower discharge
[2023-10-28T18:27:42] NetworkDir: Superme version is 35Ah
[2023-10-28T18:27:52] NetworkDir: 20s7p
[2023-10-28T18:28:02] NetworkDir: Max 100A discharge total
[2023-10-28T18:28:07] NetworkDir: 50-50A per motor
[2023-10-28T18:28:53] NetworkDir: It is good for use with stock current controllers, but in my opinion, it is not suitable for more currents
[2023-10-28T18:29:43] NetworkDir: I see shunted bms and controller (teverun superme) He push 200A üíÄ with max 100A batt
[2023-10-28T18:30:04] NetworkDir: He battery life should 10 cyclesüòÇ
[2023-10-28T18:40:43] Happy Giraffe: And gives 4.75Ah at 10A load so decent one
[2023-10-28T18:45:10] francois schempers: unless p45b üòé
[2023-10-28T18:58:38] Mirono escooters: Well, NAMI used 50e too and pulled a lot
[2023-10-28T18:58:42] Mirono escooters: 50e handle more power then datasheet
[2023-10-28T18:58:50] Mirono escooters: Yes it's a great great cell
[2023-10-28T18:58:53] Mirono escooters: Especially for the price
[2023-10-28T18:59:01] Mirono escooters: One of Me favo
[2023-10-28T18:59:07] Mirono escooters: Didn't like lg m50lt as much
[2023-10-28T18:59:10] Mirono escooters: M58t tho ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2023-10-28T19:31:20] Rogerio Figueiredo: How you shunt the bms?
[2023-10-28T19:31:58] Mirono escooters: Huh? I thought first gen?
[2023-10-28T19:41:53] NetworkDir: Its not my scooter
[2023-10-28T19:41:58] NetworkDir: Random friend
[2023-10-28T19:42:33] Rogerio Figueiredo: Hum ok
[2023-10-28T20:14:34] KierreKikkeli: Cheap, to prevent moped registeration issues, need to see the road now not someday when monies and local availability
[2023-10-28T20:15:01] Mirono escooters: Tf, 0 reason to use halogen
[2023-10-28T20:16:28] KierreKikkeli: Yes and no, expected but hopeful coz smol
[2023-10-28T20:18:15] Mirono escooters: ü§¶
[2023-10-28T20:18:22] KierreKikkeli: 2‚Ç¨ vs 50-100‚Ç¨ for bulbs which are mainly not qualified for roads, also wanted to use the existing housing for the light
[2023-10-28T20:18:30] Mirono escooters: 50-100‚Ç¨ is not true, at all
[2023-10-28T20:18:34] Mirono escooters: Simple led bulbs cost nothing
[2023-10-28T20:18:45] Mirono escooters: Using halogen is plain dumb. You'll toast everything. Sorry.
[2023-10-28T20:19:02] KierreKikkeli: Not road qualified
[2023-10-28T20:19:08] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-10-28T20:19:45] KierreKikkeli: Ye, going atm for moped/motorcycle bulbs
[2023-10-28T20:20:05] Mirono escooters: I hope you are going for some leds
[2023-10-28T20:20:32] KierreKikkeli: That was the plan, until availability and price here became an issue
[2023-10-28T20:20:39] Mirono escooters: Who is even checking your led INSIDE? The Xiaomi lamp is certified. Its Enough
[2023-10-28T20:20:50] Mirono escooters: Idk what scam shop you went to
[2023-10-28T20:20:56] Mirono escooters: But using halogen is room temp iq
[2023-10-28T20:21:23] puneDir: lmao people use light
[2023-10-28T20:21:28] puneDir: i was using phone flashlight
[2023-10-28T20:21:39] KierreKikkeli: Traffic registeration and popo when i eventually get caught, stock light got fried by adc
[2023-10-28T20:21:48] Mirono escooters: INSIDE?
[2023-10-28T20:21:51] Mirono escooters: You gotta be kidding me
[2023-10-28T20:22:10] Mirono escooters: -Xiaomi led is like 3‚Ç¨ - no one is opening dash to check
[2023-10-28T20:22:26] KierreKikkeli: No they look at the light output and temp
[2023-10-28T20:22:34] Mirono escooters: Once I wire red pants but my rear led failed So flashlight in pants lol
[2023-10-28T20:22:42] Mirono escooters: Oh god, lifeless cops
[2023-10-28T20:22:45] puneDir: :D
[2023-10-28T20:22:52] KierreKikkeli: Very much so
[2023-10-28T20:22:54] Mirono escooters: Buy original led and stop worrying Or use halogen without 100msg here lol
[2023-10-28T20:23:33] KierreKikkeli: Would need to make a 12v to 3v circuit transformation or something
[2023-10-28T20:23:53] Mirono escooters: Stepdown is a wonderful thingü§´
[2023-10-28T20:24:04] KierreKikkeli: Also need the light now
[2023-10-28T20:24:11] Mirono escooters: Idk why you worry about light output No way they check And if do, nose bleed
[2023-10-28T20:24:27] KierreKikkeli: They do -.-
[2023-10-28T20:24:28] Mirono escooters: Any store sells LEDs? Just, a bike lamp?
[2023-10-28T20:24:34] Mirono escooters: It can't be this difficult.
[2023-10-28T20:24:51] KierreKikkeli: Yes but not road usable xd
[2023-10-28T20:25:02] Mirono escooters: üòë
[2023-10-28T20:25:04] KierreKikkeli: Or bicycle lights yes
[2023-10-28T20:25:10] Mirono escooters: Well? Why not do that?
[2023-10-28T20:25:10] KierreKikkeli: No space for em
[2023-10-28T20:25:13] Mirono escooters: üòë
[2023-10-28T20:25:14] KierreKikkeli: And monies
[2023-10-28T20:25:21] Mirono escooters: You are a special man
[2023-10-28T20:26:03] KierreKikkeli: <animation>
[2023-10-28T20:27:07] KierreKikkeli: If i have no lights-> fines and popo will take it away
[2023-10-28T20:27:15] KierreKikkeli: If i have wrong lights same
[2023-10-28T20:27:29] KierreKikkeli: And if i want to register it to be legal, same
[2023-10-28T20:27:38] Mirono escooters: Sounds like you problem at this point kinda
[2023-10-28T20:27:42] Mirono escooters: We tried all we could to help
[2023-10-28T20:28:11] KierreKikkeli: Yea it is, the motorcycle bulbs seem to work fine tho
[2023-10-28T20:28:41] KierreKikkeli: No overheating or melting things at 12v 4w-20w
[2023-10-28T20:29:46] KierreKikkeli: Why 99% of led bulbs are either illegal or expensive here makes no damn sense to me
[2023-10-28T20:30:36] Mirono escooters: Halogen üòë
[2023-10-28T20:30:49] Mirono escooters: Your pcb is cooking
[2023-10-28T20:30:58] Happy Giraffe: Wasted effort on the discussion, so many messages for no benefitüòÖ
[2023-10-28T20:31:16] Mirono escooters: Yes, thats what im trying to conclude
[2023-10-28T20:31:23] Mirono escooters: Yesterday 100msg about stupid led Today Grr
[2023-10-28T20:34:36] KierreKikkeli: Currently just a normal bulb, not halogen
[2023-10-28T20:36:55] KierreKikkeli: Why would the adc care if its an led or not aslong as the power is same?
[2023-10-28T20:39:12] Pablo Fernandez: Why not just using a stepdown?
[2023-10-28T20:43:14] KierreKikkeli: Skill issue on my part and not sure would the escoot stock light be traffic approved
[2023-10-28T20:45:00] KierreKikkeli: If basic 12v moped bulbs work without issues why not use em, if they dont ill just need to save up and wait, but for now need to see the road somehow as its pitch dark here past 5-6pm
[2023-10-28T20:45:14] KierreKikkeli: Winter came within a week xd
[2023-10-28T20:47:54] Mirono escooters: You do you End of discussion
[2023-10-28T20:47:57] Mirono escooters: No one can win here
[2023-10-28T20:48:12] puneDir: Yay mirolino is admin
[2023-10-28T20:48:39] puneDir: gral
[2023-10-28T20:48:49] KierreKikkeli: Yeah
[2023-10-28T20:50:24] KierreKikkeli: If it works thats that, if it doesnt need to save up for bulky wacky leds
[2023-10-28T20:54:51] Mirono escooters: I am your master now
[2023-10-28T20:54:55] Mirono escooters: You obey me

[2023-10-28T21:44:17] haku: Get it from ali express. 12v led headlights are plentiful and very affordable
[2023-10-28T22:04:18] haku: Wich vesc is that?
[2023-10-28T23:03:00] KierreKikkeli: Still illegal to use and cops have no priority managment here
[2023-10-28T23:05:05] KierreKikkeli: Also cant register it as a moped with illegal lights xd
[2023-10-28T23:06:07] haku: Crazy laws. Led less energy.
[2023-10-28T23:08:56] haku: If halogen is only choice. Wire it on a seperate 12v battery. That might fry adc
[2023-10-28T23:10:01] haku: It will be costly but reliable
[2023-10-28T23:10:42] Mirono escooters: Stop the led discussion
[2023-10-28T23:22:15] Gabe Enzo: Oh hell
[2023-10-28T23:42:11] haku: @jamessoderstrom you said maximum wattage of adc adapter is 40w?

[2023-10-28T23:43:38] haku: Gotcha. Thanks
[2023-10-28T23:44:02] haku: 18w headlight might be too much. Thats what i have wired
[2023-10-28T23:46:48] haku: Yea. Its not too bad
[2023-10-28T23:46:48] haku: <photos/photo_10605@28-10-2023_23-46-48.jpg>
[2023-10-28T23:56:27] haku: Is there a vesc that can match bac8k?
[2023-10-28T23:58:10] haku: No way. Thats good to hear.
[2023-10-29T00:15:09] francois schempers: be aware of auto eyesight, don't blind them üòú
[2023-10-29T00:16:23] haku: Agreed i tested alot of angles and asked people driving. I have it mounted low and at an angle.
[2023-10-29T00:17:12] haku: Its too dark around my area. So many rocks and animals crossing the road.
[2023-10-29T00:17:29] cihan: Some of them really need and deserve it. They can just drive on your path while you're on the main road. Or some of them doesn't really care about the upcoming traffic and can open the driver door while you pass by them. I realized that stronger headlight certainly decreases frequency of such events but I blind much more good drivers to avoid those careless ones, that's the sad part.

[2023-10-29T01:37:29] haku: I think it would be difficult to crimp those. But thats a skill issue for me
[2023-10-29T01:37:43] Pablo Fernandez: females are always needed indeed
[2023-10-29T01:37:49] Happy Giraffe: Thats why they come with cables already I also never crimped, bought ready wire
[2023-10-29T01:39:42] haku: Good idea! Even soldering males to cables or boards is difficult for me
[2023-10-29T02:52:34] haku: Is there a vesc auto turn off feature after X amount of minuites?
[2023-10-29T02:56:32] haku: Do you know if spintend has it?

[2023-10-29T03:08:50] haku: Also i reduced positive ramp time to 0
[2023-10-29T03:43:21] Finn: You need to ramp up your absolute max
[2023-10-29T03:55:31] haku: I will try that. Thank you

[2023-10-29T04:20:26] KierreKikkeli: Ayyy it works, fits and doesnt melt the housing at 4w, need to test the 10w and 20w ones aswell as the theoritical limit of the adc is somewhere around 35w
[2023-10-29T04:21:10] KierreKikkeli: Barely more than hand temp after 5-15mins
[2023-10-29T08:18:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: Why would she ?
[2023-10-29T13:05:33] Thierry: I made this part to improve stiffness, good improvement. If it can be useful for someone.
[2023-10-29T13:05:56] Mirono escooters: Good idea
[2023-10-29T13:06:47] Thierry: Still monorim but bring more stability

[2023-10-29T13:09:28] Mirono escooters: 100%
[2023-10-29T13:09:59] Thierry: Better to send the picture to monorim
[2023-10-29T13:10:05] Mirono escooters: They wont do it
[2023-10-29T13:10:10] Mirono escooters: Or in v12 maybe, out of plastic
[2023-10-29T13:10:16] Thierry: It took me too many times
[2023-10-29T13:10:31] Mirono escooters: Id order 20 on jlcpcb from stainless steel

[2023-10-29T13:15:15] Mirono escooters: Have a drawing for it? Ive got access to cnc
[2023-10-29T13:15:19] Mirono escooters: I'd make some for free for the group
[2023-10-29T13:16:07] Thierry: I can share step file
[2023-10-29T13:16:56] Thierry: But depends on opening, shock diameter so might be not compatible with different configuration.
[2023-10-29T13:17:18] Thierry: I send the step then check if it suits for yours
[2023-10-29T13:18:35] Mirono escooters: Would be nice
[2023-10-29T13:18:49] Mirono escooters: Hmm, would need to make universal
[2023-10-29T13:19:06] Mirono escooters: It's threaded yes?
[2023-10-29T13:19:17] Thierry: Yes
[2023-10-29T13:19:54] Mirono escooters: Smort
[2023-10-29T13:22:31] Mirono escooters: Yeh

[2023-10-29T13:23:40] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-10-29T13:23:50] Mirono escooters: New axles and tolerances, and it can actually be "decent"
[2023-10-29T13:23:53] Mirono escooters: Yep, I know
[2023-10-29T13:24:48] Thierry: Still not very stiff
[2023-10-29T13:25:07] Mirono escooters: You need some 12.9 steel axles
[2023-10-29T13:25:10] Mirono escooters: And some good tolerances
[2023-10-29T13:25:16] Mirono escooters: Monoshit has soooo much tolerances lol
[2023-10-29T13:26:26] Thierry: I will send you the drawing for default configuration, mine is a bit different, enlarged.
[2023-10-29T13:26:50] Thierry: Important to replace all screws by decent m8
[2023-10-29T13:27:19] Thierry: And regularly change bearing
[2023-10-29T13:27:52] Mirono escooters: Haha yzs

[2023-10-29T18:04:58] Santiago: I'm willing to buy one if you make it out of stainless steel
[2023-10-29T18:22:16] haku: Does pcbway or jlcpcb make cnc aluminum?
[2023-10-29T18:32:16] Mirono escooters: Pcbway I think

[2023-10-29T22:27:56] Gabe Enzo: You're kidding
[2023-10-29T22:28:54] Pablo Fernandez: First time my grey came home he fell off the perch to the ground, almost got a heart attack since he was still a baby
[2023-10-29T22:28:55] Gabe Enzo: Polly wants a phase wire!
[2023-10-29T22:30:28] NetworkDir: Guys the lishen lr2170sa cells are good?
[2023-10-29T22:30:31] NetworkDir: 4000mAh
[2023-10-29T22:30:32] NetworkDir: 3C
[2023-10-29T22:37:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No I am still on the old version
[2023-10-29T22:42:12] Happy Giraffe: How much current you need per cell?
[2023-10-29T22:42:42] NetworkDir: idk how much is max
[2023-10-29T22:43:47] NetworkDir: like 15A ?
[2023-10-29T22:51:26] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: g30
[2023-10-29T22:51:36] Konstantin: 12/18 fets?
[2023-10-29T22:51:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: 12 üòè
[2023-10-29T22:52:00] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: No
[2023-10-29T22:53:54] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I still don't understand what's the issue?
[2023-10-29T22:54:00] haku: Do all the ant bms come with temp sensors even the 40a ones?
[2023-10-29T22:54:41] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Maybe he changed smth. I can check later if there were any changes.
[2023-10-29T22:57:10] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Weird
[2023-10-29T23:01:55] haku: This is cfork? And what kind of suspension is the laotie? Dont say trash lol
[2023-10-29T23:01:55] haku: <photos/photo_10626@29-10-2023_23-01-55.jpg>
[2023-10-29T23:02:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: I still prefer c fork of blade than laotie üòÇ
[2023-10-29T23:02:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: The quality of laotie isn‚Äôt know as the best hahaha
[2023-10-29T23:03:08] haku: Lol. But what is the laotie style called?
[2023-10-29T23:03:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: Direct fork or basically motorcycle fork
[2023-10-29T23:05:17] haku: Thank you. What is the problem with c fork? Of you dont mind me asking? I want to get a frame with that style suspension but big deck
[2023-10-29T23:20:09] Mirono escooters: Wobble at high speeds, trail varies
[2023-10-29T23:21:12] haku: Thanks
[2023-10-29T23:21:15] Pablo Fernandez: and bumps push the scooter into you with c type
[2023-10-29T23:22:06] haku: But is it more reliable than the motorcycle style?
[2023-10-29T23:23:01] haku: Cause the laotie makes me nervous even without wobbles
[2023-10-29T23:23:38] haku: I keep reading somwwhere it will crack.
[2023-10-29T23:23:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: Well, I still love C type forks honestly
[2023-10-29T23:24:07] Face de Pin Suc√©: pushing 150+Kmh on C type no problem
[2023-10-29T23:24:19] Happy Giraffe: I asked how much you want per cell?
[2023-10-29T23:24:19] Face de Pin Suc√©: and no steering damper of course
[2023-10-29T23:24:34] Pablo Fernandez: i like c type over direct fork indeed
[2023-10-29T23:24:45] haku: Thats good to know. Thank you.
[2023-10-29T23:24:54] NetworkDir: 15A i say
[2023-10-29T23:26:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: But, keep in mind that it needs good setup
[2023-10-29T23:26:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: I've seen many C type forks having bad wobble because of bad setup
[2023-10-29T23:26:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: No problem on track, but try on Italian‚Äôs road and you will understand what I mean
[2023-10-29T23:27:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: Even bikes crash everyday , think e-scooter
[2023-10-29T23:27:18] Face de Pin Suc√©: I've been in spain, it's same x)
[2023-10-29T23:27:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: Spain road are perfect , I visited Valencia and Barcellona and can‚Äôt compare with Italy
[2023-10-29T23:27:54] Pablo Fernandez: i live in a garbage road street and ctype suffers a bit, however a good suspension fix most of the issues
[2023-10-29T23:28:21] Face de Pin Suc√©: it depends were you go, if you got out of town, it's not really nice x)
[2023-10-29T23:28:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: Our tax are spent for foreign people
[2023-10-29T23:28:38] Face de Pin Suc√©: But okay, I've been in Sicilia and, I have to say, it's shit x)
[2023-10-29T23:29:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: In the city is against worse
[2023-10-29T23:29:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: Don‚Äôt recommend you to visit Rome with escooter
[2023-10-29T23:29:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs nightmare
[2023-10-29T23:29:38] Pablo Fernandez: here in sevilla spain streets are like this, so you can imagine when they dont place one of them right
[2023-10-29T23:29:44] Pablo Fernandez: it sucks riding on them
[2023-10-29T23:30:40] Pablo Fernandez: that being said, a good suspension has more impact with bumps in my experience than a fork style
[2023-10-29T23:30:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs nothing
[2023-10-29T23:30:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: Italy is like 500W and 25Kmh ?
[2023-10-29T23:30:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_10628@29-10-2023_23-30-57.jpg>
[2023-10-29T23:31:01] Paolo ‚Å≠: Look at thisüòÖ
[2023-10-29T23:31:12] Face de Pin Suc√©: Now that Spain is 1000W and 25Kmh, I won't go again in those countries
[2023-10-29T23:31:30] Pablo Fernandez: until 2027 no Watts limit but 25kmh yeah
[2023-10-29T23:31:33] Face de Pin Suc√©: we've been arested in Spain, we got lucky, but they wanted to take our scooters
[2023-10-29T23:31:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: There‚Äôs a guy who tried to replace road for free, and he got fined
[2023-10-29T23:31:53] Jan: There is no pothole if you are fast enough
[2023-10-29T23:32:07] Face de Pin Suc√©: Reading news, it says 1000W now in Spain
[2023-10-29T23:32:13] Face de Pin Suc√©: true
[2023-10-29T23:32:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_10629@29-10-2023_23-32-17.jpg>
[2023-10-29T23:32:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not if like this @AJAJ1992
[2023-10-29T23:32:34] Pablo Fernandez: yeah because you cant buy +1000w escooters in spain starting in 2024, but old ones can be used until 2027
[2023-10-29T23:32:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: If is one only maybe yes
[2023-10-29T23:32:55] Jan: Thats like one continuous pothole
[2023-10-29T23:33:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: But if are very much, you will goes inside
[2023-10-29T23:33:06] haku: The nami blast style suspension any good?
[2023-10-29T23:33:12] Pablo Fernandez: i got a fine this week because an officer thought the watts limit is already a must (500 euros)
[2023-10-29T23:33:53] Pablo Fernandez: funny enough the fine was placed while i was unconcious on the ground bleeding out (says i got notified while passed out); spanish police in a nutshell
[2023-10-29T23:38:32] haku: This one
[2023-10-29T23:39:47] Pablo Fernandez: in "theory" is better than c type for front bumps, however i havent tested it
[2023-10-29T23:39:55] Mirono escooters: Yes its better
[2023-10-29T23:40:13] Pablo Fernandez: i almost bought one to test it, but i was too lazy to change everything to 72volts
[2023-10-29T23:40:30] haku: Thanks. Safety and reliability is #1 for me
[2023-10-29T23:41:04] haku: How big is that deck compared to burnie?
[2023-10-29T23:42:53] Pablo Fernandez: <files/Nami-blast-EN-FR.pdf>
[2023-10-29T23:43:06] haku: Ty
[2023-10-29T23:43:09] Pablo Fernandez: should be there if i remember, also got burn e one
[2023-10-29T23:43:18] NetworkDir: If you want safety and reliability You should buy Segway GT2 :)
[2023-10-29T23:43:28] NetworkDir: Best frame for high speeds
[2023-10-29T23:44:10] Pablo Fernandez: not for bad roads tho
[2023-10-29T23:44:32] haku: Maybe a gt1 since gonna gut it anyway
[2023-10-29T23:44:38] NetworkDir: Sure
[2023-10-29T23:44:45] haku: Alot cheaper
[2023-10-29T23:45:29] Pablo Fernandez: btw if you want a nami a guy i know contacted michael sha to buy it with no battery and controllers (less price) in case you want to change stuff
[2023-10-29T23:45:48] haku: In the US?
[2023-10-29T23:46:03] Pablo Fernandez: because for example, the nami blast being 60v for the price is quite a joke imo. he is spanish but bought directly from michael
[2023-10-29T23:49:34] Mirono escooters: Hey guys, for alupcb 75100 V2 The 0005ohm version, not use? It's confusing? I thought alupcb only had 1 version haha
[2023-10-29T23:52:32] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_10631@29-10-2023_23-52-32.jpg>
[2023-10-29T23:52:41] Mirono escooters: 3 shunts. So just vesc default üëç
[2023-10-29T23:59:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: There‚Äôs 1 version only
[2023-10-29T23:59:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: The v2 is mean as to220 model
[2023-10-29T23:59:39] Gabe Enzo: Getting my vesc 20s done on Monday, can't wait to try out vesc power.
[2023-10-29T23:59:44] Mirono escooters: I have a 0005ohm and a default Option in vesc tab
[2023-10-29T23:59:53] Mirono escooters: But it seems like default is .. default 0005 make no sense
[2023-10-30T00:00:22] puneDir: 30a vesc wont give much power
[2023-10-30T00:00:40] Gabe Enzo: 40a Batt.
[2023-10-30T00:00:53] puneDir: Please dont say youre going to pull that
[2023-10-30T00:01:01] Gabe Enzo: Y

[2023-10-30T00:01:19] puneDir: Read datasheet
[2023-10-30T00:01:43] Mirono escooters: Huh
[2023-10-30T00:01:43] puneDir: It should be Max 30a
[2023-10-30T00:01:45] Gabe Enzo: that's 24a total. also you can go above the specsheet.
[2023-10-30T00:01:51] Gabe Enzo: You can go 40.
[2023-10-30T00:01:57] Mirono escooters: Heh, you can You can easily light your scoot on fire too
[2023-10-30T00:02:08] Gabe Enzo: also it has a temp sensor on the batt
[2023-10-30T00:02:21] puneDir: Yes but even with 30 a its hot as fuck
[2023-10-30T00:02:30] puneDir: You changed bms
[2023-10-30T00:02:41] Gabe Enzo: Installed new temp diode.
[2023-10-30T00:02:56] puneDir: Also that motor will die with 40a
[2023-10-30T00:03:03] puneDir: In one min
[2023-10-30T00:03:18] Gabe Enzo: I'll use less then
[2023-10-30T00:03:44] Gabe Enzo: 20a batt already makes you go 75.
[2023-10-30T00:03:54] Gabe Enzo: Less. 10a.
[2023-10-30T00:04:16] Mirono escooters: What
[2023-10-30T00:04:30] Gabe Enzo: Ya eco mode 7a + fw 7a

[2023-10-30T00:04:46] Gabe Enzo: that's 7a phase
[2023-10-30T00:04:53] Gabe Enzo: I'm pretty sure with scooter hacking utility's
[2023-10-30T00:04:56] puneDir: are you 50kg

[2023-10-30T00:06:15] Gabe Enzo: that's 1500w you know
[2023-10-30T00:06:17] puneDir: With 30a (g30 g1 dual) with 2x xiaomi batteries took me to 63 max
[2023-10-30T00:06:25] puneDir: Im 90
[2023-10-30T00:06:31] Mirono escooters: Electron, 7a+7a fw isn't taking you to 60kmh Sincerely Everyone
[2023-10-30T00:06:49] puneDir: My 60kg friend maded 75 with same setup
[2023-10-30T00:06:50] Gabe Enzo: You weigh 1/3 more than me and went a bit slower. just proves if I was on your scooter Id go flying

[2023-10-30T00:07:00] puneDir: yes but
[2023-10-30T00:07:06] puneDir: 20a and 30a is so much different

[2023-10-30T00:07:33] Gabe Enzo: maybe im wrong
[2023-10-30T00:07:46] puneDir: Also going 63 and 75 is so different
[2023-10-30T00:07:57] puneDir: You nearly need 1.5x more power
[2023-10-30T00:08:07] Gabe Enzo: It's because warp speed comes at 70kmh
[2023-10-30T00:08:14] Gabe Enzo: warp 9 star trek
[2023-10-30T00:08:32] puneDir: that wind resistance and stuff
[2023-10-30T00:08:36] Gabe Enzo: I can push 2880w peak with that batt
[2023-10-30T00:08:45] puneDir: yes but u fuck battery

[2023-10-30T00:09:29] Happy Giraffe: That cell max ~8A continuous without heat protection
[2023-10-30T00:15:20] Face de Pin Suc√©: It is shit as fuck
[2023-10-30T00:15:42] Face de Pin Suc√©: This kind of forks are perfect to do faceplants
[2023-10-30T00:16:21] Face de Pin Suc√©: It's same design as all weped fold serie
[2023-10-30T00:16:25] Face de Pin Suc√©: And it's shit
[2023-10-30T00:16:42] Mirono escooters: Oh
[2023-10-30T00:16:57] haku: Oh dang. Thank you
[2023-10-30T00:17:07] Pablo Fernandez: oh really had no idea. never had the chance to test it
[2023-10-30T00:17:30] Face de Pin Suc√©: Just look at the movement
[2023-10-30T00:18:02] Face de Pin Suc√©: <photos/photo_10632@30-10-2023_00-18-02.jpg>
[2023-10-30T00:18:12] Face de Pin Suc√©: This is the movement when pushing front brake
[2023-10-30T00:18:17] haku: I guess c type is proven. It just depends on who makes it
[2023-10-30T00:18:44] Face de Pin Suc√©: The rear gets released, you can easily go into unwanted drift for example
[2023-10-30T00:18:49] Pablo Fernandez: actually true, never thought about braking force with it
[2023-10-30T00:19:07] Face de Pin Suc√©: In case of emergency you can be pushed on the front very easily and then faceplant
[2023-10-30T00:19:19] Face de Pin Suc√©: When they showed the first Weped Fold, that's the first thing I saw
[2023-10-30T00:19:44] Gabe Enzo: Yup
[2023-10-30T00:19:55] Gabe Enzo: Is there anything good lmfso
[2023-10-30T00:19:55] Mirono escooters: Concept good Physics not
[2023-10-30T00:20:09] Face de Pin Suc√©: And a guy here in Lyon, experienced that problem, something braked on his front wheel, and he immediately fly and broke his arm üòÇ
[2023-10-30T00:20:15] Gabe Enzo: I realized what was wrong with it with no context that's how shit it looks like
[2023-10-30T00:20:33] haku: Ill just reinforce my laotie dropouts to be sure lol
[2023-10-30T00:21:05] Mirono escooters: Waw
[2023-10-30T00:21:12] Mirono escooters: Sad
[2023-10-30T00:21:22] Pablo Fernandez: i mean keep in mind escooters are not a good design just as a machine itself
[2023-10-30T00:21:28] Pablo Fernandez: so easy to find cons on everything
[2023-10-30T00:22:57] Mirono escooters: Gt2 ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2023-10-30T00:23:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: A tank
[2023-10-30T00:24:05] Face de Pin Suc√©: <photos/photo_10633@30-10-2023_00-24-05.jpg>
[2023-10-30T00:24:05] Mirono escooters: Yess
[2023-10-30T00:24:11] Mirono escooters: But so pricey. I don't want to spend that much
[2023-10-30T00:24:18] Face de Pin Suc√©: It is quite nice to be able to look at your printing
[2023-10-30T00:25:00] Face de Pin Suc√©: Now what I remember from GT2 is that tube in the direction with motor wires, such a weakness ...
[2023-10-30T00:25:48] Mirono escooters: Yes, that sucks
[2023-10-30T00:26:09] Mirono escooters: I usually get up and look with me eyes üëÄ
[2023-10-30T00:27:05] Happy Giraffe: I talked shit
[2023-10-30T00:27:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes, but I'm in my bed, and just launched a print of design I just finished on the 3D printer in my workplace
[2023-10-30T00:27:18] Mirono escooters: Haha, yes is nice
[2023-10-30T00:27:50] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_10634@30-10-2023_00-27-50.jpg>
[2023-10-30T00:28:11] Mirono escooters: It takes Soo long
[2023-10-30T00:28:27] Happy Giraffe: 10A not recommended but maybe 8A is fine for continuous
[2023-10-30T00:29:03] Mirono escooters: Pot with dielectric epoxy Fixed
[2023-10-30T00:29:18] Pablo Fernandez: if i have to rewire a stem again im gonna duct tape all the wires in the outside lol
[2023-10-30T00:29:24] Happy Giraffe: Nkon doesnt sell

[2023-10-30T00:34:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Capacity "sounds" nice ,but cells not happy at higher amps
[2023-10-30T00:35:05] Mirono escooters: It's nice capacity
[2023-10-30T00:35:12] Mirono escooters: I will have highest energy density Ninebot xD

[2023-10-30T00:38:38] Mirono escooters: Only good thing on that scoot frame
[2023-10-30T00:38:52] Mirono escooters: The suspension was gone, frame was debatable
[2023-10-30T00:39:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: All was took to parts
[2023-10-30T00:39:19] Mirono escooters: Good
[2023-10-30T00:40:17] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Redone reversed konyk with other engine and some custom cnc shit, than owner riped konyk arm ü§£
[2023-10-30T00:40:40] Happy Giraffe: M50LT seems to be unable to provide 15A for more than bursts I cant open Mooch test, site has some errors..üò≠

[2023-10-30T00:44:54] Happy Giraffe: Gives 30A per wheel and nice rangeüòÅ
[2023-10-30T00:45:08] Mirono escooters: How? Crazy thick metal

[2023-10-30T00:54:31] Mirono escooters: Ah
[2023-10-30T01:04:41] Happy Giraffe: Cells totally raped after that
[2023-10-30T01:16:13] Happy Giraffe: Then it's no issueüòÅ
[2023-10-30T01:16:57] Happy Giraffe: I run my 35E 13s6p at 40A total so each cell only gets below 7AüòÇ very conservative numbers
[2023-10-30T01:18:33] KierreKikkeli: Im assuming those odd hairs are from the bearings or what is that?
[2023-10-30T01:18:51] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_10637@30-10-2023_01-18-51.jpg>

[2023-10-30T01:25:17] Pablo Fernandez: his first beard, they grow so fast

[2023-10-30T01:42:12] Happy Giraffe: Needs cable-axle spacer
[2023-10-30T01:42:44] Happy Giraffe: If bms was more than 35A and thicker nickel then surely would do 50AüòÅ
[2023-10-30T01:43:00] KierreKikkeli: Not sure how as the cable comes out of the axel xd
[2023-10-30T01:43:29] Happy Giraffe: Then you get extra space to bend it nicely
[2023-10-30T01:43:39] KierreKikkeli: Fair
[2023-10-30T01:44:01] KierreKikkeli: Need to swap the bearings anyways so might as well do it at the same time
[2023-10-30T01:44:35] KierreKikkeli: Or just ziptie the cable on the suspension frame from the beginning part xd
[2023-10-30T01:45:15] KierreKikkeli: Nvm that wont help me need a spacer -.-, edit that wont help either coz of the axle design -.-
[2023-10-30T02:00:32] haku: Isnt p42 45a peak?
[2023-10-30T02:02:41] Jan: 45a easy
[2023-10-30T02:07:07] Happy Giraffe: Yeah but not recommended for long timeüòÅ It has higher internal resistance than 45B
[2023-10-30T02:09:51] Jan: What do you define long time?
[2023-10-30T02:13:10] haku: Batteey mooch lectured me abour that too. I think for scooters you can get away with 45a for 5 sec
[2023-10-30T02:14:52] haku: 15mohm i think is the resistance. Should be able to take short bursts
[2023-10-30T02:32:11] Jan: I count 60seconds already as long time, as you draw that current for 8seconds, you will be already going 100kph+. How more do you want to send it... cruising speeds push way less amps
[2023-10-30T02:33:27] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I go sometimes riding in the forest area with ton of hills etc so will pull quite a lot. Long city cruising not so much
[2023-10-30T02:34:42] Happy Giraffe: Would be interesting if someone tested cell life with 20 second bursts at high amps vs stable lower amps
[2023-10-30T02:34:43] Jan: Yeah but on a small 6p battery, thats pushing 240a+ => 14-20kW
[2023-10-30T02:35:06] Jan: Never ever that power for a forest
[2023-10-30T02:35:11] Jan: Maybe 5kW
[2023-10-30T02:35:21] Jan: And thats already plenty for lose ground
[2023-10-30T02:35:42] Jan: I think you are safe with those cells
[2023-10-30T02:35:51] Happy Giraffe: Friend has a mid drive currently that likes power, 10kw its just flying aroundüòÅ
[2023-10-30T02:36:38] Happy Giraffe: DH frames cant take much more than that sadly
[2023-10-30T02:36:46] Jan: You would need to constantly send it at 15+kW and thats only 6p. Offroad scooters are heavier and larger so you would pack even bigger batteries
[2023-10-30T02:37:33] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, Im on the ebike side nowadays. But I agree people wont do so long bursts on scooters typically
[2023-10-30T02:37:58] Happy Giraffe: Deck space also nice there. Its a hassle with dual suspension bikes
[2023-10-30T02:44:56] Happy Giraffe: I would love to experience the real 23hp 320Nm benced that a guy on my hometown didüòÇ QS273 customized bearebike (then cyklon)
[2023-10-30T02:45:29] Happy Giraffe: Cant hold front wheel down and would theoretically go 0-100 3-4secüòÖ
[2023-10-30T03:03:58] haku: With a proper bms should be no problem. Battery mooch i think tests his cells per peice not in a pack with bms. Im not sure though
[2023-10-30T04:15:15] haku: Did anyone try to use lipo on your scooters?
[2023-10-30T05:42:06] Happy Giraffe: It's single cellsüëç
[2023-10-30T07:14:11] Happy Giraffe: Some snow riding. Really like new ubox temps

[2023-10-30T08:02:28] Happy Giraffe: Shit value, why dont you get 50E from Nkon?
[2023-10-30T08:02:44] NetworkDir: Because I can‚Äôt purchase from nkon
[2023-10-30T08:02:55] NetworkDir: Turkiye customs deny any batterys

[2023-10-30T21:15:51] Mirono escooters: James too
[2023-10-30T21:15:53] Mirono escooters: He can better explain but
[2023-10-30T21:16:07] Mirono escooters: The ADC voltage of throttle is floating at 1.5v Brake is working fine
[2023-10-30T21:16:23] Mirono escooters: ADC voltage goes from 1.5v to 1.5v But it reacts to throttle super slightly. XD
[2023-10-30T21:16:31] Mirono escooters: 1.48v to 1.5 actually Doesn't matter, not overriding
[2023-10-30T21:35:24] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Gen1 g30 motor

[2023-10-30T21:37:03] Mirono escooters: I'll retest later
[2023-10-30T21:37:20] Mirono escooters: But as we know, comparing different vesc versions doesn't work
[2023-10-30T21:37:31] Mirono escooters: Updating vesc changes motor detection values
[2023-10-30T21:37:41] Mirono escooters: Was weird
[2023-10-30T21:37:47] Mirono escooters: I'll redo later, we will see

[2023-10-30T21:41:12] Rogerio Figueiredo: In mu opinion since vesc has fw motor with better torque are better
[2023-10-30T21:41:22] Mirono escooters: Fw is very wasteful
[2023-10-30T21:41:36] Mirono escooters: Just get a motor and batt setup that suits your needs There is no "better"
[2023-10-30T21:43:08] Rogerio Figueiredo: I don't have same opinion
[2023-10-30T21:43:31] Rogerio Figueiredo: I do top speed like one time so fw helps there
[2023-10-30T21:43:46] sombre_enfant: Then dont ask
[2023-10-30T21:44:15] Rogerio Figueiredo: In normal day use thsy match speed
[2023-10-30T21:44:20] Rogerio Figueiredo: Why not?
[2023-10-30T21:45:30] Mirono escooters: For once ok Daily useless
[2023-10-30T21:45:56] puneDir: Fwk?
[2023-10-30T21:46:19] puneDir: I love fwk
[2023-10-30T21:46:26] puneDir: Cuz g30 g1
[2023-10-30T21:46:36] Mirono escooters: :(
[2023-10-30T21:47:55] KierreKikkeli: don think its hair, i do have long hair tho, but these were thicker and covered in oil coming from the inside themselfs + the bearings sound like dying so assumed it might be coming from them
[2023-10-30T21:49:42] KierreKikkeli: also if they were my hairs there would be a fck ton more of em as mine are almost down to my ass
[2023-10-30T21:54:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: It's hair ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇüòÖüôà
[2023-10-30T22:12:50] haku: That looks like a net or fishing line
[2023-10-30T22:14:41] haku: Sorry for the noob question. But what is wrong here?
[2023-10-30T22:16:21] Mirono escooters: Nothing, just showing values
[2023-10-30T22:19:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Its for some garden purposes ,just was showing any similar gets stuck like hair
[2023-10-30T22:40:02] KierreKikkeli: fished out some o ring pieces from there aswell, might be some random hairs but they are more or less as a bundle like on the front wheel xd
[2023-10-30T22:43:03] KierreKikkeli: The damaged ring part shown in the video seems to support the not hair option
[2023-10-30T22:46:55] KierreKikkeli: after washing some of em it seems to be hair mixed in with oil and o ring/rubber particles
[2023-10-30T22:56:21] haku: @Mirono_escooters do you know if you can limit peak current on an ant bms. For example if its rated for 320 peak can you limit it to 300?
[2023-10-30T22:56:31] Mirono escooters: Yes, ofcourse
[2023-10-30T22:56:34] Mirono escooters: It's all customisable
[2023-10-30T22:56:46] Mirono escooters: You can even set the ns/ms delay for overcurrent
[2023-10-30T22:56:46] haku: Got it. Thank you
[2023-10-30T22:57:12] haku: Thats amazing
[2023-10-30T22:57:16] Mirono escooters: : D
[2023-10-30T23:03:39] KierreKikkeli: question regarding the vsett 10+ replacement bearings, can i buy some random cheap bicycle bearings or should i invest on snowmobile bearings, as those 2 seem to be the most common uses here for 6004-2RS and 6202-2RS
[2023-10-30T23:04:24] Mirono escooters: 2rs
[2023-10-30T23:04:33] Mirono escooters: Preferably skf
[2023-10-30T23:04:40] NetworkDir: Wait
[2023-10-30T23:04:50] NetworkDir: Zero 10x and more clones bearing's 2x 6202-2rsh 2x 6003-2rsh
[2023-10-30T23:04:57] NetworkDir: Should this ones
[2023-10-30T23:05:03] NetworkDir: Skf nice
[2023-10-30T23:05:12] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_10647@30-10-2023_23-05-12.jpg>
[2023-10-30T23:05:28] NetworkDir: Hmm maybe
[2023-10-30T23:05:33] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_10648@30-10-2023_23-05-33.jpg>
[2023-10-30T23:05:38] KierreKikkeli: from a stor selling em
[2023-10-30T23:05:46] Mirono escooters: Doesn't matter. What a detail
[2023-10-30T23:05:48] Mirono escooters: Maybe 10w xd
[2023-10-30T23:06:14] Mirono escooters: Bweh
[2023-10-30T23:06:21] Mirono escooters: Pump ur tires and it's fine
[2023-10-30T23:07:00] KierreKikkeli: ill take the less resistant ones coz i do coasting and need to have less tyre pressure for winter
[2023-10-30T23:07:12] Mirono escooters: Bruh
[2023-10-30T23:07:23] Mirono escooters: Then they'll be destroyed immediately in winter weather if not 2rs
[2023-10-30T23:07:38] KierreKikkeli: eh, the essential stock ones going strong after 2 years
[2023-10-30T23:07:47] Mirono escooters: :( you do you
[2023-10-30T23:07:51] KierreKikkeli: on motor and the normal one
[2023-10-30T23:08:02] NetworkDir: For me 6003 at zero :/
[2023-10-30T23:08:09] KierreKikkeli: also if they sell 2rs's for snowmobile use im quite sure theyll be fine on a scooter xd
[2023-10-30T23:08:32] Mirono escooters: I'm literally saying get 2rs lol
[2023-10-30T23:08:50] haku: Can you buy authentic skf bearings on ali?
[2023-10-30T23:08:53] KierreKikkeli: ah yea that was the plan
[2023-10-30T23:09:06] NetworkDir: I think no
[2023-10-30T23:09:07] KierreKikkeli: my bad
[2023-10-30T23:09:11] NetworkDir: But you can find anywhere
[2023-10-30T23:09:27] NetworkDir: Skf is populer brand
[2023-10-30T23:09:27] haku: Dang. I was looking at a set on ali
[2023-10-30T23:09:37] Mirono escooters: Defenitely do not cheap on bearings
[2023-10-30T23:09:39] NetworkDir: Local tool stores
[2023-10-30T23:09:44] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_10649@30-10-2023_23-09-44.jpg>
[2023-10-30T23:10:04] KierreKikkeli: those are marketed for bicycles but i guess its the same as in scoots
[2023-10-30T23:10:37] haku: Gotcha. I will ask a bike shop. There is a trek shop near me
[2023-10-30T23:11:36] Mirono escooters: Bearing is bearing
[2023-10-30T23:11:47] KierreKikkeli: yea, i was planning on going for "premium" bearings as i dont want a repeat of what happened with my moped 10 years ago (bearing snapped in half and tyre went on a 90degree angle at 80kmh towards a river)
[2023-10-30T23:11:59] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_10650@30-10-2023_23-11-59.jpg>
[2023-10-30T23:11:59] haku: Funny i bought an ali bearings for my g30 that im trying to repair
[2023-10-30T23:12:20] KierreKikkeli: that was the day i learnt bearing quality matters xd
[2023-10-30T23:12:26] Mirono escooters: Rsh on scoot why
[2023-10-30T23:12:38] NetworkDir: I bought all for 15$ xD 6month ago
[2023-10-30T23:12:51] KierreKikkeli: <photos/photo_10651@30-10-2023_23-12-51.jpg>
[2023-10-30T23:13:09] Mirono escooters: Weird.
[2023-10-30T23:13:10] KierreKikkeli: ah
[2023-10-30T23:13:15] Mirono escooters: Free upgrade
[2023-10-30T23:14:21] KierreKikkeli: the bearing that snapped was the "derbi" stock one and i went to get a new "premium" one from a literal local bearings shop
[2023-10-30T23:14:29] haku: Previous owner rode this front wheel with 1 bearing and other messed up one on g30
[2023-10-30T23:14:36] Mirono escooters: How tf
[2023-10-30T23:14:48] NetworkDir: Wtf
[2023-10-30T23:14:52] NetworkDir: <sticker>
[2023-10-30T23:15:07] haku: I know dude. I dont know if i should just buy a new rim
[2023-10-30T23:15:49] haku: But i will make it run.
[2023-10-30T23:20:52] KierreKikkeli: i should also replace the front rims bearings but eh, ill just get a bigger rim when i can, planning on a 10 x 3 front tyre so it matches the vsett
[2023-10-30T23:24:20] haku: Skf bearings are US made yea?
[2023-10-30T23:24:30] Mirono escooters: Indian i think, hahz
[2023-10-30T23:24:34] Mirono escooters: My big machinery ones are
[2023-10-30T23:26:11] haku: I see. Gonna try to look for authentic ones here. Most stuff on amazon are just ali stuff with bezos tax.
[2023-10-30T23:26:26] S1m 0n: Italy its print on
[2023-10-30T23:26:57] Mirono escooters: Mine indian
[2023-10-30T23:27:41] haku: Aslong as they are authentic and built with high standards. You are right do not cheap out on bearings
[2023-10-30T23:43:37] cihan: They're mostly made in India as I read but is the brand sold? I didn't read it.
[2023-10-30T23:45:08] Mirono escooters: Skf is quality
[2023-10-30T23:56:31] haku: I searched youtube university.
[2023-10-30T23:57:42] haku: I forgot i took a photo of this before
[2023-10-30T23:57:52] Mirono escooters: Isnt skf Italy brand But produced now everywhere
[2023-10-30T23:59:24] haku: maybe because of demand
[2023-10-30T23:59:38] Mirono escooters: Problably
[2023-10-31T00:02:40] cihan: It's Swedish by origin. It's still Swedish as I know. Manufacturing something in Sweden is too expensive probably unless it's worth and high tech.
[2023-10-31T00:03:12] Mirono escooters: Oh
[2023-10-31T00:03:17] Mirono escooters: Yes, expensive
[2023-10-31T00:08:45] haku: Vedder is swedish?
[2023-10-31T00:09:17] haku: I though he was american
[2023-10-31T00:09:27] cihan: I just learned √ñhlins and reading great reviews.
[2023-10-31T00:10:01] haku: Or german
[2023-10-31T00:12:33] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-10-31T00:13:15] haku: Good to know!
[2023-10-31T00:13:58] haku: I will visit sweden someday!
[2023-10-31T00:14:20] haku: Beautiful scenery
[2023-10-31T00:16:10] Mirono escooters: I will move to there someday
[2023-10-31T00:16:12] Mirono escooters: I love it
[2023-10-31T00:45:27] haku: If i had full custody of my son i would move there. I think it will be a problem raising my boy here. But anyways its cool that vesc is developed there
[2023-10-31T01:08:59] Happy Giraffe: Shut up big brother, you only have surstr√∂mming
[2023-10-31T01:09:54] Happy Giraffe: We need more cool tech in the west. Not just US/Asia
[2023-10-31T01:45:44] Ion: I always see the craziest shit with used g30 scooters
[2023-10-31T01:46:17] Ion: Like this fork from a "fully working" scooter
[2023-10-31T02:07:49] haku: How does that even happen lol
[2023-10-31T02:08:25] Ion: Previous owner hit something, I think...
[2023-10-31T02:08:59] haku: Dang
[2023-10-31T02:09:50] haku: Good thing g30 has lots of parts
[2023-10-31T02:28:05] Pablo Fernandez: Yeah an angle grinder
[2023-10-31T02:53:59] haku: Those are for the forks. I dont think you can access that on an angle grinder
[2023-10-31T02:54:24] haku: Its hidden inside the neck
[2023-10-31T04:04:43] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: man
[2023-10-31T04:05:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I hate dealing with 6.05 all the time
[2023-10-31T04:05:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: vedderb always breaks stuff :(
[2023-10-31T04:08:11] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: If you don't mind, please report the issue on the VESC GitHub repository yourself. I can't always test on my daily scooter just because a newer beta breaks something
[2023-10-31T04:13:45] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and if you need it to work now, use the Beta 15, which I am using rn
[2023-10-31T04:27:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/commit/2a783d6e5f6f707ee09675160dc17090f5fdcfef I might have found what broke it. Before the detached pwr value was being mapped by the code above, but since this commit it was now moved below the mapping process.
[2023-10-31T04:27:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: And I guess this breaks it.
[2023-10-31T04:29:15] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes :) I will push a fix for this myself. I will try it on my main scooter, should be safe enough to try after I now found the issue with VESC code.
[2023-10-31T04:30:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I just woke up
[2023-10-31T04:31:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I have to... today last day of Holiday :(
[2023-10-31T04:31:19] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: and the past days I was sleeping at day and staying awake at night
[2023-10-31T04:31:30] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: But yesterday I just stayed awake for 2 days and now fixed
[2023-10-31T04:36:25] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Yes that would be really bad... üò¨
[2023-10-31T04:52:57] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I did push the fix, but eh probably dont want to bother testing it out on my scooter. If you tell me what firmware hw config you need, it I can compile it, would be nice if you could try it. @jamessoderstrom @Mirono_escooters
[2023-10-31T04:53:22] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: https://github.com/vedderb/bldc/pull/669
[2023-10-31T04:53:42] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: üëç
[2023-10-31T08:40:09] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: seems it was actually somewhat intended, but he forgot about ADC2. But still, that would fucking suck
[2023-10-31T08:40:29] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I hope he realizes it from what I say. Thats literally the biggest benefit of using the ADC app
[2023-10-31T08:54:30] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: :)
[2023-10-31T09:08:33] Happy Giraffe: Fingers crossed, using xiaomu screen on a bike with printed mount could also be fun
[2023-10-31T09:34:42] Mirono escooters: Then it works?
[2023-10-31T09:35:18] Mirono escooters: Me reading this:
[2023-10-31T09:35:50] Mirono escooters: <video_file>
[2023-10-31T09:37:19] Mirono escooters: Can I just reflash the vesc now, and it's fixed?,
[2023-10-31T09:37:25] Mirono escooters: I'm on 75100 V2 6.05
[2023-10-31T09:46:09] Mirono escooters: Sorry, for noob question. If its merged, i can just reflash it, and it'll be integrated, right?
[2023-10-31T09:46:11] Mirono escooters: Using 6.05 beta
[2023-10-31T09:46:44] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: When its merged, it should be included in the newest VESC Tool. But check the date. I cannot tell.
[2023-10-31T09:47:18] Mirono escooters: I'll have a go, and otherwise ping you ;)
[2023-10-31T09:50:20] Unknown: I have 75200 makerbase on 5.2 does a firmware upgrade change praformnce for the better ?
[2023-10-31T09:50:31] Mirono escooters: You are a few versions behind
[2023-10-31T09:50:44] Mirono escooters: Depends if you need the new features, but upgrading to 6.02 is always a good idea
[2023-10-31T09:50:47] Unknown: A "few"
[2023-10-31T09:51:07] Unknown: Better acceleration? Fw ?
[2023-10-31T09:51:22] Mirono escooters: Don't expect better accel
[2023-10-31T09:51:29] Mirono escooters: We have lisp now And fw yeah
[2023-10-31T09:51:44] Unknown: What is lisp
[2023-10-31T09:52:00] Mirono escooters: Some coding thing
[2023-10-31T09:52:05] Mirono escooters: Something cool : D
[2023-10-31T09:54:14] Unknown: How can it help me ? Smother ? Faster ?
[2023-10-31T09:54:44] Mirono escooters: No, programming custom features
[2023-10-31T09:54:49] Unknown: Also I'm thinking about using 100a on moter amps to get better acceleration
[2023-10-31T09:54:57] Unknown: No need I think
[2023-10-31T09:55:00] Mirono escooters: 100a phase Should be fine Wich motor
[2023-10-31T09:55:07] Unknown: Zero10x
[2023-10-31T09:55:13] Unknown: 1200 I think
[2023-10-31T09:55:14] Mirono escooters: Should do it
[2023-10-31T09:56:01] Unknown: Acceleration is wired because it's only pickes up after 20-30kmh
[2023-10-31T09:57:33] Unknown: Filed weakening Is for faster speeds on the top end no ?
[2023-10-31T10:00:07] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-10-31T10:02:22] Unknown: So I'm stuck with no acceleration of the line
[2023-10-31T10:03:13] Mirono escooters: up phase amps
[2023-10-31T10:03:33] Gabe Enzo: @kawaiinekololis why is the capacitor optional.
[2023-10-31T10:04:01] Mirono escooters: Use a cap on 5v if you use a Sketchy Esc like flipsky/makerbase
[2023-10-31T10:04:09] Mirono escooters: 3.3v cap makes no sense
[2023-10-31T10:04:26] Mirono escooters: That's what i did. Ususally should be plenty on board already

[2023-10-31T16:05:37] Gabe Enzo: what's this lol
[2023-10-31T16:08:00] Mirono escooters: That you are on 6.05 beta

[2023-10-31T18:26:51] Mirono escooters: I do not know
[2023-10-31T18:27:16] Unknown: When you are in trauma you don't really think right and reasonable you're just afraid

[2023-10-31T18:29:44] Mirono escooters: Yeh, agree, I didnt know how to word it xd
[2023-10-31T18:30:20] francois schempers: of course, this is a Vesc help group, discussions must revolve around that, or it's the start of anarchy, no political, no war, no religious content, from any side, we don't take side
[2023-10-31T18:31:46] francois schempers: expensive but there is no real contender, it's the only cell that doesn't Vdrop badly at that load

[2023-10-31T21:33:28] Happy Giraffe: Always has workedüò≥
[2023-10-31T21:34:13] Happy Giraffe: Funny how reset actually resetsüòÇ
[2023-10-31T21:42:58] Happy Giraffe: I remember now it gave me shit once but not that oftenü§î
[2023-10-31T21:47:58] sombre_enfant: It work
[2023-10-31T21:48:37] haku: ty
[2023-10-31T22:03:10] Happy Giraffe: Yeah idk what changes have thrown off the measurements
[2023-10-31T22:03:22] Happy Giraffe: 5.3 was perfect
[2023-10-31T23:09:38] KierreKikkeli: Prob stolen like they tried with sauna üòÇ
[2023-10-31T23:13:26] KierreKikkeli: The mapping input is also bugged, have to input the voltages manually if using stock xiaomi stuff or otherwise the brake lever itself works as reverse gas and brake
[2023-10-31T23:15:25] KierreKikkeli: 0.86v - 3.6v for throttle and 0.50v -1.14v for brake -.- , by default recognition it slaps the throttle starting voltage at 0.00 which results in weirdness
[2023-10-31T23:40:11] francois schempers: did you set the throttle to Current no reverse brake adc2 ?
[2023-10-31T23:40:25] KierreKikkeli: Doesnt matter what u set it to
[2023-10-31T23:41:12] KierreKikkeli: It fucks up the initial voltages, ive tried every option and only working one is to set em manually correctly on pc xd
[2023-10-31T23:44:55] Mirono escooters: Uhu my stock mapping was off too
[2023-10-31T23:45:58] KierreKikkeli: Ye, it seems to get confused with the e brake/ another throttle input which results in the initial first one getting fucked
[2023-10-31T23:46:54] KierreKikkeli: If i only move the throttle and leave the brake alone it maps correctly, but if i touch the brake the throttles starting input is set to value of 0.35 aka 0.00v
[2023-11-01T00:11:57] KierreKikkeli: Does the adc v2 do that?
[2023-11-01T00:24:51] Happy Giraffe: I never had that problemü§î maybe because I always used separate 5v gnd
[2023-11-01T00:31:16] haku: is there an electronic kill switch for vesc? my scooter doesnt have any. just an on and off button.
[2023-11-01T00:52:05] Gabe Enzo: Right
[2023-11-01T00:52:24] Gabe Enzo: I don't
[2023-11-01T01:16:28] Mirono escooters: On off is pretty kill switch
[2023-11-01T01:16:48] Mirono escooters: You can wire your smart bms to have one Or interrupt power to throttle?
[2023-11-01T01:41:12] haku: i dont have a smart bms on my stock battery right now unfortunately. i was hoping these is some electronic bluetooth device to turn off power to vesc.
[2023-11-01T01:44:43] haku: yes. spintend. i have the power botton wired but i want something that can turn off power. maybe i will wire a key ignition. right now anyone can just turn on my scooter and run off with it
[2023-11-01T01:46:33] haku: ok. thanks. vesc doesnt have that option to turn off esc without cutting power?
[2023-11-01T01:46:39] Mirono escooters: Huh
[2023-11-01T01:46:49] Mirono escooters: Disable throttle is your easiest bet?
[2023-11-01T01:46:56] Mirono escooters: Or just use a key to turn it on. Way easier
[2023-11-01T01:47:40] haku: okay. thanks. i was hoping its on vesc tool to turn it off
[2023-11-01T01:48:10] haku: on vesc tool
[2023-11-01T01:48:29] haku: nvm. i will get a key
[2023-11-01T01:49:04] haku: yes something like an electronic kill switch. not a physical switch
[2023-11-01T01:49:31] Mirono escooters: Just, set phase amps to 0
[2023-11-01T01:49:32] haku: so i can turn it off on my phone
[2023-11-01T01:49:32] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2023-11-01T01:50:01] haku: i really dont like having keys with me.
[2023-11-01T01:50:07] Mirono escooters: And brake to max, like on Xiaomi lock
[2023-11-01T01:50:13] Mirono escooters: People will just run off with it
[2023-11-01T01:50:14] haku: gotcha
[2023-11-01T01:50:19] Mirono escooters: Takes 10s to load into a cargo van
[2023-11-01T01:50:40] Mirono escooters: Electronic locks are stupid imo but eh
[2023-11-01T01:51:00] haku: crime in my area not to bad though. the kids is what im woried about maybe messing with it and get hurt
[2023-11-01T01:51:26] Mirono escooters: Still.. even a small physical lock
[2023-11-01T01:51:28] Mirono escooters: Number combo
[2023-11-01T01:51:40] haku: üëå
[2023-11-01T01:52:18] haku: thanks everyone
[2023-11-01T01:53:35] haku: like a nfc card reader maybe. connected to my android phone
[2023-11-01T01:55:05] Mirono escooters: Like the vsett?
[2023-11-01T01:55:08] Mirono escooters: Is cool
[2023-11-01T01:55:16] haku: exactly like vsett
[2023-11-01T01:55:28] Mirono escooters: I don't even know if the NFC tag works with vesc yet.. the dash works. Ak made it work. Check his GitHub
[2023-11-01T01:55:44] Mirono escooters: Would be cool Id problably get the vsett dash for my bomber
[2023-11-01T01:56:16] haku: yea man. so much you can do with these pevs.
[2023-11-01T01:58:21] Mirono escooters: Just sad police a bunch of pigs'
[2023-11-01T02:00:35] haku: are they strict about pevs there?
[2023-11-01T02:00:57] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-11-01T02:01:08] Mirono escooters: And not enough private land to cruise on so
[2023-11-01T02:02:35] haku: thats good to know
[2023-11-01T02:03:04] Mirono escooters: Wayo
[2023-11-01T02:03:23] Mirono escooters: Lisp is great
[2023-11-01T02:08:25] Mirono escooters: Nice dash too
[2023-11-01T02:08:31] Mirono escooters: I'd put it on my bomber
[2023-11-01T02:10:52] haku: what hidden speed modes?
[2023-11-01T02:11:18] haku: nice.
[2023-11-01T02:12:14] Mirono escooters: Even the g30 one they wont find out
[2023-11-01T02:12:15] haku: maybe i will remove mine and put it on laotie. thay sounds awsome. im just not a programer
[2023-11-01T02:42:22] haku: what a joke company
[2023-11-01T02:43:59] haku: 1st time this happened to me in alibaba
[2023-11-01T02:45:20] haku: never delivered my bomber i ordered
[2023-11-01T02:45:48] haku: its just sitting in a warehouse in LA
[2023-11-01T02:46:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: Did they at least answer you?
[2023-11-01T02:46:15] Paolo ‚Å≠: The seller of my friend don‚Äôt even reply Xd
[2023-11-01T02:47:58] haku: yes they replied but trade assurance made them. and trade assurance is siding with them too. good thing i paid thru paypal
[2023-11-01T02:48:38] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not always
[2023-11-01T02:48:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: But yes PayPal best
[2023-11-01T02:49:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: A e-scooter factory got scammed from buyer for amount of 12.000$
[2023-11-01T02:49:39] haku: <photos/photo_10664@31-10-2023_18-40-28.jpg>
[2023-11-01T02:50:14] haku: got my money exept for the alarm lol
[2023-11-01T02:50:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: He paid order, after they processed the train shipment , and the tracking wasn‚Äôt still available, buyer opened dispute and alibaba refund everything even the shipment was still on the way
[2023-11-01T02:50:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: And obviously he didn‚Äôt return money to the factory
[2023-11-01T02:50:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: And scooter too
[2023-11-01T02:50:49] haku: dam
[2023-11-01T02:51:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Can‚Äôt tell u , unfortunately is their confidential info
[2023-11-01T02:51:36] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes it was already on the way
[2023-11-01T02:53:11] haku: mine actually was shipped to US warehouse but they were having problems with delivery
[2023-11-01T02:53:48] haku: it was sitting there for 2 momths
[2023-11-01T02:55:29] haku: 12k dollars?
[2023-11-01T03:07:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2023-11-01T03:08:14] haku: thats awful
[2023-11-01T03:31:04] haku: i dont even want to bother with paypal with that alarm. please avoid this company folks. ive been nothing but nice and polite to them and took advantage of that.
[2023-11-01T03:33:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: U got bike refund through PayPal or alibaba?
[2023-11-01T03:34:04] haku: paypal.
[2023-11-01T03:34:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: Alibaba didn‚Äôt accepted?
[2023-11-01T03:34:24] haku: alibaba cancelled the refund soon as i talked to my bank
[2023-11-01T03:34:39] haku: closed the case imediately
[2023-11-01T03:35:41] haku: trade assurance is pretty scummy tbh. so unproffessional
[2023-11-01T03:35:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: U are platinum user? Maybe they see also this
[2023-11-01T03:36:09] haku: not platinum
[2023-11-01T03:36:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because normally AliExpress / alibaba is famous because how people scam seller and no contrary ahahah
[2023-11-01T03:37:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: But yes alibaba is a bit different than aliexprsss
[2023-11-01T03:37:29] Paolo ‚Å≠: Now is more difficult to get refunded
[2023-11-01T03:37:46] haku: oh lol. first time this happened to me in alibaba. normally my stuff gets delivered
[2023-11-01T03:38:10] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes there‚Äôs always the first time
[2023-11-01T03:38:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: Another my friend get it from your same seller and delivered
[2023-11-01T03:42:20] haku: lucky. it was shipped to the US but last minuite they wanted me to pick it up when trade assurance stepped in. they said it will be delivered 50days max to my door. its been so long
[2023-11-01T03:42:59] haku: i bought that to ride during the summer.
[2023-11-01T03:43:45] haku: and i will not rent a truck and make the drive to LA.
[2023-11-01T03:44:00] haku: that will not fit in my car
[2023-11-01T03:58:39] haku: well my vesc bomber dreams will not happen. ill just buy a frame localy and make my own
[2023-11-01T04:41:48] haku: lol what a joke.
[2023-11-01T06:11:10] rosheee: no problem 170-190a 16s6p
[2023-11-01T13:25:45] Gabe Enzo: No way around this no matter what I set voltage to.
[2023-11-01T13:26:02] Gabe Enzo: I set max volts to 90 or 85 or 84 it doesn't matter
[2023-11-01T13:26:46] Mirono escooters: Kaput
[2023-11-01T13:27:10] Konstantin: How much voltage read vesc?
[2023-11-01T13:29:20] Gabe Enzo: 80.80v
[2023-11-01T13:30:39] Konstantin: Ok w fw y using?
[2023-11-01T13:30:46] Gabe Enzo: I dated to 6.02.
[2023-11-01T13:30:54] Gabe Enzo: So the vesc is 6.02
[2023-11-01T13:31:08] Gabe Enzo: and the mobile app well I don't know if there's a way to even check that
[2023-11-01T13:31:12] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_10672@01-11-2023_13-31-12.jpg>
[2023-11-01T13:31:18] Gabe Enzo: Apparently 6.02 is old.
[2023-11-01T13:31:24] Konstantin: If you write 84v like hi voltage, and press read. Which value read vesc?
[2023-11-01T13:31:43] Konstantin: 6.02 - laste stabyxD
[2023-11-01T13:32:14] cihan: Did anyone try super capacitor connected parallel to the battery? Maybe it's not a bad idea to draw more current when needed when battery charge is low.
[2023-11-01T13:33:19] Gabe Enzo: It seems the mobile app has no option for that.
[2023-11-01T13:34:07] Konstantin: <photos/photo_10673@01-11-2023_13-34-07.jpg>
[2023-11-01T13:34:47] Mirono escooters: If you on 6.05 app yes, lol
[2023-11-01T13:35:07] Mirono escooters: No, pointless
[2023-11-01T13:35:16] Mirono escooters: Doesn't store nearly enough energy The weight and size is horrendous
[2023-11-01T13:35:33] Mirono escooters: Better add 1p batt
[2023-11-01T13:37:59] Gabe Enzo: I do NOT have that tab
[2023-11-01T13:38:10] Gabe Enzo: called motor cfg
[2023-11-01T13:38:28] Mirono escooters: ü§®
[2023-11-01T13:38:30] Mirono escooters: Oh god
[2023-11-01T13:39:26] Mirono escooters: Just.. swipe? Haven't been on tinder ya?
[2023-11-01T13:39:40] Gabe Enzo: OH
[2023-11-01T13:39:49] Gabe Enzo: facepalm
[2023-11-01T13:41:30] Mirono escooters: Atleast F ING try
[2023-11-01T13:41:34] Mirono escooters: Come on dude, this is laughable
[2023-11-01T13:45:15] Gabe Enzo: I have been for the last 18h.
[2023-11-01T13:46:37] Gabe Enzo: yeah same overvoltage fault just come back to 76v every single Time after I press save (write)
[2023-11-01T13:46:44] Gabe Enzo: kinda pissed rn
[2023-11-01T13:48:31] Gabe Enzo: Where can I get It from? on the Vedder site there is only basic packages for Mac and android etc.
[2023-11-01T13:48:37] Gabe Enzo: I don't even know what version I'm using
[2023-11-01T13:53:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes don‚Äôt make sense
[2023-11-01T13:54:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: They said is their own software, but obviously some guy dispatched the file and discovered it was vesc tool based
[2023-11-01T13:54:50] Gabe Enzo: Lawsuit incoming right
[2023-11-01T14:00:13] Mirono escooters: So we've been having chats about overv error since YESTERDAY And now you discover the tab
[2023-11-01T14:00:14] Mirono escooters: Great xd
[2023-11-01T14:01:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: Not for chinaüòÇ
[2023-11-01T14:01:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: They never apply foreign laws hahaha
[2023-11-01T14:11:59] sombre_enfant: Seems good
[2023-11-01T14:13:52] Gabe Enzo: do I need slow abs current limit
[2023-11-01T14:17:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: Safer OFF
[2023-11-01T14:20:45] Unknown: Are you able to help me getting my 750 up & running? I definitely have knowledge and experience but still have things that I need to figure out how to get functioning.
[2023-11-01T14:20:57] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Might also be battery issue
[2023-11-01T14:21:02] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: What battery are you using?
[2023-11-01T14:21:03] Gabe Enzo: I fixed it now
[2023-11-01T14:21:08] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Oh ok
[2023-11-01T14:21:10] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Gut
[2023-11-01T14:21:10] Gabe Enzo: It's fine. it was firmware.
[2023-11-01T14:21:13] Gabe Enzo: now I have another issue
[2023-11-01T14:21:17] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: üíÄ
[2023-11-01T14:21:19] Mirono escooters: Moh
[2023-11-01T14:21:23] Mirono escooters: Surprising
[2023-11-01T14:21:35] Gabe Enzo: The motor grinds when I press the arrows but yet motor calibration works lol (it can't be shorted)
[2023-11-01T14:21:40] Gabe Enzo: I'll show
[2023-11-01T14:21:53] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2023-11-01T14:27:20] Finn: Motor setup when
[2023-11-01T14:28:13] Gabe Enzo: Motor setup worked 15 seconds prior
[2023-11-01T14:28:25] Finn: Hm get different motor
[2023-11-01T14:28:27] Finn: Lol
[2023-11-01T14:28:38] Gabe Enzo: Lmao, this one is working fine, it's just me.
[2023-11-01T14:28:48] Gabe Enzo: Not till the 9th
[2023-11-01T14:29:10] Mirono escooters: Ez
[2023-11-01T14:29:22] sombre_enfant: Bro need his fix
[2023-11-01T14:29:33] Gabe Enzo: By god if I get a new motor I'll get the same issue
[2023-11-01T14:29:39] Gabe Enzo: no joke
[2023-11-01T14:31:25] Unknown: You can use a keyed switch to turn the controller on & off as long as you‚Äôre not running power through it. If you totally want to disconnect power then you can look into a loop key
[2023-11-01T14:32:19] Gabe Enzo: Please it's been 3 months since I've had my scooter move
[2023-11-01T14:32:24] Gabe Enzo: üíÄ
[2023-11-01T14:37:18] puneDir: Probably you resetted the motor config instead of saving
[2023-11-01T14:37:25] puneDir: Thats why it reads overvoltage
[2023-11-01T14:50:49] KierreKikkeli: Sc√§mmed, they didnt have skf or even same brand bearings only snr and ntn
[2023-11-01T14:51:13] Happy Giraffe: Then get a wireless relay or something?üòÅ
[2023-11-01T14:52:33] Happy Giraffe: I meant 750g outrunner motor calibrating option. But feel free to post here so everyone can help
[2023-11-01T14:53:41] KierreKikkeli: is it fine if i use mismatched bearings? sounds like a bad idea as apparently snr has higher (tolerances?) than ntn. edit or are they the same brand, google is confusing me, i swear to god its a trash engine now a days
[2023-11-01T14:54:21] Happy Giraffe: ‚Ç¨2.82 31%OFF | Hot DC12V 10A Relay 1 CH Wireless RF Remote Control Switch Transmitter with Receiver Module 433mhz LED Remote Control https://a.aliexpress.com/_mP99Jmk

[2023-11-01T15:03:35] NetworkDir: With relay and esp32
[2023-11-01T15:03:53] NetworkDir: Over bluetooth or wifi
[2023-11-01T15:13:29] Gabe Enzo: Don't have that issue anymore. now the issue is the motor isnt turning with keys. Also, I can't get 1zunas script to work. Perhaps now it will, I have the correct versions for everything
[2023-11-01T15:13:48] Gabe Enzo: Right. Ill get to it.
[2023-11-01T15:14:24] NetworkDir: Yes sure with arrows not will work
[2023-11-01T15:14:58] NetworkDir: Throttle needed
[2023-11-01T15:24:45] Happy Giraffe: You welcomeüëç
[2023-11-01T15:57:58] Gabe Enzo: @jamessoderstrom I'm getting a no Firmware read response after I updated my esc to no limit

[2023-11-01T16:46:15] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: ahh oke
[2023-11-01T16:46:31] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: tried ortega?
[2023-11-01T16:46:53] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-11-01T16:46:56] Oreo huzky: Observer gain?
[2023-11-01T16:46:58] Mirono escooters: Something something
[2023-11-01T16:47:02] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_10676@01-11-2023_16-47-02.jpg>
[2023-11-01T16:47:09] Oreo huzky: Bacon bacon
[2023-11-01T16:47:09] Mirono escooters: I've tried both mxlemming and ortega
[2023-11-01T16:48:22] Mirono escooters: Yeah no, after 4-5kmh it goes brt and just, works against itself
[2023-11-01T16:49:12] Oreo huzky: When motor stutter doesn‚Äôt observer gain help?
[2023-11-01T16:49:24] Mirono escooters: I do not know
[2023-11-01T16:49:30] Mirono escooters: It totally loses track. It's not a little
[2023-11-01T16:49:33] Mirono escooters: Only on ground
[2023-11-01T16:50:02] Oreo huzky: Try doubling or halving observer gain helped me with 75100 a lot
[2023-11-01T16:50:15] Mirono escooters: The dash shows my batt % when it loses track So it's confused
[2023-11-01T16:50:20] Mirono escooters: Going from halls to sensorless
[2023-11-01T16:50:28] Mirono escooters: It's right there it goes nuts
[2023-11-01T16:51:30] puneDir: I had the same Let me know the solution if you fix it
[2023-11-01T16:51:39] puneDir: Motor shakes at low speeds
[2023-11-01T16:51:54] puneDir: Boost comes at low speed and motor shakes makes grgrgrgr
[2023-11-01T16:52:00] Mirono escooters: It's just not switching to sensorless properly I'dk if this is dash issue, 6.05 issue or whatever
[2023-11-01T16:52:10] puneDir: Can you send vid
[2023-11-01T16:52:57] Mirono escooters: Uhm, going low power "works"
[2023-11-01T16:53:06] Mirono escooters: It can't be saturation. It's at 40/80
[2023-11-01T16:53:36] puneDir: When you floor it it shakes
[2023-11-01T16:53:36] Mirono escooters: It's riding at low power Till it looses track and then u have to go to 0kmh
[2023-11-01T16:53:41] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2023-11-01T16:53:42] puneDir: Goes after 20 kmh
[2023-11-01T16:53:48] puneDir: Only at low speeds
[2023-11-01T16:53:50] Mirono escooters: Can't hit that
[2023-11-01T16:53:55] puneDir: Press gas slowly
[2023-11-01T16:54:04] puneDir: After passing 17-18 its gone
[2023-11-01T16:54:22] Mirono escooters: It looses track at any high power level
[2023-11-01T16:54:28] Mirono escooters: Have to go to 0kmh to work again
[2023-11-01T16:54:36] puneDir: Weird
[2023-11-01T16:54:40] puneDir: Mines wasnt that bad
[2023-11-01T16:54:48] puneDir: <animation>
[2023-11-01T16:54:57] Mirono escooters: Let's see bldc
[2023-11-01T16:55:05] puneDir: This is why all of my vids was starting from 20
[2023-11-01T16:56:10] Mirono escooters: Bldc no better
[2023-11-01T16:56:22] Mirono escooters: Or it's 6.02 issue, or its me retard issue.
[2023-11-01T16:56:50] puneDir: I had 6.02 too
[2023-11-01T16:57:21] Mirono escooters: I'm at 6.05
[2023-11-01T16:57:41] Mirono escooters: <video_file>
[2023-11-01T16:58:13] puneDir: Mines wasnt like that
[2023-11-01T17:01:46] Mirono escooters: So tldr Anything aboves 20% throttle makes vesc totally lose track At any speed It rides at low power It's not sensorless issue 6.05 and izuna script
[2023-11-01T17:01:56] Mirono escooters: Observer doesn't change anything
[2023-11-01T17:05:04] Mirono escooters: @kawaiinekololis Think it could remotely be dash? Or shouldn't I even bother
[2023-11-01T17:13:27] Mirono escooters: I'm more looking at the weird motor detection values, since they are high But nothing super concerning.
[2023-11-01T17:15:43] Mirono escooters: I cant even try 6.02 since g30 dash
[2023-11-01T17:19:25] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: ehm sure you can
[2023-11-01T17:19:34] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: there is also a g30 script for 6.02
[2023-11-01T17:19:51] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: just without ADC support (means ebrake is shit but overall it works)
[2023-11-01T17:20:14] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: nah why should it affect this
[2023-11-01T17:21:08] Mirono escooters: Well, I'll go 6.02, so we can identify the issue. hopefully.
[2023-11-01T17:21:17] Mirono escooters: So just massive deadpoints?
[2023-11-01T17:21:24] Mirono escooters: Ebrake isn't my concern, got good brakes
[2023-11-01T17:21:32] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: wdym with deadpoints
[2023-11-01T17:21:47] Mirono escooters: If u can't Cali throttle Or
[2023-11-01T17:21:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: nah its already setup correctly
[2023-11-01T17:22:03] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: just put script and done
[2023-11-01T17:22:07] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: easier than on 6.05
[2023-11-01T17:42:07] Mirono escooters: Lol, ok
[2023-11-01T17:42:15] Mirono escooters: Then I'll bother you guys tomorrow if it works : D
[2023-11-01T17:42:33] Mirono escooters: It would make sense if it's 6.05 issue I guess.
[2023-11-01T17:42:44] Mirono escooters: And what about the ebrake
[2023-11-01T17:51:24] puneDir: @Mirono_escooters how do you compiled 6.05
[2023-11-01T17:51:32] puneDir: Is it worth to switch from 6.02
[2023-11-01T17:51:56] Mirono escooters: Izuna did
[2023-11-01T17:52:02] Mirono escooters: Well uh, since my scoot isn't working I'd say no
[2023-11-01T17:52:07] Happy Giraffe: Have you set hall interpolation?
[2023-11-01T17:52:08] Mirono escooters: Only reason I went 6.05 is for the dash
[2023-11-01T17:52:16] Mirono escooters: Ignore sensorless switching
[2023-11-01T17:52:18] Mirono escooters: Skip to tldr
[2023-11-01T17:52:27] puneDir: doesnt the script also works with 6.02
[2023-11-01T17:52:44] Happy Giraffe: You use any compensation like Lambda etc?
[2023-11-01T17:52:50] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-11-01T17:52:55] puneDir: with pedals connected to dash
[2023-11-01T17:52:59] Mirono escooters: ADC tuning or whatev was 6.05
[2023-11-01T17:53:17] Happy Giraffe: Try lambda, you need to change other setting also to lambda in order for it to work
[2023-11-01T17:53:23] Mirono escooters: I'm not home anymore And tomorrow code orange So
[2023-11-01T17:53:39] Mirono escooters: Why would it be dat? Its such a weird thing I've never seen before
[2023-11-01T17:54:05] puneDir: why dont you use 602
[2023-11-01T17:54:39] Mirono escooters: I told you, the ADC tuning thing
[2023-11-01T17:54:45] Mirono escooters: But I try 602 tomorrow ü§∑
[2023-11-01T17:54:55] Mirono escooters: It would make the most sense
[2023-11-01T17:55:08] Happy Giraffe: Yeah it's weird
[2023-11-01T17:55:18] puneDir: your motor configuration was weird too
[2023-11-01T17:55:21] puneDir: That resistance
[2023-11-01T18:02:08] Mirono escooters: It's consequent. I retry and retry
[2023-11-01T19:09:25] Happy Giraffe: Now its nice to not rely on motor brake anymore. Soon 203mm on front and back. Bled front Magura to be super aggressiveüòÇ That in addition to having studded tires will beüî• on winter
[2023-11-01T19:16:26] puneDir: Anybody has a link fot good gps tracker works with sim
[2023-11-01T19:30:15] haku: Share with your friends https://speedometergps.page.link/Share
[2023-11-01T19:30:15] haku: this gps works well for me
[2023-11-01T19:31:01] haku: a little lag compared to vesc tool but its not too bad
[2023-11-01T19:33:13] puneDir: No gps tracker
[2023-11-01T19:33:18] puneDir: To find when its lost

[2023-11-01T20:14:04] francois schempers: just hide an airtage + Samsung tag in the Dec, so if anyone with any smartphone is near it, you'll have its location
[2023-11-01T20:14:52] Mirono escooters: Recovered Dad's ebike like dis
[2023-11-01T20:16:04] puneDir: I also have them but i need real time locstion
[2023-11-01T20:16:40] francois schempers: it's real time as long as any smartphone is near it
[2023-11-01T20:16:48] puneDir: im not in a big city

[2023-11-01T20:54:40] haku: this is worth $400? i have one on the way but i dont mind another one with kcaps.

[2023-11-01T21:49:05] haku: where you get glitter? i like that kweld has a community
[2023-11-01T21:49:13] Happy Giraffe: Move outside TurkeyüòÅ Then your life won't be as limited when building stuff

[2023-11-01T21:52:31] haku: oh. is there sparw parts to glitter machines?
[2023-11-01T21:52:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Stock wire of kweld is 8mm2, this one is 35mm2

[2023-11-01T21:57:57] haku: the tire rotation threads on the back is suppose to be like that?
[2023-11-01T21:58:26] puneDir: Yes its bad i know
[2023-11-01T21:58:30] puneDir: I didnt mounted it yet
[2023-11-01T21:59:12] haku: just wondering. looking good
[2023-11-01T22:21:17] Mirono escooters: Watersliding 101
[2023-11-01T22:34:40] Mirono escooters: Update: Halving my motor inductance fixed my issues.
[2023-11-01T22:34:59] Mirono escooters: Do you guys think this is A: vesc issue B: firmware issue
[2023-11-01T22:37:49] Mirono escooters: Ok not totally, but it rides. Above 30kmh, it randomly gets more power, and is totally smooth. I'll continue messing with it.
[2023-11-01T23:06:02] Mirono escooters: 6,05 full of bugs, it seems. going to 6,02
[2023-11-01T23:07:41] haku: is it easy to downgrade firmware? or its very complicated?
[2023-11-01T23:09:09] NetworkDir: yes easy
[2023-11-01T23:09:39] haku: no need for special cables? aside from usbc
[2023-11-01T23:10:08] NetworkDir: if you brick vesc you need to programer hardware
[2023-11-01T23:10:54] haku: i see.
[2023-11-01T23:24:46] haku: good deal or this battery is outdated?
[2023-11-01T23:24:47] haku: <photos/photo_10682@01-11-2023_23-24-47.jpg>
[2023-11-01T23:50:37] Mirono escooters: Goh
[2023-11-01T23:50:39] Mirono escooters: Depends for what
[2023-11-01T23:56:44] Mirono escooters: @punedir Lowering inductance from 420? Something to 150 did it
[2023-11-01T23:57:01] Mirono escooters: Just lower and lower, till its gone You'll notice it gets better Use Ortega original

[2023-11-02T00:29:54] Mirono escooters: Here it's like "Eh"
[2023-11-02T00:39:27] haku: maybe practice spot welding copper sandwiches
[2023-11-02T00:40:27] Mirono escooters: Perfectly fine cells for that xd
[2023-11-02T00:40:31] Mirono escooters: Make a powerbank
[2023-11-02T00:40:34] Mirono escooters: Great start
[2023-11-02T02:27:23] Happy Giraffe: Weighted bike, 37kgüòÇ
[2023-11-02T03:08:24] haku: not too bad.
[2023-11-02T03:08:38] haku: thats actually pretty good for an ebike
[2023-11-02T03:09:58] haku: my engwe ep2 pro weighs a little more. fat folding bike 750w 48v
[2023-11-02T03:10:13] haku: and very slow
[2023-11-02T03:12:04] Happy Giraffe: Mine just wants a battery upgrade, then it will be a monster of 6000-8000w whatever this motor can take without hubsinks
[2023-11-02T03:23:32] haku: mine is pretty pointless to upgrade battery. bike folds no where to put it.
[2023-11-02T03:26:57] Happy Giraffe: Yup, better keep it as stock
[2023-11-02T03:27:45] haku: sometimes i think about if the small motor can handle more volts.
[2023-11-02T03:29:05] haku: this 750 watt motor
[2023-11-02T03:30:33] haku: can hide the battery in the bike rack bag. but all the weight is in the back
[2023-11-02T03:31:32] haku: geared hub too. very noisy
[2023-11-02T04:36:11] haku: the mxus motor is it bigger than qs205?
[2023-11-02T05:55:57] Happy Giraffe: Bit smaller, 45mm magnets vs 50mm on QS.
[2023-11-02T05:56:31] Happy Giraffe: This is the biggest one that fits normal mtb dropouts with just bending it few mm by handüòÖ

[2023-11-02T08:20:09] Happy Giraffe: @roscheeee A good fit with your granny ebike?üòÇ
[2023-11-02T12:25:58] Mirono escooters: Code orange Seems like someone isn't riding their g30 today
[2023-11-02T12:36:46] Happy Giraffe: My studded tires are nice and the brakes work great aswell. Galfer pads on Magura is brutalityüî•
[2023-11-02T12:38:55] Mirono escooters: Studded tires makes no sense in BE
[2023-11-02T12:38:58] Mirono escooters: For the 1 day snow
[2023-11-02T12:43:06] Gabe Enzo: Lol, the button keys started to work @jamessoderstrom.
[2023-11-02T13:17:00] Gabe Enzo: It's gonna be a long week.
[2023-11-02T13:18:35] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2023-11-02T15:44:50] Gabe Enzo: whoever told me to try 750w for motor calibration, it makes a gnarly noise üíÄ
[2023-11-02T15:44:58] Gabe Enzo: Generic works better.
[2023-11-02T15:59:32] Mirono escooters: Happy did
[2023-11-02T15:59:35] Mirono escooters: Too low power
[2023-11-02T16:06:58] Happy Giraffe: Never had that issue even with blade motor or my current ebike motor works just fineü•¥
[2023-11-02T16:07:17] Happy Giraffe: Gnarly noise could be hall issue
[2023-11-02T16:07:34] sombre_enfant: Bro been setting up his vesc for weeks
[2023-11-02T16:36:10] Gabe Enzo: Can't be, was spinning earlier
[2023-11-02T16:36:56] Gabe Enzo: It was funny a few days ago
[2023-11-02T16:37:59] Gabe Enzo: Fault code abs overcurrent.
[2023-11-02T16:40:25] sombre_enfant: Slow abs
[2023-11-02T16:40:38] sombre_enfant: Up abs current
[2023-11-02T16:40:53] Gabe Enzo: it's set to false
[2023-11-02T16:40:59] Gabe Enzo: it's at 100a is that normal
[2023-11-02T16:42:47] sombre_enfant: Put it
[2023-11-02T16:43:00] sombre_enfant: Idk your setting man
[2023-11-02T16:43:08] Gabe Enzo: put it to what
[2023-11-02T16:43:09] Gabe Enzo: true?
[2023-11-02T16:44:02] sombre_enfant: Ye dumba
[2023-11-02T16:45:03] Gabe Enzo: Didn't change anything.
[2023-11-02T16:45:04] Gabe Enzo: lmao
[2023-11-02T16:45:38] Gabe Enzo: I think at this point the only thing that could be the cause of the dash not working is a faulty Xiaomi accelerator and brake
[2023-11-02T16:52:13] Mirono escooters: That's not a fix..

[2023-11-02T16:56:43] Unknown: It‚Äôs going down definitely no turning back now. Had to find where the 12v tapped into the brake sensors since I‚Äôm running sabvoton with high brake. I basically have everything figured out except how to get my 12v brake light functional . Definitely don‚Äôt wanna use ADC adapter even though I ordered one just in case but really don‚Äôt have room to place anything else
[2023-11-02T17:19:07] Unknown: Anyone knows how I can use a 5v signal to trigger a 12v relay? I‚Äôm leaning towards this but kneed help or some ideas
[2023-11-02T17:28:15] francois schempers: you could silicone it and place it outside
[2023-11-02T17:31:39] puneDir: 20S 8P Dual 75100 Powered Custom (ish) stem 6720 Watts 10.5X3 Off Road Tires Dual G30 g1 (Soon it would be 20s12p with dual exa monorim and dual z10x motors)
[2023-11-02T17:32:01] puneDir: I will work on its look when it arrives
[2023-11-02T17:48:31] Gabe Enzo: where can I find 6.05 no limits firmware?
[2023-11-02T17:53:24] Patrick: How it is possible took 160cells in G30? ü§î
[2023-11-02T17:53:47] Gabe Enzo: not 21700.
[2023-11-02T17:54:19] Mirono escooters: 18650
[2023-11-02T17:54:22] Mirono escooters: 21700 fit less
[2023-11-02T17:54:47] Gabe Enzo: @Mirono_escooters I think this is the last thing I need.
[2023-11-02T17:54:57] Mirono escooters: How is that possible
[2023-11-02T17:55:01] Mirono escooters: Motor isnt turning yet
[2023-11-02T17:55:02] Patrick: I build my 20s6p and it is full with one controller
[2023-11-02T17:55:12] Mirono escooters: Ye
[2023-11-02T17:55:14] puneDir: 80 bag 80 in
[2023-11-02T17:55:29] Gabe Enzo: The keyboard don't work all the time apparently anyways.
[2023-11-02T17:55:53] Gabe Enzo: I was using the 6.05 script with 6.02 I think
[2023-11-02T17:55:58] Gabe Enzo: Something like that
[2023-11-02T17:56:01] Patrick: Ah ok because i not see a bag at the picture üòÅ

[2023-11-02T18:19:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Far as i remember you had pro motor right?
[2023-11-02T18:37:00] Gabe Enzo: Yes. Although it's not the main issue now. I'm just wondering why the Xiaomi esc doesn't show speed / battery data / acc and brake don't work after parsing.
[2023-11-02T18:37:20] Gabe Enzo: I have everything right now, 6.02 firmware on all. 6.05 I can't find so I cannot test.

[2023-11-02T19:10:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: Solenoid / inductor
[2023-11-02T19:18:31] heimdler: Pretty dramatic
[2023-11-02T19:20:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I mean you should use real values , also probably will saturate easy really small engine
[2023-11-02T19:21:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If you follow the how to steps it should work
[2023-11-02T19:21:11] Gabe Enzo: Lmao the motor is burned
[2023-11-02T19:21:32] Gabe Enzo: Thank fuck for vesc because this is how I killed 4 xescs
[2023-11-02T19:21:43] Mirono escooters: Oh god
[2023-11-02T19:22:01] Gabe Enzo: Tis the motor I used at 10s with max fw

[2023-11-02T19:36:43] Gabe Enzo: You've totally bought me over on getting a surron frame
[2023-11-02T19:37:11] Gabe Enzo: did you paint that blue?
[2023-11-02T19:48:52] Happy Giraffe: Cooked motor
[2023-11-02T19:50:56] Gabe Enzo: Lol no way you're using the stock motor
[2023-11-02T19:51:08] Gabe Enzo: Y no hub?
[2023-11-02T19:51:23] Gabe Enzo: might as well cook it for fun
[2023-11-02T19:59:19] Gabe Enzo: Are the generic high wattage motors all 6.0" or 6.1 or 6.5"?
[2023-11-02T20:01:36] Mirono escooters: Middrive just makes more sense, size wise, and cooling
[2023-11-02T20:01:43] Mirono escooters: Way more power in small motor
[2023-11-02T20:01:58] Mirono escooters: And balance wise, lol (On that note, im still hub fan, just listing facts)
[2023-11-02T20:05:36] Gabe Enzo: Yeah that's just canned motors for ya lol
[2023-11-02T20:12:06] Oreo huzky: Where is the battery mounted?
[2023-11-02T20:12:43] puneDir: Its on the neck (bag) and inside
[2023-11-02T20:13:13] Oreo huzky: Same same
[2023-11-02T20:14:12] Oreo huzky: But 20s 12p is really heavy my bag broke from 20s 8p
[2023-11-02T20:18:38] haku: this is awsome. what is the custom stem?
[2023-11-02T20:25:55] Gabe Enzo: Are the 1000w'ers usually 6"?
[2023-11-02T20:42:31] sombre_enfant: Do single G2 with 70h 22x3 is a good idea ?
[2023-11-02T20:43:23] Mirono escooters: If ya make the motor fit
[2023-11-02T21:19:20] Face de Pin Suc√©: it's a good frame honestly
[2023-11-02T21:19:40] Face de Pin Suc√©: yes with the controller ;)
[2023-11-02T21:19:54] sombre_enfant: Is it hard to manage wheelie on it ?
[2023-11-02T21:19:58] Face de Pin Suc√©: for now we are, but we have a motor upgraded soon
[2023-11-02T21:20:06] Face de Pin Suc√©: really easy
[2023-11-02T21:22:54] Gabe Enzo: Basically every surronfag can wheelie.
[2023-11-02T21:22:59] Gabe Enzo: Haha
[2023-11-02T21:24:02] haku: wich surron is that?
[2023-11-02T21:32:56] Pablo Fernandez: Light Bee i think
[2023-11-02T21:34:06] haku: the ultra bee is the only surron that comes in 72v from the factory yea?
[2023-11-02T21:37:03] Gabe Enzo: Pretty sure they're all 72v but don't take my word for it.
[2023-11-02T21:38:15] haku: ahh. kid in my neighborhood has a 60v one. maybe its a older model
[2023-11-02T21:39:45] Pablo Fernandez: All 60v at least old models
[2023-11-02T21:39:56] Pablo Fernandez: Not sure if any new model came 72v
[2023-11-02T21:46:48] haku: i like that surron/talaria has a big community. its just some states treat it as a motorcycle due to no pedals.
[2023-11-02T21:49:01] haku: here in nevada. its not too bad. i see them alot.
[2023-11-02T21:52:22] Pablo Fernandez: Here they are street legal if you fill some documents
[2023-11-02T21:53:36] haku: i see. is it the same for all pevs? or just some with high wattage?
[2023-11-02T21:54:06] Pablo Fernandez: No, high watt escooters will be fully ilegal in 2027
[2023-11-02T21:54:33] Pablo Fernandez: But you can register a sur ron as a motorcycle
[2023-11-02T21:55:13] haku: dang. laws always change. im hoping evs will be the future
[2023-11-02T21:55:58] haku: *future of transportation
[2023-11-02T21:58:26] Pablo Fernandez: I mean i am getting a f type this year, with fucking european laws i Will try to contaminate more than india
[2023-11-02T22:01:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: Dual flipsky with on off
[2023-11-02T22:01:31] haku: i dont want to go to politics but the government is promoting the switch to evs. having tax bonuses and discounts to buying tesla.
[2023-11-02T22:01:58] haku: or switching to any ev
[2023-11-02T22:20:02] Gabe Enzo: They will be regardless.
[2023-11-02T22:21:34] Gabe Enzo: They're upping gas prices while suppressing EVS. it's a recipe for war.
[2023-11-02T22:21:45] Gabe Enzo: Only a matter of time before people start protesting hard
[2023-11-02T22:22:38] Mirono escooters: Doubt it
[2023-11-02T22:23:14] Mirono escooters: But ay, wrong group for politics : d
[2023-11-02T22:25:01] haku: sorry to bring it up. but yea vesc is awsome
[2023-11-02T22:25:21] Mirono escooters: I'm wondering if anyone got a alternative for 3shul for the surrons?
[2023-11-02T22:25:35] Mirono escooters: I know trampa, surron Mp2 not enough amps 75200 too unreliable Looking for 500a batt+ ?
[2023-11-02T22:25:44] Mirono escooters: Vesc is too good
[2023-11-02T22:25:53] sombre_enfant: U got one broski ?
[2023-11-02T22:25:53] puneDir: benjamin vedders ear must be having noises
[2023-11-02T22:26:02] Mirono escooters: I love Vedder, that he does that mostly on his own, so quick respond, and so dedicated.
[2023-11-02T22:26:09] Mirono escooters: From my friend I still got the bomber haha
[2023-11-02T22:26:32] Mirono escooters: If that thing doesn't sell before I finish my MP2 I'm riding itüòÇüòÇ
[2023-11-02T22:26:41] haku: that looks amazing! full blown motorcycle though
[2023-11-02T22:26:59] puneDir: U got surron?
[2023-11-02T22:27:01] Mirono escooters: Yeah, that's no bike that
[2023-11-02T22:27:12] Mirono escooters: I have bomber I ask in my Friends name
[2023-11-02T22:27:21] Mirono escooters: My bomber gets MP2 ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2023-11-02T22:28:19] haku: im jelly i really want a bomber but these surrons are getting appealing with posts like these
[2023-11-02T22:29:34] Mirono escooters: <animation>
[2023-11-02T22:29:47] puneDir: Can i make an e motorcycle with welder and some steel pipes?
[2023-11-02T22:29:51] Mirono escooters: There's really no "better" in my opinion You just pick a side depending on factors
[2023-11-02T22:29:56] Mirono escooters: Go ahead
[2023-11-02T22:30:02] puneDir: Should i?
[2023-11-02T22:30:08] Mirono escooters: If you have the skills?
[2023-11-02T22:30:35] haku: sure man. thats more impressive if you make your own imo
[2023-11-02T22:31:02] Mirono escooters: I wouldn't trust my welds at those speeds
[2023-11-02T22:31:09] Mirono escooters: I'm happy enough my stander holdsüòÇüòÇ
[2023-11-02T23:15:47] Mirono escooters: Ah the master
[2023-11-02T23:29:45] Happy Giraffe: No
[2023-11-02T23:30:34] Happy Giraffe: Maybe for 25kmh but above that slightest misaligment of frame is a catastrophe. Just buy a used 50cc moped that rolls with broken engine
[2023-11-02T23:32:20] haku: there is a canadian youtuber that build one with a qs273 motorcycle hub. looks like it came off the dealership
[2023-11-02T23:33:19] haku: https://youtu.be/gYs_jYUyaoY?si=M3pFu8F1Yi8tFh_J
[2023-11-02T23:34:04] Mirono escooters: Well thats my plan later.. instead of bomber Use a road legal frame.. so i can atleast RIDE IT
[2023-11-02T23:34:08] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-11-02T23:36:02] haku: its very inspiring. i wish i had fabrication skills
[2023-11-02T23:36:21] Mirono escooters: Never too old to learn

[2023-11-02T23:46:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: But not very soon

[2023-11-02T23:52:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is more or less far driver
[2023-11-02T23:52:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: More or less same circuit , just different design
[2023-11-02T23:53:01] Mirono escooters: I dont like it

[2023-11-02T23:56:40] haku: i need those skills
[2023-11-03T00:01:22] cihan: What are the green areas on top of the cells? Oxide or is cell top removed?
[2023-11-03T00:01:50] Jan: Insulation paper i guess, i have not made it üòÖ
[2023-11-03T00:02:23] cihan: Insulation paper? What for?
[2023-11-03T00:02:46] Mirono escooters: Extra protection on + side
[2023-11-03T00:02:55] Mirono escooters: Since burning through it would mean shorting the cell
[2023-11-03T00:03:21] Jan: Probably insulation üò¨
[2023-11-03T00:03:30] sombre_enfant: Is that Punedir's battery ?
[2023-11-03T00:04:19] Gabe Enzo: Lmao
[2023-11-03T00:04:22] Gabe Enzo: vape 6s
[2023-11-03T00:05:01] Gabe Enzo: You used elf bars
[2023-11-03T00:06:34] cihan: I had such a terrible cell solder in past. But it was one cell only. I had a digital thermometer which runs with a button cell but it emptied the cell in 4 months. I soldered an AA cell and some cables and it ran for 11 years.) I soldered another AA and it's still running.)
[2023-11-03T00:15:20] Mirono escooters: Welcome
[2023-11-03T00:21:57] haku: for some people soldering works. its harder imo
[2023-11-03T00:24:21] Mirono escooters: O no no no
[2023-11-03T00:24:34] Mirono escooters: That's just bad, sotry
[2023-11-03T00:33:02] Gabe Enzo: ruin cells speedrun
[2023-11-03T00:34:57] haku: i agree. but there is a way to do it safer. holding the iron for a long time will kill the cell
[2023-11-03T00:38:03] cihan: Harder, surface oxides very fast, need to heat cell more. They use some different flux or just mineral oil to cover surface while heating to prevent oxidation but it still heats cells a lot. Using pre melted solder on cold cell surface causes cold solder. There's no way not to heat cell surface. Only heating time could be shortened.
[2023-11-03T00:38:32] Gabe Enzo: It works for small packs.
[2023-11-03T00:38:36] Gabe Enzo: That's it.
[2023-11-03T00:39:04] Mirono escooters: It's just a shit idea
[2023-11-03T00:39:06] Gabe Enzo: it always becomes loose
[2023-11-03T00:39:08] Mirono escooters: There is no good for soldering
[2023-11-03T00:39:08] Gabe Enzo: Ye
[2023-11-03T00:39:18] Mirono escooters: I don't want to hear any reasoning or excuses
[2023-11-03T00:39:22] Mirono escooters: No point
[2023-11-03T00:39:39] haku: im not recomending it. but some folks have success stories with this method. very scar.
[2023-11-03T00:39:42] Mirono escooters: A short soldering= a spotweld
[2023-11-03T00:39:48] Mirono escooters: A spotweld is just the better way of soldering
[2023-11-03T00:40:03] Mirono escooters: "succes Stories" doesn't deny facts and reasoning
[2023-11-03T00:40:13] Mirono escooters: Same way ppl say 20s on stock Xiaomi works hahaha
[2023-11-03T00:40:20] Gabe Enzo: üóø
[2023-11-03T00:40:31] Gabe Enzo: used to be me
[2023-11-03T00:40:41] Gabe Enzo: "I did it and it works"
[2023-11-03T00:40:57] Mirono escooters: And you can never argue with them
[2023-11-03T00:41:00] Mirono escooters: They dont like facts
[2023-11-03T00:41:16] Jhinzuo ~~: Stock mean no upgraded parts right ?
[2023-11-03T00:41:20] Mirono escooters: But atleast vesc people do it properly and are reasonable : D That's why I love this group.
[2023-11-03T00:41:48] Gabe Enzo: other than resistor mod of course.
[2023-11-03T00:41:58] cihan: Sure, induction leads to spot welding.
[2023-11-03T00:55:53] Happy Giraffe: Yup he knows what hes doing, propably has 10+ years on welding and designing stufd
[2023-11-03T00:56:33] Happy Giraffe: I also wanted to make my own dirt bike but in the end its much better to buy existing body and then modify it (you can remove all unimportant internal parts with grinder and have a kickass battery)üòÅ
[2023-11-03T01:07:30] haku: its crazy he did it without a cnc machine
[2023-11-03T01:51:25] Happy Giraffe: You must know Paul BrodyüòÅ Check his youtube stuff
[2023-11-03T01:55:10] haku: its cool that these guys make em out of thier garages
[2023-11-03T02:07:30] haku: someone giving this for free in fb marketplace. i wish i had room. it be cool to convert electric.
[2023-11-03T02:10:10] haku: 2024 lol
[2023-11-03T07:15:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: Light Bee X
[2023-11-03T07:15:54] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes
[2023-11-03T07:17:40] Face de Pin Suc√©: Maybe EBMX X9000 but for 500A+ battery, I don't think there's anything else than C1000 for Surron
[2023-11-03T07:27:10] haku: that surron looks really good bud. what motor is on it?
[2023-11-03T07:30:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: For now it's stock motor
[2023-11-03T07:34:01] haku: @PaoloWu you sure this can spot .2 cu + .2 nickel?
[2023-11-03T07:34:48] haku: this is the best price i found for it. how can you tell if authentic?
[2023-11-03T07:41:43] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes the glitter is really nice
[2023-11-03T07:42:11] Face de Pin Suc√©: But be careful of assembly, we saw one with 2 capas unsoldered by factory
[2023-11-03T07:44:54] haku: thanks. my options are this model or kweld. the thing with kweld there are so many accessories needed to spot weld copper. is this model pretty good?
[2023-11-03T07:47:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes it is, but go for the biggest wires 50mm¬≤ if I remember correctly
[2023-11-03T07:47:31] haku: got it. thank you so much!
[2023-11-03T07:49:57] Happy Giraffe: What sort of outlets you have, this at 110v might pull a ginormous current of wall
[2023-11-03T07:51:35] haku: 220 and 110. but glitter only has 110 option for US plug
[2023-11-03T07:56:27] Face de Pin Suc√©: It has supercaps
[2023-11-03T07:57:08] haku: is this a sunnko rebrand or is it a different company?
[2023-11-03T08:01:29] haku: thanks guys i will watch reviews.
[2023-11-03T08:25:18] haku: https://youtube.com/shorts/M22SIZ1OIhI?si=dpsSAzcNcbFMw4ZQ
[2023-11-03T08:25:19] haku: it be so easy to build a frame with tech like this lol
[2023-11-03T08:38:58] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, I wanna see the weld strenght at hydraulic press
[2023-11-03T09:32:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: No you don't üòÇ
[2023-11-03T09:52:21] Pablo Fernandez: Dont think you even need a press
[2023-11-03T10:00:49] Happy Giraffe: I know some proper laser machines but they cost like 50k‚Ç¨ and require more skill than hot glue
[2023-11-03T10:03:21] Unknown: I wish I was in the area
[2023-11-03T10:16:55] Mirono escooters: No penetration at all

[2023-11-03T12:04:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes

[2023-11-03T13:28:09] eriickk_05: hello, I am new to vesc and I would like to learn a little about it. I have thought a project with flipsky 75100 controllers but I do not find specific information about these controllers, do you know if they are compatible with field weakening and how many volts and amperes maximum withstand?
[2023-11-03T13:28:28] Mirono escooters: Any vesc can do fw
[2023-11-03T13:28:37] Mirono escooters: The specs are listed on flipsky site

[2023-11-03T16:36:43] Mirono escooters: <video_file>
[2023-11-03T16:47:02] Gabe Enzo: I hear tubeless is bad and good
[2023-11-03T16:47:05] Gabe Enzo: it weighs more right
[2023-11-03T16:47:14] Gabe Enzo: Also that it's less efficient
[2023-11-03T16:48:20] Mirono escooters: Doesn't matter
[2023-11-03T16:48:24] Mirono escooters: I just need to get the bead to seat
[2023-11-03T16:52:19] puneDir: it doesnt burn with that current?
[2023-11-03T16:52:54] Mirono escooters: I'm lightweight and peaks
[2023-11-03T16:53:03] Mirono escooters: Motor did not go over 35* +- outside with 20mins good riding
[2023-11-03T16:53:03] Gabe Enzo: It won't burn. for a month.
[2023-11-03T16:53:09] Gabe Enzo: that's how it always is
[2023-11-03T16:53:13] Gabe Enzo: n they take it so well during use
[2023-11-03T16:53:16] Mirono escooters: Nah, I actually know what my motors handle and treat em properly
[2023-11-03T16:53:48] Gabe Enzo: > I know what my motors handle > 3kw in 300w.
[2023-11-03T16:53:50] Gabe Enzo: literally me.
[2023-11-03T16:53:55] Gabe Enzo: Just kidding
[2023-11-03T16:55:02] Mirono escooters: I ferrofluided it and I'm monitoring it
[2023-11-03T16:55:10] Mirono escooters: I'm pretty sure I'm not burning this, and know what I do
[2023-11-03T16:56:05] Mirono escooters: Time to open scooter. Again.
[2023-11-03T16:56:11] Gabe Enzo: oops
[2023-11-03T16:56:13] Gabe Enzo: rip threads
[2023-11-03T16:56:30] Mirono escooters: M4
[2023-11-03T16:57:09] Gabe Enzo: I killed my whole frame because I drilled with a regular bit thinking it'll take screws
[2023-11-03T16:57:14] Gabe Enzo: for M4 lol
[2023-11-03T16:57:27] Gabe Enzo: now I'm using another scratched frame
[2023-11-03T17:06:26] Mirono escooters: Wtf was the logic there

[2023-11-03T17:24:40] Mirono escooters: G30 tire
[2023-11-03T17:24:45] Mirono escooters: I can't get the tubeless to seat
[2023-11-03T17:24:53] Face de Pin Suc√©: Rip
[2023-11-03T17:25:03] Mirono escooters: So I used tubed but that wasn't my most genius plan
[2023-11-03T17:25:28] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-11-03T17:26:45] Gabe Enzo: I just assumed it makes grooves when you screw it in
[2023-11-03T17:27:01] Gabe Enzo: accurate representation of me sleep deprived.
[2023-11-03T17:27:08] Mirono escooters: Oh god
[2023-11-03T17:55:43] Jhinzuo ~~: I got mine to seat bro
[2023-11-03T17:56:05] Mirono escooters: How
[2023-11-03T17:56:11] Jhinzuo ~~: It was a pain and it's fully pumped up since 5day no air loss
[2023-11-03T17:56:22] Jhinzuo ~~: Ratchet strap and air compressor
[2023-11-03T17:56:31] Mirono escooters: Yah that it's a pain I know
[2023-11-03T17:56:35] Mirono escooters: I can't succeed
[2023-11-03T17:56:36] Jhinzuo ~~: And added lil slime before
[2023-11-03T17:56:41] Mirono escooters: And I don't understand how the ratchet strap helps
[2023-11-03T17:56:55] Jhinzuo ~~: They're is certain way that works only
[2023-11-03T17:57:37] Jhinzuo ~~: You have to find the spot leaking air and put the metal of the strap right above that
[2023-11-03T17:57:47] Mirono escooters: It leaks everywhere
[2023-11-03T17:58:04] Jhinzuo ~~: And then it starts seeling as soon as some pressure starts building
[2023-11-03T17:58:08] Mirono escooters: It's a shitty tire and a shitty tubeless method This cant be how the engineers wanted it
[2023-11-03T17:58:12] Jhinzuo ~~: U need slime that was the key for me
[2023-11-03T17:58:17] Mirono escooters: I'll try that
[2023-11-03T17:58:43] Jhinzuo ~~: I tried everything and only slime plus ratschetstrap and compressor from fuel station
[2023-11-03T17:58:48] Jhinzuo ~~: With flattyre option
[2023-11-03T17:59:02] Jhinzuo ~~: Took me 1month to do
[2023-11-03T17:59:22] Jhinzuo ~~: I also had so sand the rim where the bead goes
[2023-11-03T17:59:50] Mirono escooters: Fuel station compressor is pulsed üíÄ
[2023-11-03T18:00:00] Jhinzuo ~~: That worked tho
[2023-11-03T18:00:05] Jhinzuo ~~: Pushing more an more
[2023-11-03T18:00:12] Mirono escooters: Mine pushed shit
[2023-11-03T18:00:21] Mirono escooters: I think I push more air farting
[2023-11-03T18:00:28] Jhinzuo ~~: It pushes 5.5bar the gas station one
[2023-11-03T18:00:30] Mirono escooters: I'm not gonna spend another few bucks xD
[2023-11-03T18:00:35] Gabe Enzo: Lol I remember I tried slime and it exploded and sprayed into my eyes
[2023-11-03T18:00:40] Jhinzuo ~~: In Germany it's free on every gas station
[2023-11-03T18:00:49] Mirono escooters: Welp, we want money
[2023-11-03T18:00:49] Jhinzuo ~~: Happend to me too xddd
[2023-11-03T18:01:11] Jhinzuo ~~: The air hose flew off and I made huge line on parking lot xdd
[2023-11-03T18:01:20] Jhinzuo ~~: Sad no tireshop around that would help ?
[2023-11-03T18:07:46] haku: best throttle imo

[2023-11-03T19:00:05] Happy Giraffe: Put a sensor, so nice for measuring
[2023-11-03T19:00:26] Gabe Enzo: It's physically impossible those cells should've blown up
[2023-11-03T19:00:26] Gabe Enzo: what
[2023-11-03T19:00:34] Gabe Enzo: they were mashed into that box

[2023-11-03T19:01:42] Mirono escooters: No, but they shouldn't blow up like that

[2023-11-03T19:10:17] Mirono escooters: Wrong script I guess
[2023-11-03T19:10:26] sombre_enfant: Use 6.05 for this one
[2023-11-03T19:10:40] puneDir: lemme update
[2023-11-03T19:10:40] Mirono escooters: 6.05 gang

[2023-11-03T19:15:03] Mirono escooters: De fok
[2023-11-03T19:16:20] Jhinzuo ~~: Use 6.05
[2023-11-03T19:16:31] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Also, I know most of you are not familiar with GitHub but there are something called "Branches". main = 6.02 VESC (ONLY!) 6_05_adc = 6.05 BETA VESC (ONLY!) If you match something else, you are going to get errors about malformed tokens or anything else. My script is tested and runs, when it does not run YOU ARE doing something wrong. This means EVERYTIME someone tells me something is not working I have to KNOW which VESC firmware, which script (THE URL!!) and not just "not working".
[2023-11-03T19:17:15] puneDir: sorry
[2023-11-03T19:17:30] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Oh and the video that showcases on how to use my script is ONLY for 6.05. The part with ADC is NOT to be used on 6.02 and you should disable the ADC app instead.
[2023-11-03T19:17:58] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: I should update the README at least, but I feel like people aint reading that as well so eh ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

[2023-11-03T19:24:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes always useful
[2023-11-03T19:25:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Did you remove the core before pump the air?
[2023-11-03T19:25:54] Mirono escooters: I tried with and without core

[2023-11-03T19:30:53] Mirono escooters: Air condenser?
[2023-11-03T19:31:01] Mirono escooters: Eh tomorrow get compressor I need for school project anyway
[2023-11-03T19:31:03] Mirono escooters: Winwin
[2023-11-03T19:32:26] Happy Giraffe: Why need that?üò≥
[2023-11-03T19:32:32] Mirono escooters: Tubeless
[2023-11-03T19:37:43] haku: why is most aftermarket motors still use tubes? i cannot find a tubeless version.
[2023-11-03T19:37:48] Gabe Enzo: If you ever have an electrical project just bring your scooter to uni
[2023-11-03T19:37:55] Gabe Enzo: Huh? motors don't come with anything
[2023-11-03T19:38:14] Gabe Enzo: don't you buy separate
[2023-11-03T19:39:44] haku: <photos/photo_10715@03-11-2023_19-39-44.jpg>
[2023-11-03T19:39:50] haku: i mean these motors
[2023-11-03T19:40:16] haku: i cant find a tubeless version.
[2023-11-03T19:41:43] haku: i would think with so much torque with these motors it will rip the valve
[2023-11-03T19:43:53] Mirono escooters: Simpler
[2023-11-03T19:43:55] Mirono escooters: Split rim
[2023-11-03T19:44:16] Mirono escooters: I know who is at university I do not trust them with it
[2023-11-03T19:45:25] haku: got it. i like the simplicity of installing split rims but with motors like these would it be better to have tubeless. much safer imo
[2023-11-03T19:49:40] Unknown: Remove the valve to allow more airflow into the tire. The Rachet strap goes around the circumference of the threads to allow the sidewalks to expand and allow the tire to seat. Some soap and water will allow help. If you want to make your life easier then buy a bazooka. It takes patience, trial & error with a little luck. I‚Äôll find the bazooka and post the link. I used to be a Dualtron tech for a few minimotors dealers and I learned that it takes around 150 psi @ high pressure to seat an 11‚Äù tire
[2023-11-03T19:50:14] Mirono escooters: It takes so much pressure, it's crazy
[2023-11-03T19:52:47] haku: yea when i took mine to a tire shop. you will hear a little pop once they seat it.
[2023-11-03T19:53:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: It exist , it‚Äôs split rim
[2023-11-03T19:53:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: <photos/photo_10716@03-11-2023_19-53-51.jpg>
[2023-11-03T19:53:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: This one + tubeless rim
[2023-11-03T19:55:00] haku: ahh ok. makes sense. thank you
[2023-11-03T19:55:06] Unknown: https://www.nationaltoolwarehouse.com/BEAD-BAZOOKA-Gen-2-P343668.aspx
[2023-11-03T19:55:55] haku: i did not know the detach like that
[2023-11-03T19:56:56] Unknown: For some strange reason I can‚Äôt post a link from amazon because I have a business account but basically this it. They‚Äôre cheaper ones but I can‚Äôt say
[2023-11-03T19:57:21] Happy Giraffe: Oh, but you only have to seal the tire? Why need another pump?
[2023-11-03T19:57:41] Mirono escooters: More oempf
[2023-11-03T19:58:01] Mirono escooters: 300‚Ç¨ oemfp
[2023-11-03T19:59:49] Unknown: Yes 300 but if you‚Äôre charging $50 labor for a tire change then ü§©
[2023-11-03T20:00:33] Unknown: Tools make your life so much easier
[2023-11-03T20:00:37] haku: cheaper way is to talk straight to the employee in the garage and tip them 20bucks
[2023-11-03T20:00:51] haku: thats what i did lol
[2023-11-03T20:01:32] Unknown: Do that 15 times
[2023-11-03T20:01:35] haku: it depends on the tire shop employees tho. this guy was cool and very intrested in scooters.
[2023-11-03T20:02:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: This also works
[2023-11-03T20:03:53] Mirono escooters: Let's just hope a 8bar 30L compressor can
[2023-11-03T20:04:07] Mirono escooters: I tried with Xiaomi pump and sealant, it's clear where it leaks, but there's too much leaks to stop
[2023-11-03T20:04:32] Unknown: The bead blaster works by shooting air from the side while your inflating with a pump
[2023-11-03T20:05:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: Don‚Äôt depends much by total L
[2023-11-03T20:05:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs more about L/min
[2023-11-03T20:06:21] Unknown: Did you remove the valve? I basically use that pump for every single tire. Once or twice I might have a tire that won‚Äôt seat
[2023-11-03T20:06:39] Mirono escooters: Yes valve gone
[2023-11-03T20:06:47] Mirono escooters: It just doesn't seal good. Slime is in too
[2023-11-03T20:06:53] Mirono escooters: 180
[2023-11-03T20:07:11] Mirono escooters: Wtf xD
[2023-11-03T20:07:31] Unknown: Give the slime a little time to harden up a bit
[2023-11-03T20:07:54] Mirono escooters: Shouldn't it stay soft
[2023-11-03T20:08:03] Mirono escooters: I was sitting there for minutes haha It's just leaking
[2023-11-03T20:09:30] haku: use a bead sealant. its messy but that also did the trick for one of my rims
[2023-11-03T20:09:48] Unknown: Whenever air hits it it starts activating. Learnt of slime in my landscaping days. Damn bobcat had a flat every morning
[2023-11-03T20:10:35] Mirono escooters: Aah xD
[2023-11-03T20:10:46] Mirono escooters: The wrap said slime stays liquidi

[2023-11-03T20:11:53] Gabe Enzo: hmm?
[2023-11-03T20:12:10] Gabe Enzo: Do you have battery bar data?
[2023-11-03T20:12:10] Mirono escooters: Isn't there air also inside? Or it sucks up the moisture
[2023-11-03T20:12:16] puneDir: Yes
[2023-11-03T20:12:21] Gabe Enzo: Ah, I didn't.
[2023-11-03T20:12:30] Unknown: Did you run motor config?
[2023-11-03T20:12:37] Gabe Enzo: The motor turned out to be burned.
[2023-11-03T20:12:42] Gabe Enzo: Second 300w I've burned
[2023-11-03T20:12:54] Gabe Enzo: still doesn't explain why the lisp didn't show battery bar data tho.

[2023-11-03T20:15:10] Gabe Enzo: 6.02 doesn't need adc configuration. do you mean configuring the Actual lisp code?
[2023-11-03T20:15:47] Mirono escooters: No, configuring your batt in vesc lol
[2023-11-03T20:15:52] Mirono escooters: Sad day

[2023-11-03T20:43:55] Mirono escooters: BUT NOT DUAL
[2023-11-03T20:44:00] Mirono escooters: No, that's 6.02

[2023-11-03T20:44:44] Gabe Enzo: or that
[2023-11-03T20:44:52] Mirono escooters: I don't think it exists for g30 tho? Idk. Brain dead
[2023-11-03T20:45:35] puneDir: can we somehow remix the xiaomi code to work with g30
[2023-11-03T20:46:50] Gabe Enzo: Where can I find 6.05 vesc firmware? it's not pre loaded and neither can I find it online on any Vedder Forum etc.
[2023-11-03T20:47:06] Gabe Enzo: I can only choose from 3.0->6.02 on vesc tool.
[2023-11-03T20:48:19] Mirono escooters: You use the beta flasher and... Flash
[2023-11-03T20:48:35] Gabe Enzo: does the beta flasher have no limits?
[2023-11-03T20:48:39] Gabe Enzo: HW
[2023-11-03T20:48:42] puneDir: cengiz is flashing ximi fw to g30 dash with stlink
[2023-11-03T20:48:44] puneDir: hope it works
[2023-11-03T20:49:08] Gabe Enzo: Uhhh it should I suppose

[2023-11-03T20:49:30] puneDir: nah its my scoot
[2023-11-03T20:49:42] Gabe Enzo: would that even work?
[2023-11-03T20:49:46] puneDir: yes
[2023-11-03T20:49:54] puneDir: it makes 170 on air with 35a fwk
[2023-11-03T20:50:09] Gabe Enzo: what's fwk
[2023-11-03T20:50:15] Gabe Enzo: not field weakening no?
[2023-11-03T20:51:00] puneDir: field weakening

[2023-11-03T21:57:28] koxx / Francois Deslandes: what kind of bug ? riding it every day üòÅ
[2023-11-03T21:58:32] Thierry: Mainly related to lisp
[2023-11-03T21:59:03] Gabe Enzo: If 6.05 and 6.02 doesn't work then nothing works
[2023-11-03T21:59:14] Gabe Enzo: 6.02 doesn't work at all
[2023-11-03T21:59:23] Gabe Enzo: 6.05 has issues so it has to be used
[2023-11-03T21:59:32] Thierry: No issue on my side with 6.02
[2023-11-03T21:59:42] koxx / Francois Deslandes: and if you encounter bugs, the goal of open source is either fixing it yourself, or talk/explain it with devs. benjamin fix my last issue with ebrake after some talks.
[2023-11-03T21:59:57] haku: do you guys recommend 6.05 over 6.02?
[2023-11-03T22:00:14] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-11-03T22:00:24] puneDir: maybe 80 on road
[2023-11-03T22:00:33] Thierry: Seems that vesc firmware issues are also related to hw and use
[2023-11-03T22:00:41] Mirono escooters: Yes, ofcourse
[2023-11-03T22:00:53] Thierry: No as it is still beta
[2023-11-03T22:00:55] puneDir: gps test will be out tomorrow
[2023-11-03T22:00:59] haku: how is 6.05 with spintend 100/100 v2?
[2023-11-03T22:01:45] koxx / Francois Deslandes: i don't know for this one, but perfect for ubox 75/100 dual
[2023-11-03T22:01:57] haku: i will wait then till its been tested well.
[2023-11-03T22:02:39] haku: im new to vesc so i just go with recomendations
[2023-11-03T22:07:39] koxx / Francois Deslandes: by the way, if you want to talk Benjamin Vedder (vesc original creator) or other devs : https://discord.com/invite/DaD2MTr3
[2023-11-03T22:08:38] Happy Giraffe: Is 6.05 beta better than 6.02?ü§î
[2023-11-03T22:10:14] koxx / Francois Deslandes: for me, yes. look at the change log. a lot of fixes... and also new features (especially with lisp). the goal remains to improve the firmware üòâ
[2023-11-03T22:11:04] Mirono escooters: <photos/photo_10720@03-11-2023_22-11-04.jpg>

[2023-11-03T22:12:33] haku: i cannot contribute to the community yet. i will just be quiet and listen.
[2023-11-03T22:13:21] koxx / Francois Deslandes: ahahha. you have be MUCH MORE precise when you describe a problem on the Discord than here, if not, you'll quickly be discarded. nothing comparable to here üòÅ
[2023-11-03T22:14:10] haku: i will not spam booty shots. i promise
[2023-11-03T22:14:42] Mirono escooters: Good

[2023-11-03T22:22:11] Happy Giraffe: Hall sensors improvements: Smooth transition to sensorless. Bug fix in interpolation. Use less noisy speed estimator for interpolation. Added soft regen cutoff
[2023-11-03T22:23:00] Happy Giraffe: Seems nice, does anybody know what interpolation is? In halls and FOC? Explained very vague on vesc app
[2023-11-03T22:25:29] Thierry: Just did it üëå

[2023-11-04T12:03:22] Mirono escooters: Oh god
[2023-11-04T12:42:00] Gabe Enzo: Can high resistance due to multiple solder points and multiple gold plug points be the cause of improper motor functioning?
[2023-11-04T12:42:12] Mirono escooters: Yes hahaha
[2023-11-04T12:42:16] Gabe Enzo: Like, the cause for vesc not being able to turn a motor properly?,
[2023-11-04T12:42:19] Gabe Enzo: bruh
[2023-11-04T12:42:26] Mirono escooters: Look at my example
[2023-11-04T12:42:30] Mirono escooters: Flipsky misread
[2023-11-04T12:42:35] Mirono escooters: Motor para fucked No good drive
[2023-11-04T12:42:39] Gabe Enzo: Then there's a chance the other motor I threw out wasn't even broken

[2023-11-04T12:42:54] Mirono escooters: You 2..
[2023-11-04T12:43:04] Gabe Enzo: I only recently learned that resistance is the inverse of what I thought it was
[2023-11-04T12:43:11] puneDir: cmon
[2023-11-04T12:43:15] Gabe Enzo: No he's right
[2023-11-04T12:43:24] puneDir: we fucking made 98 with g30 motor
[2023-11-04T12:43:41] Mirono escooters: I'm not in the mood You cant deny you 2 are special

[2023-11-04T12:46:37] Mirono escooters: My flipsky couldn't detect motor para good So I had to manually tune
[2023-11-04T12:46:38] puneDir: i wonder why mosfets burned
[2023-11-04T12:46:40] Mirono escooters: It makes a diff

[2023-11-04T12:48:25] puneDir: i guess you forget were running with g30 motor
[2023-11-04T12:48:34] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse I didnt
[2023-11-04T12:48:40] Mirono escooters: I'm surprised it didn't burn first.

[2023-11-04T13:52:34] Mirono escooters: In my opinion 90a fwk into yours isn't smart But monitor temps and short runs I guess
[2023-11-04T13:52:57] Mirko Boni: Exactly.. I have the temperature sensor
[2023-11-04T13:53:59] Simone: yes, of course, we are testing some 75100.......(50‚Ç¨) .... we put inside 200A with some ventilation, work great

[2023-11-04T14:57:50] Mirono escooters: That's why I say 90a fwk is stupid hahaha
[2023-11-04T14:57:52] Mirono escooters: But no one listen
[2023-11-04T14:57:54] Mirko Boni: Yess

[2023-11-04T15:01:34] Happy Giraffe: And for summer will create aluminium box instead of 3D printed
[2023-11-04T15:01:38] Mirko Boni: Ah ah ah ah ah.. No, in Sardinia today it is 25C
[2023-11-04T15:02:17] Happy Giraffe: How much does the bike weight?
[2023-11-04T15:02:17] Mirko Boni: What temperature do you reach in summer?

[2023-11-04T15:04:53] Happy Giraffe: Yeah battery box made of 3mm aluminium. Next battery will weigh 7kg more and box will be bigger so maybe 10kg more incomingüòÇ
[2023-11-04T15:05:57] Mirko Boni: It might look like a tank üòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-11-04T15:06:35] Happy Giraffe: Needs to be for the thieves, I got a lock on the box
[2023-11-04T15:10:36] Mirko Boni: Are there many thieves in your place?
[2023-11-04T15:20:06] Happy Giraffe: Not that many but opportunity creates them
[2023-11-04T15:44:55] puneDir: Which fet 75100 has
[2023-11-04T15:47:59] Mirko Boni: Exactly
[2023-11-04T17:28:16] Davide: Hi guys, I would like to make the disconnection of the motors on my vsett10+ easier, with external quick-release water-resistant connectors, could you point me to someone?
[2023-11-04T17:29:47] haku: like a ebike?
[2023-11-04T17:30:55] puneDir: Why you want it
[2023-11-04T17:31:09] Davide: my vsett is stock power
[2023-11-04T17:32:42] Pablo Fernandez: When you change the tubes on the vsett 10 you understand why. When i get a flat i take It to the shop, 15$ is better than fucking up my back
[2023-11-04T17:32:47] Davide: to eliminate the yellow boxes that connect the engines to the control unit, and make it easier to disconnect the engines for maintenance work such as changing tires or other
[2023-11-04T17:34:02] Davide: I have to put a bigger battery so I try to make more space in the deck
[2023-11-04T17:39:44] Davide: the price is important üòÜ
[2023-11-04T17:56:01] haku: <photos/photo_10737@04-11-2023_17-56-01.jpg>
[2023-11-04T17:56:34] haku: use these instead.
[2023-11-04T17:57:32] Davide: but i cant use outside the deck cuze they arent waterproof
[2023-11-04T17:58:00] Davide: maybe i make them waterproof.. i dont know
[2023-11-04T17:58:28] Mirono escooters: Yes! The conical ones are better then spring ones
[2023-11-04T17:58:41] Mirono escooters: More surface area
[2023-11-04T18:08:31] haku: do vsetts come with these same yellow boxes?
[2023-11-04T18:10:26] haku: never opened mine. just wondering so i can change it
[2023-11-04T18:31:36] Happy Giraffe: Use Hi-Go hall sensor plug and then xt150 connectors with some waterproofing method like silicone around it
[2023-11-04T18:32:22] Happy Giraffe: Or TPU 3D printed enclosure and having cables in a sagging way that water stays below cable intake(thats also silicone sealed)
[2023-11-04T19:33:17] Mirono escooters: Wich sus is that
[2023-11-04T19:42:09] haku: no idea but it looks cool.

[2023-11-05T19:23:44] KierreKikkeli: Cant also pass registering or insurance check with wrong ones
[2023-11-05T19:23:45] puneDir: turkish police dont care scooters
[2023-11-05T19:23:47] KierreKikkeli: Major pain
[2023-11-05T19:24:16] KierreKikkeli: Here they held a full 2 week stop and check up for all of em to see if they are legal ü§£
[2023-11-05T19:25:05] KierreKikkeli: Like imagine going around on your stock scoot to get pulled over by the popo for vehicle inspection
[2023-11-05T19:25:05] Mirono escooters: He doesn't listen lmao
[2023-11-05T19:25:31] Mirono escooters: If you aren't driving like a inbred you won't get pulled over
[2023-11-05T19:25:34] KierreKikkeli: Many friends been fined for em since 2015

[2023-11-05T19:30:56] puneDir: with good turkish cells (aspilsan)
[2023-11-05T19:31:16] Gabe Enzo: Large wildman can easily fit 20s3p
[2023-11-05T19:31:24] Gabe Enzo: 20s8p
[2023-11-05T19:31:26] Gabe Enzo: together
[2023-11-05T19:31:30] Gabe Enzo: inside can hold 20s5p
[2023-11-05T19:31:38] Mirono escooters: Well, make inside first
[2023-11-05T19:31:52] Gabe Enzo: True, I could buy one and then add on the other later on.
[2023-11-05T19:31:55] Gabe Enzo: Lmao good idea

[2023-11-05T19:32:05] KierreKikkeli: Fit em into 2 wildmans and connect em via some wire or something ü§£
[2023-11-05T19:32:09] Gabe Enzo: how much is in that?
[2023-11-05T19:32:09] puneDir: my external 20s4p

[2023-11-05T19:32:55] Gabe Enzo: as long as mah and discharge is identical
[2023-11-05T19:32:56] Mirono escooters: That doesn't look fun to build
[2023-11-05T19:33:02] puneDir: Yes he said same üòÅ
[2023-11-05T19:33:02] Mirono escooters: Match it
[2023-11-05T19:33:10] Gabe Enzo: Wym
[2023-11-05T19:33:16] Gabe Enzo: That I need the same ones?
[2023-11-05T19:33:17] puneDir: But he also said its the best battery i've ever builded
[2023-11-05T19:33:22] Mirono escooters: No way id build that
[2023-11-05T19:33:24] Mirono escooters: Or good cash my way
[2023-11-05T19:33:29] Mirono escooters: You?
[2023-11-05T19:33:37] puneDir: No cengiz
[2023-11-05T19:33:48] puneDir: he didnt charged me :)

[2023-11-05T19:35:24] puneDir: actually im 16 but 2 months left to 17
[2023-11-05T19:35:40] Mirono escooters: Problably the youngest
[2023-11-05T19:35:47] Gabe Enzo: What

[2023-11-05T19:49:37] Gabe Enzo: OG.
[2023-11-05T19:49:58] Mirono escooters: Yeh
[2023-11-05T19:50:11] Mirono escooters: When I was here the first time, we had 32 members
[2023-11-05T19:50:21] Gabe Enzo: What about m365 chat?
[2023-11-05T19:50:33] Mirono escooters: Uhm, a few months before this
[2023-11-05T19:50:50] Mirono escooters: I got acces to this group because I donated to someone good and uh, idk
[2023-11-05T22:07:18] haku: is this big 11.11 sale worth waiting on?
[2023-11-05T22:08:26] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-11-05T22:09:03] Konstantin: Now, make from lan cable new;))) but a little tricky to install, but fast cat/resoldering them ;)
[2023-11-05T22:09:05] haku: great!
[2023-11-05T22:10:22] Konstantin: It's possible...1 case was, when phase wire cut...and battery voltage trip to hall signals ;). Often, if only fets die, mcu survive
[2023-11-05T22:10:52] Konstantin: So small spot welder ;)))
[2023-11-05T22:11:19] Konstantin: Today was work on old project ;)
[2023-11-05T22:12:50] Konstantin: 20kg mb 22kg trans xD ... Primary pure copper xD secondary aluminum. Will test, but not soon, how it will working))
[2023-11-05T22:14:51] haku: wtf is that? spot welder?
[2023-11-05T22:15:25] haku: wow
[2023-11-05T22:15:34] Konstantin: Y ;) monster ;)))
[2023-11-05T22:15:49] Mirono escooters: You are so cool
[2023-11-05T22:16:40] haku: home made! thats crazy dude. can it spot .2 copper?
[2023-11-05T22:16:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: The question is how many is nominal house power in Russia?
[2023-11-05T22:17:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: In Italy is like 3kW, and when you use all lights dies
[2023-11-05T22:18:12] Mirono escooters: Hahahaha yes, I'm in workroom from 70', away from house Power wire super thin, lights flicker even with sunkko
[2023-11-05T22:18:29] Konstantin: I'm from blr but usually 16a/40a
[2023-11-05T22:19:36] Mirono escooters: Same as here
[2023-11-05T23:33:14] puneDir: Fuck the box
[2023-11-05T23:33:27] puneDir: Im going to get alupcb
[2023-11-06T01:24:22] Pablo Fernandez: Wonder if any of you guys got a idea of whats wrong. The display turns on but shows battery as 0% even when charged therefore It goes into eco Mode (when low battery). However when It turns on in the video you can see that for a second It goes on X Mode (unlimited speed) and It works fine until the 0% battery pops Up. My Guess is a display malfunction but not sure if It could be controller
[2023-11-06T01:24:26] Pablo Fernandez: <video_file>
[2023-11-06T01:24:47] Pablo Fernandez: Havent changed controllers still stock
[2023-11-06T01:25:00] Pablo Fernandez: <photos/photo_10769@06-11-2023_01-25-00.jpg>
[2023-11-06T01:27:19] Pablo Fernandez: if controllers are fucked instead of modifying the vsett 10 i go 3shul on the nami
[2023-11-06T01:33:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Sorry, but here nobody can help u, we just playing with vesc ;)
[2023-11-06T02:37:09] haku: vesc on a nami would be beastly
[2023-11-06T04:22:38] Rogerio Figueiredo: Hello anyone has pictures of vsett10 motor inside please?
[2023-11-06T05:39:25] haku: is the motor the same as the vsett 9? but just has a bigger rim? or completely different motor?
[2023-11-06T05:42:14] haku: gotcha. thanks
[2023-11-06T07:39:10] Face de Pin Suc√©: This is best idea üòã
[2023-11-06T07:55:04] Happy Giraffe: Best of best is to use credit card on rage-mechanics.com
[2023-11-06T07:55:32] Happy Giraffe: Buy their motor and 3shul
[2023-11-06T09:08:53] Oreo huzky: @SibClimb
[2023-11-06T10:56:15] Rogerio Figueiredo: üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ
[2023-11-06T10:56:27] Rogerio Figueiredo: I want to see the halls board
[2023-11-06T11:04:47] haku: anyone try lipos with vesc? stupid idea but maybe worth doing for speed runs
[2023-11-06T11:05:07] Mirono escooters: I did
[2023-11-06T11:05:11] Mirono escooters: Good power Very scary
[2023-11-06T11:07:31] haku: nice. lipos awsome but kinda dangerous if pushed hard. i will try this someday.
[2023-11-06T11:12:28] francois schempers: buy a lipo bag to be safe
[2023-11-06T11:13:46] Mirono escooters: Yes xd
[2023-11-06T11:13:46] francois schempers: https://a.aliexpress.com/_EzFfbFp
[2023-11-06T11:17:34] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Lipo dangerous and tricky, not sure if that's a good idea
[2023-11-06T11:19:15] Mirono escooters: Mine was fine Lipo is fine, if handled properly
[2023-11-06T11:19:26] Mirono escooters: If only for topspeed runs it makes sense hahaha
[2023-11-06T11:35:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I dont really agree , saw several fire in Airsoft world , How fun is when unused weapon on you back gets on fire üòÖ for zero reason And does are small. This has to be huge. Also near "safe usage" you must understand how amps come from there , let's say
[2023-11-06T11:36:48] Mirono escooters: That's super rare, lipo got safer now
[2023-11-06T11:36:58] Mirono escooters: But not discussion worthy. We will never agree
[2023-11-06T11:40:21] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: We dont need to agree , even a coin has different sides
[2023-11-06T11:43:21] Mirono escooters: Xd
[2023-11-06T11:43:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I dont follow it now ,was interesting when was more close to airsoft but to be honest
[2023-11-06T11:44:48] Mirono escooters: Now I see it as safe enough
[2023-11-06T11:45:11] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: The way they are used there is stupid could be lion ,so tech not best ,while if you have gas powered weapons, bullet easy goes under skin by power if you hit surface like that üòÄ where bone and skin is close ,so kinda glides under ü§£
[2023-11-06T11:46:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So next project lipo based?üòÅ
[2023-11-06T11:56:06] Mirono escooters: Ive already done lipo bike
[2023-11-06T11:56:08] Mirono escooters: But too expensive
[2023-11-06T11:56:14] Mirono escooters: If you sponsor me?
[2023-11-06T11:56:21] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-11-06T12:04:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And where is it now?
[2023-11-06T12:05:13] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Sold it and now rich üòè
[2023-11-06T12:05:22] Mirono escooters: The bike? In a corner The battery died because Daly ü§¢ü§¢
[2023-11-06T12:05:33] Mirono escooters: Hah I o wish
[2023-11-06T12:05:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: You have ppl for that called parents
[2023-11-06T12:06:22] Mirono escooters: They'll be happy if I go ask for 1k+
[2023-11-06T12:06:38] Mirono escooters: Pocket change
[2023-11-06T12:06:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well ,they made this problem for there self
[2023-11-06T12:07:00] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Tell then to dont complain now
[2023-11-06T12:07:03] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: ü§£ü§£
[2023-11-06T12:07:11] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-11-06T12:07:25] Mirono escooters: Let me just silently finish bomber and don't be much problems to them hahahaba
[2023-11-06T12:07:54] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: How that happens?
[2023-11-06T12:08:12] Mirono escooters: Daly only shuts off when every cell is 0.5v
[2023-11-06T12:08:17] Mirono escooters: And it's not configurable like ant or llt
[2023-11-06T12:08:25] Mirono escooters: ü§¢ I got the BMS for free and it still sucked.
[2023-11-06T12:08:30] Mirono escooters: Bye 200‚Ç¨ cells
[2023-11-06T12:11:13] S1m 0n: How do we say in Germany? If you don't want to hear (that Daly is shit), you have to feelüòÑ
[2023-11-06T14:35:06] Mirono escooters: I knew Daly was shit
[2023-11-06T14:35:23] Mirono escooters: But I got it for free I was hoping engineers thought of this But no, what retards.
[2023-11-06T14:35:50] Mirono escooters: O well shit happens
[2023-11-06T14:36:21] Gabe Enzo: No way dude
[2023-11-06T14:36:40] Gabe Enzo: So it's only good as an auxiliary series pack.
[2023-11-06T14:36:46] Gabe Enzo: Thats shit
[2023-11-06T14:46:44] Mirono escooters: I'm not kidding I wish I was.
[2023-11-06T14:46:55] Mirono escooters: Powerwall is it's only useful thing
[2023-11-06T14:47:01] Mirono escooters: Because it's dumb and oversized
[2023-11-06T16:11:05] puneDir: can you mod 75100 alupcb to have ignition?
[2023-11-06T16:13:25] sombre_enfant: Yes
[2023-11-06T16:17:59] puneDir: Any pics or tutorial?
[2023-11-06T16:30:04] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_10770@06-11-2023_16-30-04.jpg>
[2023-11-06T16:35:19] Mirono escooters: Das not alupcb
[2023-11-06T16:35:21] Mirono escooters: But concept same
[2023-11-06T16:43:23] cihan: Does anyone have a chart for max speed - battery current for any motor and weight? I need something rough. I wonder how much current or power I need for 60 km/h.
[2023-11-06T16:44:21] Mirono escooters: You can calculate it if you know a speed and W draw
[2023-11-06T16:44:38] Mirono escooters: 60kmh I'd say 3kw continu +- Really depends on scoot, rider, tires, everything
[2023-11-06T16:47:29] cihan: Thanks, I never thought I needed that much. Air drag increase between 32 and 60 is really really big then. 450W is enough for 32 on plain ground.
[2023-11-06T16:48:57] Mirono escooters: Double speed quadruple power
[2023-11-06T16:50:04] sombre_enfant: <photos/photo_10771@06-11-2023_16-50-04.jpg>
[2023-11-06T16:57:21] cihan: Roughly so but it can be higher or lower at some speed intervals. Once I thought if I should have more series cells for higher speed but I think 5P won't have enough current if I go higher than 14S.
[2023-11-06T16:58:01] sombre_enfant: Dead driver ?
[2023-11-06T16:59:02] Mirono escooters: Depenss on the cells
[2023-11-06T16:59:24] cihan: Maybe you can try to check phase currents, probably one phase doesn't give enough current.
[2023-11-06T16:59:38] Mirono escooters: Oscilloscope time
[2023-11-06T16:59:58] cihan: I'll probably go for 18650 since it's cheap and waste less space between cells.
[2023-11-06T17:00:21] Mirono escooters: Wait till you discover li ion pouch
[2023-11-06T17:00:27] Mirono escooters: Anyway 18650 and current don't go together
[2023-11-06T17:00:35] Mirono escooters: P42a/40t/p45b yes
[2023-11-06T17:00:40] Mirono escooters: Amount of cells matters less then wich cells hahaha
[2023-11-06T17:01:56] cihan: I still don't know how I can use space most efficiently. I don't ride for long distances so cooling is my last concern. I want to tuck up as much cells as I can. I wonder how I can use space most efficiently. Battery can be strange looking thing with long thick strips connecting cells maybe though not ideal.
[2023-11-06T17:02:37] Mirono escooters: No, far from..
[2023-11-06T17:02:41] Mirono escooters: Just use honeycomb
[2023-11-06T17:02:50] sombre_enfant: I dont have
[2023-11-06T17:03:20] Mirono escooters: Then use the vesc tab
[2023-11-06T17:03:57] cihan: What's the highest frequency you have to measure on a controller?
[2023-11-06T17:04:19] Mirono escooters: Depends what you measuring?
[2023-11-06T17:05:55] cihan: I have no idea. I only know that cƒ±ntroller uses 8kHz or 16kHz for phase current.
[2023-11-06T17:06:13] cihan: I wonder if cheap 40-50 MHz handheld oscilloscope is enough
[2023-11-06T17:06:15] sombre_enfant: How do i check, need step by step
[2023-11-06T17:06:34] Mirono escooters: Plenty for most stuff
[2023-11-06T17:06:43] Mirono escooters: But a cheap oscilloscope, bweh
[2023-11-06T17:10:25] cihan: They say dso2512g is good on eevblog for what it costs, doesn't have much bugs like others and manufacturer releases new firmware often to fix reported bugs
[2023-11-06T17:11:00] Mirono escooters: ‚Ç¨?
[2023-11-06T17:11:33] cihan: It was sold for 64 USD on AliExpress with free shipping soon ago.
[2023-11-06T17:11:58] puneDir: Ure lucky
[2023-11-06T17:12:05] cihan: Probably dso2512g is more useful than dpox180h.
[2023-11-06T17:12:05] puneDir: My vesc is in the trash now
[2023-11-06T17:12:29] puneDir: Atleast urs work
[2023-11-06T17:16:24] Jhinzuo ~~: Why üòÇ didn't it got repaired yesterday
[2023-11-06T17:16:46] puneDir: dead again
[2023-11-06T17:16:51] puneDir: shitsky
[2023-11-06T17:18:01] Jhinzuo ~~: Shitsky hold 1day or what
[2023-11-06T17:18:19] puneDir: we pressed to gas and it shut down
[2023-11-06T17:18:30] puneDir: Than its ded
[2023-11-06T17:21:49] puneDir: btw i have 2 75100s that i can sell in turkey for good price
[2023-11-06T17:21:55] puneDir: Theyre both ignition modded

[2023-11-06T17:26:36] puneDir: im going to order alupcb
[2023-11-06T17:26:47] puneDir: i dont want to cengiz work on it anymore
[2023-11-06T17:26:53] puneDir: Otherwise hes gonna kill me
[2023-11-06T17:28:33] puneDir: which mosfets do alupcb use
[2023-11-06T17:34:55] Mirono escooters: Some cheap ones : D
[2023-11-06T17:36:23] puneDir: Are them good
[2023-11-06T17:37:08] Mirono escooters: They work

[2023-11-06T17:50:26] puneDir: If it does im really going to suicide
[2023-11-06T17:53:31] Mirono escooters: Owo
[2023-11-06T17:59:01] NetworkDir: If you use stupid values like 120A phase for 35A b current and 40a fwk Its blow again
[2023-11-06T17:59:19] Mirono escooters: And what does that have to do with it
[2023-11-06T17:59:30] Mirono escooters: I do not see the coorelation
[2023-11-06T17:59:50] puneDir: Nothing will happen to alupcb i hope
[2023-11-06T18:00:57] NetworkDir: Heat
[2023-11-06T18:02:47] Mirono escooters: Rofl
[2023-11-06T18:03:04] Mirono escooters: 120a phase is finr
[2023-11-06T18:03:19] NetworkDir: For 35A battery current?
[2023-11-06T18:03:30] puneDir: Alupcb heats less
[2023-11-06T18:03:33] puneDir: Yes but its dual
[2023-11-06T18:04:04] NetworkDir: Yes but depends mount
[2023-11-06T18:04:08] Mirono escooters: I see nothing wrong?
[2023-11-06T18:04:22] puneDir: I will thermal glue it
[2023-11-06T18:04:24] Mirono escooters: You know phase is a few seconds and doesn't care about batt amps yeah? Or you telling weird stuff again
[2023-11-06T18:04:36] NetworkDir: <sticker>
[2023-11-06T18:04:57] Mirono escooters: Nice argument
[2023-11-06T18:05:43] puneDir: @cihanbozkir
[2023-11-06T18:06:21] cihan: Can you use any vesc controller at max battery voltage or do you need to limit max speed since riding becomes jerky at top speed or for some other reasons?
[2023-11-06T18:06:45] cihan: Yup
[2023-11-06T18:06:49] Mirono escooters: No, its smooth
[2023-11-06T18:06:51] Mirono escooters: Do not worry
[2023-11-06T18:08:31] Mirono escooters: What's even The max anyone tried on 75100alupcb? We know 75100 box is 150a phase 100a batt +- max (if you handle Cooling) But alupcb?
[2023-11-06T18:18:48] puneDir: mines exploded with less
[2023-11-06T18:18:56] puneDir: also it was less than 70c
[2023-11-06T18:23:01] Gabe Enzo: @punedir what wattage was your motor at when your fets exploded
[2023-11-06T18:24:21] puneDir: 3300 ig
[2023-11-06T18:25:09] Gabe Enzo: Isn't the 75100 rated for 7.5kw.
[2023-11-06T18:25:36] Gabe Enzo: That's weird
[2023-11-06T18:27:11] NetworkDir: 7.5kW box version lol
[2023-11-06T18:27:34] NetworkDir: Maybe can handle (for 5sec) but heat fucks mosfets
[2023-11-06T18:33:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: New version with super cheap components
[2023-11-06T18:33:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: They actually use at32 I guess
[2023-11-06T18:34:14] puneDir: where i can find old one
[2023-11-06T18:34:36] puneDir: does it die easily?
[2023-11-06T18:34:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: I don‚Äôt remind more, flipsky should still use st
[2023-11-06T18:34:50] puneDir: at is worse i guess
[2023-11-06T18:34:51] Paolo ‚Å≠: But I don‚Äôt know , I didn‚Äôt buy more
[2023-11-06T18:34:54] puneDir: But how worse
[2023-11-06T18:35:01] NetworkDir: For your current probably no
[2023-11-06T18:35:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: It was already super cheap, they did now against more cheaper
[2023-11-06T18:35:22] puneDir: sad
[2023-11-06T18:35:25] Gabe Enzo: then its improperly rated
[2023-11-06T18:37:21] Mirono escooters: What?
[2023-11-06T18:38:19] Mirono escooters: Just bad luck or skill issue hahaha
[2023-11-06T18:38:32] Mirono escooters: Good I got a stock of old 75100 alupcb
[2023-11-06T18:39:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: It‚Äôs the new stm clone they use
[2023-11-06T18:45:39] Mirono escooters: üò¨
[2023-11-06T18:45:53] puneDir: I guess it wont be a big issue
[2023-11-06T18:48:31] puneDir: If fets are fine
[2023-11-06T18:54:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: They replaced fet too with cheaper one which don‚Äôt has even datasheet
[2023-11-06T18:55:14] Mirono escooters: Lol

[2023-11-06T19:40:18] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Why? First it was burnt by shut off That's known and could be easy avoided Than you change mosfet and it burns You were sure all was fine before powerup ?üòÖ I am not ,to be honest
[2023-11-06T19:45:16] puneDir: No?
[2023-11-06T19:45:28] puneDir: Its not because it turn off?
[2023-11-06T19:47:31] puneDir: Cengiz was going 98 and rear esc burned mosfets Front was still working He also drive with only front for like 8-9 km After we changed fets of that It worked (also some problems on 5v rail but also fixed) And then it worked than i pressed to gas It maded a sound and turned off5v and 3.3v rail is shorting I guess its a trash
[2023-11-06T20:41:55] Mirono escooters: I'm confused too
[2023-11-06T20:49:40] Mirono escooters: What
[2023-11-06T21:23:06] Gabe Enzo: Locked vesc
[2023-11-06T21:24:45] puneDir: just flash it?

[2023-11-06T22:06:36] Mirono escooters: On sale
[2023-11-06T22:06:39] Mirono escooters: Now gone
[2023-11-06T22:06:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: Cheapest I saw was 60
[2023-11-06T22:06:54] Mirono escooters: 110‚Ç¨ for box scam
[2023-11-06T22:07:03] S1m 0n: I saw 88 cheapst, but Not seaeching activ for that
[2023-11-06T22:07:35] Mirono escooters: Was a steal, hence why i got half a closet of vesc now hahaha

[2023-11-06T22:09:12] Mirono escooters: But alupcb makes moe sense
[2023-11-06T22:09:37] Mirono escooters: Or the pro with onoff Has pro version fixed the cutoff issue?

[2023-11-06T22:22:14] haku: can you buy authentic magura brakes on aliexpress?
[2023-11-06T22:22:49] haku: stupid question. but i habe to know
[2023-11-06T22:25:29] haku: or what other options for 4 piston brakes are out there?
[2023-11-06T22:29:05] haku: dam i was hoping for a full aliexpress/bangood build
[2023-11-06T22:30:10] haku: lol. imo amazon just reselling aliexpress stuff but with bezos tax
[2023-11-06T22:32:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: What is the cutoff issue?
[2023-11-06T22:38:59] S1m 0n: When you're driving and the BMS switches off, there's no buffer left to absorb the voltage generated by the still-spinning engine (maybe)
[2023-11-06T22:39:41] Mirono escooters: Shimano ali
[2023-11-06T22:39:56] Mirono escooters: MOSFETs kaput when BMS cut
[2023-11-06T22:40:07] Mirono escooters: Too little components hahaha
[2023-11-06T22:40:20] Mirono escooters: On mos driver
[2023-11-06T22:42:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: That‚Äôs is more or less like every esc, when bms cut
[2023-11-06T22:42:55] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-11-06T22:43:08] Mirono escooters: You accel, BMS cut, mos kaput
[2023-11-06T22:43:17] Mirono escooters: Even most vesc handle ebrake batt cut üíÄ
[2023-11-06T22:45:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Whut
[2023-11-06T22:45:18] Mirono escooters: Are you high? We talked about this for months hahahaa
[2023-11-06T22:45:37] S1m 0n: it depends on the speed. Look at the voltage in the video with the charging function on the BMS deactivated
[2023-11-06T22:46:35] S1m 0n: Its only a 13s system.. Sometimes i saw something around 70V üòÑ
[2023-11-06T22:46:38] Mirono escooters: Ive never had it happen yet
[2023-11-06T22:46:44] Mirono escooters: But my BMS doesn't randomly cut xd
[2023-11-06T22:46:54] S1m 0n: Its Not regen
[2023-11-06T22:47:16] S1m 0n: Every Motor is also Like a Dynamo and every Dynamo Like a Engine
[2023-11-06T22:47:44] S1m 0n: Regen is Just controlled via Software and Controller
[2023-11-06T22:48:01] Mirono escooters: Point is Controller should switch mos off, no issue, freeroll
[2023-11-06T22:48:15] Mirono escooters: But we don't know why But only 75100 does this when BMS cut when accelerating
[2023-11-06T22:48:31] Mirono escooters: But we know they use minimum components so
[2023-11-06T22:48:37] Mirono escooters: It's Problably easy fix but I don't wanna bother
[2023-11-06T22:48:38] S1m 0n: Maybe switchs to slow, Like daly üòÑ
[2023-11-06T22:48:44] Mirono escooters: Hahahahah
[2023-11-06T22:48:48] Mirono escooters: We dont know
[2023-11-06T22:48:53] Mirono escooters: But 60‚Ç¨ Esc I'm not bothering
[2023-11-06T22:48:58] Mirono escooters: And setting limits properly lmao
[2023-11-06T22:49:18] Mirono escooters: The guys that push stupid currents on shitty batts, and then surprise BMS cut and kaput are not my issue
[2023-11-06T22:49:36] S1m 0n: Also true
[2023-11-06T22:50:04] Mirono escooters: 90% of guys here with the issue were just pulling loads of power out of bad packs and surprise it died
[2023-11-06T22:50:12] Mirono escooters: If setup shit, eh. Not my issue
[2023-11-06T22:50:32] S1m 0n: It's cool to push cheap stuff to or beyond its limits, but then you don't have to expect it to last long
[2023-11-06T22:50:35] Mirono escooters: Idk what should happen before my battery decides to shut off, but it's rare Just set limits In Vesc and cheap esc
[2023-11-06T22:50:40] Mirono escooters: Voila
[2023-11-06T22:51:14] francois schempers: to mitigate this you can use a rheostatic brake resistor wired before the battery and will take a hit before the bms does, and dicipate in heat https://a.aliexpress.com/_EHZXdTZ
[2023-11-06T22:51:50] Mirono escooters: But we are talking about accel, not ebrake
[2023-11-06T22:52:46] Mirono escooters: Eh anyway Step 1: set limits according to your stuff Step 2: ??? Step 3: profit
[2023-11-06T22:53:23] francois schempers: yes, but on bms cutoff, the esc still have something to dump into, and may not die immediately
[2023-11-06T22:54:50] Mirono escooters: Eh, if this concerned just buy a more expensive vesc. Fixed
[2023-11-06T22:55:12] Mirono escooters: It's Problably something very simple But I'm not gonna find out how
[2023-11-06T22:56:13] francois schempers: Well, I'm buying 300+‚Ç¨ esc so I hope they can manage that üòÇüòÇ
[2023-11-06T22:56:36] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-11-06T22:56:50] francois schempers: ü§£ü§£ü§£
[2023-11-06T22:56:59] Mirono escooters: Ehn, i think it's just missing a pulldown resistor
[2023-11-06T22:58:21] NetworkDir: My mks at ~5kmh fuse exploded but nothing happened to mosfets Luck or fuse smoothly drop voltage
[2023-11-06T22:59:20] NetworkDir: Lol
[2023-11-06T22:59:25] Mirono escooters: I've asked mxlemming If he don't know, no one know
[2023-11-06T22:59:37] Mirono escooters: Cant we ask the maker on endlesspspjere? I mean, he literally made 75100
[2023-11-06T23:02:42] NetworkDir: Bms when cutting does it cut off the voltage immediately?
[2023-11-06T23:03:02] NetworkDir: Hmm
[2023-11-06T23:03:03] Mirono escooters: What do you mean
[2023-11-06T23:03:12] Mirono escooters: There are a few ms before mos close
[2023-11-06T23:03:25] NetworkDir: I mean after cutting voltage immediately drops to 0V?
[2023-11-06T23:04:05] NetworkDir: After exploding my fuse i see voltage at voltage meter 55 50 30 20 5 0
[2023-11-06T23:06:12] Mirono escooters: No, there are caps
[2023-11-06T23:06:15] Mirono escooters: You have a Few ms
[2023-11-06T23:06:32] Mirono escooters: That is when no power goes through, so caps slowly disch
[2023-11-06T23:06:41] Mirono escooters: But if BMS cuts and you ride, caps drain in ms
[2023-11-06T23:08:10] NetworkDir: Hmm
[2023-11-06T23:19:22] Mirono escooters: From the Lord himself: [11/6, 23:18] mxlemming: weird. [11/6, 23:18] mxlemming: honestly, no idea. This is not normal.
[2023-11-06T23:22:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: What?
[2023-11-06T23:25:13] Mirono escooters: That even the smartest person I know can't seem to find why flipsky does it : D
[2023-11-06T23:26:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Ah it‚Äôs because of the driver
[2023-11-06T23:26:35] Paolo ‚Å≠: It don‚Äôt has under voltage lockout
[2023-11-06T23:26:50] Mirono escooters: But they had same driver as spintend
[2023-11-06T23:26:59] Paolo ‚Å≠: Eg3112?
[2023-11-06T23:27:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: Spintend use Infineon
[2023-11-06T23:27:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: At least on the ubox dual
[2023-11-06T23:27:29] Mirono escooters: Then I'm confused and read it somewhere
[2023-11-06T23:27:35] Mirono escooters: @jamessoderstrom didn't you say dat
[2023-11-06T23:32:38] Mirono escooters: [11/6, 23:31] mxlemming: Is there a UVLO setting on flipsky? [11/6, 23:31] Mirono: Vesc has it, yes [11/6, 23:31] mxlemming : Maybe set that to 40V or whatever
[2023-11-06T23:32:58] Mirono escooters: I get his thinking. Batt cuts, and in the ms power left, vesc shuts off, protecting Still, eh
[2023-11-06T23:33:40] NetworkDir: Maybe flipsky wants to burned vescs for more sells And makerbase want to showing fake currents Lol
[2023-11-06T23:34:29] Mirono escooters: And I'm the pope
[2023-11-06T23:35:14] Mirono escooters: Ok, I'll do it. I'll surrender a vesc for testing and mod it.
[2023-11-06T23:36:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: And someone got already power cut with spintend?
[2023-11-06T23:37:51] Mirono escooters: The UVLO must just not be connected haha
[2023-11-06T23:37:57] Mirono escooters: Oh, wtf, it doesn't have
[2023-11-06T23:39:39] Mirono escooters: Mxlemming isn't too fond of no uvlo mos drivers
[2023-11-06T23:40:18] Mirono escooters: [11/6, 23:37] jb is probably a PTC fuse and the big diode is probably a zener. [11/6, 23:38] : Looks like Spintend might have discovered something about the 12V line
[2023-11-06T23:40:38] Mirono escooters: So uhm, whatever the fix is, it's sketch
[2023-11-06T23:44:40] Mirono escooters: Might be. I had big issues in the past with DCDCs dumping high voltages onto the 12V line, which is why I moved to using isolated dricks
[2023-11-06T23:45:12] Mirono escooters: Tldr: Add a big ass cap on 12v line and pray
[2023-11-07T00:11:09] Mirono escooters: Ofcourse?
[2023-11-07T00:11:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: Driver works at 12v ahahah
[2023-11-07T00:11:50] Mirono escooters: It makes sense Keep the circuit on long enough to A: detect undervolttage ( it'll trip, since you drop to 0v hahahaha) B: turn mos off
[2023-11-07T00:11:53] Mirono escooters: It's a viable solution
[2023-11-07T00:12:26] Mirono escooters: I don't know if I wanna offer up my vesc for it tho.
[2023-11-07T00:14:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: Option 2
[2023-11-07T00:14:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Add a battery to 12v line
[2023-11-07T00:14:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: üòè
[2023-11-07T00:14:35] Mirono escooters: A cap is fine
[2023-11-07T00:14:37] Mirono escooters: üôà
[2023-11-07T00:40:30] haku: i just want to share my aliexpress helmet came today. lol
[2023-11-07T00:41:07] Mirono escooters: If it's actually safe üòâ
[2023-11-07T00:41:30] haku: i know lol. i needed a new one for colder weather
[2023-11-07T00:41:44] haku: i just use a mtb full face.
[2023-11-07T00:45:57] cihan: Can makerbase 75100 v2 survive? And I have another question, excluding higher voltage support, does getting makerbase 75100 v2 makes sense rather than buying makerbase 60100HP?
[2023-11-07T00:57:01] cihan: I didn't check but if I'm not able to tuck more than 13 series inside deck, it can be meaningful for me. They say 13S is safe but it's rated at 60V. So if regenerative braking and BMS charging is set correctly, I think it can be 14S too.
[2023-11-07T01:00:56] cihan: I don't think that I'll ever try to exceed 40A "battery current" on the motor so I think having more series doesn't make sense for me. 13A makes 32km/h at 36V. I don't know at what voltage but 40A seems like can do 50-55. And 52 V is probably enough for 50-55 km/h. So I probably don't need more series cells. Am I wrong about it? And it's a front wheel drive so I'll have a limit for acceleration too.
[2023-11-07T01:01:06] Mirono escooters: <video_file>
[2023-11-07T01:12:01] cihan: Ohh, I was wrong. I just made a simple calculation considering aged cells of 100mOhm resistance, 5 parallel and 14 series. 30A regenerative breaking on front tire causes 8.4V increase at battery terminals. If battery is at 56V without load, it already exceeds 60V when breaking. I didn't think regenerative braking could cause that much voltage increase.
[2023-11-07T01:13:05] cihan: 15A regenerative braking for rear tire is fine, but I'll need double force for front tire.
[2023-11-07T01:13:25] cihan: They will eventually get old some day and reach that value. Unfortunately they do.
[2023-11-07T01:13:35] Mirono escooters: That's trash then
[2023-11-07T01:14:13] cihan: I'm greedy, I can use them till they die on me.)
[2023-11-07T01:14:38] Mirono escooters: Shouldn't go over 60mohm at all imo
[2023-11-07T01:15:21] cihan: I have 400mOhm cells, but I can only charge them manually, no smart charger charges them.)
[2023-11-07T01:15:25] Mirono escooters: Good low esr batt Can take peaks of ebrake fine
[2023-11-07T01:15:33] Mirono escooters: Bro just throw awayüò≠
[2023-11-07T01:15:43] Mirono escooters: My powerwall cells over 100mohm is trash üò≠ and they see 0.5a max
[2023-11-07T01:16:32] cihan: I run clocks with them. They last really long with wall clocks.)
[2023-11-07T01:17:40] cihan: Strangely yes, there are 8-10 at home. My family has a tendancy to hang any clock they have on some walls.)
[2023-11-07T01:18:01] Mirono escooters: Ok this is fair
[2023-11-07T01:19:43] Mirono escooters: Charging no go Using in clock till die, ok
[2023-11-07T01:22:10] cihan: Yes, it's not good for safety. I just didn't want to throw them away. If I consider end of life as 50mOhm, then regenerative braking at 30A, 14S5P, and 56V(%80 charge) battery voltage is 4.2V. It makes 60.2V. Question is can 60100HP handle it or should I stay away from limits?
[2023-11-07T01:24:10] cihan: If I make battery 6P, then it's 3.5V and inside limits. I'm not sure if those limits are very certain limits or loose.

[2023-11-07T02:20:05] Unknown: Help me please. I can‚Äôt run motor detection because I‚Äôm getting motor over temperature
[2023-11-07T03:24:53] haku: the nanrobot L7 scooter. does it have a generic frame that you can purchase in ali?
[2023-11-07T03:29:17] haku: what i meant was is that like a generic frame? like laotie
[2023-11-07T03:44:12] Unknown: Yes. I got it sorted out. I have to change the sensor type
[2023-11-07T04:49:10] francois schempers: the more serie you have, the more efficient your scooter is, higher voltage is better than higher A, it give less heat, let you get higher top speed, there is really no downside aiming for higher V, plus if you say you don't want to use more than 40A then you can use better cells, like p45b use one less parallel and add a few serie
[2023-11-07T06:09:35] puneDir: With fwk it does
[2023-11-07T06:36:15] haku: is that right? a 72v 40a will result with less heat than a 60v 45a setup. i did not know that
[2023-11-07T06:49:56] francois schempers: yes, it's A that make the most heat, that's why power lines are 100k's of volt with low A, so that less is lost to heat the power lost in a cable is P=i^2xR so, the more i (amps) you have, the more loss to heat you get
[2023-11-07T07:14:45] haku: i see. thanks foe the knowledge
[2023-11-07T07:15:38] haku: but what is the benifit of a high Amp battery/controller? faster acceleration?
[2023-11-07T07:21:51] Finn: Yes
[2023-11-07T07:25:28] francois schempers: high Amps means more torque, more than higher voltage, but higher voltage also give more torque, just not that much
[2023-11-07T07:46:45] Happy Giraffe: Spintend BT module range is quite nice, in direct eyesight ~50müòÅ
[2023-11-07T07:50:41] cihan: I think I somehow understood something wrong about battery voltage. I thought controller just controls current and battery voltage is just for overcoming back EMF. How does higher battery voltage make scooter more efficient?
[2023-11-07T07:54:01] cihan: I'm still confused. Is there a transformer inside controller? üßê
[2023-11-07T07:54:17] Mirono escooters: Whot
[2023-11-07T07:55:01] francois schempers: <photos/photo_10779@07-11-2023_07-55-01.jpg>
[2023-11-07T07:55:02] francois schempers: because P=i^2xR and
[2023-11-07T07:55:13] francois schempers: where p is power loss
[2023-11-07T07:55:51] francois schempers: more V or more A means more power loss, but with A the power loss is much higher
[2023-11-07T07:56:47] francois schempers: in simplistic terms yes, mosfet transform dc into 3 ac phase
[2023-11-07T08:02:08] francois schempers: controller will decrease voltage and make higher Amps on phase, that's why phase Amps and battery Amps are not the same, at low speed, controller makes lower voltage phase with much higher Amps, and at top speed, you basically have battery voltage and thus phase Amps = battery Amps this is simplified its a bit more complex, but it's for your understanding
[2023-11-07T08:02:09] cihan: Ahh, controller is an inverter, sorry. Thanks a lot. üôè
[2023-11-07T08:04:02] Gabe Enzo: Controlled variable inverter ya
[2023-11-07T08:04:21] Mirono escooters: And if something fails, uncontrolled : D
[2023-11-07T08:04:47] Gabe Enzo: That can fluctuate Low and high amps and low and high volts
[2023-11-07T08:04:58] Gabe Enzo: So not rly just an inverter
[2023-11-07T08:05:53] cihan: Is phase current always a sine wave? And do you talk about peak to peak of this sine wave when you talk about phase current?
[2023-11-07T08:06:28] Gabe Enzo: Yeah Ac must be sine wave
[2023-11-07T08:06:49] Gabe Enzo: cause each MOSFET row will power up in sequence
[2023-11-07T08:07:42] cihan: So you set battery max current and max phase current individually on vesc, right?
[2023-11-07T08:07:54] Gabe Enzo: Yeah
[2023-11-07T08:07:59] Gabe Enzo: you can set max batt current too.
[2023-11-07T08:10:48] Gabe Enzo: Direct current is literally "direct"
[2023-11-07T08:13:42] cihan: I wonder how it's possible to have 130A phase current with 35A battery current. If max phase voltage is equal to max battery voltage, then max phase current should be like 110A peak to peak.
[2023-11-07T08:14:03] Gabe Enzo: Because it's actually a transformer.
[2023-11-07T08:14:34] Gabe Enzo: You can invariably trade them to one another mathematically
[2023-11-07T08:14:40] Gabe Enzo: They have equating values
[2023-11-07T08:15:31] cihan: So you're not able to reach battery voltage once you set current so high, right? I mean phase voltage will be less than battery voltage.
[2023-11-07T08:18:29] Gabe Enzo: I don't understand your question. Unsure if due to the way you phrased it or if I just lack the knowledge
[2023-11-07T08:21:06] francois schempers: you can have 120A phase at startup and low speed, because you trade voltage for it, once up to speed you don't have that much phase capability anymore
[2023-11-07T08:21:30] francois schempers: <photos/photo_476@30-06-2021_22-32-48.jpg>
[2023-11-07T08:21:33] Mirono escooters: Max speed = max batt v
[2023-11-07T08:25:05] cihan: I wanted to mean average value of phase current will be half of peak but that's still higher than battery current so phase voltage will always be lower than battery voltage if you set current so high.
[2023-11-07T08:25:26] cihan: Phase voltage is never higher than battery voltage, right?
[2023-11-07T08:26:08] francois schempers: not always, depends on how many mosfet and other things, rudimentary esc make more of a square wave, foc is more complex and measure field to input the right amount
[2023-11-07T08:27:26] francois schempers: except in some niche case yes
[2023-11-07T08:28:11] cihan: So do you talk about zero to peak value of phase current when you mention phase current without anything else?
[2023-11-07T08:28:31] cihan: Like adding a DC DC converter? Someone was doing it here.
[2023-11-07T08:32:28] francois schempers: nah like when you go faster than your top speed with field weakening or going down hill and start to brake, controller see higher than battery voltage dc/dc converter would be too wastfull at the load you would use it
[2023-11-07T08:37:07] cihan: Thanks a lot. So if I have 60 cells to utilize, making a battery 20S3P is more beneficial, efficient than making the battery 10S6P even when I don't need high speed, is it so?
[2023-11-07T08:39:00] francois schempers: yes, but be sure to have cells capable of delivering your required Amps, or you'll have big drop in voltage
[2023-11-07T08:40:00] francois schempers: 20s3p of p45b would be good performance, if you use 40T You'll have bigger drops
[2023-11-07T08:40:24] francois schempers: so there is a good in-between value depending on wich cell you have
[2023-11-07T08:53:21] francois schempers: for example, let's say you aim for a speed of 32km/h (max speed at 10s) with 10s6p at 32km/h you'll only have your max battery Amps available for phase Amps, so let's say 40A with 20s3p, since your not at your max speed, controller have more head room to make higher phase Amps, so you could still have something like 60-80 A on phase. there you can see that higher voltage, if you controller can use it efficiently, is always better
[2023-11-07T09:08:11] cihan: Thanks a lot, you cleared up questions in my mind. So the question is why Ninebot insists on 36V battery from very beginning? Because they have no intention to accelerate fast and go fast?
[2023-11-07T09:09:38] francois schempers: because regulations are 25km/h in most countries, so no need to make higher voltage capable product, a 10s bms and 10s esc are cheaper to produce
[2023-11-07T09:38:50] cihan: Spintend suddenly became better choice now after your explanation since it's 100V. üòç
[2023-11-07T09:41:35] francois schempers: much better choice yes ;)
[2023-11-07T09:45:55] cihan: My VESC bill increases with something new I learn each time.))
[2023-11-07T09:50:59] francois schempers: if you have money to spend on scooter, it's first Vesc, then battery accordingly, then a good motor
[2023-11-07T09:53:36] francois schempers: can't do shit without a good esc, can do some even without a good battery, and can do wonders even with a bad motor
[2023-11-07T09:54:25] cihan: I feel like that navee motor will somehow burn eventually.)
[2023-11-07T09:55:18] francois schempers: at higher voltage, not necessarily
[2023-11-07T09:55:49] francois schempers: even the 350w xiaomi motor can take you to good speed with adequate voltage
[2023-11-07T09:57:14] francois schempers: a motor can take 3x-4x its nominal W no problem, and even higher in short burst
[2023-11-07T09:59:24] cihan: I think it won't get damaged easily with 1600W for like 5 minutes run from cold start. That's my usual route. Once I rode f2 pro for 21 km for 10km run-10 min stop - 11 km run. Motor cover was hot to touch when I got back, probably something like 50-60 degrees but nothing happened. Which one usually gets damaged first, magnets or coils?
[2023-11-07T09:59:54] Gabe Enzo: coils.
[2023-11-07T10:00:22] Mirono escooters: Lol depends
[2023-11-07T10:00:37] Gabe Enzo: the coils get hot first.
[2023-11-07T10:00:41] Mirono escooters: If you have nice thermal conductivity to magnets 80* shitty quality magnets
[2023-11-07T10:00:41] Gabe Enzo: magnets later
[2023-11-07T10:00:46] Mirono escooters: Ya but coils handle more bro
[2023-11-07T10:00:49] Mirono escooters: Jezus
[2023-11-07T10:00:51] Gabe Enzo: ah
[2023-11-07T10:00:54] Mirono escooters: 80* cheapest magnets
[2023-11-07T10:00:56] Mirono escooters: 150* enamel
[2023-11-07T10:01:04] Mirono escooters: 120* good neodymium magnets
[2023-11-07T10:01:24] cihan: I read polyimide coil insulation can withstand 250 celcius but I'm not sure if motor manufacturers use it.
[2023-11-07T10:01:28] Gabe Enzo: my winding always burn first
[2023-11-07T10:02:00] Mirono escooters: Skill issue
[2023-11-07T10:02:09] Mirono escooters: It really depends..
[2023-11-07T10:02:28] Mirono escooters: Don't overheat your magnets or demagnetization and kv go up
[2023-11-07T10:02:45] Mirono escooters: Just instlall a temp sensor and ferrofluid
[2023-11-07T10:02:46] Mirono escooters: : D
[2023-11-07T10:03:18] cihan: Ferro fluid makes sense, graphs shared here showed big temperature difference.
[2023-11-07T10:03:25] francois schempers: I regularly get my g2 motor to 150¬∞c x) I'll tell you wich one burn first üòÇüòÇ
[2023-11-07T10:04:02] Mirono escooters: O o
[2023-11-07T10:04:11] Mirono escooters: Is the G2 motor better? It seems, cooler, bit more stronk
[2023-11-07T10:04:16] Mirono escooters: My gen1 goes strong on 3kw hahaha
[2023-11-07T10:04:30] cihan: 3kw for one motor?
[2023-11-07T10:04:54] francois schempers: but fero can be dangerous for magnets too, in my case, stator at 150, magnets not that hot, with ferro I must make sure I don't exceed magnet capacity since more heat is dumped into them
[2023-11-07T10:05:30] francois schempers: in my g2 I have the cfw at 60A + 35A field weakening x)
[2023-11-07T10:06:21] cihan: In fact field weaking is mostly for making motor spin faster at same power in industrial usage as I read.)
[2023-11-07T10:06:29] francois schempers: my next project will have 16kw in one motor üòÇüòÇ
[2023-11-07T10:07:21] cihan: What's top speed without field weakening at 60A and with field weakening?
[2023-11-07T10:07:40] francois schempers: not at same power, you inject A on top of the A you already consume to counter backemf
[2023-11-07T10:08:18] Mirono escooters: But, heat is much more rapid gone
[2023-11-07T10:08:23] francois schempers: I'm heavy, so not that much in my case, I'm at 27km/h without and 35-40 with fw
[2023-11-07T10:08:33] Mirono escooters: Hahaha qs273 on bike takes loads
[2023-11-07T10:09:21] cihan: Wait, I got confused. Does 60A battery current give you 27km/h without field weakening?
[2023-11-07T10:09:32] francois schempers: 60A phase
[2023-11-07T10:09:59] francois schempers: battery barely exceed 30A and 40a when using fw
[2023-11-07T10:10:26] francois schempers: it's stock battery, so only 10s
[2023-11-07T10:10:37] francois schempers: and I'm 140kg x)
[2023-11-07T10:10:40] Mirono escooters: For now ü§≠
[2023-11-07T10:11:51] cihan: I weigh 110 and for me battery current is 12A when I'm going 32 km/h on plain ground. 30A is a lot.
[2023-11-07T10:12:45] francois schempers: Well 30kg is a world of difference ^^ and I like to have torque, so I push it to the limit x)
[2023-11-07T10:17:35] cihan: This is how Xiaodash shows on my f2 pro.
[2023-11-07T10:18:43] cihan: I remembered my speed when climbing an overpass bridge was 18 when going shopping and it was only 12 with 10kg backpack when returning back from shopping.)
[2023-11-07T10:38:11] haku: thanks for lots of explainations. so what would the average top speed of a 72v scooter with a 11" tire?
[2023-11-07T10:38:46] NetworkDir: 80-110km/h
[2023-11-07T10:38:57] NetworkDir: Depends current and motor
[2023-11-07T10:40:57] haku: lets say you can pull 100a per controller of the battery and a 70h motor?
[2023-11-07T10:41:57] haku: in theory what would the top.speed be?
[2023-11-07T10:43:24] haku: with no fw
[2023-11-07T10:43:30] francois schempers: mine, with fw
[2023-11-07T10:44:01] francois schempers: <video_file>
[2023-11-07T10:45:37] francois schempers: did not go to max speed on this run, but you can see I'm already at 38A battery x)
[2023-11-07T10:46:01] francois schempers: max is 44 on stock g2, so I'm nearing the limit x)
[2023-11-07T10:46:49] francois schempers: but the g2 controller is a beast, still 25¬∞c x)
[2023-11-07T10:47:01] haku: this is a stock single motor g2
[2023-11-07T10:47:18] francois schempers: full stock max g2 yes
[2023-11-07T10:47:30] haku: nice!
[2023-11-07T10:48:13] Happy Giraffe: Pls no
[2023-11-07T10:48:39] cihan: I still felt like it consumes a lot of power. Was power consumption similar without VESC? I don't think that 140kg could cause that much power consumption? Can it?
[2023-11-07T10:48:46] francois schempers: Well it dies when it dies x) we will know its limit then üòÇüòÇ
[2023-11-07T10:49:08] francois schempers: it's not Vesc, it's stock esc with custom firmware
[2023-11-07T10:49:09] cihan: Ahh this is not vesc, stock controller
[2023-11-07T10:49:15] Happy Giraffe: QS138
[2023-11-07T10:50:06] Happy Giraffe: You have thermistor inside?
[2023-11-07T10:50:38] cihan: How was power consumption with factory firmware? I still regret I upgraded factory firmware on f2 pro. Max power at max speed was same as now, 900W but factory firmware used certainly more than 900W when accelerating, it was very snappy when it first arrived. I mean upgrading to official firmware 1.4.7 Factory firmware was 1.3.8
[2023-11-07T10:55:18] Oreo huzky: @SibClimb
[2023-11-07T10:55:53] francois schempers: yeah, stock one, on the stator
[2023-11-07T10:56:40] francois schempers: you can flash it with xiaodash now, you just need an stlink ;)
[2023-11-07T10:57:09] francois schempers: a lot lower
[2023-11-07T10:57:36] cihan: Do you think efficiency changed comparing stock firmware?
[2023-11-07T10:58:08] francois schempers: yeah, loosing a lot in heat now since I'm near the hardware limit
[2023-11-07T10:58:15] cihan: I didn't want to open the deck since it's glued there and with 10S battery it's not really worth.
[2023-11-07T10:58:34] francois schempers: Well with fw it's nice
[2023-11-07T10:59:43] cihan: I think I will never want to use field weakening since it decreases efficiency.
[2023-11-07T11:01:57] cihan: Does BMS limit current to 40A?
[2023-11-07T11:02:46] francois schempers: 44A if you have bms coms, 20A without
[2023-11-07T11:02:57] francois schempers: and 44 not continous
[2023-11-07T11:12:06] NetworkDir: 200A 20s Peak power 16.8kW With vesc and fwk Maybe you can reach 110-140kmh Depends driver weight motor kV
[2023-11-07T11:13:08] Finn: Single motor will melt
[2023-11-07T11:13:39] haku: thanks!
[2023-11-07T11:13:56] NetworkDir: Yes
[2023-11-07T11:14:08] NetworkDir: Single for big scooters shitty
[2023-11-07T11:15:15] Oreo huzky: With low kv motors 75h 20s and 300A 50A fw I was able to reach 125kmh
[2023-11-07T11:15:59] Oreo huzky: But that‚Äôs with dual motor
[2023-11-07T11:16:21] NetworkDir: Single?
[2023-11-07T11:16:33] NetworkDir: And driver weight
[2023-11-07T11:17:25] haku: dam im 100kilos.
[2023-11-07T11:17:57] haku: <sticker>
[2023-11-07T11:26:39] Jan: How is everyone here triple digit weight or sub 50kg
[2023-11-07T11:30:40] Finn: I got single with 100A battery and 170A phase ant hit 90kmh gps
[2023-11-07T11:30:54] Finn: The power of 6 mosfet vesc
[2023-11-07T11:31:11] Mirono escooters: 75100 alupcb?
[2023-11-07T11:31:11] Finn: 12 better
[2023-11-07T11:31:17] Mirono escooters: Obv
[2023-11-07T11:31:20] Finn: Ubox 80V 100A
[2023-11-07T11:31:23] Mirono escooters: It's incredible what 6fet do
[2023-11-07T11:31:27] Finn: Yeah
[2023-11-07T11:31:43] Finn: Still 12 better
[2023-11-07T11:36:10] francois schempers: what about 18 üòé
[2023-11-07T11:36:40] haku: the most spintend has is 12 yea?
[2023-11-07T11:37:24] haku: the dual 100/100 how many fets per side?
[2023-11-07T11:38:44] cihan: Is there any controller with 12 mosfets and with reasonable price?
[2023-11-07T11:53:12] Oreo huzky: 66kg
[2023-11-07T11:53:19] Oreo huzky: Dual
[2023-11-07T11:54:35] Mirono escooters: Obviously? üòÇ
[2023-11-07T11:54:53] Mirono escooters: Spintend or makerbase
[2023-11-07T11:56:41] cihan: Which one from makerbase? Spintend 100V 100A has really bad reviews about overheating and one from Izuna. Should I pass it?
[2023-11-07T11:58:58] Mirono escooters: 75200
[2023-11-07T11:59:55] cihan: Some time ago I used to ask about which controller to get but 75100 and 60100HP were recommended against it, I think Elshan and Izuna recommended. What's your opinion?
[2023-11-07T12:00:17] Mirono escooters: If <14s
[2023-11-07T12:02:05] Happy Giraffe: Ninebot has nowadays thermistor?üòÇ
[2023-11-07T12:02:36] francois schempers: g2 have one yes ^^
[2023-11-07T12:03:01] cihan: I still don't know, I need to check inside. But I think I can do more than 13S. 4P can be enough for me, I always aimed for current before, I didn't know how controller worked, I thought battery current had to be same as phase current.
[2023-11-07T12:03:14] Happy Giraffe: Then perfect for statorade dual vesc sleeper or even single
[2023-11-07T12:04:27] cihan: Ninebot is cheap for what it is, buying everything individually costs much more. I was surprised it had active balancing BMS when I got it. I didn't expect it.
[2023-11-07T12:05:27] Mirono escooters: Tis passive, resistors
[2023-11-07T12:05:33] Mirono escooters: Active is dumping into other cells
[2023-11-07T12:06:58] cihan: Is ninebot BMS passive and does only decrease voltage of high voltage cell?
[2023-11-07T12:07:11] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-11-07T12:07:32] cihan: But it keeps balancing while riding too, not only when charging to full.
[2023-11-07T12:07:52] Mirono escooters: No, it should only balance while charging
[2023-11-07T12:09:27] cihan: No, it balances when not charging too. I've seen it many times. When I discharged it to low levels like %10-15 charge highest voltage between cells increased to 25mV. And then it was again 5mV when waiting.
[2023-11-07T12:09:48] Mirono escooters: No, thats just because battery settles ..
[2023-11-07T12:11:34] cihan: I didn't check cell voltages so I cannot say if it was active. That's weird because it almost always keeps voltage difference at 5mV and I never charged the battery to 100%. Only 2 times to 95% and at most 85% on all other times.
[2023-11-07T12:11:55] Mirono escooters: Look, I know the BMS is not active , and only balances while charging
[2023-11-07T12:12:12] Mirono escooters: ü§≠ or its some weird new BMS, but I very doubt it
[2023-11-07T12:12:18] Mirono escooters: Only Xiaomi changed to new BMS afaik
[2023-11-07T12:12:48] cihan: OK, no offense) But it has always 5mV max difference and I don't know how it does it.
[2023-11-07T12:13:02] Mirono escooters: ü§∑
[2023-11-07T12:13:08] Mirono escooters: 5mv is nothing
[2023-11-07T12:13:53] cihan: Yes, really perfect balance all the time. And it balances whenever it exceeds 5mV probably, I think it could be more loose like 100mV.
[2023-11-07T12:14:09] Mirono escooters: 100mv is very bad
[2023-11-07T12:21:56] cihan: Is it too high? I'm used to see Navee n65 battery out of balance at 0.7V on many videos. üòÖ
[2023-11-07T12:22:50] Mirono escooters: What üíÄ
[2023-11-07T12:23:06] Mirono escooters: You mean sag, for really unbalance
[2023-11-07T12:24:43] cihan: I sometimes check this to feel myself good. I love seeing this perfect balance.
[2023-11-07T12:25:35] cihan: Navee BMS doesn't balance at all probably.) it is necessary to balance manually time to time. That's why I never questioned price when JK BMS was recommended .)
[2023-11-07T12:25:50] Mirono escooters: What tge
[2023-11-07T12:26:00] Mirono escooters: It's shit build if it disbalanfzs like dis
[2023-11-07T12:26:16] cihan: tge?
[2023-11-07T12:26:31] cihan: It's BMS is only protective, not a true BMS as said.
[2023-11-07T12:27:11] Mirono escooters: The
[2023-11-07T12:27:14] Mirono escooters: Rofl
[2023-11-07T12:28:31] cihan: I'll use it's no name cells once I get a controller and build it. I'll almost always charge it to 100% probably and I'll get rid of it after a while and will get name brand cells. No I won't throw them away, they'll be clock cells.)

[2023-11-07T23:54:00] francois schempers: spintend üëå
[2023-11-07T23:55:46] eriickk_05: Like what do you mean?
[2023-11-07T23:55:47] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I ment what you said bro
[2023-11-07T23:55:51] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: The helmet
[2023-11-07T23:55:58] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Without tech
[2023-11-07T23:56:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Basically they are does are the same
[2023-11-07T23:56:31] francois schempers: I means don't buy flipsky, to much problems
[2023-11-07T23:56:41] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Third better brand he sent you
[2023-11-07T23:57:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: If you tell what you will build we could help to sort what you need
[2023-11-07T23:57:37] francois schempers: https://spintend.com/collections/esc-based-on-vesc
[2023-11-07T23:59:03] francois schempers: give us the battery and motor specs, and what performance do you aim, we'll help you choose something reliable
[2023-11-07T23:59:51] eriickk_05: I have to build a zwheel zrino duo to 75v with fw, approximately put 30A to each engine
[2023-11-08T00:00:15] francois schempers: so dual motor setup ?
[2023-11-08T00:00:30] eriickk_05: yes
[2023-11-08T00:00:50] francois schempers: then a dual controller could be interesting for you
[2023-11-08T00:01:57] eriickk_05: I guess, never try any vesc, I have a budget of 200‚Ç¨ for controllers
[2023-11-08T00:02:12] sombre_enfant: Buy two 80100 from james
[2023-11-08T00:02:30] francois schempers: for both ?
[2023-11-08T00:03:27] eriickk_05: yes
[2023-11-08T00:05:42] francois schempers: this is a bit over your price, but will get the job done, doing both motor at once https://spintend.com/collections/esc-based-on-vesc/products/dual-ubox-v2-75v-100a-x2-j-for-diy-electric-scooter-diy-ebike-diy-escooter to my knowledge I don't know reliable controller x2 at 75v for less than 200, I'll let other people advise you, but if you're willing to put those 40 bucks more, you won't be disappointed
[2023-11-08T00:12:04] eriickk_05: it's too expensive, I don't have so much budget, I have 200‚Ç¨
[2023-11-08T00:16:13] haku: can you connect that air glasses to phone while on vesc app RT?
[2023-11-08T00:16:59] eriickk_05: recommend this or suffer also from overheating?
[2023-11-08T00:17:32] Mirono escooters: Max 12s haha
[2023-11-08T00:17:38] Mirono escooters: 4.2 is very old. Avoid.
[2023-11-08T00:17:50] Mirono escooters: Flipsky dual is your best bet 2 75100 over can or dual pcb 75100
[2023-11-08T00:17:53] Mirono escooters: Under 200‚Ç¨
[2023-11-08T00:19:24] Jhinzuo ~~: 75100 die on bms cutoff so he needs a good battery or set it up good
[2023-11-08T00:20:32] eriickk_05: Okay, that's what I'll buy with my budget.
[2023-11-08T00:20:42] eriickk_05: What do you mean?
[2023-11-08T00:24:30] Jhinzuo ~~: Yup we just had another user blow up on him without having the bms hitting the limit
[2023-11-08T00:25:17] Jhinzuo ~~: so its really important to be sure ur battery is capable of what u trying to pull
[2023-11-08T00:27:32] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Dies if you dont know what you do ,i would say üòÖ
[2023-11-08T00:27:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Never managed to kill any ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-11-08T00:28:36] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Basically yes
[2023-11-08T00:28:39] eriickk_05: I don't understand exactly? you mean that the battery is able to supply the amp discharge that the controller asks for?
[2023-11-08T00:29:21] Mirono escooters: Set up properly hahaha
[2023-11-08T00:29:41] Mirono escooters: Or add a capacitor and pray Just set up correctly
[2023-11-08T00:31:33] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I am still on that side if you dont hunt for stupid prices you dont win them,vesc can be set to take a look Also if you dont have that and batt low maybe you Should not want to give all amps possible,coz it will shit it self and fails
[2023-11-08T00:45:54] Jhinzuo ~~: yes for example if you have a bms limit of 30A and you exceed this and your battery goes into protect mode , in that moment mosfet and a few other components on the 12v rail die
[2023-11-08T01:39:13] haku: is this common on al flipsky models?
[2023-11-08T02:01:19] haku: what other vescs do that?
[2023-11-08T03:03:17] haku: i got the one on the left during the ant sale. is that authentic? it has different markings
[2023-11-08T03:10:03] haku: no chinese symbols
[2023-11-08T03:15:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: The right one probably the oldest
[2023-11-08T03:21:24] haku: i paid 70 bucks for that one :/
[2023-11-08T03:21:45] haku: and it has a different temp sensor
[2023-11-08T03:22:37] haku: wich one would you recomend i use?
[2023-11-08T03:26:22] Paolo ‚Å≠: I always got connector like lower one
[2023-11-08T03:26:39] Paolo ‚Å≠: Maybe it‚Äôs just another version of
[2023-11-08T03:27:17] haku: i see. i hope its not fake. doesnt have the ant logo
[2023-11-08T03:28:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: Maybe just the last batch
[2023-11-08T03:28:20] Paolo ‚Å≠: But normally they comes with serial id
[2023-11-08T03:49:18] haku: hopefully its not fake because i bought a few
[2023-11-08T04:35:31] haku: i just dont want to F around and find out if i connect it to a battery lol
[2023-11-08T06:17:07] haku: why is the 30t costs more than the 40t? it has inferior mah.
[2023-11-08T07:31:48] Mirono escooters: Not usual
[2023-11-08T13:35:25] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Lol i have a bug
[2023-11-08T13:36:45] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Downloaded c350 pdf from rage site i think took a look and delete ,now third day and it downloads it self again and again üòÖ Rage hackü§£
[2023-11-08T13:42:05] NetworkDir: Makerbase and flipsky
[2023-11-08T14:11:40] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Because 30T is more powerful than 40T3 (5-6 IR vs 9 IR). But 40T3 less powerful than old first 40T. You can look at 40T4 then (new, green heat shrink)
[2023-11-08T14:16:00] Mirono escooters: 40t4? Cool

[2023-11-08T16:28:14] Gabe Enzo: Left because of wiring troubles
[2023-11-08T16:28:35] Mirono escooters: That's not a valid argument hahahaba
[2023-11-08T16:29:13] Martin Kaktits: Haha it ultimately doesnt matter that much anyway, just curious
[2023-11-08T16:39:28] Happy Giraffe: Left side is halal, having it on right side is delulu
[2023-11-08T16:40:00] Martin Kaktits: This is fun. What a polarizing topic
[2023-11-08T16:45:29] Mirono escooters: I think you misread
[2023-11-08T16:45:31] Mirono escooters: Or I did
[2023-11-08T16:46:07] Happy Giraffe: Or I mistyped
[2023-11-08T16:46:10] Martin Kaktits: Yeah he basically says Both are bad
[2023-11-08T16:46:17] Mirono escooters: No brakes gang?
[2023-11-08T16:46:53] Happy Giraffe: Meant halal*üòÇ
[2023-11-08T16:47:44] Mirono escooters: So you left brake front gang
[2023-11-08T16:48:16] Happy Giraffe: I am front brake gang, delulu=deluaional and halal=accepted Haram means not acceptable
[2023-11-08T16:51:05] Mirono escooters: Good
[2023-11-08T16:52:03] Martin Kaktits: Delulu my favorite word of 2023
[2023-11-08T16:52:37] Happy Giraffe: (little do you know I have motor ebrake on left aswell, motor is in rear ebike) Rear hydro brake on right side also So its a solulu to a delulu problem
[2023-11-08T16:53:41] Mirono escooters: O o
[2023-11-08T16:53:55] Mirono escooters: Left and right side front brake people, we have a mutual enemy
[2023-11-08T16:53:58] Mirono escooters: Let's team up
[2023-11-08T16:58:48] Happy Giraffe: Watch your words mr right side front brakeüòÇ
[2023-11-08T16:59:33] Happy Giraffe: Do you also read from bottom-up, right to left?
[2023-11-08T17:02:38] Mirono escooters: Thank you for confirming üòÇ
[2023-11-08T17:02:50] Mirono escooters: Martin and I thought we were going crazyy

[2023-11-08T17:24:22] Martin Kaktits: Is it tho? As long as steering wheel approprite side
[2023-11-08T17:24:33] Mirono escooters: There is nothing objectively better about right brake
[2023-11-08T17:25:34] Happy Giraffe: Gravity is holding Australians upside down but will not make your right front brake appropriate
[2023-11-08T17:26:23] Mirono escooters: Ayo
[2023-11-08T17:27:38] Happy Giraffe: I ascended from scooters, and you also said you want an ebike so shusshh
[2023-11-08T17:28:31] Mirono escooters: Bomber has it on left
[2023-11-08T17:28:35] Mirono escooters: I really need to hit some speeds on it
[2023-11-08T17:28:37] Mirono escooters: üòÇüòÇ
[2023-11-08T17:28:52] Mirono escooters: I think my "dragstrip" road here isn't long enough for anything above 100 tbh
[2023-11-08T17:28:59] Mirono escooters: And it's a dead end so that adds to the fun.
[2023-11-08T17:30:01] Mirono escooters: Ok kids let's end playtime
[2023-11-08T17:30:07] Mirono escooters: Everyone does what he prefers
[2023-11-08T17:32:00] Mirono escooters: Ez enough to swap if you don't like
[2023-11-08T17:32:12] Mirono escooters: I dont lIke surron, expensive for what it is
[2023-11-08T17:38:18] Mirono escooters: Hahaahha
[2023-11-08T17:38:34] Mirono escooters: I don't want light frame And legal, I wish But that's not my argument to buy surron hahaha
[2023-11-08T17:40:47] Mirono escooters: Surron and stairs????

[2023-11-08T17:42:03] Gabe Enzo: Miron I'll see if this fixes the motor
[2023-11-08T17:42:24] Mirono escooters: What are we trying to achieve
[2023-11-08T17:42:29] Mirono escooters: If coils burned it's fucked
[2023-11-08T17:42:53] Mirono escooters: No, but a surron on stairs.. uh..
[2023-11-08T17:42:56] Mirono escooters: Idk

[2023-11-08T18:09:57] Happy Giraffe: I doubt even surron frame cant take that
[2023-11-08T18:10:45] Happy Giraffe: Get bearebike frame and proper suspension etc. And brakes need to be like 125cc. Maguras aint stopping shit at that pointü§î
[2023-11-08T18:11:05] Happy Giraffe: Just buy the stark vargüòÇ

[2023-11-08T18:25:32] Happy Giraffe: But even those surrons will be 80kg+ after modding so no real benefit
[2023-11-08T18:25:42] haku: im spoiled i use spinny regen brakes most times.
[2023-11-08T18:38:23] Happy Giraffe: Just get a 50cc moped, put QS138 and register as 45kmh profit
[2023-11-08T18:38:31] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-11-08T18:38:38] Mirono escooters: Problem is if accident insurance fuck u up
[2023-11-08T18:39:07] Happy Giraffe: Nop, 45kmh profile and QS even says those motors are 3kw thats close to the lawüòÖ
[2023-11-08T18:39:19] Mirono escooters: Br√∂der, it's nOt legal
[2023-11-08T18:39:25] Mirono escooters: The papers document a fuel motor
[2023-11-08T18:39:37] Mirono escooters: With a serious accident, insurance will retract
[2023-11-08T18:39:47] Mirono escooters: Or your Finnish laws are different
[2023-11-08T18:40:02] Happy Giraffe: Swedish laws might accept, even surrons can be legal here
[2023-11-08T18:40:41] Mirono escooters: Surrons are legal here too
[2023-11-08T18:40:45] Mirono escooters: Because on paper, electromotor
[2023-11-08T18:41:06] Mirono escooters: But insurance will retract with any accident, because it's not according to papers..
[2023-11-08T18:41:17] Mirono escooters: That's why I'm mad, I wanted to do same in Belgium..
[2023-11-08T18:49:52] Mirono escooters: Step 1: buy house Step 2: ??? Step 3: profit

[2023-11-08T18:50:21] Martin Kaktits: with that powa, you can just drive up stairs
[2023-11-08T18:51:53] Happy Giraffe: If moped then can maybe leave at road/next to house with 16mm chain?
[2023-11-08T18:52:12] Happy Giraffe: Lets put it this way, whats the max weight then?
[2023-11-08T18:52:52] Martin Kaktits: seriously, just leave outside then? Ehh, but charger, someone will steal that :D

[2023-11-08T18:53:53] Happy Giraffe: Heating of battery similar to cars
[2023-11-08T18:53:57] Martin Kaktits: car warming pole??
[2023-11-08T18:54:38] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, we have electric boxes that cars plug into so you can run motor heater for couple of hours before starting on winter

[2023-11-08T22:13:37] NetworkDir: or all brands clone of zero
[2023-11-08T22:13:39] Unknown: Which mukuta ? There is 4-5
[2023-11-08T22:13:55] NetworkDir: Mukuta looks zero & vsett
[2023-11-08T22:13:59] haku: this is the VDM 10 frame right?
[2023-11-08T22:14:14] NetworkDir: but design same generally

[2023-11-08T22:22:21] Unknown: What do u think is better then the zero type scooters ? And don't say nami or weped or the new roadrunner (voro new hyperscoot) and not most of the dualtrons I hate rubber suspension
[2023-11-08T22:22:31] JPPL: AliExpress
[2023-11-08T22:22:53] Unknown: And its different enough to want to get it as an upgrade
[2023-11-08T22:22:55] NetworkDir: nami frame bullshit
[2023-11-08T22:22:59] NetworkDir: wped looks shit
[2023-11-08T22:23:20] NetworkDir: dualtron trash
[2023-11-08T22:23:31] JPPL: Teverun and costum parts
[2023-11-08T22:23:35] Unknown: Stem problems?
[2023-11-08T22:23:40] NetworkDir: zero type scooters not bad but trail bad 100% you need steering damper
[2023-11-08T22:23:50] NetworkDir: no generally looks bad
[2023-11-08T22:23:55] NetworkDir: i don't like nami dualtron types
[2023-11-08T22:24:04] NetworkDir: But teverun superme i love it
[2023-11-08T22:24:31] Unknown: Weped it's motorcycle and looks are sobjcktive (sorry for the English not my first language)
[2023-11-08T22:24:47] Unknown: Too big

[2023-11-08T22:26:37] NetworkDir: lol it's little bit like slack core
[2023-11-08T22:26:38] NetworkDir: little bit
[2023-11-08T22:26:48] puneDir: <photos/photo_10822@08-11-2023_22-26-48.jpg>

[2023-11-08T22:27:14] haku: i agree the teverun is very nice looking frame.
[2023-11-08T22:28:25] Unknown: Haa the one that u can't get in my country like most good scooters (and even if u can it's going to cost triple and be nerfed)
[2023-11-08T22:29:13] Unknown: I agreed first (but I think it's too big for me at least)
[2023-11-08T22:32:45] Unknown: The tevarun fighter 11 costs here 13.650 ils and comes with a 48/26 battery thievery
[2023-11-08T22:34:28] haku: its difficult to eat that cost when you gut the whole scooter and put your prefered components
[2023-11-08T22:34:58] haku: pretty much just keeping the frame.
[2023-11-08T22:36:26] Unknown: This is why when someone from Israel asks me what scooter to get my answer is get whatever you get get second hand and preferably without a battery
[2023-11-08T22:36:30] haku: where did you get that decal?
[2023-11-08T22:36:58] puneDir: Vinyl shop
[2023-11-08T22:37:09] haku: nice!
[2023-11-08T22:37:12] Unknown: Oh did I mention that dual motor are iligal here also ? (You need to buy another one separately)
[2023-11-08T22:37:36] haku: what!? thats crazy man
[2023-11-08T22:37:58] Unknown: Yes my zero10x is single motor haha
[2023-11-08T22:38:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: Disaster
[2023-11-08T22:39:32] haku: is that the flipsky your working on?
[2023-11-08T22:40:51] NetworkDir: i think 75200 flipsky
[2023-11-08T22:41:26] haku: it fits perfectly on there
[2023-11-08T22:42:05] Unknown: Dual
[2023-11-08T22:43:45] Happy Giraffe: But you are asking utopia with 20kw and under 80kg
[2023-11-08T22:44:04] Happy Giraffe: Even stock surrons are 56kg with small motor and battery
[2023-11-08T22:44:31] Happy Giraffe: Frame doesnt quite hold a lot and need maybe to upgrade shocks and fork
[2023-11-08T22:44:56] haku: do you have a photo of this new talaria?
[2023-11-08T22:47:14] haku: nvm i found it. that thing looks huge
[2023-11-08T22:52:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: 75100 alu
[2023-11-08T22:52:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: 75200 is much bigger and has 6 caps
[2023-11-08T22:54:31] Mirono escooters: What happened
[2023-11-08T22:54:34] puneDir: is it good
[2023-11-08T22:54:50] Mirono escooters: Oh god
[2023-11-08T22:55:25] Paolo ‚Å≠: Nothing , but very small space
[2023-11-08T22:58:29] cihan: No problem, they will never ever ask you how you can go that fast with 50cc. They even don't check it on regular inspections. Their only aim is taking money on inspections, they don't inspect much.
[2023-11-08T23:00:27] cihan: Is this a custom 3D printed battery cell holder? @Mirono_escooters
[2023-11-08T23:00:35] Mirono escooters: Yessir
[2023-11-08T23:00:49] Mirono escooters: We have 18s one now, mm precision but fits hahaha
[2023-11-08T23:01:01] cihan: Did you leave little space between cells for cooling?
[2023-11-08T23:01:11] puneDir: thats not for cooling
[2023-11-08T23:01:26] puneDir: its for isolation in case something bad happens
[2023-11-08T23:01:50] Mirono escooters: 0.4mm
[2023-11-08T23:02:08] Mirono escooters: But that's not the point haha, it's isolation and mounting (within rails w screws)
[2023-11-08T23:02:23] Mirono escooters: My 18s is potted with thermally conductive epoxy. It should help.
[2023-11-08T23:02:53] puneDir: epoxy is nice for... Explosion
[2023-11-08T23:03:17] puneDir: if one cell burn Others wont be that much affected
[2023-11-08T23:03:51] puneDir: i want a easy openable g30
[2023-11-08T23:04:03] puneDir: so if my battery burns i can quickly take it out lol
[2023-11-08T23:04:18] puneDir: i dont trust to shit mh1s that has 34 ir
[2023-11-08T23:04:33] puneDir: i prefer turkish aspilsans to 34 ir bomb
[2023-11-08T23:04:34] Mirono escooters: What
[2023-11-08T23:04:42] cihan: I've already talked to @punedir about it but I also wonder your opinion. What if I just glue cells together with hot melt glue firmly and not use any cell holder, bracket, etc? Is there a risk for them to move? I want to use space as efficient as I can.
[2023-11-08T23:04:47] Mirono escooters: Man discovered snsc
[2023-11-08T23:04:49] puneDir: it will help if one cell burn
[2023-11-08T23:04:59] Mirono escooters: Bro, build it properly wtf
[2023-11-08T23:05:03] puneDir: lets make a - shaped thing on rear
[2023-11-08T23:05:10] Mirono escooters: 20 m4 screws Shouldn't stop anyone
[2023-11-08T23:05:16] puneDir: 90 degree turn and its out
[2023-11-08T23:05:30] Mirono escooters: This is another option But! You need to use extra isolation!
[2023-11-08T23:05:35] puneDir: its already builded properly but mh1s have high internal resistance
[2023-11-08T23:05:42] Mirono escooters: So kapton between series groups. And very firm tape, they can not move.
[2023-11-08T23:05:54] Mirono escooters: Prefer 2 layers kapton or 1 layer thick fish paper.
[2023-11-08T23:05:55] puneDir: my holderless baks had kapton+ fishpaper on every cell
[2023-11-08T23:05:58] puneDir: The one cengiz builded
[2023-11-08T23:06:03] Mirono escooters: Imo you don't save that much space. I prefer fine printed holders.
[2023-11-08T23:06:09] NetworkDir: with daly non active balancer you want get 40A ? üòê
[2023-11-08T23:06:27] puneDir: Yes i do and i take Problem?
[2023-11-08T23:06:37] NetworkDir: 33 ir to much
[2023-11-08T23:06:38] puneDir: Just charge every night until morning
[2023-11-08T23:06:44] NetworkDir: datasheet stock ir ?
[2023-11-08T23:06:45] puneDir: Brand new mh1 is 30
[2023-11-08T23:06:52] puneDir: 30-34
[2023-11-08T23:07:10] Mirono escooters: Actually reasonable
[2023-11-08T23:07:20] puneDir: Measured internal resistance of the tested samplesL 34.2 and 36.2 mOhms
[2023-11-08T23:07:26] puneDir: Holy shit
[2023-11-08T23:07:45] puneDir: i guess non used mh1 can be compared with 50 cent baks
[2023-11-08T23:08:06] NetworkDir: Yes for mh1 ok
[2023-11-08T23:08:12] NetworkDir: Your pack 20s4p ?
[2023-11-08T23:08:17] puneDir: Yes
[2023-11-08T23:08:20] NetworkDir: Oh
[2023-11-08T23:08:21] Jhinzuo ~~: Damn time to replace my 300cycle mh1 battery
[2023-11-08T23:08:27] NetworkDir: 10A is max current
[2023-11-08T23:08:38] puneDir: fuck it i cant live with that battery Going to sell it
[2023-11-08T23:08:38] NetworkDir: not continuous
[2023-11-08T23:08:50] puneDir: And make new pack with brand new aspilsan
[2023-11-08T23:09:09] NetworkDir: aspilsan not very good also
[2023-11-08T23:09:20] puneDir: It is for price
[2023-11-08T23:09:25] NetworkDir: maybe
[2023-11-08T23:09:40] puneDir: 25a discharge
[2023-11-08T23:09:43] puneDir: 2900 mah
[2023-11-08T23:09:47] cihan: Measured values seem not bad and it's much cheaper.
[2023-11-08T23:09:49] puneDir: 12 ir i guess
[2023-11-08T23:10:03] NetworkDir: But measured data's from factory need test
[2023-11-08T23:10:12] cihan: <photos/photo_10826@08-11-2023_23-10-12.jpg>
[2023-11-08T23:10:17] puneDir: aselsans brand Cant be bad
[2023-11-08T23:10:36] puneDir: maybe one of the best cells in the market
[2023-11-08T23:10:43] NetworkDir: "in turkiye market"
[2023-11-08T23:10:44] puneDir: its military grade
[2023-11-08T23:10:47] puneDir: No
[2023-11-08T23:10:51] NetworkDir: huh
[2023-11-08T23:10:52] puneDir: Dont you know aselsan?
[2023-11-08T23:10:52] NetworkDir: lol
[2023-11-08T23:10:58] Jhinzuo ~~: military grade is a scam
[2023-11-08T23:11:10] puneDir: That cells are in military grade tech
[2023-11-08T23:11:24] puneDir: Aselsan is biggest company that makes military stuff in turkey
[2023-11-08T23:11:50] Mirono escooters: Uhm, military grade is nothing
[2023-11-08T23:11:50] NetworkDir: What's mean? Standard discharge 590mA? Max continuos discharge 25000mA ? lol?
[2023-11-08T23:11:56] NetworkDir: standard 0.5A ?
[2023-11-08T23:12:00] cihan: It's not military grade but the company is not privately owned so they probably don't seek making lots of profit.
[2023-11-08T23:12:02] NetworkDir: <sticker>
[2023-11-08T23:12:03] Mirono escooters: Yes, that's the test amps
[2023-11-08T23:12:11] puneDir: They use this cells on their armored vehicles
[2023-11-08T23:12:16] puneDir: And their air stuff
[2023-11-08T23:12:19] Mirono escooters: It's not that hard xD, yes most use the cells at 0.5-1a
[2023-11-08T23:12:48] NetworkDir: But i don't think continuos discharge is really 25a
[2023-11-08T23:13:27] puneDir: aselsan makes that stuff
[2023-11-08T23:13:31] puneDir: <photos/photo_10828@08-11-2023_23-13-31.jpg>
[2023-11-08T23:13:34] Jhinzuo ~~: yea me neither but mh1 isnt really 10a aswell more like 7a
[2023-11-08T23:13:38] puneDir: It is
[2023-11-08T23:13:40] Mirono escooters: Let's not believe datasheets then -_-
[2023-11-08T23:14:03] puneDir: Theyre not same brand but associated
[2023-11-08T23:14:27] puneDir: Believe this cells cant be bad
[2023-11-08T23:14:36] cihan: Those values are probably meant for providing some standards like minimum cycle life, max shelf life etc. Graphs under show cycle life in different discharge conditions.
[2023-11-08T23:14:41] haku: what cells byraktar uses?
[2023-11-08T23:14:46] puneDir: aspilsan
[2023-11-08T23:14:55] puneDir: aselsans brand
[2023-11-08T23:15:07] puneDir: <photos/photo_10829@08-11-2023_23-15-07.jpg>
[2023-11-08T23:15:13] haku: where is that made if you dont mind me asking?
[2023-11-08T23:15:20] puneDir: cell?
[2023-11-08T23:15:27] haku: yes
[2023-11-08T23:15:28] cihan: Vtc6 is probably still king of 18650 for high current discharge.
[2023-11-08T23:15:40] puneDir: Kayseri/Turkey
[2023-11-08T23:18:18] cihan: Aspilsan is good for supplying some minimum standard and being cheap. I would still prefer Molicel if I could get p42a for 4 euros each but lithium cells are expensive in Turkey so it makes Aspilsan a good alternative. For same price I would prefer vtc6 any day.
[2023-11-08T23:18:48] puneDir: Aspilsan is 77 lira Mh1 is 150
[2023-11-08T23:18:56] puneDir: Aspilsan is 30x better than mh1
[2023-11-08T23:19:25] puneDir: 25 amp discharge for that price :)
[2023-11-08T23:19:34] cihan: I'd prefer Aspilsan over mh1 but for same price Sony / Murata vtc6 all the way.
[2023-11-08T23:19:47] puneDir: Hard to find original
[2023-11-09T00:02:58] Happy Giraffe: When you are in military and see the "grade" it's exactly nothing
[2023-11-09T00:05:04] Happy Giraffe: 77 lira 2.52‚Ç¨ for that not too bad
[2023-11-09T00:05:20] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-11-09T00:28:18] cihan: It's good but p42a for 3-4 euros is much better if such a deal is caught.
[2023-11-09T00:32:25] cihan: Headlines mean nothing without details. I think this is valid for every concept existing on earth but I realised this first time when checking news on economic calendar years ago then realised it's same for all other headlines too. Military grade is an envelope / cover for today's marketing gimmicks.
[2023-11-09T00:33:47] Happy Giraffe: Yeah was just talking about your situation
[2023-11-09T02:07:11] haku: i will not be surprised if US military use vesc drones. would be funny though
[2023-11-09T05:34:42] Happy Giraffe: Would be fun to know what esc they use
[2023-11-09T06:34:57] Happy Giraffe: This is offtopic but I only do one msg about it. Today going into technology event that has robots etc stuff so I hunt down an engineer and ask about all the stuff and preach how our god-lord Vedder is the best guy ever Mostly interested on how they control the motors with precision when arm is shaped like crazy
[2023-11-09T06:37:22] haku: there is a robot fighting league here in las vegas. pretty crazy stuff. you cam even place bets lol
[2023-11-09T06:45:40] haku: oh you mean like boston dynamics robots?
[2023-11-09T08:06:55] Mirono escooters: No, they use simple proprietary stuff
[2023-11-09T08:07:03] Mirono escooters: Opensource is not what a military wants hahaha
[2023-11-09T08:20:26] francois schempers: and it lacks redundancy, military want that if it fail their's a failsafe system
[2023-11-09T08:21:59] Mirono escooters: Yep
[2023-11-09T08:22:21] Mirono escooters: The foc of vescs isn't that special, many can replicate it Its just a good integrated opensource platform that makes it great
[2023-11-09T08:22:29] Mirono escooters: And user friendly ish
[2023-11-09T10:39:02] Ion: quick question, is anyone familiar with these motors from laotie scooters? https://www.banggood.com/LAOTIE-52V-1200W-Motor-10inch-Wheel-Electric-Scooter-Hub-Motor-Front-or-Rear-Drive-Brushless-Motor-For-LAOTIE-ES18-Lite-p-1975107.html?cur_warehouse=CN&ID=6290405&rmmds=search do they suck?

[2023-11-09T10:40:17] Ion: I couldn't find kv and magnet size
[2023-11-09T10:44:47] Mirono escooters: Am I this wrong? Why would the military want a opensource, small developed thing?
[2023-11-09T10:44:55] Mirono escooters: That's like the opposite of safe hahaha
[2023-11-09T10:45:14] puneDir: Imagine falling a usa drone with just connecting to vesc tool and set one motor current to 0
[2023-11-09T10:45:30] koxx / Francois Deslandes: huge economy on licences
[2023-11-09T10:45:42] Mirono escooters: Military got enough money hahaha
[2023-11-09T10:54:00] puneDir: i just accidentally swallowed 18650 battery electrolide
[2023-11-09T10:54:34] Jan: Lol
[2023-11-09T10:55:06] haku: i do not have that exact motor. but laotie makes the 60v one. imo you can get it cheaper in ali. but if you bangood has a sale go for it. it is a generic scooter motor
[2023-11-09T10:56:16] Ion: I only found their 11" motors to be 60v, but I'll still do some more research. also, I noticed no hall sensors
[2023-11-09T10:58:04] haku: yea. find one with some. alot here like the vsett motors. im not sure though
[2023-11-09T10:58:36] Ion: yes, the Vsett ones are 50H and nice from what I've seen, more expensive tho
[2023-11-09T11:01:28] haku: anyone can get access too. maybe if they lock it like what torp does. lol
[2023-11-09T11:02:23] Mirono escooters: ü§∑ it seems a bit hassle for nothing
[2023-11-09T11:55:05] haku: anyone tried fitting a 12 inch tire into thier 11 inch scooters? i wonder if there is clearance.
[2023-11-09T12:17:28] JPPL: Diameter off motor is same, depends on the scooter
[2023-11-09T14:00:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I only have experience with the 11" type Does have magnets from two parts
[2023-11-09T14:07:46] üé∏ POSS üèÅ (Crimekillz): lithium is good for manic depression
[2023-11-09T14:07:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2023-11-09T14:08:17] Paolo ‚Å≠: They dont suck
[2023-11-09T14:08:23] puneDir: really?
[2023-11-09T14:08:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: But brake cabld goes outside throught brake disk, that really suck
[2023-11-09T14:08:45] puneDir: i should eat more cells
[2023-11-09T14:09:16] üé∏ POSS üèÅ (Crimekillz): used to be first line treatment, yes
[2023-11-09T14:10:03] Ion: do you know the specs on these (kv, magnet size) perhaps? Also it's listed as "52v", but more would be fine, right?
[2023-11-09T14:10:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: I dont suggest this version
[2023-11-09T14:10:47] Paolo ‚Å≠: Low kv
[2023-11-09T14:13:07] Ion: I was thinking about the Vsett 10 motors too, but they are more expensive from what I've seen. (this would be for G30, 16s probably)
[2023-11-09T14:14:16] Paolo ‚Å≠: Where are you from
[2023-11-09T14:14:27] Paolo ‚Å≠: The high kv version of this motor is very good
[2023-11-09T14:14:42] Ion: Austria, EU
[2023-11-09T14:25:51] Gabe Enzo: Yeah LOL
[2023-11-09T14:26:21] Gabe Enzo: Is there any way to just use a Xiaomi accelerator and brake via main wiring? and not use the dashboard? @Mirono_escooters @punedir
[2023-11-09T14:32:52] puneDir: yes
[2023-11-09T14:32:56] puneDir: connect to adc
[2023-11-09T14:48:41] Happy Giraffe: Don't directly put 5v stuff on vesc, do resistor mod or adc board
[2023-11-09T14:51:33] puneDir: just connect to 3.3v?
[2023-11-09T14:53:44] Gabe Enzo: its 3.3v.
[2023-11-09T14:54:30] Happy Giraffe: Atleast old xiaomi stuff is 5v

[2023-11-09T15:44:25] cihan: Is makerbase 75200 safe for 20s battery, I'll be using regenerative braking so it will create extra 6V at most with 20S, but I have the option to never charge battery over 90%.
[2023-11-09T15:45:43] puneDir: Why 75200
[2023-11-09T15:45:47] Federico77: <photos/photo_10831@09-11-2023_15-45-47.jpg>
[2023-11-09T15:45:47] Federico77: <photos/photo_10832@09-11-2023_15-45-47.jpg>
[2023-11-09T15:45:56] puneDir: and yes it is
[2023-11-09T15:45:58] cihan: More mosfets
[2023-11-09T15:46:01] puneDir: Even 75100
[2023-11-09T15:46:05] puneDir: no need for your current
[2023-11-09T15:46:20] puneDir: Get 75100 alupcb instead
[2023-11-09T15:46:31] cihan: It will have better cooling with more mosfets probably.
[2023-11-09T15:47:07] cihan: And it will be more future proof.
[2023-11-09T15:47:11] Paolo ‚Å≠: Cpu ?
[2023-11-09T15:47:20] puneDir: Get 75100 alupcb instead
[2023-11-09T15:48:21] cihan: Price difference is small. 75200 seems better choice if it doesn't have drawbacks.
[2023-11-09T15:48:37] puneDir: 75100 alu is 2700 liras
[2023-11-09T15:48:46] puneDir: too unreliable
[2023-11-09T15:49:02] Federico77: <photos/photo_10833@09-11-2023_15-49-02.jpg>
[2023-11-09T15:49:11] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: 75100 Alu got the same issues, doesn't matter. If he can fit 75200, go for it?
[2023-11-09T15:49:27] puneDir: 75100 alu is so cheap compared to 75200
[2023-11-09T15:50:05] Federico77: <photos/photo_10834@09-11-2023_15-50-05.jpg>
[2023-11-09T15:50:06] Federico77: <photos/photo_10835@09-11-2023_15-50-06.jpg>
[2023-11-09T15:51:01] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: You still did not manage to connect the dashboard? üòÇ
[2023-11-09T15:51:27] Federico77: <photos/photo_10836@09-11-2023_15-51-27.jpg>
[2023-11-09T15:51:31] Gabe Enzo: Yes. I'm just going to use no dashboard.
[2023-11-09T15:51:40] Gabe Enzo: I'm connecting it all manually now.
[2023-11-09T15:51:50] Federico77: ü§î
[2023-11-09T15:52:44] Federico77: <photos/photo_10837@09-11-2023_15-52-44.jpg>
[2023-11-09T15:53:06] Izuna ÁîüÊ¥ª: Good luck üíÄ No offense but not being able to connect 4 wires and copy paste a script and hit upload doesn't sound like you manage to do it manually either.
[2023-11-09T15:53:48] Federico77: @PaoloWu
[2023-11-09T15:57:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: Seems to be grnuine
[2023-11-09T16:01:55] Federico77: Let's hope it's genuine
[2023-11-09T17:29:38] Ion: Oh no, PMT makes solid tires now üòÖ
[2023-11-09T17:30:04] Ion: would this still fit most 10" scooters? (like the 10+)
[2023-11-09T17:33:46] Jan: 10x3 full slick would be nice
[2023-11-09T17:45:05] NetworkDir: Ban the pmt
[2023-11-09T17:45:07] NetworkDir: xD
[2023-11-09T17:45:38] NetworkDir: Why not 6.5 rim üò≠
[2023-11-09T17:55:29] NetworkDir: 10x3.5 ?
[2023-11-09T17:56:03] NetworkDir: Oh actually my scooter rim is 6
[2023-11-09T17:56:17] NetworkDir: Ninebot users happy with 6.5
[2023-11-09T17:57:59] sombre_enfant: Theyre 11"
[2023-11-09T17:58:08] NetworkDir: Hmm
[2023-11-09T17:59:37] NetworkDir: Zero is 80/65-6 And this 80/70-6
[2023-11-09T17:59:53] NetworkDir: Should to fit on vsett and zeros
[2023-11-09T18:12:32] Gabe Enzo: I wired ADC manually. My brake ADC showed voltage but acceleration didn't, so I wired it up In the reverse and now acceleration shows ADC but brakes don't. how is this possible?
[2023-11-09T18:15:47] Gabe Enzo: The ADC is set, but no current flows to the motor.
[2023-11-09T18:16:04] Gabe Enzo: Brake issue still there
[2023-11-09T18:16:23] Gabe Enzo: I'm just confused why it isn't throttling lmao this was the last step basically
[2023-11-09T18:17:30] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2023-11-09T18:31:48] JPPL: Control type
[2023-11-09T18:31:59] JPPL: Change to currwnt no reverse brake adc2
[2023-11-09T18:32:02] JPPL: Something like This
[2023-11-09T18:40:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: Wirh 10x3 is already like egg
[2023-11-09T18:41:06] Paolo ‚Å≠: 10x3,5 is too much
[2023-11-09T18:59:48] Mirono escooters: Nothing is moving
[2023-11-09T18:59:56] Mirono escooters: There is no throttle input
[2023-11-09T19:00:13] Mirono escooters: You have it set to izunas settings? Re set em, BCS his are only for dash use
[2023-11-09T19:01:10] Gabe Enzo: We reset it. Didn't make a difference.
[2023-11-09T19:01:30] Mirono escooters: Kaput then
[2023-11-09T19:01:36] Jhinzuo ~~: i think so too
[2023-11-09T19:01:57] Jhinzuo ~~: i redid everything , flashed fresh 6.05 set up foc first then setup lisp setup adc app and throttle
[2023-11-09T19:02:03] Mirono escooters: <animation>
[2023-11-09T19:02:04] Mirono escooters: Me holding back to say skill issue
[2023-11-09T19:02:10] Jhinzuo ~~: then under mapping whe have channel 2 missing input
[2023-11-09T19:02:23] Mirono escooters: Heh
[2023-11-09T19:02:27] Jhinzuo ~~: so i guess we have wiring issue on dashboard
[2023-11-09T19:02:33] Mirono escooters: Go to 6.02 , more stable Electron no beta
[2023-11-09T19:02:40] Gabe Enzo: I have more hours on vesc tool than you and zuna combined.
[2023-11-09T19:02:51] Jhinzuo ~~: probably no üòÄ
[2023-11-09T19:02:52] Mirono escooters: Hours mean nothing
[2023-11-09T19:02:55] Mirono escooters: Dont be mad bro
[2023-11-09T19:03:00] Gabe Enzo: I was popping a joke
[2023-11-09T19:03:02] Gabe Enzo: chill haha
[2023-11-09T19:03:03] Mirono escooters: I'm the only here apperantly bothering to answer
[2023-11-09T19:03:04] Mirono escooters: Oki

[2023-11-09T19:03:18] Gabe Enzo: Tomorrow we will see
[2023-11-09T19:03:24] Mirono escooters: Yet
[2023-11-09T19:03:26] Mirono escooters: *ban*
[2023-11-09T19:03:41] Jhinzuo ~~: unbuild mp2 waiting on mosfets :C 6more days
[2023-11-09T19:04:01] Mirono escooters: Aaaa
[2023-11-09T19:04:12] Mirono escooters: I can't find time to work on mineü§∑
[2023-11-09T19:04:45] Jhinzuo ~~: yea u have a job im unable to work so i got lots of free time üòÄ
[2023-11-09T19:04:54] Mirono escooters: I wish School payed me
[2023-11-09T19:05:34] Jhinzuo ~~: what are u learing if i may ask
[2023-11-09T19:05:44] Mirono escooters: Engineering
[2023-11-09T19:06:42] Jhinzuo ~~: ah makes sense you know all this stuff
[2023-11-09T19:07:25] Mirono escooters: I'm getting there eventually
[2023-11-09T19:07:33] Mirono escooters: More into mechanical engineering atm
[2023-11-09T19:13:06] Gabe Enzo: Lmao, @nosoudoppi
[2023-11-09T19:13:15] Gabe Enzo: I get my free gov money from uni
[2023-11-09T19:13:35] Gabe Enzo: What year are you in? im Year 1
[2023-11-09T19:13:57] Mirono escooters: I have to pay lol
[2023-11-09T19:14:01] Mirono escooters: Last
[2023-11-09T19:14:08] Mirono escooters: But I'll do more after dis
[2023-11-09T19:14:20] Gabe Enzo: of course!
[2023-11-09T19:14:23] Jhinzuo ~~: i wish i had the motivation to go back to school
[2023-11-09T19:14:37] Mirono escooters: I don't have hahahaha
[2023-11-09T19:14:39] Mirono escooters: Still go
[2023-11-09T19:14:53] Gabe Enzo: don't need much motivation if it's your field tbh
[2023-11-09T19:14:57] Jhinzuo ~~: hahaha winner mindset
[2023-11-09T19:17:31] Mirono escooters: It still sucks
[2023-11-09T19:17:40] Mirono escooters: The learning part :)
[2023-11-09T19:19:04] Jhinzuo ~~: Yes the learning is the most exhausting part , but after getting it and being able to use these information is nice
[2023-11-09T19:20:20] Mirono escooters: Yes, I wish I could just download in my head hahaha
[2023-11-09T19:20:46] Jhinzuo ~~: Broooo that would be so good
[2023-11-09T19:20:53] Jhinzuo ~~: plug usb in head over night
[2023-11-09T19:21:05] Jhinzuo ~~: and then you have like 200page manual all inside head
[2023-11-09T19:22:15] Mirono escooters: Or share info over phone without typing a lot
[2023-11-09T19:22:23] Mirono escooters: So electron and such would get valuable info without hours spend
[2023-11-09T20:21:23] haku: thank you for doing this!
[2023-11-09T20:27:16] haku: does pmt really make a difference compared to aliexpress rubber? more traction?
[2023-11-09T20:32:02] Mirono escooters: Rubber vs nylon
[2023-11-09T20:32:58] haku: i will get pmts and compare. I hope your right.
[2023-11-09T20:33:17] Mirono escooters: I always am ;)
[2023-11-09T20:33:22] Mirono escooters: (it's really noticable)
[2023-11-09T20:35:01] haku: reason i asked is i have pmt tire style from ali. when i get new motors i dont know if i should just switch tires or get pmt.
[2023-11-09T20:35:26] Martin Kaktits: oh man, I didnt believe too, but then I got some PMT and, man, its nice. Properly round for once and smooth. Sometimes almost feels like I have a flat/ soft tire even tho its fine
[2023-11-09T20:36:59] haku: the hype is real then.
[2023-11-09T20:37:16] Martin Kaktits: get on the hype train chooo choo
[2023-11-09T20:44:50] Jan: Once you have driven pmt you dont wanna get back
[2023-11-09T20:47:02] JPPL: Pmt best ever personally
[2023-11-09T21:00:51] haku: i will board the train then
[2023-11-09T21:01:53] Mirono escooters: On that note I don't find the price justified for my scooter. So I buy cst like izunas
[2023-11-09T21:40:45] haku: im so tempted to get this for my son but i might end up keeping it for my own.
[2023-11-09T21:42:05] haku: christmas is around the corner too
[2023-11-09T21:42:36] Mirono escooters: Looks badass.
[2023-11-09T23:14:47] Happy Giraffe: How about 7" android tablets as screenüòÇ Can watch netflix on traffic lights
[2023-11-09T23:15:20] Happy Giraffe: And how usually Android devices are compatible with these kind of projectsü§î
[2023-11-09T23:19:03] haku: its just the hassle of removing it and charging it. opening vesc tool and stuff. but that is a really good choice. gps and vesctool side by side
[2023-11-09T23:20:19] haku: thats what my display is right now actually
[2023-11-09T23:22:25] haku: it drains the battery like crazy too
[2023-11-09T23:27:53] Happy Giraffe: Yeah there are the limitations, a button controlled android phone could be fun to be permanently mounted there also but proper use of it would require so much work
[2023-11-09T23:32:01] Happy Giraffe: Or to just make a 3D printed mount for a secondary phone thats inside a waterproof case. Then use that "burner" phone there so your own one wont be fkd up by the cold etc Actually fuk it lets go Imma go make thisüòÇ
[2023-11-09T23:32:29] Mirono escooters: Vesc tab is underrated. So good.
[2023-11-09T23:32:53] Happy Giraffe: Tab?üòÅ
[2023-11-09T23:33:24] puneDir: Make custom screen And mount it
[2023-11-09T23:33:26] haku: agreed. every time i stop at a stop light i look at rt data
[2023-11-09T23:33:40] puneDir: And phone on triban holder
[2023-11-09T23:34:00] Happy Giraffe: Ahh he meant that, no need for custom screen if you can just put whole old phone there
[2023-11-09T23:35:19] Happy Giraffe: Maybe a 3D printed case and then some protective transparent film from old bicycle phone bag
[2023-11-09T23:35:28] puneDir: Im going to make 12 fet 75100
[2023-11-09T23:35:51] puneDir: So it wont burn
[2023-11-09T23:35:55] Happy Giraffe: Is your vesc running now?
[2023-11-09T23:35:56] haku: if you want to get fancy get one of those air glasses @francois_schempers was talking about and connect it to phone for vesc tool
[2023-11-09T23:36:16] puneDir: No the burned one is in the trash
[2023-11-09T23:36:26] puneDir: I ordered 75100 alupcb
[2023-11-09T23:36:53] Happy Giraffe: Then propably good to be humble and get them working before building ownüòÇ
[2023-11-09T23:37:15] puneDir: No
[2023-11-09T23:37:18] Mirono escooters: He doesn't listen
[2023-11-09T23:37:28] puneDir: It costs more money to repair
[2023-11-09T23:37:42] Jhinzuo ~~: just swapping fets isnt that expensive
[2023-11-09T23:37:44] puneDir: + it will burn again with my currents
[2023-11-09T23:37:58] puneDir: yes did that but theres also shorting 5 and 3.3v rail
[2023-11-09T23:37:58] Happy Giraffe: I meant to buy new and use it, then when vehicle works build newüòÖ
[2023-11-09T23:38:21] puneDir: g30 is running now üòÅ (i hope)

[2023-11-10T10:23:15] Mirono escooters: There's a limit on how fast mos drivers can switch.

[2023-11-10T17:46:33] cihan: I'll buy a controller in this 11.11 at last. Ubox 80V 100A is recommended but I'll have to deal with customs problems if I order from ubox site. I'll buy from aliexpress probably. Makerbase 75200 v2 is blinking an eye now. Should I find another alternative or buy it? And is there a list for cables, connectors, Bluetooth module, ADC, etc so that I can also order them with controller? I'll connect it to navee n65. Maybe a new throttle and screen too? I don't need a dashboard by the way, I'll check battery status from BMS app mostly but a live screen showing only voltage isn't bad. Also will I need a button to turn on and off? I think about making a simple current limiting switch or should I get an antispark switch?
[2023-11-10T17:46:53] Mirono escooters: 11.11 good deals
[2023-11-10T17:46:59] puneDir: i run out of nickel lol

[2023-11-10T22:10:59] puneDir: Also 75200 is big Will be hard to mount in navee
[2023-11-10T22:11:49] cihan: If I set undervoltage on VESC higher than undervoltage of BMS is it fine? VESC will decrease current before BMS shuts down current.
[2023-11-10T22:12:17] cihan: I'll check size, you're right, I still didn't open and check the area to fit it.
[2023-11-10T22:19:55] cihan: Makerbase 75200 v2 130x68x28mm Makerbase 75100V2 103x58x19mm Makerbase 60100hp 93x66x24mm I think there's not a significant size difference and there should be enough room for any of them.
[2023-11-10T22:22:40] cihan: Unfortunately, I can also tell a friend to buy one but it will take long time before he arrives Turkey.
[2023-11-10T22:23:22] cihan: Well I guess they included the height of the fins too in that size but in worst case scenario I'll melt down those fins to fit.
[2023-11-10T22:25:23] cihan: Yes, if a friend brings it I won't pay customs fee. In the past customs officers were getting the bribe time to time or making things harder to get the item from customs. Now the government takes the same money officially as customes fee.))
[2023-11-10T22:28:39] cihan: I didn't measure yet but 5 cells aligned as honeycomb and seperated like 3mm away from each other fits, I saw battery on videos. So width is bigger than 90mm. And 18650 cell fits the height so height is bigger than 65mm. All three controllers should fit.
[2023-11-10T22:29:22] puneDir: Whats the max phase 75100 alu can push
[2023-11-10T22:29:49] puneDir: 220?
[2023-11-10T22:30:27] cihan: BMS cut won't be a problem if VESC can decrease current before BMS cuts. Can makerbase 75200 measure voltage correctly? I asked since it cannot measure current correctly but I guess it doesn't use shunt resistor to measure voltage, does it?
[2023-11-10T22:30:48] puneDir: It does
[2023-11-10T22:31:22] cihan: I'll try but I don't have worries if makerbase gives correct size.
[2023-11-10T22:31:55] puneDir: ubox is much better
[2023-11-10T22:32:26] cihan: So wrong current measurement leads to wrong voltage measurement and cutoff voltage or voltage at which current starts to decrease will be different than the set voltage on VESC?
[2023-11-10T22:32:45] puneDir: No
[2023-11-10T22:32:54] puneDir: It should read current correctly
[2023-11-10T22:32:56] puneDir: Voltage too
[2023-11-10T22:34:25] puneDir: 75100 box burns with everything
[2023-11-10T22:34:33] puneDir: Even if bms doesnt cuts
[2023-11-10T22:34:46] puneDir: it explodes itself
[2023-11-10T22:35:00] cihan: Thanks, I will. I like 75200 because it has more mosfets and cheaper. Does spintend use higher quality components comparing makerbase? It also makes sense but I guess I cannot burn mosfets while they have double count.
[2023-11-10T22:35:46] puneDir: Yes it does
[2023-11-10T22:35:52] cihan: In JK I trust.) thanks again about it.
[2023-11-10T22:36:01] cihan: How?
[2023-11-10T22:36:18] puneDir: i pulled 35a batt and 120 phase It went üìâ
[2023-11-10T22:36:31] puneDir: somehow other vesc is fine
[2023-11-10T22:36:37] puneDir: It was dual config with g30
[2023-11-10T22:36:42] cihan: Are makerbase and Flipsky totally same with different branding?
[2023-11-10T22:36:53] puneDir: Not at all but simply yes
[2023-11-10T22:37:12] cihan: Sorry, I'll be back after a while, need to leave for a short time.
[2023-11-10T22:37:17] puneDir: makerbase box reads current wrong
[2023-11-10T22:37:29] puneDir: (with same fw with flipsky)
[2023-11-10T22:38:07] puneDir: my 16s battery still didnt burned
[2023-11-10T22:39:20] Mirono escooters: Not much
[2023-11-10T22:39:33] puneDir: I guess i maded a good job this time
[2023-11-10T22:39:55] puneDir: Still not 1000c
[2023-11-10T22:53:27] cihan: I asked earlier but will I need a throttle? I can use navee throttle or I can get a new throttle and sell all navee controller, cables, dashboard untouched.
[2023-11-10T22:54:59] cihan: And I still don't know how I'll turn on and off lights, in fact only rear light is enough. It can be on all the time but if I don't turn off scooter than light will be also on. I apologize for not reading VESC documentation before asking.
[2023-11-10T22:56:53] cihan: Best answer) There was a problem about 3.3V and 5V. I should learn more about that.
[2023-11-10T22:58:23] cihan: How can I know if navee dashboard is compatible or not? In fact I can omit the dashboard. At least I know that I don't need a dashboard to read voltage and speed, I don't need it.
[2023-11-10T23:00:43] cihan: By the way Offbondge headlight is good. I had one for a while but never used before, I used it today. It's probably about 2000-2500 lumens as I observe. In past I had a 1300 lumen light which is really 1300lm. It had very small reflector and I was unhappy with distracting drivers. New one is stronger but has much bigger reflector so now I probably distract drivers less.
[2023-11-10T23:01:11] cihan: What can I need dashboard for if I don't want to observe voltage, speed and battery level?
[2023-11-10T23:01:57] cihan: I really think about not having one. I'll place a clock there as some old fiat models had instead of RPM gauge.)
[2023-11-10T23:02:45] Happy Giraffe: Yes, less than 0.1v compared to my multimeter
[2023-11-10T23:05:07] cihan: I also think so. And if you want to see that car which didn't have RPM gauge but clock instead, it's the predecessor of the car in this music video.) https://youtu.be/-3P2USPFDcE?si=VsytfvFJbL-vVR-b
[2023-11-10T23:05:37] cihan: And which model is this VESC?
[2023-11-10T23:35:01] Happy Giraffe: Spintend 80v100 but honestly all decent vescs will provide accurate voltage data
[2023-11-10T23:40:35] cihan: Thanks. I think I won't push limits until I make a new battery so hopefully battery cut off won't be a problem for me unless voltage measurement is really off.
[2023-11-11T00:29:24] Happy Giraffe: Depends on where bms has the limit set, set vesc to reduce power when near limit to avoid unexpected cut

[2023-11-11T11:47:23] Happy Giraffe: It would be the first vesc that cant be opened then for cleaning. Find that hard to believe as haven't seen
[2023-11-11T11:47:33] Gabe Enzo: I'll try show you now
[2023-11-11T11:47:46] Mirono escooters: Bro you can open it

[2023-11-11T11:48:21] Gabe Enzo: Lol
[2023-11-11T11:48:47] Gabe Enzo: It seems my esc can only pickup one adc at once, maybe it's some bad solder idk
[2023-11-11T11:48:52] Gabe Enzo: Maybe it's fucked
[2023-11-11T11:48:52] Mirono escooters: In de wat
[2023-11-11T11:49:15] puneDir: you had to do current adc2 no reverse brake or whatever
[2023-11-11T11:49:36] Gabe Enzo: I'm switching back to 6.02 so I can work on It myself.
[2023-11-11T11:49:44] Gabe Enzo: I have, but I'll redo it all again

[2023-11-11T11:50:23] puneDir: When i first recieve it
[2023-11-11T11:50:43] Gabe Enzo: what can be the cause of an accelerator showing voltage but no value?
[2023-11-11T11:50:46] Gabe Enzo: Dead throttle?
[2023-11-11T11:51:15] Happy Giraffe: I always use atleast a weekend to solder cables properly and triple check wiring. Last thing to check that nothing shorts before connecting to battery
[2023-11-11T11:51:44] Gabe Enzo: A weekend? then my chance is now.
[2023-11-11T11:51:45] Happy Giraffe: Value during adc setup?

[2023-11-11T14:15:49] Mirono escooters: Oh god, get yourself together
[2023-11-11T14:16:10] Mirono escooters: So you spam us for a week with "not working, bla bla bla, this that"
[2023-11-11T14:16:15] Mirono escooters: And meanwhile you do that.
[2023-11-11T14:17:09] Gabe Enzo: throttle shows input but not brake. ill assume its bad and replace it now.
[2023-11-11T14:17:22] Gabe Enzo: ironically still the same issue
[2023-11-11T14:17:23] Gabe Enzo: LOL
[2023-11-11T14:17:27] Mirono escooters: You do you, but I don't want any more spam here about it Return when it works
[2023-11-11T14:33:02] Gabe Enzo: gas and brake work on 6.02, just so yall know.

[2023-11-11T15:57:43] Jhinzuo ~~: That wasn't the issue üòÖ he had done wiring wrong
[2023-11-11T15:59:51] Jhinzuo ~~: Being to fast and not checking everything over üòÇ
[2023-11-11T16:00:04] Jhinzuo ~~: Rushing everything so u miss things
[2023-11-11T16:00:23] Mirono escooters: Dr√∂ge
[2023-11-11T16:10:02] Happy Giraffe: My IQ has been lowered too many times in the group now(it wasnt high enough to start with), in need of a breaküôà
[2023-11-11T16:13:38] Gabe Enzo: anyone know why my esc just isn't saving settings? it's getting worrying.
[2023-11-11T16:13:49] Gabe Enzo: Everytime I turn it off I must redo every
[2023-11-11T16:13:55] Gabe Enzo: goddamn thing
[2023-11-11T16:13:57] Gabe Enzo: at least it works tho
[2023-11-11T16:14:15] Gabe Enzo: motor won't work unless I setup motor wizard every time üóø
[2023-11-11T16:15:20] Mirono escooters: Press da save button?
[2023-11-11T16:15:59] Gabe Enzo: under what tab is it in.
[2023-11-11T16:16:12] Gabe Enzo: write app config?
[2023-11-11T16:16:19] puneDir: alzheimer
[2023-11-11T16:16:23] puneDir: refund it
[2023-11-11T16:16:39] Gabe Enzo: cause I indeed do
[2023-11-11T16:16:39] Mirono escooters: Tab????
[2023-11-11T16:16:41] Gabe Enzo: ugh
[2023-11-11T16:16:45] Gabe Enzo: It better not be
[2023-11-11T16:16:56] Mirono escooters: It's most likely skill issue
[2023-11-11T16:17:53] Happy Giraffe: <sticker>
[2023-11-11T16:19:04] Mirono escooters: Who got a day or 3 spare to do that
[2023-11-11T16:19:11] Mirono escooters: Auto clicker üëÄ
[2023-11-11T16:24:38] Gabe Enzo: Bros i think it's an Alzheimer
[2023-11-11T16:24:54] Gabe Enzo: Still gonna go ride it tho
[2023-11-11T16:25:04] Gabe Enzo: Before I return it, if that's even possible.
[2023-11-11T16:25:12] Jhinzuo ~~: When I used Vesctool for you it was saving.
[2023-11-11T16:25:35] Gabe Enzo: It all saves, but the motor simply chops unless motor wizard is used upon startup.
[2023-11-11T16:25:41] Gabe Enzo: So something isn't saving.
[2023-11-11T16:26:02] Gabe Enzo: yeah motor totally freezes up
[2023-11-11T16:26:12] Gabe Enzo: hope so.
[2023-11-11T16:31:45] Gabe Enzo: The battery voltage and motor settings in particular are alzheimering.
[2023-11-11T16:31:46] Gabe Enzo: Nothing else.
[2023-11-11T16:33:09] Gabe Enzo: @jamessoderstrom my brakes turn into the throttle when I turn it on again LOL
[2023-11-11T16:35:33] Happy Giraffe: If you listen for once your setup can be done with a single message
[2023-11-11T16:38:01] Gabe Enzo: It doesn't show anything even when the motor and brakes are active. Voltage stays at min.
[2023-11-11T16:38:07] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_10871@11-11-2023_16-38-07.jpg>
[2023-11-11T16:39:28] Jhinzuo ~~: Kaputt
[2023-11-11T16:40:31] Gabe Enzo: Now works totally fine after I used motor wizard ü™Ñ
[2023-11-11T16:40:41] Gabe Enzo: Y'all can't call this skill issue now
[2023-11-11T16:40:44] Jhinzuo ~~: Go restart üëÄ
[2023-11-11T16:40:45] Gabe Enzo: It's hardware issue
[2023-11-11T16:42:50] Gabe Enzo: ITS THE VESC APP that's fucking it up. I disconnected BT and connected again and All settings got reset esc didn't even turn off.
[2023-11-11T16:43:33] Gabe Enzo: The app has an obsession with resetting motor settings.
[2023-11-11T16:43:40] Gabe Enzo: Must be a MACos problem.
[2023-11-11T16:44:20] Jhinzuo ~~: I can use win for you
[2023-11-11T16:44:50] Gabe Enzo: Sure after I get back from my ride.
[2023-11-11T16:44:51] Gabe Enzo: Foaming up the esc now.
[2023-11-11T16:48:32] Gabe Enzo: After using motor wizard they do lol. This entire conundrum is hella confusing.
[2023-11-11T16:49:11] Gabe Enzo: Y'all think I'm insane
[2023-11-11T16:50:10] Happy Giraffe: Show us the button(s) you press when saving settings for motor and throttle
[2023-11-11T16:51:06] Gabe Enzo: Write app config OK.
[2023-11-11T16:52:45] Mirono escooters: I can not get this Esc hot. At all

[2023-11-11T16:53:13] Happy Giraffe: Need to press these each time individually for motor and throttle
[2023-11-11T16:53:44] Happy Giraffe: Which one is it?
[2023-11-11T16:54:14] Happy Giraffe: This was using only throttle at 50% and not pedalling
[2023-11-11T16:55:27] Mirono escooters: 75100 alu

[2023-11-11T17:54:55] Mirono escooters: It's abs overcurrent, haha
[2023-11-11T17:55:04] Mirono escooters: Check what's it set to, in motor current tab

[2023-11-11T20:49:03] haku: thank you
[2023-11-11T20:57:46] Jan: The momentum caused by the handlebar is so low cause the distance to the point of failure is short. This is either crash or purposely breaking it by wiggling the handlebar AF until it broke. No way this is just from offroad riding. Any other scooter has at least double the momentum on the stem
[2023-11-11T21:01:00] Mirono escooters: I second this No way, that is from normal driving.
[2023-11-11T21:01:07] Mirono escooters: Also look where he was riding..

[2023-11-12T19:28:51] Mirono escooters: Corruption is probably it hahahah
[2023-11-12T19:30:17] Happy Giraffe: Buying a key switch like this to turn light on and to activate throttle to vesc. Then I could control both at one switch and lot let cops know about itüòÅ could just say throttle is not plugged inüòÅ

[2023-11-12T19:47:56] haku: hey folks do you know if this tire has a pmt equivalent
[2023-11-12T19:48:36] haku: i think it will fit on a 11" wheel 6.5
[2023-11-12T19:52:42] haku: i couldnt find it in the pmt website for some reason
[2023-11-12T19:52:52] JPPL: It feet's on 6.5 yes, completely different from PMT But also good tyre personal opinionyou should always check if you have space on scooter itself to handle such bit tyre, h√°s more diameter than all PMT
[2023-11-12T19:53:43] haku: thank you.
[2023-11-12T19:54:14] haku: these 2 rims is what im considering
[2023-11-12T19:54:15] haku: <photos/photo_10894@12-11-2023_19-54-15.jpg>
[2023-11-12T19:54:43] haku: would it fit both? yeah?
[2023-11-12T19:55:14] haku: i mean the one on the left
[2023-11-12T19:55:31] Mirono escooters: Well it lists wich tire it takes so?
[2023-11-12T19:56:14] haku: i mean the one on the left. would it fit? it has a 6.5 diameter too
[2023-11-12T19:56:45] Jhinzuo ~~: the left idk , the right one yes both 12x4-5-6.5
[2023-11-12T19:57:20] haku: ok thank you.
[2023-11-12T19:58:26] haku: i dont know if anyone here has tried fitting it on a 11 inch scooter. most rims are like the one on the left
[2023-11-12T20:05:10] JPPL: I use This as i think is original from LY motors, it fests both PMT or 12" . The second seems to fit ONLY 12" and top lage for PMT
[2023-11-12T20:06:15] JPPL: As PMT normally demands 66mm rim width
[2023-11-12T20:08:01] haku: gotcha. do you know the name of the pmt equivalent to that tire?
[2023-11-12T20:09:19] haku: do they even make that size?
[2023-11-12T20:09:24] Paolo ‚Å≠: Pmt dont prodices 11 inch

[2023-11-13T13:52:56] Nick: hypothetical but would a motor like this work on a motorcycle using chain drive
[2023-11-13T13:59:13] Jhinzuo ~~: You would need 230v for star an 400v for Delta to run this
[2023-11-13T14:01:24] Nick: So a 200a vesc probably wouldn't come close to cutting it I take it
[2023-11-13T14:02:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Its contrary ahhahs
[2023-11-13T14:03:56] Nick: This motor is from a vertical conveyor in a warehouse, supposed to be good I think for the weight of a car so I'm guessing low rpm but high torque. I'd be curious if it could be tuned to be violently powerful on a motorbike or a go-kart
[2023-11-13T14:04:30] Nick: Assuming I can even buy one from whoever lenze is
[2023-11-13T14:09:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: These motor are inefficient to be on Ev
[2023-11-13T14:10:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: The weight of the motor counts much on Ev, ans the w/kg is very bad compred to actually existing motor

[2023-11-13T14:48:14] Nick: Was thinking for my next project using it mounted facing forward either in another motorcycle or a side by side
[2023-11-13T14:48:49] Nick: Almost done the motorcycle I'm currently working on I just got my replacement ble module because I lost the other one while waiting for the battery to arrive lmao
[2023-11-13T14:49:28] Nick: Just need to re solder my qs8 and put the 8mm bullets on the motor wires and it'll be time to tune it

[2023-11-13T20:59:42] puneDir: How can i smooth izuna vesc lisp braking
[2023-11-13T20:59:54] puneDir: its not smooth
[2023-11-13T21:00:11] Mirono escooters: Wdym not smooth üòÇ
[2023-11-13T21:00:24] Mirono escooters: 6.05 and tune it, lol
[2023-11-13T21:00:34] puneDir: well we have a problem
[2023-11-13T21:00:50] puneDir: adc pins of my vesc just got under the resin
[2023-11-13T21:00:59] puneDir: so i cant connect to adc
[2023-11-13T21:01:03] Mirono escooters: Such a stupid idea
[2023-11-13T21:01:18] Mirono escooters: And why u need ADC? 6.05 ADC forwarding works..
[2023-11-13T21:01:29] puneDir: No the adc cable
[2023-11-13T21:01:44] puneDir: its like gas connected to dash but it works?
[2023-11-13T21:01:52] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-11-13T21:01:55] Mirono escooters: 6.02 is buggy
[2023-11-13T21:02:15] puneDir: thank you
[2023-11-13T21:02:22] puneDir: im going to update now
[2023-11-13T21:03:19] puneDir: im just scared of flash wear
[2023-11-13T21:03:59] puneDir: isnt the main thing odo
[2023-11-13T21:04:17] puneDir: i mean counting odo
[2023-11-13T21:05:08] puneDir: how many months it will take to have flash memory wear
[2023-11-13T21:16:06] haku: this new honda scooter will be fun to put a vesc on. alot of space
[2023-11-13T21:17:14] Mirono escooters: It's just a bad new motocompo
[2023-11-13T21:17:46] haku: this will sell well in the US for sure
[2023-11-13T21:19:04] haku: its very unique looking.
[2023-11-13T21:21:37] rosheee: and better build quality than tesla ^^
[2023-11-13T21:22:44] haku: i hope tesla would make a scooter too lol
[2023-11-13T21:23:54] haku: make it fit the front trunk space. that would be cool
[2023-11-13T21:39:23] haku: why do scooter companies never make scooters with vesc? it should be the best upgrade
[2023-11-13T21:40:37] haku: it shouldnt be a problem with liscencing because its open source.
[2023-11-13T21:45:09] Mirono escooters: Rion did
[2023-11-13T21:45:12] Mirono escooters: Also shitty company
[2023-11-13T21:45:21] Mirono escooters: Vesc is expensive They prefer china Esc üíÄüíÄ
[2023-11-13T21:48:54] haku: lots of premium scooters would be better with vesc. so sad they dont use it
[2023-11-13T21:51:03] haku: also vesc is as premium as it gets.
[2023-11-13T22:13:31] NetworkDir: If scooter companies can‚Äôt make scooter with vesc Vesc should make scooter company lol
[2023-11-13T22:37:38] Gabe Enzo: Whys my vesc showing my battery at 13%
[2023-11-13T22:37:43] Gabe Enzo: when my voltmeter is nominal
[2023-11-13T22:37:50] Gabe Enzo: It should clearly be 50
[2023-11-13T22:58:09] Happy Giraffe: Wrong setting on battery tab I guess
[2023-11-13T23:29:19] Eric Howat: Hey all anyone know what wires to use on a QS-S4 throttle? Buddys trying to wire it up with a flipsky
[2023-11-13T23:30:13] Mirono escooters: ADC 3.3v and gnd?
[2023-11-13T23:32:32] Gabe Enzo: 20s 70v
[2023-11-13T23:32:51] Gabe Enzo: Scooter cut out
[2023-11-13T23:32:54] Gabe Enzo: while I was outside
[2023-11-13T23:33:01] Gabe Enzo: Maybe BMS
[2023-11-13T23:33:04] Gabe Enzo: but it's 40a
[2023-11-13T23:33:08] Gabe Enzo: make no sense
[2023-11-13T23:33:11] Gabe Enzo: Probably
[2023-11-13T23:33:19] Gabe Enzo: was at 15% back the
[2023-11-13T23:33:20] Gabe Enzo: then
[2023-11-13T23:33:45] Gabe Enzo: so it's normal?
[2023-11-13T23:33:51] Gabe Enzo: also it's cold outside
[2023-11-13T23:33:58] Gabe Enzo: BMS might have cut out
[2023-11-13T23:34:05] Gabe Enzo: cause low voltage
[2023-11-13T23:34:07] Gabe Enzo: Yep
[2023-11-13T23:34:32] Gabe Enzo: Yes ignition shows 1v
[2023-11-13T23:35:20] Gabe Enzo: Imma seal the scooter soon
[2023-11-13T23:35:26] Gabe Enzo: so it's like factory made
[2023-11-13T23:35:45] Gabe Enzo: and make a charging port
[2023-11-13T23:35:47] Gabe Enzo: forgot lmao
[2023-11-13T23:36:20] Gabe Enzo: Why exactly does that happen
[2023-11-14T00:38:10] Eric Howat: How do you wire a switch in for power on a flipsky 75100?
[2023-11-14T00:38:29] Eric Howat: Ps not a flipsky fan lol but buddy is looking to set his up
[2023-11-14T00:41:36] Eric Howat: How does it operate then? It‚Äôs always on?
[2023-11-14T01:17:01] Jan: Is antispark worth it?
[2023-11-14T01:17:03] Jan: üòÖüòÖ
[2023-11-14T01:17:27] Jan: I like the little boom and arc when you plug it in üòÇ
[2023-11-14T01:25:37] haku: spinted recomends anti spark on thier esc.
[2023-11-14T03:27:21] haku: @jamessoderstrom shouldnt the dual 100/100 v2 come with Qs8 connectors? or is it better to solder another xt90 in parralel?
[2023-11-14T06:14:20] Happy Giraffe: New vescs have dedicated NFR BT port but we cant benefit from it as you can't choose ADC with UART and PAS on app. With the bottom option you still lose bluetooth because of the softwareüò≠ I could have wired the PAS wires from my torque sensor for smoother cruising
[2023-11-14T06:22:18] Happy Giraffe: Or does "always on UART" somehow keep BT running still?
[2023-11-14T07:18:15] Happy Giraffe: Cool, next time I do some electrical work on it will solder PAS cables and see what happensüòÇ
[2023-11-14T07:52:05] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Also no cc possible in adc + uart
[2023-11-14T08:14:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yep can happen , also need to enable it
[2023-11-14T09:17:26] Happy Giraffe: Grr, we got the hardware now. Need to enable all at the same time in software nextüòÅ Vedder pls
[2023-11-14T12:19:34] Unknown: Just fixed this issue. Trying changing the temperature sensor type.
[2023-11-14T12:24:45] Unknown: & also battery S count. I have a 20s battery that charges to 84v but had to set as lithium 4.2 & series count to 17s
[2023-11-14T12:44:52] Gabe Enzo: Why are those related
[2023-11-14T12:45:01] Gabe Enzo: oh interesting
[2023-11-14T12:45:22] Gabe Enzo: Do you get less power then?
[2023-11-14T12:57:24] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: I can tell
[2023-11-14T12:58:04] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Ppl dont read than act up while dumb , that's why Think twice or more ,avoid crying
[2023-11-14T13:00:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Really no idea why you could not set it
[2023-11-14T13:01:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Reading makes flipsky cheap,not reading makes it atleast spintend price ü§£
[2023-11-14T14:44:32] Finn: I have a question about windings on a motor. This is a xiaomi 1s motor with 6 parralel wires for one phase and 9 series windings. Also it has 30 motor poles and 27 overall windings. Whats the right term to express it?
[2023-11-14T15:57:58] Gabe Enzo: @LizardDoggo can the 80100 run 22s?
[2023-11-14T16:16:02] Finn: <photos/photo_10910@14-11-2023_16-16-02.jpg>
[2023-11-14T16:16:03] Finn: ?
[2023-11-14T16:17:22] S1m 0n: 580‚Ç¨ for a small single Motor ? üò±
[2023-11-14T16:17:45] Mirono escooters: Not smol
[2023-11-14T16:18:10] Mirono escooters: But still pricey
[2023-11-14T16:18:23] S1m 0n: How big IT can be, for a Skateboard ?
[2023-11-14T16:18:33] NetworkDir: I dont think
[2023-11-14T16:18:55] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Go cart
[2023-11-14T16:18:59] Mirono escooters: 130kv and 22s? Fun
[2023-11-14T16:19:17] NetworkDir: Max 20s safe But components is 100V
[2023-11-14T16:19:54] NetworkDir: I think he mean ubox 80V 100A
[2023-11-14T16:25:20] Finn: Safe for 20s
[2023-11-14T16:25:28] Finn: @jamessoderstrom
[2023-11-14T16:25:34] Finn: <photos/photo_10911@14-11-2023_16-25-34.jpg>
[2023-11-14T16:25:36] Finn: First welds
[2023-11-14T16:25:41] Finn: Aluminium
[2023-11-14T16:25:45] NetworkDir: Yep
[2023-11-14T16:38:21] sombre_enfant: It read 20s?
[2023-11-14T16:38:24] Gabe Enzo: Yes
[2023-11-14T16:38:33] Gabe Enzo: With no limit flash
[2023-11-14T16:45:08] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: First try more like ,but üëç let's go show us some joints later on
[2023-11-14T16:47:23] Finn: It was on my dads work
[2023-11-14T16:47:34] Finn: <video_file>
[2023-11-14T16:47:42] Finn: Welded the frame for @kawaiinekololis
[2023-11-14T16:55:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Great üëç But just a word if you dont mind ,better show before after in vids like this,while you dont rush coz i would say was too fast even in slow mode ,if you even have that in single tgü§îü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ
[2023-11-14T17:00:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Older kugoo stem weld right afterwards
[2023-11-14T17:00:35] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: So your dad is welder? Or similar
[2023-11-14T19:12:06] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_10912@14-11-2023_19-12-06.jpg>
[2023-11-14T19:12:33] puneDir: Can you measure motor with this
[2023-11-14T19:12:37] NetworkDir: Like burned motor
[2023-11-14T19:12:43] NetworkDir: Dc motors yes
[2023-11-14T19:14:02] Mirono escooters: Tf is this now
[2023-11-14T19:14:30] Mirono escooters: Your vesc does it, why bother : D
[2023-11-14T19:14:54] NetworkDir: Lcr-t4 components tester
[2023-11-14T19:15:35] puneDir: My vesc measures voltage 1.3v more
[2023-11-14T19:16:26] Mirono escooters: So you measure a brushed DC motor, and why send? I fail to see the point
[2023-11-14T19:16:30] Mirono escooters: Can adjust or live with it
[2023-11-14T19:16:33] puneDir: <photos/photo_10914@14-11-2023_19-16-33.jpg>
[2023-11-14T19:16:36] puneDir: Actually 2.3
[2023-11-14T19:16:44] puneDir: How can i adjust
[2023-11-14T19:20:58] NetworkDir: Maybe someone needs to easy to use tester like lcr-t4 I introduced it, maybe someone will use it
[2023-11-14T19:21:14] NetworkDir: Like testing mosfet & capacitors
[2023-11-14T19:38:57] Oreo huzky: Gonna be faster than the speed of sound
[2023-11-14T19:44:19] Mirono escooters: Needs sum tiny wheels and gearing
[2023-11-14T21:18:00] haku: would you guys rather have 11 inch pmt or 12 inch china touvt tire. the extra inch would be really cool to have
[2023-11-14T21:21:50] JPPL: Personally 11", better curve, faster takeoff, but both are good, if you really want that extra inch you will fell it
[2023-11-14T21:25:25] haku: our roads here have a lot of small cracks and bumps. im using a fake pmt 11 tire right now and i can feel it some times. have you tried both 11 and 12?
[2023-11-14T21:27:16] haku: im sure the traction on the pmt is amazing. i wish they made 12"
[2023-11-14T21:30:07] JPPL: I tried both, they are similar, to reduce bumps I noticed that is better with no air tube. Tubeless feels more confortable all the time, right pressure and good shocking system üòÅ
[2023-11-14T21:30:29] JPPL: That's the combo
[2023-11-14T21:32:15] haku: thank you for the suggestion
[2023-11-14T21:33:21] haku: i think i will go with 12 this time there are 2 rim choices.
[2023-11-14T21:33:22] haku: <photos/photo_10894@12-11-2023_19-54-15.jpg>
[2023-11-14T21:46:22] Oreo huzky: Do you have link ?
[2023-11-14T21:48:16] haku: Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! $100.00 | LONNYO Split Motor with Tubeless Tyre 11-14inch 1000w-6000w 75mm Magnet High-Power/Speed/Torque Electric Scooter Engines https://a.aliexpress.com/_mNYZ8oM
[2023-11-14T21:49:20] haku: different rim sizes to choose from. i thought 6.5 diameter is universal but i gues not
[2023-11-14T21:50:35] haku: i did not buy that motor btw. just the rim. i choose a different one
[2023-11-14T22:12:56] Oreo huzky: Thankies
[2023-11-14T22:13:20] Oreo huzky: Was just curious about the motor specs
[2023-11-14T22:14:20] Oreo huzky: Motor Single Magnet or dual?
[2023-11-14T22:14:26] haku: i choose the 70h. that is the most can fit on a 150mm dropout
[2023-11-14T22:15:18] Oreo huzky: Same same I was just curious because I‚Äôm planning on building one with 80h or 85h magnet
[2023-11-14T22:15:34] Oreo huzky: What kv do you have?
[2023-11-14T22:15:38] haku: <photos/photo_10917@14-11-2023_22-15-38.jpg>
[2023-11-14T22:16:45] haku: these are just parts im picking up for what im building. im not sure what battery i will br making either 21s or 20s. 350a peak
[2023-11-14T22:17:40] Oreo huzky: What frame do you use?
[2023-11-14T22:18:06] haku: eh. you will not like my answer. ill be using laotie ti30 frame
[2023-11-14T22:18:30] Oreo huzky: Me to brotha
[2023-11-14T22:18:33] Oreo huzky: <photos/photo_10918@14-11-2023_22-18-33.jpg>
[2023-11-14T22:18:51] haku: awsome bro
[2023-11-14T22:18:54] Oreo huzky: But modified frame a bit
[2023-11-14T22:19:25] haku: im getting alot of hate on that scoot unfortunately. but its been good to me so far
[2023-11-14T22:20:26] haku: nice looking back end there
[2023-11-14T22:20:33] Oreo huzky: Yea same didn‚Äôt had any problems so far only downside is battery bay a bit small but it‚Äôs fine and also dropout bit shitty
[2023-11-14T22:20:51] Oreo huzky: https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGe17xT8t/
[2023-11-14T22:20:56] Oreo huzky: With weld
[2023-11-14T22:21:27] haku: dam thats cool.
[2023-11-14T22:21:51] haku: what tire is that?
[2023-11-14T22:21:54] Oreo huzky: And also added foot step at the end and bend rear (as spoiler)
[2023-11-14T22:22:10] Oreo huzky: Biggest pmt you can get don‚Äôt know the actual size
[2023-11-14T22:22:19] Oreo huzky: But it‚Äôs nice
[2023-11-14T22:22:21] haku: gotcha
[2023-11-14T22:22:37] Oreo huzky: But get steering damper
[2023-11-14T22:23:40] haku: good work bro. i really got sucked in to this scootering. so many possibilities
[2023-11-14T22:24:32] Oreo huzky: Yes but can be a bit exhausting I have to repair my cl350 now a second time because it randomly decided to die idk what the fault was
[2023-11-14T22:25:16] Oreo huzky: But it‚Äôs nice you can diy a lot of stuff
[2023-11-14T22:26:28] Oreo huzky: Like these they where a pain In the ass to make but ended out nicely
[2023-11-14T22:28:09] Oreo huzky: May I ask where you from ?
[2023-11-14T22:29:52] haku: nevada, US you?
[2023-11-14T22:30:12] Oreo huzky: Germany

[2023-11-14T22:36:51] haku: ill pm you bro
[2023-11-15T00:11:33] cihan: Flipsky antispark switch has voltage limitation, is that really so?
[2023-11-15T00:13:17] Mirono escooters: A voltage sensor that refuses to turn on above x voltage? Sounds fair
[2023-11-15T00:15:22] cihan: Probably, I'm not sure. I still don't know how to switch on and off with current switch or without such an antispark switch. I need precharge circuit, I don't want sparks.) Does JK BMS have such soft start function?
[2023-11-15T00:16:18] Mirono escooters: Doesn't jkbms have a button mode?
[2023-11-15T00:16:22] Mirono escooters: So you don't need antispark
[2023-11-15T00:16:46] Mirono escooters: Llt has soft start Jkbms Problably too, even Daly had hahaha
[2023-11-15T00:18:23] cihan: Yes, I meant it.
[2023-11-15T00:18:44] Mirono escooters: Llt had
[2023-11-15T00:18:49] Mirono escooters: Oh sorry, ant
[2023-11-15T00:18:51] cihan: Do you set current limit with that button mode for llt and Dally?
[2023-11-15T00:18:59] Mirono escooters: Ant yes My brain doodoo
[2023-11-15T00:19:08] Mirono escooters: No you turn output on off
[2023-11-15T00:19:16] Mirono escooters: Saved my mp2
[2023-11-15T00:19:28] Mirono escooters: A ceramic cap failed , short circuit Had a small arc with precharge Otherwise..
[2023-11-15T00:19:41] Mirono escooters: And it went in error, because precharge failed. Very smart.
[2023-11-15T00:20:50] cihan: And do you have an option to set current limit? Doesn't it still spark if you cannot limit that current?
[2023-11-15T00:24:09] cihan: So you don't use anything to limit current when switching on and leave it always on?
[2023-11-15T00:29:44] cihan: Does spintend have its own precharge circuit inside?
[2023-11-15T00:41:25] cihan: That's nice, thanks for the information.

[2023-11-15T00:48:41] Paolo ‚Å≠: No it dont has
[2023-11-15T00:49:32] Paolo ‚Å≠: Old 75v 100a with fdbl has it
[2023-11-15T00:50:30] Paolo ‚Å≠: Single
[2023-11-15T00:51:03] Paolo ‚Å≠: But after they removed and simply send for free xt90s
[2023-11-15T00:51:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Flipsky üòÇ
[2023-11-15T00:51:43] Paolo ‚Å≠: Some their esc has antispark circuit included
[2023-11-15T00:51:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: On board i mean
[2023-11-15T00:52:07] cihan: I also wonder
[2023-11-15T00:52:23] Paolo ‚Å≠: Let me check, was likely 60v 100a x 2
[2023-11-15T00:54:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: They removed it and implemented on off of the converter finally hahaha
[2023-11-15T00:57:00] cihan: Is it fine if I build a simple precharge circuit and add it to controller?
[2023-11-15T00:57:14] cihan: Then I'll use a simple switch to turn on and off.
[2023-11-15T00:58:56] Paolo ‚Å≠: You can direct solder some resistance to the original circuit then it will works
[2023-11-15T01:01:42] cihan: I used to see implementation of it in some photos before, thanks. I think it's best cheap solution.
[2023-11-15T02:19:26] Happy Giraffe: Oh yes pls, but the thermal design must be spot on...Not nice to see 80¬∞c after 10 secondsüòÇ
[2023-11-15T02:42:25] Happy Giraffe: Yeah and pls no cooling through a part that doesnt make/not possible to mount with contact to vehicle frameüòÇ
[2023-11-15T02:42:55] Happy Giraffe: I still have PTSD from first gen single as I realized it has cooling upside downüôà
[2023-11-15T02:48:13] Happy Giraffe: Also would be nice to have dual 12v3A output. One for main lights and one for accessories etc

[2023-11-15T12:45:10] Oreo huzky: Bigger motor
[2023-11-15T12:50:33] Happy Giraffe: I doubt it

[2023-11-15T12:55:29] Jan: Dafuq how you need 500a per vesc?
[2023-11-15T12:55:54] Jan: 200a is already beyond anything
[2023-11-15T12:56:25] haku: not me just wondering. they were talking about it earlier. i think for a ebike
[2023-11-15T12:56:51] haku: qs273 and 500a vesc would be cool
[2023-11-15T13:15:37] Happy Giraffe: QS138 or 273üòÇ

[2023-11-15T13:19:36] haku: phase was what i was thinking
[2023-11-15T13:20:16] Jan: I never ever speak of phase, it makes no sense to measure any power with it
[2023-11-15T13:20:33] Jan: Its a sinewave
[2023-11-15T13:22:02] Gabe Enzo: I agree 100%. it makes no sense to even speak of phase.
[2023-11-15T13:22:13] Gabe Enzo: I mean most of the time.
[2023-11-15T13:23:58] haku: but thats how you get 20kwatts on youtube

[2023-11-15T13:24:40] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-11-15T13:24:50] Mirono escooters: 20kw isn't even that hard, but they are too dumb to know
[2023-11-15T13:30:47] haku: i was just saying how these youtubers claim 10kw-20kw builds. üòÇ
[2023-11-15T13:31:40] haku: oh my bad
[2023-11-15T13:32:17] Jan: The question is can i ? batteryamps=Phaseamps/Sqrt(3)
[2023-11-15T13:32:28] Mirono escooters: Non
[2023-11-15T13:32:36] NetworkDir: None
[2023-11-15T13:33:35] Jan: Yes but the energy you transfer through the esc is roughly the same minus efficiency
[2023-11-15T13:33:36] Mirono escooters: Now you lost me
[2023-11-15T13:33:49] Jan: Phase amps is a sinewave
[2023-11-15T13:33:59] Mirono escooters: And if you look on it on a scope, it's not a sine wave at all, it's pwm
[2023-11-15T13:34:08] haku: youtube math is wrong then. i have to stop believing them
[2023-11-15T13:34:09] Mirono escooters: But it's "a sine wave" on paper
[2023-11-15T13:34:12] Jan: Yes but different sinewave frequency i suppose?
[2023-11-15T13:34:15] Mirono escooters: Moh
[2023-11-15T13:34:37] Jan: in foc its roughly a sinewave
[2023-11-15T13:34:38] NetworkDir: The square wave chinese controllers phase how i can calculate
[2023-11-15T13:34:47] Mirono escooters: On paper, yes
[2023-11-15T13:34:51] Mirono escooters: If you draw it out
[2023-11-15T13:34:57] Mirono escooters: But it's a pwm signal, look on oscilloscope
[2023-11-15T13:35:06] Mirono escooters: It's not limited, hahahaha
[2023-11-15T13:35:12] NetworkDir: Lol
[2023-11-15T13:35:13] Mirono escooters: It's limited by stray resistances
[2023-11-15T13:35:24] NetworkDir: Hmm
[2023-11-15T13:35:26] Mirono escooters: You have infinite phase amps at 0 start, theoretically.
[2023-11-15T13:35:47] Mirono escooters: Thats why "square wave has so much power on start, I love it, sine wave suck" ppl
[2023-11-15T13:35:53] Jan: The controller only makes a sinewave from DC
[2023-11-15T13:36:03] Jan: So why can i not invert the equation?
[2023-11-15T13:36:04] Mirono escooters: With pwm
[2023-11-15T13:36:20] Mirono escooters: It's not that simple equation
[2023-11-15T13:36:26] NetworkDir: But sinewave faster and more powerful at start
[2023-11-15T13:36:34] Mirono escooters: We touched it in education, but didn't go this deep, it's so complicated
[2023-11-15T13:36:40] Mirono escooters: Wrong
[2023-11-15T13:36:46] Mirono escooters: Square more powerful at start
[2023-11-15T13:36:54] Mirono escooters: Due to higher peaks
[2023-11-15T13:37:08] NetworkDir: Max duty 100% Ramp time 0ms Lol
[2023-11-15T13:37:17] Mirono escooters: You do you, I talk science
[2023-11-15T13:37:18] Jan: <files/image (5).png>
[2023-11-15T13:37:21] Mirono escooters: Not "feeling"
[2023-11-15T13:37:30] Mirono escooters: Three phase ac
[2023-11-15T13:37:42] Jan: Yes which is any brushless motor
[2023-11-15T13:37:49] Mirono escooters: Pwm DC
[2023-11-15T13:38:04] Jan: PWM DC= roughly sinewave ac here
[2023-11-15T13:38:27] Jan: <files/image (6).png>
[2023-11-15T13:38:37] Mirono escooters: If you draw it out
[2023-11-15T13:38:49] Mirono escooters: Yes, that's what I mean
[2023-11-15T13:39:02] Jan: I can use a sinewave for a calculation
[2023-11-15T13:39:05] Mirono escooters: But your frequency is closely matched to the magnets
[2023-11-15T13:39:25] Mirono escooters: So you can not compare it like that to 3 phase net
[2023-11-15T13:40:29] Jan: Does it really matter? I mean its just a riemann sum under it, no matter the frequency
[2023-11-15T13:40:38] Mirono escooters: Yes it does
[2023-11-15T13:40:51] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-11-15T13:40:55] Jan: Explain
[2023-11-15T13:41:01] Gabe Enzo: Yep.
[2023-11-15T13:41:22] Gabe Enzo: Can't be.
[2023-11-15T13:41:31] Jan: I think it is theoretically calculateable
[2023-11-15T13:42:01] Mirono escooters: That's why 6 fet
[2023-11-15T13:42:13] Mirono escooters: Positive negative 3 phase
[2023-11-15T13:42:17] Gabe Enzo: What is max duty?
[2023-11-15T13:42:26] Gabe Enzo: Yeah some say √∑3 or √∑2
[2023-11-15T13:43:45] NetworkDir: Max throttle limit
[2023-11-15T13:44:18] Mirono escooters: Huh
[2023-11-15T13:44:29] Mirono escooters: Well that's one way to explain it
[2023-11-15T13:45:34] Jan: Yes, i think so
[2023-11-15T13:46:13] Mirono escooters: Actually no, far from, duty can be low with max throttlr
[2023-11-15T13:46:29] Jan: You dont know voltage to calculate power yet
[2023-11-15T13:46:32] Mirono escooters: Ah mb, yes like that
[2023-11-15T13:46:36] Mirono escooters: I understood wrong
[2023-11-15T13:46:40] Jan: Voltage would also imply a sinewave
[2023-11-15T13:47:14] Jan: I guess voltage is also a sinewave
[2023-11-15T13:47:18] Face de Pin Suc√©: Well, phase current is important, speaking of power is nonsense, you can have 200A phase and 200A battery versus 500A phase and 200A battery, same power, but not same acceleration at all
[2023-11-15T13:48:37] Jan: Yeah but if you think about it over an energy equation. The battery provides the same energy to the controller, the only difference can be motor efficiency different with different phase currents at certain speeds
[2023-11-15T13:49:01] Face de Pin Suc√©: that means you have to talk about both currents, not only one ;)
[2023-11-15T13:49:04] haku: this is what i was thinking too
[2023-11-15T13:50:22] Jan: Agree but that wasnt the initial question of would it be possible to calculate power from phase current. I argue, yes if you also know phase voltage, but the equation is much more complicated then just multiplying both
[2023-11-15T13:50:39] haku: but keep going fellas. im learning alot from you guys
[2023-11-15T13:50:52] Mirono escooters: Yes, but if ppl use phase amps to calculate kw we throwing handsüò∂
[2023-11-15T13:51:12] Jan: just phase amps to calculate power is not possible
[2023-11-15T13:52:41] Jan: You can always argue over conservation of energy: Power = Battery amps * Battery voltage = Phase amps * Phase voltage? * ?? (some factor of the integral of the sinewave i guess)
[2023-11-15T13:53:22] Jan: Implying 100% controller efficiency which is not, you will loose some to heat in the conversion
[2023-11-15T13:53:34] Jan: But roughly i guess that has to be somewhat the formula
[2023-11-15T13:54:14] Jan: Im no electrical engineer but from energy equations that makes the most sense to me
[2023-11-15T13:54:29] Jan: @KenLawrence knows a lot here
[2023-11-15T13:55:04] Mirono escooters: That's.. what I said?
[2023-11-15T13:55:09] Mirono escooters: That's what started this chat
[2023-11-15T13:55:58] Jan: Yeah agree but i argue its not impossible to calculate power from phase amps
[2023-11-15T13:56:09] Mirono escooters: I never said impossible
[2023-11-15T13:56:13] Jan: ok
[2023-11-15T13:56:18] Mirono escooters: I said: hard and unlogical
[2023-11-15T13:56:41] Jan: Still would be nice to know the formula for phase amps to power
[2023-11-15T13:57:30] Mirono escooters: My knowledge ends here, that's electrical engineering field, wich I have yet to complete
[2023-11-15T13:57:39] Mirono escooters: Gotta be honest when you ran out of knowledge hahaha
[2023-11-15T14:10:35] Mirono escooters: I never made logs yet, only screen record

[2023-11-15T14:25:50] haku: i cant really contribute much here. just learning is all
[2023-11-15T14:25:55] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: If phase then c/cl700 (depends on voltage, c700 has much less fets resistance with 100v fets), trampa str500, flipsky 75350 If battery current then c1000/cl1000, c1400/cl1400
[2023-11-15T14:26:51] Mirono escooters: Flipsky 75350 Finally ok?
[2023-11-15T14:28:04] NetworkDir: 75300 dont have a cutoff problem?
[2023-11-15T14:28:10] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: I wouldn't take it for these purposes anyway. Maybe it works a little with 500a phase

[2023-11-15T14:49:55] Mirono escooters: Some people shouldn't reproduce Red on red, can't be this hard.
[2023-11-15T14:50:14] haku: he needs xt90 antispark
[2023-11-15T14:50:20] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Yeah i love it also
[2023-11-15T14:50:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Would not help
[2023-11-15T14:50:31] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Clearly shorted
[2023-11-15T14:50:39] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Than he even push deeper
[2023-11-15T14:50:39] haku: it was a joke lol
[2023-11-15T14:51:26] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Open a kugoo ,all same colors some time ,
[2023-11-15T14:51:37] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-11-15T14:51:37] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: But there is other lovely stuff
[2023-11-15T14:51:44] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: G2 vs g2
[2023-11-15T14:51:46] Mirono escooters: Kugoo no reference
[2023-11-15T14:52:02] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Battery different,led module different
[2023-11-15T14:52:09] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Knows the same
[2023-11-15T14:53:06] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Kugoo i only bother ,coz thats always a challengeü§£
[2023-11-15T14:53:52] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: And when in you really run into the street of this ,you face this shit even has clones üôàüôàüôà
[2023-11-15T14:54:28] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: There is always lower it seems
[2023-11-15T14:56:07] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Pretty sad that shit like this exist,but hey tell me if i am wrong But compared to this flipsky is elit ,not to mention anything else
[2023-11-15T15:06:28] Konstantin: Order 1, wayting, 5-7 days and probably will see in table what is it..
[2023-11-15T15:07:06] Konstantin: And only for this brothers chat
[2023-11-15T15:07:21] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Great!
[2023-11-15T15:08:16] Konstantin: Flipsky 75/100 and 75/200 Only PRO 2 version has:: On/off Bluetooth module on board And...phase filters!!
[2023-11-15T15:14:19] Konstantin: And I'm not sure on 99%, but looks like 75350 gas phase filters too

[2023-11-15T15:18:33] Konstantin: Y
[2023-11-15T15:19:51] Happy Giraffe: I guess motor kv could also be a part there if not calculating by duty%
[2023-11-15T15:21:43] Jan: Hmm i would guess since we just measure controller input to output, there is nothing to be connected to the controller yet for the measurement
[2023-11-15T15:22:09] Mirono escooters: Really?
[2023-11-15T15:22:14] Mirono escooters: They improving
[2023-11-15T15:22:20] Happy Giraffe: Need to ask VedderüòÇ
[2023-11-15T15:22:26] Jan: ^^
[2023-11-15T16:09:19] Konstantin: Y, on pro V2 ;)
[2023-11-15T16:10:27] Mirono escooters: Cutoff issue still present?
[2023-11-15T16:58:07] Mirono escooters: Anyone care to help me flash nrf51822 chip? I can not seem to figure it out. Openocd is doing my head in, and flashing the hex with stlink utility doesn't do it.
[2023-11-15T16:58:21] Mirono escooters: Vedder is great at building stuff, but documentation is a bit bareüòß
[2023-11-15T17:05:09] Happy Giraffe: Especially advanced features lack explanation. Could atleast make a pdf sheet explaining the features bit more deeply. Takes maybe 1-2 days to write that...
[2023-11-15T17:09:16] Mirono escooters: Would be very cool
[2023-11-15T17:11:08] Mirono escooters: If i had knowledge, I'd do it
[2023-11-15T17:17:51] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, without proper information all the fancy adjustable features are wasted!
[2023-11-15T17:18:21] Happy Giraffe: Smart engineers can be quite stubborn to do office work but its sometimes necessary

[2023-11-15T18:02:58] Mirono escooters: Considering it's working, id say it is
[2023-11-15T18:03:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: No
[2023-11-15T18:03:08] Mirono escooters: Idk why you said bad range I get pretty far
[2023-11-15T18:03:19] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because vesc see the ble
[2023-11-15T18:03:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: But crashes
[2023-11-15T18:03:28] Mirono escooters: I'm literally writing to it now
[2023-11-15T18:03:51] Mirono escooters: Yes, I can record if you dont believe
[2023-11-15T18:03:53] Paolo ‚Å≠: And works with 10m ?
[2023-11-15T18:03:57] Mirono escooters: With a metal/beton wall

[2023-11-15T18:04:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: No i need see when you running escooter , theres thebproblem
[2023-11-15T18:04:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: It crashes
[2023-11-15T18:05:04] Paolo ‚Å≠: I dont know if the circuit is worse or what
[2023-11-15T18:05:05] Mirono escooters: That's noise related?
[2023-11-15T18:05:09] Paolo ‚Å≠: Maybe
[2023-11-15T18:05:12] Mirono escooters: Add a 10uF ceramic cap, solved
[2023-11-15T18:05:14] Paolo ‚Å≠: But dont happens wirh black one
[2023-11-15T18:05:17] Mirono escooters: Vedder himself said
[2023-11-15T18:05:23] Mirono escooters: Black? The bigger?
[2023-11-15T18:05:26] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2023-11-15T18:05:39] Mirono escooters: I will run the qs273 with this, if that doesn't make enough noise
[2023-11-15T18:05:41] Mirono escooters: We will see
[2023-11-15T18:05:52] Paolo ‚Å≠: Why not sur ron üò¢
[2023-11-15T18:06:44] Mirono escooters: Because I'm poor and don't like surron

[2023-11-15T18:20:11] Mirono escooters: Ahahahaha, ya
[2023-11-15T18:20:16] Mirono escooters: MP2 only has 8 "Only"

[2023-11-15T18:45:49] Mirono escooters: Oh oh
[2023-11-15T18:45:53] Mirono escooters: Jan is gonna kick u
[2023-11-15T18:46:24] JPPL: No fans allowed? üòú
[2023-11-15T18:48:53] Jan: üò±üò±üò±üò±üò±
[2023-11-15T18:49:01] Jan: Blasphemious
[2023-11-15T18:50:15] Jan: So much wrong with it
[2023-11-15T18:50:21] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-11-15T18:50:24] Mirono escooters: He's here
[2023-11-15T18:51:03] Happy Giraffe: One I showed was 13-14kg, this is 20üòÇ maybe wider stator etc
[2023-11-15T18:51:47] Jan: These fans are flow optimized and not pressure, you restrict any possible airflow. The air has nowhere to go as you have zero outlets for the air and only inlets which leads to a airflow stall in 0.1sec. They are only decorative
[2023-11-15T18:52:28] Jan: Im no admin so i must allow it to exist for now üò¨üò¨
[2023-11-15T18:53:50] Happy Giraffe: 100% agree with the fans. Doesnt help at all here. Only use would be components in a board that cant be cooled in any other way and that would require special design to force airflow in a wanted path
[2023-11-15T18:53:59] Mirono escooters: You need a (idk English word name) pressure fan
[2023-11-15T18:54:10] Mirono escooters: No fan rules, yet
[2023-11-15T18:54:53] Happy Giraffe: Those for radiators
[2023-11-15T18:55:45] Jan: The only usecase for a scooter fan i can think of is pulling heavy trailers uphill with a scooter that requires insane amount of current but you never exceed 10kmh
[2023-11-15T18:55:46] Happy Giraffe: Gamers Nexus youtube channel is very good information when he reviews motherboards or coolers etc
[2023-11-15T18:56:06] Jan: But then you cannot do it in the way it is shown in the picture
[2023-11-15T18:56:07] Mirono escooters: Or for akf filters
[2023-11-15T18:56:44] Jan: Than fan must create the airflow over the heatsink that your low speed cannot provide
[2023-11-15T18:57:16] Jan: Like on a car
[2023-11-15T18:57:17] Jan: <files/image (8).png>
[2023-11-15T18:57:31] Jan: where the fan is for zero to low speeds to create that artificial airflow
[2023-11-15T18:57:40] Jan: else the air from driving is cooling it
[2023-11-15T18:57:44] Happy Giraffe: Yup on pic it does only intake that could be naturally by wind anyways. Could work as an exhaust out in the rear
[2023-11-15T18:58:10] Jan: The flow a fan provides is far less than any winds at 30kph+
[2023-11-15T18:58:18] Happy Giraffe: But then components inside would not really benefit itüòÇ
[2023-11-15T18:58:19] puneDir: <photos/photo_10939@15-11-2023_18-58-19.jpg>
[2023-11-15T18:58:52] puneDir: @Mirono_escooters mosfet dead opamp dead shunt resistor dead diodes dead some resistors are exploded Wish me luck
[2023-11-15T18:59:00] Happy Giraffe: Yeah, fans are nice to cool down esc during traffic lights but really hard to implement and not waterproof
[2023-11-15T19:00:18] Jan: Yeah you can implement it somewhat waterproof
[2023-11-15T19:00:35] Happy Giraffe: But a large surface area with good thermal design would still come on top I think. If mosfet heat is conducted well to frame you have 10kg alu mass heatsinküòÅ
[2023-11-15T19:00:38] Jan: The floor plate is a rectangular tube instead of just a plate
[2023-11-15T19:01:48] Mirono escooters: Shitty charger, super little components.
[2023-11-15T19:03:13] Jan: <files/image (9).png>
[2023-11-15T19:03:15] Happy Giraffe: I wonder how cool trampa 500 stays as its both mounted to frame and gets direct air as its waterproof designü§î
[2023-11-15T19:03:23] Jan: Scooter deck with controller in the deck
[2023-11-15T19:03:36] Mirono escooters: Very
[2023-11-15T19:03:37] Jan: But the floor is a rectangular tube with fins inside
[2023-11-15T19:04:11] Jan: <files/image (10).png>
[2023-11-15T19:04:34] Jan: At one point the airstream from driving just overpowers the fan
[2023-11-15T19:04:48] Happy Giraffe: Yup, takes space but would work. But then direct riding wind would be stronger. Also fans would block that air. Would need automated fans with servo motors that lay them down at 5kmhüòÇ
[2023-11-15T19:04:57] Jan: like this you would have always air flowing through the radiator
[2023-11-15T19:06:10] Happy Giraffe: Side profileüòÇ
[2023-11-15T19:06:53] Happy Giraffe: Open vent and when under 5kmh servo raises it down and blasts max fanspeed until accelerationüòÅ

[2023-11-15T21:17:28] Paolo ‚Å≠: The problem of this system is that the motor loss much torque
[2023-11-15T21:17:54] Mirono escooters: Still cool to show

[2023-11-15T21:25:29] Her0DasH #311 Johnny Player üá™üá∫: Well ,not much torque need in imagined usage ,but kinda good for nothing for now ,more like a show than rl solution

[2023-11-16T00:10:43] haku: i hope the frame atleast is american made.
[2023-11-16T00:11:24] NetworkDir: i don't think
[2023-11-16T00:11:54] NetworkDir: like maded by chinese children's

[2023-11-16T00:12:46] NetworkDir: mukuta 10-plus looks good
[2023-11-16T00:12:49] NetworkDir: but smol frame
[2023-11-16T00:14:07] haku: i agree. its a good looking scooter.
[2023-11-16T00:14:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Huameng is better for stability , material, bearing and their machine are better. LY better for power
[2023-11-16T00:14:39] NetworkDir: also why not segway GT2
[2023-11-16T00:15:03] NetworkDir: just 3000$
[2023-11-16T00:15:07] NetworkDir: best
[2023-11-16T00:15:20] NetworkDir: also in USA i think you can find empty frame
[2023-11-16T00:15:37] haku: there will be a new 72v segway i saw from here.

[2023-11-16T00:16:37] haku: its difficult to find used scooter frames here honestly.
[2023-11-16T00:16:54] NetworkDir: No i mean segway sells empty frames
[2023-11-16T00:16:59] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes but we keep at 11inch tyres ^^
[2023-11-16T00:17:27] haku: not for gt2 i believe

[2023-11-16T00:21:53] NetworkDir: sadly
[2023-11-16T00:23:57] NetworkDir: But maybe with contacting segway they sells frame
[2023-11-16T00:24:17] haku: trashed frames here almost sell for brand new.
[2023-11-16T00:24:44] Happy Giraffe: 700$ Australian is like 350-400$ USüòÅ

[2023-11-16T00:26:37] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes but is incomplete
[2023-11-16T00:29:00] haku: i wonder what would every part cost minus electronics
[2023-11-16T00:32:40] Paolo ‚Å≠: Flipsky on wolfüôà
[2023-11-16T00:46:00] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is heavy af and bad cooling
[2023-11-16T00:46:12] Paolo ‚Å≠: Is 2,2kg the box only
[2023-11-16T00:46:42] Paolo ‚Å≠: The scooter is already super heavy, i dont have elevator here
[2023-11-16T00:54:23] Happy Giraffe: Your house doenst have "bike-cellar" where you could lock it up to a radiator or some bike rack?

[2023-11-16T01:14:37] Ion: genuinely, what's even the point of these watt numbers on motors? Isn't batt amps*voltage the only relevant wattage?

[2023-11-16T01:33:52] JPPL: Seems easy nowadays
[2023-11-16T01:42:05] haku: i have no idea but i have to stop believing youtube and listen here instead
[2023-11-16T01:42:53] Ion: Well I mean yeah, but it's a huge motor, in dual they can do 15KW peak
[2023-11-16T01:54:44] cihan: Did anyone shop from 3d module store on AliExpress? They don't have a good rating but makerbase official store has 75200 v2 out of stock now.
[2023-11-16T02:11:00] cihan: And can someone recommend me bullet terminals? Motor wire and power wire on controller are 8AWG. But I have no idea about wires for motor and power on Navee n65. I'm almost sure they are thinner than 8AWG. Can this crimp thinner wire enough? Just found this amazing item on AliExpress. Check it out! US $1.24 8%OFF | 25/50/100sets 4.0 bullet Crimp terminal car electrical wire connector diameter 4mmFemale + Male + Case Cold press terminal https://a.aliexpress.com/_EQ2qt4p Or should I measure and get different size bullet terminals for cables on motor side and controller side? Will bullet terminals with different width crimp each other well? üôÑ
[2023-11-16T02:22:32] cihan: Thank you. Should I use xt150 for both motor and battery cable? Xt150 and bullet terminals are doing the same thing as I understand and can be used for both battery and power cables, yes? Is amass a generally quality brand? They have xt150 connectors too.
[2023-11-16T02:30:31] cihan: Sorry, bullet is an envelope name, I just got it.
[2023-11-16T02:31:54] cihan: Not much power but somehow I need to fit the cables inside the connectors. Do these xt150 only hold cable with solder inside it or do we also crimp it to hold tight?
[2023-11-16T02:33:38] cihan: So maybe 12awg cable of motor will still stick to xt150 connector strong enough?
[2023-11-16T02:35:02] cihan: Thank you, I'll name scooter S√∂derstr√∂m when it's finished.)
[2023-11-16T02:36:22] cihan: I won't use high current, probably never over 60 amps.
[2023-11-16T02:38:27] cihan: Xt150 has 6mm diameter inside. If that can hold 8AWG (3.8 mm diameter) tight, all good.
[2023-11-16T02:39:59] cihan: OK, I'm going with xt150, thanks a lot for your help.
[2023-11-16T03:05:17] haku: where to buy makerx g300? aliexpress or official site?
[2023-11-16T03:11:08] haku: and how is thier customer support?
[2023-11-16T03:41:31] cihan: I've seen some As150 antispark connectors. I don't need As150 for high current but I liked the antispark idea. Do they just have a constant resistance to prevent spark and will consume some power all the time when conducting? Does this resistance somehow drop after they start conducting? ü§î
[2023-11-16T03:44:00] haku: what is the reason why builders choose to spotweld the part of the nickel strip that has a slit in the middle? is there a reason for that?
[2023-11-16T03:44:42] haku: i like how this guy built this
[2023-11-16T03:50:19] cihan: Probably that slit creates a bulge on the surface. When the bulge faces battery and spot welded from the opposite side, it creates more contact area on cell surface.
[2023-11-16T03:51:25] haku: that makes sense. thanks
[2023-11-16T03:52:16] haku: this guy did not even solder the bms leads üëå
[2023-11-16T04:03:25] haku: no wonder every copper nickel build i see is mostly like this
[2023-11-16T04:03:59] haku: is this the ideal way or full strips over copper?
[2023-11-16T04:07:50] haku: ill be getting my new spot welder in a couple of days. i need to practice this on a dead cell
[2023-11-16T04:08:06] cihan: https://youtu.be/X71Suakve6A?si=1QZN5rCWmEkGb5IV
[2023-11-16T04:08:29] cihan: Antispark connector only works when plugging in
[2023-11-16T04:10:56] cihan: I couldn't understand. Why doesn't that slit conduct? Doesn't it touch cell surface?
[2023-11-16T04:17:22] haku: i really want to do this the proper way. hope this welder is capable
[2023-11-16T04:18:00] haku: i think this might be the best glitter has to offer.

[2023-11-16T06:30:55] Happy Giraffe: Or if vesc has default max input voltage of 72v? @jamessoderstrom
[2023-11-16T06:31:19] Happy Giraffe: I never used higher voltage so cant be sure how it behaves on first startup
[2023-11-16T06:31:48] Nick: It's probably at 84v but I'm assuming the vesc would account for that. It's a 200a
[2023-11-16T06:32:19] Happy Giraffe: Yeah it would be very stupid not to start
[2023-11-16T06:33:05] Happy Giraffe: Check battery voltage with multimeter

[2023-11-16T06:40:12] Happy Giraffe: And battery charged?
[2023-11-16T06:40:39] Nick: Should be yeah. I received it after it was built a couple weeks ago
[2023-11-16T06:40:44] Nick: Maybe built one month ago
[2023-11-16T06:40:53] Happy Giraffe: I remember you had the sketchy bomb battery where we had to guess how it worked lol
[2023-11-16T06:41:02] Happy Giraffe: Then needs to be turned on

[2023-11-16T07:36:43] Nick: Assuming the claim is good idk how that stuff works
[2023-11-16T07:37:46] Mirono escooters: "made in small batches to enhance performance and components" Just tell you are a small business and can't make much üôà
[2023-11-16T07:41:49] Mirono escooters: Those r shit
[2023-11-16T07:43:03] Mirono escooters: Their site
[2023-11-16T07:43:08] Mirono escooters: Pretty ok
[2023-11-16T07:44:30] Mirono escooters: Electricity always goes through the shortest path. And through cell is better, and better spotweld
[2023-11-16T07:48:50] Happy Giraffe: It was just a shit battery, if packed properly you can throw it around without damage. If you can, take money back and choose different guy.
[2023-11-16T07:49:24] Happy Giraffe: I would not like to live next to 10kg of TNT if built by unexperienced guy
[2023-11-16T07:49:39] Mirono escooters: Yee hahaha
[2023-11-16T08:24:23] cihan: If that slit touches tightly it should also conduct. But I didn't understand the purpose of the slit.
[2023-11-16T08:25:08] Mirono escooters: You dont understand..
[2023-11-16T08:25:53] Mirono escooters: If no slit, your power of the spotwelding goes over the nickel only, making not a good weld The slit forces current to run through the cell, wich makes for a way better spotweld.
[2023-11-16T08:31:52] cihan: Current also runs through cell surface too when spot welding, right?
[2023-11-16T08:37:18] cihan: Does as150 have an advantage over xt150 else than higher current capability? Do antispark version of as150 or xt150 (if any antispark version exists) have any disadvantage over the spark version?
[2023-11-16T08:40:46] cihan: I've missed that the antispark was about connectors on this one, sorry.
[2023-11-16T08:50:28] puneDir: do ignition mod
[2023-11-16T08:50:43] puneDir: easier its ok with good bms
[2023-11-16T10:02:30] Mirono escooters: That's the whole point
[2023-11-16T10:02:38] Mirono escooters: So it fuses
[2023-11-16T10:30:32] Konstantin: Gg
[2023-11-16T13:42:07] cihan: I'll buy antispark connectors for battery connection. Should I also buy antispark connectors for motor cables too? Is there any benefit? I guess I'll always disconnect battery first whenever I need to do something with motor cables.
[2023-11-16T13:43:02] cihan: By the way I'll buy Amass AS150, is there any reason to pick xt150 over it?
[2023-11-16T13:49:08] Jhinzuo ~~: There is no disadvantage over using Antispark on motor cables but aren't necessary, it's just to prevent the connectors from getting destroyed by the arc. My motor cables all have antispark xt90 cuz I had them laying around XD
[2023-11-16T13:50:19] Mirono escooters: No advantage
[2023-11-16T14:37:21] Happy Giraffe: Motor doesnt need and cant even have those
[2023-11-16T14:38:08] Happy Giraffe: XT150 push in, AS150 rotate in
[2023-11-16T14:38:47] Happy Giraffe: For my use xt150 easier to use and unplug if needed
[2023-11-16T16:13:48] Konstantin: Y, just a little modify pas.c and ap*.c ;)) If using 3 wire simple pass. Only w 1 signal
[2023-11-16T16:17:10] Mirono escooters: Ive never tried pas, could b interesting

[2023-11-16T18:14:02] Oreo huzky: Bruh I just bought a pwm generator
[2023-11-16T18:14:20] Mirono escooters: Real ones hardwire 12v to it 100% all the time
[2023-11-16T18:14:38] cihan: I'm going to buy honeycomb brackets for battery. Does 75200 work fine with 20s battery when regenerative brake is utilized? I just wanted to clarify once more since voltage will exceed 84V when braking. I found 1x10 and 1x13 brackets here. I'll buy 1x10 and stick 2 together to make 20. https://a.aliexpress.com/_EugALDj
[2023-11-16T18:18:07] cihan: The plastic thickness is 1.5mm. So it'll take 3cm extra length on a 20s. Should it be better not to use a bracket at all and just use hot melt glue? Hot melt glue holds really strong but people still prefer brackets so I'm confused.
[2023-11-16T18:45:32] haku: is that 12" tires?
[2023-11-16T18:53:44] haku: i will copy that style but my decals will say Laotie, zoom, aliexpress, bangood.

[2023-11-17T11:07:49] Mirono escooters: I need power..
[2023-11-17T11:36:33] JPPL: And balance ‚ù§Ô∏è
[2023-11-17T12:20:52] haku: is this a good price for this charger?
[2023-11-17T12:23:41] puneDir: is this wate clone?
[2023-11-17T12:24:36] haku: no idea. just looking for chargers. this price seems reasonable for 5a
[2023-11-17T12:25:26] puneDir: price is so cheap
[2023-11-17T12:25:34] haku: i agree.
[2023-11-17T12:26:13] puneDir: someone said in comments: randomly stopped working but seller give 70 percent refund
[2023-11-17T12:29:33] JPPL: Also good disconts
[2023-11-17T12:29:51] JPPL: Test it or never know it üòú
[2023-11-17T12:32:21] haku: yea i saw that.
[2023-11-17T12:33:27] haku: a good bms should be enough if charger messed up.
[2023-11-17T12:48:06] Santiago: Nevermind I was wrong I paid less srry
[2023-11-17T12:48:18] Santiago: I trust wate more anyway
[2023-11-17T12:48:59] haku: this is what im worried about. i dont want to cheap out on batteries and chargers. but if the bms is good. it should have no problems i think
[2023-11-17T12:49:59] haku: ali express always knows my heart.
[2023-11-17T12:51:41] Santiago: I've owned one of their chargers for over a year and no issues at all
[2023-11-17T12:56:25] Mirono escooters: Wate or yzpower
[2023-11-17T12:58:07] haku: same price
[2023-11-17T13:05:26] haku: or this one?
[2023-11-17T13:06:12] NetworkDir: This one good
[2023-11-17T13:06:43] NetworkDir: Good but little bit dangerous
[2023-11-17T13:07:20] NetworkDir: If the value has been changed by mistake Your bms and battery will probably be damaged
[2023-11-17T13:07:33] NetworkDir: <photos/photo_10989@17-11-2023_13-07-33.jpg>
[2023-11-17T13:07:45] haku: very risky
[2023-11-17T13:09:03] haku: the reason im considering that is if i go 21s
[2023-11-17T13:20:36] Jes√∫s: I bought this one and it‚Äôs good.
[2023-11-17T13:28:56] Mirono escooters: Adjustable cool
[2023-11-17T13:29:11] Mirono escooters: BMS protecc
[2023-11-17T13:29:14] Mirono escooters: Any good BMS protec
[2023-11-17T14:05:38] Gabe Enzo: Flipsky ain't bad huh
[2023-11-17T14:05:57] Gabe Enzo: Just need no skill issues in order to use it right
[2023-11-17T14:06:35] puneDir: 61v and its closed
[2023-11-17T14:08:11] Mirono escooters: For the price, not at all
[2023-11-17T14:08:24] Mirono escooters: The cUtoff issue is fixed by adding a cap to 12v line So simple, flipsky.
[2023-11-17T14:08:33] Mirono escooters: @Mltra in your opinion, how much uF?
[2023-11-17T14:09:11] puneDir: What?
[2023-11-17T14:09:15] puneDir: Really
[2023-11-17T14:09:29] NetworkDir: Also on off with resistor mod
[2023-11-17T14:09:35] Mirono escooters: Yes. I already told this above after talking to mxlemming And Konstantin confirmed
[2023-11-17T14:09:38] NetworkDir: just need to skills to fix issues
[2023-11-17T14:09:38] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-11-17T14:09:54] puneDir: WISH I COULDNT DIPPED IT IN RESIN
[2023-11-17T14:10:01] NetworkDir: HAHAHAHA
[2023-11-17T14:10:54] Mirono escooters: Was your stupidest idea
[2023-11-17T14:11:00] Mirono escooters: Well I mean, in non removable..
[2023-11-17T14:12:35] puneDir: Its ok i have enough battery
[2023-11-17T14:12:43] puneDir: Also now its waterproof
[2023-11-17T14:15:31] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2023-11-17T14:22:01] Gabe Enzo: You could've told me that before I spent 200‚Ç¨ on that box digga
[2023-11-17T14:22:08] Gabe Enzo: üíÄ
[2023-11-17T14:22:28] Gabe Enzo: You should pin that message Swear to god
[2023-11-17T14:22:42] Gabe Enzo: oh nvm, it is
[2023-11-17T14:24:04] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2023-11-17T14:26:06] Mirono escooters: Spintend still a tad better Or so they say
[2023-11-17T14:26:27] Mirono escooters: I never told u to spend that money hahahaha I am flipskys biggest fan i think in hereüòÇ
[2023-11-17T14:28:48] Gabe Enzo: I spent double to make sure I have a less chance of burning shit. and so far, it has worked, the settings I used for ages should've killed that ubox immediately
[2023-11-17T14:29:05] Gabe Enzo: I'm pretty sure flipsky wouldve given at 300a max abs
[2023-11-17T14:29:13] Gabe Enzo: then I would've just tied myself to the cieling fan
[2023-11-17T14:30:18] sombre_enfant: I would say like on xiaomi 47/33uf
[2023-11-17T14:31:20] Mirono escooters: That's very tiny But we are ofcourse talking about microseconds
[2023-11-17T14:31:36] Mirono escooters: I will see what Konstantin says Because I do not feel like offering mine up by trying lower values till ded hahahaha
[2023-11-17T14:31:43] Mirono escooters: No oscilloscope soü§∑
[2023-11-17T14:33:09] Mirono escooters: Skill issue, not flipsky
[2023-11-17T14:40:26] Gabe Enzo: It should be called SkillSky
[2023-11-17T14:46:11] Happy Giraffe: If you don't have smart bms active balancing you need CC-CV charger. Heck even those stop charging 13s at 54.1v instead of full 54.6. Don't know if that's bms or charger stopping charging thoüòÅ So non smart passive bms balance needs to fill battery very close to 100%. CC-CV is the only charger feature that does this
[2023-11-17T14:47:52] Mirono escooters: Most non retard chargers do cc cv
[2023-11-17T14:48:05] Mirono escooters: I've only seen 1 yet thats cc only hahaha
[2023-11-17T14:48:15] Gabe Enzo: what is a retard charger?,
[2023-11-17T14:49:23] Happy Giraffe: Tangzpower etc. Threw it in the trash already as I cant find it. Rattle noise and doesnt charge full
[2023-11-17T14:49:27] Mirono escooters: Punedirs hahaha
[2023-11-17T14:49:31] Mirono escooters: With 3 components hahahah
[2023-11-17T14:50:55] puneDir: <photos/photo_10990@17-11-2023_14-50-55.jpg>
[2023-11-17T14:51:00] puneDir: Here
[2023-11-17T15:06:56] Happy Giraffe: Are there passively cooled 13s chargers anywhere?ü§î
[2023-11-17T15:07:19] Happy Giraffe: I might buy grin satiator but 400‚Ç¨ for charger is nuts
[2023-11-17T15:27:00] puneDir: Anybody knows where can i find 84 volts
[2023-11-17T15:29:04] haku: ant bms would not charge 100% with these chargers? that one is passive balancing from what francis said
[2023-11-17T15:30:32] haku: sorry james i think
[2023-11-17T15:31:14] puneDir: is wate one of them?
[2023-11-17T15:34:00] Happy Giraffe: I only need like 1.5-2A
[2023-11-17T15:34:53] Happy Giraffe: Then you need CC-CV equipped charger, Constant Current Constant Voltage
[2023-11-17T15:35:10] Happy Giraffe: Pm pls pics etcüòÅ
[2023-11-17T15:37:42] puneDir: @Happy_Giraffe is wate cc cv
[2023-11-17T15:38:18] puneDir: its better for life
[2023-11-17T15:49:22] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2023-11-17T15:49:52] Gabe Enzo: Nice little pillow for bed
[2023-11-17T15:58:13] Oreo huzky: Looks comfy
[2023-11-17T15:58:43] Oreo huzky: With explosive alarm clock function to easily wake up in the morning
[2023-11-17T15:58:43] puneDir: Daily dose of charging g30
[2023-11-17T16:06:37] Mirono escooters: Colin furze bed that yeets you out
[2023-11-17T16:11:28] Oreo huzky: The only bed I can sleep in
[2023-11-17T18:34:58] Gabe Enzo: Uh oh guys
[2023-11-17T18:35:05] Gabe Enzo: the battery is at 45%
[2023-11-17T18:35:09] Gabe Enzo: it shouldn't have cut
[2023-11-17T18:35:22] Gabe Enzo: hope I didn't fucking burn the ubox, I didn't do anything to burn it
[2023-11-17T18:35:25] Gabe Enzo: @jamessoderstrom
[2023-11-17T18:37:39] Mirono escooters: How
[2023-11-17T18:37:53] Mirono escooters: Explain what happened instead of some vague messages
[2023-11-17T18:37:54] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-11-17T18:40:34] Gabe Enzo: Just suddenly cut after attempting 100a phase, or 80 I think.
[2023-11-17T18:40:40] Gabe Enzo: motor definitely not to blame because it happened immediately
[2023-11-17T18:41:10] Gabe Enzo: And batt was at half voltage
[2023-11-17T18:41:13] Gabe Enzo: motor cold
[2023-11-17T18:41:23] Gabe Enzo: I let the scooter sit for an hour before trying.
[2023-11-17T18:43:28] Gabe Enzo: UHhhh okay now it works?
[2023-11-17T18:43:30] Gabe Enzo: what the hell
[2023-11-17T18:43:35] Gabe Enzo: all I did was unplug and plug in lol
[2023-11-17T18:43:57] Gabe Enzo: maybe it was some metal dust because I modified the frame, got in somewhere and stopped the operation
[2023-11-17T18:44:00] Gabe Enzo: I'll clean it.
[2023-11-17T18:44:42] Gabe Enzo: tis unacceptable
[2023-11-17T18:47:42] Happy Giraffe: How about make one long message and tell about error messages if vesc stayed on or in the log?
[2023-11-17T18:48:20] Happy Giraffe: And how it cuts off? Motor overcurrent on start or?
[2023-11-17T18:49:16] Gabe Enzo: Im unsure, it cut by stopping acceleration before James helped me. So it's nothing to do with overcurrent here
[2023-11-17T18:49:23] Gabe Enzo: This happened after James helped me
[2023-11-17T18:49:34] Gabe Enzo: vesc turned off
[2023-11-17T18:49:41] Gabe Enzo: and wouldn't turn back on with key ignition
[2023-11-17T18:53:12] Gabe Enzo: @Mirono_escooters why is my esc showing my batt at 13% when it's at nominal? it's clearly set as 20s. Discharge cutoff is set to 55v.
[2023-11-17T18:54:56] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_10992@17-11-2023_18-54-56.jpg>
[2023-11-17T18:56:27] Mirono escooters: Is it reading v correctly
[2023-11-17T18:58:24] Gabe Enzo: I can't even find the option to read voltage. Is it because I am not using vesc BMS?
[2023-11-17T19:00:28] Mirono escooters: No
[2023-11-17T19:02:10] Gabe Enzo: Volts in 70
[2023-11-17T19:02:15] Gabe Enzo: it reads voltage correctly.
[2023-11-17T19:02:32] Gabe Enzo: voltmeter also shows 70.
[2023-11-17T19:03:03] Gabe Enzo: Why is this apparently necessary? and why hasn't Vedder fixed this issue?
[2023-11-17T19:04:42] Mirono escooters: Uh I have no issues
[2023-11-17T19:05:52] Happy Giraffe: <photos/photo_10994@17-11-2023_19-05-52.jpg>
[2023-11-17T19:09:24] Happy Giraffe: This when you did original setup
[2023-11-17T19:13:28] Gabe Enzo: No. But my internals were dirty. Mud and shit. Metal strings.
[2023-11-17T19:13:35] Gabe Enzo: I think the metal shards hit the BMS
[2023-11-17T19:13:39] Gabe Enzo: forced it to shut off
[2023-11-17T19:14:21] Gabe Enzo: GLAD it works
[2023-11-17T19:14:37] Gabe Enzo: so how do I fix the batt issue? I want it show true voltage. I have no Xiaomi dashboard to use rn
[2023-11-17T19:14:50] Gabe Enzo: I'm afraid if I upload the lisp my Mac will fuck the vesc settings you gave me
[2023-11-17T19:14:55] Gabe Enzo: I mean true percentage
[2023-11-17T19:15:12] Gabe Enzo: 70v cell can't be at 14% batt
[2023-11-17T19:15:19] Gabe Enzo: ye ikik
[2023-11-17T19:15:34] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_10995@17-11-2023_19-15-34.jpg>
[2023-11-17T19:15:51] Gabe Enzo: These cells are old.
[2023-11-17T19:15:55] Gabe Enzo: over 4 years
[2023-11-17T19:15:59] Gabe Enzo: but still pushing
[2023-11-17T19:16:20] Gabe Enzo: I know it depends on the cell spec sheet.
[2023-11-17T19:16:22] Mirono escooters: 129 range hahaha
[2023-11-17T19:16:31] Gabe Enzo: it's real. 300w vibes.
[2023-11-17T19:16:38] Mirono escooters: I doubt it a lot
[2023-11-17T19:16:43] Gabe Enzo: Smaller motor more efficient bro
[2023-11-17T19:16:48] Mirono escooters: Bro 129km
[2023-11-17T19:16:55] Mirono escooters: At 15% or whatev
[2023-11-17T19:16:59] Gabe Enzo: it's 70km. on full charge
[2023-11-17T19:17:05] Gabe Enzo: At 7a phase
[2023-11-17T19:17:12] Mirono escooters: 7a phase isn't even pushing a toddler
[2023-11-17T19:17:25] Gabe Enzo: Then scooter hacking utility is very very flawed.
[2023-11-17T19:17:33] Mirono escooters: Rofl
[2023-11-17T19:17:37] Gabe Enzo: I also reached 70+ with 25a phase
[2023-11-17T19:17:38] Gabe Enzo: apparently
[2023-11-17T19:17:43] Mirono escooters: Suure
[2023-11-17T19:17:43] Gabe Enzo: which now I know is BS
[2023-11-17T19:17:47] Gabe Enzo: I know
[2023-11-17T19:17:51] Mirono escooters: <sticker>
[2023-11-17T19:18:00] Gabe Enzo: Any idea why SHU was lying?
[2023-11-17T19:18:08] Gabe Enzo: Other than it being dog shit
[2023-11-17T19:19:00] Mirono escooters: Because it's a dog shit firmware with dog shit Esc No point in dis group
[2023-11-17T19:19:03] Gabe Enzo: I had shunts
[2023-11-17T19:19:05] Gabe Enzo: Looool
[2023-11-17T19:19:11] Gabe Enzo: Maxed out shunts
[2023-11-17T19:19:17] Gabe Enzo: Right
[2023-11-17T20:15:32] cihan: There's a switch which comes together with adc adapter v2. Does it also work as an anti spark switch?
[2023-11-17T20:16:06] cihan: I resisted a lot not to buy adc adapter v2 but I think I'll buy.
[2023-11-17T20:30:51] cihan: And what do you think about the spintend throttle? Does it make any sense to use it? https://spintend.com/products/two-way-throttle-spiny-for-diy-escooter-diy-ebike?variant=41889999814808
[2023-11-17T20:31:19] Mirono escooters: Good throttle
[2023-11-17T20:32:34] cihan: What do you think about twist throttle like the one motorbikes utilize? I think it can be even better but not sure. I didn't want to spend a lot but I'm just bored of searching and searching so I better buy now with 11.11 discount and end my searching.
[2023-11-17T20:33:07] cihan: does it have a spring and return to neutral when released like most throttles?
[2023-11-17T20:33:52] Mirono escooters: Yes
[2023-11-17T20:34:54] haku: i like mine.
[2023-11-17T20:35:10] Gabe Enzo: Xiaomi throttle ftw
[2023-11-17T20:36:26] Happy Giraffe: Twist throttle can be annoying on scooter as you cant sit when riding bumps etc it all eventually makes control throttle harder
[2023-11-17T20:36:32] cihan: It has also an option with button, does this button also work as an anti spark switch? I realized that things will be hard without a button and to leave the scooter always on. So I want a button, while getting a switch it should be better anti spark. If I can get all together with better throttle with spintend throttle, it's best of both worlds for me.
[2023-11-17T20:36:42] Happy Giraffe: Thumb throttle you can rest hand on handlebar
[2023-11-17T20:40:06] cihan: You're right, twist throttle is better when you sit and don't need to apply force on the handlebar.
[2023-11-17T20:44:37] cihan: I read this as a warning but couldn't really understand what they mean with VESC throttle. Reminds: If you're using our ewheel adc adapter v2 to wire SPIN-Y2, then you should NOT use VESC Throttle, but to use a Normal Throttle.
[2023-11-17T20:48:27] cihan: I also think about using one of the buttons there as a light button. I'll take the battery of external headlight out and feed 5V or 12V to this external headlight from battery. Can I have enough current for 5V or 12V when using ehweel adapter v2?
[2023-11-17T20:49:15] cihan: These throttle and wheel adapter now costs more than the VESC controller. I was planning to make navee n65 a little faster when I first noticed VESC. üòÅ
[2023-11-17T20:50:19] cihan: But as long as they don't break easily I'm fine with costs, I think I'll be using VESC for all scooters I'll have in future, maybe with adding another motor and controller.
[2023-11-17T20:52:34] cihan: I found the answer in manual.
[2023-11-17T20:56:53] cihan: Ftw? Could you rephrase please?
[2023-11-17T21:06:57] cihan: Was this because of own fault or something related with throttle quality? I started to search past about spintend throttle.
[2023-11-17T21:09:44] cihan: I also would like to ask if using adc v2 adapter with makerbase 75200 v2 would cause any problem since I won't be using a spintend controller. And I also wonder if adc v2 can be utilized as an anti spark switch.
[2023-11-17T21:15:20] JPPL: No problem
[2023-11-17T21:15:55] JPPL: All vesc works
[2023-11-17T21:16:30] JPPL: No antispark switch
[2023-11-17T21:17:55] JPPL: ONLY 5v power goes in, or + 12v for lights etc, no Turn on switch either, website says its all
[2023-11-17T21:21:05] Gabe Enzo: for the win
[2023-11-17T21:23:33] Mirono escooters: Button wired to smart BMS yes Otherwise no..
[2023-11-17T21:25:50] haku: yes. i think i might messed it up or not. i dont really know. but the inventor of the throttle offered to fix and replace it for free. i just did not want to waste his time for $60.00
[2023-11-17T21:28:52] haku: the guy was really cool. he wanted to fix it and replace it. i just did not want to waste his engineering hours for that.
[2023-11-17T21:35:14] haku: i really like the feel of this throttle. it also has a cruise control feature wich is convinient
[2023-11-17T21:36:34] haku: this was the broken one
[2023-11-17T21:39:49] JPPL: Mine are older versions üò≠
[2023-11-17T21:43:34] haku: i wish spintend would have replaced it not the maker of it.
[2023-11-17T21:47:27] Jes√∫s: What a copy of Rion‚Äôs accelerator üò¨
[2023-11-17T21:48:32] Jes√∫s: But it‚Äôs beautiful
[2023-11-17T21:49:37] haku: i like it. i dont really scoot agressively. this is perfect for walking pace and going top speed
[2023-11-17T21:50:47] Jes√∫s: Correct, Rion‚Äôs is amazing, the technology it has is the best I‚Äôve tried
[2023-11-17T21:52:01] Mirono escooters: What
[2023-11-17T21:52:13] Mirono escooters: Lol, its better
[2023-11-17T21:52:24] Mirono escooters: Rion scam price, shit design, shit brand
[2023-11-17T21:52:29] puneDir: is there any pics of cutoff proof 75100
[2023-11-17T21:52:38] puneDir: where to connect caps
[2023-11-17T21:52:39] Mirono escooters: Just add a cap on 12v line lmao
[2023-11-17T21:52:50] puneDir: What about drivers
[2023-11-17T21:52:59] Mirono escooters: Drivers are powered with 12v smartie
[2023-11-17T21:53:21] puneDir: Ok gonna add 2000 caps to there
[2023-11-17T21:53:41] Mirono escooters: Oh god
[2023-11-17T21:54:47] Jes√∫s: If you haven‚Äôt had any Rion in your whore, much less the accelerator üòÇ don‚Äôt fuck with it, man.
[2023-11-17T21:55:21] puneDir: my g30 is faster than your rion
[2023-11-17T21:55:45] Jes√∫s: You live very far away.
[2023-11-17T21:55:52] puneDir: eh lol
[2023-11-17T21:55:54] Mirono escooters: In my what?
[2023-11-17T21:55:58] puneDir: i dont like rion too
[2023-11-17T21:56:02] Gabe Enzo: Whore
[2023-11-17T21:56:29] haku: spanish for puta
[2023-11-17T21:56:29] puneDir: Design is weird
[2023-11-17T21:56:41] Jes√∫s: He‚Äôs respectable
[2023-11-17T21:57:26] Jes√∫s: How do you like colors?
[2023-11-17T21:57:37] puneDir: what
[2023-11-17T21:57:44] Mirono escooters: I do not understand your sentence, nor why you say bad words to me.
[2023-11-17T21:58:04] Jes√∫s: That there are tastes like colors.
[2023-11-17T21:58:49] Mirono escooters: And do I not know a meaning to that word, except the obvious?
[2023-11-17T21:58:54] Jes√∫s: I didn‚Äôt tell you anything bad, I just told you the truth.
[2023-11-17T21:59:05] Mirono escooters: That I'm a whore? Or what is that sentence?
[2023-11-17T21:59:45] Jes√∫s: No, man, that‚Äôs not what I wanted to say
[2023-11-17T22:00:01] Mirono escooters: Ok, translation error The sentence is weird
[2023-11-17T22:00:03] Jes√∫s: Excuse me for my English
[2023-11-17T22:00:14] Mirono escooters: No issue üëç
[2023-11-17T22:00:26] sombre_enfant: Fellow french rider
[2023-11-17T22:00:26] Jes√∫s: I didn‚Äôt mean that.
[2023-11-17T22:00:57] sombre_enfant: <animation>
[2023-11-17T22:01:06] Mirono escooters: No problemo
[2023-11-17T22:01:09] Mirono escooters: That's why I ask ;)
[2023-11-18T00:20:14] haku: https://youtube.com/shorts/DfuyG0Ibk9g?si=w1Xwo0AqNWI9Y_gD
[2023-11-18T00:20:15] haku: this is how modern motors made?
[2023-11-18T00:23:03] haku: why are the windings so thick?
[2023-11-18T00:26:22] Jan: High KV motor
[2023-11-18T00:26:40] Jan: Less resistance but for the same torque you need more amps
[2023-11-18T00:26:54] Jan: gets more efficient at high speeds, but no low-end power
[2023-11-18T00:27:33] haku: i see. more thinner windings more torque?
[2023-11-18T00:28:20] Jan: Yes that would be a low kv motor
[2023-11-18T00:28:28] Jan: but topspeed is gone
[2023-11-18T00:28:37] haku: got it. thanks.
[2023-11-18T01:33:15] cihan: Does anyone use the antispark switch with voltage over 60V since it's rated 60V only.
[2023-11-18T11:46:12] Mirono escooters: Why would you go over rated voltage üíÄüíÄ
[2023-11-18T12:07:21] Yamal: Morning ‚ö°Ô∏è
[2023-11-18T12:09:44] JPPL: Tronic insideee
[2023-11-18T12:13:16] Yamal: Yes,under process , waiting for the batery ‚Ä¶ 20s10p Samsung 40t,and motors,, all is just expensive üòÖüòÇ
[2023-11-18T12:56:49] Mirono escooters: Rich hahaha
[2023-11-18T13:00:43] haku: for a 20s9p pack whith copper nickel. what is the proper guage wire for qs8? 6awg or 8awg?
[2023-11-18T13:01:45] haku: it will be 350a peak.
[2023-11-18T13:04:09] Gabe Enzo: how much constant?
[2023-11-18T13:04:51] Gabe Enzo: When in doubt use the next biggest size.
[2023-11-18T13:05:05] haku: around 160 per side the most.
[2023-11-18T13:05:26] Gabe Enzo: that's like 80a per wire minimum. I'd say use 6awg defo
[2023-11-18T13:05:43] haku: gotcha. thanks.
[2023-11-18T13:05:44] Gabe Enzo: Right?
[2023-11-18T13:05:47] Gabe Enzo: ye
[2023-11-18T13:06:13] Gabe Enzo: For RC we always used 10awg for 100a but our wires are so so short so it's ok
[2023-11-18T13:06:28] haku: that was what thinking too just want to confirm with the sages
[2023-11-18T13:06:28] Face de Pin Suc√©: If only one connector, then 6AWG yes
[2023-11-18T13:06:32] sombre_enfant: 6awg is big af in a scooter
[2023-11-18T13:06:34] Face de Pin Suc√©: If 2 connectors 8AWG is enough
[2023-11-18T13:06:39] Gabe Enzo: Qs means bike
[2023-11-18T13:07:18] sombre_enfant: Its a connector man
[2023-11-18T13:07:28] Face de Pin Suc√©: Hahaha
[2023-11-18T13:07:31] Face de Pin Suc√©: Amazing
[2023-11-18T13:08:37] Gabe Enzo: then my answer is wrong I thought it was phase current
[2023-11-18T13:08:47] Gabe Enzo: @Bradhaku don't listen to me
[2023-11-18T13:10:21] haku: thanks guys! when im in doubt i always double check here.
[2023-11-18T13:31:15] Mirono escooters: What??
[2023-11-18T13:31:37] Mirono escooters: "100a" very peak, very fake

[2023-11-18T13:34:44] Gabe Enzo: Haha, u do know that 1/5 scale RCS use the same kind of motor as the surron bee.
[2023-11-18T13:34:56] Gabe Enzo: compared to that they're weak
[2023-11-18T13:35:12] Mirono escooters: A 1/5 scale isn't pulling same power as a scoot üôÇ
[2023-11-18T13:35:35] Mirono escooters: The blue helps a lot
[2023-11-18T13:35:49] puneDir: Still shit but better
[2023-11-18T13:36:06] Gabe Enzo: It pulls more.
[2023-11-18T13:36:19] Mirono escooters: Lol
[2023-11-18T13:36:23] Mirono escooters: Sure
[2023-11-18T13:36:43] Happy Giraffe: You haven't heard of "load" of the motor
[2023-11-18T13:40:05] Gabe Enzo: this can most definitely power a Surron better than the stock motor.
[2023-11-18T13:40:13] Gabe Enzo: it's literally 500kv
[2023-11-18T13:40:44] Gabe Enzo: It can run 24s at 500a. 1000a peak.
[2023-11-18T13:40:47] Gabe Enzo: Lmao
[2023-11-18T13:45:04] Gabe Enzo: Because he said QS I assumed he was talking about phase wires and their required gauge size.
[2023-11-18T13:46:56] Mirono escooters: What
[2023-11-18T13:47:12] Mirono escooters: And this tells literally nothing
[2023-11-18T13:47:42] Mirono escooters: Suure
[2023-11-18T13:47:52] haku: very nice bro! i like the blue accents.
[2023-11-18T13:51:53] Gabe Enzo: With less load or more load, the wattage going through the motor is real?
[2023-11-18T13:52:05] Gabe Enzo: There is indeed 40kw going through that green can.
[2023-11-18T13:54:07] Gabe Enzo: So in essence, it "pulls" more power than a scooter with molicel. Now that doesn't mean that it uses it the same way
[2023-11-18T13:54:12] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: For 500A DC continious it must have a cross section of at least 50mm¬≤ minimum
[2023-11-18T13:54:20] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Like, lol, no
[2023-11-18T13:54:50] –ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª: Thats 0AWG
[2023-11-18T13:57:21] Mirono escooters: Physics are disagreeing with you, electron
[2023-11-18T13:57:38] Gabe Enzo: The shorter the wire is the more you can get away with? no?
[2023-11-18T13:57:44] Mirono escooters: Wtf
[2023-11-18T13:57:54] Mirono escooters: Those wires ain't short br√∂der
[2023-11-18T13:58:22] Gabe Enzo: Yeah, I'm failing physics in uni.
[2023-11-18T13:58:26] Gabe Enzo: Nice catch
[2023-11-18T14:03:09] Mirono escooters: XD
[2023-11-18T14:03:24] Gabe Enzo: no like I'm actually fucked I don't think I'll pass this year
[2023-11-18T14:03:30] Gabe Enzo: I'm genuinely paranoid
[2023-11-18T14:03:34] Mirono escooters: It just started üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
[2023-11-18T14:03:38] Gabe Enzo: exams are at Christmas.
[2023-11-18T14:03:46] Gabe Enzo: we are 10 weeks in
[2023-11-18T14:03:51] Gabe Enzo: 14 weeks in a year
[2023-11-18T14:03:52] Gabe Enzo: here
[2023-11-18T14:04:04] Gabe Enzo: And im fucked cause I got transferred late
[2023-11-18T14:04:07] puneDir: i just found a way to feel like electrocuted without touching any electric
[2023-11-18T14:04:27] Gabe Enzo: Get spiked by a wire.
[2023-11-18T14:04:37] Gabe Enzo: When twisting it
[2023-11-18T14:04:46] puneDir: No
[2023-11-18T14:04:50] Gabe Enzo: then how.
[2023-11-18T14:09:40] Mirono escooters: I'm gonna end the useless unrelated spam here.
[2023-11-18T14:23:29] Happy Giraffe: Electron still needs to learn to type more words per message. Nobody wants to read 100+ messages instead of 20. You can edit them to add more info without spam
[2023-11-18T14:28:45] Mirono escooters: Yes. Just put em into 1, not 8 for something stupid. I understand ADHD or alike isn't handy, but, try.
[2023-11-18T16:25:36] Face de Pin Suc√©: hahaha wtf
[2023-11-18T17:00:17] Happy Giraffe: Clearly he fails physics. The motor torque of this will be so little due to the size of magnets and diameter alone.
[2023-11-18T17:02:08] Face de Pin Suc√©: He fails many things
[2023-11-18T17:05:27] Mirono escooters: üôà
[2023-11-18T17:06:45] Gabe Enzo: What's the size of the surron motor? I've never seen one.
[2023-11-18T17:07:41] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: Very small for a bike motor
[2023-11-18T17:09:50] Paolo ‚Å≠: 35 x 165 if im not wrong
[2023-11-18T17:11:25] Gabe Enzo: Then how can it handle 4kw?
[2023-11-18T17:12:04] üÜÅapha√´l üÖµouüÖπiwara: he can handle ~15kw at least and not long
[2023-11-18T17:14:32] Mirono escooters: Inrunner, and well build
[2023-11-18T17:16:03] Gabe Enzo: I sincerely doubt that any non castle motor is well built üòÜ what brand is it. Btw I stood down on the castle motor being able to handle 500a constant so you won that argument.
[2023-11-18T17:16:26] Gabe Enzo: So you won that fight, I'm just comparing the two now.
[2023-11-18T17:16:48] Mirono escooters: So anything except castle is not good?
[2023-11-18T17:17:06] Mirono escooters: You know you can not compare a 1/5 rc motor with a surron motor, riight?
[2023-11-18T17:17:49] Mirono escooters: Ko moto makes a upgraded motor for the surron, Problably others too But not castle hahaha
[2023-11-18T17:18:25] Gabe Enzo: for canned brushless motors yes. Also sure they are like made for RC, but they are literally just canned motors. The RC is just an application it can be used for, like VESC also being able to be ran on RC.
[2023-11-18T17:18:39] Gabe Enzo: Or a drone.
[2023-11-18T17:18:48] Mirono escooters: Yes, obviously You can put em on longboards or whatever
[2023-11-18T17:18:57] Mirono escooters: Not always inrunners
[2023-11-18T17:19:30] Mirono escooters: I'd love to see vesc on Rc cars, just to Final have real values Because internet is flooded with "180/380A Esc" üòÇ
[2023-11-18T17:34:29] Face de Pin Suc√©: How can you speak about something then say you never saw it ?
[2023-11-18T17:35:52] Mirono escooters: My thoughts
[2023-11-18T17:41:54] Oreo huzky: üíÄ
[2023-11-18T17:43:54] Gabe Enzo: Because it can only handle 4kw clearly. I've heard you all talk about it multiple times so obviously I can create a basis on it
[2023-11-18T17:44:50] Gabe Enzo: Yeah and only castle escs can be programmed. If they made their hardware compatible with vesc that would be very beneficial.
[2023-11-18T17:45:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: Its real current
[2023-11-18T17:45:44] Paolo ‚Å≠: But they runs at low voltage
[2023-11-18T17:45:55] Face de Pin Suc√©: Yes 3-4-6S
[2023-11-18T17:46:16] Gabe Enzo: Yes, you only have to worry about the motor. the ESC dishes out whatever it's made for. Also it will kill batteries if they aren't the right specs. that's why there's so many blow up videos when morons destroy shit.
[2023-11-18T17:46:44] Gabe Enzo: Meh, 8s to 16s is kinda the thing, or was. 6s is for like 1/10 scale. which is the norm.
[2023-11-18T17:55:31] Gabe Enzo: Ok enough non vesc related electron spam.
[2023-11-18T18:26:25] Mirono escooters: He's learning
[2023-11-18T18:26:54] Mirono escooters: Very much doubt
[2023-11-18T18:35:48] Paolo ‚Å≠: Why?
[2023-11-18T18:36:32] Mirono escooters: I know they run at low voltage But those tiny 180A rated escs ain't doing that
[2023-11-18T18:36:40] Mirono escooters: Maybe the 1/5 scale big ones with fan, maybe
[2023-11-18T18:36:46] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes they do
[2023-11-18T18:36:46] Mirono escooters: And still very peak and tire spin
[2023-11-18T18:36:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: Low boltage mosfet are very powwrful
[2023-11-18T18:37:07] Paolo ‚Å≠: 30v fet are like 0.6mR
[2023-11-18T18:37:17] Mirono escooters: Poor motors
[2023-11-18T18:37:34] Paolo ‚Å≠: Motors also are winded for very high kv
[2023-11-18T18:37:45] Mirono escooters: Yes crazy high kv
[2023-11-18T18:37:53] Mirono escooters: Fair point there, takes a lot of amps
[2023-11-18T18:37:54] Paolo ‚Å≠: U can also made escooter motor support 1000A, but 0 torque xd
[2023-11-18T18:38:02] Paolo ‚Å≠: Yes
[2023-11-18T18:41:43] sombre_enfant: Unpopular opinion Hobbywing better than castle
[2023-11-18T18:50:17] haku: sorry what is that a store?
[2023-11-18T18:55:43] Gabe Enzo: castle is a luxury brand like molicel.
[2023-11-18T18:56:10] haku: i see
[2023-11-18T18:56:25] haku: molicel isnt luxurt
[2023-11-18T18:56:38] Gabe Enzo: Lmao what is there that is more expensive
[2023-11-18T18:56:58] haku: luxury its more bang for buck in my eyes compared to established brands
[2023-11-18T18:57:49] Gabe Enzo: bang for your buck for KW output
[2023-11-18T18:57:51] Gabe Enzo: that's it.
[2023-11-18T18:57:58] Gabe Enzo: Lol
[2023-11-18T18:58:22] haku: lg/sony/samsung have more expensive cells than molicel that has comparable specs lol
[2023-11-18T18:59:05] haku: for me personally. molicel is bang for buck
[2023-11-18T19:00:05] Gabe Enzo: Correcto
[2023-11-18T19:00:16] Gabe Enzo: So powerful it seems fake.
[2023-11-18T19:00:27] haku: they are just not used in the pev industry for unkown reason
[2023-11-18T19:00:59] Gabe Enzo: I had a bunch of molicel p42a before from Dyson vaccum cleaners.
[2023-11-18T19:01:21] Happy Giraffe: Molicel P45B best high power cell ever periodüòÇ
[2023-11-18T19:01:33] Gabe Enzo: They always failed after a year, I'm unsure why but one out of 6 cells would always fail..
[2023-11-18T19:01:41] Gabe Enzo: We've switched out our Dyson cells so many times.
[2023-11-18T19:02:18] haku: there is a sale right now $6.00 per cell. im really thinking hard on it
[2023-11-18T19:03:32] haku: i really want p42 to go on sale. but im doubting it now
[2023-11-18T19:03:48] Gabe Enzo: I've been looking for ages and they just aren't budging.
[2023-11-18T19:03:53] Gabe Enzo: I need 100 of them..
[2023-11-18T19:03:55] Happy Giraffe: Only use that if you need 35-40A per cell or continuous 25A+ as its a premium priced cell. If 50S or P42A found cheaper it might be better value
[2023-11-18T19:08:27] Gabe Enzo: 5 Min runtime btw
[2023-11-18T19:08:31] Gabe Enzo: üíÄ
[2023-11-18T19:09:12] haku: my dyson lasted 8 years. only 1 battery change. its on its last legs though
[2023-11-18T19:10:06] Gabe Enzo: U can find free molicels, just go to a mall with a recycling center. There will be Dyson cells everywhere in those battery boxes.
[2023-11-18T19:10:21] Gabe Enzo: 5 out of 6 of them are pristine condition, its always one cell that fails
[2023-11-18T19:10:33] Gabe Enzo: üòÇ
[2023-11-18T19:11:23] haku: so sad in the US batteries go straight to the bin. there is no battery recycling centers.
[2023-11-18T19:12:38] Gabe Enzo: I threw away 100 lithium ion cells into the trash yesterday.
[2023-11-18T19:12:44] Gabe Enzo: I just realized that's illegal
[2023-11-18T19:12:49] haku: lol
[2023-11-18T19:12:50] Gabe Enzo: in EU
[2023-11-18T19:12:52] Gabe Enzo: Yep
[2023-11-18T19:12:57] Paolo ‚Å≠: Because pev normally need more range , not power
[2023-11-18T19:13:08] Paolo ‚Å≠: 7P of lg or samsung is pretty enougj
[2023-11-18T19:13:51] haku: but all these new super scooters need the amps. they are putting long range cells still.
[2023-11-18T19:14:41] Jhinzuo ~~: We have to bring em away to malls there are some boxes to collect
[2023-11-18T19:15:21] Paolo ‚Å≠: Nami is 8p for 100A, is more than enougu
[2023-11-18T19:15:34] haku: nami for example use m50lt
[2023-11-18T19:15:49] Paolo ‚Å≠: 7Ah of capacity is much
[2023-11-18T19:15:52] Jhinzuo ~~: When u use high amp low range cells u can Just use high ampere quick charger with type2 ev plugüëÄ everywhere basically.
[2023-11-18T19:15:58] Paolo ‚Å≠: And me too wouldnt choose molicel for it
[2023-11-18T19:15:58] haku: comparable
[2023-11-18T19:17:28] haku: lol im sure.
[2023-11-18T19:17:29] Gabe Enzo: How fast is the nami?
[2023-11-18T19:18:06] Gabe Enzo: Meh a bit faster than mine then. Fast for me I guess.
[2023-11-18T19:18:17] Gabe Enzo: Ill go faster when I get my 1kw motor heh
[2023-11-18T19:26:20] haku: i was thinking. would bolting 2 vescs on 1 heatsink okay? or that is a bad idea?
[2023-11-18T19:27:32] Gabe Enzo: sure? where are you planning to put this tho
[2023-11-18T19:28:06] haku: on on the front. like a radiator
[2023-11-18T19:28:13] Gabe Enzo: Yeah üëç
[2023-11-18T19:44:50] Konstantin: And usually 1st cell, coz drain for logic ;)))
[2023-11-18T19:49:18] üé∏ POSS üèÅ (Crimekillz): now i know why i didn't simply 3D print it and went with the monorim solution :D (material thickness) good job tho
[2023-11-18T19:49:45] puneDir: will it be so weak?
[2023-11-18T19:49:48] puneDir: Tbh looks good
[2023-11-18T19:51:19] üé∏ POSS üèÅ (Crimekillz): nah, i don't think it will be weak but it certainly is a statement
[2023-11-18T19:51:37] puneDir: it looks like üëÖ
[2023-11-18T19:55:01] üé∏ POSS üèÅ (Crimekillz): love the blue bumpers and decals
[2023-11-18T19:56:39] puneDir: I added blue extender too (cuz i cant get rid of rails
[2023-11-18T20:17:11] üé∏ POSS üèÅ (Crimekillz): Do you or anyone have an idea how i could install a front motor with disk brake without using a monorim suspension? You seem to have put a lot of thought into it so maybe you know something Maybe sharkset can be adapted or i dunno, G2 suspension with modifications on G30 frame. I just dislike how the Monorim suspension protrudes
[2023-11-18T20:19:15] sombre_enfant: U can put a pro2 front motor on the fork
[2023-11-18T21:07:43] Jhinzuo ~~: Where can I put it? Anywhere on the 12v line close to drivers üëÄ I'll put 47uf like on Xiaomi
[2023-11-18T21:12:34] üé∏ POSS üèÅ (Crimekillz): isn't the Pro2 motor 8.5" and the G30 motor 10"?

[2023-11-18T21:29:58] Gabe Enzo: Pro 2 Motor 6.1"
[2023-11-18T21:31:13] haku: nice! where is the other one?
[2023-11-18T21:31:34] Gabe Enzo: The other what hahaha
[2023-11-18T21:31:51] puneDir: Please fix the wiring
[2023-11-18T21:31:56] haku: the other vesc. isnt it dual motor?
[2023-11-18T21:32:04] puneDir: It looks like a mess
[2023-11-18T21:32:14] Gabe Enzo: That was the plan before my second 300w blew.
[2023-11-18T21:32:24] puneDir: <photos/photo_11008@18-11-2023_21-32-24.jpg>

[2023-11-18T21:32:32] Gabe Enzo: When i get molicel.
[2023-11-18T21:32:34] puneDir: I managed cables like this
[2023-11-18T21:32:50] Gabe Enzo: I'll just use a zip tie for them.
[2023-11-18T21:33:04] haku: of my bad i thought it was punedirs. same color
[2023-11-18T21:33:05] Gabe Enzo: Worry more about the quality of solder than the look of it
[2023-11-18T21:33:16] puneDir: fix that too
[2023-11-18T21:33:19] Gabe Enzo: I'm 3d printing @nosoudoppi a rainbow Spacer.
[2023-11-18T21:33:25] Gabe Enzo: <photos/photo_11009@18-11-2023_21-33-25.jpg>

[2023-11-18T21:34:29] haku: thats a nice setup with the spacer.
[2023-11-18T21:34:31] Gabe Enzo: <video_file>
[2023-11-18T21:34:42] puneDir: I cant find that lol maybe i will 3dp
[2023-11-18T21:35:06] Gabe Enzo: Just use paper glue and find some nice colour to cut.
[2023-11-18T21:35:08] Gabe Enzo: Ez.
[2023-11-18T21:36:12] puneDir: @Mirono_escooters hey bro Do you still have the model for here?
[2023-11-18T21:37:05] haku: i really want to build my g30. after im finished with laotie i will put the parts in there
[2023-11-18T21:37:28] haku: i never see this kinda modding in the US
[2023-11-18T21:38:44] haku: 72v will only fit with a spacer on these right?
[2023-11-18T21:39:41] puneDir: No
[2023-11-18T21:39:48] puneDir: it can fit 140 cells in
[2023-11-18T21:41:33] haku: how many 21700 can fit?
[2023-11-18T21:41:41] puneDir: I printed 6mm extender cuz i couldnt cut rails
[2023-11-18T21:41:53] puneDir: Also it adds a good tiny blue detail
[2023-11-18T21:42:04] puneDir: I have no idea about that But G30 is pretty big inside
[2023-11-18T21:42:51] NetworkDir: G30 i think 60x 21700 Snsc 2.3 80x 21700 i think
[2023-11-18T21:42:54] haku: there are rails for the stock battery inside. do you grind that down?
[2023-11-18T21:43:17] puneDir: Nah i didnt
[2023-11-18T21:43:46] haku: and you fit batteries vertically without spacer?
[2023-11-18T21:44:11] puneDir: Because i dont want to fuck off my frame Cengiz just added some isolation on bottom it (2x thick transperant nylon thingy) So its flat on bottom
[2023-11-18T21:44:26] haku: i see
[2023-11-18T21:44:53] puneDir: Yes Also it got holders I printed the spacer to add some blue touch üòÇ Actually its not that needed The plastic cover bends enough
[2023-11-18T21:47:03] Gabe Enzo: Pro 2 can have 60 cells with a medium extender bro
[2023-11-18T21:47:40] Gabe Enzo: G30 can have way more
[2023-11-18T21:48:00] Gabe Enzo: I got 20s9p total on my G30 , 6p inside 3p outside.
[2023-11-18T21:48:07] Gabe Enzo: Yes
[2023-11-18T21:48:19] haku: this is what i want to try. ill have a spare motor. and ask someone to cnc dropouts for me.
[2023-11-18T21:48:46] puneDir: i have 20s 4p in and 20s4p out Theres a lot of free space inside with 20s4p and 2 escs
[2023-11-18T21:49:22] haku: or stretch the dropouts
[2023-11-18T21:50:02] Gabe Enzo: 21700?
[2023-11-18T21:50:04] Gabe Enzo: Right?
[2023-11-18T21:50:09] Gabe Enzo: What spacer size do you have
[2023-11-18T21:50:16] Gabe Enzo: Can I see your bag?
[2023-11-18T21:50:18] Gabe Enzo: for your pro 2.

[2023-11-18T22:15:43] Mirono escooters: Ok
[2023-11-18T22:15:48] Mirono escooters: Hard
[2023-11-18T22:16:04] Mirono escooters: I gave mine away xD Sometime ago no one wanted it
[2023-11-18T22:17:06] Jhinzuo ~~: Oh mannnnnn üòû
[2023-11-18T22:17:19] Jhinzuo ~~: been looking for months almost gave up
[2023-11-18T22:18:15] Mirono escooters: Harder now, most rentals use newer
[2023-11-18T22:18:29] Jhinzuo ~~: ye here in Germany they stopped using ninebots
[2023-11-18T22:18:33] Jhinzuo ~~: they use okai
[2023-11-18T22:33:31] üé∏ POSS üèÅ (Crimekillz): D√ºsseldorf still has Ninebots
[2023-11-18T22:35:07] üé∏ POSS üèÅ (Crimekillz): Also saw them in Karlsruhe but that was in March

[2023-11-18T23:17:46] haku: i would like that but too expensive for my 1st printer.
[2023-11-18T23:17:52] Jhinzuo ~~: In my area Lime bolt and tier
[2023-11-18T23:19:00] puneDir: wheelie machine

[2023-11-18T23:35:35] Jhinzuo ~~: We got these here as well
[2023-11-18T23:36:07] Jhinzuo ~~: Hitting up tier if they sell broken ones won't rlly work without taking 100 at least right
[2023-11-18T23:41:34] puneDir: monday imma gonna get the alupcb üòÅ

[2023-11-19T00:02:28] Gabe Enzo: Cheat code.
[2023-11-19T00:11:25] Gabe Enzo: hot countrytards stay coping
[2023-11-19T00:15:59] cihan: I think it's something expensive for what it is unless it satisfies high voltage need on the long term. In fact I never thought about upgrading battery but I've already exceeded my start budget for vesc quiet a lot now. So from now on I'm sure I'll build 19-20s battery in the future and I still want to use that anti spark switch if I get one. But 60V is a no for me if it seriously doesn't allow more and I guess this specification is true since they wouldn't want to limit themselves. I didn't buy it and won't buy unless it's 84V.
[2023-11-19T00:17:28] puneDir: Some metal dust caused it
[2023-11-19T00:18:57] cihan: A short?
[2023-11-19T00:19:08] puneDir: No nothing
[2023-11-19T00:19:21] puneDir: Just little bit squished shrink
[2023-11-19T00:19:31] cihan: I thought the same too.
[2023-11-19T00:19:35] Mirono escooters: Ofc not
[2023-11-19T00:19:39] puneDir: cengiz maded that battery üòÉ nothing will happen to it
[2023-11-19T00:22:47] cihan: Somehow I need to turn scooter off when parked in front of a shop while shopping. I'm always afraid someone will just get on and ride away. I still don't know how I can do it practically with a switch and without sparks. By the way is spin - y2 throttle waterproof? Edit :spin-y2
[2023-11-19T00:23:31] Mirono escooters: Vesc button Loopkey

[2023-11-19T00:24:58] puneDir: What capacity capacitor is recommended
[2023-11-19T00:25:12] puneDir: Im not gonna cut the battery while going lol
[2023-11-19T00:25:15] puneDir: Front box will die

[2023-11-19T00:51:45] Mirono escooters: Cool
[2023-11-19T00:52:37] Mirono escooters: Not like Ninebot does over 30a
[2023-11-19T00:54:55] Paolo ‚Å≠: Support up to 15s , up to 50/60A continuos current and 100mA balacing current
[2023-11-19T00:55:18] Paolo ‚Å≠: And obviously real time app

[2023-11-19T00:56:53] Mirono escooters: Design time
[2023-11-19T00:57:14] puneDir: idk if its even worth

[2023-11-19T01:31:13] Martin Kaktits: How well does field weakening get a long with regen brake? If im doing 80kmh+ with field weakening and want to slow down, will regen brake work? Not cook vesc (spintend)?
[2023-11-19T01:32:22] Mirono escooters: Should be fine, dont see why not
[2023-11-19T01:32:40] Mirono escooters: If not going superspeed
[2023-11-19T01:32:50] Martin Kaktits: 80 is not superspeed?
[2023-11-19T01:32:53] Martin Kaktits: what about 100
[2023-11-19T01:33:16] Mirono escooters: I mean, superspeed over original speed
[2023-11-19T01:33:24] Mirono escooters: So backemf not too high Correct me if I'm wrong
[2023-11-19T01:33:36] Mirono escooters: Loading it would immediately drop it down tho
[2023-11-19T01:37:12] puneDir: G30 stem
[2023-11-19T01:37:35] puneDir: Custom made
[2023-11-19T01:37:53] puneDir: To fit snsc without cutting the suspension
[2023-11-19T01:38:44] Mirono escooters: Hahahaha cool
[2023-11-19T01:38:47] Mirono escooters: And raised height
[2023-11-19T01:38:50] Mirono escooters: Folding still works?
[2023-11-19T01:39:19] Mirono escooters: Idk If I wanna cut up mine Didn't you have to hammer a star nut in?
[2023-11-19T01:40:52] puneDir: Yes and its perfect
[2023-11-19T01:40:59] puneDir: Yes its in
[2023-11-19T01:41:09] puneDir: Not even vibration Its like one piece
[2023-11-19T01:41:40] puneDir: @Mirono_escooters my vesc shouldnt be affected from cutoff right? Because of ignition
[2023-11-19T01:42:03] puneDir: Stm closes in the same milisecond (Cuz ignition)
[2023-11-19T01:43:40] Mirono escooters: Yes it would
[2023-11-19T01:44:05] Mirono escooters: You still need the mod
[2023-11-19T01:44:21] puneDir: But it closes the switching in same moment?
[2023-11-19T01:44:43] Mirono escooters: It turns off the whole 12v rail
[2023-11-19T01:44:52] Mirono escooters: Together with guess what Mos drivers
[2023-11-19T01:45:06] puneDir: Yes but if close it while going nothing happens
[2023-11-19T01:45:18] Mirono escooters: Then you are being lucky
[2023-11-19T01:45:26] puneDir: I accidentally did that while going 45 and nothing happened
[2023-11-19T01:45:31] Mirono escooters: Yes but ususally STM go first
[2023-11-19T01:45:47] Mirono escooters: Not worth da risk
[2023-11-19T01:46:03] puneDir: Also elshan did it still nothing happened
[2023-11-19T01:46:21] Mirono escooters: Being lucky
[2023-11-19T01:46:30] Mirono escooters: Cutoff Is same as key switch electronically speaking.
[2023-11-19T01:46:54] puneDir: What can i do now lol Esc in the resin
[2023-11-19T01:46:56] Mirono escooters: Obviously
[2023-11-19T01:47:01] Mirono escooters: Powered w 5v
[2023-11-19T01:47:12] Mirono escooters: Well 3.3 from the rail
[2023-11-19T01:47:17] puneDir: only 5v and 3.3v is exposed
[2023-11-19T01:47:25] Mirono escooters: If they have it Kuch SPintend kuch flipsky
[2023-11-19T01:47:39] Mirono escooters: Cap to 3.3!
[2023-11-19T01:47:44] Mirono escooters: Or 5
[2023-11-19T01:47:46] puneDir: Its gonna be same right?
[2023-11-19T01:47:55] Mirono escooters: It can help
[2023-11-19T01:48:11] puneDir: actually i dont even need but would be good to add
[2023-11-19T01:48:30] Mirono escooters: Both
[2023-11-19T01:48:37] Mirono escooters: 12v rail responsible for both
[2023-11-19T01:48:47] puneDir: why they forget to add cap while designing the pcb?
[2023-11-19T01:48:49] Mirono escooters: So you keep STM on long enough to REACT to low v
[2023-11-19T01:48:59] puneDir: just to make a funny joke?
[2023-11-19T01:49:03] Mirono escooters: Morons
[2023-11-19T01:49:25] puneDir: designers: lol lets dont add anything so people will burn their escs

[2023-11-19T01:50:56] haku: do you use only regen? or you have physical brakes?
[2023-11-19T01:51:02] Mirono escooters: Non
[2023-11-19T01:51:12] Mirono escooters: Because their pcb has caps/ proper engineering.
[2023-11-19T01:51:15] puneDir: One rear drum And 25a regen
[2023-11-19T01:51:48] puneDir: im going to switch to vesc 6.05 because of regen works better with it
[2023-11-19T01:52:08] haku: rear drum how? dont you have double g30 motors?
[2023-11-19T01:52:21] puneDir: One rear is snsc
